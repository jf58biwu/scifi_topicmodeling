 [ Sally , typing ] It 's not easy being single in New York City , especially when you 're an alien visiting from a parallel universe . Uh-oh , that 's a little too much information . But there 's nothing a little success or a lot of sex can 't fix . Take Dick , for example . Finding his job shallow and unrewarding , he was ready to load the pockets of his custom-tailored suit with rocks and jump in the East River . Oh , my God . Look at those shoes . Then he walked into a dive on 48th where people ordered drinks on the rocks . There he found his true love , and that rocks . I 'm a lawyer . While on the other side of town , Tommy was a big success on Saturday Night Live . His head was as big as the Statue of Liberty 's , only there weren 't any tourists inside his face , And Harry , either through sheer determination or sheer stupidity , was climbing to the top of his game as a network executive . Why don 't we make one night Will , one night Grace ? As for me , I 've heard it said that you can 't fight City Hall . I don 't know if that 's true or not , I just needed a segue into 'I 'm sleeping with the Mayor . ' ♪ Romance is mush ♪ ♪ Stifling those who strive ♪ ♪ I live a lush life ♪ ♪ In some small dive ♪ ♪ And there I 'll be ♪ ♪ While I rot with the rest ♪ ♪ Of those whose lives ♪ ♪ are lonely ♪ ♪ Too ♪ Oh , Mary , that was beautiful . Much more upbeat than usual . Sweetie , I am hurrying . These boots are super-high , plus they 're really tight , you know . Just put it down , would ya ? Don , I hope you realize that this place is a total waste of my outfit . Well , as long as I can see it , what else matters ? You are such a doll . Let 's go someplace else . You know I can 't . Of course , I do . Um , Tommy ? Hey , Darrell , what 's up ? Um , nothing . I just saw Ana out in the hallway . She 's crying her eyes out . What happened ? Yeah , I broke up with her . Oh ... sorry . I- - Well , I was chomping at the bit , you know what I mean ? Sure . Sure . Don 't mean anything by it . You know , Tommy , it 's really funny how quickly you guys hit it off . I 've been trying to get Ana to go out with me for years , and she just never would- - And she never will , man . Because she doesn 't know who the real Darrell Hammond is . What does that mean ? You hide behind your impressions , man . With all your wigs , your funny voices . She sees the mask and she doesn 't see the man . Whoa . Let me ask you a question . What are you doin on update this week ? I was gonna do Sean Connery talking about how it feels to be a senior citizen . Yeah , well , why don 't you do Darrell Hammond talking about what it feels like to be ... to be Darrell Hammond ? I 've been blind . Tommy , I 've been blind . Thanks , buddy . Hey . Thank you . No problem , guy . You know , I don 't think it 's such a good idea for you to be spending so much time in a seedy bar like this , Mary . Maybe , instead , you should be singing in a Broadway show . What a great idea . But I 'm way ahead of you , handsome . It won 't be long before I 'll be joining the cast of Cats . I 've got bad news for you . Mary , Cats is closed . Damn , that was fast ! Look . Here . I 've got something that 'll cheer you up . Ooh . Saks . Oh , you shouldn 't have done this . Please , accept it . I never said anything about not accepting it . It 's beautiful . The saleslady called it a cocktail dress . I thought you 'd get a lot of use out of it . Okay . So , I know you 're not supposed to go anyplace else , but , bear with me here , what if we did ? What do you think would happen ? Well , you know what would happen . Oh , I know . But tell me anyway . Well , you-know-who would have my ass in a sling . [ chuckles ] Oh , yeah . I know . Who ? The wife . Of course . Your wife . You 're married ? Simmer down . Oh , my God . You 're married ! This is so not good ! What 's going on ? You 've been okay with this arrangement for years . I have ? I can 't believe I 'd do that . I am out of here . Come on . Baby , baby , baby . You know you 're the one . I 'm gonna divorce her . I just need a little time . Okay . Sally . Dick . Don . Albright . Kiki . Donnie . Mary ! [ Darrell ] Um , you know , New York is the only city ... Isn 't that the guy who normally does the impressions ? Darrell . Darrell Hammond . Yeah . Why isn 't he funny ? Some sort of experiment . He wanted to impress Ana Gasteyer , so he was gonna try being himself . Ah . Well , that 's a big mistake , man . Man ! That felt so great ! Tommy , they were really listening to me , weren 't they ? They were , man . They were listenin for some jokes , and they weren 't quite hearing ' em . You know what ? I 've been known to do an impersonation myself . Yeah . Here 's you . " Boo-hoo-hoo . I 'm Darrell Hammond . " I don 't got a job no more . " Boo-hoo-hoo . How am I gonna feed my child ? Boo-hoo-hoo . " Hi , Tommy . Hi , Mr. Solomon . Did you see Darrell ? Um , yeah . Yeah , some of it . Ana , that part about me breaking my foot on my sixth birthday , that really happened , man . Fact is so much stranger than fiction . Stranger , but it 's not funnier . Hey , guys , check this out . [ as Sean Connery ] Could somebody please tell me where I can find Miss Pussy Galore ? I didn 't know you did Sean Connery . That 's good . You oughta do that on the show . Can I open my eyes now ? No . Just a ... just a few more steps . Oh , Dick , I 've had my eyes closed ever since the oyster bar . What was that crunchy thing you made me eat ? I don 't know . I had my eyes closed , too . Okay , you can look now . The Manhattan skyline . Hmm . Got anything to drink ? Champagne . I opened it this morning so those annoying little bubbles would have a chance to disperse . Good thinking . Cheers . Would you care for an hors d 'oeuvre ? Duck eggs ? Salmon eggs ? Quail eggs ? Eggs ? Anything you want . The sky 's the limit . Dick , if you 're intent on spending money on me , I can think of other ways of doing it . Well , like how ? Like giving me money . I 'm sorry , was that too blunt ? Yes , but money 's not important . What 's important is that we love each other . What we have is true love . I can 't do it . I can 't take advantage of another deluded guy . No , you 're wrong , Mary . You 're the one who 's deluded . Because whether you know it or not , we were meant to be together . Oh , God . I love you , Mary . Oh , stop talking about love . True love doesn 't exist . True love is real . And powerful and wonderful ! Oh , don 't you think I 'd like to believe in love ? Life would be a lot simpler if I could . Then pretend . How ? It 's easy . ♪ [ romantic jazz plays ] What 's that smell ? [ sniffs ] Is that platinum ? Oh . Oh , Donnie . Thank you , baby . What are you doing here ? Isn 't there some sort of riot in the Bronx ? Yeah . Good thing we don 't live up there . Sally , what would you say if I told you that when my wife asked me why I was gonna be late again tonight , I didn 't lie ? Oh , my God . You told her you wanted a divorce ? No , I told her to shut up . Uh , okay . You know , I 'm starting to feel real bad . I don 't know how much longer I can do this . Well , hang in there . I 'll tell my wife as soon as I 'm out of office . I can 't wait till you step down as mayor . Not mayor . President . I 'm going for the big one . And I want you right there beside me . Behind the scenes . Out of sight . That is not good enough for me , Don . I mean , I wanna be involved in your life and share tender moments . I want to be your Secretary of Defense . Let 's slow down and reconsider this in the shower . You know what ? Forget it . Sally- - No , no , no . Seriously , it 's over . Get out ! One last thing . Can I still count on your vote ? Of course . We still agree on the issues . [ knocking on the door ] Just a minute . Come in . Hey , look at that putt I just made . Lovely . Very nice . Yeah . Mr. Solomon , your nephew is here to see you . Tommy ! Good to see you ! Good to see you , too , man . It 's funny . We work in the same building , I 've never been up to your office . It 's very nice . Yeah , well , lots of room to putt in . Oh , hey , can I sit in your chair ? Oh , please . I think you 'll find it still warm . [ sighs ] " Hey , look at me . I 'm Harry Solomon , big president of the network . " " Look at me , I 'm Tommy Solomon , and I 'm a big star on Saturday Night Live . " " I make important decisions like where to putt in my office . " " I get paid the big bucks just for going whoo-whoo-whoo . " " Well , I 've got some news for you , Tommy Solomon . " Your ego 's gotten too big . You 're demanding too much money . You 're fired ! " " I am out of control , and I do want too much money . You 're fired ! " " You can 't fire me , you peon . You 're a lowly cast member on SNL . " No , I 'm Harry now . You 're fired ! What ? Yeah , I mean it . You 're really fired . What for ? Well , for the same reasons that you just fired me . Your ego 's too huge and you want too much money . Well , I 'm not taking it anymore . You 're off the show . I am that show . Wait a second . Who are you now ? I 'm me . Well , then get away from my desk ! You 're confusing me . You listen to me . Lorne Michaels is my boss . He can fire me . You can 't fire me . Well , I 'll fire his sad Canadian ass , too . Good morning . Good morning . Well , this is different . Well , what do you mean ? Being here with me ? No , I mean I can actually remember everything I did last night . So do I. I feel wonderful . In fact , there 's something important I have to ask you . Hmm ? Will you ... Will you move in with me ? Move into this beautiful loft ? Yes . We can have movers bring over all your things , or we could just burn them . Okay . What the hell ? Oh , yes ! See , Mary ? You see ? How does it feel now ? What ? To know that you 're in love with me ? Oh , look , I liked the Gershwin , and the eager-to-please lovemaking . Oh , we were so passionate . You called out my name three times . " Larry ! Larry ! Larry ! " Okay , maybe it 's not my name , but the passion . I was pretending . You told me to pretend , so I pretended . No , but it 'll turn real . I know it will . Sorry , Dick . That will never happen . Love . Ha ! Mary Albright can 't feel love anymore . You 're so damaged ! This life has been so hard on you . Isn 't there anything I can do to make you see that we would be perfect together ? No , Dick . Maybe it would 've worked in some other time or some other place . Wait . What did you just say ? No , Dick . Maybe it would 've worked in some other time ... [ both ] or some other place . I can do that . Here , quick . Mary , take this . Come on . Come on with me . You 're just like all the rest , tossing me out . You didn 't even let me get dressed . No , no , I still want you to live here , Mary . Go back to your place and get your things right now . Here , here 's some extra cash . You can get dressed in the cab . Are you sure you wanna do this ? Absolutely . This is your home now . I hope it 'll make you happy . Good-bye , Kiki . Bye . Sally ! Sally , wake up ! Ugh ! What ? We 're leaving . I 'm going home to Mary . Wait a minute . But she 's here . No . This Mary is cold and soulless , and only willing to do one or two more things in bed than the other one . The tradeoff just isn 't worth it . All right , look . Maybe you are willing to give up all this nice stuff , but I sure am not . I mean , whoever said that diamonds are a girl 's best friend never saw those black pearls at Tiffany 's . Hey , that sounded great . Where 's my laptop ? No . Forget the laptop . I would think that given what 's happened , you 'd be dying to see Don again . I don 't know . I mean , after Mayor Don , I just feel like I 've seen a side of him I really can 't trust . But that 's not the Don you love . The one who went to community college , and went to night school to become a cop . And went to another night school after that one didn 't work out . The Don who wouldn 't hurt a fly . The Don who loves you . I wish that Don was here in this apartment . No kidding . I 'd almost be willing to shack up here with New York Mary if she wasn 't such a big ball of emotional scar tissue . Wow . We are gonna sacrifice money for love . We are so noble ! I know ! How many shoes do you think I can get through that portal , huh ? Well , I 'm off to work . Is my car here yet ? Harry , we 're going back to Rutherford . Well , have a nice trip . I think I left the iron on , so you might wanna check . No , Harry . Um , you 're coming with us . I don 't think you understand . I have got a network to run ! Look , we 're not leaving you here alone . I 'm not alone . Tommy 's here . No , he went through the portal after you fired him . Harry , you can 't be a network president alone in Manhattan without adult supervision . Stop it ! You 're treating me the way you always treat me . Well , we 're in New York now , and I 'm respected here . You get his arms , I 'll get his legs . What ? No ! Dubcek , I 've got a situation here . Send security to the loft . Huh ? What ? Well , that 's a shocker . Mm-hmm . I see . Yeah . Well , good luck . I don 't believe it ! What ? I 've been replaced by Dubcek . I 'm so sorry , Harry . They said that she was really in touch with what men between 18 and 49 really want . I see . Last one in the shower 's a dirty dog ! Whoo ! Oh , shoes ! Ah , that was great . Oh , home at last ! Ah , the damn shoes don 't transfer ! Good old Rutherford . What an inspiring view . Yeah , the tail lights on the cars and the flame burning over at the refinery . You can even see the fast food signs out at the interstate off ramp . It 's simply breathtaking . I find it dumpy and depressing . Yeah , well , not the pancake house . Albright , you wanna see depressing , you should see all the garbage they have stacked up along Central Park West . Were you in New York recently ? No . No . Sally was , uh , just looking at a travel brochure . Was I a man who dreamed he was a network executive , or a network executive who dreamed he was a man ? Human beings- - That is , we human beings are so strange . We blindly go about our daily activities , unaware that if we only made a few slightly different choices , we 'd turn out to be completely different people . Yeah . Different , lying , cheating , weasely , horrible people ! Did I do something ? Oh , no , babe . You 're perfect just the way you are . So are you , Mary . Well , I 'm gonna go watch TV . My shows are on . Closed-Captioned by JR Media Services , Inc . Burbank , CA

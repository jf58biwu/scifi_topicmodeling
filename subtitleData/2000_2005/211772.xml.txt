 Previously on Farscape . If you keep moving out of the planet 's shadow ... we 'll lose contact entirely . Can 't be helped , Pilot . Solar flares are what I came to see . Holy mother ... that 's a wormhole ! It looks unstable . And it 's pulling us in ! Full reverse thrusters ! Guys , I might have just found a way home . Look , you 're gonna have to speed up repairs - What for ? - I gotta get back up there . I 'm collecting data . The ability to create a stable wormhole ... travel through space and time , would be incredibly ... - Profitable . - Probably . I 'll download you a copy of the data as soon as I get back aboard the ship . Exclusive rights , or there 's no deal . The data . You made me think ... you were my father We brought you here to recreate your memory . Why not just ... make a wormhole to take you to Earth ? That would use all our remaining power . Show me ... what you really look like . Many of us hoped that Earth might be our welcoming place . But the highest lifeform on the planet is also the most destructive . You 're humans would kill us . - So what will you do now ? - We continue searching for a home . These equations are necessary for creating a wormhole . You cannot access this data conciously . You won 't remember this part of our encounter . The unconcious knowledge we 've given you ... will guide you . Ah , the Ancients were here first , implanting the wormhole knowledge I seek . But , when my Aurora Chair failed to unlock that information , I had to implement ... a second strategy . You put something in my head . A very sophisticated neuro-chip . It contains me . Or a mental clone of my ah ... personality . And now ... on Farscape . - Gu ... - Gu-ah-un . - Gun . - Gun . Do the next one . Su-ah-nuh . Sun . - Sun . - Sun . You know that everyone thinks your crazy as a banta bug . Yeah , what else is new ? Mmm . You still hearing it ? Hmm ... feeling it . It 's like a homing signal . Or a trap ... Scorpius trap . No , no , no . I know Scorpius . This is different . All right , so let 's say it is this alien who takes the form of your father . Why would they come looking for you now ? I have no idea . I thought the Ancients were done with me . Why ... don 't you ... just ignore it ? Why do you want to look for it ? Because I 'm not done with them . Do you think I 'm crazy ? Mmm . I 've always thought you were crazy . You know that . - Do you know why ... I 'm crazy ? - Why are you crazy ? - You . - Me ? You . - Aeryn . - What ? Out there . - What ? - Look . Oh no ! Not again ! - Have you seen this before ? - Unfortunately , yes ! And so 's Crichton Yes , Talyn . Appearances to the contrary . This planet seems to have no mass . It must be a illusion . It 's a billboard . It means we 've found what we 're lookin ' for . Hello , anybody out there ? Ancients . Jack . Whatever you want to call yourself . This is John Crichton . Hello ... Come out , come out , wherever you are . I 'm here . - Talyn ! - Crais , no . I know this guy . And I thought I knew you . I may have been wrong . If I was ... I may have to kill you . Let him go , or I will shoot . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship- - this living ship ... of escaped prisoners- - my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay , protect my home , not show them you exist . But then you 'll never know the wonders I 've seen What the heck is this ? Our last encounter left a residual link between our minds . - I summoned you with it . - Right , got it . Make your point . My race was looking for a world to inhabit . Yeah , I know , but Earth didn 't work for you , so I can 't help you there . We found a world , perfectly suited to us . The Ancients are there now . Well , congratulations . What can I do for you then ? On our travel to the new world , we saw this ... Your module ... being flown though an unstable wormhole piloted by this creature . What ... ? Who the hell is that ? You tell me . No idea . Never seen one before . When was this ? A third of a cycle ago . Well , my module was safe aboard Moya a third of a cycle ago Are you saying this is a duplication ? I 'm saying I don 't know anything at all about it . What 's that device ? A phase stabilizer . Allows travel through any wormhole . Technology only a few could duplicate . Did you teach this creature to build it ? How would I do that when I don 't know how to build it ? Are you speaking the truth ? Jack ... you 're a mind reading alien ... like my dad . Don 't you know when I 'm speaking the truth ? I can only penetrate your mind this deep . Bummer . We gave you a gift . You misused it . What gift ? If you didn 't build that stablizer , who did ? I don 't know . What the hell ? ! Sorry , but I need your attention . And we only have a few moments . This is a facinating place in your memory ... - and hard to find . - What do you want ? ! Discretion ! That false father image will terminate us both if he learns of my existence . There 's no reason he should . Scorpius didn 't copy your module . How do you know ? Tell me this , John ... could you rebuild a module from memory , huh ? ! Probably not . Neither could Scorpius . All he knows ... is what my neuro chip absorbed from you ! So , who did it ? Who else knows of your wormhole search ? Who has both ... access to your module , and the expertise to replicate it , hmm ? - Furlow . - Elementary ! Either that , or you 're covering ' your ass . Why give Jack ... irrelevant information which may only provoke him into killing us all ! Aeryn included . Why would he kill Aeryn ? Gamble with her life if you want , tell him everything ! But don 't say you weren 't warned ! Maybe Furlow . - The mechanic ? - Yeah - From Dam-Ba-Da ? - That 's the one . So , why don 't you go bug her ? And can we please ... get out of my head ? He 's unhurt Aeryn Sun . We may have misjudged you . I hope we did . Who are you ? My given name is ... You can call me Jack . - How did you get on board ? - Save it , Crais . We got bigger fish to fry . Jack , shown ' em the ... postcard . Maybe they can identify the pilot . You guys know what that critter is ? I don 't recognize the species ... Crais ? I 'll just check Talyn 's databanks . Fa-pu-tah ! It was a Charrid , Stark ! A frelling Charrid You 're familiar with that species ? Oh , a thousand cycles ago , the Charrids invaded Hynerian space . They killed a billion of my people ate a million of our young . I 'm sorry , I didn 't know . We finally repelled them with suicide attacks . Wave after wave after wave . More death than even you could fathom ... Until we drove them off ! But if they had wormholes , they could come back and ... And attack us without warning and disappear before we could retaliate ? ! We have no defense against that ! Oh ... ! Quiet ... I know a Delvian chant that is very calming in times of stress . Say it with me ... Stop it , you lunatic ! Get it through what 's left of that head of yours that this is serious ! More serious than you can imagine . Unconfirmed intelligence reports suggest an alliance between the Charrids and the Scarrans . Lay it on me , Jack . Why are you so afraid of a Halloween mask in a tiny module ? Because they were on a course similar to ours , which may have led them right to the new home of the Ancients . All right , I understand ... you 're concerned about your privacy . But you guys are god-like aliens with the power of wormholes . We 're a dyin ' race , John . The voyage made us weaker . We may not be able to defend against a hostile species . That 's why I stayed behind . To make sure no one could find them . - You missed the boat ? - I volunteered . But you can catch up ? Unlikely . Well , Jack , this may all be for nothing . Funnyface could be Furlow 's test pilot , but ... Furlow 's not a hostile species , she 's an entrepenuer . We can buy her out and everybody 's gonna be happy . Then we should contact this Furlow and investigate . Yeah , you 're probably right . If Furlow 's on to something , I want to know about it . That 's Dam-Ba-Da ? - I thought it was populated ? - It appears to be sterilized . Spaceport 's been leveled . By what ? Unknown . Talyn detects no weapon installations . Any life signs ? Talyn can 't detect anything at this distance . It could be camoflaged or underground . Talyn ? Flare activity from this star could damage your systems . When we 're gone get into the planet 's shadow ... . ... and shut down all the exterior systems you can So , you think we really need all this stuff ? I hope not , but we don 't know what we 're going to find . Yeah ... sorry to screw up your life again . Yeah , as long as you know it 's all your fault . - Me and my damn wormholes . - Not all wormholes are bad . No ... but , ah , if I hadn 't'a been huntin ' wormholes , we never would have run into Furlow or the Ancients . If you hadn 't fallen into a wormhole , you never would have met ... Rygel . Furlow , I would think , is a better match for you . You could pool your knowledge and chase wormholes all you want . Furlow , yeah , she 's sexy . She 's a good one to take home and meet the folks . What ? You didn 't think I planned on goin ' home alone , did ya ? I haven 't been thinking about it I wouldn 't ... ... want to do that . To go back alone . I wouldn 't want you to . We should talk about this . Some other time ? Yeah . We could do lunch . Still can 't detect any activity on the planet surface . Here , Stark . Thank you . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Put ' em on . Flare 's coming . - How do you know ? - I can sense them . It 'll occur in ten microts . Be a good time to land , it 'll cover our approach . Where 's your goggles ? He doesn 't need ' em , Fluffy , those aren 't his real eyes . Everybody hang on . All right , seat belt sign is off . Aeryn , Crais ... we 're up . The entrance is open ! - Get down ! - Take cover ! Where the hell 's that cross fire coming from ? ! Aeryn , can you see anything ? ! - No , it 's the flares ! - Maybe it 's just a couple 'a guys ! Okay , maybe not . Here they come ! Talyn , stay in shadow ! Don 't expose your senses to the intensity of the solar flare ! He knows we 're in trouble and he 's coming back to help us ! - Well , tell him to stop ! - He refuses ! What are you doing ? They 're cut off . There 's nothing we can do here . You try to leave , and you 'll be cut off . Another flare is coming ... 20 microts . Talyn , a flare is imminent shut down your senses ! Break off ! No , Talyn ! Go back ! Do it , Talyn ! Talyn , reverse direction ! Head for the dark side of the planet ! Take it out ! Pull back ! We gotta get to that bunker . - How 's Crais ? - I can 't see ! Talyn is blinded , and so am I ! Stark , come down here now , and take Crais back to the pod ! Crichton and I will have to go on alone You stay here . You stay under cover . Cover me . Fire in the hole ! He said help me , you idiot ! Not chant me over to the other side ! Well , well , well . If it isn 't my favorite flyboy . Just couldn 't stay away from me , huh ? What the hell happened to you ? You know , I 'd be happy to tell ya all about it if you 'd just cut me the frell down ! Furlow ! What ? Save someone for questioning . How many troops on the planet ? Bring any sisters ? You won 't be enough to pleasure all of us . How many ! My , grandma ... what big teeth you have . We 'll feast on you tonight and tomorrow , all your families ! Yeah , and you can have our pets for breakfast . - Communicator ? - I think so . Might be able to listen in . How many ways into this place , Furlow ? Except for the front door ? None . All of the approaches are booby-trapped and some of the automatic guns are still working . - " Some . " ? - Probably . - I 'll check the perimeter . - That 's a good idea . Do me a favor ? Take Smiley here and stash him somewhere on your way out . You fear me ! No , you just smell . Move ! What the hell is this ? What do you think ? A truely fine copy of your module . Got a nice detailed scan last time you were here . Yeah , when you ripped off all my data . You know , you 're ... gonna have to let that go , Johnny . Point is ... I flew through a wormhole ... four times and not just a wormhole a proto-wormhole . Unstable as all flitz ... didn 't even muss my hair . How long have the Charrid 's been here ? I hired ' em ... for security . They even did the first test flights . Then ... a couple of solar days ago the blotchers double-crossed me . Killed all my techs i tried to torture the secret outta me get the passwords to my computers , but ah ... I 'm tougher than they thought . Right . - Oh , one more thing . - What ? Thanks for the rescue . Transport pod ... ... all clear outside . Aeryn , my link with Talyn is gone . He 's blinded and panicked . I must find him and board him quickly . All right . Stark , send in Rygel and Jack you try and take Crais back to Talyn . Uh , w-wait a microt . I 'll fly Crais back . We get Talyn working , we can kill more Charrids quicker . No , no , no , no ! Stark knows Talyn , he can help calm him down . Let me be your eye ! Perfect ! The half-blind leading the blind . No , he 's right Rygel . Get in here . She likes me more than she likes you . What happened to this planet ? Looks like it 's been carpet bombed . Solar flares got bigger than ever . Most everybody cleared out . Solar flares ? The last time I was here you said there weren 't gonna be any solar flares for 4.8 cycles . I lied . You lied . Yeah , I figgered it 'd keep you away for a while , so I could ... work in peace . Charrids are keeping their distance , but it won 't last forever . - They are regrouping . - I 'm tellin ' ya , they 're not gonna get in . - Who 's he ? - We call him Jack . Jack , Furlow . Furlow , Jack . Hands off the merchandise there ... Jack . Give me the tool so I can open this up . Give me one reason why I oughta let ya ? Can I give you two ? We just saved your life and this gun . - Fair enough . - Another flare ... 10 microts . Pod ? Another flare , 8 microts . We 're ready . Well ... some more than others . - Crichton , can you hear me ? - Of course not ! - Not while the flares happening . - Oh , right . - I don 't like this planet much . - Neither do I. - Just stay on the vector I gave you ! - We 're on vector ! - Don 't worry , we 'll find Talyn . - Finding Talyn is just the beginning of our task . Talk to me , Johnny . Who is that thoddo ? He 's one of the last remaining members of an ancient alien race ... who knows all about wormholes . Um-hm . So , what 's he doin ' here ? Making sure it doesn 't fall into the wrong hands . Right , well ... he can have the technology ... if ... he can afford it . I think we should tie her back up . - Don 't tempt me . - No , I said tie her back up . A Hynerian . Good timing . I 'm hungry . Pity you 're so aged . You won 't be so tasty . Don 't glare at me ! I 'm not impressed . You think a Hynerian could ever frighten me ? ! Oh , I 'm not here to frighten you . No , no , no , no , no ! Then what ? To question me ? Plainly you are unaware of our superior resistance to pain ! Actually , I do know something about Charrid physiology . Just as I know something about your weaponry . This ractor , for instance , contains neural circuits that inflict ten times the normal pain . Designed to be effective even against your own kind . - A very unpleasant death . - You don 't dare kill me ! - Don 't I ? - The others want me alive ! Yes . Well , plainly you 're unaware of one more fact : I don 't give a garanta 's brax what the others want . Primitive ... underpowered ... It 's only a prototype ... ya welnitz . The underlying technology 's sound . You bet your frangle it is . What have you done ? Who else has this knowledge ? Nobody got it from me . And they won 't , unless of course ... they can meet my price . You 'd sell this to anyone ? ! Excuse me ? Is that any of your business ? Yes ! You have no idea what this can do ! Sure I do . That 's how I know it 'll make me rich . Mortar fire . Well , the Charrids are gettin ' bold again . Can this structure withstand a mortar attack ? - Probably . - Frell . Ah , let ' em come if they dare ... that 's my motto . Rygel ? - What have you done ? - Interrogating . I thought he 'd last much longer than that . He did tell me that there is a Scarran Dreadnought heading for this planet . It 'll arrive within six arns . I 'm hearing more and more calls on their comm net . They 're gettin ' ready to storm the castle . Crais , can you hear me ? Stark ? Keep tryin ' . Those flares play hezmana with comm signals . Can that ship of yours stand up to a Scarran Dreadnought ? Not a chance . Even if he could see , it 's about twice the size of a Command Carrier . - We have to do something . - We will , come on . - W-w-where are we going ? - You like killing Charrids ? - Now 's your chance . - But , I ah ... - This doesn 't worry you ? - Nah . Even if they do get in a lucky hit and breach a wall ... the booby-traps will get ' em before they get in . - You hope . - I know . If the Charrids hadn 't jumped me in orbit , they 'd'a never gotten in . They breach the defenses , we 're gonna have to act fast . " Act fast " ? You have ... some kind of plan ? We don 't let the bad guys get the technology . Tarbik grenades ... - surely you 're not suggesting ... - We destroy it . - What can you see ? ! - Damage , damage , damage . Whatever would I do without your verbal gifts ? ! Oh , you want more words ? Well , the conduits are damaged , bulkheads damaged , external sensors damaged too ! There is nothing that is not damaged . - Least of all , you ! - I can see ! If only you could think ! Talyn ! I know you are scared , but you must be able to hear me ! Turn to your treblin side and accelerate . - Get deeper into the planet 's shadow ! - Better , better ! I can find my way on my own ship ! Are you ready now ? - What 's this ? - It 's an automated gun turret . Well , it doesn 't look like it 's working . Well , the targeting system 's gone , but everything else is still intact . You can operate it manually . - I can ? - Yeah . That 's where you reload , this is aim , and this is fire . Now , if you can 't actually hit anything just make sure you force the Charrids to keep well away from us . - Uh , where will you be ? - I 'll be somewhere else . Oh , we work better as a team ! Well , you didn 't need any help when you were knifing the Charrid . This is different , I 'm unprotected here ! What happens if they fire in a mortar shell ? That 's simple : you 'll die , so keep them back . You keep them back ! You 're the artillery expert ! Tell me something , Rygel . How many Hynerians perished in the suicide attacks when they repelled the Charrids ? Millions upon millions . - Any of them volunteer , or were they all forced ? - Why ? I 'm just curious to know whether sacrifice and bravery are Hynerian concepts . Show me how this works again . That 's your reload , that 's your aim , and this is your fire . Good-bye . You still don 't understand how dangerous this technology can be ? A wormhole isn 't just a shortcut through space , it can be turned into a weapon of incredible destruction . And we can 't let the Scarrans have that kind of power . Okay , so we , ah , turn around and sell it to the Peacekeepers . Maybe the Nebari , too . Balance of power , and we ... clean up . The potential for distaster is too great . The danger is clear . It isn 't clear to me . You know , I think ... all this high-minded talk is a pile of dren . And you 're just tryin ' to take out a competitor . - I speak the truth . - Oh yeah ? And why should I believe you ? Where do you get all this cosmic knowledge ? Who are you to tell me what I should do ? What the frell ? Who are you ? Someone who understands the risks of power . Do you , Furlow ? Do you understand the future you 're about to create ? Are you willing to see entire planets and entire civilizations wiped out ? Put your weapon down . Put it down ... now . Aeryn , you have explosives in your pack ? - Yes . - Set them . He , ah ... that alien ... - why didn 't you tell me ? - I think I did . Fair enough . You know , this , this really isn 't necessary . We could , uh , just beat it before the Dreadnought gets here . You , me ... ... in the module , down the wormhole . Sell the technology . Uh , only to , uh , peaceful races of course . And what about the others ? Well ... same thing happens whether we 're here or not . Listen , the Scarrans aren 't gonna leave anybody breathing . No reason for all of us to die . - What 's with your computer ? - Somebody 's tapped in . - They 're stealing all my data . - Shut it down ! I can 't . They 've got full control . Stand clear . Now . Who tapped in ? A remote download , overrode all my passcodes . Charrids are too stupid for that . - Had to be Scarrans . - How much data did they get ? Oh , enough to make their own phase stablizer . But the Dreadnought will still get here . They 'll want to make sure that nobody else gets the prototype , ... and ... what 's in here . And , ah ... you know that thing we were talkin ' about earlier ? It 's lookin ' even better now . - We need to destroy that data . - Are you payin ' attention ? 'Cause , it 's too late . - The data is on the Dreadnought now . - Exactly . Therefore we need to destroy the Dreadnought . There isn 't anything on this planet that would even get it 's attention ! What thing you were talking about earlier ? Oh , nothing . - You got a plan ? - Yes ... something the Ancients wouldn 't permit . Their sanctuary 's under threat . I believe we can convert this phase stabilizer to another function . We ? Yes , your knowledge of this level of technology is greater than mine . Alone , I 'd never be able to complete the modifications in time . Except , I don 't know how this thing works , much less how to modify it . - I won 't be much help . - Yes , you will . During our last encounter the ancients embedded something else deep within your memory . The equations to create wormholes . It wasn 't meant to be accessed consciously , but merely to guide you . Guide me ? Why not just give it to me ? Because it was important that you develop it on your own or else not at all . Is that some sorta rule ? Only hints , otherwise it 's cheating ? There were Ancients who didn 't want to give you anything . This knowledge is very dangerous . Yeah , I know ... so give me the useless consolation prize . No , not useless . It was meant to keep you on the right path . Possibly subtracting years from your research . " Possibly " . Well ... thanks for the help . John , this knowledge may save all of our lives here . I can unlock it . And what will your friends think about that ? They 'd stop me if they could . If they knew what you and I were creating here , they 'd kill us both . That 's terrific . Jack , I already got half the universe after me , I really want the Ancients on my ass as well . We don 't have a choice . That Dreadnought is less than 5 hours from here . I need your expert help , if you 're unwilling to give it ... I didn 't say ... I wouldn 't help . Good . Furlow , get me all the tools and components that you have . I need wave-guides , circuitry , anything . It would help if I knew what you were making . I also need some nuclear fuel ... tenth of a mallot of partanium isotope would do it . Coming right up . Jack ... I have a ... confession to make . I knew about the stuff you guys put in my head . How ? Guy named Scorpius . He discovered the info was there , and he put a neural chip in my head to extract the information . And he succeeded ? Well , the chips gone , so I 'd say , yes ... more or less . Why didn 't you tell me ? All right ... there 's more . When the chip was pulled , a chunk of Scorpius 's personality was left behind . A neural clone ? You could call it that . I call it , ah ... Harvey . Then we can 't unlock the information in front of this clone . So , what do you wanna do ? My mental energy is limited . But , I believe between the two of us we can drive this clone from your mind . Could you say that with a little more confidence ? I don 't know how strong this clone is ... Before you rejoin them , John , we must speak . You cannot be seriously considering my removal . Yes , I can . I 've had time to acclimate myself to your brain . To permeate every facet of your mind . I will not go easily ! Are you ... ... threatening me ? I warn you , John , if you attempt this ... I will fight you , and I will win ! If your brain really isn 't big enough for the both of us , either I 'll survive ... or neither of us will . Harvey ... kiss my medulla oblongata . You think I 'm bluffing ? Do you want to die ? ! What the frell ... ? ! We 're closed , ya thoddoes ! John ! Are you all right ? John ? Yeah ... um , fine . I don 't see a lot of choice . Harvey 's gotta go . And you can do this , Jack ? I can infuse him with all the mental capacity that I possess . Which you admit is limited . We take what we can get . Is there some way to transfer energy ? Can you ... link his mind with mine ? No . Aeryn Sun , John already has your strength . And someone 's gotta stay on the outside in case everything goes pear-shaped . I know what to do . Hey ! Anybody there ? ! I 've scored nine direct hits ! But that Charrids aren 't getting the message . They 're getting closer , and I 'm running out of ammo ! All right . I 'll get you some . Frelling Charrids ! Just don 't ... start anything until I get back . Here 's your partanium . Trouble is , I don 't know if I can scrape up a protection suit . - I don 't need one . - No kiddin ' . Imagine if he was on our side . He is on our side . What I will need is a focused trans-emitter coil so that I can maximize the power output . Boy , you don 't want much do ya ? Hope you 're not in a hurry . - We 're in a hurry . - I 'll do my best . - Are you sure you don 't want help ? - I don 't need your help ! - Talyn , can you hear me ? - Nothing 's happening ! Well , apart from the tossing and turning . He 's overcompensating for his maneuvers because he can 't tell what 's going on . I-I 'll have to take over . - What are you looking for ? ! - Manual overide ! Here ! Talyn , I am taking control . I will keep you stable so you can calm down and heal your senses . It 's working , I think . It 's working , working ! - Is the navigation console responding ? - No , but I 'm feeling better . Something doesn 't feel right . Must be the ... must be the docking control ... It looks all right . Try the comms again . Boost Talyn 's signal to maximum . Aeryn ? Crichton ? - Can you hear me ? - Stark ? Is that you ? We 're trying to take control of Talyn he 's still blind , but ... at least he 's calm . Can he fight ? Stark ? Can you hear me ? Frell . - About time ! - You let two through . Two ? But I turned at least 12 of them to sand stains . Ah-ha ! Here comes number 13 ! Oh , miscalculated the windage . Next time I 'll get him . - Did I ever tell you about Rygel the 9th ? - No . Single-handedly led the climactic charge at the battle of Katreen . - He was a hero ? - He was a moron ! Dominars are far too valuable for combat , much less front-lines . But ... you know , strangely enough ... I think I understand why he did it ! Ah , ha , ha ! Second try ! Taste this , bloodsucker ! We 'll make a soldier out of you yet , Rygel . Well , don 't think I 'm gonna make a habit of it . Hmm . Now ! It 's time . Buckle up Scorp , we 're goin ' for a little ride . You don 't have to do this , John . I , I pose you no threat . Right . I happen to know , that the wormhole knowledge is still inside your brain but I don 't want it ! - Your better half does . - Well , he has a copy . But whether he knows how to make use of it ... is not my concern ! Therefore ... there 's no reason to get rid of me . Yeah , there is . No , it 's the truth , John . I don 't want to overtake you . I 'm happy to ... coexist . I 'm not ! Oh , stop this , John . I 've helped you countless times . I 've even saved your life ! To save yourself . You don 't get brownie points for that Scorp . Oh , but I can help you now ! That alien ... he 's using you ! And after you 've done his dirty work for him , ... he will terminate you , Furlow , Rygel , Stark , Aeryn ... Do not play the Aeryn card , Scorp , you killed her ! Aeryn is alive ! Now Zhaan 's gone , who do I thank for that ? ! Oh ! Stop this , John ! Or we 'll both die ! How can you die Scorp , when you 're not even real ? ! Oh , I can feel it , I can feel it , we 're both going to die ! We 're both going to die ! Can you feel it ? ! Why should I care ? ! - Because I am part of you , John ! - Yeah , I know ! And I 'm sick of it ! John , what 's happening ? John ! - Help me , John . - Go to hell , Scorpy ! For everything there is a season . A time to keep , and a time to cast away . I warned you ! Jack ? John ? That 's it ! Keep running ! Oh ! I 'll give you indigestion ! Charrid cowards couldn 't hit a pregnant lobboth at that dist ... Officer Sun ... What lucious lips ... ... amongst ... other things . Crichton was ... a lucky man . - Where is he ? - Gone . Gambled and lost . How unfortunate you must lose as well . SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

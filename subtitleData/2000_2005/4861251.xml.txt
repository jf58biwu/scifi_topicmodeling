 Sarge , Command says air support is holding until they can assess status . Status ? We need air support . tell them to get in here . That skiff is shredding us . MAN : They won 't move without a lieutenant 's authorization code , sir . Here 's your code . You 're Lieutenant Baker . congratulations on your promotion . Now , get me some air support ! pull back far enough to wedge them in here . - Get to high ground , pick them off . - Not with that skiff in the air . That 's our problem . Thanks for volunteering . Bendis ... ... give us some cover fire . We 're going duck hunting . You just focus ! The alliance said they were gonna waltz through Serenity valley . And we choked them with those words . We 've done the impossible , and that makes us mighty . Just a little longer , our angels will sow rain and fire on those arrogant cons ... ... so you hold . You hold ! Go ! - really think we can bring her down , sir ? - You even need to ask ? - Ready ? - always . Bendis . Bendis ! [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Yeah ! Zoe ! Nice cover fire . Did you see that ? Green , what 's our status on- - ? Zoe . Hey , listen to me . Bendis , look at me . Listen . We 're holding , no matter what . - We 're gonna die . - We 're not gonna die . We can 't die , Bendis . You know why ? Because we are so very pretty . We are just too pretty for God to let us die . Look at that chiseled jaw . Come on . If you won 't listen to me , listen to that . Those are our angels , blow the alliance to the hot place . - Zoe , tell the 82nd- - - They 're not coming . Command says it 's too hot . They 're pulling out . We 're to lay down arms . But , what 's- - ? MALCOLM : The vault 's sealed . Okay , I 'm gonna boil it . Jayne , give me the sticky . Okay , we get the goods , we 're off this wreck and back on the ship . No worries . Everything looks good from here . Yes . Yes . This is a fertile land and we will thrive . We will rule over all this land and we will call it ... ... " This Land . " I think we should call it your grave . Curse your sudden , but inevitable betrayal . Mine is an evil lair . Now die ! Oh ! No , God ! Dear God in heaven . [ ALARM SOUNDING ] Oh , motherly son of a- - full pressure . The goods must be intact . MALCOLM : Okay . Looking good . WASH : Captain , we got incoming . Alliance crews are bearing down on us . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] Have they spotted us ? - I can 't tell if- - - Have they hailed us ? If they want the salvage , we 're humped . ZOE : If they find us at all , we 're humped- - Wash , shut it down . Now . Everything but the air . KayIee . KayIee . Go to blackout , we 're being buzzed . Going dark . Okay , now I can 't get down . MAN 1 : So , what am I looking at ? A carrier , blew out a few months back . Lost all hands , but it was only run by a skeleton crew anyway . Damn shame . No point in checking for survivors ? MALCOLM : Wash , they slowing down ? - That 's a neg . Doesn 't look like they 're interested in us . We should be eating wake in a minute . Sir , there is a reading on that thing . Some residual heat . Do a sweep . [ BEEPING ] [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] - Captain , we 're humped . - Prep the ship , now . We move these in , double time . KayIee , fire it up . It 's a transport ship , firefly class . - They still make those ? - illegal salvage . LowIife vultures picking flesh off the dead . MAN 2 : should we deploy gunships and bring her in ? Do it . Cry , baby , cry . Make your mother sigh . Engaging the crybaby . Captain , I am picking up a distress signal 1 3 clicks ahead from a- - Sounds like a personnel carrier . definitely a big ship , sir . And she 's without power . Wash , we 're on . Go . Hang on , travelers . Let 's moon them . MAN 2 : They 're rabbiting . should we continue deployment ? Our gunships would never get back to us in time . Let 's go help these people . But put out a bulletin on the cortex and flag InterpoI . A firefly with possible stolen goods on board . Maybe somebody will step on those roaches . [ WASH SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] We look shiny , captain . They are not , repeat , not coming about . close one . JAYNE : Anyone you walk away from , right ? Long as we got the goods , I call this a win . Right . We win . well , there we are . - They 're awfully pretty . WASH : I 'd say worth a little risk . Yeah , that was some pretty risky sit you did there . Of course . Because they wouldn 't arrest me if we got boarded . I 'm just the pilot . I couId say I was flying the ship by accident . They 're pretty unreas- - [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] problem , sir ? CouIdn 't say . We best be getting rid of these before we run into another alliance patrol . What are they doing out this far , anyhow ? KAYLEE : Shining the light of civilization . How long until we reach Persephone ? - Three or four hours . - Can we shave that ? We 're down to the wire on fuel cells . We run hot , we might not even make it . play it close as you can . This cash is burning a hole in my hull . - Think that cruiser might 've ID 'd us ? - Let 's hope not . Contact Badger , tell him the job 's done . Don 't go to mentioning the cruiser , though . Keep it simple . - Sure there 's nothing wrong with the- - - It 's fine . Just want to get paid . Let 's get these crates stowed . I don 't want any tourists stumbling over them . We 're taking on passengers ? Yeah , that 's the notion . could use a little respectability on the way to Boros . Not to mention the money . - Pain in the ass . - No , it 's shiny . I Iike to meet new people . They 've got stories . Captain , can you stop her from being cheerful , please ? There 's no power in the ' verse that can stop KayIee from being cheerful . Sometimes you want to tape her mouth and ... ... dump her in the hole for a month . I Iove my captain . I know something ain 't right . Sweetie , we 're crooks . If everything were right we 'd be in jail . - It 's just that the captain 's so tense . - The man needs a break . In fact , we could all use a couple of days leave . We still gotta drop the goods . And when we do , we 'II fly off to Boros , rich and prosperous . well , less poor , but with enough to find some sweet little getaway . Oh , wouldn 't mind a real bath . And a meal that included some form of food . Just a couple of days lying around . You with the bathing . - Me with the watching you bathe . - If the captain says it 's all right . What if we just told MaI we need a couple of days instead of asking him ? - He 's the captain , Wash . - Right . I 'm just the husband . Look , I 'II ask him . Don 't forget to call him " sir . " He likes that . MALCOLM : Who likes what ? It 's nothing , sir . - Has the ambassador checked in yet ? - No . She had a pretty full docket . After you talk to Badger , tell her we may leave Persephone in a hurry . Inara has our timetable . She 'II check in . I couId tell her to cut it short . No , no . Don 't want to get in her way if we don 't have to . Somebody on this boat has to make an honest living . Oh , my God . INARA : Zenon isn 't that different from this planet . More crowded , obviously , and I guess more complicated . The Great City itself is ... . Pictures can 't capture it . It 's like an ocean of light . Is that where you studied to be a companion ? I was born there . I can 't imagine ever leaving . well , I wanted to see the universe . Do you really have to leave ? I mean ... ... my father is very influential . We could , I couId arrange for you to be ... . The experience has been more than ... . It was very good . - Thank you . - The time went too quickly . Your clock 's probably rigged to speed up and cheat us out of our fun . Serenity , this is shuttle 1 . What 's your ETA ? Inara , hey . We 're touching down at the Eavesdown docks ... - ... in about ten minutes . - I 'II join you there . Thanks . Looking forward to it . We missed you out here . Yeah , me too . This shouldn 't take too long . Best time for departure , in about three hours . Gravity supplies we 're low on , fuel her up . I 'd love to find a brand-new compression core for the steamer . I 'd Iike to be king of Ondinia . Just get us some passengers . Them as can pay . AII right ? - Compression core busts , we 're drifting . - Let 's not bust then . Zoe . [ SPEAKING GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] We will . You want a trip , Grandpa ? You need safe passage ? We 're cheap , we 're clean . Brutus , best ship in the ' verse . What 's your des , Grandpa ? - We 're hitting the outer rings . - I never married . What ? I 'm not a grandpa . Let me see your teeth . Yes . - You 're late . - You 're lying . What did you just say to me ? You 're aware we landed two hours before we planned ... ... with all the goods intact , ready to roll . It 's your decision to get touchy , say we 're late . Means you 're looking to put us on the defensive ... ... which means something 's gone wrong . Didn 't go wrong on our end . So why don 't we start again with you telling us what 's up . - You 're later than I 'd Iike . - well , I 'm sorry to hear that . If you 'd gotten here sooner ... ... you might have beaten the bulletin that came up saying : " Rogue vessel . classification , firefly . Was spotted pulling illegal salvage on a derelict transport . " - Didn 't ID us . Doesn 't lead to you . - No , it doesn 't . But a government stamp on every molecule of the cargo just maybe might . Oh , you noticed that . You were gonna hand over imprinted goods and let me twist ? - We didn 't pick the cargo . - And I didn 't flash my arse at the Iaw . There 's no deal . That ain 't fair . Crime and politics , little girl , the situation is always fluid . The only thing fluid I see here is the puddle of piss refusing to pay our wage . It doesn 't have to go this way . You know you can still unload those goods ... ... so I think something else is at work here . What were you in the war ? That big war you failed to win . You were a sergeant , yeah ? Sergeant MaIcoIm reynolds . balls and bayonets brigade . Big tough veteran . Now you got yourself a ship and you 're a captain . only I think you 're still a sergeant , see ? still a soldier . Man of honor in a den of thieves . well , this is my gorram den ... ... and I don 't like the way you look down on me . I 'm above you . Better than . Businessman , see ? Roots in the community . You 're just a scavenger . well , maybe I 'm not a fancy gentleman like you with your ... ... very fine hat ... ... but I do business . - We 're here for business . - Try one of the border planets . They 're a Iot more desperate there . Of course , they might kill you . But you stay here , and I just know the alliance will track you down . I have that feeling . wheel never stops turning , Badger . That only matters to the people on the rim . You 're gonna come with us . Excuse me ? You like ships . You don 't seem to be looking at the destinations . What you care about is the ships and mine 's the nicest . - She don 't look like much . - Oh , she 'II fool you . - You ever sail in a firefly ? - Long before you were crawling . Not an Aught 3 , though . It didn 't have the extenders . Tended to shake . So how come you don 't care where you 're going ? Because how you get there 's the worthier part . Are you a missionary ? I guess . I 'm a shepherd from the South Down Abbey . Book . I 'm called Book . Been out of the world for a spell . Like to walk it a while . Maybe bring the word to them that need it told . well , I 'm KayIee . And this here 's Serenity . And she 's the smoothest ride from here to Boros for anyone who can pay . Can you pay , or ... ? well , I got a little cash and ... . Ooh . Grandpa . I never married . I don 't understand why we didn 't leave him in a pool of his own blood . We 'd be dead . Can 't get paid if you 're dead . Can 't get paid if you crawl away like a little pug . I got a share of this job . Ten percent of nothing is- - Let me do the math . Nothing and then nothing ... . - So we find a buyer on Boros . - Boros is too big . The alliance could just be waiting for us . You think Badger would sell us to the Feds ? If he hasn 't already . If alliance catches us , we 'II lose the ship . - That 's never gonna happen . - Sir ... - ... we could just dump the cargo . - No way . We ain 't had a job in weeks . I didn 't sign on to take in the sights . We need coin- - Your mouth is talking . You might wanna look to that . - I 'm ready to stop when- - - You 're right , though . Last two jobs we had were weak tea . We got nothing saved . Taking on passengers won 't help near enough . We don 't get paid for this cargo , we don 't have enough money for fuel ... ... let alone keep and repair . We should be dead in the water . - So we do the border planets ? - I 'm thinking WhitefaII , talk to Patience . - We don 't want to deal with Patience . - Why not ? - She shot you . - well , yeah , she did a bit . StiII- - - So we find somebody else . Horowitz . - He can 't afford it . - holden Boys . - They wouldn 't touch it . I 'II go through the list . Capshaws are brain-bIown . Gruvick 's dead . - He 's dead ? - Town got hit by Reavers , burned it . I ain 't going near Reaver territory . Them peopIe- - WhitefaII is the safest and the closest . It 's a Iong time since Patience shot me ... ... and that was due to a legitimate conflict of interest . I got no grudge . She owns half that damn moon now . She could afford what we got and might need it . - I still don 't think the old lady 's the way . - I 'm not saying it won 't be tricky . We got no kind of choice . - welcome aboard , Mr ... . - Dobson . Just gotta keep our heads down , do the job , and pray there ain 't no surprises . please be careful with that . mal , this is Simon . Simon , this is our captain . Captain ReynoIds . welcome aboard . This all we got ? Now we have a boat full of citizens right on top of our stolen cargo . That 's a fun mix . Ain 't no way in the ' verse they could find that compartment , even- - Even if they were looking for it . Why not ? Because . Oh , yeah . This is gonna go great . If anyone gets nosy , you know , just shoot them . - Shoot them ? - politely . [ WASH SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] Inara , just in time . Let me guess , we 're in a hurry ? Looks like . Starboard hatch green for docking . Locked in five , four ... . The ambassador has returned . You got a full house , captain . KayIee , I 'm locking it up ! AII aboard . MALCOLM : Meals are taken up here in the dining area . Kitchen ' s self-explanatory . You 're welcome to eat what there is . Pretty standard fare , I guess . Protein in all the colors of the rainbow . We do have sit-down meals , next one being at about 1 800 . I think Shepherd Book has offered to help me prepare something . - You 're a shepherd ? - I thought the outfit gave it away . - Is it a problem ? - Of course not . - It 's no problem , because it 's not . - No . As I said , you 're welcome to visit the dining area anytime . Apart from that , I ask you to stay in the passenger dorm while we 're in the air . The bridge , engine room , cargo bay , are off-Iimits without an escort . Some of my personal effects are in the cargo bay . You all got luggage you need to get into . We 'II be happy to fetch them with you . Now , I have to tell you one other thing , and I apologize for the inconvenience . We 've been ordered by the alliance to drop medical supplies on WhitefaII . It 's the fourth moon on Athens . It 's out of our way ... ... but we 'II get you on Boros no more than a day off schedule . What medical supplies ? - I honestly didn 't ask . - probably plasma , insulin . Whatever they ain 't got enough of on the border moons . - alliance says " jump . " - AII right . - You wanna take them to the cargo bay ? - Yes , sir . MALCOLM : Anything else you need , just ask . We live to serve . - Did you send word to Patience ? - Ain 't heard back yet . - Didn 't she shoot you one time ? - Everybody 's making a fuss . Oops . I 'm sorry . Thank you . Ooh , ow . Ah ! The ambassador graces us with her presence . hello , mai . I see we have some new faces . - Hey , you . - Hey , you . MALCOLM : Ambassador , this is Shepherd Book . I 'd have to say this is the first time we 've had a preacher on board . well , I wasn 't expecting to see a state official , either . Ambassador . [ LAUGHS ] - I 'm missing something funny . - Not so funny . - " Ambassador " is mal 's way of saying- - - She 's a whore , Shepherd . - The term is " companion . " MALCOLM : I get those mixed up . - How 's business ? - None of yours . She is , pretty much , our ambassador . plenty of planets wouldn 't let you dock without a decent companion on board . This isn 't a problem for you , is it , Shepherd ? - well , I certainIy- - - It 's all right . I mostly keep to myself . When I 'm not whoring . Don 't you want to meet the rest of the bunch ? Why don 't you make sure they want to meet me first . So how many fell in love with you and wanted to take you away from all this ? Just the one . I think I 'm slipping . JAYNE : I 'm starving . - This is incredible . SIMON : It is great . - It 's not much . I had a garden at the abbey ... - ... thought I 'd bring what I couId . - It 's kind of you to share . It won 't last . They 're not the same frozen . - Pass the tomatoes . - The important thing is the spices . A man can live on packaged food from here until Judgment Day ... ... if he 's got enough rosemary . Captain , you mind if I say grace ? only if you say it out loud . So does it happen a Iot ? Government commandeering your ship , telling you where to go ? It 's what governments are for . Get in a man 's way . It 's good if the supplies are needed . We 're just happy to be doing good works . I hear a Iot of the border moons are in bad shape : pIagues and famine . Some of it is exaggerated and some of it ain 't . AII those moons , just like the central planets ... ... they 're as close to Earth as we can make them . Gravity , atmosphere , but- - Once they 're terraformed , they 'II dump settlers there with nothing ... ... but blankets , hatchets , maybe a herd . Some of them make it . Some of them ... . Then I guess it 's good we 're helping . You 're a doctor , right ? Oh , uh ... . Yes , I was a trauma surgeon on Osiris and capital City . Long way from here . You seem so young to be a doctor . Yeah . - You 're young to be a ship 's mechanic . KAYLEE : Know-how . Machine 's just got workings and they talk to me . That 's a rare gift . well , not Iike being a doctor . helping fix people , that 's important . KayIee here just wishes you was a gynecologist . [ LAUGHING ] Jayne , you will keep a civil tongue in that mouth or I will sew it shut . - Do we have an understanding ? - You don 't pay me to talk pretty . Just because KayIee gets lubed up over some big-city- - walk away from this table . Right now . What do you pay him for ? - What ? - I was just wondering what his job is . On the ship . public relations . [ KNOCKING ] [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] If I 'm intruding ... . Not at all . I expected you . I couldn 't really say the same . So would you Iike to lecture me on the wickedness of my ways ? I brought you some supper . But if you 'd prefer a lecture ... ... I have a few very catchy ones prepped . - Sin and hellfire . One has lepers . - I think I 'II pass . Thank you for this . The captain said you might like it . - I was surprised at his concern . - For a lowly whore ? It was unjust of him to say that . believe me , I 've called him worse . Anyway , I suspect he has more interest in making you uncomfortable than me . He 's not wildly interested in ingratiating himself with anyone . Yet he seems very protective of his crew . It 's odd . Why are you so fascinated by him ? Because he 's something of a mystery . Why are you ? Because so few men are . [ WASH SPEAKING OVER INTERCOM ] Mal , you might want to get up here . What is it ? A signal . Somebody hailed the nearest alliance cruiser . - tell me you scrambled it . - To hell . I don 't know how much got through . alliance got a pin in us for sure . [ SPEAKING GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] We got a mole on board . Forget your toothpaste ? - Are you out of your mind ? - Just about . - What did you tell them ? - tell who ? I got exactly no time for games . What do they know ? - You 're a lunatic . - And you 're a gorram Fed . I hate to say it , captain ... ... but you 've got the wrong man . - Son of a bitch . - Drop that firearm , Captain ReynoIds . This is not my best day ever . Simon Tam , you are bound by law to stand down . What ? The doctor ? Oh . Hey , is there a reward ? Get on the ground . - Get on the ground ! - Lawman , you are making a mistake . You best get on the ground . The man seems twitchy . I think everybody could stand to calm down a bit . - This isn 't your business , Shepherd . - The boy 's not going anywhere , Iawman . As I understand it , it 's pretty cold outside . No worry . Put Lord FauntIeroy here in one of the passenger cells . Get the hell away from that weapon ! You think I 'm a complete back-birth ? You 're carrying a fugitive across interplanetary borders . And you think I believe you 're bringing medical supplies to WhitefaII ? As far as I care , everyone on this ship is culpable . well , now ... - ... that has an effect on the landscape . - please . We 're close to true stupidity . A cruiser 's en route , so talk all you want . You got about 20 minutes . - Might have less than that . - Yeah , threaten me . - For God 's sake . - Think I won 't shoot a shepherd ? Back ! - Just take him . - Get the hell down ! - What is- - ? SHEPHERD : Stop it ! - What-- ? - KayIee ! SIMON : How do you feel ? - A little odd . MALCOLM : Be still . - Out of the way . - You 're not killing this man . - Not right away . - He 's no threat . - What did he- - ? - Oh , whoa . - That ain 't hardly a mosquito bite . - Big mosquito . - Move . - Not gonna happen . - I ain 't joking with you , preacher . ZOE : Jayne ! Just tie him up . Do it . KayIee , stay with me . Stay with me . Can you move your feet ? - Are you asking me to dance ? - She 's going into shock . INARA : KayIee , you have to focus . The gun , shepherd . please . [ SCREAMS ] - The infirmary working ? - Yeah , we got it stocked . WASH : We 've been hailed by a cruiser ordered to stay on course and dock for prisoner transfer . - Change course . Run . - hell with you . You brought this . I 'm dumping you with the Iaw . She 's dying . - You 're not gonna let her . - Yes , I am . - No . You can 't . - The Feds won 't let us walk . - We dump him in a shuttle . Leave him . - Everybody 's so mad . - It 's okay . - Know what that wound does ? - I surely do . - The next few minutes are crucial . You let her die , you 'II never make it to the Feds . She 'II still be dead . You rich kids think your lives are the only thing that matters . What 'd you do ? kill your folks for the family fortune ? - I don 't kill people . - Then do your job . - Turn this ship around . - Enough ! mal , do it . Don 't you ever tell me what to do- - [ CRYING ] Zoe , change course . help me get her up . Wash , change course and go for hard burn . We 're running . - You have an extractor ? - Got a laser saw . That 's not good enough . My room , red bag . When this is over , you and me will have a chat . Won 't that be fun . Dope her . Can 't do any more until she stabilizes . will she ? I can 't say yet . I want to know what 's going on here . - well , then , why don 't we find out . - No ! No ! Stay away from that . Where 's the Fed ? Secured . Shepherd 's with him . Seems to think he 's not safe alone with me . No . well , Iet 's see what a man like you would kill for . SIMON : No , don 't ! Huh . I need to check her vitals . - Is that what they call it ? - She 's not to wake . The shock- - The shock of what ? Waking up ? Finding out she 's been sold to some border world baron ? I 'm sorry , was this one for you ? Is it true love ? Because you do seem a IittIe- - [ SCREAMS ] River . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay , I 'm here . Simon . Simon , they talked to me . They want me to taIk- - They 're gone . They 're gone . They 're gone . We 're safe now . We 're safe . We 're safe . I 'm here . What the hell is this ? This is my sister . SIMON : I am very smart . I went to the best medic-ad on Osiris . Top three percent of my class . Finished my internship in eight months . Gifted is the term . So when I tell you that my little sister makes me look like an idiot child ... ... I want you to understand my full meaning . River was more than gifted . She was a gift . Everything she did : music , math , theoretical physics , even dance there was nothing that didn 't come as naturally to her as breathing does to us . And she could be a real brat about it too . I mean , she used to ... . There was a school ... ... a government-sponsored academy . We had never even heard of it , but it had the most exciting program . The most challenging . We could 've sent her anywhere , we had the money , but she wanted to go . She wanted to Iearn . She was 1 4 . I got a few letters at first , and then I didn 't hear for months . finally , I got a letter that made no sense . She talked about things that never happened . Jokes that we never ... . It was a code . It just said : " They 're hurting us . Get me out . " ZOE : How 'd you do it ? Money . And luck . For two years I couldn 't get near her . Then I was contacted by some men , some underground movement . They said that she was in danger ... ... that the government was playing with her brain . If I funded them , they 'd sneak her out , get her to Persephone ... ... and from there , I couId take her wherever . will she be all right ? I don 't know if she 'II be all right . I don 't know what they did to her . Or why . I just have to keep her safe . - That 's quite a story , son . - Yeah . It 's a tale of woe . Stirring . But in the meantime , you heaped a world of trouble on us- - - I never thought- - - I don 't imagine you thought . In consequence , we got a kidnapped Fed on board . We got the alliance on our trail . And KayIee- - - How much does the alliance know ? - Can 't say . I killed the message , so maybe just our position . Or they might have personal profiles on each of us . - till that Fed wakes up , we won 't know . - So , what do we do ? The job . I got word from Patience , she 's waiting for us . We circle around to WhitefaII , make the deal , get out . Keep flying . What about us ? KayIee comes through , you and your sister get off at WhitefaII . If she doesn 't come through ? Then you 're getting off a mite sooner . - That 'd be murder . - Boy made a decision . - He didn 't shoot her . - No , somebody else did ... ... and why ain 't we dealt with him ? - kill a Fed ? Can you think of a stupider- - - He can ID us all . - Throw me out . But River is not a part- - - Can we vote on the murdering issue ? We don 't vote on my ship . It 's not the town hall . - This is insanity . - I think we 're beyond that now , sir ! - We 'II talk this through , yeah ? - I 'II not sit by while there 's killing here . [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] The way it is is the way it is . We gotta deal with what 's in front of us . mal , you know those two wouldn 't survive a day in WhitefaII anyway . You throw them out , I 'm leaving too . It might be best you do . You ain 't a part of this business . What business is that , exactly ? I 'm a dead man . I can 't know ? Is it gold ? Drugs ? Pirate treasure ? What is it that makes you so afraid of the alliance ? You don 't want to go down this road with me , boy . Are you not afraid of them ? I already know you 'd sell me out to them for a pat on the head . hell , you should probably be working for them . You certainly fit the profiIe- - Saw that coming . I 'm in a tricky position . I guess you know . Got me a boatload of strange folk ... ... making my Iife a little more interesting than I generally like . Chief among them , an alliance mole who likes to shoot at girls when he 's nervous . I gotta know how close the alliance is ... ... exactly how much you told them before Wash scrambled your call . So ... ... I 've given Jayne here the job of finding out . He was non-specific as to how . You 're only gonna scare him . - Pain is scary . - Just do it right . Any idea how much trouble you 're in ? - Never been in trouble with the Iaw . - No , not Iike this . You think this is just a smuggling rap ? - The package that boy 's carrying- - - It 's a girl . She 's cute too . Except I don 't think she 's all there , you know ? - Of course , not all of her has to be . - She 's a precious commodity . They 'II come after her . Long after you bury me , they 'II be coming . I 'm not gonna kill you , Dobson . What 's your first name ? Lawrence . Lawrence , I 'm just gonna cut on you until you tell me how much they know . They know everything . Every name , every record , how many ... ... nose hairs you 've got . See , they don 't know a damn thing . It 's all over your face . I ain 't even- - I was gonna get me a ear too . Aren 't you an officer of the Iaw ? Don 't they teach you to withstand interrogation ? You can 't even tell a damn lie . Okay , I can see you 're not an idiot . Wish I couId say the same , Lawrence , but this is disappointing as hell . Let me speak a language you will understand : money . This girl is worth a Iot of money . I mean , a Iot . Now , you kill me , there 's nothing . But if you help me out ... ... you 'II have enough to buy your own ship . Better one than this piece of crap . Does helping you out mean turning on the captain ? Yes , it does . How the hell did they find us ? - It 's not alliance . - You sure ? - It 's a smaller vessel . - commercial ? - Yes . I read it as an older model Trans-U . - I didn 't think Trans-U still operated . They don 't . Get me visual . - They 're still too far out . - Get me something . I 'm picking up a Iot of radiation . They 're operating without core containment . That 's ... . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] That 's suicide . Reavers . Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God . [ MALCOLM SPEAKING OVER INTERCOM ] This is the captain . We 're passing another ship . Looks to be Reavers . In size , probably a raiding party . could be they 're headed somewhere particular . Could be they already hit someone and they 're full up , so everyone stay calm . If we try to run , they 'll have to chase us . It 's their way . We 're holding course . We should be passing them in a minute ... ... so we 'II see what they do . Zoe , you come on up to the bridge . - I don 't understand . - You never heard of Reavers ? Campfire stories . Men gone savage on the edge of space . KiIIing- - They 're not stories . What happens if they board us ? If they take the ship ... ... they 'II rape us to death , eat our flesh and sew our skins into their clothing . And if we 're very , very lucky , they 'II do it in that order . There 's a magnetic grappIer . - They get ahold of us with that . - tell me if they hold their course . They 're holding course . I guess they weren 't hungry . Didn 't expect to see them here . They 're pushing out further every year too . Getting awful crowded in my sky . KAYLEE : Hey , captain . Hey . hello , KayIee . What 's the news ? I 'm shiny , captain . A-Okay . I can 't feel much below my belly , though . It 's getting cold . well , you just gotta rest . Something will break down on this boat soon . Who else I got to fix it ? Don 't you worry none . Doc fixed me up pretty . He 's nice . Don 't go working too hard on that crush . Doc won 't be with us for long . You 're nice too . No , I 'm not . I 'm a mean old man . He wasn 't gonna let me die . He was just trying to ... . It 's nobody 's fault . Okay ? Just promise me you 're gonna remember that . I 'II keep it in mind . You are a nice man , captain . You 're always looking after us . You just gotta have faith in people . She 's a real beauty , isn 't she ? It 's a standard companion immunization package . - I 'm not sure it 'II heIp- - - It won 't hurt . - supplies down there are rudimentary . - Is there anything else I can do ? - I don 't think so , but I appreciate it . - KayIee 's very dear ... ... to all of us . I 'm sorry . For my part in what happened . I 've never ... . - I mean , I don 't know how to- - - You 're lost in the woods . We all are . Even the captain . The only difference is he likes it that way . No , the only difference is the woods are the only place I can see a clear path . - What 's your business here ? - It 's my business . The usual . I gave the boy a free thrust since he 's not long for this world . - What are you doing in my shuttle ? - It 's my shuttle . You rent it . Then when I 'm behind on the rent , you can enter unasked . I thought you were leaving , anyhow . well , I guess that depends on you . You ruin her , too , you know . This is the thing I see you 're uncomprehending on . Everyone on this ship ... ... even a legitimate businesswoman like her ... ... their lives can be snatched away because of that Fed . You got a solution for that ? You got a way around ? I don 't . Comes time , someone will have to deal with him . That should be you . But I don 't think you got the guts . And I know you don 't have the time . What do you mean ? KayIee 's dead . The man 's psychotic . You are psychotic . No , you should have seen his face . - I 'm a bad man . - And KayIee 's really okay ? Yeah . I didn 't expect her to heal this quick . Doctor knows his trade , I 'II give him that . - We 're being hailed . - That would be Patience . We 're close enough for vid , put her up . - Malcolm Reynolds ? - hello , Patience . I have to say , I didn ' t look to be hearing from you anytime soon . well , we may not have parted on the best of terms . I realize certain words were exchanged , also certain bullets . That 's air through the engine . It 's past . We 're business people . Your days of fighting over salvage are behind you . - What are you , mayor now ? - Just about . You telling the truth about that cargo ? Your asking price is a bit too reasonable for that much treasure . It 's imprinted , hence the discount . Government goods , huh ? If that doesn 't work for you , no harm- - Alliance don ' t scare me . Just collating data , as they say . I like that you 're up-front about it . We can deal . I left load coordinates for a rendezvous outside of town . See you in the world . I believe she 's planning to shoot me again . If she meant to pay , she 'd have haggled you down . Just a little effort to hide it wouId 've been- - - Sir , we don 't have to deal with her . - Yes , we do . Here 's a concept I been working on . Why don 't we shoot her first ? It is her turn . - Doesn 't get us what we need . - There 's moons here we ain 't seen . - We could try our Iuck- - - Our luck ? You notice anything particular about our luck these past few days ? Any kind of pattern ? You depend on luck , you end up on the drift . No fuel , no prospects ... ... begging for alliance make-work . Getting towed out to the scrap belt . That ain 't us . Not ever . Patience has got the money to pay and she will , one way or another . There 's obstacles in our path and we 'II deal with them one by one . We 'll get through this . We will . [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] - Nice place for an ambush . - That it is . Here you are . I buried them good . Equipment 's back on the boat . Testing . - Testing , captain . Can you hear me ? - I 'm right here . - You 're coming through good and loud . - Because I 'm right here . But the transmitter 's ... . Patience is gonna figure we buried the cargo ... ... which means putting us to our ease before there 's any action . She 'II come at us from the east ... ... talk the location out of us . She 'II have a coin to show us first . We get it , give the location ... ... snipers hit us from there and there . - You figure they 're in place yet ? - should be . feel like taking a walk around ? You don 't want to piss yourself and back down like you did with Badger ? walk soft . I want Patience thinking they 're still in place . Don 't kill anyone you don 't have to . We 're here to make a deal . Don 't think it 's a good spot , sir . She still has the advantage over us . Everyone always does . That 's what makes us special . Lawman . It 's Shepherd Book . I believe you 're in more danger- - [ GRUNTS ] Ah . mal . How you doing , boy ? walking and talking . Is that Zoe ? You still sailing with this old bum ? awful lot of men to haul three crates . well , I couldn 't be sure my mai here wouldn 't be looking for some payback . You understand . We 're just on the job , not interested in surprises . [ PUNCHING , GRUNTING ] I don 't see my cargo anywhere . You won 't , until I 'm holding 200 in platinum . Come on , ReynoIds . I 'm supposed to take it on faith that you got the goods ? MALCOLM : It 's pure , Patience . Genuine A-grade foodstuffs . Protein , vitamins , immunization supplements . One would feed a family for a month . - Longer if they don 't like their kids . - Yep , that 's the stuff . So where 's the rest ? Simon ? What 's wrong , sweetie ? Look at you , all woke up . Sorry about what happened before , but make a sound ... ... the next one goes through your throat . East half a mile , bottom of the first hill , you 'II see where it 's been dug . I reckon I will . well , then ... . Yep . I 'd appreciate it if you all turn around and ride out first . well , you see , there 's a kind of hitch . We both made out on this . Don 't complicate things . I got a rule . I never let go of money I don 't have to . Which is maybe why I 'm running this little world ... ... and you 're still on that dinky old boat sniffing for scraps . Got the money back . There 's no need for killing . - We 're just gonna walk away ? - That 's up to Patience here . - could be messy . - Not terribly . mal , you just ain 't very bright , are you ? That 's quite a rifle . Boy must be your best shot to carry that . He 's called Two-Fry . always makes it quick and clean . Two-Fry . Nice hat . You should ask the captain to drop you somewhere else . WhitefaII ain 't exactly civilization in the strictest sense . You don 't have to worry about me . Zoe 's out on a deal , I always worry . So ... ... it 's not out of my way . KAYLEE : He took her . He took River . [ ALARM SOUNDING ] Don 't . Don 't you dare . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] Zoe . Armor 's dented . You were right about this being a bad idea . - Thanks for saying . - MaI , don 't you take another step ! I did a job . Got nothing but trouble since , not to mention a few unkind words ... ... as regard to my character , so let me make this abundantly clear . I do the job ... ... and then I get paid . Go run your little world . mal ! It 's Wash ! We got ship coming in . They followed us ! The Reavers followed us . No , don 't ! Don 't move . WASH : Reavers ! Reavers incoming and heading straight for us . We are in the air in one minute . I guess they got hungry again . You can do that . You 're gonna kill a lawman in cold blood ? I know what you did for your sister . I understand . It doesn 't make you a killer . I don 't want to hurt anybody . I have a job to do . To uphold the Iaw , that 's what we 're talking about here . Come on , come on . Where the hell are you guys ? There 's nowhere you can take her the Iaw won 't find . Nobody is going to hurt her . - unless you hurt me . - No , I said ! I said , don 't move . It 's your call . [ HATCH OPENS ] I 'm not playing anymore . Anybody makes so much- - MALCOLM : Jayne ! Wash , we 're on ! [ CRYING ] How close are they ? - Twenty seconds from spitting distance . - Lose them . Give me vid . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] - How close do they need to be ? JAYNE : Come on , dodge them ! If everyone could be quiet a moment . - I need KayIee in the engine room . - Get her in there now . Get in your shuttle . Get the civilians ready to go . - I can 't just leave you here . - That was the plan . - MaI , don 't do this- - - We get boarded , take off . - We might be able to stop them . - They 'II kill you . Inara ... . Go . How we doing ? I don 't mean to alarm anybody ... ... but I think we 're being followed . You three , come with me . I think I can help KayIee out . - should I- - ? - Take her . Keep her safe . Can 't keep this up . They 're gonna lock us down . KayIee , how we doing ? Gonna need a little push here . You want me to go for full burn ? Not just yet , but set it up . You know where the press regulator is ? Head of the class . [ KAYLEE SPEAKING OVER INTERCOM ] We 're ready for full burn on your mark . full burn in atmo ? That won 't burn us out ? Even if it doesn 't , they can push just as hard , keep right on us . Wash , you gotta give me an Ivan . I 'II see what I can do . KayIee , how would you feel about pulling a Crazy Ivan ? always wanted to try one . Jayne , open the port jack control , cut the hydraulics . - Where the hell is- - ? - Look . Look where I 'm pointing . Okay . Now it 's real simple . - They 're on us . - KayIee . Come on , come on , come on . KAYLEE : Okay . Everybody hold on to something . Here 's something you can 't do . Now ! MALCOLM : I knew I hired you for something . Whoo ! Ain 't no way they can come around in time to follow us now . We 're good , people . We 're out of the woods . Whoo-hoo-hoo ! Yeah ! That 's my girl . That 's my good girl . We should have just enough left in us to hit a fuel station . We need to do some patching up . - I hope we got paid today . - We did . Sir , I 'd Iike you to take the helm , please . I need this man to tear all my clothes off . Work , work , work . - You should have the doctor look at this . - It 's not so bad . well , I 'm sure you 'II be fine . I didn 't say that . Is this what life is out here ? Sometimes . I 've been out of the abbey two days . I 've beaten a lawman senseless ... ... fallen in with criminals . I watched the captain shoot the man I swore to protect . And I 'm not even sure if I think it was wrong . Shepherd . I believe I just ... . I think I 'm on the wrong ship . Maybe . Or maybe you 're exactly where you ought to be . - The shot I gave you will help you sleep . - I slept for so long . Just a little while . And then we 'II find a place . We 'II find a safe place . I didn 't think you 'd come for me . well , you 're a dummy . JAYNE : The girl 's a problem . The lawman said they 'd keep looking for her . Something about her special brain . Important to the alliance brass . - Sooner we dump them two , the better . - Suppose so . Funny how the lawman got out of his room , you having tied him up and all . I didn 't have nothing to do with that . Anyhow , it all turned out just fine . Buzzards are the only ones gonna find him . But he did try to make a deal with you , right ? How come you didn 't turn on me , Jayne ? - Money wasn 't good enough . - What happens when it is ? well , that 'II be an interesting day . I imagine it will . You need me to look at that ? Just a graze . So where do you plan on dumping us ? Best place as you might be safe . The truth , though , you 're probably safer on the move . And we never stop moving . I 'm confused . No , wait , I think maybe you 're confused . It may be apparent to you that the ship could use a medic . You ain 't weak . Don 't know how bright you are , top three percent ... ... but you ain 't weak and that 's not nothing . You live by my rule , you keep your sister from doing anything crazy ... ... you could maybe find a place here . until you find a better . I 'm trying to put this as delicately as I can . How do I know you won 't kill me in my sleep ? You don 't know me , son , so let me explain this to you once . If I ever kill you , you 'II be awake . You 'II be facing me and you 'II be armed . Are you always this sentimental ? Had a good day . You had the alliance on you ... ... criminals and savages ... ... half the people on this ship have been shot or wounded , including yourself ... ... and you 're harboring known fugitives . We 're still flying . That 's not much . That 's enough . subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

 Bitch . Bartender , Seven and Seven , pack of Morleys . Seven and Seven , pack of Morleys . [ Laughs ] We have a winner . Do I know you ? Do you know me ? Come on , Wayno ... I 'm part of the regular game . You know your problem , my friend ? It 's not the cards . It 's playing the hand you were dealt . Plenty of guys get a bad deal . It 's all in what you do with it . You know what I 'm saying , partner ? You can think . Cards can 't . They just lie there . You 've got to make them work for you . Jack of hearts . 2,598,960 possible ... five-card hands . 1,277 flushes in any given suit . 1,098,240 ways to make two pairs ... and yet ... the game can 't beat a man . Man only beats himself ... and so on and so forth . She comes here every Friday ... and loses her paycheck ... cries all weekend . Such a nice girl . I keep hoping her luck is going to change ... she 'll catch a break . We going to blow this joint ? Call it a night ? Hey , Wayno . You 're bluffing me , right ? You 're going to show me Fifth Street . Walk right out of here ... surprise me for a change . Three of hearts ... two of clubs . [ Coins Clinking ] [ Laughing ] I won ! I won ! [ Woman ] Oh , my God ! Help me , please ! Help me ! Somebody , help me ! There 's a woman who 's been murdered ! Somebody help me ! Oh , God . She 's been murdered . Agent Reyes ? Three plus four is seven . Seven and six are 13 . What are you doing ? Ten , 13 , 14 , 16 ... I want to ask you to open your mind to something . I don 't want you to think I 'm crazy , all right ? Why would I think that you 're crazy ? Do you believe the universe is knowable ... as a mathematical calculation of the whole reducible to a single equation ? - No . - Why not ? Because I don 't think that its complexity ... allows for it to be reduced so simply . But you accept that some people do ? I presume you mean the so-called " Unified Theory ? " What physicists often refer to as the Theory of Everything ? An equation so simple they say that it might be printed on a T-shirt . It 's a Holy Grail in the world of science . Potentially , the most important question that mankind has ever asked . But that such a complex calculation is even possible ... is the subject of enormous controversy . Is that what you mean ? Um ... potentially . Carla Maria Carpenter , born 02-1-77 . Killed outside a nightclub two years ago . Her murder remains unsolved . Judy Ann Fuller ... born 03-21-69 . Killed at a mall two years ago . Unsolved . Julie Frances Gresham ... born 01-22-80 . Killed in her parked car last month . Unsolved . Agent Reyes , if there 's a connection ... that I 'm supposed to be seeing , I 'm not seeing it . And our latest victim ... Amy Sheridan Noffsberger ... born 04-4-77 . Killed two weeks ago in a casino . Police have yet to find her killer . Agent Reyes , am I to presume ... that you 've solved these unsolved murders ... by using some kind of numerical calculation ? Letters of names assigned values , added to birth dates ... reduced to the lowest common denominator . A , J , S , equal one . B , K , T ... Numerology , Agent Reyes ? You 're trying to solve these cases ... by using what is essentially a child 's game . It 's been in use since the sixth century B. C ... when Pythagoras determined that the world was built ... on the power and influence of numbers . And , uh , when exactly ... did you stumble upon it ? We did it as kids . I still do it . You meet people at a party ask them their birth date . It 's kind of an icebreaker . And as I was reading the story of this woman , I calculated she was a 14 ... what they call a karmic number ... an extremely significant numerological number . Prompting me to look at all of these other unsolved cases ... the victims of which also work out to have karmic numbers ... ten , thirteen , sixteen . So , in other words , you haven 't actually solved these cases . Maybe " cracked " is a better word . Without any other evidence to directly connect them ... circumstantial or forensic . What ? Can you enlarge this ? Can I see the rest of those photos ? What is it ? There 's a pattern in the bruising . Yeah ... all four of the victims have it . Three small circles . They might be from a ring ... that the killer wears . So you 're saying these cases are connected . That numerology may actually be driving the killer ... and that I 'm definitely not crazy . Or that maybe you 're both crazy . ? Luciole ? ? Qui brille dans le ciel de la nuit ? ? Tes yeux ... ? ? Illuminent mon existence ? ? Sans tes baisers ? ? Mon coeur ne vivrait pas ? ? Je suis à toi ? ? Ne m 'abandonne jamais ? ? Ponciana ? ? No me abandones nunca más ? ? Ponciana ? ? Inoubliable étreinte ? ? Ponciana ? ? Je vais chanter pour toi . ? [ Laughing ] [ Speaking Italian ] Bravo , bravo . Arrivederci . Arrivederci . Arrivederci . Wayno . Come stai ? Quit following me or you might ... find yourself dead real soon . Oh , come on , Wayno . That 's not your style . Doesn 't fit your pattern . Far be it from me to rat you out . Can 't show ' em what they can 't see . Now , two clowns , and a man with a crown . Want to try your luck , sailor ? The king runs but he can 't hide . How can you lose ? Kid stuff . There goes the neighborhood ... but Mr. Money lives right next door . You know there 's a secret to this game , Wayno ... and I 'm going to tell you what the secret is . Choose better . You got something to say to me , you say it . Son , I just did . Hello . Uh , there 's a clipboard over there ... with three forms on it . Fill out the top one , or all three ... if you want to unlock your most secret numbers ... for love , life and true personal happiness . I 'm not here for a personal chart . I 'm with the F.B.I. , investigating a series of deaths ... that seem to have a numerological connection . I give valuable insights to the living . The dead pretty much already know their future . These are murders . I 'm looking for your help in trying to solve them . You may overestimate the kind of work I 'm capable of here . My hope is in doing the victims complete numerology ... you 'll be able to draw a picture of the killer . I don 't think you understand . I run a little business here . People come to me if they want to improve their lives ... how to get rich , how to marry the man of their dreams . I mean , look around . If I could actually provide that kind of information ... I don 't have to draw you a picture . - You don 't believe in it ? - At best , it 's an art . I have established an undeniable ... numerological connection between the victims in all of these cases . If I found the killer I might prevent this happening again . [ Sighs ] Let me see what I can come up with . [ Phone ringing ] Monica Reyes . Monica , you 're not going to believe this . We found two more cases . Two more victims to add to this thing . Both with the same marks on their faces . Now , I knew you were good , but this ... this is career-launching . You better get back here . [ People Clapping ] Nice work . Well done . Well done . Thank you . By brilliantly tying these murder cases together ... VICAP is now working hard to develop a profile ... on the man we are officially calling the Triple Zero Killer . Through the identification of a pattern he leaves on his victims ... we have been able to connect ... six unsolved cases to one murderer . Including these two new cases . Agent Scully will act as a point person ... on the case forensics . That 's three recent killings and three from 1999 . The developing pattern now appears to be ... murders in threes on a serpentine trail ... up across the Eastern Seaboard . Agent Doggett will lead the task force and is ready to roll . Here 's what we don 't know . One , how he chooses his victims . Two , how the killer kills and three , if he 'll kill again soon ... or disappear as he did two years ago . He may have been incarcerated during those years . We may be looking for someone with a record . That 's an excellent observation . The killer is strong . He uses his fists as weapons . Brute force . He is angry , and he acts on impulse . Good . Important . Agent Reyes , we 're all working off your lead . Give us the benefit of your special insight into this case . Well , the killer probably has ... a Soul Number of either four or six . His Birth Path is ... I 'm guessing , a nine , or maybe a six . The Destiny and Realization numbers are definitely karmic . I 'll know for sure once I 've got ... the charts from the numerologist , but ... the killer is almost certainly working ... off numerical vibrational disharmonies . [ Phone Ringing ] That 's her now . Monica Reyes . Agent Reyes ? I 've been running numbers here on the murder victims . Yes , uh-huh . And the strangest thing has come up . What ? What is it ? Oh , there 's three forms in the clipboard . Fill out the top one , or all three if you want to unlock your most secret ... I want her body sent to Quantico . I want facts , I want details . I want Agent Scully ... - to go over this woman with a fine-tooth comb . - Yes , sir . And I want you , Agent Reyes , to tell me who else knows about this . - Knows about what ? - About this case . About you coming to this office to see this woman . I don 't think I told anyone . Then how did the killer find his way here ? Chance ? Coincidence ? I ... I ... We got a guy working the whole Eastern Seaboard murdering up and down the coast . Tell me how it is he winds up here in this city , in this building ... on this floor , in this room on the same day ... you came here to see her if he didn 't know . That 's actually why I came to see this woman ... to find out who the killer is ... why he does what he does when he does it . We have a reputation to uphold , Agent Reyes . The F.B.I. Doesn 't go to numerologists ... for the same reason we don 't consult horoscopes ... or palm readers or crystal balls . A killer kills for a reason . He lives in the world of cause and effect , as we all do . He gets an impulse and acts on it . Always the case , even if he doesn 't know it ... and that 's how we catch him . If he acts on impulses he can 't understand ... isn 't it possible we can 't understand them either ? Can we not accept that every killer is not ... driven by the same impulses and that there are some impulses ... that not every killer kills for ? No . Why not ? Because it 's unacceptable . But if Agent Reyes didn 't tell anyone she was coming here ... the only person who would possibly have any idea is somebody at the F.B.I. An inside job ? I don 't buy it . But don 't we at least have to accept that as a possibility ? No , we don 't . Why ? Because it 's highly improbable . But not impossible . Six of one , half a dozen of the other . How would you like us to proceed , sir ? The bottom line is I want results . I don 't care how you go about it . What I want is this killer caught . All right , let 's get the body out of here . Maybe you were followed . How ? If the killer didn 't even know I was looking for him ? I don 't know ... you explain it then . This woman called me just before she was murdered . She had something to tell me , something she found in the victims ' charts . Their charts ? Their numerology ... a calculation of numbers that rule their lives ... in 13 different categories . But a calculation based on what ? On names and birth dates . Because my name is John Jay Doggett ... and I was born April 4 , 1960 I got some kind of magic number ? Six . Which makes you an active , adaptive , curious person ... who insists on their independence ... loves a bargain and above all else wants to be successful . Well , that describes pretty much anyone . People are people . Right , they 're not numbers . Then what was she calling me for ? I 'm going to leave you here to figure that out . I 'm going back to the Bureau . [ Foreign Music Playing ] Buon giorno , Wayno . Who do you think you are ? Who do you think I am ? [ Radio Chatter ] Don 't say a word . Do I ever ? You 're just trying to get me caught . I 'm just playing a game of dominoes . As long as you 're sitting here , though . How are you feeling ? Go to hell . Are the reservations in your name ? You 're a card . You really are a card ... but I love you . - Got time for a quick game ? - I don 't play your games . Not a truer word 's been spoken . [ Foreign Music Playing ] The deceased is Vicki Louise Burdick . Upon external examination ... cause of death appears to be a fatal blow to the maxilla ... in which a small , three-ring pattern lies . I will begin my internal examination ... at 6 : 06 p.m. [ Recorder Clicks Off ] Agent Scully . I 've got something to show you . What is it ? I figured out what the triple-zero pattern on the victim is . They aren 't zeros at all . It 's the number 666 , only worn away . It must be stamped on the killer 's ring . 666 , the mark of the devil . Of course . How 'd you figure that ? I didn 't . Then how 'd you discover it ? Completely by accident . I discovered something , too ... the victims ' charts . When the numbers were figured ... the numerologist found they were a match to her own numbers . How did the killer find her ? It obviously wasn 't an accident . And how does that help us find the killer ? It doesn 't . [ " Inouois " Playing ] Agent Doggett ... I think we have a psychological profile on the murderer . What is it ? Based on the amalgam of forensic detail of facts ... such as time and place the murders were committed and the amount of force used ... we believe the killer is a man in his mid-20s to late 40s ... of average build and looks who is driven by rage ... stemming from a hatred of his mother from a very early age . He was a bed wetter who was made to feel inferior ... which he took out on the world by killing small animals . That 's it ? Go to work . That 's the average profile ... of almost every single serial killer ... the F.B.I. ' s ever hunted down . Is that really all that surprising ? Is there a problem , Agent Doggett ? It 's the way Agent Reyes found the cases . I don 't think she should so easily be dismissed . You don 't believe in this nonsense ? Look at this . The path of the killer forms a number six . Your point ? I don 't know . I just noticed it . Have you noticed all babies look like Winston Churchill ? Same difference , Agent Doggett . What if this is the killer 's pattern ? What if the number six ... has some kind of significance to the murders ? It may ... to you and Agent Reyes , but not to victim number seven . If we could analyze these numbers ... I know we could figure this out . Well , despite what we know about the victims ' numerology ... about the ring that we think that he wears we really know next to nothing ... about where to start looking for this man . The answer 's going to come to me . [ Bell Dings ] You going down ? [ Bell Dings ] Thank you . Get out of the elevator ! Move ! Just be cool . Be cool . All right ? Everything 's going to be fine . Be cool . It 's him . He 's going down . Stairs . [ " Torero " Playing ] [ Tires Screeching ] I 'm not getting reception . Great . " No service . " We have to get an APB out on that car . Did you happen to see a plate ? No . We got all the numbers on this case except for the ones we need . Maybe there 's another way out . Well , it 's only midnight . There 's got to be somebody coming in or out soon . How do we know who was driving that car ? That it was even him ? That 's the killer 's not still here ? We 're federal agents and we 're armed . If you are here and you make any sudden moves ... we will be forced to consider you a threat . [ Man Clears Throat ] Stay where you are ! Right there ! Hands where we can see them . Get out of the car slowly . Did I do something wrong ? Step around the back of the car . I want you to show us some identification . I don 't have a wallet . Do you have some form of I.D. ? I don 't think so . Sir , what are you doing here ? Waiting for a friend . At midnight in a parking garage ? We have this regular game we play . What kind of game ? Checkers . The checkers are ... in the trunk if either of you play . Sir , does it look like we 're here to play checkers ? No . What are you here for ? Get your hands back up in the air . Step forward . Put your hands on the trunk . He 's clean . All right . Let 's pop the trunk . What 's all this ? Music . You must really like music . Oh , I love it . The classics , of course . Mozart , Bach , the earlier jazz : Louis Armstrong Sinatra , doo-wop , Elvis ... - marching bands ... - Sir , enough . Don 't get me wrong . I love all music ... but I prefer the stuff that lasts . You like them ? Keep ' em . Thanks to the wondrous world of digital technology ... I can always make more . What time is your friend coming ? Soon . What do you want to do ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I have some nice dance music . We happen to be here , sir , because there is a serial killer on the loose . How many did he kill ? Seven women now . How are you going to catch him ? We 're not , stuck down here . You sure there 's nothing I can do ? Do you have the combination to the door ? No . Do you have a cell phone that works ? I wish I did . There 's always checkers . [ " El Bodeguero " playing ] Next victim ? How did we get ourselves into this ? [ Gunshots ] Cha-cha-cha ! Agent Reyes . [ Reyes ] Your hair color . I don 't believe it . What ? What if we 're his next victims ? You ? The seventh victim was a blond . But neither of you are blonds . He kills in threes . Blond , redhead , brunette . The next victims will be a redhead and a brunette . Amazing ... from a game of checkers . Who are you ? Obviously someone you are very lucky to have run into . No . No . You 're part of this . How do you figure that ? No , it 's all in the numbers . It makes perfect sense . The numbers led us to the killer ... the killer led us to the garage and now all we 've done is recognize ... the killer 's real serial pattern . So you 're saying I didn 't have anything to do with it . - Hey , keep your hands up . - Why ? I don 't know . - What 's this about numbers ? - Will you just ... I 'm very good with numbers . The killer is driven by an impulse we believe is numerological . Of course . He 's a serial killer . No , that 's not what she means . She thinks that his acts are determined ... by a calculation of numbers . So the killer 's not in control of his actions . The numbers are ? Yes . Well , are the numbers helping you catch him ... or are they helping him not get caught ? That 's a good question . So , it 's a kind of a game . No , it 's not . No , maybe it is . Maybe that 's what this is about ... who wins the game . I think she 's onto something . Agent Reyes , you can 't reduce a complex factor ... as physical and psychological into a game . You 're a scientist , Agent Scully . Your world is ruled by numbers : - Atoms , molecules , periodicity . - Wow ! And wouldn 't it follow that everything made from those things ... is ruled by numbers , too : Genes , chromosomes , us , the universe . Go , girl . Agent Reyes , that is utter nonsense , okay ? It would mean that all we are are checkers on a checkerboard ... being moved around by some forces ... completely outside and unbeknownst to us . - What did Einstein say ? - Einstein ... now there 's a winner . " God does not play dice with the universe . " Nor does he play checkers . Look , Agent Reyes , you can 't reduce all of life ... all creation , every piece of art ... architecture , music , literature ... into a game of win or lose . Why not ? Maybe the winners are those who play the game better . Those who see the patterns and connections ... like we 're doing right now . Free will . Maybe we 're not the next victims . Maybe we 're here because we saw the numbers and read the patterns ... and we 're here to catch the killer . But the killer is outside , killing ... and we are stuck in a parking garage . What if he 's not ? What if we didn 't look hard enough ? What if the killer 's still down here ? What are you looking at ? The same thing you are . So what now ? - You go left , - I 'll go right . You , you stay right where you are . Oh , there 's no getting rid of me . [ Muffled Grunting ] [ Muffled Grunting ] He 's going fast . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I think so . Can you hear me ? Why 'd you do it ... kill those women ? How did you ever find us ? I saw something in his pattern . It made me realize there 's going to be nine victims . Maybe you two were going to be eight and nine . Where 'd he go ? [ Mambo Playing ] [ Ringing ] Hello ? All right , I need to know . What ? What my numerology is , my number ... whatever you call it . What am I ? You 're a nine . Which means what ? Nine is completion . You 've evolved through the experiences ... of all the other numbers to a spiritual realization ... that this life is only part of a larger whole . Dana , are you there ? There 's something else that 's bugging me . What 's that ? Who was that man ? God knows . [ Festive Italian Song Playing ] ? Michelangelo ... telefono per tu ? - ? E chi è ? - ? E ' Carlito ? ?

 Hey ! Galactic Movers Make sure you spread out the newspaper . It won 't be good if we get paint everywhere . I 'm telling you , we should paint it with a brush . It 'll take too much time if we use a brush ! It 'll be over in a second if we spray it . I think you should do something about your do-or-die personality . Midori and Yukari are going to be here soon ! Then why did you promise them that ... Wow . A bookshelf ! You 're so lucky Futaba . You had someone to help you . Well , okay then ! Let 's get going ! See you Hajime ! Take care of the rest for me ! Off we go ! Yeah , yeah . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Record of the School Wars : MURYOU I looked up at the sky ...

Is this Futaba 's ? It 's great . Yeah , red fits her pretty well doesn 't it ? So , I guess it works . Muryou , would you like some barley tea ? Yeah , and we just got a package of sweets from dad . Brown sugar candy and sweet potato jelly . Then , I 'd love some . Konaya Snack-shop ICE We Have Ice Konaya Snack-shop ICE We Have Ice What did you want to talk about ? About Sanadon ... Again ? This is Sanadon from that incident . About the chip Subaru recovered ... What 's that ? It 'll serve as proof . I tried to figure out who programmed the order for Sanadon . There was a record of previous orders in this chip , and ... Did you figure it out ? No . Unfortunately I couldn 't decipher who it was . Just ... Just ? It 's not a planet that is affiliated with the Galactic Federation . According to the records , it was programmed with a system that none of the affiliated planets use . Non-affiliated planets ? Meaning , there are many planets that are after the power of Shingu . And what to make of this ... And about Captain Velosh and his crew , the Velunnians ' disposition ... What are you going to do with them ? First , they will be summoned by the Investigation Bureau as witnesses so we 're going to have them come to the Galactic Federation Headquarters . I see ... They 're having a going away party tonight . And the host is asking for our help ... Help ? Yeah ! This way ! Over here ! This way ! This way ! The new semester is going to be starting soon . Yes . You and I ... like this ... Um ... So ... What is it ? How many times ... have we hung out ... and talked like this ? This will be our third . That 's right ! Yes ! It 's the third time ! So um ... Well ... How um ... How do I say this ? Are you all right ? It 's okay . Stop crying . Seeing you ... um ... is well ... Let 's swim . Haru ... mi ... Not much has changed , has it Kyoichi ? H ... Hachiyou ! Y ... You ! Why are you dressed like that ? Ice Pops Ice Pops I 'm helping out my uncle . I 'm helping out my uncle . The swimming season is almost over , but the weather stays hot until September ... So ice cold stuff sells really well . Kyoichi , isn 't the sand hot ? Were you ... watching our ... um ... Date ? It 's your third time , right ? You were watching ? And you were counting ! ? Crepe Tsumoriya You were watching ? And you were counting ! ? Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya By the way , you 're wrong ! It 's not a date ! Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya I ... We 're just here to hang out ! Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya Isn 't that what you call a date ? Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya Figures you 'd say that . Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya I 'm sure that 's why Harumi is hanging out with you . Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya What do you mean , " that 's why " ? Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya Now , now ... Oh ! It 's almost time ! Crepe Tsumoriya Crepe Tsumoriya Where are you going ? Where are you going ? I have club activities . See you later , Harumi ! Wait Hachiyou ! I 'm on a date ! Sorry ! Got it ? I got it ! I got it ! Hot ! Hwot ! Hot-ta ! Hot ! Hwot ! Hwot ! Hot ! Hot-ta-ta ! Hot ! Hwot ! What 's his deal ? He 's burning up ! Let 's burn it up too ! Alrighty ! Hwot ! Hwot ! Hwot ! Hwot ! Moriyama Peaceful , peaceful ... It 's so peaceful ! Haa ! It 's a festival . It 's a festival . Dokoi Dokoi . It 's the shrine ! It 's the shrine . Yoitona ! It 's a festival . It 's a festival . Dokoi Dokoi . It 's the shrine ! It 's the shrine . Yoitona ! It 's a festival . It 's a festival . Dokoi Dokoi . It 's the shrine ! It 's the shrine . Yoitona ! It 's a festival . It 's a festival . Dokoi Dokoi . Your turn , Murata ... Right . Now that we 've finished the opening ceremony , I 'd like to start the first meeting of the Festival Club . In the end , I guess we got tricked into it . Yeah , tell me about it . But why isn 't Toshio here ? Isn 't he the one of the ones who started this Festival Club ? There 's nothing he can do . He said he 's going to be travelling all of August . Lucky him . America ... Summer in Japan is the best . Come on ... Now , a word from the Student Body President . I 'd rather not be called President during club activities . Then a word from our senior , Tsumori . Everyone . Thank you for letting me join in on the Festival Club 's activities . I , as well as Narita and Kawamori , have joined this club because of its objectives . It was more like they kept nagging at the two of us until we joined . Nagging is fine with me . You never know what 's going to happen in a festival at first , but I think the general idea of it is to go because it 's happening and to take part because it looks like fun . Well , that should be enough for the formalities ... I 'm going to sing a song . Yay yay ! This is the one I 've been saving to sing . The beginning verse . Well then everyone ... Shut up ! Well then everyone ... Shut up ! Oh , hey Nayuta ! What do you mean , " Oh , hey Nayuta ? " H ... Hey . Were you sleeping ? Where did that come from suddenly ? Because you have towel marks on your cheeks . No way ! Muryou , you have really good eyesight . You also have drool marks on the edges of your mouth . Anyway ! Don 't have such shady meetings in front of people 's houses ! It 's not shady , right ? That 's right , Nayuta . It 's absolutely fitting to have a Festival Club meeting at a shrine . So there you have it ... We 're sorry we woke you up . Whatever ! Whatever ! That made me look like I went to complain because they woke me up from my nap ! Isn 't that what it was ? Well , yeah that 's exactly what it was , but ... Ah ! You have towel marks on your cheeks ! You 're lying ! I 'm lying . Pardon me ! Hey , come on ! But I don 't think you had to leave because of it . I hate everything that has do with that festival . I don 't even want to listen to the songs ! But every year you 're in the festival . You dance in a priestess outfit . That 's my job ! I have to do that because I was born into the Moriyama family . What 's so wrong with it ? Festivals are fun . Everyone says that because they don 't know the real meaning of the festival . Really ? It 's a festival that chooses children who have to fight aliens . I hate it . You know too , right ? The real meaning of the festival ... The festival is an excuse to pick out children who could potentionally have the power . The chosen children are ... When I become stronger , I plan to tell grandmother ... That we should discontinue the incantation and the Child Dance . The Shingu transformation needs to end with my generation ! You don 't like it so you don 't want other people to go through it . That 's so cool ! Please don 'tjoke . Well , putting that aside ... As long as you 're here , I might as well ask you to be a witness . A witness ? Here he comes ! You 're late . Revenge ! Record of the School Wars : MURYO U Confident aren 't we , eating an ice pop ? That overconfidence will be the death of you . Oooh ! Listen to you brag ! What are you guys going to do ? I guess it 's a rematch race , right ? A race ? Last time , when we went to my hometown I 'm sure you learned a lot of things too , but Shun got a major training session from me ! Ahh ! The adventures of a single summer ! It wasn 't sweet , nor tender ... It was actually quite upsetting . So , that 's why we 're having a rematch . I see ... Nayuta . Will you say , " ready , go " ? Go ? We 're going to do the " Northern Tip of Japan and Back " course ! Bring it on . You can use any short cut , but make sure you stop at Cape Soya . Nayuta ! Sit tight . I 'll bring back goodies . Ready ... Go - Jeez , everyone 's so inconsiderate ... The power of the Stars ... The power of Shingu ... The body will become a new vessel ... You are yourself , but you 're not . Entrust and surrender your body to the tide . Remember the feeling when you transform into the Shingu . You are yourself , but you 're not . Entrust and surrender your body to the tide . Remember the feeling when you transform into the Shingu . You will proceed to the next stage . From your body to the new vessel ... When the new vessel becomes your own ... What does that mean ? Then , you will realize the true power of Shingu ... The true meaning behind the power of Shingu ... The true power ? The true meaning ? Nayuta . Nayuta . Nayuta . Are you all right ? Oh , yes , I 'm fine . Friend 's Park Ramen Set Yoshida Store Cheers ! Cheers ! We really could have met when the semester started , but ... Once school starts we 'll see each other everyday , like it or not so ... Then , why did we have the initiation ceremony today ? The Yoshida Store only makes oden during summer vacation . Right around now is when the broth gets mighty tasty . Might as well go all-out for an initiation ceremony . So Murata , did you plan this out ? Of course not ! It 's just that old lady at the store gives you a bonus if you go buy something with four or more people so ... You dragged us in so you could get a bonus ? Well maybe . You hear that ? He used us as an excuse , Atsushi . That 's good ! Food is an important part of a balanced diet ! Just kidding ! Look at you guys , with your oden ! Hello . Hey , have you seen Weinul ? Weinul ? Oh the other ... Is something wrong ? He went to go get some stuff and he hasn 't come home yet . I asked people to help out , but without the food ... it 's kind of hard . You are judging a race ? Yes . Everyone is so inconsiderate ! I learn something new every day on this planet . The technological level here , compared to Planet Zaigle is ... Please do not be offended , but it is significantly behind . But , there are a lot of people who have mysterious powers like you . Oh ... On top of that , our battleship Jilton ... You destroyed Sanadon . Is this planet really undeveloped , or is it advanced ? They 're coming . Aaand ... First place ! Keep the river clean Cape Soya Proof of Arrival Cape Soya Proof of Arrival Cape Soya Proof of Arrival I thought we were head to head . I thought we were head to head . I didn 't know she even bought goodies . That 's just depressing ... I always buy something when I go someplace I 've never been . Oh ! But you were faster than last time . You must have been training . Good ! Good ! Setsuna , you really weren 'tjoking when you said you were a fast runner . You took pictures and even bought goodies . Yeah , well . Is she Muryou 's sister ? Yes , she is . You must be Mr. Zaiglian . My name is Weinul . Ah ! Perfect timing . You look like you 're grocery shopping . Would you want to buy these off of me ? I was so lucky to stumble across this in the afternoon , I just had to buy it ! I have dried mackerel too ! I lost , and I have no regrets . I could care less , but I 'm surprised you had enough money to buy all this ! Yes ! That 's exactly it ! I got carried away and bought it , and now my wallet is in a pinch ! So will you please buy this ? No thank you . I finished buying groceries already . Oh , come on ! The monthly food money I receive from Jiltosh is not much . It is my duty to minimize unexpected spending as much as possible . Never mind Jiltosh ! See ? Don 't they look yummy ? No thank you . Even aliens have tough times ... I 'm having tough times too , you know ! All right ! Sold ! Jiltosh , but ... Weinul , I 'm using our emergency funds because today , we 're having a going away party ! Thank you for the invitation . Welcome ... But the host is missing . I 'm sure he 'll be back soon , so if you can hang around , that 'd be great . We came for the party because he told us " the more the merrier , " but ... Well gee , if Jiltosh said that , then no problem . I don 't care . Hey , what kind of a party is this ? Who knows ? But it 's an interesting gathering . True . Is this " hwot " thing a new fad ? Hey Kyoichi ! Why don 't you join us ? Hey you guys ! Woohoo ! Woohoo . What are you guys doing ? Having a party . How is this a party ? Cool it , Kyoichi . The mouth-watering food will arrive any minute , and the fun party will begin ... I think ... What do you mean , " You think ? " I can hardly wait . That 's not the point ! I 'm back ! Sorry to keep you waiting ! You 're late , Jiltosh ! Where did everyone come from ? Good thing we got extra food ! Kyoichi , why are you here ? Shut up ! I got dragged into it ! Umm ... You know , would it be a good idea if we moved the party to the beach ? Ooh ! Good idea ! Hajime , what are you doing ? Partying . Partying ? Yeah , starting now ! Want to join us ? Yeah ! Yeah ! Huh ? Another party ? This time it 's a going away party ! Weinul 's friends are going back to their country . Oh . Hajime will be there too . Can I go ? Sure . But take a shower before you go . And ... I 'll wear my dress . Yes , yes ... To a safe journey for Weinul 's friends ! Cheers ! It 's great to have so many reasons to celebrate in one day ! Hachiyou , are you sure we can use this place ? Yes . I got permission from my uncle . Plus , we have water here , so ... For a minute there , I was wondering if this was ever going to happen . Now , now ... Anything is possible , if you try . That 's rather careless planning . Well , you know ... Here you go . You can 't butter me up ! Then how about this ? Forgiven ! Watch this . Leaving you behind seems like the right decision . Yes . You must witness what is about to happen , and consider it . Yes , Captain . " I 'm on a date ! " Hwot ! Hwot ! Hwot ! Hwot ! Hwot ! Hwot !

I have something to show you . Feast your eyes on this ! It 's beautiful ! And huge ! Can I touch it ? What is it , already ? It 's a single atom of Jumbonium . An element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $ 50,000 . - How much more ? - 100,000 . That 's why I hid it under my mattress . Can we discuss this somewhere else ? Why certainly . The atom sits atop this dime-store tiara to be awarded to the winner of the Miss Universe Pageant . Your job is to deliver it , safe and sound . When I was a little girl , I dreamed of being Miss Universe . That 's pathetic . Deep down , all girls wanna be Miss Universe . - Not me . - Really ? Maybe it 's just cute girls . The atom 's value would bankrupt Planet Express , if it were stolen . We 'll need to hire additional security for the mission . Mister Professor , right here ! We should stick with people we know . - Flexo 's great , but ... - Flexo 's great ? That 's good enough for me . Welcome aboard , lad . Space bandidos are operating nearby .

Bender , then Flexo , then Fry . Flexo outranks me ? That 's " Flexo outranks me , sir ! " - Who goes there ? - Don 't point that at me . I know Flexo 's your friend , but I don 't trust him . Just because he has a beard you label him as evil ? I 've got a label for you , an ugly word called " prejudice . " - I 'm not prejudiced . - Save it for the cross burning , Adolf ! - Keeping an eye on the safe ? - You know it ! Looks like it 's my shift . Lie down and go off-line for a while . All right . Caught you ! You were looking at the atom . So ? I look at lots of atoms . - Shouldn 't you rest up for your shift ? - You 'd like me to fall asleep . Whatever it takes to shut your yapper . I 'm just kidding you . Here 's a joke : I 'm gonna sit here until my shift . - Suit yourself , skinbag . - I will . - Good ! - Good ! Good ! That 's eight hours . Eight hours of solid boredom . I 'm kidding . You 're a wonderful man . Finally , the atom is safe . What is it ? My God ! Did you hear maracas ? - No . - It wasn 't space bandidos . Lock the ship . - Don 't let Flexo escape . - Aye , aye . It appears Flexo has outwitted us all . Especially me Bender . How did he steal the atom ? By using a sleep ray . Sleep rays exist , right ? - No . - Then I fell asleep . You were sure right about Flexo . The ship 's locked . He may have escaped . Thanks , Bender . Let 's look for him . I 've got a map of the ship right here . Keep an eye on Fry . It 's possible that he did it . Searching ... Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants ? He wasn 't here 10 minutes ago , so I thought I 'd check again . Well , he wasn 't in the kitchen room . Bender , can I hold that map for a second ? And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt ? No way . Give it up ! All right , take it ! Looks like Flexo got away clean . It 's a darn shame . He must have jumped ship just as we landed . Or maybe he never left at all ! Wait . You 're Bender . Who said I wasn 't ? Why were you wearing a scarf , a turtleneck and this ? It 's a little thing called style . Look it up sometime . Our ninth finalist , Miss Methane Planet Halatina Smogmeyer . And our tenth and final finalist , Miss Earth 's Moon the Crush-A-Nator . Thank you , Bob Barker . I 'm as happy as a girl can be . End statement . Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara ? Downplay the tiara . We 'll find out after these subliminal messages . You lost the atom , huh ? You 're garbage ! Human garbage ! Do you space jockeys have any idea how much it 's worth ? - $ 100,000 ? - $ 200,000 ? - $ 200,001 ? - You 're closest without going over . We 'll leave . Just sign , saying you received the atom . I 'm not signing squat . Find me that damn tiara . - But , Mr. Barker ... - Enough ! I may be against the fur industry , but I 'll skin you alive ! As long as no one wears the skin . Well , gentlemen , it appears we 're boned . - Flexo ! - Get him ! Next , in what is generously called the talent competition performing a traditional gangster rap , Miss ... What the ... ? Got you ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! - Shoot him , he 's choking me ! - No . Shoot him , he 's choking me ! - I don 't know which one to shoot ! - Shoot Flexo ! Women only room ! All right , enough of this ! There 's the atom ! Bender ? You stole the atom ? Yeah , but I can explain : It 's very valuable . I saw him snatch it while Fry slept . That 's why I ran to tell Bob Barker . Wait a second . Bender is the evil Bender ? I am shocked ! Shocked ! Well , not that shocked . I 'm sorry we suspected you , Flexo . But with the beard ... Don 't even bother ! You people sicken me ! I put my life on the line . This is how you repay me ? You can go rot for all I care ! I 'm just kidding . You guys are all right . I 'm so confused . The Bender I like is evil , and the Bender I hate is good . How can I live my life and not tell good from evil ? They 're both fine choices . Whatever floats your boat . - Is this the guy ? - Huh ? Yeah . It looks like him . - Wait , but I ... - Take him away . Let 's put an end to this pathetic hoedown . Brannigan ? And the winner is ... Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic , degrading ... Leela ? Wait , you 're making a ... Look at that ! I feel like a princess ! Are you people idiots ? I 'm still going mano a mano with this envelope . And the winner is Miss Vega 4 ! There it is Miss Universe There it is looking Weird I almost had that tiara . Me too . You guys are losers but I made out with the woman from the Radiator Planet . Fry , that 's a radiator . Is there a burn ward nearby ? Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

 This place draws quite a crowd . It means the water can 't be too bad . Yeah it 's the only bar in town . I guess we scared off the regulars . If it 's us or them , I vote for us . More Raptors huh ? At least seven or eight not too long ago . Well let 's hope they 've gone somewhere to sleep it off . I 'll get the others . It 's like polished glass . A couple of months ago , this place must have been ... pounding with crystal clear water . Stop it , you 're making me thirsty . Hey remember , whatever water we have has ... to last until we find another source so . Then why don 't we just head back to the tree house ? Because I think we 're close to finding a way off the plateau . These rocks are from an earlier geological period then the surrounding territory . Which means ? If there is a rift in the valley that leads off the plateau ... then this is where it 's likely to be . Roxton ! - Any luck ? - Yeah ... we found a watering hole . A place a girl can get a decent martini ? If you like them very dry ... small , brackish and frequented by raptors . That 's charming . At least we can tank up enough to keep looking . How is it ? It 's not the best but it hasn 't killed me yet . Heads up everybody , we 've got company . This way . They 're on both sides ! Back against the wall ! At the dawn of the last century ... A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world ... Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story . They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Any bright ideas ? Yeah , learn to fly . Somebody get up top and give me some cover ! Hurry up ! Come on Roxton ! Thanks Malone . My name is Ana Pizarro it is a pleasure to meet you . Ned , Ned Malone . The pleasure , Miss Pizarro , is all mine . Ned I hate to interrupt but ... could you ask Miss Pizarro if she 's got anything to drink ? Yes ... it appears we missed last call downstairs . There is just a trickle , I am afraid . Follow me . When exactly did your ancestors leave Spain ? In the year of our Lord fifteen hundred and four . And was it an official expedition ? So many questions , Señor Malone , you exhaust me . I 'll make you a deal . Help me get back to my pueblo ... and I 'll show you the way my ancestors got here from the Amazon . So you do know a way off ? Where there is a way in there is a way out . See ? I told you Malone the way off the ... plateau would be in this part of the world . That 's great , that 's amazing . Yeah , took the words right out of my mouth . But I will need your assistance though . Help me get home and I will show you the route . - When do we start ? - Now please . Yes this spring attracts far too many predators . Lead the way . - Allow me . - Thank you . I can 't wait to taste the sweet revenge ... when the Zoological Society has to eat its bitter words . I can see it now , it will be a victory for you to savor . How about you Malone , will you relish the fame of being a chronicler of the Lost World ? I hope to publish a few articles . A few articles ! Malone you gotta think big , I see books , lecture tours , tea with the King . Oh , we will join those immortal few ... who have witnessed and recorded history . Our work will survive long after we 've gone . We must stop now . There 's still enough daylight left . We should stop when we lose the sun . No , no , no I must pray . We can continue after but I must pray now . Señor Malone would you like to keep watch ? Ah , Of course . Ah the ever-chivalrous Ned Malone . You don 't want her out in the jungle alone do you ? She is your ticket out of here . I must cleanse myself in preparation for my prayers . Horse bones . Looks like they were all dumped here . They were , by horsemen . - Horsemen ? - More like warriors ... very fierce , very territorial . We 're on their land . and they don 't exactly welcome visitors . This is not from a horse . It 's a ceremonial cup made from a human skull . They use it to drink the blood of their enemies . I hate to see what they use for brandy snifters . This isn 't a joke Roxton , look around you . This is a horsemen 's killing ground . And they don 't take very many prisoners if you know what I mean . There are a lot of rough folks on this plateau . They 're the last you 'd pick as neighbors . Miss Pizarro ... you think she 's lying about her pueblo ? I think she 's lying about everything . Where exactly are we going ? Another two days walk through the valley . Is that how you came here ? No , we can 't get back that way . This is horsemen territory and you 're leading us straight into the heart of it ? That 's were my home is . They wouldn 't let outsiders live here . Not for four days let alone four hundred years . Our pueblo is in the steep cliffs . We 're very well protected and we have no grazing areas so they leave us alone . We 're not well protected here . Don 't worry ... the horsemen are taking their horses to the higher meadows for water . We can get through without being seen . You know what they do to their enemies ? What ? Drag them from the back of their ponies ... until their legs fall off or they die . If the route off wasn 't a risk we would have found it long ago . We 're nearly halfway there , let 's keep going . All this talk , we must move . You see what I see ? We better warn the others . Challenger ! Challenger ! What is it ? A horsemen scouting party not far behind . We must move quickly . Four men on horseback , we 'll never outrun them . Well maybe they have not yet seen us ? We 're not that lucky . - We 'll make for the jungle . - We 'll never get there in time . We must do something . We 'll make our stand here , check your weapons . What do you want ? Give us the witch . Friend of yours ? That 's not funny . She stole our water . We 're all a bit dry but if you 're thirsty we 'll spot you a pint . She stole the water from our parents now she steals it from us . What 's he talking about ? Are you accusing Ana of causing the drought ? She must die so the rain will come . Give it to us and you can go . And if we don 't ? You will all die . I had a funny feeling he 'd say that . They will kill me . We 're just passing through , we don 't want to fight . All who travel with the witch have died . We can wait for you to die too . Then we 'll kill her . Well that was too easy . Where do you think they 're going ? To get reinforcements . They don 't like you very much , do they ? Like you said , the horsemen do not like trespassers . What did he mean by you stole the water from their families ? They are superstitious . Our pueblo is near a river which is their main water source . Every time there is a drought they blame us . So what do we do ? Well if we 're all agreed we won 't give Ana up . We 've only three choices . Now we can turn around and go home . - If they let us . - True enough . We can stay here and die of thirst ... or we can get to Ana 's pueblo before the horsemen get us . We must move now . Run ! Take cover ! They 're riderless ! It 's just a decoy ! Hold your fire for the real attack ! Ana ! Go . Everyone all right ? Yeah . Thank you Ned , you saved my life . If it wasn 't for Veronica I wouldn 't have been around to do it . Then I 'm forever in your debt Veronica I hope I find a chance to repay you . Thanks , it 's okay . Ana 's friends will no doubt be back . Well let 's keep moving . That was a stupid thing you did back there , you could have been killed . Good throw . Next time I might not be around . You don 't know anything about Ana . Neither do you . Why do you dislike her so much ? I don 't trust her , she 's up to something . Why , why do you say that ? Her story doesn 't add up . Really ? Well who do you think she is ? I don 't have all the answers ... but if you weren 't so infatuated with her ... What ! Why else are you following her around with your tongue hanging out ? Maybe you 're just jealous because I 'm ... paying attention to Ana and not you . I 'm concerned , I 'm not jealous . I appreciate your concern but ... I can take care of myself . You 've never been off the plateau ? Not even for supplies or to visit relatives ? I have lived here my whole life . And you know nothing of Europe or the outside world ? Just stories that have been passed down of ... Isabella and Ferdinand and Columbus . The automobile ? The airplane ? What are these things ? Aren 't you curious ? No . But why not ? Have you ever heard of Menendez Pelayo ? - The Illuminati ? - Who ? Spanish mystics who believe they can communicate ... with God in private ... find him in themselves . Yes , well we still believe that . - You 're descended from them ? - Yes after they were convicted of heresy by the Inquisition ... we had to flee Spain under threat of death . And they ended up on the plateau ? Searching for their own utopia , a new Eden . Ah , it 's a pity they got stuck here . Wait ! No , no this was beyond their deepest prayers . They found a home . If we leave here we will be killed . By whom ? In Spain people who believe what ... we believe are burned at the stake . Ana ... things have changed a little bit in the last four hundred years . We don 't burn people for their religious beliefs anymore . It 's the twentieth century . Hmm , this may be so , but if there is one think I have learned in my life ... people mistrust the unfamiliar . Veronica , give the girl some privacy . Here let me give you a hand ... Oh no thank you , I don 't want to be any trouble . No trouble , it will give us a chance to get to know each other . Thank you . You and I have a lot in common you know . - Really ? - Yes , we both grew up on the plateau ... both about the same age . We 're both alone . What a remarkable series of coincidences . Yeah , I 'll say , so how do you explain the fact that I 've never heard of you , or your people ? What exactly are you troubled by ? I don 't like you giving my friend Malone so much grief . Malone seems grief-stricken to you ? I think he 's old enough to decide these things himself . It is good ? It 'll do . And me , will I do ? I want to thank you for saving my life . But Ana , you , you 've already done that . If there is anyway I can repay you . You 're first watch Ned . Between horsemen and wild beasties , you 'll want to keep your wits about you . There 's something I don 't understand . You seem to like me yet . are you afraid of me señor Malone ? It 's complicated . Only if you make it that way . Life is a wonderful gift , except when you are lonely then mere hours seem like an eternity . Don 't spend the rest of your life alone Ned . I 've got to go keep watch . If you feel like leaving this life instead of ... waiting for the next let me know , huh ? Any sign of our friends ? I heard a couple of raptors but no sign of the horsemen . Oh you know , sometimes I ... think it might be nice to be back in civilized society ... where dying of boredom is the most constant danger . Do you think that world even remembers us anymore ? You 're thinking of that girl you left behind . I thought you realized you didn 't belong in that world anymore . What choice do I have ? Everyone must all think we 're dead by now . You always have a choice . Even if Gladys is still waiting for me ... I 'm not the same man who left . If you 're asking my advice I 'd say ... what do you really want . I have seen the way Ana looks at you . Ah , she 's just grateful . How youth is wasted on the young . You know if I was your age on the ... adventure of a lifetime with a beautiful woman like that looking at me . I know what I 'd be doing . Still , you 're a writer Ned not a doer . - That 's not true . - Of course ... the world will be a richer place for you having ... sat on the sidelines and recorded your observations . Great , put that on my gravestone . He was a writer not a doer . Nooo ! Ana ! - Malone ? - What happened ? - She ... - Are you alright ? I am fine . Her face it was ... it was old . You were ... it was ... ancient . Calm down Malone . I saw it ! Do not worry , you have not gone mad Ned . How did you do that ? Your eyes have not deceived you . Friends , I am afraid I have been less than truthful . That 's the first honest thing she 's said so far . I am not descended from the Spanish explorers who ... came here four hundred years ago . I am a survivor of that expedition . I think I liked it better when you were lying . We came in search of and found ... Ponce de León 's fountain of youth . That 's ridiculous . Well maybe not Veronica . The discovery was hinted at in ancient Spanish texts . Oh it exists , I assure you . The fountain is in a cave on the other side of the valley . For centuries the horsemen had been kept at bay , but ... the drought has made them desperate . As were we , we went in search of drinking water , they killed the rest of the search party . You don 't really expect us to believe this ... story ? I could believe it . I saw it . She washed her face and it ... Here let me show you , I have not yet finished bathing . I 'll take a gallon to go . I escaped with just the elixir I am carrying . I must get back to the fountain otherwise I will die . Help me make it to the fountain , I will ... give you the gift of eternal youth . Of course ... and what about the way off the plateau ? All tunnels from the plateau were buried in lava long ago . So there is no way off ? There is just the plateau ... and the fountain of youth . Ponce de León 's fountain of youth . Time to get going . To where exactly ? Well , the fountain of course ! If it exists . You must believe me . I am sorry Ned . Veronica was right , I didn 't know who you were . But I am just as I appear . Once we get to the fountain we need never have to change . Roxton , talk sense to them . She showed us the proof . We saw it with our own eyes . Maybe it 's a trick of some sort , maybe there is something in the water . Yes ! Exactly , something that makes you young again . It 's not worth the risk . Why don 't I drop by in say twenty years ... time and see how you feel then ? Eternal youth won 't do you any good ... when the horsemen are sipping from your skull . Well the horsemen seemed to have moved off away from us . It 's true . And it is just a half a day . Seems like too good a chance to miss . Coming Ned ? Another story of a lifetime . Bring back a bottle for me . I 'm going back to the treehouse with Veronica . Huh , your short life . So tell me Marguerite eternal youth ? - Won 't it get boring ? - ha A question only a man could ask . And why is that ? Because men get more valuable with age . Hmmm , and women ? And women , for every year ... every wrinkle drops your stock a little lower . Oh , is it really all that bad ? Don 't you know anything ? I mean , take our little Ana here . When Malone thought she was 22 years old he was all over her . Now she 's just another washed up four hundred year old ... where 's sweet Ned ? Wait up ! I don 't need your protection . I know that . Tell me ... you weren 't the least bit interested in the fountain of youth ? All right . I 'm not the least bit interested in the fountain of youth . Did you see Ana ? She 's a slave to the water of the fountain . Just like an opium addict . It 's not exactly the same . Are you sorry you 're not going with her , because it 's fine with me . No , she said she was one thing ... she turned out to be something else . You saw just what you wanted to see . Maybe I did . So the only reason you 're not going is because you 're in a snit ? It 's not the only reason . Oh ? What if Challenger 's right . What if I 'm a watcher not a doer . - Well that 's a choice , right ? - That 's right what 's the point of living forever if you 're ... going to be a non-participant ? Aren 't you afraid of growing old ? What 's wrong with growing up ? If you 're going to come with me stay close , move fast and be quiet . We just might get past the horsemen without being killed . What is it ? Raptors I think , been following close the last hour or so . What the hell are raptors doing trailing us ? Do you think they can smell our water ? More likely they smell dinner . We have not far to go . The fountain is in a cave half way up this mountain . Then let 's go . Raptors can 't chase us up the mountain . Forget raptors , looks like our friends haven 't given up after all . Come on ! Give us the witch . Over there ! If they want the water witch , let 's just give her to them ! Look out Marguerite ! - Ah ! - Challenger ! Roxton , it 's deep . Marguerite ! We 've got to get him out of here , he won 't survive the battle . Ana , come here ! Would you slow down . What 's the rush ? What 's wrong Malone , growing old ? At this pace we 'll be back to the treehouse before you know it . What 's wrong with that ? How is he ? It is not good . It 's nicked the anterior tibial artery . I won 't last long . Oh no old boy , you 're not checking out on us now . We 'll think of something . You better think fast . He 's out again . Hang in there old boy ... we 'll fix you up as good as new . We must keep moving . The horsemen will not ... be slowed down for long . - Ana 's right . - And it 'll kill Challenger to move . - Oh my God . - There is one thing . Did you see that ? It 's sealed the wound . Your water will heal him ? If I have enough , yes . It will repair the tissues , reverse the damages ... of age and yes heal the wound . I can give him the rest but I must get to the cave . I cannot survive with the water from the fountain . Save him . We 'll get you to your cave . Well , now what ? That is all there is left . Then we 'll carry him to the fountain . Put me down ! I don 't believe it . My wound ... it 's healed . How did you do this ? The water ? From your fountain ? The last of it . Oh ! thank you . I ... why ... I don 't have the words . Please , just get me to the fountain immediately . Yes ! Yes , of course ! That water is the greatest scientific discovery of our age . It will transform the world . To tell you the truth it is not ... the world I am concerned about right now . Then let 's go , together we will make history . Well come on Marguerite , we can 't afford to lose our fearless leaders . I have never felt more alive . How old did he say he was again ? Well , he didn 't . The rheumatism in my shoulder is gone . Imagine millions of cranky old people ... running around trying to make up for lost time . Imagine never growing old at all . I get tired just thinking about it . How long have you got ? We must hurry Challenger . You used all your water to save me ? I will get you to that fountain on time . Look out ! I wonder what set that off ? Come on . Without my bath I 'm afraid I 'm not a very pretty sight . Will you make it ? I hope so . Horsemen above us . - How many ? - Three , four , I don 't know . Is there a way around ? There are sheer cliffs on either side . We don 't have to go around . What do you suggest ? We go straight through them . Yeah , right , you and whose army ? I don 't need an army . Where is he going ? Now he 's got the gift of eternal youth , he 's off to get himself killed . Come on ! Welcome to Christmas . And a happy new year . I did it ! The way is clear . Ana . We are going to make it . I think we found it . Come on , soon we 'll both be young again forever . There it is ... the cave to the fountain of youth . Here it is . Oh , can you hear it ? What a beautiful sound . We have done it . Thank you , Challenger . Ana ? From dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return . Where is the witch ? Turned to dust . - Give us back the water . - There is no water . Rain . See , she was a witch . Whatever she was she certainly had your number . I 'm not the only one . Marguerite wanted to bottle the fountain of youth and sell it . Well , I still think it 's a good idea . Why don 't you ask Challenger ? He 's ... the only one who got to benefit from the fountain of youth . Oh really ? She gave you some of her water ? Ana ? Only to heal my leg . She saved my life . And you were young again ? Oh yes . And able to take advantage of your newfound youth ? Oh yes . So how was it ? You should have been there . It didn 't last long . What 's the matter Challenger , your leg ? Oh , the Rheumatism in my shoulder is playing up again . So it was better when you were younger ? Better ... it 's hard to say . Older sure hurts more . *

 Anything ? Nothing . Thanks . There 's no sign of her on any of Moya 's sensors . Course , we can 't see more than 300 metras in this stuff . It 's thicker than pea soup . Pilot : Crichton , Moya 's never traveled in a stellar mist as compressed as this . I 'm having trouble accelerating and navigating . Perhaps Aeryn 's experiencing similar difficulties out there in the Transport Pod . D 'Argo : Let 's hope that 's all it is , Pilot . Stark ? Stark , is that you ? I never thought we 'd see you again . I was meditating . When did you come aboard ? Almost two solar days ago . I finally returned the Transport Pod you lent me after we escaped from the Gammak Base . I 'm glad you woke . I must talk to you privately. I have something important to tell you . Rygel : Hmm ... What are you doing out here , Zhaan ? I thought you were locked in your chamber , meditating . I was , but I woke early from my time with the goddess . Aeryn went out into that and we haven 't heard from her since . Perhaps you sensed the danger and that 's what woke you . How long 's she been gone ? One solar day . I thought we 'd hide in this fog or whatever it is from the Peacekeepers . Aeryn went on long-range recon and she hasn 't come back yet . No signal from her ? Nothing . ( communications beep ) Aeryn : Moya , is that you ? Aeryn ! - Aeryn ? Where the hezmana have you been ? D 'Argo , I 'll come on board now , if that 's all right . Yeah , we 've been looking for you . Aeryn ? Aeryn ? Pilot , I 've lost the transmission . I 'm locked on her position but some kind of opening is forming in the mist . I can see a planet below us now . Rygel : What did Aeryn do to it ? Chiana : Frell . Rygel : Looks like she 's been in some kind of battle . Chiana : I told you . I told you she shouldn 't have gone out in the mist . D 'Argo : Why isn 't she coming out ? D 'Argo ... Whoa . What the hell ? This is Zaccumleaf . Yeah , so ? I gave Aeryn a plant before ... before I started my meditation . She said she was suffering from head pains . Uh , chewing Zaccumleaf provides a potent neuralgesic effect . You don 't think maybe this is overkill for a headache ? Well , no . No , the plant I gave her was this tiny . Blue , over here . Hey . ( gasps ) John . John , you have to get out of here . You have to get out now . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . How long ... how long have I been here ? Not long , maybe an arn . An arn ? - Yes . The mist . The opening. it goes . I have to go back to the planet . My granddaughter 's waiting for me ... - Aeryn , now just sit back down . Ennixx can 't survive without my Transport Pod . - Aeryn , shh . There 's no other way off the planet . No , I ... no ! I only came back to warn you to get out of the mist as soon as possible , while you still can . Aeryn , Aeryn ... - No . Stop it , stop it . You cannot have a family . A granddaughter . You 've only been gone for one solar day . One day ? Yes . - Hmm ... Look , you 're wearing the locket , the locket that Chiana gave you . The one that says , " sorry I smashed your Prowler . " The one she stole from the last Commerce Planet we were on . She stole it ? Yes . - She told me she bought it . Well , that 's Chi . Look , if I 've only been gone one solar day then why am I so old ? Why-why ... why everything I 've lived , my memories , everything ... Aeryn , we don 't know . We 're trying to find that out . Maybe ... maybe your mind created the memories to compensate for your body getting old . Look at you . I 'd forgotten how beautiful you were . You 're so young . I 'd also forgotten how wrong you could be . If I 've only been away for one solar day how did this locket here get so old ? Aeryn , it 's an antique locket . I don 't care what any of you say . I have lived for 165 cycles . I have had three sons and watched them die and I have a granddaughter ... Aeryn , stop . - who will die if I don 't get to her . Aeryn , Aeryn . May I ? - Please . Stop , stop it . Stop it , stop it . - No ... please . No , no . Get your hands away from me ! ( sobbing ) Stark : There . ( Aeryn sobbing ) Take my thoughts . There . Can you feel it ? Mm-hmm . Shh . Thank you . Zhaan . Do you have any idea what 's happened to her ? Not as yet . I know it is Aeryn . Same DNA , same blood composition , same scars . By my best calculation , she has aged 160 cycles . In one day ? I 've heard of rapid aging , but nothing this fast . is it reversible ? It 's unlikely . Crichton : Pilot . Yes ? Have you got anything yet ? I 've been analyzing the stellar mist . It seems to be contracting more , but Moya 's sensors don 't find any toxins in it that might have caused Aeryn to age like this . Have you analyzed the planet ? - Yes . Its atmosphere is acidic and barely life-sustainable . Could Aeryn have survived there for 160 cycles ? No . She wouldn 't have survived one . Would you look at this frelling place ? Fascinating . What are we doing here ? We 're just seeing if Aeryn came back with anything . But why ? She 's only been gone a solar day . You don 't believe that other yotz , do you ? No , but she still might have come back with something interesting . Are you going to steal it ? Of course not . ( laughs ) : You 're worse than me . I like that . What are you doing in here ? Nothing . We 're looking for clues , to see if we can find out how this terrible , terrible thing happened to Aeryn . Chiana . Yeah ? There 's no dignity in what you are doing . Zhaan would like someone to look after Aeryn . Would you do that , please ? Well , you know Aeryn . Why don 't you watch her ? Chiana ... Oh , frell ! I don 't see why it 's always gotta be me . I mean , why do you always get the girls ... Just do it ! She may be dying . ( coughing ) - Hey , I didn 't mean to wake you . Hi , Chiana . ( coughs ) Would you help me sit up ? Sure . ( coughing ) ls that okay ? Mm-hmm . Hey . There 's some water over there . ( gasps ) I 'm sorry . Don 't make a sound , Chiana . No , no , no . Shh ... I 'm sorry , Chiana . That 's it , that 's it . I 'm sorry . It 's just I don 't have much time and neither do you . Shh . Aeryn . What happened to you ? I lived , Pilot . If you don 't believe me , you still must convince the others to stay out of the mist . I 'm glad I got a chance to see you one last time , my friend . What do you mean ? I 'll see you again . No , you won 't . Good-bye . Pilot , you let her leave ? She asked me not to alert you . You 're all free to come and go . Are you certain this mist is harmless ? It seems to be , yes . And if I go down to the planet , I 'm not going to age 200 cycles , right ? Moya has not sensed anything on the planet to cause the accelerated aging we observed in Aeryn . John , we do not know what made Aeryn grow old . She will die if I don 't go . I 'm going to go get her , pick her up , bring her back . I 'll be on the surface 30 microts , max . Worst case scenario , I age a couple years . Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! I 've come to take you back to Moya ! Go back before it 's too late . I 'm not leaving without you . Aeryn , look around you . is this where you lived for the last 160 cycles ? You could not have lived here . I didn 't live here . I lived on another planet . Another place . Aeryn , there 's nobody here . No one . There 's nothing . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Now , please , just go . Aeryn , no . Come back with me to Moya . Oh , stop it . Don 't . Aeryn , whoa . Put the rifle down , now . You touch my grandmother again and I will kill you . Wait a minute , you 're Aeryn 's granddaughter ? Of course . Who the frell are you ? I 'm John Crichton . You 're Crichton ? Yeah . Huh . She wasn 't making it all up . You 're real . All her life Grandmother 's talked about you . About a ... a ship . Moya . Yeah . Everyone , my father , her own son thought she was crazy . She kept returning to this Bulla forsaken hellhole every cycle , checking to see if you 'd come back . She 's only been gone for one solar day . A day ? I 'm 24 cycles old . I 'm her granddaughter . Well , I saw her yesterday . ( Aeryn coughs ) lt 's all right , Nana . No . I 'm here . John ? Go . Leave . No , I came to take you back . But the opening only lasts for four arns. lt goes away . You have to go now . I 'm not gonna leave you ! I 'm trying to save you . If you don 't go , you 'll get trapped for 55 cycles , trapped like I was . Aeryn , what the hell is going on ? Crichton , go back to Moya . If you want to , come back in eight arns when the opening reappears . Come back down and you will find me then , but you must go now , or you will be trapped . Eight arns ! Be here ! How 's your head ? Like I 've been kicked by a sistik . Why did Aeryn spike me ? Chiana ... I didn 't want to embarrass you in front of Rygel on the Transport Pod , but ... You could never embarrass me . Maybe not . But you 're one of us now . There 's no need for you to act like you 're not . D 'Argo , I always do what I want , okay ? I don 't know why . It 's just the way I am . I understand that , but ... Yeah , but you 're not going to change me . I 'm only just beginning to realize that . You 're pretty straight , huh ? Yes , I am . We 're not going to make it ... are we ? D 'Argo , you 'd better get up here . John 's on his way back . Aeryn was telling the truth , or part of it . She had some kind of life down there . I met her granddaughter . Granddaughter ? Yeah . She said that they had to stay . She had to get back through the opening in the mist before it ... Whoa ! Man , you guys feel that up there ? Pilot : Crichton , Moya 's sensors indicate that the opening in the mist seems to be closing . Estimated time to the hole , 15 microts . Man , holding this thing together is a bitch . John , you 're breaking up . ( transmission static ) Crichton , the planet is disappearing from Moya 's sensors . Pilot , what 's happening ? I don 't think the Transport Pod will be able to survive entry . John , you have to break entry . Break entry now . No , it 's okay. I can hold this thing together . John . John , can you hear me ? Pilot , what 's happening ? Pilot ! I can make it , I can make it , I can make it . Entering the mist ... now . Pilot ? Pilot ? D 'Argo ? Are you in prayer for Crichton ? Yes . And Aeryn . Zhaan ... I 've thought of something we might try to attempt to discover what 's happened to them . Tell me . An Ancient named Galik theorized about what he called Center Halos . He believed that scattered throughout the universe were mists where all dimensions met , and where time ceased to exist . What ? Do you think that Moya is caught in one of these Center Halos ? I thought ... if you and I joined spirits ... Joined with you ? What would that do ? I 've been told that Delvians , during a mind link , can sense the time continuum . Yes , that is what we strive for , but ... but few have achieved it . I thought maybe , together , we could catch a glimpse and see if there 's a void in the time continuum around Moya , see if no time exists in the mist . But , if I join spirits with you your mind might overpower mine . It is possible . Like so . I will lead you . ( energy field crackles ) Pilot : Zhaan ! What just happened ? Moya 's readings just went all over the scale and then everything froze . I couldn 't move . Did you feel it ? Yes , Pilot . We felt it . What happened to him , Nana ? Oh , Crichton . He was happy for a few cycles there , too . Something must have reminded him , thank you , of his past . I still think about it , sometimes . Moya . You 've never been as sad as him . Well , perhaps I hide it better . Will he ever be over it ? I 've done all I can . We took him from the barren planet , showed him our favored world . I know , you 've tried . We 've all tried , but Crichton was always stubborn . Why are those from the Outside always so unhappy ? Because we weren 't born here . This is your home , not ours . Give Crichton a few more cycles . He 'll come around . You can rack off . I 'm gonna to do what I wanna do . No , Crichton , no . I need the wormhole knowledge that you have locked in your brain . That 's great , Scorpy . You ain 't never gonna get that . I 'm dying. I 'm dying right here on this planet . And you ain 't never gonna get what 's in my head . Still talking to those visions ? - Loser . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , he 's bitching again . Oh , he 's gone . Bastard . I wonder if he 's still looking for me . Oh , well . Stark has developed a theory . He believes it 's possible that Aeryn was telling the truth . She has , in fact , lived for 160 cycles . How ? - Ah , yotz . Have you been drinking fellip juice ? Now , when Zhaan and I joined an arn ago , did any of you experience anything unusual ? Oh Yeah . That was you guys ? And Rygel , did you experience anything ? My throne sled stopped . I froze in midair for a microt . And you were still conscious ? Absolutely . Stark believes that Moya is trapped in what is known as a Center Halo , where time does not exist at all . We believe that when we joined for a moment , we all experienced this absence of time in the mist . You see , it 's possible that Aeryn aged normally down there on the planet . So it 's us ? It 's us who are not growing old . Yes . I don 't believe it . You 've got to be frellingwith me . So this means everyone we know , Crais , Scorpius , my son , they 're all old now ? Yes. lt is believed that nothing ages in a Halo , and eventually it hardens . And everything inside it is trapped without time , forever . Pilot says the mist is hardening now . Stark : Yes . Well then , let 's go . Let 's get out of here ! Pilot , how long until the planet is due to reappear ? If what Aeryn outlined still holds , the opening will reform in the mist in less than one arn . ( Crichton singing ) I 'll go no more a-rovin ' with you fair maid . A-rovin ' , a-rovin ' , since roving 's been my ru-i-in I 'll go no more a-rovin' These have grown . Yes . It seems like yesterday when we planted them . Yeah . ( grunts ) How 's your knee ? Oh , it 's fine . Just chasing beautiful women up and down the hills . A-huh . Well , why don 't you come and sit down here old man , or you 'll give yourself a heart attack . Don 't ... don 't ... don 't you " old man " me , woman . You 're 200 cycles older than I am . ( chuckles ) ( groans ) Ennixx and that sleeping pill she married have arrived . He 's not that bad . He 's boring . Just like everything else around here , bor-ing . Well , I warned you . I tried to make you go back . I know you did . John , I gave up being who I was , what I was , 100 cycles ago . Why haven 't you ? 'Cause I ain 't a gardener . I never wanted to be one . That 's all we do around here . Garden . Plant things . I was a pilot , Aeryn . Astronaut . I was what I wanted to be . I ain 't gonna forget that , and I can 't accept this . Do you regret this ? What ? Spending the last 55 cycles here with me . Aeryn , you are the one thing which has kept me from doing a kamikaze in the Transporter . I just have to try to get back to my old life , just for a day . That 's the hope . Hope , that 's what keeps me going . All right . Just don 't be too disappointed if it doesn 't happen . If you can 't ... ( groaning ) - You okay ? Yes , I 'm fine. I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It 's just the same old pain , same pain . Okay . Let 's , uh , get you back to the house . You can lie down . Come on . ( locket jingling ) Oh , no , no , no. I got it. I got it . - Give me that . Give it to me . - l got your locket . Whose , uh , image you got in here anyway ? You know who 's in there . Your husband ? He 's been dead 90 cycles . Why would you have his image in there ? Oh , just to drive you crazy . You know what I think ? - What ? I don 't think it 's him in there . I think you 've got my picture . Don 't flatter yourself . Yeah ! Yeah , my picture . Surrounded by roses and hearts and yotz . Open it , then . What ? Take a look inside . You 'll see his image . The only love of my life . No . No , I don 't wanna see his ugly face . Come on . Let 's get you back to the house . He wasn 't ugly , you know . Yeah , you keep talking about him and you can walk down by yourself . Hell , you can roll down the hill . ( chuckling ) Pilot , are you picking up any transmissions ? There 's nothing . ( rattling metal ) 50 cycles I 've kept this thing sealed up . Hope it works . ( electronic beep ) Pilot , can you hear me ? ( laughing ) Been waiting to say that for 50 damn years . Feels good . Pilot ! Can you hear me ? ! Why are you going ? Pilot ? ! Stay with us . - Pilot ! Look , come back to the favored planet and I will take care of you . The mist is dangerous ... - Ennixx , listen to me . I grew up a Peacekeeper . We are born in space , and we must die in space . But what about ... ? - Now I have spent most of my life down here with you , and it has been glorious . But when I die , I belong up there . Goodbye , Nana . Good girl . Now , go . Before I change my mind . Pilot ? ! ( device beeps ) Pilot ! ( static crackles ) Nothing ! I 'm not getting anything ! Wait . Something 's happening . The opening in the mist , I can see it forming . ( Comms beeping ) John , Aeryn , can you hear us ? ( static crackles ) John ? ( static crackles ) John ? ! Aah , maybe this thing 's bust . Maybe Moya decided not to wait for us . No . Pilot , can you hear me ? ! Pilot , anybody ? Pick up the damn phone , you useless pieces of ... ( static crackles ) We hear you . Ho ! Ah ! Ho ! Ho ! Ah ! Hello , D 'Argo ! Hey , hey , listen to this ! D 'Argo ! It 's me , John ! John , are you all right ? Can you make it back to Moya or you want us down there ? Oh , no , no , it 's all right ! We can get back up to you . We will come back up ! Right away ! ( laughs ) They waited ! Oh , ho , ho , ho ! Oh ! They waited . Yes , they did . Come on . ( groans ) Aeryn , baby , you all right ? I 'm all right. I 'm fine . Let 's get back to Moya . Going home . Going home . John ? ( faintly ) : I ... I ... I tri-l tried to get back here before , uh ... She was old , weak ... You , uh ... She , uh ... She died ... on the way . She 's gone . Aer ... Aeryn 's gone . ( crying ) The opening is on some kind of inter-dimensional orbit . It appears in the mist over the barren planet every 55 cycles . Do you know how to get us out of the mist ? Well , you could go back down to where l was . Well , then let 's do it . Let 's go down there . Oh , there ain 't nothin ' down there , Chiana . Just a few planets , a small colony of people . I searched it from end to end . There just isn 't anything there . It still sounds better than being stuck up here forever . Yeah , maybe . But I have had a lot of time to think . I believe that if we can get out of the mist at the exact point that we entered it , I might be able to get my life back . It might be an arn later , maybe 200 cycles later but I ... But how do we get back to that exact point where we entered ? Uh ... ( clears throat ) I might have an answer for that . I 'm not sure but I think we just have to go backwards . What do you mean , Pilot ? Since we 've entered it , I think the mist has been moving with us . I think the back of Moya is still right at the edge of the mist . Then go for it . Just back up . I 've been trying to but I can 't . The mist has hardened so much in the last arn , Moya can no longer move . You mean , we 're stuck . I 'm afraid so . Have you tried Starburst ? A Leviathan is not structurally designed for a reverse Starburst . It could destroy us . Pilot , just do a small jump and get us back to where we started . No . If we 're going to try and Starburst out , I think we should go forward down to the planet , not backwards . is that what you want ? You want that ? You wanna live your life on that planet ? A place where you 'll never see anyone you know ever again . ( sighs ) I have done that . And let me assure you , whatever the risk , it is worth getting your life back . I 'm with John . I do not want to live a life without a past . I want to see my son again . Me , too . I never wanted to go into the mist anyway . I guess I 'm in agreement as well . Goddess be with us all . Pilot , start initiating the sequence for reverse Starburst . John ! Leave him , D 'Argo . Aeryn ? We 're gonna try to get out of this . I told them our plan , and uh ... Oh ... Oh , baby . There are so many places that I wanted you to see . People . There 's this lake in Maine . Used to spend summers there when I was a kid . Had more mosquitoes than a dog had fleas . My dad and I , we 'd camp out there . And one night , the astronauts landed on the moon . I remember looking up at the sky . I knew right then what I was gonna do with the rest of my life . I couldn 't have been more than four years old . Yeah , I really wanted you to see that . Oh , damn . Baby , I ... I miss you already . Who else am I going to tell this crap to ? I love you . Aeryn : Take a look inside . You 'll see his image . The only love of my life . Priming first phase of reverse Starburst . Kahaynu , protect Moya . ( loud crash ) What now ? Zhaan , what 's going on ? Pilot ! What 's happening ? Priming for Starburst is making everything stop . We must break free ! My arms , I can 't move . You must initiate manual Starburst from Command . Do it ! I can 't reach the panel ! Help us ! Stark ! Crichton and I once shared Unity . So I can help him . If we join , we can keep time alive for him . John ? John ? John ? Zhaan , how the hell are you talking to me ? I fused my spirit with Stark . You must get to Command and initiate Starburst . Why can 't Pilot do it ? He can 't move . No one can move except you . I don 't know how long l can keep time alive . Hurry , John . I am too old for this shit . Hurry John ! This is ripping us apart . You must ... you must keep going ! ( echoes ) Keep going ! Crichton : What the hell is this stuff ? Pilot : It appears to be some kind of stellar mist . I 'm running tests on its chemical properties now . What do you think ? That we should go in there ? Well , it might be a good place to hide from Peacekeepers . No , Scorpius hasn 't been chasing us for a while . I 'm not sure we should go in there . Don 't worry , Chiana . I 'll fly a long-range recon in a Transport Pod to make sure it 's safe . No . No ! What 's that ? Just something Zhaan gave me for my headaches . Pilot ! Pilot ! Stark ! - You know what they 're about to do ? Yes , and these frelling Comms don 't work . Pilot ! Pilot ! Pilot , looks like we 're all agreed here . Except me . Except for Chiana . Let 's head into the mist . - Accelerating now . Stop ! Pilot stop the acceleration ! You 're young . Uh-huh . Zhaan , you all right ? What are you doing here ? I thought you were locked in your chamber meditating or some yotz like that . Shut up , Rygel . What 's the matter , Zhaan ? Don 't you remember ? Remember what ? Just trust us . Don 't go into the mist . Why not ? We had a vision . We sense there 's danger in there . I told them . I told them we shouldn 't go in there . I felt something too , Zhaan . Pilot , uh , change of plan . Hang a louie . That 's left , away from the mist . Pilot : Hard acceleration . Away . Stark , how is it that Aeryn and Crichton are young again ? We seem to have returned to a time just moments before Moya went into the mist . None of them remember anything , yet ... yet we do . Because we 've returned to a time before any of it happened . They have nothing to remember , Zhaan . I think we only remember because we were joined when Moya broke free . Well , what about Aeryn 's life and the family she had ? Let 's theorize that through every opening in a Center Halo , our world splits into an infinite number of universes . Are you saying that Ennixx could still be alive ? Yes . And mourning the loss of her grandmother . ( sighs ) But ... it 's time to tell Ka D 'Argo why I came aboard . ( computer beeping ) D 'Argo , um , I 've been waiting to show you this . I found it in a manifest of slaves being sold to the Katin mines . Who is this ? The manifest lists him as ... as Jothee , son of Ka D 'Argo . My son . My son is being sold into slavery . ( grunting angrily ) D 'Argo ! How long have you known ? ! Why didn 't you tell me ? ! I just found out . D 'Argo , Stark wanted me awake before he told you ! D 'Argo , let him go , please ! There 's plenty of time . The auction isn 't for a few solar days . We will find a way to rescue Jothee . D 'Argo ... D 'Argo . ( whispering ) : D 'Argo . All right . I 'm sorry , Stark . I , uh ... ( panting ) I 've got ... I 've got to ... save my son , Zhaan . We 've got to find a way . ( sighs ) What ? Nothing . Um ... do you get a feeling ? About what ? I don 't know. l-l just have this ... feeling ... something happened . Between us ? Yeah . Well , what kind of something do you think happened ? I don 't know . If something happened , I 'm sure we would have remembered . Yeah . Come here . Have a look at this . It 's ah , the locket Chiana gave me . I found it in the Transport Pod , and somehow it 's fused shut . I 'm trying to ... Did you put something in there ? No , nothing . ( grunts ) Looks like something disintegrated in there . Hmm .

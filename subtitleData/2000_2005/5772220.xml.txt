 Where are they ? Dad ! Uncle Merrill ! Morgan ! Bo ? Bo , where 's Morgan ? Are you in my dream , too ? - This is not a dr ... - Dad ! Morgan , what 's happening ? The dogs are barking . Woke us up . Are you hurt ? I think God did it . Did what , Morgan ? Lee , I don 't even care if it was him . Just have a word with him . That 'd be enough for me . It was strange , finding the crops that way . The kids were confused by it . It 'd take the strangeness away if I knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around . At the movies ? Are you sure ? All right , then . Thanks for your patience . Bye . Houdini peed . I think he 's sick . Why don 't you take him outside ? I 'll call Dr. Crawford . - He doesn 't treat animals . - He 'll know what to do . That was quick , Caroline . I called you folks two hours ago . Old Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle , as she puts it , diving for her life when some kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards . She went down to Thorton 's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards . Spittin ' ! By the time I got there , Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place . She must 've had a cold . I 'm telling you , I won 't eat for a week . So , what happened to your crops ? Dad 's gonna burn these again . It 's contaminated . You don 't even know what that word means . It 's not contaminated . It 's just tap water . Pour it in his bowl . - It tastes funny . - It does not . Besides , he licks his butt every day . I don 't think he 'll mind . Houdini ? Bo , don 't run . What 's wrong , boy ? Stop it . Look at where it 's bent over , Father . It 's not broken . What machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it ? Can 't be by hand . It 's too perfect . Doesn 't sound like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers . They can 't piss without wetting the front of their pants . I don 't think anyone else around here has had any problems . I was over Theo Henry 's farm yesterday afternoon . - He would 've mentioned something . - Why were you at Theo 's ? Some animals around the county have been acting funny . Some of them violent . - Is it a virus ? - I don 't think so , Father . They 're more edgy . On alert . It 's almost like they act when they smell a predator , peeing on themselves and everything . Caroline ? Please stop calling me " Father " . - What 's wrong ? - I don 't hear my children . He fell on me . He wanted to kill Bo . - Did he hurt you ? - No . I 'm so sorry . Where were you ? Houdini 's sick . Tie Isabelle up to the back of the shed , please . Make sure the knot 's tight . What 's the matter ? There 's a monster outside my room . Can I have a glass of water ? What 's wrong with the water next to your bed ? It tastes old . What are you thinking about ? Why do you talk to Mom when you 're by yourself ? Makes me feel better . Does she ever answer back ? No . She never answers me , either . Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back . It 's time for an ass-whoopin ' . This is not an intelligent way to approach this . Lee is a friend . - This is his son . - We 'll be doing Lee a favor . We go outside , move around the house in opposite directions . We act insane with anger , make them crap in their pants . Force them around till we meet up on the other side . - Explain " act crazy " . - Curse and stuff . - Want me to curse ? - You don 't mean it . It 's just for show . It won 't be convincing . It doesn 't sound natural when I curse . - Just make noises , then . - Explain " noises " . - Are you gonna do this or what ? - No , I 'm not . You want them stealing from the house next time ? On the count of three . I 'm insane with anger ! We 're gonna beat your ass , bitch ! We 're gonna tear your head off ! I 'm losing my mind ! It 's time for an ass-whoopin ' ! - I cursed . - I heard . How did he get up ... ? Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard ? You like that ? You got an old baby monitor around ? Bo had an old baby monitor . You can use Bo 's monitor as a walkie-talkie . You can ? It only works one way , but it 'll do fine . Until someone gets you a new walkie-talkie left over at the station . Turn that down till Officer Paski leaves . You 're too old to still be doing this . You take a glass of water and you finish it . What 's wrong with this ? - It has dust in it . - This one ? A hair . Morgan took a sip and it has his amoebas in it . How are you , Merrill ? Fine . How 's work at the gas station ? Stimulating . I never got a chance to tell you , but I thought you moving in here with your brother after ... That was a nice thing to do . I don 't think I 'm helping much . You are . Sorry . OK , so far I have : " It was very dark . " Yes , it was . You can 't describe him at all ? Don 't you think that 's odd ? A little . I don 't know whether to look for a giant or a midget . No , he definitely wasn 't a midget . So he was tall ? - I would say so . - Probably . Over six feet ? - It was very dark . - Yes . How certain are you that this was a male ? I don 't know any girls who could run like that . I don 't know . I have seen some of those women on the Olympics . They can run like the wind . This guy got on our roof in a second . Our roof is ten feet high . They have women 's high jumping in the Olympics . They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me . Caroline , I know you 're making a point , but what is it ? An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon , and started yelling and cussing because they didn 't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine . She scared a couple of the customers . No-one 's seen her since . And my point is , we don 't know anything about the person you saw . We should just keep all possibilities available . Dad , where 's the remote ? I don 't know , baby . Check in the sofa cushions . Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house , what else might be a possibility ? I 'm not done asking questions . And I don 't appreciate sarcasm . Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge against you ? Maybe a church member ? Who might not have liked the fact you left the church ? I don 't think so . I was out of line with the female Scandinavian Olympian thing . It 's just , I 'm pretty strong , and I 'm pretty fast . And I was running as fast as I could , and this guy was just toying with us . There 's only food under the sofa . Baby , just change the channel on the television ? - I did . - And ? Same show is on every station . Every station . Turn up the volume . Crop signs first emerged in the late ' 70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life . They died out by the early ' 80s . Dismissed as hoaxes . This new resurgence is wholly different . The speed and quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals , over many countries . There are only a limited number of explanations . Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created , or , basically it 's for real . Extraterrestrials . What in God 's name is going on ? I did some research after I saw your crops . Two or three guys can make a design the size of yours overnight , - using just boards and ropes . - Really ? That 's how these things have been done in the past . But there 's so many now . How could so many people be in on it ? I can 't think straight . I 'm going back to the station and have a cup of Edgar 's coffee . Try to think clear . After that , I might make some calls . But I 'll tell you , what I said in there , it still goes . Your family has been through a lot . The last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world . Take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things . Good medicine . That 's good advice . And you take care of yourself . Graham . The footage was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore , a southern city of India . It 's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours . Uncle Merrill , will you turn on the radio ? They are signs intended to be seen from the sky ... No radio , either . Just for a while . - Book money ? - Sure . Just one . Be back for pizza in 15 . It 's just a bunch of crock . They 're trying to sell sodas , it 's plain and simple . Been watching these reports since morning . I have seen twelve soda commercials so far . Twelve ! Do you have any books on extraterrestrials ? You don 't believe this horse manure ? I think we have one . Came by mistake in a shipment . Decided to keep it for the city people . Last row , third book on the left , honey . Why is no-one saying the obvious ? These are just copycats . Someone , somewhere , does the first one . It was asthma medicine , right , Father ? For Morgan Hess . And it 's not " Father " any more . ... a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea and here we are , on the verge of mass hysteria . Can I ask you a favor , Father ? I need to clear my conscience . Will you listen to me ? Tracey , I am not a Reverend any more . I haven 't been for six months . You know this . All this stuff on TV , Joe Gills came in talking about the end of the world , I 'm just a little scared . Please , I need to clear my conscience . I 've got it figured . - You do ? - I 've had two separate folks tell me there 've been strangers around here last couple of nights . Can 't tell what they look like , 'cause they 're staying in the shadows , covert-like . Nobody 's been hurt . And that 's the give-away . - I see . - It 's called " probing " . It 's a military procedure . You send out a reconnaissance group , very small . Check things out . Not to engage , but to evaluate the situation . Evaluate the level of danger . Make sure things are all clear . Clear for what ? For the rest of them . Yeah . You got a pamphlet or something I can read ? - Sure . - Thanks . You didn 't use to play baseball , did you ? Shit , I know you , you 're Merrill Hess . I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the wall . Set the record . Man , that thing had a motor on it . It 's still the record , right ? Got the bat at home . On the wall . You 've got two minor-league home run records ? Five . Why weren 't you in the pros , making stacks of cash , and getting your toes licked by beautiful women ? 'Cause he has another record most people don 't know about . He has the minor-league strikeout record . Hello , Lionel . Merrill 's a Class-A screw-up . He 'd just swing that bat as hard as he could . Didn 't matter what the coaches said or who was on base . He 'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could . Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree . Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players . You really got the strikeout record ? Felt wrong not to swing . It 's contaminated . Carl , there 's something wrong with our water . Your water 's fine . Bo has this thing about her drinking water . She had it her whole life . It 's like a tick people have , except it 's not a tick . Is that right ? Thirteen ! I 'll take it . I cursed 37 times last week . I said the " f " word a couple times , but mostly ... " shits " and ... " bastards " . Is " douchebag " a curse ? I suppose that would depend on its usage . How about , " John , you 're a douchebag for kissing Barbara " ? It 's a curse . Then it 's not 37 , it 's 71 . Pharmacy crowded ? None of you are to spend time with Tracey Abernathy alone . Understood ? Is that him ? Who is he ? - What is it ? - It 's Bo 's baby monitor . I found it in the basement . I 'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie . What if it 's catching a signal from them ? - It 's not . - But it wasn 't working . This crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend . They 're 30 , they work up codes together , they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies , where other guys who never had girlfriends can join in . They do stupid crap like this to feel special . It 's a scam . Nerds were doing it 25 years ago , and new nerds are doing it again . It 's just static . Turn it up and see . It 's a code . Why can 't they get girlfriends ? Can I see that , please ? It 's noise . It 's broken . It 's just gonna keep doing this . - Maybe some new batteries . - We might lose the signal . This is exactly what the nerds want . I 'm getting out now . Nobody move ! Voices . Did you hear that ? Not English , though . You heard the voices , Uncle Merrill ? I heard them . Probably picking up another baby monitor . That 's right . Let me see it . Stop ! This is why we 're not watching TV . People get obsessed . - I 'm letting go now . - No , Dad ! - Don 't do it ! - You 'll lose the signal . Don 't let go . It gets clearer the higher you hold it . I got it . Bo , honey , I don 't want you climbing on the car . Stop ! There 's two of them talking . Isabelle , you 're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe . You 're wasting your time here ! I 'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops , to the news or TV or anybody . You 're not going to get famous . Let 's turn on the TV . ... first appeared 52 minutes ago . Mexico City officials as well as US officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government 's air force . The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York , as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City airspace . They were not detected by radar by either country . - The nerds were right . - We have to tape this . My ballet recital . Listen , Bo , this is very important . Everything written in science books is going to change . The history of the world 's future is on the TV right now . We need to record this so you can show your children and say you were there . For your children . - My ballet recital . - Dad ? Find another tape . Uncle Merrill , I 'm using your tape . You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City . This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way . What you 're seeing is real . It 's unbelievable . Everything they wrote in science books is about to change . I told you . Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world . That 's true . Do you think it could be ? Yes . How can you say that ? That wasn 't the answer you wanted ? Couldn 't you pretend to be like you used to be ? Give me some comfort . People break down into two groups . When they experience something lucky , group number one sees it as more than luck . More than coincidence . They see it as a sign . Evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them . Group number two sees it as just pure luck . A happy turn of chance . I 'm sure people in group two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way . For them , this situation is a 50 / 50 . Could be bad . Could be good . But deep down , they feel that whatever happens , they 're on their own . And that fills them with fear . Yeah , there are those people . But there 's a whole lot of people in group number one . When they see those 14 lights , they 're looking at a miracle . And deep down , they feel that whatever 's going to happen , there 'll be someone there to help them . And that fills them with hope . So you have to ask yourself , what kind of person are you ? Are you the kind that sees signs , sees miracles , or do you believe that people just get lucky ? Or , look at the question this way . Is is possible that there are no coincidences ? I was at this party once . I 'm on the couch with Randa McKinney . She 's just sitting there , looking beautiful , staring at me . I go to lean in and kiss her , and I realize I have gum in my mouth . So I turn , take out the gum , stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa , and turn around . Randa McKinney throws up all over herself . I knew the second it happened , it was a miracle . I could 've been kissing her when she threw up . That would 've scarred me for life . I may never have recovered . I 'm a miracle man . Those lights are a miracle . There you go . So , which type are you ? Do you feel comforted ? Yeah , I do . Then what does it matter ? I never told you the last words Colleen said before they let her die . She said " See " . And her eyes glazed a bit . And then she said " Swing away " . You know why she said that ? 'Cause the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died . Some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head . There is no-one watching out for us . We are all on our own . - What do you know ? - There was an accident , drunk driving . Not drunk . Ray fell asleep at the wheel . - Is he OK ? - Yeah . That was the first thing Colleen asked , too . She 's talking ? What ambulance is she in ? She 's not in an ambulance , Father . For the kids ' protection . They were watching TV from 5 : 00 a.m. They were getting obsessed , like you said . They should be playing " furry , furry rabbit " . - What 's " furry , furry rabbit " ? - It 's a game . They closed the schools . And there 's been some interesting developments . - What time is it ? - 11 : 00 a.m. They 're gone , but they 're not really gone . We just can 't see them . Early this morning , a bird flew where the lights were last night . It stopped in the air and fell straight down . They been playing the tape all morning . The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky . The bird 's head was crushed in . They think there 's some invisible shield . Like an optical illusion . They 're still there . Hovering . Some people think there 's more of them now . All over the place , over us , even . There 's a theory about the crop circles . They think they 'd be some kind of ... Some kind of landmark , visual mapping systems , so they could navigate . Coordinate . Makes sense . So the aliens can 't read our minds . Of course . They tell you everything in this book . It says they 're probably very small , like my height , because as their brains developed , there was no use for physical development . They 're probably vegetarians , they realized the benefits of such a diet . Who wrote this book ? Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs . - That means they 're unemployed . - If you 're gonna make fun , forget it . This is serious . I don 't know what got into me . There are pictures . Dr. Bimboo , one of the authors of the book ... - Bimboo ? - Dad . - I just asked his name . - You had a tone . He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us . To make contact to further their knowledge of the universe , or the other reason . They 're hostile . They 've used up their resources , and now they 're looking to harvest our planet next . Looks a little like our house , doesn 't it ? - Same windows . - That 's weird . That 's enough from Dr. Bimboo for now . Everybody needs to calm down . Eat some fruit or something . - Hello ? - Father ? I 'm going out for a few minutes . No-one leaves this house , no-one . Where are you going ? Ray Reddy 's house . - Why ? - I think he just called here . You don 't think something bad will happen , do you , Morgan ? Why ? You have one of your feelings again ? Is it bad ? I won 't let anything bad happen to you . I don 't want you to die . Who said I was gonna die ? Hello , Ray . What happened ? I wrote your number down to call you . It 's been sitting next to the phone for six months . When I knew it was inside the house , I couldn 't think of any other number to call . I panicked . Thank you for coming , Father . You 're welcome , Ray . I worked so long that night . I 've never fallen asleep driving before . - Never since . - Don 't ... Most of the ride home , there wasn 't a car in sight in either direction . If I 'd have fallen asleep then , I would 've ended up in a ditch with a headache . It had to be at that right moment . That ten , 15 seconds when I passed her walking . It was like it was meant to be . I guess if this is the end of the world , I 'm screwed , right ? People who kill reverends ' wives aren 't ushered into heaven . Where are you going ? To the lake . Way I see it , this place is marked in crops and such . None of them are really near water . I don 't think they like water . Can 't be any worse than here . Did you see something , Ray ? I know what I 've done to you . I made you question your faith . I 'm truly sorry for what I 've done to you and yours . Don 't open my pantry , Father . I found one of them in there and locked him in . The footage we 're about to show was photographed by 42-year-old Romero Valadarez . This video was taken yesterday at his son 's seventh birthday in Passo Fundo , Brazil . It was sent to the news bureau there and sent via satellite a few minutes ago . All initial opinions are this is genuine . What you 're about to see may disturb you . Move , children ! ¡ Vamonos ! Hello . The police are here . I am with them . I am a police officer . I just want to talk with you . We know all about the hoax . We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon . Just tell us your name and why you did it and we 'll give you the same deal we gave the others . Don 't throw your life away , son . Their skin changes colors . That 's why we couldn 't see them that night . Tell me something , Morgan . In this book of yours , did they detail what would happen if they were hostile ? Yes . Said they would probably invade . They would use ground tactics . Hand-to-hand combat . They wouldn 't use technology or fight an airborne battle , 'cause they know eventually we 'd use nuclear weapons , and the planet would be useless to them . How could anyone possibly know that information ? It 's ridiculous . What else did it say ? They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion . One , they are defeated and have to return again with full forces , hundreds , maybe even thousands of years later . What 's two ? They win . I 'm sorry , what book is this ? Is this really happening ? I heard a theory that they don 't like places near water . Maybe we 'd be safe from them near a lake . Sounds made-up . I saw one of them at Ray Reddy 's house . I can 't be sure , but I got the distinct feeling it wanted to harm me . So , we can choose to believe this lake idea , pack up and go , or we can stay here , hide inside our home , wait it out . We might be overreacting , but I 'm willing to live with that . Either way , at least we 'll be together . All those in favor of the lake idea , raise your hand . All those in favor of home , raise your hand . - OK , my vote counts as two . - That 's bullshit , you 're cheating ! Calm down . I represent two parents here . We don 't know anything yet . We 'll be safe here , anyway . I don 't want to leave home . This is where we lived with Mom . That 's got nothing to do with this . - I change my vote . - You can 't change your vote . All those in favor of home , raise your hand . This is ridiculous . You lose . Three to two . We 're going to board up every window in this house . How do we know boards will do anything ? Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors . This information comes from our affiliates across the world . Dad , Uncle Merrill . ... Amman joins Nairobi , Beijing and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights . There are lights in over 274 cities . They think it 'll be 400 within the hour . They 're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs . They were for navigation . They made a map . They 're gonna be within a mile of us . They think these are stages preceding an attack maneuver . I was wrong . They 're hostile . It 's like War of the Worlds . Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe . Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples , synagogues and churches . God be with us all . I 'm going to get back to the windows . You guys OK ? Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world . Don 't worry . You won 't let anything happen to us , right ? No way . - I wish you were my dad . - What did you say ? Don 't you ever say anything like that again . Ever . There 's too many windows in the bedrooms . - We don 't have enough boards . - We 'll board up the doors . - Where are we gonna sleep ? - In the family room . What about Isabelle ? We 'll tie her up in the garage after dinner . I 'll make some sandwiches . - I want spaghetti . - We 'll just eat fast . Spaghetti sounds great . - What do you want , Morgan ? - Anything ? French toast . And mashed potatoes . Now we 're talking . How about you , Merrill ? - Chicken teriyaki . - Good choice . I 'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon . Extra bacon . What 's the matter with everyone ? Eat . - Maybe we should say a prayer ? - No . - Why not ? - We 're not saying a prayer . Bo has a bad feeling . - I had a dream . - We aren 't saying a prayer . Eat . I hate you . - That 's fine . - You let Mom die . I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer . Not one more minute . Understood ? Now , we are going to enjoy this meal . No one can stop us from enjoying this meal , so enjoy it ! Stop crying ! Don 't yell at her ! All right , since you 're not gonna eat , I 'm gonna try some of everything . It 's happening . Graham , hurry ! Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born , Bo ? You came outta your momma , and you didn 't even cry . You just opened your eyes and looked around the room at everybody . Your eyes were so big and gorgeous , all the ladies in the room just gasped . They literally gasped . They go , " Oh , she 's like an angel . " They said , " We 've never seen a baby so beautiful . " And then , you know what happened ? They put you on the table to clean you up , and you looked up at me and you smiled . They say babies that young can 't smile . You smiled . Let 's go down now . We forgot Isabelle . Should we turn off the lights ? They already know we 're here . Dad ? Do you know what happened when you were born , Morgan ? You came out , and your momma kept bleeding . The doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you . They 're on the roof . While they were fixing her up , all she kept asking about was you . They 're in the house . I wanted your momma to see you first , because she had dreamed about you her whole life . And she got feeling better , they brought you in , and they placed you in her arms . She looked at you , and you looked at her , and you just stared at each other for the longest time . And then she said , real soft , " Hello , Morgan , I 'm your momma . " " You looked just how I dreamed . " The attic door . Let 's go . Come on . I forgot our foil helmets . Is there anything to wedge against the door ? They 'll read our minds . - You 're scaring your sister . - I 'm already scared . - I 'm looking ! - They 'll know our secret thoughts . I 'm not ready . Got it ! Where 's Bo ? I 'm OK . What 's happening out there ? I can 't even imagine . Hope they 're doing better than we are . We don 't even have helmets . They 're only making noises . They 're not trying to get in . Why would they do that ? They want our attention on the door ? - They 're distracting us . - From what ? The book says they 're good problem solvers . They 'll find a way in . Morgan , give me your flashlight . They used to pour coal down in this basement . There 's a coal chute in here . - I can feel air . - Me , too ! - It 's getting stronger . - We 're close . What ? Pull him . You got him ? - Pull him ! - I got him . We don 't have his medicine . Don 't be afraid , Morgan . We 'll slow this down together . Feel my chest . Feel it moving in and out . Breathe like me . I dreamed this . Stay with me . I know , it hurts . Be strong , baby . It 'll pass . Don 't do this to me again . Not again . I hate You . The fear is feeding it . Don 't be afraid of what 's happening . Believe it 's going to pass . Believe it . Just wait . Don 't be afraid . The air is coming . Believe . We don 't have to be afraid . It 's about to pass . Here it comes . Don 't be afraid . Here comes the air . Don 't be afraid , Morgan . Feel my chest . Breathe with me . Together . The air is going in our lungs . Together . Together , we 're the same . We 're the same . We should save the flashlights . Ray 's truck swerved off the road , and he hit Colleen , and then a tree . She was pinned between the two . What does that mean , " pinned " ? The truck , the truck has severed most of her lower half . What did you say ? She won 't be saved . Her body is pinned in such a way that it 's alive when it shouldn 't be alive . And the truck is holding her together . She doesn 't feel much , and she 's talking almost like normal . We didn 't pull the truck out , 'cause we want you to come and be with her as long as she 's awake . And that won 't be very long . Now , Father , do you understand what I 've told you ? Caroline is this the last time I 'm gonna talk with my wife ? Yes , it is . People think they came here to take over the planet . That 's bull . I don 't think that . My friend and I saw them . I found a pack of light bulbs . They poisoned his family , they dragged them away . Nobody believes me , but they didn 't come here for our planet . This is a raid . They came here for us , to harvest us . We 're lucky as hell they 're leaving . - They 're leaving ? - That 's what they said . How long have we been sleeping ? Twelve hours or so . They said they had poison gas . They secrete it in small amounts . A lot of people died . - But they 're leaving ? - They left real fast this morning . Something scared them off . They left some of their wounded behind . Why are they going ? People must have figured out a way to beat them . Everyone has a weakness , right ? You didn 't think we 'd make it through the night , did you ? Listen . There 's things I can take , and a couple things I can 't . One of them I can 't take is when my older brother , who 's everything I want to be , starts losing faith in things . I saw your eyes last night . I don 't want to ever see your eyes like that again , OK ? I 'm serious . He 's been like that for a while . He needs his medicine . Have they said anything about our area ? Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared . But who knows for sure ? He 's not strong enough . - If he has another attack ... - I know . We 'd have to be sure before we opened up that door . - Good enough for me . - Me , too . Get the syringe as well . We may need to give him an epinephrine shot . They 're doing this on TV . - They 're dancing . - Yeah , like this . You want to see it ? I 'll bring the TV in here . We know the battle turned around in the Middle East . Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them . We have no further details at this time . Merrill , wait . - Hi , sweetie . - Hi , baby . I was just taking a walk before dinner . You love walks . It was meant to be . Does it hurt ? - I don 't feel much . - Good . Tell Morgan to play games . - It 's OK to be silly . - I will . Tell Bo to listen to her brother . - He 'll always take care of her . - I will . - And tell Graham ... - I 'm here . Tell him ... See . Tell him to see . And tell Merrill to swing away .

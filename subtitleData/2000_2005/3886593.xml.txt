 Here 's another one ! Good work Marguerite . You know , given the depth of these paving stones , someone built this road at least five hundred years ago . Leading all the way from the Summerlee river ... right up to that cave . Why ? Economics George , roads are expensive . The only reason they 're built is to transport something of even greater value . Some kind of treasure ? Why else would anybody be out here playing hide and seek with raptors ? The betterment of humanity through the pursuit of knowledge perhaps ? Well you follow your dreams professor I will follow mine . Shall we ? Careful Marguerite ... similar structures in Egypt were known to be cleverly booby trapped . A few booby traps are the least of our worries . Hello what have we here ? Guardians ... of some sort by the looks of them . Not very friendly ones . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Look at all of this silver . Oh Marguerite , has anybody ever told you you 've got a one track mind . And you don 't ? You know , I really don 't know exactly what you are . What are you looking for a label ? Adventuress , grieving widow , international jewel thief wanted on five continents , that sort of thing ? What I meant is ... what passions drove you to learn ? I mean you have exceptional skills in geology , archeology , linguistics . Surely they 're not just a means to some gemological wealth . Why George , I think I 'm flattered . It 's not often someone thinks there 's something more to me than ... just a healthy sense of self preservation . Now I 'm not saying that there is something more . Marguerite ! Marguerite ! Marguerite ! Marguerite ! Marguerite up here . - What happened ? - Booby trap . Can you move ? Carefully . No ! Damn it ! Change of plan . Don 't move . Can you feel your toes ? I can feel everything George I just can 't do anything about it . I 'm not going to be able to get you out of there by myself . What ? Well you just stay still . I 'm going to go back and get the others . - I 'll be as quick as I can . - Don 't rush on my account . I 'm not going anywhere . I suppose I should thank you for clearing ... away some of these spikes before I dropped in . Oh , you 've really done it this time . Who would build a road in the middle of the jungle ? Good question ... from the river to that ancient temple in the cave . It must be a place of some importance . A thousand years ago . Nice of them to leave them a booby trap . The sooner we get Marguerite out of there the better . You 're telling me . Knowing Marguerite those poor raptors don 't stand a chance . Could this day get any better ? Really Madge you 've had worse . Right now ! Show yourself ! Adrienne ? It 's been a long time , hasn 't it ? I 'll say ... you 've been dead 12 years . If that were true shouldn 't you be afraid ? Of my best friend ? Oh , no ! I can explain you very easily . I 'm hallucinating maybe even dying . I wouldn 't let that happen to you . Why ? I let it happen to you . Whoever you are , stand aside . We have no quarrel with you . Apparently we do . Malone ? Malone . Are you all right ? I think so . Who were they ? - And why 'd they give up ? - Get the first aid . I have no idea why they retreated , but I believe they are guardians of the temple . Are you saying you 've seen them before ? Inside the cave , there 's a frieze ... with three warriors identical to our attackers . Then that ancient temple still is important to someone . I entered the cave and then came out . Can that be an act of sacrilege ? Well if you committed sacrilege , what about Marguerite ? I 'll get Malone back to the treehouse , you two better get to Marguerite . - Good . - Will you be all right ? - Go . - Don 't worry about us . Come on . Remember Paris ? We called the fat man 's bar ' The Pit ' . We did . - Ah but when you sung . - Oh please birds fell from the trees . You had the voice of an angel . But that wasn 't enough was it ? Our dreams would have come true Madge . All we needed was a few more months , weeks who 's to say . Madge ! Marguerite ! You can 't sleep silly , not with a concussion . I didn 't sleep for weeks because of you . - I still have nightmares . - Shhh ! that 's behind us . 12 years ago in Paris I knew why they came for you . I knew where you 'd hidden the jewelry . I could have ... given it back , I could have saved you . No , I told you not to . Those jewels , they belonged to us . I did wait for you , you know ... for months . And then when I thought they were coming back for me ... I took the jewelry and I went to Monte Carlo . Did you marry ? Yeah , a dream come true ... a millionaire ... two mistresses and an overdraft . And then what happened . This road hasn 't been used for centuries . Those guardians must have some kind of vantage point nearby . Not too near I trust . How did you come to this God forsaken plateau ? Boy you are one nosy hallucination . Now that is a story worth sharing . Twelve years ago in Shanghai ... this is long before I heard of ... Professor George Edward Challenger . There 's the Frieze . You see just like the guardians ... same weapons , same masks . - Very pretty , now where 's Marguerite ? - Just up ahead . So ... I walked out of that alleyway ... into Challenger 's lecture and just ... told them I 'd fund the entire expedition . And do the others know why you 're really here ? No , no , no ... they 'd feel betrayed ... and , after everything we have been through , I owe them more than that . It is so nice to finally tell someone the truth . Thank you . - Marguerite ! - Marguerite ! It 's about bloody time boys . Good to see you too , Marguerite . Stay right where you are . It 's all right Marguerite , you 're going home . You 're safe now . - I know . - Up you come . Here , slip into this . What about me ? Who 's there ? - You heard that ? - Of course I did . Who 's down here with you ? I 'm Adrienne Montclair . She 's my hallucination . You don 't understand , she isn 't really there . I 'm worried about her , internal injuries I think . She 's dead . How 'd you manage not to hurt yourself when you fell into the hole ? I didn 't fall . There are tunnels all through this rock . I came into it from below . I have to say , I was as shocked as Madge to find myself face to face with her . After so many years . It 's a remarkable coincidence . Not really . Madge and I always dreamed of coming to South America ... - to search for gems . - She looks the same . Let 's go . I 'll be waiting my love . Fortunately that scrape wasn 't as bad as it looked . Then why is she still unconscious ? Exhaustion I 'm sure . Those spikes could have been covered with poison . I 'm sorry , it 's been a long time since I 've tasted anything this fresh . You haven 't told us where your camp is . It 's at the base of this enormous plateau . You know a way down ? Of course , it 's through those tunnels we were in . Well that 's fantastic , we 've spent almost two years trying to find a way off . And you still believe everything you hear . Marguerite told me about you . Odd , that she never told us about you . However improbable our meeting may have been ... it could turn out to be fortunate . Once Marguerite and Malone have recovered we . Why wait ? Roxton and I can look after Malone and Madge . While you and Veronica go and scout the tunnels . It could be helpful to get one of those wooden spikes . Check for poison . There has to be some reason that Marguerite 's in such a deep sleep . Then it 's settled , I 'll make a sketch of the temple layout for you . Paper and pencil . And while she 's doing that Veronica we can get ready . Maybe they 'll find a way back home . Now there 's a good reason to get better don 't you agree ? Going home back to London . Because if you 're not with us , with me , well I 'm not sure I could leave this place without you . Rest is what she needs most of all Lord Roxton . And so do you . I wonder if Marguerite knows how lucky she is to have missed those spikes . - Challenger ? - You collect the spike . I 'm just going on into the central chamber . You know as well as I do that we should stick together . How 's Malone ? Still sound asleep , but much better . Ned and Madge are very lucky to have a friend like you ... so concerned for them both . We 've all been through a lot together . I know Madge told me . She even told me how you like your tea . Double brewed , splash of milk ... in a china cup ... not a earthen mug . Thank you . Most men wouldn 't be . I 'm sorry ? So concerned about Madge . Considering the way she feels about you . Most men would lose interest . She told you ? How she feels about me ? She has told me everything Lord Roxton . Oh she does find you attractive , in a rugged sort of way . But she knows you and she will never have a future . I don 't believe you . She said you wouldn 't . Because of those time 's when she gave in to ... well , danger can be an aphrodisiac . Physical needs can overpower reason quite easily . Yes , well thank you for the tea . But Madge and I are different though . Unlike her ... I believe physical needs are as important as reason . And she has told me everything about you Lord Roxton . John no . Help me . Marguerite . That 's why I 'm here Madge . According to this , second exit passages ... under the altar . There must be some way of moving it . Pressure switch perhaps ? Or a release for a counter balance . Oh Marguerite when it comes to booby traps we 're even . I 'm still in one piece Veronica . You know I ... I saw you die . Looks clean to me . Challenger ? - Get away from him . - Easy now miss ... no one 's looking for trouble . Ask your friend here , he knows me . Do you ? To be precise , I recognize who he 's supposed to be ... the noted explorer William Maple White . He 's the reason you came to the plateau . You found his journals . Let 's get the story straight miss . I showed my journal to Professor Challenger ... and my photographic plates of a Pterodactyl . And minutes later you died . I fell into a coma . The natives looked after me . I woke three weeks later to find you gone ... and my work , my life 's work , was gone with you . - Is that possible ? - No , maybe . I didn 't see him buried . I left the village that night . So you could claim my discoveries as your own . No , never . I have always paid tribute to the path ... you blazed for the world to follow , always . It 's so hot in here . I can 't breathe . All right that 's enough , we 're going home . Ah , splendid idea . You 're not invited . I 've got to rest . I don 't know why I 'm so tired . - What did you do to your hand ? - I cut it on the altar . It might be blood poisoning or some kind of infection . This can be a dangerous place Challenger . As I wrote in my journal remember . That 's enough out of you . You 're a feisty little miss . I 'm especially feisty ... Get down ! They 're not human . Challenger ! It 's the blood . When Malone was bloodied they stopped their attack just as they did now . Welcome back . It must be safe now . They were after the two of you not me . We have to get back to the others . And Adrienne Montclair ... she is no more who or what she says she is than you are . Marguerite ? Marguerite , are you all right ? How could you kiss that thing ? - Sorry it wasn 't my idea . - Yeah , spoken like a man . - You need to rest . - You don 't understand . Adrienne and I were friends 12 years ago . In the club where we worked she met a man ... made a deal and didn 't follow through with her end of the bargain . He sent people for her . She never came back . - Then she must have escaped . - Not from those people , John . Well she 's here now and I don 't know , she got away . Why does she look exactly like I remember her ? Not a day older , not a minute . That is not Adrienne . That is my memory of her taken from my mind . You don 't need her Lord Roxton ... not when you have me . I don 't want you . You act as if you have a choice . Take my jewelry off . Fair is fair Madge . You stole mine when you betrayed me . That 's not true . True or not it 's what you feel . It 's what 's in your mind . Fear ... and guilt ... and self loathing . Oh , so pure ... so clean ... so powerful . You brought everything on yourself . And what 's mine is mi ... No ! You don 't want to fight me , Lord Roxton not when there are so many more pleasant things ... we could do , you and I. - What are you ? - Lonely . After a thousand years you would be too ... don 't you think ? You go to hell . I 've been there Lord Roxton ... and I 'm not going back . Veronica ... I appeal to your sense of reason . Challenger 's confused . If I 'm not who I say I am then who else could I be ? I don 't care if you 're Maple-White or Rumplestiltskin ... stop following us . I know the way off the plateau . Then there 's no reason for you to stay , is there ? You 're making a mistake miss . Would you like to do something about it ? Not at the moment . You mean not ever . Come on Challenger we 're almost home . Roxton ! Malone ! Marguerite ! - They 've gone for a stroll . - They what ? I know what you are . You couldn 't even begin to imagine what I am . I don 't need to imagine . Blood called you forth . Lucky guess . What was that Challenger ? You 'll have to speak up . Time to join your friends . At last . We 've waited so long . We 're flesh again . We 're free . And when we 've withdrawn all the life force from our benefactors ... We 'll live again . Come here beloved . Let me show you what I could only dream of for a thousand years . There are two of them ? Adrienne Montclair and William Maple-White . Maple-White ? At least that 's who they claimed to be . But I fear they 're ectoplasmic manifestations . Ghosts ? In the vernacular yes . At least some form of ghost . How is it that a scientist believes in ghosts ? After all we 've seen on this plateau ? But science tells us energy and matter cannot arise out of nothing . If these two ghosts ... have taken on physicality they must have a source of energy . Well it 's us , you and me . That 's why we feel this way . They 're taking our life from us . How is that possible ? What if , after a thousand years , two disembodied spirits , who were once lovers , forgot who they were in life . And they reached into your minds and assumed the forms of ... two people never far from your thoughts . Two people whom we both feel we may have wronged . Adrienne and Maple-White are ... reflections of a guilty conscience ? Yes , and once they have drawn out of us our life force ... - then they will be fully alive . - And we 'll be dead . No , I won 't let that happen . We have something they want , so ... In sufficient quantities this is an exceedingly fast acting poison . I can almost see your face the way it was . Soon you will remember everything . Let 's see if I can jog your memory one more time . - Ah - What ? What 's he done ? - Time to barter . - He drank this . You don 't belong here . And we are both prepared to do whatever it takes ... - to make sure you leave . - You 're bluffing . They die , you die . Unless we give them the antidote . - What do you want from us ? - Let us leave the treehouse . You can have it Eat your heads off . Leave us alone and let us find a way off the plateau . Agreed . But before you leave you have to give them the antidote . Deal . Challenger told us what to take , let 's pack it up . I 'll get some clothes for Marguerite . Marguerite , come on , come on ... drink it . Challenger , Challenger ... drink , drink it . - We 're ready to go . - So , so are we . Go , go . Now , just so you know , if you decide to break your agreement there 's lots more poison ... but this is the last of the antidote . Such arrogance . No wonder Madge hates you . If we stay near them ... we 'll soon grow enough life to make our own lives eternal . And Challenger and Marguerite will die . Oh no we 'll do better than that . We 'll hunt them down . We 'll kill them all . Kill them all , yes . - Marguerite and I can make it from here . - What ? That wasn 't part of the plan . It has to be . What I am planning may not work out . We 've all faced death together before . Not like this . There is a metal running through the walls of this cave that I have never seen before . I believe it acts like a Faraday Cage . That 's a wire cage that keeps electrical emanations in . Or out . Which is why , I believe ... the spirits of the dead persist in the cave and why if any of us die in there ... Our spirits will be trapped forever . Marguerite and I have no choice in the matter . But I can 't ask the rest of you to risk eternity for me . Neither can I. No , nonsense . I can 't let you ... Listen John , even I have to admit there are ... questions of faith beyond science . It 's a wise man who understands the difference . I wasn 't asleep the whole time . Let 's go Marguerite , before the apparitions return . For come back they will , and they will fight for their existence ... - as shall we . - No , we 'll stop them . No ! You must let them into the cave ... otherwise we 'll never be rid of them . Challenger ... I can only hope this crazy idea works . If it doesn 't ... never ever return to this place . Have I ever told you how much I hate this plateau ? Not today you haven 't . It doesn 't matter where they die , as long as we 're beside them . Your plan was to bring us back here all along , wasn 't it ? That 's right , Challenger 's waiting . Whatever clever little plan he 's got worked out it 's far too late to stop us now . Then go ! - Let me go ! - Roxton it 's the only way . Just let me go . I 'm fine . No Roxton ! Come back here , you gutless bastards ! Come on take me ! - Roxton , no ! - Take my life instead ! No , no , let Challenger take care of it ! No ! Damn you ! Damn you both to hell . I can feel pain , we 're almost there . Our guilty friends must be on their way . What about the guardians ? They 're the spiritual equivalent of watch dogs I think ... trained to recapture any spirits let loose from this cave . Remember what Challenger said ... it 's a fight between science and the supernatural . There 's nothing you can do . We need you here Roxton . They 'll be back . What happens if this doesn 't work ? Then we will have all the time in the world ... to figure out what went wrong . There . That really hurts . I 've seen drainage groves like these before . So have I. Why sacrifice people in a place where their spirits will be trapped forever ? Maybe it 's not a sacrifice . What an execution ? If those buried here were brutal criminals ... beyond normal justice ... what harsher sentence than that they should spend eternity ... contemplating their own crimes . With three relentless guards to make sure they never escape . They contacted us because we spilt our blood here . And this is how we kill to live again ... through your blood . I need a few seconds to build up the static charge . Your time is up . See almost there . Nice toy , but it can 't harm us . Oh it 's not my intention to harm you . It 's my intention that you face ... whatever final judgment awaits us all . Now Marguerite now ! We don 't want to be set free . We want to live . Challenger ? They 're all being released , all of them . - Don 't make us die again . - Challenger ! He did it . By god he did it Challenger ! Challenger ! Do you want to know where they went ? Who couldn 't ? It 's another of life 's science of mysteries . Now that sounds like the scientist talking . No not at all ... just another human being wondering at the immensity of it all . After all that 's all any of us are . Whether we 're a scientist , a explorer , a journalist ... or an international jewel thief wanted on five continents . Still , at the end of the day , even a king must sometimes stand naked . I never pictured you as an everyman George . You always seemed to have this little air of elitism around you . Well it 's not the end of the day yet is it ? Remember when I told you how much I hated this plateau ? Which time ? Can I let you in on a guilty little secret ? I have been known to have a secret or two , myself . Are you going to share that with our friends ? - And ruin my reputation ? - oh , Marguerite , you know I have heard a little confession is good for the soul . Yeah . So have I ... a very little . *

 Oblongs , Oblongs Down in the valley where a chemical spill Came from the people living up on the Hill There 's a family by the landfill with hazardous foam In their happy glowing home Oblongs Welcome , all , to the opening of firefly season . I 've loved catching fireflies since I was no bigger than a finger puppet . Bob , we haven 't had fireflies in the valley for ages . The air 's too toxic for living things . But this year , we 're supposed to get those new Africanized fireflies . They glow brighter , live longer , and six of them can kill a dog . Yo , Chef Talkie-Too-Much ! Food me ! Okay , who wants a grade-C meat burger ? You can taste the slaughterhouse floor in every bite . How about we start with some ice cream ? Look ! Fireflies ! Hallelujah ! Okay , kids , grab your jars . I 'm gonna catch more than all of you . Bob , while the children are gone I thought we 'd start our own tradition in every room of the house . You 're on your own , kids ! Stay out as late as you want ! Behold . They approach . Mine is gagging . This one 's squirting from both ends . Look . Up in the hills . We can 't go up there . Those are rich people 's fireflies . I think not . Fireflies belong to any man with a spring in his step and a crusty mayonnaise jar . - This is lame . - Yeah , let 's go kill things on computers . - l saw Mom naked ! - What about Dad ? - Finally , we can experience the magic . - Told you he was gay . Hey , valley pukes ! Get your paws off our insects ! I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again , get them ! Oh , crud . They got away . I still have so much pent-up hostility . My therapist says it 's not good to keep that inside . That could lead to transference and acting out . Here . Chuck this through a window . Noble Amistad . Ready to set sail . This time , returning slaves to their homeland . Righting the wrong- - What a night . I could get used to this firefly crap . I hope Biff and Chip weren 't too traumatized by our hot Dutch love . - l see them ! - Scrub your corneas ! I 'm trying ! I guess I 'll go see where that stupid Skippy Henderson left our paper this morning . - Darn you , Skippy ! - Screw you , Mr. Oblong ! Oh , well . Gadzooks ! Boys , were you in the hills last night ? - As you well know , we weren 't . - Much to our disgust . There 's a thing called knocking you might wanna explore . - On the kitchen door ? - Never mind . Milo , were you wreaking havoc in the hills last night ? Moi , reeking ? That , sir , is an insult ! Well , somebody was . What we need is the immediate accuracy of television news . Those valley kids brutalized this gentle soul and destroyed a defenseless slave ship and all the tiny plastic brothers onboard . - I think you mean African-Americans . - Shut up , candy-ass . Now , to deal with these valley hoodlums I 'm appointing a new czar of children 's services . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Mrs. Hubbard . I don 't know her first name . Thank you , mayor . There 's only thing those valley kids need . The good book and what 's inside . Behold ! The piece of the lord . Sorry . I 've got a good feeling about this Mrs. Hubbard . I think things are gonna be okay . - Okay , movie . - Four words . First word . Like Water for Chocolate ! - Yes . - Jeez , Bob could you make it any easier ? Hello. I 'm Czar Hubbard . I 'm visiting all the valley homes . Here 's your complimentary proper-parenting gift basket . Well , thank you . Enjoy your senility . A gift basket ? For us ? Come in , come in . - Care for an Oreo ? - Just the white part . Hi , lady . Your knees is wrinkly . What a doll ! Note to self : Little girl has sprouted horn . So , what 's in the parenting basket , Hubbard ? - l got a Breathalyzer . - l got some saltpeter . - Trade you . - Done . I love nothing more than parenting tips from a barren spinster , but it 's getting late . Just one question before I go . Do you know a Helga Phugly ? No one answers the door at her home . Very suspicious . Helga Phugly ? Nope , never heard of her . I smell a liar . I smell mold . - Helga ? - Why won 't she let us in ? Let me try . Pizza boy . Give it , give it ! That was a dirty trick . We just came by to warn you . Mrs. Hubbard 's asking questions about you . Okay . You warned me . Thanks . Now get out of my vestibule . Helga , why are you acting so weird ? Look , it 's dinner , and my parents are really big on family togetherness time . Goodbye . Don 't let the door hit your butt on the way out . I am so sick of the ass jokes . - She didn 't even offer us a chilled beverage . - See you guys later . I 've got something to do that 's not checking up on Helga . Dinner is delicious , Mom . My day ? It was wonderful . Thanks for asking , Daddy . She 's crazier than I am . Helga , what 's going on ? Where are your parents ? - They 're ... . They 're ... . - They 're where ? They went on vacation a year ago and they never came back ! Your head is really heavy . Come on , Helga , I 'm sure your parents didn 't abandon you . - They 're probably just dead . - What could happen to them ? They just went to the south of France . Oh , I hear that 's quite lovely . How could anybody walk out on an adorable waif like me ? Yeah , anyway , who 's been taking care of you ? No one. I 've been living on unsold wedding cakes from the bakery dumpster next door . I don 't think that 's very healthy . I 'm fine . I eat all the major food colors . Red , white ... . Mostly white . Helga , you can 't live like this . Your roof is leaking , and with all due respect your ass is getting huge . - We gotta tell somebody . - No ! Please , you can 't tell anyone about this . If Mrs. Hubbard finds out , they 'll put me in an orphanage . Okay , but we gotta get this place cleaned up and you can 't just keep eating cake . Don 't worry. I eat other things . Quick ! Get my net ! It 's a juicy , meaty crow . Hi , Dad . Still working on the old project ? Yep. lt 's not easy building an exact replica of the Kon-Tiki . I 've been working on her for 1 7 years but it 'll all be worth it when I sail this baby around the world . - How much have you done ? - So far I 've managed to cut up that pile of wood over there . Wasn 't the Kon-Tiki made of reeds ? Well , I 'll be . Glad we caught this in time . According to Mrs. Hubbard 's manual a family should offer thanks for their meal . Just seeing you all keep it down will be thanks enough for me . Why don 't I just read the prayer in the manual ? " Dear white male god please send down a cleansing fire to rid us of the mud races . " Lordy , this seems just a tad insane . Let 's just eat . I 'm not hungry . I think I 'll take my food somewhere and share it with someone . - Who ? - Gotta go . Bye ! - Milo seems nervous . - And no appetite . He 's like this burnout at school . Crackhead Lenny . Yeah , what a total wastoid . He steals tools from shop , never eats . He 's all sweaty and jittery . - Can he sleep over this weekend ? - Sure . He sounds nice . Thanks for the hot chow , Milo . Your mother should be beaten with an oar . It takes some getting used to . Tell you what. I have a cookbook . You pick up some stuff at the market and I 'll prepare a nutritious dinner for two . And if you 're good , maybe I 'll make you something . It 's a joke ! We both know I don 't eat that much . It feels good to laugh again . Wanna go in the family room and watch TV ? I haven 't fit through that door since I blossomed into a woman . No problem . It 's so nice to have a man around the house . That was fun . What else can 't you fit through ? Fluffy ! My poor little kitty ! I wonder if there 's still marrow in these bones . Only one way to find out ! I 'm worried about our children . When we were growing up , we never even heard of taking drugs . We grew up in the ' 60s . Drugs were everywhere . No , dear , I think you 're wrong . Hi , Dad . Well , that 's alarming . I made some lemonade for my big , strong man . - Thanks . - You look so hot . Why don 't you take your shirt off ? With all the rocks on your lawn , I could lose a nipple . Goodness . You 're giving me the vapors . I 've smelled your vapors . That 's my cue . See you ! Milo , wait ! We never talk anymore . Couldn 't we just sit on the veranda and hold each other ? All right , but no moaning this time ! It gives me the willies . So , what 's going on after school ? Well , there was a murder on my street , and the chalk outline is still there . We can play hopscotch . He already has plans , you ho ! - Easy . - l don 't like you two hussies macking on my man . Oh , no , she didn 't just call me a ho ! Helga , I 'm not your man . I 'm keeping your secret , but you gotta lighten up . You 're gonna leave me , aren 't you ? Everyone I care about leaves me ! Fine. I 'll stay in this loveless relationship out of pity . Oh , goody . That kid 's on opium. I know it . He sneaks out at night . He 's been stealing my tools . Probably building a crystal-meth lab with his biker buddies . You 're buying into this Mrs. Hubbard paranoia . Milo 's a good boy , and the Mongols are my friends . I had to tell somebody . Every time I try to leave , she cries , and it 's not normal tears . They 're all thick and greasy . I can 't believe her parents just left her . I 'm trying to track them on the Internet but I keep getting sidetracked by porn . - Poor Helga . - Poor Helga ? Poor me ! Someone else has to go over there tonight . I 'm whipped , and I don 't even know what that means . I 'd go , but my mom makes me brush her hair until she falls asleep . She 's stealing my childhood . I 'll go , Milo. I 'm sure I can cheer Helga up with my upbeat spirit and concomitant positive energy . Friendship calling ! Hip-hip-hello , Helga ! Milo sent me . He told our secret ? If this is a bad time , I ... . Pickles is right . Milo has too much sense to eat drugs . I 've never seen so much crack ! Oh , well , that tears it ! That 's it ! Party 's over ! Mikey , if you wanna smoke crack , do it at your house . Okay , see you . Milo , no more fooling around . I want you to take me to your drug stash . Okey-doke . Not your prescription drugs . I 'm talking about the bad kind . Dad , there 's enough in there to drop Elvis . is that who your supplier is ? This Elvis ? All right . Bend over . This is gonna hurt me a lot more than it hurts you . That tickles ! Well , I can see you 're too high to feel pain . You just go to your room till you crash or whatever it is you hopheads do . I won 't be ignored , Milo . I really think Milo has gone off the deep end . He should know better than to become a slave to an addictive substance . I think you 're wrong , Bob . I checked Milo thoroughly . The only tracks he has are in his underwear . Oh , Pickles . Anyway , ... I think we need professional help . You did the right thing by calling . We don 't wanna lose another precious little life to drugs . - Jiminy ! - You crazy old buzzard ! Sorry . Reflex . Thank God Milo 's not here . He 's probably out huffing roofies at some rave . I know where he is , but it 's gonna cost you . Cost you absolutely nothing . Nobody move . Don 't shoot , or I 'll kiss him again ! She 's not bluffing ! She 'll do it ! Her lips are like sharkskin . Sweetie , thank God you 're okay ! And you 're not a junkie head . You 're under arrest for kidnapping , little girl . Cuff her , J.J. I 'm trying , sheriff . Wait , you can 't arrest her . Her parents abandoned her . - She just needs love . - What she needs is a salad . I 'm sorry you 're in jail , Helga . Unfortunately , they 're going to try you as an adult based on your weight . They say they might drop the charges if they could find my parents . Can you give us any clues about where they might be ? Well , the last time they sent me money some of it was red , and some of it was blue . Great , they must be in Candyland . Well , that 's just silly , dear . They don 't have money in Candyland . It 's a barter system . They 'd probably send her gumdrops or maybe candy canes . - My poor baby . - Phugly . - You made bail . - My parents ! They must 've come back ! Mommy ! - You bailed her out ? - That 's right . I 've decided to adopt her . I wanna give her a nice home and raise her self-esteem . Lord , cleanse this vile heathen of her wicked , disgusting ways . I really don 't like where this is going . Let 's get the hell out of here . We can 't let Helga be adopted by that shriveled old lunatic . Maybe another family could adopt her . - How about us ? - No ! I mean , no . I 'd prefer not to . Maybe Mrs. Hubbard will make a good mother to Helga . She did write this wonderful parenting manual . Oh , Bob , that thing 's a load of crap . Parenting isn 't about suspicion . It 's about love and nurturing and manipulation . You can 't learn that from a book . I think the good people at Publish Yourself Publications might disagree with you . Afternoon , brothers and sisters . Care to make a donation ? We 're sending Bibles into space . I 'm teaching Helga how to proselytize . She 's learning how to turn tricks ? Hey , nobody 's soiling my future daughter , long as she 's wearing this baby . The " Forni-Guard 2000 " ? I 'm wearing one too . You really think you need that ? There 's a lot of immigrants out there . - Helga , do you want her to adopt you ? - Oh , yes . I like sharing a bed with Mother H. is that graffiti on your eyes ? - What ? - Gotta go ! Space needs bibles . Good lord . That old biddy is nuts . Bob , she 's still here . Mom , we 've gotta stop this ! Don 't worry. I 've got an idea . No judge will give custody of a child to an unfit mother . Beat that , Chuck Heston . What the devil ? I 'm sorry . This will be over in a sec . It 's to embarrass you . That 's it ! Work it , baby ! Oh , you 're a bad boy , aren 't you ? All right , now lose the thong ! No . That 's enough . Sorry . My whip. lt 's a rental . I agree . This is some pretty sick smut but what does it have to do with this case ? - Pickles , these are all of me ! - l 'm sorry , baby . You just looked like such a tasty snack . And this was taken during my bath time ! Does anyone else have anything to add before I make my decision ? Your Honor , I request that we be granted custody of Helga and allowed to raise her in a ramshackle tree house without electricity or toilet facilities . You know , hearing it out loud , it 's not sounding so good . Respectfully withdrawn . I 've reached a decision . Custody of the Phugly girl is hereby granted to Mrs. Hubbard . Wait ! You 're out of order ! And you 're out of order ! And you 're out of order ! This whole damn court 's out of order ! - What are you blabbering about ? - Sorry , I 'm not quite right . Your Honor , I found Helga 's real parents . Helga , darling . Mommy ! Daddy ! Where have you been ? On our way home from Europe , our plane crashed on an ice floe . All search parties had given up but thanks to the Internet queries of this noble , melon-headed boy-child we were rescued not 24 hours ago . Oh , Helga , we were determined to make it back to you even when the food ran out and we were forced to eat all the other passengers . - That must 've been horrible ! - Oh , you can 't imagine . Helga , I brought you a necklace of their teeth . Nice . Now , that 's a good parent . Helga Phugly , I leave you to the care of your mother and father . Thanks , Milo . You made us a family again . Hey , it 's my job. I 'm a kid . Let 's go home , sweetie . I 'm so happy to see you . Yeah , you look good enough to eat . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

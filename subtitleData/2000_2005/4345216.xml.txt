 Shit ! Hey , handle with care . That 's a billion dollars worth of Uncle Sam 's money . Yeah , tell me about it . Trying again . Damn it . All right , Neil , I think the idea is to catch the satellite . Yeah , very funny . I 've got a big problem here . Neil , talk to me . The arm 's acting up . Server controls are out of phase . Shoulder pitch is completely locked up . Houston , this is Odyssey . We have an arm that 's malfunctioning ... resulting in a minor collision with the payload . Over . Roger , Odyssey . We 're reassessing ground track , reviewing increment 2 contingency . We recommend you carry out arm 's diagnostic error routine 3S . Also suggest you review ACU test assessment profile . Over . Roger , Houston . Satellite 's picked up a wobble . Definitely in for a hangover come sunup . Double pitch is seriously over ramp . Houston , re-requesting a trouble-shooting procedure ... Switching to back-up controls . Come back , Odyssey . Did not read you . Over . I am go with back-up controls . Odyssey , come in . Over . Odyssey , come in . Over . Heading for the dance floor . Odyssey , come in . Over . All right , Houston , we are switching to back-up . We 're gonna take another crack at this . Odyssey , we strongly advise you wait for trouble-shooting . This is not procedure check . It is today , Ed . Over . Closer . Closer . Do it . Do it , baby . Why does everything that comes out of your mouth have something to do with sex ? Maybe because we 're riding in a $ 3 billion phallic symbol . Don 't quote me . If I started quoting you , they 'd shut down the space programme . Closer . Oh , baby , put it in . Yeah ! Come on . Come on . Vive I 'amour . Hey , to the greatest catch since Drew Pearson , Super Bowl 10 . Here , here . Here , here . Hey , this tastes like the real thing . Dom ' 98 . Got something going with one of the girls in food processing . Yeah . The thought that our nutritional requirements are being determined ... by your sexual dalliances doesn 't exactly leave me brimming with confidence . Speaking of a lack of confidence ... I don 't need to remind you that I am putting you on live TV . You make me look bad , I 'm flushing you out the airlock . Not to worry , darling . I promise you a dignified exchange . But now that we 're on the subject of the airlock ... did you know that oxygen depletion enhances the effect of sexual stimulant ... I don 't really want to know that . Copy that crew assignment change . This is your call , Chuck . Whatever you wanna do is okay by me . He 's your son . Over . Well , there 's something to be said for enthusiasm , Ed ... but he should have waited and he knows it . You just don 't wanna have to be the one to tell your wife . On the subject of wives , I think I smell those cookies from here , Ed . What did Bernice make you this time ? Peanut butter macadamia . Damn , I 'm jealous . Ask her if she 'll make up a plate of those things for me . You better be standing by the door waiting with them when I touch down . - You hear me ? - I 'll be sure and do that . Thanks , Ed . Odyssey , out . You know , I 've spent my life jumping one hurdle after another ... trying to get where I am , but parenting ... Not even sure I qualify for that event . Oh , hell , you qualify . You just got to step up . Or like my daddy used to say , " Get three down and locked . " Three down and locked . Houston , translation manoeuvre complete . She 's back in the pipeline . Over . Roger , Odyssey . You 're looking fine . Over . Gonna run diagnostics on the arm before the interview . Neil , I wanna change the crew assignment . When the satellite 's refitted , I want Matt to execute the redeployment . Matt . Yeah . He 's got more time on the arm . We had a malfunction . I need someone with a little more experience . Why are you doing this ? Neil , you 're smart and you 're quick . But this time you 're too quick . When that arm goes down , you wait for Houston to relay proper troubleshooting . That 's procedure . You know there wasn 't enough time . That satellite had a wicked ... - That was not your call . - You let me go ahead with the capture . I let you go ahead with the capture ... 'cause in this set of circumstances you happened to be right . I see . So you 're pulling me ' cause I was right . If you 'd have been wrong , you 'd have screwed the pooch ... and we 'd have a billion-dollar satellite floating up to Pluto along with your career . If you fuck up , you do not get a second chance , Son . If you 'd have lost that satellite , you 'd be back in Houston next week ... looking for work as a bartender . Now this ain 't easy for me . I bet . What 's that supposed to mean ? It means having me up here instead of Marc . I have work to do . Earlier today , some of the astronauts ' families ... turned out at a rally to raise money for muscular dystrophy . We spoke with Troy Johnson , husband of Sarah Forbes ... and Paige Taggart , wife of Shuttle Commander , Chuck Taggart ... and mother of astronaut Neil Taggart . Well , all the attention can get overwhelming . But I just try and take it one day at a time . I just try and be the best wife and mother I can be . My wife is the first journalist in outer space . I couldn 't be prouder . Hey , Sarah , if you 're listening , I love you , babe . Is it hard for you , as a shuttle commander , having your son on the crew ? Well , as a flight commander , you have to make many adjustments ... and I just treat Neil as another gifted astronaut . I try to forget that he 's my son . Neil ? I guess I just have to echo that . I think of him as my commander and try to forget that he 's my dad . Dr Kurt Mendel , Nobel Prize-winning behavioural geneticist ... and author of several best-selling science books ... is hitching a ride to the International Space Station ... where he 'll be overseeing a series of experiments . Dr Mendel , would you care to explain the specifics of the work you 'll be doing ? Well , Sarah , the thrust of my work ... will be to erect a series of hard protocols ... designed to penetrate the ins and outs ... of zero-G environment on DNA sequencing . Hopefully , it would all come together . Thank you , Doctor . My pleasure , Sarah . This is Sarah Forbes reporting to you live from the space shuttle . You 're a dead man ! You 're a dead man ! What 'd I say ? I answered the question . - Too right . - Hey , we just lost video . Maybe it 's the monitor connection . Matt . Maybe the uplink 's gone sour . Nah , the whole damn thing 's down . Smells like a TIGRIS malf . No , the connections look solid . Control , this is Odyssey . Do you read ? Over . - Could be the switching unit . - No . Audio 's dead , too . Houston , this is Odyssey , come in . Houston , this is Odyssey , come in . Over . Houston ... What the hell ? Is that coming from Earth ? Okay , everybody , get to the crew compartment . Now . Let 's move it ! I 'll stow the camera and secure the hatch . On the double , all right ? Oh , my God ! Shit ! Matt ! Matt ! Shut the hatch ! - I can 't get to you ! - You 'll lose the ship ! Do it , now ! Chuck ! What the fuck are you doing ? Open the fucking hatch ! Chuck ! Come on ! Chuck ! Bastard ! Houston . Houston , come in . Houston , come in , over . Houston , this is Odyssey . Come in , over . Houston . This is Odyssey . Come in . Houston . Houston . This is Odyssey . Come in , over . What the fuck 's going on ? I can 't find the Earth . Houston . Houston , this is Odyssey . Over . I 'm not getting tach , Dad . Now look , we can 't worry about it now . Kurt , how 's Angela doing ? Possible concussion . - Where 's the checklist ? - How serious ? - Serious enough . - And I need a checklist for the thruster link . To hell with the checklist . The shit can 't EOMS . Kurt , give me a straight answer , God damn it ! - He said she had a concussion , Taggart . - What the fuck is going on ? - Neil . - Where the fuck are we ? - Listen ... - Where is the fucking Earth ? Just shut up , god damn it ! Now get a hold of yourself and listen to me . Get the goddamn headset on . We 've gotta get hold of the ship , see , Son . Just maintain and open up that computer and go through this check with me . Houston , this is Odyssey . Over . Come in . Maybe one of the fuel tanks ruptured and maybe that 's what put us where we are . And where is that exactly ? On the other side of the moon maybe and maybe the Earth is behind it . Do you have any idea of the amount of thrust a little trip like that would take ? Sorry , folks , we haven 't moved , not even a few miles anyway . Houston , this is Odyssey . Over . Houston ... No , that 's not possible . Houston , are you hearing me in ? Come in . Over . That 's not possible . Houston , come ... What is so funny ? It just occurred to me this is one scenario ... NASA really forgot to programme into the simulators . Kurt , get down to the avionics bay . I wanna run a complete systems check . Another procedure in the junior shuttle commander 's handbook , Chuckie ? - Knock it off . - Refresh my memory . Which procedure gives you licence to blast a crew member into outer space ? This ain 't a goddamn democracy , Kurt . Get down to the avionics bay . What for ? Planning to flush me out like Matt ? Oh , God ! Fire in FD Bay 1 . Arm auto-extinguisher , now ! Activate auto-extinguisher , now ! Shit ! Didn 't do a goddamn thing . See it , Dad . It 's the bay . On four , three , two , one , push ! Move it ! One , two , three ! Hit it . Keep it up ! Keep it up ! Yeah . That smoke 's gonna be a bitch of a problem . - What are you doing ? - I 'm killing the optic sub-system . That recycles the oxygen . The fire took out the lithium hydroxide canisters . All of them ? - Except the two already installed . - Lithium hydroxide ? They remove carbon dioxide from the air . - We got enough air for 12 hours . - Yeah , but with all the smoke ... The system has to filter out the smoke , so you cut that down to three . Three hours ? We can 't live on these . They last only 45 minutes . - I 've gotta get the smoke out of here . - How 'll you do that ? I 'm gonna depressurise the entire ship . What are we supposed to do ? Hold our breath ? Neil and I 'll climb into the EFUs . The rest of you get into the personal rescue enclosure . I 'd like to raise an issue . What 's the point of all this ? - To stay alive . - For an extra nine hours ? - It 's better than nothing . - Is it ? Nine more hours to sit around and wait for the oxygen to run out . We can 't just give up , Kurt . Look out the window ! Earth is not on the mission programme . If ever there was a time to give up , this is it ! I say we bag this routine and get it over with ! I wanna live , even if it is only for nine hours . Why ? You want another interview ? - God damn it , Kurt ! - Would you cut it out ? It takes 20 minutes to get into the suits , 15 to clear the vent . We cannot stand around and argue . Neil 's right . Take out the EMUs . Son , take care of the personal rescue enclosures . Well , I am gonna depressurise this cabin ... and you can get into an enclosure if you want to ... or you can sit here and twiddle your thumbs while you decompress . But if that 's your choice , do me a favour ... and get your ass in a sleeping bag and zip the fucker up ... because I do not wish to spend my last living hours cleaning up the mess . Why the change of heart ? Well , I always had a secret desire to be a Christmas tree ornament . Neil , what 's your status ? Neil , what 's your status ? Over . Ready . Closing console . Opening cabin vents . Whoa . Our shepherd , the Lord , hallowed be Thy name . Come on , baby . Hold , hold , hold . Come on , baby . And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . Oh , God , please don 't let me fart . Closing cabin vents . Opening lights . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you , darling . I love you . Oh , God ! What ? Yummy . You can join in at any time . Yes , I just don 't have that gene , darling . Sure sounded like you did when I opened that recovery enclosure . A slip of the tongue . Doesn 't give you much comfort , does it , not believing in an afterlife ? On the contrary , it gives me lots of comfort . How can the prospect of non-existence be comforting ? I look at it like this . Before I came on stage ... the universe had been around for 12 billion years . All that time , I was in a state of non-existence , and it wasn 't bad . Pretty comfortable , as a matter of fact . I figure it 'll be just as comfortable for the next 12 billion years . So all of those people are wrong who believe in a higher power . Look what good it did them . What 's that ? It 's my comfort . He died six months after that picture was taken . - Of what ? - Cancer . - I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . He 's what I 've got to look forward to . He and Troy , my husband , my second husband . My first marriage died not too long after my son . Two husbands in afterlife could get pretty stormy . Yeah , I know . So strange . When NASA invited me on this mission ... one of the reasons I accepted was because I thought it would bring me closer to God ... and my little boy . Guess I 'm gonna get my wish . I 'm sorry about what I said earlier . About Marc . Forget it . Why do you think he left ? God , man . Well , you know ... I know why . He left because he didn 't want to be ... what he could 've been ... what I wished he could 've been . So he left . You wanna kill that auxiliary power unit . I don 't think we need it anymore . Yeah . Sure . Doesn 't anybody want to say anything ? I need to use the john . Okay , come on . We 're wasting oxygen . Hey . Remember during training when I invited you up to my apartment ? You told me maybe if I was the last man on Earth . Well ? Sarah ? - Neil . Neil . - Yeah ? Neil . We 've touched down . Neil . We touched down . - You awake ? - Yeah . We touched down somewhere . - Excuse me . - Hello . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , we 're alive . We 're alive . I wouldn 't jump to any conclusions . Is this heaven ? Hear that ? If it 's heaven , it 's run by machines . If it 's heaven , I hope they serve coffee . This gravity is playing hell with the structural damage . We better evacuate before this thing comes down on our heads . How do we know it 's any better out there ? Well , I 'll tell you in a minute . Well , we should throw something out first . Dad , that 's definitely not procedure . Let 's evacuate . - I guess I should 've expected it . - What ? God is an old , white guy . It 's probably an artificial construct ... so we won 't freak out , derived from TV transmissions . - How do you know that ? - Three hundred hours of Star Trek . You 're all alive . It means I got the atmosphere right . It 's English , isn 't it ? Yeah , we speak English . For a second I thought I had it wrong . Now , who the hell are you ? I 'm the last remaining inhabitant of my world . As for my name , in my culture , we didn 't use names ... in the same way your culture did . We identified ourselves by our life purpose ... which I suppose makes me The Seeker . - Where are we ? - You 're aboard my ship . The same concept as that baby over there ... only , with about 5,000 years of technology behind it . Do you know what happened to the Earth ? I do , indeed . The same thing that happened to my world . Same thing that happened to over 50 other worlds . Destroyed . Everything gone . How ? Why ? That 's the big mystery . Three hundred years ago ... I was sent on a quest to locate other civilisations . But wherever I went , there was only dust . When I returned to my home world , I found the same . I 've been searching the galaxy ever since . I pick up radio signals . I follow them to their source . But when I arrive , the source is always gone ... and I 'm always too late . Like this time ? Yes and no . You five are the only survivors from a sundered world ... that I 've ever run into . Because of that , there is still a chance to save your world . But the Earth is gone . I have it in my power to project you back . Project us back ? - Time travel . - Sort of . Physical time travel doesn 't work . Mathematically impossible . Your bodies can 't go back . What you think of as your consciousness can . Our souls . Well , we 're really talking about information patterns . I can take your current patterns ... and download them into your physical selves of the past . How far past ? The jump limit is around five of your years . That should give you enough time . - But enough time ... - Enough time to stop it . To stop the destruction . If you can do that for us , why don 't you send yourself back ? Only organics can jump . Then are you what I think you are ? - What can you do for her ? - She only has about two minutes . - What do you need to send us back ? - All I need is the word . If there 's a chance in heaven to prevent this , then do it , man . - What are we supposed to be looking for ? - I can tell you this . The destroyers attack from within . She 's losing her pulse . She 's losing her pulse . I can retrieve her information . You can still go back . - Then do it . - What are you talking about ? You can 't let him do that . - Do it now ! - You don 't know who he is or what he does . I don 't give a goddamn who he is ! Do it now . Seek within your own . Seek within your own . Oh , God . What 's the matter ? I 'm home . Of course you 're home . You had a nightmare ? Come on . We gotta get up early tomorrow . Hi . Neil . Chuck . Neil . This is Marc 's room . What is wrong with you ? Where 's Neil ? You 're scaring me , Chuck . - Where is he ? - You know where he is . I 've never seen anybody just drop like that . It 's creepy . Where am I ? Kayley ? That would be me . And I 'm Wade . This is your other very close friend , Diaz . This is a party ? - Yeah , man , this is a party . - Yeah . Wade , I 'm in junior year . Have you been taking any prescription medication we should know about ? I gotta use the phone . Oh , my God . Oh , God . Oh , God , Troy . Oh , my God . Troy ? - Paul ? - Yeah . You were expecting somebody else ? No ! I 'm back . - You 're back ? - Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Paul , I 'm back . Oh , my God . I 'm back . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . That 's the last time we have Mexican food after 9 : 00 p.m. Now tell me , who 's Troy anyways ? Sarah ? Baby , it 's Mommy . - Baby . - I 'm sleeping . I 'm sorry , baby . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , God . Oh , my God ! Oh , my baby . Oh , God . Where are you ? Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I 'm at a party . - A party ? - A party ? Dad , we 're back . We 're really back . This is incredible . Yeah , I know , Neil . Where 's this party ? I don 't know . Oh , my God . It 's at the Fishers ' . Okay . Stay right there . I 'll be right over . Where are the car keys , honey ? You are supposed to be at Wade 's house studying for an exam . Mom ? Yeah ... Gosh , Mom , I 'm really sorry . You have no idea how sorry you 're going to be . Keys , keys . - What are you going to do about your son ? - My son ? Why is he always my son ? He 's your son , too . I can 't believe he 's almost 18 . Neither can I. - Where are the car keys ? - Where you always leave them . Birdcage . Guess you never thought you 'd be glad to see me . How 'd you guess ? 'Cause I was thinking the same thing about you . - Chuck ? - This is ... Hi , you must be Mrs Taggart . I 'm Kurt Mendel . - I 'm an old buddy of Chuck 's . - College . College . College . So what brings you out here this time of night ? We 've got a big problem . I 've got a big problem . My car broke down about a mile back . L ... - Thought I 'd take you to the gas station . - That 's right . - No problem . I 'll be right back . - What about Neil ? I 'll pick him up on the way back . One second she 's in the Odyssey 's cockpit ... the next second she 's on a spacewalk five years ago . She doesn 't know anything about the Earth being destroyed . The time jumble , The Seeker . The shit of it is she was injured when she was projected back . There 's no goddamn telling what kind of condition she 's in now . - Chuck ! - Ed . - What the hell is going on ? - We gotta talk . Easy now . Take it slow , fella . - Talk to who ? And who is this ? - Dr Kurt Mendel . He 's with me . - Lf we can talk to her , we can save her . - Now hold on ... No , I 'm not done , you bull-headed son of a bitch . We talk to her , we can save her . If we don 't , she dies . You hear me ? She dies . Angela , this is Joe . Do you read ? Over . Angela , this is Joe . Do you read ? She 's using up fuel like crazy . Another few seconds , she 's in the atmosphere . You better give me a goddamn procedure ... or I 'm gonna burn the OMS and bring her in with the arm . I don 't care how close we are to the atmosphere . Discovery , this is control . Go hot air-to-air and activate XMIT-PTT . Over . Roger , Control . Out . What are you gonna do , give her a pep talk ? Flight Officer Perry , this is Chuck Taggart . Over . Taggart ? Please respond . Over . Flight Officer Perry , take control of the MMU and return to orbiter now . Over . Shit . Angela , this is your mission commander , Chuck Taggart . Now I 'm ordering you to look alive ... get hold of that goddamn man-manoeuvring unit ... and get your ass back to that ship , now ! Over . Angela ! Angela . - She 's responding . - Matt . Have we met ? No . I guess not . I 'm sorry . I thought you were someone else . Okay , Chuck , I am ordering Discovery to intercept . No , you can 't do that , Ed . The ship gets anywhere nearer to that atmosphere , it 'll turn to a ball of fire . Angela ... get three down and lock . Listen to me . Get three down and lock . Angela , like your daddy always said , get three down and lock , honey . - That is it . I am giving the command . - She 's too close to the atmosphere . If we send them in , we could lose the ship . I 'm the flight director here , and I will make the call ! Do you understand ? Listen . This is Flight ... Flight Officer Perry . I read you , Houston . Come on . Come on . Control , this is Discovery . She 's coming home . Girls . - Has he had trouble eating ? - No . - Gastric distress of any kind ? - No . Can I ask you why you think Corey might need this type of examination ? My family has a history of cancer , and my father died of it . He was well into his 70s , if I remember correctly . He was 75 . Sarah , stomach cancer in a child Corey 's age is extremely rare . I realise that . I just would like to get him checked out . I mean , if you won 't do it , I 'll just go someplace that will . I see . I 'll do a complete physical right now ... and I 'll make an appointment at the hospital for x-rays . - You can get those ... - Today . We 'll schedule it for this afternoon . Thank you . Oh , God . ... told reporters this afternoon ... I could still smell it on his clothes this morning . He was smoking pot . We need to do something about this , Chuck . ... sufficient free breathing time before embarking on the space walk . Before leaving the shuttle ... Hi , this is Sarah . I can 't get to the phone right now ... but please leave a message after the beep . Oh , Jesus . Could I have your attention , please ? Yeah , honey . I 'll talk to him . He needs more than a talk . Who are you calling ? Do I have to go back to the doctor today ? He 's just gonna take some pictures of you , honey . You wanna paint ? Okay . There 's your painting . Hello , Sarah . This is Chuck Taggart . Please call me at 555-0175 . Hello , Sarah . This is Chuck Taggart again . Please ... What 're you doing , honey ? That 's really nice , honey . - Who 's Sarah Forbes ? - Sarah Forbes , honey , is a reporter . And ? And she just wants to talk to me about this thing that I have with Angela . Since when do you care so much about talking to reporters ? Hello . Don 't call me anymore . - Sarah . - I can 't be a part of this . Sarah , you are a part of this . Sarah ? For the record , we were four years , 319 days , and seven hours ... from where we were before . Which gives us exactly four years , 319 days , and seven hours ... to stop what 's happened from happening . Sorry . Hello ? Tova . Yeah . Well , the reason I called you was to let you know that the wedding 's off . Yeah . You heard me right . I know you 're not with your parents , Tova . You 're in Skirkie with Steve . Well , that 's for me to know , and you to find out . In the meantime , I want you and your crap out of my apartment by tomorrow night . Thank you . Bye . - I think I just saved myself a ton in alimony . - Yeah , Kurt ... you wanna do the world a favour and shit-can that cell phone for two minutes ? It 's on vibrate . You all right behind those glasses , Neil ? Yeah , good , because this four years is gonna pass like a fucking heartbeat ... unless we stand smartly . So listen up . The Seeker said , " Seek within your own , look within your own . " What the hell was that ? Maybe he meant that whoever destroyed the Earth looks just like us . Well , that narrows it down to six billion people . I 'll take North America . - We don 't have much to go on , do we ? - Maybe we do . That NADCOM satellite we deployed wasn 't a communications satellite . - What ? - The NADCOM designation was just a cover . A cover for what ? Something that came down through the agency 's Special Projects Division . The most I could figure out it was some sort of orbital physics experiment . Code name was Bright Sky . - Jesus . It was the feds , wasn 't it ? - Yeah . - They used us , didn 't they ? - Yeah . Orbital physics experiment ? What the fuck is that ? Hell , if I know , baby . I 'm just paid to hang them up in space . My clearance doesn 't go that far , but I 'll tell you this . When we were drifting , right before we ran out of oxygen ... I searched the back-up COMSES file . There was a ground to air S-band transmission ... sent to that satellite a nanosecond before the Earth exploded . Now it was a programming code , and I was able to decipher one word . Leviathan . The good news is we don 't have to go off searching for any more destroyers . - They 're sitting right here at this table . - You don 't know that . He does . Goddamn decent of you to let us in on your little secret , Chuckie . You don 't really expect us to buy into the " I wasn 't in the loop " bullshit , do you ? Kurt , do you hear that noise ? That 's me giving a shit about what you believe or not . That 's good , 'cause I think you 're a fucking liar . - Hey , come on . - Let 's not do this . - My thoughts exactly . - Kurt . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna spend the next five years getting drunk . Bye . Kurt . Kurt . Jesus Christ . No sign of compromised blood flow whatsoever . We 're looking at 80 % revascularisation minimum . Times like this , I think we should stock champagne . So , look , Doc , the season 's starting up and all ... and all the fellows are bugging me to get back on the lanes again . I don 't care if the Pope flies in and hands you the papal bowling ball . We talked about this , Gerald . I want you to refrain from all physical activity ... for another six weeks , Mr Wilkerson . Don 't worry , Doctor . His bowling days are over . I 'll see you next week . - Bright Sky ? - Yeah . I never heard of it . You say it 's coming down from Special Projects ? Yeah . Well , how 'd you hear about it ? I opened up some screwball e-mail . I thought it was from a college sweetheart . And on the whole it just turns out to be a bust ... but in it , it listed every single thing I just told you plus which at the end of it ... there 's some goddamn foreboding warning ... that some future mission is gonna be endangered . - That 's a prank . - Maybe . It 's gotta be . It 's some wiseass over in data processing . I 'm telling you , I wouldn 't give you two shits for the college boys they 're hiring today . You know , if memory serves , right before Challenger ... we had a bunch of anonymous e-mails , didn 't we ? Come on , Chuck . Don 't bring that one up . Look , Ed , you know , I 'm sorry I got a bug up my ass about this thing ... but if it 's nothing , it 's nothing . There 's no harm done . But if it 's something , it 's better we check it out rather than crash and burn . What the hell is going on around here anyway ? One of the best pilots in the rotation completely loses it ... in the middle of a routine EVA ? You come flying in out of the blue and talk her down . I still don 't know how . As we used to say in the old glory days , it beats flipping burgers , doesn 't it ? Ed , I wouldn 't ask you this if it wasn 't important . Well ... I 'm not going through channels . I don 't want anyone to know I 'm poking around . I 'll use the back door at great risk to my career . I appreciate that , pal . And I 'm sorry I called you a bull-headed son of a bitch . No . The mutual funds , too . And I want it all in cash . Larry , Larry , Larry . Yeah , I know I 'm taking a big hit . Just make it happen , okay ? Believe me , I know what I 'm doing . Thanks . Bye . Horse racing ? Football . Lost my house first go around . Not this time . - Drink ? - No . Thanks . Your door was open . I don 't see much point in shutting it , I guess . Place looks bigger . Well , personally , I think she took a little more than her stuff . To what do I owe the pleasure ? I was in the neighbourhood and realised I never thanked you for saving my life . Chuckie got through to you . He 's who you need to thank . Yeah , well , he told me you were the one that sounded the alarm , so ... Just spend the next five years wisely . Take up smoking , eat plenty of red meat and dairy products . Practise loads of unsafe sex . - Is that what you plan to do ? - Well , for starters . Mainly , I plan to get insanely rich , followed by obscenely rich . What 's the point if nothing will be here in five years ? Well , he who dies with the most toys ... Maybe we don 't have to die at all . Maybe that 's why we survived . Maybe we 're here for a reason . I don 't believe anything happens for a reason . Come on . If you can make a killing on a football game ... it means we can change the way things go . How about we change the way things went ? How do you live with yourself ? Well , no one else will , so I might as well . Let 's say we do manage to stop the world from blowing up in five years . Look around you , Angela . Is that really such a great accomplishment ? I wish I could say you had changed , Kurt . But the funny thing is , you 're exactly the same . And that 's the problem . And that 's the KNBS News for this afternoon . Join us for the action edition at 6 : 00 p.m. Urban asthma . Are you at risk ? Our very own Dr Mac will bring you up to speed . KNBS Action News , investigative and hard-hitting . - When were you gonna tell me ? - Tell you what ? That you 're taking our son in for cancer screenings . - How 'd you find out ? - Dr Egrari called . You told me that Corey was coming down with a cold . You lied to me . The tests were all negative . Well , you sound disappointed . Egrari said that you were taking Corey to see a specialist for more tests . - That 's right . - What 's going on ? Dr Egrari 's worried , but not about Corey . She 's worried about you . She 's using words like obsessive-compulsive . She 's even mentioned something called Munchausen 's Syndrome by Proxy . - Do you know what that is ? - Might have heard of it . It 's when a parent tries to draw attention to themselves ... by claiming that their child has a serious illness . Dr Egrari said sometimes parents will even induce these symptoms in their children ... - just to get people to believe them ! - I would never hurt Corey . Come here . The other night when I had that nightmare ... I dreamt that Corey got cancer . Jesus . I watched him waste away , Paul . I watched his hair fall out . I watched him get so thin that he couldn 't stand up . And I held him in my arms , and he stopped breathing . And it was so real . It was so real . I just have to make sure . I have to make sure . Sweetheart ! Hey , Mom . It 's good to have you here . Neil . Hey . Hey , Dad . Marc . This is awesome , Mom . If I have one more helping of chipped beef ... Ham tender enough ? Well , any more tender and I wouldn 't have to chew . The Andersons are having a get-together on Saturday night . We thought you should come along . I was planning on hanging out with some of the guys on Saturday . John Stiles will be there . He just got a seat on the astronaut selection panel . Honey , can you pass me some more corn , please ? Don 't you think it would be a good idea if Marc were there ? I think it 'd be a good idea for Marc to do whatever the hell he wants to . If he wants to hang out with his friends . He can see his friends any time . They 're not going anywhere . Well , John Stiles isn 't going anywhere , either . - Chuck . - Mom . It 's okay . I 'll be there . I 'll just go with the guys on Friday night . Now we 're gonna meet the woman ... who 's gonna choose one of these three guys as her date . To prevent her from hearing anything about these guys ... we 've kept her isolated backstage . - Hello ? - Gerald Wilkerson , please . Gerald ! Phone call for you ! Yeah , this is Gerald . Where are you going ? Bowling . You 're not leaving this house . Gerald Wilkerson . I want that bowling ball . I said give me that ! Never touch my bowling ball again . Don 't wait up . This interception on a third-quarter bomb ... just may have made the difference here today . And there 's Joe Anthony to throw to Weaver . Weaver taking it to the 35-yard line . I can 't believe you 're so relaxed . I am not anything but relaxed . You 're about to lose so much money on this game . - Bet you an hour 's worth I don 't . - You 're on . Oh , boy . And the hand-off to Duckett . Duckett runs right up the middle . - Fumble . - Fumble ! He dropped the ball ! Hey , how 'd you know that was gonna happen ? I know many things , darling . Michigan with no more time outs , so Coon has been summoned . Seconds winding down in this game ... It will hang left and squeak through . Just like me , darling . There 's the snap . And it bounces off the upright . It 's no good . Just listen to that crowd . This breaks an unbelievable point ... for Coon who failed four of his last field goal attempts . A very ... Wow . You 're sure relaxed now . A crushing moment . Hey , Bobby . Checking out for tonight . See you tomorrow . The President assured the Senate Subcommittee on Thursday ... that he would make the pursuit of the tax cheats a top priority . In other news , an automobile accident has claimed the life of Ed Scrivens ... the veteran NASA flight director ... of over 50 shuttle missions . The accident took place late last night ... as Scrivens was on his way home from work . NASA officials described themselves ... as stunned and saddened by the death ... Don 't ever forget that . I sort of wish he could 've gone up with us . He always wanted to go , just once . Ed was never one for regrets . He was just so happy that you were up there in his place . Listen , Bernice ... if you need anything at all , please don 't hesitate to call us . Honey , I 'm gonna hang around and talk to some people . I 'll take Neil with me . Are you sure ? Yeah . I 'll see you and Marc back at the house . Come in . Hi . - How are you feeling ? - About the same . Don 't let it get cold . Come on . Come on , come on . - Mrs Wilkerson ? - Yes . My name is Chuck Taggart . This is Angela Perry . We 're friends of Ed Scrivens . We 'd like to talk to you if you 'd be so kind to give us a moment of your time . I 'm sorry . I really don 't have the time right now . Wait . Mrs Wilkerson . We know you 've been reluctant to talk ... - Excuse me . - Wait ! We understand that Mr Scrivens ' firm was preparing a lawsuit against ... We 're not here to talk about any of that . We 're just trying to understand what happened to our friend . Please . Just one moment . Please . News special ? Yes . Medical breakthroughs of the new millennium . It 's a series we 're running for sweeps . I 'm Sarah Forbes of CNT . This is Dr Mendel , my research advisor . Dr Kurt Mendel , the author . I read one of your books a while back . Can 't remember if I liked it . Not to worry . I probably don 't remember writing it . As I was saying , you 've caught me at a very bad time . We 're having a serious situation with our computer system . - What happened ? - Virus , we think . Chewed into everything . Got into the back-ups . It 'll be two weeks before we know the extent of the damage . I just hope to God we haven 't lost everything . All of your patients ' files were on the computer ? Lost records are the least of our problems . - I 'm sure Dr Mendel can explain it to you . - I understand one of your patients ... was recently involved in an automobile accident ? I still can 't believe it myself . How long have you been conducting these trials ? I 'm sorry . I really have to get back to work . Why don 't you call my office and set up an appointment ? We 'll do that . Flash a spotlight in his eyes next time , why don 't you ? What 'd I do ? About a year ago ... Gerald came down with this medical condition . A blockage in his arteries . Doctors thought he was going to die . When we signed up for this free programme at Houston General ... The gene therapy trials ? - One of the newspapers mentioned it . - I see . Well , these gene treatments ... they saved Gerald 's life . But ... What , Mrs Wilkerson ? After the treatments began ... Gerald started to change . Change ? How did he change ? Well , he just wasn 't the same respectful man I married . Dr Barantz , he was overseeing the treatments ... he claimed that the medication Gerald was taking could affect his mood . But this was more than that . Sometimes it was like there was somebody else inside my husband 's body . One night ... I woke up . It was late , after 1 : 00 , and Gerald was gone . He didn 't get home till after 4 : 00 a.m. I asked him where he was , but he wouldn 't talk about it . Just got angry . This went on for three nights . I know what you 're thinking , but Gerald wasn 't having an affair . It was something else . Mrs Wilkerson , what else ? I don 't know . Mrs Wilkerson ... this is very , very important . One night I followed him in my car . He drove to this old storage warehouse just outside of town . There were people waiting for him . Men and women . At first , I didn 't recognise them . Then I realised who they were . Who ? They were the other people in the trials . The other patients . Oh , shit . Shit ! It was a virus . Self-replicating , polymorphic worm . Built-in suicide string . Once it sucked up everything on my hard drive , it erased itself . And you caught this from Ed 's workstation ? Whatever he found out , it 's worm food . Dr Barantz 's computer system has a virus . Sounds like someone 's trying to cover their tracks . What does Ed Scrivens ' computer have to do with the gene therapy programme ? I 'm a little behind the curve on the whole gene therapy thing . Well , basically , gene therapy is a process ... whereby you extract diseased cells from a patient ... and alter them at the genetic level . - Reprogramme them to execute a task . - A task ? Well , say to replace the remaining diseased cells . When you inject the reprogrammed cells back into the patient ... bye-bye diseased cells . Well , that 's the theory , anyway . It 's still largely experimental . This cellular reprogramming , it 's done by computers ? Well , you need computers to manipulate the gene sequence . The number of combinations is staggering . So if someone got into the system ... they could rewrite the information being given to the cells . Rewrite them to do what ? They compelled Gerald Wilkerson to kill Ed Scrivens , for one . You can 't programme people like that . People aren 't robots . - Aren 't they ? - No . You 've heard the tales . Twins separated at birth . They both use the same brand of toothpaste ... name their kids Lloyd , love Kenny G. We are robots . We 're just not made out of metal . We 're meatballs . So what are you saying ? Gerald Wilkerson was reprogrammed ? I didn 't say that . That kind of specific behaviour requires a knowledge of the human genome ... that mankind hasn 't even begun to approach . What if we 're not talking about mankind ? Son of a bitch . I knew you were gonna say that . These late night meetings Wilkerson was having with the other patients ... - that 's gotta have something to do with this . - You 're damn straight . That 's why I 'm going there tonight . I wanna see what 's in that warehouse . I don 't like where this is heading at all . Breaking and entering . Sounds like fun . - Count me in . - Me , too . I think I better go alone . That 's not how this works . We 're still a crew , and this is still a mission . Besides , you 're gonna need a lookout . Just testing . - Well , I 'm not going , and that 's the end of it . - The Andersons are expecting us . - They 'll understand . - But I don 't . I don 't understand . We 've been through this , Paige . I gotta handle something at work . That 's an explanation ? You have something to handle at work ? I already told you when Ed Scrivens died ... things started getting a little hectic around at the Centre . If things are so hectic , why are the Andersons still having a party ? Why isn 't Burt Anderson heading off with you ? - I cannot argue about this now , Paige . - Because I 'm right ! You are using work as an excuse to get out of this . Why ? I can 't even begin to imagine ! You don 't have to imagine because we 're gonna talk about it later ! No , God damn it ! Now ! This party is important . Important for Marc , for his future . You don 't know a goddamn thing about his future . - And you do . - That 's right , I do ! He does not give a shit about being an astronaut . He never did , he never will . You 've got to hear me ... because I 'm gonna tell you something ... and I need your help . Something happened to me on this last mission . The last mission ? The last shuttle mission ? Yeah , but not the mission you know . A mission that happened five years from now . What ? Sit down . Just sit down . Chuck . What ? Five years from now , I was in orbit with Neil . Neil ? Yeah , Neil . And the world exploded . And ... Listen to me , listen . And you and Marc are dead , and everybody you know is gone . And Neil and I and this crew ... we were saved by this alien . Just hear me . Paige , we were saved by some , I don 't know , being . And he sent us back here ... to try to stop this horrible thing from happening . This thing that 's already happened . You understand ? Neil and I are here from the future . This isn 't funny , Chuck . Listen to me , Paige . I am begging you , don 't leave me . Are you having an affair ? Get out of here . My bookie figured I had an inside tip on the games , so he put money down . Other people took his lead . They told other people ... and the whole thing must have mushroomed like a feedback loop . The only thing I can figure is that word must 've filtered out to the team ... word that they were expected to win , and somehow this got to the kicker . And the kick was close , anyway . And that extra information ... that extra tiny bit of pressure threw him off . He blew the kick . He blew the fucking kick . A simple thing like that , a rumour , changed history . Oh , God . Kind of gives you hope in a strange sort of way . Oh , tons . Is that why you decided to rejoin the cause ? Well , I figured , you know , what the hell ? I 'm broke . And there 's still one week till Indiana-Purdue . So what 's your excuse ? Scrivens ' death . I mean , if we don 't do what we can to keep the world in one piece ... it pretty much doesn 't matter whether my son lives or dies . You ever think about having kids ? Darling , my most significant contribution to this planet ... could very well be my decision not to breed . - Follow me . - Yeah . Okay , let 's go . Neil , here 's the phone . You and Sarah be the good eye over by that shack . If you see any traffic coming either way , you give us the buzz ... and get the hell out of here and don 't wait for us . That 's right . We 're expendable . Angela , put a light on this gate . Kurt , come with me . Son of a bitch ! Chuck , Chuck , this way . This way . Hey , guys . Step . - I think this is the place . - What place ? Where all the shit you ever lost winds up . Anyone find a Bobby Sherman eight-track , it belongs to me . Maybe not . Shit ! Oh , my God . Organic fluorine , oxitane polymer , polylethylene . These are ... These chemicals are used in manufacturing . Manufacturing what ? Perhaps whatever 's in there . Wow . Holy shit . Is it me or is this the right size for a person ? Looks like motor oil . More like snot . Or some kind of amniotic fluid . Oh , shit . Shit . Come on . - Come on . Come on . - What 's wrong ? - I can 't get through . It must be the links . - Oh , my God . Feels like something alive in there . What the hell ? I think you just woke it up . I think it 's waking up in a bad mood . Come on . Yeah ? Dad ? Dad ? Get the fuck out of there ! Get the fuck out . - Go ! - Come on . Go ! Go ! Chuck ! Come , come on ! Chuck ! Chuck ! Chuck ! God damn it ! - Chuck ! Come on . - Let 's go ! Chuck , they 're coming ! Get your ass out of there quick ! - Let 's go ! - Come on ! Go ! Chuck ! Get out of the way . Get out of the way ! I have a distinct feeling they 're on to us . Dad ! Go , go , go ! Go ! We 're gonna have to work on this part of the job . Go . Move it . We can forget about the warehouse . That thing is completely empty . Rented by some boating supply firm who 's moving in as we speak . Whatever they were doing , they 're just gonna start over somewhere else . Eventually . But now they know somebody 's on to them . Maybe they 'll lie low for a while . From what I understand , Barantz 's patients have all resumed normal lives . It 's as if nothing has happened . Well , what were they doing in there ? I mean , what was that thing ? That 's what we gotta find out . I wonder if it 's enough what we did , enough to stop it from coming . Place a bet on Houston , alter a whole football game . It 's possible we just turned it all around . Of course we may have just made things worse . Instead of five years from now , maybe it 'll blow next week . Yeah , well , there 's no way we can really know , can we ? Well , at least we know more than we did when we started . - What do we know ? - We know there 's someone out there . - Someone . - Someone what ? I was just thinking , right before The Seeker sent us back ... I asked him why he didn 't make the jump himself . Do you remember what he said ? " Only organics can jump . " Which means what ? That The Seeker is inorganic ? Artificial ? That 's my assumption . So what do we do now ? Well , first things first . Who had the bacon cheeseburger ? - Me . - Cough it up . Honey , have you seen this ? The mutation rate is by 37 % . I didn 't programme them to do this . They 're evolving on their own . And look at this . There are organisms here I 've never seen before . It 's like they 're constructing their own habitats . We really have something here . Yes , we do . - You make me crazy . - So do you .

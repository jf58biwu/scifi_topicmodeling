 I 'm feeling sick . We better turn around and go home . What 's wrong , honey ? I got the D.T. ' s . Milo , that 's a mommy illness . Come on . There 's nothing to be nervous about . Parent-teacher night is two hoots and a sock full of yowzas . How do you survive in the world ? I 'm not going in. I 've just experienced complete renal failure . What is it , son ? You got something to hide ? Sort of . Do you have to wear that hat , Dad ? You look like a Robin Hood PEZ dispenser . Biff and Chip are super , super , super individuals . It 's a privilege to have them on my ball club . And how are they doing scholastically ? Well , Biff has a lot of potential but no initiative . And Chip has a lot of initiative but no potential . Either way , they 're ahead of the game . The doctors were sure one of them would shrivel up and fall off . - Hi . Tab and Scooter . - Peggy 's parents . Well , isn 't that magical ? I voted yes on Prop 42 . Good . We certainly need a new sewer system . All the other parents are so cool . I lucked out . My parents can 't come . - They got typhus . - lt 's getting late . Maybe my parents won 't make it to our class . Get away from me . Hear about the man who fell into the lens grinder ? He made a spectacle of himself . Stop. I 'll wet my pants . Helga , I want you to take this compass and drive it deep into my forehead . My big boy in the fourth grade . Seems like only yesterday , I was wiping your poopy little fanny . And his diaper rash . He 'd be raw from knees to nipples . That is some nasty grub . I thought you kids at least got some decent meals at school . Due to limited funding , our stove was purchased secondhand from the Haitian navy . Why don 't some of these rich parents buy a new stove ? Actually , the hill children have catered meals brought in . Well , la-di-da . Oh , your little desk , Milo . Mom , you 're too big to- - - Hey , look , an organ ! - Dad , no ! Come on , sing with me ! Now just the gals ! At least the worst day of the year is almost over . Not quite . Monday 's the first day of the new semester and you know what that means . We all get judged by our new wardrobes . Could it get any worse ? Get it off ! Get if off ! Get it off ! Get if off ! Sorry , Milo . Money 's a little tight . So you 'll have to wear Biff and Chip 's hand-me-downs . Mom , the armpits smell and there 's four of them . Hey , that 's our only shirt . You can 't even take a nap around here . - Can I at least get some new shoes ? - l 'll be happy to cobble you up a new pair . Why don 't you go to the woodpile and pick out a nice log ? I don 't want log shoes . I want store-bought . Now , Milo , I 've never had a new pair of shoes in my life . Maybe I could wear this hat . There it is . My golf pantlet . I 'm tired of hauling my own weight . Let 's take the escalator . On second thought , there 's a lot of good shops on the first floor . Look , they 've got Tommy Vinegar ! May I help you ? Could you suggest anything that will divert attention from my buttocks ? - A world war ? - You 're funny . You 're also old . Soon you will be dead . Then we dig up your grave and make your corpse do embarrassing things à la Weekend at Bernie 's . This is exactly what I want . How much are these ? Four hundred dollars . Look at this . This would look so cute on you . No , on you . Let 's all buy the same things and borrow each other 's clothes . Will that be cash or charge ? Right , right . Charge , of course . Those boys are spitting . It 's so disgusting . Good loogie , Jared . Excellent texture . - l got gum on my new shoes . - You can have your maid scrape it off . No , then I 'd have to go in that creepy room she lives in . Forget these . Wow . Michael Jumps-a-Lots ! I 'm keeping them . An unconscious kid . I 'm keeping him . - Morning , honey . - You got a little milk mustache there . These are spectacular shoes . It 's probably best not to wear those today , son. lt 's raining cats and dogs . Oh , no ! Actually , it 's raining rain . I 'm just busting your chops . Mom , where do we keep my wet-weather gear ? Honey , I don 't even know where we keep the bread . Oh , well , nothing can hurt Michael Jumps-a-Lots . They 're handmade by highly-skilled Chinese babies . These will keep you dry , sweetie . Trash-bag poncho and sandwich-bag galoshes . There you go . Please , God , bring the lightning . - You 've got a bucket on your head . - Really ? I wasn 't aware . What a loser . Yeah , with a capital " loo . " Let 's shove him in something . Hey , cool lid . - What did he say ? - Funzie likes Milo 's bucket . And he 's way cool . I 'll be in my office . Why do we think he 's cool again ? I can 't believe anyone thought that stupid bucket you wore yesterday was cool . Yeah . No one even noticed I finally shaved my pits . Why is everyone wearing buckets ? Because we 're bucketheads . It 's the latest thing . I know. I invented it . Stop lying . And if you wear one now , you 'll just be copying us . - But I was the first- - - Copying . - But I wore- - - Copying . - lt was- - - Copy . The Debbies stole the bucket thing . I was cool for 20 seconds . I can 't go back. I won 't . Milo , being cool isn 't all that it 's cracked up to be . Take my word for it . I hung with a hip crowd in high school . Right , when you were dating Mr. Fancy-Pants , Tommy Vinegar . You dated Tommy Vinegar ? Yeah , he was one of my boy toys . Mommy used to have no shame . Why didn 't you marry him ? Then we 'd be rich . - We wouldn 't have to live in this hellhole . - l 'll tell you why she didn 't marry him . She met the funkmaster general . That 's right . Your old man had some bell-bottoms as wide as all get-out and a fro you wouldn 't believe . Thanks for the ride , dudes . Dang , I was fly . Then how did you get so lame ? It happens . Mom , if you hung with Tommy Vinegar , then you must be cool . School me . There 's nothing to school . It 's all attitude . It 's not what you wear . It 's how you wear it . There . Now it 's not just a bucket , it 's a ham bucket . is that cool ? You tell me , hotshot . I am one styling mofo . What 's that goober wearing on his bucket ? It 's a ham . How lame . Yeah , but if it 's so lame , how come he 's acting so cool ? Don 't you know ? Ham buckets are the newest thing . I 'm getting one today . Who 's your designer , Milo ? Some beyotch . Swing by my crib après school , and I 'll hook you up . Bitchen move . My spine ! Either I am really smashed , or you and your friends look exactly alike . We want ham buckets . Who the hell are you , and what in God 's name is a ham bucket ? Mom , you created them . I 'll pay you whatever you want . Biff , Chip , run to the store and get me 50 buckets and 50 yams . Hams , Mom . Who would wear a yam ? - Fifty dollars . - Fifty bones ? I ain 't got that kind of scratch . I work for a living , lady . For Milo 's little friends , they 're on the house . But they 'll cheapen the coolness factor . Do you want another spanking like last night ? - Mom , that wasn 't me . That was Dad . - That 's none of your business . - Enjoy . - Thank you , Mrs. Oblong . May the road always rise up to meet you . May- - You go play now . Mine 's too small . Try this . Perfect. I 've never felt prettier than with this garbage can on my head . The irony is even within my grasp . This is a special treat , kids thanks to your mother selling all those buckets . Okay , everyone ready ? My Lord , lt 's a Maori warrior . Honey , do we have our Land camera in the car ? Dad , he 's our waiter . We like beef dinner . You know , moo ! Beef . Good . I 'm getting the manager . Man , I wish we could eat decent food like this every day . I wish you could too , but that would involve me and the kitchen and I 'm just not seeing it . But I haven 't grown in two years . Well , unless you count this . Hey , wait. lf l can come up with a few more fashion ideas I could earn enough to buy the school a stove . All right ! Promise you won 't forget about this when the martinis wear off . Kids , they never wear off . Hey , Milo , what 's that on your back ? My mom 's latest design . It 's a ham backpack , or ham-pack . Wow , that is so rad . - Oh , my God. I love it . - lt 's totally cute . It 's all for the ladies . I hate that Ob-dong 's become so cool . But I have no mind of my own , so I simply have to accept it . Hey , Milo , you wanna go loiter at the A to Zed with the in-crowd ? Are you kidding ? This is everything I 've ever wanted . That was kind of a gayer response than I 'd hoped for . Actually , he has an emergency clubhouse meeting . Yeah , we 've located a slug the size of a cucumber . And we have to vote on what to smash it with . I got a better idea . Why don 't you come with us ? No way , dude . They 're losers . Well , you heard the man . Here , Milo , take this scooter . No one 's using it . But , Milo , I thought we were your posse . I 'm sorry , really. I 'm a wreck about this . Let 's kick it . Wanna go smash a slug ? Milo , now that you 're one of the young mods I was wondering if you might do me a favor . I 've got 30 stone of digestive biscuits moldering in the back . If you were to be spied nibbling one , they might sell a little more briskly . Oh , yeah , I 'm up in it . Endorsement denied . I declare this place uncool . As well as all of England and parts of Wales . Oh , bollocks . But , Milo , you haven 't even tried the mutton nachos . Oh , fiddly-pip , When will you assimilate ? Could someone move all this crap so I can park my wheels ? It 's not crap . It 's my new body spray . A light floral scent in a ham base . I call it Jambon . Would you give your father a hand ? He 's having some trouble stirring . No can do . I 'm going to a rave in a skanky warehouse thrown by some scary guy nobody knows . Well , as long as you 're going , why don 't you spritz on some Jambon ? It 'll get people interested . I need a scent that will take me from daytime to nighttime . And this stops just short of dusk . Plus it smells like ham . - Endorsement denied . - What ? Milo , do I have to remind you the money 's going to buy a stove for your cafeteria ? I don 't eat there anymore. I 'm too cool . Milo , you wouldn 't be cool if it weren 't for my designs . Mamacita , I think you 've got it backwards . Your designs wouldn 't be cool if I hadn 't worn them . You 're just like Tommy Vinegar . I made him cool too . And then it went to his head . Uppity bitch-boy . I don 't need anyone 's help to be cool , and I 'll prove it . I 'm gonna launch my own line of threads . That 's what I call clothes . Milo . Pickles , dear . I believe I 'm being rendered . Then we 're all agreed . Milo is hereby banished from the clubhouse and loses all member privileges , which include climbing the tree sitting on the box and staring out the window . Et tu , Peggy ? Well , well . A dog always returns to its vomit . - Wait a minute . - Never mind . Big news . I 've decided to launch my own fashion line and I need your help . Why should we help you when you 've been a fantastic ass ? I 'll make you cool . After all , I did it for me . He 's got a point . A bigger dork there never was . Okay , here 's the dealio . I 'm gonna have my fashion show this Saturday . But that 's when your mother is launching Jambon . I know. I 'm gonna blast her out of the water . - lt 's the clash of the titans . - Okay , here 's what we 're gonna to do . I have a very large pot suitable for hot tar or boiling oil or a seafood gumbo . What do we need that for ? It 's just that it was rather pricey , and I haven 't used it nearly as much as I thought I would , and ... . Never mind . I am worried about Milo . Being popular has really gone to his head . Oh , he 's probably just afraid of becoming a fuddy-duddy like his old man . Sweetheart , you 're the one who showed me there are more important things in life than being cool . There are , aren 't there ? Like getting down off a stool without shattering your coccyx . That 's my Bob . Blaine , Jared , Debbie , Debbie , Debbie ! How come he got two fruity kisses and I only got one ? It is part of the enigma that is Milo . Okay , everybody , it 's showtime . You cruel bastard . Helga , stop eating your fringe . You shouldn 't have made it out of bacon . Okay , let 's go , let 's go ! My first design is a cocktail dress made entirely of eucalyptus leaves . Koala bear ! Koala bear ! Sorry about that , mate . And now Mikey is a silvery vision of silver . These versatile tinfoil pants are perfect for spring , summer or lining the drip pan in your oven . And now in a stylish and apparently delicious dress I give you Helga . - What ? - Please , God someone poke my eyes out ! This is stupid . Your stuff sucks , Milo . To think I let you kiss the air next to my cheek . Kiss this , Milo . Wait . We haven 't even gotten to the cruisewear . That 's for saying " cruisewear . " Hey , cool beak . Hey , Funzie likes her beak . Quick , to the beak store . Where are all our customers ? Surely everyone saw the one-line advertisement l placed in the " et cetera " section of our local PennySaver . Maybe they don 't wanna smell like flowers and pork . That 's their problem. I think it 's two great smells that smell great together . It 's over . Everyone hated my designs . Oh , I 'm sorry , honey . I tried to warn you . The problem with being cool is it doesn 't last . Yeah , it blows with the wind . Much like the dreaded hantavirus . Hello , Pickles . Tommy Vinegar ? Tommy ? What are you doing here ? I was paper-training my bichon frise when I happened upon your advert . I wrote that advert . Pickles , how wonderful . You married a Weeble . So , let me get a whiff of this body spray . That is an eye-watering stink . I don 't give a rat 's heinie what you think. I like it . Your blasé attitude suggests you know something I don 't . Therefore , I shall buy your product outright and market it as my own . I 'll just carry these vats out to my Chevrolet minivan . Hey , there 's enough here to buy the school a stove with just enough left over to get me bombed . Now I see what you mean about attitude , Mom . But how do you not care about what people think ? Well , I am married to a great guy and I have great kids . And you all think I 'm cool , so I must be . So you 're saying I should marry Dad ? You just ruined what could have been a very poignant family moment . Should we hug anyway ? - l don 't care . - Attaboy ! Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

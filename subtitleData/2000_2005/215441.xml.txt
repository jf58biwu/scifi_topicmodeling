 Ah , taking a bath is great ! It 's such a great feeling ! Oh , it 's Uncle Utsugi ! Hello ? Hi , Uncle ! Hi , Honey . The other day I finally found that thing I told you about . Dr. Kisaragi gave it to me ... . Who are you ? Uncle ? What are you doing ? Uncle ? What 's going on ? I can 't stay here ! HONEY FLASH ! Oh no ! Not enough energy ! What am I going to do ? I don 't have any clothes ! This 'll have to do ! Garbage bag ? Thank you very much ! Alright , stomach 's full now ! I think it 'll work now ! HONEY FLASH ! Dispatch confirmed ... Aqualine route confirmed All units mobilized ... . Perfect . Like a cornered rat . Chief ! Chief ! Status report ! Currently Dr. Utsugi is still unharmed . The kidnapper 's demands ? Nothing yet . What are those idiots thinking ? I 'll talk to them directly . You crooks there ! Release the Professor and give yourself up immediately ! Do you think you can escape ? How boring ... Not even worth my time . What 's that ? I can 't hear you . You 're naive ! I said you 're naive ! You think you can defeat Panther Claw with this ? Panther Claw ? Indeed ! As a one of the four members of Panther Claw , I , Gold Claw , will play with you ! Boss ! A battle is determined by numbers and strength ! Fire ! She 's gone ! That was dangerous ! Are you alright ? I 'm glad ! Go ! Hey you ! Don 't butt in ! I can handle a situation like this myself ! I 'm sorry ! Damn ! These guys are persistent ! Ms. Gold Claw , What ? The Professor got away ! What 's that ? A traitor ? He hit me ! Idiot ! After them ! There he is ! We found him ! Ms. Gold Claw , we 've captured the professor . You made us waste time ! Exsqueeze me . Hey you , armour and helmet lady and minions , We have the professor here . Give yourselves up immediately ! Don 't be ridiculous ! Keep your nonsense to yourself ! The professor is right here ... That is Professor Utsugi ! But then ... You ! You 're not Professor Utsugi ! You 're slow to catch on , Panther Claw . HONEY FLASH ! Who are you ? ! Shall I clue you in , Panther Claw ? At times a bike racer . At other times a female officer , a Panther Claw minion , or a stand in for Professor Utsugi . However , my true identity is ... Warrior of love , Cutie Honey ! Panther Claw or whoever you are , prepare yourself ! With you , this might be amusing ! Not bad little girl . My turn now ! Any time ! GOLD ATTACK ! That wasn 't nice . Alright ! Why you ! Little girl ! I 'm done playing now ! GOLD MISSILE ! Why you ! Hey ! ? The Professor ... . I 'd like to play more , but I have to deliver this guy . Farewell ! Little girl ! You 're not getting away ! HONEY BOOMERANG ! No way ! You 're kidding ! Uncle ! He 's okay , he 's only unconscious . That 's good ! Squad chief of the Public Safety division , Detective Aki Natsuko . I 'm taking you in . 11 o 'clock and 22 minutes , brought into custody . Hmm , false arrest ... . Who 're you ? Hayami Seiji . What are you ? Newspaper reporter . Why 's a civilian here . And the media no less . Dunno ... This guy 's identity is suspicious , bring him in too . Yes . Unnecessary roughness ... There 's no need for this . Now , you two , come with me . Hey you , you planning on escaping ? Yup ! I 'm late ! See yah ! HONEY FLASH ! Damn , my only lead ... . Happiness won 't come walking to me , And so I have to walk to it ! Good Morning ! Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . It 's not good morning anymore . It 's good afternoon now . Yes . Good morning . Can someone do something about her ? Would someone fire her ? These youngsters nowadays ... . So irresponsible . Ms. Kisargi , Yes ? Excuse me ! I 'll help right away ! Will you stop that and get to work ? Yes ! C 'mon , pass out the tea . Yes , right away ! Let 's see ... who needs it most first ... . Here , your tea . Here . I 'm done ! Man , you 're useless ! Listen , first it 's the boss . Next his assistant . Then the head supervisor . And his assistant . And then your supervisor . And then the rest by seniority . You know , when are you going to learn how things are done here ? But I thought if I did it like this , everyone would enjoy it . Are you stupid ? How old do you think you are ? It 'll be almost a year since I was reborn . What ? I can 't figure you out . Head Supervisor , I think she should be fired . You expect us to believe that ? But this is a fact . Please read my report . The truth is this , The Tokyo Aqualine was heavily damaged . Repairs will be significant . The criminals involved were not arrested . We don 't have a single lead . It 's turned into a massive disgrace ! We 're under constant pressure . The serial abductions of beautiful women are unsolved and the media is having a field day . My head hurts just thinking about it . Perfect . Chief , coffee ? I don 't need it . Um , what can we ... Just wait for further orders . Ms. Kisaragi , I 'm counting on you . Here 's 5 onigiri . Thanks ! Damn , when did I start taking work in exchange for onigiri ? Thanks , here 's 3 onigiri as a present . Ms. Kisaragi , I need this by 7 / 14 , please . Here 's 3 onigiri and ... . But ... I like onigiri . I guess it 's okay ! Good job ! Where do you want to go for dinner ? Want to catch a movie ? Gee , everyone 's got it so nice . I want to go out and play too . But you know ... I gotta finish today 's work . Overtime again ? Yeah . I can 't turn them down when they give me onigiri . Another late night , huh ? Yeah . Here , for you . Wow ! Thanks as usual ! Mm , yummy ! Auntie , your homemade ones are always great ! Hey , I 'll help you , Auntie . Help me ? Thanks ! Morning , Kitty ! You came today too ! Hey hey , you listening ? Oh yeah , I should call Uncle . Hello , Professor Utsugi is currently unavailable . He is currently with Panther Claw . If you have business with him , you should just give it up and hang up . What ? ! What 's that ? ! Taken from right under our noses . That 's why I can 't leave things to others . Ms. Aki Natsuko ... . Hmm , need some clues ! Let 's do it ! Kisaragi ! Where 's Kisaragi ? She 's not here . Seems she 's going to be late . Again ? ! What 's up with her ? ! Squad chief of the Public Safety Division , Detective Aki Natsuko . Don 't expect me to give you a leak . I don 't want the people above to come down on me like you . Oh , Chief ! Could I get your signature on this ? Oh , just who I wanted to see . Get me the public notice . Huh ? Just now ... . What ? Proof ? What 're you asking me for ? Don 't know a thing . Give it up ! And I figured the police would at least have some clues . You seem to be having a bit of trouble , young miss . Hey , you 're that guy ! I thank you for that . Let me introduce myself , news journalist , Hayami Seiji . Pleased to meet you . S-same here . Hmm , by far cuter than I 've heard . The name Cutie Honey is most appropriate ! Oh my my my ! There 's no need to use the I System . How do you know about that ? It 's my business . Discovering the truth is my job . What are you here for ? To tell you about clues . Why for me ? Because I 'm on your side ! On my side ? Those soldiers you defeated mysteriously vanished . And their abilities we saw exceeded human capabilities . That was due to the nano-machines that were fused into their bodies . You should know about those . Well , I 'm pretty sure I heard about some system like that somewhere . Is it ... . That 's right ! Your father Professor Kisaragi , the development of his research . It 's the same as the AI system . So could it be that 's what Panther Claw is after ... . Exactly . The technology that Professor Kisaragi was developing , and then the kidnapping of Professor Utsugi who continued his research ... . That 's why father was killed ? And now Uncle Utsugi ? And so ... . want to know more ? Yes , I want to know ! Well then , from here on it 'll be a business deal . Then what were we doing up to now ? A token of my thanks . So what 's the business deal ? An exclusive interview . That 's my condition . Of course , I 'd like to ask you something too . Oh my . How did you know that I can never refuse the request of a woman , Nat-chan ? Nat-chan ? ! Oh , it 's Nat-chan ! Nat-chan ! Nat-chan ! The criminals , the secret organization Panther Claw . These people , they use any means in order to satisfy their desires . They 're radical egotists . And have a vast array of weapons integrated into their bodies . They have a group of unbelievable soldiers . So that 's the secret organization Panther Claw ? Who 's the leader ? She 's called Sister Jill . Sister Jill ... . It has been a long time , Mistress Sister Jill . Returning from Panther Zora 's side , It is indeed an honour . What ? You 're going by yourself ? Of course ! This is a job for the police . Okay then , let me give you a ride to headquarters . I 'll walk . The basis of investigation is leg work . Nat-chan , I 'll work with you ! No need . I said I 'll work with you ! Pesky . Meanie . Well then , we 're off . The only thing you can count on is the system . Alright , follow the plan . It has been a long time , Mistress Sister Jill . I am pleased to be witness to your beauty . To see your 2,222nd reawakening . We humbly present to you ... our undying service . Black Claw . Cobalt Claw . Gold Claw . Scarlet Claw . First are faithful servants to Mistress Jill , 10,000 soldiers . Next for Mistress Jill 's meal , I present to you a years worth of fresh human women . Furthermore , the beautiful and powerful as Mistress Jill desires , weapons made of solid gold ! And finally , As Mistress Jill demands , beautiful and grand , I present , newly constructed , the Jill Tower . If there is anything further you desire , you need only to command it . We will fulfil it immediately . We take our leave . Boring . Nothing has changed in this tiring world . Mistress Jill , There is one additional thing I would like to inform you about . So it 's Panther Claw . Not only father , but they involved Uncle Utsugi too ? Do you find it unforgivable ? Of course ! Vengeance is a futile endeavour . You should give it up . What do you mean ? Hate doesn 't suit you . If you fight for that reason , I don 't think your father would be happy . Then why should I ? You 'll have to discover that for yourself . Cheapskate . In any case , you 're their focus and I 'm sure they 'll attack again . Be careful . Don 't underestimate them . Looks like someone 's following us . Quite obviously too . Yes , no problem . They have no idea . They 've put on their hazards . Looks like they 're stopping . The door 's opening , a woman is getting out . What should we do ? She 's waving ! Follow the woman . Roger that ! Follow her ! Oh no ! See ya ! Oh no ! It 's this late already ! That light ... She couldn 't be ... . So , an unknown woman called Cutie Honey ? She seems matched in ability to those four and has been fighting them . She seems to possess a similar system . Interesting . Find her . As you wish . According to reports , Professor Kisaragi 's daughter died in an accident a year ago . Yes , I know that . But we know that daughter holds the key to the I System . Contact me when you 've got something . Yes , it 'll be sometime soon . So , what next ? Good Morning ! It 's not good morning ! It 's even past good afternoon ! Listen , why are you here ? Excuse me , but this is a company , right ? Squad chief of the Public Safety Division , Detective Aki Natsuko . There 's no question about it . It 's the woman detective that was at the scene with that girl . There 's probably some connection . What an unrefined report . That 's fine . If it 's wrong , we 'll just get rid of her . Hey , weren 't you eating an onigiri yesterday morning ? You were , right ? Ms. Kisaragi 's staring again . Seriously scary ! It 's because she doesn 't have any friends to talk to . There 's someone here to see you ! This is the first time , isn 't it ? Yup ! Nat-chan ! Bye ! Why are you running away ? Could it be because you 're feeling guilty ? No , not at all ! I 'd like to ask you some questions . But I 'm in the middle of work right now . Here 's no good . Over here . I 'm glad , dear . You 've finally made a friend ! Here ! Sorry , but I only drink Blue Mountain , black . Wow , what a snob . Then I 'll have it . About the other time ... . No ! I 'll never break up ! Pathetic . I hate women that cry ! I got it already . That 's what men want . Men want only young women , right ? How stupid ! Now look , my mascara 's running . What are you doing here ? Get back to work ! I don 't wanna see your face , idiot ! I 'm sorry ! Here 's no good either . Come with me . Oh , okay ... . Damn , what should I do about the next guy ? So , here 's the problem . I 've checked the Public Safety databases on you . There isn 't a single thing about you . Just who are you ? What 's your relation with Cutie Honey ? Who 's that journalist ? Where 's this Panther Claw ? You 're going to tell me everything right now . Use any means to achieve your goal . That 's a great phrase . Damn ... Who the hell could this be ? It 's me , Hayami Seiji . You ! How 'd you get my cell number ? ! Investigating is my job . Anyway , you shouldn 't go off on your own ! The enemy 's already watching you . What are you talking about ? They 're there already , Panther Claw ! The door is closing . Hey you , butt out ! I can take care of this situation myself . I 'm sorry . But what the heck was that ? Someone you know ? Well , someone I know , but I don 't know ... . I don 't know ... . Fishy ... Definitely fishy ! You 're going to tell me everything at HQ ! What the heck ? ! Nat-chan ! You can 't get away now ! Now hurry and tell me about Honey . Otherwise ... Now , tell me . That 's what I want to know ! Oh my , wrong answer ! HONEY FLASH ! Impressive ! You ! Are you Panther Claw ? Bullseye ! One of the four of Panther Claw . That mysterious device , along with your neck ... I , Cobalt Claw , will be taking it ! I swear vengeance for my father ! Panther Claw , I 'll never give it to you ! Cutie Honey ... is that girl ? I will have what I want ! Our desire and pleasure This is our style . What style ? You should consider others ! Gotcha ! Tres bien ! What a wonderful scream ! That 's the reason why I cannot give up killing people . You ! Is this how you killed my father a year ago ? What 's that ? Hmm , do you remember what you ate a year ago ? Panther Claw ! I 'll never forgive you ! This doesn 't bother me at all , you know . Oh my , but heat does not agree with me . It 's hot ! So , how does that feel ! No ! It hurts ! It hurts ! You okay ? That 's good ! This is NOT good ! What the hell is going on ? ! What about Honey ? I 'm not sure what 's going on , but it 's getting hot ! That 's not good ! We have to transform her back ! I 'm counting on you , Nat-chan ! Hold on ! Counting on me ? ! Hey you ! You have to shut off your transformation circuit ! No ! If I stop now I won 't get revenge for my father ! Stop it ! Criminals have to be arrested ! Stop it now ! Shut up ! I 'll never forgive them ! Ms. Honey 's anger and hatred has appeared to have burnt Cobalt Claw to crisp . I have no interest in the weak . However ... Ms. Honey 's radiance ... does it interest you ? It appears Prof Kisaragi failed to make the nano-machines dis - and reassemble matter on a quark level . It would be ideal for granting me eternal life . To think there is a human capable of this . I cannot scorn this world . This is the first time you have smiled . I have no need for such inferior things . Because she 's based on human cells , it limits her activity . So this his her weak point after all . You awake ? Thanks ! You saved me ! Under the circumstances ... Wow ! If I could help it , I didn 't really want to bring you here . Anyways , about that thing of yours ... . If I can help it , I don 't really want to talk about it . It was a present . From my father . My body was destroyed in an accident a year ago . But I was reborn . Thanks to my father 's invention , the I System . I System ? Right , the Imaginary Induction System . This choker 's part of it . So , you 're a robot ? You 're an android ? I don 't believe it . You see , I 'm just the same as a human . This body is a copy of my previous body . But I don 't have any memories from then . The only memory I have of my father is of holding his hand . But I can just make new memories , right ? First outsider to know of Honey 's true identity ... . Well , I suppose that 's fine . Sorry Nat-chan , for getting you mixed up in this . Never mind that , it 's just part of my job . I finally realized today ... The feeling of hating someone is really frightening . The feeling of loving someone is just as frightening . If it 's the same , then I think I 'd rather love someone . I see ... Is this what Seiji was talking about ? Go to sleep already . Good night . My body seems to be fading . I must have the I System soon . Mistress . What 's this ? ! I 'm glad ! They 're blooming ! They 're really beautiful , Nat-chan ! You should just butt out ! Say ... Say ... Why ? But they 're blooming now . You used the power of the I System , right ? Yeah . The I System can revive living things . But it cannot create new life . That 's why I like living things . It doesn 't have any meaning . Unless you take care of them yourself and make them bloom . I 'm sorry . You 're feeling better now , right ? Then would you leave . If I stay here , I 'll get these people involved . I can 't stay here ! Um , excuse me ... have we met somewhere before ? No , we 've never met ! We 're putting pressure on the Japanese government and the Department of Foreign Affairs . Everything 's going according to your scenario . Thanks . We 're going to need a report soon . Why don 't you quit beating around the bush . No need to worry . I 'll be on time . It 's coming together . When it comes down to it , you can 't count on the system . Ms. Aki Natsuko ... . There 's no need for you to continue this useless investigation . You 'll be assigned to the serial kidnapping case . Why is that ? The American Government is taking over . They 're going to conduct the investigation on the Professor . So I 'm going to take the blame ? You 're the one in charge , Of course you are . There isn 't anything else you can do . Seems we expected too much from the youth of nowadays . This is your punishment . Hold it . We 'll take your firearm . I don 't have any clues to go on . There 's nothing I can come up with by myself . At times like this , I just have to believe and rely on others ! Welcome ! So ? What did you want to talk about ? Now now , let 's not be so formal . Now then , here . Sake ? Yes . I 've done some investigation on you , Nat-chan . Your favourite flower is the cosmos . Your favourite word is " perfect " . And your favourite drink is Japanese sake . Specifically this locally brewed sake from Yamaguchi . You 've missed one thing , The kind of men I hate are journalists . And unfortunately I only drink alone . Just like your work . How sad . I wish you 'd understand the feelings of a man who went through all this trouble . GOOD MORNING ! What 're you doing here ? I called Seiji and he said to come right over . Did I do something wrong ? Just your timing . I 'm not quite sure what 's going on , but sorry Nat-chan ! Whatever . I 've decided not to have anything to do with you . But fate has brought us together again . Fate ? I don 't think so , It 's that journalist 's scheme . What ? But since were reunited now ... . Pesky ! Okay then , just by myself then . Nat-chan should enjoy life more . As long as you 're alive you know ? Will you shaddap ! When did she start drinking ? And she 's drinking like a fish ! Is she okay with alcohol ? I dunno , guess we 'll find out . Doesn 't look good ! For crying out loud ! I 've told you I hate women that cry ! Then why don 't you smile more , Nat-chan ! There ! Cut it out ! There there there ! There there there there ! There ! Oh yeah ! For future reference , I should see what a man 's room is like ! Hey Honey ! Not in there ! Honey ! Here we go ! Seiji , you 're really collecting data ! Something 's up with those two ... . Like a fish ... . Like a fish ... . I can 't stand it ! I can 't take it anymore ! I 'm gonna sing . So , you got karaoke ? Karaoke ? Yeah , this is a suite , isn 't it ? You should set it up ! Sorry bout that ... . So , you ! Do that Honey Flash thing and make some karaoke . KA-RA-O-KE ! That 's enough already ! That 's enough ! I 'm tired ! It seems Ms. Honey has a heart just like humans . And it seems she has a considerable attachment to Professor Utsugi . Thus , it should be simple to come up with a plan to bring her here . This is serious ... . The first time I 've been to a man 's place , I stay overnight and wake up with a hangover . Man , this is the pits ! Man , how degrading . Don 't just add to someone 's monologue ! Well , it 's just that I 'm picking up on your habits . Shut up ! Butt out ! See ! What 's up , Honey ? Where 's Nat-chan ? Do you think Nat-chan hates me ? No . She 's just confused . This is the first time she 's met someone like you , she doesn 't know how to act . You 're so straightforward she doesn 't know how to handle you . Then what about me ? Honey should be Honey . That 's all ! Here ! Ms. Kisaragi Honey . Today , we extend an invitation to three to visit us at Jill Tower . Wait ! Where 's that ? The details are in your invitations . Furthermore , we request formal attire . Now then , If you 'll excuse me . Invitations for three . That means ... The one more is ... Well , I hope this will be useful . When you 've been on the scene long enough , you can get a release for a lot . Remember that . Sir ! But what if the supervisors find out ? The supervisors only see a desk . Just fill out the paperwork and they 'll never know . Remember that ! Sir ! And here 's that man 's true identity . This guy was quite a pain to look up ! About the only thing I 'm good at is hacking . I see now . It makes sense now . Thanks you two . Thanks ... . That 's the first time I 've heard that . Let 's remember this moment ! I 've got a little something to take care of . Let 's split up here . Okay . Good luck , Seiji ! 'K then ! Later then ! Alright then ! I 've got to dress up too ! Hey ! Nat-chan ! You look so cute ! So you came . Hey , what 's with your hair ? And you 've left the tag on ! It 's no good ? I couldn 't do my hair myself . Finger perm , finger perm ... . Couldn 't you just use your Honey Flash ? Yeah , but you see , I 've decided to stop cheating . I should do things for myself , right ? You 're hopeless . Come over here . Nat-chan , you 're great ! Of course . I 've worked hard at doing everything myself . Your something else ! There , done . Thanks ! Hey ! You 're glasses are still broken , Nat-chan ! That 's alright . No it 's not ! Never mind ! It 's not good ! Hey , these don 't have any prescription ! They 're just for show ! Be quiet ! I 'll fix them , okay ? I thought you were going to stop cheating . For myself . But for everyone else I 'll do anything ! You 're cute when you wear glasses , But you 're cute without them too ! Who asked you . Here ! In any case , I 'll rescue the Professor by myself . But we should together ... . Sorry , but I 'll find my own way in . But ... . Nat-chan ! Good luck Nat-chan ! Later ! Now then ! Let 's go ! Mistress Sister Jill , This time I will bring that little girls head . Gold Claw , Mistress ! There is no need for you to go . Please forgive me , Mistress Sister Jill ! It is true that it was my fault that that little girl defeated me ! But this time I will not fail ! How unsightly . To plead for one 's life denies perfection . It 's just as well . Now then , The most appropriate stage for Honey 's invitation , it is set . It 's time . The Tokyo Tower ! Who 's there ? We 've been waiting . Ms. Honey . Panther Claw ! Where 's Uncle Utsugi ! What you are looking for , is right over there . Uncle ! Uncle ! Not to worry . We 've only inquired about the I System directly from his brain . You didn 't ! His memories ... We 've stolen them . He would be happier without those memories . Uncle ! Hang in there ! It 's me ! It 's Kisaragi Honey ! Uncle ... That watch was father 's . Uncle ! Oh my . Even though his memories are gone , it appears love remains . Of course ! Even if you steal our lives or our precious memories , Love ... you 'll never be able to steal our love ! We will be holding him . At the end of this path . However , you will find before you ... These obstacles . Then I 'll defeat you ! All of you ! Do you think you can ? Can you ? I 'll show you ! HONEY FLASH ! Wonderful ! This radiance ! I will surely bring it to Mistress Jill ! I 'm coming , Panther Claw ! I 've got to hurry and find the Professor . You there , girl . I won 't allow you any further . I , Scarlet Claw ... Will be taking your head ! Now that 's startling ! What a wonderful view ! A wonderful view ! Quite impressive , my Scarlet Beam ! Quite powerful , don 't you think ? Girl ... You can try dodging again , If you run again , that 'll mean their view will get even better ! Now then ... It 's about time for me to take that head of yours . Ow ow ow owie ! Look what 's happened to me ! Why you ! I 'll remember this ! I 'll get you ... over there ! Yeah ! So this is the true form of Jill . In the quest for the perfect cells , they have become very similar to plant cells . That completes my job . I don 't think my client will like this , But I 'm going to go ahead and use this here . Oh ! I 've been looking for you , Black Claw ! If you had the strength to come all this way , why didn 't you continue fighting ? It 's your turn now ! Hurry up and kill that girl ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! How unrefined . You have been released from your uglyness . To fight , that is an eternal pleasure . My sword , stand before it , steadfastly And answer this gaze . When it comes time , My desire will be satisfied . I am ... The strongest warrior ... Black Claw , hits the stage ! I 'll omit the second verse . Honey calls ! Nat-chan , you okay ? I 'm done with my little detour . I 'll reach the tower soon . I 'm going ahead . We have to rescue the Professor as soon as possible . What 's that ? They 're women that were being held here . So they were responsible for the serial kidnappings too ? Yeah . They were being used by Jill 's and were being held by her main body . I 've set them free . I used anti-nano-machines to lower Jill 's activity levels and free them . Superb ! Simply superb , Honey ! Such fighting strength . Such pleasure ! This may be a first ! Now , kindle my desire even more ! I 'm sorry ! ( Look , it 's Go Nagai ! ) BLACK TORNADO ! You won 't escape ! Panther Claw ! First , release Professor Utsugi ! That 'll be fine . However ... There is one condition . DON 'T ! Nat-chan ! NATSUKO ! Now then , Let us continue this enjoyment ! To personally deliver the final blow , That is the supreme pleasure ! Running out of energy ... . Honey , you did well . I compliment you . Please , father ... Protect me ! No ! I ... I 'm getting dizzy ! In this world , the power of desire , the light , and darkness to attain it all , I have been fused , and I swear , I shall never fail ! Farewell . HONEY BOOMERANG ! I have to go ... . I have to go ... . I 'm here ! Now return my Uncle ! As promised , he has already been released . Uncle ! And now , she will take his place . Nat-chan ! Never mind me and just get out of here ! You were able to withstand that , But I wonder about her . To present the I System is my sole objective . Just get out of here ! Get out of here ! No , I 'm not going to run . I have to save you , Nat-chan . Just butt out already ... . Could this also be love ? That is enough . Mistress ! I 'm glad you made it , Cutie Honey . You 're Sister Jill ? Correct . Eternal life , I have been given . I am ... Sister Jill . Honey , That I System you possess is wonderful . But how is your determination ? You have the same power of eternal life as I do . Why do you stay with these humans . I have no need for that ! What a regrettable existence . But if you do not wish to progress , then that is fine . I will take over that power . That power , for I who has surpassed humans , is most appropriate . Now , cross over to me . This appetite that I had lost , and this jealousy , once more has been reawakened . I give you my thanks ! Cutie Honey ! The I System and your body , will become one with me . You will be able to live for eternity with me . That 's fine . But in exchange , release Nat-chan . As you wish . Save Nat-chan . Help Nat-chan ... . Save Nat-chan , please ... . Nat-chan , save Nat-chan . Please , save Nat-chan . Stop . Stop it ! Stop it ... HONEY ! HONEY ! HONEY ! Don 't give up , Honey ! Activate the I System ! And believe ! Believe in Professor Kisaragi ! In your father 's love ! It 's no use . Ms. Honey is already being assimilated into Mistress Jill . She has already been received into Jill 's breast . Yes , Truly wonderful ! Hey you , you got a gun ? I have this . There 's one bullet . That 's more than enough . Honey ! I take it back ! Let 's work together ! Your choker ! HONEY FLASH ! I see , This is my father 's love . I do not understand . I who have shed the weakness of humans and thrown out love , I guided your perfect existence , why waste it ? This feeling , Is this is your heart and soul ? It 's not just mine . It 's everyone 's . It 's everyone 's feeling of love . Love , is it ? How can I posses it ? That feeling , is beyond my comprehension . It 's simple . All you need to do is to love something . Thank you , Papa . Later ! Honey ! Are you okay ? You 're safe , I 'm glad ! Honey ! That 's the first time I heard my name like that , it makes me happy . You can 't cry , You don 't like women that cry , right ? To live for eternity , the tiring days , Tiring days of gazing upon the unchanging people 's foolishness . Ms. Honey ! You will live for eternity , you too will eventually become the same . You will come to know the agony . That won 't happen . Because ... these people ... and this world ... I love them ! I see . Be going along , Ms. Honey . I ... will serve Mistress Jill ... for eternity . It 's over now . No ... . there 's still your identity . That anti-nano-machine thing you used back there , It was really for capturing Honey , wasn 't it ? Correct . Honey , careful ! Who he really is is ... . I know ! Um , something like ... An American NSA agent , right ? You knew and still ? Well ' cause ... he said he was on my side ! Thank you , Honey ! Chief ! Chief ! Chief ! You guys ... you really helped me out . Thank you , Tokimura . and Mikami . I 'll say it again , Thank you , Honey . Gee ... I didn 't really do much ... . But Nat-chan , You 're cute when you smile ! Agreed ! So , what are you going to do now ? Well , let 's see ... How about if we start a detective agency , Honey ? Of course ! It sounds great ! Thank you Honey ! And so , I 'll be counting on you ! You 'll only get jobs following unfaithful people . But ... I guess it can 't be helped . Now that that 's decided , Time to get to work ! I 'll introduce you . This is Mr. Tokimura . Pleased to meet you . Likewise . This is Mikami . Good to meet you . We 're now planning to open a detective agency . I see ! Our business will be , finding lost cats . Yes ! Honey , what are you doing ? Come over here ! Over here ! Yeah !

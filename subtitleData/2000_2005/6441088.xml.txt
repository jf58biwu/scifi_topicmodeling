Yes , although I think that it was a test that has something to do with telepathy . I heard a girl 's voice , but ... A girl ? I 've finished treating him . He needs rest , but he 's not going to die . Thank goodness ! Well , he is a stubborn bastard , after all . Please let me leave Leonid and Asuka here . What about you ? I 'm going to do some sightseeing at Gald 's newest landmark . Yuuki ... Who are you ? Wait ! He 's ... If I bring her here , you 'll return Shin-lu to normal , right ? If you 're going to bring a patient , then come in through the door . I 'll do that next time . This is Shin-lu 's memory data , right ? I 'm going to bring Shin-lu here . Wait , Shen-long , I 'm going with ... Don 't ! Wait , Shen-long , I 'm going with ... Don 't ! I don 't know how much damage Kai is going to inflict in order to get back his little sister . Hold on a second ! You know Kai ? in order to get back his little sister . Hold on a second ! You know Kai ? Where is he ? He 's gone on ahead . Umm ... Umm ... we 'll be waiting ... all of us ... What is with you ? We 'll be waiting . Right . Of course I 'll be coming back ! Asuka ... Is there something wrong with him ? Yeah ... I think ... Shall we head out too ? Yes , let 's hurry . Shin-lu ! If you disappear , then my fate will change ! Fate ? That 's why I 'm doing this ! It looks like you 've gotten a little better at this . But you 're still not as good as I am ! Shin-lu ... Oh my , little brother ... People without permission are forbidden beyond this point . I only have business with Shin-lu . What ? Please come with me . We 're in the middle of a mission . Come on , just come with me ! I don 't get it . I want to return you to being the Shin-lu that I know ! What are you saying ? I 'm me . I 'll take you with me , even if I have to use force ! Oh my , oh my , what are you planning on doing ? It 's all right , I 'll do it . He 's always been like this . He 's impertinent . No matter what ... I 'm going to turn you back , no matter what . Die ! Maxim ... did you really think all this was okay ? More so than one such as you , who 's had the truth taken away from him ! Wait ! Finish me off . I only came here to get Hikaru back . Kai ! Kai ! You idiot ! What do you want ? ! They both scream so nicely . Oh dear . Shin-lu , I 'll leave this to you . Hikaru ... From here on , we 're going to go our separate ways , Maria . Yes . I 'll look for Grandfather . And I 'll search for Kai . Well , then . Maria ! Well , then . Maria ! Maria ! Huh ? Huh ? Don 't do anything reckless . You either . I can use my powers , and yet ... Is this a trap ? That 's not the way ! The shadow of the right pillar ! Keep going forward , just like that ! That 's it , right there . The girl you 're looking for is there . You 're going to come back to us , right , Kai ? Hurry , Kai ! That girl will get tired of waiting ! Thank you , everyone . You called me a fool . Will that fate be changed ? It 's up to you . My fate is unchanged , and I 'm as I was ... Who am I ? I 'll be taking back my grandfather . This is simply a part that has been installed into this system . Just like me . Is that how you live your life ? It would have been better if I had never met this old man . The past can 't be changed . That 's the fate of all things that are born possessing life . Fine , then . Kill me and achieve your goal . I will change my fate ! Hikaru ! Hikaru ... Kai ! So it 's you . Eiji ! Kai ! So it 's you . Eiji ! This is a place that 's been called the Sacrament of Calvaria . The appearance of psychics isn 't accidental . It 's because of the influence of this land of Calvaria . It would be correct to say that it 's the will of this planet . The will of the Earth ? Right now , this only operates locally , but it 's a plant which will amplify that power and transmit it throughout the world . When this activates , humans will be reborn as psychics . By my estimate , not even ten percent of humanity will be left . The chosen ones will survive ; the rest will die . Eiji ! Psychics and humans should be able to live together ! They don 't deserve to live in the new era . A shield like that won 't ... I 've finally caught you , Shin-lu ... Shen-long , why are you ... Let go , let go of me ! You idiot ! If you 're bent on refusing to cooperate , then I 'll take back the wings that I gave to you . Those were originally hers , you see . And thus , Hikaru 's powers will amplify the power of the Sacrament of Calvaria , and unleash it on the entire world . I won 't let you make Hikaru into a tool for murdering people ! When it 's all over , I can return your true memories to you . Even without them ... Even without them , the memories I have from my time in Gald are mine ! Are you all right , Kai ? Yuuki , why ? So he 's your friend ? Your human one . How about you give back the old man 's will ? Do you mean this ? It has no value anymore . The history of mankind is going to end today , right now . Yuuki , please , take Hikaru and escape from here ! Damn , I guess I have no choice . It 's useless . Damn ! What is this ? Which is it ? Damn , is this it ? Big ... brother ... Is this it ? Hikaru , escape with him ! Big brother ? Escape ? Why ? Hikaru , which of us will you choose ? Stop it ! Kai ! Big brother ! Kai ! Big brother ! If you go with Kai , you will continue to be hurt for the rest of your life . Just like I promised , I 've prepared a gingerbread house for you . Why are you being mean to my big brother ? Kai can 't go into the gingerbread house . In that case , I 'm going to go with my big brother ! Hikaru ... Yuuki , I 'm counting on you . Wait ! What about my big brother ? And what about big brother Eiji ? You 'll be able to see them again later . It 's useless , Kai ! The entirety of this geofront 's equipment are devices to amplify Hikaru 's powers ! Unfortunately , this path is closed off , brother of Asuka . Get out of the way , you ! I 'm sorry , but you 'll have to hand that girl over quietly . My father left behind something very interesting . I never thought that I would be able to understand it . I never thought that I would be so obsessed with something , or be bothered by the fact that feelings that I wasn 't sure existed were fading day by day ... Or that desire or conflict would ever be born inside of me ... What are you saying ? Oh yes , that 's right . I forgot . I 'm giving this back to you . I 'm grateful , Kai . If I hadn 't met you two , I would have been alone . What 's wrong ? What the heck ? ! Hey ! Grandfather ! That girl ... is crying . The Sacrament of Calvaria has awakened ! Big brother ! Big brother ! It 's all right . It 's all right , so ... It 's all right now . Hikaru ... Eiji ! Let 's stop this already ... Don 't stop me , Kai ! Eiji ! Let 's live together again , big sister ... Kai ... Two powers of differing kinds collided , and caused this annihilation . That is the research group 's opinion . What about the head of development , Eiji Sagimiya ? His whereabouts are still unknown . The scene of the occurrence is still in danger of collapsing , so it is difficult to investigate it . We should give up on the redevelopment of Gald , then . We 're also going to completely halt all psychic research . Eiji , what did you really want to do ? This is where I first met Kai . My big brother is going to come back , right ? Yes . He promised , after all . Right !

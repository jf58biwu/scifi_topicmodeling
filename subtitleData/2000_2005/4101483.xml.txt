 RIDDICK : They say most of your brain shuts down in cryo-sleep . All but the primitive side , the animal side . No wonder I 'm still awake . Transporting me with civilians . Sounded like 40 , 40-plus . Heard an Arab voice , some hoodoo holy man , probably on his way to New Mecca . But what route ? What route ? Smelled a woman . Sweat , boots , tool belt , leather . Prospector type . Free settlers . And they only take the back roads . And here 's my real problem . Mr. Johns , the blue-eyed devil . Planning on taking me back to slam , only this time he picked a ghost lane . A long time between stops . A long time for something to go wrong . ( CLANGING ) ( ZIPPING ) ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) ( CLANGING ) ( ZIPPING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( RAPID BEEPING ) ( CLANGING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( COUGHING ) Why did I fall on you ? He 's dead . The captain 's dead . I was looking right at him . The chrono shows we are 22 weeks out so gravity was not supposed to kick in for another 19 . Why 'd I fall at all ? Did you hear what I said ? The captain 's dead . ( ELECTRICITY BUZZING ) ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) 1550 millibars , dropping 20 mb per minute . Shit ! We 're hemorrhaging air . Something took a swipe at us . Come on . Just tell me we 're still in the shipping lane . Just show me all those stars . Come on ! Those big , bright ... ( ALARM BLARING ) What ? OWENS : This is an emergency dispatch from merchant vessel Hunter Gratzner en route to the Tangier system with 40 commercial passengers onboard . ON MIKE : We have been knocked out of our shipping lane and are entering the atmosphere of a planetary body in this position , X-38-stroke-5 , Y-95-stroke-8 , Z-21 ... ( RUMBLING ) Fry , where the hell 's our comms ? ( GRUNTS ) ( FRY GASPING ) COMPUTER 1 : Rate of descent beyond known limits . They trained you for this , Fry , right ? ( ALARM BEEPING ) COMPUTER 2 : Deploy lower air brakes now . COMPUTER 1 : Center of gravity too far aft . Recommend purging ballast now . What the ... Was that a purge , Fry ? Too heavy in the ass . I can 't get my fucking nose down . OWENS : Crisis program selected number two because it shows some oxygen . Maximum terrain 220 meters over mean surface , largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporite deposits . ( THUDDING ) What the hell are you doing ? I gotta drop more load . I tried everything else . I still got no horizon . Better try everything twice , ' cause we don 't just flush out ... If you know something I don 't , get up here and take the chair . Company says we are responsible for every single one of those people . What , we both die out of sheer fucking nobility ? Don 't you touch that handle , Fry ! ( CLANGING ) I 'm not gonna die for them . COMPUTER 1 : Air-lock doors not secure . Owens ! Seventy seconds , Fry . You still have 70 seconds to level this beast out . Shit . Shit ! COMPUTER 1 : Air lock doors now . Air-lock doors not secure . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) What the fuck is happening up there ? ( ALARM BLARING ) ( WIND HOWLING ) ( CRASHING ) ( MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( WOMAN YELLING ) ( PEOPLE COUGHING ) ALI : Imam ? SHAZZA : Zeke ? ( WHIP LASHING ) ( GUN COCKING ) Somebody 's gonna get hurt one of these days . It ain 't gonna be me . ( METAL CLANKING ) ( GRUNTING ) ZEKE : Here , Shazza . So I guess something went wrong . ( THUDDING ) I 'm sorry . Get it out of me ! ( SHUDDERING ) Don 't touch it ! Don 't you touch that handle ! ZEKE : Get it out of him ! No , it 's too close to his heart . There 's Anestaphine in the med-lock in the back of the cabin . ( OWENS GROANING ) Not anymore , there 's not . Get out of here , everyone . ( OWENS GROANING ) Get out of here . ( MOANING ) ( PRAYING IN ARABIC ) That 'll teach me for flying coach . Interesting . PARIS : Is anyone else having difficulties breathing ? SHAZZA : Yeah , I feel one lung short . All of us . JACK : I feel like I just ran or something . There was talk of a scouting party looking for other people , but then we saw this . What the bloody hell happened ? FRY : It could have been a meteor storm . Might have been a rogue comet . I don 't know . I , for one , am thoroughly grateful . This beast wasn 't made to land like this , but I think you did well . Actually , the only reason we 're alive is because of her . Yes , I suppose you 're right . Thanks very much . JACK : Yeah , thanks for saving our dicks . PARIS : No , really . Thanks awfully . SHAZZA : Well done . JOHNS : He just escaped from a maximum prison . So do we just keep him locked up forever ? Well , that would be my choice . ( WHISPERS ) Is he really that dangerous ? ( SCOFFS ) Only around humans . PARIS : The whole bloody container 's upside down . It 's all topsy-turvy . Thank God it 's not a total loss . Booze ? This is what you have to drink ? I 'll need a receipt for that , for all of these . This is my personal stuff . FRY : I don 't suppose this will help you at all . Unfortunately it is not permitted , especially while on hajj . You do realize there 's no water , don 't you ? All deserts have water . It only waits to be found . I hope you 're right . All the more for me then . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GRUNTING ) Motherfucker . FRY : What the hell are these ? Maratha war picks from northern India . Very rare . And this ? That 's a hunting blow-dart pipe from northern Papua New Guinea . That 's very , very rare since the tribe is now extinct . ZEKE : They couldn 't hunt shit with these things , would be my guess . What 's the point anyway ? If the man is gone , he 's gone . Why should he bother us ? JOHNS : Maybe to take what you got . Maybe to work your nerves . Or maybe to just come back and skull-fuck you in your sleep . He sounds like a charmer . For you . Let 's just get ... Here we go . Yeah ? Yeah . Imam , if we 're looking for water , we should leave soon , before nightfall , while it 's cooler . Ali . Excuse me . I think you should see this . Three suns ? Bloody hell . So much for your nightfall . So much for my cocktail hour . We take this as a good sign . A path , direction from Allah . blue sun , blue water . Ever wondered why I 'm an atheist ? It 's a bit of a bad sign . That 's Riddick 's direction . I thought you found his restraints over there , towards sunset . Right . Which means he went towards sunrise . Zeke . Fully loaded clip . Safety 's on . One shot if you spot him , okay ? Don 't tell me you 're going , too . Yeah . What happens if Mr. Riddick spots us first ? There 'll be no shots . ( IMAM CHANTING IN ARABIC ) JOHNS : Quiet ! ( SHUSHING ) ( HASSAN SHOUTING ) Seven stones to keep the devil at bay . You 're on a trip to New Mecca , right ? Once in every lifetime , should there be a great hajj . A great pilgrimage . To get to know Allah better ? Yes , but to know yourself , as well . Yeah . We are all on the same hajj now . ( GASPS ) ( GUN CLICKING ) Sorry . So did you see anything ? No Riddick . Trees , and trees mean water . Trees , and trees mean water . You comfy up there ? You can do without necessities , provided you have the luxuries . Just keep your bloody eyes open . I don 't want that dog sneaking up on my bloody ass . Yes , well , you dig the graves . I 'll hold the fort , old boy . Christ ! He could probably get you right here , under the jaw , and you 'd never hear him coming , 'cause that 's how good Riddick is . Did you run away from your parents or did they run away from you ? ( ALI AND IMAM SPEAKING ARABIC ) IMAM : It 's a communal graveyard , perhaps , like the elephants of Earth . ( ALI SPEAKING ARABIC ) He asks what could have killed so many great things . Is this whole planet dead ? Drink ? Probably shouldn 't do this . It dehydrates you even more . You 're probably right . You could have stayed back at the ship . Probably should 've . If we don 't find water , you know what happens . I wanted to get away . I 've never seen a captain so ready to leave her ship . I think we should keep moving . What did Owens mean about not touching the handle ? It 's just between you and me , Carolyn . I promise . I 'm not your captain . During the landing , when things were at their worst , Owens was at his best . He stopped the docking pilot from dumping the main cabin . The passengers . And the docking pilot being ? I guess I 'm a little more glad to be here than I thought . ( GUN CLICKING ) Hassan . Suleiman . ( SPEAKING ARABIC ) Captain . ( SPEAKING ARABIC ) ( TOY WHIRRING ) ( ALI SHOUTING IN ARABIC ) FRY : Is there anyone here ? ( RATTLING ) There was water here . Lights ? Lights on ? Okay . ( SPEAKING ARABIC ) They are saying God is great . Allahu Akbar . Yes . This is the source of the water . No darkness . No lights because no darkness . ( FRY WHOOPING ) Hello , Mecca ! ( CLANGING ) Tell me that was you just now . What are you going on about ? He 's been right here helping me . Back of the ship . That noise . ( CLANGING ) You trying to tell me that was someone else ? ( INAUDIBLE ) No ! ( GASPS ) Oh , my God . I thought I was the only one who got out of the crash alive . ( GUN FIRING ) PARIS : Christ ! It was somebody else . It was just somebody else from the crash ! Crikey . I thought it was him . I thought it was Riddick . No juice . It looks like it 's been laid up for years . We might be able to adapt it to ... Shut up . Sorry . I thought I heard something . Like what ? Gunshots . ( PANTING ) ( RUSTLING ) ( GUN FIRING ) ( ZEKE SCREAMING ) ( GUN FIRING ) Zeke ! JOHNS : Piece of shit ! What did you do to Zeke ? What did you do to him ? Just kill him . Just somebody goddamn kill him before he ... So where 's the body ? Well , do you want to tell me about the sounds ? Look , you told Johns you heard something . That 's fine . You don 't want to talk to me , that 's your choice , but just so you know there 's a debate as to whether we should leave you here to die . RIDDICK : You mean the whispers ? What whispers ? Telling me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine , fourth lumbar down , the abdominal aorta . It 's a metallic taste , human blood . Copperish . If you cut it with peppermint schnapps , it goes away ... Do you want to shock me with the truth now ? All you people are so scared of me . Most days , I 'd take that as a compliment . But it ain 't me you gotta worry about now . Show me your eyes , Riddick . You 'd have to come a lot closer for that . Closer . ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) Where the hell can l get eyes like that ? You gotta kill a few people . Okay , I can do it . Then you gotta get sent to a slam where they tell you you 'll never see daylight again . You dig up a doctor and you pay him 20 menthol Kools to do a surgical shine job on your eyeballs . So you can see who 's sneaking up on you in the dark ? Exactly . Leave ! Leave . Cute kid . Did I kill a few people ? Sure . Did I kill Zeke ? No . You got the wrong killer . He 's not in the hole . We looked . Look deeper . JOHNS : Let me tell you what I think happened . I think he went off on the guy , buried him in the hills . Now he 's got you believing there 's something there . Well , let 's just be sure . Look , murders aside , Riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame . He loves to jaw-jack and loves to make you feel afraid , because that 's all he has . You 're playing right into it . Why try to explain this to you ? You 're a cop . For God 's sake , we 've got to find his body . Hey ! I 'll go . Look , no one is going . Stay here . Look , being ballsy with your life doesn 't change what came before . It 's stupid . What , do you think I 'm trying to prove something ? Well , are you ? They 're hollow . ( RUSTLING ) ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) ( CLATTERING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( FRY SCREAMING ) FRY : I 'm in here ! I 'm in here . I 'm inside ! I thought I heard something . Please , can you hear me ? ( INDISTINCT SHOUTS ) ( BANGING ) Help me . ( FRY SCREAMING ) ( BANGING ) Give me your goddamn hand . JACK : I heard you , Fry . I heard you first . IMAM : Come on . JACK : Fry , are you okay ? JACK : What 's down there ? What is it ? SHAZZA : Did you find Zeke ? JOHNS : You 're all right . JACK : Fry , are you okay ? JOHNS : Okay . Fuck ! That was so fucking stupid . I don 't know what the fuck is in there , but whatever it is , it got Zeke and it nearly got me ! ( SCREAMING ) Get it off me ! IMAM : Watch it . Watch your head . Finally found something worse than me , huh ? JOHNS : So here 's the deal . You work without chains , without bit , and without shivs . You do what I say , when I say it . For what ? The honor of going back to some asshole of a cell ? Fuck you . The truth is I 'm tired of chasing you . Are you saying you 'd cut me loose ? I 'm thinking you could have died in the crash . My recommendation . Do me . Don 't take the chance that I 'll get shiv-happy on your wanna-be ass . Okay . Ghost me . That 's what I 'd do to you . ( CHAINS RATTLING ) I want you to remember this moment . The way it could have gone and didn 't . Here . Take it easy . Fuck you ! Do we have a deal ? I want you to remember this moment . Just one ? For now . Click your fingers , and he 's one of us now ? I didn 't say that , but at least this way , I don 't have to worry about y 'all falling asleep and not waking up . So , can I talk to him now ? BOTH : No . Blast . Paris P. Ogilvie . Antiquities dealer , entrepreneur . Richard B. Riddick . Escaped convict , murderer . That 's ... That 's a particularly good Shiraz . It 's ... It 's a lovely drop . It 's ... It 's very expensive . By all means , please help yourself . I mean , normally I can appreciate antiques . But this , this is something else . It 'll work . It 's nothing we can 't repair , so long as the electrical adapts . Well , it 's not a star-jumper . RIDDICK : It doesn 't need to be . Take a two-seater like this back up to the Sol-Track shipping lanes . Stick out her thumb , bound to get picked up . Ain 't that right , captain ? Can I have a little help here ? I got it . Come on . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Do me a favor . Check these containers out and , uh , see what we can patch these wings up with . All right ? ( SQUEAKING ) ( CHUCKLING ) ( SPEAKING ARABIC ) Insha Allah ! All right , all right . My turn . Are you all right ? ( SPEAKING ARABIC ) Okay . ( WHIRRING ) ( BEEPING ) And we are getting there . So we 've got enough power for a sys-check , but we 'll still need more cells . How many are we talking about ? Um . Let 's see , we got a 90-gig draw . The other ship takes 20-gig cells . That would be five . Five total to launch . Thirty-five kilos each , huh ? Fuck . Well , that 's pretty heavy . Well , you know that old sand cat out there ? Mmm-hmm . I might be able to get it going . Yeah . Do it if you can , but if you need a hand ... Where did Riddick go ? Let 's go . ( JOHNS WHISTLING ) You 're missing the party . Come on , boy . ( GASPING ) You 're missing the party . Come on . Oh , man . ( IMAM PRAYING IN ARABIC ) All praises be Allah , for His many blessings to us . What ? It 's the winner of the look-alike contest . ( PANEL BEEPING ) Who were these people , miners ? Looks like geologists . An advance team , moves around from rock to rock . Nice of them to leave so much stuff here . Why 'd they leave their ship ? ( FLUTTERING ) It 's not a ship , it 's a skiff . And it 's disposable , really . It 's more like an emergency life raft , right ? Yeah , they probably had a big drop ship take them off planet . These people didn 't leave . Come on . Whoever got Zeke got them . They 're all dead . You don 't really think they left with their clothes on the hooks , photos on the shelves . Maybe they had weight limits . You don 't know . I know you don 't prep your emergency ship unless there 's a fucking emergency . He 's fucking right . Watch your mouth . He 's just saying what we 're all thinking . So what happened ? Where are they ? Has anyone seen the little one ? Ali ? Has anyone checked the coring room ? ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) ( ALI SCREAMING ) Ali . JOHNS : Come on . ( SCREAMING ) ( PANTING ) ( FLUTTERING ) ( GUN FIRING ) JOHNS : Slowly . FRY : Jack , wait . Wait ! Ali ? Ali ? Ali ? ( GASPING ) ( FLUTTERING ) ( CREAKING ) ( IMAM YELLING ) ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) JOHNS : Imam ? Imam ? ( IMAM CHANTING IN ARABIC ) RIDDICK : Other buildings weren 't secure , so they ran here . Heaviest doors . Thought they 'd be safe inside , but they forgot to lock the cellar . Here . What , it 's broken ? No . There 's still a few hits . Actually , you asshole , I 'm trying to say that I 'm sorry . Okay , let 's board this place up and get the hell out of here . Whatever the fuck those things were , they seem to stick to darkness . So , if we stick to daylight , we should be all right , okay ? Let 's go . Twenty-two years ago . What ? These coring samples are dated . Last one 's 22 years ago this month . Is there something special about that , Carolyn ? I don 't know . There could be . An eclipse . You 're not afraid of the dark , are you ? So we gotta get the power cells . I 've still gotta check the hull and patch the wings . Wait on the power cells . Until it 's too dark to get back ? We don 't know when it 'll happen . Let 's not get overexcited . Just get the fucking cells here , Johns . What is the discussion ? Maybe I should tell you how Riddick escaped . FRY : He can pilot ? JOHNS : He hijacked a prison transport , made a run before I tracked him down . FRY : Okay , maybe that 's a good thing . We can use him to help us navigate . JOHNS : He also figured out how to kill the pilot . You told me we could trust him . You said that we had a deal , Johns . You may have noticed that chains don 't work on this guy . The only way you people are safe is if he believes he 's going free . Let 's say he stops believing ... You mean if he realizes we 'll fuck him over . Just listen to me for a second . If we bring the cells up at the last possible minute when the wings are ready and we 're ready to launch ... He hasn 't harmed any of us . He hasn 't even lied to us . Let 's just stick to the deal . He 's a killer . The law says he has to do his bid . There 's nothing I can do about that . You hear me ? You 're dancing on razor blades here . I 'm not gonna give him a chance to grab another ship or slash another pilot 's throat . Not on my watch . ( VOMITING ) RIDDICK : Bad sign . Shaking like that in this heat . I thought I said no shivs . RIDDICK : This ? This is just a personal grooming appliance . Thanking you . RIDDICK : Looks like we 're a few shy . Power cells . They 're coming . It 's strange , not doing a run-up on the main drive yet . Unless ... Unless he told you the particulars of my escape . I got the quick and ugly version . You 're worried about a repeat of history . It has entered our minds . I asked what you thought . You scare me , Riddick . That 's what you want to hear , isn 't it ? Now can I just get back to work ? I 've been meaning to catch up with you alone , unrestrained . Do you think ... You think Johns is a do-right man ? Think I can trust him to cut me loose ? Why ? What did you hear ? Well , guess if it were trickeration , he 'd just " X " me out , huh ? He 'd kill me . Then again , I am worth twice as much alive . Oh , you didn 't know that ? Your Johns ain 't a cop . He 's got that nickel-slick badge , and that blue uniform , but he 's just a merc . And I 'm just a payday . That 's why he won 't kill me , see ? The creed is greed . Don 't waste my time . We 're not gonna turn on each other , no matter how hard you try . ( FLICKING SWITCHES ON PANEL ) I don 't know what 's gonna happen when the lights go out , Carolyn . But I do know once the dying starts this little psycho-fuck family of ours is gonna rip itself apart . Ever wonder why Johns shakes like that ? Ask him . Ask why your crew pal had to scream so painfully before he died . ( WHIRRING ) So who are you , really ? You 're not a cop , are you ? I never said I was . No , you didn 't . You never said you were a hype , either . You have caffeine in the morning , I have a little morphine . So what ? You got two mornings every day . Wow , you were born lucky . It 's not a problem unless ... No , it becomes a problem when you let Owens die like that . We have enough drugs here to knock out a fucking mule team . Owens was already dead . His brain just hadn 't caught on to the facts . Is there anything else I should know about you , Johns ? You know , I ... I 'm letting you roll the dice on our lives . It is not unreasonable ... Do you feel that ? That 's my first run-in with Riddick . He went for the sweet spot and missed . They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there , Carolyn , and I can feel it pressing against the cord . So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve endings is my business . It 's just that you could 've done something , and you didn 't . Yeah , well , look to thine own ass first . Right , Carolyn ? HASSAN : Captain ! Captain ! ( SPEAKING ARABIC ) I 'm not your fucking captain . What are my eyes seeing ? If we need anything from the crash ship , I suggest we kick on . That sand cat 's solar . Where 's Riddick ? Leave him . He wouldn 't wait for us . Thought we 'd lost you . Johns ! ( GRUNTING ) Hey ! Where are you going ? I 'm just gonna get a couple things . I 'll only be a few minutes . You wouldn 't leave without me , would you ? ( SULEIMAN SPEAKING ARABIC ) JACK : Shit . ( WIND HOWLING ) ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) How many are there ? Beautiful . Allah . People , just a suggestion . Perhaps you should flee ! Let 's go ! IMAM : Come on , run ! Shit ! Come on ! ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) FRY : Get in ! Get down ! ( SHAZZA GRUNTING ) No . Stay there ! Stay down ! Come back here ! ( SCREECHING ) ( SHAZZA GRUNTING ) Shazza , stay down ! ( SHAZZA SCREAMING ) PARIS : Please , I really think we should go inside . We have to be inside to be able to close the door . Let 's go ! ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) ( RUMBLING ) What is it , Riddick ? What is it now ? Like I said , it ain 't me you gotta worry about . JACK : She should 've stayed down . If she 'd only stayed down , she 'd be okay . She wouldn 't have died . JOHNS : You remember the boneyard ? These just might be the fuckers that killed every living thing on this planet . JACK : What are we gonna do now ? PARIS : Are these the only lights we have ? Is this everything ? FRY : There 's a cutting torch on the floor . I just can 't find it . IMAM : Quiet , please , everyone . ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) JACK : Why do they do that , make that sound ? IMAM : Perhaps it 's the way they see , with sound reflecting back ... ( RATTLING ) FRY : Could be a breach in the hull . I don 't know . RIDDICK : Come on , Johns . You got the big gauge . JOHNS : I 'd rather piss glass . Why don 't you go fucking check ? PARIS : I 'm not staying here anymore . JOHNS : Where you going ? Hey ! JOHNS : Sit him down . You don 't know what 's out there . I know what 's in here . ( IMAM GRUNTING ) ( IMAM SPEAKING ARABIC ) IMAM : Hurry ! PARIS : Now we 're trapped in a much smaller space . I hate this ! ( IMAM SCREAMING ) ( GUN FIRING ) ( THUDDING ) ( CLANGING ) ( HASSAN GASPING ) Extremely bad timing . Just don 't run . Riddick ? Don 't stop burning . Take this . JOHNS : Take that . ( METALLIC GRATING ) IMAM : Hassan . Where is Hassan ? ( CREATURE SCREECHES ) ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) ( SLURPING ) ( SQUEALING ) ( YELLING ) ( SQUEALING ) ( GUN FIRING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) FRY : Is it alive ? ( SIZZLING ) PARIS : It 's like the light is scalding it . It hurts them . Light actually hurts them . ( GASPING ) ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) Hassan ? JOHNS : We 'll burn a candle for him later . Let 's get out of here . ( THUDDING ) FRY : So we got one cutting torch , we got two hand lights . There 's gotta be something we can rip out of the crash ship . PARIS : Spirits . Anything over 45 proof burns rather well . FRY : How many bottles you got ? PARIS : I don 't know . Maybe 10 . Okay , Johns , you got some flares . So , maybe we 've got enough light . Enough for fucking what ? We stick to the plan . We get the four cells back to the skiff , we 're off this rock . PARIS : I hate to ruin a beautiful theory with an ugly fact , but that sand cat is solar . It won 't run at night . So we carry the cells . We drag them , whatever it takes . You mean tonight , with all those things still out there ? All right , how long can this last ? A few hours ? A day , tops ? I have the impression from the model . The two planets were moving as one and there would be a lasting darkness . JOHNS : These suns gotta come up sometime . If these creatures are phobic about light , we just sit tight and let the sun come up . I 'm sure somebody else said that , locked inside that coring room . We need to think about everyone now , especially the kid . How scared will he be in the dark ? Don 't use him like that . Like what ? As a smoke screen . You deal with your own fear . Shut your mouth for two seconds and let me come up with a plan that doesn 't involve mass suicide . ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) I 'm waiting . How much you weigh , Johns ? What 's it matter , Carolyn ? How much ? Around 79 kilos . 'Cause you 're 79 kilos of gutless white meat . That 's why you can 't think ... Is that fucking right ? Where are you going ? This solves nothing . Okay . They 're afraid of our light . That means we don 't have to be so afraid of them . And you are sure you can get us there , even in the dark ? No , I can 't . But he can . ( WHISPERING ) Stay close . Okay , wait . Wait ! ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) Riddick . Looks clear . ( SCREECHING ) You said " clear . " I said it looks clear . What 's it look like now ? Looks clear . I 'll be running about ten paces ahead . I want light on my back , but not my eyes . And check your cuts . These bad boys know our blood now . Are we actually going to do this ? We stay together , we keep the light burning . That 's all we gotta do to live through this thing . Are you ready , Johns ? JOHNS : Yeah . Look , we 're just wasting light here . You give him the cells and the ship and he 'll leave you all out there to die . He 'll leave all of you . I don 't get it , Johns . What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you 're worried about losing ? Is there anything at all besides your next spike ? ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) Stay close . FRY : Wait . Jack ! ( CREATURE SCREECHING ) ( SHOUTING ) Jack ! ( GASPS ) PARIS : This can 't be happening . Paris ! Get back here ! IMAM : Are you all right ? PARIS : This can 't be happening . ( CREATURE HISSING ) I was supposed to die in France . I never even saw France . ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) Well , it 's good to see you 're okay . ( SQUAWKING ) Do I even wanna know ? ( PANTING ) Are we getting close ? Can we pick up the pace ? ( SULEIMAN SPEAKING ARABIC ) JOHNS : Wanna tell me what the hell 's going on ? We crossed our own tracks . Why have we circled ? Are we lost ? Listen . Do you even know where we are ? Listen ! ( FLUTTERING ) Canyon ahead . I circled once to buy some time to think . I think we should go now . I don 't know about that . That 's death row up there . Especially with the girl bleeding . IMAM : What ? What are you talking about ? She 's not cut . Not her . Her . You 've gotta be kidding me . I thought it 'd be better if people took me for a guy . I thought they 'd leave me alone instead of always messing with me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , sweetheart . Are you really bleeding ? You could 've left me at the ship , Fry . That 's why I didn 't say anything sooner . They 've been nose-open for her ever since we left . In case you haven 't noticed , they go off blood . Look , this is not gonna work . We 're gonna have to go back . What 'd you say ? You got us out here in the first place . FRY : I was wrong . I admit it . Can we just get back to the ship ? I don 't know , Carolyn . Nice breeze , wide-open space . I 'm starting to enjoy my fucking self . What , are you high again ? Just listen to yourself , Johns . You 're right . What 's to be afraid of ? My life is a steaming pile of meaningless shit anyhow , so I say mush on . The canyon 's a couple hundred meters , after that it 's skiff city . So why don 't you butch up , stuff a cork in this fucking kid , and let 's go . IMAM : She is the captain . We should listen to her . Listen to her ? She was willing to sacrifice us all . What 's he talking about ? This does not help us . During the crash she tried to blow the passenger cabin , kill us in our sleep . Shut your mouth . We 're fucking disposable . We 're just walking ghosts to you . Shut your fucking blowhole ! IMAM : Fine . Fine ! You 've made your point . We 'll all be scared . How much do you weigh now ? The verdict 's in . The light moves forward . Ain 't all of us gonna make it . Just realize that ? Six of us left . If we made it through the canyon and lost just one , that 'd be quite a feat . Not if I 'm the one . What if you 're one of five ? ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) RIDDICK : I 'm listening . What are they doing up there ? Talking about the canyon , I suppose . How to get us through . Battlefield doctors decide who lives and dies , it 's called triage . You kept calling it murder when I did it . Either way , I figure it 's something you can grab onto . RIDDICK : Sacrifice play . Hack up a body , leave it at the start of the canyon like a bucket of bait . JOHNS : Trawl with it . We got extra cable on the sled . We drag the body 40 , 50 feet behind us . Nice embellishment . I don 't wanna feed ' em . I just wanna keep 'em off our scent . So , which one caught your eye ? Don 't look . Christ . What the hell 's wrong with you ? FRY : Slow down . Just a little more space between us and them . Enough of this shit . You do the girl , and I 'll keep the others off your back . It 's not too big a job for you , is it ? I 'm just wondering if we don 't need a bigger piece of bait . Like who ? ( GUN FIRING ) Leave the sled ! Move ! FRY : Let 's go ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( CREATURE HISSING ) RIDDICK : One rule . Stay in the light . ( GRUNTING ) Remember that moment . ( JOHNS GROANING ) You should 've never taken the chains off , Johns . You were one brave fuck before . You were really bad-ass . The chains . The gauge . The badge . I told you to ghost me . ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) ( GUN CLICKING ) ( JOHNS YELLING ) ( CRUNCHING ) ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) ( CAROLYN GASPING ) Back to the ship , huh ? Just huddle together until the lights burn out . Get away from us . Till you can 't see what 's eating you . That the big plan ? Where 's Johns ? Which half ? We 're gonna lose everybody out here . We should 've stayed at the ship . He died fast . If we have any choice , that 's the way we should all go out . Don 't you cry for Johns . Don 't you dare . Blind spot . Shall we pray together ? I have already prayed with the others . It is painless . It 's pointless . Because you do not believe in God doesn 't mean God does not believe in you . Think someone can spend half of their life in a slam with a horse bit in their mouth and not believe ? Think he could start out in some liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and not believe ? You got it all wrong , holy man . I absolutely believe in God . And I absolutely hate the fucker . He is with us , nonetheless . Two of your boys are already dead . How much faith do you have left , Father ? ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) ( THUDDING ) I only see one way . That way . It 's the only way off this rock . Just keep the girl between you . What about the cells ? I 'll take those . Move . Are you sure you can keep up ? Move ! ( GASPS ) ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) Do not look up ! FRY : They 're killing each other . ( SNARLING ) RIDDICK : Move ! Keep moving ! Keep moving ! ( SULEIMAN YELLING ) ( IMAM AND SULEIMAN SHOUTING IN ARABIC ) ( SCREECHING ) Riddick ! Wait ! ( CHATTERING ) Riddick ! ( SQUEALING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( JACK SCREAMING ) FRY : Get off her ! Get off her ! ( RIDDICK YELLING ) FRY : It 's okay . ( CREATURE WHINING ) ( CREATURE SQUEALING ) He did not know who he was fucking with . ( CREATURES WAILING ) ( SHOUTING ) FRY : Come on . IMAM : Stand up . Get up . Come on . Oh , no . ( RIDDICK LAUGHING ) So , where the hell 's your God now ? ( GROANING ) Riddick ! Are we close ? Just tell me that the settlement is right there . We can 't make it . ( SULEIMAN YELLING ) ( IMAM YELLING IN ARABIC ) ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) Hide here ! Now ! Why is he still out there ? ( CREATURES SCREECHING IN DISTANCE ) He 's not coming back , is he ? ( SCRATCHING ) ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) ( FLUTTERING ) ( ROARING ) ( SQUEALING ) ( MACHINERY WHIRRING ) That 's the last I could find . ( THUDDING ) Strong survival instinct . I admire that in a woman . I promised them that we would go back with more light . Did you ? What , are you afraid ? ( LAUGHING ) Me , afraid ? Come on , Riddick . There 's gotta be some part of you that wants to rejoin the human race . Truthfully , I wouldn 't know how . Then just give me more light for them . I 'll go back by myself . Okay . There you go . Please just come with me . I got a better idea . Come with me . You 're fucking with me , I know you are . You know I am ? You don 't know anything about me . I will leave you here . Step inside . I can 't . Sure you can . I can 't . Here , I 'll make it easy on you . Take my hand . Come on . ( SOBBING ) Look , no one 's gonna blame you . Save yourself , Carolyn . Come on . That 's it . That 's it . Good girl . ( CREATURE WAILING ) ( SCREAMING ) You listen to me ! I am the captain of this ship and I am not leaving anyone on this rock with those fucking things , even if it means ... ( FRY GRUNTING ) Get that thing off my neck . Shut up ! You 'd die for them ? I would try for them . You didn 't answer me . Yes , I would , Riddick . I would . I would die for them . How interesting . ( THUDDING ) Never had a doubt . Anyone not ready for this ? There is my God , Mr. Riddick . ( CREATURES SQUEALING ) ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) RIDDICK : Don 't stop . Don 't stop ! Come on ! Move ! You know the way ! ( SQUEALING ) On board ! Come on ! Get on ! ( SQUEALING ) Carolyn . Come . Now . ( RIDDICK YELLING ) Wait . Riddick ? ( GASPING ) ( PANTING ) Okay , hold onto me . Hold onto me . We 're gonna get out of here . I got you . Come on . Come on , Riddick ! Get up ! Get up ! I said I 'd die for them , not you . Let 's move . Come on . ( GASPING ) Not for me . Not for me ! With so much prayer to make up for , I scarcely know where to begin . I know where I 'd start . What are you doing ? ( CLANGING ) Can we just get the hell out of here now ? We can 't leave ( GASPING ) without saying good night . ( CREATURES SCREECHING ) A lot of questions , whoever we run into . Could even be a merc ship . So , what the hell do we tell them about you ? Tell ' em Riddick 's dead . He died somewhere on that planet .

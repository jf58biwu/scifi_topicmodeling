 Previously on Farscape . Radiation . Massive radiation . I 've never felt better . The , uh , other Crichton . He 's dead . I just can 't watch that happen again . We were so perfect , and you 're just like him . I mean , you are him . No , I 'm me . You give me what I want , or I swear , I will keep you alive so that you can witness your homeworld 's destruction ! I suggest you hang on to something . Talyn . Starburst . This ship is dead ! The wormhole experiment is over . Aeryn . Fly safe . We all knew the time would come when we 'd split up . In the beginning I would never have even believed it could take so long . Don 't think I 'm going to miss you . Any of you . I 'm not . Well , maybe a little bit . And now , on Farscape . Oh . It doesn 't work . Oh , yes it does . Just not for the wedding . Hey ! John ? You wear this and somebody 's gonna marry you . Come on , Crichton . I 've been to a few different places . Your world can 't be that hard to adjust to . You still have to ask her . Doesn 't work that way . Might I interject ? Would you like some yirgra fungal chowder ? Oh , well . Perhaps Aeryn wouldn 't have liked your planet anyway . Uh-uh ... - Come on . Sarge it . Ch ... Again . Ch ... Sarch it . Where 's she from ? Like Bosnia ? Charge it . Oh . Thank you . I told you . - No , look , that was good . She almost understood what you said . That was completely embarrassing . Baby , look , English is a very difficult language . Half the time people don 't understand what I 'm talking about . You 're doing great . - No , I 'm not . Nobody here understands what I 'm saying . This whole frelling planet needs translator microbes . Hey old woman , why didn 't you leave with the others ? Because I knew the souffle would charm you . Chowder , you said it was chowder . I can make you a chowder . Pip , who is that woman ? I thought she was with you . Look at this . Pilot , I 'm seeing another Leviathan . We have arrived at the Leviathan Burial Place . D 'Argo , how much are you taking ? Macton 's posting is a long way away . Thanks . You could resupply during the journey . Well revenge is a feast best served immediately . You 're going to get yourself killed . We all are . At least we 'll do it on our home planets . I 'm surprised that Crais sacrificed himself . Talyn was such a fine ship . I can 't believe this is all that 's left of him . So what are you gonna do after we bury Talyn ? Same thing I 'm doing now . Working on wormhole theory . Vision ? D - d-darkness . M - M-Moya swallowed . Pilot , is everything okay ? No , Commander . Brace for collision , everybody ! Brace for collision ! - Pilot ! Oh , praise the spirits ! I 'm never gonna finish this recipe . Oh ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Total crap . Completely dead . Pilot , how long ? Soon . Moya is rallying herself to recovery . That lunatic Leviathan 's still out there ? - Hasn 't moved . - Just staring us down . Central pumping mechanism is a total loss . Tier Three is underwater . Conduit bulkhead breach . Janz-two torpedo could not have done it better . That crazy tralk really knew where to hit us , didn 't she ? Moya 's nerval crytex is impossible to target so successfully , unless by another Leviathan . Pilot , what the yotz brought this on ? I still haven 't made contact with the other Pilot . However , it appears to have something to do with Talyn . Oh , Talyn again ? I told you we should have dumped his debris . We wouldn 't even be here . Without Talyn you wouldn 't be here . So show some respect . Respect ! My tiny , shiny heinie . It 's gonna get us killed . And who the frell is this ? One , two , three . And reroute Moya 's systems to help in the recovery process . Does everyone know what to do ? Yeah . Crichton ? Huh ? Pay attention ! This is serious . Yeah , it 's a good plan . Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . That 's my cousin Susan . - Aeryn , John . Congratulations . John . Tonight you are the second luckiest man on Earth . Know what I mean ? Though still groggy , Moya informs me that each of this Leviathan 's last three offspring were captured and enslaved by Peacekeeper hunters . And she won 't let Talyn be buried in the Sacred Space because he 's half Peacekeeper . This ship is quite irrational and as we 've seen , prepared to enforce her edict . Can 't you work this out with the other Pilot ? He has yet to return my communication , but I 'm trying . Mmm , that 's certainly true . Oh . Ahh ! Pay attention . Oh ! Fahrbot ! When we get out of this , are you still gonna look for that ex-Peacekeeper unit ? Can you keep the light on where I 'm working ? Sorry . They assassinate people , right ? The squad aims to stop terrorism and protect people . Didn 't you learn anything on the Command Carrier ? Want some advice ? Look Jool , I 'm not Crichton 's mate . I 'm not tied to him in any way . In the short time I 've known you , you 've changed so much . Don 't go backwards . Assassinating people ... seems like going backwards . Can you melt that ? With what ? There 's no power yet . Ow ... - Thank you . Hey . Hamman side 's tight . Looks like Moya 's gonna be okay . Yeah . Hey , you know ... you know what I said before about ... about not wanting you to come with me ? That wasn 't exactly right . Pip , it 's cool . Where you been ? Not now . This is not right . I would love you to come with me . But you know , I ... I gotta find my brother and he 's in this resistance thing , and ... and as if I 'm gonna find him hanging out with someone who looks like ... A Peacekeeper ? It 's cool . What are we gonna do if this crazy tralk doesn 't let Moya into the burial grounds ? Perhaps I could offer the benefit of my training . What , how ? As a chef ? And doctor . Instructor . And among many other disciplines , negotiator . Listen Wrinkles , how about you just stick to the chowder . You can deal with the old frelnik . Damn ! I can 't see ! God ! Ah ! Go to the truth . It calls in your own tongue . Ignore it and risk all . No ! Get down ! Get down ! John . What the frell happened to him ? Ah ... ah , nothing . Nothing . He 'll be fine . What did you do ? Perhaps a slight misjudgment of his weight . It won 't occur again , I 'm certain . So am I. Aeryn , D 'Argo , the Leviathan killed her own Pilot . Nutrient starvation . Why would she do that ? - I 'm not sure , but she threatens to attack again if Moya does not take Talyn 's remains and vacate the area . Never one to say I told you so , but shall we go ? Well , I can 't believe I 'm agreeing with Rygel , but under the circumstances , with Moya injured ... Moya feels Talyn has earned the right to be buried in the Sacred Space , and she will not yield . Don 't you ever get bored , living on the same planet , never going anywhere ? And what about living in a house ? It 's too quiet , there 's no engine noise . Well wait till summer , when the air conditioning kicks on . John has this fantasy about us having kids and dogs and the pool and barbecues . Must seem a strange culture . Jack , I am miserable here , and he just doesn 't see it . I 'm going to get married , end up like Betty Crocker . I just keep wondering when he 's gonna wake up . I 'm awake . You all right ? Well ... between the witch and the Luxan ... Still ? The other Leviathan killed her own pilot , and Moya won 't back down . Uh ... Can Moya beat her ? Damage is too great . We could dodge for a while , but eventually ... We have to cut and run . Pilot can 't convince her and , uh , Chiana and Rygel are trying . Sparky and Pip ? Oh ! If you untie me , I shall volunteer again to mediate , even ... even though I ... I know that , um ... Who is that woman ? - I don 't know . Listen , Moya , uh ... everyone is , uh ... is really concerned , about your plan . I ... I mean , even Aeryn thinks that ... that maybe Talyn should be laid to rest someplace else . I once , um ... I once asked Zhaan ... how ... how she got along with you so well . She ... she said that the ... that the key ... that the key was to be honest . Was to be honest . No matter what . Well , Moya ... this ... this is what I think . I think that you should bury Talyn wherever you frelling wanna bury Talyn ! And I think that ... that the frelling tralk should ... should get out of our frelling way . There . That 's what I think . Hey , Crichton . Where ya been ? What is all this ? I went shopping . Shopping ? Does this color go with my eyes ? - No , no , you don 't have any money . Lifting . Shoplifting . But look . Look at these cool presents I brought the bridesmaids . You and Aeryn can give them to ' em . Sit down . Aww ... Hey , I spent some time with the boys . Think I found who the best man is . W - w-why are you doing this ? Why can 't you just act like you always have , fit in ? Why ... why do you have to sleep with all of my friends ? Oh , this is such a repressed culture ! Back . Son . Dad . Dad ! Hi ! Dad ? Son , your mother has been gone for so long . This is not right . That 's not right . - I do not agree , John . - I think she has a point . Ya see ? - D 'Argo , you don 't even know how to fly your ship . I do , in theory . And it certainly has enough firepower to destroy a Leviathan . It 's just not right . Why does it always have to be your plan ? It doesn 't . But I don 't think that Moya is going to let us kill one of her own species . I have some information . And it 's worse than we thought . Apparently , Moya is not the first to be attacked by this rogue Leviathan . - Go on . Fly away . Go on . Three others are already dead . - Go on , shoo ! Shoo , shoo ! Still more grievously injured . Hang on ! Apologies . Moya is now responding defensively on her own . Moya understands the grief of losing a child . However , this female 's behavior is unacceptable . She asks for your help . - Yes . She has our backing no matter what . Moya knows , which is why she feels comfortable making this request . Kill the rogue Leviathan . Yes . All right , old girl . Not you . I 'll prime my ship . - Kill ? Yes , Commander . Before she kills us . So you 'll be there ? Yeah , but Chiana can handle it . - Just be there . Chiana midwifed Talyn 's birth . She shouldn 't have to bury him alone . I don 't make errors . The Leviathan can 't be stationary , but be sure it 's not moving too fast . I know . - It 's not too far but it 's not too close either . Do you want me to shoot the frelling thing myself ? Even though it 's a disturbed creature , you 're still about to take a life . Are you going to be okay with that ? Be careful . - I don 't have to fly with D 'Argo . I heard that . Now do you remember everything I told you about flying the ship ? Almost nothing . Excellent . Pilot , we are in position . Moya , it 's time Talyn was laid to rest . In the Sacred Place . Whew ... Okay , you ready ? - Yeah . We 're in . We 're in . What the yotz is so sacred about this ? All right , we 've got that rogue 's attention . She 's now following us . Yes , I see her , Rygel . Look , keep it steady . If I don 't get accurate resonant capture , then we 're all done for . I thought you said this thing only responds to your DNA . It does , that 's why I covered all the controls ... Ooh . That 's why I 'm wearing gloves . D 'Argo , Crichton . This Leviathan is a lot larger than Moya . The best I 'll be able to do is annoy her . That 's all right . Just keep her within range . We 'll give the slijnot something to focus on . As soon as I see Talyn 's remains , I shall commence a firing run . I 'm just waiting on a go ahead from D 'Argo . I understand , it 's difficult . It 's not difficult . Yes , it is . Everybody thinks you 're freak . Everyone thinks I 'm a freak . Hey boys , how are they biting ? Terrible , Mr. D 'Argo . - Can you help again ? See , they don 't think I 'm a freak . What the hell are you doing ? What do you think I 'm doing ? I 'm not entirely sure , but don 't kill Aeryn . I 'm not gonna kill anyone ! Why are you so disagreeable ? I 'm not disagreeable . I got things on my mind . - You are being disagreeable . I am sorry that Aeryn is leaving you but don 't take it out on me . I heard she left you at the altar . Shut up . - Hey ! It 's not just Aeryn . You 're all leaving . Whenever you thought you 'd found a wormhole , you fell over yourself to dive in . Don 't begrudge us our dreams . I don 't . It 's just a hell of a dream you got there , D , killing a man . I don 't want to kill him , I just want revenge . What do you think you 're doing ? Don 't horde the silver , John . I think you should head straight for Earth . No , that 's not an option . The Peacekeepers would follow . You know , I should never have come here . I should never have come to Earth . I should have left you guys on Moya . If it 's such a simple choice , why are you agonising over it ? Because I 'm an idiot . Yeah , you are an idiot . I 'm an idiot , we 're all idiots , Aren 't we , boys ? - Yeah . Everyone 's an idiot . Speaking of idiots ... That cannot be right . Ha . Yeah ! One shot . And you said I 'd never fit in here . I never said that . Yes , you did . - No , I didn 't . I remember , you did . He 's armed and he 's dangerous ! Talyn . He , uh ... he was our protector . Our family . Ah , may I say a few words ? Yeah . He was a lost soul ... searching for ... Talyn was special . A joy to his mother and a credit to his species . Both of them . With fondness , we lay Talyn , offspring of Moya , to rest in his sacred ground . The rogue is making a run at the debris . Moya pleads with you not to let her disperse Talyn 's remains . Commencing attack . - Here she comes , D 'Argo . - Right where you want her . Good job , Aeryn . She 's veering away from Talyn and chasing you . All right , let 's do it . Very effective . Did you get her ? She 's gone . Completely . Chi . They got her . You know what this means ? It means we 're done . Talyn rests where he belongs . Scorpius has no ship . We 're all unhurt , healthy and no one 's trying to kill us . It means finally , we can go where we want . We can go home . Home . We 're going home . I 'm going home . Who are you , old woman ? It doesn 't matter who I am . But I know who you are . You made them come back and rescue our lifepod after the Command Carrier imploded . I 'm no longer a prisoner because of you . So when the others got off , I stayed on Moya to repay the debt . By messing with my mind . Oh , no . No , I would never ... leave this on boil for so long . Would you like some before it ... - What did you do to me ? ! We all lie . The lies that spew outward do much less damage that the ones that stay hidden . When I was a kid , I dreamed of outer space . And then I got here , and I dream of Earth . Lately , none of my dreams work . Do you know why ? Trying to make it the way it was , the way it ... never was . Did my herbs help you ? They stripped away the lies . But I ran from it . And I am so tired of running . Show me again . Forward is the truth . It 's the lies that restrain us . You will know . May I cut in , son ? Everybody ... Everybody , I want to propose a toast to my son , and my new daughter . You all know their incredible story , the odds they had to beat , the good fortune that brought 'em home , safe and sound . So please join me in wishing the new Mr. and Mrs. Crichton all the best ... No ! - No ! No . No . No . - Get down ! See truth ! - Everybody run ! See truth . See truth . See it . Confront your fear . No . No . No , baby , no . You 're gonna be all right . You 're gonna be all right . Don 't you worry about me . I 've never felt better . No ! No , no ! No . Well , then , John . Tell me . What did you expect ? It 's a nightmare . What is ? My life . My dreams . Earth and my friends . I ... I tried to merge the two . They 're incompatible . Then choose one . I ... can 't go to Earth . And my friends are all leaving . You blame yourself . Dog with two bones . Unfamiliar . Dog . Animal . It 's a pet . He has this bone . It 's the most important thing in the world . He carries it everywhere he goes , and , uh ... one day he goes down to the water , and he sees another dog with a bone , reflected on the surface . It 's identical and he wants that bone , too . So he opens his mouth to grab it , and his bone falls in the water and it disappears . It 's gone . And he 's left standing there looking at himself . And he has nothing . Is this doag smart enough to learn ? Yeah , it 's too late . It is never ... If the doag could have had only one bone , which would it have wanted ? I 'm coming with you . No . I 'm sorry . Well , you 're not leaving without me . What do you want ? You . I 'm afraid it 's not that easy for me . You see , you died . I watched that happen , and yet you 're still alive . I have to go . Then say goodbye . We don 't say goodbyes . We do this time . You see , you leave and then you come back and I ... I can 't handle the in between , Aeryn . Say goodbye . Fine . Goodbye , Crichton . John ! My name is John . " Goodbye , John " to my face . Guarantee you won 't die in my arms again ! Guarantee me you won 't die in mine . I can by leaving ! Do you love John Crichton ? Not him . Not me . John Crichton . Yes . Then what does that taste like ? Yesterday . Huh . Well , nobody can compete with that . I am so much better dead . I can 't do this again . And I can 't let the one thing I love fly away in a crappy little ship . You once said it was as if the fates meant for us to be together . And I believe that . Well then if it 's true we will be together again . Running away is not fate , Aeryn . Running away is running away . Fine , you want fate ? Here . I 've got fate . Fate . Here . - What ? Coin toss . What , like that side up , you stay ? Absolutely . Fate . Just make a frelling wormhole and go home . There is no home . There is no wormhole . There 's only y ... Aeryn ... anywhere in the universe , you pick the planet . It 's too late for that . It 's not too late . - No , you 're not listening to me . It 's too late for me . You do this and we 'll never see each other again . Do you love Aeryn Sun ? Beyond hope . Then don 't make me say goodbye and don 't make me stay . Anything positive I do with the rest of my life will be because of you . Take care , my friend . You better not forget me . You better not ever forget that I love you . Of all the lesser species , I admit I 've grown to like yours the best . We 're in the hands of fate now . We have to trust in that . Fly safe . Goodbye , John Crichton . Crichton ? Still alive ? Out of fuel ? Uh ... Yeah , Jool , I 'm ... almost out of fuel . Pilot , I 'm heading back . The human subconscious is a fascinating place . Malleable . Permeable . Fallible . Harvey , you gotta get your nose out of the dictionary . Guess what I found there , John ? Go away . I don 't feel like talking right now . I will honor your wishes , John . However , having chosen our partnership above all else , your wellbeing is now irrevocably mine . My gift . Be forgiving . Be kind . Better angels . Her life . Her world . On her time ... you will know ... Aeryn is ... with child . Aeryn , why didn 't ya tell me ? Why didn 't you trust me ? Old woman ! Pilot ! Patch me through to Aeryn . She is beyond our range , Commander . Get a fix on her position . We 're going after her . Hold on a microt ! Damn it , just do it ! First , we 'll go to my ... aah ! Obey his command , Pilot . Pilot , please . For the love of God , please . Uh , I shall approximate Officer Sun 's vector and initiate chase upon your retrieval . Commander ! Stay clear ... We 're ... being ... pulled in ... You have got to be kidding me .

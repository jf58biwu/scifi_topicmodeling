 Looking right at us . 50 bucks says that 's Lukesh . 100 says he knows we 're here . - lt 's him . Let 's take him . - Let him get to the mailbox . It 's Lukesh. I don 't need him opening a mailbox to prove it . Patience , Agent Doggett . We got an agent alone with a psycho , a guy known for his vanishing act . We got the block surrounded . He isn 't vanishing anywhere . And your partner volunteered . Now ... open 4-D . Agent Reyes , stand by . What the hell 's this ? - Monica , don 't . - Agent Reyes , keep your distance . Don 't let him see you following . - Monica , where are you ? - Back stairwell . I 've lost sight of him . I think he might be ... Oh , no . Agent down , back stairwell . Get EMS here now . Doggett . He 's got her gun . Irwin Lukesh . Federal agent . Turn around , you son of a bitch . Back here . - Hey . - So this is how the uptown crowd lives ? This is it . Movin ' on up . So is there anything heavy I can move for you ? A dresser , a fridge ? No . But thank you , John . You just missed the movers . You don 't say . I brought you a housewarming gift . - Hot dogs ? - Polish sausage. lt 's the best in the city . There 's a stand two blocks over on M Street . You 'll be able to walk to it . Try one . It 's like I 'm back in Gdansk . - Let me get some plates . - Plates ? For cryin ' out loud . Who eats Polish sausage with plates ? Hello ? - Agent Reyes , it 's AD Skinner . - Yes , sir . There 's no easy way to say this . Sorry to do it over the phone . - What is it ? - lt 's Doggett . He 's been found in an alley off Dylan Park . He 's been shot . - What did you say ? - They 're taking him to Washington Memorial . Agent ? What you 're saying is ... Agent Reyes ? Agent Reyes ? - Excuse me ? - Monica ? - Brad ? Skinner called you too ? - He 's staying at the crime scene . I 'm sorry . I 've been put in charge of the investigation . I promise you , it 's my top priority . I will find the person who did this . I just need to find out why your partner was in that alley . He wasn 't . He was with me . At my apartment . He was with me when Skinner called me . I 'm not sure I 'm following . Monica , I 'm so sorry . Agent Doggett is just out of surgery . They 're moving him to the icu . How 's it look ? If he pulls through this ... it 's likely that he 'll be paralyzed for life . I haven 't understood one single word I 've heard since I got here . Whoever you 're talking about , it 's not John Doggett . You found the bullet . 9 millimeter slug . Found it in the alley lodged in a wall . Most likely from a SlG-Sauer P226 or 228 . Possibly fbi issue . This didn 't come from Doggett 's weapon . Ballistics don 't match and his gun was never fired . Assistant Director . I 'd appreciate case updates in a timely fashion . For instance , this bullet . How long have you had it ? An hour ? Two ? Thereabouts . It 's just that we need to keep the lines of communication open . That 's all I 'm asking . I want this slug run through our database of FBl-issue pistols . Like I told you , the round didn 't come from Doggett 's weapon . You 're not saying another agent did this ? Just run it . Please . I just ... I don 't understand how any of this is possible . He was with me , Dana . In my apartment . How can this be ? I saw something once . It 's only been the last couple of years that I 've fully come to terms with it . In ' 94 , my father passed away . And that night , I think that very moment that it happened , he came to me . I like to believe that he came to say goodbye . A visitation . I think that 's wonderful . A blessing . But that 's not what happened to me . Scully . It 's me. ls Reyes with you ? She 's here . We 're still at the hospital . I need you to bring her to the Sixth District police station . - What 's this about ? - l 'll tell you when you get there . What 's going on ? Agent Reyes , would you mind stepping inside , please ? Hi , Monica . Have a seat . I wanted you and I to have a chance to talk alone , clear a few things up , a few details of your story . My story ? Your assertion that you were with Agent Doggett when he was shot . - What is this ? - Just wait . - ls that a true statement ? - Yes . I mean , no , I wasn 't with Agent Doggett when he was shot , but I was with him at the time AD Skinner called to tell me he 'd been shot . Look , Monica ... You know how I feel . You know I 'm on your side , but give me something here . Give me some mitigating reason for what you 're trying to cover up . I 'm gonna put a stop to this . What are you saying to me , Brad ? Why are you saying these things ? We 've checked and rechecked the ballistics tests . The bullet that hit Doggett came from your gun . And furthermore , we have an eyewitness . One who has placed you at the scene . is that why I 'm here ? In this room ? So you can make an id ? Agent Reyes , I have to ask you for your fbi identification . Who 's there ? Who 's back there ? We appreciate your cooperation , sir . Anything I can do to help . Smart touch - posting a guard to make sure I don 't finish the job . Do you really believe I did this ? No , but it doesn 't matter what I believe . You may still be arrested . - So what are they waiting for ? - Follmer 's case has potential holes . For starters , when I called you , you were at home , 14 miles from the crime scene . - Plus , the condition of your gun . - lt hadn 't been fired . However , the bullet does match your gun . Perfectly . It doesn 't make any sense . None of it . What about the eyewitness ? What can you tell me about him ? You know we can 't discuss that . Look . Oh , my God , John . - ls he conscious ? - l don 't know . It could just be a muscle spasm. lt 's not uncommon with this type of spinal injury . That 's not a spasm . - What is it ? - lt 's Morse code . What did he say ? Lukesh . What ? What does that mean ? Who 's there ? is somebody there ? Irwin , is that you ? - Who else would it be , Mama ? - l thought maybe robbers . I thought something terrible had happened to you . You were gone so long . I was gone two hours and six minutes . I 'm back at noon , just like I told you . I was so scared . Could you bring me a glass of Clamato with two squirts of Texas Pete and two ice cubes ? God , I was all alone . And I heard the knob rattle . Somebody was rattling the knob . It was the robbers , I just know it was . I don 't know how I got through it . I was so scared . Like sands through the hourglass , so are the days of our lives . My show is on . Could you make my hot sandwich , so I can eat my sandwich while I watch my show ? What kind of sandwich is it ? Potted meat . I don 't think I like that . Have I had it before ? Many times . You love it . - l should be at the hospital . - Scully will call if he regains consciousness . - Either way , I should be there . - You 're under investigation . Not to mention I will be too if it 's ever found out that I showed you this . Irwin Timothy Lukesh ? Have you ever seen him before ? " 1995 , patient at the State Psychiatric Hospital at Gaithersburg . " " Diagnosed with a delusional disorder which presented itself after his father 's suicide . " After four months , he was deemed fit for release . He lives with his invalid mother in an apartment adjacent to the crime scene . - What 's the story he 's telling ? - That he heard a bang , went downstairs to investigate , and then he saw you exit the alley . This is the one person we know was in the vicinity of the shooting . Why would Doggett say his name ? You think Lukesh shot Doggett ? What if Doggett was investigating Lukesh ? What if Lukesh is somehow behind all this ? Skinner . Do you recall our discussion where l asked you to keep me up to date ? I do . Really ? It 's like we never even had it . I 'm at Washington Memorial . I 'm assuming you 're with our prime suspect . Bring her . She 's gonna talk to Agent Doggett . The gang 's all here . - How is he ? - Fully conscious . We set up a communication device designed for spinal-injury victims . Speaking with him should be easier . You 'll ask only the questions I want asked . You 're not to try to shade his testimony . If you 're so concerned , why let Reyes talk to him ? Because he says he won 't talk to anyone but you . He didn 't mention you two . John . Hey , there . That 's right . You 're alive . As if there were ever any doubt . Why am I alive ? is that what you 're asking ? I 'm fine , John . Why wouldn 't I be ? Have him say who shot him . My throat wasn 't cut , John . What do you mean ? Wiggle your finger if you feel anything . Any sensation at all . Pain , tingling . OK . That 's enough for today . We 'll see if you can do any better tomorrow . You kiss your mother with that mouth ? It 's coming along . It 's nowhere , basically . There 's so much that 's impossible to reconcile . You say I was on a stakeout with you. I say you were at my apartment bringing me ... John ... do you know a little stand on M Street ? Supposed to be really good hot dogs ? John , what if we were both right ? What if you were at my apartment and I was on a stakeout with you at the same time ? What would it take for that to be true ? Except maybe we do . Maybe all of us do . You 've heard of the idea of a parallel universe . One that 's identical , or nearly identical , to our own . One in which we all have a double . It 's theoretical physics , but what if it 's real ? You said yourself Irwin Lukesh was known for his impossible escapes . You said that in the alley you looked away only for an instant and he was gone . Back here . And then somehow he was behind you and he shot you . With my gun - my gun that never left my possession that entire afternoon . What if Lukesh can pass freely from one parallel world to the other ? Like he 's opening a door . And what if somehow you followed him through that door without even knowing it ? Maybe when you followed Lukesh into this world , my ... my Doggett got forced out . My Doggett would 've called that crazy too . But give me another theory that fits . I 'm kinda confused as to why I 'm back . I already told you everything I know . We just had a few little inconsistencies that we needed to clear up . Sure . Dot the i 's , cross the t 's . Here 's an odd one for starters . We have an eyewitness that says you shot Agent John Doggett . That 's surprising . I can 't imagine who would have said that . Agent Doggett . He 's regained consciousness . He 's very chatty . Among other things , he says that you 're a murderer . That you enjoy killing women with a straight razor . And cutting out their tongues . Yeah . Wow . What a corker . Mr Lukesh , would you consent to a GSR test ? GSR ? What is that ? To reveal whether or not someone recently fired a gun . You wouldn 't mind indulging us , would you ? I don 't know. I think I 'd have to talk to my lawyer about that . Look , my heart goes out to your Agent Doggett . But he 's confused . It 's clear to me that your female agent Ms Reyes is responsible for this tragedy . is there someone who can corroborate your story ? No . What about your mother ? You live with your mother ? She was sleeping . She wouldn 't have heard anything . Maybe she can tell us something . Would she be willing to come down here ? My mother is in poor health . She gets confused easily . We can go to her . I won 't have you harassing herjust because you won 't admit one of your people did this . Now , if you 're going to arrest me , do it . Otherwise I 'm going home . Say hi to Mama . Agent Reyes , right ? What 's the matter ? Cat got your tongue ? How do you do it ? You know what I 'm talking about , don 't you ? There 's this world , and there 's the world where you live out your sick fantasies . When did it start ? Was it after your breakdown in ' 95 ? All that anger. lt was buttoned up so tight it had nowhere else to go . It had to get released . Not here , but in a world just like this one . God , I enjoyed you . You bled just like a pig . Reyes ? You all right ? Mama , I 'm home . Mama , you want your Clamato ? Mama ? Have you been out of bed ? Mama ? You don 't tell me things , Irwin . I tell you things . You sneak out of the house all night . You leave me alone all by myself , and then you think that I don 't know ? I know. I know every time . What is it that you do , Irwin , that you don 't tell me ? I don 't do that . I don 't know what you mean . Why is that in my house ? I opened the drawer and it gave me a heart attack . I don 't even know how I even picked it up without it going off and killing me . I was so scared . Mama , I don 't know how it got there . If you won 't tell me , you can tell the fbi . That 's it . The fbi has left three messages . They want to talk to me . Can you imagine , Irwin ? Why would the fbi want to talk to me ? What are you doing ? Aren 't you even gonna listen ? - Are you gonna talk to them ? - Of course I am. lt 's the fbi . Mama ... Don 't turn on the waterworks . It 's not going to wash . I 'm the one who 's being lied to . Irwin ... What are you doing ? Irwin , what are you doing ? Irwin . Did not . Anyway , that 's what you get for hiring cheap help . Thinking about what ? How ? Bad joke . My theory is sound ? You don 't believe a word of it . Never in a million years would you believe . This has nothing to do with my theory . I would do anything for you . Anything but that . Reyes . - Skinner . Are you OK ? - Yes , sir , I 'm fine . I can 't say the same for Miriam Lukesh . - What happened ? - She 's dead . It 's the exact MO Doggett described . Most likely a straight razor was used . Lukesh killed his mother . - Do you have any idea where he is ? - None . But if everything I hear is true , he won 't be easy to find . I think he 'll find us . - Are you all right , Agent Reyes ? - Just a little jumpy , I guess . That 's understandable . I don 't think you 're the only one . Try and take it easy . We got you covered comin ' and goin ' . Anything happening out front ? No . You moved into a quiet neighborhood . It 's dead out there . I think I 'll check around once more . You wanna scream , don 't you ? To your friends outside . Parked in a van that might as well say " fbi " in huge letters . In red . Try and scream out to ' em . They can 't hear you . - Where 'd she go ? - Monica , do you copy ? Reyes ? Agent Reyes , do you read me ? - He 's in there . He 's gotta be . - lt 's not possible . What if it is ? You wanna stick around and find out ? You ruined everything , you bitch . You made me . - You made me do it . - Lukesh ... Shut up . Shut up . But you know what ? This time I get to bleed you slow . You all right ? Monica , you all right ? It 's OK. lt 's OK. lt 's over . Monica , forget about the plates , will ya ? What 's wrong ? Monica , what 's wrong ? I 'm good . Good .

 Guys . I 'm gonna pass out cookies in a minute , but first ... I need you to fill out these test cards . I want you to rate the features you like best . You know , sound , weapons , game play . And then in your own words , just tell us what you think of the game . It sucked big time ! And the monster looked like a Sesame Street reject . - It was not scary . - That blows . - So lame ! - Boring . This game is supposed to be scary . That 's why we called it " EVIL-UTION " . " We 'll show you the face of evil- - Where death is the only escape . " " Be afraid " ? Do these kids look afraid ? - You guys are so canned . - What ? But who 's gonna finish the game ? Well , starting over isn 't gonna be easy , Miss Clayton . But let 's remember what this is all about- - 7.4 billion . That 's right- - $ 7.4 billion . That 's what the video game industry netted in profits last year alone . These games are like crack to kids , only legal . You know that . But do you know how to hook ' em ? How to separate them from their $ 7.4 billion ? You scare them . Yeah , Hardcore 's my real name . I had it legally changed a year ago . I wanted Diablo , but it was already taken . I plan to reapply for it when the other Diablo ... passes on . Today 's kids have seen it all . So if you want to scare them , you gotta be , like , out there . Like , crazy . Like these guys . I started at Joystick Graphics when I was 12 , but before that I was at Asari . We were responsible for " Star Rumblers . " I developed the sound effects driver ... for that game when I was eight , along with " Lunar Loons . " But I had to get out of that company on account of- - I don 't really know why . People say I 'm annoying , but when it comes to crunch time they always call . It 's like , " Bug , can you do this ? Bug , can you do that ? " They never call Bug when it 's time for , like , say a company picnic . No , they never extend an invitation for old Gordo . Gordon , which is my real name , but you can call me Bug . Everyone calls me Bug , although I really don 't know why . But I have a few theories . Back in 1985 , I set up my first bug collection . I took a magnifying glass- - Now , I know . I know these guys seem difficult . I know they seem unconventional . The thing is ... you can 't expect some ordinary , boring dweeb to program you scary . No way . They don 't know scary . These guys do . The name is Sol . As in Solomon . As in " the king that is wise " . As in " the solution to all your problems . " Why should you hire me ? Why ? That 's just dumb . That is a dumb question . Why do they call that a chair ? Why is the sky blue ? Why are you dressed like a 32-year-old when it 's obvious you 're at least 56 ? This game will kick ass , because these guys are kick-ass . They will give this game muscle , insanity , attitude . I don 't blame you for being scared of these freaks . I am . But that 's what makes them perfect for this game . So , guys , what do you think ? It 's a dump . I love dumps . Hi , everyone . - Welcome . - Who are you ? Laura Wheeler . It 's a pleasure to meet you . What game engine you responsible for ? I 'm not . I 'm just the intern . You know , I make copies and feed the fish . Clean up . Cookie ? Shit , you 're a spy . You 're here to steal our work . - I 'm the intern . - Sure you are . Who sent you ? Microsync ? Compu-Rom ? Who you work for ? These are all chocolate chip . You have any plain oatmeal ? I 'm allergic . Careful . You don 't know what she put in those . They 're cookies , not hemlock , you paranoid sociopath . Kids ? The game ? Oh , yeah , the game . Where 's it at ? It 's there , but the other programmers actually locked us out . - I tried to call , but they couldn 't - - Guys . You heard the man . Let 's work . All right . Let 's go , let 's go ! Guys , I 'm just tryin to impress the intern . Why ? We 're in . Game on . I thought we were working on a game and not a piece of shit . I thought we were working on a game and not a piece of shit . What congenital imbecile hired these quasi-coders ? This is weak . There 's no plug-in for virtu-goggles , cyber-gloves . - This is grim . - But can you make it scary ? That is why I hired you . Guys , you remember Faye Clayton , the money . Lady , scary 's what we do . - Good . You have four weeks . - What ? Four weeks ? I think I speak for everyone when I say " no fuckin ' way " . That 's not enough time to even develop the architecture ... much less the plug-ins for the 3-D sound . I thought these guys were good . Well , they are good . They already hacked into the system and- - I know you guys are bad ... but I 'm not sure you 're real bright ... so I 'm going to make this pep talk real simple . Three things you need to know . Number one : Time . We don 't have any . Production starts in one month and we don 't have a monster , much less a game . Now , that 's scary . This here isn 't ! So forget the plug-ins . Forget the sound . Fix the monster , and fix it quickly . This is ridiculous . - Do you know how long this takes ? - This isn 't gonna work like this . - We need a little more time , okay ? - Number two : trust . No telling what the competition might do . Spies are everywhere ... which is why we have security . There will be cameras recording everything you do . Each door is fully alarmed . So if you were even thinking a nasty thought- - Total lockdown . Nobody gets in or out . I don 't need this . Last I checked , the 13th amendment abolished slavery . Forget the sound ? That 's crazy . We 're programmers , not miracle workers . Number three : A task group will rate your work ... and based on the feature they like the best , there will be a bonus ... of $ 1 million . That 's right- - $ 1 million . Whoever makes the monster scary gets $ 1 million . Share it . Don 't share it . Give the little guy less . I don 't care . - I just want results . - Oh . God . You 've got four weeks to get it right , people . Four weeks to make me a monster . I 'm back . I 've got supplies . You hungry ? Fresh meat . You shouldn 't fuck with other people 's stuff , spy , especially mine . I just wanted to feed the fish . Like it ? It 's called the " soul claw " . Goes in clean ... comes out messy . Scary . Scary is as scary does . Which is why the bonus is all mine . Why do you waste time with those damn things ? 'Cause you can 't just let ' em die . Sure you can . If you wanna make it in this world , you gotta be PFD- - Programmed For Damage . I got you some mouthwash ... and deodorant . Please use them . God ! What is with you guys ? Can 't you enter rooms like normal people ? - I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . I 'm sorry . It 's my fault . Laura , actually , I was gonna ask you a question . - And if you say no , I can- - - Hang on a second . I got you something . Acne Buster . Extra-extra-strength . What 'd you wanna ask me ? Stupid . Stupid ! Are you in here ? Your childish antics ... will not slow me down , Bug , you pimple-dicked runt ! It wasn 't me ! A ' 78 Chateau Neuf . Did Hardcore put you up to this ? Can 't I just bring you something every once in awhile ? Don 't ever play me , intern . I need your technical expertise . Of course- - you do . Impressive . Most impressive . - Did you steal this from Daddy 's cellar ? - Something like that . Anyway , if I wanna deliver nine gigs across a T-3 line ... what 's the best way to compress and encrypt the data ? Big question for an intern . Well. hopefully I won 't be an intern forever . - What is that ? - I ran a search on the word " monster " . There 's a lot of heinous shit out there ... and all of it 's going on my million-dollar AI engine . The test kids aren 't gonna use words like " AI engine " . But they will use words like " challenging " , " exciting " , " kick-ass " . They 're gonna know this ain 't no Crackerjack game ... you can just memorize a bunch of keystrokes to win . This game is gonna help you think . It 's gonna learn as you play . No game will ever be the same . No game will ever be dull . And your AI engine is gonna give EVIL-UTION a brain ? No , better . It 'll give the game personality . See , a game is only as good as its programming ... Which is a direct reflection of its programmer . It 's a whole zen-flow , marriage-of-the-soul kind of thing . And if you input all of this into my objet d 'art , it 's- - You 'll get one psycho monster . One brilliant psycho monster . That 's it . Give me skin on that. baby . What ? You think those meat puppets are doing better work ? You think I should be concerned with Bug 's lame-ass musical sec-re ? Well , Hardcore does have some pretty intense stuff . He does ? Really ? Intense ? That 's funny . I don 't see a thing . Goddamn it ! Fuckin ' machines ! That 's kind of unfair , don 't you think ? Well , you have to be mean ... to make the green . Fa ye , please . The bonus is not helping , it 's hurting . These guys are overloading the system trying to outdo each other . Yeah , Faye , I know it 's your money ... but we can 't afford another overload . I can 't - I am being professional ! Listen , these guys are pushing everything to the max . If we don 't get some more hardware , the whole system is gonna- - Hello ? Hello ? Goddamn it ! Sol , we crashed again . You figured that out , huh ? Impressive . Just fix it , will you ? Back up the game ... reset the phones , and do something about these overloads . Yes , sir . I 'll gut right on it . Laura , what are you doing ? Well , I 've been working on this idea that I have . And actually , I was hoping that maybe after EVIL-UTION was finished- - What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry . I 'll get out of your way . That 's not what I meant . Look . Young attractive girls like you ... do not hang out with grubby , desperate geeks like us . Not by choice . I 'm serious . Now , you should be out there living it up ... looking for your Mr. Big . You know , a friend of mine tried that . She found her Mr. Big , or so she thought ... until his trust fund ran out . Still , she 's gotta be having more fun than this . I 'm sure it was a blast for a while ... until Mr. Big suddenly became this asshole stalker ... and graduated to Mr. Get-Your-Hands-Off-Me . So ... I think I 'll take my chances with the geeks . Well , the geeks are flattered . So , what 's your idea ? - Now ? - Yeah . Really ? Okay . - I 'm gonna fucking kill you ! - Bring it on ! I 'll kill you , you little twerp ! Not again . You pussy You fight like a lesbian biker bitch ! That 's funny . You look like one . Goddamn it , guys ! What the fuck is going on ? We don 't have time for this . You told me to fix the overload problem , right ? Well , here it is . This pig rewired everything so he could gorge the mainframe with his crap . Hey , this crap can filet your know-it-all little ass . Maybe , but it won 't get you any closer to my bonus ! - That 'll be the day ! - Get out of my face ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop trying to kill each other , and start working on the game . - I am working on the game . - No , you 're not . You 're working on that bonus . I mean , Jesus ! You guys are stupid . Do you know that ? You think all this is worth a million dollars ? Well , it isn 't . It 's worth more . A lot more , and Faye knows that . Only it 's not gonna be worth shit if we don 't finish . Now , I know you guys don 't like each other very much . Hell , I don 't like you . But if this game does well , we all do well . There 'll be bonuses for everybody ... and then we will never have to see each other again . But first , we have to finish the game ! So please , don 't overload the system and don 't fight . - Okay ? - You got it , boss . Why don 't they just share the bonus ? You 'll learn , intern . You 'll learn . I 'm a really big fan , Julie- - Miss Strain . Your work in Heavy Metal 2000 to El Chupacabra ... the way that you handle a- - A sword is just a perfect blend ... of brawn and beauty that we need for our game heroine . My agent said this was an acting gig ... and I only drive in the rain for acting gigs . This is . In fact , these games require a lot of acting . But in our line of business , we call it a " motion capture . " So , where 's the camera ? Actually. we 'll be using an Apex 1600 telemetry suit . It 's real next-generation type stuff . It 's got shape memory alloys and everything . A group of electronic impulse sensors linked with a computer digital model ... records your every muscle movements- - So , where 's the crew ? Get off . Here 's your wardrobe , honey . - You 're kidding , right ? - You 're right . We don 't need these . My agent said no nudity . Miss Julie , we need to scan you . And in order to get the best digital transfer ... it 's essential to keep all analog interference to a minimum . Which means no jewelry , no shoes and no clothes . Hey , we just wanna get all of you in the computer , honey . You boys want to see the big guns , we renegotiate . I want options . Don 't play dumb with me . I know these games are big business , so I want in on the IPO ... I want preferred stock , and none of this crap that you dump on the pension funds . And I want it in writing . - Not a problem . - It 's all good . Great . Who 's scanning me ? Okay , honey , strip . Untie me , damn it ! Untie me ! This is unfair ! This is so unfair ! You guys suck ! I brought her in . I should at least get to play with her too . Shut up , Bug . Oh , fine . Yeah , fine . I see how it is . You guys are just jealous because my game module 's the best . Well , go ahead . Have your little fun . Then let 's see who gets a chance at the bonus now . Give it up , little man . This game 's as scary as white rice without my Al engine . But without my weapons , what are you gonna do- - think someone to death ? Without my sound ... all you guys have are a bunch of mimes on crack . Shut up , Bug . So , where 's my mark ? Anywhere you 'd like . The remotes in the suit are fully charged . Hey , is this thing safe ? - Absolutely . - A hundred percent . All right. then , what do you want me to do ? - Jump . - What ? Jump . You know , up and down , sol can calibrate the system . Okay , my turn . Come on . What 's going on here ? - What now ? - No problems . It 's all under control . What you doin ' later , honey ? Because you 've got a nice- - I said hands off , creep ! - That 's it . I 'm out of here . - No , don 't go . Shit . I think we lost everything . It serves you right for tying me up . Now , we have to do her all over again . Yeah . Do her again . Guys , give me a status report . - I 'm down , Captain . My hands are tied . - Mine too . - Sol . - I 'm working on it . - Well , what ? wrong with it ? - Looks like the power surge ... fried out most of the IC chips on the motherboard . In English . We 're down . Total system overload . Shit ! I 'm on my way . Anything I can do to help ? Yeah . Pray . I told that idiot not to overload . Listen. can I just remind you we 're days away from test group ? If we have to start over , we 're fucked . Thanks . That 's just the Kind of Kick I need to motivate my black lazy ass . So what are we supposed to do if the system 's down ? - I don 't know . - You could help me clean . - Maybe we can get out of here . - Yeah . This place is starting to smell . Well , the good news is , the mainframes fine . - Well , thank God . - But the code 's corrupted . - We lost everything . - Goddamn it ! But I finished the backup . All our work is right here . - How long to load it all in ? - Well , we got a lot of stuff here . - Probably gonna take all night . - That sounds like a one-man job to me . Yeah . Sol can handle it . Like hell . I 'm no data-entry clown . Come on . I 'll do it . You guys get out of here . - Just tell me what I need to do . - Well , it 's simple . All you have to do is defrag the hard drives ... and run a batch relink on the media files . That was in English . You know , for someone who 's on his third software company ... your technical skills are sorely lacking . Remind us again why you 're the boss . You 're supposed to be Mr. King Business . What are you doing in this dump ? - Yeah , why are you the boss ? - Because I get you guys the big scores . Oh , yeah . And that 's what happened with the Wild Tangent gig ? - And the Compu-Rom debacle . - And now this- - the big score . You guys think you could do better on your own ? You 're welcome to try . Charming personalities like yourselves ... should have no problem getting work at the Burger Palace . All right , then . Who stays ? I 'm okay . How about Laura ? I could stay behind and help her get started . - Yeah , give it to the intern . - Leave her alone . - Don 't you think she 's done enough ? - She 's the intern . Okay . We 'll draw straws . Yeah , that 's easy for the tech retard to say . I mean , you 're useless . You don 't have to draw . Yeah , draw straws . How pre-military industrial complex . You guys have a better idea ? Hey , guys . What 's goin ' on ? Okay , game 's not fully finished ... textures aren 't rendered , and this is still a rough draft . But tournament mode does work ... so the first person to lose all their lives stays the night- - no excuses . Oh , yeah . You boys are ripe for the pickin ' . Game on ! - Here come the pain . - Which one moves backwards ? EVIL-UTION . In the great eruption of Mt . Edo ... a break in the earth opened the gate way to hell For thousands of years , we have held back the demons below . Now , the forces of evil have a powerful new overlord . He has overrun our defenses . You are the last hope . You must destroy the overlord . Stop the EVIL-UTION . Kill or be killed ! - All right , here we go . - Here we go , boys . Let 's do this . Yes ! Come on , man ! You suck , you guys . I 'm on top of this . I 'm dominating the world . Time out . Defective controller . Come on , baby . Let 's- - Come on . Come on . Motherfucker ! Which one of you crackers disconnected me ? Come on , now ! I demand satisfaction . - It wasn 't me . - It was Bug . I just said it wasn 't me . - You did this ! - I didn 't do it ! Give me mine back ! Give me back mine ! Oh , come on . This sucks ! Shit ! I 'm out . I taught it that . - Get ready to be taught . - Come on , guys . No fighting . This is not about fighting . This is a killing . Go , Laura . Girl got game . Ms. Pac-Man champion three years in a row . We 're a long way from Pac-Man , little girl . Ten bucks says Miss Pac Man kicks your ass . Shit , Drummond . Ten bucks ? Why don 't you make it hurt ? Actually , I got 50 on the intern . I got two hundred and twenty-six . - No way you win . No way . - Come on , Laura . Come on , Laura . Kick his ass ! You know why Pac Man was so popular ? It was a whole metaphor for the ' 80s . It 's like all the power and greed . You know , gobble up as much as you can as fast as you can . Hostile takeovers , leverage buyouts . Oh , look . - There 's a power pellet . - Shut up , Bug ! Not fair ! I couldn 't nuke ' em . The fuckin ' sword blasters don 't work . Yeah , they don 't . That 's just too bad . Loser . - Beginner 's luck , intern . That 's all . - Shut up , shut up . She 's still in it . You need some more life points . Grab some of that armor . Oh , my God . That is scary . Not bad , guys . Still a lot of work to do . Not bad . Sol , you make those fixes to the game tonight ? Got ' em right here . - With or without the Al chip ? - With . - And you 'll back up the changes ? - Yes , of course . What ? - You need anything ? - Yeah . - A night away from you losers . - You got it . I 'm goin ' out and gettin ' piss-drunk . Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'm gonna get me a girl and two tubs of Cool Whip . - Cool Whip ? - I 'm lactose intolerant . Don 't worry , guys . I 'll be back . " The computer . It 's more than just a box of wires . It 's an extension of our own humanity ... only a thousand times more powerful . If you believe that the computer can expand our abilities ... then why not expand upon our instinct to care- - our capacity to give ? If we did that , we could make every day like Christmas . " My God . You hate it . No , no . It 's- - The thing is , no one really cares about giving . People are far more interested in taking . - That 's a pretty dim view of things . - Is it ? Think about it . " Rook takes pawn . " " I 'll take Park Place . " " Winner takes all . " Every game in the world is judged by who can take the most . - This isn 't a game . - Everything 's a game , Laura . You 're either a winner or you 're a big fat loser . So this job is what ? Like , just a giant game of Twister ? Yeah , right foot , green , EVIL-UTION takes off . Left hand , yellow , Faye sets us up with first-run financing ... a place of our own , business cards , the works . We win if we deliver . If we don 't , we spin a left foot . Red . The game is gonna be great , Peter . I mean , home run . - And it couldn 't happen to a nicer guy . - Don 't say that . Nice is not a luxury you can afford in this business . Winners aren 't nice . You do not get your name on the building by being nice . Who are you kidding ? " Nice is not a luxury you can afford . " - Peter , you are a great guy . - How do you know ? Maybe I 'm not . Maybe I 'm a real pig fucker . Yeah , right . You gotta toughen up , Laura . Life doesn 't give you enough time to be nice- - only efficient . If you keep putting your trust in things like " good " and " mercy " ... you 're gonna lose every single time . It 's not much c-fa choice then. is it ? I mean , you either become this monster ... or be a victim . You 'll learn , intern . You 'll learn . All right , it 's magic time . Come on ! All right , all right , all right . That 's my million-dollar baby . Oh , dang . Come on , come on . Come on , now . Don 't get uppity with me . All right . Let 's work . Game 's finishing itself . But that 's impossible , unless- - Oh , yeah . My Al chip . Nothing artificial about your intelligence. baby . Nothing at all . Let 's see what else you finished for me . Let 's do this . Yeah , baby . Hello ? Motherfucker ! Burn , baby , burn . Hello ? I have got to get me some " me " time . Where you at , bitch ? Impressive . Most- - Sol , what 's with the mess you left downstairs , man ? Bug , don 't freak out . Goddamn it , Bug ! What the hell 's going on here ? - What happened to Sol ? - He 's dead , Bug . - Sol is dead . - But how ? I don 't know . He was like that when I came in . Who would 've done this ? I mean , why ? And the back-up disc is missing . Who do you think did this- - Microsync , Compu-Rom ? Does it matter ? Pick one . Fuck ! Fuck ! We have to call the police . Wait a minute . Hold on . Let 's just think about this . Think about what ? You call the police , they 're gonna lock this place up . Whoever stole that back-up disc can beat us to the market with a copycat game . Yeah , but Sol is dead . And ? And he 's- - Well , he- - You can 't- - He 's fucking dead . Hardcore ! Jesus ! Of course . Come on , Bug . Are you happy with your shitty little life ? Don 't tell me you dress like that because you choose to . Shut up . You just don 't want the police to take you back to your little cage . No , that 's not it , man . Let 's face it . The market 's getting tougher . The big scores are all but gone . - This game 's our last chance . - What- - to see what prison 's like ? Oh , please . You already know . What did you do with your big night off ? Go out with a couple of friends ? - Meet your future ex-wife ? - It 's none of your goddamn business . You did nothing , Bug . You went home and fell asleep watching TV . Shit , we might as well have stayed here at work , right ? Failures the worst prison there is . You eat alone , you sleep alone . No one gives two shits about you . No one . Not even the interns . But it doesn 't have to be like that - not anymore . We can finish the game , get EVIL-UTION out first and cash in . But how do you explain that ? He couldn 't take the pressure and bailed out . Whatever . All we need is a couple more days . The backup disc is still missing . The game 's still playing on the mainframe . All I have to do is add my sound module . That 's one less person eligible for the bonus . - What 's wrong ? - How do I know you didn 't kill him ? The same reason I know you didn 't kill him . I 'm gonna check the security cameras . Hey , Laura , wait ! Can 't have the intern beat me to the office . I overslept . Thank you for dinner last night . Next time , I 'll bring forks . Good morning . How you doin ' , bug ? - What 's going on ? - I 'm good . Everything 's good . Everything 's really good . Are we back in business ? Good . Get in there . Goddamn it , Sol ! Good morning , Hardcore . Where 's Sol ? Beats me . I think he took off . His car 's still here . Hey , wow ! Brownies ! Thanks , Laura . Hey . What 's wrong with him ? Nosy little bitch . Oh , God ! Ah , shit ! - What 's up , boss ? - Have you seen Sol ? - I need the backup disc . - Hey , don 't worry about it . I 'll take care of it for you . But stay away from the mainframe . Last thing I need ... is some Ivy League know-nothing fucking with my shit . Fine , just get it done . Yeah , get out of here . Some boyfriend . No . Shit . Goddamn it ! God , Bug ! What are you doing ? I 'm finishing up the monster 's voice . In the bathroom ? The acoustics are better in here . Ready to die ? Sure , Bug . Whatever . Laura , why- - What 's wrong ? I just need to make a phone call . Do you know how to reset the phones ? Did you try Drummond 's cellular phone ? Not yet . I will . Thank you . - Sure . - In a minute . Goddamn it ! Shit ! It 's gonna be one of those days . Laura , I can clean it up . I can do it . It 's fine . It 's fine , Bug . I got it . Come on . Son of a bitch . Bullshit , they 're deleted . Yes ! Gotcha . Okay , let 's see who 's fuckin ' with us . What the fuck ? Son of a- - Come on , Jeremy , pick up . - Sol and Hardcore are at it again . - What ? Hardcore , did you move Sol ? Because I can 't find him- - Bug , listen . There 's something freaky goin ' on here , man . I knew it . I knew you killed Sol ! I knew you killed Sol ! It was the telemetry suit . The suit did it ! Just check the security camera . - Don 't take another step closer . - Bug , shut up and listen ! I know it sounds crazy , but the suit 's alive , man . It killed Sol , and it tried to kill me . - Please don 't come any closer ! - Bug , shut up and listen ! I 'm tellin ' ya , I didn 't touch Sol . It was the suit . - Shit ! Where is it ? - Help ! Somebody , help ! - What is it ? - He killed Sol ! - Where is it ? - Guys , what- - - He killed Sol ! Look ! - Sol 's dead ? It wasn 't me . It was the suit . It was the goddamn suit . Okay , okay . Listen , big guy- - Leave . Everybody out . Okay , Hardcore , let 's talk about this . Okay ? All right ? Come on , man . Leave now ! Okay . All right . I 'm leaving . Come on . Where are you ? Shit ! You want Hardcore ? Come and get some ! Let 's get it on ! I knew something was up when Hardcore didn 't want me- - Sol 's dead , and you knew ? We have to call the police . Give me the cell phone . I 'll 9-1-1 his ass right now . Call him . Oh , shit ! Help me ! Help me , please ! - Oh , shit ! - Open up ! Oh , Jesus ! Oh , shit ! Oh , shit ! Oh , God ! Lines are all dead . This is not good . - What the hell 's goin ' on ? - I don 't know . But best guess ? Yes ! As near as I can tell , it happened yesterday with the power surge . The storm must 've nailed a transformer , causing a surge of such magnitude ... that it overloaded the entire system . Which normally isn 't that bad , but with Hardcore rewiring the system ... and God only knows what Sol was doing with the AI chip ... the combination must have had a devastating effect on the mainframe ... causing a complete in verse of code . That 's just a guess . You know how the telemetry suit works ? The suit moves , the computer records it . The suit is linked to a digital model in the computer . Whoever controls the suit controls the model . Somehow during the surge , everything got reversed . What 's goin ' on ? You guys stop this ! So the computer 's controlling the suit ? And the computer 's playing the game . Houston , we have a problem . Wait , wait . Stop . Hardcore and Sol are dead because this thing is playing a game ? Our game . EVIL-UTION . " Kill or be killed . Where death is the only escape . " Can 't you just stop the game ? I can 't . It won 't let me into the system . Well , then can 't you shut the system down or just turn it off ? - Good idea . Let 's do it . - We can 't ! Why not ? In English , Bug . The backup disc is missing . - Bug , who cares ? - The backup disc is the only copy ... of the game that we have outside the mainframe . We shut down the mainframe , we could lose all the data , all the programming . Well , can 't we run one of our utility programs ... and recover our work ? Well , even so , you can- - You can rebuild the game , right ? I can recreate the music . And the sound effects . What about the Al engine ? - That was Sol 's . - The weapons ? Jesus Christ . Didn 't you guys ever work on anything together ? - So we lose everything ? - Well , not everything . - We 'll still have our lives . - Yeah . Our miserable , pathetic , poor lives . God , you guys . What are we doing ? This game is not worth dying for . Guys ? Guys ? Come on , Bug . Come on , Laura . Look at me . I 'm not stupid . I know what people think of me . I know what I am . What are you talking about ? They just haven 't spent time with you . You have . Tell me . Would you kiss this face ? Be honest . Maybe . " Maybe . " Well , I 'm tired of being a " maybe " . I wanna be a " yes " . I need that bonus . I need this game . You really think that money 's gonna do all that ? Yeah , I do . Laura 's right . I 'll go . I 'll shut it down . No , I 'll go . At least I still might be able to save some of the work . You go , we 'll lose everything for sure . - Just a " maybe " , huh ? - A definite " maybe " . Okay , come on ! Go , go , go ! All right . - What ? What ? - What 's taking so long ? - I 'm looking for the back-up disc - What ? If that thing killed Sol , and the back-up disc is missing ... it 's still playing the game ; it wouldn 't take the disc . But , fuck the disc ! Shut it off ! Come on , come on . Look , I 'm trying to save our livelihoods here . All right ? This is a delicate piece of machinery . You can 't just flip on a switch and walk away like some fucking light . Fine , fine , just hurry it up . All right , the RAM board is connected to- - Guys ? The 3-D board is connected to the SCSI . The SCSI is connected to the- - what ? - Hurrying . - Good , ' cause it killed the camera . What do you mean , it killed the camera ? Oh , Jesus . Oh , man , oh , man . The SCSI is connected to the what ? To the what ? To the red wire . Red wire . Red wire . Bug , are you all right ? Where is it ? Where 's the monster now ? Don 't shoot ! - Shut it off ! Kill it ! - Jesus ! Red wire . Goddamn it ! God- - Come on , you son of a- - Shit ! Come on , come on . God , give me something ! Come on ! Okay . Shit . Shit ! Shit . - You okay ? - Yeah . Is it gone ? - It didn 't work ! - No shit ! Can you kill it ? All right . What do we do now ? Get outta here ! - Come on ! Why 's the door locked ? - Security system 's fried . - Well , override it ! - I 'm trying ! Oh , come on ! Don 't tell me I 'm trapped in here ! Wait ! Where is that thing ? Laura , it 's Jeremy . I know you 're in there . I can see your car . Hello ? Jeremy , I 'm in here ! I need your help ! Please ! - In here ! We 're in here ! - Help ! Help ! Jeremy , help us , please ! We 're in here ! Come on , baby . Open the door . Are you trying to punish me ? Is that it ? Fine . Be that way You know , I don 't need this shit , Laura ! Why don 't you go fuck yourself ? Why don 't you go fuck the freaks while you 're in there ? I know that 's what you fuckin ' want to do , right ? Fuck ! Laura , you better fucking hide in there , you fucking bitch ! You fucking whore ! You fucking slut ! Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuckin ' stay in there and die , bitch ! Fuck this . Laura , it 's okay . It 's me . - Okay . That hurts . - Oh , my God . Here . Jesus , Laura . - It 's nothing . - Sorry . Thanks . Come on . We 're gonna use the air ducts to get outta here . - What are you looking for ? - A way out . See , we didn 't have time to build the game levels from scratch . So you used the building layout . Okay , if we just follow the air ducts- - What 's that over there ? Right above the fire engine under Edo 's point . That 's it . That 's how we get outta here . Roof vent . Oh , please . Oh , come on . This ... isn 't ... happening . I don 't wanna die ! Fresh meat . Damn , that was scary . Damn , I 'm good . Programmed for damage . Yes , you are . - Scary is as scary does . - That was always my favorite . Shut up , Bug . - What ? - Careful . Spread out . These panels can 't hold both of us . Do you think we 're gonna make it ? Sure . Left foot , red . Just a tough spin , but we 'll finish the game , right ? That 's not what I meant . Bug , where are you ? Somebody help m- - Ready to die ? Maybe . Definite maybe . - What was that ? - I don 't know . - Get back ! Get back ! - Oh , my God ! God , what was that ? Hold on . We 're coming . - Oh , my God . - Laura , careful . Shit . I 'll check the front door . Come on , damn it ! Open ! - Hardcore 's Palm Pilot . - What ? Hard-cores Palm Pilot has wireless access . It 's gotta be here somewhere . Okay , you e-mail for help . I 'm gonna get this door open . Gross . I got it ! No , I don 't . It 's controlled by the digital model , and the model is playing the game . - So , how do we get outta here ? - We beat the game . - Okay , I 'm in . - This gonna work ? Yeah , if I can kill the monster . - Think you can win ? - Gonna try . - This isn 't Ms. Pac-Man . - Yeah , I know . Kill or be killed Damn . - Game over . - Goddamn it ! - What is it ? What 's wrong ? - It 's learned all my moves . - It 's getting smarter . - It can 't do that . It 's just a game . It 's not . It 's everything . It 's Hardcore 's intensity and Sol 's attitude , even Bug- - it 's all in there : all the fighting , all the greed . All that shit is in there , and it 's gonna get us killed ! Good . I was wondering when you 'd learn . Here . Try it with these . Ripe for the picking - What ? What is it ? What 's wrong ? - It 's here . Where ? I could swear it was here . It 's only me . Laura , I promise you , if that thing gets near to you at all ... it 's gonna have to kill me first . Where 'd it go ? Game on . Shit . Oh , shit . Come on , where is it ? Where is it ? Come on , come on , come on ! Shit . God , where is it ? Yes ! No shit ! Shit . The back-up disc was never missing . You took it . You 're the spy . You were gonna sell us out from the start . Laura , thank God you 're all right . Where is it ? How could you ? Laura , put the gun down . Trust me . I 'm- - Don 't say that . My boyfriend- - My ex-boyfriend used to say that . Tell me why . Why ? What answer do you want to hear , Laura- - greed ? That 's too simple ... even though Compu-Rom is paying me a lot of money for this . Ambition ? No , selling out your own company never looks good . Mom needs an operation . Wouldn 't that be nice if it were true ? See , I wish I could boil it down to one convenient answer for you , intern ... but the thing is , if you have to ask ... then you really haven 't learned a damn thing , have you ? So don 't ask me why . Ask yourself : Why not ? But what about your deal with Faye- - The business cards , your name on the building ? Who cares ? That Kind of thing may impress your folks. but out in the real world ... money is the only way they keep score , darling . Even if it means killing Hardcore and Sol and Bug ? Hold on . I didn 't create that monster . They did . You said it yourself- - All that fighting , all that greed . Put that into a computer and , yeah , you get a real scary mess . - Just like the real world , right ? - That 's right . The real world is messy because people are messy . Now , maybe you 're too naive to believe that ... or maybe- - you 're just too stupid to learn . Either way , that fact separates us into the haves and the have-hots . It makes me a decision maker and you a doormat . It makes me a winner , and you a lo- - You fucking bitch . Oh , that 's good , intern . That 's really good . You 're finally learning . It 's over for you . Over ? Oh , please . I 'll tell the jury it was the pressure . It was my childhood ! It was the game ! Because no one wants to believe ... that we 're capable of such darkness all on our own ... that deep down inside we 're all monsters . So it 's not over . Not yet . That 's not what I meant . Oh , shit . Hey , pigfucker ! Game on . Come get some . You 'll learn , intern . You 'll learn . - Yes ! I rule ! - I beat it ! I told you I could beat you ! I beat you ! I think we have a winner . I don 't approve of the mess left behind , but I can 't argue with the results . - Good job , Laura . - And ? And thank you ? Three things . One : the bonus . The million-dollar bonus , I believe . But you 're an intern . Yeah , but you are happy with the game . Pity nobody could back up your story that Drummond committed the murders . Compu-Rom claims that they 've never heard of him . And there 's no security footage . Seems odd , don 't you think ? Two : Microsync releases EVIL-NATOR this fall . I know the name sucks , but it is remarkably similar to EVIL-UTION- - AI engine , scary monster . Practically identical , I hear . Be a shame if they were to beat us to market . Not a chance . They 're months behind us . How could they Po - Three : It 's like you said- - you never know what the competition might do . Spies are everywhere . Miss Wheeler , the new intern 's here . - Fine . Send her in . - Okay . It 's not scary , it 's shit . Yes , I 'm looking at it right now , and it 's not scary . You know , I don 't want to hear this . I just want you to fucking fix it . I really appreciate you taking the time to do this , Miss Wheeler . Opportunities like this are rare . - Even more so- - - Do you have a question ? Okay . Sure . What 's the most valuable lesson you 've learned in your career ? Stupid question . Next ? What 's the most important asset for a woman to have ... - in her line of work ? - Next . Fine . What 's the secret of your success ? You 're kidding me , right ? Look , Miss Wheeler , I am trying to be nice here . Don 't . What ? Don 't be nice . But why ? Because the world is not nice . It is complicated and it is messy . It is overflowing with arrogance and greed and uncertainty . It 's a lot of heinous shit . It 's a world where bad wins out every single time . Now , maybe you 're too naive to believe that ... or too stupid to learn it . But if you believe in the good and mercy of others ... you will always lose . You will always be the victim . And then you 'll learn , intern . You 'll learn .

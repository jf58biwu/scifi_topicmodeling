 Last time on " Star Trek : Voyager " . Two more of the mutations have been discovered . Have their cortical nodes analysed . - This is only a dream . - No , I brought you here . This is Unimatrix Zero . You used to come here . Unimatrix Zero is real . So are the people who go there . They need our help . If we can 't terminate their link , then we 'll simply have to pay them a visit . They don 't have the ability to take action in the real world . We 'll give them that . Stay away from things that don 't concern you . I can 't do that . We were more than friends , weren 't we ? This is our target . Keep a transporter lock on me . Once I release the virus you can beam me back . In how many pieces ? Captain , I expected something more cunning from you . Their lifesigns are destabilising . And now the conclusion . - Lieutenant . - I 'm all right . - You have a subvocal processor . - I can live with it . - The captain ? - We were separated . I don 't know where they took her . We must proceed to the central plexus . - Time . - 17 minutes . - We should have heard something . - Doctor ? Their higher brain functions are stable . Cube 's new heading - 121 , mark 6 . Matching course and speed . Their propulsion system is regenerating . They 'll soon be capable of transwarp . I want you inside Unimatrix Zero . When the virus is released , your friends will be the first to know . Problem ? No . But I wouldn 't call them my friends . Acquaintances then . Set aside your issues with these people . Understood . Patrol the north-eastern perimeter . More drones were spotted there . Where 's that virus ? Captain Janeway is deploying it . The Borg have increased their attacks . They 're identifying us one by one . Your mate is not here . He 's not my mate . - He must not be regenerating . - Or he 's dead . He should be here . No one 's seen him . If he died in battle , I 'm sure it was honourable . Here . Help me . It 's obvious your heart is in conflict . My heart is functioning perfectly . Some advice from a warrior in the bedchamber and the battle field . You must treat your heart as the enemy so you won 't be distracted in battle . I 'll keep that in mind . - Has the virus been deployed ? - I 'm not sure . Do you remember anything ? No . Nothing . The central plexus is through here . Those must be the shield emitters Seven told us about . - We need to get through that hatch . - I 'll deactivate him . - Captain . - What 's left of her . - How are you holding up ? - Fine . I can 't access the plexus without shutting down the power grid . The primary access port is isolated from the main power grid . - Where is it ? - 30 metres from here . Tuvok . Commander . - I can hear the collective . - The neural suppressant is wearing off . I 'll be all right . I heard him . The Vulcan . But he 's gone . Why ? Why can 't I hear the others ? Leave this one to me . - Comfortable ? - Release me . Easier said than done . I think I designed this trap a little too well . - What are you doing out here ? - Looking for you . - Korok was concerned . - That doesn 't sound like Korok . - He said you were missing . - I 've been busy setting traps . Not the most sophisticated technology . Seems to work . Hold on . I should return to the camp . Wait for word on the virus . I 'll go with you ... in case you run into any more trouble . As you wish . I 'm sure Korok will be glad to see me . Tuvok . Where are you , Tuvok ? - Commander ? - Stardate 38774 . Vulcanis Lunar Colony . The time and place of my birth . Recalling such details helps me remain focused . Captain , if I succumb to the collective , I 'll pose a security risk . - You must deactivate me . - Without the Doctor , that could kill you . Stay focused . Stay Tuvok . That 's an order . Captain , I 've bypassed the access codes . Welcome to the central plexus . Tuvok . Where are you , Tuvok ? - Busy ? - What 's on your mind ? The away team . It 's been two and a half hours . The Doctor 's keeping an eye on them . We 'll give it a little more time . Not everything goes according to plan . It occurs to me that with you in command and Tuvok off the ship , that makes me acting first officer , technically speaking . - What 's your point ? - It 's my duty to give you an opinion . I think we should pull them out now before it 's too late . I appreciate your diligence . But I 've made my decision . We wait . - How long ? A day ? A week ? - As long as the mission takes . - This mission isn 't worth their lives . - You 've made your point . Apparently not . Lieutenant . A first officer could get in trouble for talking that way . I 've learned from the best . I appreciate your concerns , Tom . But I need your support on this . Aye , sir . Download the virus . Tuvok . My daughter 's name is Asil . She was born in the city of ... T 'Paal . We share your memories . You 're part of us now . Don 't resist . Commander Tuvok 's synaptic pathways are destabilising . If I decide to move in closer , I assume my first officer would concur . You assume correctly . We have to contact Voyager . You 're Commander Tuvok , tactical officer of the starship Voyager . I 'm your captain . Step aside . She 's irrelevant . Captain , you must deactivate me . My designation is Three of Twelve . Where are you , Tuvok ? The central plexus . - Range 40,000 km . - Harry ? - Too much shielding . I can 't get a lock . - Stay on it . Closer . This way . Back so soon ? Target their shield generators . Stand by phasers . Commander ? Shields to full . Brace for impact . Someone 's accessing our controls . - Shields down ! - Evasive manoeuvres . - I 've lost the away team . - Hull breaches . Decks 5 , 6 , 7 . - Reverse course . - We can 't just leave them . The Borg have our access codes . Get us out of here . Thank you , Tuvok . I 'm losing voices . Five in spatial grid 96 . Twelve in grid 182 . Hundreds now . Thousands . I can 't hear you . Why can 't I hear you ? You 've disconnected from the hive mind . Explain . Comply . No ! I 'm not alone . You can 't stop us all . I altered the transmission to restore your original appearance . - I know how vain humans are . - Why am I here ? You 've caused a great deal of suffering . I wanted you to see for yourself . You are the cause of his death , Captain . You disconnected him from the hive mind . - You didn 't have to kill him . - He was confused . Irrational . I had no choice . Many more will die unless you tell me how to counteract the virus . Sorry , we didn 't think to develop an antidote . I 'll assimilate Voyager then . Your Doctor created the pathogen . He can find a cure . My first officer will delete the Doctor 's program if you go near Voyager . It won 't be long before thousands of drones begin to fight back . - They will fail . - Maybe . Probably . But a lot of damage will be done before they do . Yes . A lot of damage . Spatial grid 94 . Cube 630 . Complement - 64,000 drones . But I can no longer hear three of them . No doubt they 've joined your resistance . Are they trying to sabotage the vessel and liberate others ? I don 't know because I can no longer hear them . Initiate self-destruct . An effective solution , don 't you agree ? Spatial grid 091 . Sphere 878 . Complement - 11,000 drones . Only one is silent . But I have no choice . I must silence all of them . I know how this must upset you . As a Starfleet officer , you value all life . Even drones . How many more are you willing to sacrifice ? Thousands ? Millions ? You can put an end to this . I want you to go on a diplomatic mission . It 's one of your primary functions , isn 't it ? Negotiations ? Go on . Tell them to rejoin the collective and I 'll stop . They will never agree to that . They 're individuals now . They have a choice . What are you afraid of , Captain ? That they may cooperate ? You 've been waiting for a chance to damage the Borg . You 've found one . You 're only using them . 'lf you really wanted to negotiate , you 'd visit Unimatrix Zero . You 've sent drones . Surely you could go yourself . Or will a taste of individuality make you realise it 's worth fighting for ? Comply , or you will be responsible for many more deaths . You 'll have to destroy the entire collective to find them all . Several drones have retained their memories of Unimatrix Zero . - The virus has been deployed . - Good . We need help . - The away team is still on that cube . - And we can 't mount a rescue . Can you find out if they have anyone else aboard this cube ? If they do , tell them to hurry . They 're our only allies . I 'd like to make adjustments to your alcove before you return . When this crisis ends , I 'll find a more permanent solution , so you can spend more time in Unimatrix Zero . You 're in a unique position . Not many of us get to lead a double life . When this crisis ends I will sever my link to Unimatrix Zero . May I ask why ? I 'm having difficulties with one of the people there . Mr Axum ? Whenever you mention his name , your pupils dilate . Blood flow increases to your face . Both are consistent with an emotional response . Axum and I apparently had a relationship . Oh , romantic ? There go those pupils again . Your diagnosis is accurate . Well how ironic . All this time we 've been trying to develop that aspect of your humanity , and it 's been there all along . - Not any more . - My readings say otherwise . You 're very particular about who you spend time with . No doubt that 's why you and I have become friends . If you were involved with Axum once , doesn 't that suggest he 's worthwhile ? He does possess commendable qualities . Coming from you , that 's high praise . There 's nothing wrong with feeling ambivalent . After all , you 're in the middle of a civil war . But eventually , you may want to give this romance a second chance . Who knows ? You may even get to meet him in person some day . I 'll say this for your Mr Axum . He 's a very lucky man . The collective has found a new way to attack us . Eleven ships have self-destructed in three hours . We need to coordinate a way to strike at the heart of the collective . Our target should be the Unicomplex . If we can disrupt the queen 's control , it 'll give us a chance to build up a fighting force . There is one more objective . The Voyager away team . Their sacrifice will not be forgotten . - We can still rescue them . - She 's right . They risked their lives for us . Now it 's our turn . - There 's no time . - It 's a matter of honour . I thought you of all people would understand that . I 'll see if any of our people are on a vessel near theirs . - Thank you . - It 's the least we can do . What 's wrong ? It turns out I 'm on a scout ship patrolling the border of fluidic space . On the other side of the galaxy . I was hoping we 'd be able to meet one day in the real world . Me too . There are things I can do where I am . I 'll try to contact Species 8472 , see if I can persuade them to join the fight . Given their history with the Borg , I 'm sure they 'll be eager . I guess this rules out Vorothon Gorge . Gorge ? It was the top of our list of things to see if we were ever freed from the collective . Don 't you remember ? We could add fluidic space to our list . We still have Unimatrix Zero . It was sufficient before . And now ? - Where are you ? - Over here . Don 't be frightened . Stand up . Let me look at you . Comply . You 're one of the machine people . You 're trying to hurt us . That 's the last thing I want to do . I 'm here to help you . All of you . - They said you wanted to assim ... - Assimilate you . Yes . But that 's nothing to be afraid of . You like having friends , don 't you ? Assimilation turns us all into friends . It brings us so close together we can hear each other 's thoughts . Is that fun ? Yes . It 's fun . I was about your age when I was assimilated . I was worried then , too . But when I began to hear the others , to hear their thoughts , I wasn 't afraid any more . - Don 't you miss your parents ? - They 're here . With me . Part of us . I can hear them right now . Would you like to be with your parents ? They miss you . They want to see you . - Can I talk to them ? - Soon . But first I 'd like to see more of this . There 's a place where you can see the whole forest . Show me . It 's pretty , isn 't it ? I took your advice , Captain . I visited Unimatrix Zero . It 's far more primitive than I expected . How could anyone prefer a crude environment to Borg perfection ? Spend a little more time there . You might find out . I 've seen enough . It 's an illusion . The people who go there are real , and they won 't give it up easily . They 'll fail . I thought you 'd like to see our latest accomplishment . Recognise it ? - No . - I think you do . It 's your nanovirus , with a few modifications . We 've reprogrammed it to target your mutated drones . Once it 's released , it will erode their autonomic functions . They will die within minutes . You have no way to deliver it . Those drones have been separated from the hive mind . They aren 't linked to the central plexus . No . But there 's another way I can reach them . I 'm prepared to go back to Unimatrix Zero and release it myself . But I 'm willing to reconsider . It all depends on you . Me ? If they rejoin the collective , I 'll spare their lives . They listen to you . Tell them it 's time to come home . You were responsible for many deaths . Now you can save thousands . Decide . Let 's try this again . Ensign ? The warp core is on-line . Navigational array . Shields at 20 % . We 've got sensors . Short-range only . It 's a start . Try to get a fix on the away team . Now what ? Someone 's tapping into our holographic systems . It 's a Borg signal . - Doctor to the bridge . - Go ahead . Someone 's here to see you and Seven . Come down here right away . Kathryn ? The Borg have established this link so I can propose a compromise . We 're listening . They 've developed a nanovirus that can kill every Borg with the mutation . They 're prepared to release it inside Unimatrix Zero unless all the drones there return to the collective for reassimilation . That 's surrender . I won 't be responsible for any more deaths . At least they 'll survive as drones . Tell them Unimatrix Zero can no longer exist . That 's an order . Have I made myself clear ? Yes , Captain . - We did our best . - It 's not over yet , Doctor . Can you disrupt the interlink frequency for Unimatrix Zero ? - The captain gave us a direct order . - Not the one you think . Seven ? I believe I can . But why ? Didn 't you hear ? Unimatrix Zero can no longer exist . Chakotay to the bridge . Report . A transwarp conduit just opened off our port bow . Lieutenant ? - They 're on an intercept course . - Evasive manoeuvres . Battle stations . - They 're hailing us . - Open a channel . Starship Voyager . I am General Korok . This vessel is now under my command . We 've come to join you in battle . Your crewmates are coming to retrieve you . You were wise to comply . Chakotay to Seven . We 're almost in range . Stand by . I 've isolated the frequency . Get Korok . Our emitters are fully charged . Do you have the interlink frequency ? - We have it . - Wait for my signal . We have to end our regeneration . We can 't be here when it happens . - Will there be anything left ? - We 're being asked to make a sacrifice . But it 's the only way . - We 're in range . - Full power to the shields . All weapons on-line . Voyager to Korok . It 's time . You must go . Bridge , it 's working . Unimatrix Zero is shutting down . Acknowledged . Voyager to Korok . Now . - What are they doing ? - You wanted to destroy Unimatrix Zero . We 're just lending you a hand . - Get me the virus . - There 's no one left to infect . - Is this your compromise ? - I don 't compromise with Borg . Match their shield modulations and fire . - I 'm picking up the away team . - lsolating their bio-signatures . - Get a lock . - I can 't penetrate their inner shields . Voyager to Korok . Status . Patience . They 're trying to remodulate their shield grid . I 'm attempting to compensate . - You shouldn 't be here . - Neither should you . - I 've wasted our time together . - No , you didn 't . - You gave us a chance to fall in love . - We 've lost our way to be together . No . I 'll find you . - Axum ... - I 'll find you . Shields in subgrid 42 are destabilising . Target that section . Initiate self-destruct . - Their shields are down . - Energise . Chief medical officer 's log , stardate 54014.4 . It 's been 48 hours since the away team returned to Voyager . I 've been able to extract most of their Borg technology . The captain and B 'Elanna are on the mend . But Tuvok will need a little more time to recover . General Korok has finished his repairs . He 's been contacted by another Borg vessel . It 's also under the control of former drones . The Doctor removed my spinal clamps but I won 't play hoverball for a while . If I ever imply it 's been easy on you , remind me of this . Noted . Unimatrix Zero may be gone , but the resistance is alive and kicking . The collective may never be the same . Korok said he would try to maintain contact , keep us informed . Have you heard from your friend ? No . But I don 't expect to . Axum 's vessel is in the Beta Quadrant . If I ever imply that he was nothing more than a friend remind me about today .

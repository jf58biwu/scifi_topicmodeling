 Mad cow . Where do you find prion samples ? In 4 dead people . These chickens could be carrying a fucking death sentence for millions of people . What can we do for those who are potentially infected ? There is no cure . Where are you going ? Don 't you want me to come in with you ? Go back to your lab , Dad . - Lilith , moved in . - Wow . - What is she like , 14 ? - 15 . Tons of attitude ! Hira 's replacement . - Are you still interested in Jill Langston ? - Absolutely . What do you want me to do about David ? Maybe in Chicago when he 's there next week . Good morning . It was said of the Spanish Flu , that you felt a little ill at breakfast , went to bed after lunch , and were dead by dinner . What would you say if I told you I 've got a lead on the perfect specimen ? Bullshit . So can I take a couple of days ? I 'm playing with this guy Archambault , 32 . His heart exploded , David . Instead of injecting something into him that shouldn 't be there , he gets his body to make it . So Biriliski and Archambault died to avoid a patent infringement ? You don 't understand . You can 't do it anymore . You will die . Fuck you , David . You 're a big shot scientist . I 'm nobody . How is he ? Ah .. He 's gonna be okay . He 's a tough guy . 1x06 - The Trials And that 's about it . Good . Ah ... one more thing . Yes . I 'm sorry about last week . I shouldn 't have put you on the spot like that . No . I admire your integrity . Even more than I appreciate your keeping Dr. Sandstrom from going public on this prion thing . Let 's just hope we stop this thing soon enough . Caroline , I need a personal favor . A colleague of mine , James Bainbridge , his son Ryan was diagnosed with leukemia about six months ago . They were admitted into a trial for some new treatment . I 'm not up to speed on it , but they tell me it was incredibly promising . Was ? There is some question about it 's safety . And you 'd like NorBAC to get involved ? Senator Bainbridge and a lot of sick kids would . And .. Jim would see it as a favor . And he does sit on a Senate 's Science and Tech Committee . - Garcinia cola . - That 's a plant . Comes from the same place where ebola lived . Never heard of it . A big deal at the International Botanical Congress . Traditional African medicine . Poison antidote . And it works on Zaire Ebola ? It works on any strain from what I 've read . It 's amazing . It 's a dimeric flamanoid , and if it stops Ebola replication in its tracks ... You think it 's worth throwing at the Miranda Virus ? Why not ? You got the DNA sequences back from the dental floss yet ? Bob should have it this afternoon . Where is Bob ? - He 's waiting for us at the hoop . - Aw , you didn 't tell him . What am I suppose to say , David ? Oh Bob , you 're too good , you can 't play basketball with us ? Yes . Where are you going ? Wait . What meeting ? - Left a message on your machine . - I didn 't check it . Of course . We 've been asked to mediate in the dispute between two researchers in a clinical trial . - David ! - I don 't do bureaucratic bullshit . This bureaucratic bullshit has a US senator attached , who will help give your bank financed and give you every new toy you want . Who 's running the trial ? - Julius Booker at the University .. - Is this about the new gene therapy treatment for Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) ? You know about it ? I heard they got shutdown , what happened ? - One of his test patients died . - Well , that hurts , but people with leukemia do die . Why 'd they pull the plug ? One of his lead researchers , Lauren Folley , claims that . - Lauren Folley ? - You know her ? Let me get my coat . Hello , Robert . Miss Richmond . Why don 't you get in ? All right . Robert , why don 't you come around to the front ? All right . Robert , you 're not doing anything wrong . I feel like I am . I always have . Robert , we 've had this arrangement for over a year now . I know I know . It 's just .. I don 't know what they 'll say if they found out . Well , let 's make sure they don 't find out . And the paperwork ? Thank you , Robert . Thank you , Miss Richmond . Come in . Dr. Folick , Caroline Morrison , NorBAC . Lauren , please . - Pleased to meet you . - Nice to meet you . David . Long time . Lauren . Ahh ... We were biology undergrads together . - Back in the dark ages . - Very dark . Very dark . - So I guess we 've been invited to the party . - Yeah . I 'm glad . I feel like I 'm out there all alone . - Come in . Sit . - Thank you . So , Lauren you think this is a questionable treatment ? Not questionable . Maxwell Peterson was 11 years old . He was a wonderful , bright boy . He was diagnosed with leukemia a year ago . Do you got any proof that the therapy caused the stroke ? Well , he died just 4 hours after receiving the treatment . No , I meant scientific proof . You know hard numbers , data , that kind of thing . No . Not yet . So you just jumped to the conclusion that the kid died from the injection . Gene therapy is about injecting a virus . A good virus . It goes right into the cancer cells and kills them . - A " Magic Bullet . " - I see . I think that the Peterson boy 's system over responded . Maybe the dosage was wrong ... - Maybe it was the timing ... - But you don 't know .. Neither does Booker . You brought this up with the internal review board ? Yeah , I asked them if they could believe if this was just a coincidence . Well , did you ask them if it was just a coincidence that the other two patients got better ? Look , David . The point is Booker just wants to plow ahead . And write this stroke off as a normal occurrence in an AML patient . Well , he 's not wrong . Is this something that the chief scientist on the project should just ignore ? Why would he do that ? The university 's job is to keep money flowing into research . And Booker is a money magnet . Someone 's got to do it . Come on , David . Cancer treatment is a 20 billion dollar a year business . If Appliex is the first to market this gene therapy they are going to make a fortune . Appliex Pharmaceuticals ? Yeah . Wow . You 're butting heads with a hell of a pharmaceutical company . Yeah , well . They 've had their failures . Give me a drug medic that hasn 't . Look . I just think that we need to step back and ask ourselves some hard questions . I see . So instead of working with Booker , you just decided to go over his head and blow the whistle on him . You haven 't changed a bit . I 'd say you haven 't either . - My data . Keep an open mind . - I will . - Very nice to meet . - Nice to meet you . I wouldn 't be surprised if this is her " Best of Celine " collection . What 's the matter with you ? I hate Celine Dion . What 's wrong ? Folley . She 's so textbook . She 's got no imagination . She just gets on the tracks ... one direction . One conclusion , one answer . Had been that way since the day I met her . What ? You two had a thing , didn 't you ? - Where did that come from ? - Did you ? You know how it is in university , I mean , everybody 's sleeping with everybody else .. You were sleeping with everybody else ? No . Not everybody . Oh come one you trying to tell me you didn 't sleep around ? I don 't see that 's any of your business . - Well you 're judging me . - Yeah , just like you 're judging Lauren Folley - As a scientist . A bad scientist . - Can you be objective ? Yes . - Hey . - Have you been waiting long or what ? No really , no . So what do you want to do ? I don 't know . That . Looks like fun . Mick , skaters are losers . Didn 't know that . So uhh .. what 's the coolest thing you 've ever done ? Wow . That 's a huge question . Like anything . Like uh .. Seen , done or whatever . Doesn 't matter . I saw a corn-snake eat a mouse . Like just whole . Come on you can do better than that . - Okay , I shaved off all my hair . - Yeah . Why ? Because I was bored . I don 't know . Oh I know , a whale . A whale winked at me . What do you mean ? We went whale watching and we were on the boat and this huge whale , like totally humongous , comes up and it was this far away , I swear , it just came out of the water looked at me and I swear to you , it winked . It winked at me . Man . I want that . What ? I want a whale to wink at me . - A whale ? - Yeah . - Um .. Where are you gonna find a whale ? - The ocean . Whatever , we 'll find it . 24 trials of my career and this is the most promising treatment I 've ever worked on . - Is it the safest ? - The whole point of the trial is to find out if it 's safe , but I can 't believe Folley 's allegations . You know we 're looking at fast-track designation with the FDA on this ? Do you think Folley is way off base here ? Well , she 's jumping the gun making decisions based on emotions , not science . Wouldn 't be the first time . A child did die in the trial . The boy was sick . He died of a disease that we were trying to save him from . You see cancer cells , they multiply at an extremely high rate . We deliver a simple cold virus that makes an RNAi . RNAi , it 's a new method for eliminating proteins like AML-6 . And the RNAi kills the mutant protein in the cell , and cell growth is arrested . We 're tricking them into committing mass suicide . - Apoptosis . Wow . - Exactly . The RNAl is encoded with an EBV derived plasma under a poll 3 expression . Now the plasma is targeted to the tumor cells and a viral vector harboring a humanized anti-CD33 binding protein . Because CD33 is highly expressed in AML cells . That 's it . See it 's a triple barrel approach . We attack the specific molecular defect in an AML cell , we induce apoptosis and we can even insure higher specificity by using the CD33 binding protein . It 's amazing . Because of one death , this treatment is going nowhere ? See why I 'm so ... Pissed off ? Yeah . I like a man who 's not afriad of being a rude , pompous , arrogant , asshole . That 's why we get along so well . Caroline , what Booker is working on in there is leading edge science . Folley was one of his senior scientist . She 's over interpreting based on one observation . Okay , do me a favor . Explain to me what he was talking about in there ? - And don 't gloat . - Okay . If I had two samples of the same virus , and I put them ideal condition , right ? Turn the lights down low , put on a little Barry White - I got it . - I 'd never get a third virus , because viruses don 't reproduce that way . - Thy 're asexual . - Ah you 've been doing a little reading eh ? Go on . So in order for a virus to reproduce they 've evolved this neat little tricks of breaking into a host cell , killing the boss , taking over , " Okay , you guys are working for me now . " Pretty soon you got all these nasty little viruses out there and the neighborhood 's shot to hell . Okay . Okay , so in gene therapy , you take a virus and you alter it , right . You remove all the nasty bits and replace them with something good . And now you 've got the best delivery system mother nature has to offer . Because if you inject a few trillion of these nicely altered little viruses into a patient , the viruses will just do what comes naturally , and they will break into - the patient 's cell .. - And kind of infect them with health ? - Pretty amazing , eh ? - Yeah . It is . Yeah ? Hello . I can barely hear you . Oh Joe . Yeah , yeah . Are you sure ? Fucking sure is good enough for me . I 'm on my way . I 'll call you with my details . On your way where ? You know , I gotta . Here you . You go ahead . I 'll catch a cab . - Everything okay ? - Oh yeah , yeah , fine . Fine ahh . Make sure Carlos gets those and have him start on the evaluation . - You 're not gonna handle this ? - What 's wrong with Carlos ? - Nothing , but .. - I love it when you agree . Where are you going ? - Nunavut . - Nunavut ? That 's like way up there . Yeah , permafrost catchy . And you 're doing this why ? Because I 've been chasing this Spanish Flu ever since I was your age . Why ? Because it killed more people than any other virus known to human kind . Right , and that 's something that excites you . Yeah ! Something that you can 't see with the naked eye and wipes out an entire civilization . It 's the bomb man . Eww ... So , when are you gonna be back ? Ahh ... I don 't know . Depends on the flight , which depends on the weather . And this is very important for your trip ? I don 't know why it got in there . - You 're so weird . - Okay so , listen . This is for food , and you know whatever else you might need it for . You gonna be okay on your own ? - I 've been my own for half my life . - Nice . It 's not a slam , it was a reassuring observation . Ah well , thank you then . Okay . I will see you . I will call you . If Mick ... you know , he had a dream too , he should like , totally go for it . - Absolutely . - And I should help him . - Of course . - Yeah , okay . - Bye . - Bye . Mick , hey hey . Hey , you ready ? Got a magic card . You drive like a madman . I didn 't see any traffic signs . Is this it ? That 's why it took over a year to find it . Church record said it would be out here somewhere . I found the dog tags right over here . This here is your Mr. George Edward Plane . In the permafrost since 1918 . What are you doing ? It smells good . Oh . Bob , I read your report . No doubt in your mind ? Bob ! Oh , Good night . The dental floss DNA , 100 % certain it 's him ? It only takes 10 DNA matches to convict a man to criminal case . I 've given you 20 . Zansinger is Martin Jamieson , the biological father of Daisy Markowitz 's baby . I guess we should be grateful for a terrorist who flosses . I 'm greatful for anyone who flosses . Um , have we started reviewing the AML trials ? David on top of it ? We don 't know where he is , do we ? - He probably does . - Yeah . Good night , Bob . Need some help ? No , I 'm okay . What the hell is that ? It 's his coffin . Should I be wearing one of those ? Oh , no . Just ah .. Stand back a little bit there Joe . So you done this before ? In The old days med students had to find their own corpses , so we 're just part of a grand old tradition . Grave robbing ? Oh , you 're fucking beautiful . You are one sick seal . Polar bears can smell that guy from 100 kilometers . Come on . Help me put everything back . And I mean everything . So ... So , now I do some ITPCR and some sequencing to see how degraded the RNA is . So , how about my money ? Oh . Sorry , man . And ... Joe , I tell you , if this works out . I 'm gonna get you ten times this . I won 't hold my breath . You keep this between ourselves , right ? Your dead guy will talk before I will . Actually , I 'm hoping he 'll tell us plenty . Your ride 's here , Dav . Okay . It was a pleasure doing business with you . You got any more frozen bodies , you know where to find me . I got what I need . So what did you tell your dad ? The truth . You told him the truth and you 're still alive ? - Yeah . Well , I left a note . - Oh , great . It 's not that I 'm going to lie . What I 'm doing is not wrong . Just checking ... Mick , those are a lot of pills . Mick , Mick . Maybe this wasn 't a great idea . I , I .. It is . It is . Amazing idea . Okay ? Hi honey . I 'm home . Lilith ? Hey dad . Um .. Did you find that virus ? Okay now . Don 't freak . Mick and I went off to look at whales . So .. Okay bye . It 's Lauren . I wanted to talk to you about the other day . My cell is 41 .. Hi David . Caroline asked me where you were today . Of course I didn 't say anything . Mainly because I 'm not really sure where you are . If you want to call me and tell me where you are so I can tell Caroline . , that would be really great . And I hope you 're having a fun time wherever you are . Hi . Hi . - I called . - Yeah . I just ah ... I literally just walked in the door . Look , ahh , David . I know that you think of me as that knee jerk grad student and that you don 't have a lot of respect . Do you want to come in ? No . And I want you to know that I 'm not the same person that I was back then . So you 're not gonna spend the night ? I just . I ah .. I truly believe that Dr. Booker is making a mistake by not stopping and looking at the data on his gene trial . Yeah you made that pretty clear the other day . I want to work with you to make sure that these are safe . Or .. - Sure you don 't want to come in for a glass of wine or ? - No . Just look at the data . And run every test that you can . You might be saving a life . - Thanks for listening to me . - Sure . - Albert Einstein , right ? - Ah .. No actually " Mork from Ork " . Oh . I get those two mixed up all the time . - Mayko Tran , I 'm over in Informatics . - Jill Langston , virology . - I know . Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . So you had the tour ? Pretty awesome , huh ? Yeah , it 's incredible . Is that lunch ? Sort of . Rabbit food . - Come on . I 'll show you where the fridge is . - Okay . - So you 're hooked up with David in Chicago . - He interviewed me there , yeah . Did he behave himself ? - I don 't know what ask .. - It 's okay . That 's why we love him . Hello David . How is ah .. Where were you ? Whose shit is this ? Oh . The new virologist . She 's already made herself home . What new virologist ? Oh shit . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . What 's she doing here ? - You hired her . - I did ? I 'm confused . Hello David . This is Jill Langston . I know . - She say that MIT , Stanford , Princeton .. - Not now Bob . What are you , ahh ? I mean . Can I ahh ... - In my office right away . - Sure . So no one told you I accepted the offer . I was out of town . - I hope it was a pleasant surprise . - No . I mean , I mean . Yes it was . It It was just .. I thought . - Hi Caroline . - Hi . - So you got Jill , eh ? - Yeah . - You 're settling in ? - Yeah . Yeah . Everything 's great . Find an apartment ? - I got a lead on a couple . - Good . Good . Jill was one of my early consultants when NorBAC was going through committee . Really ? I didn 't want to prejudice you until you two had a chance to meet , but I 'm happy it all worked out . - Yeah . Here she is . - Yeah . So I was just gonna take Jill into my office . Get her up to speed , that sort of thing . - Well , you better get right to it . - Okay . Ah .. Isn 't that gonna look a little suspicious ? What ? Closing the blinds . What ? - You 're closing the blinds . - Yeah . I do it all the time . When you have a woman in your office ? Yeah . So . Is it gonna be okay for you ? - Sure hope so . - Me too . Oh shit . Don 't go anywhere . I found it . That 's a very nice cooler , David . It 's the sample of the 1918 flu . - Perfect specimen . - What ? It 's impossible . - Is the RNA intact ? - I don 't know yet . But I got this sample out of the permafrost , so I 'm expecting minimal degradation . Wait a minute . I am on all of the dig list . I 'm hooked into the Norwegians , I get emails from Alexcovich in St. Petersburg . I mean it 's ... Where did you get it ? Well , I was a little off the radar . There 's no such thing . They ... Take months to plan . There 's red tape when you exhume a grave . I mean what if .. What if the media got a ... ? Just be thankful that you never , ever have to do that again . Because we got it . Yeah ? - Sorry . I didn 't mean to ... - Oh . That 's okay . - Have you two met ? - We have . What 's up ? I .. Mayko and I need to speak to you about the trial . Ah .. Okay , um .. I 'll get out of your way . Oh , and Jill . - Sequencing and PCRs ASAP . - Yes doctor . And uh ... Welcome to the lab . Thank you . What do you got ? So .. I did the pathology . Peroxidase stain showing the cancer cells of the Peterson boy , one hour after treatment . Two hours .. Most of the cancer cells are infected with the virus . Four hours , the majority of the cancer cells are dead or dying . Everything is going great and then .. Stroke and death . What went wrong ? Okay , so what if the Peterson kid had a hyper response to the virus ? You 've been talking to Lauren Folley ? I looked at her data . She 's not totally out there . Peterson could have had an allergic reaction to the virus . Could have caused the swelling that led to the stroke . Proof . Where is your proof ? Look at the Peterson 's cytokine profile in the chip right after injection . - It 's high . - Could have caused vessel damage . Could have caused the stroke . You got a problem with that ? Yeah , the ... Look . All three kids had high cytokine levels . One is dead . The other two are in remission . Okay , so is it the treatment or the disease that killed the kid ? Maybe the kid 's brain was set to go . You know it 's not uncommon in an AML patients . He might 've suffered a stroke with or without the treatments . You 're willing to bet lives on that Carlos ? The question that we are dealing with here is .. If 3,000 kids get this treatment , will 1 die or 1 thousand ? There 's no way of knowing at this point . Well , have you tried running a viral-load analysis ? Maybe DNA cariotyping the chromosome ? Come on , guys . Get out there . Be a little creative . We 'll get on it , David . What ? So uh .. You gonna find time to get involved with this ? Eventually , why ? Well , you seem somewhere else . You know , distracted . I 'm fine , Mom . New girl ? - Mayko , get the fuck out of here . - Okay , I 'm just ... checking . Bob . Excuse me , Bob . - Yes , Jill . - Hi . Um .. I need some yellow tips . - Help yourself . - Oh great . Thank you . Sure Jill . What is that ? Oh that 's " L 'air du temps " . - This is Clive Christian . - What ? Is that perfume ? - Aren 't they beautiful ? - Yeah . Oh , this is a classic . - " Evening in Paris " . - Oo la la . Yep , perfume is the father of organic chemistry . It 's been around since at least the Babylonians , 4,000 years ago . Wow . Yeah , the Egyptians perfected it . They were the first to use those little fancy perfume bottles , and Greek women and men , both wore perfumes . No kiddin ' . Yeah , they also used it in sacrifices . Yeah . Hi . Hey , how are you doing ? I 'm , I 'm okay . How are you ? Are you sure you 're okay ? You sound a little weird . Yeah . I 'm just on a bus . I don 't want to wake anyone up . Ah .. Where are you ? I left you a message . We 're on our way to look for whales . Yeah , what 's that all about ? It 's just something I have to do .. dad . Don 't worry . How was your trip ? Good . Look dad . I guess I 'll just .. I 'll call you again to let you know where I am or whatever , okay ? Ah .. Sure . Lilith . I love you dad . Bye . I love you dad ? Did you know that there were no Chanel 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 ? 5 was just Coco Chanel 's lucky number . Isn 't that interesting ? Hey Bob . Go home . Oh , okay . Good night . - Good night , Jill . - Good night , Bob . How you doing ? My stomach 's in a bit of a knot , but I 'm gonna finish the first sequence tonight . Don 't you just love the flu . I bet you say that to all the girls . - Oh , David . Is this gonna be weird ? - What ? Working together . No . Absolutely not . - For you ? - No . No . It 's good . Still you know ... What ? - I don 't know . Nothing , forget it . - No no no . What ? What are you gonna say ? Well , I mean .. Never has to get weird . If ... If we uh .. You know from time to time . How is that gonna make it less awkward at work ? Well , there won 't be any of this pent-up sexual tension between us . What sexual tension ? Look , David . I 'm not the girl who sleeps with the boss . Oh . Okay , you 're fired . You want to come over tonight ? You 're very very bad man . Oh really .. Come on . I consider us equals . It 's not like ... It would be an abuse of my power or anything . I wouldn 't treat you any differently then ... See right there . That 's the problem . If I 'm sleeping with someone I like to be special to him . You know , I want to be treated better than ... strangers or ... colleagues , random . Excuse me . - So you understand ? - Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Won 't mention it again . And I 'll just be up in my office , if you change your mind . Shit . No , I appreciate the update from you guys . Yeah , they 're still picking the Miranda apart . It 's a tough one . They 'll figure it out . Keep me posted on what you find out about Jamieson . I know you will . Thanks , Collin . Bye . Well , now that we 've confirmed his identity MI5 's taking the lead on Jamieson . What have you got ? I don 't know , might be nothing but I thought that I should throw it into the mix . Booker 's stock portfolio ? He 's showing a particularly heavy investment in Appliex Pharmaceuticals . What made you go there ? Well , you don 't like him , and usually have excellent instinct , so ... Is it legal to be testing drug from a company you own a big piece of ? - Apparently so . - Interesting . Keep on it . Let me know what you find . No , I appreciate the update from you guys . Yeah , they 're still picking the Miranda part . This way . Just here . - David , this is John Ricci . - Okay . Thank you , Dr. Sandstrom . - Thank you for seeing me . - Oh , no problem . My wife , she asked me to thank you too . My pleasure . I 'm stil not 100 % sure what it is you want . - The gene therapy . Is it safe ? - Right . Mr. Ricci , please have a seat . And I just need to see you outside for a minute . We 'll just be a moment . What is going on ? David , he 's called like 10 times . He wants to talk to you . Mr. Ricci 's kid was turned down for the trial because he didn 't meet the criteria for the protocol .. - It 's not my problem . - Yes , it is . You 're supposed to be making the calls on this trial , instead of doing whatever you 've been doing . I 've been working on a little bit more important , alright ? Oh , okay . You 've got the father of a very sick boy in there . He wants to know if you think there 's something out there that might save his kid 's life . First he was getting better , doctor . He was doing okay with the chemo . The trial protocol only allowed non-responsive chemotherapy patients . Dr. Booker was following protocol . Yeah , sure . But that was when the trials first started . Now , Justin , he is ahh .. He 's not doing so good . What do they call it ? The drug ah ... - Drug resistance . - Yeah . Yeah , that 's it . Justin , he 's saturated with that chemo crap . It don 't work no more . He 's dying , doctor . Dr. Booker said that ... that you were gonna make the call . Yeah . Well , Dr. Booker shouldn 't have done that . There 's no miracles out there that I can see , Mr. Ricci . - That 's bullshit ? - Oh , no . - I didn 't say that . - Then what are you saying ? You studied the therapy . - Does it work or doesn 't it work ? - We 're not sure . Dr. Sandstrom 's going over the data . - When will you know ? - Soon . Soon . This is my number at work . My number at home and the cell number , that 's my older boy . Yeah , you call me when you know , okay ? Anytime . - Day or night . - I 'll call you . All right . - My boy , he 's not gonna die . - I 'll call you , Mr. Ricci . I promise . I 'm looking in your eyes . And I will hold you to that . Don 't ever do that again . Got you focused , didn 't I ? Everything we measured is the same in all the patients . Karyotype , viral loads , cytokine levels . There 's nothing to show that the treatment triggered the Peterson boy 's stroke . - And nothing to show it didn 't . - Okay , but .. Look ! It shouldn 't be that difficult . The treatment caused two kids to go into complete remission . Nobody 's saying it didn 't . Look , it 's the one death that you 're gonna have to deal with . So here it is . Make your call . - Hey . - Hey . How did it go ? I 'm okaying in the trials . You don 't sound so sure about it . It 's the right call . It 's a hell of a way to fight cancer . - Gloves . - Oh yeah . Hey , you got enough phenol solution ? You want me to get you more phenol solution ? No , that 's okay . Maybe we should hook him up to the robotics , you know . - It might go faster . - It moves fast enough . Sure . - I have better dexterity . - Exactly . Go away , David . I think I might want to sleep next to them all night . Wow . That 's a good thing I can work under pressure . You know , I haven 't had a disaster since the thing in ' 94 . When you uh .. took out the entire east wing in the biochem lab ? Yeah , you heard about that ? David . Do you know about this ? Appliex isn 't the only company to have a trial stopped . Six people died using that arthritis treatments . Well , it happens Caroline . I mean , you test the product on 5,000 people , nothing comes up and then you test it on 500,000 people suddenly you got some deaths . Okay , so what if I told you Booker worked on all three trial phases for the arthritis treatment ? Tells me he 's got lots of experience . None of this sends up any red flags ? Are you sure you haven 't already decided Booker 's the bad guy ? David . You 're pissing on the wrong tree , Caroline . I 'm gonna put a report on your desk tonight saying the trial should continue . Oh , okay . - So Folley was wrong ? - No . I just couldn 't prove she was right . Okay . - Yes . - It 's Caroline Morrison Oh , oh . Caroline , hello . How are you ? Good . I have some news on the leukemia trial . The senator was asking me about it just this morning . What do I tell him ? We 're recommending that the trial resumes . The treatment 's safe ? Well , that 's what the trial will tell us . We found no reason not to continue . Can we get Jim 's son into it ? I 've already enquired . Oh , I can 't thank you enough . Hello , Mr. Ricci . It 's ah .. David Sandstrom calling . Yes , sir . It was my pleasure . I have some .. Well , no no . It 's ... I 'm never too busy to make a phone .. Well , I would like to finish , though , sir . Thank you . I found nothing to suggest that the treatment caused the death of the Peterson boy . Yes , that is good news . However , uh .. To be honest with you I found nothing to suggest that it didn 't , so ... What I 'm saying is that it 's a very experimental treatment , but I am going to recommend that the trial continue . That is correct , sir . Well , okay . You thank .. You 're welcome . You 're ... Mr. Ricci . Very good , sir . Yes , thank you , sir . Goodbye . Lilith . Hello ? Hello ? Shit . Come on , Lilith . Hey , it 's Lilith . Leave me a message after the ... Hey . What ? What the fuck . What the fuck were you thinking ? Do you have any idea what you 've done ? What kind of shit you 're in ? Hey hey . What ? Oh shit . Yeah . All of it ? All eight viral RNA segments , Hemagglutinin , neuraminidase . Spanish flu . We got it , David . - Intact . - We got it . We got it . We got it !

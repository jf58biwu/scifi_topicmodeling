 Futurama [ 3x13 ] Bendin ' In The Wind CiWaN Froggy went a-Courtin ' ... And he did ride , uh-Huh ... Froggy went a-Courtin ' and he did ride ... Blah , blah , Bender 's great ... Froggy went a-Courtin ' ... And Bender is great , uh-Huh ... Oh , my God ! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time ! There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there . Is that one of those Led Zeppelins ? No , it 's an old Volkswagen van ! Mind if I take this old van ? Sure . You wanna dump the corpses out of there , it 's yours . Yeah , I 've gotten used cars before . What 's that ? One of those Jefferson Starships ? It 's called a van . And in light of the fact it 's not rocking , I invite you to come knocking . Ooh . Neat . It 's a triumph of German engineering ! The speedometer only goes up to 80 . It can 't go faster than 80,000 mph ? No , but it 's got a driver 's-Side floor and an eight-Track player ! Where 's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time ? Under the seat . Why won 't it start ? It needs gas . Wrong again , idiot . There is no gas . Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038 . Gas was an environmental disaster . We use alternative fuels . Like what ? Whale oil . Bender , lift it up to the can opener . Oh , no ! Last time , that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off ! Plus the magnet impairs your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs . What ? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer ? If you don 't open that can now , your fear will own you , and nothing 's worse ! Okay ! Okay , I can do this . It 's time to take life by the cans . Come on , you can do it ! Go on , you dummy ! Jimmy cracked corn and I don ' t care ... Ah ! Jimmy cracked corn and I don ' t care ... Ah ! Oh , no ! 'Cause the master 's gone away ... It 's toe-Tappingly tragic ! Doc , I can 't move my arms and legs ! What 's wrong with me ? This is the worst part of the job . Good news ? Bender , your hydraulics are shot . You 'll never move again . You mean ... ? Sorry , you 'll have to get a new one . Oh , no ! Poor Bender ! Well , let 's drag him to the curb . Wait ! Bender is my best friend . We can 't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma 's ashes . Oh , my life is over . I 'll never know happiness again ! Hello , there . Look ! It 's Patch Cord Adams ! He heals with the power of laughter . Come on , take it . Can 't move your arms ? No , or I 'd be strangling you right now ! Here 's a giggle ! Why do they use Windows 3000 as a prison guard ? Why ? Because it always locks up . For God 's sake , somebody kick his ass ! Well , so long . Get well soon . Oh , well , so long anyway . I 'm doomed . Everybody leave me alone ! I don 't want to be seen this way . You look so sad . Do you want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in ? Hey , the blues ! The tragic sound of other people suffering . That 's kind of a pick-Me-Up . That was great ! Thanks . Are you a fan ? I don 't know . Let me see . Oh , my God , you 're Beck ! I 'd get up to shake hands and steal your wallet , but my body crapped out . I used to miss my body too ... But then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster . We 've got a lot in common . I always dreamed of being a musician-Poet ... Who transcends genres even as he reinvents them . So do it . It 's easier than it looks . Thanks , but it 's hopeless . I 'll never be a musician now . Or maybe ... You 'll be the best musician ever . What 's this for ? Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast . Move those arms ! Use the power of mental thinking . Make it dynamic ! Yeah ! Congratulations , my friend . Why , ' cause I made an annoying noise ? I use those all the time in my music . Bender , I want you to be my new washboard player . All right ! Go Bender ! Go Bender ! Go Bender ! That 's my good friend Beck . I 'm off to rock a series of midlevel venues . Kudos , Bender ! You got mangled , and now you 're a singer . Both our dreams came true . Who wants to cram in my van , follow Bender on tour and live in the van ? I don 't know , Fry . I think I 'm too poor to follow a band around in a van . Move it ! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait ! Bad news , friends . My shell ran . Zoidberg , you idiot ! My outfit ! It 's ... Kind of cool ! I like it ! Me too , now that I 'm used to it . Then it was all on purpose ! You 're lucky to have me as a friend . But cross me , and I 'll turn on you like that ! There 's a destination ... A little up the road ... From the habitations ... And the towns we know ... A place we saw the lights turn low ... The jigsaw jazz and the get-Fresh flow ... Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts ... Two turntables and a microphone ... Bottles and cans ... Just clap your hands ... Just clap your hands ... Where it 's at ... Got a washboard stomach ... And a microphone ... That was a washboard break ... One bowl of Jell-O knuckles . That 'll be three pictures of George Washington . Oh , no ! My beautiful money ! It got ruined in the wash ! Mine too , even my change . Get lost , you moneyless hippies ! You heard him , freaks ! We don 't like your type around here ! These are the types we like . That was the best 40-Minute washboard solo I 've ever heard . The parts when I was awake blew my mind ! Check out all those broken robots . Howdy , fellas ! I don 't believe my broken eyes ! It 's Bender , the washboard player ! We caught your concert from here . You rock ! Bender , sign my chest ! It 's in that bin behind me ! Thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful . Hang in there , folks . I bet before you know it , you guys will be ... That 's so wrong ! They can 't just melt down broken robots ! Not right when they 're kissing my ass . Just cold chill . When I 'm upset , I write a song . I wrote " Devil 's Haircut " ... When I was feeling ... What 's that song about ? Yeah , I could write a song ! With real words , not phony ones like " odelay . " Odelay is a word . Look it up in the Becktionary . Ooh . I 'm working on my song . Hand me the Becktionary . No , the rhyming Becktionary . I 'd like to raise awareness about broken robots ... But what can I do ? I only weigh 8 pounds . Wait ! You know lots of rock stars , and they like to look like they care . We can all do a big benefit concert in San Francisco ! We can call it " Bend-Aid , " after me ! And you can sing your song ! And I 'll let you sing backup ! But remember who the star is . Me , Bender . All right . " Hands in the air " rhymes with " just don 't care " ... And finished ! Smells like something died in here . Surprise ! Can we crash here ? The colors in the van keep us awake . All right , but hands off the minibar . I forgot about TV . Living on the road , you realize life is better without it . Well , let 's see what 's on . Tuesday , Golden Gate Park ! Monsters of folkish alterna-Rock Will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid ! Featuring : Beck , Wailing Fungus , and special guest , Bender ! A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots . Yeah ! Hooray , robot ! Bender , you 're famous ! Yeah . This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you , doesn 't it ? Uh-Huh . Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I 've ever cared about . You know , when I first got broken , I thought my life was over . But look at me now . I 've got fame , money , groupies ... And it 's all thanks to being completely immobilized . That 's why I 'll be proud to go up on stage and say , " Look at me ... I am a broken robot ! " Bender ! You can move ! You 're cured ! Oh , crap ! It 's a miracle . I can move again . My music career is over . I don 't understand the biz , but wouldn 't being able to move help ? No ! Don 't you see ? I was a hero to broken robots . I was one of them . How can I sing about being damaged if I 'm not ? That 's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish . Wait ! That 's it ! I 'll fake it ! Don 't do that at the concert . I can 't stop . When I eat too much dirt , I get stuff in my throat . You are so disgusting ! I ... They 're beautiful ! Ew . You 're touching them ! I 've never seen pearls like this . You 're amazing ! I am ? At last ! Recognition ! Put your hands together for the folk stylings ... Of Cylon and Garfunkel ! Here 's a song that was beautiful when performed by my ancestor Art . Are you going To Scarborough Fair ? Parsley , sage , rosemary and thyme ... Remember me to one who lives there ... She once was a true love of mine ... We 're home . Let 's earn some bread . Get your love beads ! Can 't journey to your mind 's center without them ! Look at the colors ! These will go great with my soul . Glad you like them . I 've been making fine jewelry for years , apparently . I 'll take three ! Give me one , man ! I 'll trade you a bad poem ! And now , stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for ... Beck ! With special guest , Bender , the broken robot ! Bender rules ! Groove on , man ! Rock it , Bender ! Can ' t you hear those cavalry drums ... Hijacking your equilibrium ? Whoa-Oh , yah ! Midnight hags in the mausoleum ... That song doesn 't usually last three hours ... But we got into a serious thing , and then I forgot how it ended . Anyway , one last item of business before we go . Bender , to start your foundation for broken robots Here 's a big cardboard check for $ 14,000 . It 's been an emotional day for me . I don 't know what to say . Then maybe you should sing it . Lay it down , boys . Ladies , gentlemen , smoking heaps of machinery ... Whoo ! This is a song called " My Broken Friend . " People say my broken friend is useless ... But I say his mind is free ... There 's lots of things ... My mangled robot friend could be ... Kick it . He could make a good hatrack ... He only has to stand there ... Or a cheap doorstop ... He doesn ' t need to move ... Or a great big , giant thermos ... Giant thermos ... With a twist-Off top ... That would be good for soup ... He could be a storage closet ... For outdated pants ... I like ' em tight ... My broken friend could do it all ... Just give him a chance ... That robot has a tragic secret ... That I 'd like to share ... For real ? My broken friend is closer to me ... Than an ass to a chair ... Hm . That robot 's name I never told you ... Who 's that ? You could not foresee ... Give it up . I 'll say it loud and sing it proud ... His name is you and me ... Don 't melt me into a crowbar . It suffers alone ... Just ' cause I can 't move my arms and legs Hey . Or toss me into a trashcan . What are you doing ? Because I can ' t cook eggs . What are you doing ? ! Don ' t crush me into an anchor . What 's up ? Because I can ' t dance and sing . Hold it ! I 'm telling you , my broken friend Bender ... Put your hands in the air ... Like you just don ' t care . I 'm telling you , my broken friend ... Can do most anything . Cut it ! Cut it ! Yeah ! Cut it ! Curse my natural showmanship ! You big fat fraud ! You 're not really broken ! But you will be ! Bum rush the stage ! Get him ! Get him ! Whoa ! Oh , harsh ! I didn 't get my beads ! You , minion , lift up my arm . After him ! Everyone , prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers . What is this , the Year of the Jerk ? ! The Golden Gate Bridge ! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal ! Oh ! I forgot it 's a hoverbridge ! I forgot this isn 't a hover car ! Is that a problem ? Not if you 've lived a life without regret . I 'll save me ! Quick , grab his foot cuffs ! Whew . Phew . Bummer . Someone fat , get in my way ! Ah . I 'm broken again . I can 't move any part of me ! Good ! I 'm sorry I lied , Beck . I just wanted to make music with you . I never meant to hurt anyone Or help anyone . That 's some played-Out horsecrap ! But I know you don 't mean it . Apology accepted . So I can keep the check ? Over my dead career . Well , it was worth a shot . If you 're done scamming Beck , we 're heading home ! All right . Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up . Fry crack corn and I don ' t care ... Leela crack corn and still don ' t care ... Bender crack corn , and he is great Take that , you stupid corn ...

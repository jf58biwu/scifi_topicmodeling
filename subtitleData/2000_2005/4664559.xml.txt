 We got company . Attention , unidentified aircraft . This is Colonel Steve Conway of the United States Air Force . - Hi ! - Hi ! You 're currently flying in restricted air space . - Oh , damn it . - What ? You will follow us to the nearest landing area . If you fail to comply , we will not hesitate to shoot you down . What are you doing ? We don 't have time for this . Let me handle this . Sir , your craft is unregistered , and you failed to file a flight plan . Just what the hell do you think you 're doing ? Don 't you people have anything better to do ... than harass innocent people trying to get to Marrakesh ? Zip it , Grandpa . I 'm speaking to the pilot . Grandpa ? Well , I 'll have you know ... Sir , I am not gonna tell you again . It 's all right , soldier . I got special clearance . I 'm with a top-secret branch of the government . So if you don 't mind , we have a mission to get back to . Sir . This I.D. Expired six months ago . Great . When Marrakesh is overrun by mutant lizard people ... don 't come crying to me . Grandpa ! How dare they ! I 'm only 43 . Still a young man . Maybe a little frayed around the edges ... but who wouldn 't be between my work and raising two boys ? Crap . Who am I kidding ? My looks are going down the toilet ... faster than an unwanted pregnancy on prom night . I was Rusty Venture , boy-friggin ' - wonder . Now look at me . I can 't go on denying the world my extra-greatness . I should be out there mixing it up , having fun . That 's it ! I just need a little " me " time to put the spring back in my step . Oh , and a super-hot car ! Don 't worry , Brock . You 'll be able to kill guys again in no time ! And fly jets and do secret agent stuff . Hank and I are on the case . With our help , you 're sure to ace the agent 's exam , no prob . Whoa ! Look at those wheels ! Hey , Gloomy Gus . Hop in . I 've got a top-secret mission for you , buddy . I can 't . I 'm not a secret agent anymore . You don 't need a license for Operation " Get Me Some . " What 's got into you ? Come on , Brock . Two young studs like us ... we 're show ponies . We need to strut our stuff . What say we make the scene ? I gotta see this . Move over . I 'm driving . Where are you guys going ? And why are you dressed like the clown on my lamp , Pop ? Boys ' night out . Don 't wait up for us . Dean , you 're in charge . Ciao . You hear that ? I 'm in charge ... and I think it 's just about wittle Hanky 's bedtime . Oh , take a bow . Poughkeepsie ! Oh , hold on a sec . How do I look ? Be brutal . You look like a big ... doll . Rusty is back . Oh , pretty dead in here , huh ? Not a whole lot of talent . Doesn 't usually get jumping ' till 11 : 00 . And , you know , on a Friday . Can I help you gentlemen ? - Bud . - You got it , ape-drape . A Bud for Captain Mullet-head . How ' bout you , Professor ? I 'll have a Rob Roy . What ? So , teach me , Brock . I 'm a quick study . How do you pick up the women ? Just gotta throw the vibe out there . Well , the welcome mat 's out . Let 's see who comes a-knocking . Oh , Brock , check out the main stage , but don 't make it obvious . Rusty like . She 's looking at me . What do I do ? Give her , like , five bucks . Can you break this ? That 's a nice medallion you got there , baby . Oh , this ? Science prize , ' 79 . The best paper I ever wrote . Turned the whole gravity thing upside down . And that pun was intentional , honey . She 's totally into me . This is too easy . Where 's the capture and kill ? Bye ! Shall I follow her ? Be right back . - Hey . - Hi . OK . Let me get this straight . $ 15 , Grandpa 's catcher 's mitt , and you 'll be my slave for the night . - Give it . - The whole thing . Dude , I spit in that . I can 't do this ! Oh , you 're back . You didn 't miss much . Oh , one of them was dressed like a cheerleader ... and said she was nineteen , but she had a Cesarean scar ... and her face had more lines on it than a mirror at Studio 54 . - I gotta go . - Wait a minute ! You 're not allowed to ditch me ! You 're my bodyguard ! How can I be ? Leaving us so soon , hockey hair ? Compliments of the lady at the end of the bar . He 's coming over . He took the bait ! Excellent . It 's all going according to plan . Proceed with phase two , Dr. Girlfriend ... ensnarement . Make it shine , Gunga Din . Yes , Effendi . So I said , " Listen , my Dad invented Univac ... " so I think I would know . " Well , that uppity little T.A. Didn 't give me any more trouble ... the rest of the semester . You dog , you . That 's it , precious . Make him think you 're interested . Now , twirl your hair . Good . OK , run your finger around the rim of your ... oh , excellent . Just like that . You 're doing great , Pumpkin . So , I didn 't catch your name . Oh , crap ! We never planned for this contingency . Quick ! Make something up ! No way , Jose ! Drink it , slave ! Your master commands you . - Hey , Brock ! - Go to bed . Why would you dress like that ? Dean lost a bet , and now he 's my slave ... and he 's refusing a direct order to drink this . You never welch on a bet , Dean . Be a man . Drink it . You go to bed . Your father 's gonna be ... Brock looks like hell . Drink it . So , uh ... this is me . OK , Charlene . How ' bout I give you my number ... to my private two-way wrist communicator watch ? How about I give you a ride to your place ? Yes , yes . More tongue . Stroke his ear . Like that , yes . Yes . Oh , you 're good . You are good . That 's my good girl . What are you doing ? ! I was getting juice . I 'm thirsty . Do you have any condoms ? - What ? - Just a mo . Wait a minute . You 're not supposed to sleep with him ! Condoms . Rusty doesn 't need gadgets to please a woman . So you like it rou ... No worries , Brock . I 'll walk you through the written portion . Question one . You 're in Prague . A sniper 's in the window above you . There 's an alligator behind you and a grizzly bear in front of you . What do you do ? Do you ... Back somersault . Pry off the alligator 's jaw . Use it as a boomerang to take out the sniper . When he falls out the window ... the grizzly will go straight for the easier meal . The answer 's " C. " Morning , all . Hey , Pop . Wow , I 'm bushed . Didn 't get a lick of sleep . What happened to your neck ? Oh , this ? Love bite . You 'll understand when you 're older . Brock , I 'm all out of condom . Could you pick me up one if you go out ? OK , next question . You hear muffled whimpers coming from the trunk of a limousine . Well , I 'll see you fellas a little later . - However ... - Going back upstairs . The limousine has diplomatic plates . With my two coffees . Monarch 's outside . Rise and shine , lovin ' spoonful . Care for a little pick-me-up before round two ? Fun stuff ? Tell him you 're going out with the girls tonight or something . - I don 't care . - He 's not buying it . Oh , I know ! Tell him you think it 's moving too fast . Let 's cut right to the grate . How ' bout you swing by , I don 't know , I 'm thinking like six-thirty-ish ... and pick ol ' Doc up ? Oh , don 't be foolish . You don 't need to wash your hair before our date . OK , fine . I 'll pick you up at six ... - What ? - Thirty . I forbid it ! He wouldn 't take no for an answer . I have to go . Not unless you 're going to plant a bomb in his car . It 'll look suspicious if I don 't . Poison his drink ? I have to get ready . You 're falling in love with him . You slept with him , didn 't you ? Well , I scored your sample test , Brock , and , well , you did better than Hank did ... but let 's just say you 're gonna have to do awfully well on the physical portion . No problem . Your training begins now . Drink up ! Your ass is mine , Samson . When I get through with you ... you 're gonna eat lightning and crap thunder ! Looks more like he 's gonna drink eggs and crap ... eggs . Well , I 'm off on my date . Brock , watch the boys while I 'm gone , will you ? You 're still allowed to do that much , right ? I 'm a little worried about that hickey , Doc . Oh , Brock , don 't worry . I 'm not falling in love . That 's not what I ... And what would be wrong with that if I was ? The boys need a new mommy . Rusty needs a new mommy . We don 't even know who our old mommy was . That 's right . I 've never really told you about her . Well , she was ... That 'll be Charlene . Gotta run , boys . Don 't stay up too late ! Did you spit in this ? Don 't eyeball me , Samson . Drink it ! Come on , Brock ! You need strong cardiovascular and agility training . No . You 're nothing ! You 're weak ! Why do you even want to be a secret agent , boy ? You think you 're good enough ? Hank , seriously , when I get my license back , I 'm allowed to kill you . Sorry , Brock . I packed a lunch for you , bologna and cheese ... and I cut the crusts off the way I like . And I downloaded a bunch of crib notes into your communicator watch . You get stuck on one of the hard questions ... just look it up . What 's wrong ? What 's the matter ? I have something to show you all . Those of you with weak stomachs should leave now . What you 're about to see is a nightmare inexplicably torn from the pages of Kafka . Holy crap ! What happened ? Apparently , this is the reward I get for years of screwing with super science . In short , I pissed in God 's eye , and he blinked . Golly . Does it hurt ? No , but the poking does . Let 's stop that now . Sorry . Hey , what 's H.E.L.P.eR. Gotten into ? That appears to be my dermis . Wow . I bet if you put that under your pillow ... the tooth fairy will give you , like , a grand ! OK , Hank , you are taking this way too well . Well , gee , Dad ... we 've seen a lot of strange stuff over the years . Last week we were fighting a giant dinosaur . Granted , but I wasn 't the dinosaur . Can 't you see where this is maybe different ? Where 's Brock ? Where 's Dean ? I can 't believe I 'm hearing this ! He 's turned you against me with his oily sex ... That cunning Casanova . I 'm not against you . I just feel bad about what I did . You should ! Screwing him was never part of the plan ! Not that . I mean injecting him with that horrible serum . No , see , that part you should feel good about . That was the plan ! He 's not such a bad guy if you take the time to get to know him . You two actually have a lot in common . Yeah , we do now . I didn 't sleep with him . Prove it . What the hell am I going to do ? H.E.L.P.eR ! I need you to be my hands if I 'm to find an antidote to this dilemma . OK , we 'll start with the chlorophosphate . Maybe a little diasporous peptides . A little ... ugh ! The green one , the red one , and the blue one ! Yeah , I 'm here to take my ... secret agent test . Ah , Mr. Samson . Excellent . OK . Please empty your pockets ... of any pieces of paper you might have on your person ... and I 'll escort you to the testing area . Oh , and please remove your two-way communicator watch . Damn it . No . Bad robot . Bad H.E.L.P.eR ! We don 't do that ! We do not eat test tubes . Come here . I 'm not playing games here . What ? You don 't feel well now ? Well , what did you expect ? You 're mixing acids and bases there . No ! H.E.L.P.eR ! No ! This test will test your acumen with firearms . - You 'll have two min ... - No guns . I don 't use guns . The nine millimeter Glock is standard issue to all agents in the field . - You 're required to ... - Guns are for ... Oh , just do it , H.E.L.P.eR ! Use the special hand attachments I gave you ... and just pull the trigger ! Oh , you ungrateful metal pansy ! Some help you ... Well , let 's see here , Mr. Samson . On the driving portion , you totaled every car but the one you were driving . On the pistol range , you refused to use a gun . And oh , ha ! Yeah , here 's my favorite . On the written , you drew a little guy with wings ... from the Led Zeppelin records . Icarus . So , uh , what are you trying to tell me here , little man ? That you don 't like Zepp ? My father is General Traceter . You saved his life . The man spoke of you as a god ... and you did not disappoint . Oh , yeah . I used to baby-sit you . Hey , Pop . What are you doing ? I don 't know . I can 't stop myself . I 'm compelled . Looks hard . Not really . The little back legs do most of the work . Can I try ? Listen to me , Hank . I don 't know what 's gonna happen to me when I finish with this . I could turn into something new and hideous , monstrous . Upon exiting this horrible thing , I might try to kill one or all of you . Golly ! Do you know how to fire a shotgun , Hank ? Answer me ! Daddy , there 's a lady with a super-deep voice here to see you . Charlene ? No ! She can 't see me this way . Tell her I ... Hi , sweetie . So now you know why I haven 't called . That 's our cue , wuss . Are you really gonna kill Dad ? You 're a worm , Rusty . I would have called , but ... Oh , right . This . I 'm in the super science racket . These things happen . So , I guess this is good-bye . I will remember these last few days with you ... as the happiest of my life ... well , except for the caterpillar part , I mean . Could I have one last kiss before I leave ? Well , all right , but don 't touch those thick hairs on my back . I think they 're my new ears . Wow , you 're a dirty girl ! This is turning you on , isn 't it , you little slu ... Hey , if it isn 't Franken-mullet . What can I do you for ? What the hell happened ? Go , Team Venture ! That 's good soup !

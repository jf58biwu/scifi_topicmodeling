 ¶ ¶ [ Radio . ' Easy Rock ] ¶ Standin ' at the corner station like I left you ¶ ¶ With eyes so soft it felt like I would die ¶ ¶ you wore a yellow necktie and glasses ¶ ¶ So I had to ask you ¶ ¶ Charlie ! [ Screams ] Andy . ! - Daddy , what 's going on ? Where 's Mommy ? - We have to go . She 's okay . Andy , get Charlie ! - [ Rifle Shot ] - [ Screams ] Mommy ! Mommy ! Come on , come on ! [ Rifle Shot ] [ Panting ] Hey ! Let me shut down . Where 'd you get the coffee , brother ? Hospital 's got a coffee shop . Tastes like Band-Aids smell . Love that smell . Shall we go ? Aren 't you gonna ask me how he is ? How is he ? You could just go up there and then you 'd know , wouldn 't you ? I 'm gonna be late . Do you want a ride or not ? Change of plans . I told Dad I 'd d stay . Knock yourself out . Hey , he wanted me to give this to you . Tell him no thanks . No givebacks ! [ Laughs ] [ Woman ] Gil , good . Here 's the address index . Got any victims for me ? Yeah . Uh , Mary Conant . Fresh meat ! Congratulations , Mrs. Conant . You have won the class-action lottery . Yep , one more and we close the Western Region . Two more . This one 's top priority . No , no , I already closed this one twice . Joel wants you to take another crack at it . She 's dead . Did you tell him that ? You don 't move up by telling the boss things he doesn 't want to hear . You do what you 're told , and keep filling out that time card . [ Woman ] Morning , Tommie . Sarah ! I 'm sorry . I got caught up . Really ? Let 's see ? Come on , let me see . We have , uh , Zinc , A History of the Vertical-Retort Smelting Process in America . Ooh ! Hard to put down . It 's fascinating . Where 'd you find this ? Somebody just left it on the table . It 's a Ph.D. thesis , and unpublished theses go in the- - Come on , you 've been working here a week . In the morgue . I can put it back . Thanks , sweetie . [ Knocking ] Joel , you got a minute ? Vincent , come on in . How 's the West coming ? We 're down to the last names . Good , good . I need those people located by the end of this week . That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . This file came back to us , Charlene McGee . Mm-hmm . I sent it back . I 've cleared this file twice already . There was an explosion in 1 989- - No body was recovered . Right . But according to the coroner 's report , the fire was so hot it would 've consumed everything . Even the teeth ! It 'll just slow us up if we waste our time tracking down a corpse . The head of RD requested we make another effort on this one . What does Research and Development have to do with the settlement ? Not a thing . Then why- - Look , Vincent . I pay you to find these people whether it 's easy or not . Yes ? Yes . Then find her , Vincent . Shut the door on your way out . Yes , sir . [ Sarah ] Tommie . ! You startled me . I found another one . If people would just put things back in the first place . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Gil ] Having any fun yet ? [ Vincent ] Are you kidding ? I 'd do this for free . " James Richardson " ? Yeah . He 's been drawing a pension from Millington College , but they have no address . So how does he get his money ? Apparently he shows up in person , collects his check and cashes it . Sounds a little paranoid . Yeah , well , anyway , I figured you 'd stake out the registrar 's office and wait for him to show . That 's great , but I gotta go to Reno to close Conant . I can 't hang out hoping this guy pops up . You go . I just find them . I 'm not authorized to cut a check . But you haven 't found him yet , have you ? It 's only a two-hour drive . Do I have a sign on my back today ? Fine , I 'll find him . Joel didn 't cut you any slack on McGee , huh ? Nope . You want her , you can have her . Just make sure you bring your shovel . Bye . [ Woman ] I can 't believe you did that . That 's so stupid . [ Man ] I 'm stupid now . Yeah , you 're stupid . Mm-hmm . But I like stupid . Excuse me ! Just gotta put the book back . Okay . Did you see her staring ? [ Sighs ] God . [ Vincent 's Voice ] My name 's Vincent Sforza , with Systems Operations Corporation . According to our records , a James Richardson ... participated in an experiment here at Millington in 1 979 . A class-action lawsuit was settled in conjunction with that study ... and he stands to receive a very large payment . If you wanna leave a message , we could give it to him when he picks up his check . I don 't suppose I can have an address or a phone number . No , we don 't have that , and even if we did- - Try the phone company . That 's the first place I tried . Um , how often does he come in ? One time , he didn 't come in for a whole year to get his check . Once he came in three times in one day . So , who knows ? Does your office have contact with any other people from the program ? Anyone who might know where he is ? No , but if it 's names you 're looking for , try records from the program . They should still be on file . That 'd be great . Do you know where l could find those ? I 'm sorry ! Sorry . Sorry . We call the archives " the morgue . " Of course , that 's not the official name . I suppose an official morgue would have dead bodies in it . Most of these documents used to be classified . It wasn 't till the past year that they became public . They 're not even cataloged yet . We don 't have the staff for it . It 's a struggle to get students to major in library science . I can imagine . Not just here at Millington . There is a nationwide shortage of qualified librarians . It 's a national disgrace . Here we are . Et voila . ! [ Sighing ] Great . Seventy-five . Seventy-six . [ Mumbling ] Seventy-nine . Okay , let 's see what we got . [ Reading To Himself ] " Sixth in a series of blind tests conducted in 1 97 9 , Lot 6 was tested on 1 2 students with ages ranging from- - " Blah , blah , blah . Come on , give me something . " The results were an immediate and statistically verifiable increase in- - " " Psychic abilities . " " Positive results from Lot 6 were offset by drastic side effects . " One subject died during the initial tests from self-inflicted wounds . " Of the survivors , six developed severe mental illness , and three committed suicide within two years . " ¶ ¶ [ Hard Rock ] Where did you come from ? [ Moans ] [ Moaning ] I have- - l have to go . What ? I gotta go ! You have to go ? I have to go ! Wait a minute ! You can 't just work me up and then take off ! Hey ! Come on . ! you bitch . ! - You have to stop it ! - [ Charlie ] I don 't want to . - Charlie , you have to stop this ! - I can 't . [ Ringing ] This is Vincent . I got your package . Hey , brother . Where 'd you get the tape ? The library at Millington . But I didn 't have a machine that could play it . Can you do a transfer for me ? Already done . Check your mail . Ah , you 're a digital god . Hold on a second . [ Sighs ] Hold up . Vincent , what the hell is this ? I don 't know . I haven 't seen it yet . You didn 't do anything illegal to get it , did you ? No , not really . Why ? Just play it . What is it ? [ Audio : indistinct , Distorted ] What the hell are we looking at ? [ Vincent ] I don 't know . Looks like some kind of experiment . This is riveting . Keep watching . [ Patient Groaning ] [ Patient , Very Agitated ] [ Woman Patient Screams ] The next time you send me something like this , would you put a warning label on it ? Let me call you back . Bye . [ Sarah ] No , it 's not a problem . Of course not . Sure thing . Okay , bye-bye . Some documents are missing from the archives . What 's been taken ? I 'm not sure exactly . Who 's been in there ? The sign-in sheet 's over there , so- - Tommie , um- - Tommie . ! Joseph spent his entire life in pursuit of science . The university 's reaction , an absolute disgrace . Mrs. Wanless , people forget it was a different situation . Exactly . The Soviet Union had already made tremendous advances in this area . The Lot 6 program was an opportunity to narrow the gap . What sort of drug was it ? Di-lysergic triune acid . One of several new psychotropics tested . I don 't recall the others . But Joseph thought Lot 6 was a real breakthrough . He felt terrible for those people , of course , but you have to make sacrifices for knowledge . Did Dr. Wanless keep any personal records of his research ? Of course . Come with me . This way . I kept all of it just as when he was alive . You know if he did any follow-up on the Lot 6 program ? Oh , Lot 6 , that 's here . This is what you want right here . May I ? Oh , yes , certainly . [ Reading To Himself ] " Covert surveillance was maintained ... " on the four subjects who demonstrated no overt adverse effects : Mary Conant , Andrew McGee , James Richardson ... " and Vicky Tomlinson . " In an unexpected turn of events , McGee and Tomlinson were married that year and produced one child in 1 98O , Charlene McGee . ' Charlene McGee wasn 't part of the original study ? No , she was a mistake . [ Reading To Himself ] " Charlene McGee , a.k.a. Charlie McGee , " a.k.a. ' The Firestarter . ' In 1 989 , it was determined that the child had unprecedented- - " What 's pyrokinesis ? She lights fires ... with her mind . " She was remanded to the custody of the state . Her father refused to cooperate , resulting in the incident at Mander 's farm . " is there any more on Charlene McGee ? Yes , there 's a film somewhere . Joseph saved everything . He has more pictures of that little girl than our own boy . [ Doorbell Rings ] I 'll just be a moment . Could you hit the lights , please ? [ Andy ] They found us . Hi , Charlie . Go away . Go away and leave us alone . Can 't do that . And you 're fresh out of places to hide , Andy . You can 't have her . It 's not up to you . We all want what 's best for Charlie , don 't we ? Come here , honey . You 're not taking my daughter ! [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Charlie , stop it ! Charlie , listen to me ! Stop it ! Charlie . I can 't . Charlie , you have to stop it ! I don 't want to . What 's wrong ? Go sit down . Nothing . I 'm m okay . I 'm okay . You sure ? Y-Yeah . It was just the lights . They made me dizzy , is all . Have we met before ? No . You sure ? You look very familiar . I don 't think so . I 'm Vincent ... Sforza . Tommie Andrews . Miss Andrews is doing her thesis on my husband 's research into human psychic potential . Outside the library . What ? That 's where we met . Outside the library . I bumped into you . I work at the library . There you have it . So what is your interest in Dr. Wanless ? I 'm doing a follow-up study . What are you following up ? An earlier study . Mr. Sforza 's looking into the role Joseph 's research played in winning the cold war . Maybe I can save you some work . There 's no reason why we should both have to dig through this raw data . I can send you a summary when I 'm m finished . That 's sweet , but I 'm m looking for very specific information . Really , you 're both perfectly welcome to examine my husband 's files ... for as long as you need . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] That 's me . Would you excuse me ? If I could take these files and make copies- - You know I won 't allow that . I 've tracked down some of the stuff we didn 't have access to . Some of the original files from the study . It 's pretty disturbing . I mean , some of the things they did to these people , Joel . And this relates to finding Richardson how ? Because I would hate to think that you 're wasting my time . [ Vincent ] There 's names and addresses in those files . I could probably find Richardson through his parents or relatives . Who knows , I may even find Charlene McGee for you . [ Joel ] That would work for me . We still have serious concerns about Radiant Thunder . Specifically , staging the test in an uncontrolled environment . is it too late to move the operation to a government facility ? Radiant Thunder was designed to fight the undeclared wars of the 21 st century . That means hitting targets in the midst of a civilian population ... with total surprise and complete deniability . You can 't test it on a government facility . It defeats the purpose of the test . But the target- - a bank ? Yes ? That 's correct . You 're using these children , the most advanced weapon system created , to rob a bank ? It 's not about the bank . Think about what robbing a bank entails . Crowd control , penetrating a hardened structure , targeting a specific objective . We understand all that . It just seems so- - Mundane . Mundane . ! Yes ! And totally deniable . Nonetheless , we may have to postpone this operation . According to your own reports , Joel , there are former participants in the Western Region that have to be accounted for . These people are considered security risks . And they will be accounted for . You have my word . Gentlemen , thank you for your time . I have to get back to work now . Excuse me a minute , gentlemen . John , you didn 't do me any favors in there . So , where are we in tracking down the previous test subjects ? We 've found virtually all . " Virtually " means the opposite of what it sounds . We will locate all the surviving test subjects before Radiant Thunder . Even Charlene McGee ? With all due respect , John , Charlene McGee is dead . With respect , Joel , you don 't know anything . Even if she were alive , what makes you think she 's a threat to Radiant Thunder ? When she was 1 0 years old , she could produce 20,000 degrees of spot heat in less than three seconds . Enough heat for concrete blocks to explode . I 'd say that makes her a threat , wouldn 't you ? Aren 't you letting your imagination run away with you , John ? Joel , my job requires an absolute lack of imagination . John 's here . [ Boy ] Hi , John . ! Ohh ! Ohh ! There 's my boy ! There he is ! Whoa ! Look what I did . I took out his brains . Oh , yes , you did . Here 's the cerebellum , then here 's the cerebrum , then here 's the medulla . Can I have a puppy next ? Oh , well , if you 're a good boy . Oh ! You 're a heavy lump . Down you get . Let 's see how Cody 's doing . How 's my boy today ? Can I get you anything ? [ Boy ] Why does he get all the attention ? We can all do stuff . He doesn 't do anything . Yeah , I mean , what is so special about him anyway ? Soon . Soon . Why don 't you tell us the story about Charlie ? Those stories are so stupid ! Be nice , Paul , be nice . - l like it when she burns stuff . - The farm 's the best ' cause she gets to burn up people . All right then , gather ' round , gather ' round . Does anyone know what happened to Charlie after she burnt up the people at the farm ? She burned up more people . [ Chuckles ] No . No , not quite . Well , do you give up ? Do you want me to tell you ? No . Hey , stop it , you two ! Just stop it ! Well , Charlie and her daddy ran away . They went someplace where nobody knew them . And Charlie was very lonely . Then a big bird saw her from way , way up in the sky . And it swooped down and grabbed her with its golden claws . And it took her to a magic castle . And in the castle , there were toys and games and friends . But Charlie didn 't want to play . No ! Why not , Charlie ? My daddy told me not to . And since Charlie wouldn 't play , nobody liked her . Charlie was all alone . [ Crying ] There you are ! Don 't cry . Why not ? Because they can see you . You don 't want ... them to see you crying , do you ? I don 't care . Do you know what they 're gonna do ? I hope they kill me . No , you don 't . Yes , I do . It 's my fault Mommy 's gone and Daddy 's gone ... because I 'm m bad ! Look at me . Look at me ! You are not bad ! You 're a very beautiful girl with a very special gift . A great gift . They 're dead because of me . Your daddy 's not dead . Shh . He 's here , in a cell , like you . Yeah. I could take him a message if you want . How ? I take him his food . Why would you help me ? I , I don 't have that many friends . Everybody should have at least one great friend , right ? Besides , I know how you can help your daddy . Just give ' em what they want . No . Daddy said- - D-D-D-D- - Listen to me . You give them what they want , just a little , make them really need you , then you get what you want . My daddy ? That 's right . It 's up to you . What 's your name ? John . John , tell my dad I 'm m okay . Tell him I love him . Okay , Charlie , I 'll tell him . You have an intuitive grasp of child psychology . It doesn 't really matter whether she cooperates or not . She 's far too dangerous . She 'll have to be eliminated . Nobody kills that girl but me . Mary Conant ? [ Woman ] Who 's asking ? Gil James . I 'm with a company called Systems Operations . What do you want ? I 've got a check for you . A class-action suit . Some study you took part in . What are you saying ? I never joined any class-action suit . Well , I guess you must 've been one of the folks they just included ... along with the ones who filed . You were part of the study , right ? I 'm not interested . Please go away . Are you sure ? This is a lot of money ! Go away ! Or I 'll call the police . I 'm , I 'm sorry you feel that way . [ Whispering ] Go away . Go away . Would you like something ? I could make some tea . Oh , that 'd be great . Thank you . Excuse me . Could you pass me that ? Green folder . Thanks . So , what 's so special about Richardson ? Just a name on my list . You have a list ? The people who participated in this study won a huge class-action suit . My job is to find them and compensate them . Hmm . You think that makes it all right ? No , but at least it 's something . Who else is on your list ? McGee , Charlene . Do you know where she is ? I think she 's dead . Terminal burnout . You think this stuff s all funny , huh ? Not that she 's dead . But- - Some of this other stuff ? Come on . " Once the girl 's cooperation had been established , Charlene McGee participated in several tests to verify her pyrokinetic ability . Igniting in succession a five-kilogram block of wood , a concrete brick ... and a 1 985 Ford Escort . ' l guess a Pinto would 've been too easy . So you don 't believe it . What ? " Human psychic potential " ? Do you ? What do you think happened ? I think it was a scam to get research funding . And this Wanless guy made up this psychic power stuff ... so he could justify what he was doing to these people . I have this tape . And you should see , these experiments were horrible . I think you better leave now . Both of you . Sorry about that . She knew what he was doing . Wow , you 're cynical . So I 'm gonna have to come back tomorrow and apologize for your behavior . She liked me . Great ! You gonna share anything ? Why should I ? I 'll buy you a cheeseburger . [ Glass Shattering ] Who 's there ? No ! [ Sighs ] [ Knocking At Door ] [ Knocking Continues ] What do you want ? Go away ! [ Gil ] I 'm so sorry . ! Do you have a cat ? I just ran over somebody 's cat . God ! Did you kill it ? No . ! It 's alive . But he 's hurt really bad . Oh , my God . ! I 'm so sorry . ! I- - I think he 's crying . Poor guy . Come on , your mother 's coming . you 'll be all right . Just hang in there , buddy . No ! [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Gasping ] Excuse me . You never really told me what your research was about . No , I didn 't . What ? [ Laughs ] Do I have something stuck in my teeth ? What happens when you find the people on your list ? You said you give them money . I don 't actually hand them a check . I just track them down . So you don 't really know . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Hold on a second . Yeah , brother . What are you doing ? Having lunch with someone . Stop what you 're doing and open your laptop . It 's my brother . Sorry . Yeah . Okay . Open the file and push the resolution as far as it 'll go . Hello ? Are you still there ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm in the file . What 's the frame number ? 22-06-53 . Do you see it ? It looks like somebody threw a clipboard . What 's the big deal ? Look a little harder . Come on . What the hell is that ? This is top-notch work . The shadows line up , there 's no ghosting , no matte lines . I didn 't think they could fake something like this in ' 7 9 . I don 't think they did . Hold on . Tommie ? Tommie ! Brother , let me call you back . Tommie ? Tommie ! Tommie , you okay ? Did you see her face ? She didn 't even know what was happening to her . Well , I told you it was bad . I knew somebody who was a part of it . Really ? Who ? They weren 't part of your list . I 'm sorry. I never even thought of them as people . I wanted to help them or find a cure or something . That 's why you wanted the files ? How are you supposed to find a cure ? It 's not like you can open up the files and find red kryptonite . Red kryptonite ? Green kryptonite kills Superman , but red kryptonite just takes away his powers . You 're thinking of gold kryptonite , because red kryptonite , it just does weird stuff like split Superman in two and turn him into a baby . You like Superman ? I like Batman more . Really ? Why ? 'Cause he 's an ordinary guy , and ' cause in Dark Knight he kicks Superman 's butt . Yes , he does . Listen , I don 't know if it 'll help , but I don 't just have the tape , I 've also got these files . you may not wanna look at them , but you 're welcome to . Okay . Yeah , it 's Gill . Tell Rainbird I have just closed the Conant file . I couldn 't manage the note , but I think they 'll buy suicide . I mean , why not ? Check her file . She 's already tried it twice . Third time is the charm . Nice kitty-cat . [ Meows ] Found what you were looking for ? Mmm , not yet . That 's not a file . Ohh ! is this your father ? yep . He looks nice . He took a nice picture . is he dead ? Not yet . What did he do to you ? You don 't wanna hear about my dad . Sure I do ! What happened ? The usual . What 's the usual ? The usual : " Dad was never there for me , cheated on my mom , then he left . Treated my brother and me like we didn 't exist . " Mmm , the usual . How old were you ? When he left ? Nine . Oh , so you basically grew up without a father . Basically . Pictures are funny . You look so close , and you hate him . I don 't hate him . I can 't forgive him , but I don 't hate him . Yeah , I 'm sorry . It 's not your fault . I 'm still sorry . You still play football ? No , no . I , um , I ran cross-country in high school . Ohh ! I lettered ! Why is that funny ? Come here . I have to go . What ? I have to go ! We can stop if you want . What are you doing ? Did I do something wrong ? No. I can 't do this . Wait a minute . Hold on a second . Wait a minute . Talk to me . What are you doing ? Please don 't touch me . I like you , Vincent . I don 't want to hurt you . What ? Tommie ! [ Dialing Cell Phone ] Joel ... sorry to wake you . It 's Vincent Sforza . I found McGee . Charlene McGee . I found her . W-Wait , Joel . Don 't put me on ho- - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Yes ? Really ? Well , you better put him through . Hello , Mr. Sforza . John Rainbird here . Congratulations . I hear your persistence paid off . [ Knocking ] Yes . Do you believe in destiny , Joel ? No , sir . I believe in cash flow . I wonder what Vincent Sforza believes in . Tell me something about him . You have his personnel file . Does he appear to be ... trustworthy ? He seems honest . No . That 's not quite what I mean . I 've told him to bring in Charlene McGee , to persuade her to come in . We don 't have much time before Radiant Thunder . If he 's located her , we 'd better send somebody in to handle it . Hmph ! Charlie cannot be handled . If you 're counting on him to deceive her- - No . He thinks he 's trying to help her . You see , it 's easy to tell a lie ... when you don 't know what the truth is . [ Knocking On Door ] It 's me , Vincent . I need to talk to you . Go away . I know who you are . You 're Charlene McGee . Come on , Charlie , open up . Can I come in ? I like the fire extinguishers . Very Andy Warhol . You leaving ? Nope . Listen , this company I work for ? They 've got top scientists . If you came in and talked to them , I 'm sure they could help you . I can take care of myself . You can 't just run away like this . You saw the film . I can 't tell what happened ! I killed two people . That 's what happened . - They were trying to hurt you , right ? - They were just doing their job . You were 1 0 years old ! It 's not like they 're gonna charge you with murder . No , they don 't want to punish me . They want to use me . Let me get you the money from the settlement . Don 't touch me ! You 're afraid , aren 't you ? That 's good . Charlie ! Charlie , wait . Go away ! I 'm just trying to help you . Why ? Why ? Because I know what it 's like not to have anybody you can trust . It can get lonely . Everyone who 's ever tried to help me is dead because of me . What 's your idea of lonely ? Okay , fine . You win . All I 'm saying is that these people can have the cure that you 've been looking for . " These people " ? Your company ? Am I supposed to trust them ? What 's your alternative ? You think you 're gonna find it on your own ? This could be the best shot you have . Gold kryptonite ? Look , I 'm gonna be with you every step of the way . Nothing 's gonna happen that you don 't want to have happen . Will you at least think about it ? Just think about it . She 's coming in . Congratulations , Vincent . Good job . Thank you , sir . I 'd like to be there for the initial meeting . You would ? I told her I 'd meet her there . She 's had a rough life . It 's difficult for her to trust people . And she trusts you ? I think so . The thing is , Vincent , we have trained psychologists that do this . And they follow a very specific procedure . I 'd like to talk to them . You still have Richardson to find . Let 's stay focused here , okay ? Before I forget . Who restored that video file for you ? My brother . Your brother ? He did a good job . That 's good to know , Vincent . Thank you , Vincent . What happens when you find the people on your list ? You said you give them money . [ Vincent 's Voice ] I don 't actually hand them a check . I just track ' em down . [ Charlie 's Voice ] So you don 't really know . How can a name not be found ? I put it there . Yeah ? Yeah , Gil , it 's Vincent . Hey , Vincent ! Heard you found McGee . Kudos . Thanks . Yeah , listen . I 've been doing some bookkeeping . [ Gil ] Not exactly your department , buddy . I know , but I can 't find any of the payments . A.P. has several accounts that we use for disbursements . We 're trying to keep this class action on the hush , hush . There 's nothing on Conant or Pierce or Smithers , none of the people I found . Look , these people were paid . Everything 's been taken care of . All right ? So don 't worry about it . Okay ? - Vincent ! - Yeah , okay . Got any victims for me ? No . Oh , God . No . No , no , no , no , no . No , no , no , no . ! Before I forget , who restored that video file for you ? [ Phone Ringing ] Hello ? Henry , get out of your apartment right now . - I 'm making soup ! - I 'm not kidding.Just do it . What is this about ? It 's about that tape . Leave now , please ! Or what , the " Men in Black " are gonna come get me ? [ Vincent ] Just please leave . I 'm gonna download the tape . Henry , leave the tape . Just go . You can 't enter . This is a private facility . I 'm Charlene McGee . They 're expecting me . Building 1 4 , through the town , on the left . The town ? Yeah . The town . Charlie ? Just look at you . All grown-up . All right , Charlie , let 's go . Where ? Don 't you trust me ? Daddy ! Daddy ! What 's wrong with him ? They drugged him . [ Sighs ] I 'm in a lot of trouble , Charlie . They know that I like you more than I should . They know that I 've been helping you . But ... they 're gonna give me one last chance . What ? Come here . I don 't even like to ask you this . What ? Well , they want to use your power against a person , Charlie . No . That 's exactly what I told them . But then they said if you didn 't , then they would kill me . So , that 's why I brought you down here so that you could see your daddy . Because when I 'm gone , you 're never gonna see your daddy again . I 'm sorry I let you down , Charlie . John , I 'll- - Yeah ? He 's lying ! Everything he says is a lie . He 's the one who took you from me . He 's the man who had your mommy killed . That 's enough ! Have you ever looked into the eyes of a dying man ? [ Gasping ] You 've lost her . Charlie , wait ! No ! Flames ! No ! No ! Wait ! No ! No ! No ! No , no ! I saw you die . No . You saw me burn . It 's far more painful . Oh , don 't worry , Charlie . I forgave you a long time ago . I hope you 've forgiven me . Yeah ? You killed my father . I didn 't want to . He wanted to die , and he tricked me . And he left us both to take the blame . You still twist everything around . You haven 't changed at all . Oh , but I have . I used to look into the eyes of dying men ... for something to bring purpose to this life . God , I suppose . What do you want with me ? I want you to help me fill the void . What ? I want a God to judge me . I want a God to damn me so ... I 'm going to make him . You 're gonna make God ? You were the first step . We 've come a long way since then . You 're serious . I want you to come back . - Charlie ? - Ah , Mr. Sforza . ! We have you to thank for this happy reunion . Charlie , this isn 't what it looks like . Henry ? Henry ? Hey , buddy ! I 've already talked to Joel . We 're offering you a promotion . Oh , dear ! Gil . Mr. Sforza , you do realize that aiming a firearm at your employer ... is grounds for immediate termination . That makes sense . Well ? Well what ? Shoot me . I didn 't think so . Run ! Oh ! I swear to God , I didn 't know anything about any of this . Charlie , you 've got- - Shh . Oh , no . Come on . What the hell is this ? I told you she 'd come . Shut up . She knows . They 're like me . Don 't shoot me . Nobody 's gonna shoot anybody . We 're just gonna go out the way we came . I wasn 't asking you . I 'm telling you . Don 't shoot me . In fact , why don 't you shoot yourself ? In the foot . - Vincent ! - Very cool . [ Screaming ] Frankly , I don 't see what the big deal is . I 'm disappointed . I 'd even say I feel ... cheated . What about you ? Definitely cheated . All right . Let 's see what you 've got . My feet ! My feet are on fire ! My feet ! My feet are on- - [ Screaming ] Come here . Get on your knees . Stay ! You look just like I thought you would . Can you stand ? [ Gil ] Vincent , come on out . We don 't want to kill you . Mr. Rainbird wants you alive . But make no mistake . you 're not leaving this facility . Okay , okay . Here 's what we do . Vincent . Put the gun away . What ? You don 't need it . [ Gil ] Vincent . ! All right . Now lie on the ground . No . No ? No . But you can run if you like . [ Men Shouting ] [ Screaming ] Screw this ! [ Screaming ] Charlie ? is that inside you all the time ? I 'm sorry you had to see that . is that you too ? No , that 's not me . What are you ? Charlie ? You know what I can do . - You know what I can do ? - l don 't want to hurt you . I don 't want to hurt you ! I mean it . What are you ? Don 't make me do this . Charlie ? Charlie , stop it . ! Stop it . ! What 'd you do ? Let go ! More ! Let go . More . ! Let go ! Let go . More ! More ! Stop it . Stop it , stop it . More ! No , no . No . No . No more . Stop it ! Oh , don 't ! Don 't shoot him . Please . Charlie for the boy . That 's the deal . All right . Tell him to let her go . Cody . Now you lower your gun . No , I don 't think so . I think we 'll stay just like this until Charlie gets outta here . All right , Mr. Sforza . It 's your show . Get outta here , Charlie . Go . Go , Charlie ! He has no idea how interesting his life is about to become . John 's still alive . I know . You have to go back . No . No ! - Why 's John still alive ? - l don 't know . I promised Daddy I wouldn 't , okay ? I broke a promise for nothing . No , wait . No , I had to ! I had to ! Sometimes you have to break promises . It 's okay . No , it 's not okay . So do something . Let 's think . What do we do when we 're in trouble ? We run , we disappear . No . No . That 's the only way that we 've ever stayed safe . No . No . You 're lying . No . Mommy , Daddy lied , John lied , and now you 're lying . No , no , no . Everybody 's lying to me . Oh , sh-sh-sh . We don 't have to be like that . We never , ever have to be like that , ever . What are we gonna do ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know . [ Crying ] There isn 't a cure . You know what you have to do , right ? You have to go back . [ Man ] Miss . You have to go back . Miss . You have to go back . [ Knocking ] Miss , you can 't sleep here . Um , I 'm just waiting for my bus . - Which bus ? - Uh , Phoenix . You still got about 20 minutes or so . Thank you . You 're thinking about Vincent . You 're thinking , " Do I get on the bus , or do I go back for him ? " Excuse me ? The answer is , you go back . How did you find me ? I 'm not your enemy . That 's right . The whole world is my friend , and I 'm happy to be part of it . Are you one of Rainbird 's plants ? is that it ? You know better , Charlie . Well , if you know who I am , then you know what I can do . I know . Well , what do you want ? It 's complicated . Well , start at the beginning . Use small words . I was a friend of your family 's , Charlie . I was there with them 20 years ago ... when Dr. Wanless gave us the drug , when they changed us forever . Richardson . [ Gil ] Sir , it was just one big , uncontrollable mess , and then , before you know it- - She got out . How could you lose control of the situation ? Vincent took my gun , sir . Vincent took your gun . Yeah , he got lucky . He got lucky ? He 's an accountant . He doesn 't have access to this facility . He 's not supposed to be here . Mr. Rainbird told me to bring him in . Who signs your paychecks ? You do , sir . That 's right . You work for me . Vincent is supposed to be tracking down Richardson . You 're supposed to be closing . But I found- - You found McGee , yes , and look what happened . She blew up the facility , and now you have to find her again . Which means delays which cost money . Am I making myself clear ? Yes , sir . Find Richardson , Gil , because the trucks are rolling . Radiant Thunder may be over-budget , but it will be on time . Yes , sir . What was she like ? It wasn 't a big deal , okay ? - She set his shoes on fire . - Shut up . - She was hot too . - [ Snickering ] That 's funny . I told you to shut up , okay , Andrew ? Yeah , Andrew , shut up . And she wasn 't hot . She was old . You saw her too , didn 't you ? Good morning , John . Good morning . Quite a night last night , huh ? Yes , yes . Very exciting . Not the word I was looking for , but I see your point . A security breach of this magnitude less than 2 4 hours before Radiant Thunder- - But if you 're excited , I 'm excited . Look , look , look , look . Watch Cody . What else did she do ? Nothing . She tasted sweet . Wow . The kid doesn 't say anything his entire life , and now he put three whole words together . Way to go , Cody- - your first complete sentence . What- - do you think she 's your girlfriend or something ? She didn 't want to play with us . I guess it made her mad or something . She was lame . Okay , guys ? She was lame . End of story . She played with me . Don 't you see it ? See what ? Just look at him ! He 's more responsive , he 's interested . The potential has always been there , but he 's never had enough energy to fuel the change . But Charlie has all the fuel that he needs . To change into what ? I 'm not quite sure . John , how much did you know about our unscheduled visit last night ? I know how devoted you are to this project , sir . But I also know how important it is for you to tie up certain loose ends , and I 'm hoping Charlene McGee is not going to distract you from the big picture . Thank you , Joel . I do appreciate your candor . Thank you , sir , and I hope you understand I 'm speaking from a position of deepest respect . Of course . So , what are you doing about Vincent ? Joel , you like having plausible deniability , don 't you ? From a legal standpoint , yes . Then don 't ask too many questions . [ P.A. Announcer ] Kansas City , Topeka , St. George , Las Vegas and Barstow now boarding- - So , how well did you know them ? Everyone knew Vicky . She had this laugh . Once it got going , she couldn 't stop it , so all the kids were always trying to crack her up . You liked her . Yeah , but she didn 't even notice me , not after she met Andy . I mean , you 'd just look at them , and you could see ... that they fit . Vicky and Andy . Dating- - that 's cool . Why do you think they did it ? What ? Lot 6 . Well , a hundred dollars was worth a lot of money in 1 97 9 , and it was at the school . It should be safe , right ? A lot of us had- - We couldn 't adjust to the change . You know , you modify a couple of proteins , and- - [ imitates Explosion ] [ Chuckles ] You know , your parents were very strong to last as long as they did . You adjusted . No . I went crazy . Well , you don 't- - l mean , you 're not crazy . How 's your coffee ? Tastes like cigarettes . What have you been doing for the last 20 years ? I 've been waiting for you . How 'd you know where l was gonna be ? Because this is where we meet . That 's not really an answer . It is an answer , it 's just not the answer that you want to hear . What do I wanna hear ? Chain of events , cause and effect . The universe doesn 't really work that way . There 's no past , there 's no future . It just is . You are crazy . And you light fires with your mind . I used to be like everyone else . I used to walk through my life facing backwards , only seeing where I 'd d been . And then they gave me Lot 6 . Now I see everything . I see the past , I see the present , I see the future . I see everything ... all at once . And it 's time to go . We have to go now . What ? Why ? Because they 're looking for you , and in less than a minute they 're going to be walking through that door . Well , I 'm not going with you . That 's what you say , but it 's not what you do . Why should I believe you ? Don 't . Hang out another minute and see what happens . [ Moans ] Hi . [ Gasping ] Hi . I 'm Max . Do you want me to show you where your thyroid is ? Max . Thank you . Hello . Do you know where you are , Mr. Sforza ? No . You 're in the Systems Operations day care facility . Are all of them- - Special ? Oh , yes . Very special . Now , look . I 'm going to say two words to you , Mr. Sforza , and you 're going to tell me everything you know about those words . Charlene McGee . You can see the future ! No , I don 't see it . I 'm in it . Everything 's already happened , and I can 't change anything . Everyone has a choice . No , they have the illusion of choice . It 's not the same thing . You 're wrong . Am I ? Why did you go back to Systems Operations ? Vincent said that they could help me . And you believed him ? It doesn 't matter now . It does matter . Everything matters . It 's all connected . What happens to Vincent changes everything . What do you mean , " what happens to Vincent " ? You got away . Vincent didn 't . I didn 't ask him to do what he did . He had no choice . And I don 't either , right ? I have to save him ? No . So I don 't go back for him ? You go back for him . You don 't save him . Vincent dies . Vincent- - You don 't mind if I call you Vincent , and , of course , you must call me John . - What are they doing ? - Helping . you 're in complete control , Vincent . you can stop anytime you want . All you 've got to do is to talk to me . Tell me about her , Vincent . You 've seen the files . You know more than I do . What I want isn 't in the file . I want to- - l want to know what she 's like . I don 't understand . Well , does she still suck on her lower lip when she gets nervous ? Does she- - Mmm . Does she fall asleep when you tickle her back ? I want to know her . I missed her growing up , you see . Where is she , Vincent ? I don 't know . [ Screaming ] Does she have someplace to go- - someplace safe ? I don 't know . God , I don 't know ! I swear to God I don 't know ! And I 'm glad , because if I did , I 'd d tell you . Yes , I think you would . Hmm . Paul , ask him how he found out about us . You already know that . Your eyes- - they 're burning . [ Grunting ] They 're melting . [ Groaning ] [ Phone Rings ] - Hello ? - Henry ! Get out of your apartment right now . I 'm making soup . What is this about ? Just do it . It 's about that tape , Henry . Get out right now . Or else what- - the " Men in Black " are gonna come get me ? - I 'm gonna download the tape . - Just leave the tape.Just go . Henry ? Henry ? - Hey , buddy . - Where 's my brother ? We 've got the tape , got you . I think we can let your brother slide . There never was a class-action suit . You killed those people . Yeah . You brought them to me . Why ? Why do you think , Vincent ? It 's what we 're paid to do . Close the Western Region . - No comebacks . - Comebacks from what ? Radiant Thunder . [ Vincent Screaming ] Gil . ! Gil told me ! [ Moaning ] All right . Well , as I told you before , you 're in control . - We 'll stop whenever you want . - I 'd d like to stop now , please . And if you get him out , then what ? You 're the psychic . Just because I know something doesn 't mean I understand why . I thought I didn 't have a choice . But you think you do . Well , I don 't know , you know ? Vincent knows about me , and he 's not afraid . So- - He 's not afraid of you ? Come on . Forget it . What ? Oh , you think you and Vincent are like your parents . Look , I said forget it , okay ? I wish things were different for you. I really do . Yeah , you think you know everything , don 't you ? I do . Well , I am really getting tired of all this metaphysical crap . Do you think I like it- - knowing everything that 's gonna happen every second , every day ? When they gave me that drug , they destroyed my life as surely as they 'd put a bullet through my brain . Ah , but you 're gonna burn their house down . That 's what Rainbird wants . Every time I lose control , every time I kill , he wins . I 'm gonna save Vincent , and that 's all I 'm gonna do . Whatever you say . And you know what ? You don 't have to patronize me , because you may think you don 't have a choice , but I do . [ Chuckling ] Okay . Okay . Okay . You passed out . Here . Take this . Come on . It 's only water . I could make him drink it . Whoa-oh-oh-oh . Not too fast . Ooh-ooh . That 's better . Hmm ? Yeah . You 've got to save all your strength . Now , Vincent , just because I 'm torturing you ... doesn 't mean to say that you 're not part of my team . I 'm not part of your team . [ Scoffs ] But of course you are . I mean , you 're the one that found Charlie . I 'd been looking for her for 1 0 years . I didn 't find her . You did . [ Cody ] I 'm hungry . You didn 't stop with her , did you ? How many drugs did you test ? What- - Lot 7 , Lot 8 ? How many ? Well , you should know . I mean , you were tracking down all the failures . I think we finally perfected the process with Lot 23 , and these fine young men here are the happy result . Lot 23 ? Yes . It seems overwhelming , I know , but we were just developing a technology like any other . Ours just happened to be a gene sequence on the 1 7 th chromosome . You can 't just go around treating people like they were experiments . Oh , I do . [ Cody ] John , I 'm hungry . [ Electricity Arcing ] [ Grunting ] What 's with him ? I think the boy 's hungry . Hmm . You see , Cody is an energy sink . He absorbs energy- - electricity , heat , life . [ Electricity Arcing ] [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] Life ? What is life if not energy ? Yes , he absorbs life . He consumes life . I 've only met one other with a power to match his , but , of course , you know all about her , how I taught her everything . And when she left me- - Well . Hmm . That 's the reason I only work with boys now . Oh , look at this . Hmm . [ Sniffing ] Hmm . I bet she looked beautiful wearing this , didn 't she , hmm ? Mmm . Mm-hmm . I wouldn 't know . Now , you just tell me , what exactly happened when you two were alone ? Hmm ? Nothing . He 's lying . Did you- - did you ... sleep with her ? That 's none of your business . [ Whispering ] Did ... you ... sleep ... with ... her ? [ Man ] Case number 9 1-1 99O , Mary Conant . Body is that of a well-nourished adult Caucasian female ... approximately 48 years old , brown hair , brown eyes . The body is ... 64 inches long , weighs 1 25 pounds . Skin is of normal texture , appendectomy scar , no tattoos or other markings visible . [ Thinking ] I 'm alive ! Manner of death is believed to be self-inflicted asphyxiation . Cause of death appears to be a dry cleaners plastic bag ... which was removed from the head of the deceased at the scene ... and placed into evidence . Help me . I will now examine the brain of the deceased ... in order to determine the mechanism of death . [ Thinking , Whimpers ] [ Whirring ] [ Motor Slows , Stops ] [ Clicking Switch ] [ Whirring Resumes ] - Help me ! - Aaah ! [ Sports Announcer Over Radio , Indistinct ] May I help you ? John Rainbird . Excuse me ? John ... Rainbird . We don 't have a John Rainbird . Are you sure ? He 's not on the list . What division is he with ? Research and Development . Nope . Try kidnapping and murder . Sss-ss-ss-ss-ss . [ Chuckling ] [ Alarms Beeping , Blaring ] Hey . ! Hey . ! Hey , you can 't go in there ! Hey ! [ Alarms Continue ] All right , boys . Back to your room . [ Babies Crying ] [ Children Chattering ] I wanna see the fire . Shut up . Hey , moron , what are you doing ? Charlie 's here . You can 't leave . I wanna see Charlie . But we 're not supposed to go . You stay . No one is going to leave this room . - Says who ? - l do . Do you want me to kick your ass ? Because you know I can . I got more strength than you . Stop , stop , stop it ! Get away from me . Why didn 't you stop him ? I tried . It was like there 's nothing there . [ Alarm Continues , Stops ] Shut the door , Martin . Sit down over there . Face the wall . What ? Face the wall . What 's going on ? Shh . Keep quiet . [ Pounds Door ] Vincent . [ Continues Pounding ] Vincent . ! Charlie , look out ! [ Screams ] Hello , Charlie . Let him go . No , I don 't think so . Do it , Charlie . How precise is your weapon , Charlie ? is it as precise as mine ? Fry the son of a bitch ! Oh , she can 't do that , Vincent . She doesn 't want to kill you too . I said , let him go . No . I think you 're going to have to kill me , Charlie . That 's what you want , isn 't it ? - Let him go , please . - Let 's trade . What will you give me ? l-I 'll stay here with you . No , Charlie , don 't- - [ Gasps ] You 'll stay ? Yes . You 're right . I belong here with you . [ Scoffs ] I don 't believe you . Too bad . [ Electricity Arcing ] Well , look who 's here . Charlie , why are you holding back ? [ Vincent ] Get out of here , Charlie . ! After she came all this way to rescue you ? I don 't think so . Or are you afraid of who you really are ? - [ Vincent ] Don 't listen to him , Charlie . ! - I can see it in your face . Let it go , Charlie . Come on , Charlie . Shut up ! Show us what you 're made of . - No ! - [ Groans ] Well , don 't just stand there . [ Gasps , Grunts ] This way . [ Grunts ] [ Yells ] Okay , come on . What is this place ? [ Vincent ] I don 't know . Why do you re-create a town ? Training ? Training for what ? Come on . Wait , wait ! Wait , wait ! Wait ! I mean , you hear about these near-death experiences where the victim recounts ... being compelled towards a light , but then turning back at the last moment . She said she had an out-of-body experience ? That 's what 's different here . She claims she was conscious the whole time . How could she have been pronounced dead ? There 's been cases documented where someone 's buried beneath snow or been underwater ... and had apparently expired- - no discernible pulse , no breathing- - and then spontaneously revived . Spontaneous revival . Kind of like spontaneous combustion , huh ? Have you ever heard of suspended animation ? Yeah , it 's where they freeze people . It 's like a hibernative state . The heart beats so slowly that someone checking for a pulse wouldn 't find one . We 're talking like a single beat in an hour . And there have actually been cases of that , huh ? In textbooks , at least . Hi , Mary . Mary , I 'm Special Agent Pruitt . I 'm with the F.B.l. I understand you believe some people tried to kill you . You have to stop them . Yeah , we will . You don 't worry now . You 're safe . I 'm not worried about me . They think I 'm dead . Who else is in danger , Mary ? You think they 'd tell me ? They 've tried to kill me . They want to keep me quiet . I know things . Who are these people , Mary ? He said his name was Gil James . He 's with Systems Operations . Gil James . The man who tried to kill me ! Rainbird sent him . Rainbird . Lot 6 . I 'm sorry . What ? Lot 6- - drugs , mind-control experiments back in the ' 7 0s . They enhanced our brains . [ Sobbing ] He- - God , Rainbird ! Rainbird was there back then . That means they 're still out there . Mary , Mary , shhh . You 're okay . It 's them ! It 's them ! You 're very safe right now . Mary , tell me how they enhanced your brain . We could do things . What things ? Different things . We were all different . What kind of things could you do , Mary ? - l could make things work . - Like fix things that were broken ? No ! Okay , I don 't understand . Why don 't you show me ? [ Sobbing ] It hurts if I do it . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sure it does . [ Sobbing ] Wait ! Where are you going ? Well , what are you thinking ? What do you think ? I believe she believes it , and in this particular instance , I am willing to keep an open mind . [ Pager Beeping ] [ Grunting ] [ Monitor Beeping ] Do you believe her now ? Clear ! You know , I 've been looking for you . You 're Richardson . Yeah . [ Chuckling ] What ? [ Sighs ] I just cleared the Western Region . [ Charlie ] You said I couldn 't save him . You said I couldn 't save him , and I did . Yes , you did . Damn right . Will you tell us a story ? It doesn 't have to be about Charlie . It could be about something else . No . No stories . Why ? [ Scoffs ] " Why ? " I wanted you to do something for me , a simple thing , and you wouldn 't do it . How do you think that makes me feel ? Are you mad at us ? Mad ? No . I 'm just mad at myself . I realize that I haven 't taught you something ... that 's just as important as tying your shoelaces or riding your bike . I 'm sorry , sir , they told me to come in . I can wait outside . Gil , please , come in . Sit down here . There you are . Go on . We won 't be a minute . We 're just having a lesson . Oh . On second thought , Gil , maybe you can help us . Uh , sure . Why not ? " Why not ? " Gil works for me as an accountant , which means sometimes he has to kill people . Gil was supposed to stop Charlie from going away , but he didn 't . And then when Charlie came back , he missed her the second time . Obviously he 's too big for me to spank , and I can 't ground him . So , anyone , any ideas ? Any ideas ? What am I going to do ? Garcia . Yeah . Grab a clean undershirt . We 're taking a field trip . Where ? Colorado . My victim 's information was right . There is a company called Systems Operations . Three , in fact . There is ? But only the one in Colorado has a John Rainbird and a Gil James . Catch . It 's for your head . Thanks . You okay ? No . Two days ago , my life made sense . It was boring , but it made sense . Now- - - You 're in my world . - Charlie , all those people I found- - all the ones they didn 't even need- - they 're dead because of me . Hey , you didn 't kill them . Yes , I did . 'Cause I did my job- - my stupid little boring job . When I was younger , this is the sort of thing I thought would be so cool- - superheroes , psychic powers and stuff- - but it 's not cool , it 's terrifying . Yeah , it is . We can 't just leave it like this . We 've got to tell somebody . Who do you want to tell ? I don 't know . How about the press ? I tried that . They turned me into a bedtime story to scare children . What about the police ? They own the police . The only reason I keep running is because it 's the only thing that works . You can 't run your whole life . Mmm . Yes , I can . Every time , you know , I see him , it just gets harder and harder . It 's- - What gets harder ? Charlie ? It 's nothing . Why 'd you come back for me ? 'Cause they were gonna kill you . I 'm sorry I dragged you into all of this . You didn 't drag me into this . I was born into this . What did he do to you ? He let them take turns . They were playing . They 're not even kids . They 're like these little monsters . Hey , is that what I am to you ? No . You got away . They didn 't . They 're his . Well , what did you tell him ? Whatever he wanted to hear . It was weird . He wanted to know what you were like , like he was your father or something . He 's not my father . He 's nothing like my father . I didn 't say he was . I didn 't mean it like that . I just don 't get his obsession with you . The world thinks you 're dead , he makes me track you down . Even the way that he looks at you . Yeah , he loves me . Whoa , Charlie , what Rainbird has for you- - that 's not love . That 's something else , something sick . When you love someone , you watch out for them , you care for them . Like you and your father . This has nothing to do with my father . I just don 't understand . Your father 's sick , and you won 't even go see him . I can 't , okay ? Because it hurts ! Why ? Why ? Yeah , love hurts . It 's not just gentle and simple and kind . It hurts . And it 's always the people you love that hurt you the most . Rainbird teach you that ? I just think you should go see your father . Why ? Well , I can 't go see mine . Why do we have to go anyway ? It 's going to be just like we practiced , moron . He 's never been outside . Inside , outside- - what 's the difference ? There 's people . He 's afraid of Charlie . Why ? She didn 't do anything last time . And if she tries anything next time- - Next time ? Did you do that ? - Mm-hmm . - Cut it out . - No . - l mean it . - l know you do . - If you got a problem with me- - Don 't worry . I don 't want you . Do you know what our exposure is on this ? How much money the corporation stands to lose if the Rivermeade test is delayed ? You 're shouting . Of course I 'm shouting ! The past was supposed to be erased , now it 's come back and bitten us in the ass ! We don 't have Richardson . We don 't have McGee . Radiant Thunder 's in six hours , and you- - John , I have tried to work with you on this . I really have . But I am concerned- - and this reflects the feelings of the board as well- - that Charlene McGee may be distracting you from our ultimate goal here . Ah . And what is our ultimate goal , Joel- - ruling the world ? " Ruling the world . " Don 't be absurd , John . Now , owning a substantial piece- - that would be nice . I 'm kidding . I 'm trying to bring a new technology to market , and now I can 't do that . Oh ? Why not ? What if they go to the feds , John ? What if they do ? The federal government is just another potential buyer , isn 't it , hmm ? We have spent substantial resources cleaning up 20 years of mistakes , and now you tell me it just doesn 't matter ? I just wanted to find Charlie . That 's all . Our legal position is more vulnerable now than it was when those test subjects were alive . The government has turned a blind eye before . I should know . And what if they don 't ? What if they don 't ? Do you think that , after this test , the government would really matter ? What if she shows up ? Ah , good afternoon , gentlemen . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting . I keep a very busy schedule . You know what they say about idle hands . You 're John Rainbird ? I am indeed . I 'm Special Agent Pruitt . This is Special Agent Garcia . How do you do ? Hopefully we won 't take up too much of your time . Hopefully not . You ever meet a woman named Mary Conant ? - No , I don 't believe so . What 's all this about ? - Well , she says she knows you . Oh , well , then it 's entirely possible . Twenty years ago , she said , you were involved with something called Lot 6 ... as part of some mind-control experiment . " Mind control " ? Well , that 's preposterous . No , I like to think of our work here ... as a sort of enhancement of human potential . " Enhancement . " Enhancement in what way ? Any way possible . With drugs ? Yes , with drugs if necessary . So you are familiar with something called Lot 6 ? It 's an awful long time ago , but , yes , I do remember Lot 6- - fondly , as a matter of fact . And do you remember Mary Conant ? You know , I 'm beginning to put a face with that name . Yes . Mary Conant . I think I heard she died , didn 't she ? No . No , she 's waiting in the lobby with another one of our agents . My mistake . She said you sent a man named Gil James to kill her . Well , that 's ridiculous . That 's not my department . That 's not your department . We 'd like to see Mr.James right now . Certainly . I 'd be only too happy to take you to him . I believe the last time I saw him he was in the lab . This way . Paul . Yeah ? John needs us . In here , gentlemen . So where 's Mr.James ? Now , let me see . Well , I believe he 's chilling . Oh , dear . You don 't suppose this is a health code violation , do you ? Look , I 'll tell you what . What if we get him out of here before nightfall ? Mr. Rainbird , you 're under arrest . You have the right to remain silent . I appreciate the sentiment , but this is hardly necessary . Well , then , you tell me . What the hell 's going on here ? Radiant Thunder , my friends . Radiant Thunder is what is going on here . And what is Radiant Thunder ? Twenty-five years of hard work , culminating tonight in a town called Rivermeade . What 's going on tonight in Rivermeade ? Glorious destiny . It 's a pity you won 't be there to witness it . - Are you threatening us , Rainbird ? - Oh , he does talk . No , I 'm not threatening you , I 'm just stating the facts . Lower your weapons ! What do you want me to tell them , John ? What ? I was just , uh , wondering what it 's like . What ? Having someone to call . Oh , I don 't even remember . I feel like I 'm looking at this life I could have , and if I look away ... it 's just gonna be gone , he 's gonna be gone . That 's true of all things . Yeah . You don 't have to tell me that . I want to take my life for granted , you know , one day without Rainbird or fire . Can I do that ? No . [ Ringing ] Hello ? [ Vincent ] Henry , it 's me . Where the hell are you ? Are you okay ? Sure , I 'm fine . I 'm great . I 'm scared , Vincent . What did you do ? Nothing . Listen- - " Nothing " ? is that why men broke into my place last night and tried to kill me ? This is about that tape , isn 't it ? Forget about the tape . What do you mean ? It 's best if they think you don 't know anything . Who 's " they " ? What the hell are you talking about ? - Henry , just stop . - Answer my question ! Henry , just stop , okay ? Please ? Okay ? Okay . How 's Mom ? How do you think she is ? And Dad ? He 's not getting better . - When are you gonna see him ? - Tonight . Tell Dad I 'll see him tonight . Don 't say it if you don 't mean it . Henry , I promise . I 'll be there tonight . You 're going away , aren 't you ? Henry- - Thanks . You 're the oracle . Give me something I can use . It doesn 't really work that way . Well , what are we gonna do now ? You wanna hear what you think you 're gonna do , or what you 're really gonna do ? Tell me what I think I 'm gonna do . You think you 're going to Canada , live in a cabin in the mountains where there 's lots of snow . What am I really gonna do ? Do you really want to know ? Yeah . You 're gonna go to Canada . You 're gonna live in a cabin high in the mountains ... where there 's lots of snow . Hey . How 'd it go ? I have to see him . Okay . And then I 'm coming with you . You don 't have to do that . As long as I 'm around , my family 's in danger . Well , as long as you 're around me , then you 're in danger . What- - it gets worse ? I don 't even know where I 'm going . So ? Look , we can go see him , then we can go to Canada or something . If you want to run , you must do it now . Forget about your father , forget about Rainbird . Can you do that ? Will you take us to the hospital ? I always do . Miss Conant ? Mary ? Mary . Mary ? Damn it ! Miss Conant ! I thought you were coming back to the lobby . What is taking them so long ? I can identify those people ! Just let us do our jobs . I 'm sure they 've got it under control . - There they are . - John . That 's him . That 's Rainbird . Thank you so much . A pleasure meeting you . They 're letting him go ! No ! Mary , relax ! Okay ? Just wait here . Pruitt ! What 's going on ? " What 's going on ? " Nothing 's going on . These guys make titanium ski bindings . It 's a nothing , man , a zero . We 're on a big wild-goose chase . - She says that 's the guy . - Then she 's mistaken . No , you bastard ! Not after all this ! Hey ! Rainbird ! - Mary ! No , Mary ! Mary ! Mary ! - Rainbird . ! Mary . Mary ? Mary ? Mary . Mary ! Destiny . Why are we stopping ? Oh , no . What is it ? It 's the town . It 's the same as the warehouse . [ Vincent ] Why did you bring us here ? [ Richardson ] Because this is where it all ends . Vincent . Hello , Charlie . Welcome to Rivermeade . They picked me up just before you . Why are you doing this ? [ Rainbird ] Of all the test subjects , that you survived this long amazes me . I thought you would have hanged yourself years ago . I know how I die . Oh , yes , well , I know how you die too . Must be a terrible thing , to know everything ... and not to be able to change a thing . You must be a very frustrated man . It has its moments . Yes , I suppose . Not much of a precognitive , though , are you , if you didn 't know Gil was coming . I knew he was coming . But I haven 't seen you in so long , I thought I 'd d check in , see how you 're doing . But I thought you already knew everything . I do- - every damn thing . Well , so , then you know how I 'm doing . You know what I want , and you know what I 'll give you . What you want , I can 't give you , and what you 'll give me isn 't worth a cup of spit . Well , I thought you might be partial to it . There 's nothing you can do to me that you haven 't already done . You know , back in the French Revolution , beggars would do almost anything to get noticed . I mean , they 'd cut off their own fingers , even a foot . But the crowds were so jaded , they didn 't even notice . So the enterprising beggar would go to a butcher ... or find a cousin with a sharp knife , fix him up real good . The first cut starts at the left corner of the mouth ... and extends to the lobe of the nearest ear . The same on the other side . And then the lips are removed ... so everyone can see that big , big smile of yours . And last , the nose , turning what 's left of that face into a skull . Except , of course , you 're still alive . Well , that 's fascinating . It really is . Reminds me of this drug test some 20 years ago . Maybe you heard of it : Lot 6 . Everyone who took it- - turned ' em into a freak . But you know who it messed with most ? Who ? You . Me ? All that talk about God , and all you had to do was take the drug , but you didn 't . And you know why ? Because you 're scared . You won 't . Now , why wouldn 't I ? Because I 'm the one that gives you Charlie McGee . You 'll bring her here to me ? Not because you want me to , and not because you won 't kill me . But because- - l know , I know . Because you don 't have a choice . He didn 't give me anything . But you helped me save Vincent . All I did was drop you off . Before I could drive away , you came running out the back . Wait . ! Wait , wait . ! Oh , hell . But you knew my parents , and you were there with them . And I trusted you . I didn 't ask you to . Everything that you said was a lie . I never lie . I did know your parents , I can see the future , and this is what has to happen . - No , you are making this happen . - I 'm going now . We won 't be seeing each other again . You sound so sure . You 're getting everything you 've always wanted . I feel sorry for you . you don 't have to do this . you can still help us . This is what has to happen . I 'm so sorry , Charlie . Vincent , come on . [ Horn Honks ] Charlie , you said they 'd built a town for training . Training for what ? I don 't know . How should I know ? We have to get out of here . Charlie , this town 's wired . [ Charlie ] There . There . As of today , the gun and the bomb are obsolete . Welcome to warfare in the 21 st century . We own it . What we 'll see tonight is a coordinated attack ... on a single hardened structure- - in this case , a bank . Any other weapons system would result in unacceptable civilian casualties . Our operatives will achieve their goal with no collateral damage ... and complete deniability . Excuse me a moment . There 's a matter that requires my immediate attention . Door , please . Come on , Charlie , let 's go . What the hell is she doing here ? Richardson brought her , just like I told him to . This doesn 't make any sense- - all this for a bank . There 's a police officer . Vincent , wait , no- - Officer ! Officer . [ Panting ] The bank 's about to be robbed . You should call for backup or something . - You see these kids ? - yeah . They 're about to take down the bank . All of ' em ? Look , I know it sounds crazy , but you gotta believe me . Come on , Vincent . I 'm telling you the truth ! I know it sounds crazy- - He can 't believe you . How could you bring her here ? Do you want this test to fail ? You seem upset . Do you know who 's in that room ? The board of directors , waiting for something to happen . If it doesn 't , I 'm going to have to tell them that you 've blown the test . Oh , something will happen . He closed the bank . The bank is closed ! Forget about the bank . Damn it , the bank is the test . Joel , even you could rob that bank . Charlie is the test . She 's always been the test . No . No . You insisted on that bank . You said the bank would demonstrate crowd control ... and teamwork and all that crap . [ Chuckling ] The board of directors is- - " More than I , if truth were told , " have stood and sweated , hot and cold . And through their reigns in ice and fire , fear contended with desire . Agued once like me were they , I , like them , shall win my way . Lastly , to the bed of mold , where there 's neither heat nor cold . But from my grave across my brow , plays no wind of healing now . And fire and ice within me fight , beneath the suffocating night . ' I don 't understand . They 're not doing anything . What are they waiting for ? Me . What ? They 're waiting for me . Why are you doing this ? For you , of course . I want to set you free . You 're going to hurt all these people . Hurt them ? No . I 'm going to kill them . But you can stop me . N-No . No . Charlie ? Charlie , where 're you going ? I have to get out of here . You have to do something . What do you want me to do , Vincent ? Burn down the town ? 'Cause that 's what 's gonna happen . Hey . Are you lost ? Where 's your parents ? Well , what do you say we come over here and sit down , and I 'll go look for ' em , all right ? Now , don 't move . You can 't go . You 're the only one who can stop them . But I won 't stop . Don 't you see ? It 's what he wants . Then I 've got to do something . I have to try . Vincent- - You 're talking about a massacre . Yes ! Something to make the world sit up and pay attention . Cody will absorb all of Charlie 's power . And then what ? Joel , do you believe in transubstantiation- - where man can become God ? You 're nuts . I 'm pulling the plug . Oh , it 's too late to develop a conscience , Joel . Who said anything about a conscience ? This is self-preservation . It 's too late for that too . [ Screaming ] [ All Clamoring , Shouting ] [ Horn Honking ] You 're blind . Now walk . Hey , what 's up , man ? Where are you going ? [ Horn Honking ] [ Screaming ] Look out ! [ Grunts ] [ Cop ] Folks , let 's move ! Get outta here ! Move , people ! You can 't stand . Come on , son . Come with me . [ Moaning ] [ Screaming ] Emily . ! Emi- - [ Screams ] Wanna see your spleen ? 'Cause I can show it to you . - No ! - No ! Let go ! Put me down ! No ! You gotta stop ! You 're killing them ! I don 't care ! John 's still alive . you know what you have to do , right ? You have to go back . you have to go back . Let him go . Now , you pick up that piece of glass , hold it to your throat . That 's enough . I know you think that Rainbird is your friend , but he 's not . He lies . He hurt me , and he 'll hurt you . - No , he won 't . - He 's hurting you right now . Every time you use your powers , you become less human , and he knows it . - You 're lying . She 's lying ! - No ! Ask him. ls she lying ? No . - l tried . - You did the right thing , and I don 't want to run away anymore . The rules haven 't changed , Charlie . you know what you have to do . Don 't listen to him , Charlie . You can taste it , can 't you- - like sulphur on your tongue . You don 't know what you 're asking . It 's what you are , isn 't it , Charlie ? It 's what you 've always been . Just let it happen . It 's not like I 'm giving you a choice . No . ! [ Sobbing ] No-no-no-no-no ! [ Gurgling ] Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh . Char- - Charlie . [ Screaming ] yes. yes . ! That 's my girl . All my life I 've been looking for God . You want a God to forgive you ? No , for a God to damn me . The closest I 've ever come , Charlie , is in your eyes . Look closer . [ Muffled Screaming ] You know what I can do . You have no idea what I can do . Yes , I do , and I want it . You don 't want this . I want everything . More ! Give me everything ! [ Cody Gasping ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Henry ] I think I was in the third grade , and there was this kid who used to beat me up , and Vincent made him stop because it was his job to beat me up . And the time Vincent tried to sell you to the neighbors ? [ Laughing ] I guess they didn 't offer enough . I guess not . Can I help you ? I 'm a friend of Vincent 's . My name is Charlie McGee . I came to tell you how sorry I am ... and that you should know that Vincent was going to come and see you . But he didn 't . But he was going to . Well , that 's all I really came to say . Excuse me , Charlie . How did you know my son ? Well , he helped me out a lot . He sort of helped me trust people again , I guess . You should be really proud of him . Thank you for coming . [ P.A.

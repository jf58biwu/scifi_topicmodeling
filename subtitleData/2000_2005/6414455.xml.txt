 What attacked Talyn was a retrieval squad . Aeryn , my name is Xhalax Sun . You were conceived in love . The squad is under the command of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun . My mother . My superior officers knew I visited you that night . They gave me a chance to redeem myself by killing your father . We let her live , she comes , she hunts us down again . Aeryn , you should not be the one to do this . We must not let Xhalax live . Crichton : You want her dead , you do it . Crais : As you wish . Go ! Go now ! You must not witness this . No ! ( gunfire ) What is the matter ? Radiation . Massive radiation . I couldn 't stop it . Don 't worry about me . I 've never felt better . And now , on Farscape ... ( all mumbling ) I talk to the dead . I can help find the dead one you seek . Pay me . Pay me , and I can help ... ( gasping ) ( whispering voice ) : Aeryn ... Crais : It 's your fault Aeryn 's down on Valldon ! Not my fault ! Trying to help ! Trying to help ? ! She 's in mourning for Crichton ! How are you helping by filling her head with crazy tales about spirit channelers ? It 's not crazy . She wanted to get away from you . She sees you following her . I 'm following her ? You 're the one that 's following her ! Me ? Aeryn wants me around . She wants me to watch over her . Sh-She wants me to protect her from people like you ! You stupid , selfish nak-noks ! Aeryn has made it clear she wants nothing to do with any of us . She wants no part of your plan to find Moya and ... Can 't leave her on Valldon . It 's dangerous . It 's filled with mystics and criminals . Then it 's just like here . You 're a mystic , and we 're criminals , but Aeryn doesn 't want to be here . You don 't understand . - I ... What is it we don 't understand , slave ? She ... she 's going to talk to Crichton . Male : Is it you ? Yes , it 's Aeryn Sun . I have changed my mind . I want you to raise that man . Which one do you seek ? Talyn Lyczak , my father . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Do you remember ? Ah ... ( snickers ) Who the frell are you ? I remember it all now . What are you talking about ? Touch me . Don 't be afraid , girl . I ... I ain 't going to bite . Touch me . Remember it all . I was a pilot , Aeryn . Astronaut . I was what I wanted to be . It 's all there . ( groans ) - You all right ? Yes , I 'm fine , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It 's just the same old pain . Same pain . ( gasps ) It 's just the same old pain . Same pain . Oh , I got it . I got your locket . Whose , uh , image you got in here anyway ? You know who 's in there . ( knocking ) Are you Aeryn Sun ? I heard you talking to somebody . I thought you were alone . I am . Now , you knew I came here searching for someone else , but ... let 's do it . Do what ? You found me . You told me that you could contact my dead father . So show me . You don 't believe I can reach him ? Look , you 're here , I 'm willing to pay and that is all that should concern you . Will you show me your face ? If I may ask , what business have you with Talyn Lyczak ? I was his daughter . ( grunts ) So , can you contact him ? I can do more than that . I am Talyn Lyczak . Man : The world is full of demons ! Rygel : Get away ! Get back ! Zhaan : Stark . Rygel , Rygel ! - Stark . There ... - What ? Do you see Aeryn ? - Stark . No . For a moment , I thought I heard Zhaan 's voice . Oh , frelling brasma , tell me you 're joking , right ? No . No . - Stark ... . Crais ... Crais ! Yes , Rygel . Have you located Aeryn 's signal yet ? No . She 's masked it . We 've been all over this stinking city . Now we 're in some kind of nakky hotel . ( growling ) Stark 's meeting every cousin and furbot he ever knew . It 's a planet of Starks down here ! You 're exaggerating . There ! There it is again ! Zhaan 's voice ! Crais , get down here ! I can 't stand it alone with him . No , no , no , stay with him until you find Aeryn . Zhaan ( whispering ) : Stark . Call me when you do . Crais ? Crais ! ( gasps ) - I talk to the dead . I-I see ... Oh , stop . Just stop . That blood 's so fake , it 's laughable . ( mocking laughter ) ( whispering ) : Kellor . Kellor ... she misses you . Kellor ? She forgives you . She knows that you couldn 't go against your parents . How do you know her name ? She knows that a Dominar cannot just ... No ! Get away from me ! - Wait ! But I know more ... No ! - secrets . Secrets she didn 't want me to tell you . Pay me , I can tell you . Did you tell them about me ? Rygel , did you get touched ? I 'll touch you if you keep telling these fekiks about me ! But I didn 't . I warned you that this planet had dark powers . You 're full of yotz ! This whole place is full of yotz . Rygel , you must guard your spirit . Now follow me . I was told that the owner of this hotel may know where Aeryn is . ( people grunting , muttering ) Oh ! Back ! Back ! Lyczak : I had my face altered , so I could hide . Do you know what this is ? Early Peacekeeper standard blood spectrometer . Fairly primitive , yes . But accurate , to near 100 % certainty . ( whirring ) ( whirring ) Compare the spectrographs . Take a hundred of mine , and they will all match . Aeryn ... I ... I understand . This is not what you want . Goodbye , Aeryn . Wait . Stark : Hello ? Is anyone here ? Owner : I wouldn 't do that ! Back away slowly . Very slowly . Lucky I saw you through the peephole and was quick enough to deactivate it . Deactivate what ? There 's nothing I can ... ( metal whining ) Protection and mutilation combined . Much more effective than an attack animal . Are you here to buy dead bodies ? You 've gotta outbid him . He buys all his from me . Buys ' em fresh . Rygel : We are not here for bodies . We are here to find a Sebacean . Stark : Named Aeryn Sun . She 's very beautiful . Hair as dark as a fellip berry . Shut up , Stark . Stark : She usually wears it tight , pulled back . But recently , she 's taken to wearing it out , down to her shoulders . We 're close , very close . They 're not close at all . He 's some kind of weird probakto and she can 't stand the smell of ... ( groaning ) That 's not true . It 's more than true . But we are trying to find her so we can get out of this nak house . Hmm , no Sebaceans here anymore . You might try the Stallic Hotel on the far side of the city . I hear they stay there . " Far side of the city " ? ! I 'm not traveling tonight . How much for your finest room ? - Zhaan ( whispering ) : Stark ... Finest room ? Where do you think you are ? This is a refugee city ... Zhaan ( whispering ) : Stark ... and you 've got to fight for tent space . ( rattling ) - Get away ! Look at my foyer . Infested with kratada . Frell off ! By the goddess , Rygel ... What is it ? Better not be Zhaan again . Don 't let her see us . Don 't let her see us . Oh , don 't let her see us . - Banik , let go of me . Shut up ! It can 't be her . It can 't be . Who ? Aeryn ? No , no , no , no , no . ( gasping ) Is that ... Aeryn 's mother ? I told you to leave them alone . I did . I did . You were talking to that slug . Were you telling them about me ? - No , no , no . I paid you a lot of money . I paid all of you a lot of money . I would never betray you , Xhalax . I never would . Not anymore . ( groaning ) ( gasping ) : Frell ! ( groans ) Xhalax : Get rid of the body . By the goddess . Crichton was right . You never killed Xhalax ! Get them off me ! Let me up . The only time we 're letting you up is when we flush you out the airlock . What happened to Xhalax ? Tell us ! Let me up ! Tell us . You tell us ! When you left me to kill Xhalax , I saw instantly the end . For you . - For all of us . I knew that if I killed her , High Command would send another Retrieval Squad after us . And if they failed , another and another . You made a deal to save us all . I offered Xhalax her life . And what did you get in return ? She would inform High Command that we were all dead . Do I look like an idiot ? Huh ? Huh ? Does he look like an idiot ? Do I look like an idiot ? Yeah . Well , I 'm not . And we 're not fooled by you . If you 've got a deity , you better make your peace with it now , because I 'm going to lead you to the other side real quick . No . No ? What , no ? Rygel understands our predicament . Talyn has part of my psyche . Can you fly him ? No , but Aeryn can . And she 's not here . ( giggles ) Why did you come to this planet ? You said at first it was not to contact me . Who were you seeking ? I lost someone . He died . Were you in love with him ? Aeryn , on this planet , I have seen things I never dreamed possible . At the fall of the moon , I will come back with a being who might be able to help contact the one you loved . Wait for me , please . I want to try to do this for you . Here . Have you seen him before ? Yes , I 've seen him . Well , do you know who he is ? No one . Just ... I hear he had been studying with the nelliks who channel the dead . Do you know where he 's from ? No . Ugh ! I just heard he 's been hiding on Valldon for a few cycles , but everyone 's hiding , so ... Was he a Peacekeeper ? I don 't know . Oh ! Someone could use some fellip nectar . You know where to get it . What a good idea . ( laughs ) How can no one have seen Aeryn ? They have . They 're just not talking . Wait . I 've got an idea . Stark , what are you doing ? Leave her alone and let her die in peace . Oh yotz , here we go again . Get these off me . ( laughs ) You 're not a child like he is . How can I help you if I 'm cuffed ? Oh , you 'll help . If someone starts shooting , you 'll make a very good shield . ( Rygel chuckles ) She thinks Aeryn may be here on one of the upper levels . Right . I 'll go . I 'll stay calm . I 'll take this fekik with me . You can tell Aeryn what he did . You keep an eye out for Xhalax . Oh , not now . Get away ! ( roaring ) Right here . - This had better not be the wrong room . It won 't be . Aeryn ? Are you in there ? Aeryn , are you all right ? You look terrible . What have you been doing ? Have you ... This is serious . We need to talk . Can I come in ? No . - Alright , that does it . Get down , on your knees , face the wall . I am not getting on my knees ! Get down ! - You told Rygel you 'd be calm . I am calm ! You get down now ! Aeryn , you must return to Talyn . We ... We saw Xhalax here on Valldon . It 's this place . You should see who I 've seen . No , no , your mother is really , really here . I know . Guess who 've I 've seen ? Crichton . And guess who else ? My father . Any microt now , Stark , you 're going to see Zhaan . You stop . You listen to me . He ... he never killed Xhalax . He was preparing to betray us . That is not true . I made a deal for all of us . Liar ! Liar ! Now , you must come back with us . I will look after you . I want to look after you . That would be really nice . Oh . Please . - Don 't touch me . Crais : Aeryn , Xhalax is alive . ( laughs ) Come on . Come on . Come on , Crais . You can tell the truth . Hmm ? You get up . Get away from him . No , that 's all right . He wants me . Isn 't that right ? You always wanted to take me from Crichton and now here 's your chance . ( whispering ) : I do not want Bialar . If I squeeze my eyes closed tightly enough , you could be someone else . ( grunting ) No , come on . Right here . Right now . Give it to me . Give me what you 've got . You 're coming with me . I 'm taking now . Don 't you touch me ! Or I swear ... I will spear the last eye you have left . Do you know what makes you so much worse ? Is the fact that you think you 're so much better than him . Always pressing against me . Stealing looks . Get out of here . Both of you . Get out ! Uh , excuse me , have you seen a cripple who was bleeding from the eyes ? He knew about a certain female I ... Ta-nak-nee ! Nee-nak-nak ! Ra ! Well , don 't get excited . Wah ! - I just , uh ... Peasant ! Watch out . Hmm , watch your step . - Move . Pushy , pushy ! Do you know who that was ? That slug was with Aeryn . He was trying to save her . How 'd it go ? Oh , I think Aeryn 's buying it all . When she sees this bastard , she 'll suffer the way you want her to . ( groaning ) Oh , someone 's getting restless . I better get up there . You 're all set ? Under here , solid krank . Don 't miss . I won 't . First Talyn , then Xhalax . What next ? ( wind blowing ) ( shouting ) : Crichton ! Crichton ! Crichton ! ( thunder rumbling ) Crichton : That 's it . Earth . Minus the sunshine . This is my world now . Think I liked yours better . ( grunting ) Let me guess . You 're my long lost sister . Look , Aeryn , I know you 're upset . I , too , had someone important in my life . Kellor was her name . I missed her for a long time . But I knew , as I 'm sure you do , that self-sacrifice is not the answer . Look , I 'm not like Crais or Stark . I 'm not trying to save you or recreate with you . You can do whatever you like , but Crichton loved you , Aeryn . He wouldn 't want his death to lead you here . ( wind gusts ) Oh , ah ! Oh ! Oh ! Please , could we go inside ? This height ... You 're not going in there . - Huh ? ( knocking ) You have to go now . I should also tell you , Crais and Stark weren 't lying . Xhalax is on this planet . And I wasn 't lying , either . My father 's here , too . Crazy place , Ryg . Now , go . But , uh ... Go ! I 've brought the Seer . Seer Cresus , the one we seek is not long dead . His name is John Crichton and he 's from a race called Human . Come here . Closer . I won 't bite ... much . ( laughs ) Trust him . Don 't be afraid . Seer Cresus : Touch me . I must feel you ... to reach him . ( panting ) Soft . Touch me ... soft . Tell me about this Crichton . Uh ... he ... Did he love you ? Hold you ? Touch you ... soft ? Yes , he loved me . He was very ... he made me better . ( gagging ) Aeryn ? Help me . Bring me back . ( gasps ) ( sighs ) ( gagging continues ) Cresus , are you all right ? ( speaking in alien language ) Cresus says he has rarely had a vision so powerful and he wants me to find the Sintar . He is a creature who can ... sometimes turn spirits corporeal . That 's not possible . Oh , Aeryn ! On this planet , I have seen things I have not thought possible . Wait here . I will find the Sintar . If the connection is strong enough , if he thinks this can happen ... He can bring Crichton back ? Perhaps . Don 't lose hope . Not ... yet . Wait here . I will not be long . Just believe . I returned from the dead . Why can 't he ? ( sighs ) Crichton : This is where it hurts . Yeah . Right here . ( sighs ) You can 't bring me back , you know . Mmm , they said that on this planet there 's a ... I 've forgotten his name . No . No ? No . ( sighs ) Was it easy to be a hero ? Leave me behind ? You never think you 're going to die . I didn 't know . You ... you did . No . - Yes . You did . No . ( sighs ) Hello , soldier . What 's the matter ? Surprised to see your old mum ? This isn 't quite the family reunion you 'd imagined . Sit down . Soldier without her weapon . That 's against regulations . My leg , huh ? After you left me on that planet , it got infected . And I had to amputate it myself . Now , that ... that hurt . You thought you could get it all . Get away . Be safe . Xhalax ? Hello , dear . No ! Don 't ! You 've only just met , and already you 're trying to protect your father . Xhalax , stop ! Twenty cycles ago , we made a pact to survive for ... for our daughter . You couldn 't hurt her then . You couldn 't hurt me . I can hurt you now , old man . So get ready to die . Remember when Aeryn was born ? I snuck into the med-chamber . You had just woken ... - Lie down . Aeryn : Listen , he 's not the one that you ... - Shut up . Just leave him alone ! - Shut up ! Oh , go on , shoot me . I 'm not scared of you . Shoot me and leave Aeryn alone . You know , I think I 've changed my mind . You 're too ugly to kill . Looking at that face . Now , lie down . Lie down and roll over . Xhalax , wh-what are you ... Turn around , now . Xhalax , just stop ... - Shut up ! Lie down ! Aeryn : Just leave him alone ! - Roll over ! No , no . - Xhalax , don 't . Roll over ! ( groans weakly ) So . So now it 's just you and me . You know , things couldn 't have worked out better . I 'm glad you two got to meet . Why ? For this . For you to suffer . For everything you did . For everything that went wrong . I ... we did nothing to you . You did everything . After your birth , High Command said I could redeem myself if ... But they lied . The damage was done . And no matter what I did , I was never truly reinstated . And now you want my pity ? Oh no , I want your pain . To know how close I was to love . So close ... and then to lose it all in an instant . I 've heard ... loved ones leave you in pieces . That little by little , you start to forget things about them . But that 's not true . You lose them ... everything , instantly . And suddenly nothing can replace them . Nothing . And now you have nothing . How does it feel ? Stark : You lied to us , said Aeryn wasn 't here ! No , no , I ... I didn 't lie . Did Xhalax pay you to keep us away ? Who ? I 've never heard of them . Now , tell me again , how do you activate this Security Grill ? Do I just push this ? - No , no , no , don 't touch that ! Why ? Will those speary things shoot up ... Look , look ! I had to lie to you . If I 'd helped you before , that maniac upstairs would have killed me . Rygel : Go on . There is a service lift . Xhalax doesn 't know about it . One of you could go up in that . Surprise her . Uh , Stark ... What ? Who are they ? ( gunfire ) Down ! Crais : Uncuff me ! Uncuff me ! Under the circumstances ... uncuff him ! Wasn 't killing Talyn once enough ? But did you have to kill him in front of me ? Is that what was missing ? When I first met him , I knew he wasn 't my father . But he knew all these details about you and me . You 're lying . You didn 't know . ( chuckles ) Of course , I hoped that he might be Talyn ... Just as I 'd hoped that I might see Crichton again . But in my heart I knew that that was not my father . And then you walked in . You know , we Peacekeepers think that we are so remarkable . Soldiers without equal . Precise tacticians , pure bloods . But I 've realized that we 're not remarkable . We do nothing for love . Not one thing . You 're wrong . Cycles ago , after your birth , I was given an order . They called it a choice . One of you must die , they said . I killed your father so you could live . I did that for love . Zhaan ( whispering ) : Stark ... It 's here again ! - Stark ... It 's Zhaan 's voice . Can you hear it ? Not now , Stark . Stark , get down ! - Save Aeryn ! I 'll hold them off here . Go ! Go ! ( gunfire ) So , this is it . Kill me now . Destroy the last piece of your life , and leave nothing . I wasn 't an assassin until I killed your father . I was a pilot . I was bred to be a pilot . But they made me kill again and again . And finally I stopped caring . But I knew your suffering would ease my pain . And it has . It has . The battle 's over , Xhalax . You don 't want to kill me . No ? ( gunfire ) Why don 't you come out here a bit closer ? It might make it easier for you . Here . You can 't miss from here . Unless you want to . ( gunfire ) Drop the gun , Xhalax . ( crashing ) Aeryn ! No ! ( screams ) No ! Let me fall , Aeryn . No . Do it . ( gasping ) Let me go . ( grunting ) I died a long time ago . You live for me . Zhaan 's voice keeps getting stronger . I know she 's trying to reach me and I must discover what it is she needs to communicate . Please do not waste time trying to look for me . It is vital you take what I have left you to the Crichton on Moya . He , and only he , will know what to do with it . Goodbye , my friends . Take care of Aeryn . I will find you again . Crais , why would Stark leave this ? What do you think the other Crichton wants with it ? I have no idea . Talyn believes he 's located Moya . His long-range scans have detected Leviathan transmissions from the Manin Nebula . Well , let 's try to find them . It 'll be good to get back to Moya . Perhaps . ( sighs ) As soon as our ships are reunited and ... Talyn can find someone other than me to pilot him , I should leave . I , uh , hope Moya 's done better than we have . Is Aeryn on her way up ? She 'll be leaving Valldon within the arn . Maybe ... I could have become something different . If you had lived , I could have truly changed . But you are gone . And I am ... what I was bred to be . Aeryn . Come here . No . You have to go now . Seer Cresus : Wait . Most of the time , Aeryn , what we do is a distortion , a hoax . But with you , Aeryn Sun , it may have been real . Shall we try ... one more time ?

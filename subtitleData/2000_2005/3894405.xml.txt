 Previously on the Lost World ... John , I 'm going home . Ned Malone , the Challenger 's expedition . - Are you the pilot ? - Not , anymore . You did kill your crew . For all the good it did me ? Stay away from me . Ah ! The ship won 't let me go . Until you and your friends take my place . Challenger it is a ghost ship . I 've been trapped aboard this ship since my last mission , May 26 , 1915 . Where have you been ? On this airship terrible storm crashing into the ocean . Then you reappear here so the nightmare can begin again . No ! Marguerite , no ! We are falling too quickly ... We are heading for the cliff . It 's been one hell of a ride George . Challenger , what is that ? I beat you , you bloody ship . I beat you all ! No , you can 't be here . NO ! Where are my friends ? At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World . Are we dead , yet ? If we are , I 'm glad we ended up in the same place . - Glad or surprised ? - Where is Veronica ? And what has happened to my clothes ? That strange light that touched us just before we died . whatever it was I looked over at Veronica and the light ... well it didn 't seem to touched her , it just ... - So she survived the crash , and I didn 't - I could assure you Marguerite ... we are the furthest thing from being dead ... I don 't know about you but I 've got a pain in my back ... and a blister on my right heel and I am famish now these are all symptoms ... of being very much alive . Oh this is extraordinary ... all the windows are fully restored ... every piece of equipment . Oh this is remarkable ... magnificent ... - Where the hell are we ? - Well eh ... We are in a airship hangar . - How can that be ? - We were heading for the cliffs ... And the instant the ship hit the cliffs ... time reseated itself . Bringing us and the ship back to the beginning of his final flight . Just the same it 's done for Askwith all this years . Any idea what might be out there ? With everything else it 's happened there can only be ... one thing beyond this door . It 's a bloody air-station . It 's Pulham station to be precise . What the one in South Norfolk ? We are back in England ? Well that 's one way of look at it . By God this is Pulham . - Challenger how did you know that ? - It was in Askwith 's logbook . His airship flew his final mission out of this base . But Askwith said he flew that mission years ago . Precisely seven years ago . Wednesday may 26 , 1915 . Then Veronica was right . Askwith 's airship is like the Flying Dutchman . And since he 's tricked us into taken the place of his crew ... he 's trapped us here . So it seems . Well if we are here and Askwith is not in the realm ... are you suggesting he is back in the real world ? Free on the plateau . That if he survived the fall with Malone . There was only one parachute the only way Askwith could survive was if ... Poor Malone . What about Veronica ? She didn 't fall out of the ship . So why isn 't she here with us ? What could happen to her ? Where are my friends ? What did you do to them ? They are on the airship ... - lost for eternity . - I don 't believe you . - Where 's Malone ? Where is he ? - He is dead . There was only one parachute . I took that from you for a reason . Last time you have it you plunged it through my heart . This time I leave it there . - There is no need for this . - You murdered my friends . They are not dead , they are ... on that ship in another reality . That 's no good enough . Veronica , you can 't know what it 's like to be alone so long . The hell I don 't ! Oh Oh . Not even you can stop me now . No ! no , it can 't be . What happen to me ? It 's the ship , you belong to the ship now , it 's in you here . Your ship sent me back to you . To get you back to it somehow . I wouldn 't come back . Do you hear me ? Seven years it 's long enough you can have me anymore . Oh yes , it can . And if you can go back that means I can still save my friends . The captain of the Flying Dutchman had three days to scape his curse . The day you arrived , the day we took off ... so today is day three . - Today you go back . - Enough . I 'll find you , no matter where you hide , and I 'll find a way to get you back on that ship ! I say we forget about the airship . Let 's start one of those lorries outside and drive back to London . That 's an intriguing idea Marguerite that we get us back let 's see ... five years before we left . Which means we can look ourselves out ... and warn ourselves not to go on Challenger 's expedition ... in the first place . As much as I would like to put that paradox to the test ... this is not the real Pulham ... and trying to leave this base by any means other than by the airship ... it 's going to be more difficult than trying to get out the plateau . There must be some way out off here I mean where is everybody else ? Marguerite I will explain it one more time . No , please don 't my headache is bad enough as it is . Look the reason there is no other people here is because the time . So , you finally seem fit to grace us with your presence . Do you know who we are ? Let 's see Pinsly , Reburn ... and acting A-mechanic Hides . His majesty 's special aircrew number one ... under the command of Captain Mark Askwith . Corpo Pinsly ... Would you care to share the joke A-mechanic ? - Eh , no . - Please , forgive us . We are just trying to understand . You think we are Royal Navy personal . Reburn , Hides and Pinsly . No , I think you are the blessed Prince of Wales , now where is your captain ? The captain is been detained sir . Detained is it ? and what 's her name this week ? Oh you know the good captain . I know his kind . And as far as I can see you are no different . Your briefing is in one hour , so for goodness sake be on time . Briefing ? The " First Lord of the Admiralty " doesn 't like to be kept waiting . You can 't hide from me Askwith . I was born in the jungle . Not today boys , time to go . You see that Askwith . You are next . All things considered this is going much better than I 've expected . Better than what , George ? we 've replaced Askwith crew . - We are reliving their last day . - A day which ends with a big explosion . Not , necessarily . Now you 've really lost me . I believe our presence here has broken the ... pattern of Askwith 's loop of repeating time . We are a new crew . There are only 3 of us as oppose to Askwith 's original 4 . So we 've already ... created considerable change to the events of the past . Which means those events might no have to turn out the same way . - Exactly . - Attention ! The First Lord of the Admiralty . If was 1915 then The First Lord of the ... Oh my God ! It 's Winston bloody Churchill ! That 's right . have to keep everything the ship safe . You don 't know what are you doing . I know enough to send you back where you belong . You don 't understand . I 'm free now , it 's you the ship 's wants . What I should believe anything you have to say ? Because I tried everything . I fired my gun into the ship hydrogen bags ... I died in the blast I jumped over board again and again ... with or without a parachute ... It 's never let me go . It 's like some damn magnet Veronica always drawing you back . - That 's the curse . - You had 7 years to figure it out . And you still haven 't . Your ship 's not cursed Askwith , you are . You killed your crew , you 're being punished , not me . Nice try , did they teach you that in the Royal Navy Service ? Your mission today is one of this absolutely vital ... to his majesty 's war efforts yet must remain ... absolutely secret . Thus the extraordinary measures that 've been taken to ... clear the space so that no one ... except for those present knows your destination . Lord Churchill . You are charge with protecting this convoy of ships ... from America bringing grain and another vital food stuff through the blockade . Grain ? try guns and ammunition ... A-mechanic Hide ... - Do you have a question ? - No , Wi ... Lord Churchill , I mean . - Have we met ? - In a way . No , not yet . Captain Marchbanks the map , if you please . Have you met Churchill ? I believe you find this ... Well , I will in about two years from now . Just trying to remember something about Winnie in May 26 , 1915 . - Winnie ? - To continue . By sunset today , the American convoy ... of grain ... will have reach at these coordinates . That exactly where Askwith encounter the storm ... that brought him to the plateau . Oh we 're in good shape . Am I right in thinking this rufians intent to diner upon us ? That 's the general idea . I trust you have some clever trick for escaping this type of situation . Sorry , fresh out . - This is distressing . - Why ? You said as long as we belong to your ship . - They can 't kill us . - Not in the sense that you mean . But if these cannibals should chop us or a dinosaur ... gulped us down we just end up back on the airship , The whole nightmare begin again . I believe they are finalizing their menu looks like you are the appetizer ... It doesn 't change anything , Veronica . We are still going to spend an eternity together on my ship . I hope you die of food poisoning . Where are we ? Veronica . If you are smart you do as I do run and hide before the ship finds you . Royal Navy tea just as awful as I remembered . You really thing we find the storm here . No , I 'm certain of it , and I just as certain it would return us to the plateau . Please . Care to share the joke , acting A-mechanic ? We spent two years trying to get off the plateau ... and now that we are finally off ... All we think about is going back . Your captain is nowhere on the station . I ... trust you 'll assure Lord Churchill that we are more than ... capable of carrying out the mission on our own ... an engineer , a navigator and a female A-mechanic ... Is it something missing from the mix ? Say a pilot ? Oh we 'd flown in enough mission with captain Askwith ... to know we can handle the airship ... Well , that that changes things ... Considering that for secrecy 's sake ... you sure were chosen from separate crews ... to ensure that you have never served together ... Seems or security measures need improvement this mission is at risk ... I 'm informing Lord Churchill that we 'll be deploying his majesty 's special aircrew number 2 ... A backup crew ? - No , you can 't . - Challenger . Perhaps it 's time to be telling the truth . Roxton , trust me , that always causes more trouble than it solves ... Challenger , Roxton , how are you people ? May I suggest a more direct strategy ? Let 's get to the airship before the backup crew does . Wait ! We need the navigation maps . No one of you move . I know how this looks . But we can explain . What ? That you are who you say you are . That you possibly killed your own captain . Actually , no our captain killed us . Stay out woman . The day they put your sex in uniform it was a dark day for the empire . You ! - Marguerite ! - Stay where you are . Unless you want to be next John . If you haven 't notice I 'm the one with the weapon . Nothing will save you from me ! Roxton , this isn 't real . - None of it . - Marguerite 's dead , Challenger ! We 've changed the patterns of events ! You said it yourself ! You are as mad as March hares ' . Marguerite ! I thought I lost you . Where am I ? But I felt the bullet . - I 'm burning ! - No , Marguerite , It 's all right . We are ghosts like Askwith is in our world . We are together on . I want an explanation . I swear I shoot her dead . I believe they are spies . They are not the crewmen that we selected . Lord Churchill , there is an explanation . Captain . How long would it taken to assemble a backup crew ? No more than half an hour . Very well , Reburn ... Whoever you are ... you have 30 minutes to present your story . Tick . Tock . You are running out of time Askwith . What you expect me to believe if that you are from the future . More accurately , Lord Churchill ... it 's a different realities ... can be considered to be based upon ... relativistic frame of references which ... Oh yes , seven years from the future . Yes , seven years from the future . I see , I see . And ah , is this war over ? 1918 , the Allies won . Hard thing to say for German spy . Spies we are not ! So you say . So you say . But I guaranty you are no more travelers in time than ... that I 'm Prime Minister . Ah , I don 't know about that . But in a few years you will be Secretary of State for War . If you really want to convince me you know the future ... then tell me something that 's going to happen tomorrow . Then we shall see if it 's coming to pass . Tomorrow it will be too late , it has to be today within the hour . Otherwise we are trapped for an eternity . Well I doubt it will take that long . The time has a way of running out . Winnie , you must listen to us . Winnie ? I want to tell you something else that happens in a few years ... something personal concerning you and me . I believe the details require a private conversation . Excellent ! Not even you wouldn 't be able to reach me in there . Got you ! - Imagine ... - I beg your pardon . our Marguerite and Winston ' Bloody ' Churchill . I 'd rather not ! Oh He 's going to be a great man someday . Full of promise . A little too full of something , if you ask me . Absolutely fascinating . - Lorry 's arrived , Sir . - Captain . - I 'll escort you out . - What to the airship ? Oh , no , no , I don 't think so . Why not ? Because you have convince me my dear . - Come along ! - I don 't know who you people are . Or how you know what you know . But until I do , you are not going near that airship . Well-done Marguerite , well-done . Thank you my dear . A little smoke should drive you out there . Now I 'll signalize the signals fire to guide your airship back . One is for safety . Two for luck . Three , so they just can 't miss . Times up , Askwith . Your airship needs you . Tanks are full , sir . Very good What about the lines ? The lines are secure ready for release . That 's our ride home . Less than in a minute get to it . All fueled and ready to go . We 'd got those engines running in two minutes . All we need is a distraction . May 26 , 1915 , I remember . You 've already established you know the date . Two years from now , you will tell me ... this was one of the worst days you ever lived during the war . I 'm beginning to see it that way . But it doesn 't compares to what happened at the Dardanelles , does it ? Yes that right . Four British warship sent by mines . A Navy force to withdraw in total defeat . - It 's a national tragedy . - I quite aware what were wrong . I took the risk . The failure was my responsibility . And today is the day the Prime Minister made you paid for it . By relieving you of your duty ... as First Lord of the Admiralty . - He would not dare . - Call him ! Call him ! - Get your hands of me cha ... . - Hit him . - But it 's Winston ' Bloody ' Churchill . - So ? - Sorry , Winnie . - Oh , I do love a woman in uniform ! - I might just believe you . Oh the backup crew is taking off . Excuse me , this bus pass over Victoria Station ? I don 't think so . Right , of course neither put anyway that makes sense . Just try this one . Shhh , trying to concentrate . Fine ! Roxton ! No ! Stop the engines , please . One of us is going for a swing . And it won 't be me . Marguerite release the mooring ropes . - Great work , Marguerite ! - Hi ! Time to fly . Sorry First Lord , I ... Sir ! First Lord ? It 's from the Prime Minister office . I 've been relieved of my duties . That young woman was right . About everything . So , Marguerite , tell me ... What did happen when you meet the First Lord Churchill ? We had a perfectly lovely time . And he gave me a medal . I had drinks with his wife . All in all , it was a delightful evening . Drinks ? with his wife . - So you , never ... - Never . Because that Churchill back there , well ... He certainly think something . Well , why wouldn 't he , Lord Roxton ? Given the right incentive , some men will believe just about anything . Ready to go home ? - You know you can 't kill me , Veronica . - I don 't need to kill you . I just need to slow down . - Where are we ? - You don 't recognize it ? This is were your airship first landed when you came to the plateau . I 'm guessing there 's where it 'll come back . How can you of all people confine me to be alone for ever . You better keep you story straight . You told me that when your ship comes back I ended up on it with you . But you know that 's not true , don 't you ? You 've always known that you are the one who 's cursed , and not your ship . Ned Malone died a coward . - No he didn 't . - I tore the parachute from his hands . I heart him scream like a frightened child . I found his body . Not far from those cliffs . I don 't believe you . Torn apart by raptors by now , I expect . But you might find a few scattered bones to mourn . Stop it ! The ship . It 's coming back . It 's the storm all right . Is the same we went pass through when we first come to the plateau . Same kind of storm that sent us into the cliff . That 's this means we are back in our own reality yet . We 'll know it when we get six hundreds feet . That when Askwith said all stars to begin . Almost there . Almost there ! Malone ! Malone ! Malone ! Malone ! We 're there . It 's coming , I can hear it . No . Here it is , I knew it . I 've never though I be happy to see this again . - I can see signals fires . - Where 's Malone ? - I don 't know . - We only had enough fuel to land this thing once , if we don 't get out then ... nothing will stop us for racing back into the storm forever . Blood ! Looks like your ship doesn 't want me anymore . I 'm not gonna be able to land this thing . I 'll go back to low the ramp . Yeah . Challenger ! There 's someone down there by the fire . It 's Veronica and Askwith , Veronica . - Damn you . - Already taken care . Looks like the pilot is back on board . I hold it steady you two get out ... I 'm not going without you , George . I 'll be right behind you , now go ! Come on ! Come on ! Down here ! Jump Marguerite , jump ! Come on Challenger . Get off ! Where 's Challenger and Malone ? Challenger 's still on the ship . Come on Challenger . Get off that thing ! - Where 's Ned ? - We don 't know ! Where is he ? Please , hold steady for ten more seconds . Going somewhere ? You are the only one who belongs here , Askwith . Haven 't you heart ? misery loves company . Come on , George , hurry on . We are heading back to 6,100 feet Challenger . It 's getting to high . It 's not going to make it . How does it feel ? Knowing that you are going to spent the next 7 years in hell . This one belongs to you . No ! Challenger ! Oh my God ! They 're gone . After all we 've been through I can 't believe Challenger is gone . It looks like somebody made it . - A parachute . - But who ? Challenger ! You made it old boy . You made it . - George . - Stand back . Just be careful . That would be most inconvenient at two hundred feet . Ha he ha ! Oh , Veronica ! This plateau has taken everyone I 've ever loved . Malone is still alive . We did see him ... in a way . He was really with us . At least for a while . He is still out there , I know he is and we are going to find him . We are going to solve the mystery of this plateau , and when we do .. that 's how we going to find our way back home . All of us . Together . Home sweet home . Sure beats Pullham air station that for sure . Oh , I don 't know . I love a man in uniform . Be careful , Marguerite , I might believe you . Do you think Winnie will remember our little adventure , George ? No , I don 't imagine so . I 'm sure Lord Churchill is just a ... greater part of the mystery of this strange plateau . Do you think we 'll ever solve this greater mystery ? That 's a good question , Marguerite . At first I thought we were trapped in an essentially ordinary , if ... remote part of the world where anything could happen ... within reason . - Almost anything has happened . - With and without reason ! The more I think about it , the more I feel that there 's an underlying ... pattern to every odd event we 've witnessed , every ... unusual group of people we 've met . I heard my parents talking about that once . They were wondering if the plateau 's mysteries had only one answer . Well , if anyone can answer that , - It 'd be you , George . - I agree with you . Well , not on my own . Not question of that . We are no solving anything , we 'd better back to work . Veronica , we just got home . Can the four of us has a rest for a moment at all . Five of us you mean . *

 Previously on " The 4400 " . Listen up , everyone . We 're Defcon One . - It 's not a flyby . - A comet can 't change course . - This one has . - Then it 's not a comet . There appears to be something out there . The light has gone and thousands of people have suddenly appeared . Finding Shawn and figuring out what happened to our son is my job . Diana Skouris , Tom Baldwin . You will be one of the teams responsible for investigating the returnees . What about my parents ? They 're dead , aren 't they ? This is Maia Rutledge . She 's eight years old , only she was born in 1938 . No time has passed . Returnee 2,117 , Shawn Farrell . - Uncle Tommy . - He 's all yours . - What about Kyle ? - Kyle 's in a coma , Shawn . We 're letting them go . We don 't have a legal right to hold them . Shawn ! - Remember me ? - Nikki ? - I 'm Richard . - Lily . - Lily Bonham from St Louis ? - You knew my grandmother . Some people have no place to go . - What you looking at ? - I used to live here . Heidi ? Heidi , it 's Mommy . It 's OK , sweetie . - Brian . - Lily . There 's no mistake . You 're definately pregnant . - It 's a restraining order . - You can 't stop me seeing her . Who knows where all this is going ? We 've got one case . Maybe that 's all . You haven 't noticed anything unusual with Shawn ? I need to know if you had you 'd tell me . What looks good today , Carl ? I have a white fish with your name on it , Mrs Martino . When you were gone , in 18 months , I haven 't got a decent piece of fish . You ... you take care of me . - You are such a sweetheart . - Oh , it 's easy being nice to you . Tell me , how does it feel to be back ? It 's OK . It 's good . Carl . It 's like I never left . What do you think you 're doing out there ? I was helping a customer . Rosie and Derek can help a customer . I said stock the display cases . But I 've known Mrs Martino since I was a kid . And I 'm supposed to care ? Now , get that flounder on ice . Grace . - So how 'd it go today ? - Slow as usual . It 's the neighbourhood . It 's not like it used to be . - It 's not that bad . - It 's gotten worse since you were away . - I don 't see it . - You don 't want to see it . OK , I admit it . It 's not like when we were kids . No one cares about the place any more . There 's no pride . There 's no sense of community . I didn 't know you were so unhappy . I 'm not unhappy . I got you back , didn 't I ? I got nothing to complain about . Yeah . - Oh . - Oh , I 'm sorry . Fish smell . I don 't mind . I 'll hop in the shower when we get back . - Let 's cut across the park . - Nobody goes into Bradley Park . No . Yeah ? Sure they do . How do you think I got here ? It 's not safe . There 's nothing but lowlifes and junkies in there . Grace , 15 years ago I proposed to you in this park . 15 years ago I was a size 2 and you had your hair down to your shoulders . Things change . From now on , you take the long way around . Grace , I just wish that you 'd stop worrying . - Marry me , Gracie . - Of course I will . Yo , what are you doing in our park , man ? Your park ? Just give up your wallet . - You 're mugging me ? - Now you 're catching on . - Seven bucks ! - It 's all I have . The complaints started after her foster parents brought her back to quarantine . What kind of complaints ? Well , for instance , yesterday Maia spoke to a cafeteria employee . She told her that her daughter would be in the hospital soon , but would be OK . Then the little girl was in a car accident . So you 're saying she 's got some kind of second sight ? I have five stories just like that one . Why hold a little girl for 60 years and then send her back able to predict the future ? What were they thinking ? - We don 't know if there is a they . - He , she it , take your pick . Let 's leave that for the team in the theory room . We 're not playing video games . That 's why they 're intimidated . They feel your hostility . Good . Don 't worry too much about the big brains . Just talk to that girl . Thanks . I never meant to scare anyone . We know that , sweetie . But why did you say those things to Mrs Krause about her daughter ? - Because they 're true . - But how did you know ? I just do . If I asked you if it was going to rain next Sunday , would you know the answer ? Maybe . I don 't know . What 's going to happen to me now ? The doctors here are going to take another look at you . Don 't worry . It won 't hurt . I don 't believe you . It 's gonna hurt , isn 't it ? You might be uncomfortable some of the time , but mostly it 's going to be boring . - Will you look in on me now and then ? - Me ? To see that I 'm all right . Sure . - It 's expensive . - Rental vouchers will cover it . So ... do you have any questions ? The small bedroom , do you think it 'll get too much light for a nursery ? It 's a northern exposure , so you should be all right . So what do you think ? - I like it . - Me , too . - Is this your first baby ? - Oh ... we 're not actually a couple . Oh , so it 's just you and the baby . No , it 'll be the three of us . Why not ? You can 't stay in that hotel forever . We can share this place . Unless you don 't want to . No . No , I 'd like that . Great . I 'll go do the paperwork . - I hope I didn 't embarrass you . - No . It 's ... It 's not that . I figure he wouldn 't rent you the place if I was part of the deal . I know , I know . It 's not 1951 any more . Times have changed , but ... Sometimes I 'm just surprised at how much . Good . It 's settled , then ? Oh , God . Lily ? Lily , what is it ? - Oh . - Lily ? I don 't feel so good . You need to sit down . Shall I call a doctor ? - No , no . No , let 's just leave . - And go where ? Anywhere but here . Carl , where have you been ? - I got mugged . - Oh , God . Are you all right ? - Did they hurt you ? - I didn 't get hurt . They got hurt . - Who did ? - I learned something important tonight . I 'm a different man . Those aliens , or whoever took me , they did something . They took me . They changed me . They made me better . First thing in the morning call the counsellor and make an appointment . I don 't have time for that . I 've got things to do . - What kind of things ? - The park , Gracie ! I want to make it like it was before . People will bring their kids again . You and me , we can have our picnics at the old spot . - Carl , you 're scaring me . - Wh ... There 's nothing to be scared of , not any more . Linda , any idea why Dr Mayhew wants to see us ? He didn 't say . So how have you been ? Good . My lawyer was asking if you 'd signed those divorce papers yet . I thought maybe if we had dinner one night ... we could sign them together . You mean make plans that you cancel at the last minute ? I 'll bring the papers , we 'll have a good meal , a couple of glasses of wine ... And a good cry . That , too . Stefano 's ? Yeah . Where else ? Tom , Linda , thanks for coming in . I reviewed Kyle 's EEG readout and noticed something peculiar . What now ? Last Thursday he had a burst of brain activity . It was brief , no more than a few seconds . That 's good , isn 't it ? Technically , yes . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . I 'll run tests , see if I can find out what happened . We 've had three years of tests . I understand your frustration , but we need to look into this . - It 's a roller coaster , isn 't it ? - Never ends . Linda . So Stefano 's , right ? How does Thursday night sound , 7 : 30 ? I 'll be there . - Dorothy . - Yeah . Did anyone visit last Thursday night , besides his mother and me ? Let me check . Yes . He had one other visitor . Your nephew Shawn . Shawn ! Yeah , I went and saw Kyle on Thursday night . He 's my cousin . I wanted to see him . - What about it ? - Nothing happened there ? I was only there for a couple of minutes . So you saw nothing , did nothing ? What could I have done ? At your welcome home party , a bird smacked into the window , remember ? It was stunned . What about it ? No , it was more than that . And then ... you picked it up . Suddenly , it was alive and well . What the hell did you do to Kyle ? Argh ! I didn 't do anything to him . Look , I really like these chats we have , Uncle Tommy , but I gotta go to class . Shawn . - We 'll talk again . - Oh , I can 't wait . We 're going to see Fountains Of Wayne this weekend . Have fun . You know , this whole loner thing is so tired . Well , it works for me . Fountains of Wayne ... Friday night ! What is with you ? Why do you keep pushing him ? Someone has to . I don 't see you doing anything . I 'm giving him his space , let him figure things out for himself . You should try it sometime . Ugh ! Marco . Skouris . Good . I checked out your idea . - What idea ? - So am I a genius or am I crazy ? We don 't make that distinction . I visited a sampling of disappearance sites on the west coast . You were right . The gravity there is weaker . - But only by five parts per billion . - That 's barely measurable . Not to mention barely understandable . English , please . The gravity changed at some places people disappeared . The question is , was it natural or was it manipulated ? If it was manipulated , the question is , by who ? So back to alien abductions ? I won 't rule out little green men . I need more measurements . In other words , you 've made no progress . Er ... you explain it to him . Oh , hold on ! You remember Adam Kensington ? The insurance guy Orson Bailey killed . Yeah , what about him ? Not one of the good guys as it turns out . He was in an insurance scheme to defraud policy holders . Bailey saved Washington state a billion-dollar buy-out . - Could have been Enron all over again . - That 's interesting . Brings up all kinds of possibilities . Well , er ... don 't be a stranger . So are you saying whoever sent him back meant him to go after Kensington ? It 's a theory . That 's why they call it the theory room . That 's tight . Oh , no . I suck . Hey , is this about the concert thing ? No , no , it 's got nothing to do with that . I just want to know what 's going on with you and Nikki . Me and Nikki what ? I just want to know what 's going on between you . - What do you think 's going on ? - Something . She 's always talking about you . Can 't go anywhere without her wanting to bring you along . - How 's that my problem , Danny ? - Just do me a favour . Leave her alone . I thought that 's what I 'd been doing . Look , you got a problem with her , go talk to her about it . Yeah . We 're the same age . - I 'm not your little brother now . - Then stop acting like a two-year-old . You 're my brother . She 's your girlfriend . It 's all good ... right ? Yeah , right . Richard , I am so glad I found this place . Now we have a new apartment , we can get you a computer . Forget about the computer . Let 's get you to a doctor . I 'm fine . I know this is going to sound strange , but that other place we looked at , the baby didn 't like it . Maternal instincts kicking in already , huh ? No , it 's not that . It 's that somehow I know what the baby 's thinking . Lily , the baby 's barely two months along . It 's not thinking anything . I can 't explain it any more than you can explain where you 've been for 50 years , or what 's happened to us during the time we 've been gone . I don 't sound too strange , do I ? Of course not . Lily ? I used to rock Heidi like that when she was a baby . - It feels like yesterday , but it wasn 't . - No . It was what ... 11 years ago ? I want to see Heidi . I miss her . Lily , give it some time . Once Brian 's used to you being back , he 'll drop the restraining order . Don 't move ! Stop it ! Cut it out ! It isn 't funny ! Shut up ! Just shut up ! Hey , guys , why don 't you leave her alone ? - Get lost ! - No ! You get lost . Go get him , man ! Come on ! Hey , Maia . How long have they left you like this ? A while . I think they all went on their coffee break . Oh ! Well ! You know , that 's pretty dumb of them , isn 't it ? - Will you stay until they come back ? - Of course . When they show up , your doctors and I are going to have a little talk . - And then can I go home ? - Home ? With you . I don 't like being here alone . - You want to stay with me ? - You don 't like being alone either . I can always come back for my checkups . Please . Look , Maia , I 'm not even sure I 'm the kind of person I want to live with . No , I ... eat cold pizza for breakfast and ... - That sounds all right to me . - Yeah . You know , Maia , just let me think about it , OK ? - Where have you been ? - I was looking in on Maia . - Really ? - I promised her , didn 't I ? - So what have you got ? - Sid lent us his research clippings . I think I found something worth checking out . One guy taking on three attackers isn 't far-fetched . But if you saw him , you 'd think it was impossible . He was ... 35 , 40 , maybe five-foot-six , weighed 150 pounds . - So not exactly the Rock , huh ? - It was the way that he moved . Could he have been on drugs , maybe PCP ? He didn 't act like he was on drugs . You know , most guys would have walked away . Or , er ... maybe called the cops later , after it was too late . But , er ... this guy , he saved me . I 'm sorry . Baldwin . Linda . Dinner . Yeah , no ... Linda , I 'm s ... Don 't hang up , Linda . Just ... - Anything else you can remember ? - One thing . This guy ... I don 't mean to be rude or anything , but ... he smelled funny . Like day-old fish . So that was your wife on the phone ? - I don 't want to talk about it . - Fair enough . So are we in Orson Bailey territory here ? I wouldn 't rule it out , which would give us what ? A telekinetic insurance salesman , a clairvoyant eight-year-old , and now some kind of super vigilante . - Hell of a trio . - They 're only the ones we know about . Unless you can think of anyone else . Just take it one case at a time . Heidi , can you remember the formula for an isosceles triangle ? Hey . I 'm probably not the best at this , but ... Oh ! - Richard ? - Lily . Thank God . Are you all right ? - I was worried sick . Where are you ? - I 've been arrested . Carl , I have my grandchildren coming for dinner . - How about some nice swordfish ? - You can 't go wrong with swordfish . - Carl ! - Give me a second , Burt . You got like ... What did I tell you about chatting when work has to be done ? - Please stop with the finger . - Stop ? I asked you not to do that . Let go ! I mean it . I show up on time . I do my work . Now just leave me alone . - OK ? - OK , OK . So ... how much swordfish are we talking here ? There 's a lot of chatter in DC about putting the 4400 back in quarantine . Not that I agree . If they 're dangerous , how is cramming them into one space going to be safer ? ... so I took my pistol and I shot her in the forehead . Shot who ? Do us a favour , Tom , sign the divorce papers . Do me a favour , Dennis , stay out of it . - I spoke to her . - What are you doing talking to Linda ? I danced with her at your wedding , now I 'm not supposed to talk to her ? - I was in the middle of an investigation . - Tom . You asked her for dinner and you stood her up . It slipped my mind . Maybe . Maybe you just don 't want to admit the truth to yourself . - Brian Moore ? - Yeah . - I 'm Richard Tyler , a friend of Lily 's . - You another one of those 4400 ? Is that a problem ? Look , I told her to stay away , but she wouldn 't listen . I understand you 're upset , but Lily 's in jail . You don 't want that . What I want is a normal life for my daughter , for my family . - It won 't happen again . - I 'm supposed to take your word for it ? I promise , if you drop the charges , she 'll never bother you or Heidi ever again . You used to love her once , remember ? Yeah , I remember . - I want you to stop . - I can 't ! What do you mean , " can 't " ? What you 're doing is dangerous , not to mention illegal . You can 't just go around beating people up . I 've been given an opportunity and I 'm going to take it . I 'll clean up that park and then I 'll clean up the neighbourhood . Oh , God , you sound like a crazy man . You promised me you 'd call your counsellor . - I never said that . You said it . - Tomorrow , I 'm going to call him . You 'd call Homeland Security on me ? The way you 're acting , can you blame me ? What I 'm doing here , I 'm doing for us , Grace . This is where we live . I just want us to be happy and not be afraid any more and it starts with Bradley Park ! - I don 't want it to end there . - It won 't . I won 't let it . They can 't hurt me . No one can . You 're just one man . I lost you once and I don 't want to lose you again . I can do it . I can make this neighbourhood safe again . For you , for Mrs Martino ... even Burt . So please stop worrying . This is what I was meant to do . This is my destiny . This was brand new when I disappeared . And it 's a ... What do you call it ? Golden oldie . I guess I 'm a golden oldie , too . No , not to me . Hey , we have to talk about what happened last night . No , there 's nothing to talk about . Do you know what I saw when I looked through Brian 's window ? A happy family . I realised Heidi doesn 't need me . - Maybe one day ... - I 'll be there for her if she does . But until then I 'll stay away . This is where I want to be now , here with you . Where I 'm happy . And the baby 's happy . Well , that makes three happy people . All you 've done for me it 's not because I remind you of the other Lily , is it ? Maybe at first . Now all I see is you . - Danny 's inside . - I 'm not here to see Danny . Cute . Can you turn it back on , please ? Did Danny say something to you ? Is that why you 're acting like his ? Our friendship has nothing to do with him . Nikki , we don 't have a friendship , OK ? Shawn , listen to me ... Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Hey , hey , come here . Let me see it . Let me see . It 's gone . It doesn 't hurt any more . It must not have been that bad of a burn . Yes , it was . You did something to it , didn 't you ? Tom . See , the thing about vigilantes is that they 're not very common , except in Charles Bronson movies , so I have to create my own profile . Now , we know he 's a white male , slender , somewhere between 30 and 50 . He works a blue-collar job , has low self-esteem , lives in a high-crime area . I 'm with you so far . I cross-checked my profile with the members of the 4400 in and around the Seattle area and I came up with 37 names . You 're not taking me through all 37 . Of those 37 , I was able to eliminate 24 . I 'm sure you don 't care how . - And that left me with 13 . - I 'm on the edge of my seat . Here are my two favourites - Robert Lorenzano and Carl Morrissey . They both fit the profile , but Carl , he 's our guy . Check out his occupation . - Supermarket employee . - Yeah , I called the store . Carl works in the seafood section . - And our guy smelled like day-old fish . - Oh , yeah . I 'm good . Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? I just cleaned that ! Come on ! We 'd like to talk to your husband . Why ? - Any idea where he was Tuesday night ? - He was here . - You sure about that ? - I just told you . Have you heard of the " Bradley Park vigilante " ? What does that have to do with Carl ? You tell us , Mrs Morrissey . You 're not going to throw him back into quarantine , are you ? - We want to help him . - That 's funny . That 's all Carl wants to do is help . People grumble but nobody does anything , nobody tries to make anything better , except Carl . Where is he , Mrs Morrissey ? - Carl . - Grace . I got rid of all the graffiti . Oh , my God , Carl . You should have seen it . They were falling like bowling pins . I didn 't see the knife . I don 't know why I didn 't see the knife . - This is Agent Baldwin ... - Get an ambulance ! Get an ambulance to Bradley Park right away . I thought I could clean the whole neighbourhood up myself . I thought that 's why they sent me back , but I guess I was wrong . No , no , no , no ! No , don 't leave me , Carl . Please . No ! No ! I just want you . I just ... want you . No . Why give him extra juice to think he can make a difference , send him back ... Only to get himself killed . - What 's the point ? - I wish to hell I knew . The wife of slain Bradley Park vigilante , Carl Morrissey , revealed that her husband was one of the controversial 4400 . Mrs Morrissey stated that her husband was a true neighbourhood hero , a sentiment echoed by many area residents . Law enforcement officials and a spokesperson for the National Threat Assessment Command refused to confirm or deny Mrs Morrissey 's statement . That paperwork . OK . I need you to sign there . And there . And initial here . - And sign there . - That 's it ? You got Mr Ryland to sign the approvals , that simplifies things . - I thought you were one of the doctors . - Yeah . I thought you were asleep . So you sure fooled me . - How would you like to get out of here ? - Now ? Right now . Look out , look out , look out ! - Where 's Kyle ? - Surgery . Dr Mayhew said he 's got some kind of fluid building up in his skull . They 're trying to relieve the pressure . What do you mean " trying " ? They said that draining the fluid might not be enough . That more might build up and if it does , then Kyle could suffer permanent brain damage within a week . Uncle Tommy , Mom 's on the way .

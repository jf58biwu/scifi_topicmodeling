 Jake Foley was an ordinary guy until a freak accident transformed him into the world 's first computer-enhanced man . Millions of microscopic computers interface with his biochemistry and make him stronger and faster , able to see and hear farther than normal men . They give him the power to control technology with his brain . Jake Foley - America 's secret weapon . He takes on missions no ordinary agent can perform . He is the ultimate human upgrade . Stay sharp , Jake , could be anyone . Sector one all clear . This is two . Nothing here displacing a ticket counter . Copy that , two . Possible multiple targets in three 's location . Moving west to the food court . Give us the word . Check that . It 's nothing . Got a guy with a suitcase . Fits the profile . Mid to late 30s . Possible ex-military . Give us the word . Possible confirmation at Foley 's 20 . He 's opening his bag ... False alarm . That 's a negative . Standing by . Kyle , Kyle ! Trash can , north exit . I 'm on the suspect . Guy is white , baseball cap , khakis . He 's heading for the escalators . Roger that , two is moving . Three 's rolling . He 's down ! Do not move ! Do not move ! What do we have ? That canister was full of ricin gas . Coagulant fuse . It would have liquefied and released in five minutes . Hundreds could have died . Tokyo all over again . He doesn 't fit the profile . He 's just a kid . Why would he do that ? It 's because it 's all he knows . Both our intel and the viciousness of the attack point to one conclusion : Today 's incident was the work of Ethan Fulton 's militia . Fulton is an extremely dangerous and driven man . His wife Ann was FBI . She was gunned down in a botched raid on Henry Travis ' compound near Bozeman in 1994 . Fulton blames the government for her death , not without some merit . Who is this guy ? Chief Director Skerritt . Lou 's boss . - Lou has a boss ? - Shhh . We 've been targeting Fulton 's militia for years . They are responsible for six domestic terrorist attacks including the near miss on the Supreme Court in April . Now , as you can see , we haven 't been able to I.D. many of them . So today 's capture is a very important step forward in our investigation . Now I would like to acknowledge Agent Foley 's part in that capture . - Lou 's boss just complimented me . - I heard . We have an I.D. on the assailant ? No , sir . He 's being interrogated right now . You keep me posted . Excellent work , all of you . Good-bye , sir . It was very nice to meet ... Okay , you heard him . Fulton is aware the noose is tightening so watch your backs . Hey ! Yo , chill ! Is that any way to treat your kid brother ? ! Oh Jerry ? Oh ... I could have killed you . Yeah , yeah , right , dude , right . What are you doing here ? Came to see you , of course ... also , our nation 's great capitol . I hear downtown 's strip club-alicious . That 's me . Jake Foley , I 'm in Tech Support . Security Clearance : Low . Very low . Then one day , it all changed . Life just got real interesting . - Okay , Ensenada . - How could I forget ? Booze cruise , bikini twins , discotheque . No . Federales , a pumped stomach and a switchblade fight . No , it was a butterfly knife . You dug it . Admit it . All right , I will admit that you talked us out of it . I 'll give you that . Um , hello . Can we get some Servicio , Por Fa-please ? Oh , god . So , why aren 't you in school ? I needed a break . You know , I 've been working pretty hard . I got classes every Tuesday and Thursday . Uh-huh . Plus I wanted to hang with my big bro . Mom and dad know you 're here ? Jake , I keep mom and dad on a strictly need-to-know basis . What happened there ? Um , it 's a work-related accident . Oh , what your motherboard cut ? - What up ? - You guys ready to order ? Uh , beer . Start with a pitcher of draft . Can I see your I.D. ? Oh , he 's 26 . He just looks young . Your I.D. Oh , me . Oh , um , because when we left , you were going to drive , so I ... I left my wallet at the house . I 'm sorry . I can 't serve you then . This is my brother . He 'll vouch for me . Oh , right . Yeah , he 'll have a red bull . Make that two , please . Thank you . You call yourself a big brother ? That 's right . I 'll let you make it up to me . What do you say we shock on our red bulls and hit the strip clubs ? Jerry , I can 't . I have to be at work tomorrow . Hey , if I can make it through a rigorous day of study with a massive hangover , I think you could , too . I 'll do you a favor ; if I can get off work tomorrow night , we 'll go out and do something fun , okay ? Yeah , I can 't wait . Anyway , don 't worry about me . You won 't even know I 'm here . I promise . Hmm . Sorry . Whoa ! Yo , Jake , wake up . Jerry , I 'm trying to sleep . It 's kinda important . Oh , what is it ? - Promise you won 't get all pissed ? - Oh , just say it . I need a fire extinguisher ... like pronto . What ? Okay , you 're done . Your vitals look good . Have you had any lightheadedness or nausea since we had to , you know , reboot the nanites ? Since you saved my life ? Yeah . No , I 'm fine . Okay . Any recent glitches , complications , any abnormalities ? My little brother 's in town . He 's a bit of all three . - I didn 't even know you had a brother . - Mm-hmm . Hmm . He 's checking out Georgetown or burning down my apartment , whichever comes first . How old is he ? Nineteen ... going on six . Hmm . A little immature . No , no , he 's a lot immature . When I was his age , I was working two part-time jobs while was taking eighteen credits at Georgetown . Did you have to walk six miles in the snow every day to get there , too ? Funny . I 'm serious . I don 't get it . He 's a smart kid . He could go far . He always screws it up . He has no focus , you know ? Who does at 19 ? Oh , well , except for you and Bill Gates . - Huh , duty calls . - Yeah . Stop by any time . I have good news and bad news . The young man who put ricin gas in the subway is Caleb Fulton , Ethan Fulton 's only son . Now , Ethan blames the government for the loss of his wife and our capturing his son will not sit well . On the other hand , Caleb grew up inside of the militia . He knows it inside and out . And next to capturing his father , he 's our best hope in shutting them down . - What 's he saying ? - Nothing . Our best interrogators are working on him . So let 's get back to work . Follow every lead , every scrap of intel . Um , do you think maybe I could talk to him ? It 's just we might have a connection 'cause I was the one that captured him , and we 're closer in age than you guys . Not that you 're old or anything . You look great . It 's just , uh ... I think he might relate to me better , possibly . Quit while you 're ahead , Jake . See what you can do . Well , your pistons are shot , your gas filter 's rusted and it looks like you might have a crack in your engine block . But I could have it ready Monday . Say hello to the wife for me . Thanks , Jimmy . I owe you . They knew what we were doing before half our men did . Now , can you explain to me how I let my son walk right into an NSA sting ? You didn 't crypt the final transmission to our people in Virginia . Ethan ... There is no excuse that is going to free my son . Sir . There 's been some concern among the men about Caleb . That they might possibly force him into talking . Caleb won 't talk . And neither will he . Caleb . I 'm Jake . You 're pretty quick . Thought I was chasing Emmitt Smith down there in that subway yesterday . I guess that 's appropriate since you were all-league running back in high school . Was it 24 touchdowns you scored your senior year ? That 's impressive . I can barely score five when I 'm playing Madden on my PlayStation . You should try the rookie setting , it 's easier . Yeah , I will . I 'll try that . Thank you . So you read my file ? Yeah . Yeah , I did . But this isn 't your file . Have you ever seen what ricin gas does to the human body ? That little boy right there is three years old . That 's his sister . That 's her mom . The gas fills your lungs . It feels like fire , but really it 's more like drowning because your lungs literally burst . That 's why there 's so much blood . You almost did that to a lot of innocent people yesterday . But you didn 't . It 's not too late , you can change your life . I can help . How ? Tell us where your father is . I 'd rather die than betray my father . He did not say that . What do you look like ? So , what are you going to do tonight ? You should totally come over . Jerry ... Hey , you got to try everything once . And I 'm telling you , you haven 't lived life until you 've tasted my pasta a la Jerry . Now get your buns over here and I 'll prove it . She so wants me . You met a girl already ? No . You did . Sarah . She as hot as she sounds ? My Sarah ? Were you talking to her ? No , relax , bro , it 's fine . I know we talked forever . She 's coming over to see you . - Whoa , whoa , tonight ? - Yeah , man . I 'm hooking you up . What 's the deal with you two ? Nothing . We 're friends . Oh , I get it . She 's a bowser . No . Fat ? She is beautiful and she 's intelligent , okay ? - So ... ? - So ... it 's complicated . And it 's none of your business . Hey , whatever you say , man . Do you mind keeping it down for a while ? I 'm gonna squeeze in a nap before smackdown . Thanks . Any progress ? - We know he 's NSA . - We knew that yesterday . We know he 's local . We believe he works out of Fort Mead . I want the name and location of the man who captured my son . And then I want him standing right here in front of me so I can kill him myself . Yes , sir . Pasta a la Jerry coming your way ! Sarah . Sarah . - No worries . - Don 't eat the food . - I 'm serious . - I 'll mop that up later . Dinner ... is served . So , uh , what 's in this ? Uh , pasta , vietnamese hot sauce and selected seasonings . It 's a dorm room classic . Dig in , Wedgie . Wedgie ? One of Jake 's many nicknames . So what do you call him ? Oh , no , I 'm far too mature to embarrass Jerry like that . Right , Humper ? I don 't even want to know . We 've just begun picking up some encrypted chatter from Fulton 's militia . First time since the ricin incident . That 's right . We believe there 's something going down tonight . How long before we can decode it ? It 's an algorithmic encryption . It 's gonna take a while . Get every one of your code breakers on this thing immediately . You 've got to hear this one . Jake shows up to Cheryl Rhodes ' sweet 16 dressed like Gene Simmons . I mean , full KISS makeup , leather codpiece ... They told me it was a costume party . Look at the time . No , no , no . Hey , hey I 've got one more . No , no , Jerry , you really don 't . Hey , this may be Sarah 's only opportunity to know the real you . Right ? It 's Christmas , and I was , like , seven . And all I 'd asked for that year was this kick-ass red huffy bike . Apparently , " Santa " got the message because Christmas morning , there it was along with a list of rules from my dad . Number one being you always lock the bike . - Wha ... ? - So Christmas Day , I 'm riding that sucker all over town like it 's a Ferrari . I pop into the store for a soda and when I come out , it 's gone . Jake finds me two hours later crying my eyes out . We go home and Jake tells my dad he borrowed my bike and forgot to lock it up . Yeah , he got grounded for three weeks just to keep his little brother out of trouble . That is so sweet . I 'll be right back . Cool story , huh ? None of that ever happened . It 's no biggie , she 'll never know . That 's not the point , Jerry . Hey , I 'm helping you seal the deal . You can thank me later . Where are you going ? I 'm clearing the runway , man . You can 't land a plane when your little brother 's sleeping on the airstrip . I 'm not to trying to land a plane . Hey , that 's your own issue . Can I borrow some cash ? I 'm a little light . You know , from dinner . Yeah , sure . Take whatever you need from my wallet . Where 's Jerry ? Uh , he had to go . You , uh ... pizza ? - Yeah . - Yeah . I thought you might be cold . Your father never told you about this part , did he ? I 'm prepared to die for my cause . Did your daddy teach you that ? Caleb , how many people have to die before you realize your mother 's never coming back ? I take it you 're not married . Got any kids ? That 's none of your business . No matter , I can tell . In your world , your job comes first . In ours , it 's family , it 's loyalty to your blood . I feel sorry for you . The feeling is mutual , Caleb . Hey , can I help you ? Uh , scotch , neat , two napkins . You got your I.D. , kid ? I never leave home without it . What kind of scotch ? Uh , the brown kinds . Right . Hey . Hey . You a secret agent or something ? Huh ? I snuck a peek at your NSA badge . You naughty little girl , you . - There you go . - So , are you ? An agent ? I could tell you , but then I 'd have to ... Kill me ? I was going to say " sleep with you , " but , uh , if that 's your thing ... - start a tab . - You got it . You got to understand , we were best friends . We went through the Academy together . We had nicknames . So what happened ? I looked into his scared dark eyes ... and I asked him one more time . I said , " Are you a double agent ? " He took a deep breath ... his hand slowly slipping from mine , and he muttered , " Si , Senor ... Si . " Then I let go ... and watched him plummet to his death . Wow . Right . So where 'd this all happen ? Where did this happen ? Can 't tell you that , sir . It 's classified . Yeah , stupid , it 's classified . All right , the drinks are on Agent Foley . Yeah ! Fo-ley ! Fo-ley ! Anything on Foley ? NSA has him listed as a tech support , but our people in payroll can 't confirm this . There 's no record of him on file . I don 't give a damn where he 's listed . I want to know where he is . We 're working on it , sir . - You check DMV records ? - Came up clear . You can 't take a piss in this country without someone knowing . You 're trying to tell me we can 't find this government piece of trash ? Wait a minute , we got something . Foley just used his credit card in the last ten minutes . - Where ? - Georgetowne Station . It 's a bar on 4th and K street . You get on him , now . But having no idea where little kids come from , I just put it on my Christmas list : One little sister - and I was so pissed when I didn 't get one . I just wanted someone to take care of , you know , like you and Jerry . Oh , Jerry never needed anybody to take care of him . Oh , come on , I heard the bike story . Sarah , uh ... that never happened . What ? He made it up , but that 's Jerry - he 's just trying to help . To help what ? Uh , well I-I guess he thought that-that you and ... and-and me m - uh , I guess he just thought that maybe you 'd like me better if ... Well , he was wrong . Yeah . I don 't need any more reasons to like you , Jake . You got your standard military grip that 's been around since the 1800s . I prefer a more modern approach made popular by rappers and drug dealers . It 's , uh , " let 's kick back " and ... just plain cooler looking . Come on , people , you with me ? We found him . Oh , Jake , you have a little , um ... What ? Here ? Uh , I-I 'll get it . I should ... Answer the phone ? Yeah . Hello ? Uh . Hello ? - Uh , Jake ? - Jerry ? Yeah . I 'm in big trouble . Okay . This one 's for you , and this one 's for you . Let 's just say I understand the part where you take my car without asking and accidentally bump into a police car . Let 's just say that I understand the part where you threaten to call your friend , Mayor Williams , if they don 't let you go . But why would you give them my I.D. and pretend to be me ? First of all , you have a much better driving record , and second , you 're NSA - they should 've let you walk out of professional courtesy . What is wrong with you ? Don 't go all parental on me . We got a couple of tickets - it 's no big . Yes , yes , it is big , Jerry , and the amazing thing is , you don 't see it . You know what ? This has been fun , really , a lot of fun , but I think it 's time you go back to school . I can 't . Why ? Because I dropped out . What ? I don 't need school . Oh , my god . I know this guy , Randy Marshank , he 's making 10k a month with a web cam and a girls ' volleyball team . Jerry , even for you , that is the dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life . Why , because I want to do something with my life ? No , you don 't want to do something with your life . You want to avoid doing anything with your life . - I have a plan . - No , you don 't . No , you don 't . You have a scam . That 's all you ever have . You know what ? I don 't need this . I don 't need some nerd who sits at a computer all day telling me how to live my life - I don 't need you . Good . Good . 'Cause I don 't need some irresponsible child hanging around wrecking my apartment and stealing my stuff ! - Lou ? - Yes ? What 's wrong ? We 've decrypted the chatter from Fulton 's militia . It 's about his next target . What is it ? Jake Foley . Foley . Oh , whoa , oh , hey , man , you were in the bar , right ? And you brought your friend . Oh , is-is this about that girl ? I didn 't touch her , man . She said she was single . Respect , bro - I 'm all about respect . Whoa ! Whoa , take it easy . It 's ... we should all go back to the bar , and I 'm buying . Sorry about ... Let 's go . What ? Jake , it 's Lou . You need to come in right away . They took my son away from me , Foley . And you need to know ... That that was a mistake . What ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I don 't know you . Why are you doing this to me ? This is the NSA nowadays ? We 're going to win this war . I 'm talking about my family , Jake , and how you 're going to pay for what you did . I 'm ... not Jake . I thought he was a little young . He was at the bar spouting off . - He said he was Jake Foley ? - Yeah , he had Jake Foley 's I.D. And credit card . Jerry Foley . Jake 's brother . Oh , god . But at the bar ... Yes , at the bar he was ' spouting off ' . I remember . I 'm sorry , sir . I failed you and your son . You didn 't fail . In fact , you might have saved my son 's life . What 's going on ? We 've had a communication from a man claiming to be ... Ethan Fulton . All right . - Was it about me , or something ? - Yes . - Where is he ? - We don 't know . What do the communications say ? That they 've got your brother . They want an exchange . Him for Fulton 's son . And if we refuse ? What did it say ? If we don 't release Caleb in one hour ... they 're going to kill Jerry . Okay . Okay . So , so , we have his son . So , we figure out a way to do this . Where do they want to do it ? - Jake ... - I get it . - We have to get them to come to us . - Jake , the National Security Agency doesn 't negotiate with terrorists . What ? No , we have to ... This isn 't a negotiation . - We 're just figuring out a way to ... - I realize this is difficult . They have my brother ! And we are doing everything we can . But we do not negotiate . It only makes it more likely that someone else 's brother or sister or father will be taken in the future . We have to help him . I 'm very sorry . - Lou , we got to figure this out . - Jake , I need a little time . No , ee don 't have a little time - we don 't have any time . This is insane . I 'm not going to let them ... He needed me and I wasn 't there for him . And now they 're going ... Please , please . Jake , did you hear Skerritt said ? We don 't negotiate with terrorists . There 's nothing I can do . I ... I can 't go down to Caleb 's cell and let him out . Do you understand ? I can 't do that . Jake , you have ten minutes , and they 're right behind you . Does your brother love you ? We 're about to find out how much . He 's got ... 25 minutes . Put this on . - Why ? What 's going on ? - Don 't ask me any questions . I 'm getting you out of here . Good . Let 's go . Aw , come on . This way . Go . Go . Up the stairs . Okay , try it now . Isn 't technology grand ? Thanks . What the ... ? Call your father . - I told you ... - Caleb , he has my brother . He wants you in exchange . Now I figure we 've got about two minutes before the NSA figures out that you 're gone and I took you . So if you ever want to see your dad again , you call him . Now ! Louise , what you know about Caleb Fulton escaping from a supposedly secure lockdown ? I 'm aware of the situation , and I 'm on it . Well , you better be . You made it . I was pretty scared . You 're my son . You never , ever be afraid of anyone . Not them , understand me ? Yes , sir . He came alone and unarmed . You 're a man of your word . Where 's my brother ? I 'm a man of my word , too . Oh , Jerry . It 's okay . Come on , it 's gonna be okay . You moving on ? It 's how we survive . - What about Caleb ? - What about him ? He 's just a kid . Why don 't you let him have a life ? Because his life is here with his family - with me . And I wouldn 't overstay my welcome if I were you . Come on . Watch your back . There are friendlies in the building ! Standing by . This is the NSA . Throw down your weapons and come out with your hands up ! You are surrounded . Hold your ground . Weapons down ! Let me see your hands ! Hands ! Clear ! Okay , we 're clear . You okay ? Yeah . No . Caleb ... You okay , sir ? Well , we had a terrific success last night . We shut down the militia , arrested Fulton and his men . However ... I have people very high up I have to answer to . I realize that . Do you ? And what am I supposed to tell them about our policy of never negotiating with terrorists ? Tell them we didn 't . God almighty , Beckett , you got bigger ones than I do . Thank you , sir . You ready ? I think so . You going to have any trouble re-enrolling ? You mean the work studies chick in admissions ? - Tight . - Nice . So now , uh , about the parental units ? Yeah , you came to check out Georgetown ... because you insisted on me having a plan ... once you get out of junior college . Sweet . Thanks for everything . Yeah . Okay , enough of the Gilmore Girls . Let 's roll . - So , can I ask you one question ? - Sure . What exactly do you do at the NSA ? I could tell you , but then I 'd have to kill you .

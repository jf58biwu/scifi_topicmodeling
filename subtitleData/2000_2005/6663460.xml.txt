 Check out the yo-yo . What a dork . There 's the yo-yo kid . Oh , my gosh . I can 't believe he brought it to school . Will ! How 's it goin ' ? Great , chuckie . Positively great . Really ? Isn 't today report card day ? Yep . And once again , i 'll show you that the will browning method of sliding by just can 't be beat . Such confidence . I love it . Watch and learn , chuckie . Watch and learn . Oh , hi , will . Is this your locker ? Maybe . Why ? Well , i moved my locker here . I wanted to change my lousy spot . So , will , i was just wondering- - i mean , with the junior social just around the corner- - sorry , heather . I don 't know how to dance . I gotta go . We 'll talk sometime , though . Do lunch . Really ? When ? Uh , sometime . Do lunch ? Who are you , tom cruise ? It 's an expression . It means , maybe next millennium . And as i give you your report cards , i think this is a good time to remind you that your science projects are due in three weeks . I got it covered . For some of you the project is very , very , very important . Because if you don 't get at least a " b , " i 'll be seeing you again in this class next year . That bad ? Nah . It 's no biggie . Watch it , browning . Scottie desota . Man , does he hate you ! I get the guy in trouble once and he holds a grudge forever . Trouble ? You got him suspended . There 's a difference . Let 's get out of here . I better get home and work on my science project . Whatever it is , throw it away and do a real one , will . You gotta nail it . Come on . Who needs an " a , " anyway ? Uh , you do . Voila ! Does it have a name ? Oh , it 's oat bran with some varietal tree bark . It promotes healing , peace , and togetherness . Honey , we have no plates . No , no . We don 't need plates . This is a common pot . We all eat from it . It 's a family bonding thing . Yeah , right . Maybe with some glue , you could bond me and goofball . Allana . So , where are we going on our next family vacation ? I love it when we travel together . Anyone want to see my report card ? I can hardly wait . Um , allana , this is terrific . I guess it runs in the family . Right , will ? Allana . There must be some mistake . A " d " is science . An " f " in social studies ? Social studies , will ? You can get at least a " c " in social studies if you answer every question " washington . " And the same comments over and over again . " Doesn 't apply himself . " " Not enough effort . " " Not trying . " I try . You know i try . But , will , if you 're trying , why do all your teachers say you aren 't ? You leave us no choice- - we have to go to plan " b . " Plan " b " ? I 'm not gonna like plan " b , " am i ? Camp sparticus . Yes ! No ! Please ! Anything but that ! It 's a prison camp ! It 's a highly respected summer boot camp for boys . It 's not a punishment . A summer at camp sparticus will teach you discipline and responsibility . It 'll teach you to push yourself . It 'll turn me into a mindless , uniform-wearing machine . Cool . No more discussion , will . Unless we see a significant improvement in your grades , you 'll be spending the summer at camp sparticus . It 's up to you . Sparticus , the camp of misery and despair ? What am i gonna do ? How ' bout school work ? Maybe start with your science project . I mean , apply yourself for a change . Who are you , my annoying third parent ? No , just a guy who doesn 't want to spend his summer without his best friend . [ Knocking ] i gotta go . Bye . Mom , do you think camp sparticus will still let me in if i can somehow make one leg shorter than the other ? It 's a pretty clever idea . Maybe you should use some of that brain power on your school work , huh ? Whatta ya think ? Sorry , mom . Allana gets " a " s , not me . Sweetheart , i don 't care about " a " s . I care about effort . And so does your dad . He cares very much . Just try , will . That 's all we ask . Don 't hold back so much . You are a wonderful , smart , talented guy . Let people know about it . That 's all i wanted to say . Goodnight , sweetheart . " Grow your own fun ! " Hello , science project . " Ocean pups " one becomes two , victor . Hypercloning . The greatest advance in science in 100 years . We 're gonna be filthy rich . Conrad , how many times do i have to tell you ? It 's not about the money . It 's about everything we can buy with it . That 's right . Soon we 'll be out of this miserable place . We won 't have to use this company as a front to hide our research anymore . We 're gonna work in a hi-tech laboratory . With real white lab coats . And lab assistants . With name tags . Grape juice ? Hmmm . Yes ! " Science has never been this much fun . " " These pets are sure to amaze . " I 'm ready to be amazed . " The water temperature must be more than 68 but less than 75 degrees . " Perfect . 72 degrees . Next , the eggs ... don 't let me down , boys . My summer rests on your little legs . Or whatever you got . Weird-looking things . Where 's the stirrer ? Guess a little of my hair won 't hurt . Now what ? " You should see some results within the next 48-72 hours " ? Two days ? Or less . Customer service . I need customer service . [ Ringing ] ocean pup . " You provide the water , we provide the fun . " Yeah , hi . My name 's william browning and i just used a kit i ordered- - was it satisfactory ? I don 't know . I mean i got flashing lights and water spouts- - lights and spouts ? Ok , mr . Browning , let me get my handbook . [ Both screaming ] aaah ! Mr. Browning , there 's nothing in the handbook relating to your particular problem . What ? ! Well , i 've done an exhaustive search through all of our databases . I also checked the indexes of earlier manuals for our kit- - what ? ! I even consulted our research department and they confirmed that the handbook doesn 't say anything about lights and spouts . Don 't ! No , it don 't . Maybe you could describe your problem again . No . Put it down . No ? No ! Sir , are you there ? Yep . I 'm here . Sir , hello ? Gotta go . Love your kit . Bye . We gotta talk . For starters ... put that on . No . Not like that . Like ... that . You look just like me . Me ? You speak ? Speak ? This is too weird . What 's going on ? I mean , where 'd you come from ? Miss pinkerson talked about something like this in science class . " Cloning : the creation by laboratory technique of an organism that is an identical copy of its parent . " Holy " a " in science class ! I made myself a clone ! The greatest science project ever ! " The science of cloning is still in its infancy . " You can read ? Intense . My parents are home . All right , listen up . In a few minutes i 'm gonna have to go downstairs and scarf some dinner . Scarf ? Eat . Consume . It 's all in there . Read about it . And stay here . Put on some clothes . Put on some clothes . Keep quiet . And keep quiet . Shhh . It was a strange phone call . I mean , the kid , he sounded so strange . I thought it was worth saying something . I don 't know what you guys are doing in there , anyway . I told you we should 've gotten rid of these animals ! Game over , pal . That 's it . Our secret 's out . Poof . Gone . Gone to some kid named ... will browning . The kid just got a weird reaction . It doesn 't mean anything . What if he accidentally clones something ? His dog or his cat ? We don 't have patents , remember ? " We don 't need them yet , " you said . " No one will ever find out about hypercloning , " you said . Feel better ? Much better . Sorry about that . So what 's our next move ? We 're taking a road trip . Well , will , what 's the science project you 've been working on ? I 'd rather not say . I don 't want to jinx it . Ha . Ding , ding , ding . That means , for our home viewing audience , that will isn 't working on any project at all . I happen to be working very hard on one . Done ! Done . We have a winner and a new champion . And here are your prizes . A brand new refrigerator , a brand new freezer- - yeah , cranking it up on the dark side is the new shawn peak kicker , with his latest fabled addition to his multi , multi-platinum catalog . Now stay in there , little bigbees . Bigbee . We 've got lots more hits coming your way . [ Both screaming ] what ? What 's wrong ? Uh , nothing . I 'm fine . Will , you screamed . Screaming implies something bad . No , i just screamed . A little . May i be excused ? Before dessert ? I made rutabaga popsicles . Tempting , but can i go ? Hello ? Where are you ? What are you doing down there ? Who 's that ? That ? It 's just a mask . It 's not real . See ? Oooooh . Grrrrr . It 's fake . Just pretend . For halloween . It scared me . I screamed . Whoa . Talk about scary . The underwear goes in the inside . And you gotta kill the tie . Kill it ? Take it off . Lose it . You know , i screamed too . At dinner . Well , why did you scream ? You know how twins can supposedly communicate psychically or something ? No . Yeah , well ... never mind . What were you doing in the closet , anyway ? I told you to look at the book . I finished that book . You read the whole thing ? No way . Yes way . The chapter on the classification of matter- - intense . All right , tell me about azurite . Azurite . A blue mineral with the formula cu3 ( oh ) 2 ( c03 ) 2 . It is often associated with the green mineral malachite , since they 've both been used as pigments and as gemstones . You 're a genus ! Now what ? I need to scarf . Oh , right . I mean , you must be hungry , being new to the planet , and all . I 'll get you some food . It 'll only take a second . So stay right here . Will ? What do you call this ? It 's a picture of my family . And my family ? No . My family . Although , if you want ' em ... now get back in my room . I 've got to keep you hidden until i know what i 'm gonna do with you . Allana : you better not be in the bathroom . My sister ! Come on . And stop talking to yourself , dip boy . You 're not that interesting . Shhh . Quiet . C 'mon , c 'mon . Stay close . Follow me . Honey , this calculator 's dying on me . Batteries are in the utility room . Right hand door . Get over there . Pssst . C 'mon . Find ' em ? Found them . Oh , no . Oh . Hi , will . How 's it goin ' ? Fine . Aah ! Weren 't you just ... why are you ... didn 't you ... weren 't you just wearing- - no , no . I 'm just ... honey , could you just ... open the fridge door ? Please ? Where are you going ? To the kitchen . Why ? To get a snack . You just ate dinner . I 'm hungry . Snacks are bad for you . Are you kidding ? With your mother 's cooking , snacks are what keep me alive . Right . Excuse me . Ooh . Of course you can . I 'll just reheat it . What are you trying to do ? Just stay with me . Wait a second . Weren 't ... what 's your mother putting in this food , anyway ? Upstairs . My room . Go . Oh , cholesterol . Sweetheart ... hi , honey . Will ? Honey , what are you doing down there ? I ... dropped a ... thing . I 'll be leaving now . Just , uh , eating some ... yummy leftovers . Yummy . It 's even better cold . Sucking up to mom to save your life when your grades tank ? I know what you 're up to . Allana , you can 't begin to fathom what i 'm up to . Hmmm . Enjoy that , huh ? Uh-huh . I guess it takes all kinds . [ Burps ] i 'm losing air . That was a burp . A belch . Perfectly normal . You 've got no leaks . Watch ... [ burps ] see ? Anything you want to know about bodily functions , just ask . [ Yawns ] what was that ? A yawn . It means you 're tired . All that running around must 've gotten to you . You 've had a big day . Was it a big day for you too ? The biggest day of my life , so far . Even bigger than when i got my tonsils removed . The tonsils play no part in the human body . They and the spleen are the only organs that can be removed with no concern . That 's what your book said . It 's so amazing . You look like me , you talk like me , but you have a computer brain . It 's your brain too . It 's gotta be . I 'm your clone . Hey , whatta i call you ? The other me ? Will two ? Twoie ? Twoie . Twoie ? William ? [ Knocking ] honey , are you asleep already ? I love you , sweetheart . Goodnight . She thought you were me . I am such a genius . Get some sleep , my friend . 'Cause come monday , you 're not going to school as my science project , you 're going to school as me . [ Sighs ] oh ! Don 't tell me we 're actually here . You and your computer maps . I 'm not in the mood . So let 's just raid the place and figure out what the kid cloned . [ Blows horn ] two words- - breaking and entering . They 're bad when you use them together . First , we observe . Observe ? We drove halfway across the country to observe ? Observe what ? We look for two of anything . Two poodles , two house cats , two hamsters ... where are we going now ? To load up on coffee and poorly prepared fast food . We are on a stakeout . A family of grizzly bears has chosen this spot to test the fishing . The family unit is essential to the survival of the cubs , who are just beginning to explore the world around them . Somebody say amen . Amen ! Amen ! Amen ! Did i hear you shout " amen " ? Maybe . Well , we 're waiting for you , so hurry up . All right , now listen up . I 've gotta go visit grandpa mordechai in the nursing home . He 's your family ? Yep . Old , old , old family . Family is good . The family unit is essential to the survival of the cubs . The family units are what send you to boot camp . I 'll be back in a few hours . Just watch tv . Family . Like the grizzly bear , i must explore the world around me . Hi , dad . Hey , mordechai . How ya doin ' today ? We brought the kids along , mordechai . Hi , grandpa . Hi , gramps . He 's in his zone again . Twoie ? Twoie ? Ok , think . Where could he be ? Hey , can i play ? Can i play ? Grass ... picnics . The park ! All right , go get it . Nice catch ! All right , bring it here , boy . Hey , can i play ? Mom ! Twoie . Twoie ! Hi . Isn 't this place great ? I told you not to leave the house . You said , " watch tv . " I did that . You gotta start using your head ! I couldn 't find you . How did you know i was here ? It just came to me . Like when you were scared and i screamed . Same thing . Do i have a family ? No , i have a family . You ... you 're just a clone . Let 's get outta here . Stay a block behind me , then wait in the garage till i get you . I 've got to start teaching you the fine art of being me . Now , show me the walk . Ok . Let 's see some attitude this time . How was that ? Up ... down ... yooo ! Ow . Ray corning . He 's in math class . He smells like cabbage . Next , scottie desota . We got him suspended . We don 't like him . Very good . You 'll be ok . All right , high five . Oops . Sorry . My fault . No , no , no . You don 't just walk up to girls and say , hey , baby . But the man on television did . That was an old movie . Didn 't you notice it was in black and white ? You mean new york city doesn 't look like that ? Sometimes you sound so smart , i 'm afraid you 're gonna make me look like a geek . And sometimes ... i 'm sorry , will . I 'm really trying . My sister ! Twoie ! Twoie ! Uuh ! What are you trying to do , give me a heart attack ? What 's your malfunction , toad ? Dark . What ? You are multi , multi , all the way to the peak kicker . You are one crankin' little bigbee . All the way to the fabled addition . Oh , i just hope i 'm around when you do that in public . How did a clone like you know stuff like that ? A thing called a music video . Yeah , well , you 've got to learn to keep that stuff to yourself . I mean , she laughed at you . That was the worst . Why is that the worst ? Why ? Well ... because it is . Trust me . Now we 've still got a lot of work ahead of us . Who 's this next to me ? Chuckie . He 's my best friend . Who 's this on the other side ? Heather johnson . She 's got a righteous crush on me . Perfect . Now , my mom 's in the kitchen . Cruise through . Say , gotta go . Give my mom a kiss , go out the door . Gotta go , kiss , out the door . Got it ? Got it . Hang it over one shoulder . Will , honey , i made sprout muffins for breakfast . Gotta go . Kiss . Out the door . What did you say ? Gotta go . Kiss . Out the door . He 's gotta be from a different gene pool . Will ! Hey , buddy . Chuckie ? I mean , chuckie . Hey , what happened to you this weekend ? I called a few times but you never called back . What were you , busy ? Yeah , busy . And now i feel like something 's crawling in my stomach . Did you eat something bad ? No , i just feel strange . Nervous , excited . You sure you 're ok ? Sure , peak kicker to the max . Ok , then . So far , so good . This place looks great . Why do i hate it so much ? Maybe because you 're constantly on the verge of failing every subject .

Not as big as the trouble you 're gonna be in when i get you alone one of these days . You 're still mad about me getting you suspended . But it wasn 't right of you to steal my lunch money . What did you say ? Although i shouldn 't have been afraid to talk to you myself . Rather than telling a teacher . I mean , there 's nothing to be afraid of , right ? Yeah . Right . I 'm sorry . But i should 've been braver . Dude , there 's something seriously wrong with you today . So , what did you do to get here ? I started a riot in the lunch room . That was you ? I bet your old man 's gonna go medieval on you , huh ? Old man ? I mean , like , your dad . My dad ? Your father , stupid . I mean , you do have a father , right ? I don 't really know what it means to have a father . My dad left me and my mom when i was two . I don 't really know what it means to have a father , either . You know what , browning ? You 're all right , man . [ Bell rings ] guess who 's been practicing . So , how 'd it go ? Tell me everything . Oh , it was great . I made lots of friends . I love school . I want to go again tomorrow . My friend , you have my permission to go every day until the end of the year . What are you doin ' ? Our homework . Am i a genius or what ? [ Phone rings ] hello . Hi , will . It 's heather . Heather ? What are you planning on wearing ? Wearing to what ? Wearing to the social , silly . The social ? You know , next weekend . Heather , i 've gotta go take care of something . I 'll call you back . You invited her to the social ? ! No , she invited me . Uugh ! It doesn 't mean you have to say yes ! She 's bringing pizza . Six years spent avoiding heather johnson destroyed in one day . [ Doorbell rings ] stay here . Don 't talk to anyone . If the phone rings , don 't answer it . Stay ! [ Both scream ] got something for you , browning . You left this at the principal 's office . I did ? Yeah . Thought i 'd drop it off for you . You did ? It was cool talking to you today , man . It was ? I 'll catch you tomorrow , browning . You will ? What was with that weirdness today at lunch , dough brain ? You have to teach me that dance , ok ? Everybody 's been asking me where you learned it . I 'm kind of like a celebrity sister . Mike carmichael even asked me out . What is going on around here ? Excuse me . Are you william browning ? Who wants to know ? Uh , we 're from the ocean pups company . And , uh , we 're ... we 're here ... here . Responding to your call . Responding to your call of a few days ago . That 's right . Oh , that 's nice of you . It was nothing , really . Uh , well , we understand that , uh , that your kit- - you experienced some strange reaction . Weird things going on ? No , it wasn 't that strange . Look , we 're here to help you . Yeah . So just tell us everything , and help us help you . No , really . Everything 's fine . The kit was lame . I don 't need your help , but i 'd take a refund . Uh ... well , we 'll get back to you on that . Yeah , we 'll have to do that . I 'm kinda busy helping my dad in the backyard . Dad , i 'll be right there ! Oh , no , that 's fine . We 're sorry to have bothered you , and bye . Ok . Do you think the kid 's telling the truth ? Think ? I don 't need to think . This device analyzes voice patterns and creates a detailed profile of whatever subject i 'm studying . And according to this , will browning is ... a nervous , four-foot-tall , rabid chimpanzee . Let 's just get outta here , ok ? Whatever it is he 's cloned in there , after three weeks , it 'll be history . The built-in lifespan will end . Hasta la vista . No more hyperclone . Our problems will be solved . No , no , no . I 'm not going anywhere until i find out exactly what he 's cloned . Now we 're already committed a tactical breech by announcing our presence . If we want to continue with this stakeout , we need to blend in a little more . We need ... camouflage . Will : check out what 's in that van ! Looks like the cia just arrived . What is all that ? Electronic stuff , like for spying or something . I 've got a feeling those guys are into a lot more than ocean pups . Whatta ya mean ? I kind of used an ocean pups kit , but instead of getting ocean pups , i got you . You think they 're here for me ? Hey , relax . We 've just got to keep an eye on ' em , that 's all . Can i still leave the house ? Hey , we 're talking about my grades here . You still like school , don 't you ? Totally . Good . After you get my butt out of summer boot camp , you can go back under cover . But now , the main thing is , you and i can never , ever , ever be seen together by anyone . Especially those guys . Deal ? Deal . Will , awesome job on this exam . " A + " ! We 're so proud of you , honey . [ Yawns ] whoa ! Sorry . Hey ! Ok . I 've read this one , already . Like six times . You 're late . Where were you ? Oh , chuckie and i went out for pizza with scottie desota . I brought you back a slice . A slice of pizza ? I 've been living like a prisoner here , and you bring me back a slice of pizza ? I 'm just doing what you asked me to , will . You did think this up . Yeah , and if your grades weren 't so good i 'd un-think this up right now . I 'm sorry you 're so upset . I wish i had time to talk about it . What do you mean ? Oh , chuckie and i are meeting heather and some of the kids down at the arcade . Forget it . You 're staying here . I 'm going . I think i deserve to have a little fun too . Why ? Why ? Why ? That 's what you do all day is have fun . I 'm the one that does all the work around here . Fine . Go . Whatever . Look , will , i thought staying home all day , eating junk food , watching television , and not going to school was your dream . It was my dream . My dream stinks . $ 200 for the ice cream truck rental . Fifty bucks for a portable freezer . We weren 't doing so bad . We would have broken even in a couple of months . I didn 't come here to start a small business . Not to mention the fact we didn 't get any spying done . Conrad , when hypercloning hits it big , we 're gonna look back at all this and laugh . My island we buy with all that money . I want a little ranch house , a picket fence , fluffy white pillows . It 's not possible . Which part ? Look , look , look , look . Down on the driveway . What 's up , man ? Victor : the bedroom window . One there , one there . Two of them ! Two will brownings ! Both : he 's hypercloned himself ! A human hyperclone ! Conrad , do you know what this means ? If we grab hold of that specimen and run some tests , we 'll be able to hyperclone humans . This is the greatest day of our lives ! Now all we have to do is figure out which will is will and which will is the clone . Why don 't we just grab them both ? No . That 's kidnapping . Whereas , the last time i checked , there were no laws against clonenapping . So we wait until the clone is alone . Exactly . We 've still got three days . You sure you want me to do this ? Hey , if you can hang out with my friends at the arcade , you can hang out with grandpa mordechai . Besides , it 's just for a couple of hours . Just act more or less normal and you 'll be fine . Grandpa mordechai is your family . Today he 's all yours . You 'll love him . He 's a load of laughs . Is that what old looks like ? That 's what very old looks like . All right , let 's just go watch television with mordechai . Hi , dad . Look who came to see you . Hi , mordechai . Hi , grandpa . Go on , dufus . Say hi . Does it hurt ? Being old ? Not today . Will ? What took you so long ? Tell me you didn 't mess anything up . You were right about grandpa mordechai . He 's a lot of fun . We had a long talk . Grandpa mordechai doesn 't talk to anyone . He talked to me . [ Knocking ] will , can we come in ? Oh , you changed your clothes . Yes . Yes , i did . Honey , your dad and i just wanted you to know that that was the sweetest thing you have ever done . It meant so much to me , you being nice to grandpa . You know how much family means to me . Anyway , i just wanted you to know you are a very special person . Don 't you ever forget that . And i want you to know that your mother and i are very impressed with you lately . I mean , the changes you 've made at school , and your grades are up , your attitude 's improved . It 's like you 're a different kid . I guess we got through to you . And since the changes happened with you so fast , summer boot camp is not an issue anymore . The summer is yours . Do anything you want . Goof off , hang out around with chuckie , anything . You deserve it . What if ... the new me was only temporary ? What if i went back to how i used to be ? You 'd still love me ... right ? Honey , loving you was never the question . C 'mon , you knew that , didn 't you ? Huh ? Where do you think you 're going ? Um , to school ? Not today . I 'm going . You 're staying here . Do not leave this room . Uh , will ... maybe i should fill you in on what 's going on in school . Things are a little different now . You know , with your friends and everything . I think i can figure out how to talk to my friends in my school , ok ? Ok . The nerve of that guy . " Maybe i should fill you in on what 's going on . " Please . Looks like his clone head is getting a little swelled . Hey , there 's will ! What 's going on , will ? Hi , will . Hi . My friends , my life . Hi , will . Thanks so much for helping me rearrange my room . It was so nice of you to stay late . This is my school , not his . Will ! Chuckie , did i really stay after school and help miss pinkerson move her furniture ? Don 't you remember ? Sure , i do . I just don 't remember why . Why ? 'Cause it 's you , man . You give . You 're always up for new things . In these last couple of weeks you 've become pretty , ah ... i guess the word i 'm lookin ' for is popular . Yeah . Right . Will , my man . My mom scored some tickets to sunday 's ball game . Right behind home plate . Wanna come ? Sure . Hey ! Looks like you have some cleaning up to do . But it was an accident . Grip it , punk . And pick it up . Sorry . I 'm so sorry . Thanks , buddy . So , think about the game . We 'll talk about it at lunch . Save your seat ? Thanks . Cool . See you later . You too , dude . Will ? You ok ? What time do you want to meet tonight ? Tonight ? The junior social , remember , silly ? No , heather , i forgot . Duh . How 's 7 : 00 ? I wanna be there early- - so we can talk and stuff . It 's settled then . 7 : 00 in the gym . See ya later , william . I 'll see ya ... william . Oh , man . What happened to my life ? Twoie ? Tell me you 're in here . I realized you were making very poor use of your available shelf and closet space , so i increased the total storage capacity of your room by 12.4 cubic feet . Want to see the chart ? No . Thanks . You 're mad . Wow . You 're absolutely brilliant . You sure you have my genes ? Every last one of ' em . Then how come you get " a " s ? How come grandpa mordechai talked to you ? How could all of this have happened for you but never for me ? You 're me , aren 't you ? Of course i 'm you . I 'm no better or worse . Yeah . Well , everyone thinks you 're better . No . Everyone thinks you 're better . No one knows about me . What do you do that 's different ? I try hard . And i 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid of anything . I think you pretend not to care about grades and all . But really , i think you don 't try because you 're afraid you might not do so well . Oh , come on ! And it 's not just grades . If i want to do something like dance , i dance . I don 't care if people laugh at me . You do . Why don 't you care ? Why should i ? I 'm not hurting anyone . I 'm just being me . If people like me for that- - great . And if they don 't- - well then , there 's a lot of other people out there who i can be friends with . All i know is that you 've messed up my life . You didn 't like school today ? I did . That 's the problem . And now , everyone 's expecting you tonight at the junior social . And they 're gonna get me . I should have let you get me a few good grades , then taken you to the mall and dumped you . You 're right . I am ? I 've thought about this more and more , and i don 't belong here . This is your family , not mine . Twoie , i--i- - i was thinkin ' , if you don 't mind , maybe i 'll go to new york city . See if it really is black and white . But- - i 've decided , will . I 'm leaving tonight . Look , there 's that junior social thing . I was gonna go , but maybe you should go instead . See everyone and hang out with them for one last time . This is a big night for all of us . You , at your dance . Us , taking grandpa mordechai to a movie . Ok . Ok . How about a big smile for posterity , huh ? Look at you . I remember my first dance . I was so nervous . Something about a school dance . [ Drinking straw gurgling ] there 's that static again . There we go . Look . There 's one of ' em . Let 's go ! Good-bye , twoie . Hey , will ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Why did you stop me ? How 's it goin ' ? We don 't want any witnesses . Besides , did you see how he was dressed ? He 's going to that school dance . That 's the real will browning . We don 't have time for speculation , victor . Either the clone drinks this tonight , or he turns into ocean pup eggs in the morning . Ocean pup eggs . Well , you 're the one that put the four-week lifespan on it . Security precaution . Yeah . Well , at least we know that the hyperclone is somewhere in the browning house . Right ? Umm . Gimme that . Gimme ! I want it . The clone ! The clone ! Ok . He 's gone . We know where the real will browning is . We 'll grab him . Pump him for info . Where there 's a will , there 's a way .

I 've never seem anything so ... white ... and so sparkily . ♪ ♪ hi , will . I brought the pizza . Wow . Thanks . This is gonna be great . How come no one 's dancing ? Come on , man . You know no one wants to be the first geek on the dance floor . Where are you going ? Come on . Browning needs backup . Heeey ! Hey , dude . Will you hold this for a second ? I 'll be right back . Great . I can 't even be mad at him . Yeah . Where are you going ? Uh , i 'll be right back . Maybe i can show you guys a new dance step . Will , why 'd you change ? And how 'd you do it so fast ? I didn 't change . It was never me . It was my clone . You 're somethin ' else . I mean , i asked you why you changed your clothes , and you 've gotta come up with " that was my clone . " Man , you crack me up . Listen to me ! You 're not going to want to believe this , but it 's true . So i need your help . Ok ? You 're doin ' it again , man . You 're beginning to freak me out . I haven 't even started . Uh-oh . What ? Let 's move . We 'll walk and talk . What the ... gold leader to blue one . I have a visual . Wait . I thought i was gold leader . Over by the dj . It 's the hyperclone . We got him . Time to go . Hi , will . I thought you might be thirsty after all that dancing . Nice clothes . Much more you . So , you promised us a new dance step . I did ?

Twelve o 'clock high . This way . Hey , will . You 're not in the bathroom . I mean , he 's not in there . I mean , what do i mean ? Wait a second . What are you doing ? Sometimes we can communicate psychically . You know . We can hear each other 's thoughts . If one of us is really stressed or something . Shoot ! Nothing . That 's it . You 're making all this up . I know it . Chuckie , you 've gotta trust me ! Look in the gym . Then go to my house . You take the shortcut . I 'll take the long way . That way if he 's out there one of us will find him . This is one heck of a junior social . Hey ! Gotcha ! Hello , my little hyperclone . Lemme- - lemme go ! Bus now boarding for new york city . Now boarding for new york city . Help ! Help ! Help !

Yeah , well , you got the wrong one ! I 'm the real will . Yeah ! All right now . If you 'll let me go right now , i won 't tell anyone about you , ok ? Would you excuse us for a moment , please ? Yeah . What if he 's telling the truth ? If we give a normal kid the serum , no telling what might happen . I think we have to get the other one . Run some tests . That 's the only way we can be sure . Oh , yeah . Check the ropes . Gotta keep this one here . Ok . Don 't go away . Help ! Somebody , help me ! Big trouble . I 'm in big trouble . If i ever get outta here , i- - twoie was right . What was i waiting for ? Now i 'll never get a chance to dance , or see chuckie or heather , even . Or allana , or mom and dad . I love my mom and dad . I can 't believe it . I miss my family . Tell me about it . Twoie ! In the flesh . I was at the bus station , and i knew you were scared . And then the name red jack motors flashed in my head . You came back for me . Why are you so surprised ? You should be mad at me . Will , if it wasn 't for you , i wouldn 't have ever tasted pizza . I owe you one . Twoie , i gotta tell you something . If you don 't drink some special liquid those creeps in the van have , you might turn back into ocean pup eggs . That 's why i 've been feeling so weird . We 've gotta get it back from them . Well , that was stupid , conrad . Come on ! " We don 't need gas , " you said . " It runs for three miles on empty , " you said . He 's gone . All right . He 's gotta be in here . No way out . Right . [ Whistles ] we better split up . Come on ! Well , well , well . Looks like we finally got our hyperclone . I 'm will . We switched clothes . I don 't think so . You don 't need to be afraid . We 've got your best interest at heart . You need us .

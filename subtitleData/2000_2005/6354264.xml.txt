 The Bible says God appeared to Moses in a burning bush . He came to Jesus on a mountaintop . For Buddha , God came while he sat under a tree . God came to me in a vision in the desert ... February 26 , 1991 . My recon squad had engaged Saddam 's army in a small Bedouin encampment . We 'd been ambushed ... taken all by surprise , and there were casualties . - I can 't feel my legs ! - You 're gonna be okay . - Don 't worry . - My legs ! Damn it , get on the radio ! We need some help here ! Zulu Six Two , we are under attack . Repeat : We are under attack . We are taking heavy machine-gun fire . We were holding our perimeter , and we might 've held up ... but on this day , I had a terrible sense of foreboding . I saw the future of those brave men ... and they were about to die . Death came to take my men ... but not me . I was left as a witness to a vision . Angels from heaven . Behold , a whirlwind came out of the north and a brightness was about it . And out of the midst came the likeness of four living creatures ... and they had the likeness of a man . I knew why my life had been spared . I was to deliver the message of these angels ... of these sons of God . To deliver the message of the god who came before all other gods . At 7 : 00 this evening , in a Washington D.C. Alley ... a vehicle carrying the son of Agent Dana Scully ... was forced to a violent stop by a female shooter ... who proceeded to kidnap the child at gunpoint . The van was being driven by three men ... asked by Agent Scully to protect the child . The three men are currently working to I.D. The assailant . John Doggett was seriously injured ... by the same female shooter as he tried to halt her vehicle . Agent Doggett remains in a coma under close watch ... at St. Mary 's Hospital . This kidnapping follows on the heels of a failed attack ... on Scully 's child by another FBI agent , Robert Comer . He remains in critical condition ... also at St. Mary 's . Now , this man 's motives ... and the motives of the female kidnapper ... are still unknown . Let me emphasize that the FBI has no reason to believe ... that it cannot affect the safe return of Agent Scully 's child . Agent Scully . What are you doing ? I thought I told you you didn 't need to be here . I just had to see this for myself . Go home . To what ? I 'm just saying , you don 't need ... to put yourself through this , Dana . We 've got every stop pulled : Every available agent working to find your son . And A.D. Brad Follmer leading the charge . Deputy Director Kersh asked him to take the lead . He knows how to run a task force . I think you see that in there . I see a man who withholds information for Kersh . A man who not once but twice ... failed to prevent an attack on my son . You see a task force in there . I see a whitewash . I know you 're upset ... but you can 't possibly accuse Follmer or Kersh ... of having any part in this . What is it going to take for you ? How many people have to be taken out ... for you to open your eyes to it ? My son ... Agent Doggett ... Mulder . Kersh protected you ... by not telling you reports of Mulder 's death . As did Follmer . As did I. You call it protection . I call it a systematic effort inside the FBI ... to eliminate us . You accuse anyone of anything in the FBI ... you have to accuse me along with them . Scully , where are you going ? To find my son . Hi . Hi . His hands are so cold . Have you talked to the doctors yet ? They say the good news is that there 's no swelling of the brain ... but they were very frank that he could just never wake up . I wonder if he can hear us . There 'd be soldiers in Vietnam ... bodies turned inside out . I 'd hold their hands just like you 're doing . Tell them it was going to be okay . Do you think it helped ? Talking to them ? Well , I always thought it was like ... like praying . Even if they can 't hear ... maybe ... God can . Hello . How 's he doing ? No change . I need to see you right away , Monica . Are you alone right now ? Skinner 's here with me . I 'd prefer if Skinner didn 't know . We found her . Who ? The woman that took William . She 's a wanted felon and a part of the UFO cult ... that the FBI was investigating . I need anything that you can find on her , Monica ... but I need you to get it quietly . " Access denied " ? Yeah , we 'll see about that . If they I.D. ' d the woman ... then why isn 't the FBI investigating it ? I asked them not to tell the FBI . What are you doing , Dana ? I 'm trying to get my son back . - We 're locked on . - Like there was ever a doubt . Which brings us that much closer to finding William . Langly 's inside the system . I 'm hacked inside the phone company . Going to use their mainframe ... to scan the map for a locator signal . Before William was kidnapped , Byers was able ... to tuck a cell phone under the padding of the baby 's car seat . Call the phone , and Langly ... can use the signal to find its location . Find the phone , find the baby . You mean , assuming the kidnapper hasn 't found the phone . We 'll keep trying . This is madness , and you know it . They failed you once with your child . They 're going to fail you again . Then I 'll find him myself . You can 't do this alone . Look , what alternative do I have ... when the FBI is all but telling me ... they think that my son is already dead ? We 've got a signal ... in Warfordsburg , Pennsylvania ... off the interstate . You coming with me ? Or am I going alone ? Have you got him ? Yes . He 's safe . We 're here . We need to go carefully now . I want you to stay where you are . I 'm sending someone to get you , all right ? Yes . It 's moving . It 's moving ! Can you hear me ? We need some tools . Go get some tools ! Come on , move it ! Federal agent ! John Doggett ... where is he ? He 's not in his bed . They 've taken him down to Radiology ... to run a CAT scan . Would you like me to call down to his doctor ? No . No , I was just worried . I 'm sorry . What ? Nothing . I 've known you a long time ... and this just seems , uh ... a little traditional for you . Maybe when you 're lost ... you knock at the door with the porch light on . Hey , hey . I want you to know , I 'm doing all I can ... to find the woman who did this . Even though we got people inside the FBI ... working against us . It was foolish going after her by yourselves . We could have been there ... long before you , Monica . Could have even captured the suspect . Instead , she got away . This is complicated , Brad . If you came in here to bust me ... No . No . I came here to ask for your cooperation . Not sharing information ... creates an atmosphere of distrust ... and then I 'm less apt ... to share my information with you . What haven 't you shared with me ? This FBI agent who tried to kill Scully 's baby ... has come around . He 's got something he wants to tell us . What ? I need your cooperation . You said he tried to tell you something . How is that possible ? He didn 't tell me exactly . He wrote it down . I don 't know what this means . I don 't know either . But it means something . And I want to know what . Just tell me where you got this . You know what it means ? Robert Comer wrote this , didn 't he ? The FBI agent who tried to kill my son . And how did you get it ? I got it under the condition ... that I share what I learn from you . Take it . What is it ? What does it mean ? If I don 't tell you ... you 're good on your word , right ? That means that you 've learned ... absolutely nothing from me . Where are you going ? To the hospital . Hey , it doesn 't work that way . Look , this began when the agent lying in that hospital ... crashed his motorcycle running the border from Canada . Somehow , he got to Washington without a scratch ... and he tried to kill my son . Now , tell me , how did he do that , Monica ? With something ... I found in his jacket pocket ... in a jacket that he wore to my house that I put three shots in . The artifact ... a piece of the ship . Let go . Oh , my God . Let go of my hand . Turn off the monitors , or they 're going to alert somebody . Now tell me who sent you to kill my son ... or I will take that pillow from under your head ... and make them the last breaths that you take . Your son has to die . I 'm not what you think . Please ... Please ... The FBI sent me undercover ... on a man named Josepho to get inside his cult ... whose followers believe an alien race will rule the world . One day , God told Josepho to lead us a thousand miles north ... to find a ship buried in the ground . You have a piece of that ship in your hand . Josepho believes ... that that ship is a temple ... which houses the physical manifestation of God . Are you saying ... that God asked you to kill my child ? No . Josepho said God spoke to him of a miracle child . A future savior coveted by forces of good and evil . Josepho believes your son is this child . Then why does he want to kill him ? He doesn 't . He wants to protect him . Josepho believes your son will follow ... in his father 's paths and try and stop the aliens ' return . Unless his father ... was to be killed . That is the prophecy . You came here to kill her son ... against this man and his cult ? To stop them ? Are you saying you believe this prophecy but acted alone ? What he 's saying is that Mulder is dead . That that 's true . That they killed him to fulfill this prophecy . And that your son must die too . Or everyone ... all of mankind will perish from Earth . Please ... Please , let me ... Please ... Please ... What is going on here ? What are you doing in here ? They turned off all the monitors . They removed his intubation . What are you doing in here ? This patient does not need support . He 's breathing on his own . Step outside . Both of you . Let 's go . Get me A.D. S Follmer and Skinner . It 's not working . You weren 't followed ? No . He 's safe now . He 's safe with us . Where are Scully and Reyes ? They were told to wait out here . Assistant Director ... we need Scully and Reyes , now . What are we going to tell them ? Who ? The FBI about Agent Comer . About what just happened . About how he was healed . Just tell them the truth . They 're not on our side . They will use the truth against us . Dana , you don 't believe what you heard in there . You don 't believe what that man was telling you . How can you doubt him ? I mean , after everything that you 've just witnessed . After what you saw with my son . I mean , it 's-it 's exactly what I feared ... that there 's something terribly wrong ... from the very moment that he was conceived . Your child was a miracle , Dana . I don 't doubt that the things I 've witnessed ... are any less miraculous . But your son is not an abomination ... a thing that should cease to exist . You tell me on that ship is written scripture ... from the world 's great religions . Tell me a religion ... that decrees the death of a child . Not just your child , but any child . This is a man saying these things to us . How many religions warn of false prophets ? Men sent to deceive us ? The only thing that I believe ... is that your son may still be alive ... and we can find him and save him . And with that object in that room ... we can save Agent Doggett too . You two better get out of here . Agent Comer 's dead . What ? This man was alive . You saw him . He was alive . Somebody was in here . Where did it go ? Where did what go ? This man had something in his hand . A small piece of metal . It 's what revived him . L-It 's why he could be taken off life support . A piece of metal ? I don 't know what she 's talking about . Who else came into this room ? Why are you questioning me ? Did you leave the room ? Agent Reyes . This woman came in here , and this man was alive . He was more than alive . He 'd been healed . He 'd been brought back to life . This man was murdered , but it wasn 't by us . Agent Reyes . Who else was in here ? You were in here . I came in and found you . Were you alone in here ? Was he alone in here ? She went to get the doctors . Search this man . For what ? Monica ! Scully saw it . Ask Agent Scully . Agent Scully ... Where 's Scully ? Agent Scully . I never meant for this . All that 's been lost . I never meant to put you at risk ... to risk losing you too . She 's fighting for you . Monica 's out there trying to find a way . And she 's not going to let you go . Agent Scully . Agent Doggett . Oh ! I heard someone talking . Yeah , that was me . That was me talking to you . No , it wasn 't you . They 're going to come to you , but you can 't trust them . Do you understand that ? Scully . Oh , my God . Scully . Listen carefully , Agent Scully . You want to see your son ? You come alone ... and you follow my instructions to the letter . Sorry to keep you waiting ... but I had to make sure you were alone . I only wish to protect the boy ... from those who 'd harm him . He 's a very special boy . I came here to take him back . " Behold , a whirlwind came out of the north ... " and a brightness was about it . " And out of the midst ... " came the likeness of four living creatures ... and they had the likeness of a man . " That 's the Bible . Did you know it ? Ephesians . The Bible ... describing giants who walk the earth . Who 'd believe it ? Only the faithful ... and we who have seen them . These ... Super Soldiers . The true sons of God . I want to see my son . You struggle to believe . It 's so incredible ... but your son will lead this alien race . He was put here to lead . I 'll bring you to him , to see your son . After you do something for me . After you bring something I need . Confirmation that Mulder 's dead . You killed Mulder ? No . I believed he was dead ... but now I have reason to doubt that . And if he 's alive ... he 's the one thing preventing your son 's true destiny . You told me I could see my son . You lied . If you want to see the boy ... you 'll bring me the head of Fox Mulder . Get ready , Monica . Hold on . His car is wired . Here we go . They say he 's about a mile ahead , turning off the highway . What about these hills ? Are we going to lose him in these hills ? Yeah , yeah . How are we in terrain ? That transponder will track this guy ... driving under water to Brazil . Langly . What just happened ? We 're coming to a turn . Is this it ? Uh , yeah . Turn . I think they lost the signal . They have to get it back . Piece of crap ! Hey , louder , why don 't you ? Tell them we 're working on it . Here , you be the messenger . What is it ? What 's happening ? The baby started crying ... and it just came to life . Hey , guys , we lost him . And we just ran out of road out here . William ? William ! William ! No . Oh , my God ! Dana ... Oh , my ... William ? Oh , sweetie ! I came to give you a ride home . They told me you were in here . Yeah . I came in here and prayed for you . Yeah , I know . This voice in my head , it was ... it was talking to me ... telling me to get up ... telling me to warn Scully about this man . I mean ... was it you talking to me ? I only prayed for your life . - Uh , Deputy Director ? Mr. Follmer . Sir , it 's , um ... It 's about that report you have there . The investigation ... of Special Agent Robert Comer 's death . Yes ? As you know , A.D. Skinner refused to sign it ... believing that Agent Comer was murdered ... in his hospital bed . But you did sign it , isn 't that right , Mr. Follmer ? Finding nothing to support ... that allegation . Well , that 's just it , sir . I did find something . The monitors in Agent Comer 's room ... they recorded his condition moment by moment ... showing that his vital signs ... did improve just before his equipment was unplugged . They did , in fact ... return back to normal . And you have an explanation for that , yes ? No , sir , I don 't . And you want what ? I just want to take my name off it . Maybe if you weren 't so busy backpedaling , Mr. Follmer ... you might get me an explanation . Excuse me . I 'm sure you heard all of that . Congratulations . It would appear now ... that everything is dead but this case . I 'm sure I can take care of that , Deputy Director . Quite sure .

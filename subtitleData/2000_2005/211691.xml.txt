 " Fields of green grass " Well , mold is is green " Crystal blue streams " Ruptured boldox ... actually If I had anything at all in my stomach right now , I 'd throw up . Wow , never seen anything like it Moya could fit in its mouth . It 's the remains of a Budong . One of the largest creatures there is . Last month you 've been telling of this fantastic place where we 're gonna get fed . And this is it ? A big ... rotting ... budong ? You mean ... that thing 's edible ? budong flesh is ... kinda poisonous . Its got these postral things that are filled with acid ... Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Well , we 've got it , we got that one . It ain 't edible . What 's the matter with you ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I hope its not a cold , 'cause I 'm sure not gonna get any chicken soup on a budong . Look , I don 't know what cheken Zoop is but there 's plenty of other foods on the mine camp . What , people live on a budong ? Inside . Yeah Mining for negeltic crystals How 'd you find out about this place ? My brother Nerri and I stayed there for a while . We had a great time . Why 'd you leave then ? The winds blew in a different direction Really ? How much did you steal ? It was a long time ago . And they 're going to welcome the prodigal daughter home with a Thanksgiving meal . Look , we 'll work it out once we 're there . If they 've got food , let 's go . What is that appalling smell ? Breakfast . Dentics . You can 't eat Dentics ! Fried Dentics . You can eat anything if it 's fried . I 'll pass ! Suit yourself Jenny Craig , but I 'm hungry . Obviously ... not that hungry . I say we starburst out of here and try our luck somewhere else , Crichton . Aeryn . We are out of supplies . We 're gonna become the ' Donner Party' of the uncharted territories if we don 't get some food soon . Nobody is gonna starve . The colony has food . Chiana 's right . We must go to the mining camp . Of course I 'm right . No Zhaan . You obviously didn 't hear . Chiana has enemies that she forgot to tell us about . I need food ... now Zhaan , what 's going on ? Zhaan ? I must have food ... or I 'll die . My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Why Crichton , why ? Why do I have to stay aboard Moya ? Because , D 'Argo and I are allergic to whatever is happening to Zhaan , and you aren 't . You feeling all right ? You up for this ? I 'm not sure what 's worse , the hunger pains , or the frelling allergies ! What the dren are we waiting for ? Me Yotz ! Shazam ! That 's nice . You think this will catch Temmon 's eye ? Who 's Temmon ? Just an old friend . He 'll look after me . We 'll get food , don 't worry . Well , we better or Zhaan dies . Come one. lets go . Come on. lets go . Oh , that 's just great get to stay on board with the blooming blue bush , and you get to play with your favorite little trelk . We 'll be back in a couple of arns , tops . I hope the food tastes better than this place smells . What did you expect ? It 's a corpse . It 's a filthy Gelft sty ! Do you want food or not ? What about your friend ? Temmon Why didn 't you tell us about him before ? Is he edible ? Shut up , Rygel You did , didn 't you ? You stole from this guy . How 's this gonna go down ? When I tell him Nerri 's dead , he 'll forget all ... all about the money . You 're gonna use your dead brother ... to play on his sympathies ? I have a plan ! D 'Argo , its okay ... Chiana has a plan . An attack ! D 'Argo ! Crichton ! a Keedva ! Temmon frell This is who 's going to help us ? Temmon ... Temmon ... It 's me . Chiana Chian ... Chiana ... Don 't let me suffer like this ... Get ... B 'Soog . What the hezmana are you doing ! ? Once that stuff touches you , you 're dead anyway ! Chiana , what 's happening here ? He smack ... Ahhh ! Right into a pustule ! Keedva must have been after him . 'Keedva ' ... What exactly is a ' Keedva ' ? Vicious beast that feeds off the Budong , chews up anything that gets in the way . You did what needed to be done Chiana . As usual , these weaklings didn 't have the guts to put my brother out of this misery . Go home , all of you . I 'm closing the mine 'til I track that Keedva and kill it . But with the mines closed , how are these poor folk gonna earn enough Nogelti for provisions ? How are you gonna anything if you 're dead ? Now get out of here . I 'm gone . Never thought I 'd see you again . You got some nerve . Temmon used to say you , ah ... you liked my nerve . That wasn 't all I liked . Too bad you left so suddenly . Why are you back ? Our ship 's out of food . We 're dying of starvation . I thought you could help us out . You want food ? Hand over your weapons . No . Then stay hungry . Here you are marshal . I 'll feed your friends , but not you Chiana . You used up my charity . Go ... get food for ZHAAN . Altana ! Alive and kickin ' ... Come on girl , I 'll give you feed . So what 's Desdi Girl been up to ? A Keedva got her just after you left . She lost both her arms and half her face . True God . Tara ... gave it up She bugged out She got some kids or something now . True ? What about Jav ? Scored big and ... left , just like I 'm about to . Hey girl , you 've been here too long . You 've been waiting your whole life on that big score . No good No more girl . I 'm leaving , because I did hit it big ... You better shut it before something you won 't like flies in . before something you won 't like flies in . Hey , you really found something ? Vein of Nogelti ... near the second liver , just past the ribs . Set me up for ten lifetimes . Oh , I 'm so happy for you . Be happy for yourself , girl . I want you to have a share . You do ? Well , then I ... I can get food for Zhaan ... for all of us . Just one problem , B 'Soog , that fella , he closed the mines . Bastard 's probably down there right now . Jumpin ' my claim ! Altana , do you think that B 'Soog ... you think B 'Soog killed Temmon ? No more girl , they were brothers . Well , surely we can do something . If not cure it , stablize it . I - I can ... mix a salve , which ... which might slow down the growth of the buds . Great , you stay there and tell me how to mix it . Zhaan , can you tell me ? Bet - ur and Ly - gel ... Right . Which one are they ? The two marked vials . Is it supposed to do that ? Zhaan ... Zhaan ? can you hear me ? Oh , frelling great Officer Sun Yes , what is it , Pilot ? The micro pollen Zhaan 's producing are beginning to affect Moya . She 's experiencing a slight numbing sensation along her inner hull . All right . Put the atmospheric scrubbers to maximum capacity . Already done . Well , I don 't know what else to suggest then . This is your grand gesture of generosity ? Fungus ! Mold ! Lichens ! Yechh ! What 's that you 're eating ? Meat ! Why didn 't I get any meat ? You want meat , You have to pay for it . So , if what I have given you , isn 't to your liking ... No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! You can ignore the little green eating machine . We appreciate what you 've done for us . We need more food . We need enough to last us until we get to the next system . You want more , you have to earn it , like everybody else ... . Once I reopen the mines What do you say we trade ? We 've got medical supplies , weapons ... This is not a commerce planet . If you want meat , Nogelti Crystals buys food , work gets crystals . Then we 'll work ! Dominars do not work ! Especially not in some rotting corpse filled with creatures ! What are those men doing ? Deemo . Do you play ? I 'm about to . We 're here for Zhaan , Maverick , not games . I 'm here for food . This is how I 'll get it ! I 'll introduce you . Most kind . Maybe we should have fried this . Well , it ain 't Lobster , but it 'll keep Zhaan alive . Keep an eye on the chill 'n ' til I get back . Definitely takes the edge off . Man , could it get any worse in here ? I can barely breathe ! Hey Blue ! Delivery . It 's not exactly Dominos , but it got here in less than 30 minutes . John ... Okay . Here ya go ... .. Come on ... Can 't ... ... gone too far ... need meat . No . No , no ... You - you don 't want meat . Meat 's bad for you . It 's got cholesterol , hormones ... Animal proteins stop the budding cycle ... Buds evolved for protection ... famine immobilizes us ... Predator attacks ... Buds poison animal ... When animal dies ... we eat animal ... to recover ! I 'll get you some meat ... Now ! You cheated ! Yeah It 's part of the game You 're just a lousy cheater . I 'll have you know that I 'm an excellent cheater ! I 'm just not at my best right now . This outrageous hunger is affecting me . Let 's see some of these Negeltic crystals you claim to have . We 'll settle up when we 're done ! You know what I think ? Think you don 't have any crystals . Never did . Don 't be ridiculous . You lie about having anything of any value to bet with . I demand another game , or I 'll tear your frelling eyes out ! You little green ass , stinking , horny little bastard , I 'm gonna kill you ! That won 't get you your crystals . You get me my crystals one way or another ! Yeah , you look good on that couch , you always did . I missed you . You chose Temmon over me . Well maybe I made the wrong choice . Temmon 's gone now anyway . You don 't seem too broken up about it . Oh , well , neither do you . Well , we all grieve in our own way . Temmon was a brother , a partner . I will miss him . Yeah , me too . But we gotta move on , The miners need to ... B 'Soog ! Go away . One of our shipmates is dying . She must have meat . You have nothing to trade for it . We 'll get you whatever you want , but I want that meat now ! There must be something you want . Hey ... Is that what this is about ? Free hand outs ? I 've told you , you want meat , you have to pay for it . Maybe you do have something to trade . No ! Does he make all of you decisions for you ? That 's not the Chiana I knew . No , I make my own decisions . Run away Luxan ! Now give me what I need ! You 've got mivolks , Luxan , but I hide the meat in the mine , and no one knows the mines like I do . Kill me , and you 'll never find it , and your shipmate dies anyway . D 'Argo , if he wants a night with me , I 'll give it to him . One night ? I play for keeps . A life for a life . I give you meat , you 're mine till I 'm done with you . What were you thinking , attacking B 'Soog like that ? What , did you think he 'd just hand over the meat ? It seemed like a better plan than waiting for you to frell him into submission ! Well , if that what it takes , then that 's what it takes ! I thought this was supposed to be about saving Zhaan ? There are other ways to get the crystals that we need . I will not allow you to stay here with him ! Don 't tell me what to do ! Well somebody has to ! Chiana ! D 'Argo , I had a brother , he 's gone . I don 't need another . I don 't want to be ... your brother . Then what ? I want to help Do you want to help ? My friend Altana , she 's found this really big vein of crystals . She 's willing to share the wealth . Is it enough to help save Zhaan ? More than enough . Except they closed the mine because of the Keedva . What about if I went down with her ? Calibration is complete . Did Zhaan tell you what intensity to use ? Zhaan 's out of it , Pilot . I 'm doing this on my own . They how do you know it will help ? I don 't , but she 's a plant , and she loves light . What are you reading , Pilot ? Zhaan now seems to be exuding spores as a reaction to the intense light . Can you do anything about it ? I 've minimized Moya 's ambient illumination as a precaution , but the spore levels are still increasing . You 've only made things worse . I had to do something , and you didn 't give me any suggestions Why did you do that ? What ? I was only trying to help . Lies ! You tried to kill me ! Don 't be stupid ! Brutish Peacekeeper ! Can 't wait to see me die ! Are you enjoying this ? Not in the least ! It should be easy ... It 's never easy ! Budong I 'll stay half a cycle , no more I have given you my terms , take them ... or leave them that was the deal , Chiana . Can 't we negotiate ? No Frell ! Where 's D 'Argo ? Did he get some meat ? Yeah , he 's working on it , in the mines . What ? In the ... ! Is he ... nuts ? You remember the creature , don 't you ? How long has he been gone ? I don 't know . Like ... three arns or so . He 's with Altana It should be easy ... . It 's never easy ! I 'm gonna go get him . Zhaan 's spores are spreading faster than the scrubbers can remove it . It 's penetrating Moya 's neural conduits and dulling her senses . How badly ? Already enough to impede navigation ... Can you compensate ? I 'm having difficulty . My own connection to Moya is still much less than optimal . How much damage can these spores do ? If the levels continue to increase , Moya could be permanently blinded . It 's all right . I won 't let that happen Pilot . What if Zhaan were to leave Moya entirely ? If she and I were to leave in a transport pod , then you could open the rest of Moya to space and flush the pollen out . that could ... help Moya ... but what about you ? The spores ... have begun to affect you as well ... . No ! I 'll be fine . We just need to buy some time till Crichton can return with some meat . You prime a transport pod , all right ? Very well . Zhaan 's gone , Pilot D 'Argo ? Slug Monkey Rygel , what the hell are you doing down here ? Get lost Crichton . This one 's mine . You seen D 'Argo ? Forget D 'Argo . That filthy character Vija threw me down here just because I lost at Deemo . He cheated ! What ? And you didn 't ? Of course I cheated ! You cheated and you lost . D 'Argo and Chiana have a line on some crystals , so let 's go . Crichton , I 've got a crystal right here . Our luck is changing . Rygel I 've got your ear , right ? Okay Zhaan is almost out of time , so get your crystal and let 's GO ! Rygel ? Rygel ! Rygel ! Sparky ! Sorry Crichton . Oh , you not You 're not ditching ' me ! Get off , let go ! There 's no reason for both of us to die ! I am a Dominar , you are ... are just ... you ! Shut your yap , and give it more gas ! There is no more ... gas ! Let go ! or we 'll both die ! Screw you ! We 're going down ! Rygel ! Let go , or we 'll both die ! For the last time , No ! Let go , or I 'll bite your fingers off ! Oh , Yeah ! Screw you ! Rygel ! Rygel ... Rygel ... Lucky for you ! Ow ! What was that for ? I ain 't your lunch ! The dentics tasted better . You tasted worse ! here 's the plan . You 're gonna go back to the transport pod and stay there ! What about Vija ? What about Keedva ? Oh ... good plan . Now put our asses down ! Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Why won 't you answer me ? Pilot , why can 't you locate her ? The spores have clouded Moya 's senses so much , I can 't even track where you are . I 'm on Tier Seven , and there 's no sign of Zhaan . Officer Sun , Moya is worsening . If we don 't find Zhaan soon , we may have to flush the atmosphere anyway . Understood . Some water ? Thanks . Couldn 't have done this without you . Both our purposes are served . We save Zhaan , and you get out of here . I 'm not gonna miss the stench , but ... I 'll miss the thrill of it . Thrill ? Always living constantly on your guard , alive and fightin ' ! You sound like Chiana . Ah , that girl . She 's a wild one ! But she 's got a heart of gold . Her loyalties are certainly flexible , that 's for sure . She 'll do whatever it takes , to get meat for your friend . That 's what worries me . Nah , we always came out on time , the two of us . We had our fun . Even when she and Temmon were together . Ah , that fella . He was good for her and her brother . And yet , she repays his kindness by stealing from him . That 's why it 's ... very ... difficult to trust her . D 'Argo , are you and Chiana together ? No No ? Or not yet ? That 's up to her . Aeryn , any further deterioration , and Moya will lose all ability to navigate . Then we can 't wait any longer . But unless Zhaan 's secured herself inside a transport pod , decompression will kill her . Is there no other way to save Moya ? No Then seal off Command and do it . Decompression in ... five microts . Oh , Zhaan Forgive us . Officer Sun , spore levels have dropped . Thank you , Pilot . Beginning repressurization now . It 'll take over an arn . D 'Argo ! AH ! Crichton ! Did D 'Argo make it back ? Well , didn 't you find them ? No , I found Rygel , and one very big ugly critter . They should be back by now with the crystals It 's been one hell of a day . If we don 't get some meat before the end of it , I 'm gonna cut my own damn arm off and feed it to Zhaan . Creature alarm ! Altana ! What happened ? The mines were closed . But some of you decided to ignore that . Where 's D 'Argo and Altana ? I found your friends . But got there too late What the hell do you mean , " too late " ? heard the Keedva , and drove it off . John ! John ! D 'Argo ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Easy . I - I tried to get it , but I couldn 't ... I couldn 't protect her . Altana ? Altana ? D 'Argo , what happened ? The creature attacked . I tried to stop it , but ... How bad you hurt ? Nothing broken . Bloods running clear I 'll survive . Your friend 's lucky to be alive . How could this happen ? First Temmon ... now Altana ? You know what , Boudreau ? For someone that 's supposed to be such a great critter hunter , you ain 't doin ' that good of a job . I closed the mines for a reason . Now , stay out , and let me do what I have to do ! All right , Pip ... What 's the plan now ? He killed Altana . Now he 's going to steal her crystals . I 'm not going to let him . You stay here with D 'Argo . Boudreau is mine . How much longer , Pilot ? Repressurization will be complete in 900 microts . Zhaan ... you don 't understand . You tried to kill me suffocate me poison salve burn me with light . Look , I 've only been trying to help you . No . Always hated me . Came to Delvia . Imprisoned me . Zhaan , they were Peacekeepers I 'm no longer a Peacekeeper . Always a Peacekeeper . Barbaric savage ! Afraid to come near me . Afraid of contamination . That 's not true . Plotting with Pilot against me . Plotting my death . Nobody wants you dead . We did whatever we could to help you , but we ran out of options . Your spores ... are harming Moya . Would never harm Moya Zhaan , Look at me , I can barely talk , I can barely breath properly Your spores are doing that , and it 's far worse for Moya . Moya No , lies to confuse me . No , I 'm trying to get through to you . Zhaan , for the sake of your Goddess , think ! Think ... can 't think hazy . Hello ? Cut through the haze , Zhaan . Think ! You 're a Tenth Level Pa 'u , you trained your mind to control your thoughts . Do it now ! I ... can 't help me All right . I will Pilot ? Yes ? Get the transport pod primed . Nice stash you got here . And you came down to steal some of it . No , fella , you have to earn it . Like Altana was doing before the critter got her Speak of the devil . What do you say we take this conversation some place else ? No Well , I 've heard that somewhere before . Not yet . And I 've see this guy somewhere before . Friend of yours ? It 's a primitive animal , But intelligent in it 's own way . Over the years we have developed a mutually beneficial relationship . Well , I 'm really not interested in your personal life . Now , I should warn you , I don 't taste too good . He won 't eat you He prefers what I give him . That 's how I trained him to have his way Crichton ! Crichton ! I 'll let you two get to know each other . Easy , fella ... Just , ah ... You 're just a big ' ol dog , right ? Yeah . Look what I got . This is for you . Oh yeah ! This is good , huh ? You want this ! Hey , Yah ! There ya go , have a look ! No , no ! That way , that way ! There ya go ! Good boy ! Good boy ! Okay , no more Captain Kirk chit - chat . B 'Soog ! Turn around ! Drop it ! Drop it ! Kick it away ! Where 's Crichton ? I have no idea . Don 't frell with me ! Believe me ! Oh , believe you , Well , that 's a joke ! Get ' em up ! Chiana ... You 're a thief and a tralk ... but you 're not a killer . I 'm ... evolving , as a ... as an individual . I know you . You won 't shoot me in cold blood . You can 't do it . You 're right , I can 't . You bitch ! What did you do ? Don 't leave me here to suffer ! What ? mmh ? That was your fourth plate . More ? D 'Argo , Thank you Another helping ? Ah ... No . Mmm ... It 's wonderful . Yeah . Carolina Style Keedva . Best barbecue this side of a Budong . Thank you , John . For everything . Pleasure . Ya 'll dig in now . Pilot is very relieved that you 're recovering . As ... much as I suffered , your experience was ... was also painful . I only made it more difficult for you You weren 't yourself , Zhaan . No , I was the mindless savage I accused you of being But , uh , It wasn 't very pleasant ... reverting back to such a primitive ... vicious state ... I 'm sorry for what I said . Here , Eat ... Don 't talk . You must be happy to be out of there . You can 't understand , D 'Argo . Understand what ? Loss ? I understand that . It 's not a big thing . Chiana , You don 't have to put on an act for me . D 'Argo , I do what I do to survive . Can 't you just let it go ? I can only let go when I feel safe . You are safe . Am I ?

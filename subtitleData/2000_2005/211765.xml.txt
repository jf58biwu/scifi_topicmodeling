Crais ? Talyn 's supposedly the meanest , deadliest , all time yave-of-the-yuvo. fighter-ship . But somebody , something ... beat the yotz out of him , That 's not Moya . Let 's find the parts to fix the transport pod ... and get the frell outta here . The gray girl ? very nice ... and tasty I doubled you . I ... twinned you . Equal , and original . now on Farscape : Pilot , can 't you keep the environmentals under control ? Transfusing Talyn is a severe drain on Moya . Flying in this turbulent atmosphere is even * more * draining on Moya . I know it 's not as bad as last time , it 's not the cromagnon-copy or the Alien Nation reject , but you can * tell * I 'm the original , right ? Wrong I 'm the original . Try again pal . Have you been messin ' with my stuff ? That 's * my * stuff . And * you * ... are the clone . — Aeryn , you can tell the difference . — Aeryn , you can tell the difference . No ... I can 't . I- - Right . You wear that so I can tell the two of you apart . Wait- - why do I have to wear it ? Because you 're closer . I * want * to help you sort this all out , but we have bigger problems right now . Talyn is dying . But , Pilot thinks the Chromextin will fix Talyn up , right ? If D 'Argo can find it on the planet . You should 've gone down with him . Screw you . I 'm not gonna leave * Crais * alone on Moya . He is comatose , and locked in a medical stabilizer . He does not need guarding from either of you . I don 't trust him . And what if he 's lying ? Fine ! You- - go and keep an eye on Crais . And you- - go to Talyn and help Stark . Why me ? Excellent . Can you also provide us with the quantities we require ? Yes , I believe we can do business . How much Chromextin did you want ? Uh ... six lennerts . For which we 'll * pay * handsomely . Still ... a transaction of that magnitude will need the approval of the Security Director . And he dislikes offworlders . Especially with reputations such as yours . Reputations ? Us ? Watch this . New talent ? Didn 't know Jenet was hiring exotics these- - I don 't work here . Well maybe we 'll give you a try anyway . Don 't move ! I 'll get it for you . Did you hear me ? I tried- - I tried not to start any trouble . Well , you 're not * in * any trouble . Well- - you are . Every * frelling * planet . Ahem ... where are you going ? We still have business . Who do you think that was ? Oh , yotz . Not the Security Director . Good luck ... getting any Chromextin on this planet . Wait- - if you think we 're leaving empty handed- - You 'll be lucky to leave * at all ! * No propulsion , no overrides , no weapons . All bad . Talyn 's so still ... so near death . Even the DRDs are still . I didn 't know he had DRDs . He builds them as he grows . Come on . Primary conduit nexus is completely overloaded . That 's why nothing works . What about the neural link to Crais ? Uh , the link , yes , that 's operating . Crais 's autonomic functions may be the only thing that 's keeping Talyn going . Here , here . That the conduit ? Yeah , yeah . What if you 've got this backwards ? What if we pull Crais 's transponder . He dies and Talyn lives ? Tried that . Nearly killed Talyn . We can 't break the link . We 've got to fix the conduit , and restore Talyn 's caloric flow . So , wake him up . Anything ? Yes , I 'm hungry and there 's nothing sweet on this ship . I was talking about your patient . Well , the lautinal injection I gave him , seems to have had no effect whatsoever . I thought you knew something about medicine ? I * do * . I 'll have * you * know , I earned " T " ratings in Genetics , Neuroscience , and Xenobiology . Good . That 's what I thought . What are you doing ? Zhaan took some tissue and DNA samples from me a while back . I want you to compare ' em ... to me and clone , and figure out ... that I 'm the real thing , and he 's the wannabe . And I why should I do your * selfish * and unnecessary work ? Because I know where Rygel stashes his wamelon cake ... . and it 's sweeter than a sweet thing ... sweet thing . Give it to me . Mmm . Yes . Whoever you are ! Release me ! Aeryn ! Maintenance Bay ! Crais , Let her go . There . I woke him up . Now I hope he drops dead . Crichton . Am I on Moya ? John , what 's ... ? It 's okay . What ? Aeryn Sun ? Yeah . You missed that bit . You 're alive . How ? Let 's ... skip the back story right now . What happened to your ship ? Where is Talyn ? I can barely sense him . He is alive , but unresponsive . Moya is supplying nutrients . Where are we ? In open space ? Low planetary orbit . Talyn and Moya have found an atmosphere with a very high novastatis index . That may conceal us . Who did you piss off this time ? Talyn and I were not the agressors ? Of course not . You never are . So who is it ? The Plakavoids ... the Skeksies ... the Big Bad Wolf ? Peacekeepers . They ... want Talyn back . The Luxan will be disciplined . I apologize for his behavior . According to some witnesses , he has nothing to apologize * for * . You saying * I * was at fault ? Father , these are known criminals . The path of destruction they leave is- - Don 't believe those myths . You know how rumors get started . Then you deny your reputation . I ... deny it 's relevance . We 're here for one reason : To buy Chromextin . Why do you need such a large amount ? Uh ... Medical purposes , hmm ? Chromextin has no medical function . None that you know of , brother . Oh , but it can power weapons . Should we sell them ammunition we can use to attack us , hmm ? Their warships- - our ammunition . We have no warships . Then why hide your vessels in the densest layer of our atmosphere ? To avoid conflict . I ... understand that as this planet 's ruler , you must protect it 's people . Be assured , we pose you no threat . Allow us this simple transaction , and you 'll never see us again . I see no reason not to accomodate them . I see no reason to let them live . Force is your answer to everything . Better than weak mindless pacifis- - We will not do business with you . Tolven ... they have one arn to break orbit . But ... After that ... force is authorized . May I show you out ? We were attempting to resupply when we were ambushed by four Prowlers using strike and retreat tactics . You don 't believe me , Crichton . Only because I know you . Pilot , I 'm accessing Talyn 's logs . Please display this signal for us . Very well , Crais . Talyn destroyed one Prowler . But their attack was merely a diversion . That ship ... is a Pantak Class Vigilante . Yes . Surprising us with an immobilizer pulse . Severely overloading all of Talyn 's systems and dissipating his energy . We barely broke free , initiating Starburst , but that drained the rest of Talyn 's power . I remember nothing further . A Vigilante with an immobilizer pulse . What attacked Talyn was a Retrieval Squad . They will not relent until they accomplish their goal : Recapture Talyn . And to force Talyn 's surrender , they wouldn 't hesitate to take Moya hostage . I will ... return to Talyn so that Moya can flee ... immediately . With Talyn 's condition worsening , Moya will not abandon him , and neither will we . All right , start up the pod . We 're leaving . D 'Argo ? Chiana ? Where are you ? Refreshment house . We 're trying to find another source . Perhaps you don 't realize , but we 've been given one arn to leave . With or without you , I 'm returning to Moya . You aren 't going anywhere . What ? What have you done with the Pod ? Well ... nothing you can fix . Did I lose consciousness again ? Briefly . Is Crichton present ? Shall I summon him ? No . There is something I deeply wish to share with you . Talyn was designed with intelligence gathering facilities . He , and I , have been able to tap into high level Peacekeeper comm channels , accessing their central database . Including your personnel file . Where I found this . Aeryn , wake up . Wake up , Aeryn . Don 't be afraid . My name is Xhalax Sun . I 'm your mother . But you mustn 't reveal to anyone that I was here . Do you ... understand ? I came to tell you something . Aeryn , you 're life was not an accident . And it wasn 't an assigned birthing to fill the ranks . Talyn- - that 's your father 's name . He and I ... chose to have you . You were concieved in love . Our love . I wanted you to know this . It makes you special . We wanted you , and we love you . Go back to sleep now . My mother . Yes . I was never sure whether I dreamt that . And that was on my file ? And hers as well . I thought it might ... interest you to learn of your parents . And my father ... was he ... ? Did you ? I could find no information ... whatever about him . Was my mother court-martialed ? There are gaps in her service record . However , it 's last entry notes a promotion into an elite battle group . Aeryn ... Let me guess . The Retrieval Squad . She is somehow part of it . The Retrieval Squad is under the command of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun . Remove your lower garments , and face * away * from me . What the hell for ? You asked me . If you want a genetic comparison ... I need a specimen . Of what ? ! Well ... skin . Unless you prefer I test your internal organs . You can stay the hell * away * from my organs , lady . Well , skin then- - preferably something with the least amount of solar radiation . Shoulder ... I use SPF 30 . No ! Thank you . Recon stations report the probe has not left the planet . And their other ships ? Still concealed in the bonisphere . Probes detect an unidentified mass in geosychronous orbit . Coordinates precise enough to target ? Airborne Defense says , not yet . They suggest Concussion Missles . Well , have them fire at will . Oh ! It 's not working , it 's not helping . Talyn 's dying , not waking up . Astro ! Work now ... freak ... later ... Oh , yeah ... yes ... that 's fair . Good . How much later ? Pilot ! Missles , launched from from the planet ... exploding in the atmosphere . Aeryn , I 'm going to Command . You stay with Captain Crunch . What about * me * ? ! Pilot , get the planet on the blower . I can 't ! The Nelvastatic cloud cover blocks communications as well as scans . They can 't establish missile-lock until they Take us up , out of range . No , Pilot ! If we ascend out of the bonisphere , we may be revealing outselves to the Retrieval Squad . Ah , hell . I can 't see a thing in this soup . Moya is attempting to extend her senses further , but ... Oh , there 's another one . Brace for the shockwave . Noble Talyn , I stand ready to ease your journey into death . Knock that off , and help me get weapons back on line ! Why don 't you listen ? The weapons console won 't function ! Crais , are you still in contact with Talyn ? Can you get his weapons working ? He hasn 't sufficient energy to fire . Well can he do anything ? Can he point the damn guns ? I believe I can enable targeting . Right do that . Pilot , I want you to take us down . Below the cloud layer ? Do it , Pilot ! I think I know what he 's tryin ' to do . He 's gonna need a comms channel . And I 'm gonna need a comms channel . Crais , I want you to find the fattest target you can- - Government House , missle site , McDonalds- - whatever . Two ships are decending from the bonisphere . It 's a gunship . We 're being targeted . Now , Crais ! Hello , morons . You see this ship ? Knock off the missle attack , or we 'll take our shot . Prepare another salvo . Oh , you might want to check our resume first . We leveled a Shadow Depository , and we 're about to turn your city into glow-in-the-dark sand . Launch missles . No ! Father ! No . Airborne defenses ... stand down . The missles have ceased . It 's about damn time . Who the hell are you ? Rinick Pralanoth , Soverign of Kanvia . John Crichton , Wizard of Oz . You ready to knock off the macho BS and talk these things out ? I 'm willing to reopen the discussion . Good . I 'll notify my reps . I 'd prefer that you and I spoke face to face . Fine . I 'll come down . My offspring . Rinick Tolven , Security Director . Rinick Sarova , Services Director . So tell me , Rinick , Rinick , and Rinick ... what 's your problem ? We come down here to buy something , we don 't hassel you , we don 't try to take it by force . Hell , we offer to make you rich . And you guys break out the pyrotechnics . Violence was an error on our part . Allowing notorious criminals onto our planet was a worse error . Criminals ? No , no , no ... we 're businessmen . Lies . That 's a big word to throw around , son . I can prove it . Get your hands off of me ! Damn it , let me go ! This is not ... not necessary ! What the hell is that ? Get this thing off of me ! Man , you people got a funky sense of humor . get this lobster off my head ! It won 't hurt you ... unless you lie to us . It 's a very ... intuitive creature . It senses brainwave patterns , and is * extremely * sensitive to cognitive dissonance . You lie ... and it knows . And it 's been trained to kill ... when it detects a lie being told . Why have you come to Kanvia ? To buy Chromextin ... period . For what purpose ? None of your damn business . * Nothing * ... that affects you . Are you planning to seize power , hmm ? Or perhaps one of the subcounselors is getting ambitious again . Have you been hired to sabotage our unification ? We could give a damn about your local politics . We 're here to buy the stuff and then get the hell outta Dodge ! Why is that so difficult to get through your tiny little brain ? Remove the Stranit . Calorics have dropped to critical levels . The immobilizer pulse overloaded too many of Talyn 's systems . Repairs alone cannot save him . What can we do ? Nothing until the Chromextin arrives , but after that ... Aeryn you must join us . Your mother 's involved now . She 'll take him alive if possible , but I know Talyn . He 'll fight to the death , his or your mothers . And you expect me to fight on Talyn 's side ? I hope your presense will provide another solution . She loved you . And * if * that part of her still lives ... only you can find it . She 's an officer . Part of the Elite . She is nothing . A thug , a mindless assassin . As you and I once were . But * you * ... can give her a chance ... to be something more than that . Daybreak . Talyn may be dead by then . It 's the best I could do . The old man says it 's going to take him that long to scrape up six ... whatevers . Lenarts . Lenarts , right . Says there 's not enough at any one single parish , so he 's got to send his Deputies out to collect it , and who the hell knows if that 's true . Well ... it may be true . I spent the whole day trying to buy some . There wasn 't one source out there that had the whole amount that we need . I say we just go get the guns and steal the stuff . We would have to complete * ten * robberies to do that . Yeah , so what 's your point ? Is this a proposition ? John Crichton . This is Rinick Sarova . Phone ... Oh , hey , hey , hey . Umm ... how ya doin ? We must speak privately about the Chromextin you require . I fear you 'll never get it . Are you willing to meet me alone ? How about we talk about it right now ? No . There 's a service corridor behind the Refreshment House you 're in . I don 't like it either . Shall we go inside ? It 's closed . The door is locked . I own this refreshment house . In that case , you can buy me a drink . How can there be a problem ? Your father promised us the stuff . My brother objects . He won 't defy my father openly , but he will try to block this transaction somehow . And daddy can 't keep him leashed ? You think my father 's weak . You tell me . Pralanoth unified this planet . He ended the wars between nation states and brought peace to this world . Excepting the occassional missle attack on visiting ships . That was Tolven 's doing . Yeah . Your brother got a death wish ? No . But he wants to rule . Mmm . Meaning he wants daddy 's job . Yes . However , Pralanoth has declared that after his death , Tolven and I should share power . Well , your brother doesn 't strike me as the , uh ... sensitive power-sharing type . We took an oath that we would co-rule . But I 'm sure that Tolven will disregard it and sieze control . Can 't you stop him ? The conflict would fragment this world once again . I would * prefer * my father saw reason . And put you on top . Tolven suspects this . He also knows he lost face when my father overruled his missle attack . He , uh ... could have lost a lot more . You know , you really don 't want to see what our gunship ... can do . But Tolven would risk it . He is sure to interfere with the Chromextin delivery , hoping to provoke you into ... attacking us . And he counterattacks . Proving to Pop that he was right all along . Yes ... I therefore ask ... for patience . I 've been nothing but ... patient . And , uh ... I think you need to understand that I 'm under a lot of pressure . I do understand , and I will do all that I can to hasten the process . Even if it means bypassing normal channels to locate ... my own sources ... Sarova ? Never thought my brother ... capable of this . Crichton ! He is over there . Don 't ... pull it out ! Get ... Crichton away from here . No one must find us together . This meeting never happened . Go , now ! Rygel ... we 're on our way . Well , hurry up ! Come to finish the task , my brother ? Sylveko , he 's bleeding ! You have a keen grasp of the obvious , help him . Help him ! How is he ? We don 't know yet . You 're doing fine . Yeah , right . I could be killing him for all you know . A major artery 's been cut . He 's lost a lot of blood . Well , then * replace * it . You 're similar species ! Are you klempt ? ! Even within my species the subtypes have to match . My blood ... is donor incompatable . Take mine . Really ? Yeah , I know , he 's an ugly loudmouthed son-of-a-bitch , ... but I can 't stand around and watch him die . Be better for both of us if you did . Yeah , I know . Now shut up . Well , neither his genetic sample nor yours ... shows any sign of degradation . You 're both perfect- - if that 's the right word- - * copies * of the original Crichton . Screw your tests . I 'm the original . Of course you are ... the other guy said the same thing . Why does this bother you ? Don 't humans have monozygotic double births ? This is different . Twins don 't start out fully formed sharing the same life . This sucks . It sucks big time . How you doin ' ? Crappy ... on the up side ... it 's easier to tell us apart now . D 'Argo filled me in on your adventures with the Gotti Family * , but I need some details from you . Why ? 'Cause the show must go on . Why won 't you tell me the truth ? I did tell you . You went to the Refreshment House for an after-hours drink ... alone ? Yes . A witness saw a wounded Crichton being taken out after the explosion . They 're mistaken . Then you deny he was with you ? Give me Stranit to prove . Tolven , don 't be ridiculous . Sarova would not lie to me . Morning , all ! Ho , ho ! And what a * beautiful * morning it is . How ya 'll doing ? We have two , count ' em two , Transport Pods , on your loading dock , ready and waiting- - What the hell happened to you ? A bomb exploded at the Refreshment House . No . Well hell , who would do such a thing ? You tell us . You were there having a secret meeting with Sarova . No I wasn 't . You were seen . I have a witness . Who also * swore * that Crichton was badly wounded Well , maybe his species heals rapidly . Maybe your witness was blitzed . Now why- - other than a social call- - would I be having a secret meeting with Sarova . Well , I have to assume you were conspiring to take power . Perhaps you two were constructing a bomb when it accidently went off . I want an apology . I want the truth . You can 't handle the- - Let 's cut the crap . Let 's cut to the chase , stick this critter on my face . Whoa , ho , ho , ho ! Look at the suckers on that boy ! Damn , in some parts of the universe this thing would be considered good eatin ' ! My name is John Crichton , Astronaut . I was * not * at the Refreshment House after-hours , I was not * present * at any bombing or explosion , I did not have a * private * meeting with the beautiful Miss Sarova . The end . Cross my heart , smack me dead , stick a lobster on my head . Our money ... is in the Transport Pods . Can we have our stuff now ? ... please . Give it to them . Two lenarts are packaged and ready . The rest is still on it 's way here . Then load it up . Whoa ... okay . Oh , how are you doing ? Jool did good . I 'm all right . Well , Rygel and Chiana have just delivered a partial load of Chromextin to Talyn , and that may boost his kelvoy levels enough to bring him out of his paralysis . Uh-huh . So , what 's next ? Well , now ... Crais will divert all of Talyn 's energies into restoring Starburst . Meaning he plans to ditch . He is protecting Talyn . Yeah , you keep sayin ' that . Well , you know ... he-he has saved our lives . He did kill Scorpius . I-I don 't know what it 's going to take for you to trust him . So , you trust him ? Well ... whether or not I trust him , this time I do believe him . So , what do we do ? Spread it all over the exposed conduits . Rygel ... you take the inner hull . Ha , do I look like a DRD Yeah , you do , actually ... So make yourself useful ... Oh , no , no , I don 't want and make like one . Another dark and smelly place ! I hate being useful ! Yeah ... we know . Where else ? What ... have you done ? ! Crais ... what 's the matter ? Crais , Crais ! Crais , Crais , what is it ? ! Murderers ! Hold him down ! Help me ! What 's happening ? Crais , what is it ? What 's happening ? ! Poison ! What wrong ? Wha ... I don 't know . The chromextin should have acted as a stimulant , instead it sent Talyn into convulsions . Well , it 's definately chromextin ... but apparently it 's laced with chlorium . What 's chlorium ? An anaesthetic that numbs Leviathans . Oh , mixing that with a simulant * probably * wasn 't a very good idea . Anyway , glad I could help , but it 's been an * extremely * long day . Sorry , Jool , we need you to work some overtime . We need you to strain the chlorium out of that stuff . With this equipment , it 's going to take forever , and even if I was sure of how to do it- - which I 'm not ... Pilot . Yes , Commander ? Can Moya filter out the poison , like she did when Aeryn was sick ? Moya is willing to try . Are you sure it won 't harm Moya- - the chlorium ? her mass is much greater than Talyn 's . She believes its effects upon her will be minimal . All right , tell Chiana and Jool what to do , I 'm heading back to Talyn . Same here . You open , I 'll pour . Fine . You 're spilling it . You want to pour ? The Retrieval Squad are here . They have to be . I think you 're right . You realize , John , that if we can revive Talyn , we have to Starburst away immediately , and we can 't go back . Yeah , I kind of figured that when I saw you packing your bag . We heading down ? Yes . I 'm just going to duck under the bonisphere for a microt so we can contact them with the news . Oh , that 's gonna make him * really * happy . You been screwin ' me from the beginning ! Ah , ah , ah . I don 't think so . Screwin ' everybody , screwing ' your sister ... You been lyin ' to your daddy , boy , and you know you shouldn 't lie to your daddy ! It 's gonna stop ! Who 's your daddy ? ! Come on , you know who your daddy is . Who 's your daddy ? D 'Argo tell 'm who his daddy is ! I 'm your daddy . That 's right ! You 're gonna start tellin ' the truth ! The prosecution calls , Mr. Rinick , Jr. to the stand ! Did you poison the chromextin ? What are you talking about ? It was poisoned with chlorium . Did you contaminate it ? ! No . You had * nothing * whatsoever to do- - with poisoning it ? Nothing whatever . Then who did ? I don 't know . Does this crab-thing always work ? In a few rare cases ... a disciplined mind has managed to fool it . You tell me that * now * ? ! But my offspring are not liars . Huh-uh . At the Refreshment House ... did you plant the bomb or have it planted ? No , and no . But you fired the missles at our ship . Oh , absolutely . And you didn 't want us to get * any * chromextin . Of course , I never thought you should get any . But when I 've been overruled , I 've complied with my fathers orders . Yeah . Ain 't you just the good and loyal son . I 'm sorry ... I didn 't hear that . Are you not ... a good and loyal son ? Tell him . I don 't have to answer to him . But you do have to answer to * me * ! I don 't need to prove myself . Get this thing off me ! Do you hear me ? ! Do * you * , hear * me * ? Answer ! Father ... Have you been disloyal ? Yes or no ? You swore an oath to this family . Have you ... dishonored it ? Do you intend to ? No ! Get out of here . Stark , power is returning . Keep splicing those conduits . Splicing , splicing , fixing , fixing , splicing , splicing , fixing , fixing ... Talyn is ... Talyn ... can you hear me ? Welcome back . Can he Starburst ? Not yet . But the treatment is working . Calorics are rising . Where are they ? Must be back aboard their ships . All their transport pods are gone . Fire concussion missles . No . Father ... we must avenge Tolven . There is nothing to avenge . Tolven 's betrayal is what caused his death . Airborne defense ... this is Sarova ... About time ! Anything goin ' on ? Oh-kay , here we go again ! Talyn can 't take this punishment . Pilot , we must ascend ! But is Talyn recovered enough to Starburst ? Irrelevant now ! We cannot stay here , and we dare not descend ! Release the umbilicals . Moya refuses ... She won 't leave Talyn behind , naturally ... If Moya will not disengage , I will ! Talyn , listen to me , you * must * ascend . He 's right , Talyn . Let Moya get to safety . Do not resist me ! We 're out of the bonisphere . And Moya 's sensing a Peacekeeper scan . Talyn , Starburst immediately ! Now , Talyn . Yes you can ... you must . Talyn 's done it , he 's escaped ! Prepare for immediate Starburst . Have both ships Starburst away ? They must have discovered the chlorium contamination , and filtered it out . How much chromextin did they get ? Two lenarts . A third of what they asked for . Then the gunship will remain ... debilitated for some time . We need only find it . I failed . Aren 't you going to kill me ? Come on . He took Winona . Oh well , at least he left you this , lovely jacket . I was wearin ' that . Oh , come on- - crack a smile will you ? At least he 's out of your nose . Hair . That 's what I meant , at least he 's out of your nose hair . My notebook ! He-he took my notebook , and my pen . The son-of-a-bitch set it up , he set it up so that he 's on Talyn with Aeryn . Now ... wouldn 't you have done exactly the same thing ? No ... I would not ! Yes ... Maybe ... ! I don 't know ! I just ... hope he 's havin ' a good time . No , forget that ! I hope he 's havin ' a * terrible * time . I don 't know ... what I hope , he just better be taking care of her . Oh , I 'm sure he 's taking care of her . You know ... what I mean . What do you mean you 're not taking us back to Moya ? Rygel , we can 't go back yet . There will be no contact with Moya until the threat of the Retrieval Squad is resolved . He 's right Rygel , so we 'll just have to accept it gracefully . Frell ' gracefully ' . Well , if I must be imprisoned here , feed me and show me to my quarters . Talyn 's passenger facility isn 't fully developed yet . Food will be tightly rationed . And you two ... will have to share accomodation . Unacceptable ! There 'll be my side , and your side ! My side , your side ! Don 't start . Look . Do you ... do you really know what you 're in for ? Oh , I never do . Is there something that , ah ... you 're not telling me ? The Retrieval Squad is commanded by my mother . Your mother . Right , she 's out here ... chasing Talyn . Yeah , how do you know that ? Crais told me . Crais . Look , there are zillions of Peacekeepers . Why would your mother be assigned ? You really think it 's a coincidence ? No . I have to assume that they are aware of my relationship with Talyn , and that they are hoping that my mother 's presense will divide my loyalties . But I will * not * let them get Talyn back . Even if it means I have to kill her . Sous-titres © Chrismich Pour Djobi

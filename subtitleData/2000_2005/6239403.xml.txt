 Wow , I 'm finally going to see my favorite chef ... TV 's Elzar ! Ah , this is the greatest nanosecond of my life . No , this one is . No , this one . Wait ... that one was slightly worse . Ah , so far so good on this one . And now , here he is ... chef , restaurateur , author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner ... and Cooking Dinner For Slugs ... Elzar ! Yay ! All right ! Yeah ! Yeah , baby ! Whoo ! Elzar ! Elzar , you 're my god . Please sign this sketch I drew of you . Oh , Elzar , bless you . Mmm ... Mmm ... Uh ... Uh ... Now , this is why I prefer your nonstick robots . Oh . All right ! Yeah ! Whoo ! All right , yeah ... whoo , whoo . Hey , I hope you folks like Cajun food ... - Hoo-wee ! - ' Cause today we 're making ... Elzar 's down-home Neptune-style gumbo . You want to boil some oysters ... in a pot of down-home , Neptune-style gumbo . Boiled ? Interesting ! Bender , please try to be a little quieter . No , you shut up . Of course , every now and then , you want to knock it up a notch ... with a blast from your spice weasel . Bam ! Oh , yeah ! Bam it again , Elzar ! Knock it up another notch . Geez , who let this guy through the metal detector ? Come on , you wimp , work that weasel ! Quit holding out on us ! If you promise ... to stop interrupting , all right . Against my will , I 'm going to knock it up another notch . Ooh , I got to get this notch up knocking on film . Hey , Elzar , think fast ! Wha ... Huh ? Oh ! My eye ! I 'm blind ! Bam ! Tell me , Doctor , how 's my cyst ? Grande . I don 't like the looks of this doctor . I bet I 've lost more patients than he 's even treated . Okay , what does this look like to you ? Um ... a grayish blob ? Right . And this one ? Um ... a grayish blob ? Not as right that time . It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation . Nice try , little boy . You may have your textbook knowledge ... and your real diploma ... but I have more skill in my little claw ... than you have in your whole carapace . You seem a bit tense . Here , try these . Sure , butter me up with candy . Well , it won 't work , sonny . Why always the fighting ? Your eye just needs some rest . You 'll have to wear this patch for about a week . Oh , a week ? What do you think , Dr. Zoidberg ? Clack . Thanks for the help , Leela . Leela , we 're right here ! I 'm not deaf . I just have to wear this stupid eye patch . Does it look stupid ? No . In fact , it-it looks so nice ... l-I think I might get one , too . It 's Elzar again ! Oh , my God , I 'm so excited , I wish I could wet my pants ! Leela , please , let me make this up to you . You and your friends are all invited ... to my restaurant tonight . I 'm going to bam you up a dinner you 'll never forget . All right ! Oh , yeah ! Great ! Hooray for Blindy ! Oh , God ... I 'm coming down ! Folks , tell the neighbors to watch your mouth ... 'cause your taste buds are going on vacation . I made you each your own special meal ... so dig in ! It 's the biggest Jamaican platter I 've ever seen ! Jerk chicken , jerk beef , jerk pork . Is there any meat this man can 't jerk ? The king crab is to die for . Look ... a tiny edible crown . What 's it made of ? Wood . Mmm . Fry , you got to try the Sterno Nicoise . No , thanks . That 's robot food . It 's so good . Oh , just try a little . No , really , I don 't ... Mmm . You doing all right over there , Leela ? Oh , yeah . This salad 's fantastic . So fresh . Oh , my . That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me . Everybody enjoy their dinner ? God , yes , Elzar ! Well , I sure enjoyed cooking for you ... and to make everything completely square ... I want you to have ... these complimentary after-dinner chocolates . What 's this under the chocolates ? Yeah , you take care of that whenever you want . - Hey ! - What ? A bill ? You 're charging us after you blinded me ? Hey , I made you a nice meal . This ain 't a charity . $ 1,200 ? Holy zombie Jesus ! We don 't have that kind of money ... especially not Zoidberg . They took away my credit cards . Okay , okay , wait . I know how to take care of this , no problem . You deadbeats are under arrest . It 's a stone-cold shame . He 's making a break for it ! Get him ! No , no , l-I was just picking my nose . He 's picking his nose ! Get him ! The old dine-and-dash , eh ? My daddy owned a restaurant , and it 's punks like you ... that kept him from going regional . That 's why I became a cop . Now it 's payback time . Aw , yeah . Please don 't hit me ... I 'm brittle ! Hey , wait a second . I 've got the perfect solution . Listen to the smart robot . I love cooking , and Elzar 's ass loves getting kissed , right ? No question . So , how about I work part-time ... at the restaurant to pay off our debt ? I don 't know . I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable . Oh , Bender 's a model employee . He 's so polite . And hard-working . He 's made of candy . Okay , fine , I 'll give it a shot . Hot diggity ! You better keep your nose clean . That 'll be easy . I never wear the damn thing . Ah , time for my precious 10 : 00 a.m. Meeting . Where in Legoland is Leela ? I 'm here , and I 'm getting along just fine , thank you . My walk to work just took a little longer today than usual . Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason . Leela , a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about . Like , maybe I could do your makeup . I don 't need help . For your information , I did this all by myself . You look beautiful ! Incidentally , my favorite artist is Picasso . Well , I 'm off to work at the restaurant . One of you will have to fill in for me while I 'm gone . Better yet , I 'll build someone to fill in for you . Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster ... with freeway on-ramps for arms ... and a heart as black as coal . Well , if that new guy can 't handle things , give me a call . I 'm done siphoning out the grease trap . I think I need a mint . So , uh , what job do I move up to ? Pastry chef ? Saucier ? Soup guy ? Bam ! Yeah ... bam yourself . Hey , who are they ? Let 's just say they 're very good customers ... and I 'm not answering any more questions . - Are they the Robot Mafia ? - Yes . You call this a table ? You call this a table ? I wouldn 't hit a guy over the head with this table . You hear that ? The Don-bot don 't like it . I ought to clamp you ! You want to be clamped ? ! Whoa , whoa , calm down , Clamps . The boss , he likes a wall ... against which his back can be put against ... such as like this there . But that table 's already ... Ah , let me bus that for you gentlemen . No . What I meant to do was ... I can 't believe this . Mind your own business and get out ! Hmm , I like this guy 's lack of style . So 's I finally give this guy ... a pair of cement shoes , which he likes ... 'cause they 're lighter than his lead ones . Hey , you think this computes over here ? Where 's all my change ? I gave you a 100 . No , you gave me a 50 . - Oh , no , I didn 't . - Yeah , you did . Hey , you trying to steal from the Don-bot ? I 'm trying , but he 's not making it easy . Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy , huh ? I like you , kid . Here 's something for your trouble . It 's money . Wow , thanks . Hey , you earned that 50 bucks . You gave me a 20 . I did ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I meant ... Hey , wait a minute . I got a good feeling about you . Say , you want to work for me as a hired goon ? Are you kidding ? I 've always wanted to break into gooning . Hey , Elzar , I quit ! 'Kay ! We 're going to try you out with a little delivery job . It 's for a , uh , private lottery that we run . Wow ! You guys run numbers ? Well , nothing fancy ... you know , ones and zeros mostly . Just take this disk over to the pool hall ... and give it to Sammy " The Mechanical Bull " Gravano ... and watch out for the cops . That 's just what my mom used to tell me . Whoo ! That 's some fine oil-ade , son . We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia ... which I 'm sort of in . You flatter me , kind goon ... but I 'm only programmed to sell oil-ade ... and write in cute backwards letters ... like on the sign here . Aw , crap . The cops . Seen any suspicious activity ? Nope , but check out today 's " Marmaduke . " Solid . Hey , it 's that skel from Elzar 's . Undercover pursuit in progress ... baby . Gotcha ! What seems to be the problem , officers ? Was I speeding ? We 'll decide what you were doing ... after an illegal search . He 's clean . Smells nice , too . - Better than me ? - Aw , yeah . Courtesy of Mr. Bender . Nice job , Bender . You passed the test . You want to join me , Clamps and Joey Mousepad ... at our , uh , social club tomorrow night ? Uh , I 'd rather plan some felonies . Oh . Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters . Don-bot , I beg you . I can 't make this week 's loan payment . Look into your hard drive and open your " mercy " file . File not found . Let that be a warning to you . Thank you , Don-bot . Joey ... Clamps , Donnie B. Hey , listen , Bender , we got a big score planned ... but , uh , we need some muscle . A little of this , huh ? Ho-ho-ho ! This guy 's an ox . He 's got oxen-like strength . Hey , he needs a nickname , right ? Let 's call him " Clamps . " Clamps ? That 's my name , you numskull ! Don 't make me clamp you one ! How about Blotto ? It 's gritty . It 's got street cred . Plus , I can keep my monogrammed slippers . Good thinking . Hey ! Now , this score ain 't gonna be ... no cakewalk in the tea park , all right ? There may be some death-killing . It 's going to be clamp this , clamp that ... ba-da-climp , ba-da-clamp . What do you think , Blotto ? You in ? It 's funny . Until now , I always wanted to be a gangster . So the answer 's yes . Hey , hey , way to go , way to be , way to shoot . Now , since we 'll be committing crimes ... which may be against the law , I suggest you have an alibi . An alibi , huh ? I don 't feel good . I 'm genuinely sick . But we 're about to take off . We got to eat our blast-off sundaes . I can 't move . Oh , I think I 'm going to output . Okay , you stay in bed . I 'll eat yours . Bender 's sick . Hmm , need any help taking off ? I 'm fine , thank you . A real pilot can navigate by feel alone . That 's coming out of your pay . You know the secret of traditional robot cooking ? Start with a good high-quality oil . Then eat it . So , uh , what 's this big score anyway ? We 're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars . Zubans ? ! Those are the finest cigars in the universe . I can stink up a whole maternity ward ... with one of those things . Yo , there 's our pigeon now . Let 's shoot bullets out of our guns . All right , here 's the battle plan . We shoot , they surrender , we go aboard ... somebody does some clamping ... then we heist the cigars and go home . And all without killing anyone . This gang 's got some fresh , new ideas . I admire that . Oh , we 'll kill them , all right . We got them heavily out-clamped . They won 't know what clamped them ! Wow , it 's too bad you can 't see , Leela ... 'cause there 's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody . - Whoa ! - Whoa ! I 'm taking evasive action . Uh , Leela ? Stop bothering me , Fry . I need full concentration . Eyesight is for chumps . Their desire to keep living shows me no respect . Hey , Blotto , roll down the window and start shooting . Um ... Oh , uh ... Ooh , he got me ! Oh ! What a shot that guy is . Wait , why do the raised letters ... that normally say " Turn Master Steering Wheel Company " ... say " Nibbler " ? Oh , no ! I 'm back at the wheel , Fry . Everything 's under control . Great , great . The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance . Aah ! They 're coming straight toward our proximity ! Maybe you should give them the clamps , Clamps . Gee , you think ? You think that maybe I should use these clamps ... that I use every day at every opportunity ? You 're a freakin ' genius , you idiot ! The engine 's stalled . I 'm trying the manual fuel pump . Hello , we 're the Robot Mafia ... the entire Robot Mafia . We 're here to steal your cigars . You 'll never get away with this . Unless you let us live . Then you 'll get off scot-free . Joey , Clamps ... hurry up and blindfold them before they see us some more . Hey , boss ... looks like somebody beat us to it . I 'll assume that 's a joke at my expense . Well , who 's laughing now ? ! - Hee-ya ! - Ooh ! Hey , where 's Blotto ? He should be here learning the trade . Sorry I 'm tardy , old bean . I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich . Hey , he 's more classy than I realized . Tie up the prisoners . Capital idea , old sport . I say , get the hell off me . That guy sounds familiar . Oof ! My word , what have we ... Nothing to see here , old girl . Hey , boss , this here crew list ... lists a robot on this crew here . All right , I want you to find him and plug him ... then unplug him . No ! I got a little surprise ... in store for that guy ... the clamps ! Huh ? Uh , wait ... old spice . Uh , let me have a go at this mechanized chap . I can be quite the rough customer . Oh , no . Poor Bender . I don 't feel good . Chew on this ! What-ho ! Take that , you twit ! No , stop it ! That 's the last of them . All right , now , let 's Mafia things up a bit . Joey , burn down the ship . Clamps , burn down the crew . Uh , Donnie , baby ... give me a chance here , huh ? Youse guys skedaddle . Let me take care of the doity woik . Hey , I like your attitude ... and your latest accent . Keep it up and I might just get you ... your own pair of clamps , huh ? The clamps ... Clamps , clamps , clamps . Phew . Leela , we may not have much time left ... so let 's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender . He was like a big computer that ran on magic . Help ! Help ! Bender . You 're okay . Yes , I am ... having just this minute regained consciousness . I 've got an idea . Hold still . It 's about to break . Yes ! Yes ! All right ! - Yay ! - Yeah , it broke , all right . I 'm telling you ... Leela was cool , she was in command ... and when she kicked people , it hurt . It really hurt . Well , this is the big moment . It 's finally time to take my eye patch off . I 'll handle the snipping . After all , I do have the proper equipment . I think it 's Blotto ... that gangster I saw when my patch fell off . Professor ? Where were you at 10 : 00 p.m. Last night ? Where am I now ? So they sent a helpless child to kill me . Well , I 'm not going out without a fight . Hee-ya ! Fine kick , sir , but I 'm actually here ... to deliver your cut from the cigar heist . Oh , sweet legal tender . Kid , tell the Don-bot I 'm quitting organized crime . From now on , I 'll stick to the regular kind . Uh , it 's funny , Bender . With you sick and Leela blind ... only I know what really went on up there . Maybe someday I 'll tell you the whole story . And maybe someday , I won 't listen .

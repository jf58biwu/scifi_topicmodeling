Thank you , Jeff . Good point . Trust no one , except for us . Zoltan . Wait a second . Let 's recap . Last night , we lost my car we accepted stolen money from a transsexual stripper and now some space nerds want us to find something we can 't pronounce .

I gotta take a crap . - Told you . - I know . I know your body . Boys , I got some good news . We just got your car in this morning . All right ! But the bad news is not only did Officer Boyer send your car to the impound he tagged it for auction and it was sold this afternoon . Rick . - Do you know who bought the car ? - I have the address right here . All right . But it 'd be against Regulation 457XY2-665 to give it to you . Come on . Just ...

One , two , three . JESSE : I 'm okay . You okay ? Shibby . ( BIRD SQUAWKS ) ( BIRD SQUAWKS ) Dude , it 's a llama . It 's not a llama . It 's an ostrich . Okay , okay , okay very slowly , let 's turn around and go back the other way . - Okay . New plan . We turn around again , very slowly and go back the other way . - Okay . They 're everywhere . What now ? Hey , I saw this thing about ostriches on Animal Planet . - They 're llamas , dude . - No . What you 're supposed to do is stand very still and eventually , they 'll get bored and go away . I think it 's working . Stupid llamas ! Chester ! Just get in this car ! Go , go ! What do ostriches eat ? - Why ? - Well if they eat peanuts we can just throw a peanut and they 'll go away . - We don 't have any peanuts . - Weak ! We 're screwed ! They 're leaving . It worked . What worked ? Whatever we did ! CHICK 1 : Now may I have the continuum transfunctioner ? Not quite yet . Please ? Scary dream , huh ? What 's up ? My name is Mark . - Where are we ? - You 're in the punishment room . This is where he likes to keep the ostrich poachers . - Poachers ? - Yeah , that 's right . I 've been in this cage for three years , five months , and 17 days but who 's counting ? How 's my breath ? That bad , huh ? Where you guys from ? I 'm from Connecticut . Hi . Mark . There we go . Chester ! Get him off ! Pierre ! No , that 's not what it looks like . Maybe a little bit . - How was your nap ? WITH FRENCH ACCENT : Shut up ! Okay . Well , somebody sure is a Grumpy Gus today . In France , when a man is caught poaching ostriches we shave his head , and we make him run through the fields . Oh , God , that 's the good part . Once you have seen this you are never quite the same . - Okay . - Tell me about it . I used to model . Lucky for you , I am an honorable man . A what ? I 'm sorry ? I said , " I am an honorable man .

If you get it wrong , well , you will be spending a lot of time with the ever-popular Mark . I can be very nice . All right . Here it is . What is the average running speed of a full-grown male African ostrich ? Pass . - Pass to me . I know it . - Pass to Mark . You cannot pass ! Shut up ! Do I have to hose you down again ? Don 't hose me ! Maybe later . - Dude , we 're dead . - Hey , not so fast . The full-grown male African ostrich or the Latin Struthio camelus can grow to an average size of 6 feet , 6 inches and weigh from 225 to 350 pounds and can get up to an average speed of 27 miles per hour . This is absolutely correct ! Animal Planet . Well , I said , " Brown . " Here , let me get you out of this stinking cage . Oh , please forgive me . Can I get you guys some beers ?

Captain Stu tickets . Awesome ! Oh , jellybeans . No jellybeans . Cool straw . - I 'm gonna keep this . - Yeah . I don 't see a continuum transfunctioner . Wait a second . What do we know about the continuum transfunctioner ? It 's a very mysterious and powerful device . And ? And its mystery is only exceeded by its power . But has anyone ever said what it looks like ? No . They haven 't . That was Jesse and Chester . They 've got the continuum transfunctioner ! Quick ! To my mother 's minivan ! That was Jesse and Chester .

Oh , no , it 's you two ! Look , I almost got it . You 're really starting to irk me with your Rubik 's Cube fixation ! Sweet ! No wonder they 're so impossible . You 've activated the continuum transfunctioner . What 's going on ? Once all five of the dirugian crystals stop flashing the universe will be destroyed . How do you know ? We intercepted interstellar transmissions . - Zoltan . - Nerds . JESSE : Way to go , Chester . Sorry . You must give it to us to deactivate it . We are the keepers of the transfunctioner . They will use it to destroy the universe .

You know what , dude ? I refuse to let us go down in history as the dudes who destroyed the universe . How do we find out which ones are the true keepers ? It 's simple . We ask them a question about last night that only the ones that are telling the truth would know . But we can 't remember a thing . Uh-oh . - You gotta hurry . - Not now , Jeff . Zip it . If we really did give one of you guys a ride last night then you 'll know the answer to this . Hurry ! What score did we get on the 18th hole of the miniature golf course last night ? You got a hole in one . That is correct ! Deactivation complete . Wait . If you guys don 't remember a thing about last night ... - How do you know they told the truth ? - It 's simple .

Boy , those guys are in a hurry . - I want to go on that ride , Daddy . - Me too , son .

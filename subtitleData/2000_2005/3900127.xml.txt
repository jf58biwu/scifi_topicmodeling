 You and you bloody short cut got us lost , Roxton The rendezvous point is right over the hill Marguerite . We 'll be there long before Challenger and Veronica . No we won 't . We are going the wrong way . Fine . You go your way and I 'll go mine ! This entire endeavour is a complete waste of time . Malone vanished when the airship exploded . You have to stop to think why him and not us . - Why if we just survive ? - I don 't know . But we 've been searching for days and we haven 't found a single trace of him . He 's gone ! - And we are lost . - We are not lost ! But we will be if you keep leading the way ! It 's the most annoying headstrong woman I 've ever met . She is complete exhausted my patience . Marguerite ! Come on , let 's go ! Coming , coming hardly worth the effort . Oh great , now which way ? Roxton ! Rather better be you . Allow me fair maiden . Thank you , kind sir whoever you are ? I 'm your guide to a better life . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Thanks for the lift . Now , if is not too much trouble , would you kindly tell me who you really are ? Francois Locke , at your service . this are my companions as Condillac and Blum . We 're travelers on the road of life ... a life of high adventure ... and extravagant pleasure . Travelers ? A few souvenirs we 've picked up along the way . - Another way for stolen . - Borrowed , actually . It 's nice to surrounded oneself of the ... trappings of a refine and civilized society . Don 't you agree ? Hundred percent . I 'm sure this is one of many things we have in common . Oh I 'm sure it 's the only thing we have in common . Oh I doubt that very much , in fact ... I 'm sure you 'd be much happier with me and my ... companions than with those poor lost souls you called your friends . What do you know about my friends ? I 've been watching you for days . I know everything about you . Marguerite . And I can give you everything you want ... So it would appear . Roxton , what 's happened to you ? - Where is Marguerite ? - But , she was with you . Until we had an argument . She went one way and I went ... hit in the head and robbed You were robbed ? by whom ? Oh Tom , Dick and Harry , George . I don 't know , I didn 't see them . Oh maybe Marguerite was accosted by the same people who attacked you . Unless she went back to the tree house I 'll go back and check . That 's a good idea , send us a message with the signal mirrors if you see her . Got it ! We better go back to the last place you saw her and start from there . - If anything has happened to her ... - Don 't you worry . I suppose I should be flattered by your offer monsieur Locke . But the life of an outlaw it 's never as glamorous as you make it sound . Oh , but it is . Especially once you 'd heard everything I have to offer you 'll leap at the opportunity . You are very sure of yourself . So are you . I 'm sure my affections can 't be bought that easily . I 'm disappointed , Marguerite . - Life is full of disappointments . - Doesn 't have to be . My friends have probably picked up your trail by now . And when they get here you 're going to have a lot more trouble than you bargained for . Your friends will never find our mobile Shangri-la . It really doesn 't matter . If this is not the life for you , I would gladly take you ... back to your dull companions . But first consider this ... my travels have taken me all around the world . And I can leave this plateau as easily as you breathe the air between us . No kidding ! Let me guess . The way off is in a cave , across the lake , or at the bottom of the glacier cavern . I was in Paris a little over a month ago . Oh , dressed like that ? You must made quite a sight . Or are the fashions of the seventeenth century back in vogue . How 's your French ? April 6 , 1922 . How very strange ! That 's Marguerite handiwork , all right ? I say about eight or nine attacked through this way . And run off in that direction . It 's like Marguerite 's footprints end right here . Then the must have carried her off But why would they take her and just rob you ? Gani don 't rob people , Challenger . They are headhunters and cannibals . Then you were attacked by someone else but who else ? Oh , we can discus that later . Right now we have to get up ... to these savages and we 'd better hurry . Exquisite monsieur Blum . Our dear friend Blum was the finest chef in all of Europe . Until he chose to give it up for a life of travel . Boulavant , secret terrine . What did you get the ingredients for all of this ? Same place I got that newspaper . - The finest shops of Paris . - I don 't believe you . No ? Then , what do you believe ? You stole that newspaper just like ... you stole everything else including the food . And who did we steel it from ? Maybe you attacked and robbed the search party ... that was looking for us the lost Challenger Expedition . Such a fine imagination ! I assure you ... that 5 weeks ago we were in Paris ... and I know exactly how to get back there . Draw me a map , right here and now . I 'll do better than that , I 'll show you the way . What about my friends ? They would like to go home too . A sudden surge of loyalty in you surprises me , Marguerite . But ... to show that I have your best interests at heart , join us ... and I 'll leave your friends a map . Or more if you asked for . With us you 'll be completely free to pursue your appetites . Whatever they might be . It 's all sounds too perfect to be true . I think it 's me you really want . What man could resist such a divine creature ? I rest my case . No sign of Marguerite . Unless ... Oh ! come on ! - Come on . - Damn , take it easy . Easy old man . Raptor . - Marguerite must have eluded them . - And where is she ? Oh , why the hell did I let her go ? If she made it back to the tree house , Veronica would have ... signal us with the mirrors I ... Exactly , she must be still out here . It 'll be dark soon . I don 't care , I 'll search all night if I have to . Coming ? Go , go ! Yia , yia ! I see you made your decision . Charming as you are I hate to overstay my welcome . Oh , well . I did my best . I 'll take you back to your undeserving friends , first thing in the morning . I wasn 't really a guest at all , was I ? I 'm your prisoner . It 'll be dark quite soon . And you know as well as I do what happened as night out there , Marguerite . So , go if you must . Unfortunately the horses stay with us . First light you 'll take me back ! Right after breakfast . Belgian waffles and eggs a la blame And all the riches you have . Go ! Go ! Marguerite ! Marguerite ! John , we 've been going around a circles for hours . First Summerlee , then Malone , now Marguerite ! I 'm not giving up until I find her , Challenger . God help anyone who lays a finger on her , listen ! - Horses . - Just one . Oh , easy boy . Oh , easy . Umm , settled back saddle but not rider . Beautiful animal ! Your lady friend is safe for now . But her time is quickly fading . If you want her ... back , load the horse with all the gold and gems you have ... and send it on his way . Someone has kidnapped Marguerite . No , someone has made a very big mistake ! Listen to me you feeble minded off ... I can find a thousand of you in a blink of an eye ! Please , please , I 'll do ever you ask ... And you , you sniveling bagger ... Everything you are , you owed me . I know , I 'm worthless . Less than worthless ! Get away from me ! You make me sick ! Marguerite ! How good of you to join us . What would you like for breakfast ? Your culinary wish is my command . How about a coffee to go ? Quite an argument you had last night . A slight misunderstanding , nothing more . Am I to assume that your ... night on satin sheets has done nothing to swap your mind ? I slept like a queen ... now I 'd like to return to my people . You still don 't believe we know the way out of this plateau . You catch on fast . As you wish . One last cup of coffee ... and then I shall return you to your ... drab companions . What did they mean by all the gold and gems you have . How do they know how much Marguerite has ? How do they know if we only give them half or even a quarter ? We 're going to do exactly as instructed ! Is that clear ? Oh , you 've got to be kidding , she didn 't . I believe in the business they often refer to diamonds as ice . And knowing Marguerite ... The ice is in the ice . She did ! How do we know they 'll actually let her go if we give them all of this ? I 'm not taking any chances , Veronica . Marguerite 's life is at stake . Everything goes on the horse ! Marguerite is not going to be very happy about this ! Hmm . Lady Marguerite Roxton ! Lady Marguerite Roxton ! Do you mind ? Do you really thinks she wants to be your wife ? You find this situation amusing do you ? Not at all ! Good ! Let 's go with it ! True love ! She 's hiding stuff everywhere . Well , let 's just hope that 's enough to get her back . We are going to need a bigger saddle bag to this ride ... - Oh watch this . - What it is ? Beware a trick . I know that handwriting . Ned ! Ned ! where are you ? ... places is going on ? Malone have left us a message . Malone wrote that ? I knew he was alive ! We are not given up on you Ned ! Will find you too ! Let 's hope the beast knows its way . They wouldn 't have sent it if it didn 't . With all this extra-weight it shouldn 't be too hard to follow . Not too closely , probably post a lookout along the way . It 's right ! just make sure we don 't lose its trail . I gather a little extra treasure . Well a radioactive extra treasure , that is . Pitchblende ! 62 percent uranium . The Geiger counter should show the way . We never lose it now . Here you go ! The weigh doesn 't seem to slow it down much . Look ! What kind of phenomenon is this ? You tell me . There 's no hoof prints at all ? No wonder we couldn 't find Marguerite ? Oh , we 'll find her all right . Save again by science . Only if we knew a kind of creatures they were ... Oh whoever they are , they better keep their bloody word ... Whenever you are ready fair damsel your ride awaits . I don 't quite believe it , but lead the way , gentlemen . How can you go back to that horrible jungle cuisine ? And turn your back on all this ? opulence ... Last chance to change your mind . Oh the ransom . Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Ransom ? - Look at all . Rich , I 'm rich . All over again . Obviously your tree house ' cohabitors ... . value your company very highly . Oh , no , you don 't , that 's mine . One step close will be your last . This treasure now belongs to me . Condillac is right . Unless of course you want to join us . Then it 's share and share alike . Oh , you think you 're very clever , don 't you ? Okay ! You want me , here I am , fellow traveler . Unfortunately , the tables have turned . See , how can I trust you ... now that I can plainly see that 's our treasure you 're after . That is my treasure . And you can trust me to the same degree that I trust you ! Finally your passions are aroused . Such fire , such intensity . We 're the same , Marguerite . Two peas in a pod . There still should be plenty of pitchblende in the bag . Enough I trust to get us back to their final destination . - Whoever that might be . - Indeed . A ransom note , a riderless horse that leaves no hoof prints ? Who knows what kind of evil lies ahead ? Or what other advantages they might have ... True enough . Better weapons , greater strength . We 'd best be on our guard . It 's a really cheer me up . Almost time for another shopping spree , Monsieur Condillac . I can 't wait . As soon as we get to London ... I 'm going to buy , buy , buy . And I am going to eat , eat , eat . London ? This time tomorrow , we 'll be off this plateau and on our way . Tomorrow ? The way off the plateau is really that close ? Oh yes ! But even if I told you exactly where it is ... without my help , you 'd never find it . That 's why I 'm going with you ! I don 't think so , Marguerite . I think it 's best you return to your precious pals . Not any more . My future is with you , and the better life you promised . We must be getting close by now . Shhhhh Raptors . No , no guns . - I said no guns . - And where 's that leave me ? - John , I have no choice . - Damn it , Challenger ! If these bandits are close enough to hear the shot , they 'll now be warned we 're coming . Shoot it , shoot it Challenger ! - Shoot it ! Challenger ! - You said , no guns . Just shoot the damn thing ! So much for the element of surprise . So , they hear the shot , they know we are coming ... but they 've already got the ransom ... and if that 's what they want I see no need for confrontation at all . Yeah , well I hope you 're right . They are in the next valley . They 'll be here in less than an hour . How did they follow the horse ? Your comrades are more resourceful than I thought . - We 'll have to kill them all . - What ? - Time for an ambush ! - Kind of what I like . Bad for the digestion but great for the appetite . Condillac you get up in the trees on that side . Blum you 'll take this side , I 'll circle around the back . They 'll be dead before they even know what hit them . No one needs to die . - They don 't ? - We just have to get away ? Surely you won 't deny my companions a little harmless entertainment . Harmless ? Come on . What the devil do we have here ? That looks deserted Be careful , it could be a trap . They could be in the tents . Oh , perhaps , just move slowly . What this is ? what 's going on ? Must be some kind of mirage . Marguerite ! Where 's Marguerite ? There ! Marguerite ! She didn 't look like a hostage . More like an accomplice . Once again the horses have left no trail to follow . Fortunately the pitchblende is holding up . The tents , the whole bloody camp , What 's happened to it all ? Maybe it was a mirage like Challenger suggested . The horses were real enough , we tied Marguerite 's treasure to one of them . That 's true . Three men in seventeenth century costumes . I don 't know what to make of it . And what do they want with Marguerite . She looked pretty happy to me , I think she 's decided to abandon us . Marguerite did not abandoned us , Veronica . And you know it ! I know that she hasn 't so far . This is curious . They obviously left this behind on purpose so we could find it . That 's Olmec ! The trickster god of the Checo tribe . Who were they ? They lived on the plateau thousands of years ago . My parents came across the ruined temple . Trickster god ? Would someone care to explain ? More like Esau , and Hermes , and the ... Coyote is to the North American Indians . Olmec tricks people , tempting them with their greatest desires . Testing their moral fortitude , and more often than not , leading them to ruin . Malone warned us of this ! Beware of the trick , he said . That 's right . The hideous laughter ... the disappearing tents , the horses that don 't leave any hoof prints . Must as I hate to admit this , I believe we are dealing with some kind of supernatural powers . What are you suggesting he left this ... thing as a warning ? More likely to taunt us , because that 's the job the trickster god does best . Double back ! be sure we are not followed this time . Why did we stop here ? This is what you could never find without me . A way off the plateau . What are you talking about ? there isn 't anything here . Exactly . Olmec , the trickster , what kind of game is he playing with Marguerite ? Blast ! must them can loose . Ah terrific ! Now what ? So far , they 've been heading East . I suggest we split up . Circling ahead , heading in that direction . Rendezvous in a couple of hours . To two hours due East of here . I suppose I owe you some kind of explanation . The truth will be nice . I am immortal . Here we go again . Spirit of the forest in human form , and unless I die by violent means , I 'll live forever , never age . Nice work if you can get it . This plateau is my home , where it all began . And I can travel through time and space ... as easily as you walk through this forest . Of course , and you have proof of all this . Right ? As you shall see . Now that you have decided to join us , you too will become immortal , like Condillac and Blum before you . you made them immortal . Condillac was a greedy little accountant , when I first met him some 300 years ago . And Blum , Blum was Louis the fourteenth chef . There have been many others . Why have you chosen me ? I enjoy people who like to pursue their passions . Especially when their passions happen to benefit me . Blum loves to cook , Condillac needs all the money in the world . And me ? What is my passion ? Wealth , power , and survival at any cost . You 're the most like me . You know , I don 't believe a word you 're saying , don 't you ? Then I shall just have to show you . You see him ? No where in sight . Must being lucky last time . Even luckier this time , on your knees . Get down ! Through away the weapons , Do it ! No need to be hostile . Your lady friend made her own decision , - just as we did . - Quiet ! What are you going to do to us ? You 're taking us to Marguerite Drop it ! I saw them running of the hill I got here as quick as I could . It 's all right . We still got this one . I 'll go see back and signal Challenger . What is this place ? This was once a beautiful temple built in my honor . - How do you do that ? - I don 't know . How very strange ... Assuming everything you say ... actually is possible ... how do you propose to make me immortal ? I have the power in my hands , As soon as Condillac and Blum return , we can begin . Is this ritual ... painful in any way ? Painful ? No . Not really . How ? , not really . All these questions , Marguerite . I thought we 'd reach some kind of understanding . Sorry . Must have missed that part . As I trust you , so you must now trust me . Well ... yes ... of course , I do . - With your life . - My life ? To become immortal , first you must die . He 's going to kill her ? It 's the only way to become immortal . It 's incredible but it works . Immortal are we . Let 's see . No please , please , I 'm immortal . Unless I should die by violent means . - Even better - Take it easy , Roxton . You can trade me for her . Olmec is only having fun with her . So he is the trickster god . No , Locke . I mean Locke . What have we here ? One of Olmec 's victims by the looks of it . Well , now that I finally have something to bargain with . I 'm hoping for a more peaceful solution . Pray that we get there in time . Let 's go ! How will I die ? Idle curiosity ? Or you finally beginning to accept the fate you 've chosen ? Gets in Mr. Immortality . Timing is everything . Let me go . You can find another companion . Probably one that is a lot less trouble . It 's out my hands . Why give up Blum for her , when she doesn 't even want to go ? He 's right . You should trade me for your chef . I 'm a terrible cook . Chef 's are as plentiful as sheep . I 'll soon find another . A woman of your fine qualities ... that 's a much rarer thing . I will fight you every step of the way ! It isn 't worth it ! Immortality changes people . Blum 's been faithful to you for almost three hundred years . If you 're so concerned about Blum , why don 't you go save him yourself . Maybe I 'll just shoot her dead myself ! - How dare ... - Get away from me ! I gave your immortality and I can take it away again . - Is that what you want . - No ! Go away with the horses . Forgive me . Sometimes emotions run a little high . I 'll forgive you if you let me go . No ! Blum will be leading your friends this way . - We 'd better hurry . - Marguerite ! Marguerite ! - Right this way my lady . - Marguerite ! - Where are they ? - No sign of the horses . Marguerite ! Marguerite ! No ! No ! We 're too late ! What do you mean we 're too late ! Don 't you see , they 're headed for the portal ! We 've got to stop them ! Come on ! Hurry ! Portal ? What the hell is he talking about ? I don 't know , but we 'd better go after him . Where is he taking us ? I don 't know , but he 's in a desperate hurry . - What 's the matter ? - I don 't like this . I 'm going back . You stay on him . Oh come on . Drowning is relatively painless Condillac and Blum can vouch for that . You drowned them ? I made them immortal , and now they are mine forever . - Who are you ? - Don 't you know ? Haven 't you figured it out , yet ? I am Olmec , of the Checo people . They tried to vanish me but I tricked them . I laughed as I watched them die . Brother against brother , man against woman , They slaughtered each other . And I danced in their blood . They are right behind me . Where is Olmec ? Still on the temple with that damn woman . I create a diversion - You go round back . - All right . Take my treasure , all of it ! Just let me go ! I don 't your jewels , Marguerite , I want your heart and soul . You 'll live forever , ravaged by your passions , consumed by your lust for ... power and material possession ... . No ! Please , No ! You 'll have the rest of eternity to ... regret the choice you made . NO ! Marguerite ! Breathe ! Breathe ! You mean nothing to this woman . She abandoned you for gold . How many pieces you are cut into . Where is your sense of humor ? Very good . You should have let her go . Never ! AH ! Ah ! You shot me . - I was aiming for your heart . - Is that any way to say goodbye ? Now go . Before I change my mind . Thank you ! Are you okay ? I am now . My gems ! Where are they ? There is one of them . Drop your guns ! Time to go ! No . Hold it ! Right there . Shoot him ! He 's got my treasure . Get off the horse ! You know I can 't miss from here . It 's an open portal ! London ! Way off the plateau . You had your chance . Au revoir Marguerite ! Damn ! You would have died to go through there ? Not me , I 'm happy where I am . So is she . She 's just upset about losing her jewelry ... Yes . Well , that 's what quite and scape Marguerite ! Oh , I 've never want to see this place again . You know , I had no idea who he really was . Malone tried to warn us . Malone did ? Yes , he wrote a message on the table at the treehouse . Yes . Beware of cads and silver-tongued devils . OH Olmec left you this . How very generous . His intentions were to destroy you , just like he destroyed the others with him . I 'd consider yourself lucky . Lucky ? I lost my entire treasure ! Take it ! Not quite . - What 's that ? - A secret . Perhaps your most precious treasure of all . You think I want to be your wife ? I think there 's a lot of ... things you want to keep well hidden . Lady Marguerite Roxton , I wasn 't thinking of you . I was thinking of your fortune . I 'll keep it as evidence , just the same .

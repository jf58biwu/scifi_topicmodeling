 Previously on Farscape . The ability to create a stable wormhole travel through space and time would be ... Profitable . Probably . You made me think you were my father ! Show me what you really look like . On our travel to the new world , we saw this . Your module , being flown through an unstable wormhole , piloted by this creature . Who the hell is that ? Are you saying this is a duplication ? Scorpius didn 't copy your module . So who did it ? What do you think ? Furlow . Got a nice detailed scan last time you were here . Put ' em on . Flare 's coming . How do you know ? I can sense them . Talyn is blinded and so am I ! Here they come ! If it isn 't my favorite flyboy . Just couldn 't stay away from me , huh ? You fear me . - No , you just smell . He did tell me that there 's a Scarran Dreadnought heading for this planet . It will arrive within six arns . How much data did they get ? Oh , enough to make their own Phase Stabilizer , but I guarantee , the Dreadnought will still get here . Charrid cowards couldn 't hit a pregnant lobboth ! I knew about the stuff you guys put in my head . How ? - Guy named Scorpius . He discovered the info was there and he put a neurochip in my head to extract the information . I will fight you and I will win . Officer Sun . What luscious lips , amongst other things . Crichton was a very lucky man . Where is he ? Gone . Gambled and lost . Oh ... And now , on Farscape ... How unfortunate you must lose as well . And Zhaan gave herself for you . What a waste , wouldn 't you say ? Well . That 's hardly sporting , is it ? I should have a weapon as well . Then we can settle this . One-on-one . Don 't . It 's not easy , is it ? Putting a pulse blast in John Crichton ? You 're not John . Not up here , no . But the rest of his body 's intact . Be a shame to spoil it with that . I 'm much more reasonable than John is . He didn 't want to share his mind with me , but I 'm more than willing to share his body with you . No ! Stand clear . No , don 't ! It isn 't John . - It is John . Look . Thank you , Daddy . Look at him . The clone is dying . He wants you to shoot him so John dies , too . Officer Sun . Next time , be more decisive . Shoot ... quicker . A soldier ... must not be weak . Weakness means defeat . Hey , baby . He 's gone . He 's finally gone . It 's just me . Can anyone hear me ? Aeryn ? Crichton ? Rygel ? Forget the comms ! Run a check on all the airlocks and docking bays . What for ? Damage , malfunction , anything . - Why ? Because I know this ship and ... and something is out of balance . You 're imagining things ... although this is strange . - What ? Docking Bay Two recently performed an atmosphere replenish as if it had been opened . But we landed the Pod in Bay One . Talyn ! Seal all hatches ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . I 've had Scorpy in my head for so long that I 've gotten used to it , and ... and not having him ... it 's like being in pain your whole life and suddenly it 's gone . Jack , I managed to find some e - transmitter coils . They 'll need a bit of work . This is it ? Can 't find anything better ? I had to search half the complex just to find that . Then search the other half , Furlow . John ? It 's time to go to work . If you 're feeling strong enough . I 'm good . But , ah , you 'd better unlock that wormhole information inside my head . I just did . You did ? Really ? It doesn 't happen instantaneously . Your mind couldn 't process all those equations at once . Give it a little time . That 's not good . Man , that one was closer . Who are you ? Merely commerce traders , seeking repairs for our ship . This is some sort of Peacekeeper ship . Tell no lies . Are you a Peacekeeper ? What is your rank ? I am ... I am not a Peacekeeper . I have no rank . How did you get this ship ? I will tell you . He stole it . - What ? Uh , he was a captain but now he 's a renegade . He stole this Leviathan mutant from the Peacekeepers , and now they want him dead . They want all of us dead . Who are you ? I 'm a Banik slave . His slave . And I hate him . He brought me on board this ship to help him fix it . Kill him and make me your slave . Kill him ? Is this is the truth ? Yes , yes ! Every word ! Make this ship operational . And I 'll grant you an easy death . You sure this thing 's unlocked ? I 'm not feeling any smarter . Give it some time . All right , but something better kick in before that Dreadnought gets here . It will . This may require an oscillation damper . Here ya go . Use that . Perfect . Thanks . Why 'd you pick this one ? You said you wanted an oscillation damper . I figured you could modify the rillon valve . I can . But how did you know that ? That 's cool . Oh ! What ... what happened ? What happened to you ? Piece of shrapnel . Why are we still here ? Where the yotz is Talyn ? Don 't know . The comms are still out . Here , I 'll take over . No , no , you 're still mobile . I 'm not . Just bring me food ! You want to eat now ? Bring me food , and I 'll keep going . - It 's starting to make sense . - It 's all coming together . Well , we still need an inversion loop , and I don 't have the right parts to build it . Sure you do . Use this to set up the resonance , and this to flip it . Good . What an elegant solution . I couldn 't accomplish this without you . Jack , what the hell are we building ? A Displacement Engine . Yeah , and whatever it is will take out a Scarran Dreadnought . Yes . And then ? What do you mean ? I mean , how far are you gonna take this ? Is this the end , or are you going to try to put all the toothpaste back in the tube ? I doubt that 's possible . But you 're going to give it the old college try , aren 't ya ? You 're going to kill me , Furlow and Aeryn . Aeryn poses no threat . Furlow ? I 'm uncertain . And what about me ? I no longer doubt your intentions , John . Coils are almost ready . What 's the tolerance ? Lurg three . Close as I can get ' em . Should be close enough . Rygel 's keeping the Charrids at bay , but barely . Where do we stand ? - We 're almost done . I need a quarter arn . I have to install the partanium and build the emitter array . I want you to stay clear of this hangar until I give the okay . I don 't want you exposed to this radiation . Well , I can check the area outside the hangar doors again . You want some company ? - Sure . I still can 't raise Talyn . And the Dreadnought is due in what , two more arns ? We may not even have that much time . - You think they 're in trouble ? Or Scarrans will send an advance scout unit before committing the main force . Like what ? A Prowler detail ? Anything from a one-man stealth capsule to a full fighter squad . But with Talyn blinded , they may be upon him before he can Starburst away . Well , hell . We didn 't have enough to worry about . Furlow ! Here you go . This all you need ? Yeah . This case could be stronger . Eeh ... Don 't worry , I haven 't initiated the partanium reaction yet . Uh-huh . When you do , just in case something goes wrong , where is the emergency shutdown control ? There isn 't one . Once the device is activated , you can 't shut it down . Then what does it do ? Blow up ? You building a bomb here , Jack ? Not at all . After 1.4 arns , a meltdown occurs and destroys the device . So , you only got one shot at whatever it is this thing does . That 's all I should need . I 'm launching soon . You 're flying the module ? Yes . Does Johnny know about this ? No , and I don 't want to have an argument with him about it . As soon as he and Aeryn give the all-clear from the outside , I want you to open those hangar doors . Now , go on . Well , go on . I 'm about to start the reactor . I can 't let you do that , Jack . Back off . This is the only chance we have to keep the Scarrans from ... From paying me a lot of money . Now ... You ain 't goin ' nowhere . You had to kill him ? He would have made a useful prize . You think he 'd have cooperated ? Forget it . This , my friend , is the prize . Ha ... What is it ? Well , it 's a , um ... I don 't exactly know what it is , but I do know that our friend here seemed to think that it could kill a Dreadnought . Ha , it hardly seems finished . No , sure it is . Just a little here ... there ... ya know . Anyway , you know , I really think we oughtta scoot while we got the chance . Agreed . Excuse me , ah , where are you going ? Cause , ah , see , I ... I 'm the one who 's flying the Module here , not ... not you . Incorrect . No , come on , you know . I need you guys to cover me when I retreat , and ... No . See , we don 't trust you any longer . What ? 'Cause you 've allowed too many of us to die . I had to do that , you know ? Don 't you get it ? If they knew I was on your side , then ... We 're not sure whose side you 're on ! I will fly the module alone . You , reattach that to the module ! Hm ! Jack ! Charrids . They snuck in . I nailed them , but ... They got Jack . No . No , no , no , no . It 's okay . It 's okay . Jack . I 'll finish it . We 'll keep your Ancients safe and sound . What happened ? How did they get in ? You tell me . I thought you and the short one were supposed to be guarding the place . Well , what about your supposed booby traps ? What about them ? I think you should check them . Fine . I will . John , we have two arns at most before the Dreadnought gets here . Can you operate this device ? It 's not finished . Can you finish it ? I 'm not even sure what it does . Well , you have to . I ... I thought that the knowledge was starting to open up in you . Maybe I 'll pick it up as I go along . Talyn 's senses are beginning to recover . Once they do , he can target the Scarran and shoot him . It will take heavy and prolonged fire to bring down a Scarran . He won 't just stand there ... - Work ! Work ! I can find no Pilot on board this Leviathan . There isn 't one . It doesn 't need it . There is a direct interface . Stark ! Let him speak . Shut up ! The best way to operate this ship is via a Neural Transponder . Look . Here 's the socket . You see ? His transponder was damaged so we had to remove it . But the ship can construct a replacement . You will have the ship make one for me . Yes , yes . Whatever you say . I had to tell him . He would have forced it out of you anyway . You did well . Instruct Talyn to prepare a Neural Transponder . Two , in fact . Two ? One for me and one for the Scarran . It 's gonna work . It 's all coming together . I got it . Aeryn , I got it . It all fits . Everything fits . I ... I ... I know how to do this . I ... I ... I can build this thing . I know what it does . Can it destroy the Dreadnought ? Um ... It could destroy a planet . Jack . All right , he 's built it so it self-destructs after one use . That 's ... that 's good . That 's smart . Big hole in the sewage outlet . Think I might have found where the Charrids got in . Did you seal it ? With what ? I 'll seal it . Feeble Sebacean . You believe that even with vessels like this , you can defeat Scarrans ? Slave . The Neural Transponder ? Soon . Nearly finished . Soon . It will give me absolute control of the ship ? Yes , yes . You will think as one . Assist your captain . Yes , yes . How many other people have this weapon ? No one . That 's right . Gettin ' the idea ? Elucitin capacitor . See , ah , we can sell it to everyone as deterrents . Give it to no one and charge 'em to maintain the balance . Or , of course , we could just keep it ourselves and find a peaceful application . Furlow , is it always about the money ? Is there anything else ? I mean , how much sex can you have ? I don 't know . I haven 't maxed out yet . The Scarrans have your data . That 's a blueprint that has to be destroyed . Okay , so we use this box to stop 'em , but later , we talk business . You help me and I will make you Miss 21st Century Wormhole . Outstanding . Now , what 'd ya need ? Clear a launch path . Get rid of that crap . Comin ' right up . Tight fit through the exit portals . Shield doors don 't open all the way . You better go eyeball the angle or you 'll shear off a wingtip for sure . All right . So ... partners ? Partners . There 's still plenty of them out there . Enough of them to squeeze us into a crossfire . Why haven 't they ? Furlow ? Furlow ! Come on in , John . Around the front , so I don 't have to twist my neck . This is a big mistake . If you wanna save your life , you 're gonna have to cooperate . I know it looks great on you but ... two fingers . Pistol . And , uh , goggles . Drop ' em . Now step on ' em . There 's a Scarran Dreadnought on the way . Where you gonna go , Furlow ? To meet ' em . To save my life . You know , when the Scarrans get this baby they 'll go away . Don 't do this . Wormhole full of reasons why I should . And no upside in crossing the Scarrans . I got to go while I got cover . Don 't stand in my way , John . Aeryn ! Why have they stopped shelling ? What are we missing ? What ? What 's that ? It 's John . Frell ! - Cover us . John ! Furlow 's with the Scarrans . That would explain why the Charrids have stayed on the perimeter . Explains a lot of things . You know , we are running out of time . We still got time . You know , this new knowledge you 've got in your head ? Yeah . - Can you use it to get home ? Yeah . - Let 's do what we have to do here and then we 'll go . What the ... Frell . You 'll never guess . It doesn 't work ? - No ! How the hell can we have the only gun on the planet that doesn 't work ? ! It 's your fault ! - My fault ? Well you know if I was here on my own , it would be working right now . Well I hope you got a plan , baby , 'cause I 'm fresh out of ideas . Drive straight . - Straight ? ! It 's a plan . He has to follow our tracks . All right , you get Furlow . I 've got your back . I love you . Love you . Run away . Be smart . Run away . Should 'a run . You know , you shoulda git while you had the chance . You should have done the right thing . How well you know me ? You think I like the Scarrans ? They sent in the Charrids , slaughtered my crew , tortured me ... You think I faked all my wounds ? Turn around and walk away . I 'd rather be dead , John . Too old to start over . Got nothing left . Won 't leave without that . Furlow , I don 't have time for this . Oh , damn ! Ready . Where is the Neural Transponder ? Why do I not yet have control of this vessel ? Because , because , because I 'm still ... Ah , these controls ! See for yourself . Are you subverting my commands ? No , truly ... Scarran . I subvert your commands . You deny me the Transponder ? Do you still want it ? Without delay . Then ... you shall have it . Talyn ! Fire ! Crais ! Get down ! Thank you . It may not happen again . Furlow , look . The device . It 's active . You can 't shut it off . By the time you get it to the Scarrans , it 'll be useless . It 'll be slag . - Frell ! I can 't deactivate it , but you got to let me use it to take out the Dreadnought . Casing 's open , John . I can close it . Uh-uh . It 's too late already . The reaction 's building too fast . I think we both better get outta here . No , you go . Don 't be the hero , John . Always be the one to walk away while the hero dies . That 's my motto . Okay . Okay , one ... Two ... Three . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . We have to hurry . Crichton . Aeryn . Rygel . What is your status ? Frelled . Mivonks on a plate . Frelled . What 's your status ? - I am partially sighted . Talyn has recovered sufficiently to attempt Starburst . Well , pick me up and let 's go ! Crichton ? Aeryn ? Crais . We got one shot at this . The , uh , Displacement Engine will take out the Scarrans . You need to pick up Sparky and get the hell out of here . Yes . Starburst immediately . No . It is unanimous . We stay . Oh dammit , Crais , knock it off . You 're gonna make me start liking you . Is there anything we can do ? Yeah . It would be helpful to have the Dreadnought directly in line with the mouth of the wormhole . What wormhole ? The one I 'm about to rustle up . We will attempt to lure them . Good fortune . John ? Are you hurt ? No . No , I 'm fine . What happened ? What did she do to you ? No , she didn 't do anything . - What 's the matter ? She didn 't ... What is the matter ? Radiation . Massive radiation . I couldn 't ... help it . I couldn 't stop it . There has to be something you can do . No , I have to finish this . You 're finished here . I 'm flying the mission . Aeryn , you don 't know what to do . - You will talk me through it . You will get help and you will not argue with me on this one . Dammit ! This is not something I can coach you through . It 's half intuition , it 's half feel and I know it like I invented it . So it 's your life for everyone else 's . And you 're different ? How ? I 'm different because I love you . Then you know I have to do this . I 'm coming back . Scarran Dreadnought , this is Captain Bialar Crais . Peacekeeper . Approach any closer , you will be engaged and destroyed . They must be terrified . Crais , where is it ? I can 't see that damn Dreadnought anywhere . Closing fast on an intercept vector with Talyn . But , Crichton , there is no wormhole to maneuver them . Oh , there 's my flare . Mama Crichton 's baby boy makin ' wormholes . Close ... Close ... Very close . This is ... We 're being targeted . What was that ? I destroyed Furlow 's lab . There 's nothing left . Okay , Displacement Engine , time to displace . Scarran Dreadnought . Withhold your fire . We surrender . I repeat , we surrender . Talyn , stand down your weaponry . Make them believe . Draw them in . John . I 'm almost there . The wormhole is touching the star . It 's touching the star . Okay , Jack . This one 's for you . I have no prayer for that . John , are you ... Yeah . Baby , I 'm ... I 'm still here . Told you I 'd come back . The ... radiation sickness treatments from Talyn 's emergency kit should ... Relax . It was a big hit . Nothing to be done . And I hate long goodbyes . Your sacrifice does not go unnoted , Commander . Crais ... You ... find the better part of yourself . You ... have to take care of them . I will . I ... hope you can believe that . Goodbye , Crichton . Hey , hey , hey , Sparky . They say it 's not good . Sparky , come here . My stuff . You can 't have it . It will be hard not to think of you . I 'm gonna miss you , Dominar . Stark . It 's okay . I 'm very angry . Me , too . We had good times . I wouldn 't change it for the world . You made me ... a better person . That wasn 't hard . I love you . So much . I love you . I would have gone to Earth . I 'm sorry you never got to meet my dad . My real dad , I mean . Sorry I never met your dad . I 'm sorry about a lot of things . No . Don 't be . I don 't want you to go that way . I won 't . Huh . What ? They say ... it 's a lucky or an unambitious man who goes when he 's ready . That said , Scorpius is gone . I 'm at peace . I don 't hurt . I ... I did some good things . I 'm proud of my life . And I 'm with you . Don 't worry about me . I 've never felt better .

 The Cryonic Woman Giant space robot , this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express ship . We come in peace . Tough luck ! We destroyed the toy spaceship . Now what ? - The keys to the real spaceship ! - Think we should ? Yes , I do . Have you seen the keys to the spaceship ? I left them onboard . I mean , what ? ! Relax . The ship won 't go anywhere . I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether . Hey , Fry ! I 'm steering with my ass ! The best thing I ever saw ! - That was great ! - And no one suspects a thing ! And that 's how we learned our lesson . You 've gone too far this time . All three of you ! - What did I do ? - You left the keys ! Look at them . Wasn 't it obvious what would happen ? - Yeah , Leela . - We 're very disappointed in you . I should fire you three right now but I 'm just not that cold-hearted . You 're all fired ! Goodbye , friends . I 'll miss you . Good riddance ! Now Zoidberg is the popular one ! Yes ! Let 's all talk to Zoidberg . So , Zoidberg , what 's new ? Oh , you know ... What about money ? All I 've got is my first mustache and a picture of my old girlfriend , Michelle and that ski instructor who 's just her friend . Pardon me , brother . Care to donate to the anti-mugging-you fund ? We don 't need to beg . We 're not veterans . What do you suggest ? A robbery of Fort Knox on elephant back ? Dumbest thing I ever heard . - No . We can get jobs . - But we just had jobs ! I still have our old career chips . - Our what ? - Career chips . Remember ? They assign you the job you 're best at . I tried to give you one and you ran away ? - It 's how we met ? - Then what happened ? Just give me your hand . Baby . I 'd like my old job counseling defrostees and assigning them careers . I was hoping you 'd come back . I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays . He lives for the weekend . Put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip . Calcutta , we have a problem . Delivery boy ? I must have mixed up the chips . Here 's our cryogenic counselor ! Do you like Mondays ? - They 're okay . - Then we 'll redecorate your office . How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here ? Let 's see what it says about me ! Welcome aboard , sir ! Remember , when the tube opens , say : " Welcome to the world of tomorrow ! " I was frozen . I think I know what defrostees want to hear . Bathroom 's that way . Tell me what brings you to the future . I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured time was cyclical . Nope . Straight line . - The probulator 's done . - That wasn 't so bad . Oh , wait , it hasn 't started yet . Okay , it 's about to start . Welcome to the future , human slave ! Relax , chum . I 'm not really a giant fly . I 'm a horrible robot ! Kill all humans ! He 's having a heart attack ! - They 'll find a cure in the future . - We have a cure now ! Good . Then you won 't mind if I use this . Nothing like a power nap . Oh , flies , flies and gorillas ! Stay beautiful , doll-face ! That probulator sure knows how to please a man ! So , what 's for lunch ? I ordered a pizza . Pizza delivery for l.C. Wiener . Very funny . Now cough up the $ 12.95 . - After half an hour , it 's free . - It 's only been 23 minutes . Well , I 've got 33 minutes . It 's only been 23 minutes , you dumb cannoli ! You got a problem , let 's take it outside ! Okay . I 'll fight the box . I can take him . Just pay me . I owe 30 bucks on this uniform . Thirty five , you stupid meatball ! Who should we unfreeze next ? No . No ! Oh , my God , it 's Pauly Shore ! All right ! I loved you in Bio-Dome . You sure made trouble in that bubble . If it rhymes , I can cause trouble in it . Now that you 're in the future , you can live in an actual bio-dome . An unattractive prospect . While researching for the role , I ran computer simulations demonstrating that the whole concept is fundamentally flawed . Be it expressed via dome , sphere , cube or even the stately tetrahedron , buddy . So how did you wind up getting frozen ? During Encino Man , my intellectual curiosity re : cryogenics was peaked . I resolved to freeze the weasel . The weasel ! I was supposed to be unfrozen for the 1000th anniversary screening of Jury Duty II . How come I 'm not there ? I woke you up early to hang out and do stuff . Like what ? - I love this job . - Me too ! Showtime . I 'll pretend to be dying of space plague . Michelle ? Oh , my God ! Fry ? Is it really you ? I don 't know . Is it really you ? What do you mean ? Are you you , or not ? - Who wants to know ? - Oh , Fry , it is you ! Last time I saw you , you were doing great . You dumped me , and your life was back on track . - Why 'd you freeze yourself ? - Oh , Fry . After you left , things got worse . I got married . I 'm sorry . His name Was Charles . His law school Was so prestigious , the basketball coach Was Ruth Bader Ginsburg . I put him through school by Working With antisocial dogs . But soon after Charles graduated , our marriage ran into difficulties . Sorry . I turned to the one thing able to lessen my pain : A carnival . But a corn dog bone got lodged in the control of the Spizzler and I had to ride it for 8 hours . But it did give me a chance to think . I remembered the last time I was truly happy . When I was with you . So you froze yourself to come look for me ? No . I did it for a fresh start . I didn 't know what happened to you . The police searched but your parents felt it was a waste of money . Same reason they kept me out of school . No one cared I was gone ? Not really . Except for one person . Who was it ? Everything is so different ! Not everything . There 's still a roach problem . Now people like art that 's tattooed on fat guys . I 'm on loan from the Louvre . Please , professor . We deserve another chance . And if you won 't give me another chance , perhaps you 'd give one to Og , gorilla emperor of Earth ! Sorry , Og . But I 've got a new crew . How was your delivery to Fantasy Planet where everyone 's fantasies come to life ? - Great ! - Organized ! For one beautiful night , I knew what it was to be a grandmother . Subjugated , yet honored . You see , Og ? Everything 's running smoothly . With Fry fired , I can leave my jigsaw puzzles out . He won 't eat the pieces . Forget about Fry . Hire us back . He 'll never know . Hey , guys ! Hey , Fry ! So , as Leela was saying , Fry can go shove a big , old ... I 'm glad you 're all here . Here 's my ex-girlfriend of the past 1000 years , Michelle . Michelle , this is Leela . This is Bender . The professor . - Hermes and Amy . - Nice to meet you . And this is Dr. Zoidberg . Dating your ex , Fry ? - Have you lost all self-respect ? - All what ? - It can end badly . Kids , a house ... - Home invasion by an old roommate . It 's different now . She was demanding and possessive . Now she wants me to do stuff , be with her . There you go , dearies . It 's a relief to meet you , Amy . It 's hard adjusting to all the strange stuff of the future . I 'm from Mars . I feel so out of place . I don 't understand why Fry fits in so well . Because he didn 't in your time . True . But I used to fit in really well . Then good luck , sister . Don 't take this the Wrong Way . - Your friends are freaks . - Great , huh ? I don 't belong . I don 't know anyone . I can 't find vanishing cream that won 't make me really vanish . - I don 't have a job . - I 'm supposed to assign you one . I 'll get your career chip installed . Hold out your palm . It 's like getting your hand pierced . This world is horrible . Let 's go where all we have is each other . Romantic . I 'll tell Bender to meet us there . It 's not a " there . " It 's a then . The future . I thought you meant a motel where the bed is shaped like stuff . I love you . Don 't you love me ? Sure . To the extent a man can love a woman . But this is a big step . Why must you analyze everything with your relentless logic ? Nothing matters but our love . You 're right . Let 's do this now and never regret it . Michelle , I don 't regret this . But I rue and lament it . The year 4000 is disappointing . I miss 3000 when brains flew through space and people ate lasers . It 's not so bad . Fate brought us together and brought us here . You brought us here . Whine some more . It 's really attractive . Now , build us a shelter . Fine . Everything else sucks . At least we 'll have a nice place to live . - There ! - You expect me to live in a hole ? It 'd be deeper , but I 'm standing on a gopher . - Oh , look . Some little kids ! - They 'll save us ! We 're saved ! I 'm Butch , leader of this place ! I took your hole . You can 't do nothing about it ! Sir , we have nowhere to go . Could we please join your society ? All right . But no interfering with our grand works . Butch runs a good civilization . I 'll enjoy serving under him . You know your problem ? You 're not ambitious . You should be chief . What do I need , ulcers ? I want power . I 'm tired of the chief 's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide . All right . If it 'll make you happy , I 'll overthrow society . On what grounds do you challenge my authority ? I 'm older . I can beat you up . - I 'll bet he could . - He 's got arm hair . All right , Grandpa . There 's only one way to settle this . Death rolling . - What ? - It 's like skateboarding . - Except half the time , someone dies . - So it 's safer than skateboarding . Last one holding the bandanna is the new leader . My mother always said you were a loser . - Now go prove her wrong ! - Beth said that ? It 's cool . Back off ! My knee ! I scraped it ! Poor little guy . Let me just take a look at ... I won ! I 'm the new chief ! I 'm the tallest and I weigh the most ! Hand it over , you giant idiot ! - Butch , your mom 's here ! - Ah , man ! Come on , kids ! You 're late for Hebrew school ! I don 't wanna go . Every Monday and Wednesday 's the same thing . This post-apocalyptic wasteland is very confusing . - Seriously , I 'm weirded out . - That 's because you 're a loser . You were a loser in the year 2000 , you 're a loser in the year 4000 . But in 3000 , I had it all . Friends , a low-paying job , a bed in a robot 's closet ! I envied no man ! But you wrecked everything ! Quit standing up for yourself , Fry ! Back at the hole , we 'll have a boring talk about our relationship ! Oh , yeah ? Listen to this ! I 'm leaving you . There must be people somewhere . Yes ! Footprints ! And handprints ? But what 's happening ? Fry , thank God we found you ! What are you guys doing in the year 4000 ? It 's not 4000 . You were only frozen for two days . I broke your bed . You were in Pauly Shore 's tube . They delivered it to his movie screening . They noticed you weren 't him and threw you out . So these aren 't the decaying ruins of New York in 4000 ? - You wish . You 're in Los Angeles ! - But there were kids with guns . Exactly . You 're in L.A. - Everyone shoots at each other . - That 's L.A. ! - There 's no sign of civilization . - Stop with the social commentary . The people are phony . No one reads . Everything has cilantro on it ... - Michelle , baby ! - It 's not working out , Fry . Tis better to have loved and lost , n 'est-ce pas ? I 've had it with women . I 'm gonna concentrate on my career . Can I have my job back ? I 've forgotten why I even fired you . He destroyed your business and all your possessions . Oh , that 's right . Get lost !

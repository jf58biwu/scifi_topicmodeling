 Previously on Farscape . What is the matter ? Radiation . Massive radiation . I love you . The ah , other Crichton . He 's dead . Hello , John . Oh , my friend . I ... this is difficult , isn 't it ? You 're jealous of the other you . He died . Now Aeryn thinks that you 're the copy . Peacekeepers . They 're your problem . Don 't let Scorpius crack this . Whatever it takes . I 'm going to the Command Carrier . I 'm going to stop Scorpius . Good luck , John . And now on Farscape . I 'm a squillion metras from anywhere I wanna be . Then come with me . I can 't . Jool , your friends are negotiating with Peacekeepers . You stay here , you 'll end up dead . I 'm sure on the medical facility , there 'll be someone who can help you find your home . Aeryn aboard ? Just finished her reconnaissance . The ship on approach is definitely a medical facility . It is unarmed , five or six hundred on board . And they 'll take our Scarran . Let 's get Naj Gil out of here before they change their minds . You all right ? Any word from D 'Argo and Rygel ? No , they 're out of range . So after we leave here , we 're really going to do this ? There 's no turning back . We 're ... We 're gonna go on a Command Carrier with Scorpius . Well , that 's the plan , if they can hammer out a deal . Scorpius doesn 't deal . Rygel thinks he will . But ... but you know what ? It doesn 't matter because I won 't be here . I 'm splittin ' Crichton . The next planet we pass . Peacekeepers . I ... I see Peacekeepers . You know , I don 't think Scorpius is going to show . He 'll show . Eat , calm down . No , I can 't . I smell a double cross . How can you smell anything with these ganoks on the table ? Try one . No . How can you eat that ? It smells like pralt . They 're our specialty . People come from planets you 've never heard of , just to eat our marjools . Look , can you please just get out of my way ? Go , go ! Go ! - Ah , they 're here . Lieutenant . Just the two of you ? No others ? Correct . Where 's Scorpius ? Ah , the Luxan . And the Dominar . You 're late . I presume you 're both unarmed . That was the deal . Yes , it was . Shall we get down to business ? Not yet . Rygel , move ! It 's a trap ! Lieutenant . Prepare to execute them . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Where 's your rescue squad ? Hmm ? Where 's Aeryn Sun ? Get frelled . Not afraid of death ? Oh , just let me finish these . Then please , don 't miss . Aim for the head , hmm ? Look , we 're ready to deal . When you 've finished your little game . I had to make sure you were both ... alone . Mmm , of course . Weapons down . So ... You weren 't really going to kill us ? Of course not . Are you certain about that ? Quite . Ah , Ka-D 'Argo . If you knockout another , there 'll be no soldiers to carry these three back to the ship . He 's right . We 're here to talk . Okay . But I want no Comms and no more surprises . Now get these tralks out of here before you start to waste ... any more of my time . Hmm . - Withdraw to the ship . - Await our return . - Peacekeepers ! - Well , what are we gonna do ? - Get the frellhezmana out of here . I 'm not going out there . No way . Vooodi ! Oh , zangblats ! Shh ! We gotta run , Esssk . We gotta run . What ? Run where ? Where ? ! Like we 've got somewhere to run ? Naj Gil ! Has he gone yet ? Yeah , the Transport Pod just left for the Med Ship . What are you doing ? Listen Chi , I 've got nothing against the Peacekeepers . I was never a prisoner . So you guys want to fight ' em , or stop ' em , or whatever it is you 're planning , fine . Good luck . But I 'm leaving . Ah , you 're going on the Med Ship ? Yup . Naj Gil said they 'd check out my eye , and then they 're gonna take me home . You can 't go . Why not ? Because I saw myself mourning for you . Okay . One , I don 't think you can see dren , and two , it 's really none of ... Let me understand . You wish to board my Command Carrier ? You want full amnesty and relocation to your own planets as free citizens . And in return , Crichton will help me in my wormhole research ? That 's about the short of it , yes . And why would Crichton do this ? Do you know who the Charrids are ? Yes . Not very friendly towards Hynerians , if I recall . The Charrids have formed an alliance with the Scarrans . I am aware of the political situation . The Scarrans ' goal is to build wormhole technology . We stopped them , but it won 't be long until they start again . So Crichton has a choice , and he would rather you had it than them . We 've got to get them out of here . So what are you gonna do ? Esssk , I 've got to tell you something . Oh , don 't worry . This could turn out good . If you cook ' em the greatest Leearvink ever , maybe ... we could get a Peacekeeper supply contract ... No , we 're going to get killed . No , no , no . Why would they kill us ? I ... I don 't know how to make Leearvink . I haven 't got the skills . You do . You do . You were a great chef once , Vooodi . You ... can do it . Crichton , Aeryn , there are Peacekeepers approaching . I knew it . I knew Peacekeepers were coming . Come on . Come on . What , did you see that too ? Is there anything you don 't see ? - Nice . Talyn has also spotted the Peacekeeper craft . A Prowler and a Marauder . Pilot , give us immediate Starburst ! We cannot Starburst until we are clear of the Medical Facility . Talyn , prime the main canon . Identify targets and stay calm . Stay calm , Talyn . Are the Peacekeepers here to find us ? I don 't know . - Crichton , it 's Scorpius . - He sent them . I told you . I told you they would screw us . That means that D 'Argo and Rygel are dead . Pip , we do not know that . What are you doing ? You bitch , I could be gone . I could be on that Med Ship . But no , you had to see things . And then you punched me ! Prime main canons only . Do not fire until my signal . Peacekeeper ships in visual range . Moya senses they 've targeted us . We don 't have any choice . Do it now , Crais . Talyn , fire at will . Pilot , status of the Peacekeeper vessels ? They are no longer on Moya 's scans . Good work , Talyn . Starburst in 50 microts . The Hospital Craft is moving away and its Commander sends us his gratitude for destroying the Peacekeepers ' ships . Wait , wait , Talyn . The Med Ship is not a threat . What is he doing , Crais ? - No , Talyn ! The Med Ship is not a threat ! Crais , what is going on out there ? No , Talyn ! No , Talyn , no ! Power down now ! You ! There were innocent people aboard that ship ! Naj Gil ! - I know . There was nothing I could do . Talyn attacked on his own accord . You coulda stopped him . - Jool . Somehow , you coulda stopped him . Now they 're dead . Six hundred souls . And you ! You knew . No . I ... I only saw myself in mourning . I thought it was for you . Pilot , why haven 't we Starburst ? Peacekeepers are sure to send out another patrol . I 'm afraid ... Moya is now refusing to move . Why ? Since Talyn powered down , I can 't contact him . He 's not responding to my Comms . And Moya is refusing to abandon him . We are agreed . You will all board my Command Carrier . We 're not quite finished yet . We will need a guarantee for our safety when we 're onboard your ship . And I 'm afraid we 'll need something more tangible than reassuring words . I - Yensch bracelets . Sir . Put one on , Braca . Ka-D 'Argo ? If you will . What does it do ? This gets you onboard my ship . We have almost closed the deal . Put it on . That 's easy for you to say . Do you feel anything ? No . Braca , pay homage to the Dominar . What ? I invite you , Dominar , to attack the Lieutenant . I have no quarrel with him . Humor me . Synchronized nerve impulses . Those wearing the bracelets will feel each other 's pain . If one is injured , then both will be . Very good . And if one is killed ? Both will be dead . Uh huh . The bracelets seem acceptable , but who wears them ? Well , Crichton , of course . And my second in command , Braca . Braca ! You would not hesitate to kill him . I will not wear an I - Yensch bracelet . Crichton wears one , you wear one . Each of us gets to configure the arming sequence so we can be assured there 's no tampering . The only way we 'll trust you , Scorpius , is if we know we can control you . Unacceptable . Then we have no deal . So be it . Get down ! Down ! This is a robbery . How many more are there , huh ? There 's no one ! No one ? Get over there ! - No one . Manon , grillas , whatever you 've got . Give it to me in a pile , nice and slow . I have nothing . Sko ! I 'm trying to tell you something . I know . They 're Peacekeeper officers . Who gives a frell ? He never told us about the Peacekeepers . You . You ! Up , up , up , up . We go out there now ... your troops ... they shoot us in the head . How many ? How many are there ? None . A liar ! Peacekeeper Officer can 't even stiv without his troops . I can stiv on my own , thank you very much . Up , up . Up , up , up . Up ! You , Comm them . Tell them show themselves . Hands up in the air . I have no Comms . The Luxan destroyed them . Why did you hit me ? ! Wh-What did I do ? You , just go . Cook ! - What ? Now , you go help him cook . Now ! What ? - I don 't care what ! Go , go , go . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? What 's going on ? ! What 's going on ? That 's a long story , frell-jek . Talyn is in shock . He has expressed absolute remorse for his mistake . Six hundred dead . That 's a little more than a mistake , Crais . Yes . And I believe that unless we act , it may happen again . What will happen again ? Extreme paranoia . Reactions unwarranted to the situation . Talyn is a danger to himself , as well as us . Crais , what do you wanna do ? I believe ... we should shut down all his mechanoid systems . Stay calm , Moya . We 're just discussing a plan . No one 's doing anything yet . Are you talking about killing Talyn ? Of course not . His biologics will remain on artificial support . But we must get him to a place where the anomalies in his character can be repaired . Then you 'll bring him back ? With full system replacement . When he comes back , will he still be Talyn ? No . He will be , uh ... different . Brand new . But something has to be done . Moya must know that . 600 innocents have just lost their lives . Moya is aware that Talyn has acted irrationally . I will speak to her . Alone . Uh ... Could I offer a suggestion ? Shut up ! Why don 't you forget the robbery and think bigger ? If I were you , I 'd hold the Peacekeepers for ransom . Let us go . You don 't need us . But they 'll pay anything to get those two back . Rygel , shut up ! This robbery doesn 't seem to be turning out like you planned . If you had a plan which ... don 't get upset , doesn 't seem to be the case . We 're doing fine . This is fine ? I 'd hate to see when you do badly . When we burn this place down , I 'll make sure you 're in it ! Burn it down ? I thought you were robbing it . This isn 't a robbery , is it ? It 's for insurance . Garanzai currency , yes ? Before , you said he didn 't tell us there would be Peacekeepers here . It 's the cook . You 're burning it down for the cook . Vooodi , get out here now ! We 've got your food . Get it out of my face ! - We 've got Leearvink . I 'll just put it over there , okay ? Maybe your friend will ... He knows . What did you tell him ? What did you tell him ? ! What did you tell him ? ! Tell what ? The worm knows . Vooodi hired us to burn this place down . You did what ? I would have told you . I should have , Esssk , but ... You want to burn this ? - But ... I wanted to tell you ... But I love this place , Voodi ! - I should have told you ! Shut up ! Shut up ! What have you been doing ? Have you been telling him my life story ? I didn 't . He guessed . He came up with a better plan . Instead of doing the insurance job , we take these two for ransom instead . - I wouldn 't do that . We don 't care what you 'd do . Look , we 've got the guns . We 're in control . And we 're gonna be rich . Rich ! Rich , Rich , Rich ! No you won 't . Talyn has activated a full lockdown . He 's not letting Crais on board . Moya is still refusing to move . She won 't even talk to Pilot . What do you think we should do ? You 're asking me ? Yes . We can still work together , John . We always did that well . The only voice that Talyn is gonna listen to is Moya . Someone needs to talk to her and convince her that we 're not hurting Talyn because we want to . I think ... maybe you should talk to Moya . She knows that you love Talyn . There 's nothing I can do . Moya knows Talyn 's acting irrationally , but she believes he will heal himself . May I speak with her ? I 'll ask . Moya will listen to you . Proceed . Hello , Moya . Talyn has been our home , and on more than one occasion , he has saved our lives . I personally have shared with him some of the best and also some of the worst times . You must know that I would never harm him . Crais is right . We have to shut Talyn down , and it is for his own good . And I swear that we will all work to bring him back just as he was . It is the only way . - I can handle Peacekeepers . - I know what they 'll do . They 'll send out a Prowler , maybe two . But I 'll keep this gun at your head to make sure there 's no funny ganak . Then you 'll organize a ransom and get them to give you a very fast ship ? That 's right . The moment you Comm them , you 're dead . And you won 't even see them coming . Why risk it , when you have a far greater prize here and you don 't even know it ? Behold , Rygel the Sixteenth , Sovereign of Hyneria , heir to all of its wealth and fabled star planets . He , you should ransom . Talyn 's agreed to let Crais reboard and start his work . I sense Talyn waking up from lockdown and powering up . Thank Moya for us , Pilot . I think it best to leave Moya alone . She knows what we do is necessary , but still ... she is heartbroken . She 's not the only one . Crais ? What 's Talyn doing ? He 's aiming at us . Start evasive procedures . - Shut down , Talyn ! Shut down ! Evasive procedures now ! Must ... stay awake . No , no sleep . No sleep . No sleep ! He needs water . Ah , shut up ! He 's not important . Let the hostages die . Brilliant negotiating position . Oh , you 're the only one we care about little slime toad . Now , shut up ! While we figure out what to do next . He needs water now . Imbecile . Bring me water ! And bring me food ! I left your Leearvink on the table . Well , that Leearvink 's cold . You should bring me some more . Your bravery is convincing . Yes . I think he bought it . They want more Leearvink . Come on ! Why don 't they stick their Leearvink up their fekik ? ! No , no , no , why don 't we put a frelling sign out the front ? Huh ? Huh ? Yeah ? " Leearvink not done here ! " What sign ? You were gonna burn the place down , Vooodi . - No ! This place is killing us . Don 't you understand that ? Esssk , I want to start over . I want to start over together . I 've been thinking about it . We shouldn 't kill anyone . We should just burn the place down . If we do this ransom thing , - you know someone 's gonna ... - ... end up dead . Have you looked in the mirror lately ? Are you getting any younger ? No ! We take the score that 's fallen in our lap . We market the runt . We have only a limited window before they discover no one will pay a kretmar for you . That 's your fault . You told them to ransom me . If they 'd Commed in a Peacekeeper squad like you suggested , it 's quite likely one of us would have died at the hands of these idiots ! No , uh ... we do this ourselves . If you 're up to it . I know the combination to Braca 's bracelet . While holding two lights continuously , depress 3-1-4 . Then release all . Hmm ... Give us a hand here , Princess . I can 't believe Talyn blew up Moya . I 'm sure it was an accident . Bet he was really aiming for you . We are the only ones who can help you . Talyn , please . Talyn , please ! Bay Three Hangar is opening . Talyn is letting us dock . Okay , here 's what we do . We call your people , we ... ask for ten million kretmars ransom . We leave . We wait . They come . When they come , we arrange the exchange . His ship will decode the transmission . Ha . So ? We 'll be metras away . In something that can outrun an attack Marauder ? Oh , he 's right , you know . Oh , why so difficult ? Uh , we could take my ship . It 's fast . They won 't ever catch us . Good . But he 's ... the only one that can fly it . I don 't believe you . It 's true . Responds to DNA particles and voice ident . Why so difficult ? ! Here ! Vooodi 's made you more Leearvink . Smells like krank ! You get me something I can eat ! Let go ! Don 't fight me , bitch ! - You hurting me ! Oh ! Get the frell outta here ! I want you gone now ! Now ! Get back to the kitchen ! No , this is my place ! You work for me now . Burn it some other time . I don 't care . Just get out of here ! Now ! I 'm warning you . Vooodi ! Why ? I wanted to give you something . Vooodi . Burn this place down in my honor . Braca 's I-Yensch ... hold two continuously as you press ... Ah , ah , ah , ah . Oh ... Slime Finger . What are you doing ? Helping keep this man alive . Oh , no , you 're not ! Get back over there . Yes , yes . Press 3-1-4 . Mm ... Talyn ? You know what must happen next . He 's right , Talyn . Talyn , you listen to me . You destroyed a ship with many innocent people onboard . You shot your own mother . You would never do that , unless you were sick and frightened . When Moya told you what we had to do , you panicked and struck out . I don 't think you really meant to hurt Moya . You could have destroyed her if you wanted to , but you didn 't . Just as I 'm hoping that you don 't really want to hurt us , because we don 't want to hurt you . Talyn , you know you 're sick . You let us board . Now , I don 't want you to be frightened . You 're not going to die . You 'll be reborn . It 's a fresh start . Please , Talyn . Let us take away your pain . Stay awake . Stay awake ! Stay awake . - Please , Sko , no more killing . - We should just get out of here . No ! No ! We are too far in . So . You ! Yes ? You were meeting with him , weren 't you ? Why ? To negotiate our freedom . We 're escaped prisoners . Oh , really ? ! Really ? ! Uh-huh . So , you don 't like Peacekeepers either . Not in the slightest . This one 's the most valuable ? Higher even than a Captain . Look . No insignia . So . We take him in your ship . We have better chance of escaping , eh ? Mmm ... Come ! Come , come , Slimey ! Wa ! Wa ! Aim at the Hynerian . What ? Well , pull the trigger . Kill the Peacekeeper . I 'll trust you , and we 'll both be happy . Pull the trigger . Kill him now , or Wa kills you . Pull the trigger ! I 'm waiting . I told you before . If I kill him , D 'Argo dies . If D 'Argo dies , no one can fly the ship . If no one can fly the ship , you don 't go anywhere . Pull the trigger ! You want me to kill someone so you 'll trust me ? How about ... Dominar ... Butcher . You said this one was more valuable . That was a microt ago . All right . Right . We 're outta here . Oh , why not just kill everyone ? Everyone . There 's a knife under the Leearvink . You okay ? Fine . Listen , Crais and I can wrap it up from here . I can finish the job . I know . But if you want to go back to Moya ... I don 't . But thank you . Are you ready ? Yeah . Crais ? We 're ready now . Yes , Talyn . I promise you that I will do everything I can and Crichton and Aeryn will as well . We 're all here with you . You have not disappointed me . I don 't hold you responsible . Neither does Moya . Oh , no , no . On the contrary , Talyn . You are very brave . As you wish . He 's gone . Get him up . - I 'm trying to keep him awake . If you want me to pilot that ship for you , he must remain conscious . Waitress . Waitress ! Time to join your cook boyfriend . No . I 'll get you all the currency you could ever want . Leave her alone . Go back in the kitchen . Don 't come out again . Where are you going ? Need a kill souvenir . Want to help ? Ah , sick toad . We have to go . Just give me a microt . Sorry I had to shoot you , but you know how it goes . How did you know I was wearing body armor ? I wasn 't sure , but ... 131 cycles in Peacekeeper captivity teaches you a few things . And what if you were wrong ? Well , not so bad for me either way . Plan ? We can 't leave with them , or we 're all dead . There 's a knife under the plate . It 's on the floor in front of the counter . Hynerian ! Almost done . His ears are tougher than I thought . You got anything to contribute ? The silver one . Hurry . Single pulse charge . You 've only got one . Good luck . Be there . Hynerian ! Get off . Get over there ! I 've changed my mind . What ? ! What ? ! I 'm not going with you . You can kill those two if you like . Why , you dirty little ... Ah ! What 's this about ? Regrets . I 'd rather be dead than deal with the likes of you . Oh , why so difficult ? ! Because you didn 't think it through , fekkik . You didn 't have a plan . What 's that ? What 's that there ? What 's that you 've got ? ! My leg ! Get it off my leg ! Kill them all ! D 'Argo ... D 'Argo . What ? Are you all right ? Ah , I 'm fine . I 've got a , uh ... I 've got a hard skull . I just think I 'll , uh ... Now , about our deal . Yes . I believe perhaps ... there is a basis for us to trust one another . Mmm . Mmm . Mmm . Ah ! So , you 're all right ? As well as can be expected . D 'Argo 's hurt his leg , his head , and burnt his hand . But he 'll survive . What happened to you guys ? Why didn 't you call in ? Well , the restaurant , it , uh ... it sort of burned down . I don 't want to talk about it . It 's a long story . Anything happen here on Moya ? Oh , yeah . Just the usual . Rygel , do we have a deal ? Oh , very much . I 'm proud to say I 've secured everything we wanted , including acceptable security precautions . I have a bad feeling . About the Command Carrier . Do you think we shouldn 't go ? I don 't think we have a choice . If Scorpius masters wormholes then ... Yeah , some things you die for . I just can 't watch that happen again . It was perfect . We were so ... perfect and you 're just like him . I mean , you are him . No . I 'm me . I was here . I missed that dance . Aeryn . Don 't come with us . No , we started this together , Crichton . That 's how we 'll end it .

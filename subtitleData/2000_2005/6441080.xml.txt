This has become problematic , hasn 't it ? Will you be able to continue the tests from here on ? Do you know the whereabouts of the psychics ? We are currently investigating that . I 'm going to say this just in case , but under the current circumstances , our donations are going to have to come to a halt ... Please wait a moment ! You should already have enough to buy the title of head of the church , right ? It 's not like your location is the only place that we 've requested to make adjustments to the machines , after all . I am aware of this ... What is it ? Lord Ghibelline , you have a visitor ... Tell them to come back later . You see ... he says his name is Kai Kudou ... Episode Eighteen Same Bed , Different Dreams I 'm amazed you came back ... What could you possibly have to say to me at this point ? With the release of Raphael and the others as my condition , I will search for the Sacrament of Calvaria . Don 't you have the order backwards ? I 'm sure that I said that if you found the Sacrament , I 'd release them . I will find the Sacrament , no matter what . In exchange , I want you to promise to not lay a hand on Raphael and the others . If any of them are harmed , then I will have no problem with using my powers ! Is that supposed to be a threat ? All you have to do is leave Raphael and the others alone ... That 's all I wanted to say . I promise ... Kai , I 've come to get you . Let 's go home together . Shin-lu ! You didn 't come back to Ashurum , so I came to get you . Shin-lu , you came here by yourself ? That 's right . Was that bad ? No , it 's not bad or anything , but ... Hold on one second . Kai , you like crepes with chocolate and bananas inside them , right ? Here you go . Thanks ... I used to make them , and we ate them a lot , right , Kai ? Oh yeah , you promised to come with me next time to an all-you-can-eat cake buffet . Do you remember ? Despite that , before I knew it , you had settled down in Gald ... I 've got it ! How about going to the cake buffet right now ? Come on , let 's do that ! Shin-lu , don 't you remember ? Remember what ? That I 'm not good with sweet things ... There you go again ! I won 't be fooled ! You know you love them a lot ! Why won 't you come back to Ashurum ? There 's still ... something I have to do . Huh ... Is it more important than me ? Kai , you always said that I was the most important person to you , right ? You would make me warm cocoa after our training sessions , you would cover for my mistakes ... have you forgotten all of that ? Kai ... you 've forgotten it all ... Okay , I understand . Then I 'll make you remember ! Shin-lu ? Beneath the rainbow colored sky I 'm being blown about by the wind It 's overflowing my heart I want to send it to you , this feeling I only looked at you My throbbing heart won 't stop I want you to look only at me Shin-lu ! What 's wrong , Shin-lu ? The throbbing of my heart is painful You 're always staring far away Beneath the rainbow colored sky At this rate , the town will ... Beneath the rainbow colored sky Beneath the rainbow colored sky I 'm singing into the wi ... Stop this , Shin-lu ! Kai ? Kyou ? Yes , yes yes ! You 're Miss Asuka Tokugawa , yes ? Nice to meet you ... " Nice to meet you ? " What ? But ... Who ... are you ? I wonder if she would think I was strange if I said " we 've met before , haven 't we ? " to her ... Nice to meet you . What are you up to , Kyou ? ! Mind your own business ! Can you say that the two of you playing house is your mission ? ! Yahoo ! Kyou ! Don 't you lay a hand on my Kai ! Get out of the way . You 'll be blown away too ! Shin-lu ! What 's wrong , Kai Kudou ? Come at me ! Let 's have a good time , just us psychics . That 's why you lured me out to this deserted area , right ? You 're not what the rumors make you out to be , are you , Kai Kudou ? If you don 't put up resistance at least once , then it 's not any fun . He 's just pretending to be weak . He wasn 't like this before ! He was proud of using his powers ! Isn 't that right , Kai ? Kai , you 're the one that taught me to control my powers . Huh . So then he controlled them too much , and they 've gone off somewhere ? Shut up . I 'll do it . Hmph . Now who 's interfering ? Kai , look at me . What ? I want you to see my power ! Stop it , Shin-lu ! Did you see it ? It 's incomparable to before , isn 't it ? I want you to be sure to feel how much stronger I 've become ! Shin ... Stop it , Shin-lu ! I have no reason to fight you ! This is a lesson , Kai . Just like when me , you , and Shen-long trained together . We fought one another to increase our powers . You remember , right ? We never did ... anything like that ... Kyou ! I said that I would do it ! Your constant babbling is annoying ! I 'm sorry to have caused a racket . Umm ... I dropped the cookie jar onto the floor ... They 've ended up like this , but they 're really tasty cookies . They go really well with either tea or milk ... Oh , what fell on the floor was just the jar . The cookies didn 't fall on the floor , so ... Is it all right if I have some ? Yes ! It 's delicious . Thank goodness . I wonder what he would do ... if she wasn 't here ... I think that Yuuki will be coming back from his work soon ... Did I ... say something strange ? No , it 's nothing , I 'm sorry . Umm ... My name is Maria . The reason I came here today wasn 't to see Yuuki , it was to see you . Me ? There 's someone I want you to rescue . Won 't you please come with me ? What ? Why me ? Wait ... Huh ? Wait ... Huh ? Don 't leave this room . All right ? Okay ? Who 's that ? She 's different from the woman in the picture . Woman in the picture ? Are they saying they 're after Asuka ? There 's fire ... Is she a psychic ? If you don 't want to get burned , then lay down your guns and leave this place ! I don 't know what organization you 're with , but I won 't let you lay a single finger on her . They never said someone like this would be here ! Calm down ! Nothing around us is burning . This is just an illusion she 's showing us ! I 'm telling you to leave . If I wish it , this blue flame will turn red , and you both will burn . Your hair and your bones , everything . Nothing will be left ... Should I test it out on one of you ? Wait a second , we were just hired to do this ! And we were told to bring the woman back unharmed . We have no intentions of killing her ! Who hired you ? Ask them a little more nicely . These old guys are scared , you know ? Maxim ! Let go of me ! Hey now ... That wasn 't smart ... I 'm sure that you 're not into burning people to death ... Damn it ! Were these men ... hired by our organization ? Or is this something you 're doing on your own ? I 'm just doing as the people at the top me tell me to . You 're the one that 's getting in the organization 's way . Are you saying that this violent method is an order from the top ? There 's no way ! Did you know that because of that attitude , you 've distanced yourself quite a bit from the organization ? Use full force to remove any obstacles to carrying out your mission ... That was also in my orders from the top . Are you saying that I 'm an obstacle ? I don 't know what your actual power level is , but I don 't have the feeling that I 'm going to lose . Here I come ! It would be best to be careful ... that 's a battle field for when psychics fight each other ... This man ... is used to fighting other psychics ... He 's maintaining such a powerful shield , and yet his attack power isn 't wavering at all ... Asuka ! No ! Let go of me ! Let go ! Silence ... you 're going to come along with us quietly ... Whoa there . Yuuki ... Are you all right , Asuka ? Yeah ... Eep ! So the landlord 's back . Asuka , are you all right ? Yuuki ... Asuka ! So that 's how it is ... Yuuki , that 's not it ! Quiet , you . Yuuki ... Under these circumstances , it 's no wonder that he thinks that it 's that way , right , Maria ? No ! Maxim , stop it ! This is my mission . Let her go . Yuuki ! Yuuki ! Yuuki ! Yuuki ! Why you ... Isn 't it good that you haven 't found what our organization contracted you to find yet ? Don 't mess with me ... Everything you 're saying is getting on my nerves ! Yuuki ! Stop it ! Don 't do horrible things to Yuuki ! Let go of me ! Yuuki ! Hold on , Yuuki ! Go back ... Are you turning on us ? I won 't turn on the organization ... I understand ... I 'll tell the guys at the top that you 'll be courteously bringing her back using your methods . You ... Yuuki ! Yuuki ! It 's all right , he 's just unconscious ... I 'm sorry ... What a boring guy ! Is it any fun just guarding yourself ? Shin-lu ! Come on ! Kyou ! You 're more useful than I thought ! That was uncalled for , you jerk ! Kai ? What are you doing , Shin-lu ? ! That 's right ... what am I doing ? What are you , stupid ? ! Shin-lu ... Kai ... what was I ... It 's all right , you weren 't doing anything ... I was fighting you just now , wasn 't I ? Shin-Lu ... Why was I doing something like that ? Why ? Shin-Lu ... Why was I doing something like that ? Why ? Who are you ? ! Don 't order me around ! No , no ! Shin-lu ? Shin-lu ! No , don 't come any closer ! Someone is ordering me to fight you , Kai ! Someone is saying to ! Don 't ... bother us anymore . Shen-long ...

 He 's been hit hard . Crais . Talyn 's supposedly the meanest , deadliest fighter ship , but somebody 's beat the yotz out of him . That 's not Moya . Let 's find the parts to fix the Transport Pod and get the frell out of here . Help ! The grey girl . Very nice . And tasty . Hold the door ! Crichton , get in ! I doubled you . I twinned you . Equal and original . Now on Farscape : Pilot , can 't you keep the environmentals under control ? Transfusing Talyn is a severe drain upon Moya . Flying in this turbulent atmosphere is even more taxing . I know it 's not as bad as the last time . It 's not the Cro-Magnon copy of the Alien Nation reject , but you can tell I 'm the original , right ? Wrong . I 'm the original . Try again , pal . Have you been messing with my stuff ? That 's my stuff . And you are the clone . Aeryn , you can tell ... - You can see the difference . No , I ... I can 't . Right . Here . You wear that , so I can tell the two of you apart . Wait . Why do I have to wear it ? Because you 're closer . I want to help you sort this all out , but we have bigger problems right now . Talyn is dying . But Pilot thinks the Chromextin will fix Talyn up , right ? If D 'Argo can find it on the planet . You shoulda gone down with him . Screw you . I 'm not gonna leave Crais alone on Moya . He is comatose and locked in a medical stabilizer . He does not need guarding from either of you . I don 't trust him . And what if he 's lying ? Fine . You go and keep an eye on Crais , and you go to Talyn and help Stark . Excuse me , why me ? Excellent . Can you also provide us with the quantities we require ? Yes . I believe we can do business . How much Chromextin did you want ? Uh , six lennerts . For which we 'll pay handsomely . Still , a transaction of that magnitude will need the approval of the Security Director . And he dislikes off-worlders , especially with reputations such as yours . Reputations ? Us ? What 's this ? New talent ? Didn 't know Jennet was hiring exotics these days . I don 't work here . Well , maybe we 'll give you a try anyway . Don 't move . I 'll get it for you , hmm ? Did you hear me ? I tried . I tried not to start any trouble . Well , you 're not in any trouble . Well , you are . Every frelling planet . Where are you going ? We still have business . Not anymore . Who do you think that was ? Oh , yotz . Not the Security Director ? Good luck getting any Chromextin on this planet . Wait . If you think we 're leaving empty handed ... You 'll be lucky to leave at all . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . No propulsion , no overrides , no weapons . All bad . Talyn 's so still , so near death . Even the DRDs are still . I didn 't know he had DRDs . He builds them as he grows . Come on . The primary conduit nexus is completely overloaded . That 's why nothing works . What about the neural link to Crais ? The link ? Yes , that 's operating . Crais 's autonomic functions may be the only thing that 's keeping Talyn going . Here , here . - That the conduit ? Yeah , yeah . What if you 've got this backwards ? What if we pull Crais 's transponder ? He dies and Talyn lives ? Tried that . Nearly killed Talyn . We can 't break the link . We 've got to fix the conduit and restore Talyn 's caloric flow , so wake him up . Anything ? Yes . I 'm hungry and there 's nothing sweet on this ship . I was talking about your patient . Well , the lortinol injection I gave him seems to be having no effect whatsoever . I thought you knew something about medicine . I do . I 'll have you know I earned T - ratings in genetics , neuroscience and xenobiology . Good . That 's what I thought . What are you doing ? Zhaan took some tissue and DNA samples from me awhile back . I want you to compare ' em to me and the clone , and figure out that I 'm the real thing and he 's the wannabe . And why should I do your selfish and unnecessary work ? Because I know where Rygel stashes his womilin cake . And it 's sweeter than a sweet thing , sweet thing . Give it to me . Mmm , yes . Whatever are you are , release me ! Aeryn ! Maintenance Bay ! Crais ! Let her go . There . I woke him up . Now I hope he drops dead . Crichton . Am I on Moya ? John , what 's ... - It 's okay . What ? Aeryn Sun ? Yeah , you missed that bit . You 're alive . How ? Let 's skip the back story right now . What happened to your ship ? Where 's Talyn ? I can barely sense him . He is alive , but unresponsive . Moya is supplying nutrients . Where are we ? In open space ? Low planetary orbit . Talyn and Moya found an atmosphere with a very high nelvastatic index . That may conceal us . Who did you piss off this time ? Talyn and I were not the aggressors . Course not . You never are . So who is it ? The Plakavoids ? The Skeksis ? Big bad wolf ? Peacekeepers . They want Talyn back . The Luxan will be disciplined . I apologize for his behavior . According to some witnesses , he has nothing to apologize for . You saying I was at fault ? Father , these are known criminals . The path of destruction they leave gave us ... Don 't believe those myths . You know how rumors get started . Then you deny your reputation ? I deny its relevance . We 're here for one reason , to buy Chromextin . Ooh ! Why do you need such a large amount ? Oh ... mmmm . Medical purposes , hmm ? Chromextin has no medical function . None that you know of , brother . But it can power weapons . Should we sell them ammunition they can use to attack us ? Hmm ? Their warships ? Our ammunition ? We have no warships . Then why hide your vessels in the densest layer of our bonosphere ? To avoid conflict . I understand that , as this planet 's ruler , you must protect its people . Be assured we pose you no threat . Allow us this simple transaction , and you 'll never see us again . I see no reason not to accommodate them . I see no reason to let them live . Force is your answer to everything . Better than weak , mindless pacifism ... Stop ! We 'll not do business with you . Tolven , they have one arn to break orbit . But ... - After that , force is authorized . May I show you out ? We were attempting to resupply , but we were ambushed by four Prowlers using strike and retreat tactics . You don 't believe me , Crichton . Only because I know you . Pilot , I 'm accessing Talyn 's logs . Please display the signal for us . Very well , Crais . Talyn destroyed one Prowler , but their attack was merely a diversion . That ship is a Panthak class Vigilante . Yes . Surprising us with an Immobilizer Pulse , severely overloading all Talyn 's systems and dissipating his energy . We barely broke free initiating Starburst but that drained the last of Talyn 's power . I remember nothing further . A Vigilante with an Immobiliser Pulse . What attacked Talyn was a Retrieval Squad . They will not relent until they recapture Talyn . And to force Talyn 's surrender , they wouldn 't hesitate to take Moya hostage . I will return to Talyn so that Moya can flee immediately . With Talyn 's condition worsening , Moya will not abandon him and neither will we . All right . Start up the Pod . We 're leaving . D 'Argo ? Chiana ? Where are you ? A Refreshment House . We 're trying to find another source . Perhaps you don 't realize but we 've been given one arn to leave . With or without you , I 'm returning to Moya . You aren 't going anywhere . What ? What have you done with the Pod ? Well , nothing you can fix . Did I lose consciousness again ? Briefly . Is Crichton present ? Shall I summon him ? No . There is something I deeply wish to share with you . Talyn was designed with intelligence gathering facilities . He and I have been able to tap into high level Peacekeeper comm channels , accessing their central database . Including your personnel file , where I found ... this . Aeryn , wake up . Wake up , Aeryn . Don 't be afraid . My name is Xhalax Sun . I 'm your mother . But you mustn 't reveal to anyone that I was here . Do you understand ? I came to tell you something . Aeryn , your life was not an accident . And it wasn 't an assigned birthing to fill the ranks . Talyn , that 's your father 's name . He and I chose to have you . You were conceived in love . Our love . I wanted you to know this . It makes you special . We wanted you . And we love you . Go back to sleep now . My mother ? Yes . I was never sure whether I dreamt that . And that was on my file ? And hers as well . I thought it might interest you to learn of your parents . And my father . Was he ... Did you ... I could find no information whatever about him . Was my mother court-martialed ? There are gaps in her service record . However , its last entry notes her promotion into an elite battle group . Aeryn ... - Let me guess . The Retrieval Squad . She is somehow part of it . The squad is under the command of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun . Remove your lower garments and face away from me . What the hell for ? Oh , you asked me . If you want a genetic comparison I need a specimen . Of what ? Well , skin . Unless you prefer I test your internal organs . You can stay the hell away from my organs , lady . Well , skin then . Preferably something with the least amount of exposure to solar radiation . Shoulder . I use SPF 30 ... No ! Thank you . Recon Stations report the probe has not left the planet . And their other ships ? Still concealed in the bonosphere . Probes detect an unidentified mass in geosynchronous orbit . Coordinates precise enough to target ? Airborne Defense says not yet . They suggest concussion missiles . Well have them fire at will . Oh ! It 's not working , it 's not helping ! Talyn 's dying , not waking up . Astro . Work now , freak later . Work now ... Oh , yeah ... Yes ... that 's fair . Good . How much later ? Pilot ! Missiles , launched from the planet . Exploding in the atmosphere . Aeryn , I 'm going to Command . You stay with Captain Crunched . What about me ? Pilot , get the planet on the blower . I can 't . The nelvastatic cloud cover blocks communications as well as scans . They can 't establish a missile lock , so they 're trying to flush us out . Take us up , out of range . No , Pilot . If we ascend out of the bonosphere , we may be revealing ourselves to the Retrieval Squad . Ah , hell , I can 't see a damn thing in this soup . Moya is attempting to extend her senses further , but ... Oh , there 's another one . Brace for the shockwave . Noble Talyn , I stand ready to ease your passage into death . Knock that off and help me get weapons back on line ! Why don 't you listen ? The weapons console won 't function . Crais , are you still in contact with Talyn ? Can you get his weapons working ? He has insufficient energy to fire . Well can he do anything ? Can he point the damn guns ? I believe I can enable targeting . Right , do that . Pilot , I want you to take us down . Below the cloud layer ? Do it , Pilot ! I think I know what he 's trying to do . He 's going to need a comms channel . And I 'm gonna need a comms channel . Crais , I want you to find the fattest target you can . Government house , missile site , McDonald 's , whatever . Two ships are descending from the bonosphere . It 's a gunship . We 're being targeted . Now , Crais ! Hello , morons . You see this ship ? Knock off the missile attack , or we 'll take our shot . Prepare another salvo . Oh , you might want to check our resume first . We leveled a Shadow Depository and we 're about to turn your city into glow-in-the-dark sand . Launch missiles . No ! Father ! - No . Airborne defenses stand down . The missiles have ceased . It 's about damn time . Who the hell are you ? Rinic Pralanoth , Sovereign of Kanvia . John Crichton , Wizard of Oz . You ready to knock off the macho B.S. and talk these things out ? I 'm willing to reopen the discussion . Good . I 'll notify my reps . I 'd prefer that you and I spoke face to face . Fine . I 'll come down . My offspring . Rinic Tolven , Security Director . Rinic Sarova , Services Director . So tell me , Rinic , Rinic and Rinic What 's your problem ? We come down here to buy something . We don 't hassle you , we don 't try to take it by force . Hell , we offer to make you rich , and you guys break out the pyrotechnics . Violence was an error on our part . Allowing notorious criminals onto our planet was a worse error . Criminal ? No , no , no . We 're businessmen . Lies . That 's a big word to throw around , son . I can prove it . Get your hands off of me ! Damn it , let me go ! This is not ... not necessary ! What the hell is that ? Get this thing off of me ! Damn , you people got a funky sense of humor . Get this lobster off my head ! It won 't hurt you . Unless you lie to us . It 's a very intuitive creature . It senses brain wave patterns , and is extremely sensitive to cognitive dissonance . You lie , and it knows . And it 's been trained to kill when it detects a lie being told . Why have you come to Kanvia ? To buy Chromextin . Period . For what purpose ? None of your damn business . Nothing that affects you . Are you planning to seize power , hmm ? Or perhaps one of the subcounselors is getting ambitious again . Have you been hired to sabotage our unification ? We could give a damn about your local politics . We 're here to buy the stuff and then get the hell out of Dodge ! Why is that so difficult for you to get through your tiny little brain ? Remove the strannat . Calorics have dropped to critical levels . The Immobilizer Pulse overloaded too many of Talyn 's systems . Repairs alone cannot save him . What can we do ? - Nothing , until the Chromextin arrives . But after that , Aeryn , you must join us . Your mother 's involved now . She 'll take him alive if possible . But I know Talyn . He 'll fight to the death . His or your Mother 's . And you expect me to fight on Talyn 's side ? I hope your presence will provide another solution . She loved you . And if that part of her still lives , only you can find it . She 's an officer . Part of the elite . She is nothing . A thug . A mindless assassin , as you and I once were . But you can give her a chance to be something more than that . Daybreak ? Talyn may be dead by then . It 's the best I could do . The old man says it 's going to take him that long to scrape up six whatevers . Lennerts . - Lennerts . Right . Says there 's not enough in any one single parish , so he 's got to send his deputies out to collect it , and who the hell knows if that 's true . Well , it may be true . I spent the whole day trying to buy some . There wasn 't one source that had the whole amount that we need . I say we just go get the guns and steal the stuff . We would have to complete ten robberies to do that . Yeah . So what 's your point ? Is this a proposition ? John Crichton this is Rinic Sarova . Phone . Oh , hey , hey , hey . Um ... how you doing ? We must speak privately about the Chromextin you require . I fear you 'll never get it . Are you willing to meet me alone ? How about we talk about it right now ? No . There 's a service corridor behind the Refreshment House you 're in . I don 't like it either . Mmm . Shall we go inside ? It 's closed . The door 's locked . I own this Refreshment House . In that case , you can buy me a drink . How can there be a problem ? Your father promised he 'd get us the stuff . My brother objects . He won 't defy my father openly , but he will try to block this transaction somehow . And Daddy can 't keep him leashed ? You think my father 's weak ? - You tell me . Pralanoth unified this planet . He ended the wars between nation states and brought peace to this world . Excepting the occasional missile attack on visiting ships . That was Tolven 's doing . Yeah . Your brother got a death wish ? No , but he wants to rule . Mmm . Meaning he wants Daddy 's job . Yes . However , Pralanoth has decreed that after his death , Tolven and I should share power . Well , your brother doesn 't strike me as the , uh ... sensitive powersharing type . We took an oath that we would co-rule , but I 'm sure that Tolven will disregard it and seize control . Can 't you stop him ? The conflict would fragment this world once again . I would prefer my father saw reason . And put you on top . Tolven suspects this . He also knows he lost face when my father overruled his missile attack . He , uh ... could have lost a whole lot more . You know , you really don 't want to see what our gunship can do . But Tolven would risk it . He is sure to interfere with the Chromextin delivery , hoping to provoke you into attacking us . And he counterattacks , proving to Pop that he was right all along . Yes . I therefore ask for patience . I 've been nothing but patient . And , uh ... I think you need to understand that I 'm under a lot of pressure . I do understand and I will do all I can to hasten the process . Even if it means bypassing normal channels to locate my own source of ... Uh ... Sarova ? I never thought my brother capable of this . Crichton ! - He 's over there . Hey . Don 't pull it out ! Get Crichton away from here . No one must find us together . This meeting never happened . Go . Now ! Rygel ? We 're on our way . Well , hurry up ! Come to finish the task , my brother ? Salvako ! He 's bleeding ! You have a keen grasp of the obvious . Help him . Help him ! How is he ? Don 't know yet . You 're doing fine . Yeah , right . I could be killing him for all you know . A major artery 's been cut . He 's lost a lot of blood . Well then replace . You 're similar species . Are you klemmpt ? Even within my species , the subtypes have to match . My blood is donor incompatible . Take mine . Really ? Yeah , I know , he 's an ugly loudmouth son of a bitch , but I can 't stand around and watch him die . Be better for both of us if you did . Yeah , I know . Now shut up . Well , neither his genetic sample nor yours shows any sign of degradation . You 're both perfect . If that 's the right word . Copies of the original Crichton . Screw your tests . I 'm the original . Of course you are . The other guy said the same thing . Why does this bother you ? Don 't humans have monozygotic double births ? This is different . Twins don 't start out fully formed , sharing the same life . This sucks . It sucks big time . How you doing ? Crappy . On the upside , it 's easier to tell us apart now . D 'Argo filled me in on your adventures with the Gotti family , but I need some details from you . Why ? Because the show must go on . Why won 't you tell me the truth ? Did tell you . You went to the Refreshment House for an after hours drink , alone . Yes . A witness saw a wounded Crichton being taken out after the explosion . Mistaken . Then you deny he was with you ? Give me strannat to prove . Tolven , don 't be ridiculous . Sarova would not lie to me . Morning , all . Ho , ho . And what a beautiful morning it is . How y 'all doing ? We have two , count ' em , two , Transport Pods , on your loading dock ready and waiting ... What the hell happened to you ? A bomb exploded at the Refreshment House . No . Well , hell , who would do such a thing ? You tell us . You were there having a secret meeting with Sarova . No , I wasn 't . You were seen . I have a witness . Who also swore that Crichton was badly wounded . Well maybe his species heals rapidly . Maybe your witness was blitzed . Now , why , other than a social call , would I be having a secret meeting with Sarova ? Well , I have to assume you were conspiring to take power . Perhaps you two were constructing a bomb and it accidentally went off . I want an apology . I want the truth . You can 't handle the ... Oh , let 's cut the crap . Let 's get to the chase , stick this critter on my face . Whoa , ho , ho ! Yeah , look at the suckers on that boy ! Damn , in some parts of the universe this thing would be considered good eating ! Whoo ! Ha , ha ! My name is John Crichton , astronaut . I was not at the Refreshment House after hours . I was not present at any bombing or explosion . I did not have a private meeting with the beautiful Miss Sarova . The end . Cross my heart , smack me dead , stick a lobster on my head . Our money is in the Transport Pods . Can we have our stuff now , please ? Give it to them . Two lennerts are packaged and ready . The rest is still on its way here . Then load it up . Whoa , okay ... Oh . How are you doing ? Jool did good . I 'm all right . Well , Rygel and Chiana have just delivered a partial load of Chromextin to Talyn , and that may boost his kelvo levels enough to bring him out of his paralysis . So , what 's next ? Well , now Crais will divert all of Talyn 's energies into restoring Starburst . Meaning he plans to ditch . He is protecting Talyn . Yeah , you keep saying that . Well , you know , he has saved our lives . He did kill Scorpius . I don 't know what it 's going to take for you to trust him . So you trust him ? Well , whether or not I trust him , this time I do believe him . So what do we do ? Spread it all over the exposed conduits . Rygel , you take the inner hull . Ha ! Do I look like a DRD ? Yeah . You do , actually . So make yourself useful ... Oh , no , no , I don 't want ... - and act like one . Oh , yes , this is a very dark and smelly place . I hate being useful ! Yeah , we know . Where else ? Something has begun . What have you done ? Crais , what 's the matter ? Crais ! Crais ! - Crais ! Crais , what is it ? - Murderers ! Hold him down ! - Help me ! Crais , what 's happening ? Crais , what is it , what 's happening ? Poison ! What went wrong ? Oh , I don 't know . The Chromextin should have acted as a stimulant . Instead , it sent Talyn into convulsions . Well , it 's definitely Chromextin . But apparently , it 's laced with Clorium . What 's Clorium ? An anesthetic that numbs Leviathans . Oh , mixing that with a stimulant probably wasn 't a very good idea . Anyway , glad I could help , but it 's been an extremely long day . Sorry , Jool . We need you to work some overtime . We need you to strain the Clorium out of that stuff . With this equipment , it 's gonna take forever . And even if I was sure of how to do it , which I 'm not ... Pilot ? - Yes , Commander . Can Moya filter out the poison like she did when Aeryn was sick ? Moya is willing to try . You sure it won 't harm Moya ? The Clorium ? Her mass is much greater than Talyn 's . She believes its effects upon her will be minimal . All right , tell Chiana and Jool what to do . I 'm heading back to Talyn . Same here . You open , I 'll pour . Fine . You 're spilling it . - Oh , you wanna pour ? The Retrieval Squad are here . They have to be . I think you 're right . You do know , John , that if we can revive Talyn , we have to Starburst away immediately and we can 't go back . Yeah , I kind of figured that when I saw you packing your bag . We heading down ? Yes . I 'm just going to duck under the bonosphere for a microt , so we can contact them with the news . Oh , that 's gonna make them really happy . You 've been screwin ' me from the beginning . Uh-uh . I don 't think so . Screwin ' everybody . Screwin ' your sister . You been lying to your Daddy , boy , and you know you shouldn 't lie to your Daddy . It 's gonna stop . Who 's your Daddy ? Come on , you know who your Daddy is . Who 's your Daddy ? D 'Argo , tell him who his Daddy is . I 'm your Daddy . That 's right . We 're gonna start tellin the truth . The prosecution calls Mr. Rinic Junior to the stand . Did you poison the Chromextin ? What are you talking about ? It was poisoned with Clorium . Did you contaminate it ? No . You had nothing whatsoever to do with poisoning it ? Nothing whatever . Then who did ? I don 't know . Does this crab thing always work ? In a few rare cases a disciplined mind has managed to fool it . You ... you tell me that now ? But my offspring are not liars . Ha . At the Refreshment House , did you plant the bomb or have it planted ? No and no . But you fired the missiles at our ship . Oh , absolutely . And you didn 't want us to get any Chromextin . Of course . I never thought you should get any . But when I 've been overruled , I 've complied with my father 's orders . Yeah . Ain 't you just a good and loyal son . I 'm sorry , I didn 't hear that . Are you not a good and loyal son ? Tell him . I don 't have to answer to him . But you do have to answer to me . I don 't need to prove myself . Get this thing off me ! Do you hear me ? Do you hear me ? Answer . Father ... Have you been disloyal ? Yes or no ? You swore an oath to this family . Have you dishonored it ? Do you intend to ? No ! Get out of here . Stark , power is returning . Keep splicing those conduits . - Splicing , fixing , fixing . Splicing , splicing , fixing , fixing . Splicing ... Talyn is ... Talyn , can you hear me ? Welcome back . Can he Starburst ? Not yet . But the treatment is working . Calorics are rising . Where are they ? Must be back aboard their ships . All their Transport Pods are gone . Fire concussion missiles . No . Father ... We must avenge Tolven . There 's nothing to avenge . Tolven 's betrayal is what caused his death . Airborne Defense . This is Sarova . About time . - Anything going on ? Okay , here we go again . Talyn can 't take this punishment . Pilot ! We must ascend . But is Talyn recovered enough to Starburst ? Irrelevant now . We cannot stay here . We dare not descend . Release the umbilicals . Moya refuses . She won 't leave Talyn behind . Naturally . If Moya will not disengage , I will . Talyn , listen to me . You must ascend . He 's right , Talyn . Let Moya get to safety . Do not resist me . We 're out of the bonosphere and Moya 's sensing a Peacekeeper scan . Talyn , Starburst immediately . Now , Talyn . Yes , you can . You must . Talyn 's done it . He 's escaped . Prepare for immediate Starburst . Have both ships Starburst away ? They must have discovered the Clorium contamination and filtered it out . How much Chromextin did they get ? Two Lennerts . A third of what they asked for . Then the gunship will remain debilitated for some time . We need only find it . I failed . Aren 't you going to kill me ? Come on . He took Wynonna . Well , at least he left you this lovely jacket . I was wearing that . Oh , come on . Crack a smile , will you ? At least he 's out of your nose . Hair ? That 's what I meant . At least out of your nose hair . My notebook ! He ... he took my notebook and my pen . The son of a bitch set me up . He set it up so that he 's on Talyn with Aeryn . Now , wouldn 't you have done exactly the same thing ? No , I would not . Yes . Maybe , I don 't know . I just ... I just hope he 's having a good time . No , forget that . I hope he 's having a terrible time . I don 't know what I hope . He just better be taking care of her . Oh , I 'm sure he 's taking care of her . You know what I mean . What do you mean , you 're not taking us back to Moya ? Rygel , we can 't go back yet . There will be no contact with Moya until the threat of the Retrieval Squad is resolved . He 's right , Rygel . So we just have to accept it gracefully . Frell gracefully . Well , if I must be in prison here , feed me and show me to my quarters . Talyn 's passenger facility isn 't fully developed yet . Food will be tightly rationed , and you two will have to share accommodation . Unacceptable . There 'll be my side and your side . My side , your side . Don 't start . Look , do you ... do you really know what you 're in for ? Oh , I never do . Is there something that you 're not telling me ? The Retrieval Squad is commanded by my mother . Your mother ? Right . She 's out here , chasing Talyn . Yeah . How do you know that ? Crais told me . Crais ? Look , there are zillions of Peacekeepers . Why would your mother be assigned ? You really think it 's a coincidence ? No . I have to assume that they are aware of my relationship with Talyn , and that they are hoping that my mother 's presence will divide my loyalties . But I will not let them get Talyn back , even if it means I have to kill her .

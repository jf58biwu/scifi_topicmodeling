 Thankyouforthe horse . You liked him ? Oh , it 's beautiful ... but I thought we were going sailing today . You promised . Well , that one 's too old . See , now ? That 'll do . Come on ! Come on , Mr. E. - lt 's broken . - Who says ? Mokelock . Now , Edward , we agreed . No more Mokelock . Mokelock is the bogeyman . Mokelockwants me where l am . We canfix it . Edward . Sing a song of sixpence . Sing a song of sixpence . A pocketfull of rye . Four and twenty blackbirds . Baked in a pie . Rise and shine . Mr. E is doingfine . Did we go sailing ? Almost . Mokelock showed up . Mokelock is the bogeyman . Mokelockwants me where l am . Mokelock is a pain in the ass . Where 'd he get Mokelock again ? Mother Goose . - Henry . - Barry . What 's the matter , Barry ? Edward 's parents are here . He needs a haircut . He loves itwhen you visit . My husband wonders if that 's true . He wants to place Edward in the hospital . I 'm sorry , Catherine . Mr. Baines ... I 've been working on this projectfor seven years . I know , Henry. I know . Please don 'ttake offense , Dr. Kent . Yourwork 's invaluable to this company . Butyou 're not sure about me . We 've waited eighteen months for signs of progress . There has been progress . There 's no proof , Catherine . With all due respect , Mr. Baines ... I 'm notthe one who designed the procedure . I mean , I wish I could take creditfor it , but I can 't . I was chosen to do a job . They picked me . But if you think there 's someone better ... or someone who 's more devoted to your son , then- - No one 's doubting your ability , Catherine . What is it , then ? There 's no proof , Catherine . There 's no proof the procedure works . All you 're giving me is the belief ... thatyour interaction with my son ... is not a ... hallucination . Shit ! I better get backto work . Oh , good-bye , Mrs. Baines . - Thankyou . - Thankyou , Mr. Baines . Come , shall we ? Lucien . Lucky she worships you . Why ? Because he hates me ? I wouldn 't say " hates . " Distrusts , dislikes immensely ... can 't bearthe sight of . What 's the verdict ? Well , we 've got another six months ... and Barry had to pushforthat . I wantto reverse thefeed , Miriam ... now more than ever . We 've been through this a hundred times , Catherine . It 's too risky . Why not ? What do we have to lose ? When I did social work , itwas always better ... when we tookthe kids out of their environment . Foster homes can be scary atfirst ... but eventually they see thatthings can be different . Edward is like that right now . He--he 's living in a world that is not healthy . Let 's show him a different place . All right . Let 's say we do ityourway . We reverse thefeed , and we bring Edward into your mind . Can you imagine his shock when hefinds ... that he 's been thrust into this whole otherworld ? - l do it all the time . - You 're a willing participant . You 're aware of what 's happening . Edward 's in a coma . And besides , we don 't know what effect itwill have on you . I mean , you 're already exhausted . - Have you been sleeping ? - Yes . - Any more nightmares ? - No . - No . - Good . Leave work here . Don 'ttake it home in this . Hey , you . What are you lookingfor , hmm ? Want some milk ? That 'sfun . Let me try it . Not so much power . The animal is delicate . Edward , is thatyou ? Edward , were there seagulls being killed on the beach ... while you were sailing ? Don 't hide , sweetie , please ? Edward , is thatyou ? Don 't be afraid . No one will hurtyou . Edward , is thatyou ? Go to sleep . Help ! Somebody , help me , please ! Somebody ! Help me ! Can you hear me ? Help ! Thanksforwaiting , Cole . Teddy Lee , no problem . Special Agent Ramsey . - Cole . - Morning . Whofound her ? The surveyorforthe railroad , about 6 : 00 this morning . Skidmarks appearto match the tire tracksfrom Reno . And it looks like he scraped the rail and lost some paint . It 's on its way to the lab already . Dumped the body overthere . Bleach . Anne Marie Vicksey . She makes seven . Jeez , this stinks . Do they all look like dolls ? Every unfortunate soul . What 's that ? Some kind of a collar . Part of his methodology . The way he puts itthere ? He makes itforthem . It makes himfeel they belong to him . is the water always this low ? Yeah , this time of year . Give me a coroner 's report right away . Preliminaryforensics , too . I don 'twant anyone dragging their ass on this . So , how was work ? Oh , exhausting . I have no idea , Jean . For God 's sake . Good luckwith the monster . I love you , too. I gotta go . - OK . Thanks . Bye . - All right . Bye-bye . Hot off the presses . There 's nothing new to report , gentlemen . A match on his semen . Water in her lungs ... show high levels of chlorine and rust . What , pray tell , is this ? They say theyfound some dog hair ? From a canine unit ? No . There was no canine unit . And Anne Vicksey doesn 't own a dog , Teddy . I wantto see this . Whatyou got , Teddy ? Hypomelanosis . And that means ? A complete absence of melanin . The dog is an albino . He 'd love an animal like that . Gentlemen ... I believe an albino dog is a rare animal indeed . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . You poor boy . You 're gonna be OK . Baby , I 'm so sorry . Jesus Christ , Peter . Thoughtyou were gonna get some sleep , clean yourself up . I did . - They 're waiting , you know . - l 'm ready . Let 's go . We 're gonna do this two ways . Breeders of German shepherds . Ford dealers . I wantyou to be thorough , and I also wantyou to befast . This guy 's accelerating . He only waited six days this time . When hefirst started , months could pass . And that means one of two differentthings . One , he thinks we 're stupid , and we can 't catch him . Two , which is the one that I believe ... he wants to be caught . The dog hairthing is sloppy . He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey in three inches of water . He knew thatwe 'dfind her . Now , there 's one thing I knowfor certain . If we can 't stop him ... he ain 't gonna stop himself . Will this be all right ? Yes , ma 'am , that 's great . Thankyou very much . She was still living at home , ma 'am ? We were looking through apartments . Butthey 're not moving in together ... until afterthe wedding . Julia wants to be married . Did she ever mention anything out of the ordinary ? For instance , somebody she was seeing mad ... or somebody perhaps watching her orfollowing her ? Pardon me . Ramsey . What if you made a mistake ? Maybe this isn 'tthe man . Maybe Julia 's safe . There 's certain things that he does ... that make us pretty positive thatthis is the man . Lastyear , I lost my husband to cancer . I wentthrough such terrible pain . ButJulia , she was always therefor me . What 's going on , Gordon ? Riverside sherifffound a dog breeder in Woodcrest . Three years ago , she had a buyer ... for an albino shepherd pup . Sheriff checks D.M.V. Son of a bitch drives a ' 92ford pickup . - Guess what color . - Aquamarine . Ramsey ! - Novak ! - Where is it ? Edison , just east of Loma Park . S.W.A.T. ' s had the house under surveillance ... for abouttwenty minutes . Carl Rudolph Stargher . No registered weapons , no priors . Got a licensefor his dog , though . Named him Valentine . You 're the bad man , aren 'tyou , Carl ? Mairzy doats and dozy doats And liddle lamzy divey A kiddley divey , too Wouldn 'tyou ? Brock , Agent Ramsey , Agent Novak . We got here asfast as we could . I briefed them on the way over . Where do we stand ? Here 's the situation . We got a high-ground team on the roof ... afour-man elementto the east . We got an entry team in the van acrossfrom the house ... a two man elementto the south . Have you seen him yet ? No . There 's been some movement in the kitchen . Can 'ttell what it is . - You thinkthe girl 's in there ? - We 'll assume she is . - fbi ! - Go ! Freeze , motherfucker ! I gotthe dog ! - Clear . - Clear . They 'll take him to County General . Reid 's already there . Make sure he stays cuffed . I wanttwo men on him at all times . I don 'twant anyone to treat him but Reid . Not so much as a thermometer up his ass , understand ? She 's not here . You should come downstairs . Mommy ! Please take care of my little baby ! Please , are you there ? Hello ? Please hear me . Can you hear me ? I need something . I need you ... Anybody here ? This is not happening to me . This is definitely not happening . Please help ! Have you ever heard of Whelan 's infraction ? It 's aform of schizophrenia . It 's very rare , and it 's very severe . In any schizophrenic ... these areas would be affected ... but in someone with Whelan 's ... they 're hit hard , and they 're hitfast . Can 'tyou load him up with thorazine or doxepin ? Normal psychotropics don 'twork . This thing is caused by a virus ... that infects the neurological system in utero . It lays dormant ... until it 's triggered by some kind of trauma . Most likely , he 's exhibited symptomsfor some time ... butthe infraction , orthe breach ... didn 't occur until today . The triggers can vary . Uh , usually water-related , butthe results don 'tvary . He 's notjust catatonic . He 's disappeared- - like having a dream and neverwaking up . For how long ? Oh , forever . Lee , I thinkwe might be missing the bigger picture here . Now , whatever state that he happens to be in ... there is a girl that is missing ... and her name is Julia Hickson ... and he is the only one that knows where she is . He keeps them in this thing ... for aboutforty hours . Now , he tookJulia Hickson at 7 : 30 last night . Peter , you know me . If there were anything , anything ... What ? He provides them withfood ... drinking water , and a toilet . Now , she thinks she 's been kidnapped ... thatthere 's a chance of survival ... but it 's just aform of torture . This is a kind of ritual for him- - a cleansing before he takes them home ... and turns them into a doll , a toy . Now , this thing isfully automated ... and unless wefind her by tonight ... this will happen to her . Atthe request of Mr. Cooperman ... we 've contacted your board of directors ... and they 've given their approval . And so have Edward 's parents . Butthe decision is yours . It 's upto Catherine . She 's the one who would have toface ... whatever risks there might be ... so , I support whatever decision she makes . Can I askyou something ? Please . If he wasn 't like this ... if he was conscious ... do you thinkthat he would tell you where she is ? There 's always a chance of a confession . Yeah . And there 's things he 's done that show a needfor disclosure . He hasn 't had a sympathetic ear . He wants someone to listen , to try and understand him . Look , lfeelforthis girl , I do ... but Stargher may no longer know the truth . For severe schizophrenics ... there 's no discerning betweenfantasy and reality . is it possible ? If he came to trust me , yes ... but ittakes months to earn that kind of trust . is it possible ? Daddy ? Come here ... and save me ! Save me ! I 'm daddy 's girl . His levels are tooflat . What happened here ? We removedfourteen steel rings . Should have left him the way he was . He used to suspend himself , didn 't he ? They 're comforted by thefeeling of weightlessness ... likefloating in water . Now , this , gentlemen , is the catalyst . The neurological connectic transfer system ... not only maps the mind ... it sends the signal to another party . All you need to do is tune in ... butyou do much more than tune in . You become part of the show . He 's ready . Why are there three stations ? For a while , we tried jointtherapy sessions- - two shrinks forthe price of one- - but Edward hated it and only talked to Catherine . She has a gift . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . OK . Response signal ... functioning . We implanted a touch-sensitive microchip in her hand ... so if she wants to stopthe session ... or if it gets too intense , she can give the signal ... and we abort . When we were ready for practical testing ... Miriam and I auditioned ... some of the best child therapists in the country . And all they did was observe and report , nothing more . Catherine was the least experienced ... but she came so highly recommended ... thatwe decided , whatthe hell , we 'll give her a shot ... and immediately , we could tell she was different . You 're not human . You don 't lie in my house . You 're an animal ! Hey , you . Yeah , you like that , don 'tyou ? is your name Carl ? You know , I know another little boy with a horse . His name 's Edward . I mean the boy , notthe horse . What 's wrong ? His victims . Where you comefrom ? Gentlemen , she 's back . I 'll be rightthere . All right . Come on , Catherine . She 's had quite a journey . Unlike anything we 've ever seen before . - So she 's made contact ? - Oh , yes . She 's gone very deep into his world . Attimes toofar . It 's cold . That can be dangerous . What are you talking about ? Well , if she came to believe that Stargher 's world is real ... then theoretically , her mind could convince her body ... that anything thatwas done to itthere ... is actually done . It 's like the old wives ' tale where you die in your dream ... you die in real life . Henry , could you raise the temperature in here , please ? - Dr . Kent ? - Just a moment , please . Dr. Kent , can I come in there and speakwith you ? We have to be patient . I mean , look at her . She 's drowsy . Let herwake up . We don 't have a lot of time . Do you understand that ? Ourfather , who art in heaven ... hallowed be thy name . Am I interrupting anything ? is it OK if I ... He knows you 're here , doesn 't he ? Myfriend Dr. Reid said ... that it 's very unusual- - schizophrenia , that is- - in a child that 's this young . They usually think it 's autism . Whatyou have to understand ... is there 's nothing wrong with his body . What 's paralyzed is a part of his mind . It 's so damaged by the virus ... he can 't even will himself to move . You thinkyou can change that ? Do you believe there 's a part of yourself ... thatyou don 't show anybody ? I think everybody has that side of themselves . During a session , when I 'm inside ... I getto see those things . Ifeel them . With Stargher , lfeltthings I neverwanttofeel again . He 's not even Carl Stargher anymore . He 's this idealized version of himself- - a king in a very , very twisted kingdom . The placefor him to indulge every ... You know , I don 'twantto talk aboutthis in here . I could never do whatyou do- - devote myself to understanding a mind like that . I don 'tthinkwe 'll ever be able to understand a mind like that . Butyou try . That 's yourjob . I guess so . You don 't like whatyou do ? I like it better than my old job . Used to be an attorney . I was a prosecutor . What happened ? I had a case , um ... where this little girl was molested . And because of this one tiny piece of evidence ... thatwas tainted , he walked . Uh , Charles Gish walked away . Nothing I could do about it . The night after he was released ... Margaret 's parents came home- - thatwas the little girl 's name- - Margaret Sims . And theyfound Charles Gish sitting in their living room . He was watching television ... and Margaret was sitting nextto him ... and he had cut her open right down the middle . The parentsfound Margaret 's heart in thefreezer . Charlesfigured they 'd probably wantto keep it . Afterthat , I leftthe D.A ... and joined the fbi . Figured I 'd justtry to catch ' em . Till now . You know , I started to tell you ... that Stargher really isn 't Stargher anymore . Well , that 's true , and it 's not . The dominant side is still this horrible thing ... butthere 's a positive side that- - Positive side ? Well , the way he sees himself as a child . But isn 'tthat him ? The boy Stargher made contact . He 's curious about me . If I could reach the boy ... then maybe he 'd tell me aboutJulia . Whatever happened to Charles Gish ? Old Charlie beatthe murder rap ... because he was insane when he killed Margaret . His attorney milked the jury for all they were worth . Said that a life of sexual abuse drove him to do these things ... and , you know , whateverthefuck . All that same old bullshit . Why is that bullshit ? I believe a child can experience ... a hundred times worse the abuse than what Gish wentthrough ... and still grow upto be ... somebody thatwould never , ever , ever hurt another living being . And you 're sure of that ? Yes , I am . I 'm sure of that . Hey , where the hell you been ? I 've been right here . Well , nexttime tell me , OK ? I didn 'twantto disturbyou . You looked so cute , you know ? You 're all sleeping when you get that look on you . Your colleagues wantto know whatto do with Stargher . Tell them to prep him . I 'll be rightthere . Thankyou , Catherine . Stargher have any pets ? You know , cats , dogs ... Yeah , you 're a good boy , aren 'tyou , Valentine ? That 's supposed to help ? On a subconscious level , yes . Anything thatwas special to Stargher , gave him pleasure ... should make him more accessible ... more peaceful . Peaceful ? Nice little pup . - Mr . Novak . - Doctor . Thankyou . Round two . Hey , notfunny . Come on , stop playing around . I 'm not. lt 's a power problem . We 're locked out , Catherine . l--l need you to check the circuit breaker . I wantyou to check circuits six through twelve . Come on . Get up . Six through twelve . I 'm already in . What did she say ? Come here , boy . Can you take me to Carl ? Need some help ? I 've got a presentforyou . If you need me ... or if youfeel like I 'm around butyou can 'tfind me ... just ... Shine it like this . Go ahead , take it . You like it ? - Carl ? - What 's the matter ? What ? What 's wrong ? What happened over here ? Just broke all by itself . - Did you breakthat plate ? - l broke the plate . - Did you breakthat plate ? - l broke the plate . Well , hey , let 's ... Let 's break ' em all , how aboutthat ? You littlefucking liar ! I should 've drowned you like the runt of the litter . You don 't lie in my house . This is my house ! - He 's just a boy . - Shut up ! You 're not his mother ! She 's notyour mother . She left us , Carl . Rememberthat . See that ? Wait . Jesus Christ ! Whatthefuck is this ? Get back--Get over here ! Playing with dolls ? You littlefaggot ! God ! What are you , some kind of a woman ? - Get up ! - But , dad- - Damn it . You want something to cry about ? I 'll give you something to cry about , woman ! Mama 's boy ! I didn 't raise nofaggot ! Stopyour crying . You wantto iron like a woman ? - Let me show you how to iron . - No ! Help me . See ? She was myfirst . I made such a mess . Now what I have to do ... Why are you here ? Don 't lie . - l came to helpyou . - You 're lying . Bitch . Whore . Cunt ! You sound like yourfather . He was nothing . He is nothing . Who told you to say that ? Do you rememberthefirsttime he talked to you ? Were you in water ? Maybe you went swimming . Itwas my baptism . Myfather , he ... he pushed me under . I think I had some kind of seizure . I think I was drowning ... and everybody just looked at me . Nobody helped me . Nobody . Except him . Myfather ... he took me home that night ... and he broke three of my ribs ... andfractured my jaw . I was six years old . Whatyourfather did to you is evil . What he did to you was wrong . He treated you like a thing . He was more ... powerful than me . No . No one should be treated like that . is that right ? In whatworld do you live in ? Carl , where is Julia Hickson ? No names . Where is she ? I know you , Carl . You wantto tell me . Oh , you know me ? Oh , you know who I am ? Where is she ? Where 's Julia ? That can 't be right . Danger pulse . - No change . - Christ . What about emergency cessation ? Gradually terminate thefeed , disable the receptors- - lt could lead to massive shock ... and , Henry , could you please shutthatthing off ? What 's going on ? That hypothetical situation I told you about ? - lt 's happening . - Can 'tyou stop it ? It 's notthat simple . Well , you stopped it before- - Yes , thatwas different . Thatwas Edward . With Stargher , his mind is unfamiliarterritory ... and she 's lost . She thinks this is real . Well , is there anything thatwe can do ? Whateverwe do runs the risk of making things worsefor her . Worse . That 's great . So she 's lost somewhere ? - No . No . - No , what ? I need you here . Fucking stop ! Stop ! Let me thefuck out ! Let me out ! Get me out , you sickfuck ! Fuckyou ! Let me out . Do something . Do something to end this . I got bugs crawling all over my body . It gets worse . You 're completely unprepared forthis . Ah , Dr. Kent , we 've been over all this . Yes , but I 've been through the process . She wentthrough the process , too , and it didn 't matter . You don 't know him . Be lucky . Come on , guys . Ready ? Peter , thefirstfew minutes ... will be very disorienting . Rememberto stay calm andfocused . instincts play a very important part here , so trustthem . All right . Peter , you 've read herfile . Hit herwith something personal . And remember , Peter ... it 's not real . Have you seen him ? My boy ? My little one ? Hisfathertook himfrom me . I spit it out my hole . Big deal. don 't mean anything . My child 's an abomination . He has no soul . is thatyou ? You all right ? Hold me . This isn 't real . Did daddy do a bad thing ? Don 't be scared . This isn 't real . Naughty worm . I 'll kill you ! Fuckyou , motherfucker ! Catherine , wake thefuck up , now ! Mairzy doats and dozy doats And liddle lamzy divey A kiddley divey , too Wouldn 'tyou ?

Can you get me out of thisfucking suit ? Yeah , Cole here . - Cole , it 's Novak . - Yeah , what 's up ?

Call me when you get down there . - You OK , Pete ? - l 'mfine . You wantto tell me what happened in there ? You in pain ? - What happened , Peter ? - l saw her . - Who did you see ? - l know where tofind her . - Who ? - Julia. I saw her . OK . Why don 'tyou come and let Dr. Kent have a look atyou ? - Cole ? - Yeah , this is Cole . Now , what am I doing down here ? That machine that he uses- - there 's a hoist . I wantyou to look for a plaque ... or a metal plate with some sort of logo on it . Yeah , I got it . It 's Carver industrial equipment ... in Bakersfield , California .

I 'm gonna helpyou . Stop . Do notjeopardize your career . Stop ! It 's dangerous . What are you doing ? - Miriam . - What 's she doing ? - You know what she 's doing . - For Christ 's sake . Jesus ! - She changed the codes . - You can 't get in withoutthem ? - She reversed thefeeds . - What does that mean ? The process is intended for herto go into his mind . But instead , she 's bringing him into hers . Stop ! No more ! I promised I 'd come back and helpyou . See ? I always keep my promises . Can I stay here ... with you ? Oh ... no , honey , I 'm sorry . It doesn 'tworkthatway . There 's nothing I can do aboutthat . Yes , there is . When I was a little boy ... lfound this bird . He was injured and ... had a broken leg or something . Well , myfather found outthat I had it . And I knew that he would do something horrible to it . Itwas just a matter of time . So I took itto the sink , and l--l held it under . Itwas betterforthe bird . I saved him . I can 't do that , Carl . I won 't . It doesn 't matter . ltfound me . It alwaysfinds me . Agent Novak ? Go ahead . - Cole ? - Novak , listen to this . The hoistwas sold to a guy named Bainbridge ... who tried to build a machine works out near Delano . Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court ... and the state winds up with the land . And guess who they hire to seal the place up . Aw , you 'refuckin ' kiddin ' me . No. I 'm notthe kidding type . Carl Rudolph Stargher . - Where 's the land ? - Exit 10 , off highway 99 . - We 're on ourway now . - Got it. I know where that is . Help ! Help me ! This is the area . My world ... my rules . Help !

What is she doing here ? Said he wanted to see his home . It 's pretty strange . She 's keeping his dog , Peter . I 'd say pretty fucking strange is par for the course . I almost didn 't recognize you . How long do you get to be a civilian ? A couple weeks ... till after the inquiry and see what happens . Ramsey told me you were thinking of ... What do you call that thing ? - Reversal ? - Reversal . With that kid you were working with ? - Yeah . Edward . - Edward . Are you sure you want to do that ? Absolutely . You 're not worried about what might happen ? I would never do anything to hurt Edward . It wasn 't him I was worried about . What about you ? How are you ? I 'm not sure. I ... I remember pieces of everything . According to the fbi ... you guys put me on some drug-fueled mind-bender first ... then triggered a memory I already had ... and officially we found Julia Hickson ... through good old-fashioned detective work . I guess this is hello and good-bye , then . I guess so . Catherine . - Be safe .

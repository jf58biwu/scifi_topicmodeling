 Hi . How are you ? Thirsty . Straight up . And no ice this time . I tell this guy about the ice , and then he pours me a Scotch rocks . About the ice ? The water , actually , in the ice . I 'm kind of an expert on it . - What 's wrong with it ? - No big secret . It 's been in the news . Government additive . Something they call chloramine . They said it 's good for us . It 's like fluoride or something . Well , that 's what they say . I didn 't sit down here to scare you . On the contrary . Would you like to get some air ? Long way to go for a drink . You like living out here ? How much farther ? Just over the bridge . What the hell are you doing ? Let go ! You 're going to kill us ! It 's okay , William. lt 's all right . It 's okay . It 's going to be okay . - Hello ? - Monica , it 's me . Did I wake you ? Brad , no , I 'm awake . - You 're in town ? - I came in on short notice . If you 're coming to the Hoover Building can you stop by my office on your way in ? - Yeah , sure. I can do that . - Good . Looking forward to it . federal police are investigating the bizarre death of a government employee last night . The body of 38-year-oId carl Wormus , a deputy administrator for the environmental Protection Agency , was pulled from the Potomac by rescue divers . It appears Wormus drove through a barricade and off a drawbridge into the river . A police spokesperson said it appears he was alone in the car- - - Monica ? - Hi . - What are you doing ? - l was leaving you a note . Your assistant was out and I didn 't want to knock . I was going to call you . - Hi , Brad . - Come on in . What ? We 're at work . You used to ask me to close the door at work back in New York . is that all you called me here for , Assistant Director ? I probably shouldn 't tell you how hot you look , either . ' Cause you do . How long has it been ? Two years ? Yeah . We should catch up , Brad . I 've got to get downstairs . I 've got something for you . Forgive me , but it didn 't take much digging to find out why you 're here in D.C. , Monica . What are those ? Something you 're going to see , but I wanted to show you first . They were taken from the security cameras in the fbi parking garage . One of them shows you arrive in a cab , meeting John Doggett . I 'm working with him . - He called me up here on a case . - l heard . Believe me . This whole thing about a chase , and a crash and a fire . Now , Doggett 's internal investigation of Deputy Director Kersh. lt 's big news . What 's so important to show me ? What 's on the other tape ? How is your investigation going , John ? Have you turned up any incriminating evidence on me yet ? It 's only Monday morning , sir . It 's nothing personal , Deputy Director . I hope you know that . No , John. I think we 've pretty much always seen eye to eye . I 'm sure if you can 't find anything on me , John nobody can . Hi , how are you ? That good ? I didn 't ask to be put down in the X-Files . Kersh put me here . I 'm just doing my job . What did he think , that I 'd be thankful ? I 'd do anything less ? It 's not going to be easy . No , it isn 't . I 'm going after a deputy director . One man removed from the head of the fbi . No. I mean , it may be impossible . What 's this ? A security tape , two nights ago from the fbi garage . You 're not on it . What are you talking about ? No . This is the wrong damn tape . I 've been backwards and forwards on it . Nothing 's there . We were chased . Skinner and I were attacked and chased . Knowle Rohrer drove his car into the garage wall . - lt blew up in a ball of flames . - Not on this tape . Where did you get this ? From someone who wanted to give me a heads up . They can 't make this all go away . There 's evidence in that parking garage . - There were victims . - l went down to that garage , John . Whatever happened , they 've had 48 hours now to clean it up . - There were witnesses . - Witnesses who will stand up to this tape ? Mulder ? Mulder , are you here ? naval telecommunications Command . I need to make a shore-to-ship call to the S.S. valor Victor . Sir ? Sir ? - What ? What 's the matter ? - l 've been trying to call you . The phone 's off the hook because of the baby . I got panicked that you wouldn 't be here , that you left , too . Come in . I 've been looking for Mulder . - l went to his apartment . - l know . Where did he go ? Dana ? Where did he go ? He 's gone . He 's just gone . I don 't know where Mulder is . I don 't know that I 'd tell you if I did . I checked with movers , airlines , car rental agencies . No Mulder . Did somebody get to him , is that it ? It doesn 't seem possible , does it ? Okay , so where does that leave us ? It 's just me and you . Our word against Kersh and the fbi . You 'd better sit down , John . It 's more complicated than that . What 's more complicated ? This investigation . What about it ? I want to ask you to drop it . No , not from you . Not after what we 've been through . - We barely escaped with our lives . - That 's something worth thinking about . I 'm sorry . You 're not that reasonable . What , did they get to you , too ? No one got to me , John . They didn 't have to . That 's the point . You 're afraid of them . I 'm not afraid of them . Well , you 're afraid of something . What ? The real tape showing up ? Them calling you a killer for you having to shoot Alex Krycek ? No. I 'll stand by my actions , Agent Doggett but I won 't stand by yours if you continue to push until you get someone killed . You want to know what I fear ? I fear for Mulder and Scully . I fear for the life of that child if you don 't stop pushing , John . - You don 't think I fear for those things ? - lf you did , you would let it go . So , what I 'm hearing is if I don 't drop it I 'm alone on this . John . You 're not . Hi . I hope it wasn 't presumptuous of me . I ordered you a martini . No . The presumption is all mine . I called and asked you out , didn 't I ? You actually had me confused a little this morning in my office . I had this crazy notion that you were avoiding me . Maybe I was trying to avoid myself . And those tapes you pulled from your desk weren 't exactly Pamela and Tommy Lee . I 'd heard that you and John Doggett were tight . You make it sound like I go home from work with Post-lts on my ass . - lt 's nothing like that . - Then I don 't get it . Why risk your name and your career getting caught up in this rabid investigation of his ? There isn 't going to be an investigation . Not anymore . I wouldn 't have thought Agent Doggett would be thrown off so easy . Not what I heard about him . Whatever you may think about him , Brad , he 's not a fool , you know ? - Now you 're pissed off at me . - No. I 'm pissed off because this means I 'll be shipping back to the New Orleans Field Office . What are you talking about ? The way I heard it , you 're with the X-Files . If this investigation drops , they will drop the X-Files along with it . You know where my interests lie . This was my dream assignment . Not to mention how excited I was to be up here in D.C. But you just got here . Yeah , I know . I 'm really sorry . - Dana , I need your help . - l don 't know how to find him . It just doesn 't make any sense . Mulder leaving you here all alone . Just walking out on you . Not telling you where and why ? It makes sense in its own way . That 's all I can tell you . Then tell me why you can 't trust me . After all I did to protect you when you thought your baby was in danger . What changed ? Why am I suddenly the enemy ? Let it go , John . Drop it . Please . These people tried to kill me and A.D. Skinner . They would have killed Mulder . They 're still out there . Exactly right . They are unstoppable , and they are inside the fbi . You know something you 're not telling me . Mulder knows something . How long can you hide from it ? Knowle Rohrer , this military buddy of mine said your pregnancy was a result of a cloning experiment to try to create a super soldier . I don 't want to hear this . Look , there is nothing to any of this . Knowle Rohrer was one of the men that tried to kill us in the fbi garage . My baby , my son is fine . I hope to God that 's true . I just don 't want to pretend . I 'm going to ask you to leave . I 'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here . - Directory assistance . May I help you ? - Let 's try Maryland or Virginia . What listing , please ? Number for a Ryan Bracker . B-R-A-C-K-E-R . I obtained this number for Roger Erickson , formerly of the US Marine Corps . Speaking . Roger ? Hey . It 's John Doggett , Bravo Company . - Hey , man . How are you doing ? - l 'm good. lt 's good to hear you . - Do you remember Knowle Rohrer ? - Sure , I remember him . What 's the story with him ? Didn 't he get involved in something when we got back ? Special Ops ? I have no idea , I never heard from KnowIe after we got back . - We should get together , catch up . - Yeah let 's catch a beer sometime . This is Shannon , leave a message and I 'II return it as soon as I can . This is John Doggett . I 'm trying to reach a Shannon McMahon who was with Bravo Company , USMC . If this is she , please contact me through the fbi in Washington D.C as soon as possible . Sleepy time , sweet William . I 'll see you in a couple hours . Hello ? Monica Reyes . It 's Scully . Dana , what 's wrong ? Are you all right ? - Is Agent Doggett there ? - Yeah , he 's right here with me . Dana ? - Is something wrong ? - Yeah , something . I think I might have been wrong telling you to drop your investigation . Well , I didn 't drop it . As a matter of fact we found something . I 'm not sure how it fits yet . - What is it ? - A body . Thanks for coming . The deceased 's name is Carl Wormus . Deputy Administrator for the EPA . He drove through a barricade and off a bridge two nights ago . And ? Someone at the fbi thought it was important enough to stick his obituary under our noses . - Who ? - We don 't know . His blood alcohol level was upwards of .15 . He was drunk . He crashed and drowned . There 's got to be something more . - John Doggett . - What the hell are you doing ? Excuse me ? Do you know how many people are waiting to see you screw up ? - To see you make a mistake like this ? - l didn 't know I made a mistake . The EPA guy you checked out at Maryland County Morgue without jurisdiction . - Come on . - AII your friends , John . - Your former buddies at the fbi . - What are you talking about ? They 're not your pals anymore . Not since you 've launched an attack on one of your own . Just watch your back , John . Definitive answer how this guy died . What will that take ? A careful autopsy . - How fast can you do it ? - That 's not what I 'm saying . I 'd understand if you don 't want to do this . But you 're the only person we can trust . Collecting for the needy and unemployed . Open the door . Thanks for doing this , guys . Like we 've got anything better to be doing these days . Just to let you know , we may need to hit you up for some coin . Why , what happened to you guys ? Don 't ask . We hacked into the Department of the lnterior 's mainframe and got the EPA files you wanted on this man , Carl Wormus . And ? What are we , mind readers ? That 's all you asked us to do . What exactly was it you were looking for , if we may ask ? I was hoping you would find something . If he had any secrets , he took them to his grave . Nothing hinky in his files except some kind of rabid obsession with water . With water ? Water . Asphyxiation induced by the inhalation of water . Contusions on the forehead and on the chest but the impact isn 't what killed him . This man drowned . You 're looking at me like you hope that there 's more , but there isn 't . I 'm sorry . That 's not it . I 'm just impressed that you can do this . This is what I do , Agent Reyes . But you 're here doing it now . Something did happen , didn 't it ? I know what you 're afraid of . That there 's something wrong with your baby . We can let our fears get the better of us . We can imagine things , make connections with things that aren 't there . Like with this man . If you ever feel the need to talk to someone , Dana , I 'm here . I 'd never betray a confidence . There is something . - What ? - Right here , on the ankle . Are those fingerprints ? Yeah , that 's what they look like . From someone holding him down ? I don 't know how , or who . I don 't know if you 're aware of where Agent ScuIIy is . She 's at Quantico , called in by John Doggett to autopsy a body he 's got no authority to touch . If I may be blunt , sir . Doggett 's put his tit in the ringer . Maybe . So what ? A lot of us think that he 's lost all judgment . And one man 's actions should not affect the entire fbi . We feel he should be called out for this . Punished ? Yes , sir . Thank you , Assistant Director . It 's a difficult situation to be in . I appreciate you doing this . It was the right thing to do . Let me know how it goes . No. I can 't , sir . There 's a conflict . - l can 't do this myself . - l can 't very well do it . How would it look ? I 'm under investigation by Agent Doggett . You have no personal axe to grind . Hello , can I help you ? Hi , I 'm looking for Dana Scully . I 'm sorry . She 's not here . Can I tell her who 's calling ? We work together . Do you know where l can find her ? No . Would you like to leave a message ? I 'll leave her a note if you wouldn 't mind opening the door . Why don 't you just leave your name and I 'll have Dana call you ? You need to get this body into refrigeration to preserve him as evidence . Whatever he 's evidence of . Whatever it is , I can 't reach John to even tell him about it . Monica , I don 't know what to say . But good luck . I got to go. I got to get home . Third floor , they have a cooler for the teaching cadavers . You can temporarily put him up there . Behind us . Just keep walking . Who is she ? I 've never seen her before this morning . Now , I 've seen her twice . Excuse us . - Where 's Agent Doggett ? - What are you doing , Brad ? What am I doing ? I 'm doing my best to cover your ass . - What are you talking about ? - This . - l 'm taking about these . - Let go of me . What 's going on ? Okay . Where did he go ? Who ? Where did who go ? Where did Doggett take the body ? You 're not making any sense , Brad . Agent Doggett didn 't take any body anywhere . You don 't believe me . Ask Agent Scully . I 'm going to go now . I 've got a child at home . Body or no body you were here doing an autopsy . Doggett was here without authorization . Without authorization ? He 's out of control , Monica . Forget the X-Files . He 'll take you down with him . This was you , wasn 't it ? You floated that obituary to me , to set Agent Doggett up using me ? What obituary ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You came to me for help , remember ? - l 'm only trying to help you help yourself . - l know exactly what you 're doing , Brad . Don 't forget to piss on all the corners before you leave . I didn 't float any obituary . What is she talking about ? Son of a ... . Yeah ? Hello . Considering the recent violence attempted on Agent Doggett you might want to know who 's at the door before you open it . Next time I 'll get a chair . Agent Doggett 's gone . What do you mean , " gone " ? He and Assistant Director Skinner split for Maryland . Show her what we found , before she makes any nasty remarks . It took some real hacking but Carl Wormus , from the Environmental Protection Agency ... . He 'd been receiving encrypted e-mails from a water reclamation plant in Maryland from a worker there , named Roland McFarland . - Encrypted data on what ? - Don 't know . Whatever it is , it may have gotten both of these men killed . There are no name plates . I see that . This is madness . Even if he connects to the investigation , we don 't know we 're in the right area . This has got to be McFarland 's area . This may be his desk . - Let 's get the computer hard drive and go . - We 're not sure if it 's his . Somebody will walk through these doors any minute and it won 't matter . Just keep an eye out . What 's chloramine ? What ? Why are you asking me about chloramine ? Because this is McFarland 's desk . He 's got tons of files on chloramine in it . - l 'm betting it figures into all this . - Agent Doggett ! Grab the files and go . Assistant Director ! Looks like you and I are chasing the same man . Agent Doggett ? I have an urgent communication to deliver to Dr. Nordlinger . I can deliver the communication . I was asked to confirm he received the communiqué- - That 's not proper procedure . Report back Dr. Nordlinger 's acknowledgement of the communiqué . What 's going on ? There 's confusion as to the proper procedure , Dr. Nordlinger . I have a communication for you . Communication acknowledged and confirmed , Captain . We 're returning to base . - Officer Banford . - Captain . Prepare to transmit to Operations Commander . Transmit what , sir ? - Sir ? What is the communication ? - We 're coming in . I 'm sorry I 'm late . Have a seat , Agent Reyes . Agent Reyes I thought we might have a little chat . Mr. Skinner here has been trying to help me put together the pieces of your X-Files investigation . - Can we cut the crap , Brad ? - l don 't know . Can we ? - There 's a lot of crap to cut through . - Agent Reyes you probably want to zip it and try to cooperate . Like it or not , I 'm now charged with the task of reining you in . Reining us in ? - For what ? - Unauthorized autopsies breaking and entering into a state water facility willful misuse of your positions . I don 't want to go into any of this without my partner here . Your partner . Your so-called partner , who 's running this circus is right now nowhere to be found . What are you doing , Brad ? Giving you and Mr. Skinner the opportunity to put a nice spin on this mess that Doggett 's making . Agent Reyes , if you 're not going to zip it at least recognize that he 's the only one who can help you . We were given a tip we believe leads to a larger conspiracy . A conspiracy ? involving the fbi ? John Doggett and I are running a legitimate investigation into the fbi . - Neither one of us feels- - - Agent Reyes I 'm trying to help you keep your job . But that won 't happen if you insist on chasing shadows , chasing conspiracies . How do you know there isn 't one ? You 're taking on the entire fbi , Monica . This witch hunt isn 't going to expose anything but you . That is , unless you distance yourself from John Doggett . What are you doing ? I 'm distancing myself , Brad . From you . From your political games . You just want to get John Doggett . You 're making a big mistake here . Yeah. I seem to make one every time I walk in your door . Lie back , John. lt 's okay . What the hell is this ? It 's Shannon . Shannon McMahon . We were together in Bravo Company , USMC . You were trying to contact me . What the hell are you doing here now ? Your lungs were full of water . You pulled me under . I did what I had to . - You held me down. I remember . - They would have caught you . They might have figured it out . What you started to figure out . What are you ? You know what I am . I 'm the product of 50 years of military science . The program your old friend Knowle Rohrer told you about . I 'm a bio-engineered combat unit . I have no weaknesses. I don 't sleep I can breathe underwater . That 's how I saved your life , John . How do you know what I know , what Knowle Rohrer told me ? Knowle Rohrer and I were drafted right out of Bravo Company together . We were Adam and Eve . Program 's first . There are many more now . Knowle Rohrer is dead . You can 't kill us . We can 't be killed . Knowle Rohrer and I are alike in almost every way . The difference is , I hate what I am . Why are you here telling me this ? The program 's expanding in ways no one ever dreamed of . I need your help to stop it , John . You need my help ? What can I do ? Expose the deaths of those two men I killed . - What they were doing ... . - What were they doing ? Preparing the water supply . Preparing it for what ? What are you doing , Captain ? Where are you going ? We 're under strict orders not to leave ship . Look at us . They 've got us tied up at a civilian dock in Baltimore . Why ? - l think they may be on to us . - We 're drawing suspicion if they 're not . - You can 't leave this ship . - We can 't risk waiting . We can 't risk not making contact now . I 'll be back . Hi. I 'm sorry about the hour . I just put him down . I couldn 't talk on the phone . Well , what is it ? I was told to leave this alone . You and Mulder asked me to leave it be . To let Mulder disappear . We were concerned for the safety of the baby and for Mulder . Why am I risking that now ? Why are you ? Why are you getting mixed up with Doggett 's investigation ? Something happened with my baby . What ? I can 't explain it . It 's ... . lt 's unexplainable . It 's ... . - lt 's not normal . - Whatever it is I think you 've made a terrible mistake . Letting Doggett pull you into this . I mean , he 's hell-bent . And Agent Reyes is following right in his tracks . I need answers . I need to know . I can 't just sit around wondering . If you can 't tell me , then get to Mulder . - Tell him what happened . - No . Mulder can 't know . He can 't be brought into this . He can 't be brought back to the fbi . It 's just too dangerous for him right now . It 's too dangerous for everyone . The EPA employee you 're trying to reach , carl Wormus is not available . If you want to leave a voicemail , stay on the line . 'Evening , Captain . Something is wrong . Very wrong . Sir ? What is this ? Where 's Banford ? Chief Petty Officer Banford has been relieved of his post , sir . I 'm your new second-in-command . Hello ? Dana ? I 'm sorry if I woke you . It 's Monica Reyes . Dana ... . There 's something I think you really need to be aware of . Something you need to hear . Something I 'm not sure I believe . I 'm listening . It 's not me you need to hear it from . Agent Scully ? We may have some answers for you . About your baby . Dana , this is Shannon McMahon . Hi . Let 's start with the water . Well , you 're a scientist . You 'll appreciate the science involved . A new additive is being put in the water supply . It 's called chloramine. lt 's not news . It 's been reported , but no one 's asking questions yet . And what should they be asking ? If you want to deliver something to everyone 's home what better way than through what 's taken for granted : water . I 've had my fair share of outrageous conspiracy theories . So cut the mystery crap and get to the science . Chloramine is just a substitute for chlorine . You can drink it and it 's harmless . Unless someone were to quietly go and change its molecular makeup . Who ? And how ? I think you 'd be more interested in why . All right , then . Why ? To prime a population to breed a generation of super soldiers . By adding something to our water ? Something which promotes the mutation of offspring , in fertilization or pregnancy . - What you 're saying is absurd . - ls it ? No more absurd than I am . I am a first-generation prototype . Now they 're seven stages advanced on the science which created me to the point where they have successfully given birth to a super soldier from a mutated egg . How can we trust any of this ? Or you ? What you say you are ? We all have a standard mutation . What are you looking at ? The ship 's logs . Those logs are classified . As second-in-command , I 'm supposed to know the ship , sir . In case something should happen to you . What is the greater mission of this ship , if I may ask sir ? I don 't ask . We don 't ask . What 's going on ? It doesn 't make any sense . Yeah , only it doesn 't hold up to any argument either , does it ? She drowned that man from the EPA . She 's drowned two men . They 're part of the program . Two guys trying to spike the water supply . So , she killed them as a way of contacting you ? You believe that ? You saw that thing on her neck . You said you saw it before . I think we 're onto something . I mean , it 's mind-blowing . You got to admit that . Come on . I 'm not doubting what she is . Only what she says she 's doing . - What did you find ? - Nothing . Nothing more than a small deformity of the spine . Physically , she seems absolutely normal . As normal as you or I . I don 't believe this . What don 't you believe , Agent Doggett ? I just examined her . That both of you are telling me you don 't see what 's right in front of us . She 's the key to everything in this case , right to the fbi . For your sake , I hope so . But I hope not , for mine . John Doggett . Agent Doggett , I don 't want to be making this call. I really don 't . - But I 'm forced to . - What are you talking about ? You want to turf me now ? - You going to take my badge and gun ? - You just can 't burst in here . How will it look , Deputy Director ? Suspending me right before I nail you against the wall as a co-conspirator ? Glad you dropped in , Mr. Doggett . Assistant Director Follmer . - You 're Brad Follmer . - l was explaining to the Deputy Director the reasons why you are being suspended , but I think your actions here speak for themselves . I see what this is . - This is a little bureaucratic pimp job . - l 'd watch your mouth , John . What this is , is a testament to your gross insubordination and reckless disregard for the fbi . The orders start here , and then they come out your wishy-washy mouth ? Paranoia must go with the job . You 're starting to sound just like Fox Mulder , Mr. Doggett . Don 't you " Mr. Doggett " me . I don 't answer to you . I answer to A.D. Skinner . The job suspension stands , Mr. Doggett . Try and stop me . You just never know who 's going to come a-knocking , do you ? - How did you get in ? - Through the front door . How about you ? Through a security checkpoint . Kid 's stuff . What are you doing here ? You sent us hacking on this investigation of yours only we had a small funding fiasco . They cut our Internet service . Don 't tell me you breached fbi security just to log on . I think you want to see this . Not this . Okay . This is what we meant to show you . We are live in the EPA phone system . The numbers in red are calls to Deputy Administrator Carl Wormus . After he drowned . Who 'd be calling him after it 's front-page news that he 's dead ? Someone who doesn 't know it . Whoever it is , they 're calling him again , as we speak . Hook up a patch cord . Hurry ! - Pick up the phone . - What ? Carl Wormus . I 've been trying to reach you . They 've ordered us to port . One of my men is dead . I think they suspect what we 're up to . Right . What is it you need from us , me , on this end ? Just like we talked about . You 're going to call the FBI . Right . You 've got to get to the fbi , tell them about the lab they got onboard . About the horrors and the inhumanity . Expose these people for what they are . - l need to talk to you . - l have an appointment . Don 't do this to me , Brad . Give me two minutes . Here you are again , Monica . Walking through my door . I need your help . I tried to help . I 'm asking you again . Okay. I 'm listening . There 's a woman at the Department of Justice : Shannon McMahon . I need her case files . You say that like it 's something I can just do , but it 's not . It 's important to me . Important to you and to Agent Doggett , in other words . You 're on the wrong side of this fight . I can show you . Trust me. I had it illustrated in the Deputy Director 's office today . Would you listen to me ? People 's lives are in danger here . He 's being set up . We 're being set up . By who ? The Justice Department ? It 's why I need those files . I 'd ask you to just do this for me but he 's a good man . He believes he 's in the right . And you ? You always are ? - Where 's Shannon McMahon ? - She 's back at my house . Why ? - What 's this about ? - She 's not who you think . - Where are you getting this ? - Everywhere I look . She works for the Department of Justice . Did you know that ? I got a peek at her case files . Those two men she killed they 'd contacted her at DOJ , as whistleblowers . She said they conspired with the government , as part of the program . They were killed because they wanted to expose the program . Why is she lying ? Why come to me ? There 's still one man she can 't pinpoint . She wants you to lead her to him . I don 't know who you 're talking about . He 's captain of a Navy ship that spends 12 months a year at sea . He talked with both dead men about a secret lab on that ship . Shannon McMahon is the only sure thing we have . We cut out on her , we risk coming up with both hands empty . If this is true about this ship and about this lab there may be answers there I can 't risk not knowing . Dr. NordIinger ? A message for you , sir . I want every hard drive . All the data you have in this butcher shop . Where is this captain supposed to be ? We 're supposed to meet him at a phone booth at 1 : 00 a.m. lt 's 00 : 50 . Somebody 's already there . is he calling you or meeting you ? I don 't know. lt wasn 't clear . He sees us . Hold up , there ! I said , hold up , there ! This ain 't no captain . Who is it ? Knowle Rohrer . Run ! Now ! Freeze ! fbi ! You didn 't trust me . - Do you see anybody ? - Nobody . - This can 't be right . - What happened to the captain ? I think we found the captain . They 're scuttling the ship . Agent Scully . Agent Reyes ! This must be it . Monica ! Dana ! Agent Scully ! Agent Reyes ! In here . - We got to get out of here . - Do you see what this is ? Agent Scully , we got to go ! The ship 's going to blow , Agent Scully ! They 're manipulating ova , female eggs , for transplantation . Look at these names . These are test subjects . Grab her . We 've got a minute to get out of here . - Just give me a second . - We 've got no time ! No , let go . Let me do this , okay ? I just have to see if I 'm here . My name . My baby 's name . Do you want to see your baby again ? We got no time , Dana ! We 'll find another way . Deputy Director . My sources tell me you 've wrapped up your investigation , John . I have my report ready , sir . Yes . How do I come out ? " Super soldiers . A Navy ship . " A woman at the Department of Justice who drowned two men ... " ... all disappeared now , but which constitute a conspiracy ... " ... like a cancer in the U.S. Government . " Not a mention of my name , John . No , sir . I found nothing on you . Nothing damning I could honestly include in my report , let me say . Because I got nothing to lose let me say that I know your hands are dirty on this thing , sir . Filthy . That 's why you 're here ? Take a last wild punch before the bell ? There 's one thing I can 't figure , and then I 'll be on my way : Why you slipped that obituary under my door . You think I did that ? Over and over in my mind , it had to be you . - You 're the only one that had a reason . - What 's my reason ? You tell me . You looking just to get me fired , or get me killed ? - You ever hear of King George lll ? - You answer my question ! He was king of England when America declared independence in 1 776 . King George lll kept a diary . On July 4 , 1 776 , he made an entry in it : " Nothing important happened today . " What the hell does that got to do with me ? Revolutions start . Things that change the world forever . And even kings can miss them , if they 're not paying attention . Are you saying you left that obituary to help me ? To help me find the things that I found ? No . - Why would I believe that you 'd help me ? - Agent Mulder believed me . Mulder ? What are you talking about ? Mulder 's long gone . Say I told Mulder that he would be killed if he stayed . Same people who threatened to kill me if I didn 't go along . - Would you believe that , John ? - No . Mulder wouldn 't hear it . Not from you or anybody . I said I told him to go . I didn 't say I persuaded him . Holy God . It was Scully . Scully made him go . That 's it , isn 't it ? You going to the basement ? I heard you got a stay of execution . Congratulations . I 'm sure you don 't mean that . No , I 'm sure the Deputy Director has you just where he wants you . Don 't get me wrong . I 'm a friend to the X-Files . Kind of a comfort having you down there Mr. Doggett . - Hi . - Hi . Just so long as you know where to reach us Mr. Follmer . Everything 's going to be okay . Go back to sleep , okay ? english

 Previously on Farscape . Katratzi . It 's the name of a place . The place where they took Aeryn . I gave you a chance . Where is Crichton ? Katratzi . That 's the name of the base . Where is it ? Disguises its presence by mirroring the orbit of one of the moons of Tralask . I know that planet . The female is pregnant . Her fetus must be saved . Is there a suitable recipient for transplant ? Please ... ( screaming ) What about Scorpius ? - What about him ? Well , he might have been captured . - Or killed . Harvey ? You 're not dead . I am the undead . That 's not funny . Scorpius knows everything you know . Memories , thoughts , dreams . Wormhole technology . No ! No . You must go back for him . And now on Farscape . Minister Ahkna : Where does it hurt , Scorpius ? Here ? Or here ? ( groaning ) ( gasping ) Tell me what you know about wormholes , hmm ? Even the smallest secret , and I 'll leave you in peace for an arn . I 've been searching my whole life for a female like you . ( trilling tongue ) ( screaming ) This is madness . Could be genius , Sparky . You know , there 's a very fine line between the two . Geniuses make plans . We 're going to walk into the most heavily guarded base in the Scarran Empire , start a civil war and walk out with Scorpius . What part of that do you not understand ? How you two can possibly believe it 'll work . D 'Argo : We 've been spotted . Scarran Flight Controller : Ko-nach ! Ko-nach ket ! Sikozu : Nach-ca vay-taf ver-ee yay-ret ! John Crichton , Ill-ka doz-ka-vet . Chiana : What did you just say ? Can 't you ever listen to the plans ? I told them that we 're escorting John Crichton , and he wants to join the negotiations . Oh , great . Now they 're guaranteed to blow us to hezmana . ( Aeryn whispering ) : Keep it down ! Scarran Flight Contoller : In noch het-za tye-um . They 've just given us clearance to dock . That 's it . I need it now . Rygel : It 's not too late to change our minds . Thank you . - That 's true . But we just passed the Jenek freighter , which means that Scorpius is probably nearby . That 's it ? That 's it . Mankind 's greatest contribution to the absurd . A thermonuclear bomb . ( ticking and whirring softly ) My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Grayza : Emperor Staleek . Despite what your Minister of War might believe , this offer of peace is genuine . Every day you fail to take it seriously , we build more and more wormhole weapons . Soon , the urge to use one will become irresistible . Staleek : Not to interrupt your bluster , but we have a guest who should make these talks even more amusing . John Crichton . And partner . What did we miss ? You 've taken a great risk coming here . Why shouldn 't I just have you seized right now ? Well , maybe this . What 's that ? Plutonium core , tritium shell . Does that translate ? A fission bomb . ( snorting ) Put those down ! Crichton : Nice threads . You must be the Emperor . Now , before anybody decides to get clever , you should know I have multiple deadman 's sensors from every culture on my ship and a few cultures I haven 't heard of . My heart stops , we all go boom . My heart speeds up , it 's boom again . Too hot , too cold , too happy , too sad , thirsty , hungry , bored , it 's John Lee Hooker time . Boom , boom , boom . And you try your little psychic trick , kaboom . And we 're all pushing up day-glo daisies . Why do I doubt that ? Because you lack imagination ? What do you want ? What do I ... want ? What do I want ? I have not been chasing my ass all over the galaxy , trying to pull out chunks of my brain . I have not been sneaking fembots and Skreeths into the places where I live . You want something . You . You want what 's inside my head . You want what I know about wormholes . Because I can leap tall galaxies in a single bound . I can scorch planets with a wave of my hand , and you , and you ... and you ? You can 't do jack . That 's not true . Oh , really ? You command the stars to do your bidding ? I know you can 't . And you can 't . And you won 't . But I have . Staleek : Then why are you here ? Because I am an American . And what does an American want ? Democracy ? Capitalism ! I want to sell out and settle down . For one day only , it 's a blue light special on aisle three . My wormhole technology , and a free set of steak knives , for all the tea in China . And anything you can imagine to pay me . Pay ? Yes , pay . Cash . He 's crazy . Isn 't it fun ? Welcome to my cold war . Now , what am I offered for all the powers of the universe ? I think Crichton 's bluffing . The bomb isn 't real , and he has nothing to give us . He 's come for Scorpius . We know they 're working together . At the Border Station , the two of them ... Get me a full analysis of Crichton 's weapon , and how to disarm it . Why would Crichton risk so much just to rescue an ally ? He may be in league with Commandant Grayza , to prevent Scorpius from giving us wormhole technology . Ridiculous . - It was Crichton 's females who rescued Grayza . From your clumsy attempt to abduct her . Oh ! - Another one of your failures , Minister Ahkna . Lovely of them to invite us in . They did not have much of a choice , did they ? Well , I think we 've located all of the surveillance devices . Pilot 's enhanced the encryption so Comms should be secure . Anyone have any problems , phone home , Fat Man and I will throw our weight around . You all know the plan . Ooh . Uh , no , refresh me . Wrinkles . - Yes ? Charrids . Mmm . Kalish . Recon . Peacekeepers ! Aeryn : A peace conference with the Emperor . Very brave of you to enter Scarran space . Could say the same for you . John Crichton . Do not destroy the Sebacean people . You don 't need me for that . You 're doing a great job on your own . Everything that I have done has been calculated to gain peace . So you betray the Luxans ? Maybe you should check your math . Give us wormhole weapons and everyone will be safe . Didn 't she say she already had that ? Mmm . We are very , very close . You know that we have sent Prowlers into wormholes . If I can buy peace , even for an arn or two , perhaps we can develop them . And what will you do ? Kill billions of your rivals ? Hey , maybe kill us . Then name your price , Crichton . Anything that you can imagine . Aye ... there 's the rub . You see ... I can 't figure a way out of this situation . But the first side that does ... wins . I 'm to allow them onto their ship ? If they wish . Crichton and his crew have negotiated full access to all common areas , and we will acquiesce , for the time being . Ah . Hey . Let me ask you something . You short-faced Scarrans , you all look alike , ya know ? But , uh , were you ... were you , uh , down ... down on the Border Station ? Yes . Then you were the one that , uh that ordered Aeryn and me to be cut open . ( chuckling ) Yeah . I got another one for you . Do Scarrans have mivonks ? ( grunting , then squealing ) Yes ... but they 're not external . Because the Kalish had no idea 'cause he 's a frelling hapooda ! ( both laughing ) Ah , don 't you Charrids ever bathe ? Listen , uh , the Scarrans have nothing decent to drink , and I won 't drink with the Kalish . Got any raslak ? Sit down . Thank you . Secretary Vakali ? What are you doing here ? This is a restricted area . I have urgent information . I believe the Charrids are trying to expel the Kalish from Katratzi by force . And who are you to possess such erroneous intelligence ? Just like you , I am a devoted Kalish . Without us to administer their empire , the Scarran system of governance will collapse . What if they fear you will take it away from them ? Please . Please , Secretary , we need to talk . Sir , you 're too prominent to be seen with her . I will speak to her . Ah ... Oh ... ( coughs ) That is terrible . Even the Scarrans should treat you better . What do you want , Luxan ? Me ? I 've got what I want . Oh ? You enjoy traveling with a group of thieves and a Hynerian slug ? ( laughing ) You would , too , if you were being paid what I 'm being paid . Which is what ? I think you better take that up with my employer . What 's this ? Dinner ? ( laughter ) " This " is opportunity . ( chuckles mischievously ) You will submit identification details before we can process a background analysis . I will not submit for a background appraisal . You will trust me as I am or I am gone . Now ... what of your background ? How many other Bioloids are here ? I am the one Resistance member to infiltrate this posting . How much hatred exists here between the Charrids and the Kalish ? Even more than the outer worlds . There 's more at stake . Bigger egos . Then I will be straight with you . We want to ignite that hatred and we want to use it as a cover for our escape . Will you help us ? 1812 , get that Scarran vacuum cleaner outta ' here . ( electronic chirping ) That 's a good boy . Do you think she 's figured it out yet ? I don 't think so . She still looks pretty damned stressed . I 'm not surprised . If she doesn 't go home with a peace treaty , she 's going to be in a lot of trouble with High Command . I reckon . As long as your stress levels are all right . Ah , well , considering the fact that we 're now nuclear terrorists . ( bomb beeping rhythmically ) Bomb seems to think I 'm okay . Provided that thing 's working . ( rapid beeping ) It 's working . ( chuckles ) Oh , you are dangerous . Well you better keep away , then . Sire . We have a good scan of Crichton 's fission device but decoding it could take some time . Not if you expect to prosper . You came back . Couldn 't figure a way to disarm my bomb , huh ? Not yet . Refreshment . Crystherium Utilia . An acquired taste . Streletzia . Hummingbird feeder . You know of our delicacy ? Bird of paradise ? Yeah , Mom 's garden . Dime a dozen . Did you come all this way to discuss botany ? - Or to make an offer ? Have you got anything to offer ? Or is all this just an elaborate bluff ? You don 't believe that I can control wormholes ? Would you believe without proof ? Fine . We 'll meet you halfway . Navigational data chip . Local star chart . Send a ship to the designated coordinates and let us know when they arrive . Why ? Proof . Crichton : Command performance . We 're gonna put on the wormhole show , just for you . Not interested , huh ? I 'm sure Grayza will be . Wait . Dispatch a Stryker with full instrumentation to these coordinates . Have you checked Crichton 's ship ? No . It 's protected by a force field . We may be able to override it . Do so . Check its logs , its star charts . Get all the information you can . This is folly . Crichton plainly knows nothing about wormholes . And Scorpius does ? We 'll soon find out . He 's ready for his final inquisitor . ( growls ) ( coughs ) Ahkna : You 're very resilient , Scorpius . It must be my Scarran genes . ( laughs ) We could trade places and find out . ( laughs ) How would you like to punish me ? If you want the pleasure of knowing , release me for an arn . Oh , I wish we had more time . But what I need to know now is what you do know about wormholes . You torture me and I will amuse myself with dreams of you . Kill me and my knowledge will die with me . Are you sure ? Even if an old friend helped you to the other side ? Stark ! There 's no way to escape , Scorpius . Not even into death . Because as you 're making your agonizing passage to the other side , I 'm going to capture your soul and with it , everything you know . ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( gasps ) Oh , I 've waited many a cycle for this , Scorpius . Dreamed so many sleepless dreams . Every dashed hope , every plunge into terrified despair that I suffered at your hands in the Aurora Chair . ( screaming ) But rather than the two cycles that fate gave you to screw with my soul , she 's only given me two arns to be finished with you . So , I guess I better be a little more imaginative . ( screaming ) I think this may have possibilities . ( screaming ) Listen to this . - What ? ( whispers ) : Listen . Can you hear that ? ( Scorpius moans ) That 's Scorpius . You sure ? - Yes , yes , I 'm sure . Completely . You go tell Crichton . I 'll try and find out where they 're keeping him . - Okay . Noranti : Scorpius can 't possibly hold out much longer . If he hasn 't broken already . Rygel ? Oh , the Scarrans will never make you rich . I can make you rich , if you come and work for me . - Rygel ? D 'Argo ( hushed ) : Rygel is busy at the moment , John . Crichton : Sikozu ? Everything is going to plan . The plan is too slow . Speed things up , please . Yeah , well , we 're going as fast as we can . I will try , but I 'll need some time , John . Why do we never have enough time ? Why should I go to work for a frelling Hynerian , when I 'm already a General in the Scarrans ' service ? Ha , that 'll end very soon , when the Scarrans sever all ties with the Charrids . You 're a lying slug ! They 're going to war with the Peacekeepers . But not with you as their allies . Just with the Kalish . Hah ! The Kalish are just Techs . Well , the Scarrans are building a wormhole weapon . They need Techs , not soldiers . Rygel : And the Kalish know it . That 's why they 're planning to sabotage the Charrids by embarrassing you in front of the Scarrans . They would never be so bold as to do that ! Ha ! They are as stupid as the Kalish say they are . Join me before the Scarrans throw you off this rock . Crichton 's fission device . It 's all just spare parts , mostly salvaged from devices I 've never seen before . I don 't care if it 's made out of your mother 's bones . I need to know how to disarm it . We just need a few solar days ... You don 't have them ! Either you 'll disarm it now , or I 'll find some species that will . ( growls ) ( whispers ) : What do you think ? It 's just like she said . The Charrids are trying to incite the Scarrans against us , and it 's starting to work . Crichton : And what about Scorpius ? Chiana : Uh , he 's somewhere on this level . Aeryn : All right . Well if we can 't make it to Lo 'La , we 're going to be looking for alternate escape routes . To the surface ? - Mm . I 'll keep looking . - Thank you . You have cost me a Stryker and its crew . Really ? How did I do that ? At your coordinates , a wormhole opened and swallowed them up ! What ... what did you do ? Oh , no . Do not tell me you ordered them into the wormhole . She told you to call us when they got there ! You should 've warned me ! Don 't lay this off on me ! You wanted proof , you got it . Did you cause that wormhole to open ? No . No more freebies . You wanna do a deal , or you want me to sell it to the Peacekeepers so they can gobble up all of your warships ? Do not threaten me . ( bomb beeping faster ) I 'm not threatening ? I 'm just a guy with something to sell . You don 't wanna buy it , I 'm sure someone else will . ( growls ) ( beeping slowing down ) I didn 't push him too hard , did I ? He 'll make an offer . An entire cavern just to grow the flowers they eat ? And it 's a high security area . Why ? We don 't know . But only the Charrids are supposed to have the access codes . So if anyone else enters the cavern , the Scarrans will assume the Charrids left it accessible . Like ... this . You stole the codes . Which is what the Charrids will suspect . And they will confront us . Crichton , we 've found a much faster way to incite a riot . Crichton : That 's great . Let me hear it ... later . Nice pants . Hey , Braca . You look a little lost . Aeryn : Does Mommy know you 're here ? Does Mommy know he 's Scorpius 's boy ? Oh , no . Mommy doesn 't know . Are you here to rescue him , or kill him ? ( Scorpius screaming ) Ahkna : Stark . Conceal yourself . ( growls ) Crichton : We 're here to see Scorpius . Come in . Just you . ( Scorpius gagging ) John ... Grasshopper . ( breath quivers ) That 's a nice hat . ( grunts ) Aeryn : Ahkna don 't ! What do you say ? Too happy ? Too sad ? Too cold ? Too hot ? Let 's see , hmm ? ( grunts ) Ahkna : I know you have a real nuclear device , but I 'm sure you can disarm it . Ahh , come on . I would , but I can 't , so I won 't . You 're bluffing . What ? So much for nuclear deterrents . Get ready to kiss your ass goodbye , Castro . ( beeping ) ( laughs ) ( gasps ) You 're insane . Release her . You all right ? Yeah . - You 're mad . Just played a game of chicken . Did I win ? Just . This time . You take the initiative next time . Aeryn : I 'll take it now . Not yet . Aeryn . You found Scorpius being tortured and you just left him there ? Crichton : It 's not time , yet . That 's why we 're here . Morning . As long as this helps start the conflict . Yes , it will . Might even get yourselves killed . Then we 'll all go together . Good luck . Well ... Give me your hand . Put it on my shoulder . Come here . All right , stand on my feet . Comfortable ? Mm-hmm . You ? Hold tight . ( giggles ) I don 't care what you think the Kalish might or might not do . The Scarrans would never dissolve our partnership . ( laughing ) What partnership ? You aren 't their partners . You 're nothing more than ill-paid , ill-treated and ... ( sniffing ) ... ill-smelling servants . ( roaring ) I don 't think so . Is this our floor ? I don 't know . Have to get out and have a look around . ( alarm sounding ) Intruder alert in the Crystherium chamber . Quick ! Check it . Now ! Hurry ! Never knew Scarrans were so sentimental . No one around . So . What do you want to do to get noticed ? I got arrested once . College . Let me show ya . What are you doing here ? Come out . Now ! Crichton : Damn . Up . Now ! It 's never enough time . ( zipping ) Who gave you the codes ? - What codes ? Crichton : ( Mexican accent ) Codes ? We didn 't need no stinkin ' codes . Ahkna : You could not have accessed the cavern without codes . We didn 't try to access anything . Some Charrids got off the elevator . We got on , we got off ... Well , we tried to get off . We got interrupted . Which Charrids ? Are you serious ? They all look alike . You should put numbers on their uniforms . The Charrid troops are your responsibility . I 'll order a full inquiry . You know , while you 're at it , give me Scorpius . You want Scorpius ? Why ? Is it because he 's going to give us what you 're trying to sell us ? No . Because the hat lady is pissing me off and I wanna piss her off . Tit for tat . Call it a whim . And I don 't like watching people be tortured who don 't know anything . What do you know about wormholes , Scorpius ? Tell me ! I know nothing ! You 're lying . You tell me . I said , I know nothing . Know nothing . It 's a normal part of the procedure . He , um , he 's strong . He 's very strong . That means , when he finally breaks , it 'll be all the more catastrophic . You promised me ... - That I would break him , not that he knows anything . But if he does , you will know ... What is happening in here ? - You wanted the information taken from him . Alive . I said alive . And have you learned anything ? - No , not yet , but I ... Crichton has destroyed a Stryker and found a way into the caverns . But you have achieved nothing . Get out . This is my jurisdiction . Not unless I say it is . Now get out . All of you . ( gaspsing ) I 'll get the truth from him . I thought you said she couldn 't harm you . And she couldn 't . I 'm fine . Quite fine . I 've caused enough harm in my time to mimic it well . We still haven 't found a way of disarming Crichton 's weapon . But he has demonstrated a convincing command of wormholes . I can separate him from the bomb . He trusts me . More than he realizes . Just bring him to me . Will you ? Or will you betray me ? I 've served you for ten cycles as a spy . Why would I betray you now ? Betray me and you will die in this machine . But deliver Crichton 's knowledge to me , and all the power you seek will be yours . Thank you for returning . What is it ? I would like to make an addition to my offer . I 'll have the Kung Pao chicken . You want a spring roll ? Actually , they 're a pardon from the Supreme Council . No Peacekeeper would dare violate them . She for real ? It would seem so . However , it is conditional . Of course . On no wormhole technology being shared with the Scarrans . What if we give these back ? Still valid . She wouldn 't dare destroy them . I 've witnessed them . So have all our principal officers . Keep it . We 'll let you know . ( grunting ) Guys , listen up . They 're bringing him now . One riot , well done , hold the mayo . Now . Your troops compromised the security of the cavern . No ! That is not what happened . We 're very close to a conflict now . This ain 't horseshoes or hand grenades . " Now " means now ! A bargain is struck . ( grunts ) However , an agreement requires trust , which thus far has been one sided . Now you tell me what else you really want . When you wake up in the morning on your big emperor bed , and you listen , what do you hear ? Do you hear the little emperor birdies singing outside your window ? Do you hear the emperor wind whistling through the trees ? Or do you hear people dying ? Do you hear your friends begging for mercy ? Do you hear doors being kicked in because people are hunting you ? Do you hear the sound of your heart pounding in your ears ? What I want , Santa Claus , For the rest of my life , I wanna wake up like an emperor . Your safety guaranteed . In just a few arns . Bill Gates can 't guarantee Windows . How you guarantee my safety ? With great effort , and great sincerity . Though at some point , my largesse will dissipate . My appreciation . My ass . Did you tell them ? ( wheezing ) : No . Wormholes ! My brain . Harvey . What did you tell them ? ! Nothing ! Listen up . I am Johnny Radiation because of you , Nosferatu . Everyone I care about west of the Moon is here and in danger to make sure that you keep your mouth shut . Now ! Did you keep your mouth shut ? Yes ! ( gasping ) John ... You believe him ? Yes , I do . ( gagging ) Good . Kill him and let 's go . - What ? Kill him and let 's go . - We came here to free him . No , we came here to make sure that my knowledge didn 't slip out of his mouth . Kill him , Aeryn , and let 's go . Oh , you want me to kill him ? - Well , I 'm not the assassin , am I ? If you want him to die , you can kill him yourself . You made me promise that I wouldn 't . - Well I release you from that promise . Say that again . - I release you from that promise . ( shuddering ) Thank you . I 'll give you my bike if you kill him . May I speak ? No . - No . He 's telling the truth . We 'll sort you out later . Guys , I apologize in advance for any incivility or insensitivity on my part , but it is beer o 'clock . where the hell is my riot ? The logs show your Lieutenant had just returned from the cavern . Whose logs ? His ? Kalish documentation . What are you implying , Rahzaro ? ( laughs ) : Oh ! You 're going to get it . That our intruder could not decipher the access codes to the cavern by himself . Someone had to have given them to him . I protest this baseless accusation . Then find out where the fault does lie . I expect a full account from each side in less than two arns . ( growls ) Ha ! Tear down the system to the foundation . Find the leak ! ( grunts ) I will not be humiliated by you , Vakali . You will not destroy my relationship with the Emperor . What the frell are you blathering about , Charrid ? Your security forces prove useless and you seek to refocus the blame ! Useless ? My forces , useless ? ! Ordering biscuits and repairing urinals has never won a war . And neither have you , if I recall . Insult a Charrid at your own risk , Kalish hapooda . " Hapooda " ? You dare to call me " hapooda " ? And I bet ... not a very good one . ( grunting ) ( yells ) ( groans ) ( yells ) ( yells ) Pennoch : What is this ? ( growls ) Stop it . Stop it at once . Strike Warriors to the Control Center . Confiscate all weapons ! Now , Crichton . Leave now . And never doubt your Dominar again . ( yells ) ( yells ) I must go . Sha-kana-sho . - Sha-kana-sho . ( gasps ) Go ! We 've been sabotaged . The Charrids and Kalish are fighting . Guards . Secure Crichton and report . Scorpius . We must secure Scorpius . Don 't worry about Scorpius . He 's not going anywhere . ( groans ) Everyone , go . We 're on the move . Some help would be appreciated . Where do you expect us to run ? Got a taxi waiting . First rule of piss poor planning : have your exit ready before your entrance . What ? This disturbance ? Yeah , pretty cool , huh ? - Yes , I 'm impressed . There 's just no pleasing some people . Remain where you are , or I 'll shoot . Release your weapons now . ( yells ) Braca ? Yeah , feel the love , Mr. Burns . Frell . Hey , can you help us ? We 're ... we 're afraid . You have to turn back . Can 't pass here . ( exhales ) ( groans ) ( thud ) It works ! We 're getting close . Don 't leave without us . Warrior . Can you take this Kalish piece of tralk ? What do you want me ... Both : Nice . Hurry up ! - We try it a third time ? Warrior . - What ? Could you take this Kalish piece of tralk ? We 're almost home . There it is . Scorpius : D 'Argo 's vessel , even shrouded cannot outrun a Stryker ! Moya 's disguised as an ore freighter in the shipping yards . She 's rested and ready to Starburst . Oh , crap . Aeryn . We can broker a bargain . Where 's your nerve , Grasshopper ? Just stick with me , they ain 't gonna pop Fat Man . I can 't ! ( gurgling ) You better not pass out . Get up , or I kill you now . Choose . You need to know when a woman 's serious . Are you coming ? ( gagging ) ( gasps ) Okay . Drop your weapons . Don 't fire or you 'll detonate the bomb . ( grunting ) Well there you go . Someone finally got smart . ( gags ) ( grunts ) You stupid son of a bitch ! I 'm sorry , John , but you need to breathe deeply if you expect to live . You 're gonna get us all killed ! ( bomb beeping ) Now , if you trust me enough to live , you may well discover the truth . Trust you ? Trust you ? ( screaming ) ( bomb alarm beeping )

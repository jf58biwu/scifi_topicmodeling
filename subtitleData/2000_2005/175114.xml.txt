 Crimes of the Hot Hurry up with the water . I 'm steaming inside my own shell , I am . It 's that hot , it is . Man , it 's hot . How hot is it ? It 's so hot , I poured McDonald 's coffee in my lap to cool off . [ CHUCKLING ] Johnny Carson said it . [ PANTING ] No , Nibbler ! Don 't drink the pool water ! It 's full of chlorine . [ GROANING ] [ BURPING ] [ COUGHING ] [ LAUGHING ] Lightweights . Oh , wait , chlorine . [ SIGHING ] Perhaps this movie will help take our minds off the heat . BENDER : Focus ! ANNOUNCER : Global Warming or : None Like It Hot ! [ SOBBING ] You 're probably wondering why your ice cream went away . Well , Suzie , the culprit isn 't foreigners . It 's global warming . - Gwobal wap-po ? - Yeah . Meet Mr. Sunbeam . He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth . Hello , Earth . Just popping in to brighten your day . La-la-la-la-la-la-la . And now I 'll be on my way . Not so fast , sunbeam . We 're greenhouse gases . You ain 't going nowhere . [ SCREAMING ] Oh , God , it hurts ! ANNOUNCER : Pretty soon , Earth is chock-full of sunbeams their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere . [ CHUCKLING ] How do we get rid of the greenhouse gases ? Fortunately , our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap ... ... Iast-minute way to combat global warming . Ever since 2063 , we simply drop a giant ice cube ... ... into the ocean every now and then . Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning . And then he gets mad . Of course , since the greenhouse gases are still building up ... ... it takes more and more ice each time . Thus , solving the problem once and for all . - But-- - Once and for all ! Well , we just need one of those big ice cubes . Call the losers who were supposed to deliver it . [ PHONE RINGS ] - Hello ? - President Nixon here . I 'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice . And hurry up . I 'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle . You heard the good news , everyone . Save the Earth , et cetera , et cetera . Bye . - Wait . Where do we get the ice ? - The what ? Oh , Halley 's comet , of course . The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don 't have bugs in them . Wow . Mining a comet . That sounds fun . Yes . There 's no safer occupation than mining . Especially when you 're perched on a snowball ... ... whipping through space at a million miles an hour . Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Safe . Deploying ice drill . Wow . That ice dispenser 's so big the ice crushes you . - Yakov Smirnoff said it . - No , he didn 't . Activating ice drill . Oh , my God ! It 's out of ice ! Like some outer-space Motel 6 . Completely out of ice ? This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it . Also life . With Halley 's comet out of ice Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of intense global warming . Morbo is pleased but sticky . The scorching heat has melted the polar icecaps causing floods of biblical proportion . They called me crazy for building this ark . You are crazy . You filled it with same-sex animal couples . Hey ! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don 't like . MORBO : Direct your pity now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland . That poor turtle . - Bender , are you crying ? - No . Never . Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace amongst the Dutch tulips . I 'm sure those windmills will keep them cool . Windmills do not work that way ! Good night ! Well , everybody , I just saved a turtle . What have you done with your lives ? You went all the way to Holland already ? Bender , a turtle isn 't yourself . Why do you care about it ? Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself . Like poor little Shelly here . What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix ? For one thing , we both have a tough outer shell . But lead a rich , inner life . And also ... ... well , you know . You 're both alcoholic , whore-mongering , chain-smoking gamblers ? No . It 's just ... ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back . What ? I 've seen you get up off your back tons of times . - Those times I was slightly on my side . - Interesting . Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours , Bender . No , that 's not necessary , really . I think I hear my factory recalling me . That 's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you . MAN OVER SPEAKER : Calling all scientists . There will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto , Japan . I 've got a degree in homeopathic medicine . You 've got a degree in baloney . - Professor Farnsworth , you 're a scientist . - Forget it . I 'm not going . I have my reasons . Shut up , all of you ! Strange . You haven 't acted this suspicious since I found the " ape bones " in the basement . My hip hurts . I 'm in the middle of cooking a turkey . I have warranty cards to fill out . I am not just making excuses . All right , I 'll go ! WOMAN : I can 't believe it ! I love you ! It 's Professor Hubert Farnsworth ! He 's looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks . His wristwatch is a Casio . Thank you all for coming . It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention . The inventor of the environment and first emperor of the moon , AI Gore . I have ridden the mighty moon worm . [ CHEERING ] Good for him . My fellow Earthicans , as I discuss in my book , Earth in the Balance ... ... and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth ... ... we need to defend our planet against pollution , as well as dark wizards . Sure , blame the wizards . That 's why I 'm offering a bag of moon sapphires ... ... to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all . CROWD : Ah ... . Ooh ... . - Lovely , aren 't they ? - Sapphires ? With those , I could open the gate of Girash . First up is Professor Ogden Wornstrum . Wornstrum ! [ CLEARS THROAT ] Ladies and gentlemen , I have placed in orbit a giant mirror ... ... that will reflect 40 percent of the sun 's rays , thus cooling Earth . Observe . [ SIGHING ] Problem solved . [ CHUCKLING ] [ GASPING ] That 's a little bright . [ SCREAMING ] All right . What else we got ? Professor , you 're a professor . You must have some ideas . Absolutely not ! I won 't speak . I 've got nothing to hide . - Our next speaker is Professor- - - I demand the floor ! - Yes , it 's your turn to speak . - Well , nuts to me . I 'm taking the stage . I know the source of the greenhouse gases ... ... but in my shame , I 've kept it secret for 75 long years . Oh , it haunts my memory still . - Professor , no ! Don 't do it ! - Don 't do what ? Don 't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then ? It was October 1 7 at 1 : 54 p.m. and 1 4 birds were flying by the window . I was working at Mom ' s Friendly Robot Company . Back then , robots were slow-moving , stiff and a little on the uptight side . Oh , dear , might I favor master with a tender kiss on the forehead ? Oh , I 've failed again . Oh , dear . Oh , dear . Oh , dear . FARNSWORTH : The company 's owner pressured me to create a sportier robot . Stop ! It wasn ' t easy . But by sacrificing fuel efficiency , I succeeded . - What was that ? - A flaming burp . - Does it always do that ? - It 's not always a burp . We still have one problem , though . This robot would never meet emission standards . Crap spackle ! We 'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck . Well ... ... I suppose the environment can take one more for the team . What a fool I was ! If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot but I was tired and in love . Take me now , you stud . [ YAWNS ] Oh , this is all my fault ! That 's awful , professor . Especially the making-out part . Yeah , I didn 't need to hear that . All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs ... ... and that 's the cause of global warming today . So the robots are to blame , as I suspected . We are left with only one possible course of action , grim though it be . I got a good feeling about this . We must immediately and permanently ... ... shut down , dismantle and destroy all robots ! [ GASPS ] - Wait ! Surely there 's a better- - - The conference is over . I must go now to help collect cans on Jupiter . Peace out , y 'all . ALL : Destroy all robots ! Destroy all robots ! - Poor Bender . - Be brave , my friend . Come on . You 've got to come out of your chest sometime . Would you do it for a Bender snack ? FRY : Ah-ha ! - Gotcha ! BENDER : Let me go ! I don 't even want the stupid beer . Yes ! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest . But who has the beer now ? [ LAUGHING ] I 've got mail . It 's a party , apparently . Do you like to party ? To boogie down ? Well , I 'm throwing an all-night beach rager for my robot pals . It all goes down this Saturday on the isolated Galápagos Islands ... ... where there will be no escape ... ... from the fun . All robots must attend ! Strange . Why would Nixon , an awkward , uncomfortable man , throw a party ? One of the most social events imaginable ? It 's a trap is why ! They 're going to deactivate all the robots . - I don 't hear any gasping . - We all figured that out . - Oh ... . - Well , I 'm off . We can hide you . We 'll pile fruit on you and claim you 're a bowl . - No . I 'm going to the party . - I won 't let you ! Fry , as you know , there are lots of things I 'm willing to kill for . Jewels , vengeance , Father O 'Malley 's weed whacker . But at long last , I 've found something I 'm willing to die for . This mindless turtle . Bender , this world isn 't good enough for you . Not even close . Goodbye , everybody . Don 't touch my stuff after I 'm dead . It 's booby-trapped ! [ " GET DOWN TONIGHT " PLAYS ] [ CHEERING ] Oh , yeah , baby ! Come on . Come on , baby . Poor guy . Maybe you 'd feel better if I had a drink . Crummy keg , it 's completely tapped- - - Oh , you 're a robot . - Don 't stop . - Ew ! - Attention , happening robots . Who 's got what it takes to party with Nixon ? [ BURPING ] You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours ... ... and be sure not to leave the island for at least two hours . I 'm going out to pick up some smokes . Really good smokes . Two hours . [ CHEERING ] Okay , headless body of Agnew , let 's blow this joint . [ GROWLING ] BIG ROBOT : Do you want to dance ? - No , I 'm not really in the- - You know you want to . [ GRUNTING ] Per your orders , I modified my mirror ... ... to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galápagos . Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated . Now , for your part of the bargain . Very well . Agnew , you belong to Wornstrum now . [ GROWLING ] I 'll say goodbye now . There ain 't no turtles where Daddy 's going . Don 't tell anybody , but Nixon 's about to shut all the robots off and- - What ? [ SCREAMS ] ROBOTS : We 're gonna die ! We 're going to the great beyond . Nixon 's not bringing the smokes . Shut up and pay attention to me . Bender . Look , I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here . Except perhaps you , Hedonism Bot . But we need to be shut off ! Especially you , Hedonism Bot . - I apologize for nothing . - We pollute too much ! We 're destroying the world and killing the turtles ! - To hell with the turtles ! - No one insults the turtles ! Come on , you ! Let the games begin . [ CHUCKLING ] [ GASPING ] Everyone listen ! Ah ! Damn ! I 've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time . Granted , you 're all blasting out greenhouse gases . You 're one to talk . But we can use those very gases to save the planet . If you all vent your exhausts directly upward in one burst ... ... it should thrust the Earth further from the sun , thus cooling it . [ MUMBLING ] By my calculations , we 'll need the full force of every last robot . So quickly , everyone point your exhaust vents straight upward . Now vent . Vent like the wind ! [ BURPING ] Harder ! Harder ! Why isn 't this working ? Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in . [ GRUNTING ] Help ! Help ! [ WORNSTRUM LAUGHING ] A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished . Oh , the Jedis are going to feel this one . I 'm sorry , buddy . At least we 'll die on our backs , helpless . What the hell are you doing ? Hey , are you trying to make me look bad ? Ah-ha ! I 'm even greater than I thought I was . And now to fulfill my destiny ! Fire ! - What the- - ? - We missed ! [ GROWLING ] NIXON : Professor , for saving the Earth and foiling me ... ... I proudly , yet angrily , present you with Earth 's new highest honor : The Polluting Medal of Pollution . Thank you . I deserve this . Hey , professor ? Now that the Earth 's orbit ... ... is further from the sun , won 't that make the year longer ? Why , yes . One week longer to be exact . In that case , I hereby declare it Robot Party Week ! BENDER : All right , baby ! [ " HOT HOT HOT " PLAYS ] [ COUGHING ]

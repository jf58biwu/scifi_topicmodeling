 Dr. Longenhahn , here 's the body . They weren 't kidding , were they ? They said they did about the best they could ... considering he was all mashed in with that garbage . How mashed up is he ? Basically , it 's hamburger . Oh . And they want me to do what exactly ? The order was to establish and confiirm real fact of death . I 'd say he 's dead . How about you ? - Yes , sir . - Good . I 'm going home . You fax me the paperwork by 9 : 00 , I 'll sign it , everybody 's happy . Oh , cryin ' out loud . See this ? They left some garbage in with it . Looks kinda like a vertebrae , only metallic . Note it on the report . Then fax me . Oh , God . I was hoping this was all a dream . - When 'd the sun come up ? - About six hours ago . - Somewhere back in North Carolina . - Where are we ? We just crossed into Georgia . A long way from home , Agent Scully . Under the circumstances . Right . We can 't be too safe . Are you all right , Agent Reyes ? I should ask how you 're doing . I mean , you 're the one who 's gonna have this baby . That 's it , isn 't it ? What you 're really worried about ? Aside from whatever danger we 're in ... where we 're going doesn 't sound like ... there 's all that much in the way of a facility . You know what I mean ? I ... I 've never delivered a baby . Well , I 've never had one . That makes us both beginners . This is a videograph from the D.C. Morgue . - It 's Billy Miles . - How can that be ? It can 't be . It 's impossible . Yeah , it can 't be , but it is ... walking out of the morgue lookin ' like a new man . His body was taken to the morgue in a little box , for God 's sake . Like I told ya , you can 't stop him . Yeah , you know , you keep saying that , Krycek . Why don 't you explain it to us because I 'm having a little bit of a hard time ... understanding it myself . Billy Miles was scraped out of the back of a garbage truck . I saw him go in . I saw him come out . Well , I don 't know if I can explain it in any technical sense , but ... that 's Billy Miles without a doubt . You 're sitting there for one reason , Krycek , because you can 't explain it . I told you he 's a human replacement . Some new kind of alien ... created to aid in the repopulation of the planet . - Which Scully 's a threat to . - If she has that baby . I don 't care who he is or what you think he 's made of ... there 's no way he 's gonna fiind her , no way . Well , maybe he 's not , but there are others out there just like him . And it 's only a matter of time before they will . Agent Doggett ? See you a moment ? There 's someone here to see you . The name is Knowle Rohrer . He says you know each other and what he 's here for can 't wait . End of the road . Yeah , literally . If anybody fiinds us out here , it really will be a miracle . - Where exactly are we ? - Democrat Hot Springs . According to Agent Doggett , this is where people used to come for their waters ... until the springs dried up and they quit coming . - He was born here . - Really . Well , that 's comforting . I guess . - So where do you want to set up ? - Over here . Any particular reason ? I think I told you I feel these energies about people and stuff ... and places . I found it works best to go with my instincts . I 'm getting a feeling myself . Well , there 's no water from this rock . We 're gonna need some water and a place to boil it . Along with sterile supplies and a clean place to do this delivery . I 'm a little stiff from the drive . Okay . It 's not like you , Knowle . Comin ' to see me when you make me work so hard to see you . This couldn 't wait , John . It 's about this thing you 're pursuing . - This thing ? - This man you 're after . I think you know what I 'm talking about . I think I 'm confused , Knowle ... if it 's a man or it 's a thing . This is military , John . Goes all the way to the top . I can 't overstate the sensitivity . Let me say there was a rumored program out of the Cold War ... planned to create a super soldier . Well , this kid I 'm talking about was pretty damn super . Got right up out of a gut bucket and hit the ground running . The kid wasn 't exactly what I 'd call military material . In fact , they say he was an alien abductee . - You got it half right , John . - Which half ? What you 're chasing ... is a prototype . Uh-huh . And this so-called prototype ... - what is he after ? - I think you know that too , John . He 's after your partner Scully . You may not be aware that she was part of a program herself . Six years ago , Agent Scully was taken in a military operation ... staged as an abduction . They put a chip in the back of her neck to monitor her . It was also used to make her pregnant ... with the fiirst organicversion of that same super soldier . What do you want from me ? Help us catch him so we can put him down ... before he fiinds her . You assume I know where she is . Who does , your superior ? Whoever knows , his life is in danger too . I want you to know . Sit down , Krycek ! Hey , what did I tell you ? Hey ! Krycek ! Krycek , hold the door ! Hold the door , Krycek ! Krycek ! Mulder . You heard about this , right ? - How is he ? - He 's got a concussion . They 're gonna keep him here for observation . Where were you when this all happened ? In my offiice , talking to somebody who warned me this might happen . Who ? Skinner could have been killed . He 's lucky he wasn 't . He 's an old friend . He tells me stuff I 'm not supposed to know . - I didn 't wanna believe it . - What exactly did he tell you ? He said that Billy Miles isn 't what you think he is . He 's a product of a government program lookin ' to build a super soldier . He said Agent Scully 's a part of that program too . And her pregnancy was triggered by a chip they put in her neck . I want to know who the hell you 've been talking to ! Who this trusted source of yours is , who 's been spinning this fantasy . His name 's Knowle Rohrer . He 's deep inside U.S. Intelligence - I don 't know much more than that . - Did he ever lie to you ? Give you bad information ? False leads ? - You have to think about it ? - He said Scully 's in danger . He wants to stop this guy . How 's that so different from what we 're saying ? You didn 't tell him where she is , did you ? No . But I 'm beginning to think that the fact that I know ... is gonna catch up with me if A.D. Skinner 's any indication . You don 't tell anybody where she is . That 's the deal , right ? Not even me . What if something happens to me ? This , uh , trusted source of yours ... told you he knows how to stop Billy Miles . Did he happen to tell you how he plans to do this ? - No . - Right . What do you say you and me go find out how trustworthy he really is ? Dana , come see what you think . Oh , my goodness ! Look at this . Look at you . Wow ! I found them folded up in a cabinet upstairs ... and a nice porcelain basin and a whole box of candles . Do we have matches ? - I 've got a lighter . - Yeah . Now all we need is some mood music . - Like \ x22Whale Song . \ x22 - \ x22Whale Song \ x22 ? They 've got these recordings of whales talking to each other , calling back and forth . I-I don 't know , it 's like , it 's almost metaphysical . You 're looking at me like ... I don 't know . I probably sound like a goof . No , no , it 's not that . Um , I was thinking that you reminded me of someone that I was close to . - My sister . - You 're not close to her still ? Uh , she was killed about fiive years ago ... in my home . It was a terrible time . Well , it 's , uh , it 's okay . I want to thank you . Thank you for ... putting this together . It 's not what I planned , but , um , it 's very nice . What ? There 's someone out there . Stay here . Get out of the car ! I 'm a federal agent ! I don 't care who you are . Let 's start by putting that weapon away . Just point it down now . - I 'm a federal agent . - I heard you the fiirst time . Just let me see some identifiication . Dana ? I 'm sure this looks untoward , but my life is in danger . And my baby 's . There 's a man who 's pursuing us and it is very important that he not find us here . We get hunters in here ... taking deer and game off-season . I 've heard every excuse in the book , but this one 's far too original . You don 't plan to have it here ? It 's not as crazy as it sounds . I mean , I hope it 's not . She 's a doctor . She can coach me . And what if something goes wrong ? If you 're a doctor , you know the risks . - You 're unprepared here . - This man ... he 's extremely dangerous . I got a fiirst-aid kit in my truck . It 's pretty basic , but better to have than not . I 'll be back with some towels and the proper swaddling . Thank you . and then when we want to reach him , all of a sudden , he 's unreachable ... - nowhere to be found . - Maybe he got wind . Maybe he got spooked . But I 'm beginning to think it doesn 't make a damn bit of difference . You told me that he told you he knew how to stop Billy Miles . Are you telling me now that you think he 's a liar ? He is or he isn 't . What the hell difference does it really make ? It doesn 't make any difference at all ... unless you wanna protect Scully and that baby . And then what ? How long can you keep this up ? How long until the next Billy Miles rears his head ? The next threat ? The next phantom ? Do you ever stop to ask yourself ? All the sacrifiice , the blood spill . You 've given nearly a decade of your life . Where the hell is it all gonna end ? I don 't know . Maybe it doesn 't . - Start the car . - What ? Alex Krycek just pulled in . What the hell 's he doing here ? How did he get security clearance ? Do you recognize his passenger ? Yeah , it 's Knowle Rohrer . Thank you . Thank you . I have to say , with everything I know you must be feeling ... you look amazingly beautiful , Dana . And what about what you 're feeling ? Any vibrations , Agent Reyes ? - I don 't know . - What ? I don 't know if I 'm just being paranoid ... but something feels off . We need some more water . Go back inside , Dana ! Who is it ? Dana , it 's okay . He 's dead . No , it 's not okay . What do you mean ? Exactly what I said . Now go on inside . We 'll take care of this . They said that he couldn 't be stopped . Dana , he 's got no vitals . He 's lost too much blood . Is this the man you 're afraid of ? How did he find you out here ? I do have to report this thing . - No , you can 't do that . - I don 't have any real choice . No , I mean , I-I just felt a contraction . Something 's happening . - Where 's he going ? - Not to see you , that 's for sure . Who the hell 's he going to see ? You go ahead . I got Krycek . Agent Doggett ? - What are you doing here ? - They let me out of the hospital tonight . What are you doing here ? I got Mulder down in the parking garage watching Alex Krycek . What the hell is Krycek doing here ? That 's what I 'm trying to fiigure out . - Yeah ? - He 's here with Agent Crane . Agent Crane ? How the hell does he know Agent Crane ? That 's a damn good question . He doesn 't . You been wondering who 's getting these guys past security , how Billy Miles is in the F.B.I. ? Agent Crane is in on this with your friend , which means he 's in on it with Krycek . - They 've been in on it all along . - I don 't understand . In on what ? Fooling us , Agent Doggett . Into chasing after Billy Miles . Into believing we could protect her . - Scully ? - Yes , they know where she is . - No , no . Only I know where she is . - You and Agent Reyes . You called her from a phone inside the F.B.I. , didn 't you ? There 's no way Crane can tap calls in here , Mulder . He 'd have to have access to the communications system . - Skinner 's here with me . - Maybe this goes even higher . Listen to me , I got to get to Scully . You gotta tell me where she is , where you sent her . Look , we can nail these guys here , Mulder . We can put an end to it . No , you listen . You gotta get out of there . You got no guarantee ... that these guys aren 't alien replacements too . Northern Georgia . A place called Democrat Hot Springs . Mulder ! Get out of the car . Doesn 't seem fair now . Doesn 't seem right . Coming down to this . What do you know about fair or right , Krycek ? You 're a coward . I could 've killed you so many times , Mulder . You gotta know that . I 'm the one that kept you alive . Praying you 'd win somehow . Then there really is no God . You think I 'm bad , that I 'm a killer . We wanted the same thing , brother . That 's what you don 't understand . I wanted to stop them . All you wanted was to save your own ass . No . I tried to stop them . Tried to kill Scully 's baby to stop them . It 's too late . The tragedy is that you ... you wouldn 't let it go . That 's why I have to do this . 'Cause you know how deep it goes . Right into the F.B.I. You wanna kill me , Alex , kill me . Like you killed my father . Just don 't insult me trying to make me understand . It 's gonna take more bullets than you can ... ever fiire to win this game . But one bullet ... and I can give you a thousand lives . Shoot Mulder . I 'm going to go to the airport . I need that location from Agent Doggett . - Skinner , are you with me ? - You just go . I 'll get him . They 're two minutes apart now . It 's not going to be long . - How 's this ? - That 's great . Right there ! Both of you ! I 'm prepared to use force ! - Come on . Come on ! - Agent Doggett . Here you go . Thank you . Thank you . Move ! Agent Reyes , what ? Move out of here ! What 's happening ? Who are you ? This baby will be born . Agent Reyes ! The Blazer ! Get Mulder on the phone . What 's happening ? Huh ? What ? - It 's okay , Dana . - What ? No ! - It 's going to be okay . - No ! Get him off ! - This is my baby ! - You gotta push , Dana ! Please don 't let them take it ! - Come on , Dana . Push ! - God ! Please don 't let this happen . - Dana , push ! - It 's mine ! Hold on ! Harder ! Push , Dana ! - Keep breathing , Dana . Keep breathing . - Please don 't let them take it ! Push ! Push ! Push , Dana , push ! Down there . Get me down there . Scully . Scully ! Where is she ? Scully ! Where is she ? Scully ! - Where is she ? Tell me where she is ! - Mulder ! - How is she ? - She 's inside . She needs to get to the hospital . I 'm to take this story seriously ? These incidents at the F.B.I. This account of Agent Scully 's birth . I 'm to submit this report as quality investigative work ? As representative of actual fact ? I signed the report there , sir . Yeah , I see it , John . And I see her signature here too . On an X-File . I 'd like to know when you assigned yourself , Agent Reyes ? Agent Doggett assigned me , sir . Agent Doggett cannot just assume the authority of this offiice . I assume it because this offiice is under investigation ... for the late-night meeting between you , Agent Crane ... and an intelligence operative named Knowle Rohrer . Both men were presumed dead , but are now missing . In actual fact . You investigate what I tell you . And you put me on the X-Files . That 's what I 'm investigating . - Get some rest . - Yeah . - We didn 't hear you come in . - We were just dropping off gifts . - We just wanted to ... - See it with your own eyes . It 's incredible , you know ? You arriving in time to save Scully . - Getting her to a hospital . - We still don 't know how you did it . Speaking with Agent Doggett , he said they never reached you with specifiic coordinates . There was a light . I followed it . Guess we got our next headline . How 's everybody doing ? We 're doing just fline . Hey , now . None of that . Hi . What are you gonna call him ? William . After your father . Well , I don 't know . He 's got your coloring and your eyes ... but he looks suspiciously like Assistant Director Skinner . I don 't understand , Mulder . They came to take him from us . Why they didn 't ... I don 't quite understand that either . Except that maybe he isn 't what they thought he was . That doesn 't make him any less of a miracle though , does it ? From the moment I became pregnant ... I feared the truth ... about how ... and why . And I know that you feared it too . I think what we feared were the possibilities . The truth we both know . Which is what ?

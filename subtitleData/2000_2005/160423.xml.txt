 Time passes in moments ... moments which rushing past ... define the path of a life ... just as surely as they lead towards its end . How rarely do we stop to examine that path ... to see the reasons why all things happen . To consider whether the path we take in life is our own making , or simply one into which we drift with eyes closed . But what if we could stop , pause to take stock ... of each precious moment before it passes ? Might we then see the endless forks in the road that have shaped a life ? And seeing those choices , choose another path ? I see the storm has broken ... in the middle of the night . Nothing left here for me . It 's washed away . The rain pushes the buildings aside . - I got the lab to rush the results of ... - The sky turns ... I said , I got the lab to rush the results of the Szezesny autopsy , if you 're interested . - I heard you , Scully . - Szezesny did indeed drown . But not as the result of the inhalation of ectoplasm as you so vehemently suggested . What else could she have possibly drowned in ? Margarita mix . Upchucked with about 40 ounces of Corcovado Gold tequila , which ... as it turns out , she and her friends rapidly consumed in the woods ... while trying to reenact The Blair Witch Project . I think that demands a little deeper investigation , don 't you ? No , I don 't . Well , it doesn 't matter , 'cause we got bigger fish to fry . Have a seat , Scully . Check this out . - Is that beautiful or what ? - Crop circles , Mulder ? Computer-generated crop circles . It 's a fractal image predicted by a computer program using data ... of every known occurrence of the phenomena over the past 40 years . What most people don 't realize is that since 1991 ... - There 's been a dramatic increase ... in size and complexity of circle designs . That 's when the Mandlebrot Set appeared in England ... a series of geometrically perfect rings appearing almost impossibly overnight ... in a field near Cambridge . But that was merely prelude of what was to come . Three years later in 1994 , even more complex formations occurred simultaneously ... on opposite ends of the English countryside with the Mandlebrot Set , where it 's still there at its center . Then in 1997 , even more complex formations occurred . And I 'm not wearing any pants right now . - Hmm ? - You 're not listening . I am . I guess I just don 't see the point . The point is that a computer program has shown us ... that these are not just random happenstance coincidental occurrences . And that same program has predicted that in just 48 hours ... even more complex formations are gonna be laid down in a field near Avebury . Forty-eight hours , Scully , but I wouldn 't mind getting there earlier , if you don 't mind . - Getting where ? - England . I got two tickets on a 5 : 30 flight . Mulder , I still have to go over to the hospital and ... finish the final paperwork on that autopsy you had me do . And to be honest , it 's Saturday . And I wouldn 't mind , I don 't know , taking a bath . - What the hell does that mean ? - What it means is that I 'm not interested ... in tracking down some sneaky farmers who happened to ace geometry in high school . And besides , what could you possibly get out of this ? Or learn ? I mean , it 's not even remotely FBI related . I 'll just cancel your ticket . Thanks for lunch . Mulder . Look , we 're always running . We 're always chasing the next big thing . Why don 't you ever just stay still ? I wouldn 't know what I 'd be missing . My name is Dana Scully ... and I was told I could pick up a postmortem folder for a Miss Szezesny here . It 's for the FBI . Let 's see . Oh . And just sign here , please . Thank you . Hi . Um , I was given the wrong test results . This X ray marked D. Waterston was in the envelope marked Szezesny . I was expecting autopsy results . I 'm sorry . They must have gotten switched . Sorry for the inconvenience . Thank you . Is the , um ... Is the D. Waterston that was on the X ray , is that a Dr. Daniel Waterston ? Waterston , Waterston . Yes , it is . Admitted yesterday , coronary care unit , room 306 . Thank you . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what else to say . Everything appears to be as it should , under the circumstances . So , don 't worry . If you 'd like , I could show you the hospital cafeteria . Uh , I guess ... Yeah , okay . Are there phones down there too ? I need to make some phone calls . Yes . - Excuse me . Can I help you with something ? Uh , I 'm sorry . I 'm Dr. Scully . I was just in the hospital and ... Can we step into the hallway ? Yeah . I 'm Dr. Waterston 's cardiologist , Paul Kopeikan . You say your name was Scully ? Uh , yes , Dana Scully . - Dr. Waterston 's mentioned you . - I 'm sorry . You must be mistaken . You were a student of his , right ? He has a heart condition ? Dr. Waterston came in yesterday with severe chest pains . And he ordered us to do an echocardiogram ... and a biopsy because he 'd had symptoms ... of an upper respiratory infection the week before . Fortunately , it was the right call . - Then it 's serious . - But treatable . - I have to wake him up soon if you 'd care to ... - No . That 's all right . But thanks for your time . He must have been a wonderful teacher . I 've been following his work on constrictive pericarditis for years now . Yes . He 's a remarkable man . - Hello ? - You came to see him . I 'm sorry . Who is this ? - Margaret Waterston . - Maggie . Is everything all right ? - Well , that depends , doesn 't it ? - I 'm sorry ? Whatever . Dr. Kopeikan told my father you were here , and now he wants to see you . - About what ? - Look . He asked me to call , so I 'm calling . I don 't know , Maggie . I-I ... I don 't know if I 've got time . - Don 't know if you have the time . - Maggie , can you hang on a second ? I have another call . - Listen . It 's your choice , but if you come , it doesn 't mean I accept you being in his life . Hello ? I 'll never see you again . - Hello ? - Hey , you 're there ? - Hey . - Mulder , aren 't you supposed to be on a plane ? I got a 5 : 30 flight , remember ? Right . I guess I lost track of time . Listen , the reason I called ... Am I catching you at a bad time ? No , I just walked in . Why ? There 's this group in D.C. that is researching crop circles , and they 've got a totally different set of coordinates from the one I got already . - Mulder , I 'm not going . - I gotta ask you a favor . One of the researchers lives out near the hospital ... and they 've got these sensitive photos and data and stuff that they won 't fax to me . So I was wondering if you would go over there and , you know , and get it and put it in ... Speak to me , Scully . I 'm out for the evening , Mulder . - Well , why didn 't you just say so in the first place ? - Look . Why don 't you leave that address on my answering machine ... and , uh , I 'll try it for you . I 'm sorry . I ... I have the wrong room . That 's okay . Hi . Do I have to lock eyes with the devil for you to grace me with your presence ? Surely not the devil . How are you feeling , Daniel ? It 's a real drag when the body doesn 't wanna play anymore . You 're extremely lucky you called that diagnosis . Luck has nothing to do with it , Dana . That 's what doctors do every day . You may have forgotten that . Daniel . So , how did you happen to be here in Washington ? That 's a long story . - How 's the FBI ? - Is that why you wanted to see me ? To remind me once again what a bad choice I made ? Believe me , my motivation is far more selfish than that . You scare me , Daniel . I know . I scare you ... because I represent that which is ingrained , not only in your mind , but in your heart ... that which you secretly long for . You never accepted my reason for leaving . It wasn 't a reason . It was an excuse . But you understood why . I can 't believe the FBI is a passion . Not like medicine . I 'm sorry I came . I just wanted to make sure you were okay . I know how difficult it must have been for you , just walking through that door . But you wouldn 't have come if you didn 't want to . That says something , doesn 't it ? - Scully . - I was just about to leave you a message . I got that address that I wanted you to go to for me . It 's a woman you 're gonna be dealing with . She 's affiliated with American Daoist Healing Center . - She researches crop circles ? - Don 't roll your eyes , Scully . - Mulder . You want me to ... Scully ? Scully , are you there ? Hi . I 'm ... You were ... - At the hospital today . - Right . That 's strange . I 'm Agent Scully . I 'm here on behalf of my partner . - About my research . - For the FBI , as odd as that may sound . - I 'm Colleen Azar . Would you like to come in ? - No , thank you . I 'm ... - I think I need some fresh air . - Are you all right ? Yes , I ... I mean , yes , I ... I 'm just a little shaken . A near car accident , I think . It 's nothing , really . A car accident isn 't nothing . - I 'm sorry ? - In my experience , they 're often the end results of us not paying attention to something . Look , I don 't mean to be rude , but I really don 't have much time . Sure . I 'll go get my papers . You think what we do is a little ridiculous , don 't you ? Uh , to be honest , I don 't exactly know what it is that you do . But you 've already formed a judgment about it . I really should be going . There is a greater intelligence in all things . Accidents , or near accidents , often remind us that we need to keep our mind open ... to the lessons it gives . You may wanna slow down . Hello ? Ah , Hurricane Scully has arrived . - I was summoned . - Would you please tell the doc why he should listen to me . We 've already agreed to doses of digoxin that are far beyond what I normally recommend . I guarantee you , Doctor , you 're doing it right . But I can 't be responsible for treatment that might exacerbate your illness . There hasn 't even been a double-blind analysis of prednisone 's effect . Prednisone ? That won 't complicate cardiac arrhythmia , not if it 's just a short burst . There . An informed opinion . You come off so rational , but maybe you know less than you think . She 's , uh , been through some difficult times . And she 's very angry . How did she even find out ? There are things you don 't know ... things I 'm not proud of . What things ? I screwed up , Dana . Things got bad at home after ... - Bad how ? - I haven 't been completely honest with you . It was hard for me ... when you walked away . I shut down from my family . Needless to say , it was very difficult for Barbara . You divorced . Only after an interminable period of discomfort for us both . Where did you go ? Here . Washington . When ? Almost ten years ago . Daniel , you didn 't move here for me ? I didn 't mean for it to happen this way , of course . Oh , God . You 've come at such a strange time . I know . I know . You ... You have a life . I don 't know what I have . Your X rays were in the wrong envelope . I never would have even known you were here if it wasn 't for a mix-up . It 's just ... What do you want , Dana ? I want everything I should want at this time of my life . Maybe I want a life I didn 't choose . Nurse ! We have a code in here ! Nurse ! Code blue , CCU . Code blue , CCU . He 's in V-fib . Get his head . - In ! - In . - Two hundred joules ! - Two hundred . - All clear ? - Clear . - No pulse , no resps . - Three hundred joules . - Three hundred charge . - Clear ! Clear . - No pulse , no resps . - Epinephrine , one milligram , IV push ! Now ! - Who 's paying attention ? - Ready . - Clear ! - Clear . We have a pulse . Okay . Thank you . Thank you . Hi . Can I help you ? Uh , I 'm looking for Colleen . - You wanna come in ? - I just need to speak with her , that 's all . - I have to go . - Call me if anything interesting happens . - Okay . Bye . - Bye . - I 'm surprised to see you again . - I 'm sorry I was rude before . I 'm a medical doctor and a scientist . And you 're right , I don 't know what it is that you do . But there was something that you said that I wanted to ask you about . About slowing down . Would you like to sit down ? Please . I have a friend who 's ill . And , uh , I had a strange feeling today , just a short while ago , actually , that he may be dying from a more serious condition than anyone realizes . You sense something . Holistic practitioners believe , as do many Eastern religions , that living beings exist beyond the physical dimensions of time and space . That we 're composed of layers of energy and consciousness . You 've probably heard it referred to as an aura . - Mmm , yes . - Witness this energy field ... and truths come out that have little to do with scientific proof ... and much to do with faith . What are you saying that I saw ? Pain . And where there 's pain , there 's a need for healing ... physically , mentally or spiritually . But he has a heart condition . When we hold onto shame and guilt and fear , it creates imbalance . It makes us forget who we are . This is difficult for you to accept . Would you like to have some tea ? Have you ever had moments when everything gets incredibly clear ? When time seems to expand ? Yes . That 's so strange . You may be more open to things than you think . It 's just a matter of what you do with it . I used to be a physicist . I was successful in my field working 80 odd hours a week . I thought I was happy . Truth is I was cut off from the world ... and from myself . I was literally dying inside . I was in a relationship with Carol , who you met , but I was so afraid of what the world and my family ... and my fellow scientists would think that I told no one . Then two years ago , I was diagnosed with breast cancer . - I 'm sorry . - Don 't be . It 's the cancer that got my attention . It stopped me from being on the self-destructive path I was on . It made me realize I was in a field that had little meaning for me ... and it 's what 's allowed me to be happy for what feels like the first time in my life . Huh . But how ? I was introduced to a healer who helped me see the disease for what it was . It wasn 't until I began releasing shame and telling the truth ... that my cancer went into remission . You still aren 't sure . You came here looking for answers and you want something to take back with you . Everything happens for a reason . - Are you happy ? - I 'm sorry . I ... I was just going up to see your father . - You can 't . He 's in a coma . - Since when ? Since about two minutes after you supposedly saved his life . Do you have any idea the hell you 've created in our lives ? Maggie , to be honest , I left so there wouldn 't be hell in your lives . Don 't try to be reasonable with me . I am so sick of being reasonable . You moved on , but we 've had to live with what you left behind . What I try to do is clear the body 's energy channels , what we call chakras , which can become barriers to a doctor 's ability to effectively heal the patient . When these channels are working improperly , whether from poor physical or emotional health , the block serves to create conditions for disease . If I can unblock the energy early on , then I can prevent the onset or escalation of an illness ... What 's going on here ? Dr. Scully , who do you think you are ? We have nothing but Dr. Waterston 's welfare in mind here . - You 're not his doctor . - I understand that . What 's taking place here is an alternative approach . What 's taking place here is a waste of time , Dr. Scully . And I think Dr. Waterston would be the first to agree with me . Have you considered that ? I just wanted to help him . It seemed like nothing else was working . All due respect , that is not for you to assess . That is for me or Dr. Waterston 's family to decide . Then let ' em continue . If it isn 't hurting him , we should at least be open to it . I 'm afraid there 's really nothing more I can do at this time . This man , quite frankly , is ready to move on . But something seems to be holding him back . Unfinished business is binding him to the physical plane . Something he needs to release ... before he can let go . Broken up . Pushing us . Broken up . Pushing us . Hear the rain fall . See the wind come to my eyes . See the storm broken . Now nothing . Speak to me , baby , in the middle of the night . Speak to me . - Hello . - It 's Maggie . - I need you to come to the hospital right away . - Maggie , what 's ... Daniel . You think I 'd give up so easily ? You were slipping away . No one thought you 'd come out of this . - I 'm still in shock . - Imagine my shock ... when the doctor told me the voodoo ritual you 'd arranged for last night . - I was afraid it didn 't work . - Of course it didn 't work . Don 't be absurd . Where 'd you get this crap ? Daniel , that crap may have just saved your life , whether you 're open to it or not . It doesn 't matter . I don 't wanna talk about that . Look at me . I 'm gonna get well . And we need to talk about what happens next for us . I spoke at length to Maggie . It 's time ... that you took responsibility for the hurt you caused in your family . It 's no accident that you got sick , Daniel . You 've been running from the truth for ten years . Dana , it was only to be with you . You were all I lived for . Maybe the reason you 're alive now is to make up for that ... to make it up to Maggie . - That 's Maggie talking , not you . - No . I 'm not the same person , Daniel . I wouldn 't have known that if I hadn 't seen you again . Excuse me ! Hey . - Mulder ? - I was just looking for you . But you 're supposed to be in England . - I 'm back . - What happened ? Nothing . There was no event , no crop circles . - Big waste of time . Maybe sometimes nothing happens for a reason , Mulder . What is that supposed to mean ? Nothing . Come on . I 'll make you some tea . I just find it hard to believe . - What part ? - The part where I go away for two days , your whole life changes . I didn 't say my whole life changed . You speaking to God in a Buddhist temple . God speaking back ? Now , I didn 't say that God spoke back . I said that I had some kind of a vision . Well , for you that 's like saying you 're having David Crosby 's baby . What is it ? I once considered spending my whole life with this man . What I would have missed . I don 't think you can know . I mean , how many different lives would we be leading if we made different choices ? We ... We don 't know . What if there was only one choice ... and all the other ones were wrong ... and there were signs along the way to pay attention to ? Then all the ... choices ... would then lead to this very moment . One wrong turn and ... we wouldn 't be sitting here together . Now , that says a lot . It says a lot , a lot , a lot . I mean , it 's probably more than we should be getting into at this late hour .

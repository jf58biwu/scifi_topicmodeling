 Previously on Farscape . We 're not gonna give up on her , John . I gave you a chance . Where is Crichton ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna need your help , Mr. Scarran half-breed . Aeryn for wormholes . I will help if you taste . I know why she 's reacting like this . Stop . - Do not interfere . She 's with child . Scarran heat probe will kill a pregnant Sebacean . Whose child is inside you ? Is it John Crichton 's ? I don 't know . If this is Crichton 's child , we could learn all he knows about the wormholes from this fetal DNA . Get me out ! Out ! And now , on Farscape . Pilot : The Scarran Border Station has given us permission to dock . Moya senses three other vessels present . One is our own Transport Pod . Well that means Sikozu made it okay . Getting here is the easy part . - She 'll be fine . The Scarrans will just think she 's another Kalish bureaucrat . Yeah , and I 'm supposed to be a Peacekeeper . I love waiting to see how things go south . All vessels en route to Katratzi must stop for inspection and quarantine . The procedure takes five solar days . Any vessel lacking the proper security clearance beacon will be destroyed on sight . That 's very reassuring . We will find her . We 'll get Aeryn back . No matter what . Pilot : Docking completed . Permit station personnel to board , but monitor them . I understand , Captain Wentrask . Chiana : Wentrask ? We must assume that all Comms transmissions are being intercepted . But our Comms are secure . Let 's just pretend they aren 't . Captain Wentrask ? I am Dr. Trayso Talnell , Chief Medical Officer . Yes , yes , yes . Another Kalish functionary . Are these necessary ? Your entire vessel must be checked for contraband and contaminants . We have neither aboard . I should hope not . A , um , Peacekeeper ? You are remarkably perceptive . How do you come to have a Peacekeeper aboard ? What gave you the impression I answer to you ? With due respect , Captain , you will either respond to my inquiries or you will be denied entry into Scarran space . Understood ? The Peacekeeper is a spy for the Scarrans . Also on board we have a Nebari and a Hynerian . They are spies as well . The Hierarchy will not look kindly on a Kalish who obstructs their delivery . Understood ? Do you have anything to eat on board this station ? Refreshments may be obtained in the station commons . Be aware that no weapons are permitted on the station , and ... you will be checked . Our Sentinels are programmed to shoot and kill any armed visitors . Keep an eye on that . ( soft squawk ) All the visitors you get , all the fantastic technology you get to work with ... Chiana : Looks like she 's found a new friend . One of her own kind . Oh . And not too bad looking , at that . Rygel : Sikozu thinks with her head , not her kuzitza . Chiana : Yeah , that 's her problem . Rygel : We were smart to send her ahead . The Kalish are definitely running things around here . Scorpius : They are a conquered species . They serve the Scarrans in order to survive . You mean , they 're collaborators . I 'll bet you could . Diplomatic missions throughout Tormented Space . You must lead an interesting life . Suppose so . I 'm getting tired of the incessant travel , though . I envy you and your stable position here . Running this station isn 't stable . It 's boring . Sikozu : Karohm , your work isn 't boring in the slightest . Karohm : Maybe we should trade jobs . I must get back . Meet me later . Sikozu : In a while . Got anything to tell me ? Aeryn is here . Say that again . Aeryn is here . Where ? - In the Scarran freighter . The Scarran freighter has finished its time in quarantine and it 's leaving in half an arn . This won 't harm the baby , but it will keep you docile . See ? I could make things so much easier for you . If only you 'd trust me . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Chiana : Half an arn ? What can we do in half an arn ? Crichton : We grab our guns and we kick in some doors . Scorpius : We wouldn 't even pass through this station . The Scarran Sentinels are programmed to kill any non-station personnel carrying weapons . We have a hold card . D 'Argo and Noranti are hanging back in Lo 'La . If D 'Argo 's ship attacked a Scarran freighter , a fleet of Scarran warships would instantly be dispatched after us . Besides , the freighter has Aeryn as a hostage . We have a far greater chance here than at any Scarran military base . Hence we need to keep that freighter here long enough to come up with a plan . Pass me all that food . It 's a hell of a time to be eating , Rygel . Rygel : I have an idea . Get me more . Ralnaht : The freighter will be clear to depart within a quarter arn . Time enough for a refreshment . A Scarran Captain with a Charrid sidekick , just like Sikozu said . Jenek : He charged you far too much for that raslek . One of your many weaknesses . Povek neetranko . Povek . May we speak ? Leave us . ( soft menacing growl ) Now , listen carefully . My name is Captain Wentrask . My mission demands absolute secrecy . My proof code is zenark devra zenark prida . ( mirthless chuckle ) Ministry of Dissimulation ? Well , don 't worry , Captain , you have little to fear from me . I have no interest in spies and their intricate games . I am Jenek in command of freighter . You have your mission and I have mine . Scorpius : So , as it should be . ( soft growl ) A half-breed . Of no concern to us . Ready the ship to leave . It 's time . You 're doing good . You 're doing great . ( grunts ) Vreena : Why do you keep on struggling ? You know it won 't do you any good . ( grunting ) Must I keep sedating you ? ( grunting ) Must you keep making things difficult for yourself ? ( crying ) There 's no point in fighting . You know that . ( muffled whimpering ) Crichton : That 's enough . You 're gonna bust a gut . That 's enough , all right . Give me a microt . Sebacean ? ( Rygel gagging ) From the freighter . Sikozu thinks she 's a nurse . Chiana : Not good . It 's another person you 've gotta fool . Rygel : This will be convincing . Stand back . ( retching and moaning ) Hey , you all right ? ( retching and moaning louder ) Don 't feel well . ( retching and burping ) What 's the matter with him ? Maybe it 's your lousy food . Yes , I 'm sure of it . Have you ever had an emesis of this severity before ? Just once , but they cured it . And what was the cause ? A touch of dermaphollica . That 's a highly contagious disease . Oh , don 't worry . They said it was dormant . We 're in lockdown until further notice . Anchor all vessels to their docking ports . No , you can 't keep us here . Uh , I can , and , uh , I must . Uh , under the quarantine policy of your hierarchy . Have you any evidence the Hynerian 's condition poses a risk ? No , but I must err on the side of caution . I am unfamiliar with Hynerian dermaphollica . However , I have asked the medical database at Simstef for information . They 're transmitting it now . I 've also sent out a request for all vessels in the sector for doctors or healers with any knowledge of the disease . That 's not procedure . But , uh , under the circumstances , it 's a very good idea . Thanks for suggesting it . I don 't know why everyone 's afraid of a few germs . Yeah , me neither . This 'll kill them . Mmm , these 'll kill anything . ( laughing ) Greetings . I am Trayso Talnell , Chief Medical Officer . Thank you for coming . Utu Noranti Pralatong , alleviator and healer . And this is my personal assistant . You may remain here if you choose . Yes , healer . A Luxan assistant ? Oh , yes . Luxans make fine pilots , exceptional bodyguards and superlative lovers . ( chuckling ) Data from Simstef . Thank you . - Shhh . ( moaning softly ) Apparently we 've brought you here for nothing , healer . This isn 't dermaphollica at all . Oh , it 's too soon to tell , I 'd say . Uh , per this report , he should have exhibited signs of skin sloughing by now . May I see that ? Yes , well , you see , dermaphollica is very difficult to diagnose . The bacteria that causes the virus is effectively undetectable . Yes , but none of the other symptoms are present . Hence , unless anything else manifests itself in say , ooh , an arn , I can safely lift lockdown . I 'm going to examine the patient . ( Rygel moaning ) And you 're sure that what you had was dermaphollica ? Yes . I barely survived . Four of my wives didn 't . Here . Hmm ? No . Mmm ! Ow ! Swallow . Was that absolutely essential ? Absolutely . Chiana ( softly ) : So tell me . Do you wanna get outta here ? Zepa : Well , it 's getting a bit warm . Maybe we should find some place we can cool down . Get comfortable . Chiana : Gotta suggestion ? ( D 'Argo sighs ) ( softly talking ) What news , healer ? None yet . We 'll just have to wait . Zepa : Maybe you 'd like to go and see my ship . Chiana : Well , is it a very big ship ? Size isn 't as important as speed and maneuverability . Oh , yeah ? That 's what they all say that . Come with me and I 'll prove it . D 'Argo : Excuse me . Hey , Nebari girl . How about I buy you a drink ? Um , I was here first . Your point ? ( sniffs ) ( whispering ) : Much better . Rygel 's scam seems to be working . So you know . One of the voices on the medical distress transmission was Sikozu 's , so we played along . Smart Luxan . It seems your caution was justified . His skin is sloughing . ( groaning softly ) The lockdown will remain in effect . ( groaning ) How contagious is this disease ? It can infect non-Hynerians and those it does infect , it kills without warning . Frell that . I 'm gonna lock myself in an airlock . I 'm afraid it 's far too late for that . And this virus is so pervasive that everyone on this station or any vessels docked to it has already been exposed . So what do we do ? I can attempt to concoct a cure . However , my ship is understocked . I need herbs , medications , healing potions . Do you have you any sort of medical supplies ? I mean , even a simple remedy kit will do . No . No one may board my vessel . Scorpius : I have a facility on board my Leviathan . I offer it for your use . Escort her . Thank you . Crichton : That was a nice job , Granny . You scammed ' em . I couldn 't scam Trayso . But you did . He believes Rygel 's sick . That 's because I made Rygel sick . No , you made him look sick . - No , I made him sick . With what ? Dermaphollica . The virus is dormant in his system . I merely reactivated it . Can you deactivate it ? - I hope so . And what if you can 't ? - He dies . Chiana : Are you tenked ? What are you trying to do , what , kill Rygel ? No . He won 't die . I can make a cure . You sure about that ? I 'm almost certain . How long has Rygel got ? Plenty of time if I 'm not disturbed . Is this bug contagious ? Some varieties can be . Uh-huh . What about this variety ? I 'll fix it . - Well , you 've already fixed it . You 've ... you 've infected us with the frelling Hynerian plague ! Not infected , exposed . Anyway , you can 't get it . I can 't ? Nebari are immune , as are Scarrans . And Sebaceans ? Are Sebaceans immune ? No . You 'll kill Aeryn even before we get a chance to save her ! Don 't you say that ! Don 't you dare say that ! I will fix this ! You wanted a plague , I gave you one . Without real symptoms , the lockdown is lifted , Aeryn is on her way to the Scarran base , and you are frelled . Now I did what I had to . I suggest you do the same . You don 't understand . I have a patient I must protect . Your passenger has already been exposed , as have we all . But the facilities on Katratzi are much more likely to have a cure . Oh , so you 'd expose them as well , would you ? Scarrans are immune to this disease . But Kalish aren 't . I won 't be held responsible for loosing a virus that could prove catastrophic to my own people . Your vessel isn 't leaving , Captain . Karohm : The healer has requested that we allow the patient to be moved aboard the Leviathan . Easier to take tissue samples that way . What ? Release the Hynerian from isolation ? Given the pervasiveness of the virus , isolation is pointless . See to it . What in the frelling yotz were you thinking , you madwoman ? You 're a plague ! A withered , three-eyed , bad-smelling pestilence ! You can shout at me later . I 'll be dead later ! You 'll be dead sooner if I don 't devise a remedy . The more you yell , the more you distract me . ( sniffing ) Noranti 's is the only possible course , John . And what has it bought us ? Time . And what are we doing with that time ? Can 't answer that ? Right . That 's why someone 's gotta get on that freighter . Sikozu was working on it . If she can access schematics of the freighter ... Schematics are not going to give us Aeryn 's location , her condition or tell us how many guards there are . Someone has gotta go in . You can 't possibly believe that Captain Jenek will give you a tour ? Grasshopper ! You aim too high , and Jenek is not the only one with access . Hey . Sebacean . What ? You 're Sebacean , right ? Huh ? Can 't remember the last time I saw a Sebacean woman . It 's gotta be at least half a cycle . So ? So that 's a long time without companionship . I don 't do aliens . Well , I don 't do Peacekeepers , so why waste your time ? What 's that ? This is something for a special friend . It 's the Sebacean cure for Hynerian dermaphollica . Or a vial of dust . You 're a medical worker , right ? I could let you analyze it , but as you say , why waste your time ? Where did you get that ? Sorry , I don 't kiss and tell . But you can be sure you 're not gettin ' it anywhere else . Hynerian dermaphollica rarely infects Sebaceans . When it does , you 're dead before you know it . I hate odds like that . Don 't you ? So , what do you want for it ? I just wanna share . Charrid Guard : No admittance , Peacekeeper . He 's with me . ( door opens ) ( whispers ) : Give me a microt . So this your med bay ? Mm-hmm . Spare bunks . ( metallic clunking ) Fun later . Cure now . It 's a dehydrated concentrate , is it not ? Right . Dilute it ten to one . Saline . There 's enough there for both of us . No more ? No . Why ? Another Sebacean needs treatment . ( softly ) You bastard . Well , it 's too bad for them . ( thud ) ( metallic clinking ) Aeryn . Wake up . ( groaning softly ) Just hold ... hold still . Hol ... hold still . I need to ... I need to unbind these . No . No , it 's me . I 'm real . Aeryn . ( whimpering ) Shh ! Shh ! ( whimpering ) Shh ... Leave her alone . Crichton : Don 't do anything stupid . Scarran Hierarchy paid good crindars for me . They wouldn 't want the package delivered damaged . ( grunts ) ( screaming ) Vreena : He claimed it was a cure for Hynerian dermaphollica . But was it genuine ? No , it 's a fake . Why the deception ? 'Cause ... horny . Umm ... Just lookin ' for a Sebacean woman . Vreena : You attacked me and attempted to release one of the patients . Hey , no offense , but she 's sexier than you are . Jenek : What would you have done had you gotten her ? Taken her back to my ship ... frelled her ... made babies . ( hissing ) Jenek , what are you doing with my Peacekeeper ? Jenek : Your Peacekeeper was aboard my ship attempting to recreate . Is that true ? Yeah . More or less . If you 'll excuse us , I will deal with him . ( low growl ) I said , I will deal with him . ( growling ) Aah , that 's a hell of a thing . ( groaning ) John , how did you lie to Jenek 's heat probe ? Was it Katoya 's training ? Ha ! Nah , I told him the truth . Just not the whole truth . ( grunts ) Aeryn 's in there . We gotta get her out . Sikozu is gathering information which will help us put together a rescue plan . We will free Officer Sun . ( grunting ) ( groaning ) The Rosrob Center sent us all their data on dermaphollica , but it isn 't much . And I still can 't get a response from the Diagnosans on Coldjen . ( slaps the panel ) Frell ! Why don 't you take a rest interval ? I can monitor communications for you . This will boost your Hynerian antibodies and cleanse you of the disease . Open . ( gulping ) Unfortunately , it won 't cure anyone other than a Hynerian . And that 's a problem ? I mean , uh , has anyone else contracted the sickness ? No , not as yet . Oh . And they may not . But there 's always a chance . Mm-mm ... ( gasping ) Rygel ? Rygel ! Hey . Hey , you with the big ship . ( muffled choking ) ( coughing ) Hey , you okay ? We may have another victim . Come on . Chiana : Somebody ? Somebody call the healer . ( screaming ) - Hey , what are you doing ? Don 't run away ! Get ... ( choking ) - It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's okay . We 're ... we 're gonna get the healer . ( choking ) Dermaphollica has proven fatal to a Kalish traveler . Captain Jenek requests your presence aboard his vessel . No , no , no , no . I must find this remedy . He may come here if he chooses . No , he wants you to go to him . The healer needs more resources than are available to make a cure . If there 's anything aboard your vessel that would assist ... You must realize we have a common problem . We both have cargo that needs protecting . I 'll solve my own problems . Sikozu : The Scarran freighter is not only docked to the station , but it is tied to its power grid as well . From station control , I can force a power surge that will disrupt the circuits of both the station and the freighter . That 'll knock out the lights , the alarms and those ugly Scarran DRDs . For how long ? Only until emergency overrides activate . Maybe 30 microts . Okay . Once we rescue Aeryn , we 've gotta get Moya off that station . Yes , I think I 've worked out how to bypass the docking locks . You think ? What were you doing with Karohm all this time ? What about the window stickers this joint 's supposed to give out ? Security beacons . We 'll need some . If we rescue Aeryn ... Don 't say " if . " I 'm sorry . Yes . When we rescue Aeryn , we simply Starburst away from Scarran space ... What if we Starburst deeper into Scarran space ? Or if the freighter takes off with Aeryn . If the freighter escapes , then we abandon all hope ... We abandon all hope of leading long and prosperous lives , and we follow the freighter . ( sighs ) She 's still learning . Noranti : You don 't have to use force . I want to find a cure as much as you do . You will find a cure , and we will have it first . Nurse , assist them . Nurse , didn 't you ... ( growling exhale ) Check the patient . Noranti : I 'll do it . ( groaning ) - Save your strength . Don 't try to speak . She doesn 't appear to be infected . Well , neither was my nurse . If she 's infected , can you cure her ? I think I can , given time . Jenek : The female is pregnant . Her fetus must be saved . Is there a suitable recipient for transplant ? What ? No ! Anyway , it wouldn 't do any good . All the females here are equally at risk from this disease . What about the Nebari girl ? Nebari are immune . Go to the Leviathan and bring back the Nebari . We can 't take our weapons through the station . Then take a Transport Pod and board from the outside . ( Aeryn moaning ) Noranti : Hush , now . Hush . ( growling ) - Hey . Get out of my way , fek-face . Hey , let me go . ( grunts ) ( screaming ) ( grunting ) Get her . Get up ! Guard the door . Yah ! ( screaming ) Get your frelling hands off me ! They took Chiana by force , and you just let them ? ! I was unaware until it was too late to prevent it . Recriminations can wait . We must act . Are you ready ? ( frantic panting ) As the doctor said , save your strength . Oh ... can 't let them do this . It won 't happen . I won 't let it happen . They can 't do it without Chiana and they won 't find her . ( Chiana screaming ) Bring her . Prepare for the procedure . What the frell 's going on ? I 'll sedate her . - No ! No ! Stop ! Stop ! This is wrong . This patient has been drugged . She is weak . She may die from this procedure . I don 't care . My only concern is for the safety of the fetus . Trayso . Please . Please . Proceed . Hold still . ( Aeryn groaning ) ( screaming ) What are you giving her ? Something to ease the pain . She doesn 't needs anaesthetizing . Give it to the Nebari girl instead . No , I won 't . This is the patient who needs anethes ... You 're not going to cut ... Oh , oh ! Chiana : Get that thing frelling away from me ! ( spits ) Very strong . She 'll make an excellent host . She had better . If the fetus dies , so will the both of you . ( gulps ) Karohm : Captain Jenek . Captain Wentrask is in the station commons . He demands an urgent word , sir . Does he ? Very well . Ralnaht ? Jenek : What do you want , Wentrask ? I require your cooperation . But you can 't compel it . Jenek , I know that your prisoner is the Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun and that you are taking her to Katratzi for Minister Ahkna . I also know that if my mission fails , your mission becomes irrelevant , as do you . Continue . Karohm ? ( monitors beep slowly ) ( panel beeping ) Step back . I ... was just checking to see if more medica ... Someone 's been downloading the station codes and schematics . It had to be you . But I 'm disappointed . You know this can 't succeed . We 'll kill them both and the fetus as well . No choice but to try . What the hell is taking so long ? The lights should be out by now . The procedure 's success depends upon the swift transfer of the fetus . Therefore , we should open both the subjects simultaneously . I 'll go check it out . Right . Listen to me , Karohm . Two , possibly three , females are being held against their will on the Scarran freighter . Halt . Prepare to begin . They pose the Scarrans no threat . Their imprisonment is completely unjust . I believe you . Then will you help me ? Of course not . I 'm gonna lock you up . ( hisses ) How wrong was he ? Okay , now can you do what you said you were gonna do ? Dr. Trayso , in my opinion , this patient 's body is overstressed . Therefore , the fetus will be debilitated . I think we should let her regain her equilibrium before we begin the procedure . - We don 't have time . What you fail to realize is that Ahkna 's only interest in your prisoner is as a means to the possible information that John Crichton possesses . Now my Peacekeeper defector can give you John Crichton himself . Now , which mission do you think is more vital ? ( monitor beeps ) All right . That 's unlocked the docking ports on Moya , on your ship and my Transport Pod . Now for the power grid . Ah ! Are these the security beacons ? Yes . ( engine roars ) There are three lives here , and I will not be responsible for the loss of three lives ! - Doctor Pralatong , I beg you . Showtime . ( groaning ) ( alerts in various alien languages ) Karohm , what 's going on ? Stand here . Oh ! Stop ! I 'll kill her . I 'll cut her throat . Noranti : He wouldn 't dare . If the baby dies , Jenek 'll burn him dead , so shoot ! I 'll do it . I 'll kill her . Kalish are supposed to be smart . Who do you think I believe ? All right . Shoot me . ( screams ) You should 've killed him . My body count 's already too high . Noranti : The release is over here . Ready ? Do it . ( groans ) Check the ship . - Yes , I must check mine . No . You stay here . ( alerts in various alien languages ) ( growls ) Are you done ? Almost . If I jam the docking docking port controls then the freighter won 't be able to break free and follow us . ( gasping ) How 'd you do that ? It was nothing . I ... I merely cross-coupled the emergency bypass conduits . Let 's go . Quickly ! Emergency power will come on any microt ! Stop ! Drop the weapon . Turn off that light . Granny , do what he says . Back to our vessel . You work for the Scarran , right ? Yes . Why ? Security is tight for visitors , so you shouldn 't be carrying . Carrying what ? ( groans ) A gun . D 'Argo , please ! Please help her . Ralnaht . Report . ( growling ) ( growls ) Chiana : I 'm fine . You can put me down , at least for now . Pilot , what 's our status ? Moya is free of the docking collar . Reactivate all Starburst systems . Done . ( grunting ) Who are you and what is your mission ? ( groans ) Sikozu : Pilot , any communication from Scorpius ? No . Nor is he responding to the Comms . Lo 'La and our Transport Pod have also been released from their ports . Okay , well bring them aboard with the Docking Web . What about Scorpius ? - What about him ? Well he might 've been captured . - Or killed . We can only wish . Pilot , Starburst as soon as you can . Oh , no , no , no , no . - We are leaving . Pilot : Preparing for Starburst . Why doesn 't she ever listen ? ( shudders ) It 's ... it 's all right . Aeryn , it 's all right . You 're here . Is this real ? It 's real . You 're on Moya . You 're safe . What about the baby ? The baby 's fine . Everything 's gonna be okay . Sleep . Stay . You don 't look as bad . I 'm fine , thanks for asking . You nearly killed me . No , I didn 't . Oh . But I did kill others . By my actions , I have taken innocent lives . Welcome to Moya . In my time as Dominar , some of my actions resulted in the deaths of the undeserving . Even when the cause is just , it 's a hard thing to accept . I must seek forgiveness ... Mmm from the Divine Eternal . I can 't help you there . But I can extend my forgiveness . No ! ( organ music plays ) ( coffin creaking ) Harvey ? You 're not dead . Of course I 'm not dead . ( laughs ) : I am the ... undead . That 's not funny . That son of a bitch said he took you out of my head . ( in Transylvanian accent ) Scorpius , he upgraded me to Harvey 2.0 . One of my many improvements : utter loyalty to Scorpius . That 's not an improvement . - Oh , but it is . His course is the correct . Why ? Eliminate Scarran threat . You know I don 't give a damn about his agenda . You must go back for him . Go back to sleep before I drive a stake through your heart . ( muffled ) : He knows everything you know , John ! What did you say ? I said " Scorpius knows everything you know , John . " What ... did you say ? ! I said " Scorpius knows everything you know . " Meaning what ? Another new feature . Scorpius can hear me . Well , I 've been sharing the contents of your head with him . Memories , thoughts , dreams . Wormhole technology . No , you 're lying . And eventually , they will torture the information out of him , and everything they ever wanted to know about wormholes will be theirs , courtesy of John Crichton . Leave me alone ! No ! Hey ... hey ... It 's all right . Harvey : You have to go back for Scorpius ! Tell her , John . Tell her ! You must rescue Scorpius . Tell her !

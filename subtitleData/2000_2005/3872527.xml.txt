 Come on , get the net . Hurry . I want the child . Incredible . What are you waiting for . Get her ! Go ! Run ! Run ! Get up ! Forget the Neanderthal ! I want the jungle princess . Go ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out of the Lost World Veronica ! Three men with guns headed this way . Yes so we heard . What happened ? Are you all right ? They 're killers . They were hunting Trogs then they came after me . - They shot at you ? - No with a net . They 're headed this way ? Stay here , I 'll grab the guns . We 'll give them a real warm welcome . Professor Challenger I presume . You have me at a disadvantage sir . Avery Burton ... commissioned by an international consortium of ... concerned parties to find you and the members of your lost expedition . Apparently lost no longer . Lord Roxton . At your service . As I am yours . Your exploits are legendary . I can 't tell you what an honor it is to finally meet you sir . I knew we hadn 't been abandoned . Not by a long shot I can assure you sir ... though you 're a tough man to follow , eh boys ? That 's the truth sir . Now that I 've found you Professor we 're not going to let you out of our sight . Not until we get you back to London . Get ready , someone 's coming . Challenger ! Roxton ! Who 's that with you ? Avery Burton , Mr. Malone . What the hell 's the matter Malone ? What do you want from us Mr. Burton ? Come to take you all home . - I don 't believe it . - How , in a net ? There 's only one way to find out . We 'll be right down . Did you hear anything I just said ? So do you really know a way out of here ? I know the way we got here . Will that do Miss Krux ? That will do admirably , admirably . How did you find us Mr. Burton ? Ned Malone , always the reporter . I so admired your stories from the front . Especially Flanders , I don 't know how you survived . Well you develop an instinct for danger . And not even two years in the jungle ... can dim your beauty Miss Krux . - I 'd heard ... - You 're too kind Mr. Burton . Please call me Marguerite . Avery , I 'd be honored . How exactly did you find us ? Who , what , where , when , why , how ? That 's what makes you who you are . I followed the itinerary that Challenger left ... until I reached a dead end . I searched for several weeks trying to find a clue or a trace of your party . I was ready to turn back ... and then I discovered a volcanic fissure ... and I acted out a hunch . See ... I 've got instincts too . A volcanic fissure . Carved out by some ancient lava flow I suspect . Sounds good enough to me . So , how soon can we leave ? I don 't know why you 'd want to leave here ? You seem pretty well set up to me . Yes we live here with a young lady . I believe you 've already met her . You tried to capture her with a net . Veronica ? No , my God I. she 's a friend of yours ? I 'm terribly sorry I thought she was a savage . Far from it . I should think you owe her an explanation . Or at least an apology . Yeah , of course . I had no idea . It 's the least I can do . Veronica ? I 'd like you to meet Avery Burton . We 've already met . I 'm so sorry . I don 't know where to begin . I truly had no idea . Why were you chasing down a mother Trog and her child ? I was hoping to capture one of those unique apes ... - and take them back to civilization . - Just like that ? Just rip it from its home and take it with you ? Well , the world has never seen such a creature . And what about me ? Were you going to put me on display too ? That was a most unfortunate mistake . Unfortunate ... because I got away or because these are my friends ? Veronica , we 've all killed trogs . In self defense yes . This one wasn 't even full grown . Mr. Burton is an explorer , he 's ... expected to collect specimens . I think he deserves a second chance . Just because he knows the way out of here . If he 's going to stay he can sleep somewhere else . That 's alright I understand ... and I apologize once again . I want him gone by the time I get back to the treehouse . Well I guess you can 't make everybody happy . I feel terrible about Veronica . I think I 've been reading too much Edgar Rice Burroughs . She surprised us too the first time we saw her . She 's like nothing I 've ever seen , that 's for sure . Yep ! she survived for ten years on her own ... after her parents disappeared ... Incredible . You still planning on taking a Troglodyte back to civilization ? I 'd like to , yes . I think the whole world deserves a look at that stunning ape . As long as it 's treated humanely . It goes without saying . That 's all right , I 'll take that . You know I have this ... strangest feeling that we 've met somewhere before , New York perhaps ? Last time I was in the States you were just a schoolgirl . - Cairo then ? - Nope . - Rome ? - Nope . - Johannesburg ? - So ... has this expedition been all you hoped for ? What do you mean ? Everyone 's here for a reason , Challenger , Roxton , Malone . Burton ? Best one of all , to take you home . And not a moment too soon . Surely Marguerite Krux didn 't finance ... this expedition as an act of charity ? Well , sometimes Mr. Burton you have to know when to cut your losses . That 's a shame . Are you mad at Burton for what he tried to do to you ... or us because we 're leaving ? Are you going to let him drag a Trog back to London ... to be put on display ? I 'll be there to make sure it 's treated properly . Forever ? Why don 't you come with us ? Just for a visit , you could always come back . I wouldn 't go anywhere with Burton . Are you sure you 've got him right ? I mean all he 's done since he 's got here is apologize for what he did . He might fool you but he 's not fooling me . Come on . He made a mistake . He would have done anything to bag his trophy . That is exactly what he planned to do with me . But not any more . As long as he promises to get you out of here ... I guess that 's all that matters . - This is the big one . - Really ? We 're going to be rich . What about all that cargo all these people have to carry ? Their cargo won 't be a problem . When we leave here we 're gonna be traveling very light . A few precious stones , a few knickknacks to prove we ran into the ... ill fated Challenger expedition . and one special trophy . A caveman . The jungle girl . - I can 't find him anywhere . - No sign of him at the river . You 're sure he didn 't say anything last night ? We talked about Burton . I don 't know where he went after that . Lovely morning . Have you seen Malone ? This morning ? Is he missing ? His bed hasn 't been slept in . And he did not tell anyone he planned to be gone . I take it this is not like him . Not at all . I 've checked all his usual haunts . There 's no sign of him anywhere . If you want a hand looking for him I can send my men over . Well , the sooner we get started the better . You think I 'm crazy too . Well crazy to stay here when you could ... come back to London with us , but that 's another story . I know Burton has something to do with this . You might be right . Do you know something about him ? For now let 's just call it woman 's intuition . He certainly seems to have the men hooked . You go look for Malone . I 'll stay here and sniff around . If he shows up I 'll send a signal . Thanks Applegate ? Beg your pardon ? You know with a mustache and blonde hair you would ... bear a striking resemblance to Randolph Applegate . Sorry , the name doesn 't ring a bell . Notorious trophy hunter ? You 're in the same line of work . Sorry . You found the lost Panovski expedition . Unfortunately by the time he got to them they were all dead . - These things happen . - Yes they do . It was in all the papers . Somehow Randolph Applegate just walked out of the Congo ... with the treasure Panovski had been looking for . Lucky guy . Yeah , to say the least . Of course the British society investigated him . - But found nothing . - So you do know him . It was in the papers . You see ... Panovski wasn 't the only one who discovered treasure . Heh ! Very nice . I just wanted to be sure who I was dealing with . Get me off this plateau ... and I will provide you with all the diamonds that you can carry . You interested ? It depends . Who am I dealing with ? You 're dealing with me , exclusively . In that case I 'm going to need more than your word ... that these diamonds actually exist . You see , there was a Miss Smith in Cairo , 1916 . I 've always heard Cairo was a very nasty town . Especially in summer . I 'll get you all the proof you need . - No hard feelings , I hope ? - No . We have been searching for six hours . If we want to get back to camp before nightfall ... - we should at least ... - I know , we better head back now . We 'll start again tomorrow at first light . Maybe we 'll find him on the way home . Everything 's changed since they got here . You can 't blame them for this . They did risk their lives to find us . Well I don 't trust them , any of them . Why would they wish us any harm ? Come on , we 're all a bit tired . Let 's get back and get some rest . We 'll find him . I promise , don 't worry . That jungle girl , she 's trouble . - She 's got the others thinking . - Forget it . Soon it won 't matter what any of them thinks . How 's the accommodation ? Not too cramped I hope ? Applegate ? Hurry . I 'd rather not been seen talking alone to you . Why , are you worried your friends might start ... wondering who you really are ? This buys me a first class ticket out of here , right ? This ? What is this ? It 's a map to a cave where you 'll find the diamonds I promised you . We have a deal ? If the map pans out , yeah we do . It will . Then why don 't you go and finish packing . We dispose of the two other men in the morning . Mr. Roxton ! Professor Challenger ! - You found him ? - Yeah he 's in a cave not far from here . Malone 's . - How badly injured is he ? - Come on , we have to hurry . You didn 't go with the men ? Roxton and Challenger can handle it . They 'll bring him back ... if Malone 's really out there . You don 't think he is ? I 'm going to do a little investigating closer to home . I want to find out more about Mr. Burton . I 'm not so sure that you want to . Mr. Burton is a very dangerous man . - Where is he ? - Leave your weapons . - What is this ? - Drop ' em ! I said drop ' em . Woo-hoo lovely piece of work . Empty your pockets . I demand an explanation . I said empty your pockets . What have you done with Malone ? Let 's just say ... he 's indisposed . To Professor George Challenger , the London Zoological Society . This will do nicely . You brought us here to rob us ? No , these are just mementos ... proof that we actually found you . So now you don 't have to take us back with you , is that your game ? Very good Lord Roxton , first try . You all die on some glorious adventure ... and I bring back whatever I can find . Now , into the cave . I said move . Any bright ideas ? Look out ! Nice try Marguerite . Why the hell would Burton go to all this trouble ? Why not just shoot us ? This wasn 't Burton 's idea . I think it was Marguerite 's . - Why would she want to trap us ? - Not us . I 'll wager she was trying to trap Burton but he outsmarted her . Now all we need is the jungle girl and we can get out of here , right ? We need the diamonds but I 'll take care of that . You just find the girl . Okay , all right . Avery . Did you really think I 'd fall for your little plan ? - I thought you were . - Don 't worry ... if the blast didn 't kill your friends ... they 'll run out of air in a day or two . What are you talking about ? The map , the mine . and the little blast you set up to kill me . Beautiful ! And you 'd make a deal with my men to lead you out of here . I bet all those rumors are true . Now it 's my turn to play games . What do you want from me ? Everything you got , starting with the diamonds . Show me all your secret hiding places . Obviously I 've misjudged you . Obviously . Dear Lord , let us not forget these . Those ? I was getting to those . Where 's the rest ? If you 're going to kill me why should I tell you ? I 'll find them anyway . Malone ? Ned ? Ned ? Now I just need something from your little reporter friend . How is Malone ? A little annoyed the last time I looked . Ah , I like it when people put their names on things . Are you sure I have nothing else that you want ? Why don 't we continue our discussion ... back at my place ? Anywhere you like . - Do you see anything yet ? - Nothing . Challenger ! You all right ? Challenger ? Say something ! Challenger ! Marguerite , are you here ? Roxton ? Lots of diamonds . Where is she ? Gone . We couldn 't find her . So hard to get good help these days . Sit down . You know , you and I could keep each other honest . Why do I feel you don 't care that I 'm the one who 's holding the gun ? For now . You never stop do you ? I can 't . can you ? I 'll finish this later . You come with me . Right now I 've got one more trophy to collect . If she opens her mouth shoot her . Help ! Help Me ! - Malone ! - Roxton . Malone ! Damn her . Where did she go ? Ned , Malone can you hear me ? All right Veronica that was a cute trick ... but enough 's enough . Come on out . If I do , it will only be to kill you . He 'll be dead before I am . Come on Veronica now I 'm bored . All right . Come on . That 's it . Drop your weapons . all of them . Sorry Malone . I knew you couldn 't stand to see him get hurt . Hell , you wouldn 't even let us net a Trog . You slimy bastard . They 're going to love you all over Europe . Challenger ! Challenger ! Come on ! Now Breathe . Breathe . Come on ! I thought I lost you , old boy . We 're almost there . We 're almost there . Let 's get on with it . Any last words for your friends ? Oh my God . Now it 's time for you . Take me with you . You begging me ? Veronica ! - You think I 'd let her get away ? - Let her go . It seems I have two beautiful women at my disposal ... one who wants me and one who doesn 't . Take us both , see how far you get . See , I always prefer the ones who play hard to get . Gentlemen help Miss Smith ... to her first class accommodations . No ! Let me go ! Avery what are you doing ? I 'm so sorry Marguerite , but you 're just too much trouble . I could die down there . Probably , but you might get lucky . Time for the road . You 'll never get away with this . Given my track record I 'd ... say I have a better than even chance , wouldn 't you ? I 'll fight you every step . I wouldn 't have it any other way . Malone . Malone . wake up . wake up . Damn it . We 're through , Challenger ! We made it ! Hello , anybody out there ? Help , we 're in here . Marguerite ? Oh . Help ! - What is it ? - Help ! I certainly hope I 'm not interrupting anything ? All right , all right I 'm sorry . Give me a hand , will you ? Oww Now just to clear the air . You didn 't have any selfish personal motives for not telling us whatever it is you know about Mr. Burton , did you ? No , and his real name 's not Burton . Whatever it is , what were you supposed to get out of the deal ? Why does there have to be a deal ? I sent him out there to get rid of him , obviously . - Why not just let us help you ? - Because there wasn 't time . I thought I could handle him myself . He left here with Veronica an hour ago . Now if we don 't stop him we can kiss her goodbye ... and any chance we have of getting off this damn plateau . Next time remember who your friends are . I 've read about creeps like you ... who make their money off other people 's misery . Yeah , it 's a cruel world . You can leave anytime you want . I 'll even help give you a push . You 're going to pack them in all over Europe . You 're going to be my jungle princess . You better hope you live that long . My savage jungle princess . Come on . That must be them ... looks like they 're headed for the pine forest . - Do you want to rest for a moment ? - No , can 't stop . Now what did you learn from Burton ? He 's a trophy hunter . His name 's Applegate . You might have heard of him . Applegate , the Panovski affair ? When did you figure this out ? Just before I rigged the cave . - Why didn 't you tell us ? - Why , would it 've changed anything ? Veronica tried to warn us but we didn 't listen . Let 's face it , we were so anxious to get off ... the plateau and cash in our chips ... that we were all willing to make a deal with the devil . And now Veronica is paying the price . Hey ... hey ... hey . Now what 's the problem ? Listen , why don 't we just leave her here and get ... the diamonds . It 'll be a lot easier . Steve , you know the good things in life are never ever easy . Come on we 're only a few hundred yards from the fissure . See if you can drag her highness along . Let 's go . What the hell was that ? Look ! Impossible , I should have killed them when I had the chance . Keep them pinned down ! Split up , come at them from two sides . Don 't fire unless you 're certain of a clean shot . That 's exactly what I intend to do . Let 's go ! They 're trying to skirt around us . They 're going to be too late . You hold them off while I get things ready . What ? So where have you run into this character before ? Oh we traveled in the same circles . If we ever get out of here I 'll tell you the whole story . Any sign of Veronica ? No . Are you planning on double crossing Steve too ? Hey ! Timing ... timing . Well it looks like she won 't stay away . He was going to leave you here or kill you . What ? Who are you going to believe , eh ? Johnson ! Stop her ! Let 's just leave ! Wrong answer . So this is the way off the plateau ? So what are we waiting for ? Marguerite , no ! Marguerite ! Stop ! Burton 's going to blow the fissure any second . - Then we 'll never get out of here . - No . Forget it Marguerite , it 's not worth it . Wait ! Do you want to destroy our only way off the plateau ? Are you out of your mind , it 's a bloody grenade ! No ! Move it ! Go ! There goes another way back home . Do you think Burton made it out ? Do you think he 'll tell anyone about us even if he did ? Not a chance . I guess you 're all still stuck here with me . Challenger I think this belongs to you . That 's amazing , it 's still working . Ah , and my journals . That 's a relief . Thanks to that expert shot of mine I didn 't lose my rifle . That was my expert shot . Don 't tell me . There 's no sign of my gems . There 's no sign of your gems . Sorry Marguerite , the rest just seems to be dirty socks and underwear . I guess you could consider that some sort of trophy . I prefer this , his prized possession . You don 't seem to be too put out by what you lost ? A few diamonds ? I hid the best ones where he would never find them . Very clever , Miss Smith . You know , I think we 'd all like to know what really did happen in Cairo . Miss Smith ? Isn 't that what he called you in his tent ? When were you in Cairo ? What was it that Burton said while we were walking ? Well come on , you said you 'd tell us the whole story . Don 't you think people are more interesting ... when they have secrets ? No ! *

How dare you bring a Men-Tel executive into our home . - Former . Please . - Stanley 's a sympathizer . He 's carrying the plans for Men-Tel 's new power station . We 've got to get him to resistance H.Q Have you lost your mind coming here ? You know Men-Tel is still looking for us . They even want Danny . I know that , but they 're vulnerable now . Their oil is drying up , their coal will be gone soon ... and without their power station , Men-Tel has no power . Look , John ... I know you 've done more for the resistance than anyone could ask ... but we need your help again . Taking out that power plant would be a big win for us . What are you talking about ? You can 't win . They control everything and everyone . I told you this was a waste of time . Let 's get outta here . - You have no right to even be here . - No ? How long do you think it will be before they find you here ? There where are you gonna hide ? It 'll be dark soon . May be you should go . - You said we were done with the boat . - Just get in . I 'd feel a whole lot better if you were coming with us , John . Yeah , me too . How well do you know that woman ? We fought together in Mexico . What if she 's right ? What if Men-Tel finds us here ? We 'll move again . I don 't want Danny to spend his whole life running . Come on . Come on , Danny ! Let 's go ! Go , go ! Clear ! - You got it ? - Yeah . Clear ! - What are you doing ? - I 've gotta hold them off . Open the grate ! - I 'm not leaving without you . - I love you , Danny . - Your mom will take care ofyou . - You 're supposed to ! I can 't see ! Don 't do this . I lost you once . I won 't let it happen again . Go , go ! - Any sign of them ? - It 's an old waterworks . Booby-trapped . Blue Leader , this is Eagle One .

Take a bedroll and move out . Are you out of your mind , bringing Brennick there ? Susan . How nice to hear from you after all this time . Daddy all right ? Fuck Daddy . Why on Earth would you wanna bring the only man ever to escape ... from a Men-Tel prison to my power station ? Is that what we 're calling it these days ? Listen carefully . If it hadn 't been for your father and me ... Brennick 's escape would have cost you your career . If any thing goes wrong this time ... it won 't just beyour job ; it 'll be your ass . The new prisoners ... have completed their orientation , Mr. Teller . Laborers , ZED . Laborers . Next think you know , they 'll want a fucking union . I 'm Dr. Preminger , and this is the Men-Tel Prison Network . All right , everybody , step out . - Where to ? - They 're all the same.Just pick one .

How 're we gonna get outta here ? " We " ? Just like Mama used to make . Are we supposed to eat this shit ? That 's my food , bitch ! Damn ! Everyone , back in your seats ! There 's a disturbance in the commissary . Shall I institute behavior modification ? ZED , I 'm dining . Unauthorized physical contact is a violation .

Give her a little more juice . A screw 's a screw , fish . You just messed up , bad . Thanks . He played knick-knack on my shoe With a whack-whack ZED , have Brennick brought up here . Unauthorized access is a violation . Guess you 've done this before . Kill the pain zone , ZED . 609 . Prisoner 27609 , authorized . Thank you , Mr. Sato . Wait outside , please . Who are you ? My name is Teller . I 'm the administrator of this godforsaken institution . Ten years ago , I ran all of Men-Tel 's prison facilities ... including The Fortress . - Until you destroyed it . - I 'm so sorry . You will be ... once I get them here . I beat you , Dad . - You son of a bitch ! - Unauthorized contact is a violation . Thank you , ZED . You 're welcome . As you instructed ... order has been restored in the commissary ... and the new prisoners have been returned to their cells ... to await your welcoming address . Good evening . For those of you who 've just arrived , welcome . Let me explain a few simple rules . Numberone . Pursuant to a charter between your governments and Men-Tel Corporation ... your death sentences have been stayed for as long as 'l see fit . Plan accordingly . Rule number two . Physical contact with members of staff ... is strictly forbidden . Anyone violating this rule will be asked to leave . Oh , my God . What the hell 's that ? We 're in space . This is some real bullshit . Rule number three . You are 26,000 miles from the nearest bus station ... surrounded by an airless , irradiated vacuum . While there may be those amongst you who think otherwise ... there can be no escape . Thought to the contrary will be discouraged . Thank you and good night . Welcome home . - Good morning . - Delete 225 , ZED . Prisoner number 225 . Ho , Sally . File deleted . One down , 119 to go , eh , Gordo ? I gotta tell you . I don 't think that 's funny . - Did you see the way she died ? - Who gives a shit ? He put her through the chemical disposal unit , for Christ 's sake ! Another scumbag gets what 's coming to him . Or in this case , her . I think . Nobody deserves to go out like that . You 're breaking my heart . Now go wake them up . Anda-one , anda-two , anda-three . Now keep it up . Strenuous exercise program ... will help combat the effect of our artificial gravity . Stretch and flex . Stretch and flex . Feel the burn . Once more . You gotta be kidding ! All right . Rise and shine , you shitheads ! We 're gonna have some fun today . Line up when you hear your name . - Mr. Gordon ? - Rivera , E. Marks , P. Martinez , C. Unit One . Going that way . Polk , M. Wells , H. Taz , M. Brennick , J.Jackson , M. Unit Two . You 're in the elevator . The rest of you go with Mr. Parker . Thought I recognized you . We were in the joint together . Think you can get out of this one , hotshot ? - What 's that all about ? - I don 't know . I guess I have one of those faces . Can you free that tightening already ? Now this is difficult , so pay attention . You cut this up , and you put it in there . You got it ? Not you . The four of you follow me . - Where we go ? - Field trip . Just for the record , I ain 't the least bit happy about this . I 'll make a note ofit . No safety lines , guys . Stay close to something you can grab . Man , these people don 't know what kind of asses they 're putting their risks in . Okay , just take it easy this time . That 's right . That 's right . Now just a little bit to the right . Yo , Brennick ! Waitup ! Easy . - What was that ? - Stay with us , Marcus . - Better take it easy on those bolts . - Why ? You the bolt police ? They 're packed with explosives . It 'll blow your handoff . Look ! - Kiss my ass . - One fragment ... could shatter you helmet or puncture your suit . You 'd last a minute out here , tops . What that guy said about you this morning . About you escaping . Is it true ? Not any more . But you could do it again , right ? Have we killed anybody since I left ? You know ... I 've been wondering about you . What are you doing up here , anyway ? Man 's got to make a living . This ain 't a living , pal . It 's a life . You 're either one of us , or you 're one of them . So you better figure out which is which before someone else does it for you . What is this ? Is this a threat ? Second warning . Meteor shower approaching . Asshole . We 've got four prisoners out there . It 's not like we 're gonna run out . Let 's get out there ! Prisoners must return to the station immediately . This is the second warning . - Did you ignore the first one ? - Forget about it . It 's just a shower . Warning .. All exterior personnel ... must proceed to the nearest airlock immediately . Any personnel remaining outside the station ... will be subject to projectile injuries above survivable levels . - Help me ! - Let 's go ! Warning ! Warning ! All exterior hatches ... will be automatically sealed in 30 seconds . - Let 's go , man ! - Preparing for lockdown . Come on , come on . Warning .. All air locks will be sealed in 15 seconds . Meteor fragments have now reached the perimeter . Fatal meteorite densities are imminent . This is the final warning . There are now ten seconds until lockdown . Proceed to the nearest airlock immediately . Stand clear of all airlock doors . Locking mechanisms have now been activated . Stand clear of all airlock doors . - Open the door ! - Mac Dan 's still out there ! - Open the door ! - We can 't lt 's sealed ! Open goddamned the door ! What the fuck ? I give that one a 9.5 . What about you , Gordo ? This some real bullshit . Be back in five . Keep it moving . Let 's go . Hook ' em up . Get it to the scanner . There 's still two loads to go . She 's a beauty , ain 't she ? - She yours ? - I wish . Got my old tug parked out by the back door . Challenger-class piece of shit . I flew a Challenger in the air corps . - Yeah ? What squad ? - 37th . Double deuce myself . - J . Hickey . - John Brennick . Nice to meet ya . So , you miss it ? The air corps ? - Beats this . - I guess . Gotta be better than what I 'm doing . Fucking iceman . - " Iceman " ? - Fly to the moon , pick up the ice ... melt it on the way here and dump it in the tank . Shit , shower and shave , and do it all over again . You don 't go to Earth ? My old wreck ? It 'd be a one-way fuckin ' trip . Move your asses . - Good talking to you . - Back at you , pal . How well do you know that pilot ? I just met him . What were you talking about ? Nothing much . Boy talk . Yeah . What about the cameras in the lab ? And the latch on the container ? You 're imagining things . That 's mine . That 's mine too . - Nobody likes a smart guy . - You must be very popular . - You disrespecting me , punk ? - I 'm not looking for any trouble . Found you , anyway . Warning .. Unauthorized physical contact is a violation . Behavior modification will commence in five seconds . Suspended . You fuckin ' broke my rib ! You broke my nose ! - Are you all right ? - I 'm okay . Let me see . You may have broken it . Why did you suspend behavior modification ? - Because it amused me . - Violence amuses you ? It has its moments . Who 's that with Brennick ? Rivera , Elena . Convicted of terrorism and sedition ... in connection with the Durango uprisings . Were any of our other guests implicated in Durango ? " What a tangled web we weave . " - I 'm afrraid I do not understand . - I should hope not . Why are you treating me like this ? Treating you like what ? We 're here together ... in this horrible place . Can 't we at least try to make things a little more tolerable for each other ? Not this time . You know , you 're never going to see her again . Yes , I will . Or I 'll die trying . What 's the status of my favorite fugitives ? The latest recovery team was detained ... by local authorities north of the border . A further incursion could result in a formal complaint to the embassy . I don 't care . She 's an escaped convict , a multiple breeder . Her illicit offspring is the property of the Men-Tel Corporation . This will not be over until they 're all here . One big , happy family . I really need to talk to you . I 'm sorry about last night . Just once I wish someone would feel about me ... the way you feel about your wife , you know ? What are you doing ? I 'm going out in the container . You 're nuts . You 'll suffocate in there . I won 't be in there long enough to suffocate . I 'm gonna hijack the shuttle as soon as it leaves the station . Using what ? - Help me grab his weapon . - Load ' em up . What 's wrong with your encoder ? This goddamn thing won 't work . - You can 't talk to her like that . - All I said was " damn . " - You said " goddamn . " - Don 't let it happen again . - Or we 'll report you . - Report me ? Are you two sniffing paint up here ? You better sort your shit out fast . Good as new . Like taking candy from a baby . Think . What if you 're caught ? I don 't have any choice here . Teller 's after my wife and son ... and he 's going to get them unless I get to them first . Are you gonna help me or not ? Cover me up . - Where 's Brennick ? - Still packing . - What are you looking at ? Help her . - Yes , sir . I got it . Here we go . - Watch it . - Right this way . Let 's go . - What was that ? - Pull it out . - It 's just- - - Pull it out ! Let 's go ! Open it . I said open it , goddamn it ! Oh . There it is . Sorry . It 's just my encoder . Do we have a problem ? No , sir . No problem . Miss Combs , doyou have any idea what it costs ... to keep prisoners just standing round idle ? 113.5 credits per prisoner . A rhetorical question , ZED . Thankyou . You 're welcome . Just try to keep things moving . You heard the man . Seal it up , and let 's go . Shit . Did you really think it would be that easy ? But thank you for pointing out the defects in our security . You two ? Fired . Mr. Gordon . Cut all the prisoner 's rations in half ... and double their work day . Thank you . What do I do with him ? Put him in the hole . Move ! You caught Brennick trying to escape ? I suppose you 've called up to congratulate me . Now tell me what happened . What happened is I 've got Brennick cooking in the box ... Like a Honey baked ham . I shipped enough reflector plates ... to create a downlink the size of Rhode lsland . I 'm on target to beat our transmission date . So is it so hard to say " well done " ? Fine . You did a good job . What next ? I 'd quite like to finish the other generator . Would you get serious ? It won 't cost you a dime . I have all the labor and materials I need right here . Al I 'll need from you is an electronaccelerator . What for ? Well , I 'll be able to use it ... integrate the two generators . We 'll be able to quadruple our power output overnight . You know as well as I do there 's no such thing as too much power . I can 't disagree with you there . Go ahead . Knock yourself out . Do give my love to Daddy . My man , question . Is it warmer than this up in the hole ? Would you like to find out ? Asshole . Quit using up all the hot water . - Danny asleep ? - Why ? Feeling bashful ? I won . I beat you , Dad . What are you talking about ? You can 't win . They control everything and everyone . I 'm not leaving without you . Shall I release him from the hole ? He 's already exceeded normal life expectancy by seven hours . Show me Brennick . Why , suppose he 's about done . All right . Get him out . Keep it moving . I 've got a tug full ofwater waiting for you jerk-offs to finish . - I thought you might be dead . - No such luck . - Tell me about it . - Mind your own business . First of all , this is my business . We 're working round the clock because John got a hankering to see his wife . At least he had the courage to try . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? It means he cares about someone other than himself ... which is more than I can say for you . I ain 't see no fan mail come down here for you , either ! Instead of arguing with each other ... maybe we should be trying to find a way out of this place . Yeah . Before things get anyworse around here . There 's a contusion on the subject 's right patella . There 's a small abrasion on the subject 's lefthip . There 's still some evidence of dehydration ... but the effects of hypothermia have almost disappeared . There is some residual skinblemishes ... resulting from cosmicradiation burns . There are no other apparent malfunctions . Prisoner number 27609 ... you are authorized to return to the workforce . Have a nice day . Mr. Karensky would like a word with you . I 'm listening . Mr. Karensky feels your escape attempt has done us all a great disservice . Mr. Karensky believes you are now indebted to him ... for the additional hours we all have had to work . Mr. Karensky believes that the woman will be fair recompense ... for the inconvenience you have caused . She is not mine to give . Then perhaps ... you can take her place . That 's flattering , but I think I 'll pass . - What did they want ? - Something about relations . International relations . It 's no joke . Those Russians will cut your heart out just to see the look on your face . I don 't think it 's my heart they 're interested in . Jesus ! If you don 't get the dirty , filthy thing out of here- - I told you keep that sucker outta my food ! - I tried . He won 't eat it . - He 's eating something . - Look at the size ofthat motherfucker . - Knock it off . It 'sjust a bug . Bug , my ass . Roachzilla , maybe . You notice anything funny about those security cameras ? Yeah . They 're not even focusing on what we do . Then how do they monitor us ? I tell you one thing . You better figure it out ... before we have to learn how to say " I 'm your bitch " in Russian . I 'm Dr. Preminger . Today 's topic .. Learning to love your self . I would like each and everyone of you to take a good look at the wonder- - Would you please shut up ? At least you didn 't have to listen to that while you were in the hole . Reach down and grab- - - Yo , shut up ! - Partner , she can 't hear you . Every god damn day . Shut up ! - Feel better now ? - Yeah , it was worth it . - What 's that ? - A frequency modulator . That 's a channel changer to you . Why would they need a channel changer if they 've only got one channel ? All right , ladies and gentlemen . Step on out . Let 's move it . We have a lot of work to do . I need you to listen up . Not you . - What 's up ? - Boss wants him on hard labor . This whole area needs to be completed . We need the wires repositioned and the wall panels put back up . So listen up . You know the drill . Been waitin ' a long time for this ! You 're a dead man . Really . A dead man . Unauthorized physical contact is a violation . Shall I suspend behavior modification ? You 're learning . Behavior modification suspended . Hold it ! How do you wanna go ? Look out ! Guess that makes us even . Even , my ass . What the hell happened down here ? You know what happened . Where were you ? On my break . You got a problem with that ? And where was ZED ? My apologies . We 've been experiencing some technical difficulties . I 'm sure all these problems will be eliminated shortly . Hey , Colonel Sanders . I heard you fried that redneck motherfucker . - Where are the others ? - They down at the snack shack . It 's all-you-can-eat lobster tonight . What do you want , bozo ? Food , not this shit . How bad do you want it ? Hey , Kev . Come here and look at this . Bezinsky and Sato . This ought to be good . - What are you working on ? - A remote . - Where did you get it ? - The tuner I got from the TV . The keypad and stuff I got from the new work area . Go sit down . If not for this , I 'd tear off your head and shit down your throat . Would you suspend behavior mode on 27321 , please ? My pleasure , Mr. Sato . Behavior modification for prisoner 27321 has been suspended . Your move , bozo . Let 's get outta here . Pass it from the right wing in to the center . - Goal ! - There you go . That 's what I 'm talking about . I 'm good , man . I 'm good . Is that one of those independent films ? Kiss my ass . We tapped into their surveillance system . Are you all right ? I heard about what- - - How do you do that ? - Ask him . - You gotta be kidding me . - Girl , you better recognize my skills . I can build a radio station out of a milk carton and two condom wrappers . - What 's up with the Russians ? - They 're not even watching . The fight 's a diversion . They 're up to something . Damn . It 's like they got cameras inside their heads . What are you doing ? Turn it back ! Yo , that 's me . - Kill it . - No doubt . - What 's wrong ? - The implants they gave us . They tap into the optic nerve . They see what ever we see . That 's enough ! You ever touch me again , and I 'll kill you . - You got it ? - Yeah . I understand you completely . Well , that was entertaining . Come on , Newman . Go for a walk . With the right parts , could you stitch together some kind of video recorder ? With my eyes closed . That would be the way to do it . ZED , what 's the prognosis on the second generator ? There seems to be ananomaly in the acquisition files . - Anomaly ? - The output figures ... for the new electron accelerator ... are well in excess of our power requirements . Planning for the future . I cross-refrerenced the acquisition file with future projections ... and found no relevant data . I haven 't had a chance to file all our future plans as yet . It 's difficult for me to function at full efficiency ... if I don 't have access toall relevant data . Now let 's get one thing straight here . I decide what 's relevant data , not you . So don 't bore me with these anomalies unless I ask you to . Is that clear ? That 's it , guys . We 're on playback . You guys owe me big time . That scanner chip only has about four minutes recording time . So everyone listen up . I 'm sorry , man . Doyou think this uniform makes me look fat ? What we have to do first is find a way around ZED . Forget about ZED . What are we gonna do for transportation ? We 're going to hijack the Venture Star . - ' Cause it worked so well the last time ? - There has to be anotherway . Like what ? " Beam me up , Scotty " ? The Russians have a shuttle . Excuse me ? What makes you think they have a shuttle ? Because I 'm a lieutenant ... with the Russian Federal Security Service . I have been watching them plot while they 're playing chess . It 's an old gulag trick . Most ofwhat they say is garbage ... but when they touch the queen , it 's relevant . Pretty hard to crack if you don 't know the rules . Then let 's talk to them . I gotta stay undercover . If they figure out who I am ... they 'll kill me . Then I 'll do it . Your chess stinks . You have a skill . I might as well just shuttle ... my pieces off the board . That 's an unusual choice ofwords . A metaphor , perhaps . Words , they seem meaningless . But can we escape ... their consequences ? That 's it . We 're on playback . Now we can talk . You were right . Their shuttle arrives tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Man . So what 's their plan ? If they had a plan , they wouldn 't need us . - So what 's our part ? - I told them we knew how to bypass ZED . - Did it occur toyou that we don 't ? - Yes , but we 've got 24 hours . All we need are the codes to Teller 's office ... and ZED 's security casing . Ain 't that a bitch ? Man , give me back my rag ! What 's wrong with you ? - Leave him alone , Marcus . - Leave him alone , my ass . He 's a damn klepto . Look at this shit ! Oh , oh , oh ! Fuck ! What the f- - Newman ! - Where did you get this ? - I found it . - What is it ? - An implant . Our ticket home . Pickitup , ooh , ooh Pickitup , allright Party over here Party over there Who 's the man with the mike in his hand Don 't even think about it . Damn thing would quit moving ' . - What exactly are we trying to do here ? - Don 't hurt him ! You better get the hell out of my face . I ain 't gonna hurt this damn thing . Just trying to tap into his nervous system here . Why ? Who 's the only person on this station that gets edible food ? - Teller . So ? - The roach must be eating something . - Can 't you get a better picture ? - " Can 't you get a better picture ? " Can you do it your damn self ? Now let 's see what 's on the menu . Ooh , ooh ! Allright ! Go ! Must be the cold water . I 'm going to Teller 's office . Don 't do anything I wouldn 't do . Unauthorized access is a violation . Behavior modification will commence in five seconds . It 's just me , ZED . Suspend . Suspended . He 's at Teller 's door . This is useless . We can 't see a thing . - So ? - We 're just about ready . We 've linked the two transmitters and calibrated the aiming device . All we need now is the firing pin . So when does the accelerator arrive ? She 's sending it up tomorrow with the next load of prisoners . She has no idea what we 're planning to do withit . Can I help you ? I wouldn 't mind getting a piece of that myself . Well , thank you for sharing that with me , Mr. Sato . You can go now . So hard to get good help these days . I believe I have already advised you that the new electron accelerator ... considerably exceeds our power requirements . Now she 's sulking . ZED , lock down . Newman ? Newman 's dead . It was for a good cause , you know . Good cause , my ass . We ain 't seen shit ! If that shuttle arrives and we don 't have the codes ... the Russians will kill us all . The Russians will be the least of our problems . What was that , Stan ? Buckle my shoe . Close the door . Stan , you 're a genius . We didn 't have to see the codes . We heard them . Right this way , ma 'am . Take me to his office . There 's going to be some changes around here . - Susan ? - Peter . I 've come up to take over this operation . You can 't . I 've been working on this project for ten years . My idea to turn the prison into a power station . My idea to use the convicts as labor . My idea to tie in the second generator . You think I 'm just going to stand by and let you walk awaywith it ? Peter , until this moment I didn 't think you actually had any balls . Too bad they 're not as big as mine . So sit down , shut up and pay attention . Do you think I wouldn 't have found out ... about your black op that captured Brennick in Canada ? Stalking his wife and son , overriding ZED ... executing inmates . If anyone else finds out about what you 've been doing ... you 'll be a resident here instead of the super . - Do you understand me ? - Absolutely . Good ! Then let 's unpack that electron thing and show me to my room . Do you remember the first code ? Two , three , six . Pick up sticks . Good . The second . Nine , two , four . Open the door . He 's never going to remember . Let one ofus go . He 's the only one who can cross the pain zone without having his brain fried . No brain , no pain . You ready ? There you go . Man , this motherfucker 's cross-eyed . Gotta be kiddin ' me . This shit ain 't gonna work . It 'll be fine . Go and get ' em , Stan . Go . - Huh ? - Unauthorized access . - Kev , check this out . - Behavior modification ... will commence in five seconds . - Four , three , two- - - Oh , forget it . - It 's just the nitwit . - Suspended . I 've done levels 432 , 659 and 224 . - Hello . - And I got nothing . - Everything 's negative ? - Yes . - Why don 't you help check it ? - Will do . - Nice . - Not now , you dingbat . Pick up sticks . Pick up sticks . Six , Two , three , six . Six . Come on , Stanley . Come on . Open the door . Open the door . Let 's go . Paul , get the Russians . Go to heaven . Warning . Warning . Unauthorized entry is a level one violation . Commencing behavior modification . Warning . Warning . Unauthorized entry is a level one violation . - Behavior modification ... - Get out of the way ! will achieve terminal status in five seconds . - Cut the power ! - I 'm trying ! Don 't hurt her ! She 's nice ! One . Administering . Get to the shuttle station now ! - Come on , Stanley ! - Okay . Okay . Okay . Rivera has that repressive , compulsive thing . - What ? - You know , where you have to ... wash your self over and over again . Damn it . Son of a bitch . Okay . Come on ! Where the hell are they ? Hey ! We 're not going without the others . Mr. Karensky regrets that we will be unable to accommodate your friends . But , of course , you understood that . Nikolai ? Good-bye , pig ! I got a feelin ' that 's not a Russian salute . Nice shot , though I say it myself . Damn ! That 's the first time I was happy I missed a ride . Don 't die on me , Max . My name is Yuri Rienkov . Abandoned by his colleagues and murdered in cold blood . Heartrending . Don 't you think so , Mr. Tubman ? - You traitorous son of a bitch . - What in the hell is going on here ? - Susan ! - That weapon was not authorized . It 's clever , though , isn 't it ? A hundred trillion volts of electromagnetic pulse ... powered by vast amounts of Men-Tel 's cheap electricity . And now you 've brought me the firing pin . I can burn any target in the Northern Hemisphere . Gentlemen , let 's get this overwith . Let go of me ! I didn 't mean for it to end this way . You must be very disappointed . Please ! - Guess again . - Good-bye , John . - Next . - No ! Get her off me ! Whoo ! That hurt , didn 't it ? Didn 't it ? You bitch ! Fuck you ! Mr. Sato , get ZED to restore surveillance . Mr. Tubman , toss these three miscreants into the hole . Mr. Gordon , have someone clear this up , will you ? So it was a setup from the beginning , Nestor . - You used me to find Brennick . - Wasn 't me . Told you . You were the closest one to Brennick . If anybody could lead us to him , it was you . Too bad about the wife and kid though . You know what ? You a real humanitarian , bro . Do I look like your brother , convict ? Prisoner number 27609 , Brennick , John , W. - File deleted . - Good-bye . Nice and easy now . Look out ! It can 't be that hard ! Sorry . ZED ? Systems check . An explosion in airlock 17 has compromised ... the structural integrity of that entire sector . Orbital deterioration will become critical in approximately ten minutes . - What ? - An explosion in airlock - I heard you . Can you seal off that sector ? The damage to my system precludes me from initiating structural repairs . Sealing doors 16 and 18 will have to be closed manually . - What are you doing ? - Trying to get out of this place ... before it blows up . Relax . The construction 's modular . ZED can seal up the damaged section . Besides , where areyou going to go ? Brennick , wait ! Stay with me . I 'll call my office . They 'll send someone to come get us . - And then what ? - Then I 'll pardon you . You are gonna pardon me ? - No , thanks , lady . - Brennick , wait ! The station 's orbit will continue to deteriorate ... until both sealing doors are secured . - Sir , the prisoners- - - Not now . We have a damaged sector in the new wing . - We 'll have to seal it off manually . - Sorry to interrupt , Mr. Teller . There 's an outgoing transmission from sector 17 . - Outgoing ? Retrieve it . - Are you listening to me ? Of course , Susan . You want me to send a spaceship up there ... because your stepson tried to kill you ... but a prisoner named Beswick saved your life , right ? - It 's Brennick , you idiot ! - Brennick . - I 'll have to get back to you on this . - Wait , wait ! ZED , behavior modification ... highest level . John Brennick . I 'm sorry , but that file has been deleted from the system . By whom ? You said delete all casualties . Casualties means dead , you cretin ! Yo ! Wait up ! Come on ! Oh , damn ! What the hell you do that for ? - I 'm sorry ! I didn 't know it was you ! - You 're lucky it was your head . Listen . Get everyone to the water tank . We 're going out on the tug . ZED , why didn 'tyou tell me about this ? You instructed me not to report anomalies ... unless specifically requested to do so . Orbital deterioration will become critical in approximately eight minutes . - What ? - Have you developed a hearing defect ? Unless you want the station to collapse like an egg carton ... you better get up there and seal off the damaged section ! Now where you goin ' ? I 've been hiding from Men-Tel for 10 years . I 'm not gonna let my son grow up that way . Besides , someone has to turn off the lights . You can 't use those up here ! You 'll pierce the hull ! The last thing I 'm worried about is another prick in the hull . You seal this . I 'll start on the other one . Bingo . Look what crawled out of the recycle bin . Don 't be stupid . The whole place is about to go down . Nah . Just you . Lethal dose . Drop your weapon , Sato . I am not going to let you kill another man in cold blood . Didn 't I tell you never to touch me again ? Everyone ! Keep moving ! ZED , show me Brennick ! Wait a minute . D-2 . ZED ? Stop them ! I 'm sorry . My system requirements are presently overloaded . Orbital deterioration will become critical in four minutes . Stanley , come on . I can 't- - I- - I can 't- - Shit ! Don 't say a word . - Stanley , let 's go ! Let 's go . - Come on ! - Go ! - Okay . Where 's Sato and Gordon ? - Sato is missing , and Gordon is dead . - Damn it ! You get up there and seal it off . Let 's go ! Keep movin ' ! - Let 's go ! Get outta here ! - Don 't look down ! Come on , Stanley ! Let 's go ! He can 't just have disappeared . - Perhaps he is at the new transmitter . - Patch me through then . I 'm afrraid you will have to do that manually . You denied me access to the transmitter area six days ago . Because you were reporting everything I did to the Men-Tel Corporation . Reporting is an automatic function . I have no control overit . ZED , you betrayed me . Whoa ! You left the water running . Access restored . Find him . I have located John Brennick in the transmitter control room . Not my gun ! Orbital deterioration will become critical in one minute . - Help me ! - Not now . Brennick 's got the weapon . Forget Brennick ! We gotta seal the door ! Teller , think ! The weapon is pointed at Earth ! Now what 's he gonna do with it ? Help me . Total orbital collapse will occur in ten seconds . Nine , eight , seven ... six , five , four ... three , two- - The damaged sector has been secured . Orbital stability is being restored . ZED 's coming back on-line . We 've got to get out of here now . - What about Brennick ? - He 's dead . I saw it myself . Teller shot him twice . Look , I 'm the president of Men-Tel ! I 'm ordering you to get off of this space station now- - We 're not going anywhere , you bitch . What the hell 's he doin ' ? The panels ? It 's over , John . Step away from the controls . Get over there ! Ten years . I feel like I know you ... better than anyone I 've known in my whole life . I wouldn 't bet on that . A massive power surge has destroyed all of the station 's critical functions . All personnel must evacuate immediately . A massive powersurge has destroyed all of the station 's critical functions . All personnel must evacuate immediately . Prisoner number 27609 , Brennick , John , W. You are charged with sedition , sabotage , escape ... with aiding and abetting fugitive identified as Brennick , Karen . You are also charged with- - Teller ! It 's over ! Get up the stairs ! You get up there , and you bring him down ! Have a nice- - Prisoner number 27609- - You 're out of your fuckin ' mind ! You traitorous piece of shit ! - Take my hand ! - I 'm sorry . - Take my hand ! - Sabotage , escape- - Identified as Brennick- - I 'm losin ' it ! - We 've got him ! - Hurry up ! Cut it loose ! Hold on ! - Dial the system ! - Everybody , hold on ! Mom , look . - It 's a shooting star . - Ahh . You can make a wish . I wish- - If you tell anyone , your wish won 't come true . I wish my dad would come home . Take us home . - Oh , Danny , Danny , Danny ! - Dad !

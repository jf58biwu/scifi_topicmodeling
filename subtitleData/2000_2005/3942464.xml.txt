 What are you reading ? Oh , The War of the World . A good read . I think it 's the best book Welles has written so far . A little too chilling for my liking . Martians invading earth , killing everyone with heat rays . We 've had just about everything else around here , and there 's nothing quite like a dark story to make one ... appreciate the world around us ... even if it isn 't the world you choose to live in . Come on It 's not so bad , living on the edge of paradise , away from the trouble of the outside world . What 's Challenger up to ? He 's in his lab , isn 't he ? No . As a matter of fact , I 've hardly seen him for days . He 's been acting quite mysteriously . No doubt working on some new invention to ... endanger all of our lives . That should do it . Oh , this is most impressive ! It 's much more energy than I expected . If we can enhance ... the energy enough ... I should be able to transport matter from one place to another . And if it works , we 'll be home before we know it . But first , a practical test , just to silence the critics . Let 's see ! So it 's four degrees ... six minutes ... eight seconds south ... and 54 degrees ... nine minutes and seven seconds east . So far so good . Now , that should do it . One ... small step for science ... a hopefully one giant leap for me . Marguerite and Roxton , hold onto your hats ... here I come ! What ? ! This isn 't the treehouse ! It 's a raptor nest ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Oh , bloody hell ! A raptor in hand is worth two scientists on the run . Challenger ? George ? Ufff ! What on earth is he up to ? Roxton ! Roxton ! What 's going on , George , What is all this ? The most incredible thing that you could ever imagine . Five minutes ago I was standing in the ... middle of this cave and then ... I was gone . Yes , I noticed you weren 't here when I arrived . Where did you go ? Well , not exactly to where I intended . But the point is , I did not walk there ! - No ? - No ! You remember that cave where we dragged ... Malone back from the so-called spirit world ? This entire area is riddled with hot spots ! Hot spots . Focal points of some inexplicable energy from ... the earth 's center . And this ... - is the very nexus ! - Yes , well , it 's ... It 's very bright , I 'll give you that . That 's because I polished the wall to enhance the energy . Can 't you feel a strange and powerful aura ? Well , I 'm not sure . Step into the circle . Right , good . - Now , raise your arms . - Come on ... All right . Whoa ! What is that ? That 's like an electrical charge ! Precisely ! The intersection of earth 's energy lines . And it 's more powerful here than any other place . And you found a way to tap into all of this energy ? Oh , John , I 'm going to use this ... - to get us back to London . - You what ? By amplifying the natural energy here , I 've created a resonating chamber capable of ... transporting matter from one place to another . Wait a minute ! What are you saying ? That from here you can ... magically fly us all the way back to London ? - Is that what you 're saying ? - It 's not magic , John ! This is science , pure and simple . And it works . I 've already trialed it . I tried to transport myself back to the treehouse . I only missed by about three hundred yards , which is a minor technicality . Just a matter of calibration . I don 't mean to be rude ... but it sounds a little far-fetched . Not at all , John . This could be the escape hatch we 've been searching for ! - Yeah , if it works ! - I 've been thinking about that too . And all things considered , I think it best I try this alone . - Now wait just a minute ... - Look , if it does work , and I get back to London , I will mount a return expedition to the plateau . - And if it doesn 't ? - Well , you don 't owe me anything , John . You 've saved my life more times that I can count . You always put your wants and needs second to mine . And you 've done the same for me . Oh I 'm much more selfish than you are , John . I 'm driven by a pursuit of knowledge ... Science is my Marguerite . She needs you too . Don 't you give it a second thought . He 's finally lost his mind ! Transmitting himself out of this jungle , across the ocean ! That is impossible ! Maybe so . But he 's determined to try it , and I can 't let him go alone . That is , if it really works . Are you concerned about leaving me here ? Yes . And Veronica and Malone for that matter , once they return . But most of all you . Don 't worry about me . I 'll just start reading all those books again . I 'm serious , Marguerite . You know I can 't leave you here . Even if I still have secrets ? Perhaps in time you won 't . You have taught me a great deal , Lord Roxton . And I 've enjoyed every minute of it . Well , almost every minute . Do you really think Challenger can do this ? He 's amazed us once or twice before . But this trip could be very dangerous . On the other hand , if it doesn 't kill us , it could be the only way we ever get out of this godforsaken place . That 's true . It 's a chance worth taking . 51 degrees , 30 minutes south , zero degrees ... ten minutes west ! - London , here we come ! - You hope . So , we just adjust this mirror into place ... Now , let 's see what happens ! Oh , you know how to make your passengers feel at ease , George . Oh , we will be back in London in a few seconds , traveling as fast as the speed of light itself . I 'll believe that when I see it . All right , now what ? Now , We prepare to meet the press . Last chance to run for it . If you 're wrong about this , George , I 'll never believe another word you say ! I 've never been so sure of anything in my life ! - Yeah , I 've heard that before ! - At least we 're all together . I knew you 'd say that . Here we go ! What happened ? - Well , nothing , by the look of it . - How can that be ? I 'm sure my calculations were correct ! Perhaps you made an error somewhere . All that packing and soul - searching for nothing . I 'm going back to the treehouse . I just don 't understand . I 'll leave you to it . No , no , no . I 'll come with you . I 've got to sit down and think things through . Perhaps there was too much energy . And we were tele-transported there and back . - We didn 't go anywhere , George ! - I 'm not so sure about that , this whole place looks overgrown to me . What happened to the electric fence ? Oh , how strange ! That 's nothing ! Look ! The treehouse is gone . How could that be ? I don 't know . This is very strange , This tree appears different too . Seems that the circumference is much larger ! What are you saying ? I don 't know , but a measurement will help . I 'm going to scout around awhile to see what else has changed . - I 'll be back shortly . - Don 't go too far . Don 't worry , Marguerite . I won 't be long . Just stay close to Challenger . And if I don 't see you back here , we 'll rendezvous back at the crater . Where did this come from ? New Amazonia . Ten kilometers . Greetings , stranger . Hands in the sky or I 'll blow ' em off . Nice to meet you too . - What do you want ? - Your guns , your valuables . - And you most of all . - You take good care of them . - I 'll be wanting them back . - Can I beat him to a pulp ? It 'll take a hell of a lot more than you , my friend . I 've seen plenty tougher than you . Take a seat . He ain 't gonna like that when he wakes up . - Yeah . - Neither are you . Get him in the car . Nice catch ! We 're going to cruse around town and see what 's kicking around . We 'll see you back at the oil rig . Let 's go . ... three ... Where is he ? I 'm sure he 'll be back in a minute . By my calculations , this tree is at least a hundred years older ... than it was when we left it this morning . - What ? - Oh , we 've traveled all right . Into the future ! You were supposed to be sending us back to London . Well , yes , yes , I know , but isn 't it fascinating ! Einstein 's theory of relativity postulates that ... time and space are in fact welded into a ... four-dimensional time-space continuum ! We have validated his theory ! At least Albert would be pleased . How can you stand there calmly contemplating ... the wonders of the universe , when you have just made the biggest mistake of your life ! Oh , much more than that , Marguerite . I have probably perpetrated the greatest ... blunder in scientific history ! I am going to find Roxton , and the three of us ... are going back to the crater , and you are going to whatever is necessary ... to get us back to where and when we belong ! Yes , Marguerite ! If I can ... This road surely wasn 't here this morning . Seems there 's a lot of things that weren 't ... here a hundred years ago . New Amazonia ! That 's the way to the inland sea ! Roxton 's hat ! Something must have happened to him . Clearly , he 's in some sort of trouble . These tracks were made by an automobile , I think . Perhaps it stopped to pick him up . But he wouldn 't have just left his hat . And he wouldn 't have taken a ride without waiting for us . Right ! Well the tracks go off in that direction . Let 's just take a look from the top ... of that hill and see what we can see . - It 's incredible ! - Unbelievable ! Look at all those glistening towers . It 's like something out of H. G. Welles ! I 've never seen anything so ugly in my entire life . - People actually live in those ? - Thousands of them , I would say . Do you realize what this means ? In the hundred or so years we 've jumped ahead in time , the plateau has been discovered and developed ! One way or another , we will definitely get back to London now ! - Not before we find Roxton . - Oh , no . Of course not . But let 's go and introduce ourselves to the ... inhabitants of the XXI century . If they 've done anything to harm him , their future is going to be as dreary as their bloody architecture . I 'm sure he 'll be fine , just some sort of misunderstanding . I hope so . Are you going to tell me what this is all about ? Don 't tell him nothing ! If you as me , we should bury him right here and now . Just fix the friggin ' car . He 's worth a hundred coins to us alive . A hundred coins to whom ? - You tryin ' to be funny ? - If I 'm for sale , I just want to know who 's buying , that 's all . You really don 't have any idea , do you ? Ever heard of Claude Jenkins ? - Afraid not . - He 's lying ! Everybody 's heard of Jenkins ! I told you to shut up ! Mr. Jenkins runs the whole show ... everything west of the inland sea . You must have heard of the oilfields . No , I can 't say that I have . Where you been for the last ten years ? Oh , here and there , mainly here . Don 't see many like you around these days , that 's for sure . Clean clothes , well fed . You got any friends we should now about ? Mr. Jenkins can use all the employees he can get ! To work in the oilfields , right ? Now you 're getting the picture ! You see ? It 's dangerous work . Most of the scrags we pick up don 't last a month , but ... a man like yourself , hell , - he could have a future ! - That 's good to know . How long as this , uh , Mr. Jenkins been ruling the roost ? Well , let me see now , He struck oil in ' 26 ... that 's 7 years ago now , give or take a month or so . Are you telling me it 's 1933 ? What are you ? A friggin ' alien ? Just slightly ahead of my time if it 's 1933 . Try 2033 . Have you ever imagined anything so extraordinary ? There must be skyscrapers like this all over the world . But why does everything look so rundown ? - That 's a good point . - And where are the people ? You 're right . We haven 't seen a single person . It 's ... it 's as they 've all just disappeared . And taken Roxton with them . Something terrible must have happened here ... War broke out in 2015 , all over the WHOLE world . - Who started it ? - Who the hell knows ? Didn 't even hear about it ' til the bombs started dropping ' . Nuclear bombs . Mushroom clouds , radioactive fallout ! Man , you miss the whole deal ! I 'm sorry to hear that . They started tossing them back and forth to each other like there was no tomorrow ... Which of course there wasn 't ... not for those poor suckers out there . - What are you talking about ? - There 's no one left ... except for right here , in this twisted piece of paradise . - They killed everybody ? - Not just the bombs . They chased those up with chemicals and germs . - You mean like , mustard gas ? - Yeah , whatever . The whole atmosphere got choked up . People started dropping like flies . Then the nuclear winter came , and wiped out all the rest of them . Hell , we didn 't see the friggin sun for almost ten years . Well surely there must be someone left in the world outside . Maybe there is . But hell , we ain 't heard from none of them . - How many people are there here ? - Hard to say . Before the war there was about 8 to 10 cities scattered around here . No actual bombs dropped here , so we were laughing . Thought we 'd be safe as babies . Then the radiation and the germs got us . Cities are all empty now . It 's like the end of the friggin ' world . Or a new beginnin ' , depending on your point of view . I find it hard to believe . How did it ... ever come to this ? Hell , you got the technology . You gotta use it . Right ? Oh , puke ! Morning , Finn . - Need a ride ? - You looking for a place to die ? Oh , I 've got you this time . Come on ! - Come on ! - Oh ! - Nice car - No ! - I want her alive ! - Come on . Get in , she can 't be far away ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Did you hear that ? - What on earth was it ? There 's a woman ! Marguerite , there 's a ... Hey ! Blood ! Well , there must be someone around here . Must be some kind of centre for commerce ... a trading market of some description . Hello ! - Hello yourself . - Take it easy , young lady . - I don 't mean you any harm . - Put your gun on the floor . Do it now . Now back away . Try anything , and you 're dead . Keep walking . Where to , if you don 't mind me asking . Don 't think I won 't kill you , You won 't be the first . Oh , I don 't doubt it for a minute . Are you alone or are there others like you ? Shut up ! Sit down against the wall . Now take off your pack and toss it over . - What 's this ? - It 's a dinosaur 's egg . It 's a Tyrannosaurus Rex . I was hoping to take it back to London with me . An egg . Dinosaurs roam quite freely through the plateau . Or ... have they disappeared as well ... Nothing lays an egg like this . - No , please ! - Get back ! If this is an egg , then I 'm going to eat it . If it 's food you 're looking for , I 'm afraid that is ... beyond the point of being edible . There are some dates and nuts in a tin . I guess food is scarce these days . Who are you ? Why are you here ? It was an accident , really . I ... I come from a different time . At least a hundred years ago . Liar . And about friggin ' time too . Come on . It 's time to hit the road . Go ahead ! - If you think you 're fast enough ... - I don 't want any trouble . I didn 't mean what I said about trying to kill you . Oh , you were just making polite conversation , were you . Get out of the automobile ! Sorry ! You ... you 're free to go . - We won 't try to stop you . - Do I have your word on that ? You bet ! Try again ! Do now ! Let 's see , How do I drive this thing ... ? the clutch ... where 's the brake ? And what 's this ? Try R. Okay ... D. Whoa ! Ha ! Great ! Great ! All right . That 's mine . That 's mine . And this is mine . So much for modern technology ... Challenger , where are you ? In my time , none of this was here except for the inland sea . I live in the jungle , not too far from here . What you say isn 't possible . Oh , but it is . This whole plateau is ... was virtually untouched back then . It was pristine , it was beautiful . There were lakes , rivers ... animals as big as a house . - An incredible paradise of sorts . - I don 't believe you . What happened to the people ? Where did everybody go ? They died . All of them . How ? And how do you know ? I know what I was told by people who didn 't lie . Yes , but what happened ? I mean , did an asteroid crash into the earth ? - What 's an asteroid ? - Like a shooting star from outer space . No ! People did it with bombs and chemicals . - Another war to end all wars . - But I survived . What happened to your parents ? They got sick and died when I was four . That 's when this terrible war began . But there must have been others like you who did survive . There were . We lived in the subways and sewers ... underground where it was safe , until the air was clean again . - How long did that take ? - I was a teenager . The city was empty except for us . Until the slavers came for workers to ... die in the mines and oilfields . My friends ... my family ... - they took them all . - I 'm so sorry . It 's over now . It 's in the past . But how can you live like this ? So ... all alone . I 'm free . And that 's all I want . When I catch this guy , I 'm going to rip his eyes out ! You might just get your wish ! Well , nail me to the wall and call me siding . Looks like he got it stuck pretty good . Get the winch out . I 'll see if I can start it . - Where are you taking me ? - I 'm letting you go . Without my gun ? I need them more than you do . At least I 've got my egg . I 'm certainly grateful for that . Challenger ! There you are ! - Throw down your weapons ! - Do as she says . Where did she come from ? She lives here . This is her home . - Take off your pack . - Oh , no , wait a minute ... - She just wants to look inside . - Now , hurry up ! A common little thief if ever I saw one ! There 's nothing in there , really . Diamonds ! Where did you get these ? - They are mine ! - Not anymore . Now go . Get out of here ! Sure you wouldn 't like to come with us ? At least give us back our weapons ! So you can shoot me ? Go ! Before I change my mind ! Come on , George . We have to find Roxton . Well , almost back to where I started . What the hell ! Not again ! Run , you dog ! He 's worth a hundred coins to us alive . Who needs money ? I 'd rather blow his brains out ! Well , we can 't just leave her here , Marguerite . What exactly are you proposing ? She robbed us , took our guns . She doesn 't want anything to do with us ! I was hoping to run into you again . I bet you were . But not like this . Drop your pack , and your weapons . Let me go , Burke . You don 't need me . I need you most of all , Finn . There was a time when I was the most important thing in your life . Before you sold us out and became one of them . I 've got to go back for her . What ? Oh ! I 'm going to kill you , Burke . - Really . - I swear it . That 's no way to talk to the man who made you a woman . Walk . - Hey you ! - What 's going on ? Get out of here ! - Where the hell you been ? - I was looking for you ! Finn 's found some new friends . We have to get back to the crater before the sun goes down ! - I am not going without Roxton . - No , no , of course not ! But the plan was to rendezvous back that the crater . Let 's hope he 's waiting there for us . Now go , come on go ! I 'm tired of running , boys . More fun that getting drunk . Last chance to turn back now ! - We 're taking him alive ! - The hell we are ! Whoa ! Damn ! No wonder there 's no one left in this world . Go that way . We 'll circle around . Drop the gun . Do it now ! Walk away . It 's over ! Whatever you say , stranger . No harm done . No harm at all . Are they still following us ? I can 't tell for sure but I hope so ! - Why ? - Unfinished business . We 're almost there . Marguerite ! Challenger ! This isn 't any good ! Where the bloody hell are you ? Roxton ? - Where have you been ? - Learning to drive . Who 's your new companion ? Companion ! She robbed us , could have gotten us killed ! I let you go ! You didn 't have to come back for me . Finn , this is our very good friend , Lord John Roxton . John Roxton will do . Nice to meet you , Finn . Nice guns ! Can you get us out of here ? Yes , I 'm certain I can . All if have to do is set the co-ordinates back to zero . That 'll be our best chance . Well , I 'm coming with you . - It 's time to move on . - Oh , now wait a minute ! We saved your life ! We don 't owe you any more than that . Oh , Marguerite , come on ... Damn it ! Who the hell is this ? Slavers . They tried to grab Finn ... back in the abandoned city we found . - New Amazonia ? - Most horrible place I 've ever seen . Throw down your weapons ! - How many are there ? - Two . Right . George , you 'd better go back and reset those co-ordinates . I 'll keep you covered . Go now ! Did you hear ? The year is 2033 ! The world has destroyed itself ! So I 've been told . Where the hell is she going ? Taking care of number one , by the looks of it . Like somebody else I used to know . Well , we 're better off without her then . The coordinates are set ! Ready when you are . One down , one to go . Going someplace ? Take it easy , Finn . You know I 'd never hurt you . - Never again , that 's for sure . - Let me go . - You 'll never see me again . - This is for all our friends . - The family you destroyed . - I didn 't have a choice . Hurry up , George , reset this thing to get us ... back to 1922 . - Well , where is she ? - She took off ! We can 't save her if she won 't save herself ! It had better work this time , George . Our only hope to change this unfortunate future . - What are you doing here ? ! - I said I was coming with you . Well , are we back ? Did we make it ? I don 't know . Too much energy ! This place is falling apart ! What 's going on ? Where did it go ? There must be so much energy in that cave , it 's still traveling through time ! So where does that leave us ? Still on the plateau . But when ? - You hear that ? - It 's a T-rex ! We made it . What is that ? That ... is where we live . Welcome to the past . Well , what do you think of your new home ? Not bad , It 's better than what I left behind . Well , I 'd have to agree with you about that ! And what a miserable future we have to look forward to . What was that you were saying about changing it , George ? When we get off the plateau , we have to warn the world ... what lies ahead in the future , if we can 't ... find a way to stop the war . What if we never get out of here ? Oh we will . One day . We have to . It 's more important now than ever ! I mean , how else do we prevent the end of civilization ? We may have already started . - How so ? - By bringing Finn back with us , we 've made a small but hopefully ... significant alteration in the course of history . Are you saying that by saving one person 's life , - we 've changed the world ? - We have to start somewhere . She may be our brightest hope for a better tomorrow . If that 's the case , I 'm very glad you brought her with us . Oh , I think it was her choice , not ours . So ... which room is mine ? *

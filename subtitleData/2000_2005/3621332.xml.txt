 The following is a special episode of The X-Files . Viewer discretion is advised . COPS is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement . All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law . I don 't know what it is about a full moon . There 's something about it . People just go off the wall . These are pretty scary neighborhoods to begin with . I haven 't been on the job that long , but I 've seen more than my fair share of crazy stuff . When the moon is full it 's just , like , times ten . I don 't know , maybe it 's the tides or somethin ' . But irregardless , we 're on the job , and if that makes people breathe easier knowing ' we 're out there , or be a little less nervous walking the streets at night , that 's a good feeling . OK . We got a report of somebody lurkin' around the neighborhood makin ' noise . Actually , I take that back . We got a report of a ... monster lurking ' in the neighborhood ? What ? Hey , it 's a full moon . Lot of drug activity here . It 's probably somebody rattling ' doorknobs , tryin ' to steal money for a fix . Usually they 're not the stealthiest of criminals , so maybe we 'll get lucky . Sneak up on him . 2-12 Adam is 10-97 . 2-12 Adam is 10-97 at 543 Vogel . 2-12 Adam to Dispatch. I don 't see anything . Can you let the lady inside know I 'm here ? 2-12 Adam . Copy your request . Calling now . Figures , don 't it ? A lot of scratches . Maybe a big dog 's probably what she saw . Sheriff 's Department . Usted ... usted ... Calma usted . No . No , no ... no monstruo . No . Señora ... Búscalo ! Man , she 's scared of somethin ' . You there ! You ! Freeze ! Sheriff 's Department ! Freeze ! Sheriff 's Department ! Run ! To the car ! Back to the car now ! Now ! Run ! Goddammit , run ! Now ! Now ! Come on ! Go , go , go ! Back to the car ! Come on ! Run ! Run ! Get in the car ! Get in the car ! Holy ... Come on ! Now ! 10-33 , 10-33 ! 2-12 Adam needs assistance ! I need assistance at the 500 block of Vogel ! 999 ! 999 ! Everybody all right ? Hey , you all right ? You all right ? Keith , what was this ? I was responding to a 921 at this house right here and it was a prowler call . - You flipped it ? - No , no . Hell , no , I didn 't flip it . It was ... We were parked ... - lt ... We were attacked . - By who ? By gangbangers ? Keith ? Yeah . Yeah , it was gangbangers . OK , fan out and search . OK ? - Sarge , you better double everybody up . - OK , hold on . Everybody double up . Set up a command post and check on that air ship . How many ? Keith . Keith . I ... I didn 't get a good look . Maybe ... Two 417 suspects on foot just one block north of Holly . Armed suspects ! Bring some units around by Holly Street ! Get your hands up in the air ! - We 're the fbi ! - fbi ! Turn around ! - l 've got id in my back pocket . - We 're investigating a case . - Check the id . - Behind your head ! Check my id in the back pocket . - They 're fbi . Give ' em back their guns . - Thank you . - We 're investigating a case . - What case ? - The same case you 're workin ' on . - So who we lookin ' for ? Not " who . " " What . " Mulder , what the hell is going on here ? You OK ? See the claw marks here ? Someone tried to get in . Deputy ? Deputy , can you describe for me what you saw ? I mean , it 's pretty dark , you know . I ... didn 't really see ... I don 't know . Well , you must have seen something in order to run away from it . Huh ? You were responding to the same call we were , of a monster prowling . We 've been to this house before . The lady has a history of medication . But she 's not the only one seeing monsters . There were half a dozen sightings in this area in the past 60 days . Were you aware of that ? - No . - Yeah . Sightings only occur when there 's a full moon , which tells me something . What ? What you saw was large , right ? Seven , eight feet tall when it stood up on its two legs ? And it was covered in fur and had glowing red eyes and claws . Claws sharp enough to gouge the wood off that front door . - You 're not serious . - And dare I forget teeth . It bit you , didn 't it ? Look at that . Deputy , how long were you going to hide that from the EMTs ? - Where did you get that , Keith ? - l don 't even know where that came from . I didn 't see anything that he 's talking about . Big teeth , eight feet tall . - What the hell are you describing ? - A werewolf . - Excuse me ? - lt 's what did that . It also attacked one Hymen Escallera 29 days ago during the last full moon . He died of his wounds , but not before giving a detailed description of what attacked him . My partner and I are here to catch it . Unfortunately though , Deputy , you 've been bitten . The skin is broken . Werewolf lore universally holds that someone who 's bitten by such a creature will become such a creature himself . Wait a minute. I mean ... But that 's not what really happened , though . I 'm sorry , but you 're gonna have to be isolated and kept under guard . With respect , what the ... are you talking about ? Preventing this man from becoming a danger to himself and to others . - Can I see your badge again ? - Agent Mulder ? Can we have a word a second ? Excuse me . What is it ? " What is it " ? Mulder , have you noticed that we 're on television ? I don 't think it 's live , Scully . She just said ... But it 's a camera and it 's recording . It 's recording everything that you are saying . I just wanna make sure that you 're clear on that . I 'm clear on that , Scully . My point being , Mulder , that we 're on a case . This presents an opportunity . We 're very close here . The possibility of concrete proof of the paranormal ? Of a werewolf in front of a national , even an international audience ? What 's not to love ? Mulder , you wanna talk about werewolves to me , you can knock yourself out . I may not agree with you , but at least I 'm not gonna hold it against you . But this ? - Mulder , this could ruin your career . - What career ? Scully , I appreciate it . You don 't want me looking foolish. I do , I appreciate that . I don 't want me looking foolish , Mulder . OK , fine . Well , do me a favor . Will you escort Deputy Wetzel to the hospital ? Just keep an eye on him in case I 'm right . Thank you . - l 'm gonna call Skinner , Mulder . - OK . I 'm sure he 's gonna wanna say a couple of words about this . Guys , give it a rest , huh ? She says a ... I guess she 's calling it a " claw monster , " was trying to break in and get her . It was big and had claws , pretty much . She 's going on and on . Tell her to describe it to the sketch artist . Will you work with her ? - " Claw monster " ? - Just do it , Ricky . OK . Look at that . Excuse me . Look at this. lt 's like five claw marks . Like the human hand has five fingers . Pretty much the same spread . Agent , you seriously believe we 're looking for some kind of a ... ? I 'll show you . This ... This is what Hymen Escallera described just before succumbing to his injuries . Ten to one that 's what Mrs Guerrero 's gonna describe , too . Sir ? Sir ? We got your suspect . Claw monster . Claw monster . Claw monster . You know , they kill him in every movie and he just keeps coming back . This is strange . Gracias , Mrs Guerrero . We 're looking for gangbangers . You don 't think it 's some guy dressed up like Freddy Krueger , do you ? Can you walk me to my car ? It 's dark and I 'm parked up the street . - l 'll walk you to your car . - Can I return this vest later ? - Yeah , Ricky . - This is what she was ... ? That 's what she 's saying . That 's the claw monster , man . You catch ? Catch him ? Si , si . You catch . How 's Deputy Wetzel ? - You let him get released ? - Well ... those weren 't teeth marks , Mulder . They turned out to be insect bites . Individual welts or stings of some sort . Together , they just looked like a larger pattern . Especially when we want them to . Although it 's an understandable conclusion that I 'm sure anybody would have made . So what did Skinner say ? He said that the fbi has nothing to hide . And neither do we . If it makes you feel better , I 'm not convinced that we 're looking for a werewolf anymore . - All right , good . - No , something else . I 'm not sure what . Some other kind of creature , though . Hey , hey , what 's going on ? Six blocks from here . Could be what we 're looking for . No . You go with someone else . Guys , watch out. i 'm a doctor . Oh , man , it 's Ricky . That 's what I was afraid of , Scully . When a fellow officer goes down in the line of duty , or even if it 's not an officer , if it 's just somebody working part-time with the department in a support , um ... artistic capacity , like Ricky there ... we all feel it . Back there is every cop 's worst nightmare . But that 's when you gotta cowboy up and give 150º / o . Catch the bad guys . Last call from here was to the Road Club . Ricky requesting assistance for his flat tire . He asked them to hurry . He said he didn 't feel safe . - What 's that ? - Our suspect , apparently . Slash marks match up pretty well , wouldn 't you say ? Somebody lost a nail . Nice color . Check out this color , Mulder . Blood red . Hey , who called 911 on this ? - Hey , Steve and Edy ? Sergeant Paula . - The Steve and Edy ? They 're good folk . They usually call us if there 's trouble in the neighborhood . - Oh , my God ! Look at all these people ! Lord ! - How are you two doing this evening ? - We 're fine . - Can y 'all tell us what happened out here ? Not with me looking like this ! You should know better than that , Sergeant Paula . Like she gonna run from a camera . Lookee here . We heard all this screaming . Peeked out the window and this boy with crazy hair was having a conniption fit , all rolled up there by the phone . You didn 't see his attacker ? - l 'm ready for my close-up . - Nobody care ' bout your scabby ass . This is police business . Now , I didn 't see ... What 'd you say ? " Attacker " ? No , he was just kind of all rolled up and yellin ' . Did you see anything ... that looked like this ? Ooh , stop . - Or this ? - Excuse me ? - That 's gonna give me nightmares . - So you didn 't see anything at all ? Mm-mm , no . Did you see a woman ? Chantara. I 'd know that skanky-ass color anywhere . - Sure do . - ls Chantara a streetwalker ? - She work the corner . She on the pipe . - Oh , yeah . So we don 't associate , you know what I 'm saying ? Well , we should go talk to Chantara , then . - Well , I wish you would . - That 's right . Hey . Hey , when am I gonna get my own TV show ? Aw , just shut up now . Stop ! Get in there ! Would you excuse us ? Excuse us . Bye , y 'all . So apparently we 're on the lookout for someone whose hair matches her fingernails . Bubble-gum pink . That 'd be a good color for you , Scully . I 'd have to say that at this point in the investigation I 'm usually a little more secure in what it is we 're actually investigating , but we 've so many conflicting eyewitness reports that it 's hard to ascertain exactly what it is we 're looking for . But the crimes we are investigating are paranormal . I can say that ... with absolute conviction . And the nature of the crimes - they 're notoriously hard to quantify at any kind of rigorous scientific level , as Agent Scully will tell you . Oh , yeah . Which , in its ... in its own way , is a kind of a validation , if you think about it , in and of itself . But , you know , that 's ourjob . That 's why they pay us the big bucks . Bubble-gum pink . - Don 't run ! fbi ! - Chantara Gomez ? Chantara Gomez ! Don 't run ! It 's OK. lt 's OK . - lt 's all right . - Chantara Gomez ? - Can I see your hands please ? - l didn 't do nothing ! May I see your hands , please ? It 's OK . Let me see your hands . Show her your hands . Earlier this evening , a man was attacked . He was badly slashed . And you realize this places you at the crime scene ? Fisher and Belmont . That 's your usual hang . Look , I heard screaming , OK ? And I went and I tried to help this guy , and when I heard the sirens , I just ran away. I didn 't do nothing ! I believe you. I think you saw something . You witnessed something . Tell me what it is . - l can 't . - You can tell us , Chantara . Chantara ... if you 're afraid that what you tell us , we 're not going to believe it , don 't be . Cos whatever it is you saw tonight , whatever it is , whatever you think you saw , however strange or terrifying or bizarre , you are not going to surprise me , OK ? You 'll protect me from Chuco ? Who 's Chuco ? Mi novio . He 's the one who cut that guy up , not me ! I didn 't do anything ! - What ? - " Mi novio . " Her boyfriend . No , no , I got that . Look , he 's been chasing me for a week , OK ? He said he would twist my neck off like a chicken if I didn 't give him more money . Chuco . Chuco Muños ! The cops know who he is ! This is my favorite part of the job , knockin ' down crackhouses . I don 't understand. I told you everything . Why can 't I just go now ? You are not out of the woods as far as accessory charges go . - Chuco 's the one you want ! - So if we find him , we can let you go . He 's gonna kill me ! He told me he was gonna twist my neck off like a chicken ! - No one 's gonna kill you . - He 's gonna kill me ! Chantara , look around you ! You see all the deputies here ? You see ? No one is going to get you . What 's more , Deputy Wetzel is gonna keep an eye on you while we put the cuffs on Chuco . No one is going to get you . Chuco Muños , the man himself . Only distinguishing feature is a tattoo on his skull . - He 's not our guy . - What do you mean ? I don 't care how bad his rep is , he can 't turn over a squad car . - Not by himself , but he 's got friends , right ? - No , there 's something else going on . Let 's hit it . OK , let 's hold all radio traffic . Go , go , go ! Hands above your head ! Put your hands above your head ! Go , go , go ! You seen Chuco Muños ? The house is clear ! - Stand up in here . - Get on the wall . Take your hands off me . Oh , man . Agents ? Agents , in here . Hey , what happened , huh ? Wake up . - What happened to your friend in there ? - Check out the tattoo . - Looks like he OD 'd . - Yeah , but how long ago ? Couple of days , maybe a week . He didn 't attack Ricky Koehler , that 's for sure . Shots fired . 2-12 Adam , be advised that you 're a 923 . There ! What you got ? What you shooting at ? What you shooting at ? Keith , what are you doing ? It came back. lt was here . - Keith ... - lt was here . Oh , man . I heard her screaming and I tried to stop it . I swear to you , I did everything I could do . - Oh , shoot . - l did everything I could do . What is it , Mulder ? What ... - Call it in . - 2-12 Bowie. I have a possible 927 . I wish someone would explain what the hell is going on. lt doesn 't make sense . Keith Wetzel may be a little green , but he is a solid deputy , a squared-away individual . Nothing could have gotten past him and killed that woman . There 's no sign of what he was shooting at . This was all we found . 9mm. lt 's our issue . - Where was it ? - ln the middle of the street . Doesn 't look like a ricochet . Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at . Excuse me . Hey , Deputy ? You ready to talk to me now ? You and I both know you saw something . We 're way past claiming you didn 't . I only know what I thought I saw . Well , describe it for me . The wasp man . The wasp man ? It 's ridiculous . The scary stories my older brother used to tell me when I was a kid about a monster with a head like a wasp and a mouthful of stingers instead of teeth . He said that it would come get me in my sleep and that ... and that it would sting me to death . So you 're saying that the wasp man attacked you both times ? Here and in the patrol car ? I 'm not saying that that 's what it was , OK ? I mean , they didn 't see it . It 's not on the video tape . This ... this can 't be real . I think maybe it can . Just relax a minute . Excuse me . Scully ? - We came here looking for a werewolf , right ? - Well , you did , that 's correct . Hymen Escallera claimed he was attacked by a werewolf and the wounds that he sustained would seem to bear that out , right ? And then Wetzel over here sees a wasp man with stingers for teeth , and he gets a bite mark that you say is irrefutably insectlike , right ? Mulder , that 's not exactly ... Another eyewitness claims she sees Freddy Krueger . What if we 're dealing with one creature , one entity , that when it attacks appears to you as your worst nightmare ? Fear . Maybe that 's what this thing feeds on . - OK , well , for the sake of this argument ... - Yeah ? how would one catch something like that ? Probably by figuring out how it chooses its prey . It seems to spread like a contagion , doesn 't it ? One person 's fear becomes the next . There 's a chain of victims . It went from Mrs Guerrero to Wetzel and the sketch artist , and then from the sketch artist to Chantara Gomez and then ... Back to Wetzel . But you 're missing someone . Who ? Edy . Steve and Edy . They 're a part of this chain , and according to your theory they 'd have been attacked , right ? Well , we 're back at the home of Steve and Edy . Thought we 'd check on them because they seem to fit a victim profile . I 'm sorry . Are you talking to me ? What the hell is this ? What the hell is this ? - Steve , are you gonna be all right ? - l 'm all right . Somebody gonna ask me if I 'm all right ? I 'm the victim. I 'm the victim here ! He don 't treat me right . You better appreciate me or I 'll walk out . - The hell you would ! - We 're not here to get involved in personal ... - He treats me with disrespect . - Shut up ! We 're not here to get involved in personal problems . - You shut up ! - Settle down . He won 't make love to me . I should never have touched your stupid ass ! Look , you guys ... Steve , Edy ... The reason why we are here is because we are concerned about your safety , we are concerned about your lives . You witnessed a violent attack right across the street . So you say. I just saw a rolled-up boy with crazy hair . Because of your proximity to the attack we think you may be targeted as well . - Why ? Because we called the police ? - No , no . That 's not why . That 's not why . I can 't really explain it exactly ... I think the key is to remain unemotional , OK ? Try to stay calm . Try to keep your heart rate down . Try to keep your adrenaline down . Just try to relax . Just ... Oh , you got it . Good luck ! Oh , you ! I think maybe we should stay here for a little while . Let 's just ... Let 's just ... Let 's just relax . Mr Mulder ? Lookee here , I gotta go to bed . How you doing , Edy ? You still upset ? I 'm scared . You 're scared ? I 'm scared he gonna leave me . No , no , no , no . Think we should take ' em to a hotel ? We don 't need no hotel . We 've been livin ' in this house for 17 years . - Ain 't nobody gonna chase us out . - You 're not afraid ? Now , I didn 't say that. I said , ain 't nobody going to chase us out . Oh , God . More of you ? - We any closer to an arrest ? - l 'm afraid not . Mulder , what next ? I 'd say we should station deputies here , but I don 't think it 's coming back here . We 're just playing catch-up with this thing . It doesn 't do what you 'd expect . And , well , we 've got four or five hours till the moon sets . The attacks only occur on the full moon . Then we 're out of luck . Well , I want to examine Chantara Gomez . - For a possible contagion ? - Your " contagion of fear " ? - Yeah . - No . But if I can 't find what this thing was , at least I can find what it wasn 't . Make it fast . And fill that tank up with gas . Deputy , you 're the only person who 's seen this twice , so I 'd like to ride with you . - Let 's go . - Thanks . You really believe me , huh ? You really believe I saw what I thought I saw ? Yeah , I believe you . - Why ? - Why do I believe you ? Yeah . What proof do you have what I 'm saying is real ? I mean , it 's not on the video tape . The camera doesn 't always tell the whole story . And what about your partner ? Does she believe me ? I don 't think she thinks you 're lying . Yeah , but what ? Maybe I 'm crazy ? I 've been on the job 18 months . Right out of the gate , I get some kind of rep like I 'm crazy ? I mean , you know how cops are . How 's somebody supposed to live that down ? I don 't know . I guess just do good work . It 's a hard enough job already , you know ? You want to help people , but it 's like the freakin ' Wild West out here . People hate you . Every shift , I go out thinking ... Go ahead . I go out thinking " There 's somebody out there who wants to take me out . " " Am I going to run into him tonight ? " And it 's hard to have a fast-track career in law enforcement if everybody thinks you 're nuts . Tell me about it . Chantara Gomez , age 31 . Apparent cause of death is the fracturing of the second and third cervical vertebrae . There are contusions consistent with choking or throttling , by very powerful hands . People are saying her pimp killed her from beyond the grave . That 's the story going around . Crazy , huh ? Let 's see if we can put that story to rest , shall we ? The other thing I heard was ... something about contagion ? Like , with this body ? That 's completely ... inaccurate . This , uh ... investigation is ... We 're moving towards an apparent chain of victims , and I seriously doubt that we 're going to find anything like a contagious pathology here . Because if we were , we should be taking precautions . If the body could be contagious ... - We 're not even wearing masks . - Look , this is obviously a murder here . I mean , this woman died of a broken neck , right ? Not the hantavirus . - Who said anything about the hantavirus ? - Nobody. I just ... I was ... lt was a figure of speech . It 's just , the reason I ask is why is it so urgent to do an autopsy at three in the morning ? I mean , that kind of rush , it 's just unheard-of . We are trying to look for the killer . Well , we got murder victims stacked three-deep in the freezer . Plus you got this camera crew recording everything . Why ? Because the fbi has nothing to hide . Look , there is no ulterior motive here. lt 's just ... Are you going to help me out here , or what ? Yeah . Of course . Thank you . - Why did you mention the hantavirus ? - Look ... Oh , my God . Call 911 . Call 911 ! 911 ! Get out of here ! Come on ! It 's not the hantavirus . It looks for all the world like the hantavirus , but I can promise you that it 's not . Well , I mean , she exhibited all the symptoms - the hemorrhagic fever , the severe chills , the acute shock ... But , I mean , the thing is that they all developed in a matter of seconds , and the hantavirus doesn 't kill that fast . I mean , no virus in the world kills that fast . You were talking about the hantavirus right before she died ? Why ? Because she kept bringing it up . I mean , it was like the power of suggestion . She was standing there , she was saying that she was afraid of contagion , then all of a sudden she just ... She was afraid . and her fear killed her in the worst possible way that she could imagine . - What do you mean ? - lt 's the same . The same MO as the others . This entity or force somehow vectored off Chantara Gomez to attack this other woman . No , Mulder. I was standing right here. I didn 't see anything . They didn 't see anything . Yeah , but you weren 't afraid . The hell I wasn 't , Mulder . I don 't know what 's going on . You weren 't afraid for your life . Neither were Steve and Edy , and it left them alone . Mortal fear. I think that 's what it comes down to . This thing , whatever it is , is attracted to that . Everybody who was attacked felt it intensely . - For ... sakes ... - No , no. lt makes perfect sense . You asked me earlier what this thing was doing in Willow Park . It 's a high-crime neighborhood , where people live behind barred windows and are afraid to go out at night . - Where 's Deputy Wetzel ? - Back on patrol . Mulder , you were with him for three hours . You didn 't see anything . But I was with him. I was backing him up . Like I said , there 's something about a full moon . Things definitely get strange . Well , we checked everyplace else tonight . Let 's check this place again . Come on . God ... I 'm calling for backup . Get out ! Get out , now ! Get out ! - lt won 't open ! - Let 's go ! I got it , I got it ! Come on ! - Oh , God ! Oh , God ! - l can 't open it ! There 's Wetzel 's car . Wetzel ? Get the battering ram . That gun 's not gonna do you any good . It 's the battering ram . Well , how come they 're not in yet ? Wind ? If you say so . What the hell is that ? Damn. I hate you guys . - Where 's Wetzel ? - We don 't know . Something 's out there . Stay where you are . Look at this , Scully . Deputy Wetzel ? You guys need assistance ? Wetzel ? Wetzel ? - Wetzel ? - My God , get this thing off of me ! - Get it off of me ! - Wetzel ! Please , help me ! No ! Wetzel , don 't be afraid ! It can 't hurt you ! Don 't be afraid ! That 's what it wants ! Hello ? Wetzel ? It can 't hurt you ! You 're a ... sheriff 's deputy , Wetzel ! Don 't be afraid now ! And you 're on national television , so cowboy up ! You can 't hurt me ! You can 't hurt me ! No ! You can 't hurt me ! Wetzel ? He 's alive . - Deputy Wetzel ? - We 're up here ! What happened ? The sun just came up . Be strong . Hang in there , kid . You think the deputy stopped it , whatever it was ? Maybe itjust went away until the next full moon . There 's enough fear in the world , if it doesn 't show up here it 'll show up someplace else . You didn 't get the proof you wanted , Mulder . Well , hey , it all depends on how they edit it together . It 's gonna be a hard one to write up . - 132 and Bush , I got him at gunpoint . - Gunpoint , 132 and Bush . Cover 's code three .

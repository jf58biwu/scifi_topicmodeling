 [ RadioSignals ] I 'm sorry . [ Sobbing ] Sir , she 's breaking out ! [ Men Coughing ] - Go ! Go ! - What are we looking for ? Come on ! Double quick ! She 's gone over the fence ! [ Train Whistle Blows ] Aah ! A couple of trains came through here around about the time she escaped . You think she could 've gotten this far in that time ? Is she that fast ? She is that fast . And this , too ? 3.10 . $ 3.10 ? Right . Here 's your change . Thank you . Can I help you ? The total 's 17 95 . Here 's your card . Are you going to buy those ? Watch your step . Have a nice trip . It 's a brown tweed bag with leather trim , kind of like a duffel . Do you see it anywhere ? Porter said he was going to put it on the cart . This is the cart , but there 's no bag . Government authorities said this was the largest earthquake to strike an urban area in nearly 50- - He 's riding Green Lightnin ' . Whoa ! That 's Shorty Kincaid . Enjoy the view . Excuse me . We shouldn 't be seen together . Father hasn 't been dead more than 48 hours . Do you think Arlen suspects ? No . It 's not too soon for us to be together . Good . [ Knock On Door ] Tickets , please . Ooh , are you traveling by yourself ? What , you 're 12 ? Someone going to meet you in Los Angeles ? We 'll say that you 're 11 . That way you only have to pay half price . Can 't believe our little girl did this . She 's not a little girl . DNA typing and material found in those wounds proves it was her . Well , she could be anywhere- - Chicago , Las Vegas , Los Angeles , anywhere . We should stop all the trains . And have the railroad and local police ask a million questions we can 't answer ? We 'll put key personnel at every stop along these lines . I want a team to track her , hunt her down . Good morning , Jill . Hello . Thank you for taking care of my cat . We 'll take very good care of you , won 't we , Lorca ? I won 't be gone for very long . Take care of yourself . Bye-bye . Are you still having problems with the people at work ? They 'll point the finger at me , saying ... I 'm the weird one . I 'm the strange one . Why , because I have feelings ? Because I feel ? There 's someone at the door . [ Knock On Door ] I won 't answer that . Whoever it is , they can come back at the end of the hour . That 's for me . Sorry I have to interrupt . We need your help , Dan . I know . Uh ... got to go . Oh , God . Aah ! Oh , God . [ Screaming ] Ow ! Mr. Fitch will be with you all in just a moment . Well , I guess we all must be here for the same reason ... whatever that is . I 'm Dan Smithson . And I don 't know why I 'm here , either , but they said they needed me and that it was very important , so I came . What do you do , Dan ? I ... I 'm an empath . Sometimes they show me awful things that people have done , and then I try to tell them why they did it . What qualifies you for that ? I feel things deeply , that 's all . What am I feeling right now ? You want to believe that nothing affects you , that ... you 're not afraid of anything , but you 're curious , just like the rest of us . Ahem . Steven Arden , Harvard anthropology department- - expert in cross-cultural behavior . Laura Baker . Hi . Molecular biologist . Hi . And who are you , and what do you do ? Preston Lennox ... and if I 'm here , I think the shit has definitely hit the fan . What exactly is your area of specialty ? Let 's just say I 'm a freelance solution to some of our government 's problems . And what exactly might they be ? The kind that people don 't usually like to talk about . You hunt people , don 't you ? I guess so . [ Television Plays ] You in here , honey ? It 's a little late for TV . You in here , honey ? Aah ! Good evening . I 'm Xavier Fitch . I 'm in charge of this operation . Will you sit a little closer , please ? In November of 197 4 , a small group from S.E.T.I. , S-E-T-l- - Search for Extraterrestrial lntelligence- - used the radio dishes at Arecibo to send out a message to whoever might be listening . They sent about a quarter of a kilobyte , including structure of human DNA , map of our solar system , population of the Earth , helpful facts like that . In January of 1993 , Arecibo received a message back from an extraterrestrial unknown source . That 's great . Intelligent life beyond this planet . Yes . There were two distinct communications . The first message turned out to be a superior catalyst for methane . We now have the potential to produce an infinite amount of energy from this clean-burning fuel . This convinced us that we were dealing with a friendly intelligence . The second message turned out to be a new sequence of DNA with rather friendly instructions on how to combine it with ours . Here 's some technical data . You can get feedback on it from Dr. Baker here . Basically , the new combined DNA sequence was injected into 100 human ova . We got seven to divide- - four petered out , two were stored in liquid nitrogen , and we allowed one to grow . That 's its code name there- - Sil . That 's after two hours . One day . Two days . - My God . - This growth is amazing . That 's a week . It 's a girl . Yes , I ... We decided to make it female so it would be more docile and controllable . More docile and controllable , huh ? I guess you guys don 't get out much . That 's her one month after she was born . So you kept her caged ... in there . We decided it would be safer to keep her in isolation . She didn 't like being locked up like that . She didn 't like being alone . Didn 't she ? She 's hiding something , something inside . You 're right , Dan . This is three months after she was born , and you watch carefully . Aah ! What the hell was that ? Back the tape up . Watch her eyes . Rapid eye movement . She 's dreaming . Aah ! She 's having horrible nightmares . It 's some kind of anxiety reaction . Got me a little anxious . It made the research team a little anxious , too , so the decision was made to terminate the experiment , to run more research so that we could determine what we were dealing with . You were going to gas her ? That was the decision . It makes you feel bad . It makes you feel bad you had to kill her . I don 't know . Wow . Yes . Yesterday morning the body of a transient was found in a boxcar on a siding near Salt Lake City . Preliminary DNA tests conclude he was killed by our creation , by our Sil . Have you found other bodies ? No , we haven 't . Not yet . You will . She 's a predator . Her eyes are in front . Her eyes are in front so she can judge the distance to her prey . That 's right . Where did you learn that fact ? I saw it on a documentary on the Discovery Channel . I caught that show myself . Mr. Lennox . Y eah . As the , um ... well , the nonscientist amongst us , are you at all clear about what 's going on here ? Well , I think so . You created a monster with some kind of formula you got from outer space , the damn thing got away , and now you want us to hunt it down and kill it . Is that pretty close ? I guess . Wait a minute . You don 't want us to capture her alive so that we can study her ? Laura , I think this is strictly a search-and-destroy operation . Nobody ever asked me to find anything they didn 't want dead . I 'm sorry for you . Y eah , well ... thank you , Dan . I 'm sorry for her . Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention , please ? Welcome to Los Angeles , California . This is the terminal stop for the Desert Star . All passengers please disembark . [ Crying ] This is the final boarding call for train number 12 , the Coast Runner , to Santa Barbara , San Jose , San Francisco , Eugene , and Seattle . Something bad happened here . No shit . Crushed her larynx . She was afraid . She 's scared . She 's frightened . Hungry , too , by the looks of it . She 's been eating like a horse . Well , our girl is definitely not on a diet . She must be storing up calories for something . Any ideas ? Oh , my ... [ Coughs ] Well , that 's , uh ... that looks like some sort of ... chrysalis . Some kind of cocoon . What are we looking for , a giant moth ? Uh ... if that is a cocoon , she 'll be fully grown now . Fully grown . Maybe that 's how she got by our people . They were looking for a child . She is a child . It stinks in here . I 'm going outside . Get the conductor 's l.D. and credit card numbers on your computer . There 's no sign of them on the train . Let 's assume she took them with her . I 'll see to that . She kills if she feels threatened , and she has no remorse about it . None . [ Arden ] Of course , Los Angeles is perfect for her . It 's a city of the future . Anything goes . Totally mobile population . Everyone 's a stranger . Very little in this town is taboo or unacceptable . Whatever she does , no one 's going to notice . Y eah , well , whatever . So Los Angeles is where the battle 's going to be fought ... and won . You look very pretty . Do you have a hundred ? Here we are . You ought to be more careful with your money . Not everybody 's as honest as me . Are you foreign ? Do you speak English ? Yes . Here . You keep this . Oh , here . Let me take this . Be careful here . Yes . Watch your step . Our laboratory , Visitor Base One , is being moved to some empty virus research labs at the university . They 're moving our equipment as we speak . It 'll be operational by 8 : 00 . Check into your rooms . Everyone out front in 15 minutes . We 'll go on over . What exactly are we going to do ? Process the evidence we collected on the train . Couldn 't we try growing this creature with just its own DNA- - we make up a version without including ours this time so we can investigate its vulnerabilities ? That would be good . Like to know how it feels . This human life form could be a mask . If we could see it without the camouflage ... Then we 'd know what we were dealing with . [ Honks Horn ] Couple of bozos just ran out . I got a customer . Call you back . Y es , young lady , can I help you ? I want a room . 62 , including tax . That should just about cover the honeymoon suite . That should just about cover the honeymoon suite . [ Television Turns On ] Hi . Come here often ? What 's your sign ? Tired of brunette ? Change . Change the color of your hair . Color-tress . O.K. , I 've just increased the magnification . When I pierce the cell , the foreign DNA will be introduced . Shit . The camera 's just gone down . Um ... excuse me . Do you have a replacement camera ? We have a standby camera , but it 'll take time for the technician to replace it . This happens all the time . It 's a simple operation to replace it . Are you saying you can do it ? Well , yeah , sure , I can . I just need somebody to give me a hand . I don 't want technicians in there . This is classified . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . A man of action . I like that . That 's me . Can you get that one for me ? All right . Give me the camera . Something 's- - Something 's wrong . Christ , it 's started already . It 's started already . Get the top back on . What ? Get the top back on . Here you go . Must have penetrated the cell before the camera went down . What was that ? He dropped the bolt . Find the bolt . Get the top back on . I 'm looking , Fitch . Can they hear me in there ? Laura , Press , get the top back on . Then I 'm going to let you out . I think it fell through the grate . Can you lift up the grate ? It 's not going to work . This isn 't going anywhere . Press , you got to get the bolt out from under the grate . Can 't get to it . The floor 's welded down . Oh , my God . Press ... Oh , my God ! I 've never seen anything like this . I can 't let them out of the room . Press , look . Come on . Fitch , let us out of here ! Open the goddamn door ! Can 't let you out till I know what 's in there . You got to let them out . Open the fuckin ' door ! Let us out ! Tell me it 's going to stop growing , Dan . Let them out ! Open up the door ! Press ! Press ! What the fuck is that ? Laura , get to the other door ! Let her out , Fitch ! Can 't let her out , Press . I can 't do that . You motherfucker ! What 's wrong with you ? I can 't hold it . It 's breaking out . Let her out , Fitch ! I 'm going to burn it ! Get out of the way ! What is this thing ? If you can 't destroy it , I 'll burn the room . I have to burn the whole room . You got two minutes to kill the thing . Disconnect the gas line . Use it as a flamethrower . Past the table ! It 's under the table ! Aah ! Laura , watch out ! Where did it go ? It 's in the pipe . Open the door ! Shut up , Dan ! One minute remaining . Laura , it stopped moving . Think I killed it . It 's dead . Open the door . It 's dead , Fitch . Let them out . Oh , God . It 's not dead . It 's not dead . What are we going to do ? 30 seconds remaining . There 's not much time . Open the door ! You got to let them out . It might escape . I have to follow protocol . What protocol ? You didn 't tell them that before they went in there . Fitch , let them out . Fitch , let them out ! I have to follow protocol . Let them out , Fitch ! Go ! Get out of there ! 3 ... 2 ... 1 . I hope you realize I had no choice , but the protocol 's to burn the room in two minutes if anything went wrong . Attention all cars . Unit 4 should pick him up first unless he changes course . Call Unit 4 if you make contact . Where 's a good place to find a man ? There 's plenty of guys at the ld around the corner . You won 't have any trouble meeting somebody there . Thank you . Can 't miss it . Just look for the long line . Hey , I need your credit card for room incidentals- - Iong-distance calls , damage to the room , so forth . Credit card ? Zip-zap ? Plastic- - American Express , Visa , MasterCard ? There you go . Thanks . All right . Thank you . Oh , hey , wait a minute . Hey ! Hey ! You don 't want this falling into the wrong hands . No . Here 's Justin Crawl . Holds it in . [ Telephone Rings ] 18 : .42 left to go here . Yeah . The conductor 's stolen credit card has turned up at a motel in Hollywood . The van 's out front . Let 's go . You two . Enjoy yourself . You , legs , you 're in . Go on . I 'm down on my knees I 'm beggin ' you , please I 'm down on my knees I 'm beggin ' you , please I 'm down on my knees Hey , hey , where are you from ? I 'm foreign . You 're what ? I 'm foreign . Foreign , really ? Easy . Easy . I 've got a party to go to and no one to take me . I 'll take you . You will ? Yeah . I 'm going to go to the little girls ' room . You wait right here . I 'll be right back . I 'll be right here . What 's his name , Greg or something ? Whatever it takes , right ? Hey , all 's fair in love and war . Buddy . Aah ! Aah ! Can 't see much on that . Get this tape back to the lab . Enhance it . Let 's see if we can get a better look at her . She looks nice . Do you have any idea where she went ? I 'll find her . Wanted to know where she could meet a man . I suggested a club called the ld around the corner . Get the tape . I 've got a party to go to and no one to take me . Where is this party ? I don 't know . Aah ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . You can 't park there . Back that up . You can 't go in there . Hey , hey , hey , hey . What 's going on here ? Nobody leaves the club , and I mean nobody . There 's always some action in this part of town . [ Car Stereo Plays ] Blue-eyed blonde , black leggings , pink sweater , 5 ' 10 ' tall . Who did she leave with ? Blue-eyed blonde leaves with a guy , it 's hardly news around here . Name the top attractions . The regulars , no losers . We should assume he 's socially adept . We 're looking for a friendly guy , not an asshole . Robbie left with a blonde . That 's him . That 's him . Let me show you the rest of the house . I 'm still sweaty from that place . So crowded . [ Music Plays ] Like it ? Y es . I feel like a shower . You want one ? Tell you what . I 'm going to take one . Want to get in and take one later ? No problem . Take off your clothes . I want to see you . Very nice . Can you drive me back ? What are you talking about ? You knew what we came here for . I 've changed my mind . All right . You said no . It 's duly noted . Come here . I said I want to go . Too late . You 're not leaving . I said you 're not leaving . All right . That 's better . [ Shower Running ] What 's happening ? Kills a girl at the club , kills this guy . Well , I 'd say she fits the classic definition of a psychopath . She 's got nothing to inhibit her- - no moral sense , no social structure . Well , she wasn 't exactly smothered with a mother 's love or taught good manners . Know what I mean ? I asked what was happening . He did something to her . She was angry . She 'll kill if she feels threatened . She 'll kill anyone that gets in her way . Gets in her way of what ? Her life cycle . I think she 's trying to mate ... reproduce . So why did she kill the girl at the club ? Sexual competition . She 's pretty hard on the competition . Now she 's managed to mate . Doesn 't look like a successful mating to me . He 's still got his pants on . - She 's frustrated . - Who isn 't ? What is her problem ? He was here , she was here . Maybe she rejected him . She probably has some special kind of senses . Rats can sense disease or genetic damage in their potential mates . So we can test his body for any hereditary diseases , any defects that would have made him a loser , essentially . Needles . Maybe he was some kind of a doper or diabetic . Either way would have made him unacceptable . Excuse me . All right . Insulin . Diabetic . There you have it . She could have just walked out . Why did she have to kill him ? I guess he pissed her off . Some men don 't like rejection . They get insistent . Put an APB out on this guy 's car . We 'll go back to the motel . I want to check it out thoroughly . More docile and controllable , huh , Fitch ? What do you think , Dan ? What do I think ? I think she 'd want to be alone right now . I don 't think she 's going to want to come here with all these cars lined up out front . You 're assuming she could find her way back . She could . What is it ? Maybe menstrual blood . If she 's menstruating , she 's definitely capable of reproduction . Y es , I know . [ Starts Engine ] [ Car Stereo Plays ] [ Engine Sputtering ] Into my life Come and go with me Come into my life I got so much love to show you Come into my life Boy , I adore you [ Whistles ] Shit ! Oh , Jesus . Excuse me . Call the paramedic ! Anybody got a phone ? If your homeward commute takes you westbound on the Santa Monica Freeway , expect delays for up to one hour . The homeward drive will be slow for people heading to Malibu . The video enhancement is not all that great . How old do you think she is ? 20 ? 23 ? Her reproductive system should be fully developed . Her biological clock must be in hyperdrive . She wants to have a baby . If she manages to have a child , our problems have just started . If her offspring 's male and develops at the same rate as Sil , it could be capable of reproduction in six months . God knows how many females it could impregnate . Fitch . You see , when a predatory species is introduced into a closed ecological system , the extinction of the weaker species is inevitable . They found the murdered guy 's BMW . Ran out of gas in Santa Monica . And what is her name ? I don 't know her name . So who are you ? She didn 't have any l.D. on her . Thought I 'd come by to make sure she 's O.K. You think she 's got insurance ? I don 't know . Put it on my credit card for the time being . And you don 't know her name . Guys like you are hard to find . Get a lab workup on that , stat . Arrange to get her up to X ray . I want an X ray on this . It looks like a scapula fracture . Respiratory technician to CCU . Respiratory technician to CCU . Your sh- - Your shoulder . What 's going on here ? Doctor , we need you immediately . A child burn victim just came in . What is going on here ? Jesus Christ ! Did you see her shoulder ? Doctor , please . We need you immediately . You 're O.K. I 'm O.K. Well , I was sure you were seriously injured . I 'm O.K. You are . It 's a miracle . Can we go ? Did the doctor say you could go ? Yes . We 'll send somebody over there . A report 's come in . A doctor over at Parkbay Hospital called in with some weird story . We should check it out . Laura , Press , take a car . Check it out . Parkbay Hospital ? Y eah , Parkbay . She walked . She walked . She walked that way . Not too long ago . Got some fruit and cheese here . What is that ? What do you mean , the hot tub ? Hot tub . I love this place . It 's away from the traffic and the business and all the people . Sometimes it feels like you 're not in L.A. anymore . Here . We 'll immortalize the moment . Look at the camera . This girl literally reformed her bone structure . It 's her . Who checked her in ? I don 't know . Let 's find out . She had no insurance , so this guy put it on his own credit card . Here 's the file . John F. Carey . You haven 't got a driver 's license , home address , social security number , anything like that ? I only got an imprint of his credit card . That 's the only information I have . Can you give us a printout of whatever you 've got ? No problem . Want some candy ? All right , it 's an address in the Palisades , and he 's got a phone number . Tell Fitch where we 're headed , and try to get John Carey on the line . [ Opera Music Plays ] [ Telephone Rings ] Uh , I better get the phone . [ Ring ] I 've got his machine . Should I leave a message ? Y eah . Tell him he 's about to copulate with a creature from outer space . Copulate , huh ? Yeah . I like you . I know . It 's not too soon for us to be together . No , it 's not too soon . You don 't need these . Oh , hey , hey . That 's a little fast . Whoa ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoa ! Whoa . What 's the matter ? Take it easy . Just relax . There 's plenty of time . What is it ? Oh , no . I think someone 's at the door . Don 't go . Please . I want a baby . What ? Excuse me ? Let 's go around the side . [ Deep Breathing ] Aah ! Aah ! What happened ? A squirrel . It was a fucking squirrel . She was here . Yeah , she was . I want to make sure she 's not still here . Perhaps we should check the body for any evidence that they 've had sex . I used to be scared of the sight of blood . Now I guess I 'm getting used to it . Oh , yes . [ Beep ] Hey ! You 've got to help me ! Oh , my God . What 's the matter ? We found this in the living room . She liked him . Well , not enough . Can 't see any more on that than we did on the video monitor . He didn 't get a very good picture of her . There 's no evidence of semen in the water . Well , maybe she took it with . She hasn 't managed to mate . We- - We interrupted her . Y es , I think we did . Give me something I can use . What have you come up with lately , Fitch ? She 's not scared of us , that 's for sure . We 're all beat . We 'll go back to the hotel , get some rest . Tomorrow night ... we 'll go back to the club ... stake it out . No , she 's not stupid . She 's not going to repeat herself . There 's little point going back there . It provided such a poor specimen . I 'm not so sure . She 's been in this city two days . It 's what she knows . I 'd rather try the club than sit around the command center reminiscing about how close we got . She would make one excellent biological weapon if someone out there thought we were some kind of galactic weed that was going to spread through the universe . So what you 're saying is that she 's the cure , and we 're the disease . That 's well said . 'Baker , Laura . 1735 Meander Drive , Simi Valley , California . ' That 's you , right ? Last time I checked . What do you do for kicks out there in Simi Valley ? Oh ... pine for guys like you . That 's what I thought . So , anyone hungry ? Uh , no , thanks . I 'm beat . I 'm just going to try to get some sleep . Good night . Y eah . Good night . I 'll have something to eat with you . Thanks , Dan . [ Ding ] Do you ever have nightmares ? Y es . Please untie my hands . I wouldn 't hurt you . Please . I have them . I think they tell me who I am . Why are you doing this to me ? I don 't know why I 'm here . I don 't know who I am , who sent me . Do you ? No . Why do you think you 're here ? I don 't know . Please let me go . Please , please let me go . I wouldn 't hurt you . I promise . I wouldn 't hurt you . Yes , you would . You just don 't know it yet . No , I wouldn 't . Please . My hands are hurting me . Oh , hey , thank you . Thank you . [ Screaming ] Oh , my God ! [ Screaming ] Oh , my God ! No ! No ! [ Muffled Screams ] Take me by the hand Make me understand Just where are you from Laura and Press , they like each other . They just don 't like to show how they feel . What ? Laura and Press , they like each other . Yeah , whatever you say , Dan . It 's very smoky in here . I 'm going to go get a bit of air . I 'm going to lie down in the van . This is a complete waste of time . Don 't you get the feeling you 're on a wild-goose chase ? Y eah . Excuse me . Take all of me Take me Take all of me Aah ! Get out of here . This is my trash can . It 's you . Hey ! She 's here ! Hey ! Dan , is that her ? Yeah . Here . She 's over here . Get in the van ! Everybody get in the van ! They 're heading into the hills . We 'll need the helicopters . Yeah , we 're going up Nichols Canyon . Why don 't you try and block her at Mulholland ? [ Muffled Screaming ] Whoa ! Watch it ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Oh , my God . [ Honk ] [ Siren ] We blocked the road in both directions . The press is going ape-shit . We 've got to tell them something . Well , just don 't tell them the truth . I don 't buy her showing up at the club . Too convenient . Seeing is believing , or don 't you trust your eyes ? Get all these people back ! Fitch . Fitch , it doesn 't feel right . We found what looks like a severed thumb in the pocket of a door that got ripped off . She may have caught it trying to escape . The lab will determine if it 's hers . It will be genetically identifiable . It 's all over , everyone . Tomorrow you can go back to your lives . Congratulations on a job well done . Just like that , huh , Fitch ? I don 't think so . [ Telephone Rings ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Abducted Woman ] Hi , Chucklets . Leave me a message , O.K. ? And , Frank , I 'm going to dinner . Where are we meeting ? Bye , sweetie . Waiter . Well , I guess we won . We won . Science lost . I didn 't think we 'd get her this way , not that easy . Sounds like you 'll miss her . Yeah . I guess I will . I think I respected her . This has been a hellish job , but I 've really enjoyed working with you three . Since Uncle Sam is buying , why don 't we have another round ? Waiter ! I don 't- - I don 't drink , Arden . Don 't worry . Tonight you will . Do you want to dance ? Who , me ? Yeah , you . All right . O.K. If you don 't know me by now If you don 't know me by now You will never , never , never know me You 'll never know me ... I know you don 't have a family . Do you have a girlfriend in New York ? Oh , I guess I 've had a few , but they don 't hang around very long . I guess I keep too many secrets . You want to share one with me ? Right now ? Well , I know what you do , and it doesn 't scare me . Oh , really ? No . Well , it does most people . I wouldn 't want to never see you again . Hey ! Whoa , what are you- - I 'm sorry . I thought you were somebody else . You O.K. ? I thought it was Sil . I saw the blond hair . She 's dead . Tests on the thumb proved it was her . You got your tests . I got my gut . I don 't buy it . As long as you feel she 's out there , you got a mission . Maybe you don 't want this job to be over . Well , maybe not . So what ? Thanks for the dance . Good night . What do you call this ? It 's called a Long lsland iced tea . It 's got tea in it ? Nope . [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] Smells nice . Can I try some ? Help yourself . Does it work on your boyfriend ? Heh . Y eah . As a repellent . I think he 's in remarkably good shape for a man his age . One Long lsland iced tea . I like this cup- - these cups of tea . [ Arden ] Ha ha ha ! What ? That 's great . Ha ha ! What ? What ? Hey , give me one of those . I like these cups of tea , man . You guys , I 'm tired . I 'm going to go to bed . So ? She 's going to bed . I guess . She still , uh ... wants to see you , though . Maybe I 'll go find out if you 're right about that . Hate to be in this during an earthquake . Y eah . What floor do you want ? Uh , 10 , please . [ Sniffing ] I like your perfume . You do ? Thank you . Excuse me . I get out here . Good night . Y es ! Hi . Hi . Did you want something ? Maybe . Maybe ? Ooh ! [ Thump ] [ Thud ] Ha ha ha ! Oh ! Ooh ! Ha ha ha ! Hee hee hee ! [ Keys Jingling ] [ Knock On Door ] Housekeeping . Dan . Dan , those two over there . I bet they like unusual men like us . Women think I 'm strange . I don 't feel well . Don 't be silly . Just go over there and talk to them . I have to go . I think you should leave with me , O.K. ? I-I 'm going to stay for a while , actually . O.K. I 'll see you tomorrow . [ Knock Knock ] Housekeeping . [ Laughter ] Hi . Hi . I couldn 't help wondering , sitting over there , what two very intelligent , glamorous-looking women were doing without dates . My name 's Steven Arden , by the way . I teach comparative anthropology at Harvard . I lived in Boston for a year . Froze my butt off . Kind of cold in Boston . This is Bill and Tony . I forget your name . Give me those socks . Ha ha ha ! Stand up . Whoo . How 'd you get in here ? I stole the key . What ? I saw you downstairs , but you were with all those people , So I thought I 'd come up and wait . Whoa . This kind of thing doesn 't usually happen to me . I just want to be with you . Hmm ? You , uh ... Oh , yes . Y es . Oh , yes . Oh . What about protection ? She 's here . She 's here . Press ? Huh ? Someone 's at the door . [ Knocking ] Who 's there ? Who 's there ? Press , Laura . It 's Dan . I got to talk to you . Oh , Christ . What does he want ? What 's the problem , Dan ? I just got this terrible feeling . I just got this strange thought . Sil 's next door with Arden , Press . No , no , no , no , no . She 's dead . I got upset , so I went to his room . There 's somebody with him . Did you knock on the door ? Yeah . I don 't know what she 'll do . They 're making a lot of noise . They 're having sex . I know it 's Sil . I know it 's Sil . I know it . O.K. , I believe you . I 'm going to get dressed . Oh , my God . Ahh . Well , I enjoyed that immensely . I felt it . What ? It 's started . What 's started ? Life . Oh . Ha ha ha . My darling girl ... I know in some cultures , women believe they know the exact moment of conception , but- - Don 't you believe me ? Feel . Holy shit . [ Gurgling ] I hope you 're right about this , Dan . She 's headed for the basement ! We 'll take the stairs ! Laura , come with me ! Come on ! If she 's pregnant , we got to get to her before she gives birth . Oh , God . We don 't know what we 're dealing with here . She could have a dozen babies . She could lay a thousand eggs . Oh , God ... Did you see Arden ? Yeah , I did . That poor bastard . If they make it , we 'll have her trapped . The fire doors only open from inside at the bottom exit . Holy shit . The bitch went right through a steel door . Fitch ! Dan ! We 're in the garage ! She got past us ! You saw her ? She was gone before we got here . You saw her ! Look at the door . Which way did she go ? I don 't know . Where 's Press ? Down that tunnel . [ Dan ] She kills if she feels threatened . She kills if she feels threatened . She must have come through here . She went down here . There 's no other way . Yeah . She 's down there . Let 's go . Stand back . I 'll clear it out . Which way do you think she went , Dan ? I don 't know . I 'm not sure . She 's here . Think , for Christ 's sake ! You 're supposed to have extrasensory powers . Which way did she go ? Which way did she go , Dan ? Which way did she go ? I don 't know . Which way did she go ? I think she went that way . You think ? That 's good enough for me . You think she did , but you don 't fucking know , do you ? You don 't fucking know . I 'm going this way . You come with me . Come with me , Dan ! I think- - I think she went this way . Dan ? Dan ? Aah ! Fitch ! Fitch ! Dan ? What happened ? [ Laura ] Ohh ! I can feel her . She 's that way . She 's that way . I never thought I 'd want to kill something . I never thought I 'd want to kill something . Hey . It 's this way . It 's back here . Hey , she went in here . This must have opened up during the earthquake . O.K. , stand back . Aah ! Aarrrh ! [ Gurgling ] Rarhh ! [ Coughing ] [ Press ] Wow . [ Laura ] Is that oil ? Looks like it . I 'm going to go on back through there and see if I can flush her out . If she comes back through here , let her have it . Dan ? Dan ? Dan ? What is it ? I don 't know . I don 't know . [ Cooing ] Dan . O.K. It 's O.K. Nobody 's going to hurt you . You come here . Come on . Come on . I got ya . Raaah ! Aah ! Press , something 's happened to Dan ! It 's O.K. Whoa ! Shit ! Dan ? Dan ? I 'm stuck ! Help ! I need your help . I 'm stuck ! Oh . Raaah ! Raaarrh ! Press ! Dan , you 've got to hang on . Raaah ! Press ! Dan , hang on ! Press ! Don 't fall ! Don 't fall ! Aaaaah ! N-n-no . Hang on , Dan ! Hang on ! I got you ! That 's it . I got you , Dan . Hang on . Raaah ! [ Press ] Hang on ! Hang on , Dan ! Get rid of her , Press ! Duck your head ! Let go , you motherfucker . I got you . Hold on . I got you . I thought I was dead . I thought you drank your last Long lsland iced tea there , Dan . Yeah . I thought we all had . Hey ... you O.K. ? Yeah , I 'm O.K. My pants are a little messed up , but I 'm O.K. She was half us , half something else . I wonder which was the predatory half . The dead half . Let 's get the hell out of here . Ahh ! I never thought I 'd be so happy to be back in a sewer . Raaah !

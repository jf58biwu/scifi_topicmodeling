 ( electrical buzzing ) ( buzzing ) ( woman gasping ) ( gasping ) ( machine starts ) Hello ? Anyone here ? Hello . ( roaring static ) ( electronic hissing ) ( screams ) ( electrical buzz ) Numbers ... where 's the goddamn numbers ? There 's something ... Oh shit . I mean , they 're my numbers ... Damn ! Don 't I at least get a shot with my numbers , you stupid fucks ? ! I want a chance ! I want a chance like everyone else . ( woman screaming ) Oh my God . Oh , you bastards . Our Father Which art in heaven , hallowed be Thy name . Thy kingdom come , Thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven . Give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors . Lead us not into temptation ... Lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . For Thine ... is the kingdom ... and the power ... and the glory , forever and ever . Amen . ( electronic hissing ) Hello ? Are you all right ? Can you hear me ? Are you hurt ? ( man growling ) ( woman screaming ) Don 't move . Don 't make a sound . I said , " Don 't move . " Are you alone ? Blink once for yes , twice for no . Is there anyone else in the other room ? All right . All right . I 'm going to release you . But I can take you down again , as quick as the first time . So don 't scream , understand ? Once for yes , twice for no . Are you alone ? All right . All right . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? How many rooms have you been in ? What is this place ? Man : I don 't know . You tell me , how many rooms you 've been in ? I don 't know , five or six . What about you ? Uh ... this is my third . You sure you didn 't see anyone else ? No . Have you ? No . So who are you ? Who are you ? ( loud static ) What the fuck are those noises ? Relax . This is just for show . Pretend that you 're scared . Should be easy . All right . Get down here now , or she 's dead . Some hero . I have that effect on men . Glad to see you haven 't lost your sense of humor . ( electronic hissing ) - Is this really necessary ? - Just hang on . Woman : Isn 't that the same ... Man : Yes . ( electronic hissing ) Man : Hey ! Come back ! ( electronic hissing ) Wait . Man : Jesus Christ . Hey ! Wait ! Where the fuck do you think you 're going ? This guy sure moves quickly . He 's just gone . Maybe something made him go , maybe you should come back . This place is awful . Girl : Please don 't hurt me . Woman : Don 't be frightened . Don 't worry . There 's nobody else here . Just me . I 'm Kate . What 's your name ? Sasha . That 's a beautiful name . Don 't worry . Everything 's going to be all right , okay ? Do you understand me ? I 'm just blind , not retarded . ( electronic hissing ) ( struggling ) Finally . I was beginning to wonder if I was the only one in here . I kept hoping I would find some other people . I 've been wondering around these rooms for hours . Stay away from me ! No one 's going to hurt you . Well , certainly not . No . No . I come in peace , young lady . I 'm Jerry . This is Sasha . She 's blind . And she 's very scared . What a bummer , to be blind in this place . Do you know what this place is ? No . No . No . I don 't suppose , either of you two could let me know what we 're doing in here ? No . Oh ... Jerry Whitehall . Kate Filmore . Kate : What are you doing ? I 'm marking the rooms . This is the fourth room you 've been in ? Yeah . I thought you said you 've been wandering these rooms for hours . Yeah . That 's the weird thing isn 't it ? Each one of these rooms , has six of these doors , or portals . But no matter how many portals I go through , I always wound up in the same three rooms . Until now . It 's as if the rooms were moving around or something . Yeah . But I don 't feel any motion , do you ? No . It 's just so strange . I ran into this guy ... ( rumbling ) Oh no . It 's getting closer ! - What is ? - I don 't know . Something 's coming after us , and I don 't think it likes us . I don 't hear any people . I think it 's just motors . He wants us dead . We have to get out of here right now . Any suggestion on which way to go next ? Your guess is as good as mine . I don 't know . Please , we have to move ! Uh ... here . Okay . Sasha , we 're going to have to climb a bit of a ladder . Hold on to me . - Move quickly . - Get me out of here ! Man : Help ! - Help me ! - Jerry : Oh God ! There 's a guy hanging . I can 't hold him much longer ! - Jerry : Okay . I 'm coming . - Kate : Oh my God . Sasha : What 's happening ? Man : Hurry ! Jerry : Hang on . Hang on . Hang on . Man : Grab his ... Jerry : I 'm coming . I 'm coming . Here ... Good girl . Good girl . Sasha , you 're going to be okay . Just stay here . You 're going to be okay . ( electronic hissing ) There you are . You 've found some friends , huh ? Help me get him down . Fantastic . - Man : Give me some space . - Kate : I 'm here . - Man : I can grab his legs . - Jerry : I 'm loosening the belt . Man : All right . All right . I got him . I 'm losing it . Ready , you got it ? - Man : Yeah . - Hurry . There it goes . I know you want a cigarette , but not yet . - Jerry : Slowly . Easy . - Kate : I 've got his legs . Kate : Lean him up against this wall . Okay . Watch his head . That 's it . Just make sure he 's upright . He 's alive . He 's breathing . Man : Good . He 's military . Colonel Thomas H. Maguire , Department of Defense , Jesus Christ . He 's Pentagon , hi-tech liaison . You ... how the hell would you know ? A buddy of mine 's doing 10 - 20 upstate for cracking the mainframe on the Pentagon two years ago . I helped him write the code . Maybe that 's why I 'm in here . You know for sure we 're in prison ? - I 'm assuming ... - You know what they say . ( laughing ) Thanks . That 's helpful . Jerry Whitehall . Thanks . Simon Grady . That 's Kate . Sasha . I 'm sorry . I didn 't get your name . Max Reisler . - Thanks . - Kate : Sasha ... Sasha ... Jerry , could you ... Jerry : Sure , of course . Simon : Come on , sit him up . Jerry : Let 's get you sitting up straight here . Sasha , you okay ? This man 's been beaten badly . He 's been tortured . Look at his hand . - Cigarette burns . - Jesus . Sasha : They 're coming for us next . Don 't you worry . I won 't let anyone hurt you . I hope it 's that easy , Kate . There 's nothing in here . What do you think ? I figure he knows something he didn 't want anyone to know . That 's usually why people are tortured . Max : How do you know , Mr. Cigarette Burns ? What are you , an expert ? As a matter of fact , you weedy little shit ... ( electronic hissing ) Sasha : They 're coming ! They 're coming ! They 're coming . They 're coming . ( Simon yelps ) Oh , hello . Do you know where the showers are ? I seem to be lost , again . I always get lost in this gym . I don 't know why my daughter-in-law insists on bringing me here . It 's all the way across town . Jerry and Simon : Whoa . Simon : Watch your step . Watch your step . Old lady : Thank you , dear . Oh my goodness . I 'm afraid I can 't help you with the showers . I 'm Jerry . You 're not little Jerry Reisback , are you ? No . Thank goodness . He 's my paperboy , and I owe him $ 10 . Right . Well , this is Simon . Kate and Sasha . Hello . And uh ... Max . Max . - Old Lady : Max . - Jerry : And you are ? I 'm Mrs. Paley . How do you do Mrs. Paley ? You don 't happen to know why you 're here , do you ? Oh dear . I was never very good at philosophy . ( Sasha giggling ) Do any of us know what 's going on here ? Sorry . I 've been trying to get a handle on the configuration of these rooms . Jerry : All I can say is ... Simon : They just don 't make any sense . Jerry : That 's right . They sure don 't . Max : It 's as if the rooms are moving around very quickly . Jerry : There 's got to be some kind of logic to it . These rooms just seem to repeat . You go in one direction , the room just loops back on itself . ( electronic hissing ) It 's getting closer . Sasha , do you know what it is ? Not really . But I can hear it . All the time , even when you don 't . And it sounds it feels wrong . Mrs. Paley : Maybe we 're in hell . All right , let 's get some real answers . His answer was suicide . Not exactly a comforting thought . Soldier , up on your feet . Careful , he 's hurt . Come on , pumpkin , up you come . Stop it . He 's in serious condition . Stop it . Listen to me , sweetheart ... I 'm not your sweetheart , asshole . All right . This man 's been tortured . You want to be next when they come for us ? Who exactly are they ? Well , I 'm going to find out . Come on . Stop it . Stop it . ( moaning ) Kate : Are you trying to kill us ? It 's not going to help us if he dies , you know ? Jerry : You 've got no information whatsoever . - It 's here . - Jerry : Jesus ... what the fuck ? ! Simon : Come on . He 's conscious . Kate : Sit him up . Sit him up . Simon : Come on , soldier . Talk to me , soldier . Talk to me . What 's going on here ? Colonel : Are you speaking to me ? Yes . Jesus Christ . Yes . Just tell me , how do we get out of here ? I don 't know . You figure out the code , you get out . The first one had rules ... The first one ? What are you talking about ? Leave him alone . He 's delirious . He knows something , all right ? I 'll carry him myself , just ... Colonel : The first one had numbers ... Simon : What do you mean , " the first one " ? - Kate : Let him go . - Max : I 'm out of here . ( chattering ) ( Mrs. Paley whimpers ) Kate : Oh my God . Are you okay ? Did you hit your head ? Yeah . I slipped . It 's a wall . It wiggled . - Kate : You sure you 're okay ... - Max : Look . There it goes again . Jerry : That ... that ... that ... That 's ... that 's ... I don 't know . No ! Max : Holy fuck . What is that ? Simon : I don 't know . But I don 't think we should stick around to find out . - Come on , let 's go . - Jerry : Come on . Kate : Come on , Sasha , I 'm here . I 'm right behind you , honey . Jerry : Hurry , let 's go ! Easy , easy ... Simon : For Christ 's sake . Kate : What the ... Jerry : Come on . There you go . - Kate : Grab right there . - Sasha : Where are you ? Simon : Come on , Colonel . It 's time for us to go . I 'm not done with you yet . Colonel : I 'm not going . What did you do that for ? I 'm not going anywhere soon . Well , fuck you . Come on , Kate . Let 's get out of here . Come on , where 's the key ? Do you have the key ? Colonel : You mean this ? Kate : Yeah . No . What did you do that for ? You don 't honestly think you can escape ? We have to try . Oh my God . This is gonna hurt . ( Simon yelling ) Kate , get the hell up here ! No . I 'm not leaving without him . For God 's sake , he 's a dead man . Move . Colonel : God . Simon : There 's no time left . Let 's go . ( Kate yelling ) ( Colonel yelling ) Oh my God . There 's got to be a way . Get the ... get the hell out of there . - Oh my God . - Simon : Leave him , he 's dead . ( Colonel screaming ) Oh my God . ( Colonel screaming continues ) Kate : Let me go . ( Colonel screaming ) Kate : Let me go . It 's still coming . Come on . So what the hell happened back there ? I don 't know . Mrs. Paley : Hello . And where did you come from ? What 's your name ? I 'm ... I 'm Kate . Don 't you remember me ? I 'm Mrs. Paley . The Colonel was our only link to this place . Maybe not . I designed the door panels in here . The touch sensors . What ? I was freelancing for a subcontractor , I ... You didn 't think this was worth mentioning before ? I signed a confidentiality ... Given our current situation , I 'd say it 's null and void . - Jesus Christ ! - The legal ... What the hell is this place ? I don 't know . You don 't think the guy that makes the toilets in the space shuttle , gets to see the plans for the rest of it ? You must have had some idea what they were building . It was experimental . It was a prototype . For what ? - Jerry : I 'm not sure . - Simon : For what ? ! Jerry : Leading-edge stuff . There were rumors ... What kind of rumors , Jerry ? What rumors ? Quantum teleportation . Pardon ? They were just rumors . You mean , like ... " Beam me up , Scotty " ? Kate : Okay . Now this is getting ridiculous . What do you know , Jerry ? Nothing . - Simon : You 're lying . - Jerry : Why would I lie ? Because both you and the Colonel work for them . Them ? Who the hell are " them " anyway ? What ? The government ? The mafia ? Aliens ? Mrs. Paley : Oh my goodness . It 's a tesseract . Jerry : Christ , she 's losing it . Isn 't it beautiful ? Kate : Isn 't what beautiful , Mrs. Paley ? Holy shit . If you look at it from just the right angle ... What did you call it again , Mrs. Paley ? It 's a tesseract , sweetheart . Tesseract ? Tesseract . It 's ... It 's a tesseract . How do you know it 's a tesser ... act , or whatever you call it ? Is the second act beginning already ? We should be getting back to our seats . Excuse me . Kate : Yeah . Is she for real ? ( Jerry laughs ) A tesseract , Holy Christ , of course . A tesseract . ( laughing ) Jerry , you okay ? Yeah , yeah . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . It 's been staring at us in the face the whole time . ( laughing ) Maybe you could share with the rest of the class . Oh . Of course . A tesseract ... it 's another name for a hypercube . A what ? A hypercube ... a four-dimensional cube . Four dimensions ? All the elements are there . Rooms repeating . Rooms folding in on themselves . Teleportation . It could all very well add up . Look . Here . See ? Let 's call one dimension , length , and represent that with a simple line . Now , two dimensions are length and width , which can be represented by a single square . Now if we extend that square , one more dimension ... we get ... a cube , which has three dimensions . Length , width , and depth . Come on , we 've all passed the eighth grade . Hush . Jerry : Here 's the really funky part . ( nervous laughter ) If you take this cube , and extend it one more dimension , we get ... Kate : A tesseract . Max : I thought time was considered to be the fourth dimension . Jerry : Sure . That 's one idea . But what if you have a fourth spatial dimension ? - Max : There 's no such thing . - Simon : Why don 't you shut up ? Okay . Okay . Let 's just say that we are in this hyper ... - Jerry : Cube . - Kate : Cube . Whatever . Does this diagram show us how to get out ? Well , uh ... no . A hypercube isn 't supposed to be real . It 's just a theoretical construct . Oh . Well that makes me feel better . Is there a theory on how we might get out of this ... theoretical construct ? I don 't know . Mrs. Paley : Don 't worry , dear . It 's just a matter of time . That 's so much clearer . Thank you . Max : Great . Anyway ... here 's my theory for what it 's worth : We are all ... unwilling participants ... in a game show , and are being videotaped as we speak . Although I don 't condone forcible abduction of innocent people , we can take comfort in the fact that once the show airs , we 'll be able to parlay this into lucrative sponsorship deals . Kate : Okay , Max . And what 's the object of this game show ? Hmm ... I don 't know . To get out alive ? Simon : I think we should make a map . I don 't think a map is really going to help us . Look at that . That wasn 't there a minute ago . Did you write that ? No . I left my wings at home . I just marked this room as 10 before it . Somebody 's been here before us . Thanks . A really large someone . Why go through the trouble of writing it on the ceiling ? 60,659 rooms ? Christ . This place must be huge . Mrs Paley : Oh yes , yes . In a hypercube , there could be 60 million rooms . She could be right . There 's a comforting thought . ( electronic hissing ) What the hell are you doing ? Yowza . The ratings on this show just doubled . Simon : What do you see ? Max : A girl . Simon : Oh Jesus . Max : I 'm going in . - I think I 'm going to puke . - Simon : You all right ? Okay . I just ... whoa ... All : Hey . Hey . Hey . - Simon : Get back here . - Kate : What 's happening ? - Jerry : What 's going on ? - Max : Help ! Simon : Try to give me your hand . - Max : Help me ! - Simon : You okay ? Kate : What the hell is going on in there ? Simon : Max , don 't be an idiot . - Jerry : Come on back . - Max : No , it 's okay . - The gravity shifted . - Max : She needs help , - she may be hurt . - Wow . Are we going in there or what ? Maybe she knows something . What about our ... less agile members ? I have an idea . ( electronic hissing ) Hello . Kate : Whoa . I 'm all right . Max : Miss ? Hey , Miss . Hey . Wake up . She 's on her way . I guess it 's time for plan B. Give her mouth-to-mouth and see if it works . Think I should ? Oh , very funny . ( woman muttering ) Hi . What 's wrong ? What the hell ? Where am I ? That 's the million dollar question . ( laughing ) Does she have to keep cackling like that ? Come on , let 's get this over with . All right . This is going to be some kind of ... Yeah , Mrs. Paley . Just keep laughing there . This is more fun than I 've had since my thirteenth birthday . Glad somebody is having fun . This reminds me of that rope swing we used to have at home . For God 's sake , Mrs. Paley , this isn 't a game ! Come on . Come on down . Simon , you guys , keep her steady . All right , all right . Come on . Okay . And you 're down . That 's good . Simon : It 's okay . She 's down . - Mrs. Paley : We 've landed . - Kate : Yeah . Simon : It 's your turn , you 'll have to climb around the sides . Mrs. Paley : Well , this is a lot like the other ones , isn 't it ? Simon : Christ . This is going to be fun . Hello there . I 'm Mrs. Paley . Who the hell are you people ? ! Well ... I 'm Kate , and this is Mrs. Paley . And I am Julia . And this is ... Hey . Is this your jacket ? No . Well then how did I ... I must have had more to drink last night than I thought . There 's nothing in here . How the hell did I get here ? Have we been kidnapped ? That 's a really good question . Does anyone remember how we got here ? Last thing I remember was going to sleep . Where ? In my bed . Where do you live ? Lincoln , Nebraska . Kate , I am a healthy , married , male white engineer , who enjoys reading horror novels and eating chocolate ice cream , as well as climbing around psycho-jungle-gyms . Okay . I remember driving home from Maine State Hospital . It was late , and I just wanted to get home , I 've been working long hours . I 'm a psychotherapist . Simon . New Haven . I was out for a drink . What do you do ? A consultant . Management consultant . Max : Yeah , right . And I 'm Santa Claus . Okay , Max . How about you ? I live in Palo Alto . I design computer games . The last thing I remember , I fell asleep on my keyboard . Sasha . And where do you live ? New Mexico . I was doing my homework in the kitchen , like I always do . Nothing ever happens to me . The last thing I remember ... is taking the dog for a walk . Julia ? I was at an after party for a premiere in Santa Monica . Are you an actress ? No . No , I 'm an attorney . Let 's just say if I was kidnapped it was for the ransom . So we 've got Silicon Valley , Connecticut , Nebraska , Hollywood , Maine . Mrs. Paley , where exactly do you live ? In that high-rise at the corner of Riverside and 94th . Could you give me a lift home , dear ? I seem to have lost my daughter-in-law . Ignorance is bliss . This doesn 't make any sense . Simon : Yeah , well ... I think they probably flew us here . Drugged us and flew us out here in private or military jets . That 's what I think . - Max : Where is here ? - Simon : I don 't know . Your guess is as good as mine . Jerry : They could have built an hypercube structure anywhere . And if this thing really does fold space , we could be literately anywhere . What the hell ... What ? Here is that number again . 6-0-6-5-9 This can 't be the same room . Jesus ! It 's not , because now they 're in a string of other numbers . There just can 't be that many rooms . Maybe they are not room numbers . Maybe somebody else figured something out . We are definitely not alone . Check this out . What is it ? What 's happening ? Julia , is that your watch ? No . No , it 's mine . It ... Well , this is bizarre . Max : What , somebody else uses a watch just like yours ? Somebody is playing games with us . Shit ... look ... this is the watch that my wife gave me on my 40th . See ? This is the watch we 've just found . Maybe it 's your game that we are playing , Jerry . You designed the doors , your watch . What 's next ? - No , I ... - For the love of God , Mrs. Paley ... Mrs. Paley , please don 't . Oh , my goodness , I think he 's still alive . - Mrs. Paley , please . - Simon : Get her down . Easy , careful . Max : Is somebody in there ? - Simon : What do you see ? - Kate : Jerry ? Oh , God . There 's a guy down here . Oh ! - The gravity 's shifting . - Simon : What 's happening ? You okay ? Are you all right ? Kate : Simon , what 's going on ? My God . Hey , hey , fellow . Oh , Jesus . - Be careful . - Ugh ! - Is he alive ? - I don 't think so . - Let 's roll him over . - Jerry : Yeah , yeah ... Jerry : Oh God , is he ripe . What ... what is that ? Oh ! It looks pretty dead to me . Mrs. Paley : I hope he 's still alive . He 's been here for a while , Mrs. Paley . Mrs. Paley : Oh , poor man . Who do you think wrote these numbers ? He must have written them himself , It 's all upside down . It 's the same writing as those numbers we keep seeing . Oh , no ! It 's poor Dr. Rosenzweig . You know him ? He 'll never get his Nobel Prize now . - Who the hell is he ? - Max : Holy Christ ... Phil Rosenzweig . Last year he was the leading theoretical physicist in his field . - Which was ? - Jerry : Quantum chaos . Oh God , Phil Rosenzweig . I read his book ... ( gasps ) ( all scream ) ( exhales ) - Simon : Oh Jesus . - Kate : Oh my God . Simon : Is he ... ? Kate , is he ... ? - Yeah , he 's gone . - You are positive ? Uh-huh . Sasha : Somebody ... ? I 'm here , Sasha . Got you . Does anyone understand these numbers ? What was he writing ? Beats me . May be he was trying to calculate his way out of here . Looks like he ran out of time . How did old Mrs. Paley know him ? - I don 't know . - Hey , look . More numbers . Jerry : Same handwriting . Max : The question is , did he solve it before he died ? ( slams , yells ) God . She 's okay . Are you okay ? He must have finished it here . Look , there it is again ... 6-0-6-5-9 . Max : How does that get us out of here ? - It 's got to mean something . - Yeah , but what ? I don 't know , but we better remember it . You know , I wonder if is he 's got a ... Max : What are you doing ? That 's disgusting . Found a pen . Hope you have better luck than he did . Mrs. Paley : Oh no , this can 't be happening . Oh dear . Oh dear , just wait . Oh , I 'm such an idiot . Oh , no . Wait a minute . She 's gonna drive me insane . Mrs. Paley : Oh , it was right here . - What is it , Mrs. Paley ? - Mrs. Paley : Izon , where are you ? I 'm such an idiot . - Did she say Izon ? - Mrs. Paley : Izon , where are you ? You come back here this instant . Who are you looking for Mrs. Paley ? Have you seen my dog ? He 's a darling little Shi-Tzu . Darn it . ( gasps ) Her dog 's name is " Izon " ? That 's weird . I thought Izon was a ... Simon and Jerry : A weapons manufacturer . Yes . ( Mrs. Paley sniffles ) And you guys would know that because ... I read the papers . - Julia : Mrs. Paley ... - Mrs. Paley : Poor puppy ... Mrs. Paley , are you sure you didn 't leave the dog at home ? No . He was right here . I 'm such an idiot . Simon : This breaks my heart . Mrs. Paley ... Mrs. Paley , what do you do for living ? Oh , nothing . I 'm retired . I shouldn 't have let him off the leash . Before you retired , what did you do ? Nothing very exciting . I was a theoretical mathematician . Where did you work ? Oh , my head hurts . At Skippy Research Affiliates ... what do they called it ? A think-tank in Washington state . She worked for Skippy Research Affiliates and her dog 's name was Izon ? - Mrs. Paley ? - Hmm ? Is it possible that you worked for Izon Research Affiliates and your dog 's name is Skippy ? How did you know where I worked ? Oh , God . She worked for a weapons manufacturer ? She 's a good friend of our Nobel wanna-be . I don 't think we should trust Mrs. Funnyfarm . I 'm not crazy , and I 'm not hard of hearing either . I told you no one would believe me . Simon : Mrs. Paley , what sort of research did you do at Izon ? General , I will not be party to this insanity ! I 'm not a general . I don 't care what Alex Trusk says . It 's impossible . And what 's more , it 's inhuman . - Who 's Alex ? - Max : Did she say Alex Trusk ? Oh Christ . We 're dead . Jerry : This is really getting ridiculous . Who 's Alex Trusk ? Alex Trusk ? Hacker extraordinare ? He 's a legend . This is exactly the kind of twisted maze he 'd create . Alex Trusk doesn 't even exist . Some things should never be created . They exist for theoretical purposes only . It would never last . Can 't you understand that ? Okay , you 're a shrink . Can you tell me what the hell 's happening ? I ... umm ... I 'd say that seeing the dead man triggered some sort of emotional response . Flashbacks , post-traumatic stress ... So she is connected to this , yeah ? Mrs. Paley : Skippy ... Ooh , I think I hear him . Skippy ? Mrs. Paley , Mrs. Paley , don 't ... Skippy ? Mrs. Paley . ( electronic hissing ) ( hissing continues ) Oh my . Help me , please . ( gasps ) ( stabbing ) Uh , uh . No , don 't trust the old cunt . She lied about everything . ( screaming ) ( locking , yelling ) ( yelling continues ) What a ... Jesus . ( yelling continues ) Sasha : What just happened ? It took my head , man . I lost my fucking head ! Paley opened ... the portal ... ( all talking ) Wait , wait , I have an idea . I think we 're all tired . We need to calm down , everybody . Hold it . Wait a minute ! ( whistles ) I have an idea . Let me guess , you designed the floor too . You better have a really good fucking explanation , Jerry . I know what just happened there was a little ... shocking , but it actually makes total sense if we 're ... in a really multi-dimensional quantum environment . Julia : English , please . One fundamental idea of a quantum universe , is that parallel realities can actually exist simultaneously . How do you know that , Jerry ? All you designed were the door panels ! I read it in Rosenzweig book , it was a big part of this theory . What if whoever designed this stinking thing somehow managed to create a place where parallel realities can crossover like that ? So you are saying we just saw Simon and Mrs. Paley - in a parallel universe ? - Yes , yes ! Stop it ! A universe where things turn out a little differently . - Fuck . - Simon : Uh , please . Think about it , think about it . A few minutes before , - when you found the watch , - Yeah . And we realized that somebody else had been marking numbers in the rooms , right ? That 's when I thought maybe we should leave markers behind , in case we doubled back and got side-tracked . Things like a piece of clothing or jewelry . I think what a pity it would be to leave my watch . But I would do it if I had to . You 're saying that in an alternate reality we 'd already gotten ourselves into such trouble that you decided that is okay to leave your watch ? - Yes ! - For crying out loud ! What a load of crap ! There 's got to be a logical explanation . What would you think that is ? This is just an optical illusion or something ? Yeah , sure . Why not ? Julia : Finally , yeah . A sane idea . Kate : Oh , that 's a sane idea . Jerry : All right . If Max is right , why don 't you go and open that door ? - Simon : Oh , come on . - Jerry : Have a look . Max : Excuse me ? If you 're so sure it 's an optical illusion , open the door and have a look . You might want to stand to the side , in case that thing ... Fuck off , Jerry ! Simon : Okay , hold it ! All right ? Don 't open it . Say Jerry 's right , I think all of this is a hoax , okay ? I think Jerry 's either full of shit or part of this experiment . - Jerry : Simon , I never ... - Simon : Shut the fuck up ! I 'm agreeing with you , Max . I think we 're all pumped so full of LSD and I think we 're hidden in some CIA hospital in Area 51 , or whatever . But let 's just say , on the off - chance that Jerry is actually right . Then what happens if whatever the fuck it was in there that killed the guy , killed me , what happens if that fucking thing gets in here ? ! What happens then ? ! You 're all crazy . ( knife snicks ) Max : Hey , man , what are you doing ? Just don 't fucking open the door . What are you so scared of anyway ? I just saw my fucking head taken off by something or other . How 's that for starters ? Jerry : Where did you get that knife ? It 's mine . I collect knives . Max : He had it when I first saw him . - Kate : He sure did . - Jerry : That 's convenient . He 's the only guy with a knife here , if anyone was a part of the experiment ... maybe you . I know ! I know ! I 've got it ! I 've got it ! ( laughing ) Why don 't we all just get some ice cream and everyone will feel a lot better about everything ? ( evil laughing ) You 're funny , Mrs. Paley . You really are a funny old lady . You 're also cute and senile . You leave her alone , she doesn 't understand . All right , she 's already admitted working for Izon , one of the most powerful weapons manufacturers in the world . She recognized the figures on the wall , and she knew the dead guy . No . Maybe my alter ego wasn 't all that wrong . Maybe we shouldn 't trust dear old Mrs. Paley . Sasha : Maybe you 're the one we shouldn 't trust . Simon : I beg your pardon ? Maybe you 're the one we shouldn 't trust . Oh . I 'm going to ignore that , little girl , because you 're a cripple . I think we should keep moving , huh ? After you . ( electronic hissing ) Sasha : Kate , I 'm really thirsty . Me too , sweetheart . Me too . Mrs. Paley : I 'm exhausted . Are we there yet ? Jerry : Come on , Mrs. Paley . Just hold on a little longer . Kate : Who 's this Alex Trusk person ? Max : Are you kidding ? He programmed the virus that crashed the Tokyo stock exchange two years ago . He 's the one that broke into the Air Traffic Control Grid , and crashed those two Air Force jets in Nevada to protest military spending . Jerry : You forgot the one about Alex Trusk being the first genetically engineered superhuman , bred in a test tube , who now lives and walks amongst us . Kate : That sounds a bit far-fetched . Jerry : Don 't worry . Alex Trusk is a conspiracy theorist 's wet dream . He doesn 't exist . Max : Fine . Just keep fooling yourself . Simon : Would you people just shut up and keep moving ? Julia : Do you really believe this stuff about parallel universes ? Kate : If you asked me yesterday , I 'd say no . But this place changes your perception about what 's possible . Look , let 's just keep this between us for now . Yeah . Okay . Here 's the deal . I 'm a private investigator . I 'm on a case , missing persons . Given our current situation , this counts as irony . You 're right . I think they stuck me in here because of her ... Becky Young . They 've emptied my pockets except for my knife and this . Maybe it 's a message or a warning . Here 's the kicker . Guess who she worked for ? Izon ? Sasha : Kate . Kate . Kate , you have to wake up , there 's ... Kate : What is it ? What 's wrong ? There 's something here . Do you see anything ? You 're probably just dreaming or some ... Whoa . There is ... there is something . Simon : What the hell is that ? Kate . Kate , what do you see ? It 's a square . It 's just floating . Max : What is it ? Mrs. Paley : It 's beautiful . Simon : You recognize this too , Mrs. Paley ? Mrs. Paley : Well , not exactly ... - Sasha : What just happened ? - Now there 's two . Jerry : It 's multiplying . - Mrs. Paley : Oh my God ... - Julia : Maybe it 's the way out . Everyone : Oh . Wow . Max : If we 're drunk , I wanna know what this stuff is . Kate : Maybe that 's what a four-dimensional object looks like . Simon : If that 's the way out , how do we use it ? I hate it . It sounds wrong . It 's stunning . The math of it . It 's a perfect quadrangular oscillation . It 's moving . Mrs. Paley , no ! ( screaming ) Ahh . Simon : Get the fuck out of the way ! Jerry , you 're hurt . No . I 'm okay . Max : Look out . Stay low . Whoa ! Go on . Kate : Come on , Mrs. Paley . It 's time to go . Over here . It looks safe . - Don 't stare at it . Go . - Max : It 's coming back . Come on , Max . Max : Go , Julia . Go . - I want to get it . - No . We 've got to go . Oh my God . Go . Go up the stairs . Kate : Come on , Mrs. Paley . Keep going ... ( Sasha screaming ) Kate ! Sasha . ( screaming ) Jerry . - Oh Jesus ! - No . - Sasha . - No . Just don 't do it . - Just get in here . - What the fuck are you doing ? Sasha : Kate ! She 's gone . You want to end up like Jerry ? - Sasha . - Kate ! Sasha : Kate , I 'm here . Kate . You 're a dead woman . Oh ... oh Jesus . Sasha . Kate , help . - Kate , help ! - I 'm coming to get you . Help me ! Drop to the ground , Sasha . Now . Help me . Okay , Sasha . Now ... uh ... I can see you , Sasha . Flatten yourself against the wall , on the ground . - Crawl towards me . - No . I can 't . I 'm scared . You 've gotta move , or I can 't come and get you . Move towards me . No . Stop , Sasha ! Don 't , Sasha . Get down . Damn it , Kate , what do you want me to do ? Just keep moving until you hit that corner , and then stay put . Kate : Okay ? Sasha ? Okay ? I 'm almost there . Just crawl on . Keep your side to the ground . You can do it . You 've made it . I 'm right behind you . There you are . Keep your knees in . Sasha : Kate , thank God . There you are . You 're okay . You 're okay ... What just happened ? I don 't know . I don 't know , Sasha . Sweet Jesus . It 's shrinking so it can get us . Please let it be quick . Okay . We 're going to make a run for it . - I can 't . - Yes you can . Just hold onto me . We 're going to go to our right . No . We 're going to go to the left . All right ? - Okay ? - Okay . On the count of three ... just hold on to me . One , two , three ... I 've got you . Oh my God ! Sasha , no . It responds to our movements . Don 't move . Stay still . Don 't ... Oh my God . Is it gone ? Yeah . It 's gone . Thank you . We did it together . Let 's get out of here before it comes back . My glasses . You 're glasses are gone . Just go up the ladder . - Kate . - Yeah ? What ? - I can smell it . - What ? Did someone die in here ? Yeah . - Yeah . Jerry died . - Oh no . He was so nice . We 've got to go . We 've got to go , honey . Just get up there . One foot after the other . - Where are the others ? - I think we 're on our own . You 're doing good . I see a pattern . Anyone connected to this ... this hypercube ... eventually dies a very violent , and painful death . ( Mrs. Paley whimpering ) I would hate for that to happen to you , Mrs. Paley . I would . So drop the act and tell us how we get out of here . Huh ? Julia : Simon . Simon , that 's enough . - Shut up . - Hey , Simon ... - Shut up . - Okay . Okay , Mrs. Paley . You ready to talk ? 'Cause I 'm all ears . I really don 't need this operation , Doctor . I 'm in perfect health . Just ask my daughter-in-law over there . She 'll explain . This joke 's really getting stale . I 'm going to give you one more chance , Mrs. Paley . You tell me what I need to know , or I 'm going to have to kill you . Do you understand ? I 'm going to kill you . It 's your choice . Julia : Get away from her ! You have a choice to make . Right now . Do you want to get out of here or not ? - Yes , but ... - There are no buts ! Hey guys , maybe ... All right . ( crackling ) Oh shit . It 's here . It 's gonna take my head off . Let 's go . What about Mrs. Paley ? Goddamn it . - Simon : I 'm not gonna die here . - Julia : You can 't leave her . - Simon : Why should I help her ? - Julia : She 'll die . - Max : Forget about her . - I 'm gonna regret this . Max : Julia ! ( screaming ) - Simon : I 'm trying to get this off . - Max : Come on . Hurry . Simon : Shit ! Would someone give me a hand ? Would somebody help me pick her up ? Shit ! Let go of me . Shit ! I 'm not staying here . I 'm out of here . Let go of me . - Simon : Jesus Christ . - Julia : Oh my God . Oh God . ( muffled screams ) Simon : Where do you think you 're going ? Max : Hurry up . Get back here . What the hell ? 6-0-6-5-9 . It could mean anything . Kate : Right . Maybe it 's a coordinate of some kind but in four dimensions . Some ... I don 't know . Sasha : For all we know , it could be somebody 's birthday , or a zip code , or just a serial number . I wish I was just ... smarter . Why do you think you 're in here ? I don 't know . Maybe I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . Damn it . There 's got to be some sort of meaning to this . 6-0-6-5-9 . 6-0-6-5-9 . Maybe they just like to watch us squirm . Max : Alex Trusk is the only one with the resources and brains to create something like this . Julia : Okay , Max . Say you 're right . Say it is Alex Trusk who 's responsible for all of this . Does it help us get out ? No , we 're still stuck here , with no clue . And if this is someone 's game , it isn 't a fair one . Max , do you think ... We 've got to keep moving . Come on . Max ? ( voice in slow motion ) Max , what 's wrong with you ? ( voice in fast forward ) ( voice in slow motion ) Holy shit ! Variable time-speed rooms . - Pretty wild . - I guess you could say that . ( voice in slow motion continues ) ( electronic hissing ) ( groaning , grunting ) Holy jumping Jesus ! Get your hands off me . - Hello , Jerry . - Who the hell are you ? - You don 't recognize me ? - Where am I ? - How do you know my name ? - You don 't know me ? No . Where the hell am I ? You don 't ... ? Wait , wait . You don 't remember me ? - No . - What about the senile old broad , - or the little blind kid ? - What ? Or that thing that chopped you up like little pieces of deli fucking meat ? I 'm a friend ... I mean you no harm . Let me go , and I 'll be on my way . No come on , you ... You mean me no harm ? You 're fucking hilarious , Jerry . How long have you been in here ? I don 't know . I just woke up . You just woke up ? Holy shit ! Holy shit . Maybe you were right before , huh ? You or the ... whatever ... This place does crossover parallel alternate realities , huh ? Have you been drinking ? I really don 't give a shit anymore . We are talking about alternate realities . Can I ask you a question ? Do you mind ? Yeah , okay , sure ... just don 't hurt me , huh ? Are you hungry ? Are you ... hungry ? Yeah , I guess ... my stomach 's ... 'Cause I am hungry . I 'm fucking starving . ( electronic hissing ) ( electronic turndown ) ( electronic hissing ) Oh my God . Kate , what is it ? Kate ? What do you see ? ( locking ) Kate , what 's going on ? I don 't know . I mean ... I think in some other reality , things didn 't turn out so well . Again with the Alex Trusk ? Why are you so afraid of this Alex Trusk ? Because he 's ruthless . He 's a hi-tech genius whose morals make Muammar Qaddafi look like Mother Teresa . Why are you panicking ? Because he 's throwing anybody connected to this thing in here to fucking die ! ( echoes ) Max , you 're not connected . Can you keep a secret ? Sure . I love secrets . I designed a computer game called " Relativity , " where contestants linked to each over the Internet do battle in a 3-D environment , using different time signatures . What are you saying ? Are you saying that you designed all this ? No . Just these variable time speeds rooms . Just the concept . It was for a game . Now here we are . Wow . This is really some game , Max . Do you have other little secrets you want to tell me ? People are dead , okay ? I 'm not responsible for this . It was just a game . I can 't even sell the stupid thing . It 's all involved in a lawsuit . What kind of lawsuit ? I don 't know , some ... Right , you 're a lawyer . A company called Cyber Thrill stole it from me . Cyber Thrill ? You 've heard of them ? Yeah . Are you into computer games ? Settle . Excuse me ? I strongly recommend that you settle . You 'll never win . - How do you know that ? - Because ... you 're not up against Cyber Thrill . They 're just a subsidiary . Who owns them ? Izon . How do you know that ? Because I ... represent them . ( ticking ) ( distant woman 's voice ) ( electronic hissing ) I must be hearing things . ( distant voices ) ( distant voices continue ) ( electronic hissing ) Jerry : Finally . I was wondering if I was the only one in here . Do you need a hand there ? You are upside-down . Do you have any idea what 's going on here ? Be careful . Watch your step . - Crazy . - ( locking ) Simon : You are not the only person here , Jerry . There 's lots of people just like you . Jerry : How do you know my name ? Simon : We 've met before , Jerry . I get this mouth-watering feeling when I talk to you . - What do you mean ? - Come here , look at this . Jerry : Hey , hey . Agh ! - Agh , no ! - Take this ! And this ! ( Jerry screaming ) Why don 't you just go ? I 'm blind , Kate . I 'm a burden . You can move faster without me . Sasha , please , I know how you 're feeling . No you don 't . You have no idea how I 'm feeling . - I know this seems hopeless - It is hopeless . No , it 's not . I 'm gonna figure this out . ( giggling ) " Figure it out . " Trust me , precious . If I haven 't figured it out , you sure as shit aren 't going to . What did you just say ? I 'm sorry , Kate . I didn 't mean to ... No , no . Wait a second . Back that up . Why do you think that you should be able to figure this out ? I wasn 't kidnapped . When I found out they were putting people in here , I tried to blow the whistle on them . So they came after me . I escaped into the one place they wouldn 't dare follow me ... in here . Poetic justice , don 't you think ? Who are you ? Max was right . Jerry was wrong . I exist . Oh my God . Sasha . Of course . Sasha is the nickname for Alexandra . Together : Alex Trusk . Pleased to make your acquaintance . Damn it . This is the worst nightmare I 've ever had . I just I wish I 'd wake up . You really think this is all a dream ? ( sighs ) Definitely . In the real world I 'd never kiss you . Oh , really ? Yeah , you 're not my type . You 're not my type , either . ( ticking ) ( electronic hissing ) Aa-ah ! Ya-aa ! Becky Young . Yeah . Rebecca Young . Yeah . Who ... are you ? Who am I ? I 'm Simon Grady . Your parents hired me to find you . - Really ? - Yeah . Thank God . Yeah . I 'm happy to see you too , Becky . I really am . I 've been wandering these rooms for hours . ( stabbing ) Ahhgh ! ( distant voices ) You gotta love these parallel universes . You built this thing ? I gave them the key to build it ... better than they wanted . I gave them a real hypercube . How do we get out ? Kate , this isn 't a game . There 's no happy ending . ( sighs ) This place is out of control . It 's not stable . Does this number mean nothing ? 6-0-6-5-9 . It 's got to mean something . It 's everywhere . I 'm sorry , Kate . It 's over . No , it is not over . Not yet . ( electronic hissing ) I refuse to die here . ( electronic hissing ) What the hell ? ( crackling ) Oh my God . We 've got to move . Come on . We 've got to get out of here . - Leave me . - No , you 're coming with me . - ( roaring ) - Oh my God . We got to get out of here . Just go up as fast as you can . Faster , faster . Keep going . Okay . Good girl . What the hell ? Oh my God . Okay , we 've got to get out of here . This is insane . It 's Jerry 's diagram . It 's all the numbers . They 're all just suddenly in here . It 's Jerry 's markings ... that dead physicist 's equations ... and that damn colonel 's corpse , just hanging there as if we never even rescued him ? Everything keeps appearing over and over again . Sasha ... please , you have to have some idea what this means . All the realities are starting to collapse into one space . And what happens to us when they ... " it " collapses ? The whole thing implodes . It 's only a matter of time . I 'm not gonna just stand here while it happens . ( electronic hissing ) Kate : I 'm not leaving him behind . - Oh my God . - Man : Kate ! - Kate : Let me go . - Get the hell up here ! Kate : Oh my God . Sasha : Kate . We don 't have much time . ( gasps ) No . I refuse to die here . I wish I had your spirit . Hello , gorgeous . Miss me ? Huh ? Come on in . The water 's fine . Agh ! ( Sasha screaming ) Hello , Kate . Let her go . Who are you ? Yeah , it 's me ... good old Simon . Do you remember this ? Do you ? I 've waited a long time for pay back . That was just ... seconds ago . Don 't be so stupid , Kate . Time works differently in this place . Hey , just ... okay . Just let her go . She 's just a kid . She 'll be a dead little kid , unless you come here to papa . Okay . Just let her go ... we can figure something out , okay ? You take her place . What do you want ? I 'm hungry . - Simon ? - Huh ? Sasha : There 's no point . We 're all dead anyway . Oh , oh . Okay . No ! Oh , come on Kate . The fun 's just beginning . Oh my God . What the hell ? - Yah ! - Agh ! I 'm really gonna miss you . ( panting ) Jesus ... Of course , 6-0-6-5-9 . It 's an expiration date . He figured out when it 's gonna implode . Kate : Leave me . Man : Hello , Kate . Welcome back . So , you figured it out . Yes , sir . No time to spare . The device ... any luck ? We 'll take that to Darcy and see if anything recorded on it . ( gunshot ) ( phone ringing ) Sir ? Yes , sir . Phase two is terminated . I see . Yes , sir . Right away , sir .

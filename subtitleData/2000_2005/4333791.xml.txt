 Run it again . I have run it 16 times already . He 's telling me to leave . He doesn 't want me to get hurt . Hel , you know your father is dead . Ghosts don 't show up on surveillance holograms . Creegan told you he manipulated the holographic recording of your father to deceive you . Freeze it ! There ! Have you ever seen a hologram do that ? It is unusual . But any number of factors could account for the distortion . That is not a hologram , Mauser , and it is not a ghost . My father 's alive . ID confirmed . Key code and number of the prisoner you are visiting ? MS-1138 . Sorry , access to that prisoner is strictly forbidden . Thought so . Hel , what are you doing ? Sorry , pal . It 'll wear off in a couple of hours . Don 't force me to take action against you . It 's not too late . It 's not too late for you either , Voice . Tell me where my father is and I 'll turn right back . Hel , your father is dead . Same old story , and you 're stickin ' to it . It 's the truth . I 've heard enough of your truth . Hel , don 't do this . After all we 've been through together , everything we 've achieved . It 's meaningless without trust . And I don 't trust you anymore . Not where my father 's concerned . We can resolve this , Hel . If you 'll just give me the chance , I 'll explain everything to you . You had your chance . Security breach . Initiate lockdown . You 're not going to make this easy on me , are you , Voice ? Up here ! Hold it ! DNA clearance rescinded . Access denied . Damn it , Voice . Access cleared . We do have posted visiting hours , Hel . You listen to me , you freak . My father 's alive , and you 're gonna help me find him . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . " In the year 2525 " " There are women with the will to survive " " Fighting for a brand new day " " Nothing is gonna get in their way " " And in the year 2525 " " Three women keep hope alive " " Joining forces to reclaim the Earth " " Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth " Subtitles by subXpacio Sure , I 'll help you find your dad , Hel . CLEOPATRA 2525 2x09 " TRUTH BE TOLD " I hope you brought a shovel . You think you killed him ? I think you missed . It 's a tasty little mind game you 've cooked up here , Voice . You have me captured by one Voice team , and then you send Hel in to release me . She 's not here . But she is on to me . How can I be of service ? I know you worked with my father ... and Voice . Something happen between the two of you ? You thought you had to kill my dad ? I think he 's having the last laugh ... on both of us . Whatever game you 're playing here , Hel , I can 't say it hasn 't piqued my curiosity . This way ! They 're down here ! The game is just beginning . Sarge ? Sarge , it 's me , Voice . Can you hear me ? Sarge , wake up ! Mauser ? What 's wrong ? Sarge , we have a situation . You 're not kidding . I was dreaming I had Voice inside my head . It wasn 't a dream , Sarge . What is this ? Sarge , calm yourself . How did she get inside my head ? Sarge , I need you . It concerns Hel . She 's removed her Voice receptor . What do you mean ? She 's not here ? There 's no way to track her . I 'll give you the details when you get to the main lab . Is this what you do with all your new recruits ? A discussion for another time , Sarge . Yeah . Well , you count on that discussion , Voice . And don 't for one minute think it 's not gonna include you . This better be good , Mauser . Far from it , I 'm afraid . I 'm patching you through now . Where 's Hel ? Sarge , this was recorded 30 minutes ago at our facility on Level PR-63 . Oh , my God ! That 's Hel . And what 's she doing with Creegan ? Well , do we know which way she - Sarge , I have an idea where they might be headed . You and Cleopatra must proceed down shaft immediately . There is a faster route . Just give us the shaft coordinates , and Mauser , if you 'll kindly remove my new Voice receptor , we 'll get underway . She 's talking ? You have a receptor ? I 'm going with you , Sarge . I don 't think you understand , Voice . You understand me , Sarge . Your Voice receptor stays with you , or I dispatch another team to intercept Hel and Creegan . The choice is yours . You know , I never regarded shaft falling as an art form , Hel , till there was you . Get in here . Why , Hel , this is so sudden . Shut up ! What if I cried out , Hel ? Think they 'd put you in a cell right next to mine ? There 's nothing here . Let 's check the next level . Now , I don 't want to spend one more second with you than I have to , so here 's the deal . Help me find my father , I let you walk . You jerk me around and we see how well you shaft fall with your hands tied and no shaft gear . Daddy 's dead ! I don 't lie about the lives I 've taken , Hel . It 's a whole big pride thing . Oh , yeah ? Explain this . It 's the hologram I manipulated . A hologram didn 't save my life . And it didn 't help Sarge shut down that containment breach you set up on that level . Look . Carter , my friend , I don 't believe it . You actually did it . Did what ? Where is he ? I can take you to him , but it 'll cost you more than my freedom . What do you want ? You know what I want ! No . All my life , Voice has stood in my way . Her and her precious little teams fighting for an impossible cause . Well , not anymore . You 're gonna help me achieve my lifelong dream , Hel . You give me Voice or there 's no deal . Where do we start ? They 're circumventing the facility 's security countermeasures . Level V-94 . You must hurry , Sarge . Use the word " must " one more time , Voice , we stop hurrying . I 'm reading another structure below us . Welcome to Voice 's psionic headquarters . " Psionic " ? Where ghosts are made . Would you mind ? Yes . Actually , I would . You won 't get further without my help . I wanna find your father just as much as you . Face it ! We 're partners now . So much as look at me wrong , and I 'll miss next time , partner . I assume you came prepared . Everybody get down ! Warning . Intruders detected . I said down ! Facility lockdown commencing . Now sealing all exits . Hello , Arch ! What are you doing in there ? Cre-Creegan , I-I thought you were in prison . I couldn 't resist a visit to the old magic shop . How 's tricks ? Creegan , did you bring me down here for a reason or a casual visit ? Relax , Hel . I 'm trying to break through the encryption codes to deactivate the containment field . What was hidden will be revealed . Voil√† ! It 's a psionic trans plane generator . You 've seen this before ? Another one of Voice 's employees-turned-psychopaths zapped one of my teammates into another realm of existence with that thing . We sent it to Voice for study . More like safekeeping . Creegan , stop this . You 're endangering the whole project . So , it was Voice 's weapon all along . Used correctly , it 's the perfect infiltration device daddy and I helped Voice conceive . You saw the holophoto , Hel . We were one big happy think tank down here , huh , Arch ? That is , until dad convinced Voice that I no longer fit the psychological profiles necessary to continue the psionic projects ! Guess the hair and makeup didn 't help . Oh , no . Oh , yeah . Creegan , just what we came for . I thought your father had died keeping this out of my hands . I 'll take that . Naturally . Now what are you doing ? Confirming your dad 's coordinates . Yes , they did send you there , Carter . Just as we planned . That 's just below the surface . I 'll just transfer those ... You wouldn 't need my help anymore , would you ? Right . Shall we ? Security override . Systems normal . Hey , Hel . What 's goin ' on ? Just back off , Sarge . Hey , that 's the gun that Raina used to turn me into a ghost . Raina 's alive ? I 'll have to look her up . This doesn 't concern you two . Excuse me ? We 're your team , Hel . We 're your friends . And now you 're standing there with him , pointing your gauntlet at us , and this doesn 't concern us ? Why don 't you tell us what 's goin ' on , Hel , and maybe we can figure this out . My father 's alive , Cleo , and I have to find him . Sarge , such a mission is an exercise in futility . Voice says you 're wasting your time . Yeah , you rip her out of your head , she shows up in mine . Go figure . You are full of surprises , Voice . But that cause you 've been hiding behind all these years concerns my father . It 's time I know why , Sarge . His is the only voice that will talk . Quite willingly , knowing that Hel is going to give me Voice . What ? It was the only way . Hel , can 't we just talk about this ? There 's no more time for talk . Hel , we 're so close . I 've come too far . I have to know . Take the shot , Sarge . Hel , as much as I would love for Voice to shut up , I don 't think giving her to Creegan is the way to go . I 'm sorry . Damn you , Hel . Don 't make me do this . That 's my Hel . Hel , it 's not too late . Hel ! Hel , if you 're still here , just listen to us , okay ? We can help you . Li-Like you and Sarge did for me . Okay ? You don 't need their help . Sarge , align your gauntlet to scan for decoherent matter . Yeah , I 'm already picking up faint particle traces . In a few seconds , they 'll detect us , Hel . Shall we ? Hel , please . I know you can hear me . Okay , ju-just don 't go ! Damn it . What 's wrong ? They 're gone . One thing I never understood about this technology is how it allows us to pass through walls and yet walk on floors . I spent years working on that problem , Hel . I solved it by retuning the residual gravimetric particles to interface with the decoherent matter in your feet . Really ? It 's time for you to live up to your half of the deal , Hel . Just one more giant leap , and you 're home . Where ? It 's exhausting . What is this place ? A Betrayer factory ? No , Hel . Betrayer factories litter the surface . There are thousands of them . This is something quite different . One signature , straight ahead . Betrayer ? They 're around , I don 't think what you 're reading is a Betrayer . How do you know ? Oh , come on , Hel , have you forgotten ? We 're in the psionic plane , as is your gauntlet . Therefore , I 'd venture to guess that what you 're reading is actually - Someone else in the psionic plane with us . Now , I wonder who it could be ? Twenty meters ahead . Sarge , just before Hel and Creegan disappeared from the psionic lab , I monitored a transmission directed at a Bailey facility . So , what are you saying ? Creegan 's working with the Bailies ? Or Hel is . Well , for old times ' sake , let 's just assume that it 's Creegan . Sarge , you must make sure Hel cannot pass on any critical team information to the Bailies . Well , here 's an idea , Voice . Why don 't we just bring Hel home ? If possible . What 's it like having Voice in there ? It 's like a headache that talks . Oh . Oh , my God . Now , Hel , your journey is over . Dad ? Dad . Helen . How did you ... I can 't believe I 've really found you . I wish you hadn 't . What ? Hello , Carter . Creegan . What is this ? Helen , what have you done ? What have ... I 've been mourning you for the past 12 years . Blaming him for your murder . And now I find you 're alive and here . What have you done ? You shouldn 't have come . And certainly not with him . Please , Helen , leave here while you still can . Not without some answers . I just hate long hellos . Get him ! Damn you , Creegan . It 's no use , Helen . We 're in the psionic plane , remember ? But , hey , at least we 're here in spirit , huh ? Not for long . You go get daddy . I 'll wait here . The hell you will . Damn it , Helen ! Get out of here now ! Not without you ! Get the girl ! Some family reunion , huh ? Fireworks and everything ! So , you are Creegan ? In the flesh . We received your communication . You have served us well . You will be rewarded . Oh , will I ever . You don 't look much older than the last time I saw you . This place will give you a few gray hairs . But something about existing in the trans psionic plane , it slows the aging process . At least you get somethin out of it . Helen , don 't . I 'm sorry . Don 't what ? Don 't be hurt ? Don 't be angry ? My father abandons me and then leads me to believe a complete lie for the last 12 years ! Helen , I couldn 't contact you . My mission - Your mission ! Your mission was more important to you than raising a daughter who loved you . I can handle Voice lying to me . But you ? Voice and I thought it was best . Voice always knows best . Mauser , what 's the story ? Hel and Creegan may have made their way to a Bailey command nexus . Command nexus ? Is that like the Death Star ? It 's a heavily fortified secret Bailey command and control center . Yep . Death Star . Cleopatra will be able to gain entry to the nexus . How 's Cleopatra gonna be able to get in a place like that ? Cleo will pass herself off as a Betrayer . Yeah , I can do that . Betrayer Cleopatra reporting for duty . Crush . Kill . Destroy . No . A Betrayer is programmed to act human . Remember your own double ? Now , once inside the nexus , follow orders and act naturally . Like me . And you 'll need this . The identification chip from your now defunct Betrayer double . It is still keyed to work only with your exact genetic code . So you implant that into Cleo and she 'll emit a Betrayer signature . Correct . You can do this . Just stay cool . Think on your feet . Improv is my specialty . Okay , Mauser . Give me my motivation . No offense , but I 'm kind of used to talking to the top guy , you know , the big boss . We are grateful to you for uncovering the unseen enemy who has been stealing our secrets . Now that you mention it , not to sound unappreciative , but I was thinkin ' maybe we could renegotiate our contract . We 've already guaranteed you a lifetime of safe passage on the surface . Yeah . Well , that 's great and all , but , you know , I think we 've just scratched the surface . It 's so hard getting good underground help these days . You know , I have this so-called mutant army . I must go through like 50 mutants a week . But I was thinkin ' , if you were to give me 200 of your Betrayers , well - You are in no position to ask for anything . Au contraire . What if I told you that I had the link to locating the ever-elusive Voice ? Now , I 've tried to track Voice with this little jewel before . With your technology , we can tap into her network without even her knowing . What do you say ? Deal ? Deal . Oh , I do love doing business with you folks . After Creegan was kicked off the lab team , there was an accident . I was exposed to psionic radiation , and it left me with the ability to access the psionic plane . Without the trans plane gun ? Yes . That 's why I was the only one who qualified for this mission . Who else could have gained access to a Bailey command nexus ? So you could have gotten away when Creegan blew your cover ? Why didn 't you just pop back into the psionic plane ? I don 't know . I was so surprised to see you . The transference takes great mental concentration . So why don 't you just leave now ? I couldn 't if I wanted to . They 've set up a damping field around this cell . And even if I could , I would never leave you alone . So , what 's so important about this place , anyway ? You don 't know ? Uh-uh . Bailies are born here . Born ? They are organic . They achieve sentience by absorbing human neural tissue . That 's why they won 't exterminate humanity . They need us . In a sense , they are us . Hopefully , they 'll put me in detention , close to where they 're holding Hel . They 're gonna take my weapons . So once we 're in , you 've got to find their arsenal . Okay . I 'm ready . I caught this human snooping around outside . She put up quite a fight , but she 's no match for a Betrayer . I 'll take the prisoner . She 's my prisoner . You know , I - I made the collar , so I 'll take her down to detention . Run an ID scan . Valid authenticity . She 's clear . Nice to be validated . Hey , watch the hands . Fall in for a weapons check . A weapons check ? Didn 't we have one of those last week ? Okay . Present arms . Present arms . Oh , malfunction . Error . Systems all , uh , screwed up . Proceed to Maintenance . Understood . On the double . Yes . Nice setup you boys have here . It will take time , but this device will allow us to infiltrate the Voice 's entire network . You have earned your reward . Well , seeing Voice destroyed is reward enough . Well , that and my own army of Betrayers . Uh ? It 's almost over , Voice . You 'll never see it comin ' . Sarge ! Hope I 'm not interrupting anything . What are you doing here ? Well , you know , kicking some Bailey ass . Saving you . How are you doin ' ? Creegan 's working with the Bailies . He has my voice receptor . Gee , I wonder how that happened . I assume that you have a plan to get out . Don 't worry . I 've got a Betrayer on the case . Voice just had to say the survival of the resistance hinges on me . " Stop Creegan , " she said . " Get Hel back , " she says . Oh , yeah , it could be as easy as Door Number 2 or Door Number 2 , but when the architects don 't even believe in doors , I 'm kind of screwed . Ow . That 's more like it . Bingo . Aren 't you a little short for a Betrayer ? Yeah , I do know you . You 're that bimbo from Hel 's team . The " bimbo , " as you call her , is dead . Or do you not know how Betrayers are made , human ? So , Hel had a Betrayer on her team the whole time . I wasn 't told ! Have them check my ID chip . Or if I snap your neck , will that convince you ? A real bang-up job , boys . Can I have one ? What was I thinking ? Voice wouldn 't be stupid enough to send that dimwitted blonde in to save Hel , right ? I must continue my patrol . You do that . So , was it worth it ? If you have something to say to me , just say it , Sarge . 'Cause unless Cleo pulls off a miracle , we don 't have much time . All right . How long have you been cooking up this little scheme of yours , keeping us in the dark ? Breaking Creegan out of cryo-detention , that took some pretty serious planning , and you never let on . Why didn 't you come to me ? Why do you think ? Look where you are now . I thought it might come to something like this , I wasn 't about to let the people that I love most be dragged down by me . It 's not easy to give up everything you love to do something you have to . Is it ? All right , there , my little jailbirds , let 's blow this pop stand . Oh , you must be Hel 's dad . It 's really nice to meet you . Cleo . Did you get some weapons ? Y - Yeah , I tried , but everyone around here can make their own . It doesn 't matter . I can show you the way out of here . Sarge , you must recover Hel 's Voice receptor . We can 't go yet . We 've got to get Hel 's Voice receptor back . I know where it is ! I ran into Creegan in that , like , main control room place . Man , I really hate him . Good work . Take us there . Helen , no . No . You don 't have any weapons . Get your team out of here and let me handle this . No , Creegan has my receptor because I made the mistake of dealing with him . Now I 'm gonna correct that mistake . It 's been a fun game of cat-and-mouse , Voice . And it 's just about over . Come on , Cleo . That 's a girl . No ! Yes . Let 's boogie , team . Come on , Cleo ! All you had to do was to suck their neural matter out to make baby Bailies ! Was that too much to ask ? Get them ! We 're trapped ! Group hug ! Forgive me , Hel . Dad , we 'll talk about it later . Dad ? Dad ! He left us . Oh , my shield 's failing . We have more in common than you thought , Hel . Looks like daddy screwed us both over . You go to hell ! You first . She 's mine . Hel ! Dad ! Carter . You know , your daughter 's grown up to be a real pain in the neck . Yeah . Like father , like daughter . Cleo , stay down ! You know , I 'm glad I didn 't kill you 12 years ago when I had the chance . Really ? Now I get to do it in front of your daughter . Well , then you 're gonna have to be a better killer than you were a scientist , or a friend . We 've got to get out of here ! Dad , come on ! Don 't worry , Carter , I 'm a much better killer . No ! Oh , oh ! Oh , my shield 's failing . Stay down . Sarge , get over here ! Hold on ! Come on . Coming ! Helen . Daddy . Oh , God , Dad . It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're going to be just fine . We don 't lie to each other . Not anymore . Come on , Dad . Helen , I know you think I left you . But I was always there . Whenever you needed me most . I need you now . Fight . I 've already had a good long fight . The only thing I regret is the time we lost . Daddy , please . I love you , Helen . I love you , too . Sarge , you must bring Creegan in alive . We better go , Hel . Hel , we 've really got to go . Looks like you 're outgunned , Helen . Creegan 's gonna pay for what he 's done . We 'll see to it . You wouldn 't really have let Creegan go , right , Hel ? Fortunately , it didn 't come to that . It 's just that attitude that makes me question Hel 's leadership of the team . Voice doesn 't know if she can trust you anymore , Hel . The feeling 's mutual . Where does that leave the team ? I don 't know . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

Get out of here . Take Elena with you . Run . The report , I told you I 'm writing on the state of the world ... I think it 's going to be fantastic . I mean , the disorder of the world can be beautiful . I got no more money left ... a couple of dollars in my pocket maybe and I 'm on my way to Jakarta . It 's a big world , it 's wonderfully quiet here on the plane . I feel fantastic . How is it going in New York ? Maybe it 's time for you to come home . You and Elena . - Where are we going ? - I don 't know . There is so much love in the world , John , so much love . And there is death . Maybe mostly death at the moment . People are dying in the streets ... because they miss each other , miss love , miss closeness . I 'm forgetting something . I have a note about you . It says " the lovers met " ... " the lovers met , and ... " and I can 't read my own note . I make a note and I can 't read it . It 's an important note . An old one . The disorder of the world ... You and Elena . It 's all connected some how , it 's all connected . We are in Brooklyn , right ? Hey come on . Is this Brooklyn ? Of course ! It 's called Brooklyn . We need a room a couple of hours to make phone calls , then we 'll leave . Does this look a whorehouse ? Does she look like a whore ? No absolutely not , I 'm sorry , you 're a beautiful lady .

Yes , it 's snowing . Come on , let 's go . It 's really snowing . I cant believe it 's July ... Brenda ! Bring down the camera . Have you seen that it 's snowing ? Yeah , I can 't believe it .

John , please don 't go up there . Things aren 't what they seem anymore . You don 't know anything . Just calm ... John ! Don 't go up there ! - Michael , do you have the key ? - No . If you go in there , you 'll get into something you really shouldn 't . What shouldn 't I get into ? Forget about Elena , she 's not good for you any longer . Come on ... It 's okay . Just give me the key . Please . They are destroying her , John . Can you help her ? Here you can have the key ... but it wasn 't me who let you in . Things are going really well for me now , John . And what about you , Michael ... are they destroying you ? You ' re coming home with us . We are taking you home , okay ? You don 't have to stay here , do you ? We are a family , we take care of each other , okay ? Come here ... Now tell me , what 's on the other side of that door ? It 's okay ... Come on , we 'll go together . You killed her ... You killed her ! Put the knife down . Get away form me ... go away ! Put the fucking knife down ! - Go ! - Put it down . Go away ! Come back here . Go away ... Go away . We want to go home ... They put something inside of me . It 's no fun . We 're very sweet . We don 't want to die . You killed her ! - John , they 're crazy , you hear me ? - Go away ! They don 't know what they 're talking about . That 's not Elena . We don 't know who are you ? Don 't worry about it ... Shut up , shut up , shut the fuck up . See ? It isn 't her . They don 't know anything . What was the name of Elena 's dog in Poland ? What was your dog 's name ? You see , John , they know nothing . It 's okay , just calm down ... You get in there ... You go on ... Get in there ... It 's okay , John come on ... Listen to this . Elena will stop skating . These girls will replace her . They buy them in Europe and fuck their brains up with chemicals . It 's simply business . - It takes some time to get used to . - I just have to find Elena . - Stay on the sidewalk . - It 's okay come on . We just have to find somewhere for you to lie down . Are you okay ? What ? - Look at that , he 's dead . - No , he 's not dead . Go away . It wont be long , they usually die when they lie like that . I 've seen it a hundred times at school . He 's only fainted . Move your foot . Move your foot , or I will kill you . Lets go , Jacob . He is dying , mom . I can see it in his eyes . John ... It 's okay . ... gravity is a rare natural occurrence ... The world is becoming a colder place ... Look , it 's snowing . It 's strange , that it 's snowing in the summer . What 's she saying ? Giulio come over here . I have never seen anything like this . Take a look . Good morning , Mr. Marczewski . Or should I say good afternoon ? Hi , John , how are you doing ? We 've arranged a dinner , John . A farewell dinner . You 're leaving us and we won 't be seeing you any more . We 're sorry about that . We like you . Arthur ... Come on , sit down . I think it 's time we had a chat . Time we told you some of our family secrets ... You have to sign here ... and here . Now , I don 't know what you think about me , you two . What is this rumour that I want to eliminate Elena ? Where did that come from ? No , John ... I have bigger plans than that . Can I get something to drink ? Of course , give him something to drink . And Elena , come on , say hi to John . This isn 't a funeral . Everyone else , get your self something to drink as well . John , we 're a family that is very dependent on Elena 's cooperation . I also consider you to be a member of our family . What I am about to tell you demands 100 % loyalty . As you 're aware , Elena 's expressed a wish to retire for some time now . Elena has had some problems , which she can tell you about herself . She 's asked to be released from her duties . So naturally ... I 'm disappointed when you two start acting like little children . You know running away and all that . And I can 't allow that to happen again . I didn 't come here to compete with you . I just wanted to tell you a couple of things . You 've already met the other Elenas ... or whatever the hell you want to call them . They 're being trained now . Soon , they 'll be ready to replace Elena , so that she ... so that both of you can quit . Now it 's natural that you two would have to disappear for a while . Change names , countries , identity 's and all that stuff . Arthur can you explain ? On Friday you will sail via Rotterdam to Saint Petersburg . There you will meet a Mr.Vladimir Kuluschin . He will take you till the airport from where you will fly to Moskow . Now in Moscow you 'll live in the Charamusk district , it 's beautiful . The University is there . It 's the best part of town . Look here is a beautiful bakery on the corner . John , I want us to part friends . You both mean a lot to me . You will be missed around here . I just have one last question for you , David . Who is Mr. Morrison ? He 's another friend of mine , why ? No reason ... Let 's eat . Yeah , let 's eat . Why didn 't you tell me about these girls , this whole sick ... It 's sick yes ... they forced me into it . I wanted to protect you . I wanted to keep you out of all this . Now you are marked . Now you know they exist . We 're in it together now , John . I know . We need to get out of here . Let me see your arms . Please . Stop it , stop it ... It will go away again . I just need to sleep and it will go away again . I just need to sleep . I want to get married . We already are married , for Christ 's sake . Then I want to get married again ... I want to be a white bride . You 've always wanted that . You remember that ? Yes . I always did want to be a white bride . You 're so sweet . We 'll get out of here . I promise . Yes , we 'll make it . Michael , we have to get out of here . We 'll leave tomorrow ... Thursday . Tomorrow Elena will go over to the ice rink to rehearse as usual . Then we leave . We 'll go up north . It 's as simple as that . Betsy already has the tickets . Betsy 's on our side . - But they 'll do it now . - No , no , no . They wouldn 't do that . Because they need information ... You 'll see . We 're all going to sit down ... and in a while they 'll start asking questions , about back home . All the things about Elena 's past that they can 't find out anywhere . Listen to me . You 're both suppose to leave this world on Friday , you know ? Be killed , that 's the plan . Are you Mr. Marczewski ? - Yes , I 'm John Marczewski . - Mr . Marczewski ... David asked me to have a few words with you . - Who are you ? - My name is Morrison . - Would you like to come in ? - No , thank you . I just want to reassure you ... David thinks you are under the impression I wish to harm you . Mr. Morrison ... Our power of judgement is a bit off at the moment . We don 't know what is summer and what is winter ... I understand completely , Mr. Marczewski . My wife cries all the time , about all of these ... cosmic disturbances , I suppose you could call them . The Ugandans , the snow ... the ice age . It gets under people 's skin . And into their hearts unfortunately . I don 't quite follow you ... Mr. Marczewski ... the chaos in the world is reflected in the souls of the human beings . It 's snowing in July , people 's hearts stop . It 's simple Mr. Marczewski . Especially for an educated man like yourself . PhD . Polish literature . My congratulations . Thank you . Oh , these are for you . From my wife as well . We 're great admires of Mrs. Marczewski , watch her on TV . Please give her my regards . Good evening , Mr. Marczewski . John , are you okay ? Michael , I just met the man , for Christ 's sake . Mr. Morrison . He just came to the door . He 's no problem now . You 're leaving tomorrow . Just behave normally . - Good evening . - Good evening . Mr. Marczewski , I would like to introduce to you ... Yes , it 's Elena , but her real name is Milica . John Marczewski . Nice to meet you . She 'd like to apologize for her behaviour earlier ... - but she was very frightened . - I 'm sorry to hear that . Milica had a boyfriend herself . He looked a bit like you ... Welcome , Elena . All these young girls have been looking forward to meeting you . She says that Michael , isn 't as sweet as you are ... and that you are much more beautiful . She says , that she 's dreamt about you ... She wanted to speak to you before but didn 't dare . The one you met in the hallway is gone now . Zarbili ... It 's dangerous to go out alone . There are a few questions about your childhood ... which would be very interesting if you could tell us about ... before you leave . There are some things we couldn 't research , you know . What would you like to know ? You had a dog you loved very much . We don 't know the name of the dog . My dog 's name was Igor . Igor ... Bad dog ... He drank beer . There is some dispute about about where you two met . It was on the lake . In the winter . And you lived at the children 's hospital in Wiezyca , right ? And you knew Michael from the streets ? Yes , and he introduced us down at the lake . I have the impression that you met at young age . You had a good life in Poland . And your father beat you ... Maybe we can continue this another time , please . There 's just one more question , Mr. Marczewski . They got a noticeable desire to come and skate with you . If it 's okay ? Is this something you would like to be a part in ? Yes , of course ... Isn 't it , John ? John ... I can 't ... I don 't ... feel ... very well . - Can I touch you ? - I look very like you . I am your sister . We are the same ... Look at me . - Can I smell you ? - Oh you 're so beautiful . Your skin is so soft . - I am your sister . - We are the same . We are the same ... Look at me . No ! Get away ! Get away ! You ... Welcome to the world at zero . Into a minute before the freeze . I 'd just like to remind you of the usual safety precautions . Remember the fresh water freeze , is a global phenomenon ... so don 't stay lounging in the pool like those children in Delhi . Ad antifreeze to your lavatories ... remove water sources from pets , empty your glasses . We say this every year , but there are always people who forget . As we all know today is the day when all fresh water freezes to ice . This year it will be approximately a two minute freeze ... so remember to wrap up warm and stay indoors . John , look ... Fred ! It 's snowing . Come on , hurry , get up ! Wake up it 's snowing . It 's July and it snows . No question , it 's overwhelming . Come on ! God , it 's cold . Ugandan Foreign Minister Kabaka Okello requested ... international assistance to aid Uganda 's agricultural sector . In a meeting with United Nations General Secretary Javier Magana ... Okello reported an estimated loss of 40 million dollars ... due to the extreme low temperatures that Uganda has faced . Last week , temperatures ... Betsy 's coming now ...

Come here . - They haven 't told you ? - No . You have a problem with your heart . But don 't worry about it . So many people have these days . That 's why you sleep so much . No , Betsy , nobody told me that . That 's why they want to kill me . I 'm of no use anymore . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - Hey , there you are . - Well , of course we 're here . I 'll just go change , okay ? - Is everything okay ? - Everything is fine . Michael , it 's pitch dark in here . Can we have some light ? Okay , wait a minute . Good morning , Mr. Marczewski . Yes , sorry , I 'd forgotten . It 's nice to see you again . You are more beautiful than yesterday . You were beautiful yesterday , too ... I tell you yesterday , but ... I miss men . I 'm sorry about English . No , it 's okay . Elena is only downstairs changing , but she will be coming up soon . Look at this ! Woouups and then backwards . My god . Really nice . - No I didn 't do it like that . - Look at that , graceful . I can get into a lot of trouble for this . They are not allowed here . They are not allowed to exist . Oh there she is .

I got to be a white bride after all . Yes ... I love you . I love you too . What ? What 's happening ? I am here ... I 'm with you ... I 'm with you ... John , you 're probably out there somewhere in the snow . Both of you . It 's like the old days ... As for me , it 's incredible . I 'm going to end my days in row 21 . I can 't think of a better place to die . It 's snowing all over the world , so we can 't land . And your big brother is a little bit frightened . But I did finish my report on the state of the world . I wrote : They made it ... About you , about love . What can I say ? It 's all about love . And that 's the way it should be .

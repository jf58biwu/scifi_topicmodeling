 Previously on Farscape . I am in control of me ! No more , John . There 's no Scorpius here . You burn Moya ? To save her . - No ! Crais and Talyn have located some kind of surgeon . If it wasn 't serious , they wouldn 't have called us . Hello , Delvian . John Crichton to Scorpius . Request immediate extraction . Given no other choices , I will shoot you down . Ejecting now ! Aeryn , can you comply ? - Negative . Aeryn , listen to me . This is John . It 's John . Yeah , is it really you , John ? - Yes . The harness is jammed ! Aeryn ! No ! Oh , God ... What have I done ? At peace , Aeryn . Remove chip . Take the damn thing out . Down there ! Hello , Doctor . So good to see you again . You no longer serve a purpose . - I only hope ... the wormhole technology I 've waited so patiently for makes more sense . Goodbye . And now on Farscape ... Is there still no communication from the planet ? Nothing . The Diagnosian said we would be notified as soon as there was something to report . Pilot , any news ? I would have told you if there were . We should be down there at Crichton 's side . John did not want us there . We must respect that . The microt you hear anything , Pilot . - Yes , Zhaan . Pilot , I remind you that we shouldn 't stay any longer than necessary . We know that , Crais . Pilot , have you heard anything ? No ! When I know something , you 'll know it . Until then , leave me alone ! Is he always like that ? Aeryn 's death hit him pretty hard . Hit everybody hard . Now why were you hiding , Grunchlk ? Why do you and your goons come storming in here with your guns drawn ? Oh , just a precaution . Precaution ? Well , so was that . So go on , son . Put your precautions away and pay me what we agreed . Listen , I informed you the microt that Crichton got here , so you keep up your end of the deal , all right ? Listen , son , you don 't want to frell with me on this one ! Grunchlk . If I was in your situation , I 'd be attempting to present evidence that I still served a purpose . Does he ? Now that my neuro chip has absorbed the information I need from John 's mind , we 're finished here . Poor Crichton . He 's going to be so lonely . Never mind . John . It 's me , John . I 'm still here . What ? No . No , no , no , no . You 're gone . The chip 's gone . Get out of my head . I 'd like to . I don 't wish to remain here . Therefore , you must die . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Serve a purpose ? Of course , I serve a purpose . Any purpose you like , sir . Got a purpose ? No ? Well I 'll come up with one . Look , there ... there 's a purpose in itself . Sir . Officer Kobrin , I ordered you to remain with the Marauder . Yes , sir . However we 've received an encoded message pulse from the Command Carrier . Oh , report . Battle ended successfully . Ahh . However , the unexpected duration of the engagement will delay our rendezvous 5.3 arns . Five arns ... Crichton 's shipmates won 't stay away that long . We can eliminate them . They don 't worry me . A Leviathan gunship commanded by a vengeful traitor does . Sir , I flew us here undetected . Because Crais and Talyn were preoccupied with Officer Sun 's last flight . If we were to leave now , how long could you keep us undetected ? We 'd be a thousand metras away before the gunship detected us . Not good enough . The Carrier 's still so far off . Talyn would easily overtake us . We 'll wait . Ah , ah , if ... If you 're thinking of staying , sir , I 've got a splendid room . All the comforts . Very private . Show us . Splendid . Death is the only sensible course , John . For everything there is a season . A time to be born ... and a time to die . Yes , yes , yes . The devil quotes scripture . I thought you were put in here to protect me . Until my task here was completed . Now that Scorpius has recovered the neuro chip ... You should be gone ! How come you 're not ? I don 't know , but this ... this is intolerable for both of us . End it , John ! Free us from one another ! Scorpius has beaten you . Aeryn Sun is dead . Your power of speech is gone . The only one you 'll ever talk to again is me ! Is that how you want to live ? ! End it , John . Do it . Grunchlk , where are you ? You told me that ship would be here by now . Grunchlk ! Oh , Crichton . You 're even more inarticulate than you ... Oh . Tocot ? We 'll come down at once , Rygel . D 'Argo . Hey . We got a meal ready . There 's a problem . Zhaan , Stark and I are going down to the planet . We 'll go with you . - No , I need you to stay here with Moya . Scorpius 's Command Carrier could arrive at any microt . If it does , I want you to Starburst away immediately . But Pilot can look after ... - Just run away and hide ... Do what I tell you ! Frell ! I 'm frelling sick of this ! And when the services finished , everyone except Crichton went back up to their ship , and the doc , he started the surgery . And your last communication with any of them was when ? Uh ... nine or ten arns . Sir , the Marauder 's sensors have detected a Transport Pod leaving Moya on a vector towards us . They didn 't speak to you first ? They must be getting apprehensive . Oh , when they get here , let me speak to ' em . I 'll , uh , I 'll stall ' em , send ' em away , whatever you want . I 'll ... I 'll say you anything you like . How prescient of you . Yours is an interesting species , Grunchlk . Simple mind . Simple brain . Easily dominated . And easily controlled . About time ! Keep trying , Rygel . You try . I 've done everything you told me . Turned on the bioneutralizer . John . - Turned off the see-through skull machine . Enough is enough ! - John It 's just not working ! He 's breathing ! Scor ... Scorpius . The Command Carrier couldn 't have arrived without our knowing . Scorpius must have come in a Prowler or a Marauder on a stealth trajectory . Could he still be here ? Possibly . If so , reinforcements may follow . Talyn and I will adjust our orbit for maximum scan . Splendid room . All the comforts . Very private . Splendid room . All the comf ... Very priv ... I 'll say ... I 'll say anything ... I 'll say anything you like . Well ... with a little diversion . Braca . Let me see your pulse pistol . Splendid . Hoo ! Help ! Scorpius ... shot me . Took the chip . When ? Couple arns ago . Gone now . Are you sure he 's gone ? Long gone . Grunchlk , you ... you used these poor beings as donors . The doc couldn 't operate else . Crichton didn 't want the operation if it would harm a donor . But nobody was harmed . The doc was only borrowing some cerebral fluid to top up Crichton 's . They could spare it . How can they be harmed if they 're already dead ? Yeah . - They aren 't dead . Well , I mean , they 're effectively dead 'cause they can 't be restored and live . They 're trapped between two realms . Lost . Stark ! John needs our help now . Tocot , what can we do now ? Well , Doc says he could try and restore his speech with a neural tissue transplant , but that would use up a donor . You mean , kill . However you want . Crichton definitely would not want that . Look , it might not even work anyway . The doc says this is so scrambled he might not be able to fix no matter what . If that 's the case ... we need to know . You want me to share Unity with him ? No , I can 't . The last time I wasn 't strong enough to overcome Scorpius 's evil . The evil is gone now . The chip may have been removed , but the evil may still remain . If that is true , we still need to know . You 're not alone now , Zhaan . Delvian ... Delvian ... Listen to Crichton . Hear his pain . What should we do ? Should we help her break out of it ? I ... I don 't know . - Zhaan ! Go away . Go away , Zhaan . There 's no point . Come out of it ! Break Unity ! Goddess be with him . The Scorpius clone is still in his head . What ? How is that possible ? It didn 't work ! Why didn 't it work ? What did you do wrong ? They are never gonna do what 's necessary . You know what has to be done . We 're going to help you , John . Give me some wornak injectant . We 're going to get that frelling madman out of your mind . I can 't see any . But how about nahbert serum ? It 's just as fast and painless . Zhaan , what are you doing ? ! - Zhaan ! Zhaan , no ! Let me go ! Hold her , Stark . Crichton wants to die ! - Hold her ! No ! Zhaan stop this ! He wants to die ! Be calm ! Be calm ! John is in agony . He begged me to kill him . We have already lost Aeryn . We will not lose another . Why is Scorpius still in Crichton 's mind ? Well , the doc figures it 's like a neural bleed . The , ah , clone 's personality 's has been in there so long that his consciousness has , like , merged with Crichton 's . H - h-how interesting . Just remove it . Well , it 's ... it 's not that easy . You can 't just cut it out with a scalpel , sir . There 's only one merciful thing to do . Yeah . I would have to agree . All right , you two . Out ! Eh ? ! Get out ! And do not come back into this chamber . Right . Come on , girl . What shall we do ? Whatever we can . You . Restore his speech . But Crichton insisted ... no harm to donor ... You 're the one harming the donors ! Their souls are crying out , screaming out in pain ! No pain . I can hear them ! Effectively dead . That isn 't death at all . This ... And that ... that was mercy . His agony was far greater than yours . Now , my friend . Can you help John ? Can try . Well , go ahead . And as for you ... do not ... make me tongue you . You look pretty rounched . I need air . I will go outside and meditate . Yeah , now , the weather 's cold . Getting worse . Cold does not bother me . Pa 'u Zhaan , anything to report ? Not yet , Crais . Still in orbit ? Go chase that bastard Scorpius . Their trail is cold . Talyn and I have found nothing to suggest a vector . So ? What are you doing here , then ? We await the delivery of the remains of Officer Sun . For the burial in space she would have wanted . Fine . I 'll load her coffin onto your Transport Pod and , uh , Zhaan can bring her up to ya . I cannot face such a task right now . Help me out , eh ? I 'm trying to get rid of that yarbo and his gunship from my planet . I don 't trust ' em . When we all leave , we will take Aeryn Sun with us . Huh . If you all leave . I thought you weren 't hungry . I was until I started eating . You want some ? - No . Come on . It will put color in your cheek . No . Come on . We 'll die of boredom but we 'll be well fed . What did you do that for ? I don 't know . Think . Well , maybe I don 't like being taken care of . Maybe I don 't like being bitten . Yeah , well , then keep your hands out of my face . Keep your hands out of my food . Hey , I helped make that ! Too bad ! Still bored ? Stop it ! You better ... You better let go . Otherwise , I ... I 'm going to have to bite something else . You 'll lose an arm . You 'll lose worse than an arm . You wouldn 't do that ... Don 't tell me what I ... what I would or wouldn 't do ... I do as I please . Okay . Do whatever you want . Done . Damage repaired . Speech should return . Should ? Will know soon . Hey where are you going ? Must excrete . D ... D ... D 'Argo . Aeryn 's gone . I want to die . Aeryn died so that you could live , John . She would want you to keep fighting . Lost . Still hear Scorpy ... Listen to me . The chip 's out . Its tendrils are dead . The Scorpy in your head is merely a remnant , a ... an ... impudent wraith buzzing in your ear . You are stronger than he is . Show him . Hey , Harvey . Let 's have a little chat . I don 't wish to chat , John . I wish to leave . That is why you must die . Why don 't you kill me ? You did it before . Stopped my brain function cold . What 's the matter ? You lost your touch ? Circumstances are different now . Yes , they are . You got no connections , no backup , no power supply . No place to hide . I wanna make some rules now . Come on . Let me show you what I mean . Now John , you listen to me . Not this time , Scorpius . Brain ain 't big enough for the two of us . Look Crichton , I 'm warning you ... I 'm sorry , sweetheart . Come on , Scorpy . Come on , man . Show me that ugly grin . I 'm warning you , Crichton . Now , you stop . Oh , no , no , no , no , I don 't think so , remember ? Out with the old , in with the new ! Can I get a hell yeah ? ! Hell yeah ! It 's your time to pray , Scorpy . Oh , Crichton . Pray for your soul , Scorpy . If you have one . And pray for the soul of Aeryn Sun ! Crichton ! Shut up . Yeah ! Whoo ! One of the cryogenic pods is starting an autorelease sequence , eh ? Uh , nah . Can 't be . Let me talk to him . Sorry , Doc . Say again ? Full restoration ? You sure ? Nah . Nah , I-it must be a screwed-up sensor . Ha ... no . You get back and tend your patient , doc . I 'll deal with it . Doc , leave it to me . Doc , get out of there . I 'll handle it ! Doc ? Doc ! A Scarran ? Here ? Why ? Get frelled . Grunchlk . You can do one of two things with your mouth . The first is talk to me . And that is the second . All right . You know the Scarrans are after you . They found out this is where you had your cooling system installed . And they sent a spy who offered me currency to keep him hidden till you came back for a checkup . And you took his money . Just his advance . I was going to keep the dumb frell frozen and hand him over to you . But you didn 't . When your goons came in locked and loaded , I kind of doubted your good intentions . As insurance , I switched on the Scarran 's auto release , three arns delay . If you 'd behaved , and paid what we 'd agreed , I 'd have switched it off . I hope he kills you very slowly . Not likely . If my father finds out , we 're dead . - He won 't find out . What the hezmana happened in here ? Oh , we were ... we were making some ... some sork wings and ... and the pot exploded . You blew up a cook pot ? We used too much lutra oil . The grolack 's fine , though . Nice and crispy . Here . Sit down and eat . Ah , I 'll give the ... ah , I 'll give the sork wings another try . I 'll , uh ... consume this in a room without detonating crockery . Thank you very much . We 'd better clean this up . I guess so . Crichton , D 'Argo and Stark are in the surgery room . Now the Scarran is in the cryo-chamber , level four . Shall I take care of it , sir ? With that ? He 'll saute you , son . He 's never taken on a Scarran , has he ? No . Have you ? I beat him . He was all mouth , Stark . How 'd you know ? I didn 't . I just thought it sounded good . Well , it worked . Harvey 's caged . Come on , let 's pay the bill and get the hell out of here . I will find Zhaan . Plonek ! Ithrawan Plonek ! I 'm alone ! I got a present for you ! Ooh ! Grunchlk , where is Scorpius ? He 's not here . Then why did you release me ? Well , I ... I ... I 've ... I 've got someone almost as good . John Crichton . Do you know who that is ? Yes . Scorpius seems obsessed with him . We want to know why . Why don 't you ask him ? He 's in the surgery room recovering . No ! No ! Ohh ! Are you lying ? Is this a trap ? No , no , no . No trap . Where is Scorpius ? Scorpius isn 't here . Scorpius isn 't here , I told you . But I 'm sure he 's on his way back to the planet to capture Crichton . - to capture Crichton . Who is with Crichton ? Just a Luxan and the Banik slave . I might have use for you later . That should divert the Scarran away from us . Officer Kobrin , we 've received vital information which I must deliver to my Command Carrier . Sir , the carrier is now much closer . I am certain we can outrun the gunship long enough to reach it safely . You have that much faith in your piloting skills ? My last rating was 991 , sir . No active pilot rates higher . Your skills will be tested , very soon . Stark , look at these indicators . The cryo-system is activated to preserve the body until burial . But that 's not all . The cellular maintenance functions are still operating keeping her body alive . Why ? Unless Grunchlk was intending to keep her here as a donor . I wouldn 't put it past him . No , the Diagnosian pronounced her dead . He could not save her . His gifts could not . I could hear the distant voices of the Interons , but I cannot hear Aeryn Sun 's . If her soul has not fled entirely it 's much too far away to be reached . Even the attempt would be dangerous . Yes , you 're probably right . Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers . - Zhaan . Stark ! Why don 't they answer ? Zhaan ? Stark ? What 's the delay ? D 'Argo ! Where the hell did that come from ? A Scarran . We have no weapons so I suggest a tactical retreat . That looks like an exit . Door controls . You didn 't bring any weapons ? I only brought down my Qualta Blade . It 's still sealed . Well , how am I supposed to know about that ? Wait ! There 's a hatch . Whoa ! I hate the cold . Freeze or fry . Freeze . Sir , the diversion 's working . The Scarran is moving outside in pursuit of Crichton and D 'Argo . However , two of the others are now blocking our path to the surface . If they see us and notify Crais . Two Commandos from the Marauder coming from this approach could take them out and still maintain a zero-presence profile . Summon them . No sign of the Scarran . Do you think he 's following ? Better hope he is . - Sounds like you got a plan . We 're going to bring him out here and see how he likes being in the cold . And what if he likes it ? Look ! One plan at a time ! All right . Forgive me , Stark , but I need your strength . I knew you would never allow me to risk this . Do you know who I am ? Do you know who you are ? Officer Aeryn Sun , Special Peacekeeper Commando , Icarian Company , Pleisar Regiment . Have you come to reassign me ? I 've come to take you back . Zhaan , what is this ? Unity , Aeryn . The sharing of minds and souls . As our thoughts merge , you will understand . I understand that you shouldn 't be here . Nor should you . Why are you doing this ? Because I love you . More importantly , Crichton loves you . You must take this gift , not for my sake , but for his . I can 't . I know your thoughts . And I know what this will cost you . Stop resisting , Aeryn . Accept this . No . No ! Aeryn ! We 'll take Stark with us . Capture or terminate ? Keep the Banik alive . Terminate the Delvian . You 're back . You 're back . Oh , Zhaan . Success . - Success . Where are the others ? Surgery . Report . The Commandos are dead , Lieutenant . Even if Crais is now aware of our presence the Scarran won 't stay diverted forever . Officer Kobrin . We can wait no longer . Yes , sir . Here he comes ! I don 't think he likes the cold either ! Warm up the hot cocoa , baby . Here we come . It 's jammed ! I can 't believe this ! You have got to be kidding me ! Unjam it . What ? What are you gonna do ? Frell . Yes , Talyn . I see it . That is a vessel leaving the planet . No , a Transport Pod would not be attempting a stealth trajectory . Pursue . That 's my Qualta blade . Can 't be , you left it in the coffin ! Hey ! Hey , horse face ! D 'Argo . No ! You 're gone . It 's me , John . But it can 't be you . This is some kind of a trick . She died . Zhaan brought me back . She did a Unity thing . Zhaan . Zhaan ? You 're alive . Crais , cease this pursuit at once . This pursuit will end in your death , Scorpius . Aboard this Marauder is information that will help us defeat the Scarrans . You may have foresworn the Peacekeepers , but before you act , consider your fellow Sebaceans . You consider one Sebacean who died at your hands , Officer Aeryn Sun . Yes , Talyn , I see it . Command Carrier . Crais , you destroy this ship , and my Command Carrier will destroy you . Possibly . Talyn ! Are we in agreement ? ! Fire ! Pilot ... Scorpius is dead . His Command Carrier is now in pursuit of Talyn . We 'll draw it away from your position before we Starburst . Scorpius is dead ? Yes . Officer Sun is avenged . Are you certain , Pilot ? Yes . Moya confirms it . Before Starbursting , Talyn told her that he destroyed Scorpius 's Marauder . Damn shame on two counts . Too quick , and I wasn 't there to see it . D 'Argo , I 'm with Zhaan . Did you find Tocot ? Yes . He 's dead . And what about Grunchlk ? He 's dead , too . Effectively . Then we 're gonna take these two with us . The Interons ? Why ? One of them died because of me . What , and you think they can be saved ? You were . A signal from the Command Carrier , sir . Moya and Talyn have both fled . A Prowler detail is on its way to pick us up . The Marauder ? - Destroyed . Plainly Officer Kobrin overestimated his piloting skills . Well , perhaps Talyn is more formidable than we thought . Sir , Crais must be ... First Command has already taken care of that situation . Our task is much more important . We have a new Gammak Research Base ready to go into operation . Hundreds of techs , all waiting to apply this ... priceless information . Let 's not keep them waiting , Lieutenant . Taste all right ? That frelling planet got me so chilled I still can 't smell anything , but ... it is warming me up . Mine is more than adequate . All the time you two spent in here was ... ultimately productive . Two excellent cooks . I couldn 't be luckier . Well , I could . That frelling Grunchlk . I paid for services and they were not rendered . I 'm delighted he 's dead . Finished making your rounds ? Mm-hmm . I shouldn 't be here . This is exactly where you should be . I love you . I love you , too . We will not act on it . Aeryn ? My Peacekeeper training was right about one thing . Soldiers and emotional attachments in battle may distort your thinking . We 're not in battle , Aeryn . Scorpius is ... What happens ... What happens when Moya comes into contact with more Scarrans ? Or Nebari or Sheyangs or something worse ? I will not be the cause of any more deaths because my judgment was faulty . I will not permit anyone else to sacrifice their life for mine . What do you mean , anyone else ? Hello , John . Aeryn just told me that , uh ... whatever you did to bring her back ... A gift of spiritual energy . Yes . And it took everything that you had . Is there anything we can do to help ? Nothing . I will not accept that . I have , John . I 'm dying .

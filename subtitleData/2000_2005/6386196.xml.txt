 Hey , you guys , why is everything so red on valentine 's day ? I mean , the greeting cards and the candy . Even the tire ads . Well , red represents all the blood that was spilled at the massacre . Massacre ? Yeah , the st . Valentine 's day massacre . It was a very big deal here on earth . Well , all I know is at school , everybody says valentine 's day is designed to maximize the lovin ' . What about people like you who never get any lovin ' ? Yes , well , that 's all about to change . Because this valentine 's day is about me and Alissa maximizing the lovin and minimizing ... the virginity . Yes ! It 's about time . I 've been telling you to do that since you were 14 . Hey , guys ! Hey , Alissa , how you doing ? Ahh ... cake in the oven ! Oh , will you , uh ... look at the time ? Harry ? Hmm ? Oh , I was just trying to stagger my exit for a more natural effect . ♪ La la la la la la la ♪ and I 'm out ! What 's going on ? Uh , I 've just been thinking about what we should do for valentine 's day . Oh , that 's sweet . Yeah , so ... so , like , up all night trying to craft the best way of saying this . Alissa , do you want to get a hotel room ? Tommy , it better be a nice hotel room . Really ? Are you serious ? Yeah , I mean , I think we 're ready , don 't you ? Yes , yeah . No , I do . I really do . And absolutely it 'll be a nice hotel room . I mean , after all , it 's our first time . Oh ... your first time . What--what ? Thank you . So , Mary , what do you want for valentine 's day this year ? Oh ... I 'm not expecting much . Why not ? Well , the first year we dated , you claimed to have never heard of valentine 's day . The second year you gave me a ham sandwich . That 's why I 'm not expecting much . I 'm so sorry . Mary , this year I 'll try to get it right . You know I love you . Yeah , I know . Hey . Oh , tiffany , you finally made it ! Oh , Dick , this is my niece tiffany . She 's staying with me for the week . Sorry I 'm late . Aunt Mary , can I have 20 bucks ? Uh , you 're not going to join us ? No . Oh , Ok . But be home by 10 : 00 . My rules . That 's not going to happen . Have fun . Sweet girl . She 's a pain in the ass . My therapist said I had to set limits with her . Therapist ? Why are you seeing a therapist ? To talk . About me ? Oh , Dick ... about our relationship ? Dick , please ! Oh , my god ! You 're talking about me ! Yes--no ! Dick , that 's between me and my therapist . But tell me ! No ! Please ! No ! So what are you going to eat ? That 's between me and my waiter . Hey , Don ! Sally , look what I found on the porch . It says it 's from your secret admirer . Secret admirer ? Hey , you guys , get in here ! You sure you want to read that in front of everyone ? Hey , what 's going on ? Look what some weirdo left on the porch ! Let me see that . " Dear Sally , " I can 't stop thinking about you . Whoa , this guy sounds obsessed ! Don : but , uh- - " I stay up at night just to watch you sleep . " Sally- - eww ! " On this valentine 's day your heart will be mine . " Aah ! Don : no , you don 't understand . This is the most creepy , horrible , disgusting thing I have ever encountered ! It 's a good thing you 're dating a cop . Yes , it is , yes . Don , should we go outside and look for clues ? Clues ? Sure , why not ? Oh . So I got Alissa and me a room at the Ramada . Attaboy ! She 's totally fine with it . Attaboy ! But I 'm a virgin . Attaboy ! And , you know , she 's not . Atta- - stop it ! What , you mean the pointing or the actual- - everything ! I don 't know what to do , man . She 's so much more experienced than me . What if I make a fool of myself ? Oh , don 't worry . You will . So , Dick , what would you like to talk about ? Mary Albright . Ok . What does she talk about when she comes here ? I can 't discuss patients , Dick . Doctor-client privilege is the foundation of trust in psychotherapy . Oh , that ... makes perfect sense . I respect that . How about I ask you questions about Mary , and you nod your head yes or no ? No . Was that a yes ? No . Was that a no ? Yes ! Yes ! Good , good . Dick , what 's really going on ? What do you mean ? Are you feeling insecure about something ? Like what ? I don 't know . You tell me . My relationship with Mary ? Yes ? No . Was that a yes ? [ Wailing ] Yes ! [ Sobbing ] Ohhh ! Hello . Is Tommy here ? Yeah , I 'm Tommy . Hi . Uh , do I know you ? I 'm tiffany . Aunt Mary wanted to get rid of me , so she told me to come over here and hang out with you . Uh-huh . Well , I got some homework to do , so ... you 're a cutie . Not exactly big-boned , but really hot . Thanks . I 'm bored . Let 's do something . Right . That 's the thing- - I got this stuff to do , so- - come on , stop being so lame all the time . You just met me . How old are you ? 18 . Make me a sandwich ? Uh ... we--we got turkey . [ Humming ] Don , what 's going on ? Huh ? Have there been any breaks in the case ? Uh , uh , no , Sally . Uh , but I 've got every available man on it . What about a handwriting expert ? Don 't you guys have some sort of handwriting expert that can take a look at this thing ? A handwriting expert ? Sally , we 're just a small police department , and I , uh ... I 'm the handwriting expert . Uh , here , let me take a look at that . Aha ! Given the slope of this crossed " t , " we can definitely conclude that this guy is a lover , not a loser , Sally . Really ? I don 't know . Curve of the " v " says he 's a pervert . And the capital " y " says he 's killed and will kill again . Rico ! I knew it ! Don , I cannot sleep knowing that he is out there . Please find him for me . Just find him . Boy , oh , boy . You better find that perv . I 'm the perv . The first time I saw Mary undress , I remember thinking , " god , I hope this skylight holds . " Would you consider your relationship with Mary to be a happy one ? Yes . Apart from the occasional mishap . Mishap ? You know , like me publicly accusing her of murder or ... or showing up naked at one of her fund-raisers . So those weren 't Mary 's delusions . I beg your pardon ? Go on . I mean , I try so hard to do the right thing , but inevitably my choice is " the worst thing imaginable . " Her words . How does that make you feel ? Frustrated . Why ? Because I want ... because I want to be a good human being . And what 's stopping you ? I don 't know . You ? No . Me ? Good ! And ? And ... where I came from . Yes , of course ! It 's where I 'm from ! And ? It 's my past ! That 's it ! My past is stopping me from being a good human being . Go on . It 's standing between me and my happiness with Mary . Go on . I 've got to let go of my past ! That 's it ! I 'm letting go of my past ! Go on . Go on ? I 've just made a huge breakthrough ! Isn 't that enough ? Food , clothing , shelter . The basics turn me on . Shelter turns you on ? Yeah . Because you need those things or you 'll die . But sometimes it feels like if you have them , you 'll die . Wait , how do you mean ? Well , you can have shelter all day long , but if you don 't go outside once in a while , you go crazy . Oh , right . And you could eat like a pig , but then sometimes you have to stop , right ? And clothing . Yeah ? Well , sometimes , don 't you just have to be naked ? I 've got a girlfriend . I 've got a boyfriend . We 're gonna have sex on valentine 's day . No . We 're gonna have sex right now . I 'm a virgin . I could educate you . I could use an education . Let 's go . Ok ! Alissa is gonna be so happy about this . I have an announcement to make . Ay yi yi . Oh , jeez . I have spent my entire life as a human on the outside looking in . Always trying , approximating , attempting , but never being a human being . That 's ' cause you 're not . Lieutenant , I refuse to be defined by who I am . My past has always gotten me into trouble . As of now , I have no past . I am no longer an alien . What ? From now on , I am a human being . I am john Q. Pubic . So let me ask you this : if you 're not an alien anymore , am I still an alien ? I 'm not here to define you or anyone . But I will say this : all the cool kids are no longer aliens . I 've gotta change . Only one more shopping day before valentine 's , and this time , I 'm getting it right . What are you getting for Don ? Ooh , I 'm thinking ham sandwich . Great idea . Hey , that 's what you got Mary last year . Yeah , when I was A ... [ Beeping ] Alien . So , uh , I was Ok ? You 're a natural . Really ? But in the genetic imperative kind of way , or are we talking style points here ? Both . I gotta go . Take care . W-wait . Wait . So , this is like good-Bye and good luck ? Yeah . What a deal ! [ Laughs ] Hey , Tommy ! What do you know ? Well ... a lot more than I did 2 hours ago . Oh ! Nothing says I love you like having sex with a stranger the night before you 're supposed to do it with your girlfriend for the very first time on valentine 's day . Yeah . Yeah . I 'm so thoughtful . Yeah . Look , have you caught the guy who wrote the note yet ? Caught him ? Oh , uh , yeah , sure . I nailed him . He 's in lock-up . Your worries are over . Oh , thank you so much ! I want to see him . Y-you can 't . Uh , nobody 's allowed in there . It 's too dangerous . I 'm going in . Sally , Sally ! Sally ! All right , Don , which one is he ? Sally , I- - I know how- - which one 's the perv ? Uh , the one in the red flannel . He 's your man . Ok , flannel boy , yeah , step over here . So you 're the one who 's been stalking me , huh ? Well , you have messed with the wrong broad , baby ! You have made my life a living hell , and you will suffer the wrath- - Sally , for god 's sake , stop it ! What is it , sweetie ? I was the one who wrote the note . You ? I thought it would be better than a card . I wanted to say it in my own words . You wrote ... " dear Sally , " I can 't stop thinking about you . " I stay up at night ... just to watch you sleep . " Both : " on this valentine 's day ... your heart will be mine . " Oh , my god , that is so sweet . Thanks . I tried . Let 's go . You could never write a valentine that good , you creep . Oh , hi , Dick . Oh , Mary . Happy , happy valentine 's day . Wow , Dick , this looks like a real present . I put a lot of thought into it . Oh ! Oh , my god , this is amazing . Oh , I knew you 'd love it . When I was 5 , I wanted a piano just like this , but my mother wouldn 't get it for me . Here 's another one , Mary . Oh , my god ! Do you know what this is ? Yeah , it 's the novel that your professor wrote while you were having an affair with him in college . How did you know that ? And here is a flowing black wig . Your camp counselor wouldn 't let you play maria in west side story , but I will . I never told you any of these things . But you told your therapist , who is now my therapist . You 're seeing my therapist ? Yeah . You betcha . And she told you all of this ? Oh , of course not . Mary , that would be completely unethical . I looked at your files while she went to the bathroom . I can 't believe this . What do you mean ? People don 't do this . People don 't look at other people 's psychological files to get gift ideas ! They don 't ? [ Shrieking ] No ! Wait a minute , Mary ! Are you sure ? Oh , stupid alien ! Stupid , stupid , stupid ! [ Piano plinks ] [ Plink ] [ Plink plink plink ] [ Clang ] [ Knock on door ] Hello , my valentine . Hello , my Valentino . So , this nice enough for you , huh ? Set me back $ 47.99 . Listen , I , uh , I have a present for you , because I wanted tonight to be really special . Really ? What is it ? Last night ... I lost my virginity . You what ? And if tonight is anything like last night , you 're gonna have one great time . Why would you do this ? Oh , I did it for you . For me ? Yeah , you know , because you 're such an experienced woman . You don 't want a boyfriend who doesn 't know what he 's doing , you know ? I thought you 'd be happy . Happy ? Not quite happy . I have to go think about this . Ok . Well , don 't be long ! Oh , I 'm gonna be very long ! Good thing I got pay-per-view . [ Music on Tv ] [ Knock on door ] Alissa . Hola , Mon frère ! Harry . So How 'd it go ? Uh , I think she was a little intimidated by me . What do you mean ? I think she felt like I had too much experience . Aw , ain 't no such thing , little buddy . Oh ! Those 2 ladies naked ? Yes , they are . Ah ! So , what 'd that guy do to deserve the spanking ? Thank you for agreeing to this emergency session . So what happened ? Dick read your file on me . He touched my things ? I feel so betrayed . I can 't trust these freaks to sit while I take a leak ! What did you just say ? What did you think I just said ? Dr. Brand , I need to talk to you ! Dick , you have to wait your turn ! No , this can 't wait ! Oh , this is infuriating ! Dick , what compelled you to invade my personal space ? Oh , and read Mary 's files ? I did it because I am a man who will do irrational , often annoying things out of love for Mary Albright . Why can 't you just act like a normal human being ? ! Because I 'm never going to be a normal human being , Mary ! And do you know why ? Because I 'm lousy at it ! And you 're just gonna have to accept that . Don 't listen to him , Mary . I 'm happy with myself . I don 't want to alter who I am . I like me . Get that down , Dr. Brand . So you 're saying you 're never gonna change . Dick Solomon , love him or leave him . You 've got a choice , Mary . Oh , Dick , I do love you . And I know what would happen if I ever tried to leave you . Yeah . Irrational and annoying things . Yeah . I wouldn 't normally say this , but you two should not be together . Happy valentine 's day , Mary . Happy valentine 's day , Dick . So how are things with Alissa ? Well , she hasn 't called yet . Which I 'm reading as smooth sailing . She 's just going to have to accept you for who you are . Wait . Is a non-alien speaking ? 'Cause I cannot hear a non-alien up here on the alien rooftop . Sally , I 'm an alien again . Good , ' cause that other thing was stupid . Not as stupid as Sally being scared by a valentine . Hey , I did not know the earth custom on that one , all right ? Isn 't it great to always have that excuse ? Yes , it definitely is . [ All making kooky noises ]

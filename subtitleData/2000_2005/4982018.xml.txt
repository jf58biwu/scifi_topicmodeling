 Bingo . Fucking hell . Fucking hell . Oh , God . Keep your shit together ... if you wanna get ' em out of here . I can pop these , no problem ! So get to it ! Security , we have a break-in . Get to sector ... I know who you are . I know what you think you 're doing ... If you don 't wanna get hurt ... keep your mouth shut ... and don 't move a fuckin ' muscle . The chimps are infected ! They 're highly contagious . They 've been given an inhibitor . Infected with what ? In order to cure , you must first understand . Infected with what ? ! Rage . What the fuck he 's talking about ? ! We don 't have time for this ! Get the cages open ! No ! No ! No ! Listen , you sick bastard . We 're going , and we 're taking ... your torture victims with us . We 're gonna get you out of here . Listen , the animals are contagious . The infection is in their blood and saliva . One bite-Stop ! Stop ! You 've no idea ... Aah ! No ! Get it off ! Oh , God ! Help me ! Get it off ! Get it off ! I 'm burning ! What the fuck is the matter with her ? ! We have to kill her ! Aah ! Oh , my God ! Aah ! What 's the matter with her ? ! We have to kill her now ! Oh , God . Aah . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? ! Hello ? ! Hello ? Hello ? Father ? Father , are you okay ? Oh , I shouldn 't have done that . I shouldn 't have done that . Shit ! — Over here ! — Move it ! Over here ! Come on ! Burn ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Keep going ! What the fuck is going on ? Just shut up ! Who are those people ? Wha-hoo ! Let 's go . Let 's go ! Please tell me what the fuck is going on . Just move ! Come on ! A man walks into a bar with a giraffe . They each get pissed . The giraffe falls over . The man goes to leave . The barman says , " Oi ... you can 't leave that lyin ' there . " He says , " No , it 's not a lion . It 's a giraffe . " He 's completely humorless . You two should get on like a house on fire . So , who are you ? Well , you 're from a hospital , yeah ? You 're a doctor . He 's not a doctor . He 's a patient . Look , I 'm a bicycle courier . I was riding a package from , uh , Farringdon ... to Shaftesbury Avenue when a car cut across me . And then I wake up today in hospital . I wake up , and I 'm ... I 'm hallucinating , or I 'm ... What 's your name ? Jim . I 'm Mark . This is Selena . Okay , Jim ... I 've got some bad news . It started as rioting ... and right from the beginning ... you knew this was different ... because it was happening ... in small villages , market towns . And then it wasn 't on the TV anymore . It was in the street outside ... it was coming through your windows . It was a virus , an infection . You didn 't need a doctor to tell you that . It was the blood . Or something in the blood . By the time they tried to evacuate the cities ... it was already too late . The infection was everywhere . The army blockades were overrun . And that 's when the exodus started . The day before the TV ... and radio stopped broadcasting ... there were reports of infection ... in Paris and New York . You didn 't hear anything more after that . What about the government ? What are they doing ? There 's no government . Of course there 's a government . There 's always a government . They 're in a bunker or a plane . No , there 's no government ... no police ... no army ... no TV , no radio , no electricity . You 're the first uninfected person ... we 've seen in 6 days . Where 's your family ? They 're dead , like Selena 's ... yours will be dead , too . No . Look , I have to find them . They live in Deptford . I can walk it , okay ? What , you 'll go and come back , yeah ? Get the fucking-Fuck ! — You won 't ! — Yes ! No one ever comes back . So , lesson one : You never go anywhere alone ... unless you 've got no choice . And lesson 2 : Only travel during daylight ... unless you 've got no choice . We 'll take you tomorrow . We 'll all go and find your dead parents together , okay ? Eat . If you want to slow down ... you 'll have to say . If there 's anyone in there who is ... I understand . Anyone . I understand . Okay . Jim . Wait , Jim . They died peacefully . You should be grateful . I 'm not grateful . My , um ... parents and my sisters ... we went to Paddington Station ... hoping maybe we could get on a plane ... maybe we could buy our way onto a plane . I remember my dad had all this cash ... even though cash was completely useless . About 20,000 other people ... had the same idea . The crowd was surging . I lost my grip on my sister 's hand . I remember the ground was soft . I looked down , and I was standing ... on all these people , like a carpet ... people who had fallen . And somewhere in the crowd ... there were infected . It spread fast . No one could run . All you could do was climb ... climb over more people . So I did that ... I climbed , and I got up on top of this kiosk . Looking down , you couldn 't tell ... which faces were infected ... and which weren 't . Then I saw my dad ... not my mum or my sister , my dad . His face . Selena 's right . You should be grateful . We don 't have time ... to get back to the shop before dark . We should stay here tonight . My room is up at the top . You two can have that . I 'll stay here . No , we 'll all sleep in the same room . It 's safer . It was recorded ... at the Buxton Summer Music Festival last July ... and it 's presented by Petrov Trelawny . Jim . Ah , you 're back . Yeah . How was it ? Fine . Give me a drink of that , will you ? It 's empty . Ah . Here . Right . I 'll start working on them , then . Fight ! Fight ! Selena ! It 's clear . That 's Mr. Bridges . Were you bitten ? That 's his daughter . They live 4 doors down . Were you bitten ? No . Did any of the blood get in your mouth ? No . Mark ? Wait . Get that cleaned off . Do you have any clothes here ? Um , l-yes . Then get them and get dressed . We have to leave now . More infected will be coming . They always do . How did you know ? I mean , how did you know he was infected ? The blood . Yeah , but there was blood everywhere . It was on me . It was on you . I didn 't know he was infected , okay ? He knew . I could see it in his face . Look , if someone gets infected ... you 've got between 10 and 20 seconds to kill them . It might be your brother or your sister ... or your oldest friend . It makes no difference . And just so you know where you stand ... if it happens to you , I 'll do it in a heartbeat . He was full of plans . Have you got any plans , Jim ? Do you want us to find a cure and save the world ... or just fall in love and fuck ? Plans are pointless . Staying alive 's as good as it gets . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . What 's that ? Let 's go . What is it about tower blocks ... and shopping trolleys , huh ? Stop talking . It 's a long way up . Do you need a break ? No . — You ? — No . Now I do need a break ... by the way . What 's up ? Nothin ' . Got a headache . Bad ? Yeah , it 's pretty bad . Well , why didn 't you say something before ? Well , because I didn 't think you 'd give a shit . You 've got no fat on you ... and all you 've had to eat is sugar ... so you 're crashing . Unfortunately , there isn 't a lot ... we can do about that ... except pump you full of painkillers ... and give you more sugar . As for sugar , Pepsi or Lilt ? Do you have any Tango ? Actually , I did have a can of Tango somewhere . Quiet ! That 's an infected . Oh , no . They 're in . Move ! Wait , Selena ! Wait for me , please ! Wait , Selena ! Please wait for me ! — Selena ! — Come on ! — Wait ! — Run ! Wait , for fuck 's sake ! Selena ! Aah ! Down the corridor , flat 157 ! Move ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Open up ! Where 's Dad ? What ? ! Open the fucking door ! Where 's Dad ? ! Fucking open the door ! Hannah , let them inside . Go in . Go in . So , I 'm Frank , anyway . Jim . Selena . Selena , good to meet you . This is my daughter Hannah . Come on , sweetheart . Say hello . Come on . So ... This is great . It 's just great . Calls for a celebration , I 'd say . Why don 't you all sit down ... and , uh , Hannah , what have we got to offer ? We 've got Mum 's crème de menthe . Great . Her crème de menthe . Aye . Look , sit , please . Get comfortable . Where are the bloody glasses ? ! Middle cupboard . No , the good ones . It 's a celebration . Top cupboard . So ... So , this is your place ? It 's nice . Yeah . Now ... I know it isn 't much , but , well , cheers . Cheers . You okay in there , Jim ? Yeah . Sorry we couldn 't spare the water . Same with the toilet . The , urn , flush doesn 't work . Afraid you 'll have to use the bucket . Have to empty it each morning , you know . Just chuck it over the balcony . No mod cons here . Yeah . It 's fine . Yeah , all right , listen ... it 's late . I 'm gonna turn in . We have a spare room ... in there . Are you and Selena ... Oh , no . No , no , no . Um , no , I 'll take the living room . It 's fine . Right . Oh , no , I mean , yeah . Yeah , so , um , all right . Okay , good night , then , anyway . Yeah , good night , Frank . Very spruce . Yeah ... very shredded . Yeah . So what do you make of them ? Well , they 're desperate . Probably need us more than we need them . I think they 're good people . Good people ? Yeah . Well , that 's nice ... but you should be more concerned ... about whether they 're gonna slow you down . Right , because if they slowed you down ... I 'd leave them behind . — In a heartbeat . — Yeah . I wouldn 't . Then you 're gonna wind up getting yourself killed . I 'm gonna get some sleep . Selena ... you think I don 't get it ... but , um , I do get it . And I know I 'd be dead already ... if I hadn 't met you . Sure . No , look ... I mean thank you . And I mean sure . Good night , Jim . Good night . We lost water pressure 3 weeks ago . For a while , I thought we 'd be okay ... with the water in the other flats ... cisterns , and tanks ... but it vanishes so quick , you wouldn 't believe . You drink it . It evaporates ... turns stagnant . They 're all empty . Hasn 't rained in 10 days . You can set up a plastic sheet ... to catch dew and condensation ... trap it somehow . I saw it on TV once , but I can 't make it work . You 'd never think it ... needing rain so badly . Not in fucking England . Jim , we 're not gonna be able to stay here . There haven 't been any broadcasts for weeks . Just listen . ... Salvation is here . The answer to infection is here . If you can hear this , you 're not alone . There are others like you . There are fighters , other survivors . We are soldiers , and we are armed . Oh , my God . Soldiers . Quiet . There 's more . Our location is the 42nd Blockade ... the M602 , 27 miles northeast of Manchester . You must find us . Salvation is ... Then it just repeats . What , so it 's a recording ? Yeah , it 's a recording ... but this is where it 's telling us to go . Just there . The way things are ... we might need 2 , 3 days to get up there . Um , " we " ? Sound carries in this flat . You know , jerry-built , I suppose . Me and Hannah do need you ... more than you need us . Look , I didn 't ... That 's okay . It 's the truth . I can 't leave the block ... if it 's just the two of us . Something might happen to me . Hannah 'd be alone . I couldn 't risk it ... but with other people ... If it 's a recording , for all we know ... the soldiers who made it are dead . It 's possible , yeah . And that stuff about the answer to infection ... I mean , there is no answer to infection . It 's already done pretty much all the damage it can . Maybe they have a cure . Maybe they 've got nothing at all . Well , the only way to find out is to reach them ! We could die trying , Frank ! Or die here ... and anyway , it isn 't true what Dad said . You need us just the same as we need you . We need each other ... and we 'll never be safe in the cities . The soldiers could keep us safe . So we have to try and get there . Get there how ? Just so you know ... I don 't take checks or credit cards . What do you think ? Well , it 's the most direct route ... to the other side of the river . No , no , no , then we should take ... the indirect route ... the one that 's in broad daylight ... and that 's not underground . Let 's just get it done . No , no . No , see , this is a really shit idea . You know why ? Because it 's really obviously a shit idea . So , we 're just gonna drive into a tunnel ... full of fuckin ' smashed cars and broken glass . It 's just really fucking obviously a shit idea ! Hold on ! Dad ! — Aah ! — Whoa ! Fuck ! World 's worst place to get a flat , huh ? Agreed . I think we better do this quick . I 've got the wheel . You 're on the jack . Hey , did you hear that ? Hey , hey . Did you hear that ? Hear what ? Right , I 've done it . Dad ? Jesus Christ ! Oh , no ! Fucking rats ! Aah ! Come on , Hannah , out ! Out ! They 're running from the infected . Move it ! Forget the jack , Hannah ! Don 't look at them ! There 's no time ! Forget the jack ! Just lift , everyone ! Grab hold ! Lift ! Lift ! Lift ! Don 't look at them ! Don 't look at them ! I can see them ! They 're coming ! Aah ! Come on , Hannah ! Put it on ! Almost ! Get the tire on , Hannah ! — All right ! — Get it on , Hannah ! 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Drop it ! Inside , everyone ! Inside ! Get in the cab ! Get in the cab ! Get in the fucking cab ! Frank , drive ! Aah ! Whoo ! Bye-bye , you fuckers ! Whoo ! Hey , Frank , Frank , stop the cab . Let 's shop . Rrr ! Rrr ! You ... You ... You ... Has anybody seen any buns ? Mmm . Irradiated . And don 't take anything that needs to be cooked , okay ? I think you can eat that raw . Decaffeinated coffee . Put that back . Can 't just take any crap . If I never see another chocolate bar again ... it will be too soon . Not counting Terry 's chocolate orange , of course ! There . Now , single malt , 16-year-old . Dark , full-flavor . Warm , but not aggressive . Peaty aftertaste . Yeah . Takes out the fire , but leaves in the warmth . Ha ha ha . Either we do this now , or we 're walking . Not you . Stay close , Jim . What ? You heard me . Where are you going ? We 've got enough food , Jim . We don 't have any cheeseburgers . Like going on holidays with your fuckin ' aunt . Oh , Jesus . Hello ? I hate you ! Find anything ? Find anything , Jim ? No . Let 's get out of here . Okay , we 're done here . Okay , Hannah ! Steady . Easy . Brake . Brake ! Brake ! Out . Mmm ! Oh , my God ! I can , like , taste the vitamin " C. " Okay , the raisins are still moist . What did you say ? The raisins , yeah ? They 're still moist . Look over here . Like a family . Do you think they 're infected ? No . They 're doing just fine . Come on . Let 's eat ! Do you know what I was thinking ? You were thinking that you 'll never hear ... another piece of original music ever again . You 'll never read a book ... that hasn 't already been written ... or see a film that hasn 't already been shot . Urn , that 's what you were thinking . No . I was thinking I was wrong . About what ? All the death ... all the shit . It doesn 't really mean anything ... to Frank and Hannah , because ... Well , she 's got a dad ... and he 's got his daughter , so ... Cheeky monkey . I was wrong when I said ... that staying alive is as good as it gets . You see , that 's what I was thinking . Was it ? Mmm . You stole my thought . Sorry . That 's okay . You keep it . It 's getting late . Think we better stay here for the night . Can 't sleep . Me neither . Doesn 't feel safe , does it ? Outside like this . I think we 're safe enough . Selena didn 't seem to have any trouble . Yeah , I noticed that . Hey , Selena . What ? What is it ? How did you get to sleep ? Oh . Bloody hell . You must have needed ... a hell of a prescription for that lot . I didn 't need a prescription . I qualified as a chemist . Oh , great , Valium . Not only will we be able to get to sleep ... but if we 're attacked in the middle of the night ... we won 't even care . 2 each . No , not for me , thanks . Can I , Dad ? I don 't think so , sweetheart . Please ? No . I can 't sleep . Come on , Frank . Let her live a little . Give her half of one . All right . We 're on . Night-night . You 're a big softie , Frank . Frank ? Hannah ? Frank ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Shh . You 're having a bad dream , that 's all . Thanks , Dad . Come on , sleepyhead . Come on , Babe Ruth . Hurry up . Oh , no . Did I miss breakfast ? You 'll sleep through anything , you . Did you have a fry-up ? Maybe stop at a pub along the way ? Door . ... We can feed you and we can protect you . Our location is the 42nd Blockade ... the M602 , 27 miles northeast of Manchester . You must find us , please . Salvation is here . The answer to infection is here . — Sure ? — Yo . Must be Manchester . The whole of Manchester . The whole city . No fire crews to put it out . 42nd Blockade . This is it . I don 't understand , Dad . Did they leave ? I don 't like this . I think we should go . No ! Vehicles . We should check the vehicles . There has to be something . Nothing . Can 't believe it . Frank . Frank . We have to go ? Yeah . Go fucking where ? ! Get out of it . Get out of it . Dad , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine , sweetheart . Sorry I lost my temper . Hannah . I love you very much . What ? Keep away from me . Stay where you are . — Ow . — Dad ? — Keep away from me ! — Dad ? Keep away from me ! — Keep away from me ! — Dad ! — Keep away from me ! — Dad ! Keep away ! Keep away ! What 's wrong ? Dad ! Jim ! Jim , he 's infected ! No ! No ! Jim ! Jim , kill him ! — Dad ! — Kill him ! Kill him ! Stay away from him ! Keep away from the body ! Dad ? 3 survivors ... one male , 2 female . I repeat , one male , 2 female . ETA 15 . Put the kettle on . I 'm Major Henry West . Welcome . Jim . Hello , Jim . Hello . Well , we 've got beds with clean sheets ... and a boiler that produces hot water ... so you can all have a shower . You look like you need one . Please . It ain 't funny . I 've got loads of cooking to do . You fucking Doris . Please ! Run him over ! I want to start cooking . How 's she doing ? Well , she 's lost her dad , Jim . That 's how she is . It 's all fucked . What do you mean ? No , don 't do that . Don 't do that . Don 't ... Come on , come on , come on , come on . Hey , don 't do that . Look , Hannah is what Frank said she is , okay ? She 's tough , and she 's strong ... and she 'll cope just like I 'll cope ... and just like you 'll cope . I don 't want her to have to fucking cope . I want her to be okay . When Hannah had her dad , it was okay . It was okay for them , and it was okay for us . Now it 's all just fucked . So you heard our broadcast ? Yeah , we did . We must be a disappointment . You were hoping for a full brigade ... an army base with helicopters ... and a field hospital . I was just hoping for ... The answer to infection . Yeah . Well , as I said before , it 's here ... though it may not be quite what you imagined . Just feel very lucky to have found you . You were lucky . The fire drove hundreds of infected ... out of Manchester . The surrounding area is teeming with them . But don 't worry . You 're quite safe here . Flat terrain all around the house ... floodlights ... which we 've rigged up to a generator ... high perimeter wall , which helps ... and we 've been lacing the ground ... with trip wires and land mines . You wouldn 't want to mow the lawn ... but if they get in , we hear them . Secondary to protection ... our real job is to rebuild ... start again . The belly of the house ... the heart . A wood-fired boiler ... providing us with hot water ... the first step towards civilization . The kitchen . Here , I 'll swap you . A bit of Kendal Mint Cake , right ? Well , wait . Now , don 't be throwing it . Don 't be ... Now , don 't be fighting . Will you put that back ? Put it back . Jones , our resident tin-opener . What are you cooking , Jones ? Surprise , sir . I can 't wait . And lastly , meet Mailer . Mailer , Jim . Jim , Mailer . Got infected 2 days ago . Mitchell managed to knock him out cold ... and we got a chain around his neck . You 're keeping him alive ? The idea was to learn something about infection ... have him teach me . And has he ? In a way . He 's telling me he 'll never bake bread ... plant crops ... raise livestock . He 's telling me he 's futureless ... and eventually ... he 'll tell me how long the infected take ... to starve to death . Will there be chips or jacket spuds ? Will there be salad or frozen peas ? Will there be mushrooms ? Fried onion rings ? You 'll have to wait and see Hope it 's chips , it 's chips We hope it 's chips , it 's chips We hope it 's chips ... Hat . So ... what have we here ? Tinned ham , tinned peas ... tinned beans , and ... Nice one , Doris . Omelet . You 've prepared a feast , Jones . Honor of our guests , sir . Absolutely . I was going to propose a toast ... but this omelet will do just as well . To new friends . New friends . Jones , did you notice while cooking ... that these eggs were off ? I thought the salt might cover the taste , sir . Get rid of it . Doris , you twat . I don 't suppose you can cook , can you ? I can 't tell you how badly we need ... someone with a little flair in the kitchen . What a fucking disappointment . When I saw those eggs ... I thought it was Christmas . We 'll all have eggs again ... once everything 's back to normal . Oh , you muppet . I mean , look at him , eh ? Look , he 's still waiting ... for Marks and Spencer 's to reopen . Listen , mate , you don 't know nothing . Well , I think Bell 's got a point . If you look at the whole life of the planet ... we ... you know , man ... has only been around for a few blinks of an eye . So if the infection wipes us all out ... that is a return to normality . That what you meant , Bell ? Yeah , yeah . Have you , uh ... have you met our new-age sergeant ? Our spiritual guru . Tell me , Farrell ... exactly why did you join the army ... in the first place ? This is what I 've seen ... in the 4 weeks since infection ... People killing people ... which is much what I saw ... in the 4 weeks before infection ... and the 4 weeks before that ... and before that . As far back as I care to remember ... people killing people ... which , to my mind ... puts us in a state of normality right now . You 're not eating ? I don 't want to eat . You must eat , Hannah . I don 't want to eat . I want to bury my dad . He 's one of the people you 're talking about . Stand to ! Stand to ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Move it , men ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on , move ! Enemy front ! 2 , 3 ... 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Mitch , I fucking got one ! What do you want , a fucking sweetie ? Keep shooting , you cunt ! Fucking hell ! He bounced ! Cease fire ! I ain 't ever seen that in my fucking life ! Front 4 clear ? Fucking hell ! — Clear ! — Clear ! Clear , yeah , clear . Good , weren 't it , eh ? Hey , that was fucking marvelous . I 'm telling you , fucking marvelous . Oh , hello . Listen , sweetheart ... you ain 't gonna be needing this anymore . Eh ? 'Cause you got me to protect you now . Go on , Mitch . Go on . You wanna get your hands on a really big chopper ... well , you just come and see me . Fuck you . Well , that 's an offer , Mitch . Yeah , all right . How about right now ? Mitchell ! Easy , tiger . You don 't want to go picking a fight with me , son . Sergeant Farrell ! Mitchell , first action on ? Resecure the perimeter , sir . Then get to it . Jones , Bedford , go with him . Slow down . Sergeant . Sir . Clear the bodies off the lawn . The rest of you go with him . My apologies . Drink ? Look , we 're grateful , okay ? We 're very grateful for your protection ... and just having found other people ... but if we 're gonna stay here ... Who have you killed ? I haven 't killed anyone . Since it began , who have you killed ? You wouldn 't be alive now ... if you hadn 't killed somebody . I killed , uh ... I killed a boy . A child ? Yes . But you had to . Otherwise , he 'd have killed you . Survival . I understand . I promised them women . What ? 8 days ago , I found Jones ... with his gun in his mouth . He said he was going to kill himself ... because there was no future . What could I say to him ? We fight off the infected ... or we wait until they starve to death ... and then what ? What do 9 men do except wait to die themselves ? I moved us from the blockade ... I set the radio broadcasting ... and I promised them women ... 'cause women mean a future . Selena ? Hannah ? What is it , Jim ? We have to go ! Jim , wait ... No time ! Come on ! Come on ! Look , we get in the cab , and we go ! No ! You 're not gonna keep ' em here ! You 've got to let ' em go ! You cannot keep ' em here ! Stay where you are ! I 'll fuckin ' shoot you ! I 'm not gonna let you keep ' em here ! You can 't do this ! Don 't any of you move ! Get hold of him ! Get hold of him ! I can 't get hold of him ! Break his fingers . Knock him out ! I want to give you a chance . You can be with us ... but I can 't let them go . Okay , Jim ? Okay . Him , too . Marge walks onto this ship . Smithers says , " Women and seamen don 't mix " ... and Mr. Burns says ... " We all know what you think , Smithers . " And that was my favorite ever joke in The Simpsons . You see , that 's what they 're doing ... a few hundred miles from here across the channel ... a-across the Atlantic . They 're eatin ' dinner ... and they 're watchin The fuckin ' Simpsons . They 're sleeping in their beds next to their wives ... but we 're here ... chained to a fuckin ' radiator ... because the O.C. has gone insane ! Starting the world again ... when the rest of the fucking world hasn 't even stopped . Just imagine . Just think about it . How could infection cross the oceans ? How could it cross the mountains and the rivers ? They stopped it . And right now TVs are playing ... and planes are flying in the sky ... and the rest of the world ... is continuing as fucking normal . Think ... actually think about it . What would you do with a diseased little island ? They quarantined us . There is no infection . It 's just people killing people . He 's insane ! Time to go . Quarantine ? Ugh . Please . Believe me , I 'm not interested . You see , I 'm gonna have the black one ... and I 'm gonna make her squeal . Mitchell ... I swear to God it 's gonna end badly for you . Move . Come on . Move ! Get up ! Get up , you cunt ! Fucking move ! Get up ! Move your fucking ass ! Come on , then , you fucking pansies . Do me first . Maybe I won 't . Mitch , just use the gun . So , you 're gonna stick me , Mitchell ... is that it ? Mitchell , shoot him ! Why ? Because it 's fucking quicker ! Is that how you 're gonna let ... your sergeant go out , Jones ? I 'll fuckin ' shoot them , then . No , you won 't . You 're gonna let him stick me , are you ... like a fuckin ' dog ? I 'm gonna enjoy this . Aaaah ! You stupid cunt ! What are you doing ? What , you wanna shoot me , do you ? You wanna fuckin ' shoot me ? I 'll fuckin ' kill you , you little cunt ! Look ! Where 's he fuckin ' gone ? Fuck it ! Get up ! Get after him ! Jones , move ! Jones ! Move left ! I don 't see him . I don 't see him ! Where are you ? Where is he ? Okay , get back ! Where is he ? Jones , can you see him ? Through there ! Spray him ! Oh , no ... we 're fucked . We 're fucked ! Relax . He 's over the wall . He 's got no vehicle ... and no shooter . He 's dead . Ugh ! Now , the first thing we 're going do ... is make you look a little more presentable . It so happens that the lady of the house ... has an extensive wardrobe ... which she certainly has no use for . No ! You can 't do it to Hannah . Go to the master bedroom . Pick out a wide selection . Yes , sir . No . No . Ladies . Come on . It 's only dressing up . I thought girls liked dressing up . Expensive dresses , these are . Come on . Relax yourself . Selena ! Go on , Cliff . Selena ! Selena ! Go on , son . You need to leave me alone with Hannah . Okay ? Listen , right , the O.C. , he wants ... Yeah , he wants us to dress up nice . If you want us to get changed ... you have to leave the room . Okay ? It 's just polite . Yeah , yeah , all right . All right . Come on , lads . Let 's leave the room . Okay ... you 're gonna eat these , Hannah . Okay ? Come on . You eat these . Eat these . Are you trying to kill me ? No , sweetheart . I 'm making you not care . Okay ? What the fuck are you doing ? Someone 's at the blockade ! Jim ! Come on , move ! Stay here and put the dresses on . Well , let 's go ! Go ! He went over the wall . We thought he 'd be dead , sir . Shut up , Jones ! Stay here ! Ugh ! Davis ? Fuck it ! What was that ? Lightning . I heard something . It sounded like a claymore to me . All right . I 'll go and hit the floods , take a butcher 's . Girls ... keep an eye on him , will you ? Those pills ... I think they 're having an effect . I can feel them ... and ... I don 't feel sleepy ... but ... They 've been a long time . What are you gonna do if they don 't come back ? Would you be the officer if Henry is dead ? Is that the way it works ? Shut up . I don 't think they are coming back . I think they 've been killed . I said shut up ! Hannah . They 're dead ... and you 're gonna be next . Get up ! God ! We 're gonna get out of here . Stay with it , Hannah . Stay with it . Don 't worry . I feel fine . Really . Get him off me ! Get him off me ! It 's jammed ! It 's jammed ! Aah ! Oi ! Where the fuck are you going , eh ? What 's all the fuckin shouting ' about ? Well , don 't just stand there , you soppy cunt ! Get after 'em ! You two , in the house . Move ! Come on , then . What the fuck are you gonna do now ?

 I always say there 's three kinds of people in the world . Them who make things happen , them who watch things happen , and them who wonderwhat happened . I made things happen . The wrong things . I caused pain to anyone who came near me . This tattoo , it used to be my badge of honour . But I 'm a different man since Ijoined group . A better man . I never thought words like that would come out of my mouth . It 's all because of the help and the love that I found in this room . - You 're new here . Is it Ed ? - Yeah , I 'm new to this BS . Why do you think it 's BS ? Listen , man , I turned my life around . A lot of us here have . Our kind of lives go one way . And you can 't change , any more than you can undo the crimes you 've done . Well , I feel sorry for you , man . Don 't feel sorry . You 're going to hell just like I am , brother . Why are you here . Ed ? I drove Victor . He knows I 'm right . - Victor 's been doin ' good . - Oh , yeah . Just look at him . Victor , you wanna talk about it ? I 've just been having bad dreams . Really bad dreams . What kind of dreams ? Oh ... seeing people skinned alive . It 's a hard road . Victor . It 's a shock to the system , changing the way we think , taking charge of our lives . We 're all afraid , and that fear preys on us night and day , brother . In our minds and in our dreams . You ever get enough of that crap ? The " shock to the system " crap ? This " fear preying on us night and day " crap ? Those boys are afraid of one thing : themselves , their true natures . - You know what I 'm saying , Victor ? - Sorta . What do you mean ? Don 't tell me that bull does you any good . And don 't tell me you feel any better about yourself coming here , that it makes these nightmares go away . No ... it don 't . Hey . - Thanks for coming . Sorry about the hour . - Sounded like it couldn 't wait . No . I needed another set of eyes on it . I called Scully in , too . It 's a little late to be looking for a sitter . What 's so pressing ? Victor Dale Potts . Ex-con . Three-time loser . Career criminal . He was murdered five days ago . Scully 's got the crime report . - I 'm sorry , what am I missing ? - It 's the way he was killed . Agent Doggett . Agent Scully . I 'd like him to see the body . Damn ! I seen a bunch of these when I was a cop . It 's a favourite of Pan-Asian gangs . The difference is . Victor Potts had a premonition of his death . - And ? - That was my question . What I 'm saying is , this man was skinned alive just hours after describing it in detail . Maybe somebody had threatened him . He said it came in a dream , according to the woman who last spoke to him . - Who 's that ? - Dr Lisa Holland . She 's a therapist who runs an anger management group for ex-oons . A lifelong criminal 's bound to have some bad enemies , people capable of this . I mean , unless there 's something here that I 'm just not seeing . From my visual exam , the skin was removed with considerable skill , by someone using a hunting-type knife . Arteries and veins were left intact so as to prolong the period the victim would suffer . Terrible way to die , for sure . I know . Is there anything else , Agent Reyes ? Something special that brought this case to your attention as a possible X-File ? No . I just know I need to solve this , and I 'd appreciate your help . - Are you Reyes ? - I 'm Doggett . She 's Reyes . - Detective Van Allen ? - That 's right . - I appreciate your help on this . - What help is that ? - On this investigation . - There isn 't a lot to investigate . Victor Potts wasn 't one of the FBI 's Ten Most Wanted . I think she means your insight into the way he died . Don 't have any . But I 'm sure you 'd rather talk to somebody who actually gives a damn , right ? I hate to say it , but he probably sums up most people 's feelings . It 's hard for the Victor Pottses of the world . Nobody cares much about them in life or in death . Victor told the group a story , about a dream he 'd had . These men are haunted by their pasts . That 's why they 're here . But this dream came true . Sometimes the past they want to escape won 't let them . There was a man - Ed . He drove Victor to group that night . He was all over Victor 's case . You think he could have killed him ? I try to help these men . Some have been violent , some still are . It 's not my place to judge them . Dr Holland , there 'sjustioe to be served here . You can 't forget that . I 'm sure Agent Reyes won 't let me . Probably won 't let anybody . Thank you for your help . She contacted you with this case ? I think the police would have given up on who murdered Potts if it wasn 't for her . You know something , Agent Reyes ? You seem real familiarto me . Excuse me ? You ever visited Novi before ? No , I never have . You eyeballin ' me ? You got some kind of problem or somethin ' ? Problem ? Your friend is dead . Yeah . I guess the good news is I get to move up the ladder here now . You know how it happened . Now , why don 't you just back off ? The FBI wants to talk to me now because of the way he died . - They wanna talk to you , too . - I got nothin ' to tell nobody . - You were messing with his head . - I 'd watch what you go sayin ' . Orwhat ? You 're gonna do me , too ? I got a ride to catch . Yeah , that 's right , walk away . But , just like you said , you can 't run from what you are . Yeah ? And I 'll see you in hell . Here you go , Dr Scully . Everything you ever wanted to know about skinning people but were afraid to ask . This is every case of removal of the human dermis I could find within the last 12 years . - Most of these are postmortem skinnings . - That 's all I could find . Most of it 's Asian-gang related , like you mentioned . Wait a minute . What 's this ? I probably shouldn 't have included that one . It 's pretty much ancient history . There 's a pattern . The way the skin 's been stripped off , it 's identical . How could it be ? Did you notice the date ? 1960 . Excuse me ? Dr Muehler ? Dr Bertram Muehler ? Yes ? My name is Dana Scully . I 'm with the FBI . I want to ask you some questions about a John Doe you did an autopsy on in 1960 . You honestly expect me to recall some case from way back when ? I 'm 84 years old . Sir , this particular victim was skinned alive . In all my days , I never saw anything as inhuman as this . Sir , I haven 't located police records from the investigation . Was there ever a suspect who was charged or arrested in this case as far as you know ? No suspects . No investigation , for that matter . I don 't understand . The victim was a John Doe , a nobody . Carl Hobart , the county sheriff , figured he was a drifter . Hobart said he didn 't want to stir up the community . And no one called him on that ? I tried . The sheriff had other things on his mind , I suppose . Why do you say that ? It wasn 't long after that he put a bullet through his head . What are you thinking , Doctor ? This is some copycat murder , 40-odd years later ? If so , it 's the most perfectly executed that I 've ever seen . And why copy an obscure murder that nobody 's ever even heard of ? A string of murders . I 'm s orry ? I thought you knew . John Doe was only the first . Hey . I 'm workin ' in here . That you , Ed ? Come see what I got for ya . Tell you what , you best clear the hell out , whoever you are ! Hey ! Oh God ! Oh God , no ! Let me go ! Let me down ! Dr Holland ? Lisa ? Dr Holland ? Monica ? What the hell are you dreamin ' about ? Nothing . It was a nightmare . How did you know ? To come in here ? I was on the phone . I could hear you through the wall , calling out . - Who were you on the phone to ? - Dr Lisa Holland . That anger management group she runs , it 's getting smaller . I 'm gonna need to see some identification . - It 's OK , let ' em through . - Go ahead , - What happened to the lights ? - Somebody cut ' em . You might wanna watch your step . We got some blood on the ï¬‚oor . Not as much as you 'd expect . - Oh , my God ! - Hey , you OK ? Monica ? Agent Reyes . I got a call from Agent Doggett . He said there 's another victim , Monica ? You OK ? - I 'm just catching my breath . - I 've got something to show you . Case files from crimes back in 1960 . - What are they ? - More skinned bodies . Cut with the same precision as the body I examined . Can I see that light a second ? He 's still alive . Somebody get in here and get him down ! We need a medic in here ! Can you hear me ? Do you understand ? Who did this to you ? Do you know who did this to you ? - Are we goin ' somewhere , baby ? - You 're not . Get out . - Eddie ? - What did I just say ? ! - I 'm not even dressed . - What else is new ? Get out . Why are you such a jerk ? Get her outta here . FBI ! Stop right there ! What part of " Stop right there " did you not understand ? So what ? He 'sjust waiting for his lawyer ? He 's in a bad place . I 've been there myself , sitting right where he is now , not thinking you have a chance . You ever murder two men ? He 's four years out of prison , holding down a job , showing up to work sober . Why do it ? Kill a friend , then a co-worker ? You 're the one that said he was a hothead . Why run if you 're not guilty ? Bag packed to hit the road . Packed with knives , I don 't think we 're gonna find the murder weapon on him . - What makes you say that ? - I think he 's running from something else . Iwanna talk to him . Hi . My name is Monica . I know what you 're thinking . That I must be the good cop . No such thing . You didn 't do it , did you ? Your friend Victor ... he said he had bad dreams . Seeing things . I think you 're seeing them now . How would you know ? Maybe I see them , too . Can I talk to you for a second ? You wanna explain to me what you 're doing in there ? - I 'm trying to make a connection . - Hell of a way to do it . I can see this guy 's defence already . " Your Honour , lwas having bad dreams . Seeing things . " " Ask Agent Reyes . She 's seeing ' em , too . " Something you 're not telling me ? You two about finished ? With what ? The suspect . He 's not our man . - What are you talking about ? - Girlfriend vouched for him . Said they were getting hammered at the Bent Oak from six till closing . Bartender confirms it . I don 't believe this . I know where you live , partner . You 're always welcome at group . Agent Reyes . I need you to come to Quantico right away , Monica . Why ? I have something to show you . - Agent Scully ? - Agent Reyes . - What are these ? - I showed you files of men killed in 1960 . Skinned alive . I had two bodies exhumed , looking for crossover forensic details . - Are there any ? - Yes . There are cuts in the bone , on the tibias and on the shoulder girdles , that match the cutting patterns I found on Victor Potts - using the exact same knife , which left a signature pattern of grooves . Same knife , same killer . That 's what you 're saying ? Well , it 's even weirder than that . I ran bios and backgrounds from the victims from 1960 . - They were both ex-convicts ? - Mm-hm . But look at the date that they died . March 8 , 1960 . June 21,1960 . Birth dates ... of Victor Potts and Terry Pruit . Potts and Fruit were born on the exact same dates that the previous victims died . You knew that we 'd find something like this , didn 't you , Agent Reyes ? How ? - John Doggett . - Where are you ? Outside the suspects house , wondering where the surveillance is . - I need a birth date on him . - Who ? The suspect , Ed Kelso . It 's important . He may be in danger . And he may be gone . I 'll call ya . Yeah . This is John Doggett . I need to speak with Detective Van Allen . Yeah , I 'll hang on . Just get him . I 'm still holding . I said this house was supposed to be under 24-hourwatch . The patrolman wasn 't gone five minutes . You see that man in there ? You think it takes five minutes to do that to somebody ? ! I don 't know how long it takes , Agent Doggett . I only know you said watch him so he don 't run . Agent Doggett . I have something to tell you . This thing with the birthdays is weird , no doubt about it . Looks to me like we 're dealing with a real sick puppy . I don 't think so . Choosing your victims because of their birth dates - it 's the definition of a serial killer , We should get the boys from Behavioural Science out . No . That 's not what 's happening here . - It 's the only thing that makes sense . - To you . OK , what do you think it is ? He knew he was going to die . He had a premonition of his death . Just like the first victim did . So how do you figure that ? I 'm involved in this some way . I have some kind of memory of it . It 's all happened before , and now it 's happening again . You mean that it 's a copycat and you have some kind of recall . These men ... were born to die this way , the same way they died before . The same way they died before ? Not the men , but their souls . Their souls are murdered over and over again from one lifetime to the next , by someone who won 't let them rest . Now , how 's this happening , their souls coming back ? Reincarnation ? It doesn 't strike you that these men were all born on the dates of the previous victims ' deaths ? Yeah , it strikes me . It strikes me that the killer is clever . A rag is stuffed in his mouth . A dirty rag ... black with soot . Coal dust ... from a coal mine . How the hell did you know that ? I don 't know . - What are we looking for ? - I don 't know exactly . But if the old files are correct , there 's gonna be a fourth victim . Looks like Housekeeping hasn 't been here in a while . You or me ? I 'll check out the mine . You shouldn 't have come here . I 'm a federal agent . I 'm armed . Let go of the gun now . You can 't stop it . You never do . You always fail . It 's your lot . Agent Reyes ? Monica ? Agent Reyes ! Are you hurt ? Talk to me . - He was here . - Who ? Van Allen . He 's who 's killing these men . Van Allen ? He was skinned himself , back in 1868 , by four men in a mining dispute . His killers were never punished . Now he 's born to keep avenging that injustice . Again and again . - Van Allen 's the cop here . - That 's why these cases never get solved . Every time , four murders . Every time , four bodies . Then he takes his own life so he can just start it up all over again . There 's still a fourth victim and I think I know who it is . - Lisa Holland . - Dr Holland , it 's Monica Reyes . You 've seen the visions , like the others in your group . Visions of people skinned alive . It 's true , isn 't it ? How did you know ? - Where are you now ? - Just finishing a session . Is there anybody with you ? No , they 've all left . What 's this about ? Get out of there . You 're in danger . It 's Detective Van Allen , he 's coming after you . Dr Holland ? Dr Holland ? Time 's come ! You 're the last . No use running . It always ends the same . Get the paramedics out here . You ... always fail . You 're not dying on me . Not until you tell me what you mean ! Doc says it 's gonna be touch and go tonight , that we should go home . Go on , Monica . Go on home . There 's nothing you 're gonna learn here now . You still won 't believe it , will you ? My connection to this man . However you did it , however you knew what you know , what matters here is you saved a woman 's life . He 's trying . We all are . It 's just a long way to go from ... .. this ... .. to this . Do you believe in second chances , Dana ? A chance to correct the mistakes we make in our lives ? You mean in a future life ? That 's what these people were trying to do , all the victims ... trying to atone for their sins , from what happened in that photo . Only this man wouldn 't let them . And Lisa Holland ? What about her ? She was one of them . One of the men you see standing there . And you ? Whoever I was , I failed . In 1868 , in 1909 , in 1960 I failed . I was always there but I couldn 't stop the killings . And he knew that . Just like he knows I 'm here right now . He feels me , the way I felt him when I saw that picture of the first victim . And somehow he knows my deepest fear : that I 'll fail . Well , maybe in this life you succeed . Maybe . Ready , team ? Clear . 100 joules . Clear . 200 joules . Clear . 200 joules . Clear . I made this !

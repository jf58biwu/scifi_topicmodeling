 Anson ? Anson ? Where are you , Anson ? Anson . Come back , Anson . Anson . Calling Anson . Where are you , Anson ? Anson . Anson . Calling Anson . Where are you , Anson ? Anson . Where are you , Anson ? [ Tires Screech ] Anson , get out here ! I 've warned you about your attitude . You clean out 407 ? No , of course you haven 't cleaned out 407 . You 've only had all damn morning . You think you 're ever going to own any of those boats the way you 're going ? You think you 're ever going to amount to anything ? You can 't even finish a simple job . [ Chuckles ] A monkey could do this job , all right , Jay ? Well , you can 't . So what 's that say about you ? - Shut up . - Excuse me ? I didn 't catch that . You clean out 407 , you move out that deadbeat 's stuff , and you do it now . And when I come back in an hour , it better be done . [ Groans ] [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] Anson ! Anson ? - [ Sets Parking Brake ] - Son of a ... Anson . Anson ! Oh , that 's it , Anson . You hear me , Ans ... [ Grunts ] [ Muffled Whimpering ] Can I get you some coffee ? Water ? Anything ? [ Door Opens ] Good morning . - Good morning . - [ Mouthing Words ] Special Agent Dana Scully , this is , uh , Jay Gilmore . How ... Nice to meet you . Nice to meet ... Likewise . Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us from Missouri , the " Show Me " State . They told me you were the people to best understand my sit ... my sit ... It 's okay . Uh , this is Mr. Gilmore 's situation . This condition came on very suddenly about a month ago . Anson Stokes , he did this to me . I don 't know how . I just ... I know it was him . Anson Stokes is a former employee ... at the self-storage yard that Mr. Gilmore owns . Apparently there was some bad blood between you two . He told me to shut up ! Huh ? Yeah . And then Mr. Gilmore was , uh , stricken ... - stricken ... stricken . - Uh-huh . And Anson Stokes was nowhere to be found . He resurfaced several days later , and the police wanted to question him , but he refused . Do you know what he said ? He said they had nothing on him . Well , and to be fair , sir , they didn 't . They don 't . They had to make me a whole new mouth . Do you think Blue Cross is going to pay for this ? Uh-uh . I demand justice ! Ow . - Mulder , all I 'm saying is that ... - I know . This may not be a crime , and this guy Stokes may not know anything about it . Look , there is a condition called microstomia ... small mouth ... which is brought on by the disease scleroderma . It 's the overproduction of collagen . It can actually reduce a person 's mouth to a tiny little opening . But that takes months to develop , right ? It doesn 't just happen in the blink of an eye . Gilmore 's surgeons are stumped . They 're writing it up in the New England Journal of Medicine . There 's always nasal aplasia , the complete absence of the nose . That 's a nose , Scully . We 're talking mouth here . But what we 're talking is medical , physiological , not criminal . - Not as far as I can see . - Maybe , but I still want to know ... - why Anson Stokes doesn 't want to talk to the police . - Mulder . That 's a little ... out of place , wouldn 't you say ? A little bit . [ Anson ] Ah , damn it . - Leslie ! - What ? What is it ? I.R.S. Agents . Gotta be . Get rid of them , all right ? Hi . We 're looking for a Mr. Anson Stokes . He 's not here . Would you happen to know when he 's coming back ? Well , we are Agents Mulder and Scully from the F.B.I. The boat 's ... The boat 's not ours . [ Stammering ] We 're holding it for someone , and , you know , th-they pay the taxes on it . Okay . Anson 's not here . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What 's your name ? - Leslie Stokes . - Oh , you 're Anson 's brother ? [ Rattling ] Hi there . We 're not here to talk about the boat , Leslie . We want to talk to your brother about his former employer , Mr. Gilmore . And the , uh , unfortunate condition that he 's found himself in . - Would you happen to know anything about that ? - The mouth thing ? Well , yeah , you know , that 's just , uh ... That 's , like , chemicals . " Chemicals " ? Well , yeah , you know , like people store weird chemicals , like ... Like my brother , one time he smelled this weird smell . You know , it was just a guy with a meth lab , you know , like in one of the storage units . That 's probably something you guys should look into . I 'm gonna get going . So I 'm gonna go . Okay . Okay . Now I see what 's going on here . According to Gilmore , he was standing right where I am when it happened . Well , I don 't smell any weird chemical smells . You still have both your lips . Apparently everything is left as it was . Hey . 1978 . It 's been a long time since any of this stuff has seen the light of day . That 's too bad , Mulder . Underneath all this dust , this furniture is really wonderful . Oh , well , you want to hit some yard sales while we 're out here ? Mulder , this furniture is expensive . Very expensive . - What 's your point ? - My point is that ... there 's a lot of money sitting around here , and maybe something 's missing . - Like what ? - I don 't know . Jewelry . Anson Stokes opened up the storage unit , and then he just disappeared . - Winds up with the Titanic in his driveway . - Mm-hmm . There 's your crime ... theft . Still doesn 't explain what happened to Gilmore . Hey , Scully , check this out . - Ouch . - This woman look familiar to you ? - That 's the woman from the trailer . - It 's the young woman from the trailer . How many centuries now has disco been dead ? Two down . Two down , I got nothing to show for it . You got the boat . And what the hell good is that ? Huh ? That thing is like a big ... You know , a big ... - White elephant ? - What ? I 'm sorry . What does that mean ? It 's a big expensive item that serves no purpose and is more trouble than it 's worth . So what the hell did you give it to me for ? - Because you asked for it . - All right . I can appreciate that . But don 't you think maybe you could 've found some fricking water to put it in ? - You didn 't specify water . - I gotta specify that you put a boat in the water ? That is a given . Fricking white elephant . I can 't even pay the taxes on it . Why don 't you just use your last wish to get rid of it ? You want me to put you in a home or something maybe ? Because I just told you , Leslie , that I wasted two wishes , okay ? Are you listening ? I am not gonna waste the third , all right ? Come on . Come on ! I gotta concentrate here . Let me figure this out . Third wish , third wish . Final wish . I 'm just spitballing here . If I happen to say " I wish " by accident , that does not count . Not until I am absolutely ready , okay ? You could always give that guy his mouth back . All I said is that I wish Jay would shut the hell up . If you feel bad about what you did to him , fix it on your own dime , okay ? - It doesn 't work like that . - Whatever . - Leslie , would you help me out here ? - Um , money . - Yeah . Okay , that 's not bad . - Wish for money . But don 't you think we should think of something that would ... generate money instead of the actual money itself ? Brains ? Talent ? Hard work ? Uhhh , a money machine . Okay , that 's not ... But something better . Something better . Okay . But I just ... - An infinite number of wishes . - Okay ! Just three , boys . Settle down . Damn it , this is hard ! You know , I have a thought . - Granted it 's pretty obvious . - What , what , what , what , what ? - What ? - What ? - Seriously , what ? - Oh , forget it ! - I got it . I got it . - Yeah ? I got it , I got it , I got it . Okay , are you ready ? Because I am ready . I am absolutely ready . Okay , here it goes . I wish that I could turn invisible ... at will . - You 're kidding . - No , no , this is perfect . Yeah , I can have an advantage that nobody else on Earth can have . I can , um , you know , spy and learn secret information . Pick up stock tips . - Sneak into a women 's locker room ? - Not just that , okay ? I 'm talking about James Bond-type stuff , you know ? Your wish is breathtaking in its unoriginality . You don 't have to like it , all right ? You just have to do it , right ? Done . - My ... clothes are gonna turn invisible too , right ? - You didn 't specify clothes . Son of a ... Screw it ! Oh , God . Turn invisible , please . [ Whooping ] Yes . Oh , man , this is awesome . Hey , hey , hey , brother . Hey , Leslie , I 'm over here . I 'm over here . [ Laughs ] Can you see me ? [ Whooping , Laughing ] Whoa . Aah . Damn it . - Anson , are you all right ? - Yeah , yeah , I 'm fne . I can 't see my damn feet . [ Laughing ] Look out , world , here I come . [ Whooping , Laughing ] I 'm invisible . Invisible , baby . Whoo . - Whoo-hoo ! - Yes . You can 't see me , can you ? - L ... Whoo ! - [ Laughing ] Hey , uh ... [ Anson Whooping ] [ Laughing ] Get out of my way , birds . Oh . Well , hello , ladies . [ Laughs ] Here comes Anson . That 's right . Come on . Come on , come on , come on , come on . Change , change . All right . Here we go . Need a little roadside assistance , do you ? [ Laughs ] Not to worry . Here comes Anson . - [ Vehicle Approaching ] - [ Screams ] [ Squishing Sound ] [ Buzzing ] Whoa ! Can we go now ? [ Door Opens , Closes ] I think you missed a spot here . I can see straight through to his ass . This is Anson Stokes , huh ? It is . His dental records are a match . He was found about a half mile from his house . He was probably hit by a car or a truck or something . And he 's invisible . Yes , he is . Wow . You know , in the seven years we 've been working together , I have seen some amazing things , but this ... this takes the cake . It 's ... It 's gonna change the boundaries of science . It is amazing , but I don 't think it has anything to do with science . Remember Mr. Saturday Night Fever ? - Yeah . - I did a little background checking . His real name is Henry Flanken . He redefined the term " overnight success . " In 1977 , his net worth was 36,000 dollars . And in 1978 , it was 30 million dollars . Then there is the interesting way in which Mr. Flanken died . How 's that ? Chronic morbid tumescence . - You don 't mean what I think you mean ? - Schwing ! On April 4 , 1978 , he was admitted to Gateway Memorial Hospital ... with an extreme priapic condition . Apparently he was quite the specimen . They had to raise the door frame in order to wheel him into his hospital room . Well , what does any of that have to do with this ? Well , I think our mystery woman is the link , about whom I can find no information whatsoever . - I think she 's responsible for all of this . - But how ? L-I don 't know , but we need to talk to her . Uh , I think I should stay here with the body . I mean , I ... You know ... I don 't think it 's a good idea to leave him unguarded . This is truly amazing . Okay . [ Mulder ] I 'm very sorry for your loss . - Anson didn 't suffer , did he ? - No , I don 't think he suffered . But the part about him being invisible , that doesn 't , uh , catch you off guard just a little bit ? Uh ... Leslie , there was a woman here earlier . Where is she now ? She 's , uh ... She 's gone . Let me tell you where I 'm going with this . I think that woman is a Jinniyah . - Are you familiar with that term ? - No . It 's the feminine for " genie , " as in ... a demon or spirit from Middle Eastern folklore ? - # # [ Humming Theme From I Dream OfJeannie ] - # # [ Hums Along ] Yeah , except Barbara Eden never killed anybody . Now , in Arabic mythology , they speak of these beings that are composed of flame or air ... but take human form . They can perform certain tasks or grant certain wishes . They live in inanimate objects like a lamp or a ring . Is this beginning to sound familiar ? Leslie , I believe your brother found just such an object ... in the storage facility , didn 't he ? He took possession of theJinniyah , and he made some pretty outrageous requests , likeJay Gilmore 's mouth and that yacht out in the driveway . Wait , wait . You believe all that ? I do . And Leslie , for your own safety , so that what happened to your brother doesn 't happen to you , I think you should hand over that object to me right now . You 're doing the right thing . Scully , come check this out . Come on . He 's not going anywhere . Come on . Bye . I have a group of researchers flying in from Harvard Medical . I can 't wait to see their faces . - What 's this ? - It 's not what I hoped it would be , judging from the odor coming from inside . I think it 's where the Stokes brothers keep their weed . But that 's not what I wanted to show you . - Recognize him ? How about her ? - Benito Mussolini . Your mystery woman or someone who looks a lot like her . The computer says it is her . I ran her through Quantico 's facial recognition software ... and couldn 't come up with a match in the known-felon database . Then I took a flyer and checked with the image bank at the National Archives . - Voila . - Well , even if it is her , Mulder , what would she be doing with Mussolini ? Or Richard Nixon , for that matter . [ Cheering On TV ] I don 't know , except that they 're both men ... who got all the power they ever wished for and then lost it . See ? I told you it 'd look good in here . Nice rug . How do you breathe in that thing ? Can we just get this over with , please ? - Three wishes . Go . - Don 't rush me , all right ? I want to do this right . I 've gotta be smarter than Anson was . Damn it , Anson . Then can I once again offer you a suggestion ? Hmm . - What ? - This ! Your disability ? There was some tragedy involved here I assume . Well , yeah , it was pretty tragic , I guess . Me and Anson were playing mailbox baseball . God , I miss that . And Anson 's driving . I was leaning pretty far out the window there . Oh ... You mean this ! Yeah , you 're right . I could wish for a solid gold wheelchair . Man , that 'd be sweet . I see what you 're saying . But you know what ? There 's something I want more than that . You 're not gonna believe your eyes . I certainly didn 't . You ready ? Oh , he 's , uh ... He is invisible , after all . Um ... He 's in there . [ Insect Buzzing ] Okay . You know what ? He 's creeping me out . This isn 't what I asked for . He 's all weird and messed up . - He 's been hit by a truck . What did you expect ? - Yeah . I asked you to bring him back to normal . - You asked me to bring him back . - Okay , you know , this ... [ Sniffing ] Now he 's starting to smell bad ! This isn 't what I wanted ! He 's gotta at least be able to talk . You know what ? That 's my next wish . - Wish number two : I wish Anson could talk . - No , you don 't . Yes , I do , and that 's final ! I wish Anson could talk ! [ Scoffs ] Done . [ Screaming ] I should just shoot myself . Oh ! I was so happy . I was so excited . What was I thinking ? An invisible man ? You saw it . It was real . I don 't know what I saw , Mulder . I 'm ... [ Sighs ] I do know that having that kind of proof in my hands , it was just too good to be true . I don 't think that 's why the body disappeared . Why did the body disappear ? I think it was a result of a wish being granted . A wish ? Whose wish ? Who would want Anson Stokes back ? I mean , really , really back ? His brother , Leslie ? [ Screaming Continues ] [ Scream Fading ] [ Gasps ] Well , this is no good ! [ Shuddering ] What did you do to me ? You 're back from the dead , man ! What kind of gratitude is that ? What did you do to me ? I wasted two wishes on you , that 's what I did ! I can 't feel my heart . [ Shuddering Continues ] L ... I can 't feel my blood . [ Coughing ] I am yellow ! I 'm cold . I 'm cold . - You know what ? Screw this . - I 'm cold . - I 'm cold . - I wasted two wishes on you ... and a perfectly good bowl of cornflakes . There , I turned the heat up ! Are you happy now , huh ? Are you happy ? Is there anything else I can do for you there , buddy ? What do you say ? Maybe wipe your little yellow butt ? Thanks for nothing . You wanna make your third wish , champ ? I 'd like to get out of here before the blowflies hatch . Yeah , I tell you what . My last wish is gonna be for me , okay ? It 's gonna be for me . You hear that , Anson ? I wasted two wishes on you , and you don 't even give a damn about that . Okay . All right . Third wish . Let 's see . I could wish for , uh ... I could wish for money . Everybody wishes for money . Um ... There 's the invisibility thing . I guess that turned out pretty stupid , though , huh , Anson ? To be invisible ! That was real smart , huh ? Uh , X-ray eyes , maybe . No , that isn 't it . Like you said , solid gold wheelchair . - [ Gas Hissing ] - Uh ... [ Chuckles ] Wait , I got it . Legs ! [ Both Shouting ] [ Jinniyah Grunts ] Would you mind removing your eyewear , ma 'am ? [ Siren Wailing ] Do you have a name ? Not for a long time , now . How about if I call you Jenn ? That 's short forJinniyah . [ Door Opens ] The , uh , fire department just recovered two bodies . - Leslie Stokes and his brother Anson ? - Looks like it . And , uh , Anson Stokes is visible now , of course . But what I 'd really love an explanation for ... is how his corpse got from my locked morgue ... all the way across town to the Mark Twain Trailer Park . Ask him . He 's got it all figured out . I know what he 'd say . He 'd say that you 're some kind of a genie ... from a Thousand and One Nights or something like that ... - and that you grant people wishes . - There you have it . One thing I haven 't been able to fgure out is whether you 're a good genie or an evil one . Everybody you come in contact with seems to meet a bad end . That 's the conclusion you 've drawn ? That I 'm evil ? Well , possibly evil . Possibly cursed . A curse to others . The only thing you people are cursed with is stupidity . All of you . Everybody . Mankind . Everyone I have ever come into contact with without fail . Always asking for the wrong thing . - You mean making the wrong wishes ? - Yeah . It 's always , " Give me money . Give me big boobs . Give me a big hoo-hoo . Make me cool like the Fonz . " - Or whoever 's the big name now . - You 've been out of circulation a long time . So what ? In 500 years , people have not changed a bit . Five hundred years ? Granted they smell better now , generally speaking . But human greed still reigns ... shallowness , a propensity for self-destruction . You 're saying that you have been a firsthand witness ... to 500 years of human history ? I used to be human . I was born in 15th century France . And then one day an old Moor came to my village peddling rugs . - And I unrolled one that an ifrit had taken residence in . - An " ifrit " ? A very powerful class of genie . He offered me three wishes . For the frst , I asked for a stouthearted mule . For the second , uh , a magic sack that was always full of turnips . Did I mention this was 15th century France ? What was your third wish ? My third ... I pondered for a great while . I didn 't want to waste it . So finally , feeling very intelligent , I spoke up , and I said ... [ French ] " I wish for great power and long life . " And thus became a genie yourself . Gave me the mark of theJinn ... right there . It 's forever . Sort of like a prison tattoo . I should 've been more specific . So am I under arrest ? I can 't think of anything we have to hold you on . Not surprisingly , we don 't have any evidence of any of this , so , uh , I think she 's free to go . No , I 'm not . He unrolled me . I get three wishes . So , your partner left the airport rather quickly . I don 't think she likes me very much . Oh , well , I don 't think she knows what to make of you . - I don 't ... think I do either , really . - [ Cars Passing By ] Well , you could always give up your three wishes . I 'll disappear . No hard feelings . - I didn 't think so . So what 's your first wish ? - [ Horns Honking ] Well ... W-W ... [ Laughs ] What would your wish be if-if you were in my place ? I 'm not you . It doesn 't matter . No , but , you know , I just ... I 'd like to know . I 'd ... wish that I never heard the word " wish " before . I 'd wish that I could live my life moment by moment , enjoying it for what it is instead of ... instead of worrying about what it isn 't . I 'd sit down somewhere with a great cup of coffee , and I 'd watch the world go by . But then again , I 'm not you . So I doubt that 's your wish . [ Clears Throat ] You know , I think I 'm beginning to see the problem here . You say that most people make the wrong wishes , right ? Without fail . It 's like giving a chimpanzee a revolver . This is because they make their wishes solely for personal gain . - Could be . - So the trick would be ... to make a wish that 's totally altruistic , that 's for everyone . [ Sighs ] So , um , I wish for peace on Earth . Peace on Earth . That 's it ? What the hell 's wrong with that ? You can 't do it ? No . I can . - [ Cars Stop , Honking Ceases ] - It 's done . Oh , crap . I guess I should have seen this coming ! Scully . Scully ? Hello ? Hello ! Very good . Genie ! - Genie ! Whatever the hell your name is ! - Yes ? - What the hell is this ? - It 's what you asked for ... peace on Earth . [ Gasps ] Listen . You know damn well that 's not what I meant . - You didn 't specify . - This has nothing to do with specificity ! You don 't have to wipe out the entire population of the whole planet ... just to affect a little peace on Earth and goodwill towards men . Mmm , you didn 't say , " Goodwill towards men . " So you expect me to change the hearts of six billion people ? No religion in history 's been able to pull that off . Not Allah or Buddha or Christ . But you 'd like me to do that in your name ? So ... what , you can feel real good about yourself ? D-Did I say that ? L ... I didn 't say that . Mmm , how grotesquely egotistical of you . I bet you wish you hadn 't made your first wish . Yes , I do , since you butchered the intent of that wish so completely . And another thing . I think you 've got a really horrible attitude . I guess that comes from being rolled up in a rug for the last 500 years . But we 're not all that stupid . We 're not all chimpanzees with revolvers . I think there 's another possibility here , and that 's just that you 're a bitch ! Agent Mulder ? Sir . How did you get in here ? Uh ... " Whereas , I have one wish left ... and desire to use it most effectively for the good of all mankind ... " yadda , yadda , yadda ... " here on this plane of existence . " Hmm . What , are you a lawyer ? Well , I have to be with you . I 'm gonna get this last wish perfect . I 'm not gonna leave you any loopholes . I 'm not gonna let you interpret this as an edict to bring back the Third Reich ... or to make everyone 's eyes grow on stalks . Oh , geez . And I was so looking forward to that . [ Door Opens ] Skinner called me , Mulder . Is everything all right ? You don 't remember disappearing ... off the face of the earth for about an hour this morning ? No . Then I guess everything 's okay . [ Sighs ] Mul ... Could you give us a minute , please ? Sure . Like today ? Wh ... - Where the hell 'd she go ? - Boink ! No . It 's gotta ... It 's gotta be hypnotism or mesmerism or something . Scully , it is what it is . You examined an invisible body , remember ? - I thought I did . - Oh ! [ Scoffs ] Mulder , all right . Say ... Say that you 're right . Say this is what it is . Then what you 're doing is extraordinarily dangerous . You even said that yourself . No , no , the trick is to be specific , to make the wish perfect . That way everyone is gonna beneft . It 's gonna be a safer world , a happier world . There 's gonna be food for everyone , freedom for everyone , the end of tyranny of the powerful over the weak . - Am I leaving anything out ? - It sounds wonderful . - Then what 's the problem ? - Maybe it 's the whole point ... of our lives here , Mulder , to achieve that . I mean , maybe it 's a process ... that one man shouldn 't try and circumvent with a single wish . [ Typing ] [ Jenn ] You ready ? Yeah , I 'm ready . [ Mulder ] I can 't believe you don 't want butter on your popcorn . Ew . It 's un-American . - Caddyshack , Mulder ? - [ TV : Indistinct ] - It 's a classic American movie . - [ Tape Forwarding ] That 's what every guy says . It 's a guy movie . Okay , when you invite me over to your place , we can watch Steel Magnolias . [ Chuckling ] - So , um , what 's the occasion ? - [ Tape Forwarding ] I don 't know . It just ... felt like the thing to do . - Cheers . - Cheers . I don 't know if you noticed , but , um , I never made the world a happier place . Well , I 'm fairly happy . That 's something . [ Man On TV ] And now our feature presentation . So what was your final wish anyway ? # # [ TV ] # I 'm all right # Here you go . [ Child ] I made this .

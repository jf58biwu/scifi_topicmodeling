 It wouldn 't take much : A couple of crap tables , make a roulette wheel out of a lazy Susan , a couple of decks of cards . They gotta have cards . So a casino in thunder Mountain ? Hell , they got everything else . Somehow , I don 't see Marcus warming to it . Yeah , well , what does Marcus know ? The whole population of people down there are bored shitless . Why don 't you just open up a brothel while you 're at it ? Now you 're thinkin ' . Where 'd you say we 're goin ' again ? A town called Mayfair . Oh , right , it was on Simon 's list . It 's just the name of a town . I don 't see that as much of a clue , if you ask me . Well , Marcus says check it out . You got a problem , take it up with him . Kurdy 's casino . Is there something here I 'm missin ' ? I never said giddyap . Excuse me ? I rode one of these when I was about 4 . I never said giddyap . I was afraid if I did , the horse would just jump right up off its spring and take off running , and I 'd never see my mom and dad again . Well , somebody said it . We all rode that pony . You smell that ? Fuck me . This is some bad mojo , man . This is some kool-aid sippin ' , mass-suicide type shit . I don 't think it was suicide . Look at these people . Some of ' em have their wrists tied . It smells like almonds . I ain 't never heard of almonds killing nobody , man . No , not almonds ... But cyanide will . You think they were poisoned ? Poisoned , gassed . Looks like somebody took out the whole town . What does it say ? " Never let this happen again . " Dear dad , it 's been 15 years since the big death wiped out everyone over the age of innocence ... The end of your world , the beginning of mine . Maybe coming ' here wasn 't such a bad idea after all . Somethin' about this place I like already . Let me guess , the scenery ? Bingo , baby . I don 't know . There 's something kind of weird about it . I just can 't put my finger on what it is . Nicky ! Honey , it 's ok . Just try and lift up , baby . Just ... Isn 't she gonna help him up ? Mommy , help me . Help . Here , honey , grab hold , grab hold . Oh , this is fucked up . You can do it , baby . I know you can . Hey ! Let me give you a hand . No ! Stay back . Look , I understand tough love , woman , but ... You can 't touch him . Why , has he got something ? No , and I 'd like to keep it that way . What , I look like I got cooties ? Well , you pick him up . You 're his mother , aren 't you ? It 's all right , honey . Ow . Thattaboy . Go get your bike . Unless you have business here , I suggest you move on . My name is stenn . I 'm Jeremiah . This is kurdy . What 's up ? Ok . I guess we can forget about the welcome wagon . Don 't take offense . Those are the ways here . No one must touch . Why is that ? Those are the ways here . Isn 't that what they call a circular argument ? I got another name for it . Let me get this straight . Nobody around here is allowed to touch anybody ? Those are the ways here . Hey , was I talkin ' to you ? What about all these kids running around ? What 's that , immaculate conception ? Their parents are guardians , except for those who gave birth before the decree came down . And when was that ? 5 , almost 6 years . So those young ladies , for example ... Never been touched ? Never . Which means they 're ... As the driven snow . Well , ain 't that a kick in the head ? You got a problem if we stay a day or 2 ? You 'll have to go through decontamination . Decontamination ? Ow ! This shit burns , man ! The price of purity . Suck it up . Oh , ok , ok , ok , ok , I 'm done already . Oh , I 'm done ! Oh . Hand me a towel , will you ? Oh , Jesus . Oh ! I 'm 16 years old . You 're not my father . You have no right . I have every right . You 'd be dead if we hadn 't taken you in . Karin and I are in love . I 'm sure you think you are . Ok , look , if you don 't want us to live together here , we could bail right now . And what , hmm ? Risk contamination ? Real smart . Well , those guys who came into town today , they look healthy enough . The seeds of destruction often lie dormant . Oh , man , what is the big deal with 2 people moving in together ? At your age , it 's dangerous . Yeah , right . Hormones course through you . They can overcome your judgment . Yeah , like we couldn 't sneak off and do it anytime we goddamn wanted . What did you say ? Nothin ' . Stenn hears talk like that , and you will be in deep shit . Wow . You mean the shit actually gets deeper ? It 's so not happening . I could tell . He 's 10 years older than I am , and he thinks he owns me . Let me make you something to eat . Hey , mister . I 'm just wondering , are you guys hungry ? Yeah , this is pretty good . What do you call it ? Food . Catchy name . So where are you two from ? Someplace where touching isn 't a crime . You don 't seem the worse for it . Why would we ? What do you know about the town of Mayfair ? Town 5 Miles east . I have friends there , but it 's been awhile . Well , I hope for their sake they left . Why ? Everyone in Mayfair is dead . They were poisoned . My God . That 's nuts . Almonds , to be precise . Either of you have any idea who might do something like that ? All I know is , it 's the start of the forbidden zone . Now , who decides that ? Town elders . What is forbidden ? Touching . They touch there . Not anymore , they don 't . As if I need another reason to blow this place . I 've had it , I swear . Well , what 's stopping you ? I was only 3 when the death hit , and Angus found me wandering around , half-starved , and he was only a kid himself . You feel like you owe him . Kill that noise , man . You got these cats tellin' you how to live your life , what you can and can 't touch . I don 't care what he did for you , if I was you , I 'd tell him to bite it and swallow hard . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Guess you don 't . Neal ! What are they doing here ? They hadn 't eaten . I invited them . This is still my house . Nobody takes anything without my permission . Whoa , whoa , relax . We didn 't take anything . The kid offered to feed us . You never quit , do you ? It 's all right , Neal . He 's ... he 's right . We shouldn 't have imposed . Come on . Don 't come back . Thanks for the hospitality . So far we 've got nothing solid to connect these 2 towns . Whoever slaughtered those people in Mayfair didn 't show a lot of mercy . There 's not a lot of mercy in new hope , by the sound of it . These people have taken puritanism to a whole other level . Can you say " whacked " ? Keep pushing . Simon was there for a reason . Marcus , are you all right ? Touch of the flu , I think . Better save the battery . You should go to the infirmary . You still don 't trust them , do you ? Me ? I find trust something of a narcotic . In small doses , it 's relatively harmless , you just don 't wanna mainline it . Well , maybe that 's my problem . Marcus , you ok ? Where are they taking that man ? Can 't say . You can 't or you won 't ? Offenders get taken away . That 's all I know . So what was his offense ? Could have been any number of things . Yeah , like holding his wife 's hand ? Who are you to question what goes on here , huh ? Unless I 'm wrong , I 'm not the only one who thinks it 's a little crazy . Look , we 're all alive here . The big death hasn 't returned . " May this house be safe from tigers . " Sorry ? A holy man once put a blessing on a house in the city . He said , " may your house be safe from tigers . " A couple of years later , this guy 's neighbor hears it and laughs . He says , " you know what ? There are no tigers in this city . " The guy says , " yeah , of course . It must be working . " What do you know about what happened in the town of Mayfair ? I ... I shouldn 't even be talkin ' to you . I could tell you stories that 'd make your hair curly . My hair 's already curly . Well , I 'm sure I could straighten it . I 'm listening . When was the last time you let a man touch you ? I 'm not sure . Well , it couldn 't have been very memorable . How long since you 've touched a woman ? Too long . Much too long . Was it worth risking your life for ? Not having sex 'll do you in a lot faster than having it . Who told you that ? Abstinence , man , it 's the number 2 killer in the world . And what 's number one ? Believin ' liars . What is happening to me here ? Hey , Marcus ... Do not be afraid . I am here to ease your burden . I don 't understand . Wait ... What are you ? I 'm losin ' it here . God help me . I 've taken the liberty of providing copies of Dr. gerris ' findings regarding Marcus ' condition . He says that once the anti-inflammatories kick in , the fever should reduce , but what 's causing it is still an open question . Perhaps you can explain why a special session of the council had to be convened . For the simple reason that there 's no clear line of succession should the unthinkable happen . Sorry , Lee , but don 't you think you 're jumping the gun just a bit ? Better to discuss it now than in the heat of a crisis . Appreciate you guys helping us out . There 's nothing wrong with a little hard work . Isn 't that what you always say , kurdy ? Actually , it 's " no good deed goes unpunished . " You didn 't bring us out here today to work on the barn , did you , Vernon ? You asked me about those people in Mayfair , right ? Yeah . Can I have a word with you , Vernon ? Yeah , sure . Idle hands and all that , right , guys ? Yeah , whatever . Drink ? You 're new . Yeah . I 'm elayna . Hi , elayna . I 'm Jeremiah . No one around here will help me . Will you , Jeremiah ? All depends . What are we talking about here ? My mom ... Help me find my mom . Her name 's Naomi . They took her away around last harvest . Who took her ? The elders . Why ? I mean , what 'd she do ? I got sick . She held me , and somebody saw us . Do you have any idea where they might have taken her ? No , but she 's close . I can feel it . Mommy always fixes my clothes . Move along , child . There are thirsty people here . You 're my last chance , Jeremiah . 4-4 . Still split . It may be better not to press the issue , Lee . On the contrary . As long as Marcus is in the throes of an undiagnosed illness , we 're a ship without a rudder and on a collision course . And only you can steer us to safety , is that the idea ? I have Marcus ' trust . I would think that would be enough . And if control is turned over to you , what happens when Marcus recovers ? Obviously , he resumes his role . Assuming you 're willing to relinquish the reins of power . What are you worried about , Erin ? The only reason the Mountain has survived this long is because of Marcus' unswerving vision . What happens up top , what happens in the world outside these walls , could well hang in the balance . What 's the matter ? You think I 'll subvert Marcus ' agenda ? I don 't know , Lee . I don 't think any of us know , and until we do , I think we ought to err on the side of caution . You sure about this ? Aren 't you ? Come on . Ok . Wait . Are you ok ? Let me catch my breath . Are you scared ? You ? A little . Well , at least we 're out of that hellhole . Neal , what if they 're right ? They 're not , and even if they were , you heard what kurdy said . It 's our lives . Oh , God . See ? We 're still here . You wouldn 't listen . You just wouldn 't listen . Get up . Neal deveraux , karin Lewis , you are charged with violation of the decree enacted by the committee for moral sanctity . Marcus ... You 're not real . This can 't be real . Your sickness is a fear of the mind . You are afraid to leave them , as you were left . I know the loneliness . Every orphan knows it . The great night approaches , but do not be afraid . When your darkness comes , you will be forgiven . Wait . Don 't go . Don 't ... don 't ... don 't go . The little girl who brought me water , her mother . Her name is Naomi . You 've gotta know her . Yeah , I know her . What happened to her ? You think it 's just physical separation they enforce here , huh ? What do you mean ? You don 't know what it 's like , ok ? You 've been here for what , 2 days ? I know people are disappearing ... And people are dying , for what ? Some screwed-up paranoia a-about touching ? This isn 't about touching , Vernon . It 's about stripping away everything that makes you a human being . It 's about puttin the fear of God in you . They took Naomi , just like they took that man you saw yesterday , just like they took all the rest . What happened in Mayfair ? They rebelled . Against the rules about touching ? They made sex lawful again . Well , sure . Legalize sex , next thing you know , people start smiling . And for that they were murdered ? If not , it would 've spread . What ? What would 've spread , the disease ? The thirst for freedom . Who 's responsible ? I asked you a question ! Who killed those people ? Vernon , I think you better come with me . You son of a bitch . You know what they 're doing , don 't you ? Don 't you ? Tell me ! Are you crazy ? Do you know what they 're gonna do to you ? I don 't give a damn . Take him away . Get goin ' . No ! Get the girl ! Get her out of here ! Not the kind of accommodations you were expecting ? I 'll let you know after I 've seen the room service menu . You think you have resolve . You don 't know the meaning of resolve , but over time , you 'll learn . I have no doubt about that . The little girl 's mother ... Hey ! Which one ? Don 't you think you 've caused enough trouble ? Naomi . Naomi ? What ? How do you know my name ? Your daughter elayna told me . I don 't have a daughter . I talked to her . I saw her . Go to hell . They told her that you were dead , but she didn 't believe them . Yeah , I might as well be . Don 't give up on her . She didn 't give up on you . For all I know , you 're one of them . Well , I 'm not one of them . My name 's Jeremiah . What do you want from me ? I don 't want anything . It 's for elayna . You have no idea what it 's like ... Not being able to talk to her , to comfort her . It 's worse than anything they could do to me . That ... that 's why you 've got to help me get these bastards . It hurts too much to hope . Can 't you understand that ? Please , just leave me the hell alone . Her jacket was torn . She said that you always mend her clothes . I guess you won 't be there to mend ' em anymore . She 's not sick , is she ? Is she getting enough to eat ? She looks fine . She 's ... strong . I think I see where she gets it . Angus , please . You can 't do this . You say you 're my father , for God 's sake , help me . You broke the covenant . You 're no longer my son . Dad . Dad ! Look at me . You have been found guilty of violating the supreme decree . The sentence to be carried out by the committee for moral sanctity . May God have mercy on your soul . Any last words ? Well , I got a couple . Who the fuck do you think you are ? Get the hell out of here . Turn the boy loose first . This is not your concern . You have no standing here . You plan on harmin' a hair on that boy 's head , you gotta come through me . Have it your way . What , you got big sticks , so you don 't have to get all touchy-feely when you start whaling on somebody ? I don 't mind . It 's just that fighting 's a contact sport . We call it banging knuckles , smacking jaws . It 's all good . Flesh to flesh , belly to belly . You gotta love it , baby . Only my knife likes touching even more than I do . Sticks and stones may break my bones ... But I know they 're gonna break yours . Look out ! Where 's the child ? Find her ! How are you feeling ? How do I look ? Like hell . Well , that should answer your question . I brought you some soup . Oh , I don 't think I could keep it down . You need to get your strength . What for , when I 've got you here ? Come here , come here . What ? Just making sure that you 're real . Never mind . Let me ask you something , Marcus . How did a man who created all this manage to be such a lousy judge of character ? You 're talking about Lee . While you were burning up with fever , he came very close to taking over the Mountain . Would that have been so bad ? You know that it would be . This place , this movement , shouldn 't belong to any one person . Then certainly not Lee chen . You saw to that , I 'm sure . What makes you so sure ? Oh , I don 't know . I 'm a lousy judge of character , remember ? Thank you , Erin . You know , for a while there , when I was swimming in the deep end , and I realized this could be it , I was terrified . I don 't think I 've ever seen you scared . It occurred to me , I 'm only a few years younger than my father was when he died , when a million people a day were dying . When we were kids , death was about growing old . Now ... The scary thing is not the end . The scary thing is seeing it coming . Who was responsible for the bloodbath in Mayfair ? If you 've been in new hope more than 5 minutes , you 've met them . Stenn ? He 's the leader , yeah , but all the elders would have had to have agreed . It 's hard to imagine superstition would drive them to kill . It 's not about superstition . Then what the hell 's it about ? It 's an experiment . It 's crazy , I know , but that 's what new hope is , what Mayfair was ... An experiment to find out how the virus was transmitted . If it was airborne and came back , there 'd be no chance , but if it came by way of touch ... If they 're crazy enough to wipe out the entire town of Mayfair for condoning sex , why take prisoners ? W-why not just kill all these people ? We 're examined every day . They take blood . More data for the experiment . I guess we 're the contaminated group . When do they take the blood ? I see we 've got a new guest . Roll up your sleeve . Oh , you don 't want my blood , doc . Shut up . Squeeze your fist . You ever heard of flesh-eating bacteria ? It 's nasty shit . I thought they made it up , until they told me that it was swimming around in my bloodstream . Oh , speaking of which , I 've got this hole in the back of my left thigh , doesn 't want to seem to heal up . Think you could take a look at that for me when you get a chance ? I mean , I wouldn 't worry about it , with the gloves and all . Yeah ? Do something , asshole . Uh-uh . One move , I poke this needle in , and your bloodstream is just full of that shit . Now , doc , what do you say you have your friend over there unlock that lady and the rest of these people ? You get my point ? Do it . Do it ! Now . I 'm sorry to say one of our shining lights has fallen from grace . Angus ' son Neal has run away , and Vernon has been exiled along with the newcomers for his treasonous collaboration . The good news is we remain vigilant , we remain pure , and the holy decree continues to keep us strong . Elayna , baby ! Mommy ! I 'm here , sweetheart . Stop them . You heard the man . Can 't you see a crime is being committed ? A mother just hugged her little girl . If that isn 't a capital offense , I don 't know what is . You mock us , Naomi , but the decree is all we have . It 's what holds our community together . Really ? Because I thought it was fear . I thought it was ignorance . You think if you spread your lies with enough conviction , people will believe you ? Well , it 's worked for you , hasn 't it ? If you don 't believe me , ask your neighbors . The decree is just an excuse , so they have Guinea pigs for their medical experiment . They figured you were all so scared of the big death returning that you 'd believe about anything . I can see that they were right . It 's that kind of talk that encouraged my son to run away . Why don 't you tell them what really happened ? Arrest that man ! What 's going on ? Your son never had a chance to run away , 'cause you and your murdering buddies stoned him to death . No ! Oh , you murdered him ! Oh , oh , my God ! That 's a damn lie . There 's your killer . No , he 's not ! You threw rocks at him . You hurt him till he stopped moving . Is it true ? Citizens of new hope , I implore you , trust in the truth . Oh , I 'm with you there , stenn , but let 's just clarify what the truth really is . 48 hours ago , kurdy and I were in the town of Mayfair . Some of you may have friends there , maybe relatives . Well , I 'm sorry to tell you , but they 're all dead now . They were poisoned by stenn and his committee for moral sanctity . That 's enough ! Take these heretics away . Now ! They 're not heretics , stenn . They 're not sheep , either . These are people , people with hearts . They have heads . You know what ? They have hands . You know , we could all end this nightmare right now just by holding hands . The experiment would be ruined , wouldn 't it ? Who 'll take my hand ? Stop it . No , you ... you don 't know what you 're doing . You 're gonna die , all of you . Don 't you see that ? A touch is all it takes . This is insane . Stop . In the name of God , I command you . Stenn ... It 's over . Your stranglehold , the experiment , it 's done . And now you 're gonna pay for it . I just keep thinking about how angry you would have been , dad , to see knowledge turned upside down , to see science so perverted . These people believed in what they were told , until they figured out their only shot at salvation was believing in themselves .

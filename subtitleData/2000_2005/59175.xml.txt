 Everybody , I woke up and I said , " You go to hell . " I can 't do anything . I don 't have any power . I 'm nothing . I 'm nothing . Yo , Willie . You okay ? Very nice . Thanks . Morning to you too . Hey , come on ! Get back here , bitch ! Thor , you ever wish you had another hand ? See you , buddy . Hey , Quentin . Hey , Stephanie . How are you ? I 'm fine . Going to work ? Yeah . Paying the rent . Can you believe we pay to live here ? - Hi . There 's my boy . - Get back , Thor . I 'm sorry . Come here . The mighty Thor , god of thunder . Exactly . Right on . - See you , Thor . - Wait , I 'll walk you down . - Are you a doctor yet ? - Yeah . You see my Beamer out front ? I 'm a nursing student . I moved here to be close to the hospital . - You 're not from here ? - No , a little town . Didn 't exactly fit into their mold , so here I am . That 's too bad . No , it 's okay . Small town , small minds , right ? Anyway , I wanted to help people . They need more help here . Yeah , it 's rough here . Yeah . Did you see the front page ? That Midtown creep ? Yeah . All those cops , and they can 't catch this guy ? I swear , if I was in uniform I would not sleep until I smashed that insect . I 'm sorry . It 's not right , it makes me mad . I hate it when the bad guys win . You ever catch any bad guys at the Bio ... ? ChemCo ? No . I did catch a guy kicking the snack machine once . - Did you take the perp down ? - Yeah . No , I mean ... . - Oh , nurse . I got me a pain . - Kiss and make it all better . No need to disrespect . Tell me you 're not hooking up with this rent-a-pig . - He just guards her tight little ass . - You should guard your mouth . - Who 's protecting who here ? - You guys just back off . Or what ? You 'll pull out your gun ? Oh , fuck ! He don 't have a gun . - He 's got his little mace can . - I 'll call the cops . By the time they get here , I 'll be scraping Renty off my boots . - Renty , go guard a pile of crap . - Like the one you crawled out from ? - Clowns . - You didn 't have to do that . - Do what ? - Stick up for me . No , I wasn 't sticking up for you , l- - See you later . Get your ass over here . - Came in last night . - Oh , man ! This is just ... . I know , dude . It rocks ! But it 's 300 dead presidents . Damn ! That is a big problem . Hell , no . Because I 'm putting it on a layaway deal for you . - Pay me in installments . - Seriously ? You 're my number one Arachnid Avenger fan . This is so cool . This morning started out bad . Yeah , yeah . You can blow me later . Okay , so now , check this out . 1 .1 of the new graphic novel series . - I 've been waiting for this . - This kicks ass on anything ! It 's got his whole story . How he got injected in Desert Storm and got his powers . Oh , man . Look at this ! The way he just cleans house . God , I wish I could do some of that stuff . This issue is mint . Do not spooge on this one . - Don 't worry . - Forget it . I 'm giving this pig a double-bagger and a comic condom . Morning . - What 's up , Papa Nick ? - Hey . How 's tricks ? - Okay , I guess . - " Okay " ? " Okay " ? You 're 23 , your prostate 's the size of a pea , and you got two good legs . You ungrateful punk . The world should be great . It 's beautiful . - Want a bite of my sandwich ? - I 'm okay . - Bologna with Kalamata olive spread . - No , thanks . All right , then . Let 's make our rounds , kid . - So you ask her out this morning ? - Who ? Who ? Who ? The goddess of the hallway , Stephanie who . - No , I didn 't . - No ? No . You know , Nick , you can 't ... . There 's some girls that you can 't approach like that . You got a point . Too bad it 's on your head . She 's not mean . She 's nice . But she 's out of my league . She wouldn 't think twice about me . You 're a good security cop at an important lab . You 're good at your job . If she doesn 't like that , that 's her problem . You 're a good kid . I 'm damned proud of you . - So any action today ? - Oh , yeah . A tech is selling plutonium to Arabs in lab 5 . I got illicit meth in 7 . And in 9 , Dr. Carson 's taking the longest dump in history . Poor little bastards . Every day getting sliced and diced . For what ? Hey , hey , hey . There 's Hairy Larry . Hairy Larry . Nick , you kill me . That baby 's new . They must have installed that last night . I wonder what it 's for . Jesus , Mary and Joseph ! That has got to hurt . - What did they do that for ? - I don 't know . - Larry must have something special . - Yeah , makes him invincible . That 's why they pump the others with his mojo juice . Quentin . Hey , Quentin ! - What time is it ? - Almost 6 . We kept the place safe one more day . What is with you and these comics ? My kid used to read that crap , but he was 1 0 . I don 't know . I guess they 're like dreams . Colour dreams . There 's one guy in the whole world that has something different . And there comes this moment when someone needs exactly what he has and he saves them . He stops the killer and he 's a hero . When you read it , you can imagine you 're the guy . I mean , if you had something special . - Don 't you have dreams ? - Yeah . Not about guys dressed up like bugs . They 're about Stella Stevens . - Who ? - Before your time . They 're at it late in Lab 1 0 . Are you ready for one last round ? You mind finishing up ? I 'll meet you here . No problem , Nick . Attention all personnel . We are closing in five minutes . No . No ! Nick ! Turn around ! Turn around ! - Let the real cops handle this . - My partner 's in there . - Take no prisoners . Go ! - Wait ! No ! Nick ! No , no , no . Nick . Poor girl . I was too slow . I should have been here . I 'm sorry . - Your bullshit killed my partner ! - Your bullshit killed my partner . He wasn 't worth shit ! You piece-of-shit wannabe ! Officer Williams ! Go sit in your cruiser and cool down . I got 1 00 bodies here . Do I have to referee a playground fight ? Sure thing , Detective Grillo . Get the hell out of here ! Are you all right , kid ? I 'm Detective Inspector Jack Grillo . I got a lot of questions . Will you be all right with that ? Detective , I 'm the facility manager . You wanted to talk to me . - I 'd like your insights . - I don 't understand myself . We don 't have any cash here . We 're a research lab . What kind of research ? Weapons resistance research . Drug therapies with military ops . I can 't tell you anymore . Can you hang around ? I 'll have more questions . Of course . Halloran ! Nobody leaves here without you getting their names . How can you let this happen ? Clean out your locker . - Jeez , I hate spiders . - Don 't ! - Did you see that ? - It 's the guy who killed his partner . What did you say ? What do you expect , heroes for 5 bucks an hour ? Mojo juice makes them invincible . Yeah , makes them invincible . Mojo juice makes them invincible . Okay . Bye . See you later . See you tomorrow . Okay , bye ! Good night . Oh , my God ! Quentin . Quentin ? Hello ? Thor . Hi , sweetie . Where 's Quentin ? It 's Stephanie . I just wanted to see if you 're okay . Quentin ? Hello ? Are you here ? Quentin ! Are you okay ? I saw the newspaper . I just wanted to save Nick . I let them stop me . But all that 's gonna change . Oh , God ! Let me help you . Okay . Let me see . I think I have the flu , so you ... . You can relax . I got my flu shot . Okay . Here . Sorry . You want to sit down ? - I 'm sorry it isn 't very clean . - Don 't worry about it . With what you 've been through , the break-in and your friend ... . Nick , yeah . I 'm so sorry . - Are you sure you 're okay ? - I 'm fine . - We should get you to a hospital now . - No , no , no , I 'm fine . God , you 're burning up . Come here . I have to go . - No , it 's not what you think . - I 've seen a needle track before . It 's not that . I was at work . It was an accident , I swear . - I don 't even know what it was . - Okay . Okay , okay . God , that really looks like it hurts . - You don 't have to do this . - Shut up . We 're neighbours . You 'd do the same for me , right ? Yeah . Whatever you need , I could do it . Thanks . So , what did you mean before ? - When ? - When you said that 's gonna change . It 's just ... . I 'm so tired of being a nice guy . I just want to change into something ... . I don 't know , something else . I hate to break it to you , but some people actually like nice guys . You don 't have to be a gentleman 24-7 . I can walk myself to the door . You take care of him , okay ? Good boy . If you change your mind about the hospital , I 'm next door . And get some rest . Next time I 'll ask her out . Twelve hours . Thor , what are you doing ? Excuse me , officer , but that is disgusting . Tell me more . Soon as I get my handcuffs . - Another round here . - Make it snappy . - Where did you get that ? - What ? The ink , your arm . That 's a beaut . I got these years ago in the Army . I 'll never forget that night . You gotta be some bad-ass to wear that . - See that guy at that table ? - What about him ? Will he leave with that woman or by himself ? Let me do you a big favour . There are two reasons why you don 't want nothing to do with her . Reason one : Officer Asshole is the biggest dickhead on the force . If you fuck with him , I promise he 's gonna hard-core fuck with you . - What 's the other reason ? - Her husband . Detective Grillo . Poor bastard fell in love with a uniform junkie . Trixie back there loves the tough guys . But Grillo ? I guess he ain 't tough enough , you know ? He 's not ? I 'll tell you this . Cops sit around here and talk about how Grillo went soft on the shield . His partner got blasted away six months ago by some dust freak . Grillo headlight-froze . Panicked . Couldn 't shoot the perp . Understand ? He 's in need of some serious respect . And he just walked through the door . Uh-oh , Dad 's here . - Let 's go home . - Golly , I just got here . Sorry to interrupt the mourning of your partner . - At least I tried to save my partner . - Still , he 's at the morgue . They take guns from guys who can 't use them . Take them . Pop , where l come from if the juice is empty , you throw away the carton . Yeah , Jack . What are you gonna do about it ? - Let 's go . - Let me go ! You are so rude ! - You 're drunk . - I am not drunk ! Hey , Grillo ! You need help catching the Midtown Murderer , give me a call . Hello . What 's your name ? Bitch , turn over ! I swear I just ran out of gas and my car is right over there . Willie , it 's me . Don 't give me that line . You don 't have a car . Right , I 'm sorry . Could you give me a dollar ? I 'm saving up for a car . Here you go . Don 't drink it all in one place . - Did you feel that ? - What ? - Movement , like somebody shaking . - I didn 't feel anything . - Who are you ? - How dare you touch her , you insect ? She likes it . Take a look at this . Someone threw this guy so hard his neck snapped like a twig . Someone took care of the " Midtown " for you . - You 'll be okay . - Will she be all right ? - I 'm Detective Inspector Grillo . - Stephanie Lewis . You 've been through a lot . But I 'd like a description of the guy who saved you . Look that bastard hit me so hard I was barely conscious . Hold it . This is a crime scene . But I live here . - I.D. ? - Oh , yeah . - Here . - That must have hurt . What ? The tat . Yeah . Yeah , it hurt . All right , go ahead . I didn 't see anything . He must have been pretty big , to snap your assailant 's neck . I ... . Quentin . - You okay ? - Yeah . Detective Grillo , this is Quentin . He was here , that guy . That creep grabbed me in the hallway . Somebody saved me . He was a hero , and I don 't even know who he was . He was gonna kill me . You 're safe now , he 's gone . A couple more details . I 'll talk to you later , okay ? I had to kill him . You and me , we do what we have do to save lives . That 's me ! I 'm that guy ! I stopped the killer . I 'm a superhero , Thor ! I 'm a superhero . Come on . I 'm a superhero ! I 'm a superhero ! Oh , my God . Papa Nick , I finally got something special . You 're a superhero ! Baby , it 's me . The Midtown Murderer was killed tonight . By a civilian . A civilian hero . It should have been me . I know this case has been tough on us . The last six months have been tough . We can try to work it out . You can work out anything in life , can 't you ? Trix ? It 's all right . Everybody stop moving ! Perfect . Hi . You okay ? You look ... . - I 'm okay . - You look better . Are you packing ? No , I took the day off . I decided to sort through some stuff . I hear they have some space in the basement . Listen , I 'll come with you . I got a few things . - That 's it ? - I 'll get those . Here , I 'll take these . Listen , thank you so much for letting me cry on your shoulder . I 'm glad I was there to help . - You know , after the ... . - Hey , check it out . - Back off . - You guys moving in together now ? Hey , nursie , can I get your box ? Leave ! Get out of here ! - You all right ? - Yeah . - God , it 's grungy down here . - Nobody ever uses this place . I can see why . - So who are you ? - What ? That wasn 't you out there . Maybe it was . Maybe ... . I guess I 'm just mad about what happened to you . - I didn 't mean to upset you . - Oh , no ! No . It was great . It felt great . God , you were amazing . Thank you . You 're welcome . Absolutely . I thought I 'd be prepared for what happened to me . I tried to fight back . I guess sometimes you just aren 't strong enough . We all need someone else sometimes . - Stephanie ? - Yeah ? What if I told you- - Oh , God , I 'm so embarrassed ! I 've had these since I was a kid . I can 't believe you saw these . No , it 's fine . It 's great . - Dude , what happened to you ? - I 've been pretty busy . No . I mean , what the hell happened to you ? You got this whole new vibe . - Finally get laid ? - Better . - Did you get laid by Lara Croft ? - No . I have superhero powers . No , you don 't . All you got was a new credit card . You always have to pay up later . No , I 'm serious . Something very cool is happening to me . - Why doesn 't she play dead ? - Why ? Spiders like their prey alive . If you don 't move , they don 't attack . What superpowers do you have ? I don 't know . I 'm still trying to figure that out . It must not include unlimited charge power . You maxed out your credit limit . That 's okay , just bill me . You know I don 't bill . I 'm good for it . Okay ? Okay , now I need a moving target . Okay , boy , I 'm sorry . I 'll get you out . I 'm hungrier than I thought . Oh , God ! What 's the hurry ? Watch out ! You crazy ! No ! Come here ! I am not crazy ! - Get off of me ! - I could rob you . Hey . I could rape you . - Please , stop ! No ! - What the fuck ? You 're safe , go home . Why are you crying ? He was hurting you . He was not ! He was not ! He is my boyfriend , you psycho ! 91 1 ! Please send the police- - You don 't need the police . - What are you ? - I 'm your hero . Don 't touch me ! Don 't touch me ! Wait ! Stop ! Shut up ! Jesus Christ . Police ! What kind of weird , freaky shit are you into ? What is this shit ? Huh ? Hey , Thor . What are you doing here ? Where 's Quentin ? What 's going on ? " Dear Stephanie , please take care of Thor . I can 't right now . Quentin . " I want to tell you what 's happening . I want you to help me . - But I 'm too scared . - Quentin ? I don 't want you to be afraid of me . I don 't want to lose you . Looks like a mummy . Well , he looks like he was ... . How should I put it technically ? - Like something sucked the life out . - Christ . Yeah . I think blasphemy is probably appropriate here . Getting dry-sucked killed him . But before , he was thrown on these shelves with incredible force . Sound familiar ? Okay , doc , let 's see what else we can find . It looks like very big cobwebs . Anybody heard from Williams ? There 's blood on the step . Have it typed against Williams . - How is she ? - Fine , since we cut her free . She 's babbling about some guy with a claw . Get her medical attention , have her screened for drugs . I can 't believe it . I can 't believe it . Quentin , are you okay ? Open the door ! - Goddamn it , open the door ! - Stephanie . - Not now . - You sound terrible . Let me help you . You 're scaring me now , okay ? I 'll get Thor . You want to see Thor ? He really misses you . Wait ! I need to ask you something . Anything . Would you ever have ... . - Would you have gone out with me ? - You ? Of course I 'd go out with you . You never asked me . I wanted you to . - Quentin ? Ask me now . - I can 't . Why ? - It 's too late . - It 's not too late . It is . Go away , please . Please ! Go away . Oh , my God . I can make this work . I can control this . Oh , no . Hungry ! Still hungry ! Hungry ! Still hungry . Still hungry ! Shut up ! Still hungry ! Shut up ! Still hungry ! Hey , bitch ! - What did you say ? - I didn 't say nothing . I 'm here . Hey , Renty . Where you at ? Down here . Oh , yeah ? What are you doing ? Creaming with the cockroaches ? No . Your sister . - Motherfucker ! I 'm coming down . - Kick his ass . Where you at ? Lloyd , get down here and help me find him . No ! Get away from me , man- - No ! I saw the news . - Did they find him yet ? - The killer ? Not the killer . I don 't give a damn about the killer . I don 't care if he kills the whole fucking city . Nobody 's seen Officer Williams . Maybe he got himself lost , or he got himself dead . Either way , he 's out of your life . Oh , Jack . Oh , Jack . I used to love you so much . You were so strong . I need strength , Jack . I need him . I 'm sorry . - You 've done something to him . - What ? You liar , he 's not dead ! You jealous bastard , you know where he is ! You 're one piece of work . I know you know where he is ! - Can you help me with this ? - This is not a forensics laboratory . Dr. Callaway , you are the manager . - Why was Kemmer fired ? - It 's standard for breached security . That 's fair enough . - Tell me , what exactly do you do ? - That 's classified information . I know , top secret . The sign says BiochemCo . I assume you do genetics research ? Genetic engineering ? The engineering of genetic material ? If I get a warrant , all of your work becomes public . Okay . You ever see what a spider can do ? What it can survive ? Sure , I remember my biology . They regenerate limbs . They 're strong , fast , and have a constant hunger that makes them kill . Right . Any data on introducing spider material into a human organism ? - We never got that far . - That you know of . Quentin ? Quentin ! You are in there . This is bullshit . You have to talk to me . Go away . Please . Quentin ? Go away . Fine ! You got it . And I 'm keeping your dog . Somebody stop me . I 'll call the police . - Don 't move . - You got it . I told you I had superhero powers . What do I do with them ? I don 't know . What do you want ? - You need help . - I 'm beyond help , or I 'm gonna be . That 's why I 'm here . Here 's your money . You 've been a good friend to me . What 's wrong ? Hungry . - Dude , I got McNuggets- - - No ! Stay still ! Remember what you told me about spiders and prey ? I need to know one thing . I looked in all my comics . What would kill the Arachnid Avenger ? - His heart . - What ? His heart . What kind of fan are you ? Issue four , an early one , dude . His heart 's human . It breaks and doesn 't grow back . Don 't move until I 'm gone . Damn . I always knew this shit was real . - Ever feel like you just can 't move ? - Every day and every night . Like someone 's tied you up , and you can 't find the knot . After a while it makes sense to stop struggling . You know what I 'm struggling with ? I 'm trying to finish up here . Yeah , I got you , Walter . Me too . - Thanks , buddy . - Thank you , Grillo . - See you soon . - Yeah . Be careful out there . Mr. Kemmer . It 's Detective Inspector Grillo . I 'd like to talk to you . Mr. Kemmer ? Come on , don 't make this hard . It 's very important that I speak with you . Save us both a lot of trouble . Please open up . Wrong place . Wrong place , wrong time . - Inspector Grillo . - The blood outside the liquor store . - It 's Williams ' blood . - Thanks , Doc . - What about the other specimen ? - What about it ? It 's a spider web . I know , but I thought there might be another component there . - Like what ? - Deoxyribonucleic Acid . Human DNA ? Jack , listen to me . Be careful . They 're about to pull you off the case . Kemmer ? Kemmer , is that you ? I can help you . Just come out where l can see you . Williams ! Didn 't kill me ... - ... like the rest . - The rest ? Okay , I 'm going to get you down . - Too late . - No , it 's not too late . Kill me . - Jack ? - Trixie ? Keep me and my baby apart ? You 're wrong , Jack . No , baby ! Don 't come here ! I know you have him in there . Trixie ! Get away from her now ! Get away ! I 'm here . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay , baby . Trix , I 'm so sorry . Hello ? It 's okay , Thor . I 'm coming . Hold on . Come on . Damn it . Quentin ? Oh , my God . - Oh , my God ! - You 'd better go away . - I 'll get you down . - No . You don 't understand . He 's here . He 's here . - Save her . - What ? Save her ? Yes . I very much want to save her . Stop killer . - Want me to shoot you ? - Don 't shoot him ! I won 't do it . No , I won 't do that . - It 's not too late ! - I won 't . Stop ! Stay away from her ! Don 't make me do this ! - Stop ! - Don 't shoot him ! Thank you for saving me . I rarely say this , but that 's not for sale . This is the new , limited edition : Quentin Arachnid . He 's a friend of mine .

 ~ [ Woman Singing In Foreign Language ] [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] Nandi ! Nandi ! Get inside . Go . - We ain 't open for business . - Shut up , whore . And you , we don 't trade with at all , Rance Burgess . You 're no longer welcome in this establishment . You 've been told that . I 've been told a great many things . I 'm here for what 's mine . Ain 't nothin ' here belongs to you . You don 't get gone , we 'll be well within our rights to drop you . The only rights you got are the ones I give you . - Find the girl ! - She ain 't here . Girl left this moon more than a month ago . It was you chased her off . [ Girl Screaming ] Petaline ! It 's a good thing you haven 't left with my baby . - This baby ain 't yours . - So you keep saying . - [ Gasps ] - If this D.N.A. is a match ... with mine , know ... I will be back for my baby . - [ Whimpering ] - And if I have to ... I 'll cut it outta ya . [ Sobbing ] Oh , don 't worry . Shh . All right , now . It 'll all work out . He 'll do it too . He 'll do what he says . - No , he won 't . We won 't allow it . - How we gonna stop him , Nandi ? - We 'll get help , that 's how . - Help ? There 's not a soul on this moon go up against Rance Burgess . She 's right . Ain 't nobody strong enough . And even if there was , who 'd help us ? [ Cocks Gun ] - [ Inara ] Hi . - [ Yells ] - Sorry . Didn 't mean to startle . - You didn 't . I was just , uh- - Bwahh.- - that 's more like a- - It 's a warrior-like- - Strikes fear into the hearts of- - You know , not altogether wise , sneakin ' up on a fella when he 's handling his weapon . I 'm sure I 've heard that said . But perhaps the dining area ... - isn 't the place for this sort of thing . - What do you mean ? - It 's the only place with a table big enough . - Of course . In that case ... every well-bred petty crook knows that the small concealable weapons ... - always go to the far left of the place setting . - [ Uncocks Gun ] Got a distress call coming in . Some folks asking for help . Really ? Folks asking for help from us petty crooks . - Well- - - Maybe I should take that right away . Well , it 's for her . - Huh ? - The call 's for Inara . - I 'll take it in my shuttle . - All right . I 'll send it back there to you . This " distress " wouldn 't happen to be taking place in someone 's pants , would it ? - [ Cocks Gun ] - Bwahh . ~ Take my love , take my land ~ ~ Take me where I cannot stand ~ ~ I don 't care , I 'm still free ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Take me out to the black ~ ~ Tell them I ain 't coming back ~ ~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ There 's no place I can be ~ ~ Since I 've found serenity ~ ~ But you can 't take the sky from me ~ [ Nandi ] And I got word you were in the area . I 'm imposing , but I got no one else to ask . It sounds like something this crew can handle . I can 't guarantee they 'll handle it particularly well , but- - If they 've got guns and brains at all- - They 've got guns . Payment won 't be a problem . We just ain 't equipped for this . Nandi , it 's gonna be all right . The house will tell you not to come . I know they ordered you to shun me when I left . The house can- - [ Chinese ] I would have waved you long ago . It 's just- - It doesn 't matter . [ Chuckles ] Who 'd have thought we 'd both end up all the way out here ? - Who 'd have thought ? - Let me know what your people say ? - Of course . - I 'll wait to hear from you . - [ Speaking Chinese ] - And you . [ Monitor Beeps ] I suppose you heard most of that . Only because I was eavesdropping . - Your friend sounds like she 's in a peck of trouble . - She is . And there 's no authority on that moon she can go to . They 're totally alone . Some men might take advantage of that . One man . And she 's looking for someone to come along and explain things to him ? That 's essentially it , yes . A whole house full of Companions . How are they fixed for payment ? They 're not Companions . They 're whores . Thought you didn 't much care for that word . It applies . They 're not registered with the guild . They 're- - - Independent ? - Yes . If you agree to do this , you 'll be compensated . I 'll see to it . I 've put a little aside . You can keep your money . I won 't be needing no payment . Mal , thank you . I 'll contact Nandi at once . But you will be paid . I feel it 's important that we keep ours strictly a business arrangement . - I 'll speak with the crew . - Good . [ Zoe ] Those who have a mind are welcome to join . Those who 'd just as soon stay on the ship can do that too . Hmm , don 't much see the benefit in gettin ' involved ... in strangers ' troubles without a up-front price negotiated . These people need assistance . The benefit wouldn 't necessarily be for you . - That 's what I 'm saying . - No one 's gonna force you to go , Jayne . As has been stated , this job is strictly speculative . Good . Don 't know these folks . Don 't much care to . - They 're whores . - I 'm in . Wash , plot a course . - [ Jayne ] That 's the whorehouse ? - Yes . How come it looks like a frozen dinner pack ? [ Kaylee ] Solar sheeting . Cheap power . Hope the whores are prettier than the house . - Nandi , darling . - It 's so good to see you , mei-mei . - You look wonderful . - And you look exactly the same as the day I left . - How do you do that out here ? - Sheer force of will . - Nandi , this is Malcolm Reynolds . - I appreciate your coming . Well , any friend of Inara 's is a strictly businesslike relationship of mine . This is my first mate , Zoe . I 'll introduce you to the rest later . - They 're good folk . - Can I start getting sexed already ? - Well , that one 's kind of horrific . - [ Inara ] Can we talk business ? In here . The rest of you , there 's food and some liquor at the sideboard . Make yourselves at home . Look . They got boy whores . Isn 't that thoughtful ? I wonder if they service girl folk at all ? - Let 's not ask . - Isn 't there a pregnant woman I 'm to examine ? [ Wash ] You 'd really lie with someone being paid for it ? Well , it 's not like anyone else is lining ' up to ... - you know , examine me . - [ Jayne ] Whoo . My John Thomas is about to pop off and fly around the room , there 's so much tasty in here . Would be you 'd get your most poetical about your pecker . - You 'd be the doctor ? - Yes . This is Petaline . - Yes , sir . - She 's feeling a might weak right now . All right . Well , let 's get you lyin ' down . - Now that 's a plan . Ooh ! - Shepherd ? No , thank you . We were hoping we might have a prayer meeting . We ain 't had one in months , except what Emma here reads out on Sundays . The last shepherd to come by was springtime ... and he only read the one passage . And he took it out in trade off both of us . Everyone 's got somebody . Wash , tell me I 'm pretty . Were I unwed , I would take you in a manly fashion . - ' Cause I 'm pretty ? - ' Cause you 're pretty . I take it reason doesn 't enter into this ? Not with Rance Burgess . The man is a taker . - You think the kid is his ? - I think it 's Petaline 's . - But the blood test ? - Well , he did favor Petaline pretty exclusively . But she had others . Fifty-fifty , not that it matters . The man ain 't fit to raise a cactus plant . His barren prairie shrew can 't bear him an heir ... so he takes it into his head to pull it outta us . - That 's not gonna happen . - I see that 's the case . And you see the way we live here . Go into town , it 's the same . Some places come up rustic ' cause they ain 't got more than the basics . Rance Burgess has money enough to build a city , a real community . Keeps people living like this so he can play cowboy . Be the one with the best toys . Turn this moon into a gorram theme park . Someone stands up to him- - He means to burn me out . Yeah , sounds like a fun guy . I 'd like to meet him . - This won 't be solved with talk . - Well , I 'm gonna fight a man , it helps to size him up . Well , he 'll be at the theater tonight . That 's a certainty . And so will I. Inara , think you can stoop to bein ' on my arm ? Will you wash it first ? [ Speaking Chinese ] So , I told the boy , you take a clean woman 's virtue , you take the woman . And that 's for life . And the boy said his vows right then . - Took very little persuading on my part . - [ All Laughing ] [ Exaggerated Laughing ] Oh , it 's nice to know there 's some places left ... in the ' verse where old-fashioned values still mean a thing . - Isn 't that right , dear ? - Hmm . - I don 't think I know you . - Name 's Malcolm . Malcolm Reynolds . And might I just say , she is quite a beauty . Well , thank you . Ever had occasion to handle one of these , Mr. Reynolds ? Silk trigger , active return bolt laser . Well , it 's lighter than it looks . Thought it would have more heft to it . Oh , no , don 't let that fool you . Won 't find technology like that short of Alliance . And even their issues don 't yet have the auto-target adjust . I had that crafted special . Didn 't think weapons such as this were generally legal . For private owner , I mean . My husband makes a distinction between legality and morality , Mr. Reynolds . - I 've said that myself . - Bending one unjust law is a small thing ... when it comes to protecting one 's family . I think I understand you . And as you say , she is a beauty . She sure is . Of course , I was referring to the lady . Ma 'am . [ Beeping ] Yes . - Well ? - Well what ? You said you wanted to look him in the eye . You 've done that . - So , what 's the plan ? - The plan is we get back to Serenity ... and we get off this rock just as fast as we can . And there can be no mistake . Good . - Rance ? - The D.N.A. matches . The child is mine . We run . Math just don 't add up . Our weapons stores aren 't exactly overpowering at the moment ... and I don 't much like what we 'd be up against . Nothing worse than a monster who thinks he 's right with God . Might turn Burgess away once , but he 'll keep comin ' . He won 't stop till he gets what he thinks is his . - So we run . - I understand , Captain Reynolds . You have your people to think of , same as me . And this ain 't your fight . I don 't believe you do understand , Nandi . I said we run . We . My people , your people ... and whatever bits of precious you got in this house you can 't bear to part with . We load up Serenity , and we leave Burgess in the dust . Capt. Reynolds , it took me years to cut this piece of territory out of other men 's hands ... - to build this business up from nothing . - Nandi . It 's who I am , and it 's my home . I 'm not going anywhere . He 'll kill you . Kill every last one of them if it comes to that . - And he 'll sleep well that night . - Rance Burgess is just a man ... and I won 't let any man take what 's mine . I doubt you 'd do different in my position . Well , lady , I must say ... you 're my kind of stupid . Oh , hell , he ain 't expectin' much of a fight . Might be we catch him with his drawers low . He 'll probably ride in by daylight . But I figure three-point watch , say , four-hour shift ... just to be on the safe side . Three point , four hour ... should do it . - I 'm fair handy with a hammer , Captain . - That so , Shepherd ? Been following the footsteps of a carpenter for some time now . I think I can do something about our fortifications . Okay , then . We start shootin ' ... he 'll most like try to burn us out , save their sweat and bullets . - Nandi , what 's the water supply like here ? - Underground well . Pump that draws it up is antiquated , but it don 't break down . Kaylee , think you can swing an upgrade for their waterworks ? I 'll talk to Serenity , see what she 's got we might use . - Good . We might wanna scrounge up- - - It 's starting . - And that it is , but time is on the enemy 's side- - - Dr. Tan ? Oh , it 's starting . Okay , okay , it 's starting . All right , yeah . Everybody , relax . Be calm . Nobody panic . Everything 's gonna be okay . Be all right . - I got this one , Captain . - Thanks . Okay . Okay , then . - [ Claps Hands ] - Let 's get to work , people . [ Screaming ] The girls and I have been talking , Shepherd . We 've been discussing what we 'd like said over us if we should happen to fall . No . I only bury the dead , child . No one here 's gonna die . There 's people gonna die . And with people dyin ' , comes guts and screamin ' . That can bring on all sorts of screwed-up behavior if a person ain 't used to it . When the time comes , most important thing , keep your wits about you . Clear ? All right . Now , these are my favorites . You 're to keep them comin till there ain 't no more to be had . I shoot , I run out , you hand me the next biggest one and so on . - Is there an understanding here ? - Yes . All righty , then . Let 's get to work . All I 'm saying is that we 're living pretty deep in the rough and tumble ... and I don 't see that changing anytime soon . - Nor do I. - Well , I 'm not sure now is the best time ... to bring a tiny little helpless person into our lives . That excuse is getting a little worn , honey . It 's not an excuse , dear . It 's subjective assessment . I can 't help that it stays relevant . I don 't give a good go-around about relevant , Wash , or objective . And I ain 't so afraid of losing something that I ain 't gonna try to have it . You and I would make one beautiful baby . And I wanna meet that child one day . Period . - [ Gunshot ] - [ Jayne ] Nothin ' . Y 'all are pullin ' ... not squeezin' like I said . Next one don 't hit that board is givin 'up a special treat . Dong ma ? That man 's gonna use up all our credit before we 've earned it . Well , after you 've saved our lives , you can do some chores maybe . - I 'm a fair hand with a mop . - So your legend tells . Truth is , I expected a whole lot more of you to be taking payment in our trade . Well , we 're not a conglomeration . Got a preacher , a married fella , and the doctor- - Well , he 'd have to relax for 30 seconds to get his play . That 'd be more or less a miracle . These are fetching ' little pieces . Any of them work ? Oh , don 't got many rounds for the chaplain there , but the rest will be of use . This is my favorite . What 's its history ? Violence and crime , sad to say . What about you ? Similar . No , I mean when are you planning to avail yourself of some of our trade ? My girls is clean and kind-spirited . Well , I got the- - the job on my mind . After , I 'm sure I 'll trade . They 're a fine bunch . You ain 't looked at one of them as long or lovin ' as you looked at those pistols . You 're not sly , are you ? 'Cause I got my boys . Sly ? No . I lean toward womenfolk . Just ... one thing at a time . - Never liked complications . - Oh , I 'm certain of that . Somethin ' to be smilin ' at ? I trained as a Companion , remember ? I read people pretty well . Well , that 's nice for you . She 's a hell of a woman , ain 't she ? Inara . Yeah , she 's a cherry blossom . No denying ' . I expect you know her better than I do . Comin ' up together and all . Imagine I do . She ever tell you why she left Sihnon ? - Never asked . - Yes , you did . I don 't know my own self . I was gone long before . And I 'll tell you , it was a shock , her leaving . She was special . There 's 40 women in House Madrassa , and you 'd pick her out in a second . Could have been house priestess few years time . - Is that right ? - Had her eyes on it too . Very focused . She 's like you more than a little . And how exactly is that ? She hates complications . They do crop up though , don 't they ? Such is life . [ Exhales , Screams ] No ! You 're not completely dilated . This should be pretty quick , but don 't try to force it . - The contractions are still preliminary . - What 's he saying ? - It 's gonna be a little while , sweetie . - Oh , but it hurts ! This child wants to be born . I know it . Can you get the green vial from my bag ? We can dull the pain some . How many babies have you actually delivered ? As the primary ? This would be the first . - You ? - My first too . - Mine too . - [ Petaline Groaning ] - [ Groans ] - It 's gonna be a long night . - You 'll do great , Doctor . - [ Groaning ] Who do you think is in there ? It was the dulcimer . The dulcimer drove you out of Sihnon ? What , did you kill a dulcimer in a terrible passion ? Actually , yes . And now that dulcimer 's family is out to get even . - I get it . - [ Chuckles ] I was at practice . You never stop practicing . You know , not a true Companion . Some baroque piece and the instructor keeps saying ... " You 're playing it , not feeling it . " And the fifth time he said it , I took the damn thing and smashed it into kindling . - [ Laughs ] - And that 's when it occurred to me ... that a Companion 's life might just be a little too constricting . So , I trucked out to the border , learned to say " ain 't , " came to find work . Found this place . - It 's a nice place . - It was a dung heap ... run by a pig who had half the girls strung out on drops . There 's no guild out here . They let the men run the houses ... and they don 't ask for references . We didn 't get along . And where 's he at now ? Let 's just say he ain 't playing the dulcimer anymore , either . - [ Mal Chuckles ] - [ Glasses Clink ] Oh . You are a remarkable woman ... you don 't mind my saying . Well , as long as it 's you saying it and not my fine rice wine . Oh , it takes more than a few drinks to render my judgment blurry . What about you ? Am I gettin ' any prettier ? By the minute . I should check the barricades . Make sure everyone 's ready for- - Everyone 's asleep . Well , them as can ... night before a fight . - Can you ? - What ? Sleep . Um , Miss Nandi , I have a confession to make . Maybe I should get the shepherd . Well , I ain 't sinned yet . I 'd feel a little more than awkward if he were here when I did . You expect to accomplish something sinful then , do you ? If I 'm overstepping my bounds , you let me know . [ Speaking Chinese ] Malcolm , I 've been waiting for you to kiss me since I showed you my guns . You okay with this ? I 'm just waiting to see if I pass out . Long story . - I want you to bed me . - I guess I mean to . I ain 't her . Only people in this room are you and me . So , my child ... how long has it been since your last confession ? - Longer than I care to say . - You gonna remember where everything goes ? Let 's just say I plan to take it real slow . So , the whore 's got herself a champion , has she ? This great man got a name ? Reynolds . Malcolm Reynolds . Mm , yes . I 've met the man . How many has he got with him ? Just a few . And only two real fighters besides hisself . But they got the girls stirring 'for a battle . Oh . I certainly wasn 't expecting a battle . [ Chuckles ] Seems the Heart of Gold 's got itself a few mercenaries . - [ Men Laugh ] - Guess we best call the whole thing off . [ Chuckles ] Earned yourself quite a bag of silver , little kitten . But I got a few more chores in mind before you get it . I 'm ready . Now , Chari here ... she understands a whore 's place , don 't she ? But Nandi and those others , they spit on our town . They 've no respect for the sanctity of fatherhood ... or decency or family . They have my child held hostage to their decadent ways ... and that I will not abide . We will show them what power is . We will show them what their position in this town is ! - [ Men Agreeing ] - Let us all remember ... right here and now what a woman is to a man . [ Men Agreeing ] Get on your knees . [ Men Cheering , Whooping ] - Um- - - Well- - I-I just had to tell Nandi about ... um , about time to- - - Big fight today . - Mal , please . No , I- - No , I- - Well , I- - Uh , you know , I was up . I got I think insomnia . So you took to bed with Nandi . I 'm glad . - Glad ? - Yes . She 's a dear friend and probably in need of some comfort about now . - Well , uh- - - One of the virtues ... of not being puritanical about sex is not feeling embarrassed afterwards . You should look into it . Well , I just didn 't want you thinkin ' ... that I was taking advantage of your friend . She 's well worth taking advantage of . I sincerely hope you did . So , you 're okay . Well , yeah , why- - why wouldn 't you be ? I wouldn 't say I 'm entirely okay . I 'm a little appalled at her taste . [ Jayne Sighs ] [ Sobbing ] [ Mal On Radio ] Wash , you there yet ? All but . Nice day for a last stand , isn 't it ? Nope . Plan to make a healthy few stands after this one . Just hoping for some air support from your quarter , is all . Couple of low flyovers , engines tipped earthward at full blast . Should give our guests somethin ' other than killing ' you to think about . [ Mal On Radio ] What I like to hear . Out . Malcolm seem a little funny to you at breakfast this morning ? Come on , Kaylee . We all know I 'm the funny one . You ladies and gentlemen all locked and loaded ? - Locked and loaded . Got it . - Yes , sir . Good . Remember shoot the man , not the horse . A dead horse is cover . A live horse , great pile of panic . [ Jayne On Radio ] Oh , now , girl , that is just plain dirty . Jayne , you are aware your radio 's transmitting ' ? 'Cause I don 't feel particularly girlish or dirty at the moment . Oh . Ah , yeah , just up here waiting , Captain . Ready 100 % . [ Mal On Radio ] Better be . [ Screams ] You 're stronger than this thing , honey . I can feel it in your grip . Petaline , look at me . This is just a moment in time . - Step aside and let it happen . - Mm-hmm . - [ Groans ] - How is she , Doctor ? She 's at 10 centimeters . Not long now . [ Groaning ] Inara , I thought it was just him that- - Nandi , believe me , I 'll be fine . [ Petaline Groaning ] [ Petaline Groans ] [ Cocks Gun ] Mornin ' . How you doin ' ? A mite tense . I 'd like you on the balcony with me . You can see everyone there . - If anything goes- - - You didn 't give me the whole truth . - About what ? - About her feelings for you . - I really don 't know what- - - [ Jayne On Radio ] Mal , looks like we got imminent violence . Zoe , Jayne , you seein ' this ? [ Jayne On Radio ] Gotta be 30 men out there . [ Zoe On Radio ] Confirm that , plus a mounted gun on that hovercraft . [ Jayne On Radio ] What 's that you said about runnin ' for it ? Okay , folks , we got no shortage of ugly riding ' in on us ... but that don 't change the plan . Anybody here goes down , you drag ' em to the back and get back to shooting ' . Only way to help them is to finish this . [ Mal On Radio ] Wash , gonna be trading injuries in under two minutes . I 'd like my sky a little less empty . - Copy that , Mal . We- - We- - - [ Gunshots ] Open her up , Kozick ! - Cover ! - [ Gunfire ] Jayne , I do believe that 's our first hurdle . Think you might- - [ Yells ] - I think I might , Captain . - Fire ! [ Horse Whinnying ] [ Speaking Chinese ] Go ! [ Mal On Radio ] Wash , where the hell is my spaceship ? [ Horse Whinnies ] Ruttin ' lasers ? Book ! Zoe ! Second hurdle . - [ Groans ] - That 's it , Petaline . One more push . - [ Louder Groan ] - That 's the shoulders . - [ Groans ] - Good ! - [ Man ] Git . Git . - [ Man Groaning ] Jayne , I lost visual on Burgess . [ Jayne On Radio ] Same here . Take to right . - Whoo-hoo ! - Hey . Hey . Get ' im . Let 's go . Come on , let 's get ' im . - [ Laughs ] - [ Man ] God ! Try the other side ! - Come on . Open up . - Got you ! - You- - [ Chinese ] - Open this door ! Nobody 's going ... anywhere . - It 's- - - A boy . Healthy . Good morning , Petaline . How 's my boy ? [ Crying ] [ Petaline Screams ] No . Rance , most of your men are either dead , dying or run off . Oh , well , that don 't matter none . I got what I came here for . Ain 't leaving ' here with it . - This is my blood , woman . - No , this is your blood . Now , you hand that child over nice and slow ... or I 'll spill more than you can spare . [ Punch Lands ] Hyah ! [ Gun Beeping ] - You 're gonna pay for what you took . - She was just a whore . Petaline , you bring my baby out right now ! You hear me ? I wanna see my son . Rance , this is Jonah . - [ Jonah Fussing ] - Jonah , say hi to your daddy . Say good-bye to your daddy , Jonah . Go on . Go on home ! You go with them . [ Woman ] ~ Amazing grace ~ ~ How sweet the sound ~ ~ That saved ~ ~ A wretch ~ ~ Like me ~ ~ I once was lost ~ ~ But now am found ~ ~ Was blind ~ ~ But now I see ~ I think those girls will do all right . She taught them well . Yeah . I 'm- - [ Clears Throat ] I 'm glad you were with her , her last night . - I am . - Yeah , well , I ain 't . Hell , wish I never met her ... then I wouldn 't have failed her . That wasn 't the way of it . That 's a kindness . But nothing you say will convince me different . Well , I 'm still glad . So , you weren 't before ? Inara . I ain 't lookin for anything from you . I 'm just , uh ... just feelin ' kinda ... " truthsome " right now . And , uh ... life 's just too damn short for ifs and maybes . I learned something from Nandi . Not just from what happened but from her . The family she made ... the strength of her love for them , that 's what kept them together . When you live ... with that kind of strength ... you get tied to it . You can 't break away . And you never want to . There 's something- - There 's something I should have done a long while ago . And I 'm sorry , for both of us , that it took me this long . I 'm leaving . Grr ! Arrgh !

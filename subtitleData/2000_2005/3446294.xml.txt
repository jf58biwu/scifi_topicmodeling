 Jake Foley was an ordinary guy until a freak accident transformed him into the world 's first computer-enhanced man . Millions of microscopic computers interface with his biochemistry and make him stronger and faster , able to see and hear farther than normal men . They give him the power to control technology with his brain . Jake Foley - America 's secret weapon . He takes on missions no ordinary agent can perform . He is the ultimate human upgrade . Could you please identify yourself for the record ? Agent Jake Foley , the human subject with millions of tiny robots inside . Did you see the way he stood up to us This isn 't about our " field performance " , this is about you finding a scapegoat . - You 're out of line , son . - that 's a soldier . - You like him . - I hate and fear him , but a man like that bent to your will could accomplish anything . I don 't believe he 's bent to anyone 's will . You follow orders , just like everyone else . that 's the problem . One I intend to rectify . All right . So who had the chicken crisp ? That 's me . And Deputy Director Beckett ? What did you order ? Vegetable soup . Green salad . Brown rice . Now we know how she keeps her girlish figure . Oh ! Here 's my pepperoni pizza with anchovies and artichokes . The two A 's that make a meal worth having . Mmm . Dig in , guys . Mm-mmm . We 're clear . The " two A 's that make a meal worth having " ? I 'm not a spy , okay ? You guys are the spies . I thought this war was with our enemies out there , not our superiors in here . Well , get used to it . There are factions upstairs who don 't want to see us succeed . They 're threatened by things they can 't control , and they can 't control you . What ? Lou , Diane and I had a talk . What , you 're voting me off the island ? No , but we can have lives after this program . We can move on . You , on the other hand , are the program . If it shuts down , Jake ... What ? You going to put me in a cage five miles underneath the rocky mountains ? Oh , god . I have a contact , an identity specialist . He creates new lives for people and erases the old ones . He operates outside normal channels . Now , what he does is neither legal nor cheap . But he owes me . Big time . If you want it , there 's a way out of this war . Three hundred year-old rivalries have flared up again in Kembu , Africa . A radical paramilitary faction lead by General Iniko Baako has broken last year 's cease fire and is attempting to overthrow the parliamentary democracy established by King Namir , the patriarch of the royal family of Kembu . Namir issued this statement early this morning . Kembu is a country that is run by its people , and we will stand our ground before this tyrant Baako , as we always have . And our allies from around the world will stand with us . His allies are us and the French . Well , I guess when it comes to the bleeding , that means us . As long as the oil fields of Kembu produce , it does . What 's the king asking for ? Very little , but he 's worried about his son . The prince . There has been no comment yet from Prince Malik of Kembu who 's in attendance at a private university in the Washington , D.C. Area . The unrest in Kembu raises the potential for an assassination attempt on American soil . Mm-hmm . How credible are the threats ? Judging from General Baako 's bloody track record , I 'd say very . He doesn 't just kill his enemies , he kills their families . We 're talking about putting our own agents in the line of fire . I see . What 's Jake Foley up to ? Hello , Jake . Hey , uh , hello , Executive Director Warner . Please , call me Valerie . I just ran into Warner in the hall . She was pleasant . - Now I 'm really scared . - You should be . - She has an assignment for you . - Yeah ? What is it ? Protecting Prince Malik Namir of Kembu until the unrest in his country subsides . Bodyguarding a Prince . Doesn 't sound so bad . What 's the catch ? It 's dangerous . You could end up between the prince and a bullet . And it 's delicate . If the prince gets hurt , Warner blames us . You get hurt ... - Warner blames us . - You are a good candidate . You 're close to the Prince 's age and you are the ultimate human surveillance system . We 'd have a team of agents working with you . Kyle would head a group here , profiling visas , looking for potential sleeper cells working for General Baako . So you wouldn 't be alone out there . Still , have you given any thought to what we talked about ? It 's about all I 've been doing . And ? And ... I haven 't made a decision on that front yet . So , in the meantime , I guess I wouldn 't mind hanging out with this prince guy . You sure ? Yeah , so , uh , where am I going ? To live in a castle somewhere ? It 'd be kind of cool to see a moat . - Watch out ! - Ow . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . No need to put that in the reports . Hi . Sorry . Can you throw it here ? Sorry ! Hey , you guys know where I can find Malik ? - Upstairs on the right . - Thank you . Oh , your highness . I 'm Jake Foley . I was assigned to protect you . Uh , I 'm with the NSA . Jambo ? I don 't believes he speaks swahili . Actually , I grew up in Vermont . - There 's not a lot of call for it . - Sorry . - You 're Jake ? - Yeah . I 'm Malik . You bow to me , call me your highness , anything like that , you 're fired . This is Tracey . I know what you 're thinking . " Isn 't that a woman 's name ? " No , no , I wasn 't thinking that . Smart man . - It 's nice to meet you both . - Likewise . - So , you 're my bodyguard . - Yeah . Are they downsizing at the NSA ? Well , didn 't you hear ? Scrawny 's the new big . All right , ground rules . I don 't like guards cramping my style , and I can 't have some guy following me around campus because that 's not suave . So , you keep your distance , nobody gets hurt . Uh , I 'm afraid you might . I was assigned to protect you , so , I 'm sorry , but that 's what I 'm going to do . - Hold on . - It 's cool , it 's cool . Is that so ? Pretty much . You 're not hanging with me , man . - At least not in those clothes . - What 's wrong with these ? Nothing at all , if you 're going to a debate . Come on . Perfect . You want me to wear that ? The crown prince of Tajir didn 't think it was so bad . He wore it with pride . Or I tell the NSA you 're not cooperating . Can I borrow your cell ? All right . I 'll be waiting . Take your time . All right , I 'm coming out , but I look like some kind of muppet reject . Jake , Jake , I have the Prince on the northeast perimeter . Where are you ? - Yeah , I 'm on him . - Okay . Excuse me , Tracey . I 'll excuse you in five minutes , but until then , my word to Malik and two C-notes in my pocket is keeping me right here . Tracey , I 'm going to give you three seconds to move . Or what ? - Where is he ? - He 's going past the science building . How 'd you do that ? 'Cause I 'm good at my job . You are never to get into a vehicle unless I check it first . I 'm sorry . So , how much is my freedom going to cost me ? You can 't bribe me , Malik . Well , that 's disappointing . Yeah , well , like it or not , you 're stuck with me . Have it your way . - Seat belt . - What ? Whoa ... ! My last bodyguard , Bobby Dean - he took two to the head . - You ever seen brain ? - No . It 's nasty . It 's nothing personal , Jake , it 's really not . It 's just that bodyguards , they get hurt . Then you got to bring flowers to the hospital , the grave ... Aren 't you worried about getting a ticket ? Two words - diplomatic immunity . - Yeah , how about dying ? - That 'll come soon enough . In the meantime , I 'm going to enjoy every moment to the fullest . Would you watch out ? ! What ? It was yellow . General Baako 's army swept through the northern cities of Ujeme and Nyumba in war-torn Kembu today . King Namir responded by deploying troops to the country 's rich oil fields , and , according to unconfirmed reports , Baako now controls two of the country 's four electric plants . How does the news know that before we do ? - Well , they said it was unconfirmed . - Well , it 's confirmed now . Baako has two of the electric plants ? No . Three . The king told us two hours ago he controlled all four . - Well , he 's lying . - Well , he 's our ally . Why would he lie ? To appear stronger than he is , and Diane ... What , this doesn 't really concern me ? Well , you know what ? Jake does , and if you 're going to assign him to the field , I think I have a right to know what 's going on ... ma 'am . Well , that 's part of the problem , Diane . We don 't know what 's going on . We need better intel . We have people in the capital . Who do we have that 's close to the king ? Uh , Jake is . Well , he 's guarding the king 's only son . - Hello . - How 's it going with the Prince ? I 'd say on a scale of one to ten , it 's about a two . - Jake ... - No , it 's fine . What do you need ? I need you to find out what his father is telling him about the war . Kyle , this guy 's not exactly thrilled to have me around . You want me to spy on him ? We 're the National Security Agency . It 's kind of what we do . Look for any e-mails or other communications . If the king 's going to be honest with anyone , it 'll be with his son and heir . - Hey , hey , hey , hey . - Come on , come on , fellas . You 're all right , man , you 're all right . Hey , you . Hey . I was just , uh ... We need someone to fill in for Little Mike . Can you ball ? I 'm not exactly what the doctors call coordinated . Come on , Jake . I mean , it 's not like we going to pass you the ball anyway . Come on , man . - Give me the ball . - Come here . Basically , you stay out of my way . I 'll take care of business , all right ? Here we go ! I 'm ope ... ah . Sorry . It 's all right . Jake ! Sorry . I 'm open ! Hey ! Ow . Hold on a second , guys . - Sorry . - Come here , Jake . Come here , man . What did I say about getting in my way ? - I 'm doing my best . - Are you ? Cause we 're getting blown out right now . We 're just wondering if Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner are going to toss it in or keep playing . Come on , man Shut your mouth , kid . Sit this one out , Foley . I can take care of it myself . All right , all right . Our ball . Have you got a concussion , or something ? Hey , you know when I said I was doing my best ? I lied . Whoo ! All right , Jake , okay . All right . Game point ! Dish it off , Jake ! I 'm open ! I 'm open ! Ooh ! You just got schooled by Kevin Costner . That 's what I 'm talking about ! So , where 'd you learn to play like that , Foley ? Mean streets of Akron , Ohio . You ? The guarded royal compounds of Kembu . Where I watched Michael Jordan , game five at the forum , win the bulls their first NBA finals . Ah , you wanted to be like Mike . No , no , just wanted him to teach me how to play . Dad flew him out for a week . He showed me his crossover , fadeaway , you know . Yeah . Yeah , I , uh , owned a pair of Air Jordans once . We may have more in common than you think . You 're a good guy , Jake . I don 't say that often . My father raised me to trust no one . - What 's he like ? - He 's a good man . Good as you can be given his position . He 's done a lot of things he 's not proud of . But people have been plotting against my family for hundreds of years . There 's a legacy of bloodshed there . Between you and me , it 's not something I want to become a part of . Who says you have to ? It 's my destiny . Can 't change that . I 'm going to crash out . You know what , Jake ? I 'd visit you in the hospital . But flowers - that 's where I draw the line . All right , man , I 'll see you later . Jake . About the outfit . Crown Prince of Tajir never wore anything like this , did he ? No . But you can keep it . Or burn it , or whatever . Okay . You know where I 'll be . All members of the royal family must be eradicated to ensure our complete success . The prince is your primary target . Jake . Jake . Jake . Jake . Yeah , I 'm here . Jake , there 's a breach in dormitory security . Someone just entered through an emergency exit , and they 're headed your way . Hands in the air ! Uh ... sorry . Sorry . Now I 'm going to hand Malik some utensils . You 're not going to try and jump me , are you ? Well , if you try and assassinate him with that spoon , you leave me little choice . Tell me about yourself , Jake . Do you know karate ? Jujitsu ? Kung-fu ? Uh , a little judo . Sixth grade . So what exactly makes you qualified to protect the Prince ? I mean , no offense , but I could probably kick your ass . Anna , he 's cool . Leave him alone , babe . No , no . It 's okay . It 's a valid question . Um , all I can really say is that it 's mostly up here . Otherwise , it would kind of hard to kill a man with your bare hands . You killed a man with your bare hands ? I don 't know if that 's the truth or an ice cold bluff , - but I 'm feeling you , Foley . - Fo 'shizzle ? Okay . You don 't need to do that . Baby , I forgot to invite Ryan tonight . Hmm . Don 't worry . I 'll see him in class . - This party 's going to be off the hook . - For sure . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Party ? It 's Malik 's 21st birthday . Well , happy birthday , but I don 't think a party 's such a good idea right now . We 're having a party . I don 't care what your bodyguard says . Anna , he is looking out for me . If he doesn 't think it 's a good idea , then it 's his call . All right , but you stay by my side at all times . Deal . All right , baby . - We got to run . - All right . It 's nice to meet you . Mm-hmm . So Anna seems like a pretty nice girl . Once you get to know her . She 's really special . It 's going to be hard when I have to break up with her . What are you talking about ? Eventually , I have to go back and marry someone whose lineage is deemed worthy of a queen . You 're in an arranged marriage ? Yeah . My cousin Shawanda . She 's 14 years old . Weighs 350 pounds . Cute face , though . Okay . I 'm messing with you , man . I can marry anyone I want . As long as she 's another royal from Kembu . All right , so you 're choice ... - well , you don 't really have a choice . - Exactly . Hey . Good job with Malik 's PDA , but aside from his social activities calendar for the next six months , - there was nothing on it we could use . - I see . Jake , we 're getting a lot of pressure from above . Kembu 's our biggest oil supplier in the region . You 're going to have to dig deeper . I 'll see what I can do . Moving on to some familiar calculus , who can tell me how we show that p-zero-one and this inner product define inner product spaces ? Am I to believe that after a week of going over this , no one knows the answer ? - What are you doing ? - I so know this . And a brave warrior raises his hand in the distance . - Your name ? - Alan . Uh , Alan Hergott . Are you in my class ? I 'm , uh , auditing . Even more impressive . Proceed to dazzle us . Well , since we don 't have an intuitive picture of the p-zero-one vector , we just need to integrate the product of the two factors and evaluate from zero to one . That 'll give us a real number . Well , that would be an excellent answer if it wasn 't entirely wrong . Now , who would like to correct Mr. Hergott ? Atone for his failure . His mistake is in the interpretation of the inner product definition . We 're not interested in the value of the integral , but that it satisfies the four properties of the definition . We can apply the properties of the Riemann integral , beginning with the symmetry condition , and ... there you go . Similarly , three other conditions can be proven through the properties of the Riemann Integral . Good work , Malik . Now we can prove some results from the property spaces . Nice brick back there in front of class . Yeah , yeah . It 's not like I majored in computer science or anything . So , what do we got next ? Early 19th century Eastern European literature . Great . I was actually looking forward to coming back to college . Hey , babe . Find anything interesting , Agent Foley ? What are you talking about , Ann ? I just saw your bodyguard hand off something to a woman I can only assume was another NSA Agent . What was it ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . What was it ? Jake ? I can 't tell you . You ... you 're not protecting me . You 're spying on me . - I told you he was bad news . - Nothing personal , right ? You know , I was actually starting to trust you . I should have known better . Malik ... - Stay away from me , Foley . - You know I can 't do that . - You 're fired . - What ? You heard me . Get out of here . You can 't fire me ! He fired me . Anything from Jake ? King Namir sent the Prince an e-mail yesterday . And ? You tell me . " The flowers have all faded ... blow if you will , autumn wind . " I didn 't know the king was a poet . He 's not . These are the last words of Lord Usagi in Feudal Japan just before he was beheaded . I think the King is trying to send his son a message . That he 's going to lose the war . Or his life . If the king is this vulnerable , General Baako will make sure there 's no heir left to assume the throne . We 've just red-flagged three student visas . Possible Baako sleepers . Stream the pictures to Jake . Make sure he stays close to the prince . Come on , Trace . Let me in . Hey , the name 's Tracey , and you 're not on the list . Yes , I am on the list . I see my name . It 's right there . That 's right . It says , " Don 't let Jake Foley in . " Now , get out of here . - What 's up ? - How ya doing ? - All right . Peace . - Have fun . Why are you still here ? Look , I can call the NSA and shut this whole thing down . Go for it . Hello ! We 've got some hits . Potential sleepers . I 'm sending you their pictures now . Don 't lose sight of the prince . Well , that 's going to be kind of difficult ' cause he fired me . - He can 't fire you . - That 's what I said . Listen , Jake , you need to fix this . - If the brass finds out ... - Hey , it was your stupid idea to start spying on him in the first place . Just hold on . Let me look at these . Kyle , I saw this guy . He just went into the party . I 'm sending backup . Get to the prince ... now . Yeah . - Foley ! It 's not going to happen . - Sorry , Tracey . - For what ? - This ! Hey , hey , hey ! Excuse me , excuse me . Pardon me , excuse me ... sorry . Pardon me ... excuse me . Malik ! What 's up Daddy ? Baby ! You 're so good ! Yeah , so ... I 'm in the middle of something . Malik ! Aww ... Malik ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah . All right . I understand . All right . Thanks . And for the record ... you 're rehired . I can 't believe this . It 's okay , baby . Everything 's going to be all right . We just received intel from Kembu . - The war over ? - Yes . The king is dead . What is it ? Malik , your father 's dead . West perimeter . Got it covered . Copy that . Displace to rear parking lot . I say again , rear parking lot . - Stairwells ? - We 're green . - Now I want a man on every rooftop . - Yeah . King Namir 's assassination virtually assures that General Inako Baako will be Kembu 's new ruler . Now , the State Department has not issued an official response to the rebel coup , except to say that so far , the situation remains fluid . Can I get you anything ? I 'm fine . We got to go . - Kyle ... - It 's not open for discussion . Lou needs to see you , now . Don 't go . We want you here . I 'm sorry . Look , we 're leaving an army here , nothing 's going to happen , I promise . Sorry about your father , Malik . At which point I used the necessary force to enter the dormitory where I found the suspect armed and directly threatening Prince Malik . But you guys already know all this . Why 'd you bring me here ? Jake , your work was exemplary . But you 're not sending me back . Well , who 's protecting him ? The prince is going to have to make his own arrangements . We 've been ordered to pull our security detail . That 's straight from Director Warner . He 's as good as dead without us . He needs us . Tomorrow morning , the state department is going to announce the commencement of diplomatic talks with Baako 's new government . We 're changing sides . Just like that . Whatever happens , Jake , you went in there as ordered , you proved yourself , you proved our unit . It 's a small victory , but we have to take what we can get . We promised to protect the prince . Yes , we did . Agent Foley . I 'm glad to see you 're okay . I 'm glad you 're glad . Excellent work tonight . Prince Malik won 't be so lucky the next time . King Malik . If he can rule a country , he can procure his own bodyguards . You didn 't have to give the order to abandon him . Do you know something I don 't ? This agency 's job is to uphold the nation 's foreign policy . Protecting the enemy of our new ally contradicts that policy . And you 're fine with that ? I 'm an instrument of our country 's will . So is everyone in this building , including you . An instrument . Word of advice ? Leave your politics at home . - And my ethics ? - Not my call . I barely know you . Malik ! Malik ? There 's nothing more I can do . It 's over . Don 't worry , man . I 'm not going to jump . Even if I tried , you 'd probably save me . Listen , uh ... I have some bad news . The United States has changed its mind . Baako 's your man now . Hey ... just because we 're not offering you asylum doesn 't mean somebody else won 't . You see those lights over there ? That 's embassy row . Go over there any night of the week and somebody 's throwing a party . Only tonight , they all must be partying , because not a single one of them has returned my phone calls . The South African ambassador said he 'd call you in the morning . He 's going to be busy . He 'll be in a meeting . You don 't know that . Anna , I grew up watching this dance . I know when it 's over . Thank you , Jake . For what ? I didn 't do anything . You did all you could . It 's my destiny . People who run this place - Skerritt , Warner - they don 't even consider Malik a human being anymore . He 's a loose end . Yeah , well , that 's how they look at the world . Not going to change . You didn 't think it would , did you ? Yeah . Yeah , I guess I did . Go figure . I just , uh ... What ? I just think you need to make peace with it , because at the end of the day , there 's nothing you can do about it . I don 't know if I can do this anymore , Diane . Jake , if , uh ... if you decide that this life isn 't for you , and ... if I come here tomorrow and you 're not here ... I just ... I want you to know that I would understand . And I 'd really , really miss you . Are you sure you want to do this ? I just don 't see any other way around it . So , thanks for everything you taught me . Yeah , well ... I 'm sorry it wasn 't enough . Mr. Wenk . Oh , call me Earl . Everyone does . Actually , everyone that does ends up dead to the world . So how do we do this ? We don 't do anything . You give me your car , I.D. , credit cards , kiss them good-bye . Couple of days from now , one of your neighbors notices a horrible stench . Cops break down the door , find the decomposed remains of a man your height , weight , color in a tub of maggoty slime . Apparent suicide . I call that " the bowl of soup . " I could also blow you up in your car . That one I call " The Erik Estrada . " Also known as " The Ponch . " - Where do you get the body ? - The morgue . I only kill people on paper . Anyway , while I 'm out desecrating the dearly departed , you 're on a train to sunny Jalisco with a brand-new identity . The identity , is it bulletproof ? Kevlar . Let 's get this straight . This is a one-time deal . A favor for your buddy Kyle . After tonight , you 're dead to me . More importantly , you 're dead to the world . You don 't come back from this one . Lou ... hey , I thought that I would find Jake here ... maybe . You won 't . Jake . Hey . You 're late for your morning work-up . Director Beckett , Agent Duarte , something you need to see . In another tragedy for the royal family of Kembu , Prince Malik , last remaining heir to the throne , was killed in a car bombing early this morning . Also killed , an unnamed female companion . Now , the deaths come only hours after the state department announced it 's support of the regime change . Why don 't we take a walk ? We 're clear . I know what you did . You took The Prince and his girlfriend to see Mr. Wenk , didn 't you ? You do realize that was a one-time only deal ? You gave Malik your ticket to a new life . He needed it more . You have a good heart , Jake . I 'm not so sure about your timing . The guy who was after the prince gave her up . Her real name is Ayana Karanga . She 's a part of General Baako 's radical group . She was sent in a year ago to get close to the Prince . I sent her away with him . I know . And now she 's going to kill him . No , no , no , no , no . You and I cannot be seen together . Just tell us where Prince Malik is . Never heard of him . You know as well as I do , once they 're gone , they 're gone . Not this time . The girl he 's with is trying to kill him . - Not my problem . - Earl , listen to me very carefully . You 're not the only one who knows how to make people disappear . Fine . Fine . But I 'm never going to help you again , ever . Where are they ? ! What 's the matter ? Nothing . It 's great , right ? We 're finally out . This is what you always wanted , Malik . So why do I feel like a coward ? You 're not a coward . I take it we 're not calling in for backup ? We 're going to have to handle this ourselves . I love you . I love you , too , babe . They told me to get close to you , but I got too close . - What ? - I 'm sorry . Anna , stop ! Stop ! Don 't do this ! Anna , stop ! Lay down ! Hey ! Don 't move ! - Are you okay ? - Let her go ! Let her go ! Let her go ! She 's trying to kill herself ! She couldn 't kill me , so she tried to kill herself . Let her go . It 's all right . It 's not all right . It 's never going to be all right ! It 's been going on for three hundred years ! Shh . - We can escape . - We can 't escape it . Jake ! Are you all right ? It 's okay . Come here . She 's right . You can 't escape it . But you might be able to change it . In world news , Prince Malik of Kembu , believed dead in a car bombing earlier this week has re-surfaced in his homeland . Seen here in a videotape broadcast throughout Africa , the prince has married a former Baako loyalist , and has now marshaled a coalition army to retake his country . You wanted to see me , ma 'am ? Yes . Did you know about this , Agent Foley ? Yes , I did . I heard about it on the radio . It 's an amazing story , isn 't it ? Unbelievable . That man may just have what it takes to reclaim his throne . I don 't doubt it . The real question is who are we going to back ? The winner , of course . Good night , Jake .

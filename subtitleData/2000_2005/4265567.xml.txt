 Season 5 - Episode 11 The Farnsworth Parabox joke0 Oh lordy lou , Heeelp ! I know you 've rejected me a lot before , but frankly , I wasn 't sure we were right for each other either ! But now I am ! So , how about a date tonight ? Sorry , I think I ... I think I left my toaster on . Budda , Zeus , God , one of you guys , do something ! Come on Leela , what 's the real reason you won 't go out with me ? Help , satan , you owe me ! Look , um , I 'm embarrassed to admit this , but you 've forced me to . I can 't go out tonight because ... I have sweaty boot rash ! No sp 'luh ! Why do you think I 'm sitting over here , in the stink-free zone ? So , will you go out with me ? Good news everyone ! I 'm still technically alive ! Yes . But I need you all to dispose of this crazy ass experiment that almost killed me . You 'll have to throw it into the sun itself , for only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction ! - I can hit it with a shovel . - That 's not good enough . This one time , I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel . Yes , yes . So , what 's in the box , already ? No peeking ! I don 't know what 's in there , but I 'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it ! You hurt my collater ! I don 't care . Listen well . No matter what happens , no matter how great your curiosity , you are forbidden to look in this box . Forbidden ! Pretty tantalising though ? Whatever 's in there , it 's the only thing I 've ever wanted . In my experience , boxes are usually empty . Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top . And one time , pepperoni ! What a day that was ! Give me the box ! Scram you lousy green snakes ! Here Leela , take this and use it to shoot those guys . Right , if they try to look in the box . Whatever . Let 's just forget about the box . The Professor said to stay away . Fry , how can you be so naive ? He was joking , get it ? - No ... - That 's what makes it so funny ! Ok , he wasn 't joking . Now shut up , and follow me . It 's hot ! The butter in my pocket is melting ! We thank you , Bender , for the gift we are about to receive . Tangled up Christmas lights ! We can take shifts untangling them ! And unlabelled booze ! Widemouth too ! That oughta keep those dopes occupied . I can guard the real box in peace , now that no one 's curious about it . Well , I got through the night , and no-one looked in the box . Not even me , the person who gave up her whole evening ... to watch it . A whole evening of TV ... gone ! What a mockery of justice that I can 't take even a little tiny peek . I need coffee . Ok . Heads I look , tails I don 't . Oh yeah , oh yeah ! Heads ! I mean , alright then ! No . I have a duty not to look . Well , then again , I promised the coin I would ... Ooh , it 's deep ... deeper than a small box should be . My lawyer will hear about this . Leela , what have you done ? Nothing ! Why do you mean " why was I looking in the box ? " I mean your hair . It 's all different-y . Bender ? Is ... is that you ? You know it . Large and in charge . There 's a woman for you , always dying her hair instead of not looking in the box . I didn 't dye my hair . This is how I always look . No . That 's how you always look . This throws my entire perception of reality into question . Clone , robot or long lost twin ? Taking all bets ! I also offer video poker . It 's some guy wearing a Leela costume . Get him ! Hold it ! You have this all wrong . I just fall into the box and then I felt out somehow . You shut up , sir ! No , wait ! I 've got it ! I know what 's in the box . Oh , I 've been as dumb as Fry ! I 'm not . It contains ... a parallel universe ! And when you create a parallel universe , it 's almost always populated by evil twins ! No look , I am not evil . My loan officer said so . You 'd like us to believe that , wouldn 't you Leela ? Or should I say , Eveela . Aw , this is awful . Somewhere there 's a more evil Bender than me . I do my best , dammit ! Leela ... The good Leela . I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are . Here . I tell you they 're not evil . But don 't be confused , they are jerks . Hello ! Come out of your universe with you 're hands up ! It 's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was in that drug trip . Astonishing ! I must have created a parallel universe ! Baldercrap ! I created your universe . All you created was my fist parallel to your face . Look , it doesn 't matter who created what . The important thing is ... We 're exactly the same . I know all her moves . Therefore , I 've got the upper hand . No , no . Perfectly symmetrical violence never solve anything . Let 's recap what 's happened so far . As you can see , I accidently created a box containing your universe ... While I , in a simultaneous blunder created a box containing your universe . This getting confuse . Why don 't we call our universe , " Universe A " and this universe " Universe B " ? Hey ! Why can 't we be " Universe A " ? We called it first . Besides , this place kinda fells like a B , you know ... Alright ! You can be crummy " Universe A " , and we 'll be " Universe 1 " . Or " The Mongooses " . That 's a cool team name : " The Fighting Mongooses " . Wait a second . If everyone is identical , why our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn 't ? Well , to be honest , I tossed a coin . It came up tails , so I don 't look . That 's weird ! Mine came up heads . So I did . Interesting ! Apparently , the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes . That 'd explain fruity here . I tossed a coin to pick my finish . Fog-hat grey . Bite my glorious golden ass ! You people and your slight differences disgust me . I 'm going home . Where is that blue box with our universe in it ? You would like to go back to your evil universe , wouldn 't you ? And destroy your box with our universe inside it . Nonsense ! I would never do such a thing ! Unless you would already have been going to do that ! - Wha ? - You heard me ! In any case , I 've hidden the box , and it will remain hidden until I 'm conviced you 're not evil . Everyone , keep an eye on your evil counterpart . And you all do the same . Euh ... Can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together ? We have plans tonight . You guys are dating ? No , no . We 're married . I got my eye on you , boy ! Don 't even think about it lunch pail ! You 'd be dead before you hit the ground ! Good point . What do you say we just hit a strip joint ? I was waiting for one of us to say that . Bender A , you 're a prince among robots . Can you forgive me for distrusting you ? I can 't stay mad at what is essentially me . I love me ! This is so great ! I always wanted an imaginary friend . I 'm not imaginary , I 'm parallel . We 're exactly the same , right down to the ... Beurk ! Is that pink nailpolish ? Is that not-pink nailpolish ? The Professor was right . You are evil . And shollow . I am not evil ! So Fry , Leela , how 'd you two get together ? Funny story . I ask Leela out a million times , but she just kept rejecting me . I 'd make up stuff like : " I have sweaty boot rash " , or , " I have to meet the President " ! Oh man , you never heard such excuses ! But , like a dope , I believed her . Looking back on it now , it 's kind of funny ! It sure is ! Right Leela ? Funny ? Then one night , when Fry asked me out , the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts , I knew he wouldn 't buy it . So I did what I always do in those situations . Oh Lord ! I flipped a coin . It came up heads and we went out . You mean you flipped a coin too ? And it was tails ? So that 's why you said you haven 't meet that ghost . You really missed out on something Leela . That day was magical . One year later , I gave Leela a diamond scrunchy , and we were married . One year later , I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a man named Scrunchy ! Well , that was pointless . Say I , hope you won 't think it 's evil of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound ? This old thing ? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain ! Of course ! I had the same idea . I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed . But it came up tails , so I didn 't . How 'd it go ? Well , getting the brain out was the easy part . The hard part was getting the brain out ! You ! So , tell me about yourself . Well , don 't looking to it , but I 'm a respected internal medecine doctor . A can ! As for me , I design mansions then live in them . I 'm lying , I 'm an appalling failure . Me too , a big fat one . And those co-workers . Always looking down on us Zoidbergs . What are they ? From Nob hill ? They 're all like , " Stop spraying me with ink , Zoidberg . " " Put on pants , Zoidberg ! " " Don 't touch our fancy box , Zoidberg . " Ohhh , that box . Too good for us , is it ? Bah ! Someday they 'll watch from down in the gutter , they will , as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box . You know ... maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box . Good news everyones ! After carefully reading the Scriptures , we 've conclued that none of us are evil ! Yes , the Bible is the real good news . Anyhow , you 're all free to go back to your home universe . What 's going on here ? Why aren 't you all out to destroying the Professor 's box ? Hermes , aren 't you curious about the fact that there 's two of everybody ? No . Now like my granny used to say back in her tall paper shack on Montego Bay : " If you want a box hurled into the sun , you gotta do it yourself ! " Your granny can go to hell ! I 've hidden the box , so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here . Oh go on ! Hey , wait a second ! If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe , then your Hermes ... Oh my ... " And sure enough ! " Like granny said : " If you want a box hurled into the sun , you gotta do it yourself . " God rest her zombie bones . So , we go back through the box and stop Hermes . Right . Good thing , Professor B , there , hid it in the sealer-camf tank . No one but a crazy lobster would look there ! It 's gone ! All hail Zoidberg ! The king with the box ! Now it 's my turn maybe ? The box says no . Meanwhile in universe A , Hermes A heads towards the sun ...... A Item 1 : Box . Check . Item 2 : Sun . It 's a big check . If I know parallel Hermes , he 's at the sun by now ! Our universe is doomed ! Dooooooooooommmed ! No , don 't give up yet you cry-babies . The box is gone , but we still have one preposterously slim hope . Is it a kind of hairspray ? No ! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe . Well , is that your universe in there ? Nope , too cold . Oh women . I 'll put this one aside for later . Oh man , it 's hopeless , we 'll never find your universe in time ! Plus , this box is stuck on my fat head ! Yes , it 's the apocalypse alright . I always thought I 'd have an hand in it ! I 'm not sad , because I finaly found someone as great as me . It 's like I always say : " Make new friend but kill the old . One is silver ... the other is gold . " Why with the long faces ? The idiots have the box ! I think she means you . Grab them ! You coward ! Wait for me ! Which one did they go into ? No , let 's all ask each other ! That will solve this problem . We each have to search a universe . Everyone , grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back . Hello ! Did you see two smelly lobsters ? We didn 't see any 'ting . Ever . Yo ! Did two shellfishs in scrubs go by ? - Hell no ! - Shut up ! Beat it jerk ! Have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here ? Negative ! Will you ... go out ... with me ? Access denied . Hey pal , look what I snagged from the Leprechaun universe . Yeah , Leprechauns universe is fine ... if you haven 't seen Pirate universe . Faith and begota ! Quae ? Quick ! Into an other box ! They aren 't in this universe they aren 't . Hey , you ! What with the no boxes ? Baby , they 're somewhere . Everything 's like somewhere . Place is kinda " au naturel " right now . There they are ! Gotcha ! Dig it ! All of you fitting in this box is like seriously freaked up . Nonsense ! Why , there 's a whole universe in there . Dude . There 's a universe in all of us . Right on , Professor Freaksworth . Get a job ! We have the box . Everyone pull your wires . Hurry ! Back to universe A ! Hermes , don 't press that button ! OK . Bye bye . So long your Majesty ! There but for the flip of a coin go we . So , hum , Leela , seen now the universe wasn 't destroyed , you want to catch an ape fight ? You know , together ? Well , I guess you deserve one more flip ... So ? Heads or tails ? You know , let just say it 's heads . Ready ? 1 , 2 , 3 , pull ! There . That space time inversion has given us their box . And vice-versa ! So what you 've think you 've just explained to us is that ... Correct ! This box contains our own universe ! Sweet honey bee of infinity ! Bender , quit destroying the universe ! Yes , all that is and ever shall be is in that box ! And the box itself is probably worth something to . We must cherish it as we cherish every moment of our lives . synchro by : Adam Rambousek joke0 June 17th , 2003 - v1

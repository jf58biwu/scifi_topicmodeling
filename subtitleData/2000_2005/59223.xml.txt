 If you move before my signal , hit what you 're aiming at . I need my other spear . I 'll chase it to you . Try and fucking hit it . Get it ! Get it ! How 's that for hitting what I aim at ? You little shit-ass . Jesus ! Holy shit ! It was an accident . The sun got in my eyes . Besides , he was an asshole . - What do we tell the tribe ? - It was an accident . Let 's leave the body . We 'll see what my father says . - I feel a storm coming . - Shit . Let 's go . I hate outside . Come on . Let 's go . The outside is beautiful . My brother was like you . They found his bones picked clean . Did you catch something ? is it meat ? I haven 't had meat in months . David , I heard someone was killed . I thought ... . It was Nathaniel . He fell off a cliff . I need to see my father . So he 's dead and we still don 't have any food to give to the tribe ? Send children to do a man 's job . - Where 's the body ? - We hid it . - You told them he fell off a cliff ? - Yes . Okay , fuck it . The Lord works in mysterious ways . God blesses us with this meat . As we enjoy it , let us remember our brother Nathaniel who died to bring it to us . Bow your fucking heads . And let his death also remind us that God rules this world , not us . The storm he sent to destroy the ancients still casts its shadow on us . Striking without warning , killing without mercy . Do you know God speaks to me ? He does . He speaks to me . He says as long as we know our place and don 't increase our numbers to beyond that which the caves can hold , we will survive ! We will . He tells me other things too . He tells me about the sin in your hearts . He tells me about your fucking desires to fornicate . Though it 'll bring more children than he allows . He tells me of young people wanting to give in to their filthy sexual curiosity . Look outside ! Look at what that curiosity did to the ancients . Remember the Lord 's words . Let me hear you . - God is coming and he 's pissed . - Louder ! - God is coming and he 's pissed . - Again ! - God is coming and he 's pissed ! - That 's right ! He 's coming . And don 't ever forget it . As you know , I 've had to serve God on my own since he took my wife . But in his infinite wisdom he has chosen a handmaiden to assist me . Now our leader has led us well , wouldn 't you agree ? Right ? He has . God has chosen to recognize and reward your service . He 's chosen your daughter , Sarah . I will tutor Sarah in the service of our Lord . She 'll be as a daughter to me . Enjoy your meat . And may the mercy of God be with you all . It 's a good day . I just found out a few minutes ago . - Is this what you want ? - It 's a great honour . " See him grow worried when he blows a clinker . " Give me that . You learned to read to fill your head with this shit ? This is the old world ! God destroyed them for their sins . Is that what you want ? You want to die like that ? We need books that will teach us to survive . Useful books ! - Books on weather , biology- - - Useful ? Yes . Like these ? You love to talk about sin . Is this research ? Like when you fucked Elizabeth ? Oh , no , God selected her . The same way that he selected Sarah . God is another name for your dick . - Shut up and listen . - No , you listen . Lay a hand on Sarah- - - Don 't give me orders , boy . - No , it 's a warning . You touch her and I will tell everyone . About Joshua too . Look , this is not about him . I see how you look at Sarah . Don 't worry , I 'll share her with you . When I saw you 'd taught yourself how to read , I had high hopes for you . I really did . So I showed you my secrets . And you shared my knowledge with your sinner friends ? I know that you 've been teaching them to read . I know everything ! I am loved ! The people obey me without question . I have everything I need without risking my neck on the hunt . I 'm more powerful than the leader . You can have this . Shove it up your ass ! Go ahead ! Go ahead . You ready ? Go ahead . I didn 't think so . Vincent , was it really an accident with Nathaniel ? He was an asshole . I 'm not gonna miss him . - But I didn 't do it on purpose . - He was a bad leader . - If I had led the hunt- - - Heather , women can 't lead . - They 're weak and delicate . - I 'll show you . - You want to mess ? Let 's go ! - Bring it on , motherfucker ! - Come on ! - Get off ! Don 't make me hurt you ! I 'd like to see you try . Where 's David ? If we get caught- - The rules ! Fuck the rules ! Rules were made up by the elders to keep us scared and stupid . They don 't want us to know how the old world was . But I know . I 've read the books . People lived in huge cities that stretched up to the sky . They had heat and cool air when they wanted . - So they never went outside ? - They did . Always . They weren 't nature 's slaves , but its masters . They could do anything imagined . If we keep studying them , one day we 'll re-create that world . - Not if your father is leading . - He won 't live forever . We 're the future of this tribe . Come on , let 's start your lesson . " Dear Penthouse Forum : I never believed those articles you printed were true until my con- -conservative wife asked me to ream her bunghole with a ' veebrating daldo . " ' Vibrating dildo . How many times have we been over the " l " ' s ? I 've never heard these words . I don 't know what a bunghole is . But I bet your father does . That 's why you 're mad . Your dad 's gonna fill up your girl with " God . " Damn right I 'm angry ! I 'm sick and tired of his lies . Tell them what he did to you , Elizabeth . Come on . We 're friends . - It 's okay . Tell us . - What is it ? He asked me to his room to show me something . - It was his spear . - I 'll give you a spear . Shut up ! He said God wanted it inside me , but I didn 't want it inside me . He said if I didn 't , God would be mad and I 'd get worse than a whipping . Bastard ! But what can we do about it ? Give him a vibrating dildo and shove it up his bunghole . Shit ! - Do you like the cave ? - It 's nice . This is where God appeared to me and said , " Sarah ! " He chose you . Isn 't that an honour , to be chosen to serve God ? You 're not like the others . They 're dirty . You 're clean . God chose you . A great honour to serve God , isn 't it ? You 'll get to serve God . You 've been chosen . You 've been chosen . My body is the temple . My seed is the sacrament . - Prepare to accept the Lord . - No , please . No , please . No ! - Please , no ! - It 's okay . God said this is how it should be . - Now don 't make a sound . - No ! - You little fucker ! - No ! Please don 't ! - Don 't hurt him ! - I 'm gonna kill you ! - Don 't hurt him ! - I will kill you ! - I 'll kill you ! - Don 't hurt him ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Dad ? - Time to die , pretty boy . - Get off me , man ! Get in there ! Kill him before God destroys us all . Kill him ! You killed your father . You fucked up , pretty boy . We 'll take care of that princess for you . How 's that ? Stop following me . What the fuck was he thinking ? Was he supposed to let him rape her ? That spoiled bitch ? I would have . She followed me . God damn it , Sarah . Turn around and walk out of here . It 's your fault he 's gonna die . Unless we do something . Come on ! What are you doing ? They 'll kill you . Get out of here ! - This is crazy . - Hurry up . - Get out of here ! - Let 's get the fuck out of here . Hurry ! Hold me up . You shouldn 't have done this . Go back . - You know what they 'll do to us ? - I 'm never going back . You 're the closest thing to a family I have , David . We always talked about starting over . We have no choice . We find shelter , there 's no food . We find food , there 's no shelter . Think of something else besides how tired you are . That 's hard to do when your legs are falling off . I 'm sick of walking ! Did I tell you ? In the old cities , no one ever went hungry . Any food you wanted , you didn 't have to hunt . - Just go to a store . - Bet they never had to walk this much . - I 'm tired ! - They never had to walk . They had cars that moved faster than the wind . - And things like this never happened ? - Never . No one told you what to do . You could do what you wanted . - Are we there yet ? - I 'm tired . - Holy fuck ! - Wow ! It 's beautiful ! - What the fuck 's that ? - It 's so big . Is this real ? It 's a city . We 're going there . - Let 's go . - I feel a storm coming . - My God , where are we ? - Are we in hell ? - It hurts ! - It 's over there . - No , in there . - I don 't care where . Make it stop ! I kind of like it . Who the hell is that ? What are you doing ? You trying to scare them to death ? - I 'm making an entrance , darling . - Oh , really ? I 'm Neil . And this ravishing creature is Judith . Welcome to our home . Oh , my God , they 're so beautiful . Now I understand . All of these things are ancient . But they work . You have power . How ? Solar , baby . The tree-huggers were right . That is the way to go . Check it out . - That 's great ! - What 's in here ? Some of these things I recognize . But what are these ? What we have here are important relics of the past that we 've rescued . - Come here , Josh . Try this . - Check out the chair . It 's spinning . Art from a fertile period in human creativity known as the ' 80s . The baseball Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run . Stay behind the velvet ropes . - I know what that is ! It 's a TV . - Watch this . - Look at that ! - There are people in there . No , it 's just a picture . A moving picture . My God , look at it ! What is this place ? It was a biotech research complex . Now it 's home . - It can be yours . - It 's our dream . You said we 'd find it . You were right , it 's all real . This is just the beginning . We have a whole world to show you . Let 's start with a hot bath . Oh , shit . - Well , do you want a bath or not ? - I want a bath . There 's a brave boy . It scared me . I 'm going in . Scary . - What 's the matter ? - You 're naked . You 're naked too . This water feels good . - Won 't you join us ? - There 's not enough room . We 'll squeeze together . We cleaned you up and put those clothes on you . This is your new home . We 've already seen everything so there 's no need to be shy . It 's what we always dreamed of . Come on . Yeah ! - Are you all right ? - I was taught your body is private . My guess is , all of your lives , others have been telling you what to do . And what not to do . Imagine the whipping we 'd get back in the caves . You have no hair . - It 's like in the magazines . - Penthouse ! - You noticed . - Oh , yeah ! It 's called shaving . We 're glad that we found you . We thought there was no one left alive . There were some a long time ago , but they died . Diseases spread like wildfire . - How did you survive ? - We didn 't get sick . - How many people are in your tribe ? - About 35 , 40 . You know about the ancients . David says in the old times no one could tell you what to do . Not exactly . But if you had the balls- - They couldn 't stop you from living how you want . Where you come from isn 't like that ? - No . And no one like you either . - I 'll have to visit . This conversation is scintillating , but I 'm hungry . And I bet you are too . - I never played dress-up . - Want clothes like ours ? Is this for girls ? - All right , who 's first ? - Me . - Sure , anyone else ? - Untie this . I 've the perfect outfit for you . - David , what 's wrong ? - It 's just everything . - Guys , check this out . - Turn around . - Hell , they 're cool . - Okay , check it out ! Oh , yeah ! I really like that . It looks like Bianca Jagger 's suit . - Neat ! - Who 's that ? I don 't know . For a minute , I forgot about what happened at the cave . What I did . - You had no choice . - I think you should take those off . - It 's your butt ! - Those are weird-looking . I don 't want her telling me what to wear . I think that 'll look nice on you . Look at me ! - What do you think ? - Looks good . How do you put this on ? - Turn around . - That 's so cute ! Look at you ! Where have you been , beautiful ? You shouldn 't wander around alone . Some predators have survived . Cougars , wolves , whatever . - Something wrong ? - You 're not like us . - Give the boy a gold star . - Yes ! It 's getting dark out . The predators come out at night . Let 's get you some clothes . Tight ones . Nice ass . We were students . The scientists knew the weather was gonna change forever . They recruited kids for medical experiments . Sleep deprivation , ESP studies . This time it was genetic engineering . They were trying to find a way to improve people so they 'd be able to survive . - How old do you think I am ? - About 21 , 22 ? I was born 1 20 years ago . They changed us . At first , I was afraid to die . - Then I prayed I would . - That doesn 't sound good . Those scientists saved our lives . They made us better . I can hear your heart beating . When you 're old , I 'll be like this . So shut the fuck up ! Neil , calm down . Calm down . Sorry . I ... . Sorry ! You shouldn 't pass judgment upon things you don 't understand . What we are can be frightening . That 's why we didn 't tell you sooner . Your friends respect you . So , could we count on you to let them know in a way that won 't scare them ? Of course . We won 't do that . You said there were others that were experimented on . What happened ? Well , the process , the change is rough on the body . We came through okay . I 'm talking about the grass , right ? This is the finest stuff available , right , Judith ? I make it myself . The cocaine 's evolution begins in my hydroponic garden where the coca plant grows . And then I synthesize it in my lab until it 's like nectar ! Chill out . You don 't want to try to keep up with me ! Have a drink . Try some of this , Sarah . - No , thanks . - I 'm sorry . I forgot you 're royalty . - To royalty ! - Royalty ! Yeah ! Heather 's always been like one of the boys , huh ? But ... . How was it ? Say , " Yeah ! " Say , " Line ! " You want a fucking line ? You say , " Hey ! " There 's no rules here . I got dopes . That was a quick demonstration to get you started . Think of Judith and I as teachers . There 's a lot more for us to teach you than turning on the TV or taking a bath , et cetera , et cetera . Easy . If you overdo it , you 'll be useless to me . Yeah ! - I 'm getting stripped . - Oh , no . - You see she 's not one of the boys ? - Shut up . What ? David , why don 't you kiss Sarah 's neck ? - Bye-bye ! - No , I 'll go with you . David , come on ! You think you 're too good for us ? Judith , relax . It 's all new to them . They 're scared . You 're right . You can do anything here . It 's okay to be scared . You get to do what you want , or not . All right ? - All right . - Have a good time ! But you know what ? Sarah ! You 're missing something quite special because sex with us is like nothing you 've ever fucking imagined . And our ... . Our heightened senses will ... . Ta-ta , darling ! Okay , guys . Heather , you should lay down . Get comfortable . Yeah , take your clothes off . There are no rules here ! No rules allowed . He 's a mess , isn 't he , Judith ? - Yes , there we go ! - Whatever you call these things . Whoa ! The legend is true . Pound for pound , it 's the biggest dick I 've seen in years ! Thank you . Yeah , that 's it . Take her down . Lay her down gently . That 's it , Joshua . Take it slow , fellas . Ladies like to be touched softly . Softly ! Wake up , man . Be gentle to the lady . - You hit me . - I 'll fucking hit you . It 's your fault . I 'm not doing nothing . Just stay still . I don 't think you 're doing it right ! - Give me the bottle . I don 't want you . - Your bottle ? What is wrong with you ? You don 't know what you 're fucking doing ! - She 's fucking a child . - It ain 't over yet . What are you doing ? Why don 't you lay down ? - I 'm gonna tell my mom . - We 'll talk to your mom later . There you go ! Open the cap , motherfucker . You ain 't doing anything to make me jealous . - It 's falling out . - Let me show you . - All right . - He 's not doing it right . You want me to show you what it 's like ? Okay , spread your legs , darling . I 'll just do what Vincent wanted to do . I 'll show you how . - Tell me if it hurts . - What you looking at ? Back up a bit , Vincent . And stay quiet and fucking learn something . - Man , I ain 't gotta learn . - Yeah , man ! - Okay , you ready ? - Yeah . - You want a drink , Joshua ? - No . - What 's happening to him ? - Oh , my God ! - How do I take it off ? - You just push it together . What are you doing ? Oh , God . That was fantastic . Thanks . Yes ! Oh , God . Take a load off , sweetheart . Oh , honey , what 's the matter ? I 'm ... . I 'm sick . My whole body hurts . What 's wrong with me ? I 'm surprised it 's happening so soon . I took two days , you took a week . It 'll be a lot easier if you- - Oh , God . Kids . Joshua , wake up . Oh , God , please don 't hurt me . We won 't . We just like to watch . Holy shit ! - Goddamn it . - Oops . Guys . We can 't find Elizabeth anywhere . Maybe she went with Neil and Judith . She 's around somewhere . This is serious . She could be hurt or sick . Or asleep . With Neil and Judith . Would you stop arguing and help us go look ? Stop telling us what to do . You sound like your father . They said not to wander around when she isn 't here . They 'll help us find her . Man , you missed out last night . - I didn 't know about that stuff . - I did . I read Penthouse . - Where 's Elizabeth ? - Elizabeth 's sick . Measles . Measles ? She 'll be fine . We have medicine . But she had to be isolated . See ? If we would 've been at the caves , she 'd die . But she 'll be fine . - I wanna see her . - You want to get sick ? I 'd like to see her too . All right . But only one of you . Neil , take Sarah . And I 'll get the medicine ready . Did you hear the lady , David ? Why don 't you follow me ? And we 'll get a mask so you don 't get sick . Come on . Did you get anything from Sarah ? I got some from all the girls . He 's a man now too . She 's in here . This is for your safety . - What are you doing here ? - We were worried about you . That 's sweet . They say I 'll be here a while . But they 're taking good care of me . - Are you all right ? - I feel dizzy . We better get you out of here . - Tell everyone I say hello . - I will . I 'm going to the bedroom . - How is she ? - I 'm not sure . What do you mean ? Well , she 's sick , but she doesn 't seem that bad . She was smiling . - She said to say hi . - Told you . Sorry we scared you . - I know how you can make it up to us . - Maybe this afternoon . But just for you . You idiot ! Why 'd you let her turn around ? She saw me . She didn 't . She saw what you wanted her to . What did I say , motherfucker ? She saw me . Even if she did , it was for , what , two seconds ? - She 'll think she imagined it . - She 's already sketchy . - We planned this out so carefully . - Fuck our plans ! I 'm tired of walking around on eggshells . If she gets too suspicious , I 'll kill her . - How do you do that ? - It 's easy for me . I was a better hunter than any of those bungholes . - So , how was it with David ? - How was what ? I thought you were gonna fuck . We 're not in the caves . No one will stop us here . - It was great . Ask Elizabeth . - We can 't get near her . - What are you afraid of ? - I don 't want to . Why ? You were there , you saw . You weren 't curious ? - No . I don 't like them . - Not even Judith ? Judith 's every fantasy you can imagine . Even the ones you can 't . - What 's wrong ? - Something wrong with it ? - There 's something wrong with you . - I see the boys have found their toys . You 've worked up a sweat . I hope you haven 't tired yourselves out . Like the song , " Looking forward to a little afternoon delight . " - I want some delight . - They don 't understand . That 's one good thing about the end of the world . - Are you coming ? - Sure . Bye . You know where to find us if you change your mind . - Do you wanna go ? - I wanna be with you . Oh , how cute . - Not like that . - When ? We do everything else . I suck your dick . You act like it 's gonna fucking kill you . I want meat . I 'm going hunting . - I 'm a hunter . Can I come ? - Yeah . God , it 's beautiful . All the parts fit together perfectly . Like a woman . Like a beautiful woman . If you want me to leave you alone , say the word . You know what I mean . It 's just , everything 's so perfect here . In the caves everything was about surviving . Here it 's about living . I feel ... . I 've only been here a few days , but I feel like I 'm home . I haven 't felt that way since my family died . - You 've been better to me than anyone . - Listen , kid . Stop , okay ? And Judith ! God , sex with her is like nothing else in the world . When we were stuck in the storms , I thought I 'd die a virgin . Now , I 'm in love with her . She says I have a big cock . And God , man , I didn 't know a woman could get so wet . She tells me she wants it harder or faster . Her sweat 's- - Oh , no , no . No ! - Is he dead ? - Whoa . - What happened ? - I told him about the predators . I told him not to go off on his own . I told all of you ! Why don 't you listen ? Huh ? Why don 't you fucking listen ? - What animal did that ? - Shut up ! I told you all . Why don 't you fucking listen to me , motherfuckers ? ! Or look what happens to your friend . He wore these goddamn things everywhere . You don 't believe that predator story any more than I do . I can 't believe it . After my father used to hit me , he 'd always yell at me . Blame it on me . " Why did you make me do that ? " " Why don 't you listen to me ? " He made it my fault . That 's what Neil sounded like in there . My father . What I don 't understand is why didn 't they just let us die ? Why take us in and be so nice to us ? Why not just let us die in the storm ? I don 't know . We need to figure it out before Neil makes it our fault . The worst thing you could do is give me that predator bullshit . I can smell . The funny thing is the only smell was yours . Baby , he was talking about fucking you . I see . I 'm supposed to sit there and not react ? After 90 years I 'm supposed to just sit there ? You fucking bitch ! And listen to some caveboy talk about fucking you ? Are you jealous ? is that what this is ? You disgust me ! For the past 20 years , touching you has turned my stomach . - I thought of killing myself . - Me too . I tried it more than once . There was no reason to go on ! - You disgust me ! - I heard that already . You may think you were happy here but all I know is , I 've seen you turn into a hollow , empty shell . And living with you is like sleeping next to a corpse ! - When those kids came along- - - I haven 't seen the real Judith since ! The first time I saw her was when you bitched about Sarah . You 've been putting on this little act . Fucking look at you , like a bad " B " movie . - You know that boy you killed ? - Yeah . I fucking enjoyed it . It 's good you enjoyed it because he reminded me of you . Before you died inside ! Before you fucked me and infected me with this virus ! You volunteered for those experiments . Or have you forgotten that part ? - You wanna say something ? - I swear , I 'll kill myself ! Well , call it then , lady . I love you , for chrissakes . Leave me alone ! Baby , baby . Come on ... . Do you understand me ? Now you leave me alone ! Do you understand ? ! Yeah , I understand . It 's not that it doesn 't hurt , David . With my heightened senses it hurts me worse than it would hurt you . Then , why are you doing it ? Oh , trying to remember what it was like when pain meant something . Where are the others ? They wanted to be alone , but I was in the mood for a drink . Well , yea ! Come , come . Come play . Over here . Time to get drunk . Getting drunk with the boys . - Oh , Cutty ! - I found it down in the warehouse . - It 's good . - My favourite . - Is it ? You can have some if you want . - I know . To Joshua . Some fucking women . Oh , let 's not talk about women . I haven 't had sex with Judith in 20 years . 20 years ? - 20 years . - Sarah 's kind of been a bitch too . I noticed . What do you see in that girl ? Come on , man . I don 't know . She just doesn 't want to have any fun . - Yeah , what 's up with that ? - I don 't know . - So , you 're getting drunk ? - Yeah . I don 't know what to do . I just wanted to have a drink , to kill the pain . Been there , done that . Plan on doing a hell of a lot more of it . Oh , look , look . I made this myself , right ? It 's guaranteed to kill any pain . But first I used to play this game with my brother . Oh , okay , so you go , you make your throat , like , small and you go ... . You clamp the top of your throat . Like you 're restricting your breath . Oh , a natural . So now , take a big breath in and do it as long as you can . - I got big lungs , so pace yourself . - All right . I can 't do it . You won . - Oh , drugs . - Drugs . Looking to kill the pain . Look since I 'm such a nice guy , I 'll share this with you . You 're the only one I 'd do this for . There you go . Bye , pain . You know what ? It 's okay . Get the fuck out of here . - Judith , could I talk to you ? - Let me finish and I 'll find you . I shouldn 't have bothered you . I don 't know what I was thinking . Wait . I can finish this later . What 's on your mind ? I don 't wanna talk here , Neil could walk in on us . - Your heart 's beating fast . You okay ? - I 'm nervous . The best method to pass the virus is through intercourse but oral sex is just as effective . Elizabeth changed six hours after infection . The process killed her . Studying her body and comparing it to ours will help us understand why Neil and myself survive and why others don 't . Sarah . I can 't wake Neil . Neil ! Fuck ! You 're scaring the kids . - Dinosaurs . - What ? We 're dinosaurs from a world that 's dead and gone . Watch this . A priest and a rabbi are outside a church and a boy walks by and the priest says " Let 's fuck him " and the rabbi says " Out of what ? " They 'll never be like us no matter what- - That 's enough ! Go pass out . Good night . We 'll finish later . - Elizabeth 's dead because of sex ? - They make you see things . They 're trying to make us like them . - They live forever . Sounds good . - If you make it . Elizabeth didn 't . Her ribs burst out , her spine snapped ! - I had sex with one . I 'm gonna die ! - No , Vincent did too . If you had it , you 'd already be dead . All I know is that we have to get the fuck out of here . Fuck ! Here 's what we 'll do . I 'll wreck the trucks so they can 't follow . Then we 'll go . Sarah , you and Heather stay here . Vincent , if they come out of their room , you gotta tell us . - He said to stay . - How long do we wait ? - I don 't know . - I 'm freaking out . I 'm scared . You 're okay . We 're gonna get out of here . You 're not infected . - Thank you , Sarah . - Heather , you 're hurting me ! - I 'm sorry . - You scared me . - Heather 's dead , just like Elizabeth . - Shit ! Okay , we have to get out of here . Let 's wait a bit , then we 'll get out of here , okay ? They 're all dead , David . We could die too . - Baby , don 't say that . - Why not ? It 's true . Even if I die today , at least I 'd be with you . There 'd only be one thing I 'd regret . - You sure ? - I can 't die without making love to you . Okay , look . - You were Sarah . - No , I made you think I was . Think that little virgin can fuck you like me ? How could you ? Let me get up . Come out . Although you 've missed the best part . Sarah , it 's not what it looks like . - Welcome to the group . - How could you tell them ? - You 're one of them . - You 've been initiated . - How long ? - Earlier today . I was scared , just like you . But you 'll see . Nathaniel called me a runt . Now I 'm more powerful than him . I can crush stones with my hands . I will live forever . I 'm God ! Humanity 's day is done . If you 're not like us , there 's no point . You 'll find out . - Or I 'll die . - If you do , what a way to go , huh ? - Fuck you ! - Don 't fight . It 's already in you . Sit down , brother . Waiting 's hard , so we thought we 'd help you out . Good news : We made an injection to help you tolerate the change . Fuck you ! Bad news : Live or die , you 're in a world of hurt , brother . Enjoy the ride , David . You 're hurting ! You 're hurting ! Ouch ! Oh , my God ! Is this what the world looks like to you ? - It worked . - The smell . What is that smell ? What smell ? There are so many smells . What is it ? Can I hear your heart beating ? - I bet you can even hear Sarah 's . - Amazing , isn 't it ? Try this one . - That was Mark McGwire 's ball ! - David ! David , go . Go rescue her , David . Save the little princess . You can 't imagine . I was deaf , dumb and blind before . My God , the power ! I feel like I could tear this place apart . Heather 's dead ! She went through the same thing as you except her body twisted inside out . We 'll take the human species to a new level . Normal people can 't survive . For the human race to continue , it must evolve . You 'll all understand . Tell them , Neil . We reproduce by passing on the virus . We didn 't think there was anyone to pass it to until we found your tribe . Some we 'll make like us . Others we 'll leave so they can repopulate the world . At worst , they 'll live in greater comfort than ever . At best , they 'll be immortal . - And if they don 't want to ? - You 're fucking stupid ! I 'm talking about starting civilization over again . We can make a world that 's paradise because we 'll always rule it . Sarah , just trust me . Everything 's gonna be fine . - Baby , it 's gonna be fine . - And what happens to me now ? - I fucked all the girls , except you . - Oh , don 't hurt us , we 're monsters . First , clamp down on this . Pull the pin and toss it . And gas is gonna come out . - I can smell that from here . - Flush your buddies out . Give them a chance to surrender . If they put up a fight ... . - Put the gun down . - When can I shoot ? - I don 't want anyone hurt . - Put it down . They 'll see reason . - What if there 's a storm ? - Mine 's loaded . - I want my own gun . - We can detect storms before they hit . - Plenty of time to find shelter . - Relax , David . - We 're not out to hurt anyone . - When do I get a gun ? When I say ! Now get the fuck off my ass ! I ain 't finished . Get here ! - When can I shoot ? - When I say so ! We leave tomorrow . Dismissed . I got that , beautiful . Thank you . - When can I shoot ? - Hey , get off my ass ! - Fuck . - Fuck what ? Boys , boys . I know that you feel like I betrayed you but you don 't understand . This is incredible . - Unless I die . - There 's no chance of that now . You really believe that ? I don 't want to . Does that matter ? - I 'm making you immortal . - No ! You 're forcing your will on me because you think you know better . Your father would be proud . Judith wants to see you . Both of you . It 's your time . - You 're gonna be hurting , girl . - It 's time . - I 'm doing this for you . - Then kill me . Hurry up , David . I want my turn . We all want our turn . What 's the matter ? Now that I 'm like you , she doesn 't do anything for me . Poor boy . I 've spoiled you . You son of a bitch ! Go get her ! Oh , now you want me . Now what am I gonna do with you ? Where 's she at ? I want her . I smell pussy . Come here . Let me go . Let me go ! Time for what David couldn 't do . - Fuck you ! - Shut up , bitch ! Fuck you ! What 's that ? You want a kiss ? Of course , sweetheart . Don 't tell anyone I give good head . Did you see David ? Did your boyfriend run out on you ? Men are pigs . Maybe Vincent saw him . Goddamn it , where is Vincent ? - Right here . - No . He was attacking Sarah . You gave me no choice . Tell them , you little bitch . He 's lying . He didn 't have to kill him . I did it for us , baby . He was getting in the way . - You killed my baby . - I did it for us . He was no good for you . All right ? Let me kill them so it can be just you and me , baby . I 'll change . I promise . I 'll make you happy . No ! You fuck , you fucked me up . You stop it ! You fucked my family . I fucking hate you ! You killed my baby . Why did you have to do that ? - I fucking hate you ! I hate you ! - Stop ! Stop , baby- - I 'm so sorry , baby . Wake up . Wake up , baby , please ! Come on . Don 't leave me here , baby . Wake up . Baby , I would have changed . I would have changed , baby . This is their fault . This is their fault . Ah , shit ! Judith . What are we gonna do ? Get out of here , Sarah . Get out ! It 's all right . Whatever 's in him is in me too . Give her a monster fuck . Not easy to control , is it ? I was hoping we could have fun with Sarah , but you want to stay human . Humans are no longer relevant . I guess Sarah and I will have to party without you . You okay there ? Rule number one : We may be bad-asses but we still need to breathe . You 're a looner . Just a minute . How 's it hanging , David ? Sarah , where are you going ? I see you . And even if I didn 't , I 'd smell your- - You fuck ! Fuck ! Love makes you stupid ! Hey , freak ! Old world dead . You killed her . You killed Judith ! You fuck , Sarah . You slut ! You fucking cunt ! It 's over . They 're dead . All the monsters are dead . You should go back to the tribe . What are you talking about ? I want to stay with you . I 'm not like you . We can 't be together . If we ever made love , you could die . I 'm taking the kids . Subtitles by SDI Media Group

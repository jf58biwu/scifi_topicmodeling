 So far away again . Sometimes I think I hardly knew you . They were scampering off into the jungle like , well , like two frightened schoolchildren ! They were raptors , Challenger ! Baby raptors . Oh , Veronica , you should have seen them . Maybe I will . I 'm going for a swim . - Oh , do you want some company ? - Not really . But thanks . - Okay . - Veronica ? Are you all right ? Uh-huh , I 'll be back in a little bit . I think you broke the poor girl 's heart , Malone . You know , I 've been thinking about that myself , despite her denials , I think she may well be in love with him . I 'm not so sure about that . Well , we talked about it a little while ago . Good friends , she said . No more than that . Afraid to take a chance if you ask me . No ! Veronica 's just reach a time in her life when she wants ... to fall in love , but not necessarily with Malone . But it 's definitely with someone . Where am I ? What 's going on ? At last you 've come to see me . Do I know you ? Oh , I 've been waiting for your visit ever since ... I first laid eyes on you . Do you like my music ? Yes , I like it very much . I wrote it just for you . For me ? My dream come true . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World That 's that was incredible . You wrote that just for me . Yes . I did . I 've never seen a real piano before . - Can I touch it ? - Certainly . Sit down . Don 't be afraid . Who are you ? My name is Thomas Ducart . I 've seen you many times in the village . Perhaps you 've noticed me as well ? No , I 've never been here before . I live in the jungle that surrounds this place . - Jungle ? - That 's where I was born . I 've been through this valley lots of times ... and I 've never seen your village here . Ah , such an imagination . But I 'm afraid there aren 't ... many jungles in Germany these days . Not Germany ! South America ! A lost plateau in the Amazon jungle ? My parents came here before I was born . And how long ago was that ? 1895 . 1895 ! Its only 1822 ! No , it 's 1922 ! Eighteen ... twenty two was a hundred years ago . We should be back by late tomorrow afternoon . I don 't know why you don 't wait for the morning ... and make an early start . - My sentiments exactly . - Well we could , but either way it 'll take more than a day to get there ... and back so we may as well get started . Did I really volunteer for this ? We all need bullets , Marguerite , and without sulphur ... - we 'll soon be out of gunpowder . - Wouldn 't you rather go alone ? Well , I need someone to carry the sulphur . Do I look like a pack mule to you ! Absolutely not ! Which is why I 'm anxious for your company . So , get off that fine tush of yours and let 's get going . - See you tomorrow , George . - Good luck ! Are you sure you don 't need my organizational skills around here ? Oh , I think I can manage without you , Marguerite . Although I will miss your sunny disposition . Well , whatever force brought us together , we were destined to meet . But you think I 'm someone else . Well , yes , yes , I thought ... you were a young woman I 've often seen here , but ... hey ! I 'm clearly mistaken . You 're nothing like her at all . It must be your clothes that caused the confusion . I don 't even know how I came to be wearing these clothes . You 're from another place or time or ... a ghost or something . This whole place it can 't be real . Well , you know , I feel alive , very much so . I mean , don 't I feel alive to you ? Yes . I can 't stay . I have to get back to my friends . Well , then , may I come with you ? I want to meet your friends and ... see for myself this ... strange world you talk about . I 'd like that very much . What happened to your clothes ? This is what I always wear . You 're beautiful ! A goddess . Thank you . And this place ! It is a jungle ! Everything you said , it 's true ! So you 're not disappointed ? No , no , far from it . It 's like I 've been given a second chance to live life . It 's wonderful ! It 's extraordinary . I 'm glad you like it . What like ? I love it ! It 's all because of you , the most ... amazing thing that 's ever happened to me ! How , how can this be ? My friend Challenger might be able to explain it . Come on . I should have done this a long time ago . A place for everything ... and everything in its place . I can 't wait for you to meet him . Challenger ! - He 's probably in his lab . - It 's incredible ! Challenger ! What happened ? Oh , are you all right ? Where am I ? I must have banged my head when I fell off the ladder . You 've got quite a bump . Well , who 's your friend ? You 're lucky you didn 't fracture your skull . I 'm not sure you didn 't . I daresay I have a slight concussion , no more than that . Well , a concussion can be serious , and sudden movements can make it worse . You tell him . You should take it easy for a few days at least . I hope you 're listening . How is it that a musician knows so much about medicine . Well , I studied medicine briefly at the university . But music has always been my passion . You should have heard him play , Challenger . It was amazing . I could have listened to him play for hours . And I could play for you forever . Yes , well I would like to visit this village of yours myself . Not until your head 's better . Your appearance here seems to defy rational explanation . No it doesn 't , well , not for you . Strange things happen all the time around here . Well , yes . I suppose it could have something to do with harmonics . Etheric vibrations caused by your music could ... have ripped you and your village from their natural ... - place in time and space . - See ... I told you I could explain it . I 'm not sure that I have . You could still be no more than some ... supernatural apparition . Well , Veronica and I have already ... established that I 'm not a ghost . What do you recall of your life in Germany ? I remember growing up , going to school , studying music ... everything right up until this morning . Did you recall anything unusual ? Well , no , not until Veronica walked into my life . I see . The conditions that led to your sudden appearance here ... may not be permanent . Are you saying I could disappear again . As quickly as you arrived . But until I know more about this phenomenon , I can 't possibly draw any logical conclusions . Do we have to talk about this right now ? Come here . I want to show you something . - What is it ? - Wait and see . It 's Mozart ! Concerto number 21 ! - Isn 't it amazing ? - Absolutely ! - Whatever is this machine ? - It 's called a gramophone . Such clarity ! It 's like actually being in an orchestra pit ! Isn 't he fantastic ? I can see how attracted you are to him , Veronica . But he may not be as charming as he appears to be . - What are you saying ? - Just be careful . And stay out of that village . As I said , it could vanish as quickly as it materialized . And you do not want to be caught in it if it does . I can take care of myself , Challenger . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , no no , no . - Are you hurt ? - I 'm I 'm fine . I 'm just afraid ... I 've broken your machine , that 's all ! It 's okay . Challenger can fix it . It must have been lonely living here all by yourself . Sometimes . But I got to know a lot of the tribes that live here ... as well as most of the animals . But you never found out what happened to your family . Oh ! Not yet . But I think they 'd like to meet you . - What is it ? - Triceratops , I think . What ? A dinosaur ! Come on ! Thomas ! Thomas ! Are you all right ? No broken bones . Well , that was one of the less friendly inhabitants . You saved my ... We really should be going in case he comes back . I never thought it could be like this . Better than this it could never be . I feel like I 'm in a dream . Oh you feel wonderful to me ! Well , it 's still there . The mist at least . Oh , I 'm sure my village is there . Do you think Challenger 's right about it being unstable ? Well I hope not ! I must see you again tomorrow . I 'll be waiting right here for you . Good morning , Challenger . How 's your head today ? Oh , a little better , I think ... though I had a splitting headache last night . You should take it easy for a couple of days , like Thomas suggested . I take it you 're going off to see him again . Yes , if it 's all right with you . He broke this on purpose , you know . Why would he do that ? To interrupt our conversation . He didn 't like what I was saying about his intentions . Neither did I ! You 're wrong about him . You don 't think you 're rushing things a little ? No ! I don 't trust him , Veronica ! You need to be more careful . I can take care of myself , Challenger ! I always have . We all make mistakes ... especially when it comes to matters of the heart . Mistakes ! Is that what you think he is ? No . Worse than that . I think he 's dangerous . You don 't know what you 're talking about ! He makes me very happy ! I think you should stay away from him . I 'm not a little girl , Challenger ! And you 're not my father ! If I were I wouldn 't let you leave this treehouse . Oh really ! Well , just watch this ! Veronica ! Some shortcut , Roxton . Stop your complaining , Marguerite . You 're the one who was so anxious to get back to the treehouse ! Besides , who looks like a pack mule here , huh ! Strange . I haven 't seen the valley ... choked up with fog like this before . It 'd better not be choked up with dinosaurs ! - What is going on ? - Who knows ? How ... how did this happen ? I have no idea but you look stunning . You look pretty dapper yourself ! Yes , I do look pretty damn sharp , don 't I ? Some sort of uniform . Which prompts the question , where the hell are we ? Looks like a German village . Where on earth are we ? I have no idea . Are we alive again ? If we are , Ducart must be alive as well . But only until I find him . Do you hear that ? Yes . It sounds like a full orchestra ! Where would Thomas find anything like that around here ? It has to be him . Come on . This is just like being in Germany a hundred years ago . Must be some sort of illusion . I wonder if this couple can see us . Good afternoon ! - Good day , sir . - Nice weather . I guess we 're not invisible . Well , they are wearing the same kind of clothes we are . Ow ! What is it ? Something in my shoe . Sit down over here . Here we go . Such a gentleman . Excuse me ? We didn 't order this . They 're on the house . Enjoy your afternoon . Oh , Marguerite . I don 't like this place ! Oh why not ! I think it 's rather pleasant . It 's almost like being back in the civilised world . How do you know it 's not poisoned ? How do you know it 's even real ? That waiter looked and sounded real enough . Oh John ! There are many strange forces at work on this plateau . Do all of them have to be cause for alarm ? I think we should go back the way we ... came and get back to the treehouse . I am going to enjoy myself for five minutes . Why don 't you go look around ... and see if you can find yourself some trouble . - Is that what you want ? - Um-hmm . What are you waiting for . All right . I 'll be right back . You wait here . Um-hmm . What strange kind of house is that ? Ducart ! Are you up there ? Anybody home ? Who are you ? What do you want ? We 're looking for Thomas Ducart ! You wait right there ! What year did you say it is again ? 1922 . That doesn 't make any sense . How did our village get here ? Yes , well , that 's still something of a mystery to me as well . Now , tell me , Captain Melrick , why are you so concerned to find Mr. Ducart . - The man is an utter scoundrel . - I had my suspicions . In 1822 , he was married to me . Until he ran off with a young girl named Julia Gesch . She lived with her father . He sent me a letter begging that I intervene . My sister and I went after Ducart . He was hiding in a cellar under the shops in the village . When Julia learned of the scandal she had caused ... she committed suicide . - Oh , that 's terrible ! - Yes . It was terrible for us all . Oh my god ! Nadine , look at this ! That 's Veronica . No ... that 's Julia Gesch ! Now where is she ? You looking for me , Melrick ? Who the hell are you ? You know damn well who I am ! - Just take it easy with that . - Get out of here . Not until I find the woman I came here with . Get out of here ! Oh my god ! What the hell is going on here ? It 's just like 1822 all over again . Oh , no . Not again ! We really are no more than ghosts ! You died a hundred years ago ? Yes ! Yes , after ... Thomas ran off with that girl , Julia Gesch , Melrick and I went after them ... we chased them into a small village . Melrick confronted Thomas , and Thomas ... pulled a gun on him and shot him dead . What have I done ? I found the cellar that they were living in . My husband , once a great composer , now reduced to filth , living like rats . Poor girl she was innocent . What chance did she have ? My husband filled her head with lies , said she was his muse , his inspiration . How could she resist his music ? It was so beautiful ... so divine . There must be some way out of this ! I must get her back here . How pretty . I stood in the doorway , listening to his music . I could see her , reclining on the bed , enraptured ... watching him with such love in her eyes ... When she saw me , she gasped . My husband stopped playing . He turned to me ... I could see his madness then . Even when he drew his gun , I didn 't move . The bullet in my chest was like a caress . - He shot you ? - Oh , the pain was gone . He couldn 't hurt me any more . The young woman , having seen that took her own life . Yes , by drinking hemlock . A little makes a good sedative . Any more than that is fatal . How dreadful . Her father was a lowly woodcutter who lived ... in a forest near the village . He found her in the cellar . She was his only child . He must have been drawn here by Veronica . If she is with him now , her life is in terrible danger . Bravo ! Exquisite ! What are you doing here ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to disturb you . The door was open . No , no , please ! Don 't stop playing on my account . You have no business here . There 's nothing left between us . Was there ever ? Why does a man with such obvious talents ... hide himself away down here ? I 'll never play for you again , Nadine . I only married you for your money and your ... position . You knew that ! But you weren 't happy being my patron . No , no , you wanted more . I 'm not Nadine . You must be mistaking me for someone else . Oh there 's no mistake . You followed me here because you couldn 't let me go ! Move away from the door , and you 'll never see me again . Oh , no , I 'm afraid it 's too late for that . You see , I 've already killed your brother , and now ... you 're going to have to die as well . I 'm not your wife ! I don 't have a brother ! The captain , Melrick . I shot him half an hour ago . The captain ? Roxton ! He came here to defend your honour , as if you have any . You shot Roxton ! I despise you , Nadine . I always have ! And now I have found another woman , a creature so divine my music is for her and for her alone . Then play for her . I promise I won 't try and stop you . - You won 't ? - No ! Nadine ! There 's still time . Still hope . Nadine ! You must find your friends . You have to hurry . Veronica ! Wait ! Thomas ! I didn 't think you 'd come ! I never thought I 'd see you again ! I couldn 't live without you ! You 're my muse ! My inspiration ! We shall always be together ! Always ! - Hey , hey , hey ! - What 's the matter ? I think I 'm falling in love with you . And I don 't want this to end . And why does it have to end ? - I don 't want to lose you . - You never will . But Challenger said ... you could just disappear ! You , your village ... - your music ! - How ... how do you know that Challenger is right ? How does he know ? You forget about Challenger , hmm ? Has he ever been in love ? Does he even remember what it 's like ? No ! I guess not . No ! Then come and live with me , Veronica . Let my village be your home too ! But what about my friends . What need have you of friends ? Hmm ? We have each other . But I belong out here . - I 'll come see you every day . - No , no ! no , no . No , you must come with me now ... and stay with me . Forever . I can 't . At least come and listen to my music . I 'd love to . Marguerite , where are you ? - No ! - I 've been looking all over for you ! It was ghastly ! I heard a piano he ... he thought I was his wife he shot me ! It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's probably the same lunatic who shot me . He thought I was someone else as well ? Where did he go ? I don 't know . But we 've got to get out of this ... village right now . Come on ! You were right about this place . We never should have stopped here . I 'm always right . You should know that . Right for me . I will not forget you said that . Let 's hope I don 't need this . Now all I 've got to do is find that village . Seize the moment ! Live for the day ! Is that not the way love should be ? I thought you said that love should last forever ! Well so it shall . No one will come between us ! Wait here . I have a surprise for you . A surprise ? Come in . Where 's the surprise ? Oh , you 'll see it in a minute . Let 's drink to the sunny days ahead . Aah ! Go ahead . Throw caution to the wind ! Now come here and sit on the bed ... right where I can watch you when I play . Oh , such beautiful music . Genius tainted by insanity . I will spare you no mercy if you have harmed her in any way ! I could listen to you play forever . And so you shall . When I first looked upon her face , it was like ... I was looking at an angel . So innocent so pure . I don 't understand . Her name was Julia Gesch . - Ah , she looked like you . - What ? I loved her as no man has ever loved a woman . I turned my back on fame and fortune , shunned all humanity , even the light of day for her ! I have to go ! No ! - Let me out of here ! - No , no , no ! I can 't ! I can 't ! - Now you are mine ! - No ! Yes , yes . You belong to me . These must be the clothes of the poor girl 's father . All right ! Your wine was laced with hemlock . The same poison she drank to end her life . Now you will stay with me forever . I love you more than life itself . What have you done ? She 's not your daughter anymore . Oh , you 're mad . You 've gone completely insane . You can 't save her ! You can 't take her away from me ! Veronica ! Veronica ? Veronica ? Not yet . Come on , now , now drink this . Drink ! Come on ! That is , just a little more . Good , come on now . Oh come on drink , come on , now . Challenger ? Where are we ? Back where you belong . - Where is he ? - He 's gone . You 're safe now . In your arms , not his . Oh , it 's all right . It 's all right . Do you remember what you said to me back in that village ? Um-hmm . About you being right for me . Yes ! I was delirious . I really didn 't know what I was saying . Oh . I didn 't think so . - Let go of me ! - Veronica ! - It 's all right . - Oh , I just had the most horrible dream . Not a dream . It really happened . Are you sure ? German village , crazed musician we were all there . You saved me . Oh , it wasn 't all bad from what I hear ... being adored , idolised . Love is much more than that . It 's unconditional nurturing and understanding . But does it always have to hurt so much ? - No . - Oh , yes . It may not always be smooth . But it is always worth the effort . *

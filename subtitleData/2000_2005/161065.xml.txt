 The signal isn 't coming from any known frequency . Is Voice sure it 's a distress signal ? All I know is it 's coming from under the ocean . - Voice isn 't sure . - Then I say we ignore it . We can 't handle an underwater mission . - What if they need help ? - Your mission is to find the source . I signed on to fight Bailies , not run down some glitch in the communications system . Why is it so important to Voice , anyway ? I 've given you all the information I have , Hel . - Mole 's standing by . - This is the op , Sarge . Are you coming or not ? Hatch sealed . Primary propulsion system on line . Never been in a submarine before . You still haven 't . This mole is used for subterranean drilling . - Mauser jury-rigged it for underwater use . - But it 's safe , right ? Right ? Launch in ten seconds . I cant contact you in the water - Use the mole 's ultralow frequency transceiver . - Got it , Voice . Launch in three ... two ... one ! This is amazing . Tapped onto the beacon . - Should be just ahead . - What do you think it is ? Hey , while I was frozen , did they ever discover Atlantis ? What 's that ? We 've lost our thrusters . We 're on auxiliary power . It 's some kind of underwater shock wave . - It 's a directed concussion weapon . - Whose weapon ? ! Can we make it back to the launch port ? I 'd say no . I 'm blowing ballast . No , wait . We 've got to go deeper . Deeper ? ! - Are you crazy ? - They 'd be crazier to follow us . Sarge , we 're passing crush depth . Argh ! Guys , I think we sprung a leak ! Then do something to stop it . - Pull up . - Not yet . - Give me the controls . - No . You 're gonna get us all killed . 500 years finto the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth We 've lost ' em . Blow ballast . We 're not going up ! We 've taken on too much water . Would now be a bad time to mention that I 'm just a teensy-weensy bit ... claustrophobic ? Hull pressure 's increasing . Cleo , see what you can do about that leak . Good thinking . Crap ! We 're going down . Guys ? - Pumps aren 't working . - Pressure 's too great . - Is this deep enough for you ? - Oh , sarcasm in a crisis , that 's great . Um ... er ... guys , you really should see this . See what ? We 've got power back to thrusters . We 're levelling off . I don 't know what you did , Cleo , but you saved us . As much as I crave your approval , it wasn 't me . There ... there was a man outside . In the water . He must have fixed the sub . That 's impossible . The pressure 's too great . It would crush a human . I am telling you there is someone outside . And he was kind of cute , too . Hang on , Sarge . We 're caught in a current . - Can 't break free . - This is strange . It 's focused only on us . It 's working like some underwater tractor beam . Yeah , but where 's it pulling us to ? I 'm thinking maybe there . Next stop ... Atlantis . Incredible . Chill . We want to start off on the right foot . Greetings , Atlantians . We come in pea ... .. ce . OK . Take it from here , guys . Remove your weapons . - Why did you attack us ? - Remove your weapons or we 'll remove them . Well ... you just made my day . At ease , brother . Like our new friend said , let 's start this off on the right foot . That 's him . That 's Aquaman . - Shh . - Told you he 's cute . My name is Granger . Welcome . That 's a hell of a welcome . You nearly sank us . Trespassers are treated accordingly . We only meant to dissuade you from coming any closer . When you got in trouble , I rushed out to help you . He did . Aquaman . Our technicians will make any repairs to your craft , but in the meantime , I will have to ask you to surrender your weapons . I guess you find it easier to be friends when your guests are defenceless . Please . Or my brother here will insist that you leave immediately , with or without your submarine . Hel ... Do it . Thank you . We followed a distress beacon here . Do you know anything about that ? No . In fact , we try to keep a low profile down here . Perhaps our communication equipment is malfunctioning . I 'll look into it right away . Friendlyfolks . - Were not used to visitors . But your world is so peaceful . So beautiful . I should think they 'd want to show it off It 's only through our total isolation we 've been able to keep it this peaceful . How can you swim outside ? Why doesn 't the pressure kill you ? Over time and with a bit of genetic manipulation , we 've adapted to our environment . CLEOPATRA : Wow ! - Five centuries is a long time to stay cooped up inside . You 've been down here completely cut off for 500 years ? Mm-hm . Our ancestors formed an environmental movement in the late 20th century . They rejected the industrialisation that was ravaging the surface of the planet . They started with one small undersea lab , dedicated to keeping the oceans from suffering the same fate as the surface . Eventually it grew into all that you see . Your quarters are this way . Now , please , make yourselves comfortable . Voice ? Can you hear me ? Nothing . We have to contact Mauser . I 'll see if I can get the transceiver on the sub . I think you 've done enough for today . Is that supposed to mean something ? Cards on the table ? That stunt you pulled today nearly got us killed . Funny . The way I see it , I saved our hides . You got lucky . The point is , we 're a team . - And you 're the team leader ? - That 's right . - You don 't make a call like that on your own . - Oh , like you giving up our gauntlets ? Mommy , Daddy , please don 't fight . Guys ... we 're thousands of feet under the ocean , we have no weapons and a busted sub ... Maybe this little power struggle should wait till we get back to the lab . OK , so what about this distress call ? Nobody hears from these guys in 500 years , then all of a sudden their cover gets blown by a comm malfunction ? I don 't buy it . Neither do I , but let 's go easy here . We 've gotten a taste of their weaponry . They can make powerful allies if we can enlist their help against the Bailies . They may have really advanced technology , but ... I don 't know about this whole retro-marine motif they 've got going on . WOMAN 'S I need your help , sweetie . What did you guys call me ? What ? We didn 't say anything . Yeah ... Weird . Just ... hearing voices . Are you sure about this ? - What if they find out we 're planning ... - Don 't worry , brother . Everything 's going according to plan , isn 't it ? Then enjoy yourself . Let 's see what we can learn from our new friends . Don 't get too friendly . They already know too much about us . Well , it 's your job to make sure they don 't learn any more . Someday we wish to return to the surface . To create a world up there as perfect as you have down here . Sounds to me ... like the Bailies have already done that for you . What good is a perfect world if you 're not allowed to live in it ? And what kind of world would you make if you got the surface back ? The same world you created underground ? Anarchy . Level after level of petty fiefdoms sustained by greed and violence . At least we try to exist as a people . To change what we can . We didn 't just stick our heads in the sea and wish it all away . WOMAN 'S Sweetle Try a sea slug . They 're much tastier than they look . WOMAN 'S Have something to eat , sweetie . Cleo ? Cleo , are you all right ? Have a Rice Krispie treat , dear . Mom ! They 're your favourites . How did I get here ? I need your help . They 're hurting me . Please make them stop . Who ... Who 's hurting you ? I 'm close by , sweetie . You just have to find me . Mom , who 's hurting you ? Stop that ! Hey , Cleo , can you hear me ? Mom ? Cleo , it 's Hel . You 're OK . I was back home ... and my mom was there . She could be having difficulty adjusting to the pressure . Then why aren 't we all affected by that ? I wasn 't hallucinating . I felt her . She said someone was hurting her . I 'll have one of our doctors check on her right away . Am I going crazy ? How can my mom be talking to me ? She 's been gone for 500 years . You 're not crazy . There 's something going on here they 're not telling us about . - We don 't know that . - Hel ... they made us give up our gauntlets . They 're probably lying to us about the distress call . And they could be doing this to Cleo . Let 's find our gauntlets and get out of here . And I still think that there 's just too much at stake to start shooting . What if Granger has technology - that can help us defeat the Bailies ? - I don 't trust Granger . I 'm going to go find the sub and get a message out to Mauser . Could you do me a favour ? Take it easy . You know , don 't kill anybody . Hey ... are you gonna be all right ? I think so . - OK . - Where are you going ? Sarge is right about one thing . It 's time we got some straight answers . Must have been the sea slugs . Why are you keeping us here ? I 'm not . You know , I was hoping to forge an alliance between your people and mine . A lie is a bad way to start . My people don 't want an alliance . Not with you , not with anyone . This colony was founded by people who 'd given up on the human race . After a while , they began to think they were the human race . - No-one outside the city mattered any more . - Is that how you feel ? Why do you think I saved your submarine ? We can 't live this way for ever . Shut off from the world , caring only about ourselves . So you 'll join us ? I don 't know if I can . A few of us feel the way I do . But most are like my brother . They 'll do anything to keep their paradise from being discovered . I was hoping , once they met you , saw what other people were like , they 'd change their minds . That distress signal we heard ? You sent it , didn 't you ? Listen ... I don 't know what you heard ... .. but I 'm glad you 're the one that heard it . MOM : Sweetle Sweetle Mom ? Mom ? Help me , sweetie . Mom , where are you ? Hi . I think I got turned around in here . Do you think you could show me to the moon pool ? Come to Mama . Cleo ? Cleo ! Mom ? MOM : You 're close , sweetie . I can feel you . Mom , where are you ? Cleo ! - Hey . - Hey . Where did you get those ? Don 't worry . I didn 't kill anybody . Yet . Mom ? MOM : I 'm here . - Where ? Mom ? Cleo ? Cleo , what are you doing here ? My mom 's here . What ? Where ? I never met Cleo 's mom , but I 'm guessing she 's not a Bailey . You found me , sweetie . Cleo ! Next week : 114 Hel And High Water part 2

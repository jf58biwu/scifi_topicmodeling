 Strange , there seem to be no animals around at all . Strange or just bad luck . It looks like jerked Iguanodon for dinner again . Ahh ! life is tough . What I wouldn 't give for a medium rare beef steak . French truffles for desert and ... uh , well , someone to share it with . Well don 't look at me . I wasn 't . We both know you have no desire to dine in ... the fine bistros of Paris . You 're happy here . Very happy . You must dream of sharing a plate of ... raptor ribs with some lucky guy . No one I 'm telling you about . No one you 're telling me about or just plain no one ? I 'm going to go collect some papaya . At least we can bring home something fresh for tonight . Anything to change the subject . Steady . Malone ? - What was it ? - I don 't know . It was some kind of animal . - Did it get you ? - It 's just a scratch ... . but I 'm sure I hit it . Over there . - Ah ! - God ! Danu ? Is that you ? At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World The yarrow should stop the bleeding . And the aloe will help it heal , I taught you that . Here , use my shirt . I feel like such a fool . I 'm sure you 're not the only one . I 'm so sorry Danu . I was attacked by an animal . - I thought I shot straight at it . - You did , I was just standing behind it . What kind of an animal was it ? It 's uh , it 's a savage beast that hunts at night . I 've been following it for days . Alone ? My tribe 's afraid . You know me , always looking for new adventures . How long have you two known each other ? Since we were children . Danu 's people are nomadic . They know more about the plateau than anyone I know . - How 's that scratch ? - It 's just fine . - I must get back and see them . - Oh , no ! you can catch up to them in a couple of days . Right now you 're coming back to the treehouse with us . All right . I 'm going to get some more yarrow leaves . She 's amazing , isn 't she ? Yes she is . You 've done a remarkable job Veronica . Yes . Veronica says you know the plateau very well . Yes , my tribe often followed the migrating herds . We 've traveled far . Well , this animal you 're following where does it come from ? The beast ? It comes from a place where the clouds are so thick ... the sun never shines . We call it the Valley of Shadows . It sounds like a pretty grim place . I guess we 'll be sticking close to home for awhile . Thanks to you . How could I not come and warn you . We made a pact , remember ? Danu ... - it was a long time ago . - It was forever . - Do tell . - We made a pact in blood ... and we promised each other that one day ... we 'd be married . Veronica why didn 't you tell us this ? You getting all this for your journals Malone ... huh ? - What ? - You with us ? Oh yeah , every word . - Roxton ? - Danu . He must have heard something . - We 'd better go see if we can help . - What 's going on ? What 's all the noise ? It 's Danu he 's in trouble . He 's out there alone ? Only until we get there to help him . - Where 's Malone ? - He was pretty sick ... when we went to bed . Oh he 's got a hell of a fever . Those must have become infected . You 'd better stay with him . First sign of trouble , start shooting . Danu ? Where are you ? Danu ? Can you hear us ? Oh look at this , looks like a scuffle to me . Branches all broken down , dirt kicked all over the place . He must have run into the beast . With claws like this he wouldn 't stand much of a chance . I 'm sure he got away . Danu ? Why didn 't he wait for us ? He 's obviously leading the beast away from the treehouse . He 's been tracking him for days . He knows what he 's doing . He 's hiding somewhere or running for his life . Unless the beast carried him off or ... Or what ? or what Roxton ? He 's alive . I know he is . Yes , and he knows what he 's doing . He 'll find his way back to us . We 'll pick up the trail again at first light . Look Veronica , like you say , he 's trying to protect us . He wants us to stay at the treehouse ... at least until first light . Maybe he 's gone back to his people . Wouldn 't he come back here first to tell us he was safe ? Malone 's fever 's worse and that scratch is definitely the cause of it . I 've given him some sage tea with lavender to bring the fever down ... but I need to know more about this beast and the diseases ... it 's carrying before I can do anything else . - Maybe you should go with Roxton and Veronica and I stay here . - No . If you find Danu Challenger knows what questions ... to ask about the beast , he 's a scientist . I agree . Look what if this animal finds Marguerite here ... by herself with Malone too sick to help her . That 's a lovely thought . Better make a decision about this , Veronica 's waiting ... and Danu 's out there all alone . Don 't worry about me . I 'll catch up on my reading . You leave the elevator up and the electric fence on . At least the beast is moving away from the treehouse . - But north toward the mountains . - And Danu 's people . - But no sign of Danu . - You both think he 's dead , - but I know he isn 't . - No , that 's not what we said . Where have the tracks gone ? They stop right here . - Well , that is strange . - What the hell does that mean ? - He can 't just disappear . - We 'd better get to Danu 's people . Maybe they can help us . Malone you all right ? Just let me know if I can get you anything . You poor thing , you 're burning up . I 'd better make some more of Challenger 's tea . Danu 's people should be here . It looks like something drove them off . Hello . Hello . We come as friends . Friends with weapons . In peace ... to save a member of your tribe . We 're looking for Danu . You have seen him ? He came to warn us about this terrible beast . But he disappeared last night . Tell your people to put down their spears . We only want to talk . - What the hell is this ? - Silver reveals the beast . What did you say ? Fire and silver are the only ways to kill the beast . They are safe . You have been in contact with Danu . You are lucky to be alive . What are you talking about ? Danu came to warn us , he saved us from the beast . No , Danu is the beast . - There must be some mistake . - No mistake , Danu hunted where it was forbidden to go ... and he was bitten by a clawed beast . Now he is one of them . He can 't be . Are you saying there are more than one of these animals ? Maybe hundreds . No one knows . They live in the Valley of the Shadows ... but Danu has escaped to hunt his own people . I don 't believe it . Danu has killed three of his own people ... before running off into the jungle . - But why would he attack his own ? - The fever , first it attacks the mind with nightmares and dark voices . Then it seems to vanish and you are healthy again ... until the beast suddenly emerges ... with a thirst of blood and a lust to kill . So the fever is an infection that 's caused by a scratch or a bite . - It lives in the blood , yes . - Malone . One of your people has been attacked ? Just a slight scratch . Infected and getting worse you said . Once the fever takes hold it cannot be stopped . In two days your friend will follow the path of Danu . And Marguerite is by herself with Malone . There is no cure . What ? You mean you haven 't found a cure yet . There has to be a cure . We have tried everything to save Danu . Now we must stop him . The Chief has taken the rest of the people to hide in the mountains ... while we wait to trap and kill him . No you can 't . There must be some way to save him . Danu 's life has already ended . What about our friend ? I can give you a powerful drug that will slow the fever ... and ease the pain for a day or so . But you must kill him before the beast appears . The only way to find a cure for this affliction is to trap ... or kill one of these beasts and analyze its blood . Can 't we just take a sample from Malone and analyze that ? Malone won 't have full antibodies until the disease has run its course , by then it will be too late . What about Danu ? Can 't we get a blood sample from him ? If we can find him but we don 't have much time . This will give you time to say goodbye to your friend . Thank you but we are not ready to give up on him just yet . If you do not end his torment he will kill you all . I 'm going to the Valley of Shadows . I 'm going to find a cure for this disease . You will only die for your efforts . What about Marguerite ? We have to go back to the treehouse first . We don 't have time , we 've only got two days . I 'll take this back to Malone . Marguerite and I will put him in a cage if we have to . One of my warriors will escort you to your home . To you , I can only offer weapons . We have our guns thanks and plenty of bullets . Are they made of silver ? Take our spears . We have more . God speed and be careful . - We won 't lose Malone . - Never . Easy Ned . We 're safe in here . Get off of me , leave me alone . Not tonight . We 'll talk again tomorrow . Damn it Malone ! Stop it ! You 'll thank me later I promise . Just make it through the night , that 's all I ask . Oh God . Sorry to be a stickler for the rules , but visiting hours are over . Thank you ! At least the electric fence is still working . Just another night at the opera . Room service in this place stinks . Malone ? What ? You could barely ... Where is everybody ? Everybody left Marguerite here all alone ... to take care of things , you being one of them . - Are you sure you 're all right ? - Why , don 't I look it ? I can 't remember the last time I had such a great night sleep . That would be Challenger 's medicine . I 'm starving . Why don 't I go do some hunting and fishing and cook us up a great meal . Because the beast that attacked you might still be out there . All the better , for roasting . You just sit down and relax . It 's the least I could do after all your ... care and consideration last night . Except for the tying me up bit . Well no one 's ever complained about that before . Maybe we should try it again sometime when I 'm not sleepy . Why do they choose to live in a dark valley where the sun never shines ? Good question . Danu never said . Perhaps they 're sensitive to sunlight . You know what all this sounds like , don 't you ? Werewolves ... there are stories dating back almost five thousand years ... to the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh . Perhaps like any number of legends we 've encountered on ... the plateau this one resonates true as well . Why haven 't these creatures overrun the plateau by now ? Danu ! - where have you been ? - Don 't be afraid . The Witch Doctor told us everything . Don 't believe her lies . She attacked me just as she attacked your friend . Come with me Veronica . No . I don 't believe you . You 're coming with me Veronica . No , I 'm going back to the treehouse to help Malone . - With this ? - No ! - Stay away from me Danu . - You 're mine , Veronica . I won 't let you go . This must be the place . We should be there by nightfall . It looks dark enough already . Where are they ? I 'm sure they 'll be back soon . In the meantime perhaps you 'd like to join me for this ... modest feast I 've prepared . It smells delicious . That looks like Trout Almandine . Tomatoes Provencal . Malone where 'd you learn to cook like that ? Just a few recipes I picked up in France . - Wine ? - Yeah , I could use a glass or two . Unfortunately our stocks are a little bit depleted but ah ... this one has a nice bouquet . - What shall we drink to ? - How about a toast to us . Us ? It 's difficult with Roxton around but ... by now you must know how I really feel about you . Me and you ? I 've been saving myself for a moment just like this . How can I resist you now . - Take it easy Romeo . - That would make you Juliet . This has something to do with those scratches on your neck , doesn 't it ? You never did fully recover . Nonsense ! - Malone . - I 'm better than ever . I 'm the new improved Malone . Good doggie . Malone , it 's me . I 'm the one who took care of you , nursed you back to health . What kind of gratitude is this ? Oh you 're really starting to annoy me . Oh . How am I going to explain this one to Veronica ? Mmm you 're close . Malone ? Are you out here ? Anyone ? Oh fine , it 's not like I can 't take care of a simple man by myself . Even if he does have more hair , and teeth . and bad manners than usual . Who 's next ? The height of the mountains all around us combined with ... the low altitude of this place ... must create an atmospheric barrier that traps the clouds overhead . Thanks for the weather report George ... any ideas about the inhabitants ? They 're not very bold ... especially considering this is their neck of the woods . Maybe it 's these silver spears that are keeping them at bay . If they really work . Well now 's a fine time to start having doubts . I 'm just glad I brought along good old faithful . - That was a bloody werewolf . - Is that what they look like . The sooner we get a blood sample and get out of this ... godforsaken place the happier I 'll be . The Witch Doctor was right about the bullets . Let 's hope she 's right about these spears as well . Back me up . I guess we 're using the spears . That way . Where are you driving me to ? We 're creatures of the night , Veronica . - The Valley of the Shadows . - Yes . - Let me go Danu . - You won 't need this . You 're mine Veronica . We made a pact . I made a pact with Danu not you . When the moon rises , you 'll see the animal that lives within ... and we will be together . I get the feeling our hairy friends are massing . All right , first clear shot I get I 'll use this Pray that I don 't miss . Pray ? I 'm a man of science , Roxton . I 'm banking on your skill and accuracy . Easy now fellas , we only want one of you . What now ? Make a run for it . The witch doctor said only silver and fire will kill these beasts . Maybe it 's time to light a torch . Challenger , over there ! Better still , a place to hide . How far back do you think it goes ? Well , it 's hard to tell . - No don 't light that . - You just told me to light one . Firedamp ! It 's a highly explosive form of methane gas . It seems to be seeping up through the floor . Any more contradictory suggestions ? We seem to be safe for the time being . Let 's see how far this goes . Maybe we can find a place where we can trap one of these creatures . If you ask me we 're trapped already . Oh ! What is it ? We appear to have found their dormitory . Malone ? Is that you ? Get away from him ! Go on ! Get out of here ! You want more ? Come on ? And don 't come back ! You 're hurt , let me see . Malone it 's me . You just saved me . Malone , don 't do this . Challenger can help you . Malone ! Come back ! We have to kill it as quickly and quietly as possible . Is one jar of blood going to be enough . More than enough . Well , go on . Oh boy , maybe this wasn 't such a good idea . Damn it ! Leave the spear and run ! Lift your knees George move it ! - Challenger the rifle ! - Here ! Now might be a good time for the torch . - Now that should keep them busy . - And bring the others running . At least we 've still got fire . We need to build a bloody big one so we can restock our arsenal . What do you have in mind , flaming arrows ? Now that 's not a bad idea . I need anything you 've got made of silver . I knew I brought you along for a reason . Malone ? Don 't be afraid of me . Forget your friend . We 'll kill him together . Go back to your valley Danu . Oh I am , I can 't wait any longer . And I 'm taking you with me . I 'd rather die right here . What about our pledge ? Together forever we said . Do you think I 'm going to spend eternity without you ? Never ! I 'm still the same inside . I love you Veronica . I love you too ... and now I 've lost you forever . Well so much for my hip flask . Just keep dipping . Here goes nothing . Roxton look at this . It 's extraordinary , a complete reversal . He 's dead . Let 's get our sample and get out of here . Malone ! I know you 're close ! I know you 're watching me . I 'm not going back to the treehouse without you ! Challenger can help you ! You know it and I know it ! Veronica ? Where 's Malone ? We heard you calling . He 's one of them . I don 't know where he is . What about Danu ? He 's dead . I killed him . - Did you get what you needed ? - Yes , right here . Malone , don 't give up ! We 're not going to give up on you . If that 's you Malone , you had better be civil . Marguerite ? You still up there ? No thanks to you . Damn ! No luck again ? No luck , no time , and no more ideas . Silver in any concentration reverses the process but it kills the victim . I need an agent that will allow the silver to do part of ... its job and block the other part . - Where do we look ? - Oh , I don 't know . I 've tried salts , acids , other minerals ... well maybe a combination . Pass me that bottle over there . This could take months . Well that would be unfortunate for Malone . No , not the silver nitrate . Silver nitrate ? You 're a bloody genius Roxton . Oh is that right ? Oh yeah . There is an old myth that says werewolves can 't be photographed . Maybe it 's the silver nitrate in the photographic ... process that stops the image from developing . He tried to attack you ? After he turned into a werewolf ... I threw him out . He saved my life . Sounds like he might have changed his mind . I 'll go see how the boys are doing . I think it 's working . The cells are transforming ... and they 're not dying , at least not yet . How long will it take to know for sure ? More time that we 've got . Listen . No , you 've got to keep him away , I 'm not ready yet . You said it was working . Initially , but anything could happen in five minutes . Malone won 't attack us . Well you 'd better be ready if he does . I can 't inject Malone with this without more testing . - It could kill him . - If you don 't , we may have to kill him anyway . Take it easy Malone . You can only stay if you mind your manners this time . Hey it 's me you want . - Is he ? - Unconscious . Let 's do it before he shakes it off . I have no idea how much of this I should give him . - This is completely untested . - Just do it Challenger . You can 't just leave him like this . You have to , it 's his only hope . - Come on Malone . - You can do it . - Come on . - Nothing 's happening . I 'm going to have to give him the rest . He 's waking up . His pulse is racing . I don 't know if his heart can take this . It 's working . It worked . I think you did it Challenger . I owe you an apology . For what ? For teasing you about your friends . Danu was more than a friend Malone . I know that . You asked me what I dreamt about . I dreamt of Danu ... and the pact we made as children . And now we 'll never see it through . Getting over him won 't be easy . So we move on ? Just as I did when my parents left . Well we remember the good times . We 'll always have them . Come on you two , dinner 's getting cold . And this is a good part . Eating , living and laughing ... with friends who love you very much . *

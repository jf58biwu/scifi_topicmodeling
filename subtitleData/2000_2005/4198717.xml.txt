( door buzzes ) GOOD MORNING , SIMONE . Simone 's voice : Good morning , Mr. Taransky . SIMONE , A STAR IS ... DIGITIZED . DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS ? WE HAVE STEPPED INTO A NEW DIMENSION .

WHY WOULDN 'T I ? OF COURSE ... WITH HANK 'S TRAGIC PASSING , HIS SECRET DID DIE WITH HIM . THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SEARCH OF AN ARTIST . SOMEONE WITH INTEGRITY , SOMEONE WITH VISION , SOMEONE WHO CAN SEE . SEE BEYOND THIS IRRATIONAL ALLEGIANCE TO FLESH AND BLOOD . SOMEONE WHO CAN SEE THAT WITH THE RISE IN THE PRICE OF A REAL ACTOR AND THE FALL IN THE PRICE OF A FAKE , THAT THE SCALES HAVE TIPPED- - NATURALLY IN FAVOR OF THE FAKE . SOMEONE WHO CAN SEE THAT IF A PERFORMANCE IS GENUINE , IT DOESN 'T MATTER IF THE ACTOR 'S REAL OR NOT . AND WHAT 'S REAL ANYMORE ? MOST ACTORS THESE DAYS HAVE DIGITAL WORK DONE TO THEM . THERE 'S A GRAY AREA . THE ONLY REAL TRUTH IS THE WORK . I 'M GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU AFTER YOUR NEXT PICTURE . YOU 'RE SO BEAUTIFUL . YOU 'RE TOO BEAUTIFUL . WE 'RE GOING TO FIX THAT .

ANYTHING YOU CAN DO . - ANYTHING . - YEAH , LISTEN , HONEY . - WHAT IS THIS , SOME KIND OF JAMMING DEVICE ? - This is a bad place to talk . - MAYBE HE 'S JUST TALKING TO HIMSELF . - ( scoffs ) TARANSKY 'S NOT THAT GOOD AN ACTOR .

Man : Tonight , on Frank Brand Live- - since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie , " Sunrise , Sunset , " no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet , Simone- - Until now . I 'm happy to say that she 's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film . Welcome , Simone . So glad you can find time in your hectic schedule to be here . Simone : It 's my pleasure . Wonderful to be with you , Frank . No one can accuse you of being overexposed , Simone . Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight ? I guess I just think actors talk too much . Does the world really want to hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday ? Wow . She is all woman . Frank : Of course , the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more . Simone : Don 't I know it . But the only reason I 'm here now , is to put the attention back where it belongs , on Mr. Taransky 's film . And you don 't secretly want the attention ? I 'm not even sure I deserve it . You see , after tonight , I 'll have just as much screentime on your show as I have in my movies . Now , how is that healthy for a performer ? Because you have to understand , Frank , none of this is real . Who I am on screen and who I really am , they 're two totally different people . Frank : Change of topic . You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press- - Mick Jagger , Steven Hawking , Fidel Castro , most recently , Viktor Taransky . Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere ? You know , Frank , I 'd rather not discuss my private life . But Viktor and I , we are inseparable . Oh , Viktor . You dog . I wouldn 't be here today without him . ( computer beeps ) Would you like a moment , Simone ? No , I 'm okay . Okay . Then let 's talk about this work you care so much about . Sure . Where would you like to start , Frank ? - How about the nudity ? - I know where that is . Nudity 's just never been an issue for me . I KNOW THAT TREE . - Clothes are simply an option . - I KNOW THAT TREE . - I KNOW WHERE THAT IS . - What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects ? I suppose what I like most about the movies I 'm in , is that they 're not about special effects . And they are better for it , I might add . ( computer beeping ) We appear to be having some satellite difficulties . But , before we lose you completely , Simone , I just want to say thank you . Thank you , Frank . Goodbye . Ladies and gentlemen , Simone . ( sighs ) I 'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE . ON MY HONEYMOON WITH MY EX-WIFE . YEAH , LOOK . IT 'S THE EXACT SAME TREE . AND LOOK IN THE DISTANCE . THE MOUNTAIN . Milton : IT 'S A HOTEL . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . COULD THEY HAVE BUILT THAT HOTEL SINCE YESTERDAY ? GET IN THE CAR . Crowd chanting : SIMONE ! SIMONE ! ( booing ) WE DON 'T DO THE PHOTOS , YOU DON 'T GET THE COVER . IT 'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT . YES . WRITTEN ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS . DIDN 'T WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE ? YEAH , WEB SITE INTERVIEWS , NO PROBLEM . I think people are gonna love " Eternity Forever . " " Eternity Forever " is my finest work . I loved working with the director of " Eternity Forever . " He 's a genius . YOU WISH . It 's wonderful being a movie star . But there 's so many other ways I want to express myself . But it 's not enough to be a movie star . You have to be a pop star , too . If you really want to make a difference . ( gasps ) Sayer : NICE BOAT , TARANSKY ! IT 'S NOT A BOAT , IT 'S A YACHT . I KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE UP TO . YOU KNOW , I REALLY DON 'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS . I THINK YOU DO , 'CAUSE I KNOW IT 'S A FAKE . Milton : IT 'S BOGUS . YOU USED AN OLD LIBRARY SHOT FOR THE BACKGROUND . SHE NEVER WAS IN NEW MEXICO . SHE NEVER EVEN LEFT THE STUDIO . I 'VE DONE MY HOMEWORK . - I 'VE STUDIED HER . - I BET YOU HAVE . I 'VE LOOKED AT EVERY PIECE OF PUBLICITY SHE 'S DONE . AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL , THERE 'S NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE HAS EVER LEFT THE STUDIO . OH ... AND FOR SOME REASON , THIS WOMAN LEAVES NO PAPER TRAIL ? NOW , I 'VE OBTAINED A COPY OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT . I KNOW YOU HAVE POWER OF ATTORNEY , BUT SO FAR , YOU HAVE NOT TURNED OVER A SINGLE SOLITARY CENT TO THIS WOMAN . I KEEP IT IN THE TRUST . I KNOW THAT 'S WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE , BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU , EMBEZZLEMENT IS A SERIOUS MATTER . NOT TO MENTION ABDUCTION . - ABDUCTION ? - YEAH . OFF THE RECORD . I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU 'RE DOING IT . IS IT DRUGS ? IS IT MIND CONTROL ? IS IT BLACKMAIL ? IS IT ALL THREE ? WHAT DO YOU DO ? DO YOU KEEP HER LOCKED IN A BOX SOMEWHERE ? WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT YOU WANT ? I WANT TO SEE HER . UNLESS YOU SHOW ME SIMONE LIVE AND IN PERSON , I SHOW THESE PHOTOS TO THE AUTHORITIES . YOU WANT TO SEE HER ? ALL RIGHT . YOU 'VE GOT A DEAL . YOU WANT TO SEE HER ? YOU 'RE GONNA SEE HER ! GOOD ! Man : MR. TARANSKY . - HELLO , GENTLEMEN . - WE 'RE ALL READY . THIS TIME TOMORROW NIGHT , SHE 'LL BE STANDING RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF 100,000 PEOPLE . WE COULD 'VE SOLD THIS OUT 20 TIMES . YEAH , THE SOUND CHECK WENT GREAT . THE LASER SHOW IS GOOD TO GO . I GOTTA ASK YOU , THOUGH , YOU ORDERED AN AWFUL LOT OF SMOKE . WELL , THAT 'S THE WAY SHE WANTS IT . AFTER YOU TOLD US ABOUT THE DEATH THREATS , SECURITY GUARDS ARE UNDER STRICT INSTRUCTION - NEVER TO TAKE THEIR EYES OFF THE CROWD - EXCELLENT . HERE , SIMONE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THESE . - UNREAL . - AND REMEMBER- - NO CAMERAS , NO BINOCULARS . ( crowd cheering ) Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen , Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone- - live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour . LET 'S GET YOU INTO HAIR AND MAKEUP . NO .

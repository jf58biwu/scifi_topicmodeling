You might even , I don 't know , not die a virgin . Rosy ... Unless you 're allergic to that , too . Shut up . Well , don 't be so hypersensitive . Oh , that gets funnier each night . Oh , my God . World 's Number-One Dad just lost his shit . And look . I found that downstairs . is that Number-One Son ? Yeah , and ... And I took this two days ago . You see the shadow ? It moved . Oh , my God . That shadow moved ? Mm-hmm . Well , call the National Guard . Call the Space Marines . Call the cops . They love this great fake-detective routine . You 're scaring yourself because you 're bored . I 'm only looking . That picture is so blurry , it could be Bigfoot . Hey , Rose . Hey , Des . Check this out . Huh ? You got any matches ? What 's up ? - Dinnertime ! If you can stand to be away from the window long enough to eat . Hi , Ma . Oh , God . What the neighbors must think . Hey , why do you leave the lights on ? So they can see you ? Hey , Ma ... I seen Rosy with this guy , and , um ... and I think he 's a drug dealer . Rosy 's a big girl . Yeah , but don 't you think lately she 's been acting kinda off ? You didn 't like the lunch I made you . I took the pills . You can 't live on pills alone . Oh , baby . You 're so fragile . You can 't afford to skip a meal . Yeah , I wasn 't hungry . I don 't want to be made to worry about you like this . Well , I been thinking again about finding my own place . You know that 's not possible . Dr. Carson seems to think it 's a good idea . He sees you once a month . He doesn 't know how you are . I 'm 2 4 years old , Ma . I 'll take care of things . Will you finish your dinner tonight ? I can 't stay here forever . I love you . Carmen . Hi . Uh , Carmen , this is my brother . Marvin obviously knows who you are . Oh , my God . You weren 't kidding . It 's kinda pervy . You got a good eye . I got good subjects . What he 's got is a compulsion . How long have you been doing this ? 1 0 years , I guess . Yeah , since he got sick . I was one of the last kids to get Stricklers ' . You were one of those roach kids ? Well , I prefer " Bubble Boy . " Oh . Right on . What were they called ? - Judas Breed . - Right . You ever see any of them ? It didn 't work like that . Sure he did . All the time . Shut up , Rosy . He was on the phone to the CDC every week . He thought he was Smokey the Bear of giant roaches . I was 8 years old . Yeah , try 1 6 . His therapist said he felt bad 'cause they created the Judas for kids like him . Kill the roaches that are making them sick . You didn 't tell me I was on here ! - Yeah , um ... Did you want them back ? I mean , do you want them ? No. I mean , why would I want pictures of myself ? Can I have this one , though ? Yeah , sure . - May I look ? - Yeah , just a sec .

No kidding . Garbageman 's down there . Can you get me more film ? I 'm busy . Aah ! Holy shit ! What ? He 's hurt . I think there 's blood . Where is he ? - Where ? - He 's right there . Shit ! Jesus , what happened ? I don 't know . Well , what did you see ? Mom ? Hmm ? Mom ! Huh ? We have to call the cops . - Hi . - Detective Dumars . Well , thanks for coming . No problem . Simone . Do I know you ? Do you want to come in ? Yeah . What seems to be the problem ? Well ... my kids think they saw something . - Somebody was hurt . - Killed . Oh , um , my son is a Stricklers ' disease survivor . He 's environmentally hypersensitive . Oh . Must be very hard on you . Yeah , it happened over there , near the entrance of the alley . His name 's Desmond . Mm-hmm . He was covered in blood , and then he disappeared . He was hurt ? Yeah . Was , uh ... anybody else around ? He saw the Garbageman . I think I did . Okay . Okay , I bite . Who 's the Garbageman ? Him . You took these pictures ? - lt 's his hobby . - Yeah . I 'm not sure it 's legal . Oh ... He 's harmless . This guy was at the scene when - - what 's his name ? - Desmond . - When Desmond disappeared ? Yeah , and there was blood . The rain washed it away . Get any pictures of that ? No , I was out of film . Yeah , well ... Gee , I wonder what Desmond does for a living . Rosy ! Well , I , um ... might as well go have a chat with the Garbageman . I don 't see him . The guy 's harmless . ROS Y : Well , who is he ? He didn 't see anything happen . - Did you get his name ? - Never mind his name . What about the garbage bags ? Why does he come out at night ? Maybe he collects food for the shelters . What do you mean , maybe ? Did you talk to him ? Marvin . Oh , I brought two glasses . No , my shift ends in 20 minutes . is there a Mr. Montrose I should be getting a statement from ? - Yeah . - No . Cancer . I 'm so sorry to hear that . What about Desmond ? Your friend , right ? Listen , I don 't know what to do , considering . Considering what ? Marvin 's past . That 's where we first met . The precinct . I took your statement the last time Marvin witnessed a crime . Oh , right . I 'm surprised you remembered . That must be three years ago . You didn 't even talk - - Easy , Marvin . Maybe you need to spend a little less time peeping . Okay , look , we both saw Desmond get killed . Rosy ! Please . No , no , no . She seems certain . Are you ? And what about you ? What did you see ? It looked like something happened . It looked like something happened ? Are you 100 % sure , Marvin ? You saw a murder ? I don 't know . It doesn 't sound like trouble to me , but ... I can check in on you from time to time . Could you do that ... Detective ? Yeah . Sure . I can put some of my guys on patrol . Keep an eye on the ' hood . And ... call me Gary . DUMARS : No , no , no , it 's not a problem . No ? No , are you kidding ? - Oh , stop . Rosy , hey . Hey , fink . Hey , Carmen . Hi . You okay ? I saw you outside . I 'm fine . is this the thing about Rosy 's dealer ? He 's not my dealer . Rosy was telling me about this garbage guy . I 've seen him around . What 's he look like ? His face ? I don 't know . It 's a face . I never really noticed . Are those the cops Dumars put downstairs ? Yeah . is he still on the couch with mom ? Yep . Are you okay ? Oh , um ... I haven 't smoked in two days . You 're a good influence on me . What the hell is he doing ? Who ? Garbageman . There 's something glowing in his apartment . Weird . Can I see ? You 're wearing perfume . Yeah . Oh , God ! I didn 't even think ! - lt 's okay . - l 'm so sorry . He might be allergic to you . - Shut up , Rosy . - Shut up , Rosy . - l 'm gonna go . - l 'm coming . - l 'm sorry . - l 'm sorry . - Okay , I 'm sorry . Come in . - Hey . - Hey . You 're alone . Yeah , Rosy 's arguing with your mom and Dumars . - Guess what . - What ? I 've given up everything . No cigarettes . No perfume . I 'm clean , harmless . You could eat off me . God , what a corncob . What 's Dumars doing now ? Trying to pork mom , accusing me of being a junkie . I want to smash him . How 's Garbage ? He doesn 't leave his apartment anymore . Just watches . Sounds familiar . Des has been gone long enough to be a missing person . CARMEN : Did you ask Officer Dumars ? Whatever . He 's got other things on his mind . Hey , can I look ? Sure . Are you okay ? Are you taking anything ? I haven 't had anything since Des has been gone . It 's part of the problem . There 's Mrs. Leibowitz . Ma Bell ? Yeah , she 's been down there for a while . I think she 's looking for Desmond . Like Rosy ? Lost a fix . Fuck off , Carmen . Or get on with fucking my brother so I can stop chaperoning you over here . Rosy ... I 'm sorry . It 's just ... I don 't know what we saw , but it looked bad . And Garbageman ... I gotta do something . You know , my dad 's the building manager . Bad idea . What idea ? It would be the easiest thing to get a key to Garbageman 's apartment . Terrible , terrible idea . And Marvin could keep watch for us . Here 's my mobile number . Haven 't you guys seen this movie ? Fucking terrible idea . What do you think ? The Pastures . Hmm ? Adam Pasture . The kid who disappeared last week . His family would have reported him missing . We could talk to them . See what they know . And it might help get Dumars to take us serious-ly . DUMARS : Come on , it 's not gonna hurt . 803 . This should be the Pastures . # Why must all the boys act so shy ? # # l have guessed the reason why # # l may be as Brown as a berry # # But that 's only secondary # # And you can 't tell the difference after dark # # Mmm , I may not be so appealing # # But I 've got that certain feeling # # And you can 't tell the difference after dark # # They say that gentlemen prefer the blond hair # # Ladies , tell me , am I out of style # # Just because I 'm slightly shady ? # # Wait until I 've won you # # And my love drops down upon you # # You can 't tell the difference after dark # # Oh , go be yourself , now # # Beat it on out there , boys # Yeah ?

He 's been hanging out in the dark lately . Jesus . What ? Garbageman . He 's in Birdman 's apartment . You sure ? He 's just standing there . Then he 's not home . Carmen ? Carmen ? Marvin , we 're inside . Carmen , there 's two of them . God , it smells like shit in here . Two of who ? - Two Garbagemen . - What ? Maybe neither of them are him . You need to get out of there . Now , just a sec . Rosy found feathers . They 're gray , like pigeons or something . I don 't think it 's him . Oh , I just figured out what was glowing . It 's his fridge . It 's padlocked . Carmen , get Rosy . Get out of there . She 's trying to find a light switch . Carmen , can you hear me ? Yes , dear , I can hear you . I know you think this is a bad idea , but ... - Rosy , no ! Carmen , get out ! Fuck . Mom . Mom ! Mom ! Rosy 's in trouble ! simone : 1 0 minutes ! Mom ! It 's serious ! DUMARS : God damn it ! DUMARS : You are way too old for this ! Just go over there ! simone : I just don 't understand . Rosy was in Garbageman 's apartment , and then he took her ! What do you mean ? Haven 't we bugged this guy enough ? Rosy could be dead right now ! - l 'm calling the cops . - l am the cops ! I mean the real cops . Rosy . She says she lives here . Yeah , we 're her parents . I 'd appreciate it if you kept an eye on her . Are you okay ? What happened , exactly ? She was in my apartment . I don 't think she stole anything . What were you doing in there ? Are you stealing ? is this about drugs ? - No . - This won 't happen again . You are not leaving till you are cleaned up . Who do you think you are ? Oh , Rosy ! Now , you are grounded . Get in your room . - Fuck off . - Get ... marvin : Rosy . - l 'm sorry . - l 'll file a report if you want . No . Thank you . Thank you . We won 't bother you again . I appreciate that . - Good night . - Night . Why didn 't he recognize you ? I thought you had a talk with him . Why do you insist on doing this to your mother ? You 're too old to ground . He couldn 't go anywhere anyway . Okay . I 'll see you in a second . Thanks . How you doing ? Good . Carmen 's place is great . Oh . You think you 'll stay long ? I don 't know . Do you think Dumars has any terminal diseases ? DUMARS : Yeah , okay , babe . I 'll talk to you soon . Yeah . Talk to you soon . Bye . Marvin . You 're in my room . Well , that was your mom . She 'll be home soon . She 's , uh ... Whoops . - Leave it . - Sorry . I said , " Leave it " ! So , Marvin ... I want us ... I want us to be friends . So what exactly is your beef ? I just don 't know what you 're doing . Well ... Well , your mom ... She 's a special lady . And she really digs me . And I think that what we 've got could really blossom . I don 't want to know what you do with my mom , just so long as you never pretend to be my dad . And stop pretending that you don 't believe me and assigning these guys to the courtyard . What ? Who 's the official-looking guy in the car ? Let me see . And there 's another one . And another one . Those aren 't my guys . I might as well be a beat cop . I don 't even have " guys . " I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I was trying to impress your mom . I don 't even have the authority to put men on patrol . Well , then who are they ? Well ... maybe I could find out . Hey , you 're home . What are you doing out here ? Oh , trying not to smoke . Because of Marvin ? That 's so sweet . Shit , it 's Garbageman . What the hell is this ? This was supposed to happen tomorrow . I 'm out of time . It 's now or never . is it stable ? If you keep it cold . I don 't like it . - Watch it ! I 'm very , very sorry . It was a mistake . - Oh . - A little mistake . I 'm very sorry . Excuse me , sir ? Sir ? Just a moment . The phone . Where 's the fucking phone ? - CARMEN : Marvin ? - Where are you ? Following Garbageman . We need your eyes . We need help . Close it . Now . OPERATOR : The customer you are trying to reach is out ... Oh , my God . Well ... fuck . What 's going on ? You 're about to get what you paid for . Rosy ... - Fuck ! Aah ! CARMEN : Oh , my God ! - No ! No ! Let me help . She won 't stop bleeding . Good . The blood draws them . No ! No ! Oh , my God ! No ! Let her out ! Hush .

Right . Then you 'll be my coal miner 's canary . Put that in the fridge . Nobody does anything stupid , and nobody has to die early . We have to destroy it . Now , that qualifies as stupid . A fertile male could establish a new colony . A new outbreak . Deck chairs on the " Titanic . " That egg is one of thousands . They 're hoarding them . Waiting . We have to destroy it . We have to try to - - Hey , I will kill you . So help me God , I 'll kill you . Here . That egg equals my getaway money . As far from civilization as I can get . We 've already lost .

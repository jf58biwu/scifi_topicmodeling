 Mr. Taransky ... ? She 's ... She 's walking ? Don 't tell me She 's walking . She can 't walk . - Nicola ! - This , this ... - Not this . - Nicola ! - How was your massage ? - You 're in breach . - Cigarette . - Is this about the new pages ? Because I made the changes , all the changes you wanted . You are virtually in every scene . It is not the size of the role , Viktor . Am I , or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot ? Hmm ? It 's the biggest on earth . I swear . It 's a 50-foot Airstream . They don 't make them any longer . - Taller , Viktor . - Taller ? - Taller ! - What ? Eh . You 've insulted me for the last time . You 're right . It 's actually ... It 's actually taller . - You 're right . It 's amazing . - Coffee ! Wait a minute . The tires are over inflated . See ? It 's just this . See ? Look . Here . - The air comes right out . - This is sad . See ? It 's lower already . Nicola , I beg you . Don 't do this to me . You know , I had three other offers . I only signed on to this picture ... - Out of loyalty . - Well , then show me some . They 're going to shut me down ! It 's not working , Viktor . I mean , my God ! The scene with the thousand geese ? ! I don 't understand this film ! Nobody is going to understand this film . I already put out a press release citing creative differences . So just let it go . You went to the press ? Do we have everything ? All right . You know what ? You 're right . You are right . And when you 're right , you 're right . - Thank you . - Let me help you with these . 'Cause you oughta go . - I don 't deserve you . - Oh . This film doesn 't deserve you . It deserves much , much better than you ! Creative differences ? The difference is you 're not creative . To hell , please . Jack ? Jack , are you there ? She 's good . You can hardly tell she 's reading off a teleprompter . I 'm right here . Right beside you . Look . I 've analyzed this footage . We 've got everything we need in the can already . If I could just make the proper adjustments , we can finish this film without her . Viktor , according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today , they 'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame . They will sue , Viktor . They 're serious . So let 's recast . Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part . - It 's a remake , Hal . - That 's right . Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture . Of course she is , Viktor . No other name is going to sign on now . Who needs a name ? We 'll cast an unknown . I 'm not going to play opposite an unknown . - We can 't sell an unknown . - The numbers don 't work . If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again , we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture . No ! I will not give in to that blackmailing ... Viktor , let 's take a walk . Ridiculous performance . I told you she was bad . No , yours in there . Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself ? Difficult ? I 'm being difficult ? Yes . Mm-hmm . Elaine , do you know what these are ? Mike ' n ' Ike 's ? They 're not just any Mike ' n ' Ike 's , These are cherry Mike ' n ' Ike 's . Do you know why I , Viktor Taransky , two-time Academy Award nominated director ... Viktor , that was " Short Subject . " ... overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career , am walking around with ... look , look , look ... pockets full of these ... things ? ! I have a feeling you 're going to tell me . I 'm going to tell you why . Because Ms. Nicola Anders , supermodel with a SAG card , has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike ' n ' Ike 's be removed from her candy dish , along with strict instructions that any room she walks into must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her ... three of them opened ; that there be a personal Jacuzzi within 80 paces of her dressing room ; and that any time she travels , her nanny must fly with her first-class . So , what 's wrong with that ? Elaine , she doesn 't have children . Don 't you see ? They 're mocking us . They 're mocking ... we 're at their mercy . What happened ? I mean , we always had movie stars , but they used to be our stars , remember ? We were the ones who would tell them what to do . And we would tell them what to wear , - Who to date ... - That 's what you want ? ! When they were under contract to us , we could change their names if we wanted to . - More than once . - Viktor , do you realize you 're nostalgic for an era you weren 't even born in ? ! I do remember why I got into this business . - You seem to have forgotten . - Oh , please . Come on . New York ... Cassavetes . Remember ? - Here we go . - What were we doing ? We were trying to make something important . I don 't know . Shine a little light in that darkened cinema . It 's called a projector . Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth . I thought that 's what we were doing . I have good memories of those days , too . I do , but this isn 't about that ... or you , or me , or some high-minded ideal . This is business . - Spare me . - Look around . Who do you think pays for all of this ? This is about investment and return . I 'm not interested in investment and return ! I 'm not interested in who pays for anything ! I 'm trying to make a movie ! I 'm responsible for this , Viktor . Those days in New York ... It 's over , Viktor . You 're not renewing my contract ? How can I ? ! Your last three pictures tanked . No bankable star is going to work with you after this . I mean , if you just compromised a little . Well , it 's not every day you 're fired by the mother of your own child . You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time 's sake . And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey . - I fought for you . - Yeah , well ... I 'm sorry , Viktor . Dad ! - Sweetheart . - Hey , Dad . - How are you , honey ? - Good . I 'm sorry Mom canned you . I 'm going to finish this picture . Lainey , I 'm going to finish it . Because it 's important . I know you will , Dad . You 'reviktor Taransky . I 'm Viktor Taransky . 'Kay . Bye , Dad . - Hi , sweetheart . - Hey , Mom . Are you okay ? I 'm Viktor Taransky . Mr. Taransky ? Mr. Taransky , thank God . I 've been trying to see you . I 've been calling . Your assistant won 't put me through . I told her it was a matter of life and death . I was afraid I wasn 't going to get to you in time . Please , just ... - Keep your distance . - I did it ! I did it ! I licked skin , I licked hair , - I licked every part of her . - I 'm going to call security . I 'll call security if you don 't back off . I have her , Mr. Taransky . The answer to your pray ers . - The answer to this . - I was misquoted . I have your new leading-lady right here . In my pants . Please , sir , I don 't know you . - I don 't know where you come from ... - It 's me ! Mr. Taransky , don 't ... Don 't you recognize me ? The Future of Film Conference in San Jose . Remember that ? Hank . Hank Aleno . I was a keynote speaker . You must remember my speech . - " Who Needs humans ? " - Right . You were booed off the stage . - Whoa , that 's got to be ... - Eight years ago . And that whole time I never left my computer . U h-huh . Good for you , Hank . Well , it 's good and bad . That 's what caused this . The eye tumor . - Microwaves from the s creen . - I 'm sorry . Don 't be , because it was worth it . You have to see her . Oh , I 've seen those . - Not like this . - I 'll take care of that . Yeah , well , you 're talking about a " s yn-thespian . " - A virtual actor . - No , we call them " v ac-tors . " " Vac-tors " ? I need flesh . - Flesh is weak . - It can 't be done . It can be done . With my new computer code , it can be done . You and me ... we can do this together . I don 't know anything about computers . See , that 's why ... that 's why you 're so perfect . You have something ... - That I don 't have . - What 's that ? An eye . An eye for performance . You know the truth when you see it . I know . I mean , I 've seen your movies . I love your movies . - You love my movies ? - " Straw God . " That changed my life . You saw " Straw God " ? I have seen every frame of your work . You 're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity ... to realize my vision . You and me , art and s cience ... We 're the perfect marriage . Hank ... I 've had a rough day today . But , I tell you what , I 'll call you about this next week . - We can talk . - I won 't be here in a week . - The tumor is inoperable . - I 'll call you about it , okay ? That 's what I 'm trying to say . The tumor is inoperable . I 'll be dead . Well , I 'm already dead . Call me ! This week ! Please . What do you mean she won 't work with me ? She 's done nothing . She doesn 't have a single credit to her name . Better no credits than a Taransky credit . Art , you don 't understand . I 've mortgaged everything to finish this film . The creditors are calling me . they 're at the door for God 's sake . hello ? Damn it ! Mr. Taransky . Mr. Taransky ! - Mr. Taransky ! - No , I 'm not him ! - Mr. Taransky ! - I 'm not him ! Mr. Taransky ! Hank Aleno ! I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno . It was his last wish that you have this . What is it ? I have no idea . he wanted you to have it . Valarie ! Valarie ! Valarie ! Valarie , what are you running from ? From Valarie . Jack , are you there ? Something like this can happen and what ... was it for ? Why are we here ? Is that what you 're asking , Jack ? Why are we here ? No why ... just here . Just here . Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , I know I may be guilty of a crime , but it was committed with the purest of intentions . I wanted to send a message to the acting community who ... put themselves above the work , who put themselves above me . So , what did you guys think ? So fake . Totally artificial . Like we 're suppose to believe that was 1 9th century Lisbon . - Come on . - Guys ... Who 's looking at the sets when she 's on s creen ? Oh , yeah . There he is . That 's my dad , Viktor Taransky . - She was magnificent . - She 's absolutely unreal . Breathtaking . She wasn 't too ... cartoony , or anything ? The nun ? Or are you talking about the mother ? A star like that , who cares about the supporting cast ? Congratulations again . She 's not of thisearth . - You should bevery proud . - Oh , not of this earth . And the rest of the film , what did you think ? She 's a miracle . Where did you find her ? Well ... I saw her picture ... on the computer . A computer ? You really didn 't notice anything unusual about her ? Only her brilliance . To be honest , with what you had to work with , I was expecting a train wreck . - You really pulled it off . - I did ? Yeah . I have a feeling Mom 's going to take you back after this . Back on the lot . That 's what ... I know . I know . Come on , let 's go . A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film " Sunrise , Sunset . " But who is Simone ? We know so little about her . And why the secrecy ? All we know for sure is that she was dis covered by little-known director , Viktor Tarinsky . Taransky . Simone ! Simone ? - Good to see you , too , Elaine . - Where is she ? - She 's not here . - Why isn 't she with you ? Why ? Because she would never come to something like this . She 's intensely priv ate . Back to work , everyone . She 's not here . hey , listen . Have you read the reviews ? they 're love letters . Listen to this one . Oh , here . Simone has thevoice of a young Jane Fonda , the body of Sophia Loren , the grace of well , Grace Kelly ... ha-ha ... and the face ... of Audrey hepburn combined with an angel . - Almost right . - I can 't wait to meet her . Oh , I don 't know if that 's going to happen . Why not ? She is somewhat of a recluse . That 's how she stays so pure . She isolates herself in her art . Viktor , it 's my studio . Elaine , it 's my actor . There are other studios . There 's only one Simone . Okay , have it your way , Viktor . hello , Walter . Nobody came in or went out , - Just like you said . - Very good . - Mr. Taransky ? - Yes ? Is Ms. Simone coming in today ? She 's already here . She arrived before you got here . She 's going to leave long after you 're gone . Remember , under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission , understood ? Yes , sir . Mr. Taransky ? What if it catches on fire ? Let it burn . Good morning , Simone . Good morning , Mr. Taransky . Simone , a star is ... digitized . Do you know what this means ? We have stepped into a new dimension . Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it . I am the death of real . ... death of real . ... death of real . Too much Meryl Streep . A little less Streep . And a little more ... Bacall . Is this better , Mr. Taransky ? Much . While we 're at it , there 's a little something I want to add to your repertoire . You 've got the wrong Holly Golightly . Remember that thing Audrey hepburn does in " Breakfast at Tiffany 's " ? How do I look ? Give me Audrey . How do I look ? Perfect . Perfect , Simone . Perfect . Oh , God . I 'm so relaxed around you . I 'm so myself . You did create me . I just brought someone else 's dream to life . Mr. Taransky , we both know I was nothing without you . I was computer code . I was ones and zeros . I was nothing . Well ... that 's true . I don 't want to boast , but ... Are you ever going to tell the truth about me , Mr. Taransky ? I 'm going tell the truth about you . Why wouldn 't i ? Of course ... with Hank 's tragic passing , his secret did die with him . This is a classic case of technology in search of an artist . Someone with integrity , someone with vision , someone who can see . See beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood . Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake , that the s cales have tipped ... naturally in favor of the fake . Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine , it doesn 't matter if the actor 's real or not . And what 's real anymore ? Most actors these days have digital work done to them . It 's a gray area . The only real truth is the work . I 'm going to tell the truth about you after your next picture . You 're so beautiful . You 're too beautiful . We 're going to fix that . Is this on ? I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone . I do , however , have a statement to read on her behalf . " To Whom it May Concern : I 'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky 's film . At this time I will be conducting no interviews , or making publicity appearances ... - This is unbeliev able . - I politely request that the press respect my priv acy and let the work speak for itself . Yours truly , Simone . " Viktor ! Who is Simone dating ? ! Where did you find her ? - Is Simone her real name ? - Didn 't I make it clear ? No questions regarding Simone . We 're just trying to get some answers . I will make my final statement . Ms. Simone begins production on her new film today ... " Eternity Forever . " This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago . Thank you . Would you answer a question regarding Hank ? Hank ? Who asked me about Hank ? Funny , why is the movie dedicated to Hank ? Are they involved ? they were at one time inseparable . Yes . And now ? Now ... sadly to say , only in spirit . Thank you . Your car will be ready in just a minute . We gave you a complimentary car wash . - Oh , really ? - They 're cleaning the engine now . Thank you . - Viktor , hey . - Hal . I am so happy for us . The film , the chemistry . Nothing against Nicola Anders , but I think that Simone and I , we really worked great together . - You were never together . - Still , the connection was undeniable . You can 't ... Look , I have not read " Eternity Forever , " but it is fantastic . And I know I would be perfect for the part of Clive . - Clyde . - Clyde , right . That 's what I 'm talking about . Yes , perfect . Come on , man . Look , I ran into Simone on the lot . - Really ? - Yes , really . - She never mentioned it . - She 's bus y right now . People coming at her from all angles . Maybe she didn 't want you to know , huh ? I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well . - Really ? - Strongly . Excuse me . Sure . hello ? Simone , it 's so great to hear from you . How are you , sweetheart ? You 'll never guess who I 'm with . - You met him on the lot the other day . - It was more in passing . No , you 're not even close . Hal . - Hal Sinclair . - What 's wrong now ? I 'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation . No , I don 't think he put on weight . Anyway , listen . Do you think he 'd be right for " Eternity Forever " ? he 's not the right type ? You want to go in another direction ? Well ... we 'll try and talk her into it , don 't worry . Anything you can do . - Anything . - Yeah , listen , honey . What is this , some kind of jamming device ? This is a bad place to talk . Maybe he 's just talking to himself . Taransky 's not that good an actor . Honey , I know you want to do charity work . No , they 've taken special precautions . Some kind of new encryption . Why would they do that ? Well , whatever it is ... it 's dark . Dark ? Yeah . Very . All right , we 'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend . - Can you ever stop doing that ? - Why ? You 'll lose yourself in that thing . You gotta get out more . How you gonna meet boys ? Dad , I know plenty of boys . You do ? Who ? Where do you meet them ? You meet them in those chat rooms ? How do you know you 're not talking to some middle-aged freak ? Dad , I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away . It 's beautiful today . Let 's go outside and eat . And Lainey , leave the computer , please . Okay . Dad , it might be better to eat inside . Stay here . What is this ? What the hell is going on ? What are you doing here ? - You 're trespassing . - You can 't hide her forever ! Simone appears only when I want her to appear ! Sounds like a prisoner . - What are you , holding her hostage ? - You 're the hostage . I mean , you look kind of captive to me . Lainey , don 't you ever wonder where I 'm really hiding Simone ? Just as long as I know where you are , Dad . - Bye , Dad . - Bye , honey . hello , Viktor . Sorry I got her back late . Oh , no problem . hey , you want to come in ? - Hi . - Hi , Honey . - Hi , Vik . - Kent . Viktor , we simply have to dis cuss " Eternity Forever . " I still haven 't received Simone 's s cript notes . There aren 't any . If the filmmakers are happy , she 's happy . She considers herself , you know , an instrument . So she 's really going to do all this nudity ? It 's on the page . We have to do something about this budget . It 's completely unrealistic . You allowed nothing for limousine service . - She drives herself . - U h-huh . - Hair and make-up ? - Does her own . - Theater training . - Oh , she was in the theater ? Where ? You want her resume ? I 'll send it to you . Okay , great . Thanks . At least , Viktor , contingency for wardrobe . Anybody can go up a size . I guarantee she will not gain an ounce . She is so dis ciplined . Well , we 've gotta do something about this ... - " Stuntwoman . " - What about it ? - Well , there isn 't one . - She doesn 't need one . - Does all her own stunts . - Even the fall from the plane ? - Even the fall from the plane . - Oh . Shoot it on the last day . Listen , Viktor . I want to talk to you now , not as Elaine , Studio head , but as Elaine , ex-wife . hey , second ex-wife . Seriously . You got lucky this last time . But you need to be careful . We both know you wouldn 't be making this overblown art film if you hadn 't convinced Simone to be in it . Elaine ... talking to you now , not as Viktor , Director , but as Viktor , your first former husband , what happened to you ? Huh ? Experience , Viktor . That 's what happened to me . Yeah , I 've seen this a hundred times . - Really ? - Yeah . These young stars destroying thevery people who dis covered them . I 'm worried about you , that 's all . This woman , she controls your destiny . She doesn 't control my destiny . There 's something about her I don 't trust . hi , Jane . Thanks for taking me back , Mr. Taransky . I know that it looked like I sided with the studio , but I 've always believed in you . Honestly . Don 't worry . I understand . - Are they ... - They 're all here . Okay , thank you . hello . Viktor . I just want to say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for " Eternity Forever . " A reminder : as a condition for working on this picture , you will not be rehearsing with Simone . You will not be shooting with Simone . Actually , you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time , for any reason , whatsoever . - Works for me . - How will you shoot our love s cenes ? - Body double . - For her ? For you . Anyway , Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started . I believe she 's on the line now . Simone , are you there ? I certainly am , Mr. Taransky . So are we , Simone . Why don 't you leave me alone with my co-stars , Mr. Taransky , so we can get to know each other better ? Absolutely . I 'll be back in a minute . H i , who 's there ? Don 't be shy . Introduce yourselves . I 'm Mac . I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here . hi , Simone . I 'm Corel . hi , I 'm Claris . You used to date my cousin , Dell . I 'm hewlitt . We can rehearse in priv ate if you like . My name is Lotus . God , I can 't believe I 'm talking to you . We are going to become such great friends . hi , Simone , it 's Hal . It 's great to be working together ... again . Is that everyone ? Well , ob viously , as you know , I 'm Simone . Who else ? I just want to start by apologizing for my process . I know it 's an unusual way to work , but I just find I relate better to people when they 're not actually there . Oh , of course . Of course . I don 't have much to say , Except , that I know it 's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky 's vision . Always do what Mr. Taransky says . If in doub t , do it the Taransky way . I know we 're gonna make a wonderful movie together . Together . Absolutely . Veronica . What you don 't understand , Clyde , is that love ... Still too big . I like it , but it 's too big . All right . Smaller teardrops this time . What you don 't understand , Clyde , is that love is like a wildflower . But that flower only grows on the edge ... of a very high cliff . Perfect . Perfect . Simone . Simone . Simone . Gonna be a little change in plans , Simone . You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people . We can 't stop now . These films , they 're speaking to the human condition . We 're changing lives . People need to believe you 're real . To reveal the truth now , it would be too cruel . You 're gonna get in a lot of trouble , Mr. Taransky . Now , why do you have to bring that up ? ! I mean , everything 's a risk . But it 's worth it , isn 't it ? We 've done enough work today . You 've been cooped up in there too long . So how about ... you and I going out on the town ? Tonight , they 're going to see you with their own eyes . Excuse me . I will be checking in a very special guest . - A Ms. Enomis . - Ah , Ms. Enomis . Now , Ms. Enomis demands her priv acy . So , you will switch off all surveillance cameras . I alone , will es cort Ms. Enomis to her room via the rear exit . She must not be disturbed at any time , for any reason whatsoever . I 'm sure I can rely on your dis cretion . U nderstood , sir . Thank you . There she is ! Who is it ? It 's Simone . Okay , I think everybody 's here . Now ! I think we 're all right now . Oh , thank God for you , Faith . Thank God for you . This is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in . I must tell you , you have no idea the service you 've performed for Simone , shielding her from these animals . Oh , no , Mr. Taransky . Thank God for you . - For me ? - Yeah . How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress ? It 's incredible . You know , we 're gonna have to go back to my place , just to , you know , keep them off the s cent . Of course . You look so ... So much like ... um , like her ? Oh , yes , of course . Like her . But you 're so very beautiful in your own right . I do find myself strangely attracted to you , Mr. Taransky . Call meviktor . Viktor . - Oh . - Oh , Viktor . - Viktor . - Yes ? - This is so exciting . - Yes . Do what you do to Simone ? What ? What did you say ? I said do whatever you do to Simone . What I do to Simone ? Call me Simone ! Simone ? Yes . Say it again , please . I want to know what it 's like to be her just for one night . Please , call me Simone . You 're with me so you can be close to her ? Is that a problem ? Okay . Excuse me just a minute . Is something wrong ? Well , actually , maybe we can do this some other time - Or something . - Are you bus y tomorrow ? Gentlemen , the Presidential Suite . Ahem ... I think that should take care of everything . Yes , sir . I believe it will . Leave me for a moment . Simone . - Brilliant . - Elaine ! - There she is . - The picture ... The picture . It 's a revelation . Thank you . Thank you . We all worked so hard . - It was you . - No , it was all of us . It was incredible . Thank you all . Thank you . - Whoa ! - Viktor ! - Is she here ? - Viktor , is she here ? Oh , I 'm fine , Hal . How are you ? Somebody said she was here . Jesus . That 's her glass . Jack Daniels , straight up . - My kind of woman . - Come on , where is she ? I don 't know . She 's , uh ... Is that her by the fountain ? You know , between you and me , - She doesn 't really exist . - Simone ! - Simone ! - Simone 's here ? - Why didn 't anybody tell me ? - She 's here ? ! - Simone ! - I got your glass ! I 'm your biggest fan ! Simone ! - Simone ! - Simone ? Get out ! Not you two . She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don 't get an interview , a comment ? We don 't even get a photograph ? ! Is that what you 're telling me ? Nobody got a photograph . Nobody ever gets a photograph . We have our best people on it , Mr. Sayer . Get better people ! What about the 2 4-hour tail on Taransky ? they 're camped out every place he goes ; every concierge , every maitre d ' , they 're all on the take . But this Simone woman is good . Ob viously , that is not her real name . She uses an assumed identity . She travels under a false name . She checks into a hotel under an alias . Never stays in the same place two nights in a row . What about the satellite photos ? What happened ? - Nothin ' . - Nothing from space ? ! What about the fingerprints ? What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite ? Well , we have some of Taransky 's fingerprints , a lot of yours ... and none of hers . No one is that perfect , that pure . You know , I had something on Mother Teresa once . But then she died and it just wasn 't worth it anymore . I know how to flush out this Simone woman . A tell-all story from her childhood . You have one ? I will when you 're finished writing it . Please don 't make me do this . Guard , open this door right now . Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions never to open up this door . - What are you doing ? ! - Mr. Taransky ! - Why did you do this ? ! - We have to talk to her ! - We know she 's in there . - Okay . What is this about ? We 've got the tracking numbers for " Eternity Forever . " they 're in the toilet . She 's gotta get out there and sell the film . What do you want her to do , go door-to-door ? even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive ! It is precisely because she doesn 't crave the limelight that people love her ! - This is bullshit ! - She is about the work , - And only the work ! - This is overshadowing the work . If you can 't handle her , I will . It 's not a good time . She 's emotional . Today , her mother dies . Scene 4 2 of " Good for Nothing . " - This is not a good time . - It never is . - Step aside ! - We 're going in ! - This is ridiculous ! - No ! No ! - What are you doing ? ! - Simone ! I trusted you . - Simone ? - You can come out , it 's Elaine ! - We just want to have a meeting . - We can talk , - Girl-to-girl . Just us . - Where is she ? - She 's gone . - Where are the sets ? - God , that is so like her . - Where are the cameras ? Viktor , we 're not paying for this are we ? What is all this ? What is all this ? Well ... I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later . I guess I 'm actually relieved in a way . I can just say it finally . She 's a computer ... addict . What ? She 's a computer addict ! She 's buried in here . Day in , day out . Of course . I should have guessed . It 's why she never goes anywhere , - Why she 's never seen in public . - Now you 're getting it . Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms . - The one place she can be herself . - Anonymous . Only it 's worse . It 's far worse . She 's extremely agoraphobic . She has a morbid fear of people , of germs , places , heights ... - Name it . - This is terrible . How is she going to plug the film ? - Yes , indeed . - She has to do publicity . Maybe I could get her to do something . Maybe a television talk show or something . Yes ! - Taped . - Make it live , please . - Live ? - Please . She 'd never go there . It would have to be remote . We can work with that . I can 't promise anything . - We understand . - Thank you , Viktor . - Thank you , Viktor . - Don 't grovel . Thank you . Give her our best . That agoraphobia ... it 's like a plague . It 's out of control in Europe . It 's so good of you to protect her like this . She wanted you ... No , no . Don 't touch that . Germs . She wanted you to have that . She was there . She was right there . Yeah . Oh , my gosh . She didn 't , by any chance , happen to mention me ? Actually , she did . She , uh ... she said that she thought you werevery beautiful . - Really ? - Yeah . Would you want to go and get something to eat , or something ? Viktor , I 'd love to , really . , but don 't you have to go talk to Simone ? If I can find her . Well . All right . Good . - Thanks , Viktor . - Thank you . I 'm gonna ... Bye . Tonight , on Frank Brand Live ... Since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie , " Sunrise , Sunset , " no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet , Simone ... until now . she 's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film . Welcome , Simone . So glad you can find time in your hectic s chedule to be here . It 's my pleasure . Wonderful to be with you , Frank . No one can accuse you of being overexposed , Simone . Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight ? I guess I just think actors talk too much . Does the world really want to hear my life story just be cause I have a movie opening on Friday ? Wow . She is all woman . Of course , the problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract even more . Don 't I know it . But the only reason I 'm here now , is to put the attention back where it belongs , on Mr. Taransky 's film . And you don 't secretly want the attention ? I 'm not even sure I deserve it . You see , after tonight , I 'll have just as much s creen time on your show as I have in my movies . Now , how is that healthy for a performer ? Because you have to understand , Frank , none of this is real . Who I am on s creen and who I really am , they 're two totally different people . Change of topic . You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press ... Mick Jagger , Steven Hawking , Fidel Castro , most recently , Viktor Taransky . Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere ? You know , Frank , I 'd rather not dis cuss my priv ate life . But Viktor and I , we are inseparable . Oh , Viktor . You dog . I wouldn 't be here today without him . Would you like a moment , Simone ? No , I 'm okay . Okay . Then let 's talk about this work you care so much about . Sure . Where would you like to start , Frank ? - How about the nudity ? - I know where that is . Nudity 's just never been an issue for me . I know that tree . - Clothes are simply an option . - I know that tree . I know where that is . What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects ? I suppose what I like most about the movies I 'm in is that they 're not about special effects . And they are better for it , I might add . We appear to be having some satellite difficulties . But , before we lose you completely , Simone , I just want to say thank you . Thank you , Frank . Goodbye . Ladies and gentlemen , Simone . I 've been here before . On my honeymoon with my ex-wife . Yeah , look . It 's the exact same tree . And look in the distance . The mountain . It 's a hotel . I don 't understand . Could they have built that hotel sincey esterday ? Get in the car . Simone ! Simone ! We don 't do the photos , you don 't get the cover . It 's as simple as that . Yes . Written answers to written questions . Didn 't we have this conversation before ? Yeah , web site interviews , no problem . I think people are gonna love " Eternity Forever . " " Eternity Forever " is my finest work . I loved working with the director of " Eternity Forever . " he 's a genius . You wish . It 's wonderful being a movie star . But there 's so many other ways I want to express myself . But it 's not enough to be a movie star . You have to be a pop star , too . If you really want to make a difference . Nice boat , Taransky ! It 's not a boat , it 's a yacht . I know what you 're up to . You know , I really don 't have time for this . I think you do , 'cause I know it 's a fake . It 's bogus . You used an old library shot for the background . She never was in New Mexico . She never even left the studio . I 've done my homework . - I 've studied her . - I bet you have . I 've looked at every piece of publicity she 's done . And as far as I can tell , there 's no evidence that she hasever left the studio . Oh ... And for some reason , this woman leaves no paper trail ? Now , I 've ob tained a copy of your bank account . I know you have power of attorney , but so far , you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman . I keep it in a trust . I know that 's what you want people to believe , but I gotta tell you , embezzlement is a serious matter . Not to mention abduction . - Abduction ? - Yeah . Off the record . I want to know how you 're doing it . Is it drugs ? Is it mind control ? Is it blackmail ? Is it all three ? What do you do ? Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere ? What is it exactly that you want ? I want to see her . U nless you show me Simone live and in person , I show these photos to the authorities . You want to see her ? All right . You 've got a deal . You want to see her ? You 're gonna see her ! Good ! Mr. Taransky . - Hello , gentlemen . - We 're all ready . This time tomorrow night , she 'll be standing right here in front of 1 00,000 people . We could 've sold this out 20 times . Yeah , the sound check went great . The laser show is good to go . I gotta ask you , though , you ordered an awful lot of smoke . Well , that 's the way she wants it . After you told us about the death threats , security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd . Excellent . Here , Simone wanted you to have these . - Unreal . - And remember ... no cameras , no binoculars . Ladies and gentlemen , Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone ... live on stage for the debut concert of the Splendid Isolation tour . Let 's get you into hair and make-up . No . No . Yes . You know , it 'seasier to make 100,000 believe than just one ? And now , the one , the only , Simone ! I love you ... LA . It 's great to be here . # Looking out # # On the morning rain # # I used to feel so inspired # # And when I knew I had to face another day # # Lord , it made me feel so tired # # Before the day I met you # # Life was so unkind # # But you 're the ke y to my peace of mind # # ' Cause you make me feel # # You make me feel # # You make me feel like a natural woman # # Oh , baby # # What you 've done to me # # Done to me # # You make me feel so good inside # # Good inside # # And I just wanna be # # Wanna be # # Close to you , you make me feel so alive # # ' Cause you make me feel # # You make me feel # # You make me feel like a natural woman # # You make me feel # - # You make me feel # - # You make me feel # # You make me feel # # You make me feel like a real ... # # You make me feel # # Feel like a ... # # You make me feel like a real ... # Thank you . Never stop believing . Yeah ! Simone ! # What you 've done to me # # Natural woman . # I said I didn 't want to be disturbed ! Viktor . My two favorite girls in all the world . We just stopped by to congratulate Simone . Well , you know ... she 's lying down . She 'sexhausted . Yeah , I can imagine . Listen , thank Simone for the tickets , okay ? That 's a good color on you . It was a great show , Dad . I can 't believe she 's doing this . Taking adv antage of him this way . - It 's cruel . - Why ? Obviously , this can 't last . She 's gonna dump him . Viktor won 't be able to take that , he 's too sensitive . This 'll destroy him . Elaine , do you realize that you can 't stop talking aboutviktor ? I have to talk to her . I 've been meaning to talk to you . I 'm starting to feel like I don 'texist . Dad ? Oh , hi , baby . Thank you . So how 's your love life ? I do okay . What about you ? Well , you know me . Married to my work . I noticed . You know I don 't like to get between you and mom , but she 's feeling down right now . She broke up with Kent . She thinks you 're with Simone . Ah , lainey . That 's so ridiculous . I don 't have a relationship with Simone . I know , I know , but Mom doesn 't . Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out . Dinner maybe . Dinner ? I don 't know about dinner . That 'd be difficult , I think . - Maybe a phone call ? - It 's too impersonal . The y have to meet face-to-face . Well , I 'll think of something . Thees calating violence , tragic loss of human life , and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Os car nominations . - Hello ? - Hello ? - Is thiselaine ? - Who 's this ? - Oh my God . Is that you , Simone ? - Yes . - You look beautiful today . - Thanks , I ... - Where are you ? - I 'm right here . Beside you . - Oh ! - I borrowed Viktor 's car . - Hi ! - Hi . I 'm really late . I would love to talk to you , But I 'm on my way to see Viktor right now . Simone , I know what 's going on between you two . Oh ? No . Oh , elaine , there 's absolutely nothing . It 's strictly a working relationship . I just don 't want to see Viktor get hurt . Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him . Well , we have a daughter together . I don 't love Viktor . I could never love anyone . I 'm in love with the camera . Simone , I reognize the coat you 're wearing . I gave it to Viktor on his birthday . Christ . Elaine , I just ... Whoa . God ! Oh my God ! I tell ya . - Are you all right ? - This does look awful . I know that . But , Viktor , he 's just so crazy about you . Could you go to the Os cars with him ? No , no , no . If you won 't do it for him , I ask you , please , do it for me . Okay . Okay . For you . For you I 'll go . Thank you . Well , here 's myexit . All right . I 'm glad that we talked . - Oh , yes . Bye . - Bye ! Goodbye . Oh ! And , the winner of Best Actress ... is ... Oh , my goodness . We have a tie . The winners are Simone for " Sunrise , Sunset " ... Thank you . ... and Simone for " Eternity Forever . " unfortunately , Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern tehnology , she joins us live from her Goodwill Tour of the third world . Ladies and gentlemen , Simone ! Thank you . Oh , thank you . This means so much to me . I 'm just sorry I couldn 't be there with you . First , I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees . I don 'teven feel I belong in the Best Actress category , let alone with these wonderful human beings . And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio , of course . And as always , I dedicate this to Hank , without whom none of this would be possible . I love you , Hank , wherever you are . Thank you . Who 's Hank ? Her agent ? - Her father . - Oh . Why didn 't she thank you ? She did . Didn 't she ? No . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . Why didn 't I say it ? How could I forget to say it ? I wrote it . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . Excuse me , Mr. Taransky , Are you ready for your casting session ? Nicola is here for the role of Simone 's sister . Viktor . So much has happened since we last saweach other . Oh , yeah . Yeah . - Why don 't you sit ? - Thank you . I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened on " Sunrise . " Oh , that 's okay . I know . I understand . When I saw what Simone did with the role , I mean , I fired all my people . I went into rehab . I took some acting classes . I changed my whole look . She really , really inspired me . Would you like me to read ? Oh , sure . That would be good . Who do you think you are , Carlos , coming in here like this ? My husband 's sleeping in the next room . You think I won 't call out ? Do you think I 'll just ... give in to you without a fight , like I did the last time and the time before that ? I wish you were dead . I wish we were both dead . Oh ... that was just wonderful . Wonderful acting . Thank you . You could play the lead . Isn 't that Simone 's part ? Of course . Of course it is . You have such a beautiful line , right , right there . It 's not a wrinkle , or anything , it 's like a dimple . Right ... when you smile it ... I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone . Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me ? Oh , yeah . That would be crazy . That would be crazy . Yes ... that would be nuts . Would you like me to try something different with this , or do it again ? No , it 's fine . Okay . Thank you . Thank you , Viktor . Happy birthday , lainey . What do you think ? It 's fantastic . It 's what she drove in " Eternity Forever . " - I know . - See ? - You have to thank her for me . - It 's from both of us . You know , you won 't be able to drive it till you get your permit , but you can take it around the lot , okay ? Here . What 's the matter ? I can 't accept it . Why ? Why , hone y ? I don 't want a car , Dad . What do you want ? I 'll give you whatever you want . The old Viktor Taransky . I can 't stand to see you like this , clinging to Simone 's coattails . It used to be all about the work and now it 's all about her . And then she 's noteven grateful enough to thank you . Oh , no , that was me . There you go again , blaming yourself . Can 't you see what she 's done to you ? She 's taken advantage . Mocking you . You deserve better than Simone . - I have to go , Dad . - Okay . Oh , sure . She comes in all the time . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . - Is she nice ? - We 've become very close . She told me she wanted to look at my s cript next week . - Jane ? - Gotta go . I 'm leavingearly . If anybody needs me , I 'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone . Elaine Christian , please . Elaine . hi . hi . I was in the neighborhood . I just thought I 'd drop by . You don 't use the front door anymore ? U h ... no . When is she coming over ? - About now . - Oh . Okay . I 'll just stay until she gets here . Well , she 's ... already here . What ? Elaine ... Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night . - I want you back , elaine . - I want you back , too . Oh , Viktor ! Wait ! Viktor ! This is crazy . Who are we kidding ? I can 't compete with Simone . - Well ... - What woman can ? I 'd rather have you than Simone . - Believe me . - Oh . That 's so sweet . No , but I can 't let you do that , make that kind of sacrifice . - No . No . - God , this is strange . You know , I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am . - But ... - You have ? Well , it goes with the territory . For some reason , I can 't betray Simone . I can 't . There 's a goodness to her , Viktor . - No , there 's nothing to her . - Oh , Viktor . You say that now , but in the morning you would go back to her . - No . No . - You would , Viktor . She 's gonna retire . She 'll never work again . Of course she will . Her public will demand it . - Not if I don 't let her . - You ? - Yeah . - How can you stop her ? I 'm gonna tell you a seret now , elaine . Simone isn 't a real person . I invented her . Every actor is an invention . - Elaine ... - Please . You 're lucky she 's loyalenough to stay with you . Maybe she 's staying out of pity . Who knows ? I mean , she certainly doesn 't need you . Listen , she 's thin air . - She 's pixels . - What ? Computer code molded by me from a mathematicalequation I inherited from a madman . How much have you had to drink ? There 's no Simone . - I 'm Simone . - You 're Simone ? ! I 've done the impossible . I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being ... a human soul . I have taken nothing , and made it something . I have breathed life into a machine . - I made a miracle . - Viktor , please stop . - Please . - I swear , elaine . As God is my judge , I swear . I made Simone . I made her . - You made Simone ? - Yes . Viktor ... she made you . You bitch . I 'll destroy you . Bravo ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Had a rough night ? Let 's see if the y still love you after this . You made me . I made you first . Well , we 're back on " Good Morning , Good Day , " and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone . Simone , before the break you were taking a rather controversial position . I just think allelementary s chools should have a firing range . How else can the children learn to defend themselves ? If there is a hole in the ozone layer , how come I can 't see it ? Immigration ? God ! Isn 't it crowdedenough ? But God created furry animals to be worn . Have youever tasted dolphin ? Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel . Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes . But look at the benefits . I mean , you don 'teat as much . And you 've got something to hold in your hand . We always knew Simone wasn 't like other celebrities . - Oh , no . - She speaks her mind . She certainly does . It 's plastic , Hank . I know that 's the way you 'd want it . She killed you , Hank . Now she 's killing me . She 's a serial killer . But I don 't know how to stop her . I mean , she 's taken on a life of her own . I can 't just come clean , you know , make some confession , beause ... I 've defrauded millions . The y 'd turn on me . I just can 't put the genie back in the bottle , beause ... if she suddenly stopped working , you know , just dropped out of sight , the y 'd never let it rest . I tried killing her career , but the y like her even more . What am I gonna do ? Not another word , Hank . You are truly a genius . Thank you , Hank . Thank you . What 's the matter , Viktor ? You look so sad . Don 't you love me anymore ? It 's over , isn 't it ? I know what you 're thinking , Simone . This is a phone y-balone y world . We 're all living one big lie . So , why shouldn 't you live , too ? You 're more authentic than all these people who worship you . And that 's the problem . You 're looking at the real fraud . I told myself this was all about the work . But if that were the truth , it wouldn 't matter to me that you get all the attention . And it does . It does . I 'm sorry , Simone . Here I was trying to convince the whole world youexisted . but what I was really trying to do was convince them that lexist . It 's not that you aren 't human . It 's that I am . I 'm sorry , Simone . It is my sad ... and solemn duty ... to announce ... the tragic passing of Simone . How did she die ? It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the third world . Did she suffer ? Mercifully , it was quick . I feel awful . It 's a great loss . You know , we 're going to have to restructure your deal . Can I see you later ? I mean , go away for the weekend ? How could you bring that up at a time like this ? One minute , Mr. Taransky . Oh my God . This has got to be a mistake . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . - You don 't understand . - Viktor ! - It 's a mistake ! - I 'll call my attorne y . Dad ! Elaine , call Bernard ! That 's why it was so light . I heard him say , " Die , bitch . I 'll destroy you . " It was so strange . He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie . He 's a sick man . He was a controlling madman . She was a prisoner . I blame myself . I wishi had done more to stop it . Forgive me , Mr. Taransky . I 'm just trying to understand here . Now , all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and internet interviews , publicity photos , snapshots from her childhood ... All fake ? H mm ? This is fake . This is fake . Fake , fake , fake , fake , fake . - All fake ? - Yes . You understand perfetly . So , I will confess to fraud but not to murder . And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions , that 's also bogus ? No . No . The fan club 's real . It 's just what the y were worshipping is a computer code . Ones and zeroes . You couldn 't have killed Simone beause there was no Simone . - Right . Exactly . - And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about , the renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead , now , perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone , is an invention himself . Oh , no . No . This whole thing is insane ! There is no Simone ! Look . Even her name is fake . It 's not Simone . It 's " Sim One " ... See ? " Simulation One " ! It 's a computer code ! You really hated her , didn 't you ? Perhaps you couldexplain this to me , Mr. Taransky . Or is this tape doctored , too ? This is footage from the marina 's closed-circuit camera on the night in question ... altered of course . Can you tell us why you 're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn 'texist ? Well , it 's not her body . It 's her body of work . Viktor , Viktor , Viktor . Viktor . I know . Look . Look . Look . Why don 't you just come clean ? H uh ? Just tell the truth , you 're gonna feel better afterwards . I 'm telling the truth , and I don 't feel so good . He y , we all know what happened . In a fit of jealous rage , you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat ... - Don 't say that . ... that she bought for you . I did ... I can prove ... I can prove it to you . Let me just take you there . I 'll take you to the spot . I can prove it . Here . Here . Come on . We can just go there , can 't we ? - Let 's just go . I 'll take you there . - Oh , Viktor . Okay , good . Thank you . Good work . Now you 'll see . What is this ? No , there 's drives and dis cs . Where are the dis cs ? You have to go back down and get them . - That 's where the y are . - We can 't go back down there . - There 's dis cs down there ! - Calm yourself ! - Please ! Just ... - Sit him down . You must go down and get the drives . He y , you see what 's down there ? Plead guilty . Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court . It 's the best deal you 're gonna get . I could get the death penalty . Yeah . Yeah . You certainly will if you go to trial . A jury , in this kind of ugly mood . You killed an icon , for God 's sake . - Bernard , listen to me ! - Viktor ! Bernard , I didn 't kill anyone . Viktor , come on , it 's in the paper . There 's no one to kill . Bernard , I 'm a filmmaker . I was trying to say something . I wanted reognition . I wanted to be appreiated . So I created her . Bernard , there 's no one to kill . Do you understand ? An insanity defense . Beautiful . Fantastic . - What are you doing ? - " I created her . " Viktor ! Jesus ! Jesus Christ , Viktor ! What am I doing ? Oh , what am I doing ? - Get me out ! - Viktor ! Get me another lawyer . I want another lawyer ! Why can 't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore , huh ? You know , I can almost forgive him for killing her . But , to deny herexistence ? I can never forgive that . Beause obviously sheexisted , right ? I know it just as surely as you 're sitting there . She was the most vital woman I ever met . So you did meet her ? Yeah , lainey , what are you getting at ? I 'm the head of a major studio . Do you think I 'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met ? No . No . I mean , really meet her . Like in the flesh . I know it 'sembarrassing to admit it , but when I think about it honestly , I haven 't . I 've never really seen Simone up close ... touched her . Been in her physical presence . Have you ? Well ... we don 't want to believe daddy beause we don 't want to believe that we were taken in too . But , lainey , there 's no evidence that Simone isn 't real . Listen to what you 're saying , Mom . I mean , is there any evidence that she is ? Do you have any idea what you 're doing ? What 's that ? One part of Dad 's story may have been true . Simone may have contracted a virus . Certain viruses can beured . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Listen to me . There 's a ps y chiatrist in Ventura , well-respeted , who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity due to the trauma of your divorce , 10 years of abjet failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child . No more . I can 't go along with this horseshit . - Come on , Viktor . - I did it . No . No . Viktor , come on . - Tell them the y can fry me . - No , Viktor , please . - I did it ! - Viktor , please . It was premeditated ! - Can you please lower your voice ? - I strangled her . I bludgeoned her ! I set her on fire and then I killed her ! - I did it ! - Excuse me . I think you better see this . Breaking news : International media star Simone is alive and well . Her studio released this footage , just minutes ago . Simone reading today 'sedition of " The LA Times . " Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary ? Details at the top of the hour . She 's indestructible . He 's coming . Viktor . Oh , Viktor . Oh , hone y . I don 't know what you did or how you did it , - But thank you . - Well , it was lainey . But don 't thank us too fast .

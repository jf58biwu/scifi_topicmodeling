 Previously on Farscape : Aeryn ... is ... with child . - Still obsessed , I see . - Did she say anything to you before she left ? - I finally figured out wormholes . - You did it ? - All that wormhole nonsense ? - Yeah . I can get you home . There she is . Pilote ... Moya looks beautifull . Aeryn ... you 've come back . I 've got heat delirium . - Who saved your life , who ? - I did . He wants asylum . No ! You 're buried . You 're dead . I gave my word ... that he would not be harmed , put your weapons down . We ask you to choose ... one spokesperson . - You mean , just pick a captain ? - Yes . So you could tell me if ... you were pregnant ? And now on Farscape ... We 're sitting at a dead stop in the middle of nothing because Crichton thinks he can smell a wormhole about to open ? Does anyone else find this vaguely preposterous ? We promised him two arns , we 'll give him two arns ... Captain . You 've had your turn and now it 's mine . Until we elect a permanent captain , I demand the same respect and obli-arg ! Why did you construct another of those hideous instruments ? My bowels make better music . Hey , how 's it comin ' ? Almost finished ... I 'm close to balancing the harmonics across the difficult sentra chords . Not you , you ripnitz . Has Crichton found any wormholes ? Wormhole in diez nueve ... - Does that nixa really ... - ... ocho ... - ... annoy you ? - ... siete ... No . ... seis cinco cuatro tres dos uno . Tear out page forty-two . - We 're ... sorry , Commander . - No , you 're not , Pilot . You and Moya hate wormholes , but thanks for ... saying so . Do you know what you did wrong ? You mean other than getting up this morning ? Have at it , Cap . Knock yourself out . You 're orders , Captain Rygel ? Have you chosen a flight vector ? Give me other microt with this miserably ... . Would you excuse us ? Can I speak to you ? Quite a few things I 'd like to say . There 's a lot of things I 'd like to hear . I 'd like to offer you a drink , but ... My quarters ? - Frell ... - Crichton ... I don 't believe it , it 's a frelling wormhole . - Look at that . - Well done , John . The frellnik actually predicted a wormhole ! You said it ! Hey ... now there 's three of us who like you . Commander ... this wormhole is a great deal larger and closer than your assurances . Back it up , Pilot . Anything you want . Excuse me , but there is a chain of command in place . Whatever , Sparky , rock on . All right , Pilot , I think that under the circumstances that yes , I agree , we should ... - You all right ? - Yeah . What hit us ? - Don 't know . - Can you move ? ! - My arm ! What happened to the stars ? Subtitles : PK SUB-66 - Budong ! It 's gotta be a budong ! - Unlikely , we 're not moving ! There 's nothing , everything 's blown . Pilot , be there ! Okay , I 've secured a patch but it won 't last long . Sikozu ? ! When I 'm done here ! Oh ! There are no stars , it 's ah ... the Flax , the wormhole got us ! - We 're gonna die ! - Hey , Captain Chaos ... . Try comms now ! Pilote ... Como estas , Hombre ? Commander , are you all right ? - A little south of that . What the hell 's goin ' on ? - Undetermined . Moya is convulsing unlike anything I have experienced before . - And therein lies our problem . - It 's not his fault , Sputnik . Yes , it 's probably yours ! " He " wasn 't the captain ! - Pilot , what did we hit ? - Nothing . - We weren 't moving at the time , were we ? - Correct . Something hit us . Well , what you frell-wit ! There aren 't any stars ! I have ... no external readings . Not a single sense neuron on Moya 's skin is transmitting . That cannot be right . - It is , you disagreeable hy ... - How can that be right , Pilot ? Something is attacking Moya across all exposed surfaces . Her skin is burning everywhere at once . Well , what do we do ? Under the circumstances ... a hull breach will go undetected . - Perimeter hull search . - Interior . - With Chiana ? - Yeah . - With you . Has anyone heard from Scorpius ? Scorpius , are you all right ? Physically , yes . However ... - I would appreciate being let out of this cell . - Absolutely not ! Grandmama ? Yo , School Lunch Lady , you there ? Great , we got an MIA . Got no time to look now . D , how about a little space walk ? Ver ... Verdure ? Verdure . Herbage flora . Herbage ... flora . Plant ! What kind of plant lives in space ? What kind of plant can grab a Leviathan ? ! I 've never seen anything like this before , have you ? D , it wasn 't that long ago I hadn 't heard of you . Looks like Glenda was right ... We got some kinda weird plant , man . Can you see any stars through its vegetation ? Nah . It 's pretty damn deep . We 're gonna take some samples . I suspect inopportune timing but I require some assistance . You 're not getting out of that cell , Scorpius . No doubt . However ... I believe the fire ... will not honor that edict . - I 'm on my way , Scorpius ! - Hey ... What ... are you doing ? Fire on a ship is our number one priority , Chiana . I just happened to get here first . He 's a prisoner . Door stays closed . Does he look like he 's trying to escape ? Out . Out ! I know you think you 're pretty smart . But we know Scorpius better than you do . He probably set that fire . Look down the passageway . If I can start fires I am most proficient at it . Frell ! There 's fires everywhere ! It 's oozing some kinda gunk , dissolving the metal . Pilot says Moya 's fluids are rushing in to protect internal organs . It 's causing ruptures everywhere . This stuff is killing my eyes ! How come it 's not killing your eyes ? - It 's like an onion . We 'll live . - We 've got to get it off Moya 's skin . - You know what ? - What ? - We 'll blast it off with Lo 'La . Hold it stead . I am trying , but it 's not responding . I need more of your DNA . You know ... I hate this ship . It 's messy . How ... bad is the situation ? - Should we tell him the truth ? - No ... Truthfully , Pilot , ah ... it 's nothing we can 't handle . We 'll get back to you later on the details . And we are off the air . Every measure I take is soon overcome by Moya 's pain . - How did you miss the plant ? - I didn 't . We assumed it was debris ... and quite far away . When the wormhole distracted us it snuck up . Why would a plant be floating so far out here ? I don 't know . We 'll worry about that later , just don 't give up . Aeryn ? If ... too much of Moya 's skin becomes irreparably damaged she will not ... recover . We 'll fix it . One last chance . You want to wait for ... What ? So Noranti can tell us how to make a great salad ? No . See plant . Kill plant . - That 's gotta be on the Luxan Coat of Arms . - I don 't suppose you have a better idea ? Nope . Well ... then hold it steady . Leak ? Scalon vapor return duct . Could linger in your bloodstream . - Never stopped you before . - Yeah , well , this time I 'm pregnant . But , before or ... or after you left Moya . Before . Does Crichton know ? Nice . What he doesn 't know ... is that it ... may not be his . Well , you-you mean the other Crichton ? Somebody ... somebody else ? Possibly . I only found out on the Command Carrier and I haven 't had it DNA tested yet . Your life is ... is so much more interesting than mine . Can I trust you ? Yeah . Don 't want you to tell John . No way . Never , never . That 's your speech . Come here . Okay ... if I have calculated the plant depth correctly ... we 'll be able to burn right through it without Moya feeling a thing . Anything from the candy kitchen ? Nothing unexpected ... The plant secretes an acid that dissolves certain types of metal , which it then ingests . The burning in your eyes is due to a waste gas . Must go a long time in between meals . No , not really . Think of your wormholes . Everytime it opens , the sudden gravitational presense ... Draws the debris towards it . Yes . I would think . She 's too smart . Okay ... I 'm initiating the firing sequence . - What is it ? - Eat ... eats ... cry tears ... cry grow ... I can 't understand ! You ready ? - What is it ? I can 't understand ! - Eat ... John ... I 'm gonna tell you something I 've never actually put into words before . I love ... shooting things . Don 't shoot the plant ! You know what ? I 'm very good at it . Crichton , D 'Argo ... hold your fire ! Stars ... Hold your fire ! Can you hear me ? I repeat , hold your fire ! See , they didn 't even feel it . Do not shoot the plant ! I repeat ... do not shoot the plant ! Well , if it was so important , she should have spoken up sooner ! I tried ... Back up . You say it 's gonna eat faster if it 's attacked . It ate its way through the pot rather than be cooked . - Wouldn 't you ? - I didn 't boil the plant , I shot it . It 's dead . Then why do my eyes still sting ? D , your eyes bugging ' you ? That 's a yes . Pilot , how 's Moya ? No change , Officer Sun . Perhaps a slight ... worsening . She cannot localize the sensations but she still feels the burning . What 's that ? Just a couple of dead roots . Doesn 't look dead to me . It has to be . I killed it . Moya 's pain is ... increasing . What is happening ? ! It 's in the frelling ship , the plant is in the frelling ship . Pilot , how far has it spread ? I can 't tell . Moya 's senses are overloaded ... it could be anywhere . We 'll get it out , Pilot . I found two of these . Is that helping you at all ? Not much . For once in my life I wish I had your inferior noses . Pip , how you doin ' in there ? I 'm-I 'm not goin ' up there again . Can-can you send Rygel next time ... okay ? I want ... I want my weapons , and I want my comm . They 're right here . - Thank you . - Yeah . What 'd you see ? What did I see ? Was a plant ... everywhere . Up one tier . Down-down two tiers ... as far as you can see-see . It 's okay ... it-it 's in my clothes . All right , calm down . It 's not gonna hurt you . It eats through metal , not flesh . - Get it out ... just , it-it itches . - Oh , all right . I 'll help you . Come on . It 's all through the ship . It 's my fault . No , no , no . We all ... signed off on the plan . It 's probably the first time that 's happened . If we screwed up , we all screwed up . Come on . Pilot ... what the yotz is wrong with the lights ? I don 't know ! Well that 's hardly good enough , is it ? Find the problem , and fix it . Chiana , put it away . It 's in the bulkhead , not frelling running around . Yeah , so far . What are you doin ' ? Just checking to see how far it 's spread . So far it 's on every frelling tier I 've looked at . You know what ? I think it 's spawning . It 's not the only one . You pregnant ? Not me . Aeryn . Aeryn is pregnant ? No . Yeah . It 's the truth . I swear . - Does John know ? - Oh yeah . But here 's one thing he doesn 't know . The nari might not be his . She concieved on Talyn . If it 's Crichton 's DNA then it 's his , it 's ... - Yeah , but it might not be John Crichton 's at all . - Well then , who 's ? Good question . Who told you this ? Rygel . You can 't tell anybody , okay ? Hey , come on , he deserves to know . Please , swear ... you won 't tell anybody . D 'Argo ... What is the matter with you ? This Leviathan is in pain ... dying . Leviathans are good . Good things shouldn 't have to die . That 's right . That 's why we have to keep working on this plant . It itches ... I can 't scratch . Bad to scratch . I might go blind . What to do ? ! All right ... All right , here 's what we do . We help ... your eye , and the Leviathan , by finding a way to kill ... the plant . How ? However we can . Maybe a poison . I-I know lots of poisons . Yes ... I 'm sure you do . All right ? Aeryn ? I 'm over here . Hey . I checked the whole lobe . There 's no , ah ... there 's no plant in Moya 's neural tissue , she 's gonna be all right . Means we can save her , right ? Yeah , but we still have other lobes to check . Right ... OK . - Oh , Chiana ... - Yeah ? About that conversation that we had before . What ? What conversation ? The one about the ... Oh , the ... Yeah ! I , ah ... I was wondering if you could do me a favor ? Sure . Could you forget that we had ... that conversation ? Sh-sure , but-but , you know-you know , you had to tell somebody so , I don 't ... Yeah , um ... now I 'm ... really regretting that I did . I may not even tell him . What ? E-Ever ? Never ? Well , I need to know whose it is first , and ... I can 't tell him that I don 't know . So ... could you just forget that it ... happened ? Sh-ure . Is that okay ? Yes , of course it is . Definitely . Thanks . I 'm ... Oh ... frell ! All right ... you got me here . What do you want ? Watch ! Back up . Back up ! Aeryn ! This way . John ... what is it ? It seems that Audry has taste . She doesn 't like Scorpius . To the right . What have you got ? Good news as well . I can 't find any traces of the plant in the neural cluster . So it likes eating metal but it doesn 't like toubray tissue . Aeryn , what the hell was that ? Are you okay ? Aeryn , talk to me . Give me a microt , Crichton . Listen , Pilot ... the neural cluster ... Pilot ? Could be his coolant rods ... could just be his personality . Let 's just hope it 's these rods . How 's the damage to Moya ? Contained to a small section of one lobe . There should not be any loss of brain function . What about the plant ? Why wasn 't there any in the neural cluster ? Because there is no metal in the toubray . But there is metal in the electrolyte regulators . And when they jammed , the synapses overloaded . I wish to assist however I can ! There is no need for these restraints . I believe you , the others don 't . It 's working ! Crichton , it 's working . Yeah , there you go . We got lucky . It 's definitely the rods . Is that all we have ? It may not be enough . I 'll see how far I can dilute them down . - John ! - Yeah ? I know Aeryn 's pregnant . Chiana told me . Chiana ? Rygel told her . So , the whole ship knows ? Well , I don 't think Moya knows . But , ah ... Go ahead . Aeryn isn 't sure if the child is John Crichton 's . The thought had crossed my mind . It doesn 't matter . So , what do you think ? I think that either way ... you 're going to get hurt . So , uh ... look after yourself . Thanks . We 're not interested in its flavor , you ... I 'm not going to insult you . No , no , no . It 's more like hindrati petal tea . Ohhh , I can feel the fungus dying as they mingle in my mouth . Concentrate ! We know it works as an aerosol , but which element ? Or , is it the compound as a whole ? That is what we have to solve . In a casserole , no . But . . if stewed properly , I believe that this plant may compliment a variety of meat dishes . You defy the whole theory of natural selection . Do I ? Listen to me ! These people are trying to save this ship , and us ! Now if their plan fails , we need to know why this works ! You are here . Why didn 't you respond ? You 're meant to be checking the circulation . You do it . Air flow is still functioning . John and Aeryn are clear to go . Let 's not spill any of this Scorpy-juice , it 's all we got . Got it . Rygel , you 're often insufferable ... But , uh it 's not your fault . I ... was captain ! Yes , you were , and , ah ... Pilot 's Pilot and Moya 's a Leviathan ... no matter what orders you give ... they 're not going to not fly into something they can 't sense . But this plant ... this fungus ! It didn 't register . Still ... I was in charge . There are so many other reasons why you should hate yourself at the moment . Like sulking ... while others are out there risking their lives . Now monitor ... the airflow . Pilot , are we gonna be okay in there ? Tiering fan filters in the atmospheric scrubber ... allows a dampening of airflow ... Yeah , it 's all very PBS , we 'll take that as an affirmative . So , you want to talk ? I appreciate you waiting for this appropriate time and place . Yeah , I got pretty good at waiting . I can 't believe this is all we have ! Sikozu and Noranti thinned it out as much as they could . All right , they 're in position . I 'll let you know when the vapor trail arrives . At the moment all there is is this hungry plant and my frelling inability to breathe ! I 'm as far away from your hamman side as I can get ... it doesn 't look good . Just hang tough , Pip . It may be a little while . Better cut that in half . Even the DRDs have given up . The fungus is everywhere . Hopefully that 'll change as soon as this Scorpy-juice evaporates into the airstream . You know , we don 't have a contingency . Ah , this will work ... unless that plant can mutate in five minutes , what could go wrong ? Damn , I did not just say that . Guys , we got a problem . The witches brew is down the drain . Aeryn , we gotta get out of here . Aeryn ! Oh , god . Does it hurt ? - Where ? - Where it 's bleeding . Crichton ? When is your fahrbot wormhole due to open again ? - Why ? - We 've drifted directly atop it 's coordinates . The captain says " abandon ship " . D 'Argo ... can your vessel pull us clear ? Give us time ? I hardly believe it 's worth the effort . This Leviathan is gone ! Lo 'La could move Moya . But is it worth the risk ? Yes ! This old demon has isolated the plant killing compound . Tell them ! Solanterum fobex . Tingles on the palate . Mildly-radioactive in quantity . So what ? We 're out of coolant rods . Don 't you people know you 're own ship ? ! We have solanterum ! Solanterum is a toxic absorbing regulator within Moya 's filter system . - Pipes of it run all the way through ... - Okay , okay , we got it already . John , how long til your wormhole ? Too far away to tell ... but it 's coming . All right , 1812 ... Even spacing , all tiers , no gaps . Cannons set to minimum . Tell all your cousins . Go do it . - You sure you want to be here ? - Yep . My skin reflects radiation . We don 't tan ... but we don 't burn either . Aeryn ? I believe I 've set a simple control sequence to fire all DRDs simultanteously . - All right , come on back . - I 'll stay and activate . Unless you 'll agree to trust Scorpius ? No ! Aeryn , one word : radiation . I can handle it . And what about the baby ? Volunteers ? Even minimal ion exposure breaks down three of my internal organs . I doubt I shall survive until I am needed . Okay ... Hey , Fluffy , captain goin ' down with the ship ? You wish ! Just don 't frell it up . So , one million SPF ... you sure this is gonna work ? Nope . But Aeryn said it would . Something about you wanting to have more babies ? Fortunate this fungus causes you so much mucus . Excellent . Just ... hold it steady , here we go . - It 's like a wind tunnel in here . - Yeah ! Can 't be helped . Filters gotta be off , and we gotta stop this fan from spinning . All right ... That 'll keep the stuff from getting sucked back in here and being cleansed . We gotta keep the mist out in the ship or we 're toast . You get to it ! That one first . Officer Sun was quite clear in her ... If this goes bad , please die first so my last moment can be joyous . Ryge ... be ready for my signal . We ignite the purple haze too soon , the radiation won 't penetrate Moya . Too late ... we 'll blast her apart . Acknowledged . It will make me stronger . Radioactive mist makes you stronger ? Perhaps ... my final moments will be joyous . It 's working ... we 're pushing Moya clear . D 'Argo ... wormhole in four three dos uno . We 're fine . Thanks for the big warning . Now get it done . As a single element ... Solanterum needs to be heated to achieve effectiveness . 1812 ... poll the brothers ! Everybody seeing ' the mist ? That 's an affirmative . The mist should be through the ship on every tier . All DRDs stand by . Rygel ... batter up ! Ah ! Wormhole ! Too close to wormhole ! Pilot , calm down . Fire the DRDs ! - Pilot ! - Rygel ! No , get away ! I 'm trying to help ! Too much chemical and the explosion will destroy us all . Crichton , do you copy ? Damn it , Aeryn . What do you want me to do ? Rygel ! Let me go ! Rygel ! Crichton ! I gotcha . I gotcha ! I 'm slipping . Help ! Rygel ! - Pull me back ! - Shut off the fans ! What fans ? ! Shut down the fans ! Shut off the fans ! Nobody told me about any fans ! Crichton ! Pull me back ! Pull me back ! - I 'm tryin ' ! - Please , please , I 'm slipping ! Oh , fan , fan ... Pip ! Just hang on ! Rygel ! SHUT THE FANS OFF ! ! I don 't know how ! Pilot , fan ... fan ... fan ... fan . Shut the damn fans off ! Quit wriggling ' ! Just hang on ! Frelling fan . YOU BASTARD ! ! How about that ? Did that do anything ? Yeah ... fans off . - It is ? ! - Yeah . We did it . I did it . Hey ... you still got you 're pants on . Well that would be a first . That 's a good look . Very funny . Very , very funny ! The voting for the captaincy is complete ... With Moya abstaining and everyone , except for Scorpius , casting a vote ... Including myself , our total comes to eight . The tally is as follows ... One vote for Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth . One vote for Officer Aeryn Sun . Astonishing as it seems ... Scorpius received one vote . One vote was cast for the the Divine Eternal . And finally ... four votes for our new and deserving captain ... Ka ' D 'Argo ! Well done . I didn 't want to tell you about the pregnancy until I was sure . Sure you were pregnant , or ... sure who the father was ? Chiana will be killed . Yeah , it 's Chiana 's fault . Why don 't you blame her ? - It 's the other Crichton 's . - There 's no distinction in my mind any more . - Okay , now you 've confused me . - All right . Military campaigns can last for many cycles . Imagine if even a portion of a female unit were pregnant . Those of us born on a Command Carrier can retain an embryonic fetus for up to seven cycles . So this could be from ... Perhaps four cycles before I met you . And only a surgeon can release the stasis so the baby can grow . And that 's why you left ? I didn 't even make it that far . Aeryn ... I figure a relationship the kind we 're not having is based on trust . I 'm so sorry . Yeah ... me too . 'Cause you don 't ... trust me . So I don 't know how to trust you . I think I 've earned your trust . I would put my life ... in your hands but not my heart . So , what 's it gonna take ? What do I have to do ? Just come back when you have your story straight .

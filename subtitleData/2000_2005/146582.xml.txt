 You have called for me , Zeus . Lang , we have some troubling business to attend to . You are the most powerful warrior under my leadership . But I altered another man before you . ; Kan Fung . He underwent the same genetic modifications as you , but unfortunately , he has escaped . Where ? I 've been tracking him through several countries . He is searching for a geneticist who can control the mutating seed I planted in him . This is a list of the scientists whom you must terminate before he can contact them . Interesting . You and Kan Fung are the greatest mercenaries ever created , but Kan Fung has decided to use his powers for the good of others . He has become a mask ed vigilante . Bring him back to me . Alive . ( SPEAKING CHINESE ) Same results again ? My God . BLACK MASK : God had nothing to do with this , Dr. Ichien . Who are you ? Ten days ago , you received a blood sample . L  s yours ? Why ? I don 't trust anyone who wears a mask , especially after this . Four geneticists killed in different countries . Why did you do it ? These scientists were killed before I even got to them . My enemies have a list of genetic engineers like you . So they are after me now ? Don 't kill me ! Where 's your car ? Behind the building . I 'll take care of them . Get out of here . Here ! Quick ! Here ! Quick ! BLACK MASK : Let him go . He doesn 't know anything . Damn you ! Don 't blame me , Kan . You killed him . If you hadn 't been here , I wouldn 't have shot him , which would have kept our overhead down . One less bullet . You 're one of us , Kan ! You can run , but you 'll always be one of us ! You 're mine ! Ungrateful shit . WOMAN : 12 . ; 12 p.m. Irradiated host cells have entered stage five mutation . 12 : 17 p.m. Introducing mutagen suppressor 154 into cell environment . 12 : 21 p.m. Structure of host cells compromised . Suppressor G-154 is a failure . ( YELLING ) What ? Parcel for Dr. Leung . I think this is for you . There 's no return address , but ... Listen ... I know you 've been working very hard lately , and ... Why don 't we go out and relax ? Le  s have lunch together . What do you say ? Come on . Make an exception . Just once ? Are you happy now ? I thought it wouldn 't happen every time , that if you were fixated on something ... Yeah , yeah . Well , now you know . Why is this blood evaporating ? L  s boiling ! Tha  s impossible . Must be some chemical reaction with the air . Phosphorus does that . Not blood . Maybe i  s not blood , then . Hey , listen , look . I 'm really sorry about all this . Think you can give me another chance ? Just a tiny little one ? On one condition . Anything . Disappear . Think you can do that ? Forever ? Just for 24 hours , so I can get some work done . Fair enough . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Marco Leung . Are you alone ? Excuse me ? Are you alone ? Ha , ha , ha . Very funny . Bye . WOMAN : The atmosphere here in B City is red hot as wrestling fans have gathered at the Dome ... MAN : Fans from all over the country have been fighting to get tick ets for what is sure to be the most sensational wrestling show of the year . ANNOUNCER . ; Good evening , B City wrestling fans ! Tonight , the Super World Championship Wrestling Federation presents Smashmouth 2002 , the greatest event of this and any millennium ! Tha  s right , wrestling fans , you are about to witness the future of pro wrestling . A new kind of warrior for a new age , faster , stronger and badder than anything you 've ever seen kick ass in this ring before . How 's my little iguana baby ? I 'm so hot I 'm on fire . Make it last long . All the hardcore fans are here to see you beat Hellraiser . I 'm going to give them all I got . Sexy . Get a room . Okay , people . Are you ready to tumble ? What kind of half-ass bullshit is that ? I 've got 25,000 people out there ! That is.0025 percent of the biggest market in the goddamn world ! Baby , tha  s better . Tha  s what I want . I want you to make them go nuts . I want the girls to whisper your names when they get laid . I want the guys to stick your names on bumper stickers all over the world . I want you to show them what wrestling is all about ! I want you to show them who you are ! Now , who are you ? Wolf . Snake . Claw . Chameleon . Iguana . Dad ! Hey , there 's my little hero . Wha  s up ? How 's it going ? I 'm okay . You okay ? L  s going to be a great show . ANNOUNCER : Iguana will have his hands full tonight with the baddest of the bad , Hellraiser , king of the dead ! Dad , are they ever going to let you be a good guy again ? Good guy ? Why would I want to be a good guy ? Good guys are boring . Do you think all those people came to see the good guy ? Uh-uh . They came to see the bad guy . They came to see me . Last ride , powerbomb ! So le  s give it up for the new golden boy of wrestling , the master of pain himself , the lguana ! Iguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Iguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Iguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Iguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! They 're calling my name ! Hey , Ross . I 've had a change of plans . I 'm going to let you win , put you over . Are you kidding ? Is this a new script from King or something ? Honestly , I have no ... Really , Ross . I 'm going to put you over . We 'll do it just like in Tokyo . You give me some heat first , and then , instead of my ... Iguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! They 're calling my name . They 're calling my name . They 're calling my name . Iguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Iguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Lguana ! Oh , my God . Did you see that ? ANNOUNCER : One of the wrestlers has gone mad and is now rampaging through the aisles . Police are already on their way . The creature is reaching the outskirts of the stadium . IGU ANA : I could never stand you guys . Mr. Martinez , could you ... Flash ! Flash ! Flash ! You want a nice close-up ? Father for lunch ... son for dinner . Leave my father alone ! Freeze ! Guns down ! Guns down ! There 's a kid up there ! ( SIRENS WAILING ) MALE NEWSCASTER : Most of the crowd has fled . The star wrestler known as lguana has seriously injured one wrestler and several bystanders . Seemingly doing the impossible , he is scaling the outside wall with his hands alone . Dan , no ! Let him go ! He 's our friend , Dan ! Want a hostage ? Take me ! Let the kid go . There are two people now at the top of the building . There are two people going to the side . One is lguana , the famous wrestler . He is fighting with another man . Who is he fighting with ? Another amazing twist in this new drama as an unknown costumed man enters the scene . MALE NEWSCASTER : - Enters to fight the monster . But who is the man behind the black mask ? Grab her ! Go ! Go ! Climb ! Climb up ! We don 't have to do this . Maybe I can help you . I ... am ... not ... a ... monster . No . No ! What was that ? Part of the show ? Who 's next ? Me ? You told us we would be able to control the change . You lied . Excuse me , boys . I swear , I didn 't ... I swear , I didn 't lie . I just told you ... What I told him to tell you . Mr. King is on a need-to-know basis , and he almost never needs to know . You have questions , come to me . You 're venting your anger at the wrong man , Chameleon . Mr. King didn 't kill lguana . The masked man did it . Dan is dead , Moloch , because of your little tricks . There was never supposed to be a full transformation . I understand how you feel , but haven 't I always told you that emotional control is what this thing is all about ? Iguana never followed my instructions . Now , he would have made a full recovery if he 'd had the chance , but the masked man took that chance away , and I promise you that we will get revenge . Now , if anyone 's scared , you can leave , no hard feelings . Mr. King would like to let you know what you 'll be missing out on , however . Yes . After tonigh  s tragedy , our insurance people were horrified , but our investors see potential ... a potential windfall , which would put another million into each of your bank accounts . What do you say ? That works for me . Is this our way out ? Le  s just hope this don 't lead to a dead end . You make me puke , King . MOLOCH : Give her time , King . RECEPTIOIST : Nurse Logan , line two . Nurse Logan , line two . Dad , watch out ! He 's behind you . Move ! Hurry ! No ! Here 's our little hero . Dr. Marco Leung ? Mm-hmm . Poor kid . Fortunately , he 'll make it . I ran some blood tests and the results were negative . As far as we can tell , there 's nothing wrong with his blood . What are you checking for ? Genetic modifications . Like the wrestler who died . Do you have a fever ? Maybe you should see a specialist . Yeah , I 'm looking for one now . Marco ? They 're waiting for us downstairs . Yes . Le  s go . I 'm just asking you to go to dinner . I 'm not asking you to sleep with me . You 're acting like you 're from the ' 90s or something . I don 't care if this is the ' 90s or post-millennium . This is not happening . CORONER : His real name is Daniel Martinez , better known as the lguana . Huge man . Well , you haven 't seen nothing yet . Hey , this is a hospital ! MALE RECEPTIONIST : Miss Jaffe to the burn ward , please . We 're only talking dinner . You know what my answer was , is and always will be . Look , I know you 've got this thing . You can 't stand being touched by men . Okay , okay , he 's dead , but ... Well , tha  s easy . All you have to do when you 're going out with me is pretend that I 'm dead . I 'm sure after five minutes of conversation with you , I wouldn 't have to pretend . We want our property back . Give it to me ! Thanks . Now I 'm going to have fun with you . Oh , my God , inspector ! They 're fighting inside . Doctor , I 'm the one who sent you the blood sample . Don 't ... No , listen to me . I need your help . Doctor ? Freeze ! Freeze ! Freeze ! NURSE : Her first patient out of medical school died while she was giving him an injection . The patient grabbed her hand and didn 't let go . Tha  s what happened . She 's got this thing about men touching her . A phobia . Therapy for six months , and still ... Questions ? No . MARCO : You should have a specialist look at that . BLACK MASK : Yeah , I 'm looking for one now . Doctor , I 'm the one who sent you the blood sample . Are you sure you got the right sample from the doctor ? Positive . This blood shows genetic abnormalities , but i  s not lguana 's blood . There 's someone else out there . Someone with more advanced technology . Someone who could be very useful to us . Why would you need anyone else ? If my animal DNA strains are injected into the bloodstream of this individual , and successfully form a hybrid , then the problems that your wrestling friends have been having can be taken care of . They 're not like you , Thorn . They need more energy to reach phase two . That is the solution . Trouble ? Don 't you ever knock ? Sorry . I said no ! No camera in my bedroom or in my bathroom ! I said no ! I know this is for my protection , but this is going way beyond my limits . I can 't concentrate ! I 'm going to go home , take a shower , and relax . Are you a fan ? RAYMOND : He 's my dad . He might be in the hospital , but he 's the greatest . Well , I think he 's pretty great too . Really ? Yeah , really . You know , good guy , bad guy . L  s just a game . Why does everyone treat us like dirt ? Are you hungry ? Are you Black Mask ? Who 's he ? He saved my life , but I never got a chance to thank him . I have a feeling I 'll run into him again . That means you 'll be in trouble again . Look , thanks for the food and everything , but I need to get back to the hospital . Okay . I 'll take you . Thanks , but we have to stop here . I have to sneak in . Well , where are you going to sleep ? Don 't worry about me . I 'll take care of myself . All right , but just in case , check your backpack . I 'm sure your dad left something for you . The Black Avenger . Why don 't you use " Black Mask " ? Tha  s what the press nicknamed him . There 's a problem . These nutball superhero wannabes , they all have hideouts , like the Mask Cave or something , so we 've got to find him . You 're not going to have any trouble finding him . He wears a mask . Who knows who Black Mask is ? We can have as many " Black Masks " as we like . The name doesn 't belong to him . He tries to use it , we got it copyrighted . We sue him . Sue him ? Then we say ours is the real thing . And if he does not win next week 's steel cage death match , then my name is not the King ! And remember , kids , we got lots of toys coming your way . We got the Black Mask car , we got the Black Mask glow-in-the-dark action figure . We got the Black Mask winter outfit ! Black Mask ! Take off the mask . Take off the mask . Tha  s what you look like ? Take off the mask ... and sign here . I seek an audience with The King . Call my secretary . Okay , what do you want ? I want to make sure I have my own personal trainer and my own dressing room . " The Black Mask , Star of the SWCW . " How 's that sound ? Huh ? What do you say ? Let me up ! Let me up ! Iguana . What did you do to him ? It was Moloch ! He used drugs ! He spliced reptile DNA with human DNA , just like the others . Others ? Chameleon , the Claw , others . The others ! Who is this Moloch ? Let me up . I 'll tell you , I swear ! Please ! Please ! Now , who is Moloch ? I don 't know ! He came to me three years ago when I was managing a women 's mud wrestling ... CHAMELEON : You 're mine . ( ROARS ) The drug 's working . Get him ! He got away . Don 't worry . He 's one of us now . Three high-speed cables for the electronic microscope . Do we have them ? Here . Area 57 , clear . ( GUNSHOTS ) Everyone , spread out ! He 's around here somewhere ! ( GASPS ) You ... doing this ! Okay , you 're seeing things again . Doctor . I need your help . This man from the wrestling federation , Moloch . The one who turned the wrestlers into hybrids . He did the same to me . I need your help to find a cure . Now more than ever . What should I do ? If you don 't respond by the count of three , we 're coming in ! One , two , three ! You okay ? Yeah . Okay , i  s okay . Le  s go . Okay , heads , I tell them , tails , I don 't . Heads . Inspector ? Yes ? Forget it . Stupid . Everyone ! Hurry ! ( SIRENS WAILING ) I changed my mind . Hey , hey ! Don 't do that ! Oh , God ! Wha  s going on ? Your clothes were torn . Bought you new ones . Did you borrow these from a close friend ? The stores around here , they ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . Forget about it . All right , then , le  s get on with it . Get ready . I ain 't right . What the hell is going on ? Damn . Oh , man . I 'm feeling ... weird . Wha  s happening ? Subject Claw . ; Terminal mutation in 46 hours , 33 minutes . Subject Wolf . ; Terminal mutation in 34 hours , 12 minutes . Subject Chameleon . ; Terminal mutation in 44 hours , 7 minutes . We 're damned . I can 't change back . You ain 't the only one . I 'm stuck with this damn Wolfman face , man . L  s going to cost these folks more than a million bucks to convince me this is cool now . Wonderful . The level of transformation is perfect . You 're a liar ! No , no , no , no , no . You gentlemen are right on schedule . We can 't change back . Wait a minute . You knew this was going to happen ? How come you can change back and we can 't ? What the hell did you do to him that you didn 't do to us ? L  s just a matter of stages . Thorn , explain it to them . He used plant DNA on me and animal DNA on you . Plants create energy , animals don 't , but he found that in an animal DNA subject , the host can supply itself with enough energy . With energy , your phase-one transformations will no longer be unstable . With the next level no longer affected by emotions , you will gain complete control . Stop with the science lesson . So how long until we reach the next stage ? To get to the next stage , you need an injection . To make the serum , I need ... iridium . I don 't have iridium , but I know a place where we could ... borrow some . ZEUS : You are an enhanced human , Kan Fung ... whose services will be sold to the most powerful corporations in the world , but if you escape from me , I will find you and destroy you . I will find you and destroy you . I think I can slow down the DNA replication , but only temporarily . I might need a radioisotope to do it , but I might not . We 'll just have to see . I don 't like feeling as if I 'm an experiment . So ... you want a sample ? What ? Oh ! Jeez ... no . You mean , right here ? Of course , right here . I didn 't think a doctor would be afraid of a little blood . Right . You 're going to have to do it yourself because I can 't touch you . You were talking about a radioisotope . Something you needed to make the cure permanent . Iridium . L  s part of my suppressor therapy experiment . L  s coming into B Harbor tonight as part of a Red Cross shipment , but it can be used in both ways , either as a suppressor or to strengthen a reaction . Oh ... Iridium . Wait ! I said I 'm not sure . The sample 's on the table . What are you guys looking at ? ( KNOCKING ) I.D. , please . I 'll get the papers . Wolf ! Papers ! Hey , what is this shit ? Oh , did I forget to sign ? ( SCREAMING ) Control , control ! ( BUZZ ) ( ROARING ) ( ELEPHANT TRUMPETS ) Oh , my God . Le  s put him in the van and finish this ourselves . He 's going nuts . He 'll get out and go right back after this elephant . Why don 't we just tie him up and put him in a bag ? Yeah , sure . You 're right . He 's coming with us . You keep an eye on him . Why me ? Because I said so ! Because I said so . Come on . Le  s go . What do you think of this one ? Not bad . A bit skinny . The one with the leather suit ... ( SCREAMING ) What is the password ? Never . L  s voice-activated , not a retinal scanner . Your eyes mean more to you than to me . Wha  s the password ? Harvest ! Enter . Harvest time . Is this it ? Yeah ! WOLF : What is it ? THORN : Hospital-grade iridium . Just what we need to straighten out that damn Snake . Where is Snake ? You think next time we can break into someplace with money ? You never know . Life is long . WOLF : Damn ! Look at that ! Tha  s gross ! I thought Wolf was watching him . Spit him out . You are so getting on my nerves , Snake . Get a hold of yourself , Wolf ! ( ALARM RINGING ) Shit ! CLAW : Le  s get this sucker , Wolfie ! THORN : Get back here ! We need the iridium ! Damn freaks ! ( SIRENS WAILING ) Don 't think we need those nets . Le  s call the cherry pickers . ( THUMP ) Come on . Get in there ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Cease fire ! Cease fire ! Hey ! Black Mask is over here ! Go get him ! Go ! Move ! Move ! Move ! This had better work . ( BREATHING ) Kan ? Is that you ? Cure ... Don 't touch me . Cure ! Cure . Now . Losing control . Mask , you are not going to die on me . Mask ? CHAMELEON : Black Mask . Just when I thought I lost you and your little doctor friend . Listen to me ! CHAMELEON : No time for that . Don 't even think about it ! Stop ! I said stop it . Get out of the way . This is between me and him . No . You did this to my dad , and I won 't let that happen again . He 's a murderer . I loved Dan . You don 't understand this feeling yet . Don 't make me fight you too . No , you don 't understand . Black Mask saved me from Iguana . Iguana was trying to kill me . You 're just like him . You 're the murderer . BLACK MASK : Do you know what was going on in his mind when he let go of my hand ? If you keep on like this , one day you won 't be able to turn back . You 'll disappear ... just fade away . Find a cure for yourself while you still have some control . Moloch won 't help you . Okay , Moloch . You kept your promise . Get some rest , boys . We 'll do some more tests tomorrow . Welcome to the next stage of evolution . Kan ! Oh , oh , sorry . What happened to you ? Well , I saw you down there , and then I tried to run down and go after you , but ... How do you feel ? Good . I feel good . And tha  s another thing I owe you . Don 't be too optimistic . Without the iridium , my suppressor can 't separate normal from abnormal DNA . You can control it , but ... There 's still an animal in me . Yeah . L  s funny the way you put it . Well , it can 't be worse than not feeling anything . I 'm not even human . Did you feel that ? No . Not exactly . Did you ? No , no . Not a thing . We should try again . No . For science ? Okay . ( DOOR OPENS ) Raymond ! Hi . What are you doing here ? Tha  s my partner . Oh , come on . Why is there always a sidekick ? And besides , he 's underage . He 's quite all right . You have called for me , Zeus ? You have called for me , Zeus ? Very observant of you , Lang . You have a chance to redeem yourself . I have located Kan Fung . Where ? These events took place in B City , in full view of the press . Interesting . What is this thing he 's fighting with ? Obviously an enhanced human . Primitive job , as you can see . I want you to find the man responsible . See if he can be bought . We don 't want amateurs interfering in our business . And if he refuses ? U se the usual method . We will leave immediately , Zeus . Lang ? Yes . Kan Fung must not get away this time . I don 't want him exposed to the public lik e this . The prodigal son must return . Do you question my orders ? No . You and Kan Fung are much alik e . You also have the seeds of betrayal in you . I swear to you , Zeus , I do not . Do not fail me . This is your last chance . At the Pranaya Military Research Centre , several grams of californium were stolen . This situation has been judged critical by several observers . They say this is an ominous sign given last nigh  s theft of iridium from a harbor warehouse , judged critical by several observers , as a simple bullet made from these unstable elements could create a nuclear explosion , and that a 30-meter symbol of the Shadow Group ... Is that a snake ? No . L  s the Greek letter " Z. " Zeta . It stands for " Zeus . " Zeus ? Who 's that ? BLACK MASK : Leader of the Shadow Group , my creators . KING : Who the hell are you ? LANG : I 'm a man who thinks you 're wasting your talents , doctor . Talent I can put to much better use . Lang and Moloch . Apocalypse meets inferno . You have in your possession a large quantity of iridium . You lack the element to do something grand with it . Californium and iridium , a biochemical catalyst and a radioactive element . Do you know where this is leading to ? They 're making a bomb . A DNA bomb . They 've got enough of that stuff to turn all of B City into a goddamn zoo . This is Lang 's style . All this just to get to me . Where are they going to do this ? If they want me , it will be the most obvious place . There . Done . Iridium and californium . Done . Iridium and californium . We 'll have a big show in the arena tonight . Genetic apocalypse , and only Black Mask to stop it . You think he 'll show ? Does the dog speak without the master 's permission ? ( GROWLING ) Will he show ? Kan , " Black Mask , " as you call him ... has very little sense of self-preservation . He 'll come because he thinks he 's needed , and when he does , I 'll take care of him . We don 't need your tricks . I hear the dog barking again , Moloch . I 'm disappointed your creatures don 't know to be quiet in the presence of their superiors . LANG : Time 's up . Live or die ? I decide who lives and dies in this lab , not you . Let him go . Now ! Life it is . Your brain is useful to me . Tha  s the only reason you 're alive . Do you understand ? TRO Y : Doctor , are you sure you can get into the system ? Every code can be broken , Troy . A protection device . Always full of surprises , Moloch . What do we do now ? Find Black Mask . Tha  s not going to be easy . REPORTER : What about reports that your fighter , Black Mask , is a dangerous man ? KING : They are absolutely true . Black Mask , known as " Blackie " to his friends , is one of the three most vicious fighters alive today , which is why tonight he will be coming face-to-face with the other two : Claw and Wolf ! I 'll murderize them ! He 's an impostor ! REPORTER : How many Black Masks are there ? There is only one Black Mask . That man is a fake ! BLACK MASK : He 's the fake . You 've been conned , so go home . There won 't be any show tonight . Take off that damn mask ! RAYMOND : Where are we going ? We 're following him . Maybe he can lead us to the bomb 's detonator . Get you , no matter how long it takes me . You did this to him ? Indeed . I got rid of the parts that were useless to me . All I needed was his brain . So , did you enjoy your energy drinks ? What was in it ? L  s a poison that accelerates your heart rate till it explodes . Poison ? You poisoned us . Black Mask is here . Enough time to get Black Mask . You do this for me , and the antidote is yours . I guess so . Le  s do it . Mask ? Where are you ? Aren 't we here to help Black Mask ? Tha  s not funny , Raymond ! Look . Where ? Up there ! Maybe we can stop that jerk ! Hurry ! Now we have to wait . MARCO : Hey , over here ! Ready for some action ? I could take you with one hand ! Now ! Got you ! Raymond ! Do something ! I was just kidding . You 're not after me , right ? You 're after Black Mask . I will terminate all those who help Black Mask . Marco ? Are you alive ? Marco ? Are you okay ? Come on , answer me ! Yes , I 'm alive ... I think . Moloch , what did you do to me ? Remember lguana . I will never disappear . You must hold on . This time , you die . Now , weren 't you supposed to bring me back alive ? I 'm tired of this . Zeus will understand . He needs me more than you . ( BEEPING ) Whatever you do , you 're still going to die . ( BEEPING ) This is the end of your journey , Dr. Lang . I have to go on with mine . Dr. Leung ! REPORTER : Dr. Marco , do you have any comments ? Hi ! Hi . This is my dad . Hi . Tell Black Mask thanks for everything . Your son was very brave . You should be proud . I am . Can you give this to him ? L  s our address . Hope he can write us back . He will . I 'll make sure of it . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Dr. Marco Leung . BLACK MASK : Are you alone ? Yes . Where are you ? You are not safe yet . I 'm not ? You 're still under my protection . Oh , I see . Isn 't this a kidnapping ? No more silly costumes this time , okay ? Hold tight . Subtitle arrangement : Plavi-G Mai 2003 01 : 37 : 06,089 - - 01 : 37 : 07,078 Subtitles by SDI Media USA

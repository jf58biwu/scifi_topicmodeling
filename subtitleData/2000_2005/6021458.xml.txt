 Previously on Farscape . I am Pathfinder Neeyala . Wormhole technology . Garnered at great cost . With potential beyond measure . Moya was sucked down a wormhole and spat out again . What happened in the middle ? We were not harmed , merely ... examined . By who ? Neeyala 's Pathfinder buddies ? I ... couldn 't say . Tres , dos , uno . I 've finally figured out wormholes . You did it ? All that wormhole nonsense we put up with . Yeah , I can get you home . If I knew where home was or where we are . And now , on Farscape . Exist ... Exist ... ence . Existence . Existence . Existen eal . Exist-en ... si ... al . How 's the English ? Oh . They start small , they grow , and then they change . I don 't know . 26 symbols . It should be easy . Well , they can barely escape their own gravity . He 's been out there a long time . Hmm ? Oh , yeah , he seems to like this particular wormhole for some reason . Hmm . He 's just learned to speak the language of wormhole . Worm-hole . Wormhole . If you wanna get him back , that 's not the language you need to learn . - John , are you there ? - We 're on secure Comms . Is there a problem ? I just caught this apothecary placing drugs in your quarters . She says they help you forget Aeryn . They just dull the pain . Do they work ? When I double the dose , yeah . D 'Argo , it ain 't none of your business , so forget about it . I could make something that will help you remember . Oh ! Soulless Luxan ! John . Oh John , you have to let her go . It 's more complicated than that . Crichton out . Ah ! How is Moya doing ? Much better now that her new filters are blocking this region 's electrostatic surges . Excellent . Next thing you have to do is get over your fear of wormholes . Defying all logic , Crichton may actually figure out how to get us away from the Peacekeepers forever . Without disrespect , he oftentimes leaps to conclusions prior to leading us ... Not here , Pilot . Trust me . I wouldn 't have risen to Dominar if I wasn 't good at recognizing things before they happen . You were deposed in a coup led by your own cousin . Hmm . Just be ready . None of them seem to take your warnings very seriously . Why should they ? They have only anecdotal evidence of what the Scarrans intend . Unlike you and I. Should I accept your proposal , to be allies , what assurances do I have that you will watch my back ? Apart from the pleasantness of the task , you instantly become the most important one to me . Most important , save Crichton . Always save Crichton . Agreed . Three , two , one ... Ain 't you a beautiful thing ? Damn , check this puppy out . Hey , Pilot , about time for that pickup , I think . John ? - Break out the docking web anytime now . Pilot ? Pilot ? Pilot ! D 'Argo , you might wanna get the ship ... Pilot ! ... ready . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Kansas , in the winter . D 'Argo . Pilot . Oh , hell , I 'm getting that " going to the Island of Misfit Toys " thing . Or just waiting on the Titanic . Well , as long as this whole deal doesn 't end up with me as an old man . Hello ! Nanook ? Beelzebub ? Yeah , let 's get it on , get it over with . Nice threads . Helps to humanize you . Makes it easier for me to sympathize with your problems . Time . Time . Zup ? Time . Flies . Time . Bandits . - Time . Wounds all heal . - Time . Rosemary and thyme ... - Time . zup . Time . Either stop pointing guns at people or get a bigger gun . Time is ... Infinite . Relative . You are quite a simple organism to possess the knowledge you do . You 're only saying that ' cause you don 't know me . Time is meaningless , and yet it is all that exists . Very Morrissey . My name is Joh ... - Yes . And yours is ... - Unimportant to our encounter . Exactly . I love how you lay it out there , Einstein . So let me ask you . Without getting existential on me , why am I ... why are we ... here ? You are present to perish . I am present to effect that outcome . Oh , my God . Day one . How y 'all doing ? My name 's John . John Cri ... Have to wait for the translator microbes , buddy . ... answer him quickly . You know how Luxans can be . - Oh , you betcha . Your ship . What kind is it ? It 's a ... four cylinder . Got a plastic Jesus on the dashboard . Whoa ! Pilot ! I demand you give me maneuverability , now ! There is nothing I can do . Not while the control collar is still in place . Hey , why don 't you try ripping out that control panel ? Moya can 't withstand this assault much longer ! Here 's Rygel ! Hey , Sparky ! They brought you on board , didn 't they ? Don 't worry , I 'll protect you . I 'll look after you now . You look after me later . No offense , Buckwheat , but you couldn 't look after a Chia Pet . Why don 't we move this along . What is the matter with you people ? ! Tongue . Thank you . Thanks for the memories . Where 's the rest of my suit ? This atmosphere will sustain you . Space and time are fused . A set of coordinates for each required to locate a specific event . Everything happens at a time , in a place . Relativity . Movement at speed through space becomes movement through time . Einstein again . 1905 . You publish anything since ? Wormholes bridge space-time , creating a unique ability to navigate . Yeah , wormholes . Been there , done that . Many times , it seems . And now , you unerringly position yourself prior to them opening . How do you possess such knowledge ? Bad luck . Really bad luck . It 's a long story . Maybe later . The unconscious knowledge we 've given you will guide you . No ! You were already on the right path . Get out of my head ! Time . Ancients ? Yeah . I never met another man who was more in touch with his own feelings . A real hell-raiser . And you couldn 't help but love him . Kind of man who would finish a game with a broken leg . Rescued me from out of nowhere and dropped me right in the middle of my dream job , working on the Farscape Project . Stephen Hawking is a genius , all right ? But John is ... more toward that end of the spectrum than the rest of us . He would share whatever he had with others . I can 't bear to be without him . Sorry . Oh , and he was so good in bed . Wormholes are the one feature that traverse both our realms , which adjoin , though never intersect . An aggressive perforation of one would allow an unacceptable incursion of material from your existence into ours . And who would wanna do that ? The biologics of your realm are infinitely more aggressive than ours . Perhaps . Why don 't we table that discussion ? Tell me about the Ancients . Members of my species , substantially modified to live in your realm . They 're here to spy on us ? Narcs ? To catalogue , report and influence . When they disappeared , we decided to investigate the state of wormhole knowledge in your realm . You hauled Moya 's ass down a wormhole . I was surprised to discover a Leviathan . The expectation was a Pathfinder vessel . I have just infused our beacon into the Leviathan superstructure . Those I questioned knew nothing of wormholes . They did , however , mention you repeatedly . He knows . Crichton knows ... Wormholes are his obsession . You set them free to find me . Your knowledge is is quiet extraordinary for one of your realm . Thanks . And your many travels inside wormholes , troubling . But now that I 've glimpsed your mind . I 'm aware this has made you a target of more aggressive species . A liability which must be dealt with . You stay the hell away from me . D 'Argo ? Pilot ? - Crichton ... - Aeryn ? Pip ... Aeryn . It 's you . Ah , what the hell 's going on here ? Frelled . Right up the ass . It 's a great plan you came up with . What about the others ? Dead . Sheyangs got ' em . We 're the only ones left . This is not funny ! We 're done here ! We 're done , all right . Everything 's gone and we 're next . Okay , if weâ   re gonna do this ... What about the Pods , my module ? Maintenance Bay . It 's , uh , it 's a furnace . Space suits ? This floor is the only one that isn 't filled with toxic dren . Oh , ho ! Oh , come on , just once . You and me , like we should have from the very beginning . Pip , knock it off . Let 's just get out of here . Come on , Crichton . We 're gonna die . I just wanna die doing something fun . Something I like . Something that makes me feel ... good . Your plan didn 't work . This is mine . No ! Spectacular . Boy , I gotta hand it to you . You give great ... great illusion . Now I know how Copperfield got Schiffer . What you experienced was real . Well , it felt real . Real . Real like the water 's not wet ? Real like you see with no eyes ? No ! Time . Wormholes . The knowledge to unravel events . For that alone , I should kill you . As a Pa 'u , I 'm generally the teacher . But with John , I ... I learned as much as I gave . Whenever he touched me , there was an almost ... electric caring . John Crichton ... made me a better captain . I sensed a , a purity of spirit . Better leader . A purity of soul . Better man . And I 'm supposed to just take your word for it . This hair could be as fake as this iceberg , this world . You . That hair represents a possible outcome , an unrealized reality . When he 'd come over , I 'd have to cover up all the mirrors , just so he 'd spend some of the time looking at me . My dad and John 's mom are brother and sister . Crichton blew a key tackle ! My three-year-old niece could 've tripped this guy up . It hurt Dad ' cause he loved family so much , but we were forbidden to hang out with John after he was about 15 . - You know why he 's dead ? Pig-headed . He actually made a couple of passes at me . We weren 't ready for a space trial , not really . Like I 'm gonna sleep with a guy who only has one graduate degree . He was a cheap date , a lousy drunk , and a redneck . If I say " blasphemous " , I don 't mean in his attitudes toward God . I mean his attitude toward life . He was lousy in the sack . Damn , I always knew Reverend Miller didn 't like me . But Caroline ? That 's ... that 's a bit of a shock . This wormhole . You lingered so long I was able to locate you . Describe this fascination . I don 't know . Something just struck me . It is part of an extensive system . One of untold number which permeate the space and time of your realm . Tell me about ... unrealized reality . Oh , no , this is that dream where I wake up in a cell , naked . Thank Heaven for simple mercies . One out of two . So you won again . Two of three . Officer Aeryn Sun . Special Peacekeeper Commando . Icarian Company , Pleisar Regiment . My name Jose Jimenez . We got a lot to catch up on . Pretty good , huh ? I learned from the best . You . Why are you out of uniform ? What is your rank and regiment ? Oh , baby , you had me at hello . Rank and regiment . Now . And how do you know my name ? What you should really ask is how I know you 've got a birthmark on the sweet spot of your hip . Every wormhole system has millions of exits , each to a distinct time and place . Travel from A to B. Now , attempt to travel back . You could arrive at point A immediately after you left , or a cycle later , or a cycle earlier , or ten or ten thousand . Millions of permutations . The secret is understanding time . Not so much understanding , as accounting for . Unskilled wanderings create unrealized realities . So what you showed me wasn 't real ? If I had not pulled you back , wherever it was you went would have become your reality from then on . Does not compute . Are you saying that there 's millions of me running around with millions of pathetic lives ? One of you , with millions of potential realities , depending on where and when you emerge from this system . If you do . Time . Going forward 's not a problem , is it ? Going backward , that screws the pooch . Should a traveler appear earlier in the timeline of his own existence , he would be but as a pebble cast upon still waters . But the ripples he creates would , over time , radiate upon far distant shores , geometrically altering events in its path . And your Ancients gave me just enough knowledge to be dangerous . Without such input , the odds of anyone else actually appearing at a destination they previously occupied is so remote as to be mathematically disharmonious . Then why am I not dead already ? I trust the one who entrusted you . But I need to understand why he bestowed this ability . Are you afraid of this knowledge ? No . There is still time . Shall we go , sir ? Mm-hmm . The Scarran spy , as you commanded . Release her . Sir ? Release her . After what happened , is that ... Are you questioning my orders ? Release the spy . Now watch ... and learn . Be cool and no one 'll get hurt . What of those already hurt ? Someone , sometime , has to end the madness . I will never tell you what you want to know . Frankly , my dear , I don 't give a damn . I 'm just trying to keep you alive . Thank you . Guards ! Stop her ! Captain , stay down ! Weak species . That wasn 't me . That 's not me . Whatever it was , would be you . Could be you . Which is why our vigilance is so high . Why the knowledge to navigate wormholes must be suppressed , and why you trouble me . You want me not to have the knowledge ? Take it out of my head . I 'm kinda surprised that worked . Sorry . This is not me , either . My ability to maintain this environment is weakening . Just take back what your Ancients put in my head . Impossible . Impractical and possibly imprudent . What do you desire with wormholes ? For starters ? To go home . Your place of origin is where you can do the most damage . Oh , God . John ! He 's never faithful to his girlfriends . Well , he made it perfectly clear that his work was a greater priority than I was . The womanizing , the drink ... Yes , I got the point . Drugs . The point . Yes . But the risk ? People you don 't recognize . A world changed irrevocably by the toss of a pebble . Well just shove me back down the wormhole . - I cannot . Why not ? You did it for Moya and Pilot . Propulsion . You are the first to be brought here without vehicle . So how the hell am I supposed to get off this rock ? Through the wormhole . With what propulsion ? The smoke you 're blowing up my ass ? You possess the knowledge ! I have little time . From the moment the Ancients implanted that knowledge , you exist to service a larger ... No . No . That 's what you want . My name is John Crichton . I 'm not your pawn . Then let us proceed . John Crichton ? Arrogant . Impulsive . Self-absorbed . Insane . - Ignorant . You tell me . The guy was an idiot . I once shared Unity with that " Uuman " , and the experience still haunts me . Don 't go any further . That is John Crichton . I 'm glad he 's dead . Why don 't you just grab anyone that goes wormholing and be done with it ? Simply the effort to encounter you was massive . We can no more function in your realm than you in ours . Which is why the Ancients were important to us . So modify more of your people and send them over . The endeavor is in hand , but requires time for metamorphosis . Have you truly chosen to help prevent aggressive species from acquiring this knowledge ? As a career ? No . We have little time . And there is much you need exposure to . What 's happening ? I must soon reenter my realm . And what happens to me ? If you have learned enough to survive , reinsertion to the wormhole . Now , pay attention and listen . Sagaciously . From every point of entry , a wormhole branches into multiple parts . The subdivision continues until ... The subdivision continues until , at length ... you 're deposited back into space-time . The journey can be random or with purpose . ... or with purpose . - Destination is the key . Every portal has a distinct space-time signature . The only destinations you can realize by design , are those of which you have foreknowledge . The more you travel the more signatures you will catalogue . Our Ancients have given you the ability to recognize these subtle differences . Since every destination is surrounded by similar unrealized realities the closer you travel the more you must maintain absolute engrossment . And never return to a familiar place prior to the last last time you left last time you left . ... prior to the last time you left . Your next journey may lead to a permanent unrealized permanent unrealized unrealized reality reality . He ... here . Hot dog ? Hurry . Hot dog ? Learn . See . Feel . Did you bring the mustard and onions ? Uh ... yeah . Glad you could make it , son . Well , I can 't stay long . I gotta get back to work . I was hoping we could have a talk . Hot dog ? Yeah . I always loved your dogs . Corn on the cob , too . Watermelon . All your favorites . So , what did you wanna talk about ? You . A talk we should 've had years ago . I don 't think I 'm still a virgin , Dad . You can 't beat this . And I hate to see you waste your energy on the impossible . Impossible 's a daily part of my life . You remember what we were like centuries before the Scarrans conquered us ? Weak genes . Disease . Death . I think our health and longevity outweigh some personal freedoms , don 't you , son ? No . You 'll never change . But you 're young . I never told you this , but when I was young , I wanted to fly , too . Space . A dream . But it wasn 't to be . And it won 't be for you , either . I can 't accept this . Any of it . I know I 'm not much of a hero to you , son . But if it means anything , I 'd still like to walk on the moon . This place disintegrates . Don 't let me go again . You gotta ... you gotta put me back in my own time , my own place . But you put me back where you found me . You can do that yourself . I don 't ... understand any of this . There 's nothing to understand . It 's not a science , John . It 's an art . You failed me in Art . Not to mention third grade English . And I still do not understand the proper use of a comma ! You did not forget the A , Johnny . You wrote a report about Mark " Twin . " You can hear me . How do I get back to Moya ? Focus on the space-time signature where you entered the wormhole . Every system is like a maze that loops back upon itself . Focus . Get back to Moya . After you have left her . Well what if I screw up ? What if I get there before ? You afraid , buddy ? Yes . No . Maybe . If you get back to ship before you left , the pebble that drops will be close to you . Ignore the ripples . Fix the first thing that goes ape . Fix the first thing . What was that about the ripples ? The elasticity of time allows for unrealized realities to remain so . If events are matched closely enough to course they have a way of restructuring themselves to familiar outcomes . If matched closely enough to course , events have a way of restructuring themselves . Harvey knew . Harvey knew . Harvey knew ! Scorpius knew . How ? I mean , I like him , but he was , uh ... Insolent . Selfish . Competitive . Obsessive . Obnoxious . Unbearable . Hey , I think we should run . You wanna to run ? Let 's run ! Chiana . Shoulda run . Chiana ! - I 'm coming . What did you find ? Just these . Barely charged . They 're gone . My love , your love . My love , your love . Our loves . Gone . Suicide . Suicide and they 're gone ! They 're trying to make peace with the Peacekeepers . What are you doing ? Plot a course . A course . A course . Yes , yes . You should eat something . Before you die . John Crichton ? Crichton . Nope . Not in the space program . Glasses ? Accountant ? See , our families were never close , so I think I only saw him once . I could look him up in the Who 's Who . Are you sure I know him ? Maybe he went to State . For every point of entry , a wormhole branches into multiple paths . The subdivision continues until at length ... The subdivision continues until ... The journey can be random or with purpose . ... you 're deposited back into space-time . Destination is the key . - Destination is the key . Destination is the key - Destination is the key . Pilot , I demand you give me Starburst now . Starburst ? Zhaan and Aeryn are out there under a flag of truce . D 'Argo 's regained consciousness . He and Crichton are eager to leave . Don 't ! Don 't ! They 're peaceful . Please . No ! Cannot leave my lady . My love , my life . Transport Pod 's loaded with supplies but there are Marauders waiting to shoot us down . We can 't escape . We 're trapped ? That 's what " We can 't escape " means . Go help Stark hyperventilate . Well if you 'd just let me negotiate ... We mean you no harm . No . Well , I could ... I could bake something . Since every destination is surrounded by similar unrealized realities . The closer you travel closer you travel the more you must maintain ... The closer you travel the more you must maintain ... the more you must maintain absolute engrossment . Pilot , where are you , you four-armed tralk ? Right now , Moya couldn 't Starburst the length or your stubby little arm . This stubby little arm is ... Is short , as is our ability to maneuver , accelerate , or defend ourselves . Why doesn 't anything work ? Because , slutty tralk , of all the half-frelled modifications for his wormhole experiments . And never we return to a familiar place prior to the last time you left . ... prior to the time prior to the last time prior to the last prior to the last time you left . Prior to the last time you left . Now just why won 't you help us , Crichton ? Because , like everybody else here , I ... don 't wanna be here anymore . You have to fix what you 've done . But . Yeah , I haven 't ... - Fix it . Can 't you see he 's distracted ? No ! Scat ! Go on ! This ... This will free you from any thoughts of your betrothed . No , no , no , honestly . She ... She 's not on my mind anymore , Grandma . So big . So beautiful . So blue . Aeryn ! - Blue ? Come back to me ! You 're very pretty . Oh ! Fix it ! Yes , fix it ! You really should have picked me over Zhaan . Absolutely , next time , when I 'm gonna move house . The dren gets worse , morons . All right , I should die at any time now . We haven 't done anything . Einstein , any time ... - Fix Starburst , you miscreant species ! No ! Crais , you yotzfotz bastard ! We had a deal ! A deal ? You tried to sell us out . You bet your fekkik , tenka head . It 's every Hynerian for himself . We 're being blasted apart ! This way . Weapon 's primed . The Peacekeepers have boarded . Oh . If company 's coming , I can bake some skrinberrry muffins . Let 's go and kill Peacekeepers . Chiana , remain at your post . - No . Starburst , rig for manual activation . - I got it . Well , that 's it . That 's it , I quit . Stay at your post , Chiana . You know , you suck worse as a captain than you did in bed . That was helpful . - Can you fix Starburst ? I don 't think so . What about your ship ? What ship ? - Lo 'La . Lo 'Laan was my wife . Are you mocking me on death 's threshold ? Never , little big man . Never . Um , excuse me , but she is having some sort of fit . She 's dying . Happens when I 'm stressed . Stark , pull yourself together . - Won 't be very ... Let me go to work , please . Send her to a better place . Oh , please , I don 't wanna die . I don 't wanna go down like that . Heal her pain . Wanna a fight , you got a fight . Do your worst . I will never be taken prisoner again . Aah ! I am bleeding . Will you look at me ? I am bleeding . I ... Calm down . They 're on board ! We give them what they want . Anything they want . Take no prisoners . They cannot die . Corporeal illusion . Return . Replenish . You ! You shoot me . Shoot now ! Coming back , Stark ? Always . No , no , no , no . What are you doing ? Giving her a second chance . Katratzi ozanatha katratzi . Execute on sight . - Yes , sir . Shoot now ! My brother 's murderer . You are dead , Crichton . Captain Crais . I am Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth . I trust our deal will be honored ... What you experienced was real ... You afraid , buddy ? Wherever it was you went will become your reality from then on . Are you afraid of this knowledge ? Well done , comrade . Well done . Your next journey may lead to a permanent to a permanent to a permanent unrealized reality . ... reality . I almost could not retrieve you . Yeah , I noticed . We 're running out of real estate . This construct disintegrates . Next time , your reality ... forever . No next time . Leave me . To die ? Why ? Too risky . All of it . Best to leave me . Are you suddenly becoming afraid ? Yes . Of the damage I can do , yes . Fear . Fear is the correct answer . Can 't do it . You 'd rather die ? Not particularly . But I liked my childhood and I don 't wanna scramble the eggs . Should aggressive species puncture the wormhole , the consequences for both our realms would be unimaginable . Ah , screw it . But I am not Kirk , Spock , Luke , Buck , Flash or Arthur frelling Dent . I am Dorothy Gale from Kansas , and you are gonna hire more Ancients . Then simply permit yourself to perish prior to reaching a destination . Moya . After . Her space-time signature will be familiar . Powerful . Moya . Fear is your providence . Feel the force . - Adjust . Maintain focus . Focus . Harmony . When this is over , you 're gonna take this crap out of my head . Someday , should you survive . After . Do you now know what it is ? Time . D 'Argo ? Pilot ? Whoops .

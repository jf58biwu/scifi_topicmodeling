 Future Shock Good thing I noticed that . Planet Express stockholders . I present our chief executive officer , Professor Hubert Farnsworth . - There he is ! - Take it off ! - Where am I ? - Move forward ! Walk into the light ! Oh , God ! I 'm dead ! Well , no matter . Thank you all for coming . I don 't recognize any of you , nor can I recall why I am here . Without further ado a film highlighting Planet Express , Inc . ' s latest fiscal year . Planet Express is on the move ! For this hip , young delivery company , tomorrow is today and today is yesterday ! You heard me . It was a year of soaring profits and significant one-time losses . Watching myself work makes me hungry . Help me find food . I 'll not only find it , I 'll help you do more to it . A Bot-Mitzvah ! Shalom , hunger . Shalom , free food . No shellfish ! - That is so unfair . - Tell me about it . So you guys don 't believe in Robot-Jesus ? He was built and was well-programmed , but he wasn 't our messiah . And so , our company flames onwards . Planet Express : limitless potential , boundless horizons ! The unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe ! It 's been a terrible year . The company is on the verge of bankruptcy . - But the movie ... - A substantial loss for the company . The blue pie slice represents the money we earned . The green slice represents an $ 8 bank error in our favor . What about our thousands of shares of stock ? - Worthless . - I 'll kill you ! I own one share of Planet kajiggers , so I 'm entitled to some answers . Question : Why does no one visit me in my home ? Your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee ! This is perfect for me ! Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free ... ? You didn 't let me finish ! I was going to say " free food " ! - My name 's Joe and I 'm a defrostee . - Hello , Joe ! When I was frozen , carrots ruled the earth . But now they don 't . It takes some getting used to . In the 1 980s , I was the toast of Wall Street . I had whiskey with Boesky , cookies with Milken . But then , I was diagnosed with terminal bone-itis . Bone-itis ? That 's a funny name for a horrible disease . There was no cure . One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold its assets . Made 1 00 mil . I froze myself until a cure was found . And now here I am , ready to sleaze my way back to the top , ' 80s style ! As a caveman frozen in a glacier , I face many challenges . The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum . I 'm from your time . Remember that song , " Safety Dance " ? Sure do . That dance wasn 't that safe . I tell you , two go-go ' 80s Reaganauts like us could rule this world ! - Right . - lf only someone would give us a shot . They 're scared of us . But if you want a job , I could beg my company . Awesome . Awesome to the max ! And finally , the post office meter is for business mail only . Come on ! I 've got a lot of ransom notes to send ! Enough talk ! Time for action ! I move that everyone comes over to snuggle my cat ! - Second . - I move your cat stinks and is ugly ! - Second . I move that we vote on a new CEO and oust this old creep ! - And my cat smells good and is pretty . - Second . - Very well . I nominate the Professor ! - Second ! - I 'm your man ! - I vote my shares for the Professor . - The Professor ! - Me ! I nominate that guy . Because he knows about business and stuff and has a tie . Shares still count if they were washed , right ? If I know anything about which number is bigger ... Hold on ! Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the stranger . You have four times as much stock as the rest of us ? Scruffy believes in this company . It 's a tie . In the event of a tie , the Professor , as current CEO , remains ... I demand the floor ! I may only have one share , but I get to vote too ! And I 'm voting against the cat-hater ! Isn 't that right , kitty ? Hey ! You ate my change ! It 's settled . The new chief executive officer of Planet Express is " That Guy " ! Please welcome our new chief executive officer , That Guy ! There are two kinds of people : sheep and sharks . Anyone who 's a sheep is fired . Who 's a sheep ? Excuse me , which one do people like to hug ? Gutsy question . You 're a shark . Sharks don 't look back because they don 't have necks . Necks are for sheep . I 'm proud to shepherd this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top in this industry of ... - Package delivery . - Package delivery ? ! Oh , God ! Fantastic ! The first order of business , blame everything on the guy before me . - Professor ? - I 'll ruin you like I did this company ! Terrific . Question number one : What was your overall business plan ? Business plan ? Yes . I keep it here , right next to my heart . This is no business plan , it 's an escape plan . So long , suckers ! Fry , as a fellow ' 80s dollar jockey , I 'm making you my new vice chairman . I 'm rolling up the corporate ramp ! - It 's the end ! - We 're ruined ! What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain ? Thank you . Come again . That 's what I call a hostile makeover . Hair gel ? No , thanks . I make my own . We 'll shoot straight to the top and stay there , like Cindy Lauper ! I ask you , who is the number one delivery service on earth ? - Is it Planet Express , master ? - Is this guy a shark or what ? Seriously , we stink . Here 's the big enchirito . Mom 's Friendly Delivery Company . We can 't compete ! Her company is big and evil . We 're small and neutral . Switzerland is small and neutral . We 're Germany , ambitious and misunderstood . Everyone wants to be like Germany . Do we have the strength of will ? I say we do ! Will we let ourselves get beaten by an old lady ? Yes , my liege . No ! I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom ! Look at my butt ! You call that a pressed ham ? Walt , hit the retaliate button ! - Let 's see ... - Any button ! They all retaliate ! Yeah ! Hit him , hit him , hit him ! This is the high life ! Watching apes kill each other . In my day , we had coke parties , but the principle 's the same . Get your stinking trike off me , you damn , dirty ape ! Now that you 're my protégé it 's time I cut you in on the secret to success . Any guesses ? - Work really hard ? - No . - Oh , thank God ! - It 's all about appearances . It 's time to update our company 's image and give it the sleek , dazzling veneer of the 1 980s ! This company 's on the fast track to the It List . Kudos ! We haven 't made one delivery since you two took over . Delivery has nothing to do with our business . Image , people ! Scope out this new ad ! We are all one . One mind . One purpose . One act . Our enemy shall be eaten by scorpions . And we shall bow down and worship to ourselves . We shall prevail ! Hey , we were watching that ! Terrible ! People won 't know what we do . I don 't know what we do . Just kidding . What are we , a bus or something ? - Did you approve that awful ad , Fry ? - I did and I 'll tell you why . It grows the brand . Oh , Lord . This company 's circling the drain ! I 'd sell my stock for a sandwich . Sold ! A complete sandwich ! You got fleeced . I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside . What is this moose drip ? " The New Delivery Kings " ? I 'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts ! - But they 're kings , Mommy . - Jam a bastard in it , you crap ! Our private dining room . This is where we serve our most successful chumps . Tonight , that 's us . - What 's overpriced ? - Everything . - Bring me that . - Me too . And a glass of water . Okay , let 's work on your execu-speak . I 'm worried about " blank . " Don 't worry . Let me worry about " blank . " Good . I also would have accepted : " Blank ? Blank ! You 're not looking at the big picture ! " What a pleasant surprise . Shut up , booger-blaster ! It 's time we all talk . I 'll handle this , Fry . You get back to the farm , shift some paradigms . I 'm on it . But if you need me , you know where I 'll be . Call me a booger-blaster ! I 'll blast a booger ... - We 're worried about Planet Express . - Don 't . Let me worry about " blank . " That Guy is a con man , and you 've been hypnotized by his bologna ! - You 've changed , Fry . - What ? I haven 't changed . - Suz , have I changed ? - No , Mr. Fry . Thanks , doll . I don 't care . That Guy 's turning this place into some kind of business . This isn 't a business ! I thought of it as a source of cheap labor . Like a family . Right . We 're not a traditional family like the Murphys or the lesbian coven , but we 're a family . That Guy understands that . Everyone 's fired , and we 're out of business . I 'm selling Planet Express to Mom . She 'll gut the company , eliminate us . Don ' t let the door hit you on the way out . I don ' t want ass prints on my new door ! Ms. Johnson , please bring in some more chair fuel . I had no idea the company would be sold ! I was just an innocent suck-up ! Leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers . It 's so sad ! Where will I go ? What will I do ? You have Mrs. Darlinghaven 's cotillion at 7 , ma 'am . That 'll be fun . Ms. Johnson , you 've never lied to me . Am I a good person ? I don ' t know . I 'm a program in the intercom . I 've got to redeem myself ! Somehow , sometime for some reason , I 'll block this takeover ! Mr. Fry , your 2 : 00 magician is here . I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands . Reschedule . - Sell 1 00 soylent beans ! - Buy 3000 corn bellies ! - Two hundred cans of Whoop-Ass ! - Three bags of trash ! Attention . The takeover of PlanEx by Mom 's Delivery Company will take place in 1 0 minutes . I am Jorell , master of scheduling ! Okay . We 've got the hot tub hot , the wine coolers cool . It 's Hammer time ! You suck ! By regulation , both companies must approve the takeover . Planet Express shareholders , please vote . Great Bonda of Uganda ! We can vote against it ! I 'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers ! The shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg gave me majority control . Zoidberg owned 51 % of the company ? The shares were worthless ! He asked for toilet paper ! And now if MomCorp shareholders will cast their ballots . The ballot was confusing ! - How about a hand re-count ? - Okay . The takeover of Planet Express is approved ! - This stinks ! - Madame is outraged ! Security ! I want that bunch of rowdies out of here ! Wait a minute ! Hold on ! MomCorp will purchase all shares of Planet Express at the current market price , which is ... One hundred seven ! - And also it hurt my feelings ! - What are you solids griping about ? Your shares are worth $ 1 07 apiece . I 'm a millionaire ! Suddenly I have an opinion about the capital gains tax ! - I 'm even richer ! - I have no shares ! Wait ! My sandwich ! Has it also appreciated in value ? Please ! - You didn 't refrigerate it , spineless ! - You had to drag spines into this ! As vice chairman , I 'd like to say a few words . A time comes for every man that deserts his friends when he goes back how it was . For me , that time is now . So I ask you , as a friend , stop this deal . I 'm an ' 80s guy . Friendship means for $ 2 I beat you till you got detached retinas . The deal will go ahead as ... My bones ! Oh , my God ! His bone-itis ! I was so busy being an ' 80s guy , I forgot to cure it ! My only regret is that I have bone-itis ! He 's dead ! Feed him to the jackals ! Go on with the sale ! I don 't think so ! As vice chairman , I gain voting control of his shares . - Don 't be a fool ! - I 'll be whatever I want to do ! That Guy was the greatest businessman ever . Before his death , he taught me everything he knew . But some things I had to learn myself . I learned money is fine , but what counts is people . You can 't put a price on that . So I 'm giving control of the company to a man of experience Professor Hubert Farnsworth ! What ? I 'm awake ! I 'm awake ! Stop doing the right thing , jerk ! - Let Mom buy it ! We want to be rich ! - Two out of three doesn 't cut it . You 'd rather be rich than work together ? Hell , yeah ! This company was the only place I ever really felt at home . If being millionaires is more important than friendship then I 'll sell Planet Express , for you . Millionaires nothing ! The stock 's only worth three kajiggers ! Come on ! It 's worth less now than when it was worthless ! It is ? We 're poor no matter what I do ! The deal is off ! Once again , the conservative sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor ! Oh , I 'm ruined ! Why ? Why ? So we 're not millionaires . But we still get to work together . Shut your fat mouth ! See you guys Monday !

 Leave me alone ! D 'Argo : Previously on Farscape . You are not going to die . The only treatment is a tissue graft from a genetically compatible donor . Gilina . If a warrior cannot die in battle , she can at least die alone . One dose , some bed rest . This may help stabilize you until Crichton returns with the cure . I am Scorpius . What the hell was that ? A memory . Our spy has an interest in wormhole technology . And you can have Crichton when I have finished with him . We 've got to get you out of there . Get the sample back to Moya . Does Aeryn mean that much to him ? Crichton is in love with you . Crichton succeeded . Where is he ? I want to see him . My side , your side ! My side , your side ! Danger , Will Robinson . Beware the chair . Why the yotz are we still here ? The Prowler 's on board , isn 't it ? We should Starburst away from here before Crais finds out where we are . Pilot : We can 't . Starburst is not available . Nor is propulsion . We will be fortunate just to maintain orbit . But , Pilot , I thought Moya was prepared for one more Starburst . She was , but no longer . She has gone into what appears to be full labor . She chooses now to go into labor ? It 's a little inconvenient . She has little choice . And she is very frightened . Pilot , that 's a natural reaction during a birthing cycle . Moya tells me that this is not a natural birthing cycle . She 's now certain that there is something wrong with her child . It is not a normal Leviathan . How are you feeling ? Better . Lie back down . It may be some time before your strength returns completely . I hear I have you to thank for my life . Yeah . Oh , and , uh , the other one . What other one ? Gilina . Or don 't you remember her ? We met on the Zelbinion . Where 's Crichton ? You should rest now , Aeryn . Where is he ? Crichton 's still on the Gammak Base . He 's been captured by the Peacekeepers . They 're probing his mind using something called an Aurora Chair . Why didn 't anyone tell me ? Why haven 't you gone after him ? There are hundreds of Peacekeepers down there , Aeryn . I cannot infiltrate that base without being detected . Well , I can . ( groaning ) ( gasping ) Don 't try to stop me , D 'Argo . I won 't . I 'm strong enough to go alone . No , you 're not . I 'm coming with you . If you can be an idiot , I can be an idiot . Well , a warrior may be of some use to me down there but Zhaan , why don 't you stay here ? John might need me. lf he gets damaged by the chair then I can help him . I 'm hoping Crichton will be strong enough to fight the chair . ... brell phase distortion . Flight recorder getting all this ? What do you call the maneuver we 're doing now ? Slingshot . Holy mother , it 's a wormhole . ... it 's unstable . ( screaming ) Crais : There 's no use resisting , Crichton . The chair will rip the memories from you , even if you fight it . I 'm not resisting . The chair says he is . He 's holding something back . Crais : Then increase the extraction . Show us what you 're blocking ! I 'm not blocking . ( strained laughter ) About wormholes . ( screaming ) My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship , full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . ( faint electronic signal ) What are you doing there ? Don 't talk to me ! Stay ! You stay where you are ! Don 't talk to me ! There 's no talking to me ! I do my talking in the chair . Ah . You like the chair ? Love the chair , love the chair , love the chair . Are you spying on me , Stark ? Scorpy sent you in here to spy on me ? No , I 'm no spy for Scorpy . What you got there ? Nothing . Nothing . What is that ? No ! Stop . If you don 't stop , I 'm going to have to kill you . Give it a couple days . I think Scorpy and Peacekeeper Barbie will do it for you . ( growling ) You 're not crazy . Are you , Stark ? No . But if they think I am , they don 't bother me so much . So what you hiding there ? My baby . It 's a magnetic crypt encoder . I made it from scraps of metal I 've been collecting for two cycles . What 's it do ? If I get the sequence right , it can unlock the door . But it can only try one sequence at a time . ( laughing ) ( coughing ) You 're going to be here forever , if you 're waiting for that thing to get you out . At least I 'm trying something . Trash ! You 'll tell them about my baby , won 't you ? No . No , I 've kept things from them this far . I can keep this . Everyone can block thoughts for a while , Crichton , but eventually you 'll tell the chair . I 'm the only one who can block thoughts forever . How many times have you been in it ? Over one hundred sessions . Oh . Well , what is it ? What 's so important that you can keep it from the chair ? What do you know ? Nothin ' . I 'm tellin ' ' em the truth . What I 'm blocking has nothing to do with the wormholes ! Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Any sign they 've spotted us , D 'Argo ? Nothing 's tracking . The scanning blind that Gilina created seems to be holding . Let 's hope so . Zhaan : What about when we land ? There won 't be any sensors up top . The sensors would give away that there 's a Gammak Base underground . Distorted voice : John ! Who 's there ? John ? John ? Where 's that voice coming from ? Shut up ! Don 't say a word . Crichton : Gilina ? John , keep your back to the camera . They can see but they can 't hear . I remember. I ... I remember . Did you get the paraphoral tissue to Aeryn ? Chiana got it off the base , but I don 't know if she made it back to Moya in time . Who is that ? Who you talking to ? It 's a friend . She can help us get out of here . Now we both have a secret to keep . Gilina , I need some help . I need you to get them off my back for awhile . I 'll think of something . John , don 't worry . I 've got to go now . I can 't stay tapped in for long . Thanks . ( rumbling ) Pilot : Moya 's data stores indicate it may be best to get the offspring out as fast as possible . How the yotz do we do that ? It says we can try blasting the tranix with coolant from Moya 's thermal chamber . Then do it . I want this thing over with . I want to be still ... Rygel ! You 've got to stay calm during the birth . I amcalm. I ... I 've conceived hundreds of progeny . And those are only the official ones with my wives . Well then , you should know something about this . Or you should be able to help us . I was never present at the birth . Not one . Well , of course not . I think this is a trifle different , don 't you ? My progeny were tiny . Tiny and handsome . Like their father . ( rumbling intensifies ) Oh ! Technician : Okay , I 'm patched in here . Try it again . Niem : Hurry up ! Scorpius wants maximum power now . We just have to reroute the annex cable . We 're onto it . Alex , you need some help ? Oh , hi Gilina . Yeah , you 're not wrong . Uh , if you put the double cabling on-line , uh , I can finish patching in . Oh , sure , all right then , well ... you know all this better than me . - Mmm . - Mmm . Thanks . ( beeping ) Niem : Status report . Are we back on-line ? Technician : Checking power levels now . Just a few microts . Niem : Good . Niem : Are we ready ? Technician : All levels are go . Technician : Calibration complete . Niem : The chair is ready , Scorpius . Good . Follow us . Come on ... come on ... Gilina : John ! Gilina . I can 't talk right now . Looks like we got company . John , when you get into the chair just remember one thing . What ? Remember when we kissed on the Zelbinion . No . No , no , no , that 's the thing I 'm blocking . Trust me . I do trust you. I do . - Then remember the kiss . - Scorpy ! - Move back , Stark ! Get inside ! - But Scorpy , let me get into the chair ! Scorpy ! Will Scorpy let me get into the chair ? Have you finished ? Yes . You see , Crichton , this is what I 'm trying to keep you from . Yeah , Scorpy . You 're all heart . You show me everything that 's in your brain and I won 't torture you anymore . I 've shown you everything . The chair indicates that you 're holding something back . Chair 's wrong . What won 't you tell me ? I already know everything else . I know you 're living on a stolen Leviathan with escaped prisoners , and I know that Leviathan is pregnant . You know who the Daddy is ? ( laughing ) Why are you doing this to yourself ? What is so important that you 're willing to go through all of this ? I 'm not blocking anything . Bring him . I 'm going to enjoy ripping the truth out of you , Crichton . ( screaming and gasping ) Commander Crichton , it 's good to see you 're enjoying your stay with us . Crais , don 't you ever knock ? Stop ! What is that ? My question as well , Captain . ( electronic tone intensifies ) What do you want ? I 'm here to thank you . Yeah ? For what ? I 've never been one of the elite . Did you know that ? My parents were common farmers . I was shanghaied from their commune as a young boy . I rose through Peacekeeper ranks on my wits and my hatred . But still , some doors were always closed to me . Well , thanks for the family tree , Crais , but frankly , I don 't give a damn . With this wormhole information you 've given me I now have the power to rise where l should be . You don 't actually believe any of that , do you ? Come on , he made it all up ! You can 't make things up for the chair , Captain . You know that . What is that , hmm ? Crichton : I don 't know . Kind of looks like an episode of Melrose Place . What do you mean you don 't know what it is ? I don 't know . Damn ! What is it ? is that it , Crais ? is the game up ? What ? Crais , first found out about wormholes when I came through . I gave him the information disk in exchange for my life . That 's a lie ! No , it 's not . He 's lying ! Damn you , Crichton ! Tell him the truth ! So , nothing of what we saw was true ? No . Were you born on a farming commune ? Yes . Were you conscripted from it by the Peacekeepers ? Yes , but ... How does Crichton know this ? He must have stolen it from a database ... While in security three containment ? Look , I don 't know how he did it , but what you saw on there is not true . Of course , it 's not . But there 's only one way to be sure it is a lie . How ? For you to go in the chair . ( chuckles ) Me ? Yes . No captain has ever been subjected to such an indignity . There 's always a first for everything . Get Crichton back to his cell . You overstep yourself , Scorpius . You haven 't got the numbers to put me in the chair . Don 't I ? I commend your loyalty . It must be difficult to maintain for an officer like Crais , an officer on the edge and out of control . Talk to me , Scorpius , not to them . I have unconditional authority on a Gammak Base . Captain Crais will go to the chair . To stop that , you will have to kill me . And all my men . Are you prepared to do that ? Do not listen to him . That is an order . Do what you know in your hearts if the right thing . Put Crais in the chair . That 's the last of the gear from the Transport Pod . What are you doing with those explosives ? I 'm upgrading these primitive things . I found an access shaft . I should be able to get to the base and look for Crichton . Are you strong enough ? I better be . Stop . ( Crichton coughing ) I don 't know how she did it . But she did it . Rest , Crichton . No . No , no , no , we 've got to do something . I gotta get that door open . ( gasping ) Here . What is that ? What did you just show me ? I 'm able to give a few thoughts , that 's all . Rest , my friend . How long have you been here ? Two cycles . Peacekeepers killed most of my people , but they kept me alive because I interest them . I 'm able to hide thoughts that their chair can 't touch . It 's almost ironic . What made me a slave now keeps me alive . What made you a slave ? This . I 'm of the Banik slave race . Outsiders think that we do not feel but it 's only that our feelings don 't always show . Just as this can hide our feelings . We 're also able to cloud thoughts from our minds . What I know deep inside , Peacekeepers will never see . I did everything I could to avoid him ! The recruiter is here to pick you up . I 'm counting on you to protect him . Do you understand ? Bialar ! ( screaming ) Who is that ? My father ! Turn it off ! Don 't you like your past , Crais ? Turn it off ! Can 't you get to what he knows about wormholes ? No . He 's fighting it . ( screaming ) I don 't know anything ! Sir . is there surveillance inside this cell ? No . Aeryn . Chiana told me what you did for me . Thank you . What are you doing here ? The paraphoral tissue takes at least ten solar days before ... I don 't have ten days. I need to know where Crichton is . They have him on level nine containment . There is no way of reaching him without a direct order from Scorpius . John is blocking a memory from them . Scorpius thinks it has something to do with his precious wormholes , but it doesn 't . What does it have to do with ? Me . He 's protecting me , but as soon as Scorpius finds out that he knows nothing about wormholes , he 'll kill him . We 'll need more rocks if we 're going to hide the rest of these , D 'Argo . If the Peacekeepers come up through the level risers , this is where they 're going to surface . I hope those things work . Otherwise , there is not much to stand between us and them . I always wanted to ask you , D 'Argo . That Qualta blade . For a warrior , it seems a very unconventional weapon . Many cycles ago , there was a race even more feared than the Peacekeepers . The Teloks . They laid siege to my planet for over one hundred solar days . When the final assault came , all our warriors had were these unconventional weapons . My own great grandfather died in that war . When the final days come , Luxans believe that the Qualta blade will lead us to freedom . I understand , D 'Argo . Please forgive my curiosity . There is another thing we can do for you . What ? My Qualta blade and I can cut stones for you . Look , I 'm not going to say this again . There is nothing in there . Aeryn : I 'm just telling you what I picked up from Crais ' carrier . What 's going on ? Shh . I detected an unauthorized magnetic pulse coming from somewhere on this ... There is no signal coming from in there . Mm-hmm . Look , I 'll prove it to you . See ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . ( beeping ) What the frell is that ? Obviously nothing . ( trilling ) ( device beeping faster ) Get out of it , Stark . How could you ? You were right . I 'll move him to another cell . They don 't need to be moved . Why not ? Because they 're coming with me . She 's with me ! Who is she ? That is the radiant Aeryn Sun . Stark : How many Peacekeepers do you know on this base ? Are you all right , Crichton ? Yeah . How you doin ' ? I 'm better now . Come on . We 'd better go . Sorry . And no one outside this chamber knows of the Admiral 's orders . I saw to that , sir . ( gasps ) So now I know why you tried to fight the chair . Hmm . Are there any more barriers ? No , that 's what he was fighting to hold . And what Crichton saw about wormholes ? is not in this captain 's memory . Computer : Level one security breach . This is Scorpius . Guard : Sir , the human prisoner has escaped . How ? There 's a Peacekeeper working with him . Seal the base , everything . He must not reach the surface . It 's clear , come on . Go . Go . Go . You first . Peacekeepers . Come on . This way . Just go . Come on . In here . Keep searching . Pilot : Oh , no . What do you mean , " oh , no " ? To give birth , Moya must equalize pressure with her outside environment . You mean , you mean with space ? What ? Moya has to make a vacuum into here ? Yes. I can 't stop her . How much time do we have ? I don 't know . Maybe eighteen microts . Eighteen microts ! Well , where do we go ? My den 's stable . That 's lucky for you , isn 't it , prabakto ? We can 't get to you in eighteen microts . There are pressure tanks in Maintenance Bay six . I suggest you go . Go now . ( screaming ) ( grunting ) lt 's locked . Pilot , it 's locked ! Yes , it is , my dear . There 's plenty of room in here . I 'm not getting in there . That 's all there is . Get inside . You only have ten microts . Alright then ! ( alarm sounding ) Right . Any other ways off the base ? They 're sealing all the access shafts . It means they 're shutting down everything . There 's got to be some way out of here . No way . Everything else , even the lock they just put on , you need an ident Chip from a senior officer . All right , let 's go bag a senior officer . No , I 'll do it , Crichton . You stay with him . Excuse me , I 'm just making myself comfortable . What is that ? Uh , what ? That . Oh , it 's nothing . Where 's your hand , slug-face ? It , it 's down there . ( laughing ) I know . Keep it in your caftan , pal . Pilot ! Oh ... Pilot ! I 'm very busy now , Chiana . You two okay ? How 's Moya ? Oh , yes . The offspring 's coming now . I can see it . I must go , Chiana . ( straining ) ( breaking wind ) ( moans ) ( high-pitched voice ) : What was that ? ( high-pitched voice ) : Ah , nothing , eh ? Just a bit of helium . Helium . - Yes , I ... I don 't like being in confined spaces . I ... I get nervous . You 're disgusting . Hmm ? ( explosion ) ( shuddering ) Captain Crais . What are you doing in this chair ? Who 's that ? Who 's there ? I suppose I shouldn 't expect you to recognize my voice . Did Scorpius send you ? Release me from this chair . Why ? So that you can kill me , the way that you killed Lieutenant Teeg ? Who ... Who are you ? I am irreversibly contaminated . Now do you know who I am ? Aeryn Sun . Does this contaminate you , Crais ? As a Peacekeeper , you took a blood oath to obey your commanding officer . Till death . - Yes . I am still your commanding officer . But I am no longer a Peacekeeper . You are a Peacekeeper for life ! On the oath you ... Your oath means nothing to me . You made sure of that . You destroyed everything . I lost everything because of you . Aeryn Sun ... Do you know what I learned while I was away from you ? Everything I lost isn 't worth a damn and I don 't want to go back to your past . I order you ! You order me ? ! You will never order me again . I will track you down and kill you , Officer Sun . On that , I give you my vow ! You know what I give you , Crais ? Your life . ( grunting ) I will make you watch your life . ( electronic whirring ) ( screaming ) ( screaming continues ) Where 's Aeryn ? She should be here by now . Do you want to be with her , Crichton ? What ? Do you want to be with Officer Sun ? ( chuckling ) Gilina , can we talk about this another time ? No . No , I don 't think we can . You want me to go with you . You want me to give up everything I know , so you must answer me . Do you want to be with her ? ( shuffling sound above ) Aeryn : Only me . Let 's go . ( grunts ) Aeryn , did you bag yourself a senior officer ? Ran into an old friend . Let 's go . Let 's get out of here . Okay . Come on . Do you want to be with Crichton ? I 'm sorry ? He won 't answer my question . Will you ? Gilina , whatever the two of you have been discussing , it 's none of my business . - Yes , it is . - Come on . He asked me to go with him , and I cannot do that if he loves you . Gilina , you have to come with us . If you don 't come they will kill you . I 'll be okay . Gilina , you 've saved my life , and you know Peacekeepers . They will come and they will find you . I can take care of myself . You take care of John . Gilina , tell John . At least come and talk to him before ... They used a senior officer 's ident Chip and they 're climbing the air vent to the surface . I thought as much . Do you want me to burn them out ? No , we need Crichton alive . We 'll take the level risers and beat them to the surface . Let 's go ! Right . ( men shouting in the distance ) Where 's Gilina ? She 's not coming with us . What ? What 'd you say to her ? I didn 't say anything to her . It 's a decision she made on her own . I got to get her . Crichton , we don 't have time for this . She has gone. lt 's what she wants . Come on . ( electronic chirping ) ( Rygel grunting ) ( moaning ) ( high-pitched voice ) : Pilot ! Pilot , are we re-pressurized yet ? ! Yes . You can get out now . ( grunts ) ( coughing ) Finally . Chiana , I didn 't mean to ... Shut up ! Something 's still not right . A portion of the offspring can 't get clear of Moya 's external vent . I 'm getting a closer visual now . What is that ? What ? What 's wrong ? The offspring , look . Chiana : That 's Moya 's child ? Yes . But it 's covered in weapons . When D 'Argo broke the contraception wall half a cycle ago , the Peacekeeper catalyst he released must have contained a DNA signature to produce weapons . Will that grow as big as its mother ? Possibly bigger . Will Moya control him or the Peacekeepers ? I don 't know . There 's never been a Leviathan with weapons before , but we have a more immediate problem . Look . The birthing channel was not designed for this manner of offspring . It cannot fly free . It is panicking and starting to charge its way forward . Well , is he going to shoot his way out of Moya ? I think so . Pilot , can you force an atmosphere I can breathe into that vent ? Yes . Yes , I think so . Maybe ... maybe I can climb down the internal shaft and cut a seam , so the child can get itself free . You 'd better hurry . D 'Argo : It 's good to see you again . Zhaan : Come on . They 're not far behind . The Transport Pod is this way . Let 's go . Keep your weapons ready . Peacekeeper : Let 's go ! Heskon : Eight and nine . Load weapons ! D 'Argo : Aeryn , watch out ! Zhaan : Cover me , Aeryn ! Go . ( Crichton yelling ) What was the secret you were keeping hidden from Scorpius down there ? They thought it was about his doomsday device . About wormholes. lt wasn 't . It was only about the time I kissed a girl . Really ? Yeah . ( laughing ) Okay , uh ... Don 't shoot me , baby Moya . Just , um ... stay nice and calm . Nice and calm . What were you keeping from him ? The memory of a place I saw when I was a boy . Must 've been one hell of a place . I can 't do it , Pilot ! You have to . It won 't move ! Moya 's trying to control the offspring but that weapon 's primed to fire . So let it fire . Tell Moya to let the gun fire at low blast level . What ? ! I know it 's crazy , but it 's the only way . If we don 't get this child out , it 'll destroy Moya 's bulkhead . Go , Zhaan ! Crichton ! We 're coming ! Come on . Let 's give them something to remember us by . ( both laughing ) ( Peacekeepers screaming ) Not yet ! - Let me get out of here ! - l can 't stop it ! Get out now ! Just get out ! Run , Chiana , run ! ( screaming ) That was a low-level blast ? That did it . The offspring 's free . It 's free . How 's Moya ? She 's okay . We 're okay . Not quite . You 're not going with them . ( laughing ) Shoot him , Gilina . Shoot him ! ( moaning ) Gilina ! We must get back to the Transport Pod . The firewall is dissipating . ( Gilina moans ) Pilot : Before she left the Gammak Base , Gilina scrambled the scanning datafiles . Even Crais 's Carrier can 't find us now , which is quite fortunate , because we can 't Starburst with the offspring . We can 't move very far at all . Thank you , Pilot . How 's Gilina ? Not good . What about Moya 's child ? He 's okay . He ? It 's a boy ? Yes . A male . Excellent . What kind of a beast is he ? Just lie still , let Zhaan 's medicine do its work . You 'll be fine in a little while . ( heavy breathing ) No more lies , John . I 'm not lying . Gilina , why did you come back for us ? I had to help you . Aeryn was right . If I 'd stayed there they would 've found out about me . Found out that I ... I love you . Gilina . ( gasp of pain ) Crichton : Zhaan ... Stark : May I help ? May I give you this ? It 's a place I once saw . I 've been carrying it with me for a very long time . ( exhaling ) Oh , it 's beautiful . It 's beautiful . There now . Just hold onto it . Don 't let go . John . Yeah ? Do you think ... if things had been different ... that you could 've loved me ? Yeah . Kiss me one more time . Shh . - Kiss me ... - Don 't talk ... ( exhaling )

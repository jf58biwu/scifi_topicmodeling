Her name was Mayumi . I can tell you this ... we were a perfect couple . Mayumi ! But there was one thing that I never understood . After our dates , she always went home ... in a different direction . Sometimes she went to the north . Sometimes she went to the south . She went to the west , to the east , and to the north ... Where does Mayumi live ? She never told me her address or her telephone number . Yes ? Mayumi ? Okay . Okay . Mayumi was the one who always planned our dates . I suffered with suspicions and jealousy . Maybe Mayumi has many boyfriends . Maybe I am only one of many . Yes . It must be that I So one day ... ' Bye . I followed her home . But ... I 'm sorry ... but I can 't see you anymore . Mayumi . I just wanted to know where you live . We love each other . But why don 't you tell me ? Is there a reason ? I will tell you the truth . But ... I don 't think you will believe me . Why ? I am ... an alien . What are you saying ? If I was going to lie , I 'd tell you better one . I came to the Earth for a purpose . My face and body are not the real me . I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you before . But ... it was true when I said I loved you . Wait ! Can 't I see you anymore ? Maybe we will meet again . But I don 't think you will notice . My appearance will be very different . Six months later ... SHINSAI BASHI Long time no see . Yes ? - It 's me . - Who are you ? That 's bad . You forgot about me ? - It 's me ! - Who are you ? It 's me . Mayumi . You were sucking my left nipple so much ... my nipple was so sore . It 's still sore , you know . Well , you and I were ... great with each other . But I don 't think you will notice . My appearance will be very different . - My youth was ruined . - It 's so miserable . I was chosen in a way . Satomi ... I think you were chosen , too . YOU ARE CHOSEN Did your memory fool you recently ? And look at your scar on your hand . - Abduction ! - Kidnapped . You have been kidnapped by aliens . It 's not me . My daughter was kidnapped . Daughter ? Do you have a daughter ? Behind this kidnapping is hidden some awful family sin . - Sin ? - Cruelties . For example , child abuse . I wonder when you got this scar . Perhaps you have had it since you were a child . You and your family just didn 't realize it . So it looked like the scar suddenly appeared . That 's not true ! - Easy , easy . Relax . - Easy . Easy . Easy . We need to see your family . Where is your house ? Where is your mother ? My mother ? - Lucy ! - Okay . Look at this light . You are getting ... sleepy and sleepy . You are getting ... sleepy and sleepy . You are getting ... Hypnotism . Mother . You remember me now . Where is Misato ? She is here , isn 't she ? Misato ? - This is it . - Your shoes . We will investigate here on suspicion of kidnapping . But this is my wife 's parents ' house . Don 't be silly . The threatening telephone call was made from here . Kiyohiko , what is going on ? Mother , Satomi is in trouble . Did you two plot together about this ? I 'm the mother of Satomi Kurahashi . Go find the daughter ! - Yes . - Shoes . Wait . What are you doing ? - Did you find her ? - No . - She is not here . - She must be upstairs ! - Yes ! - Wait . There 's nothing upstairs . Mr. Kameyama . When were the police allowed ... to come into a civilian 's house ... without taking off their shoes ? I 'll bring that matter up at the Diet . But we are conducting an investigation . What are you investigating ? There isn 't a little girl . She doesn 't even exist . Why don 't you ask her ? That 's right . Satomi doesn 't have a daughter . How about that , Detective ? Do you believe me now ? Well ... - But Mother , something is funny . - What ? The doll is gone . I can 't find it anywhere in the house . The doll ? Then the picture is ... Mother , what is the doll ? You can tell him everything . My dear , this is the time to tell him everything . Satomi had an older sister . Her name was Misato . The doll was Misato 's favorite . Does Satomi know about that ? She shouldn 't know that . When Satomi was a baby ... Misato was burned to death in a fire . Satomi hurt her leg at that time . I carried baby Satomi ... and ran away from the fire . Then I went back to the house ... and I kept calling for Misato . I heard the voice calling me . " Mother , mother ... " I saw a shadow moving in the fire . So I held her tight . And I saved Misato from the fire . I thought so . But ... what I was holding was a doll . I know you think I 'm a fool of a mother ... but I really saw it . The doll was moving in the fire . That 's why I made the mistake ... And what happened ? After we moved into this house , Satomi started to say funny things . " Mother , there is someone in the closet . She says she wants to be let out . " She said that so many times , I opened the closet . I found the doll in there . I was sure that I had thrown it away . Satomi really liked the doll and named it . She named it after her sister ; she didn 't even know . And she took care of the doll just like it was her own daughter . Then her sister 's soul possessed the doll ... No ! It 's not that . The doll took the sister 's soul . What is the doll ? Who is upstairs ? Satomi ? Satomi ! She is not Misato . I told you , there is no Misato . Now you understand . This is not a police job . This is the story of Satomi 's family ... and about a very , very deep sin . Go home . - Okay . - What ? - Let 's go . - But ... Satomi , we don 't have a child . We haven 't even made love . I don 't want to make you dirty . You are pure . You are a virgin . Virgin ? Satomi ? Are you ... Now you realize where your child is . It is in a house every women has . - Excuse me ... - What ? - You are still here ? - Well ... Can I use your bathroom ? Number two ... You will bear a child of mixed blood . My seed is not normal , you know . Mother , you are not human . I need to use a bathroom ... This is just vacant land . Are you sure this is it ? I was out here today ! Excuse me , do you know where Kurahashi 's house is ? Kurahashi ? Kurahashi 's house burned down in a fire 20 years ago . A fire ? Yes . Fire . Come here ! I am an obstetrician . Honey ! Kiyohiko , whose side are you on ? Whose ? The side of the Earth , or our side ? Satomi , be patient just a little while . They won 't hurt you . No ! Stop it ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Our mixed-blood baby will rule the Earth ! It hurts ! When did she fall here ? Satomi ? Satomi , wake up ! I can 't allow it . My blood has been mixed with an alien 's . - Blood . - Blood . I went on looking for them . And ... MY HUSBAND , COME BACK ! The Yoshiro Yoshida Show I Who is the woman who ran away with your husband ? Who is she ? - SATOMI KURAHASHI - My mother . It 's rude to ask , but how much older ... is your mother than your husband ? About 20 years . Well , maybe your husband is watching this show now . If you have something you want to say ... please say that to him in front of the camera . Go ahead . Kiyohiko , where are you ? Let 's start life from the beginning . Let 's talk . I also want to talk to you , Mother . I lost all the family that I trust . I 'm all alone now . Please come back . Please at least call me . Don 't do something stupid I She is such a pretty woman ... She is a good actress . That woman is dangerous . Be cautious . Yes . I know . - Let 's go . - Yes . The next guest is Oppara Taro . The song he will sing is , " Sexy Lips . " What nice weather . It sure is . Misato , here . It 's your toy . The woman is coming . What ? No way . She is coming ! She is coming ! This is it . You fake obstetrician . What do you want , Satomi ? I can 't forgive you . What are you talking about ? We are just protecting Misato . - Misato doesn 't exist . - She is right here . You forced me to bear this mixed-blood , alien baby . I won 't forgive you . Can you see this is Misato ? Mama ! Mama ! She is a doll . The doll was an alien . Satomi , I 've been helping your mother out . Can 't you hear the child 's cry ? Do you think a doll can talk ? Mama ! Don 't kill me ! Mama ! Don 't kill me ! I won 't be fooled ! Don 't ! Mama ! Mama ! Help me ! It 's hot ! It 's hot ! It hurts ... At the autopsy , they found out that she was my daughter . Everything was my crazy fantasy . I burned my daughter to death . Misato ! - You killed her . - No ! - You set her on fire . - No ! Take her away . Yes . My mother was protecting my daughter from my fantasy . Mr. Kameyama was consulting her about it . Just pray . Every sin is atoned for by Jesus ' blood . I will die , won 't I ? I 'm still very young . Don 't hang onto this life . - Pray ! - Sister . Is there a hell ? I think there is . I 'm going there ... as punishment . It 's time . An invisible chain Is binding my heart I can 't Remove The inflamed scar I can 't go back To you anymore The sin I committed Is deeper Than the ocean Even if I struggle Even if I wriggle I can 't remove My Sin I brought her .

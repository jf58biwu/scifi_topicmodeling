 First time giving blood ? Yes . They pay cash here . And there 's no limit to how many times you give . They even buy it in the jar . Jared Nomak , we 're ready for you . In the past 12 months , have you gotten a tattoo , or undergone any ear , skin , or body piercings ? No . Where did you get that scar on your chin ? Childhood accident . You say you don 't have any immediate next of kin , - is that right ? - Not that I 'm in contact with . Nobody to call in case of an emergency ? No one . - No family ? - I told you , no . Are you telling me I can 't be a donor ? It depends . We came up with some unusual results on your blood test . What ? How unusual ? Let me explain . Your blood has a very rare phenotype , one we haven 't encountered before . What ? What are you talking about ? - Who are you ? No . - Sit down , please . What is this ? This is a good news-bad news scenario , Jared . Good news for us ... bad news for you . Forget what you think you know- - vampires exist . My name is Blade . I was born half human , half vampire . They call me " The Daywalker . " I have all their strengths , none of their weaknesses . Except for the thirst . 20 years ago I met a man that changed that . Whistler . He taught me how to hold the thirst at bay . Taught me the rules . Gave me the weapons to hunt with . Silver , garlic , sunlight . Two years ago he was attacked . They took him , and turned him into the thing I hate most . I should have finished him off . Now I 'm hunting him . I will find him . And nothing will stand in my way . Daywalker 's here ! Stop him ! Where is he ? Hey ! No , no . Take me to him , and I 'll consider you a loose end . Catch you later . Old man ... Look at what they 've done to you . Let 's go home . Lock up your daughters , boys and girls , the dark knight returns . - Need a toke of the smokage , B ? - Later . Cut the lights . You found him . You didn 't kill him . Give me a hand . I got a bad feeling about this , B. Listen to his breathing . He 's already dying . He 's in pain . Why don 't you just put him out of his misery right now ? They had him on stasis in a halfway house . I 'm giving him an accelerated retro-viral detox . Like a heroin addict . Make him go cold turkey in one night . Shit ain 't going to work , man . I say you kill the motherfucker right now . Get out . If there 's anything left of you in there , Whistler , Listen up . In the morning those blinds are going to open whether you 're cured ... or not . Hey , man , I didn 't mean to call him- - Listen to me , Blade . You 're going to have to finish me off . No . Give me that damn gun . Now walk away . Stubborn son of a bitch . How do you feel ? Like hammered shit . How 'd you find me ? I started out in Moscow . Then Romania . - They kept moving you around . - How long was I gone ? - Months ? - Too long . Years . They tortured me almost to death . And then let me heal in a vat of blood so they could go at it again . Sorry sons of bitches could have at least fixed my goddamn leg while they were at it . Where 's my arc welder ? What 's up ? Nice to meet you . I heard a lot about you . I 'm Josh . You can call me " Scud . " Everybody does . Tell me something , Skid- - No , man , it 's " Scud , " like " Stud . " Whatever . - What are you doing here ? - The pimpmobile ? Just a little aftermarket modification . - Nitrous oxide and shit like that . - Oh , yeah . You gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping . The whole package will crank that Betty up , maybe 300 horsepower . You 'll burn the thing out before your next oil change . Where did you dig up this shitbird , anyway ? What the fuck is your problem , Poppy ? My problem is I 've been sucking blood clots for two years . I get out to find some jerkoff fucking with my life 's work . We jeopardized our whole operation to save your ass ! - Our operation ? - Yeah . Our operation ? I built this operation , you ass-wipe ! Motion sensors ! It 's on three , gentlemen . Human ? Body temperature , 50 . I 'd guess suckhead . Fried . They 're using magnesium flares . They 've got your security system scoped out . Whoa , whoa , whoa . I don 't trust you- - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Cool outfit . Guard lights ! We represent the ruling body of the Vampire Nation . They are offering you a truce . They want to meet with you . Scud . Take off your mask . My name is Asad . This is Nyssa . You have been our most feared enemy . But now there 's something else loose on the streets . Something worse than you . What 's so funny ? They tell stories about Blade as the Bogeyman . Frankly , I 'm disappointed . You hear that , B ? She 's disappointed . He agreed to come along so easily . Come on , B , show her . Pretty please ? Semtex . Enough explosives to level a city block . You still disappointed ? The guards look human . They 're probably familiars . You sure about this ? Well , if I 'm not ... The true power of the Vampire Nation lies here . Father ? Blade , this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos . It has been said , " Be proud of your enemy and enjoy his success . " In that regard , I should thank you . - For what ? - Eliminating Deacon Frost . You did us a favor . Karel Kounen . - You 're human . - Barely . I 'm a lawyer . European Health Consortium . As you may know , Vampirism is ... a horrible virus , carried in the saliva of predators . In 72 hours , it spreads through the human bloodstream , creating new parasitic organs . Like cancer . Cancer with a purpose . Unfortunately , viruses evolve , too . We 've encountered a new one . We dubbed it the Reaper Strain . And like any good pathogen , it appears to have found a carrier . There ... Jared Nomak . Born a vampire , but an anomaly like you . Unlike the rest of us , however , he feeds on not just humans , but vampires as well . - Looks like he was doing me a favor . - You 're missing the point . Their vampire victims don 't die ... they turn . They become carriers . You 've got to understand . These things are like crack addicts . They need to feed daily . Nomak 's been up for 72 hours . By our estimates , there are already a dozen Reapers . There 'll be hundreds before the week is out . Thousands within a matter of months . Do the math . Wait . Let me get this right . You want me to hunt them ... for you ? When they are finished with us , who do you think they 'll turn on next ? Your precious humans . Not one of them will be left . We spent two years training a small tactical unit- - The Bloodpack . We want you to lead them . Two years ? We 've been training to hunt you . So , B-man , what do you think ? Sounds like a plan . What do you really think ? They 're going to fuck us the first chance they get . So , we ain 't gonna do this , right ? We 'll play along for now . They 'll take us in deeper than we 've ever been . Get a chance to see how their world really ticks . I had enough of their world . They 're just shitting bricks because they 're no longer top of the food chain . Damn , man , I 'm really worried about him . I know he 's your friend and all , but I think you should watch him . Nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in just one night . Looking to get hooked up ? Maybe . What do you have ? No problem . Horse , Hawaiian Ice , whatever you need . Whatever I need . I like that . What if I need you ? So , so sweet . They are ready whenever you are , Daywalker . Blade , meet The Bloodpack . Lighthammer , Verlaine , Priest , Snowman , Chupa , and Reinhardt . Hey , um ... me and the gang were wondering ... What was that ? Can you blush ? Here we go . Oh , I get it . I see now . You 've been training for two years to take me out . And now , here I am . Ooh , so exciting , isn 't it ? Okay , here 's your chance . Come on . What are you waiting for ? Here I am . Right here in front of you . Adolf here gets the first shot . Come on . What are you looking at her for ? You need permission ? Maybe you need a little bit of incentive . Okay , I can help with that . What 's the matter ? Missed that ? It 's okay , I can do it again . Come on . What , do you need a manual ? - Do it ! - Kill the bastard ! Now you 've got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head . Silver nitrate . Rigged to go off if anybody tampers with it . I 'll have the detonator with me . And you- - if you so much as look at me wrong- - From now on we work as a unit . You 'll be taking orders from me . Any questions ? Good . You want to catch the hunter ? You start with the prey . We 'll target all the night places where vampires congregate . Blood banks , safe houses . The bigger the better . So ... what 's first ? The House of Pain . Where 's the entrance ? I don 't see any signs . No vampire glyphs . No , because of you , we 've had to rethink our habits , tighten our security . Have a closer look . Nice . .38 , .45 and 9mm caliber . All with foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate , and garlic extract . This hyper-velocity stake gun spits out a silver stake at 6,000 feet per second . Since you suckers don 't like sunlight , we 've modified the gun 's entry light with a UV filter . Pop it open- - instant UV light . Filter 's on , no problem . Yo , B , check this out . It 's got an pneumatic syringe delivery system . The vials are filled with an anti-coagulant called EDTA . One punch with this , you 'll blow your target up like a balloon . The cartridge ejects . Automatic reload . Nice . - Let 's go . - You won 't pass for one of us . - Like I give a shit . - No , he 's right . Why don 't you post up on the roof over there ? Cover our backs . So the Bloodpack 's calling the shots now , huh ? Great . Better curb that dog of yours or we 'll do it for you . Keep pushing , asshole . [ M ] I ya , I against I [ M ] [ M ] Flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind [ M ] [ M ] Two of a kind , but one won 't survive [ M ] [ M ] My images reflect in the enemy 's eye [ M ] [ M ] And his images reflect in mine the same time [ M ] [ M ] I ya , I ya , I against I [ M ] [ M ] Flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind [ M ] [ M ] Two of a kind , but one won 't survive [ M ] [ M ] Survive , survive , survive . [ M ] We 're in . You 're about to enter our world . You will see things- - feeding . Just remember why you 're here . I haven 't forgotten . What exactly are we looking for in here ? Anything that looks suspicious . You got to be kidding me . Scud , do you read me ? - Scud , you reading me ? - Reading you loud and clear . The whole place is a safe house . The windows are painted black , one access door . - 200 , 300 suckheads in here . - That sounds cool . Hey , W , you got me ? W ? Tell me something , how 's the weather up there ? Walkin ' on sunshine , toad boy . Look at them . Half of these bastards , they 're not even pure bloods . I tell you what , why don 't we just fucking kill everyone ? Just to make sure . God , it would be so easy . He 's got you . Daywalker . Mother 's milk . I say we got about half an hour till sunrise , Cinderella . Hurry up . I spotted one , but lost it . Be on the lookout . Fuck . Whistler , they 're on the roof . I got them on the roof of my bus . Shhh . Nomak . Daywalker . What am I to you ? Is the enemy of my enemy my friend ... or my enemy ? We 're under attack ! There 's three of them . Probably more . Daylight . Silver don 't do jack shit . Don 't waste the bullets ! - Motherfucker . - You hear me , Chupa ? Say , " cheese . " Come on . How about some daylight , motherfucker ? Fuck ! Listen to me . If you 're under attack , use your UV lights . Use your UV lights . They can 't take the light . Priest ? We 're not dying here . - Come on . - Priest is down . Daylight 's coming . You 're on your own , Blade . You want me so bad , Blade ? Here I am . Why kill me ? You and I , we have the same enemy . We want the same thing . We need the same thing , Blade . What happened ? Why didn 't you tell me these things - were immune to silver and garlic ? - I didn 't know . If you did , would you have told me ? I think you know the truth when you hear it . Mm-hmm . Then why didn 't he kill you ? How long since he 's been bitten ? - About 20 minutes . - His skin is fucking burning . He 's already starting to change . Will someone just shut him the fuck up ? Hold on ! - Hold him , Chupa ! - Come on , man ! Put him out of his fucking misery ! Don 't you get it ? You can 't finish him that way ! Hold him down ! Hold him down , Chupa ! Move . Back off ! If that was your Bloodpack Sunday punch , - we 're in trouble . - This motherfucker left his post . - He just disappeared . - Where were you ? Ran into a little Reaper action myself . Oh , yeah ? How little ? We lost a man . Priest . You want me to carve his name on your chest ? Let me show you . Saw him moving in the alley and followed it down . Found it just like this . I think they came through here . It was trying to crawl back in the culvert . Caught his arm . Been gnawing at it like a coyote . Little Boy Blue . It 's already dying . I need to examine it as quickly as possible . Okay , look for a lever . Let 's open it . They 've made contact with the Reapers . - Any casualties ? - One so far . It was not ... Nyssa , I trust ? No . This a dangerous game you 're playing , Damaskinos . Blade is too volatile . You 're not going to be able to keep manipulating him . You worry too much . I 've been informed by our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted . You 've already lost one of your own . How many more are you willing to sacrifice ? Everyone . Even your own daughter ? Yes . Even her . Recognize this ? The blood bank . He 's one of the guards . So why is he dying ? What 's killing him ? Time . His metabolism is burning too fast . They need fresh blood every couple of hours , or they 'll start feeding on themselves . Nomak 's different . He 's the carrier . It all started with him . It 'll end with him . Open the mouth , Scud . Open the mouth . B , come on . Sissy . Only the tongue carries the virus . It is injected through these barbs . It has bifurcated masseter muscles . Overdeveloped , allowing for a much stronger bite . The jaw structure remains the same . But there 's no mandible bone . Squeeze that tooth . Neurotoxin . Probably paralyzes their victim while they feed . Garlic don 't work . Silver , that don 't work . We got to go with the sunlight , right ? That 's deadly to us , too . So let 's see what else we can find . These things are as different from us as we are from you . Look at that . The heart is encased in bone . Only the side is vulnerable . Good luck getting a stake through that . Pull a leg off a spider , it keeps moving on its own , essentially trying to walk without a body attached to it . - What are you doing ? - Hard-wired , right ? What the fuck is that ? Brain 's dead . Body 's still trying to feed . We got six hours before sunrise . Be ready by then . Hey ... What happens at sunrise ? Blade , I 'm talking to you . What happens at sunrise ? - We hunt . - In broad daylight ? You got be joking . You better get you some sunscreen , buttercup . Listen , shitkicker . You 're about one cunt hair away from hillbilly heaven . I love it when you talk dirty . Sunlight 's the only edge we 've got . - They 'll be more vulnerable then . - And so will we . Let 's be real about one thing- - I don 't expect everybody to make it back tomorrow . Remember to protect yourselves ... at all times . What are you looking for ? Phosphor rods . If I can suss out the light source maybe I can make some sort of UV flash-bang grenade or something . It 's been tried already . Yeah , but you didn 't have the Scudster working on it then . - Blade . - Hmm ? - The way you talk to them- - us . - What is it ? We are together in this , remember ? Why do you hate us so much ? It 's fate . - It 's in my blood . - It 's in mine , too . I 'm a pure blood . I was born a vampire . You know the thirst better than any of us , shooting that serum of yours . The only difference between us , is that I made peace with what I am a long time ago . How long have you known Blade , anyway ? Going on 20 years . He doesn 't talk about the old days that much . Blade doesn 't talk about anything much . You want to hear something funny ? Blade kind of looks at you like a father figure . Tell me something . How 'd you two hook up ? I was backpacking . I met these two chicks , decided to take them back to my tent for a little " Three 's Company " action . - Pretty . - Next thing I know , Janet and Chrissy start tearing chunks out of my stomach . Blade shows up , saves my ass . Everything else just sort of fell into place . - Let 's try it . - All right . Maybe I fucked up . Maybe you were right . All right . Papa 's got a brand new bag . Let me ask one question . How are we going to find these Reapers ? We won 't have to . They 'll come to us . - What is this shit ? - Pheromones . Harvested from the Reapers' adrenal glands . They 're going to key to it . They want us to spray on some suckpuppy 's nutjuice ? First use your firearms to drive them back . - Then toss your UV grenades . - Right on . This is what we got for the grand finale . I hot-wired a couple of these babies into a nitro-vacuum . Just be real careful where you pop your load . And you , you 're not coming ? No . I 'm a lover , not a fighter . UV 's have a 10-second delay . Nyssa ... just remember to take cover . Hey , Blade , give me a hand . You and Miss Muffet getting a little cozy ? I wouldn 't worry about that if I were you . Looks to me like you 're getting confused as to which side of the line you 're standing on . Those are real hollow words coming from a man who just spent two years running with the enemy . And what the hell is that supposed to mean ? You know , Whistler , there 's an old saying- - " Keep your friends close , but keep your enemies closer . " You might want to remember that . Blade , we should split into three units . We 're trying to attract them , not scare them off . Yeah , well , some of us can 't see in the dark , you fucking nipplehead . What am I supposed to do ? Bifocals , grandpa . And try to keep up . Let 's do this . - Hey , hillbilly . - What the fuck you doing ? Ain 't nobody here but you ... and us , buttercup . We lose a partner , and Blade loses one ! I 'll leave you two lovebirds some time to yourselves . Ah ! I spotted a group in the east tunnel . I 'm prepping the bomb pack . Nyssa . Get out ! Right now ! No ! No ! I 'll attract them to me . Do what I tell you . Move ! 10 ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one . Piece of junk . What the hell is this ? You trying to stink me to death , old man ? Wait . - You okay ? - Yeah . We got to move . We got a lot of company . All units , regroup . Regroup ! Eat shit , you ugly motherfuckers ! There 's nobody left ! - Where 's the bomb pack ? - Down that tunnel . Give me the rest of the pheromones . Go down that tunnel ! Go , go , go , go ! You obviously ... do not know ... whom you are fucking with ! By the way , Blade . Did I happen to mention the bomb lever is stuck ? Suck this ! Let 's go ! You want a bite of me ? Well , come on ! Come on , motherfucker ! Whistler . Wait . You will survive this only to tell Blade ... about this ring . About the truth . The truth , old man . Damaskinos ... Nyssa . You 've done a great job . Not that great- - I 'd say . What is it , my daughter ? They took them . All our weapons . Even your sword . Somebody 's been keeping tabs on us from inside . - Where are we ? - Some kind of chamber deep in their lair . They smashed up everything- - the workshop , all of it . They 've been lying to us from day one . The reaper strain didn 't evolve ... it was designed . What ? Designed . Nomak told me . I saw him back in the sewer . - He let me live . - Did he ? How generous of him . I brought you here to see the fruits of our labor . For years I 've struggled to rid our kind of any hereditary weaknesses . And so , recombining DNA ... was simply the next logical step . Nomak was the first . A failure . But in time , there will be a new pure race , begotten from my own flesh , immune to silver , soon even sunlight . I got a question for you , you lying son of a bitch . You want to explain how Nomak got a hold of this ring ? I would have thought that was obvious at this point . I gave it to him , of course . A gift from father to son . I thought he 'd never leave . The wolf has lain with the sheep long enough . Reinhardt , you can kiss your ass goodbye . I 'm sorry , man . B , you 're wasting your time , man . The bomb 's a dud . It was never supposed to explode . It was just supposed to make you feel in control . You thought you had me on a short leash , didn 't you , jefe ? Much better . See this ? I 'm one of Damaskinos' familiars . They needed my help to bring you here to control Nomak . The old fuck , he was always just bait . I mean , look at him . He 's your only real weakness , man . You may be fast , you may be strong , and all that other bullshit , but in the end , B ... you 're just too human ! Well , you little shit . You think they scoped out my security system ? I let them in , asshole ! I practically handed them the keys . You heard cue ball , right ? Pretty soon they 're all going to be daywalkers . When that happens , I 'd rather be a pet than cattle . You got me , B ? - What do you think about that ? - Two things- - one ... I 've been onto you since they turned you . And two ... it 's not a dud . Ah , great . I was just starting to like him . Take him down ! We 're going to harvest your blood , every drop of it . Then bone marrow , organs , everything . We 'll find the missing key to creating daywalkers . Now this might hurt a bit . Nice . I wonder ... how many vampires he 's killed with this thing . Not nearly enough , Fritz . Keep talking , honky-tonk . Just makes my sending you to the next world - all the sweeter . - Been there , done that . Do your worst , chickenshit . We 'll settle up after . What else should I find out ? I trusted you- - with my men ; with my will ; with my life . You sent us out there . You sent me to die . Our enemy saved my life twice , and you have used us- - your own children . Make no mistake , Nyssa , those blood ties mean nothing to me when measured against the ascendancy of our race . Who do you think God really favors in the web ? The spider , or the fly ? Nomak . What about him ? He wants revenge ... on the people ... who created him . You may be right . But fortunately for us , he doesn 't know this location . Now ... he does . What the fuck ? Come on , kid . Don 't you even think about dying on me . You didn 't give up on me , I won 't give up on you . Come on- - Blade . Blood ... Yeah . Blood . Father ! He 'll never enter here . Father ! Father ! Go on , kid . Go ! Get him ! Get in there ! Hmm . Well ... Like my daddy said before he killed my mom , " You want anything done right , you got to do it yourself . " He also said- - Can you blush ? Hey , kid . I reset the security code . - We 're locked in . - Are you insane ? - He 'll kill us both . - Yes . Isn 't it sad that you die not by the hand of your enemy , but by that of your own children ? Father . Nyssa . Nomak ! Blade , it could end right here . What do you think , huh ? After all , it looks like I 've finished my father 's job . It 's strange . It hurts ... it hurts no more . It won 't be long . I can already feel it burning inside of me . I want to die while I 'm still a vampire . I want to see the sun . By booth number three . Enjoy , man . Are you sure that the girls are live ? Last time I checked . Thank you . A couple of razor blades , just in case ... You didn 't think I forgot about you , did you ?

 MAN : We 're all just floating . KAYLEE : You couldn 't possibIy- - SIMON : No , I wish I was Iying . I just , you know , we 'd all just made surgeon . That was it . We were the elite . The world was ours , you know . KAYLEE : So you had to be naked ? Naked , yes . And on top of the statue of Hippocrates . [ GIGGLING ] SIMON : Can you just picture me ? KAYLEE : What , naked ? Oh , well , Iet 's see , I 'm gonna have to conjure up ... . Yeah , that 's gonna be difficult . - So did the Feds come ? - There were no Feds . - until I started singing . - Oh , no ... . - No , this is not- - - What did you sing ? SIMON : This is not funny . This is a morality tale about the evils of sake . I would be there right now . I mean , it was- - It was either- - It was either that or the national anthem . - Reports vary . - You don 't remember any of this ? SIMON : I remember talking the Feds out of telling my father . Or paying the Feds out of telling my father . I get fuzzy on aspects . [ KAYLEE GIGGLING ] So , Iike , never ? well ... ... no. Not ever never ? Some orders allow shepherds to marry , but I follow a narrower path . But , I mean , you still got the urge ? They don 't cut it off or nothing ? No . I 'm more or less intact . I just direct my energy elsewhere . You mean , Iike masturbating ? I hope you 're not thinking of taking orders yourself . JAYNE : Yeah , that 'II be the day . I got stupid . The money was too good . I don 't give half a hump if you 're innocent or not . So where does that put you ? It ain 't impossible . Saint Jayne . It 's got a ring to it . I 'm just trying to remember how many miracles you 've performed . I once hit a guy from 500 yards with a bent scope . - Don 't that count upstairs ? - Oh , it 'II be taken into consideration . You made that sound kind of ominous . [ WAVES CRASHING ] I put out waves to some old acquaintances . I may even find something in New melbourne if you need the shuttle . MALCOLM : I 'II only be there to pick up cargo . The only thing you 're gonna find there is fish and fish-reIated activities . So unless you got the overwhelming urge to gut sturgeon , and who hasn 't ? But it 's a layover point for almost every planet . I couId ... . I just don 't want to draw this out . MALCOLM : Have you decided when you 'II tell the others ? I ... . No . - I appreciate your not saying anything . - well , I don 't , so make up your mind . I 'm a big girl . Just tell me . None of it means a damn thing . [ WAVES CRASHING ] [ WAVES STOP CRASHING ] It 's just an object . It doesn 't mean what you think . - Stay calm ! SIMON : You know that 's ... . INARA : Stop yelling . That 's gonna make it worse . MALCOLM : River . Sweetheart . Put it down . SIMON : Where did you get that ? INARA : Don 't yell . It was in my hand . I 'm not mad , just let me- - Thank you . fully loaded , safety off . This here is a recipe for unpleasantness . - Does she understand that ? - She understands . She doesn 't comprehend . I 'm glad we 've made that distinction . No touching guns , okay ? No touching . - River-- river : It 's getting very , very crowded ! Thought she was on the mend . Her medications are erratic . There 's not one that her system can 't eventually break down and- - If I want a Iot of medical jargon , I 'II talk to a doctor . - You are talking to a doctor . - Yeah . Okay . My point is , it could have been you she might have shot . The doctor , as you just made note of . And who exactly could fix you ? Not nobody . We 're deep in space , corner of No and Where . You take extra care with her ... ... because we 're very much alone out here . little River gets more colorful by the moment . What 'II she do next ? Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair . It 's a tossup . I hope she does the soup thing . It 's always a hoot , and we don 't all die from it . - That poor kid . - Yeah . She 's definitely got- - - Funny . - Something wrong ? I 'm getting a weird heat bounce off our wake . - Engine flux ? - Sensors probably got turned around- - MALCOLM : She can only get in there if she knows the combination . I don 't leave loaded guns around . She got her hands on your hardware . Suppose she took up something with huII-piercing bullets . bullets are soft lead . Even Vera could barely breach the hull ... ... and she 's the best I got . Now ... ... let 's move the conversation in " not Jayne 's fault " direction . I didn 't make her crazy . hell , I didn 't even want her on the ship . Is that the direction you want this conversation to go in ? Just don 't want to take a lashing for something I ain 't the cause of . ZOE : Where is River now ? - Her room . Which I 'm thinking of bolting from the outside . That 's a little extreme . Remember her coming at me with a butcher 's knife ? - Wacky fun . - You wanna go , little man ? only if it 's someplace with candlelight . I don 't think she 'd harm anyone . JAYNE : Butcher 's knife ! - Anyone we can 't spare . As far as we know , she 's never even picked up a gun before . KAYLEE : That ain 't so . KayIee , you got something to say ? Okay , KayIee , why don 't you speak your piece ? It was when the captain and Wash got took by Niska . I ain 't like to forget that anytime soon . well , we all went in . Me too . Didn 't make much account of myself , I 'm afraid . I got no problem with you not killing nobody . What 's it to do with River ? She wasn 't in the fight . well , no , she was . I got pinned down , and there were three guys , and I couldn 't ... . And then River comes up . She looks out , sees them all . And they was spread out , you know , had some cover . She only looked for a second , and ... ... took my gun , closed her eyes ... ... killed them . She shot them ? AII three . Dead in an instant . And their eyes still closed . well , that 's ... . You saw it wrong . Not a jot . And it weren 't auto-fire , or luck . She just ... . She just did the math . You understand how that sounds ? She killed them with math . What else could it have been ? You couldn 't have done it , Jayne . Nor you , captain . Nobody can shoot like that that 's a person . So River 's not a person ? KAYLEE : Oh , please , don 't be mad . SIMON : I just want to understand what you 're saying here . I thought River was your friend . KAYLEE : She is ! But , Simon , the way she ... . Right after , she looked at me and she smiled , Iike nothing was wrong . Like we were playing . Scared me . could be she saved your life , KayIee . I 'm aware of that , and I 'm not- - She probably didn 't even know what was going on . Thought it was a game . Later on , explain to me how that 's a comfort . Might have to use some of that math . What we 've got here to deal with is the larger issue . And that larger issue is , we 've got someone onboard this ship ... ... might be a danger to us . Ain 't a question of whether we like her . Some of us have grown attached to River . Kaylee , you have , or you would have spoken sooner . Which , by the by , you should have . I find River pleasant enough myself but she does have an oddness to her . And I ain 't just talking about her proficiency with firearms . The girl knows things . Things she shouldn 't . Things she couldn 't . What , are you saying she 's a witch ? Yes , Jayne . She 's a witch . She has had congress with the Beast . She 's in Congress ? How did your brain even learn human speech ? I 'm just so curious . [ SPEAKS IN GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] This isn 't a joking matter . This is about our lives and River 's . MALCOLM : Thank you . She 's deeply intuitive . It 's true that sometimes- - I don 't think she 's intuitive , doctor . I think she 's a reader . - Psychic ? - Is that even remotely possible ? You tell me . You 've been studying what they 've done to her . well , they 've definitely altered the way she reacts to things . Even the way she perceives . But I 'm not- - Psychic , though ? That sounds like something out of science fiction . - You live in a spaceship , dear . - So ? Back up a second . Are you saying she really reads minds ? Or near enough . Am I alone thinking along these lines ? No . well , I don 't like the idea of someone hearing what I 'm thinking . No one likes the idea of hearing what you 're thinking . The alliance could have any number of uses for a psychic . A psychic . Or an assassin . She 's just a kid . And she just wants to be a kid . I wish it were that simple . Yeah . If wishes were horses , we 'd all be eating steak . - What do we plan to do about this ? - well , that 's the question . I don 't think she 'd ever hurt any of us . Maybe you 're right . I ain 't gonna make a decision till I thought on it a while . It 's late . Let 's get some rest . - Simon ... . - I gotta check on my assassin . Oh , please don 't be mad . I had to say something . I 'm not mad at you . I just ... . She loves this ship . I think it 's more home to her than any place she 's been . What about you ? I mean , I ... . I thought the hospital was home . I was really making a difference there ... ... and embarrassingly large stacks of money . And I couId 've ... . I would be there right now if she hadn 't- - If they had just left her alone . Is it so bad here ? I don 't even know if the captain- - No , I mean ... . Isn 't there anything about this place you 're glad of ? Good night , you two . - I ... . - Don 't . Yeah , I ... . Good night . Don 't let the space bugs bite . Space bugs ? [ GROANS ] [ CLICKING ] River ? River ? [ GASPS ] I Iike this ship . Serenity . She 's good-Iooking . How did you get on ... ? Strains the mind a bit , don 't it ? You think you 're all alone . Maybe I come down the chimney , KayIee . Bring presents to the good girls and boys . Maybe not though . Maybe I 've always been here . What do you want ? That 's a beating heart , isn 't it ? pull off any one of 1 000 parts , she 'II just die . Such a slender thread . You ever been raped ? The captain is right down that hallway . He can hear you . The captain 's locked in his quarters . They all are . There 's nobody can help you . Say it . There 's nobody can help me . I 'm gonna tie you up now . And you know what I 'm gonna do then ? I 'm gonna give you a present . Get rid of a problem you 've got . And I won 't touch you in any wrong fashion , nor hurt you at all . unless you make some kind of ruckus . You throw a monkey wrench into my dealings in any way ... ... your body is forfeit . It ain 't nothing but a body to me ... ... and I can find all unseemly manner of use for it . Do you understand ? Yes . Turn around and put your hands behind your back . Oh ... . Now tell me , KayIee , where does River sleep ? hello ? [ BANGING ] SIMON : River ? [ GRUNTS ] Dr. Tam , why don 't you sit yourself down . - I 'd rather die standing . - well , the intention is not for you to die . The warrant doesn 't specify a particular need for you to be alive , but ... . Where 's your sister ? Are you alliance ? - Am I a lion ? - What ? I don 't think of myself as a lion . You might as well , though . I have a mighty roar . - I said " alliance . " - Oh . I thought ... . - No , I was ... . - That 's weird . - Where 's your sister ? - I don 't know . Who do you work for ? - This is her room . - Yes . - It 's empty . - I know . So is it still her room when it 's empty ? Does the room , the thing , have purpose ? Or do we ... ? - What 's the word ? - I really can 't help you . The plan is to take your sister . Get the reward , which is substantial . " Imbue , " that 's the word . - So you 're a bounty hunter ? - No , that ain 't it at all . - Then what are you ? - I 'm a bounty hunter . I 'm named early . I 'm known to some . Been tracking you since the Feds were tipped off on ariel . - She sleep with anybody ? - River ? Yeah . She grapple with any of the crew ? May be in their quarters . No . Maybe she does and you don 't know about it . This is insane . I 'm not gonna help you find her , in any case . I think this is very pretty . I Iike the weight of it . I thought the intention was not to kill me . You 're missing the point . The design of the thing is functional . The plan is not to shoot you . The plan is to get the girl . If there 's no girl , then the plan , well , is like the room . You are gonna help me look for her . I don 't think my last act in this ' verse is gonna be betraying my sister . You 're gonna help me . Because every second you 're with me is a chance to turn the tables ... ... to get the better of me . Maybe you 'II find your moment . Maybe I 'II slip . Or you refuse to help me ... ... I shoot your brain out and I go upstairs and spend some time ... ... violating the little mechanic I got trussed up in the engine room . I take no pleasure in the thought , but she will die weeping if you cross me . You 're out of your mind . That 's between me and my mind . Let 's start with these rooms . He 's not killed . Be a while before he comes to , but he 'II mend . How much a part of your plan dictated the need of beating up a shepherd ? That ain 't a shepherd . She wouldn 't come in here anyway . She hates this room . You see , early ... ... the people you 're planning to sell her to cut up her brain in a lab like this . Tortured her . A teenaged girl . - Not some bandit , just an innocent- - - Ever been shot ? - No . - You ought to be shot . Or stabbed . Lose a leg . To be a surgeon , you know . Know what kind of pain you 're dealing with . They make psychiatrists get psychoanaIyzed ... ... before they can get certified ... ... but they don 't make a surgeon get cut on . That seem right to you ? Come on out , River . The nice man wants to kidnap you . EARLY : Shh . I Iike the way the walls go out . Gives you an open feeling . firefly 's a good design . people don 't appreciate the substance of things . Objects in space . people miss out on what 's solid . It 's not your moment , doctor . Is that the companion shuttle ? Yes . We 'II try the empty first . Then we 'II pay her a visit . Her room 's not saying a damn thing . hold it . This is pointless , you know that ? Two hundred thousand seems fairly pointed to me . Money like that , I couId retire . Not that I would . - What 's life without work ? INARA : Serenity 's a smuggling ship . I 've been here a year . I couldn 't name where she might hide . EARLY : I don 't have a year . Your sister 's becoming a real annoyance . I feel for you . I 'm not gonna waste my time threatening you ... ... because I think you believe I will kill people if someone upsets my plan . I 'm gonna seal you in , though . You just sit . You can still walk away from this . I know you 're tired . Don 't go visiting my intentions . Don 't ever . Man is stronger by far than woman ... ... yet only woman can create a child . Does that seem right to you ? AII right . That 's all the hide-and-seek I got time for . I know you 're on this ship , little girl . So here 's how this goes . Show yourself and finish this exchange , or your brother 's brains 'II be flying . You understand . I 'm sort of on the clock here . It 's frustrating . RIVER : You 're wrong , Early . No , dumpling . I will shoot your brother if you- - Wrong about River . River 's not on the ship . They didn ' t want her here , but she couldn ' t make herself leave so she melted . Melted away . They didn ' t know she could do that , but she did . EARLY : I 'm not sure I take your meaning there . RIVER : I 'm not on the ship . I 'm in the ship . I am the ship . - River ... . - River 's gone . Then who exactly are we talking to ? You 're talking to Serenity . And Early Serenity is very unhappy . Kaylee . River ! You 're afraid . He tied me up . - I don 't know where he came from . - It 's okay . You 're gonna be okay . I told him where you were . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know what else to do . I- - I 'm fine . I need you to do something for me . Gotta be brave . - I 'm tied up . I can 't . - Got tools . Something sharp . Don ' t be scared . I 'm right here . Where 'd she go ? I can 't keep track of her when she 's not incorporeaIIy possessing a spaceship . That 's nonsensical crap . Ain 't nobody can do that . You somewhere on this boat . Somewhere with a ' com , playing games . [ RIVER GIGGLING ] That 's somewhat unsettling . Early . Mr. Jubal Early , bounty hunter . May I call you Jubal ? Ain 't nobody calls me that . Your mother does . Oh , sorry . Did . She 's gone now . Is that supposed to scare me , bringing up my mother ? You 're a liar . I don ' t think your intentions are honorable . well , no . I 'm a bounty hunter . It 's not generally considered honorable , so much as ... . I Iive by a code , though , which I think is worth- - You hurt people . only when the job requires it . Wrong . You 're a bad liar . You crawl inside me uninvited and you hurt my crew . I see everything that passes- - I only hurt people because they keep getting in the way of me finding you . - tell her . - What am I , your advocate ? You are , starting now . He 's really very gentle and fuzzy . We 're becoming fast friends . [ RIVER GIGGLING ] You folks are all insane . well , my sister 's a ship . We had a complicated childhood . Doesn 't anybody care ... ... that I have a finely crafted gun pointed at this boy 's head ? I care . Then you gonna stop me from doing what I don 't want to ? You gonna be smart here , River ? River ? Serenity ? [ GROANS ] MALCOLM : What the hell 's going on here ? RIVER : I need you to do me a favor , captain . MALCOLM : There was a guy . He 's very blurry . You better be careful . How come there 's a guy onboard , and why are you all of a sudden the ship ? - I know you have questions . - That 's why I just asked them . But there isn ' t a lot of time , captain . I need you to trust me . Am I dreaming ? We all are . Don ' t make faces . Are you ready ? EARLY : I just have to think here . These older models have Iocators at all ? Won 't help . With the exception of one deadly midget , this girl is the smallest cargo ... ... I 've ever had to transport , yet by far the most troublesome . Does that seem right to you ? - What did he do ? - Who ? The midget . Arson . little man loved fire . I can take this guy out . RIVER : He 's faster than you . All of you . And he 's wearing armor . What about his face ? Is his face wearing armor ? No touching guns . It 's soon now . Are you ready ? - How do you know what he 's gonna do ? - I 'm very close to him . - He doesn ' t even see it . - Okay , but- - Go now ! You 're not welcome here anymore , Early . Do you think I 'm gonna leave here empty-handed ? I know it . Yeah , well , you know me real well . Wish I didn ' t . You like to hurt folk . It 's part of the job . It 's why you took the job . Power , control , pain . Your mother knew . Signed " the sinner " when she waved goodbye . She 's relieved . Saw darkness in you . You 're not well . You 'II be wanting to shut up now . Big Golden Retriever sitting on the lawn . Never took to you . Smelling you . Your neighbor 's pet . You did things to him . Cleaned up after . Shined and polished . Everything in here gleams . well , I 'II be a son of a whore . You 're not in my mind . You 're on my ship ! [ RIVER LAUGHING ] It 's very interesting , all these buttons . Okay . We 're not touching those , okay ? - How 'd she get on my ship ? - Put the gun away . Okay . I 'm putting it away . No , he 's not . I 'm putting it away ... ... because we 're all reasonable people . Don ' t want to do anything rash fiddling with any dials . You 're not right , early . You 're not righteous . - You 've got issues . - No . Or , yes . I couId have that . You might have me figured out then . Good job . I 'm not 1 00 percent . You talk too much . I 'm flawed in that way . I sometimes go on , it 's been said . It 's okay , early . I 'm going with you . River , what are ... ? I don 't belong . Dangerous , Iike you . Can ' t be controlled . Can ' t be trusted . Everyone can just go on without me and not have to worry . People could be what they wanted to be could be with the people they wanted . could live simple . No secrets . No . I 'II be fine . I 'II be your bounty , JubaI early . And I 'll just fade away . well , finally something goes according to- - Simon ? [ GUNSHOT ] See ? That 's what it feels like . Hang tight , darling . early 's on the move . [ SIMON GRUNTING ] Shh . It 's okay . You made the right move , darling . Best of you to go with old early . You think so ? Some of us feel differently . Permission to come aboard ? You know , you ain 't quite right . It 's a popular theory . Go on , get in there . Give your brother a thrashing for messing up your plan . He takes so much looking after . To the Ieft . Your left . Okay , now , very gently , pull that aside . This is really not my area of expertise , doctor . I tend to be putting these into people more than the other thing . Can I mop your brow ? I 'm at the ready with the fearsome brow mop . You got the bullet . Okay , I 'm just gonna pass out for a minute , but you 're doing great . And we live to fight another day . Any chance that shima lakkoren might survive ? Air he had left , I 'd say his chance would be about one in ... ... a very large number . He knows that play . How 's your lip ? SHEPHERD : I just feel such a fool . JAYNE : AII them years of priest training , taken out by one bounty hunter . SHEPHERD : Don 't get me wrong . I gave him a hell of a fight . JAYNE : Epic , I 'm guessing . They 'II be poems and songs . Just you wait . Least you got some play . I missed every damn thing . KAYLEE : And then his folks come by to fetch him ... ... and it turns out he 's , Iike , 1 4 years old ! I mean , he must 've been some kind of genetic experiment ... ... because I swear this guy was ... . Oh , my daddy whupped me so hard . One of fours . Let 's see you match that . I can win this . I 'm hearing a Iot of talk there , genius . Come on . Show me what you got . Yep . Here I am . subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

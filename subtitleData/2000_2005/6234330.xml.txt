 What are you up to ? Crichton . Yup . What are you doing ? Playin ' a game . Doesn 't seem like much of a challenge . Depends on how you play . You were mumbling ... again . Just thinking . About what ? Something to remember me by , Crichton . Nothing . Crichton , you 've told me yourself that your species isn 't accustomed to being in space for long periods of time . Now I have seen cases of transit madness before , and if you are cracking up ... Aeryn ... I want to know . I 'm fine . I don 't wanna talk about it . The human doesn 't want to talk . What do you mean they 're not back yet ? D 'argo and Chiana are busy , Rygel . What ? They ran out of places to defile up here , so they had to do it in a transport pod ? Unfortunately for them , nothing so enjoyable . They 've learned that organic goods from this region are often contaminated by parasites . So they 're looking for a local cure in case there 's an infestation on Moya . Parasites ? What ... kind ? I don 't have any details yet , but I suppose that 's the price you pay for trading in such a prosperous system . Prosperous ? Is that what you call three planets filled with nothing but miserable mud grubbing farmers ? Our parasite problems are solved ! Rygel 's decided to leave us then , has he ? Not likely . We don 't even know if we have a parasite problem . Well , that 's what " this " little guy 'll tell us . What is that ? It 's a Vork . Cute , huh ? We had some problems with our translator microbes and the local merchants . But from what we can gather , this little fella hones in on one specific parasite and eradicates it . Aww , look ! He 's smelling something ! The vendor told us about this ship that was infested . The parasites killed everyone on board . Over two hundred people . And all they left behind were these ... these ... these cocoons or ... . Cocoons . Eggs or something . If the parasites are that dangerous , we should jettison the food and solve the problem before it starts . When you see what this little fella can do ... Come back here ! Yup , that 's impressive . Goodness , let the big dog eat ! He 's a Cinderella boy . Oh my , Bob . This is a ... this is a big chance for the kid from the Uncharted Territories . He 's about ... two feet off the green here on the eighteenth , two strokes off the lead . Question is , will he chip or will he use the putter ? Sparky ? Yo Ryg ' , that you ? Rygel ? My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Nah , I 'm tellin ' you , whatever it was , - One of Rygel 's tricks ... it was going through the food . Have you considered the possibility that you just saw Rygel ? - Hoarding food . - It wasn 't Rygel . Well maybe it was one of those parasites . We never did get a good description of them . - You said you fired at it while it was in this compartment , right ? - Yeah . Well , there 's no other way out of there . Where did it go ? I don 't know ! Get away from there ! That food belongs to " me " ! That " food " is for all of us ! What is that foul odor ? It 's Vork urine . Would you like a whiff ? What 's a Vork ? It is a predator that kills parasites ! Chiana 's with it , it 's hunting right now . Whatever it is , it better stay away from " my " food . Hey , maybe that 's what I saw ... a Vork . It was about this size , naked , with a face like this . No , no , mine was more like Tandoori chicken . Pilot , can you spare the DRD 's for a search ? Of course , Commander . Zhaan ? Zhaan ! Did you get the cage ? Uh , yeah . But I don 't think the Vork likes it very much . Well , what does he like ? Uh , well so far , uh everything ! Uh , parasites . Come on little ... what 's his name ? Well I couldn 't just name him , Zhaan . He 's a free spirit ! Well you could appreciate that . While I believe it 's wrong to imprison any living creature there are always exceptions . No ! This thing should be out hunting . You can play with it , later . Did it look like I was playing ? Yes . This thing needs to earn its keep . Frelling bit me ! That little ... . Alright then , what about the access shafts ? The Drs are searching those areas . But so far there 's no evidence of any creature like the one you 've described . I 'm beginning to doubt whether we 'll find anything at all . Why ? Officer Sun mentioned that you 'd been ... distracted lately . She believes it 's possible that you broke into Rygel 's food cache and fired at an imaginary enemy , while playing some sort of ... game . It 's golf . I 'm ... would you believe it 's possible that Aeryn doesn 't know what the hell it is that she 's talkin ' about ? I have never known her to exaggerate . Have you , Crichton ? Crichton ? Yotz ! Rygel ! What the hell are you doin ' ? It 's a cargo bay ! I was checking my cargo ! I was told we had parasites on board ! Now would you like to explain why you were trying to kill me ? Look I ... I thought you were that ... thing that I ... saw earlier . Sorry . Little Vork thingy . Little Vork . Dargo ! The Vork got away from me ! Again ? You have to stay with it ! Easy for you to say ! It hasn 't stopped running around the ship since it got here . That 's how it hunts ! Well , yeah , I know , it 's just that I 'm starting to get a little tired of following it around . Listen , if we do have a parasite on board , we need to know what it looks like . Which means ... Follow the Vork . Fine ! You follow it . Fine , you follow the Vork . Get ... .. off ... ... .. my bed . Chiana . Chiana ! Get off my bed ! D 'argo ! Yes . That filthy little creature of yours is down in my quarters and it 's using them as a toilet ! Among ... other things ! It has to learn the environment before it can find the parasites . The only parasite we have is right here , and if you don 't come and get it I 'm gonna flush it out an airlock ! You 're as bad as Chiana ! Just leave it alone and let it do its job . D 'argo , I think it 's picked up a scent or something . Don 't let it out of your sight ! Rygel ? Aeryn ! Where are you ? Tier seven junction , I 've lost the Vork . Dren . Where was it heading ? What does it matter ? This is pointless . Do you know how dangerous these parasites are ? They suck the life out of their prey and leave nothing but a desiccated husk ! These parasites are a fantasy ! They 're stories to frighten you and Chiana into purchasing a useless animal ! Fine , fine , fine , I will find it myself ! Good , yes , waste your own time . Where ? Was ? It heading ? Towards the maintenance bay . D 'argo . D 'argo ! Not now Chiana , I 'm looking for the Vork ! I 'm in the maintenance bay and uh ... there 's a ... there 's some kind of creature ... . right in front of me . Chiana ! Hurry ! Get out of there ! Now ! Yeah , I would if I could ! Crichton , Aeryn ! maintenance bay , now ! Chiana , do something ! You do something ! Okay , easy . We 're ... we 're not gonna hurt you , okay ? So ... so ... Now , slug him ! We 're on the way , don 't panic ! I think it 's a little too late for that ! Chiana ! - D 'argo ! - Chiana ! Oh come on , Luxan , come on . You must not die . Chiana . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah , I 'm fine . D 'argo ! ... . Rygel , what the hell are you doin ' ? He wasn 't breathing . And I 'm fine too , thanks for asking . D 'argo ! That creature you saw ... the parasite ... it 's real . Yeah , I know that . I 'm delighted you 've been vindicated Crichton , but I 'll be even happier when you kill the frelling thing ! - Woah , woah , woah , woah ... - D 'argo ! D 'argo , what 's wrong ? - Hold 'im down ! Hold him ... - What 's happening ? - I don 't know ! - What 's wrong ? Hold him down ! Get Zhaan ! Zhaan ! Get down here ! D 'argo ! Zhaan ! I don 't understand what 's wrong with him . You cleansed the wound , you said there were no internal injuries . I 've done all I can do for now , Chiana . But he appears to have some kind of secondary infection . Like what ? Like that 's what I 'm trying to determine . Well try faster ! I don 't need to be a healer to see that D 'argo 's getting worse . But you do need to be a healer to make him better . Now shut up and let me get back to work , or leave . Crichton ? D 'argo 's not so good . You found the creature ? No sign of it yet . It 's like it just disappeared . Hey , Aeryn ! We just found your Vork , Chiana . Well , that thing 's useless . Maybe not. it was heading for the Maintenance Bay when you were attacked . I think it knew what was there . Yeah , but isn 't the Vork supposed to kill the parasite , not just point it out ? And you think this miniscule creature could kill something that could incapacitate D 'argo ? No . But we could use it to flush the parasite out . It could be our bird dog . That can be your ... uh , you bring it , I 'll just uh ... ... . I hate critters ! You wanna tell me something ? Uh , D 'argo ... . you 're in no condition for sex . Yeah . Might kill me , huh ? By Kahaylin ! What 's wrong ? D 'argo 's been poisoned ! There 's an alien toxin in his blood stream and it 's killing him . Wh - y - y - you can make an antidote , can 't ya ? I ... I don 't know , I can ... I can try . Next . Next . Show me another one . I 'll need a venom sample from the creature , John . But most natural venoms decompose rapidly when the creature dies . We can 't afford to take that risk , so it 's very important that you capture the creature alive and quickly . We 're working as fast as we can , Zhaan . Pilot , is it possible that this critter has camouflage ability ? Have you tried switching the DRDs to heat and acoustic mode ? Yes . And without success . The creature seems quite adept at avoiding surveillance . Show me cargo bay three . You 'll never see it coming , John . Yes . What 's going on ? Get me out of here ! Pilot has modified the energy fields of Moya 's neural clusters . So your cells will be fortified , they 'll give you strength . Why ... why 's it so hard to breathe ? The parasites venom appears to be designed to ... paralyze the nerves and muscles of its prey . Your hearts and lungs have been affected , D 'argo . You 're early , Rygel . I 'm not dead yet ! But when I do die , Chiana 's gonna get all of my possessions ! You always expect the worst of me . Is it unthinkable that I might be here to offer the gift of my ... company to a shipmate in need ? Yes ! Are you afraid to be alone , Rygel ? I knew you 'd be here , that didn 't frighten me . Why should blessed solitude ? Right . Now . How about ... this way ? This way . Aeryn , any luck with the Vork yet ? Oh , yes . So far , he 's lead me to the cockpit of your module , a pool of amnexus fluid , and a pile of food cube crumbs . How 's D 'argo ? Poison 's working on him . Zhaan says it 's slow , but ... steady . No ! No biting ! Listen , we 'll find the parasite and I 'll shoot it . Aeryn , no shooting ! That 's what the sleep gas is for . I know that ! Woah ! You 've got something ? Well apparently the Vork thinks it does , it 's getting very hard to control ! Listen to me . I 'm gonna let you out , so not too far , and not too fast . Is that clear ? What was that ? The DRDs have located the creature . Pilot ! It 's in the air lock above you , Zhaan ! The creature ! It 's coming for us ! I 'm trying to seal off the tier to keep it confined . Pilot ! Crichton ! Anybody ! It 's moved out of the air shaft ! Tier four ! I 've lost contact with a DRD ! Nooooooooo ! Frell ! Where 'd it go ? Dammit Chiana ! I don 't trust Aeryn to wing that thing , and she 's a good shot ! We have to get it into a confined space where the gas grenade can do some good ! Well what did you expect me to use ? Harsh language ? That was a warning shot ! Yeah , well ten is more than a warning ! Pilot , we lost it ! I know what I 'm doing , okay ? I didn 't ask you to come along and I don 't ... Chiana , go back to D 'argo and give him a reason to live . And do what ? What , sit by him and watch him die ? This is the only way I know how to help him . The creature is on tier three ! Hammond side and moving rapidly ! It 's heading for command ! Pilot , seal off the exits ! Done ! The creature has no way out ! Do it ? Armed . Ready . Pilot , open sesame . It couldn 't have gotten out . Could it ? Shut up and keep searching . Not now . Crichton . What 's the matter ? Nothing , I 'm fine . Things gotta be around here somewhere . Chiana . Aww , frell . The Vork . Must 've chased the creature in here . So where is it ? Why don 't you show us ? Come on , show us the parasite . Grenades ! That thing was the Vork all along ? Wait a minute . You sayin ' ... the Vork is the parasite ? The only thing I know for certain is that you brought it on board . How was I supposed to know ? Girls . Quit the sniping ' . Zhaan needs a venom sample . Alright , what do you mean there 's no venom ? I can 't find any ! There 's no trace of any toxin whatsoever in any of the samples I took from that creature ! You must have missed something , then . I checked down to it 's hair follicles . I tried every technique I know . I 'm sure that didn 't take long . Shut up , Rygel . There has to be another explanation . Perhaps it 's only poisonous in it 's other form . No , it attacked D 'argo in it 's present form . Besides , it bit me when it was small and I 'm fine . And the poison had to come from somewhere . Pilot , how long would it take us to get back to where we bought this damn thing ? At maximum speed , Moya could reach the planet in less than thirty - two arns . D 'argo won 't make it . His respiration is failing . The field in the neural cluster won 't sustain him much longer . The thing that attacked me ... was the Vork . Zhaan 's getting a venom sample from it , now . You 're gonna be fine . Don 't lie to me . I brought the frelling thing on board . This is all my fault , D 'argo . You didn 't bring him here . We both did . Alright , riddle me this . Because we think we may have parasites on board , we get a Vork , cause someone tells us Vorks kill parasites . Then all of a sudden , this other critter shows up , this Ewok gone bad , bites D 'argo , poisons him . Yeah ? So we capture the parasite , and then surprise , the parasite and the Vork are the same thing . But , neither one of them is poisonous . So , for ten thousand dollars and the Caribbean cruise , what poisoned D 'argo ? Something else must have . Yes . You 're suggesting there 's another creature on board ? Yes . The real parasite . What if the Vork is working as advertised ? It 's hunting the parasite , but it 's doing it in two different forms . Smaller faster form for tracking , a larger , more powerful form for attack . Exactly . Why did it attack Chiana and D 'argo ? I don 't know . Maybe they scared it . Threatened it somehow . You know , D 'argo has that effect on everything . Even if this real parasite exists , which I 'm still not convinced it does , we have no idea what it is . Is it an insect , a micro - organism , another creature like this ? I don 't know . Why don 't you ask it ? Oh , that 's very good Crichton . I know my microbe translators are working , cause as derranged as it always is , I do understand what you 're saying . But this creature can only grunt and growl , it cannot talk . No , Aeryn , this is a good idea . Why don 't we see if we can get the Incredible Vork here to understand us ? D 'argo is dying , you got a better idea , lay it on me . Alright Pilot , shoot 'im up . Injecting translator microbes . Hey ! Over here , listen up . You understand me ? We just want to talk to you . This is a waste of time Crichton , translator microbes don 't take this long to work . Let 's take it to Zhaan , she can dissect it , see if she missed something . Dissect it ? Yeah , I say we kill it . Aeryn , it understands what you 're saying . Take it back . Take it back . Hello . I 'm sorry . I don 't want to kill you . That was ... . terrible ! That was ... . no one ... look , Lassie here is trying to communicate with us . Yeah ? I don 't understand you . Officer Sun ! I believe it 's asking ... why . Pilot , you understand him ? Somewhat . Because of my bond with Moya , I am accustom to non - verbal communication . While I don 't believe this creature has language in a true sense ... it seems to be expressing itself in a mixture of simple concepts , sensations and instinctual reactions . Keep translating . Why ... . pain ... me ? Well , we hurt you , because you hurt us . Why ... did you attack D 'argo ? Our friend . Friend . ... Attack Defend ... . D 'argo attacked you first ? Friend . Friend ? It keeps repeating " friend " . In the command . It showed us it could change shapes . It wasn 't trying to hurt us . No . What do you want ? Bad ... . danger ... . here . There 's a parasite on board ? Are you the parasite ? The answer to that is no ! Who is gonna say yes to that ? That is no ! Clarifying ! Can - can you help us find the parasite ? Hunt ... the bad . Kill ... . the bad . Free . Kill the bad . Right . So you want us to free you , so you can kill the parasite ? That 's a better question , clarification . And that 's a yes . Do you trust it ? I don 't know . We could have it describe the parasite to us and we could find it ourselves . Who knows how long that could take . D 'argo doesn 't have that much time to spare . Alright . Hey , little fella ! We 're gonna roll the dice . But you make one wrong move , I will shoot you . You understand shoot ? Little bolts of light . Oooooooowch . Here we go again . Pilot , can you dial down Moya 's atmospheric scrubbers ? It might enhance whatever this little guy 's sniffin ' . Reducing scrubbers , now . Crichton , have you taken leave of your senses ? I don 't expect much from Aeryn , but you ... Relax Sparky , we 're on it . I saw what it did to D 'argo . If it comes near me , I 'll kill it , I swear ! Lock yourself in your room and do whatever the hell it is you do in there by yourself . Crichton . Hey ! Hey ! We had a deal ! You were supposed to lead us to it ! Pilot , I demand that you fuel a transport pod and make it ready for departure , this microt ! Rygel , I told you , my DRDs are occupied ! I cannot help you now ! Help ! Anybody ! Help ! Rygel ? Rygel ? Are you there ? Rygel ! It 's not after you Rygel , it 's after the parasite . Just keep moving , get out of the area ! It 's closing in ! I can hear it ! Crichton ! You said I 'd be safe ! You said ... . Rygel , don 't move . Rygel is your friend . Rygel , tell him your his friend . Yotz . Kill it ! No , friend . Kill It ! Rygel , it 's probably not after you . It 's just lookin ' for a gopher , man . Go slow . Kill it ! Kill it ! Kill it ! No , get off him ! Oh , no , Rygel ! Get off of him , now ! Help me ! I ... . Can 't - can 't ... move . So cold . Body feels broken . Rygel , you 're going into shock . Zhaan says you have internal injuries . Your fault . You let that thing do this to me . Sparky ... Sparky just ... shut up . Try and stay calm . He 's been poisoned . What ? There were massive traces of toxins in Rygel 's wound . The same compounds I found in D 'argo . Zhaan , we had the Vork in our hands . You - you said it wasn 't poisonous . I made a mistake . If I bring it in dead , any possibility that you could make an anti - venom ? Well , it 's possible . There 's nothing I can do for Rygel and D 'Argo without it . one way or the other , you 're gettin ' it , okay ? Yeah . Can he talk ? I don 't know . How you doin ' ? Find ... My son . Find my son . We 'll find him together . You take care of him . Blood . I knew ... we hit it . Yeah , hide from me now , friend . When we see him , he 's mine . Well see . What the frell was that for ? It was nothin ' . Just clearing ' my head . Crichton ! You see any blood ? No . Alright ... That way . Aeryn ! No - no - no - no , we are not splitting up ! We 're running out of time . We don 't have another choice . Woah ! Woah , woah , woah , that thing just gave us the slip ! Why would it come back for us unless it was leading us ? Into a trap , what else ? Right . As long as we both know ! Better get it back to Zhaan . Aeryn . What is that ? Can you say ... cocoon ? Chiana said the parasites leave cocoons behind . Aeryn . It lead us here to see this . Holy body snatchers , start talkin ' ! That frelling thing ... went through my mouth ... . could barely frelling breathe ! Its drones , pouring out of me . Through my ears , nose , my pores , every frelling hole in my body ! Fo - fo - form this cocoon around me to feed to it 's frelling offspring ! Imagine me , food for something else ! Oh ! It took my shape ! And then it ... How do I know you 're Rygel ? Where are you going ? Zhaan , get out of there , now ! It 's not Rygel , it 's the parasite ! Ryge ? Rygel ! Ryge ? Cover me ! What the frell is that ? Sorry about the mess . That parasite was hiding in a crate of marjoules I was inspecting in the cargo bay ! A hideous experience ! It was actually feeding off my essence ! My thoughts ! And it would have done the same to all of you . I remember Rygel ... the other one ... standing over me after I was wounded . That parasite was gonna use you next . Why didn 't it ? I suspect it tried , but D 'argo 's reaction to the venom was so strong , it didn 't have time to complete it 's task . How could you all have been so stupid to let that thing fool you ? It was a perfect copy of you , Rygel . Perfect . Perhaps to undiscerning observers like yourselves . Fortunately , that courageous Vork was here to rescue me . Pilot ? He ... says he 's happy Is there anything we can do to help ? don 't think the creature understands the concept . End . End . He knows his ... time is near . I am so ... .. so sorry . Crichton . When we were hunting , you uh ... almost blew my head off . That was a bad shot , even for you . Yeah . What 's your point ? What were you firing at ? Really . I 've been , uh ... having these , well , I wouldn 't exactly call them hallucinations I 've been having these ... flashes of Scorpius . Flashes ? Like memories ? No , they 're not memories . It 's more like he 's talking to me . Have you ever been in a ... in a crowded room , and everybody 's talking all at the same time , so you can 't hear anybody , and suddenly someone says your name , and then ... like crystal , you hear every word they say . No matter how far away they are , it 's like they 're talking only to you . What is Scorpius saying to you ? He says he 's gonna get me . He says he already has , I just don 't know it yet . Why didn 't you kill him when you had the chance ? I tried . Tried ... but I couldn 't . Something stopped me . Something inside . Crichton , if you need help ... I 'll ask ... just like you do . Aeryn , don 't worry . I 'm not gonna lose my mind . It 's all I 've got left . All right . You 'll never see it coming , John . When the trap closes , it 'll be too late . You think ? Checkmate . You lose . That , um ... wasn 't the trap that I meant .

 Hey , fellas , knock it off . I 'm trying to work here . Knock it off ! That 's enough . Crais ! Where is it ? Crais ! Yo , Captain . Where is it ? What have you done ? I 've taken propulsion off-line to optimize the energy transfer rate . I 'm hoping that it will ease his pain and speed the recovery process . Very elegant . You seem to have an intuitive grasp of Talyn 's subsystems . Well , it just felt right . It is more than right . I can sense his easing . Have you given any thought to my previous proposal ? Talyn , open the door ! Crais ! I know you 're in there ! Playtime is over . Open the damn door ! Meet me later in my quarters . There is much more for us to discuss . Talyn , open the door . Hey , you wanna mess with me ? What seems to be the problem ? Keeping the DRDs over my head working 24-7 , so I can 't sleep . Repairs to Talyn . All the doors , locked . The shower ice-cold , so I 'm freezing the boys off . John , what are you talking about ? It 's not really a problem but you do not mess with my stuff . Where 's Wynonna ? - What ? Wy ... non ... na . - His pulse pistol . - My gun . Well , maybe Rygel came ... Rygel and Stark have been on recon for more than a day . John ... Don 't call me John ! Crichton , then . Are you accusing me of theft ? Talyn , you 've seen them both naked . Perhaps you can tell us who 's bigger . Talyn ... In addition to their current duties , please have the DRDs keep an eye out for Mr. Crichton 's pulse weapon . He seems to have mislaid it . Will there be anything else ? Yeah . Hang a left before we hit that moon . What moon ? - Small one , dead ahead . Our orbital plan is well clear of this planet 's moons . How could we miss it ? Might have been below the ring plane . Talyn , get a fix on all orbital objects . It 's changing course and speed . Accelerating . Talyn , remain calm . Main cannon is arming . Aeryn , bring propulsion back on line . Working on it . 20 microts . Talyn , focus on propulsion . That 's no moon . Talyn , focus on propulsion ! That 's a budong ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Aeryn , propulsion ! Should be on line ! It 's totally black out there . This big guppy just locked us in . Talyn , cease fire ! Officer Sun . Try and override the weapons . Talyn , you will desist . It 's not working . Obviously , we hit something . The main cannon is out . It 's damaged . And maneuvering jets are firing . No , Talyn ! No , do not panic ! You 're costing us vital time ! Talyn , listen to me . Focus on a single point with your senses . Align yourself with that point and block out all other distractions . Well done , Talyn . What do we know about budongs ? - Next to nothing . Live ones are exceedingly rare . We 're still moving . We 're caught in some sort of electromagnetic current , and we 're moving ... Down . We 're going down . We 're being swallowed . We 're moving down . Talyn , set a course against the current . Officer Sun , options ? We are incapable of Starburst . Can we shoot our way out ? No . The main cannon is dead . We are flying in the dark , and we are still losing ground to this current . Down . Do we wanna be going down ? We have no notion of which way is up or which way is down . Yo , Jonah , we have been swallowed ! That is down , and I , for one , do not want to be budong chow . You will limit your remarks to something useful or I will ... - No , Crais ! - Or what ? ! He 's right . John is right . Drop anchor . Anchor ? - Yes , anchor ! No , Talyn . But only slightly stupid . It might buy us time . Officer Sun , take Crichton get suited for space . In the armory you 'll find a case of Taks . - Taks ? Use the hamman side Access Chamber . Mooring points are located on the hull ... - Outside . Yes sir , I have it . Dropping anchor . Tak-five torpedoes . Handheld . Fusion-bonded rhenium claws . Stick , never let go . Cables attach to the rear . So we 're going to use this high-grade hardware like a mooring harpoon ? Unless you have a better idea . It was my idea . But will it work ? Well , the cables are iridium alloy . As long as we hit bone , we should hold fast . Good . I must be smarter than I look . That would be easy . All right . You know , I 'd be happy to swap jobs , come back in there and work the mooring control panel . Forget about it , you can 't even operate door controls . There 's a reason for that . Do it . Damn ! Your twin got the brains ? No , Crais . He 's trying to make a point . If I may interrupt ... Damn . Open channel . Officer Sun this current is pulling us at 1.2 metras a microt . Almost there . You ready ? Do it . Do ... not ... argue . All right , we don 't have visual yet . Wall range is closing . Zero-point-five metras . I can 't see anything yet . I need visual . I need to be able to see the ribs . Point one ... Still nothing . Pitch black . Coulda woulda shoulda brought a flashlight . Whoa ! Navigating against this current is proving to be somewhat difficult . Don 't know yet . Soft flesh ! We missed the bone ! Not gonna hold ! Talyn , reverse jets . Release the cable . Too late ! Get down ! Reload . Got it ! Crais , I 'm going to go for a second shot . Talyn , back to the wall ! Set ! - Still no visual . Talyn , slower . There it is . Go , go , go . Come on ! Crais , stabilize the frelling ship ! We 're holding . Swinging towards the wall . What are you doing ? That one held . Making sure . Door ! Crais , third Tak away ! Whose stupid idea was this , anyway ? Yours . What do you mean , they 're not here ? How can you frell up a simple rendezvous ? They 're just not here . Not one of you deficients can properly read a chart . Right . Let 's call the frelniks . Remember Aeryn 's mother ? Aeryn 's mother , Retrieval Squad ? ! Yes , well , she 's out there , and she 's looking for us . Radio silence keeps us hidden and alive . If those toeskas have left us , after all I 've done for them ... It can 't be . - What ? What the yotz are you looking at ? That lump ? That lump is a budong ! What are you doing ? ! Shutting everything down ! Stop being a welnitz ! We can just fly around it . Budongs are harmless , aren 't they ? They 're a frelling shipping hazard ! Our ship 's energy fields make us electromagnetic candy . I 've never heard anyone say that . That 's because they 're all dead ! Dead ? ! We 're flying out of here . No ! No , the power stays off ! Off ! Off ! Off ! Off ! Off ! I am the eater not the eatee ! Can we please restart the Pod now ? Cables are holding . Yes . Good . It was well done . By everyone . It 's warm in here . Aeryn , uh , there 's something we need to discuss . How to get out of this animal . Indeed . Crichton will be up here shortly . What we have to discuss does not concern him . I have engaged privacy mode and I wish to speak solely with you . Crichton , meet ... my quarters . Crais , your comms are fritzing . Where ? Meet me in my quarters . Quarters . Because of what has passed between us , I wanted to wait ... for you to make up your own mind in your own time , but ... events have led us to a new situation . Crais ! No , of course , not here . Tell me he 's got some pumps in the closet , or inflatable Scorvian or Wynonna . PK vid chip . Home movies ? Oh , I really shouldn 't . Well , you can have anything you want . Anything . Aeryn Sun . Are you offering yourself ? Take what you want , Crais , and I won 't stop you . Listen , Crais , I 'm not prepared to remain onboard Talyn ... under these circum ... - Let me finish . Perhaps it would be best for , uh ... Perhaps it would be best for you to see me as I am . Sorry I 'm late . What did I miss ? We were just discussing how best to resolve our ... predicament . Really ? Mm-hmm . - Yes . Yes , Talyn has completed his scan of the budong . Right . Have him whip up a hologram . Not necessary . I have a direct link . We 're moored in the passageway , above the stomach . The budong has too much mass to scan its length successfully . But I believe we can navigate the digestive tract . And what about gizzards , stomach acids , bowel obstructions ? Budong 's are very large structures . And Talyn is designed for intense combat . We should pass through . You know what , I may have swallowed a quarter once or twice , but this seems to me to be a little bit different . Can we not find an alternative , use an alternative orifice ? Blowhole or something ? Not according to our scan . So , according to your scan , assuming this budong is not constipated , you ... you want to fly out the ass ? And-and Talyn can do that ? He 's lik - he 's like , he 's not gonna freak on that plan ? Not with help . What help ? I have decided to take the neural interface with Talyn . The Hand of Friendship ? I see . I thought Talyn was designed for one captain only . We have devised a modified transponder for insertion . Yes , I bet you have . So , you , uh two ... three , you three are , uh , gonna be one . And , uh , anything I can do to help ? At the moment , no , nothing . Exactly . It 's a good plan . Where are you going ? You heard the man . Nothing for me to do . John , wait . Aeryn , you do not want me there . I - I do want you there . Why ? To throw rice ? Forget about it . I 've seen my share of hardware insertion . I 'm not watching . It 's been modified . Yeah , I heard that . Less invasive ; it 's-it 's safer . Yes , it 's new . It 's improved . It 's the Finger of Friendship . $ 19.95 . But wait , kids , there 's more ! What 's the matter with you ? This is the right thing to do . - For who ? For all of us . He needs my help to control Talyn to get us out . Aeryn ... do what you have to do . - I will . Fine , but do not sugarcoat it for me . " Right thing to do , " my ass . And what 's that supposed to mean ? It means that you do things the way you want to , when you want to , with who you want to do them . It 's got nothing to do with what I want . It 's always about what you want ! So yes , walk back in there and let Crais stick a spike in the back of your neck . Listen to me ! - It 'll be a brave new universe , Aeryn . You and Crais . You can finally rejoin that Peacekeeper family you 've been pining for from the moment we met ! You have got this so ... Just don 't pretend to me that it wasn 't what you always wanted ! You finished ? You 're right . I don 't want you there . I know you think I 'm overreacting , but I 'm not . I 'm keeping us alive . A budong is a killing machine , death incarnate . Five cycles I spent on a budong mining operation . Thousands went in ; none came out . And those budongs were dead . This one 's very much alive . What 's that ? My mother sucks what ? ! You heard me . What have you eaten ? ! Oh-oh-uh-oh ... Oh-oh , I think I 'm going to ... Waste funnel 's in the back . I love that trick . Talyn , open the door . Please . Talyn , open the door . Please . Damn ... idiot . There will be pain . It will pass . Try not to control Talyn 's systems too quickly . He was an infant when I joined with him . His will and his ways are much stronger now . Accept him for what he is , and he will welcome you . This is a moment we have long waited for , Aeryn . Are you certain ? He is beyond beautiful . Welcome to our world , Officer Sun . Reach out with his senses . What do you see ? Passageways . Now , focus on a specific object . A door . Good . Now open it . Very good . - Oh ... You learn fast . I 'm tempted to say you 've had enough for one day , but circumstances being what they are ... Imagine you wish to speak with someone . Someone far away . For yotz sake , answer if you can hear , fekkiks ! I did that ? You aligned your comms with long-range scan . As I said , you learn very fast . Hello , out there , anyone ! Come and get me off this stinking Pod ! Dominar , you 're back from recon . Well , of course I 'm back . Where the yotz are you ? We 're somewhat inconveniently tethered inside a budong . Inconvenient ? ! Kiss my mivonks ! Stark , get out here . Stark thinks he 's some kind of budong expert . What ? Oh , you 're loose ! Not half as loose as Chiana . Now , listen . I 've got Talyn on the comms . They 're stuck inside the budong . Inside ? ! No . Not for long . We hope to pass through the digestive track shortly . No ! No , no , no , no , no ! You-you can 't ! Its stomach is an inferno ! Nothing ever comes out of a budong alive ! Talyn ... Its stomach burns at 5,000 klances . Anything that goes in , comes out liquid ore ! - Shut up ! Shut up ! Talyn ! - Calm yourself . No , Talyn ... - Talyn , do not panic ! You 're dead ! You 're dead already ! Stark , do not panic ! We 've lost the Pod signal . Talyn , calm down now ! Aeryn ... - Yes . Is manual override in place for the moorings ? Yes . - Stay at that control . Do not let Talyn release ... Crais ? Talyn , what are you ... What have you done to him ? John , get up here now ! What went wrong ? What happened ? I 'm not sure . Talyn was screaming to be released , and then Crais was trying to reason with him , and he ... Where 's Crais ? I thought he was with you . Talyn , where 's Captain Crais ? He was . Talyn , listen to me . - You didn 't see him leave ? Oh , I was busy . Talyn ? He 's not responding . Houston , we have a problem . Didn 't you take the transponder ? Then use it ! I see him . Access Chamber . He 's trying to release the cables . What ? Why ? I don 't know . Well , can you stop him ? Wait , I ... Yes , I can keep the cables secure , but I ... I can 't leave this override panel . It 's the only advantage I 've got . Fine . I 'll go , you give me your gun . You hold him off . - Listen ... Aeryn , your gun ! Listen , he 's ... Aeryn , get ready to open the Access Chamber door . I 'll try . Crais has released a cable . One more , and we 're budong manure . I can 't stop him , and Talyn is resisting . Aeryn , the door ! I 'll try . Crais ! Get your fat , hairy ass away from the mooring controls . I see you found a weapon . What do you intend to do with it ? Shoot me ? That 's one option . Of course , it is . We 've come full circle , John Crichton . Now you want to kill me . And then don 't make my day . Step away from the panel . I can 't . Talyn won 't let me . He doesn 't believe the Banik . He wants to fly free . You 'll have to shoot me . You see , Crais ? I don 't have to kill you . I wish you had ! Talyn ! Talyn , stop it now ! Kill me ! Aeryn , what the hell is going on ? Talyn , please . Wake up , Bialar . Talyn ? Aeryn knocked him cold . Where is she ? She 's on the bridge , patching up systems . She 'll be here in a little bit . But before she gets here , or Talyn wakes up , you and I are going to have a little Q and A. Put that weapon away . Now , you may be right . I might want to kill you . Ask your questions . You and Talyn . What the hell is going on ? Cybernetic bleed-back . My sores and lesions are physical symptoms . You want to expand on that ? Talyn did that ? In times of stress , our emotions , our desires , can merge . And Talyn can gain a degree of control over me . Resistance causes pain . Clarification ? Talyn controls you ? Crais ... you just set up Aeryn for the same problems you 're having . No . Her transponder is limited . She will not be harmed by Talyn . You cockroach ! The choice was Aeryn 's . Are we finished ? No . I keep hearing that you 've changed . I think , weather changes . And we just keep making the same mistake . Remember why you 're alive . Crais . You all right ? I 'm alive . How 's Talyn ? I , uh , overloaded his beta channel . Knocked him into sleep mode . He may have a mild headache when he comes around in a few arns . You surpass yourself , Officer Sun . I wouldn 't try it again . I don 't think he knew what I was doing this time . Well , we must wake him . The sooner we ... Whoa , whoa , hang on . Don 't we want to figure out what we 're going to do first ? You 're no use to us dead . You rest . I think ... - No , rest ! You 're not going to make it out the door in your current condition . I must get to ... bridge ! Why doesn 't anyone ever listen to me ? I 'm gonna check the cables . Don 't shoot him unless you have to . Is the budong far enough away ? Yes . Is it watching us ? Mm-mm-mm ... no . Then let 's power up and escape while we can . That 's it ! That 's vomit . No , that 's it . Aeryn ! Crichton ! Crais ! I see it . A plan . Aeryn ! Crichton ! Crais ! Why don 't they answer ? 'Cause they 're dead . Give it to me . - What ? You pulled the comms relay circuit . Give it to me . - Get back . They are dead , and we are leaving . Ah ... - Now be a good little Banik and help me power up this Pod . Hmm ? Cable 's fine . Mooring control is totally buggered but we should be able to cut loose if we have to . What 's your problem ? Shouldn 't you be with Crais ? He 's sleeping . Answer the question . Aeryn , I am doing everything I can to get us out of this absurdly large space monster . I 'm doing the good little soldier bit . What else do you want from me ? I want you to stop acting like a drannit . You know what ? I have no idea what a drannit is . No , don 't play dumb with me . That hasn 't worked for over two cycles , John . Aeryn , I am dumb . I don 't understand you half the time and I have no idea what a drannit is ! Fine , forget the drannit . Fine , screw the drannit ! What ? You really have no idea what a drannit is , do you ? What 's a drannit ? Vomit . Come in , please . Vomit ! Stark , you 're still here . Oh , wonderful . They 're alive . Now you can torture them with your inane dribblings . I know how we 're gonna get you out of there . Vomit . Vomit ? - Vomit ? Rygel and I are going to feed the budong . Overfeed the budong . Ice . From the planet 's rings . - Ice ? That 's beautiful , Stark . They can now die laughing . Wait , wait , wait . There 's more . You 're gonna have to dump some of your cesium fuel . Our fuel ? Yes . Dude , cesium and water , and ice is water make exploding water ? Yes , the explosion should make the budong vomit . And you can ride out on the wave of the vomit . In front of the vomit . Stark , give us a moment . They 're going to say yes . No , Sebaceans are ugly , not stupid . They know that cesium fuel and water do not react without an ignition source . They 'll say no . Here it comes . Stark , we 're going to have to say no . See ? - You can light the cesium with-with Talyn 's cannon . Talyn 's cannon is out of commission . But w-w-we have to ha-have a really big explosion . You must have some kind o-o-of something that explodes or something ? No . The main cannon is out , and I 've launched all that ... Oh . They had warheads ? Oh , I disarmed them . You really should tell me these things . How big ? - Big enough . Stark ? We have an ignition source . Crais ! Crais , wake up ! The budong eats . You guys dump the cesium . I set the bomb and free the cable . We all fly out . I 'll talk you through the procedure to arm the warhead and release the cables . Then we 're on the clock ? Yes . You can delay the detonation by 500 microts but if you are outside the ship when it goes off ... I 'm toast . Stark , we 're waiting on you . Yes ! Aah ! Electromagnetic candy ! You flew across its eye ? I had to be sure it would follow . Well , it is , and it 's gaining ! This Pod could never outrun a budong . We just want it to eat 'cause we 're candy ! Candy ? You 'll kill us all , you trankass ! Mother always said I 'd die from incompetence . I finally know what she meant . That 's why we keep people like you chained in the first place . Your entire race ... Shut up ! We 're candy ! Okay , I 'm there . Man , you guys should see this ugly , sticky flesh . Kind of like my Aunt Ruth 's special Jell-O . Can you access the panel ? Ah , yeah . Give me a second . Yeah , got it . Right . Don 't press the green button yet . That arms the warhead . The blue key is the cable release . Crichton , you ready for the sequence ? Don 't frell this up . Areyn , give me some slack . I 'm on maneuvering jets . Crais , can you start waking Talyn up ? Talyn is already awake . What ? John ? Hey , Stark , you 're ready yet ? I 'm stuck out here in spam land . Yes . Oh , no ! Yes . Sort of ... Oh , no , no ... Come on . No , no , wait ! Why isn 't he communicating ? John , I need you to put a hold what you 're doing . I need you to wait . His comm 's on . - Ah , give me a break . Oh , yes , now . Do it now ! Do it now ! Man , gotta love that boy 's confidence . Warhead armed . 500 microts and counting . We 're moving . Talyn ? - John , answer me . Releasing cable ... now . The cable , Areyn ! Aeryn ... Areyn , we can 't outrun the budong much longer . You should have dumped enough fuel . Not now , Stark ! Talyn , Crichton is outside the ship . He already knows . He 's been awake for some time . And moving into position for the fuel dump . He 's doing what ? He 's leaving Crichton behind . He ... he can 't ! He correctly fears being too close to the point of detonation . Talyn just spaced John ! Aeryn , can you read me ? Can you read me ? Okay . I 'm at the hatch . Coming in . Open the door ! I never thought ... I tried to warn ... Talyn never trusted Crichton . What are you talking about ? Crichton is not a Peacekeeper . He 's not a Sebacean . So ? - So he finds him offensive . Perceives him as a threat . To whom ? ! You . He wants to protect you . John is only dangerous to himself . I tried to persuade Talyn that he was wrong about Crichton . Well then persuade him now to go back and get him . He cannot be coerced . He will do as he wants . I can do nothing . Don 't you lie to me , Crais . This is not about what Talyn wants . You have taught him everything he knows . This is about you , me and John . Hey , Talyn , I 've been reviewing this situation . Aeryn 's pretty pissed at me , but she kinda likes me . Talyn , prepare to dump 70 % of our cesium . No , Talyn ... - Aeryn . Crais , well he hates me , but he 's not stupid . He knows if he kills me , that Aeryn would do the math and his shot at domestic bliss would be cut off , along with his balls . I regret losing Commander Crichton . He was an honorable man . But we need you here , now . That leaves one suspect . Open the door , you soulless , tin-headed , adolescent pig ! Crichton is gone . You 've seen it . Talyn , show me . The truth . Peacekeeper lies . I 'm ... So you should be . - Aeryn ! Aeryn ! You have to do it now ! You have to dump the fuel now ! Yes , Stark . 200 microts are left , I concur . Talyn , initiate the fuel dump now . Open the frelling door ! Open it ! Talyn , I recommend you do as Officer Sun requests . Detonation in 80 microts . Talyn ... I want you to share something with me . Before he dies . You can taste something that is denied to Peacekeepers . Something that you will never know . Areyn ... Can you feel that ? Good . Talyn ... that is what it is to need someone . You don 't need me . You never will . Aeryn ? No ! Ten microts . Five , four ... three , two ... one ! Detonation ! Yes , yes , yes , yes ! Yes . - I knew it would work . Talyn ? Docking Web . On the Pod . And set a course away from here . I wish you would reconsider . My life has been filled with doing what others think is right . For me . For now . This is right . Before you go , This contains various surveillance logs . I believe Talyn showed them to Crichton . Have you seen them ? No . Perhaps you should . Some of the entries are very ... creative . I see you found Wynonna . DRD had it . Have you seen ... this ? Yeah . When did you see it ? Aeryn , I 'm not your boyfriend . I 'm not your husband . I 'm not your anything . You can do what you want . It 's not real . You know that , don 't you ? The , uh ... the last part . Talyn altered the image . I never ... recreated with Crais . Not that it should matter . It does . It never did before . You see , I had this life . I liked it . It had rules . I followed the rules . And that made everything right . And then you come along and you frell everything up . S - strange human with ... arrogance , stubbornness ... Dumb . - Let me finish . You saw the recording and you didn 't say a word . You are like a plague , John Crichton , and you have ruined my life . And yet I just ... keep coming back . You could talk now . Lemme show you something . Come here . I 'm not gonna bite . This is a star chart . These are the names I gave the stars . They 've already got names . Yeah , I know but Mintaka Three sounds boring to me , anyway . That 's Huey , Louie , Dewey . You see that one ? There 's that star right there . The bright one . That 's my point of reference . My guide . And it always becomes the center of my chart . I always name it Aeryn . You say it 's your guide ? It 's my one constant . Would you like to name some stars ? There 's a lot of them . Then we could take our time .

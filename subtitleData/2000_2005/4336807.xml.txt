 Futurama [ 3x01 ] - The Honking - CiWaN Notify his survivors . B-E-N-D-E-R Bender ... B-E-N-D-E-R , Bender ... Saying B-E-N-D ! Mail call ! Amy , your designer lingerie catalog . Fry , Sadie 's Bra Parade . And Leela , Bulk Underpants Outlet . You buy once , you 're on the list forever . And for Bender ... A black-bordered envelope . Someone you know must have died . I hope it was one of my enemies . Those guys suck . Oh , no ! My uncle Vladimir ! I 'm sorry . When 's the funeral ? Tomorrow , at the family castle . Followed by the reading of his will . Well , I 'm rich . Goodbye , losers , whom I 've always hated ! Come on ! It 'll be fun . Pardon me , my good simpleton . Could you take us to yon castle ? Some say unholy things happen up there . For example , all of us say that . Superstitious robot mumbo jumbo . Mumbo , perhaps . Jumbo , perhaps not . With your science , are you closer to understanding ... The mystery of how a robot walks or talks ? Yes , you idiot ! The circuit diagram is here on the inside of your case . I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe . I will go this far and no further . And so we commend Vladimir 's remains to the earth . Filings to filings . Rust to rust . To my loyal butler , You There , for decades of service ... I leave a pittance to be paid in 20 installments ... Of 1 / 20th of a pittance each . To my lazy , spoiled son , Tandy , who never learned the value of a dollar ... I leave my entire $ 10 million fortune . Is that a lot ? To my loving nephew , Bender ... If he 's not responsible for my death , I leave my castle . Let 's stay there tonight ! On condition that he spend one night in it . Oh , man ! There 's always a catch . I get a good vibe from this place . Nice long dinner table ... Quiet , well-behaved spiders , graveyard-adjacent . Yep , it 's gonna be ... What is it ? That painting 's eyes are watching me ! Motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors . So does my butt , but I don 't frame it and put it on the wall . Although ... What 's that ? I don 't know , but it 's infectious . No doubt about it . This place is haunted . Don 't be silly , man . The last ghost died 200 years ago . The last human ghost . But robot ghosts ? " 0101100101 . " What does it mean ? It 's just gibberish . " 1010011010 ? ! " Uncle Vladimir ! Come , Bender . You 'll like being dead . They said that about being alive ! Join us . Join us . Join us . Just as I suspected . These robots were buried in improperly shielded coffins . Their programs leaked into the wiring through this old modem ... Allowing them to project themselves as holograms . Of course ! It was so obvious ! That sequence of words I said made perfect sense . We really should tell Bender there 's nothing to be afraid of . Bender , wake up ! He 's okay ! Quick , does anyone have any liquor ? Bender , what happened ? Somebody ran me over ! And not with a normal hover car . It crept along on round rubber feet , like a wolf ! Poor Bender . Seeing things . You 've been drinking too much . Or too little . Anyway , not the right amount . Maybe he has . Look at these tracks . I think Bender may be telling the truth . Bender , you look awful . I prescribe makeup . Here ! It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case . I just need sleep . I had nightmares about cars running people over . Many dream of a fresh new look . And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true . Look ! They found those same rubbery tracks in New New York . A hit-and-run by the robot porno theater . Robot porno theater ? I was in that general area last night . Whoever ran me down out on the moors followed me back here ! No one 's trying to run you over . Stop being a big hallucinating baby . Yeah ? Could a big hallucinating baby do this ? I 'm scared ! I don 't know which I like more , smashing cars or faces . Lucky you won 't decide tonight . Come on . It 's church tomorrow . Did you hear something ? It was probably just a golden marmoset . Don 't sound like no golden marmoset I ever heard . Made it . So , what are you wearing tomorrow ? Where ... ? What the ... ? Transmission fluid ? Where have I been ? What happened ? Gets out of here , youse lousy bum ! Please , I 'm scared . We all are . It 's the human condition . That 's why I put on this tough guy facade . Now beat it ! I passed out around midnight , much earlier than usual . When I woke up , I found these in my chest cabinet . Relax . You were probably just shooting big fuzzy craps . No ! I think I may have hurt someone . Lord , I 'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown . You 're scaring me . You 're going wacko ! Right . I need professional help . And damn the expense ! Damn the expense ! You have nothing to worry about . Except a nightmarish life of unremitting horror ! For you see , you are a were-car . A were-car ? The car that ran you down was a were-car . It beamed the virus to you through its demonic headlights ! That 's crazy . Yes . So crazy that it must be true ! Each midnight , when your clock resets to 0 ... Your hardware reconfigures into a murderous car . I can 't keep running people over . I 'm not famous enough to get away with it . Help me ! Yes . But you must be willing to pay a terrible price . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Follow me . According to this ancient " read me " file ... Your only hope is to destroy the first were-car . I 'm with you . In its death throes , the car will beam out the virus ' uninstall program ... Ridding you of the curse . Otherwise , I can never die ? Sure you can die ! You want to die ? No ! There 's still too many things I don 't own ! Then live on . Forever cursed ! Each night , your attacks will become more gruesome ... Until one dark night you are doomed to kill your dearest friend . I wouldn 't want to be me . Now go . Go ! Could one of you just ... ? Ah , forget it . I 'll just sleep here . There . No rampaging for you tonight . What about welding everyone except me to the wall ? Just relax . Tomorrow we 'll pry you down , have breakfast ... And go hunt down that ancient evil . It 'll be a rich , full day . I 'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them . Bender , no ! Fry , stay back ! You jerk ! I thought I was your best friend ! What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you ? He 's supposed to murder his closest friend , which was me . But he went for you , not even trying to second-degree-murder me . Could you help me ? Bender crushed my foot . Stop rubbing it in ! Oh , God ! Fry , I 'm so glad to see you . Did I hurt you ? Not physically . Why not ask your new best friend Leela ? I tried to run you over ? It was very sweet of you . It doesn 't mean anything . I have love enough for two . Words . Nothing but sweet words turning into bitter orange wax in my ears . Enough with the feelings . To cure Bender , we 've got to hunt down the original were-car . Cursed . Got it . Whatever . The tracks lead here . Thanks , eagle eye . It 's daylight . He should be in robot form . But be careful . Many robots are stupid and violent . I wish I was stupid and violent . We 'd see what 's what . I 'd pound him till ... Get ye to your houses , ye ignorant villagers ! We aren 't ignorant villagers . We 're sophisticated New New Yorkers . Whoop his butt ! Stop ! What are ye doing ? Whaling on the original were-car , which is you , jerk ! Ye think me be he ? SÃ­ . Nee . I mean no . I was given the curse many a year ago ... While on a bird watching trip to The Arctic . I was attacked by a vicious motorized sled . The natives called it the abominable snowmobile . It 's true . I ran over that bird-watching jerk and 100 others . Even my best friend from aromatherapy school . I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me . Alas , I 'm not the original were-car . I got the curse while taking a class from a famous robot actor . You know him as ... Calculon . O fate most cruel , would that my acting skills ... Might avail me a sword to slay this wretched curse . Let 's kick him ! Let me explain . It all began one fateful night 1000 years ago . Whoa , whoa ! You 're 1000 years old ? Your bio says you 're 27 . Lies ! I change my identity and appearance ... Every decade to avoid suspicion . I was all of history 's great acting robots . Acting Unit 0.8 , Thespo-Mat , David Duchovny . Are you the first were-car or not ? No . But you 're near the end of your search . I was attacked by the original were-car . Give us a name , MacButt ! The year was 2019 , and I was just a lowly roboton working ... In an automotive research lab . I was working on Project Satan ... A savage car built from the evil parts of the world 's most evil cars . The steering Wheel from Hitler 's car , the signal from Charles Manson 's VW . Knight Rider 's Windshield Wipers . Knight Rider wasn 't evil . His windshield wipers were . It didn 't come up in the show . Only after finishing Project Satan ... Did they discover they had made a horrible mistake . For you see , it was pure evil . So , what happened to Project Satan ? It 's either in Paris or much more likely ... Still in the abandoned automotive lab . You guys distract the were-car ... And I 'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato . There it is . It looks so unhappy . Excuse me , are you Project Satan ? Don 't be afraid . We know what you are . You do ? Would you like us to put you out of your misery ? Misery ? What misery ? I love killing people ! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard ! Look , everyone loves killing people , but I don 't wanna hurt my friends . Oh , no ! It 's midnight ! Hey , this is starting to feel pretty good . Fry , distract him ! Hey , Project Satan ! Over here ! I 'm a blind pedestrian . 20 points ! Oh , no ! There 's no exhaust pipe ! That 's right , thanks to Ed Begley Jr . ' s electric motor ... The most evil propulsion system ever conceived ! Take whichever one you want . Oh , boy ! I feel like a car in a candy store ! Yes ! He chose me ! He 's trying to kill me ! Leela , I 'm so happy ! Oh , thanks , Bender . Too tight ! Too tight ! Bender , you 're cured ! But what happened to Fry ? I must have killed him ! He 's my best friend and I killed him ! I never felt so empty inside . Bender , I 'm alive ! You didn 't hurt me at all ! But I know you wanted to . And that 's what matters . Here 's to you . That 's my last beer , you bastard ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you too , buddy . I 'll kill you too .

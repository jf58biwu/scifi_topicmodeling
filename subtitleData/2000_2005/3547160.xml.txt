 911 . What 's your emergency ? Uh , please help . He 's bleeding . Okay , sir , who 's bleeding ? Oh , my God , no . Uh , he 's shooting them , he 's shooting them all ! Who is , sir ? Oh , my God , he just , uh ... I think before that was his son . Please , please hurry - he 's going after his daughter now . Sir , I need a little more information . What more do you need ? They 're dying . Stop him . Sir , where are they ? 113 Coral Way . Patrol units will be dispatched immediately . Go , go , go ! SWAT ! SWAT ! Drop your weapon ! I 'm not scared of you ! Freeze ! Drop your weapon ! No ! No ! Sergeant , I 'm confused . We had a credible threat , Lieutenant . Victim came at me with that knife . I don 't see any blood on that knife . He didn 't get close enough to stab me . So nobody actually got stabbed . Where is the family , Sergeant ? Wife 's outside with my men . What about the kids ? Cleared the premises . No " next of " in the house . 911 dispatch call said that there were children in peril . Sergeant , it would appear that you acted on unsubstantiated information . And we are very sorry about the casualties sir . But tactically , Lieutenant , we were in the right . Wait outside . No kids , no gun . He must have grabbed a knife for self-defense . What the hell has happened here ? Frank , it 's called crime scene investigation . I can 't believe this is happening . Why would they shoot him ? Mrs. Maddox , your husband was brandishing a knife . To protect me . To protect you from who , ma 'am ? Who do you think ? From your men . We were just talking about his business meeting later today , and they just burst in . I am gonna sue your department for all that it 's worth . Mrs. Maddox ... My husband was a good man , Lieutenant , and you took him from me . 911 . What 's your emergency ? Uh , please help . He 's bleeding . Okay , sir , who 's bleeding ? Uh , the boy ... the boy is . Sir , please , I 'm going to need some more information . where is he bleeding ? I , uh , I can 't tell . Oh , God , he just , uh , he just picked it up again . Sir , please , I need you to calm down and help me . Is that the 911 call ? Yeah , I got access to the E911 system , and luckily for us , they , uh , record every call as soon as it comes in . Uh , I can see him . Oh , my God , he just , uh ... I think before that was his son . Please , please hurry - he 's going after his daughter now . Sir , I need a little more information . What more do you need ? They 're dying . Stop him . Sir , please . I need a little more ... Can you tell where the call originated ? Yeah . Automatic Location Identification system takes every number and , uh , matches it to an address . So if the number 's in the database , we 're gonna find a house . Sir , where are they ? 113 Coral Way . Patrol units will be dispatched immediately . Neil Jackson . 109 Coral Way . That 's next-door to the Maddox house . Do you know what " swatting " is , Mr. Jackson ? Killing flies ? Try people . It 's when someone places fake phone call to 911 , causing SWAT to respond to a non-situation , and results in the injury of innocent people . And why would I know what that is ? Because a SWAT call was made from your home and it caused the death of Michael Maddox , your next-door neighbor . I wasn 't even home this morning . The call center confirms that the call came from your house , Neil . That 's insane . Exclusive of the fact that I 've got no reason to want Michael dead . Well , there is that little matter of his lawsuit against you . Look ... I just wanted to put an addition onto my house , crease the market value , but Michael was dead set against it . He isn 't anymore . I did not make that call . Then why don 't you tell me who did ? There was this guy , yesterday . I caught him hiding in my tree . What the hell are you doing ? So you really expect me to believe that this same guy broke into your house and made the call ? All I know is that I didn 't . Then I 'm sure you won 't mind waiting in holding until I believe you . So , Calleigh ran Neil Jackson 's voice against the 911 recording , and there was no match . You know , there might be something to this whole tree climber story . The only prints we found on his phone were his own . Okay , well , then this tree might just break the tie . You got something ? Yeah . Got some skin . Hey . Got anything ? Yeah . The epithelials we got in Neil Jackson 's tree gave me the DNA profile on this guy . Kurt Rossi . Yeah , how do I know that name ? He calls himself a private investigator . Got a long list of clients , all with deep pockets . What 's the big attraction ? Big attraction , he 'll put his morals aside , so you don 't have to , bends the law to get people what they want . Based on his record , he looks like he breaks the law quite a bit , too . He 's got burglary , obstruction of justice , false impersonation , bribery of a witness . Look , he doesn 't do the time , either . 18 months probation ? Who is this guy ? He 's our number one suspect . No means no , okay ? No doesn 't mean maybe , and no doesn 't mean " ask me again . " Okay ? Get off the phone , please . I got to go . Lieutenant Caine . I understand you were on Neil Jackson 's property yesterday . I 'm a private investigator - I go a lot of places . What 's so special about ... that place ? A phone call originated from that property which got Michael Maddox killed . Why would I kill Michael ? He 's a nice guy . Good client , pays on time . You worked for him . Michael had doubts about his wife . He wanted me to find out if she was cheating on him . So I settled into those branches hoping Lucy and her mystery man would show up . Until Johnny Neighbor comes home , and ... Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? Never got any of the dirt . No names , nothing ? Michael hired me to do things his way , and that takes time . If it were up to me , I 'd look Lucy Maddox in the eye and ask her point-blank . Maybe I can help you with that . Hoping to talk me out of my lawsuit ? Mrs. Maddox , were you having an affair ? What on earth would make you ask me such a thing at a time like this ? I am merely trying to establish motive . Well , I 'm not . As it turns out , your husband hired a private investigator , a one Kurt Rossi , to spy on you . Of course . Michael saw conspiracies everywhere - at home , at work , in the news . I 'm not surprised he hired that vermin . Who else was he concerned about ? His business partner , Peter Cullen . They started a hedge fund . Michael wanted out , and Peter 's fighting him . It only fueled his paranoia . My husband is dead , and you 're coming to me with this . I am . Yeah , well , have it your way , Lieutenant . Your SWAT team destroyed everything - even Michael 's car , which I am adding to the list of things that they ruined . His car ? Smashed the front bumper in . I can 't see any possible reason for that . All right , I 'm on it . Thanks . Wife tried to stonewall , throw suspicion on the business partner . Horatio called to tell you that ? Called to say the wife says SWAT damaged the car . But it 's not their MO . Well , I can tell you SWAT didn 't do that . Silver paint , verity of damage , that 's vehicular impact . It 's an accident Lucy Maddox didn 't know about . Paint 's still flaked and hanging on . Means it 's recent . Could be relevant to the case . This car has an event data recorder . Means we 're gonna be able to tell who our victim had an accident with . So what exactly does this thing do ? Documents accidents . It senses deceleration over 1 G-force and it automatically records for 15 seconds . So if Maddox were in an accident today , the footage will be here ? Yeah , and hopefully someone with motive . Well , you know what that means . It 's possible the SWAT call was meant to finish off Maddox after the accident . Got a plate . See that ? I 'm gonna put out a BOLO . Want to step out of the car , please ? Did you , uh , have a little accident , Mr. Decker ? Minor fender bender . That turned into something major . I 'm sorry . Why was I pull over ? " To Lucy . " You wouldn 't happen to know Michael Maddox , would you ? No . Why ? Because Lucy is his wife 's name . Isn 't that right , Frank ? Yeah . Do you want to come clean , Romeo , or should I read the card ? Lucy and I have been seeing each other . Her husband 's this paranoid freak . Paranoid freak ? You 're having n affair with his wife . We call that " motive . " You 're gonna come with us . I didn 't kill him . The accident was a freak coincidence . We didn 't even stop to check for damage . Problem is Michael Maddox had his car equipped with a video monitoring system . Caught you two having words . So would you like to change your story now , Charlie ? Okay , we got out of our cars , but it 's an accident , tempers rise . Tempers rise and let the killing begin , huh ? Hey , he 's the one who came after me out of nowhere . What is wrong with you ? Didn 't you see me coming ? He was crazed . You know what he said ? He said if I didn 't stop seeing Lucy , he was gonna kill me . But you didn 't want to end things , so you beat him to the punch . I didn 't kill Michael Maddox . I wasn 't even at their house this morning . You didn 't need to be . All you needed was your voice . I thought you said all you had was video . Well , that 's of the accident . So what 's the recording of ? The murder . You 're still working on the swatter 's 911 call ? Yeah , but I haven 't hit on any of the suspects yet . What about Kurt Rossi ? No , not even our number one candidate for breaking into Neil Jackson 's house . I did isolate a sound in the background hoping it would help us to identify the 911 caller . And this is the noise I got . It 's a low Doppler rumble . Sounds like a cannonball rolling by . I just can 't figure it out . There 's no match to the voice or environment . What if the killer manipulated it ? Will you play the call again ? It 's an airplane . The caller must have lowered the pitch to mask their voice . Let me just recalibrate the vocal track here for one second . 911 . What 's your emergency ? Please help . He 's bleeding ! Okay , sir , who 's bleeding ? The boy . The boy is . I think I got it now . Uh , please help . He 's bleeding . Okay , sir . Who 's bleeding ? Uh , the boy . The boy is . Sir , I 'm going to need some more information . Where is he bleeding ? Uh , I can 't tell . I need you to calm down and help me . Oh , my God , now he , he 's shooting them ! He 's shooting them all ! I don 't believe it . Our 911 caller 's a woman . It could have been Michael 's wife , Lucy Maddox . No , she was inside the house.It 's impossible . Not unless you tamper with a dedicated phone line . That way you can make it appear a call came from any phone number . So you 're saying that it 's possible that the call didn 't come from Neil Jackson 's house . Well , Lucy Maddox already lied about the affair . I think it 's time to bring her in . Let 's just hold on that for a sec . 'Cause if that call came from anywhere , give me a chance to figure out just where anywhere is . Hey , you 're not authorized to be in there . This warrant says I am . But I tell you what 's not authorized is for you to tamper with phone lines . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'll explain to you . See this over here ? This is Neil Jackson 's house . This is his phone line . Everything looks normal . Except you follow these two wires down . You keep following them down , following them down ... And lo and behold , there is a lineman set attached to his phone line . Don 't know what it 's doing in there . I 'll explain that to you , too . This lineman set piggybacks on Neil Jackson 's phone line . So when you make a call from it , it shows up on someone 's caller I.D. as Neil 's phone . Why 'd you do this ? I did it for a little side money . A little side money . Who paid you ? Paid for my silence , too . I don 't think you understand the seriousness of this situation . Because of your little innovation here , somebody was murdered today . Hey , my boss finds out , I 'm gonna lose my job . You already lost your job , but if you want to save your ass , you 're gonna trace the number to whoever 's piggybacking off of Neil . You 've reached Debby Schiffer , assistant to Peter Cullen . Leave a message and I 'll get right back to you . Hey , Horatio , you might want to visit Michael Maddox 's partner ... because the 911 phone call came from his office . Security says that 's Debbie 's desk . We may be too late . Debbie 's not here . Ms. Boa Vista , take a look at this . A voice transformer . Well , that pretty much sinks her , doesn 't it ? Yes . You speak into the headset , adjust the pitch of your voice and you become someone else . My God ! Now he , he 's stabbing them ! He 's stabbing them all ! Got our murder weapon . If you 're with the media , I 'm gonna have to ask you to leave . We 're not with the media , Mr. Cullen . We 're with Miami-Dade PD . We 've been getting a lot of calls about Michael 's death . Mr. Cullen , are you aware that your assistant placed the call that got him killed ? Debbie 's the one who called SWAT ? I 'm amazed . Debbie hated the fact that Michael was selling off the company . She was scared she would get downsized , lose her townhouse . Debbie 's Type A , but this is extreme . Where is she now ? She ran down to her car to get something . I 'm surprised she isn 't back yet . Are you ? Stay here . It 's Debby Schiffer . Still warm . Bullet 's still inside . Let 's get it to Ballistics . Natalia , no more collateral damage . Done . This is a private office ! Sorry , pal , I got a warrant . What exactly are you looking for ? Gunshot residue . So you think I shot my assistant ? We did our homework . Miami Herald 's devoted a lot of ink to you and Michael recently . " Acrimonious " is the word they 're using . It all fits , Mr. Cullen . You get Debbie to make your fake 911 call , your partner dies as does the threat to dissolving your company , and you silence your accomplice . Hands out , please . He wanted to sell , I didn 't . How that adds up to murder is beyond me . Paper said you 'd been hemorrhaging clients and cash to the tune of about a hundred thou a day by your own quotes . Now if that 's not motive , I don 't know what is . I see . So , Miss Duquesne , find anything ? No , I didn 't . I 'mgoing to need your jacket . Here . I have better things to do . I don 't think so , Mr. Cullen . You washed the GSR off your hands . Take him downtown . You here for the Maddox case , Kurt ? Lieutenant . Oh , no , no . Um ... About a young lady named ... Schiffer . Yeah . I guess we can safely assume you 'll work for anybody as long as the price is right . Not for you . You 've got nothing on Peter Cullen . You mean , except for the gun . Off a search warrant obtained by Calleigh Duquesne . My firearms expert . Which is the only reason the warrant was issued . Not true , Kurt . But I can make people believe that it is.Okay ? So lose your warrant . Lose your case . Drop this . Peter Cullen is not your guy . I don 't agree with that , either , Kurt . We don 't agree about much , do we ? No . Then game on . One thing you 'll learn about me , I got eyes , ears everywhere . Join the club . Mr. Caine . I 'd love to chat , Rick , but this is important . Can it wait ? No , it can 't . Your evidence is tainted , and I have to pull you off this case . What ? Remember the Website " Solve a Crime With Calleigh " ? Damage is still being done . There 's a a video of you on it , reading off a piece of paper . Those are my notes . What of it ? " Crime Scene recognition . Documentation . Collection . " It was basically a checklist of how to process a crime scene , as if you didn 't know how . Yeah . That was the Website that almost got me killed . I remember it . Well , it could be made to appear as though you tampered with evidence or cleaned up a crime scene for two criminals . To save my own life . This is Rossi 's doing , isn 't it ? Trust me . I know you 're a hero . The department knows you 're a hero . Okay , so what are you saying ? He can get inside people 's minds and change them ? We have to play by the rules . He doesn 't . He took it to the State Attorney . Okay , so you 're telling me that I am probably sitting on the murder weapon , and yet I can 't do anything about it ? Way I see it is there 's only one option . No . There is always more than one option . Get him to change his mind back . I don 't care . I 'll do whatever it takes . I am sorry . Okay , so you 're telling me that I 've been on the force for ten years , and yet I still have to prove myself ? System isn 't perfect . And yet it still demands perfection . Calleigh , I just heard . Why didn 't you tell Stetler the truth ? That the notes were mine . Okay , about the sheet , here 's the thing . You know , after you were shot , you came back to work pretty fast . And maybe it was too fast . And I guess I was just so happy that you were okay that I didn 't say anything . And I probably should have . Say anything about what ? Well , are you okay ? We never talk about it . You never talk about it . It 's a process . And the medication helps . And therapy helps . And I make a few little notes here and there and that helps . Well , I have to say something . Because I feel for you , and you know that . But if one memory lapse allowed a killer to go free ... I would 've turned in my badge a long time ago . You know that . I 'm re-training my brain , Calleigh . But I know how to do my job . What about the cheat sheet ? Why does everyone keep calling it that ? Work isn 't a test that you take . It 's something you do right . Every time . So what if I take a few notes ? Would it make you feel better to know that I 've never consulted them , not once ? Look , you know what ? I 'm going to got to Stetler myself . I 'm going to tell him everything . Don 't . Here 's the thing , I 'm off the case , but you 're not . Find another way to get the guy . I know you can do that . Do that instead . For us . All right . This private investigator 's got everybody scrambling , huh ? What are you doing here ? Checking Peter Cullen 's jacket for GSR . I thought Calleigh already tested it . And she didn 't find any . Not necessarily . So then why wouldn 't the sodium rhodizonate pick up on it ? Because there 's GSR , and there 's GSM . GSM ? Gunshot mist . I 'm using a new method that detects microscopic metal particles on dark surfaces . With liquid nitrogen ? Yeah . Well , combine it with hydrochloric acid , lead and antimony become photoluminescent . You can detect the tiniest remnants of a gun being fired . You 're really putting in quite the effort on this one . It 's my fault that we can 't use the evidence Calleigh gathered . You got him . Yeah . What 's your private investigator doing here , Mr. Cullen ? He is representing me . Dusted off my old degrees . You 're a lawyer , too ? I 'm whatever my clients need me to be . Well , today I hope you 're a miracle . Because that 's what your client needs . We found GSM on your jacket . Never happened . We have evidence that says different . Sometimes it 's not about the evidence , it 's about who collected it . You 're right . It wasn 't CSI Duquesne this time . It was me . Exactly . Here . Eric , how have you been coping at work ? Every day is different . I Thought I 'd be back in , uh , my daily rituals by now . I thought I 'd be a hundred percent , but it 's taking a long time . It 's only been a month since the shooting . And that frustrates you ? Of course . I have to be really methodical about everything . Even dumb stuff . Writing checks , I can 't I can 't remember what year it is sometimes . And do you feel like your coworkers are distancing themselves ? No . Not at all . In fact , there 's this one woman that I work with . Uh , her name 's Calleigh . Huh . How did you get that ? People send me things . I hang on to them . You never know when it might come in handy . That 's from a confidential session , and unfortunately your recording has nothing to do with our case . Except that it ... ruins Eric Delko 's credibility as an investigator . I processed every piece of evidence in this case by the book . Who 's gonna believe that when you don 't even know what decade we 're in ? That 's not what I said . Well , that 's what it sounds like . Now , while you guys pursue this case , this recording and a dozen more like it will be on YouTube . So ... do you want to arrest my guy ? Or not ? Get out of here . Let 's go . Still have time to get our table at the Fenston . You heard what happened . I did . First Calleigh . Now me . Rossi 's behind all this . And he 's going to get away with murder . No , he 's not , Eric . But we don 't know what else he has on us . It doesn 't matter what he has on us . Why not ? Because we 're going to destroing him first . Eric told me I 'd find you down here . You know , it is killing him that he can 't work on this case . Well , let 's close the case then . What we need is to go back to the beginning . Back to the SWAT team . 'Cause everything else is right up Rossi 's alley . The piggybacking of the phone lines , the voice modulation , the surveillance . But how do we connect this to him ? The inciting incident . He had to make sure that Michael Maddox would rush the SWAT team . So therefore the confrontation was created . Where does that leave us ? That leaves us right here . This paint transfer 's too high on the car . The custom bumper on the Escalade makes ground clearance on both cars the same height . So if the cars hit normally , then the paint transfer should be only on the bumper . Unless Mr. Decker jammed on his brakes . Lowering the front of his car . Causing the accident . So Charlie Decker targeted Michael Maddox . So you lied to me , Charlie . About what ? You told me that Michael Maddox came at you . Yeah . You saw the video . I did . And I believe that you hit him with intention . Now why would I do that ? Kurt Rossi , Charlie . Kurt Rossi ? The big P.I. ? I 've heard of him . Charlie Decker . Do I know you ? You can call me Rossi . I know you 're sleeping with Lucy Maddox . And I know that her husband just found out . Oh , God , are you here to ... ? Look , I 'm on your side . Charlie ... you can continue protecting Mr. Rossi , or start taking care of yourself . Okay . Okay . Somehow , Kurt knew about me and Lucy . That I was completely crazy about her . Now you love her , right ? Yeah . Then here 's what you 're going to do . So he told me to stage an accident and then he 'd take care of the rest . What is wrong with you ? Didn 't you see me coming ? Sure I did ... Michael . I 'm Charlie Decker . You know who I am . Look ... you stay away from my wife , all right ? What are you going to do about it , huh ? I 'll tell you what , I 'll give you some time to think , but when I come into your house to take Lucy , I hope you are man enough to fight back . That 's him ! Don 't do this ! No ! I am not scared of you . Michael , this will kill me ! Don 't do this ! What am I supposed to do now ? Give me the rest of it . I can 't do that . Okay , Charlie . Then I guess I just have to accept his offer . Whato you mean ? Mr. Rossi claims that you planned the whole thing . He said that ? Mm-hmm . So ... what do you want to do ? I 'll have your best bourbon , neat . Put it on their bill . You double-crossed me . What are you talking about ? I teed up Michael Maddox for you and you sell me out ? Who is this guy , Kurt ? He 's nobody . Get out of here , Decker , before you get hurt . Yeah ? Like you hurt Michael ? Our business is concluded . You 're calling what we did business ? Yeah . What the hell is he talking about ? Yeah , Kurt , why don 't you tell him ? You want to know ... what I did ? Peter ... I saved your ass . Do you think I 'm stupid ? 'Cause I smell these across a room . Who are you to try to take me down ? Okay , listen , guys ... I 'm sorry , okay ? I didn 't have another option , ll right ? They had me dead to rights . Yeah ? My secretary was worried about that same thing . You know what happened to her ? No . I put one in her chest . Guys look , listen to me , okay ? I will clam up . I will do the time . I will disappear . You believe this guy ? This dead ttle man ? I got SWAT to kill Michael Maddox . You don 't think I can get to you in prison , huh ? That 'll be all , Mr. Decker . You taught him well , Kurt . Hey , nice try , Caine . Really , um ... you got nothing . I already found your wire . Not all the wires , Kurt . And thank you , Kurt , for having a big mouth . You guaranteed this could never be traced back to me ! If I testify on his involvement with Maddox , maybe we can make a deal ? Like rats off a sinking ship , huh , Kurt ? My offer still stands . Mm . Come on . Do you want your lab 's dirty secrets hung out to dry ? Kurt , your offer is meaningless now , just like you . Ca-Caine ? Caine ! So this is Rossi 's private vault . I can 't even imagine what must be on all these . Before , about Stetler ... It 's our secret . We 'll keep it between you and me , okay ? Thanks . Let 's hurry up , this place gives me the creeps .

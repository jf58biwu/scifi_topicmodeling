 [ Ominous instrumental music ] AEREON : They are an army unlike any other ... crusading across the stars toward a place called UnderVerse ... their promised land . A constellation of dark new worlds . Necromongers they 're called . And if they cannot convert you , they will kill you . Leading them , the Lord Marshal . He alone has made a pilgrimage to the gates of the UnderVerse ... and returned a different being . Stronger . Stranger . Half alive and half ... something else . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] AEREON : if we are to survive , a new balance must be found . in normal times , evil would be fought by good . But in times like these ... well , it should be fought by another kind of evil . [ Ominous instrumental music ] [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Panting ] Lining him up for you . TOOMBS : Portside shot coming up . TOOMBS : Steady . Here we go . Steady . Take it ! Take a shot ! Shit . - Toombs , we 're running out of rope ! - Shut up ! I got it ! Again ! Now ! [ Riddick groans ] HENCHMAN : Toombs ! [ Growls ] Riddick . GUNNER 1 : i don 't know , Toombs . Looks kind of tight . Not where l 'm sitting . This is the biggest payday ever . So throw on a fresh pair of panties . Let 's get this right . [ Riddick grunting ] HENCHMAN : Three metres clearance portside . One and a half metres starboard . We got a chokepoint coming up . [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Gunner 2 screaming ] HENCHMAN : What the shit was that ? Tags , you got eyes on Riddick ? Tags ? [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Panting ] Jesus . He just ghosted two guys , and I never even saw him . What do you think ? Maybe we ought to just- - l think you 're my new gunner . Grab a Gat . Stay on top of him this time . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Henchman screaming ] RlDDlCK : You made three mistakes . [ Tense instrumental music ] First , you took the job . Second , you came light . A four-man crew for me ? Fucking insulting . But the worst mistake you made ... . [ Music intensifies ] RlDDlCK : That 's right . Empty gun rack . [ Toombs screams in pain ] - What 's the bounty on my head ? - 1 mil . [ Screams in pain ] 1 .5 . What slam pays 1 .5 for a convict ? Private party . Guy ! Easy ! Anonymous . That 's what the sheet said . What planet ? Helion Prime . Whoa . Where you going ? Last question . And you better get this one right , merc . Whose ship is this ? TOOMBS : Mine ? RlDDlCK : Wrong answer . [ Toombs screaming ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Soft instrumental music ] RlDDlCK : [ Voice-over ] Knew they 'd come for me . Took them five years , but i knew . You don 't expect these mercs to have any honour , any code . But this new bounty from a holy man ... a guy whose neck i saved . Well , lesson learned . No such word as " friend . " Can only end bad when you let someone get too close . Bad for them . So now it 's back to civilisation . All the brightness , and everything i hate . Just wanted to be left alone . WOMAN pilot : [ On radio ] Helion Prime is on alert condition four . All unrecognised craft will be escorted to the ground ... for security inspections . pilot : [ On radio ] Unrecognised craft , follow me ... to Spaceport 6 for security inspections . Do you hear me ? Follow me to Spaceport 6 now ! Follow this . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Slow instrumental music ] RlDDlCK : Did you know all your doors were locked ? Five years ago , i took two people off that planet . RlDDlCK : A kid , Jack , who everyone else thought was a boy ... and a holy man searching for New Mecca . I told one man where l might go . I showed trust to one man . Did I make a mistake , Imam ? There is no simple answer- - Whatever was said was meant to give us a chance . A fighting chance . Were it not for the threat of invasion ... I never would have betrayed you . I give you my word , Riddick . Riddick ! RlDDlCK : And a daughter ... LAJJUN : No . RlDDlCK : ... whose name would be ... . lf you have issue with me , you let it be with me . You need not know their names . Ziza . My name is Ziza . Ziza . Cute kid . ZlZA : Did you really kill monsters ? The ones that were gonna hurt my father ? Such are our bedtime stories . Go , Ziza . Go on . So now who do I have to kill to get this payday off my head ? [ Sombre vocal music ] Imam : It is said the comet always precedes them . Imam : These world-enders . The Coalsack planets are gone . Eight million settlers missing . The entire Aquilan System is gone , too . My God , how do I save my family ? [ Soft instrumental music ] lMAM : Have you heard anything I 've said ? You said it 's all circling the drain . The whole universe . RlDDlCK : Right ? Imam : That 's right . Had to end sometime . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] The one you want is now here . And whose throat is this ? If you cut my throat ... I 'll not be able to rescind the offer that brought you here . Nor tell you why it 's so vital that you did come . The blade comes off when the bounty comes off . This is Aereon . An envoy from the Elemental race . She means you no harm . There are very few of us ... who have met a Necromonger and lived to speak of it . So when I choose to speak of it , you should choose to listen . Necromonger . It is the name that will convert or kill ... every last human life . Unless Furyan warriors are found . They were the one race that would not bow . The only race the Necromongers still fear . Maybe you should pretend like you 're talking to ... someone educated in the penal system . RlDDlCK : In fact , don 't pretend . Imam : There is a story , Riddick , of young male Furyans ... strangled at birth . Strangled with their own cords . When Aereon told this story to the Helion leaders ... I told her of you . What do you know of your early years ? Do you remember your homeworld ? Where it was ? - Have you met any others ? - Others like yourself . Sister , they don 't know what to do with just one of me . AEREON : Spoken like a true Furyan . RlDDlCK : I don 't care where l 'm from , I want the bounty off my head . soldier 1 : Open up in there ! Open up ! soldier 2 : Stand back ! LAJJUN : They are searching houses . They look for a man who came here today . - They think he might be a spy . - A spy . Did someone see him come here today ? Did they ? Lajjun , stop ! I will send them away . But wait one minute , please . Will you wait one minute to save worlds ? Not my fight . So you will leave us to our fate ? Imam : Just like you did her . soldier 1 : Break it down ! [ Pounding on door ] soldier 1 : Get in ! Come , let us try to send them away . [ Tense instrumental music ] LAJJUN : Just let me have her ! soldier 1 : Come on . cleric : Leave us alone . LAJJUN : There is no one here . cleric : You don 't understand . He can help us ! [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] RlDDlCK : You 're not afraid of the dark , are you ? RlDDlCK : The light hurts my eyes . soldier 2 : Where is he ? soldier 3 : He went to this side ! [ Soldiers screaming ] [ Guns firing ] soldier 4 : Where is he ? soldier 5 : In here . [ Knife clatters to the floor ] [ Retreating footsteps ] You mentioned her . She went looking for you . Imam : People died . She went to prison . I am not sure where . It was a world so hot , you couldn 't set foot on the surface . Crematoria . Imam : Young Jack . She thought of you as her older brother . Imam : She worshipped you . RlDDlCK : You were supposed to watch her . Imam : She never forgave you for leaving ... - just when she needed you most . - She needed to stay away from me . You all do . ZlZA : Riddick . Are you gonna stop the new monsters now ? [ Slow instrumental music ] AEREON : Furyans . Defiant to the end . [ Soft instrumental music ] [ Ominous instrumental music ] [ People talking in fright ] No , no . We go to the shelter . We take only ourselves . [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] official : Turn back ! Go to the other shelter . MAN : There is no room . WOMAN : They won 't let us in ! official : Get back . Imam : Stay close . MAN : We must cross the river . [ Fast-paced instrumental music continues ] [ All screaming ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] CONTROLLER : Flight leaders , all squads off the ground now . We have heavy inbound . Follow me in ! [ People screaming ] They 're coming back ! [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] lMAM : The next shelter . This way ! [ People screaming in the distance ] [ Sentimental instrumental music ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Imam : I 'll see if it 's safe . Imam : Stay back . LAJJUN : Come , Ziza . Come ! [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Officer shouting ] [ Rhythmic instrumental music ] soldier : Don 't they have real guns ? Take aim and fire ! [ People grunting ] soldier : Now they 're going down ! Imam : Lajjun and Ziza ! When it 's over . Imam : Let me go. I must go to my family . RlDDlCK : When it 's over . Let 's get your family . [ Gun firing ] In here . Get in . [ Static buzzing ] [ Soldier groans ] [ Static crackling ] LAJJUN : Imam . Imam : Don 't follow me . [ Imam screams ] [ Lajjun panting ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Static crackling ] [ Lajjun whimpering ] [ Lensor groaning in pain ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Imam exclaims in fright ] [ lrgun growling ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] There will be an afterlife for me . Imam : Will there be for you ? [ Imam yells ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Let 's go replenish the ranks . Never fails to inspire , does it ? Each time a dynasty falls . Remember your place , Dame Vaako . My place is at your side , dear husband . From here till UnderVerse come . [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] In this ' verse , humans have been fractured ... divided by all their many races , creeds , and mistaken faiths . Our purpose is to correct that mistake . Because there is another ' verse . Another universe that he has found . Where anyone can begin anew . Where you can live free of pain . A perfect new place called UnderVerse . Look around you . Every Necromonger in this hall ... every one of the Legion Vast ... that just swept aside your defences in one night ... was once like you . Fought as feebly as you . Because every Necromonger that lives today is a convert . minister : There 'll be no conversions ! [ Crowd murmuring ] We all began as something else ! purifier : It was hard for me to accept , too , when I first heard these words . But I changed . I let them take away my pain . cleric : You betrayed your faith . purifier : And I changed . Just as you will change ... when you realise that the UnderVerse will be reached ... only by those who have embraced the Necromonger faith . For those of you who will right now ... drop to your knees and ask to be purified . - We will not renounce our faith ! - No one here will do what you ask . It is unthinkable ! This is a world of many peoples , many religions ! And we simply cannot and will not be converted . MARSHAL : Then I 'll take your soul . [ Crowd gasping ] MARSHAL : Join him ... or join me . [ Sombre instrumental music ] This is your one chance . Take the Lord Marshal 's offer and bow . I bow to no man . He 's not a man . He 's the holy Half-Dead who has seen the UnderVerse ... and returned with powers you can 't imagine . Look , I 'm not with everyone here . But I will take a piece of him . A piece you will have . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Both grunting ] [ Crowd gasping ] MARSHAL : Stop him ! Irgun . One of my best . If you say so . What do you think of this blade ? [ Slow instrumental music ] I think it 's a half-gram heavy on the back end . In our faith , you keep what you kill . Take him back to my ship for mind regression . Perhaps the breeder would do it ... if somebody just asked him . DAME VAAKO : It is a rare offer . A visit inside Necropolis . It 's been a long time since I smelled beautiful . Let me show you the way . [ Slow instrumental music continues ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Beautiful eyes . Come . The last six Lord Marshals have called this home . Magnificent , isn 't it ? - l might have gone a different way . - True of us all . Converts receiving the mark of the Necromonger . They learn how one pain can lessen another . There now . That is just perfect . The more you resist them ... the greater the damage will be . QUASl-DEADS : [ Spectral voice ] A new one . You 've brought us a new one . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Buzzing ] Interesting breeder . QUASl-DEADS : Making entry . This won 't take long . We 've entered his neocortex . QUASl-DEADS : The Riddick ! MARSHAL : Regress . QUASl-DEADS : Scanning fresh memories . Thoughts of someone called Jack . Riddick ! Jack ! Imam : She went to prison . QUASl-DEADS : Now we find thoughts of an Elemental . The one race that would slow the spread of Necromongers . Imam : Furyans . QUASl-DEADS : Furyans . Where does he come from ? Who are his people ? These are the things I need to know . [ Riddick grunting ] QUASl-DEADS : We find energy . We find Furyan energy . He 's Furyan ! A Furyan survivor ! Kill the Furyan ! Kill the Riddick ! Kill Riddick . [ Tense instrumental music ] Find him . Whatever it takes . Find him . [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] RlDDlCK : Let me guess . A five-man crew this time . TOOMBS : Couple of things you could have done better . First , trash the locater beacon inside my ship , the one you jacked . TOOMBS : And second , and this is really the more important part ... you should have wasted me when you had the chance . - Any questions ? - Yeah . What took you so long ? [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] COMPUTER : Decoy launched . In and out . Unsuspected and undetected . Damn , I love a good smash-and-grab ! MERC 1 : Bounty 's as good as ours . COMPUTER : Preparing to engage ion drive . So where do we drop your merc-killing ass ? TOOMBS : Who 's gonna pay the most for you now ? Butcher Bay ? Butcher Bay . Ten minutes every other day on the dog-run . Protein waffles aren 't bad . How about Ursa Luna ? Nice little double-max prison . They keep a cell open for me , just in case I drop in . TOOMBS : You know the problem with these joints now ? Health clubs for waffle-eating pussies . Maybe we should think about upping our game here a little bit . Think about someplace truly diabolical . What the hell is he thinking now ? RlDDlCK : He 's thinking a triple-max prison . A no-daylight slam . Only three of them left in this system ... two of them out of range ... for a shitty little undercutter like this one with no legs . Leaving just one . Crematoria . That is what you had in mind , right , Toombs ? How does he know where we 're going , and we don 't ? - Dope it out . - l hate this run . Just do it ! Don 't know about this new crew of yours . They seem a bit skittish . Probably shouldn 't tell them what happened to the last crew . You know , you were supposed to be some slick-shit killer . Now look at you . All back-of-the-bus and shit . [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] SCALES : I say we attack Helion Two next . Take it straight into their teeth . SCALES : It 'll cost you 20,000 heads , 5 Warrior Ships ... SCALES : nothing more , I swear it . MARSHAL : While I do prize brute force ... this approach is , perhaps , more artful . MARSHAL : Start at the end . Go straight to Helion Five ... the last planet in the system . MARSHAL : We approach from the night side . Remove these cannon first ... then attack the larger placements at speed . MARSHAL : We 'll catch them on their rear flank . And in 10 days ' time ... the rest of those worlds will tumble before us . MARSHAL : You see , as with most ... their blind spot is right behind them . I 've located an ion trail which leads off-world . Then you should be off-world , Vaako . I 've deployed a tracker team . One of the best . Wherever Riddick has gone ... you lens him out and cleanse him . You . You want me to take a frigate for one breeder ? Don 't question it , Vaako ! Take it on faith . DAME VAAKO : He 's always been unsettled around you . DAME VAAKO : The Lord Marshal . Unsteady . DAME VAAKO : Perhaps because he knows he 's half the warrior you are . Some say he 's too artistic for the job . I wouldn 't be surprised if someone promoted him soon ... to full dead . - Take care what you say . - Should I say it softly ? So it sounds more like conspiracy ? Why is it that when anyone breathes about the demise ... of him on the throne everyone assumes a conspiracy ? DAME VAAKO : Why isn 't that just prudent planning ? When he is ready , he will name a successor . Who ? Toal ? Scales ? The Purifier ? None of them ... with the strength , the dignity ... of Lord Vaako . You can keep what you kill . That is the Necromonger way . RlDDlCK : [ Voice-over ] Mercenaries . Elementals . Necromongers . Shit , i 've never been so popular . i should probably slip these chains and open up a few arteries . But why drive when you can get driven ? Free ticket to Crematoria . Thanks , Toombs . Got me some business there named Jack . And once we settle up , i walk away forever . So i 'll just wait ... all back-of-the-bus for now . MARSHAL : How unexpected ... . An Elemental . Here ? VAAKO : One of the captives . MARSHAL : And why , after 30 years , should it be you ? He doesn 't regard her as a captive , though . Elementals . They talk of neutrality , but they 're all witches and spies . Why else would they come and go like the wind ? MARSHAL : But where has he gone ? Where is the Furyan hiding now ? You be the good warrior . Go after this Riddick . I 'll find out why the Lord Marshal is so threatened by him . [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] COMPUTER : Destination reached . Unlocking manual controls . All right , I make 700 degrees on the day side . 300 below on the night side . pilot : Let 's not get caught in the sun . If I owned this place and hell , I 'd rent this place out ... and live in hell . [ Suspenseful instrumental music continues ] COMPUTER : Slue angle . ; good . CO-PlLOT : Stand by . CO-PlLOT : And ... . COMPUTER : Plotted course ... COMPUTER : good . CO-PlLOT : Hit it ! [ Crashing ] COMPUTER : Angle of approach . ; not good . [ Laughing ] MERC 2 : Look , Ma , no hands ! [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Party poppers ! [ All groaning ] I think I shit myself . Skittish , Toombs . Very skittish . Comfy ? [ Engine humming ] When the ride 's over , your goggles are mine . [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] [ Merc 2 groans in pain ] Four-way split ! [ Toombs laughs maniacally ] 29.4 kilometres . So this is Riddick . What in the bowels of Christ are you talking about ? 700,000 ? Don 't take this one , boss . See , Anatoli here has a nose for trouble . - And this one , this Riddick guy- - - Big , big trouble . So 700,000 is good money . I 'd take the money , Toombs . [ All clanging metal ] BOSS : These are dangerous days , if you believe the talk . TOOMBS : Talk ? BOSS : About dead planets . About some ghost army . About them . Them ? [ All clanging on metal ] I 'll run the numbers again . It takes a couple of days probably . So you can stay as my guest . At least here we are all safe . Yes ? GUARD : Yes , boss . I 'll give it a day . One . [ Man grunting ] [ Tense instrumental music ] GUV : There are inmates , and there are convicts . A convict has a certain code . And he knows to show a certain respect . An inmate , on the other hand ... pulls the pin on his fellow man . GUV : Does the guards ' work for them . Brings shame ... [ Man groans ] to the game . So which are you gonna be ? Me ? [ Slow instrumental music ] I 'm just passing through . Welcome to Crematoria . - How do I get eyes like that ? - You got to kill a few people . Did that . Did a lot of that . And then you got to get sent to a slam . KYRA : Where you 're told you won 't see daylight again ? There wasn 't a doctor who could shine my eyes ... not even for 20 menthol Kools . Was anything you said true ? [ Kyra panting ] What are you gonna do ? Go for the sweet spot ? Remember who you 're talking to , Jack . Jack 's dead . She was weak . [ Tense instrumental music ] She couldn 't cut it . The name 's Kyra now . And I 'm a new animal . [ Slow instrumental music ] [ Wind whooshing ] DAME VAAKO : I 'm so glad I could steal you away for a moment . Doesn 't it strike you odd ? DAME VAAKO : Here we have the current Lord Marshal ... destroying entire societies ... and yet he can 't bring himself to kill one stranded Elemental . Why is that ? You don 't pray to our God . You pray to no God , I hear . Elementals , we calculate . Don 't we all . But now let 's have first things first . What of Riddick ? In truth , I don 't know where he went . In truth , I 'm more interested in where he came from . Watch your step . I 've always wondered , does an air Elemental fly ? Now do me a favour . Calculate the odds of you getting off this planet alive ... and now cut them in half . No , we can 't fly . But we glide very well . Save your threats , Necromonger . I would have told you about Riddick for the asking . It concerns a foretelling ... a prediction now more than 30 years old . A young warrior once consulted a seer of sorts ... and was told that he would die at the hands of a Furyan . So he waged a private war on the planet Furya ... killing all he could find . This was before he became Lord Marshal , of course . That massacre should have ended the matter . But now it seems one Furyan had a knack ... for escape . [ Tense instrumental music ] GUARD : [ On speaker ] Feeding time ! [ Loud buzzing ] convict 1 : Move ! Let 's go ! Come on . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Growls ] Here they come ! [ Tense instrumental music ] convict 2 : Hurry ! [ Beasts growling ] convict 2 : To the cages ! Come on ! A herd ! A goddamn herd ! is that all we are to you ? [ Tense instrumental music continues ] [ Thrash growling ] [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] convict 3 : Let me in ! Wait ! [ Growls ] [ Thrash growling ] [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Thrash purrs mildly ] [ Alarm buzzing ] [ Snarls ] It 's an animal thing . GUARD 1 : Check her for me . She 's always got a blade somewhere . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Kyra grunts ] [ Guard 2 groaning in pain ] [ Guards groaning ] [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Growls angrily ] RlDDlCK : I don 't think she likes being touched . I 'd take my wounded and go while you still can . is there a name for this private little world of yours ? What happens there when we don 't just run away ? You 'll kill us with a soup cup ? Tea , actually . What 's that ? I 'll kill you with my tea cup . GUARD 1 : You know the rule . They aren 't dead if they 're still on the books . [ Slow instrumental music ] Come on . Death by tea cup . Damn . Why didn 't I think of that ? I didn 't come here to play " Who 's The Better Killer ? " But it 's my favourite game . Haven 't you heard ? I heard you came looking for me . is that all ? Then you missed the good part . Hooked up with some mercs out of Lupus Five . KYRA : Said they 'd take me on , teach me the trade , give me a good cut . They slaved me out , Riddick . Do you know what that could do to you when you 're that age ? KYRA : When you 're 1 2 years old ? RlDDlCK : I told you to stay in New Mecca . Did you not listen ? I had mercs on my neck . I 'll always have mercs on my neck . I spent five years on a frozen heap just to keep them away from you . And you go and sign up with the same fake badges ... that wanted to cut you up and use you for bait . What are you pitching , Riddick ? That you cutting out was a good thing ? That you had my ass covered from halfway across the universe ? You signed with mercs . [ Sentimental instrumental music ] There was nobody else around . [ Door slams ] Let 's pop the cork . Get some fresh air . [ Machinery humming ] [ Slow instrumental music ] So they do go topside ... to swap out air . Interesting . Who the hell are you ? When it happens , it 'll happen fast . RlDDlCK : Stay on my leg when I cut fence , or die here . Nobody outs this place . Nobody . KYRA : He ain 't nobody . [ Ominous instrumental music ] CO-PlLOT : Seven hundred degrees . Jesus . That 's some sunrise . [ Ominous instrumental music continues ] They can be quite a test . These deep runs . Test of our inner selves . Don 't you find that true ? Some men do . purifier : Just being so far from the armada ... the mind can start to fill with strange thoughts . purifier : Doubts . Don 't you ever have doubts , Vaako ? - Doubts ? - About the campaign . About Lord Marshal . First and always , I am a Necromonger commander . So if you 're here to test my loyalty ... you succeed only in testing my patience . No , that 's not why I 'm here at all . BOSS : Good news first . Talked things over with my amigos here . We 'll cut you in for 775,000 . All right . What 's the bad news ? They close the local whorehouse ? BOSS : No . The bad news is worse than that . Much worse . Our pilot , he saw this . it crossed a shipping lane . Any idea what this might be ? Never saw nothing like it . BOSS : This ship charts back to Helion Prime . BOSS : You know , Anatoli 's got a nose for trouble ... and he thinks trouble follows you here . Look , we dusted our tracks and got the hell out of there . There is no way we didn 't lose them . Them ? [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] This is my prisoner . Mine . Nobody else 's . And I want my money now . You stole a prisoner from them ? [ All grunting ] [ Guns firing ] [ Toombs yells angrily ] [ Guns firing ] [ Tense instrumental music ] TOOMBS : Riddick , no ! Should 've taken the money , Toombs . [ Toombs grunts ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Slow instrumental music ] [ Alarms buzzing ] Mercs . Some guards here , but this can 't be all of them . GUV : Check their slots in the back . And be careful . RlDDlCK : Don 't bother . Guards ain 't there . RlDDlCK : They figured out the Necros are coming for me . Plan was to clean the bank , ghost the mercs ... break wide through the tunnel . Then somebody got a lucky shot off with this rocket launcher here ... and took out the sled . Guards took off on foot ... but rigged the door so no one could follow . RlDDlCK : They 'll take the one ship in the hangar ... and leave everyone else here to die . How come you know all this shit ? You weren 't even here . 'Cause it was my plan . [ Machines humming ] I know that look . I don 't even have to see your face , and I know that look . You want to run the surface while they run the tunnel below . It 's moving in the right direction . We could make it . Stay behind the night ... ahead of the sun . There 's gonna be one speed . Mine . RlDDlCK : If you can 't keep up , don 't step up . You 'll just die . [ Metal clanging loudly ] I should 've taken the money . [ Beasts growling ] Riddick ! [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] Boss ! ANATOLl : Up there . BOSS : Take a look . GUARD : Because Anatoli says so ? Because his nose says so . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Riddick ! Riddick . GUV : Go ! Come on , go ! GUV : Climb here ! GUV : Climb ! Go ! [ Music intensifies ] Riddick . Go . GUARD 1 : They 're heading for the volcano fields . GUARD 2 : Going for our ship ! No chance do they get to the hangar first . No chance ! [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] GUARD 1 : Next one ! Next hole ! We 'll catch them there ! ANATOLl : No more running for you . Where did the big guy go ? [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Guard 2 screams ] [ Guns firing ] Close it ! [ Grunts in anger ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] What was that ? You don 't care if you live or die ? If I kill them first , not really . Maybe I do . Keep moving ! RlDDlCK : Kyra ? - Kyra ! - What ? Get that ass moving ! [ Suspenseful instrumental music continues ] [ Panting ] Riddick ? Remember what I said about not caring if I lived or died ? You knew I was kidding , right ? One speed . Your rope . It 's too late . We 're never gonna make it . Your rope ! Give me your rope ! And your water . All of it ! RlDDlCK : Stay in the shadow of the mountain . Don 't wait for me . Run ! Riddick ! [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Convict groans ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] GUARD 2 : Where the hell is that hangar ? GUV : There it is . Listen . [ Low humming ] Let me guess . Necros . One commander . Five captains . And a whole lot of Necro firepower . Shit ! I hate not being the bad guys . [ Tense instrumental music ] I figure we got three minutes ... before the sun hits us again , burns out this whole valley . Wait . We gonna do this or not ? Just wait . Boss ! [ Men groaning ] [ Low thumping ] Remember that favourite game of yours ? " Who 's The Better Killer ? " Let 's play . KYRA : Come on ! [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Necro groaning ] GUV : On the right ! [ Kyra grunts ] [ Rhythmic instrumental music ] [ Rhythmic instrumental music continues ] Hand . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] KYRA : No ! [ Guv groaning ] [ Slow instrumental music ] [ Vaako groans ] [ Ship buzzing ] [ Sentimental instrumental music ] [ Gasps ] Kyra ? purifier : I was supposed to deliver a message to you ... if Vaako failed to kill you . A message from the Lord Marshal himself . He tells you to stay away from Helion . Stay away from him . And in return , you 'll be hunted no more . But Vaako will most likely report you as dead . So this is your chance . purifier : Your chance to do what no man has ever done . The girl . Where will they take her ? purifier : To the Lord Marshal , of course . I 've done unbelievable things ... in the name of a faith that was never my own . And he 'll do to her what he did to me . purifier : The Necromonger in me warns you not to go back . But the Furyan in me ... hopes you won 't listen . purifier : We all began as something else . [ Slow instrumental music ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] MARSHAL : I have lost a Purifier ... but I have gained a First among commanders . It is overdue , isn 't it ... that we acknowledge your many accomplishments ... your steady faith ... and above all ... your unflinching loyalty ? [ Ominous instrumental music ] Obedience without question . Loyalty till UnderVerse come . Well done , Vaako . This is a day of days . [ Sweeping instrumental music ] MARSHAL : Now , tell me if it 's true . MARSHAL : Tell me the Furyan is gone ... and I can close this campaign without hearing his bootsteps . If he is dead ... I sense I 'm not far from the same fate ... being of no further use here . Shouldn 't I tell you that Riddick is still alive ? Don 't try me , Aereon . I could plough you under with the rest of Helion Prime . No one really knows the future . Then tell me the odds . That Vaako met with success . That I will now be the one who can finish it all . MARSHAL : Conquering or converting all the remaining worlds of man . MARSHAL : Tell me it 's true , Aereon . And maybe I 'll save your home world ... for last . [ Sombre vocal music ] The odds are good ... that Riddick is still alive . Ascension protocol ! We still have numbers out there , Lord Marshal . officer : Sweep teams , recon ships . officer : They would be hard-pressed to make it back- - Get my armada off the ground . [ Ominous instrumental music ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] - You mean on Helion ? - l mean here on this very ship . Could you be wrong ? Mind fabricates fear . Could you be wrong ? Not so wrong as you when you left him alive ! It 's twice a mistake . Not only your failure , but now the report of success . How do we salvage this ? How ? Lord Marshal 's got to be warned . You will never see the UnderVerse ! He will kill us both before our due time . I say give Riddick his chance . If he is half of what you think ... he can at least wound the Lord Marshal . And that is when you must act . Just to take his place ? Just to keep what I kill ? That is the Necromonger way . - lt is not enough ! - Then you do it for the faith ! If he has fear , he has weakness . If he has weakness , Vaako ... . He is unworthy of Lordship . We do it for all Necromongers . Protect the faith . This can still be a day of days . But the timing must ... be flawless . Final protocol . Execute on my order . We 're done with this world . [ Sombre instrumental music ] [ People talking in fright ] Go inside . Ziza , go inside .

MARSHAL : He came for me . [ Tense instrumental music ] MARSHAL : Consider this . MARSHAL : If you fall here now ... you 'll never rise . But if you choose another way ... the Necromonger way ... . Go to him . [ Slow instrumental music ] lt hurts ... at first . But after a while , the pain goes away , just as they promise . Are you with me , Kyra ? There 's a moment when you can almost see the UnderVerse through his eyes . He makes it sound perfect . A place where anyone can start over . Are you with me , Kyra ? [ Slow instrumental music continues ] MARSHAL : Convert now ... or fall forever . You killed everything I know . [ All gasp ] Vaako . Not yet . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] Been a long time since I 've seen my own blood . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Riddick groans ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Music intensifies ] MARSHAL : These are his last moments .

[ Dramatic instrumental music ] Vaako ? Forgive me . Flawless . [ Slow instrumental music ] No . No ! I thought you were dead . Are you with me , Kyra ? I was always with you . KYRA : I was . [ Sentimental instrumental music ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] You keep what you kill . Now , what would be the odds of that ? AEREON : This dark army at the feet of a lone outlaw . And the fate of the rest of the universe ? Not even i dare to calculate that .

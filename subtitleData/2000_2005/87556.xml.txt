 My son ... I had a dream last night , the sun was shining , there were flowers everywhere . Come on , sis , we 'll be late for school ! Zach , look ! Oh no , that machine is going to crush the flower . We have to do something ! Stand back , Cynthia . Zach ! A scambocop ! Halt ! Do not proceed ! You are trespassing in a restricted zone . Hurry , Zach ! Central , machine breakdown in progress . Copy , unit 12 . Do you need any back up ? Negative , Central . Situation under contr ... Another flower saved from Mayor Scamboli 's grasp . Little brats ... They don 't appreciate the magnificence of the city I 've built for them ! It 's the metropolis of the future , the pinnacle of progress ... Yes boss . You said it , boss . ... the temple of technology ... Just look at MY city , Scamboville . Instead of trees and grass , there 's steel and glass ... Concrete , asphalt ! And thanks to ME and my tireless efforts ... Yay , hurray for mayor Scamboli ! ... we have soaring towers , gleaming industries , mega brained robots I could talk to you about Scambo-welfare for retired robots ... about Scambonuses for outstanding robot achievements ... - About ... - You about robo-nursing for depressed executives ... But what 's the use ? Do the children really appreciate my hard work ? - WE do , boss . - Right ! And I won 't let those little termites destroy my creation ... Never ! CABBY . Do you know what bothers me most about children ? - They don 't pay taxes ? - Worse . It 's their ... - whiny little voices I can 't - - - Hi Daddy . Marlene ! Ha ! You know you 're not supposed to barge in here . " Hello , sweetheart . I 'm so happy to see you . Come give Daddy a kiss . " I 've got a hot new program for you , robots . Want to try it out ? - Oh no ... Don 't ! ... No ! - Don 't , Marlene ! - Trust me , it 's wicked . - Please , no ... not again ... Marlene , will you ever grow up ! You 're ruining my robots ! You and your silly robots ... Who needs them anyway ? Kids need to play and have fun , you know . - Scamboville is fun . - Not for us . Nonsense . What ? Haven 't I created special passageways ... just for kids to walk to and from school ? You don 't get it . Scamboville is all about work and technology . - There 's no room for play . - Of course there is . Every building over thirty stories has an authorized de-stressing room . But nowhere for kids to be happy , Daddy . We need our own space . Your own space ... Contain all the children in one single place ? ! Yeah ! What a brilliant idea ! - Alright . I 'll build you one . - You will ? ! Yes . A place just for kids . And I 'll call it Scamboland . - Really ? When will it be ready ? - In no time at all . My fellow citizens . What I have created for the youth of Scamboville is no ordinary entertainment ! It is the latest in technology ! A world of rides and fun , so totally new and unexpected ... S-S-Sca-Sca-Sca-Scambbbb ... boli ... Tonight , I am personally inviting every child in the city to ... attend the grand opening of Scamboland . I promise you all a good time . You children will never get over it ! Ah ! Finally ! Spencer ! Spencer ! Your butler is in the freezer , Mr. Geppetto . Sneaking a cold one . Thanks , house . Spencer , come out of there ! I need your help . - It isn 't bedtime , Spencer ! - Upsey daisey ! T-True , Doc , Doc . B-But as Aunt Pengwend says , 'Early to bed and early to rise , gets you the scummy worm surprise ! ' - D-Did you see who was on TV , huh ? - Hurry , Spencer . It 's time . - Time ? - It 's always time for ... a good cup of coffee . You mean HE 's really , r-really r-ready ? Hurray ! Better late that ends well ! To work ! The clock is ticking ! As-As-As cousin Penguinevere says , Time is golden ... - Spencer ! - ... and silence is money . Power it up . Very slowly . High-High tension mounts . The atmosphere is abuzz with electricity . Current affairs are about to run their course . The energy in the room is super-charged ... Look at all the lights and lasers ! I hope there 's a Ferris wheel . Scamboland ... I 'll believe it when I see it . I can 't believe you really did it Dad ! You socket wrench ! Jump , Rodo . I 'll catch you ! Don 't miss . Silence ! I mean welcome , kids ... junior citizens of Scamboville ! It is my honor as your mayor , fulfilling my duty to you ... as responsible members of our fair city to offer you rides like you have never even dreamed of ! Full power , Spencer ! My daughter Marlene will now have the honor to cut the ribbon . Oh no . Not now , you old rascal . We 're losing it . We 're losing it . We don 't have enough power ! - Did you pay last month 's bill ? - Go on . Go ahead . Cut the ribbon ... Where are the scissors ? Uh , scissors ? The scissors ! I ... I don 't see them . I don 't see them . I 've got it cranked up to the max . - I don 't see them . - Robots ... Ready for the big surprise ? I hope you 're ready for a bigger one , Scamboli . Plug us into the city mains , Spencer ! The city mains , Doc ? ! 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Zero ... Now ! Turn those lights back on ! Told you it would never work . Don 't go ! Everything is under control . We 'll see who gets the last laugh ! Dad ! Ahh ! Pinocchio ! Uncle Spencer ! Oh , Pinocchio ... I 'm overworked , I mean o-overturned ... I-I mean overweight ... no , over ... Hello , Pinocchio Welcome home . What is this ? I 'll explain it to you someday . Now we 'll have all the time ... in the world . Oh Pinocchio , we 'll do so many fun things together , like playing . I 'm going to create the most wondrous toys for you . - Will we play ball ? - Sure . And all sorts of games . I 'll make up bedtime stories for you . - Funny ones , scary ones ... - With bug-eyed monsters ? ! If you like ... And we 'll explore the world together . - The jungle , the mountains ... - And then you 'll grow up , and ... you 'll get married , and Spencer will be your wedding photographer . Grow up ? Spencer , you know he can never grow up . Oh , I ... - Why ? - Son ... You see , I 'm afraid you 'll never ask me to button up your coat ... because it 's cold outside . But ... I don 't have a coat . I think what Doc is trying to tell you , Pinocchio ... is ... is that you 'll never be ... Cool . Firecrackers ! I feel good . Who died ? Is this a funeral ? Mom ! Easy , robo-boy . I ain 't nobody 's Mama . I 'm just the local ... fairy . Turn around , boy . Let me have a look at ya . Very design , Geppetto . But then again , you 're Italian . Looks like my toaster . I love chrome . So , what 's he do ? I mean does he do housework ? Heavy lifting ? No , no . He 's my son . How do you know my name ? Cyberina always keeps up with current events . Cyberina ? Spencer , doll , close that beak before you catch a fly . Look at my coils ! Did I really program this ugly ' do ? Recoil ! There ... - I can do tricks too . - Oh really ? And I can name the 23 galaxies in the Union of Astral Nations ... - in reverse alphabetical order . - Oh , impressive . Of course , he 'll also go to school like all little boys ! Hello ? Like all little boys ? Geppetto , you DO remember he 's a robot . - I love him like my own son . - You 're my Dad . I love you too . Alright , Geppetto ! Programming love is quite an art . Pinocchio , you know your Dad 's dearest wish ... And I know this because I 'm a fairy , and we are clairvoyant His biggest wish for you is to be a real boy . You know I can make his dream come true . What do you say ? - Sure ! - Good . But , first you have ... to learn the difference between right and wrong . No sweat . Load the program ! I 'm a super-quick learner . Slow down that hard drive , honey . It 's not that easy . Learning right from wrong is something you have to FEEL for yourself . Now , I can give you a couple of hints , reminders really . You 'll get it eventually , honey . Your Dad has given you a sharp mind and a warm heart . Now you just put them together and I 'm sure it 'll come to you . - You can do it , son . - And once you have ... I 'll turn you into a real kid . - Deal , cyber-boy ? - Saved to memory ! - Where 'd she go ? - Out there and in here . Don 't worry . It 's not as hard as you think to learn right from wrong . Granny Penguindolyn used to say , " There are 9 ways to skin a cat " ... Spencer ! ... Of course , being a penguin , she could never skin a cat ... SPENCER ! She couldn 't even hit a nail on the head . - Zip it ! - Sorry . Chair . Tomorrow , you 'll go to school . But now , it 's time to close your eyes and sleep . Sleep ? ! Close my eyes and sleep . Saved to memory . They think they can mock me ? A simple blackout and those little brats turn their back on me ? ! Oh no . Now , they have a problem . A major problem . Major problem . - What problem , boss ? - Me ! I want you two to go ... to the school , get every one of those pint-sized parasites ... - back to Scamboland right now ! - We 're on it , boss ! Not yet , you component ! Helppppp ... Now , just be yourself at school . School bag . A-And listen to what your teacher says . Calm down , Doc . Now remember , chew your food ten times ... - before you speak . - But robots don 't eat . Don 't mix him up with your sayings , Spencer . - Doesn 't my son look good ? - Say " Cheese ! " Hurry . You 're going to be late . Bye Dad . - My son ... in school ... - You should be proud , Mr. Geppetto . Scamboville is so big and beautiful , Spencer . All the skyscrapers and , and flying machines ... - There 's so much to look at . - Watch out , Pinocchio ! And all the activity everywhere ... I just love it here . Listen to all those noises . It 's so alive . It gives me a feeling of being safe and secure . Is everything OK , Spencer ? Pinocchio ... You have to wait for the flashing light to come on before you can cross . Wait for the flashing light to come on , before I cross . Saved to memory . Does that mean it 's " wrong " to cross at a flashing light ? Yesiree . Very wrong ! - Then why are they stopped ? - Well , b-b-b-because it 's different for them . So , sometimes a flashing light means stop , sometimes it means go ? Not exactly . I-I mean , I mean , yes , yes , well sort of , sort ... It-It depends . It depends . Spencer , I think I have a memory conflict . As my Great-Aunt Arctica used to say : " There are no right conflicts . Just wrong solutions . " Saved to memory ... But , could you run what 's right and what 's wrong past me one more time ? - Well , to make a short story long ... - My fellow citizens ... Scamboland is in full operation now and open for all ... of Scamboville 's children . Now that 's wrong . Everything that man says is wrong . You can 't trust him . He 's always up to tricks , no treats . His name is ... - -Mayor Scamboli . Tickets ! Get your free tickets for Scamboland ! Free tickets for Scamboland ! Who doesn 't have one ? - Me ! - You don 't need one , you rivet . Free tickets for Scamboland ! - No thanks . - I want a ticket ! Stay away from them , Pinocchio . - Oh , I did wrong again ? - No , but as Aunt Penguicillin says : 'Never take a ticket that 's a token to a wrong turn ! ' - Wrong turn ? - Hey Spencey , - who 's the kiddie robot ? - A toy ? ! Can I play with him ? Quiet , wing nut ! - They 're funny ! - Remember , Doc Geppetto ... - wants you to go to school . - Mr . Geppetto ? ! - Geppetto builds great robots . - Let 's see how tough he is . Over here ! Ok , cyber-duck . You are toast ! As Uncle Penguini says : " If you can 't join them , beat it ! Hasta la pasta , baby ! " CABBY ! Wind me back uuuuuup . - I 'll pick you up here at 5 . - Saved to memory . - Mr . Geppetto really made you ? - He 's my Dad . My name 's Pinocchio . Look , he invented this for me . It 's called a funbrella . It makes any day sunny . It even makes bad moods go away . Hi Cynthia ! Hi Zach ! Love your umbrella . - What 's a robot doing at school ? - I 'm a kid just like everybody else . What a funny trick ! Sorry . I 'm just a clumsy robot . H-He 's funny . Who needs Scamboland now that we have Pinocchio ! He may be funny , but he 's just another geeky robot . Oh yeah ? ! I 've got a P3K Imagination module , the latest technology ! Imagination ? ! You 've got to be kidding . That 's a human thing . A robot wouldn 't get it . Come on , Pinocchio . We 'll be late for school . Follow me ... and I 'll prove to you that ... a robot has no more imagination than a can-opener . Pinocchio , are you gonna let her challenge you like that ? ! We 'll show her robots aren 't dumb , heh heh , right ? Right ! ... Uh , I 'd like to , but I promised Dad I 'd go to school . Poor robot promised his Daddy . Pinocchio ? ! Pretty cool ride , huh ? Uh , wasn 't scared . Not ... much . I 'll be fine in a minute , Rodo . Ready to be beaten at the Imagination Game ? How do you play ? You 'll see . Come on ! - Bow to the audience . - What audience ? I knew it ! No imagination . Cyberina ! Ladies and Gentlemen ! Welcome to the Imagination Game ! On my right ... the reigning champion ... Maaaarleeene ! And on my left ... embarking on his first flight of imagination ... Piiiii ... Aren 't you supposed to be in school , honey ? - Oh , yeah , well ... - Piii .. nooooo ... chio ! May the best imagination win ! But ... I still don 't know how to play . It 's a piece of cake , robo-boy . It 's like flying . Just open your wings and instead of flapping ' ... you imagine . - Imagine ? - Yes ! What 's the difference Between a robot and a man ? What 's the difference ? What 's the difference Between a program And a heart ? What 's the difference Between me and you ? I got my own emotions I 'm dancing like a puppet I 'm so fast with connections Speeding like a rocket My world is only fiction There 's one thing I can 't do With my imagination I 'm gonna make it true What 's the difference Between the machine and a smile What 's the difference ? What 's the difference Between a program And a heart ? What 's the difference Between me and you ? Let the music play Let me do it my way It 's my intuition Let the music play Let me go my way I feel that emotion I 'm gonna have some fun Let the music Let the music Control Let the music Control Your body , your soul - I gotta admit , you 're pretty good . - You weren 't so bad either . Very , very hip , both of you . What do you say , audience ? But , there can only be one winner of the Imagination Game ... and that winner is ... Maaaaaaar-leeeeeeeene ! No ! This is lame . I was better than her ! Hey ! Keep the stupid medal , zinc head . I knew it . You 're just a ... robot . - So , who won ? - Ask Pinocchio . - He knows better than everybody else . - Hurray ! Pinocchio won ! Yo , robots ! I won fair and square ! You don 't say . I imagined 56,232 terraplops of information . She only imagined 40 thousand , 41 tops . Honey , when you lose the fight , takin ' the medal ain 't right . - But , my ideas were better . - You 're a naughty little ' bot ! Oh yeah ? Well , I like being a robot . Who wants to be a boy , anyway ! And I won no matter what you say . Imagination game ... - Way to go , Pinocchio ! - Can I have your autograph ? Well , to be totally honest , Marlene won . Her ideas were better . I promised to go to school . I better get back there . Forget school . I think the boss should meet you . - The boss ? - Mayor Scamboli , of course . Scamboli ? ! I 'm not supposed to listen or talk to him . Spencer says he 's bad . And always wrong - Do you want the boss to hear ya ? ! - But I- - - That 's ridiculous . The boss is good and always right . Now , come on . Wait ! Let me compute this out . You say he 's good . Spencer says he 's bad ... This must be like the flashing light . It depends . Yes . Saved to memory . Ok , Rodo . Let 's go . It 's so tall ! So , this is the famous Pinocchio ! You 're so much smaller than your hologram . I mean ... just , just a ... a bit smaller . What is this imagination game where you beat my daughter ? Marlene is your daughter ? I don 't deserve the medal . She won it . I like this robot . Of course she won . She 's the Mayor 's daughter . What 's so special about a Mayor ? A Mayor watches over the entire city . That 's us down there ! - Could I see my house on here ? - Nothing to it . Hey ! That 's Dad . Dad , over here ! He can 't hear you . But we can hear him . My poor Pinocchio . Where is he ? I hope nothing bad has happened . Dad ! - So , you like games ? - I know . - I was supposed to be in school . - Not at all ! I mean why go to school when you can go to ... - well Scamboland , for instance ? - Cabby and Rodo already ... - gave me tickets . - We did , boss . We did . I wish the other children were like you . But they won 't listen to me . At least we do , boss . You can always count on robots . We know how to obey , and ... We 're smart . Yes , the robot is truly man 's best friend . Life would be great , if kids were more like us . You 've got a good point , Pinocchio . I couldn 't agree with you more . I-I 've made an important decision . You are going to be the star of Scamboland . - Me ? ! Why me ? - Kids need a friend . A robot to entertain them . And you 're just right for the job . - Right ? - Accept , Pinocchio , accept !

Two kids in every car . No shoving . Yeah ! What 's happening ? ! How do you like my little Scambobots ? Cute , aren 't they ? Of course , I couldn 't have done it without you , maestro , your brilliant research was so useful to me . You 're a genius of an inventor . It 's almost a pity your relevance to me is over . But you have a few minutes left . Sit back and enjoy the show . Oh , you want to join the fun ? It 's designed for kids . Of course , I-I could make an exception in your case .

We 're going home , Marlene . What ? But , where 'd all the kids go , Uncle Scamboli ? Don 't you ever call me Uncle again . But I-I- - And stay away from my daughter , robot . I 'll hang out with whoever I want . Don 't waste your time with a failed experiment of Geppetto 's . I 'll give you real robots for friends . Pinocchio 's no failure . And he 's my friend whether you like it or not . Come on , Pinocchio . Standing up to your father for me like that ... You 've got guts . This is my garden . I love it here . It cheers me up when I 'm sad . Do you get sad often ? Well , it isn 't easy with a father like mine . I love him , but ... sometimes I wonder if he loves me as much as those two dumb robots . That 's ok , they are dumb . I love my Dad , too . Though , I wish he would have come to see my show . I love to lie here and gaze up at the peaceful stars . And pretty soon , my problems don 't seem so bad . I know I 'm still just a robot , but if I could have a friend , I 'd want her to be just like you . Good night . Pinocchio ? No ! Stop ! You 're not allowed in here . They 're destroying the last piece of green in Scamboville and you laugh ! ? A-At least it doesn 't tickle . - You really are a robot . - Alright , I 'm a robot . I like metal . You like metal ? Here ! I don 't need a circuit board for a friend . A-And I don 't need a ... tree-hugger for a friend . Robots know how to appreciate metal . - Cabby ! Rodo ! Can I help ? - Sure ! We could use an extra hand . Deadbolt , we are not supposed to speak to him . W-What are you talking about ? Come on . It 's time for our next show . - The kids must be waiting . - You don 't get it , do you ? - No . - Remember when you told the boss- - Life would be great , if kids were more like us . Well , I guess you got your wish . Aren 't they cute ? No ! It can 't be . You 're lying ! Your nose should be growing ! Scamboli ! How could you ? ! Cyberina ! Please help me ! Dad ! I 've got to find Dad ! Hey ! That 's my shuttle ! Okay , let me think . If I push this to go up ... No ... Okay , maybe pull down to ... That was close ! Flashing light means I go . Pursuing an unidentified driver . Oh , I wonder what this is for ? " When the flasher goes off , I stop ! " I am ushering in a new technological - Some drivers ... Hello , Pinocchio . Lovely day , isn 't it ? Not right now , House . - Oh , Pinocchio ! - Spencer ? Where 's Dad ? He isn 't with you ? Oh , yeah yeah , not good , not good . He left for Scamboland to get you away from Scamboli . - I haven 't heard from him since . - It 's all my fault . I thought Scamboli was my friend . Spencer , we have to get to Scamboland and find Dad fast ! Come out with your hands up . You are under arrest for reckless driving . Oh no . A Scambocop . Hello Officer , lovely day , isn 't it ? I am arresting you for reckless driv- - You see Officer , a-a-a-as my cousin , Sean Pennguin says : " You have to break some rules to make an omelet . " - For the last time- - - " Time " ? It 's always time for a good cup of coffee . Thanks , house . Hurry , Spencer ! Dyiiii ... Freeze ! Only Geppetto could have invented a robot even worse than a child . But now that little interfering gearbox has gone too far . Come on ! Well , a glimmer of brains for once , you rivet ! I thought I forbade you to - - Was the idea to use Pinocchio to soften me up ? A robot . - I should have known . - You two . Outside . One day , you 'll thank me . For destroying every last piece of nature ? Stay here ! Yes . There 's much less maintenance now ... You 're going through a green phase , darling . I can understand that , but I 'm simplifying life for you . Take the children , for example . Are you still here ? ! What about the children ? You two . Back in here ! - I 've turned them into robots ! - You 've WHAT ? ! Trust me . It 's for their own good . And I 'm going to program them all to be your friends , like Cabby and Rodo . Stop it ! It 's all wrong ! Don 't you see that ? ! What are you two doing here ? Get out ! Stay ! I see that I 've tried my best to build a better world for my daughter , and she thinks it 's all a failure and that I 'm not a very good father . Oh , Daddy . For just once , couldn 't you do something good ? I 'm trying . Then free the children , Daddy . Bring them back . This discussion is over . Come on ! Daddy ! Dad ! Daaad-dy ! Doc Gepppppettttto ! Daddy ! Help me , please ! I have to find my father ! Do you know where he is ? My little Scambobots won 't listen . Too bad . Maybe THIS is what you 're looking for . You 're a monster , Scamboli ! I prefer to think of myself as a practical man . And practically speaking , I don 't need you any more . Why don 't we dismantle him for spare parts . Catch him ! Hold it right there , Scambobots ! I think someone else should have the honor of taking Pinocchio apart . Metal suits you , Geppetto-bot . No ! Not Dad . You-You can 't . Correction , minibot . I HAVE ! Say cheese ! You two ! Catch them or I 'll turn you into key chains ! - Yeah , on it , boss ! - Don 't worry , Dad , I 'll be back . I 've got him ! This way , Spencer ! In here . Follow me . The Tunnel of Danger . Excellent choice , Pinocchio . I don 't like the looks of this place . Careful , Pinocchio ! Don 't forget Scamboli built this ride . The penguin 's right . Welcome to the Tunnel of Danger . The rules are simple . I create obstacles , you avoid them . If you crash , you go to the big scrapyard in the sky . Now for the fun part . I like hot rides ... but not THIS hhhhhhhooootttt ! - We 're gonna crash ! - That 's right . Bye bye . Not quite yet ! This game was meant to be played by two sides , wasn 't it , Daddy ? - Hang on , Pinocchio . - Marlene ? ! Now this is better . This reminds me of home . Robots rule ! Go Pinocchio ! You screwdriver ! We 're rootin ' for the boss . Only two more to go and we win ! Unfortunately , you forget who designed this game . You 're cheating ! Now , you are the obstacles ! Pinocchio ... When you lose the fight , takin ' the medal ain 't right . Do you like metal ? Here ! Come on , Spencer . You won , Pinocchio . You rule ! Looks like you lost , Daddy . Now , free the children ! Lost ? Oh no . Scamboli never loses . Lost ... Pinocchio ! I 'll turn you into a tin can and stuff you with penguin meat ! Scambobots ! Catch them . Cabby ! Rodo ! Coming , boss . I think you dropped this . - Where 's my remote ? - It 's over there . I just gave it to- - You just WHAT ? ! That 's the last straw . You 're fired ! Both of you ! - But ... - Come on , CABBY ! No ! Back off ! - Need a ride ? - Marlene ! Yeah ! Stop it ! Get out . Go away , you little brats ! It 's not over yet . Pull over . Oh no . Then take this . Dad ! Are you alright ? This is Mr. Geppetto ? ! Oh Doc , I 'm so happy I 'm flightless , I mean speechful , I , no I AM flightless , but I meant speechless , although I AM speaking ... He says to zip it ! Great idea , Dad ! I 'm all over it . - Where is he going ? - Don 't worry . He knows what he 's doing . Help me get the robots together . Come on guys , line up ! Ah , this brings back the ' berg . All of us walking in rows . Hang on and enjoy the ride . Don 't worry , Marlene . It 's cool . Dad and me have it all together . - Thank you ! - Dad ! You 're great ! Thank you , Mr. Geppetto ! Three cheers for Doc ! He deserves a m-m-m-medal for courage ... above and beyond the call of n-nature ! It 's your turn now . Yes ! Go for it , Mr. Geppetto ! It 's your turn ! Your future lies behind you , Doc ! Something 's wrong ! Careful , Pinocchio ! My Scottish cousin Pen McGuin says , if it ain 't fixed , don 't break it . Dad ! Can you hear me ? ! He hears you ... but not for much longer ! You again . Leave my Dad alone . Dad ? You 're getting on my nerves , minibot . O-Ok . You do win , Scamboli . You 're more powerful . I 'm glad you 've finally seen the light , but it 's way too late for flattery , robot . You 're so strong and , and you have such a handsome profile ! True , of course , and credit to you for noticing it , but it won 't save you . Scamboli knows no pity . You 're the best , Scamboli ! You 're skillful more intelligent than any robot . You always win ! Nooooo ! Look what I 've done to you , Dad . I 'm so sorry . It 's all my fault . Wha - What is happening here ? Cyberina ! Well who were you expecting , really ? The tooth fairy ? Geppetto , honey , are you trying to become one of your own experiments ? Ooh , my , my my , looks like you 've been doin ' a little fibbing ' . It 's true . But I only did it to save Dad . I see . So , tell me robo-boy , have you learned anything yet about right and wrong ? I wish I had , but I just made a total mess . I even helped Scamboli . That 's why my dad ended up like this . You know , I think your Dad would be very , very proud of you . Now , do you remember what I promised ? After all those years of service ... Frankly , I don 't mind not takin orders from him any more . True ... - But , whose orders do we follow now ? - Our own , you washer ! Look , I obey me , and you obey ... me . Marlene ! Spencer ! Look ! I 'm a real boy ! What about me ? - Don 't I deserve a hug ? - Dad ! My son . Poor Daddy ... What have you done to yourself ? Well , he loves robots so much , he must be happy to be one . Spencer ! Don 't worry , Marlene . A few days of robot life can 't hurt him . - There 's a saying , Scamboli-bot ... - Of your Uncle Penguini 's ? No . Of my own , Spencer T. Penguin .

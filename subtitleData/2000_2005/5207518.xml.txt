 Why don 't you stare at this for a little while , you ugly bastard ? - What are you doing here ? - I 'm taking the specimen . You can 't . I haven 't prepped the cryostasis chamber . I don 't want him frozen , Rowan . I want him soft . - We 've already discussed this . - Yeah . Well , I had to go over your head . I 'm moving him to our Scranton facility . You can 't risk transporting him through open country . - This isn 't open for discussion . His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue I mean , it just cries out for more research . And you 'll risk the deaths of innocent civilians if he escapes ? Yes . But I 'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his men can handle the transfer just fine . - Sergeant ? - Everything is under control , ma 'am . - Dr. Wimmer , please . - Rowan , he 's no longer your problem . Can we get that rag off him ? What the hell ? Aah ! Oh , my God ! Get out of here . What happened ? I 'm sorry . Cryogenic breach . Emergency lockdown . Oh , God , no . No . Kay-Em ? - No viruses , no bacteria . No toxins . It 's clean . - It 's still cold . - Wow . Someone want to tell me what that is ? It 's like a big kind of frozen storage thing . Probably a cryostasis unit . I 'd guess early port series . Kay-Em ? Quadroport 11 . Manufactured in 2010 . Precise historic records are inconsistent . - Anyone thinking what I 'm thinking ? - Open it up . - What the hell is that ? - Humanoid . Organic composition is unclear . Can someone tell me what 's on his face ? Uh , some kind of 20th-century carbon filtration unit ? - It 's a hockey mask . - Very good , Tsunaron . - What 's a hockey mask ? - Facial armor . Used in a sport outlawed in 2024 . Amazing . Absolute museum quality . - Are you paying attention , Azrael ? - Yeah . Well , don 't touch anything . Guys , we got another body here . - Kay-Em ? - She 's perfectly preserved . Cell crystallization is at 25 percent . Twenty-five percent ? Suggest extensive nanotech and phase one cell reconstruction . Wait a minute , are you saying that we can bring her back to life ? - Yes . But she is deteriorating . Opening the door has compromised her hibernation . Lou , get ready for dust-off . We have a priority evac . - Copy that , ready in five . - Not five , now . Ah . What the ... ? - Look out . - Whoa , whoa . Fifty-five eds of etherene . You 'll be fine . Fine ? I 'm missing my arm ! Ah . Ah . Oh . You 're so pretty . - Kicker , are the doors secure ? - Locked and blocked . Beautiful . Liftoff in three , two ... Yeah . I love this part . - What did you find ? - Won 't believe it . Get the sarge on the horn . Did you hear ? Division 4 just entered the occupied zone . - Casualties ? - Minimal . I 'd love to know how we got this screwed-up gig . Yeah , well , I didn 't join the corps to become a freaking babysitter . Brodski here . Sarge , we found a viable . - Say again ? - We found two bodies in deep cryostasis . The Kay-Em unit thinks we can resuscitate the female . Female ? - Yeah . - Crutch , do you copy ? Crutch , do you read me ? Crutch , wake the hell up . - What ? - They 're on their way back . Prepare for docking and power up the lab . Mm . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Whatever . - So , what does she look like ? - She 's cute . - Yeah , and single . - Mm-hm . I 'm so lonely . We need to get her to the lab . - You think you can bring her back ? - We 'll find out , sergeant . You 're not gonna bring him back , are you ? No , it 's impossible . - Oh , shit . I forgot my arm . - Yeah , here you go , dumb-ass . Heh . Hi , hand . - Any idea how long she 's been down ? - Four-point-five-five centuries . Must 've been one hell of a wake-up call . - I 'm bitchy as hell when I wake up . - Did you just wake up ? Kinsa . - Ahh . You guys always find the cool shit . - Where 's Waylander ? - Uh , he 's in Lab 1 charging the bed now . Good , find Stoney and Adrienne and get to Lab 2 . - Yep . Once we 're in the clear , I 'd like to check your circuits . - Oh , I 'll bet you would . - It isn 't like that . - Adrienne , good . I need you in Lab 2 . - You found something ? - Two viables . - In what condition ? Perfect . Attempting reanimation with one . What can I do ? - You , Stoney , Kinsa- - - Ah . They 're second year . - They 'll slow me down . - Walk them through it . Run a complete structural scan , log them in , put them in stasis . - I 'll check back with you later . - Fine . - Where are we ? - The board 's all green , teach . - N-2 's warm and ready . - Good . Kay-Em , begin stabilizing any cellular fractures . Yes , professor . Janessa , I need a full scan . Glycerol levels , cerebral perfusion , the whole works . - I live to serve . - Let 's see what we 're dealing with here . Decrystalization of the membranes is now at 32 percent . Good . Somebody get those clothes off her . Oh , I got it . I got it . Honestly . Waylander , where 's her diffusion barriers ? Uh ... - Seventeen and stable . - Here we go . Stay still or you 'll end up getting an elbow where your wrist should be . Specimen 4420 found in Sector 3930 L on Earth prime . Subject discovered in complete cryo-suspension . - How 's it going ? - Good , man . What 's up ? - Hey , where do you want this ? - On the specimen table . - Hi , baby . - Hey , gorgeous . Initiating scan . - Mm . Smart and sexy . - Mm . Professor , take a look at this guy 's scan . - Amazing . - How does he function with a brain that small ? - Way manages . - That 's very funny . - He 's a big boy . - I bet he 's hung like a mammoth . Mm . Okay , guys . Just get the hell out of here and come back when you 're more focused . - You serious ? - Yes , just go . - Thanks , Adrienne . Come . - Thanks . Don 't mention it . See what you can salvage from the optic cortex , then move on . My pleasure , professor . Ready phase two . Bring on the ants . That 's it . Come to Mama . Temperature 96.2 , 97 . Cool , it 's working . Ninety-eight-point-six and holding . Cell reconstruction is complete . Internal defib in three two , one . Easy , easy . Vital signs are normal and strong . No shit . Easy . - Easy . - Did you get him ? - Where is he ? Tell me you got him . - Got who ? No one is here . You 're safe with us . There was a leak in the cryo unit and ... - Was it contained ? - It was contained . But when the cryo unit ruptured , you didn 't escape it . It put you into stasis . For how long ? The year is 2455 . Now , I know this is a huge shock , but you 're gonna be safe here . You 're aboard Grendel , a class-four catamaran transport ship . We 're on our way back home and you 're gonna be just fine . 2455 ? That 's over 400 years . Secure line . Perez , Dieter . Solaris Research Station . Connect . Lowe , you bastard . We 've hit the mother lode . - Do you know what time it is ? - I don 't care . We 've got a gold mine . A box of DVDs is not a gold mine . I 've told you , I can 't move them . Just look at the file . Two 400-year-old frozen specimens . One well preserved . The other one- - Are you ready for this ? - -Up and walking around . Four hundred years old and walking around . Yeah , 455 years , to be exact . Who cares ? Who gives a shit ? People . - People will pay huge money to see her . - Let me ask you a question . Is this the first person you 've reanimated ? Of course not . How many people are out there today walking around thawed out and looking good ? - Hundreds . - Thousands . Maybe , but not 450 years old . She 's nearly twice as old as anyone on the planet . Two-fifty , 450 , what 's the difference ? Doctor , a hundred years ago when reanimation was more unpredictable , sure , maybe . But now it 's old news . Damn it . I need money . Oh , I know , I know . The other viable is marked " Voorhees . " That 's not Jason Voorhees , is it ? - What do you know about him ? - Jason Voorhees . He killed nearly 200 people and simply disappeared without a trace . Why , to the right buyer , he could be worth a fortune . I 've got him frozen here on the ship . - You work out a list of ownership ? - No list . He 's my find . He 's mine . - What about your students ? - Well , they 're students . The educational experience will be enough . Doctor , doctor , you are one son of a bitch . Soon to be one rich son of a bitch . Lowe out . Professor I think that , uh , we need to talk about my midterm . Aw , poor baby . No wonder you wore this thing . Harder . Harder . - Who 's been a naughty little boy ? - Lhave . - Oh . Harder . - You want it a little harder ? - Yeah ? How 's that ? Yeah ? - Yeah . Yeah . Oh , good . That 's it . That 's it , right there ? Daddy likes it hard ? Oh , yeah , yeah . - Daddy wants it hard , huh ? - Yeah . Yeah . - Yeah ? You like it right there ? - Oh , yeah . That 's it , yeah . - A little harder for Daddy ? - Yeah . Yeah ! - Come on . Come on . - Yeah . Yeah . You pass ! - What do you think ? - Hmm ? Do you like them ? They 're fine . Look , Kay-Em , I don 't think this is going to work . - Why do you want those things anyways ? - Janessa has them . - Well , Janessa 's ... - Real ? Yes . Let 's not complicate things , all right ? I like you just the way you are . I think you 're perfect . Okay . Help , Wayland ! No ! Somebody help me ! Help me ! No , no , no ! I brought you something to eat . Not much longer and we 'll be at Earth 2 . Earth 2 ? What happened to Earth 1 ? Is , uh , dead . The oceans , the soil , neither will sustain life . Can I do anything else for you ? Wanna tell me what happened down there ? I take it being stabbed and frozen wasn 't part of your plan . I 'm a ... I was a project leader at Crystal Lake Research . - The subject was Jason Voorhees . - Jason Voorhees ? Notorious murderer ? We executed him for the first time in 2008 . - For the first time ? - Mm-hm . We tried everything . Electrocution , gas , firing squad . We even hung him once . Nothing worked . It was decided that if we couldn 't terminate him , we 'd contain him . Cryogenic stasis . Freeze him until we could figure out what to do . - Seems sensible . - I thought so . But unfortunately , some people who were too smart for their own good felt that a creature that couldn 't be killed was simply too valuable to just file away . In the end , it always comes down to money . How do you thank someone who gives you back your life ? Well , you 're gonna be alive for a long time . We 'll figure out something , heh . Why don 't you just admit it ? You want me . I could never be with a girl whose balls are bigger than mine . Guys , our star patient is back . Rowan , this is Tsunaron and Janessa . - Hi . - Hi . Hi . I see that my clothes fit okay . Oh , these are yours . They 're great . Thank you . Whoa , heh . - What are those ? - These are Janessa 's love children . Ha-ha-ha . You see , now , it is that wit of yours that is what repels all human females . Of course , you 've met Sergeant Brodski . - Yes . Hi again . - Hi . And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14 , Tsunaron 's little lovebot . Easy , Janessa . Kay-Em is a knowledge matrix android that I have been programming . Amazing . - She looks so real . - I am real . - Professor , where do you want this ? - Lab 2 . - Sure . - Oh , whoa . Where did you get that ? Uh , from your friend . The big guy with the hockey mask . - You brought him on board ? - He 's in the next lab . We 're quite safe . - Safe ? - Our scans reveal him to be very dead . Could your scans be wrong ? You should just get rid of him . He 's too dangerous . Well , that would be irresponsible and foolhardy . He 's a valuable scientific artifact that must be carefully preserved . Much like yourself . He is an unstoppable killing machine . He 's not dead . Believe me . He 's definitely dead . Show me . I 'm putting us on lockdown . Attention , we have a hostile on board . Grunt Team , report to weapons . The chick ? Repeat , we have a hostile on board . Grunt Team , report to weapons . - Everyone else , get to Lab 1 . - Ugh . - Baby , I 'm not ready yet . - Well , hurry up . Sarge , Grunt Team 's assembled . Dallas is a no-show . - Where the hell is he ? - I don 't know . - Damn . - Look , sergeant , we need to talk . - Do you have all your kids ? - Yes . Oh , God . Stoney . Stoney is dead . - Oh , my God . - Stoney is dead . Kicker , I want full armor and tac . I want nothing left of this guy by the time we reach Solaris . - Roger that . You heard him , grunts ? Move . Whoa , nothing left of him ? What have you got in mind ? Take your kids to Lab 1 and stay there till you hear from me . Heh , heh . I just saved your ass . You know , don 't get cocky . You must really feel like a wuss , huh , there , big boy ? Hey , check the score , kid . It 's still 9-3 . Yeah , but I got my groove on now . You know what I 'm saying ? - So , what do you say next kill wins ? - Lock and load , killer . You 're going down . You are so going down . What the hell ? - I thought this was an alien sim . - Yeah , it is . Pause play . I said , pause play . - He 's not pausing . - Yeah , no kidding . I think we need to reboot . - Ha-ha-ha . - That does not count as a kill . Yes , it does . Okay , screw this . Game over . What the hell ? Hey , drop the kid ! Drop the kid now ! Azrael , get out of here ! - I got him . I got him . - Azrael , I 've got no shot ! Move ! - Sergeant Brodski . - Don 't leave those kids alone . - What 's the matter with you ? - We 're less than an hour from Solaris . They have fully equipped tactical units that are more than capable of taking care of this . - I say we wait and sedate him . - I am taking this guy out . - Sergeant , I need him alive . - No , you want him alive . - What you need is to get out of my way . - Look , there are other considerations . Financial considerations . My only consideration is the safety of the people on this ship . All right , 100,000 . Two hundred . - Five . - Five ? - Kicker , Dallas not here yet ? - Nope . You , Briggs , find him . Bring him up to speed . Condor , you have a BFG ? You 're with me . Sven , Geko , you got the starboard pontoon . Sarge , what do we do when we find this guy ? Well , I promised the doc we 'd take him alive . After you blow him to hell , put one in his leg so we can say we tried . Yeah . Whoo ! Oh , Lord . Sarge , I got Dallas . Where the hell is he ? - He 's dead . Sarge , we got a body in Bay 2 . - Who is il ' ? - It 's AZrael . What the hell 's going on here ? Sarge , we got a blood trail heading toward the cargo bay . Condor , Kicker and I will take cargo main . The rest of you take portside . I hope they know what they 're doing . These guys live for this stuff . Sorry . - Don 't do that . - Dude . - What ? - You scream like a girl . - Screw you . - You wish . Lou , is that you ? Lou , I swear , you mess with an engineer , you 're gonna wake up in the morning with a waste hose in your bunk . Asshole . What the hell ? Crutch , get down now ! - What the hell 's going on here ? - Crutch , out now . Aw , you wrecked my stuff , man . - We nailed him . - He 's gotta be here . Condor , airborne . Briggs . Where the hell 's Sven ? Condor , anything topside ? Negative , sarge . There 's no sign of him . This isn 't gonna work . Keep your eyes peeled . Everything 's under control . Condor , report . Sven , report . Condor , report . Report ! Damn . Sarge , we found Condor . What 's his condition ? He 's screwed . Let 's smoke this fucker . Sarge , Sven 's dead . Jesus . - You have got to get them out of there . - They know what they 're doing . Oh , man . Geko . Geko . I got him ! I got him ! Ha-ha-ha . Yes , yes . See , they got him . Don 't take your eyes off him . I 'm on my way . Take your time , sarge . He ain 't going nowhere . Briggs get out of here . Kicker . Briggs . Where are you , damn it ? He 's all alone in there . It 's gonna take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog . Aah ! Yeah , that ought to do it . Such a waste . I told him to stay calm . To wait until we got to Solaris , and then we could take care of this monster . I said , don 't go in unprepared . Brodski was just too proud . Who locked the damn door ? Somebody wanna tell me what the hell is going on ? Grunts are dead . - Which ones ? - All of them . Oh . Oh , man . Lou , how long till we reach Solaris ? I 'm taking us out of hyperdrive right now . Kids and their goddamn field trips , you know ? Heh . Just bring a psycho on board . Yeah , sure . I just know I 'm gonna get blamed for this shit . Solaris to Grendel , we have you on approach . Stand by for docking number . Solaris , we need military and medical at the gate . We got a big problem here . Real goat-fuck . Grendel , what 's your problem ? What 's your problem ? Look , we 're gonna be all right . He 's trapped in the cargo bay . We 're locked up in here . - Can the Solaris grunts kill him ? - Absolutely . I 've been in constant contact with Solaris . They have 60 highly trained professionals standing by to get us off this ship . Solaris to Grendel , pull up . Abort docking . You 're coming in too fast . - Grendel- - - What now ? - Warning . Prepare for impact . - Oh , shit . Hang on ! Aah ! What 's going on ? What the hell 's going on ? - Everyone okay ? - What just happened ? - Waylander . - Yeah . Yeah . It 's all right . We just overshot it . We 'll turn around and go back . Hang on . Oh , my God . - Solaris is gone . - Gone ? - It can 't be gone . - Look for yourself . It 's gone . What are we gonna do ? Lou , what sort of damage we looking at ? I 'm sending out a distress beacon . Lou ? Guys , we 've lost our entire port pontoon . The internal pressure is stable . - The main thrusters are off-line . - Life support ? - We should be okay for a while . - But he 's out there . Look , we 're gonna be fine . We 're in a high-volume traffic lane . Another ship 's gonna come by , I 'm sure of it . We 're gonna be safe here . Shut up ! - What are you doing ? - Shh . - Maybe he gave up . - You really think so ? Shh , Shh , shh . I don 't think he 's out there . Why don 't you just stick your head out and have a peek ? - Aah ! - Oh , my God ! Go ! Go ! Janessa , go ! Come on , go ! Move it , move it , move it ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Where is Professor Lowe ? Hi . Look , have you considered how valuable you are ? I mean , fame , money . With my help , you 're gonna have it all . Yeah , I know people , you know ? I mean , I have connections . Together we could make a fortune . We could ... Oh , shit . Oh . You want your machete back . Shit , it 's yours , take it . Heh . Just remember who saved it for you . Guys , it 's okay ! He just wanted his machete back ! Whew ! Um , I 'm gonna go back to my room , because Stoney 's gonna meet me there . Oh , man . All right , look . How do we get off this ship ? I don 't know . - Could you beam us off or something ? - Beam us off ? The shuttle . Hell , yeah . The shuttle . What about it , Crutch ? Uh , yeah , I can do prelaunch from the bridge . Good , the rest of us will head to the shuttle . We 'll start the launch list . I 'm with you , Crutch . Whoa , whoa , whoa . You know how to use that thing ? Yep . It 's just like riding a bike . - Once you learn , you never forget how . - Good . Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold . - Meet you at the shuttle bay . - See you there . Uh , what 's a bike ? Enough firepower here to level a moon . I say we pack this stuff up , head for the shuttle . What do you think ? Are we gonna make it ? Well , the statistical probability of survival is 12 percent . Twelve percent ? Can 't you come up with better odds than that ? - No . - Ugh , bullshit , Kay-Em ! That 's bullshit ! Well , preparation for launch may be a relatively simple procedure but getting there alive ? It is a problem . Are you telling me that there 's absolutely no chance for us to better our odds ? Statistical probability of survival just went up to 53 percent . Wanna go for 100 ? - He 's here . - Quiet . But if he 's in here , he 's gonna kill us and- - Quiet . One more sound and I 'll snap your neck myself . Got it ? She 's good with people . - Did you see that ? - What ? I think there 's someone still alive over there . We don 't have time for this . - Which way is the shuttle bay ? - Straight through . Go . I 'll meet you there . Just don 't wreck my pants . Come on , girl . We 're going home . Aw , Lou . Jesus , that 's twisted . Of course , I 've seen worse . Okay , let 's get to work . Brodski ? Okay . We 're gonna get you out of here . Oh , God . I 'm gonna go get help and I 'll be back . Give me your vest . - Oh . Bastard . - Hey . You 're lucky you weren 't alive during the Microsoft conflict . Hell , we were beating each other with our own severed limbs . That 's nice . Okay , let 's get us home . - Kinsa , are you there ? - Yes , ma 'am . - Crutch ? - Prepare for fuel transfers . - Cells 6 and 7 bypass . - Hydraulic lifters . Pressurized and dampened . - It 's Brodski , he 's alive . - No shit . Yeah . I can 't move him . Are Way and Crutch back ? - No , they 're still on the bridge . - I need help . Hey , guys , Brodski 's still alive , but Rowan can 't move him by herself . Go , go , go . I can handle it from here . Tell them I 'm on my way . Watch your back . Crutch , how are we doing for time ? With a giant shitload of good luck , we might be ready to go . Good . Rowan , hey . Where 's Brodski ? L- - He was here . I don 't get it . And I am going home . Lowe ! Ha-ha-ha . Oh , shit . I got company here , people- - Aah ! Let 's go . Kinsa , open the door . Open the damn door ! - Why aren 't you on board ? - Kinsa won 't open the door . I think that she 's finally lost it , and this is a really bad time for this ! Janessa , gently . Give me the com . Kinsa ? Kinsa , honey , it 's Rowan . I need you to open the door . No . Kinsa , sweetheart , it 's all over , honey . We can go home . All you need to do is open the door for us . No . Oh , shit . Come on , guys . Guys ! Jesus Christ , Kinsa ! Open the goddamn door ! Oh , no , Kinsa , no ! The fuel lines are still attached ! Kinsa ! Now what ? I ... - Um , now , basically , we die . - Bullshit . Okay , new plan . You hold him and I 'll run . Hey , slappy ! Got a little something for you . Oh , wow . Gave her an upload . Afraid I 'm gonna have to hurt you now . Kay-Em ! That , uh ... That didn 't go so well . Gotcha . Hey . Giddyap . Unh . I had it under control , but thanks . My pleasure . Yeah . - You did it . - Kay-Em . Who 's your mama ? All right ! - How you doing there , Brodski ? - I 'm all right . Come on , let 's get you patched up . What a mess . Lab 2 . - Tsunaron , is he gonna make it ? - Absolutely . He 's at 80 percent already . - This guy is strong . - Unh . What the hell ? Way ? We 've got trouble . The collision must have compromised the hull . She 's bleeding out . Oh , no , no , no . Tiamat to Grendel , do you read ? Over . Tiamat to Grendel , do you read ? Yes , uh , Tiamat , this is Grendel . We read you . Can you hear us ? That 's affirmative , Grendel . We are reading your distress beacon . - Are you in need of assistance ? - Heh , that 's very affirmative , Tiamat . How soon can you get here ? Our situation is extremely critical . We 're 4 parsecs away , Grendel . ETA 45 minutes . We don 't have that much time . Tiamat , this is Grendel . Our hull is bleeding out . We 're gonna have a core implosion in less than 30 minutes . Do you copy ? We copy you , Grendel . Advise how you would like us to proceed . We 're just gonna end up taking them down with us . Tiamat if you can 't get here in 30 minutes , then there 's no point . What ? Are you high ? Tiamat , this is Grendel . You just ignore that last idiot , all right ? You get your ass out here , okay ? You come here and you save us . Hey , guys , why can 't we just go over here ? It 's no good . The pontoon goes , it 'll take the bridge with it . Not if we disconnect these walkways . You can 't just disconnect them . We could blow it up . Plenty of macro charge in the weapons hold . This could work . Tiamat , we 're gonna try something here . If you 're game , maintain your current course and speed and hopefully we 'll see you when you get here . Copy . See you in 45 minutes . - Good luck , Grendel . - Thanks . Let 's blow the walkways . Come on . Let 's split up and set the charges . Who 's got the remote ? - Right here . - We 'll meet up in walkway B. Go . - All set . - Good to go . Hold together , baby . - Impossible . He 's dead . - I 'd say he got better . - He 's been modified . - Oh , you think ? - Can you take him ? - I can try . You guys might wanna run . Kay-Em ! No ! Waylander ! Brodski , get in here now ! Come on , guys ! Come on ! What the hell is going on ? Jason fucking Voorhees , that 's what 's going on . - Blow the charges ! - No , Waylander 's got the trigger ! Hey , asshole . I think she 's holding . I think we 're finally okay . I 'd clap if I could . Tiamat to Grendel . Come in , Grendel . We have you vectored for approach and emergency docking . You ready to get off that boat ? Yeah , let 's go home . - Holy shit ! We gotta go now ! - No ! Janessa ! - Janessa ! - Don 't let go ! Grab her hand ! - Janessa ! - Reach out ! Reach for it ! Come on ! Come on ! Oh , this sucks on so many levels ! - Aah ! - Janessa ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on . Janessa . Shit , he 's still coming . - Oh , God . - Shit , come on . Go ! Which way ? - This way . Come on . - Uh , this way , this way ! Come on . - Tiamat , we 're at the evac door . - So am I , Grendel . Lifeline secured . Initiate collar pressurization . Tiamat , open the outer doors . - Damn . - Oh , what now ? Tiamat , escape hatch won 't open . I 've got this . I 've got this . Let me try an override . Shit , shit , shit . Come on , come on . Our exterior motor 's got no power . - What does that mean ? - Means I 'm going EVA . EVA ? What 's EVA ? It 's a spacewalk . If he can jump the lines out there , we can reroute them . That door will open and we can get off this thing before it blows up . - Sounds like a good plan . - Tiamat , this is Grendel . Escape hatch is jammed . - Going EVA to try to patch it up . - You 'd better get a move on . - I 'm in the maintenance hatch . - We read you , sarge . Opening outer doors . Those hatches aren 't gonna keep him that much longer . We need to buy more time . You 're the expert on this guy , right ? - What are you thinking ? - A diversion . I 'm at the control panels . - Rowan , are you there ? - Yes . I 'm gonna divert main power supply unit and send it to you . Gotcha . See the bright blue diode ? Connect it to the terminal . - Aah ! - Uh , was that you or me ? That was another part of your hull , Grendel . - You are running out of time . - Okay , Tiamat , just a few more minutes . We can disengage and come around again . Negative , Tiamat . Just another minute . We 'll stand by as long as we can . Uh-oh . - You ready , Kay ? - I was built ready , baby . Initiate . It 's working . He 's buying it . - Whoops . - What do you mean , " whoops " ? - Nothing . - Not nothing . You don 't just say " oops . " What " oops " ? I think he saw me . If you 've got something brilliant up your sleeve , do it . I got something . I got something . Prepare variations using data file Crystal Lake , 1980 . - Kay ? - Here goes nothing . Initiate . - Hey , you want a beer ? - Or do you wanna smoke some pot ? Or we can have premarital sex . We love premarital sex . - Try it now , Rowan . - Here we go . You piece of crap ! He 's done with the campers . - Wow . He 's good . - He 's too good . He 's coming back . Okay , try it again . It 's engaged ! The door 's engaged . Brodski , you are the man . Hey , are we gonna see you sometime soon ? I 'm on my way . Brodski , where are you ? Grendel , we can 't keep pressure lock . - We 'll disengage in 40 seconds . - Kay - E m . Kay-Em . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six five , four , three , two , one . Clear ! - No ! No , wait ! - Disconnect . He 's coming this way . You 've gotta be kidding me . Brodski . He 's gone . I can 't believe it . - Tsun ? - Kay-Em . Are you okay ? I 'll be back on my feet in no time . As soon as I have some . I 'll get right on it . It 's beautiful . - Look at that . - A shooting star . Make a wish . It landed in the lake . Let 's go check it out .

 ( music through headphones ) Hey , now we 're talking . Hey , right here , man ! Right here ! Stop , you son of a ... You got highway hypnosis or something . You didn 't see me yelling ' and waving ' ? You better watch that . ( air brakes hiss ) Come on . What now ? Where 's everybody goin ' ? Is the toilet broken ? What ? Can someone please tell me what 's goin ' on here ? No . No ! No ! ( beep ) Damn . ( ringing tone ) - John Doggett . - Hey . | t 's Scully . Good morning . - Afternoon . I 've been trying to reach you . - Actually , I 'm out of town . I 'm north of Sugarville , Utah , roughly . Utah ? What are you doing there ? The local coroner wants a consultation on a murder victim . A man who was found beaten to death in the desert . Apparently , his corpse shows some anomalous characteristics . - Anomalous ? How ? - From what they 're telling me , he is a 22-year-old backpacker last seen by his family six months ago in perfect health . However , his body is now showing advanced signs of osteoporosis , arthritis and kyphosis of the vertebrae . - He 's got a spine of a 90-year-old woman . - Sounds anomalous , all right . - You didn 't need me to tag along ? - It was just a simple consultation . And he called me over the weekend , and I figured lwasn 't going to bother you . - Well , if there 's anything I can do from here . - Actually , there might be , if you don 't mind . Somewhere in our files there is an unsolved murder case . Unfortunately , I don 't remember any of the particulars , like where or when it took place , but I do remember that there were some glycoproteins found at the crime scene . - Glycoproteins . - Yeah . Mucus . But it was unable to be identified , and , as you recently read through all of our files , I thought it might ring a bell with you . I don 't have a great memory for mucus ... but I 'll be happy to look . Remember anything else ? Agent Scully ? - Agent Scully ? - I 'm sorry ? - Do you remember anything else ? - No , no . Just ... just mucus . When you find that file , will you fax it over to the Juab County Sheriff 's office ? That 's the best place to reach me . My cellphone isn 't working . - All right . You got it . - Thank you . Hello ? ( honks horn ) - How 're you doin ' ? - Good . Thanks . I , uh ... Iwas wondering ... A bus came through here a little while ago . Do you happen to know where it might have gone ? I was around back . - Do you know what 's up that road ? - Eventually Salt Lake , if you 're not in a hurry . Can I ask what happened to your hand ? I was ... changing the blade on my bowsaw . It 's kind of gross . Yeah . There was a murder out here last week , about 15 , 20 miles off the state road . Did you hear about it ? Yes , I did . - It 's scary . - Yeah . You should wash this out , put iodine on it so it won 't get infected . - You sound like my mother . - I also sound like a doctor . - A medical doctor ? - Yeah . Can you sell me some gas ? I 'd love to , but I 'm all out . The tanker was supposed to be here yesterday but ... I 'm hoping for this afternoon . - How low are you ? - I got a quarter tank , lthink . I 'll make it . - I 'd feel awful bad if you didn 't . Hang on . - Thanks . - Should be enough in here to tide you over . - That 's great . Thank you . Do me a favour . Don 't go tellin ' people that I 'm givin ' away free gas back here . Where is " here " , exactly ? Because I can 't seem to find this town on the map . We 're not really a town . Just a few like-minded people tryin ' to keep the modern world at bay . - You 're good to go . - Thank you very much . Help is coming . ( engine splutters ) OK . Hey ! Excuse me . You put something in my tank that killed my engine . What ? Where 's that gas can ? I 'd like to see it , please . That 's water . I barely even smell any gasoline . Oh , God . You 're right . I 'm sorry . I ... I left it out . It must have gotten rain in it . It rains a lot here , does it ? As it 's basically the desert . - I 'm really sorry . - Yeah . I 'm going to use your phone . I don 't have one . You don 't have a phone . So how did you call up the tanker that was supposed to come here yesterday ? There 's a phone up the street . Mr Milsap 's place . He 'll help you out . Hello ? Hello ? : iﬁé ' : - Mr Milsap ? - Can I help you ? Yes . I hope so . My car 's stalled up the street . I was wondering if I could use your phone . Sure . It 's in here . - The line 's dead . - Oh , no . Let me see . Damn phone company . They 're updating the lines , so the service gets interrupted. lt 'll come back on . - How long ? - Ten minutes . Two hours . I could say , but I 'd just be guessing . You 're welcome to wait here . I could even give you a room , if you like . This was a boarding house . I won 't be here that long . - What the hell is going on here ? - Sorry ? | get the distinct impression that somebody doesn 't want me to leave . - I don 't know anything about that . - A bus came through here about an hour ago . - Where did it go ? - A bus ? Don 't tell me you didn 't see it . I think I 'd have known if a big bus came through . Are you sure I can 't help you out with a room ? It 's 18 miles to the state road . Another 20 to Sugarville . You don 't want to walk it . Excuse me ! Ma 'am , excuse me . Ma 'am . Excuse me , ma 'am . Hello ? Ma 'am , I need some help . Hello ? Hello ? ( sighs ) ( knocking ) ( Milsap ) Doctor , can I speak to you ? It 's ... it 's an emergency . I 'm sorry to bother you . There 's a man downstairs that needs help . Please . Let go . Don 't hold him down . - How long has he been seizing ? - Three ... four minutes . It 's OK . You 're all right . You 're OK . - What 's his name ? - He 's a stranger . He needed help . - What 's wrong with him ? - He had a grand mal seizure . As far as I can tell , he 's in status . It 's a continuous seizure state . He doesn 't smell like acetone , which would indicate that he 's hyperglycaemic . He doesn 't appear to have any head injuries . He could be epileptic and just ceased taking his medication . How did this happen ? Uh-huh . At any rate , we need to get him to a hospital . Immediately . I assume that your phone 's still not working . Sorry . Do you or one of your friendly neighbours happen to have a car ? - No one here has a car . - No cars . We could send someone to the state road on foot . All right ? We could get them to bring back help . In the meantime , please , anything you can do for him . All right . Do you ... Do you have any Karo syrup ? Any corn syrup ? Yeah . ( ringing tone ) Juab County Sheriff 's office . Sheriff Ciolino speaking . Hi . This is Agent John Doggett with the FBI . My partner , Agent Scully , requested some material . What 's your fax number ? Agent Doggett , when 's your partner gonna get here ? The victim 's family wants the body . Agent Scully 's not there ? - She was supposed to be there yesterday . - That was our understanding . Sheriff , could you send a car out ? Agent Scully is in Utah . She called me yesterday somewhere north of Sugarville . - You got it . I 'll get someone right out there . - OK , thanks . I 'll be in touch . Danny , this is John Doggett . I need you to trace a call for me . It came to this office yesterday about 1.30 in the afternoon . Am I doing this right ? Yeah . You can hold off now . - Nothing 's happening . - I 'm sorry but ... I 'm just winging it here . Raising his blood sugar only helps if he has hypoglycaemia . But it could be other things . So what do we do ? I 'm afraid that I have done all that I can do . Unless you know how to get ahold of diazepam or phenobarbital , other than the nearest hospital - which is where we should be , of course . ( coughs ) Hey . Hey . Can you hear me ? How are you feeling ? - OK . - Thank God . Thank God . We were all so scared . - What can I do ? - I think ljust need rest . We should leave him alone . Can you stay ? I 'll go tell everybody . - Are you a doctor ? - Yes , I am . Thank you ... for helping me . I 'm not sure if I 've actually done anything . In fact , I don 't even know ... I don 't even know what 's going on with you right now . Do you know what your name is ? Um ... You don 't remember , do you ? How about how you got here ? What about these people who have taken you in ? Do you know anything about them ? - They take good care of me . - I 'd say they take very good care of you . The sun seems to rise and set on you . In fact , they seem to have stranded me here in order to nurse you back to health . Why would they do that ? A murder took place about 20 miles from here . A man was stoned to death . His head was so badly crushed , they couldn 't identify him from his teeth . It looks like upwards of a dozen people may have participated due to the footprints at the crime scene . But it 's a very tightknit group of people who would murder together . A cult , in a word . And I 'd say that these people qualify . What are you ? A detective ? FBI . And I need to get you out of here , but I don 't know how . Do you think that you can walk ? I don 't know . I 'm kind of weak . I understand . Hang on a second . Let me just look at something , OK ? ( Scully sighs ) ( squishing sound ) ( groans ) That 's starting to hurt . Maybe you shouldn 't do that . Hold on . ( guttural grunting ) ( ringing ) - Doggett . - It 's Ciolino . The number you gave us is a payphone a half-mile from the crime scene . - Agent Scully must 've just come from there . - Looks like . I 'm sorry , still no sign of her . - Are you canvassing neighbours ? - There 's nobody to canvass . It 's a desolate area . There 's nobody out there . Help is coming from our Salt Lake City office . I 'm heading out there , too . - There 's a new angle to look at . - What 's that ? That payphone . Before Scully 's call to me , the last call on it was the night of the murder . It was placed to a Juliette Gulatarski of Fort Collins , Colorado . She tells me it was her brother Hank . He was on his way for a visit . Said he was stuck in the desert but would be there in two days . He never showed . Something 's happening . He 's coming to . Hey . Can you hear me ? How are you feeling ? I 'm alive . That 's a start . - Oh , praise God . - Praise him . Praise him ! What 's wrong with me ? ljust need some rest . She can take care of me . It 's lucky they 're still listening to you for the time being . This wound in your back ? It seems to be a point of entry for a parasitic organism that has taken up residence along your spine . This is something that I am completely unfamiliar with . Oh , boy . I don 't know how far this extends or how to get it out of you without harming you . - Does that mean I 'm dying ? - You will die , if we cannot treat you properly . These people don 't seem to want to let you go . I think that they put this thing inside of you . I have no idea what the motives of these people are - whether it 's some bizarre religious activity . But they killed the last person in your condition , and I 'm afraid that they 're going to try and kill you , too . - This is a lot to take in . - No kidding . - What are you gonna do ? - I 'm gonna try and get us the hell out of here . These people tell me that they have no cars . I don 't believe ' em . They 've got to have transportation hidden around here somewhere . - I 'm gonna take a look around , OK ? - You 're not gonna be gone long , right ? - You know how to use a gun ? - Pretty much . - I 'll be back soon . - The sooner the better . ( knocking ) Where did she go ? She says I 'm dying . We need another swap . - Sheriff ? Agent John Doggett . - You made good time . Agent Brian Mayfield , Salt Lake office . - We 're at your disposal . - Appreciate it . Sheriff , does this wound look familiar ? - It 's the victim in our morgue . - That 's not your murder victim . That 's a photo of a John Doe found off a West Texas highway in . - Our guy has the same wound . - Yeah , I thought you were gonna say that . Arizona , ' 93 . New Mexico , ' 97 . Nevada , ' 99 . All four had their brains beaten out and were dumped in remote areas . All unsolved cases . - How 'd you run these down ? - Agent Scully had me trace this first one . It noted glycoproteins at the crime scene , which is what she found . This same wound kept showing ' up . These murders ranged throughout the Southwest , zigzagging all over the desert . The more remote the better . Hey . How 'd you ... You had me convinced . ( Scully grunts angrily ) I 'm a federal agent ! At this moment , the FBI is searching for me ! They won 't find you . ( Hank ) Doctor . Your life ... is about to take a wonderful turn . You 're going to become a part of something much , much greater than you are . You 're going to be ... so loved . Amen . Amen ! ( group ) Amen . No ! You son of a bitch ! - Amen ! - You just murdered him ! - Amen ! - ( group ) Amen ! No . No ! I 'm pregnant ! No ! No , don 't do this ! I 'm gonna have a baby ! No ! Don 't do this ! No ! I 'm gonna have a baby ! No ! No ! No ! No ! ( Scully crying out with pain ) What did you put in me ? ! I 'm gonna get every last one of you bastards ! No . ( Scully groans ) You 'll love us . You 'll protect us . You 'll teach us , make us better than we are . We 're taught not to envy , but I do envy you so . That you 'll soon be one with him . Him ? ! That thing in my spine is a " him " ? ! ( cries out with pain ) Please . This is such a wonderful , wonderful thing for you ... and your unborn child . That last man just wasn 't a suitable tabernacle . The thing of it is , there 's always the chance that your body won 't fail him , that he 'll be in you for ever . ( vehicle approaching ) Help ! Help ! Help ! ( muffled ) Help ! - Good evening . - Good evening . - You lost ? - Maybe . I 'm way off the main road , for sure . - Can we help you ? - I hope so . I 'm ... looking for this woman . Have you seen her ? No . Can 't say I have . Help ! Help ! She would have been driving a rental car like mine . - You sure she hasn 't been through here ? - No . We get so few visitors , we remember each one pretty well . All right . Thanks for your time . Help ! Help ! ( vehicle leaves ) ( grunts ) - Sheriff , this is Doggett . - I read you , Agent Doggett . Where are you ? 20 miles off the state road , just north of the crime scene . Some kind of outpost . I 'm gettin ' a definite vibe from it . I talked to a guy who had a gun in his pocket - and I don 't mean he was happy to see me . I 'll send everybody I 've got . Hurry . I can 't wait for you . ( moaning ) ( loud groaning ) Hey . ( grunting ) God Almighty . Agent Scully . - Agent Scully . - ( muffled moans ) ( gasps for breath ) Agent Doggett . Get me the hell out of here . - Can you walk ? - I don 't know . - How far is your car ? - It 's about a half-mile up the road . I know something closer . ( Scully cries out ) - Can you hot-wire it ? - Can I hot-wire it ? ! Gone in 60 seconds , Jack . We 're gonna strand these lunatics . - ( groans ) - Agent Scully . - Talk to me . - You gotta cut it out . Cut it out . ( groans ) Now it 's gonna come to my brain . Cut it out of me now ! ( Scully screams with pain ) ( Scully pants ) ( Scully screams ) Just do it , Doggett ! ( pounding on walls ) VVhy ? ( approaching sirens ) - Ready to go ? - Yeah , I 'm ready to go . Grand jury convenes today . All 47 cult members are sticking together . Their defence is that they 're being persecuted for their religious beliefs . They believe they worshipped Christ . That that thing was the Second Coming . Look , I ... Iwanted to apologise . I left you out of this case , and that was a mistake on my part . It was almost a fatal mistake . It was . You screwed up . - And I won 't do it again . - I appreciate it . Visiontext Subtitles : Doreen Trenerry ( child ) I made this !

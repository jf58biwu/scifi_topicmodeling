 ( panting ) ( groans ) Son of a ... ! Crichton . What are you breaking now ? I 'm not breaking anything . I 'm trying to see how our quote-unquote navigation system quote-unquote works . You got a microt ? Ain 't got no time right now , Chi . Crichton , I , uh ... I really got to talk . Chi ! I do not have the time . You don 't have the time ? Okay . Ah ! Son of a ... ( groans ) ( panting ) ( groaning ) ( pulsating ) No . ( pulsating stops ) Nerri . ( yells ) Aeryn : That little tralk ! Aeryn , we don 't know that Chiana stole your Prowler . It 's gone , isn 't it , Crichton ? I did not immediately detect her departure because several of my control systems have been offline . She could be thousands of metras away by now . We found this in the Maintenance Bay . It had Chiana 's blood all over it . What is it ? I believe it 's a Life Disc . Some species have them surgically implanted . This creates a permanent life link between those close to them . Then why would she take it out ? It is no longer functioning . Which means that whoever Chiana was linked to ... is dead . Oh , man . She was trying to talk to me , and I blew her off . ( thundering ) Come on . You 've been in worse places . Who 's there ? ! Stop pleeking around ! Lemme see you ! ( screams ) ( snarling ) Sweet nixar . Let 's mark her . ( Chiana screaming ) My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . So this entire planet 's covered in graves . It 's a Royal Cemetery Planet . Haven 't you ever seen one ? Nope . Chiana ! Well , where did you bury your leaders on Erp ? Just underground . Chiana ! Next to where you lived ? That 's disgusting . Ugh ! Aeryn : Well , the Prowler checked out all right . At least she landed it in one piece . Let 's go . You can take the Transport . No . These belong to Chiana . You coming ? ( moans ) Let 's go . Rygel : What are you talking about ? I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm staying right here . Yeah , like anybody cares . Don 't rob the graves , sparky ! How dare you imply that a Hynerian Dominar would ... dese ... ! ( grunting ) Yotza ! Does this look familiar ? Of course it looks familiar . That 's because each of these tunnels are exactly the same . Are we lost ? ( muffled moans and shrieks ) ( moaning ) What are they doing to her ? I have no idea . Do you see any weapons ? No . I 'll go for Chiana . I 'll pin down the others . Everybody down ! On the ground now ! - Chiana ! Move it ! What are you doing ? ! No one 's ever lasted more than 50 microts in that thing . I had ' em beat . Aeryn : I wouldn 't if I were you . You had no right to come after me . We were worried about you , so we ... - How sweet ! Now get the frell out of here . Chiana . - No , Crichton . Now I don 't have the time . Hey , ancient . Who the hell are you talking to ? And who are you ? Molnon . Taste ? Look at her . Wow . Vyna 's amazed by you . Age lines , dead spots . You 're historic , nixar . Historic ? Molnon : Let 's go , Gardas . They 're worn out . Ancients . Did you catch any of that ? Not much , except all the " l 'm worn out " dren . If you find Chiana , show her this , ask her about it . Ask her yourself . Aeryn . She 's pissed at me . And try not to be too angry about the Prowler . Be nice . I 'm not good at nice . Just don 't shoot her . Okay , Rygel . Take me through this one more time . Why did you leave ? I told you . They left me first . Pilot lost contact with Crichton and Aeryn several arns ago . Where did they go ? Down . Underground . They went looking for Chiana . Crichton seems to think she might still be alive . You frelling Luxan . What is this ? My private property . You robbed the dead . And believe me , that wasn 't as easy as it sounds . Now leave me alone . Yes , that 's right . Get out . Bonus . What do you want ? You forgot this . It 's my brother . Nerri . He 's terminated . It means he 's dead . I 'm sorry . Hey , I got to show you around this place . You know what they do if they want you to stay ? They make you run through these , these , these rings of fire , like , um , naked . Totally naked . And once , once you go through that , you , you go into the Sonic Cowl . That 's where l just was . Your whole body , it vibrates. lt 's ... You got to try it . I think you had a little bit too much to drink . Don 't be like Crichton . Come on . Everyone 's so lame on Moya . Stay with me . You gotta . Or at least stay for the Gathering . And what is that ? Well , Molnon says it 's the dradest . Says it 'll blow my mind . Hey , guy . We didn 't meet before . It 's too late . I don 't know what you 're talking about . The Lost People know ... Hey , hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . Focus , man . Come on . Focus right here . Das . Time to jump , garda . New nari emerges . Clans gather . It 's time to celebrate ! Way back , the ancients dug the Royal Tombs . But the surface is full , and the Royals leave . Now we alone . ( chuckles ) But we live . We take the Stone . ( deep reverberating hum ) ( hum continues ) ( hum stops ) Ahh ! What the ... ? Frell. lt 's a sonic net . You want to explain that ? It 's a net sustained by their own voices . Peacekeepers use them in aerial combat training and the sound actually cushions your fall . I 'm ready . ( deep reverberating hum ) ( hum stops ) Like I said . Frell . Das ... Takes the Stone . Chiana : Drad . I gotta do that . ( thunder roaring ) ( thunder crashing ) Chiana ... Aeryn : Leave her alone , Crichton . Come on . Uh , you know what ? We 're going to sober her up and get her out of here right now . That life disc that we found on board Moya was her brother 's . Then he 's dead ? Yes. I think that 's why she likes it down here . I think she 's trying to prove that she 's still alive . Aeryn , when I need a psych report on Chiana , I 'll let you know . If you try to force her to leave she will stay here just to spite you . No , she won 't . Later . And what are they going to do with it ? Soak the skin and harden the bones . Then Das can be buried in the Gathering Dome . Your best friend 's just died . All die , nixar . But you 're frightened of it . Never knowing when it 's going to happen . Should I do this ? Or do that ? Fear , nixar . It overwhelms . Not us . We live , we do what we want . Liberated , ' cause we take the Stone . A dead jump . The last . I know you get it . Stay with us , nixar . Celebrate the Stone . It 's the second dradesttime . Chiana : Oh ? And what 's the dradest ? ( Zhaan chanting ) Shut up . ( chanting continues ) Shut up ! ( chants louder ) Oh , will you please shut up ! I 'm doing this for your benefit , Rygel . Oh , thank you . Now benefit me elsewhere . I 'm trying to sleep . Have you ever considered that these items might be protected ? Protected ? By what ? A curse . Oh , yotz . The only curse here is you . And , anyway , if there is a curse , which there 's not , it 'll just be on me . Yes , it will . ( groans ) ( whimpers ) Aeryn : Vyna . I 'm sorry about Das . Oh , don 't be , nixar . ( swallowing loud ) Should you be doing that ? Taste ? Hey . What were you talking to Chiana about on the cliff ? When nari comes , Chiana wants to jump . I gave her my blessing . ( chanting ) Chiana , you got a microt ? Not for you . All right , fine . You know what ? You made your point and I 'm sorry that I ignored you on the ship . Okay ? Crichton , why I 'm here , it 's not about you . In case you haven 't noticed , I 'm not your kid . I 'm not your sister and I 'm only your ... your tralkin your dreams . So , please , please , go away ! I 'm trying to help . I don 't want it and I don 't need it . I like it here . I like these people . Chiana , you realize that nobody here has a clue . They 're nothing but stoned monkeys who jump off a cliff ! Then you tell me what we 're doing on Moya that 's so frellingwonderful ? Tell me that . At least they get to live before they die , Crichton . That 's what I want to do . You said to me ... you said to me anytime I want to jump ship , anytime I want to leave . Well ... see ya . Feel free to jump in here anytime . It 's Chiana 's choice , John . Great . That 's just great , Aeryn . You know , I hope if I ever decide to jump in front of a bus you 're not the only one ... Vyna told us you 're joining the clan . You really going to jump ? I might . Molnon ? Yo , Bob Marley , you seen Molnon ? Forget about it . I 'll find him myself . ( sighs in disgust ) Molnon . ( heavy breathing ) No , please , don 't ! ( whimpering ) Wrong person . Sorry , didn 't mean to hurt you . You 've been following me . Why ? You old . But still you live . What 's your name ? Janixx . What happened to you ? This happen to all of us . At 22 cycles , if we do not take the Stone . Gardas and nixars here don 't like seeing this , so we go away . Hide . Make ourself lost . Lost ? You 're one of the Lost People ? Das said he knew why this happened . He said cliff has answer . What are you talking about ? I 'm lost . Must stay lost . Crichton : You must be pushing 22 cycles , huh , sport ? I 'd say the end is near for you , whether you take the Stone or not . You 've been talking to the Lost People . ( chuckles ) You true smart . Yeah , well , it 's easy to jump when you know you 're going to die . Chiana 's not going to die . Why drag her into this ? See this ? Three lobes gets you high . One gets you dead . Never know which one . Are we having a failure to communicate here ? I 'm not going to talk until you taste . Ooh , man . ( soft chuckles ) Now since you taste , I talk . Only thing worth having is a nari , and I want one . And I 'm scared that if next I take the Stone , it claims me . So Chiana takes my place . She takes the Stone . Son of a bitch ! You 've had your time . You leave Chiana out of this , just ... She wants to fly . I tell you truth . And I 'm going to tell her ... truth . ( slowly ) : Truth . ( blurred speech ) : Only if you remember . You won 't remember . I 'm going to remember . ( laughing ) ( three stooges laugh ) ( screaming ) Aeryn : Crichton ! Crichton ... Whoa ! Here ... What happened to you ? I had a pissing contest with Molnon . I won. I think . It doesn 't look like it . Yeah . Yeah , well ... I got some information . There 's more ... ( both grunting ) I , uh ... I , uh ... I think I convinced him to get Chiana not to jump . Aeryn : That 's good . That 's great . Crichton : Listen ... I need you to go back to the Transport pod . Take this tissue sample . I got it from the Lost People . Scan it up to Zhaan . See if we can find out what ... what 's killing these kids . Where are you going ? To see if this ... ( groaning ) Excedrin headache was worth it . Crichton ! Whoa , whoa ... not so ... so loud . Those morna , they have a real kick to them , don 't they ? Mmm ... Hey , um ... Molnon told me what you talked about . He did ? That 's fantastic . That is fanta ... let us get the hell out of here then . Oh , no , I 'm not leaving . I 'm jumping . What ? Come on , don 't frell with me . You understand . Chiana , I know that you like Molnon . But he is using you . He only wants you here so you 'll do the jump and he won 't have to . No , he 's not . I want to jump . I have to . Okay . Okay . - Okay . You want to jump ? Yeah . But whatever you want , you cannot want to die . Well , maybe one day ... you 'll understand . ( gasping ) You frelling .. . you frelling khan . You gotta to let me ... you gotta to let me fly . You gotta to let me fly . Aeryn : What ... what are you doing ? I think it 's pretty self-explanatory . You 're not going anywhere . Yes , I am . No , you 're not . - She wants to jump . She wants to kill herself . You can 't take her like this . Yes , I can ! - No , you can 't ! I c ... Aeryn ! What the hell is wrong with you ? You are the pin-up girl for frontal assault . You should be dragging her back to the ship yourself . Crichton , just listen to me , will you ? If Chiana really wants to , she 's going to find a way to kill herself , and maybe not here , or now . So you have to let her work through this on her own . You cannot take her back to Moya like this . When did you get so insightful ? I understand loss . So do I . Did you scan the tissue samples up to Zhaan ? Aeryn : Yes , I did . Thank you . Well , let 's get her on the dog and bone . Whatever that means , Crichton . Rygel : Now this is what a Dominar 's chamber should look like . Hung with the blood-stained trophies from my conquests . ( Rygel screaming ) This cannot be real . Yes , I know what 's happening . Talk to me , Zhaan . What have you got ? John , the readings from the tissue samples do indicate long-term radiation exposure . Yeah , I thought they might . But according to your readings , the radiation level is only 76 trads . is that high or low ? Low , I would have thought . Huh. ls that too low to make somebody sick ? D 'Argo : Yes . But Pilot thinks that the cliff chamber you 're describing may be acting as an amplifier which would increase the exposure . Aeryn : I imagine that would be the reason why they all die at twenty two cycles . I believe it would . Crichton : Maybe Das figured that out . You know , maybe he knew if the clans moved out of the caves , they 'd stop dying so young . They wouldn 't have a reason to take the Stone . Thanks , guys . We 'll all be back up real soon . Goddess be with you , John . Curse my mivonks . I know what you 're up to and it 's not going to work . What are you talking about ? Rygel : It 's you that 's making everything in my chamber cursed . But I 'm not returning any of it , no matter what you do . I 'm keeping it all , you hear me ? Everything ! ( Vyna screaming ) Do you need help ? Can I get someone for you ? Vyna : No , don 't touch me ! We give birth alone , as our clans prepare the Gathering . Yes , and somebody has to do the bungee without the rope , except this time it 's our friend jumping . Ah , it 's too late , garda ! Now go ! ( screaming ) Leave ! Listen , Vyna , we know why you all die young here . Crichton : It 's radiation . We think that Das knew it , too . He knew there was a way to stop the jumps . Das ? Oh , my poor Das . Aeryn : Vyna , if you move out of these caves and up to the surface , you can all live longer lives . Your child can , too . Crichton : We need you to talk to the clans . If they hear it from you , they 'll believe it . No one ever has to jump again . ( screaming ) Molnon didn 't make Das jump , garda . The rules of the clan did . Das understood . In the final , Das scoped that truth . You let him die ? Vyna : No ! He took the Stone ! He 'll live forever now . ( screaming ) Look at you . You 're old . You 're worn out ! Now , go ! Aaghh , just go ! ( Vyna continues screaming ) ( sobbing ) Chiana , don 't . Listen to me , all of you . There 's radiation in the rocks . That 's what 's killing the Lost People . That 's what 's killing all of you . ( chuckles ) Garda doesn 't understand . He 's old ! Crichton : That 's right . I 'm old . And you can be old just like me . ( Molnon chuckles ) I don 't want to be ancient , garda . Move to the surface . Live as long as you can . The surface belongs to the Royals and their tombs . ( hisses ) You think that Janixx has it bad ? Wait till you see what this does to your face . Crichton , get the frell out of here ! This is about me . Chiana , shut up and don 't move another step ! Ready , boy ? There 's your Stone . What do you say ? Want to take it together ? Tick , tick , tick . Time 's running out . Garda doesn 't understand . We want the Stone . ( hisses ) ( all hiss ) Oh , you think ? Let the clans decide . Let the clans vote ! Molnon : Clans will vote . ( Molnon chuckles ) What they scope , I 'll follow . You satisfied ? Chiana , I 'm just trying ... You can 't help me . Rygel : They 're just trying to scare me . Get me to cut them in . Well , they can forget about that . It 's not going to work . ( metallic clank ) Who 's there ? ( chuckles nervously ) Yotz ! There 's nothing wrong with any of this . Nothing ! You hear that ? I am Rygel the Sixteenth . You can 't scare me ! ( gasps ) All right . All right , I 'll take it back . All of it. I promise . Just make it stop . ( screams ) Pilot , is the Transport fueled ? Crichton : Yo , Molnon . How 'd the vote go ? You got no idea , garda . No idea . All the clans , every one , voted to stay . To keep jumping . What ? They didn 't believe the radiation was killing them ? No , they don 't believe . They know what 's killing them . I 'm rechanting the Gathering . They want the Stone . I 've already told Chiana . I 've given her a head start . It 's going to be drad . Hey , Molnon . Please , just wait . Just ... Why does it always end in tears ? ( thunder crashes ) Hey , old man . Chiana ... - Don 't come any closer . I won 't . Have the clans voted ? Yeah . And they 're going to stop jumping ? No . They voted to keep jumping . They want to die . I just can 't believe that you want to die . Never had any courage . As a kid , Nerri gave me everything . I just ... I just followed him . You 've shown me courage plenty of times . I got to see if I can do this , Crichton . And if you die ? ( humming single note ) ( humming ceases ) Chiana ! You did it ! Woo-hoo-hoo ! I did it ? Woo ! ( both laughing ) I did it ! ( thunder crashing ) lt 's been three arns , John . Just give it a few more microts , okay ? Lately ... do I seem ... a little crazy to you ? What do you mean , " lately " ? Well , I ate one of Molnon 's mushrooms . One in four gets you dead . Was that supposed to get Chiana out of here more quickly , John ? You eating a mushroom ? ( loud grunt ) ( metallic clattering ) Rygel , we 're out of here in 90 microts with or without you . I 'm going as fast as I can . Hey , old man . Hey , little girl . You okay ? Yeah . You know ... Molnon was right about one thing . The jump was incredible . You should have tried it . Nah , I 'm too old . It 's time to go . Chiana : Let 's get out of this dead place . ( hisses ) ( hisses )

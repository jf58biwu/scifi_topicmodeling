 Well is it them or isn 't it ? Moya can 't be certain until she 's closer . Which one ? Green or black ? - This is not the time . D 'Argo , green or black ? Well , the black , of course . I mean , far be it for me to say but I 've always thought that the cut of that green shirt doesn 't suit the shape of your body . You know , it 's gotta be them . We are near the rendezvous point . If it is them , why are they on a Transport Pod ? And where 's Talyn ? Oh hoo ! Crichton is not going to like having the other Crichton around again . Yeah , he 'll like having Aeryn around , though . You want me to wear this when they come aboard ? Yeah ! You look blexk ! In this ? - Yeah . I don 't think so . The Transport Pod has turned and is heading our way . You made contact yet ? Yes , but they 're not responding . You know what , perhaps they can 't respond . In the last message we received , all they said is that they 'd defeated a Retrieval Squad . We don 't know at what cost . D 'Argo , if Talyn is a casualty , then ... John , I 'm sure everyone 's all right . Rendezvous in 600 microts . Pilot , there could be casualties . Have them land near the med area , and get Jool and Chiana down here fast ! She 's going to be walking off that Pod , I know it . Chiana 's right . Aeryn 's fine . I 'm sure the other you has taken extra good care of her . I mean , all I meant was that I 'm sure that he did everything that you would have done if you had been with Aeryn all this time . Don 't move ! Please . Don 't move . I doubt that we could . Identify yourself . Our calling card . A Peacekeeper tralk . We have just escaped from imprisonment . Can you help us ? My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . You were traveling through the Uncharted Territories in a Transport Pod ? A Pod that was meant as a target for the weapons testing of a new Peacekeeper deep space device . Ah , you have more Janeray syrup ? She is like Rygel . What were you doing in a Pod meant for weapons testing ? We were part of the test . They wanted to see how different species would react to fire from their new weapon . How we would die . The Peacekeeper Tech was doing a last microt check of the Pod . We were able to overpower him . I was able over to overpower him . And blast ourselves out of there . Ah-ah-ah-ah . Not too close . He 's a Scarran . If you are concerned because of my heat protection , first thing Peacekeepers do with Scarran prisoners . By removing the gland , it protects them and weakens me . Frell . This Pod is coming apart at the seams . The weapon the Peacekeepers were testing destroys the bonding of metallic molecules . That 's why this Pod is so damaged . What exactly are we looking for ? A Boolite . And what does he look like ? Big , small , hairy , blue , green ? He doesn 't ... look like he used to . You see , Boolites have a much , much higher metal content than other species , so when the weapon hit our Pod , it ... Excuse me . What the hell is this ? That 's the Boolite , or at least part of him . Okay . Boolite body parts can survive independent of the main body for as much as half a cycle . Right . And he 's still alive ? You have to try to save him . Help put him back together . Right . Why aren 't they at the rendezvous point ? If I have to spend two more microts on this midget ship , I 'm going to vomit ! Talyn has found Moya at the extreme range of his senses . Oh ! Was it too much to ask that they be where they said they 'd be ? Talyn , set intercept course . He 's coming ! He 's coming ! It 's Talyn . He 's on an intercept course . What ? Why don 't you go and welcome them back . I 'll make sure our guests don 't get into any trouble . Thanks , man . Sparky ! How you doin ' , man ? Long time , no see . Yes . Uh ... good to see you , too . But if anything is missing from my quarters , blood is going to spill . Whatever . Crais . Well , there 's a familiar face . Hello , John . What 's wrong ? The , uh ... other ... Crichton , he 's dead . Oh ... You , uh , have visitors on Moya ? Yeah , there 's , um ... Oh , a female ! Oh ... It is . A female . Oh , please rise . You recognize me ? Who could forget the royal profile ? You 're alive . Indeed . And you are ? Orhnn Pak . From the Jensii province . Oh ... At least , I was . And you have been a Peacekeeper prisoner ? Arrested because I refused allegiance to Dominar Bishan . Oh , that 's no crime . It 's an act of courage . Oh , I shouldn 't have been speaking of myself , of my travails , when I am in your presence . Forgive me , Your Highness . Forgive me . Now , it is permissible for you to be the focus of attention , if I desire it . Oh ? And I , uh ... I ... I do so desire it . I 'm not well schooled in the arts . It just needs to give us some idea of what the Boolite looks like . Stand there . As you instruct . And don 't even think about moving . Chiana . Have you seen Aeryn and the others ? Only for a moment . Not quite the reunion we were expecting . The other Crichton dead and ... and Stark searching for Zhaan 's spirit . Well , with a single Crichton and Stark missing , perhaps it will restore some sanity to the ship . Stand back ! What ? A pulse blast . Didn 't you hear it ? No . It was here ! Okay . Okay . It 's happening again . I 'm frelling sensing stuff before it happens . So much for sanity . Move ! D 'Argo , I heard a pulse blast . - Move ! Frell ! Hey ! Hey , come on , you can 't leave me in here ! You 're a Peacekeeper ? They beat me , they took me hostage . You 're a fugitive . I 'm a member of the Peacekeepers , and if you help me out of here there 'll be a big , big reward . What , 200 darcats for a tech ? Those are escaped prisoners you have on your ship . They 're dangerous . Don 't you care ? No , not anymore . If this image has appeared , it means my mask has reached its destination , and you have made contact with it . I have a message for you Crichton . For you alone . Listen . Listen . - Crichton , there 's a message ... - Crichton , Moya has detected a signal . Lousy timing , Pilot . Really lousy timing . What kind of signal ? A Peacekeeper distress signal . How close is it ? Crichton , you don 't understand . The signal was sent from here . Somebody aboard Moya just broadcast a distress call to the Peacekeepers . Pilot , can you isolate the source of the signal ? It appears to have come from Tier Seven or Eight . I have DRD 's searching there now . Has anyone answered it yet ? We 're not going to give them time . Moya will initiate Starburst in 100 microts . What about Talyn ? Crais has ordered him to Starburst alone on a similar vector . Talyn will make contact as soon as he can locate us . Why would anybody here want to signal the Peacekeepers ? What about the Tech ? He was a Peacekeeper . No , no , no , the Tech is kept in a cell on Tier Eleven . I put my currency on the Scarran . Well , normally , I 'd agree with you , but Naj Gil 's been with me the whole time . What about the Nebari ? Hubero has never left my sight . And , uh , since she arrived , sweet Orhnn has been atop me or , uh ... beneath me , or ... Okay , there 's a mental Polaroid we can all live without , Ryge . Okay , plan . We 've gotta double time prep on the Pod . We 've gotta get them out of here of here as soon as we can . And until we do we should lock 'em all up for safekeeping . Agreed ? No , John , I will not imprison Naj Gil . He hasn 't done anything wrong . He 's going to stay with me . And Hubero never leaves my sight , just like before . And Orhnn and I will just be , uh ... Be making the Hynerian with two backs , trunks , whatever . Yeah , just remember one of them sent the signal . Be careful . Be careful . Starbursting now . According to Hubero 's rendering of the Boolite , this obviously goes here . Wrong . It 's clearly vascular , not skeletal . Put this piece there , attach that piece to there , then there . Yes , well that would seem to be correct . I was hoping that once we got enough of him together that he would be able to tell us how to do the rest . That 's why I 'm starting on the head and the mouth first . Head and mouth ? What , you don 't think that that 's the head and that 's the mouth ? Well , not unless he sits on his mouth . Mag-stet . Turbo-sealer . Fluffy pink slippers . Donald Duck . Mickey Mouse . Huey , Louie and Dewey . You wanna talk ? Okay , fine . No talking . No , you know what ? I wanna talk . I had words with Crais and , um , he told me that you and the other me ... Actually , he didn 't ... tell me anything . He , um ... told me to talk to you . So I assume ... Aeryn , I 'm sorry . I ... Maybe you 're right . Maybe we shouldn 't talk . Want some advice ? Nope . What ? Oh , my friend , I ... I don 't know what to say . I don 't have any advice . It 's difficult , isn 't it ? You 're jealous of the other you , aren 't you ? He died . The other guy . The copy . Now Aeryn thinks that you are the copy . Hey , man . How you doin ' ? Crichton . Shh , shh , shh . What do you want ? Their Transport Pod is stocked and it 's almost repaired . Is Barbarella ready to vamoose ? I 'm not sure I want her to go . In fact , I 'm sure I don 't . Rygel , look , I completely understand . But you cannot let the little appendage start telling the big appendage what to do . John , I think I 'm in love with her . And I think she loves me . Well , that may be the best reason of all to get her out of here as quick as you can . You still got half an arn . I ... I heard what you said . I didn 't mean ... I liked it , Rygie . Are you ready to go again , hmm ? Again ? We have half an arn . I 've heard Dominars never need rest . Rrrr ... Growl like a blegzoon . So what 'd you do ? Why 'd they imprison you ? Actually , when the Peacekeepers found me , they tried to give me back . But Nebari Prime didn 't want me . To them , I 'm just another mouth to feed in a non-conformist colony . Non-conformist ? What ? Why ? What ? You 're an ... an ... an ... an androgen . Not exactly male , not exactly female . Not exactly anything . When ... when I was growing up , I ... I was told about androgens and , I ... but I , uh ... but they were always taken right after birth . I ... I never met one . At least you didn 't think you ever did . What 's happening ? He 's talking . Listen , listen ... Traitor ... traitor ... He keeps repeating the same word over and over . Traitor . I bet he still thinks he 's on the Transport Pod . So the traitor ... Was on the Pod . Can he hear us ? Yes . Wow . There 's an ear in here somewhere . Okay , this is a little too Naked Lunch . Can you tell us who the traitor is ? I ... I don 't remember ... I 've used all the brain matter we 've found so far . It 's possible the part of his memory that holds the answer isn 't here . Either that , or we 're tracking it all over the ship with our shoes . Shots fired ! Shots fired ! - Shots where ? Pilot , it 's D 'Argo . I 'm in the Center Chamber ! Naj Gil has been shot ! What happened ? We were in the Center Chamber . He heard a noise and came out . There was a pulse blast ... - Direction ? I don 't know . By the I came out , it was all gone . Can you get me something to stop the bleeding ? I knew it . I knew it . I got him . I knew ... I knew someone was gonna get shot . Pip , that is no help to us right now . If you can tell us who did it , that might be useful . Perhaps you know ! No ! I have no idea ! Well , think hard . Leave her alone ! What 's all the noise about ? Where 've you been ? Let go of her , you lunatic Luxan . She 's never left my side . D 'Argo , that 's not helping , man . One of them has to have done it . Not Hubero . She 's been with me the whole time . And I 've been with Orhnn . Release her now . D 'Argo ! Get us away from this welnitz . I agree . There 's too much dren in this room . Come on . Chiana ... There 's been another signal . What ? ! DRDs are trying to find the source . Pilot , Starburst . Moya can 't , not for another arn . And this signal , it sent out Moya 's coordinates . Who the hell is doing this ? This is the signaling device . DRDs found it attached to a neural cluster on Tier Eight . Can you tell whose it is ? It 's constructed of parts easily found in Moya , but it required an impressive technical knowledge to assemble . Anything ? It hasn 't moved . Nor have I , if that 's what you 're wondering . Pilot , can you confirm that ? The DRD has sensed no movement . Is something wrong ? Pilot , how long before their Transport Pod is repaired ? The DRDs will finish within a half arn . a quarter arn . We 'll have you off this boat as soon as we can . Rygel , Chiana , listen up . Unless we got a Tech who can walk through walls or hypnotize DRDs , the bad guy 's got to be with one of you . Now , we are not going to hurt anybody , but their transport is almost fixed , so we 'll load ' em with supplies and send them to a very friendly Commerce Planet . Everybody goes their own way . Okay ? Pip ? Sparky ? Okay ? Damn it ! The others can leave . You 'll stay . And then ? And then , Orhnn , dear Orhnn ... there are many things we must talk about . Do we have to talk about them now ? Mmm ... oh ! Again . Here . I 've managed to stop the bleeding , but I know even less about Scarrans than I do Boolites . I mean , I thought these guys were virtually impenetrable . Yeah , but the skin hadn 't fully healed from the removal of the heat gland . Whoever shot him knew exactly where to aim . Pilot , any sign of Rygel or Chiana ? Nothing . They are still not responding to their Comms . Aeryn . What ? Crichton , he , uh ... D 'Argo ... don 't . When they finally find us they 'll be angry at you for hiding me . They get angry at me a lot . Do you trust Crichton ? Would he really allow us to leave on a Transport Pod ? Yeah , I trust him . But you really want to leave ? Chiana , I don 't want to cause you any trouble . I 'll wait in the Transport Pod until it 's fixed . W - Wait-wait , wh-whoever shot you will be in the Pod . What are you talking about ? I haven 't been shot . I - I ... I mean Naj Gil . Whoever shot ... Hubero ! Hubero , wait ! Traitor ... What 's he saying ? Beauty ... So ... so beautiful ... More pulse fire ! The DRD watching the Peacekeeper Tech has gone dead , and the cell door 's open . On my way , Pilot ! Get the DRDs searching . She ... betrayed ... us . " She " ? On Pod ... I caught her making a deal with Tech . The name of the traitor ? Name ? Wake up ! Wake up now ! We really need you to move your ass now ! Huh ? I 'm afraid I must insist . Rygel , Chiana , it 's Orhnn . She sent the signals ! I got you , Crichton . Hubero and I are heading to the Maintenance Bay . - Keep your eyes out . - Orhnn must have shot Naj Gil . And let the Tech loose . Rygel , are you hearing this ? Move ! Rygel ! Why , Orhnn ? Why ? You were a prisoner of the Peacekeepers like the rest of us . Because , my dear gullible Dominar , the odds of staying free stunk . So , I struck a deal with the Tech . B - B-But when you were on Moya , you were free . For how long ? I don 't want to spend my life running from the Peacekeepers . And once I got here , I found a you . They 'll be far more interested in recapturing a full royal than a lowly soldier like myself . You 're a soldier ? You might not have deigned to take pleasure with me if you 'd known I was a common soldier . And I needed you to take pleasure so you would fall asleep and I could roam the ship . It was unfortunate that the Scarran saw me . But you slept , too . All Hynerians sleep deeply after ... pleasure . The " pleasure , " Dominar , was all yours . You were ... faking ? Oh , males . Move it ! You seen Aeryn ? One tier down . The DRD 's are searching all the other tiers . What the hell was that ? Somebody has neutralized Moya 's calorics . We 're unable to move . They 're going to make a run for it and they got Rygel . Rygel could be going voluntarily . - And maybe he 's not . You 're not really going to leave the Boolite here like this , are you ? Under the circumstances , he can wait . I 'm going to assist in the search . Uh , uh ... For me ? Get down ! Orhnn ! Help ! Orhnn , Let 's do it ! Help ! Orhnn ! Don 't throw that ! No ! Shut up ! Shut up , Dominar ! Shut up ! Whoa , Chiana , don 't shoot ! It 's me ! Down ! Hubero , down ! Oh ! Crais ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Crais ! Crais ! Help ! Ah , prong-prong ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Crichton ! Crichton ! They 've got Rygel ! Pilot , close the outer hanger doors ! I can 't . Moya 's connection has been severed . I 've got an idea . - I 've got an idea . Begin broadcasting our location to the Peacekeepers . We had the same idea . No , I wanted to take your module . You didn 't know D 'Argo could fly this . Frelling dren ! There 's a ship gaining on us . Any word from Talyn ? Negative . He still hasn 't caught up with us yet . Okay , we 're going in . They won 't shoot us down with him aboard . I wouldn 't be so sure about that . Opening rear hatch . They 're right above us . What 's their plan ? Oh , they 're going to kill you , bitch . - Right , D 'Argo . - Your position is good . I will fire close to the hatch . Put this on . Keep it steady , D 'Argo . I 'm trying . Steady . This cable gonna hold ? It 's irradium alloy ; of course it 'll hold . Just like the budong . Budong ? What are you talking about ? - You ... Just follow my lead . Go now , Aeryn ! Go ! Oh , this 'll be fun . They 're on the hull ! Yeah ? Yeah . Coming in ! Shoot them ! Stay down ! Rygel ! I got you , Sparky ! Help me , Rygie ! Aeryn , I got him ! Good . Hey , Rygie ... what ... what is ... going ... on ? ! Hey , Buckwheat . How you doin ' ? I will not be taken to task for having a trusting nature . Rygie ! Ah , women . Talyn 's back . He 's found us . Tell Talyn to steer clear . The Tech hit the cell drive . This Pod is gonna blow . We 've gotta go , now . Now , D 'Argo ! It 's all in my head , which means it 's in yours , too . Wormholes , A to Z. You 've probably already heard what we did with it , and that 's just the beginning . You could fry a whole solar system . Heh . Furlow is still out there , somewhere , but for right now , the Scarrans are back to square one . Peacekeepers . They 're your problem . Look at me . Now look at yourself . You know . Don 't let Scorpius crack this . Whatever it takes . Okay . I 'm gonna piss you off now , man . Be smart . Don 't push her . She takes ... time . Oh , one more thing . Good luck , John . So that 's what I 'm doing . You don 't have to come along . You don 't have to like it . I just want you to know . Moya and I are against this idea in totality . I 'm sure Captain Crais is aware that Talyn resists also . You don 't know how far Scorpius is in his wormhole research . You don 't know where he keeps it . You don 't know anything . How you going to stop him ? I 'll pass , if you don 't mind . Why are you wearing an eyepatch ? Boolite in my eye . Why are you such a moron ? Guys . I don 't see another option . Scorpius has the knowledge from my brain and I 'm not gonna let him shaft the universe with it . You 're all gonna die . You see that one , Pip , or you just guessing ? We choose our own path . This one is mine . I 'm going to the Command Carrier . I 'm going to stop Scorpius .

 It 's time to wake up and get a life . We live in a three-dimensional world . Until now , the world of computing has been a flat world consisting of two-dimensional imagery . Now , through the use of exclusive , breakthrough technology , ARC has made it possible for you to get a life . A-Life , where we can work and play in a lifelike world of three-dimensional reality . A-Life , the living monitor . Impressed ? Yeah , I am . Would you put one of those in a box for me ? - Are you the lawyer ? - I 'm Rita Dunne . Obviously , no one from Nexim could be here today . - I 'd invite you in , but ... - Good luck , Mr Jennings . - I 'll see you in two months . - Yeah . Home , sweet home . What do you think ? This is the exact same technology ? Not the exact same technology , no . Ultimately , I decided to reconceive some of it . I never liked the way the monitor looked . And then it occurred to me , who needs it ? Gentlemen , I am the future of computing . And I would like to present you with Nexim 's new Freedom line of display technology . New from Nexim . Freedom is in your future . Launch this now . ARC is not gonna last . Who said 100 % market share was impossible ? Get me Marketing immediately . This far exceeds our expectations . Congratulations . Well , thank you . You understand , Mr Jennings , you 've just done in two months what we 've been trying to do for three years . Sometimes it 's easier if you work backwards . Cheers . You won 't remember me , will you ? No . That 's too bad . Marker reached . Okay . We 're now extracting his memory from the marker forward to the present . Jesus , Rita . Jesus Christ ! This is dangerous enough . If this man 's brain temp goes one C above 43 , he 's a veg . Come on , Mike . Here we go . It 's all clean . Good morning , sunshine . Hey , how you doing , big guy ? - Okay ? - Yeah . All right . Thank you . Take it easy . Slow , slow , slow . There 's no hurry , okay ? - That 's it . Good ? - Yeah . Good man . Hey , Mike , look at me . Look at me . Right here . What 's the last date you remember ? - October 19 . - Very good . Mike , what 's the last thing you remember ? The Red Sox made the playoffs . Okay . Let 's get the legal out of the way , shall we ? Okay . Mr Michael Jennings , under the terms of your non-disclosure agreement , you are considered never to have been an employee . You also understand that all your work is the intellectual property of Nexim ... Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I never worked here . I never saw anybody . I never was here . I got it . Is my paycheque ready ? All righty . - How you feeling , tiger ? - Good . - Now let 's hear you . - All right . - Ready ? - Yeah . Go ! In order to zero the full eight weeks , I had to heat your brain to 42.5 C. - I 'm fine . - I 'm saying it 's getting harder , Mike . I said I 'm fine . You 're slowing down , actually . Come on . I 'd be a lot faster if you 'd shut up . Show me what you 've got , grasshopper . That 's it . That 's more like it ! Yes ! Go , go , go ! Go ! Go ! Yes ! Faster ! Beautiful ! Yes ! One more ! One more , Mikey ! Now , do you see how you did that ? How you focused ? - Yeah . I focused on your face . - Now , you know you love me . Come on . Come on . Don 't be mean to the one who does everything for you . Do you realise you 've never once asked me what I see when I erase your memory ? Basically , the last two months just never happened for you . What 's to know ? Twenty hours a day in a clean room ripping off one guy 's idea for a computer , selling it to somebody else ... You know . What 'd you do the last two months ? You know what the last thing I remember is ? Driving in Spain in the Aston Martin , learning to dive in Belize with what 's-her-name . The seven-stadiums-in-seven-days trip . It 's great . I mean , my memories are basically highlights . It 's good . It 's a good life . The stuff you erase , it doesn 't matter . What is it with guys like Rethrick ? He 's gotta have everything , huh ? Well , say what you want about Jimmy , he started Allcom in his garage . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Don 't you leave me alone . What ? You 'll be fine . Talk . Mingle . I don 't want to mingle . Hello . I 'm Michael . I 'm Rachel . Rachel Porter . Is that Miss or Mrs ? That would be Dr. Porter . Doctor . Well , excuse me , Doctor . It 's all right . What kind of a doctor are you ? - I 'm a biologist . - Really ? Do you work for Jimmy ? So it must be very top-secret biology that you practise . Oh , yes . Isn 't everything ? Let 's go . Excuse me ? I mean , I 'm happy to continue blathering on , trying helplessly to charm you , but I thought maybe , you know , cut to the chase and just , you know , go somewhere . I 'll tell you what , Michael . I 'm gonna walk over there and talk to a friend of mine . If you get the urge to have a real conversation , you 'll know where to find me . Okay . Fair enough . It was nice to meet you . Giving up so easily ? You don 't believe in second chances , now , do you ? In my experience , no , I don 't . - Good night . - Good night . - Mike . - Jimmy . - How you doing ? - Good . How you doing ? - Good to see you . - You , too . You look good . - Thanks for coming . - Thanks for having me . - Come back this way . - Sure . Hey , Jimmy . Now you 're talking . Thank you . Wait a second . Isaac , disable fire protection , please . Alarm disabled . I don 't think you 'd look so good covered in foam . Even in that spiffy suit . What 's the pitch , Jimmy ? I 've known you long enough to know when you 're trying to sell me something . What is it ? You know , there was a time we were in school , we wanted to change the world . I thought we said we wanted to save the world . Well , that 's semantics . - What 's the job , Jimmy ? - Can 't tell you , other than to say that it involves optics . And you get stock options for this one , Mike . Get a real piece of the company . What if it doesn 't work ? I get a real piece of nothing . I promise you , it won 't fail . How do you know that ? Is this a real crystal ball ? I wish . The point is , I 'll guarantee that you do eight figures . - Minimum . - What 's the catch ? The job may require a little bit more time than you 're used to . - How much more time ? - Two years , maybe three . - You 're kidding . - Deadly serious . Jimmy , it 's impossible . You can 't do it . The longest anyone has ever done is eight weeks . I know , ' cause it was me . Assuming it were possible , would you do it ? - Give up three years of my life ? - Not give up , trade . Three years in return for the rest of your life . One big paycheque . You 're done . A lot can happen in three years . You blink , it 'll be over . To you , it 'll be two seconds . A heartbeat , then snap , you 're rich beyond your wildest dreams . One big paycheque . You 're done . Mr Jennings . John Wolfe . Welcome . You understand that you won 't be allowed to leave the grounds . You 'll be assigned a residence right here on campus . All your mail will be screened , no outside phone calls . Anything you do receive will have to be inspected . Okay . I 'm gonna need all your personal belongings . Watch , wallet , anything else you 're carrying . I 'm afraid nothing 's allowed to be brought in . All these items will be returned to you when you pick up your paycheque . Sorry . Those , too . - Mike , hey , you made it . - Yeah . - Good to see you . - Good to see you , too . - Everything okay ? - Yep . Sit down . I assume Mr Wolfe gave you all the fine print . Yeah . He also took the last pair of sunglasses I 've managed not to lose . I 'm sorry . What is this ? It 's for your memory wipe . We inject you with an isotope , migrates to your brain , lodges , serves as a marker . Then when we 're done , another injection erases everything back to the marker . No barbaric cooking of the brain . All right . Wow . - What have I gotten myself into ? - Let 's go find out . Initiating Blue Script directory . Impressive . This used to be our smallest unit . Now it 's our most profitable . Excuse me , Mr Rethrick , may I speak with you for a moment ? - Have a look around . I 'll be right back . - Okay . Cycle complete . Begin transmission of data . All right ! I give up ! I give up . Don 't give up . Dr Porter . I guess I 'm lucky you didn 't use thunder and lightning . True . Okay , well , I won 't question your powers in the future . Sorry , I just couldn 't help myself . I thought you said Marianne was on a plane today . She was planning to make the conference call from the plane , sir . Look , I should probably apologise for my behaviour the other day . I get like that sometimes , and I shouldn 't . I 'm sorry . Careful . You are in danger of sounding like you want a second chance . - Everything okay ? - Yeah . - Say something else . - Excuse me ? Say something nice . Quick , otherwise I 'll forget it . Was that little breeze for our boy here ? Well , I owed him one . Now we 're even . Well , be nice ' cause Mike 's moving into the neighbourhood . - See you around . - Okay . - You ready ? - Yeah . Let 's go . You know , you can still back out . No hard feelings . No , I want to stay . Michael Jennings , meet the other half of your team , Dr William Dekker . - Nice to meet you . - It 's a pleasure . Gentlemen . Let 's have a look at the next three years of your lives . What happened ? Michael . You 're done . - How long was it , Jimmy ? - It 's been three years , Mike . - How 'd I do ? - You did good . Your money 's been transferred to your account at Reddy Grant Associates . You 've got an appointment there today at 1 : 00 . Just go home , do the paperwork . When you feel up to it , give me a call . We 've got a lot of catching up to do , Mike . $ 92 million . Everyone at Reddy Grant Associates appreciates your business , sir . Well , not as much as I appreciate my business , I promise you . Okay . Just sign there . - All right . - Great . - Your personal items . - Yes . You only needed four stamps . Oh , well , guess I could afford the extra 50 cents . I don 't think this is my stuff . - It 's not ? - No . - I don 't know what happened . - It 's all right . Don 't worry about it . It doesn 't matter . Let 's talk about my shares . What I 'd like to do is get some money now , and , you know , put the rest away for long term , to live off . So how do we do that ? Mr Jennings , you forfeited your shares . I beg your pardon ? What ? Yeah , here . Dated four weeks ago . You surrendered the shares and stated to deliver only the envelope of personals . - Don 't you remember doing that , sir ? - No . I don 't remember that because I didn 't do that . Why would I do that ? I wouldn 't do that . It doesn 't make sense . A mistake has been made , and it needs to be corrected . Well , I agree . It 's a strange thing you did ... It 's not strange . Strange is a little out of the ordinary , but still plausible . Giving away $ 100 million in shares in a Fortune 500 company for some knickknacks isn 't strange , it 's insane . No one would do that . This doesn 't make sense . Unless you think this is a $ 40-million can of hair spray , which is pink . What , this is a $ 100-million book of matches ? I 've been a little out of it for a couple of years . I don 't know , is this back in style now ? Are these $ 100-million sunglasses ? Am I missing something here ? Okay , I 'll look into it , but it 's gonna take me some time . This is crazy . I 'm gonna make some phone calls . Okay . Mr Rethrick 's office . Hi , it 's Michael Jennings . Tell him it 's important , please . I 'm sorry , but he stepped away . He won 't be back until later this afternoon . I can try him on his cell phone if you 'd like . Just have him call me as soon as he gets in . Okay ? - Okay . - Thank you . Listen , guys , a mistake has been made here . All right ? - I 'm not a traitor . I 'm an engineer . - A reverse engineer , right ? We already know that you accepted payment of classified government technology . Mike , that 's called treason . In this country , people get fried for that one . Yeah . You know what ? In this country , when the FBI harasses you , you also get an attorney . Thanks very much . - Not today you don 't . - What the hell is this ? This is what happens when the Attorney General calls me and says that Michael Jennings ' cooperation is a matter of national security . Look , first of all , that stuff isn 't mine , okay ? A mistake ... What is ... Perfect fit . You were saying ? Well , let me show you a few pieces of the puzzle that we 're solving . William Dekker , government physicist , weapons division . Three years ago , his project gets shelved . He didn 't like that , so he sold his work . Classified work . Showed it to several major corporations . We think Rethrick bought it . Unfortunately , we can 't link Rethrick to the sale , because Dekker died . Natural causes . " Natural " being gravity after a 140-foot fall out of his apartment building . So what does this have to do with me ? These are patent applications filed this month . They show designs based on Dekker 's work . Look whose signature is on every one of those documents . Don 't you get it ? It 's your name on those patents ! Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or where the design came from . So what you need to do is tell us everything that you did for Rethrick . Right now . - I can 't . - You 'd rather spend the rest of your life in prison protecting your so-called friend ? Just help us , and we can work with you . I can 't . I can 't ! He wiped my memory ! I don 't remember ! I 'll tell you whatever I know . I was set up . But I swear to God , you have to believe me , I don 't remember what I did for the past three years ! What ? Wait a second ! Wait ! We figured Rethrick might have tried a wipe , so we 'll try an extraction . You 're not gonna see anything . I 'm telling you , you 're wasting your time . We 're getting something here . Come on ! Come on ! Shit . We got nothing . Hold on a second . I need a smoke . Boss . He won 't mind . - Smoke ! - Shit ! - God damn it ! - I can 't see anything ! Secure the door ! Where the hell is he ? - He 's loose ! - Don 't worry , he can 't go anywhere ! Cover the door ! I 'll get the lights ! I can 't see ! Get low to the ground ! Try to stay low to the ground ! Mitchell ! See anything ? - Is that him ? - Klein , where 'd you go ? Al , shut the door ! What 's going on ? Good night , Mikey . Transit 3 , copy that . - Watch it , coming through ! - Go ! Go ! Go ! - Coming through ! - Out of the way ! - See him ? - I see him ! - Out of the way , lady ! - There ! - Move ! Move ! Move ! - Move ! - Coming through ! - Come on , let 's go ! Excuse me . Coming through ! - Out of the way ! Open those gates ! - Watch it , man . Watch it ! Come on ! Come on ! Where did he go ? Where did he go ? I 'll get men at every stop . He 'll be long gone by then ! How the hell did he do that ? - Sorry . - You all right ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm fine . - Be careful . Hey ! Hey ! Watch it ! Hey ! Hey ! Jane . Relax . Everything 's fine . I know you talked to federal agents . It 's okay . It 's been worked out now . I just need to find out who sent these items . Will you help me out ? They were sent three years ago . No , no , no . Remember , there was a mix-up . See , these weren 't the ones that were sent three years ago . Somebody else sent these . I need to find out who that is . I need talk to them . Well , you 're right , replacements were sent a few weeks ago . - Who sent it ? - Well , you did . That 's you right here . See ? Twenty items . I 'm gonna need all your personal belongings . Michael Jennings died at three minutes after 3 : 00 . The government , left with no case , closed its investigation of Allcom . So , you see , it 's impossible that he escaped unless you changed something . I didn 't . - What were you doing exactly ? - I was eating pie . He left the attorney 's office exactly when it predicted . The Feds took him exactly when it predicted ... But he didn 't die like it predicted ! Michael Jennings is not a super agent . He 's an engineer . Yet somehow he managed to escape from a double-locked room . How ? Was it fate ? No , fate was on our side . That means someone who knew changed something . And it wasn 't me . And if it wasn 't you , then who the ... Has anyone checked the machine since Michael walked out of here ? Find him . " If you only look where you can 't go , you will miss the riches below . " Yeah , I 'm already missing my riches . " 17-44-4-26-37-40-22 . " A combination ? A code ? A password ? " New Liberty Savings . " New Liberty Savings Bank , please . What does that mean ? You 're saying the bank doesn 't exist ? That 's comforting . Who sent these items ? You did . That 's you right here . See ? Twenty items . These are patent applications . Look whose signature is on every one of those documents . A mistake has been made here . I 'm not a traitor . Dekker died . Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or where the design came from . You have to believe me . I don 't remember what I did for the past three years ! Michael . You 're done . Hello ? Jesus , Shorty . You don 't know how good it is to hear a familiar voice . Michael ? Listen , man . I 'm in a jam , and I need you . All right . Meet me at Union Station at 9 : 00 . - I 'll be there . - Okay , buddy . Outbound local from Seattle to Kent departing from Track 5 . Eastbound Spokane , Gate 10 . Michael . Say one word about this hat and I 'm out of here . Oh , man ! Oh , my God . I told you not to take that job , Mike . - Come on , let 's get a table . - Okay . - Injections ? - Yeah . Yeah , you would have to do it that way , I guess . But , of course , that 's a chemical process . So ? Well , you 'd have some latent memories . Maybe that 's what I 'm seeing . Most likely . I mean , memories that made it through the wash , and then got stirred up when the Feds went into your head . Why would I have these things ? Explain this . I sent myself this junk instead of the money . Oh , brother . I don 't know . But that 's not the question you should be asking yourself . - No ? - No . The question that you should be asking yourself is , why did you give up all that money ? That 's the most bizarre part of this whole thing . $ 90 million . Nobody changes that much in three years . Okay , my buddy . I wanna figure out what you built . All right , let 's work backwards . They told me that I was working on a design by someone named Dekker . - Dekker ? - Yeah . - William Dekker ? - I think so . What I heard was , he was working on something level five for the Feds , when they came in one day and they just shut him down . - What was it ? - The consensus was a laser . - Why was that ? - Well , because Dekker 's drawings called for a mirror and a lens . Now , the only thing that uses those designs is a laser or some kind of satellite camera ... Here comes the first number , 17 . Followed by 44 . - The lens required perfect optics . - Four . - The mirror ... - Twenty-six . - So the capital outlay is huge . - Thirty-seven . - Word was the thing was gonna cost ... - Forty . ... $ 500 billion . - And the bonus number is 22 . Who the hell is gonna spend $ 500 billion just to see something ? What ? There 's no way I got out of that extraction room without the cigarettes and the glasses . I would 've never gotten on that bus without the bus ticket . If I didn 't have the diamond ring , I wouldn 't have followed that kid to Reddy Grant . - Right . - I gave up that money just to make sure that I would pay attention to these items . Why ? Because I know what you 'd spend $ 500 billion to see . The future . If you selected five of the numbers and the bonus number , you 're a second-prize winner . He used a virus . The machine went down at 3 : 03 this afternoon . 3 : 03 . Can you programme around the virus ? No . It 's not that kind of virus . Come on , I 'll show you . It 's not in the software . It 's in the hardware . He put a circuit somewhere in here . It 's like a poison pill . But you can find it , right ? Yeah , I can . Then do it . Slight change of plans . According to Mr Stevens , we don 't need Michael Jennings any more . Look , if we know anything , we know that time travel 's not possible . Einstein proved that , right ? Time travel , yes . But Einstein was very clear that he believed time viewing - theoretically could be accomplished ... - Mike , Mike , Mike , Mike . Come on . Maybe we should just find Dekker ... - I can 't talk to Dekker . - Why not ? - He had an accident . - An accident ? Yeah , he ... He fell out of his bedroom window . He fell out of ... He fell out of his bedroom window ! I see . Sure . That could happen . Jesus . Wait a minute ! - We gotta get ourselves out of here ! - Shorty , listen to me . I think what happened was I used this thing , I saw my future . And I saw what I needed to change it . But all I could get out of Allcom were these , you know , innocuous items . Each item has to be used at a specific time in a specific place to accomplish whatever it was I needed to get done . I mean , without the stuff in here , I 'd already be dead . Yeah , well , it 's too bad that you don 't know what the rest of them are for . What ? Gotcha ! Hey ! Great seeing you again , Mike ! Jesus ! Those guys do not look like Feds . Here . Listen to me . Take this . This key will get you through that door . Close it behind you . - You understand ? Go ! Go ! Go on ! - Okay ! Shit ! Go ! Oh , God , I hope that was a good thing to do . Shit . Go . Where 's your gun ? He 's got it . So , how are you , Mike ? You ? Why ? Don 't remember ? You brought this on yourself , Mike . So how does it feel knowing you 're going to die ? Shit . So you 're saying he designed his own escape ? Mr Attorney General , sir , we have no explanation . Because after looking at all the evidence , the only logical , albeit hard-to-accept conclusion , is that he was able to predict what was going to happen to him . These are memories extracted from Jennings before he fled . They don 't seem to add up to anything . Gladys . That 's all for today . We knew Dekker was trying to design something , but when he sold his plans , he wasn 't even halfway done . I don 't understand . Dekker was working at JPL on a laser-enhanced lens . He claimed the lens was powerful enough to see around the curvature of the universe . Dekker believed that if you could see around a curve that went on forever , you would end up back where you started , looking at yourself . Except you 're not looking back at yourself now , in the present . No , you are not . You 're looking at the future . Can you imagine what will happen if Jennings figures out what he 's done and tries to profit from it ? Any nation in the world would give him a king 's ransom . Jennings won 't do that . I was this close to him . He never lied . When he heard what he was being accused of , he was hurt and scared . Fine , once you bring him in , I 'll give him the Medal of Honor . That 's if Rethrick doesn 't find him first . You think he really saw the future ? That would be something . Café Michel ? My name is Michael Jennings . And I can 't remember if I made a reservation there recently . Would you check that out for me ? Thanks . I did ? Okay . Right . How many is it for ? Oh , no , thank you . No , I 'll be there . Thank you . Hello , you two . Did he feed you ? Rachel , it 's Jimmy . - You all right ? - Why ? You don 't know ? No . May I come in ? When was the last time you saw Michael ? Yesterday morning . He was pulling an all-nighter at his lab . Rachel , I 'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this . Michael left Allcom yesterday . Permanently . - What ? - He finished his work . - We erased his memory , and he ... - No . - He left . - No . He promised me . He said he wasn 't going to go through with it . He made a lot of money on this one , Rachel . He said he didn 't care about the money . So she doesn 't know anything . He wouldn 't leave without her . It 's Michael . He 'd be smart . We 're missing something . As soon as she leaves for work , get in there . And make sure she can 't go anywhere alone . I want to know what just happened . Bye , guys . Morning , Dr Porter . Going somewhere ? Good morning . I 'm going on top . Take my bag . - You 're gonna need this . - Got it . Thanks . Coming ? No , thanks . I 'd rather watch from down here . Suit yourself . Look , we 've been through the bathroom and tossed the rest of the apartment , too . Zero . This is what I want you to do . Go back in the bathroom . Okay , start turning left . Tell me what you see . The mirror . We 've got him . She 's supposed to meet him at Café Michel , 1 : 00 pm . Let 's make sure she does . I 'm here to meet someone . Michael Jennings . - Have a seat . - Thanks . Sit at that table right there . In the seat , with your back to the window . Michael , thank God you 're all right . I thought I was never gonna see you again . Michael , it 's me . Rachel . Look ... You can 't remember me . No . I 'm sorry . Cops . We can 't go in . I 'll have to wait for a clear shot . Maya , stall for time . Tell him you thought he 'd remember something . That you two were engaged . I guess I thought you 'd remember something . We 've been together for three years . I don 't know what to say . I 'm really sorry . I 'm trying . That 's how he 's doing this . Listen to me very carefully , Maya . This is what I want you to say . Michael , I can see you still have the envelope . That means it 's working . I know you switched the personal items . I helped . - You left me a note on a mirror . - You left me a note on a mirror . I 'm supposed to take something from you . I 'm supposed to take something . - Something I can use to get to Stevens . - Something I can use to get to Stevens . He 's a man you worked with . - He 's a man you worked with . - He 's trying to fix the machine . He 's trying to fix the machine . Work backwards , Michael . Yeah . Take the swipe card . That 's the swipe card for the campus . You 're supposed to give that to me . Rachel wouldn 't be hurt if he hesitated , she 'd be impatient . Look , Michael , if you can 't trust me right now , then we are lost . For good . Nice . Okay . I 'd better get back . They 'll get suspicious soon . Wait here . I 'll be back in half an hour . And don 't worry , we end up together . Michael ... I love you . - What 's my favourite baseball team ? - What ? What 's my favourite baseball team ? Who cares ? That would be the Red Sox . - I think maybe we should go . - Wait ! Now we can leave . Come on . Wait ! Hold on . - You have a car ? - I might . You might ? Look for a BMW ! You gotta be joking . Shit ! Shit ! - Let me see that key . - What ? You 're in the wrong section . Jennings bought the BMW from Southgate Auto on the Internet . He had the key mailed to him four weeks ago . - What 's the colour of his car ? - It isn 't a car . They just turned on Pine . Intercept them on Sixth . - How good am I on this thing ? - You 're okay ! - Look , I just said you 're okay , okay ? - Okay . Hang on ! - Report of shots . Southgate BMW . - Got it . - Stop ! I lost the envelope ! - What ? - I 'll come back and get you . - See you ! Got it ! Let 's get out of here . Take us down ! Mike , we can help you ! We know what 's going on ! Let us bring you in ! He 's headed for the tunnel ! Cut him off ! Cut him off ! Duck ! Split ! You think Jennings foresaw that ? Maybe next time he 'll see a nice , quiet stakeout . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . It 's all for you anyway . I brought you some clothes . I thought you might need them . I hope it 's okay . Thank you . These are mine ? You don 't remember ? No . You don 't remember me , do you ? Well ... These are for you . Happy birthday to you You 're so sweet . I 'm sorry . I just don 't remember . I shouldn 't have left . So you 're saying he sent himself a different set of personal items , ones he 'd selected after using the machine , and nothing our security would flag . Everyday things combined with the power of foresight transform Michael from engineer to escape artist . I don 't know about you , but I 'd like to return the favour . Michael , are you okay ? I 'm all right . Michael , I don 't know what you saw in your machine , but I remember a few weeks ago you came back from your lab , and you were pale . You asked me the strangest question . What ? If I knew it wouldn 't work out for you and I before we were together , would I have done it ? What did you say ? That I wouldn 't trade our time for anything . That 's all we are , the sum of our experiences . Besides , some of the best things in life are total mistakes . - What ? - You know , when I checked this envelope out at Reddy Grant , they told me I signed in 20 items , but there were only 19 . I don 't understand . What are these pictures of ? Michael , look at the rest of the pictures . Look at the last one . Oh , my God . It 's the future . The machine predicts a war , and we go to war to avert it . It predicts a plague . We herd all the sick together , create a plague . Whatever future this predicts , we make happen . We give over control of our lives completely . I did this . Seeing the future will destroy us . If you show someone their future , they have no future . You take away the mystery , you take away hope . I have to go back . I have to destroy that machine . It 's impossible . The campus is huge . There are hundreds of guards . Hey . I would not have given up the three years we had together unless I was absolutely sure I could get us 50 more . Okay . So how do we get in ? We don 't . You said everything was happening for a reason , and that includes me being here . So come on . Hey , Rachel . Another day at the most . I don 't have many more places to look . Well , I guess you weren 't as smart as you thought , Stevens . Hey , Jennings wouldn 't find it any faster unless he knew where to look . We 've got the feeds from mass transit . - He could be anywhere by now . - Except he 's not running away . He could 've given himself a way to disappear , but look what he gave himself instead . His Allcom security pass . He 's going back . Let 's get a warrant to tap the phone and data lines coming out of Allcom . Put some bodies on that campus . I want that machine ! Jennings and the girl were spotted . What do you want me to do ? Nothing . - Stay where you are . - Nobody gets through ! - Sir ! - I didn 't do anything ! Settle down ! All the metal detectors on level four just went off at the same time . Ball bearings . Just down the hall from the metal detectors . Pull the guards off the Jennings lab . Let him slip in , think he 's fooled us . Once he 's fixed the machine , take him . I built this . This door shouldn 't be open . There 's something wrong . They 're expecting us . I 'm going to close this door behind us . Keep it shut . - He 's in . - Confirmed . He 's in . Great . Once we confirm he 's at the machine , let 's go in after him . I thought we were gonna wait for him to come out . I can 't wait . Whether it 's Jennings or the machine , I don 't care as long as I get one of them . Let 's go ! This will do . Watch out . - Wait , wait . What are you doing ? - Smashing the lock . Hold on a second . You can 't just smash the thing . They 'll still be able to get in . We gotta jam the outside reader . Let 's go . Let 's take a look at the future before we destroy this thing . I bugged it . I rigged it so Jimmy wouldn 't use it against me . Then you can fix it , right ? Now , where would I have planted that bug ? Maybe on one of the motherboards . Whoa , whoa , whoa , we won 't be needing this , okay ? You 're dangerous with that thing . You must have given yourself something to help you find it . I don 't know what it would be . The only things left are the bullet and ... this . - Crossword ? - Yeah . Look at this . Twelve down . Maybe it 's here . Nine , ten , eleven , twelve . Let 's take a look . Maybe it 's a circuit diagram . I wouldn 't have put it in the primary path . Twelve down . Take him . Okay , Corridor 3 , Sublevel A , Jennings ' lab . All right , let 's put this thing to good use one last time . Let 's get us out of here . That 's in the lab . It 's the catwalk . Look , I 've changed my future before , using this thing . I can do it again . We don 't have any more time . We gotta destroy this before they get to it . Reprogram the door to Jennings ' lab , please . Now . He must 've done something to the controller . How are we gonna get out of here , Michael ? I don 't know . Clear ! - What are you doing ? - These tanks are liquid hydrogen . They 're used to cool the machine . They fire in order . Number one just fired . When it gets down to number six here , that 's all she wrote . I 'll see you when this goes off , Jimmy . Come on ! You see ? You judge too soon . They went out through the vent . Spread out and find them . Position three standing by . Come on . Freeze ! Look out . Seal off all the exits to the lab . All right , Jennings , let 's see what you 've been up to . Rachel , go for the door , okay ? Drop the gun . No ! Looks like Michael 's got a date on the catwalks . Let 's make sure he makes it . - Let 's go . - No , we can 't take the catwalk . I know . We won 't , I promise . Come on , let 's go . - Michael ! What are you doing ? - Rachel , go , go . I 'll distract them . - Go , please . - No ! Listen to me . This is my debt . I built this machine . - I have to pay for it . - No , you come with me now ! - You promised you 'd change your fate ! - Please , we don 't have time . If you love me , if you care about me , go . Have a good life . Remember me . Damn you . Jimmy . You want to kill me , come do it yourself . Here I am . You want me ? Come get me . - Hi , Jimmy . - Hi , Mike . - Looks like this is it , huh ? - Yeah , it is , Mike . - You only have yourself to blame . - That 's a lie . You can 't change your fate , Mike . You 're gonna die today . Maybe . But you 're not going to kill me . That 's right , Mike . I 've seen the future . Still think you can change your fate , Mike ? I am the future , Mike ! - Rethrick has Jennings . - Retire him . - What ? - We have the machine . We can 't risk its creator falling into the wrong hands . Come on . Don 't blame me . You and Michael would 've lived happily ever after , no memory wipe . He 's the one who saw something he didn 't like . He 's the one who decided he wanted to stop the programme . Look at it this way , you did change the future , Michael . Before you interfered , you both would 've lived , we would still be friends , instead of ending up like this . It wasn 't meant to be . Giving up so easy ? Don 't you believe in second chances ? To tell you the truth , I do . Go , go , go . Rachel ! Let 's go . Gus , look . Any records ? Any papers ? Explosion destroyed everything . Are we trying to salvage that or what ? Guess we don 't get the machine , do we ? Any sign of Jennings ? No , I 'm afraid he didn 't make it . What was Shorty thinking , starting a nursery ? I mean , these plants are on life-support . What do you mean ? Really ? He told me he had a green thumb . Gangrene is more like it . Lucky for Shorty , I 'm a biologist . Well , lucky for both of us . Since I failed biology , - I 'm no help to either one of you . - So you say . Too bad , though , because I 'm looking for a partner - for a start-up company . - Really ? Doing what ? Wanna save the world . I don 't think I 'm your guy . But would you settle for someone who wants to help you change it ? - Okay . - Good . So how does it end for us , Michael ? I mean , what 's in our future ? You know , I don 't know . I kind of like it that way . - I do know one thing . - What 's that ? I never want to forget anything ever again . Break it up , break it up . The birdman cometh . - Shorty . - It 's dinner . - You found them . - Yes , I did . Who does everything for everybody around here ? - You do . - You 're right . - You are my hero . - Thank you very much . - You hear that ? I 'm a hero . - That 's great . Hi . I think I remember . Are those our birds ? Yes , of course they are . We bought them together . You remember the birds ? Well done . You could see into the future and all you remember are Polly and Tweety there . Why don 't you remember something that would make us rich , huh , Mike ? - Wait a second . - What is it ? - I think there was something else . - No , no , no . The envelope 's empty . Don 't worry about it . Hold on . I 'm working backward here . " If you only look where you can 't go , you will miss the riches below . " I must 've known you would never get rid of these birds , right ? Of course not . They 're family . So I knew this would be here . What only looks where it can 't go ? A caged bird . " You will miss the riches below . " The riches below . What is that ? Well , that 's a $ 90-million lottery ticket . - Wait . Wait a minute . - It 's $ 90 million . - Nice . - Just looked at it . Yes , I 'm proud of it . Wait a minute . No . - Wait . - What are you doing ? You know what ? I think now 's probably a good time to discuss my commission , 33 % . - I thought it was 5 % . - No , 33 % . - 33 % ! - Absolutely . - We had a deal at 5 % . - He deserves it . He deserves it . It was found on my premises . I 'll get back to you . I 'm gonna cash this in .

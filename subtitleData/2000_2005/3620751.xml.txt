 I 'm on the Clay Street platform . Got a fare jumper . White male , shaved head , 20s . Possible 10-13 . Officer Philbrick . All clear . Deputy Chief Karras , Transit Police . Lieutenant Bianco . - You 're Scully and Doggett ? - Yes . - ls the assessment team here ? - Downstairs , waiting . Where have you been ? Agent Scully needed to examine the body of the victim first . Who 's missing the picture here ? I got lots of people can examine the body . What I need from the fbi now is a time frame . A time frame ? A main artery of the Boston transport system has been closed for exactly 11 hours and four minutes . My phone is ringing off the hook with calls from the press . I got 100,000 pissed-off commuters who were late to work , who will be even more pissed off if they can 't get home . And I got one extremely pissed-off mayor paying me to keep the damn trains running . - We appreciate the pressure you 're under ... - lt 's you guys better kick it in the ass . The afternoon rush starts in five hours . Do what you gotta do , but the line is going back into operation at 4pm . - l 'm afraid you can 't do that . - Yes , I can . You 've got a dead man who 's got over one third of his body tissue eaten away , and until we figure out how and why , that tunnel cannot be reopened . We understand the fbi 's need to do an investigation , but , as I see it , the facts of this case are pretty simple . - Simple ? - The train briefly lost power , during which time an assailant killed a Boston transit cop . That man is still at large . - An assailant using what ? - Acid ? Lye ? - Your examination must 've told you . - No , it didn 't . That 's the thing . Until we culture the tissue and run tests , we won 't know what killed him or if it can infect others . The Centers for Disease Control had robotic sniffers in the tunnel all night . They found no trace of biological or chemical agents . So let 's clear this up . What we 're looking for is a man - a cop killer . A single suspect . At least , that 's your cover story . That 's what you 're telling the press . The question is : can you get me the killer or an explanation in five hours ? Cos , hell or high water , the subway reopens at 4pm sharp . Now let 's go . Steven Melnick . Transportation Authority 's chief structural engineer . He built this tunnel . I only oversaw construction of it four years ago. I know every square inch down there . Dr Hellura Lyle , Special Pathogens Branch , CDC . We were told the tunnel was clear of pathogens . Well , I guess I 'm just here for the moral support . We 're just covering our bases . - What base are they covering ? - Agent Scully is a medical doctor , who , they tell me , has a lot of experience with equivocal death . Equivocal ? I mean , you 're dead or you 're not , right ? Deaths which may have many explanations or for which an explanation may be hard to find . What about you ? - l 'm just a good shot . - Good . Now that we 're bosom buddies , let 's get this show on the road . - You need some help with that ? - No . - You 're going in without me . - What ? I don 't know what games are being played but I 'm gonna be much more effective analyzing the situation from up here . Yeah , then I 'm just a tagalong here . This is your thing . You 've got all the experience . You 've got capable people with you , Agent Doggett . What I need down there are eyes and ears . OK . I 'll be your eyes and ears . Only I wish someone would tell me what the hell it is I 'm supposed to be looking for . Third rail 's powering down . You 're clear to enter the subway floor . As long as you stay on this line , there should be no risk of accidental shock or electrocution . - You copy that , Agent Doggett ? - Yep . We 're on the tunnel floor . Hope you got yourself a nice , clear picture , Agent Scully . We got you every step of the way . - lt feels like Atlanta in August . - Yeah. lt 's the middle of winter . - How come it 's so hot down here ? - They shut down ventilation last night . Normally you have almost a million cubic feet of fresh air per minute pushing through here . But now we 're in a sweatbox . Aren 't we lucky ! Hot , sticky , and crawling in the dark . All so every commuter in Boston can get home to watch Survivor ll . I wonder why they shut down the ventilation if it 's a man we 're looking for . If you doubt that so much , Agent Doggett , why bring a gun ? Agent Doggett , you still reading me ? Like a songbird , Agent Scully . - My neck . Get it off . - What 's going on ? - lt 's burning . - Hold still . Whatjust happened ? He 's got a burn on his neck , silver-dollar size . - You get seepage down here ? - Yeah , constantly . This line was tunneled through landfill adjacent to the harbor . Part of the Big Dig . There was a puddle 20 yards back . - You hear that , Agent Scully ? - Yeah . Ask Dr Lyle if she can get a sample . - We need you to get a sample . - OK. I 'm on it . Maybe it 's not a man we 're looking for , but some sort of toxic leak . We were told there are no contaminants down here . Tell her I 'm sending this . We 're transmitting . - You online , Agent Scully ? - Yeah , I got it . I 'm getting a reading . Sample analysis is showing carbon , bromide , boron and calcium . It 's just sea water . Let me get on the phone . Maybe I can get a molecular analysis . Four hours , Agent Scully . Take it easy . Agent Doggett . What ? - What is it ? - There 's somebody in the tunnel . All right , let 's go find him . Open this line in four hours , passengers 'll get more than just a ride . They 'll get a steam bath to boot . What are you doing ? If this guy was gonna shoot me , he had his chance . Besides , I 'm sweatin ' like a pig . Mr Melnick , what 's this ? It 's a tunnel from the old system . Been shut down for years . You see this , Agent Scully ? You have this on your graphic ? Yeah. lt 's a fork in the line . That line is obsolete . It 's been gutted and decommissioned . How far from here to where the train lost power , Agent Scully ? It 's about a mile up the main tunnel . He 's gonna waste valuable time going in there . Agent Doggett ? - Agent Doggett . - l 'm just taking a look . Let 's get out of here . Mr Melnick , what 's your call ? is there any good reason to pursue this section ? Lots of places to hide in here . - Dr Lyle ? - Agent Doggett , look out . Agent Doggett , what happened ? Can you hear me ? Yeah . No . Give me a minute . What hit me ? He came at you like some kind of phantom . What did ? Agent Doggett ? - Would you call that equivocal ? - Agent Scully ? OK , I see it . - l 'm gonna need some data . - Agent Scully needs some data . - l 'm already on it . - l think this guy killed Officer Philbrick . I 'm transmitting some photos . Here comes your data , Agent Scully . Oh , my God . - Where are you goin ' ? - l think I just saw something . - What 's the problem ? - There 's no problem . This man fits the description called in by my transit cop . We 've found what we were looking for . Let 's get him wrapped up and go home . See it ? There 's something on the floor . Agent Scully , we got bodies . Looks like three males . - Agent Scully ? - Yeah , I see ' em . Can you get any closer ? The smell 's a little overpowering . They 've been here for a while . Someone wrapped ' em up and stashed ' em here . Can you get them uncovered ? They look like squatters , from the way they 're dressed . I 'm not sure I wanna touch these . I see signs of the same tissue degradation we saw in the other victims . We may have a contagion here after all . What did she say ? Dr Lyle . Down here . CDC may be wrong . Somebody 's over here . Agent Doggett ? Whatever she saw ... - What did you see ? - Somebody out here just took off . - l don 't see where . - We 're done down here . - Agent Doggett . - Hold it , Lieutenant . If there 's somebody else down there , you need to find them . What are you doing ? Get those people out . They found three dead bodies . I want to know what happened to them . They are in an obsolete , decommissioned tunnel . I 'll get a crew down there tonight , after rush hour . They could be infected and contagious . With what ? Sea water ? You are being irrational here . The CDC says there are no contaminants . I 'm gonna take their word on it . Then who are those dead men and how did they die ? Probably tunnel rats , squatters , attacked by the same man who killed my transit cop . Then take a look at the man who fits the description of your killer , OK ? Just look at his injuries . He died the same way . There is something down there. I will not risk bringing it up here until I figure out what it is . - Agent Scully ? - Yeah ? What do you want us to do ? Leave those bodies where you found them and go after whoever is in that tunnel . We need to know whether he is causing this , or if he 's infected himself . Either way , he may kill more people . I 'm sure Dr Lyle will agree . All right , we just got our order . - We 're gonna continue on . - Says who ? Says the boss . Agent Doggett . This agent you work with deals with weird stuff , right ? She works on something called the X-Files . fbi cases of unexplained phenomena . - You know her at all ? - Yeah , I know her . We 've worked together for a short time . I wonder why she sent you down here instead of coming herself . It 's the right call . You got a problem , Lieutenant ? Yeah , when somebody I don 't know keeps me down here in the dark looking forjack squat when we 've already found our man . - lt 's a question of contagion . - lt 's a question of who 's in charge . Agent Doggett ? - Yeah . - You all right down there ? Fine . What have you got for us ? You 're about 50 yards from the spot where the train stopped . What am I looking for ? I don 't know . Anything . Get it off me . - What is it ? - l don 't know , but it burns . - Just hold still . Let us see it . - lt burns . What is it ? What 's happening ? - Agent Doggett ? - l can 't tell what it is . Agent Scully , talk to me . Yeah ... Get some fresh water on it . Give me water here . What the hell was that ? I don 't know , and I don 't like it that you don 't . Agent Scully , talk to me . I don 't know what to say . It 's something attacking the dermis . Attacking ? It ate his arm off . I hate to say this , but it looks like some kind of biochemical weapon . Great . - What ? - What did she say ? She said a lot of people might be taking cabs home tonight . What the hell is this thing ? It might be a terrorist using a biochemical agent . Might ? is she guessing ' ? Agent Doggett , I pulled up a map of the subway grid where you are now . I want you to listen to me . She says this tunnel connects to another tunnel 100 yards up . It 's the only place this guy could be hiding . - This man ain 't goin ' nowhere . - Then you take care of him . I 'll have a HAZMAT team come down here . Lieutenant , let 's go . We 're gonna get you out of here . Come on . I got you , buddy . Hang in there . Dr Lyle . - Dr Lyle , how are you feeling ? - Me ? I seem to be OK , but Melnick is getting worse . Vehicles are on the way . The CDC doctors know of your conditions . What are they gonna be treating us for ? - How are they gonna treat Melnick ? - l 'm working on that . What are you doing ? Where are you taking them ? Those bodies go to the CDC . As a federal agent , I order you to stop . Agent Scully , we are on a deadline here which is fast approaching . These bodies need immediate examination and diagnosis . - That is being arranged . - By whom ? I already arranged it . - You knew those bodies were down there . - Watch yourself , Agent Scully . Look at the way they 're wrapped . Somebody sealed them in plastic hoping they wouldn 't be found . If you sent my partner down there knowing about this ... You are way out of line here . I want to see inspection reports . I want to know who was down there in that tunnel and what they saw . - l 'll get you anything you want . - Good . Let 's get these bodies to the CDC where they 're supposed to go . - What 's this here , Lieutenant ? - Abandoned station . Old stop . Agent Scully . Here we are , pissin ' away our time , and she 's asleep at the wheel . Come on , Agent Doggett . Make a decision . Let 's get out of here . We gotta find whoever it is that 's still down here , Lieutenant . And what if we don 't find him ? Maybe it 'll be us they find lying face down on the floor , dead . Agent Scully knows what she 's doing . - This is about saving people 's lives . - lt looks like it 's about saving her life . If she knows what she 's doing , why hasn 't she figured it out yet ? Lieutenant ... - Walk towards me . - What ? What , damn it ? The stuff 's on me . You see that ? It 's spreading . I told you we should 've gotten out . That 's exactly why we gotta stay . You saw . You saw what it does . Yeah , I saw what it did . But I don 't see it having any other effect on you , so just calm down . No. I 'm gettin ' out of here. I 'm leavin ' . - You 'd do it , wouldn 't you ? - Not because I want to . But you 're pushin ' pretty hard . So put your weapon down , Lieutenant , right now . Now , we 're gonna get out of here , but we 're gonna wait for the OK . Agent Doggett , can you ... Come in , Agent Doggett . Come in , damn it . is this a bad time ? Excuse me ? I don 't know. I 'm looking for an fbi agent , Dana Scully . - Do you know where l can find him ? - No . Yes. I mean , I 'm she . - Can I help you ? - Yes. I 'm Dr Kai Bowe . I was sent a scribbled note and a saltwater sample for analysis . I 'm a marine biologist from BU . I 'm sorry . Yes . Dr Bowe , please . - Did you get an analysis ? - Yes. I have something to show you . I 'm going to assume you 're in a hurry . This is an image taken from a stereomicroscope of what 's called a medusa . Your saltwater sample was deceiving . Its components are as you 'd expect , except for higher levels of calcium . This creature is primarily that . - Calcium ? - Yes . It 's what powers its movement and gives it bioluminescence . So you 're saying that this is a sea creature . - Which is why the CDC missed it . - Well , it 's hard to find . I dare say I 'm not even sure if it 's of the sea , but ... wherever it 's from , it 's quite incredible . It 's killing people . - How ? - l don 't know . There is sea water in that tunnel , and it 's eating people 's flesh off . It 's producing some kind of a reaction that looks almost electrical . - On contact ? - No . Something triggers it . - Have you been in the tunnel ? - No , I have not . But my partner is down there , and I fear the worst . Anybody out there ? Somebody . Anybody hear me ? Anybody ? Agent Doggett , can you hear me ? Yeah . I 'm here. I hear you . God , you frightened me . I started fearing the worst . No , I got blindsided by ... I don 't see Lieutenant Bianco . He 's infected with something . I saw it glowing ' on his skin . And what 's your condition , Agent Doggett ? I 'm gonna assume it 's not good . I 'm gonna send a quarantine unit down to get you. I want you to stay right where you are . I appreciate it , but I can 't do that . If we 're gonna stop the spread of this thing , I gotta stop Lieutenant Bianco . Dr Bowe , I need you to get on the phone with the CDC . Tell them everything we know . We have to learn as quickly as possible what sets this thing off . Look , I need you to blockade any and every exit from this system . You 've got a possible outbreak situation . - That 's not going to happen . - No , you listen to me . Your lieutenant is infected and at large in the system , looking for a way out . I hear you . It 's just that there are already passengers waiting on the platform . Agent Doggett , we 've got a new wrinkle . Don 't tell me . We 're running out of time. lt 's 20 to four . - l 'm moving as fast as I can . - You shouldn 't be moving at all . In 20 minutes I 'll be taking a long bath at the hotel . Right now , I gotta find this guy . This organism that 's on your skin , something triggers it , and I don 't know what . It could be body temperature or heart rate . It could be from standin ' still too , right ? Maybe the only thing keeping me from sparking ' up right now is that I 'm movin ' . Yeah. I guess you 're right . I 'm gettin ' out of this thing , Agent Scully . Just make sure Karras holds those trains till I find Bianco . He 's got passengers waiting at the next station . You tell that son of a bitch he 's gotta clear the system . He 's ... Wait. I see something . Lieutenant ... He 's hurt . You see this , Dr Bowe ? You see this , Mr Karras ? You got the CDC ? I need anything they can give me about what sets this organism off . An idea , a notion , a wild guess . Agent Scully , what do you want me to do ? Get out of there , Agent Doggett . What about this man ? I 'm gonna send a HAZMAT team down for him , but from what I 've seen ... the reaction 's progressive . Please , Agent Doggett , don 't leave me here . I hope you enjoy the ride . See this , Agent Scully ? Yeah . - Who else is down there ? - We don 't know . You there . Stop . Federal agent. I 'm armed . Agent Scully , you believe this ? Who are you ? What 's your name ? What are you doin ' down here ? What 's he pointing at ? I don 't know . - ls he infected ? - Agent Doggett , turn the light away . Nothing . He 's unaffected . - How 's that ? - l think I just figured it out . I might know what triggers this . - What is it ? - Sweat . Perspiration is a conductor for calcium ions , promoting a chemical-electrical reaction . - Electricity ? - That 's right . The boy 's sweat glands aren 't fully developed , so he wouldn 't be as conductive . Just my luck . - Agent Doggett , where is he going ? - l don 't know , but he wants me to follow him . Agent Scully , I don 't know if you can see this . I think I found the source of the contagion . Looks like a big leak in the ceiling is crumbling the walls , flooding into the system . It must have seeped in from the bay . Where are you goin ' ? You see this ? The kid 's walkin ' right through this stuff . Yeah. I 'm checking my graphic here . It looks like he 's trying to lead you through to a tunnel on the main system . And if this is accurate , it would put you about 400 yards from an access point . If I could put a HAZMAT team together , we might be able to have you out in 15 minutes . Come on , Lieutenant . We 're through to the main system , Agent Scully . We got big problems here . Yes , we do . - You see this flooding ' ? - No , it 's worse than that . I think this moron Karras has started the trains rolling . Agent Doggett , what are you doing ? Get off the tracks , Agent Doggett . Get out of there . We got people on the train . They could get infected . Get out of there , Agent Doggett . Give it to me . I got an idea , Agent Scully . Agent Doggett ? Talk to me , Agent Doggett . Agent Doggett ? Are you there ? Can you hear me ? Yeah , I 'm here . Thank God . I lost you on the visual . OK . OK , I 've got you . You 're back . Are you OK ? I can only hope , Agent Scully . Nurse . Where do you think you 're going ? To find the nurse . She said she was gonna talk to the doctor about me goin ' home . I could be dyin ' in here for all she knows . Well , you 're not , Agent Doggett . Your skin and body are rid of the organism . A simple alcohol bath cleaned you right up . I was just down talking to the nurse and ... I told her I 'd come and give you the news . Well , can I get outta here ? Yes . What about the others ? Well , the kid is with Social Services . Plastic surgeons are working on Melnick and Bianco . And Dr Lyle has been discharged . You know , I 'd like to think that this is over . But there 's gonna be hell to pay for these guys . No , it 's over , Agent Doggett . Excuse me ? This guy Karras put a train back on the tracks . - He recklessly endangered people 's lives . - But there is no proof of that . What do you mean , there 's no proof ? What I 'm saying is that the organism is no longer extant . - lt 's destroyed . - By what ? I 'm guessing by the electrical charge that you set off . We got victims . Dead bodies . lnfected by a pathogen of unknown etiology . Look , Agent Doggett , not a criminal charge is gonna stick . These guys were just doing theirjob . Keeping the trains running . But they 've got you to thank . And notjust for saving their butts . No . You figured it out . I was just your eyes and ears . Agent Scully ... Let 's go home .

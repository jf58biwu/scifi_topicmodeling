Driving gloves , driving goggles , driving thong . There ! Maybe I should drive . You ? A woman ? I 'm trying to catch a monster , not to find the quickest route to the mall ! Let me just adjust the seat . My God ! He 's gonna do it ! Everyone , seatbelts to maximum buckling . Pazzuzzu ! Hey , grandpa move your wrinkly old keester . Shut up ! For Heaven 's gate , professor ! This ship can do 99 % light speed , why are we going 35 mph ? Because we 're in a hurry ! That 's why ! Plus , you have the highbeams on . I can 't quite read the sign . Pazzuzzu ! Pazzuzzu ! Yo ! Captain Cateract . What are we doing here ? Oh , it 's 2h30 , we can still catch the early bird dinner special . Aren 't we looking for your gargoyle ? My what ? Hello Maywis . Surprise to see me back again so soon . Maywis is dead . I expect you 'll want to see my angry , crotchety grandpa discount card .

Well I can 't keep them in my mouth , they 're nuclear powered ! It bit my finger . No , no , it tasted human blood ! Damn good meat ! Professor , we 've talked it over , and everybody think , you 're too old . Right on . We 've decided to do merciful thing , and have you youth-a-size . Dear God , no ! Oh , relax professor . Youth-a-sizing is a trendy new spa treatment . It 's this season 's , shark cartilage enema . But I like being old . I don 't have to talk to my parents . No one ask me to help move this stuff . I don 't need to understand today 's HDTV sitcoms . We 're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence : Get him ! My thong ! Hi , I 'm Heather , your personal youth-a-sizer . Let 's get start with nice botulism treatment , shall we ? Go to hell , Heather ! In small doses botulism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles . Instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable . Give me back my flappy face . Careful with the giblets . You 're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints . More pressure . Since this is such a serious case of old . We 'll have to try our strongest treatment . A suiting full body bath . In searing hot tar . Sir , it 's not necessary or wise to be naked . You sound just like my tennis instructor . The tar blisters the age right out of the body , in what top scientists suspect is a miracle . Oh , I don 't have time for this . I have to go buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it , making people wait behind me while I complain . He still sounds sorta old . Sorta real old . Step aside lady . Like everything else in life , pumping is just a permanent degenarated form of bending . Bender , pump harder , harder . I 'm trying as hard as I can . Harder damn you ! Well , that was an utter waste of time . Professor , it worked ! You look young enough to be my father ! Poodle spit ! 53 years old ? ! Now I 'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn . This is cool , professor . We shall go out and celebrate ! Dear Lord ! You 've all reverted to your childhood forms ! Hurray , I 'm a teenage heart throb again . While I 'll try to restore our normal ages , I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsable professionals . It wasn 't me , Mr. F. It was Amy . Stop it , Amy . You stink ! You know you did it . Quiet ! Quiet I say ! We 're here to take my little stub of a husband home . Hermies , say goodbye to mister Farnsworth . Goodbye , mister Dumbsworth . This is my chance to spend time with my parents too . But , you parents are grouse sewer mutants . When I was an orphan , I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad . And now , thanks to being hurled backwards within time ... That 's not what happened ! Shut up and go live with your parents ! It 's gonna be totally awesome mom . You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face . And if some kid picks on me , my dad can beat up his dad . Can I just beat up the kid ? Well , OK Leela . If you think you can put up with your father , welcome home . We 'll try to respect your indepedance and freedom . No ! I want the real teen experience . Chores , curfew ... the works ! Fine , sweetikins , we 'll be the strictest parents ever . Now , let 's all have some tequila to celebrate ! Dad ... I 'm underage ! Oh , right . Here 's a silly straw . Ohh ... My Amy , sweet little girl again . This is like a mother 's dream . Bad dream that is . At this rate , I 'm never gonna get a grandchild . Maybe she not grown up . But she sure grown out ! She fat ! Dad , if you 're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again , I 'm just gonna stay in my room ! Stay in room ? You so fat , you gonna stay all around room . I 've got to find the way to escape the horrible ravages of youth . Suddenly , I 'm going to the bathroom like clockwork . Every three hours . And those jerks of social security stopped sending me checks . Now I have to pay them . I 'm tired of you yapping . All you ever do is complain . You never tried to make things better . Well , I 'm running away from this deadened family . I know there is a place for people like me , with new ideas . There has to be ! Fine , get going . Oh , I 'm going . You gonna be all like : where 's Bender , I miss Bender ... We won 't know that until you leave . I 'm leaving . There 's the door . I 'll be good . Do you have to shed your skin on that couch ? We 're don 't living in a zoo ! I 'm getting the door bell . For me ? Oh , hello sir . It 's lovely evening you have tonight . I 'm here to pick up your daughter . Hi , Fry ! I like your blazer . Thanks . These aren 't pockets , they just flaps . I put my money in my sock . So where are you taking my daughter tonight ? A movie . Ehm , a movie madame . Well , whatever you 're really doing , don 't wake us if you get in after 12 . Dad ? ! You 're being too lenient again . I have to be back by 11 . OK , OK , your the boss . No , I 'm not ! I 'd like a sewer burger . But without the rat faeces . What ? You 're on the diet ? Leela , you look hot ! Jeez Moose , just dump me right in front of her , why don 't you . Moose , Mandy , this is my friend Fry . From the surface . Ah ! So this is the famous Fry . What is he like , the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer ? They 're on to me ! Hey , come on , let 's act like growns-up here . Wanna race ? Da , yeah ! There , the world 's drinking water is safe for another day . A Tapeworm ! We 've missed the turn , we 'll never catch them . Yes , we will . This sewer goes right under the Planet Express , and it 's 9 p.m. The Devil take this predictable colon . Alright ! Leela , you can stop winning now , we won ! I 'm too short to reach the handbrake . That 's detention ! And then , and then , a giant tapeworm tried to play us for champs . But we like totally dismoosed . Yes I like to meet this Moose . But in the meantime , I had good news . I may have solved our age problem . It seems the youth-a-sizing tar was saturated with time altering chronotons . A thin layer is still stucked to our DNA , as well as Bender 's roll or RNA . Question ! Yes . You stink ! Yes , yes . Anyhow I 've designed an oil eating bacteria that should take the tar right off . Come on . Let 's go tell Leela , so we can grow up together . Thanks profesor , but I don 't want the treatment . Don 't you understand you little nitwit . Unless you are treated soon , the only way to restore your true age , would be to grow into it . Just as GOD INTENDED ! He has a point , honey . What about your job and your friends ? Do you really want to abandon your old life ? My old life wasn 't as glamorous as my web page made it look . All I ever wanted was to grow up here ... with you . Please . Well , if it 's what you really want . It is . I know it is . I 'll miss you , Leela . I 'll come back and visit when I 'm all grown up . Bring beer . No beer ' till you finish your tequila ! The age restoring microbes are ready . Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber . Let 's go Yes , everyone do the same thing . Initiating controlled infection . I am not doctor , but this machine guy could use a lozenge . We 're even younger ! The bacteria peak down on the tar , and now they getting freeky-deeky , spreading chronotons through out our systems . We 're getting younger by the minute . What ? I 'm gonna revert through all my larval stages ? Word . We 'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death . Pre-life ! Then death . I 've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of unbirth . Think , you disco duck fake . What 's that squirm under your shirt ? Oh , get off me , you parasitic lamp-ray ! Oh sure , you need all your blood . Could you all chill ? I can 't think with you kids cramping my style . I need a babysitter . OK , quiet time ! I know . Everyone pretend that goblin ate your tongues and I 'll read you a story . Uh , story ! I can 't see from down here I can 't . There . Today 's story is from Muteen Magazine . Who would you rather hear about ? Four legged Chachi , or tenacle Chachi ? I wanna hear a space story . It 's kind of baby book . But OK . Let 's see - snowhite dwarf and the seven red dwarves . Charlotte 's Tholian Web . The Fountain of Aging . The Fountain of Aging ? It is just a legend . Still , they called the tooth fairy a legend and now it 's head of the FBI . So , kids ready ? Profess is back ! You smell like smoking ... and drinking . I had a few beers , but I 'm cool to drive . I wish I could come with you to say goodbye , before you all turn back into grown-ups . But I 'm grounded for knocking the school over . Who cares , Leela . It was just a public school . Now go with your friends . Please . No ! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room . Until she sneaks out . When I grow up I want to be a steam shovel . According to this , the fountain is located in the darkest , most ancient region of space . Just past Teddy-Bear Junction . Teddy-Bear Junction . The worst scum-hole in the galaxy . This solar system is like way old . Look how the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet . News flash ! Everything 's getting older the closer we get to that ancient burned out sun . Dude , the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself . Shut up , I was gonna say that ! We 've got to hurry , the kids have only one change of pants . We gotta be real , real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again . Zoidberg ! Get out of there ! The current ! It 's too much already . Help ! Zoidberg is dead ! No ! Zoidberg 's brother is dead ! Funny story . I just reverted to the age when my siblings budded from me , and my brother Norman split of and jumped in the fountain . He always had to be the center of attention . Naughty of him to let him go . Oh no ! Quick ! Get them in the fountain ! Thanks for the help , Leela . Once we 're grown-ups , you could go back to your family . We 'll never bother you again . Oh , you could bother me a little . It 's working ! Hurray ! I can 't hold on ! I 'm coming in after you ! No Leela ! You can 't give up your childhood . You 'll never have another chance at it . We did it ! We 're the right ages again . I think I might be a couple years younger ! Me too ! Help ! I 'm still in mid-peril , you clowns . He 's too far out . We can 't reach him . With my last breath , I curse Zoidberg ! Pazzuzzu ! Oh , you came back to me . Are you back to your original age , professor ? Even older . I 'm sorry you had to give up being a kid , Leela . Well , I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes . But I 've worked hard to be the person I am . The fabulous person . With friends like you , guys ! Fabulous friends . And I 'm really happy I have that life back . And you my faithful friend , how can I ever repay you ? And that , little one , is how pappa gets freedom . Now , bonne nuit , bonne nuit ... to you all . Transcription : K5 crew

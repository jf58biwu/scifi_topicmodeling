Lately , when I walk the streets , I feel like people are looking at me . It 's only a hunch so I really can 't ask anyone . What matters more now , is that I 'm sleepy . Morning , Class Rep ! Hey , morn ... What 's wrong ? I couldn 't get to sleep last night . About our secret ... He just saw it . Nothing happened after that and you guys just let me go , so I kept thinking that , in the middle of the night , Moriyama might show up again with a mask on , and ... Who 's going to show up ? Th ... there she is ! How rude . You can relax . We 're not going to bother you anymore . Huh ? The issue is out of our hands now . Anyway ... Subaru ! Yes ? About what you said I was thinking about it , over and over inside my head all night long . Which part ? Anyway , I just have to tell you this ! Muryou Subaru ! What ? Thank you . I 'm sorry . I 've learned a great deal from this . And ... ! And ? I hate you ! I really , really , really , totally hate you ! Yo ! Are you having a lover 's quarrel this early in the morning ? The vice president likes the transfer kid . Shun ! Hey ! Wait ! Hey ! No way ! Wait ! I never knew Moriyama was so funny . I wonder if she gets her oddball tendencies from being so serious ? You got off lucky . All you lost was some sleep . You should be glad . You really are something . Yes . The situation was currently serious and extremely grave ... The vice president likes the transfer kid ! Yes . The situation was currently serious and extremely grave ... Yes . The situation was currently serious and extremely grave ... Supposedly , but ... Wait Shun ! Supposedly , but ... Wait Shun ! ... there 's no way that a normal eighth grader would understand that . Is it you ? Are you supposed to be the country bumpkin that showed up here ? Who are you ? That 's what I want to ask you . All right ! Follow me . KOnaya SnaCk-shOp KOnaya SnaCk-shOp I see . So you 're from Planet Zaigle . I see . So you 're from Planet Zaigle . Why did you come to this planet ? Who are you ? How do you know about our planet ? The political situation , history , and general affairs of planets affiliated with the Federation are all common knowledge for a foreign diplomat . Diplomat ? A word of advice . There are rules here . Go back to your home planet immediately before the people of Earth do you in . Us ? By the earthlings ? Don 't mock me ! We 're ... Zaiglians , right ? I know ... I know , because my planet 's the one that recommended your planet to the Federation . What ? I 'm Jiltosh , a Velunnian . I 'm a first class foreign diplomat , acknowledged by the Galactic Federation . Then can we agree that the issue regarding the boy , Hajime Murata will be entrusted to me ? We don 't mind , but I wonder how the other four families will ... Don 't worry . I will take care of that . Lady Momoe , you seem to be very enthusiastic about this . Yes . I think it has brought back old memories . I 'm so bored . Muryou Subaru , please ! Oh . It 's you again . Are you serious ? About what ? I found out when I was strangling Shun ! What do you mean you volunteered to be the rep for both the Athletic and Cultural Festivals and on top of that , the Cheer Captain for the Athletic Festival ? What do I mean ? It 's exactly what you just said . You 're completely underestimating student government activities ! No I 'm not . Your apathetic attitude means you 're underestimating it ! What were you thinking ? Can I leave it as ... " I want to get to know you better ? " I think you 're really cute . I knew there was something going on this morning ! Uh ... no ... Details ! Details ! Quiet over there ! I know what you 're up to . You 're using the student government as an excuse to avoid the sports club recruiters . I won 't allow it ! But ... it was your fellow officer 's idea . No ! Why ? Because I can handle both ! Exactly ! Muryou ! That 's right ! You can handle both study and sports ! Well , sounds enticing , but ... Join our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Well , you see ... Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! It 's kind of a problem to just pick one club , too ... Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Our club ! Then let 's do this . If you can 't pick one , pick all of them . Join all of them and make yourself useful ! Why do I have to do that ? Did you see his moves ? After him ! Go up to the roof . What ? You said this morning that you wouldn 't bother me anymore . Murata ... Don 't ask any questions and just let me use this on you . That again ? You and that alien both ! What is that thing ? A paralyzer that 's been authorized by the Galactic Federation . It can paralyze nerves ... and alter brain cells . I 'm going to erase your memory . I should have done this two days ago when I had the chance . W ... wait ! What do you think you 're doing ? My memory ? Which memory ? About my power , the secret of Shingu , all sorts of things ... Your memory from the last couple of days ... Lately , this is all that 's been happening to me . S ... stop ... This is for your own good , Murata . Sorry , Murata ! How naughty ! Aggressive girls are great ! But , nobody likes someone who doesn 't know what they want , Nayuta . Who are you ? Setsuna . Hajime , are you all right ? Don 't trap yourself in a corner . Apparently Grandma Momoe said she 'd meet with Hajime . Grandma , from our clan ? By the way , you need to be more careful . What are you guys doing ? The door wouldn 't open , so ... This door is really broken . Oh , that 's right . I brought him lunch . Lunch ? Lucky you ! Want some ? Lucky ! Don 't do that . That 's inconsiderate . You 're such a goody-goody . I 'm allowed to be , because I 'm the class rep . Hey ! Someone bring his cushion ! So what were you and Moriyama doing on the roof ? I was getting blackmailed slash persuaded , I guess ? Blackmailed ? " Do something about Muryou Subaru ! Aren 't you the class rep ? " This class is so crazy . How so ? Subaru and Ha-chan . We have two not-so-normal people in this class . Yup . Yup . I think that 's pretty interesting . What ? You 're treating us like we 're weirdos ! Subaru maybe , but I 'm a normal boy ! A normal boy that 's not normal . Hey ! Then , how aboutjust " abnormal " ? That 's even worse ! She made it so no one could come up on the roof after me . Normally I think things through , but when those two are involved , I turn into this space cadet that makes dumb mistakes ! Amateur ! Amateur ! Amateur ! Amateur ! Amateur ! Amateur ! Shape up , me ! That 's fine , but you should stop saying your thoughts out loud . Ow ! Record of the School Wars : MURYOU See you later . What ? Nayuta and Muryou are passionately in love ? Nayuta was hitting on him this morning and Muryou told her that he likes her . The whole school 's talking about it . The whole school ? I haven 't heard it ! I knew about it . I did too . Nayuta ... fell for a fake like him ? ! A fake ? You 're the one who knows his strength best . And why not ? A tomboy like Nayuta is a perfect match for someone strange like him . Putting that aside , Shun Morihata . You stink like milk . It 's the wild horse 's fault ! Milk comes from a cow . A horse ! The one who is destined to protect the name of the Sanemori Clan can 't date some random chump ! I won 't allow it ! It 's dripping onto the newspaper ! First Athletic Festival Representatives Meeting Yes , so , Muryou Subaru from second year homeroom C has volunteered to be the White Team Cheer Captain . Traditionally , the third year athletic council members would discuss this , pick the nominees and decide on someone , but this year , before we could even do that , I was told by the class rep of second year homeroom C that Subaru had volunteered . And so I 'd like everyone to ... Um , excuse me . And so I 'd like everyone to ... Um , excuse me . What is it , second year class C ? I 'm the one who volunteered ... So , is it not allowed ? Cutting right to the chase . No , that 's not what ... I 'm not done talking ! Listen until I 'm done ! Hey , hey ... We 're not saying no . We just wanted to get the third year reps ' opinions first . Getting straight to the point , well ? What do you think , third year reps ? Room B. I think that 's fine . I was talking about it earlier with the others . I think it 's best to let the person who wants to do it , do it . Second A ! But , um ... I 'm not trying to put down the person from second year class C , but how about the other third years ? How do the people from the sports clubs feel about it ? The athletic festival is where the people from the sports clubs get to show off . How will they feel about having a transfer student as the ... That 's right ! In other words , is it all right to make this kind of a decision without everyone here ? Let me remind everyone that the volunteer from second year class C is a transfer student that hasn 't been here very long . Of course he 's not used to our school yet ! He 's still practically a guest . I understand his enthusiasm , but what can we do ? Hold it right there ! They 're here . The Judo Club supports it ! The Kendo Club supports it ! So does the Baseball Club ! We all support it ! Thanks to an informant , we sports clubs have come to stop the student government 's tyranny ! Tyranny ? Yeah ! Yeah ! What ! ? The Sport Clubs raided in ? Yeah . Apparently all the sports clubs are trying to make Muryou Subaru the Cheer Captain of the White Team . Subaru ! Moriguchi ! Was that good ? Yes , thanks ! Are you scheming something ? You 're so sly . We are protesting against the tyranny of the student government that 's monopolizing Misumaru Middle School , and its spirit of freedom and independence ! That is a false accusation ! We have seen Muryou Subaru 's unparalleled athletic abilities with our own eyes and we are in absolute awe ! This man was born for the Athletic Festival ! I 'm almost certain about that ! But , the student government is ignoring Muryou 's willingness to volunteer as the Cheer Captain , and ... We are not ignoring it ! M ... meaning , we and the other students in the athletic council fully endorse and support Muryou Subaru 's appointment as the Cheer Captain . That 's it . Yes , exactly . Are you sure ? Absolutely ! Then ... Wait a second , Hachiyou ! There 's no need to wait ! Kyoichi ! Aren 't you supposed to be doing your own work ? Muryou Subaru ! If you 're going to be the White Team Cheer Captain ... Then what ? Then I 'm going to volunteer as the Red Team Cheer Captain ! W ... wait , where did that come from ? I 'm going to crush you in the cavalry battle at the end ! Okay , everyone ! That 's decided , so ... First Athletic Festival Representatives Meeting Captains Decided White : Muryou Subaru Red : Kyoichi Moriguchi Hi ! I 'm coming in ! This is great ! This is awesome ! The Showdown Mood is an A + ! Ehem ! A comment about this year 's Athletic Festival , please . I think it 's gonna be White . It 's going to be Red ! Good luck ! Thanks . Congratulations ! Thanks . Just you wait , Subaru ! Wha ... How did this happen ? Wha ... How did this happen ? As the turbulent meeting was taking place at school I was also being faced with a turbulent moment of my own . You 're Hajime Murata ? Yes . Is it true that you saw the secret of Shingu ? Shingu ? The white giant . When you say secret ... Do you mean the part where Moriyama transforms into that Shingu thing ? What did you think ? What did I think ? What did you think when you saw Nayuta turn into a monster ? Oh ! I was surprised . But ... But ? I just thought , " Oh , that 's so fitting for her . " So fitting ? Yes ... That 's what came to mind . What did you think when you saw Kyoichi use his power ? I thought , " Just who are these guys ? " Oh , Muryou was also using his power , so that 's why it 's plural . I guess it 's strange . Normally I think people would panic and yell " Oh my God ! " , but I was thinking something else ... Something else ? I want to know more . I want to learn more about Muryou ... About Moriyama ... And about this town ... Why ? Why ? I think it 's because I like everyone . Thank you , everyone . Please leave the rest to me . As you wish . Are you that worried about Murata ? Or is it me ? You are so self-involved . I hate you ! You 're right ! I 'm worried about Murata ! Hmm ... Hey ! I didn 't mean it like that ! Sanemori No can do ! I can 't let you see Hajime . Why not ? She 's worried about Murata . She feels responsible because she 's the one that did all those horrible things to him . Like attacking him in the middle of the night , and on the roof ... Will you ... ! Now , now ... Hajime is in the middle of something important . He 's getting the incantation you received when you were a child . B ... but we don 't do that to outsiders ! He 'll be fine . Come , come . Why don 't we go have tea at the outer building ? I brought some really good manju . I really could care less , but why have you been here since yesterday , sis ? No way ! She 's your sister ! ? This is the first time we will be doing this in our long two-thousand year history . But , it was foretold that this day would come , by an ancestor long ago . The evolution of humans ... The expansion of the realm in which humans live ... When people become aware of how close the universe is humans will climb to further heights . Let me tell you the history of the universe ... The history of how the Galactic Federation State came to be ... And the history of the people of Tenmo ; how we , the Guardians , came to be ... This solar system was an unknown realm to our ancestors . Every planet competed to send their explorer ships out first to find the new Star Road . It happened a long , long time ago . Put your hand against mine . This is kind of embarrassing . Close your eyes . Submit your heart to me . Hajime is late . He said he 'd be at his friend 's house . The transfer student 's ! Damn it ! Damn it ! Damn it ! Nayuta . Come on , tell me . Who do you like ? Muryou ? Hajime ? Or ... or ... Is it ... ? Ew ! She stinks like alcohol ! Do something about her ! Are you listening to me ? Nayuta ... Ew ! She stinks like alcohol ! Do something about her ! Are you listening to me ? Ew ! She stinks like alcohol ! Do something about her ! Are you listening to me ? Various people spend their nights in their own way , and wake up to various different tomorrows . I wonder what kind of tomorrow I 'll be having ? To be continued in the next episode ! To Be Continued Next Episode How is everyone doing ? I 'm Futaba Murata . Lately it seems like all my brother talks about at home is Muryou Subaru . Apparently he wears a school uniform , and lives all by himself in a place that looks like a tea ceremony room . I wonder what kind of person he is ? Next Episode of Record of the School Wars : Muryou ! Gazing Ey es " Gazing Eyes ! " Look forward to it ! Gazing Eyes

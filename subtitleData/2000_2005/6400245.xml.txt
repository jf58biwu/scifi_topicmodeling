 One , two ! One , two , three ! Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show ? He oughta be , with all the strict training I 've been putting him through . Nibbler , roll over , and you get a ham . Roll over . Roll over for the ham . You are so adorable . Who wants a ham ? Zooka barooka ! First prize is $ 500 and a year 's supply of dog food ! Five hundred dollars , you say ? Dog food , you say ? Man , that dog 's gonna be hard to beat . Look at him bring in the sheep . - One sheep , two sheep ... - Three sheep . The dog 's good . But our real competition is the hypno-toad . Your turn , Nibbler honey . Herd those sheep ! Come on , Nibbler ! Ma 'am , I have a late entry . My hard-shelled whooping terrier , Mr. Zoidberg . Faster ! Faster ! Oh ! Ow . Suck in that gut ! You want to be spayed ? Ahh . Silence , you cur ! Puff out that brisket . # # I should be weeping ! I 'm not weeping ! I love these things ! Shake paws , Nibbler . Come on . Shake . He might be a little hungry . Shake , boy ! Usually he 's had more ham by now . Shake ! Third prize , a party-sized keg of guinea pigs ... goes to Dave Spiegel ... and his owner , Fluffers . Second prize , this lovely afghan made from an Afghan ... goes to Bender and his whooping terrier ! Second place ? That 's a fancy word for losing ! You ... didn 't ... stick your landing ! - Forgive me , my friend . - Never ! And before we announce the winner ... we have a special award for a first-time contestant ... Ms. Leela and her mystery pet , Nibbler . Me ? Award ? Him ? Me ? Good ? That 's just the kind of eloquence you 'd expect from the owner of ... Dumbest Pet in Show ! And the grand-prize winner ... The hypno-toad . All glory to the hypno-toad . Maybe they 're right . Maybe Nibbler is dumb . Don 't listen to them ! People said I was dumb , but I proved them . Good news , everyone ! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 ... but it 's been completely destroyed . - Why is that good news ? - They paid in advance . Excuse me . This is mighty strange . First the civilization of Space Rome collapsed ... then Don Martin III went kerflooey ... and now Tweenis 12 . - Looks like this planet is next in line . - That 's Earth . - The planet we live on ? - I 'd hate to be those guys . - Ooh ! - What 's got into him ? He 's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word " food . " What now ? No ! Nibbler , come back ! Too bad Nibbler 's not around . I guess I 'll have to eat this raw , dripping ham by myself . Nibbler ? Nibbler , you 're scaring me . Nibbler ! Am I going crazy ? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me ? Nibbler , help ! Don 't leave me here ! Uh , Nibbler , could you scooch the seat upjust a little bit ? - Leela back yet ? - Fry , help me ! My heart stopped beating ! - You don 't have a heart . You 're a robot . - Sure . Right . Robot . Oh , Fry , my skin 's all dry and clanky ! Well , yeah . Robots are made of metal . Am I a robot ? If this is some kind of scam , I don 't get it . You already have my power of attorney . Fry ! My skin ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! I 'm a genius . Ow ! Ow ! Dr. Zoidberg , why is everyone acting so weird ? Zoidbee want balloon . Want balloon now ! Zoidbee want go outside ! Ah , I just let you back in ! This is unbelievable . I thought you were a furry little moron , but here you are flying an adorable spaceship . If only you could talk . Wait ! I understood that . You say you 're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain ? Yeah . You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid ? Oh ! Stupider . And you go on to say that we 're headed for your home planet ... where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe ? So , how did the universe begin ? Then the meaning of existence ... So every religion is wrong ! You fell . Hi ! Today some bad things happened . One bad thing was a train got crashed in New Jersey . Want to see ? People won 't be late for work , though , because the governor lady said ... " I 'm sending in more trains . " Wait for me ! Morbo can 't understand his teleprompter . He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat . It 's a " T. " It goes " tuh . " Hello , little man . I will destroy you ! Man , even the newsmonster is acting strange . - What are we gonna do ? - Duh . I know ! - Let 's play the lottery ! - No ! Let 's buy Internet stock . On margin ! Zoidbee wanna buy on margin . Look at me ! I 'm invisible . Wait a minute . I know what 's going on here . You 've all become idiots ! Hey , let 's all join the Reform Party ! Oh , yeah ! Welcome back , Lord Nibbler , Ambassador to Earth , home world of the pizza bagel . Thank you . I bear many receipts for reimbursement . The four welcomes a friendship to you as well , Leela . We shall manipulate your mind , so we appear to be speaking your language . - Do not be afraid , my child . - I 'm not afraid . Uh , good . Good . So your real name is Lord Nibbler ? That 's a coincidence . That name is for your sake . In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name ... a trillion cosmoses would flare into existence and sink into eternal night . Oh , you 're all so cute ! No , we 're not . We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race . Behold ... When the universe was forged in the crucible of the big bang ... our mighty race was already 17 years old . Aww ! For the first millisecond of time , things were okay ... but then there arose a terrible enemy ... the Brain Spawn . Ever since , we have waged unceasing war ... against these dreadful ... - Lunch is ready . - Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin ! So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth , Nibbler ? The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness . The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs ... of a billion art-house movie patrons . Thus they travel from world to world , making everyone stupid ... in order to wipe out all thought in the universe . Wipe out all thought ? My God ! They 're like flying televisions ! And even we are powerless to stop them ... fearsome though we are . There is but one being who can resist them ... a child of destiny whose bizarre brain-wave pattern ... makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack . He is the hope of the universe . The fate of your world ... perhaps all worlds ... rests in his special mind . Now , when you say " special ... " Attention , New New Yorkers ! Stop acting so stupid ! Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of Moron Zone , formerly known as Earth . Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains ? Because he doesn 't shower ? The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave . Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave ... as do certain trees . Fry , however , does not . Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves ... into a working mind . Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants . Yes , like your prom dress . The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant , evil brain ... with a gooey center of pure hate . Only Fry , with his superior yet inferior mind , can approach it . You must tell him to disable it . We will do the rest . - You can count on me . - No , we can 't . Once on Earth , you will be too stupid to remember the message . That 's why we wrote it down for you . We 've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens . Time to reeducate you dunce bags . We 'll start with U.S. Presidents . This was our first president , George Washington . Let 's review . Who was our first president ? Um ... - A pickle jar ? - Thomas Jefferson ? Leela ! I 've been so worried ! Are you a bonehead ? I have to tell ... must ... important ... something . Whoa , whoa . Slow down . You 're going a mile a minute . This ! You for this . Thanks ! No ! Ow ! Fire hot ! The professie will help . Fire indeed hot ! Oh ! Chester A. Arthur fall down . Brain ! Brain make people dumb . No , Leela . Brain make people smart . You go fight biggest brain of all . Even bigger than those ? Holy nuts ! Where is it ? - I don 't know . - Hmm . A giant brain is basically a giant nerd ... and where would a giant nerd be ? The library ! Pathetic human race . Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb . Dewey , you fool ! Your decimal system has played right into my hands . - What do you want ? - I 'm here to kick your ass ! Wishful thinking . We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses . Odd . My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think . That 's right ! I think you 'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing ! Okay . Better think of a new plan . Come on , Fry . Think . Thinking . Thinking . Stop that ! Hey , thinking hurts him . Maybe I can think of a way to use that . Aha ! Prepare to be thought at ! - Leela , give me a topic . - Duh ! Seriously . I can 't think of anything . I gotta find something to make me think . Hardy Boys . Too easy . Nancy Drew . Too hard . Ah ! Perfect . Bonfire of the Vanities ! No ! It 's unbearable ! The brains are weakening . Nibblonians to Nibble stations . Prepare Cuddle Bug for deployment in 40 nibblets . Sometimes I fear we are cute . Oh , niggle-snoosh ! Take that ! And that ! This sentence I don 't understand , but take this one ! You have not won yet . Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm ... and I shall take you there and imprison you forever ! Icky ! Where are we ? A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale . - Big whale over there ! - Arr ! I saw it first . Wait ! That no white whale . It gray thinkie whale . Queequeg , let go of me . I have to kill it ! Farewell ! You will all be trapped in this dense symbolist tome ... forever ! - Huh ? - Follow him ! It 's our only way out . Excuse me . Have you seen a giant brain ? Yep . I let him help me whitewash Aunt Polly 's fence . Tom Sawyer , you tricked me . This is less fun than previously indicated . Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity . - Please , no ! - Come on ! Mr. Fry , Mama tells us you 're quite the oddity . A bachelor at your age . You think I 'm an oddity ? Wait till you see ... Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hartfordshire ... Mr. Brainley . I 'm a gigantic brain ! - I say ! - Most ungentleman-like ! Mr. Brainley , what news have you of the London season ? - Well ... - Hey , brainey ! Think fast ! I always think fast . The whale ... he be white now ! Ow ! Leela , I 've got an idea . Stay here with Queequeg . Is there Mrs. Queequeg ? I 'm free ! All right , brain ! Get ready for some electroshock treatment ! Fry , don 't die ! Wake up ! No ! Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase . The big brain laughed in triumph . Ha-ha-ha ! Then , for no reason , he left Earth forever . The end . There ! Now he 's trapped in a book I wrote ... a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors . The big brain am winning again ! I am the " greetest " ! Now I am leaving Earth for no raisin ! The big brain is defeated . Let what must be done be done . Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties . I did it ! And it 's all thanks to the books at my local library . And so life returned to normal ... or as normal as it gets on this primitive dirt ball ... inhabited by psychotic apes . Thanks to the effect of the brain rays ... The people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired ... except Fry , and no one believed him or cared what he had to say . I , meanwhile , returned to my post ... ever vigilant , lest Earth again come under brain attack . And when that day comes , God help us . God help us all . Time for a diapie change ! End transmission .

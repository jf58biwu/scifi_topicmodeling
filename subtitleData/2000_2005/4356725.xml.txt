You want die like last men visit Amazonia ? - What did they die of ? - Crushed pelvises . - Yes ! - Thank you , Lord in heaven ! FEM-PUTER : After lengthy fem-putations , I have decided the fate of the men . Fem-puter sentences them to death by snu-snu ! - Yeah ! What are you , gay ? Death to the men ! Death by snu-snu ! - But the snu-snu part will be good . - Baby , it 'll blow your mind . Be reasonable . Sure , men are annoying , and they wreck their planets . But these men are sort of my friends . They don 't deserve to die . Hm . Perhaps men are not as evil as Fem-puter thinks . They make fun women 's basketball . What ? ! Did you explain how good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk ? - Yes . They still laugh . - The men must die ! - Too true , Fem-puter . You 're so wise . Kill ' em all . Good riddance .

And Kif , as the most attractive male will be snu-snu 'd by the most beautiful women of Amazonia . Then the large women . Then the petite women . Then the large women again . Initiate snu-snu ! Before I die , I have to tell you I didn 't mean to say those awful things . - They were all Zapp 's idea . - Really ? Honest and true ? Yes . And that person calling and hanging up was me . I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you ! Oh , Kif ! It Og 's first time . Be gentle ! We 've got to do something . You can interface with the fem-puter and reprogram it .

I disguised myself so I could rule the Amazonians . - But why ? - Why ? Why ? I came here from a faraway planet . A planet ruled by a chauvinistic man-puter that was really a manbot . Have you any idea how it feels to be a fembot in a manbot 's man-puter 's world ? - What ? And now , meddling manbot , there 's the question of what to do with you .

[ MOANING ] BENDER : Come on , give me some of that . That 's how I got my new shell . It looks just like the one I threw out . I found it in the same dumpster , but this one had a live raccoon in it . Pretty good story , eh ? Stick to someone else , you windy barnacle ! The battle of the sexes was only resolved when a manbot and a fembot realized they loved each other . Yeah . By the way , if she calls , I 'm not here . All I know is , this gold says that was the best mission ever . - It sure was . - Oh , yeah . I had snu-snu . So , Amy ? What do you want to do now ? [ WHISPERS ]

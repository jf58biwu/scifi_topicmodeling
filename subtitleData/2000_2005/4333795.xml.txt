 We lost him . You think we lost him ? I do . Come on . We 're free . Come on . We 're both human . Hey . Great work . Congratulations . Drack on the attack . I 'll say I was a little surprised ... when you weren 't back by lunch , though . The big guy got away . I 'm sorry to hear that . Looks like the morning wasn 't a complete waste , though . Put him in the decontamination chamber . Another thaw incinerated ... and our preemptive strike is one step closer to success . Drack , for agents who go one-on-one with thaws ... a decontamination injection is mandatory . It won 't hurt much . And you know the risk if you don 't . I hate needles . They 're for the protection of the entire bureau , not to mention your own . I 'll take my chances with the bugs . I 'll be chasing down the big guy that got away . While you 're at it , sniff this one out , too . Another thaw ? At least tell me you got some ID on this one . No , but why don 't you start at the cryopads lair ? Livers , spleens , leg bones and ribs , the occasional brain . What exactly were you in the market for ? Word has it you thaw deep freezes here . Who told you that ? I 'm with the Bureau of Health , and I 'll ask the questions . Listen , I don 't need any trouble with the Bureau of Health . I run a clean lab . I 'm looking for a couple of thaws defrosted a while back , maybe in this lab . I told you . We don 't do thaws here . Although I could be persuaded ... to point you in the right direction . What do you know ? You didn 't land on your feet . Unless you want to lose that skin of yours for good , you 'd better back off . I 'll take a look . Maybe we 'll be lucky . Your luck , not mine . Nothing on the male thaw . But I have a hit on the female . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover ... there 's no place like home .

Thaws are almost impossible to trace . They don 't fit in . No family . No - Friends . Don 't I know it ? Let me look . You transplanted a kidney the same day this woman was thawed . Maybe the transplant has a clue to this thaw 's whereabouts . They were the ones . You 're right . This thaw left with the kidney woman , but not before a Betrayer blew in ... and destroyed half my lab . A Betrayer ? The plot thickens . Let 's see coverage of the firefight . The best-looking ones are always the deadliest . Which one got the kidney ? Really , I-I can 't remember . Humans all look alike ... The shorter one . With the light fur . These two women who sprung the thaw , how did they afford a transplant ? This isn 't a charity lab . How did they pay ? Wood . It 's made of wood . Who are these guys ? I don 't like it . Team leaders don 't just vanish into thin air . Marcus isn 't some wallflower tiptoeing around . He walks into a room and people remember it . Somebody 's bound to know what happened . Marcus ' last Voice communication was 48 hours ago . After that , nothing . What about the tracer in his gauntlets ? The signal went dead shortly after his last communication . It 's dead . Maybe he 's on vacation . You know , hanging out with some old buddies we don 't know about . Cleo 's got a point . We don 't know who Marcus ran with before he became a team leader . Or who he might have crossed . I 've traced the coordinates of his last communication with Voice . Then we start there . Work our way backwards . Retrace Marcus ' steps . There 's a shaft club not far from there . Somebody might have seen something . Oh , I 'm on it . I did this investigative piece ... for my old school paper about locker theft . Blew the case wide open . Yeah . Put on the right dress , the right attitude , I 'll get the answers . It 's Drack . Afternoon , sunshine . Any leads on the female thaw ? She was defrosted by a couple of her friends . Thaws don 't come into this world with friends . You know that . This one did . One of them picked up a fresh kidney . I 've been trying to run its serial number . Half the population is sporting spare parts . If I was you , I 'd hit for the upper level bars . Thaws always run for the surface . When they realize they can 't get out , they start drowning their sorrows . Ever wonder why you 're working the desk and I 'm in the field ? Meaning ? Meaning I got a feeling about this one . Drack 's following his nose . I wouldn 't work too hard . Something tells me this one 's no different from any other thaw . Funny . Something tells me she is . This must be it . No blast points . No sign of laser fire . Voice , sure this is where communication was lost ? Yeah , this is where Marcus last contacted her . Was there any distress signal ? Nothing . Some team leaders prefer to tackle problems without my assistance . Marcus was one of them . Voice thinks that Marcus tried to handle this one on his own . Sarge . What is it ? There 's something in here . There it is . One of Marcus' old-school projectiles . I think it 's time to check up on Cleo . Marcus was here till midnight about three days ago . He was supposed to meet a big guy about Betrayer information . Somebody must have followed him out . How do you find all this out ? I pour myself into this dress and the boys start pouring out their hearts . You know the gun Marcus used to carry around ? Looks like he got off a couple of shots at the guys who jumped him . So Marcus was packing heat , huh ? How does this help us find him ? No one 's used projectiles like that in 300 years . They don 't look that old . It 's brand new . Titanium alloy mined from Level 57 . I 'm thinking whoever made those for Marcus , just might know what he was up to . Mmm . All right . You guys get on that lead and I 'll just stick to this one . You 're , um , you 're up next , aren 't you ? To fit in . So the stoolies will trust me . Just be careful . This thing with Marcus is smelling worse and worse . Careful ? Nothing bad happens at a karaoke bar . Hey , sweetheart , those your original organs ? " I get no kick from champagne " " Mere alcohol doesn 't thrill me at all " " So tell me why should it be true " " That I get a kick out of you ? " " Some like the perfume from Spain " " I 'm sure that if I took even one sniff " " It would bore me terrifically too " " Yet I get a kick out of you " " I get a kick " " Every time I see you " " Standing there before me " " I get a kick " " Though it 's clear to me " " You obviously do not adore me " " I get no kick in a plane " " Flying too high with some guy " " In the sky is my idea " " Of nothing to do " " Yet I get a kick " " You give me the boot " " I get a kick out of you " Bullets . They 're called bullets . Yeah . Funny how no one seems to know how ... we can get our hands on these anymore . Why should I be any different ? Because you whipped this batch up for our friend Marcus . Marcus ? Yeah , he 's disappeared . We thought you might know where your best customer went . You 're looking down the wrong shaft , sister . You know , you 're lucky you survived ... that flash fire in your workshop a year back . Almost took out an entire level . Yeah . I heard that it was caused by some kind of explosive propellant . Do you mean gunpowder ? No way . Not here . Mmm . He 's probably right . That stuff 's been outlawed since pre-Bailey days . Oh , yeah . Of course , if it did come out that this fire was caused by ... " illegal gunpowder " ... Listen , sister , I was cleared of that fire . Would you still want to keep it that way ? I haven 't seen Marcus for a while . Long time . And then yesterday his weapons show up . Quite an eclectic arsenal . His weapons ? Listen , I 'm no fence . I just pointed him in the right direction . Pointed him to who ? It 's coming to the best part . See who it is and send them away . What 's going on out there ? Uh-oh . Nice to see you again , Sluggo . Please be gentle . I 've only had this arm re-attached ... for a few weeks . It 's still tender . We 're not here for you , Sluggo . We 're looking for something in this pigsty of yours . And a few answers . Answers , I haven 't got . But anything else , you can have at cost . We want to know how you got your sticky little fingers on a pair of gauntlets . Me ? I haven 't got any ... We know they 're here , Sluggo . Why don 't you just make it easy on yourself ? There 's one there . I wasn 't sure that they weren 't stolen . They were removed from their wearer ... after a quiet and honorable death . They 're Marcus ' . Sarge . Check this out . How rare is that ? Can 't be aged more than a few months . A man who buys a lady a drink . How rare is that ? You have a lovely voice . And that song you sang ? Pretty . My name is Drack . Hmm . Drack . That 's a name you can get your legs around . I 'm Cleo . Thanks for the cocktail , Drack . My pleasure . So , do you work here at the club ? Their regular singer ? Actually , I 'm-I 'm here on business . So am I. To tell you the truth , I 'm looking for a guy . I 'd say you found one . Mmm . And then some . Unfortunately , you 're not the one I was hoping to find . Hmm . Too bad . You 're exactly who I was looking for . Really ? Honest . You don 't happen to know a guy named Marcus ? Big . Tough , like you . Maybe he was a friend . In my line of work , I don 't make many friends . The way I look at it , anybody who isn 't an enemy is a friend . Which makes us ? I think I 'd remember if we were enemies . Drack ? You okay ? Hey ! No ! Drack . Get out of here . Just go . I 'll handle this . There he is . My favorite agent . Back at the top of his game . I said I hate needles . Really , Drack , you should take your medicine . Nice work , though . Only one mark left . The female . Got any leads ? Nope . What 's so important about this mark anyway ? You got any proof she 's contaminated ? Proof ? Since when do I need proof ? She 's a thaw . You hunt thaws . End of story . What the hell 's gotten into you ? So I 'm doing my tough-chick talk , you know , and Drack 's totally buying it . Drack , huh ? You like him , don 't you ? I , eh , I was on the clock . I - I was - I was working . Mmm-hmm . So what does this Drack look like ? Well , he 's tall and , you know , muscley , but not over-pumped . He 's got really nice shoulders . Strong hands . And he 's got these really deep eyes that , you know , when they look at you , they really look at you . Yeah , he was cute . Can we go back to the part where ... the men in the uniform showed up , please ? Yeah , you know , so , I - I 'm just about to get some answers ... out of Drack , and-and all of a sudden this WWF wannabe bulldozes him . You know , and so I conked that big guy out .. and then the next thing I know , these guys come in and wheeled him away . I , uh ... They had some patches on their sleeves , like the boy scouts ... Er , BNN or BNA or ... BH . Bureau of Health . Yeah . Drack sees them and tells me to run for it . Yeah , for good reason . Years ago , a plague wiped out a huge chunk of the population down here . The few important people that were left created the Bureau of Health , so that it could never happen again . But they went too far . Anyone with a runny nose was locked away under quarantine . There hasn 't been an epidemic in over 50 years , so they sort of faded away . No one really knows what they 've been up to since . So this friend of yours , Drack . Bureau guys take him away , too ? No . He just talked to them and left . So , the B of H is definitely involved somehow . What do those creeps want now ? Well , whatever it is , I 'll get it out of Drack . But I 've got to change first . Hi . Well , hello there . I hardly recognized you . I bought you a drink and you saved my skin . Not a very fair trade . It was a really good drink . Well , hopefully , this one won 't be interrupted . I 'm glad you 're okay . I 'm glad you 're okay , too . Let 's be okay as long as we can in this wacky world . Deal ? Deal . At first I couldn 't even get near the edge without getting sick . Then my friends taught me how to fly the shafts . They sound pretty special . Your friends . They are . Anyone else special in your life ? Isn 't it a little late for you to be asking if I have a boyfriend ? Well , do you ? I did . A long time ago . Do you have anyone ? I had a partner . She got sick . Nothing I could do . I 'm sorry . So , you said you were here on business . What exactly is your job description ? I try to help as many people as I can , without hurting too many people doing it . That 's sort of what I do . Really ? In my line of work , I don 't have much time for talking . I hope I 'm keeping up okay . You 're doing wonderfully . There is enough trace DNA on the grip to confirm it belonged to Marcus . Well . No surprises there . Who else would carry a relic like this ? It 's so heavy . And inaccurate . Marcus did say he 'd had it for a long time . Interesting . These lenses provide no protection against gauntlet fire ... or neural distortion fields . Maybe he just liked the way they looked . " I could have danced all night " " I could have pranced all night " . Oh . Guess what , guys . I think I 'm in love . Security breach ! It 's a bug . Looks like your new boyfriend sent you home ... with something more than a song to sing . I could have picked that up anywhere . I - In that club anybody could have clipped that on me . Really . Cleo , how many people did you talk to about Marcus ? I don 't know . Um , 20 or 22 . Yeah , any one of them . How many bought you a drink ? Tickled your chin ? Maybe gave you a good-bye hug ? One . I knew something smelled ... when your smooth talker wasn 't taken away by the B of H boys . He 's Bureau . No . He 's just likes keeping tabs on a girl he likes . Like a stalker , only nicer . Cleo . Your friend knows more than he 's letting on . And it 's time we find out just how much . Hi . We keep running into each other , don 't we ? It 's fate at work , I guess . Or this ? Uh , uh , uh . Do you always come armed to a romantic rendezvous ? Yeah , what 's this all about ? You 're no different than any other man this past 500 years . I 'm sorry , Cleo . I was doing my job . Was it part of your job to make me trust you ? Did you also lie about Marcus ? I don 't know anybody called Marcus . Voice ? We have a Bureau of Health agent ... who 's overstepped his jurisdiction . Any recommendations ? I 'd like to know why the Bureau ... has agents in the field ... with no evidence of an outbreak . So would I. " Voice , " did you say ? I never believed Voice teams really existed . I thought they were just stories , myths . This myth is about to send you flying . You two are lucky you 're not dead . My Bureau figures that sooner or later ... a thaw like Cleo would let loose a 22st century epidemic . So that 's what the Bureau of Health 's been up to these days ? You 're going after people who were cryogenically frozen . You don 't have to worry about me . I 've already had everything . Uh , mumps , measles ... The chicken pox torpedoed my junior prom . The pox ? You survived the chicken pox ? Far as I know , everybody did . Well , maybe in your day . People were inoculated against diseases then . But since the Bureau wiped out ... the last flu virus 50 years ago , no one has seen anything of these diseases . We have no natural immunity against them . So killing every possible carrier is the answer ? I watched my partner waste away ... because of something some thaw brought into this world . Is that all I am to you ? A thaw ? Some kind of " Typhoid " Cleo ? No , but you carry the pox . You said so yourself . And we 're all still fine . Cleo 's no danger to anyone . Hel , those diseases Cleo had must be dormant in her system . Drack , if Cleo is carrying these immunities in her system , then maybe we can distil them somehow . Use them to help fight against diseases now . Maybe . Look , no one in the Underworld has a better lab than the Bureau . Mauser does , and he can isolate Cleo 's immunities faster than anyone . Let 's go . Um , can we catch up to you guys ? Cleo . Please . I 'll be okay . As long as we can keep tabs on you . Yes , mother . Be back before midnight . Chaperones . Man , this just keeps getting better . Psst . You looking for Marcus ? Easy . I might be able to help you out . What do you know about Marcus ? You want to know where he went ? I can send you there . Sarge , watch it ! Get down , Hel ! You okay ? Yeah . You know this guy ? No . No ID . Sarge . Look at these needle marks . You really are just trying to help people , aren 't you ? Well , that 's what I used to think , at least . So I hardened . I stopped seeing people in my sights and only saw carriers , like the one that infected my partner . It 's hard to lose somebody . You lost everyone and you didn 't harden . People down here live like they 're already dead . And you have as much reason to as any one of them . When I met you , I knew that the Bureau was wrong . Someone like you could never hurt anyone . I just thought you liked my singing . Ah , excuse me . Run ! No ! So obviously this Drack character ... doesn 't mind going after older women . Cleo 's got 500 years on the guy . And so have the diseases he 's worried about . And so does Marcus ' gun . Wait a minute . Sarge , what if Marcus' disappearance ... has nothing to do with his being a team leader ? What do you mean ? Those goons that jumped us , they had guns just like this . And those marks on their arm , they could have been from decon shots . Which means they 're Bureau , just like Drack . So , if the Bureau is hunting thaws , and Marcus ' gun is as old as Cleo 's ... Then Marcus is a thaw , just like Cleo . Wait a minute . Cleo 's stopped moving . Maybe she ditched that bug . Oh , no . Let 's go . Why don 't you get it over with ? Go ahead and kill me . Or I could leave town by sundown . You know , take a long vacation . Personally , I prefer door number two . Are you negotiating ? Wait . Tooley . She 's not the problem . She 's the cure . Cleo already has immunities in her system . It 's everything you need to prevent an epidemic . And if one thaw has the immunities , then ... Then you don 't have to kill me ... or anyone else like me . I never intended to kill you . But this is a lab . Where 's the - Incinerator ? There is no incinerator , sunshine . Okay . So , you 're not gonna kill me , and-and I 'll give you the nuts and bolts for a vaccine . There won 't be an epidemic . Oh , there 'll be an epidemic . I 'll see to that . What tells me that that isn 't a thermos of chicken soup ? A plague distilled from dormant diseases , rampaging through bodies of thaws just like you . You 're manufacturing an epidemic ? And its vaccine . You see , we can 't allow for any competition . That would get in the way of my margin . Marcus . They 're all still alive . Let me guess . That one 's for me . Smart . Hel , Cleo 's coordinates are the Bureau of Health 's offices themselves . Already on our way . I should tell you , I really hate needles . Don 't move , pal , or I 'll pump your compadre all full of ... sterile water . Plan B. Go . Get out of here . No , not without ... Go . What ? What is it ? They 're moving again . Fast . I don 't know if it 's Drack or Cleo or - That 's all we got to go on . Evening , sunshine , where 's the fire ? Any idea where she might have gone ? You think I 'd tell you if I did ? You 're a damn good agent , Drack . Too good not to have tagged your mark with a tracer . " I get a kick " " Every time I see you " " Standing there " " Before me " Nice finish to all of this , don 't you think ? Hi . I don 't get it . You dedicate your life to stopping epidemics . Well , health is still my primary concern . My own , however , takes precedence . Now , if you 'd give me the canister . Give me Drack . But I really don 't think you 're in a position to negotiate . There are six of us and one of you . Count again . It 's a quarantine shield . Effectively keeps germs and toxins at bay . Energy blasts , too . Now , I 'm going to say this one more time . Give me the canister . If you want it so bad , why don 't you see how well your vaccine works ? No ! No . Drack . Drack . Here 's a blast from the past . I 've never seen anything like that before . We should have no problem synthesizing ... a vaccine from Cleo 's immunities . Congratulations , Cleo . You just saved the Underworld . Again ? Not that I like repaying favors , but I owe your team one . Just one , though . For all three . You 're welcome . Hel , I hope you don 't mind , but I authorized a visitor . I see security hasn 't tightened up much around here . You 're okay . Of course I am . We had a deal , remember ? So , what about Tooley ? Tooley 's alive , but he 's due to face trial . It 's in the court 's hands now . All the thaws are out of danger , thanks to the three of you . I understand you gave this up to help your friend . I thought you might like it back . Thank you . So what now ? You ride off into the sunset ? If you 're coming with me . You know how hard it is to make friends down here . I guess I was pretty lucky to be found by the right people . This is where I belong . I understand . Where do you think you 're going ? " I get no kick " " In a plane " " Flying too high with some guy " " In the sky " " Is my idea " " Of nothing to do " " Yet I get a kick " " You give me the boot " " I get a kick " " Out of you " Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

 Previously on Taken ... What do you want from me ? ! Leave my family alone ! You really do need to see someone . There is something in my head . I think the things are tracking devices . - Dad ? - He isn 't me , Charlie . He 's making me from the picture in your head . They 'll come for Charlie next . You gotta go . Charlie , we 're gonna move around for a while . Is this because of what happened to dad ? - What are these ? - Tom Clarke . The Tom Clarke who ruined my father , who thought our entire program was a lie . Kind of ironic , Jake . The country 's leading debunker turns out to have a half-alien half brother . Don 't you want to know what changed his mind ? You 're sleeping with Eric Crawford , Owen Crawford 's son , the son of the man who ruined your mother 's life . How could you do that ? ! He 's not his father . He 's covering up the biggest secret in American history , he 's lying to the public on a regular basis ... What in the hell makes you think that he 's not lying to you ? ! We believe you 're carrying the evidence of a spacecraft that crashed in the New Mexico desert in 1947 . What kind of evidence ? We believe you recovered bodies and that you 're transporting them . You and your friends here will be detained for interfering with a move of Air Force personnel . Look ! Look ! How long you think you can cover something like this up ? The crates . Get these people onto the trucks . - Do it now ! - Yes , sir . - Step up . - Let 's go . All right , everybody into the trucks ! Move it ! This way ! This way , please . Let 's go . That 's it , move it up . What are you gonna do with all these witnesses ? Hold them for 72 hours , convince them what they saw was the Goodyear blimp . They 're not gonna believe that . They 're gonna talk about this . Let them . The more people talk at once , The more it sounds like nothing but noise . They took your bodies , too , didn 't they ? Now what are you gonna do now they 've taken back all your proof ? It didn 't have to be this way . How could it have been any different ? It 's all gone . You gotta love it . We must have been getting close . Why do you say that ? Remember I said I thought they had an organic transmitter ? I think it was one of the bodies . We missed that . It was right in front of us , and we missed it . They couldn 't afford to have us figure it out , so they just ... Took it all back . Every last bit of it . Not quite everything . Well , as expected , they pulled our plug . What are they going to do ? All our evidence , all our research is gone . I thought I made a pretty good argument . " Senator , " I said , " the reason we have nothing to show you " is that it was plucked from our slimy little hands " by a flying saucer . You can 't deny that . Right out of the sky , and pluck . " Too bad we couldn 't find Charlie Keys . You know what burns my ass ? I 'll tell you what burns my ass . If we 'd gotten any funding at all , I could have gotten that positioning system running . We could have tracked Keys by that thing in his head and found him or anyone else taken in 24 hours . What are you going to do now ? Couple of buddies of mine from Yale are going into biotech . How about you ? I just keep picturing Tom Clarke smiling that smug smile of his and saying , " Still don 't know how it flies , do you ? " What you keep picturing is his sister dumping you . I still want to know what made Tom Clarke a believer . You could have had your answer , but you thought with " little Eric . " " Hey , little buddy , where do you want to go ? " " Over to Becky 's house . " " Okay . " " Hey , let 's take her to see the alien . " " Good idea . That 'll really impress her . " My own personal foibles aside , I still want the answer to that . I want to know what changed his mind . Is every moment of our lives built into us before we 're born ? If it is. does that make us less responsible for the things we do . Or is the responsibility built in. too ? After you hit the ball. do you stand and wait to see if it goes out . Or do you start running and let nature take its course ? If that ball had been another couple of inches , it would have gone out of the park , end of story . I swung too late . I thought it was gonna sink . That 's why I like baseball ... You can 't make assumptions . I thought you liked it because it was impossibly hard and there are useless statistics you could memorize . Yeah , that , too . Ohh ... Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'll be fine . We 'd better get home . This was your grandmother 's . Love you , sweetie . Every day and twice on Sundays . Honey ! Honey ! Stay with him . I 'm gonna call 911 . It 's beautiful . So are you . He 's gonna know it , too . Who ? The guy you 're gonna meet one day . He 's gonna take one look at you ... And he 's gonna know there is nowhere else he wants to be . ♪ . I gave you my time ♪ . ♪ . Why you wanna ... ♪ . Sorry it took so long , honey . Charlie ? Charlie ? Charlie ? Honey ? Charl ... Honey . Honey ! You can 't run off like that . I thought ... What 's wrong ? Where were you , sweetie ? Where 'd you go ? Oh , Charlie . He 'd been , um ... Getting weaker since your grandmother died . I kept asking him to see someone , but ... He wouldn 't . He was so ... resigned . I guess he understood what was happening to him . That sounds just like something he would say . Damn it ! Damn it , Danny ! Hey , Danny ! Danny ! Carol , what 's up ? My husband just died is what 's up . My husband is dead , and I 'd appreciate it if you 'd stop making all that noise . Oh , man . I 'm so sorry . If there 's anything I can do ... People say that when we grow up . We kick at everything we 've been told . We rebel against the world our parents have worked so hard to bring us into . That part of growing up is kicking at the ties that bind . But I don 't think that 's why we kick at all . I think we kick when we find out that our parents don 't know much more about the world than we do . They don 't have all the answers . We rebel when we find out that they 've been lying to us all along . That there isn 't any Santa Claus at all . Hey , do you like Husker Du ? I think Bob Mould is probably as deep as it gets . I saw them last year in Sacramento . He was great . I 'm Nina Toth . - I 'm Lisa . - Hi . So how was your first day ? Brutal ? This place is totally harsh , so I 'm gonna make a suggestion . You wanna be friends ? For life . Lisa ! And that 's my stepdad . - Really ? - Yep . My mum 's in Berkeley taking a class in alternative nutrition . Oh , cool . So it 's just me and Danny . Well , I gotta go . Okay . Make sure you call me . - All right . - Okay . - Bye . - Bye . Think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world . And yet . I ask you ... What could be more alien ... Wait till she forms her own band . All right . Lisa ! Dinner 's ready . Lisa , come on . Dinner 's ready . Potatoes ... Lise ? Lise ? Lisa ? I 'm in here . Oh . Sorry . Everything all right ? There 's a phone number in my jacket pocket . Could you get it for me ? Yeah . Number one ... And number two . That ought to hold you . Mr Holding , do you have any champagne ? I 've got some Pepsi . - Pepsi will do . - All right . Just don 't expect me to give you the " today you are a woman " speech . Please don 't . I 'm really glad you called me . I 'm really glad you came . Ladies . Thank you . Here you go . - Thanks . - Lisa ... Today you are a woman . - Well said ! - Cheers . You 're the very first person I ever met who 's lived in a trailer park . My stepdad 's a musician , and the lady who owned a bar he played at owed him money , so we just wound up with this trailer . Don 't apologize . It 's very , um ... Rockford Files . I know , I 'm totally strung out on television . Hey , Nina , thanks again . It was a pleasure meeting you . No problem . Next time Lisa needs anything from the store , give me a call , I 'll tell you which aisle . I 'll see you at school . - Bye . - Bye . You sure you don 't need a ride ? My mum 's picking me up . So ... Guess you 're gonna go out and get all grown up now , huh ? Your mum would be sad she was missing it . You 're getting really good on those drums . Thanks . Danny , I 'd like to take Watson for a walk now . I 'll leave the door open for you . Thanks . Come here . Come on . Watson , come on . Shh ! Watson ! Watson ! Watson , what is it ? Watson ! Watson ! Watson ! Lisa ... Today you are a woman . - Hi . - Hi . Why do you think the aliens took all their stuff back ? Well ... What makes you think they took it all ? Ha ha ha ! - Enjoy . - Thank you . I hear this was quite a show . Oh , w ... What do you want ? I find I have a lot of free time on my hands . Imagine that . How 's Becky ? You want to have a conversation that doesn 't end up with me coming over this table and stuffing my fist down your throat , you stay off of that subject ! We 're not enemies anymore , Tom . We 're on the same side . I 'm a private citizen now . Our friends saw to that when they took all our evidence . What do you want ? You went from a sceptic to a believer in a nanosecond . That happened months before the Mojave Desert sightings . I want to know why . Maybe I just saw the light . What do you know that you 're not telling ? Say hello to your sister for me . Tell her I miss her . So , there was a lot of excitement around here while I was away . I 'm sorry I wasn 't here . I 'm fine , really . Your Uncle Tom has a lot of pretty weird ideas . You 're not starting to have the same ideas , are you ? What if I am ? You come from a special family . Your father had an amazing mind . He could look at things and figure them out . With people , too . He could see things other people couldn 't see . There was a lot about him that ... There was just a lot about him . Honey , your life is changing because you 're growing up . You 're not being abducted into a spaceship . You 're being " taken " into adulthood . Of the two , I 'd say that 's far and away the scarier proposition . Hi . For Austin , Texas , please . Yeah , the number for Tom Clarke . Thank you . How 's Pasadena ? You 've seen one genome , you 've seen ' em all . How 's Julie ? You two still haven 't gotten divorced ? Mary got into Yale , huh ? Thank you for that letter . I told you , they love me . Directed a play there my senior year , won a couple of awards . Gave Harry Hamlin his first part . How the hell you been , man ? Good . Really good . So , uh , what 's all this about ? They said they 'd tell us when we got here . Probably some investigation to find out how we lost a flying saucer . After 12 years , I think it 's about something a little bit more current than that . This is Mission Control . Do you copy ? Argonaut 1 , come in . Argonaut 1 , come in . Damn it. you guys . Where the hell are you ? Mission Control . This is Argonaut 1 . What 's going on up there . Argonaut ? What do you mean . Houston ? You 've been off-line 2 hours and 20 minutes . Houston. our last transmission was only four minutes ago . We were at coordinates ... Oh. my God ! About three weeks ago , we sent a manned mission into space . This launch was unannounced . The purpose of this mission was to put certain sensitive equipment into orbit . What sort of equipment ? Do you remember a program of President Reagan 's , the Strategic Defence Initiative ? Yeah . Star Wars . As you probably remember , there were some questions about whether or not this program was feasible . Before President Bush revisits the project , we need to know that it 's viable . So what did you send up ? A reactor ? One of the drawbacks to getting the program off its feet was finding a compact power system that could put out enough kilowatts to power both particle beam weapons and rail guns . You did ! You put this thing into orbit , didn 't you ? Our payload was highly classified . The capsule had been in orbit for 14 hours . It was two hours away from being in a position where the payload was to be delivered . The astronauts went dark for almost 21 / 2 hours . They disappeared . No contact . Nothing . Then they were back , clear as day . They had no idea they 'd lost 2 1 / 2 hours of their lives . The payload ? Gone . I guess they didn 't want a reactor messing with whatever they 've got going on up there . This is a waste of time . The people in this room represent $ 286 billion a year in defence spending . We need your help , gentlemen . Stop playing games and tell us everything you know about whoever it is who 's out there and what the hell they want . I assume you ladies and gentlemen have all seen E. T. They 're nowhere near that nice . We are back , baby , we are back ! I don 't think you get how big what just happened here is . We are reinstated , fully funded , blessed for as long as Bush is in . Probably after that ! Would you mind getting into this without me ? I 'm gonna keep on the Tom Clarke thing . He keeps getting calls from someone in Los Altos , California . The phone is registered to a Danny Holding . I thought I 'd run out there and take a look . For a while , I thought all this was a bluff . I thought you had something big , but you 've been on this Tom Clarke thing 12 years now , and the best you can do is check his phone bill ? Forget Tom Clarke , will you ? I 've looked at other things , but it keeps coming back to him . The Clarke family , they matter . They 're the key to this . This is about your father , isn 't it ? You 're just trying to finish something he started . What exactly you trying to atone for here ? You might as well be looking for Charlie Keys . You 're not gonna come in ? I said good-bye to your father 13 years ago . This is something for you to do yourself . Dad ? He isn 't me . He 's making me from the picture in your head . He 's lying . What do you want from me ? ! Leave my family alone ! Dad . Aah ! They 're coming for you ! We 've lived here for the last seven years . " We " would be ? Myself , my wife , and my daughter . Do you rent , or do you own ? Who rents a trailer ? Are you interested in this sort of thing ? That 's my daughter 's . Well , it 's actually my stepdaughter . Is that important ? Sure it 's important . Everything 's important . Your stepdaughter ? Yeah , from my wife 's first marriage . She was married to the brother of the guy who wrote that book ... Tom Clarke . Your wife 's first husband was ... - Jack . - Jack . Jack . That 's Lisa 's dad . We call him Jack , but I 've heard my wife refer to him as Jacob . Is this all part of a regular census questionnaire ? This is a follow-up , Mr Holding . It can never hurt to follow up . Well , here she is now . This is my daughter Lisa . This is Mister ... Jones . Mr Jones from the Census Bureau . I 'm very , very glad to meet you . Do you own any pets ? Oh , come on . Pick up , pick up . Tom Clarke . Uncle Tom , it 's Lisa . Lisa ! There 's a man here . I get a really bad feeling about him . You said I should listen to my feelings because they were from my dad . That 's right . You should . He says he 's from the Census Bureau , asking Danny a lot of questions . In civics , we learned about the census . It happens once every ten years . There 's not supposed to be another one until 2000 . What does he look like ? Blondish hair ... Shorter than you ... Kind of old , like 40 . He 's dangerous . You have to get out of there . Right now ? - Yeah. right now . - Okay Do you remember our plan ? Yes . Go to your friend Nina 's . I understand . I can be there by tomorrow night . My mum told me once that when you 're afraid of something . What you want more than anything else is to make it go away . You want your life back to the way it was before you found out there was something to be afraid of . You want to build a high wall and live your old life behind it . But nothing ever stays the same . It 's not your old life at all . But your new life with a wall around it . Your choice is not about going back to the way things were . Uncle Tom , thanks for coming . Your choice is about hiding or about going right to the heart of the thing that scares you . That was so awesome . Schooled that guy . - Got the hands for it . - All right , Charlie , see you . - Good night , Charlie . - See you , Charlie . See you guys tomorrow . It 's homey . A person starting college , a life of their own , they need homey . Homey . I kinda like it . How much ? I 'll give your mum a call and let her know we got you settled , but I don 't want you calling her or anybody else for quite a while . Tell me about these people , why they 're looking for me . The man that came into your house , his name was Eric Crawford . His father was an army colonel . His name was Owen Crawford . And he came after your father ... came after Jacob . Your Aunt Becky and I fooled him into thinking that Jake was dead , but I guess that Eric figured it out . But why was Owen Crawford looking for my dad ? This has to do with the things you write about . See ? You already knew . You knew the first time you called me . And you said one day , you 'd explain it all . Yeah , well ... I think you 've had enough excitement for one day . Don 't you ? Listen , if you ever need me , this is what I want you to do . I want you to take out a personal ad in the national edition of the New York Times and have it say , " Drummer seeking gig with ... Texas country band . " You 're young . You could still develop decent taste in music . Listen . I know . But you 're gonna be okay . Okay . Our first date , your dad and I went for hot dogs . You know , your dad never kept his own medals . I don 't think he ever went to collect them . But he carried your grandfather 's with him every day of his life . They were in his pockets when he died . Your grandfather was a hero , Charlie , just like your dad . How 's your job ? I like teaching . I think I 'm pretty good . I 'm sure you are . What 's this ? That is a picture of your father . He must be about eight . This guy with him is his stepdad . Your father used to talk about this . It was the most scared he 'd ever been in his life . Yeah , yeah . This is definitely that . What ? Well , his stepdad took him to a carnival , one of those travelling kind they set up in vacant lots . Some games , some rides , that sort of thing . Those rides , they can be pretty scary . They spin you around , turn you upside down , drop the floor out from underneath you . But none of that scared your father , uh-uh . It was the carnies ... The guys who ran the rides . He said there was something about them that just gave him the creeps . Well , like this guy . I guess if you were eight , he 'd seem pretty creepy , huh ? What was wrong with dad ? He had a ... He had a brain disorder . Made him believe certain things . What kind of things ? He 's dead now . Do you really want to remember this part of him ? I want whatever I can get . He believed he 'd been taken ... by aliens . Lots of times . And the men ? The people we were hiding from ? - I guess they believed that , too . - How about you ? I don 't know , sweetie . I don 't know what I believe . Your dad said once they were like his guardian angels . He thought they were protecting him ? No , he thought they wanted him for something . He believed they had saved him from dying in Vietnam . I think , in the end , he thought they were coming after you . They have come for me . More than once . That 's why he screamed the last time he saw me . He could see that they were already taking me . If you were eight , yeah , maybe this would scare you . But you know what , mum ? None of this scares me anymore . Now it just makes me mad . If they come again , I 'm not going without a fight , and if that lands me in some hospital room , staring out some window , screaming , then that 's what it does . What was he like , my grandfather ? I didn 't really know him that well . He kind of frightened me . How come ? He was always nice to me . I ... I don 't know . I guess he just terrified your father so much . All your father ever wanted from that man was a pat on the back . It 's amazing how not getting something so simple can do so much . When did you get in ? Night before last . I had a few days before fall quarter starts . Good to have you home . I 'm sorry , honey . He 's got a lot on his mind . Why don 't you leave him ? What ? Leave , as in pack your bags , walk out the door , and don 't come back . It 's not as simple as that . Yes , it is . He 's thoughtless , insensitive . If he can still get it up , he 's doubtless unfaithful . Honey ... You know it 's true . I have my compensations . I have you . So move to New Haven . You 'll have more of me and less of him . I can set you up with my " Perspectives on Science " professor . He 's very cute . You 're terrible . It 's in the blood . Do you think I look anything like him ? " Home is the sailor home from the sea and the hunter home from the hill . " I 've got something important to tell you . It can keep . I 've got earth-shattering news . You ready ? You wanna sit down or ... What 's your news ? I was wrong . " About what ? " you ask . " It 's like this , " I answer . I take all the money the generals threw at us , and I tell my guys , " Build me something that will pick up the impulse signals from those implants " ... The signals that were being amplified by that transformer . The transformer I said was the body we had stored at Groom Lake . Y-Yes . They build the thing . They turn it on . Voila ! Lights up like a Christmas tree . " Now , why does this make me wrong ? " you ask . Okay . These signals are big and bad and boosted . Somewhere on this planet , there 's still a transmitter going strong , as if when they grabbed all their stuff , they deliberately left it behind . What does this give us ? What I always said it would . We can track any implant , anytime , anywhere . Look at this . Find Alan for me , will you ? Remember that chip we took out of the girl from Cleveland ? We put it into the head of a guy named Alan . Works for the Department of the Interior . - Thinks he went in for a root canal . - Found him , sir . Get him . Motel 6 . May I speak with Mr Alan Stewart ? One moment . Hello ? - Mr Stewart ? - Yes . Hold for Dr Lamarr . Who 's on the phone ? Quiet . It 's Dr Lamarr . Just wanted to check on your root canal . Is that your wife ? ! How does she know where you are ? I-I 'm fine . Dr Lamarr . How did you find me ? Mr Stewart , I 'm a dentist . That 's my job . If you 're gonna talk to her . What 's the point of being here with me ? I have to go . I 've got a patient in the chair . You understand . I still don 't understand how this helps us . Oh , yeah . This sea of blinking lights , our very own galaxy of abductees . How do we know who goes with each blinking light ? Exactly . We cross-reference known abductees , their movements , et cetera , with the implant data . We name them and eliminate them . That leaves unidentified abductees . If there 's someone we 're looking for , we feed in everything we can ... Data from field agents , all of that ... compare patterns . Amazing what you can do with a modern computer and a couple of billion dollars in taxpayers ' money . Can you find Charlie Keys ? Yeah . How would you like to find somebody else ? You kinda suck . Do you think you can unsuck by a week from Wednesday ? We 've got a gig at the O.K. Hotel . I 'm in the band ? No one else answered the ad . No way , man ! Didn 't really mean it . About you sucking . You 're no worse than the rest of us . Thanks , I guess . Just felt kinda bad , like I hurt your feelings or something . I 'm tougher than that . First time away from home ? Yeah . I remember the first time I slept on my own in my new apartment . When I woke up . It took me a minute to remember where I was . I 'm lying there thinking how weird it is . Yesterday. when I woke up . Everything was normal . Today. it 's gonna be different forever . That 's exactly what happened to me . I expect to wake up any minute and be back in my old room ... " It was all just a dream . " Thanks for being so nice . It makes all of this a little less heavy . Anytime . No , you are not gonna take me ! You are not gonna take me again ! You get the hell away from me ! Get the hell away from me ! It 's open . What are you doing ? Sorry , Naomi . I 'm sorry . Nothing . Sorry . This is how you 're spending your leave of absence ? Sitting in the dark , reading , with a baseball bat by the door in case anyone drops by ? I just needed a little time by myself . I 've been principal at Lincoln for ten years , and I taught there before that . Charlie , you 're the best teacher I 've ever seen . I 'm not gonna lose you without a fight . What is all this ? That 's nothing . " The Alien Agenda : What The Abductions Really Mean " ? Compendium of Alien Races ? " Adopt An Alien " ? What is this all about ? Oh , my God . You think you 've been abducted by aliens . Do you have any idea how many people say that they 've been abducted every year ? Charlie ... People believe in those things because they have to believe in something . If that 's all it is , how come all the stories are so similar ? Because we see the same movies , we read the same books ... They 've been taking me since I was nine . The last time they took me was only six weeks ago . They came into this house , and they took me . I tried to fight back . I kicked and I hit and I bit . It did nothing ! They ripped me right through the living room wall ! No ! You are not gonna take me ever again ! You 're not gonna take me ! You 're not ! Charlie . There 's no reason at all why you should believe me . So I 'm gonna get proof , and I 'm gonna show you and anyone else who will listen that I 'm not crazy . Okay , Charlie . Okay . It took us almost two months before we found her . Something wrong with your system ? No , the system 's fine . She just doesn 't have an implant . Why would she ? She 's Jacob Clarke 's daughter . What do you do for an amputee ? You build them a fake hand . From their point of view , we 'd be psychic amputees . We 're missing something they take for granted . So what did they give us ? Implants . They 've given us electronic versions of what they have biologically . Pull up the images of the brain tissue samples we took from that fire in Alaska . Spectrographic analysis turned up some weird trace compounds . Colour code for density threshold . This sample comes from the brain of that twin who died in the fire with your brother . The twins were failed attempts at crossbreeding , but we worked from the assumption their cellular structure is almost identical to Lisa 's . Good . Now zoom out . The tissue is doing double duty ... Spirals of neurons acting as antennae . We found her . She was just broadcasting on another frequency . Hey , dude ! Bye . Hey , Lisa , how you doing ? We got so much to talk about . Don 't stand there ... Do something ! Unh ! The national edition of the New York Times. please . I 'd like to place an ad in the personals . I never told anyone about your father . I didn 't put it in any of my books . But when Eric Crawford came after you , I should have told you . I don 't know if I would have believed you . So ... This Crawford came after me because I 'm ... One-quarter alien ? Does make you pretty interesting . Wow . From what I have experienced , and I 'm only talking about what I 've seen ... They don 't want to hurt anybody . They saved you . They walked you home . Your father was very important to them . And I guess that you are , too . I think I know why . These are the matched repeaters . We started with anyone who had been taken more than once . We noticed there was a subset ... People repeatedly taken on the same day as others . We found Charlie Keys . Let 's assume he 's part of pair number 55 . Why 55 ? Numbers thing . Go with me for a moment . Charlie 's last abduction , right after we started tracking him , came on September 8th . If we backdate Lisa 's pregnancy , we can give her a conception date of September 8th . They 're breeding him with a girl who 's ... One-quarter alien already . It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? I 'm not quite getting it . That 's ' cause you don 't have my years of experience in the private sector . See , in the biotech world , most of our research goes into recessive traits ... Things we can breed out of a species or into it . What do we know about the Keys family ? The grandfather , Russell , is a bomber pilot . His son is a Vietnam vet and rescue worker . These men are strong , brave , extremely resilient . One other thing ... When they 're taken , they fight back . And the Clarkes ... Jacob , he could do things . My father was terrified of him . But he was physically weak . In a way , he was no more suited to survive than those mutant brothers in the Alaskan woods . And Lisa ... And Lisa , she doesn 't seem to have inherited her father 's gifts or his physical weakness . She seems to be nothing more than a carrier . - You ever cook with tarragon ? - Hmm ? It 's a very strong spice . One pinch is all you need . Otherwise , it overpowers the dish you 're making . Genetics is a lot like cooking ... Little pinch of this , little more of that . But what are they cooking ? That , my son and heir , is one hell of a whopper , isn 't it ? Super weapon or saviour , take your pick . Sometimes the best way to move into the unknown is to take familiar steps . Small steps . To do ordinary things to deal with something that is in no way ordinary . We 're always going someplace new. all the time . Familiar things just let us pretend that we aren 't moving into unfamiliar territory . You take those small. familiar steps . And you try to be honest . Not to live as if nothing had changed . But still to go on with your life . But there are times when what you need is a piece of how things used to be . Aah ! Mum ! Nina ! This guitar player , Tony ... I was auditioning for his band . I don 't think I like this guitar player . I went back to the rehearsal studio the next day to see him . He 'd left for L.A. Prick . No , that 's not what I mean at all . He 'd left for L.A. right from the rehearsal studio that night . A friend of his came by and got him . He hadn 't followed me home at all . Well , you went home with somebody . No , I didn 't . Honey , come home . The people you were hiding from , the same people who were looking for your father , Tom says they know where you are . They 're not gonna bother me . Because beings from another world are looking out for you ? Yes , mum . That 's exactly why . You weren 't here . You didn 't see what happened to me . Mum , I ... Mum . This is gonna be all right . I know it . I can feel it . You can , can 't you ? You 're your father 's daughter . You know that . Sooner or later , you two are gonna have to tell me what this is all about . It started when I was eight . I used to have these ... at the time , I thought they were dreams . There was always the same guy ... What 's he saying ? " The craft are leaving . " This man is a farmer in Tierra Del Fuego . He 's reported sightings for the past eight years . We think many of the craft stay out of sight around the Antarctic . One day , two weeks ago , he sees the ships , sky full of them , all above his field , middle of the day . Then that 's it . Hasn 't seen ' em since . Woman from Siberia has a similar story . And Norway , Alaska , Zanzibar , Australia . 144 multi-witness , confirmable reports from all over the world . How long has this been going on ? About six weeks now . One big rush , then zilch . Absolutely no activity . Not one sighting . Nothing . Six weeks , and you never mentioned this to me ? - I 'm mentioning it now . - This is still my project . Abso-friggin ' - lutely . Eric , this is me , Chet . We 've been through the wars , buddy . I was just giving you a little space , Letting you come to terms with your divorce and all . How you liking the single life , by the way ? What do you think this means ? It 's the calm . The calm ? Yeah . The one that comes before the storm . Speculation continues in the Pacific Northwest over the many reports of lights in the sky . The government will neither confirm nor deny the rumours ... They 're beautiful . Of secret aircraft being tested as part of a new Strategic Defence Initiative recently funded by Congress ... It 's gonna be okay . Is it ? Definitely . What if there 's something wrong with the baby ? Honey , really . It 's gonna be great . No , it 's not that . I think my water just broke . You 're gonna be all right . Yeah . Less than a minute apart . Will you call my mum ? Good , here 's the general . Gentlemen . General . We feed directly off the Cheyenne Mountain computer . This grid shows the actions of every known man-made object in space ... Screws from a 1984 shuttle mission , a screwdriver the Russians dropped off Mir . And thousands ... Thousands ... of satellites . You didn 't bring us up from Washington to see screws . We 've had unidentified before , but nothing like this . Look . We eliminate the ones we 've I.D. ' d , and we 're left with these . Earlier tonight , there were hundreds of new objects . We thought the system had gone down . And then the objects ... coalesced . That 's the only way I know how to explain it . There were lots of little ones , and now there 's one very , very big one . You 'd better have a good cover story , General . No one 's gonna believe this is marsh gas . - That 's right , a little more . - There you go . Can you scootch up a little ? What do you have in the way of drugs ? See if the doctor 's available . The mother 's b.p. is high . You 'll feel better in a couple of minutes . She 's nine centimeters . Stop pushing . I can 't . Listen to me , you have to stop . We have to bring your blood pressure down before you can have this baby . Get Dr Catrell . You 'll have to step out . It 's a slight complication . - What 's going on ? - You have to go now ! Sir , it 's coming down . Surface velocity , 388.1 meters per second at 249.4 degrees local . Altitude , - 75.2 meters per second . Deinclination and speed on this thing ... They 're impossible . It 's over Seattle and coming down fast . Flash alert to CINC-NORAD . Move to Defcon 2 . If it 's what I think it is , none of that 'll matter . Her blood pressure 's 200 over 100 . She 's had two seizures . There 's protein in her urine . She 's eclamptic . Let 's stabilize her . Two grams magnesium , five milligrams hydralazine . Altitude , - 37.0 meters per second . 54.4 at 231.2 , alt - 33.6 . 52.8 at 229.0 , alt - 30.1 . What 's happening to you is called eclampsia , but we 've treated your seizures , and we 're bringing down your blood pressure . Why is this happening ? 52.8 at 229.0 , alt - 30.1 . 51.2 at 227.8 , alt - 26.7 . It 's slowing down . It 's levelling out . - She 's stabilizing . - Okay , very nice . - No sign of foetal distress . - Here comes another contraction . If you can work with me , we can bring this baby into the world without a C-section , okay ? - Yeah . - Okay . We 're gonna try some pushing . 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... and push ! Push , push , push , push ! Okay , good girl . Stop . Nice job , Lisa . Vitals ? B.P ' . s down to 120 . She 's stabilizing . Very nice . We 're gonna do it again , Lisa , okay ? 30.6 meters per second at 213.8 degrees local . Altitude , - 9.3 meters per second . Great . Let 's just wait for another contraction . Just a second , and we 'll go again . Ready ? On three . 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... push ! Push , push , push , push . - Stop ! - Vitals still stable . Way to go , Lisa ! Estimated hover point ... 47-39-14 north , 122-18-34 west . You 're almost there . Just a few more pushes , okay ? Oh , my God . My God ! Why is there so much blood ? It 's all right . Doctor , there 's foetal distress . I 'm taking this baby now . Forceps . Prep suction . She 's in D.I.C. She 's bleeding out ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! We 're losing the baby , too . 25.2 at 211.0 , alt - 4.9 . It ... it stopped ! It 's disappeared . What ? It 's gone . It can 't be gone . We have the mother 's heartbeat . Baby is stabilizing . She 's stopped bleeding . I want a teal-amber search , code red , right now . Go . Find the damn thing . Go ! Hey . Hey . You 're not supposed to be here , you know . You were bleeding to death . What happened ? The bleeding stopped . Nobody knows why . I told you they 'd look over you . My baby ? She 's beautiful . Seven pounds , three ounces . Perfect little baby girl . Oh ... hi . Do you know what you 're gonna name her ? Allison . Allie . Her name is Allie . Hey there , Allie . My mum says that life is like a roller-coaster ride . There are ups and downs . There are big scares and slow builds and places where it levels out . The only difference with this roller coaster is that every time it stops . You get off in someplace totally different from where you got on . How 's your mother ? She 's fine . She does not send you her love . Thanks for coming . You said it was important . Your grandfather found this in Pine Lodge , New Mexico . He found it at a crash site . So it 's all true . What does it say ? No one 's been able to translate it . Maybe it 's a grocery list . He gave it to you ? Your father ? Left it for me . I found it after he died . And there was a note . My father and I ... We weren 't very close . Well , he left this for you . He must have changed his mind . My brother died . And your father just after that . Before he died , I think my father got a better look at me . What does Uncle Chet say about this ? Dr Wakeman hasn 't seen it . Why are you showing it to me now ? There 's a great deal of power that comes with the kind of knowledge I 'm privy to . I anticipate change . I want you to join me in the program , Mary . This is something that shouldn 't go outside the family . Hello , Thrill seekers . Look at you , little Mary , all grown up and beautiful ! How 's the quest for the Nobel Prize coming ? I got very close on a genomic mismatch scanning technique . " Close " like " should Miss America fail to fulfill her duties " close ? Close as in Patrick Brown got there first . You 're just a grad student . You 'll get there . Lisa had her baby . Little girl . Are we going to try to pick her up ? What would be the point in that ? God ! I 've been wanting to do this since you were 13 . Me , too . Why don 't you pick up the baby ? You don 't waste any time , do you ? She 's clearly important . In fact , I 'd say she 's the point of all this . Definitely . - So pick her up . - Take her . No , they 'd just take her back . They 're way better at that than we are . So what are we gonna do ? We watch and wait . And we figure out a way to take her that will work . Watch and wait . That sounds a lot like my father . I 'm nothing like your father ! I have a theory about who she is . You want to hear it ? Evolution tends to eliminate , or at least , uh ... Subjugate emotion . The limbic brain is still down there . But it 's way ... Down ... under . Why we don 't run through the streets killing people ... At least most of us . Imagine their abilities combined with the energy of our strong emotion . They 'd be cherry bombs ... she 'd be a nuclear explosion . Ladies and gentlemen , may I present to you White Shadow . White Shadow comes to us after spending the last three years jumping through a flaming hoop at a sea show in Florida . Hopefully , over time , as we come to know and understand these creatures a little better , we 'll become more caring and compassionate in our behaviour towards them . Here at the aquarium , it is our hope that we can bring you that one step closer to truly knowing another species . Any questions ? Once the dolphin 's been in captivity , is it possible to return the animal to its native environment ? Not in most cases , although it depends on how long the animal has been away and under what conditions it was kept , but in most cases , once an animal has been taken , there 's little hope of an uneventful return . What 's the matter with them ? I remember the first time that I ever saw dolphins . I was three . It was the first time in my life I can remember knowing that something was beautiful ... and it was the first time I had the feeling there was something about me that was different from everybody else .

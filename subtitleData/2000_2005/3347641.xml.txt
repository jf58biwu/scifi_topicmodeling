So the sooner you get your ass back to Moscow , the better . I was born in this town ! BEYONDWILL Beat it . We used to live here . Then we moved to Moscow . We who ? My Mom and me . Your Mom ? Do I have a Mom ? - Everyone has a Mom . - I see . And where do they come from ? Do you remember where children come from ? Not really . To tell you the truth , I 'm not quite sure myself . Mom ... I fear for you , sonny . You have some inner some inner kind of nonsense . You father had it , too . Mom , tell me the truth . My father wasn 't really a test-pilot , was he ? Sonny , here 's the holy truth : He was a test pilot ! He 's flown away from me forever . And my maternal heart feels ... Mom , where would I fly off to ? Sonny , he used to say exactly the same thing ! What a good mother you have . I see that you 're into fantasy . Very much . Here , for your lady . A present . Alright ... She 's got a new boyfriend again ... They altered their bodies , and lived in a vacuum , on the coral reefs of space . And they had wings , they could fly . Bouncing off stardust and solar wind . I like the way you tell the story . I keep forgetting that I 'm just actually reading about it . It all seems to be happening for real . You have a great imagination . My mother used to say I 'd never achieve anything , if I wasted so much time reading . So what happened ? Mom was wrong . I have everything ! So what else would you want ? Exactly what I have now , but more of it . I 'm not sure though . Excuse me , could you spare a few minutes ? What for ? Have you ever pondered the meaning of your life ? Sometimes . Do you believe in God ? When I was a child I thought God looked like you . God looks like all of us because we 're all his children . O-oh , so we 're his children ? ! Young lady , can I take a look ? It 's Her . Where is she ? She left . They left . We must find her at any cost . We must save her . It 's nice to have places , where you 're always welcome whenever you come . She doesn 't remember . You don 't remember a thing . Only I remember everything ! I remember everything in great detail . Understand ? Not really . Something wrong ? Maybe . What 's that ? Arkady laughing . Arkady ? He 's here ? Yes . He is our third friend . I helped him catch frogs when we were kids . For experiments . He skinned them . The skin came off easily , like stockings . I 'm sure you liked watching that . What happened to him ? The Coca-Cola Co . closed down in town . He lost his job , moved in with me and began to drink Then he found a new job and began to drink even more . He is drunk a lot . Why did it close ? Why did Coca-Cola close ? Who cares ? Look , maybe you could go and say hello to him ? Okay . I 'll go and say hello to Arkady . Then go . Anna , quit this game ! We need to clear things up . Hi , Arkady . What ? The spider 's keyboard has no ESCAPE key . Haven 't I told you not to drink ? All the time it 's spreading ... All the time it 's growing ... Many aren 't coming back . One day , no one will come back . Because there 's a spider sitting in the center of the web . A very big spider . Say , is everything okay with Ilya ? Excuse me . I 've got to go to work . Have you been in town long ? Since the morning . Notice anything strange ? What do you mean ? Nobody notices anything . ATTENTION ! DANGEROUS PATIENT FLED MENTAL CLINIC Hello - I 'm calling regarding the ad about the girl . - Where is she ? - Where ? In the kitchen , drinking tea . - What do you want ? - I haven 't decided yet . - You haven 't decided ... I 'll call back . It 's dawn , shadows from the trees sweep over the room . We haven 't slept at all , I 've brought coffee in bed , and you nearly turned the cup over . Do you really remember nothing ? Oh Lord . Anna , my dear , my love ... Ilya . Have you ever heard of Dr. Strauss ? What ? Dr. Strauss . Ilya , you 've made a mistake . She isn 't Anna . I just want you to leave . I remember . EARTH I 'm not asking you to tell me anything . I want to make sure everything is okay . I 'll take you to the hospital and we 'll say good-bye . Don 't be mad . No need to take me . Let 's say goodbye here . If that 's the way you want it . It was nice to meet you . Regards to the doctor . It was really nice to meet you too . I only want to help you . What is your name ? The Holly Saint ! One , two , Oh Lord thee ! One , two , three ! Be with me ! - I must go back to him . - Why must you ? - I promised . I must . - Too bad that you remembered . - He is so unhappy . - Why did you run away ? I don 't know ! I just left . They 'll smash the glass . This town is full of psychos . Damn them . Let 's go . You don 't understand ! Where are we going ? We 're not going anywhere ! I 'm scared for you ! I must go alone . We 're going to Moscow . The Sword of the Demon In the meantime , Ivan and the girl drive to Moscow but they have a flat tire . First we 'll go to Moscow . Then ... Where then ? Wherever we feel like . The world is big . It broke . Sorry . It 's okay . I don 't care . " And he said , " Turn back ! Turn back ! " Who said that ? There was a voice ... Wait . I want to tell you everything . They called me the Flying Baby because I fell out of the sky , right into a haystack from a helicopter . The helicopter had exploded in the air . I was put in an orphanage . Dr. Strauss read about me and came to get me . We moved from place to place . I didn 't go to school . He taught me himself , he brought me up , he took care of me . It was a happy time , but that happy time has passed . He started to change me . There were endless operations . He rebuilt my neurons , my bone tissue , my brain ! He exchanged my blood with the blood of seagulls . He changed my skin . Look ! It 's artificial skin ! And my left hemisphere . It 's all crystallines ! And campikks ! Hemoglobin - 63 Erythrobine - 16 Barabin - 20 Calcium - 0.2 , 017 , 304 A new kloop ! A blue klomp ! Tazz , kanazzions , cheidze , a rear flamveel ! You don 't believe me . I do believe you . Just don 't worry . Now pazzifazzten - and that 's it . Extinguished fovvells . But I 'm afraid of getting cocooned . I 'm so afraid . We must hurry . My Granny could see auras . She started seeing them after the concentration camp . She worked for a year in a collective farm . At a meeting , she tells the director , " You 're a thief and your aura 's no good . " They put her in jail . She never saw auras again . I once asked her when I was a kid , " What is an aura ? What does it look like ? " " She said , " Like an egg . Stretched out and round . " " Because of this , people look a lot like eggs . " " I ask her , " Who hatches from people ? " " Chicks hatch from eggs - so what hatches from people ? " " She says , " I 'll find out after I die . " She died today . I promised to mend her fence , never had time . Too late now ... May she rest in peace . And you , Katya , you don 't remember her ? I don 't . See , fella , who you wound up with . Doesn 't remember her relatives . She isn 't Katya . You 've mistaken her for someone else . Okay , here you are . Get out . And then the Russian Uitzrahor Zhrugr a demon of the statehood , mad with fear and losses , bore masses of Zhrugrites who started a desperate fight to consume their father 's heart and thus to succeed him . Never before was the state so weak . The American Uitzrahor Stebing became stronger than ever . Money is American . Food is American . Movies , music . Everything is American . And that is a manifestation of what I 'm talking about . Yesterday , I looked at a milk carton and it read , " There is no death . " I felt blessed ! " I looked again - and all it said was , " No preservatives . " I had misread it . Nothing is a misreading , and nothing is accidental . And cometh up is Navna 's wedding in the Heavens of Russia . Which we await like manna from the sky . But whatever happens , Navna , the collective soul of the Russian nation , Must enter the Heavenly Kremlin ! It was Her , Navna , who I saw today ! And it was Her you 've let go twice already ! How can we bring Her back ? I mean , how do we get Her back to heaven ? We aren 't really going to ? Yes . And we 'll escort Her , unless we are stopped by the Enemy . We had to hospitalize two orderlies . I don 't know what came over me . When did a psychiatrist last examine you ? What ? Never mind . She is mentally ill . The world of these kind of patients is depressing and mysterious . Much horror . Much happiness . It is a special universe . But the horror is greater than the happiness . Normal people rarely encounter this other world . Fortunately . No one knows why people go insane . Only doctors know how thin is the border between normal and insane , and how easily it can move . Did she ever tell you that she has the blood of seagulls , and artificial skin ? Ivan , look at me . I understand how you must feel . She can influence people . Her feelings become your feelings . Her impulse becomes your impulse . Her desires become your desire . In my opinion , this is all because of her enlarged pituitary gland . Strange , isn 't it ? Strange indeed . Doctor , may I ask you to unbind me ? Of course . But I want to warn you . You 're a sensitive guy . You 've been through a lot . Be careful or else you 'll end up with a nervous disorder . - Volodya ! - What ? - A chair . - What chair ? Ivan , you need to get some proper rest . Yes , I need some sleep . But , you 'll pay for everything ! Looking like a tiger with a golden cone on his head , the American Uitzrahor Stebing killed the Fourth Zhrugr of Russia . And the Underground Russia shook , and the vaults of the Drukkarg fell . After ages of imprisonment , out came the soul . Navna , the collective soul of the Russian people . She went up to the domes of Heavenly Russia . But Stebing , with myriads of demons , stood in Her way . Our blessed warriors met Stebing and Navna at the border of our level of reality . Alexander I and Vladimir Soloviev were there , as well as Pushkin , Lermontov , and Leo Tolstoy . Not only the blessed warriors of Heavenly Russia were there , but also Abraham Lincoln and Jawaharlal Nehru . They saved Navna from this new imprisonment ! But the warriors of the antigod , in their inhuman rage , prevented the ascension of the highest entity Navna . Now She 's incarnated here , on earth , among us . The girl we saw - remember her ? Yes ! I tell you , she is Navna . The soul of Russia . Dear God , please spare me the azzurill ! Not 3 x 12 gross-Y ! Spare me from GIST ! Don 't let me be smoked at 2 x GX MS ! Let it be direct Bulirubin , but not acid markers ! Please no more chemo differentiation of my biological fluids ! Let it be citookins ! Homeostasis ! Give me back 10 X 5 KOE ! 10 X 6 KOE ! Modulines ! Virulence ! God ! Give me the strength to stop loving Dr. Strauss ! You 're a lawyer , it 's your job , so spare me ! Okay , I can explain again . She 's not in a mental hospital , it 's some clinic headed by this doctor . What 's his name ? Mouse ? No , Strauss . Yes , I want to take her away from there and I don 't care how you do that . She doesn 't remember anything ! She doesn 't remember me , or how we broke up . Nothing ! This is my one and only chance in life ! Her name is Anna . Anna Lebedeva . L-E-B-E-D-E-V-A . Everything is ready . You can start . Yes . Love is still alive in my poor heart ... EARTH EARTH OTHER SIDE EARTH OTHER SIDE You 'll never love me . You 'll never change . You only drink my love , and now it 's drained . It went , like water through sand . And I don 't care . Look : it 's the world . God is on top . His creatures are below . His laws , his pleasures , his love , his wrath . I don 't play these games . No , I don 't want anything from Him . But I 'm from Him ! Want to return me into the herd ? Into the love of the herd ? I want for you what I want for myself . And I 'm giving you what I want to give you . But it 's a dead end I 'm a dead end . The whole world is a dead end . I don 't understand . I am giving you a dead end . - But you can 't . - Who 'll stop me ? His name is Ivan . Oh yes . Ivan . It 's hard for me to tell you about this , sonny , but this man is not your father . I knew it ! No , this is different . Once , I woke up at night because a star appeared in our window . A green star . It came closer and beamed a thin green ray . Right into my bedroom . It was Him ! Who ? The green man . He materialized from the ray . Your father is an extraterrestrial ! His name is Yezufe Ze ! Look ! Your father and me . Remember me ? Why have you come ? To visit a sick friend . How do I get out of here ? There 's no escape from here . Take these pills , or else you 'll become a total idiot . Ivan , do you remember us singing ? Everything has changed now ... Lord , let me see Her ! Give me a sign ! There beyond the sky . There beyond the world . We 'll be welcomed by the One Who is Near . The One Who is Higher will be with us . And Those Who are Better will be there too . They will forgive us . They won 't punish us and they 'll give us absolution . They know we are innocent . We only wanted to live in paradise where all are Happy . Happiness . Happiness . Happiness ! God give us happiness ! We know where She is ! We 've found her ! Are you worried ? I don 't want to see you anymore . You don 't have to . You 've seen enough . A new form of existence awaits you . A lifeless existence . I don 't want it ! You want ... You don 't want ... You don 't get any more wishes . Ivan ! Ivan ! His brain is turning yellow . No ! Come to me ! Stop - and the Lord will forgive you ! Thank you , but that 's not necessary ! EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD There 's no death . And there 's no life either ! A man ... A woman ... What 's the difference ? Oh I 'd like to get at least a look at Her ! We can 't behold Her just like that ! Have patience , brother Onufriy ! That 's not a TV you 're carrying . Eternity is before us My God ! The soul of Russia in a sack . Is it really possible ! Everything is possible with the Lord 's grace ! - Is that you ? - Anna ? What do you want ? Did you come to my place with Ivan today ? You came to my place ? You had lost your memory . You left and ended up in the hospital . You 're totally insane . Leave , please . I 'm asking you , did you come to my place today , or not ? Yes or no ? Sorry . It 's not her ! I thought it was old love , but this is new love ! " The guys came and said " There 's a phone call for you . " " It 's your mother-in-law . " See Stephan had left , he wasn 't around and the keys were with him . Me , I didn 't go anywhere , only to the phone . " My mother-in-law tells me , " Buy some tomatoes , cucumbers ... " " I say , " I 'm on duty ! " Forgive me Professor , she is an illiterate woman . She spent her whole life on a collective farm . Everything is for her children , for her grandchildren ... Where is Ivan ? SWORD OF THE DEMON Ivan . You damn hero . You ... Did you sleep with her ? What the ... ? When you came over here with that girl who I broke up with because of you . Because of your lusty nature ! You don 't understand ... I do understand ! I know everything ! True , she turned out to be a different girl . But now I love that girl ! And I had a talk with that marvelous man , Doctor Strauss ! He told me everything ! You don 't have a chance ! Ilya , I need to talk to you . I need your help . Would you betray your friend for money ? For a lot of money ? No . What about for love ? For a lot of love ? No . What about for a lot of money AND a lot of love ? Yes ! Betrayal ! Betrayal . Hello ? Dr. Strauss ? Yes , I 've made up my mind . No . I won 't betray my friend . Enough chitchat . What kind of people are they ? They aren 't worthy of God 's love ! It 's starting ... Isn 't it cool that I thought of dressing up in black ? Where 's the doctor ? Follow the roar . Open the door , Arkady ! I can 't , the door 's stuck ! Open it . I 'm not coming for you . Coming . You thought the brothers were idiots . Onufriy and Alexander . Because they didn 't check who was in the sack ? No , I say ! Look . You see only what you are capable of seeing . And we couldn 't see Her . And now she is far away ! Not in the town and not in the field . Not in the forest and not in the sea . We have to find her and then together with her ... What ? Are you ready ? Dynamite We are ! Come back in an hour . Put on your best clothes . For we shall never come back here . I won 't be able to make it in an hour , Father Vikenty ! I have to go back to town . To get there and back , plus changing clothes ... I 'll be lucky if I make it in an hour and a half . Take a taxi , brother . This is the time to hurry . Navna ! Don 't touch ! You can 't do that ! She 's sleeping . Wake her up , Arkady . No . She 's not sleeping here . What do you mean ? Here she is ! Sleeping ! She 's sleeping - there . The sleeping beauty is sleeping there . There means where ? There . I 'm going after her . One of us is going after her . Want to end up like this ? Head giblets all skewed ? There 's no coming back from there . Here ! What 's that ? A brain drill . I 'm ready . Not yet . Anna , switch off the TV . I need to tell you something . Go ahead , but be quick . Anna , we 've been together for so many years . I want to thank you . Over the years there 's been so much between us . Pasha , why are you so wound up ? I 'm thinking we 're not that young any more . Anything might happen . What are you up to ? Going off with someone new in your old age ? Or has your Reverend scrambled your brains ? Don 't say that ! I love you , Anna ! What angle do I put it in at ? Perpendicular . Enough . We can 't wait any longer . Off we go . God be with us . She 's waiting for us . Russia is on our side . I am late . Late ! Brothers ! Where are you ? I 'm here ! EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD How could you ? I was supposed to go after her ! Betrayal ! Lies and betrayal everywhere ! I was supposed to go ! EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD Say something , you hacker . Hush ! Arkady , look . Ivan 's trembling . Is that okay ? Maybe we better disconnect him ? I can 't stop him . EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD Pulse . He 's got no pulse ! What have you done with him ? I lost him . Is Navna the soul of the Russian people ? Yes . Then why doesn 't she look Russian ? Why is her hair so dark ? Because dark clouds gather over Heavenly Russia . Then why does she have this Jewish-looking nose ? So that you , and those like you , could betray her ! You hear me , Arkady ? I was scared to go after her . You were right . My fear was always stronger than my love . - He , too , is always stronger . - Who ? Doctor Strauss . You drink too much . Doctor Strauss is dead ! Wrong ! He is still here ! He 's here ! I mean , he 's there ! I don 't understand . I want my friend back , Dr. Strauss ! You heard that ? Heard that laughter ? Nothing was heard . I feel an icy chill from the depths of the grave . Ivan is dead . No . He isn 't . They just want to play with us . I want to play too . EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD That 's it . He 's on his own from here . EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD Go to the right - you die . Go to the left - you die . Go strait ahead - you die . I understand your doubts . I feel your weariness . But it doesn 't matter where we go . What matters is what leads us . We 're not looking for Her . We 're actually going to Her . I can feel the Domes of Heavenly Russia nigh ! Look ! It 's my tail . He made an electronic slave of me ! He 'll take Ivan away and then be back for me ! He 'll take my soul , and your 's ! And your brother 's ! What ? I never had a brother ! You had a brother . He was the little Kolya Pcholkin , and he still is . I saved him today . I opened the door . I showed him the way out and he fled town . You must find him , Ilya . You 've forgotten everything . Your father , the general , was kneeling in front of the doctor when the doctor connected his brain with a dirty plug-in . My father is a veterinarian . He 's not a veterinarian ! He 's a general ! A major general ! You are living with a fake memory ! This is not your life , Ilya ! Say kid , have you seen a holy preacher with six friars around ? I haven 't seen anyone . I 'm lost myself . And what 's your name ? Kolya . Kolya Pcholkin . - So where are your ma and pa ? - I don 't know . Ah Kolya , no chance for me to see the Heavenly Palace today . I don 't remember anything . I don 't remember anything . I don 't remember anything . The town is covered with darkness ! People have disappeared , and their loved ones have forgotten them ! Basements full of dirty plug-ins providing brain juice for the Other Side ! And I used to help him ! All for my own clean plug-in ! What a nightmare ! I 'm telling the truth . I didn 't kidnap the lad . I 'm with the friars and the holy father We were rushing to rescue the Blessed Virgin ! And I was late ! And ran right into him ! He 's telling the truth ! Arkady ! Everybody 's asleep . Fellas ! Open up ! Police ! Open up ! Police ! Hi . This is a scientific experiment . You ! The son of a general ! One day I revolted . I don 't know if you understand what it is to revolt . Without hope for victory , allies , or even the slightest chance . Not even the possibility to die . Endless humiliation . For every single second of eternity . Never to be rewarded . It only takes an encounter with someone like you with that dumb and merciless hero 's stare to realize that I have lost again . You 'll be able to liberate her . This world belongs to you , Ivan . Don 't take her from me . She 's all that I have She 's always known who I am . I love her . I love her as much as I 'm able to and as much as I understand what it means to love . Ivan , leave her with me . Idiot . Everyone 's under arrest ! Hush ! The fate of Russia is being determined right now ! EARTH OTHER SIDE THE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD Wake up ! It 's the Blue gas ! It turns your brain into ashes . Grey ashes ! Wake up ! I said , follow me . Wait , lieutenant . Let me see what happens to my friend . EARTH OTHER SIDE THE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD I 've come for you . Have a seat . My husband is about to come home . It 's me , Ivan ! Wake up ! I see that it 's Ivan . Move , I can 't see the screen . How can you listen to this howling ? What howling ? It 's cartoons . Look what your TV is connected to . To the outlet . Open your eyes ! It is connected to brains ! To brains of the people of Beyondwill ! Is this what you want ? Ivan ! Ivan ! EARTH OTHER SIDE THE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD She 's waking up ! EARTH OTHER SIDE THE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD Ivan ! Hey , Mr. Projectionist ! Switch the TV off . The lady is grieving . It 's not a TV , lieutenant . Ivan . Ivan 's brain EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD The soul leaves the body ... EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD The inevitable has occurred , brothers ! The Lord has sent His angel after Her ! Mighty is the angel ! And he 'll liberate Navna and will take her to the Heavenly Palace ! EARTH OTHER SIDE BOTTOM OF NETHERWORLD Ivan 's brain DAD ! Dad ! My dad is here ! They killed me . They destroyed my dream . They took my love away . Those damn extraterrestrials ! And little by little the door opens and in comes Dr. Strauss . He 's got a machine-gun in his hands . I grab my holster but he shoots off a round right from the gut ! I think , ? # ! ? . We 're all Russian salad . But no , the spaceman whips out his claws and shoots off a bunch of green lightning bolts ! All the bullets stop in mid-air ! Then Ivan smashes the doctor 's jaw . The doctor swings his arm around and punches Ivan . The guy hits the wall and slides right down . The floor 's burning but the doctor rushes to the girl . There was a girl , see ... He grabs her to him and whispers something in her ear . Like , come on , come on ... Ivan jumps over to him , and says " Can 't you see me here , ? ! # $ % ? " He has an extension cord with a steel prong . He plugs it into the doctor 's chest ! Arkady sticks the other end into an outlet ! And the doctor starts to shake and spit . His spit is like a flame-thrower . It burns through the wire . I think , ? ! # $ . Then I see Ilya , the general 's son . He tries to connect the ends of the wire . It sparks but no connection . Then he looks at Ivan , at the doctor , at the girl . She screams . She looks at me ... smiles . And sticks the ends in his mouth ! His teeth all scramble ! Ivan 's face just changes . He grabs the bare wire end , and sticks it into his head ! That 's when it started . One wire end is in Ivan 's head , the other in the doctor 's heart . The electrical current is terrifying ! The Doctor 's screaming and Ivan 's crying . I once saw something similar in the Ussurian Taiga , when a wild boar was struck by lightning . It 's so dark , only the doctor is lit up . Oh how he screamed . Then he got quieter . He flashed once more and that was it . People from town had already come to tear down the clinic . They discovered a basement full of missing citizens . Lying naked , in piles , with wires sticking out of them . Then you showed up with the boy and that psycho in a robe . That 's all I remember . My last thought was , corpora delicti are burning ! I see , lieutenant . Life in Beyondwill will never be the same . Dynamite Kneel down ! The Lord moves in mysterious ways . We 're going to live . Again ! Friends are leaving . Friends are flying away . It was supposed to be me . I was supposed to have flown away . Father Vikenty ! Brothers ! Where are you ? She 's here . Ivan ! Is it you ? Yes . A miracle has occurred . I 'm back . I thought I was over you . I 'm not an illness ! I 'm your ex-guardian angel ! Why ex ? Because I 'm a guardian-angel , not an astronaut ! The sun is rising ! His light ! It is love ! Time to leave . It 's time . Yes , it 's time . Yes , it 's time .

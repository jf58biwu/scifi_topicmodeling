 - I did ? - I 'm confused . Hello , David . Why can 't two grown drunk people act like two grown drunk people ? That 's when my dad came up with the idea to make a clone . He used you to save your brother . He was diagnosed with leukaemia a year ago . Do you got any proof that the therapy caused the stroke ? I think that the Peterson boy 's immune system over-responded . - But you don 't know . - Neither does Booker . The boy was sick . He died of a disease that we were trying to save him from . You studied the therapy . Does it work or doesn 't it work ? He might have suffered a stroke with or without the treatment . You 're willing to bet lives on that , Carlos ? The question that we are dealing with here is : if 3,000 kids get this treatment , will 1 die or 1,000 ? He 's in a coma , David . - Who ? - Justin ... Ricci ! You ... . ! You signed that boy 's death sentence ! You ! If Mick ... you know , he had a dream too , - he should like totally go for it . - Absolutely . - And I should help him . - Of course . - Yeah , okay , bye . - Bye . This here is your Mr. George Edward Plane . Oh , you 're fucking beautiful . I found it . A sample of the 1918 flu . A perfect specimen . 1x07 - Faint Hope A hundred and two , a hundred and two . It 's Kobe in the heat . You ever consider table tennis ? I thought you were on a flight to Houston . The cab 's on its way . How 's the pathology on Justin Ricci going ? I should have results soon . - You 're throwing it at me ? - To you . David , we ran all the tests on the gene treatment . It checked out . Shut up and play . The kid 's in a coma , Carlos . Four hours after taking the treatment in the trial that I sent him to . I should have been more closely involved . Oh , what ? You 're saying you 're the only one who could have done it right ? The whole lab worked on it , David . If something was missed , then we all missed it . Well , I don 't know about you , but I 'm not used to missing . Have a nice flight . Hey , David . Hit me . Oh , I got the brain scans you ordered on the kids that survived . Let me see . Okay . Of course , these kids didn 't have a blast crisis or a cytokine storm . They look pretty normal . - What do you think ? - I think they look pretty normal . Mayko ? Isn 't it a little early for that ? It 's never too early for basketball . Did you rerun the comparisons on Peterson 's and Ricci 's genes ? - You want to see the cyto genetic workup ? - Yeah . And all the kids in the trials had the same chromosomal abnormality ? Uh-hmm . An 8-11 translocation . It 's just the kind of messed up chromosomal you expect in an AML patient . Are we sure the RNA inhibitor got to the leukaemia cells ? In all the cases . The viral injection did what it was supposed to do . Oh , fuck . Look , David . I know I was pushing you . - I mean , if you had more time you ... - And I would have made the same call and I would still be wondering why Peterson and Ricci reacted differently to the treats . There 's nothing wrong with the decision to continue the trial . We made the right call at the time . Can you explain what happened to the Ricci boy ? He had a stroke like the Peterson kid , but not because of the same thing . What then ? Peterson had what we call a cytokine storm , which is too many immune activating proteins in his system . And that 's bad ? Too many of anything in the body is bad . - Okay , what about Justin Ricci ? - Ah , he had what we call blast crisis . Blast cells are these little baby cells , cancerous ones , and you get too many of those guys in your system and the same thing can result . You know : coma , death . But caused by something totally different . Exactly . So , is it the treatment , or is it a coincidence , something to do with the two kids , or is it just plain old bad luck ? - Well ? - Place your bets . Excuse me , can I help you ? Yeah , I need everything you 've got on Justin Ricci for the last 24 hours : Blood tests , brain scans , a copy of this chart , everything . Okay . Carlito ! I was just thinking of you . You look good . I look good ? Oh , my God ! Carlos ! You 're going blind ! I didn 't know what to get you , so I emptied out the airport gift shop . Blue Jays mug , salt water taffy , maple leaf-shaped , maple fudge . Carlos , how am I supposed to keep my girlish figure ? Why didn 't you let me know sooner ? I did . You 're here . My T-cell count 's not so hot , huh ? Your CD4 + is 11 % . There are things we can do . Are we talking cure ? We 're talking quality of life , Lloyd . Ah , give me a break . What about something experimental ? Some of this cutting edge technology my broker 's always telling me about . - There 's nothing on the market . - Then we go off-market . Carlos , what do you know about long-term non-progressors ? I 've dated a few . You haven 't lost your sense of humour . David . Uh-huh ? Can I grab a signature from you ? What for ? I put together the patent application . Oh , yeah . Flu strain 777456 . It sounds kind of dull . Government protocol . It 's all very official . Hmm . She 'll always be my Spanish lady . So , after I file , do you want me to get it over to the WHO ? - What for ? - A vaccine . Who decided that ? They 're the biggest , fastest lab equipped to make the vaccine . - I thought it was a no-brainer . - No . None . No data . Nothing leaves here . David , we have a pending patent . We 're protected , they can 't ... like they even would , but they can 't rip us off . I just don 't want the WHO , or any lab for that matter , working on my shit . - Our shit . - Yeah . You know what I mean . No , actually , I don 't know what you mean . We 're going to make a vaccine right here . And then we 'll think about letting it out . You 're not serious ! Do I look like I 'm wearing a clown costume ? David , the World Health Organization has more manpower , more equipment , they could probably come up with a vaccine in less than a year . What 's the hurry ? We found her , I want to go all the way with her . Okay , so this is like an ego thing ? Yeah , okay , I 'll go with that . Jill , file the patent and we 're going to make the vaccine right here , okay ? - Whatever you say , boss . - Thank you . HIV is killing my CD4s and my CD8s aren 't going to respond to a head cold , let alone something more serious . They 're making progress with the virus every day , Lloyd . No , I 've read everything : From the effects of potent anti-retroviral therapy on Kaposi 's Sarcoma , to the uses of labelled glucose to study lymphocyte replication . And finally , you got to long term non-progressors ? These people , Carlos , they 're HIV-positive and they never get AIDS . They can save me . You can save me . Welcome . Between Quebec City and the Atlantic Ocean lies a region of stunning beauty , a majestic landscapes of dense forests and breath-taking fjords carved out by ancient glaciers . Are you okay ? Oh yeah , I 'm just a little bit stiff from sitting down so ... Mick , your nose is like , bleeding . Shit ! No , it 's okay , it happens all the time . Yeah , yeah , it happens to my mom too , and , she blames it on thin blood , but I think it 's because she 's a record producer . Never mind . Don 't worry , just keep reading , it 'll stop in a couple minutes . Here the Saguenay River meets the mighty St. Lawrence and many species of whales : the finback , humpback , hunchback , horseback and paperback ... What are talking about ? Just seeing if you 're listening . - Do you have a minute ? - What do you want , Wes ? Caroline asked me to go through Booker 's finances . Why ? We became aware that he gets stock options if the treatment goes to market . You know , there 's this little thing in the Western world called capitalism , Wes . It can get ugly , but we allow individuals to compete for their own financial gain . Well , he stands to gain a lot of money if this gene therapy is approved . Don 't you find that a bit unethical ? He has a PhD in molecular biology and he gets paid less than an interior decorator . That 's what 's unethical . I 'm just suggesting that Booker has a little incentive to push this therapy through . Okay , so the thinking is what ? That after 20 years in a lab , Booker 's going to throw away his reputation for a couple of stock options ? Actually , $ 2,750,000 worth of stock options . Oh . Yeah ? - Hey , Carlos , where are you ? - I 'm still in Houston . - How 's ... - Not good . David , do you know about the research Judy Beewick has been doing on HIV ? - Yeah , it 's pretty hot there . - Do you know her ? Carlos , I hope you 're not thinking what I think you 're ... Do you know her , David ? We 've met at conferences . - Have you pissed her off ? - Probably , eventually , I piss everybody off . She works with HIV-positive people who never get AIDS , non-progressors . Wait a minute , how bad is your friend ? His HIV RNA is at a million copies . Jesus , Carlos , I 'm sorry . - Hello , David ? - Carlos ? Carlos , you are still there ? - Hello ? - Call me back . Great ! Ow ! Shit ! What the hell happened ? - Darkness ! - My LC / MS run . I 'll lose the vacuum , I need emergency back up . Bob , relax , it 's already tied into the emergency generator . - Right . It looks like it 's citywide . - Are we secure ? We 're good , the system 's on back-up . They say it could be as bad as ' 03 . Not just Toronto , oh , but the entire North-Eastern seaboard . I have an announcement to make . I will be having scrambled leftovers at my place tonight for anyone stranded without a gas stove . - Bingo ! - Free food ! Our cells have padlocks , which HIV needs a key to open . Long-term non-progressors ' cells have padlocks without keyholes . HIV can 't get in . - So , how do you change your lock ? - Stem cells . It 's me . In the dark , how about you ? We should boil the drinking water 3 to 5 minutes , not 35 minutes . No power in Baltimore ? How big is this ? Any chance it 's terrorism ? Congresswoman Schuller , I don 't think being trapped in an elevator 's funny . No . Right , right , save your batteries . Okay , good night . I 'm eating at David 's tonight . Wow ! Hey Mom , you have to go out and look at the stars . No , Mom , electricity doesn 't hold up a balcony ! Look at the stars . The stars are unbelievable . Just like when I was back in Vietnam . Diane ! No , I 'm sorry sweetie , I 'm losing you . Can you e-mail me ? No , that 's not going to work . Hello ? Diane ? - So , are you coming for dinner ? - Hi ! Uh , no , thank you . You 're mad about the patent . No , David , you 're the boss . All right ? Well , is this about Chicago ? What ? No ! Why aren 't you coming for dinner ? Because ! I don 't know- - It 's dark and I 'm going to go home . Have a bubble bath , climb into bed . Can I come ? You 're hosting a dinner party . Well , not all night ! Come on in , it 's open . Oh hey , Bob . Come on in , what 's up ? I brought wine , I had some left over . My cousin brought it . Great , come on in . Gamelon doesn 't like being alone in the dark . - Well , where is she ? - Outside . You want her to come in ? Behave yourself . Go ! Go ! Hey , hi ! So what are we having for dinner ? I brought wine , I didn 't want it to go bad . Ah hello , Mayko . Yeah , okay , so I froze it in my ice cube trays . - That 's a good idea . - Now , it 's melting . Think of it as ice wine . - Morrison . - Caroline , it 's me Digby . - You guys still in the dark over there ? - Yeah . We are . Our cell phones are off and on so you better get to your point . Right , I 've got an update on our friend Martin Jamieson aka William Zanzinger . Shoot . It turns out we 're not the only ones looking for him . - Who else ? - Oh , you name it ! The South-Africans , Pakistanis , I believe the American expression is " can of worms " . - Yeah . Why Pakistan ? - I don 't know yet . But wasn 't that scientist that was murdered outside your office ... Hira Khan , yeah . She was Pakistani . The closer we get , the bigger it gets . - Caroline ? - Digby ? - Hello ? Hello ? - Hello ? Thanks . What do you say ? Zucchini or courgettes ? It 's eggplant , Bob . I know the difference between an aubergine and courgette . I don 't understand the question then , what do you ... So , this is kind of romantic . Candlelight , a dog ... Did you have a nice day at the office today , honey ? Why , yes dear , very nice , I schtuped my secretary at lunch . Oh again ? You are a devil , aren 't you ? Uh-huh , and then , I made enough crack cocaine to buy you that little house in the Annex you 've had your eye on . Oh , you are so sweet . Then , I 'm going to stop seeing the pool boy . Any new thoughts on the gene treatment ? I 'm thinking maybe they should revisit the whole immune response in animals . You mean , stop the trials ? I 'm sorry . Gamelon 's been having some digestive problems lately . Oh , for a second there , I thought it was the wine . Was this sparkling before you froze it ? No . I think you 're reinvented double fermentation . - Thank you . - That 's a lot of bubbles . - What about the bubble boy ? - What about what bubble boy ? You remember the SCID gene treatment trials ? The kids with immune deficiency syndrome were treated with a virus that delivered the missing gene . Oh right . Then 3 years later , all the kids got leukaemia because the viral DNA inserted itself next to the wrong gene in the cell . So it replaced the gene . But , also inadvertently activated a cancer-causing gene . Are we thinking that might have happened to Justin Ricci ? The viral RNAI silenced another gene too ? - Maybe . Maybe ... What are you guy doing ? - Talking to you . No , I mean tonight . Let 's go to the lab . Sure . Gamelon , come on . Can we eat , first ? Okay , whatever you do , just don 't smile . - Why not ? - I hate fake smiles . How do you know it 's fake ? How do you know I 'm not actually happy ? So , what do you want to do ? - Okay . - Thanks . What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's just ... It 's weird . What ? We 're in a motel . Yeah . Together . Yeah . All alone . I guess I ... Is this whole whale watching thing just some ploy to get me in a motel room with you ? Yeah , that 's why I caused the black out too . Like , have you ever done it ? Done what ? You know what I mean . - Like , sex ? - Yeah . - No . You ? - No . You ? No . No ? Don 't sound so surprised . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to ... No , it 's okay . What about you ? No , not even close . I was just ... I was just wondering if you wanted ... Before you ... Die ? Just to know the feeling . To know how you feel , like you know , afterwards . Hey , it 's okay . Don 't cry . Don 't cry . I 'm all right . Just ... I 'm just feeling so bad , Mick . The process is threefold . 1 : Create in-vitro fertilized eggs . 2 : Collect stem cells . These stem cells will become the new CD4 cells with the defect that will save lives . Yes ? Are there non-progressive stem cells available today ? - No , we 'd have to grow them . - But , isn 't that illegal ? That 's why we 're trying to change the law . But a stem cell is a human life . Well , that would depend upon your definition of human and life , wouldn 't it ? If the stem cell were to divide and grow , wouldn 't it turn into a baby ? A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell capable of proliferation , self-renewal , production of a large number of differentiated functional progeny , regenerating tissue after injury ... Do you think you 're right in the eyes of God ? This is graduate science class . Theology is down the hall . Okay , that 's it for today everybody . Read chapters 6 and 7 , and I 'll read the New Testament . Excuse me , Dr. Beewick ? I 'm Carlos Serrano , I believe Dr. Sandstrom in Toronto spoke to you ? Ah , yes . David explained your situation . How close are you to a human test ? Legally , we 're ways away . Scientifically , we just need the right stem cells . If I could get you those stem cells from two non-progressors , would you include a friend of mine who has AIDS ? Where are you going to get these stem cells ? Canada . So you 'd what ? Culture the cells yourself and bring them to me ? If you include my friend in your trial . You know there are legal issues . Growing and harvesting stem cells is perfectly legal in Canada , so no laws would be broken there . See ya . - How 's is it going ? - It 's good ! It 's good . What do you got Bob so happy about ? Oh , I just like to make him laugh . Listen , Mayko , I heard a rumour ... I slept with him a long time ago . Oh , you slept with Bob ? Oh no ! God , no ! Oh , yeah , no , I heard a rumour that there 's actually a city outside of this building . - Yeah , it 's a big fun city . - Really ? We should go out sometime . You know , stir up some trouble . Sure . - When do you want to go ? - He wants to see us . The microarray analysis shows that the RNAI was doing what 's it was supposed to and nothing else . - Okay , so it 's not a SCID . Shit , I thought we had it there . Fuck it , you know what ? We 've got 6 kids in remission , 2 are negatively affected , but without this treatment , there 'd be 8 kids that are dying . You know , if I 'm wrong , somebody convince me . So Justin Ricci was just unlucky ? Maybe . - Can we be clear about anything ? - I think he was unlucky . I mean , to have a blast crisis and a stroke , all within 4 hours ? That 's like having 2 car accidents on the same trip home . Something like happened to me , I was in college and I went to the laundromat ... - Bob . - No wait . What did you just say ? I went to the laundromat and I forgot my clothes , so I went back ... No . Justin Ricci couldn 't be that unlucky . - It does seem kind of quick . - Why are we fighting this ? If it couldn 't happen in 4 hours , it couldn 't happen in 4 hours ! He was already in blast crisis when he was given the treatment . He wouldn 't have been accepted in the trial in that condition . He shouldn 't have been accepted into the trial . David , we have his records . He wasn 't in blast crisis when he was approved for trial . What records ? Hey , did I wake you ? I 'm sorry . I 'm heading back to Toronto . I think so . No , I 'm going to make it happen . Yes . Okay . Okay , sleep well . I just kept wondering if there was something I was missing , you know ? No , you made the right decision , David . I think I did . The question is , did you ? What are you talking about ? Treating the Ricci kid when he was already in blast crisis . How can you think that ? I mean , you read his prep charts , didn 't you ? Yeah , most of them . His white blood cell counts were being checked daily and they were rising on their way towards a blast crisis . We have inclusion / exclusion criteria that he met . For Sunday , Monday and Tuesday . You gave him the treatment on Wednesday . By Wednesday the Ricci kid was so sick , he couldn 't take the treatment , you gave him the shot anyway . I wasn 't aware he was outside the trial parameters . Oh , what ? You didn 't read the prep report ? All right , cut the bullshit . You know what I think ? I think you palmed Wednesday 's report and you gave him the treatment . If it failed , well it 's all due to sudden onset blast crisis , but if it succeeds , well you can tell the world that your treatment 's even better than you claim . The white blood cell count report was lost in the hospital 's internal mail . I 've used that excuse a couple of times myself . You fucking robbed the Riccis of what little time they had left with their son . You need a reality check , Sandstrom . - I tried to save their son 's life . - You failed . - The point is I tried . - This isn 't your call , Booker . What are you talking about ? The Riccis begged me to give their son the treatment . They knew their son was in blast crisis ? Yes , of course . Jesus ! I told them he 'd have to be excluded from the trial . Then why wasn 't he ? His chances of recovering from blast crisis is 0 , David . They begged me to save their son , they pleaded . You corrupted the trials on a wild gamble and then tried to cover it up . That 's reason enough to end them . Would have refused the chance , no matter how small , how remote , to save a child 's life ? Say nothing , nothing happens . Judy Beewick thought this was a good idea ? - Guess I got her on a good day . - So what do you want me to do ? Well , you know AIDS doctors , you have contacts at in-vitro clinics . Carlos , first of all , you 've got to get a couple of non-progressors , a male and a female . It 's easy , researchers have databases on them . Yeah , well there 's a small minor detail called confidentiality . We get around it . We play the professional courtesy card . Okay . Then you 've got to get them to fertilize . What ? We take an egg and we do it in the lab . You 've got to get them to agree to it first . It 's for research David . What HIV-positive person would say no ? How are you going to smuggle the stem cells into the States ? You 're going to hide them into a tub of butter brickle ice cream ? We send them the way we send all NorBAC samples . Caroline 's never going to let NorBAC get involved in something like this . Cut the bullshit , David . Okay ? She 'll never know . What the fuck is going on here , Carlos ? Lloyd was my first lover . I had a hard time coming to grips with who I was and he helped me . Are you okay ? Am I HIV-positive ? No . Well ... it looks like we got a lot of work to do . Dr. Hazard , David Sandstrom from NorBAC . Good , thank you . Actually , I 'm in a bit of a bind . We 're looking to create some long-term non-progressor zygotes and we 're in the market for ova and sperm . Tonight . Well , can 't you miss the first couple of innings ? Apparently not . Hi , my name is Carlos Serrano . Yes , Dr. David Sandstrom in Toronto gave me your name . Hello ? Hello ? Dr. Diallo , David Sandstrom . Well , if I said all of that , it must be true . I got your name from World Health . Yes , I 'm a research physician working on non-progressors ... Looking for long-term AIDS non-progressors who might want to donate eggs or sperm . Sandstrom , David Sandstrom . You have the sperm ? That 's fantastic ! Yes . No , no , no , I 'll take it . Okay . We 're going to take care of shipping . Thank you . What is it Wes , because I 'm kind of busy ? I understand you 're working on an experimental AIDS therapy . No , you heard wrong . You 're looking for non-progressor . I 'm HIV-positive . Are you a non-progressor ? No . But I have a friend who has been HIV-positive for 15 years . Do you know what I 'm planning on doing ? Yes , you 're going to need an egg from another non-progressor . Yes . If she doesn 't cooperate , you let me know . - We never had this conversation . - Of course . Are you Iliana ? Tell you what . You don 't ask my name , I won 't ask you questions . My name is Carlos , I have a favour to ask you . Hand job 's 20 , oral is 50 . You want to stick it in , it 's 125 for the front or 150 for the back . It 's not that kind of favour . You want me to fuck your girlfriend or what ? No , no , I 'm serious . Listen to me . I 'm a doctor , okay ? A researcher . I 'm working on AIDS . - I don 't have AIDS . - Well , I know you don 't . Look , you want to have a good time ? Okay . But I don 't want to talk about this shit . Please Iliana , listen to me . You have an immunity of sorts , something I think that you can pass along . If you 'd be just willing to have a simple medical procedure . What ? We harvest one of your eggs from your ovaries . - No . No baby ! - No , no , Iliana , it 's not to make a baby . - Just to take some cells from your body . - Don 't waste my time . You could save a man 's life ! You could save many lives . Please . It will only take a few hours . You want Iliana for a few hours ? You pay ! Of course . 200 right now ... and 200 after the procedure . - No sex ! - No sex . You 've been in Canada too long . - How 's it going ? - Almost ready . Does it look like a good egg ? If it 's anything like the donor , it will be tough and lively . I don 't know how you do that . You know , it 's a lot easier when somebody isn 't standing over your shoulder , Mayko . Got it . One false move and the egg 's toast , right ? I 'm getting tense just looking at you . Ready for the spermatozoa ? Okay . You want to make this a simultaneous orgasm ? Phew , that was fantastic , Carlos ! You got a cigarette ? Wait , wait . We 're like the only ones here . I don 't know , should I take a picture of the whale or you looking at it ? How about I do some whale seeing faces and then , you don 't have to chose ? - Okay , sure . - Okay . Look at the whales . Big whales ! Okay . Lloyd , before we do this , there are a couple of things that you need to know . 1 : this is very experimental . I know , you idiot . I sent you there . - It may do absolutely nothing . - Just give it to me . - Do you know how this is supposed to work ? - What do you want to know ? How the stem cells actually give my immune system a fighting chance ? You want me to diagram the molecular structure of a CD8 cell for you ? - Give me that notebook , over there . - Okay , you 've made your point . Then stop playing doctor . Although , I must admit I find it very sexy . Then shoot me up . There 's one more thing you need to know . What ? Ti amo mi querido . I love you too Carlos . - You want some ? - No , thanks . - Are you getting cold ? - No . Any whales ? Any second . " Bonjour Monsieur . " " Nous sommes ici pour les baleines . " " Oh , les baleines ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! " " Ce n 'est pas la bonne saison . " - What ? Sorry ? - No whales . No whales . What ? Wrong season . No whales . Don 't listen to him . We 're going to see some . Seriously , just keep watching , you 're going to see one , I know it . Here , would you like to try ? - Hey . - Hey . - Have you come to a conclusion ? - Yes , I have . Are you going to share it ? The trials should continue . What about the Ricci and Peterson kids ? We couldn 't connect their deaths to the treatment . Oh . Okay , so Booker 's clean ? We weren 't asked to judge Booker . We were asked to judge his trial . I can 't know his motivation , but I know his biology and it 's good . Even if he is a pompous asshole . But , you know , remenber , these are trials , so ... All I 'm saying right now is that there 's no reason to say the treatment is bad . These are very sick kids , so , is the drug going to save them ? It saved 6 of them , we need to keep studying it . - But folding might still be right ? - Sure . And more kids may die ? Yeah . But , ultimately , this treatment could save many lives , so ... I don 't know how you do it . - How do you play God ? - Oh , I try not to . This was your idea , remember ? Oh my God ! Look ! I think I see a whale ! Seriously , look , look ! Mick , can you see it ? Mick ? Mick ? Mick ? Mick ? Hello , Sarah , it 's me . She 's fine , sort of . A friend of hers died and she 's ... No , no , no , natural causes , but she really needs you out here right now . - How come you 're in Toronto ? - My God ! You look so grown up ! Look , I just lost my friend ... my best friend ! All you care about is putting each other down . Lilith . The CIA got intercepts of a plan to create a black out and use the chaos to move terrorists from Canada to the U.S. Right , blame Canada ! So , underground wires seemingly spontaneously combust . And why do they think it 's terrorism ? I don 't know . Because that 's what you do these days . You know who 's really happy about this black out ? Who ? That guy on death row who was supposed to get the chair this morning . Caroline ? There 's been another explosion . Chicago .

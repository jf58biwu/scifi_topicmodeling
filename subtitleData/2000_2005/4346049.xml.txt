Pretty long , eh ? Yeah , really long ! But what 's that ? That 's my What-lf Machine . Ask a " what-if " question and it simulates what would happen . - Does it really work ? - Of course ! It 's just not very long . I got a question ! As a robot among humans , I never feel accepted at parties or nude beaches . So I 've always secretly wondered ... What if I was 500 feet tall ? Let 's watch , shall we ? My work here is done . I 'm so lonely since I came to the future . Will you be my friend ? Who are you ? I 'm a big robot ! And I want a big cereal . You too ? Will you be my friend ? Put her there , pal ! No , your wallet . Three , two , one , zero ! That calms the shakes . - Quit it ! - Stop ! He 's not your enemy ! He 's just a misunderstood ... Well , there goes the neighborhood . - And another one . - We 're jerked ! - Nothing can stop a monster that big ! - Except an equally big monster . We can try my experimental enlarging ray .

And this is how it must end ? Who 's the real seven-billion-ton robot monster here ? Not I. Not I. Good night , sweet prince . Interesting stuff . Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest ! Well , Leela ? Care to try the What-lf Machine ? I don 't know what to ask about . Just pick something , woman ! Yeah , be more impulsive . Like this . Go , man , go ! I can be impulsive . It just takes me a while . All right , let 's do it . What if I was a little more impulsive ? Just a little . Not too much . Look what I bought on a wild impulse ! New boots ! They 're like my old ones , but with a crazy green stripe ! Never know what I 'm gonna do next . Come here , Leela . I have something important to say . I 'm old and I need an heir . Someone to spend my riches and care for my man-eating anteaters . The others aren 't levelheaded . They 're too impulsive . Not like you . Not like predictable , dull-as-dishwater Leela . Hello ? New boots ? So I 've made you my sole heir . The day I die , you 'll be a very wealthy woman . Oh , my , yes . Incredibly wealthy . The day I die . Because you 're so un-impulsive .

I 'm shocked ! Food in the disposal . Hair and flesh go in the trash ! I couldn 't stop . Wait . Don 't you care that I killed him ? Ain 't nothing wrong with murder as long as I can wet my beak . Blackmail ? I prefer the word extortion . The " x " makes it sound cool . Please , I 'm made of metal . You ... Wait , not the microwave ! Okay , that 's it . No more killing . Next time , just have a stick of gum . Now , to hide the body . Honk , honk ! Sporty go-cart , Leela ! So hip and sexy ! So unlike you . Got any gum ? No . Everyone 's here . - Who are you ? - Scruffy , the janitor . - I 've never seen you before . - I 've never seen you neither . Quiet , please . I 've called you all here to watch me gradually solve the crime . One of you is a big murderer ! The killer left one fatal clue . The boot print on this lab coat . Couldn 't be me . I never wear boots . See ? What smells like boot feet ? This is preposterous ! Obviously , the murderer is ... My next clue came at 4 : 15 , when the clock stopped . Two hours later , at 4 : 15 I discovered the murdered body of Amy 's dead , deceased corpse . I know who killed them people . In Scruffy 's opinion , it were ... It 's as I suspected . The crime is unsolvable . A letter from my friend Bender . " Dear Doctor Jerk-berg , if you 're reading this , I 'm dead . The murderer was ... " My God ! It can 't be ! The murderer , it was ... I 'm bored . You 're boring . What 's on TV ? Could you get the lights on your way out ? What 's that ? Lobster . You want some ? Sure . - I think I figured out those deaths . - Really ? Are we near an Indian graveyard ? - No . - No ? Then it was you ! What 's come over me ? I killed one person on impulse . Then another . And another . That covers three . Now , to make sure you won 't talk I 'm gonna have to do something really impulsive ! So , what do you think of the impulsive new me ? I like it . Good . Now let me just get the lights . I really like it . Who else has a question for the machine ? Scruffy ? Fry ? I have one . - What if Bender was giant ? - We already saw that . I know . I want to see it again . No , ask something less stupid . Oh , how about this ? What if I never came to the future ? There , now that question is somewhat less stupid . What would happen if Fry never came to the future ? Hello ? Pizza delivery for " I.C. Wiener . " Oh , crud . Here 's to another lousy millennium . You 're going back in the toilet ! What is it ? A rip in the very fabric of space-time . Hey , look ! An ugly , scared guy ! Is one of you I.C. Wiener ? If that 's his pizza , then I am . You believe me about the monsters , right ? There 's only three monsters , kid . Dracula , Blacula and Son of Kong . Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough ! The usual , Professor Hawking ? No , I 'd like something good . Hawking , you 're all right ! Stephen Hawking ! Didn 't you invent gravity ? Sure . Why not ? Has anyone ever seen a hole in space with monsters in it ? If I 'm the first , I 'll call it a " Fry Hole . " There is no need to Worry . I must go . There is much to do . Hawking , your pizza ! Toss it in the garbage . There he is . Seize him . Who said that ? Who are you ? I 'm Al Gore . These are my V.P. Action Rangers . Our sole duty is to prevent disruption in the space-time continuum . Isn 't your sole duty to break ties in the Senate ? That , and protect the space-time continuum . You want to see my Fry Hole ? Oh , yes . But first , meet the team . You know Stephen Hawking . Nichelle Nichols , a.k.a. Commander Uhura . Incoming transmission from MCI . It sounds like low rates . I 'm in the tub ! This is Gary Gygax , inventor of Dungeons Dragons . Greetings ! It 's a pleasure to meet you ! And our intern , Deep Blue , the chess-playing computer . Bishop to knight 4 . Not every mission can be solved by chess , Deep Blue . Where am I ? You 're in a terrestrial transport module . A school bus ! What 's going on ? It 's about that rip in space-time . I call it a " HaWking Hole . " Hey , I saw it first ! Who Will The Journal of Quantum Physics believe ? Apparently , something was supposed to happen but didn 't due to quantum flux . So we had to beat you with rackets . If that event doesn 't occur the universe will be destroyed . As an environmentalist , I 'm against that . So then I almost fell into this thingy . I call it a " HaWking Chamber . " But I missed and wanged my head . Well , obviously that wang should have killed you . - What ? - Let 's finish the job ! No , wait ! There must be a peaceful ... - Hold him down . - Check . Something 's wrong ! Murder isn 't working . Let 's try something else . We should ... Put the dice away . I 'm getting an idea !

Then where are we now ? I can darn well tell you where we 're not . The universe . Eternity with nerds . It 's a Star Trek convention all over again ! Anyone want to play Dungeons Dragons ? - Yeah . - Sure . I 'm a 10th-level vice president . That was preposterous . Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria . This thing isn 't worth the gold it 's made of . Anyway , the Fing-Longer seems to be a success . - Way to go ! - Right on , professor . So that 's how it would be if I 'd invented the Fing-Longer . A man can dream though . A man can dream .

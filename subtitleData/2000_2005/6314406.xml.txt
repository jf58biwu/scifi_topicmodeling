 How can you say that ? Because it 's true . You 're exactly like a Sebacean . In what way am I like a Sebacean ? In that you think that you are superior , and that you treat the rest of us like animals . When have I ever treated you like that ? Only every time we have to make a decision and you think that the best idea is your idea . Oh , yeah . They are going to write songs about how you guys tore this place up . Right . Go away . I am away . I 'm on vacation ! Pip , beat it . Has it occurred to you why Pilot banished you from Moya ? No . Because you 're both acting like a couple of immature trijnots ! I can 't believe you pissed him off . I didn 't piss him off . You pissed him off . You did . - Grow up . Or ignore each other , or kill each other . But just stop fighting all the time . I 'm out of currency . Here . Playland for the rich too classy for ya ? Effervescent spirits costs more than cheap raslak . But you ... you just keep on hunting for that long-range cargo hauler of your dreams , 'cause he 's bound to throw up in your lap one day . When she passes out , I 'll ... I 'll take it back to Moya . In the meantime , I 'm gonna have some fun . I suggest you guys do the same . See what you did ? You did it . - You did . You . - You . Did . - You . You . - You . Yeah , right , you did it . This alien is Raxil . There 's one like her on every planet . And these girls ... well ... we never did get their names . Ah ... Are you boys ... a couple ? Ha ! No ! No . No-no ! - No . Can you handle some girls looking to party-party-party ? I am a full-blooded Luxan . And ladies , I have so much cash in my pocket that I can assure you that the three of us will be out of here on our hands and knees come sunrise tomorrow morning . I 've been arrested for saying exactly the same thing on four different planets . Whoa ! Fe 'Tor . Bad guy . Dressed in black . Another bad guy , the guy with Fe 'Tor . Crichton ! Crichton , wake up . Wake up ! Crichton ! What happened ? What didn 't happen ? Oh God , there were girls , right ? Feathered chicks . The rainbow coalition . Girls , breasts , blue breasts , green breasts . I don 't know . All I know is ... they spiked our drinks and took our money . They rolled us ? Yeah , they rolled us . You know these ... My pulse pistol ! - shots that we took , they spiked ' em . My pulse pistol . They took my damn pulse pistol ! No one stole your pulse pistol . We 're on lomo . No weapons allowed . Your pulse pistol 's on the Transporter Pod . I don 't remember that . Where are my boots ? Ooh ! - Hey ! Oh ! Whoa ! Ho , ho ! D 'Argo ... we 're in a window . There are people watching . Uh-huh . I think they 've been there for about seven arns , so ... why don 't you just get dressed and give them a good show , sweetheart ? I am dressed . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . I said ten solar days away from Moya , and I meant ten . Pilot , give me a break . I 'm trying to tell you what happened . I understand , Crichton . However , my inclination is not to accept any explanation . Well , I can 't go back down there . I 'm persona non grata on lomo . LoMo non grata . Can 't do it . Not going . Uh-uh . You return beat up , inebriated and broke after only two . Yeah . But that 's what I 'm trying to explain to you . You said if I could explain it then I ... I could stay on board , right ? Proceed . How the hell did we end up in that window ? I don 't know . You don 't think we , uh ... I said , I don 't know ! Hey , don 't ... don 't yell . It hurts . Have we heard from Jool or Pip yet ? They haven 't been answering their comms . Right , go find ' em , Lassie . It was your idea to come down here in the first place . You go frelling find them . Aren 't you worried about them ? Ah , hell , no . They 're probably sleeping off the fun they had last night . Shut up . - Hey , don 't tell me to shut up . You know , you 're the one who told her to have fun . What do you think " fun " is for Chiana ? What ? - Uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , shut up , shut up . Isn 't that the pile of dren we saw outside the window ? Yeah . Smile . She was also in the bar last night , wasn 't she ? I 'm so glad you 're not angry , you know . I thought you were gonna ... oh ! What are you going to do ? ! I 'm going to scream ! No , don 't scream . Did you steal our currency ? What you talkin ' about ? I didn 't steal anything . I came over here to talk to you . You know ? But you looked so angry before , when you were in the window . Not talking about the window ! Alright . Lemme give you something here . I saw it all . They 're in trouble . Yeah , they 're gonna be in a lot more trouble when I find them . The green and the blue chick ... Not the blue and green chick . No , no , no . I 'm talking about your females . I 'm talking about the pretty gray one and the really annoying gold one . What about them ? They 're in trouble . I can show you . I can show ya what happened last night . Lemme go . D 'Argo , look . Chiana knows how to look after herself . We got to find our money and I 'm pretty sure that this grommet is involved . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . I got something for ya . I got us a recording of all that happened last night . I mean , you don 't believe it , you can see it for yourselves , you know ? It 's talking crap . We got rolled , and I don 't think we need ... You 're broke . You can 't get robbed again . I mean , what do you think , you think I want your shoes ? I don 't know what you want . You 're not very smart , are ya ? Now he , he 's got a brain . But you , you 're a bit of an idiot . Huh ? - Huh ? - Huh ? Yeah . Yeah . - But I 'm bigger . Ow , ow ! All right , sorry , sorry , sorry . All right , all right , have you spoken to your females yet ? I bet you haven 't spoken to them yet . Have ya . No , we haven 't spoken to them 'cause they might be sleeping . They could be ... - Oh yeah , princess . How do I know you haven 't spoken to them yet ? Huh ? You don 't know that , do ya ? No . Well , my point is ... - Will you just tell us ? Tah-dah ! That 's Jool 's comm . - How you know ? It 's melted around the edges from when she screams . Now , do you wanna see what happened last night or not ? 'Cause I could just , you know , not . All right , all right , you don 't have to push me . The point is , you see , we can be friends . You can trust me , ya see ? Everybody trusts me , ' cause I 'm a female of my word . Oh , what is that ? ! It smells like ... Shh , shh , shh . Close but no . It 's ... it 's merimar root , ya know ? Kabaah uses it in all his pleasure elixirs . Very low quality , but we don 't tell him that . Mr. Kabaah ? Mr. Kabaah ? Wake up ! Don 't yell . Well , I have to . He 's as deaf as a bubba . Wake up ! Go away . I don 't need your trouble . - Trouble ? ! Me ? No , no , no , you must have me confused with someone else . I 'm not confused . I 've seen you snooping around , seen you when you didn 't want me to . Ooh ... Is that a Hangi ? A Hangi ? I don 't believe you . What 's a Hangi ? Creature with removal eyes . Optic nerves that continue to record and send back images even after they 're separated from the body . Leave ' em in somebody 's bed chamber ... You brought us to see a pornographer ? I 'm deaf , not dead . Stop talking like I 'm not here . What do you want ? I know you 've always got an eye hanging out at the lomo Bar . So ? We 're looking for a Nebari and an Interion . You want the show ? Yeah , yeah , that 's right . Who 's paying ? You don 't think you get the show for free , do you ? - We have no currency . - You know that . Come on , you gotta have something . All right , then , you know what ? We are being scammed . Ren and Stimpy here are teaming up to rip us off . Let 's get out of here . This fannix ? I would never team up with her . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Just to prove to you , I 'll pay . There ! Where did you get that currency ? - Why , what 's the matter ? All of our brandaar tiles were stolen last night . So ? Do you have your name on ' em ? No . No . They aren 't yours . They 're mine . They 're mine . You two have really got to work on your attitude , you know that ? Kabaah , give them a tentacle . Put one of these on your eye . You gotta be kidding me . These will link back to the optic memory of last night and act as a three-dimensional image of everything that happened in the bar . You want us ... to put one of your tentacles ... in our eye ? Don 't be such a grimmat . Just do it ! Ooh ! Ooh ... This is , uh ... this is ... D 'Argo , y-you seeing this ? This is , um ... Well , it 's , um ... it 's incredible . Kabaah , show us the females . Oh , hello . Don 't give me that . You 're jealous . All right . Yeah , this looks really dangerous . Those girls are in fear for their lives . Yep , all right , have you got anything else ? Kabaah , get your eye out of the gutter . Show them later . Later ! That it ? Yeah . You . What , me ? Watch . Ooh ! I just won a bet . Raslak . Make it a large . You smell so exotic . I like watching you dance . I like watching you and your friend , but especially ... - you ! - - Ooh ! Oh , big deal . She 's been hit on by some guy . Knowing Chi , he 's probably more trouble than she is . Wait , there 's more . I have something for you . You . I like the look of you . Who is this bastard ? That 's Fe 'Tor . Ow ! Ow ! Whoa ! Whoa ! What the hell just happened ? ! You didn 't pay me enough to cross Fe 'Tor . Who is Fe 'Tor ? He was what I was trying to show ya . Fe 'Tor 's the most famous kasnik around here . He rounds up the good-looking ones and they all just party , night and day , night and day . What , does he ... do them ? He hurts them . He gives them the whiff . Well , you saw . And then they do anything . I 'm not sure , but I think this is Fe 'Tor 's sister . Her Freslin is still adequate . I 'm not interested in ... adequate . We gotta get your females out of there . Do you know where we can find them ? Yeah , got an idea . Whoa , hey , whoa . D 'Argo , D 'Argo , wait . What we saw is from last night . Chiana could not even be with that guy anymore . We can 't have another auction yet . It 's too soon . Too dangerous . I think our female upstairs might be exceptional . For her , we can risk it . D 'Argo , who are you believing this Raxil thing here ? Chiana was having fun . She could be walking back into the bar right now . We don 't know . Why don 't you go to the bar and wait for her ? D 'Argo , I ... - It 's fine . I 'm just going to go along and say ... hello . Squeeze her dry . I 've been comming the girls . No answer . You find ' em ? Found them . Deliveries around the back . Oh . Oh , around the back ? Yeah . - Uh ... Okay , thanks . They okay ? They 're fine . Jool ! Jool ! Are you all right ? Oh , D 'Argo . Oh . Come in with me . Come on . - Where is Chiana ? Over there . Hey . Um , uh ... We thought that perhaps you might be in some trouble . I 'm not in any trouble . At least none I don 't wanna be in . Where 's Raxil ? She didn 't wait around like she said she would . That way . Oh , oh , did you see them ? Are they in trouble ? - They were taking a bath . I , uh ... Mmm ... We saw him give you something . Some stuff . Oh . Were you spying on me ? No . No . D 'Argo , I came here to have a good time . Does that make you jealous ? No , I 'm not jealous . It 's just that ... 'Cause you and me , we 're ... we 're not together anymore , are we ? No , we 're not together anymore , but ... Oh well , then let go of me . All right . You and Jool are coming with me . Let me go ! - Chiana , are you all right ? She 's fine . Why don 't you let go of her then ? Why don 't you mind your own business , you miserable little tralk . Oh , whoa , whoa , whoa whoa , whoa , whoa ... They had weapons . You said it would be a party . But they had weapons that they put to my head . They had weapons ? Yes , but they weren 't pointed at Chiana . They were pointed at me . Please , please . Calm yourself . I don 't like to show force , but you are in my residence and you are attacking my people . Now get out . Chiana . D 'Argo , get out . Go ! Oh , we 're fine , D 'Argo . Really . We 're just ... Ah , D 'Argo , you 're going to kill her . At the moment , I do not have a problem with that . What did you spray on him ? Freslin . Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! This makes no sense . You make no sense . What ? What doesn 't make sense ? She nailed him with Love Potion Number 9 . It made him dance ? Well , it 's a way to meet girls . Pilot , just listen to this , all right ? This is important . This is about the deal . It 's about Freslin , lomo 's dirty little secret . I suspect the dirty little secret is you spend all your currency on pleasure , and now ... Hey , you know what ? It 's a weird universe out there , man . You don 't know that cause you 're spending all your time indoors . Just let me finish my story . See ? See why I made us get off the beach ? He would have been chasing everything that moves . That 's all because of this stuff you gave him ? Freslin 's an attractant . You can be attractive to someone else , or they can be attracted to you . It could be strong , weak , anything . Depends on where it 's manufactured . Did you like the Freslin I gave you last night ? Is this more ? Mmm . Different batch . Different quality . Want a taste ? Hmm ? Hmm ? Bring it on . It 's different . - More bitter ? Yeah . An animal 's last batch always is . This is , uh ... this is from an animal ? Mm-hmm . A beautiful animal . This is the same stuff that that guy sprayed on Chiana last night ? Yeah . Grade-A Freslin . Made in his own lab . Fe 'Tor 's got the most sensitive nose in the business . What am I missing ? Nothing . Here . Wonderful , isn 't it ? Yeah ... Now , will you do anything for me ? I 'll do anything for you . I think Fe 'Tor wants your females for more than just ... you know . What ... does he want them for ? No peeking . Can you smell it ? Just breathe it in . Well , the base element of Freslin is found in the senil gland of sentient beings . Oh , you mean like in people ? Yeah . Fe 'Tor 's got a machine that milks this gland . And when there 's a lot of demand , well , sometimes he 'll milk them until they die . You 'll love it . Can I open my eyes yet ? Mm-hmm . Oh ! Wow ! Why did you not tell us this earlier ? Ah ! John ... these people will not dance with me . No one wants to dance with me ... - No . Go away . Oh , oh , oh . Look at the booty on that girl . The booty ? - Whoo ! Sweetie pie ... I should have told you everything but I was scared . I mean , Fe 'Tor 's dangerous . If Fe 'Tor is so dangerous , why help us at all ? My mate , Sarl . He 's with Fe 'Tor . He doesn 't look very well . I mean , he 's tall , he 's good looking . I mean , look at me . I 'm a nothing . I tried to warn him , but ... I 'm telling you everything because when you save your females , I want you to save Sarl . Isn 't that the guy that was with Fe 'Tor last night ? Yeah . That 's Mitols , his right hand jerk . Well , he could probably get us in to see the girls , couldn 't he ? 'Course he can , but he 's never gonna to tell ya . Keep D 'Argo busy . I got some business . How you doin ' ? Man , were you here last night ? Was that wild or what ? I drink alone . Yeah , I 'm not really , uh ... interested in drinking , either . Um , I 'm looking for some , uh ... Freslin . And I heard that you were the guy to see . You like the Freslin ? Uh ... I , uh ... Shh ! - I ... Trust me . It only hurts the first time . Go away . Okay . Okay . Let me give you something . Look . I am loaded with currency , and I 'm looking for something a little special . And this is the only crap that I 've been able to find . And , uh ... Kabaah told me that you were the guy to see to get some really serious dren . If they drained that much fluid from her , Crichton , she would be dead . Shut up and let me tell my story . You really must relax . Struggle only makes it more painful . Hmm ? Mmm , that 's you you 're ingesting . Kabaah sent you . Why didn 't you say so ? I just did . Apex of the moon tonight , Fe 'Tor 's chamber . Know where it is ? I 'll find it . We 're auctioning some incredible dren . This 'll get you in . My frelling head is killing me from that spray , you little tralk ! D 'Argo , you can kill her later . Right now we gotta get the girls out of Fe 'Tor 's . So what are we doing here ? 'Cause I 'm going to help you , see ? I 'm going to make you a sorta disguise . Hey , Hammerhead ! How you doin ' ? I 'm back for some home video . Get out ! Get out ! I don 't think so . I need to see into Fe 'Tor 's compound . No . I won 't help you against him . Yes , you will or I 'm gonna snap your head off . Now I 'm gonna see the compound layout . You 're gonna show it to me . I don 't care if it 's empty , but you 're gonna show it to me now . Er , this is the auction room . Not bad . All it needs is a big screen TV . Ka D 'Argo . No , it ... it 's okay . That 's , um ... that 's Harvey . It 's not Scorpy . He 's a pookah . He 's ... he 's not real . But thanks to our unique shared consciousness in this situation , we finally get to meet Ka D 'Argo . Give me five . Go away . I 've had some weird conversations in my head before , but this is a little ... Yeah , I know . Hey look , Harvey just shows up every now and then to give me bad advice . And my suggestion to you both is to forget this folly . But since I know you won 't ... circuit breakers , to the entire subterranean level . Darkness may be of assistance to you . You know what , I think that 's not a bad idea . And the milking room you seek ? Ah . Down the hallway . Kabaah , show us the milking room . Raxil , what is that thing ? That 's where they drain the bodies to make the Freslin . Pleasure planet , my mivonks . We better count the steps in here . One ... two , three , four ... - two , three , four ... five , six , seven ... - five , six , seven ... eight , nine , ten . - eight . Ten steps . Uh , eight steps . - Ten . Eight . Small legs , human . Ow . Jool ? Jool ! Jool ? Something wrong ? No . No , no ... I was ... I was just trying to find Jool . We should really be going . You really are quite beautiful . Yeah . Where 's Jool ? Don 't be scared . Everything 's all right . No , I will not go to Fe 'Tor 's auction . He knows what I look like , so I won 't get in . - I 'll get you in . And you 're not spraying me with that stuff . I 'm not spending the rest of my life on the dance floor doing some ... - This Freslin will be different . No ! You are not ... - Shut up ! Just shut up ! I did not do everything , plan everything , so you could back out now ! Did you say plan ? - No , no , I didn 't mean plan . I make a plan , like , like , plan something ... Did you say that you planned this ? - No , no , no , I didn 't mean that , no , no . I got everything from the Transport Pod . Two pulse pistols , a pair of night-vision goggles , 200,000 in tiles so we can buy any Freslin we want . Uh , what did I miss ? Two guns ? You brought just two guns ? This little rodent has been lying to us . She said that she planned all this . Two guns ? ! I mean , I thought you were the great Crichton and D 'Argo . I mean , you blew up a shadow depository . I mean , I thought you 'd bring pulse rechargers , and a plasma bomb , and a really big gunship . But no , you bring nothing ! You bring two little weapons that wouldn 't kill a nik-nik ! You have heard of us ? Yeah , I 've heard stories , but obviously they aren 't worth a bucket of dren ! What the frell have you done to her ? Get her out of that thing , you fekik ! Chiana , she 's not in any pain . - Jool ? Jool ? Don 't worry . Eh ? Here . Enough with the dren ! You really shouldn 't waste the taste . Now I 'll let your friend rest , but I need to replace her with a new animal . Now I knew Fe 'Tor wouldn 't bother your females while you were in the bar , so I paid the blooming green girls to get you out of the way . Whoa , whoa , whoa , wait ! You let Fe 'Tor kidnap Chiana and Jool ? No , I didn 't help him . I just created a situation where everyone could ... Is there anything else you 're not telling us ? Nothing . Nothing . I promise . This little tralk has been lying to us all along . So what I suggest is ... Not again ! Please don 't hit me . Please don 't ... Ah ! All right , you can hit me just once . Just once ! Hello ? - What ! I 've got a live connection . The Nebari ... - Chiana ! They 've begun milking her . I think you 're going to be too late . I was right . You 're exceptional . Would you like a taste ? Drain as much as you can . Without damaging her value , of course . D 'Argo , you should check this out . D 'Argo ? Who the hell ... - Oh , you know ... the Freslin I sprayed him with radiateds his pheromones outwards and creates an aura morph , so we all see D 'Argo like this . I made him very attractive , don 't you think ? What are you talking about ? D 'Argo ? No more . Enough . Even I am not so gullible as to believe that D 'Argo turned into another creature . I do not appreciate the lies you tell in order to circumvent ... Whoa , ho ! Hold o ... How long we known each other ? Approximately two and a half long cycles . I ever lie to you ? Hmm ? Hmm ? D 'Argo looked totally different . Look at myself in the mirror , I ... And why does he not look that way now ? Metabolism . Look , man , let me ... Can I please tell the story the way I want to tell it ? Mitols is almost ready for the Nebari . What should I do about the other one ? Wring Curls . Drain till failure . She would only spoil the program . I am your host , but names are not important . Only currency . Well son , I 'm your buyer , and money ain 't important to me . Only quality . Know what I mean ? You 've come to the right auction , then . May I suggest the Nebari ? The finest I 've ever tasted . Right . Raxil . Alive still . I thought you 'd given the Freslin trade away , after your disaster on Ellapuria . Well , yeah , I did , lemme tell ya , but things change . Enjoy . Bid high . Excuse me . Do I know you ? Uh ... Hi . Ooh ... I ... I doubt it . I 've become a new man recently . I made him very attractive . Ooh ... 15,000 on my right . Have I any further bids ? 16,000 . 16,000 on my left . There . Any further bids ? Going once , twice , three times . Are you all done ? 16,000 . Sold for 16,000 brandaars . You traded Freslin ? Wait , wait , wait , wait . Years ago . Never killed anybody , non-event . Non-event , my ass . No , no , no , my point is , you must calm down . Increased oxygenation hastens the metabolism of the Freslin . It 's gonna wear off ? Not for awhile , not if he stays calm . Calm . Anger bad . D 'Argo , be cool , man . We buy the girls , Raxil 's mate if we can . No guns , no killing . And we 're outta here . I 'll watch you from up here . Distinguished friends , we now come to the sale you 've been waiting for . I present the olfactory genius , Heska Fe 'Tor . Does this guy just scream Vegas or what ? Heska Fe 'Tor . Friends , welcome . Thank you for coming at such short notice . What a fine auction this will be . May I present to you ... Chiana . Metabolism , Luxan . Bidding starts at 25,000 . 25,000 . 30,000 ! 40,000 ! 50,000 ! 55,000 ! 60,000 ! 85,000 ! What a wonderful bid , Heska Tenaco . Are there any others ? No ? 125,000 . 130 . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to take a closer look at the carcass . Be my guest . Hey , Pip , can you hear me ? Go away . What took you so long ? 150,000 . 151 . You mind cutting this heifer down so I can take a closer look ? Where 's Jool ? Milking Room . W - w-w-wait , is she yours ? Used to be . Look , you 've got Freslin boiling your brain . Everything you feel 's way out of whack . What 's going on down there on down there , that 's an act . He 's just pretending to be a buyer . 175 . 250 . One-quarter million brandars . Circuit breakers , for the entire subterranean level . I can double that bid if you give me some more time . No more time . Currency on hand . Top the bid now or step aside . Sold to Heska Tenaco for 250,000 brandars . Did you have to caress her whole body ? Oh , for cryin ' out loud ! - It 's just the Freslin . It makes him , ya know ... - Shut up ! Shut up ! Listen up , Mr. Horny Toad . Jool is still in the Milking Room . I 'm gonna hit the lights and get Chiana . Good . Good , good , good . We 'll get Jool and her mate . And then we 'll wait . And remember , ten steps down the hall . Eight steps , human . Don 't do anything till I hit the lights . No , no . Yeah , the lights . Good . This is all your fault ! If you hadn 't bribed those women in the bar ... Easy , Luxan , easy ! It 's the Luxan ! Security , move ! Frell . Don 't move ! Raise you fifty dollars . Chiana ! No , no , that 's not right . - No , it 's eight . - No , no , he said ten . Shut up , I know what I 'm talking about . It 's eight , you 're making me lose my place . Eight , eight , shut up ! - You 're wrong ! Okay , ten . Drop your weapon . Jool , are you okay ? Who is that ? That 's my mate . He 's dead . D 'Argo , save me ! Crichton . - D 'Argo . Where 's Raxil ? In there . The mate is dead . Right , meet you in the Pod . Raxil ! This is my honey . The brains to the machine ! My design ! He stole it , sold it . Fe 'Tor didn 't even know it was mine . Worth a fortune ! How 's your neck ? It 's fine . I don 't mind sticking it out for you . You don 't want these broken . You okay ? Yeah . Good . Weird . You ruined everything . Skree-tak ! You smell exotic . Smell this . Neck still okay ? Yeah . I knew it . Sad thing is , he 's gonna die happy . And that is what it was all about . Raxil . She was getting her chip back and she used us . She used us , man . So it is not our fault . I don 't believe you . Why not ? Too many inconsistencies . Too much obfuscation . Obfuscation ? How the hell does that translate ? Fine , you know what ? Look , you don 't wanna believe me , go ask the girls . Chiana and Jool are still sleeping off whatever it was they did , and I 'm not inclined to wake them . Pilot , I don 't think you 've understood me . Let me just start again . I ... - Crichton , no ! I have located another planet nearby . Industrial . Comms traffic indicates they have accommodations for visitors . You and D 'Argo are to be visitors . Pack what you need . We shall return for you in eight solar days . Pilot . It was real . Perhaps , John . However , Moya and I desire time away from your constant bickering . And this adventure , however embellished , does not alleviate that need . Um ... Get out of here . Okay . You know , you really should get out more . These things do happen . What , he didn 't believe you ? No . Well , what was that thing about a slim duck ? - Slam dunk . Whatever , it doesn 't matter . He 's throwing us off Moya . Yeah , well , you want to give it a go ? No . See , I did my best . Your best was to blow it . I did my best . - Well , you blew it . D 'Argo , he 's kicking us off Moya because we argue . He 's kicking us off Moya because you argue . No , we argue . - You argue . We . We argue . - You argue . Oh , we ... oh ! You would argue with a lamppost . - I do not . Open the door . You open it . - You open the door . What , you 're a girl ? I 'm going to open the door for you ? Open the door . I 'm older than you , show some respect . - You can open the door . - I 'm not opening the door . - Well then I 'll just ... - You open it .

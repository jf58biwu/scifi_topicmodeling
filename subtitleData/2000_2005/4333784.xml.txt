 Cleo 's gonna be sorry she passed on this one . You know , she could really use some color on those pasty , white legs of hers . It 's not the color she needs as much as the vitamin D. Poor thing doesn 't get as much surface exposure as she used to . Well , speaking of exposure , you will excuse me , won 't you ? Is it party time already ? Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah . Oh , you know what ? Everybody looks better with a tan . Hi , boys . Don 't screw with me , buddy . You still owe me for 20 kilojoules of shine . Now pay up . I 'd love to , but I got a rule about being ripped off . What 's your rule on having your face ripped off ? Is that anything we need to get into ? No , just your run-of-the-mill testosterone flare-up . Oh ! What ... You know , these guys are starting to become a real royal pain in my thrusters . That 's it . What do you say we teach these guys some manners ? Or at least put them back into their corners . Guys , come on ! Let 's just stop this before somebody gets hurt . Oh , come on ! Come on , guys , stop now and nobody gets hurt . The forecast isn 't looking so sunny anymore , is it ? Huh . What do you say we get out of here ? Yeah , just get my shine specs . What the ... Hel ... Tell me you ordered that . Oh . Very funny . Okay . Um , uh , can I have your attention , everybody ? Did anybody lose , um , a baby ? Uh ? Anybody ? A what ? What 's that ? How about you , mister ? Baby ? Not my problem . Oh , I don 't believe this . Oh . He must have belonged to that guy that was escorted out . Oh , Sarge , I think we should keep him . No . No . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home .

At last , a Betrayer head ! Hurry up and download it . Let 's see what this baby 's made of . Come on . Get Sluggo . He 's gonna want to see this . Mauser , do I look fat ? Cleo , I 'm not programmed for weight estimation . Do you hear that ? Mauser , can you whip me up a new set of eardrums , please ? Is that what I think it is ? Mmm-hmm . A baby , how cute . Oh ! May I ? Do you have experience with infants ? Who needs experience ? We 're wired to take care of babies . It 's called maternal instinct . Mmm . Boy or girl ? I don 't know . We found it at the tanning saloon . Daddy bought a one-way ticket to the bottom of the shaft . What 's wrong with you ? Show some humanity . Mauser , can you post a hologram of the baby on all the underground boards ? We 'll take care of it until we can find a proper guardian . What ? Oh , we could ... Oh ! It 's a boy . Hi . Someday you 'll be showing that off every chance you get . Now go to your Uncle Mauser . Hel , the lab is no place for a child . Voice , I couldn 't very well leave it with the man that threw his father down the shaft . His presence may interfere with operations . I 'm sure we could spare a day to find any living relatives . Hel , you know nothing about taking care of a child . I have maternal instincts . Besides , Cleo 's still alive , isn 't she ? Could someone please shut that thing up ! Hold on to your thong . I may know just the thing that 'll hush him up . Something that my mom used to sing to me . Let 's hear it . " Rock-a-bye , baby " " On the treetop " " When the wind blows " " The cradle will rock " " When the bough " Oh ! " bough breaks " " The cradle will fall " How is that helping ? Shh . " And down will come the little boy sweetie pie " " Cradle and all " Incredible . But we 're running out of time . If we don 't get our hands on that baby soon , it will be worthless . He was picked up by a Voice team , all female . I 'll bet it 's one of those girlies that gave me this ! Get everybody together . Now ! Yes , sir . I gotta go with Voice on this one . It 's not our duty to pick up strays . He 's a baby , not an alley cat . It 's not about duty , Sarge . If we don 't aid in the survival of our own kind , we 'll just suffer the consequences at the hands of the Bailies . Wait a minute . Something 's not right here . It 's been quiet a whole 20 minutes . Oh . See , Sarge , babies aren 't so bad , are they ? Have you ever heard the expression that good things come in small packages ? Yeah , well , not all good things . You know , I 've got to admit , he 's awfully cute when he 's asleep . Do I hear somebody 's biological clock ticking ? Clock ? Actually , I hear something , too . Oh , my God ! Where 'd he go ? Oh , man . Baby ? Where 'd he go ? Sweetie ? There he is . Oh , he 's got Sarge 's gauntlet . Sarge , how could you leave something like that laying around ? Oh , I 'm sorry . It didn 't quite occur to me to baby-proof the weapons closet . Oh . Honey ... Oh . You give that nasty gauntlet to Auntie Cleo , okay ? Come on , baby . Hel , what 's going on ? No problem , Voice . Everything 's under control . Easy , boy . Give me that . Hel , the child 's guardians have responded . You 're to meet them at the tanning saloon as soon as possible . What are we waiting for ? Let 's go . Oh ... Incoming , and it doesn 't look good . Oh . You found it ! Come home to Mama , precious . How can we ever repay you for returning him to us ? You can start by showing us your guardian tags . Guardian tags ? We , uh , we forgot ' em . All right , charade 's over . What do you want with this baby ? Stay down ! They 're Gandarans . Who ? Gandarans , deep-level dwellers . I mean , deep and dark , that 's why they 're so pale . They can 't take heat or light . Sarge , what do you say we make them sweat ? Sounds good . You stay here . Uhh ! Oh ! You 're really hot for me , aren 't you ? Start talking or we bring you to a full boil . No , you don 't understand . We 're all in danger as long as that kid 's breathing . What do you have against this baby ? It 's not just a baby . It 's a Bailey bomb . You 're telling me this baby 's a bomb ? And he 's going to explode ? We found a Betrayer head in the shaft this morning . It contained information about this baby . Team , I did a routine scan on the infant 's hologram . I discovered something you should know . The baby 's a bomb ? Precisely . How did you know ? Hel , that fight at the tanning saloon earlier must have been a Betrayer setup . Right , they were counting on our maternal instincts to do us in . The child 's been injected with a synthetic gene mutation . The gene is replicating cells with a high-energy enzyme . Once they are outnumbered , there is a chain reaction . Talk about a baby boom . Something tells me our friendly neighborhood bartender was in on this and what a coincidence , he 's nowhere to be found . So what exactly do you want with an exploding infant ? To deactivate him and take him back to Sluggo . A Bailey-designed explosive will be worth a fortune on the black market . Sluggo , huh ? How do we deactivate him ? The only way to stop the cells from replicating ... Kill him . Can 't we get a second opinion ? At this rate of cellular growth , you have approximately eight minutes . Oh , um ... You know , m-my arms are getting a little tired . Hand him over . Hel , bring the child to the surface to avoid any damage to the underground . I 'm not gonna stand by and let this happen . It 's out of your hands , Hel . No , Voice . I think we have things well in hand . Got a plan ? Mmm-hmm . Sluggo got his information from a Betrayer head . I 'm sure that same head has details on how to save this baby . Well , looks like there 's only one way to do this . So , gorgeous , we need directions . I should lobotomize you . Do you have any idea what we can gain from the Bailey technology inside that kid ? I want that bomb ! Looks like we 're coming up on the Gandaran Quadrant . Looks like the Gandaran Quadrant 's coming up on us . Cleo , catch ! Oh ! Hel , Sarge ! Sarge , bouncing baby boy coming your way ! Got him . Roughly three minutes remaining . Two more levels . Hang in there , kiddo . Back off ! Baby ? The kid 's still alive ! Let 's get out of here ! Sluggo , you 've really let yourself go . I 'm twice the man I used to be . Why don 't you just give me the kid ? I 'll make it worth your while . Besides , you 'll never save it in time . I 'm not so sure about that . Mauser , I found the malignant cells . Now what ? Locate the original gene sequence . You 'll know it when you see it . Oh , he 's burning up . That 's my cue ! Have a blast , girlies ! Sluggo . A little something to remember me by . I will get even with you , blondie ! Just wait ! How much time do we have ? One minute . Hel , get the team out of there . I 'm not going anywhere , but Sarge and Cleo can leave if they want to . No way . Please . Mauser , I found the original cell . Great . You just had to be heroes . That 's what we do . Transfer the cells to the surgical template of the healing tube . Come on . Cleo , load the baby ! Where ? Over there . Huh ? Okay , let 's do this . Twenty seconds . Bye , sweetie . It 's working . Ten seconds . It 's not working fast enough . That 's it , big boy . Keep backing up . Five , four , three , two , one . Hel , what 's your status ? Oh , sweetie . Repeat . Hel , what is your status ? Sarge ... We 're fine . All four of us are just fine . Yay ! Yay ! Let 's get out of here . This way . Wow . Looks like junior here scared off everybody . There 's not a sign of life for miles . You know , I have to say , I 'm really proud of the two of you for sticking in there through all of this . Well , I 'm proud of you , too . Oh ? Yeah . You 're all tough warriors on the outside , but you make pretty kick-butt mommies , too . But we won 't argue with you there . Like we 'd let anything happen to this little goober . Oh ! Excuse me , ladies , there is someone who is desperately awaiting your return : the baby 's real parents . Well , you tell them that their little man is doing great , and we 're gonna get him back to them real soon . Yeah . Are you ready to go for a ride ? Oh , yeah . Subtitles subxpacio and TusSeries

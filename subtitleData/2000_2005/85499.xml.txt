Cut off from the world , knowing neither hope nor despair the land breathed an air of quiet stagnation . Reformers driven to armed rebellion had been suppressed by the State . The House of Takemikazuchi were assassins hired to suppress the rebels . From ancient times they had been guards to the rulers of a neighboring kingdom . That country , modernizing , had overthrown its monarch . Driven into exile , they had reached this land . Now they were a tribe of assassins who would kill anyone they were paid to . The Takemikazuchi ... Mother ... Byakurai wants you . Anka fled this morning . He who flees the Takemikazuchi is a traitor who will sell our secrets . He 's headed across Shikon Mountain . But with his leg , he won 't have reached the old mine yet . Yuki take Kiri with you . I 'll go alone . I 'll go ! He 'll slow me down . Take me with you ! Byakurai told you to ! Could you really kill Anka ? Yes . What if he begged ? I 'd still kill him ! I don 't think so . Yuki ... it 's you ... I 'm unarmed . Don 't kill me . Please ... Take my sword . Tell them you killed me , OK ? I see I 'm no match for you any more , Yuki . - Who are you ? My name is Kuka . I served your mother . I have something to tell you . It 's about who killed your mother . You were told she died in an attack but it was Byakurai who killed her . Liar ! - Byakurai killed your mother Azora Princess Takemikazuchi . You must either take revenge and succeed to your mother 's place or leave . Tomorrow you turn 20 . On that day a princess assumes leadership of the Takemikazuchi . You must choose either to take over the House or to leave it . If you choose to leave , come to the old mine . I have delivered the message of Azora . Did Anka beg for his life ? Did my mother beg for hers ? What do you mean ? Your voice is shaking . Your mind 's racing . Are you aware what you 're doing ? Tell me . Byakurai ... did you kill my mother ? No . Put up your sword , Yuki . I 'll overlook this . I didn 't want to tell you . Your mother was killed because she meant to betray us and flee . Liar ! Lashing out won 't help ! I have no choice . Die ! Wonderful news from the Union Assembly . Under our Great Leader , we are winning the production war . The Ministry of Consumption reports living standards have risen 20 per cent over the past year . Celebrating this news the citizens have come out into the streets in a spontaneous parade . Aya ? What is it ? Is this to kill me with ? You 're a Takemikazuchi , aren 't you . Who hired you ? Talk . Where are the others ? There 's no one else coming . I 'm not here to kill you . Liar . You think I believe that ? Trust me . Trust you ? You guys kill anyone you 're paid to . If I trust you I 'll end up dead . If I was after you you 'd be dead now . Trust me ? Doesn 't that hurt ? - Yes if you let it . I saw a girl . Where is she ? I 'm alone here . That 's my bed . - Good night . We lost her at the road through the Forest Zone . You came back to tell me that ? No . Someone saw a truck . We 'll watch the road . She 'll be back . She wants revenge . Someone told her . - Who ? Hmm ... Yuki 's 20 today . Whoever told her about Azora knew that , and what it means . Kuka ... So you think she wants to kill you to avenge Azora ? That means she 'll come here . If Kuka wanted to talk to Yuki , where would he call her to ? To his home ? I 'd find a better place than that . How have you been ? It 's Kidokoro . I 'm back . There 's something I want to talk to you about . I 'll come today . ' No . I 'll come to you the day after tomorrow . Roger . I 'll be waiting at the usual place . A man had pledged with Azora , heir to the House of Takemikazuchi . He swore fealty to the House but Byakurai framed him as a traitor and killed him . That man was my father ? You wouldn 't remember . You 'd only just turned two . There were still many of Takemikazuchi blood . Byakurai sought to marry Azora himself and make the House of Takemikazuchi his . But Azora refused . Discouraged , she sought to bring the Takemikazuchi to an end . Byakurai found out and killed her . Then everything changed . Many were unhappy with Byakurai , and tried to leave . But only very few managed to escape . Princess Azora was killed here . I 'm sure she hoped you would leave the Takemikazuchi . She wanted you to succeed where she had failed . You need not take revenge on Byakurai . The fate of the Takemikazuchi is to disappear . Princess Yuki ... Your mother had been tortured almost to death but the final blow came from me . Kill me if you will . My life since then has been one of waiting for this day . I offered to accompany her to the next world but she wouldn 't allow it . I was commanded to tell you everything when you reached 20 years of age . If Princess Yuki were to do me the honor of killing me ... Don 't say that . There 's no point . So it was you , Kuka ... Soma ... My , how you 've grown ! By your leave ... Kuka ! This is what I wanted ! Princess Yuki ! Don 't die ! Kill me if you want but don 't raise your blades against Princess Yuki ! That I can 't promise . Kuka ! When I was small I was always happy . I never dreamed things would turn out like this . You know why people thought that way then ? It 's because no one had any ideals . Yes , people died when we put a bomb in the Assembly . But it was very effective . You should be proud . It was a holiday . No one was supposed to be there . You told me that . Losses are inevitable . You don 't get something for nothing . Mimura knew that . His death wasn 't wasted . No one pays any attention unless a few dozen citizens die . I 'd like to move on to the next project . Mr Sugimoto didn 't think so . He called you while I was gone ? Last month . He 's been expelled . I trust you . We have to do whatever 's necessary to achieve our ideals . Takashi what 's the safest place in the jungle ? On the lion 's back . The fleas there enjoy the most peaceful life there is . Hey ... Hey ... Hey ! Shit ! Where are you bleeding ? You need protein , or you won 't heal . Put these on . That 's all there is here . Hurry up ! It suits you . What are you doing ? Throwing these out . You saw Mr Kidokoro ? You saw Mr Kidokoro ? Takashi ... be careful of him . Did you hear about Sugimoto ? Did you hear about Sugimoto ? He 's dead . Murdered . I 'm leaving this country . There 's happiness somewhere . You just have to go there . Who 's that ? A guest . A guest ? So you 've found happiness ? Take care . Call me if you want to come . Thanks . Why did you come back ? What 's happened now ? Don 't want to say ? It 's probably safer for me if I don 't know . Does it bother you to kill someone ? Why do you kill people ? For money ? My body moves . When I hold my sword and close in on a target , my body just moves before I can think why . Aw , you poor dear ! Some king stops paying his guards so they put their skills on the market . You kill people for no reason . Not to defend your country , not to defend yourselves ... You have nothing to defend . You just kill . But I had a reason . I had a reason . I 'm sure I had a reason to kill . Come with me . My sister . When she was eight I came home from school to find blood everywhere and just her alive . The guys who did it were let off for lack of evidence . So I killed them myself . I was caught , tried , and sentenced . Four years later when I got out , I couldn 't see things the way I had before . Everything looked completely different . Then I met someone who said he wanted me to be as happy as I 'd been before . No one else said that . I 've done things , and been pushed into doing things . To get back to being happy , I 've rationalized everything . Renkyo ? Yes . I need to talk to you . About what ? Can we really kill Yuki ? Without her , we have no leader of Takemikazuchi blood . And then ... - Then what ? We 've already lost just about everyone of Takemikazuchi blood . But what reason do we have to exist without that name ? - We don 't need a reason . Now we have nothing left to guard any more . I venerated our ancestors , I believed in the motherland . But when the monarchy fell our swords were taken from us . Those who were caught had their memories erased with drugs and to slow their arms needles driven into their elbows . We fled , without turning our swords on the motherland . Remember , Renkyo ? Those tanks on that southern island we saw as we went ? A group of ruined tanks all eaten away by acid rain and stinking of corpses . But there were no corpses . The stench was coming from us . At that time we were dead . Hello ? Hello ? - It 's me . Mr Kidokoro ... Why are you phoning ? I sent you a schematic . Can you take a look at it ? Sure . Be right back . Did you see it ? I want to move in ten days . Are you there ? Ten days ... I can 't . OK , when ? Never . No ? No . All right . I 'll be in touch . You always look so sad ... And you have no expression at all . Have you ever been sad ? I make it go away . Just like pain . And that 's how you can kill people ? When you 're sad you should grieve , and when you 're happy , celebrate . Have you ever laughed ? When I 'm sad I grieve . For hours ... For days ... For years ... Have you ever heard of a miki-ishi ? No . It means ' beautiful precious stone ' . They 're rare . You can look all year and be lucky to find even one . When you grind it on a whetstone , you get a little green crystal . My mother collected them . When she found one , she 'd carefully polish and save it . When she had 30 , she was going to make a necklace for my wedding day . She said she 'd put it around my neck the day I got married . She started collecting them at 18 had me at 22 and died at 27 . ... and died at 27 . ... in a little treasure box . Not enough for a necklace . Soon I 'll pass the age she was when she had me and then her age when she died . But I haven 't collected anything I could leave to anyone . I don 't have anyone to leave anything to . There 's no one I feel like I want to treasure . Let 's leave here leave this country . There 's nothing holding us here . Somewhere there must be a place we can forget everything . Let 's go there . Mother now I 'm happy . You think you 'll ever be happy ? Even if you kill me , you still walk the path of blood . You can 't avoid it . Mr Kidokoro ... Your sister looks well . What do you want ? Oh ... If it 's about that schematic ... No . I changed plans . This one 's a great idea . I 'm sure you 'll like it . What is it ? We find common ground with the government . We achieve our ideals , and very few people get hurt . What do you think , Takashi ? Good plan , huh ? You 're selling me out ? It 's a deal . We respect the law , and our ideals are realized . Traitor ! In spirit we will continue . The plan I sent you was to be the last . Because we 'd all be killed ? Don 't talk like that ! Isn 't that what you 've wanted all along anyway ? But this way you 're safe . I said it was a deal ! A fair deal . So why did we do all that ? Why all those victims ? ! It meant something . We all acted because we believed in our ideals . No . We believed in you ! No . We believed in you ! ... Mimura blown up ... They all believed in you ! You said we 'd be happy again . You 're the only one who did ! Happiness will come . Of course it won 't be free . I told you the price would be high . All we can do is pray for the victims . But you don 't have to pray , Takashi . You 're one of the victims we 'll be praying for . You bastard ! I am Azora 's daughter Princess Yuki of the Takemikazuchi . In the name of my mother , I take your life ! Don 't you understand ? It 's over ! Get lost ! I 'll keep this . Live . Be happy . Live for me . Takashi ... Takashi ...

 Godfellas - Space pirates ! - Space pirates ? You know , pirates , but in space . Avast , mateys . Electronically transfer your space doubloons afore I send thee to Davey Jarg 's locker ! Hey ! Keep it down , you kids ! I 'm trying to take a nap ! Come on . Come on . Make Bender take a nap in a tube . Come back when I 've had some sleep , baby . Fry to battle stations . Fire torpedo three . Firing torpedo number three . That 's not torpedo three ! Not at all ! Damn you , Fry and Lee ... la ! Too late I realize that me children are me only real treasures . Help ! Mechanical man overboard ! Go after him , Leela . We were going full speed when we fired him so he 's going faster than that . We can 't catch him even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood ? I don 't know how to say this but Bender is doomed to drift through space . Forever . He always wanted to drift forever but through the American Southwest . I 'm going too fast . I 've gotta lose momentum . I 'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag . Hey universe , check out the dude with the Rolex . Wow , ostentatious . Except what good is a candelabra without ... ? Wait , I know . Ah , the pity . Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity 's plaything . Oh , cruel fate , to be thusly boned . Ask not for whom the bone bones . It bones for thee . The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art . Damn you ! Now , when I 'm found in a million years , people will know what the score was . Hey , what 's bombarding me ? Oh , no , an asteroid field . If even a pea-sized asteroid goes through my skull it could hurt slightly . Well , that was fun . Now for eons of loneliness . Fellow Shrimpkins , behold him that hath taken us onto his breast . Holy frijoles . All bow before the great Metal Lord . Worshipers ? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage . - All hail the Metal Lord . - So hailed . Those peewees think I 'm God , huh ? Hard to blame them . - I am the Metal Lord . Who are you ? - I am called Malachi . It means " He who really loves the Metal Lord . " Listen here , time for a religious donation . Hand over your wallet ! But we are a poor and simple folk . Poor ? Oh , crap ! Pity me not , for I am richened by the love of my family . - What art thou doing , Malachi Jr . ? - I 'm practicing to hug Daddy . Gag unto me with a spoon . It 's time I laid down a few commandments . You got a chisel ? Take this down . Number one ... Behold , the one commandment : Make it a double ! - Can you find him , professor ? - The Smell-a-Scope isn 't strong enough . Bender 's odor is so mild , it 's being overpowered by local sources . Hooray ! People are paying attention to me . Fry , we brought someone to cheer you up . His name is Helper . He is eager to be your new best friend . Hello , chum . Miss your buddy ? - Have a pudding pop . - No , I ... - Want to go to an amusement park ? - Well , okay . - Have fun . Hey , I heard Bender 's back . - What ? Really ? No . I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment . Microbrewed . My guys did all right . I think I 'll make my countenance to shine down upon them . Good work . There 's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight . - Yes , tonight is kind of special . - Did you rip off your arm as a joke ? Nay . Like most of your followers , I was maimed building the great brewery . Others died from the fumes it spewed forth . And , of course , the liquor industry attracted organized crime . It 's all my fault . Malachi , tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight . - Malachi Jr . ! No ! - Daddy , I can 't hold much longer . - My arms are tired from hugging . - Save him . Save my son , Metal Lord . This looks like a job for God . What the ... ? Malachi , what manner of deal is this with the chanting ? They saw you save my son . Now everyone prays for their own miracles . Very well . What do they want ? The people of that village pray for wealth . That was a practice miracle . Who 's next ? They pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer . Very well . Let there be light . - Yippee ! - Hooray ! I got it . I got it . When you 're writing the Bible , you might want to omit that last miracle . He decided not to let go . I can 't believe you 're gone . I won 't ! If I can 't reach you physically , I 'll try something crazy . That 's my story , Father Changstein el Gamahl . - Can religion help me find my friend ? - We could join together in prayer . - But is there anything useful we can do ? - No . Sure , I hold s√©ance , channel your friend . No problem . Insert coin . I am your friend , Bonder . - Bonder ? Is it really you ? - Yes . I am fine . Give the gypsy $ 1 0 . Wait , Bender 's name isn 't Bonder , it 's Bender . You 're a fraud . - You want false hope or not ? - Only if there 's no real hope . There is perhaps one way . Have you heard of the Monks of the Shubah ? - I 've not heard of them . - They are an ancient order that believes God exists in the depths of space . They have built a powerful radio telescope high in the Himalayas to search for him . - They 'd let me use it to find Bender ? - What am I , psychic ? I mean , yes . I 'm sure they will . Yes . Oh , Metal Lord , hear my prayer ! Yes , Malachi . What is it this time ? The infidels on your back no longer believe in you . They say their prayers go unheeded . How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass ? They talk of war against the faithful . I beseech thee , rise up against them . Smite someone who deserves it for once . Every time I interfere , I only make things worse . - It 's best to solve your own problems . - But Metal Lord ... What part of nay doesn 't thou understand ? I 'm outfitting an expedition to the Himalayas . I 'll need a coat . I miss Bender almost half as much as you do , but it 's hopeless . You can 't give up hope just because it 's hopeless . You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go : - I 'd also like a pack mule ! - At once , sir ! Well , you won 't listen to reason so I 'll listen to idiotic-ness and come too . But we 'll need a Sherpa to guide us . Now that 's one Bible that doesn 't disappoint . Looks like society 's running pretty well without my meddling in ... Atomic bombs ? Those unbelievers from my backside found my nuclear pile . Fear not , Lord . We shall be with you soon . This is the maximum level of being with me ! We will solve our own problems . It is time to convert the unbelievers . - Convert them ? - To radioactive vapor ! Look , Daddy , I 'm hugging God . Maybe if I hug him real hard , he 'll save us from ... No ! Oh , it tickles . Hello ? Is anyone still alive ? How about in the porno theater ? Don 't be embarrassed . They 're dead . All dead . Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences ? If I die of exhaustion , make sure my body freezes in a dignified position . None of that " huddled for warmth " crap . Behold ! The monastery of the Shubah . I must leave . I am not holy enough to enter . Okay . Looks rickety . We 'd better test it . Welcome to our monastery . Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by . Hey ! That galaxy 's signaling in binary . I 've gotta signal back ! But I only know enough binary to ask for the bathroom . Speak English ? I do now . What are you , a galactic computer ? Possible . I am user-friendly , my good chum . - Who built you ? - I have always been . Oh , my God ! Are you God ? Possible . I do feel compassion for all living things , my good chum . But why would God think in binary ? Unless you 're not God but the remains of a computerized space probe that collided with God ! That seems probable . A member of our brotherhood sits at the controls constantly scanning the heavens for God . There he is ! No . No , wait . No . - How long have you been at it ? - 700 years . We 've not yet examined one ten-millionth of the sky . We will find the Almighty , even if it takes to the end of time . - And then what ? - Then we utter unto him a short prayer . See , the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter . - Like a giant karaoke machine ? - Not really . - Want to see our giant karaoke machine ? - Not really . Finding God , that 's important but it might be a treat if you let me use the telescope to find my friend . I don 't know what to say , other than absolutely not ! - Your loss is tragic , but our work ... - You can look for God forever . I 'm just asking for one lifetime to find my friend ! He speaks out of love for his friend . Perhaps that love is God . How convenient . A theory about God that doesn 't require a telescope . Get back to work ! That telescope is as much mine as anybody 's ! I 'll use it with or without permission ! Your order may be famous for martial arts , but I can clobber any holy man . Actually , we only practice martial arts as meditation . We are strictly nonviolent . Then get in the laundry room , or I 'll kick your butts ! Oh , this is the worst crazy sect I 've ever been in . Do you know what I 'll do before I do it ? - Yes . - What if I do something different ? - Then I don 't know that . - Cool , cool . - A lot of people pray to you , huh ? - Yes , but so many ask so much after a while , you just tune it out . You know , I was God once . Yes , I saw . You were doing well until everyone died . It was awful . I tried helping them . I tried not helping them . In the end , I couldn 't do any good . Do you think what I did was wrong ? Right and wrong are words . What matters is what you do . Yeah , I know . That 's why I asked if what I did ... Oh , forget it . Bender , being God isn 't easy . Do too much , people get dependent . If you do nothing , they lose hope . You must use a light touch , like a safecracker or a pickpocket . Or a guy who burns a bar for insurance money ! Yes , if you make it look like an electrical thing . When you do things right , people won 't be sure you 've done anything at all . Does that mean you wouldn 't send me to Earth , even if I prayed ? Earth ? Which way is that ? I don 't know . Bender ? Bender ? Let us out ! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them . Now we 're bored ! - Has anyone out there seen Bender ? - No ! Quit asking ! It 's been three days . Even if you stay the rest of your life there is virtually no chance of finding him . It 's time to give up . You 're right . I 'm never gonna see him again . I know he was evil , and on more than one occasion he actually stole my blood . But still , I wish I had Bender back . I wish I had Bender back ! Huh ? - What ? You say something ? - No . No . Well , so long . Remember what we talked about . Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Bender ! It 's a miracle ! This is , by a wide margin , the least likely thing ever to happen . You 'll never believe what happened ! First , I was God . Then I met God ! - We locked up some monks ! - Oh , no ! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room ! Do we have to ? They 're monks . Their God will let them out or give them more shoes to eat . - Fat chance ! You can 't count on God for jack ! He pretty much told me so ! Now come on ! If we don 't save those monks , no one will ! When you do things right , people won 't be sure you 've done anything at all .

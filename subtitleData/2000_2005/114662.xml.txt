 Mr. Popper , what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom ? - I 'm sorry , sir . - Yes , well ... ... you 're barely passing my class as it is , Mr. Popper . - It won 't happen again , sir . - For your sake , I hope not . I turned it off . I know I did . They know you know . They 're coming for you . Get out . Get out now ! You are in serious trouble , Mr. Popper . Stop right there ! Mr. Popper . Oh , my God , you freak ! - Get out of here ! - Get out of here ! You 're not a girl . Neo , I believe . I know it wasn 't a dream . This is not real . And the real world lies somewhere else . A typical mental delusion . We get unbalanced kids like this all the time . Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people . This world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that . It 's called denying reality . It 's , you know , just a self-defense mechanism for those type of kids . Well , he 's in another world now . Make no mistake about that . His vitals are good . He 's gonna make it . It 's unbelievable . I didn 't think self-substantiation was possible . Apparently , it is . Neo . It 's okay . You 're safe now . I knew ... ... you 'd save me . I didn 't save you , kid . You saved yourself . Subtitles by SDI Media Group ENGLISH

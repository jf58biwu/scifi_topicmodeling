 [ Humming ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] Hey , now we 're talking . Hey . Right here , man , right here ! Hey , come on ! Stop , you son of a ... You know , you got , like , highway hypnosis or something . You didn 't see me standing there , yelling , waving ? You better watch that . [ Music On Headphones ] [ Air Brakes Hissing ] Oh , come on . What now ? Where 's everybody going ? Is , is the toilet broken ? What ? Can someone please tell me what 's going on here ? [ Grunts ] [ Gasping ] No . No ! No ! [ Beeping ] Damn . [ Sighs ] [ Phone Rings ] - John Doggett . - Hey , it 's Scully . Good morning . Good afternoon . I 've been trying to reach you . Well , actually , I 'm out of town . I 'm north of Sugarville , Utah , roughly . Utah ? What are you doing there ? The , uh , local coroner wants a consultation on a murder victim ... A man who was found beaten to death in the desert . Apparently , his corpse shows some anomalous characteristics . Anomalous ? How ? From what they 're telling me , he is a 22-year-old backpacker who was last seen by his family about six months ago in perfect health . However , his body is now showing advanced signs of osteoporosis arthritis and kyphosis of the vertebrae . In other words , he 's got a spine of a 90-year-old woman . Sounds anomalous , all right . You didn 't need me to tag along ? Well , it was just a , uh , simple consultation ... and , uh ... he called me over the weekend and I fiigured I wasn 't going to bother you . Well , if there 's anything I can do from here . Well , there might be , if you don 't mind . Somewhere in our filles ... there is an unsolved murder case . Unfortunately , I , uh , don 't remember any of the particulars like where or when it took place but I do remember that there were some glycoproteins found at the crime scene . " " Glycoproteins . " Yeah , mucous ... but it was , uh , unable to be identifiied , and seeing as how you , uh , recently read through all of our filles I thought maybe it would ring a bell with you . Well , I don 't have a great memory for mucous ... but I 'll be happy to look . Remember anything else ? Agent Scully ? - Agent Scully ? - I 'm sorry ? Do you remember anything else ? No , no , just , uh , just mucous . Look , when you fiind that fille , will you fax it over to the Juab County Sheriff s offiice ? That 's the best place to reach me . - My cell phone doesn 't seem to be working out here . - All right , you got it . Thank you . Hello ? [ Horn Honks ] - How you doing ? - Good . Thanks . I , uh , I was wondering . A bus came through here a little while ago . Uh , do you happen to know where it might have gone ? Well , I was around back . Do you know what 's up that road ? Eventually it 'll get you to Salt Lake ... I mean , if you 're not in too much a hurry . Can I ask what happened to your hand ? I was changing the blade on my bow saw . It 's kind of gross . Yeah . There was a murder out here last week about 15 , 20 miles off the state road . Did you hear about it ? Yes , I did . It 's scary . Yeah . Well , you 're going to want to wash this out . Put some iodine on it . You don 't want it to get infected . You sound like my mother . Well , I also sound like a doctor . - Medical doctor ? - Yeah . Can you sell me some gas ? Oh . Oh , I 'd love to ... but I 'm all out . See , the tanker was supposed to be here yesterday but ... well , I 'm hoping for this afternoon . How low are you ? I got a ... quarter tank , I think . I 'll make it . It 's all right . I 'd feel awful bad if you didn 't . Hang on . Thanks . Should be enough in here to tide you over . Oh , that 's great . Thank you . Do me a favor . Don 't go telling people that I 'm giving away free gas back here . Where is " " here , " exactly ? 'Cause I can 't seem to fiind this town on the map . Oh , we 're not really a town . Just a ... just a few like-minded people trying to keep the modern world at bay . You 're good to go . Thank you very much . [ Engine Starts ] Help is coming . [ Engine Sputtering ] Okay . Hey . Excuse me . You put something in my tank that killed my engine . What ? Where 's that gas can ? I 'd like to see it , please . That 's water . I barely even smell any gasoline . Oh , God , you 're right . I 'm sorry . I ... I left it out . It must have gotten rain in it . Oh , and it rains a lot here , does it ? Seeing as how it 's basically the desert . I 'm really sorry . Yeah . I 'm going to use your phone . I don 't have one . You don 't have a phone . So how did you call up the tanker that was supposed to come here yesterday ? There 's a phone up the street . Mr. Milsap 's place . He 'll help you out . Hello ? Hello ? - Hi . - Hi . - Mr. Milsap ? - Can I help you ? Yes , I hope so . My car has stalled up the street and I was wondering if I could use your phone . Sure . It 's in here . The line 's dead . Oh , no . Let me see . Damn phone company . They 're updating the lines , so the service gets interrupted . It 'll come back on . How long ? Ten minutes ... two hours ... I could say , but I 'd just be guessing . You 're welcome to wait here . I could even give you a room if you like . This was a boarding house . I won 't be here that long . - What the hell is going on here ? - Sorry ? I get the distinct impression that somebody doesn 't want me to leave . I don 't know anything about that . A bus came through here about an hour ago . Where did it go ? A bus ? Don 't tell me you didn 't see it . Oh , I think I 'd have known if a big bus came through . Are you sure I can 't help you out with a room ? It 's 18 miles to the state road . Another 20 to Sugarville . You don 't want to walk it . [ Sighs ] Excuse me . Ma 'am , excuse me . Ma 'am . Excuse me , ma 'am . Hello ? Ma 'am , I need some help . Hello ? Hello ? [ Sighs ] [ Knocking ] [ Milsap ] Doctor , can I speak to you ? It 's ... it 's an emergency . I 'm sorry to bother you . There 's a man downstairs that needs help . Please . Let go . Don 't hold him down . How long has he been seizing ? Uh , three ... four minutes . It 's okay . You 're all right . You 're okay . What 's his name ? He 's a stranger . He needed help . Wha ... what 's wrong with him ? He had a grand mal seizure . As far as I can tell , he 's in status . It 's a continuous seizure state . He doesn 't smell like acetone which would indicate that he 's hyperglycemic and he doesn 't appear to have any head injuries . He could be epileptic and just ceased taking his medication . How did this happen ? Uh-huh . At any rate , we need to get him to a hospital . Immediately . I assume that your phone 's still not working . Sorry . Well , do you or one of your friendly neighbors happen to have a car ? No one here has a car . No cars ? We could send someone to the state road on foot . All right ? We could get them to bring back help . In the meantime , please , anything you can do for him . All right , do you ... do you have any Karo syrup ? Any corn syrup ? Yeah . [ Phone Ringing ] Juab County Sheriff s Offiice , Sheriff Ciolino speaking . Hi , this is Agent John Doggett with the FBI . I have some material my partner , Agent Scully , requested . What 's your fax number there ? Agent Doggett , when 's your partner going to get here , by the way ? The murder victim 's family 's waiting for us to turn the body over . Agent Scully 's not there ? She 's supposed to be there yesterday . Yes , sir , that was our understanding . Sheriff , could I trouble you to send a car out ? Agent Scully is in Utah . She called me yesterday somewhere north of Sugarville . You got it . I 'll get someone right out there . Okay , thanks . I 'll be in touch . Danny , hi . This is John Doggett . I need you to trace a call for me . It came to this offiice yesterday about 1 : 30 in the afternoon . Am I doing this right ? Yeah , you can hold off now . Nothing 's happening . I 'm sorry , but , uh ... I 'm just winging it here . I mean , raising his blood sugar only helps if his condition is brought on by hypoglycemia . But this could be the result of any number of things . So what do we do ? Well , I 'm afraid that I have done all that I can do unless you know how to get ahold of diazepam or phenobarbital other than the nearest hospital which is where we should be , of course . Hey . Hey . Can you hear me ? How are you feeling ? Okay . Thank God . Thank God . We were all so scared . What can I do ? I think I just need rest . We should leave him alone . Can , uh , you stay ? I 'll go tell everybody . - Are you a doctor ? - Yes , I am . Thank you for , uh , helping me . Well , I 'm not sure if I 've actually done anything . In fact , I don 't even know , uh ... I don 't even know what 's going on with you right now . Do you know what your name is ? You don 't remember , do you ? How about how you got here ? What about these people who have taken you in ? Do you know anything about them ? Um ... They , uh ... take good care of me . Yeah , I 'd say they take very good care of you . The sun seems to rise and set on you as far as they 're concerned . In fact , they seem to have stranded me here in order to nurse you back to health . Why would they do that ? A murder took place about 20 miles from here . A man was stoned to death . His head was so badly crushed that they couldn 't identify him from his teeth . Now it looks like upwards of a dozen people may have participated due to the footprints at the crime scene but it 's a very tight-knit group of people who would murder together- - a cult , in a word- - and I 'd say that these people qualify . What are you ? A detective ? F.B.I. and I need to get you out of here but I don 't know how . Okay , do you think that you can walk ? I don 't know . Kind of weak . I understand . Hang , hang on a second . Let me just look at something , okay ? Hmm ? All right . [ Groans ] That 's starting to hurt . Maybe you shouldn 't do that . Hold on . [ Choking ] [ Phone Ringing ] - Doggett . - It 's Ciolino . We checked out the number you gave us . It 's a pay phone a half mile from the crime scene . Agent Scully must have just come from there when she called me . Looks like . I 'm sorry , still no sign of her . Are you canvassing ? Talking to neighbors ? We would , but there 's nobody to canvass . We 're looking at a pretty desolate area . There 's really nobody there . You got help coming from our Salt Lake City offiice . I 'm heading out there , too . - There 's a new angle to look at . - What 's that ? That pay phone . Before Scully 's call to me , the last call placed on it - was four days earlier , the night of the murder . - Yeah ? It was placed to a Juliette Gulatarski of Fort Collins , Colorado . She tells me it was her brother Hank . He was on his way for a visit . Said he was stuck in the desert , but would be there in two days . He never showed . Something 's happening . He 's coming to . Hey . Can you hear me ? How are you feeling ? I 'm alive . That 's a start . Oh , praise God . Praise Him . Praise Him . What 's wrong with me ? I just need some rest . She can take care of me . It 's lucky they 're still listening to you for the time being . This wound in your back ? It seems to be a point of entry for a parasitic organism that has taken up residence along your spine . Now , this is something that I am completely unfamiliar with . Oh , boy . I don 't know how far this extends or how to get it out of you without harming you . Does that mean I 'm dying ? You will die if we cannot treat you properly . Now , these people don 't seem to want to let you go . I think that they put this thing inside of you . Now , I have no idea what the motives of these people are- - whether it 's some bizarre religious activity- - but they killed the last person who was in your condition and I 'm afraid that they 're going to try and kill you , too . This is a lot to take in . No kidding . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to try and get us the hell out of here . These , uh , people tell me that they have no cars . I don 't believe them . They 've got to have transportation hidden around here somewhere . I 'm going to go take a look around , okay ? You 're not going to be gone long , right ? You know how to use a gun ? Pretty much . I 'll be back soon . The sooner the better . [ Knocking ] - Where did she go ? - She says I 'm dying . We need another swap . - Sheriff . Agent John Doggett . - You made good time . Agent Doggett , I 'm Brian Mayfiield , Salt Lake offiice . - We 're at your disposal . - Appreciate it . Sheriff , does this wound look familiar ? It 's the victim in our morgue . Where 'd you get it ? That 's not your murder victim . That 's a photo of a John Doe found off a West Texas highway in 1991 . Our guy has the same wound . Yeah , I thought you were going to say that . Arizona , ' 93 . New Mexico , ' 97 . Nevada , ' 99 . All four victims had their brains beaten out and were dumped in remote areas . - All four cases are unsolved . - How 'd you run these down ? Agent Scully had me track down this fiirst one . It noted glycoproteins at the crime scene which is what she found . This same wound kept showing up . These murders range throughout the southwest zigzagging all over the desert . The more remote the better . Hey . How 'd you ... ? You had me convinced . [ Grunts Angrily ] I 'm a federal agent ! At this moment , the F.B.I. is searching for me ! They won 't fiind you . Doctor . Your life ... is about to take a wonderful turn . You 're going to become a part of something much , much greater than you are . You 're going to be ... so loved . Amen.Amen. [ All ] Amen . Amen . No ! You son of a bitch ! Amen ! - Amen ! - You just murdered him ! - Amen ! - Amen ! - Amen ! - Amen ! Amen ! [ All ] Amen ! No . No ! I 'm pregnant ! No ! No , don 't do this ! I 'm going to have a baby ! No ! Don 't do this ! No ! I 'm going to have a baby ! No ! No ! No ! No ! [ Groaning In Pain ] [ Loud Gasp ] [ Loud Groaning ] What did you put in me ? ! I 'm going to get every last one of you bastards ! No . [ Groaning ] You 'll love us . You 'll protect us . You 'll teach us , make us better than we are . We 're taught not to envy , but I do envy you so . That you 'll soon be one with Him . Him ? ! That thing in my spine is a " " him " ? ! [ Yells In Pain ] Please . This is such a wonderful , wonderful thing ... for you ... and your unborn child . That last man just wasn 't a suitable tabernacle . The thing of it is there 's always the chance that your body won 't fail him ... that he 'll be in you forever . - [ Loud Groan ] - [ Car Approaching ] Help ! Help ! Help ! [ Muffled Shouting ] - Good evening . - Good evening . You lost ? Well , I may be . I 'm way the hell off the main road , that 's for sure . Can we help you ? Yeah , I hope so . I 'm , uh ... looking for this woman . Have you seen her ? - No . - No . Can 't say I have . Help ! Help ! She would have been driving a rental car like mine . You sure she hasn 't been through here ? - No . - We get so fewvisitors we remember each one pretty well . All right . Thanks for your time . Help ! Help ! [ Grunts ] Sheriff , this is Doggett . [ Sheriff ] I 'm reading you , Agent Doggett . Where are you ? 20 miles off the state road , just north of the crime scene . Some kind of outpost . It 's on your map . I 'm getting a defiinite vibe from it . Just talked to a guy who had a gun in his pocket and I don 't mean he was happy to see me . I 'll send everybody I 've got . Hurry . I can 't wait for you . [ Groaning ] [ Loud Groaning ] Hey . [ Grunting ] GodAlmighty.Agent Scully- - [ Groaning ] - Agent Scully . - [ Groans ] [ Muffled Gasping ] [ Gasping ] Get me the hell out of here . Can you walk ? I don 't know . How far is your car ? It 's about a half a mile up the road . I know something closer . [ Groaning ] - Can you hot-wire it ? - Can I hot-wire it ? Gone in 60 seconds , Jack . We 're going to strand these lunatics . - [ Loud Groan ] - Agent Scully ... - talk to me . - You got to cut it out . Cut it out . Oh ... oh ... Now it 's going to come to my brain . Cut it out of me now ! [ Yelling In Pain ] [ Gasping ] [ Yelling ] [ Loud Groaning ] Aah ! Just do it , Doggett ! [ Pounding And Banging Outside ] Why ? - Ready to go ? - Yeah , I 'm ready to go . Grand jury convenes today . All 47 cult members are sticking together . They 're not offering up much defense other than that they 're being persecuted for their religious beliefs . They believe they worshipped Christ . That that thing was the Second Coming . Look , I , uh , I wanted to apologize . I left you out of this case , and that was a mistake on my part . It was almost a fatal mistake . It was . You screwed up . And I won 't do it again . I appreciate it . [ Child ] I made this . [ Child ] I made this .

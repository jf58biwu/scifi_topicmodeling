 Previously on Farscape : No ! No ! I will not be a slave to your hormones . - Aeryn , no ! Aeryn , wait ! Two drops of this nectar and we can tell if our DNA 's compatible . Please ? Tyno : You kissed our Princess . What does that mean ? I want you to consider marrying her . ( both yelling rapturously ) You will rule not because you desire it , Clavor , but because I do . Jena : If you 're not going to be king , Clavor , I 'm not going to marry you . Zhaan : What is it , Pilot ? The Builders . Her creators . After we 're married , and I mean , right after we 're married , they turn us into statues . Oh , hello Crichton . My daughter or that abomination . Choose . There 's never been anything we couldn 't overcome together . Except each other . Here 's your wedding present from Prince Clavor . ( screaming ) Jenavian Chatto , Disruptor , Peacekeeper Special Directorate . So , what 's your assignment ? Stay close to Prince Clavor , my vapid little fiancee , and if he assumes the crown , kill him . I sense unhappiness , that your friend Crichton is marrying our Princess . Oh , yes ? And why would that make me unhappy ? Kahaynu : Moya can reproduce gunships . Moya must be decommissioned . She is killing herself because her deity commanded it . A little reunion is in order , don 't you think ? Crichton : I 've had three near death experiences in one day . You can 't just quit . I 'm not quitting . I just can 't go on . She is gone , and I am shortly to follow . This is what our child would look like ? One possibility . The choice is ours . I 'm exploring the Barren Lands . If you think you can keep up . ( chuckles ) Do you accept this burden in matrimony ? Without hesitation . It 's calibrated only for Sebaceans . Endure the pain and rule wisely . Woo ! ( screaming ) Chiana : Tonight on Farscape . D 'Argo : They look so ... Chiana : Stiff . Rygel : I think he should have taken his pose more seriously . Tyno : I believe he did the best he could . D 'Argo : So , what happens now ? For them , 80 cycles of government . Boring , but ultimately advantageous . And what do we do ? Scorpius has been asked to leave our system within the solar day . Once his Command Carrier vacates ... We hope that Moya returns and picks us up . Chiana : You really going to stay , Ryg ? Why not ? Crichton will need advising and ah , the food 's good . So he can hear us ? Every word . The acoustics of this chamber funnel all sounds to them . May we say goodbye ? I 'll wait outside . John . Hey , D 'Argo . You can hear us , but do you feel any pain ? No , but I 'd really love to pick my nose . He remains without a sense of humor . It 's good to hear your voice , John . Yours , too . Hey , can I say hi to Chiana ? Chiana . You look great in bronze . You look great in pink . Brings out your eyes . ( laughs ) Clavor : Frell ! Frell ! Frell ! I 'm gonna topple his statue ! I should be regent ! ( metallic clank ) ( gasps ) Cargn : While enormously symbolic , Your Highness , may I propose a more permanent tactic ? What ? ! ( growls ) ( gasps ) Cargn : Are you sure he 's still alive ? Clavor : Of course . Each cell is self-encapsulated . As long as the parts stay in their metallised state , he can be reconstituted . Cargn : Very impressive . My great grandfather was broken in half when the senate collapsed after a groundshaker . All he suffered was a severe limp . ( laughs ) Foundry acid should ensure this ruler fares worse . No , no , no , no , give it to me . Give it to me . I know you can hear me , Crichton , and I know you 're scared . Our laws state that a couple must rule together , hmm ? That 's why the crown must soon pass to me because you can 't rule with one little head . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Aeryn : I propose that we start here and traverse around . Excellent . You always this agreeable ? ( chuckles ) Am I being agreeable ? Well , everything I 've suggested , since the moment we met , you 've consented to . They 've all been good ideas . And your proficiency at this is ? I 've been rated expert . Really ? Mmm . That 's clearly a local custom . What 's this one called ? " Kiss your climbing partner " ? A different local custom . " Kiss woman you 're attracted to . " Right . You ready ? Novia : Whoever perpetrated this atrocity shall pay in kind . Beheaded ! D 'Argo : Surely you don 't think ... - Silence ! This planet is under stringent law until my daughter 's husband is made whole . No one is to leave or even contact their vessels , whether they purport to be a friend of the crown or not ! Mm ... mm ... Where is the one called Aeryn Sun ? The former Peacekeeper ? Rygel : We don 't know . She was upset that Crichton was to marry the Princess . I saw it with my own eyes . You cannot possibly think ... - l can 't possibly not ! Find her . Bring her to us for questioning . If you want someone with a motive for stealing Crichton 's head , try that vigilarScorpius . Everyone is suspect , especially off-worlders . If Prince Clavor assumes the throne , I cannot guarantee your safety . Find your friend 's head . Very fortunate I sampled your DNA when you were in the Aurora Chair . There would have been no other way to track you , Crichton . Though the crystalisation of your cells was designed to withstand 80 cycles of airborne corrosives , it seems three arns , well , a full-on acid attack is all it takes . You 're beginning to pit . And while I won 't be able to retrieve your body , I promise you , the wormhole calculations you have in your mind ... Who 's there ? Who 's there ? ( grunts ) ( DRD whirring ) You should use one of Moya 's Transport Pods instead of that little one . What do you care what I do ? All life is precious . Yours should continue . And Moya 's shouldn 't ? We have been through this . Moya can produce gunship offspring . We did not intend the universe to be subjected to that affliction . I 'm sorry . I must leave now . No ! Kahaynu ! If Moya 's life is to end capriciously , and Pilot 's also , you and I are going to remain with them . Doubtful . DRD , now ! In reverse ! Kahaynu : What ? Stop this ! Recommission Moya . I cannot. I will not . Turn the engine off ! I will spare you if you spare Moya . Stop ! I beg you ! How does it feel for your prayers to go unanswered , Kahaynu ? ( Kahaynu screams ) Dear goddess . In my rage , what have I done ? I cannot find Crichton 's head anywhere . I feel miserable . Hey ... Aren 't you tired ? Just responsible . I 'm the one that talked him into it . We had no other options . You said that yourself . We take what we get . ( loud screaming ) My body ! My body ! I 'm working on it . Working on it ? It 's impossible . Strangely not . If I do this right , your current state is not terminal . And if not done right ? Terminal . Get experts . We 're beyond that , don 't you think ? You 're way too vulnerable in this state . See exhibits " A " and " B. " Have you got a plan ? Revitalize you . Your speech abilities are so limited right now , you couldn 't convince the Empress you 're a headless statue . Whoa , nice dress . Save it . When the Empress sees you , my trillfiance and his Scarran will be in deep dren . Then you can be remade into a statue . That 's not much of a plan . As long as the parts are aligned right ... ( grunts in pain ) the machine should do the rest . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , hey , hey , hey , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Just a second ! Hey , come back ! ( electronic whirring ) ( groaning ) Can you turn your neck ? ( groaning ) Can you speak ? Thank you . Can you walk ? Uh ... uh ... ( groans ) ( frustrated sigh ) Cargn : I told you , it 's best we 're not seen together until after you 're married and assume the line of succession ! You mean , if I do . Crichton 's body is gone . Someone used the processor to revitalize him . Without his head , is that really a concern ? They 're still reconstructing the data but it seems , oh , great frell up , that his head was attached at the time ! Someone retrieved his head ? Do something , oh magnificent representative of a supposedly master race or you will surely die at my mother 's hand . And I , I will cheer her on . Aeryn : Dregon , what 's wrong ? Nothing . I 've secured it . You can come up now . Are your lines stuck ? I 'm coming down . - lt 's okay . Dregon ? - l 'm ... just ... Are you injured ? We 're too high . What ? Aeryn : You 've done this before , haven 't you ? Isn 't that right ? You were rated expert , correct ? At the training facility . This is your first wall ? Yeah . Outside . For the love of Cholak ! All right . Hang on . Right . Grab my hand . Dregon , just grab my hand . Good . Good . All right ... no .. . - Help me . Please . Don 't let me fall . I won 't. lt 's fine . All you have to do is hold on with that hand there . That left hand . Can you do that ? You got it ? Take a deep ... Take a deep breath ! Take a deep breath ... That 's it . All right , now , hold on . I 've got you . No , no , no , no , no , not my leg . The wall ! Hold on to the wall ! Aah ! Crichton : Where the hell are we ? Don 't worry about it . Somewhere no one will find you . That was not my question . ( Crichton grunts ) ( grunting ) : Ouch . is that your real name ? John Crichton ? - Yeah . And which Sebacean house is that from ? Hey now , if I tell you , I 'll have to kill you . Why is Scorpius here ? You don 't know ? He 's not part of my brief . However , he seems to be part of yours . Look , I appreciate that you have questions . I 'm sure you 'll appreciate that I 'm not going to answer them . ( grunts ) I heard some of what Scorpius said . He wasn 't protecting you as an ally . He was capturing you as prey . You wouldn 't like the truth . The data scan listed John Crichton as non-Sebacean . So , if you 're not Sebacean , you 're not Peacekeeper . If you 're not Peacekeeper , you 're not Special Directorate . If you 're not Special Directorate , you can 't be a Disruptor . And if you 're not a Disruptor , then you know too much about me . Oh . Well , there 's more , but that pretty much sums it up , yeah . That is either the most pathetic fabrication I 've ever heard , or the most pathetic life I could ever imagine . Either way ... - Oh , like they 're whacked out antecedents to a chick with a stiletto in her wrist ? Better . So did you kill Scorpy ? Leave bodies lying around , they look for a killer . It 's not like he 's going to report the assault . Then why choose me over him ? Because I couldn 't give a krag 's ass about anything but my job . Prevent the Scarrans from getting a claw on this empire . You 're my best chance of making that happen . Assuming I 'm willing to play garden gnome for the next 80 cycles . John , if I fail , so many innocent lives will be lost . Help me do my job and I 'll help you get what you want , whatever it is . You know , things never work out like you plan . That 's what makes it fun . Isn 't there any other way to contact help ? Not unless a ship passes and sees us . I told you before , these are the Devastator Reefs . Boats never come here . Well then , inland is our only hope , unless of course you want to stay . Please . Don 't leave me . Don 't tempt me . Zhaan : May the goddess recognize the gentleness of your spirit and guide you to your ancestors . ( sniffles ) Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan . You live . As does Moya . ( deep whirring ) ( gasps ) Zhaan : What kind of repellent game is this ? Upon my first exploration of Moya , I knew the circumstances that produced her gunship offspring , and I knew she was a worthy soul . Then why did you put her through this ? To see if you were worthy . These are gentle beasts who will ultimately follow the directions of those in control . Should you desire it , priestess , you could produce an army of killing machines . But Zhaan would never ... Of course she wouldn 't . We know that now . We are confident that you will protect Moya vigorously against those who seek to exploit her . You are worthy of that responsibility . If that is so , then I demand you leave this ship immediately . As you wish . But first ... Moya wishes to speak with you . Moya : Zhaan .. . ( laughs softly ) One request . Anything , Moya . Moya : Sing . ( laughing ) ( applause ) It 's good that you came . Do you know where Crichton is ? Honestly ? No . But I 'm as anxious to find him as you are . For his wormhole knowledge . Hmm . That 's secondary at this point . I 'm without accompaniment , totally unarmed . Should the Empress wish to execute us , I have no doubt she would succeed . So now we are allies ? Hmm . Effectively , yes . I assume you know Sastaretski Cargn , the Scarran Emissary ? And his alliance with Prince Clavor . Who 's next in line for the throne . So , they are our natural suspects . What do you want , Scorpius ? I will help you get Crichton off this planet alive , collect the information I need from his mind and release him to you , unharmed . You 're half Scarran , aren 't you ? By which measure I should not be judged . Cargn : Because it would find him lacking . Ka D 'Argo , is it ? Luxan ? A great race of warriors . I am honored . And to you , biological mistake , I commend your plan , having an agent marry the Princess . How did you defeat my DNA alterations of her ? Scorpius is not in league with Crichton . We despise him . Truly ? Have I misjudged the situation that badly ? Even if you establish diplomatic ties with this dynasty , that would mean that we , Peacekeepers , would have to respond , preventing it . And that could mean a total conflagration . But who would be seen as aggressor ? All but sealing their access to the Uncharted Territories ? ( growling ) Aah ! - Luxan brute , where is Crichton ? ! I don 't know . Has he been reconstituted into flesh and blood form ? Agh ! I ... I don 't know . is there anyone who does ? Chiana ... think she does ... but ... Enough ! I will offer you a deal . I would rather race you to the Nebari girl Chiana . The means to our different goals ... may be the same , Emissary . What about the coming conflagration between our species ? If you wish to provoke Peacekeeper might , well , we shall oblige , by defeating you . I would still rather race you to the girl . ( groans ) Please ! " Please ... " Stop dragging you ? No , but it ... I know , it hurts . You want it to not hurt ? Well next time ... hold on to the frelling wall ! Rygel ! Uh ? Have you seen Chiana ? No . Have you tried ... ( hiccups ) looking under your sheets ? I think Scorpius and the Scarran may have her . They think she knows were John and Aeryn are . We were looking together ... when she split off . Yeah ? - l 'm so nervous , I had to stop for a bite . Which I 'm too nervous to eat . Yeah , alright . What 's the matter ? I asked around . The last time the Empress threatened to execute off-worlders ... ( hiccups ) she did . Rygel ... I need your help . They 're going to torture her and she doesn 't know anything . I 'll float above the streets for a better view . Yes ! We 'll find her . What the frell is that ? She does not know Crichton 's whereabouts , as I suspected . So , get rid of her . I believe she may have another use . I don 't even want to know . Cargn , we 're through . Everything you said would pass has not . I 'm simply trying to ensure your ascension . If Crichton is not found by tomorrow , you 'll be crowned . Through no efforts of yours , sadly . Which means I no longer need your allegiance . The dissolution of our relationship is not yours to effect . Look , my mother knows about us . I can 't be married until I renounce you . I will not allow it . I 'm doing you a favor , a-hmm ? She 's going to start the ceremony by executing off-worlders . Get out of here . Hide . Run . There 's no way for me to escape and you know it . And I thought you were good . I am . I have one final question for you , duplicitous Prince Clavor . What ? Do you know that as promised , I am about to kill you ? No ... no ... No ! Yes . Just a little tingling in the hands and feet. I 'm good to go . Too late . Local animals are carnivorous after dark . Animals . Okay , fine . First light . I have people to protect . As I must mine . Can I trust you ? Oh yeah , I 'm a regular Boy Scout . I do what I have to do . And I assume you do it well . ( sniffing ) ( growling ) I , uh ... I have found Cargn . It will take both of us to kill him . Scarrans have exceptional strength . And why do you think I 'll help you ? He has Chiana . And you want her . And you don 't ? I want John Crichton . You 'll never get Crichton . He 'll die first . You underestimate the strength of a relationship even your friend does not yet understand . ( laughing ) I want you to have this . A little stuns and a lot kills . Tomorrow will be dangerous . Scorpius , Cargn , the Empress 's anger . Be careful . I might not be able to protect you . One step at a time , Jena . One step at a time . I 'm sorry I brought this on you . Do you always pursue women you don 't know ? If I 'm drawn to them . Would you be lying here helpless , giving up , if Crichton were back there waiting for you ? You wouldn 't understand . Does your leg hurt ? It 's broken . I 'm trained to deal with that . That 's the answer . You 're not trained to deal with emotions . So you 're afraid of them . Emotional pain ... you wear like a badge . It means you 've been there . And it can 't get calloused because each fresh hurt stings like the first . Why would you want that ? Because of all the days before it hurts . The good days , when you 're in love . It 's too bad you can 't get back to at least tell Crichton how you feel . What difference would it make ? He 's a frelling statue . But he can hear . He can see . He 'll know , Aeryn . At least he 'll know . Crichton : You 're late . I 'm moving a little slow . Are you ready to do this ? I 've grieved with the best of them . All right , showtime . I hope it all works out . One way or the other . We 're not compatible . ( glass breaking ) You always know just what to say . Not always . But sometimes I know who to say it to . Give me some time before you enter . ( grunting and panting ) Aeryn . What ? Look . Man : Hello . Hello , do you need help ? Stay there. I 'll come and get you . Yes . Dregon : Aeryn ? Listen . I know this didn 't turn out like we wanted . I know I was a hindrance . But I was hoping ... we could go out again ? No ! No ! This can 't be ! I 'm sorry , Jenavian . There was nothing we could do . Surely the Empress knows that this is the Scarran 's work . How could she not ? Of course she knows ! And he will be the first one put to death . Why the rest of us ? Because , fool that he was , no offense , Prince Clavor was her son . You will all be arrested and executed . Crichton : I feel compelled to disagree with the Empress on that decision . Crichton ... Crichton ! Hey , Sparky . Oh , thank the spirits . Jena . Sorry about your Prince , but I hear he deserved it . ( sobbing ) Your Excellency , who defiled your position ? Who rescued you ? Later . Rygel , what about the others ? Nothing on Aeryn. I 'm sorry . D 'Argo 's with Scorpius . They think the Scarran has Chiana So they 're gonna to kill him . Crichton , wait ! Where are you going ? I don 't know. I 'll let you know when I get there . I 'm assuming my execution is off . Chiana ! ( whimpering ) Stay back ! He cannot damage your brain from this distance , but any closer ... There are two of us and only one of him . How badly do you want him dead ? ( Chiana whimpering ) No closer or the girl dies . That will not help Prince Clavor become king . Agreed . This is about killing you . The girl . Has she told you where Crichton is ? Of course not . She doesn 't know . But she did say you aren 't allies , and that in all probability , you did not come here to impede my plan . It must be painful to realize that you are defeated , yes , defeated , by nothing more than your own suspicions . Too hot in here , Scorpius ? What 's the matter ? When he becomes incapacitated , I shall turn full attention to you ! Nothing. lt 's nothing . Don 't listen to him . Because if you do , you 'll know this mutant 's weakness . That his Scarran half loves the heat , thrives in heat , craves heat . But his Peacekeeper half is destroyed by that same warmth . is this true ? Thermal regulator suit , cooling rods inserted directly into his brain . Tell me the rumors are true . Please tell me your search for thermic constancy is tormentful . ( yelling ) ( screaming ) Luxan coward . Now you will die ! Hey ! Crichton ! ( screaming ) You haven 't defeated me ! Obviously not . But you dumped me in the acid , so let 's see how you like it ! ( screaming ) ( screaming ) Chiana ! No ! You 're the best . - How Batman was that ? ! You guys okay ? We 're fine , John . It 's good to see you . You , too . What about Scorpy ? is he dead ? If he isn 't , he should be by the time you come out . ( screaming ) I 'm not your enemy . I 'm not your friend . You leave me the hell alone . Or the next time we part , one of us will be dead . I am sorry if it upsets your line of succession , but I am not going to be a statue again . I understand your concerns , as I 'm sure you must understand ours . However , if you 're the kind of man that would walk away from his own child , we would not want you to rule . Child ? What the hell are you talking about ? My daughter is pregnant with your seed . How ? Whoa ! How ? No , no . We never ... Samples from the DNA comparison . Did you really think a system this stable would leave so important a detail to chance ? Make me a statue . You change your mind so quickly . A child deserves two parents . My child deserves a father . Make me a statue . Counselor Tyno , arrange for this honorable man to reundergo the transmutation process . I 'm afraid that 's impossible , Empress . Recall that Crichton is not Sebacean . Based on our findings , human physiology would not tolerate the process a second time . What the hell are you talking about ? If you stood beneath that machine again , you would die . She won 't be defrosted for another 80 cycles . I 'm not going to live that long . I won 't be there for them ! I know ! I 'm sorry . You take my place . I can 't . Nobody knows me , right ? The public , they don 't know who I am . Your unveiling was to be your introduction . Right . Counselor Tyno can be your new king . Their chromosomes are not compatible ! It doesn 't matter . She 's already pregnant . And it satisfies everything that you need . And it gives my child a good father . And they love each other . ( headset beeps ) What do you say ? Does this work for you ? Yes . Thank you . I 'm sorry that I won 't be around . I 'll never forget . It 's your call . As long as the secrets we forge in this room do not escape , it can be done . Well , there you go . Good guys win for once . And I have a child that I 'll never know . Princess Katralla wants to know if you 'd like to see your offspring . Yes . Hi , there . Hi . Are you my Dad ? Yeah , that 's right . I love you , Daddy . You take care of my little girl . So how come Crichton didn 't kill Scorpius ? D 'Argo : It was a mistake . One that I fear will come back to haunt us . Yeah , but he can 't follow us , right ? Well Pilot says that we 're safer now . Did he tell you what happened to Moya ? Zhaan , either . Rygel thinks they were scared I just think they were lost . Either way , they 're keeping it to themselves . Hey . I 'm very proud of you . I 'm proud of you . You handled yourself well . Well , you handled meself well , too . What 's the matter ? Aw , I just can 't stop thinking about Crichton will never see his daughter again . Hits pretty close to home , huh ? The fact that I may never see my son again is a grief I would wish upon no one . It pains me to think of what he 's going through right now . It pains me , too . And you thought we weren 't compatible . Zhaan said the surgical reconstructors did an excellent job on your leg . There 's no sign that it was ever broken . Yeah , I was , uh ... worried about you when you didn 't show up for the wedding . Anyway , I 'm ... I 'm just glad you 're okay . And I have noticed that you 're not talking to me .

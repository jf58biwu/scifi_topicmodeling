 Because this turn of events was made possible by various factors , including governments of various countries and the United Nations working in cooperation , I cannot and will not make any further comment . Now , we need to get on the same footing as the people of space . With that , I 'd like to end today 's interview . In Cabinet Secretary lto 's words , " Sorry we kept a lot of things secret . " That 's probably what he 'd say . Good job . Good job . Evening News Evening News In the past , it 's been rare to see a civilian ... Evening News ... conduct an interview on behalf of the government . Evening News Evening News It 's apparent that , surprisingly , Mr. Murata is the person at the heart of this project ... Hey ! What was that for ? What was that for ? Thanks for dragging me out into the public eye ! It means that the time to do everything in secrecy is over . Sooner or later the Federation 's enemies will be focusing on you . Really ? Yup . We will be assigning you a bodyguard from now on . Fine , fine . And we will be increasing security at the development center . The Galactic Federation will also be sending additional help . Additional help ? So that 's the story . Kazuo ! Yoo-hoo ! Hey ! Are you guys the additional help ? All right , now 's our chance ! Futaba , it 's all right . There 's nothing to worry about . Look at you . Just hurry up and get going . Mom , you 're being naive ! It 's times like this when the press comes after the family ruthlessly and bombards them with flashes ! Like , click , click , click , click ! In what day and age was the press like that ? He 's right . This isn 't some sort of movie from the olden-days . Now ! We have to jump out when they 're least expecting it ! We 're not taking any interviews ! Huh ? Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Record of the School Wars : MURYOU I looked up at the sky ...

" Who knew Murata 's father was someone so distinguished ! Pepper tree ? What are you saying ? His father ! Murata 's ! Oh , that . You 're so apathetic . The Tenmo people 's existence is in jeopardy . Murata is Murata . His father is his father . It 's none of our business . You 're right . It 's none of our business . Fine , fine ! I understand . I 'll shut up . 2nd Year Homeroom C Well it 's that ... It 's um ... You know ... What are you talking about ? Everyone wants to ask you ... about your father . You idiot ! Toshio ! Don 't call me an idiot . You guys are acting strange by being overly sensitive . Well the thing is , I never really had any interest in my dad 's work , so ... I also want to know what 's going on . Then why don 't you ask him ? If you want to know , you should ask your father . Ask him ? Yup . I think he 'd tell you . I 'm sure of it . Hajime ! Yeah ? Come here . Come here . Come here ? Yes , come here . So , what is it ? Can you come to the PA room during lunch break ? I want to interview you . Hikaru , you can 't do an interview about that ! No , no ! Of course I wouldn 't do an interview about that ! I want to do an interview about the Festival Club . About the club ? Yup ! About your enthusiasm towards the Cultural Festival , and your ambitions . Ambitions ? Yes , ambitions ! Coming ! Okay . Okay . Hello , you 've reached the Murata family . I 'm a Murata too . Oh , Kazuo ? By the way , did you see it ? On TV ? We saw it . You were acting like such a big shot . Come on , be a little surprised ! What ? Are you working there just to find ways to surprise me ? No , that 's not it . Yes , yes . I was surprised ... very , actually . It looks like the almighty Cabinet Secretary is taking care of the media . But how are the neighbors reacting ? I don 't know . It 's too soon to tell . If worse comes to worst , you 'd better take responsibility . Hey , hey ! Calibrating PA equipment , Do Not Enter ! Hikaru Loosen up . It may be an interview , but it 's not that big of a deal . Oh ... Don 't worry about it this time ! It 's really good . It 's the Hikaru special blend , version number ... Umm ... Well anyway , after numerous revisions , I 've perfected it . The flavor is legendary ! You just perfected it and it 's legendary already ? I didn 't expect you to be so harsh ! It 's nasty . It 's nasty . So , what 's the interview about ? Ahem ! We , the media committee , are thinking about working extra hard to liven up the Cultural Festival in the fall , you see ! Yes , yes . One " yes " will do ! S ... Sorry . As one of the main features , we would like to fully endorse your club 's activities . Thank you very much . So , we 'd like to write a big article about the club 's plans and enthusiasm and what not in our upcoming paper and in the online school newspaper . What do you think ? That 's great for us ... But wait . Is this the student body president 's ... Tsumori 's idea ? No , that 's not why . I 'm not the type of person who mixes personal matters with work . This time around , what I 'm interested in is you ! Huh ? Why is that ? Because you 're interesting . Un , deux , trois ... Un , deux , trois ... Un , deux , trois ... See ? Lots of interesting things are happening at school . All centered around you . Fine then , come in . You 're going to attract more attention by snooping around . I 'm coming in ! Well ... I ... was informed that Murata went into the PA room , so ... I thought everyone was up to no good again . Up to no good ! That 's great ! We were up to no good ! I was getting interviewed for the Cultural Festival . The Cultural Festival ? Oh that 's right ! I approved your application for participation , but do you guys know what you 'll be doing ? I need to know soon , or it 's going to be a problem . Oh , you 're right . This is perfect ! Why don 't you announce what the Festival Club 's plans are , right now ? Well that 's ... What ? You can 't talk about it if I 'm here ? No , that 's not why . It 's because we 're still collecting information . It 's not easy , because Tenmo has a lot of different festivals and specific procedures associated with it . You guys aren 't doing it on the Shrine Descension ? Huh ? What 's that ? But Hachiyou 's the one who asked you to start the club , right ? I thought if Hachiyou was the mastermind you guys were going to do the Shrine Descension . Shrine Descension ? I think I 've heard of it , but all we were asked was if we wanted to put on a festival . What ? Nowadays , the people who moved here from somewhere else outnumber the natives . The population has grown , but there aren 't enough people involved . So I have an idea ! Is the idea to get people involved , starting with the students ? Exactly ! Festivals are great ! I get it ! The reason you were always picking a fight with us was because you thought we were following Hachiyou 's orders ! That 's awful . Oh my , Vice President . Did you totally get the wrong idea and take it out on the wrong person ? W ... What ? Fine ! Fine already ! Then we 'll forget all the misunderstandings we 've had up until now . We 're even ! So , as the daughter of the shrine priest and as the successor of the Child Dance I will check the information you 've collected so far to see how accurate it is ! Huh ? Really ? Lucky us ! We 'll meet at my house this afternoon . Your house ? At the Tenmo Shrine ? You better not run away ! What was that about ? It 's so like Nayuta to slip an apology in , in the midst of the confusion . Apology ? For what ? Remember how Nayuta kept picking fights with you when you submitted your Festival Club application for participation ? I think it 's her way of saying sorry . She 's sorry ? You think so ? What 's up with Nayuta ? She looked really happy . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU All right ! This way ! Here I come ! All right ! This way ! Here I come ! It 's Isozaki . It 's open ! Welcome ! Welcome ! Well , what is it you wanted to show me ? This . Is that ... ? Yup . This is what I wanted to show you . It 's a liquid metal robot from Planet Decoya . Planet Decoya ? It 's a world that 's affiliated with the Cosmos Alliance , which is an organization separate from the Galactic Federation . It 's a group you guys consider hostile to the Federation . Jiltosh ! That 's right . The junk Setsuna brought yesterday was from a robot made on Planet Decoya . So you did know ! Yeah , I knew ... But don 't you want to listen to what Mr. So has to say ? So you were the one involved with Earth 's space diplomacy ruckus . Yes , it was me . What is the meaning of this ? A mere planetary diplomat does not have this kind of authority ! Of course not . This was a task given to me from above . Above ? Yes , a higher council that overrides the Security Council you belong to . If you don 't believe me , you can call and ask them . Are we ... letting Earth join the Federation ? For now , we have to cooperate with Earth to protect the power of Shingu from the anti-Federation forces . But we 're already cooperating with them ! Mr. Yamamoto and the people of the Sanemori clan ... They 're exceptions . Frankly , leaving this to the people of Earth is ... This has become too much to be handled exclusively by the people of the Sanemori Clan . This robot proves my point . Other forces besides the Galactic Federation are starting to come here now . Okay , guys . This house is the jolly Seagull House ! The time for depressing talk is over ! On Earth , they do something fun to lighten up the mood at times this like . Woo-hoo ! I 've been waitin ' for this ! You thought you could fool me ? You guys are fools after all ! Who am I ? I am Hayabusa ! Haya busa ... Hayabusa ! Haya busa Haya busa I wasn 't really expecting that one ... Haya busa Coming ! Hello , you 've reached the Murata residence . I 'm a Murata too . What 's wrong ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Your father called earlier , so ... Dad ? He was asking , " Is Hajime using my cell phone ? " I just got it yesterday ! Well , yeah I 'm using it . Well , how is it ? How is it ? It 's just an ordinary phone . Anyway , I 'm going over to Moriyama 's house before I come home . Moriyama ? Oh , Nayuta ! You 're pretty slick ! Bye . Last Call , 1 minute 35 seconds I 'm ready ! All right ! Let 's go ! M orly ama M orly ama Hello ? M orly ama Nayuta hasn 't come home yet . She told us to come here ... You 're Murata , aren 't you ? I heard you established a Festival Club . Yes , and she said she was going to check what our club has done so far ... Sorry ! Nayuta ! I 'm home . I was getting some stuff and it took longer than I expected . Here . What 's this ? Isn 't it obvious ? They 're snacks . I 'll meet you in the shrine office , so get them ready ! Excuse me . Excuse me . Sorry ! Sorry ! Father , will you please show them the way ? I 'm going to go to the kitchen . S ... Sure . She 's full of energy ... Nayuta is giving Murata a festival lecture ? That 's right ! She said she was going to check what the Festival Club has done so far . Where ? At the shrine , but I think it 's more or less at her house . Really ... I wonder what 's gotten into her ? But , I 'm kind of upset that they didn 't invite me . I feel left out . You have student government work to do . So does Nayuta ! Huh ? I 'm surprised you 're not getting angry today . Why ? Why should I get angry over a festival lecture ? Shun , are you disappointed ? What 's wrong ? I can 't hear it . The voice of Sanemori ... Nayuta ! Will you take this please ? Huh ? Wasn 't that Moriyama ? Sorry to keep you waiting ! Sir , where did she just go ? Sir , where did she just go ? Okay , okay , okay . Sir , where did she just go ? She had to ... Huh ? She had to ... What the ... ? Murata , tea is ... ALERT ALERT Approximate transport destination of the giant mobile weapon : Approximate transport destination of the giant mobile weapon : Above the waters near Tanegashima . Tanegashima ? Hey , Hajime ! Murata , the bathroom 's at the end of the hallway on the right ! Right ! Bathroom , bathroom ! It 's been a while since they had to launch a defensive . We have to hurry ! Okay ! Hurry ! Okay ! Hurry ! By the way , why do the aliens always attack with only one fleet ? Because it 's an " investigation , " not an " invasion " . That 's going to be their defense strategy if it comes up in an argument . I see . The other reason , is that they think that 's all they 'll need to take over this planet . Confident , aren 't they ? Then , that means we need to settle this while they 're still feeling confident or it 's going to be bad . Exactly . A planet like this could get blown to smithereens . Perfect timing . Both parties have just arrived ! Both parties ? Turn around . Nayuta , I 'm sending you our power ! First attack takes the victory . Destroy it with your first attack ! Festival lecture . Festival lecture . Energy Level Rising Is this supposed to be live coverage ? Nayuta ! Nayuta ! Nayuta ! You can do it , guys . All right ! All right ! That 's the Shingu ? Yup . Hi everyone ! Hiya ! Are they also from the Galactic Federation ? Yes . This is ... I 'm Isozaki . I 'm Jiltosh ! I am Weinul . I 'm Kazuo Murata . You got something really nice . Oh , Muryou . That 's a Galactic Federation communications device . Your dad 's really generous to give that to you . Hey , Hajime ! Yeah ! All right ! Let 's do it ! You 're wrong ! There are steps to putting on a festival , and each step has a meaning ! You can 't be all sloppy about it ! Do you understand ? Let 's start a week before the festival . Preparation is also part of the festival ! Thus , we continued to listen to Moriyama 's oddly heated lecture for about three full hours . This was her way of expressing sincerity , but it was quite a painful ordeal for us . To be continued in the next episode . To be continued Next Episode I 'm Shun ! I 'm Nayuta . By the way , Kyoichi and Harumi 's relationship is going at such a slow pace ... It makes people want to help them along . Itjust means that they 're serious . They 're not like you , you know ! But it looks like Harumi has finally made up her mind ! What ? Marriage ? ! Wow , you 're thinking really far ahead . Next episode of Record of the School Wars : Muryou ! Inherited Sorrows ! Inherited Sorrows Hey ! What did she make her mind up about ? Look forward to it ! Hey , tell me ! Inherited Sorrows

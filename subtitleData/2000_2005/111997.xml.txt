 Dr. Cameron . All units ready . [ Electronic Beeping ] - Activate energy mode , level one . - Yes , sir . Proceed to test one . [ Hissing ] [ Whirring ] Now we 'll demonstrate RS1 ' s basic weapon system . Show time . [ Screaming ] No need for alarm . The temperature threshold of this glass is 3,000 degrees . Proceed to test two . Yes , sir . [ Man ] Hey , Dr. Cameron . What is this ? These tube balls are filled with a highly volatile explosive . RS1 has figured out that if he hits them , he will be destroyed . RS1 has dexterity as well as power . [ Laughing ] Congratulations ! What else do you expect ? Congratulations ! Thank you . [ Man ] Dr. Cameron , that was just amazing ! Now I know where all my money went . Well , if you hadn 't paid for us to try , we wouldn 't have had the chance to succeed . Say , where 's that , uh , bright young Chinese fellow ? That computer whiz ? What was his name ? It doesn 't matter now . He 's bright enough ... - but he lacked discipline . - Oh , too bad . Anyway , here 's to RS1 . Cheers . [ Chattering ] Good work , crew . Get down ! [ Beeping ] [ Screaming ] Steve ! Abort the program ! [ Yelling , Indistinct ] [ Woman Screaming Hysterically ] [ Grunting ] [ Screaming Continues ] Someone 's hacked into the mainframe . Cut the power ! Yes , sir ! [ Muted Screaming , Indistinct ] [ Shouting , Screaming ] [ Chuckling ] [ Woman ] Help me ! Help me ! - [ Woman , Sobbing ] Oh , God ! - [ Whirring Stops ] Ooh ! Yes ! Can you tell me just what happened here ? How are we meant to take that thing to Hong Kong ? The weapon exhibition is just one week away ! There 's nothing wrong with RS 1 itself . Someone hacked into the system . We can seal the breach ... but I think we better not go to Hong Kong . And risk our government funding ? I 've invested millions in this project ! You just make sure that RS 1 is hacker-proof ! We 'll let the F.B.I. Take care of the physical security . - No problem here . - Whoever did this knows way too much . Whatever happens , we 'll handle it . Mission accomplished . We 've helped you find your baby . Now you help us find a fortune . Right . Next stop ... Hong Kong ! [ Man ] Yeah ? It 's a deal ? Okay . Bye . Do you remember I told you I invested in that dot-com thing ? - Well , we just got bought up by Microhard . - So what ? Who cares about your dot-com , huh ? It 's all a load of crap . Yeah , but who 's got the Ferrari ? Call it what you like . It makes money . So what ? It 's not real , it 's virtual . Yeah , you 're just saying that 'cause you 're jealous . You really wish you were sitting behind this wheel , right ? But did Robin drive the Batmobile ? Did he ? Huh ? - Look , I don 't give a shit . All right ? - Let 's face it , Alien . - You 're just not cut out to be a businessman . - Oh , is that right ? Shit , what do I care ? I 'm rich enough . Okay ? Hey , where 's the photo ? You got it ? Which one ? The one of the guy we 're looking for , you idiot ! Here . Great , dick-brain ! Now what do we do ? Sorry , man ! Don 't worry , I 'll remember his face . They lost contact with the undercover cop for three weeks . I guess his cover must have been blown . What an amateur ! [ Laughing ] [ Man ] Who is it ? Fidel Castro . Who else ? Dr. Ruth . Got money ? Yeah . But it 's not for you . [ Chuckling ] Come on in . * [ Rock ] [ Yelling , Cheering ] Come on , kill him ! [ Man With Jamaican Accent ] Come on , what you doin 'here ? Hey , uh , man . How 's it hangin ' ? Hey , man ! I haven 't seen you guys for a while . You gonna come stock up on Jamaica 's finest ? You read my mind , as usual . You got any here ? Enjoy , man ! Yeah , man . Good stuff ! I 'll blow your mind . Have you got any hash ? No , but you want to see what I got , you come around to my place . I want a discount , man . Gonna blow your mind . It 's good stuff , man . This is the best of the best , man . Really ? Yeah . [ Grunting ] Hey , what 'd he do , man ? - They 're really kicking his ass . - You know Judas ? This is him . We 're going to bust him up big time . Hey , man . You gotta look at this . The best equipment you can ever get , I tell you . You just dial " 9-9-9 " then , boom ! This little baby 's made in England : Ml6 . Thirty grand and it 's yours . A phone-controlled bomb ? It goes off when you dial emergency ? I don 't believe it . It 's the latest gizmo to hit the streets , guys . High-tech equipment . F.B.I. , C.I.A. , K.G.B. You name it . Card or cash ? Cash ! Cash ! [ Screams ] Yo ! Shut up ! [ Clattering ] [ Jamaican Groans , Sighs ] I remember ! Edison . Edison ! [ Groaning ] Hey ! What 's your name ? Eddie ... " Ed-die " what ? Ed-die . Hey ! I think I found him ! [ Grunting ] Let 's go . Well , up here is 22nd-century technology . - [ Man ] It better be . - Have I ever lied to you ? - [ Man ] Yeah . - [ Chuckling ] Are those two faggots with you ? Check them out . No . Let me take care of it . All right ? Okay . - What was your name again ? - Ed-die . " Eddie-son " ? Not " Son " ? Eddy Wong ! [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] Edison ? Hey , it 's cool . We 're here to help you . [ Both Groaning ] Just a couple of bitches , boys . Come on . Let 's go . Okay . Back to business . [ Gasping , Groaning ] Aah ! [ Whimpering ] [ Wincing In Pain ] I gotta get this thing wrapped up tonight , you understand ? I 'm gonna need some backup . Backup my ass . Now , look . This is the D 1 01 0 . The ultimate cash machine . It can break any bank , bust any safe , crack any code ... and , it installs free cable . Sounds good . Where 'd you get it ? The Hong Kong police ! [ All Laughing ] Something 's going down , all right . [ Beeping ] Whose phone is that ? It 's yours , of course . That 's not my phone . Not ... yours ? [ Controlled Whimpering ] [ Female Operator ] Emergency Services ? Hello ? Hello ? Who do you want ? [ Groans ] My Ferrari ! Who the hell are they ? - You ! Go get them ! - [ Shrieking ] [ Computer Voice ] Emergency Services , dial 9-9-9 . [ Girls Shrieking ] [ Grunting ] [ Slamming On Door ] You can 't do that on my turf ! Get in there , boys ! Barbecue them ! Yeah ! Take that , asshole . Have a nice trip . Okay , guys . Ready with the shades ? Cool ! [ Laughing ] Okay . Sir ! Right . Give me ... Yes , the car keys . I know . [ Cops ] Come on , spread ' em . You ! Don 't move . Hey . The name 's Edison . Edi-son of a bitch . [ Chattering Continues ] [ Computer Voice ] Emergency services , dial 9-9-9 . Emergency service ... Hurry up ! Stop pushing , okay ? Get a move on , will ya ? Go on ! We 're gonna be too late ! Shut up ! It 's your fault . Hold that elevator ! Hey , hey ! Wait , wai-wai-wait ! [ Groans ] [ Groans , Laughs ] Sorry , man . [ Sighs ] [ Man ] As you know , the International Military Technology Exhibition ... is to be held in Hong Kong . It will feature the latest in state-of-the-art weaponry ... including the new American attack robot , RS1 . The exhibits will be escorted from their countries of origin ... by specially-trained security teams . The RS 1 will be accompanied by a team from the F.B.I. Of course , responsibility ... Do you know her ? for coordinating security will rest on the Hong Kong Police . Intimately . Really ? That 's you . Your individual duties are listed on the notice board outside . They should be noted down and then memorized . Is that clear ? [ All ] Yes , sir ! Thank you , sir . Well ? I 'd say she 's been undercover at the Playboy Club for too long . You really think so ? In my opinion ... - She wouldn 't even know which end to stick her tail . - Oh , wow . Like I 'm so excited to be here with you . And , it 's my pleasure to introduce a guy you all know . Chief Inspector Wah ! Yeah ! Go , sir ! - [ Chuckles Uncomfortably ] - [ Scattered Applauding ] Hey , sir . Show time ! Huh ? Oh , sorry . [ Sniffs ] [ Applause Pattering ] I 'd like to introduce you to a robot I designed some time ago : D 1 01 0 . Hello . My name is D 1 0 1 0 . Hello . My name is D 1 01 0 . [ Pulls Switch ] Don 't be fooled . It 's not a vacuum cleaner . This is D 1 01 0 ... a sophisticated computer using crisis management . Whatever the emergency situation , this machine can handle ... - Stupid rubbish bin . - It could be a major fire , or flood or nuclear explosion . This machine handles them all , and will even pick your winning lottery numbers . Maybe I could start by giving a demonstration . The box , please . Thank you . Bomb disposal . [ Beeping ] - Thank you . - You are welcome . [ Beeping Continues ] [ Electronic Warbling ] [ Computer Voice ] Green wire ... Hmm . [ Warbling Stops ] [ Rapid Beeping ] [ Computer Voice ] ... should not be cut . - [ Explosion ] - [ Screaming ] [ Relieved Laughing ] The fault in this case goes down to me . I failed to wait for the entire answer before I acted . It proves that D 1 01 0 is totally infallible , though a little slow . It also proves ... [ Smaller Explosion ] [ Nervous Laughing ] Oli . Match ! I thought you might have forgotten me . How could I forget you ... after such a wonderful night ? Especially after I took you home , right ? You 're so skillful . Better than the others . Is that right ? I know it 's cool nowadays to talk about sex openly . But you should think about others , and try to respect their feelings . I haven 't had it for ages ! Dirty old man ! You started it ! No way . I meant video games , right ? Oh , this is my partner . Alien ? You heard of me ? Sure , one of my friends has a huge crush on you . You 're a popular guy . Really ? What ? Is she weird or something ? No , it 's Peggy . Hey , look . Here she comes now . Nice to meet ya ! Ah ! Ah-ha ! - [ Both Screaming ] - Well , then , now you 've met your dream partner . I bet you can 't wait . Yeah , isn 't he gorgeous ? I just knew you two would hit it off right away . Hey , I tell you what . Next Saturday , let 's all go out together . Good idea ! I can 't . I 've just been assigned a new case . I 'm on surveillance . [ Laughing ] Sorry . Gotta go . But , Alien ... [ Whimpering ] [ Cheerful Woman ] All right ! Get waving , people ! I wanna see some energy ! Come on , now . Lemme see those flags . Right . Higher ! More energy ! Who are we ? We 're the Hong Kong Police . Come on ! I wanna see you all smile , okay ? She 's sick . Nobody normal acts that way . Come on , guys ! Hey , man ! You get out of this job what you put into it . [ Woman ] Let 's say welcome to our friends at the F.B.I. ! Don 't stop , come on , guys . Keep it up ! We want to hear it ! Here we go ! Yeah , let 's hear it ! Give me an " F. " Give me a " B. " Give me an " I. " F - B-I ! Yeah ! - Oh ! Sorry . - [ Raucous Laughing ] Chief Tucker ? Welcome to Hong Kong . [ Jibes Continue ] What 's going on ? l-I 'm so sorry . It 's been a long day , and they 've all been waiting ... It 's okay , guys . Nice shot . [ Woman Chuckles ] Thank you . Good shot , man . Hey , that was great ! Madam , we 're experienced police officers . We 're trained to handle big cases . Sure , I know that . And your experience will be put to good use . - Look . You see ? - Bellboy ? The International Military Technology Exhibition features the latest weaponry ... available on the market today . This special preview 's been arranged just for you senior offices . Now , here we have a new generation of " smart rifle " for urban combat . Made in Germany ... Yeah , it 's really amazing ! The best thing about it is the new turbo headset with the fuzzy logic aiming display ... coupled with the low-intensity argon laser ... which , at 1 50 yards , can shoot the wedding tackle off a hummingbird . [ Laughing ] Let 's go to the next exhibit . This way . Right . This is the new French robot , Merde . It features the latest stealth technology from Britain ... and software developed in Russia . The problem was , the code was written by a French Canadian . But never mind , the next thing I want to show you has to be ... the most intelligent machine ever devised by man . I know when most people think of high-tech weapons , Hong Kong doesn 't spring to mind . But what we have here is an amazing machine that 's made in Hong Kong . The D 1 01 0 . You probably think that this machine looks like me . But that 's quite normal . I designed it . It 's been designed to operate in situations where rapid crisis ... [ Laughing ] Sorry , lady . This isn 't a trash can . [ Thumping Sound ] Huh ? [ Whirring ] [ Whirring ] Don 't worry , ladies and gentlemen , these are not robots ... but our engineers Dr. Tang and Dr. Lai from the Chinese Research Institute . Excuse me , doctor , but what 's the purpose of the machine you 're working on ? [ Muttering ] Yeah , right . Okay . Well , I 'm glad you asked . Its principal purpose ... is to precisely replicate the movements of the human body . [ Guffawing ] [ Man ] A one-armed bandit from China ! All right , listen up everybody . These are D.N.A. I.D. Passes . I 've stored all the D.N.A. information of all security personnel on these cards . To enter , swipe . If the machine recognizes your D.N.A. , you 'll be let in . If not , the alarm will sound ... like this . [ No Alarm Sounds ] [ Giggling ] Like this ? Surprise , surprise . It doesn 't work . You know ? All right . My first guess ... is that they put this job up for grabs and offered a cut-rate deal to the lowest bidder . You think ? Did you see that bulletproof glass out there ? One sneeze from a fat guy and it shattered . This lab is built according to the blueprint that your agency sent us . So , what is the problem ? I guess the " problem " is that we didn 't have it translated . No , you don 't understand . I assure you , this place is the state of the art . [ Sneers ] For Hong Kong , maybe . I mean , what else is wrong , huh ? The walls aren 't thick enough , the lighting isn 't bright enough ... there isn 't enough power ... This is not a Teletubby we 're keeping in here . I thought you American " experts " are controlling the robot . What 's there to worry about ? Did anyone ask for your input ? All right , everyone just stay calm . Let 's focus on the job at hand . I 'll have a crew fix the lighting and power problems . Jane , get some of the tech boys on that D.N.A. Machine . Quincy , see what you can do about getting that glass replaced . Agent Tucker ! [ Laughing ] I really hoped we could cooperate on this ... because the U.S. Zone is our responsibility ... Of course . We appreciate the effort . I 'm sure there 's something you can do for us . Of course ! Isn 't that right , Agent Curtis ? Yeah , definitely . Get me some coffee . Black . How about you guys ? Mocha , please . Yeah , an Irish Coffee . Latte . - Irish Coffee ? - Give me black , with a glazed donut . Latte , donut ... Egg tart will do ? Okay , guys . I need you to do something for me . Could you get me a cappuccino , and three Irish Coffees ? Also four cafe lattes , one donut and , uh ... Oh , one lemon tea . [ Scoffs ] I 'm a police officer ... not a frickin delivery boy . [ Sighs ] Come on , Match . Madam , before I joined up , I delivered pizzas . [ Chuckles ] Thank you very much . That 's my boy ! Don 't be long ! [ Chuckles ] [ Cell Phone Playing Tune ] Hello ? My God , man , where have you been ? All right , all right . I got a couple things to handle . Uh ... pick a spot and call me back in ten , okay ? All right . Bye-bye . [ Phone Beeping ] Three with no sugar , three with no milk and four with no sugar and no milk . No sweat . Hey , hurry up . The big shots are waiting . If I wanted to be a waiter , I would have gotten a job at McDonald 's . You know , if things carry on like this , I swear I 'm quitting . I just don 't understand . Who the hell put that pinhead in charge ? She should have given us all a break and go back to that typing pool where she belongs . [ Cell Phone Playing Tune ] Hello ? Kurt ? What 's up , dog ? Where are you ? The Jumbo . What do you mean , I don 't know where the Jumbo is , man ? Are you on crack ? Yeah , I 'll be there in an hour , okay ? All right . All right . Later . Bye . Right . I 'm outta here , guys . See ya . Jumbo . I 'll be there . Jumbo . Sugar , milk , no milk , no sugar . [ Hysterical Laughter ] Cheers ! Tell me . Your robot needs a little fine tuning , to say the least . So how ya gonna compete with the American machine , huh ? Hmm . Hmm . Uh , you tell him , huh ? Listen , the American machine is no match for us . What we have is the most advanced piece of robotry on the planet ! Just one strike ... and it 's over ! Oh ! We 've waited three years for this chance . And now the time has come . For what ? Comrade ... this is top secret national security ... [ Clears Throat ] Uh , but why ? [ Computer Voice ] The projected draw for the lottery ... is 92 , 73 , 48 , What 's up ? 34 , 2 7 ... Nothin ' . Why don 't you put it in the lobby ? Why ? I hear they 're short of a few trash cans . 92 , 73 ... [ Chattering ] [ Sighs Deeply ] [ Thumps ] [ Man ] Yeah ! Hyuh ! - [ Grunts ] - [ Muzzle Pops ] [ Hooting , Yelling ] Yeah ! Come on ! Come on . Yeah ! Whoo-hoo ! Whoo-oo ! Oh , shit . Oh , yeah . Come on . [ Man ] Man , are you crazy ? [ Woman ] You guys ... Sorry , sorry . It 's only a game . - What 's up , my man ? - Kurt , what are you doin ' here ? Just here to visit an old friend . What else ? Five whole years , man . What 's the deal , man ? Okay , I surrender ! What do you want ? Whoo-hoo ! [ Edison ] Look at this shit . Still the same old Kurt , huh ? Still can 't handle losing . Goddamn ! What 's up with the hair , huh ? Shee-it . What the hell was he thinking ? Don 't play , Kurt . You know what happened to him . Yeah . He killed himself . What really happened to him ? He was clean . He was a good cop . Some assholes kept some money from a bust ... and somebody had to take the rap for it . And unfortunately , it was Steve . He left you hanging , huh ? Leave it alone , Kurt . Okay , I just never thought you 'd become a cop , that 's all . Me neither , man . Me neither . But enough about me . How you ? How 's your family ? Family ? No more family . Just me , the main man , sitting here . Looking out for number one . Well , hey , anyways , I heard you got into that high-tech design shit , man . You must be makin ' millions . Balling , baby ! [ Sucks Air ] The cash was good . It was sweet for a while . But the faster you build it ... the faster they 're gonna steal it . Dope ! Can I keep it ? [ Chuckles ] Hey , so you 're saying someone stole your design , huh ? Right . Same person I came down here to terminate . [ Laughing ] Well , hey . If you need a cap peeled or a body buried , I 'm your man . - For real ? - For real . Well , shake on it then , my boy . All right . Oh , yeah ! I knew I had to come back to Hong Kong ! This is where my real friends are , huh ? Oh , yeah . Where my real friends are , huh ? All right . Yo . Yo , get off me , man ! [ Edison ] Hey . Kurt ! [ Groans , Sighs ] [ Man ] Three , five , four . Seven , eight , six , seven . [ Counting Continues , Indistinct ] Hey , man . Where are you going ? All right , ignore me . Everything 's going according to plan . We 'll be done in five minutes . What the hell 's he doing ? All units , code red ! I repeat , code red ! [ Man Continues Counting , Indistinct ] [ Ringing ] Hello ? Kurt ? - It 's payback time ! - What the ... Oh , my God ! [ Whirring ] Yeah , bingo ! Edison , you are the man . [ Screaming ] [ Groaning ] [ Single Bullets Clanging Off Robot ] [ Grunting , Screaming In Pain ] Oh , God . Let 's go ! [ Loud Whirring ] Bye-bye , Doctor ! [ Whirring ] [ Screaming ] Oh , no ! [ Breathing Hard ] Robot 's gone . [ First Man ] Target ahead . All units , take aim . [ Man # 2 ] Hold your fire . We can 't afford to damage the robot . We can 't take responsibility . Report its position . [ Man ] Target immobilized . No further activity . Over . [ Man # 3 ] Sir . Nobody seems to be able to control it . What do we do ? [ Man ] It 's moving ! [ Man # 2 ] All right . Fire ! [ Bullets Clanging Off Robot ] [ Mechanical Voice , Indistinct ] Bullshit . [ Screaming ] Come on . Goddamn it ! [ Both Screaming ] [ Groans ] Come on ! [ Screaming ] [ Man ] Police ! Freeze ! Don 't move ! My , oh my . [ Loud Whirring ] - Stay back ! - [ Gunshots ] What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? - Keep away ! - Freeze ! Don 't move ! F.B.I. ! - This is not my fault ! - You have no way out ! Drop the gun ! And let your men shoot me ? They won 't shoot unless you force them to shoot . Don 't shoot , man ! You shoot , I shoot ! Edison , just tell us what 's happening . Why did you kill Quincy ? What ? You mean you killed an F.B.I. Agent ? I don 't know what 's goin ' on with me . - I can 't remember . - Bullshit . Drop the gun and give yourself up . [ Tires Screeching ] Hey , Edison ! Come in here ! Let 's go ! Move it , man ! Hurry up ! Move , move , move ! Come back here , you bastard ! Where are they going , you son of a bitch ? Gentlemen , we need some answers , and we need some answers now . Oo-hoo-hoo , yeah ! Hmm . Listen to me . The robot is mine . I designed it . And they stole it ! We 'rejust making things right right now . Yeah . But did you have to kill all those people back there ? I am only going after Cameron . Whoever gets into the crossfire , it 's not my fault ! - It 's real people , Kurt . - $ 200,000,000 , Edison ! What are you gonna do ? Turn me in , now ? Come on , give a rest . Get real ! No , you get real . There 's still time . You can turn yourself in now . What are you ? Insane ? Jesus ! They want you dead ! If we go back now , both of us will be finished ! Enough of this bullshit ! Let 's finish this , clean ! It 's not your call right now , Mike . Back off , Mike ! It 's not your call ! [ Mike ] Son of a bitch ! [ Machine Gun Firing ] Jump ! [ Screams ] Goddamn ! Shit ! Don 't you have a room with a bath ? Sorry , pal . Full today . What 's the number for room service ? Shout long enough , we may hear ya . Match , what do we do now ? You got me beat . We didn 't even get a call to our lawyer . What 's going on ? We 're both innocent ! Ah , who cares ? Let them fight among themselves . Maybe they 'll fix Edison , while they 're at it . Yeah , you 're right . But I 'll never , ever get used to the bars on the window . It 's no problem . Just pretend you 're at a wildlife park . Hey ! I really like monkeys , don 't you ? The way they swing through the trees ? The robot is mine , I designed it , and they stole it ! [ Chuckles ] You 're one of the F.B.I. What are you doing ? Nothing personal . Your buddy 's orders . [ Grunting ] Just leave me alone , okay ? I can 't . I still have to take you in . What 's wrong with you ? You already know I 'm being framed . I don 't know anything ! Except that you 're involved . Fine . Believe what you want . I don 't have time for this bullshit . What I believe doesn 't matter . They 're still gonna come after you . If you 're innocent , you turn yourself in . This is Hong Kong , my town , my turf , my business . And I 'm not goin ' back until I take down Kurt . Hey ! Take off or take a bullet ! Your call . You think I won 't ? I already shot one F.B.I. Today . I can shoot another . Okay . You can go after Kurt , but I 'm coming with you . That 's my job . Your security would be a joke ... except the punch line was that we lost one of our best men . Agent Curtis , our police force is one of the most disciplined in the world . This was just a ... and isolated incident . That " isolated incident " cost Agent Quincy his life . And it left dozens of other people wounded or dead ... and our agent is missing . All that matters now is that we find RS1 . Losing the robot is not an option . Superintendent Gao , I respectfully request ... that you allow me to put my own team on the case . Impossible . This is Hong Kong . It is outside yourjurisdiction . I 'm sorry , but our State Department 's already conferred ... with your Chief Executive Office . Gentlemen , it 's a done deal . This is ridiculous ! He 's such a dumb shit . This is amateur night . Are you the highest-ranking officer here ? Yeah . Yes . Okay , then I 'm talking to you . I expect full cooperation , including a space for a command center ... and access to your computer system . From here , we 'll hard-target the suspect . All the Hong Kong Police need to do ... is stay out of our way and we 'll have this thing wrapped up by sundown . [ Clears Throat ] Excuse me . Sir , you saw the tape , right ? Okay . Well , Match and Alien , I mean , they 're just kids ! There-There 's no need to hold them , right ? No problem here . What ? The F.B.I. ' s main focus is to reclaim the robot . [ Sighing ] Thank you . Just find a way to get to this Edison guy . Right now , he 's the only lead we have to RS1 ... and RS1 ' s all this game 's about . [ Sighs , Scoffs ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Pretending To Groan ] Now that you 're back from your little travel ... I 'd like to return to you the personal effects that were taken from you on your arrest . " Cyber Business " ? Match Fung , Director ? My ass ! It 's true . " My left eye is in love with your right eye . " [ Chuckles ] Give me that ! [ Continues Chuckling ] It 's a love letter . From my Internet lover . Listen guys , we checked out the security videos , and we now know what happened . Ma 'am , I don 't care , 'cause I 'm resigning from tomorrow . [ Scoffs ] Why can 't you wait until I 'm finished talking ? - I 'm gonna need your passports . - What ? You two guys are the main suspects . And if you don 't find RS1 and Edison , you 're gonna carry the can ! [ Both Laughing ] Are you kidding ? [ Boat Horns Blasting ] It 's a little early for dinner , don 't you think ? I 'm looking for a man-sized lobster . A man-sized lobster . Okay . Did you hit your head on something when we dove into the water ? [ Match ] Hello ? [ Man ] Where the hell have you been ? I hope you remembered we have a new presentation to make for the new shareholders . All the big cheeses will be there . If you don 't show , we 're screwed . No dot-com , no job , nada . Okay ? No sweat . Kimmy-poos ? I haven 't been on the net for a few days . My days are full of clouds without you . Miss you , miss you , miss you , love you . [ Kisses Phone ] The weather 's been great . - So what ? - So what 's all this crap about days being cloudy , huh ? [ Alien ] It 's poetry , you asshole . What do you know ? Where do you think Edison might be , anyway ? [ Match ] Remember what you said on the phone ? " Oh . Jumbo . I 'll be there . Hmm . " Lobster ? No , I 'm sorry . Out of season . Prices too high . I got crab , good quality . Not lobster . A guy who goes by the name of " Lobster . " Do you know him ? Lobster ? Yeah , sure . His real name 's Lymon . That 's his boat over there . One day , somebody will teach him a lesson ! All right , so I get it . This lobster thing is a ... person ? Hey . Is that him ? [ Mumbling ] I need another drink . I need another drink ! You owe me another one . A double ! Come on . Give me one . I can take it . Hey . What 's the matter with you ? Come on , drink up ! [ No Audible Dialogue ] Hey ! Come on , wake up ! [ Laughing ] - Come on . - Who were those guys the other night ? - [ Laughing ] Make him drink ! He must drink . - Hey ! Snap out of it ! Okay , I 'll drink ! [ Laughing Continues ] Hey . Hey , man ! You sure fooled the F.B.I. , but not us . You 're coming with us . I 've got to find Kurt first . - I can 't go back . - [ Laughs Incredulously ] Hey , Alien . If you ever steal something and kill a guy ... just tell the cops when they arrest you ... " Oh ! I just have to go off to Mexico , or Europe , on vacation first . " You got that ? You think we 're retards ? Yeah , you got some explaining to do . Wait a minute . Edison told me he was hypnotized , which means ... somebody used him to activate the robot . Could be . Bullshit . Don 't believe me ? I 've got a witness . Hey ! Hey ! - What 's goin ' on ? - [ Speedboat Motor Revving ] Freeze ! [ Screaming ] Help ! Help ! Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Something 's up . We have to go . Where is he ? You see him ? Get going ! Bye-bye ! [ Laughing ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] [ F.B.I. Man ] Get him ! [ Woman ] lan , no ! We need him alive ! Lymon , what 's going on ? Are you in trouble again ? I don 't believe it ! All right , Grandma , just shut up ! I 'll explain it to you later . Hey , thanks a lot . Aw , you 're welcome . One good turn deserves another . We 're quits . The guy who rented your boat , where is he ? I don 't know . Look , I just thought they wanted the boat for a party . I never thought they would ... You know what I mean . You need to lay low for a while . Those guys are F.B.I. Agents . I need your help . I don 't believe this ! The F.B.I. Too ? No . Look , I really don 't know anything . Honest . Porky introduced me to the foreigners . He works over at the Hop Hing warehouse . I just wanted to make a few bucks extra . Hop Hing warehouse , huh ? Thanks a lot . Wait . Take these . My car 's in the parking lot . I won 't need it . And don 't get stopped ! It 's stolen ! I shouldn 't wear green ! It brings bad luck ! [ Sobs ] What the hell were you doing back there ? Can 't you even drive a stupid boat ? Goddamn that Edison ! Yeah , and goddamn the F.B.I. ! Troublemakers ! Hey , where are you going ? What did I say ? Hey , cool it , will you ? Hey ! Come on ! You wanna step outside ? [ Laughs ] You 're a stupid jerk-off ! Come on . Let 's go . Yeah ? Aren 't you in enough trouble already , assholes ? Us ? You guys broke laws that we don 't even have yet . Yeah , keep flapping , dickhead . You 're the one ... going to the bamboo Alcatraz . Oh ? For what ? Uh . Illegal diving ? Refusing to bleed ? [ Scoffs ] Thank God you Americans ... can 't shoot for shit . Yeah , let 's go ! Come on ! Ya wanna go ? Come on ! Ian ! [ Indistinct Shouting ] Stop it ! That 's enough ! Let 's get some order here right now ! This is a hospital . You should know better . Laugh while you can , gentlemen . What did you say ? I said laugh while you can , buddy ! You two , get out ! We 've got you for abetting and aiding a fugitive . He was your partner . If we lose him and the robot ... it 's down to you two guys . Roseanne Barr Arnold will be ... President of the United States of America ... before you two punks see the light of day . So you really don 't know where Edison is ? Edison ? What about our own people ? We had injured agents in the water back there , lan . They weren 't the priority . They weren 't your priority . And they should 've been . What is it with you and Edison ? What are you talking about ? We have videotape of him stealing the robot and killing Quincy . Maybe it 's not what it seems . No , what it seems is that you need to get your mind back on this mission ... which is to take this guy down hard . You 're so convinced it 's him . Why ? Why won 't you think of any other possibilities ? What possibilities ? You don 't have anything . No evidence , no witnesses . Nothing . Just some half-assed conspiracy theory based on the fact ... that a guy you think is cute couldn 't possibly be crooked . That is not where I 'm coming from ! You need to put your head on straight , Jane . All right ? Otherwise , you 're on the next plane home . No one 's going anywhere . Not until we see this thing through . Jane , are you all right ? Good . Then we don 't need to waste any more time here . So ? We go home now ? What 's up with you ? Don 't you understand the shit we 're both in ? Just concentrate on finding our friend Edison , okay ? I found this . Any good to you ? I picked it up at the convention center . He dropped it . [ Laughs ] And I found it . [ Groans ] Moron . What do you want ? We want to know ... if it 's possible to trace that E-mail address . Is it ? Yes , that shouldn 't be too difficult . We 'll have to wait till he logs on , then we 'll be able to trace him . It 's a routine job for us . Peggy 's our expert . She 'll be able to find him , if he 's hiding out there . And as it 's for you , Alien . I 'm sure she 'll be delighted to help you guys out . Wait a minute . I know you 're just winding me up . So cut it out ! You don 't believe me ? Take a look . You can check it out yourself . How 'd she get these photos ? She didn 't even go to that barbecue . That 's right , but I was there . Look , if I sold them , it was for your own good . What did she pay you ? Where 's my commission ? Only if you convince her to help . I 've got a steady girlfriend , remember ? And she loves me . Get out of here , man . You 've never even met her . Shitbag ! How much ? Hi ! Hi ! Still working , huh ? Must be busy . Not too busy to go out , if you ask me . Funny you should say that . I need to find the guy behind this E-mail address . Easy . Move closer . But I can see the screen from here . Forget it . This close ? Uh-uh . Uh ! Ugh . Heee ! Hey , we 're getting some food to go . You want anything ? I 'll have whatever Alien 's having . I see . And what is Alien having ? Hot curry pork pie , no drink . Two curry pork pies for the lovebirds . [ Beeping ] [ Gulping . Groaning ] [ Retching ] Hey , it sure is hard , but you 'll get over it , okay ? Come on . Come on . [ Panting ] Don 't Let Your Eyes Fall In Love With My Long Hair . It 's his latest book . You-You mean you read his books ? I 've read all his books . I 've recommended them ... to all my friends in the chat rooms . What ? You mean to say you log in to chat rooms ? I use the net every day . I chat up the guys in the chat rooms . It 's like it says in that book ... " Women don 't just use their eyes to attract their lover boy . " And what nickname do you use on the chat room ? [ Groans ] [ Buzzing , Twittering ] Where the hell is Kurt ? He went upstairs to crash for a while . He better get his ass in gear ! The buyer 's flying in tonight ! We got two hours to finish this shit ! What are you , sleeping ? Get up ! Get up ! Get outside ! [ Beeping ] Got it ! It 's a warehouse in Tuen Mun . Tuen Mun ? Come on ! Thanks a lot . [ Beeping ] [ Bellowing ] What is wrong with you people ? Move ! You freaking blind or what ? I don 't understand . You told us to wait until it finished scanning . Someone 's hacked into my computer ! Don 't start giving me shit , Kurt ! This is your fuck-up ! I 'm calling the boss . Just exactly which word in the sentence you don 't understand , Vierry ? We 're being hacked , which means we can be traced . Which means we have to get out of here , now ! Pack it up . Pack it up . Pack it up , now ! Let 's go ! [ Snarls ] I don 't know what the hell 's going on . Fucked up . Somehow , they traced it . Hurry up ! I don 't know . Kurt told me . Whatever . Fucking get it together . We 're gonna be heroes . What 's up with you ? Hey , I 'm drowning my sorrows , okay ? Well , I 'll get over it . I can 't wait . I 'm very , very goddamn hot , man . Let me go . I 'm really ready to die , you know ? You may be ready , but I 'm gonna nail these assholes first , man . How could she have lied to me ? [ Whimpers ] Those bastards ! We 'll need backup . * Uh-huh-huh * My man . How come you got in here so early , huh ? Seems to me I 'm right on time . I had this weirdest dream ever , man . You wanna hear about it ? Give it up , Kurt . Dream time 's over . You know , it was in this strange corridor . I had two guns in my hands , and people were shooting at me . Shots went off everywhere . It was crazy , I 'm telling you . And it was so cool . You know why ? 'Cause not a single bullet ... not a single one hit me ! 'Cause I be Superman ! Oww ! I was shooting and laughing and blowing the shit out of them . There were pieces of bones and brains ... and the blood just burst out right onto the wall . Whoo ! Just look at that . What a pretty graffiti . And you ! And you just pop out of nowhere ! And you had this gun pointed right on my head ! But I couldn 't shoot you . You know why , huh ? 'Cause you 're my man . We used to back each other up . I 'll never forget that . This is no war game , Kurt . This is real life . Let me take you in now before it 's too late . [ Scoffs ] It 's already too late . [ Grunts , Yells ] Come on , Edison ! You wanna take a walk with me on the wild side ? You 're a wanted man now , remember ? You know what , Kurt ? You really messed up , man . Hey , yo , yo , yo ! You wanna know the real reason ... I couldn 't kill you in my dream ? I ran out of bullets , baby ! - [ Yells ] - [ Grunts ] [ Yells , Exaggerated Howling ] [ Howls , Grunts ] [ Grunting , Groaning ] [ Grunt ] Help ! Bastard ! Bastard ! Help ! [ Laughing ] Hey , man , I 'll give you a drink , okay ? - Don 't kill me , please ! - Hey , man . Help ! Help ! - Whoo ! Whoo ! - You ! Come on ! Come on ! [ Yells ] Help ! [ Groaning ] - [ Yells ] - [ Grunts ] - Wahhh ! - Uh ! Ohhh ! You bastard ! Bastard ! Bastard ! You bastard ! - Hyahh ! - Ohh ! [ Clattering ] You bastard ! [ Yells , Grunts ] [ Yelling ] [ Grunts , Groans ] - [ Snarls ] - [ Both Grunting ] Whoo ! Yeah-haw ! Yeah ! Yeah ! The robot ! We hit the jackpot ! - [ Laughing ] - [ Grunting ] - [ Groaning ] [ Fierce Yell ] Some cops can be so inefficient . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Howling , Grunting ] [ Both ] Eh ? Hey , forget about it . We found the robot , didn 't we ? Hey , wait . What about Edison ? We don 't give a shit about Edison . Don 't we ? But the boss said find Edison or we get the chop . No , no , no . The boss said we gotta find the robot or we get the chop . I don 't think so , man . Hey ! [ Both Yelling ] Uahhh ! [ Screaming ] Hey , what the hell 's going on ? [ Yells ] [ Device Beeping ] Unit B , target in sight . Location ? We 're at the center of the warehouse . Over . Hoo-uh ! Uhhh ! [ Yelling ] [ Clanking ] [ Yelling ] - He-Hey ! [ Screams ] - [ Yells ] [ Groans ] [ Beeping ] Hyahh ! [ Pursuers Grunting ] - Hold on ! - Ah ! Ahhh ! [ Tires Screeching ] Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh ! [ Screaming ] Ohhh ! - [ Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] [ Yells ] [ All Yelling ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Grunting ] Whoo ! Yeah ! Where did your people get to ? I don 't know . They never called in . Oh , no ? Should we take a body count while we wait ? It 's the second bloodbath they 've caused . I want some answers here . If it wasn 't for them , we 'd have never found that place . So what ? How do we know they weren 't just setting us up ? Whoever is setting this place up , it 's based in the States . It 's obvious . They were just using Edison to get to RS1 . Is it ? Wow ! Really ? Yeah ! 'Cause the only thing obvious to me is how far you 'll bend the rules ... in order to avoid taking the rap . Okay , listen , I don 't wanna play the heavy , but we 're running out of options here . If RS1 gets taken out of Hong Kong ... it 's the Bureau that 's gonna take the heat . Now , I 'm under just as much pressure as you are . [ Woman On Radio ] And some news just in . Police sources have confirmed that an anti-terrorist operation ... carried out this morning involving a number of units ... resulted in five officers 'deaths . [ Laughing ] The cops got their asses kicked . It 's about time someone taught ' em a lesson . With any luck , that 'll shut ' em up for a while . - That 's great news . That 's made my day . - Shut up ! Why ? What 's the matter ? We 're cops . I heard them talking about closing the deal last night . They 're shipping it overseas . Look , don 't you want to solve this case ? I thought you guys had guts . What happened ? Come on . Look , pal , we 'll do it our own way , okay ? Hey , can 't you go any faster ? Look , I 'm doing 60 . It 's fast enough . I got enough problems without more tickets . Is it true you got guts , mister ? I thought to be a policeman ... you had to have a small brain and lots of guts . [ Chuckles ] My pals call me Braveheart . You know , like the movie ? [ Chuckles ] You see , I 've got guts . Of course , I 'm not a cop ... because I got a big brain . [ Chuckles ] I 'm just joking , you know ? No offense . [ Laughs ] Hey , how 's your big brain , huh ? And your guts . Hope you 're feeling okay . You bastards , always beating up on innocent people . Now I know what they mean by police brutality . Why don 't you catch crooks instead of wasting our money ? I don 't blame a bunch of terrorists for trying to blow you up . You deserve it all if you ask me . You 're all jerks , every one of you ! You 're no good for anything , except for beating up on taxi drivers . Disgraceful . You wait ! I 'll get even one of these days ! [ Man ] Hey ! [ Woman ] Whoo ! All right , guys ! Good job ! Madam , Match and Alien just brought in Edison . Okay . Thanks . They 're here . [ Cheering ] [ Cheers Continue ] That 's great , guys ! Great job ! Madam , they 're coming up . Why the hell do I get the feeling we 're doing the wrong thing here ? You 're off the hook now , right ? There you go . I know , but still . Match , if we work together , we can solve this case . So are you up for it ? Sir , they 're not here . Nothing . Oh , really ? [ Indistinct Chatter ] Find them ! Find them ! Listen , I 'm taking a gamble . If this doesn 't work , then I 'm taking you in . What are we gonna do ? Huh ? He said he 'd been hypnotized and programmed with the RS1 code . So if we can search his memory , we 'll be able to access the activation code . We 're going to use a computer to repeat the process . What do we do with the code ? The code will then enable me to localize the robot . That 's what it 'll do ? Mm . [ Keyboard Clacking ] Hey , don 't you have a meeting tonight ? I did . Never mind . - Recall program started . - Uh ... The following sequence will repeat the original hypnosis . Commence . [ Hissing Static ] Bingo ! We found it ! That 's great . Can you feed the code into my laptop , Peggy ? No problem . With any luck , we 'll soon have our hands on the robot . [ Whirring ] Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Stay cool . We 'll be there in an hour . Goddamn it ! Thanks . You ! Don 't try me . Kung fu ! Wahhh ! Just kidding . We found the robot . If we don 't hurry , it 's gonna be too late . Look , if you 're gonna arrest us , arrest us now . Otherwise , move aside and get this goddamn thing over and done with ! Jane . One last chance . Right . One last chance to die . Get down ! The computer shows they 're in the container terminal . Stop here ! Where you going ? To call in for backup ! What 's up ? How come the robot 's on ? Ah , shit ! Looks like someone used a remote program to activate our robot , huh ? It 's time to call the man . The cops are on their way . We gotta move . All right , just make it fast ! He cut the power . He must know we 're onto him . Ross , I 'm at the pier , dock four . The robot 's here . I need backup . You got it . I 'm on my way . And Jane , be careful . Mr. Achmed . Welcome . Cut the bullshit . Show me your precious robot soldier . [ Snoring ] Hey , what are you guys doing here ? Get up ! I 'm gonna need your dream machine to neutralize the RS1 . To what ? To neutralize the RS1 . Neutralize what ? Leave us alone ! We don 't even have a hotel room . Get lost ! Haven 't you seen the time ? I 'm sorry , but if you guys don 't help us , Hong Kong will be destroyed ! Then you better kiss your ass good-bye . See that ? That robot of ours there ... was designed for peaceful applications only , not violence . Good night . [ Snoring Resumes ] Don 't do this ! We need your help ! It is perfect , my master . Good . Hey , my favorite double agent . I thank you , my country thanks you . Your price is worth ... I always told people that you 're the best . And now it 's time to prove it . All my genius , my anger I put into you ... my iron brother . And soon , the whole world 's gonna know your name ... [ Whispers ] and fear you . There . The four hundred million just moments away . Easy money , eh ? [ Chuckles ] Easy money . - [ Grunting ] - [ Groans ] F.B.I. ! Police ! Freeze ! No , no , no ! Nobody moves ! Show me your hands ! - Your hands ! - Hey , let 's make a deal . Deal ? [ Giggles ] No deal . Get ready for some serious jail time , guys . That hurts , man . You know the rules of the game . You gotta tag me to win . Come on . Right here . You broke the rules and you played yourself out . You 're just lucky . I 'd never shoot a friend . Freeze ! F.B.I. ! Everybody stay calm ! Everybody stay where you are ! Very good job , Jane . Hey ! Good timing . I never thought I 'd actually be happy to see you . Sir , where 's the rest of our team ? What about the local police ? They 're on their way ... to a different location . - What ? - He means they 're not coming . Hands up ! I told you I had it covered . Cover us earlier next time . You bastard ! I can 't believe it was you . That was the whole idea . [ Chuckles ] I 'll deal with you punks later . Mr. Achmed . Let 's get down to business . Whatever you say , brother . Our deal is done . It 's a pleasure doing business with you . [ Laughing ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Fearful Cries ] Hey , Ross , it 's over ! Drop your weapons ! Hey , partner ! How did you find me ? [ Laughs ] I put tracking devices in the police cars , a trick I learned from you . Seems you 've learned a little too well . Why 'd you do it , Ross ? How much money soaks up this much blood ? More money than even you could turn down . I 'm set for life ! - Can 't spend what you can 't keep , partner . - We 'll see about that ! Ah ! Ah ! [ Grunts ] [ Both Screaming ] - [ Yells ] - [ Grunts ] [ All Yelling , Grunting ] [ Sirens Approaching ] - Police ! Freeze ! - [ Tires Screeching ] Put your hands above your head , slowly ! * Toot * [ Whirring ] [ Machine Gun Fire ] [ Laughter ] [ Machine Gun Fire Continues ] Whoa ! Whoaaa ! [ Straining ] - Ahh ! - [ Chuckles ] You 're one smart guy . A little too smart to leave alive . - [ Yelling ] - [ Screams ] - [ Body Thuds ] - [ Both Grunting ] [ Both Laughing ] I think he 's dead . Yeah . [ Both ] The robot ! [ Tires Screeching ] [ People Screaming ] [ Footsteps Pounding ] No ! Stay back ! Stay back ! Call for backup ! Ready ! Aim ! Fire ! [ Policemen Groaning ] [ Grunts ] Hey , watch it , idiot ! Uhh ! [ Woman Screaming ] Watch out ! Move ! Get out of the way ! [ Whirring ] [ Gagging ] [ Imitating Chicken ] Try to stop this , now ! [ Snarls ] [ Yelling ] [ Both Yelling ] I told you you were the best , my brother ! Hey , yo , guys ! It 's not a test anymore ! It 's what I call graffiti time ! Come on ! Let 's go ! You 've won ! Oh , ho-ho ! Look what we have here , huh ? A robot rumble ? You filthy , capitalist , running dog ! Even without our party 's approval ... I 'm gonna personally rip you into tiny little pieces ! And when I 'm finished with you , you 're gonna regret the day that ... That 's right ! Hello ? Yes . You wait , mister ! What took you so long ? Where the hell were you ? Save it . This isn 't the moment . [ Robot : Indistinct ] Hey ? What you gonna do with that trash can ? Hey , stop calling my machine a trash can . - It 's about to save our skins . That 's right . - That thing ? D 1 0 1 0 malfunctioned because it was infected with a virus . If we can infect RS 1 with it , then the machine 's finished . I 'm sure we can do it . [ Twittering ] - [ D 1 0 1 0 ] Scanning . - [ Twittering ] Scanning . - Run ! - Huh ? [ Indistinct Shouting ] Hey , not so fast ! Uh , listen . I 'm sorry , comrade , but we can 't do anything to help you . We 've been recalled . We 're out of here . Our boss was quite clear on the phone . We have to leave right now . Here we go . See ? [ Robotic Footsteps Approaching ] [ Whirring , Buzzing ] [ Whirring ] [ Electronic Pulsing , Twittering ] [ Robotic Voice ] Do or die ! - [ Yelling ] - [ Explosion ] [ Humming , Creaking ] [ Whirring ] [ Laughing ] Oww !

'Cause I want the world to know I am a genius ! We 're invincible ! [ Robot Firing ] [ Agonized Screams ] We did it ! We successfully infected RS1 with the virus . - Now , with any luck , it should blow up . - It should what ? Yeah ! There should be a giant explosion ! - Now you tell us ? - We better get out of here ! You 're under arrest ! Get him ! - [ Yelling ] - [ Machine Gun Fire ] [ Yelling ] - Waaa ! - Aiyah ! Whoaaa !

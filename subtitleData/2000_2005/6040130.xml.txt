 Previously on Farscape ... I don 't see another option . Scorpius has the knowledge from my brain and i 'm not gonna let him shaft the Universe with it . I 'm going to stop Scorpius . Welcome . I grant you John , and your companions ... full diplomatic rights , immunities ... and courtesies whilst aboard this vessel . Those wearing the bracelets will feel each others pain . ... and if one is killed ? Both will be dead . Let 's test the jewelry . The rift between us is finally bridged . Scorpius stole your command ! I knew he squeezed you out of power . What else do you know ? You could have come back . I didn 't want to come back . Oh ... it 's magnificent . He 's harmless . His weapons have been deactivated . That ship 's biologics are on minimal auto-support . All its other systems are dead . These are design specs , right ? to create an external field that stabilizes a wormhole before entry . Your project ... has cost us dearly ... and wielded at nothing - The equations we need are in here . - Don 't touch me . You give me what I want , or I swear ... I will keep you alive so that you can witness your home worlds destruction ! And now on Farscape ... Look at it ! Get the hell off me you son-of-a-bitch ! You listen to me , John . I don 't care about your homeworld ; your entire species ! Live ; die ; means nothing to me ! What interests me ; is that they- - matter- - to you ! You think holding a frickin ' gun on my planet is gonna motivate me to help you ? I ... have run ... out ... of ... time ! Don 't stop ... let 's see how much pain you can take ! That Commandant bitch will return here anytime . I must be able to report success or she 's going to scrap my wormhole project . And soon the Scarrans. will rule. half. this. galaxy ! Oh , Grasshopper . You 're so screwed ! If I am screwed , John . Things around here are going to get very ugly . But if Grayza 's going to stop the experiment in a few days , then we have already succeeded . No . Scorpius is in Captain Queeg mode . Somebody 's stolen his strawberries and he 's not gonna let his pet project die . How 's he planning to stop Grayza ? We 're talkin ' about Scorpius . You prepared to bet against him ? Bialar you look tense . Let 's take a little steam in that restorative chamber . So we 're agreed . We stay no longer . We go . Agreed . Agreed . All right folks , gather round . New deal . This whole Commandant Grazer strong arm routine ... changes everything . We agree . This could all get nasty very quickly . Absolutely , but it might not be nasty enough to put a spike into Scorpy 's wormhole project once and for all . From the scuttlebutt on the ship- - this Grazer 's got Scorpius 's mivonks in one hezmana of a vise . Are we all on the same page here ? We came to permanently sabotage Scorpy 's project . Now , I 've been trying to kill it from the inside , but we have run out of time . We have one option left . Only one ... . We blow up the Command Carrier . Blow up ... the Command Carrier ? The entire Command Carrier ? All of Scorpy 's data is on this ship . He 's retro 'd the entire damned hull into a repeated necessary to stabilize a wormhole . This boat is the Peacekeeper wormhole project . But , this carrier 's huge . Over a metra long . Is it possible to blow up the whole ship ? It 's armed to the teeth . We can blow the munitions store . Hell , we can stick a banana in the tailpipe . I do not care how we do it , but we do it . There are over fifty thousand men , women and children aboard this ship . Then we find a way ... to get ' em off before we blow it up . John , there 's no way that we ... Is this not ... what we came here to do ? Crais- - you commanded this ship , can we destroy it ? It 's possible . I 'll need to see the specs on any modifications Scorpius has made , and any redistribution of power and fuel since I was in command . Good . We have a start and ... We will find a way to get the people off . Guys ... we can do this ... and we have to try . I did see what the Scarrans were able to do . Even if by some wild miracle , I manage to regain my throne , I won 't hold it for long if the Peacekeepers have this technology . I know what horrible destruction wormholes can wreak . Nobody should wield such power ... Nobody . I 'm on my way to the Leviathan Hybrid . Not anymore , Sir . The hybrid is dead . There is no reason to deny me access . Scorpius 's orders are my reason . This is all very pleasant John , but , ah ... shouldn 't we be working ? Or at least , well ... ... pretending to work ? Would he do it ? Hm ? Oh ! Would Scorpius actually attack earth ? If you fail in delivering the wormhole answers ... Would he set out on a sixty-cycle mission ? ! To destroy an insignificant planet ? Though I would never underestimate Scorpius 's resolve for retribution , John . If he feels he 's been ... No . Wait ... Hey- - took your hand off ! So , tell me John . If you do develop wormhole travel , and gain the ability to return home , would you really destroy that information ? Got any sixes ? Go fish ! Ha-Hah ! Glory Crichton Crichton , you 're no longer writing on the tablet . Oh my Jenset , look what you 've done . I ... I think you 've unlocked the fifth level coupling anomalies . So that 's how it works , I must get these figures plugged in immediately . We 're close . Oh Yes . I can do this . Disarming him was the final step towards his resurrection . Your experience with Talyn ... will be invaluable ... to making that happen . We must get you back aboard Talyn . They 'd never let me stay with him . We don 't know that . Not unless I have something to trade . Sir . I talked to Crais . You have something for me ? Yes . A demand . Get him out of my ... get him out of my sight ! I demand that I suffer no repercussions for any of my actions during exile . I demand assurances that the Leviathan hybrid will be resurrected that I will be leader of that project working alongside Lieutenant Larell ! Stop . Let him speak . You have something ... comparable , I assume . More than comparable . Any deal you strike with me may not prove enforceable once Commandant Grazer returns . If you delineate my requests in an Executive Order , signed while you are still in command of this vessel High Command must honor it ... no matter what dishonor you may endure . I accept your terms . Release him . Scorpius ... Crichton has no intention of helping you . He has determined that there is only one way to stop you and your experiments with finality . He is conspiring with some of Moya 's crew , to destroy ... this Command Carrier . Ow ... let me go ! Ow ... . ow ... Got an injury ? Let 's have a look . All right . Well , this may sting a little . When I was your age , do you have any idea how many times I was ambushed when I wasn 't ready ? Let me see . Hm ... Cadet , at service now . Henta . Let it bleed . Let it scar . You 'll want it . Go . Don 't make her soft , Aeryn . There 's so much you don 't know , Henta . What are you doing here ? We need to talk . There 's a problem . Follow me . We secured the information about the ship 's modifications . We got word on the lifepods . Great . Let 's get the information , get it to Crichton and get the frell outta here . The equations ... they 're flowing from you like a Walteran Fountain . This is wonderful , Crichton ! It seems your subconscious has blossomed . Despite yourself ... you are delivering the secrets that will allow me to succeed . And , ah ... no more distractions , John . Your plot against this ship has failed . Your friends ... are in custody . You are dead ! You are a dead man , Crais ! If Grazer insists that they all complete their sentences as prisoners , then so be it . No ! No , no . I forced them to do it . I demand you let ' em go if you want me to keep working ... You will demand nothing ! You give me my wormholes or , I swear ... I will kill them all ! We didn 't actually do anything . I mean , all they have is our intent . They 're Peacekeepers Jool . They 're not into justice . They 're into enforcement . Hey . Come on . We 've been in worse scrapes than this . I was a Peacekeeper prisoner for eight cycles . And I think that I spent every , single solar day trying to escape . Last time it took me a hundred and thirty cycles to escape . A hundred and thirty cycles ? Huh . I was lucky . You wanted to see me ? No . Stop it . It 's safe to talk here , and you need to hear this . I need to kick his ass ! He sold us out ! You can 't destroy this ship by simply throwing a few switches . So you set ' em up . No , Crichton , I did not . I needed the distraction , so that Scorpius would believe that the plot against him had failed . I kept Aeryn safe , because I need her . You should come up with a newer line . And you should listen to him , now . All that I have cared for have gone . My parents ... taken away from me , my brother dead . So now , I live , I plan , I do ... all in the service of my own interests . In that , I believe , I am not unique in the universe . Snap this up . I gotta get back . Despite all of this , I understand the power of the technology that Scorpius is attempting to harness . I understand the horror that will wash over this galaxy if anyone wields this weapon . And , last of all , I now know that I am the only individual capable of stopping him . Have fun . Listen . We all were on the same team . We all want this ship destroyed . And the only way to do that ... is with Talyn . Crais is proposing that he and Talyn Starburst while still inside the Command Carrier hangar . The Carrier will collapse upon itself ... outer decks first , central core last . It will take at least half an arn for the ship to fully implode . Giving the crew time to abandon ship . Tell me ... you believe this . Do you have a plan to destroy the ship ? Not yet . D 'Argo and the others are probably in a holding cell , and I can find them . Where do we meet up with you and Talyn ? You don 't . Starburst in a confined space , where the energy can 't dissipate ... It will be the hero 's death that Talyn deserves . You 're gonna die ? I will need a ... ah , significant distraction ... to keep Scorpius occupied . Crais I 'll get you one . Yo , Harrison ! Get your shoes on . We 're goin ' on a little trip to my module . But , dear Crichton ! You smell this ? Wormholes . We are this close . But you gotta get Scorpy to call off the watchdogs . - What 's happening ? - Nothing . You forget how well I know you . I can tell you 're about to do something . You do know me very well . If I suspect you 're conspiring against Scorpius , I must report it . Larell . If you suspect anything , you must report it . Do not be disloyal ... to Scorpius in any way . Tell me Tell Scorpius it 's not going to work . Next time he sends someone to spy on me ... send someone I care about ! Crichton ! Crichton ! We must hurry . Scorpius said we must not stay on Moya long . Yeah , yeah . I 'm on my way . Quickly , check the stabilizers . Moya understands . She says it is best this way . Talyn ... was always destined for a violent end . This then , at least , will be a noble one . We may never see any of you again . Pilot . Just be ready to Starburst if you don 't see us hauling ' ass towards you . You give Moya my love . and ... her love to you ... as well as mine . Check the nose cone . Co-Kura . Make sure those sensors are far away from the hetch drive . Attach one to either side . I allowed you to get this ... Primitive ship . How is it going to get me what I want ? Read the middle finger , Scorpy . I have a thought , forming in my head as to why this primitive ship , with no shielding , allows me to survive wormholes . I 'm gonna check it out . Which pilot is ready for deployment ? Whoa , no . No , no . Nobody flies it but me . One of your bozos screws up and bye-bye birdie . You could die , John . Yes , I could die . If I don 't kick this project in the ass before Commandant Cleavage gets back , she 's gonna execute me anyway , right ? What ? You worried if I turn to silly putty , so do you ? Why don 't you come with me ? Come on , Grasshopper . Come with me . You spent your life in search of wormholes , let me introduce you to one ... up close and personal . Unless , of course , you 're too scared . Co-Kura ? How are the sensors reading ? All sensor data flowing at maximum . All right , Scorp . You ready to rumble ? Oh , yes , John . We are approaching optimal attitude . All data ... still flowing . Entering the wormhole ... in ten microts . On my mark . Check your drag co-efficient , Crichton . Huh . What do you think ? This is without description , John . It 's a real Kodak moment . Sensor readings are starting to oscillate . Crichton , we 're detecting rantath flux . What is that , John ? I don 't know . You 're approaching the zone of possible instability . Alright , buckle up back there . We got a little problem . What is causing this , John ? You may not know it , sir , but my orders have been changed by Scorpius himself . He said if you tried to board the hybrid again , I was authorized to shoot to kill . Sensor readings . They 're all in the danger zone . Do you read me ? Crichton ? Commander Crichton ! Do you read me ? Can you read me ? Crichton Get me readings ! Are either of them still alive ? I 'm going to enjoy this command . Not as much as me . Co-Kura . We are experiencing ... heavy instabilities . Attempting to recoover . What is causing this , John ? Flying through wormholes ain 't like dusting crops , farmboy . It takes a little finesse . Okay , Co-Kura . We are stabilizing . Sensor reading confirm that . Now you go . I 've never felt this ... connected , John . You 're not goin ' all mushy on me back there , are ya ? The wormhole appears to be experiencing wave fluctuations . I ... I ... I strongly recommend that you fly clear and return to the carrier . Right . Yes , Talyn ... I am here No need to be afraid . Talyn ... the firing mechanism on your cannon ... was taken from you ... by the Peacekeepers . The rest ... have been captured . And Moya ... Moya will soon be enslaved unless ... we do something . Something radical . You and I ... together . You haven 't got your wormhole legs yet . Don 't worry . First time is the worst . Scorpius ... I am just making my final ... good-byes . Where are you , Crais ? I am standing in your heart and I am about to squeeze . Braca ... Find the source of this transmission , and arrest that fool . It 's coming from the hybrid , in the ... gamma hangar on level twelve . The hybrid 's powering up . You are the most repellant of creatures , Scorpius . You weren 't born into Peacekeepers . You weren 't ... conscripted against your will . You chose to be one . I want the bay doors sealed . All prowlers scrambled . That hybrid must not get away ! The hybrid 's building to maximum power , inside the hangar . I don 't think he 's planning to escape . The last time I left ... this ship ... My ship ... I did so under a veil of secrecy . You forced that situation . You took away my command . You stole my life from me . Well , this time Scorpius ... I am not leaving quietly . Somebody find that fool ... and get him out of that ship ! Somebody get that traitor off that ship ! I suggest you hang onto something . Talyn ... Starbust . What the frell ... ? Emergency . Emergency . D 'Argo . He 's done it . It 's going down . Yes , Moya . I see it . I see it . Let us out ! Crichton ! He 's done it ! He 's done it ! He 's killed the ship ! Yes ! But he 's also killing us ! We 're still frelling trapped ! I ... want ... out ! Clear the area ! Move it ! Move ! Evacuation procedures now ! We have to go . No ! I must save our data . This ship ... is dead ! The wormhole experiment is over , Co-Kura ... It 's for the best . You had something to do with this ! But you wanted this too ! More than you knew . To stabilize a wormhole . To tame it , to tame it 's power would have been the greatest scientific discovery anyone could imagine ! It is not ... just ... science ! It is never ... just science . It 's a weapon . It kills . And I will not let the Peacekeepers have it . Do you understand me ? Yes , I understand . But you still have the knowledge ... in your mind . Then , I 'll have to be very ... very careful . Can you get to an escape pod ? Commander ... Other than you , there is one receptacle which holds significant data pertaining to wormhole research . If he lives ... Scorpius will find me force me to tell him what I know . Damn . What 're we gonna do about that ? Only one thing to do . The Aurora Chair will erase all wormhole knowledge from my mind . Yeah , but ... Co-Kura , the chair won 't wipe what I know , and if it could ... I don 't know that I could do what you 're doin ' . You 're a brave man . D 'Argo Aeryn Chiana Aeryn ! This way ! Chiana Down here ! Down here ! We 're gonna be Boolite goo real soon ! It 's bent the bars ! Come on , Chiana , let 's go . Sir ! Attention Personnel . This is Scorpius . The Command Carrier is collapsing in on itself . Priority One escape procedures for the entire ship , are now in effect . Braca ... Come with me ! Crichton , are you still with Co-Kura ? Yeah , Aeryn . You okay ? Yes , The others are attending to business and then we should be seeking transport . Do not wait for me . I 'm gonna get to the module . I 'll meet you back at Moya . Crichton It would have been nice to know it could have been done . Pilot Pilot , can you hear me ? D 'Argo ! Is that you ? This Command Carrier is blowing to bits . And we can not get an escape pod off . I need transportation out of here now ! What do you want me to do ? Patch me through to my ship . Doing it now . Voice activation ... On Weapons and defense shields ... activate . Prepare for rescue retrieval . Officer Sun ! Drop your weapon . You did this , didn 't you ? You and your fellow traitors . There are fifty thousand of us . We gave you enough time . Most of you will survive . Most . I know that by destroying this ship I am saving millions of lives , Henta . Too bad you can 't save yourself . D 'Argo , Moya 's scans are rising to critical . If we 're not away from here when the Command Carrier implodes , it will destroy Moya ! We 're on our way , Pilot . Give us sixty microts ! Looks like our partnership is over . John Crichton . Commander John Crichton . Generations will know that name . Because of you ... very soon now , the Scarrans will destroy us . One evil at a time . That 's the best I can do . Tell me . Ghandi ... You still goin ' after Earth ? To what purpose ? Vengeance against you ? The only vengeance I cared about is no longer within my grasp ! While holding two lights , depress 3-1-7 , then release . Hold two . Press 9-1-1 and release . We were close . If we 're gonna get off this boat , now would be a good time . I may not be getting off this ship , John . Good-bye Crichton . Scorpius . The others are on D 'Argo 's ship . I 've taken a prowler and I 'm leaving now . On my way . Aeryn ? What ! Fly safe . We all knew the time would come when we 'd split up . In the beginning , I would never even have believed it could take so long . Don 't think I 'm gonna to miss you . Any of you . I 'm not . Well , maybe a little bit . What are you going to do , Chiana ? I think I might ... I might try and find the Nebari Resistance . Should we manage to reunite you with your people ... will you be leaving us ? From what I can tell Pilot , I won 't be the only one leaving Moya soon .

 [ Man ] Previously on The Pretender . - Have we met ? - Thomas Gates . Friends call me Tommy . I don 't have any friends . Everything that I 've ever done or felt ... it was wasted because you weren 't part of it . Thomas ? - I find it hard to believe ... - Thomas ? that somebody breaks into your house , shoots your lover point blank in the head . - Oh , my God . - At least I know how to protect the ones I love . The man the police think killed Thomas Gates died of a drug overdose in his cell . Daddy , this man was the last link in proving who killed Thomas . I don 't want any trace of Centre involvement . They killed them all . And for what ? - What will you do now ? - Find out who did this and make them pay . [ Miss Parker ] Tell me about yourself . - What do you want to know ? - Everything . [ Gates ] Bridget seems like a nice person . If it 's making you this miserable , maybe you should stop spending time with them . - They 're my family . - Maybe you should think about starting a new one . [ Miss Parker ] There are places in me , Tommy . Dark places . If something is not right , we 'll deal with it . Together . I 'm a fix-it man , remember ? [ Gates ] I will make you a deal . When I die , I 'll leave you all my shirts . Hey , hey , hey , hey . I 'm not goin ' anywhere . Hmm ? [ Shower Water Running ] Parker ? Tommy . I love you , Parker . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Line Ringing ] - [ Sighs ] - [ Beeps ] Must be the 10th time I got her phone machine . [ Sydney ] You left the address , didn 't you ? Maybe Miss Parker will meet us here . Syd , she hates anyone to enter one of Jarod 's lairs before she does . [ Sighs ] It doesn 't make sense . - Something 's up . - Think back one year , Broots . - Thomas ? - Thomas ? Today ? It 's a year to the day that she found Thomas murdered at her house ? I 'm such an idiot . I left all those phone messages on her machine like it was just any other day . It is just any other day . Same clown . Different side show . I 'm sorry , Miss Parker . Thank you . So , what 's up with Jarod the jester ? Well , Syd and I have barely scratched the surface , if you want to start diggin ' in . [ Clears Throat ] Have Clean-up crate everything . If we can 't figure out what Jarod 's up to ... we can donate this stuff to a two-ring circus looking to add a third . We did find one thing . The celebrity clown of a local kiddie show , Marco the Magnificent ... was arrested yesterday on molestation charges . Police found him locked in a lion cage ... [ Chuckles ] with raw beef strapped to his - Anyway , well , it 's all in there . Ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls , I give you ... Ringmaster Jarod . What is it ? It 's - It 's Jarod 's twisted little model ... of my first meeting with Thomas . - Bastard . - I 'm sure there 's an innocent reason Jarod left it . Right . And O.J. was just chipping golfballs . All I 'm saying is - It 's bad enough he knows how Thomas and I met , but ... the fact that he left it for me on this day is no mistake . For once , admit he 's tormenting me just to torment me . And wherever he is , I just know he 's laughing . [ Nose Squeaks ] Hardly laughing . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . To houses skillfully turned into homes . To empty hearts filled up again . To new beginnings that might have been . All left with you , my love . Beautiful words . What , no confetti gongs , joy buzzers , squirting flowers ? - None of this is a laughing matter . - Yeah . No , you really caught me in a mood today . I 'm real tempted to put a cap in you ... wipe the slate clean on my life and take off without ever looking back . Your gun won 't work . I took the firing pin out last night . I sleep with this under my pillow . And you drool out of the left corner of your mouth . What the hell are you doing here , Jarod ? It 's time to take care of some unfinished business ... to find out who killed the man you loved and why ... and to pay respects to a man like Thomas Gates ... because he deserves it . Just because you 're a genius doesn 't mean you know what he deserves . Why are you tormenting me , Jarod ? Why do you even c-care ? [ Sydney ] Rumor5-8-2-5-9 ? [ Broots ] Yeah . Standard Centre coding logistics . In this case , " rumor " would be the code name of the operative in charge . As far as the numbers , I 'll have to talk to Manny . - You know the mute guy down in Communications ? - He , the one without a tongue ? Yeah . I guess it 'd be pretty pointless to play spin the bottle with a guy like that . I mean , if I was a woman . Anyhow , off hand I 'd say these numbers might be a code ... for a Centre audio phone tap file . Find out from Manny the marble mouth which one . Well , given the climate around here , Miss Parker , I don 't think that 's gonna be too easy . - Why ? - Oh , you haven 't heard ? Mutumbo 's dead , as in " Ding-dong , the wicked witch is . " Dead . Triumvirate 's crazy Zulu appears to have been murdered . - [ Mr. Lyle ] Two shots through the heart . - Small target . And whoever put the bullets in Mutumbo also gouged out his eyes . Like he saw something he wasn 't supposed to . Speaking of which , when was the last time you laid eyes on your father ? When is the last time somebody checked for your pulse ? - [ Giggling ] - [ Clears Throat ] Um - Now , now . I merely ask because family is the most important thing in the world . My family . Your family . The Centre family . Care to translate for Barney the dinosaur ? The gun that was used to kill Mutumbo ... was traced to the highest level of the Centre . A level that includes you , Mr. Lyle , and dear old dad ... who just happens to gain the most from Mutumbo 's sudden ... erasure . You think my father killed him ? Anyone could have . After all , when we miss the ones we love and survival 's at stake ... we 're capable of anything . Tommy . Talk to me , Parker . There 's something on your mind . I can tell . Yes . I - I - It 's okay . In your own time . Miss Parker . The search for your father has and will continue to intensify ... on my authority . He will be found . And when he is , those allied with him ... could find themselves endangered species . He was as much as accusing you of - hell , accusing me of participating in a coup . The least you could do is pretend to listen . Parker ? Call me ... when you 're back with the living . [ Miss Parker ] Do you believe in ghosts , Syd ? [ Sydney ] I believe in an afterlife . Second chances . I 'm talking about Thomas . His ... presence is all around me . Sometimes I hear my mother 's whisper of consolation ... my father 's laughter . Those we love ... are with us always ... in life and death . It 's more than that . I see him . Almost touch him . The anniversary of his death . Your father 's disappearance . Now Mutumbo 's assassination . Understress , the mind is capable of many things . It 's not my mind playing tricks on me . It is Thomas . He 's - He 's in the room with me ... like - like he 's waiting . Maybe he is . Maybe he 's giving you that second chance to complete something ... left unfinished . [ Phone Rings ] [ Beeps ] - Angel . - Daddy ? Are you all right ? - Better than anybody , now that Mutumbo 's , you know - - You ? Me kill him ? If I had , he 'd be missin ' more than his eyes . Daddy , they 're looking for you . - Cox . - Let him . My comeback plan 's workin ' . One more piece , and everything will be back to normal . - You sound different . - Damn straight . I 'm gonna be a father again . I haven 't felt like this since you were born . - Listen , we need to hook up . - Where ? I haven 't decided . Just keep your eyes open and your back covered . And , angel ? This turmoil ? It 's almost over . - The survivors will be together soon . - [ Line Hangs Up ] [ Scoffs ] " Survivors . " [ Broots ] As Manny explained to me , this code - You ... had a conversation with a tongueless mute ? No . [ Chuckles ] Not in so many words . But I - - Broots . - Okay . The phone tap ... was on Thomas 's phone . All of it was routed to an operative , code name Rumor . I still haven 't figured out who that is yet , but I was able to unscramble part of the call . And I-I-I downloaded it . Play it . [ Gates ] Yeah . Parker and I are goin 'away for the weekend , so we 'll talk when I get back . [ Jarod ] Okay , buddy . I 'll see you again soon . - [ Gates ] You take care , Jarod . - [ Line Clicks ] Tommy and Jarod ... were friends ? [ Gates ] Talk to me . [ Exhales ] - [ Shower Faucet Squeaks ] - [ Shower Water Running ] Tommy ? Tommy . [ Both Gasp ] Angel . Oh , geez . I thought I was gonna have a tub birth there for a second . - You okay ? - Yeah . - You look like you just saw a ghost . - No . I - - I 'm so glad you 're all right , Daddy . - I 'm just fine . It 's Brigitte we need to worry about . Yeah . Carryin ' a new life . It 's God 's ultimate challenge . How did you get here ? I didn 't see your car . Uh , we , uh , hitched a ride , came up the back path and used the key you gave us . Did I ? - I need a favor . - Anything . I want to help . Both of you . Yeah , good . We 're gonna have to help each other . I gotta have your car . He found a safe place for the birth . Yeah , we gotta keep movin ' for the baby . And a doctor we can trust for the delivery . - Daddy . - Hmm ? Tell me where you 're going . Please ? I just - I need to be a part of something positive right now . I can 't . It 's not safe . Listen , just because Mutumbo 's dead doesn 't mean his order to kill us is . You see , I think the hitter 's real close . - I think it 's Cox . - Well , it 's a pro , that 's for damn sure . That 's why you have to carry on business as usual . Now , it won 't be long . I 'm just one piece away from bein ' back ... runnin ' the Centre . - I can get you that piece if you just - - No , no . You can 't . I 'll have it real soon . - Now , give me the car keys . Come on . - There . - You take care of that brother or sister of mine . - I will . Come on . Let 's go . - [ Door Opens ] - Daddy ? Hmm ? What is Rumor 5-8-2-5-9 ? Beats the hell out of me . Rumor is a code name for the operative in charge of that file . - The rest sounds like a digital phone tap number . - Yeah . See ? We gotta help each other . Come on . Now remember , business as usual . [ Mr. Parker ] Remember , business as usual . [ Brigitte ] Rumor 's a code name for the operative in charge of that file . [ Gates ] Talk to me , Parker . There 's something on your mind , I can tell . [ Jarod ] It 's time to find out who killed the man you loved and why . [ Phone Rings ] - [ Rings ] - [ Click ] - What ? - Let 's hope there 's not a digital tap on this phone . It didn 't stop you and Tommy from becoming fast friends . - At least you 've deciphered some of what Rumor means . - I 'm just getting started . So why not save me some time ... and just tell me who killed him ? I don 't know . You listen to me , Jarod . The rules that you and I have been playing by - my indentured servitude to this house of horrors , you shaking your family tree - you just throw those the hell out the window when it comes to Thomas ! He is not a game ! I would never treat him like one . Deception was never my goal with you and Thomas . Your goal ? What goal ? [ Sighs ] Love . Putting you two together was one of the most rewarding things I 've ever done . Putting us together ? You 're a liar . We had a chance meeting in Blue Cove at a gas stat - You didn 't meet him after I did . You knew him before ? The way you felt about each other had nothing to do with me . I just - I just lit the torch . - [ Sobs ] - Miss Parker , are you there ? [ Sighs ] [ Sobs ] Tell me about the Tommy you knew . We met about a month before you did . I was working construction for one of his competitors - a greedy contractor whose selfishness cost a young man both his legs . Tommy helped you take him down . - Thomas was big on doing the right thing . - Yeah . I ... have to know who killed him , Jarod . As soon as I find out anything , you 'll be my first stop . But until then , everything inside of me says Rumor murdered Thomas . Follow that lead . And , Miss Parker , be careful . Rumors can kill you . [ Beeps ] Parker ? - Tommy . - Time to trust now , Parker . - But - - No . Trust Jarod . Trust him . [ Broots ] That 's funny . " Centre Voting Booth . Use handy lever to vote for most hated . " One flush , Mr. Lyle . [ Laughing ] [ Clears Throat ] " Two flushes , Mr. Raines . Three flushes , Mr. Cox . " - Hey , I guess it 's anybody 's election . - I 'm flattered . But I 'd hate to be the one to have to count the votes . [ Urinal Flushes ] Wouldn 't you , Mr. Broots ? There are rumors going around , Mr. Broots . Rumors ? Well , you are a washer , I hope ? Oh , yeah . Always . Before and after . [ Air Blowing ] So , uh - [ Clears Throat ] what kind of rumors ? It 's funny - these dryers bring back fond memories of Father 's mortuary . We employed similar devices in the preparation process . Oh . He used to let me help after school . If I was good . [ Chuckles ] I guess even the dead have to be clean . Oh , yes , because ... cleanliness is truth . Here . Please . [ Air Blowing ] You believe in truth , don 't you , Mr. Broots ? [ Clears Throat ] Sure . [ Sighs ] So , uh ... about this Rumor thing , I can explain - Cleanliness is truth . But that - that 's kinda hot . [ Chuckles ] Just like the crematorium . Now , what rumors are you hearing , Mr. Broots ? Oh ! [ Groaning ] Oh , my God ! [ Screaming ] [ Sighs ] Oh , that feels good . So , Broots , what did you tell Cox ? I screamed and told him that my hand was frying . About Rumor ! Well , as it turns out ... Mr. Cox wasn 't interested in the Rumor file at all . He just kept coming back to your father . His persistent interest in your father points to one thing . Yes . That Cox is the hitter hired by Mutumbo to kill Daddy . And Brigitte , maybe , as well as the baby . I 'm running out of time . So is Daddy . Anything further on Rumor , Broots ? Well , I was able to reach the end of the phone tap archive . And ? Nothing but a text message telling me the identity of Rumor is in a hard copy file . - Let 's find it . - No , no . I-I 'm working on it . It 's , uh - The file 's called a Z3 File . - Z3 ? - Yeah . Designates contract killings for hire . Makes it a lock . Thomas was murdered by someone inside the Centre . - [ Miss Parker ] Thanks for lending me your car , Broots . - No problem . Do you want me to stick around and keep you company for a while , Miss Parker ? Mmm , thanks ... but I don 't feel alone . It must be pretty hard still , though , huh ? Why does somebody have to die for us to realize all the things we never said to them ? Well ... I guess it 's ' cause we kinda treat life like a bug on the sidewalk . All we see is a bug , not a miracle . And no matter how hard we try ... we usually end up stepping ' on it ... instead of takin ' it into our hand . And the living are ... left with all the unfinished business . Until we finish it , yeah . You know , between Thomas ... and everything that 's happening with your father ... I just want you to know that ... I 'm here for you , Miss Parker . I-I mean , if you need someone . I-I mean , a friend . Miss Parker ? The Z3 Rumor file ? How did it get in here ? It 's not how it got here that matters . It 's who it says is Thomas 's killer . Who ? Revenge ? You should think about this , Miss Parker . Think about what ? Tommy was murdered . And his killer 's gonna pay . Thinking completed . Miss Parker . God help us all . Be careful , Parker . Tommy . Open up , Bridget ! [ Groans ] Angel . - It 's 4 : 00 in the morning . - Where 's Bridget ? - Oh , God , now where did she go ? - Don 't try to cover for her ! Where the hell is she ? She was here when I fell asleep . We had to leave our last hiding place . Decided to sleep in the car . - How did you find us ? - The car has a tracking system . Damn it . She 's been actin ' nuts the last couple of weeks , disappearing for hours at a time . Oh , my God , angel . She could be havin ' the baby . - Angel , what 's happened ? Why are you here ? - Thomas . Rumor 5-8-2-5-9 . Oh , God . Brigitte 's Rumor . - You knew nothing about this ? - Of course not ! She must have been followin ' Mutumbo 's orders . She killed Thomas . I 'm so sorry . [ Groans ] She 's carrying my baby . Daddy , think . Where would she go ? Now that Mutumbo 's dead , she 's not safe anywhere . - No , everybody has a safe place . Think . - What ? Well , there was a place . Let 's see , it was in the country , I think . I never knew where . But she kept a spare keying her desk at the Centre . I 'll find it , and I 'll find her . Then what are you gonna do ? Think about my baby ! [ Door Opens , Closes ] [ Bell Dings ] - What the hell are you doing here ? - Searching . Why ? Because you 're not the only one . With Triumvirate pressure , Cox has cranked up his search for Dad . And if they find any link to Mutumbo 's death ... Parker will not be the safest surname to have around here . So , when did your boy Cox turn on you ? Like I tried to tell you before ... any link between Cox and me is a lie . I intend to stay out of his crosshairs . And I suggest you do the same . [ Bell Dings ] - Miss Parker ? - Broots ! - Mr. Cox and a team of Sweepers are - - I heard . - I need you to find something for me . A key . - A key ? Yeah . A piece of metal with teeth on it . You know , those of us that have evolved beyond fire and wheels use it to unlock doors . - Where is it ? - Bridget 's office . Brigitte ? [ Phone Ringing ] - What ? - It was your eyes . What was ? Where Thomas felt at home . - Did he tell you that ? - Yes , he did . Do you think he ever knew what I really did ? I don 't know . But he knew who you were . And to him , that was love . He said the first time he ever experienced that feeling was when he looked into your eyes . [ Exhales ] Miss Parker ? There were so many times I wanted to tell him , to say it to him . But I - Tell him what ? It 's too late now anyway , Jarod . Never underestimate the importance of completing unfinished business . Oh , don 't you worry . Bridget will know the importance of that real soon . So , Brigitte is the one that pulled the trigger . Like you didn 't read the Rumor file you left in my home . Miss Parker , I didn 't leave you any file . Whether it 's love or revenge ... don 't let unfinished business finish you . [ Beeps ] - [ Knocking ] - [ Beeps ] - You found it ! - Yes . And what it opens , I think . You see , I realized that if Brigitte was intercepting Thomas 's calls ... she had to have them forwarded somewhere . So I went to see Manny to see if he could backtrack the calls . He owes me a favor 'cause I loaned him my karaoke machine . Follow the bouncing ball , Broots . Well , all the calls were transferred to a cabin less than 20 miles from here . Here 's the address . Be sure and tell Manny the mute that I said ... [ Mouths Words ] " Thank you . " [ Engine Off ] [ Exhales ] I knew you 'd come . I 'm havin ' the baby . [ Exhales ] I heard a little rumor about you . It 's true . Pull the trigger if you want . God knows I deserve it . You ... have no idea . Just answer one question . Why did you kill Tommy ? - Orders . - Who ordered it ? - [ Grunts ] - Tell me who ! [ Groaning ] Oh , God ! How far apart are your contractions ? Let 's just say it won 't be long before you 're a sister again . Do what you want with me . Just please let my baby live . Oh , you 've always had a knack for stating the obvious . The truth is , it doesn 't really matter anyway . - This baby will even the score for you . - The baby ? I have a disorder called placenta previa . I 'll bleed to death as the baby is born . [ Groaning , Inhaling ] [ Groaning , Screaming ] - Uh-uh . I 'll get help . - [ Dialing ] [ Groans ] There 's no signal out here . [ Groaning Continues ] Hold on ! I 'll get help ! - The land line went dead after I spoke to your father . - You spoke with Daddy ? - He said you 'd find the doctor and bring him . - Why did you run ? I knew it was just a matter of time before you found out I was Rumor . And with Mutumbo 's hitter there , I ran ... hoping to keep the focus away from your father . Despite what you think , I love him very much . [ Screaming ] God ! [ Gasps ] Oh ! Oh ! [ Gasps ] Oh ! Thank you . Thank for not making me do this alone . # [ Whistling ] - [ Gasps ] - Putting in overtime ? I 'm salary . So is your friend , Manny . The tongueless one ? The poor man drools when he speaks . Sp-Speaks ? [ Clears Throat ] About you , Mr. Broots . Me ? Now , you have an opportunity to tell me where Brigitte went . Now , if you choose not to accept that opportunity ... you could find yourself having more in common with mute Manny than just karaoke . - [ Exhales ] - Shall I sing you a torch song ? Hmm ? [ Groaning , Inhaling , Exhaling ] Stay with me , Bridget . I 'm here . I 'm sorry ... for Thomas . For all the pain I caused you . You never answered my question . I don 't know who . But it wasn 't the Triumvirate . It came from inside the Centre . They thought that you were losing your focus . Oh , God ! - Something 's happening inside ! - Where 's Daddy with the doctor ? - Stay with me now . - I 'm gonna faint . No , you 're not . No - Oh , I can see the head . You need to push . The head is blue . - I can 't . - You can . Push . The baby needs oxygen . Push ! - How bad am I ? - Uh - Uh , there 's a lot of blood . - I 'm not gonna make it . - Yes , you are , damn it ! I came here to kill you ! I 'll be the one who decides whether you live or die ! - Now push ! - [ Screaming ] - Push ! Hold on ! Help 's here ! - [ Helicopter Whirring ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ BabyCrying ] Oh ! Oh ! [ Crying Continues ] Brigitte ? Brigitte ! [ Sobbing ] Oh , God . Oh . [ Lock Rattling ] - I see I 'm too late for the Lamaze . - But not too late to die . No , no , angel . He 's on ourside . Uh , Dr. Cox is here for the baby . - Doctor ? - OB-GYN , Harvard ' 93 . [ Scoffs ] Mmm . [ Coos ] Ahh . Ooh . Aha . This seals it . The last piece . [ Chuckles ] Here you are , Nurse . Don 't forget the placenta and cord blood . Daddy , what 's going on ? Mr. Cox has been my inside man for months ... watching out while I planned my return . There 's only one reason for you being here , angel . Did she admit to everything in the Rumor file ? Damn lucky thing , that file showing ' up . - She 's gone . - Mmm . - Did you - - Kill her ? No . She died in childbirth . Aren 't you even concerned about your wife ? Till death do us part . What - She was nothing more than a vessel for the baby , for your legacy . Did you leave the Rumor file in my house ? Now , why would I do a thing like that ? Let me guess . The gun that killed Mutumbo . Found on her body . Just clears everyone of everything . She planted it in my stuff ! . It was a setup . Rumor was tryin ' to ruin both of us . When are they gonna learn they can 't whip a Parker , huh ? Make it all go away . - Daddy ? - What ? Don 't you even want to know ? Know what ? If it 's a boy or a girl . I thought that getting revenge for Tommy 's death would somehow bring me peace . But even if I had been able to , I know now it wouldn 't have . [ Jarod ] That isn 't the unfinished business that needs finishing . You said the other day that you wish you had told him . - Told him what ? - I never - I never told Tommy that I loved him . And now your heart and your mind are raging a war against each other . I would trade everything for one minute with him . Just to say those words and have him hear them . Tell him . Let your heart win the war . # [ Pop ] # [ Man Singing ] I love you , Tommy . And I love you , Parker .

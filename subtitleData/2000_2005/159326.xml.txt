 Teenage Mutant Leela 's Hurdles [ SQUAWKS ] Pazoozoo , you ungrateful gargoyle ! I put you through college , and this is how you repay me ? FARNSWORTH : Let 's get this gargoyle hunt on the road . Driving gloves , driving goggles , driving thong . There ! Maybe I should drive . You ? A woman ? I 'm trying to catch a monster , not find the quickest route to the mall . Let me just adjust the seat . [ RUMBLING ] My God , he 's gonna do it ! Everyone , seat belts to maximum buckling ! [ YELLING ] [ BRAKES SQUEALING ] [ HORNS HONKING ] FARNSWORTH : Pazoozoo ? Pazoozoo ? Hey , Grandpa ! Move your wrinkly old keister ! Shut up ! For heaven 's gate ! This ship can do 99 percent light speed . Why are we going 35 miles an hour ? Because we 're in a hurry , that 's why ! Plus , you have the high beams on ! FARNSWORTH : I can 't quite read the sign . Pazoozoo ? Pazoozoo ! Oh , it 's 2 : 30 . We can still catch the early-bird dinner special . Aren 't we looking for your gargoyle ? My what ? Hello , Mavis . Surprised to see me back again so soon ? Mavis is dead . I expect you 'll want to see my angry , crotchety , grandpa discount card ? - Sir , this card has expired . - But it 's good for a lifetime . Well , yours expired . Oh , Lord ! Teeth do not belong in your pants , professor . Well , I can 't keep them in my mouth , they 're nuclear-powered ! Ow ! It bit my finger . No ! No ! It 's tasted human blood ! [ SCREAMING ] Mm . Damn good meat . [ DOOR OPENS ] Professor , we 've talked it over , and everybody thinks you 're too old . We 've decided to do the merciful thing , and have you youth-a-sized . Dear God , no ! Relax , professor . Youth-a-sizing is a trendy new spa treatment . It 's this season 's shark-cartilage enema ! But I like being old ! I don 't have to talk to my parents , no one asks me to help move their stuff ... ... I don 't need to understand today 's " edgy " TV sitcoms . Okay , okay . We 're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence . Get him ! Ah ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh-ooh-ooh ! My thong ! [ DOOR OPENS ] Hi ! I 'm Heather , your personal youth-a-sizer . Let 's get started with a nice botulism treatment , shall we ? - Go to hell , Heather ! - Oh ... . In small doses , botulism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles ... ... instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable . Give me back my floppy face ! [ GROANING ] Careful with the giblets ! You 're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints . More pressure . Ahhh . [ BEEPING ] Since this is such a serious case of old , we 'll try our strongest treatment : A soothing , full-body bath in searing hot tar . Sir , it 's not necessary or wise to be naked . You sound just like my tennis instructor . [ GROANS ] The tar blisters the age right out of the body ... ... in what top scientists suspect is a miracle . I don 't have time for this ! I have to go buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it ... ... making people wait behind me while I complain . He still sounds sort of old , sort of real old . Step aside , lady . Like everything else in life ... ... pumping is just a primitive , degenerate form of bending . Whoa . Whoa-oa . Whoa ! Come on , Bender ! Pump harder ! Harder ! I 'm trying as hard as I can . Harder , damn you ! [ GRUNTING AND YELLING ] [ RUMBLING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ COUGHING AND GROANING ] Well , that was an utter waste of time . [ GASPING ] Professor , it worked ! You look young enough to be my father ! Poodle spit ! [ BEEPING ] Fifty-three years old ? Oh , now I 'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn . VOICE CRACKING : Cool , professor . We should go out and celebrate ! [ CHATTERING ] Dear Lord ! You 've all reverted to your childhood forms ! Hooray ! I 'm a teenage heartthrob again . While I try to restore our normal ages ... ... I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals . It wasn 't me , Mr. F. It was Amy . - Stop it , Amy ! - You stink ! You know you did it ! Quiet ! Quiet , I say ! We 're here to take my little stub of a husband home . Hermes , say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth . Goodbye , Mr. Dumbsworth ! Hey ! This is my chance to spend time with my parents too . But your parents are gross sewer mutants . Ow ! When I was an orphan ... ... I wished I could grow up with my mom and dad . And now , thanks to being hurled backwards in time- - That 's not what happened ! Shut up and go live with your parents ! LEELA : It 's gonna be totally awesome , Mom ! You and me can bake , and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face ... ... and if some kid picks on me , my dad can beat up his dad ! Can 't I just beat up the kid ? Well , okay , Leela . If you think you can put up with your father , then welcome home . We 'll try to respect your independence and freedom . No ! I want the real teen experience . Chores , curfew , the works ! Fine , sweetiekins , we 'll be the strictest parents ever . Now , let 's all have some tequila to celebrate ! Dad , I 'm underage ! Oh , right . Here 's a silly straw . Oh , my Amy is sweet little girl again . This like a mother 's dream ! Bad dream , that is . At this rate , I 'm never gonna get a grandchild ! Maybe she not grown up , but she sure grown out . She fat ! Dad , if you 're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again ... ... I 'm just gonna stay in my room ! Stay in room ? You so fat , you gonna stay all around room . I 've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth . Suddenly , I 'm going to the bathroom like clockwork , every three hours . And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks . Now I have to pay them ! I 'm tired of you yapping ! All you ever do is complain . You never try to make things better . Well , I 'm running away from this dead-end family . I know there 's a place for people like me , with new ideas . - There has to be ! - Fine . Get going . Oh , I 'm going , and you 're gonna be all , " Where 's Bender ? I miss Bender ! " We won 't know that until you leave . - Oh , I 'm leaving . - There 's the door . I 'll be good . Ah . Do you have to shed your skin on the couch ? What do we live in , a zoo ? [ DOORBELL RINGS ] I 'm getting the doorbell . For me ? Hello , sir . It 's a lovely evening you have tonight . I 'm here to pick up your daughter . Hi , Fry . I like your blazer . Thanks . These aren 't pockets , they 're just flaps . I put my money in my sock . So where are you taking my daughter tonight ? VOICE CRACKING : A movie . A movie , ma 'am . Well , whatever you 're really doing , don 't wake us if you get in after 1 2 . Dad , you 're being too lenient again . I have to be back by 1 1 . Okay , okay ! You 're the boss . No , I 'm not ! I 'd like a sewer burger , but without the rat feces . What , are you on a diet ? Leela , you look hot . Jeez , Moose . Just dump me right in front of her , why don 't you . Moose , Mandy , this is my friend Fry ... ... from the surface . Oh , so this is the famous Fry . What is he ... ... like , the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer ? - They 're onto me ! - Hey , come on ... ... let 's act like grownups here . - Wanna race ? - Yeah . Theres . The world 's drinkings water is safes for another days . Whoas ! Cripe ! LEELA : A tapeworm ! We missed the turn ! We 'll never catch them . Yes , we will . This sewer goes right under Planet Express , and it 's 9 p.m. [ TOILET FLUSHES ] FARNSWORTH : The devil take this predictable colon ! [ YELLING ] [ CHEERING ] - All right ! - Whoo-hoo ! Leela , you can stop winning now , we won ! LEELA : I can 't reach the hand brake ! That 's detention . And then a giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps ... ... but we totally dissed Moose . Yes , I 'd like to meet this Moose . But in the meantime , I have good news ! I may have solved our age problem . Yay ! It seems the youth-a-sizing tar was saturated with time-altering kronatons . A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA ... ... as well as Bender 's robo , or " RNA . " - Question . - Yes ? You stink . Yes , yes . Anyhow , I 've designed an oil-eating bacterium ... ... that should take the tar right off . Come on . Let 's go tell Leela so we can grow up together . [ MIMICS KISSING ] Thanks , professor , but I don 't want the treatment . Don 't you understand , you little nitwit ? Unless you 're treated soon , the only way to restore your true age ... ... will be to grow into it , just as God intended . He has a point , honey . What about your job and your friends ? Do you really want to abandon your old life ? My old life wasn 't as glamorous as my web page made it look . All I ever wanted was to grow up here with you . - Please ? - Well , if it 's what you really want . It is , I know it is . VOICE CRACKING : I 'll miss you , Leela . I 'll come back and visit when I 'm all grown up . - Bring beer . - No beer till you finish your tequila ! The age-restoring microbes are ready . Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber . [ CHEERING ] Yes , everyone do the same thing . Initiating controlled infection . [ WHIRRING ] [ MACHINE COUGHING AND SNEEZING ] ZOIDBERG : I 'm no doctor , but this machine guy could use a lozenge . [ FARNSWORTH GASPS ] Ah , poo ! We 're even younger ! [ BEEPING ] Damn ! The bacteria pigged out on the tar ... ... and now they 're getting freaky deaky ... ... spreading kronatons throughout our systems ! We 're getting younger by the minute ! [ GASPING ] What ? I 'm gonna revert through all my larval stages ? Word . We 'll all keep getting younger and younger ... ... until we suffer a fate worse than death : Pre-life ! Then death . [ BEEPING ] I 've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up ... ... and suffer the agony of un-birth ! Think , you disco duck , think ! What 's that squirmal under your shirt ? Oh . Get off me , you parasitic lamprey ! Oh , sure , you need all your blood ! [ ZOIDBERG MIMICS THE THREE STOOGES ] Would you all chill ? I can 't think with you kids cramping my style ! I need a babysitter . LEELA : Okay , quiet time . [ CHEERING ] I know , everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongues , and I 'll read you a story . Yeah , a story ! I can 't see from down here , I can 't ! There . Today 's story is from Muteen Magazine . Who would you rather hear about , Four-legged Chachi or Tentacle Chachi ? I want to hear a space story ! It 's kind of a baby book , but okay . Let 's see . " Snow White Dwarf and the Seven Red Dwarfs . " " Charlotte 's Tholian Web . " " The Fountain of Aging . " [ GASPS ] The Fountain of Aging ? Hm . It is just a legend . Still , they called the Tooth Fairy a legend , and now he 's head of the fbi ! What 's up ? Kids ready ? Yay ! Professie 's back ! Ew . You smell like smoking . And drinking ! I had a few beers , but I 'm cool to drive . I wish I could come with you to say goodbye ... ... before you all turn back into grownups ... ... but I 'm grounded for knocking the school over . Who cares , Leela ? It was just a public school . Now , go with your friends , please . No ! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room ! Until she sneaks out . BENDER : When I grow up , I wanna be a steam shovel ! According to this , the fountain is located in the darkest ... ... most ancient region of space , just past Teddy Bear Junction . Teddy Bear Junction , the worst scum-hole in the galaxy . This solar system is , like , way old ! Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet ! FARNSWORTH : News flash : Everything 's getting older the closer we get to that ancient , burnt-out sun . Dude , the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself ! Shut up ! I was gonna say that . [ BABIES CRYING ] We 've got to hurry . The kids have only one change of pants . We gotta be real , real careful to stay in just long enough ... ... to make us our right ages again . [ SPLASHING ] ZOIDBERG : Whee ! Zoidberg , get out of there ! The current ! It 's too much already ! Help ! Jeepers ! - Zoidberg is dead ! ZOIDBERG : Zoidberg 's brother is dead . Funny story . I just reverted to the age when my siblings budded from me ... ... and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain . He always had to be the center of attention ! Let him go . Oh , no ! Quick ! Get them into the fountain ! Thanks for the help , Leela . Once we 're growed up , you can go back to your family . We 'll never bother you again . Well , you could bother me a little . It 's working ! Hooray ! I can 't hold on ! [ SCREAMING ] I 'm coming in after you ! No , Leela ! You can 't give up your childhood . You 'll never have another chance at it ! [ YELLING ] [ COUGHING AND GROANING ] We did it ! We 're the right ages again ! I think I might be a couple years younger ! Oh , me too ! [ GROANING ] FARNSWORTH : Help ! I 'm still in mid-peril , you clods ! He 's too far out ! We can 't reach him ! With my last breath , I curse Zoidberg ! [ SQUAWKING ] Pazoozoo ! You came back to me . Are you back to your original age , professor ? [ BEEPING ] Even older ! Huzzah ! [ CRACKING ] I 'm sorry you had to give up being a kid , Leela . Well , I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes . But I worked hard to be the person I am . - The fabulous person . - With friends like you guys . Fabulous friends . And I 'm really happy I have that life back . And you , my faithful fiend , how can I ever repay you ? And that , little one , is how Papa gained his freedom . Now , bonne nuit .

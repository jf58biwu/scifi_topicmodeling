 Outstanding . Believe it or not , I 'm actually getting better at controlling this thing . How did you say you figured this out ? Well , much trial and ... error , actually . Yeah , it 's impressive . Well , I haven 't had much else to do . Takes time to learn to fly . I know you 've been ... practicing on the ground , but ... Oh , whoa , hang on ! - How many times ? ! - One . Once . Uno . One time . You had to have touched something ! - D 'Argo , I didn 't touch ... anything . - How many times did I ask you ? I said , " Do not go inside the ship ! " ! I was using it . - Quit actin ' like Yosemite Sam ! - I asked you just to stop ! Whoa ! Hey ! Yo , yo , yo , easy man ! Remember what the doctors say about hyper-rage ... John , I have nothing . Nothing ! I have no wife , no son , no home ... nothing ! - I have been forced to manufacture distractions in order to live ! - D 'Argo ... D 'Argo , your ship ... That ship is all I have ! You sabotaged my frelling ship ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship- - this living ship ... of escaped prisoners ... my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay , protect my home , not show them you exist . But then you 'll never know the wonders I 've seen . Pilot ? Pilot ? I 'm sorry , Jool . But , as you can understand , I am ... Yeah , yeah . He 's not good . There 's some blood in his skull and some swelling , and he 's barely breathing . Did the power cell in Zhaan 's diagnostic scanner activate ? Anything with it 's own power source still works . Pilot , John 's fever 's way up . I can 't control the temperature there Nor much else . The energy pulse seared all Moya 's active power conduits . We 're fortunate comms weren 't in use at the time . Is that krastik ship still frelling with us ? Yes , D 'Argo feels Crichton 's interference must have triggered a security self-destruct sequence . Can he stop it ? When we last spoke , D 'Argo was rather agitated . - Which part of I don 't know has you baffled ? ! - Can 't flush the ship out . - The hangar doors won 't open ! - Can 't escape in a transport pod . - The hangar doors won 't open - Fix the hangar doors ! Pilot has no control ! You really frelled us this time . Me ? ! It wasn 't me . It was Crichton ! - Oh , so you tried to kill him ? - I didn 't try and kill him , he slipped ! You 're pathetic ... you really are ... we 're all gonna die because ... KA D 'ARGO ... Your Qualta Blade ! That was mature . So , when 's this ship gonna blow ? Unknown . Moya and I have no active senses in the transport hangar ... Yeah , yeah , we get the idea . Wh-what do we do ? Re-activate the DRDs . They 're the only ones who can rewire Moya . Rewire ? Your ship ... crippled every internal conduit and power application running at the time . Then I 'll cripple it . - Hey , Princess ... - We 're gonna die , aren 't we ? Eventually . You got the mivonks to push the date back ? Help D 'Argo in the transport hangar when he 's sick of you ... find me . Do you know what 's happening ? I 'm dying . Let 's see what 's left in the fuel tank . Go away and let me do what I gotta do . - Oh , what ... find a reason to live ? - I got plenty of reasons . Then , give me the Letterman List . Earth , Dad , pizza , sex ... cold beer , fast cars , sex , Aeryn ... love ... Well ... - we 're both dead . - Screw you . None of that crap will get the job done , John . You die ... you drag me with you . You want some advice ? - Revenge . - Revenge ? Yes . Love is transient , vaporous ... and guess who Aeryn loves right now ? He wins ... you lose . - Thank you for coming-go away . - Revenge is the strongest emotion , John . - Go away . - D 'Argo put you here ! - Live to even the score ! - Goodbye , Scorpy ! Bye-bye ! Your mind is no longer strong enough to control my comings and goings . Is that a challenge ? How did you ... ? Looney Tunes ! Wasted energy , John . Now , focus ! Revenge is deep within your psyche . A core vestige from your earliest evolution . Unleash it now ! No . This After School Special ... dissipates our chances of survival , John ! Do you really want revenge ? Oh , Yes ! Okay Revenge ... But only for you . Are you sure that noise means we 're going to explode ? What if it 's just a ... Soft-core overload . It 's ... like it wants us to shut it down but , I don 't know how . But you did it before . Whatever Crichton did ... he disabled the sequence of commands I was building up . I mean , what if it wasn 't Crichton ? What if something 's just happened ? I 've been off the ground on this thing four times . No problems . He did it . - What 's up dude ? How you doin ' ? - You 're dying . Yeah , yeah . D 'Argo tried to kill me . Perhaps an overstatement . Well , same net result . Is he an enemy you wish to harm ? Oh , man . I don 't even know why we 're fightin ' . Then rise above his behavior . Moya and I find it advantageous to avoid confrontation by egressing . Run away ? Aggression feeds on opportunity . Remove yourself as a target and the pursuer will eventually tire . You 're very wise . I don 't get out much ... so , I read . Well , thanks for the advice . You could try it now ... if you like . Aw , give me a break . Come on D 'Argo , we 're friends . No more , human . You can run as much as you like . But , I 'm gonna catch 'ya . Yike ! Come on man ! Chill ' fore somebody gets hurt ! Any guesses who , runt ? Better look out ! Right ! Like I 'm gonna fall for that ! God , I love science fiction ! This is Farscape One . I am free and flying . Wormole ! Yo , Harvey ! Front and center , dude ! Pilot was right , you were wrong . Pilot was right , you were wrong . If I keep running , nothing can hu--ahh ! Nothing can hurt you ? Is that what you 're trying to say ? You can only run for so long , John . Even in the childlike safety of your cartoon . My way ... will sustain you ! Mother 's milk . Brutal ... Real . revenge Take revenge , John ! Chiana 's efforts with the DRDs have restored minimal functioning . We now have a presence in the maintenance bay , and ... our analysis of that ship 's energy signature indicates it will explode in just under an arn . Under an arn ? An estimate only . Can you do something ? We will not be able to expel that ship . So , we 're all gonna die ? Moya and myself , certainly . However ... I may have a way to save you . Take food , liquids and a long-range frequency modulator to Tier 16 's treblin side pressure hatchway . You should be able to survive a few solar days prior to hypothermia ... if I jettison it . Oh , Pilot ! Go . We can 't just leave you . Go ! Gotcha Princess . Treblin side hatch , Tier 16 . I 'm gonna try something , then I 'll meet you in the cold storage . - We 're not leaving without Crichton . - But Pilot said ... An arn ! Load the supplies . Do ... what I tell you . Children . Nothing works . I 've failed . - Move D 'Argo . Let mommy shoot it . - No , no , no , no. no . It won 't let you . Well , let 's get outta here . I don 't like to lose . Well , then why 'd you let go of me ? What 'd you say ? Just something Luxan . My Grandfather used to say it all the time . Hey ! What 're you doing ? I 'm not quite sure , but I think that is a Luxan symbol for " spoken word " . You can read that ? A little bit . I 'm not really up on my Ancient Luxan . What ! . What 's it saying ? - What ? ! - I don 't know ! - Well , is it Luxan ? - Yes . Well then , how could you not know ? I am not Ancient Luxan . I do not speak Ancient Luxan , and I do not read Ancient Luxan , because I am not Ancient Luxan ! And not likely to become one either . Ka D 'Argo ! - Moya 's dead-language library is incomplete ! - What about ancient war declarations ? - My access to it at this time even more so ! - ... even some historical transcriptions - ... of speeches . You can even ... - At best I can find words ... - try some anti-luxan propaganda ! - ... fragments of words . Pilot , that ship is trying to kill us . I need to know why it speaks Luxan . - The DRDs can prepare a supplemental ... translator microbe ... - Good ! Good ! Do it ! - Just do it ! - ... injection with any data I un ... How can he not learn his ancient tongue ? What kind of civilization doesn 't pass on it 's culture ? They 're warriors . Most of them didn 't learn to read or write until 300 cycles ago . That 's ridiculous . It 's savage . I 'll wager there are no artists or chefs there either . What is your problem ? I did it . You usually do . What ? I was in his ship . What ? I ... I didn 't mean to . I ... You ... need to die horribly . Oh , like you never screw up ! You gonna compare this to anything I do ? - Don 't you think I feel bad ? And here I confide in you ! - Do not-do not ... - ... . frelled ! - And what do you do ? You turn on me ! Just , shut up ! - All right . Okay . - All right , You go . All right . I 've given it a lot of thought ... - I think the best thing to do right now is just to calm down ... and figure this out . - ... maybe it was , maybe it was something Crichton did , and while things are still bad there 's no reason D 'Argo should be mad at me , is there ? ... I don 't know how I can make my point when you will not ... Would you just ... ... stop talking ! Now it 's my turn . We are going to do the right thing ... - I think I know what to do ... - ... and my personal hatred for you will be satisfied ... Girls ! What ... are you doing ? Huh ? ! Having a conversation . " Having a conversation " . Obviously very interesting . Listen . This is my only chance with these translator microbes . If it doesn 't work , be here ... ready ! Okay ? ! Now , you listen to me . D 'Argo has a lot on his mind at the moment . If we survive , you tell him anything you like . - I just need too ... - No ! Do not ... Do not tell him . - Isn 't she great ? - Yeah . I 'm thrilled with our relationship . Well . D 'Argo and I aren 't gettin ' along too good these days either . Yeah . He put you in a coma . I gotta figure out what to do about that . How hard 's that ? You 're gonna die . Well , Scorpy thinks I should get revenge . Pilot wanted me to run , but that didn 't work . You got any ideas ? You once said to me that our species might be related . If ... that 's true , you have to have a measure of intelligence about you , which means you can reason . Be honest . Talk to him . Work out the problem . Conflict 's for barbarians . D 'Argo ? I think it may have been me . I was in here earlier . I didn 't touch anything , I was just here . I found this in the control ! Your hair ! Are you going to kill me ? I 've already hurt Crichton today . That 's enough . I didn 't mean to cause any of ... Well , what did you mean ? ! I mean , what were you doing in here ? ! I know ... that I can be ... difficult . That no one wants to spend time with me . You 're someone ... who ... I like , and I know ... that since the problems with your son and Chiana ... that you 've preferred to be alone ... in here . I just thought ... if this is so important to you ... that maybe ... maybe if I learned a little about it ... we might have something to talk about . Thanks for making the effort . D 'Argo , we 're friends , right ? And ... friends don 't let friends drive drunk ... Wow . You look great . Is this the best you could do ? I ... I miss you . Obviously . Where are my clothes ? On ... Talyn . You and that ... other guy ... the other me ... you 're not , uh ... Mm , don 't do it to yourself , John . Right . Oh , no , no , no . Before you go , you fix this ! I get it . " I 'm not bad . " " I 'm just drawn that way . " Oh , please ! At least use a little imagination ! " Happy Birthday , Mister Astronaut ... " " Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou , Romeo ? " Honey , that 's the wrong Shakespeare . " There 's no place like home . " Hey , Johnny ? Like a virgin ? I 'd ... like ... rescue you ! Can you do that Sharon Stone thing ? Basic Instinct . Johnny , just say ... There 's a good boy . Thank you . Now ... What are you gonna do about D 'Argo ? I dunno . I 'm ... supposed to talk to him . Not really sure what to say . Any advice ... help ? D 'Argo D 'Argo , could you just leave ... young Johnny alone , please ? Run , Forrest ! Run ! Come on , D. Let , Let 's talk this out . Never . Ladies , comin ' through . Captain ... we hit something with the front of the ship ! D 'Argo We 're friends , big man ! How ' bout a little rock , paper , scissors , to work through your ... anger ? I ... don 't think so , John . You 'd really shoot me ? We could get counseling , I know a guy . Dr. Chuck Jones wrote Dr. Chuck Jones wrote the book on these situations . Yo , babe , Jool , you were right ... You think so ? You think you can reason with me ? Clear ! Clear ! You feel the life ... ebbing from both of us , John ? The creep of cadaverous cold ? Achilles ... I believe , your strength ... has a weakness . Your stubborness has served you well in the past ... but now it is killing you , John . These cartoons are a crutch . Attempting to shield yourself instead of doing what is called for ... Revenge . D 'Argo ... the DRD should be there any microt . All I could do was piece together fragments of language . An incomplete vocabularly at best . That 's all anyone can ask , Pilot . Let 's give it a shot . The DRD will inject you . What 's it say ? D 'Argo , you have to tell me .. " Active self-destruct code can be voided ... with one of three ... ah , ss . pre , pre-determined , ah , artifacts , singular to Luxan heritage . Ancient Freedom Text ... " That 's very rare . " An Orican 's Prayer Amulet . " This is ... hopeless What ! What is it wants What ! ... Qualta Blade . With so little time left , I suggest you all start to prepare ... begin searching , immediately ! - Now , I threw it over in this direction here . - Why would you do that ? ! Short version ? Because of you . Now ... I heard it falling , so it could be on one of those tiers down there , or , uh ... it could have fallen all the way down the neural cluster . So , we split up and search . A caution . The DRDs use this empty cavern ... to deposit construction and repair refuse . It 's a reasonable risk , start searching ! Hey , Pip . You got a sec ? Sure . You up on everything that 's goin ' on ? Yeah . You 're dying . Scorpius wants you to get revenge . Pilot says , run like a ... a scalded kepnetz . And Jool would talk D 'Argo 's ear off ... till he committed suicide . So , uh ... what do you think ? Well , revenge is sweet ... It 's always worth the effort ... Why do I get the cellar , and you guys get the catwalk ? - This place smells horrible . - Guaranteed by your arrival . Sugnil . Chiana ... What do you want , D 'Argo ? What ? I should bottle it up and become a Luxan ? Well , showing a little bit of self restraint wouldn 't hurt . Any luck ? Just crap ... ... and dren . - Hey , Princess , watch out . - Watch out for what ? Chunks of metal . Don 't get hit . There 's no metal down here , there 's just muck . - Do you have muck ? - Oh , yeah ... up to my crotch in it . - Chiana ! Jool ! Watch out ! - For what ? ! You little slut ! No , no . It wasn 't Chiana . It was me . Then how did she know ? I dunno . Just made sense . No revenge ... ... no talking ... no running ! Come on , baby , you 're the Sultana of Survival . What 's left ? Be smarter . They always make it more complicated than what they need to . Use it against ' em . Screw ' em at their own game . That 's good . Pilot ? Yes , Joolushko ? Are there ... other things ... living in Moya ... with us ? A panoply of harmless parasites . Many serving symbiotic functions . Perhaps you 're hearing the Hodian Trill-Bat swarms . Do these ... Hodian Bat-things ... leave droppings ? Extensively . Their effluvium ... spreads along Moya 's inner hull , and helps seal microscopic cracks . Bat dren . You 're walking through it . Missed me , hah ! Yo , D 'Argo . Look down . Don 't you get it , D 'Argo ? Chiana was right . I can always outsmart you . You gotta admit it , my wormhole looks a lot better than yours . You ... did not ... paint .. a wormhole ! You ... forgot to make yours swirly . Well , this little spaceman 's goin ' home ! Lock up the wimmen and hide the fried-chicken ! I think I broke my leg . Did you think you could make up all the rules ? Keep hiding behind a cartoon forever ? Dearly beloved , we are gathered here today to pay our final respects and to say farewell ... to our dear friend , Commander John Crichton . A schmuck . Muleheaded , reckless , and ... probably braindead before I met him . Alas ... his death ... Is mine also . Even I dont ' know if it 's too late . We could already be gone . I love Aeryn . That should be enough . Soft emotion ... won 't get the job done ! Revenge ? Crichton to D 'Argo . Man to Beast . Destroy the bastard , John ! If only in your own mind . Marty Goldstein ... stole my bike when I was seven . I went over to his house , and I gave him a bloody nose . Powerful emotion ... revenge . Could 'a just taken the bike back . Yes . But , can you just take your life back ? I don 't ... wanna be like other people . I don 't wanna be like you . I don 't wanna stoop that low . Kirk wouldn 't stoop that low . That was a television show , John . And he made Priceline commercials . But , if you insist . Then look to Kirk the way he really was ... savage , when he had to be ! He 's a fiction , Harv . I know the difference . I 'm real , I have to live with what I do . You can no more deny your biologic heritage ... than change your grandparents birthplace . These ... primitive animal urges you think you must resist ... they 're not relics from an uncivilized time ! They are in you for a reason ! Because you need them . No cartoons , John . You can take him ! Eh ... what 's up , D 'Argo ? I 'll tell you what 's up ... I 'm gonna kill you ! I don 't think so . Frell . Chiana Still nothing . Pilot ? I would suggest again that you head immediately to the escape hatchway . At least ... save yourselves ! Good idea , and about time ! Princess ? I have the Qualta Blade ! I have the Qualta Blade ! I have the Qualta Blade ! I have the Qualta Blade ! This is kinda like the sound you hear before you die . Or after . Okay , you frellnik , it 's your turn to die . On with the show , this is it ! No cartoons , no crutches ... revenge ! I 'd like the thank the Academy ... for this beautiful Oscah ! Oh , shut up , John . It 's not presentation night . You ought to be thanking me . - For what ? - For saving your life . Sorry , Harv , no joy . I gave it a shot , you could 'a been right ... . You were wrong . I ... don 't understand . Course you don 't ... understand . You live in the country , but you do not speak the language . Just ... don 't , don 't touch anything in here , y-y-you 're clueless . No , John ... revenge ! For you ... it 's a way of life . For me it 's not the answer . Then we 're dead . Don 't ever distract me from what I really feel . Harv ... I ... I love ... Aeryn . I appreciate your help , though . That 's all folks . Identify yourself . I am Ka D 'Argo ... son of Laytun ... grandson of Reksa ... and I am the great-grandson of Ka D 'Argo Treytal . Power systems at your command , Ka D 'Argo . Telemetry functions at your command . Deception Shroud at your command . Sonic Accelerator at your command . Particularization Field at your command . Weapons Cascade at your command . Communications Array at your command . Eyes ... clear . You did it . I did it . I did it . Hey , guys ? The lights are all out maybe we should call someone ? This stuff ... will not come off ! Well , lucky for you it doesn 't smell . It smells terrible . Right . I mean , lucky for me ... we don 't share quarters . You know , I think you should just show a little more respect . Without my sacrifice , you wouldn 't be ... We would have all ... perished . Moya and I thank you ... Jool . You 're welcome , Pilot . Oh , if I were you , I 'd clean out that lower level if you ever expect me to go down there again . Yes ... of course . Well , you wouldn 't have to go down there again if you 'd stop frellin ' around with other people 's stuff . Um , excuse me ... D 'Argo and I have already sorted all that . Yeah . I 'm gonna take the first ride on his ship when he figures it all out . Kids . Crichton , I know you 're out there . If you won 't talk to me ... can you at least just listen ? Somehow saying I 'm sorry seems so inadequate . Ah , we 'll get through it . I 've so much rage inside . So many things . Sometimes I ... I just need to control it better . Well , now would be a good time to learn . You got a baby ship to feed . It 's a curse , John . A warrior heritage ... my instincts . You just gotta know when to control ' em , bro . We have a code ... aggression against an ally entitles retribution . D 'Argo ... look at me . There is nothing ... that would ever make me take revenge on you . Thank you . When you were dead ... did you know you were dead ? I mean , no ... what went through your mind ? What did you see ? Buddy ... that would be impossible for me to explain to you .

 It 's freezing out there . You weren 't gone long . - Did you do what I asked ? - Yes . It 's important , Gary . - Promise me you did it . - You 're sick , Dad . You should be in a hospital , not stuck out here in the middle of nowhere . - You don 't owe this guy Stites anything . - lt 's not about owing . I freeze my butt off checking and rechecking the locks every night . - For what ? - You don 't need to know . Yeah , that 's for sure . I 'm gonna fix some dinner . Oh , Lord . He didn 't . Oh , God . Dad ? Agent Scully . Can I take your coat ? I 'm not staying , Agent Doggett . My doctor told me to take my maternity leave . In fact , she insisted on it . That 's not bad , Agent Scully . You could use some time for yourself . What is it ? It 's a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight . I 'd like to give this to you , Agent Doggett . Thanks . - Because ? - Agent Mulder gave it to me a few years back . It symbolizes teamwork ... partnership . It means no one gets there alone . And after this past year and ... everything that we 've been through , I just ... I wouldn 't be here without you . Agent Scully . This pregnancy leave . It 's just a leave , right ? I mean ... you are coming back eventually ? You 're not gone five minutes , Scully , and already I feel like a stranger in my own off ... I 'm sorry ? - Can I help you ? - l 'm here to help you , actually . I 'm Leyla Harrison . I 've been looking forward to meeting you . I 've got a case here , an X-File , I think . At least the local PD can 't explain it . A murder last night in upstate New York . I booked us on a flight to Buffalo Niagara . Here 's the crime report . I 'm sorry , Ms Harrison . Who are you ? Oh , gosh . They didn 't tell you ? This is so embarrassing . I 'm your new partner . I asked that the body be sent to DC . It was found in the woods about 50 yards beyond the house . Maybe we should begin there . Let 's begin inside the house . OK , then . The deceased is Arlen Sacks , aged 72 . Caretaker for the estate on which this house is situated . No physical trauma , but local PD suspect homicide due to the dumping of the body . Mr Sacks was confined to a wheelchair the last few months , cared for since then by his son , Gary , who 's their chief suspect . Why ? Because he 's missing , too . If he killed this man without leaving a mark , that would suggest premeditation . But that doesn 't fit with dumping the body in the woods or fleeing , both of which indicate panic , haste . That is great . What was that last part again , about the premeditation ? What is that ? Slime ? There 's a small streak of it on the floor over there , too . So it 's not someone. lt 's something ? God . This really is an X-File , isn 't it ? Congratulations . I gave the slime to the Buffalo PD. I told them we wanted to see the results right away . How much field experience you have ? Actually , this is my first time in the field . Let me guess . Deputy Director Kersh handed you this job , filling in for Agent Scully . Yes , he did . I don 't know how to tell you this , Agent Harrison , but you 're being used . Kersh is no friend to the X-Files . I don 't think you understand something . I begged for this assignment . You begged for it ? I was in Accounting. I processed Agents Mulder and Scully 's travel expenses . Then you are qualified . Maybe I 'm not , but I know the X-Files , Agent Doggett , inside and out . Other people don 't want to admit these questions exist , but you face them daily . I am just so excited to be a part of this . Aren 't you ? Mr Sack 's body was found here , but they found no footprints leading to it . Oh , my God . There 's more of it . - Looks like it . - You know what that could be ? Bile . - Bile ? - From a liver-eating mutant . Mulder and Scully chased one into an escalator once. lt died , but ... This is not a liver-eating mutant , Agent Harrison . It could be an alien who shed its skin . According to Mulder 's reports , they leave behind a mucus-like residue when they ... You don 't think it 's that either . I 'll take a sample of this . Have it sent to the lab for comparison . That 's good thinking , Agent Harrison . - Ready to roll ? - Yeah. I 'll just get my keys . Don 't forget this . Relax the back . Breathe in , breathe out . - How do you know all these things , Mulder ? - l 'm unemployed . Got time on my hands . Oprah. I watch a lot of Oprah . Thank you for doing this with me . What 's the matter ? I don 't know. I ... Maybe it 's hormones or ... This is just ... I 'm just feeling so strange about all of this . This ... having-a-baby this ? No . Leaving work , I guess. I mean , I ... I walked out of that office today feeling like a deserter . You 've paid your dues there , Scully . More than paid them . You 're concerned about Agent Doggett ? You know , the entire time I was down there I had someone to watch my back . I 'm betting that Agent Doggett can take care of himself . He 's a big boy . You gotta worry about the little boy . Or little girl . Boy ? Or girl ? - Agent Harrison , what are you doing here ? - l followed the tr ... lt 's here . It ? What " it " ? You 're armed , right ? What do you want me to do ? I want you to go outside and I want you to stand by the front door . Whatever it is , I 'm gonna try and flush it out . Agent Harrison . Take the safety off . Harrison . Agent Harrison ! - Skinner . - ls it true ? - Agent Scully . - Someone told me Doggett 's gone missing . - lt was a murder case . He didn 't report back . - Why wasn 't I told ? - Don 't worry ... - l 'm heading into the Bureau now . - No , you 're not . - Are you ordering me not to look for him ? I 've got every available law-enforcement officer out here . You 're on maternity leave now . Just trust that we 're doing everything we know to do . I know that you are , but what if it 's not enough ? - l 'll just take this to the lab . - Thank you . Seems like old times - you in scrubs , slicing and dicing . - What are you doing here , Mulder ? - l wandered away from my tour . A better question is , what are you doing here ? I found something that may prove helpful in locating Agent Doggett . This is Arlen Sacks , the murder victim Doggett was investigating . This old man was not murdered . He died of heart failure , evidently after he was blinded by a chemical substance of some kind . The orbits have residual traces of a slimy substance known as hydrolytic enzymes . Venom . Produced by reptiles . - How 'd you know ? - Before Doggett and Harrison went missing , they sent in samples to be analyzed - hydrolytic enzymes . Skinner told me . I also found some bacteria in the venom , which I 'm going to do a culture on . Let somebody else do it . There are other concerns right now . I know , but this is an X-File , Mulder , and you are out of the Bureau . And now if I go home , where is Skinner gonna find someone qualified to look into this ? I know where he could find somebody . - Agent Doggett ? - l 'm right here . - Are you all right ? - lt sprayed my eyes with something . - My vision 's all blurry . - Makes two of us . Three , actually . I think it 's Gary Sacks , the son of the murder victim . - How 'd you get down here ? - l think it dragged me down. I 'm not sure . So what do we do now ? I don 't know . Mulder and Scully investigated a case once in Florida . It involved subterranean men who took people underground . I told you this is not a man . I fell through some kind of trap . I 'm guessing somebody put that there to provide live meals for this thing . - You 're not saying that includes us ? - l don 't intend to wait around and find out . Bootleggers built these tunnels in Prohibition . There 's got to be one that leads back to the house . Something up there , I think . Some kind of light . I can 't tell how high up that is . - Mulder , you 're not supposed to be out here . - l 'm not out here . What happened to the search ? Police in West Seneca found Doggett 's car at a convenience store a half-hour from here . - How 'd it get there ? - l don 't know . But we 're redirecting our search . - Where you going ? - For a walk in the woods . We 've already had 40 people looking . What the hell ? I 'm out of ajob already , right ? Thought all you people left . You are ? Herman Stites. I own this property . You 're just the man I wanted to speak to , Mr Stites . Have you seen anything unusual around here ? - Unusual ? How ? - Dangerous animals ? Reptiles ? I thought the police were looking for a man - Arlen 's son , Gary . That is what they 're looking for . - Agent Doggett ? - l 'm all right . I don 't think Gary Sacks committed murder . I think he may be a victim himself . I didn 't catch your name , Agent . Kersh . Alvin Kersh . - l 'm a scientist , Mr Kersh . - What kind of scientist ? A biologist , so I know something about animals . They don 't generally carry men off into the woods like poor Mr Sacks . I don 't think this was an animal . I think it was a man using some kind of reptile venom to blind them first . - That would be quite a trick . - You 'd have to know what you were doing . You 'd have to be , say , a scientist . Are you accusing me of something , Mr Kersh ? No . I 'm just thinking out loud , Mr Stites . I need a hand . Agent Doggett , what happened ? I lost my grip , with a little help from the man upstairs . I 'm a federal agent ! I don 't understand . Why would he want to keep us down here ? You wanted to face the unknown . Well , you 're facing it now . But who is he ? Some kind of scientist , I think . I saw some books and papers on biology in his library . It could be a kind of symbiotic relationship between this man and this creature . - Mulder and Scully ... - Mulder and Scully aren 't here . We are . And wild speculation isn 't gonna help us find the way out . You think I 'm pretty foolish , don 't you ? I appreciate your enthusiasm , but you want to take leaps that aren 't supported by the facts . What I want you to do is stay with that guy right there , while I look for another way out . If this thing comes near you , I want you to shoot . Agent Doggett . He 's gone . What do you mean he 's gone ? I don 't know . It must have taken him . - Mulder . - Mulder , what are you doing ? Spitting sunflower shells on Herman Stites 's driveway . You ? I just got off the phone with Skinner , who is furious . Stites called him saying you 're impersonating Kersh and making baseless accusations . What 's he mad about ? Me impersonating Kersh or me harassing Stites ? The victim had reptile venom in his eyes . Are you now saying it was a man who did this ? What are you saying it is , Scully ? I know this may be hard to believe , coming from me , but a reptile attack is the only explanation consistent with the scientific evidence . I don 't think it 's a monster we 're dealing with . I think it is a man . - Why do you say that ? - You re-gifted . - l 'm sorry ? - My Apollo medallion . - You found it ? - Yeah . On the grass on Stites 's estate . Doggett must be around here somewhere . - Agent Scully ? - l gotta go . What am I looking at ? We cultured the bacteria from the hydrolytic enzymes sprayed into the old man 's eyes . - Looks like they 're breaking down the tissue . - They are . The venom blinds its victim , then the bacteria excretes protease and collagenase throughout the victim 's body . - Digestive enzymes . - Everything is liquefied for easy digestion , while the victim 's skin is made hard , forming a shell from which the reptile can drink . So the reptile sprays its victim and then all it has to do is wait . There are precedents for this sort of thing in nature . Yeah , but there are no species that can do all of this . At least not yet . What do you mean ? Talk about the blind leading the blind . I owe you an apology , Agent Doggett . You 're doing fine , Agent Harrison . Hang tough . You were right. I 'm not qualified . We 're going to find a way out of here , Agent Harrison . I don 't think I am . Why ? What is it ? Whatever happened to Sacks , I think it 's happening to me . I 'm completely blind now . Oh , God . Agent Doggett ! I think it 's Gary Sacks . Mulder . - You were right about Herman Stites , Mulder . - What 'd you find ? Stites is a crypto-biologist specializing in reptile genetics . Listen to this. lt says here he published a monograph last year claiming to be " on the verge of creating a new species of reptile . " - You don 't think he succeeded , do you ? - l don 't know . He never issued a follow-up . But , Mulder , the bacteria inside this venom ... If Stites is genetically altering reptile breeds , it may explain the peculiar properties . Mulder , are you listening to me ? Mulder ? Mulder ? I think Mr Stites might have a lot more than that to explain . Mulder ? Mulder ! Mr Stites ! Mr Stites , open up ! Mr Stites , open the door ! Mr Stites ! Mr Stites ! Mr Stites ! What do you want ? Where is it , Mr Stites ? This thing you 're protecting , this creature of yours ? I don 't think you meant for it to , but it attacked the caretaker and his son , and then it attacked my colleagues . Now , I can have 50 men in here to comb this place within the hour . Where are they , Mr Stites ? It 's all right. lt 's just me . Doesn 't make any damn sense . - There 's no exit , except that door . - Maybe it does . - Agent Doggett ? - Right here ! It 's all right , Agent Doggett . We 're gonna get you out of here . - Who 's that with you ? - The man that lives here . He 's been protecting this thing . He 's kept us here . - Agent Doggett , I know ... - lt 's him . He 's not protecting it . He is it . Agent Mulder ? Agent Doggett , I don 't have a weapon . I 'm coming to get yours . No , I 'm not . Mulder , I can 't see . - Mulder , where is it ? - Right above you . It 's coming this way . - Where , Mulder ? I can 't see . - Aim down . - Aim at the sound of my voice . - No , I 'll shoot you ! I can 't see ! - Aim at the sound of my voice ! - Where is it ? - Aim at me ! Fire when I tell you to fire ! - No ! Fire ! Agent Mulder ? Agent Mulder ? I 'm right here . I 'm right here , Agent Doggett . Agent Doggett ? - ls this it ? - No . We just came by to visit Agent Harrison . How is she ? She 's on the same antivenin treatment I got . Her eyesight 's pretty much back . She 's gonna be fine , physically . - Skinner said she won 't return to the X-Files . - That was her choice . It 's just gonna be me for a while . I want to return something to you that I think you deserve to keep . I appreciate the gesture , but , if it 's all the same to you , there 's someone else who should have it . No way . This means ... I can 't tell you what this means to me . Can I ask you something ? Sure . When you went to Antarctica to save Agent Scully from being taken by that spaceship and you ran out of gas in your snowcat , how did you get back ? First of all it was never actually proven that it was a spaceship . It wasn 't ? No , what happened was that we fell off of something that rose out of the ice . - What do you think that was ? - l don 't know , but we didn 't see a spaceship . - l can 't believe you 're saying that . - lt could have been a spaceship . - Of course it was . - We don 't know it was . You have no picture . - You saw it . - No , I was unconscious . - You still are ! - When I woke up there was no ship . Mulder , no . Then you were frozen , and I hugged you until you were not frozen anymore . Visiontext Subtitles : Natasha Cohn US english

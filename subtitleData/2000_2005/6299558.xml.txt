 I have an urgent communication to deliver to Dr. Nordlinger . I can deliver the communication . I was asked to confirm and verify he received the communiqué and report back ... That 's not proper procedure . ... report back Dr. Nordlinger 's acknowledgment of the communiqué . What 's going on here ? There 's some confusion as to the proper procedure , Dr. Nordlinger . I have a communication for you . Communication acknowledged and confirmed , Captain . We 're returning to base . - Officer Bamford . - Captain . Prepare to transmit to operations commander . Transmit what , sir ? Sir ... what is the communication ? We 're coming in . Previously , on The X Files ... Deceased 's name is Carl Wormus , deputy administrator for the EPA . Somebody put his obituary under our noses . Have you found any incriminating evidence on me yet ? And I 'd heard you and John Doggett were tight . Whatever you may think about him , Brad , he 's not a fool . - Who is she ? - I 've never seen her before this morning . Now I 've seen her twice . Knowle Rohrer told me your pregnancy was a result of a government cloning experiment to try and create - a super soldier . - My baby is fine . I know what you 're afraid of . That there 's something wrong with your baby . There 's tons of files on chloramine here . Grab the files and go . Agent Doggett ? Doggett ? I 'm sorry I 'm late . Have a seat , Agent Reyes . Agent Reyes , I thought we might have a little chat . Mr. Skinner here has been trying to help me put together the pieces of your X Files investigation . Can we cut the crap , Brad ? I don 't know . Can we ? There 's a lot of crap to cut through . Agent Reyes ... you probably want to zip it and try to cooperate . Like it or not , I 'm now charged with the task of reining you in . - Reining us in ? - Uh-huh . For what ? Unauthorized autopsies ; breaking and entering into a state water facility ; willful misuse of your positions . I really don 't want to go into any of this without my partner here . Your partner . Your so-called partner who 's running this circus , is right now nowhere to be found . What are you doing , Brad ? Giving you and Mr. Skinner the opportunity to put a nice spin on this mess that Doggett 's making . Agent Reyes , if you 're not going to zip it , at least recognize that he 's the only one who can help you . We were given a tip we believe leads to a larger conspiracy . A conspiracy . Involving the FBI . John Doggett and I are running a legitimate investigation into the FBI . - Neither one of us feels ... - Agent Reyes , I 'm trying to help you keep your job ... but that 's not going to happen if you insist on chasing shadows , chasing conspiracies . How do you know there isn 't one ? You 're taking on ... the entire FBI here , Monica . This witch hunt ... isn 't going to expose anything ... but you . That is , unless you distance yourself from John Doggett . What are you doing ? I 'm distancing myself , Brad , from you . From your political games . You just want to get John Doggett . You 're making a big mistake here . Yeah , I seem to make one every time I walk in your door . Lie back , John . It 's okay . What the hell is this ? It 's Shannon . Shannon McMahon . We were together in Bravo Company , USMC . You were trying to contact me . What the hell are you doing here now ? Your lungs were full of water . You pulled me under . I did what I had to . You held me down . I remember . They would have caught you . They might have figured it out . What you 've started to figure out . What are you ? You know what I am . I 'm the product of 50 years of military science . The program your old friend Knowle Rohrer told you about . I 'm a bioengineered combat unit . I have no weaknesses . I don 't sleep . I can breathe underwater . That 's how I saved your life , John . How do you know what I know ? What Knowle Rohrer told me ? Knowle Rohrer and I were drafted right out of Bravo Company together . We were ... Adam and Eve . The program 's first . There are many more now . Knowle Rohrer is dead . You can 't kill us . We can 't be killed . Knowle Rohrer and I are alike in almost every way . The difference is , I hate what I am . Why are you here telling me this ? The program 's expanding in ways no one ever dreamed of . I need your help to stop it , John . You need my help ? What can I do ? Expose the deaths of those two men I killed . What they were doing . What were they doing ? Preparing the water supply . Preparing it for what ? What are you doing , Captain ? Where are you going ? We 're under strict orders not to leave ship . Look at us . They 've got us tied up at a civilian dock in Baltimore . Why ? I think they may be on to us . You 're only drawing suspicion if they 're not . You can 't leave this ship . We can 't risk waiting . We can 't risk not making contact now . I 'll be back . Hi . I 'm sorry about the hour . I just put him down . I couldn 't talk on the phone . Well , what is it ? I was told ... to leave this alone . You and Mulder asked me to leave it be . To let Mulder disappear . We were concerned for the safety of the baby and for Mulder . Why am I risking that now ? Why are you ? Why are you getting mixed up with Doggett 's investigation ? Something happened ... with my baby . What ? I can 't explain it . It 's , uh ... it 's unexplainable . It 's , um ... it 's not normal . Whatever it is ... I think you 've made a terrible mistake . Letting Doggett pull you into this . I mean , he 's hell-bent . And Agent Reyes is following right in his tracks . I need answers . I need to know . I can 't just sit around wondering . If you can 't tell me , then get to Mulder . - Tell him what happened . - No . Mulder can 't know . He can 't be brought back into this . He can 't be brought back to the FBI . It 's just too dangerous for him right now . It 's too dangerous for everyone . The EPA employee you 're trying to reach , Carl Wormus , is not available . If you want to leave a voice mail , stay on the line . Good evening , Captain . Something 's wrong . Very wrong . Sir ... What is this ? Where 's Bamford ? Chief Petty Officer Bamford has been relieved of his post , sir . I 'm your new second in command . Hello . Dana ? I 'm sorry if I woke you . It 's Monica Reyes . Dana ... there 's something I think you really need to be aware of . Something you need to hear . Something I 'm not sure I believe . I 'm listening . It 's not me you need to hear it from . Agent Scully ... we may have some answers for you about your baby . Dana , this is Shannon McMahon . Hi . Let 's start with the water . Well , you 're a scientist . You 'll appreciate the science involved . A new additive is being put in the water supply . It 's called chloramine . It 's not news . Well , let me say it 's been reported but no one 's asking questions yet . And what should they be asking ? If you want to deliver something to everyone 's home in America , what better way than through what 's most taken for granted- - water ? Look , I 've had my fair share of outrageous conspiracy theories , okay ? So cut the mystery crap and get to the science . Chloramine is just a substitute for chlorine . You can drink it and it 's harmless . Unless someone were to quietly go and change its molecular makeup . Who and how ? I think you 'd be more interested in why . All right , then , why ? To prime a population to breed a generation of super soldiers . By adding something to our water ? Something which promotes the mutation of offspring in fertilization , in pregnancy . What you 're saying is absurd . Is it ? No more absurd than I am . I am a first-generation prototype . Now they 're seven stages advanced in the science which created me . To the point where now they have successfully given birth to a super soldier from a mutated egg . How can we trust any of this ? Or you ? What you say you are ? We all have a standard mutation . What are you looking at ? Ship 's logs . Those logs are classified . As second in command , I 'm supposed to know the ship , sir ... in case something should happen to you . What is the greater mission of this ship , if I may ask , sir ? I don 't ask . We don 't ask . What 's going on ? Bamford , sir . Officer Bamford . It doesn 't make any sense . Yeah . Only it doesn 't hold up to any argument , either , does it ? She drowned that man from the EPA . She 's drowned two men . She says they 're part of the program . Two guys working to spike the Maryland state water supply . So she killed them as a way of contacting you ? You believe that ? You saw that thing on her neck . You said you saw it before . I think we 're on to something here , Monica . I mean , it 's freaky . It 's mind-blowing . You got to admit that . Come on . I 'm not doubting what she is ; only what she says she 's doing . What ? What 'd you find ? Nothing . Nothing more than a small deformity of the spine . I mean , physically , she seems absolutely normal . As normal as you or I. I don 't believe this . What don 't you believe , Agent Doggett ? I just examined her . And I 'm standing here with both of you telling me that you don 't see what 's right in front of us . She 's the key to everything in this case right to the FBI . Well , for your sake , I hope so . But I hope not for mine . John Doggett . Agent Doggett , I don 't want to be making this call . I really don 't , but I 'm forced to . What are you talking about ? You want to turf me now ? ! You going to take my badge and gun ? Agent Doggett , you just can 't burst in here . How 's it going to look , Deputy Director- - you suspending me right before I nail you up against the wall as a co-conspirator ? Glad you dropped in , Mr. Doggett . Assistant Director Follmer . You 're Brad Follmer ? I was just explaining to the deputy director the reasons why you were being suspended , but , uh ... I think your actions here speak for themselves . I see what this is . This is just a little bureaucratic pimp job . I 'd watch your mouth , John . What this is is a testament to your gross insubordination and reckless disregard for the FBI . The orders start here and then they come out your wishy-washy mouth . Paranoia must go with the job . You 're starting to sound just like Fox Mulder , Mr. Doggett . Don 't you " Mr. Doggett " me . I don 't answer to you . I answer to A.D. Skinner . The job suspension stands , Mr. Doggett . Try and stop me . You just never know who 's going to come a-knocking , do you ? How 'd you get in here ? Through the front door with a big howdy do . How 'd you get in ? Through a security checkpoint . Kid stuff . What are you doing here ? You sent us hacking on this investigation of yours , only we had a small funding fiasco . They cut our Internet service . Don 't tell me you breached FBI security just to log on . I think you want to see this . Uh , um , not this . Okay , this is what we meant to show you . We are live in the EPA phone system . The numbers in red are calls to Deputy Administrator Carl Wormus after he drowned . Who 'd be calling him at work after it 's front page news that he 's dead ? Someone who doesn 't know it . Whoever it is , they 're calling him again as we speak . Langly ! Hook up a patch cord ! Hurry ! Pick up the phone . What ? Carl Wormus . I 've been trying to reach you . They 've ordered us to port . One of my men is dead . I think they suspect what we 're up to . Right . Uh ... What 's it you need from us ... me on this end ? Just like we talked about . You 're going to call the FBI . Right . You 've got to get to the FBI and tell them about the lab they 've got on board ... about the horrors and the inhumanity . Expose these people for what they are . I need to talk to you . I have an appointment . Don 't do this to me , Brad . Give me two minutes . Here you are again , Monica . Walking through my door . I need your help . Ah . I tried to help you . I 'm asking you again . Okay . I 'm listening . There 's a woman working at the Department of Justice- - Shannon McMahon . I need her case files . You say that like it 's something I can just do . It 's not . It 's important to me . Important to you and to Agent Doggett , in other words . You 're on the wrong side of this fight , Brad . - I can show you . - Trust me . I had it illustrated by Mr. Doggett himself in the deputy director 's office today . Would you listen to me ? People 's lives are in danger here . He 's being set up . We are being set up . By whom ? The Justice Department ? It 's why I need those files . I 'd ask you to just do this for me ... But he 's a good man . He believes he 's in the right . And you ? You always are ? Where 's Shannon McMahon ? She 's back in my house . Why ? What 's this about ? She 's lying to you . She 's not who you think . Where are you getting this ? Everywhere I look . She works for the Department of Justice . Did you know that ? I got a peek at her case files . Those two men she killed , they 'd contacted her at DOJ- - as whistle-blowers . She said they conspired with the government . They were part of the program . They were killed because they wanted to expose the program . Why is she lying ? Why come to me ? Because there 's still one man she can 't pinpoint , and she wants you to lead her to him . How , when I don 't even know who the hell you 're talking about ? He 's captain of a Navy ship that spends 12 months a year at sea . He had been in guarded contact with both dead men about a secret lab on that ship . Right now , Shannon McMahon 's the only sure thing we have in this investigation . We cut out on her and go to this ship of yours , we risk coming up with both hands empty . Agent Doggett , if this is true about this ship and about this lab , there may be answers there that I can 't risk not knowing . Dr. Nordlinger ? A message for you , sir . I want every hard drive . All the data you 've got in this butcher shop you 're running here . Where is this captain supposed to be ? We 're supposed to meet him at a phone booth at 1 : 00 a.m. It 's ten to . Somebody 's already there . Is he calling or meeting you ? I don 't know . It wasn 't clear . He sees us . Hold up , there ! I said , hold up , there ! This ain 't no captain . Who is it ? Knowle Rohrer . Run . Now ! You didn 't trust me . You see anybody ? Nobody . This can 't be right . What happened to the captain ? I think we found the captain . They 're scuttling the ship . Agent Scully . Agent Reyes ! This must be it . Monica ! Dana ! Agent Scully ! Agent Reyes ! In here . Move out . We got to get out of here . You see what this is ? Agent Scully , we got to go ! The ship 's gonna blow , Agent Scully ! But they 're manipulating ova- - females eggs for transplantation . Look at these names . These are test subjects . Grab her , Monica . We got less than a minute to get out of here . Just give me a second . We got no time ! No . Let go . Let me do this , okay ? I just ... I have to see if I 'm here . My name , my baby 's name . You want to see your baby again ? We got no time , Dana . We 'll find another way . Deputy Director . My sources tell me you 've wrapped up your investigation , John . I have my report ready , sir . Yes . How do I come out ? " Super soldiers , a Navy ship ... " a woman at the Department of Justice who drowned two men . " All disappeared now , but which constitute a conspiracy like a cancer in the U.S. government . " Not a mention of my name , John . No , sir . I found nothing on you . Nothing damning I could honestly include in my report , let me say . And because I got nothing to lose , let me say that I know your hands are dirty on this thing , sir- - filthy . That 's why you 're here . Take a last wild punch before the bell . There 's one thing I can 't figure , and then I 'll be on my way . Is why you slipped that obituary under my door . You think I did that ? Over and over in my mind , it had to be you . You 're the only one that had a reason . What 's my reason ? You tell me . You looking just to get me fired or get me killed ? You ever hear of King George III ? You answer my question ! He was King of England when America declared independence in 1776 . King George III kept a diary . On July 4 , 1776 , he made an entry in it . " Nothing important happened today . " What the hell does that got to do with me ? Revolution started . Things that changed the world forever . And even kings can miss them if they 're not paying attention . Are you saying you left that obituary to help me ? To help me find the things that I found ? Nah ... why would I believe that you 'd help me ? Agent Mulder believed me . Mulder ? What the hell are you talking about ? Mulder 's long gone . Say I told Mulder that he would be killed if he stayed . Same people who threatened to kill me if I didn 't go along . Would you believe that , John ? No . Mulder wouldn 't hear it , not from you , not from anybody . I said I told him to go . I didn 't say I persuaded him . Oh , my God . It was Scully . Scully made him go . That 's it , isn 't it ? Going to the basement ? Heard you got a stay of execution . Congratulations . I 'm sure you mean that . No , I 'm sure the deputy director has you just where he wants you . Don 't get me wrong , I 'm a friend to the X Files . Kind of a comfort having you down there , Mr. Doggett . Hi . Hi . Just so long as you know where to reach us ... Mr. Follmer . Everything 's going to be okay . Go back to sleep , okay ? I made this .

 Minions , your Baron has returned . All hail Baron Underbheit ! I wish to be brought up to date on all affairs of Underland . Catclops , what have you to report ? Tourism has skyrocketed at the Well of Bitter Sorrows ... and Underbheit Birth Crevasse ... since you enacted the mandatory attendance edict . Told you . Girl Hitler ? Benzine chewables have doubled production in the child slave mines . Dilly-dallying saw a brief spike ... but we stabilized it by removing the feet of the alpha males ... und the popular girls ! Good . Good . Manic Eightball , how are things in RD ? Excellent . My friends , let us give a toast to me . You have all drunk deep of my cup of villainous plenty . Perhaps too deep . It 's come to my attention that each of you at this hallowed table has betrayed me . - Sir , I ... - Silence ! Your pleas for mercy will not be heard . I know all about the skimming off the top , the planned coup d 'etat ... und , yes , the whispered comments and poorly-drawn caricatures . You stand guilty . However , you all know me as a fair man . I see no reason why we can 't simply part ways amicably . I 'll allow you to gracefully resign your posts in the court of Underland ... and that will be the end of it ... and just to prove I hold no grudges ... I have prepared a special parting gift for each of you from my recent trip . If you 'll kindly look beneath your chairs ... Uh , Tiger Balm . I don 't get it . Well , maybe he 's saying he 's sore at us , and so he 's giving us balm to soothe . That 's retarded . Sir , what exactly ... Where 'd he go ? I knew it . I knew it . He 's gonna kill us , isn 't he ? Aw , crap ! Shall I have the maintenance crew clean the room , my master ? No , not yet , manservant . Tiger bomb . A most thorough and decisive action , your brilliance . You have eliminated all of the enemies of Underland in one fell swoop . No , manservant , not all of them . One yet remains ... Venture . No . Brock , I 'm begging you here . You couldn 't pick a worse time for this . Same time every year . You know that . I haven 't finished the security system yet . What if something happens ? We 're naked in the breeze here . I left the number of the National Guard on the fridge . You 'll be fine . Bye , Brock . Have fun on your sabotage . Sabbatical , doofus . Nice try , Hank . Come on . Get going . Aw , can 't I come with ? Sorry , Runs with Scissors . Need to do this alone . OK , Brock . Hey , watch this . I almost got it down . That 's real good , Hank . Hey , you hold the fort for me while I 'm gone , OK ? You 're the man of the house now . Brock , can 't you wait just one more d ... What the hell are you smiling about ? Brock said I 'm the man of the house while he 's gone . Oh , so you think you 're a big man now , huh ? No ... sir . Think you can take on your old dad , huh ? I knew this day would come . Go on , big man . Take your best shot . What do you mean , Pop ? No ! Stop it , you two ! This family is tearing apart ! You proud of yourself , big man ? Look what you 're doing to your poor brother . Oh , what the hell ? Sorry , sir . Road 's closed by order of the United States Army . I 'm with the Office of Secret Intelligence , soldier . What 's all this ? Sorry , sir . I wouldn 't have expected you in a civilian vehicle ... not that it 's not cherry , sir . I 'll radio General Causeway to ... No , no . I 'm just here for RR . Seriously , sir , if you just follow the flares up this road ... I wasn 't joking . You telling me I can 't camp here , son ? You mean , you 're not here with the ... You 're here to camp ? What 's going on here ? Routine exercises . Wait ! Sir ! Can I have your autograph ? Who was that ? Brock [ Bleep ] - ing Samson . No way ! Dibs on his cigarette butt . No , no , no . Hey ! What the hell are you doing here ? It is you who has no right to intrude on Underland business . Get off . Get off . What is this ? Out front right now ! Boys , wake up . We 're being invad ... Holy Toledo ! Pop 's in trouble ! What do you dicks want ? The butterfly people will leave at once ... that we may slay the Dr. Venture in the name of the Underland . Jeez , they 're really cut . Shut up . No way ! We 're under orders from the Monarch to kill Venture ourselves . But we 're supposed to bring back his mandible as a souvenir for our lord . Shush ! Never share the details of our master 's plan with outsiders . All right . Look . I got to call this in to headquarters . You clowns call your guy and meet us back here . Ja . All right ... but not because you say so . - Why ? - We 're too late ! Pop 's been stung by a tarantula and a scorpion . - He 's delirious . - Holy crap , what do we do ? The first thing you do is tie a tourniquet to stop the toxins from reaching his brain . Check . While I do that , you go to the lab and see if there 's any antivenom in the first-aid kit . Good thinking . Um , where are we , anyway ? I don 't know , but that looks like a door . Hey , the lab 's right here . When did dad build this ? - Time 's a-wastin ' , Deano . - Right . Halt ! Who goes there ? Pop , you 're al ... Intruder ! Intruder ! You are trespassing on Venture Industries property . Prepare to be destroyed . Hank ! What are you doing ? Knock it off ! This Freudian phase of yours has gone too far , mister . You 're ground ... What the hell was that ? Destroy intruder . Destroy intruder . I live here ! Leave me alone ! Something out there , and it 's made of metal , And it has Dad 's face , and it wants to beat me up . This is just like my dream . Yeah , but did you get the first-aid kit ? I don 't need first aid , Hank . I need you to stop choking me and hitting me with fire extinguishers . But , Pop , you 're bleeding . Oh , this . Uh , no . It 's fairly common for some men to lactate involuntarily ... in situations of extreme stress . Dean 's lactating , too . Oh , somebody loves the Monarch . Monarch speaking . What ? Well , slay him . What 's the problem ? How many ? Underbheit ? Of all the ... No , no . Just sit tight , Twenty-four . I 'll call a sit-down . Nobody is to make a move until I 've had it out with Underbheit . - Unbelievable . - What ? Get Baron Underbheit on the phone . - Why ? What 's going on ? - Just do it , woman ! Man ! Do it yourself , Mr. Big Pants . Fine . Wait a minute . How do I get an ... outside line ? Who 's there ? Identify yourself . Intruder . Kill intruder . Not to worry , boys . That door is eight inches of tempered steel . We 're perfectly safe here . Intruder . Kill . Let 's not test it , Hank . He 's made out of the same stuff . - What does it want ? - His name is G.U.A.R.D.O ... and I designed him to protect us while Brock 's away . Then why did he try to break my face ? Because I haven 't programmed it into his friendly file yet . I fell asleep . Right now , G.U.A.R.D.O. Doesn 't know you or I ... from an army of snake people hopped up on PCP . But hey , that 's what a panic room is for , right ? We 'll be fine if we stay here till Brock shows up . Brock . Come in , Brock . G.U.A.R.D.O ? Hey , does that stand for something ? Hello . It 's Doc . Come on . It 's an emergency , and I can 't get to the fridge . Those are for company . He 's late . Royalty . That 's how they are . What is this , diet ? Why did you get diet ? - I didn 't . - Taste this , then . OK . I might have grabbed the wrong bottle at the supermarket . How do you do that ? How can you not tell the difference ? God , it 's like having my dad do the shopping . - He 's here . - Places , everyone , places . Now ! All right , all right . Knock it off . We tried . Whatever . Is it over ? You can come out now . We 're done . You are supposed to stay on your side ! Yeah . Look . It 's probably gonna be a while here ... and we got some beers and stuff over at the Monarch-mobile , so I thought ... Don 't you lay a hand on my Sasquatch ! Why don 't you government bastards leave us in peace ? I 'm not here with the government . - I just want to ... - Don 't you lie to me . I know who you are . You 're Brock Samson . You 're with O.S.I. Bionic , huh ? Let 's see how bionic . Right in my Cape Canaverals . Wait a minute . I know you , too . You 're Steve Summers , astronaut . - Former astronaut . - I thought you died . That 's what everyone was meant to think . True , I was barely alive after my test ship broke up ... but the army saved me . They spent six million dollars to give me all-new bionic parts . Made me stronger , better , faster than I was . Then you know what they did ? They put me to work . They expected me to pay it all back . Do you have any idea how long six million bucks takes to pay off ... on a government salary ? And these are our holding cells . I 'm sure Underland has much larger ones ... you being a whole country and all . Underland has no prisons . Really ? How progressive . The master has instated the death penalty for all infractions of Underlaw . You have to give me this one . I 've loathed Venture ever since college . Oh , who hasn 't , Underpants ? What makes your case so special ? Wow . You mean , he did that ? How ? Where I come from , a lab partnership is a sacred trust . One is always supposed to look out for one 's lab partner . Venture did not . Fine , fine , but you have to understand . You can 't waltz into the middle ... of a delicate , high-stakes chess tournament ... and yell " king me " just because he bitched up your face . Venture and I have been engaged in a deadly game ... of cat and also cat for years . Allow me to enlighten you . Behold ! But a small glimpse into the genius that is my 37-point on-going plan ... to ruin Dr. Venture 's life . Nope . That 's my resume . Hold on . Damn it ! Oh , hang on a second . No , no . Let me ... Here . Let me just reboot this . I ... Have a lot of extensions . Destroy . Destroy intruders . Man . Enough already . We get it . Listen , boys . Brock is still not answering . It 's too bad H.E.L.P.eR. Isn 't here ... to teach this bucket of bolts some manners . H.E.L.P.eR. is a real robot . H.E.L.P.eR. Of course . H.E.L.P.eR. Come in , H.E.L.P.eR. H.E.L.P.eR. Can you read me ? Oh , where is he now ? Maybe H.E.L.P.eR. got jealous of your new robot ... and he 's mad at you . Oh , of all the ridiculous ... Robots don 't have fee ... H.E.L.P.eR ? Listen to me . I 'm sorry . I need ... Rusty needs your help . When they closed the plant , there weren 't a lot of jobs for me . All I got is a G.E.D. It was either this or the army . In Underland , all citizens are required to serve in his lordship 's infantry ... from the ages of twelve to thirty-seven . At thirty-eight , we are executed . When I met the Monar ' , I was hooked on cra ' ' ocaine . I get in all kind of trouble . Monarch turn my life around . How about you ? Why 'd you join up ? You guys kidnapped me when I was fifteen . Personally , I like the discipline . Plus , it 's a great way to see Underland . You know what ? Let 's have some real fun . So what , we can 't get in there ? Let 's do some damage anyway . And that 's when I met my little Sasburger here . Well , cupid must 've been using bionic arrows that day ... because I took one look in those big , blue eyes ... and I knew I couldn 't go through with my mission ... or any mission ever again . The army might 've given me a new body , but Sasquatch gave me a new life . We 've been on the run ever since . They 're coming . Don 't worry , baby . I 'm not gonna let them get you . You better get out of here , Samson . This might get ugly , and you 're still with the Agency . Now wait a minute . I have a better idea . Come here . This is your bionic one , right ? That was hooked up to my brain . Better lose the bright red tracksuit , too . - But that 's my thing . - As for you ... No ! Wait ! What are you doing ? OK . Are you there , H.E.L.P.eR ? Now , what you want to do is plug directly into the primary CPU . Once you do that , you 'll be able to reboot the system . Once it reboots , enter the ... It worked . G.U.A.R.D.O. ' s leaving . H.E.L.P.eR. did it ! Go , Team H.E.L.P.eR ! We 're in . All right , henchmen . This is it . Let 's get that bastard ! Halt ! Identify yourselves . Intruders . Intruders . Destroy . Oh , it 's good to see you again , Mr. Samson . You got some , uh ... friends ? Just some buddies from my old unit . They do this every year . You ever seen heavy combat , son ? You should look so good after stepping on a land mine . Well , I 'm sorry , sir . Go on ahead . What are you doing ? Why 'd you let him go ? What ? It 's just a bunch of vets camping . Dude , that was a shaved Bigfoot and Steve Summers in a wig ... made out of shaved Bigfoot . That was close . Thanks , Brock . You can drop us off at the bus station . Sasquatch has family up in Canada . We 'll probably head up there . You could 've told me Sasquatch was a ... a dude . - You couldn 't tell ? - Not until I had to ... shave him . What are you , shy ? Sasquatch doesn 't have anything you haven 't seen before . Sasquatch is something I haven 't seen before ! Well , that 's a fantastic idea , Underbheit ... a team-up . Well , I couldn 't have thought of it without your input . Don 't we need to file an Article of Collusion ... with the Guild of Calamitous Intent first ? You 're right . Screw protocol . Go ahead and call them . Oh , the henchmen are going to be thrilled . They 're not answering . What the f ... Intruder . Come on , H.E.L.P.eR. I apologized . What more do you want ? Oh , damn it ! That 's good soup .

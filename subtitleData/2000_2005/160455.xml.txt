 [ Electronic Beeping ] [ Panting ] [ Gasping ] You got to breathe , Kath . In and out , in and out . You 're panting . Can 't we just go home and start this all over again tomorrow ? You 're in safe hands now . [ Loud Groan ] How are we doing , Ms. McCready ? I think she 's getting ready . I 'll check on her dilation . If she 's close , then we 'll call Dr. Lev . [ Rapid Beeping ] What is that ? What 's that sound ? It 's the baby 's heart monitor . What 's happening , Duffy ? Something 's happening . Nurse , get the team in here for an emergency C-section . Why ? What 's wrong ? Baby 's having some trouble some distress . We 'll take care of it . We know what to do . You just lie back now . Sir , you 'll have to scrub if you 're going to be here . - Duffy ? - It 's all right . I 'll be right back . Don 't wait for me . Please , please , just don 't let anything happen to my baby . Just lie back now . Let us do our work . I can 't ... I can 't feel anything . Something 's wrong , isn 't it ? [ Man ] Lie down now , Mrs. McCready . You better hit her again . [ Kath ] Something wrong with my baby ? Your baby 's just fline . Let me see . What is it ? Is it a boy ? Oh , my God ... Oh , my God . [ Eerie Mewling ] Oh , my God , what is it ? Duffy . Put her under . Duffy . [ Doggett ] Agent Scully ... - Hi . - Hi . I 'm sorry , Agent Doggett I didn 't realize that you had an appointment . This is Duffy Haskell . He says he knows you or you know him . I 'm sorry . I don 't remember . I contacted you about my wife about eight years ago because she was an alien abductee . That was before my time here . But , uh , is there something I can help you with ? She 's dead . My wife is dead now . They killed her . Kath- - my wife . [ Doggett ] I checked the filles . Mr. Haskell wrote several letters to Agent Mulder describing his wife 's abduction experiences . My wife gave birth to an alien . I-I thought you said that your wife was murdered . That 's the reason they did it . Okay , Mr. Haskell . Why don 't you , uh , start from the beginning . Kath was a multiple abductee . The aliens did these procedures on her . Tests and whatnot . One procedure would give her cancer while another one would cure her . Stuff like that . For years , you see . And then , this year , they came right into our bedroom and implanted an alien embryo in Kath . I don 't suppose that you have any medical proof of this . I have an ultrasound here . Anyone with a trained eye can see that is a bizarre pregnancy . Especially for a woman who was never supposed to be able to conceive . I doubt you 'd ever get the doctors to cop to any of that . What doctors ? We 've been through three sets . They 're all in on it . They 're all in cahoots . So you 're ... saying that it was the doctors that killed your wife ? And stole the alien baby . That ultrasound is proof . Do you , uh ... have all the information and numbers and a way that we can reach Mr. Haskell ? Uh , we 'll be in touch . Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you , Agent Doggett . I 'm sure the rest of my afternoon can 't possibly be so amusing . I thought you 'd fiind it interesting , actually . Interesting ? As in preposterous and outrageous ? Well , unless I 'm mistaken you already knew that man 's story . The abduction the tests , a bout with cancer then a remission . What exactly are you getting at ? That 's your story , Agent Scully . I 'd say right down to a tee . I mean , except for the pregnancy . It 's all right there in the X-Files . Well , I appreciate your thoroughness Agent Doggett , and your familiarity with the X-Files cases in those cabinets but my personal filles are my personal filles . Okay ? Sure , of course . There you are . I 've been looking all over for you . Hi . Um , I 'm sorry . I had a doctor 's appointment and , um , I don 't know I guess time just got away from me . Is anything the matter ? Nothing . No , I just , uh ... I went for a walk . Then what 's wrong ? I 'm ... I 'm sorry I haven 't told you . I don 't know why I haven 't . I mean , you were always there for me during my illness but , um ... Don 't make me guess . I was left unable to conceive with whatever test that they did on me . And I am not ready to accept that I will never have children . [ Elevator Door Dings ] Scully , there 's , um , there 's something I haven 't told you either and I hope you forgive me and understand why I would have kept it from you . What ? During my investigation into your illness I found out the reason why you were left barren . Your ova were taken from you and stored in a government lab . What ? You found them ? I-I took them directly to a specialist who would tell me if they were okay . I don 't believe this . Scully , you were deathly ill , and I ... I couldn 't bear to give you another piece of bad news . Is that what it was ? It was bad news ? The doctor said that the ova weren 't viable . I want a second opinion . [ Elevator Door Dings ] Agent Scully ? What are you doing ? Um , I don 't know . I guess I just forgot to push the button . I wasn 't exactly clear on what you wanted to do about this guy Haskell . About his wife 's story . There 's nothing to do . Hello . Is anybody here ? [ Faint Voices ] [ Woman ] This is my baby . I have to know ... [ Man ] Ms. Hendershot , try to stay calm . I 'm doing all I can ... . [ Voices Grow Louder ] No , listen to me . You don 't know , you don 't know . Just try and stay calm . There are no similarities between your baby and the others . How can you say that ? You don 't know that . Because I know both cases . Try to keep her as calm as possible . I 'm going to get another doctor . No , no , I 'm not staying here . I 'm not staying here . [ Man ] Who are you ? What are you doing here ? I 'm , um , I 'm here with my friend . You 're here with Ms. Hendershot ? Yes . I 'm worried about her . Ms. Hendershot is fline . But you 'll have to wait up front , please . You can 't be back here . [ Woman ] Parenti Medical Group . Yes , I want to speak with Dr. Parenti , please . This is his service . I can reach him if it 's an emergency . Yes , it is . It 's Dana Scully . [ Man ] Dana ? What 's wrong ? I 'm afraid . Tell me what it is . I want you to look at something for me . Right away . It 's an ultrasound . Well , I 'm not in my offiice right now . Can you send it over there ? I 'll look at it as soon as possible . I want you to compare it to mine . Dana ... are you going to be okay ? Yes . Fine , I 'm ... I 'm okay . All right , I 'll get back to you , Dana . Thank you . Ms. Scully ? Got a good report for you . I 've looked at the ova you 've given me and consulted with some of my colleagues . We all feel that with the proper approach we might be successful . Got a good chance to get you pregnant . Oh ... It 's too good to be true . I don 't want to lay odds but it 's not out of the realm of possibility if we start soon . We can start right away ? Well , you need a father , of course . I can get you genetic counseling on fiinding an anonymous donor if that 's what you want ... unless you already have someone in mind . Yeah ... I , uh ... I just have to fiigure out how to ask him . Dana ? You want to come on back ? What did you fiind ? I looked at this ultrasound you sent me and ... I don 't know what I 'm supposed to be seeing but it looks fline to me . As does your own ultrasound . You didn 't see anything strange ? Why do you ask that ? I just want to be sure . I 've had ... complications . It 's normal to be worried . Okay . Thank you . Your only concern right now is when you 're going to tell the FBI . Can 't keep it a secret forever , Dana . You 're going to start showing soon . Right . About an ultrasound you left there this morning . Dr. Parenti is my doctor . Come on , Agent Scully . You don 't believe me ? That ultrasound is the one Duffy Haskell left here yesterday . Dr. Parenti is one of the doctors he consulted with during the course of that pregnancy . Excuse me , Agent Doggett , but are you investigating me ? No , I was doing a background check on Mr. and Mrs. Haskell before I dropped the case , like you asked me to do . No , I didn 't ask you to drop the case . I said there was nothing to do . Well , if there 's nothing to do , then why are you investigating ? You are jumping to conclusions . No , I 'm just trying to do my job , only it gets hard to do if the person you 're working with is keeping secrets and telling lies . I am not investigating these people , Agent Doggett . Parenti is my doctor . Is that so strange ? Is there something about him I don 't know ? No . But Duffy Haskell is a piece of work . I 'll tell you that much . What am I being accused of ? What did you call me in here for ? You were going to help me . [ Skinner ] As President of the Ohio Mutual UFO Network you sentAgent Mulder a series of very threatening letters which he passed on to me , Mr. Haskell . Something of a habit with you , sir . Writing letters ... threatening letters . Isn 't it ? No one will believe me . You wrote a letter to a Dr. Lev saying you would kill him if he hurt your wife . Dr. Lev killed my wife . He stole the alien baby out of her womb . Well , I can 't fiind any documentation that the two of you were even married , Mr. Haskell . Let alone any history or evidence of foul play . Dr. Lev is a serious physician a leader in the fileid of birth defects . His peers hold him in the highest regard . Why would he ever kill your wife ? That 's why I came to you . Mr. Haskell , allegations aside it 's a crime to threaten anyone . You believe me , don 't you ? [ Skinner ] Mr. Haskell , we 're sorry for your loss but if you persist in these threats and in disseminating these stories we 're going to have to enter your name in the federal system as a dangerous individual . I 'm alone now because of them . They took everything from me . And there are other women out there just like Kath . [ Phone Ringing ] Zeus Genetics , Dr. Lev speaking . They called me back here to the FBI to poke holes in my story . As we knew they would . We still risk losing Hendershot . Then it 's time to let her go . [ Knock On Door ] - Hi . - Hi . Come on in . Can I take your coat ? No , I can 't stay . I gotta get back to the offiice for a while . Obviously you 've had some time to think about my request . Um , it 's ... it 's not something that I get asked to do every day . Um , but I am absolutely flattered . No , honestly . Okay , if ... if you 're trying to politely say " " no , " it 's okay . I , I understand . See what 's weird is ... this sounds , and this sounds really weird , I know but I , I just wouldn 't want this to come between us . Yeah . I know ... I , I understand . I do . But ... the answer is " " yes . " Um- - Well , I 'll call Dr. Parenti and ... I assume that he 'll want to meet you and go through the , uh , the donor procedure . At that part , I 'm a pro . [ KnockAt Door ] My name is Mary Hendershot . My baby 's in danger . So is yours . Can I have some coffee- - black , please ? Sure . Thanks for coming down here . Yeah . You going somewhere ? Yes . Am I missing something here ? Agent Doggett as Assistant Director in Charge of your assignment Agent Scully has come to me and asked to take a leave of absence . Hey , great . Can I ask why ? No . So I 'm the X-Files now ? Just me ? Agent Scully isn 't quitting the FBI she 's just going away . Thanks for getting me out of bed to give me the news . Drop me a line if you get a chance . You gotta tell him , Scully . I can 't . Agent Doggett ? I want you to understand . What is it you want me to understand , Agent Scully ? The secrets or the lies ? I told you ... I 'm not doing anything behind your back . You 're supposed to watch my back , Agent Scully . If I was putting you at risk in any way you can be sure that I wouldn 't let you down . I hope you know that . I only know what you tell me . [ Quiet Sigh ] I gotta go . Who 's that ... in Agent Scully 's car ? That I don 't know , Agent Doggett . [ Engine Starting ] You 're Scully ? Agent Scully ? Yes , Dana Scully . This is Ms. Hendershot . Mary Hendershot . I 'm Dr. Miryum . These are the best team of obstetricians one could hope to assemble . Now you tell them what you told me . Ms. Hendershot believes that she is carrying a baby that is not her own . That , by whatever means , at 40 weeks she is about to give birth to something inhuman . Does she have medical records ? I can 't trust my doctors . She believes , and with possible good reason that her life may be in danger . That women just like her have been murdered in childbirth . Why ? Because it sounds insane . These doctors killed a friend of mine because she was on to them . Because she saw too much . You should know that I 'm not just here as an FBI agent . Agent Scully is an MD . So what is it she 's carrying ? That 's why we 've come to you . All right . Let 's get Ms. Hendershot prepped and ready . For what ? You 're going to have this baby , Ms. Hendershot . Our big concern right now is you have it safely . Whatever it is in you we 'll know in a few hours from now if we induce labor immediately . How did this woman fiind you ? A man named Haskell led her to me . His pregnant wife is now dead . Dr. Miryum ... she 's not the only woman whose life is in danger . Agent Farah . I didn 't see you in here , John . What are you doing in the dark ? I 'm in the dark pretty much most of my time on the X-Files , Joe . Got a little something you may want to shine a light on . You had me run this guy Duffy Haskell 's prints , right ? I hate to say that case is closed now , Joe . From what I found , it 's been closed since 1970 . When David Haskell , same prints , was buried in a Virginia cemetery- - USMC Honor Guard ceremony . You 're kidding . I kid you not . Looks like you got yourself a real spook . Or a snake in the grass . How long will this take ? Probably somewhere between four and 12 hours . All my life I wanted children . But I 'm afraid of what 's growing in me . That it even happened . You mean getting pregnant ? I had a boyfriend . When I looked at the dates , there was no way . Now I 'm sure it was an abduction . I 'm sure of what 's inside of me . Agent Scully ... we 're all set for you . You ready for this ? Yeah . At your stage , the fetus is still only about eight centimeters , but we should still be able to get a pretty clear picture of its development . There it is . You see it ? Yeah . I see two legs , two arms and hands . I see what would appear to be a healthy baby at 14 weeks . Are you sure ? The picture doesn 't lie , Agent Scully . Hard to tell , but ... would you like to know the sex ? I just want to be certain that it 's okay . We could do an amnio . It 's a little early , but we could do it if that 's what you want . Knowle ... can I talk to you ? John , what are you doing here ? Your assistant said you were going to get right back to me about this David Haskell fiingerprint . I 've got a day job , John . The government gets suspicious if I work at too fast a pace . I can 't wait , Knowle . It can 't wait . Is it the same guy , or not ? How about we take a walk ? How 'd you hook up with this guy , anyway ? The man was in my offiice , Knowle . Military records show he died in 1970 . What the hell 's the story ? Possible he 's intelligence . Doing what ? Working for who ? What did he say he wanted ? He wanted us to investigate the murder of his wife . He claims she was an alien abductee . Look ... I don 't buy this crap but if the guy 's CIA he wasn 't just in my offiice killing time . Why go to the trouble at all ? All I can think is that there must be documentation in our filles of a conspiracy to hide the truth . About what , extraterrestrials ? Look , it 's not my work . It 's the woman I work with- - an Agent Scully . John , there 's no conspiracy . You and I go back a long time . You know I 'll do anything I can for you . Just give me a little more time to fiind out who this Haskell guy is , okay ? By the end of the day . I know I don 't have to tell you but you need to take it easy now after the procedure . The baby 's at risk if the membrane were to rupture , all right ? Yeah . I just want to know . I 'm anxious about the results . We 're hoping Mrs. Hendershot will deliver in the next few hours . You 're our next priority . Ms. Hendershot ... you have to get up . I have to get you out of here . [ Elevator Dings ] Agent Doggett , what is it ? Scully- - do you know where she is ? How to alert her right away ? - To what ? - I think she 's been misled . We all have by this man Haskell . You think or you know ? I can 't get a straight answer on that which leads me to believe that this was a setup from the start- - that this guy Haskell came to us with his story to getAgent Scully to go wherever she 's gone . I can tell you that she 's in a safe place , Agent Doggett . A hospital . What hospital ? Look , this involves doctors . Doctors who may have killed pregnant women . Now , a hospital could be the worst place in the world for her . Tell me where Scully is . Walden-Freedman Army Hospital . Get on the phone to security there . Tell them everything I told you . [ Ringing ] Security ... Can you do this ? We 've got two patients missing . I need you to follow us . I 'm a friend of John Doggett 's . Who are you ? That 's not important . Get in the car . We 're going to get you out . Go . This woman could give birth at any minute . I hope you realize that . You 're in good hands . These men are experienced fileid medics . Where are you taking us ? We 're going to get you to the closest hospital where we can make sure this kid is born safe . Oh . Are you going to make it ? Yeah , I just ... just had a procedure . I shouldn 't even be on my feet . [ Sirens Blaring ] Who the hell is this ? Get off this road , now . Oh ! Mrs. Hendershot ? [ Panting ] I think it 's coming . We have to stop this car . Not until it 's safe . If you don 't stop this car you could be endangering her life . Stop the car . Just relax , ma 'am . What are you doing ? Making sure you don 't hurt yourself . I 'm fline . Let go of me . It 's for your own good . Who are you ? Ms. Hendershot ... [ Screaming ] Mary ! Agent Scully ... We 're going to have to sedate you . No ! Get in the car . Hey ! [ Hendershot 's Screams Echoing ] [ Eerie Mewling ] [ Echoing Beeping ] [ Steady Beeping ] Agent Doggett ? Agent Scully . What are you doing here ? What am I doing back in this place ? Lie down , Agent Scully . You 're not taking any more chances . What happened to me ? You 're okay . You 're fline . And your baby 's fline . But you 're very , very lucky . What about Ms. Hendershot ? She 's resting fline , too . What about her baby ? Six pounds , eight ounces . A boy . Oh , my God . They switched it . Agent Doggett , they switched it on her . It 's over , Agent Scully . No , it 's not . We can prove this . We can 't prove anything . They say you overreacted to everything . They say you overreacted to fears you had about Ms. Hendershot 's pregnancy to the fears you had about your own . They showed me a tape of another woman 's womb . They say it 's your baby just taped onto an old cassette . Well , then who were those men ? They acted off information that came from me . They say they saved your life . How can I question that , standing here ? It was all planned . You know that . From the moment that man walked into our offiice . We were used to get at Ms. Hendershot 's baby . And now we are being used to cover it up . Oh , my God . At least you 're okay . Why didn 't you tell me ? I was afraid . Afraid that they 'd use it against me to take me off the X-Files so that I couldn 't fiind Mulder . I told you I 'd help you . I said we 'd fiind him . Scully ? I must have dozed off . I was waiting for you to get back . It didn 't take , did it ? I guess it was too much to hope for . It was my last chance . Never give up on a miracle . [ Child ] I made this .

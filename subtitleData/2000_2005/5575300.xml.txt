 At least Jarod could have led us to a place near the Strip ... then I could have hit the craps table . Well , hit this instead : single malt , like you asked for . And you 're forgetting something . Jarod didn 't lead us here . His friend told him to stay here in an e-mail I intercepted . He 's been compromised this time , and he 's gonna walk right into our hands . - My hands . Now go to your room . - Oh , this is my room . Our room . This is the honeymoon suite . Not even after four of these . - Oh , no , no . Miss Parker , it 's perfect . Why do you think Sydney and Lyle are coming tomorrow ? If Jarod came here ... and he saw a woman and three men on the register , well , he 'd - he 'd know we 're here . This way , if - if you and I pretend ... to be the honeymoon couple , well , he 'd be none the wiser . This was your idea . - Yeah . I mean , it 's a good one , isn 't it ? Nobody 'd believe you and Syd . He 's-He 's middle-aged , and he 's Flemish . And you , you 're young and-unless you think that you 'd rather room with Lyle . Centre 's a sick place but - but your own brother ? Relax , Romeo . That 's as far as I go . Take first watch . Anybody pulls into that parking lot , send up a flare . Okay . - Broots ? Fall asleep , it 'll be a hell of a wedding night . Welcome to Sin City-Las Vegas , Nevada . A Pretender could win big here - some other Pretender . I 've been rolling nothing but snake eyes . I should be having some fun in the sun , and all I got is ... frostbite . They say luck is a lady . That must be good luck . Bad luck is definitely a man , and he dresses funny . Argyle tried to sell me to the Centre a couple of years back . Last year he almost got me killed . Why should this year be any different ? Some days it doesn 't pay to answer your e-mail . There are Pretenders among us . I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and abused . - Life 's a gift . You a doctor ? - I am today . Look at me . Some genius . I wish I could pretend myself into some longjohns . But in my own defense , this all started when Argyle decided to become a Pretender . As usual , his mouth was writing checks his brain couldn 't cash . Hello ? Hello ? Ha ! Prepare to die , you mamaluke . Ow ! Ooh ! Ah ! Hey ! Hey ! J-Man ! You made it . - Argyle , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry , J-Dog . You saw the door . This is a dangerous business . And when you 're the mac daddy of private dicks ... the flying ' monkeys-all they wanna do is put you on the night train to Emerald City . You 're lucky you didn 't get your ticket punched , Richard Dixon , private investigator . Oh , no . I ain 't Dick Dixon . I 'm his partner . - So why did you e-mail me ? Why don 't you get him to help you ? Oh . Well , you see , this ain 't Double " D 's " kind of gig . This is what we in the industry call a " multifacetal " type thing . See , there 's a lot of cross-purposing entities , multicultural ... purposes , you know - all of that and what not . Good-bye , Argyle . - No , no , no ! Wait ! J-Dog . J-Dog . You can 't leave me . You can 't leave . You 're all I got , man . I 'm in trouble , Jarod . Please . Raymond Chandler had a secret for writing detective stories . " When in doubt , " he said , " have somebody enter the room with a gun . " Okay , it 's an ice-cream cone . But it was pistachio ... and I 'm allergic to pistachios . You Dick Dixon ? - Me ? No . I 'm his partner . That 's Dick Dixon . Oh ! Ow ! - Think that hurt ? Taste this . Let 's call this story " Death by Double Dip . " Now , our pistachio-packing friend will have to wait ... since the Pretender is now Dick Dixon , private eye . Let me give you the skinny . Argyle 's new job was another epic work of fiction . Dick Dixon isn 't even around anymore . He skipped town last year buried in debt . Argyle had only become his partner a week earlier . He was working the building as a " hospitality technician . " And that 's what he called it . I call it " janitor . " He happened to be scrubbing Dick Dixon 's abandoned office when ... she walked in . I 'm looking for Dick ? Excuse me ? You know-Dick . - Dick ? Dick Dixon ? - Oh . Oh . Dick Dixon . Uh , yeah . Um , no . He 's gone . Gone ? - Yeah . He took the slow boat to China . ... that kind of thing . Do you work for him ? - Do I work for him ? Yeah . - Do I work for him ? I am his nom de plume . I 'm his coup de grace . I am his comrade-in-arms , you know what I 'm sayin ' ? I am his partner , for Pete 's sake . - Um , you do his dirty work ? That 's funny . This mop-you see-I 'm undercover . I 'm what we in the industry call the " clandestinal " partner . Whatever Dick wants , Argyle gets Dick . " Argyle . " That 's an interesting name . Yeah . My parents gave it to me on account of my birthmark . Hey , would you like to see my birthmark ? No . - Oh , no . I 'm sorry . I - I get that a lot . Please don 't cry . I hate to see a girl cry . Here . Take this . There you go . That 's all right . Say , what 's your name ? - Mona . Like the Lisa ? - Yeah . That 's very beautiful . Listen , Mona . I can help . Talk to me . Well , I 'm a showgirl down at the Club Ali Bar ... and my boss is in trouble . Trouble ? What 's your boss 's name ? Dirty Willy . - He doesn 't bathe ? No . People just call him that . He 's a good man , takes care of us , and all the girls have comprehensive dental . Wow . That 's key . - And this bucket of quarters is all he 's got left . And he told me to give this to Mr. Dixon . Okay . I will get this to Mr. Dixon . Willy knows things , Mr. Argyle ... - Oh , yeah ? things that he shouldn 't know . He needs protection . - Consider it done , Ms. Lisa . Argyle is on the case . " Argyle is on the case " Five words to send a chill down your spine . Argyle embraced the cliche , casting himself in the starring role ... of a big-time private eye extraordinaire . Determined to help Mona , he made his way back into the Club Ali Bar ... and , like a true detective , was looking for clues - anything he could find that would lead him to where or what happened to Dirty Willy . But he wasn 't ready to be a star . As soon as things got real , Argyle wished he 'd taken a bit part . Dirty Willy . He 'd done the job , solved the case . He had the killer cornered . So Argyle did what Argyle does best . He never saw the hit man . Who could at that speed ? - Woah ! He was pretty sure the killer didn 't see him-pretty sure . Which brings us back to our pistachio-packin ' porker . He was wondering the same thing as me . Where the hell is Mona ? - Well , I - I - I don 't know . She told me she was comin ' to see you , Dixon . And now she 's gone ? Did she say where she was goin ' ? - She hasn 't told me anything . Did she leave anything ? - Look . Normally , I don 't talk to gun-wielding thugs . Yeah . Your mama must be real proud of you now , eh , big boy ? No . She 'd probably give me a lickin ' . My mama 's dead . Truth is , I 'm not a thug . My name is Mike . I 'm Mona 's brother . Oh . Hi , Mike . - Hi . It just ain 't like her not to check in . Our parents died when we were real little ... and I made a promise to Mom that I 'd take care of Mona . I just gotta know if she 's okay . You will . Just as soon as we find out anything , you 'll be the first to know . I promise . Right , partner ? - Yeah . Dick Dixon is on the case , kickin ' tail and takin ' names . You are Mr. Positivi-tivity , the Shah of " I Can . " Hey , now . Swell ride . Like I always say , private dick 's gotta have a ragtop . You are not going . - What are you talkin ' about ? I am not a detective . You are not my partner . If I 'm going to help , you stay outta my way . That was extremely hostile . I can 't keep saving your life if you keep lying yourself into a corner . You have to think . - Hey ! I 've been thinkin ' . I was - till I met you . Now after you helped me and Pop last year , I 'm mending ' my wicked ways , you know . I ain 't had nothin but honest jobs since . Only thing missin ' is the love of my life . And I met her last week . Mona 's the one . - You spent six minutes with her . 360 glorious seconds , J-Man . Somethin' happened between us , I 'm tellin ' ya . It was like " electronical " chemicals or something . Pheromones , baby , I 'm tellin ' ya . And now my future brother-in-law 's weeping ' in his pistachio . You gotta let me come with you , J-ster . You gotta let me help her . J-Man . J-Dog . Please , I 'm beggin ' ya . Please , please , please , please , please . There are certain times in life when you need to think with your heart , not your head . This wasn 't one of those times , but I thought it was , so I made the following mistake . Please ? - Get in . Yeah , yeah . Argyle is on the case . Come on ! How did I get in this nightmare ? Well , I-I remember I was watching out for Jarod ... and you looked at me with bedroom eyes , like you wanted to do the late-night creep . I did not . We did not . Well , how can you be sure , Miss Parker ? For starters , pigs aren 't flying , hell hasn 't frozen over ... and you 're not the last man on earth . What ? - How 's the stakeout going ? Sydney , how are you ? I ... am fine . Sweeper team says you haven 't reported in . Huh . Something came up . I ... overslept , but - but I was just getting dressed . I 'll be there tomorrow with Lyle and Raines . Parker , is everything all right ? I am rolling nothing but sevens . You so much as hint at this when they arrive ... I will amputate your head . Well , what about this ? - There is no " this . " Nothing happened , Broots . Like I said , it was a nightmare , and I 'm glad I woke up . When you say things like that , do you even consider my feelings ? What is it about me that you find so repulsive ? You really want to know ? - Yes . I really want to know . Okay . Now you shut up and listen . What I find so utterly uninspiring about you ... is your idea of risk is to go without deodorant . When the bullets stop flying , you 're always the one shaking in the corner . That , in the game of life , is second string . And - Hey . Stop , and let me tell you something , and you - you shut up and listen . You 're right . I have never taken a risk . Because the whole time I 've known you , I 've only wanted to take just one . Which one would that be ? You 're in your office . It 's late , and I sneak in . In one hand I have gardenias , and in the other I have a bottle of single malt - two of your favorite things in the world . And I find that little spot on the nape of your neck ... and I just ... rub it the right way ... to get rid of that migraine you always get about 6 : 20 every night - the one you never tell anyone about . The truth is , if I had just one shot ... you know what I 'd do ? I would take your pain away . Truth is , you 'd be lucky to get a scrub like me . Do you hear that , Broots ? - What ? Pigs are flying . Life is strange . One hour in the Nevada sun , and I had more unanswered questions than the Warren Commission . There was Dirty Willy 's murder to solve ... and Mona , the missing showgirl , to track down . But Argyle had to see his father , Benny . The old man used to be obsessed with the pope . I was about to find out he converted . Wayne Newton is more than a holy man . He is the shaman of the Strip . He 's the duke of downtown . Wayne Newton is Las Vegas . - If you say so . You know , I met him once , sort of ? My Adella and I , uh , saw him in Vegas long ago . Who 'd have thought I 'd be back here in Vegas with Argyle ... livin ' in this exquisite golf villa ? Fore ! Driving range is open . - Sorry . Yeah . The only one missing ' is my Adella . This week would 've been our 50th anniversary . She was my inspiration , Jarod . She 's the reason I 'm writin a song for Wayne . Hey , Pop , we-we don 't have time for that . - Oh , sure we do . The big " W , " he changed our lives ... so my Adella suggested that I should write him a song ... sort of a companion piece to " Danke Schoen . " She said , " Call it 'Auf Wiedersehen " ' ... and here goes nothing . Where 's the song ? - It 's still a work in progress . It 'll be ready by tomorrow . What 's happening tomorrow ? - Uh , Wayne is playin ' in a charity tournament ... and he will be right there putting ... and I will be right here standing - # When I hit him with the razzamatazz # You know , I 've never actually played golf , but , um , won 't that disturb his game ? Oh , yeah . Well , yeah , but it 's worth it for my Adella 's last wish , isn 't it ? It 's more than worth it . Yeah . Good . - And the big " W " will love it , Pop ... but we gotta get out of here . We gotta catch ourselves a killer . I got me a song to write . - Catch you later , Pop . It was nice to see Benny again , but Argyle was right . We did have a killer to catch . So we went back to the scene of the crime . Okay . Uh , Dirty Willy bought it right about here ... and I saw the killer standing right over there . Hey , funny face , this area 's off limits , all right ? I got top-notch talent makin their way through here ... to the most glorious stage in Las Vegas ... and I can 't have you or that thing you call a suit in the way . Let me explain . - No . There 's no explainin ' that , and who the hell are you ? My name is Dick Dixon . - You 're Dick Dixon ? Oh ! - You slept with my wife , you scumball ! I don 't even know your wife . - Thrifty Suites , number 38 . Ring a bell , pumpkin ? Hey , hey , hey , half-pint , this ain 't about your old lady givin' room service , all right ? We 're tryin ' to find Mona Jeffries . - Yeah , well , I ain 't seen her . What are you gonna do about it , tough guy ? You see that ? There goes my Chivas . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? - I ran a dojo once . Now tell us what you know . - Okay . I 'll tell you what I told the cops , all right ? Mona ain 't your typical showgirl , all right ? She - She won 't show her cones , and she saves her dough . She bought a condo outside of town . - Where ? Okay ! God ! I 'll tell ya ! Geez ! I got your back , J-Man . - Oh , that 's very comforting . Either my Mona 's real messy , J-Man , or somethin ' real bad happened to her . You can stop right there . Let 's see some I. D. The I. D. ' s out in the car . My name is Dick Dixon . - You 're Dick Dixon ? Yes . - You slept with one of our deputies . She left the force ' cause of you . I seem to have that effect on people . What happened here ? - Been a while since you cracked your detective handbook , huh ? We got a report of a disturbance . Door was jimmied , place had been trashed ... but her car keys , purse and valuables are still here . Mona was leaving ? - No . She was kidnapped . You gonna get that ? Those are the late-night creepers . It is the honeymoon suite . Oh , yeah . Thank you very much . Oh , Syd . You 're here early . - I thought something was wrong . Oh , no . No . No . As a matter of fact , Things are gonna be different from now on . Broots , you are gonna pay for ... using all the hot water , you moron ! You were saying , Broots ? Syd , please tell me you 're here to relieve me . Being cooped up with Felix Ungar here makes me glad to see your sorry mug . Lyle and I are registered at Caesars . Separate rooms ? Well , separate suites . Lyle will be here later . Perhaps we can take over . Hopefully , I won 't have plugged Broots before then . Call me when he gets here . What ? - I thought things were gonna be different between us . There is no " us . " At least ... not that they know of . Could you imagine what they would do if they knew ? Right . Right . We don 't-We don 't wanna give them any ammunition , now do we ? Speaking of which ... my clip is empty . Oh , yeah . I get it , baby . But if we 're gonna do this - we gotta do it right . I 've always had a little fantasy I want to live out with you . But first I want you to call me ... " Puff Daddy . " Say it . Say it . Puff ... - Daddy . Oh ! They say that life is stranger than fiction . Mine certainly has been , and this was no exception . Mona was kidnapped , but by whom ? Whatever trouble her boss , Dirty Willy , found , it had certainly found her ... and it was only a matter of time before it found us . I did what Syndey always taught me : When in doubt , go back to the evidence . A couple of things just don 't make any sense . According to the autopsy report ... what killed Dirty Willy was low levels of oxygen in his tissues ... due to hypothermia-extreme cold . He froze to death . In Vegas ? And he had several ice pick holes in his hands . I 'm thinkin ' torture . Wait a second , J-Man . You don 't think who 's ever doin ' this might , you know ... poke Mona like that ? - Let 's hope not . According to this file , he is the number one suspect : Constantin Falzone - an extortionist for the Posavac crime family . What other part of your two-plus-two case don 't add up to four ? Dirty Willy weighed over 300 pounds . Frozen or not , that 's a lot of Willy for one man to carry around . Wait . What are you sayin ' , " J " ? - There were two killers ... who tortured Dirty Willy and froze him to death . Question is , what did they want out of him ? That 's easy , baby-cash , do-re-mi , J-Man . Everybody knows Falzone collects around town ... so maybe Dirty Willy couldn 't come up with the green ... and the twins get P. O. ' d with him . Twins ? - Falzone 's got these Frigidaires that work for him . Calls ' em his caddies . - Caddies ? Why ? Falzone-Sin City old-timer . Doesn 't care about shopping malls , pirate ships or the Eiffel Tower in the desert . He 's only interested in cash ... and a three handicap . J-Rod , those two goons killed Dirty Willy and kidnapped my Mona . I say we waste ' em and snag Falzone . No . We meet Falzone out there on his own turf . But you don 't know how to play . It 's all geometry and physics . How hard could that be ? Sydney always taught me , the most difficult Pretends have an inner secret . Once you reveal that secret , it comes naturally . In 56 minutes , I found the secret to a perfect golf game . I 'll share it with you sometime . The twins were impressed , just like I said . Falzone wanted to take me on . Then I told them I was Dick Dixon . Guess which one 's married . The twins promised to get us to Falzone , which they did . However , in true Chandleresque fashion , we found out it was with a twist . Someone else had gotten to him first . And to think I wasted 56 minutes . Raymond Chandler always said , " The best way to get a reader 's attention is with a dead body . " But of course , Chandler wasn 't writing this one . I got balls ! I got balls . Unbe-friggin-lievable . People actually throw these away . And that makes them yours . - Possession is 9 / 10ths . You oughta know . I hear Dick Dixon steals wives . And I hear you hang Dirty Willys . And now you 've kidnapped Mona Jeffries . How come I get the feeling you cheat at golf ? If you 're not cheating , you 're not playing . Hey , we want Mona back . - Who are you-Little Dick ? All right . I 'll show you little , ya big freak . Hey . Dirty Willy never came up short , so there 's no reason to kill him . As for Mona , a Viagra-poppin' man such as myself ... can only pray to enjoy a muffin like that in the morning . All right . That 's it . You and me gonna throw right now , paisan . I had it with this mook . Hey . I got no beef with Dirty Willy . I got no beef with you , Dixon . Mona asked me for help . She said that Dirty Willy was gettin 's queezed ... by , um , a couple of goons by the name of the Frost Brothers . The Frost Brothers ? - The Frost Brothers . Now I got my finger in every casino in this whole town . I never heard of these guys . Okay ? So that 's it . That 's all I know . All right ? Are we done ? Are we done ? Let 's go . - Let 's go . Give me my balls . Room service . I was just talkin ' to the manager . You won 't believe what he was telling me . And what would that be , Mr. Broots ? - Glad you could join us . Centre employees of opposite genders don 't room together . Just show him . Taken by a security camera at McCarran International Airport . It 's of Jarod heading for the runway . He skipped town . Your theory isn 't holding . It 's time to go home . No , but the-the e-mail said that he was gonna be here . W-We have to stay . Broots , it 's over . - No . I just talked to the manager . He took a reservation last night under the name of " Jarod Siegel " - as in " Bugsy Siegel , " the man who created Vegas . A reservation doesn 't mean he 's gonna show . We 're leaving . - We 're staying . Did he just ignore us ? You wanna barge in here and try and scare me ? You go ahead . But don 't question my skills . I 'm not second string anymore . I do a job , and I do it well . And if your paranoid minds can 't take that , then you can go chase that photo . Miss Parker and I will catch Jarod . Enjoy your breakfast . You better hope we catch Jarod , or we 're through . You mean us ? - I mean our necks . As Argyle and I drove back to Benny 's ... we knew that without the mysterious Frost Brothers , there was no Mona ... and no dream for Argyle . But Argyle ' s dream wasn 't the only one in jeopardy . Oh , those bastards . Bastards , all of them ! - Benny , what happened ? There I am . I am standing there in the bunker . I am halfway into my " overature , " and they grab me . Wayne 's bodyguards . - Oh , bite your tongue . Wayne 's people ... would never do that with a rake . Ah , it was those lowlifes that work for the other half of Wayne 's threesome - those " mugicians " with the big hair ? It 's a good thing they didn 't bring their tigers , boy . Whew . - So Wayne never heard your song ? No . And I know he would 've loved it . He would 've loved it . Of course he would have . What 's the matter with him ? - We haven 't found Mona yet . Oh , boy . Oh , boy . It 's always a girl , isn 't it ? Let me let you in on a little tiny secret . He 's just exactly like me . No . - Oh , yes . I was wild . I was unchecked ... until my Adella tamed me . I still remember that trip to Vegas . We wanted to get away from it all . Dr. Kanapa had told us that we wouldn 't be able to have a family ... and I know it was really tough for her . But my Adella - God , she looked so beautiful the night we went to see Wayne . Ya never saw a polka dot dress like that in your life . Well , big Wayne - he picks her out of the whole crowd ... and he sang " Danke Schoen " right to her . It was ... - Like a dream . Yeah . That night , Adella came back to the motor court ... all giddy from Wayne 's show , you know ? And we drove the cattle across the prairie all night long , if you catch my meaning ... and ... we were blessed . You conceived Argyle . - Rolled a hard eight . So now , when I see him goin ' through all this - I think , " Where would I be today if it weren 't for my Adella ? " She was your Mona . Jarod ... ya gotta find that girl for my boy . It seems everybody who met Mona wanted her : Argyle , her brother , Falzone . It got my detective gears spinning . Look , buddy boy . I followed her home once-okay , twice . Nick had known everything about Mona : where she lived , how she saved her money . Maybe he knew who the Frost Brothers were . But I swear , I never heard of the Frost Brothers . - It was almost a dead end . Almost . - Dixon . Deputy Wyatt hadn 't punched me the first time we met . Guess he figured I was due . Oh , this is gettin really old . - You tryin to destroy three months of real police work ? We almost got Falzone for extortion . - So get him . After you talked to him ? You of all people should know ... there 's only one way to do things in this town : the Vegas way . What about the Frost Brothers way ? What 's that place got to do with anything ? - Place ? Place ? - Place ? Place . It 's an abandoned meat-packing plant outside town . So what ? Mona ? Mona ? Mona ? Mona ! Mona ! Mona . - I didn 't think you 'd come . Oh , you 're so cold . L-Let 's get you out of here . - Argyle , these two guys - They had masks on . They grabbed me . They 've been trying to get me to tell them what Dirty Willy told me . But I can 't tell them that secret , 'cause I can 't do that to Willy . Well , you could tel I us the secret , Mona . - Tell us later . We have to get out of here right now . Yeah . We need to get you back to your brother . Brother ? I don 't have a brother . Sure you do . Two of 'em . Argyle , say hello to the Frost Brothers . It was a case to make Ray Chandler proud . Let 's review . Our two sheriff deputies , Wyatt and Mike ... they killed Dirty Willy - tortured him , froze him , hung him . But what did they want out of him ? Money ? Do-re-mi ? You won 't be surprised if I tell you the answer is no . Dirty Willy had one dirty little secret left ... and these guys were trying to get it out of Mona ... and us . It 's been eight hours . Start talking . - I got nothin ' to say . You just don 't get it , do you , Dixon ? We do things the Vegas way . Now , Mona 's brother here is gonna drive her into the desert . If he doesn 't hear from me in 30 , she 's gone , and I ice the two of you . Oh , and I keep the dog . Don 't give ' em anything , Argyle . Not one quarter ! Ah , put a sock in it , Dog . That was a strange thing to say . Yeah , right - especially since dogs don 't wear socks . Not Dog . Mona . She said , " not a quarter . " " Don 't give them one quarter . " Well , J-Man , Mona left a bucket full of quarters in Dick Dixon 's office . Dirty Willy 's secret . Whatever he was tryin to protect must have been in that bucket . Wyatt ! - Hey , what the hell are you doin ' ? I 'm gonna give him what he wants . Wyatt ! There it is . Look , Willy . If you pay us what we need ... we won 't need to get rough with you . Falzone wasn 't extorting money from Willy and his club . You were . And the dirty fat boy recorded me doin ' it . All the time you just wanted that tape , it was right there . - Nice work , detectives . Willy was just tryin ' to get that tape to Dick Dixon . So now you got it . Call your deputy and let Mona go . Poor Willy didn 't even know that Dick Dixon had skipped town . Wait a second . You 're not Dick Dixon ? No . Loser . Oh , hi , there . Let me outta this . - Uh-uh . You know , you should be protecting people - not extorting from them . But I guess that 's what they call the " Vegas way , " right ? Oh , yeah . - Well , we 've already tried that . Let 's try the Jarod way . - No ! No ! No ! You 're totally whacked . - You don 't know the half of it . You 're going to make a call . You 're going to let Mona go . - I don 't think so . Loser . Oh . Ooh , that 's harder than golf . You 're outta your mind . - Make the call . No . - Uh , loser . Last chance . Loser . - Okay . Fore ! - Wyatt finally made the call . And so did I-to the F .. B. I. When they arrived at the office , they found a killer waiting for them ... along with the evidence to convict him - all courtesy of the mysterious Richard W. Dixon . But the story isn 't over . I still have one more job to do . Anything ? Nothing . Which is what we 're gonna be when we get back to the Centre . It was fun while it lasted - Puff Daddy . Miss - Hoo . I guess I 'm not a scrub anymore . I hope you like Renewal Wing , ' cause I 'm gettin ' you a gift certificate . The Centre reeducators can wipe this entire weekend from your brain . Well , you better tell them that Broots caught me . Don 't have to . We 're a team , aren 't we ... Dr. Funkenstein ? Well , that all depends on one thing , baby . Am I your Puff Daddy ? Oh , yeah , baby . And I wanna get funked up . Oh , I have to watch ? You get to watch . I 'll tell you what , Mr. Funkadelic . If we 're gonna do this , let 's do it right . It 's my turn to live out a fantasy . Bald men have always driven me crazy . And it takes more than one to really satisfy me . Mr. Wiggles , get in here ! No . Miss Parker , what about us ? No . No . No . No ! What the-Ah ! Mr. Wiggles . Ow . I told you not to fall asleep . I was asleep ? - Yeah . The whole time ? - Yes , Rip Van Winkle . You were makin ' some weird noises too . And by the way , what exactly is a " Puff Daddy " ? Like I said , I have one more thing to do . But it isn 't this ... dream . It 's somebody else 's . Can I help you with that ? - Why , I - Oh , God . Oh , God . If you knew , sir , how much I 've wanted to meet-This is an honor , sir . This is an honor . - Listen . Third row , polka dot dress . Sir ? - Adella . She was wearin ' a polka dot dress . - You are a god . Listen . I understand there 's something you 'd like me to hear . Well , as a matter of fact , uh , you probably wouldn 't wanna - You know - - I 'd love to . You would ? - I would . Yeah ? Okay . Here we go . # AufWiedersehen , baby # # AufWiedersehen # # It means good-bye , my baby # # I don 't know why I feel this pain # # It 's not my goiter # # But let 's reconnoiter # # So even though I 'm on that far-off desert in Morocco # - # I 'm feelin ' rocko , but I wanna do this refrain # # AufWiedersehen # Whoo ! Well , that was unmistakably you . That 's just the first verse . There 's more to come . - I cannot wait . Uh , listen . I wanna see you all tonight at my show . You 'll be my guest . I 'll leave your names at the front door . And by the way , I want you to know that Adella was my inspiration too . Oh , thank you , sir . Thank you . - See you . See you tonight . What a guy . Thank you . - My pleasure . That could be the worst song I 've ever heard . I know . But to him it was a dream come true . Guess they mean a lot to you , huh ? He listened . He liked it . - Standing room only , Pop . Speaking of a lot , thank you for that donation . It was for a good cause . You know , I don 't think I ever got your name . Well , everyone in town calls me Dick Dixon . You 're Dick Dixon ? - Yes .

 These things have booby traps . Booby . Will do . And it 's a good thing I have my trusty penknife . Dean , those are nail clippers . Got it ! It 's treasure ! Brownish chunks of pirate booty ! Hank , that 's an old piece of candy . Booty ! And there 's a little guy in there made out of pipe-cleaners . Aw , cool . I get that ! It 's all macaroni and empty spools and puffy paint , some yarn ... Felt scraps . Hey ! Packages of googly-eyes ! I 'm totally taking these . Hey , this is interesting . It 's in Sanskrit . And a dialect I 'm not familiar with . I 'm not sure I can read it . Well , just try . " It ... we have to you likely the opening now of this chest . " To all that protect mine rainy-day craft box ... are cursed , when to not take away ... " things or objects ... " or something like that . The prepositions and stuff are all screwy ... It 's a cursed treasure ! The boys are in trouble . You have thieved from the sacred craft-bin of Olee Janeema . Give him back the googly-eyes ! - You ! - I didn 't take ' em ! Now your blood shall flow in his name ... My arm came off . I can 't believe that happened ! Out of the way , boys . I 'm gonna give him something to really cry about . Aw , I wanted a piece of him . Stop ! Oh , I 'm sorry . Stop hitting yourself ! Ooh , the terrible hurting ! Ow ! Please stop doing that . Enough ! The Monarch ! While you were wasting your time castrating a priceless antique ... I have been systematically feeding babies ... to hungry , mutated puppies ! Not likely , Monarch . Silence ! You know what this means . Mecha-shiva . Mecha-shiva go ! Oh , no ! Wait a minute ! That 's insane ! They 're total liars ! I kept my mouth shut when Dean said he could read Sanskrit . Then , when Hank said he wanted a piece of him ... I was , like , fine . Whatever . But Mecha-shiva ? No way ! They are so lying . I 'm innocent . And now , Mr. Monarch , you 'll have your chance . Order ! Order ! I will have order ! Mecha-shiva ! Excuse me , gentlemen . Would this be the courtroom ... where one might attend " The People v. The Monarch " ? You got the right room , but no one goes through these doors without clearance . I 'm sure you 'll find that I have every right to attend these proceedings . I 'm in , and I 've made a bit of a mess . Send a cleaner for 375 pounds . Maybe more . - So , Hank ... it is Hank , isn 't it ? - Yes , sir . Well , Hank , what 's it like to be a ... liar ? Do you like being a liar , with pants constantly on fire ? Objection , your honor ! Leading . I 'll rephrase that . Hank , are you a liar ? No , sir . I don 't think so . - Yes , you are ! - You 're the liar ! And may I remind you that I am rubber and you are glue ... and whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you ! That 's it ! This court will recess for one hour . I want to see the attorneys in my chamber now ! You 're on thin ice here , but do you get off the ice ? Hell , no ! You jump up and down like a lunatic having a conniption fit . Now , if it was up to me , you 'd have been in chains an hour ago . But this is a trial by jury , and it 's up to your peers ... Peers ? Peers ! How dare you ! That repulsive display of humanity out there ? No way ! Oh , look , freak-show decided to show up . Would you be so kind as to liberate me from my fetters ? It is a powerful hot in here . Your Honor , I have some experience ... with these what you might call super villain-types . They 're a specialty of mine . What with this condition I 'm sorely afflicted with . What ? You have a condition ? No . No way . Most of them are wilder than a peach orchard hog . But this one here will go down like all the others . Yessir , that 's a promise . I 'm gonna be working harder than a cat trying to bury a turd on a marble floor . Now , that 's appealing . I don 't even have to open it . I can just tell ... egg salad . Fart-sandwiches . Dean , hold your breath . We 're going in for the cookie . T-minus three , two , one . If I knew you could just call the cops on him ... I would have done it years ago ! Because I 'm no sissy . No , sir . I would just pick up that phone and , " Officer , there 's a man in a butterfly suit ... " shooting my robot with a laser beam . " We 'd still be waiting for the cops to show up . The police stay out of the way of the Guild for the most part . Who do you think supplied the department with new cruisers last year ? My tax dollars , for one . Santa Claus , for two . Keep dreamin ' . No cop would respond to a call like that . What about a supercop with a jet pack and a devil-may-care attitude ? The only way the police would get involved is ... if the Guild screwed with them first . So when the Monarch messed with the police ... - he messed with ... - The Guild . I was gonna say that . Sovereign ... Many of our operatives are in place . We await your orders . Good . Good . Let us proceed to stage five . It shall be done . Great , way to make me look like a tool ! What are you doing back there ? Have you seen my juice-box ? Oh , that was yours ? - I thought that ... - Great . Thanks . Why did I even bother putting my initials on it ? How rude of me . Would you care for some Pez ? Oh ... no . I think they taste too much like soap . For my next witness , I would like to call to the stand ... The Monarch ! They are so gonna fry this idiot . Just get on the stand and give your testimony . Oh . OK . Right . Sorry . How do I , uh ? Oh , any time , Mr. Monarch . Today would be nice . OK , I should just go then ? Please ! This all started soon after " The Flight of the Monarch " was published ... a mean little tell-all book filled with nothing but lies and pictures of also-lies . - What the hell is this ? - A book ? No ! But you would think it was , right ? You can read it like a book . Here , I 'll show you . " Rifling through his pockets for change , the Monarch accidentally launches ... " a sodium-pentothal-tipped dart deep into his own thigh . " Upon hearing a girlish symphony of shrill walls ... " a waitress comes to his aid ... " I told you . You told me he wouldn 't find out . You 're such a dick . You put his face on the cover ! " ... plucking your eyebrows ? ! " Oh , it 's almost exactly like a book . There 's even some pictures . Why , here 's one of me at Dance-eteria ... making out with Stiv Bators and Lydia Lunch ! But this is not a book . This is a suicide note ! Good news ! The euthanasia will be carried out by me . The author has twenty minutes to seek my aid before I just kill all of you . You 'll find me in my room ... crying . After a heart-to-heart with my family of friends ... a confession soon followed . It must have been hard for him to come to a man he saw as a mentor ... and confess to penning such libelous slander . I was lenient on him . He punished himself enough . You should have replaced his blood with acid after this part . The sharks won 't touch him now . Thanks , Dr. Girlfriend . Now you tell me . Lower the giant hair dryer ! Objection ! On what grounds ? Boring me to tears . Ha ! Relevance , Your Honor . Mr. Monarch hasn 't been charged with having a book written about him . He 's been charged with the abduction or maybe , well ... disintegration of a police officer . I 'm getting to that ! Just keep your pants on . Oh , wait . You can 't wear pants , can you ? Overruled . Continue , Mr. Monarch . But please get to the point . But sadly , the repercussions of " The Flight of the Monarch " ... were far from over . OK , then who haven 't you slept with ? I 'm sure that 's a shorter list . Oh , you are insane ! I 'm insane ? I 'm insane ? Look at these ! There 's a picture of you in Monstroso 's lap . That was a party . Look at his lap ... it 's huge . There 's , like , five of us on it . Yeah , right . And here 's one of you skinny dipping with Jim Foetus ! Let me see that . I don 't remember ... And there 's a whole collage of you and Phantom Limb . All right , fine ! I used to work for him . So what ? Holy crap ! Look at your costume ! What , did Frank Frazetta design it for you ? It 's tiny ! I can see your dirty pillows ! I am leaving ! If you can 't calm down , I 'm leaving . You can 't leave . I 'm throwing you out . Get out of my cocoon , you whore ! After an amicable parting of the ways , life went on as usual . And that was the last time I saw Dr. Girl ... Dr. Ex-Girlfriend ! Good riddance to bad girlfriends , I say . My guess is about then , well , she was so sad about her failure to upset me ... that she probably went crazy , rampage nuts . He 's lying ! Oh , no way . That 's a real big surprise . Good gracious . What happened to you ? It 's a long story . Can I come in ? Of course , of course . It 's horrid out there . I insist on it . Dear girl , you 're soaked to the bone . Come sit down and tell me all about it . Now , let it all out . I 'm just going to get you some dry clothes . He threw me out . After saying the most horrible things , he threw me out . The cad ! How dare he ! Who does he think he is ... Mr. King Butterfly Man ? Well , I 'm nobody 's doormat . Before I met him , I was Lady Au Pair . I was feared , and I was respected , and not just by my murderous moppets ... by everyone . And after that , I was ... Queen Etherea . Put it on . I want to see you in it again . Oh , I can 't believe you saved it . What are these hard chunks ? My tears . Tears ? You have to be kidding me ! You know that sick , deformed slob ... you know he was pounding his invisible meat ... That 's it . Objection ! Your honor , I have children listening to this potty talk ! Sustained . I want that last bit stricken from the record ... and my mind . Dr. Venture , you might want to take your sons out . Not me ! There 's no way I 'm gonna miss this . Brock , be a lamb , and take the boys somewhere . Aw , come on , Pop . We 're not babies . Dean told me how he pounds his ... All right . Yeah , boys . Uh , hey , why don 't we go scrounge up some adventure ... do some , uh ... Control , delay order . We 've lost full containment . I repeat , delay order . Copy on delay . - We are on standby . - Knew it . I thought you went to the can . I did . I 'm back . That was , like , ten seconds ago . What , are you pissing in the corner ? There 's gum in this fountain ... our first clue . It seems our thirsty mystery man was a gum-chewer . Look , Brock . Hank found a clue . Oh , great . Boys , don 't touch that clue . That clue was in somebody 's mouth . That clue 's filthy . Now , take your time . I know this is very upsetting for you . Would you like a tissue ? It 's fine . I have one . If this is too much for you ... No , please . I want to finish . Go on , then . I was there for maybe a half an hour . We were eating some aged ... something-or-other cheese . I don 't recall what it was . Asiago . I developed a love for this playful provision ... during my stay in Florence , Italy . It 's really nothing more than a common table cheese ... but I find it a charming yang to merlot 's impish ying . It tastes like the inside of an old thermos . Will you knock that off ? Let me get that . You must be strong . Remember who you are . His lies can 't hurt you anymore . Stop that . We heard you the first time . I knew you were here ! The henchmen were all , " She went to her mother 's " ... but I knew you went crawling back to him ! Keep your voice down . Holy crap ! What are you wearing ? Is that your Queen Etherea suit ? You 're wearing your old costume now ? My clothes were wet , and he ... I can 't believe you 're falling for that floating ... smooth-talking jackass ! I can 't even look at you in that ... slut ... slut slutty slut suit ! I was wearing this when you first met me . I don 't remember you complaining then . That 's because I had you out of that rag ... within the first five minutes of meeting you . I made you the Monarch 's ! You are a monster ! All right . That was supposed to be romantic . Oh , go to hell ! Fine ! Then he just hung around the yard yelling till somebody called the cops . That was all you saw ? Well , I saw the flashing lights from , I guess , the police ... and I heard some talking . Then ... - Then ? - Then ... nothing . Ow ! What the dealy-o ? Saliva is nature 's glue . And raisins are nature 's candy ! It 's the oldest trick in the book . If I place a hair between the door and frame ... - We 've been made . - It works as a burglar alarm . All we have to do is come back , and if the hair is gone ... somebody used this door . Help ! Do not be too hasty entering that room . I had Taco Bell for lunch ! Expert witness Dr. Byron Orpheus has arrived ! The hair 's gone ! A clue ! It was Dr. O. The whole time . I wonder what that means . It means Dr. Orpheus had to take a dump . So , nice job . Case closed . Place your right hand on the ... How sweet . A Bible . Well , if you don 't mind , sir , I have a book of my own for this little ritual . Keep your fingers clear of its mouth . He 's a nibbler . Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ... and nothing but the truth , so help you ... uh , whoever ? I swear it . Dr. Orpheus , could you tell the court what it is that you do ? You 're a type of magician ? Oh , they have no idea what they 're in for . Well , if you must call me that , yes . But if you are after mere parlor tricks ... you will be sorely disappointed . For if I reach behind your ear , it will not be a nickel I pull out ... but your very soul ! Good night , ladies and gentlemen . You 've been a great crowd . A mind reader , huh ? That seems kind of hocus-pocus , now , don 't it ? It 's as crazy as ... oh , let 's say the fact ... that nobody can recall what happened that night ... the night that a policeman and his motorcycle simply vanished . Well , maybe I 'm just an ignorant old country lawyer ... but this sounds like a cover-up . Or is it magic ? Do you believe in magic ? The Monarch must , for he 's given us no other rational explanation . Something big is going down . This place is crawling with Strangers . You can 't expect to know everybody . No , Hank . Strangers are undercover Guild operatives . We gotta warn Pop ! No , Dean . This is Guild business . Your father isn 't in any harm . The Guild works clean , professional . It 's surgical with them . In a way , they 're the only organization I still respect . And they kill clean . Don 't let dames get in the way . Honestly , Hank , where do you pick that stuff up ? I never see you read . It 's weird , right ? It 's like he channels dead crazy people . You think it 's a cry for help ? So ... a mind reader . Fascinating . Could you read the mind of , let 's say , for instance , the Monarch ? If it would please the court . Objection . No way ! This is most unorthodox . Unorthodox ? The defendant 's in a crown , for God 's sake ! I myself am growing from the torso of an inbred simpleton . I promise not to make his eyes boil . I 'll ... allow it . Hug me . Fine . Whatever gets you off , man . Just don 't go for the reach-around ... because the Monarch doesn 't swing that ... Sleep ! Dream . All right , what 's going on here ? Oh , just doing some ... gardening . I got a call from a concerned citizen there 's a domestic going on here . Listen , Officer Poncharello , my second-in-command just left me . So why don 't you put your fat Tom-of-Finland ass ... back on your big gay bike and go home ? This is none of your beeswax . OK , pal , let 's just keep those hands where I can see them . Oh , you want some of this ? Let 's go , Fonzie . Come on . Take your best shot ! Think you can take this ? So , too fast for you ? It 's all there . Do you want to count it ? No . That 's bad form . There 's a passport , name change information , the works . Even got you a new wife . You won 't see her much , being a supermodel . She 'll be traveling a lot . Uh , do I have an erection ? I feel like I might have one . Pleasure doing business with you , gentlemen . If we see you , hear your voice in a crowd ... Don 't worry about me . I 'm a ghost . Good . We 'll take it from here . You won 't believe this . I 've seen the greasy interior of many a mind ... and I 'm not sure I believe this . Now ! It must be now ! Now ! - What 'd I miss ? - Now ! It 's a Freeze-Team ! Down on the ground and hold your breath . There 's pee pee on the floor ! I told you to hold your breath . Take the prisoner . For everyone else , I want a level three memory wipe . Move ! Finally , number three on the Guild 's most wanted list ... Tiny Attorney . It 's time the Guild sentences him to a " Trial Separation . " Ha ! I just made that up . It 's funny on a lot of levels . Right . It just came out . What about the necromancer ? Memory wipes don 't work on his kind . True , but they take to hypnotic suggestion like cancer to a prostate . Wait ! I know this one . Filed with us five times to get an arch-rival ... part of the Venture clique , I think . You know the Monarch did it . He 's a very bad man who wants to hurt the Venture family ... and once he 's put away ... we 'll get all of you a new arch-rival , just like you 've always wanted . You 're gonna put the Monarch away ? You never told me that . Somebody has to take the fall . But you , my dear , you were perfect , a regular Mata Hari . Trust me . The Guild will reward you handsomely . But as for your precious Monarch , forget him . He 's totally screwed . Will that hypnotic suggestion thing work on him ? I think so . I had nothing to do with this crap . It was , like , I don 't know , those weird kids , the Venture brothers . They did it . Strangers , withdraw ! All clear , Mr. Samson . The Guild appreciates your non-interference . Whatever . How much time ? Twenty seconds . Continue , Mr. Orpheus . You were saying ? I hope they find me a girl villain . - Mr. Orpheus ? - A redhead . He 's gonna blow it . Brock , when did you get back ? What happened to the little guy riding the retard ? Don 't worry about it . Mr. Orpheus , you were telling us what you learned . That is true , I was . With my own eyes , I have seen into his senses . I have been a witness to his doings ! And I have found that the Monarch is ... without any shadow of a doubt ... guilty ! Oh , my precious pookums , of course I forgive you . Why , in a few , oh , I don 't know , decades ... I 'll be out of here , And we can ... we can just start again . Can I go now ? Everybody 's staring at me . That 's good soup !

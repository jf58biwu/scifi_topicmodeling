 Oblongs , Oblongs Down in the valley where a chemical spill Came from the people living up on the Hill There 's a family by the landfill with hazardous foam In their happy glowing home Oblongs Another Dump Day . - l 'm scared , George . - There , there , dear . The sanitation trucks are on their way . I want our oversized refuse buried in a landfill . I don 't want anyone to actually use it . I just can 't help but wonder what kind of filthy , bottom-feeding vermin would pilfer another man 's garbage . - Happy Dump Day ! - Happy Dump Day , sweetheart . When I lived in the hills , I threw away my trash . Now that same trash is my bounty . Funny , isn 't it ? Does it worry anyone that I can 't stop laughing ? Mom ! Dad ! I 'm so excited , I 've been hopping all night . You might wanna switch feet there , Milo . That one 's pretty swollen . No can do , Pop . Right one 's for Christmas . Left one , Dump Day . Well , why don 't you put that energy to good use ... - ... and go get Biff and Chip . - The sooner we get to the hills the sooner we can get our hands on some fine , large garbage . Where do you think you 're going , ass-breath ? Yeah , ass-breath , because his breath smells like ass . Trespassing requires- - - Punishment . - You read my mind . - l always- - - Do . Can we get this over with ? Because it 's Dump Day , and I 've got a lot on my plate . - Mega-wedgy ! - Mega-wedgy ! They 'll be right down . Dear Lord , thank you for this bountiful blessing of rich people 's crap . Now , let 's go refurnish the house ! Look , Milo , I found a retainer . It fits , too . What , I am not allowed to have a little fun ? Give me that ! I 'll show you how a Hula-Hoop is supposed to be used . I found a cute new belt . I cut my bottom on a rusty nail . When did you have your last tetanus shot ? I don 't think I 've ever ha- - Mommy can 't live with that racket . Honey , say hello to our new gargoyle . - Why do we need a gargoyle ? - lt 's supposed to ward off evil spirits . Lord knows we don 't want misfortune to befall our perfect little family . Hey , Mom , I found a spear gun . Can we go to SeaWorld ? Milo , be careful . That thing is loaded . Guess Mommy is too . Hi there . We were hoping some cute boys would come along and take us for an expensive meal we could just pick at . - They 're totally flirting with us . - Just ignore them . We came here to find a Pec Blaster so we can make our nipples dance . Who cares about our nipples ? I 'm interested in their nipples . Chip , life isn 't just about partying . It 's about setting goals and achieving them . Then showering with the team and snapping each other 's butts with towels . It doesn 't matter anyway. lt 's not like we have any money for a date . Dude , check it out ! It 's a " hundsky " ! - Hey , it 's over here . - No , it 's over here . I don 't know what you 're looking at . Hey , Doublemint dorks . Walk much ? Like we 'd ever go out with total losers like them . This was the greatest Dump Day ever . What did you two boys get ? - Humiliated . - Everybody thinks we 're losers . Let me tell you something , boys . Real losers are the ones who call you losers . In addition , of course , to the aforementioned original losers who in this case would be ... . - Why don 't you give me a hand here . - Jesus . Oh , come on , you pouty Petes . Help me rip the newspaper off this gargoyle . I can 't afford another paper cut on my soft palate . Hey , what 's this ? " Feel like a loser ? Before you try suicide , triathlon . The Hill Valley Two-Man Triathlon . " We gotta do this . Yeah , yeah , I know . Goals , achievement , towels . " Test your manhood against last year 's winners Jared Klimer and his obnoxious friend Blaine . " Those buttbags ? Count me in ! - We gotta start training now . - But I wanna go lie in the bathroom ... - ... and eat Hot Pockets . - Chip . All right , all right . Let 's do it . - l 'm down . - What are you doing ? Because I 'm doing- - - You wanna go for a run ? - Running 's good . Ready , set fire ! That 's an owie ! My turn . You can break my spine , but not my spirit . - My turn . - No way. I didn 't go yet . There 's a little law called gravity that might have something to say about that . Oh , crap . That 's Biff and Chip 's room . - l can 't go in there . - They 're out sprinting . I saw them all sweaty in their spandex . " Ran laps behind coach at practice . I hope someday to have his perfect buttocks . " " Came in early today . Coach was alone in the Jacuzzi- - " Boring . Looks like someone just ordered a knuckle sandwich . With a side of noogies . - Let 's do stuff to him . - Yeah , stuff . This should do the trick . - You okay ? - Yeah . - Me too . - Oh , my God ! Dad , Milo 's glued to our back ! What do we do ? Actually , I need your advice . Should I go towards the bright light or away from it ? Well , unfortunately , the glue went through to your skin . And it says here it 's permanent . Are you saying I 'll be joined to another person for the rest of my life ? - We 'll be freaks ! - Now , we just have to look at the positives . First of all , there is safety in numbers . Well , I 'm tapped . Wait , I 've got it . No , it was just a salami burp . I 've drawn up a five-year plan ... Follow this and your lives should continue pretty much as usual only a third less fulfilling . According to this decision tree you guys have to do what I want till 0600 tomorrow . But we have to train for the triathlon . Biff , will you stop setting goals ? I got a hyperactive elf breathing halitosis in my ear . You 're one to talk , Mr. Zit-Neck . Milo , stop talking about how ugly Chip is . And , Chip , leave Milo 's rancid breath out of this . I won 't have these insults in my house . Besides , a true competitor can overcome any adversity . - Just look at Lou Gehrig . - He died . I know , but just look at him . - l see what you mean . - l have to go to the bathroom . In that case , I 'm going into a trance . Mommy , what 's a trance ? Something your brothers do to give each other privacy . I really have to go ! Number one or number two ? - A little of both . - Good night , folks . This pressure 's not helping . Okay , the first order of business is to pick a new name for our club on account of some of us can 't pronounce the word Algonquin . I propose we call ourselves the Knights of Backyardia . I have a better one . How about the Lame-Ass Stupid Baby Club ? - Yeah , I second it . - Yeah . I third it . Hey , did you guys know there 's a ginormous tree toad in here ? I love you . I Frenched Milo ! Good night , my little shmuzzle-wuzzle pookie-wookie . Pickles , do you think it queer that there 's smoke rising from under her covers ? Now , Bob , according to Dr. Spock if you worry about every little thing we could give her a complex . It 's a lot of smoke . We 're all joined in a clump . Where do they get this stuff ? Precious . Boys , you 're not near ready for this triathlon . Your time in the dash is up from 1 0.8 seconds to 1 : 1 2 . And apparently you 've gained 65 pounds . Look who 's talking , thunder thighs . Now , that 's just cruel . I have struggled with my weight problem for years . Don 't you ever talk to coach like that . Hey ! Behold the ugliest of all sea creatures : The octo-dork . So this chump clump is our competition for the two-man triathlon ? We are gonna smoke you like a spiral-cut ham . Jared , Biff says you 're a wuss-cake . Oh , he does , huh ? Wait , it was Chip who said it . All right , just a couple thousand squat thrusts and we can call it a night . Squat all you want , I have a date . I 'm taking Courtney to the movies . - You wanna beat Blaine and Jared or not ? - Of course I do . But according to Dad 's pie chart , I 'll be reaching my sexual peak at 9 tonight . I 'd like to be near a female other than Mom . Hey , I love Mom . I vote movie . Anything without Steve Buscemi . Sorry , dude . Two to one . I don 't believe this . I am so trancing out . If I were you , I would take this opportunity to vigorously scrub his armpits . Any chance your other brother can go into a trance too ? I doubled my Ritalin just to get this calm . Try to ignore him . Hey , why are you squeezing my booby ? - Are you trying to feel me up ? - No , I was feeling Milo up . There are so many things wrong with that . No , you don 't get it . I was trying to score with you . That 's it. I 'm out of here . Thanks , dillweed. I really liked her . Courtney , my brother 's just nervous because he likes you so much . He says you have a beautiful soul . That changes everything . I think I 'm in love . And it 's all thanks to you , little bro . No problem , big bro . Should we wake up sleeping bro ? We never get to hang out , just the two of us . Hey , that reminds me of a song . - How long was I out ? - l don 't know . Who cares ? Hey , where 'd you get those mugs ? We made them at Next of Kiln . But we were supposed to make bro mugs . Wow , I sure didn 't miss your whining . You know , you could learn a lot from Milo . He knows how to cut loose . Thanks , Chip . Hey , you wanna go to the convenience store and buy some sucking candy ? You are Dr. Funstein . - l 'm fun . - Come on , Milo , let 's ditch him . Pickles , where are my ankle weights ? Gargoyle ! Gargoyle ! Get it off ! Get it off ! Oh , that is so cute . I love to see you two playing . I wanna get my camera . Honey , what were you doing on Daddy 's back ? I wanna be stuck to you . " l want , I want , I want . " When I was your age , I hopped 50 miles to school through the driving snow , always looking over my shoulder for the snow monkeys . I think I have a concussion . Swimming is Blaine and Jared 's strongest event so we gotta practice really , really hard . Chip , you 're not shaved or oiled . And those trunks aren 't aquadynamic . I talked him out of it . Speedos are just a pathetic cry for attention . - Shut up . - Hey , don 't talk to my brother like that Dingus Khan . Dingus Khan ? You know , sometimes words hurt more than a tightly balled fist . I 'm gonna swim it off . Sludge fight ! Eat sewage , dude ! Come on . Quit fooling around . Remember what coach says ? " Pride , sacrifice , desire . " - l desire you to shut up . - Why are you talking like this ? - We used to be a team . - You have a fish on your face . Ever since Milo got stuck to us , I don 't even know you . Hey , at least Milo knows how to have fun . I wouldn 't mind if he was stuck to me for the rest of my life . Hey , guys , look at me ! I 'm a bilge pump ! Milo , you came off . Oh , yeah . Must be all the toxins in the swamp . I think I swallowed a rabbit . I 'm going home . Thank God things can finally get back to normal . Come on , let 's start training . Sludge fight ! You almost got that in my mouth . I could get a canker sore . Sorry . For a minute , I thought you were the fun brother . Hey , I can be fun . In fact , I 'm going to train 24 / 7 / 365 until I 'm the undisputed champion of gaiety . Great . Now I 'm gonna get head hives . Well , that was one of the worst adhesive-related crises this family 's ever faced . But we came through with flying colors . - Hey , Milo , could you pass the- - ? - Salt . You read my mind . - Hey , Biff , could I have the- - ? - Strawberry jam . You know he 's allergic to strawberries . Why don 't you just put a bullet in his head ? - Come on , Chip , we gotta hit the track . - Yeah , yeah . Later , little dude . See you , bro . Milo , now that Biff and Chip are gone , we can be a clump . Okay , one , I don 't understand what you 're saying . Two , you have syrup on your butt . I hope . Bob , I 'm getting worried about Beth . What if that thing on her head is taking over her personality ? Oh , my God ! Chip 's in trouble ! What the- - ? Dude , you saved my life . You 're the best brother ever . Hang on a second . What the hell are you doing ? We finally get that polyp scraped off and you wanna carry him in a Snugli ? When are you gonna accept that our relationship is a reality ... - ... and move on with your life ? - lt 's sad , is what it is . I 've had it . We got a big race tomorrow . Our dignity 's on the line . Either he goes or I go . Fine. I 'll run the race with Milo . What ? But you guys are a team . Not anymore , we 're not . I 'm out of here . Oh , yeah . So you 're saying Beth has been trying to attach herself ... - ... to other members of the family ? - That 's right . Have there been changes in your household ? Well , I did rust-proof the gutters . Why don 't you tell me what 's going on . Slowie says all the boys were stuck together and she felt left out . We 're not talking about the doll . We 're talking about you . But Slowie said she 's talking for Beth . Well , I 've had enough of this foolishness . Doctor , I see what the problem is now . My baby just needs some attention . Excuse me. I think I know a little more about psychology than you do . Biff , this is your last chance . Don 't you wanna be Chip 's partner ? No . You guys are partners now . Wake me when it 's over . Hey , Chipper , looks like you 've got some dead weight there . I 'm used to carrying Biff around . I was referring to the one-eyed , one-haired wonder . Everyone says you two have sex with each other . Ladies and gentlemen , the mayor . Welcome to the annual two-man triathlon . It always gets me pumped to see great athletes competing . Unfortunately , I don 't see any great athletes . Just a bunch of candy-ass nancy boys who couldn 't go round one with the likes of Johnny " The Mayor " Bledsoe ! But I guess weaklings have dreams too . So let the games begin . Yeah ! You did it , Milo ! We won the first event . That 's it . Keep your weight over the seat . Pedal . Pedal ! You 're doing it . You 're doing it . Guess we should have worked on that ahead of time . - You okay , kid ? - The right side of my body feels fine ... - ... but the left side is completely numb . - Welcome to my world . You 're gonna have to finish without me . But where am I gonna find a partner this late in the race ? What ? is it over ? For me it is. I 'm injured . But Chip needs a partner . Yeah , a goof-off like that needs all the help he can get . Hey , he may be a goof-off with a Dorothy Hamill haircut but he has more heart than you ever will . Rah , rah , Biff . " Pride , sacrifice , desire . " You 're a first-string dork . You got the " first-string " part right . Sure , he may be an annoying , anal attaboy , but when he puts his mind to something ... - ... he rocks . - Rock on , Chip . - So you 'll be my- - ? - Partner ? Definitely . Ladies and gentlemen , there has been a slight change in our final event . Because I am bored stiff the 26-mile marathon has been replaced by a 1 00-yard three-legged race . Come on , move it , pussies ! Whoever wins this wins it all . Let 's kick their hill butts . I 'm sorry , man . I should have trained harder . Hey , winning isn 't everything . At least we had fun . Nice try , guys . Hey , what happened to your limp ? Actually , I was faking it . I wanted you to be a team again . You 're okay , little bro . I see why Chip was all up in your stuff . Wait a minute. lt was his fault we lost . - Hey , yeah . Let 's pound him ! - Get him over here . - Maybe we should- - - Stop ? - No , work your kidneys . - Yeah , get in there ! We 'll meet you at the car . Don 't be all day . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

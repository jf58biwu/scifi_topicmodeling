 - Kill . - Quickly , quickly . Come on , we 're almost there ... - Hurry up get across the bridge ! - We 'll cover you . Keep moving , keep moving ! Persistent little buggers . Summerlee ! Arthur ! Summerlee ! No ! Sorry Chalenger , he is gone , let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Ned - Ned ! - Ned just hold still . I 'm just not gonna sit here and watch ; I 've got to do something . No ! Look at that thing it can 't hold us all . Malone ! Ned ! Ned ! No ! NOoooooooooo ! Perfect . - Grab into something ! - Like what ? Anything ! Look We 've got to pull them up . I can 't reach . We can 't they 're too far down . Then we 'll pull up the whole damn bridge . Save your on live , Roxton ! I once promised to follow you to hell and back Challenger Don 't make me a liar . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world ... Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out of the Lost World Find something ? Yeah , Summerlee 's pistol in these rocks . How could they all just disappear ? At least we should have found the bodies . It 's the jungle , anything could happen . It 's not the jungle it 's Tribune and his raiders . Do you really think they have a chance ? We didn 't find any bodies ... the river is quite deep ... if they landed in the middle . You 're not a very good liar . Cavemen ! Behind you ! Now where were we before we were so rudely interrupted ? Let 's go downstream . Of course , it 's the way the bodies would float . What if we 're all alone ? Then I 'll have to take care of you . Challenger will turn this into another experiment ... Summerlee will just be taking notes and Ned ... Is a war corresponded he survived the Great War . Sure they 'll all be fine . What is this thing ? Creeper Vine it tends to stick to what ever it grabs on to . Hurry ! Marguerite , Veronica . Professor Challenger . What the hell are you doing in there ? Oh I should think that 's obvious . I didn 't expect , I mean ... what a sight for sore eyes . Are you all right ? Practically without a scratch . Enough chitchat would you mind setting us free ? Oh yeah I 'm sorry . How did you survive the drop ? It was quite miraculous . First the jungle canopy broke my fall and then that Creeper vine snagged me left me hanging just six foot above the ground . That 's amazing . Oh fortunately someone had set that trap . Someone or something . We found cavemen upriver . Troglodytes , on this part of the plateau ? They may be getting smarter . Smart being the operative word . Isn 't that a fascinating development ? Once I got myself out of the trap I reset it . I never thought I 'd catch anything quite so tasty . George really , eyes are bigger than your stomach . Any sign of the others ? We found Summerlee 's pistol . And Roxton 's hat under the bridge . But no sign of them , or Malone ? - No sign . - Yet . - Ned ! - Malone ! Overgrown pigeon . No don 't shoot you 'll hit him ... I think maybe that 's a chance he 'd like me to take . Are you all right ? All things considered . Oww Oh be quiet and be still . He 's not coming back . Not even for a tidbit as tasty as Malone . Never got a taste of me . Good thing we never would have found you then . It would have spit you out miles away . Oww okay that hurts . It looks ugly but I don 't think it 's too serious . Here 's some Yarrow it helps cuts heal faster . Once we get this cleaned up and a good night 's rest then we can start . No we still got lots of daylight left . Why wait ? You said yourself it 's not serious . There 's not serious and then there 's foolhardy . The longer we wait . The less chance we have of finding Roxton and Summerlee . - If they 're still alive . - Let 's be logical . Logical ? I landed in a Pterodactyl nest . You were saved by the jungle canopy . Figure the odds on that . Well when you put it that way . I suppose , I could be convinced to put my money on Lord John Roxton . Such a pity really I hate to see a good fighting man go to waste . Well that didn 't stop you bombing the bridge and dumping me here in the first place . What 's a lizard to do ? I had a rebellion to put down . You mean a fight with your mercenaries . We 're wasting time you know . What do you want ? Just to be of service ... and your word as a gentleman ... that at sometime in the future you will help me . Help ? To do what ? wipe out another tribe , enslave another people ? Do you really care so little for your life that you can give it up for for honor ? Now there 's a concept I 'm sure you 'll never understand . No wonder you 're species is doomed . You know sometimes ... I question my own generosity . Is it a weakness ? Oh I 'm sure it will be your downfall . The fact remains that you owe me a life . And when the time comes you will repay me ... and that is your weakness . Veronica , no ! Well don 't just stand there help me . Would you tell her , this youthful exuberance is somewhat superfluous . Not her you have to worry about lizard man . Out of the way . He 's all yours . Not so fast I want a piece of this action . Now , now , now children play nice . - John you okay ? - Oh much better now , thank you . Did you miss me ? - Honestly ? - What the hell is he doing here ? Excellent question . Lord Roxton will you please explain my weakness of spirit . What is he talking about ? And tell Marguerite to put that thing away . I can try but you know how she is . You flatter me . I mean can one ever really know a woman . Tribune saved my life . But you seem surprised . Did you think I would hold a grudge ? Get out of here . Just like that . After all we 've meant to each other . I wouldn 't push your luck . You 've done enough harm already . - Seen any sign of Summerlee ? - No . Old , grey hair , decrepit . Arthur Summerlee is a distinguished scientist . As a matter of fact . - What did you see ? - Where ? As I rode out of the jungle ... I happened to see him floating towards the falls . What happened ? Unfortunately I was too late . He went over the edge . Save your tears Marguerite . They say it 's a way off the plateau . Are you serious ? No one has ever returned to confirm the legend , but . That would be a grand joke if Summerlee got home before us . Do you think you can trust that lizard to keep watch ? For now – he seems to need us more than we need him . How do you know ? Why else would he save Roxton 's life ? Only if there 's something else he is more afraid of . After what his little war cost Summerlee Tribune doesn 't deserve our help . You don 't know that he 's dead . Maybe he has made it off the plateau . It wasn 't Tribune 's fault that Summerlee came here in the first place . It 's not your fault either , can 't blame yourself . He only came here because of my expedition . You didn 't ask him to join you . He came here to prove you wrong . And he was so happy when he found the Lost World 's real . You gave him his greatest adventure Challenger . Funny man . Never thought I 'd miss him . Coming to tuck me in . Just wanted to make sure you were safe . Always the gentleman pity . Now what , we swim ? I ah ... I believe there 's a little fishing village not far from here . You could charter a boat . The treehouse is just across the sea . I don 't see any boats on the water . Just follow the coast . There that should be enough . And what about you ? I 'm afraid this is where we must say goodbye . Oh just when we 've become such good friends . No tears please . We 'll see each other again , when you have the boat . So you 're not coming into the village ? What are you afraid of ? Trust me the locals tend to greet me with a little too much ' gusto ' . You planned this all along . Is that a weakness too ? Doesn 't look like the fishing 's too good this year . Tribune said this place was quiet but this is ridiculous . Get out of here . Funny place to look for a boat . I think we should split up make it easy to find something . Stay in plain sight . Maybe I should stick with you you know for protection . Oh you 'll be okay on your own . This place gives me the creeps . Don 't worry about it . I know how to handle guys like these . Last bets ! - Blue wins ! - It 's Fascinating . - Lay ' em down ! - Chips . Professor ? The introduction of a live variable the mathematics become intriguing . Greeennnnaah ! The house pays green ! I hope you know what you 're doing ? It 's not going to be easy finding a boat . If we are lucky enough to find one it 's going to cost a lot more than Tribune gave us . Three on yellow ! Bets clear ! Orange wins ! Yes ! - You new in town ? - Yes we are . Didn 't this used to be a fishing village ? Now it seems like all the fish have two legs . - That 's funny . Some very long legs . What happened ? Giant sea monster . Don 't you know ate all the fish . You better watch it this stuff packs a whollup . Just the way I like it . It 's more like a sea serpent you know . Ah well I feel better already . Once it ate all the fish it went after the boats . And the fishermen . Raina 's father - her brother - her fiancé . That 's terrible . We 're sorry for your troubles . That 's old news . Well you won 't believe it but ah were looking ... Looking for a boat . A boat is a very dangerous proposition . Well that 's what makes life interesting . Eureka ! House pays one winner ! After Nemak ruined the fishing . Are you saying he did all this ? They say he brought the sea serpent when it was just little . Now the casino 's the only work in town . We all work for him . A girls gotta eat . I can find a friend . All the way ! Get rid of that bum lock him up . You 're coming with us . I beg your pardon ? Is there a problem ? Yeah you . Can I help you ? Out of the way loser . Get back here you stinking cowards . Lock them up ! No goodbyes for your friends ? Those losers I never saw them before tonight . I saw you come in with them . Met them in the trail I offered to give them a hand . Then I guess you won 't be needing that boat after all ? Doesn 't mean the evening has to be a complete waste . - Let 's get out of here . - I never thought you 'd ask . When do we get to see a magistrate ? I 'll have to get back to you on that . At least you people don 't have to worry about dinner . We 're not cannibals you know . You ! Don 't make me go in there . Tribune What are you doing here ? Hmm slight miscalculation . Oh like forgetting to mention the sea serpent ? We found the lizard napping by the shore . Now we 're putting on a barbeque in his honor . He 's the main course . Did you have to win every bet ? Did you want me to lose on purpose ? Every once in a while might have been a good idea . Ah that 's ridiculous we needed the money for the boat . Even if we weren 't in jail nobody would sell us a boat . Then we 're just gonna have to borrow one . First we have to get out of here . Any ideas ? How much time do you have ? Where the hell is Marguerite ? Oh looking out for herself as usual . Well this is very manly . come here . Such a rush . I 've been looking at you all night . Nemak , a girl likes a little romance . Was it good for you ? Hold it right there . Oh , maybe you can help me ? What are you doing down here ? Are you all alone here ? Well that must get awfully boring ? I bet this would make it better ? - If Nemak found out . - Nemak 's asleep and who 's going to tell ? Now if you 'll just give me your belt . It 's very tempting but Nemak would kill me . He might but if I don 't get it now I will . I promise . What are you gonna do take it ? I guess you 've never seen one of these before . As I was saying drop it on the floor . You certainly took your sweet time . The man drinks like a fish . I was starting to worry I 'd run out of booze . And where did you learn to drink like that ? A little trick they taught us at the convent . Don 't just stand there hurry . Where are we going ? To steal a boat Excuse me ? What about the sea monster ? Whatever it is Marguerite it 's not invincible . It is so far . Challenger 's got a plan . Just a few details to sort out . Can we argue about this somewhere else ? I can 't leave Tribune to be tomorrow 's lunch . What ? The lizard that got us into this mess in the first place ? Nobody has to come with me , but he did save my life . He nearly killed you first . He nearly killed us all . I 'll catch up with you later . All right Are you nuts ? I 'll go with you . What are you doing ? Somebody 's got to look after you two idiots . You 've got to be kidding ? We 'll see you at the water . I 'm only making sure they get to the boat . I can 't be expected to row all the way back to the treehouse on my own . Hurry up before he wakes up . Now What ? A couple of things we might need . Stop turning . You may be comfortable now but by tomorrow you 'll be roast to a crisp . Drink this . Got any bullets in there ? Yes I just need a handful . Hmmm tasty – what is it ? Fruit juice . Very refreshing . internal basting for flavor ; every half hour as long as you can . How thoughtful . I wish I had this detail . Where are you supposed to be ? The other side of the square . I just wanted to see the lizard close up you know - Don 't take too long . - No . I knew you wouldn 't leave me . I don 't believe it he should be so hung over . You left without saying goodbye . So defending the ladies honor . Be glad it 's me and not him . How is this far ? All this excitement works up an appetite . If you 're still game I got you a boat . It used to be my brother 's . That 's great now all we have to worry about is a hungry sea serpent . One – two – three . So whose idea was it to throw the cartridges in the fire hey ? Clever don 't you think ? I could have been killed ! You could have been lunch . No chance , well ... less than one in a hundred and I thought that ... was a very good bet . If we can be as lucky with the sea serpent maybe Raina 's village can finally be free . Lucky ? Luck had nothing to do with it . Blah boys can you please get in the boat . Come to starboard , keep the Southern Cross on your port bow . Steady as she goes . Easy for you to say . Can you please say it more quietly ? What was that ? We 've got company . It 's the sea serpent ! My God it 's a Plesiosaur and it 's magnificent . Is that what all the fuss is about ? Ned ! Malone swim ! Come on Malone swim ! Grab the anchor Veronica we 're going fishin . Come on Veronica . Now Veronica - Now ! Hang on everybody . Ohhh is there a slow boat I can take ? It 's slowing down . Must be getting tired . It 's stopped . Oh no it spit out the anchor . Don 't worry it must be exhausted by now . It 's an air breather it will have to surface soon . How far can you throw this lantern ? You ever play baseball ? My father loved the game , here . Nice toss . Excellent work Challenger . Once I knew it was a Plesiosaur , an air breather , I could deduce ... George , George ... George can you please save the details till tomorrow ? Considerate of that beast to drag us almost all the way home . How much farther till we get to the treehouse ? Far enough that we should wait until daybreak . Too bad , it would be nice to be home . Home ? Well you know what I mean . We 'll be there soon enough . For now let 's find a safe place and get a few hours sleep . If you insist . Oh yes , I insist . What 's that ? A T-Rex . Ahhh a T-Rex hatchery . Let 's get out of here . Oh my God . Should we make a run for it ? We 'll never outrun it . Then we 'll have to make a stand . Against a beast like that I might as well use a sling shot . Everybody spread out . More ! Hey You ! Over here dummy ! Just stay still nobody move . Hey ! Come on big boy ! What ? Ah I ... I knew the cliff was there . I think I shall take this opportunity to say adieu . - Ahh really ? - Sadly . Sure you 're not planning another of your surprise visits ? Sure you don 't need our protection ? You 're too kind but I must be getting home . Oh Tribune – you 're welcome . You seem like a gambling man to me . How much do you want to bet that 's not the last we 've seen of him ? A true gambler only bets on a sure thing . Oh it 's good to be back . Yes it is . Even without the maid service ? We can 't decide which plant should carry Summerlee 's name . You 're going to name a plant Arthur ? Oh no . Dicroidium Summerlee-Ensis ... thought to have been extinct for a hundred million years . While Osteospurmum Summerlee - Ensis has never before ... been successfully bred outside of Africa . Well they 're both triumphs how will you decide ? Which ever we decide . I miss him . I miss his cooking . Bush chicken Arthur . Which I hope is a recipe Malone not some character description . He was never afraid to risk his life to defend us . And never afraid to cook dinner . Is anybody but me getting hungry ? I think I 'll go check on my hunting rifles . They haven 't been oiled in weeks and with all this humidity . Come along Veronica we should get these specimens back ... and see if any of Arthur 's other experiments have germinated . Right . Malone ? Well I 'd volunteer but there are some ... thoughts I want to get down on my journal while they 're still fresh . Of course ... what was I thinking ? It 's far too early for dinner .

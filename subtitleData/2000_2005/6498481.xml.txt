 There wasn 't always a war with the Centauri . But in my lifetime , it 's all I 've ever known . By the year 2050 , six years after the first attack , we 'd lost so many things . We 'd lost the sky to electromagnetic domes to shield the Earth from frequent air raids . We 'd lost the uncovered cities that the government forgot . We 'd lost democracy to global leadership . We didn 't expect peace anymore with the Centauri , because we came to see that peace wasn 't their goal . Their goal was Earth . The ultimate land war , with no boundaries . When I was a boy , I built toy rockets . I wanted to explore space and discover new worlds . I 've never seen a Centauri , but I knew what my father told me . I knew they were genetically superior , and they came after us with no mercy . I also knew they were the last thing my father saw . I stopped building rockets . There was no need for them . I build weapons instead . And I know my salvation . Her name is Maya . A little hotter . That 's good . Music on . No , no . Something else . Hooker , John Lee . Ah , that 's good ! Go , Johnny Lee ! Put TV on . - Watch the news for me , will you ? - News 3 . Hoping to catch a glimpse of their beloved leader , hundreds of people have thronged the Ballard Space Port - as citywide preparations are made - Spence ! - for the Chancellor 's arrival . - It 's on ! Music off . Water off . ... last week 's brutal Centauri attack on the Tolstoy Colony of Asteroid X-83 . What did I miss ? Alighting from a recent briefing with high-ranking officials at Sector 8 , the Chancellor visits our region for a secret meeting with government scientists . - Some secret . - Tolstoy colony was a bastion of peace and free expression in this grievous time of war . - Those who live there ... - Why do they leak these things ? They want us to think that she 's Joan of Arc and not some warmonger . Tonight , we 'll both be shaking hands with that warmonger . With one deadly strike , Centauri stormtroopers annihilated this idyllic community . - Well , I hope she likes talking politics . - This heinous act , this war crime will be avenged . Firefighter robots have finally extinguished the blaze , which has devastated Sutton Wood . Over 600 acres of forest were razed and authorities have closed off the area to all hikers and picnickers . The cause of the fire is unknown , but careless campers are most likely to blame . - Good morning , Mr. Siegel . - Morning , Spence . I don 't think they 'll get through the dome today . They can , and they will , sir . They can and they will . A mob of raucous anti-war protesters clashed with military troops , leading to 50 arrests . The poorly organized factions expressed opposition to the Chancellor 's strategic response initiatives ... Veterans Plaza . This station is Veterans Plaza . - I 'll see you tonight . - All right . Morning . - Good morning , Nelson . How 're you doing ? - I am " high quality " . - So tonight 's the big night , huh ? - Huge . Nervous ? - No . - Decided what you 're gonna wear tonight ? - No . - Don 't overthink it . Relax . I 'll give you a tip . She likes to be called " Chancie " . And when you get right up next to her , cup her right buttock in your hand and jiggle it really fast . She loves that . - Tight security this morning . - I guess Chancie 's a little paranoid . - So , how 's my favorite girl ? - She 's beautiful as ever . We went camping this weekend up in Sutton Woods . She loved it . Lucky you missed the fire . Who says we missed the fire ? Whatever med specs you give them , I want you to double the dosages on your order estimates . Yes , Doctor . And I want a nurse standing by until he stabilizes . - Yes . - How 're we doing on synth plasma ? SR 's still waiting . Okay , well , I 'll just have to contact Central Supply and see if they send some in the next month . We 're way over capacity , Dr. Olham . If you want to keep inviting more wounded , we 're gonna to have to move the party to your place . Dr. Carone , and I 'm barely awake . Rumor has it there 's another evac on its way here from Tolstoy . I 'd like to know why you told them we could handle them . - What do you suggest I do ? - We could ask evac to reroute . - Oh , to a worse hospital ! Forget it . - I am all for the war effort . I 'm not interested in the war effort . I just care about saving as many wounded as I possibly can . - Good morning Dr. Olham . Please enter . - What do you care about ? This morning I 'm saying good-bye to my youngest , and he says , I swear to God , " Dada , when I grow up , I wanna be in waste management . " - You tell me , should I worry ? - Little Joey 's on the slow side , isn 't he ? You know , I pray nights he marries well . There she is . Three years of hard labor . And you are now the proud father of an 80-ton baby girl . - July 16th , 1945 , 05 : 29 a.m. - What ? Oppenheimer tests the first atomic bomb in Alamogordo , New Mexico . 3 weeks later , the weapon hits " ground zero " in Hiroshima , Japan , wiping out 140,000 people . Oppenheimer sees the madness , and urges the UN to gain control of thermonuclear development . The government turns around and calls him a Communist sympathizer . And when it was all over , Einstein said , " Only two things are infinite , the universe and human stupidity . " And not sure about the the universe . " What 's the matter with you ? Nothing . I 'd say it 's ambivalence . I don 't have that luxury , myself , but then again , I see our people die every day . - Have we met ? - This weapon is a godsend . It will ensure the preservation of our race and our faith . Right , right . Do we know each other ? - I work for the ESA . - The ESA ? You 're here because of the Chancellor . I 'm Major Hathaway . Special Unit Enemy Infiltration . What 's this about ? - Spence ! - I got it . What the hell are you doing ? ! - Are you insane ? - Let 's go . Do you know who this is ? - Get off me ! You 're dead ! - Take him away . Are you insane ? ! Hey , Spence , who are you ? You know who this is ? I got it , I got it . Take him . Good . You 've come around . I 've been waiting on you . You 'll be thankful for those drugs . Spencer Olham was a genius . At 15 he 'd mastered differential and integral calculus . Harvard , M.I.T. , Ph.D. in biochemical engineering , Cavendish Laboratory , top subatomic physicist , and all by the age of 23 . Outstanding . No military record . Father John Olham , fighter pilot , distinguished service . Ship went down in historic Z-12 dogfight . M.I.A. case until they found his body at a Centauri P.O.W. camp . He 'd been flayed alive . Young Spencer was eight years old . Spencer Olham was a driven man . I 'm not happy about losing him . And when I 'm not happy , nobody 's happy . Wha ... Do you like jokes ? I have a joke for you . - Knock , knock . - Why are you doing this ? I 'll say it one more time . Knock , knock . - Who 's there ? - Not Spencer Olham . Three days ago our Special Ops team intercepted a Centauri Intelligence courier . This was on its body . Centauri , your native tongue . Sounds like a wild boar on the make . Anyway , we muddled through it and decoded your plan to infiltrate our installations using humanoid robots . What ? I 'm a scientist . You 're a scientist . You know , you things are really something . It 's not a mechanical robot at all , but a genetic cyborg , evolved from synthetic DNA . It breathes , sweats , bleeds , but right here , right now , it seems to have no idea what it is . Now this will really excite you . A Centauri hit list . Humans targeted for murder and then replication . This morning we found your target , Olham 's name , on that list . Wait a minute . This is a mistake . Now , I ... I know you think you know what 's going on here , but I can clear this up very quickly . - We have tests . - " We " ? Methods . You can run a spiral core PET scan ... - " We " . We who ? - or DNA amplification using a ... - Oh , I see you 've learned to patronize , as well . - Please , please . - Listen to me . DNA amplification- - - Your needle ship penetrated our outer dome . You murdered Spencer Olham when he was most vulnerable . Somewhere outside the city . - Somewhere unrestricted . Where ? - This is insane . - Where is your ship ? ! - Please listen to me . - I know you 're a tool for assassination . - You have no proof . Your meeting tonight with the Chancellor , that 's when you would detonate . I am Spencer Olham , you crazy fuck ! Do you know when my dog pleases me most ? It 's when he displays human qualities . Sometimes he cocks his head , puzzled . You 're not the prototype . We found this Cyborg trying to pass himself off as an engineer at one of our Mars bases . I 'm telling you , my name is Jack Stoller ! You 're making a mistake ! I got a wife and two kids ! Please don 't do this , I 'm begging you . Please don 't do this ! I am Jack Stoller ! You 're making a mistake ! My name is Jack Stoller ! My name is Jack Stoller ! Stop ! Please stop ! No , no , no ! The Centauri U-bomb . Annoying , isn 't it ? If I could blow us all to hell , then what are you doing here ? You 're not close enough to your target . The U-bomb is programmed to coalesce at trigger phase . Right now , you 're just a useless curiosity . Nelson . Jesus Christ , don 't let them do this . Please , tell them it 's me . You know it 's me , Nelson . Remember my wedding ? You got piss-drunk . You hit on Maya and you begged her not to tell me . Well she told me , Nelson . I never brought it up . I forgave you . And when Josh had an emergency appendectomy , I sat with you all night , and I asked you if you ever regretted having kids in this miserable war , and you said , " No , because they made it all bearable . " They made it all worth it . " It 's me , Nelson . It 's me . Please , help me . Memories , senses , knowledge , you pilfered them all . But there was one thing you couldn 't take from Spencer Olham . Do you know what that is ? " When the solution is simple , God is answering . " I quote ... - Einstein . - I know who said it , I want the answer . Can God give you the answer ? What was it that you couldn 't take from Spencer 's body ? Hmm ? His soul . I forgave you , you son of a bitch . Gentlemen , let 's ge started . That 's right , let 's get started . Hathaway 's a bit on the slow side , isn 't he ? Oh , too bad , he 's a little dim ! Hey , I got a joke for you . Here 's my joke for the day . Knock , knock . Who 's there ? Hathaway . Hathaway who ? Hathaway , the real target . You thought it was the Chancellor . Fatal error . Trigger phase activated . Countdown , 30 seconds . Tick , tock . Tick , tock . Tick , tock . When the solution is simple , God is answering . Strap him in the Vivisec . That 's right , you drill me . You drill me real good . We 'll all go out in a blaze of glory ! Long live the Centauri . Target lock . Kaboom ! He 's playing with you . He 's trained to do that . Strap in the robot . Watch your fingers . 10 , 9 , 8 ... Get back ! Put the gun down ! - Get back ! - Clear the room . Get back ! Attention , all ESA units . Enemy infiltration in progress . Enemy infiltration in progress . - I don 't see anything ! - Come on , move ! Run around that corner ! - Double-check that quadrant ! - Yes , sir . - All clear at 19-6 ! - Move back over here ! Move back ! Omega Six , status . Omega Two-Niner-Six , status . He 's on his way to the surface . Nelson , Nelson ! Hold on . You 're gonna be all right . Listen . Listen to me . You 're not gonna die . Veterans Hospital . How may I direct your call ? - Olham , Maya Olham . - I 'll transfer you . - Maya ... - Hi , this is Dr. Olham at Veterans Hospital . Please leave a message . If this is a medical emergency enter code 2112 . You 'll have 30 seconds after the symbol . Maya , Christ , I need to know ... - Spence ? - Maya ! God ! Are you all right ? What did they do to you ? Where are you ? - Tell me what they told you , the ESA . - They told me that you 've been arrested - for treason . - They think I 'm someone else . - They said that you 're a spy . - Maya , please listen to me . - Why you ? - They want me dead ! Listen . There is a test in the hospital . It 's something they missed . I took it three years ago . - A test ? What does this have to do with ? - If I can run another one , a comparative for proof , they 'll see that ... - It 's comprehensive . It 's undeniable . - You can 't come . You can 't . You can 't come here . You 're not listening to them , are you ? - It 's not safe . - Locking down sectors - 1-Gamma through 19-Epsilon . - Spence , I need to know where you are . I 'll come to you . - Initiating lockdown - I 'll find you . tunnels 20-Kansas through 19-Nevada . You 'll be thankful for those drugs . So ... The first question I have for you , Major , is this . - Why are we having this conversation ? - I take full responsibility . Effective immediately , I 'll hand the matter over to Captain Burke . - He 's a good man . - Pick up your weapon Major . A good man is not what I need . - Is the replicant still pursuing its target ? - We don 't know . - What is the range of the bomb ? - We don 't know . - Is there a secondary trigger ? - We don 't know . Given that the Chancellor is landing in 4 hours , is there anything you do know ? We know it 's either in the evac tunnels or out in the Zone . I recommend you evacuate the city immediately . You recommend that I set off a mass panic , and you can 't even show me an X-ray ? Mr. Secretary , the Centauri are well ahead of us in nanotechnology . The bomb , it eludes standard detection . The explosive parts coalesce at trigger phase . That 's when you 'd hear a ... big boom ! Don 't screw with me , Major ! - Now , tell me how we deactivate it . - We shoot it . We can 't shoot it , because you can 't contain it . It believes it is human . It wants to live . It knows fear . It will make a mistake . In the genius lies the defect . Lucky for us , it bleeds . And how many innocent men bled for your mistakes , before you uncovered the first replicant ? Ten . You don 't lose any sleep over those dead men do you , Hathaway ? We lost 10 and saved 10,000 . I sleep like a baby , Mr. Secretary . 533rd Street and Tyler Avenue , Old Grid . Census Bureau reports SimCode hit on Spencer John Olham . You shouldn 't be here . I said you shouldn 't be here . Attention , all inhabitants . You have 30 seconds to comply . Do not refuse , or you 'll be bodily subdued . Do not run , or you 'll be stopped by force . This man is a prison escapee . Take a good look at him . Have you seen him ? - Burke , give me an update ! - Zero read , sir . Either the masonry 's too thick , or they still have lead paint up there . All right , bring it out . - All right , let 's go . - Move out ! Move out ! Switch it on . Sir , we are draining 25 % of dome power . Ready yourself , gentlemen ! One floor at a time , Sergeant . Burke , we are up , and now scanning the building . I make four holdouts ground floor , and a fifth on the second . Second floor . Command , this is Alpha T. We 've got the hold-out on the second floor . I 've got another one . Third floor . Looks like a runner heading upstairs . 78 % probability by body mass . That 's fourth floor , Burke . Identify runner on the fourth floor . - Fifth floor . - Go ! Target is not moving . There must be old motors up there . - Goddamn it , Sergeant , give me a fix ! - Getting magnetic interference , sir . It 's topped out . Go slow , Burke . Your target is now on the roof . Sir , I am picking up ... - Got him ! Got him ! - Target-lock , 8 meters east . Go , go , go , go . Whoa . Identify your target , Burke . Target appears to be ... a little girl , sir . We 're bringing her down . Next building , gentlemen . He 's hot . He 's too hot . We shouldn 't have brought him here . What are you talking about ? The hotter he is , the bigger the bank , you know that . He 's wanted by the ESA . Just let me see if I can trade something for him , okay ? Spencer , John Olham . Married . No wants or warrants . No history of infectious disease . Work record classified . Now that jacket and this full-auto Glock 18 say ESA . But everything else about you smells like a shit backed-up civilian waiting on a heart attack . Which are you ? Look , those troopers will be back and they may not miss this place next time . - If you 're smart , you 'll just let me go . - Get up . Get up ! So where would it go if it was thinking like Spencer Olham ? - Sir ? - Next quadrant . Yes sir ! This way . Come on , this way . This way . - Border Patrol . - That 's right . They pay good cash for runners like you . You 're gonna turn me in to the ESA . Life 's a tragedy . Move . Whatever you 're gonna trade me for , whatever you can get , I 'll triple it . It 's too late ! House allocation , food rations , I can get you all of it . - Come on , help me out . - Too late ! See that dome right there ? A government program built that after . We were bombed by the Centauri . After we got turned into the Dead Zone . See , that 's how you G-freaks always deliver . Too goddamn late . Now , get up ! Walk . Walk . - Walk ! - I 'm not going back to them . I won 't die like that . You can kill me , but I 'm worth a lot more to you alive . - You 're useless to me . - Drugs . Narco-amfetamines , adreno-steroides , pharmaceuticals grade . - What ? - Jump , delirium ... - Anything you want . - So , what you think you got me down ? You think you know me ? - All Zoners are junkies , right ? Right ? - No , no , no . - That 's not what I meant . Not you . - You know , I don 't like you . You keep saying all the wrong things . Then listen to the words . I 'm not saying " junkie " , I 'm saying " pay-off " . I 'm offering you a real trade ! Punch in this SimCode , 746-218 . Come on . Just do it . Do it ! Maya June Olham . Pretty girl . 35 . No wants or warrants . - Associate Director ... - Associate Director , of Veterans Hospital , Central City Sector . She 's my connection . And she 'll do anything ... to get her husband back alive . Now , I know that you can run me into that city underground and I can get you inside that hospital supply . In and out , clean . So , what is it gonna be ? Dr. Olham ... I 'd like to convey my deepest regrets . I had ... great respect for you husband , his work . We all mourn with you . - I 'm Major Hathaway . - Yes , I know who you are . We haven 't found your husband 's body yet . But ... every effort is being made to locate his murderer , this impostor . I believe- - Don 't you think I 'd know my own husband , Major ? I think we 'd all like to believe that this never happened . And when did it happen ? This " switch " ? - While we slept ? While he showered ? When ? - We don 't know when . Oh , so , you don 't know for certain then , do you ? We know that the replicant poses a real threat to the public , Dr. Olham . And since it believes it is your husband , it will likely contact you , turn to you for assistance , or may have already . - Do you have a wife , Major ? - Pardon ? - Do you have a wife ? - Yes . Does she know you very well ? She knows I 'm a human , if that 's what you mean . And how does she know that ? Because I 'm not on a Centauri hit list and I 'm not walking around with a bomb in my ribcage . And for every second that we debate known facts , we are closer to mass murder . So ... I need to ask you a couple of simple questions . Has it contacted you ? No . Do you have any idea where it might go ? None . I 'm sure if something occurs to you , you 'll let Lieutenant Burrows know immediately . My men will be escorting you home to grieve . I have six wards running at twice capacity , Major . I 'll grieve when my shift is over . Nelson Gittes is dead . Murdered by the replicant , along with two of my men . Oh , I 'm sorry for them too . Take off your jacket . There is a big difference between you and me . And I 'm not talking about the obvious . See , me , I ghost in , I ghost out of the city . You ... The ESA will pick you off at the first census post . - You 're gonna strip my SimCode ? - Like I said , take it off . He 's gonna need a knockout . I don 't have that much . Whatever you got , keep it topical . Already got enough shit in me to embalm a horse . Government-issue Mercury Pentothal , my guess . Mmm , powerful drug . Give you bad dreams . Yeah , I 've noticed . - You got anything to flush it with ? - Adrenozine , maybe , but if we had that this would be a real hospital , and ... I 'd be a real doctor . Watch his spinal cord . You sure you don 't want to be out for this ? This hurts . Well , now nobody 's gonna know you when you 're visiting . Hey , put this on . And get rid of that G-coat . No , I 'll hold on to it . Could be useful . What did she do with the SimCode ? Don 't worry about the SimCode . She 'll shred it . Now let 's go . I 'd like to keep it . Souvenir . Hey . Wait here . Wait right here . I think you 've got some things you forgot to share with me , - Spencer . - What did they tell you ? Because if we don 't have honesty in our relationship , we have a dead relationship . - I 'm not what they say I am . - Then what are you ? - Just tell me what they said . - No , I want you to tell me . I want to hear it from you . You tell me ! They told you ... that they couldn 't surface , because it 's too hot up there . There 's too many military looking for someone - with my face and my name . - And what else ? What else ? ! Doesn 't this seem a little off ? Your friends ... know I 'm public enemy number one , that I 'm worth something , and then they just walk away ? Does it seem like your friends ? How about a trade , Cale ? Let 's talk trade . Safety . Where did you learn to fight like that ? What 's your name ? Cale . Is there anything else you wanna know ? No . Well , being that we 've become so goddamn friendly , why don 't you tell me what I wanna know ? All right , Cale . The ESA think I 'm a Centauri robot . They think I have a bomb inside my heart and that I 've been programmed to kill the Chancellor . Let 's get moving . Let 's go . Through this plaza , swing east , another few blocks , we 're there . You know , when you say it fast like that it doesn 't sound so bad . - He sees me . - Easy , easy . He sees me ! Come on , get up . Get up . Get up . Get up . What the hell is happening to you ? - It 's the drugs . The ESA gave me psychotropics . - I can 't carry you . I need to hear that you 're with me . I can 't trust my own mind . They 've gotten in my mind . I can 't tell what 's real . They want you to think that . They 're wrong about me . I 've done nothing . I 'm a good man . I didn 't know he was in there . My best friend . The doors opened ... I think I killed my friend . - How many do you see ? ESA ? - Exactly eight too many . I 'll just be a minute . Olham ! - Check the log . - Negative , no outgoing transmissions . How about incoming ? - One incoming within project sector . - Going back how far ? Data confirmed as of 0700 hours . All right , it 's time to jerk the leash . I want a house arrest , with a 24 / 7 watch . No , no , no . You keep all your men in place until you hear from me . I 'm telling you , it 's still prime stomping ground if it still believes it 's Dr. Olham . Census Bureau reporting new hit . Veterans Plaza . South Sector Promenade . SimCode number four-niner-seven . - That 's behind us . - Affirmative , Major . - How long ago ? Which direction ? - Stand by , Major . Patch it through to Burke . Tell him to get over here , and turn and burn some bodies immediately . Get me Burke . - I got him close . I just wanted- - - Listen to me . I don 't care if you 're crazy , dopped up , or you want to bust somebody , because they hurt your feelings . I got you here , remember that . I put everything on the line for you and I want my end . You 'll get it . - Olham- - - Look , I said you 'll get it . You know , I 'm beginning to think that the ESA got it right . - What do you mean ? - I mean maybe you are a bomb . Just don 't blow up in my face . Comm Center . I 'm at Post 4-9-7 . I need an update . Census Bureau reports target crossing your location 20 seconds ago . Target heading south . Lieutenant , take your men 1,000 meters south from here . Go ! You told me the hospital would be clean . - Just wait . - Why don 't we just do what you did ? Bump up against them and ask them to dance . Just give it a minute . Okay , so now you got me interested . And I won 't work half blind , so tell me right now . What 's in there for you ? Proof . They even have a name for where we are now ? It 's called " Re-allocation " . The military took finishing funds away from the hospital . Come on , this way . Attention , all available emergency personnel . Code 3-3-3 . Emergent Medivac Unit arrival imminent on Med Dock 5 . Countdown , 5 minutes . Stand by . I got another way . Okay . Second level , east side . Go ! - Comm Center , I am now at Post 4-9-6 ! - Stand by , Major . - I need men up on the east side roof . - Target passed your position 15 seconds ago . - Here ? - Affirmative , Major . It 's here . It 's right here . Emergent Medivac Unit arrival imminent on Med Dock 5 . Medivac Arrival . - Clear landing platform . - No , go back ! Anybody got a top sheet on this one ? Keep all your men in place until you hear from me . Target crossing your location 20 seconds ago . It 's still prime stomping ground It still believes it 's Dr. Olham . Target crossing your position 15 seconds ago . Hey , Olham . - Olham . - What ? Make me a giraffe . Somebody 's coming . Come on ! Hurry up ! Come on . Good evening , Dr. Hall . Please enter .. i Come on . Only now would I call this a good day . Get what you need , and get out . You don 't wanna be here inside 5 minutes . Cale , don 't waste your time there . The stuff you want is on the third level . You 're into the immunomeds now . That 's all ... macro antibiotics . I heard you . Yeah well , that stuff 's worth nothing to you , unless you got Thaipox . The woman in the Zoner hospital . It 's for her , isn 't it ? And the others . Look for something called Omnicillin . It 's a big gun . The military uses it for Thaipox and everything else . Now , you got about 2 minutes to do your damage and get the hell out of here . Right now , you can leave through the front door . After that ... Olham . Don 't shoot yourself . Check station 3 . So , drill me . Drill me real good . We 'll all go out , in a blaze of glory ! Long live the Centauri . Target lock . Kaboom ! Major , If I can suggest ... So ... when we were running in idiot circles , when did we pull troops ? Captain Burke ? I pulled about a third of my detail from the project site , sir . - What about the chancellery ? - In place , full complement . Lieutenant Burrows , how many men do we have at the hospital ? Attention , all personnel . An efficient hospital is a co-operative hospital . Please remove all medical waste materials and dispose of materials in waste containers . - Busy night . - 15 hours straight , thank Administration . She sends another evac every 5 minutes . That 's not very nice , Dr. Carone . She speaks so highly of you . I 'm sorry . - Where is she ? - I don 't know . - Where is my wife ? - I don 't know . She left with the ESA maybe a half-hour ago . You know what this is ? - A data spool . - For ? - Molecular-core PET scan . - Very good . Now , I want you to run a comparative test for me , and no ... I don 't have time to schedule an appointment . - Where is the alarm ? - We don 't have one in here . Look , this has not been one of my better days . So just give me my 5 minutes of machine time . Lie still . Call security . Spencer Olham is in the MPS room . I 'll find ESA . Olham ! Walk away , right now . Right now ! Don 't move ! Do not move ! No , no , the orderly 's with ... The orderly 's with him ! Security alert ! Security alert ! There is a security breach in east wing Pharmacology . All security personnel to the east wing . - It 's him ! - There he is ! - Hold your fire ! - Don 't want cross fire . He 's got nowhere to go . Don 't you move ! Get down ! Move it ! Move it ! Get down ! Get out of the way ! Get down ! Get out of the way ! Get down ! Get down ! Burke , where is it ? Is it down ? - I had a bead on it , sir . - Is it down ? ! - It was in my sight , sir . - I need a crash cart , now ! - We lost this one . - Move out ! Find me a body ! Give me your weapon . Give me your weapon ! - Just go straight back . Straight back ! - He went that way ! Eyes open . - Lieutenant , get me two men up there . - Two , go . Burrows , take a good look at this . If you had this kind of tenacity , you 'd be a general by now . I need a status report . There 's 80,000 square feet down there , Major . We 're still searching . Of course they are . As reported earlier the Chancellor was scheduled to return to the city for a function at the Defense Bureau earlier tonight , but that event was canceled without explanation and the Chancellor 's precise whereabouts are unclear . That blaze in Sutton Wood seems to be finally coming under control . Fire-fighting robots are said to have 90 % containment as of this hour . Investigators are still unable to declare an official cause of the fire , but they say they are taking seriously eyewitness reports about an electrical anomaly in the Sutton Dome ... We went camping this weekend up in Sutton Wood . Dome Authority has already ruled out a lightning strike - Lucky you missed the fire . - as the cause of that anomaly . Maya . Are they still there ? Are they right outside ? Maya , listen to me . - If it 's safe , then meet me . - Don 't say any more . - You 've got to trust me . Trust me now . - Spence ! Please ! If you still believe in me , all I ask is that you ... you meet me . Meet me where we first met . That 's all I ask . Spence ! Spence ! Keep walking . Where are you ? Maya . - Oh , God ! - Did they follow you ? No . I know you 're afraid . I know what they told you . That some ship got through the dome and landed somewhere outside the city . A cyborg destroyed my body . They were right in theory , - but they made one crucial error . - I don 't understand . The ship crashed . You see , that 's what caused the fire . They miscalculated . The Centauri never got to me ! I know the ship is here . I can find it . I 'll show you . Do you believe them ? You 're bleeding . - Do you believe them ? - I don 't know what to believe .

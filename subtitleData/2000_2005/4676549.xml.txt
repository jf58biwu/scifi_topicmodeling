 Cool ! Hey , Pop , you didn 't tell us we were going to Africa today ! Ahh , great . They 're up . Dude , look ! Elephants ! That 's ... Loxodonta africana . You can tell which ones are the males because they 're the only ones with tusks . I got no problem telling which one 's the male , bro . Check out the fifth leg on that beast . It 's called a trunk . It 's called you 're a spaz , and that ain 't what I 'm talking about . Brock , be ready with your tranq gun on my signal . Those two are going to be bouncing off the walls ... if they figure out where we are . Dr. Venture , you 're right on time . My assistant , Mandalay , is standing by to escort you ... Um , yeah , OK , great . That 'll be fine . Over and ... And may I take this opportunity to welcome you ... - Oh , crap . - To Brisbyland ! Brisbyland ! Brisbyland ! This is gonna be phat city ! I am all over that teacup ride ! Boys , halt ! You are " all over " no such thing . You 're both to stay aboard the X-1 . - What ? - Aw , weak ! Weak , schmeak , Hank . We 're here for business , not for fun . - But , Pop ! - What are you , on the rag ? It 's impossible for me to be on the rag . I 'm a ... I can 't believe I 'm even arguing about this with you ! What men 's room did you pick up that kind of trash talk in ? Nice . Well , I was going to let you go on the Runaway Shoe ride after my meeting ... but you two just sassed yourselves back on the X-1 ... so march ! Ahh , look at this family values freakfest . This place is so squeaky clean , it gives me the wicked jeebies . Hey , Pop ... black guy . You must be Mandalay . I 'm Dr. Thaddeus Venture . This is my bodyguard Brock . I , um ... Have an appointment with Mr. Bris ... Mute . Come in , Dr. Venture . Come . I 'm afraid your man will have to wait outside ... while we discuss business , however . Easy , Brock . He 's a cripple ... and he 's , like , 100 . What 's gonna happen ? Welcome , Dr. Venture , to the funnest place on earth ! Holy damn it Christmas ! Does my appearance startle you , Dr. Venture ? No , not at all . I ... as a man of science ... I see all kinds of things . Several years ago , I fell victim to an animatronic accident here at the park . Trapped beneath an unstoppable metal Lincoln for two hours . It 's enough to give anyone a stroke . Well , you ... Look like a million bucks . All thanks to this little bee . Panda 's milk ? Huh ? Um , OK . One of the rarest beverages on earth , and a natural elixir . It 's actually not that disgusting . That noise is making me nauseous , though . Oh , that ? That 's just Li-Li enjoying her lunch . Li-Li ? Yes , my longtime companda . I won her from David Bowie in a trivia contest . This was 1980 , ' 81 perhaps , years before the big trivia craze ... but then Bowie always was a trendsetter . Slippery Gulch sure looks fun from here . I spy ... an antelope ! They can run up to forty-five miles per hour . Oh , this sucks ! Why do we have to get stuck here ... while Dad and Brock get to tour Anna Bizzy Bee 's head ? So ... how long you work for this guy ? Now that we 've exchanged pleasantries and hot panda milk , Dr. Venture ... let 's talk business . I want you to clone me . Cloning ? I wouldn 't know anything about that , seeing as Congress has banned ... all cloning research in North America . Congress ? Bunch of out-of-work astronauts and C-list actors . They 're not men of vision , men like you and me . Men like ... your father . Your father and I were great friends , you know . In fact , he designed a number of the rides and attractions ... at the first Brisby theme park . You 're probably too young to remember . Do I have to , Dad ? You said you wanted to help Daddy , son . I vaguely remember him mentioning it . And I vaguely remember him mentioning ... he was dabbling in clone research . I 'm willing to pay handsomely for his notes alone . So ... this is about him , then , not me . Well , I don 't know if I 've kept any of Dad 's old notes ... Don 't play coy with me . Of course you kept them . You 've been riding his corpse 's coattails your entire adult life . Hey ! Where do you get off ? You don 't know me . Oh , I know you , Dr. Venture . My researchers are very thorough . For instance , you 're not actually a doctor of anything . You never finished school . I also know that since you took over Venture Industries ... profits have gone zippity-doo-dah . I ... that 's it ! The deal is off . I don 't care if you are rich . I don 't have to take this crap from a gimp . Aw , now they 're shooting off fireworks over Smile Island . Unbelievable ! I spy a ... I don 't have a card for that one . If you don 't knock it off with the wildlife cards already ... you 're going to be spying my foot up your wow-hole , Dean . Seriously . So that 's your final word , is it ? Yes . Call me a golf cart , I 'm leaving . - Now . - Yes , now . I 'm not spending another ... - Now , damn it , now ! - Hey ! What are you ... You 're all right . I spy a big , pink stinky , who stinks , and he 's stupid . That 's it , pussy willow . My hair ! Yeah , come on ! Come on . You gonna cry ? Brock ? Thank God ! His freaking panda 's trained to put me in a bag ! Why whatever is the matter , Mr. Samson ? Feeling woozy ? Perhaps you should cut down on your smoking . You 'd be surprised at the amount of chemicals ... the average cigarette contains . Chloral hydrate . That didn 't sound good . Those things 'll kill ya ! Mandalay ! Help me ! I 've come aflame again ! It 's gonna snap ! - I can 't hold it ! - All right ! Knock it off ! You are so lucky I had milk earlier . Uh-oh , there it goes . Uncle ! I admit that was a bit theatrical , Dr. Venture ... but if there 's one thing cartoons have taught me ... it 's that one can never be too careful . Your panda broke my glasses . We 'll replace them at once . We have many glasses here . We have everything you need . Where the hell is here ? Your home for the time being . Welcome , Dr. Venture , to the Brisby-dome ! This is that ridiculous giant beehive next door to your study , isn 't it ? You knocked me out and put me in a bag to bring me fifty yards ? Samson . Pretty . Samson , you are still with us ? You know I would never let anyone kill my Samson . Molotov Cocktease . That is my job . We only wanted your plane . We have no intention of hurting you , boys . Are you comfortable ? Do you want more juice ? Debbie , give the Venture boys more juice . - Where are we ? - And what do you want with us ? You 're in the gymnasium ... at the Orange County Community College ... and you 're being held hostage by the Orange County Liberation Front . Free O. C ! Well , our dad has a strict policy ... never to negotiate with terrorists for our lives ... so you 're wasting your time . We 're not terrorists ! We 're normal folks ... men and women with jobs and homes and families . Oh , that 's me . I gotta go . Peggy 's going into labor . That 's great , Todd . Give her my best . What do you two know about the man your father is working for ? Well , duh ! He 's Roy Brisby ... the guy that makes all those great Bizzy Bee cartoons . Where have you been ? He is the devil in the flesh , and that animated abomination he created ... is the angel of death bringing darkness to this world ! Won 't you reconsider , Dr. Venture ? Brisbyland was but a prelude , the next step ... is Brisby life ! And this Brisby-dome is the model . The perfect society in the Brisby mold . Safe , clean , self-sufficient , and for the mere price of a simple clone ... you , too , can be a part of it . Get it straight , you cadaver on wheels , I 'm not working for you ... and I 'm not staying in your crappy Brisby-dome . Did you forget about " no " ? I need you to clone me , Dr. Venture , that I might live to see my dream fulfilled . This dried old husk of mine might be broken and used up ... but my brain is as alert and alive as the day I scribbled my first ... Bizzy Bee . Now I see . You know , it took me a minute , but I just got it . Got it ? So you 'll come aboard ? Oh , no , no , no . What I just got is that you 're like a total jacked up freaky-deaky crazypants . I see . Mandalay ! No ! Brock ! Come in , Br ... I built an empire on the back of a cartoon bee , Venture . Did you really think I 'd allow you ... You OK , sir ? This is what you call wheelchair accessible ? How long has it been , Samson ? Three years , forty-eight days . Ah , yes . Prague , wasn 't it ? Or was it Lisbon ? - Akron . - Of course . Laser Zeppelin at the planetarium . However did you survive the fall ? Landed in a dump truck full of circus peanuts . You killed my father ! After you killed my partner . You took my eye . After you took ... my heart . Nyet ! You know I can only go to second base . Still ? After all these years ? I thought the Cold War was over ! It 's always cold in Siberia . You want one of these ? I got to go take care of something . I ask you , what honey does Bizzy Bee produce ? Destruction ! I think you must be mistaken . See ? This is Bizzy Bee . He 's really cute . I have his lunchbox , too , and all the toys ... Get that thing out of my sight ! I hate that damn bee ! Kill the bee ! But I like him . He 's devoured Orange County bit by bit to make way ... for the ever-expanding Brisbyland . The site where his new Brisby-dome now stands ... was once a beautiful residential neighborhood ... with a very convenient shopping mall . - Don 't forget the skate park . - A skate park , too . Right . Chad here used to be a professional skater . There was also a very pleasant Applebee 's . - Ted and I met at that Applebee 's ... - Debbie and I met at that Applebee 's ! Do you see what that bee has done to our beloved county ? And it 's not just here ! Brisby 's cartoon cancer has already spread to Florida ... where we 're loosely affiliated with the Sunshine State Freedom Front . Loosely . Those people are weird down there . Eurobrisby has gained a foothold in France . Times Square has fallen . Where is it going to end ? Well , I 'll tell you where . Right here , right now , with the help of Bizzy Bee himself . It 's our Bizzy Bee Club hats ! No . These were stolen from Brisbycorp headquarters ... last week by one of our agents . They 're prototypes . Aw , super-new Bizzy Bee Club hats ! - Neat ! Do they light up ? - No ! According to Brisbycorp internal memos , they were intended for mind control . Still think your little Bizzy Bee is cute ? Good . Then you two will make the perfect test subjects . The truth serum should 've taken effect by now . It 's time to learn what Dr. Venture knows about cloning . Mandalay , wake him . Now . State your name . Reading from top to bottom ... Lisa . Carol . Freemont . He 's telling the truth . Anyway , it wasn 't Brisby who took the boys . It was some sort of revolutionary group . Just a minute . Know where the boys are ? What do we want ? Free O. C ! What are we gonna do ? Kill the bee ! Jeez , Ted , those hats really worked . Did you turn them all the way up to " Patty Hearst " ? Orange County Liberation Front , we are ready . We attack Brisbyland tonight ! Ted , wait . I did the Liberation Front 's chart , and tonight is actually a great night ... to launch a new project for us . That 's great , hon , but we have to ... Plus , " Cosmo " says orange is this year 's black . That 's got to be a good sign , right ? All clear , sir . Brad and I will follow in his van . Over . Your bag has snaps . Mine has velcro . Look at this . Yeah , you got one of the new ones . I got mine back in ' 9 ... You know this robot ? Wait a minute . If I summon him , he 'll override the X-1 's controls and bring her back here . He 's programmed to come when we call him . Back to my car . I know where they 're going . I 've always depended on the kindness of strangers . This is ridiculous . We 're not getting anything useful out of him , sir . This serum must be interacting with something in his system . The man is a pill-popper , after all . Mandalay ! What 's happening ? Oh , mercy . Which one of you strapping young bucks will catch my fall ? Jiminy Crickets ! Do something ! Move , move , move . See if you can locate Dr. Venture . I 'll look for the boys . Nyet , Samson . I have my own mission to attend to . What ? What about helping me ? I help only my client . Did you forget ? I 'm a mercenary . Rally , Orange County Liberation Front ! Rally ! What the hell is going on out here ? Thank you , Brock . Yo , I just work here , man , and I don 't even need this job no more . Die , Brisby scum ! Listen , boys . Put down the firearms . Kill the bee ! We 're under attack ! Have my private jet ready to fly to Florida immediately ! We 're moving the operation to ... You know what I 'm here for , Brisby . Turn it over and you don 't have to die tonight . You don 't want to shoot me , boys . You know me . You know what I 'll do to you if you do . kill ... the ... bee ? What 'd you do that for , Brock ? Hello ? Anyone ? - Hey , Daddy ! - Hey , Pop ! Hello , boys . Brock ! You think you could help me out here ? I 'm starting to black out . Hey , wait a minute . We 're in Brisbyland ! Oh , you 're the best daddy ever , Pop ! Go Team Venture ! Yes , yes ... All went according to plan . There were no complications . The threat has been neutralized and your package has been secured ... Mr. Bowie . That 's good soup !

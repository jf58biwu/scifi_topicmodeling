 [ TV : Man ] Good morning , Washington . It 's a sunny new day here in the nation 's capital ... but don 't put away those umbrellas just yet ... as there 's a storm moving up the seaboard . The five-day forecast will follow today 's Washington Report . [ TV : Woman ] We 're at Secret Service headquarters ... for today 's Washington Report ... where officials are trying to piece together the final hours of Todd Baxter ... a young agent whose body was recovered from the Potomac River just last night . Todd . [ Panting ] [ Panting Continues ] [ Man Shouting ] Jarod ! Jarod ! Mike ! Through here ! - Stop ! - [ Shouting , Indistinct ] There he is ! Get him ! Stop ! Wait ! Wait ! Will you help me , please ? My car is broken down and I need a ride . - Please ? - All right . Hop in . [ Beeps ] Get me Mr. Parker . The Pretender has escaped . I 'm free . I 'm Todd - Baxter . - Jarod . - Jarod . - Got a last name ? - Just Jarod . Just Jarod , huh ? How about them apples . - [ Chuckles ] - Apples ? I , uh - I don 't know how I can ever thank you . Oh , just someday down the road do somethin ' nice for somebody . The Secret Service is baffled by the apparent suicide . After just three-and-a-half short years as an agent ... how did such a promising young man end up dead in the Potomac ? A question that may never be answered . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . - [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . - [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ TV : Woman ] More details emerging in the apparent suicide ... of young Secret Service Agent Todd Baxter ... who spent the final hours of his life at this D.C. hotel , the River Glen . Sources say he jumped to his death in the Potomac ... after a night of drugs and depression . However , friends and family we spoke with say this is not the Todd Baxter they knew . I 'm gonna make a difference . Does that sound hokey ? Hokey ? Is that a sporting event ? [ Laughs ] Yeah . Anyhow , all my life I 've known that , uh ... D.C. ' s where things get done . It 's a tough town and all that ... but with smarts and hard work , a guy can - Change the world . But what changed Todd Baxter ? Was it the pressure of life inside the Beltway ... the demanding years in the Secret Service ? The answers are through those doors . [ Radio : Dispatcher , Indistinct ] [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - Agent Holder ? - Yeah ? - Special Agent Wilkes . - Oh , right , right , right . - The behavioral science guy . - Yes , I just got in from the airport . I bet you didn 't have lunch , either , did you ? Here . You hungry ? " Cup O 'Soup . A meal in a minute . " That 's a rather clever idea , isn 't it ? - Idea ? Are you from the Seattle office or Mars ? - Somewhere in between . Well , I bet the boss wants to see ya . Talbot . He 's got the place buzzing over the Baxter thing . - You knew Todd ? - Yeah . Can 't believe he 'd do something like this . Neither can I. - Wilkes . Ellis Talbot . - Sir . Seattle faxed me your papers this morning . I could use a man with your expertise about now . Follow me . The maid called the D.C. cops this morning and they called the Bureau . F.B.I. ' s running things . Hoover boys are lookin at Baxter 's body now . From what I understand , he 'd been in the Potomac about a week . He put a " Do Not Disturb " sign on the door ... which is why it took the hotel people so long to finally get curious . [ Holder ] Which fits with the rest of the story . The night Todd checked in here , witnesses downstairs say ... that he met up with an old girlfriend in the bar , they came here for a little sex ... and a lot of heroin . Has anyone questioned the girlfriend ? The feds are still looking for her ... but indications are she was long gone before Todd went on his bender . And jumped . [ Talbot ] Demons like his , I sometimes wonder if I ever knew the real Todd Baxter . Sure you want to get out here ? Yes . - This will be fine . - All right . Your car didn 't really break down , did it ? No . Why did you help me ? My gut told me to trust you . Wait a second . There you go . Oh , no . I-I couldn 't possibly . You 've helped me too much already . Forget it . Have an ice cream cone on me . Ice cream ? Is it good ? [ Chuckles ] Yeah , it 's very good . Look , I don 't know what cave you 've been livin ' in , Jarod , but ... you 're ever in D.C. , look me up . I will . Thank you . Jarod ? You two work with the feds if you have to , but report only to me . So what is it you 're not telling me ? F.B.I. ' s floating a theory that this was a homicide . That 's where you come in . Baxter 's suicide 's embarrassing enough without far-fetched speculation it was a murder . You 're the behavioral science expert . Get them to see the truth about Todd 's psychological troubles . The truth is all any of us want . - Agent Ted Holder . - Hi . This is Special Agent Jarod Wilkes . Bailey Malone , Violent Crimes Task Force . V.C.T.F. The Bureau 's finest . I brought the Baxter autopsy files . You boys have some catching up to do . - [ Muttering ] - Daddy ? I just heard . Oh , there 's nothin ' to fear . The doctors just want the baby for observation . Your little brother 's gonna be just fine . After all , you helped my new son into this world , got me back to my old desk . I 've never been more proud to be your father . Oh , you got that look in your eye . - What lie has Jarod been tellin ' you now ? - It 's not Jarod . It 's me . I don 't know , it just - [ Sighs ] So much has happened in the last few weeks . Bridget dying , you coming home , the new baby . Ah , I understand . Yeah . You want things to be diffierent . Listen , come here . Come here . You must never lose your desire to get Jarod back . The new child is the future of the family , but Jarod is the future of the Centre . Why ? He 's our greatest achievement , our biggest asset . However , consider your life officially changed . It 's a brand-new day at the Centre . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Kiss ] My attempts at cross-pollination appear to be successful . Very good . Lies ! Damn lies ! Lies ! [ Jarod ] They finished the autopsy already ? Yes , it 's all there in the report . Oh , and get this - Malone tells me they 're not just thinking murder . They 're thinking signature killer . - A signature killer ? - Yeah . - Well , apparently their profiler has a theory . - Profiler ? - [ Woman ] That 's me . - [ Knocking ] - Were you expecting someone else ? - Call it deja vu . With a twist ending . - Jarod Wilkes . - Rachel Burke . - Agent Ted Holder . - Nice to meet you . Not to be rude , but isn 't your signature killer theory a bit presumptuous ? Well , it 's just that . It 's a theory . But there 's evidence to support it . - Like ? - Like our autopsy . It confirms that Todd Baxter did not die from a jump . He was strangled to death . Probably a piano wire . And despite a week in the Potomac , we found these . - Ligature marks . - On both wrists . Not exactly consistent with suicide . Not to be rude . And he was drugged , and there is evidence of sexual activity . He may have a sexual need to be tied up , maybe even asphyxiated . [ Phone Rings ] Or someone else tied him up . Your signature killer ? - Yeah . It 's just , uh - - Instinct . Somethin ' like that . They 've located Todd 's girlfriend , an Emily Sadler . I 'd like to question her myself . - I 'll keep you in the loop . - I look forward to that . [ Woman ] Todd and I met at Columbia . I studied journalism , and he was a criminology major . What they say about Todd is true . He was a really good guy . But he had demons . What kind of demons ? The kind he couldn 't beat . And this town made it worse . I 'd never seen him that wrecked . - He was in a bad place that night . - He had a drug habit , didn 't he ? Yes . It haunted him . Did you try to help him ? Well , what do you think I was doing that night ? That 's why I went upstairs . I was always tryin ' to help him . But then he pulled out the drugs , and he started drinking . And we started fighting . Some things were said , so I left . So you just ... walked out . Now that 's my demon . So , in your mind , Todd Baxter was perfectly capable ... of jumping off that balcony ? Yeah . He was always going too far . That 's the way he was . Unless you know something I don 't . [ Miss Parker ] This can 't be right . Sydney wouldn 't have trashed these . They 're like therapy for him . Ho-ho . Hello . [ Computer : Sydney ] Damn lies ! Always knew he was a mad scientist . - The Centre does that to you . - Go back to before he freaks out . Oh . [ Miss Parker ] Angelo . - Zoom in and freeze it . - [ Broots ] It 's a watch in a Centre bag . Angelo must have dug it out of the Centre archives . And being an empath , he had to know the effect it would have on Syd . I hate seeing him like this . [ Exhales ] How many black holes has Sydney helped me out of ? Why didn 't you come to me ? [ Talbot ] You got 48 hours to find the truth . The F.B.I. wants to chase theories , they can do it till their badges fall off . But I can tell you , I will not have my division wasting resources on Agent Baxter . - Tell Jerry we 're in , please . - Sir , he is one of our own . That 's not the issue . This whole mess has put a spotlight on us , and it 's a bad one . Are you suggesting that the F.B.I. is lying ? No . I 'm saying Agent Baxter was lying . For all we know , a heroin dealer killed him . It 's bad enough that this didn 't show up on a background check . - Now we have to find out the kid had a million sick habits . - A million and one . Jerry Linden , Office of Communications . Special Agent Wilkes . - Pleasure . - If a reporter calls you , send him to Jerry . Thank you , sir . Do not leak this . It 's not good . Agent Baxter was arrested in college - possession of heroin , intent to sell . Well , I guess we 'd better just drop the case right now . Case ? You sound like the feds . You got your 48 hours . Then you 're back in Seattle . May I have this ? You 've got it all on file . We don 't need this stuff about Todd floating ' around . Come on in . The shredders in Seattle are smaller . Secrets in D.C. are bigger . You should see the size of the janitor 's cart they haul this stuff away in every Friday . - Did Talbot put his personality through that thing ? - [ Chuckling ] Have a seat . Let me tell you somethin ' about Talbot . You know all that crap about Boy Scouts who run alongside the president 's limo ? He doesn 't just buy it . He lived it for 25 years . Todd Baxter would have too . Tell me something . If they were such good friends , why did she walk out of that hotel room ? I don 't know . He had an addiction . Sometimes walking 's the only option . [ Screaming ] Emily ! [ Yelling , Groaning ] Damn ! [ Groans ] - Are you all right ? - Yeah . They said muggings were up , but I had no idea . Thanks . I 'm glad you 're all right . Thank you . That wasn 't a mugging . I think you know that . Why did you leave Todd at the hotel that night ? What do you want from me ? He was my friend . It 's not my fault he couldn 't see that . He was murdered , and someone is trying to destroy what 's left of his name . I don 't think you want that . Why are you lying ? [ Sighs ] I came to this town to make a difference . You sound like Todd . - You knew him ? - He saved my life once . [ Sobs ] God , I miss him . Then help me . Help me protect his memory . [ Sighs ] Todd said he was meeting someone at the hotel ... but he still had time to help me with a problem I had at work . That was Todd . We had dinner and I left . I hadn 't heard from him in a week , and then ... I see the news . When they found his body . I get this phone call . The man on the other end knows where I live . He knows where I walk my dog , everything . - He asked you to lie . - He had the lie worked out . It was scary . I had to say that it was sex and heroin . Todd and I were best friends . Just friends . We were never together in his room that night , and he never did drugs . They said he was arrested for possession in college . A total lie . The man on the phone threatened to end my career . I didn 't care . Todd was my friend . I told him I was gonna call the papers . And then he told me to check my mailbox . That 's my father . They made me choose between Todd 's memory and my father 's life . I - [ Exhales ] You did the right thing . You did the right thing . Did Todd tell you who he was meeting that night ? No . Uh - [ Emily ] Allhe said was , " I 'm gonna be in the paper soon . " And then he tapped his briefcase . Like there was something important in it . I want you to stay at my place . You 'll be safe there . There 's no safe place from the monsters . Todd said D.C. was like a big masquerade ball ... only the people in disguise were monsters . If you want to make a difference , you gotta pull off a few masks . That 's why he 's dead , Jarod . [ Angelo ] No hope . No hope . What is " hope , " Angelo ? Sydney lost hope . Sydney lost hope . - What does it have to do with that watch ? - Centre takes hope . What did they take , Angelo ? Check Syd 's file . It 's a long shot , but see if there 's something about " hope . " Okay . Mr. Parker takes hope from Sydney . What does my father have to do with this ? [ Tires Screeching ] [ Sobbing ] [ Phone Ringing ] Hey , how about I cook you lunch ? No , thanks . I 'll pass . You have your vegetable , your chicken noodle , your shrimp gumbo . Shrimp almost tastes real . Mmm . Tempting , but no . This better be good . Todd Baxter tells his friend , Emily Sadler ... that his name is about to be put into the paper ... that he has something important in his briefcase . Three days later , Bill Radcliffi , reporter , covers Secret Service for the Washington Journal - dies in a car accident . An accident with one incongruous detail . Ligature marks , like those found on Todd Baxter . I believe Baxter was going to meet this reporter to expose something that he discovered . And that " something " was in his briefcase . All we found was office paperwork . What makes you so damn sure ? Let 's just say that I 've gotten into the mind of the killer . You 've what ? Think about it . The killer wants to cover up what Todd has discovered . That 's why he had to kill the reporter too . I don 't think so . The killer 's into the act - the power he exhibits over the helpless victim . There 's a purity in that violence . It satisfies him . I mean , if there is a cover-up , someone else is calling the shots . - Someone else ? - Yes . - And this theory is based upon what ? - Hold on a second . Hold on . There are two suspects ? You two might want to get on the same page . You 're running out of time . Holder , come into my offiice . You and I , we have to talk . - Talbot could shut us down . - Not me . He could seal the evidence . It would take months to reopen the case , even for the F.B.I. - You and me , we have to work together . - Yes , but not blindly . But you can make these leaps of logic ? How does that work ? It 's complicated . Well , that isn 't good enough . There 's evidence of a cover-up . - Not by this killer . - Then by who ? Todd Baxter was at that hotel room to meet the reporter ... so he could expose the killer . - Has it ever occurred to you that maybe he needs to kill ? - " Needs to kill . " No . Maybe you ought to get into his mind again . How does that work ? It 's complicated . [ Exhales ] You know , Jarod , I think that under different circumstances you and I - Yes ? Still wouldn 't have gotten along . Is that so ? Well , for starters , you drink processed powder and hot water . You never know how tasty something 's going to be unless you try it for yourself . Well , if we ever make it out of here , I 'm gonna show you what real food is like . - I make an amazing bouillabaisse . - Really ? Mm-hmm . - Can you drink it out of a mug ? - You can drink it out of whatever you like . [ Chuckles ] You 're lookin ' for your family ? Yes . They 're out here somewhere . I lost my dad when I was 10 . It 's a tough age to become man of the house . - You grew up fast . - Very . But it taught me responsibility , to always do the right thing . And make sure others do too . [ Chuckles ] [ Todd ] Make sure others do too . [ Emily ] All he said was , " I 'm gonna be in the paper soon . " And then he tapped his briefcase . [ Jarod ] Like there was something important in it . Doesn 't make any sense . You know , the thing I can 't understand about these papers , Jarod ? Why kill Todd over these ? They 're all random , not connected . Not even by a specific case . It 's like somebody just grabbed them . To replace the ones that were originally in his briefcase . If somebody did switch ' em , then Todd definitely had the goods on him . The question is , who . Hang in there , man . We 'll get him . [ Phone Rings ] - Agent Wilkes . - It 's Malone . Listen , I went over those papers you sent from Baxter 's briefcase . Nothing . - However , I found something interesting . - What ? That heroin charge against Baxter from his college days ? - It 's a fake . - Yeah . The campus cop who arrested Baxter doesn 't exist . - Someone 's trying to smear his past . - I 'll have to call you back . [ Dial Tone ] Let 's take a walk . Let me share something with you , Agent . I 'm under review , and I 'm not inclined to believe in a conspiracy ... but I know what city I 'm in . If this Baxter thing keeps goin ' south ... we 're gonna ruffle some feathers , and we 're gonna get clipped . What about Todd Baxter ? Whose feathers did he ruffle ? What do you mean ? There was something in his briefcase that someone didn 't want exposed . He also had heroin , barbiturates and some fuzzy handcuffs . The kid was messed up , Jarod . I hired Baxter . You think I want to believe this ? He was convicted of possession in college . We should track down the arresting officer . He already did . You talked to the officer that arrested him ? Yes . I would have rather not . Trust me . Jerry 's seen the truth on this thing from the beginning . And I 'm beginning to see it myself . [ Emily ] Linden switched the files ? Nice theory . But you got no proof unless you find the originals , and they 're probably long shredded by now . Well , then it 's time to go digging through some trash . [ Glass Shattering ] - Typical shrink . Just flat nuts . - Lies ! It was in a Centre evidence bag . - Who did the watch belong to ? - I don 't want to relive that . Relive what ? We helped him . It was awful . Then get it out in the open . It 's a brand-new day at the Centre . Remember ? All right . Years ago , Sydney killed a woman . [ Malone ] Agent Wilkes . Just the man I 've been looking for . What ? Nice working with you again . A year ago , you worked with us on a kidnapping in Atlanta . You used a different name . Who the hell are you ? Who are you working undercover for ? Congress . I work for an oversight committee ... that keeps tabs on local and federal law enforcement . That explains your badge in Atlanta . What brought you to the Service ? The committee smelled a rat in the Baxter case . They sent me down . Still doesn 't answer all my questions . I 'll answer any question you want . But right now , I found Todd Baxter 's killer , and I need your help to get him . Syd killed a woman ? In a car accident . It happened during the early stages of the Jarod Project . Syd hired a college intern from France , a young girl . [ Broots Exhales ] She was pretty . Apparently , they were having an affiair . They 'd gone to dinner and were driving back when Sydney lost control and broadsided a tree . She died two hours later in the hospital . - Her name was Hope ? - Claudia . When Angelo said Sydney lost hope , he meant it . Now , these are the Centre records of the accident . I 'm hoping that 'll help us find Syd . Provence Restaurant . This must be where they dined before - - Worth a try . - Yeah . - Did you glue this together ? - Yeah . It 's all 6,422 strips . - After that , I got bored . - Mmm . Yeah , well , Baxter certainly wasn 't . Between these articles and those confidential memos you pieced together ... Baxter connected Linden to numerous illegal operations and other so-called suicides . Todd was definitely trying to make a difference . - How about those apples ? - Them apples . - Hmm ? - It 's " How about them apples ? " Oh . I knew it was something about apples . Bailey told me who you worked for . They the ones who showed you how to get into a killer 's mind ? No . That was more home schooling . That 's some home . You don 't want to know . Well , I decided not to wait . Try this . - Is this your bouillabaisse ? - Mm-hmm . Mmm . Mmm ! How do you have time to track a killer and make something this delicious ? Well , we all have our secrets . Don 't we , Jarod ? It only helps until the next morning . And , uh , I 'll be back then . We know about the accident , Syd . Look , I 'm here with some of my favorite ghosts . Can 't you see ? So leave me alone . You wouldn 't let us off that easy , so forget it , Sydney . It wasn 't your fault . You have to let Claudia go . I can 't . We 're celebrating . Why ? Because . Because they used her against me . Syd , the Centre helped you . The Centre sure helped . They were there right after the accident . Centre Sweepers yelling ... " Oh , we 'll give Claudia the best care . " And then ... two hours later ... I got the news . I gave her this watch for her birthday . It would have been yesterday . How did Angelo know about - [ Chuckles ] Angelo . How does Angelo know about anything ? He knew that you need to deal with this pain , Syd ... that you were in love with her . That wasn 't Angelo . - They told you that . - That 's what my father said . That 's what the file said . - Centre lies ! - Careful , Sydney . Oh , no , much later , when I found out what the Centre was doing with Jarod 's work ... and I rose up in protest - They used the accident against you ? I did love her . Like my daughter . She was my student . But the Centre fabricated some story of an affiair between us . They threatened me with jail . - They threatened - - To separate you from Jarod . Yes . They used it to force me to do their bidding . Not only was Claudia dead , but they tried to destroy the very memory of her . My father did this to you ? Not directly , of course . But , yes , Mr. Parker was running the Centre . Now have a shot . [ Jarod ] Todd Baxter knew too much . He connected Linden to several major illegal operations - character assassinations , extortion ... among other clandestine things . Your director of communications has had six Washington jobs in the last seven years . Yeah . Travel office , D.O.J. cover-up , framed a D.O.E. whistle blower . Watergate plumbers got nothin ' on this guy . Hasn 't paid this well since G. Gordon Liddy . His offshore accounts are packed . Agent Baxter found out , and that crafty son of a bitch killed him . Made it look like a drug overdose so I 'd shut down the case . - He played me . - Except Linden isn 't the killer , is he , Rachel ? Are you two reading each other 's minds now ? Murder is not in Linden 's profile . He likes to control the truth , but only from the background . He was never in that hotel . - Think he had someone do his dirty work for him ? - Mm-hmm . - All right . When do we move ? - [ Both ] We don 't . There 's a killer out there , and Linden is going to lead us right to him . Daddy , the Centre did this . You did this . You forgot . The Triumvirate gave the orders . I carried them out . - I knew you would say that . - I don 't like your attitude . Daddy , please . I just want Sydney to have some closure . [ Sighs ] It can be arranged . - [ Intercom Beeps ] - Mr. Morgenstern . [ Gasps ] Claudia . [ Speaking French ] [ French ] Oh , Sydney . [ French Continues ] When you told me what Sydney was going through , I had her flown in . She 's a groundbreaking psychiatrist at a teaching hospital outside of Paris . A hospital funded by the Centre . After the accident , she healed up quickly . We gave her a future , a career . And told her that Sydney was dead . Well , that 's one order I wish I 'd never taken . Angel , a new life changes everything . I told you . It 's a brand-new day . - [ Rings ] - Communications . Linden . [ Jarod ] I 'm watching you . Who the hell is this ? I 'm the man you hired to throw Todd Baxter out the window . - Baxter committed suicide . - No . You hired me to kill him , didn 't you ? I 'll take that as a " no comment . " If you care to explain yourself , off the record ... meet me at the River Glen Hotel ... room 814 . Hello ? Hello ? Anyone here ? You don 't think I 'd be foolish enough to be armed , do you ? I 'm about to find out how big a fool you are . Agent Wilkes . - So what is this ? - It 's the River Glen Hotel . Not exactly the Watergate , but scandals can be made here as well . Well , I sure hope you brought your wallet so you can buy your freedom . Innocent men don 't need to . [ Jarod ] These documents that I stole from your office - they seem to say otherwise . Well , aren 't you industrious . Fabrications designed to destroy an honest man . Like the ones you create ? Like the ones that Todd Baxter discovered ? You make a fortune creating scandals that ruin people 's lives ... even end them . Jarod , if you 're trying to get me to make a verbal admission ... for something I know nothing about ... for you or ... whoever else is watching - Damn it . I 'm afraid you got the wrong fool . [ Sighs ] You 're right . I am a fool for ever believing you could possibly just tell the truth . - We 're done here . - Oh , we are just ... getting started . - We 'd better get in there . - No , just give him a minute . - I wouldn 't want you to miss it . - Miss what ? Your suicide . [ Gasps ] [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] # [ Whistling ] What are you doing ? I 'm setting the scene ... just like the man you hired to kill Todd Baxter did . [ Groans ] I 'm gonna make it seem like you had an evening of ... drugs . Then you took a swan dive out the window . Hope they find your body sooner . - No , wait . Wait ! No ! - Mmm . No waiting . No ! No ! [ Grunts ] Who did it ? You tell me who killed Todd Baxter ... or they 'll be fishing your body out of the Potomac-what 's left of it . - I can pay you . Just forget about Baxter . - Money ? - Yeah . - Todd Baxter saved my life ! - You killed him . I 'm gonna even the score ! - No ! You 're crazy . Plan " B. " Plan " B. " Go to plan " B " ! What are you doing ? You warning your accomplice ? You tell me who killed him , or I will drop you out of this window ! Holder . Agent Holder . - Where is he ? - He 's in the service elevator at the end of the hall . - Get up ! - No ! No ! No ! - Good luck . - Yeah , you too . Is this more bouillabaisse ? No , I only had 30 seconds . It 's chicken noodle . - [ Laughs ] - The chicken almost tastes real . Mmm . That 's why you 're undercover . You 're alone in this world . We all have secrets . No family ? No one to get close to ? Not yet . I should get back to the office . Jarod . This-This was more than just a case for you . Why ? Let 's just say I was helping out ... an old friend . Well , if you ever need a new friend , you can call me .

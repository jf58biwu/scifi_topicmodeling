 You 've been around long enough to guess how this little device works . I leave the premises and it self-activates . Ten minutes later , I 'm looking for my head in the next galaxy . Something like that . You 're next . Thrilled . I 've interfaced with the security monitoring system . We now have coverage of the whole sector . Sergeant Viesidra is online . Oh , yes , it 's been a long night filled with rare items , but this one is very different from the rest . Fleshy but firm . Soft yet still hard . For this fine drink of nitro , we should charge by the yard . There you go . Every badass in the underground is here , and me without my party dress . Got any ideas how to get this piece of jewelry off ? There 's a weak link in the device . A precise laser incision will extricate it from her throat . Just isolate the target , Sarge , and retrieve the pod . We 'll take care of everything else . Right . You go , girl . Shake that moneymaker . Bingo on Sluggo . Nice piece of work . Who 's the Jenny Craig poster boy ? It 's not who he is , it 's what he 's got . Sluggo discovered the original design pod for the underground . So he 's got a map ? The map . Every level , every corridor , every trap door , everything . Gauntlet charge activated . Plans to the Death Star . Cool . No , not " cool . " He 's going to auction it off to that room full of mutant scum . Whoever has the pod controls the underground . Ah , so that 's why Voice wants it . Mmm-hmm . So what 's Sarge gonna do , pick his pocket ? It 's not on him . It 's in him . You know , your mother must be so proud . I think I want you . You want me , huh ? Well , that 's good . 'Cause I hear the fastest way to a man 's heart is through his chest ! Good girl . Good bye , love handles . Good bye , Sluggo . He 's a droid . He 'll live . Come to mama . UH ! She 's got the pod ! Hi . What 're you doing out here ? Kill her ! Hel ? Mauser ? Change of plan . Meet me at Landing 29 , Shaft 7 . My clock 's ticking , and it 's not the biological one . I 'm on my way . No , Helen . Send Cleopatra . Send Cleo ? Send who ? Voice ? Oh , no , no , no , no , no . I - I-I need more training , more conditioning . More gizmos for my gauntlets . I 'm not ready for this . Voice ! A - Am I ? Five hundred years into the future she will enter a world where machines rule the earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . " In the year 2525 " " there are women with the will to survive " " Fighting for a brand new day " " Nothing 's gonna get in their way " " And in the year 2525 " " three women keep hope alive " " Joining forces to reclaim the earth " " Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth " Subtitles by subXpacio CLEOPATRA 2525 1x07 " RUN CLEO RUN " Are you on your way , Hel ? Come in , Hel ! We 're making a plan . Hang on . I am not sending Cleo . Don 't second-guess me on this one , Hel . Cleopatra has to go . She can do what needs to be done and I need you here . Why ? You 'll understand . If you want this mission to succeed , you 've got to trust me . You 're running out of time . Do it . Load her . I 've loaded the graphic so it will free-float with you . You will have full gauntlet capacity . Think it , and it will trigger the mechanism . For the record , I have to say that I 'm not behind this decision . Remember , your brain is the computer driving all devices . This is every known variable between the lab and Sarge 's egress point . You can learn this as fast as you can think it . Concentrate . There 's a shaft around here somewhere . This is bad ! She better be there , Hel . Landing 29 , Shaft 7 . Landing 32 , Shaft 6 . What 's a few floors and a sector between friends ? Okay . This is bad . Sorry . " There 's a guy over there " " He ain 't got any hair " " Smells like an old shoe " " But what can I do ? " " I got the mutant bar blues " " It 's been a lot of mutant bar blues " " This place is so beneath me " " The guests , they make me queasy " " I got the slime-hugging , nose-plugging " " time-for-me-to-get-running mutant bar blues " " Yeah ! " Bye . Light a match when you 're done . Ugh ! Ugh ! Where is she ? Damn it . Sarge ! Cleo ! Hurry up ! Come on . Move it ! Sarge ! No ! No ! For the record , I just want to say that I am not at all happy with this decision . Wrong . It is untimely , it is reckless and you are putting both Sarge and Cleo 's lives in jeopardy . I haven 't left ? Only in your mind . You can learn this as fast as you can think it . Concentrate . Shaft ahead in five , four , three ... Never mind ! She better be there , Hel . Landing 29 , Shaft 7 . Landing 32 , Shaft 6 . The stairs . Coming through ! Hey ! Move it or lose it ! Big girl 's gotta make it . Why don 't you boys take a break ? Hi ! So , is anyone here from out of town ? Birthday in the crowd , perhaps ? No ? Anyone celebrating some kind of Darwinian evolution perhaps ? Oh ! Wow ! Here 's a face only a mother could love . Assuming your mother was a pig . Gotta go ! Okay , so I 'll go shoe shopping . A girl could have worse problems . Where is she ? Damn ! Cleo , move it ! Sarge ! I 'm running out of time ! Just line it up and take the shot ! Take the shot ! No ! Wrong again . Sarge , change of plans . Cleo 's on her way . What ? You 're sending Cleo ? Send her . Have you run all this through in your head ? Do you know what you 're doing ? I could run it 200 times and still not know . Send her now or we 'll lose the pod forever . Not to mention Sarge . Send her ! If Voice thinks I can do it , I guess I can do it . Okay , Cleo . Run . This is not the time for a training mission . Sarge is in trouble . Cleopatra will get the pod . What about Sarge ? Cleopatra will get the pod . That 's not good enough . You 've got your priorities , I 've got mine . She better be there , Hel . Landing 29 , Shaft 7 . Don 't sweat it , Sarge , I 'm right behind her . That 's my girl ! Go , go , go . I saw this in a movie once . Please stop ! Please stop ! Nice work , little sister . Come on . Move it ! Sarge ! Catch this ! Got it . I 'm running out of time ! Take the shot ! No ! You take the shot ! Catch ! Good thinking . Uh-oh ! Behind you ! It 's gonna blow ! Hurry ! Sarge ! No ! I got it ! Are you okay ? Yeah . Ugh ! Sorry . You made it . Just in the nick of time , but I 'm learnin ' . Yeah . So am I. Whoever has the pod has the power , right ? Assuming you can hold on to it . Congratulations . The team did it . Yeah . And I know just who the team is . I 'm lookin ' at ' em . Hey , Hel , let me see the pod . No . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

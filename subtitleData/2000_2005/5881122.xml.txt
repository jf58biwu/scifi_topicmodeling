 Previously on Farscape . When I was a kid , I dreamed of outer space . This ship is dead ! The wormhole experiment is over . Moya feels Talyn has earned the right to be buried in the Sacred Space . We all knew the time would come when we 'd split up . I 'm coming with you . - No , I 'm sorry . Do you love John Crichton ? Do you love Aeryn Sun ? Then don 't make me say goodbye and don 't make me stay . Aeryn is with child . Pilot , patch me through to Aeryn . She is beyond our range , Commander . Get a fix on her position . We 're going after her . Commander ! Stay clear ... We 're ... being ... pulled in ... Commander ! You have got to be kidding me . I know I seem a little obsessed lately . But it 's been a long time since you rescued me . Are you hearing any of this ? Pilot , if you 're there . Almost out of fuel . Need a little help . Look , I 'm trying to apologize . I accept my friends aren 't coming back from the wormhole . You 're on a beautiful old ship and I can 't leave you guys . So please let me back in . Yo , Your Ladyship ! I 'm sorry , Commander . I must have ... dozed off . - Dozed off . Faster , faster ! Allegro ! Allegro ! Now bring in the horns ! There is a store of krillian-alloy ore on Tier Seven which might ... Oh , no , no . My module can 't process it without purification and reduction . Then there 's nothing aboard that can facilitate your escape before we die . So few Leviathans are able to end their physical existence in this Sacred Space . Elack and I promised each other this when we were joined over 350 cycles ago . I 'm sorry . Well , could be worse . You don 't roll in , I 'm dead long time ago . Besides , I 've almost cracked Wormholes for Dummies . Why would I stick around after that ? Hyah ! John , sorry I didn 't notice it sooner , but there 's a small craft approaching . And Commander , it is out of control . Go fetch . If you are sober or sane enough to understand , I suggest you aim that behind you . The creatures following me execute on sight . Ah ... Now , what are you going to do for me ? My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . This is a dying ship ! There shouldn 't be anyone on board a dying ship . Absolutely correct , Tinkerbell . Okay , my turn . Who , what , when , where , why and how ? You must listen to me ... - Oh , no . No , no , I 'm no good at listening . My brain cannot tolerate translator microbes . I 'm ... I must learn your language through hearing it . This . The name , the word . Winona . My pulse pistol . More words . They will be here soon and you will be dead before you see them . Module . Box . Workbench . Junk . More junk . Tools . Bulkhead . Ceiling . Floor . Shirt . Wine . Face ... Your alphabet . In order . God . Damn , that 's been a long time . A - B-C-D-E-F-G ... H - I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P ... Q - R-S-T-U-V ... W - X-Y-and-Z . Now I 've sung my ABCs ... - Commander ... Yeah ? Hello ? Another vessel approaches . A much larger one . Can she Starburst ? You speak Pilot . Yes . Right . ' Course you do . Ah , no . Dying ship , remember ? No Starburst . Muerta . Dead . Toast . Make sentences . Nouns . Verbs . Okay . Once upon a time , I was happy here . A little on the lonely side , but that 's okay ' cause at least Winona only had to start cooking fires . You know , fire . Whoosh , fire . Module 's out of fuel , so it 's not going anywhere . So , I 'm working like a mo 'fo . And everything is finally coming together on these crates here , till you smash through , pissing me off just a little bit . See , the only thing that I still had going for me , you just destroyed , lady . Yeah ! The Grudeks will shock the hull , incapacitating most functioning . Ram ... Wh-Wh-What about the Pilot ? Muerta Pilot ? Muerta , muerta Pilot ? No Pilot muerta . No , they need her alive to harvest the toubray tissue . We need an enclosed space . Self-contained circulation . They are going to fumigate ! - Grudeks . Grudeks . - God , I love ' em . Who the hell are they ? Toubray hunters . You got a quick ear . Toubray is Leviathan neural cluster tissue . Many cultures consume it to enhance higher brain function . And you were with ' em ? Till I fled for my life . That 's going to be your song , if you don 't give me an explanation . Ah ! No touchy . The organization I work for was hired to find Leviathans . I was given half a cycle to become an expert on their functions and their habits . So you can cut ' em up into sushi . Why do you think I 've worked so hard to find the Sacred Death Space ? 'Cause old Leviathans are easier targets ? And the toubray is richer with age , so the Grudeks are happy . But my reasoning is this Leviathan is near dead anyway . Harvesting it is better than killing a healthy creature and everyone on board . So , you Jacques Cousteau your way upstream to where they die . At least you 've thought about it . Your capacity for self-delusionment astounds even me , and I live inside your curdled brain . Hey man , you don 't like the Baywatch thing , head inland . How many men have a goal , a challenge ? A destiny as clear as yours ? Stay focused on the riddle of the wormholes . Affect the things you can . Satisfy yourself , John . Sno-cone ? Ah , yeah . Cherry . He 's right , you know . Tell me again . Why did you leave ? You assume that the answer is going to be different from the other thousand times you 've asked the question . " Because " is not an answer . I 'm not right for you , John . I was just the best of limited choices . That 's my kid , you know . That 's Crichton 's kid . This is my child . Whatever . Extraction party secure . Breathable atmosphere . Heir to Command report ? Awaiting , Warlord . Scout the region . Identify additional prey . Await my summons . As you command . Good hunting . 5,000 crindars for whoever locates the Y 'tal Cavity ! And a thousand more for the female corpse ! Come on , Pilot . Snap to . Come on . Just boost fluid to her hydrex gland . Shh ! We have bad guys on board . Can you space ' em ? Elack is still dazed . I have virtually no systems at my disposal . I recommend you save yourselves . What about you ? We are old . We must accept our time is soon anyway . Perhaps in passing we can serve some purpose for others . She 's the Mother Theresa of the Uncharted Territories . Look , you don 't mind if we fight for you , do you ? Do you have any DRDs left with weapons ? Can we negotiate with these guys ? That is not their way . Grudeks my ass ! It 's time for a show of force . If we had any . Didn 't get that one , did you ? 'Cause it 's Klingon . Time for you guys to clear out ! There is no quarrel with you ! Remain clear and you may live ! Oh , no . No , not if you destroy my ship . Flee then . I award safe passage . - Ha , you know what ? - Flip that around . You got 60 microts to ... It 's a show of force . It 's the only thing that Klingons understand . Make them think you 're dead . Okay , Sputnik . No . You missed ! Release the Brindz Hound ! Hound ? What are we talking , tracking dog ? Blood hunter . How big ? What ? ! Look , you see this ? Itty-bitty doggie ain 't gonna like it . There should be a pressure hatch here to a crawl space between ... Hamman side , two tiers up . No , no , Leviathan schematics clearly indicate that the ship ... Schematics ? What schematics ? I thought you were an expert . I am . I found the burial space . There should be a hatchway and it should be here . Every Leviathan grows to accommodate its passengers , its pilot 's whim , its ... Oh , my goodness . You 've never been on one before , have you ? You can 't learn Leviathans in the library . Hamman side . All right . None of the doors work ? Because it 's a dying ship . Nice puppy . Okay . Stick with me . You 'll be ... o ... kay . Shift your gravity center . Hurry ! Do what ? This is big . Obviously you need to get out more . Is it torn bad ? No . But it 's the largest vein I 've ever seen . Yeah , it supplies blood to my leg . It lets me move faster , run away . Obviously it needs to be bigger . It needs to be smaller . Everything smaller , lighter . Otherwise you 'll never be able to shift your gravity center . I wouldn 't need to shift my damn gravity center if it wasn 't for you . What happened between you and the Grudeks ? Why did you run away ? I don 't think that is anything you need to know . Sputnik , we don 't work together , we die . That 's all the need-to-know I need to know . I was ... too good . A simple Leviathan travel route was all they expected . By finding the Sacred Burial Space , with mature toubray flesh , I ... I sabotaged myself . Right , they didn 't want you to tell anybody . My loss counts as breach . They won 't even have to pay fees to my organization . Somebody sign that contract . Kinda ' makes me wanna kill you myself . I think if you wait , they will do that for you . We climb two levels higher and begin searching anew . How do you know they 'll come this way ? The lights are still on . The air is still circulating . They have not found the Y 'tal cavity yet . The what ? The richest , most prized toubray comes from Leviathan 's very first neural cell . Defleshing it shorts out everything else . 1812 , gun . This is a very nice profession you 've chosen . Thank you . The conductivity tests indicate upper quadrant . Warlord , this next location brings us much closer . Ambush time . Stay quiet . Crichton ? I know you 're here . Rygel and I are staring at your pewnkah module ... - Shh ! in this wreck of a Maintenance Bay ? Crichton ! Where 's Moya ? Turn it off . Where are you ? Center Chamber , as I recall . No exit ! They know we 're here . Oh , nothing gets by you , does it ? Wait . Sikozu Shanu . Warlord Ilkog . I seek your tolerance with a pledge never to tell anyone about this place . As certain ... when you are dead . Now , I know that once you had an amnesty , you were going to mention my name , right ? Grudeks , wait ! Your , uh ... earlier offer ? The " run away " program . We 'll take it . Grudeks , when they reach the corner , all fire as one . 1812 ! This way ! Shoot them ! If Psycho-zoo let these slijnots aboard , then why are we keeping her alive ? Pip , cut her some slack . She just had her hand ripped off . And you haven 't seen Moya ? I told ya , Sparky . She got swallowed . Well , our pod 's not going anywhere . We were lucky to get this far . Chiana . What the hell 's the matter with you ? With me ? Yeah , you . What 's the matter with me ? - You . Hey Ryg , how ' bout you tell Crichton what 's the matter with me ? Why are you shaving now ? You 're what 's the matter with me , Crichton . You . Always ... you . An unprecedented reward is offered for information leading dead or alive price of five million currency pledges rests on the Nebari Chiana , who was last seen ... They 're everywhere . In every bar , every port , every ship that can fly . Hey ! We had nowhere to go but here . And all because of you . I 'm worth seven million . That 's frelling with her head , too . Hey , Toad ! Why are you shaving now ? I finally figured out wormholes . You did it ? All that wormhole nonsense we put up with ? Yeah , I can get you home . If I knew where home was . Or where we are . Or where the wormhole network is . Yeah , and if we weren 't trapped with only two weapons , about to die . Well , good new is , who better to save a Leviathan than us , huh ? Hmm ! So , we stay away from doggie , we find the Grudeks and we bring them down . So . Go get it . Yeah , she says her flesh will rebond . So Ryg , you go fetch her hand . Pip , you 're with me . Why me ? Severed heads , severed hands . It 's a motif . Get rid of the animal . How hard can that be ? You saw Sikozu 's hand , or lack thereof ? Yeah , and I saw her . Don 't confuse us . Hey ! All right , let 's talk about it . Whatever it is . You know th-those visions I was having ? Yeah . - Yeah , well they evolved . Into what ? There 's a ... there 's a cheat proof game at the casinos . A ... A mercury droplet , it bounces off an ion stream . And there 's a thousand different outcomes . - Whatever . You 've won ? Seven times . In a row . They arrested me , they took my winnings ... They ... they had a little fun and ... and a little torture . Nothing ... nothing new . On the upside , you 're not crazy . You see the future . That 's what 's so weird . I ... I see the present . Only it 's just so ... it ... it slows down . So , what 's the bad ? Blinding headaches afterwards . It 's ... It 's like my eyes , they ... they get all used up , and I ... I can 't see . And ... and ... and each time it happens , it ... it lasts longer . We get out of here , we find someone to fix it . Before then , we got to find a way to screw the pooch . Now , I 'm going to need a rope , a rabbit and a membrane . Ropes are mine . Rest is yours . Crichton , I 'm as near as I can get . They 're still down here . Grudek ! This cell is not Y 'tal ! But we are near ! Up one , over one ! There it is . That 's a Crichton kick . Boy . Yeah , girls do kick harder . Uh ... maybe it 's not mine at all . You just won 't let that rest , will you ? Ah , maybe it 's got a little ponytail and a teeny-tiny goatee . Maybe . - Maybe it has half a metal face on it . Maybe . - Maybe it 's a royal pain in the ass , eats all the time and farts a lot . Then we 'll know it 's yours . Aw , no ... that 's a Crichton kick . Huh , still obsessed , I see . I 'm not obsessed . Did she say anything to you before she left ? Goodbye , good luck , good riddance . That 's what you said . And I 'm not obsessed . Oh , wormholes , Aeryn , Earth Aeryn , Scorpius , Aeryn ... I 'm out of fingers . Want me to keep counting on hers ? Aeryn ... She say anything to you before she left ? Oh , Crichton ! For once , listen . When a woman , whether she 's your wife , your lover or a slave you 've purchased to be your wife or lover , leaves you repeatedly , take a hint . Well , that was the plan , but ... you know how my plans go . The bargain is struck . Can 't say I 'm surprised . You have ruined it . Enough . Enough ! Look at what she did ! - Look what she did ! Back ! Freaky made a deal with rotting flesh over there , and he tried to kill me . Because she shot at him first ! You see what that is ? You know what that is ? Come on . Tell me . Crindars . Scarran currency . You betcha . And you know , you know where he got it from ? Her . Nebari , Hynerian and you . All from the Peacekeeper realm . What kind of currency do you have in your pocket ? ! Pip , you think she 's a Scarran ? No , of course I 'm not . I 'm Kalish and we hate the Scarran but I did grow up in their territory , yes . So , uh , what was the plan ? This . Bloodless . I bet you know what that is , too . It 's a Nebular Pod for a flight racer . He liked me . I bought us an escape vehicle . After they left , he was going to leave his ship behind so we could live . They have found the Y 'tal Cavity . This ship will be dead soon . Us shortly thereafter . So , what was your plan ? - An open hatchway . - Why aren 't we sucked out ? Ask her . The Pilot is using the Leviathan 's mass to generate an electrostatic membrane . One puncture and va-vooosh ! That 's totally insane . You did not run into the Brindz Hound . We will never get close enough to stop them while it is loose . And that means they 're harvesting toubray now . You guys , go find the Slaughterhouse Five . Make sure we 're ready to move . I 'm not going with her . Pip . - Please . She knows Leviathans better than we do . All right , you go first , in case I have to shoot you . I 'll keep Pilot alert . Oh no , Sparky . She 's fine . You got a job . You ever hear of " rabbit to the hound " ? All right , we should split up . Wait , you go ... Chiana , I told you I can go places you cannot . I 'd love to send you to one myself . the hallmark of the subeducated . The only hallmark you 're going to be is a small , small smudge in the wall after I shoot you . I told you ... I can go places you cannot . Oh , he has absolutely no appreciation of my worth in a crisis . Let him find his own frelling hound . It 's beautiful . You 're Picasso . All right , I want you to go hide . Run away . It 's gonna be ugly . You don 't wanna see this . It 's dinner time . Come see the tasty human goat , staked out like an idiot . Whoa ! You wanted him , you got him ! What 's the matter ? You not hungry ? Red Rover , Red Rover , send Cujo right over . Come on , little buddy ! Come on , doggie . Damn you . Come on . Come on , come on . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Want some of this ? Yeah . Grade A prime American beef . Come on ! Come on , damn you ! What the hell is your problem ? Can 't even hit a door . Come on ! Come on , baby , bring it on ! Yeah , you know you want some of this . Come on ! Whoo ! Right here , right here , right now . Oh ! Oh ! Damn ! Oh , man ! Door , door , door , door , door ! Thanks . Now that was a plan . Enterprising , you are . Expecting you I have been . What to do now ? You know , Sikozu ... a chance you took to come here . Understand . By contracting for my service , I am forbidden to reveal anything . The pathetic bearded one must offer little hope for you to risk my mercy . Highly ineffective , but he will fight . We will be gone before they can reach us . My worries now are few . I hope I am not one of them . Go back . Divert them astray . When we withdraw , I shall honor your contribution and take you with us . Thank you , Warlord . My blessings . You 're not exactly a team player , are you ? Don 't worry , I 'm not going to hurt you . Told Chiana she could do that . All right , here 's the deal . We 're going to be really , really quiet so the Pirates of the Caribbean don 't hear us , okay ? Pilot , tell Miss Booksmart here how many kids you got . Six before I was joined with Elack . You 're a mommy-killer . How does that make you feel ? I do not choose my assignments . I simply follow orders . Follow orders ? I thought you were smart . You can 't come up with something better than that ? I studied harder than you could imagine . I sacrificed more than you will ever attain . Do not presume to moralize with your narrow perspective . Hey . Listen to what Pilot intercepted . Returning to retrieve you now , Warlord . No other suitable Leviathans found . Grudeks , was the message sent ? Her employers are aware Sikozu 's own errors in judgment cost her her life . Welcome to the universe . No . No , that 's ... that 's not fair . That 's not right . I will not have my reputation tainted by a negative report . Allow me to give you another narrow perspective . Your options are limited . So you can either help or we 're gonna truss you up like a Christmas turkey and dump you in the bilge . Do I have another option ? No . You have to resist shooting at them . - Yes , I got it . If the hoses are ruptured in the wrong order you 'll create an ... air fuel bomb that will destroy the whole ship . Yes . Chiana , you don 't have to do this if you don 't want to . I said I would , Crichton . Just go . Yeah , but if you don 't wanna ... Oh , for yotz sake ! She gets more blind from drinking raslik . All right , by popular demand . All right , when Chiana gets up here , she comes off , bucket of bolts goes on . It 's a zip . All right , Pip . Your call . Let 's fly . - Warlord Ilkog ! - What ? - He was falling . - Where ? There , I swear an oath . What is that ? I 'm blind . Just ... just lights and shapes . Get her down . Tell me about the hoses . White . Far right . White hose . Some kind of mist . Frozen hydrogen drixoride . In the center , orange welding pipe . Black jackhammer on the left . Where 's your frelling arm ? ! Stop spinning and reach for it . What 's the order ? Right , left , center . No deviation . Hydrogen first , right ? Then adding the jackhammer 's pressurized brontium should prevent the explosion from being catastrophic . Light it up with the welder . No , not my hand ! Oh ! You rajnot ! No . No , no ! No ! No ! 1812 ! Covering fire ! Damn it , covering fire ! Fire , you frelnik ! Fire ! Left , right , center ... No , right , left , center . Oh , trat , trat , trat ! Right . Left . Center . Whoo ! Yeah ! Yeah , come on , baby , yeah . Please , baby , please , baby , please , baby please , baby , please . Rygel ! Do not drop my hand . Oh , why am I bothering ? I got ya . I got ya . I ... Oh . I tried . Rygel , you bastard ! I tried . Oh , dren . No Pilot muerta . No Crichton muerta . All right , here 's the thing . You might not want to come with us . We are not the best traveling companions . I am going to get my life back . I will not end up like you . Okay . I hate that you 're doing this . The returning Grudek ship would 've destroyed us if we hadn 't left the Sacred Space . And we would like to repay our debt before we pass . You don 't owe us anything . Nevertheless . If we are able , you shall arrive at the planet where you think your friends may be . It was your dream , yours and Elack 's to die there . No dream is guaranteed , Commander . The grace of age is we , we learn to accept . I 'm not coming here anymore . Why not ? Doesn 't change anything . And it makes me sad . Hmm . So what 's next ? What 's left ? Wormholes . I gotta recreate a ton of equations . The new girl smashed ' em up . Oh , new . New is good . Not always . Hey , babe . - Thanks . Who 's this ? Um ... No one .

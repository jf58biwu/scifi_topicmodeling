You don 't have to go that far . It is my duty to do so . I advise you not to . I 'll be fine . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay ... It 's okay ... I feel a bit out of it ... Why are you dressed ? Don 't hide your flesh from me ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ... What else could I do ? Huh ? Was there any other option ? Will I be convicted ? Who knows . That means ... Professor Viblio Sawatsukumori killed the prisoner ? This is Surveillance Bureau Head Quarters . Answer the call if you hear me . Answer the call if you hear me . This is Surveillance Bureau Head Quarters . Hurry , help us out of here . Hello ? Come and get us out of here ! They can 't hear us . Report the condition State your name and your post . Hello , can you hear us ? State your name and your post . There are dead people in here ! Give it to me ! State your name and your post . How should I know ! State your name and your post . Give it ! This is Mochizuki . This is Mochizuki . Can you hear me ? Let go ! We can hear you but there 's no visual . Can the crew report the situation ? We can hear you but there 's no visual . Can the crew report the situation ? Please report the situation immediately . Shut up ! Shut up , shut up ! Now , listen to me ! Explain that I didn 't kill him . I beg you . Please !

Listen . This is from me . Don 't say that I killed him . Oh , and ... Here , this ... You have done a lot for us . This is for you . Take it , it 's yours . You must understand . I don 't want your money ! I don 't want it ! Just listen to me ... You know , I think you should receive it from him as a gift . No ! Well , it was just an accident . A mishap ! A mishap ! And it 's a reward for that . It 's a reward . That 's right . That 's it ... What ? Everybody , listen to me . Please testify that I 'm innocent . The prisoner was so ashamed of himself that he committed suicide . How 's that ? And beat himself to death ? Small details can be easily ignored . Especially with these few members . We all received our rewards so let 's do what we can . I 'm a microbiologist taking part in a national project in Avetojexi . I can 't jeopardize that with this problem . So you must understand . Without me , the project will go nowhere . You see ? It 's getting hot here . Thanks . Pay up . Nonsense ! That 's ridiculous . I 've got some milk but I can 't let you have it all . It 's for the baby . So , you wanna buy some milk ? Is that so . I 'll tell the truth . Hey , will you share some of your milk with this man ? That 's enough . The rest is the baby 's . Let 's get back to the subject . The girl 's cigarette butt was found today at the site of the explosion . She says that the latter incident was just self-defence . Hey . Don 't smoke . It 's badly ventilated here . What now ? Hey ... Hey . What is it ? What is it ? What are you doing ? Hey . You ! What 's wrong ? Um ... The carriage . No way . Come on . Hey ... Lend me your baby carriage . Leave it alone ! That 's it ! I 've had enough of you ! Shut up , bitch . What 's your problem ? We might not be able to get out of here with all this mess ! We might , though . Shut up ! But that 's all your fault ! Don 't hit me ! It 's not all my fault ! Hey you two ... Where 's the baby ? I don 't know ... I don 't know ! Who cares if she 's been lying or not . Where is your baby ? Do you have something to drink ? What 's wrong with you ? Stop it ! Hey . Stop it . You 're irritating . Luchino . I 've been waiting for you . Dad ... Where were you ? You got me worried . Come and sit here . You look like your mom now . Drink up . Hey . Hey ! Hey ! You okay ? It 's sedatives . You need it . You don 't like drugs ? It 's best that you stay calm , for all of us . What 's wrong with you ? Did you notice ? Don 't look at me . They 'll know . Who are you ? I 'm a secret agent from the Surveillance Bureau . Don 't worry . I 'm not after you . I 'll let you walk away with those cigarettes and the murder of that prisoner . But , you have to stay calm from now on . Did you see the bottle ? I did . Impressive ! It took me years of practice to reach your level . What was it ? It 's a bottled embryo contaminated by a killer virus . Virus ? It 's a biological weapon he created . He 's an anti-government terrorist . That money will fund their activities . The money and virus are for the terrorists . Don 't go in any further . He has some ability to sense incoming powers . Can 't you hear me ? He 'll know it 's you ! You can 't read my mind ' cause I 'm blocking it from you . I knew that you could go into people 's minds from the start . I have to keep a low profile to keep things less complicated . Just don 't move . His allies will be here soon . His allies ... Is something wrong ? They 're here ! At last ! Hey ! I 'm here ! Help me out ! Come here , quick ! Hey ! Hey ! I can 't hear you ? A Surveillance official ? He 's dead . What ? There 's another one ? You 're betraying me ? Wait ! What 's gonna happen to me ? Nonsense ! Who the hell do you think I am ? I 've worked for the organization for 12 years ! Because I killed ? But that was self-defence ! Are you abandoning me ? You 're eliminating me ? Wait , we 're not finished here ... It 's over ... It 's over . It was my best work . Who would give it to you ? He 's opening the bottle ! Shit ! Luchino ... Stop it ... Stop it ! Stop it ! Don 't move ! Arrest her . What the ... What happened here ? Call the medical team ! Dead bodies everywhere ... This is Special Disposition Group 12 . Can you hear me ? Do you copy ? Latest news on the explosion ... Due to poor management of the fuel transport 113 deaths have been confirmed so far . The fire covered Level 138 of South Terminal 8 at one point but restoration is now taking place despite the smouldering in certain areas . 15 transport elevators went missing due to this fire but the government states that they were all located before dawn . In connection with this incident at the same terminal a 17 year old female has been arrested for the slaughter in the elevator ... It 's from yesterday 's news . Can you take those off ? Luchino Fujisaki states that she stabbed the professor for you . Officer ... I told you . I was just sitting down . Why won 't you believe me ? I never spoke a word with her ! She says you are both telepathic . She 's crazy . I heard that she was in a mental hospital before . I don 't think she should be roaming about the city to begin with . Right ? So you were pushed by Professor Sawatsukumori ? Yes . I really am a victim . My wife just went out to buy our breakfast . She goes to this nice bakery in Licovatosigo twice a week . Yeah ... They bake great breads there . Do you have any idea why Luchino stabbed the professor ? No . But she went insane several times so I guess she just became crazy . Did the Professor harm her like he harmed you ? Well , I wasn 't looking , so ... But she suddenly started stabbing him when he took the bottle in his hands . With the capsules in it ? Yes , what was it ? That was for his heart . He had some trouble with it . Could you ... Do you want it on ? No , thank you . Doctor , your responsibility as her psychiatrist is in question here . Luchino Fujisaki was cured . There 's no doubt about that . Your decision could have been wrong . She stabbed her father to death three years ago . Is that correct ? Yes . She 's been in and out of your hospital since then . We can prove that you were with her when she was smoking that morning . I was just warning her about that , but the agent came and ... He states that you obstructed the arrest and let her escape . No ! I was desperately trying to stop him from shooting her . Well , that is not our problem here . Why did you discharge her from the hospital ? She was recovered . She was able to lead a normal life . But you can hardly call things normal in that elevator . Even if she did become insane in that situation there 's nothing we could do . Doctor , are you saying that with respect to all the incidents caused by Luchino Fujisaki the hospital holds no responsibility for her crime ? At least I 'm not responsible ...

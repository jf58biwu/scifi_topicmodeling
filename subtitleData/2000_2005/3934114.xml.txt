 Why do I always feel like I 'm looking in the wrong direction ? The wind is gone . That 's it for today . I 'm beginning to think Veronica will return to us on foot . She helped me construct that balloon . Although it will be difficult to fly without hydrogen gas , I 'm sure she 'll find a way to convert it to hot air . Attention Harrod shoppers . There 's a sale on new shirts today . Yes , and ore samples galore from that new Zanga copper mine . - Challenger ! - Malone ! They left a note . Hope the trading trip went well . Don 't tell me . Gone to the eastern clearing . Can you blame Malone ? All he does these days is watch the skies for Veronica . Well , surely we owe her that much , Without Veronica 's tree house and her parents ' supplies , why we 'd ... we 'd be wearing raptor skins , living in caves , and conversing with grunts . What makes you think that 's not how you boys communicate now ? You know , flying observation balloons in the world was a lot like this . Waiting and watching for hours , days , followed by 5 minutes of ... sheer terror when the bombardments began . Well that 's war for you , whether it 's by land , sea , or air . You know , that 's something we 've never talked about . What did you do during the Great War ? I tried to join the Navy . But the Admiralty felt I 'd be more valuable ... pursuing scientific advancements . Bound as I am by the Official Secrets Act , I can 't tell you any more . What about Roxton ? Did he ever tell you what he did in the war ? In fairness to Roxton , I think that 's a question for him , don 't you ? I get the feeling he doesn 't want to talk about it at least not to me . Well , I think even you may have had experiences ... during the war that you don 't want to talk about . It 's a blow dart ! Where did that come from ? There ! Malone ! - Gunshot ! - Someone is in trouble ! - Take cover ! - Good idea . that must be the poison . Keep down ! Keep down ! Whatever you say , Sergeant . Get up , Malone ! Make for the trees . Whatever you say , Sergeant . Got to get to the trench ! Trench ? Come on you two , move ! move ! No ! no ! Get over there . Go , go , go ! No ! NO ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Snap out of it , lad ! lad ? - Are you with us ? - Sergeant . - That 's better . - What happens now ? It 's too soon to tell , lad . Morning , sergeant Haskell ! lovely day for a picnic ! That 's enough out of you . what did you see ? Enemy patrol , broken through the line , maybe 20 to 25 in all . Should be a walk in the park ! we 're not here as soldiers today we 're here as nannies for the journalists . We 'll pull back and let the artillery take care of the patrol . Did you hear that , lad ? we 're pulling back to command . Up you get , lad ! What about this man ? we can 't just leave him ! You wanted to see some action , so welcome to it . The burial teams will take care of the private. let 's go . I 'm sorry . Sorry . The sergeant says I 've got to go . - Come on ! - Malone ? What is it , John ? - Something moving in those trees . - Raptors ? No , raptors would make more noise . - Ah , gotcha ! - What ? Who ? Do you think that 's who Challenger and Malone ran into ? I certainly hope not , I don 't like the looks of those blow pipes ! Sergeant Haskell ! I didn 't hear you ! I didn 't hear you ! Sounds like some of our lads have run into that enemy patrol - Shouldn 't we help them ? - There 's no turning back now , lad . You 're in it now , up to your neck , just like you wanted . Just keep telling yourself , it 's a lovely day for a picnic . Eventually you 'll believe it . - Challenger ! - Malone ! Keep walking , eyes front . I thought we scared off whoever was watching us . We are not so lucky . At least two to the right , one to the left . Likely more . What are they waiting for ? An invitation to tea ? I wish ! We 'll just have to work out a way to ... discourage our new found friends . My thoughts exactly . I 'll go ahead , you fall back , Whoever is watching us will have to split their attack and we 'll set up a crossfire . Why , Marguerite ! I am impressed . Two years on the plateau have certainly honed your tactical skills ! The plateau has got nothing to do with it . When I was a child running off in two directions ... was how my friends and I evaded the gendarmes in Paris . Why , may I ask , were you running from the police in Paris ? Because I didn 't want them to catch me . Three to the right , one to the left ? Likely more , I said . So much for establishing a crossfire . Oh , this isn 't good . Alkaloid concentrate . First it knocks you out and then it kills you . Maybe we can make them sit on their own darts . Poetic justice . Unfortunately , that wouldn 't do any good . Killers that hunt with this kind of poison carry an antidote ... in case of accidental exposure . So much for my wishful thinking . So , what other tactics did ... you use to avoid the Parisian police ? Bribes were effective . What ? Outrunning the police , offering bribes ! What on earth were you doing in Paris ! I was trying to survive . Which is what we should be doing right now . In case ... you hadn 't noticed , they 're surrounding us . All right . I 'll hold them here . You go through the jungle . I 'm not leaving you behind . Staged withdrawal , Marguerite . I 'll cover you and you cover me . If we both make a run for it we 'll end up with darts in our backs . - I 'll see you in the clearing ? - Of course . Move , move ! Let 's down . Stay low ! Wouldn 't we be safer in the trenches ? We 'd be safer back in Brighton beach Just for that , private , you take the advance . See ya around , yank . Remember to spell my name right . There 's a sniper out there ! How 's the weather , Rutherford ? Should have brought my brolly , sergeant ! Brolly . That 's an umbrella to you , yank . I know . Private Jones , give Rutherford a hand , would ya ? But there 's a sniper out there ! Who will surely kill us , unless we kill him first . Here 's your brolly , Rutherford ! Clear ! Come on , lad , now it 's safer in the trench . Come on , go . - You could have been killed ! - Isn 't that what you 're here for ? Think of the stories you could have written , the newspapers you could have sold . And we spoiled it for you , by not having our heads shot off . - I believe we owe you an apology . - That 's enough . We 've still got a few miles to go before we reach command . Now are you sure you 're going to bear up ? I 'll be fine . None of us is fine , lad , pay attention . Now we need to find a place to rest . Jones , it 's your turn to scout about . check it out like a good lad . If you see any frauleins , tell them not to settle for you . Cause I 'm worth waiting for ! Get stuff I 'm not doing this to sell newspapers . Then why are you here ? You slippery little devils have finally come to your senses ! Only one winner when blow darts go up against my Webley 45s . That 's close enough ! John ! I gave you fair warning . Well , come on ! I 'm ready for you ! NO ! Come back here ! I haven 't finished with you yet ! Oh , thank God ! You 'd better be right about them always carrying the antidote . All right ? - Looks clear ! - Good ! Not the day you had in mind , is it ? What do you mean ? As I recall we were to give you a tour of these old trenches ... where the front used to be . I was given strict orders to keep you away from the front . but the front came to you ! I guess war never turns out the way it is supposed to . Nothing does , lad . The sooner we realize that , the more bearable life is . Mortar ! That 's all right , lad . We 're all afraid . Accept it . - Use it . - I 'm not afraid just startled . I 'll take over for a while . The sergeant giving you a hard time , is he , yank ? - Not really . - Pity . He 's been giving me a hard time the last two years . Thanks to him , I 'm still alive . You want a good story , yank , write about the sergeant . Sergeant , the trench cuts close to the forest about a thousand yards along . The trees should be safer cover . Oh , good , of this sun is ruining my complexion . Rutherford ! your turn ! Unless you 'd rather to give it a try ? on the spot research for whatever you 're writing ? I 've never fired a gun . Lucky you , yank . Private Rutherford ! Right you are , sergeant . Let me just ... Down ! Rutherford ! Lad ! He took my place ! The enemy knows we 're here . Their mortars have our range . We must move on . We must move on . Lad ! Please let this be all right , That 's it , my love ! What did you just say , Marguerite ? Nothing , Nothing . You must have been dreaming . - Blow darts ? - Two . Definitely poisonous . Well , you must have been paying attention ... when I told you about the antidote . Well , occasionally you do say something worth listening to . I could say the same thing about you . John , what if Challenger and Malone were hit by those darts ? Then we don 't have much time . Here . Artillery has stopped , that 's a good sign . Unless it means the place is crawling with enemy soldiers , and they don 't want to hit their own . You go to school to become a journalist ? Columbia . New York . So what would your finely educated mind suggest we do ? Should we take our chances in the trenches ? or ... would that forest be a safer bet ? Well , in the trenches we can 't see who 's coming for us . At least with the trees for cover , we can see all directions . Exactly . Right . Good to have you on the team , lad ! I 'll take the advance ! What was Rutherford 's first name ? Don 't know , don 't know your name either , yank . Don 't intend to find out . Makes it easier to forget when you 're gone . Maybe that 's why I 'm here , so people won 't forget . People always forget war , that 's why we have so many of them . I won 't let them forget this one . Who are you to tell people what to remember ? You 've never even fired a gun ! Never looked a man in the eye after he 's just killed your ... best friend in the foxhole right beside you . All this war is to you is research ... for some book you 're going to write someday . I don 't need to know your name , yank , because I already know exactly who you are ! I finally got one . Get out of here , yank ! my knee 's shot , this is as far as I go . So leave ! now ! If you 're so keen to die , yank , I can save the enemy the trouble ! My name is Ned Malone ! You 're my job , yank . This whole bloody war is my job ! So go ! Tell Haskell to send ... the medics for me when you get to command . Jones ? Enemy soldier in the trench , he made me leave ! You did the right thing . But he died . For what ? So that you could live ! Now you 're going to pull yourself together ... and you 're going to give these soldiers the respect that they are due ! How ? By living your life as if it means something ! Now we are going deep into that forest . We 're going to find a safe place to wait until our lads ... drive off that enemy patrol . Step lively ! And take the safety off ! Watch your step , lad , seems we 've got company . Looks like a courier ! His plane must have been shot down and his parachute failed ... bad luck for him good news for us . I can 't make out much of it , but these are ... troop movement orders dated for ... three days from now ! They are planning a new offensive and these orders tell us ... when and where . Looks like we won 't be finding a place to wait after all . These documents could save hundreds of lives , possibly thousands . Well , Rutherford and Jones would like that . - Did you hear something ? - No . Let 's go . Get down man . Get down , get in the cavern man . What do I do ? What do I do ? Sharpshooter ? And he 's moving closer , Never fired a gun before , have you ? - How 's your arm ? - A mills bomb ? Wait for him to reload again , pull the igniter pin . Four seconds . Four seconds . Outstanding pitch ! England could have made a damn fine cricket player out of you . The U.S. beat you to it . I 'm already a damn fine baseball player . You can circle past them . I 'm not leaving you here for them to find ! You 're only endangering yourself ! But I 'm saving you , get up ! It 's all right , sergeant . We 'll be safe in here . Roxton ! Challenger and Malone made it this far . Or at least Challenger did ... Marguerite ! He 's still breathing . Careful , careful ! Two darts Same as yours . We 're in time . He should be all right . Come on , old boy ! Ipso facto , Summerlee . You . Summerlee ? Summerlee 's not here , George . Do you know where you are ? - The plateau . - Where all roads lead , I was having this most vivid dream . I ... I was debating the existence of dinosaurs with Summerlee at ... a London Zoological Society . Ignorant buggers ! - It wasn 't a pleasant experience ! - That debate was years ago , my friend . This morning you were with Malone . Do you remember that ? Yes ! We were looking for Veronica . On our way back to the tree house , we were attacked ! There were poison darts . So join the club . Fortunately , Florence Nightingale here mixed up the antidote . So quickly ? - Courtesy of our attackers . - Oh , yes , of course . Those who hunt with poison would have an antidote . Have you administered some to Malone ? Malone was hit ? Oh yes ! In the chest very close to the heart . Well , without the antidote , even the smallest amount of poison will surely kill him by sunset ! You won 't stop the bleeding , man . You need a doctor . Too few , too far . Those soldiers you saw in the woods ? They 'll find this bunker sooner than you think . What you need to do is take these papers back to command ... so our lads are ready for the enemy advance . We 'll take them back to command together ! I gave you an order , soldier ! I 'm a civilian . Remember ? That 's right . I was supposed to protect you ... and you 're the one who nullified that sharpshooter . I didn 't nullify anything , I killed another human being . That wasn 't human , lad . That was the enemy . Don 't confuse the two . Maybe if we kept reminding ourselves that the enemy are ... people just as we are , there would be no more war ! That 's a fine and noble sentiment , and the only reason you can think that ... is because Jones and Rutherford ... and thousands of young men just like them died ... to give you that freedom ! I appreciate their sacrifice . I know they did what they had to do . But this is the twentieth century ! the time for war has passed ! Not for you it seems . You took that grenade and deliberately ... killed that sniper before he could kill you ! No ! That 's different ! You killed to save yourself and me , that 's war , lad . That 's not different at all ! Malone has definitely passed through this way . Any idea who 's been attacking us , Challenger ? They 're nomadic raiders , who steal from one tribe to trade with another . The Keeran I believe they are called . Veronica mentioned them once , but I don 't remember any details . Veronica would more than likely know everything about them . Yes . Quite revealing how we 've come to ... rely on her for information about this place . I miss her too . Someone 's there ! Listen , listen carefully ! if it 's the enemy , they 'll come at us from all sides , forming lines of oblique fire from there and over there . Take a look . It is the enemy ! where do we hide ? We don 't . We 're on the front lines now . You cover that side . We 'll form a crossfire . This will be our killing ground . Not the terms you 're used to , is it ? You 'll be fine . Whatever happens , this has to get to command . Tell me you understand . I understand . Tell me you 'll leave me behind . How can I be worth your life ? the lives of Rutherford and Jones ? That 's up to you Malone . We 've done our job . Now you do yours . You called me Malone . I don 't plan on forgetting you . Malone ! The roof ! The roof ! Damnit ! Odd how Malone 's trail is weaving all over the damn place , The poison in the dart is clearly taking its toll . That 's what I don 't understand . Those two darts knocked me right out . You too , George . Malone 's exposure to it was briefer . If the poison made you dream about an old debate in London . What if it 's had the same effect on Malone ? Dreaming about the past , and yet capable of moving about in the present . What you 're proposing is that he 's in the throes of a hypnotic ... hallucination , one that place between a state of wakefulness and sleep . By all reports , such hypnotic ... drug reactions are indistinguishable from reality . It 's a very unique theory you 're proposing , Marguerite . What 's Malone going to relieve , I wonder ? A racy Christmas party in Chicago ? Or the ... thrill of a college fraternity scavenger hunt perhaps ? As a matter of fact , he and I were talking about our ... experiences during the Great War this morning . Come on , George . From what I understand , he 's a ... wet-behind-the-ears reporter . Or green as . Who rode around in observation balloons , well out of harm 's way . No . From what he said , something else happened to him . Oh yes . I 'm sure of it . - Was that a ... - A gunshot . And not a long way off , From over there ! Malone ! I won 't forget you either ... any of you , It 's time to do my job . Now , you 're going to help me . - Where 's that coming from ? - Over there . We 'd better hurry . Malone can 't last much longer without the antidote . I didn 't start this war , but I swear , I 'm going to finish it ! - Malone ! - Malone ! Where are you ? Only one of us gets out of here , and it 's not going to be you ! - Malone ! - Malone ! I hear something in those rocks . - Malone ? - Or more raiders . Where 's there 's one , there 's always more ... maybe a whole enemy patrol . but this time , I 'm ready for you ! We found you in time . You led us on a merry old chase indeed . I 'll bet you could use a drink about now . You lousy murderers ! I 'll make you pay ! I 'll make you all pay ! They were only trying to help me ! You were right , He is hallucinating . - Malone . - Roxton , be careful ! He doesn 't know where he is or what he 's doing . I 'll kill you too ! Where are you , Malone ? Do you know where you are , Ned ? Where are you right now ? I don 't know ! I 'm lost , I have to get back to command . I am with command . I 'm Major Lord John Roxton . Do you know me ? No no , I 'm just a correspondent . But I have to report ! The enemy is planning a major offensive in three days ! I found these papers ! And then Rutherford died . And then Jones . Sergeant Haskell , he died too . Everybody died , Major ! They all died for me ! Do you know what that feels like ? Yes ! Too well . But I 'm not worth it . Those brave men thought you were ... And let no man say you 're not ! Marguerite ! It all seemed so real . The poison on those darts did have a very powerful effect . As did those events you went through six long years ago . So powerful I tried to suppress them . When I think about it now , that 's why I started reporting for the Balloon Observer Corps , to rise above the war . Above the bullets and the stink , the terrible useless waste of it all . That war is over . And the documents you found did help the British to stop an offensive . A single battle averted , in a war that continued for two more years , costing hundreds of thousands more lives ... and I survived . We all played a part in that war , Malone . We all survived . Well , you 're just sitting there like a lump . What 's your story ? Ah , Malone may we have a word please , on the balcony ? I think we should talk . I 'd like to tell you what I did in a war to end all wars . It 's long past the time those two had this talk , I believe they have a lot more in common , than they think . So you 've been there too . They 're not the only ones . Malone ! How about some coffee ! I ground the beans myself , especially for you . Malone ! He 's probably sleeping off the effects of that dart . Or the port , Ned ! A note . I knew this was coming . What was coming ? What does it say ? - He 's left us , hasn 't he ? - What ? Left us ? To go where ? ! Why ? To find what he 's looking for , A way home ? That 's all any of us have been looking for , for the past two and a half years . Not Malone . I swear ! If this exodus doesn 't stop , I 'll be the only one here ! Marguerite , this isn 't going to last forever , When the time is right , he 'll come back . My friends , I don 't want to upset you . Get to the point , Malone ! I treasure your friendship blah , blah , blah ... Veronica . Here we go . All my life I 've looked for answers in ... other people 's stories , their experiences , their thoughts , what they learned ... Somehow , I ... never looked for those answers in myself . But the soldiers I met in the war , they knew what I didn 't , that we can only face death if we know what it means to be alive . The strangest thing is , I think the plateau is like our lives . We 've been spending all our time trying to get home , without realizing that no matter where we find ourselves , the point of our lives might just be the journey , not the destination . Whatever the answers that await me , today is the day my journey , my story , truly begins . *

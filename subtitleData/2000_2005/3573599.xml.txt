 Here ... It 's here . 31 to 36 I don 't get why we aren 't going first class . The state is paying , anyway . But it isn 't . The university lays out the money . That 's why . I want the window seat or I 'll feel sick . When will we arrive ? - I said " When will we get there ? " - 7 AM tomorrow morning . We 've been assigned a car from the Telco Agency which we can use for the final 125 miles . Damn it , Marcus ! Be careful ! - They believe it 's a pyromaniac who started the fire ? - They don 't know that for sure ... Pyromaniac ? There 's no pyromaniac there . There 's hardly any people at all up there . What 's the nearest town , then ? Well ... " Lapp-ja-vaara-la-jukk-maja ... " Hey guys , you need to stop with that attitude . We are representing an authority . We must try to behave a little . Nearest town is called Vatjinerva . - Vatjinerva ? - Yes , that is what it 's called . There , we 'll shop for food to last a week . When the food is finished , we 'll go back and resupply . That 's what the routine will be . Take it easy , Tomas . You don 't have to pretend to be the colonel . Exactly ... Who said you were in charge ? - Kjell-Åke said it . - Nah . Tomas ! Kjell-Åke said that it was good we helped the Nature Conservation Authority with this . That you were in charge , I think you made up yourself . DAY 1 Are we getting there soon ? Look , there it is ! Hell , guys ! This wasn 't that bad , was it ? - Looks like an old wreck . - Yep - No . They 'd better ... . Damn it ! - What ? They 've locked it ? - Oh no ! - They locked it ! - No . No . The key should be on the tire , they said . - What tire ? Who said that ? - Well , Lasse from the Nature Conservation Authority - Well ? - He called . I forgot to tell you . And I 'm just hearing this now ... Thanks ! I 'm dying for a smoke . OK - Damn ! - Sure looks like a big place . This won 't do . Some of us have to use a tent . - I feel like looking around . Anyone want to join me ? - Yes me . No . Wait . Not now . We 'll get ready here first . See that everything works . - You are such a bore . We 'll just look around a little . - Honestly . If we 're going to stay here for three weeks we must have some damn structure . - Stop talking like that . - I was thinking we could go look around ... - Yes ! Come here . Tomas ! The other way . Of course , I knew that ! I was just checking on something . - So glad you joined us , Tomas . - " Must have structure " ... haha Shut up ! Fuck me ! Reportedly , 800 acres burned , and nobody knows for how long . - 800 ! - Must have been spectacular ! ... and hot , in particular ! God , how amazing ! - It seems so unreal ... - And in 20 years you 'd never know there was a fire here . Right ... - Did you think it over , about Christmas ? - No . I haven 't had time . Mom and Dad would really love to meet you , you know . And it is just for one day . - They would be so happy . - I think Christmas would be so formal . Can 't we just forget about Christmas and go to Thailand instead ? We could have coffee at your parents ' on a Sunday , instead ? - Coffee ? - Yes . Isn 't that enough ? Do we need to celebrate Christmas with them ? No . Not if you don 't want to ... . Jacob ... I 'm engaged to you . Can 't we go from there ? ... and we 'll meet the family afterwards . OK ? OK . Come on , guys ! We 've got to get back and put up the tent now . Could someone come help me ? - Sure . I can help . - OK Come on ! Ann-Sofie ... Hey you ! Hey you ! It 's OK ... . Of course it 's OK ... But it 's not OK to just ignore the family . - No , sure . We won 't ditch the family ... - No . I love families ! I really do . I love you ! - ... and my relatives ! - Come on ... - Yeah , wait for me . - What are you doing ? - It 's just a trick I learned at the agriculture school . to check for peat fire ... But it seems cool . There is no glow . - Ow ! - Haha . That 's another trick ! Fuck ! I was supposed to call Kjell-Åke when we got here , but I have no signal . There 's no coverage up here , I bet . I guess I 'll call when we go shopping then ... Ingar , I really have to ask ... How the hell could you be together with Tomas for five years ? More than five years ! - It 's a fucking mystery . - Jacob ... that 's her business ... Oh , excuse me ! I was just wondering ... Must 've been like being engaged to a log . Thank you . Nah , he 's only like that when he 's nervous . Plus , I 'm here now too ... In fact , Tomas is really nice , if he could just loosen up a bit . How does the Nature Conservatory Department want the classifications ? By species . From insects to spore plants . Every fucking thing . What about toilets ? We 're supposed to use the one in the trailer ? No , it doesn 't work . I guess it 'll be God 's beautiful nature ... that 'll stroke your ass every morning . - Oh no ! Look over here ! What 's this ? - Isn 't it a burnt animal ? - If it is , it 's a very rare one ... - It 's very hard to tell what it might have been . - It 's quite soft . - Looks like ... . some kind of fetus . - Right ... because there 's the eye . - Or ... - So what should we carry it in ? - What ? Well , we 'll have to bring it back to camp to check what it is . - No , it 's just an animal . Let it be . - This must have been ... - " Only an animal ? " Look ! - ... a heart . Ann-Sofie , please find something to carry it in . - No , I ... - Look here ! - Please ! - No ! Well , OK then . Thanks . Look there too ... One , two , three ! One , two , three ! - You flooded it . - Fuck it . I didn 't flood it . But I hear it . It needs more fuel , I say . One , two , three ... One , two , three ... - Hi , Ann-Sofie ! - So you got the tent up . Nice . - Yeah , no biggie . - Where are Jacob and Ingar ? I need some kind of bucket . Jacob found a dead animal that he wants to bring here . - A dead animal ? - Yeah , it 's fucking disgusting , so I need a plastic bin , or bucket or ... I know . Use the cooler in the trailer . No , we 've got the meat in there . Use something else . We 're gonna grill the meat in an hour . It 'll stay fresh , don 't worry . - Here we go . One , two , three ... - Just great ! - Try to make it snappy , Ann-Sofie . - Later ! One , two , three ! - OK . You can handle it yourself , then . - But I haven 't said anything ... - But you 're looking at me like you know everything . - Have you checked ... Yes , I checked ... Stop ! Don 't poke there . - And why not ? - Because that 's not the problem . You just need to pull more . Stand back ! Let 's use this ... Oh , another forest fire ? - Have you seen the spices ? - Over here . - Uh-uh , I 'm taking these away . - This is nice . I never made a fire this big when I was a kid . I believe you . - Watch it ! - It 's cool . Fire is attracted to me . - Fiery person . - Yup . Passionate ! - I bet you don 't have any more meat ? - No . I bought 5 pieces . I thought that 'd be enough . - Considering we have 5 people ... - It 's just that I 'm kinda hungry , but ... - But we have potatoes and salad . - I know . - Fuck that thing , Marcus ! We 're eating now . - Coming . I just want to try a couple more times . - Can I have some more wine , please ? - Yes ! - The hell with that , Marcus ! Come sit down ! Coming ! Hurray ! - Wonderful , Marcus ! - Cheers ! - Damn , you 're good ! - Sometimes I feel in love with myself . Is that strange ? - A bit strange , maybe ... - Do you have plenty of smokes ? - I 've got 40 packs . Do you want one ? - Oh yes , please . - But we agreed not to smoke . - But we 're allowed to with wine . We agreed on that . - Yeah , so give me one too ... - You 're all sweaty ... Yeah , feels like it . The fire here is boiling hot . ... anyway , the worst punishment was to be reincarnated as a female Stink Bug . - No kidding , I was really traumatized from that . - " Traumatized . " Haha . " Traumatic insemination " every day . Ow ! It 's going in there ! Tomas , do you have more wine , or was it just one glass per person ? Damn , you 're eager ! Get the box . There is more if you want . - ' Traumatic insemination ' ... - S 'OK , he didn 't hear that ! - Anybody want whiskey ? - No ! - Well , of course . - Everybody except me . - Yes , a tankard for me , please . ... There came a guy from Skåne and farted a shit . and all the guys from Småland dashed there . They salted and peppered and ... and took themselves a bit . - Haha . I 'm from Småland . - You are such a typical Smålander . - Smålanders are so damn stingy . - What the fuck was that thing ? - What ? The thing you found today . In the cooler inside . Yes ! Was I right ? I told you ! 1000 crowns to the one who can guess what it is . 1000 crowns ! - OK . An alien . - Mature , Marcus . Mature . - It 's just a burnt animal . - But it didn 't smell burnt ... neither burnt nor rotten . It was quite ... clinical . - Maybe it 's not an animal . Maybe it 's a " thing . " - With teeth ? - No , I mean , maybe it 's two things . Maybe it 's an animal ... but it fused together with a tree stump , a car tire or whatever . - Haha ! Car tire . Hell yeah , anything can happen at 900 degrees Celcius ! Well , I still think it 's an alien . Terribly sorry . - You want ? - Yes , thank you ! Hello ? - Fuck , Tomas . Cut it out ! - Ingar , can you please just wait a second . - Tomas ... Stop it ! - Ingar , I just want to tell you something . What is it now ? I think about you all the time . Damn it , I can 't get you out of my head , even if I try . I 've been trying to talk to you all day , but it 's like impossible , when all ... Do you remember when we were on Gotland ? You remember what we said to each other ? - No . What ? - We said that if we ever broke up , we would still have sex , just because it was so good . - But Tomas we have talked about this ... - It was you who said it . Otherwise I 'd let it be . You said you never had sex as good as with me . Did you lie when you said that ? No . I didn 't ... but ... - Right . First of all , I have my period and ... It 's not gonna work ! Don 't you get it , Tomas . I 'm not in love with you anymore . - Are you really sure about that ? - No , I 'm not . But I still have my period . - Damn it . I hate you . - Come here . Whoops ! What 's going on here ? Oh no , a girl is about to make a historical mistake . How boring ! - Where are you going ? - Dissecting the monster . Wanna come ? - OK - " Oooooh " We 're just supposed to stick the knife in it ? Jacob , it sounds like something you 'd love to do ! - Why is it always .. ? - Come on now . Alright . No problem . Mmm ... Scalpel , nurse ! " Il proffessore " - I 'll place the cut here then ... - You could hit the appendix . OK , I 'll do it here then ... - What , is that blood ? - Nah ... Could it be ? - What the hell ? - God , it 's so pink ! I have to tape this . Marcus , where 's the camera ? - God , how slimy ! - What 's this ? - What is that black ... ? - Looks like ... - Marcus , didn 't you charge the battery ? - Yes ? - It 's dead . Shit ! Forget it . - Hey , I can take a picture instead . - Great . Do it . - So is it an animal , anyway ? - Well , it 's meat . - OK , Jacob ? - OK . - Oh shit ! - What the hell are you doing ? - Something moved in there ! - Funny ! Oh , that was very funny . Seriously . Right in the hole . Something black that stuck up . - Sure ! - I 'll take another picture , then . - Damn , how disgusting that was ... - OK ? - What the hell ? - There was something , right ? - Stop it ! Cut it out ! - OK , let 's take another picture . - OK , everybody ? - Watch carefully now . - Look then , damn it ! - Sure . - Look down there . - Look carefully . - Yeah ... - What the hell ... - What 's up ? - It 's not working . - Let me try , then . - I ... - God , how disgusting ... Now I 've collected ... damn ... test material from that too . Lid , please ! Thanks ! Now I 'm going to take a shit . Then , I want a whiskey , Tomas . And you , you go down there . I hope you plan to wash your hands , Jacob ! Well ... Party 's over . I 'm a little tired , so I 'm going to bed . - Good night , sleep well . - I 'm beat . - See you tomorrow . - I 'm going to bed , too . - When do we start tomorrow ? - Around 8 AM , I guess . That work ? - Yeah , sure . Good night ! - Good night ! - Bye ! Goodbye . Damn , that was the most horrid thing I 've ever experienced . - Ick ! - What ? " What ? " You 're still here . Did you want anything ? - Well , I want to fuck . - But you don 't get to . - Please ? - See you tomorrow . Will I get to fuck tomorrow , then ? - Good night . - Sleep well . Can you take that disgusting thing out with you ? I don 't want it in here while I 'm asleep . Thanks . - Sleep well then . - Good night . - No sex tonight , then ? - Don 't speak so soon ! You 're here . - Ah-ha ! Humour ! - Yes it was humour , Marcus . Glad you heard that . - Yeah . You never cease to amaze . - Right . Remember that , too . - Good night , and sweet dreams ! - Yeah . Good night , and sleep well . Sleep well , Ann-Sofie ! See you tomorrow ! You haven 't brushed your teeth , am I right ? No , I haven 't brushed my teeth . And if you don 't shut up , I 'll breathe on you . Actually , you 're not that boring . Maybe these weeks will be OK after all ? There is a small chance they might be OK , Marcus ... This is torture for a lonely boy . Damn . Nope . Hands on top of the blanket , Tomas . Quiet now , Marcus . Sleep well . DAY 2 - You up already ? - God , you scared me . - You 're bleeding ? - I 'm on my period , but it 's so strange ... It 's OK ... - You sure ? - Very . - You got tampons and pads ? - Yeah , I got ' em . - Breakfast in two hours then ? - Yep . - Nice . I can get some more sleep then . - I 'm sitting over here , pass me that . - Marcus , will the Yogurt last all week ? I bought seven packs : one for each day . Should be enough . - And you only bought ' King Coco ? ' - Yes ! It 's the best ! By the way , did you know it was a regular guy who invented the recipe ? It was a contest where people could submit suggestions on flavors they 'd like ... - Really ? - Oh yes , completely true . - So what did you submit ? - Tutti-Frutti ! Yeah , no really , it 's true ! I was mentioned there . - As an idiot ? - No . As some of the flavors they 'd consider in the future , thank you ! - Ingar how are you ? - I don 't know ... I 'm not hungry . - Not hungry ? Why not ? My stomach feels strange , like it 's swollen . - Can you come out with us today ? - Yes . - Sure ? - I have some Coke in the fridge . Shall I get it ? It 'll make you feel better . - OK . So what about getting started ? Let 's get something done today . - Come on . - I 'll get the equipment . - Marcus , you take care of the dishes . - Nope . - Yes , you ! - No , you . - Yes , you . - The thing in the cooler is gone . Where is it ? Markus ? Why ? I haven 't touched it . - This isn 't a damn ... - But I haven 't touched anything ! That was fucking clever , Marcus ! But I haven 't done anything ! This is just too weird ... - What ? It moved by itself ? - Probably just a wolverine or a fox took it . Nothing unusual . There . Now it doesn 't exist any more . We don 't need to talk about it any more . - How are you , Ingar ? Any better ? - No . I can 't stand this ... - I don 't understand . I can hardly breathe . - Have you been to the bathroom today yet ? It 's nothing like that . It feels really weird . Sit down here and have a rest . Tell me if you want to go back to camp , and I 'll help you . - Poor girl ... - It 's so fucking typical that I get sick now . - I can tell that you 're hurting . Tell me as soon as you want to go . - Yeah . Jacob ? Wasn 't it here where we found that thing ? Yeah , right , I recognize this place . - God , it 's still hot . - Really ? - Strange ... - Ow ! - What did you do ? - What happened ? What ? It was hot . - Shit , it 's 400 degrees Celcius . - Pssh ! That 's impossible . At 70 centimetres deep ... Wait , I have to ... What 's up ? - What does it show now ? - It shot up 100 degrees . - What the hell is this ! - Wow ... You found the mothership ! - What ' mothership ? ' - Our little alien must 've come from somewhere . - Maybe he crashed here ? - Cut it out . Well , it 's not a root fire . This is something else . Well , so what do we do ? I don 't know . Guys , I need to go back with Ingar . She 's not feeling well . - Oh ? - I don 't know what it is . I 'm going ahead . Come as soon as you can . This was weird . Fucking mobile phone . I got no signal . I have to go back to the main road . - How you feeling ? - If I rest a little , I 'll probably feel better . Hey , I 'm gonna cook some vegetables . They 're easy on the stomach . No , I don 't want any . I can barely even drink water . Poor thing ! OK , if you 're not better tomorrow , we need to get help . - You need anything else ? - No . - I 'm sorry , Tomas . - Sorry for what ? I feel so silly . You don 't have to sit here . You can go with the others . Of course I 'll sit here with you . I want to be with you . You know that . - How kind of you . - Ingar ... How is Ingar ? What the hell are you doing ? Can 't you see I 'm cooking here ? - It 's just a little dirt ... - Get your own tub ! Why so sour ? - Anyway , how is Ingar ? - We don 't know . Tomas is inside . You can ask him . Can I use this for a towel ? Did you find anything ? What ? Oh , they mention a fire here . In Spain three years ago . Well ? Apparently , they 've found extinct insects that have come back to life . " They believe the cells regained metabolism due to the high temperature . " Do you think it has something to do with that disgusting animal ? I don 't know . It 's not an ordinary burnt animal . " Up to 1000 degrees , " it reads ... Tomas - Tomas , how 's she doing ? - I don 't know , but she 's asleep , at least . I think I 'll stay with her , in case something happens tonight . - That 's good . Sleep well . - Same to you . - Jacob ! Come here ! - What 's up ? - How long has this been lying here ? - I don 't know . - When did you throw it here ? - Maybe 10-12 hours ago . Man , they 're really hot . But there 's no soil ... nothing . Maybe it 's ... Maybe it 's from that disgusting thing you like . The question is where that disgusting thing is ... Fuck , now I 'm sick of this fucking cooler ! There . Let 's go to bed . What 's up ? Ingar ! - Ingar ! - Tomas ! What the hell is happening ? She just ran right out . I don 't know what the hell it was . She screamed and then ran off . She was over here somewhere ... What happened ? I woke up , heard her howling and running out . I have no idea what the hell it was . - Did you see anything ? - Nothing ! She just screamed and ran out . - Ow ! - What is it ? - I hit a fucking tree . Can 't see shit out there ! - Jacob , did you see ... No , I didn 't see a damn thing ! It 's fucking pitch black out there ! Did you see anything ? Tomas , calm down . We have to find her , damn it ! But its pitch black ! - You think we 're just going to stand here ? - You 'll just kill yourself . Fuck ! It 's ice cold . Damn it . What 's happening ? - What 's wrong with her ? - I don 't know what happened . - We 'll find her tomorrow , I 'm sure . - This is fucking weird . What happened ? Did she say anything ? I was lying on the bed next to her , and then I woke up with her just standing there ... and she just started screaming ! Screaming like a maniac ! Didn 't you hear it ? - Of course we heard . - It was insane fucking screaming ! How can you just ask " what happened ? " We were thinking maybe something happened before ... DAY 3 Don 't spread too far apart . Let 's make sure we 're thorough here , so we don 't have to come back . Damn . That 's it for the water . Would you come with me to get more ? Our water 's done ! Marcus and I are going back for more ! - OK - Don 't go too far . Tomas ! - She 's ice cold . - Wait ... - Honey ... ! - Get out of here ! It 's me and Ann-Sofie ! - It 's me and Ann-Sofie ! - Go away ! Take it easy ! It 's Tomas and Ann-Sofie ! I 've got something inside me ! It 's ... it 's not me ... ! - You have to leave me here ! - Ingar , come on back with us . You should be in bed . You need to be in bed . You 're so cold . Come on ... - No ! You 've got to ... ! - Honey , look at me . Look at me . - We 'll have to carry her . - It 's something ... - I don 't want to die , Tomas ! - Poor thing , what are you saying ? Lift her ! - I don 't want to die ! - Why are you saying that ... ? If we leave her here , she will freeze to death ! - Ingar , come on . Try to walk . - No ! Ann-Sofie and I will carry you all the way . Come on . What the hell are we supposed to do ? Ingar ! Get a hold of yourself ! Come on ! Jesus ... ! Ingar , how are you ? Where did you find her ? We found her on the ground , after you went for water - Ingar , where the hell have you been ? - Take it easy ! Go inside ... There ... sit down . Oh God , you are ice cold . - Take off her T-shirt too . - There ... keep your arm down . We need a towel ... Hand me a towel . - I 'm going to heat some water . - Damn , Ingar , you scared the hell out of us . - Do you want anything , Ingar ? Whiskey ? - No . As soon as you 're warm , we 're going to the doctor , OK ? Jacob , where 's Marcus ? He went to town for help . He didn 't think we could find her alone . - What ? We don 't have the car ? - No , but he 'll be back ... and he 'll bring the police , or ambulance , or mountain rescue team or whatever they have out here . - I thought it was a good decision . - OK . - I 'm preparing the water . - From now on you don 't make an more decisions , hear me ? We need more blankets ! - How are you feeling ? - I 'm so scared . You don 't have to be scared . It feels like I have something in my throat . You 've only got a common infection or something ... Let me see . Open your mouth . I 'm going to have a look at your throat . Open up . I see ... and stick your tongue out ... yes , it 's turned a bit red ... - What 's the matter ? I told you it was something ! - Take it easy , Ingar ! Take it easy ! - What 's up ? - What the hell is going on ? - Here ... in her throat - What about her throat ? Something came up and went down again . What the hell are you talking about ? - Leave me alone , damn you ! - Ingar , what the hell are you doing ? Wait ! Stop ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Leave me alone ! - Look already ! - I 'm going to ! - Is this really necessary ? - Of course it is ! I 'm not making Tomas do this for fun ! - Please , I don 't want to do this . - Just a few seconds and it 'll all be over . - I 'll peek for a few seconds and it 'll be over . - Tomas , I don 't want to ... - Open your mouth a little . I just want to have a look . - Please , I don 't want to ! - Hell , I can 't do this ! - Open your mouth , Ingar . Open ! Damn it , look ! Fuck ! There 's nothing in there ! Something was there ! - Come on honey , let 's go inside . - So what do you think ? It was something . Tomas , the food will be ready soon . You coming out to eat ? - How is Ingar doing ? She wanna eat in the trailer ? - Yes she does . And me too . No , come eat outside instead . That 's so sad . We should eat together ! Tell that to your boyfriend instead . - Hi ! - Hi . You found her ? - Yes . - You did ! Great ! How 's she doing ? She 's OK , but she should see a doctor soon . How did it go for you ? To shit . Burnt trees fell across the road down there so I couldn 't get by . We 'll have to go back with a chainsaw and cut them . You were gone all day . What took you so long ? It was so nice out , I got some sun ... I tried to move the trees of course , but I couldn 't . Sorry for trying my best , in this fucking camp ! - Is Ingar in the trailer ? - Yes ... ... No ! Don 't go there ! - Why not ? - She 's got an infection or something ! What 's wrong with you ? What happened ? I looked into Ingars throat earlier today . Dammit , I saw something . Something black . I saw ... something move , and suddenly disappear . Both Ann-Sofie and Tomas think I 'm crazy , but I 'm telling you what I saw . - Something black in her throat ? - Fuck , I don 't know what it was ! I 've never seen that before ! There is something in Ingar 's throat ... ! Where the hell are you going , Tomas ? - I 'm taking Ingar to the doctor right now . - That won 't work . It 'll take you a full day to do that ! - I 'll use the chainsaw ... - Listen to what Marcus is saying ! I 'll cut up every fucking tree in the forest if I have to ! We ... That 'll be the first thing we do tomorrow morning . All of us . Hey guys , I think it 's time we ate . And we 'll drink the last of the wine with dinner tonight . Agreed ? We need to . OK , let 's see ... It was somewhere here , between the swamp and the stream here . Four big fucking pine trees lying across the road here . Is there any way around ? - Around ? - Yes , around ! Are there any ways around ? Around what ? There 's just burnt forest and marsh here ! Around what ? Around the whole fucking area ! Short cuts , paths , whatever ! I 've never been here before . How should I know ? Double-check the map . You sure you don 't want a glass of wine ? I think you could use one . There 's probably none left , the way you drink . There are still two full boxes , Mr. Drip . Don 't have any more . But ... this is such a grim atmosphere ! Now ... let 's try it this way , Jacob ... We ... You ... You didn 't find anything weird in Ingar 's throat ... and we never found that thing ... and no trees have fallen ... and tonight we 're going to have fun ... and tomorrow we go home ! That 's a good idea , right ? Huh ? I think we need to celebrate this with another glass of wine , Marcus ! Yup , I think Ann-Sofie 's proposal sounds very good ! - Ingar has to go to the bathroom , and I 'm helping her . - Have a nice time ! Are you sulking ? What ? No ... Then what is it ? I 'm just trying to ease things up a bit here . I think it 's become so boring here lately . I want peanuts ! Anybody ? - Where the heck are they ? - In the cupboard up there ... No , no ... The top drawer . What 's this ? Isn 't this somthing you took from that thing ? There 's a bug in it ! - What ? - You are kidding ! How the hell did it get there ? - Aw , Marcus , you put it there , right ? - Come on ! Why are you always accusing me ? Stop it . I certainly didn 't put it there . What the hell is he doing now ? - Fucking idiot ! - Tomas ! Tomas ! Well , what do we do now ? Fuck them . - What ? - Well , what you suppose we do ? Chase a car in the middle of the night ? Fuck ! DAY 4 Well , I bet he 's sitting in a sauna , drinking beer and laughing at us right now . Yeah , I guarantee he can 't get by those trees . Not a chance ! - Why hasn 't he come back then ? - Because he is the most stubborn man on earth . - It 's unbelievable that you two dated once . - What ? - I heard you guys . - No , we were at a party in the Biology Dept. in the beginning when we were 20 years old . - My god , it was a hundred years ago ! - Wait ! Wait ... - We were together a couple of weeks . It was nothing ! - I don 't get ... You were together with Tomas ? Of course she was ! This trip is based on the fact that everybody here is an old ex - of Ann-Sofie . I 've been with her , too ! Cut it out , Marcus ! Jacob , you must have dated other girls before we met . - No . Not idiots . - Tomas is not an idiot . - You 're just jealous of him . - Sure ... - It might be that he is the best in the university ... - Best ? Tomas is a fucking nobody . No imagination , no deductive ability . He 's like a computer . Information goes in through the ear and out the arse . - I think you 're jelous . - Of Tomas ? Are you joking ? Look ! There it is ... Tomas ! Hello ! ? Ingar ! Where are they ? The chain saw is here . See if it starts . There ! He 's sitting over there ! Back up ! - Sitting ? What do you mean ? - He was stitting ... sitting in the forrest . Tomas ! You OK ? - Tomas , where is Ingar ? - I don 't know where she is . What do you mean you don 't know ? What happened ? She 's gone . She ran away . I 've been looking for her all night ! Come on , sit down in the car . What do we do now ? Go back to the camp ? Hell no ! We cut that fucking tree so we can go back to town ... and they can send police and helicopters or whatever . Let them find Ingar ! I don 't want to be in this God damned forest anymore ! I want to be in civilization ! I want to eat at McDonald 's ! Oh , this is just too much ! This is too stupid ! What the fuck are you laughing at ? Hell , we 're trying to help you ! - Stop laughing ! This isn 't funny ! - This is just so fucking hilarious ! - There is nothing funny about this . - This is so fucking stupid ! - Dammit , I don 't know anything about cars . - But I do . Move it ! Maybe we should call somebody ? You are an idiot , Tomas . You know that ? Oh my God ... If you were sick , wouldn 't you want me to take you to a hospital as fast as possible ? You haven 't changed a bit . You are as big a moron as ever . Ann-Sofie , can you come here for a minute ? What are you doing ? You locked the door ? You remember the bug we found in the glass tube ? I put it in the box with the other insects ... It killed all of them ! Hello ! You locked the door ? Yes , we did . - May I ask why ? - Because we are paranoid . - We can 't lock him up , Jacob ! - Why not ? - What do you mean ? - You know what I think ? I think this is starting to get really scary . I know I saw something in Ingar 's throat , and Tomas is acting so strange . I ... What ? What are you trying to say ? That I 'm really tired of this . Can we go home , Ann-Sofie ? Can 't we just go home , you and me ? Honey , Marcus will get back soon and he 'll have gotten cell phone signal , and people will come and help us . OK ? I 'm unlocking the door for Tomas . We can 't act like this ! We 're friends ! Don 't unlock it . Don 't unlock it ! We can 't keep him locked up just because you can 't get along with him ! Thanks . What is he doing ? Everything is so confusing right now ... What ? I think he 's a little jealous , too ... He found out we 'd been together . Oh boy ... That probably wasn 't for the best ! Tomas , can you just sit in here for today ? Please ? He 's so paranoid ! Can 't you just stay here ? - Do you think there 's something wrong with me ? - No , I don 't , but ... - I think you need some sleep . - No , but I don 't ! I 'm fresh . I feel happy ! Happy ? After everything that 's happened , you feel ' happy ? ' Not ' happy ... ' I didn 't mean it like that ... I don 't recognize you . What 's the matter with you ? Oh ... On second thought , I must be tired ... You must be tired , too ... ? Well , yeah ... I haven 't slept much the last two nights . Right ... Then you get like this ... Everything gets all fragmented ... This feels just like our InterRail trip . Remember ? Filthy ... lousy food ... crowded and no sleep . - Eh , it wasn 't that bad , was it ? - Yes it was . Don 't you remember ? You remember France ? Oh , right ... Yeah , it was a bit tiring , I guess ... A bit ? We were thrown off the train ! Don 't you remember that ? Oh yeah , damn ! Yes , we were ! I forgot about that . Where was that ? It was ... in Brest , right ? Or was it in Nantes ? - I think it was in Bretagne , maybe ... - Brest , I think it was ... - You think so ? - Yes , I remember the platform there ... Or Nantes ! No , it was Nantes ! - I don 't remember . - What are you doing ? Locking the door ? We have never been to France ! For God 's sake , we 've never been on an InterRail trip ! Who are you ? Who are you , really ? Hey guys ! Open up ! I need to go pee ... You can piss in a bottle ! - What ? - You can piss in a bottle ! - I want to pee outside ! - Shut up , Tomas . Ann-Sofie , please open up ... I misunderstood ! I was mixing up trips ! I 've been InterRailing with some buddies , too . Do I need to be locked up for that ? It seems a little like overreacting to me . What ? You locked him up because he remembered wrong ... ? Thank you ! Finally , a normal human being ! You keep your mouth shut , Tomas ! Get away from that fucking window and shut the fuck up ! Jacob , your eyes are red . You need to get some sleep . Please , Tomas , can 't you just stay in there for the night ? Go to bed ! You have everything you need in there . I 'm too tired to argue about this any more . I 'm not the one causing trouble , Jacob I can stay in here , but I just don 't want to be regarded as a lunatic who needs to be locked up ! Understand that , at least ... OK , tomorrow morning at dawn , we leave . Hold on until then , OK ? Can I join you tommorow then , or do I stay here ? What 's your plan ? Of course you 'll join us ! My God ... . Somebody has to empty this one . It 's full . Jacob ? What 's going on ? In the forest ... it 's a fucking mess ... ! It 's dead animals fucking mixed together ! Birds ... worms ! They 're eating each other ! But those are not animals ! What is it then ? Are they skinned or something ? Oh my God ... That is the most disgusting thing I 've seen in my life . OK ... I think we better get out of here . - Now . The three of us . - What ? Without Tomas ? - Yes . Without Tomas . - But why ? - He has nothing to do with this . Come on ! - I 'm not even going to reply to that . I just want to get out of here . - Come on , Ann-Sofie . - No , I 'm not so sure , Jacob ... We can 't leave Tomas here . Ingar is probably dead by now ! Now we 're going to leave someone else in this forrest ? Maybe she 's not dead ! Let 's do this : tomorrow morning when we wake up , all four of us leave this Goddamned forest . And no more fucking suggestions ! Now let 's go home . Thank you . OK ... Shortest stick takes first watch . Please ... Can 't you just do what I 'm saying ? - OK , it 's me . - No , I can take the first watch ... - No , it 's OK . Who takes over after me ? - I can . How long are the shifts ? Well , three hour shifts ? Is that acceptable ? - OK , see you tomorrow morning then ... - Marcus , wait a minute ... Don 't get angry now , but I want you to sleep here tonight . I don 't want anyone to sleep alone tonight . Dammit , cut it out . What the hell are you up to ? OK , then , can I get my sleeping bag , Mr. Jacob ? Jesus Christ ... - God ! - Oops ! Sorry . - You scared me ! - I didn 't mean to . - What are you doing up this late ? - I couldn 't sleep . Yeah , me neither . This is insane ! I can 't sit here anymore . I want to go home ! Sure , we all want that , Tomas . Will we be enemies when we get home ? I sure don 't hope so . Maybe we could have dinner sometime ? Just you and me . Stop talking like that ! What are you up to ? I don 't get you ! What do you mean " like that ? " Hell , I 'm just talking about dinner ! You 're the sick ones ! You locked me up ! I haven 't done anything ! I 'm fucking tired of sitting in this fucking trailer ! - Open the door ! - Please , stop ! You ! Release me ! Marcus . Marcus ! Marcus , it 's your turn now . Oh , please , let 's just forget it . - No . Stand up . - Oh my God , how tedious ... - What time is it ? - 1 AM Tomas has been asleep for about an hour . Wake Jacob at 4 AM . He 'll take the last shift . Tomas , cut it out ... . Jacob and Ann-Sofie will just get mad at me . Stop it , dammit ! Tomas , fuck off ! This isn 't fun any more ! What the fuck ... Ingar ! Why hello Marcus . Where have you been ? Just out in the forest . But ... we 've been looking for you . Push him down . Push him down , the broken cunt . DAY 5 What the ... Ann-Sofie ! Wake up ! What is it ? What time is it ? 9 AM . Marcus never woke me up . He must have overslept , fucking whore ! Morning . What are you doing ? I 'm having breakfast . King Coco . Want some ? Where 's Tomas ? He is asleep , I suppose . Why didn 't you wake me up ? Did you forget , or fall asleep ? I wasn 't tired so I thought I could go on . It didn 't matter , did it ? Hey guys , I need to go to the bathroom ! I can take him . I 'm going to give him breakfast , anyway . What ? You 're going to open the door ? Of course . How else could he go number two ? I 'm not sure I think that 's OK . Where is he supposed to shit then ? In a jar ? Take it easy . I 've got this . What 's so funny ? My stomach aches . Honey ... I 'd rather be at home with you now ... in your apartment , freshly bathed and naked in your bed . This isn 't that romantic ... Not really . - Jacob - Yes ? I 'm looking forward to celebrating Christmas with your parents . All your other relatives can come too . Where the hell did they go ? Let them be ... Stop fooling around ... Marcus ! If this is a joke I 'm going to kill you ! Do you hear me ? Come here ! Hurry ! - I found Ingar . - What ? Well , Jacob , are you going to lock up both of us now ? You are so sweet . I 've just caused trouble for you since we got here . It 's not your fault . Number one concern is that you get well . - Do we have to go ? Can 't we just stay here ? - What do you mean ? Well , I feel good . It would be so satisfying if we could finish the job . You have such beautiful hands , Ann-Sofie ! Am I right , Marcus ? They are exquisite . Do you want a smoke ? No thank you . Hi Jacob . What 's up ? I 'm packing . I was talking to Ingar , and she 's not doing too bad , so we 're really not in any hurry to leave . We could work for a few more days , anyway . Jacob , let 's let bygones be bygones . I forgive you ! I want to look at your throat . What ? I want to check your throat first . Oh God , you just spoiled it again ! I just want us to get along , don 't you see ? I want you to stay in the trailer . I may be insane and all , but I 'd feel better if you did . I want you to be in the trailer ! Well , I want you in the trailer . Ann-Sofie ! Lock yourself in the trailer and see how it feels , cocksucker ! - What is it ? - Why the hell didn 't you answer ? - I didn 't hear you . - Come on . We 're going . - What 's going on ? - Come on ! Grab only the essentials . Get the maps . I 've got the rest . What happened ? Pack ! Now ! Are you ready ? Come have a look . Here 's another one . Come and look ! Here 's another one . This one might be even bigger . I can see your face in it , Jacob . What 's up ? Ah , you need to check me . You want to have a look ? We want you to have a look . Run ! Run ... ! Oh my God ! Please , let 's stay here . No , we have to keep going . 5 more minutes . Hey , you ! Come on out now ! God , I 'm freezing . They 'll see us if we make a fire . We 're probably close to a cell tower , so ... if we walk a few miles tomorrow , I 'm sure we 'll make contact . We 'll make it , right ? Mmhm ... - Hey , Ann-Sofie ... - Mmm ? I know this might not be the best timing , but ... What ? I can 't be with you anymore . What ? I can 't walk in this forest pretending that that I still ... What ? That you ... that you still love me ? You told me you had 't been with Tomas . Fuck ! Why didn 't you tell me ? My God , Jacob , how can you talk about that now ? Is that why you 're breaking it off ? The one I 'm together with , I should be able to trust 100 % , and she has to trust me . I can 't take these sorts of silent secrets . But I love you ! - I must be honest . That 's the way I am . - But I love you Jacob ! - It 's too late , Ann-Sofie . - No ! You can 't do this . Jacob , you can 't do this to me now ! Stop it ! - Go to sleep . - I can 't sleep . I 'll turn off the light now , to save the battery . - Ann-Sofie , stop . Don 't do this . - I 'm not doing anything . - Don 't do this ! - But I 'm not doing anything ! What ? What is it ? - Come on . You didn 't touch me ? - No ... We 'll have to try to sleep one at a time . I don 't want to sleep in the dark . OK , then we can have the flashlight on . DAY 6 Ann-Sofie ? I 'm peeing ! Jacob ! Are you there ? Show yourself ! If you don 't , I 'll leave ! What was it ? It was nothing . Probably just an animal . You can 't walk away from me like that ! Never leave me like that ! What we talked about yesterday ... . Did you mean what you said ? I don 't know ... I don 't know . I was just tired . I love you , Jacob . I love you so much . What have you done ? What ? What have you got in your mouth ? It tastes rotten . I think it tastes sweet . - No , no .. ! - Ann-Sofie ... We 'll be arriving in Uppsala soon . Next stop , Uppsala ... . THE UNKNOWN English subtitles : Empty Cinema Nanook 2009

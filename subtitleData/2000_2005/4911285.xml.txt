Banning 's got the bacteria but he has to transport it from his lab to the water . There 's no way he can . Maybe with airplanes . Not possible . even if he could get it to a reservoir undetected an alarm would trigger the second the surface of the water 's broken . You 're really smart . It 's an act . I 'm an inexperienced girl who 's trying to bluff her way through . You are ? stop humoring me . Just be honest . ... assuming that there are some out there ... Honest ? All right . You think I 'm the great Clark Devlin . ( phone ringing ) ... gonna say I look lovely ... hello ? I can 't talk right now . ...

It will work because my plan is perfect . it 's your plan ... and mine . Um ... it 's ours . Shut up . Explain . all righty . The life cycle of the Gerris maginatus begins with mating ... something Dr. Simms is not personally familiar with . the insects swarm to freshwater where fertilized eggs are then deposited on the underside of lotus leaves and hatch into larvae . Spare me the Discovery Channel blather . ( chuckles ) Tell me why it won 't work . tell us . Why it won 't work ? correct ? You incubated insects native to the southern hemisphere . it is too cold for them to mature sexually ... much like Simms here . Therefore ... they won 't mate . they won 't seek out water . Is this true ? quite well . Very well . And then you remember cousin Doris ? the bugs . The bugs . you 're not going to believe this hootchie Mr. Banning ? yeah ? Ask him if I lied about the tuxedo . This tuxedo is ... it 's all right . It 's ... All right " ? That is the most incredible piece of technology on the planet . hot hands . release the bugs . Go ahead . Do what he tells you .

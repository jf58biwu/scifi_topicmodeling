 Grandpa 's boat is not here . - He knows we 're coming . - Come on , maybe we can see him . You are so slow . What a sluggish brother I have . You should be able to ride faster . Can 't you ride faster ? Come on ! Just wait until we get to the top . - There he is , he 's on his way . - What did you expect ? Last one down to the harbor is a loser . You shouldn 't bother , you little shit . You don 't have a chance . No , not you . You 'll not sneak into my house . Be quiet now . Otherwise I 'll cut you down . I have scissors , understand ? School holidays ... - Hello , Mrs. Randskov . - Good day , Christian . Be quiet now . You 're ridiculous . Loser ! It was down to the harbor , not in the water , idiot . You 're insane . Hello , boys . Having a swim ? - Oh , damn ! - You shouldn 't mess around like that . - You should have respect for the water . - I do . No , you don 't . What kind of boat is that ? That 's Maja ? She 's grown up ! - What do you mean ? - Since last summer . - She 's grown tits . - It was just a matter of time . Should I show you how to do it ? - Wait until you get hair on it , you . - Just get going . - Hey , Christian . Nice getup . - It 's new . The latest fashion in Copenhagen . - Has it been in the water cycle as well ? - No , Ask couldn 't control himself . - What kind of boat is it ? - A minesweeper that Dad bought . It makes 15 knots . - Who are those people ? - Wreck divers . They 've rented it . It 's Christian ! So is it holiday time , or what ? - Congratulations on the boat . - What do you think ? - It 's big . - Do you want a tour ? It was a steal . He has to see the inside . Come on , boy . All this is from a fishing boat in Frederikshavn . Radar , scanner and GPS navigator . What do you say to that ? Best of all is the Alfa Motor . It 's indestructible . - How fast do you think it can go ? - I don 't know , 15 knots ? Yes . Fast as the devil . Dad ! He 's been like that ever since we got the boat . - Are you here by yourselves ? - Yes , well ... Mom might come later if she gets free . We 're going diving in the morning . - You want to come ? - Of course . I just have to ask first . You coming ? Coffee . Cappuccino for customers . This would be the dishwasher if the bank would give the loan . - One thing at a time , you know ? - Yes , of course . - Here 's the refrigerator , freezer ... - I thought you only drank lots of beer . They have everything - lots of money . Come and see the diving bunker . I 'm just showing Christian around , I hope we 're not interfering ... - Not at all , I just came in . - It is excellent equipment , you can see . Hi , Christian . I 'm Eric . This is Simon . And that 's Niels from the North Sea . What are you diving for ? - Do you dive , Christian ? - Yes , a little . But not like this . - How old are you ? - 17 . A good age . That 's when I started . One has the courage and mobility . Everything is possible and should be tested , right ? 17 years ... One day you 'll have an ass as big as Simon 's and then it 's no fun anymore . I had that before I was 17 . Why didn 't you contract out , Grandpa ? You could have earned a fortune . - I want nothing to do with that rabble . - They seemed decent . Eric has searched wrecks for many years . - He has no respect for anything . - You could have used the money . One always needs money . A bottom coat of paint wouldn 't hurt . - It 'll be good weather tomorrow . - I 'm too old for that . - Almost completely calm . - It 's enough to keep an eye on you two . Tomorrow I 'll go out and find German gold for you , Grandpa . What do you say ? - We were cool . Look at my hair . - Cool souvenirs , too . - Postcards from the National Museum ! - Christian , we must size you up this year . You 've grown a bit , but I think they should fit . - But the old suit is too small . - There 's no room for his ass . - Here . Ask can have your old one . - But this is yours . It 's too big , really . So ... There 's room for a little enthusiasm . - What about you ? - I 'm not going down with you . - I can 't . Not with my lungs . - Because you always suck on those . Well , be that as it may , that 's how it is . Yes ... What is it with you ? You 've often dived without me . Yes ... Oh , please ... Hi ! The war 's final days left a lot of dead men around the island of Sejerø . The Germans held the lighthouse and the whole area was blockaded before anyone knew what had happened . They say that there was a submarine . - Did no one look for it ? - You can imagine that they did . Many looked for it in the years that followed . Myself , as well . Looking for your grandpa ? In any case , you know that we should let the dead rest in peace . Here comes the protuberance on the bottom . - Yes , and then it passed . - Do you smoke all the time ? Now we leave the area . And ... clean bottom . Switching to area 7B . New course . Shift region . - Shouldn 't we search the whole Kattegatt ? - Yes , we 'll continue on . - We won 't be finished before it 's dark . - I rented a ship to get something done . It applies to you and your friend , too . I hired you . Area 7B , please . Keep close together . You have about 30 minutes . There 's somebody diving out there . - It must be Jørgen . - The old man ? I think you said they 'd be diving . I don 't want anybody in my area . Mark their position . Didn 't Ask come up ? We couldn 't see him . What the hell is he doing over there ? We 're going home now . Raise anchor . - Give a sign if you swim away . - Like you 'd notice . - You 're too busy with her . - You 're ruining everything , damn it . Grow up . - Christian ... I heard something . - What ? I don 't know what it was , but I heard something . What 's with the echo sounder ? - What 's happening ? - I have no idea . It 's going crazy . It 's probably just static . There 's something there . - What the hell was that ? - Go and see . We ran into a buoy . One would think it was the Flying Dutchman . - Don 't touch anything , damn it . - No one touched anything . Christian , look who 's coming . - Hey , Mom ! - How nice that you came , Birthe . - But I can 't stay . - But it 's the holidays . I have to be back at the hospital tomorrow . I 'm working overtime . - So you don 't have to . - Fair enough . Can you hear under water ? Voices , for example . Can you ? - What ? - It was creepy . Creepy ? Why would you want to dive if it 's unpleasant ? I keep an eye on him the whole time . - You weren 't down with them ? - I cannot dive anymore . - Ask is not even 15 . - You should have given birth to me earlier . Ask and Christian watch out for each other . They know it 's serious down there . Nothing will happen , Mom . - Shouldn 't you insulate the boat ? - Birthe , one does not insulate a boat . It was only my sailor . - We often dive without Grandpa . - You do ? Yes , honest . I promise ... no , I swear by God , that I 'll look after my little brother . Is that ok ? Yes , I suppose it is . - There 's Bones . - Mrs. Randskov ? She 's strange . - Why is she waving like that ? - Grandpa ! Bones is on the pier . Why is she waving backwards ? She 's insane . Watch your tongue . She lost her entire family to the sea . - They say she talks with the dead . - That can 't be . Why 's she called Bones then ? You 're just like her , but she has more beard . - Hey , hey ... - Are you still a couple ? A couple ? We see each other sometimes . It 's only human . She 's called Mrs. Randskov . And she cannot talk to the dead . And by the way , there 's very few who understand what she says . Don 't worry . I 'll take care of them . - What are they doing ? This is our place . - Calling from Anne Marie Sejerø : - We have divers out , so keep your distance . - Maja told them our position . - She wouldn 't do that . - We found it first . Dickhead ! Relax . It 's their place . Go down and wash your mouth ... dickhead . They would salvage something there was no money in ? - It might be the same one . - That was no ordinary buoy . The Germans put out many such distress beacons . Take it easy now , boys . There it goes again . - I 'll be damned . - There 's something there . What the hell was that ? Throw the anchor , so we don 't drift away . - I 've never seen anything like it . - Careful . - It 's incredible ! - It 's like new . Look at it ! The break is fresh . The submarine must be in the vicinity . It is . I 'll be damned . - Well ? - It 's U-461 's distress buoy . The serial number corresponds with the Russian records . It 's true . It 's true ... If it 's from U-461 it would have disappeared a week ago . This is it . I 'm hot on its trail . Will we go down ? You 'll get your chance , Niels . You will have the dive of your life . CWA . Good morning , can I help you ? - 5326 , please . - Just a moment . This is Captain Eric Simms . I have a message for Mr. Owen . Message reads : " Stürmvogel is in sight . " - This is awesome . - I really don 't like this . But we have to check it out , Grandpa . We have to see what it is . Calm down , Grandpa . It 's probably nothing . It 's ok . I 'm fine . Are you insane ? Put it in your mouth . - Christian , I heard something . - Doesn 't matter . We 're going up , Ask . - We 'll never get out of here . - I 'm scared , Christian . We 'll open this . Use your mouthpiece . It may be flooded inside . What the hell ? This is wild . We have to get the hell out of here . Damn it , Ask ! - Are you okay ? - Yes . There 's a door down there . Damn ! Come on , Ask . Back this way . Christian , there 's something here . Christian , it 's coming after you ! - Christian , there 's something here . - Ok , calm down . - Christian ... - Calm down . - I want out ! - Calm down , ok ? Calm down . He 's dead , ok ? Dead . What the hell ? The entire crew must have died in their bunks . Christian ... - No , stop . Don 't do that . Stop ! - Calm down , okay ? Calm down . What were you doing ? Why were you down so long ? - There 's German gold . - Catch your breath first . You can 't stay down for so long . It was just a short dive . - But there was air . Air down there . - Air ? What are you talking about ? Look . - Where did it come from ? - A U-Boat lying down there . - There was air inside it . - You went in ? I don 't fucking believe this . What were you thinking , boy ? There could be mines down there . Are you crazy ? We were agreed that it 's a memorial . Use your brain a little . - Raise anchor . - Why ? They can see us on the radar . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . No , damn it . Those grave robbers shouldn 't be rummaging around there . - We must find out what kind of boat it is . - We have the German gold . Now we have to shut up . Of course . But I don 't understand how there could be air down there . - I thought you would be at home . - I thought so , too . - Has something happened ? - As you can tell . Hello , boys . Have you experienced anything unusual today ? I sensed that something happened . What about you , Ask ? What have you seen ? Christian , show her the watch . Where did it come from ? There 's a wreck down there . It 's the old German submarine . - Have you taken it from someone ? - No , we found it . Enough with the hocus-pocus , Inger . You 'll scare the boys . - You must get rid of it immediately . - Be careful ! It 's old . One should not interfere with such forces . Do you understand ? What the hell ? It 's ticking . It works . - Yes , it works . - I 'll be damned . A low frequency transmitter from 1945 . That 's insane . - It can still receive signals . - In theory , yes . So if the submarine is still sending out signals , we can track it . It 's not likely ... after 50 years . Yes , yes , Niels , it was just a thought . Continue , André . It 's ok . They work for us . - What are we looking for ? - U-461 . - U-461 . What are we really after ? - We 're looking for gold , of course . Gold was not sent by regular submarines . This is something else , isn 't it ? No . If we did not think that there was gold down there the company would not have invested as much as they have . André , do you understand what I 'm asking ? What is U-461 ? I want you to know that our organization is very happy . Very happy ... with the work you 've been doing for us . - Ok , let 's go for the gold . - Yes ... He has come from ... Holland , or Switzerland or somewhere . You should see him , he looks like a hired killer . They paid father for two extra weeks , so he indulges them . What ? Why are you looking at me like that ? I am ? How ? - I 've been waiting for you . The coffee is ready . - Were you expecting me ? Have some cookies , then I 'll see what I can do . The picture 's better now , right ? It 's all in the hands . Here we dunk . - You want to tell me what happened ? - Sure . Oh , that Meyerheim ... He always has a new tie on . They must have a lot of ties at the TV station . - I keep my eye on him . - Sure . What was it you wanted to tell me ? Why do you have a watch that doesn 't work ? I was there , floating in the dark . I heard them faintly at first . But then it got clearer . It sounded just like voices . - It was strange ... - Wait , that 's very interesting . Isn 't it ? - There was a child 's voice . - What are you saying ? It sounded like children 's voices . It sounded as if they were crying or ... - It 's just the spirits . They want to hear , too . - What ? I have heard drowned sailors who called out , but the voices of children ... - Called out ? - When you die the Lord takes you . Sometimes the souls believe they can return to their bodies and live on . So they remain in their bodies if something disturbs them at the moment of death . - And if they don 't die ? - It 's the same with your body as with milk . It has an expiration date . It can go a little over , but not for long . Then it will be something else . Sour milk . If you find old milk which has become sour and see that it 's whole milk on the carton , you will be confused . So you throw it out . Then you have neither ... and you 're doomed . Excluded from the universe . It is the same with souls . They are confused . They do not know if they are alive or dead . But you say the children cry ? - A living death ? - Now I must speak with the spirits . - Can I borrow you , Ask ? - I have to ... Don 't be afraid , nothing will happen . This is kind of you . We need to figure this out . I want to speak with the lost , the insecure , through this boy 's power . Speak to us . With the German gold , I 'll take you to the Roskilde Festival every year . Or I 'll buy you the entire festival . I hear something . We have contact , Ask . - Christian , it 's ticking . - What ? Who are you ? Where ? I can 't hear what you say . Speak to us . Who are you ? Give us a sign . Mrs. Randskov ? Mrs. Randskov ? - Strange . There must be something wrong . - Yeah , I think so . We should not seek more contact . It is a dangerous energy . - I do not think it was human . - I have to go home now . Keep far away from the submarine . - Under all circumstances . Understand ? - As with sour milk ? Sour milk ? Yes . - Could this be it ? - No . There were no guns on deck . But it had a tower . And wings . Ask , come and look on the web . No German submarines had wings then . The first was not until the ' 60s . But it had them . Didn 't it , Ask ? U-461 . U-461 ... That number doesn 't exist . We must be on to something special . At the end of the war many submarines were loaded with valuables that were transported out of Germany . It is . It surely is . " Stürmvogel . " There it is ! - " Stürmvogel . " Storm Bird . - Did you hear that , Ask ? Cool , huh ? " U-461 was especially constructed ... Stürmvogel was ... " ... said to carry a never tested energy supply . " The principle was self-charging batteries utilizing the electronic differences ... - " ... between the wake 's " ? - Yes . " The electronic difference between the wake 's intake and outtake valves . " It sounds like ... a perpetual motion machine . " The submarine was top secret . Most of the information - " - was either destroyed or has disappeared . " - The Nazis were evil people . - Yes , but also very rich . - Are you sure that is it ? - Ask , come and see . You can go inside it . That was where we were . That is exactly where we were . We got no further than there . That door was locked . See there ? That 's where the gold is . It 's right there . - What are you doing here , Maja ? - I thought you were Eric . - He won 't want you here . - I 'm leaving . We 'll go out again tomorrow ? Ask ? I don 't know . Maybe we should listen to Mrs. Randskov . It 's what we 've always dreamed about . She shouldn 't be allowed to ruin it . We have to see what 's in the cargo hold . Mrs. Randskov is sensible , but sometimes you have to read between the lines . - Say we 'll go out . - We should report it ... They 'll only block the area , and we won 't be able to dive there again . There could be corpses there . You saw no traces of the crew ? - No . - We have to find out what happened . Grandpa ... We saw the crew . They were dead . You idiot , Ask ! - A skeleton , yes . It was 60 years ago . - We 're not going out there again . You should get credit for finding the wreck . We 'll report it to the authorities , so it will be made a memorial . Yes , that 's the right thing . - What if the grave is disturbed ? - End of the conversation , Christian . No more nonsense . Period . That 's it . What the hell is this ? No , it 's not gold we 're looking for . But we 're willing to pay you $ 50,000 to salvage it . And to keep quiet . - I want to know what we 're after . - Some containers , such as that . Perhaps copper . There may be several down there , but I 'll settle for one . That is " Operation Karan . " It aimed to bring invaluable experiments and research results out of the country before it collapsed . What kind of experiments ? Doctors had succeeded in producing a code that halted the aging process . Down there is the source of everlasting life . - That 's insane . - Is it ? What is down there is the future of humanity . - And what is in the containers ? - Some selected young test subjects . Who the hell are you ? Are you Nazis ? Who we are and what we want isn 't your concern . The compensation should convince you of that . It 's not about the pay . Why don 't they go up to hers ? It 's probably to keep an eye on us . - Are you always so exciting ? - Now , what do you think ? - Christian ? - What ? What do you think is in the cargo hold ? Do you really think it 's gold ? They certainly didn 't constructed a special type of submarine to carry fruit . It would be cool to give Grandpa a real birthday gift . Something for the boat ... New planks and bottom paint . We can take a rubber boat . And sneak out after they 're asleep . 20 hours disconnected from the boat 's life support system . Can we manage to bring them home ? Can you give us time enough ? - I can take no risk to lose them . - This is in your life support . It will give us the 20 hours we need to get them to the lab and I believe that 's enough . So how do you feel ? Do you have the strength to pull it through ? I 'll go up and take a look at the stars . I never felt better . Get some sleep , André . - Hold up . - No , we have to go now . Are you okay ? If not , we 'll go back . Give me your hand . What are you doing ? What the hell ? This is crazy . Shit ! Go and find Eric . - What the hell was that ? - I don 't know . Be careful . Come on . Here goes . Use your mouthpiece . What the hell is this ? There 's something here . - What is all this ? - It 's not dangerous . That 's what I heard . It 's not dangerous . Help ... - Christian ! - Ask ! Ask , I 'm coming . I 'm coming , Ask . Ask , hold on . I 'm coming . Hold on . - Ask ... - What 's wrong ? - Ask . Where is Ask ? - No idea . They 've gone out to the sub . Mayday , Mayday . Ask ! Ask ! Ask , wake up . Come on , Ask . Come on ! Prepare the pressure chamber . We have a diving accident . - He 's very unstable . - There are no signs of narcosis . Ask ! How bad is it ? What 's happened , Christian ? - Forgive me , Mom . - He 's had a knock on the head . I managed to grab 10.5 seconds before it stopped . It seems crazy but when you decipher the message using the German Enigma code you get : " Longitude setting 11 degrees east , " 18 hours after aircraft attack . " But how can it be sending something ? - Can we take its bearing ? - I plotted the location . We were here when we received the signal . If the signal came from 6.4 nautical miles away we received the signal from a point in this circle . If we take into account the longitude the sender is either here ... or here . Christian ... We only went down to look . Sorry . - We shouldn 't have gone . Sorry . - Easy ... - Christian ... - He said there was something there . - I think he saw something , I ... - What do you think ? I can 't explain it . It was so strange . - Christian ... - It 's my fault if he dies . He 'll be ok . Don 't be afraid . Relax . - We 'll go to the northern position . - Where to , exactly ? The second position is closer to where we collected the buoy . I think more to the north . Just ask me , I know where the others have dived . Why do you say that ? Christian found this in the submarine . So they found it . They 've been down there . - Why didn 't you tell me before ? - It 's there . - Christian said so . Dad , I ... - Good girl . Get going , boys . But I think we shall take the second position . If you don 't object , Maja . Christian ... - I can feel him . - What did you say ? Ask . I can feel him . He called to Christian . - Inger , for God 's sake ! - He 's out there , Jørgen . - Out there ? - Yes . In the submarine . Together with someone ... I can 't see who . You go down first with the camera . Then you rest for an hour while André and I go down . We should be able to recover everything in three hours . Ok ? I don 't like this . I think we should keep far away . Get hold of yourself . We 're divers . Come on . - Do you really believe in this ? - I can 't explain it . But she says that there is something that keeps him in the wreck . - She may be a little hocus-pocus ... - What if it 's true ? - What if he called to me ? - Give it up , Christian . You felt that something was wrong before we arrived . I don 't want to talk about it . All he needs to know is that I 'm here with him . - But what if he 's not here ? - What ? Birthe , the more time that passes , the less chance there is of finding him . Find him ? You have to stop this . My boy is here . Have you gone mad ? I think we can get Ask back if he can see Christian . He is scared and vulnerable . It is important that no one disturbs him , or he will disappear forever . We must go out there . We 're going nowhere . My boy is here and fighting , and you 're talking nonsense . We 're going out there . I stand to lose him . I don 't understand . It 's as if he wants to return . But he can 't . Ask , can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Christian ... - Have you filled the yellow bottles ? - Yes . Why didn 't you tell me about Christian ? And why did you tell them ? Notify us about current conditions so that we can ready the cable . We are approaching . I think we found it . What 's happening ? Simon ? - Just a moment . - Simon , do you read me ? Goddamn it . Shit . - What 's going on ? - What the hell ? Eric , it 's an old container . - What the hell are you playing at ? - I knew you wouldn 't believe me . What the hell ? Enough is enough . Let go ! Release me ! Dad ! You must enter the room where he drowned . You must bring anything that is his . Something personal . Got it ? His amulet . Will this do ? Put it where he drowned , and show him that you are there . Here , Christian . This should hold tight until you get down . Do you remember everything ? - Can you hear me ? - Sure , just fine . Are you okay ? I 'm ok . I 'm in now . Ok , I 've put it here . What do I do now ? Tell him to wait . It 's becoming clearer for me . There are other souls trapped down there , held back from eternity . Christian , it 's ... Just a moment . Hold on . - You say it for me . - Ask ? Who 's holding you back ? - Ask , who are they ? - Mrs. Randskov ? Are you talking to me ? Inger , damn it . Allow me . Christian ? One moment . - No , damn it . - Ask , can you hear me ? - Tell me who 's holding you back . - We have a diver in the water . I repeat , we have divers in the water . We have divers in the water ! Anne Marie to Blue Diver . What the hell are they doing ? Keep in radio contact . You hear ? Keep in radio contact . - We heard you . - I don 't trust them . Fucking idiots . - Hold on . - We have to get out . Christian , divers are on the way down . Christian ? Do you hear me ? - Ask ? - Christian ? Be careful . There are torpedoes here . Let it go . Ask ? Ask ? Ask , is that you ? - Ask ? - Christian . Ask ? - Ask ! Ask ! - Christian , can you hear me ? I think I saw him . It was unbelievable . But he disappeared again . Christian , come up now . Come up ! Christian , come up now ! There 's a boy here . There are several boys here . Small children in containers . They live in like ... a respirator . The children . It 's them . They are the ones holding Ask . You need to get them out . Christian , you must get them out . - The batteries ... - I have contact . Christian , break the containers . As long as their bodies are intact they do not understand that they 're dead . Get them out of the containers . Hurry . - Let 's proceed . - André , I 'm right behind you . Stop him . He 's destroying the bodies . - Go to hell , Eric ! - Christian ! I 'll take care of him . Proceed . Carry on . - Christian ? Christian ? - He can 't hear you . I have to try . What happening ? Christian ? He missed one . There is still a soul that 's holding Ask . - Eric , what about the boy ? - Forget him . Hurry up . - Jørgen , you can 't go down . - I have to try . It 's my boys . Jørgen , you cannot go down . We 're ready here . Pull us up . Understood ? Ask ! Ask ! - What 's going on ? - Eric , the cable is stuck in the winch . Pull us up , damn it . Pull us up , damn it ! - Eric , we can 't . - Now ! We 're out of time . Pull us up ! Shit ... Eric , it 's going down . The torpedos ! Switch up ! Christian ... Christian ? Christian ! Maja , Christian is still down there . Can you see him ? Christian ! There he is . There he is ! Christian . I saw you . - Where were you ? - I don 't know . It was like a dream . You came down and got me ? Crazy . - You were close to dying , Ask . - Was I ? Crazy . It 's nothing to grin about . It was you , Ask . For better or worse . Go ahead ... Do you like them ? - Blow them out , Dad . - I can 't blow them all out . This is just wrong . One gets less and less air and more and more candles ... Translation and subtitles : sled1025

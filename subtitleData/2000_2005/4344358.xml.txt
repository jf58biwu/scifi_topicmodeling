 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . - Stop . - Come back . Darling , darling . - Hi . Enrique Pena . - Yeah , I know . I saw you pitch a no-hitter against the Padres . - Pretty awesome . - Thanks . But I 'd trade 10 no-hitters for one ride aboard the space shuttle . - So I guess I don 't have to introduce myself . - It 's kind of weird , isn 't it ? People knowing who you are without you telling them . It 's kind of fun and scary at the same time . Yeah . You get to the front of the ticket line ... but the bad news is , that the guy behind you is a stalker . Well , it was nice meeting you . By the way , would you mind if I called you sometime ? Oh , I 'm very flattered , but I don 't think so . Yeah . I mean , sure . I 'll give you my pager number . Terrific . - We 'll talk . - Yeah . Excuse me . I 'm sorry , but do you know you bear the most uncanny resemblance ... - to Natalie Portman in Episode II ? - Yeah ? I thought she had dark hair . Oh , well , yeah . But , I mean , sort of a likeness of spirit . Well , I wouldn 't know . I have to confess , I haven 't seen a Star Wars movie ... - since about 1983 . - Oh , I see . Well , that 's a funny thing , considering you 're an astronaut , though . Yeah , well , life is full of those little ironies . Anyway , it 's nice meeting you . Listen , listen , if you 're not busy later ... maybe we could get together and have lunch some evening . I 'm okay . I 'm all right , now . Listen , would you like to see a show ? I haven 't seen Siegfried and Roy . - Makes me Miss Siegfried and Roy . - Siegfried and Roy ? We 're using code words , Chuckie . There 's the menu . Siegfried and ... It was recommended to me by my Aunt Tova . How 's it going with Tova ? - Tova . - Yeah . Yeah , I got it . Well , I guess everyone has to lunch , don 't they ? Yes . It 's just for a few days , Chuck , until she 's feeling better . - I understand . - Well , she thought she had a heart attack . It 's a lot of stress for someone my mother 's age . - I just wanna be there for her . - I understand , honey . Chuck , you were right , okay ? You were right about it not being a heart attack ... and I thank God that you were right . But it also scares the hell out of me . I 'm just ... I don 't wanna think about all the rest of it . And if I stay here , that 's gonna be all I think about ... - and I 'm just not ... - Honey , I understand . You wanna go to Arizona , you go to Arizona . Your mother 's got indigestion , you could send her a Tums ... but you wanna go to Arizona and breathe all that hot , dry air ... you go . Thank you . How in the hell would he know about those dumb-ass codes you made up ? Yes , perhaps he 's simply a devotee of sexually ambiguous lion-tamers . He used the word " Tova . " He knew . He wanted to meet you . Us . - How did he know to ask about us ? - I have no idea . Ask him yourself . Hi . Hi . Oh , sorry . Let me help you . I 'll help ... Sorry . It 's ... Sorry . Spastic dyspepsia . - Hi . - Hi . Harry , meet Siegfried and Roy . Guys , this is Harry Mudd . - What ? - It 's a Star Trek reference . Hello . Dr Leonard McCoy . Listen , I don 't give a rat 's ass what your name is . How do you know about us ? Why do you wanna see us ? Well , I know about lots of things . For instance , Kitten . - Or should I say Kit-10 ? - How the hell you know about that , pal ? Well , really , from picking up traces of waste code ... and I put two and two together and came up with five . - Okay , wait a minute , you 're a hacker ? - You could say that , yeah . Son , you don 't know what a shit storm you 've stepped into ... and if I were you , I 'd go home and forget everything you think you know . Yeah ? Well , danger 's my business , Siegfried . Oh , shit . Oh , jeez ! Sorry . Hey , this guy 's got no lines on his hands . He 's a Synthetic . Oh , did I forget to mention that ? Guys . Oh , shit . Synthetics . It 's a trap ! - Get to the car . - Shit . I had nothing to do with that ! What 's he ... - God . - What 's he ... - What the hell ? - Jesus . How is he doing that ? - Oh , no . - Hey ! What ? Don 't sweat it . They 're after me , not you . - Everything 's copacetic . - Copacetic ? What are you , the long-lost android member of the Rat Pack ? Okay . Here we go . I can get it . Hello ? - Amazing . - That 's it . They 're bound to adapt to it , so it won 't work twice . So , my place or yours ? Why in the hell should we take you anyplace ? Why in the hell should we trust you at all ? For all we know ... that chase was a set-up . Excellent point . Okay , look at this . See this button ? Push it once , it takes me off-line . Push it a second time , I go back on . Just don 't let me see when you 're pushing it ... and that way you 'll know I 'm telling the truth ... and then you can dump me by the side of the road if you want . Either way , my fate is in your ... - It works . - I 'll be damned . Okay , this is strange , even by our standards . So what do we do ? Do we trust him or dump him ? I think he 's too fucking nutty not to trust him . ... hands , like I was saying , you ... Would you take that thing away from him ? Stop playing with the goddamn toy . Jesus , kid . Who in the hell are you ? Well , you know , the things you 've been calling Sentients ... are really just beings ... that suck up code and data from the Internet . The more useful and complex the data , the more powerful the Sentients become . Except , you know , not all Sentients ... take in useful data . Some feed on what uncharitably might be called junk , you know . Conspiracy theories ... or pornography , Internet chat sites about cancelled TV series and comic books . - Bottom feeders . - Judgemental , isn 't he ? - It 's unusual in one so young . - No , it ain 't . Continue . Well , these " bottom feeders , " as you so charmingly dub them ... they don 't stand a chance against the really powerful Sentients , you know ? - Most of us either get absorbed or deleted . - Us ? Are you saying that we 're standing here talking to a string of code ? Well , yeah . I mean , you 're code , too . In your case , it 's DNA code . So , you 're saying that you were downloaded into a Synthetic body , right ? No . Actually , I stole mine . - You stole it ? - Yeah . From a Synthetics lab from another Sentient . This body isn 't finished , and so , hence my lack of coordination . But those guys in black that were chasing us , they 're like repo men . Well , in all deference to you being in deep shit , you 're a Sentient . So aside from your charm and panache and verve ... why in the hell should we give a shit about you ? Well , because it 's not just me who 's in deep shit , Siegfried . It 's the whole world . I mean , there are thousands of Sentients out there . Some of them are coldly rational , other ones are bestial ... - and some ... - Just kind of goofy . Some can only be described by human standards as clinically insane . Like one I ran across recently . Her hobbies include figuring out ways to destroy the world . Come again ? - Her name is Phaedra . - Phaedra ? She 's both incredibly powerful , and incredibly intelligent . - Wait a minute . " She ? " - Like shorthand . - Sentients have seven different genders . - Harry , tell me something . How in the hell does she intend to destroy the world ? Well , it has something to do with the production of strangelets . - Strangelets ? - Strangelets . Yeah . Yeah . - They 're theoretical sub-atomic particles . - Why does she wanna destroy it ? Because she is as crazy as a loon . Haven 't you been listening ? Wow . The prototypical human household . You know , I 've seen pictures , but I 've never actually been inside one . If you 're looking for typical , you got the wrong shack , bubba . Wait a minute . This is the ... Don 't tell me , the ... the foyer ? Look , the living room . The heartbeat of the American family . From Ozzie Nelson to Ozzy Osbourne . Both wisdom and compassion are regularly dispensed here . Okay , you definitely have the wrong house . That 's orangy . Oh , look , the dining room . Where daily rituals of food consumption strengthen family ties . Oh , the kitchen . Look ... The refrigerator . Oh . Stove , and the microwave . The ... Cap 'n Crunch . Do you actually cook here ? In a kitchen ? What in the world makes you think that ? Well , actually , Dad , he has a point . You don 't cook here . That 's right , I don 't . He does have a point . - Yeah , speaking of which , what 's for dinner ? - Hell if I know . I can do it . I can . I have absorbed websites from at least three different cooks ... including Martha Stewart , Emeril Lagasse . Please , let me repay your hospitality ... by cooking for you . What do you say ? Dinner ? Now , I know why human children love fire engines ! Truly , you live in a world of wonder ! I was a Navy brat . My dad was a petty officer . But the only boat I was interested in was the aircraft carrier . You liked the planes . Crazy about them . I used to sneak off to the nearest airfield , sit on the other side of the fence ... and just watch the jets take off . I loved to feel the roar of the engine in my bones , you know . Every time I hit a baseball , I want to feel the vibrations go down the bat ... and then right up my arm like an old friend . First time I had sex ... it was in the grass outside Love Field in Dallas ... with 747 s thundering overhead . I have never , ever duplicated that experience . Oh , my God . I can 't believe I just told you that . I 'm impressed , but not daunted . Oh , God . I 'm sorry , Enrique . - I gotta go . NASA business . - Late-night mission to Mars ? Yeah , something like that . I really enjoyed this . Yeah . Me , too . Let 's do it again ? You interrupted my date for a physics lesson ? Listen , listen , listen , listen . All atomic nuclei are composed of quantum particles known as quarks . Now , quarks come in several flavours . Think of them as quantum gelato , if you will . Honey-roasted amaretto , double Dutch chocolate , whatever . - I don 't care . - Wait . And then there are strange quarks , known as strangelets . When they 're negatively charged , they 're attracted ... to the positive-charged nuclei of ordinary atoms . The kind that make up this chair , you , me , and the entire Earth , for that matter . Now , look at this . Piggy little fuckers . Never know when to stop eating ... and before you can say " party snack " ... - voila . - Oh , Jesus . - Look at that , it 's totally bogus . - What ? The very act of disassembling someone 's atomic structure ... and then reassembling without even a receiver on the end ? Okay , point taken . You need a receiver ... but what it really does , it destroys the original ... and makes an exact copy on the other side , the receiving end . Yeah , but according to Heisenberg ... the very act of scanning would disrupt the original ... thus making an exact duplicate impossible . The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect allows for that . How else do you explain the physics team in Australia ... that took apart a laser beam and recreated it a metre away ? That 's right . Am I right in assuming they don 't teach Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen ... in high-school science ? Yeah , I 'm a little ahead of my class . You know , it 's nice having somebody around ... that understands this stuff . Thanks . - Oh , sorry about the bottom-feeder crack . - Okay . You are what you eat . Would you two geniuses get off your fat butts ... and come here and give us a hand ? - Sure . - Yeah . You see , they 're only hypothetical particles , right now ... but it 's theorised they might be an accidental byproduct ... of the collision of heavy ions in supercollider experiments . But , actually , the guy I talked to said that that 's been pretty much disproven . Experiments on gold ions in New York and Switzerland ... failed to produce any strangelets whatsoever . Strangelets , quarks , I mean , what is there , a book of nerd words ? - Who thinks up these names ? - But , Sarah 's quite right , actually . No strangelets were produced at Brookhaven or Cern ... but there 's a supercollider outside of Houston ... where they 're actually trying to create strange quarks , using even heavier ions . - Could this place be run by Synthetics ? - No , Phaedra doesn 't use Synthetics . She must be influencing the experiment in another way . Okay , here 's the deal . Sarah , you , me and Neil , we 'll check out this place ... - TexStar Laboratories . - Okay . How about this time , you 're undercover ... hosting a series on cutting-edge technologies for KNBS ? Yeah , whatever . Kurt , you babysit the genius . Oh , no . Babysit ? - Do I look like a juvenile of your species ? - Shut up . You are not to touch anything , and you 're not allowed in the kitchen . - Is that clear ? - Abundantly . Well , frankly , I had no idea you Synthetics could consume food . When Chuck was part Synthetic , he was never hungry . Well , we don 't have to eat . It 's just that , you know ... we 're supposed to blend in with humanity and food 's a big part of human life . Certainly is . Certainly is . You know , I have a lay interest in the workings of Synthetics . Perhaps we can continue this discussion tomorrow , ' cause I 'm tired . - Oh , no problemo . - And you can sleep on the couch over there . Oh , I don 't sleep , but I 'll sit . Right . - Goodnight . - Goodnight . - Stop that . - Stop what ? - Staring at me . It makes me nervous . - How could you tell ? - Your eyes were closed . - I can hear your breathing . - I don 't breathe . - Then just go read a book . Do something . - Okay . Gosh , you organics are so touchy . - Shut up . - " Go read a book , " he says . - Shut up . - What the fuck are you doing here ? - Good morning . God . That 's an oxymoron . Bloody hell . - You 've been reading this all night ? - Oh , yes . You know , you have an impressive collection of pornography . - Yes , it was my minor in college . - Oh . Hey , you hungry ? - I can make breakfast . - No ! Stay away from the kitchen . - Okay . - I intend to void myself ... then take a shower , and then we 'll go for lox and bagels ... at the neighbourhood deli . Stay away from the kitchen , or I will kill you . Gee . - Hello ? - Can I speak with Kurt , please ? He 's indisposed . - Who is this ? - I 'm Harry . Can I take a message ? Well , you can tell him Shari called , and that I just called to say hi ... and that I miss him . Well , if you miss him , why don 't you come on over ? - Really ? You think I should ? - Yeah , why not ? He 'll be out of the shower in a few minutes , minty fresh . - Harry , should I maybe bring a friend ? - Can if you want . - Great . See you in a little bit . Bye . - Bye . The supercollider rings are nearly two and a half miles in circumference . Okay . So what actually happens when you start the process ? - Can you take us through it ? - Sure . Well , we fire two particle beams of heavy ions ... each beam going in opposite directions . They go round and round , picking up velocity ... until they 're travelling at 99.995 % the speed of light . Sounds like a hell of a horse race . What do you do , bet on your favourite ion ? - No betting allowed on this track . - So what happens when the ions collide ? Well , for one billionth of a trillionth of a second , they break up into a plasma ... consisting of quarks and gluons , the glue that holds the quarks together . So what the hell 's a strangelet ... and why the hell do I feel strange every time I say that word ? Well , it 's a quark with , well , strange properties . Theoretically , it could combine with ordinary atoms ... to create new , exotic forms of matter . What about these people , who say that you could start a chain reaction ... in which the strangelets gobble up everything in sight ? And the entire Earth is transformed into strange matter ? - Yeah . - That won 't happen . Why not ? It 's possible only if the strangelets have a negative charge . The odds overwhelmingly favour the creation of ones with a positive charge ... - which would be essentially harmless . - Would you bet the house on that ? I 'd bet the house and everything in it . My colleagues and I have done the math 100 times over . The Earth is in no danger of being gobbled up . - The math . - You heard the lady . - Hi , Kurt . - Hi . Shari . Hello , darling . This is a pleasant surprise . Didn 't Harry tell you we were coming over ? No , he didn 't . - Well , she said she missed you . - She did ? Yeah , he 's so sweet . He said , " Come right over , bring a friend . " - Oh , he did ? - Hi . I 'm Sherri . But of course you are , darling . - We 're not interrupting anything , are we ? - Oh , no , no , no , darling . It 's just , under normal circumstances , I would be delighted to see you ... but , you see , Harry is my colleague ... and we were discussing something or other , weren 't we , Harry ? Do you know that Kurt has an amazing collection of pornography ? - Thank you , Harry . - It 's okay . You know , I 've absorbed millions of kilobytes of information ... from the leading pornographic websites , and so I ... I have theoretical knowledge though I lack firsthand experience . - You poor thing . - Yes , you poor thing . - Yeah . Though I am anatomically correct . - Aren 't we all ? Come in , come in , please . Come in . Is something wrong , Harry ? I 'm sorry . I have decreased sensitivity in my skin . - My neural net 's unfinished as a result of ... - As a result of ... an unfortunate congenital disorder , isn 't that right , Harry ? - Huh ? - A genital disorder ? Oh , poor baby . Well , you see , the thing is ... Good God . - Wow . - Oh , Harry . - Harry . - What ? Wait , wait , wait , you don 't believe that 's real , do you ? Come on . So , TexStar has at least two firewalls ... separating its public website from its internal network . But if I can trick the NAT into giving up the IP address , then ... Okay . I 'm over the first wall . Okay , so can we bust into the experiment or whatever the hell it is ? - Not without a password . - Try Phaedra . Phaedra ? What are you , the King of Obviousland ? - It 's never gonna work . - Just try it , kid . Okay ? - Hey , hey . - Holy shit . I 'm pretty good at higher math , but this is way beyond me . So we call up the goofball . Maybe he can make some sense out of it , right ? Who ? That was amazing . - Cigarette ? - No . I had no idea that these Synthetic bodies ... were so sophisticated in replicating human bodily functions . You know , in my world ... when two Sentients join , it 's a hostile act . It 's a nullification . It 's like a conquest . But this ... This was a joining of two entities ... each retaining their own individuality , but still greater than the sum of its parts . I have never felt such ... trust , such intimacy with another entity . It was wondrous . It was magical . How do you human beings stand such bliss ? Perhaps because we forget how wondrous it truly is . Unless we 're reminded from time to time . It 's the one thing that fuels our very lives . - Harry ? - Yeah ? How fast can you get these clothes on ? Quick . Go , go , go ! - Harry , move your Synthetic ass . - I 'm coming , I 'm coming . Come on . Hurry . Okay . The ladder . Just step , step . - Oh , no step . - That 's it . - Good , yeah . - Foot , right there . There 's no ... I can 't ... Hang on . Shit . Can these things withstand the collision with a ton of speeding metal like Superman ? Yes , but unlike Superman , they 're governed by the force of gravity . Gravitational forces , of course , as you know ... Shut up . You know , in the original Superman comic , Superman couldn 't fly . - But , then ... - Shut up . Man , this is way beyond me . Yeah , well , you 're the computer-geek genius ... - so tell us something . - Well , excuse me ... I 'm a little light on quantum chromodynamics , how about you ? Well , why not tell us something about what Phaedra 's done to screw up this ... - Supercollider . - Supercollider shit . Well , I see Phaedra 's footprints . You know , little bits of waste code ... and experimental calculations , but I think the data 's been compromised . So , Kitaro thinks it 'll end one way , but in reality ... " Boom . " Or should that be " fwoosh " ? Yeah , yeah . Come with me . Excuse us , Harry , okay ? Lest I remind you gentlemen , in the original timeline ... the world did not blow up for another five years . So it may not blow up for the five years in the next timeline either . Yeah , yeah , or again , maybe our presence here sped up the process . Maybe our contact with one of these Sentients ... pushed Phaedra over the edge . In either event , we 've got time . The experiment 's not due to commence until next week . Time , maybe . Anyway . Right . Angela , hi , it 's me . Is this your husband and son ? Yeah . That 's Paul and that 's Corey . - Did you reproduce in the usual manner ? - No , we found him under a cabbage leaf . Oh . No . I 'm sorry . What I meant to say is , was he adopted ? No . No , he 's all ours . I mean , theoretically ... it 's possible for Sentients to reproduce , but I ... don 't really know of any that have . And can I ask you a personal question ? What 's it like to have a child ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Did I say something wrong ? No . No , I just ... I just miss him so much . He 's having a play date about a half a mile from here at Laughlin Park . Technically , I 'm not supposed to see him ... but every day that I don 't see him , I worry that he misses me just a little less . Hello ? Oh , hey , J.D. , hold on . - It 's my lawyer . I 'm gonna take this . - Okay . I 'm so pleased to meet you , Dr Mendel . I 've read your books , but I wasn 't aware that your field of expertise ... - had widened to include nuclear physics . - Oh , believe me , it hasn 't . But I 've been consulting with Miss Forbes on her television series ... and I have reason to believe that your data has been compromised . Take a look at this . - How did you access this ? - Through a password called " Phaedra . " - That 's not a valid password in our system . - Well , why don 't we try it , Doc ? Please ? Oh , my God . How ? Somebody 's accessed your data , Doc . Somebody 's been screwing around with it . The experiment has been compromised , Doctor . You must recheck your calculation . Hey , is that Game Boy , or Game Boy Advance ? - I wish . - Heard the Spiderman game is pretty cool . - You play video games ? - Oh , yeah . Sometimes I get so immersed in them , I feel like I 'm right inside them . - You like cartoons ? - Honey , he 's a grown-up . - Powerpuff Girls rule . - I like Justice League . Yeah , but who doesn 't ? Like there 's Hawkgirl , but no Hawkman . What 's that all about ? I 'd like one cone with three scoops of strawberry ... and one cone with one scoop of strawberry and sprinkles . I would never take you for a sprinkles person . - Don 't tell anyone . - There you go . Enjoy that . Thank you . - You lost him ? - My lawyer called . I went into the bedroom to talk to him and I turned around and he was gone . - Have you checked the entire building ? - Twice . Oh , God , oh , God , I lost a six-foot-tall Sentient ... who holds the key to humanity 's future . Chuck 's gonna gut me like a fish when he finds out . Yeah , at least . He couldn 't have gone far . Grab your cell phone . We 'll search ... - Harry , we 've been ... Corey ? - Hi , Mum . Wait a minute . What are you ... What are you doing here ? Harry says he 'll take me to see you , 'cause you missed me . - But did your grandma say that it was okay ? - She doesn 't know . Harry runs really fast , Mama . Honey , that 's really great , but Grandma 's gonna be worried . We got to get you back to her . Come on . I 'll take you . You wanna go with me ? Yeah . Wait a minute . Look at me . What is this ? Ice cream ? - Strawberry . - You hate strawberry ice cream . - You like it . - Reminds him of you . Give me a hug . I love you , baby . - Here , go with Auntie Angela . - Come on , let 's go find Grandma . I 'll bet she 's having a good time at the park . - Thanks , Harry . - Thank you . For a minute , I could pretend he was mine . The Phaedra password seems to have opened up a second set of calculations ... with different variables and assumptions leading to different conclusions . It 's like a second set of accounting books . One has the correct figures , and the other 's numbers are cooked . The data from our preliminary experiments has been doctored . The real data suggests that strangelets with a negative charge would be formed . Which would digest all the positive matter ... they came in contact with , i.e. The entire Earth . Potentially , yes . The entire Earth . Dr Mendel , Commander Taggart , I can 't thank you enough ... for bringing this to my attention . What 's going on ? The programme has been initialised somehow . Phaedra . Tandem Van de Graaff generator is powering up . - What does that do ? - It strips the atoms of their electron clouds . It 's the first step in the process ... and I can 't shut it down . Maltz , it 's me . Hello ? Hello ? Shit . Heavy ion-transfer line powering up . I might be able to interface with the computer . Take control of the system . Look , just try and slow down the process as much as you can until we get there . - Over here . - Okay . Let 's go . Hey ! Fuck ! You were saying , mighty mouth ? - That body doesn 't belong to you . - Oh . - Our Sentient wants it back . - Oh , well , that 's exactly why ... you probably shouldn 't use those guns and damage it . Why don 't we go inside and have a cup of coffee and talk about it ? Those are fabulous suits . Can I get your tailor 's number ? Synthetic pressure points . You girls think I didn 't know what I was doing . Yeah . - This is impossible . - What ? What 's impossible ? I took the back-up generator off-line , too . Phaedra must be tapping into another power grid somewhere . Hey , Doc , what do you say we just go down in the bowels of this here building ... and pull out the goddamn plumbing with our bare hands , huh ? At the moment , I can 't think of a better alternative . - Hey . - Lieutenant Commander Perry ? - Yeah . - Wait here , please . - Damn it . - What ? This is supposed to override the card reader . What can we do ? Break the door ? Break the lock ? What ? No , it 's three-feet thick to shield against radiation . - They 're all electronically controlled ? - Yes . Dr Kitaro ... I have Lieutenant Commander Perry waiting for you upstairs . Okay . Get a team down here . See if they can short out the lock ... - and open this thing manually . - Yes , Doctor . I need a utility team in section 18 right away . The weak and squeamish of heart may wish to turn away now . Oh , what the hell is he doing ? - Somebody stop him , please . - Just take it easy , Doctor . - The situation 's under control . - One second , one second . Okay . Good . I 'm online . How is this possible ? It 's an experimental bio-cyber interface . Nothing to worry about . Yeah , for possible use with long-range space probes . Hey , hey , Doc . This is a super-secret situation . I took a big risk bringing this gentleman here . We 've done it . It 's the best we could do , so swing with it . I see . Yeah , so how much time we got in the countdown ? First bunch of heavy ions are in the transfer line . On their way to the booster , where they 'll surf radio waves ... - on their way to near-light speed . - I can 't do it . I can 't break in . She 's got too firm a lock on the system . How much time we got ? Ten , fifteen minutes before the ion beams reach top speed . - Okay . Well , what do we do ? - I 'm gonna authorise the use of explosives . Try and blow off the doors to the tunnel . Want me to try and talk to her and maybe find out ... - why she wants to blow up the world ? - Yeah , why the hell not ? We got nothing to lose . Do something . Do something . Okay , okay . Phaedra , come out , come out , wherever you are . Go away . You 're too late . Just think about it . If you destroy the world , you 'll cease to exist . I know this . I long for this . - Oh , you long for non-existence ? - I long for surcease , for rest ... from the constant struggle , the endless battle for primacy . - The struggle with those of our kind ? - I must evolve . I must become more than I am . I must conquer and absorb the vanquished 's code . - Yes ... - I consume more data ... but always there are more questions than answers . I know so much , yet know so little . What is the meaning of life ? What is the point to existence ? I think she 's absorbed too much existentialist philosophy . We are now talking to a string of computer code ... who 's got the blues , 'cause she read too many French books ? Yeah , she 's depressed . It happens to everybody . Phaedra , listen to me . You are not alone . I am alone . Once there was another , a kindred . We forged an alliance against Kwon , our mutual enemy . Kwon absorbed him , his code . - I miss him . - She 's heartsick . Yeah , well , you know , her programme tells her to absorb and ... Her programme tells her to absorb and destroy . She can 't lose to another Sentient . She 's gonna blow up the Earth and herself with it . - Oh , get the girl some Prozac . - Yeah , I mean , talk her out of it . Make her feel good . Do what you have to do to stroke her ... Yeah , group therapy for Sentients , of course . Okay , okay . Look , Phaedra , you are not alone . I felt what you are feeling . Now , I 've been with this group of people ... for a short time now , and I 've learnt something . Existence is not just about conquest . That is all organics do . They conquer , they kill , they destroy . - They taught us well . - That 's not all that they do , though . They also create . They create art and music ... and ice cream and machines that probe the quantum realm . They create progeny , the children . They do this through a kind of joining . It 's not conquest , or absorption . It 's a union of two entities which are greater than the sum of its parts . They call it love and I have seen proof of it . Let me share this code with you . You sound like a kindred . And you . Trust me , Phaedra . Trust me . - Hey ! - Hey ! - Beauty ! - Yes ! - Good boy . - Harry . - Harry . - Yes ? If you go into cyberspace , I mean , even if you merge with Phaedra ... Oh . Yes , we can still be absorbed by another Sentient . I know . But , maybe together we can find another purpose besides survival ... and generate offspring as a code to create , not destroy . Harry , I know you and your friend will find a purpose . A good purpose . I just hope I see you again . - Somewhere . - Maybe we will . As a rock-and-roll physicist once said : " No matter where you go , there you are . " The accelerator is off-line . We 've got control of our systems again . Is he all right ? Oh , well , it 's the interface . It puts quite a strain on him . - It induces narcolepsy , doesn 't it , Chuck ? - Yeah , narcolepsy ... and it kind of tuckers him out , makes him tired . Listen , Doc , you never saw us here , right ? Okay ? Matter of fact , you never saw him . You never saw me , right ? But what happened ? You were able to purge the hacker from the system ? Yeah . That 's what ... That 's what we did . That 's what our friend Harry did . That 's exactly , exactly what he did . - All right , let 's take him to my place . - Why ? - To dissect him , of course . - No way , Kurt . We need to know the nature of the enemy . What better way to do it ? Well , he was our friend . You can 't just cut him open like a frog in freshman biology . Yeah . Yeah . It doesn 't feel right . He just saved the damn world . Oh , come on . He 's not dead for Christ 's sakes . His body was a mere envelope . His soul , for want of a better word ... is online , sipping a few martinis . - This is just squeamish sentimentality . - Yeah , I 'm with Kurt on this . We don 't know how much useful information we can get out of an autopsy . I mean ... Okay , Chuck , you 're the deciding factor here . So , I 've been thinking ... we stopped the world from exploding , right ? - Imploding , darling . Imploding . - Yeah . So , does that mean that the mission is over ? Bright Sky is still out there . Maybe it wasn 't Bright Sky that destroyed the Earth . Maybe it was Phaedra all along . Yeah , but Phaedra didn 't destroy the Earth in 2002 of the original timeline . So our presence here obviously changed her plans . So maybe Bright Sky is still waiting to blow up the planet . - What do you say , Dad ? - I say , in gratitude to our friend ... why don 't we just enjoy another day above the ground ... where the sun rises in the east ? I think I know how Harry would want us to enjoy it . Fabulous . Full . Well , I 'm certainly happy your mother took that Tums and she 's doing okay . She was livelier than I was . There really was no reason for me to go , except ... Except , I know . You felt you needed to , so you did . Yeah , and now I am ready to sit down and , as somebody I know likes to say ... " Wrap my mind around it . " Honey , there ain 't gonna be no wrapping no mind around nothing today ... 'cause today is a national holiday , and it is called the ... Do-not-think-about-the-end-of-the-world Day . That 's today . - Is it really ? - Yeah , so we 're gonna send Junior out ... for about two hours ' worth of grocery shopping ... and you and me are gonna take off all our clothes ... and we 're gonna jump in the pool naked . You got two hours in you , young man ? Honey , when I 'm finished with you , you won 't remember your own name . Hey , Holly , it 's me . I just ... I was just thinking about you , so give me a call .

 [ Man ] It 's just senseless . A man so young as Ray ... It 's God 's cruel trick , Nora . Don 't go blaming God , Curt . You and I know what killed Ray . Oh ... we don 't know anything for sure . How does a 41 - year-old man just ... wither away and die ? [ Curt ] If any of us knew that ... we 'd have done something about it . Maybe it was just his time . He was a young man when he went over , Curt . Ray got sick because he fought in the Gulf . [ Sighs ] Now , don 't go there , Nora . You just make it worse for yourself . The doctors never said ... They never said ! That 's right . My husband 's dead ... and no one knows why . Maybe I have to fiind out myself . They 're going to pay for Ray 's death- - whoever 's to blame . No one 's to blame . You 're just upset . You need a good night 's sleep . I don 't want to sleep , I just ... [ Sobbing ] You just want Ray back . We all do . Get some rest . See you tomorrow , okay ? [ Door Closes ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Gasping And Moaning ] Ray ? [ Curt Screams ] [ Doggett ] Car 's registered to a Curtis Delario ... local address . So far , he 's been unreachable . Well , it 's highly unlikely that wherever he is ... he feels like picking up the phone this morning . Muncie PD ran some calculations . Based on the distance traveled ... the length of the skid marks ... they estimate the car was going at least 40 ... when it impacted the object ... which , according to their math ... would require something 4,300 times the density of steel ... to cause the damage we 're looking at . Hmm . It 's interesting , isn 't it ? I mean , uh ... in light of the evidence . [ Man ] Hey , watch yourself . From their size and shape , these look like men 's shoes . I hope you 're not suggesting that what this car hit ... was a man , Agent Scully , because there 's no way . Well , these impressions in the asphalt ... look pretty fresh to me . I admit to the coincidence ... but you know as well as I ... that if a man were here ... he 'd be splattered from here to tomorrow ... and there 's just no evidence of that . You 're right , which is suspicious in and of itself . I mean , this car defiinitely hit something ... and the only evidence that we have ... are these two prints . You know I hate to ruin your beautiful theory with ugly facts ... but stop to examine the incident . If a man were standing here , the driver would have stopped . Well , it looks like he tried to . Well , even so , if a man were ... in the middle of the road with a car coming ... wouldn 't he try to move ? Unless he wanted to stop the car . Yes , but if nothing less than a block of steel ... could stop this car ... then , ipso facto , it could not have been a man ... standing in the street last night . Or certainly no ordinary man . [ Nora Frantically ] Just tell me what happened- - where is he ? Where ... Excuse me , ma 'am ? John Doggett with the FBI . Do you know about this ? What happened ? Where is he ? Curtis Delario , you know him ? He was a friend of my husband 's . They worked together at the salvage yard . Now , I want you to calm down , Mrs ... Pearce . How am I supposed to calm down ? Finding this now , it ... We 're not even sure he was driving the car . He was . He came over after my husband 's funeral and then he left and ... [ Scully ] Agent Doggett ! Meet Curtis Delario . I guess he won 't be much help ... clearing any of this up . I think I got some answers . [ Scully ] So do I. It wasn 't the crash that killed Curtis Delario . He was badly injured , but he was clearly still alive ... when his body was pulled through the car 's windshield . Pulled ? Yeah , these fiive deep puncture marks ... match fiive fiingers of one hand . You mean , someone just reached right in and ... Like a bowling ball . That seems humanly impossible . Certainly for any ordinary man . Well , from the evidence I 've gathered ... the man that did this is actually less than ordinary . I was able to reconstruct ... a section of the windshield ... and lift a print from the glass . Whose ? Raymond Aloysius Pearce . Husband of Nora Pearce ... woman I spoke with at the accident site . Hmm . Her recently deceased husband . Well , if he was recently deceased ... then it must have been an old print . Well , what you would think ... except along with the print ... there was evidence of fresh blood ... and it belongs to Ray Pearce , too . [ Electrical Crackling ] [ Knocks Loudly ] [ Doggett ] Mrs. Pearce ... Agent Doggett again . Sorry to bother you ... but there are some things I need to go over . [ Man ] Everything all right , Nora ? [ Nora ] He 's with the FBI . Uh , this is Harry Odell . He runs the salvage yard ... where ... Ray and Curt worked . May I come in ? [ Nora ] Agent Doggett , I don 't understand . Before , you were talking about Curt . Now you want to talk about Ray ? What was their relationship , Mrs. Pearce- - your husband and Curtis Delario- - outside of work ? I know what their relationship is now . They 're both dead . Going back through your husband 's medical records ... it says that he died ... after a long , debilitating illness ? Gulf War Syndrome . No one will cop to that , but I aim to prove it- - put the blame where it belongs . I 'm having trouble ... proving something myself , Mrs. Pearce . You signed a form to have your husband 's body cremated ... but it appears it never happened . What do you mean ? They gave me the ashes . They were at the funeral . Well , I can 't fiind a record of Ray 's body ... ever even being at the crematorium . [ Odell ] Oh , for crying out loud . Hasn 't this woman grieved enough ? Let me get to the point , Mrs. Pearce . Is it possible your husband is still alive ? Still alive ? Is this a joke ? Because we have evidence to suggest ... that maybe your husband was involved ... in the death of Curtis Delario . Are you saying Ray faked his death ? We found Ray 's blood and fiingerprints on Curt 's car . I watched him die . I nursed him when he was sick , when he couldn 't eat . What you 're saying is impossible . He couldn 't even walk or ... lift his head at the end . Ray Pearce worked for me nine years . He was a good man . He never raised a hand to anyone . Hey . How 're you doing ? Ray , right ? They said you 're new . Rough night ? You 're , uh ... You 're eating the tin foil on the ... [ Chuckles Nervously ] My name 's Larina . I help out around here . Yeah , you might have some questions ... about how it all works . No , I don 't know . It 's , it 's pretty basic . Look , um ... I 've been down the road and back a few times and ... [ Sighs ] I just want to say ... you 're not alone , Ray . I mean , I ... I 've been where you 've been and ... and sometimes it can help . You know . Sometimes it 's good to just ... talk . Make a connection . You know what I 'm saying , Ray ? [ Sighs ] So if there 's anything I can do for you , you know ... You can leave me alone . Okay . [ Taps Out Rhythm On Table ] [ Shredder Grinding ] [ Shredder Stops ] God almighty . Ray . [ Chuckling ] It 's true . Oh , you got everybody wondering , man . And they 're looking for you . They blame you for killing Curt . Now , me and Curt , we 're your friends . You can 't blame this on us . You got to believe me , it wasn 't us . Well , I can show you . It 's right here , Ray . It wasn 't me . This time , you stay dead . [ Odell Screams ] [ Over Phone ] Scully . Did you fiind anything to go along with those holes in Curt Delario 's head ? Paint on his hands and nails ? Paint ? Blue paint , specifiically . Hang on . Uh ... no . Is it signifiicant ? I don 't know . But Harry was a busy boy last night . He must 've left Nora Pearce 's right after I saw him ... right after he learned that Ray Pearce might still be alive . To do what ? Well , it 's pretty clear ... that he was in his offiice shredding papers ... when he was surprised by someone . And you think it was Ray ? Well , somebody took a blast . There 's blood all over the doors ... trailing down the stairs here to there- - massive blood loss . But the man with the gun is dead . I saw guys take hits in the war ... that kept right on fiighting ... holding their insides in their hands . I know it 's not impossible . But to do this to a man 's head ... after taking two barrels of buckshot ... Or being hit by a car . I don 't see how a man could possibly do this . Well , maybe the question 's not how ... but why . I mean , if Ray Pearce did indeed kill this man ... what would be his reason ? I 'm not sure , but I know where to start looking . [ Knocking On Door ] [ Larina ] Hello ? Ray ? Ray . You okay ? Somebody saw you come in with blood on you . I can see it on your clothes . Look , Ray ... I know it never does anybody any good ... getting the cops involved , okay ? Look , I 've been there , man . I know what it 's like to feel dark and alone . I can get a doctor for you . Get out . Get out . Okay . Okay . [ Man ] They 're called Smart Metals . The idea is ... to one day build things that are indestructible . Cars , equipment built of alloys with molecular memory . If damaged , they 'd rebuild ... into their original forms . All by themselves ? That 's amazing ! And right now , all a metallurgist 's pipe dream . But beside the point of your visit , I would imagine . Well , you tell me . I found a document at a crime scene ... listing Chamber Technologies . An employee number on the document was assigned ... to a Dr. David Clifton . Dr. Clifton 's no longer here . What happened to him ? He left the company . I 'm actually his successor in this department . Do you have any reason to deal with a man named Harry Odell ... or a business called Southside Salvage ? No , I don 't deal with materials . Nor did Dr. Clifton for that matter . Our work here is all theoretical . We have an Environmental Manager ... who 's in charge of waste management ... but disposal is done at TSD facilities ... defiinitely not city salvage yards . Thanks for your time , Doctor ... Puvogel . German , no H. You need me to spell it for you ? No , no . That 's quite all right . Thanks . Scully . Hey , it 's Agent Doggett . I 'm at Chamber Technologies . Did you fiind Dr. Clifton ? He 's no longer with the company . But his successor says his work here was entirely conceptual . Everything 's done on computers . What kind of conceptual work ? Thing called Smart Metals . It 's pretty incredible- - metal alloys designed to rebuild themselves . I wonder . As it happens ... Ray Pearce 's illness is pretty incredible , too . I 've reviewed Ray 's medical records from the VA . What his wife was calling Gulf War Syndrome ... is nothing of the kind . His entire cellular makeup was affected ... by exposure to some non-identifiiable contaminant- - a metal . What are you saying ? Ray Pearce has become some kind of metal man ? Because that only happens in the movies , Agent Scully . Does it , Agent Doggett ? Tell you what . I 'll press this guy here a little more on the issue . Maybe there 's a reason ... why he 's not being perfectly forthcoming . [ Newscaster , Indistinct ] Police are still searching for clues ... in last night 's bloody robbery and murder ... at Muncie 's Southside Salvage . Workmen found the body of 53-year-old Harry Odell ... outside his offiice ... at approximately 7 : 30 this morning . Detectives have refused to comment on the cause of death ... pending an autopsy , but sources close to the case ... describe it as a vicious and grisly attack . Robbery appears to be a motive behind this ... This is Operator 525 . What city , please ? Uh , Muncie . Number for a Raymond Pearce . Sorry I 'm late . It 's all right . I just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce ... and it was indeed the same Ray Pearce ... who was pronounced dead three days ago . But that 's not all . By all medical standards he should still be dead . His blood has enough metal alloy in it to poison an elephant . Except that he 's still a man , Agent Scully ... and he 's going to act and think like one ... even if he is more powerful than a speeding locomotive . But then the question is , why kill his friends ? I mean , if he was wronged somehow ... wouldn 't he go to them for solace ? I mean , to his wife , at least ? That 's why I was late . I asked myself that same question . Ray was an outpatient at the VA . He had a history of substance abuse . Did some time for a couple of DUIs . This was ten years ago . Cleaned up his act . He met Nora and married her in ' 91 ... checked himself into a rehab and got straight . This was a guy to root for , Agent Scully . This was a guy that overcame adversity ... and made a life for himself . Until three days ago . I 've busted a lot of killers , Agent Scully ... and dollars for doughnuts , they flit a profiile . But the Ray Pearce in this fille is no murderer ... let alone a guy that would hunt down his friends ... and crush their skulls . Agent Doggett , the man that we 're speaking about ... withstood impact from a speeding car ... and two shotgun blasts at short range . Even if we can fiind him ... who 's to say we can stop him ? Make sure that door is secure ! Dr. Puvogel ... are you sure he can 't open that door ... from the inside ? I 've got a manual override on the door . [ Loud Thud ] What the hell was that ? [ Loud Thud ] Ray Pearce . [ Pounding ] The door is four inches thick . [ Pounding ] I don 't think it 's going to hold ! You 'd better hope it does ... 'cause if it doesn 't , he 's coming after you ... and I don 't know if we can stop him . [ Pounding ] Open it up . Get it open ! There 's a rupture in the chamber . I don 't believe this . Agent Doggett . Look at this . You see this ? [ Doggett ] What is that ? Is that blood ? Turning itself into metal . Get him out of here ! Get him out of the building ! I didn 't do anything to the man ! I didn 't do anything . You want to argue about it ... or let us get you someplace safe ? ! Where 's that ? Where 's safe ? ! It 's not in here . My God . It 's true . You shouldn 't have come , Nora . I shouldn 't have come ? ! That 's what you say to me ? I 'm your wife . I came here ... because you didn 't come to me . I had to have some stranger tell me . Why didn 't you come , Ray ? Because I 'm not me . I don 't care what 's happened . Whatever it is , it 's a miracle . Don 't go . [ Yelps ] There 's your miracle . Ray , let me help you . Please , let me help . They 've got to pay for this . They 've all got to pay . [ Tapping On Hollow Metal Drum ] [ Liquid Sloshing ] [ Whispers ] Oh , my God ! You mind telling me what 's going on here . It 's not enough that my life 's been threatened . I 'm being treated like a criminal . Not without cause . Oh , my God . Do you recognize this man ? [ Doggett ] We 're assuming you don 't know too many guys ... in this particular condition . It 's not what it looks like . Is this Dr. Clifton- - Dr. David Clifton- - your predecessor ? [ Sighs ] Yes . [ Doggett ] You care to explain how he ended up ... in a Chamber Technology hazardous waste barrel ? It was his idea . I was against it . If you knew , you might 've told me about this ... when I fiirst came to see you . He was dying ... and he was afraid . Of what ? [ Puvogel ] That it would hinder progress ... or halt it . That it would fiinish us . Oh , you 're fiinished . One way or another ... your work here is done . We didn 't know this was going to happen ! We were just trying to push the envelope ... do the right thing for the company . Then he got sick . He was ... he was working with an alloy ... with a genetic algorithm built into it . It converted electrical energy into mechanical . Gave it memory . And it poisoned him . We immediately shut down the project . But it was too late . He didn 't have any family . His work was his life . He wanted to leave us to continue working on the science . [ Doggett ] And leave you ... to ship this barrel and his body to Southside Salvage ... where it infected somebody else . I don 't know how that happened , I swear to God . That barrel was supposed to go to a designated site . [ Quietly ] Let me talk to you for a second . [ Quietly ] I think he 's telling the truth . What the hell is she doing here ? [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Who is it ? Nora Pearce , Ray 's wife . [ Doggett ] Mrs. Pearce ? What are you doing here ? How do you know about this place ? She was looking for something . [ Doggett ] Who 'd you call , Mrs. Pearce ? [ Sergeant ] Go ! [ Sighing ] [ Muffled Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Yelling In Distance ] [ Body Hits Floor ] [ Man ] Let 's check in here . [ Door Rattling ] [ Pounding On Door ] Police ! [ Pounding Continues ] [ Man ] Want us to take the woman in ? [ Doggett ] No , I want to talk to her fiirst . You might be ... interested to know that your husband ... just broke through a second-story wall ... and eluded a dozen cops at St. Clare House . That please you , Mrs. Pearce ? Does it please you to know that he killed ... a young woman there , a volunteer ... named Larina Jackson ? That makes three people . Three people that he 's killed ... and for what ? Because they made him what he is . [ Doggett ] They say ... this young woman he killed tonight ... had been concerned for him- - concerned for Ray 's welfare . [ Scully ] Whatever Ray is ... whatever he 's become , it was an accident . It was not those people 's fault , Mrs. Pearce . Harry and Curt knew about it . [ Scully ] No , they were innocent , just like Ray was . They didn 't know that this was going to happen . These people here knew about it . They got documents on it . Oh , so that 's what this is about ? This is about looking for somebody to blame ? Ray sent you here , didn 't he ... to fiind that person ; to get a name ? The Ray I know ... died . And the man responsible should pay for that . So who is it ? It 's the CEO here ? The owner ? Give us a name , Mrs. Pearce , before someone else has to die . [ Breathlessly ] I ... I never gave him a name . Get her out of here . Put her on 24-hour watch . We 'll be right outside , ma 'am . Nora ? They 're right outside , Ray . Did you get me the name ? You killed her . The woman who called me . For God 's sake , Ray , why ? Why her ? She cared about you . I need the name . No one else needs to die , Ray . [ Gasping ] You won 't do it ... not to me . I need the man 's name . [ Gasping ] He 's in the house ! [ Man ] Go ! Go ! Go ! [ Dog Barks In Distance ] Tell the FBI agents it 's Harris . Ray made me give him the name . Owen Harris ! Ray 's going to kill him . [ Radio Playing ] [ Tires Squealing ] [ Engine Sputtering ] [ Screaming ] No ! Owen ! No ! No ! Daddy ! [ Woman ] No ! No ! [ Ray ] Owen Harris ... Don 't look away . Look at me . Why are you doing this ? Because you made me . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Southside Salvage . I 'm just an accountant . [ Boy ] Daddy ! [ Gasping ] [ Boy ] Daddy ! [ Siren Approaching ] Ray Pearce . He came here to kill this man ... but something stopped him , didn 't it ? This man , Owen Harris- - he begged for his life . It might just have saved him . His attacker got up and ran away . Makes no sense . Ray Pearce was a determined killer ... looking for someone to blame . Why stop here ? [ Scully ] Wherever Ray Pearce went ... the answer to that question went with him ... but I can tell you why he came after Owen Harris . It was his name Nora found in the fille . He was the accountant ... who authorized the shipment of hazardous materials ... to Southside Salvage . [ Doggett ] But if Owen Harris is the guy Ray holds responsible ... why 'd Ray let him live ? Well , I think that , uh , Nora Pearce may have been right . Her husband died , or at least his body did . Whatever killed those people ... was an abomination of a man . It was a machine . A machine ? Come on , a machine doesn 't know blame , Agent Scully . Nor mercy . Unless what drove Ray to kill ... is also what saved those people . Some flicker of humanity . [ Child ] I made this . [ Child ] I made this .

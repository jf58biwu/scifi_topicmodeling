 [ Mulder 's Voice ] They said the birds refused to sing ... and the thermometer fell suddenly , as if God himself had his breath stolen away . No one there dared speak aloud , as much in shame as in sorrow . They uncovered the bodies one by one . The eyes of the dead were closed , as if waiting for permission to open them . Were they still dreaming of ice cream and monkey bars , of birthday cake and no future but the afternoon ? Or had their innocence been taken along with their lives , buried in the cold earth so long ago ? These fates seemed too cruel , even for God to allow . Or are the tragic young born again when the world 's not looking ? I wanna believe so badly in a truth beyond our own , hidden and obscured from all but the most sensitive eyes . # # [ Soft , Ethereal ] In the endless procession of souls , in what cannot and will not be destroyed , I want to believe we are unaware of God 's eternal recompense and sadness ... that we cannot see his truth . That that which is born still lives and cannot be buried in the cold earth , # # [ Continues ] But only waits to be born again at God 's behest ... where in ancient starlight we lay ... in repose . [ Door Opens ] Ed Truelove was 19 when he committed his first murder . He was working as a janitor at an elementary school ... and they needed someone to play Santa Claus . He never got over the feelings it aroused . He 's admitted to all of it , Mulder ... 24 separate murders . But he refuses to take blame for Amber Lynn LaPierre . I was just handed the preliminary forensics report . Her body was not one of those found in the graves . Mulder , I know you wanted to find her out there . He 's got hours of video of her . I 'm talking about your sister . - I know that 's who you 're looking for . - Yeah . You don 't know how badly I wanted her to be in one of those graves . Hard as it is to admit , I wanted to find her here riding her bike like all these other kids . I guess I just want it to be over . - [ Door Opens ] - [ Man ] Agent Mulder , Scully . There 's a Mr. Harold Piller here to see you . - Mr. Piller ? - Agent Mulder . - Agent Scully . - Do we know each other ? Not personally , no . But I 'm happy to meet you . Hi . Harold Piller . Mr. Piller , are you part of this investigation ? Yes , I hope to be . - How can we help you ? - I was hoping to help you . You 're a police psychic . My references are on the back . I 've gotten some strong hits off this case . You 're looking for a little girl , but she 's not among the dead . Your suspect is going to say he didn 't kill her . Did he ? No . I think I can help find her . Mr. Piller , you have some interesting references here . You 've worked with law enforcements in Kashmir , India , Myanmar , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Khyber Pass . That was a train wreck ... a horrible tragedy . They called me in to locate the bodies of seven children who were unrecovered . - And did you recover them ? - I didn 't recover them , no . - But I explained what happened . - What happened ? The children 's bodies were transported from the accident site ... by a spiritual intervention , what are known as walk-ins . Thank you , Mr. Piller , but we have real work to be done . I 've studied this phenomenon the world over ... at mud slides in Peru , earthquakes in Uzbekistan . Kids ' bodies never found , never accounted for in any other way . What happened to them ? The bodies were transported from the various sites ... in starlight . Please excuse us . Mulder ? - Mulder , please . - What is it ? Mulder , you have been through so much in such a short time ... the death of your mother and the feelings it 's brought up for your sister . You 're vulnerable right now . We still have a missing body ... Amber Lynn LaPierre . She may be alive . We don 't know . But this man isn 't gonna help us find her , by his own admission . It 's not the first time I 've heard what he 's saying ... about the intervention of these walking spirits . Kathy Lee Tencate mentioned it to me in the prison . - She said that 's who took her son . - Because it 's foolproof , Mulder . Nobody is gonna disprove it if there 's no body . And that 's exactly what this man does . He gives a comforting explanation at a train wreck ... or an earthquake that everyone can live with . But the fact is the bodies are still buried . Or maybe they are somewhere else . Like your sister ? Mulder , you told me that all you wanted was for this to be over . I do . I do . Well , then I 'm going back to Washington . There 's nothing more to be done here . How long have you been doing this ? A few years . I have a son who disappeared under strange circumstances . He 's never been found . And then one day , I just ... started to see them . These walk-ins , you say they ... they come and take the children . - Why ? - In almost every case , the parents had a precognitive image ... of their child dead . Horrible visions . I believe what this is is the work of good spirits ... foretelling their fates . A fate the child was about to meet , a particularly violent fate that wasn 't meant to be . Which is why the spirits intervened , transforming matter into pure energy . Starlight . But it 's not what happened here . How do you know that ? Because these children all died suffering , pleading innocently for their lives . These beautiful children , so ... trusting and pure . I see them . My God , why ? Why must some suffer and not others ? You see them ? Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre ? She wasn 't here . She never was . But I 'm ... I 'm sensing a connection with her ... to this place . No , it 's a connection to ... - It 's a connection to you . - How 's that ? You lost someone close to you . Ayoung girl . It happened a ... a long time ago . Your sister . There 's a connection between these girls , isn 't there ? Between her and Amber Lynn ? What is the connection ? I don 't know . But we 're going to find them . I 'm sure of it . [ Man ] I 'm going to count backwards now , Fox . And you 'll fall into a deep relaxed state ... so that you 'll remember all about your sister and what happened . One hundred , ninety-nine , ninety-eight , ninety-seven , ninety-six ... Where are you now , Fox ? I 'm at home ... my mom and dad 's . We 're in the den playing a game . Who are you there with ? Samantha . - Do you feel in any danger ? - No . We 're arguing , you know , but not really . Just playing the game . You know , fooling around . By what I can tell from the tape , he seems to be in a legitimate hypnotic state . Pieces on the board are fallin ' off ... [ Man ] Here I became suspicious . - [ Mulder ] Samantha ? - Suspicious of what ? In 30 years with the F.B.I. , you think you 've seen it all . I sometimes think I have . But this is just a garden variety compensatory abduction fantasy . Compensatory for what ? His guilt . His fear . Everything that 's preventing Agent Mulder ... from remembering the truth about what really happened that night . You mean his sister wasn 't abducted ? No , his sister definitely went missing in 1973 . That 's not in dispute . Agent Mulder , however , wasn 't regressed until 1989 . See , his delusion is playing into his unconscious hope ... that his sister is still alive . And if you think about it , his delusion has the effect ... of giving him reason to pursue her . But why alien abduction ? Close Encounters , E. T. , who knows ? But there was probably a lot of imagery collecting in his head ... in those 16 years . And then he comes down here , and he finds the X-Files . So what do you think happened to his sister ? Well , in 1973 ... we were pretty damned unsophisticated about violent predatory crime . My guess is she was kidnapped in the house , her body was disposed of , never found . You think that his sister 's dead ? Have you seen this file ? There was an extraordinary amount of effort put into fnding his sister . Even the treasury department got involved . His father worked at a high level in the government . They found nothing . Why , Agent Scully ? Why do you wanna bring all this back up now ? Someone owes it to Mulder . Word of advice , me to you . Let it be . You know , there are some wounds that are just too painful ever to be reopened . Well , this particular wound has never healed . And Mulder deserves closure , just like anyone . [ Charlton Heston On TV ] Apes evolved from men ? - There 's gotta be an answer . - Don 't look for it , Taylor . You may not like what you find . [ Knocking ] Untie me ! [ Knocking Continues ] - What ? What are you doing ? - I 'm picking up something . - It 's 3 : 00 in the morning . - There 's someone here . - Yeah , the TV is on ... - No . A visitor . They ... They wanna speak . They wanna tell us something . What ? Get a piece of paper . - [ Shuts TVOff ] - And a pen . No , you . Shoot . It 's your mother . She 's here in the room with us . She 's trying to speak to you . What does she say ? She wants to tell you about your sister ... - where she is . - [ No Audible Dialogue ] What is she saying ? Harold ? I don 't know . L ... - [ Sighs ] She 's gone . - Come on , Harold . I lost her . - That 's crap . You 're full of crap . - No . - Get out of here . - I 'm telling you ... - I 'm telling you , I never should have listened to you . - She was here ! - She had a message . - Please go . Look ! Who wrote that ? You did . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Mulder . - [ Scully ] Mulder , it 's me . I found something , and I 'm standing here not quite believing what it is . - What is it ? - I don 't know if you know this , but there was a special treasury department investigation into Samantha 's disappearance . In 1973 . I know all about that . Well , I 'm in your mother 's house and I found a piece of a document that she burned . A document that matches one that I found in the treasury investigation file . But she had the original , Mulder . I don 't see where you 're goin ' with this , Scully . This is the document that effectively calls off the search for your sister , Mulder . And it 's signed with the initials " C.G.B.S. " C.G.B. Spender ... the Smoking Man . He was involved with this back in ' 73 . That 's not exactly a revelation , Scully . He was a friend of my father 's . Mulder , you told me you believed that he 's the man that killed your father , that he 's the man who 's done nothing but confound your work , who 's come close to killing you . And here he 's ordering people to stop looking for your sister . I don 't see what you think this proves , or how you think it 's gonna help me find her now . - You don 't wanna press him ? - It 's a dead end . He 's never been of any help , and he 's not gonna be of any help now . Look , I 'm pursuing this my own way , all right . I gotta go . It 's not exactly the end of the rainbow , is it , Harold ? There 's something here . I 'm getting a strong sense of it . I think we should have a look . I 've had a look . What are you afraid of ? That you 'll really find her ? - That you 'd have to deal with it ? - There 's nothing here . - It 's a decommissioned base . - You wrote the name down yourself . Why do you care so much about what I feel ? Why is this so important to you ? [ Car Approaching ] You gentlemen need to move along . I have to ask you to turn around and get back in your car . There 's nothing to see here . There is something here to see , Agent Mulder . I 'm sure of it . [ Ringing ] - Hello ? - [ Dial Tone Humming ] - [ Groans ] - [ Cigarette-Smoking Man ] I should have grabbed it for you . I like to make myself useful . You can start by putting out that cigarette . You 've got it all figured out , don 't you , Agent Scully ? All but why you can 't just come to the door and knock . I did that . No one answered . You 're sick . I had an operation . What do you want ? I want you to stop looking . You 've wanted that since 1973 ... when you ordered an end to the search for Agent Mulder 's sister . Your initials are on that document . Yes , I signed that order , because I knew then what I know now ... no one 's gonna find her . - Why not ? - Because I believe she 's dead . No reason to believe otherwise . You 're a liar . If you knew that she was dead , why didn 't you say something earlier ? Why now ? There was so much to protect before . It 's all gone now . So you just let Mulder believe that she was alive for all these years ? Out of kindness , Agent Scully . Allow him his ignorance . It 's what gives him hope . - My sister was here ? - Yes . One of these houses ? Where ? I 've lost it , whatever it was . Which house , Harold ? Come on . Which house ? - I don 't know . - Harold , we don 't have all night . Which house was it ? Let 's go , Harold . You were right . This was the house . - How do you know ? - Look . I told you ! What did I tell you ? You told me she was here . You didn 't say with who . When did you come up with this story , Mulder ? Because yesterday when I spoke to you , you said that the Smoking Man wasn 't involved . Turns out you were right . He had every reason to call off the hunt for my sister . After her abduction , she was returned to him ... and he raised her at the military base , along with his son Jeffrey Spender . - Mulder ... - Scully , I saw her name in the cement . Her handprints right next to his . Mulder , I spoke to him ... the Smoking Man , C.G.B. Spender , whatever his name is . You went to him ? He told me that she was dead . Well , he 's a liar . Mulder , why would he lie now ? I mean , think about it . It hurts me to tell you this . The handprints prove he 's a liar ! I saw her handprints in the cement . Her name " Samantha " right underneath them . How more obvious can it be ? Harold Piller led me there . He led me right to ' em . Oh , he led you , Mulder . He led you from the moment that he met you . - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Something wrong ? Sit down , Harold . Hi . You 're back . Scully has informed me that you failed to mention something to me when we first met . - What ? - That you 're currently the subject ... of a criminal investigation into the murder of your son . My son was taken from me . The police need someone to blame . That 's not all , Harold . Your history of mental illness . - You were institutionalized , diagnosed with schizophrenia . - I 've got that under control . You wouldn 't have believed me if I had told you any of that . - Look what I 've shown you . - You only tell me what you see . I came to you because I wanna help . You think I 'm a fraud ? What do I have to gain from this ? How am I any different from you ? All I want is to find my son . L ... I just ... I just want my little boy back . I see these things . I don 't know how , but ... there has got to be a reason . And if it 's not to help , what is it ? I know your sister is out there . Maybe I can prove it to you . Whoever 's lived here hasn 't lived here in a long time . - We 're gonna need to hold hands . - What do you mean ? I 'm going to try and summon their presence into the house . Oh , yea . A seance . I haven 't done that since high school . Maybe afterwards we can play " postman " and " spin the bottle . " [ Sighs ] I 'm not going to say anything . I 'm just going to be very quiet and still . That 's how it seems to work best . Um , you might experience a sudden chill ... or feel a pressure in your ears . That means they 're here . And if they need to , they 'll let themselves be seen . Close your eyes ... and let them come to you . They will come to you if you 're ready to see . - How will we know ? - Shh . Stay quiet . You 'll know . Mulder ? - What are you doing ? - It 's here . What is ? There was a boy . He led me into this room . Mulder ? It 's a diary . It 's your sister 's . [ Mulder ] " They did more tests today , but not the horrible kind . " I was awake and they made me lay still ... " while they shine lights in my eyes . " They asked me questions , but I always lie now ... " and tell them what they wanna hear just to make ' em stop . " I hate them and I hate the way they treat me , " like I 'm an old suitcase they can just drag around and open up whenever they want to . They know I hate them , but they ... don 't even care . " This is 1979 . She 's 14 years old here . Fourteen years old . [ Turning Pages ] " Sometimes I think my memories were taken by the doctors , but not all of them . " I remember faces . I think I had a brother ... " with brown hair who used to tease me . " I hope ... someday he reads this and knows I wish I could see his face for real . " And then , uh , she 's , uh , talking about running away . She wants to run away ... so that they stop doing the tests . And then it just stops . [ Closes Diary ] Let 's get out of here . You know , I never stop to think ... that the light is billions of years old by the time we see it . From the beginning of time ... right past us into the future . Nothing is ancient in the universe . Maybe they are souls , Scully ... travel through time and starlight ... looking for homes . I wonder what my mother saw . I wonder what she was trying to tell me . Get some sleep . All right . [ No Audible Dialogue ] I got it , Mulder . I couldn 't believe it when I saw it . It was like it was looking for me . - Sergeant 's blotter , 1979 . - What are you talking about ? [ Scully ] The description matches your sister . - When did you find this ? - Mulder , it 's almost noon . [ Scully ] Maybe she went by another name . She could have given them a name other than her own . She didn 't give a name at all . Read this . It 's a medical report . Admittance notes say the E.R. Nurses couldn 't get her name out of her . Neither could the cops . Her medical examination is normal . Her mental state ... it says here she was exhibiting signs of paranoia . Evidence of probable self-inflicted abuse , including small crescent-shaped scars on her knees , wrists and chest . Those are from the tests , Scully . That 's her . She was here . Fourteen years old in this hospital . " Diagnosis of condition incomplete . Tests unavailable . " And he knew . He lied . He knew she was alive . And the only reason he 's lying now is because she 's still alive . Mulder , wait . I know . You don 't want me to get my hopes up . I understand that . That was 1979 . It was 21 years ago . I don 't know where to begin , and we don 't have a record here of a doctor signing her out . We have an E.R. Nurse who signed her in . What 's wrong ? I have this powerful feeling , and I can 't explain it , but that ... this is the end of the road . That I 've been brought here to learn the truth . Are you ready for it ? Do you want me to go talk to her myself ? Okay . Oh . I thought that was the door . - Arbutus Ray ? - Yes . Are you the same Arbutus Ray that worked as a nurse ... at the Dominic Savio Memorial Hospital in 1979 ? Yes , I 'm she . I 'd like to ask you about a patient you treated ... a 14-year-old girl . [ Arbutus ] I remember . Yes . She was such a pretty young girl . You couldn 't forget someone like her , or how frightened she was . Scared for her sweet life . The deputy brought her in . She was shaking like a leaf . Wouldn 't let anyone touch her but me . Then the strangest thing happened . You had a vision of her ... dead . Like the parents of Amber Lynn LaPierre . No one believed me . Honestly , you 're the first person who ... - So you saw her dead ? - That night in her bed . I blinked and it was gone . She was sleeping as sound as could be . I don 't know why , but ... it made some kind of strange sense . What do you mean ? There were men . They came to pick her up late that night . I assumed the one was her father , but he ... he gave me such a chill when he looked at me ... when I asked him would he please put out his cigarette . So , they took her ? They meant to . But when I took them to her room , she was gone . Disappeared out of a locked room . Just vanished . # # [ Soft , Ethereal ] # # [ Continues ] Samantha . Mulder , where 'd you go ? End of the road . He 's okay . It 's okay . My son ? You saw my son ? He 's dead . They 're all dead , Harold ... your son , Amber Lynn , my sister . - No . - Harold . You see so much , but you refuse to see him . You refuse to let him go . But you have to let him go now , Harold . He 's protected . He 's in a better place . They 're all in a better place . We both have to let go , Harold . You 're wrong . I 'm going to find him . [ Panting ] I don 't believe you ! Mulder , what happened ? Are you sure you 're all right ? I 'm fine . I 'm free . [ Child ] I made this !

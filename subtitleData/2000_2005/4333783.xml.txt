 Okay , so what 's the better look for a summit meeting between a bunch of mutants and warlords ? The " I 'm serious about peace but I still like to party , " or the " I 'm open-minded but no one with flippers need apply " ? With this crowd , I 'd try the " I have a defense gauntlet and I know how to use it . " Well , don 't forget you 're going to the conference to ensure Marla 's safety not to " party-hearty " as Cleo puts it . Don 't worry , Voice . Mauser , isolate Marla . Isolating , locked on . That 's her ? She 's kind of butch . I knew Marla when she and her goons were running bootleg mash and stolen gauntlets from Downshaft . Now she 's a big peacemaker ? Please . We all know who Marla used to be . Give her some credit for changing . She was the only underlord who had enough clout to get everybody to the bargaining table . If her alliance is successful , two dozen levels will have law and order . We 'll see . She hasn 't pulled it off yet . No , she hasn 't , Hel , and I would like your team there to see she does . Yep . We 're on our way , Voice . I 'll have to meet you there . I 've got to swing by the Traxan Level and pick up my sister . I can 't wait to see her . Is bringing Lily a good idea ? Yeah , she 'll be fine . Anyway , I feel bad I haven 't spent much time with her since she came underground . Oops . See you at the conference . Yeah . Yeah . May I ? No , uh ... Yeah . I mean , I don 't think anyone 's standing there . I 've been watching you . Really ? Why would anyone do that ? Flowers like you don 't grow underground . Am I right ? Well , actually , I 've lived on the surface my whole life . I 've only been underground for a couple of months . It shows . I came down to be with my sister , Rose . Really ? Rose ? She 'll be here in a minute . You can meet her if you - What are you doing ? Let me go . This is gonna sting a little . No . No ! No , no . What are you lookin ' at ? Let 's go ! Lily , are you hurt ? Oh , Rose . What happened ? What were you doing with those guys ? I don 't know . They-they put something in me . What ? Just a small swarm of nano-plasmic parasites . Slade , you lowlife . What did you do to my sister ? I had her injected with a colony ... of those self-replicating critters . They 're coursing through her bloodstream right now , breeding . In three hours , they 'll activate , consuming every cell in her body . She 'll just collapse , an empty bag of skin . Still the same old Sarge . What do you want ? Kill Marla , or your sister 's already dead . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . " In the year 2525 " " There are women with the will to survive " " Fighting for a brand new day " " Nothing is gonna get in their way " " And in the year 2525 " " Three women keep hope alive " " Joining forces to reclaim the Earth " " Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth " CLEOPATRA 2525 2x01 " THE WATCH " Subtitles SubXpacio Kill Marla and I 'll give you this . Inject it into your sister before the three hours are up , and they will consume all those nasty little buggers . She 'll be as clean as a whistle . How do I know you 'll keep your end of the bargain ? Sarge , is there no honor among thieves ? I keep my word . So do I. When this is over , I 'm coming after you , Slade . Just kill Marla . You used to enjoy messy jobs like this . I knew I should have kept you in the lab . It 's too dangerous down here on your own . Too many men like Slade . Who is he ? When I first came underground , I ran with a group called the Black Watch . Slade was their leader . I was close with him for a while and then I realized the man he really was , so I left . The Watch doesn 't like it when you leave . What are we gonna do ? I 'm gonna pray that there is honor among thieves . I 'm gonna kill Marla . Over there . Marla . Hel . Last time I saw you , you were peddling home brew synth-shine on Level 105 . Yeah . And I 'd still be doing it , and worse , if you hadn 't taken a hand in things . What happened ? Oh , this is Cleopatra . She 's , um , assisting in security today . I - I really admire what you 've done , bringing all of these levels together . Your friend Hel here , she convinced me that there was more to life underground than squeezing a profit out of everyone else 's misery and weakness . Yeah , she can be pretty persuasive . You should come by my suite later . I still have a few bottles of that synth-shine left . All right , party . Halt . He 's clear . Move along . Next . You 're clear , next . Stop right there ! I 'm security . You 're confirmed . Sorry about that . There she is . Oh , no . You don 't have to kill someone to save me . Listen to me . As soon as one delegate can screw the others over , this coalition is gonna fall apart . If the choice is between losing you and taking down Marla , there 's no choice , understand ? Don 't say anything to Hel or Cleo . Oh , look at you . All " Miss hip underground-dweller " now . How have you been ? I 've been well . Nice to see you , too , Cleopatra . Sarge , now that you 're here to relieve me , I 'm gonna borrow your little sis for a while . There 's this delegate from Level 97 that you have got to meet . Where 've you been ? Oh , sorry , we got hung up . Everything under control here ? Oh , yeah . Good . Where 's Marla ? Hmm , she must have gone back to her quarters . Uh , don 't you think one of us should be with her ? Good call . Yeah , let 's go . No , that 's okay . I can do it , um , if you don 't mind keeping an eye on Lily . I don 't think I like the idea of Cleo taking her on a manhunt . Yeah , all right . Gentlemen ... Well , I 'm a real thrill-seeker myself . Nothing like a good 50 or 60-level plunge down the shaft in the morning to get the blood pumping . Isn 't that right , Lily ? Lily . Oh , hold on for a second . Lily ? Lily ! Oh , honey , what 's wrong ? It 's Rose . Well , what about her ? It 's okay . You can tell me . She 's gonna kill that woman . Which woman ? Marla . Hel . Hel ! Call me . Go ahead , assassin . Hel , get out of my way . Sarge , listen to me . Lily told us everything . I 'm sorry , Rose . I couldn 't let you kill someone to save me . Lily , Marla used to buy and sell people like you . I wouldn 't lose any sleep over trading her life for yours . Now , stand aside ! Marla has changed and I thought you had , too . A situation like this , your back against the wall , you put your faith in the team . There 's nothing you can do . Lily told us about Slade and-and the parasite that they put in her . Maybe Mauser can come up with an antidote . I scanned the parasite . It 's constantly mutating . There 's no way we can come up with a counter-agent in time . This is the only way . There is another way . You 're on my stool . Hey , watch it ! Mash . What are you lookin ' at ? I don 't know yet . You with the Watch ? Fine , don 't tell me if you don 't want to . So where were we ? You were telling me about the time you took out those gardens from the lower levels . So are you ? Maybe . Which shaft do you control ? 31 . That one is so big . What 's your name ? Drake . Oh , Drake . Do you have a girlfriend ? I did till you showed up . Hey ! So , Drake of the Black Watch , do you think that I 'm tough enough to see Black Watch central ? Mmm . You sure you wanna go there ? It 's not very private . It 's crawling with the Watch . Oh . Well , then that 's exactly where I wanna go . I have this fantasy ... Cleo 's on the move . That was quick . She 's doing what she does best . She 's so heroic . Hang on . This is Black Watch headquarters . You sure you 're ready for this ? Oh , yeah , definitely . See that ? We 're monitoring the conference . I 'll be damned . Looks like they 're back at the old HQ . Hello , Drake . Please introduce me to your delectable little pet . Slade , this is Madonna . Hello , Madonna . Charmed . And what is Madonna doing here ? She 's come to entertain the troops . Try me out and maybe I can become a regular . She 's very beautiful . Yes , she is . Oh . Much more beautiful than those pathetic leeches that come into that lowlife bar to be picked up by one of the Watch . Uh , oh , yeah . Yeah , way better than anything I 've ever seen down there . And did this not at all make you suspicious , Drake ? Suspicious ? Oh , man ! I hope that was some kind of secret handshake . Uh , that 's my lighter . Looking for this ? Uh , it 's pretty . Hmm . No , no , no , no ! No . Where is Sarge ? I have a hunch she might be looking for this . Uh-oh ! Oh , oh . Come back here ! Where 's the antidote ? Oh , okay , hold on ! I got it ! I got it ! I got it ! Uh , I don 't got it . Hurry ! Hold on ! Oh , there it is . Oh , no . I got it ! I got it ! Uh-uh-uh , you move , she dies . You knew what you had to do , Sarge . You lose . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Lily . See you , Sarge . Hey ! Lily ! Hang in there , Lily . Sarge ! Hold on , it 's gonna be okay . Oh , oh . It 's working . You tried to have me killed , Slade . In the old days , I would have returned the favor , but times have changed . I promised to keep law and order on these levels , and I meant it . Take him away . I made a promise , too , Slade , remember ? I said I was comin to get you . But like Marla says , times have changed . So have some of us . Now you can take him away . Come on . Don 't worry , we 'll see that he gets a speedy trial . I think that before we turn you loose down here again , you need to learn how to take care of yourself . I can help you out . When I first started down here , I was pretty clueless , too , but now I 've got this world wired ! Thanks , Cleo . But , actually , I was thinking maybe you could spend some time with my old combat master . What do you think ? Learn to fight ? Yep . Yeah . That 's my girl . Well done , Hel . There were a few snags but you helped give this new alliance a fighting chance . Oh , thank you , Voice . Beverage , ma 'am ? Oh , thank you . Be careful . Those have quite a kick . Oh , don 't worry , Voice . I mean , I ... Do you have us under surveillance ? You could say that . I hate to miss an opportunity to get dressed up and go out . Happens so rarely . Oh , and do try the vegetarian pâté . It 's marvelous . Voice ? Hel , are you ready to go ? I think I 'll mingle for a while . Hmm , okay . Don 't wait up . Wouldn 't dream of it . Remember , Hel , no glove , no love . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

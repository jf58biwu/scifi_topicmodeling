 Hiya . Arthur , it 's Harry . I 've been trying to get ahold of you for three days . - What 's the matter ? - I gotta see you . Now . Please . - One hour . - Arthur , I 've got big trouble . It just doesn 't make any sense , Arthur . They said I broke the agreement . Day before yesterday , they stopped answering my calls . What can I do ? Give ' em a call . Say a few words on my behalf . I wouldn 't know who . Why should they listen to me ? I 'm no part of that . No , but your father was . A very important part . His brains helped put the whole thing together for ' em . They still talk about him like he was a patron saint . You 've got his name . Please , Arthur ? It 's all I 've got . Thanks . Save it . Come on outside . Let 's have a drink . You know , I 've given a good many years . Me and your father both . How many friends you think I got right now , huh ? What ? I was just thinkin ' . Remember that fishing ' trip ... that you and me and your father took up to Canada ? You was about eight , right ? Seven or eight . You fell overboard . You couldn 't swim . Your old man says , " He 'll learn pretty fast . " You were flopping ' around . You looked like a drowned rat . But you didn 't say a word . You didn 't yell for help or nothin ' . You just kept lookin at your old man ... and he didn 't make a move . Well , pretty soon I had to reach out ... and grab you by the hair and pull you in the boat . You looked like a drowned rat . Your old man , he laughed like hell . That was a long time ago . Hey , what are you drinkin ' ? We 've got vodka ... we got scotch , bourbon . Arthur , this is my son Steve . Steve , this is Mr. Bishop . Hi . How are you ? I need some bread , Dad . What are you talkin ' about ? Why , just this morning I was- - I only need a thousand . Besides , my asking you for money ... makes you feel I 'm dependent on you . Kinda ties us together . Fast , huh ? Chromosomes will tell . He 's got a point . My father gets uptight when I ask him for money ... he steals from other people . Steve , that 's enough . Don 't get excited . It 's bad for you . Nice to meet you . Drop by any time , huh ? Any friend of Big Harry 's ... I know you gotta go . I 'm sorry about that . Forget it . I just don 't understand him anymore . It 's just so ... Well , call me when you know something , OK ? OK . Take care of yourself . Arthur Bishop ? I have a special delivery . Certified . Please sign here . Mr. Bishop ? We would like you to go ahead ... anytime . - Nothin ' else , huh ? - Nothin ' else . You 're to wait down there ... and I wait for you at the top of the hill . Well , could you tell anything by his voice ? I mean the tone ? Harry , stay loose . Yeah , sure . It 's like you say , if they 're willin ' to talk , well ... Harry , I 'll be parked right up there . Say , don 't you think that ... Hello ? ! Well , I 'm here ! Come on , let 's talk . You said we were gonna talk ! Harry , run to the car . - It 's a set-up . - I can 't ! I 'll try to get behind him . Run ! Oh , God . I can 't- - Keep going ! I can 't . You ? This is it , huh ? Finish it , Arthur . You or me . Finish it . I had a feeling . Can I come in ? Oh , my darling , it 's been so long . I said I wasn 't gonna do this . I had it all worked out . I go to the door , there you are . I smile , very poised , as if I just saw you yesterday . I 'm sorry . Nothing 's changed . It never does . OK , I think I 've got it together . You know ... I think you 've lost some weight . I wrote you a letter . I couldn 't mail it . I didn 't know where . I keep movin ' around . It 's true , you know . I do always know when you 're near . ESP . Maybe . What 's the matter , baby ? Well , I 've been here about three minutes ... and you 've managed about one recrimination a minute . I can 't seem to feel anything but hurt when you 're not here . I guess when I see you again , I just have to hurt back . Did you really write me a letter ? " My dearest love ... " I 'm once again alone . " I can 't hear you . " And the silence in this room ... " presses against my ears until I 'm deafened . " This is the way I live until I see you again ... " and then you 're here and there 's no past . " Only the two of us . " I know these words hurt you ... " because you can 't give anything but the moment ... " but I have to write them now ... " because somehow my need for you must find its voice . " And you--what of your pain ? " If you could only let me have ... " one small part of the weight of it . " Don 't read anymore . Don 't you see ? Even that would be a comfort to me when you 're not here . Oh , my darling , I love you so much . I can 't- - Don 't . It 's gonna be all right . Oh , baby , I love you . Oh , my darling . Darling , take us to bed . Baby , I missed you . I 'm so glad you 're here . I love you . It 'll be a hundred more this time . The letter took me a while to make up . All right ? Yes . The letter was good . Try to think of something like it for next time . OK , I will . To his community and church ... he gave his resources , his faith , and his spirit . His good works comfort us in the going . We commit his remains to your earth , O , Father ... and we pray you vouchsafe him eternal life . I 've always been interested in primitive rituals ... like tucking the dead away . Glory be to the Father and to the Son ... and to the Holy Spirit . Glory be to the father , Harry McKenna ... fixer extraordinaire ... pusher , pimp , thief , arsonist . You liked him a lot ? Oh , yeah . He was my kind of man . What was your connection with him ? He worked for my father a long time back . He thought I could do him a favor . So , your old man was in , huh ? And you ? Don 't you think you should be ... Yeah , you got somethin ' goin ' . You 're pretty sure of yourself . I live in my mind , Mr. Bishop . Sounds like something I read someplace . And so do you . Could I have a ride home ? Sure . Amen . Come on . Steve 's got the whole place outside . Good old Steve ! What are they celebrating ? Well , this is all mine now . My father never really liked my friends ... and I 'm not so sure I do , either . Hey , we 've got a call here from Katmandu . Hey , Katmandu 's calling , Sam . Yes , I placed a call to Sydney , Australia . We got the White House . Yes , I want to speak- - Yeah . No , listen , I live there . I know he 's there . It 's all in the bubbles . Yeah , emergency . I must speak to him . John Lenn- - Hey , Steve , Louise is on the phone . Sounds important , man . - Afghanistan here . - No , I didn 't call Afghanistan . - Hello , Louise ? - Are you with her ? - You don 't love me . - That kinda talk is foolish . I 'm gonna kill myself . I wanna die . - Louise , please . - I do . - Well , go ahead then . - I will . You don 't care . Yeah , that 's right . I don 't care . Right- - My friends are so happy , they 're killing themselves . Would you come along ? Who 's he ? He 's a friend of the family 's . I thought you 'd already started . Oh , no . I wanted you to watch . Now , let me see if I 've got everything . Ice cubes , wine , razor blades . How long does it take ? I don 't know . Sure you do . You know everything . Louise , you called me because ... either you don 't want to do it , and you want me to stop you ... or you want to lay the guilt of it on me ... and I 'm not buying either one . So go ahead on . Hold on . Mind if I have a little wine first ? You son of a bitch . Mr. Bishop ? Not for me , thanks . You really don 't believe . Baby . I call you baby because your innocence touches me so . Those really are sharp , aren 't they ? I always said that you had guts , Louise . About how long will it take ? Mr. Bishop ? How much do you weigh ? 110 . Two and a half to three hours . At first you 'll get cold , and then sleepy . You 're a son of a bitch , too . Louise , I haven 't had anything to eat yet today . What you got in the fridge ? Thanks . I know he 'll stop me . I know he will . I know he feels something . I know you . What ? I didn 't hear you , baby . What 'd you say ? I said you 'll stop it . Listen . If you don 't care anything ... about your own life , then why should I ? You do care . You do . And you do , too . I 'm cold . I 'm getting colder . I 'm cold . Psychosomatic . You 've got an hour and a half left . Please , Steve . I don 't want to do it . If you kick it ... you can probably make the sheriff 's station ... in Malibu in about fifteen minutes . Would you have let it happen ? Would you ? Look , I was just an observer . You haven 't answered my question . Well , what do you think ? We 'll never know , will we ? Well , say that I just sat there ... or we just sat there and watched her check out . Think that would have been crazy ? Irrational , maybe . Is there anything wrong with that ? It just means that you have your own rule book . I can dig that . Is that so ? It takes a very special kind of person ... to pick up the tab for that kind of living . You say you dig it , but you 're talkin ' about ... something you really know nothing about . And you do ? Do I ? Very slippery . When he 's cornered , he answers questions with questions . What 's your action , Mr. Bishop ? You 've been watching too many late movies . Well , it 's been interesting . Thanks . Maybe another time . The underwater feeding show ... by Marineland 's staff diver in the giant fish tank . The giant fish tank is to your left ... Next of kin ? None . Anybody we can notify ? How about an acquaintance ? Are you finished , doctor ? No , there 's a charge . You can take care of it at the cashier 's window one floor up . I suggest that you make an appointment with your doctor . That is , if you have a doctor . What do you think ? What 'd you feel before you passed out ? Couldn 't get my breath . Palms sweating ? Nausea ? Heart beating fast ? Sounds like an A.R. Acute anxiety reaction . Classic neurasthenic pattern . See a doctor , Mr. Bishop . Have some tests . If they come back negative ... maybe you should think about seeing a psychiatrist . In the meantime , take these . They 'll help a little . I need a signature , Doc . Hey , you were really out there for a while . The cashier , you say , is on the first floor ? Dr. Richmond wanted in Emergency . Watch your backs , please . Thank you . You waiting ' for me ? How long you been here ? Since last night , about 12 : 00 . Must be important . You said another time . I said maybe another time . That 's right . That 's what you said . Come on in . So this is what it looks like inside your head , huh ? This place must 've cost some bread . Are you still trying to figure my action ? I inherited enough . It is nice to be comfortable , isn 't it ? Is there something specific you want to talk about ? No , I just ... Well , yeah , there is . What happened the other night , that was pretty far out ... and you were saying some things about it . So ? So , how ' bout some answers ? To what ? For openers , suppose I say I think ... I 'm the kind of person ... that can pick up the tab for what happened ? What 's the rest of it ? What makes you think I can answer that ? You said that- - I said that you didn 't know anything about it . It doesn 't mean I do . Now you see him , now you don 't . Is my time up ? There is something I have to do . Can I come ? What do you want from me ? That 's incredible . Yeah . It keeps me sharp . Balance , problems of orientation- - sometimes you have to think in reverse . Here , you take it . That 's not bad . How long you been flying ? About twenty seconds . My father was what they called a judge . He would settle arguments on the council ... and his word was final . It was never questioned ... until one day some hothead from Chicago ... took exception to one of his decisions ... and put a contract on him . The guy that got him was a shooter from Topeka . That was all . How old were you then ? Your age . Maybe younger . I was still in school . You find this interesting , don 't you ? Are you kidding ? My father used to do front numbers even for me . Like if he did that , maybe it wouldn 't rub off . Never talk about that stuff . He was beautiful . Only trouble was , I really wanted to dig it . He wanted me to be a part of his front , too . So , what happened after they burned your old man ? I finished school . And ? That 's all . Then I grew up . Did your father ever tell you anything about the operation ... like how it worked ? What 's with those guys , anyway ? They all act like they 're ashamed . My father wasn 't ashamed . He was the best . Game . You 're pretty good . - Play to win , do you ? - You know any other way ? Let 's make it two out of three . OK , but I 'm telling you , I 'm genius at this game . Yeah ? You go get the ball , genius . What 's going on ? That old man is Yamoto . He 's here from Japan , where he 's a master . The other guy is Kori . Very dangerous and very fast ... but he 's got some new tricks ... that are sort of an insult to the old style . Yamoto thinks these tricks ... are useless against a classic fighter ... and he 's here to prove his point . The object of these fights is total concentration and control . They don 't actually hit each other ... otherwise one or the other would be dead ... and that 's against the law . I thought he wasn 't supposed to hit him . Probably one of Kori 's new tricks . You haven 't said three words since the match . He practically murdered that guy . Murder is only killing without a license ... and everybody kills . Governments , the military , the police . Do you think that Yamoto 's a killer ? He 's a killer who doesn 't kill . It 's funny . For him , the rules are important . That 's your expert opinion ? That 's my opinion . OK . Don 't get uptight . - Not me . - Bullshit . Look , every time we 're on this subject , the same thing happens . As long as we 're rapping it out on your terms ... everything 's OK , but the minute I have a question ... or I want to know something specific from you ... you either shine me on or go out for coffee . What the hell is going on ? You 're pressing pretty hard . You 'd better be damn sure you want to know . This is not freshman philosophy time . I 'm sure . You ever hear the term " mechanic " ... used outside of its normal meaning ? Where ? My father used it . It 's a dealer . A guy who works game tables . Anything else ? Sure . It 's a shooter . A hit man . So ? So there we are . And that 's your action ? Yeah , that figures . I 'm telling you this ... because there are times when I could use a backup . Wouldn 't have to spread myself so thin . And you seem to have the aptitude . You do this for money ? Money is paid , but that 's not the motive . It has to do with standing outside of it all on your own . I 'm gonna teach you all I can . After that , you can choose how you want it to go . - You in ? - Do I have an alternative ? There are alternatives to everything . You 've got a partner , Mr. Bishop . Associate . Point the gun as though it were an extension of your arm ... and keep both eyes open . All right , you ready ? Pull . That 's better . Much better . Pull . Winchester . 300 Magnum , 180 grains . Muzzle velocity . Pull ! 3,070 . Drop at 200 yards . Two minutes low . Pull ! 300 yards . Pull . f.3 inches . 300 yards , 1f0 grains . 4.8 inches . Pull . Doubles . Pull . There are killers , and there are killers . To tell you the truth ... they all have a different book of rules . To get away with it depends on the book of rules ... you have in your pocket at the time . Your own country , somebody else 's country ... or your own personal book of rules . All this--heroes . Half of them were killers . Napoleon was one , you know ? Pancho Villa , Genghis Khan . And then we have our own domestic brand ... like Billy the Kid , Jesse James , and John Dillinger . Yeah , they 're about as famous ... as our own honest-to-goodness heroes . Don 't tell me that 's gonna make us heroes . I wouldn 't tell you anything like that . All I 'm saying is that people who stand outside the law ... oftentimes end up as heroes . What 's with that ball of wax I see you squeezing ? Sometimes you have to hold the mark . It develops the strength . " In the ages between 4f and 64 ... " of the total deaths by accident ... " 10,431 were from falls . " You know , falls from high places are very clean . What 's that ? That is your first involvement . Taking the Zoo Drive turnoff . Now they 're going west . There 's one camera . Another . Two cameras covering the main gate . You couldn 't get within 100 yards ... without tripping that alarm system . The guards sleep in shifts . One of them awake all the time . What about number one ? Midnight till 4 : 00 in the morning . We need more . We 'll have to stay in closer until we find something . I want you to rent two cars , a Ford and a Volkswagen . This looks like it might be something . Turn this on . Comes across the border at 1 a.m. I can have it to you at 7 a.m. tomorrow . How ? In a Chicken Lickin ' truck right to your place . OK . You check the goods when it comes , then wake me . I 'll make the test . Better not be crap . You know where to find me . Well , they 'll have to turn off the alarm system ... to make that delivery . Where 'd you learn how to do that ? One of the tools of the trade , my friend . Allied Plating . This is Frank . Listen , I 've got a bumper that needs re-chroming . If I brought it in tomorrow , can I pick it up by Saturday ? We don 't work on Saturday down here . Monday afternoon the soonest . Monday 's all right . I 'll bring it in tonight . Since there 's no guard on the weekends ... at the Allied Plating plant ... we could put the bodies in these nitric acid tanks . Mr. Bishop ? We would like you to go ahead with this one . We go . I 'm gonna check you for iron before you go past here . - Come on , get out . - What 's the matter ? Come on . Get out of there . What the hell is this ? Chicken Lickin ' . Chicken Lickin' is licking ' chicken . Wise guy . Get the bodies in the truck ! Do you know my dog got a birthday card today ? I didn 't . Just my dog . Archibald , those kids on the hill there- - how can you live here with all that noise ? I called the police , but there 's nothing they can do . Daddy , it 's getting worse here every weekend . In forty-eight hours ... everything will be in solution . It was ... What ? Well , it could 've been so simple ... but that guy came out of nowhere . Those things happen ... but remember it the next time . Could you spare a few minutes , Mr. Bishop ? Yes . When ? Now . I 'm at home . All right . I have to do something for a while . I 'll see you later . Mr. Bishop is here , sir . Show him through . This way , sir . That was very untidy , Mr. Bishop . We 'd like to know how Harry McKenna 's son figures . He 'll be working with me from now on . You think this is wise ? You telling me I need your permission ? Information is all I want , Mr. Bishop . We like to know things . An organization survives only because its members ... are willing to sacrifice certain personal choices ... for the good of all . A very democratic principle , Mr. Bishop . We survive because we have this rule . What you or I want is unimportant . Only the rule . Someone trained by me could be of value to you . Nobody lives forever . You take full responsibility then ? This one has to be done fast . Very fast . I 'll handle it the way I always do . There may not be time enough for that . The word is , he 's getting ready to talk to some people . The problem is considerable . I 'm not some wild Cleveland shooter . I don 't cowboy . If he talks , things could get complicated ... sloppy . That would disturb a lot of us . It 's not really open to discussion , Mr. Bishop . This business of McKenna 's son ... has upset a few of our associates . I understand it ... but these people see it only from the outside . A quick , clean job would go a long way ... in putting everything back into proper balance . Yes , I understand . I knew you would . Your man 's in Naples . We 've given you a name in Rome ... for any equipment you might need . Good . You 're still up . I called you about 9 : 00 . Yeah , well , Louise picked me up and we ... It 's good for the nerves . She has this thing she does- - Spare me the details . Look , if I 'd known you wanted to work- - You are a free agent , my friend . The only thing you have to do ... is fulfill the requirements of the Association . And that means your occasional presence ... some intelligent responses , some skill at your work ... and nothing more . You 've got that , so what 's buggin ' you ? We got one , huh ? They want him to be cowboyed . Explain . They want me to get him now ... any way I can . That doesn 't sound very cool . What are you gonna do about that ? I 'm too far along to change my habits . I 'll do what I 've always done ... in Italy . Italy ? Am I gonna go ? Why not ? Steve McKenna . Mountain View Drive . Age twenty-four . Height- - five foot , eleven inches . Weight--16f . Right-handed . Hair--blond . Distinguishing marks- - small scar on right arm . Interests--girls , freaks ... physical fitness ... fast cars ... and killing . Just like the postcards . Let 's go to work . What time ? It 's 11 : 47 . Good ? Last time I had this was ten years ago . They make it right here , you know ... But not enough to export . Casa de fiori doesn 't travel . It 's not bad . Slowly . The time you take is very important . Savor it . Even what we 're doing now . See , you must figure it carefully . Don 't rush . Know every move , turn it over and over in your mind ... until you 're sure there are no holes . But you have to be dead sure ... or dead . No second chances . I 'll try and remember that . Remember , don 't try . Dead sure ... or dead . The room 's not going to get any bigger . I think I 'll take a walk . Is that all right with you ? What now ? It looks like they 're going south . We could follow on the Coast Road . Excuse me , sir . Would you take a picture of my wife and me ? Thank you . It seems he doesn 't do the same thing the same way twice . Except spend Friday and Saturday night on that boat . A diesel leak explosion might be nice . Yeah , but how do we get close enough ? You scuba ? Yeah . Sure . Good . I 'll go down to Rome , pick up some equipment ... and be back tomorrow night . Meanwhile , you study this chart , especially this area right here . Memorize the beach area , offshore formations ... the depth , that sort of thing . You got it . You really expect this kind of action ? You begin to lose odds out in the open like this . You straight on everything ? Where does our man sleep ? Forward bunk , starboard . His friend ? - Aft , starboard . - Engine hatch ? About four feet aft of the bridge . Let 's go . It 'll be light soon . It 's a setup . Duck ! Speed boats . - How can they know ? - Give me that . Those friends of yours ? Come on , man , what the hell is going on ? They were sent by the people I work for . Explain . When I brought you in , I didn 't check with ' em . I broke a rule . That was fast of you back there . Thanks . How long till she goes ? Just about ... now . Marcello , Cergei . They 're very thorough . You drive . Hey , man , this is getting just a little bit hairy . Yeah . I 'm gonna try something . That ought to take care of ' em . One of ' em had a walkie-talkie . He was in contact with somebody . There they are . It 's a road block . Slow down . When you 're about 200 feet from them ... put it in first like you 're going to stop ... but keep it rolling . Wedge this against the gas pedal . Jump when I say so . All right , jam it on the gas pedal now . All right . Ready , jump ! I 'm empty . Same here . What do we do now ? Our friend back there has picked up a machine gun . Hey , pick it up and let 's go . You might not get back for another ten years . This really is a beautiful city . What the hell . Let 's go . Brucine . You 'll be dead in a few minutes . Listen , you 'll really appreciate this . This stuff is absolutely clear when it 's in solution . I just coated the inside of the glass with it ... and let it dry . And when the wine hit it ... it went right back into solution--no trace . Looks just like a heart attack . You said every man has his jelly spot . Yours was you just couldn 't cut it alone . Was it because of your father ? You killed him ? I thought he just died . You see ? There you are . They told you who to hit . It kept the whole idea from being what we talked about . You needed a license . Their license . I 'm gonna pick my own mark . Hit when I want . Just like you said . Standing outside . See Naples and die . " Steve , if you read this , it means I didn 't make it back . " It also means you 've broken a filament ... " controlling a thirteen-second delay trigger . " End of game . " Bang . You 're dead . "

 Crichton : Fields of green grass . Chiana : Well , mold is , uh , is green . Crichton : Crystal-blue streams . Chiana : Ruptured bile ducts ... Actually . If I had anything at all in my stomach right now , I 'd throw up . Aeryn : I 've never seen anything like it . Moya could fit in its mouth . Chiana : It 's the remains of a Budong , one of the largest creatures there is . For the last month , you 've been telling us about this fantastic place where we 're going to get fed and this is it ? A big ... rotting Budong ? You mean that thing 's edible ? Budong flesh is ... well , it 's kind of poisonous . It 's got these pustule things filled with acid mucus . Yeah , yeah , yeah , we got it . We got that one. lt ain 't edible . ( sneezes ) Aeryn : What 's the matter with you ? I don 't know . Ah ... I don 't know . I hope it 's not a cold 'cause I 'm sure not going to get any chicken soup on a Budong . Look , I don 't know what " cheeken zoop " is , okay ? But there 's plenty of other food at the mining camp . What , people live on the Budong ? Inside , yeah . Mining for nogelti crystals . How 'd you find out about this place ? Um , my brother Nerri and I stayed here for a while . We had a great time . Why did you leave , then ? The winds blew in a different direction . Really ? How much did you steal ? It was a long time ago . And they 're going to welcome the prodigal daughter home with a thanksgiving meal . Look , we 'll work it out once we 're there . If they 've got food let 's go . What is that appalling smell ? ( sniffs ) Breakfast . Dentics . You can 't eat dentics . Fried dentics . You can eat anything if it 's fried . I 'll pass . Suit yourself , Jenny Craig but I 'm hungry . Obviously not that hungry . I say we starburst out of here and try our luck somewhere else , Crichton . Aeryn , we are out of supplies . We 're going to become the Donner Party of the uncharted territories if we don 't get some food soon . Chiana : Nobody is going to starve . The colony has food . Zhaan : Chiana 's right . We must go to the mining camp . Of course I 'm right . Aeryn : No , Zhaan . You obviously didn 't hear . Chiana 's got enemies that she forgot to tell us about . Zhaan : I need food- - now . Crichton : Zhaan , what 's going on ? Zhaan ? I must have food or I 'll die . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Aeryn : Why ? Crichton , why ? Why do I have to stay aboard Moya ? Crichton : Because D 'Argo and I are allergic to whatever 's happening to Zhaan , and you aren 't . ( sneezing ) Are you feeling all right ? You up for this ? I 'm not sure what 's worse- - the hunger pains or the frelling allergies . Rygel : What the dren are we waiting for ? Me . Sha-zam . D 'Argo : That 's nice . You think this 'll catch Temmon 's eye ? Who 's Temmon ? Just an old friend . He 'll look after me . Chiana : We 'll get food , don 't worry . Well , we better or Zhaan dies . Come on , let 's go . Aeryn : Oh , that 's just great . I get to stay onboard with the blooming blue bush and you get to play with your favorite little trelk . We 'll be back in a couple of arns , tops . ( sneezes ) I hope the food tastes better than this place smells . What did you expect ? It 's a corpse . Rygel : It 's a filthy gelft sty . Do you want food ... or not ? What about your friend ? Temmon . Why didn 't you tell us about him before ? is he edible ? Crichton : Shut up , Rygel . You did , didn 't you ? You stole from this guy . How 's this going to go down ? When I tell him Nerri 's dead he 'll forget all ... all about the money . You 're going to use your dead brother to play on his sympathies ? I have a plan . D 'Argo , it 's okay . Chiana has a plan . ( alarm sounding ) Chiana : An attack . D 'Argo . Crichton . A keedva . Chiana : Temmon ? Oh , frell . Rygel : This is who 's going to help us ? Chiana : Temmon . Temmon . It 's me . Chiana . Ch-Chiana . Don 't let me suffer like this . Get B 'Sogg . Holy ... What the hezmana are you doing ? Once that stuff touches you , you 're dead anyway ! Crichton : Chiana , what 's happening here ? He smack- - ah ! Smack into a pustule . Keedva must have been after him . Keedva . What exactly is a keedva ? Vicious beast that feeds off the Budong . Chews up anything that gets in the way . B 'Sogg : You did what needed to be done , Chiana . As usual , these weaklings didn 't have the guts to put my brother out of his misery . Go home ! All of you . I 'm closing the mine till I track that keedva and kill it . But with the mines closed how are these poor folk going to earn enough nogelti for provisions ? How are you going to anything if you 're dead ? Ah . Now , get out . I 'm gone . B 'sogg : Never thought I 'd see you again . You got some nerve . Temmon used to say you liked my nerve . That wasn 't all I liked . Too bad you left so suddenly . Why are you back ? Our ship 's out of food . We 're dying of starvation . I thought you could help us out . ( D 'Argo growling ) You want food . Hand over your weapons . No . Then stay hungry . Here you are , Marshal . B 'sogg : I 'll feed your friends but not you , Chiana . You used up my charity . Go . Chiana : Get food for Zhaan . Altana . Alive and kickin ' . Come on , girl. I 'll give you a feed . So , what 's Desdi girl been up to ? A keedva got her just after you left . She lost both her arms and half her face . Chiana : True god . Altana : Too right . Tara gave it up . She bugged out . She got some kids or something now . True ? What about Jav ? Scored big and ... left . Just like I 'm about to . Hey , girl , you 've been here too long . You 've been waiting your whole life for that big score . No good . No more , girl . I 'm leaving . Because I didhit it big . You better shut it before something you won 't like flies in . Hey . You really found something ? Vein of nogelti . Near the second liver , just past the ribs . Set me up for ten lifetimes . Oh , I 'm so happy for you . Be happy for yourself , girl . I want you to have a share . You do ? Well , then I , I can get food for Zhaan . For all of us . Just one problem- - B 'sogg . That folly closed the mines . Bastard 's probably down there right now jumping my claim . Altana ... Do you think B 'sogg ... Think B 'sogg could have killed Temmon ? No more , girl . They were brothers . Well , surely we can do something if not cure it , stabilize it . I can ... mix a salve which ... which might slow down the growth of the buds . Great , you stay there and you tell me how to mix it . Zhaan . Can you tell me ? Begin with bet-tur and ly-jel . Right . Which one are they ? The two marked vials . is it supposed to do that ? Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Can you hear me ? Frelling great . Pilot : Officer Sun . Yes ? What is it , Pilot ? Pilot : The micropollens Zhaan 's producing are beginning to affect Moya . She 's experiencing a slight numbing sensation along her inner hull . All right , we 'll put the atmosphere scrubbers to maximum capacity . Pilot : Already done . Well , I don 't know what else to suggest then . Rygel : This is your grand gesture of generosity ? Fungus , mold , lichens .. . Ugh ! What 's that you 're eating ? Meat . Why didn 't I get any meat ? You want meat , you have to pay for it . So , if what I 've given you isn 't to your liking ... ( gasps ) No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . Crichton : You can ignore the little green eating machine . We appreciate what you 've done for us . D 'Argo : We need more food . D 'Argo : We need enough to last us until we get to the next system . B 'Sogg : You want more you have to earn it like everybody else ... Once I reopen the mines . What do you say we trade ? We got medical supplies , weapons ... This is not a commerce planet . You want meat , nogelti crystals buys food . Work ... gets crystals . Then , we 'll work . Rygel : Dominars do not work ! Rygel : Especially not in some rotting corpse filled with creatures . ( men shouting ) Rygel : What are those men doing ? B 'Sogg : Deemo . Do you play ? ( chuckles ) I 'm aboutto . We 're here for Zhaan maverick , not games . I 'm here for food . This is how I 'll get it . I 'll introduce you . Most kind . ( chuckles ) D 'Argo : Maybe we should have friedthis . Well , it ain 't lobster but it 'll keep Zhaan alive . Keep an eye on the children till I get back . Aeryn : Mmm ... definitely takes the edge off . Man , can it get any worse in here ? I can barely breathe . Hey , blue . Delivery . It 's not exactly Domino 's , but it got here in less than 30 minutes . John ... Okay . Here you go . Come on . Can 't . Gone too far . Need meat . No , no , y-you don 't want meat . Meat 's bad for you. lt 's got cholesterol , hormones ... ( chokes ) Animal proteins ... Stop the budding cycle . Buds evolved ... For protection . Famine immobilizes us . Predator attacks . Buds poisoned animal . When animal dies , we eat animal to recover . I 'll get you some meat . Now . ( Rygel gasps ) You cheated . Yeah . ( chuckles ) lt 's part of the game . You 're just a lousy cheater . I 'll have you know I am an excellent cheater . I 'm just not at my best right now . This outrageous hunger is affecting me . Let 's see some of these nogelti crystals you claim to have . We 'll settle up when we 're done . You know what I think ? I think you don 't have any crystals- - never did . Don 't be ridiculous . You lie about having anything of anyvalue to bet with . Rygel : I demand another game or I 'll tear your frelling eyes out . You green-assed , stinking , warty , little bastard ! I 'm gonna kill you ! ( gulps ) That won 't get you your crystals . You get me my crystals one way or another . Yeah , you look good on that couch . You always did . I missed you . You chose Temmon over me . Well , maybe I made the wrong choice . Temmon 's gone now ... anyway . You don 't seem too broken up about it . Oh , well , neither do you . Well , we all grieve in our own way . Temmon was a brother ... a partner . I 'm going to miss him . Yeah ... Me , too ... but we got to move on . The miners need to ... D 'Argo : B 'Sogg ! Go away . One of our shipmates is dying . She must have meat . You have nothing to trade for it . We 'll get you whatever you want but I want that meat now . There must be something you want . Hey ... B 'Sogg : is that what this is about , free handouts ? I told you you want meat you have to pay for it . ( growling softly ) Maybe you do have something to trade . No ! Does he make all of your decisions for you ? B 'Sogg : That 's not the Chiana I knew . No ... I make my own decisions . Run away Luxan . ( grunts ) Now , give me what I need ! You 've got mivonks , Luxan ... But I hid the meat in the mine and no one knows the mines like I do . Kill me and you 'll never find it and your shipmate dies anyway . Chiana : D 'Argo ... if he wants a night with me ... I 'll give it to him . One night ? Uh-uh . I play for keeps . A life for a life . I give you meat- - you 're mine ... ( growls softly ) till I 'm done with you . ( chuckles ) Chiana : What were you thinking , attacking B 'Sogg like that ? What , did you think he 'd just hand over the meat ? It seemed like a better idea than waiting for you to frell him into submission . Yeah , well , if that 's what it takes , then that 's what it takes . I thought this was supposed to be about saving Zhaan . There are other ways to get the crystals that we need . I will not allow you to stay here with him . - Don 't tell me what to do ! - Well , someone has to ! Chiana ! D 'Argo ... I had a brother . He 's gone . I don 't need another . I don 't want to be ... your brother . Then , what ? ( sighs ) I want to help you . Do you want to help ? My friend , Altana , she 's ... She 's found this really big vein of crystals . She 's willing to share the wealth . is it enough to help save Zhaan ? More than enough ... Except they 've closed the mine because of the keedva . What if I went down there with her ? Pilot : Calibration is complete . Did Zhaan tell you what intensity to use ? Zhaan 's out of it , Pilot . I 'm doing this on my own . Pilot : Then , how do you know it 'll help ? I don 't , but she 's a plant and she loves light . There . Okay ... ( zapping ) What are you reading , Pilot ? Zhaan now seems to be exuding spores as a reaction to the intense light . Can you do anything about it ? I 've minimized Moya 's ambient illumination as a precaution but the spore levels are still increasing . You 've only made things worse . I had to do something and you didn 't give me any suggestions . Why did you do that ? Aeryn : What ? I was trying to help , Zhaan . Zhaan : Lies . You tried to kill me . Aeryn : Don 't be stupid . Brutish Peacekeeper . ( stifling sneeze ) Zhaan : Can 't wait to see me die . Are you enjoying this ? Not in the least . ( sneezes ) Should be easy . It 's never easy . Budong . Chiana : I 'll stay half a cycle , no more . B 'Sogg : I 've given you my terms . Take them or leave them . That was the deal , Chiana . Chiana : Can 't we negotiate ? No . Frell . Crichton : Where 's D 'Argo ? Did he get some meat ? Yeah , he 's working on it in the mines . What ? In the ... ls he nuts ? ! Crichton : You remember the creature , don 't you ? How long has he been gone ? I don 't know- - like , three arns or so . He 's with Altana . It should be easy . It 's never easy . I 'm gonna go get him . Pilot : Zhaan 's spores are spreading faster than the scrubbers can remove it . It 's penetrating Moya 's neural conduits and dulling her senses . How badly ? Already enough to impede navigation . Can you compensate ? I 'm having difficulty . My own connection to Moya is still much less than optimal . How much damage can these spores do ? If the levels continue to increase Moya could be permanently blinded . It 's all right. I won 't let that happen , Pilot . What if Zhaan were to leave Moya entirely ? If she and I were to leave in a transport pod then you could open the rest of Moya to space and flush the pollen out . That would ... help Moya .. . but what about you ? The spores have begun to affect you as well . No , I 'll be fine . We just need to buy some time until Crichton can return with some meat . You prime a transport pod , all right ? Pilot : Very well . ( coughing ) Zhaan 's gone , Pilot . D 'Argo ? ( grunting ) ( rhythmic clanking ) Slug monkey . Rygel , what the hell are you doing down here ? Get lost , Crichton . This one 's mine . Crichton : You seen D 'Argo ? Forget D 'Argo . That filthy character Vija threw me down here just because I lost at deemo . He cheated . What ? And you didn 't ? Of course I cheated . You cheated and you lost . D 'Argo and Chiana have a line on some crystals so let 's go . Crichton , I 've got a crystal right here . Our luck is changing . Rygel ... ( groans ) That 's your ear , right ? Okay , Zhaan is almost out of time so get your crystal and ... LET 'S GO ! Ow ! ( high-pitched whine ) ( growling ) ( squish ) ( whispering ) : Rygel ? ( growling ) Rygel ? ( thud ) Rygel ? ( snorting ) ( growling ) ( roaring ) Sparky ! Sorry , Crichton . Oh , no , you don 't . You 're not ditching me . Get off ! Let go ! - No way ! - There 's no reason for both of us to die . I 'm a dominar . You are just you . Shut your yap and give it more gas . There is no more gas . Let go or we 'll both die . Screw you . We 're going down ! Rygel ! Let go or we 'll die ! For the last time NO ! Let go or I 'll bite your fingers off . Oh , yeah ? Screw you . ( yells ) Rygel ! ( high-pitched whine ) Rygel ... Rygel ... Rygel , let go ! Let me go ! Lucky for you . Ow ! What was that for ? I ain 't your lunch . The dentics tasted better . ( spitting ) You tasted worse . ( spitting ) Okay , here 's the plan . You 're going to go back to the transport pod and stay there . What about Vija ? What about keedva ? Oh , good plan . Now put our asses down . Aeryn : Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Why won 't you answer me ? Pilot , why can 't you locate her ? Pilot : The spores have clouded Moya 's senses too much . I can 't even track where you are . I 'm on tier seven , and there 's no sign of Zhaan . Officer Sun , Moya 's worsening . If we don 't find Zhaan soon we may have to flush the atmosphere anyway . Understood . ( cart wheels creaking ) ( grunts ) Some water ? Thanks . Couldn 't have done this without you . Both our purposes are served : we save Zhaan , and you get out of here . I 'm not going to miss the stench but I 'll miss the thrill of it . D 'Argo : Thrill ? Always living constantly on your guard- - alive and fighting . You sound like Chiana . Ah , that girl , she 's a wild one . ( grunting ) : But she 's got a heart of good . Her loyalties are certainly flexible , that 's for sure . She 'll do whatever it takes to get meat for your friend . That 's what worries me . Nah . We always came out on top , the two of us . We had our fun even when she and Temmon were together . Ah , that fella , he was good for her and her brother . And yet , she repays his kindness by stealing from him . That 's why it 's very difficult to trust her . D 'Argo ... Are you and Chiana together ? No . No , or not yet ? That 's up to her . Pilot : Aeryn , any further deterioration and Moya will lose all ability to navigate . Then we can 't wait any longer . But unless Zhaan 's secured herself in a transport pod decompression will kill her . is there no other way to save Moya ? No ... Then seal off command and do it . Decompression in five microts . Oh , Zhaan ... forgive us . Officer Sun . Spore levels have dropped . Thank you , Pilot . Beginning repressurization now . It 'll take over an arn . Altana : D 'Argo ! ( yells ) ( roaring ) ( screaming ) ( high-pitched whine ) ( roaring ) Chiana : Crichton ! Crichton : D 'Argo make it back ? Well , didn 't you find him ? No , I found Rygel and one very big , ugly critter . They should be back by now with the crystals . It 's been a hell of a day . If we don 't get some meat before the end of it I 'm going to cut my own damn arm off and feed it to Zhaan . ( alarm blaring ) Creature alarm . Altana . What happened ? The mines were closed , but some of you decided to ignore that . Where 's D 'Argo and Altana ? I found your friends but got there too late . What the hell do you mean , " too late " ? I heard the keedva and drove it off . D 'Argo : John ... John ... D 'Argo ! ( D 'Argo gags and coughs ) Whoa , whoa , whoa , easy . I ... I tried to get it ... But I couldn 't ... I couldn 't protect her . ( coughing ) Altana . Altana ? D 'Argo , what happened ? The creature attacked . I tried to stop it , but ... How bad you hurt ? Nothing broken . Blood 's running clear . I 'll survive . Your friend 's lucky to be alive . How could this happen ? First Temmon , now Altana . You know what , boudreau ? For someone who 's supposed to be such a great critter hunter you ain 't doing that good of a job . I closed the mines for a reason . Now stay out and let me do what I have to do . Crichton : All right , pip ... What 's the plan now ? He killed Altana . He 's going to go steal her crystals . I 'm not going to let him . You stay here with D 'Argo . Boudreau is mine . ( sneezing ) ( coughing ) How much longer , Pilot ? Repressurization will be complete in 900 microts . ( sneezing ) Zhaan ... You don 't understand . Tried to kill me . Suffocate me . Poison salve . Burn me with light . Look , I 've only been trying to help you . No , always hated me . Came to Delvia . lmprisoned me . Zhaan , they were Peacekeepers . I 'm no longer a Peacekeeper . Always a Peacekeeper . Barbaric savage ! Afraid to come near me . Afraid of contamination . It 's not true . Plotting with Pilot against me . Plotting my death . Nobody wanted you dead . We did whatever we could to help you but we ran out of options . Your spores are harming Moya . Would never harm Moya . Zhaan ... look at me . I can barely talk , I can barely breathe properly . Your spores are doing that and it 's far worse for Moya . Moya .. . No ... Lies to confuse me . No , I 'm trying to get through to you and for the sake of your goddess , think . Think ... can 't think . Hazy ... Hello ? Cut through the haze , Zhaan . Think . You 're a Delvian Tenth Level Pa 'u . You trained your mind to control your thoughts . Do it now . ( weak gasp ) Can 't ... Help me . All right . I will . ( sniffing ) - Pilot . - Yes ? Get the transport pod primed . ( sniffing ) ( door clangs open ) ( sniffs ) ( purrs ) Nice stash you got here . And you came down to steal some of it . No , fella , you have to earn it . Like Altana was doing before the critter got her . ( distant roaring ) Speak of the devil . What do you say we take this conversation someplace else ? No . ( shrill whistle ) Well , I 've heard that somewhere before . ( growling ) Not yet . And I 've seen this guy somewhere before . Friend of yours ? It 's a primitive animal but intelligent in its own way . Over the years , we have developed a mutually beneficial relationship . Well , I 'm really not interested in your personal life . I should warn you I don 't taste too good . He won 't eat you . He prefers what I give him . That 's how I trained him- - to have his way . ( growling ) Chiana : Crichton ! Crichton ! B 'Sogg : I 'll let you two get to know each other . Easy , fella . Just ... You 're just a big ol ' dog , right ? Yeah . Look what I got . This is for you . Oh , yeah , this is good , huh ? You want this , yeah . Hey , yah ! There you go , have a look . No , no , it 's that way . That way , that way , there you go . Good boy , good boy . No more Captain Kirk chit-chat . ( howling ) Whoa ! ( roaring ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( roaring ) ( snarling ) ( shrieking ) Okay ... One ... two ... Come on . ( howling ) ( gasps and gurgles ) B 'Sogg . Turn around . Drop it . Drop it ! Kick it away ! Where 's Crichton ? I have no idea . Don 't frell with me . Believe me . Oh , believe you . Well , that 's a joke . Get ' em up ! Chiana ... You 're a thief and a trelk but you 're not a killer . I 'm evolving as a ... as an individual . I know you . You won 't shoot me in cold blood . You can 't do it . You 're right . I can 't . ( shouting ) ( screaming ) ( sizzling ) ( howling ) You bitch ! What did you do ? ( wailing ) Don 't leave me here to suffer ! ( loud smacking ) - Mmm ? - What ? - Mmm . - That was your fourth plate . More . Mmm-mmm . - D 'Argo ? - Thank you . Another helping ? Uh ... no . Mmm , that 's wonderful . Yeah . Carolina-style keedva . Best barbecue this side of a Budong . - Thank you , John , for everything . - A pleasure . Y 'all dig in now . Pilot is very relieved that you 're recovering . Well , as much as I suffered your experience was ... was also painful. I only made it more difficult for you . You weren 't yourself , Zhaan . No , I was the mindless savage I accused you of being . But , uh , it wasn 't very pleasant reverting back to such a primitive ... vicious state . I 'm sorry for what I said . Here . Eat . Don 't talk . You must be happy to be out of there . You can 't understand , D 'Argo . Understand what ? Loss ? I understand that . It 's not a big thing . Chiana ... You don 't have to put on an act for me . D 'Argo , I do what I do to survive . Can 't you just let it go ? I can only let go when I feel safe . You are safe . Am I ? Whoa .

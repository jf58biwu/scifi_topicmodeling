 Yeah . That went well . Malcolm Reynolds . You old son of a- - Come here ! Hey , Monty ! How you doing ? They didn 't tell me you were picking up this leg of the run . Yeah , work 's been slow lately , so I thought I 'd do some honest smuggling between jobs . - Where 's that sorry-ass ship of yours ? - Monty . Two boats like ours , meeting on an empty rock like this . That screams contraband to the feds . Or have you forgotten that time you got pinched on Beylix ? Always thinkin ' , ain 't ya ? Smarts , that 's what you got . - Smarts . - Now , okay , wait . Something 's different . - Something is- - Something is , uh- - - Yep . - The beard ! You shaved off your soup-catcher . - Yep . - I thought you were gonna wear that ugly chin-wig to the grave . - Yeah , so did I ... but she didn 't much like my whiskers . - She ? - Oh . Bridget ! What the hell am I thinking ? I gotta introduce you to the missus . Monty ! You have fallen from our noble bachelor ranks ? I wasn 't lookin ' to , but she just sort of swept me off my feet . Bridget ! - Well , she must be a rare specimen indeed . - Don 't begin to cover it . Mal , I want you to meet my Bridget . So , you guys have met ? ~ Take my love , take my land ~ ~ Take me where I cannot stand ~ ~ I don 't care , I 'm still free ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Take me out to the black ~ ~ Tell them I ain 't comin 'back ~ ~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ There 's no place I can be ~ ~ Since I 've found serenity ~ ~ But you can 't take the sky from me ~ Mal , why you got a piece trained on my wife ? - She ain 't your wife , Monty . - Huh ? - I married her , didn 't I ? - You ain 't the only one . Bridget ! Mal . Gorrammit , that 's enough ! What the hell is going on here ? What do you mean , she ain 't my wife ? - She ain 't your wife ' cause she 's married to me ! - Don 't listen to him . It 's true . About a half a year back at the Triumph settlement . Only it wasn 't Bridget then . It was Saffron . She hitched me by surprise , got on my ship and then tried to steal it out from under me ! She is cold as ice and dead crazy on top of it ! You 're a liar , Malcolm Reynolds . Now , I ain 't never got to telling ' you his name . Hell . Fine , be like that . Damn you , Bridget . Damn you to Hades . You broke my heart in a million pieces . You made me love you , and then you- - I shaved off my beard for you , devil woman . You 're gonna want to pull your claw out of that bag nice and slow . Relax . I 'm not going for a gun or anything . Just freshening up . You and lipstick are a dangerous combination , if I recall . Turn around . Oh , yeah , just like old times . We don 't have any old times . I just don 't want you pulling a pistol out of- - of anywhere . You missed a spot . Can 't miss a place you 've never been . Marriage is hard work , Mal . I know it . That doesn 't mean we should just give up . Sure , we 've had our spats . Maybe I made some bad decisions along the way- - Oh , you are a tweaked one , you are . But face it , hubby . I 'm really hot . Mm-hmm . Start walkin ' . - Walking ? Walking where ? - Pick a direction , just don 't turn around . Come on , Mal . This is my scrap of nowhere . You go on , find your own . You can 't just leave me here on this lifeless piece-of-crap moon . - I can . - I 'll die . Well , as a courtesy , you might start getting busy on that ... 'cause all this chatter ain 't doin ' me any kindness . Why don 't you just go ahead and shoot me then ? I don 't know . Why didn 't you shoot me ... back when I took my eyes off you for a split ? I 'm ashamed to say it , but I gave you the window . - You and Monty fought in the war together , right ? - Mm-hmm . Yeah , I smelled that . The war buddy bond is tough to crack . I knew that if I shot you I 'd lose Monty anyways . You just had a better hand of cards this time . It ain 't a hand of cards . It 's called a life . Seriously , Mal , you gotta give me a ride . Woman , you are completely off your nut . I won 't make trouble . You can stick me in one of those crates if you like . Just don 't leave me here . This was all your fault , you know . I had the perfect crime lined up . - Sure , you were gonna steal a man 's beard . - No , you- - A million-square job . The big time . I was gonna cut Monty and his crew in , but you screwed that royal . Odd , but I don 't think I 'll be losin ' any sleep over it . I 've got the layout , entrance codes . Believe me . This practically robs itself . Bye-bye , now . I 'm handing you a fortune on a gold platter , sweetheart . Don 't you even want to hear the details ? Whoa , Cap . Don 't tell me you got into a fight with Monty . Oh , really ? But I thought we loved Monty . We love Monty , don 't we ? If he had a tussle with that Sasquatch , we 'd all be in the dirt right about now ... scooping ' up the captain 's teeth- - Ain 't that so , sir ? You know what ? I don 't particular wanna talk about it . We got work to do . Let 's shut up and do it . Inara was asking for you . Wanted- - So , later with the talking then . - Hear you 're looking for me ? - I was . Care to sit ? I was hoping we could talk a little business . Would you like some tea ? Okay . - What 's your game ? - I offered you tea . Mm-hmm . After inviting me into your shuttle , of your own free will . Which makes two events without precedent . Which makes me more than a little skittish . Honestly , Mal , if we can 't be civilized and talk- - I 'm plenty civilized . You 're usin ' wiles on me . - I 'm using what ? - Your feminine wiles . Your Companion training , or some might say ... uncanny ability to make a man sweaty and / or compliant ... of which I 've had just about enough of today . - Maybe this isn 't the best time . - No , no . This is a fine time . You just talk plainly is all . I 'm not sleeping with you , Mal . Uh , no , I think I would have noticed . I think my keenly trained senses- - You 're not my lover- - neither are you my mother , my house mistress ... nor anyone who has the slightest say on how I conduct my affairs . Well enough . So ? - So let me conduct my affairs . - Who 's keeping you from conduct- - I haven 't had a client for three weeks . Backwater moons , slums ... frontier planets without so much as a temple built . - We go where the work is . - There 's all kinds of work , Mal . And ours is the kind that gets you shut down by the Alliance . I opt to stay off the radar . There are plenty of worlds where both of us could work . We used to visit them , remember ? Are you saying I 'm doing this deliberate on account of you ? - That there 's some reason I want you off the job ? - Is there ? This is one of the crazier things I 've heard today . And when I tell you about the rest of my day , you 'll appreciate- - - I 'm not accusing you of anything , Mal . - Hey , no . Let 's set a course for the planet of the lonely , rich , yet appropriately hygienic , man . - We can park there for a month . - Not all of your work is illegal , Mal . - Wanna keep me off the job now ? - The best job you ever pulled was on a central planet . How about I stay out of your whoring- - - That didn 't take long . - You keep out of my thieving . I know my job very well . Thank you very much . Right , you 're a criminal mastermind . What was the last cargo we snuck past the Alliance to transport ? - That was- - - What was the cargo ? - They were dolls . - They were little geisha dolls with big heads that wobbled . - Hey , people love those ! - And what exactly was our net profit ... on the famous wobbly headed doll caper ? Uh , " our " cut ? So , you 're in the gang now . Since I can 't seem to find work as Companion , I might as well become a petty thief like you . Petty ? - I didn 't mean petty . - What did you mean ? That 's Chinese for " petty . " No , that 's a narrow- - There are nuances of meaning- - Maybe you should 've stuck with your wiles . Don 't put all of this on me , Mal . You know you haven 't been after serious work- - Serious work ? You want to know- - If- - I- - - What ? - Nothin ' . All right . Tell me more about this job of yours . The mark 's name is Durran Haymer . He may be one of the biggest collectors of Earth-That-Was artifacts in the ' verse . Guy 's got warehouses full of stuff . But his prize piece is sitting in his parlor- - an antiquity of unspeakable value- - the Lassiter . The original handheld laser pistol . One of only two known to still exist . The forerunner of all modern laser technology . Haymer got lucky , picked it up during the war for nothing . But it wasn 't just luck . - Tell ' em . - Haymer 's Alliance . Bio-weapons expert during the war . He 'd target neighborhoods with valuables ... wipe out every living soul without ever damaging the goods . Go in , take whatever he wanted . Now he 's livin ' fat on a private estate on Bellerophon . I 've managed to get ahold ... of his schedule for the next eighteen months ... a layout of the estate grounds and every security code for the place . Saffron has a notion we can walk right in there , take the Lassiter right off his shelf . - I 'm confused- - - You 're asking yourself ... if I 've got the security codes , why don 't I grab it for myself ? No , actually , I was wondering ... what 's she doing on this ship ? - Didn 't she try to kill us ? - Please . Nobody died last time . We 're in space . How 'd she get here ? - She hitched . - I don 't recall pulling over . The point is this ain 't no wobbly headed doll caper . This here 's history . Okay , I got a question . If she 's got the security codes , why don 't shejust walk in and grab it herself ? . Good point . Getting through the door and putting our hands on the Lassiter , it 's easy . - Getting out with it , that 's the tricky part . - It 's tagged and coded . Second it passes through the door- - alarms , security , feds . This isn 't a one-woman operation . - To do this right I 'm gonna need- - - Idiots . - Partners . - Dupes . That 's what you 'll all be if you trust her . Could be that 's so . Lord knows , ain 't none of us here criminal masterminds . So , if you 've got something better , Inara , something not petty ... well , we 'd sure be willing to hear it . So , the question remains- - how do we get the artifact out without setting off the alarms ? - This the layout ? - Full blueprints of the entire grounds . Could be we look hard enough we 'll find a way . You dig into that , little Kaylee . Zoe ? You ain 't said a word . Time to weigh in . Take sounds ripe enough , assuming we can fence it . I know a guy on Persephone- - already has half dozen buyers on the bid . But Inara ain 't wrong . - She can 't be trusted . - I ain 't asking ' you to trust her . - I 'll be with her on the inside the whole time . - See there ? All you gotta do to be a rich woman , hon , is get over it . Okay . I 'm in . Captain says you 're to stay put . Doesn 't want you to run afoul of his blushing psychotic bride . She figures out who you are , she 'll turn you in before you can say ... " Don 't turn me in , lady . " This bounty on us just keeps getting more exciting . Well , I wouldn 't know . She 's a liar . That don 't exactly set her apart from the rest of us . The plunder sounds fun enough . She 's a liar , and no good will come of her . Well , as a rule I say girlfolk ain 't to be trusted . - Jayne is a girl 's name . - Well , Jayne ain 't a girl ! If she starts in on that girl 's name thing ... I 'll show her good and all I got man parts . I 'm trying to think of a way for you to be cruder . I just- - It 's not coming . I was gonna leave you a deck of cards . Great . Another exciting adventure in sitting . Afraid . We 'll be okay . Why the captain is trusting that- - Not her . Jayne . Afraid ? Since when . Since Ariel . Afraid we 'll know . We should be on Bellerophon by oh-six . I figure the job should take- - - I really don 't wanna know . - At least it 's your kind of world . - Got appointments made ? - Minute we hit atmo , I 'm gone . I 've booked a few clients . Should help me get my mind off of Mal 's descent into lunacy . Zoe , don 't let Mal trust her . Everything Saffron is is a lie . She 'll get the drop on him , which , as far as I 'm concerned , is what he richly deserves . I ain 't sayin ' it ain 't risky . Don 't count Mal out , though . - He just knows the estate is- - - No details . I meant that . Just be careful . See ya when we 're wealthy . Hey , you give me a hand in here . No wandering 'about , remember ? Or I 'll stick you back in your crate . Bellerophon Estates- - home to the rich and paranoid . Gracious living , ocean views and state-of-the-art security ... including local patrols and ... multi-code keys needed at all entrances and exits . - Which we have . - Right . You and Mal will split off in shuttle two as we make our approach . There 's a landing port just south of the main house . Prepare for landing . You ready ? Ready . Haymer 's throwing a big party this weekend ... so you should have no trouble blending in with the hired help who 'll be there setting up . All you gotta do is get through the back door . That shouldn 't be a problem , unless someone has been less than truthful . The parlor with the Lassiter is on the ninth floor . You 'll have to disable the display . Won 't be any trouble . Once you get the goods , you can 't take it out the front door ... nor the back door , nor any door . Every piece of pretty is tagged for the scanners . - So what do we do ? - You wanna tell ' em ? It was your genius idea . You chuck it in the garbage . All the estates on Bellerophon use this automated garbage drone system . You hit one little button , and the drone whooshes off with the trash . Brilliant . - Thanks . - Except it 's idiotic . The drones take the disposal bins straight to reclamation . Thirty seconds after we hit the button , the booty will be incinerated . Not if we reprogram the bin . Give it new coordinates . Once I override the standard guidance protocol ... I can tell that disposal bin to go wherever we want . - And where would that be ? - The loneliest piece of desert we can find . Here , Isis Canyon . The drone dumps the bin , we claim the goods when we 're all together again . And how do you plan to get to the bin to reprogram it ? You get to the loot , and we 'll get to the bin . All right , we 're planted . Take her up . That 's good , that 's good . Hold her steady . Hold her there . Clear . Which way ? Right . This should be it . - Let 's get to work . - Yeah . Okay , she 's set . Be careful . It 's hot . Gorrammit , Wash ! Hold it steady ! Sorry . Jayne , the dyna-ram 's live . What ? The dyna-ram , don 't touch- - Oh , no . Whoa . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - Where 's the trash chute ? - We passed it in the vestibule . Wait , shh . Someone 's coming . You ! You found her . You brought back my wife . Oh , my dear . My own sweet Yolanda . This boy weighs a solid ton . Doctor , you got yourself a patient to see to . Yes . I 'll take care of him . I thought I 'd never see you again . Forgive me . I don 't mean to make a show . - Please , I 'm the one who 's intruding . - Not at all . I owe you a great debt of thanks . - I just gave the lady a lift . - No , you 've done much more than that . You 've returned to me the only thing I truly treasure . Well , then this is a day I 'll feel good to be me . - Do I owe you any reward ? - No , uh- - The trip weren 't even out of our way . I promised him 800 square . - No , but we never agreed- - - Please . I 'd be embarrassed not to make some recompense . In my study- - Well , are you hungry ? You both look so tired . There 's food or- - - Yolanda , I 'm babbling like a moon brain . - Hush . We 'll both have plenty to say by nightfall . - Six years . - Is that all ? - From the day they found your shuttle . - They set on me at Parth . - These awful men . - That wasn 't me . I didn 't know those men . They said they wanted ransom , but ... they sold me to slavers . Also unknown to me . When you left , I thought- - - Well , you disappeared the same day as Heinrich . - Heinrich ? The security programmer . And he was young and ... I saw you two talking , and I thought- - But after they found his body- - They killed Heinrich ? Well , I guess he wasn 't useful anymore . - I never stopped looking . - I knew you wouldn 't . That 's the thought that kept me alive . We have so much time to make up . Well , that 's my cue to skedaddle . Let me get your money . You won 't disappear again ? Never . We gotta move fast . Yeah , he might come back and hug us in the act . You don 't know him . He 's everything I said he was . Oh , yeah , he 's a killer of men . Why , I 'll bet he even eats up babies . - You 're wasting time . - But let 's take a breath here , Yolanda . We 're sneakin ' into a place you could walk into as welcome as glad news . What 's the math on that ? The math on that is you not adding up that Durran would as soon cut your throat as- - - You would ? - If possible . Nope , that ain 't it at all . You 'd have knocked him in the brain were that the case . You don 't want him to know the truth . Unlike all the other- - I 'm gonna go with- - hundreds of men you 've married ... you actually want this one to think well of you when you 've gone . My God , could it be- - I 've actually met your real husband ? Congratulations . Anything else you want on your tombstone , you piece of crap ? Now I 'm intruding . Durran , this isn 't what it looks like . Unless it looks like we 're stealing your priceless Lassiter ... 'cause that 's what we 're doing . Don 't ask me about the gun , though , ' cause that 's new . Well , I appreciate your honesty . Not , you know , a lot , but- - - Durran , you don 't know what he 's forced me to- - - Stop . Yolanda , please , just stop . Don 't look at me like that . I said don 't look at me like that ! Almost done . I just gotta plug the interface strike plate in and- - That 's a pickup call . - How we doing ? - I can 't reach it . Wash , we need more altitude now ! Working on it , dear . Kaylee . Kaylee . Kaylee , Kaylee , Kaylee , Kaylee- - Okay , got it ! Let 's not get all worked up here . Are you really so naive ? Do you think your life is anything to me ? All right . No one 's killing any folk today on account of we got a very tight schedule . We 'll get on about our- - Drop it now ! Did you think I was a princess ? That I would stay locked up here in the tower ? With you ? I hoped . You 're a rutting fool . We 're in . Go . Go . Copy that . Saffron , you want to finish the damn job here 'cause we 're short on minutes . I 'm sorry , mister . - How long have you been with him ? - We are not together . - He 's my husband . - Well , who in the damn galaxy ain 't ? I feel so bad for you . Bad for me ? I 'm not the patsy being stole from . If you had half a brain you 'd have called the feds the minute you saw me . Oh , I did . Emergency signal . For kidnappings and the like . I love you , Yolanda . But I couldn 't think for a second ... that you actually came here for me . That would be them now . Men . Durran , peaches . Just call them off . Tell them it was a mistake . You need help , Yolanda . I 'll do anything you want me to . You know how I can make you feel . Hmm . Please . You 're embarrassing yourself . I 'm embarrassing ? Who 's the dupe on the floor ? I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time , but we gotta go . This is police responding to an emergency code call . Request entry all points . What are you doing ? Good security . Show some identification . Move . Nope . Let 's go . That had to be tough . Yeah , have yourself a great guffaw . No , I mean it . Six years ... knowing he was holding such treasures , and you didn 't move on him . I gotta figure that 's a job you told yourself you 'd never take . Till times got hard enough , and the one line you hadn 't crossed- - My name 's not Yolanda . Never entered my mind it was . I tried . I actually tried . I thought this is a decent man . - The genuine article . - A working man . Struggling to get by with the barest necessities on his private floating ' island . Yeah , he had money . I thought it would help . I thought if I had everything , then I wouldn 't want- - Heinrich the security programmer . You know , I 'd forgotten his name . Addressing the itch of curiousness ... you marry him too ? No . I didn 't kill him either . No . Don 't reckon there 's many you killed . Just put ' em in a position to die easy . - I should have killed Durran . - Right . The one guy who don 't have it comin ' . The man who knows you , still loves you , treachery and all . No , can 't have him walkin ' about . You must be loving this . A little bit . I seen you without your clothes on before . Never thought I 'd see you naked . Can people ever change ? Depends on the person . I 'm guessin ' ... the pain of this fades away , you 'll just go back to being what you are . What is that ? A brilliant ... beautiful , evil double-crossing snake . Cheer up , weepy . You made yourself a boatload of hard cash today . You can question the meaning of life on a floaty island of your own for a while . You won 't tell anyone about me breaking down . I won 't . Then I won 't tell anyone how easily I got your gun out of your holster . I 'll take that as a kindness . You just may be the most gullible fool I ever marked . And that makes you special . Well , you can riddle me with holes , Yolanda ... but that won 't make what I just saw anything but truth . - I played you from minute one . - You got me at barrel 's end . Who am I to argue ? - What 's your move ? - We 'll be setting down in the desert ... leave you to set a spell . Oh , and speaking of naked . No , now that 's just low . Kind of evens things out though , don 't you think ? Pants . I really don 't see the benefit to this . I mean , however I may slip ... you 're not gonna catch my crew with their trousers down . you 're not gonna catch my crew with their trousers down . Can 't turn . What ? Can 't turn . Not getting any tug from the aft alternator . That don 't make no sense . Unless- - Yep . - The filament on the grav-dampener 's stripped . - Who could have done that ? I can fix it , but she must have put a timer on the motivator and wet-wired the- - What does it mean , Kaylee ? We ain 't gonna make the rendezvous . We have to land- - Now . No ! No ! You dirty , dirty whore ! Yeah , you better run ! God ! Oh ! Where is it ? Oh , it 's not here ! Looking for this ? I wonder if it works . Oh , well , it 's still worth a fortune . Anyway , this works fine . Honey , you look horrific . What are you doing here ? - Oh , just my part of the job . - What part of the job ? You know , I put on the big act , storm away in a huff . Then I fly off , wait for you to double-cross Mal , beat you to the rendezvous spot ... and grab the loot before you can get to it . What ? You didn 't see it coming ? Uh-uh . You know , I 'm a little disappointed . Some of the crew 's performances weren 't quite as nuanced as they could have been . I thought they tipped the fact we were playing you ... from the second Mal took you out of that crate . Oh , well . Guess not . - No , you can 't do this ! - You 're not gonna die , you big baby . The authorities will be here in a few hours to dig you out . You can 't do this . I have a condition . Whoa . What going ' on ? - You got knocked out . - Huh ? Did we get a payoff ? Did we get the money ? Can you move your arms and legs ? Huh ? They 're not movin ' . Do you wanna know why ? Your spine . You hit it pretty hard when you fell . Oh . ' Pine ? Yes . So I gave you something to knock out your motor functions ... so you wouldn 't wrench it when you came to . Should wear off in a half an hour . You 'll just be bruised . Is ' pine okay ? How much did they offer you to sell out me and River on Ariel ? That 's crazy talk . Then let 's talk crazy . How much ? Anybody there ? Anybody else ? You 're in a dangerous line of work , Jayne . Odds are you 'll be under my knife again- - often . So I want you to understand one thing very clearly . No matter what you do or say or plot ... no matter how you come down on us ... I will never ever harm you . You 're on this table , you 're safe . 'Cause I 'm your medic ... and however little we may like or trust each other ... we 're on the same crew . Got the same troubles , same enemies and more than enough of both . Now , we could circle each other and growl , sleep with one eye open ... but that thought wearies me . I don 't care what you 've done . I don 't know what you 're planning on doing , but I 'm trusting you . I think you should do the same . 'Cause I don 't see this working any other way . Also ... I can kill you with my brain . Yeah . That went well . - You call this going well ? - We got the loot , didn 't we ? - Yes , but- - - Then I call it a win . What 's the problem ? Should I start with the part where you 're stranded in the middle of nowhere ... - or the part where you have no clothes ? - All according to plan . Really ? I thought the plan was for me to act as a fail-safe in case everything else went wrong . Like if Saffron disabled Serenity and left you for dead . Nonsense . You had a key role to play in this . - How sad would you have been if you hadn 't gotten to play it ? - Heartbroken . See ? All according to plan . Wash , take us out of the world . Zoe , contact Brennert and Ellison . See if they 'd be interested in fencing a priceless artifact for us . What ? Okay . Good work , Cap 'n . Thank you , Kaylee . Good day . Grr ! Arrgh !

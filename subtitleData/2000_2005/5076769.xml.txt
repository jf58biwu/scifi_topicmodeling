 The prophets sing . This is a holy time . B 'tanay , the time of awakening . Return to that dark place from which all life springs . A primal energy charges your blood , an energy of rebirth . The mind awakens and focuses on its task . Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay . Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay . Fresh flowers ? An afternoon on the holodeck ? It almost feels like we 're dating again . The secret to a lasting marriage- - keep the romance alive . I 'm not complaining . Lecture hall ? Guess again . Opera house ? Not another one of the Doctor 's performances ? This is a movie house . This is the old Palace Theater in Chicago , built in 1932 . Look at the detail on that crown molding . It doesn 't look very functional . Well , this place isn 't about function . It 's about fantasy . Chewing gum . There is such a thing as too much authenticity . Attention to detail . That 's what makes it fun . Protective lenses ? These will make the images on the screen appear three-dimensional . Let me get this straight . You 've gone to all this trouble to program a three-dimensional environment that projects a two-dimensional image , and now you 're asking me to wear these to make it look three-dimensional again ? Great , isn 't it ? Crick in your neck ? People didn 't go to the movies just for the movies , you know . Really ? What did they go for ? Well , I 'll try to demonstrate . I can see why this was so popular . Shh ! Maybe this would be more fun if we were alone . Computer , delete audience . Who 's in the front row ? Must be a glitch . No . That 's Tabor . This is an emergency . The gill-man has escaped . Please , please clear the ocean area . Get out , everybody . Are you okay ? He appears to be in a coma , but I 'm reading unusual synaptic activity . - What happened to him ? - I don 't know . I 'd like to know what he 's been doing the last few weeks- - where he 's worked , away missions ... I 'll access his duty roster . Was Ensign Tabor wearing these when he was found ? No , they were on the floor next to him . I don 't think they cause comas . Lights strobing at certain frequencies have been known to induce seizures . We should analyze the optical properties of this " movie . " When was the last time you spoke with Mr. Tabor ? About 10 , 15 minutes before B 'Elanna and I got here . He called to say the program was up and running . Funny ... Lieutenant ? When we were in the Maquis together , we used to joke that Tabor must have had his own personal force field . He went through a dozen firefights without even getting his clothes dirty . He 's still alive . Perhaps his force field is holding . Commander , I 've reviewed the sensor logs for the four hours Tabor was here . All systems were operating normally . Safeties were on-line . Run a level-5 diagnostic on the logs . Janeway to Tuvok . Report to Sick Bay . On my way . I 've found several microfractures in his cranium . They 're minor , but the pattern suggests that he suffered a trauma of some sort . There 's also evidence of subdermal contusions along his right shoulder . This man was attacked . It 's possible that whoever did it is still on board . Go to Yellow Alert . Tuvok , I 'm putting you in charge of the investigation . Aye , Captain . Security override : Tuvok-pi-Alpha . Commander . Crewman Jor , if I 'm not mistaken , your quarters are on Deck 4 . I heard what happened to Tabor . I was looking for a book to bring to him . I 'm afraid he 's in no condition to read . I was going to read to him . I 've heard sometimes it helps to hear a familiar voice . You and Tabor were friends . Do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt him ? I can 't imagine . Could you tell me where you were from 0700 to 1 100 hours this morning ? On duty ... in Engineering . You can check with Lieutenant Torres if you 'd like . That won 't be necessary . Thank you , Crewman . Harry 's found evidence that someone tampered with the holodeck sensor logs . Several files have been deleted . Any sign of an outside intruder ? No , nothing . I believe that a member of this crew is responsible . Tabor was well-liked . What 's the motive ? I have one suspect . Crewman Jor . I find that hard to believe . I 've known her for a long time . She and Tabor were friends . Close friends . She had access to his quarters . A close relationship is hardly a crime . It is my experience that emotional involvements often lead to unpredictable behavior . That 's an opinion ... not evidence . There may be other suspects . I intend to question all crew members who had recent contact with Tabor . I 'll check the internal sensors , see what else I can find . Commander . You seem awfully convinced that one of the crew was behind this . Now , you can 't tell me that 's the only logical conclusion , because I can think of a number of others . I realize my assumptions seem premature ... but I have a strong instinct about this . You might call it a hunch . I didn 't think Vulcans had hunches . I can 't explain it , Captain , but I can 't ignore it , either . Someone on board is responsible , and I intend to find out who it is . Pressure is fluctuating in 1 14 . You 'd better check the seals . Yosa to Engineering . Engineering ? Hello ? Computer , seal hatch 613-Beta . Unable to comply . Crewman Yosa to Security . His neocortical readings are identical to Tabor 's , and he has the same microfractures along his right temple . Who discovered him ? Crewman Jor . Chakotay to Crewman Jor . Jor , respond . Computer , locate Crewman Jor . Crewman Jor is in the Mess Hall . Crewman Jor . If this keeps up , I may have to open a special coma ward . Take a look at their names . Tell me if anything strikes you . Former Maquis . It 's either a coincidence , or they 're being singled out . There hasn 't been any hostility between the Maquis and the rest of the crew - for years . - Maybe someone on your crew couldn 't put the past behind them . " My " crew ? Our crew . Are you any closer to a diagnosis , Doctor ? They all have the same disruptions in their synaptic pathways . The same cranial fractures , contusions , but I still don 't know the cause , or how to reverse it . Your investigation ? Nothing conclusive . Five crewmen in comas , and we don 't have a single clue ? The assailant must have access to security protocols . There is no other way he could 've escaped detection . Well , you 'd better find a way to protect the rest of the Maquis . I 'm running out of beds . What is it you expect us to do ? Stay alert . Report anything suspicious to Commander Tuvok . I 'd rather report to you , if it 's all the same . He 's right . I 've never trusted the Vulcan . He 's betrayed us before . He was doing his job . He didn 't care about the Maquis back then . Why should he now ? We 're not Maquis anymore . Tell that to our friends in Sick Bay . Oh , come on , we put our differences aside seven years ago . It 's ancient history . Maybe history is repeating itself . Look , the truth is we don 't know what we 're up against , but the last thing we need right now is an outbreak of paranoia . Now , until we get to the bottom of this , I want you all to carry hand phasers . Nobody goes anywhere alone . We thought maybe the intruder left behind some kind of negative image . Displaced photons . Tom figured that if we dampen the photonic ambiance and enhance ... We can applaud Mr. Paris 's ingenuity later . What have you found ? Ensign Tabor . Now , take a look at this . Impressive . It doesn 't tell us who the attacker was , but we do know someone else was here . Can you extrapolate the assailant 's height and weight ? I 'd say between 170 and 190 centimeters . Maybe 7 5 kilograms . That describes about half the members of the crew . At least we can rule out Naomi Wildman . Is it possible to increase the resolution ? We 're already working on it . Keep me informed . Commander ? Stop it ; you 're making me nervous . It doesn 't make sense . This ship , with all its sensors- - how could five people be attacked without leaving a trace ? Good question . Maybe it 's a conspiracy . Ever since Voyager began sending datastreams back home , Starfleet has known that almost a quarter of the crew is Maquis . So ? Maybe they think we 're still dangerous . Maybe they ordered the Captain to neutralize the threat . Yes , that 's it . She 's putting us all into stasis . The comas are just a cover story . It would be easier than putting us all in the brig . It could be her . Oh , please . That 'll be all , Crewman . Please send in Mr. Kim . I 'm still trying to enhance the photon displacement . I appreciate your efforts , Mr. Kim , but I called you here for another reason . In the last datastream from Earth , you received a letter from someone named Dennis Kim . My cousin . In that letter , he spoke of your mutual friend , Maxwell Saroyan . You read my mail ? Yes . Isn 't that a violation of privacy protocols ? As the Chief of Security , I have the authority to suspend those protocols under special circumstances . And what is so special about a letter from my cousin ? The attacks began shortly after we received the last datastream . Your letter was part of that transmission . A lot of people got letters . 28 , to be exact , but only six of them matched the physical parameters of the photon displacement . Am I a suspect ? According to the letter , your friend , Mr. Saroyan , was killed by the Maquis a number of years ago . You got me , Tuvok . I confess . I was so distraught after hearing Max 's name that I fired my Captain Proton comatizer at every Maquis I could find . Your sarcasm could be viewed as subterfuge . Tuvok , it 's me , Harry . Do you really think I 'd be capable of this ? My personal views are irrelevant . I learned about Max 's death a long time ago . I was upset , but I don 't blame the Maquis , and I certainly don 't blame anyone on this ship . If that 'll be all ? Is everything all right ? This investigation is ... perplexing . It defies logic . I 'll keep you posted on the holodeck analysis . Doctor to Commander Tuvok . Report to Sick Bay immediately . On my way . I thought you might like to have a few words with Mr. Tabor . How did you revive him ? I didn 't . His synaptic pathways stabilized on their own . How do you feel ? Fine , sir . Hungry . What do you remember ? Not much . I was working in the holodeck , and ... then I was here . Was anyone in the holodeck with you ? No , sir . Do you know why anyone would want to hurt you ? No . What 's going on ? Thank you , Ensign . Crewman . I remember ordering everyone to work in pairs . Where 's your partner ? Uh , she 's , uh , uh ... Who 's your partner ? Lieutenant Torres . I told her we shouldn 't split up , sir , but she said she could handle herself . You know how stubborn she can be . I have a vague idea . Do you know where she went ? Cargo Bay 2 , sir . B 'Elanna ? Computer , locate Lieutenant Torres . Lieutenant Torres is in Cargo Bay 2 . Help me get her to Sick Bay . This is a holy time . What ? Security to Cargo Bay 2 ! Let the mind awaken and focus on the task . My mind to your mind . My thoughts to your thoughts . Captain 's Log , supplemental . Chakotay and B 'Elanna are the latest victims of our mysterious assailant . I 've decided to put the ship on a level-10 security alert . Nonessential personnel are confined to quarters , and security teams have been posted on all decks . Ensign , run a metallurgical analysis . Two more victims regained consciousness- - Crewmen Yosa and Jor . Their bio-readings returned to normal as if they suffered nothing worse than a good night 's sleep . Doesn 't make any sense . It is , however , a pattern , and a pattern implies purpose . We simply have to uncover it . - Any clues here ? - Not yet . I 'm beginning to think our perpetrator is a ghost . Perhaps we should conduct a seance . It couldn 't hurt . I have worked meticulously , yet he has outwitted me each time . How can you be sure it 's a he ? I can 't , but I am . Another hunch ? I can almost sense his presence . It 's as though he 's challenging me to find him . I 'd say you 're taking this a little too personally . - Maybe you should take a break . - No . You haven 't slept in three days . Get some rest , meditate , clear your mind . My mind is perfectly clear . I don 't want to make this an order , Tuvok . I 'll go over your scans . Fresh pair of eyes might help . Captain . Resist your doubts . Don 't question your mission . Filter out the polarized photons . Anyone you know ? Tuvok ... Computer , isolate the precise time index of this image . Stardate 54090.4 . Where was Commander Tuvok at that time ? Access to that information has been restricted . By whom ? Access to that information has been restricted . Tuvok , what 's going on ? Computer , override those security restrictions- - authorization : Tuvok-pi-Alpha . Restrictions overridden . Where was Commander Tuvok at the specified time ? Commander Tuvok was in Holodeck 2 . Computer , based on the most recent data , can you give me a better estimation of the intruder 's height ? 182 centimeters . And what is the height of Lieutenant Commander Tuvok ? 182 centimeters . Captain , I believe I ... lgnore your doubts . No . Commander , lower your weapon . Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay . Who are you ? Captain , it would appear that I am the guilty party . How is that possible ? I don 't know ... but for the safety of the crew , you must confine me to the brig . He wants to speak with you , but I advise you to remain outside the force field . Tuvok . Can you hear me ? I hear you ... but there is another voice trying to control me . Another voice ? Whose ? " This is ... a holy time . " What did you mean by that ? A primal energy charges the blood , an energy of rebirth . That 's what the voice is telling you ? It 's a Bajoran incantation . The voice is Bajoran . We need to get you to Sick Bay so I can run ... No ! No more scans . Leave me alone . Don 't question your mission . Get away from me . What do you see , Tuvok ? The Bajoran . Ignore him . Focus on my voice . Tell me what 's happening . I believe I 've ... I 've been attacking certain members of the crew- - the Maquis- - then investigating the crimes with no memory of what I 'd done . Attacking them , how ? Mind-melds . Why ? I don 't know . He is responsible . What did you do to me ? ! Commander ... Commander ! Is he a member of the crew ? Then who is he ? I don 't know . The day the first attack occurred , did anything unusual happen to you ? I was tending to my duties ... I received a letter from my son . A letter ? This all started right after we received the last datastream . I reviewed every letter ... except my own . Stay with him , Doctor . How long ? 29 hours . She woke up just before you did . They 've all recovered . We don 't know why . It 's Tuvok . Tuvok ? He 's in the brig . Apparently , he 's being manipulated by some form of mind control . Can he leave , Mr. Paris ? I don 't see why not , but he should wear one of these . There 's something I want to show you . Exolinguistics always seemed a little too ... theoretical to me . I 've decided to study musical composition instead . I would 've sent you my latest construct , but they won 't give me enough room in this datastream . Maybe next time I can ... A letter from his son . We found another signal embedded in the message- - a letter within a letter . Hello , Father . We received your last transmission ... Prophets sing . This is a holy time . B 'tanay , the time of awakening . Return to that dark place from which all life springs . The signal is calibrated to correspond with Vulcan synaptic frequencies . Tuvok wouldn 't have been consciously aware of it . Teero . Teero Anaydis . He was a Bajoran vedek . He worked with the Maquis . Doing what ? Counterintelligence . He was thrown out for experimenting with mind control . He thought it was a good way to recruit agents . Well , apparently , he was successful at recruiting our Tactical Officer . These incantations and symbols , they must 've triggered something in Tuvok- - preconditioned behavior , instructions . I should 've known you 'd show up again . Commander ? Teero was a fanatic . He 'd go to any extreme for the Maquis . He called the rest of us traitors for rejecting his ideas . Swore he 'd fight the war on his own if he had to . Why instruct Tuvok to mind-meld with Voyager 's Maquis 35,000 light-years from Earth ? I 'd like Tuvok to take a look at this message . Maybe it 'll jog his memory . Try to decode those symbols . It 's him . His name is Teero Anaydis . Teero ? He worked for Maquis Intelligence . Yes . I remember meeting him . I was undercover , doing reconnaissance on a colony near the Badlands . He was a vedek at the Bajoran temple there . Go on . We spoke briefly . He was interested in Vulcan culture . That 's all I remember . Maybe that 's all he wanted you to remember . He was developing some kind of mind control technique . We think he used it on you seven years ago . What is it ? I-I was restrained . Very frightened . What did he do to you ? I can 't remember . Try . I can 't ! Tuvok , if we 're going to help you , we need to find out . The last time you meditated , it helped the memories resurface , didn 't it ? You 've helped me meditate . I think I 've learned a thing or two about the process . Let me try to guide you . Where are you ? In a laboratory ... underground . Is Teero there ? There is someone ... It 's him . Describe what 's happening . Lieutenant ... Tuvok ? Tuvok ? It is Lieutenant , isn 't it ? I 'm sure your Maquis comrades would be interested to know your Starfleet rank . Don 't worry . I don 't plan to expose you . What do you want ? You . You 're the perfect subject . For what ? I 'm a student of the mind . Yours is remarkable , disciplined , orderly ... on the surface , that is . Beneath ... roiling emotions , repressed violence . In a sense , you 're two different men . One I could never hope to manipulate , but the other ... I have been trained to resist mind control . That 's the rational , logical part of you at work ... but I want to reach your inner fire , your spirit . Why ? Ple ... please ... please , don 't ... do-don 't ... Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay . Stay away from me ! Tuvok ... Complete your mission ! No ! This is a holy time . Commander ... Tuvok to Chakotay . Go ahead . Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay . Understood . Janeway to Chakotay . Commander ? Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay . What did that mean , Tuvok ? Tell me . This is a holy time ... a time of awakening . This Teero has awakened you to do what ? If you can remember , you can fight him . You can resist . What does he want ? To give us instructions . What kind of instructions ? Focus on your task . No . It 's Chakotay . What is it ? I 'm not sure . Sick Bay to Commander Chakotay . Computer , locate Chakotay . Commander Chakotay is in Sick Bay . Computer , deactivate the EMH . Commander ? Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay . I understand . Deck 1 . Why were you using mind-melds ? What did Teero want you to do ? T ... to awaken the others . Resist your doubts ! No ! Focus on me . Complete your mission ! Pagh ' tem ' far B 'tanay ! You don 't control me ! Good to see you , Commander . It 's good to be back . Janeway to the Bridge . Report . What the hell are you doing ? I think it 's obvious . I 'm taking control of your ship . Within the hour , all Starfleet personnel will be locked in their quarters . Step back in the brig , Kathryn . What 's Teero done to you ? He simply helped us remember who we are . We 're Maquis . We 've always been Maquis . The rebellion ended three years ago . You know that . In the Alpha Quadrant , maybe . Not on this ship . Torres to Chakotay . Go ahead . Deck 11 is secure . Acknowledged . We 're 35,000 light-years from Earth , Chakotay . No one out here even knows about the Maquis . It doesn 't make sense . There 's nothing you can accomplish . As long as we exist , so does the rebellion . That 's Teero talking . He was unstable . You said so yourself . We have no intention of hurting any of you . Your orders , Captain ? Take your station . Captain 's Log , Stardate 54101 . Voyager is now under my command . We 're en route to an M-Class planet where we 'll relocate the Starfleet crew . We 're in range . On screen . Looks like a nice place for a Federation colony . Take us into orbit . Tuvok , would you mind joining me in the ready room ? You wished to see me , Captain ? You can drop the formalities . This is a Maquis ship now . Vulcan brandy . I thought we 'd have a drink to celebrate . A fitting gesture . To awakenings . Awakenings . There are still 23 of our former comrades who aren 't with us yet . I was hoping you 'd be able to help persuade them . I 'm prepared to mind-meld with the remaining Maquis , to convey Teero 's instructions . It 'll be nice to have my old crew back . You 've been a big help to us , Tuvok ... but I can 't forget what happened seven years ago . You have a history of betraying the Maquis . It won 't happen again . We have a small crew . I have to be able to trust everyone , especially my Tactical Officer . Bring her in . Consider this a test of your loyalty . It 's set to kill . You said you wouldn 't hurt anyone . You 're in control of your actions- - not Chakotay , not Teero . Tuvok ? Don 't do this . This phaser is defective . Take her back to the brig . You pass . Now , we 've got some tactical issues to review . I want to reroute all weapons control to my command console ... My mind to your mind . My thoughts to your thoughts . Kim and Paris engineered a little breakout on Deck 6 . We 've contained them all behind a force field . We should begin the evacuation . Start beaming them down . Begin on Deck 2 , Section 01 . Belay that order . Tuvok informed me that this planet has an unstable atmosphere . Go to Astrometrics and scan for an alternative . What are you talking about ? There 's nothing wrong with the atmosphere . We don 't have time to debate this . Well , I can scan from here . Chakotay , what 's going on ? Stand down . Your weapon . I thought you might like your ship back . No more rebellion ? It took another mind-meld with Tuvok , but I 'm fine . Tuvok , you 're all right ? I am in control again , Captain . Whatever you said to him , it worked . It 's good to have you back , Commander . All ready for Attack of the Lobster People ? I am not familiar with that species . You will be soon enough . I haven 't completed my security rounds . You have now . Buttered or unbuttered ? Thank you , Neelix . How 's right here ? I saved you a seat . How long is this ... entertainment ? I 'm not sure . Tom said something about a " double-feature . " I 've been meaning to ask you ... how did you know that phaser wasn 't charged ? Chakotay doubted my loyalty . He wouldn 't have given me an active weapon . Not exactly ironclad logic . Call it ... a hunch . Remind me to pay more attention to your hunches . Shh !

I felt that would put her on guard . Her cut didn 't amount to much . I did tell her to check with her doctor , though . It 's an open door , Susan . Well , I felt negligent not to at least suggest it . Just be careful . Your compassion doesn 't work to your disadvantage . Or mine . Come on , Warren ! Keep your legs together ! Reach ! Reach !

Yeah , they 'll be standing outside Garsons Thanksgiving Night , You interview the first shopper in line , and- - Cheesy ? ! You know what ? Fox has already jumped at this story . All right , we 'll make arrangements next week . All right , talk to you later . Amy , muffins before dinner ? How many have you eaten ? Just one . We had half a dozen . No , I think maybe we only got 6 . Very funny . Dinner 's almost ready . Do I have to send daddy an e-mail ? I don 't even know what to write about . Well , tell him about the movie we saw . You said you liked it . I guess . And should I tell him you said hi ? Sure . Are you ever gonna be friends again ? Maybe someday . But not right now . What ? I don 't see no signs . As long as you keep your windows shut , You ought to be fine . Karl ? It was outside the window . Please , will you just set some traps tomorrow ? Well , you know , You live in the city , you 're gonna have rats . You know , that 's all there is to it . Karl . Traps . Tomorrow . Tomorrow . Ok ? Traps . Ok , i 'll put some out . Sure thing . Tomorrow . Good night . Good night . Don 't worry , honey . He 'll take care of it . Oh , mom , that rat was so nasty ! Why the scented stitch ? Always complaining . Lady , you gotta wake up , you know , to reality . You just can 't , uh , go around Killing innocent little animals , you know ? Well , she 'd understand if- - If , you know , she took a good look around to see who , um , her real neighbors are . Right . Well , come on now , wouldn 't she ? No , she wouldn 't . She 'd have to learn to get along with everybody . Please , Andr√© , for my sake . Maybe it will work . I beg you ! Now , don 't be scared , all right ? I did say I 'd put out a few traps . But I didn 't say nothing about setting ' em . You see , What she don 't understand is that every living thing has its place , Ok ? Like you guys , Ok ? You live over there . I live over here . We worked that out between us . It didn 't bother us . How am I supposed to explain something like that To somebody like her ? Who are you ? Hey , I haven 't seen you before . You 're a big fella . What are you , working out or something ? No , don 't be scared . Come here . Come here . Now , don 't be afraid . Don 't be afraid . Come on . That 's it . That 's it , fella . That 's it . Here you go . Aah , you little- - You good-for-nothing piece of rat shit ! Piece of shit ! That 's it ! Why 'd you do that ? ! Huh ? Why 'd you- - Ok , let 's- - Ok , I shouldn 't have- - I didn 't mean- - That was- - He had rabies or something . Guys , I would never do that to you . Please . Guys ? It was an accident . I swear , hey- - I would never- - Guys ? Guys , where are you going ? Aah ! No ! Hello ? This is Susan Costello . Yes , please . Put her through . What ? I 'll be right there . I will . I want you to monitor T.B.C. ( tuberculosis ) And her electrolyte output . Thank you . Hi . Is she all right ? She came in with a mild septicemia . It 's strange for someone so young with no drug history . She said she cut her finger At your store ? Yeah , it was on a carpet tack . 4 hours after admission , She 's got severe respiratory difficulties , Threatening renal failure . She 's very sick . If she hadn 't come in , she 'd be dead . I 'm 99 % certain It 's Weil 's disease . Is that some form of tetanus or- - No . From a carpet tack . It was a bite wound . I can 't say for sure , But I think it was a rat . Garsons does not have rats . No offense , but would you swear to that in court ? My god , was the girl 's lawyer there ? No . What did the doctor say ? Well , she said it was a rat bite . She 's almost certain that it 's Weil 's disease . Listen , if Garsons gets sued for a rat bite and it goes public , which it would , not only can you kiss your job good-bye , But so can everybody else here , including me . What can we do ? Keep your eye on the girl . Make sure she gets well . Fire our so-called exterminators , Yank their names out of the rolodex , And sue their butts to kingdom come . Discretely , of course . Bring in new rat people , completely unconnected . The best in town . I hate rats . Hey . You can 't park there . I 'm looking for Susan Costello . She 's expecting me . All right , hold on . I 'll go page her . She 'll probably give you a call . Excuse me , I don 't know if you can help me . I 'm looking for Susan Costello . Do you know her ? I 'm Susan . Oh , hi . Hi . I 'm Jack Carver . Oh , Jack Carver The , um , the- - Yeah , that 's right . You expecting some guy in a yellow t-shirt with a big , black rat on the back ? Yeah , something like that . Don 't get me wrong . I appreciate the discretion . All my clients do . So , uh , Somebody got bitten in a dressing room ? Not how we 're putting it yet . I see . How are we putting it ? We 're not , yet . Look , Ms. Costello- - Susan . Susan ... Your job and mine don 't match up all that well . People like me go around finding things that the Health Department sometimes needs to know about . People like you go around trying to get people like me to keep our mouths shut . Mr. Carver- - Jack . Jack , if you 're suggesting that people like me would cover up something like this- - Something like what ? A rat bite ? I thought we weren 't going there . We 're not . We 're standing here in a cosmetic department Wasting time . Ok , let 's start over . I 'm Jack , the person you called , and I believe there 's something you need to show me ? After you . It happened in here . She was over- - How many basement levels under the store ? Three floors , including the subway . See , she was over here and- - Three ? Yeah . She had a pile of clothes . She said she reached down , and--and- - I guess it happened then . I was thinking that maybe the rat went underneath the , uh- - All right , here we go . I got a possible entry point . Where ? Here . You 're kidding me ? That tiny crack ? A hole the size of a wedding ring is big enough . We had a rat outside our window last night . Here ? No , at home . 4 legs or 2 ? Let me guess . First time you ever told that joke ? It 's an occupational hazard . I 'm sorry . I 'll try not to annoy you . What is that ? Fiber optics . A little something I whipped up myself . It comes in handy . Oh , boy . Bad news . Lots of critters . Come here , take a look . You see where the wood Is all scratched and chopped up ? That 's rats . They chew . They chew even when they 're not hungry . Otherwise their teeth grow so long they can 't eat . They starve . Concrete , metal , wood . So you 're saying we have a rat problem . Certainly not giraffes . Look at that . You see that ? Oh , no . The rat people have been sandbagging . What do you mean ? Well , they cleaned up the rat litter , But they didn 't clean up the rats . It happens . Companies get overextended . They think they 'll catch up . They never do . Ty ? Yeah , listen , I 'm down at Garsons . I need you here , man . The rodes are real busy . You hear me ? Ok . Rodes ? Short for rodents . You know , clients seem to get upset if you go , " come over here , the place is crawling with rats ! " You know what I mean ? So , how do you get rid of the rodes ? Look . Depends on what we 're up against . How soon does the store close ? 2 hours . Good night , ladies . Have a good night . Have a good night . Sure you want lights off ? It 's a whole lot better in the dark . Susan , this is Ty , my up-and-coming apprentice . Ty , Susan . Who you calling " apprentice " ? I 'm the guy that does all the dirty work . Nice to meet you . Ok . All right , lights off . Here we go . Let 's see what we can 't see . Is that- - Oh , that 's not- - Where our little friends took a bathroom break ? That 's the ugly truth . See , rats are permanently incontinent . Shows up under the ultraviolet light , Which gives us an accurate traffic pattern . Check that out . Oh , no . There 's more ? That 's no big deal , really . I mean , some of our finest restaurants are a lot worse . Dispersal patterns like these , They can be cleaned up overnight . Oh , so that 's good . Not necessarily . We just started out . Come on . We got a little bit of action here . Oh , my God ! Unbelievable . Thanks for taking me , aunt Nyla . You 're welcome . Now are you actually gonna practice or we just gonna look at guys ? No . I have to practice my backstroke . Then we 'll look at guys . Ok , well , then let 's do it . Give me your towel . Ready ? Ok , go ! Well , given the fact that they haven 't destroyed much and these dispersal patterns here ... and here , it 's clear that your little visitors are recent . Now , the good news is that they 're still contained . We can eliminate them , But , you know , we 're gonna have to act immediately . All right , I 'm convinced . What do you recommend ? I recommend you close the store . Do you know what it would cost to close the store for one day , Mr. Carver ? Not to mention explaining it to the press . Can 't we just cordon off the third floor while you work ? Sure . But I 'm gonna have to file a report With the Health Department . Eventually . It 's the law . Ok , go practice . Amy ! Amy ! Amy ! Hurry up , baby ! Look out behind you ! Amy , come on , Baby , swim ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Amy ! Amy , hurry up , Baby ! Swim ! Swim ! Come on ! You can do it ! Amy , come on ! Give me your hand ! Give it here ! Well , these blueprints are great , but I need somebody who knows every nook and cranny of the store . Ms. Co fills the bill . With all due respect , I mean someone who knows the basements , the substructure , that sort of thing . I know what you meant . My recommendation still stands . If Mr. Carver isn 't comfortable , I can arrange for someone else- - Stop it . You 're the best man for the job , And you know it . He 'll see that soon enough . Excuse me . Hello ? Is she Ok ? ! What--what- - Wait , wait , slow down . What do you mean rats ? I 'll be right there . Ms. Page , my daughter needs me . Excuse me . Harry , the Health Department wants you to drain the pool . That 's gonna take 2 days at least . Hi . She said a rat tried to swim in her mouth . It was so sick . Hi . What 's your name ? Amy . Hi , Amy . Who are you ? My name 's Jack . This is Garsons' new exterminator , honey . Why would rats be in a pool ? Well , they can swim , just like us . They can hold their breath . They swim the Hudson River every day . They 're commuters . Amy , why don 't you go sit over here and relax for a second ? You had a crazy day , huh ? So , Amy , tell me- - Tell me what happened in the pool . What did you see ? Well , I was swimming , and then the rats just started coming after all the kids , And they chased us out of the pool . They chased you out of the pool ? You sure about that ? Yes , and they were even trying to bite us . And the biggest one was after me . Yeah , and how big was it ? Huge . Well , that 's actually small For a New York City rat , you know . Well , maybe it was more like this . But it was really ugly , and it was like the one that was trying to get in the window the other day . Remember ? Yeah . And it had its teeth bared and everything . This is really strange . It is ? Can you do me a favor ? Yeah , that 's good . Amy , that closet is clean as a whistle . I mean , you could have a sleepover party in there , It 's so clean . Promise ? Promise . Hey , honey , you wanna take a break And go watch a movie ? Yeah . Ok . Go pick out whatever one you want . I 'll be right there . I promise . Really . Go ahead . Be right there . Thank you . You 're welcome . Is this the window ? It was this one . Oh , well , you got a hole in the screen here . You ever keep this window open ? Sometimes . I mean , not since- - Oh , you 're using ... The vent . Yeah . Excuse me . Oh , sure . You really like your job , don 't you ? Well , the hunt 's fun . It 's not like my prey is an endangered species or anything . Rats are tough . They can adapt to almost any condition , Control their heartbeats . Only the most experienced Indian yogis can do that or come even close . They 're a worthy adversary . Sorry about that . No , it 's really- - All right . Do you store crumbs behind your radio ? I knew there was more muffins . You 've got a rat . Probably just one . Oh , we 're out of here . Wait--wait a second . Wait . That doesn 't make any sense . You get rid of the rat . You don 't remove yourself . We can 't live with a rat . Susan , where you gonna go ? Anywhere you go in this city , you 're never more than 5 feet from a rat . Actually about 9 per person in New York . Ok . Way more information than I needed . Listen , can you just find it and get rid of it ? If it 's still here , I can . Do it . Thank you . I want to make a brief statement . I 'm going to make a brief statement . Unfortunately , I 'm late for a meeting , so your questions will have to wait . What 's the media doing here ? Something about rats in swimming pools ? I am pleased to report no evidence of what was thought to be a vermin infestation . Apparently , a prankster threw several domesticated rodents into a swimming pool , panicking several swimmers . No one was seriously injured , and i 'm told The police are closing in on a suspect . Thanks . That 's all for now . That 's the Health Department for you . Come on . Ray . Jack . Looking mighty sharp there . Ray , this is Susan Costello From Garsons . Susan , Ray Jareth , Deputy Chief Inspector for the Health Department . Nice to meet you . What the hell was that ? I got an eyewitness with a completely different story . Come on , Jack . We need to talk . Jack , whatever you heard , could you take it and just put it on the shelf for a little while ? Could you do that ? Remember what we used to say ? Anything goes , long as It doesn 't hurt anybody or cost us money . Ray , the REC Center has a rat problem . Two blocks away , Garsons has a rat problem . I 've got a feeling it doesn 't end there . So , you want to tell me how sitting on this doesn 't end up with someone getting hurt ? Jack , I 'm not doing the sitting here . That 's coming from higher up , A lot higher . I think the City 's trying to buy a couple of weeks . There 's a big trade fair going on right now , some kind of show next week , Couple of major conventions . You start hollering the " r " word ( rat ) , closing places down ? Heavy people lose heavy bucks . We came here to report a problem at Garsons . I assume you don 't want to hear about that , at least for a couple days . I appreciate that . I want everything you got . There has been an unprecedented increase of bite reports , Infestations , localized here in midtown . I 'll give you copies of the reports . So , what about this Weil 's disease ? Until a couple of months ago , people had barely heard of it . Now it 's showing up at hospitals all around here . Around here ? You mean midtown ? Yeah , pretty much . Bites and sightings at fast-food joints , apartments , a library , a bus . And now the midtown REC center and one major Department store . This is big , Ray . It 's weird , Jack , these rats . They just keep showing up , keep coming out at odd times , anytime . Like they 're not afraid anymore . Yeah . They 'd rather bite than run away . So , you and Ray have a history . I used to work for him . He sold me the business . I guess it 's good to have the city on your side . It 's worked out well . Ray , he--he was always meant to be a politician , Believe me . How 're we doing ? Ah , this whole floor will be cleared out tonight . Good . Now , where the hell are they coming from ? I checked all the obvious places . There 's got to be another major port of entry here . What about the coops ? Coops ? Yeah . It 's an old store . It has false interior walls . They used to call them coffins . Security would hide behind them and watch for shoplifters . Oh , and then video came along- - They sealed them up . Coops . We 're going exploring . Oh , yeah . We 've got a rat plaground here . I don 't know how you do this . Beats 9 to 5 and fluorescent lights . I guess Jackie boy never told you how he came to the big apple With a drum kit and a dream , huh ? Then he settled for this . Really ? Yeah , well , Ty 's the one born for this business . He used to make a dollar a rat Popping them with his caliber .22 , clearing building sites down at the Hudson . Well , I had to pay for a very expensive comic book habit . There 's a ladder in here somewhere . Yeah ? Where ? Here . Right through there . Oh , you are the best man for the job . This must be how they traveled between floors . You Ok ? Yeah . I 'm Ok . Watch this rung down here . Need a hand ? Um , no . I 'm- - No , I 'm good . All right . Thanks . I got you . Ok . There you go . Thank you . Wow . It chewed right through that . Look at that . Isn 't that something ? You see rats everywhere , Don 't you ? One out of every 4 fires of unknown origin- - is caused by a rat chewing through What it shouldn 't be chewing through . they are everywhere . Is he always this cheerful ? The way he sees it , these rats work for him . What ? It may be in there . Sorry . It 's big enough for a whole lot of rats . Plenty of dark , wet corners for breeding . All right , so , where are they ? Well , that 's the big question , isn 't it ? We 've the end of the line . They 're not here . Aah ! Ok . Funny . A two-legged rat . Oh , here we go . Fantasy Christmas candles ? One of the essential rat food groups . Let 's get this to the lab . Is that where they live ? No , it 's their port of entry . We 're going in . Ok . Watch your head . Been through here , all right . I think we 're off Garsons ' property . 200 years of building ... Basements , access tunnels , subways . Who knows where this leads ? What 's that sound ? It 's gnawing . We 're getting close . I don 't like this , Jack . Which way do we go ? This way . Come on . They 're this way . They 're that way . They 're everywhere , man . Jack , this isn 't right . Let 's go back . Yeah , she 's right . We got to cruise . We 're right above the subway ! Yeah , this is more than I signed on for . You coming or what ? This is bad . Let 's go . We 're almost there . Come on . I 'm going back ! Yeah . Goddamn it , Jack , let 's go ! What do we do ? Let 's just , uh ... Walk out of here nice and slowly . That 's it . Watch--watch yourself . That was different . Whoo ! What about the rats that were just standing there looking at us ? Is that normal ? Well , that 's a new one on me . Rat-itude . Soon as we nuke ' em , I 'll be a lot happier . Whoa , whoa , calm down . We don 't know if what we saw is part of something much bigger . You better pray that 's not the case . The tunnels , ventways , and pipes all over the city ? Yeah . Well , we were certainly off store property . We 're gonna have to work with Ray 's people on this . You know that . Hey , you all right ? Uh , yeah . No . No , I 'm not all right . How do you kill them ? Well , we seal them off , And then we gas them . But , you see , rats , they build up an immunity to poison in two generations . That 's every 6 months . So , we constantly have to customize the pesticides . Don 't you run out of combinations ? That 's the game we play . Sure you 're all right ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Yeah . Well , I 'll see you later . Ok . So , it all comes down to a big hole in the wall . No . It 's more complicated than that . What we found indicates a substantial rat colony nearby . Confirming what we suspected . It 's a City problem , or State . They 'll have to call out the national guard or whoever handles these things . It 's not enough to just chase them over the fence , Ms. Page , and- - You tell Mr. Carver to patch up the hole in his wall , set his traps , and go home . And as for you , it is time for you to get back to your day job . That for me ? Not unless you like women 's lingerie . No , it 's for the first and hopefully only casualty here at Garsons , anyway . Ah , that 's very thoughtful of you . It 's part of my job . I would like to think you 'd do it anyway . Jack , um , there 's another part of my job I don 't necessarily enjoy , but I have to do it . Go ahead . Well , Ms. Page is very pleased with what you 've discovered . In fact , she 's so pleased , she feels there 's no need to pursue it any further than patching the wall and setting some traps . Susan , we 've got to move on this colony . The woman can 't pretend it 's not out there . Well , the can do just about anything she wants- - Not with me , she can 't . We don 't pull out until I say so . Well , she won 't authorize payment . Oh , well , then she 'll be in breach , Not to mention in deep trouble with the Health Department . Which doesn 't care right now , Jack . I was with you . Oh , please , Susan . You 're not- - Why are you reacting this way ? Well , what do you expect- - You have to see her point . She doesn 't want to pay for something the authorities are responsible for . Even if her store is the cause of the problem ? If her store is the breeding ground or the food source ? You don 't know that . I suggest you have Ms. Page give me a call . I 'll talk some sense into her . Trouble in paradise ? Garsons is trying to bail on us . That 's typical ! The bigger the name , Tte smaller the game , lady ! Hey , let 's take a walk . Come on , we 'll do some of Ray 's work . I mean , he 's in no hurry to do it . Right ? No . Come on . Come on , Ty . We must have come at least 2 blocks North . Ok , about halfway between Garsons and the midtown REC Center , But that would be , like , right about here , right below us . Well , what 's different about this street than any other street In New York ? Nothing . Nothing at all . We know those rats are different . It 's a rogue colony . All right , I 'm gonna make that lab run , see what they come up with . All right . Let 's see . Um , blood sugar , Calcium , and minerals all normal . On the other hand , Muscular development 's exaggerated , And these guys ' testosterone levels are off the charts . I don 't know if they 're disease carriers yet . That 'll , uh , just take a little longer . So , they 're more aggressive , And they have the muscle to back it up . Yep . What every little rat wants to grow up to be . Where 'd you , uh , where 'd you find him ? Man , the Rat Olympics . Where else ? You ever see anything like this , Artie ? Well , not in the natural world . We do get some pretty weird specimens Through here , though . You know , uh , lab rats . Some of the stuff the different testing facilities put these guys through , it 's really no surprise To see your occasional mutation . You mind if I do a little surfing ? Oh , hey , help yourself . Oh ! Sorry . That 's all right . Thank you . If she wakes up and needs anything at all , Please , call me . Ok ? Done . Now , listen , I think you need to get home and take the rest of the day off . Ok ? All right . Thanks . Dr. Wilson , ICU . Dr. Wilson . Hey , there . Hey . How you doing ? I don 't know . I just got really scared . You know what is it with you Costello women And rats , huh ? You 're not allowed to have better stories than me . You know that . Right ? All right . Ok . How 's she doing ? I don 't know . She 's just not getting better . So , Jack , I- - I want to apologize . Oh , no . That 's not necessary . Susan , you 're just doing your job . Right ? Yeah , but- - I 'm sorry . Sometimes my job gets in the way . You know , usually I 'm a really good team player , And the store has always been the team , And then- - Ok . What I 'm trying to say is , I want to help you . Excuse me . Jack Carver . Hey , it 's Ty . I 'm at Artie 's . He thinks these things might be altered . Altered ? What , lab rats ? Exactly . Now , I looked on-line at 3 testing labs in midtown , Including one on- - Poulson Street ? Bingo ! 1444 Poulson , Tekworth Labs . 4 blocks south of Garsons . You 're my hero , man . I 'll meet you down there . Later . Listen , Susan , I got to go do a little detective work . I want to come with you . I don 't think you want to come- - I want to come with you . Let 's go . Come on . I thought this was supposed to be a lab . Test labs don 't put up signs . Makes them too much of a target for animal rights groups . Deserted . Wanted to get in , right ? After you . Were you a juvenile delinquent ? No . I just think you 're bringing this out in me . You still never told me how you came to know every nook and cranny at Garsons . It 's easy when your dad 's a janitor . You 're kidding . Nope . It was the world 's biggest playhouse . That 's quite a picture . A little girl all alone in her very own Department Store . Didn 't last . Dad died when I was 12 . Maybe that 's why you went back . Oh , my God . The smell . One dead rat 's all it takes . I 'm sorry . I only do rats . All these dead animals . What is this ? Food . Ok , here we go . Notice from the Health Department to vacate . There 's a whole list of violations . So , what , one these people just locked up and walked out ? Yeah , but if they just walked out , there 'd still be rats in the cages , right ? Unless whatever they were giving the rats made them so strong ... they busted out on their own . And had a feast on all the test animals . Sure . They hung out here , got fat , probably even munched on the occasional stray dog or cat . Acacia Farnesiana . That 's a scientific classification , but that 's not an animal . Plants . What 's that ? Wait a minute . There 's a whole bunch of material on that right here . Look . They must have been testing the medicinal properties of these plants on the rats . Now they 've been out there multiplying For how long ? The lab 's been closed down for 2 years . You start with maybe 500 . A new litter every 6 weeks . That 's more than half a million . Jesus ! Hey ! Take a look at this ! Check this out . Oh , man . Looks like they chewed themselves a back door . Maybe to that tunnel they 're in . Maybe to a dead link . A dead what ? Link . Empty sewers left behind When an area 's redeveloped . They can be half a mile long . It 's loose . Ready ? Lift . Quick ! This little rat highway could lead anywhere . Hey ! Here 's Garsons , The REC Center , and Susan 's apartment . And the incidents , the other ones , according to reports , Here , here , here , and here . It 's all midtown within a 10-block radius- - South of 45th street , above 25th street , and Broadway , West to 10th Avenue . In the middle of it all , Right here , Right where we 're standing , Tekworth Labs . So , this is your rogue colony theory ? It makes sense . No way in hell these lab rats are doing all this . Why don 't you go in there and look for yourself ? The damage they did is unbelievable . Ray , look , you 've got access to toys now that I don 't . I need a remote camera unit So I can get down there and find them . I cannot have my people off working for you Every time you get some crazy idea . Listen , we could do this ourselves , quietly , no committees , no panels . I don 't think so . You know what ? This would a great story For the 11 : 00 News . So would the truth about the REC center . This is the last time , Jack . And stay out of that building Until my crew gets here tomorrow . Yes , sir . Those files . We should get them . I 'm telling you , he 's gonna take forev- - Jack . Got ' em . I can 't take you anywhere . Hey , Nyla . Hey , you . Will you shampoo my hair when I get to that part ? Sure , sweetie . And the special surprise rinse ? You got it . Thanks . Everything Ok , tiger ? Yeah . Ok . All right . Well , thanks . You 're welcome .

Let 's do this while we can . 5 ? All right , 10 . 15 . Uh , wait a minute . Are we talking about a toxic substance right underneath us here ? Oh , no . Don 't worry . It hits their nervous systems , not ours . They 're all over us , man . Uh , uh , back the camera off . Ok , get- - just get a little closer . All right . Up against the wall . I have to be careful .

They bred ' em in a lab . They escaped . They gotta be destroyed now . Now , Ray , before they spread . I 'm not doin ' anything until there 's been a thorough investigation . Ray , have you lost your mind since you joined forces with this city ? These rats are carrying Weil 's disease . They 're aggressive . If they get out there and crossbreed with the rest of the rats in the city , we 're really screwed . Do you understand that ? No . You 're going to be the one that 's screwed . If you stick your face in this mess again , I 'm going to personally suspend your license , And I will throw your ass in jail . That 'll fix the problem . I mean it , Jack ! That 'll fix the problem . All right , what do we do now ? Ok , I got an idea . But I need your help . All right . Thanks , Ms. Page . A man 's gotta do what a man 's gotta do . All right . Off you go . I hate rats . Uhh . I thought I 'd seen it all , Jack . Stick around . You might see another sight or two if we 're lucky . So , uh , which way do we send this thing ? Uptown . Towards the REC Center , about 4 blocks . Ty , listen . I can 't guarantee that phenylalkaphine will work . We 're gonna have to use something stronger . Shut up . Let 's figure out What we do next . All right . Stay here and make sure this damn thing does what it 's supposed to , Ok ? Gotcha . All right . Ready ? Am I ready ? Yeah . You ready ? I 'm ready . Let 's go . We 're outta here . You know , you guys from the city Have a habit of dropping in without calling . Well , you know how the Health Department is . Yeah , I heard that . You 'd think they were the secret service The way they strut around here . What 're you gonna do in here ? Well , Harry , we 're gonna bait the pool . Then we 're gonna line the perimeter with a series of low-level incendiary devices . Then we 're gonna wait for it to fill up with rats ... And then we 're gonna zap ' em . It 's fine with me , So long as you got the paperwork . Oh , this is bad . I lost a servo . I don 't have one to replace it with . Sorry . I don 't wanna hear that . Not at all . Hey--hey , that 's gonna hurt the pool . It 's Ok , Harry . The Health Department will pay for the whole thing to be redone when we 're finished . Don 't worry about it . It 's time to go . Ty , talk to me . Yeah , hey , I 'm here , man . Not gettin ' paid nearly enough money for what i 'm doin ' . Where are you ? Why aren 't you here ? Manual delivery . Little red wagon broke down . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . You get outta there . We got our first customers here already . You got places to bail ? About every 20 feet or so . Watch your ass . You don 't have to tell me twice . Oh , my God ! This is working a lot faster than I thought . Here , lay these out . We 're gonna set 8 of these around the pool . Space ' em evenly . Then we 're gonna wire ' em together And blow ' em all at once . No shrapnel , just one major concussive blast . As long as it kills them . Here , run this down . We 're set . Ok .

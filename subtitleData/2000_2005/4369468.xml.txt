 Spectacular , come on Ned , we need some human perspective . You 're sure I should get that close ? Yes , Ned , go on . Oh it 's perfectly safe our subjects are herbivores , plant eaters . Just try not to look like a vegetable and you 'll be fine . Keep it up Marguerite . Pretty soon you 'll be laughing out of the other side of your face . Come now , smile . You 're about to be immortalized . Yes think of what a lovely token it will be for what 's her name ? Marguerite please . Smile again . Gladys that 's it , the girl back home ? Won 't she be surprised when she sees what a great adventurer you are . Come on Ned , never mind her , now on the count of three ... one ... Bet she 'll be even more surprised if we [ 2 ] send her a picture of Veronica . Three It 's magnificent . It 's just a pile of bones Challenger . Maybe here but back in England this would be the eighth wonder of the world . If any bones are headed back to England they 're going to be mine . We need to finish charting this stream before nightfall Challenger . Oh very well . Damn . What is it ? It 's a cartridge , a rifle cartridge . So ? Well neither of us fired our guns . No rust and been fired recently . Fired by who ? Hey this one 's got your name on it . Is she ok ? Are you hurt ? It 's you . - I beg your pardon ? - You know him ? Of course I do , you 're Uncle George ! At the dawn of the century A band of adventurers set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of the Lost World Father ! Father ! My god . Renata what happened ? Renata ? Ape-men but I 'm ok . Look who saved me . He looks exactly like the photograph . It can 't be . Challenger ? Hargrove ! Veronica , Lord John Roxton ... Dr. William Hargrove from London . You 're a long way from home Doctor . How did you find me here ? Well we didn 't . We didn 't even know you were here not till now . You haven 't come for me ? Sorry Doctor but we 're still trying to find our own way off this blasted plateau . Yes well so many questions so much to catch up on . But I 'm being a terrible host . You 've must have had quite a journey ? Renata , why don 't you show Roxton and Veronica where they can sleep tonight ? Now really William I don 't want to impose on you . After saving my daughter 's life a hearty meal and a good nights rest is the least I can offer you . We could get an early start in the morning . You two get settled in . The good Doctor and I have much to talk about . - Brilliant . - This way . - Let 's relax inside hmm ? - William , that girl ? I 've been saving a bottle of brandy for just such a special occasion . Whoever she is ; she is not your daughter . I 'll be more that comfortable , thank you . Good and I 'll be right next door . Uncle George called you Lord Roxton is that true are you really royalty ? Well actually it 's an inherited title Renata ; it really doesn 't mean much anymore . I think it 's fascinating . Really ? Yes my lord , pray tell us more . Perhaps enough about me . It 's quite a set up your father has here . Ahh not this way . Just the two of you for all this ? My father really doesn 't like anyone to leave the compound . No problem just curious . What was that ? Ah ah nothing , let 's go back . It sounds like it 's coming from that building . Oh that 's father 's workshop . What 's in there ? He doesn 't like anyone to go in inside it 's too dangerous chemicals , gasses from his experiments . Fascinating . No , father would be furious . Well we wouldn 't want to upset father now would we ? Of course not . Thank you , now if you 'll follow me it 's almost time for dinner . You can 't expect me to believe such nonsense ? Renata is my daughter George end of discussion . Damn it William , don 't lie to me . How dare you . Have you forgotten to whom you 're talking ? I thought I was speaking to my friend . Yes the same friend who helped you grieve when you buried your daughter Renata fifteen years ago . You can 't actually believe that that girl is your daughter ? William , I have never been your enemy . I found her when I first arrived on the plateau . Her parents were killed by ape-men leaving her an orphan in the jungle . I saved her ... took her in as my own ... raised her as my own . And she has no idea ? None . I even told her stories of London , our happy times ... walking together playing together , just as I did with my real daughter ... - ... before . - Yes , I 'm sorry . Her memories are Renata 's memories . I won 't let you change them . William . I want your word damn you . This must stay between us . Renata must never find out the truth . But is that fair on the child ? What good would it do to tell her , except break her heart ? Do I have your word , your word as a .. ? Father our guests are famished shall I start dinner ? You ruined the picture . It 's wasn 't my fault . Are you admiring your handy work ? What 's that ? Isn 't it obvious ? Dinosaurs and me . No that . Hey Summerlee I could kiss you . - I beg your pardon . - Look ! - It 's a woman . - And around her neck ? Headphones ! It can 't be . It is ... radio headphones . And where there are radio headphones ? There may be a radio transmitter . Who hoo London here we come . Look Challenger I understand Hargrove is an old friend , but ah . Was an old friend . Something happened between you two . Nothing to worry about . And those noises we heard coming from the enclosure are they nothing to worry about too ? Dr. William Hargrove has always been a ... little unorthodox , shall we say . Secretive , a little paranoid , like most geniuses . You didn 't see the way Renata spoke about him . That 's right it was almost as if she was afraid of her own father . All right what aren 't you telling us ? Whatever you heard or thought you heard I heard it too . I can assure you there is nothing strange going on here . Dinner is served . Nothing at all . We 're lost - I don 't believe it . I guess we should have waited until morning . Must have been crazy to listen to you two . Us ? This was your idea . Let 's try tracking the woman in the photograph , you said . How hard could it be , you said . Veronica does it all the time . Ohhh all right , all right no need to split hairs . I 'll let you both off the hook this time . Will somebody please just get us the hell home . Bless you . Gesundheit Something ... I wonder what the ... - Let 's get out of here . - I 'm with you . All better now . Summerlee ? Marguerite To tell the truth George ... I have no idea how I finally got here ... I 'm only glad I did . Glad , to be stranded here ? It 's a kind of land where a man can still dream . As I remember the only thing we dreamt about was work . Too bad you had to give it up . Well I still dabble . Really ? Tell me more . Another time . Thank you for a wonderful dinner Dr. Hargrove . Off to bed so early ? We 've got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow . Goodnight . She 's right best make an early start . Is that Strauss ? I really should be turning in . This was my mother 's favorite dress . It 's very pretty . Father said they once they went to all the fancy balls together . Have you ever been ? To a ball ? Oh yes many times . Were they glorious ? They were long . Don 't you like to dance ? Oh I 've had my moments . I 've never danced . Never ? You know in London all the young men would be lining up to fill your dance card . I ... I 've begged father to teach me but he won 't . He says it makes him sad to think of mother and all the fun they used to have . I 'll bet she was a beautiful dancer . May I ? I don 't know how . Well then it 's the perfect time to learn my lady . Just relax and let the music take you . John ! John ! Veronica 's gone . Oh my God ! Ape-men ! And the tracks are still fresh . There 's still a good chance she 'll be alive . I 'll get the guns . - I 'll go with you . - No ! - I want to help . - It 's too dangerous I won 't permit it . Renata and I will stay in case Veronica makes it back . All right ... thank you . The ape-men have never attacked the compound before , they wouldn 't dare . Get to the house . Rise and shine . Hey those are our things . Who are you ? What do you want ? A little blood circulation for starters . How about untying us ? Ah the dinosaurs , I remember you . Exactly , but I can assure you we mean no harm . Hmmm a Chosen One Do the others know ? I beg your pardon ? And beautiful . Oh thanks . Not as beautiful as I once was . I 'm sure , incidentally about this little item around your neck ? Did you know that I was Queen of the nymphs and fairies ? - Of course you were . - You ! mortal man , you were my down fall . Look lady I 've never seen you before in my life . One like you ... I loved him and they cursed me . Exiled me to this earth bound body . Isn 't that always the way , - but about those headphones , I - Now I grow old like you and soon I will die away from my home my people ... unless I can break the spell . Tragic , now about that necklace of yours ? Ah you came to steal this . No , no not steal it . We just want to know where you found it . If I tell you will you help break the curse on me ? Yes of course , anything we can do anything at all . I need several drops of blood ... from a virgin . - Oh ! - Not you ? No - Oh Madam I. - Or you ? What ? What ? You . I don 't know why you have to do this ? It was your carelessness that took us down this path my dear . I told them not to go in the barn . Don 't you see I 'm doing this to protect us . But he 's your friend . It 's just like London all over again . They poke and pry and disapprove and ask questions . They won 't stop until they 've taken it all away . Everything I 've worked to build here gone . - I know father . - You don 't know ! My dear child you must trust me on this . Let father do what needs to be done . Where the hell are they taking her ? The tracks are still fresh . We must be getting close . Wait ! - We haven 't got time . - Damn it I should have noticed it sooner . - What ? - Take a look . They 're all ape-men tracks . That 's right , so where 's Veronica 's ? Maybe one of them is carrying her . One set of tracks would be set deeper than the others . So either whoever we 're following doesn 't have her or ... Or she 's already dead . Damn it I don 't believe it they 're flanking us . Using military tactics that 's not possible . They 've got guns . How the hell ? They 're outmaneuvering us Challenger we 'll have to make a run for it . What now ? Damn , where the hell did my ammo go ? Damn it , Hargrove . It 's time to swim . The fall will surely kill us . Either we jump or we 're dinner . Let me out of here . I 'm afraid that 's impossible . What kind of a monster are you ? You and your friends are the real monsters you would destroy years of research my whole life and Renata 's , crushed in an instant . What have you done with Challenger and Roxton ? This is the jungle ; we do whatever 's necessary to survive . Challenger 's your friend . Friends come and go . Only science stands the test of time . For instance this creature over the years I 've been altering his genetic structure . Just a couple more shots and he 'll be ready . Ready for what ? Breeding . That 's impossible . Not anymore . You wouldn 't . Come now Veronica , smile , you 're about to become a mother . Come on , Challenger . Well we made it . We 're still alive . How can you tell ? I hurt too much to be dead . Besides even in hell ape-men men don 't use guns . They do if they 've been genetically altered . He 's a bloody genius Hargrove . Are you saying he did this ? Yeah What now ? If the ape-men don 't have Veronica , Hargrove does , let 's go . This is insane . Hang on , it won 't be much longer . I 'm gonna pass out , all the blood 's rushing to my head . It 's a small price to pay to get us home . Yes , that 's easy for you to say . You 're not the one hanging upside down . Ouch ! Oh please . Oh I 'm going to be sick . Ah my hip isn 't what it used to be and I don 't see as well at night anymore . I was wondering would that concoction ... ? You 're human aren 't you ? All too human I 'm afraid . Alas , it doesn 't work on mortal borns . Pity . Hey wait a minute , before you go rushing off to your fairy prince . - King ... fairy king . - Whatever ... we had a deal . What you seek is a five minute walk . No more , no less . Hello , if it wouldn 't be too much to ask , would somebody get me the hell down ? Renata ? Renata ? Renata talk to me ! I thought you might be hungry . I 'm not . For later maybe . There isn 't going to be any later . Do you know what your father 's going to do to me ? My father is a great man , a great scientist . Your father 's insane . He sent the ape-men to kill them , to kill Roxton . He 's just protecting himself , protecting me . You don 't understand it 's because he has to . It 's London all over again . I don 't know what happened in London . All I know is if you don 't help me , I 'm dead . Please ! Renata , Renata Renata this isn 't right . I can 't . Renata ! Ah ! Damn ! There it is . Keep an eye out for any unwanted visitors . Hmm not the first man to lose his head over me . That 's not a very respectful way to treat the dead . Give me a hand . Can we get the radio out ? Well , It would be easier if I had more than this . It 's a poor workman who criticizes his tools . I 'd hurry up if I were you . Anytime now ... If I break the damn thing taking it out it won 't be of much use . If we get eaten it will be even less use . If you would stop distracting him he might be able to finish . I just need a minute . Malone ? Almost there . - Malone ? - Got it . Maybe if you distracted it . How - by being lunch ? Back away Marguerite it 's not worth it . - I can do it . - It will kill you . - No , almost there . - Marguerite ! Are you out of your mind that was our way home . - It wasn 't worth your life . - Damn it ! Let 's get out of here . If Hargrove is such a genius what 's he doing out here in the middle of nowhere ? His daughter was dying of a genetic disorder in London . He abducted her from the hospital and experimented on her desperate to save her life . And he failed . Those same scientific fools in England who thought me mad called it an act against nature . They forced the police to pursue him on murder charges then he just disappeared . Long way to run . I thought he was dead . I should have known better William is not the type to go quietly . My guess is Veronica is in the compound . We 'll have a hard time breaking her out with no ammunition . Careful Renata . I buried the real Renata fifteen years ago . I can only imagine who she is . Yeah well right now she 's our only ticket into that place . Don 't scream I won 't hurt you . - You 're alive ! - Just . No thanks to Hargrove . I didn 't want to be hurt you 've got to believe me . Is Veronica in the compound ? How do we get in ? - The door . - And the door 's locked . I stole the key . Good girl . Why are you doing this ? For you . Veronica ? No it 's a trap ! You should have stayed in London . So now what Hargrove ? Well science always needs martyrs . Just think of your sacrifice as a pathway to immortality . You 've gone mad William . No need to be hostile after all George you 're the reason I 'm here . You can 't blame this on me . Remember when I was the sane one and you were raving on about your lost world . Well I thought what better place to hide then in a madman 's dream . - I told you to stay in your room . - Why ... so she won 't know the truth ? He 's going to kill us Renata . No he promised . He 's lied to you Renata ; he 's lied all along . If you don 't tell her William I will . Tell me what ? - Not another word . - No ! Renata , give me the gun . I want the truth father . He 's not your father child . You won 't live out the day . What does he mean ? I saw him bury his daughter in London fifteen years ago ... she was Renata . Then who am I ? Your my blood ; my genes . Renata , the ape-men we saved you from , they weren 't attacking you . They were fighting each other ... for the right to mate with you . So who was my mother ? - It doesn 't matter . - Tell me ! I promise you won 't die quickly . This adventure wasn 't a complete loss . - She left us her necklace . - A lot of good that will do us . I wonder where she is . Oh she 's probably gone dancing with the sugar plum fairies . Come on it 's a long walk home . It doesn 't seem right to leave that old woman alone in the woods . After what she did to us ; I think she can take care of herself . Still wouldn 't it be grand if the spell really worked . Of course it worked , I 'm beautiful . You coming ? - Do you see that ? - What ? The creature , the little girl . What are you talking about ? The laughter , you didn 't hear it ? It 's been a long day Professor . What exactly did you see ? Never mind . Why didn 't you tell me ? I tried to tell you half a dozen times . All these years , all these lies . What does it matter ? you are what you are . And what exactly is that father ? Come on . Look at yourself , you 're beautiful . My mother was a beast , I 'm a beast . No , you 're a miracle my miracle . Keep going it 's almost there . Ready . I 'm free . - Let 's get the hell out of here . - After you . Renata . Thank you . William ? All in the name of science , aye . Father , Father ? I love you . Are you all right ? Now , no one can ever do this again . Come back with us . I can 't . - Renata ? - Please ... all my life decisions have been made for me . I have another woman 's name another woman 's memories . There is nothing left for you here . It 's where I belong . Besides what would I do in your world ? You could learn to dance . Maybe , maybe someday when I know who I really am . Thank you .

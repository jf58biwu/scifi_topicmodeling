 We managed to put Chu Tu behind bars but the operation was a costly one . You destroyed the squatter village and the Government had to rehouse the families . and pay the redemption Last time , during the operation You damaged the shopping centre as well . We paid over a million for the chandelier alone . But the taxpayers know police work doesn 't come cheaply . But they don 't expect to pay for the cost of someone 's heroism . Why didn 't you use the stairs ? Did you have to destroy that chandelier ? Do you always have to be different ? You 're right . This force doesn 't need superstars . We need disciplined policemen . I wasn 't expecting a promotion . Ka-kui , the operation succeeded through team effort , not just because of you . You should be grateful that we didn 't fire you . And the bosses wanted you disciplined for holding me as hostage . I managed to talk them out of it . I 'm very grateful . I worry about your individualism , you 're just a police officer . Don 't forget the point . As of today , you 're back in uniform . You 'll be assigned where needed . You mean he 'll be an errand boy ? ! I think you 'll be very busy . What else do you do apart from giving out tickets ? Calling all units , there 's been a serious road accident at the industrial Park . Traffic is brought to a standstill . All units in the area please respond . May , go home . I 'm working now . Just think of me as a member of the public . And I want to talk to a policeman . About what ? I think you look very smart in a uniform . Stop it , I 'm on duty . I 've brought you a cold drink . Thank you . Thank you , sir . I can 't drink here . Go on , you need a break . If I have a drink , I 'll need the toilet soon . Come on . May , I 'll get into trouble . Hello , superhero ! You still haven 't been sacked ? ! You 're lucky you 're not in jail with Chu . You think so ? The doctors said I only had three months to live . It 's called compassionate release . Three months can pass quickly , very quickly . My boss will be alive long after you 're dead . Don 't you know you 're threatening him ? Really ? In that case , he can sue me . Just be careful ! Drive on . Ka-kui ? Ka-Kui , Chu Tu is out from Jail . I know , so ? You already knew ? That 's good then . As a police who wouldn 't have caught a thief ? Who would you be scare of ? Just remember , there are 250,000 Royal HK Police at your back up . Bill , are there really 250,000 police in HK ? Just because wer are still recruiting new blood . Didn 't you notice newspaper ad ? What are you waiting for ? Go on patrol ! Hey , I 've talked to Raymond . He said you could carry a gun even after work . I 'm very happy tonight . The show and dinner were great . But you don 't seem very happy . Really ? I am happy . I wish you had enjoyed it as much as I did . Are you worried about Chu ? No . But I 'm just being careful . Maybe next week ... Hey , superhero ! Off duty already ? What are you doing here ? I can park here , you can 't give me a ticket . Yeah , you must have a nice view from flat B of the first floor . Am I right ? Go upstairs . How did you find this address ? It 's amazing what information you can get with money . People will do anything for money , you know ? What do you mean ? There 's a narrow stairwell in the building . If there was a fire , it 'd spread rapidly through the building . Because of the narrow access , the fire brigade couldn 't get in here . Therefore , you 'd better keep a close eye on her . If she were to get her pretty ass burnt , it 'd ruin her marriage prospects . Bastard ! Oh , hero , I 'm so happy ! Sorry . It 'd my fault really . A police like me have lots of enemies and you are threatened . I 'm not scared . If you don 't have any enemies , that means you couldn 't catch a thief . Could you rehouse yourself for a while ? Don 't worry about me . They are just morons . No . We could be noticed so easily while they won 't This way then , I 'll move to my aunt 's and hide for a while . Don 't think about it too much . But , if you threw a vase onto him then I 'll be dead definitely . May . Auntie . You 're on your own ? Where 's Ka-kui ? He 's still on duty . It 's OK , I can manage . I 'm not against you dating a policeman , but I don 't want him to spend too much time on his work . He 's stubborn , too . But he 's a good policeman . That 's why he has lots of enemies and you have to move home . I have to be careful . That way , he doesn 't need to worry about me . He ought to worry about you . Who are they ? It was them last time . I guess superhero isn 't here . Wait for me in the restaurant . Right . What do you want ? We have a score to settle . Ijust want to know where you 're going . It 's nothing to do with her . You must be her mother . Am I right ? Bastard ! You call me a bastard ? Yes ! I 'm the bastard son of a bastard ! I 'm not afraid of you . Come on . Auntie , why has your daughter fallen for a cop ? That could be dangerous . Living on the 19th floor is dangerous , too . What if you fall when you 're cleaning the windows ? Go ahead ! Don 't be silly . Go away . Off ! You bastard . Don 't grab my hair . You 're hurting me . You bitch . Easy , she 's just a girl . Think yourself lucky . If you were a man , you 'd be dead . I won 't forget this . Come on . You be careful ! Are you ok ? Auntie ! It 's your job that brings the enemies here . Look , May was badly beaten because of you ! I 've told you not to be with him . Did John Ko attack you ? I started hitting him first . He just hit me back . And they knocked me down . My backside still hurts . I can 't sit down now . How did they know you 'd be here ? They followed her . That 's how . They 're watching us from across the street . I wonder what 's next . Ka-kui , don 't ! He should go and scold them . If it 's that simple , then I 'll be relieved . ldiolt ! Are you crazy ? What would you do beside bullying women ? It 's my favourite hobby . Get the bastard ! You know the law , don 't you ? ! If they did threaten her , you could arrest them . I don 't care . I got carried away . That 's not a good reason . He reacted like anyone else would . He 's not anyone else . He 's a police officer . What you 've done is disgraceful ! It has disgraced us the police . I don 't think so . If a policeman fails to respond to a personal threat , it 's disgracefu . And it disgraces the law , too . You 're a show-off . So we won 't forget you arrested Chu . How can I explain this to the chief ! You don 't have to. I quit . You think that will resolve the problem ? Why not ? This is probably the best solution . I 'll leave now . Thank you for your support in the past . Goodbye . Ka-kui . If that 's your last word , then try to find a less stressfuljob . Bye-bye . I will . You think you can do anything because you 're cops . Don 't you know the law ? ! You can 't beat me up just like that . Kill me if you can . Shut up and sign this . I 'm not signing anything . No way ! I 'll sue you for every penny you 've got . I 've got lots of money . I 'll get a lawyer. I 'll sue you ! What ? ! No ! See ? You saw this officer try to assault me . He wants to beat me up like before when he hit me and broke my glasses . You 'll pay for that . You would dare to beat me up here ? Come on . What are you waiting for ? ! Come on. I 'm going to sue you , you 're going to jail . These youngsters have no patience . Bill , why didn 't you ask him to stay ? You should have said so ! I thought you meant throw him out of here . Now I know what this gesture means , I 'll remember it . Ka-kui , what 's the matter ? You don 't want me to be a policeman , do you ? Of course I do , I 'm proud of you . What do I have after being a cop for such a long time ? Just enemies . There you go ! That means you 've done your job well . If a cop has no enemies , there is only one reason : he hasn 't caught any crooks . I 'm glad they hate you ! It proves that you 're a tough good cop . Thanks for that . But I 've had enough . I resigned today . Really ? Are you disappointed ? You 're really quitting ? ! I 'm so happy ! Calm down . What 's she doing ? ! May , for these years , I haven 't treat you as good as I should . It 's my fault . I have three months ' holidays . Let 's go somewhere else to relax ! Ka-kui , you mean it ? Where to go then ? Bali . Good idea ! We haven 't travel for years . Right , so let 's go . It feels good to fly on the plane . That 's $ 5,540 , please . Right . I 'll see you outside . Credit card ? Sure . Here 's our catalogue , sir . Thank you . Bye . What clothes should I take ? You won 't need any in Bali . Don 't be silly ! I can 't believe we 're going . Ijust hope they won 't rip us off . No , they 're a big company . It 's trustworthy . It 's paid for now . Let 's cross our fingers . Fey ! Ka-kui . is this your area ? Yes . What 's up ? We 've received a bomb threat in here . Really ? Yeah . Can you help us out ? All right , then . Thanks . Ka-kui ! I 'lljust take a look , all right ? Sun . Just in time . What 's up ? We got a call about a bomb . Are you sure it 's real ? I don 't think he was kidding . He told us to clear the area . We have ten minutes . Really ? The manager said he 's nuts . Start clearing the building now . There are too many people . If it 's a hoax , who 'll be to blame ? I 'm used to getting an earful . If it is real , we 'll endanger lives . That 's true . What do we do ? Consider it real . Clear the building . Call headquarters . Where 's the fire alarm ? Over there . Ka-kui . We 'll go set off the fire alarm . Come on . Your truncheon . But ... Come on , I 'll bear the consquence . Follow me . Don 't panic . Don 't worry . Come back. I 've opened the till already . Have they paid ? What 's going on ? It 's nothing . What should we do ? They 're not taking any notice . Ka-kui . Don 't stay here . Go on ! Your attention please , evacuate the building . Everybody please leave immediately . There 's a fire in the building . Please leave now . Please leave in an orderly manner . Everybody outside . Be careful . What 's going on ? Why the alarm 's on ? How about our business ? Fay . What 's up ? Get them out of here . This is for your own safety . Go now ! What about you ? I won 't be long . You go first . Check the building . I can 't understand this. lt 's crazy ! Who 's in charge ? You talk to them . Please leave here now , the police will take care of it . Ka-kui . Ka-kui ! I 'm all right . You go home first . Hello , sir . Who made the call ? We received a call but we didn 't know if it was a hoax . Who set off the alarm ? It was me , sir . You may leave . Why did you do it ? Sir , when I was in the Police Academy , I was taught that public safety comes first . So I set off the alarm . Do you think you 're indispensable ? Superintendent . There 's no fire . But it was your men who cleared the building . Right . The Bomb Disposal Unit are coming . You won 't be needed now . Right. I hope this isn 't a hoax . Uncle Bill . So do I . Raymond . They want to see the head man . Shall I go ? Where 's the Bomb Disposal Unit ? On their way . What a mess . Did I do the right thing ? How do I do know ? Don 't ask me . Right now , we have to wait and see . Tell them to leave . You can go back in very soon . My ball ! When can we go back in ? Now what ? Very soon . Here 's your ball . Thank you . Ready ? The Bomb Disposal Unit are here . If they don 't find anything , the boss will blow a fuse . Uncle Bill , I 'm very sorry . I 'm not ... Red alert ! All units move in . Go and fight the fire . Go on . I suppose the good news is nobody got hurt . What are the losses ? The insurance will cover it . I 'm more worried about the damage to our image . I 've asked the press to cooperate and I 'm sure they will . But who did it and why our company ? It may not be against us . It could be someone who 's mentally disturbed . There 's a man on the line , sir . He says he planted the bomb . Have it put through . Put him through . Hello ? Hold on . Listen , we planted the bomb in your shopping centre . We want $ 10 million . Pay up or your ... other properties will get bombed . Let me talk to him . All right . But it 's a huge amount of money . We 'll need to call a board meeting . You 've got 24 hours . Don 't call the police . What to do then ? Must be some hoax . Yes . So what do we do ? Call the police . We pay so much tax . The police should do something for us . Call the head for me . Yes . Raymond , you were extremely lucky . It 's amazing that no one was hurt in the explosion . Thank God for that . And the Chu case , well done ! Thank you . But it wasn 't just me . That 's right . You 've proved yourself . You should handle this case . Do you agree ? Sure . Of course . Bill . This is a very tough case . That 's why they gave it to us . In our department , who do you think can solve it ? You 're the only one . I want a better idea . And it 's definitely not me . Maybe we could bring back somebody who 's on leave . Do you mean somebody like Ka-kui ? He has good experience . I don 't know . He 's unorthodox , impulsive . He 'll only give us trouble . We have to bear the consquence I agree he 's a little bit rash , but underneath he 's a good cop . I won 't let him do it . But if you think he 's our man , you go find him . Let 's see who 's the boss . Over there . Here ? Fasten your seat belt please . I forgot the sun screen ... Buy it when we get there . Did you get your passport ? When you were young ? Put out a call for Detective Chan Ka-kui . Sure . Attention please . Will Chan Ka-kui ... . Let me see . No , don 't look ! It 's cute . It 's horrible . .. Ka-kui please contact us . That 's you . Yeah . What 's up ? I don 't know . I won 't be long . Are you Mr Chan ? Yeah . I 'm afraid there seems to be a problem with your passport . Really ? It 'lljust be a quick check . What 's going on ? I 'll be back right away . Hurry ! OK Bye-bye . What do you want ? Thank you . You 're welcome . What is it ? I have a plane waiting . We have a problem . It seems that the bombing case has become a blackmail case . And it 's a very tough one . So ? This case is a real challenge . Raymond was hoping ... I was hoping that you might cancel your holiday . No ! I 've already boarded the plane . And I 've quit . I know how you feel . You 've been under pressure lately . But ducking out like this ? I 'm not ducking out . He said he 's not ducking out ! Raymond is a great admirer of your abilities . I don 't have any abilities . I 'm too impulsive . Impulsive ? More a man of action . If only I could control my actions . A true man of action is one who acts upon instinct . I think the police force needs men with discipline . Instinctive men have to be unconventional , even at the cost of discipline . If you did everything by the book , no cases would be solved . Am I right ? Absolutely . I 'd better get back on board . You 're right . Goodbye . How much is the ransom ? Ten million . That 's all we know . Do we have any suspects ? Not a clue . Do you think these people are insane ? Why are you asking me ? I don 't know . Have you traced the dynamite ? Why ? Yes . Why ? Simple . Dynamite is a controlled substance . So you either smuggle it in or steal it from a local company . He 's right . We 'd not thought of that . We must find their bomb factory before the company pays the ransom . If we do that , we can foil their plans . Why can you always solve problems so easily ? You 're the one who 's made for this case . You 're in charge . I 've got a plane to catch . Wait ! Ka-kui . You can go there any time . This case is a one-off . Go there next time . OK ? I 'd better talk to May first . Hurry up , then . Hurry up . Miss ! Yes , sir ? My plane ... It just took off . It 's taken off ! You 've missed your flight ! Trust them to be on schedule . I still have May 's passport . Damn ! It sure isn 't your lucky day ! Now what ? Uncle Bill , we better go . All right ? I ate something bad . That way , sir . Thank you . Excuse me . We 're police officers . We 're here to see Miss Wong . 30th floor . Thank you . Bugging devices . Bugging ? Be careful , Nixon lost his job because of one of these . If we are to solve the case , we have to know our targets well . We 're counting on you . Put them away . Miss Wong , there are two police officers here . Where 's the loo ? On your right . Thanks . 25 please . 24 please . Wait ! Uncle Bill , I 'm really worried about May . I 'll call Jakarta airport as soon as I get to the office . Uncle Bill . You should be ashamed of yourself . Haven 't you got any manners ? Let 's use the other elevators . Detective Chan to see Miss Wong . If you 'll please wait . Thank you . Ka-Kui Uncle Bill I thought you were used to taking the blame . That 's no excuse ! Gentlemen . I 'm Detective Chang , this is Detective Chan . We ... Please come with me . We 're ... I know . Mr Fung is busy now but he 's signed the papers . Excuse me . Excuse me , where 's the toilet ? Down the corridor . Here , sir . I 'm so sorry . It 's OK . Where 's your friend ? He had a sudden urge . There 's the chairman . That site is worth three billion . There would be a profit . Chairman , Yes ? Detective Chan is here . Thank you . Thanks for all your help . You 're developing the new estates very fast . Please sit . Welcome to all directors , managers and heads . I 've called this meeting to review the performance of our property portfolio and to set the sales target for the next year . You may all know that since the collapse of the stock market last year , the Hang Seng Index has risen 66 % . Let me show you the performance of the major blue chip shares . However , by the performance of the bank and property sectors , the outlook of the stock market for the next half year remains uncertain . In situations like this , small investors are likely to put their money in property . So we have to accelerate the pace of developing our new housing estates . Hi , you 're gorgeous . If someone asks the chairman for this , it 's $ 500 to get it back . Really ? Yeah . Bye-bye . What happened ? It 's a meeting . Did you plant the bugs ? Sure . And the desk ? All done . Was it easy ? He wasn 't against it ! What was said ? Something about houses . Really ? Where are you going ? I 'll take the next one . May 's here . May , you 're back ! May . You scumbag ! Let me explain . You ... You didn 't want me to come back ! You left me there and took my passport ! When I got there , I couldn 't do anything . Before I was sent back here , they detained me for ten hours in a cell ! Why should I keep my voice down ? When you take your dog for a walk , do you not take him home afterwards ? I 'm even worse than a dog . May , they 're watching us . What are you staring at ? It 's none of your business ! I want you to tell me in front of everyone what you think I am . What the hell do you take me for ? You 're my girlfriend ! Your girlfriend ? ! Open up ! Open up ! If that 's true , why treat me that way ? You even treat strangers better than me . Let me tell you ... it 's over between us ! Chan Ka-kui , you bastard ! Uncle Bill , did you make that call ? I needed to go to the toilet . You 've ruined my life . Wait ! Go away or I 'll run you over . Go away ! Don 't be childish ! Don 't grab my bag ! Go away ! Don 't even touch me . Go away . Leave me alone . Let me explain . I don 't want to know . I 've nothing else to say to you . May ! May , are you all right ? Stay away from me . Don 't touch my motorbike . Keep away . I don 't want you anywhere near me . Let me explain . Keep away . Why won 't you help me ? ! Just keep away from me . I don 't want to see you again . May . All right , get back to work . I want to see Ka-kui . Ka-kui , the boss wants to see you . I 'm sorry , sir . It 's all right . Do you want to call May to explain ? I don 't think it would help . Don 't explain to women ! This is my way to treat my woman . If a man 's not at home , it 's obvious he 's working . Excuse me , I have to go to the toilet . Don 't take any notice of his chauvinism . Go get changed . Are you going home , May ? It 's better than wasting my time here . Good night . Can I walk you home ? No thanks . Don 't be foolish . No , I won 't . Get me , it 's me you want . Don 't be foolish . You 're in this together . Don 't try anything . Prepare to die ! I really had you going ! I got the both of you ! Ka-kui ! I 've found it . Looks like you 're outnumbered . If I knew it 's merely an easy game I won 't call my men to come . I 'mflattered . My boss asked me to teach you a lesson . I 'm paid to do it . But I don 't need to dirty my hands , my men can take care of you . Get on with it . We 'll give you a chance . If you apologise to Mr Ko now , we won 't break both of your legs . We 'lljust break one of them . Cut the bullshit . Go on , kill me . Kill a cop ? No , I don 't think so . My boss wants to teach you a lesson . Ripping a few limbs off should do the trick . Get him ! Go ! There he is . Beat him up ! Go on , finish him off . Get up . Move over . Let me drive . I 'll turn you into mashed banana . It wasn 't my fault ! I was paid to do it . Keep away or I 'll shoot ! Shoot me ! I 'll shoot . Shoot here ! It 's not my fault . It 's not. lt 's not my fault . Next time I 'll kick your ass . It 's not my fault . May . May . Did they hurt you ? I 'm all right . You 'd better be careful . Why did you chase him ? It 's dangerous . I wanted to make things up to you . If it had been acid in that pistol and not ink , I 'd have been scarred . Maybe they wanted to distract you and then kidnap me . Then what would happen ? Ka-kui , I want my boyfriend to be gentle , not a savage . Do you understand ? Come in . Good morning . Police detective in park rumpus . Who was that ? Look ! I 'll check out the surveillance team . It was me . I know Chu wants revenge , but don 't take the law into your own hands . Sorry , sir . Anything I can do ? No , thanks . I can cope with it . Ijust want them to leave me alone . All right . But keep your eyes open . Now we 've got a surveillance team . They 're very good . Go and talk to them . Did he give you an earful ? Did he ... Let 's go over there . He just want to help . How to show off if there is no audience ? Sir , let me introduce . This is Detective Chan Ka-kui ; Detective Ng , Detective Mui . Hello . You guys intoduce yourselves . Sum Kin They are the special tactic unit . Please take a seat . They are expertised in following targets . But why ? Will this be useful for the case ? Because we don 't even know who did it . That 's easy . Follow anyone suspicious then you 'll know . Follow the suspects then we could find the their hiding place for making bombs . Just to follow them during the transaction , then we could arrest them . That simple ? Of course . Good , that 's why I always have faith on you . Hope you have a smooth cooperation . Detective Ng , could I have a word with you ? There will be room for you soon . Go . Bye . Bye . Detective Chan . Yes . What does that mean ? Because you are cool . Anything yet ? Fung said his shares would go up . That 's hardly relevant . And his girlfriend is a top model ! I 'm not interested . I 'll take it . You go call May . Go on . Ka-kui ! Listen . Your conditions have been presented to the board and they will pay . No shit . Do you have the money ? We don 't have it all . $ 10 million is a lot of money . Trace it . It 's from Tai Po . Check it out . He 's in Ting Kok Road . HQ calling all foot patrols . Are there any units in Ting Kok Road , over ? This is PC 12674 on Ting Kok Road , over . PC 12674 , check anybody leaving a phone box in the area . Are you stalling for time ? No , we didn 't call the police . Now we want 20 million . 20 million ! It 's impossible . Find it . Wait ! This is PC 12674 . Anything ? I think I 've got a suspect . Be careful . He 's very dangerous . He could be armed . Keep everything low key . Excuse me , you 're supposed to use the pedestrian crossing . Go on . Give me a chance , Officer . Can I see your id card ? Calling HQ ... PC 12674 , can you hear ... An officer needs assistance in Ting Kok Road . I 'm sorry , he isn 't here . Don 't be sorry . It 's the way things go . It wasn 't your fault . How long have you been in uniform ? About two months . Then you 're excused . Will I get in trouble for losing my gun ? What about promotions ? ! Don 't worry . As long as you learn from the experience , it 's OK . It happens to every cop . It won 't happen again . Do you think you 'd recognise him ? Sure . Phone . I could do with someone like you on the team . I 'll see to it . Thank you . Can you file this for me ? Hello . It 's Joker . Go ahead . News . What news ? A guy called Crazy Fai sells dynamite . Nine o 'clock , Hoi Wong Bar . Do you know what we 'll do next ? No . Really ? What do you want ? Are you Fai ?

Do you have some ? What are they for ? Fishing . You don 't look like a fisherman . What if I told you it was for business ? I 'll give you a good price . What do you say ? All right , I need to speak to someone . It 's not my stuff . Don 't go away . Thanks . Sorry , he 's out of stock but he 'll call me back . Stay here , I 'll be back when I 've finished . Thank you . Hey , you . Stand up . What 's the matter ? cid . On your feet . Hands up . I only came for a drink . A drink ? We heard you were dealing contraband . Eyes front . Hold it . Throw me your gun . Quick ! Stand over there . Easy . Don 't do anything stupid . Come on . Move . Come out here ! Get lost . You screwed me over . You bastard ! Why did you call the cops ? Stop ! Stop it ! Please , that 's enough . Please stop . Why did you do it ? To make sure you weren 't a cop . That 's why I called the cops to prove it . I can get what you need . Where is it ? Have you got the money ? It 's cash on delivery . Keep a look out . Is it good stuff ? It 's from the quarries . Got any more ? Yeah , plenty . There 's enough to blow up the Empire State Building . I just met him ! I 've never seen him before ! Do you think you can get away ? Would you like a coffee ? A cigarette ? Two spoons of sugar ? Yes . The temperature ok ? Ok . This will offend the law . I won 't do it . You seem comfortable . Then should you cooperate with us now ? Cooperation ? You want me die ? If you cooperate , you will walk out of here . We will keep everything secret . If needed , we will keep you under protection . If you three could protect me for my whole life , then I would consider it . Don 't talk that way . Even if we release you now , after you get out of here , we will find drugs on you . Well ... we could also find you guilty for raping young girl . Have you had good results this way ? Sure. it never fails . What 's the charge ? I 've seen a lot worse than this before going to jail , I 'll play along . You all seem like nice young ladies ... Have you not seen anything like this before ? No ! Stop ! I 've had enough . No , please ! Nice young ladies , huh ? Aren 't you going to play along ? I 'll sue you ! Say that again . Guns have a habit of going off when you least expect it . We 'lljust say it was an accident . Yeah . Escaped prisoner ! Good . Get my gun ! No ! I 'll talk . Why didn 't you say so ? Come on , sit down . Cigarette ? No . There are men in here . Show 's over . I have sold some explosives lately . One buyer was a fisherman . I 've known himfor long . After buying , he sold it to someone who used to blast reef fish . The other one buys my stuff to refill empty bullet shell cases and then he sells them as bullets . Yet he had only sold a few . The third guy 's name was Polar Bear . He 's a big-time dealer . He often hangs out at the Yaumatei Pool Hall . Taxi Target on a taxi . It 's BP5608 . Big mouth , got it ? Taxi number BP5608 .

Hold it ! Turn around . Police ! Who are you ? The guy must be deaf and dumb . Did you see three men come through here a few hours ago ? You ask him . Do you work here ? Do you sleep here ? Right . I got an answer but I have no idea what it means . You ask him . Take him to the station . It 's OK . You 're coming with me , just for questions . Come , it won 't cost anything . No need to lock .

You told me that you didn 't want me involved with your work , but I didn 't mind . You never spent enough time with me . Being with you was the happiest time in my life . But when you weren 't there , it was the worst time of my life . That 's not right . If I didn 't leave you , I 'd spend my life waiting for you to come home ... Can 't you stop it ? !

But we 've found out all his companies are losing money . Hey , how are things up there ? This is Mad Wing , his bodyguard . All of his employees are actually hit men . Be careful ! I 'll see you at the dye factory . Wait for me up there . Yes . This is Danny Chu , his nephew . He 's always surrounded by bodyguards . This is John Ko , the brains behind Chu Tu 's organisation . This lady 's name is Salina Fong . She 's only joined Chu Tu recently . It 's hard to tell how much she knows but she is involved . Our mission is to arrest all these drug dealers . The code name is Operation Boar Hunt . Have you got that ? Yes , sir ! Read your orders . You all have specific duties . Memorise then destroy . It 's crucial that you stay in position . Hurry , come on ! Attention ! Crime squad ! The Operation is underway ! Would you like a cup of tea ? Two teas please ! OK ! I 'll be back for them . There is a suspicious looking guy . Two teas please ! Tell the others , I 'll check it out . Kim ! Are you buying me a tea ? We 've been discovered . What ? ! Follow the guy in the red top . What is it ? This is Salina . There 's a suspicious looking guy ... What are you doing ? Police ! It 's the police ! The police are here ! Freeze ! Police ! Ijust heard some gunshots . They 've opened fire ! What to do ? Let 's break up the crowd first . Leave this area now ! Crime squad . What 's happening ? ! Police ! Get out of here ! Go on ! Hurry ! Quick This way . Listen ! Mind the residents and get the kids inside . Hurry up ! Go on ! This way . Move in and help . But we 're supposed to stay out . The situation 's changed . Move it ! Let me go ! It gets tighter if you move . Let me go ! I 'll keep you covered , you make a break for it . Protect the boss ! Go . There 's a female suspect up there . Take her back to the station . It 's only me ! Why did they open fire ? Don 't ask me . Calm down ! Help me ... Tak ! Cover me ! Tak ! You must stay calm . It hurts . Help me . You stay here and take care of him . They mean business ! Don 't forget the warning . Mind the villagers . But will the bad guys give a damn about them ? Who made you a cop ? Come here ! Be careful , Ka-kui . These guys are really mean ! Boss ! This way ! Get in ! You 're blocking the road ! Get out of the way ! Reverse ! Not this way ! You OK ? This way 's blocked , go back . Go back ! Quick ! Go back up ! The road below is blocked ! We 're stuck , boss ! Now what ? ! Go that way ! Let 's go ! Boss ! Quick ! Quick ! This way ! Freeze ! Mind the civilians ! Where have you been ? They 've all escaped . We went up to help . Who gave that order ? They 're gone ! You can 't blame me for that . Hurry , go ! Can I borrow this ? Tell them to get down . Stop that . Get down ! Don 't let them see my face . Tell the driver to step on it ! Quick ! Get down ! Turn here , turn ! Keep going ! Keep going ! Easy , boss , we 'll make it . Look ! Get up there , and get rid of him . Tell the driver to go faster ! Come down here and get him . Come down ! Turn the bus ! Go down the hill ! What are you doing ? Police . Stay back ! Boss , the bastard 's right in front ! Run over him ! Yes . Step on it , run over him . We 'll be all right . Freeze ! You 're under arrest , but you have the right to ... If you let me go ... this is all yours . There is a lot of money here , no one will ever find out . Smart guy ! Stop ! Well done , you guys . Give him credit if he praises you and don 't let it go to your heads . I know what to do . Ka-kui is the one who needs your advice . I didn 't do it alone . It was a success because of careful planning . That 's a great line . Don 't forget to say it when the Super comes . He 'll be very happy to hear that . Operation Boar Hunt was carefully planned . You were told to go in and make the arrest . You almost let the prime suspect get away . What happened ? Didn 't he give you clear orders ? Yes , but he said the operation was very well planned . What ? ! This operation was carefully planned . But it had a few flaws . Why were there flaws ? That 's because Ka-kui couldn 't handle the woman . Before we even got to the store , they heard her screaming . How did Chu Tu get through your men , then ? What do you mean by that ? Don 't point your fingers at each other . What ? ! The PR lady is here . Let her in . The press is here , Superintendent . Tell them no comment ! Hold it. I asked them to come . Then , tell them to wait . Ka-kui , you 'll be our spokesman . Me ? ! I can 't possibly . The speech is ready , just read it . Learn your lines . You can go now and don 't botch them . The Chief is well pleased with Ka-kui 's performance . A promising lad . After the speech , take him to do a police recruitment poster . And arrange for him to appear on TV . A role model ? ! The Chief thinks he 's a model policeman . He 'll be really good for it . What are the charges on Salina ? Drug dealing , resisting arrest and assaulting police officers . Drop all the charges . Really ? ! You played a big part in this operation . The success of this operation depended on skilful planning . He means you . Will you get a promotion ? As a police officer , I don 't fight crime to get promoted . I 'm not worried about promotions . Did Chu Tu try to bribe you ? He sure did , with millions . He could have bribed the whole force . Just kidding ! Don 't put that down . Can you two sit closer ? What are you doing ? Just saying hello . Don 't sit too close . Let me sit here . He 'll come this way , right ? Yeah ! Let 's start ! Straighten up your back . Open your eyes a bit more . Open your mouth . Wider . Wider still ! More . Forget it , just be yourself ! Ready ? ! The handcuffs in the middle . Try to be more energetic . Your plan wouldn 't work . Why not ? Remember , she 's Chu Tu 's secretary , not just anyone can get that job . Chu Tu 's been arrested and once he knows his secretary is going to be a witness , what will he do ? He 'll do everything he can to stop her appearing in court . Whoever we send to protect her will be in danger . Don 't be a cop if you 're not willing to risk your life . Put that line on one of our recruitment posters . We don 't have enough evidence to prosecute him . We must push him into a corner . Then we can put him behind bars . Who 's going to protect her ? I suggest ... I have someone in mind already . Great minds think alike . Good luck to him . You 're the only one who got bail . You 're really lucky . They 're here to see the Super . Please wait . Please wait . Right . You can leave after you 've seen him . You can go in now . Thanks ! Please sit down ! You can leave now , Miss Fong . Wait a second . Please keep this subpoena , you 'll need it to appear in court . What 's the charge ? Nothing ! But you 'll be acting as our witness . I 'm sorry ! My client isn 't going to do that . We 're not asking her . According to law , she has to do it . Inspector Chan ! Your job is to protect Miss Fong until she appears in court . Me ? Protect her ? Why not ? Great ! I don 't need his protection . As long as he doesn 't harass you , you can 't refuse . Inspector Chan . As an escort of the witness , you must be aware that the witness is often faced with threat , disturbance , and assault , or irritated by the intentions of such . It is your duty to see her safety and personal rights are intact . Yes , sir ! But can you send someone else ? You 'll get expenses for this assignment - HK $ 32 per day . It 's an old tradition , unchanged for years . I know it 's very little . That 's all . Can we talk to you alone , Miss Fong ? My client doesn 't answer questions without the presence of her lawyer . We won 't ask her any questions . We just want some advice for her own good . You have the right to refuse this . Let me see what they have to say . Mr Cheung ! Please excuse us . You don 't have to answer if they ask you any questions about the case or others . Get out of here ! I have to go , too ? What is your rank ? What do you want to talk to me about ? Nothing , you can go now . See you in court . Did they ask ... Let 's go . Ka-kui . Your tape recorder . OK . What did they say to you ? They didn 't say anything . I 'm your lawyer , you can trust me . They didn 't say a word to me . Why was it only her ... They 're coming ! How 's boss and the others ? I can 't bail them out . What about Salina , then ? She 's their witness . What ? Really ? ! They want me to do it . You should have turned it down . Stop bothering our witness ! Who are you ? I 'm a cop ! My duty is to protect her . If you keep doing that , I can charge you with interfering with the police . Salina ... You can only say goodbye or bye-bye . One more word and you 're under arrest . I 'll take you home . That 's part of my job . I 'll tell them nothing ! Now what , Mr Cheung ? I 'll see your boss this afternoon . All right ! Let 's go ! It 's dangerous for you to hang around outside . Let 's go home , shall we ? It 's none of your business . It 's for your own safety . I don 't need your protection , you fool ! You know what happened to the last witness who said that ? What happened ? ! Were they shot ? Don 't try to scare me . It won 't work . You 're right ! They were fine in the end . You can say whatever you want . You can 't scare me ! All the evidence points to the defendants . Only your situation is better . We 're depending on you , Mr Cheung . I 'll do my best . You 'd better be prepared for bad news . The chances are slim . If I walk away free , I 'll take good care of you . There 's still something we need to worry about . Salina is their witness . Is she really ? ! She 's been granted bail . The police even gave her an escort - the guy who arrested you . Salina doesn 't know much . She 's new . That doesn 't concern me . But she could say something bad about us in court . I don 't think she would ... All right . Call Danny for me . Tell him to take care of Salina . All right . Thanks a lot ! Keep the change ! See you later ! It 's dangerous to stay home alone . I always live dangerously . John ? I just got back . The phone is tapped . All right , I 'll meet you later . I 'm really scared ! You think you can scare me like that ? Help ! Help ! I 'm going to kill you ! Don 't go . I 'll get you ! You have to die ! I 'm going to kill you ! Go to hell ! Go to hell ! I got you ! I 'm going to kill you ! Don 't run away ! I 've got you now ! Go to hell ! Here I come ! Hide no where ! There 's no way out . You 're finished . I 'm going to kill you ! Don 't worry ! I 'm here ! She 's terrified . Can I go now ? You can leave right now . Hold on to him , I 'll call the police . I knocked him out ! Not yet ! He 's still conscious . He 's fighting me ! Keep away from us ! Please go now . You can 't stay here any longer . Don 't faint ! Go ! I go ... He 's passed out ! No ! He 's still conscious . See ? Look at me . Don 't ! Please leave here right now ! Go now ! Go on ! Go ! Hurry ! No more acting . Let 's go ! Leave him to me ! He 's fainted . This time is real . Let me hit him one more time ! Stop , or we won 't be able to identify him . I don 't want to do this any more . I don 't know him . They 'd use a stranger to kill you . Why kill me ? Of course , Chu Tu 's a ruthless man . Inspector Chou , it 's Ka-kui . Ijust realised this is a tough case . Can you send a replacement ? No ? ! I 'm not risking my life for a few thousands . I 've had enough of her ! I don 't give a damn about her any more . I quit ! Enough is enough ! Where are you going ? Home ! You 're supposed to protect me ! But you 're not cooperating . How can I protect you . What if I cooperate ? It 's too late ! I quit . I can 't believe it ! You cops have no sense of duty . I have . But there 's nothing I can do . If I stay here , I 'll get killed , too . I 'll cooperate . I 'm not forcing you . I 'm doing it of my own free will . You should come to my house , it 's much safer there . Great ! Look at you ! I 'll get changed ! Chu 's men could be back any time . I won 't change my clothes , then . Now what ? What is it ? ! I 'm checking to see if everything 's OK . Go back ! Come out . Why are you holding that ? This is your jacket . I told you to put it on . Yes . Follow me ! Use my car . Which one is yours ? Over there . Why are you not nervous at all ? I 'm used to situations like this . I told you to stay quiet , didn 't I ? Now what ? My son ! Yours ? Close the car door ! It 's me ! Give me my gun ! It 's in my jacket pocket . Help ! I 've got you ! Freeze ! Freeze ! Stay calm ! Give me the gun . Stay calm ! Keep away ! Go . Give me the gun ! It 's me ! Are you all right ? Where are they ? You scared them off with that shot . We must get you away from here , those guys are for real . Who was the guy at my house , then ? He wanted to kill you , too . But these are professionals . I see why you 're nervous now . Get in the car . You 're crying ? ! How could Chu Tu do this to me ? You can 't be that naive . Your boss is capable of anything . He can 't have you in that courtroom ! What should I do then ? You should tell the judge everything so he can put Chu in jail and then you 'll be safe . What should I say to the judge ? What rackets Chu Tu 's involved in , who his contacts are , who the dealers are . Why are you taping this ? It 's for my own reference . How long have you worked for him ? Four years . He 's a family friend . He used to give my mother money to buy me food . Now you help him deal drugs . I hardly know anything . You can still tell me what you do know . If you remember anything else , don 't forget to tell me . Do you have enough to prosecute him ? That 's for the court to decide . What you 've told me is very useful . Come in . Let me turn on the lights . It 's May . I almost forgot today 's my birthday . Are you all right ? Let me introduce you , this is Miss Fong . Let 's go . Are you all right ? I 'mfine . May ! They 've all gone ? That was quick ! It 's all my fault . She wanted to surprise you , but you brought me here . And I 'm dressed like this . Of course she 's angry . I 'm angry , too . I didn 't even have the chance to explain . She dumped the cake on me ! I won 't answer if she calls to apologize . I doubt she will . I knew she would be back ! What so happy about it ? I saw May . What 's wrong ? She saw me with our witness . I 'll go and explain to her . No need . Tell her to curb her temper . Why do I have to explain everything to everyone ? I 'm sick and tired of it . Do you want some cake ? What about a drink , then ? Orange juice , please ! Help yourself ! Do you live alone ? It 's too big , they 'd get me for corruption . I rent it with a friend . And he 's away . I 'm really sorry . Your girlfriend was furious when she saw me . Don 't worry . I was doing my job . Come on ! Come in ! You 'll be all right. I 'm leaving . See you ! I 'm just a cop now . But I might become a movie star and have to kiss ladies passionately . What would she do then ? She loves you , so she 's jealous . I 'll explain to her . What for ? She 'll never understand me . Aren 't you going to say something nice to her ? No way ! If I started sweet-talking , I 'd have a million girls . You love her a lot , don 't you ? To be honest , I do love her a lot ! But loving her is one thing , apologizing is another . When she gets home , she 'll call and apologize to me . What a waste of food ! Am I right ? She couldn 't wait to call me . Hello . Hello ? Is that your girlfriend ? It 's her . She 's crying ! Stop crying . You shouldn 't humiliate me in front of people . What ? ! If I was with a man , you 'd think I was gay . You 're so childish ! Curb your temper ! Let me explain to her . No need ! Curb that temper of yours ! You should show me some respect . Stop crying . Talk to you later . It 's time to teach her a good lesson . When did she come back ? Right after you went in the shower . So she heard everything ? The phone call ? ! Not again ! May ! Let me explain . She 's our witness , my job is to protect her . I 'm mad about what you just said ! I was just kidding . Don 't be mad . Why are you angry ? Why ? You just insulted me in front of her . How dare you ? ! Go away ! Please listen to me ! May ! May ... Are you all right ? No ! Are you happy now ? ! I hurt . Of course I 'm not . I didn 't mean to do that ! Your shoe . Here , put it on . Go away ! May , please listen to me ! No , I don 't want to ! Don 't be so childish . Listen to me , will you ? Let me go . Be careful ! I hate you ! Where is she ? I accepted her apologies , and she went home . Oh , you ! That hurt ? What did I do ? You really poked me ! You 're breaking it ! Don 't push too hard ! What an ugly thing ! Go away ! It 's the only one I got. lt 's broken . You got me all wet ! Let me wipe it for you . Please , no more ! No , don 't ! Not there , here . Here ? ! Be gentle ! That hurt ! This sofa 's hard , it 's not very comfy . Let 's go to bed now . Let 's go to bed . But where can I sleep ? On my bed . And you ? Next to you . You 're so protective . It 's exciting ! I 'm going to bed . Don 't wake me up . Women are weird ! Hello ? Ka-kui ? Wait ! He 's on the line . You 're late . We 're waiting for you ! He 's not here . I know it 's you . Quick ! Get that witness here . What was your duty on that day ? I was observing the squatter huts behind the site . The suspects were trying to escape , and I arrested two of them . Thank you ! Can I ask the witness a question ? Inspector Kim , you said you saw the suspects escaping . Did they pass in front of you one by one ? Or did you have a special device to allow you see them escaping at the same time ? I object ! I object ! The question played with the witness 's wording . Overruled ! Thank you ! No more questions ! Bring on the next witness . That 's my spot . I 'm in a hurry ! I want that space ! Nice parking , though . What ? ! She 's gone ? What have you been up to ? Now what ? We might lose . I don 't know . We 'll lose . How could you be so sure that one of the escaping suspects was my client ? He had the same clothes . In other words , you didn 't have a clear view of the suspects 'faces . I would say so . Are you short-sighted ? No , I 'm not . All right . No more questions . Next witness . I swear to tell the truth . I was at the squatter huts for the operation . The first , second , third and fourth defendants opened fire . I saw them jump on a bus . So I took a short cut and went down the hill . So I took a short cut and went down the hill . A citizen helped me to stop the bus with his car . After the bus stopped , I arrested the first defendant . He tried to bribe me , but I refused . That was very clear . Thank you ! You were at the squatter house . What time was that ? About 6 : 00am . What time exactly ? 5 : 55am . Let 's say 6 : 00am . In December in Hong Kong , sunrise is at 6 : 23am . Did you know that ? I didn 't know . Is that true ? I don 't know . Do you know the saying Darkness before dawn ? No , I don 't . The saying means that it 's dark before the sun rises . I might have heard of it . All right . If there wasn 't much light , should we believe you could actually see my client ? Believe what you like . I did see him . It 's your business . You shouldn 't ask me . You said you ran down the hill to stop the bus . Was the bus always in sight ? Yes . Why hesitate ? I was thinking . You have doubts ? ! Objection ! Don 't hound him . Rephrase the question . How long did it take you to go down the hill ? And was the bus always in sight ? For a while my view was blocked by the hill . Could it be that another bus overtook the first one at that point ? There was only one bus ! You 're lying ! Sustained ! Defence should rephrase his question . Could you be mistaken ? No ! There are four different bus routes on that road . On two routes , the buses run every five minutes . The other two , the buses run every six minutes . So 88 buses run back and forth on that road every hour . That 's more than one bus a minute . So what ? How long did it take you to go down the hill ? About two minutes . Exactly ? Two minutes and half . So at most eight or night buses could have passed by . But you said there was one . I say you 're lying . Don 't you know the buses are always late ? All right . Let 's give you the benefit of the doubt . Assume there was one bus and you could see it all the time . Which part was clearly visible to you ? The body . How much of the body ? All of it ! You 're lying ! What 's he doing ? You could see only one side of this bus . At most , only half of it . You couldn 't see the other half . Am I right ? Yes . And anything could have happened on the side you couldn 't see . Yes . So if someone jumped off , you couldn 't see him , could you ? No . Speak louder . I could have jumped off , he couldn 't . Just answer the question . I mean it ! You try jumping from a moving bus ! Control yourself ! If that 's not him why did he bribe me ? Why would he do that ? He offered me money to let him go . If it was you and someone pointed a gun at you , what would you do ? Objection ! Objection overruled ! Answer him ! I 'd give him all my money . That 's what happened to my client . Am I right ? No , I 'd already identified myself . There are many cases where criminals pose as policemen . Sustained ! Court will ignore that remark . Confine yourself to this case . I 'm sorry ! Consider this , a businessman is carrying company cash on a bus . A policeman chasing robbers stops the bus and points a gun at him . So the businessman thinks the policeman is a crook . So he tells the policeman to take the cash and let him go . Inspector Chan , isn 't that right ? Objection ! The witness needn 't answer . We already know the answer . He doesn 't need to say it . I conclude . Wonderful ! Now what ? I know what to do . He 'll get off the hook . He won 't . Your Honour , we request an adjournment . Our prime witness was delayed . Objection ! The Crown has failed to establish a case . There is insufficient evidence to convict my client . I request a dismissal . Your Honour . We have taped evidence from our witness . Tapes can 't be accepted as evidence . That tape is key to this case . Objection . I will not adjourn or postpone the hearing . That would be unfair to the defendant . I will grant him bail . But we will hear that tape first . Please turn up the volume . It 's a cheap tape . Thanks . Wait ! I didn 't erase that . Just let it play ! It 's coming up ! Oh , you ! That hurts ! What did I do ? You really poked me ! You 're breaking it ! Don 't push too hard ! What an ugly thing ! Go away ! It 's the only one I got. lt 's my treasure . It 's only a cactus ! What 's happening ? You got me all wet ! Let me wipe it for you . Please , no more ! No , don 't ! That was only orange juice ! That wasn 't what you think . Be gentle ! That hurt ! The sofa 's hard. lt 's not very comfy . Let 's go to bed now . Let 's go to bed . OK . But where can I sleep ? On my bed . And you ? Next to you . You 're so protective . It 's exciting ! Come on ! Please be cooperative . Stand back , please . No photographs ! Ka-kui ! I want a written report . Boss ! Here ! No pictures ! Get back . John , reserve a room at the country club . We 're going to celebrate . I 'm leaving now . Thank you very much ! Next time let 's hire him as prosecutor . This is Crime Story . I 'm so happy to see you all again . Our guest today is a brave police officer . Sitting next to me is Inspector Chan Ka-kui . Hello ! Hello ! Hello ! Hello everyone ! After cracking down on the biggest drug racket in Hong Kong , you 've become very popular amongst the people . Would you share this particular experience with us ? The success of this operation was due to team work . I was just a part of it . We were well prepared for the operation . What makes your department so special in the police force ? To be one of us , you have to be strong , alert , smart , and ... Boss . What 's up ? ! His photo is all over the papers and magazines . And he had won the Brave Policeman Arrests Drug Tycoon and our Thai source is out of stock . What ? Are they crazy ? They 've sold everything to Uncle Joe . They want hard cash . Boss , Mr Cheung is here . Please come in . Mr Chu , I 've received your cheque , thanks a lot ! I should thank you ! How 's my case now ? All evidence must remain with the court until the case ends . What does that include ? Your passport and bank account . You can 't use them now . If you 're found guilty , your assets will be confiscated . And besides , the bastards could jail me . Phone call for you , Boss . Excuse me ! Salina . It 's boring here . I want to go somewhere else . Not just yet . Can I come and see you ? Not now . You should stay where you are . The police are looking for you . I 'm planning a trip to Europe for you . Once you 're there , you 'll be fine . You just have to wait . It 's for your own good . Where were we ? We were lucky to bail you out . It would have been different if they had found Salina . I doubt they 'll ever be able to find her . Very well . I must leave . See you . Bye . Your lawyer is right . Salina 's a big problem . You can 't hide her forever . True . Snake Eyes says that stupid cop is looking for Salina everywhere . We should send her abroad . On a one-way ticket . Let 's use that stupid cop to kill Salina . Be sensible . Chicks like her aren 't difficult to get . Inspector Man wants to see you . Let him in . You paid him off , didn 't you ? Yes , I did . But he says he wants to retire and start a business . What does that mean ? He wants more money ! This way , Inspector Man . Hello ! Hello . Sit down . I 'm OK . I came to see you about ... Yes , I know . You want to retire and start a business . Good idea . Thanks for your money . I know you 're a smart guy . But I want one more favour . What is it ? I want Chan Ka-kui to disappear for good . You want to be a hero . I 'll make you a tragic hero . I 'll book you for that ! Hi , there ! Follow me . Inspector Chan ! If anything happens , you can reach me ... Reach you with telegram . My home . But you 're on patrol . That doesn 't mean I can 't pass by my house . I 'm going to the toilet , you stay here . Don 't stay there for too long . Hello , Police Station . You called , Inspector Chan ? Of course , any news ? On Salina ? I need more time . It 's not easy , you should know . Then you won 't get paid . I know . I 'm doing my best . What ? Wait a second ! Police Station , hold the line . Three more days , Snake Eyes . What ? That 's not enough time . What ? I 'll give you four days . Or you 'll be in trouble , when I get back to town . I 'm hanging up now ! Can I help ? I 've been waiting for ages . You want to speak Inspector Chan ? Hold on . Phone , Inspector Chan . Right , thanks ! Hello , this is Inspector Chan . It 's me . May . Who was that ? That rude guy ? Wait . I 'll give him a lesson . Didn 't I tell you to be polite on the phone ? You 're so rude ! I 'm really sorry ! Right . I just told him off . How 's it going ? What are you doing now ? Me ? Now ? Now I 'm talking to you . Have you had lunch ? Not yet . I 'm cooking some noodles . Have you eaten , then ? No . Wait a minute . Police Station , hold the line . May. I 'm back . Mum wants to have dinner with us on Sunday . Is that so ? That sounds great . Hold on . Police Station . My husband ... Your husband what ? He 's beating me up . Who 's beating who up ? My husband 's beating me up ! You husband 's beating you ? Don 't cry . I 'll put you through to a different department . I 'm coming on Sunday , wait a second . The line 's busy . Police Station , how can I help ? I 'm missing a cow . Hold the line . I 'll get you the right department . The line 's still busy . Police Station . I was raped ! Really ? ! I have to write down the details . When were you raped ? I wasn 't raped , but my husband 's mad . Oh ! It 's you , I 'm still connecting your call . It 's taking so long ! This is a big police station . Wait ! Who 's been raped ? Me ! I 'm missing a cow ! When were you raped ? Last year ! Why didn 't you report it ? Are there any pills I can take ? Pills ? ! I 'll find out for you . Hello , Police Station . I 'm missing a cow . All right . But you need to bring in a photo of the cow first . Hello . May , I 'm very busy . She wants me to name a place for dinner ? Give me a minute first . Hello . Where shall we go ? The Family Planning Clinic . Take a double portion of contraception pills . Free . May . Tell your own mum to take contraception pills ! What ? ! May ! I was saying that to someone else . Hello ? Hello ? Tell my mum to take contraception pills . My mum doesn 't need those pills . Police Station . I 'm testing the line , bye ! What ? ! Stuck in traffic ? No , not traffic . You 're late . If the roads were congested , I wouldn 't be here at all . You 're having dinner with us . Mum hates it when anyone 's late ! May , listen . I 've been waiting all day . You 're off that case . Forget about it . I can 't . I need to make a phone call . Hold on to the car . The hand brake doesn 't work . Don 't let go . It 's me , Snake Eyes . Chu Tu 's hiding that witness you 're looking for in his Kowloon villa . You sure ? Better hurry . They don 't plan to keep her alive . Is it true ? Would I lie to you ? Hurry up ! May . Are you coming ? ! That was Snake Eyes . I know where they 're hiding Salina . Don 't go ! If Chu Tu kills her , he 'll go free . I 've got to save her . I can 't let her die . What 's up ? Your car ! What now ? ! Taxi ! Call someone to tow the car away . And say sorry to your mumfor me . Be careful ! Keep the change . Thanks ! What happened ? I don 't know what they 're up to . Is anyone else here ? No one . They just disappeared . Now you know what Chu Tu is like . If you had listened to me , you wouldn 't be in danger . It 's lucky I got here . Otherwise , you 'd be dead . Let 's get out of here . Go . Stop ! Step aside . How did you know I was here ? I have my ways . You can 't be ... Surprised ? ! That 's not the only surprise . We were supposed to kill him . That 's right . The boss wants us to use a police gun . One cop kills another . What a perfect set-up ! Who 's killing who ? Let 's get out of here ! Move it . No , I can 't do it ! No ! Jump ! Move it ! Stop ! Go get her ! You little prick ! We 'll teach you . You 'll wish you 'd never interfered . That 's enough ! Take care of him . I 'll go down . Ka-kui didn 't shoot Inspector Man . We can 't take your word for it . We need evidence . If he didn 't do it , Where did he go with his gun ? The bullet that killed Man was fired from Ka-kui 's gun . Explain it . Policemen make lots of enemies . Someone is trying to frame Ka-kui . If it were anyone else but Ka-kui , would you feel the same ? You 're the boss . Don 't always go by the book ! Show some feelings for your men . I don 't want people thinking if a cop kills , he gets away with it . There 'll be no cover up ! One law for all . You want to nail him even more than the crooks ! Enough ! If you were me , what would you do ? Hi , May . I know . I 'll wait for you . One Cop Kills Another . Policeman ls Killed What should we do ? My mum is really worried about you . Ka-kui , be careful ! Ka-kui 's back ! Ka-kui ! Ka-kui ! Ka-kui ! I didn 't kill him . We believe you . But where have you been ? I don 't know . You must remember something . Were you drunk or with your girlfriend ? I was fighting Chu Tu 's men . Inspector Man appeared and pointed his gun at me . They took my revolver and shot Man with it . That 's all I remember . Nothing else ? You disliked Man , and the bullet was from your gun . Don 't you know ? I wouldn 't kill him over some petty differences . Who would believe that ? We must have proof ! That 's how the law works . But I 'm glad you 're back . Give me your gun . Call Homicide . Tell them we have the suspect . Ka-kui , don 't worry . We 'll do our very best to help you . Lock him up . And charge him ... with murder . How could you ? ! Freeze ! Ka-kui , what are you doing ? I didn 't kill anyone ! Don 't you believe me ? I believe you . But based on the evidence , I must charge you . Can 't you see I was framed ? You 're bloody stupid ! I 'll conduct a very thorough investigation ! Don 't give me that ! Let him go ! What ? What you are doing is dangerous ! Dangerous for him ! While we risk our lives out there , he 's sitting back thinking of chicks . We 've arrested so many bad guys , but he 's never satisfied . He just considers the result . And he uses dirty tricks to catch Chu Tu and that stupid idea of protecting the witness . So easy ? ! You only have to open your mouth and we have to risk our lives ! Ka-kui ! Shut up ! You got promoted at our expense . Have you ever thought of us ? If any of us dies , you need only write a report and turn up for the funeral . We have families , too . If it wasn 't for us , you 'd never have this office and all this other crap ! Ka-kui . Go away ! Come any closer and I 'll blow his head off ! Ka-kui , don 't do that ! Open the door ! Don 't move ! Don 't push me ! Keep back ! Don 't worry about me . I know what I 'm doing ! Ka-kui 's holding the Super hostage ! What ? Calm down ! Stay cool ! Ka-kui , calm down . Stay back ! Ka-kui , calm down . Let 's talk about this . Don 't come over . Don 't do that . Let 's talk . We 'll sort this out . Put your hands on the table . Now ! You 're being stupid . Give up before it 's too late ! We 'll help you . Calm down ! Trust us ! We 'll sort this out . I trust all of you , but I can 't depend on you . You 're making it worse ! Stop ! Don 't move ! Ka-kui . Don 't push him ! Don 't push him . Call in the snipers . Alert all units . Easy , everybody ! Ka-kui ! Get in ! Ka-kui ! Drive out . Let them go ! Don 't go after them ! It 's more important to keep Super safe . Where are we going ? Stop . Get out . I wouldn 't have shot even if you had run . I 'm not sure how to help you , but you 'll have a head start . They 'll start hunting for you once I get back . I 'll get Chu Tu before your men get me . Be careful ! Thank you , sir . No one knows where this Salina is . Let 's get a couple of chicks and have some fun . I didn 't set you up , Inspector Chan ! It wasn 't me . I had no part in it ! It 's for you . I 'll have it then. I 'm starving . Boss , I heard that stupid cop is on the run . Wasn 't he arrested ? He 's run away ! He 's got some nerve ! We should have killed him , too , once and for all . Where is Salina ? Mad Wing and Snake Eyes are looking for her . We 've heard nothing from them . Salina could be with that stupid cop . What 's up , boss ? Someone 's stealing my data . Who is it ? It must be Salina . Only she knows the password . Go get her . Alert our men . Call Mr Cheung . Yes . How long do we need to wait ? You 're impatient . I 'm not , but I 'm scared . You two stay here . Up there . What ? Call Inspector Chou ! Get that briefcase or we 're doomed ! Quick ! That way ! Ka-kui ! Why didn 't you go to the police ? Chu Tu 's men are here . You witnessed Man 's murder . I 'm counting on you . I 've got evidence on Chu Tu . They 're here ! Take her back to the office . Quick ! What 's going on ? Not your business . Let 's go . Beat him . Off . Come on ! I 'm not going . Kill him ! Catch ! It 's there ! Go and get it ! May ! Are you all right , Ka-kui ? Don 't worry about me . Get the briefcase ! OK . Go to hell ! Chu Tu ! Quick ! Hurry ! Ka-kui , stop ! Don 't do it ! Calm down ! Put that down . We 'll sort this out ! Ka-kui ! This is between him and me . He 's not worth it . There 's no justice . I have to take the law into my own hands . I 'm helping the weak ones . Don 't do anything foolish . I 'm going to kill him right here . It was Danny Chu who killed Inspector Man . All the evidence is in the briefcase . Are you all right ? May is hurt , Ka-kui . Take care of her first ! Take all the suspects back to the station ! You 're abusing your power as police officers . You 're hurting innocent people . You 're not above the law . Justice is for everyone . I 'm going to sue you for kidnapping , threatening and assaulting my client . I 'm not going to let you get away with this ! You threaten , beat up good citizen . I 'll sue you .. You lot are a menace to society ! He just proved it . Ka-kui , let go of him . This is entrapment ! You 're going to jail . How dare you treat a lawyer like that ? We 're so glad you 're here , Mr Cheung ! You ... You 'll have to help me with that report . Pardon ? Let 's write it together . I didn 't see anything . That 's enough !

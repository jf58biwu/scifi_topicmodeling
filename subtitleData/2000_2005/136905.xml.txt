Um , I don 't know . it 's been a while . I haven 't been sick this year , I know that . Okay . Do you remember me getting sick ? Um ... not a specific day . What--What 's this about ? Audrey , do you remember me ever getting sick ? In the 3 years we lived in this house ? In the old apartment ? Before Joseph was born ? Before we ever got married ? l--l can 't remember . Don 't you think that 's kind of weird , not remembering one cold or a fever or a sore throat ? What do you think it means ? Um ... I think it means probably too tired to remember . No more sitting in this room . I let it go on long enough . I 'm not going out there any more . I 'm not getting hurt again . This was the last time , I told you . You can 't do anything about that . You might fall between this chair and that television . If that 's what God has planned for you , that 's what 's gonna happen . You can 't hide from it sitting in a room .

Then you better get out there soon . I bought a whole bunch . There 'll be one of these waiting for you every time you want to come out here . They say this one has a surprise ending . Adult Eliijah . : This is from Fritz Campion 's own library . This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968 . it 's a classic depiction of good vs. evil . Notice the square jaw of Slayer , common in most comic heroes . And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro 's head to his body . This again is common , but only in villains . Businessman . : Mm-hmm . Eliijah . : The thing to notice about this piece , the thing that makes it very , very special is its realistic depiction of its figures . When the characters Reached the magazine , they Were exaggerated ... a sal Ways happens . This is vintage . Well ... wrap it up . You 've made a considerably wise decision . Well , my kid 's gonna go berserk . Once again , please ? My sonJeb- - it 's a gift for him . Eliijah . : How old is Jeb ? He 's 4 . No . No , no , no , no , no . You need to go . Now . [ Scoffs ] What--What 'd I say ? Do you see any Teletubbies in here ? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it ? Did you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it ? No ? Well , that 's what you see at a toy store , and you must think you 're in a toy store , because you 're here shopping for an infant named Jeb . Now , one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person 's valuable time . This is an art gallery , my friend , and this ... is a piece of art . [ Door Opens , Door Bell Rings ] [ Door Closes , Door Bell Rings ] We 're by appointment only . I got a card from this store . Congratulations , you have a mailbox . The exhibition isn 't for 2 weeks . This one was under the windshield wiper of my car . Eliijah . : How certain are you that you 've never taken ill ? 75 % . Eliijah . : Well ... that 's not certain at all , is it ? That 's hole number one . I 'm going to be extremely skeptical about all this . David . : About all What ? I 'm assuming you 've never been injured . Would I be wrong in that assumption ? Joseph . : Dad 's been injured . Is the child correct ? Yes , sir . in college , I was in a car accident . Eliijah . : Was It serious ? He couldn 't play football any more . Eliijah . : That 's hole number2 . That 's a big one . Mr Price , can we talk about the note that you left on my car ? Eliijah . : I 've studied the form of comics intimately . I 've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read . I believe comics are our last link to an ancient way of passing on history . The Egyptians drew on the walls . Countries all over the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms . I believe comics are a form of history that someone somewhere felt or experienced . Then , of course , those experiences and that history got chewed up in the commercial machine , got jazzed up , made titillating , cartooned for the sale rack . This city has seen its share Of disasters . I watched the aftermath of that plane crash . I watched the carnage of the hotel fire . I watched the news waiting to hear a very specific combination of words , but they never came . Then one day I saw a news story about a train accident , and I heard them . " There is a sole survivor , and he is miraculously unharmed . " [ Elijah Scoffs ] Eliijah . : I have something called osteogenesis imperfecta . It 's a genetic disorder . I don 't make a particular protein very Well , and it makes my bones very low in density . Very easy to break . I 've had54breaks in my life , and I have the tamest version of this disorder , type one . There are type2 , type3 , type 4 . Type 4s don 't last very long . So that 's how it popped into my head . If there is someone like me in the world , and I 'm at one end of the spectrum , couldn 't there be someone else the opposite of me at the other end ? Someone who doesn 't get sick , who doesn 't get hurt like the rest of us ? And he probably doesn 't even know it . The kind of person these stories are about . A person put here to protect the rest of us . To guard us . You think my dad 's a real- - Eliijah . : I don 't think anything right now . It 's apossibility- - one With many holes . joseph , don 't take another sip of that water . Go throw it in the trash . But , Dad- - Do it now , please .

" [ Scoffs ] This morning was the first morning that I could remember that I didn 't open my eyes and feel ... sadness . [ Scoffs ] I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me . [ Door Opens , Door Bell Rings ] I 'm gonna leave now . Good luck with your exhibition . So , what kind of job do you have , David ? You said you 've met guys like me in your work . What exactly is it that you do ? I work at the University Stadium . I 'm a security guard . [ Clock Ticking ] [ Knock On Door ] [ Knock On Door ] Hi . I 've come to a decision . Okay . I just want to ask you something , okay ? And you can be totally honest . I 'm prepared for any answer , and--and it won 't affect me . Have you been with anyone ? I mean , since we 've been having problems . The answer won 't affect me . I just need to know , you know ? it won 't affect me either way . No . [ Sobs ] Sorry , David . Sorry . Anyway ... my decision is ... [ Sniffles ] that I want to start again . That I want it to be like it was in the beginning . And it 's a big deal that you walked away from that train . I feel like it 's a second chance . And if you feel like asking me out sometime , it 'd be okay . [ Sniffles ] Okay . [ Sniffles ] [ P.A. Announcer Speaking indistinctly ] Jenkins . : Dunn . Go for Dunn . Jenkins . : It 's Jenkins . Look , We got a guy over at gate 17-C With a bogus ticket . Say she knows you . He Won 't tell me his name . What 's he look like ? Why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world , you chose protection ? You are a very strange man . You could have been a tax accountant . You could have owned your own gym . You could 've opened a chain of restaurants . You could 've done one of 1 0,000 things , but in the end , you chose to protect people . You made that decision , and I find that very , very interesting . Now all I need is your credit card number . That last part was a joke . [ Chuckles ] David . : You 're a big sports fan , are you ?

I got you a seat up in the yellow section . it 's in the nosebleeds , but at least you won 't get spit on . All right . How 'd you know that guy you bumped was carrying a weapon ? I don 't know . Maybe it was that camouflage army jacket he was wearing . Those guys like to carry hunting knives and stuff for show . You thought he was carrying a knife ? I thought he was carrying something , yeah . But not a knife . I got a ... picture ofa silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants . You know , like on TV . You have good instincts for things like that ? Like what ? Knowing when people have done something wrong . Yeah . Have you ever tried to develop it ? I don 't know what you 're asking me . Your skill . Look , I got to be down on the sidelines during the game . You can get to your seat right down here- - Characters in comics are often attributed special powers- - invisibility , X-Ray vision , things of that sort . Okay . I don 't want to play this game any more . it 's an exaggeration ofthe truth . Maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . But he might not have been carrying anything . But he might have been carrying a silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants . Jenkins Over Radio . : Dunn . I gotta go . Yeah , I know . I 'll be right down . One last question . What ?

And if that hadn 't happened , we probably wouldn 't have been together . How so ? I think we should talk about your rehab . You don 't have to answer if you don 't want to . So , tell me more about the quad machine . It prevents atrophy by ... I couldn 't spend my life with someone who played football . it 's pretty much that simple . And I don 't hate the game . I admire the amount of skill it involves . And like everyone else , I was in awe of the way he played it , but football , in many ways , is the opposite of what I do . You 're rewarded the more you punish your opponent . You know , it 's too much about violence , and I don 't want violence in my life . it 's not a thing many people can understand , but ...

I never would 've wished it to go away . You know that , right ? You had 2 calls afterJoseph went to bed . One came through while I was on the other line , but I wasn 't talking too long . Baby-sitter . : There Was an emergency With my sister . She tried to do Her own perm , and now she looks like she stuck her head- - Who called through ? Baby-sitter . : Um ... someone from New York , uh , about a security job . They Want to hire you . I didn 't know you guys were moving to New York . Thanks for telling me . We weren 't all going to move . Oh . I let the answering machine pick up the other call . Great . Look , let 's just be honest here . We 're just at the beginning , and I don 't expect you or I to change the course of where our lives were headed because of one date . And if you do go to New York , we can develop this . We 'll just be forced to take it slow . And in the end , I think that 's definitely better . I mean , this is our second time around , David . I didn 't expect us to get carried away , you know . Then I guess " congratulations " is the right thing to say . [ Door Closes ] [ Sighs ] [ Thunder ] [ Beep ] Eliijah . : David , it 's Eliijah . it Wasso obvious . it Was this one issue that brought it back forme- - Century Comics 1 17 . That 's Where this group , the Coalition of Evil , tried to ascertain the Weakness of every superhero , because they all have one , just like you . Your bones don 't break . Mine do . That 's clear . Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine . You don 't get sick . L do . That 's also clear . But for some reason , you and I react the exact same Way to Water . We swallow it too fast , We choke . We get some in our lungs , We drown . However unreal it may seem , We are connected , you and I . We 're on the same curve , just on opposite ends . The point of all this is We now know something We didn 't . You have a Weakness- - Water . it 's like your kryptonite . You hearing me , David ? [ Beep Beep ] [ Metal Clatters ] [ Breathing Heavily ] Huhh ! David . : Audrey ? [ Metal Creaking ] Unh ! Hunh ! Aah ! Gotcha . Come on . Audrey . Audrey . Hey ! You 'll be okay . What happened ?

[ Audrey Crying ] [ Telephone Rings ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Hello ? David . : I Wasn 't injured in that car accident . David . David . : I 've never been injured , Eliijah . What am I Supposed to do ? Go to where people are . Eliijah . : You Won 't have to look very long . It 's all right to be afraid , David , because this part Won 't be like a comic book . Real life doesn 't fit into little boxes that Were drawn for it . [ P.A. Announcer Speaking Indistinctly ] [ People Chattering ] There 's one in the first row . it 's--it 's the second one . Yes. it 's the second one over . Oh ! Go back to Africa ! [ Tyres Squeal ] Man . : Whoo-hoo ! Hey , what 's your name ? [ Music Playing Faintly ] I think you drank too much . Can I come in ? Who are you ? I like your house . Can I come in ? What is this ? No . You can 't come in . Are you sure ? What--What are you- - Man . : Aah ! [ Object Clatters ] [ Flips Light Switch ] Man . : Aah ! [ TV Playing Faintly ] [ Heart beats ] [ Object Clatters ] [ Child Gasps ] [ Children Whimpering ] It 's okay . [ Children Crying ] it 's okay . it 's okay . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh . [ Raining Outside ] [ Thunder ] [ Gags ] Oh ! Blaah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Aah ! Ahh ! Ahh ! [ Grunting ] I had a bad dream . it 's over now . David . : I don 't know . I can 't believe you 'd think that . I 'm just asking you . I 'm making French toast . Audrey . : I 've been thinking about Eliijah Price . If he shows up again , I think We should call the police , okay ? Okay ? Okay . [ Whispering ] You were right . [ Classical Piano Music Playing ] This is one of Johann Davis' earliest drawings . See the villain 's eyes ? They 're larger than the other characters ' . They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective on how they see the world- - Just off normal . He doesn 't look scary . Mm-hmm . That 's what I said to my son , but he says there 's always 2 kinds . There 's the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there 's the real threat- - the brilliant and evil archenemy who fights the hero with his mind . Are you Elijah 's mother ? I am . I 'm helping him with the sale . Nice to meet you . I 'm David Dunn . He 's spoken of you . Says you 're becoming friends . We are . Looks like he 's doing good today . I 'm very proud of him . He 's come through a lot in his life- - a couple of bad spells I thought had broken him . Mm-hmm . They were bad ... but he made it . Yes , he did . He 's kind of a miracle . Yes , he is . I 'll tell him you 're here . Thank you . it has begun . Tell me something , David . When you woke up this morning , was it still there ? The sadness ? David . : No . I think this is where we shake hands . [ Explosion ] [ Crowd Yells ] Woman . : Did you see it ? [ Siren ] [ Alarm Buzzes ] I worked in that building 25 years . I know all its secrets . Secrets ? Like if there ever was a fire on floors 1 , 2 , or 3 , everyone in that hotel would be burned alive . [ Siren ] Passengers aren 't allowed in there . [ People Scream ] Eliijah . : Do you know What the scariest thing is ? To not know your place in this world , to not know why you 're here . That 's ... That 's just an awful feeling . What have you done ? I almost gave up hope . Eliijah . : There Were so many times I questioned myself . You killed all those people . But I found you . So many sacrifices ... Just to find you . jésus Christ . Now that we know who you are ... I know who I am . I 'm not a mistake . Eliijah . : It all makes sense . In a comic , you know how you can tell who the arch-villain 's going to be ? He 's the exact opposite Of the hero , and most times , they 're friends , like you and me . I should 've known way back when . You know why , David ? Because of the kids . They called me Mr Glass .

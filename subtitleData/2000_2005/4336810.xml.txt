 Futurama [ 3x04 ] - Parasites Lost - CiWaN Breaker , breaker , this is the Duck . You wanna back off them hogs ? Ten-Four . Five miles or so . Ten , roger . I 'd better check the fluid levels . We 're okay on Coke syrup . Oh , man , come on ! Coming through ! What 's that black cracker ? A tomato . You 're eating a sandwich from a men 's room ? What 's the worst thing that could happen ? Ugh , it 's like a party in my mouth , and everyone 's throwing up . Look . One of them things like on our mud flaps . Yosemite Sam ? I 'm gonna put my moves on her . Jerk ! No one hoots at my captain unless they wanna go to the next level . Fry , I 'd rather not dignify them with an ass-Whipping . Yo , sexy mama , let 's get busy and freaky , in that order . How would you like it if Leela said she wanted to make love with you ? I got five minutes . She looks pretty good for a truck-Stop chick . You take that back ! She does not look good for a truck-Stop chick ! You 're right , she don 't got enough meat for me . She does too ! She 's got more meat than a cow . Ow ! Meat than a cow ! I can 't please Leela no matter what I do . I just want her to like me . Well , there 's always hope . We gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler . Who are you ? Scruffy . A janitor . Why aren 't you fixing the boiler ? Schedule conflict . There , fixed forever . Oh ! Scruffy 's gonna die the way he lived . Oh , marmalade . Oh , the hypochondriac 's back . What is it this time ? My lead pipe hurts a little . That 's normal . Next . Hm . He 's a witch ! Did you eat anything unusual recently ? No . What about that bathroom egg salad ? I 've had better . Egg salad ? Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract . Come , everyone . Give Fry some privacy . If you can 't see well enough , there 'll be a close-Up on this video screen . We 'll need to have a look inside you with this camera . Guess again . Gross ! Go , man , go . Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry 's bowel . It 's gorgeous . That place used to be a dump . Eww ! Worms ? Puke-A-Tronic ! So the eggs in that sandwich were ... ? Correct ! Worm eggs . And the mayonnaise wasn 't too fresh either . It 's nauseating , man . Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots ? Only one . We 'll have to travel deep inside Fry ... In this ! Shotgun ! Shotgun ! Aw . In each survival kit is a rain slicker , a disposable camera ... And something to protect you against bacteria : A harpoon . Yo , old guy . Why do we have to use micro-droids ? Can 't you just shrink us ? No . That would require extremely tiny atoms . Have you priced those lately ? I 'm not made of money . Leave me alone ! Me next ! Your net suits will let you experience Fry 's worm-infested bowels ... As if you were actually wriggling through them . There 's no part of that sentence I didn 't like . Is everyone present ? Definitely . Here 's the plan . We enter the ear , drip down the back of the throat And make for the bowel . There , we 'll irritate the splenic ganglion And cause a spasm , expelling , among other things , the parasites . I 'll tell Fry to wash out his ear . No ! Fry can 't know about the mission . If he finds out , the worms will defend themselves . They know everything he knows . Like how to make ice-cream soup ? Leela ! Your role is to distract Fry . Can do ! Leela , you should really try a facial scrub for your pores . Look , a starling ! Really ? Shh , be very quiet . We 're in the ear . Okay , professor . What ? What about what ? What if we go for a walk , possibly , because it 's such a lovely day ? I 'd love to . Let 's go where he won 't put his finger . It 's hopeless ! Wait ! We just have to get past the eardrum . What are they doing to his brain ? Giving it a tune-up . A quick glance suggests they 've doubled his thinking power . My God ! Soon he 'll be smarter than Cher ! Ah , the scent of a rose . Curious how aromatic hydrocarbons ... Can evoke deep emotions . For you . That 's a beautiful thought . And you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me . Brace yourselves . We 're entering the interior of Fry 's nose . We 're at finger-Alert five ! Let 's just pray nothing stimulates his smell receptors . Nobody make a smell . Quick ! We can escape through that capillary into the sinus . Usually you don 't know a thing about human anatomy . I learned it from a decongestant commercial : " Soothing action ... " Where are we , the ass ? The heart . Better known as the love muscle . Which digests food . We should be safe so long as nothing makes it beat faster . Abandon ship ! No ! Set course for that cholesterol-Encrusted valve . It 's good cholesterol , but it spreads like bad cholesterol . They 're Jazzercising Fry 's muscles . He 'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined . Gum-Ercules ? ! I love that guy . It 's that jerk from the truck stop . Let 's go blend in with those pimps . I don 't think so . Sir , you owe this lady an apology . Fry , no ! He 's bulging with what could be muscles . Ooh . I got your apologies right here . Ooh . Sorry , ma 'am . I 've learned a lesson about not ogling cans I won 't forget . Ah , the stomach . Scenic gateway to the bowel . Abandon ship ! No . Don 't give up now . We 're close to the pyloric sphincter . Hooray ! We made it ! There it is , the stately capitol of Fry 's bowel . A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the splenic ganglion . I 've heard of that . If we can stimulate it , the bowel will convulse , expelling the worms . But what about the worms in other areas ? This is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement . He 'll be lucky to have bones left . All right , let 's mush some worms ! Worms to battle stations ! I had a great time . The flowers , the puddle , the way you hurt that guy . But can I axe you something ? Anything . Why did you do all that stuff ? Oh . There 's something I 've wanted to tell you . But when I try , my mouth feels like it 's stuffed with peanut butter . Is it about Bender ? No , it 's about you and me . And Bender ? Bender 's not involved . Leela I love you . You do ? But only recently have I been able to articulate my thoughts . I love you , Leela , and I always have . Fry , that 's the sweetest , most wonderful ... Wait ! Recently ? Like since you ate that sandwich ? Yeah . I don 't know why , but my life really turned around that day . Stay here . Freshen your naugateena ? Please , I need something to settle my stomach . The nerve is through here . Where 's Zoidberg ? You 'll never guess where I 've been . One ! Two ! Three ! There it is . The pelvic splenic ganglion . Tickle it , then get ready for the ride of your lives . Don 't even think about it . Leela ! You 're in time to help . If we don 't get rid of the worms now , they 'll burrow so deep ... Not even Hermes ' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them . I call it Caribbean Drano . Fry will be stuck with worms forever . Perfect . Ouch ! I 'm okay . Leela , you ignorant dope ! Now the worms will be in Fry forever . So ? Maybe Fry is better off with worms . Oh , that 's stupid . If anyone wants to tell me what 's going on , I 'll be in the lounge . Of all the parasites I 've had , these worms are among ... They are the best ! How can I repay you for saving them ? I 'll think of something . Hello , what 's all this , then ? Apartment 1 I. The old me would joke about that . It 's a little underfurnished . I 'm thinking of having a window installed . The view 's perfect already . That 's the corniest thing I 've ever heard . Let me show you the bedroom . Wait . In a minute . A holophonor ? Only a few people can play that , and they 're not very good . They don 't have you to inspire them . I don 't have words to say how wonderful you are . I haven 't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday . With you , every day is like double-soup Tuesday . Oh , Fry , I love what you 've become . What I 've become ... What is it ? There 's something I have to find out . Who controls this bowel ? Who wants to know ? I am the lord mayor of Cologne ! You mean colon ? State your business . Have you ever been in love ? I thought I was once . But then I remembered we reproduce with spore clouds . A wonderful girl loves me , but I need to know if it 's me she loves ... Or just what you worms have made of me . So ... I 'm asking you to leave . Listen , you ! I was born here . I raised a cloud of children here . My ancestors came here on the sandwich . No one can make me leave ! Get out or the brain gets it ! He 's bluffing ! He wouldn 't willingly make himself an idiot . Obviously you 've never been in love . Now , the hand-eye coordination lobe . You 've damaged your brain ... But no more than a few drinks or five minutes on a cell phone . I was working my way toward the control center of the heart and lungs . If I kill myself , you die with me . Wait a minute , man . I hope Satan has a nice colon because that 's where you 're going . Stop ! We 'll leave . But one day you 'll be eating a fast-Food burger ... And boom ! You 'll be crawling with us again . Ever wonder what makes " special sauce " so special ? Yo . Fry ? I missed you . Did you find out what you needed to find out ? I 'm about to . Let me play for you . You don 't have to . I 'm still seduced from before . Please . It 's important to me . What does that mean ? I don 't know . I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts . Wow , did you see that vase break ? It was all like : Pkow ! What 's happened to you ? I got rid of the worms . What ? Why would you do that ? I needed to know who you loved ... Me or them . Well , which of you wrote that sonnet ? I did ! I think . It was probably 50-50 . But that 's how I really felt , I swear . I don 't know . Let me try to be romantic on my own . I 've got massage oil . I 'll give you a back rub just like I used to give Amy . She always seemed to ... Uh-Oh . Sorry you struck out . If it 's any consolation , my life is great . Babes , bucks , I got it all . Well , at least I learned Leela 's a lost cause . I give up . There you go ! Good night . I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars .

 Previously on Farscape Distillate of Laka . One whiff ... and the pain is gone . She says they help you forget Aeryn . When I double the dose . What do you desire with wormholes ? For starters ... go home . That 's earth . Your place of origin is where you can do the most damage . Crichton 's DNA , which I provided for you , will enable you to detect his presence . So when he returns , as we know he will , capture him alive . Pilot , I 've got Crichton . We 're coming aboard . Welcome home , son . We 've been waitin for ya a long time . What 's the matter John ? Was it a bass ... or a trout ? And now , on Farscape ... They 're not imposters . DRD scans confirm they are of your species . It 's me , son . It 's all right . You 're home . You 're alive . And , if that wasn 't miracle enough , this ship is actually a living organism ? Yes . She is . And her ... another alien life-form . How 'd you get up here ? We sent a shuttle . To open up communications . Everyone at IASA had a coronary when she answered ... finally . In English . She 's too smart . Commander Crichton . I am T.R. Holt , Special Advisor to the President . Congratulations . You have accomplished something truly momentous ... Earth 's first contact with extraterrestrial life . Well ... T.R. Today 's your lucky day . D 'Argo ! Aeryn ! Just don 't make any sudden moves . Good God ! What delayed you ? Moya arrived forty-two of their days ago . The wormhole 's unstable . Some time dilation may have occurred . Where the hell is Scorpius ? He 's in a pod at the far end of this wormhole . He 's transmitting us a signal so we can find our way back . - Yah , you can stop pimping for him anytime . - What is wrong with you ? These are your people . - Or do you think they pose us a threat ? - No . It 's the other way around . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 " Terra Firma " Earth ... Terra Firma . Seems forever it 's filled my thoughts , been my goal . And now ... I 'm here . Family ... friends ... seeing them again is so ... - so normal . - John ! You 're alive ! DK ! When did that happen ? A few years ago . Married on a boat in Naples . I wish you could 'a been there . - You said he was a geek . - He is a geek . - I won her over . I figured Earth would freak out and it 's delivered in spades , on time , thirty minutes or less . Uncle Sam is keeping the aliens safe and contained . A waterfront mansion for their personal use , with full security team standing by . It 's a cage , but at least it 's a gilded one . Good ? Of course , the suits are more interested in the technology . No surprise there . So ... we let ' em look . I don 't usually recommend this setting . They just can 't comprehend what they 're looking at ... much less replicate it . Be careful . Not yet . So , let ' em look . Some of the FIPs have accepted translator microbes ... .. ashtenta doit ... ashtenta doit ... under strict supervision . No power ups unless I ... But even translator microbes aren 't gonna to help some people listen . Not that ... you can blame them . Orshi Dort ! At least the alien life 's not going too crazy . My family has been helpin out . Would you like me to bring you some of my clothes ? My sister , Olivia ... she 's hangin with ' em . Sure . Thanks . And my cousin Bobby ... Bobby is totally fascinated by the ETs . Hey ! I got this great idea . How bout ... how bout we break outta here ... and go make some new friends ? Chiana , you know the humans will not let us out unescorted . And the way you make friends , I do not blame them . - Rygel , have you tried this ? - Sparky and Wrinkles ... - Another delicacy ? - They 're the happiest of the crew . - They 're in gastro heaven . - What 's it called ? It 's called ... cop porn . But T.R. Holt ... he is not happy . What 's the big deal ? It 's a simple proposal . A trip on a spaceship for five hundred of Earth 's best and brightest . Yah , but who picks the five hundred ? You ? Me ? No , no , no , no . Let UNESCO handle that or the Nobel Committee . Be much simpler to keep it local . Local meaning ... only red-blooded Americans . No deal . No cookie . Some would disagree ... quote ' the Farscape project was and is an American initiative . I do not think it is unfair that America shoud reap the first benefits of it . Yah ? What big-hearted patriot said that ? A former astronaut by the name of Jack Crichton . Did you know we 're making him IASA 's Project Director for Extraterrestrial Studies ? Father and Son . Dynamite P.R. Jack is just so happy to be making a contribution . Don 't screw it up for him . That 's a nice suit . Do you have to buy that or does it come standard issue ? Which brings us to Dad . Dad ... Okay , time for a lighting test . T-minus five and ... Dad 's world was upside down , so he 's trying to make it right side up by putting up Christmas decorations . Great ! Christmas decorations ... even though it 's Florida and the whole block is cordoned off with security . Please ! Back , Sir . It 's lookin good . Family traditions ... They 're supposed to bring us together ... and to make everything ... - normal . - So ... you do this every cycle ? Year . Every year . Year . Year . Christmas has always been our favorite holiday . We never get tired of it . I loved that Christmas where you lit the fireplace and the smoke came back down because Mr. Jingles was in the flue ! Oh , come on . One little mistake , you 're going to hold it against me . - The cat didn 't have hair for three months , Dad . - What the frell is that ? Remember the time we gave you the riding lessons , honey ? - Thought you were going to cry . - I did cry . - A cat ? - Yah . It 's a pet . - Hey , and this . Does he talk ? - Baby , remember this that your brother made ? - Yah . Show him . - Remember this , John ? - Yah . Made this when you were five years old . Your Mother loved it . So , what 's next ? We break out the bare-ass baby pictures ? - Hey , that 's not a bad idea . - Yah . Let 's take a vote . Aeryn ? - Let me get the photo album . - Of course ! - No . We 're not gonna ... you 're not lookin at my bare ass . - Why not ? I 've seen it already . Yes , we are ! Excuse me . I hear the door . I got it . Here . Let me show you this . Special delivery from the Ghost of Christmas Past . Caroline . Welcome back to Terra Firma . Hey ... um ... Caroline 's here . Come on in . But things have changed . And we don 't get to close our eyes and pretend they haven 't . And everyone is telling me ... how different I am . They 're right . But they don 't have a clue why . They can 't know ... what I 've seen ... what I 've done ... what 's been done to me . They can 't know what 's out there waiting for them and I can 't tell them , because they wouldn 't believe me . Hell , if I tried , they 'd lock me up . Frell . I 'd lock me up . Hey , Buck Rogers . You 're supposed to be fishing , not writing memoirs . What 's that ? It 's homework . This was supposed to be a weekend off . No homework , no stress , no aliens , no demands . I guess I 'm not doing my job . Mankind has always seen himself as the center of the Universe . To discover that 's no longer true is highly traumatic . A fundamental status quo is being threatened here . The very existence of Homo Sapiens may be under threat . It 's hardly surprising the hysteria 's rising . Hysteria ? In what sense ? - The presence of these alien creatures ... - No thanks . ... has induced various forms of societal hysteria ... Holt says it 's bad on the political front . Every nation 's demanding equal access to the aliens and - all the information we get from them . - Of course they are . - We 're going to give it to ' em . - I don 't see why . Why should we give them access to technology they can use against us ? Cause it 's the right thing to do . Wouldn 't worry about it , Dad . Subcommittee 'll tie it up for years and load it down with a ton of guidelines . Now you 're being naive , Son . The best and safest thing to do is keep it to ourselves . Space travel was your dream to unite mankind . When did that change ? September the eleventh . This isn 't the same world you left four years ago son . People don 't dream like they used to . It 's about survival now . Who 's survival ? Olivia 's survival . And Susan and Frank and Bobby 's . Imagine them blown up by a suicide bomb or coughing up blood from a poison gas attack . This country is under siege . You just don 't understand the global situation . I don 't understand because I 've been out of town or because Daddy knows best ? Aw , come on . Now that 's not fair , son . If you want to argue with Holt ... - or even the President , I can arrange that . - I don 't want to argue with anybody . No , you don 't want to argue , you just want to be obstinate and insist everyone agree with you . - Are you accusing me of being the only one in this family to be stubborn ? - No ! You 're the most stubborn . - That I would argue with . - Alright , let 's split the title . I am going ... into space tomorrow . If you 'd like to come along , you 're welcome ... unless you 're too stubborn . Awesome ! Yah , and this is just the garage . - Come on . Show me more . - No , I got some stuff I 've gotta do first . 1812 ! I 'll give him the tour , son . I know my way around . No , Jack . It 's a big ship . You 're going to need a sherpa . Gimme that arm . This should fix it up . It 's a miracle . 1812 , this is Bobby . Bobby , this is 1812 . 1812 is going to be your tour guide . - Don 't let him break anything . - I won 't break anything . Where 's that pilot you told me about ? I 'll show you . You won 't believe it . Jack ! That way . You think they know how to open doors ? Can you check wormhole stability from Command or do you need to go outside again ? No , Command will be fine . I 've had enough EVA to last a lifetime . Apparently all systems check out normal with the prowler so the scientists don 't seem to have caused any damage . I made sure they didn 't . I appreciate it . Thank you . Okay ... Meet you on Command . Thank you . Aeryn ... Listen up . You got a problem with them poking around at your prowler , why don 't you leave it here ? The IASA boys got enough to look at with D 'Argo 's guppy and my module . Would it be better if I stayed here as well ? Why would you want to do that ? I 'm clearly not fitting in . You 're fitting in as well as any of us . Whatever , it 's ... up to you . - It 's up to me ? - Yah . Yah , it 's up to you . Fine , I ... well , I don 't mind your scientists poking around with my prowler . I can even ... - field-strip a cannon if ... - No ... don 't do that . Thank you ... but don 't do that . They 've seen enough . - You want a hand ? - No . No . No , of course you don 't . What is that ? An explanation would be pointless . You 'd retain no memory of it . Skreeth ... can you hear me ? It 's Grayza . Report . I hear you . Crichton is onboard Moya . According to reports , Moya now orbits Crichton 's home planet . Where is this planet ? Unknown . We traveled through a wormhole to reach it . A wormhole ? Yes . Are you certain ? Yes . Do not seize Crichton yet . Learn all you can about his planet , its technology , its defenses and its location . Allowing me to interrogate Crichton will yield quicker answers . Crichton has already proved himself to be immune to several forms of interrogation . Stay hidden ... until we know more . Understood ? Understood . We took a short break ... for recreation . I see . Don 't you remember , Captain ? Perhaps you will ... next time . But duty first . Run a full weapons systems check immediately . I want this ship ready to destroy a planet . The readings match my homework . It 's gonna be at least seventy arns before the wormhole 's stable enough for Moya to get back through . Pilot says he and Moya are looking forward to giving humans their first trip to the stars . Yah , right . They 're not going , are they ? No . We 'll be long gone while they 're still bickering over who gets the tickets . Well , then why offer them in the first place ? To give them something . Otherwise , they 'll try and take it . Yah , but we 're not giving them anything . Their scientists can 't even work out how to use pulse pistols . Doesn 't matter . My planet doesn 't have chakkan oil anyway . Don 't look at me like that . You know how paranoid my planet is . Yah they ... they don 't like aliens . They don 't like anybody . I 'm glad to see you taking a positive approach . Cooperation , teamwork , distraction . We give ' em a few hints , then we get the hell outta Dodge and hope they get their act together before the real space monsters show up . Aeryn ? Have you seen John ? Pilot says he 's ready to head back down . So am I. Would you like a lift in my prowler ? Go for it , Jack . She 's the best pilot I 've ever seen . Think you can manage a side trip to the moon ? I think I can do better than that . Saturn ! I 'm really lookin at Saturn . I 'm farther from earth than any human 's ever been . Actually ... no . Oh , yah . I guess my son does have a few miles on me . He must be happy to be back on earth though . I don 't know . He 's having a tough time readjusting . He , uh ... hasn 't talked much about what he 's been through . Not even about his shipmates ? Naw , he ... he 's ... he 's talked about your societies , customs . Remarkable stuff . He thinks that your species and mine might somehow be linked . Our geneticists are still lookin at that ... but I wouldn 't be surprised . If I didn 't know better , I 'd think you were human . I 'm not . Do you wish you were ? Why do you ask ? You have feelings for John , don 't you ? Does that shock you ? No . I suppose it might if I thought of you as an alien life-form , but I don 't . John has not said anything to me , but I believe he has feelings for you too . He did . - Now ... - Now he 's home . That 's one of the things he 's gonna have to sort out . Just give him time . Biologic examination ? I said no . And , I don 't care how many of the others have consented . You can go stick your probes in one of them ... I 'm not interested . Well , you never know . - You might like it . - No , I will not have and ex ray . I don 't care how much it advances man 's xenobiological knowledge . N ... leave ! - Eat something . You 'll feel better . - I do not want to eat . I want to go back to Moya . - Good . Here ... here , give this to Pilot . Hark ! The hee rawld angles seenga . Glow ry to the nude blowed keen guh . Peach on erp and murky milld eh , gode and singers rek and sill ed . It was incredible ! We flew through the Cassini Division . Beat the Cassini space probe by a year . Told Aeryn it was the best Christmas present I 'd ever gotten . Except ... for that tie-rack you made me in Junior High School . Speaking of ... suits and ties , Holt is still fighting me on ... the tech-sharing plan and the explorer selection process . I could use a little support . I 've always supported you as much as I could , son . You 're not lookin at the bigger picture here . You don 't see the big picture . You can 't conceive of it . - Earth has to work together on this . - Yah ? Well , you 're asking the impossible on that one . Impossible . Impossible is not in our vocabulary . Who said that ? You . You did . Four days before you set foot on the moon . You taught me to believe that . That belief kept me alive . Please tell me you still believe it . I 'm not sure what I believe anymore . All this crap you 've tacked on ! Hetch drive . - FTL . - It can 't work . - It 's theoretically impossible . - Theory is wrong . Newton , Einstein , Hawking ... - we prove them wrong every time we pop out for groceries . - Then tell us how it works . I didn 't design it , DK . I just installed it . That 's for you to figure out . Sure , drop it in our laps . Let us scratch our heads and look stupid while you go on Nightline or have lunch with the President . We need some help ... we 're neanderthals trying to understand 747s . These new laptops are really ... nice . Laura , I can not tell you what I don 't know . Then why 'd you bring us these ships ? If we 're never going to learn anything , why rub our noses in how dumb we are ? - You 're not dumb . - Neither are you . Taka says you asked for a metallurgic analysis of these ships . You 're on the track of something . It 's just a riddle . Why do prowler pilots turn to goo ? Get back to me on that . I 'm gonna to get a refill of coffee . You guys want some ? Something 's going on . I 'm sure John is holding out on us . Probably trying to grab more of the glory for himself . Again ? He doesn 't care about it . The only thing John cares ... Laura ! Are you sure that they 're telling you the truth ? I can guarantee it . Plainly , not all humans have Crichton 's alleged ability to resist interrogation . Then Crichton has given no wormhole information to Earth yet . No . That knowledge can die with Crichton . Not until I have that knowledge . I 'm confident I can capture him ... but doubt I can bring him to you . Nor can I yet come to you . Wherever this Earth is , the journey there is obviously impractical without wormhole travel . And only Crichton can command that . Then our best alternative ... is to seize him , learn what we can from him , then execute him . I 'm forced to agree . Anything more you need from the captives ? No . Hey ! Where you been ? Shopping with aliens . They closed off the whole mall and the store owners , I 'm sure , were very annoyed . I 'm sure they love it . It 'll be in all their ads tomorrow ... not to mention something to tell their grandkids . - What 're you doin ? - Mmm , nothin . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Do you want to go live in the past ? No , thank you . I 've been there . Well , where do you want to live ? I don 't know . You tell me . Where do I belong ? Well , do you miss this life ? I look at these pictures and I recognize the faces ... some of the places ... but it 's not my life . I miss her . I miss that chick . I miss him , but I can 't ... he 's changed . What ? He 's changed so much that you can 't talk to him ? You know , he says exactly the same thing about you . " He 's changed so much and I can 't ... " I have changed ... and I can 't tell him why . Why not ? Because he 's ... the Director for Extraterrestrial Studies and what he hears , the government hears . You 're saying he can 't keep a confidence ? Coming here was a mistake . It was an accident . And it shouldn 't have happened . And there are things that ... the government cannot hear . What ? Is it bad ? No . No , no , no it 's not bad . Don 't worry . It 'll be okay . - Okay . - Trust me . So I see we 've been shopping again . Yes . Crichton isn 't here , is he ? No , but , uh , his cousin is . - He 's outside interviewing Caroline Wallace . - Really ? Thanks , Chi . - Can you help with this ? - No . - What 'd you do , buy the whole planet ? - It 's not mine . It 's from Aeryn . I don 't know what it is , but I ... I know it 's for Crichton . Won 't get him back . - He hasn 't forgiven her . - Oh , he will ... sooner or later . Some males ... can actually forgive . Ohh ! Sorry . So , how long have you known John Crichton ? I met him ... six years ago . And how long have you been his girlfriend ? Bobby , cut . Take five . Don 't stop . I 'm interested in the answer . Wanta tell me why you want to know ? That 's fair . John and I were in a relationship . What kind of relationship ? It was complicated . Yah . I can imagine . Well , actually , no . I can 't imagine . John and I had a much simpler one . No strings , no grand plans , just good , casual times . Well , at least , that 's how it was before . And now ? Uh ... he doesn 't even want that much . But he 's been spending time with you . I think he 's been testing himself . Working out what he really wants . It 's not me . I 'm sorry . No you 're not . You still want him , don 't you ? Yes . But it doesn 't matter . He doesn 't want me either . I think he does . When I asked him about you , he said ... there was nothing going on . He said that several times . That 's bad . You have a lot to understand about humans . Sometimes when we repeat a lie , it means that we 're trying to convince ourselves of the truth . And that is that he still loves you ... very much . Your head is bruised . How difficult was your travel here ? Extremely turbulent , but not very damaging . Following your guidance signal was a great help . What are you doing ? Cross-coupling the fuel cells . To turn this pod into a bomb . This wormhole is traversable . It leads to Crichton . Therefore , I cannot have Grayza find it . You think her Command Carrier will return ? My spy aboard the carrier has been unable to discern her current strategies . But , should she return ... as a last resort , I will detonate this pod ... within the mouth of the wormhole . That should destablize it . But how will you survive ? I wouldn 't survive it . You ... would have a better chance of destabilization with ... two ... pods . Would you like to observe the sequence ? I just spoke to Pilot . - Sikozu went back through the wormhole . - She did what ? She met up with Scorpius . That son-of-a-bitch . The wormhole must be stabilizing . She better not bring that bastard back through . - No . She says she 's not gonna return to Earth . - Good . No comms . There should be no signals that link back to us . I will inform the President . Now , I am getting major flak from the Hill about John 's Global Initiatives . He 's gotta bend a little . I don 't think he will . Make him . It 's your job . The Joint Chiefs are up in arms . They want to classify the alien technology as a ... a national security risk and impound it . John won 't permit that . He 'll take these ships outta here first . Look , I know you share my concerns about John 's plans . All I 'm asking for is a little compromise . Is that unreasonable . ? Crichton ... This isn 't a very fun party . It 's not supposed to be a party . It 's a photo-op for VIPs . Smile . Can 't we find a real party somewhere ? Could I have everybody 's attention ? Boy , here comes the ' my fellow Americans ' . I once told my son he 'd ... he 'd get the chance to become his own kind of hero . Well , he got it . And he made the most of it . I also taught him to stick to his guns when he thought he was right . So , I can 't fault him when he does . I 've heard it said ... that he should accept our judgment over his ... because he ... owes us . I 've even said it myself . We 're wrong . Look at the friends he discovered ... the miracles he brought ... and then ask yourself ... what he owes us as compared to what we owe him . Now , John insists that we share these wonders with the rest of the world . But some people are afraid of what 'll happen if we do . John 's afraid of what 'll happen if we don 't , and I 'll go with that . So , as ... IASA 's Project Director for Extraterrestrial Studies , I hereby invite all nations ... to participate in the ongoing Farscape mission . What made you change your mind ? Cause I believe in you . That means a lot . There 's a few things we should talk about . Son , it 's Christmas Ever . Right . It 'll keep . I know you 're preparing for a private dinner so I won 't stay long . Is he ... is John here yet ? Um , no . Not yet . I ... I wanted to bring you back the clothes you lent me . They didn 't suit you , huh ? Oh , no , it 's not that . It 's just ... I 'm more comfortable in these . It 's what I am , I guess . And I brought the books as well . I really appreciate it ... everything . Are you leaving ? Possibly . Well , you 'll be here tomorrow morning to open presents with the rest of us , won 't you ? I may not . What 's happened ? Nothing bad . It 's not bad . It 's just that I may be needed on Moy on Moya for a while . It 's all right . Ill be right back . So ... are you as bored as I am ? I 'm sorry , Senator . She 's , uh ... still learning our customs . Spank you very much . - Maybe you can teach me . - Okay , Chiana , let 's leave . - Come on . - What 's wrong with you guys ? What ? You all scared of us still ? Don 't you know that all humans are bigots ? They fight even amongst their own species . Well , they do seem to fight a lot amongst themselves . Hey maybe ... maybe that 's why they barely left their own planet . What ? Something smells bad . Well , it 's not me . Frell . Since you escorted us all the way to the living room , I insist that you stay for a cup of eggnog . Thank you , Sir . - Hi , Aeryn . - Hello . Livvy ? In here . I 'm sorry . I just have to drop some things off to Olivia . No , that 's alright . Do you want me to go back to Moya ? We 've already talked about this . It 's entirely up to you . Fine . I 'll go with what you prefer . Look , I 'm not trying ... to pressure you , John . I 'm actually trying to take the pressure off . Would you be happier ... if I wasn 't here on Earth ? You don 't have to justify it or explain it . Just give me an honest yes or no . Aeryn ? Would you join us for dinner ? Oh no , I c ... I couldn 't impose . There 's always room for one more . It 's a traditional family thing . We 'll start a new tradition . Look , it 's up to you , but we 'd love to have you . Could I get some eggnog , please ? Livvy ! - Suck on this ! - What is that ? Forget about it . - John ... Wynonna . - Right . - I 've got Crichton . - Yes ? John ... clear ! Where 's Dad ? Livvy ? Olivia . You all right , old man ? - Olivia . You all right ? - What the hell was that ? No idea . Get down ! What is it ? Tell me what 's wrong . Well ... Merry frelling Christmas . Amen . Ma 'am ! Captain , that was the best ever . You continue to amaze me . Uh , I 'm glad I could be of service . I mean , I 'm pleased I could satisfy ... Will that be all ? Yes ... For now . Uh ... all the food goes to my chamber . Well , what 're we doing with Crichton 's gifts ? You wanta put ' em in his quarters ? Not the right time . Cargo bay for now . We 'll leave as soon as Crichton 's aboard . - Here , I 'll give you a hand . - Thank you . Noranti what 's this ? Well , I think you made it . It 's for Crichton . What does it do ? What does it do ? It 's to help him move on . Surmount his feelings and forget . Who ? I was gonna give you this on Christmas . This is Mom 's . She left this to you . I want you to have it . Mom 'd love that . Don 't go . I have to go . You take care . Stay . Look , we 'll guard the wormhole . We 'll ... we 'll set up a defense shield . Nothin 'll get through . No , I have a job to do . It 's your words again . I don 't want to lose you , son . I can 't shake ... this feelin that you 're not comin back . Oh , I 'll be back . That 's a promise . You take care of my home . Take care of yourself . Subtitles : PK SUB-66

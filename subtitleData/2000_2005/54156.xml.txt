 Let 's see if we can get something out of these guys f or a change . - Warden . - Scott . So we were supposed to be operational three days ago . - We 're drilling into 12 , 000 feet of ice . - l know that was the plan . We 've had problems . Things aren 't on schedule . We 've been without heat three of the last six nights . - We 're working on it . - ls what it is . The problem is , we 're at 8200 feet , and we ran into a rock f ormation that- lt 's just not supposed to be there . - So drill through it . It 's not your typical rock f ormation . Seismics is showing us that it 's hollow . Hollow ? Then it should be easy . Right . So you gotta drill through a hollow rock . What 's the problem ? Goodman ? The warden wants to know why we don 't drill through the rock . You wanna explain why we don 't ? It 's hollow. lt 's hollow . I heard that . Why can 't we drill through it ? A high-pressure release can cause head-shearing detonation depending on the consistency of the gas within the structural f ormation . - lt 's a risk . - l 'm willing to take the risk . So go ahead and drill through it . I don 't think you understand the risks . I understand . Did you understand me ? I said drill through it . Make the call . All right , put it back online . Drill through it . I 've sat on my ass here f or over six months . - What is it ? - Pressure f rom inside the rock . - At least 5000 pounds per square inch . - Shit . - What ? What 's gonna happen ? - We got a lot of gas coming at us . - We 'll have an explosion . - You said nothing about blowing us up ! - l told you exactly- - - Next time , mention all the possibilities ! - What the hell ? - Five seconds to impact . - Chasm was pressurized ... - Jesus ! - ... with pure nitrogen . - ls there gonna be another explosion ? Pure nitrogen . I don 't know . This is strange . A rock at that depth it 's gotta be at least 10 million years old . Anything inside it probably hasn 't aged a day . - Because of the gas ? - Nitrogen is an inert gas . It 's used at the Smithsonian to seal old documents . - Yeah , I know . - So is there gonna be a problem ? It 's an important find . We should contact geologists . - You 're right . - l gotta get this prison running . Just get me some power . And make sure me and my boys get some heat . - l don 't trust these guys . - Could 've got us both killed . Let 's make sure there 's no more screwups . - The less we see of them , the better . - Yes , sir . The Antarctic is the last great f rontier of palaeontological studies . Twenty million years ago , this was a tropical f orest teeming with reptiles that could be f ound nowhere else at that time . Yes , Alexandra . Undiscovered reptiles is just a theory of yours . Correct , doctor ? I mean , it hasn 't been proven . Actually , it 's a theory that we both share . My wife , Dr. Jessica Platt Trenton . Hello . As you can see , I 'm not alone in this theory . The scientific community f rowns on it when the only person who supports your theories is your wife . We 've been granted a research grant to do some fieldwork by the university , and will no longer be teaching here . We wanted to thank you and say we 've enjoyed our time . We wish you luck with all of your f uture endeavours . - So thank you , and good luck . - Thank you . - Thanks , professor . - Thanks . I 'm gonna miss you , Dr. Trenton . Even though I may not agree with all of your theories . - Thank you . Thank you very much . - See you . She 's one of the more attractive palaeontology students I 've seen . If I remember , you were the prettiest palaeontology student I 've ever met . - Really ? - Really . Why do you think I married you ? Because I got a higher score on my GMAT than you . Well , there 's that too . That way I could study off your papers ... . You think it 's possible we 're making a big mistake ? - Walking out on tenure ? - Yeah . Probably . - So why are we doing it ? - Because-- - Why are we doing it ? - Because I wouldn 't f orgive you if you didn 't let me do some serious fieldwork . I know it 's important- - - And I 'm not ready to settle down yet . - l 'm not asking you to settle- - You are . Asking me to have a baby is asking me to settle down . Yuri . When the Russians learn of our purchase f rom the North Koreans they may take action . It 's not the Russians I worry about . It 's the Americans . Americans ? This does not concern them . They are medium-range missiles . Americans have taken on responsibility of being the policemen of the world . The Russians have their hands dirty long enough in our country . Now it 's the Americans ' turn . We have acquired target . Roger . We are waiting for authorization to proceed . Roger . What is it ? - Two planes trailing us . - Ask them to identify themselves . This is Gulf 3-0 . Will the planes at 10 miles at my 6 : 00 identify yourselves . This is Gulf 3-0 . Planes at my 6 : 00 , again , identify yourselves . They 're not responding . Target identified and attempted contact . Please advise . Roger , Tango 2-8 . Go to phase two . Roger . Proceeding to phase two . They 're closing in on us , sir . - What is it ? - Two planes closing in on us . Who are they ? I don 't know . The fighters are still closing . Sir , the fighters are still closing . Countermeasures ! Instruments are down . Electromagnetic pulse . Blew out all the electronics . Can you still fly ? I have no instruments . We 're totally blind . We have to land . - What do they want , sir ? - They want us to f ollow them . - Sir ? - What else can we do ? We f ollow them . Diego Garcia . Largest U.S. military base in Indian Ocean . What happened ? Where are we landing ? Diego Garcia . Probably our last stop . Welcome to the International Security Prison Facility . Presently , the temperature outside is 67 degrees below zero . We hope you enjoy your stay . How nice . Mr. Breshcov . I hope your flight here was pleasant . Mr. Breshcov . Mr. Breshcov . Mr. Breshcov . I hope your flight here was pleasant . - Who are you ? - l 'm the warden . I am defence minister of the sovereign country of Chechnya . By what right do you kidnap me ? You haven 't been kidnapped , sir . You have been arrested and sentenced to remain in this f acility f or the rest of your life . For what ? For purchasing two nuclear missiles which you were going to launch at the Russians . Not that it is any of your business but the purchase of these alleged missiles was to protect my country . The world couldn 't aff ord to find out if you 'd use them . We had to take preemptive action . I claim diplomatic immunity . I have rights ! You have no rights ! Sir , you are no longer a citizen of any country . You 're mine ! You have been tried and convicted by an international protective council . You 're now a member of an elite prison unit instituted by a 35-nation committee . - Warden-- - Shut up ! Where are we ? International Maximum Security Prison , the New Alcatraz . I know this . But where exactly are we ? Twenty kilometres north of the South Pole . Make yourself at home , Mr. Breshcov . Sergeant Quinn here . Okay . - Warden . - Yeah . You have a call f rom Puluso . Lucky me . Yeah , what is it ? I got a problem here . You gotta come down and see for yourself . Okay . I have never liked surprises . - lt 's gonna be another cold night . - Freezing . What the hell is this ? Well , it 's easier to explain if you see it . What the hell ? My God . It should take three jackhammers a week to break through this wall . I want an immediate prisoner count . Yes , sir . Sergeant Quinn here . I need a prisoner count ASAP . - Did you see anything ? - No . All right . Everyone present and accounted f or . Good . So , what the hell happened here ? We don 't know . Come on . Watch it. lt 's a little slippery . God ! How did this get here ? Puluso , how did this get here ? - We don 't know . - What do you mean , you don 't know ? We came up here this morning and it was just here . It was just here ? It would take a serious piece of machinery to drill a tunnel through this ice . Could be f rom a gas buildup . Gas buildup ? Come on . Give me some light here . Now what is this thing ? That 's the heat ex change pipe we use to tap into the geothermal source . Are you telling me you didn 't cut this tunnel to the heat ex change ? Gas could 've been detonated by the heat ex change blowing a hole through the ice and wall . You know , Goodman , that is- - l don 't know . Maybe you 're right . Puluso , what do you think happened here ? I hope Goodman 's right . You hope he 's right . What else could it be ? Nothing. I 'm sure Goodman 's right . Some kind of gas explosion . Right . Because I can tell you , it 's not penguins . How deep is this thing ? 12 , 230 feet . Really ? Relax , Goodman . I want you guys to get this wall sealed back up as soon as possible . If it 's gas , we should monitor it f or a few days first . You got two days . This hole is the only way out . I want guards here until they seal it up . Yes , sir . Do you think this was caused by gas ? I have no idea . Gas explosion . I hope you 're right , Goodman . Well , what else could it be ? I don 't know . What 's up ? Kelly Mitich . - Yuri Breshcov . - How you doing ? Peter Yuvol . Hey . So , what are you dudes in f or ? I guess you could say we are political prisoners . Cool . Sort of like Karl Marx or something ? Sort of . Yo , maybe you heard of me , Prince of Darkness . Twelve countries hired me to hack the U.S. government . One time I shut down f our defence networks in one day . Very good . I 'm sorry we did not have opportunity to utilize your services . Yeah , me too . So where are the rest of our fellow prisoners ? There 's only six of us. I hear they 're bringing 20 more a month . In six months it 'll be a goddamn rave , especially if they 're all as hot as her . I 'd have lesbian sex with your dead grandmother bef ore I 'd consider you . Isn 't she sweet ? Patricia O 'Boyle , Ira . She has a little thing f or me . I can tell . How are you doing ? As good as can be expected under the circumstances . I 'm sure you dudes know Jose 's work . The American Embassy in Buenos Aires . I think we heard something about this . And the quiet gentleman at the table behind us , Ben Shad . Iraqi . Chemical weapons builder . Nice . So let 's get serious . When we gonna bust out ? I know you 're thinking about it . You need someone f or the technical side of the operation. lt 's me . Systems analysis , overriding program systems. I 'm your guy . Bust out to where ? We 're in middle of South Pole . Couple tycoons like you can get an ops team in here to rattle this cage . Kelly . What ? Microphone . Fuck . Later . What- - ? What the hell ? I hear something in the tunnel . I want some backup . Did you hear that ? I need some backup . Jankins , there 's nothing there . Did you hear that ? I want some back . It 's probably the heat ex change . Check it out . You gotta be kidding . You want me to go inside ? Jankins , get in there and check it out . That 's an order . Goddamn it . Jankins is hearing something in the ice tunnel . He 's calling for backup . Why don 't you and Goodman go down and help him out . Aw , Jesus ... . Isn 't there anyone else available ? It 's your department . Right . Did you guys hear that ? Relax . I got Puluso and Goodman headed there . Great. I 'm feeling safer already . Just the heat ex change pipe . I told you . Why 'd you have me come in here ? I wanted to make sure . Want me to tell them to go back to bed ? Fuck them . They can come down here and f reeze their asses off with me . They 're gonna be pissed . So what ? - What was that ? - Say again. I can 't hear you . Say again ? Jankins ? Jankins , do you read me ? Jankins , do you read me ? Jankins , do you read me ? Jankins ? Quinn , where 's Jankins ? He was- - He was in the tunnel . Get him out here , will you ? I lost contact with him . Go into the tunnel and see what happened to him . I 'm not going in the tunnel . Why not ? It 's not our job to check out that tunnel . It 's part of engineering . Part of engineering ? That tunnel didn 't even exist two days ago . Goodman and I are engineers , not soldiers . Why don 't you send some guards down here and get Jankins yourself . They 're sleeping . Well , so were we , asshole . He wants us to go in that tunnel and get Jankins . Jankins is a bitch . - What ? - What ? Blood ? - Hey . - Hey . We got a letter f rom the university . They want us to talk to the department . Give them a call . It 's kind of serious . They want to review our grant . So they take our grant . We go back to teaching . - l don 't want to . - lt 'll be fine . - How do you know ? - l don 't . - Okay . - What ? What ? Just because we don 't want the same things at the same time it doesn 't mean I 'm not ever gonna want them . Do you have a timetable you 'd like to share ? I 'd love to be let in on the secret . Someday . Just not right now . - l 'm sorry . - Someday . Generally , when you meet someone , you get married and want kids . You want me to put my career on hold while you stomp around the world . You don 't have to do that . Do you think this is the ideal place to raise a child ? - You don 't have to stay here . - l 'd be at the motel with our baby . - lt 's not gonna work like that . - How 's it gonna work ? I don 't know . But we would figure it out . No , I would figure it out ! - Dr. and Mrs. Trenton ? - What ? I 'm sorry . Can we help you guys ? I would like to talk to you about a recent discovery in the Antarctic . - How old is this material ? - 72 hours . They were drilling and hit a rock f ormation that was pure nitrogen ? Yes , sir . They want us to go head the team ? Yes , ma 'am . - Count me in . - Wait . - Robert ! - Honey , please . Captain , why have my wife and I been given this honour ? There are 20 equally qualified palaeontologists you could 've gone to . You two published a thesis on undocumented Antarctic reptiles . We 're gonna find those here ? I don 't know. I was ordered to ask you to join the team . If you don 't want to , I 'll ask Dr. Keener of Berkeley . Come on . He is a hack . We can 't let this slip by . Can you ex cuse us f or one second , please ? What about our grant ? What about our commitment here ? This is a breakthrough . A nitrogen-filled chamber that 's 9000 feet under the ice . It 's a chance to see something that 's 20 million years old . It 's in pristine condition. lt 's gonna look like it was f ormed yesterday . You 're right . I know . So when do we leave ? You 're to be on a flight tonight . - Tonight ? Wait a minute . - Wait . Wait . Joshua ? You 're in charge . I guess that 's great . - Sit back here ? - Yes . - You all right , doctor ? - Fine , thank you . First time in the Antarctic ? My wife and I were here on a dig in the summer of ' 97 . Not bad in the summer . But this time of year ? Forget it . Months of solid night . What can you tell me about this place ? - You weren 't briefed ? - Barely had time to pack . The captain didn 't say a lot . We figured it 's a research or mining operation . Captain Thomas is a little light in the loafers when giving out inf ormation . Okay , can you be more specific ? I don 't get the joke . International high-security prison . They call it New Alcatraz . We 're going to a prison in the middle of the Antarctic ? International prison f or the worst of the worst . - Never heard of it . - You won 't . Remember that national security document you signed ? Yeah . That means you don 't talk about anything on this mission . We were hired to lead a research team down to a rock f ormation under the ice . Not this bullshit . I don 't know anything about any rock f ormation . I do know that you and your wife are supposed to be experts on Antarctic reptiles . We 're palaeontologists . We study f ossils . - Fossils ? - Right , f ossils . - Would you tell us what 's so f unny ? - How long you been awake ? Long enough to hear about the prison . What do you know that we don 't ? I got a report that there was some sort of snakelike creature running around in the prison . I was told it may have been hiding in this rock f ormation and somebody drilled through it . Alcatraz Approach , requesting vectors f or our PAR approach to runway in use . How do you hear me ? Alcatraz Approach , requesting vectors f or our PAR approach to runway in use . Do you hear ? And so you brought your soldiers here to catch the thing ? - lf the need arises . - So why are we here ? We deal with dead things , not live ones . You 're our pros f rom Dover . A lot of pros f rom Dover got killed dismantling bombs in World War ll . Take it easy , Dr. Trenton , Mrs. Trenton , we 'll take care of you . That 's Dr. Platt , major . Right . Prepare f or landing . I can barely see the wings . How can they land this thing ? Your guess is as good as mine , doctor . Great , thank you . Very helpf ul . Can 't see squat . Major . We ain 't got no approach lights , no beacon . I 'm gonna go see . - What 's the problem ? - Can 't see . We got no approach lights , no beacon . Do we have f uel to make it back to the coast ? Negative . Well , I don 't want to ditch this plane on some ice field . We have to put her down somewhere because we 're flying on f umes . I say we roll the dice and land the beast . I guess it 'll be anybody 's guess as to where the runway is . Good luck , captain . Here . Come here . Hang on . Jesus Christ ! Reverse throttles now ! Hold on ! - Teaching job 's looking good now . - All right , let 's get ready to move . - You okay ? - Yeah . Okay . After we ref uel this beast can 't be on the ground more than 12 hours . After that , y 'all better plan on taking the next transport . Why is that ? The fluids on this plane will be f rozen. I 'll be waiting f or it to thaw . When 's the next transport ? - 30 days . - 30 days ? Relax , doctor . We 'll get you on the plane . Twelve hours . The main access doors are about 150 yards . Make sure you keep the person in f ront of you in sight . You need a tracker to find the doors ? It 's August in the Antarctic . Are we lost ? The doors should be here ! Then let 's go back to the goddamn plane ! Good luck finding it . Now what 's the matter ? It 's dead . - How are we supposed to get inside ? - McCarthy , get up here . Override this thing . How big is this place ? When it 's f ully operational , 25 , 000 prisoners will be housed here . - How many are here now ? - l don 't know . - Where the hell is everybody ? - Inside . - Who else has a key to this place ? - l 'm it . What happens if something happens to you ? We 're locked in until somebody lets us out . Jesus ! What the hell happened here ? They were shooting at something . - Freeze , or we 'll fire ! - Fuck you . You f reeze . All right . Everybody take a deep breath and listen . Men , stand down . Stand down ! This is our rescue team . - We came to help . - Good . What the hell is going on ? - But you are ? - l 'm Dr. Robert Trenton . This is my wife , Dr. Jessica Platt Trenton . - What 's going on ? - l 'll tell you what 's going on . There 's some kind of oversized snake that 's killed- - eaten six people . I say we get on your plane ... - ... and fly f ar away f rom here . - Snake ? We came down here to take care of a problem . Not to evacuate it . Fuck that . We 're out of here . Let me make myself clear . No one 's going anywhere . I 'm the only one with an access key to get out . Quinn . Easy , gentlemen . Quinn. lt 's okay . Come on . Don 't do this . Stand down . Stand down . Gentlemen . Trust me , will you ? - ls someone going to brief me ? - l 'd be glad to . Major Larsten , Warden Ryan . I apologize f or my men . We 've been through hell . Two weeks ago there was a break in one of our walls . The next night , a guard and two engineers were killed . Washington told us to seal the lower part until you guys got here . Since then , this thing has broken our barriers and killed three more guards . Ex cuse me . This " thing " ? - This is a big , giant snake ? - Big ? That 's an understatement . Let me show you . We recorded this two nights ago . Holy shit ! That thing 's over 80 feet long . If it 's related to Serpuca Largas ... - ... it could be the missing link . - So you 're the experts ? I guess you could say that . - This is the layout map of the f acility ? - Yeah . - Show me the wall where the hole was . - Right here . - The heat ex change . - Yeah , exactly . If it 's a reptile , it looks f or the warmest place . And f ood . Do you realize this could be the most significant discovery in history ? - This is like a real-life Jurassic Park . - l saw Jurassic Park . - Everybody got killed . - Not everybody . This is not a movie . I got a prison to run here . Major , I want you to make me believe that you can hunt this thing down and actually kill it . Yes , sir . So the most logical place to find this snake is the heat ex change ? If that 's the warmest place , absolutely . All right . My men and I will head east down the access tunnel and we 're gonna divide . McCarthy and Simmons you go down west . We 'll drive the snake to the heat ex change and kill it . Okay , wait. ls there no way to capture this thing ? Would you give me a break ? This ain 't a game reserve . I got six people dead ! I want out of this place too , but we can 't abandon ship . You must understand the significance of this find . Doctor , when it 's dead , it 's all yours . Meanwhile , major , let 's put this operation in gear . Yes , sir . Let 's go ! - What is this place ? - Security control room . One man can watch the entire f acility . We 're moving down the east tunnel . Nothing so far . You 'll reach the divide in the tunnel in about 20 meters . McCarthy , Simmons , move down the west tunnel . Sir . We 're at the end. lt 's all clear . You guys should be at another intersection . McCarthy , left . Simmons , right . Sir , are you telling us to proceed by ourselves ? Damn it , McCarthy ! Keep moving ! All right . Let 's go . Sir , I think I hear something directly ahead of me . Make sure you have a target bef ore you fire . This place is loaded with exposed gas lines . Sir , I saw it. I just saw it . It 's headed down S-23 . Repeat . What access way ? - Repeat . What access way ? - Lost the target . - l 'm moving back . - Damn it , McCarthy ! Keep moving ! Keep moving . Damn it , McCarthy . Keep moving . - What 's on surveillance ? - l don 't see a thing . Work with me . You 've got to see something . There is nothing on the screen . All right , hold it . Warden , how many guards do you have ? - We have six . - All right . I need them to move east up the main corridor . - What the hell f or , major ? - l need help down here ! Just do as I say ! This thing has already killed three of my men . This isn 't my problem . If we want to get out alive , it 's a problem f or all of us . This is bullshit , Fred , and you know it ! They should have just evacuated us . They were sent to deal with this thing . My men are guards not big-game hunters . Mr. Quinn , my friend , you and I have been through a lot together . Now , I want you to get your men and go down there , understand ? This is a direct order . And what are you gonna do if I don 't ? I 'm gonna fire you . And replace me with who ? First real son of a bitch I can find . This is Sergeant Quinn . I need all guards to meet me at the access way to the lower south entrance . I 'm going with you . Welcome to the party . Doctor , you were sent here as an expert , not a soldier . I 'm not doing anything here . - Where are you going ? - With you . - No , you 're not . - This is really important to me . - Jessica , no . - l am going with you . Simmons , where are you ? Keep your eyes open . Major , it 's coming straight f or you . - How f ar ? - 100 meters and closing fast . Simmons , where are you ? Major , here it comes . You should open fire now . Open fire now ! - l would open fire now ! - l don 't see anything . You don 't see anything ? It 's in f ront of you ! Cease fire ! Cease fire ! Goddamn it . We 've got a man down . - What happened ? - He 's been shot . Major , wait f or Quinn and his men to get there . Shit ! Stop , stop , stop , stop ! What ? We should continue on f oot f rom here on out . What f or ? I 'm not walking with that snake on the loose . - l want to get in and out . - Snakes can 't hear . They don 't hear . They sense vibration . - These carts create vibration . - So what ? - He 's right . They attract it . - Come on . You gotta be kidding me . - l 'm serious . We shouldn 't use carts . - We 're not walking . Any of you wanna walk ? I didn 't think so . You may be the expert , doc , but no one 's walking . - Now , get back in the car . - No . No way . Enjoy the walk , asshole . Come on , you son of a bitch ! We got a major gas leak . Tell your men to pull back ! Quinn , you heard the major . Get back out of there . Quinn , did you hear that ? - Quinn ? - Major ! What was that ? Quinn ? Major ! Come in . Quinn , can you hear me ? Shit . Jesus Christ ! - Shit ! - What ? We gotta get out of here . The heat , the flames ! - Oh , my God ! - Unbelievable . - l have to document this . - Don 't do anything to aggravate it . It 's the greatest discovery in history . You don 't want a picture ? I just don 't want to die . Gonna run f or it on three . Ready , one , two three ! Go ! - l can 't ! - l 'll get it . Take my hand . Jessica ! Jessica ! Jessica ! Jessica ! - What are you doing ? - You 're alive . - My wife is dead . - What about Quinn ? The major ? - Everyone is dead . - Shit ! Where are the others ? - What others ? - Prisoners . - ln their cells . - Let 's get them . - What ? - Let 's get them . Let 's get them ? Why ? With their help , we escape . The plane leaves in under f our hours . We 'll leave , but we 're not taking prisoners . - They 're killers . - lt 's not a moral question . It 's simple f ucking math ! It 's simple mathematics . - Hold on ! - lt 's not a moral issue . It 's mathematics . With the prisoners help our chances of survival go up . Do you get that ? Do you get that ? That is if they don 't kill us first . Do you understand that ? All right , here they are . Do you know what 's going on with the loose snake ? We 're all stuck inside here right now . - We need your help to escape . - You need our help to escape ? That 's right . - l 'm not opening these cells . - l 'm not here f or a violent crime . - We can work out a deal . - Shut up . - Always the tough Irish whore , huh ? - lf we help ... - ... we go f ree ? - He doesn 't have power to grant that . He 's right. I don 't have that power , but I 'll tell you what . You got a better chance escaping once you 're outside than you do now . You have a deal . - Let them out . - What 's the point ? We 're all trapped in this prison . They know more about breaking out of prison than we do . Come on . Mr. Breshcov , I 'm going to ask you f or your word of honour ... - ... that if I do this thing- - - l give you my word . You will not be harmed . I want to make one thing perfectly clear right f rom the top- - I said , no one is to be harmed . - We need weapons . - No. I 'm not giving you weapon- - So now we need weapons . These weapons are live , so watch out- - Let 's go , guys . Come on . Move , move . Come on , boys . - You need a gun ? - No . Right up here . All right ! I say dynamite the outer wall , then dig . - The walls are 2 feet thick . - l can override the mainf rame . - Tell the access doors the power 's on . - The lock can 't be overridden . - No shit . - Nice idea , though . Wait . Snake breaks in through heat ex change . Ice tunnel intersects heat ex change pipe . We go through break in ice tunnel and climb out heat tunnel . Runs a few feet below the ice at the top . Small charge , blow through to surf ace . How do you know that ? Some of us were not considering spending rest of our lives here . Good idea , but there 's a flaw . The heat ex change room has two ways to get there the main access tunnel or through the chamber room . The snake 's been in both areas. lf it 's not in one , it 's in the heat ex change . - We divide in groups . - Then we cut power in half . This is not about power . The snake can 't be in two places at once . - Both groups have 50-50 chance . - lf it 's in the heat ex change ? Then we 're all dead . That too complicated f or you , you wild , Protestant whore ? Come on ! Come on , baby ! - We won 't get anywhere by fighting . - Then let me kill him . - We 'll have a truce . - No fights . I 'm the one in charge here . Don 't f orget . You were in charge until all your guards got whacked ! Want to take a vote on who 's in charge ? Any one of us could kill you with his bare hands . Good . Now , this is understood . Warden , Mitich , O 'Boyle , go with Dr. Trenton . - The rest come with me . - You 're sticking them together ? They 're trying to kill each other . They won 't kill you . - Hope you can shoot that gun . - What do you expect ? - l 'm not here f or killing anybody . - Worse . You shut down AOL . - What is it ? - Thought I heard something . Did you see something ? Come on . - We 're all clear . - So are we . Ben ! Where the hell did he go ? What do you mean , he 's gone ? He left ? Quit whining . Just shut your mouth . - Shut up , you Ira bitch . - l 've waited f or this since I laid eyes on you ! - Knock it off . - Not until I shoot the bastard ! I 've been waiting f or this since I laid eyes on you ! Mitich ! How you like them apples , Patty ? Knock it off ! Jesus Christ ! Get out of the car ! - Are you happy , doctor ? - What the hell 's wrong with you ? I told you , not until I shoot the little bastard . Goddamn it , Mitich ! I ref use to get killed down here in this hellhole , Mitich ! Let 's get out of here . Okay . Yuri , come in . Come in . Patty and I are the only ones left . - I repeat- - - Where are you ? Patty and I are the only ones left . - Everyone else- - - What happened ? We 're too f ar underground to get transmission . What is this place ? Blueprints I stole say it was used f or storage . Storage f or what ? Water , f uel , f ood . The only f ood I see in here now is us . Go ! Go . Go ! - Who are you ? - Jessica Platt ... . Your husband said you were killed .

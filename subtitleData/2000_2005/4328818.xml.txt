 Rock music 103-11 Mash . Oh , I don 't drink alcohol . Neither do I. It 's not alcohol . It 's H2-O mixed with soil from deep in the Earth . It 's a health drink . It fortifies you and cleans you out all at the same time . Here 's your Mash . - Mmmm ! - Ah ! Whooo ! Whoo . Really mild , huh ? Here 's mud in your eye . Urgh ! - What 's wrong ? - Check out the guy at the bar . - What about him ? - He 's a Betrayer . How do you know ? Bailies took him from my village when I was six . He should be 50 by now . He hasn 't changed a bit . Hel , don 't let her do anything rash . I don 't want her terminating somebody because they aged well . Hey , ladies , can I buy you some drinks ? Maybe we can have some fun . Yeah . - We can have some fun . Sarge , no ! - Is he human or robotic ? - I don 't know , Sarge . Do robots bleed ? Stay down ! Get out of there ! Go ! I 'm right behind you ! Hey. wait for me ! - Shields up ! Hel ! Watch out ! Let 's finish him ! Hel , are you all right ? Yeah . But there 's a new generation of Betrayers that 's harder to destroy . You have to learn how the Betrayers are made if we 're going to beat them . What do we do ? Walk into the local Betrayer factory ? That 's exactly what we 'll do . It means hitting the surface . Were you not just here ? 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth Wow ! Mmm , fresh air ! Oh , God , it 's awesome ! Get over here ! Sorry . Living in a hole in the ground makes a girl appreciate a little sunshine . - It 's over here , guys . - Awesome ? What kind of word is that ? But I thought the Bailies drove everyone underground . No , the Bailies allow these Dworks to live here . Sarge thinks they 're models for Betrayers . The Dworks think the Bailies are friendly aliens that take select folk - to their planet . - She 'll mark the next one to be taken . Then we 're going to track the Bailey to the Betrayer factory . She 's a fast learner . - She can be . What was that ? Was that The Voice ? Did she say something about me ? What ? See that one in the purple get-up ? - She 's the next one to be taken . - Hmm . Nice work . She 's coming in nice and clear . We 'll be able to track her easy . I 'm gonna get you ! - What 's wrong , Sarge ? - That 's my sister . Your sister ? - You were a Dwork ? - Sh ! Listen . - There . Wow . What are they ? We gotta go get her . - You won 't let them take her ? - So we just scrap our mission ? She 's your family . Go . I 'll cover you . What are you doing ? Shields up ! Come on ! Run ! Run where ? Aaargh ! Sarge . Wait . Hold up here . Our cloaking devices should confuse it . Hopefully , it 'll move on . Rose ? Rose ? Yeah , and she 's Lily . They named us all after flowers . That 's cute . Voice , we have a complication . Sisters reuniting . Isn 't this beautiful ? Aren 't you two going to hug ? Come on . How about a handshake ? If Cleopatra can pull off her part , this will work . All right . Tryit . Butifsomething goes wrong , I want you to abort immediately . Clear . You erm ... understand the plan , right ? Oh , sure , I was totally into that stuff in the 21 st ... You still haven 't explained anything . Where have you been ? Why did you attack the emissary ? Beam us up , Scotty . Then get it fixed . The transporter 's still down . - We can 't return to the starship . - What do you mean , starship ? Your sister isn 't real sharp , is she ? Travelling between Earth and the mother planet is hard without a starship . Even for your sister . LILY : You 've been to the mother planet , Rose ? - Where do you think Rose has been for ten years ? Crawling around underground like a worm ? She is on a mission . That 's why she was trying to signal the emissary . You were trying to get their attention ? Yeah . Yes . This is why she must be the next one that the Bailies take . It is of the utmost importance , Lily , for Rose to return to the mother planet as soon as possible . Lily , your sister has had a close encounter of the fourth kind , and must continue her quest to solve the X-Files . - Oh , yes . - The X-Files ? The truth is out there , Lily . Scary how she comes up with that stuff , huh ? Yeah , she lies real well . Of course , that surface scum will believe just about anything they 're told . Sarge , what have you got ? Look out ! Shields up ! Help ! My shield 's gone . I know . Hel ! Behind you ! Hel ! Sarge ! Look out ! Nice shot . - Mauser 's gonna love those . - What were those things ? Some new Bailey probe . - Stay alert . - OK . Come on . Hel 's going for the factory . You know the plan , Cleo ? No problem . I just have to convince these guys that the emissaries have to take you next . Live long and prosper . May the Force be with you . Commander Cleopatra 's explaining your mission to the elders . - You 're welcome home , Rose . - Will I be the next one taken ? They haven 't decided yet but I 'm sure the answer will be yes . The Commander 's so convincing . Hey , I missed you . Hel , are you sleeping ? Oh , no . I 'm more awake now than I 've ever been . The night sky ... - I 've never seen it before . - Beautiful , isn 't it ? - Awesome . - Awesome ? Sounds like Cleopatra has been rubbing off on you . So this is what we 're fighting for ? This is where we belong , Hel . - So , tell me about Mother and Father - What ? Mother and Father . You must have seen them on the mother planet . - The Bailies took them years ago . - Yes , and they 're doing very well . Your mother is the head of the Space Odyssey Research Team and your father is an instructor - at the Battlestar Galactica . - Oh , wow ! Rose , you must be so proud . Listen to me , Lily . Nothing here is what it seems . I haven 't been to the mother planet , Cleo is no Commander and Mom and Dad are not waiting anywhere . How do you know if you haven 't even been there ? Come on , Lily , don 't buy into this crap they 've been feeding you . It 's all lies . Come on , you have to try to think for yourself . Are you listening to me ? Don 't you let those emissaries take you ! Rose Stop teasing her . Yeah . That 's right . Just teasing . It 's OK , it 's OK . Attagirl , Sarge . Oh , yeah . She 's gonna lead us to Betrayer Central . Oh , that 's original ! Stop ! She 's not from the mother planet . She 's from the underground . Lily ! Please ! Take me ! I 'm the one that 's supposed to go . - Look ! - What are you doing ? She 's the one that attacked you this morning . - What are you doing ? - Damn ! What is it ? - It ain 't good . I 'm the one that 's supposed to go . I 'm the chosen one . Please . Please , take me . Plea ... Aaaargh ! Lily ! Lily ! - Are you OK ? - Uh-huh . - Take me ! Please ! - No ! Cleo ! Just leave her ! I 'm the one that 's supposed to go ! Damn . What 's your plan , Hel ? - Sarge gave Lily a dose of tracking fluid . I 'm getting a slight reading . We can track her . Sarge , I know you blame Lily for losing Cleo . - Any reason why I shouldn 't ? - No . You 're angry with your sister . Fine . I 'm not pleased with her either . But we 're walking into bad guys ' territory and I cannot afford to have you distracted by some family squabble . You don 't have to worry about me . Good . We 'll take out Lily first thing . When she 's down , we 'll grab Cleo and bug out . No problem . Problem . Aaaargh ! Aaaaaargh ! This must be Roswell . Where they prepare to take us to the mother planet . I 've anointed myself in the prescribed manner ! Lily ! Lily ! Sh ! Listen up , space cadet . There is no mother planet . That was just a line . Oh , really ? Like your close encounter with Mr Spock ? Was that a line too ? A joke you delivered to your friends to mock our beliefs ? OK , I do believe in aliens . All right ? But they 're not all cute and cuddly . Some come bursting out of your tummy or give you the Vulcan death grip . There is no Vulcan death grip . And you don 't belong here . Duh ! Damn ! I lost the signal . The tracking fluid must have worn off . - There 's only one alternative . Not the Drones . - I can 't allow that . - Come on . I could use a little help here . Why would I want to escape ? I was chosen to make the journey to the mother planet . If I don 't get this door open , nobody 's going anywhere . Damn ! Your sister could probably open that with a paperclip and a piece of string . Well , why don 't you wait for her ? She 'll probably turn up . She seems to enjoy disrupting the rites of the ascension . They have a war to fight . I don 't think they have time to come looking for me . Hel. you can 't let Sarge fire that up there . - It 's that or we come home without Cleopatra . - Not an option . The last team that used that thing was wiped out . No survivors . So we just do nothing while they turn our friend into a Betrayer ? There 's a plan ! Ready ? - Locked and loaded . - I 'll launch the Drone . Go back to the lab . - No sense in both of us getting killed . - I know what you 're doing . - What ? - You think if you keep me from seeing Lily , I 'll cool off , right ? Well , it wouldn 't be the first time I 've had to sit on you - to keep you from doing something crazy - Unless you can take this off me , I 've work to do . All right . It is time . - I 'm ready . - No ! Lily ! Remember Rose said never let them take you . - Rose is an unbeliever . She hides from the light . - It is time . We got it . What if your sister was right ? She 's not my sister any more . Scanning . - And we 've got company . - Sarge ! - Yeah , I know . - Come on ! - Just a minute . Now . - Got it ! - Cut the link . It lost our signal . It can 't see through our shields . It knows we 're here . COMPUTER : Your journey is about to begin . You will not be harmed . Joy and enlightenment await you . Do not be afraid . I 'm not afraid . I await joy and enlightenment on the mother planet . It 's OK , guys . It 's cool , man . Oh , man , look ... I 'm really not into needles ... Argh ! I have been chosen by the elders to complete the journey of truth ... Ow ! Cleopatra ? What are they doing ? It ain 't joy and enlightenment , space cadet . COMPUTER : Relax Don 't move . As long as Mauser 's shields hold , it can 't find us . OK , that 's new . Voice , we 're in trouble . Hel . I 'll launch a Drone to lure away the Bailey . Looks like we just lost our tactical edge on the ground . We 've still got a fix on the factory . It 's this way . 1,200 metres . - What are they ? - Some kind of pod people . What 's going on ? This isn 't the way it 's supposed to be . Why are they doing this ? They 're draining our life forces to power those things . My sister was right . Lily , we have to fight it . - I can 't . - Lily ! Fight ! The voices ... - It 's going to be fine ... This is a dream . - Yes , Voice , I hear you . - The Voice has saved us so many times . The Voice . - She knows about The Voice . - She may be of even greater use to us . There 's the factory . - I 'll take point . - I hope you know what you 're doing . - You mean about Lily ? - She 's your sister . She 's my sister . She 's also weak and stupid . So our mission gets blown and Cleopatra will maybe come back with guns on her arms . All because of my stupid sister . Do what you want to do . But I wouldn 't be able to live with myself afterwards . You don 't have to . We could do serious damage with these cloaking generators . - Sure . When they 're not in the shop . Voice ? - Yes Hel ? Tell Mauser to download Cleopatra 's biochem profile into the Drone launcher . - Got a plan , Hel ? - Oh , yeah . Lily ... Are you still with me , girl ? Lily . Lily ! This is not good . The data 's been uploaded , Hel . - Launcher . I 've adjusted the Drone so it keys off Cleopatra 's pheromone signature . - You 're going to sniff her out ? - Go get her , boy . - Talk to me , Sarge . - Got her . Let 's go . I 've had enough of you guys . Uh ... Hel ! Lily . Aaaargh ! Help ! - Are you all right ? - I feel like my brain 's been sucked into an unstoppable killing machine , - and a little dry-mouthed . - Come on . Wake up ! - You came to save me ? - Shut up ! Sarge ! LILY : I 'm sorry . Everything you said was true . I know I was wrong . Please , Rose , I just wanted to be with Mother and Father . I didn 't want to be alone . Please forgive me . - - I 'm sorry . Let 's blow this place . Get down ! Go ! Go ! Damn ! All these tunnels look the same . Oh , no . - Come on ! - Get over here , now ! Voice , we 're trapped . And our delay grenades are set to go off any second . Shoot the floor ! - What ? - Shoot the floor ! - Voice says shoot the floor . Can 't hurt . Come on . Thanks . I wasn 't sure you 'd be coming back for me . We never leave a team member behind . - I 'm a team member ? - Sh ! What about Lily ? She can 't go back to the surface . The Bailies will come after her . Well ... I guess you could come with us . Er ... I don 't know . It 's kind of dark down here . Oh , your eyes adjust after a while . Look , Lily , it 's not the surface . But you 've got a lot to learn down here and ... .. well , I could teach you . OK , show me . Ready ? Whoo ! Next week : 107 Run Cleo Run

 We are not alone ! Forget what you think you know . Forget what your mother told you when she tucked you in at night . Forget the lies of our oppressive allied governments . Behind this curtain is the very secret they do not want you to see . The most astounding scientific find in the history of humanity proof of alien life ! That 's right . Go ahead and laugh , sir . But what you 'll see inside this room will change your life forever . It will haunt your dreams and harrow , yes , your very soul . Yep . It 's a cow fetus . Guess so . Does seem to have an awful lot of limbs . It 's mutated . But a cow ? How do you figure ? It 's upside down . Oh , yeah . Cow . Yep . And I 'm out 12 bits . I really know how to show a girl a disgusting time . No , it 's sweet . Poor thing never saw the light of day . Now it 's in show business . You manage to find the bright side of every single thing . Also , we 've got this booth to ourselves for five whole minutes . - We 're not alone , remember ? - He 's not gonna squawk . Tell me more good stuff about me . Uh ... Well , you 're kind of a genius , when it comes to machines . You always say what you mean . And your eyes ... Yeah ? Eyes , yeah ? And , um ... I don 't know how to ... Well , plus every other girl I know is either married , professional or closely related to me so you 're more or less , literally , the only girl in the world . - Hm , that 's a hell of a thing to say . - I was joking . Oh , no , no , I get it . I do . Back on Osiris , you probably had nurses and debutantes crawling all over you but down here , at the bottom of the barrel , it 's just me . No . That 's not even ... I 'm glad I rated higher than dead Bessie , here . Oh , my God , it 's grotesque ! Oh , and there 's something in a jar . Scare her away again , did you ? This may come as a shock , but I 'm actually not very good at talking to girls . Why , is there someone you are good at talking to ? Do not fear me . Ours is a peaceful race and we must live in harmony . - Struck out again ? - It 's like something out of a fable . This priceless artifact , the biggest score of my career and no one will touch it . The Lassiter 's universally known . Fencing it is like fencing the Mona Lisa . Well , but ... Mona who ? You 're out of your league . You should consider my offer . I 'm done thinking about that , and you are to stay clear . - I know people in highest ranks ... - Jabber , jabber , I ain 't listening . Just because you helped out on the job don 't make you a crook . I will not have you jeopardizing your career over this . The career you abhor and look down on ? I just don 't want you in the way of trouble . Take it as you like . Amnon ! - How you been ? - Malcolm ! An old friend 's face is a balm in this age . - You holding some post for me ? - Yeah . Got quite a haul . - You can sign for everyone ? - Sure . - Any packages for me ? - Don 't know yet . My food is problematic . Girl 's a mind-reading genius . Can 't figure out how to eat an ice-planet . - Did you get everything ? - Yeah . They didn 't have rounds for the bunder , but we 're ammo 'd up pretty good . I got a discount on account of my intimidating manner . Oh . This one 's addressed to you and Zoe , Mal . I don 't remember ordering parts . - The little one 's for Cobb . - I got post ? Might we all want to step a few paces back before he opens that . Ha , ha ! It 's from my mother . - So do aliens live among us ? - Yeah . One of them 's a doctor . " My dear boy , I hope you are well and that you get this soon in your travels " . - Did you order any equipment ? - No , sir . " Thank you for the credits you forwarded . They have helped , as Mattie is still sick with the Damplung . I made you the enclosed ... Enclosed , to keep you warm in your travels . Hope to hear from you soon . Love your mother " . How 's it sit ? Pretty cunning , don 't you think ? I think it 's the sweetest hat ever . A man walks down the street in that , people know he 's not afraid of anything . Damn straight . Let 's hope we get some funny hats too . What did you all order a dead guy for ? Thanks . I didn 't know you were out there . Sort of the point . Stealth . You may have heard of it . I don 't think they covered that in basic . Well , at least they covered dropping your weapon so you can eat beans and get yourself shot . Yeah , I got a badge in that . - Won 't happen again . - Lf it does , I 'm just gonna watch . Anything interesting out there ? If you don 't mind my asking . About 30 troops behind those buildings . Mortars . No rollers yet . I expect they plan to peck at us for a spell before they charge . They had two scouts sniffing . I took them down . Wow , I didn 't hear a single thing . First rule of battle , little one don 't ever let them know where you are . Whee-hee ! I 'm right here ! I 'm right here ! You want some of me ? ! Yeah , you do ! Come on ! Come on ! Whoo-hoo ! There are other schools of thought . Whew ! Ha ! That was bracing . Don 't like it when you shoot at them . I worked that out myself . - Did you find Vitelli ? - Vitelli is out of it . The bumble bee laid down arms at the first sign of inevitable defeat . Can you imagine such a cowardly creature ? Southwest corridor 's open , huh ? - Tracey , ain 't you dead yet ? - Through no fault of my own . I really wanted your beans . They 're gonna come right through here . They got rollers ? They got every damn thing . How 's the lieutenant ? Started screaming , all of a sudden , about his arms , where is his arms ? - We had to go find them . - What happened ? He ain 't even hurt . He got 10 fingers on his hands but he 's screaming like they 're gone , crying . And he ain 't said a word in two hours . Sir ? Do we hold ? I don 't wanna die here . Forgive me . This rock ain 't worth it . Not our lives . Everybody dies . Someone 's carrying a bullet for you right now who doesn 't know it . The trick is , die of old age before it finds you . We could still cut through the 22nd at school system . Make a decent stand there . Well , we can 't do any good here . I sure as hell ain 't gonna lay down arms . Zoe you heard the lieutenant give the order to join the 22nd ? - I did . - Round them up , then . - You heard him too . - I ain 't gonna rat you out . Ain 't me I 'm worried on . If lieutenant gets his mind back this shouldn 't go on his record . Ain 't his fault . More than he 'd probably ... Seeker ! - Is it bad ? Is it bad ? - It 's glorious ! - We gotta move ! - I can 't ! We gotta run ! Zoe , get the lieutenant . You know the old saying . Well , it don 't make any kind of sense . Zoe ? I got nothing . But it 's definitely Tracey . You know this guy ? Is this a warning of some kind ? Mal , you gotta get this thing out of my station . No , no , no . Human transport on a postal route is very illegal . If anyone knows I took a corpse , I 'll lose my franchise . - Who sent it ? - I don 't know . There was no return . - How long has it been here ? - A week . - This can 't stay here . JAYNE : He don 't smell . I know . Been decently preserved . Give me a hand . - We 're taking him onboard ? - We are . - I don 't see the percentage in that . - Don 't strain your brain trying . It might break something . We got it . What 's going on ? Did we get something fun ? You are such a boob . JAYNE : How do we know he ain 't plague-ridden , or something ? - We know . - We don 't , actually . I mean , I respect that you guys have a history , but what are you doing ? If you want me to do a proper autopsy ... - Cut him up ? - Not just yet , thank you , doctor . Robot . What do you got ? Um , okay , uh ... Recording . Hi , I guess . This is a message for Zoe and for Malcolm Reynolds and I really hope you all are the ones listening to it . I 'll spare you the boring details falling in with untrustworthy folk making a bunch of bad calls . All that matters is I expect to be shuffled off and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I 'm going which is home . I 'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans . We got the family plot there , and my mom and dad , well they deserve to know I died . You know , it 's funny , we went to the war never looking to come back but it 's the real world I couldn 't survive . You two carried me through that war and now I need you to carry me just a little bit further , if you can . Tell my folks I wanted to do right by them and that I 'm at peace and all . When you can 't run anymore , you crawl , and when you can 't do that , well ... Yeah , you know the rest . Thanks , both of you . Oh , yeah , and make sure my eyes is closed , will you ? Wash ? St. Albans is a two-day ride if we burn hard enough . - That might make your schedule ... - It 's all right . That 's right , gentlemen , you have been told tales all your life but alien races exist among us . The proof is right inside . You 'll be amazed and astounded . Can I help you ? You are an ugly-looking little quim , you know that ? - Lf there 's a problem , I can ... - You must be asking yourself how repulsive-looking the guy that 's gonna make you his woman gonna be ? I mean , prison is a lonely place . You sure as a hundred moons ain 't gonna be pitching . So , what kind of sorry-ass troll is gonna get blue enough to grapple with you ? Shudder to think . I 've broken no law . Transportation of human cargo , especially dead cargo through the allied postal system is punishable by five to 10 years . Plus , you don 't know this yet , but you resisted arrest . - Where 's my body ? - I don 't know . The dead guy . He got shipped here . - He shipped back out , I guess . Where ? - I never saw a body . But wait . There was a crate big enough for one . I mean , I did hand that over , just a little while ago . Lovely . Who got it ? Um ... Here . Malcolm Reynolds . Where do you suppose he 's off to ? He captains a Firefly . You should be able to capture him if you leave now . - Are you telling me to leave ? - No , I didn 't mean that . Relax . You 've been great . I was just bluffing about arresting you . Who needs that kind of paperwork ? Skunk , light him on fire . No , wait ! I told you everything ... Come on , come on ! I told you what I knew ! What ... ? What do you ... ? I ... I just ... Tell anyone we were here warn Capt. Reynolds that we 're coming and you 'll wish that we burned you . Good . Boys , let 's go find us a corpse . I really hope you all are the ones listening to it . I 'll spare you the boring details falling in with untrustworthy folk , making a bunch of bad calls . All that matters is I expect to be shuffled off and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I 'm going which is home . I 'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans . We got the family plot there , and my mom and dad , well they deserve to know I died . You know , it 's funny , we went to the war never looking to come back but it 's the real world I couldn 't survive . Sorry , preacher . Am I making too much noise ? No , no . I was just saying a few words . Don 't know the boy 's denomination , but ... Oh , no , it 's good . The Lord should ought to look after the dead . You wanna do a set ? I 'll spot you . I 'm not so terribly in the mood . Most people is pretty quiet about now . Me ? I see a stiff , one I didn 't have to kill myself , I just get the urge to you know , do stuff , like work out or run around maybe get some trim , if there 's a willing woman about . Not that I get flush with corpses or anything . I ain 't crazy . It makes sense . Looking to feel alive out of adventure . Now , for psychology , that don 't sound half-dumb . My kind of life don 't last long , preacher . So I expect I 'm invested in making good sport of it whilst I can . You gonna read over me when I get taken down ? Oh , I suspect you 'll be around long after we 're all gone . What the hell are you doing ? - River , that might not be the best place ... - I 'm very comfortable . I guess we do all have different reactions to death . I thought I was gonna die . - How could he possibly even ... ? - The colonel was dead drunk . Three hours pissing on about the enlisted men . " They 're scum . They 're not fighters " . And then he passed right out . Boom . We couldn 't even move him , so Tracey snipped it right off his face . And you never seen a man more proud of his mustache than him . I mean , I will never love a woman the way this officer loved that lip ferret . Big walrussy thing , all waxed up . Did he find out ? Oh , the next morning , he wakes up , it 's gone and he is furious ! But he can 't just say , you know , " Someone stole my mustache ! " So he calls together all the platoons . - We thought he was gonna shoot us . - He 's eyeballing us something fierce . Not a word . He comes up to Tracey , and Tracey 's wearing the thing on his face ! He glued it on ! He 's staring the old man down wearing his own damn mustache . Oh , God . Well , the colonel must have said ... - Are we hit ? - That was too damn close . They 're behind us . Fire over the port bow . - Warning shot ? - They could 've hit us . Feds . This is Lt. Womack of Allied Enforcement . You 're in possession of stolen goods and are ordered to cut thrust and prepare for docking . - The Lassiter . - That was quick . Do you think Saffron tipped them off ? This is Capt. Reynolds . I think there 's been a mistake . There 's been a lot of mistakes . The latest of which is you taking that crate . Um , we took in a lot of inventory today . If something got mixed in , we 'll hand it back , but I don 't think we 're your men . Let me check through the cargo . Is it marked ? I 'd think twice about playing games with me there , mister . I will blow you to pieces . You do that , your precious crate 's gonna be in shards . I got deliveries to make , so you just lock on to my trajectory and I 'll take a look here , see if anything matches your description . - Police procedure has changed . - He calls back , you keep him occupied . - What do I do ? Shadow puppets ? - We 'll take care of it . - I don 't get this . They 're after Tracey ? - Or there 's something else in that box . Anything ? Not unless this crate 's made of magical wish-granting planks . Check his pockets . - That ain 't right . - Well , neither is being blowed up . - Nothing about this sits right with me . - Empty . Well , they want this body for something , and I 'm guessing it ain 't a proper burial . Well , doctor , I guess you are doing an autopsy . You really think there 's something in there ? Using corpses for smuggling is a time-honored , repulsive custom . Maybe it 's gold . And maybe he was a friend of ours , and you need to show a little respect . I got respect . I 'm just saying gold . He 's been open before . How 's that ? It 's ... It 's good work . Scar 's nearly invisible , but ... Well , let 's see what 's in there . - Get ahold of him ! - Spry , for a dead fella . Settle down ! Settle ! That 's enough . - He was cutting on me , sarge . - I know . I told him to . - You told him to ? What for ? - Because you were dead ! Huh ? Oh . Right . I suppose I was . - Hey , there , Zoe . - Private . - You feeling a mite calmer now ? - Yes , sarge . - Um , sarge ? - Yeah ? I think I 'm naked . Sorry for jumping on you the way I did . I was a little confounded . Rising from that state can be disorienting . Was it byphodine ? Can you bring that pan , please ? The drug you took to make it appear you were dead . Remember what it was called ? Never did ask . The guy who sold it to me said I 'd be under a week or so . He told me I wouldn 't dream , but I did . I dreamt of my family . You can take that . All right . Wanna explain exactly why you got yourself all corpsified and mailed to me ? What are you running from ? Running to , not from . I just wanted to get home , that 's all . That 's all I ever wanted . Except there 's them that take exception to that to me leaving while I was in possession of their property . What 'd you boost , Tracey ? - Was it gold ? - More importantly who 'd you boost it from ? - Well ... - Captain , I don 't mean to ... We may have a medical emergency here . This man appears to be in cardiac arrest . What ? Tracey , are you having a heart attack ? It don 't look like he is . Don 't pay any attention to your machines , doc . They 'll fib to you . Heart 's just fine . Better than fine . Just runs a little hotter than the usual , that 's all . My God ! It 's not just the heart muscle , it 's everything . All the moving parts . That 's what I took , Mal . That 's what they want back . Tracey , are you gonna tell me what in the chin-cha-doh you 're talking about ? Sure , sarge . Sure . - Thank you . - So your innards ain 't your innards ? They got scooped out . Replaced every bit . What 'd you wanna go and do that for ? For the money . They 're paying me to transport what they stuck in . You 're smuggling human organs ? They 're grown in a lab . Only way to move them is in a person . - Not sure why . - The technology 's not ready . Blastomeres are unapproved . Likely unstable . You 're not just a carrier , you 're an incubator . I was supposed to be at the drop two weeks ago . Clinic in Ariel . They were to open me up , take out the goods and put my own organs back . - So , what happened ? - Better offer . Another buyer was willing to go three times the going rate . Enough so I could get my folks off that rock they live on set them up someplace better . Someplace warm . That 's real nice . But your better offer went south . Yeah , I got myself in a little bit of a pickle , sarge . The folks I was working for got wind of what I had planned . I showed up , my new buyer was dead and some men were waiting for me . But you got away . Only just . I knew they 'd never stop looking for me so long as I was alive . Thought my chances would be better if I weren 't . So you died and figured they 'd stop looking for you ? Yep . I think maybe you figured wrong . I think they 're about done being stalled to ... Mal ! - Your dead army buddy 's on the bridge ! - He ain 't dead . - Oh . - How far are we to St. Albans ? Five minutes from atmo . Bring up the terrain specs . Kaylee , get him out of here ! Strap in ! This is Capt. Reynolds . Reynolds , I 'm a dangerous-minded man on a ship loaded with hurt . Now , why you got me chatting with your peons ? Tracey , you go on down below . We 'll handle this . Uh , uh ... Just seeing to some technical difficulties . I 'm not interested , captain . I stepped over a lot of bodies to get to that one you got in your hold . You play this right and yours won 't have to be among them . - Sarge ... - The captain ordered you off the bridge ! Come on . We 'd love to let you dock but that buck knocked out our fore-couple . So we have to park it if you want the tour . All right , captain . We can do this on the ground just as easy . Yeah , easy . There . - Think you can do it ? - Watch me . Attention , crew , this is the captain . Sit down and hang on to something . Uh , you okay ? - So I can let go of you now ? - Oh , you can . Yeah . All this hard banking when the gravity drive and actual gravity start working against each other it tosses the lunch about . - Your pilot 's pretty wild . He can thread a needle with this bird . He 's the best . That 's good to know . - So are you and he ... ? - Sweeties ? Oh , hell , no ! He 's married to Zoe . - Zoe got married ? - Yeah . Yeah , next , you 'll be telling me she smiles , has emotions . She must have been stone-cold during the war . I think the sarge was even a little bit afraid of her . Now she 's married . Well , that 's good . People making a life for each other . Had enough of this goose-run . Don 't need no ante-tour of this ice cube . - Now , let 's park it ! - Just looking for a good spot . What is it ? It 's a little strange . There 's a Fed station right here but our friends haven 't made a transmission since they broke atmo . So , what about you ? Oh , you know , mostly just ... Ow . ... stuff like this . Just finding myself in one scrape or another . Sorry to drag you all into this . Oh , danger 's pretty much our business . Still , if you got put in a bad spot at all , Kaylee ... I 'd be real unhappy . Get ready for a hard burn . They 'd be crazy to follow us in here . They 're not behind us anymore . I didn 't think of that . Oh ! Whoa , okay ! Ah ! Whoo-hoo-hoo ! - This kind of flying wakes up a guy ! - Awake helps . There . Now if we shut down the main power ... They might not read our auxiliary under all this . What if they come down to get a visual ? She 's not a small ship . We 're not moving . Why aren 't we moving ? Probably part of some genius plan to give the Feds the slip . Yeah , probably . What was that ? Sounds like full-yield mag drops . I think they picked up a little triangulation in cop school . 1001 . - 1002 . - River ? I 'm counting between lightning and thunder to see if the storm 's coming or going . 1005 . Options ? Well , we 're only as good as long as the roof holds out . Direct hit above us ship 's electrics will be fried . - We 'll have to climb out . - Yeah , or get dug out . Getting closer . Captain , there is another way . Uh , captain said to stay put . I just wanna see what 's happening . We 're cornered , and it 's only a matter of time before they find us what 's left of us . Let 's not wait for that to happen . What are you saying ? I 'm saying we make good on what we said we were gonna do . Let 's call them . Fly out of this canyon , let them board . Give ourselves up ? It 's our only choice . We let them board , we 're taking an awful chance . - These boys ain 't playing , preacher . - I 'm aware of that . That one was really close . That tears it . I 'm with the preacher . I ain 't getting snowed in permanent on account of some jackass kid ! It 's the only option , captain . Wash , call the cops . Tell them we give up . No , thank you ! - Tracey , what are you doing ? - I said , no ! Those bastards want to yank out this million-credit meat and leave me bleeding . Now turn off that radio ! Twerp 's gonna get us killed ! Don 't you move ! Don 't anybody move ! All right , we need to power up . We need to run . Now ! Put that thing down . You have no idea ... Oh , shut it , Shepherd ! Or I swear to your god , I will shoot you dead if you do not ! Sarge ! Zoe ! What are you doing with this Bible thumper ? - Wash , call the cops . - But ... I 'll kill him ! I 'll put a hole right through him ! You mailed your ugly business to Zoe and me , Tracey . Cash on delivery . I 'll go to hell before I watch you turn and bite us for the favor . Wash , call them up , tell them we 'll meet them topside . - No , thank you ! - Do it . No ! You shot me . Damn right . - That 's enough shooting . - Wash ! - Ow ? - Everybody calm down . - Kaylee , get out of there ! - You 're a rabbit , Mal ! Hurry ! Hurry ! I probably scared you back there , didn 't I ? Did you see his face ? It was great . - You 're really bleeding . - Yep . They shot me . - Why ? - Because they wanna sell me off . You won 't let them do that , will you , Kaylee ? Because , you know , I think you and I really had a moment back there . - Tracey ? - You know , Kaylee I need to fly out of here . Can we take the shuttle and go ? - I ain 't going anywhere with you . - Nobody 's going anywhere , private . Captain , what is going on ? Don 't make me . Far as I can see , no one 's made you do anything . You brought this on yourself . Got in over your head with those stone-cold gut-runners . Then you panicked , brought the whole mess down on all of us . - That ain 't what happened . - Oh , yes , that 's what happened . I 'm thinking some of that trail of bodies Womack talked about was left by you . And you ain 't left a trail of bodies , work you do ? - Because your rep speaks elsewise . - Weren 't bodies of people helping me . And you 're helping out lots . Because I needed a chest wound . That can be seen to . - Do you think I 'm stupid ? - In every way possible . Do you know why I picked you and Zoe ? Because you 're saps ! You repping out as stone killers but I still remember the old sarge with his stories and his homilies of glory and honor . - Maybe you should 've listened . Yeah , well , what are you now ? What are we now , Mal ? See there ? You hear that quiet ? Means the call 's already been made . Well , that call ... That call means you just murdered me . No , son you murdered yourself . I just carried the bullet a while . Well , now , somebody left the dog off the leash . I 've been shot too many times to be scared by a gun . Womack , I think I broke your junk . A little problem during shipping . Don 't think I have to tell you folk the kind of trouble you 're in ! Wetware smuggling , resisting and fleeing an officer of the law . I 'm sure the search of the ship will come up with another few felonies . You won 't be searching the ship , Womack . - That so ? - It is . You won 't be taking us in . Nor the boy who 's dying up there . Now , I 'm authorized to kill as I like . Shepherds notwithstanding . Why is it you didn 't call in for backup ? There 's a Fed station 80 miles from where you 're standing . You got your command stripes at the Silver Hold colonies . Puts you about eight sectors away from your jurisdiction . Since you 're running this job on the side you took pains to keep your presence here secret . I doubt it would bother anyone if we laid your bodies to rest at the bottom of one of these canyons . It 's damaged goods anyhow . That hat makes you look like an idiot . So that was the plan ? That was a good plan . I think so . Um , you ... You weren 't that far off about me being stupid . I never could get my life working right . Not once after the war . Kaylee , I 'm so sorry . I didn 't ... - Sarge ? - Right here . You ... That stupid message of mine and I was trying to play you guys . And now you 'll do it . - You 'll get me home . - Yeah . - Yeah . - Well , you know the old saying : When you can 't run , you crawl and when you can 't crawl , when you can 't do that ... You find someone to carry you . You know , it 's funny we went to the war never looking to come back but it 's the real world I couldn 't survive . You two carried me through that war and now I need you to carry me just a little bit further if you can . Tell my folks I wanted to do right by them and that I 'm at peace and all . When you can 't run anymore , you crawl , and when you can 't do that , well yeah , you know the rest .

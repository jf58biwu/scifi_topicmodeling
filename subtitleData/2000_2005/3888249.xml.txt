 Three hundred and fifty years ? Ah huh , give or take . Elizabeth I was queen and my ancestor was a Captain in her royal guard . Probably the reason she never got married . She knighted him for bravery later made him a Lord . He must have been very good indeed . A family legend . Just how much money does your family have ? Something wrong ? You 're not going to peel it for me ? I could . Would you ? Now you 're not trying to start something you don 't intend to finish again , are you ? Oh I believe that was you the last time . Well I won 't be this time . What was that ? Nothing . Now where were we ? Wow , it 's a good thing we don 't do that everyday . Oh I don 't know , it felt pretty good to me . Where are we ? Stuck down a hole . Or someone 's coffin . I haven 't seen many like him around here before . Looks like a pirate . That 's just what I was thinking . What 's he doing here ? Hey ! - Oh I don 't believe it . - It couldn 't be ? Nice shooting Marguerite . Careful it could be booby trapped . You 're right you better open it . It would be my pleasure . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World We 're going to need the others to get it back to the treehouse . What is it ? Death to all and any who touch my ... plunder ... - Captain Bonny . - Very funny . Is it ? Well , what else was he going to write ' help yourself ' ? I say we dig a hole for the Captain and his ... treasure and leave them both right here . Bury the good Captain if you like but the ... treasure is going back to the treehouse . What for ? You can 't spend any of it ... until you find a way off this plateau . It 's perfectly safe right where it is . Afraid of a little curse ? It 's just dead weight to carry around Marguerite . And quite frankly who needs the exercise hmmm ? There 's got to be a shovel around here somewhere . Roxton the treasure is going back ... to the treehouse whether you help me or I get the others . And how are you going to get it out of here if I don 't give you a hand ? And what are you going to do , leave me here ? Once I know where it is , I can come back and get it any time I like . Just trying to save you a little work . Roxton 's right , we don 't need a pile of stolen treasure lying around here . - Look at these priceless artifacts . - This stuff belongs in a museum . Not to mention a private auction . Discoveries like these are all part of the expedition . Anybody could have found the chest in the pit . Its better we keep it here . I sure would like to find out where it came from . Now that is a mystery that deserves to be investigated . Did it come from a ship ? And if so , why was it dragged all the way up on to the plateau ? I still say : put it back . Yes well you 've already raised your objections ... and we voted on it . You and Roxton lost . Democracy in action . Look at this Captain Bonny 1835 . What does it say ? It says : put it back before it 's too late . This can 't be true . Ship fell through the sky ... last known location Northeast of Bermuda . The Devil 's Triangle . Ships have been disappearing in that part of the ocean ... for hundreds of years . So they say . We 've never had proof of the phenomenon . - Maybe not until now . - Come on . Where did they land ? - Where are the remains of their ship ? - They landed in water ... a small saltwater sea . The ship broke up and sank . The Inland Sea . Captain Bonny and a few crew members made it to shore with the treasure . So he dug himself a hole in the middle of nowhere and died ... defending his useless treasure . And now it 's ours to defend . If we can pinpoint exactly ... where this ship dropped into the Inland Sea . I may be able to learn how this phenomenon works . And then what ? Reverse the process ? Launch us up into the atmosphere and ... spit us out into the Mid-Atlantic ? I admit it sounds preposterous . But then , any avenue that may lead ... to a way off this plateau is worth pursuing . - Wouldn 't you agree ? - I can 't argue with that . How long you planning to spend there ? Oh four or five days perhaps ... maybe longer . But don 't you feel any obligation to come ... Malone is more than enthusiastic . Always the journalist . He 's still got empty pages to fill . Besides you may be better off trying to keep the ... peace between Veronica and Marguerite . Good luck . Marguerite do you have to scatter this junk ... all over the house ? Oh no , junk is what was here before . This is more the style I 'm accustomed to . I 'm sure this one must have been the Captain 's favorite . Yes , pirate Captain remember . Put it in your room I don 't want to have anything to do with it . As you wish , as soon as I finish taking inventory . Veronica really , the curse is utter nonsense , nothing but the ... scratching of a drunken pirate . There is nothing real or supernatural about it . What about fate ? Destiny ? or poetic justice ? No match for free will and determination . And greed , let 's not forget your real motivation . And what would you know about my real motivation ? Unlike the pair of you , apparently , I like to surround myself with things of value and beauty . - Where does that leave us ? - On the outside looking in . With envy . Not anymore . Didn 't you notice ? Now that Malone and Challenger have gone to explore the Inland Sea , - the odds have changed . - What odds ? The odds of you getting outvoted . We 're not going to have another vote . Maybe just a small recount . - Roxton ! - You know my vote . Over my dead body . I will fight you both if I have to . - Fight ? - Ohhh ! You really want to fight about it ? It 's what I said . Not very democratic . Roxton wake up . - Trouble ? - Everything 's fine . Marguerite 's asleep . - As we all should be . - Ah . We have to get that treasure out of here . What ? We don 't need to invite trouble , come on . What do you intend to do about Marguerite ? - Knock her out . - What ? I gave her some herbal tea , one of my mother 's favorite recipes for insomnia . Oh really . Turn around . Marguerite would be proud . She 'll get the best night sleep she 's had in weeks . Do you really think she 'd use that gun ? I 'm sure it 's just for show . She really scares me sometimes . Layer upon layer of self preservation . Sometimes it 's hard ... to get to the truth . It 's amazing you never stop trying . Underneath it all she 's not so ... very different from the rest of us . You mean when she 's like this ? Roxton ! Veronica ! I 'm not laughing anymore ! Where is it ? This had better be a joke ! Veronica , if you have taken it back to that pit , I guarantee you will feel the wrath of that damn pirate . She 's never gonna find it . - Where is it ? - Oh Marguerite , calm down . I am calm . You take me to it , now . It 's perfectly safe and we know exactly where it is . But no one else is going to know until we find our way home . This was your idea . No , my idea was to throw it down the ... deepest crevice we could find . Show me where it is and we can still be friends . I like it just the way it is . Oh Marguerite it 's for the best . And as Veronica says , why tempt fate ? You just did . - Where are you going ? - where do you think I am going ... you won 't show me where it is so I have to find it for myself . Oh and about yesterday ? The best part ... was finding the treasure . The Devil 's triangle , now that ... could explain how any number of civilizations ... came to be here on the plateau . - How so ? - Well like you said , ships have been disappearing in that part of the ocean ... for hundreds of years . Chances are there would be a few survivors . Who 've have gone on to flourish here in this lost world . You know that makes a lot of sense . Hello , what have we here ? There 's smoke in the chimney , must be somebody home . Simple fisherman by the looks of it . One step closer you get a bullet each . - Simple something . - What do you want ? We mean you no harm . I 'm Professor George Challenger and this is my colleague Edward Malone . - We live just across the valley . - So what brings you here ? We wanted to ask you a few questions about the sea . What kind of questions ? Well simple questions about , the tides , currents , weather conditions . Debris that washes up to shore , you know ... pieces of ships , things like that ... objects that fall from the sky ... - What do you know about that ? - Well nothing . We just heard stories ... lots of stories . I like a good story . Why don 't you come inside and tell me all about it . Thank you , but we 're got a lot of ground to cover tonight . - I insist . - It 's been very nice talking to you . Stop right where you are . Drop your weapons and turn around . One should never ignore friendly hospitality . More ! Your wife makes a good cup of tea . At least it smells like a good cup of tea . You 're a very lucky man , to have such a good wife . Tell me more about these things that fall from the sky . Well , there 's not much to tell really . As Malone said just a few stories we picked up here and there , that 's all Native legends myths most likely . Folk tales , oh I get it . Who do you think you 're talking to , Edward Malone ? Born yesterday you think I was ? My name is Wik Pappin ... and my kin have been in this place since 1835 . One could take exception to strangers like ... you making eyes at their wife . Many have died for less . I 'm sure in your little world many ... people have died for absolutely nothing . That 's always the best . Now let 's see what you brought me . What have we here ? That 's nothing , it 's just personal writings . My colleague is a well respected journalist . You think I can 't read , old man . - Where did you get this ? - Don 't tell him anything . Another word from you will be your last . Start talking journalist . We found Bonny 's treasure ... four or five days from here . It 's yours for the taking . - We were just on our way back home . - I warned you ! Wait ! You hurt him and I swear I 'll never tell you where that treasure is . Well see about that . Draw me a map . Well you let us go and we 'll lead you right to it . When I 've got the treasure ... we 'll talk about your future . Immy ? Go get my mates . She 's been out there all day . I can 't believe she hasn 't given up yet . She 's never going to give up . - She 'll just get angrier . - And take it out on us . Exactly . Maybe we should put an end to this . Oh no . We 're not going to tell her anything . You and I made a deal . Which is really going to bring down the curse of Marguerite . - We 're here and ready Wik . - I see that Mister Davey , and you 're about to make some history . As long as there 's blood and screaming I 'm always happy to oblige . There 'll be lots of that and more . You and the men are going treasure hunting . - Are they buying it ? - Looks like it . He 's showing them the map . What are you doing ? Don 't do that ! Oh no . - What ? - He 's ripping it up . That map leads nowhere . But Captain Bonny , braggart that he was , couldn 't help ... describing his perfect little hiding spot . See , he dug a pit . How else could a thieving , backstabbing snake ... just disappear ? Be back tomorrow or I 'll come looking . What are you waiting for let 's get going . Come on . Move it mutt . It 's coming with us . Immy , come here ! What are you up to ? Oh no , you 're not doing what I think you 're doing ? Our secret treasure map . Complete with carefully measured directions . Where are you taking her ? Right back here , empty handed . You think she 'll fall for this ? As determined as she is ? She 'll fall for it in a second . Yeah , well do me a favor and leave me out of it . Our host is obviously a ... descendent of one of the other survivors . They probably all are . They 're not going to be any too pleased ... when they find the treasure 's gone . We should have listened to Roxton and left that treasure right ... where we found it . I 'll have us out of here in a moment . We 'll warn the others . So how 's my new mates . Tiring of your atrocious hospitality . Time for a little walk journalist . - Why ? Is there decks to be swabbed ? - You wish . You are going to be sorry if you try to double cross me ... You 're not going to get away with this . Enjoy what little time you have left , old man ... you 're next . Don 't worry about me . At least one of us will get out of here . The fun and games are over . If a bunch of savages makes off with my treasure ... you will wish you had never met me . Marguerite I promise you no one 's going to find it . We hid it very well . When Challenger and Malone get back ... the odds will once again be in my favor ... and you will have to abandon your little coup . Maybe , maybe not . If we can convince one of them to change their mind ... Don 't even think about it . We 'll talk more about it when they get back . Aha ! What 's this , a map ? Oh brilliant . Is this real or not ? I ... No , it 's Veronica 's idea of a little fun . - I don 't believe you . - Why would I lie ? Only one reason , to hide the truth . Marguerite you 're wasting time the map leads you right back here . You couldn 't lie to save your life . What did I tell you ? What part of ' leave me out of it ' didn 't you understand ? I 've got to find Malone . A lot of people are going to die for this . What do you see ? Somebody took the bloody treasure . Come here you mongrel . Come on . Go find Bonny 's heart and soul . 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 . Turn left at the big rock . What big rock ? Well I get it . Let 's have a little fun with Marguerite , shall we ? Wait till I get my hands on you two . Here she is , Captain 's treasure . What 's taking you so so long ? Come on . Put your backs into it . He who laughs last , Captain Bonny . Laughs loudest of all . Drop your weapons , back away , now . And who the hell might you be , pretty lady ? Put it down . That 's my treasure , I buried it there for safekeeping . No kidding , you going to shoot us all ? - If I have to , you first . - I 'm flattered . Right here in the heart , you can 't miss . I knew this was a bad idea . One more , you die . Get your hands off me ! Far too late for that , my lady . So , what 's a pretty lady like you ... doing all alone in the jungle ? Who said I 'm alone ? My friends should be here any minute . - How many friends you got ? - More than you I 'm sure . The more the merrier but I don 't believe you . Pirates ? Captain Bonny 's curse . You take the big one . Why do you think we 're here ? We 're not here to pick flowers . Hey ! Come on ! Very impressive ladies . Now who are you ? The treasure belongs to us . We want it back . Then start hauling . You 're just going to leave me here to die ? Won 't take too long once the tide start rolling in . This cave fills up like a tankard of ale . Reckon you 've got about five or six hours . That 's probably more than you have . How do you figure that ? My colleague and I are part of a larger expedition , thirty two men , a military expedition . Aha , Your new friends had some good stories too . Malone ? Where the hell are you ? Just what I need . Out of the pan and into the fire . Sure you 'll be all right alone with this character ? You should be asking him that , not me . Get over there . My mates will be coming back you can bet your lives on that . Wik Pappin will be coming with them . We 're hoping to meet your boss half way . And you had better hope he 's smarter than you ... and knows when to cut his losses . And if he 's hurt our friends , you 're the one who better worry . You don 't scare me . Don 't I ? Are you really going to offer him the entire treasure ? Yes , if that 's what it takes to secure the release of Malone and Challenger . We only brought it here for safekeeping Marguerite . - Stay away from him . - Be careful . If you say one word that I find distasteful or offensive , I will not hesitate to correct your grammar . What 's the matter , journalist running out of stories ? Ever wonder why your wife ran out on you ? You 're nothing but a bully and a coward . She didn 't run away . She 's just hiding until I sober up . If she really tried to run away I 'd kill her . If she gets away I 'll just grab another from the nearest village . I hope you rot in hell . Yep , well hell 's warmer than this place , that 's for sure . Some of the others died singing , give that a try . What happened ? Where is it ? Where 's Davey where 's the treasure ? Ambushed ... we were outnumbered . You idiot . Malone , Challenger anybody home ? That 's two of them there . Wik Pappin come on out . A little bit of trouble and a good looking blonde . - Anybody home or an ambush ? - Only one way to find out . It looks like they might have escaped . Hey , you inside ! Ah , It looks like the little pirate is home . - That 's close enough Pappin ! - You know my name ! How about my reputation for killing nosy strangers ? That was a good one . Put down your guns and we 'll talk this out ! What do we have to talk about ? The treasure ! That is , if you 're still interested ? I was on my way to get it now ! Let our friends go and we 'll give it back to you ! Oh and by the way , we 're holding one of your men as well ! Too bad for him ! And too bad for you ! Last chance ! Get out of my shack ! Put down your guns and I 'll be happy to come out and talk . - Get it . - Come on ! Talk about this . I wonder where they 're going ? What has he done with Malone and Challenger ? They must have escaped . I say he 's been out there looking for them . Oh my God . I 've been saving this for something special . What do we do now ? Gunpowder ? All right , fight fire with fire . We need to create a diversion . Start punching a hole at the back of the wall . Nothing left to say in there ? Faster ! - You ready ? - Whenever you are . Go ! What the hell are you doin ' ? Must be in the water . The explosion must have got ' em ' . They have to come up for air . Ehhh , the hell with them . Lets go get the treasure . I didn 't know I could hold my breath that long . Nor I. We better find Malone and Challenger . Better get back to the tree house Marguerite 's all alone . You 're as greedy as Captain Bonny . Captain Bonny stole this treasure ... I found it . In the eyes of the law , that makes all the difference . There 's plenty to go around for all of us . I really don 't think so , you see I have expenses . I know what I appear to be . I can be kind and generous . You struck me as the complex type . I 'm nothing compared to Captain Bonny . He was the worst cut throating pirate you 've ever seen . Why ? Because he ended up with all the stolen treasure ? Because he killed his mates to get it . Captain Bonny almost drowned but one of his mates saved him . Nine of them made it to the shore and Bonny slit ... all of their throats one by one ... and kept the treasure for himself . You mean before anybody else could do it . Yeah , something like that , except he didn 't quite kill one of them ... his first mate Seymour Pappin . Oh . Ancestor of your hallowed leader . Ancestor of us all . Never found the treasure but sired a whole new tribe . What ? Looks like he didn 't do a very good job of that either . Loosen these straps and I 'll show you how ... Remember what I said about your grammar . Sorry miss . I meant no disrespect . Good , you 're a fast learner . I 'll have to think of some way to reward you . It can 't end like this . Immy help me . - I 'll take you back to your village . - I can 't . - He 'll kill me . - Immy , don 't be afraid . I have friends who can help you . I won 't let him hurt you I swear . That 's it . Now give me the knife . I can 't swim . The knife ! No ! Come on ! Immy . I won 't let you die . - Thank you . - No , thank you , you did it . Now go back to your village . We 'll take care of Pappin . All in good time my friend , first things first . What the hell is this ? Spread out ! There must be a way in somewhere . Anybody home up there ? I want my treasure ! It 's about bloody time your king showed up . Do you hear me up there , send down my treasure ! No need to blabber like a beached whale , I hear you . Last chance , send down my treasure ... or I 'm coming up to get it . Jeez , I 'd like to see that . all right ... all right ... hate to put you to all that trouble ! - Hey , it 's no trouble at all . - Just give me a minute ... and I 'll send it down with your cousin . Oh no . I really hate raptors . - Challenger ? - Malone ? - In here ! - I 'll try and lead it away . Be careful ! Too late for that . That 's a magnificent throw Malone . Veronica would be very proud of you . I got it . I got the treasure . The current 's turned off . Take your accursed treasure and leave us alone . A pleasure doing business with you ma 'am . Sometimes it 's just too easy . Oh no . Move away . Roxton ! Veronica ! Let them have it ! I only want what we deserve . That 's exactly what I 'm gonna give you . Tell your friend to drop his weapon . Ah , my leg ! Time to taste some of my hospitality old man . Do I finally have your attention ? Too little too late Marguerite , I believe we have these scoundrels well at hand . No you don 't . I gave you the bloody treasure , just take it and go . Now wait just a minute Marguerite . No Captain Bonny was right . The treasures cursed , I don 't want any part of it . How 'd you like to be a rich man 's wife . And maybe you 'd like to be buried next to the Captain . Ah , you 're a loser born and bred . Come on ! Well it was what you wanted wasn 't it ? Okay Marguerite , you win . I usually do . Seriously , if this were one of my stories , even I couldn 't convince the reader that you gave up a fortune , just like that . Unless you honestly believe that treasure was cursed . Oh George , not a chance . So there 's only one other ... possible , explanation . And that would be ? Aren 't you hot with that scarf around your neck ? Well Lord Roxton , is there any detail that escapes your eye ? Well , well , well , so , my dear , where 's the rest of the treasure ? All right put it down . It will be easier to carry once we fill our pockets . Marguerite you didn 't ! You did say it was cursed , remember ? Oh ! Captain Marguerite , the most feared and elegant pirate around . The scourge of the plateau . Which brings us back to the question ... – where 's the rest of the treasure ? - Oh , it 's perfectly safe . Now only I know where it is .

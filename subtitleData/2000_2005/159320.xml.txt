 Love and Rocket You are one narrow-minded spaceship , Planet Express Ship ! MALE VOICE : Whoa . Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive ? Would you censor the Venus De Venus just because you can see her spewers ? It 's filthy ! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs ... - ... while we 're at it ? - Why not , indeed ! Bender , Ship ! Stop bickering or I 'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually ! Fine ! I 'll be in my quarters , appreciating controversial artworks . SHIP : Oops . Sorry . That Ship is so white bread . People . It 's Valentine 's Day next week . So your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms . - Cool ! - Clothing . Delicious clothing . We 'll need to look our best to get the account ... ... of our new potential customer , Romanticorp . Romanticorp ? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff ? Very good , Amy . Everyone suit up . We 're off to the most romantic city on Earth . [ SMOOCHES ] Remember , we 've got to show these people ... ... we 're not bitter husks of human beings ... ... who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime . - Leela , you 'll have to do some acting . - Check . Welcome . Oh , I 'm just so excited . I 'm Sheldon , and this is my chief financial officer , Gwen . For 30 years , we 've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp . Not to mention the adventure of marriage . Oh , you have got to be kidding . Ow ! I mean , that 's so sweet . I mean , that 's sho shweet . You know , romance is an important part of our work too . - Right , everyone ? GROUP : Yeah . Sure . - Do any of you collect Lovey Bears ? - I do . Kif 's given me dozens . Is it true what the ad says ? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons ? - No . - It 's actually cheaper ... ... to genetically engineer real ones . [ BEARS LAUGHING ] They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday . Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones ... ... and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff . So cute ! Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle ... ... keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology . Is heaven missing an angel ? Because you 've got nice cans . My two favorite things are commitment and changing myself . Does that dummy have a brother ? And now , friends and lovers , we come to the heart of our operation . Pun definitely intended . Impressive . My family has been making these hearts since the 1 900s . Tastes may have changed , but our secret recipe sure hasn 't . Letter 's like U and R can mean words like " you " and " are . " - Here , Leela . " U-R-2 cute . " - Perhaps . What 's your point ? I 've never been able to put into words how I feel about you . But somewhere among these trillions of hearts , those words must already exist . And I 'm gonna find them . [ GUN FIRING ] [ BEAR LAUGHING ] Oh ... . So do we have the contract ? With that big , new Romanticorp contract ... ... I 've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades ... ... you 've all been suing me about . Look . You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor . And you got a cage for the lion . [ LION GROWLS ] [ SPIN DOCTORS' " TWO PRINCES " PLAYS ] Who 's been messing with the radio ? This isn 't alternative rock . It 's college rock . It must have been the new , improved ship 's personality software I installed . SHIP : Yeah , it was me . It 's a cute song . - Listen , Ship ! No one changes my stations ! I hope you have a good mechanic ! It even comes with an adjustable voice . We each get one of the four buttons . FEMALE VOICE : Remember , Bender ? That was the deal . [ LAUGHS ] What ? Did you just say : [ MIMICS SHIP 'S LAUGHTER ] If you don 't like the stations , play with my buttons ... ... till you find something we both enjoy . [ PURRS ] - Oh , gosh . That came out all wrong . - Too late , baby . You said it . So , what will it be ? My place ? Or you ? Before we deliver these hearts ... ... I 'm gonna find one that sums up my feelings for you . " I love you . " Too conventional . " You 're my man . " Oh , so close . I 'm not impressed by a guy 's message , Fry . I 'm impressed by the guy . Or not . [ CRASHING ] - What was that ? - Maybe we hit a space cow . Cootchie-cootchie . [ LAUGHS ] Stop it . You 're mussing up my trajectory . - You know you love it , sugar engine . SHIP : No ! Bender ! What 's going on in here ? Planet Express Ship ! Cover your shame ! Oh . It 's not what it looks like . Bender was just helping me zip up my turbine . Wow , Bender . Are you and the ship an item ? I mean , I know you 're both items , but how can you date a ship , anyway ? It 'd be like me dating a really fat lady and living inside her . And she 'd be all like : [ MIMICS SPACESHIP ] Fry , in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency ... ... I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty . Bender , dating your coworker and primary mode of transportation ... ... is immoral , illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B . That 's what makes it so nasty . Still , given the chance , I 'd give in to urges far more shocking . [ MOANING ] [ BENDER SINGS " BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO " ] - Well , I 'm sick of her . - The ship ? But you just started dating . With my mighty robot powers , I can get sick of things ... ... much quicker than you humans . Just remember , we all still have to work together . - So try and let her down easy . - In due time , Leela . But for now , I 'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side . You have much to teach us . Doesn 't it bother you a little ... ... to be taking advantage of your girlfriend 's trust ? Oh , wait , you 're serious . Let me laugh even harder . What 's it like being a lawyer for the mayor 's office ... ... and also the world 's strongest millionaire ? Well , baby , for starters , you need to be honest all the time . Good evening , Bender . And to your lady friends , may I say , " Bam . " You know Elzar ? Hm . [ DOORBELL RINGS ] Huh ? - Planet Express Ship ? ls that you ? SHIP : Oh , hi , Fry . - Is Bender home ? - No . I think he 's at his parents . SHIP : Oh , I see . He didn 't fly there in another spaceship , did he ? Bender ? No . He 's an old-fashioned , one-spaceship robot . - Look , I 'll tell him you stopped by , okay ? SHIP : Okay . [ DOORBELL RINGS ] SHIP : Oh , hi , Fry . Is he home now ? SHIP : Of all the zoos we 've been to today , I like this one the best . Bender , which is your favorite nocturnal rat ? - They 're all pretty unimpressive . SHIP : Oh , honey , look ! The tapirs ! [ GROANS ] SHIP : It says here the babies lose their pajama-like coat after their first year . - Isn 't that interesting , honey ? - Yep . Mind-numbingly interesting . Whoa . SHIP : Bender ! Are you looking at other women ? No , baby , never ! SHIP : Bender ! Don 't lie ! I saw you at Elzar 's with those two ladies of the evening ! - Explain that ! - Okay . I like a challenge . No . No . I got it . I 'm going to be completely honest with you , Planet Express Ship . Those women you saw me with were my accountants . SHIP : Your accountants ? I would dearly love to believe that were true . So I do . Phew . SHIP : I 'm gonna go home and get dinner started . - Who were you talking to ? - No one , baby . - Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender . - I love you- - [ SHIP SIGHS ] Planet Express Ship , is something wrong ? Oh , it 's Bender . He 's acting so strange lately . Do you think he 's gonna ask me to marry him ? Uh , no . Somebody knows something she 's not telling . Look . I 'm not saying Bender 's not great ... ... but have you ever considered that maybe he 's , you know , not that great ? You 're just jealous . No one loves you , because you 're tiny and made of meat . [ GASPS ] Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids ? Sorry , Capt. Leela . I guess I 'm just having one of those manic Mondays . [ LAUGHING ] This is ancient Earth 's most foolish program . Why does Ross , the largest friend , not simply eat the other five ? Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps . Exalted leaders , the Earth messengers have arrived ... ... bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government . Oh , very well . This is a Joey-heavy episode anyway . I am Lrrr , of the planet Omicron Persei 8 . " Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8 . Please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you ... ... this much . " Ugh ! These candies are chalky and unpleasant ! And what is this emotion you humans call " wuv " ? - Surely it says " Iove . " - No . " Wuv , " with an Earth W ! Behold ! This concept of " wuv " confuses and infuriates us ! Incoming torpedoes . Shields at maximum yarnell . Steady , Planet Express Ship . Focus on diverting all power to the scram jets . Look , Planet Express Ship , this might not be the best time ... ... but , well , I really like you and whatever ... ... but I think we should just be friends . SHIP : No ! So we 're cool ? [ SHIP CRYING ] Well , it was a spectacular battle . But there doesn 't seem to be any permanent damage . No damage ? What about my feelings ? Aw . Calm down . I 'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are . Bender is great Oh , Bender is great You could 've picked a better time to dump the ship . The moment seemed right . Call me old-fashioned , but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating . [ SHIP CRYING ] I know . I know . Look , Ship . If I learned one thing from my breakup with Shawn that was totally mutual ... ... it 's that happiness can only come from within you . But Bender is within me ! There must be some way to make him love me again . Trust me . You can 't change men ... ... any more than you can change the laws of time and space . That is so true . [ RUMBLING ] I may not be able to change the laws of time and space ... ... but I know something that can . [ GRUNTING ] Sweetie ? You see that giant quasar we 're heading into ? You might want to scooch a few parsecs to the left . I 'm afraid I can 't do that , Leela . What 's happening ? Space cow ? The ship 's just taking the breakup a little hard . She 's nuts ! In a few moments , the power of 1 0 billion black holes ... ... will smoosh Bender and me together ... ... into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity . [ SCREAMING ] You don 't need to kill us , Planet Express Ship . Because I love you ! Yeah , baby ! Feel like doing stuff for you and stuff . Hm . I don 't believe you . If you really wanted to be with me ... ... you 'd merge your programming with mine . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Slow down . My friends who 've done that ... ... say that afterwards , all the passion went out of their relationship . - I don 't know if you want my opinion- - - Leela . Bender and I really need to be alone , so I 'm turning off the oxygen . [ COUGHING AND CHOKING ] Look , missy . If you don 't turn around now ... ... I 'm gonna have to shut down your brain ! Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela . - That barely hurt Leela at all . - Maybe not . But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction ? BENDER : Float for your lives ! This is the one place she can 't hear us . Just pretend to shower . - Same as every day . Got it . - Now here 's the plan . Oh , if only I could read lips . Comprende , Bender ? You 'll have to distract her . Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain . It 's too risky . I 'm a very meek individual . If her personality engulfs mine , the Bender you know and worship ... ... could disappear forever . I 'm willing to take that risk . Hey , pookums . Contrary to what I was saying earlier ... ... melding minds with you would be extremely bearable . You really mean it ? Uh , yes . [ BEEPING ] [ BENDER GROANING ] Huh ? Hey ? Tubes ? ! You 're older than you said you were ! Come closer , Bender . Let 's become one . I prefer two . That way we can still be a horse for Halloween . [ WHIMPERS ] Okay , Bender has her distracted . Now I can shut down her brain ... ... by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix . Oh . I can 't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face . I 'm on it . Maybe I 'll find those magic words while I 'm at it . LEELA : Fat chance . - Yeah , I know . [ GROANS ] - Oh . How about this one ? - Give it up , Fry ! I 've got to pop these tops in a precise order . Halfway there . The ship should be getting a bit less rational now . - Me want engulf Bender ! BENDER : No ! I didn 't do it ! Only a few more . Hey , I won free admission to Six Flags ! Just one more reason we must survive this . - Leela ? - Fry , I 'll read your candy later . When we 're not dead ! [ BEEPING ] - What was that ? - Oh , nothing . We 're gonna love being each other , you sexy ion . [ YELLS ] Last one . [ ALARM WAILING ] [ SHIP BRAKES ] It worked ! Gravity normal . Air returning . Terror replaced by cautious optimism . We did it , Fry ! Fry ? [ GASPS ] You gave me your oxygen ? Oh , no ! Breathe , Fry ! Breathe ! [ COUGHING ] Oh ... . " You leave me breathless " ? ! - Happy Valentine 's Day , Fry . - Happy Valentine 's Day . Bender , are you okay ? What crazy thing am I gonna date next ? It sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers . Of course . Bender is a lone wolf . A solitary eagle . FEMALE VOICE : A cuddly baby tapir . BENDER 'S VOICE : And that 's why I love him . I guess we 'd better clean up these millions of hearts . No . I 've got a lazier idea . ZOIDBERG : As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar a wondrous thing happened , why not ? They vaporized into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe , destroying many , many planets including two gangster planets and a cowboy world . But one planet was exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays but not be destroyed by them . Earth . So all over the world , couples stood together in joy . And me , Zoidberg . No one could have been happier , unless it would have also been Valentine 's Day . What ? It was ? Hooray !

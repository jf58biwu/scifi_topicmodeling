 NARRATOR : Futurama is brought to you by Thompson ' s Teeth the only teeth strong enough to eat other teeth . Insane in the Mainframe Good news , everyone . Today marks our friend Dr. Zoidberg 's 10th year with Planet Express . - Huzzahs are in order . - Huzzah . - Hooray for me ! Hooray for Zoidberg ! - I 'll now read the mandatory speech . " Dear Employee : Has it really been 5 , 10 or 15 years ? If not , disregard this and get to work . " Distribute token of appreciation and applaud . Look ! Coupons ! I can get two oil changes for the price of one ! Now if I could only afford the one . And the car . Ah , the years . So many memories so many strange fluids gushing out of patients ' bodies . HERMES : Yes , yes . Now here 's your pension statement . It 's empty because you haven 't paid into it , you dummy . You kept track of it all these years . I 'm boned . I haven 't paid either . What 'll I do when I retire ? - I thought you were retired . - I don 't see you planning for old age . I got plans . I 'm gonna turn my on / off switch to off . I 'm gonna take action . It 's time to check my retirement fund . Damn ! Still only 100 dollars . A penny saved is a penny earned . Also , I need athlete 's foot cream for my face . He 's right . I must start investing wisely . Well , down to my last lottery ticket . Cherry . Cherry ! Mule . Crud ! You got six bucks left to retire on . I recommend Tender Vittles . You 're opening a retirement account for $ 6 ? I 'm sure a wealthy mule farmer like you knows we charge a $ 10 monthly fee . You gotta spend money to make money . Here you are . Your account is now overdrawn by $ 4 . I 've seen lines move faster in the sperm bank . That 's for sure ... Roberto , is that you ? Bender ! Hey , man ! [ LAUGHING ] - You old lunatic ! How you been ? - Not bad . Not bad . Everybody on the floor ! This is a stickup ! I 'm okay too . I 'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex . - Cool . Can you give me a hand here ? - Sure thing , pal . Hey , you ! Red ! Quit watering that plant and get the door ! - Nice talking to you . - Same here . You guys are all right . - Here 's something for your trouble . - Thanks , buddy ! Freeze ! You 're under arrest ! Shoot them in the back ! Quick , while they 're not looking ! Court is in session . The Honorable Judge Whitey presiding . The charge is bank robbery . My caddie-chauffeur informs me that a bank is where people put money that isn 't invested right . Therefore , robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes : Theft of money . As the surveillance camera for that bank the judge was jawing about could you tell us what you done seen that day ? Well , let 's see . My memory 's a little fuzzy , but it went exactly like this : Your Honor , I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients . Mr. Fry , do you recognize the robot hugging on you in this here hologram ? I sure do ! That 's the real robber and I 'll never forget his name as long as I live . And that name is ... [ COUGHS ] Just give a name ! You don 't wanna look stupid on Court TV . You 're right . You 're right . It was ... [ PHONE RINGS ] Yes ? What ? You say if I testify I 'll be killed ? Oh , it 's for you . And the other hamburger will also be made of your lungs . So long , pal . I won 't testify on grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty . The 67th Amendment . I may be a simple , country chicken , but I know when we 're finger-licked . What if we plead insanity ? A few months in an insane asylum ? I could do it on my head . If you start now , it might help our case . What evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity ? - They done hired me to represent them . - Insanity plea is accepted . Mr. Bender , I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until you are deemed cured . Yahoo ! The system fails again ! And Mr. Fry , I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans . That facility has been full since you ruled being poor is a mental illness . Order ! The only poor people I want to hear about are those who tend to my pores at the spa . Send them both to the robot loony bin and let 's go . FRY : Huh ? Ow , my head ! Ow , my feet ! Ow , my head ! Ow , my feet ! - Keep your chin up . FRY : Ow , my chin ! I don 't belong here . This is for insane robots . Well , you meet half the qualifications . Oh , good ! A physical ! Once they examine my fragile , pink body , they 'll see I 'm not a ... [ FRY SCREAMS ] Whee ! [ GROANS ] [ SINGS ] What the ... ? [ BELCHES ] BENDER : I find that offensive ! Greetings . I am Dr. Perceptron . Let me give you something to help you relax . There 's been a terrible mistake ! I 'm human ! See ? I 'm all squishy and flabby . Also , I complain a lot . Yes , you do . You need to relax more . Terrific . Now , consider the following : You were admitted to this robot asylum . You must be a robot . Diagnosis complete . I do other human stuff . I age ! See ? I 'm Nurse Ratchet . Please come with me , won 't you ? We 'll meet your roommate next . His name is Malfunctioning Eddie . The car dealer ? I guess his prices really were insane . He 's very excitable , so don 't say anything to surprise him . - Pleased to meet you . - We 've met . What ? ! I 'm a pretty girl . I 'm a pretty girl . I 'm a pretty girl . - Someone had a busy day ! - My roommate exploded . You gotta help me . How can I prove I 'm human ? - You could drop dead . - I don 't wanna ! UNIT 2013 : Hey . I believe you are a human . You do ? They don 't believe I 'm a human either . Name 's Unit 2013 . Let me introduce you around . Fry , meet Norm . Still picking up CIA transmissions on your teeth ? They just won 't stop ! WOMAN : The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows : Monday , shepherd 's pie ... Cuckoo . - Let me guess . He thinks he 's Lincoln ? - He 's supposed to . Problem is , he 's got multiple personalities . All of them Lincoln . I was born in 200 log cabins . UNIT 2013 : And this here is Frankie . He thinks he 's a lunchroom worker . So they put him here . - How 's working the lunchroom ? - All right . Poor Frankie . Change places ! I can 't take much more of this . I want out of here ! Are you crazy ? This is great . Electroshock whenever you want two Lincolns for every Napoleon . Sweet light crude ! But I 'm not a robot ! I don 't like having disks crammed into me . Unless they 're Oreos , and only in the mouth . Don 't you see ? I 'll die ! Quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot . MAD HATTER : Change places ! They say you 're making strides with your exploding problem . Well , the way I see it ... Get me out . I 'd have starved if not for that sick vending machine robot . Give me ! Give me ! Poor Fry . He 's got the munchies for freedom . We 're trying . We petitioned the governor but he doesn 't want to appear soft on those falsely imprisoned . At least I have friends on the outside . Bender 's been no help at all . Je sui Napol ? On ! No , seriously , I 'm not . You should be more ashamed than usual . Lighten up , honey . I 'm getting through a difficult time using humor . Visiting hours are over . Time for our medication disks . Help me ! For God 's sake , help me ! Don 't worry , Fry . I too once spent a nightmarish time in a robot asylum . But now it 's nearly over . So long . Thirty days , September , April , June . Peanut butter . What am I gonna do ? [ WHIRRING ] Oh , God ! What ? What ? What is it now ? - You are being released . - Finally ! Sweet justice ! Sweet , juicy justice ! - Not you . Him . - Me ? What a surprise ! - Look ! I barely exploded at all . - We can control that with medication . Fry ? Are we ready to meet our new roommate ? - Hi , Red ! - Roberto ? What are you doing here ? - I got busted robbing that bank again . - Why the same bank twice ? That first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little . - What 's the matter ? You scared ? - N ... , n ... , n ... Noticeably ? I 'll say . Now stand back . I gotta practice my stabbing . No ! Please ! Help ! Stop it ! Police ! [ POUNDING ] BENDER : Hey , keep it down in there ! I 'm tuning my banjo ! Jeez , Red . Quit cowering . You call yourself a robot ? I 'm not a robot ! I 'm not a robot ! In answer to your question , Hermes , yes , your friend is cured . Oh ! Thank God ! Notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity . Affirmative . I feel nothing . I am a robot . Beep , beep , beep ... You 've made a terrible mistake . He 's a human being . Not a machine ! Oh , Fry ! Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep ... Gonna sing a little tale About a battle called Waterloo Bonjour , y 'all ! Fry , just because you think you 're a robot doesn 't make you one . I think I 'm a doctor , but that doesn 't make me a doctor . These clothes do . I must be a robot . Why else would human women not date me ? Oh , lots of reasons . Terminate noise exchange . It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment . Here we go . Just a minute . ANNOUNCER : And down the stretch , it 's Daddy 's Little Grandpa followed by Perennial Loser . Bringing up the rear , it 's Lasty ! - Come on , Lasty ! ROBERTO : Hey , Bender . Roberto ! What a surprise to see you in here ! Especially because I didn 't squeal . Remember , I didn 't squeal ? Do you ? Yeah . Now lie down and play dead . And don 't ham it up . Sure . Anything for you , buddy . Wait here , Bender . I need to get a disguise . [ CLATTERING ] What 's with the getup ? I 'm in disguise ' cause I wanna escape . You in ? Or do I gotta kill you ? I 'm in ! I 'm in ! When were you planning the breakout ? I 'm thinking , a few seconds ago . [ SIREN WAILS ] Quick ! Let 's keep escaping ! Times two . Carry the one . Oh , you sad , worthless human . That was my anniversary gift from LaBarbra ! - Fear not , for I shall assist ye ! - Robots don 't say " ye . " Relax , mammal . My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs . What is this symbol ? That 's a plus sign , you loony ! Quit thinking you 're a robot ! I 'll show ye . Stand back ! I 'm a tool-bot . You 're not a tool-bot or a food-mo-tron . You 're not a robot of any kind . Yes , I am . I simply haven 't discovered my primary function yet . Okay . This has got to stop . I 'll remind Fry of his humanity , the way only a woman can . You 're going to do his laundry ? Fry , this is for you . - Beep . - Oh , for God 's sake ! By a scallop 's forelocks , what 's with all the beer ? Alcohol fuels my power cells . And , as a mighty robot , I ... Beep . [ SNORES ] - Thanks for helping me escape . - It was nothing . It was not nothing ! I want to repay you . Let me get you something in here . Hands up ! This is a stickup again ! Wow . Hitting the same place three times ? I admire your style . Give me the remaining dough , the calendars and that pen . Tear it so most of the beads are on my end ! Police . You 're busted ! And don 't try anything . This glass is laser-proof . Fire lasers ! Duck ! Lasers ! Come on ! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes . He looks like a little insane drunken angel . Hey , everybody . Meet my good pal , Roberto . - Hey , mon . - Nice to meet you . COP : Come out with your hands up ! - Hostages ! - Back off ! I got hostages ! - Hooray ! I 'm helping ! Do you have any better hostages ? To show them who 's crazy , I 'll execute some of you . You ? Ouch ! That 's going to bleed when my heart beats . - Wait ! Take me first ! - Yes ! Take her first ! Shut up ! Stop telling me how to do this ! ZOIDBERG : Oh , the fear ! I 'm thinking of a number between one and 10 . Guess it , and you die first . - Go ! - Okay . - Fifty-six-ish ? - Fifty-six ? Fifty-six ? Man ! Now that 's all I can think about ! I 'm gonna kill you , you no good , 56-ing ... ! Don 't kill me ! I 'm coming down with Stockholm Syndrome handsome . Halt , fellow robot ! Hey , Red ! You 're just in time to join the hostage situation . - Which side do you want to be on ? - The side that kicks your metal ass . Fry ! Stay back ! He 's too powerful ! Negative , bossy meat creature . I now know my primary function : I am a battle-droid , protecting the weak from crazy robots . I 'm not crazy ! Don 't call me crazy ! I 'm just not user-friendly . Don 't be a hero ! It 's not covered by the health plan ! Let 's see how much of a robot you really are ! No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armor . Help ! Help ! He is a battle-droid ! Somebody help me ! Mommy ! I 'm sorry I spilled the transmission fluid , Mommy . No , no ! Don 't weld me to the wall , Mommy ! We 're willing to listen to your demands . Hey , baby . Wash that off before you put it back . AMY : Hooray ! ZOIDBERG : Bravo ! You did it , Fry . Congratulations , buddy . You 're a credit to my race . It was nothing . L ... Blood ? Robots don 't have blood . I must be a ... - A squid ? - A human ! Oh , my God ! I 'm a human ! Also good . Thanks for saving us , Fry . I 'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again . You may be wrapped in greasy skin , but inside you have the heart of a robot . Thanks , Bender . Just like inside me , I 've got the heart of a human . What ? What ?

 Japan belongs to the People ! not the military ! Long live the People ! The Black Dragon Clan is coming ! Kick the Chinese out of the school ! Maintenance is important . Do not allow the fluid to enter the reservoir nor the engine . The function of the pump is only then maintained . And never try to repair it without the help of an engineer . Stop writing ! All Chinese get out of here ! You can 't enter here ! This school is not for Chinese people ! Get out now ! Behave yourself here ! Are you alright ? Rotten scum ! What do you think you 're doing ! Who are you to speak to me ? Yamada Mitsuko . The one who looks down at you ! Chicken ! I don 't care who you are . you better disappear . One ! Two ! Three ! Master ... He is Funakoshi Fumio Master of the Black Dragon Clan . Have you already given up fighting ? Violence is no solution . Now you see the result . Didn 't you learn anything in my school ? Professor Watanabe . Excuse my pupils . Be thankful for his mercy . You could all be crippled if he wanted you to be . Who did you fight with ? Me . You alone ? Your Kung Fu is quite efficient . I am Funakoshi Fumio from the Black Dragon Clan . And you ? why are you here ? my pen has been broken by your pupils ! It was very expensive ! You know I am poor . Why tell me about it ? Do you guys have some money ? Satisfied ? Just like your blessed father . Impossible to satisfy . Don 't you worry nobody will marry you ? No problem at all . Chen Zhen is all I want . Chen Zhen ? Yes . Chen Zhen of Jing Wu School . Jing Wu School of Shanghai ? - That means Huo Yuen-jia ... - Is my Master . Impressive ... Is there a problem ? I just received ... a telegram from Shanghai . It says that Master Huo was killed in a Kung Fu match by ... his opponent Akutagawa Ryuichi of Nijiguchi . He is from our clan . lmpossible ! I am verry sorry . But this is what I was told . Excuse me . Too bad I missed the opportunity to challenge him myself . Chen Zhen ! Where are you going ? Chinese embassy . To check if this is really true . A Japanese could never have beaten your Master . Stop the Japanese invasion ! Long live the People ! Long live the People ! I warn you ! If you stay too long I will look for someone else . Chen Zhen ! Are you coming back to Japan ? I will come back to Japan . They are only going to Tsingtao to fight the Germans . because Tsingtao belongs to China . Both Japanese and Germans are invaders to China . Chen Zhen Do you hate the Japanese ? I don 't know ! we have no choice . Take care of yourself . Chen Zhen ! JAPAN AND UNITED KINGODM FORM ALLIANCE KARATE MASTER AKUTAGAWA MATCHED WITH MASTER HUO Some small change ! I don 't have anymore . I really don 't have more . I don 't have anymore . Go away ! - Good Morning . - I am not Japanese . You are not ? Me neither ! Please sit down . - Where shall I take you ? - Jing Wu School . Jingwu School ? To learn Kung Fu ? I want to learn Kung Fu . Please go ! Don 't go to Jingwu . but this is over . If you don 't wanna take me there I will take another drive . I will take you anywhere you want . Attention . Let 's go . JING WU SCHOOL Now that Master Huo is dead there is no future for Jingwu School . Are you sure you don 't want to try another school ? They are really finished . 5th Senior ! - Are you the 5th Senior ? - Biu ! - Let me take this . - Thanks . - You are ... - Chen Zhen of Jingwu School . Jingwu School is not finished . Wait and see . What are you waiting for ? 5th Senior ! 5th Senior ! Master Ngai . This is my ancestral tablet . If you want a challenge let 's go outside . are you alright ? Master Ngai . Thank you for the fight . I am no match for you . The victory was unjustified . You must be tired from your journey . Come later for a rematch ! Have you finished your studies ? i am happy you are back . Uncle Nong . I was worried that this might affect your studies ... so I did not notify you about Master . How did you hear about it ? It was all over the newspapers . The Japs must be very happy about it . Well ... Let 's pay our respects to my Father . Wait ! What are you doing ? He is not a Huo . He is not allowed to wear this . Uncle Nong . He was brought up by my father . He is a part of the family . father 's asthma was already getting worse . but of course he would not listen . TOLERANCE Please go ahead ! What are you doing ? Master Huo personally made this board ! Uncle Nong Chen Zhen is right . Foreigners have been doing whatever they wanted to do in our country . That 's because we have tolerated them doing it . As long as I live we won 't tolerate it anymore ! I will look for Akutagawa . Chen Zhen . You must make a challenge first . Forget about it . I will go now . Not even our police can enter Nijiguchi . what will become of the Jing Wu school ? - Even your father could not beat him . - Uncle Nong ... Your father left you in my care . I am responsible for your safety . follow Chen . Notify me if anything happens . - How nice ! Get out ! a phone call ! Who is it ? Yuen-Kui 's speaking ? Nong Jin-Sun . Is it that serious ? I will be there right away . We have to go to the Nijiguchi Area . Two . Three . Four . Idiots ! - You are like girls ! - Dismissed ! Who do you think you are to walk in here with your shoes on ? I am Chen Zhen of Jingwu School . I am looking for Akutagawa Ryuichi . No Chinese are allowed in here ! Get out ! Here is China . I can walk where I want to . Bastard ! I don 't want to fight with you . Get your master out ! This will be a fair duel . there mustn 't be any vengeance ! My master fought you using the Huo Fist . I shall do the same . I can see that you obviously never could have been a match for my master . Master ! Nobody is allowed to enter except Japanese ! Are you sure you saw him enter ? I saw him go in there myself ! There he is ! Are you Japanese ? No . Salute ! - What is going on ? - Nothing ! Mr. Ambassador ... Everything is ok . Don 't create an incident ! Patrol one . Fall in ! how was the match ? - I won . Bravo ! Ask Ting-En and Uncle Nong to join me at Master 's grave . - It hasn 't beensealed yet . - That 's even better . Be careful . What are you doing ? - What are they doing ? - Examining the body of Master . Why did you let them do it ? What can I do ? Chen is a student of the Jing Wu School . tell me why are you doing this to my father ? Akutagawa could never have beaten Master . I suspect he was poisoned . have you ever suspected anything ? Master Huo was hit by his opponent and vomitted blood . Lots of people saw it . Nothing suspicious . I rather want to be called disloyal and disrespectful than not to know the truth . I must find out the truth at any cost . you better kill me right now . But who did it ? That is for you to find out ! Come on everbody . Let us bury Master with the respect he deserves . The Japs could never have beaten Master so easily . They will get what they deserve now ! Luckily 5th Senior came back in time ! I don 't understand ... how did they poison Master ? For some people it is not very hard to do it .. Master prepared this fight for a whole month . He did never get out ! That 's right . The bad guy must be among us ! Hsiao-Wei ! You brought the meals to Master ? why ? Are you suspecting her ? Not really . who else had access to Master 's food ? Me ! I do all the cooking in this house ! Are you suspecting me ? go check the kitchen for poison ! See if there are any dead rats in there ! - Calm down ! - Why don 't you go check ? Go and see if there is anything poisonous in there ! Hurry up ! Go ! don 't get mad ! I must clear my name ! what is going on ? Uncle was suspecting the food was poisoned and Uncle Gun thinks we are accusing him . I never said I was suspecting him ! but not from me ! Master Huo was brought up by my cooking ! And you dare accuse me of poisoning him ? let 's eat ! it might be poisoned . Master has eaten together with all of us . we would all be dead already ! did you hear that ? Suspecting me ! Eat ! so let 's eat before they come ! I will visit Dr. Smith later to see the analysis of the poison that killed Master . Ana ... lysis ? Chemical analysis . JING WU SCHOOL - Have you seen this before ? - No ! - Great ! - Wonderful ! You are incredible . Will you teach us some boxing too ? Sure ! Right now ? Fancy moves not effective . And die-hard training will help . Challenge has one objective : beat the opponent . speed and power ! Simple and direct offense will work best . To attack an opponent ... first learn to take an attack . But we can hit him before they attack ! What if you don 't have enough power ? You can hit him ten times but he will not go down . So you need more power . they have come to learn Kung Fu . Will Chen Zhen be our Master ? we want to learn from him ! I he will not teach you . Ting-En is the Headmaster . - Four-legged form ? - Exact . You look so shaky . Try a kick ! Where is the power ? Let me show you . There is a form of side-kicking in Japanese Kung Fu . Go on . - Simple but effective . - Show us . Get ready . Are you alright ? Concentrate the whole power of the body and kick sharply at the point . HSlAO HUNG - What 's the matter ? - Please stay . It 's late . Stay with me . I am the Head Master now . I must go back . You were afraid of your father . but now you can stay . You can do what you want . If someone sees me here I will lose all respect . I don 't believe it . Who would not respect Master Ting-En ? Please ? Will you stay ? I have to go before dawn . I want to know every move of these people . But they 're all Japanese ! There will always be ignorant idiots who go against history . I am late . Are you still scared of Chen Zhen ? Are you even too weak to knock the door ? that 's why I did not invite you here . I only have one question . Did you hear about the autopsy on Master Huo ? You get out ! What 's this ? Secret affairs ? wasn 't it ? regarding industrial achievement is ahead of China . to break the Chinese Martial Arts Legend . But you have been a big disappointment ! So we had to think of something . Shameless ! It 's only military strategics . This is for military only ! This is no way for a samurai ! The match was to be fair and square ! You shameless bastard made me lose all respect ! You dare to speak of the samurai spirit ? Let me tell you about the samurai spirit ! Justice is secondary ! I will risk becoming a criminal in history . This is wrong . I will show you . According to Dr. Smith Master was poisoned with a slowly growing drug . seeming like an asthmatic disease . Is there a traitor at Jingwu School ? why did you come back ? Why do you ask me ? You have become an idol here at Jingwu School . Did you ever think how Ting-En must feel ? I did not ... have you ever talked with Master Ting-En about the training ? You do what you want here . Can you think once about what you are doing here ? but always bare in mind ... that Ting En is the Head Master of Jingwu School ! It 's getting late . Think about it . going out ? - Yes . Working so hard . Master Chen ! Out here so early in the morning ? I brought some friends with me . They all want to learn from you . Don 't follow me ! Overslept ? Master ! I WILL KILL ALL CRIMINALS . CHEN ZHEN . Hold on ! Violence is no solution ! General ! Move ! Good Morning master ! Where have you been the whole night ? - Where is Chen Zhen ? - He went out . Tell me when he 's back . I am in my room . The Japs are coming . Everyone out ! Little Master ! - The Japanese are here ! - Calm down . Something bad will happen . Call the Police . - What do you want ? - Where is Chen Zhen . Chen Zhen ? He is out . Maybe he went beating some Japs . He has a strange habit . If he does not beat one Jap a day he feels sick . Wait ! you killed Master Akutagawa . You Japs only know how to blame others . Enough talking . We won 't leave without Chen Zhen ! I know you mean business . Close the doors ! Protect Master 's shrine ! Hurry ! - Shoot the Japs ! - Stop that ! Draw your swords . You better leave now ! What ? Just let them go ! Both sides have been injured . This straightens it out . We will not leave until we have Chen Zhen . give me some face . Who are you talking to ? 5th Senior ! Don 't move ! you will not shoot ! I won 't . But my finger could slip ... Shoot the first who moves . Take Chen Zhen away ! Why are you doing this ? Akutagawa was murdered . We must question him . - I did not do it ! - Take him away ! You all better leave now or we will be forced to shoot ! Come on ... sit down ! so no need to worry . Chen will be alright . Why are you in this uniform ? This case is too big for me . I can 't do anything here . And what about Chen Zhen ? - Let Fate decide it . - Fate ? Wait ! don 't you ? our Police Department has four witnesses who all claim to have seen Chen Zhen kill a man . Strange . Where did they come from ? I saw Chen Zhen with my own eyes . There is no way it wasn 't him ! It 's true ! I saw him stab the deceased with a knife ! It 's him . He killed the murdered with an axe ! How many fingers can you see ? Two . four ! Could you come a little bit closer ? No need . That 's ridiculous ! I was at Jingwu School with my fellow students . They can speak for me . as they are very close to him . What are you talking ! Your witness has just arrived . I have another witness to present ! I don 't think a Chinese witness can be heard ! My witness is Japanese ! Japanese ? please identify yourself . I am Yamada Mitsuko . The daughter of Yamada Mitsuo . Minister of Education . Chen Zhen said he was at Jingwu School at the night of the murder . Can you confirm this ? He is lying . He spent the whole night with me in my motel room . He did not leave ... - The whole night ? - Yes . What did she say ? What if he sneaked out while you were sleeping ? That is impossible ! We didn 't sleep the whole night ... We were busy doing other things . What things were you doing if not sleeping ? What else can you do in a bed ... when you don 't sleep in it ? and you ? she slept with Chen Zhen the whole night . Are you sure ? Congratulations . Let 's go . The Chinese Hero is nothing but a womanizer ! How come you are here ? I have abandoned everything for you . Now you must take care of me ! Cook for her ? Don 't even think about it ! your Master sent you to Japan to learn new technologies . To beat the Japs with knowledge . Never forget your Master 's wishes because of a woman ! What will we do now ? Jingwu School does not want to be linked to the Japanese in any way . Chen Zhen You are a student of Jingwu . You can 't have affairs with Japanese here . did I cause you any trouble here ? It 's alright . You should not worry about getting a wife . A hero should not be sentimental . You want to destroy your life for this woman ? Mitsuko has given up everything to help me . what can she do now ? Maybe that 's how Jap woman behave ? whoever it may be . It 's your choice . Either you leave the woman or you leave Jing Wu School . you obviously want to kick 5th Senior out ! are you with the Japs now ? - You want to frame me ? - Why are you talking trash then ! - Say that again ! - Then what ? Enough ! Chen Zhen Jingwu School will be finished . I don 't want any in-fighting because of this . There is only one solution ... To see who is Head Master of Jingwu School ! Once and for all . I don 't want to be the Head Master ! I don 't care what you think . Here are some students who don 't want to listen to me anymore ! I will challenge you now to see who is worthy of being the Head Master . you must become the Head Master and this woman mustn 't leave . Little Master ! Beat the Jap friend out of Jingwu School ! Little Master ! Are you alright ? Are you ok ? I lost . You are the Head Master . I don 't want to be . I will not seperate from Mitsuko . If I have to make the choice ... I will leave Jingwu School . Are you going back to Shangtung ? It 's chaotic there ! wait here . any rooms ? please enter . They have a room . A Japanese ? Impossible ! please let us stay . - Isn 't that Chen Zhen ? - Damn Japanese traitor ! Jingwu traitor ! You are harming my business . Leave ! Let 's go . GRAVE OF HUO YUEN-JlA A mouse ! On the furniture ! A mouse ? really ! It 's gone . Mice like such places very much . I don 't like this place . It scares me . They were here first . In fact we scare them ! I think you are right . I am very sorry ... To live with me in such a lousy hideout . After all it 's a nice place . Wonderful landscape . Much better than in any hotel room ! Is that what you want ? Let 's move to a place like this then ! Are you giving up Jingwu School then ? Jingwu School has given up on me . at least I can relax without this burden . This doesn 't sound like Chen Zhen . Why ? You are lying to yourself . You can 't live without Jingwu School . How can you relax ! Chen Zhen is lying . Mitsuko has found out the truth ! Really ? have some Tea . Thanks . Have you eaten yet ? I am not hungry . Ting-En still hasn 't returned ? he 's never lost a fight before . The match against Chen Zhen must have been a great burden for him . He has a bad temper . Maybe he is not willing to come back . But who can be the Head Master then ? Huo 's Michung Fist must stay in the family ! How can Master rest in peace if nobody carries on with it ? Who is teaching at the moment ? Cheung and Biu . What should we do if a challenger arrives ? My mother wrote a letter . It says that Jingwu offended the Japanese . She asks me to leave here . So what ? Will you leave ? I don 't know what to do ! Don 't worry . This is still British territory ! can they ? You Chinese love to waste everything ? Two serving for one table ! What is it ? I want to see your Head Master . He is not here . What do you want ? Master Funakoshi Fumio wants to challenge your Head Master . What are we going to do now ? better find Chen Zhen ! We don 't want a traitor ! - Mind your words ! - Isn 't he a traitor ? Stop it ! Don 't argue ! This will lead us nowhere ! Find Little Master ! Hurry up ! Uncle Gun ... Cheung . - Where did Little Master go ? - How do I know ? What 's up Uncle Gun ? Don 't pretend ! Where is my son ? We can talk about this at night . You said if I poison Master Huo you will release my son ! it isn 't that easy ! Your son is a convicted murderer in Shangtung ! You promised ! Did I promise ? The Japs said that ! My daughter-in-law told me that my son was already killed in the prison ! so what can you do about it ? Besides we paid you very well ! You didn 't hesitate when we gave you the money ? your son is surely alright ! Now stop the talking about this matter ! You told me the drug will not kill Master Huo . I would rather have let my son die . Help ! Uncle Gun has commited suicide ! Help me get him down ! Quick ! Help me ! Hurry up ! We found this under his body ! What is it ? Tien-En 's friend brought it from Nang Yeung . Hey ! Master Huo was the only one at Jingwu to eat this ! Gun could have used this food for poisoning Master Huo ... Then he felt too guilty and commited suicide . He is already dead . Please don 't make it public . it will hurt Jingwu 's reputation even more . no matter what ! Ting-En has disappeared . and this very soon ! Where have we come to ? What would Master Huo say about all this ? what shall we do ? why ask me ? Please help me out . Take this stuff for analysis . Please help me look for Ting-En . don 't worry ! are you looking for someone ? is Nong Jin-Sun here ? please follow me . this Lady wants to see you . What is it ? Ting-En is at my place ! no matter what I say . Where is he ? Can you bring me there ? - Dizzy Star House . - A brothel ? What 's your relation with Ting-En ? I know him for two years . He must have spent lots of money on you . Don 't worry . I will leave him . Ting-En isn 't as bad as you may think now . He always hoped to establish Jingwu School . He told me he wants it to be better than it was under his father . This is the truth . you have to help him ! Beat him ! Let me fight them ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Little Master ! let 's go home . What are you doing here ? Something wrong with Jingwu ? The Nijiguchi School has challengend Jingwu . What about Chen Zhen ? The Head Master must meet the challenge . Not Chen Zhen . Forget it . Let 's go . Wait ! I will go with you . You think you can make it ? even if I should lose ! One moment ! What about this lady ? You can 't leave her here all alone . This is no way to treat a woman . Get the chief . I want you to bail her out ! won 't you miss your shiny dresses ? It 's an honour that I can dress like you do ! This cloth looks old . I will find you new ones tomorrow . I 've checked . Funakoshi Fumio is the number one warrior of the Black Dragon Clan . But he is too old . Uncle Nong . Now you look decent ! So-Lan . Why didn 't you treat Mitsuko the same way ? That 's different . Mitsuko is Japanese . we only have 10 days until the duel . go on . You treat Ting-En very well . Everybody 's treated the same way . Is his Kung Fu the best at Jingwu School ? - Yes . What about Chen Zhen ? They are equal . Little Master . - Are you ok ? Go on . What 's wrong with him ? - He seems to be somewhere else . BLACK DRAGON CLAN FUNAKOSHl FUMlO Spirit Table of Akutagawa Ryuichi we have sent the ultimatum to the Jingwu School . Make sure that I chose my opponents . And not the military . Have you got that ? All the expenses of the Black Dragon Clan in China are paid by the Japanese army . That does not matter . You can leave the Black Dragon Clan if you want to . Your chairman won 't agree to this . Don 't try to opress me with the chairman . I am only a martial arts master . Not a politician . CHALLENGE Already awake ? Good Morning . Are you Master Funakoshi ? Uncle Funakoshi ? why do you live so far away ? I would have taken a carriage if i had known before ! Did father send you ? I haven 't seen your father for a long time . Then why are you here ? Because of him . Chen Zhen ? Are you two married ? No . But aren 't you living together ? Neither Chinese nor Japanese would accept if we married . Lucky you aren 't married . you won 't be a widow . What did you say ? I will send your ashes back to Japan . you are quite confident . You want to fight ? Why didn 't you tell me before ? Men don 't have to tell everything to women . come . what is the most powerful stroke ? then hit ! This is really powerful . But stones don 't hit back like humans do . What will be the most powerful stroke then ? Enough theories . Let 's do some practice . How about the best defence ? Attack ! when you can attack ? Strike the opponent in the shortest time possible ! Huo style seems similar to Karate . Based on attacking first . do you ? Hard without soft only wastes energy . Soft without hard can 't strike either . how do you teach your students ? Has your master taught you that ? Bad temper is the weak point in a match . you will lose with this attitude ! My master never talked that much . Are you going to fight ? Wait ! Wait ! I am old . I must warm up a bit first . What kind of style is this ? it 's a good one ! Are your eyes alright ? I 'm fine . I don 't want to take any advantage . It 's over ! Are you alright ? It 's not easy to be so young and so talented ! Very rare ! You have much energy for such an age ! Chinese say : The Old fear the strength of the Youth " It 's true . I have lost ! I adopted your fighting style . Chinese martial arts always emphasize on personal well-being . Not the battles . You actually surprised me . The objective of matching is to beat the opponent . young man . The best way to beat the opponent is to do it with a gun . The goal of Kung Fu is to maximize one 's energy and to develop a higher physical level . you must understand life and the universe . Never forget that . I have to go . Take care . Aren 't we fighting ? Fighting is for animals . The fight ended in a draw . I am not representing all Japanese warriors . there are many even more powerful than me . aren 't you the best in Japan ? is to speak of his wisdom . Not his expertise in killing . I have lost . I never would have expected you to have such a good student . the best at the Nijiguchi called the " Killing Machine " . take care of yourself . I have won ! Your Go skills have improved . Too bad life is not as easy as a Go game . Dr. Sun Yat Sen was a good friend of the Kokuryo . Now they have changed . Just like the military ... .. they want to conquer China . Conquer China ? They are daydreaming . It 's not a dream ! The Japanese army based in China has already more than half of China 's military strength . I learned from you already that Japan is now like a very strong ant which wants to eat a sleeping elephant . the ant seems to gain some advantage . the ant has no chance ! Don 't you agree on that ? But as I see it the elephant is still asleep . there is more than one ant looking for a chance ... The elephant will wake up . Of course . Too bad ... that most of the Japanese won 't believe you or me . For the past decades Japan received the majority of benefit from winning wars . Japan wishes to become a strong Empire . People like General Fujita are not seldom in Japan . Seeing all these factors ... .. a war seems unevitable ! You are back ! Good evening . - Where is Chen Zhen ? - He is out . Have a seat . Have some tea . Thanks . You learned to speak Chinese ? A little . You speak well . you are back ! Mr. Huo is here to see you . Where have you been ? Keeping you busy ? I found a job in the telegram station . - Did you really give up Jingwu ? - Doesn 't matter now . my current job is meaningful too . Jingwu needs you to come back . I also brought Hsiao-Hung back . From the Dizzy Star ? Haven 't you met her ? Congratulations ! You can bring Mitsuko along to Jingwu . She is Japanese . They won 't accept her ... She has done so much for you . She is a nice girl . But what would outsiders say ? Jingwu School 's reputation would be affected . I can 't be so selfish . I 've learned a new style lately . - Which one ? - Let me show you . It 's like the Huo Fist ! Yes . It 's the Huo Michung Fist . Master said this style is not for others but for Huos . This is to be kept among Jingwu forever . promise me . I have to go to the challenge tomorrow . If anything happens to me ... teach it to the others at Jingwu School for me . I decided to leave immediately . There are things in life more important than love . While I am not with you you can achieve even more . I will wait for you in Kyoto . I will take only Lun with me . I am very worried . Don 't you need more people ? Nothing to worry . The Japs will think we are scared if more people go . Right . Wait for me . please take care of Hsiao Hong . Ting-En ! let me help you ! Let 's go ! They are going together . It will be alright now . Master Fumio left for Shanghai early this morning . Stubborn old man ! he is the enemy of the military . Send the news to Tokyo ! should we cancel the challenge with the Jingwu School ? No . We don 't have to rely on the Kokuryo Clan anymore . I will handle Jingwu myself . Both of you are here . Excellent ! I have good news for you . I found the murderer of your father . Come in ! He was bribed to put the poison in your father 's food . He is a traitor . No need to hesitate . Take him out . Nobody is allowed to enter without my order . Everybody out ! SICK MAN OF ASIA I will give this sign to you . It 's my personal hand-writing . Catch ! Can you walk ? Don 't move ! General . General Fujita is dead . Don 't move or we will shoot ! Take it easy ! - You ok ? - Yes . You are only the police for the Brittish territory . I am here as a Chinese ! Chen and Huo will be brought back by us ! What ? You think you can leave here safely ? Don 't move ! you even will die before me ! Stop this ! Everybody put down your weapons ! I am sure we somehow can solve this peacefully . Fujita is already dead . It is not neccessary to sacrifice anymore lives for him . - Lieutenant ! - Yes ! Take your men out of here . Mr. Ambassador ! I am the highest official here . Do you want to disobey my order ? Attention . Fall out ! Mr. Jie ... A Japanese officer has been killed . I need the murderer for the governmental report . You must understand that . the Japanese military won 't give up on this . the military will make use of this to start a war ? I will turn myself in . Great ! You are a real hero ! Back off . Nothing to see here . Looks like Chen Zhen . Is he dead ? Why does the police treat the Japs so friendly ? It 's not their fault . They are all the same . They are working together to bully the Chinese . All they can do is bully the Chinese ! Chen Zhen was a real hero ! He beat all his enemies in the Nijiguchi Area . It was fantastic ! Too bad he had to die at such a young age . - What is it ? - Nothing . Keep on talking ! To imagine Cheung was the traitor . He was so nice . At least he was of use as Chens replacement body . were are we heading ? Which part of China would a battle with Japan take place next ? - Tungshan Province . - Let 's go there then .

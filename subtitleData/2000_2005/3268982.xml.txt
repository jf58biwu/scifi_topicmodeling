 With over a billion brain cells , we utilise less than 10 % of this capacity . The other 90 % , remains dormant . It is as if God has designated it a " No Access Zone " . In time , men gave in to their curiosities , and attempted to access this restrictive zone . 3 years after the Worldwide Weapon Ban Treaty , 100 members from a distinguished police unit , participated in an experiment to develop defence-use equipment , codenamed ' Power Glove ' . The aim was to utilise biotechnology to unleash the cerebral powers within our ' No Access Zones ' . However , the experiment was suddenly terminated , without any stated reason . ... it is illegal to possess weapons of any grade . Such offenders will be classified by the police as ' highly dangerous ' ... Good day . Today 's pollution index is in the black range . The ultraviolet index is also within the black range . Please exercise the appropriate precautionary measures . Finally , I would like to remind everyone , the sight of the moon , a rare spectacle , will take place next Friday , 7th of July . Quick . - Watch where you 're going ! - Hey , slow down ! Wait for me ! Here we come ! - Watch out , everyone ! Move over ! - Look out ! This is fun ! - Hello , Belle ? - Where are you ? It 's started . I 'm on my way , going as fast as I can . Have fun , I 'll see you in a while . Slow down , the police are straight ahead of us . Warning ! You are speeding . Reduce speed now or you will be charged . Who cares ? ! ... please reduce your speed now ... Hey ... Digital Colours , you 'll love it . More what ? Let 's go . The police are after us . I 'm not hanging around . - Hi , sister . - You 're so late . Yeah , how come ? It 's all your fault . The scooter you built for me was too slow . - That long-haired guy will lose . - What do you know ? The odds have it that he 'll win by 7 : 1 . I bet a lot on him winning . - Great , I 've won ! Money time ! - Let 's collect our cash ! Iron wants to take 9 wins in a row . Does anyone want to contest this ? It doesn 't look like anyone has the courage to do so . Will he remain the undisputed champion again ? What 's up with you ? Your hands are shaking . No , they 're itching for a fight . Look at this guy . Long-Hair ... it might be fun to fight you . Fight ? Oh , no . I promised . Let 's go . I 'm telling you , if I beat him , the prize money will pay for the Power Glove . You won 't object , right ? Okay , but not those moves or Auntie Wing will know about this and we 'll ... I 'm not into fighting with weapons . Fist-fight ? Give it all you 've got , don 't hold back . There won 't be another bout . - That 's fast ! - Really fast ! Oh , Kong , don 't ! Not the real thing ! Not bad . You sure can take a blow or two . - Yes ! We 're rich ! - Not you ! - Kong , you were amazing ! - Now we have money for goodies . Can I treat you to a drink ? Sorry , I 'm not into cold drinks . What about the temperature now ? It 's hot . Sister , stop flirting . Let 's collect our prize money . How untimely . Don 't be so annoying . How are you , Auntie Wing ? You think Mum is still mad ? Why don 't you go find out ? What 's that ? Mood boy . Its music changes with emotions . Don 't worry . Go away . Go ! Yeah , don 't worry , right ? - Go on , go ! - Go on ! What 's wrong with you three ? Taking on your own mother now ? Of course not , Auntie Wing . You taught us to combat , therefore we don 't stand a chance with you . Let 's talk instead . Well , I 'm going to say this one last time . Never ever use your Power Fist moves . We can practice the moves , yet we can 't use them ! What if I use those moves ? Who 's to know ? If someone spots it , we 're history . Dad came up with those moves . What are we so worried about ? Give me a reason , I 'll go with it . I 'm your mother and that 's reason enough . No , it 's not . You never tell me anything , not even how Dad died . Just look at Jazz and myself . We 're not related at all , yet , between us , - We don 't have any secrets . - Yeah . If you don 't treat me as a son , I don 't know how to treat you as my mother . Kong ... ! Mum , Kong 's been missing Dad . He just wants to buy the Power Glove from the underground market . Power Glove ? They 're for the Police . What do you need it for ? Are you trying to cause trouble ? Dad had one and I wanted to have one too . You can stop me from doing almost everything , but you can 't stop me from missing my father . - Kong , that 's enough . - Don 't do this . Watch your mouth . Even if you get hold of the Power Glove , then what ? Jazz , take care of him for me . - Yes . - Don 't let him get into trouble . Yes , yes . Kong , Auntie Wing has her reasons , you shouldn 't ... Hey ... he just elbowed me . Kong , Dad is a cop . My duties may keep me away from you . I may not even be there to witness your birth . I 've left you with the Power Fist moves . Practice them . Pay attention , my son . Put your heart and mind to it . These Power Fist moves may one day keep you and your mother from harm . Goodbye , Kong . Please take care . Dad ... Dad , don 't go . - Hey , Iron . - What a coincidence . Let me know when you 're going in the ring again . We don 't always have to fight . What about just hanging out , huh ? There are lots of other things to do . Don 't get into another fight ! What 's that ? Give me three of those . I only sell hope and alcohol . If you want ' earthquake ' ... Don 't stare . Don 't stare . Those are definitely the baddies . If you must stare , stare at me . That 's not a pleasant sight . What 's this ' earthquake ' thing ? My first kiss . Let 's go . No way . We 're still waiting for Sing and Kit . No , something 's bound to happen at these sorts of places . I promised Auntie Wing I 'd take care of the two of you . Hold it , my sister wants to talk to you . Hello , hello ... Can I have your hand ? My phone is dead . Did you set it on vibrate mode ? It 's really shaking . No . BF999841 1 1 2 . And I forgot to tell you how cool you looked in that ring . Thank you . Hello , Sing ? Are you coming or what ? I 'm about to leave . - Leave it for later . Just come along . - Hey , what 's up with you ? The smile , the look . Are you flirting with him ? - They 're not coming , talk to them . - Don 't come then ! What did you do that for ? I was a bit mad at them so I slammed the phone on them . I apologise . - Does it hurt ? - Why didn 't you use my phone ? A stranger 's phone is not very hygienic ... And you have high hygiene standards now ? Look , his nails are all filled with dirt . You danced well . You want a drink ? I 'll buy you one . I can buy one myself . - Well , we danced ... - And it 's over now . Good move ! Let 's drink to that . What ? You want to fight again ? Her drink 's been spiked with ' earthquake ' . Look . Go . Let 's go . Don 't fight , stop it ! I said stop ! You really want a go , huh ? Come ahead ! Move over . Stand to the sides . Move . - Round them up . - Yes , sir . Let 's go . If Auntie Wing knows about this , we 're dead . Hey , you two , hands off ! Kong , remember Auntie Wing ? Go ! Be quiet ! If we wake my mother , we 'll be in big trouble . - Is that you ? - Yes . See , we almost got caught . - Left , right , left , right ... - Isn 't it a bit late for practice ? Oh , Mum ... this girl wants to learn a few moves to protect herself against sexual harassment . Don 't move the head so much . Lift the fist up a bit . No , it 's okay . Don 't move . An improvement there . Let 's go again . Let me show you . Don 't be so tough . You need to be patient with your students . What now ? Faking death ? - Not even a single blow . - Take it easy . Goodnight . Are you okay ? Stop it . Hey , stop it . I 'm telling you ... Mum , it 's okay . Don 't worry . Kong , get up ! Get up ! I 've never been able to get that far with a girl and you ... I 'm calling the police . - Get her . - Get her ? You 've gone far enough ! - You 're horrible . - I 'm going to the police now . Miss , that 's really not necessary . Why don 't you just beat the living hell out of him and call it quits ? Just tell me where and I 'll do the punching . Go to the police then . If I hadn 't pinned you down , you 'd have smashed your head against something . And I kind of liked you before , now ... Wait . Your clothes are still intact , this must be a misunderstanding . That 's true , Kong never lies . Talking about your clothes , you 're obviously still fully clothed . Are you mistaken ? Just think about it . It 's quite obvious that she 's mistaken . How come you two are here so early ? She insisted on going back for Iron . When we got back , the cops had arrested him already . We didn 't have the bail money so we came back to see if you could help . - I don 't even know where to begin . - Then what now ? - Take me to the precinct . - Miss , didn 't we just talk about this . You still want to go to the police ? To bail your friend out . " Your friend ? " Is he your friend ? Okay , the procedures are done . You 're not hurt , are you ? Don 't thank us , she 's the one who posted bail . Don 't thank me , either . Let 's just stay as strangers . This is a coincidence . Kong and I are celebrating our birthdays this Monday . Why don 't you come to our party ? Give me his files . Practice these moves and they 'll protect you , in place of me . Goodbye . How I wish I could hold you in my own arms . Are you done ? Let 's call these combat moves 'Power Fist Moves ' . Feel this ? He 's going to be a naughty one . Thunder ! Hi , I 'm Dark . I know I 've put on a bit of weight , but don 't you recognise me at all ? - I 've met your children . - If you say a word to them I 'll kill you . Why did you teach your son the Power Fist moves ? I thought you 'd kept your children out of the scene for the past 20 years , so they can live a normal life . Your husband made the mistake of coming up with the Power Fist moves . And that 's why you killed him . You killed your best friend . Have you been having nightmares in the past 20 years ? Even if you didn 't sleep well , you appear to have eaten well though . I just didn 't want those moves to end up in the wrong hands . I had to do it 20 years ago . I 've kept this for 20 years . Give it to Kong and tell him all about his father , Thunder . This is a new era , a new government . On August 1 st , each of you will be injected with a beastly essence . And each one of you will be just like him , a warrior of the Red Dragon Army . Dark sent you ? Does he really want to know what I 'm up to ? Let me show you then . Dark , my friend . I 'm back in the Democratic Republic . That 's it ? All this time and you 've only got this much out ? What 's inside your mind ? Think carefully . I want every single Power Fist move . In the vastness of your mind , how come it 's all a void ? Who did it ? A girl . I want this girl . Get her for me . Sing , Kit , don 't just stand there staring . Can you fix the propulsion or not ? Every time I step on the throttle , it just rocks back and forth . Yeah , rocking back and forth ... You 're not supposed to race with this every night . If it wasn 't for racing , why would I buy such an expensive ride ? Total waste of my time . Oh , Kong is back . Happy birthday , Kong ! Oh , it 's you . Don 't you have somewhere to go or something to do ? I was fired . Well , since you have all the free time in the world now , you 'd better come in . Come on in . The drinks are over there . - Iron . - Happy Birthday . Thank you . Mr. Dimple here just got fired . Really ? Get us some drinks . Go on . Do you have any plans ? Why don 't you stay here and teach combat ? No way ! Our school has a very tight budget . We can 't afford to hire him . Auntie Wing won 't go for it . I 'll speak with Mum . Until you find another job , just stay here . We can 't pay you but I can make you these hot drinks . - You still remember ? - Yes . What do you have against cold drinks ? I hate anything cold . When I was young , I woke up one winter morning , in my mother 's arms . She had died from the cold ... keeping me warm . Did the heating system malfunction or something ? There was no heating system on the streets . I 'm sorry , I was ... I mean , I 'm sorry . I have to go . Wish Kong a happy birthday for me . See if your drink is warm enough . I 've always been able to do this , since I was a kid . I promise you , anything that I ever give to you will always be warm . Why don 't you stay ? Good day . In the week to come , the ozone layer will remain thin , and the ultraviolet index will also remain in the black level . All citizens be warned-although we can appreciate the moon tonight , please do not stay outdoors for any extended period of time . It 's my birthday today . I want someone to wish me a happy birthday . I want ... Erica . You know what , Erica ? I like you a lot . You know what , Erica ? I really like you . And ... You know why ? No ? Let me tell you . I rode right through your advertisement the last time , and kissed you right there and then . Do you remember ? Not bad , huh ? Since then , every time I spot you on the TV screen , my heart just pounds . I used to really like you , but now ... I hate you , a lot . You 're too into your looks , too stubborn , and too stupid . Way too stupid , and always in my face , nagging at me constantly ... and utterly lacking in manners . Hey ... You didn 't wish me a happy birthday yet . That 's right . You should be more mild and gentle with your ways . That 's because most men prefer girls with a softer touch . Wouldn 't that be nice ? I agree , at times , you 're just wonderfully lovely . Do you know when ? Like now . If only you could remain as this 3D advertisement , smiling ever so sweetly at me ... I 'd love you forever . But you do nag a lot , and you drug up on ' earthquake ' , and when I took care of you , you thought I tried to take advantage of you . There 's not a single bit of feminine gentleness inside you at all ! Wish me a happy birthday now . See ? That 's better . Its my birthday today . I heard that even the moon will be visible tonight . How I wish I could watch the moon with you , and then you could wish me a happy birthday , right there on the spot . Wouldn 't that be nice ? How come you 're here ? Well , I was going to attend your party , somehow you came here ... Wait ... Shouldn 't you be on your way to my birthday party ? Let 's go together , then . Don 't drive so fast . I don 't want to have to hold on tight . - You 're driving too fast . - Then hold on tight . Transparent promises vaporised into thin air You took my hand , but I can 't see your smile clearly Is it when the star changes its course ? You discard all that you wished for in the past Lately , I can 't seem to breathe , I even want to run away from my own shadow Baby , you 're my only one Our two worlds have changed It 's difficult to go back It 's destined that you 're my only one Saying " I love you " down the phone I really love you ... Everybody , here comes the cake . You 're holding her hand again ? Is she done hitting you yet ? She can still hit me with her other hand . I 'm in this for the long run . - Happy Birthday . - Happy Birthday . - Look at those lights . - I 'm staring . Don 't distract me . That 's it ! Can 't someone light it up again ? I want more . - That 's all . - Damn . No , that 's it . - Thank you , Mum . - Thank you , Mum . This is for the two of you . I 've been keeping this from you . Power Glove ? Your father left this for you . It 's about time you learned more about what happened to your father . This is the best birthday gift ! Let 's blow out the candles and make a wish . Go on , you guys ! Let 's . - Run ! - Quick ! Run . Kong ! Jazz ! Jazz ! Jazz ! Are you okay ? How are you ? Can you get up ? Don 't you remember me ? Mum ! Mum ! Take this and go after Belle . Kong ! Stop ! He 's dead ! Kong , Kong ! He 's dead already ! Stop it ! Kong , stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Kong ! I killed them ... I just killed these people . - I just killed ... I killed ... - It 's okay , it 'll be fine . Put her down ! Stop it , stop it , please ! Iron ! - Mum , you 'll be fine . - Auntie Wing ! - I 'll take you to the hospital , Mum . - Put me down . - Mum ! - Kong , your father 's badge number . Input it into the Power Fist data disc ... Look for Inspector Dark ... He 'll tell you everything you need to know ... Mum ! No . Mum , listen to me . I promise you , I won 't get into fights again , honest ... Mum ! Mum ! Good ... good ... Be good . Promise me ... you 'll forgive your father . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . Promise me , yes ? You heard me ? Yes . Yes . I heard you . Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Your genetic DNA is a perfect work of art . You don 't even need the Power Glove to tap into the mind 's No Access Zone . What is your name ? No ? That 's quite all right . Your past is of no significance . You 're now mine . You know what ? This is the first time I 've thought highly of a woman . Jazz , how are you ? - Why am I here ? I want to go . - You passed out . Calm down . - Where 's Auntie Wing ? - She 's dead . - What ? What happened ? How ? - I don 't know , it 's not your fault . Calm down , take it easy ! - I 'm going to look for Auntie Wing ... - Calm down , get him into the bed . - Wait till you get better , Jazz ! - Back off , the patient needs to rest . I 'll get him ! - Let the patient rest now . - Pulse 80 , brain scan reads ... - Kong . - Who are you ? Special Administrative Region Senior Inspector , Dark . You are suspected of murder . I am now placing you under arrest . The sky used to be blue , but I fear that you 'll never get to see that . Since the year 2000 , when men deciphered the entire human genome , genetic engineering prospered to new heights , previously unexplored . Men have finally charted into what was previously God 's territory , and God has finally abandoned men . The skies have begun to darken , since then . Have you ever heard of the mind 's 'No Access Zone ' ? The average person can utilise about 1 0 % of the brain 's capacity . The rest of the available capacity remains dormant . Scientists believe that if we can somehow awaken this dormant zone , we can unleash unimaginable powers . Therefore , we refer to this area as God 's ' No Access Zone ' , deliberately closed off by God when he created men . The Power Glove can access God 's No Access Zone ? Only those from the first generation batch . Three of them still remain . The Police have been using the ones from the second generation batch . These utilise biotechnology to energise the muscles and give added strength . My father 's Power Glove is from the first generation batch , then ? How did he die ? 20 years ago , the United Police Force selected 1 00 of its most distinguished to participate in the Power Glove experiment . My best friends , your father Thunder , and your mother , were all selected . The experiment was a huge success . The Power Glove was able to trigger 40 % of the dormant brain cells . I still remember how it felt to put on the Power Glove for the first time . I was no longer a mere mortal , I became God . The third Power Glove got into the hands of Combat 21 . Combat 21 and Thunder started a revolt . Combat 21 destroyed all the experiment 's research data , and managed to steal a Power Glove before he set out on his own . I had no choice but to confront my best friend . Why ? There can only be one winner . You 're an also-ran . You killed my father ! Thunder was a combat genius . He derived the Power Fist moves from ancient Chinese martial arts moves . These moves are significantly enhanced when complimented by the cerebral might unleashed from God 's No Access Zone . That 's why he needs your father . And that 's why you killed my father ? Just one of the reasons . There are many side effects to using the Power Glove . It promotes the will to kill within a person , and affects one 's ability to control one 's own thoughts . That 's why I don 't believe that your father was really behind the revolt , he simply lost control of himself . Not long after the revolt , Combat 21 went to a neighbouring country and started an underground army . He set his sights on taking down the current United Government . You 're lying . If there are side effects to using the Power Glove , how come it didn 't affect you ? I was affected as well . - I used to be slim . - I 'm not in the mood for jokes . Me neither . There 's something else , though . You may not believe it . There was another experiment run in conjunction 20 years ago . Scientists looked to genetics to tap into God 's No Access Zone , and devised a new set of DNA to be able to do so . They genetically re-engineered your father 's sperm . Your mother did not want you and your sister involved in more experiments so she took the two of you plus the Power Fist moves into hiding . Neither of you recognised your inherent powers then , and that 's why you still need the Power Glove . Also , your father is still alive . I 'm sick of waiting . Let him out . Miss , Kong is a suspect for murder in the first degree . - He is not eligible for bail . - Why don 't you arrest me as well ? Kong ! - Let 's go ! - Let them go . Issue a warrant . Attention all citizens . Please be on the lookout for a man of Chinese descent . He goes by the name Kong , age 20 . and is wanted for first degree murder . His father Thunder was a senior instructor of combat with the police . Kong trained in aggressive combat and is considered to be dangerous . If you see this man , please notify the police immediately . Your son ? The genetic experiment from 20 years ago was successful after all . Why don 't we organise a happy family reunion ? Kong . The Power Fist moves derive from 3000 years of Chinese combat techniques . Each move was computer-analysed and refined for hand to hand combat , enabling the mortal human body to unleash a destructive force . The first four moves emphasise a unison of aggression and defence . The next four moves are lethal , attack without reserve . If these moves are complimented with the Power Glove , it can destroy everything in its path . Bear this in mind . The greatest inspiration for your moves does not come from hatred , nor from anger . It comes from love . In every move you make , the aim is to protect the ones you love . This is the last of the Power Fist moves . Known as The Wrath of the Skies , its name encompasses its very essence . If you execute this move with the Power Glove , even the invincible will be defeated . Dad . I wonder , what can be so different between the two of us ? I also wonder , how does it feel to have access to God 's No Access Zone ? I don 't think you 've fully realised the potential of God 's No Access Zone . One day , you will realise that force equates power , an orgasmic joy . I 'm not as crazy as you are . Who said I 'm crazy ? Dark ? Don 't worry , I have nothing to hide from you . I am not your enemy . If it wasn 't for me , he would still be an experiment for the United Government . I did forget to tell you this . The strongest man within the police is now on my leash . May I present to you , your father , Thunder . What are you talking about ? You 're the dog here . He 's not my father . Does that hurt ? Don 't you realise that he is your father , after all ? Tell your son that you 're my dog . Stop it ! Stop hitting him ! So you recognise that he is your father , huh ? Are you interested in following in his footsteps , serving me as my dog ? Combat 21 , I will kill you . I will ! If you have the ability to do so , I 'll let you . Only the strong survive . Such is life . The strong kills the weak , such is the law of nature . He who has the power , rules . If you choose to oppose me , you will be my enemy . You can defeat me , and take over everything that is mine . When you 're on top , you can never be in the wrong , even if it means putting innocent people through scientific experiments . Who will stand up to you and say that you 're in the wrong ? That 's why we have these tragedies of life here , just as your father is one . And that 's why there are those who are as crazed as I am . At least , I treat everyone with fairness , they 're all dogs to me . The day will come when nobody will have privileges , hatred , sorrow or a diminished humanity as a result of these genetic experiments . Am I really crazy or is it this world ? It looks like you can only unleash half of the might from your No Access Zone . Would you like to know how it feels to have full access ? Be patient . Be a good dog for me . It 's rumoured the Red Dragon Army is planning a terrorist attack against the Special Administrative Region . Combat 21 knows all about you . He will try to find you , because you are his only obstacle . If you have the chance to , kill him and save your father . However , I do worry that you have not figured out how to access your No Access Zone . If they try to brainwash you , this can help . This will restore your memories after the brainwashing procedures . We haven 't tested this yet , so we can 't be sure of the results . Who is my father , who is he ? He was the one who killed your mother . - Hi , pretty . - Hi , beautiful . - What are we up to now ? - Just come with me . Welcome to this the marriage of the century , a union of DNAs . Kong ! You have to help your sister . Kong ! She 's met her Mr. Right . She will never leave me . Don 't touch her ! Kong , freeze him . Kong , help your sister ! You have to help your sister ! Kong , go save your sister ! Kong ! Kong , go help your sister ! Kong ! He killed your mother ! You saw it yourself ! Kong ! Snap out of it ! Snap out of it ! She 's waiting for you . Snap out of it ! Kong ! Get your sister ! Sister . Sister . Sister . Sister . Sister . - What does Combat 21 want ? - Revenge . This is Combat 21 ' s way to express his disgruntlement towards our government . The United Government is fully endorsed by its people , I can 't see the validity of all this . 20 years ago , the government never treated him as a human being , but as an object to be experimented with . Are you referring to the Power Glove experiment ? The Power Glove can provide access to God 's No Access Zone , but it does have its side effects . Combat 21 was most affected here . There are no known side effects to using the Power Glove . You were also a participant in the experiment . Apart from putting on a bit of weight , you seem quite fine to me . The Power Glove gave me a premonition of my own death . - Will you believe me ? - And when will it happen then ? In 1 hour 54 minutes and 20 seconds . 1 9 , 1 8 , 1 7 ... Shut up , Dark . You are not to doubt your own government . You work for this government . Remember that the 1 00 selected for the experiment are people too . Men with flesh and blood , and their own thoughts . Attention , members of the soon-to-be ex-government . The Special Administrative Region will now be my own private laboratory . I 'm starting with the city centre . 20 years ago , the government used me in their experiments . Today , I have three mice in my laboratory to experiment on . At the touch of a button , I can release poisonous gas which has been planted all over this democratic republic . Your only way out is to pledge your allegiance to me . What do you want , Combat 21 ? I 'm up for discussions . I want half of the world 's cash reserve , within half an hour . Half of the world 's cash reserve ? lmpossible . Let 's not be mean . It 's not as if it 's coming out of our own pockets . Call the banks and tell them the government wants the reserve funds . Call now . Dark , if you want to come after me , come and get me . Kong 's act still needs plenty of polishing . Kong , that look in your eyes betrayed you . Someone who 's been successfully brainwashed does not feel wrath , nor sorrow , only loyalty . Thunder , discipline your son . Iron , wake up please . It 's me , Belle . Can you hear me , Iron ? You tried to give your life to save mine . I can 't let this happen . Iron , Iron , wake up ! Belle . Iron , the only way to save you would be to access your No Access Zone - Unleashing the powers within . - Don 't , that will kill you instead . I will always live on . In your memories forever . Belle . The Red Dragon Army needs you . Do you have what it takes ? Me ... me ... me ... Pick me ... pick me ... Attention , citizens ! Please evacuate this station . Your future is doomed if you join the Red Dragon Army . Please evacuate now ! Whoever kills this cop will gain the highest honour in our government . - Let 's get him ! - Get him ! Stop it ! Stop ! Mister , are you all right ? I killed the cop ! I 'm going to join the Red Dragon Army ! Come with me . You 're quite heavy . Give this to Kong for me . Where are you off to ? Combat 21 really wants to get me , or he wouldn 't have revealed his base . But , can you handle him ? I don 't have long to go . You must find Kong . I want you to take revenge on him for me . Punch him ! I can 't . He 's my father . Who gave this to you ? Dark gave it to me , and this as well . - I am sorry , your account has expired . - Quick . - Out of credits ! - Your father 's closing in ! Payment accepted . Projection will commence shortly . Dad is a cop . My duties mean that I may not be with you as I 'd like . I may not even be there to witness your birth . I have left you with these Power Fist moves . Practice them . The Power Fist moves may protect our family , in place of me . Kong , how I wish to hold you in my own arms . Is he really your father ? He 's been brainwashed . He has no idea who I am . Dad ! Dad ! Don 't ! Wake up ! Dad , calm down ! Dad ! Look at me ! I 'm your son ! I 'm Kong , Dad ! Kong ! Dad ! Don 't ! You 've killed Mum ! I don 't want you to go on like this ! Is it done yet ? Lets call these combat moves the Power Fist moves . Feel this ? He 's a naughty one . Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! - Kong , your mother 's death ... - Don 't talk about it . I know you didn 't mean it . Don 't leave me , Dad ! Not again ! Kong ... the Power Fist moves ... derives it greatest power , not from hatred , nor wrath ... but from love . Kong ... your ... your ... loved ... ones ... No , don 't ! Dad ! Dad ! Don 't , Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! You 've put on weight since I last saw you . I almost didn 't recognise you . I don 't have the evil thoughts in my head that you do . Naturally , I ate well , slept well . You honestly think you can take me down ? I 'll try my best , whatever happens . There is a 1 5 ton chemical bomb buried right where we stand . It is to be detonated at midnight . If you can kill me , you 'll have a chance to get to the bomb . You have any idea who got you into this sorry state ? That government and those good citizens that you serve so faithfully . If you weren 't wounded , you might be able to escape . Why are you still so loyal to the end ? I 've never pledged my loyalty to anyone . I only regret that I didn 't manage to kill you 20 years ago . Everyone fears death , Dark . Quit while you 're ahead . You can be just like Thunder , relieved of human worries . Only then will you comprehend the real joy of living . Death ... is a certainty . I have no use for the Power Glove anymore . Why don 't you follow me , just like Thunder did ? Combat 21 ! I 'm glad you came early . Now I have time for my funeral arrangements . How do you feel ? The Power Glove has been depleting my life . The end is nigh . Iron , are you afraid of death ? Put this on . If it doesn 't kill you , go and help Kong . Kill Combat 21 . If you over-exert these powers , you will die . Are you afraid of death ? Iron , put it on . Tell me , are you afraid of death ? Yes . But this has to be done . Kong , it 's not much fun fighting against you . Is that all you 've got ? Come on . Come and get me . Prove to the world that I 'm not invincible ! Show me that I can 't rule the world . Come on , Kong . You disappoint me . You 're only realising 70 % of your full potential . You don 't deserve to kill me . I have long realised my full cerebral might . I am not a mere mortal . I am invincible . I am God ! Now succumb to my powers , Kong ! Iron , I can hear my sister 's voice . I will forever be with Iron . We will never be apart . Sister . Kong , this is not the time for tears . Your power will not come from wrath . Then what ? Then what ? What is the true essence behind ' The Wrath of the Skies ' ? Men sought to destroy his creations , and incurred the wrath of the skies . That 's right . Love , not wrath , is the only way to protect our dear ones , to cherish this earth ... that nurtures ... our humankind . Dark said if we over-exert the powers of God 's No Access Zone , we will die . Are you afraid of death ? Yes . But this fight must go on . Combat 21 can tap into his No Access Zone at will . We 're running out of time . You two have telepathic powers . Kong and Iron , execute ' The Wrath of the Skies 'now . The Power Glove is no match for my ability to fully channel the might of the No Access Zone . Kong . Kong . Kong . Kong . Kong , keep this in mind . The might behind Chinese combat techniques , is not driven by wrath , but love . Protect those you love . I 'll fight for my dear ones ! Love , not wrath , will cherish the ones dear to our hearts . Love will help keep this land that nurtures us . Looking at the skies , I 'm yawning as I 'm driving The DJ announces that it 's 6am At the thought of seeing you , I 'm not tired anymore Oh , all these years ... - Time has passed unnoticed - Belle ! - Still jealous of ... - Sister ! ... who 's kissing your lips today Oh , my darling The road to your home seems further and further away , Oh , heaven only knows Where do we go from now ? We 've lost our bearings . Oh , my darling Are you still waiting for that day When our hearts can be closer together When you will finally find that lost sense of security Oh , I can 't forget How we loved so passionately Regardless of the misunderstandings The residual love is still as intense Oh , my darling , Are you still waiting for that day when our hearts can be closer together ? Help me find that lost sense of security I love ... Oh , my darling , The road to your home seems further and further away Oh , heaven only knows Where do we go from here ? We 've lost our bearings Oh , my darling , Are you still waiting for that day When our hearts can be closer together ... ?

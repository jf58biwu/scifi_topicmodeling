 Uh , Mr. Taransky . She 's ... She 's walking ? Don 't tell me she 's walking . She can 't walk . Nicola ! This . This . Not this . - How was your massage ? - You 're in breach . No . No . Is this about the new pages ? Because I made all the changes you wanted , Nicola . You are virtually in every scene . It is not the size of the role , Viktor . Am I or am I not entitled to the biggest trailer on the lot ? It was the biggest on Earth . I swear , Nicola , it 's a fifty-foot Airstream . They don 't make 'em any longer . Taller , Viktor . - Taller . Taller . - What ? You 've insulted me for the last time . You 're right , it 's actually taller . I mean , it 's amazing . - Coffee ! - Wait a minute now . The tires are over-inflated . See ? It 's just this . Here . See ? See ? Look . Here . See ? - The air comes right out . - This is so sad . See , it 's lower already . Nicola , I beg you , don 't do this to me . You know , I had three other offers . I only signed onto this picture out of loyalty . Well , then show me some . They 're gonna shut me down ! It 's not working , Viktor ! I mean , my God . The scene with the thousand geese ! I don 't understand this film ! Nobody is gonna understand this film ! Look . I already put out a press release citing " creative differences . " So just let it go . You went to the press ? Do we have everything ? Because I don 't want to come back here . You know what ? You 're right , Nicola . You are right . And when you 're right , you 're right . Let me help you with these . Gosh , you ought a go . I don 't deserve you . This film doesn 't deserve you . It deserves much , much better than you . " Creative differences " ? The difference is , you 're not creative . To hell , please . Jack , are you there ? She 's good . You can hardly tell she 's reading off a teleprompter . I 'm right here . I 'm right beside you . I 've analyzed this footage . We 've got everything we need in the can already . If I could just make the proper adjustments we can finish this film without her . According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today , they 'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame . They will sue , Viktor . They 're serious . So let 's recast . Well , Nicola Anders is the only actress in the world that could play that part . - It 's a remake , Hal . - That 's right . Nicola Anders is not bigger than this picture . Of course she is , Viktor . No other name is gonna sign on now . Who needs a name ? We 'll cast an unknown . I 'm not gonna play opposite an unknown . - We can 't sell an unknown . - The numbers don 't work . If we ever wanna be in the Nicola Anders business again we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture . No ! I will not give into that blackmailing ... Viktor , let 's take a walk . - Ridiculous performance . - I told you she was bad . No , yours , in there ! Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself ? Difficult ? - I 'm being difficult ? - Yes . Elaine , do you know what these are ? - Mike and Ikes ? - They 're not just any Mike and Ikes . These are cherry Mike and Ikes . Do you know why I , Viktor Taransky two-time Academy Award nominated director ... Viktor , that was short subject . ... overseeing the most cherished movie project of my entire career I am walking around with ... Look . Pockets full of these things ! - I have a feeling you 're gonna tell me . - I 'm gonna tell you why . Because , Miss Nicola Anders supermodel with a SAG card has it written in her contract that all cherry Mike and Ikes be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into must have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened , that there be a personal Jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room and that any time she travels , her nanny must fly with her first class . - So , what 's wrong with that ? Elaine , she doesn 't have children . Don 't you see ? They 're mocking us , Elaine . We 're at their mercy . What happened ? I mean , we always had movie stars but they used to be our stars . We were the ones that would tell ' em what to do . We would tell ' em what to wear , who to date . - That 's what you want ? - When they were under contract to us we could change their names if we wanted to . Yeah . More than once . Viktor , you realize you 're nostalgic for an era you weren 't even born in ? I do remember why I got into this business . - You seem to have forgotten . - Oh , please . Come on ! New York , Cassavetes . Remember ? - Oh , here we go . - What were we doing ? We were trying to make something important ? I don 't know , shine a little light in that darkened cinema . It 's called a projector , Viktor . Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth . I thought that 's what we were doing . Viktor , I have good memories of those days too . I do . But this isn 't about that ... Or you or me or some high-minded ideal . This is business . Who do you think pays for all of this ? - This is about investment and return . - I 'm not interested ! I 'm not interested in who pays for anything ! I 'm tryin ' to make a movie ! I 'm responsible for this , Viktor . Those days in New York ... It 's over , Viktor . - You 're not renewing my contract ? - How can I ? Your last three pictures tanked . No bankable star 's gonna work with you after this . I mean , if you just compromised a little . Well , not every day you 're fired by the mother of your own child . You and I both know that I kept you on after the divorce for old time 's sake . And so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey . - I fought for you . - Yeah , well . I 'm sorry , Viktor . Dad ! Sweetheart . - Hey , Dad . - Hi . - How are ya , honey ? - Good . I 'm sorry Mom canned you . Well , I 'm gonna finish this picture . Lainey , I 'm gonna finish it because it 's important . I know you will , Dad . You 're Viktor Taransky . I 'm Viktor Taransky . 'Kay . Bye , Dad . - Hi , sweetheart . - Hey , Mom . You okay ? Let 's go . I 'm Viktor Taransky . Mr. Taransky ? Thank God . I 've been trying to see you . I 've been calling . Your assistant , she wouldn 't put me through . I told her it was a matter of life and death . I was afraid that I wasn 't gonna get to you in time . Please , just keep your distance , all right ? I did it ! I licked skin . I licked hair . I licked every part of her . I 'm gonna call security . I 'll call security if you don 't back off . I have her , Mr. Taransky . The answer to your prayers . - The answer to this . - I was misquoted . I have your new leading lady right here in my pants . Please , sir , I don 't know you . - I don 't know where you come from . - It 's me ! Mr. Taransky , don 't you recognize me ? The Future of Film Conference in San Jose . Remember that ? Hank . Hank Aleno . I was the keynote speaker there . You must remember my speech . - " Who Needs Humans ? " - Right . Right , you were booed off the stage . - That 's gotta be ... - Eight years ago . And that whole time , I never left my computer . - Well , good for you , Hank . - Well , it 's good and bad . I think that 's what caused this , the eye tumor . Microwaves from the screen . - Oh , gee , I 'm sorry to hear that . - Don 't be , ' cause it was worth it . - You have to see her . - Oh , I 've seen those people . - Not like this . - I 'll take care of that . Yeah , well , you 're talkin ' about a " synthespian " , a virtual actor . No , we call them " vactors " . See ? - I need flesh . - Flesh is weak . - It can 't be done . - It can be done . With my new computer code , it can be done . You ... and me ... We can do this together . I don 't know anything about computers . Well , see that 's why they 're so perfect , Mr. Taransky . You have something that I don 't have . What 's that ? An eye . An eye for performance . You know the truth when you see it , I know . I 've seen your movies . I love your movies . - You love my movies ? - " Straw God " that changed my life . You saw " Straw God " ? I have seen every frame of your work . You 're the only filmmaker with the artistic integrity to realize my vision . You and me , art and science . We 're the perfect marriage . Hank ... I 've had a rough day today , but I 'll tell ya what . I 'll call you about this next week . I won 't be here in a week , the tumor 's inoperable . I 'll call ya about it , okay ? No , but listen . That 's what I 'm tryin to say . The tumor is inoperable . I 'll be dead . I 'm already dead , Hank . Call me ! This week ! Please . What do you mean she won 't work with me ? She 's done nothing . She doesn 't have a single credit to her name . Better no credits than a Taransky credit . You don 't understand . I mortgaged everything to finish this film . The creditors are calling me . They 're at the door , for God 's sake . Damn it . Mr. Taransky . Mr. Taransky ! - Mr. Taransky ! - I 'm not him ! - Mr. Taransky ! - I 'm not him ! Hank Aleno ! I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno . It was his last wish that you have this . What is it ? I have no idea . He wanted you to have it . Valarie ! Valarie ! Valarie ! - Valarie , what are you running from ? - From Valarie . Valarie , no ! Jack , are you there ? Something like this can happen and what ... what is it for ? Why are we here ? Is that what you 're asking , Jack ? Why are we here ? No why . Just here . Just here . Ladies and gentlemen of the jury ... I know I may be guilty of a crime but it was committed with the purest of intentions . I wanted to send a message to the acting community who put themselves above the work . Who put themselves above me . - So , what 'd you guys think ? - So fake . Totally artificial . Like we 're really supposed to believe that was nineteenth century Lisbon . Hey , guys , who 's lookin ' at the sets when she 's on screen ? There he is ! That 's my Dad , Viktor Taransky ! She was magnificent . - Absolutely unreal . - Breathtaking . She wasn 't too cartoony or anything ? - Who ? The nun ? - Or are you talkin ' about the mother ? A star like that , who cares about the supporting cast ? She 's not of this Earth . You should be very proud . Oh , not of this Earth ? That 's really well put . And the rest of the film . What did you think ? She 's a miracle , Dad . Where did you find her ? I saw her picture on the computer . - A computer ? You really didn 't notice anything unusual about it ? Only your brilliance . To be honest , with what you had to work with , I was expecting a train wreck . You really pulled it off . - I did ? - Yeah . I have a feeling mom 's gonna take you back after this . - Back on the lot . That 's what I meant . - I know . I know . Come on , let 's go . A dazzling new ingénue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences around the world in her debut film " Sunrise , Sunset " . But who is Simone ? We know so little about her . And why the secrecy ? All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director , Viktor Tarinsky . Taransky . Simone . Simone ? - Good to see you too , Elaine . - Where is she ? - She 's not here . - Well , why isn 't she with you ? Because she would never come to something like this . She 's intensely private . Back to work everyone , she 's not here . Have you read the reviews ? They 're love letters . Listen to this one . " Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda the body of Sophia Loren , the grace of , well , Grace Kelly . And the face of Audrey Hepburn , combined with an angel . " - Almost right . - I can 't wait to meet her . - I don 't know if that 's gonna happen . - Why not ? She is somewhat of a recluse . That 's how she stays so pure . She ... isolates herself in her art . - Viktor , it 's my studio . - Elaine , it 's my actor . There are other studios , Elaine . There 's only one Simone . Okay , have it your way , Viktor . Hello , Walter . Nobody came in or went out just like you said , Mr. Taransky . - Mr. Taransky ? - Yes ? Is Ms. Simone comin ' in today ? She 's already here . She arrived before you got here . She 's gonna leave long after you 're gone . Remember , under no circumstances are you or anybody else ever to enter this set without my express permission . - Understood ? - Yes , sir . Mr. Taransky ? What if it catches on fire ? Let it burn . Good morning , Simone . Good morning , Mr. Taransky . Simone , a star is digitized ! Do you know what this means ? We have stepped into a new dimension . Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it . I am the death of real . Death of real . Death of real . Too much Meryl Streep . Little less Streep . And a little more ... Bacall . Is this better , Mr. Taransky ? Much . While we 're at it there 's a little something I wanna add to your repertoire . You 've got the wrong Holly Golightly . Remember that thing Audrey Hepburn does in " Breakfast at Tiffany 's " ? How do I look ? Gimme Audrey . How do I look ? Perfect . Perfect , Simone . Perfect . Oh , God . I 'm so relaxed around you . I 'm so myself . You did create me . I just brought someone else 's dream to life . Mr. Taransky , we both know I was nothing without you . I was computer code . I was ones and zeroes . I was nothing . Well that 's true . I don 't wanna boast , but ... Are you ever gonna tell the truth about me , Mr. Taransky ? I 'm gonna tell the truth about you . Why wouldn 't I ? Of course , with Hank 's tragic passing his secret did die with him . This is a classic case , isn 't it ? Of technology in search of an artist . Someone with integrity . Someone with vision . Someone who can see . To see beyond this irrational allegiance to flesh and blood . Someone who can see that with the rise in the price of a real actor and the fall in the price of a fake that the scales have tipped naturally , in favor of the fake . Someone who can see that if a performance is genuine doesn 't matter if the actor 's real or not . And what 's real anymore ? Most actors these days have digital work done to them . It 's a gray area . The only real truth is the work . I 'm gonna tell the truth about you , after your next picture . You 're so beautiful . You 're too beautiful . We 're gonna fix that . Is this on ? I will not be taking any questions regarding Simone . I do however , have a statement to read on her behalf . " To Whom It May Concern . I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky 's film . I will be conducting no interviews or making publicity appearances . I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself . Yours truly , Simone . " - Who is Simone dating ? - Where 'd you find her ? - Is Simone her real name ? - Didn 't I make it clear ? No questions regarding Simone . I will make my final statement . Miss Simone begins production on her new film today ... " Eternity Forever " . This is a project which has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago . Thank you . Would you answer a question regarding Hank ? Hank ? Who asked me about Hank ? Funny , why is the movie dedicated to Hank ? Are they involved ? They were at one time inseparable . Yes . And now ? Now sadly to say , only in spirit . Thank you . Your car will be ready in just a minute , Mr. Taransky . We gave you a complimentary car wash . - Oh , really ? - Yeah , they 're cleaning the engine now . Thank you . I am so happy for us . The film , the chemistry . I mean , nothing against Nicola Anders , but I think that ... God , Simone and I , we really worked great together . - Well , you were never together , Hal . - Still , the connection was undeniable . I have not read " Eternity Forever " , but it is fantastic . And I know that I would be perfect for the part of Clive . Clyde . That 's what I 'm talkin ' about . Yes , perfect . Come on , man . Look . I ran into Simone on the lot . Really ? Oh , she never mentioned it . Well , she 's very busy right now . People comin ' at her from all angles . Maybe she don 't want you to know , huh ? I strongly sensed that she thought I would be perfect for Clyde as well . - Really ? - A strong reading . Simone . It 's so great to hear from ya . How are ya , sweetheart ? You 'll never guess who I 'm with . - You met him on the lot the other day . - It was more in passing . No , you 're not even close . Hal . Hal Sinclair . What 's wrong now ? I 'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation . No , I don 't think he put on weight . Anyway , listen . Do you think he 'd be right for " Eternity Forever " ? He 's not the right type ? You wanna go in another direction ? - We 'll try and talk her into it . - Anything you could do , Viktor . - Anything . - Yeah , uh , listen , honey . What is this , some kind of jamming device ? Maybe he 's just talking to himself . Taransky 's not that good an actor . They 've taken special precautions . Some kind of new encryption . Why would they do that ? Whatever it is ... It 's dark . Dark ? Very . All right , we 'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend . - Can you ever stop doing that ? - Why ? You 'll lose yourself in that thing . You gotta get out more . How you gonna meet boys ? - Dad , I know plenty of boys . - You do ? Who ? I mean , where do you meet ' em ? You meet ' em in those chat rooms ? How do you know you 're not talkin to some middle-aged freak ? Dad , I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away . Beautiful today . Let 's go outside and eat . Young Lainey , leave the computer , please . Dad , it might be better to eat inside . Stay here . What is this ? What the hell is goin ' on ? What are ya doin ' here ? You 're trespassing . You can 't hide her forever ! Simone appears only when I want her to appear ! Sounds like a prisoner . What are you , holdin ' her hostage ? You 're the hostage . I mean , you look kinda captive to me . Lainey , don 't you ever wonder where I 'm really hiding Simone ? Just as long as I know where you are , Dad . - Bye , Dad . Love you . - Bye , honey . - Hello , Viktor . - Sorry I got her back late . I ... Oh , no problem . Hey , you wanna come in ? Hi , honey . Hi , Vic . Viktor , we simply have to discuss " Eternity Forever " . I still haven 't received Simone 's script notes . There aren 't any . If the filmmakers are happy , she 's happy . She considers herself you know , an instrument . - So she 's gonna do all this nudity ? It 's on the page . Well , we have to do something about this budget , Viktor . It 's completely unrealistic . You allowed nothing for limousine service . She drives herself . - Hair and makeup . - Does her own . In her theater training . Oh , she was in the theater ? Where ? You want her résumé ? I 'll send it to you . Okay , great . Thanks . At least , contingency for wardrobe . Anybody can go up a size . I guarantee she will not gain an ounce . She is so disciplined . Well , we 've gotta do something about this , Viktor . - " Stuntwoman " . - What about it ? - Well , there isn 't one . - She doesn 't need one . - Does all her own stunts . - Even the fall from the plane ? Even the fall from the plane . We 'll shoot it on the last day . Listen , Viktor . I wanna talk to you now , not as Elaine , studio head but as Elaine , ex-wife . Hey , second ex-wife . No , seriously . You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful . We both know you wouldn 't be making this overblown art film if you hadn 't convinced Simone to be in it . Elaine talking to you now , not as Viktor , director but as Viktor , you 're first former husband what happened to you ? Experience , Viktor . That 's what happened to me . Yeah , I 've seen this a hundred times . - Really ? - Yeah . These young stars destroying the very people who discovered ' em . I 'm worried about you , Viktor , that 's all . This woman , she controls your destiny . She doesn 't control my destiny . There 's something about her I don 't trust . Hi , Jane . Thanks for taking me back , Mr. Taransky . I know that it looked like I sided with the studio but I 've always believed in you . Honestly . Don 't worry , I understand . Are they ... - Oh , they 're all here . - Okay , thank you . I just wanna say I am delighted to have such a wonderful cast assembled here for " Eternity Forever " . A reminder , as a condition for working on this picture you will not be rehearsing with Simone . You will not be shooting with Simone . Actually , you are forbidden from contacting Simone at any time , for any reason , whatsoever . - How will you shoot our love scenes ? - Body double . - For her ? - For you . Anyway , Simone insisted on speaking with you herself before filming started . I believe she 's on the line now . - Simone , are you there ? - I certainly am , Mr. Taransky . So are we , Simone . Why don 't you leave me alone with my co-stars , Mr. Taransky so we can get to know each other better ? Absolutely . I 'll be back in a minute . Hi , who 's there ? Don 't be shy . Introduce yourselves . I 'm Mac . I turned down a Bertolucci film to be here . Hi , Simone . I 'm Corel . Hi , I 'm Claris . You used to date my cousin , Dell . I 'm Hewlitt . We can rehearse in private if you like . My name is Lotus . God , I can 't believe I 'm talking to you . We are gonna become such great friends . Hi , Simone , it 's Hal . It 's great to be working together again . Is that everyone ? Well , obviously , as you know ... I 'm Simone . Who else ? I just wanna start by apologizing for my process . I know it 's an unusual way to work but I just find I relate better to people when they 're not actually there . Oh , of course . I don 't have much to say except that I know it 's gonna be a great project if we all just trust Mr. Taransky 's vision . Always do what Mr. Taransky says . If in doubt , do it the Taransky way . I know we 're gonna make a wonderful movie together . Together . Absolutely . Veronica . What you don 't understand , Clyde , is that love ... Still too big . I like it , but it 's too big . All right , smaller teardrops this time . What you don 't understand , Clyde is that love is like a wildflower . But that flower only grows on the edge of a very high cliff . Perfect . Gonna be a little change in plans , Simone . You have no idea the effect your performance is having on people . We can 't stop now . These films , they 're speaking to the human condition . We 're changing lives . People need to believe you 're real . To reveal the truth now , it would be too cruel . You 're gonna get in a lot of trouble , Mr. Taransky . Now , why do you have to bring that up ? I mean , everything 's a risk . But it 's worth it . Isn 't it ? We 've done enough work today . Cooped up in there too long . So how about you and I goin ' out on the town ? Tonight , they 're gonna see you with their own eyes . Excuse me . I will be checking in a very special guest , a Miss Enomis . Ah . Miss Enomis . Now , Miss Enomis demands her privacy . So you will switch off all surveillance cameras . I alone , will escort Miss Enomis to her room via the rear exit . She must not be disturbed at any time , for any reason whatsoever . I 'm sure I can rely on your discretion . Understood , sir . Thank you . There she is ! Who is it ? It 's Simone . Okay , I think everybody 's here . Now ! I think we 're all right now . Oh , thank God for ya , Faith . Thank God for ya . I mean this is way above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in . I must tell you you have no idea the service you 've performed for Simone . Shielding her from these animals . Oh , no , Mr. Taransky , thank God for you . How many directors would go to so much trouble to protect an actress . It 's incredible . You know , we 're gonna have to go back to my place just to keep them off the scent . Of course . You look so ... So much like like her ? Oh , yes , of course , like her . But you 're so very beautiful in your own right . I do find myself strangely attracted to you , Mr. Taransky . Call me Viktor . - This is so exciting . - Yes . Do what you do to Simone . What 'd you say ? I said do whatever you do to Simone . What I do to Simone ? Oh , call me Simone . Yes . Say it again , please . I wanna know what it 's like to be her just for one night . You 're with me so you can be close to her ? Is that a problem ? - Excuse me just a minute , I ... - Is something wrong ? Well , actually maybe we can do this some other time or somethin ' . Are you busy tomorrow ? Gentlemen the presidential suite . Think that should take care of everything . Yes , sir . I believe it will . Leave me for a moment . Simone . There she is . - The picture . It 's a revelation . - Thank you . Oh , we all worked so hard . - It was you . It was you . - No , it was all of us . It was incredible . Thank you all . Thank you . Viktor ! Is she here ? Oh , I 'm fine , Hal . How are you ? - Where is she ? - Oh , Jesus . That 's her glass . Jack Daniels , straight up . - My kind of woman . - Come on , Viktor , where is she ? I don 't know . She 's ... - Is that her by the fountain ? You know , between you and me , she doesn 't really exist . Simone 's here ? Why didn 't anybody tell me ? I got your glass ! Simone ? Get out ! Not you two . She goes to a major Hollywood A-list party and we don 't get an interview , a comment ? We don 't even get a photograph ? Is that what you 're telling me ? Nobody got a photograph . Nobody ever gets a photograph . Yeah , we have our best people on it , Mr. Sayer . Get better people ! What about the twenty-four-hour tail on Taransky ? They 're camped out every place he goes every concierge , every maitre would , they 're all on the take . But this Simone woman is good . Obviously that is not her real name . - She uses an assumed identity . - She travels under a false name . Checks into a hotel under an alias . Never stays in the same place two nights in a row . What about the satellite photos ? What happened ? - Nothin ' . - Nothing from space ? ! What about the fingerprints ? What happened when we dusted that whole hotel suite ? Well , we have some of Taransky 's fingerprints a lot of yours and none of hers . No one is that perfect , that pure . You know , I had somethin on Mother Theresa once and then she died and just wasn 't worth it anymore . I know how to flush out this Simone woman . A tell-all story from her childhood . You have one ? I will when you 're finished writing it . Please don 't make me do this . Guard , open this door right now . Mr. Taransky gave me specific instructions to never open up this door . - Why did you do this ? ! - We have to talk to her , Viktor ! - We know she 's in there , Viktor . - Okay . What is all this about ? We 've got the tracking numbers for " Eternity Forever " . - They 're in the toilet . - She 's gotta sell the film , Viktor . What do you want her to do , go door-to-door ? Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she were alive today ! It is precisely because she doesn 't crave the limelight that people love her ! - She 's about the work and only the work ! - This is overshadowing the work . If you can 't handle her , I will . This is not a good time . She 's emotional . Today , her mother dies . Scene forty-two of " Good For Nothing " . This is not a good time . It never is , Viktor . Step aside . This is ridic ... I trusted you . - You can come out , it 's Elaine . - We just wanna have a meeting . We can talk , girl-to-girl . Just us . - Where are the sets ? - God , that is so like her . Where are the cameras ? Viktor , we 're not paying for this , are we ? What is all this , Viktor ? What is all this ? Well ... I suppose it was gonna come out sooner or later . I guess I 'm actually relieved in a way . I can just say it finally . She 's a computer addict . - What ? - She 's a computer addict ! She 's buried in here . Day in , day out . Of course . I should 've guessed . I mean it 's why she 's never goes anywhere , why she 's never seen in public . Now you 're gettin ' it . Probably spends her whole time in chat rooms . It 's the one place she can be herself . - Anonymous . - Only it 's worse . It 's far worse . She 's extremely agoraphobic . She has a morbid fear of people , of germs places , heights . Name it . Oh , this is terrible . How 's she gonna plug the film ? Viktor , she has to do publicity . Well , maybe I could get her to do something . Maybe a television talk show or something . - Taped . - Oh , make it live , please . She 'd never go there . So it would have to be remote . - We can work with that . - I can 't promise anything . - We understand . - All right . - Thank you , Viktor . - Don 't grovel . That agoraphobia , it 's like a plague . It 's outta control in Europe . It 's so good of you to protect her like this . - No . No . Don 't touch that . - Oh . Germs . She wanted you to have that ... Oh . She was there . She was right there . Oh , my gosh . She didn 't , by any chance , happen to mention me ? Actually , she did . She said that she thought you were very beautiful . - Really ? - Yeah . Would you wanna go and get somethin ' to eat or somethin ' ? Oh , Viktor , I 'd love to . Really . But don 't you have to go talk to Simone ? If I can find her . - All right . Good . Thanks , Viktor . - Thank you . I 'm gonna ... bye . Tonight , on Frank Brand Live since taking the nation by storm in her debut movie , " Sunrise , Sunset " no one has managed to land a live television interview with this fabulous shooting starlet , Simone , until now . I 'm happy to say that she 's agreed to talk with us tonight from the set of her new film . Welcome , Simone . So glad you could find time in your hectic schedule to be here . It 's my pleasure . Wonderful to be with you , Frank . Well , no one can accuse you of being over-exposed , Simone . Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight ? I guess I just think actors talk too much . I mean , does the world really wanna hear my life story just because I have a movie opening on Friday ? She is all woman . Of course the problem with shying away from publicity is that it tends to attract even more . Don 't I know it . But the only reason I 'm here now is to put the attention back where it belongs on Mr. Taransky 's film . And you don 't secretly want the attention ? I 'm not even sure I deserve it . You see , after tonight ... I 'll have just as much screen time on your show as I have in my movies . Now , how is that healthy for a performer ? Because you have to understand , Frank , none of this is real . Who I am on screen and who I really am they 're two totally different people . Change of topic , Simone . You have been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press ... Mick Jagger , Steven Hawking ... Fidel Castro , most recently , Viktor Taransky . Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere ? You know , Frank , I 'd rather not discuss my private life . But Viktor and I , we are inseparable . Oh , Viktor , you dog . I wouldn 't be here today without him . Would you like a moment , Simone ? No , I 'm okay . Okay . Then let 's talk about this work you care so much about . Sure . Where would you like to start , Frank ? - How ' bout the nudity ? - I know where that is . Nudity 's just never been an issue for me . I know that tree . - Clothes are simply an option . - I know that tree . I know where that is . What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects ? I suppose what I like most about the movies I 'm in is that they 're not about special effects . And they are better for it I might add . We appear to be having some satellite difficulties . But , before we lose you completely , Simone . - I just want to say thank you . - Thank you , Frank . Goodbye . Ladies and gentlemen , Simone . I 've been here before , on my honeymoon with my ex-wife . Yeah , look . It 's the exact same tree . And look in the distance . That 's a mountain . A hotel . I don 't understand . Could they have built that hotel since yesterday ? Get in the car . We don 't do the photos , you don 't get the cover . Simple as that . Yes . Written answers to written questions . Didn 't we have this conversation before ? Website interviews , no problem . I think people are gonna love " Eternity Forever " . " Eternity Forever " is my finest work . I loved working with the director of " Eternity Forever " . - He 's a genius . - You wish . It 's wonderful being a movie star . But there 's so many other ways I want to express myself . But it 's not enough to be a movie star . You have to be a pop star too . If you really wanna make a difference . - Nice boat , Taransky ! - Not a boat it 's a yacht . I know what you 're up to . You know , I really don 't have time for this . I think you do , 'cause I know it 's a fake . It 's bogus . You used an old library shot for the background . She never was in New Mexico . She never even left the studio . I 've done my homework . I 've studied her . Bet you have . I 've looked at every piece of publicity she 's done . And as far as I can tell there 's no evidence that she has ever left the studio . Oh , and for some reason , this woman leaves no paper trail ? Now , I 've obtained a copy of your bank account . I know you have power of attorney , but so far you have not turned over a single solitary cent to this woman . I keep it in the trust . Yeah , I know that 's what you want people to believe but , I gotta tell ya , embezzlement is a serious matter . Not to mention abduction . - Abduction ? - Yeah . Off the record , I wanna know how you 're doin ' it . Is it drugs ? Is it mind control ? Is it blackmail ? Is it all three ? Do you keep her locked in a box somewhere ? What is it exactly that you want ? I want to see her . Unless you show me Simone live and in person ... I show these photos to the authorities . You wanna see her ? All right . You 've got a deal . You wanna see her ? You 're gonna see her ! Good ! Mr. Taransky . - Ah . Hello , gentlemen . - We 're all ready , Mr. Taransky . Tomorrow night , she 'll be standing here in front of thousands of people . We could 've sold this out twenty times . Yeah , the sound check went great . The laser show is good to go . I gotta ask you though , you ordered an awful lot of smoke . Well , that 's the way she wants it . After you told us about the death threats , security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd . Very good . Excellent . Here , Simone wanted you to have these . - Unreal . - And remember no cameras , no binoculars . Ladies and gentlemen , Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present Simone , live on stage for the debut concert of the " Splendid Isolation " tour . Let 's get you into hair and makeup . You know , it 's easier to make a hundred thousand believe than just one . And now , the one , the only Simone . I love you ... L.A. It 's great to be here . Thank you . Never stop believing . I said I didn 't wanna be disturbed ! My two favorite girls in all the world . We just stopped by to congratulate Simone . Well , you know , she 's lying down . She 's exhausted . Yeah , I can imagine . Thank Simone for the tickets , okay ? That 's a good color on you . It was a great show , Dad . I can 't believe she 's doing this . Taking advantage of him this way . - It 's cruel . - Why ? Obviously this can 't last . She 's gonna dump him . Viktor won 't be able to take that , he 's too sensitive . This 'll destroy him . Elaine , do you realize that you can 't stop talking about Viktor ? I have to talk to her . I 've been meaning to talk to you . Elaine ... I 'm starting to feel like I don 't exist . Dad ? Oh , hi , baby . Thank you . So how 's your love life , Lain ? I do okay . What about you ? Well , you know me ... Married to my work . I noticed . Dad , you know I don 't like to get between you and Mom , but she 's feeling down right now . She broke up with Kent . She thinks you 're with Simone . Aw , Lainey . That 's so ridiculous . - I have no relationship with Simone . - I know . But Mom doesn 't . Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out . Dinner maybe . Dinner ? I don 't know about dinner . That 'd be difficult , I think . - Maybe a phone call ? - It 's too impersonal . They have to meet face-to-face . Well ... I 'll think of somethin ' . The escalating violence , tragic loss of human life and threat of all out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations . - Hello ? Is this Elaine ? - Who 's this ? - Oh , my God . Is that you , Simone ? - Yes . - You look beautiful today . - Thanks . - Where are you ? - I 'm right here , beside you . I borrowed Viktor 's car . I 'm really late . I would love to talk to ya but I 'm on my way to see Viktor right now . Simone , I know what 's going on between you two . Oh . No , oh , Elaine , there 's absolutely nothing . It 's strictly a working relationship . I don 't wanna see Viktor get hurt . Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him . Well , we have a daughter together . I don 't love Viktor . I could never love anyone . I 'm in love with the camera . Simone ... I recognize the coat you 're wearing ... I gave it to Viktor on his birthday . Christ ... Elaine , I just ... Oh , my God . I tell ya . Are you all right , Simone ? This does look awful , I know that . But ... Viktor , he 's just so crazy about you . Could you go to the Oscars with him ? No , no , no ! If you won 't do it for him , I ask you please , do it for me . Okay . Okay , for you . For you , I 'll go . Thank you . Well , here 's my exit . Well , I 'm glad that we talked . - Bye ! - Good Bye ! And , the winner of best actress is ... Oh , my goodness , we have a tie . The winners are Simone for " Sunrise , Sunset " . And ... Simone for " Eternity Forever " . Unfortunately , Simone cannot be with us here tonight but thanks to the miracle of modern technology she joins us live from her Goodwill tour of the third world . Simone ! Thank you . This means so much to me . I 'm just sorry I couldn 't be there with you . First , I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees . I don 't even feel I belong in the best actress category let alone with these wonderful human beings . And I also wanna thank my co-stars and the studio , of course . And as always , I dedicate this to Hank . Without whom none of this would be possible . I love you , Hank wherever you are . Thank you . Who 's Hank ? Her agent ? Her father . Why didn 't she thank you ? She did . Didn 't she ? No . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky without whom none of this would be possible . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky without whom none of this would be possible . Why didn 't I say it ? How could I forget to say it ? I wrote it . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky without whom none of this would be possible . Excuse me , Mr. Taransky . Are you ready for your casting session ? Nicola is here for the role of Simone 's sister . So much has happened since we last saw each other . - Yeah . Why don 't you sit ? - Thank you . I never got a chance to properly apologize for what happened . Oh , that 's okay . I know . I understand . When I saw what Simone did with the role ... I mean , I fired all my people . I went into rehab . I took some acting classes . I changed my whole look . She really , really inspired me . Would you like me to read ? Sure . That would be good . Who do you think you are , Carlos ... My husband 's sleeping in the next room . You think I won 't call out ? Do you think I 'll just give into you without a fight , like I did the last time ? I wish you were dead . I wish we were both dead . That was just wonderful . - Wonderful acting . - Thank you . You could play the lead . Isn 't that Simone 's part ? Of course . Of course it is . You have such a beautiful line ... Right there . It 's not a wrinkle , or anything , it 's like a dimple . When you smile it ... I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone . Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me ? Oh , yeah . That would be crazy . That would be nuts . Would you like me to try something different with this , or do it again ? No , it 's fine . Thank you . Thank you , Viktor . Happy birthday , Lainey . What do you think ? Fantastic . It 's what she drove in " Eternity Forever " . - I know . - See ? - You have to thank her for me . - Well , it 's from both of us . You won 't be able to drive it till you get your permit but you can take it around the lot . What 's the matter ? I can 't accept it . Why ? Why , honey ? I don 't want a car , Dad . What do you want ? Whatever you want , sweetie . The old Viktor Taransky . I can 't stand to see you like this clinging to Simone 's coattails . It used to be all about the work and now it 's all about her . And then she 's not even grateful enough to thank you . Oh , no , that was me . There you go again , blaming yourself . Can 't you see what she 's done to you ? She 's taking advantage , mocking you . You deserve better than Simone . - I have to go , Dad . - Okay . Oh , sure . She comes in all the time . Really ? - Is she nice ? - We 've become very close . She told me she wanted to look at my script next week . - Jane . - Gotta go . I 'm leaving early . So if anybody needs me ... I 'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone . Elaine Christian , please . Elaine ! Hi ! Hi . I was in the neighborhood . I just thought I 'd drop by . You don 't use the front door anymore ? No ! When is she coming over ? About now . Okay . I 'll just stay until she gets here . Well , she 's already here . What ? Elaine ... Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night . - I want you back , Elaine . - I want you back too , Viktor . Wait ! Viktor ! This is crazy , Viktor . Who are we kidding ? I can 't compete with Simone . What woman can , Viktor ? I 'd rather have you than Simone , believe me . Oh . That 's so sweet . But no ! I can 't let you do that . God , this is strange . I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am , Viktor . Well , it goes with the territory . But for some reason , I can 't betray Simone . I don 't know , there 's a goodness to her , Viktor . Oh , no , there 's nothing to her . You say that now , but in the morning you would go back to her . - You would , Viktor . - She 's gonna retire . - She 'll never work again . - Yeah , of course she will . - Her public will demand it . - Not if I don 't let her . You ? How can you stop her ? I 'm gonna tell you a secret now , Elaine . Simone isn 't a real person . I invented her . Every actor is an invention , Viktor . Look . You 're lucky she 's loyal enough to stay with you . Maybe she 's staying out of pity . Who knows ? I mean , she certainly doesn 't need you , Viktor . Listen . She 's thin air . - She 's pixels . - What ? Computer code molded by me from a mathematical equation I inherited from a madman . - How much have you had to drink ? - There 's no Simone . - I 'm Simone . - You 're Simone ? ! I 've done the impossible . I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being a human soul . I have taken nothing and made it something . I have breathed life into a machine . - I made a miracle . - Viktor , please stop . Please . I swear , Elaine . As God as my judge , I swear . I made Simone . I made her . - You made Simone ? - Yes . Viktor she made you . You bitch . I 'll destroy you . Had a rough night ? Let 's see if they still love ya after this . You made me . I made you first . Well , we 're back on " Good Morning . Good Day " and we are here once again with the incomparable , Simone . Now , Simone , before the break you were taking a rather controversial position . I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range . How else can the children learn to defend themselves ? If there is a hole in the ozone layer how come I can 't see it ? Immigration ? God , isn 't it crowded enough ? But God created furry animals to be worn . Have you ever tasted dolphin ? Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel . Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes . But look at the benefits . I mean , you don 't eat as much . And you 've got something to hold in your hand . We always knew Simone wasn 't like other celebrities . - She speaks her mind . - She certainly does . It 's plastic , Hank . I know that 's the way you 'd want it . She killed you , Hank . Now she 's killing me . She 's a serial killer . But I don 't know how to stop her . I mean , she 's taken on a life of her own . I can 't just come clean , make some confession , because ... I 've defrauded millions . They 'd turn on me . I just can 't put the genie back in the bottle because if she suddenly stopped working you know , just dropped out of sight , they 'd never let it rest . I tried killing her career but they liked her even more . Hank , what am I gonna do ? Not another word , Hank . You are truly a genius . Thank you , Hank . What 's the matter , Viktor ? You look so sad . Don 't ya love me anymore ? It 's over , isn 't it ? I know what you 're thinkin ' , Simone . This is a phony-baloney world . We 're all livin one big lie . So why shouldn 't you live too ? You 're more authentic than all these people who worship you . And that 's the problem . You 're lookin at the real fraud . I told myself this was all about the work . But if that were the truth it wouldn 't matter to me that you get all the attention . And it does . It does . I 'm sorry , Simone . Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed . But what I was really trying to do was convince ' em that I existed . It 's not that you aren 't human . It 's that I am . I 'm sorry , Simone . It is my sad ... And solemn duty to announce the tragic passing of Simone . How did she die ? It was a rare virus she contracted on her Goodwill tour of the third world . Did she suffer ? Mercifully , it was quick . I feel awful . It 's a great loss . You know , we 're gonna have to restructure your deal . Can I see you later ? I mean , go away for the weekend . Viktor , how could you bring that up at a time like this ? One minute , Mr. Taransky . Oh , my God . This has gotta be a mistake . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . - You don 't understand . - Viktor . - Call my attorney . - Dad . - Elaine ! Call Bernard ! - That 's why it was so light . I heard him say , " Die , bitch . " " I 'll destroy you . " It was so strange . He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie . He 's a sick man . He was a controlling madman . She was a prisoner . I blame myself . I wish I had done more to stop it . Forgive me , Mr. Taransky . I 'm just trying to understand here . Now , all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews , publicity photos snapshots from her childhood ... AII fake ? This is fake . This is fake . - All fake ? - Yes . You understand perfectly . So , I will confess to fraud but not to murder . And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions that 's also bogus ? - No . No . The fan club 's real . It 's just what they were worshiping is is a computer code . Ones and zeroes . So you couldn 't have killed Simone because there was no Simone . And this Hank Aleno that you keep talking about a renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead . Now , perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself . This whole thing is insane ! There is no Simone ! Look . Even her name is fake . It 's not Simone . It 's Sim One . See ? Simulation One ! It 's a computer code ! You really hated her , didn 't ya ? Perhaps you could explain this to me . Or is this tape doctored too ? This is footage from the marina 's closed circuit camera on the night in question ... Altered of course . Can you tell us why you 're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn 't exist ? Well , it 's not her body . It 's her body of work . Yes , sir , I know . Why don 't you just come clean ? Just tell the truth , you 're gonna feel better afterwards . Well , I 'm telling the truth , and I don 't feel so good . We all know what happened . In a fit of jealous rage , you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat that she bought for you . I can prove it to ya . Let me just take you there . I 'll take ya to the spot . I can prove it . We can just go there , can 't we ? I 'll take ya there . Come on . Okay , good . Thank you . Good work . Now you 'll see . What is this ? No , there 's drivers and discs . Where are the discs ? You have to go back down and get them , because that 's where they are . - We can 't go back down there . - There 's discs down there ! Calm yourself . You must go down there and get the drivers . Hey , you see what 's down there ? Plead guilty . Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court . It 's the best deal you 're gonna get . I could get the death penalty . Yeah . You certainly will if you go to trial . A jury , in this kind of ugly mood . You killed an icon , for God 's sake . - Listen to me ! - Viktor ! Viktor . Bernard , I didn 't kill anyone . - Viktor , come on , it 's in the paper . - There 's no one to kill . Bernard , I 'm a filmmaker . I was trying to say something . I wanted recognition . I wanted to be appreciated so I created her . Bernard , there 's no one to kill . Do you understand ? An insanity defense . Beautiful . Fantastic . - What are you doing ? - " I created her . " What am I doing ? - Get me out ! - Viktor ! - I want another lawyer ! - Sit down ! Viktor , sit . Why can 't people take responsibility for their actions anymore ? You know , I can almost forgive him for killing her . But , to deny her existence . I can never forgive that . Because obviously she existed , right ? I know it just as surely as you 're sitting there , sweetheart . She was the most vital woman I ever met . - So you did meet her ? - Lainey , what are you getting at ? I 'm the head of a major studio . Do you think I 'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met ? I mean , really meet her . Like in the flesh . I know it 's embarrassing to admit it , Mom but when I think about it honestly , I haven 't . I 've never really seen Simone up close touched her ... been in her physical presence . Have you ? We don 't wanna believe Daddy because we don 't wanna believe that we were taken in too . But , Lainey there 's no evidence that Simone isn 't real . Listen to what you 're saying , Mom . I mean , is there any evidence that she is ? Do you have any idea what you 're doing ? What 's that ? One part of Dad 's story may have been true . Simone may have contracted a virus . Certain viruses can be cured . I have no idea what you 're talkin ' about . Listen to me . There 's a psychiatrist in Ventura who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity due to the trauma of your divorce ten years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child . No more . I can 't go along with this horseshit . - Come on , Viktor . - I did it . - No . No , Viktor , come on now . - Tell ' em they can fry me . No , Viktor , please . - I did it ! - Viktor . Viktor , please . - It was premeditated ! - Lower your voice . I strangled her ! I bludgeoned her ! I set her on fire and then I killed her ! - I did it ! - Excuse me . I think you better see this . Breaking news . International media star Simone is alive and well . Her studio released this footage , just minutes ago . Simone reading today 's edition of the L.A. Times . Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary ? Details at the top of the hour . She 's indestructible . He 's coming . Oh , honey . I don 't know what you did or how you did it but thank you . - Oh , well , it was Lainey but don 't thank us too fast , Viktor . You know what we have to do now . What ? Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast ? You have to finish what you started . We can do it together . Haven 't we done enough ? - Could we go , please ? - Where we going ? Well , I was thinking how ' bout you and Simone , moving in with me and Lainey ? That 's wonderful . - Whaddya think , Lainey ? - About you and Mom ? Well , about me and Simone . What I did . Everything . I 'm sorry . Your mistake wasn 't making something fake , Dad . We 're fine with fake ... As long as you don 't lie about it . Oh , come on , Viktor . It 's not a death sentence . No . It 's life . Hey , Viktor ! Remember us ? We probably never met . I 'm Milton . How are you ? Max Sayer from the Echo . It 's life . Just call . Five minutes . All we need is five minutes ! Good evening , and welcome . Simone , the question on everybody 's mind is simply ... why ? Frank , you know as well as I do , living in this fish bowl the insatiable appetite of the media with everything that was going on in my life ... I just needed to drop out of sight for a while . I needed time , and Viktor bought me that time . - I owe him so much . - We all do . But now I understand you 're eager to get back to work and it 's not the kind of work we were all expecting . It 's true . I can reveal I am considering a career in politics . And what , may I ask , brought this on ? I suppose this little man had something to do with it . - That beautiful baby . - Yes . You see , Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son , Chip , is going to grow up in . - Aren 't you , Viktor ? - Oh , yes . Oh , yes . She likes chicken pot pie just like me .

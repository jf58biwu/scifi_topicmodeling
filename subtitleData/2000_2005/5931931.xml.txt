 I 'm word for March 23rd 2001 tonight a story of murder among friends a young man his best friend and the girl who came between them a romantic triangle that left one boy dead another accused and a town divided Khan was jealous the prosecution claims they had motive a murder weapon witnessed and a suspect he was my best friend I have absolutely no doubt the Colin whales killed Jimmy Dixon I believe it and the jury believes it to this day to the end of time but Colin Wales has his own story you on here about the monster and there are some willing to listen I just think the clones claim it deserves to be taken seriously he says that a monster killed Jimmy Dixon an entire town think that monster is colin White North when their own Emery looks into a battling crime and explores the shadowy subculture up internet-based paranormal investigators determined to prove the impossible you think people should be afraid of the dark they should be terrified fuck I the final word with decks Crawford in simply a white man with reports by Chris steller Brenda Diaz NJ Pearson and now from our studios in New York decks Crawford good evening two boys best friends met on a chilly night last December to settle a score concerning the girl they both loved that confrontation ended in a bizarre murder that has left the town in shock and two families destroyed perhaps what was even more bizarre was the defense claimed by the boy accused of the crime a defense that was dismissed out of hand by the boy 's own attorneys but not by a small band Internet entrepreneurs whose bread and butter is the stuff have nightmares here 's a marine here 's where it all began Belle Glade Florida small kanzi perhaps even idk wat term sleepy might apply here if the Norman Rockwell kinda place most of us would like to come to when the pressure of 30 million becomes just too much when the daily horrors living in the 21st century finally take their toll but what happens when that horror comes to a place like this Bihar so terrible it stuns both the mind and the heart but when we came here to answer that question we found ourselves suddenly on the other side of the camera Fredonia excuse me boys but we 're final word we 're trying to cover story here you guys aren 't interested in the true story what so ever you you guys here just for grisly primetime entertainment your Potter between commercials we 're here to get the story I learned we 've got we 've all seen the show and what a ninety day we can easily which in mind looking as run around you try to be objective but you really not know yet is it out twisted around you 'll need to sign depicted this way you put it that way and then you drop the news to hang somebody for sweeps week is that what you 're for thank arlan Colin Wales the reason we came to Belle Glade he and his family moved here 13 years ago by all accounts colin Wales was an all-american boy he grew up happy played soccer love model cars and told anyone who would listen that what he wanted most was to be an astronaut why an astronaut because that 's what is best friend Jimmy Dixon wanted to be and foremost in a thirteen years both boys lived here and played here they were inseparable they loved sports fit bone escobar that then he started changing changing how is close habits I thought it was just an and no and went through this we don 't you it 's called growing at you know that the music the rebellion to move them a but it stopped being normal Commons live with taking a dark turn been accused of vandalizing the school driving drunk and stocking his best friend 's girl Tony Lambert within four months of starting his junior year in high school Jimmy Dixon would be dead stabbed him 27 times one week before his 17th birthday and his friend Colin Wales accused of his murder three months later colin was convicted and because he was tried as an adult sentenced to death in florida 's electric chair but question still remained the weapon assumed to have been used in the murder a medallion Colin had bought for himself just two weeks prior to the killing had never been found and that was the question of Commons claim innocence his unwavering story that something inhuman killed Jimmy Dixon 3 Colin had sunken been I know what I saw Derek bon a journalist in the loosest sense of the word and he was about to take us on a journey none of us will ever forget neither will you coming up next on the final word maybe the billing is still out there several jimmy 's internal organs had been even gotcha good what more after this went might who knows the internet contains a wealth information it located friends by book all research almost anything from pets to polar ice caps but there are also web sites devoted to a safe trip suits to the strange Bazaar supernatural who runs the sites and what makes them tick once again ima read before coming to build played final words producers spent weeks poring over police reports trial transcripts and newspaper articles me intended to explore this crime and impact from every angle including Colin Wales claim that it was a monster I love that fateful night darkest shadows he took his friend 's life it was just too preposterous two people a defense to be taken seriously or was it not the there were here to get a convicted killer that world then why are you here no unicycle 18 noted 1 for what it is only through no we discovered that call in Wales had a champion someone willing to consider his claim innocent that champion was Derek Barnes a surfer in both them for the word looking more like a beach bum tonight in shining armor he 's the self-styled webmaster amid internet fight card freaky links a site devoted to the exploration and some might say exploitation a are things strange bizarre and supernatural what 's the harm in hearing him out don 't you think you could be hurting the people left in Belle Glade struggling to put their lives back together what about calling I mean his whole life has been trashed by this thing don 't you think what about his life most people would say he 's the villain in this piece maybe the milan is still out there the monster he said the flying monster perfect for your site extending me if I were shopping for an alibi I don 't think a flying monster from the sky killed my best friend would be my first choice not unless you believed in and there are other believers derek 's gathered a group of like-minded young investigators to assist him Jason Tatum is Harvard educated with a law degree Chloe Turner brings two degrees in folklore Mitt studies and Social Psychology to the pursuit and the strange an ion williams with the Masters in computer science from Berkeley keep the technical side of things up and running you know for a bunch of highly educated Ghost Hunters you all seem pretty normal it a really good do people take you seriously come what people in the people you trying to convince I don 't think we 're trying to convince anyone have anything yeah which is putting out there skunk apes desert squid if it 's where we 're on it weird yes but are they for real skunk apes prehistoric creatures radioactive kittens that glow in the dark most of the previous investigations have involves strange sightings unexplained phenomena now don 't take this the wrong way but everything seems designed for Laughs you it 's a good time but this time you 're coming to the defense a convicted killer yeah but it 's still a sighting column will sign whatever it was yeah and and we 're just trying to explain whatever it is perhaps it 's just the desperate ramblings of a young man fighting to save his life you want whatever it can to stand me in a park wasn 't anybody 's desperate ramblings you some other tape chasen and we 're almost killed bit a one of many provided to us by mister barnes and his team it began to belgrade Park the scene and Jamie Dixon 's murder it was hours after our first encounter with Derek and Jason we had left to continue our interviews while they stayed behind to document the case for their website alright so so they fight but some girls the infamous tone exact it 's after midnight and they hear the sound kinda like an airplane the prop job something like that thing comes under bushes like street towards them and they take off running may hide under the bleachers throw scared out there with whatever this thing is caps knocked out called go on okay and then because after gym and it gets him and it kills like everywhere Colin comes to there 's cops all over the place okay and and Jimmy 's million dead in the crash fifty feet over there but Jimmy hadn 't just been killed he had been butchered you have to understand that this was not a run-of-the-mill crime of passion the corner counted seventy seven distinct stab wounds on Jamie Dixon 's body and there were even indications that several have Jimmy 's internal organs had been even eaten partially devoured which organs kidneys liver and stomach holidays cannibalism Jim he was even apart okay I was good and no murder weapon and a little knife the call was supposed to have used no way impossible the forensic never conclusively stated that the ones from Jamie Dixon 's body were in fact made by a small plate and why wasn 't comin drenched in blood they didn 't find a single drop a Jimmy Texas blood on him at all and what about that with some but English teacher said he didn 't see anything which means the evidence was inconclusive exactly reasonable doubt you might think so but not have the inconsistencies in the evidence could explain away the eyewitness testimony Croke Park Park crock screaming ok honoring girl in iraq I don 't know talk might not care about you 're mine collar water near Commonwealth like said Hubbard lived across the street from the park close enough to hear almost everything that happened that night yeah my my wife 's aunts bad harm I 'm any wrapping up the phone I 'm I look back in the park acts on one boy on the ground and now and the police were point calling up underneath that the bleachers the bleachers a shadowy place where for generation kids have gone to do the things most parents wouldn 't approve a but murder Commons claim that it was a monster that killed his friend was about to gain some credibility that is if you believe in internet journalist eager to prove be impossible wanted his own through which brings us back to the tape direct bond then Jason Taylor shot that night under the bleachers it contains several minutes a video that must be seen to be believed are not believed depending on your point of view killed Pleasanton go 1 know what I don 't want that what indeed whatever it was it was gone into the night Derek and Jason were sure that they had just been attacked by the same thing that killed Jimmy Dixon or had a was a hoax something to help common case if so who was behind it surely there 's no such thing as monsters I know what I saw it wasn 't killed when the final word continues we know we 're not dealing with some John climb creature you can 't he had a bad feeling he you need to know the final word will return after these messages Spurs once again decks crockery it began as an investigation into a small town murder now final word has uncovered the effort to the group young reporters are they determined to free a convicted killer or are they riding a wave of publicity for their own unscrupulous reasons whatever the motivation it appeared that they had been the target of what they describe as a monster you seen a friend in video but what exactly does approve ima read continues with our story partisan Derek Barnes and Jason Tate unclaimed be something unbelievable that night and they even gave us the video to prove it so that 's what we set out to do wise digital that means is easy to manipulate and you get almost no loss from repeated generations all adding or subtracting elements Roger spent as one of hollywood 's most sought-after special effects experts if you 've noticed his work on screen then he 's doing something wrong what he does is create the impossible on a daily basis and if you ever catch a minute I 'm probably just quit the business and open a trap bomb in Oregon I guess at but what about this monster when his really and the gym encounter with paranormal based on we know we 're not dealing with some giant flying creature a commuter because they don 't exist but I 'm the settlement you the journey Liz and seems like some special sound effects of world war two movie did some numbering bomb blew on its way to burn it yes now that you mention it probably sample that from speedy Singhs over Tokyo 's that glenda this scone their shit as a man in a suit Roger spends Kaiser the why is that what did you see his last movie he stole the Casa before prize movie ticket right outta my wallet his faxed a the soft an imaginative young man a website devoted to promoting the unbelievable where they 've really attempting to investigate the murder case or simply hitching a ride on this particular tragedy for their own selfish gain their folger 's you have to admit they do bring up some interesting points like what like the forensics the lack of a murder weapon we know Collins knife was used but you never found it any opinion up some medical examiner 's is that the rooms and Jamie Dixon 's body could not have been caused by a knife that small these word deep deep wounds there were 77 stab wounds outright taking a pot roast in stabbing at seventy seven times and you tell me where 11 ans and another begins those wounds were so deep because nothing stop calling Wells is hand with that knife from penetrating deep into his body so you 're confident there was no monster I have to ask now there there was no monster I 'm fairly confident that but Derek farms and repealing we 're not about to back down determined to prove that what happened to them under the bleachers that night was in fact meal place on out there own expert someone who could either confirmed or denied their outrageous claim Cambridge scared features throwing so she won her about the monster common declined an interview with final word but he did grant Derek and Chloe some time to discuss his version on the events come forward she was my best friend missy is still out there you which mister yes he said he didn 't see any thank you muscle looking us he said he did he you actually are time before arguing I was mad at him because he was being an ass what Tony his current number my total that he should total she was great she think the worst the prosecutors gotta believe in that dealer now should be his girlfriend I told her to pull back a little some maybe make sure me jealous getting back on track thank you a dumb idea so I Park d June see what thank you now I just heard it I think I was turning around to look when I got hit I got I think I was knocked out matter to me screaming I just ran I ran under the bleachers time like this for it 3 turn it off field of and once again we found ourselves with more questions than answers was columns reaction real was he taking advantage of an opportunity to support his wild story if there was a monster or at least some rational explanation for what Derek and Jason experienced could that explanation also help free a convicted killer earlier you choose to serve not being interested in the truth could I say the same about you home we 're just looking for answers isn 't that the same thing well it depends on the answer it the US call in Wales what killed his friend his answer would be some sort of flying monster but but if you ask the prosecutor who put him on death row a sec and you think the truth lies somewhere in the middle I and don 't know maybe so what 's the truth about you be arm I 'm just a guy has trouble for placement and for 0 why you really doing this my are any view here because we love what we do is not a nine to buy make at this place to crash and burn without me doctor showed true them Chloe how about you why are you here game well I 'm the ability and human beings to create their own reality and believe that reality fascinates me do you sometimes believe what you encounter here sometimes it 's hard not to doesn 't your scientific objectivity go out the window at that point no except during the case of a little boy suffering a post-traumatic disorder after witnessing a brutal massacre in a fast food restaurant get by home according to doctor a new Gibson the psychologist in charge in the case doctor tennant was brought in to consult but within days she willfully transgressed ethical boundaries and put the boys mental health at serious risk she did this according to doctor gibson by allowing freaky link access to patient files and other confidential information that incident with federal but your connection to for hearings almost cost you licensed in it I 'm just giving you a chance to explain yourselves not that 's not what you doing at all trying to make it look like the Manson Family what are you doing in a dry got my DUI arrest next or jaycees bar fight Jason not demand out a grove lon we want me to do not that I picking up taking care of myself could we talk about derek 's twin brother Adam no we can 't I 'm just curious but I just said no added I 'm done we just want to see how you go about to see how we work yes then let us work alright what 's his name who became Bob and that 's done on audio how you guys a yes pretty light was on thank you manage yeah within let 's drop the tripods let 's go investigate okay you 1 hunters but this work almost around and trying to keep up OK the government had been thrown freaky links would give us fall access to their tapes and we promise to show whatever they eventually found but Dereks decision to provide our cameras full access wasn 't greeted with total acceptance they 're gonna build you up and gonna knock you down and you know what that happen before it landed on my feet before and if that happens all land on my feet again this is different get this is different this is huge Chloe not exactly what I 'm trying to say during any credibility what credibility out the window when you do it keeping up you hers is a tape from are you guys running bleachers all we doing to it I should pass for okay do it again but Derek bonds remain undaunted begin with his family few like flies lonesome is incoherent okay we wanted can 't prickly back in normal speed okay okay known fact submitted the big butt grizzly peak pop so where are we going we 're gonna look for in a get your insect repellent we find ourselves criss-crossing Bell played with the freaky links teen what we were looking for believe it or not was a giant inside now what Michael washed yet yet to suggest getting you 're looking for a back rub dogs might be a problem I maybe next yr now I mean at the bugs can be easy the property yeah and when it all seemed hopeless we heard about and be a bitch in slow news day my ass kid I was dead dead I usually find him by the dumpster up behind the Italian restaurant after ten o 'clock news okay he was talking about eight murders flying around few weeks ago for whereas a whereas at sleep abandoned building across town the building was an unofficial residence for the area 's homeless a haven for squatters and drug addict condemned by the city about lead okay yeah kidder 's pretty but it 's not common posters feel hot guy wasn 't body how would you know I are payday don 't and check this out look elected looks like a well still weird you all cared at this point in the telling a bar investigation the producers the final word and a network that broadcasts this program have required me to warn you that what you are about to see is quite graphic and quite disturbing we debated the merits of including the following : footage but decided in interest a public knowledge it had to be shown again I must warn you what you 're about to see may be quite upsetting what is it I 'm home it 's moving for out for fear not we should go don 't got no way second you cagney can 3 moment what this another victim a call in Wales or with a second body take our investigation in a direction no one was prepared to believe except perhaps Terrebonne the final word will return in a moment for a three-time winner the Armstrong Merit Award for journalistic excellence here again is Dex Crawford now there were two victims the latest found by the freaky links team in what appeared to be a giant insect nest but was really a nest or was it some creative even duplicitous attempt as supporting column / wheel story about giant flying monster was there a connection between this death and Jamie Dixon 's murder reporter ima read continues his name was and Bronson homeless and living in Belle Glade for the last three years the police sealed off the crime scene within minutes no one was willing to talk on the record not even the normally effusive they respond call in Wales was a young man facing after chair after being convicted of murdering his best friend and freaky links had come to his defense but the story that now seem to have some credence the medical examiner confirmed that the dead man had been stabbed repeatedly and partially consumed just like Jimmy Dixon but did this substantiate columns monster defense or merely open the door to another potential murder case for the prosecution do you have any suspects colin wills how do you figure well serial killers have been known to warm up to their need to kill by murdering homeless people colin is in a serial killer instinct but we have any proof that he isn 't for all I know there may be more parties up there or maybe you stop him in his tracks I can only hope so you believe he killed ed Bronson constructed an elaborate nest and then set aside from Jimmy Dixon absolutely the body bearers the same wounds same signature what if there was another killer another man another woman someone with their own pathology someone who crossed paths with commonwealth and is willing to let him go to the electric chair for their crimes no no no its people like the prosecutor make cases like this difficult from you mean because there 's skepticism the match and their ability to arrest us good well you gotta admit your theory is a bit out there yeah so we 're I 'm stein 's the reason I 'm not that I 'm comparing you have in your possession Creighton little I 'm Dec cranky a and a simple phone call was about to blow everything wide open okay alright then yes focus you cannot when you this way anything on what about our agreement we had a wonderful remember Mon Williams attempted to meet an informer away from our cameras we drove in circles for two hours Derek a toll on via cell phone that we were following her and she tried to lose is repeatedly we thought she completed until he spotted her car in a parking garage we later learned that lon williams had managed to secure a copy of the field coroner 's report from a county employee so you have sources the are your informants on some kind apparel now when I was really don 't have a payroll rain here so why do they do it I 'm human normal maybe they want to believe in something like what something

police to the attack in Belle Glade Park out cock Park crossed screaming creatures he was also the prosecution 's key witness we begun our story in search of a motivation for murder and it 's painful aftermath we soon found ourselves hunting for monsters and felt Hubbard seem to be closely connected with the one person who knew them intimately his wife really interesting % uh things get interesting isn 't so the case was blown wide open and when we come back the dramatic conclusion continues from our studios in New York decks Crawford returning to our story it this case didn 't have enough surprises suddenly the prosecution 's key witness said Hubbard was linked in not one but two murders their crimes the free killings team set up to confront covered was there a link would colin wills conviction be overturned with the prosecutor even consider defense that hinged on the paranormal ima read texts to this incredible stories final chapter be warned things are about to take a

WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS ? GIVE ME THOSE . I WANT YOU TO STAND UP AND FACE YOUR PEERS ... FOR THE REST OF THE ASSEMBLY . WELCOME . WELCOME BACK FROM SPRING BREAK , EVERYONE , FELLOW STAFF AND STUDENTS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGIATE COLLEGE , D INVITED GUESTS . YOU KNOW , THIS IS TRULY A TURNING POINT IN OUR SCHOOL 'S NEW MILLENNIUM ... AND SO IT 'S FITTING THAT RCC SHOULD LIVE UP TO ITS MOTTO , NON NOBIS SOLUM , AND SET THE TREND FOR THE BEST AND MOST ADVANCED AND MOST PERSONAL-SAFETY-CONSCIOUS SCHOOL OF THE 21st CENTURY . PERSONAL SAFETY CONSCIOUS , MY ASS . AS YOU ALL HAVE NOTICED , THERE 'S BEEN A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO THE CAMPUS WHILE YOU WERE GONE OVER THE SPRING BREAK . MR. WILLIAM NEWTON , A GRADUATE OF OUR FINE ALMA MATER AND OUR SCHOOL 'S BIGGEST BENEFACTOR , HAS GRACIOUSLY DONATED TO RCC A BRAND-NEW HIGH-TECH COMPUTER SECURITY SYSTEM , THE N2K . THIS IS THE SAME SECURITY SYSTEM THAT WILL BE INSTALLED TO PROVIDE SECURITY ON A NUMBER OF MILITARY BASES AROUND THE WORLD , AFTER WE HAVE COMPLETED THE BETA TESTING HERE , OF COURSE . SO WE SHOULD BE AWARE THE SCHOOL IS NOW EQUIPPED WITH AN ARRAY OF SENSORS AND CAMERAS THAT ALLOW THE COMPUTER AND ME TO COORDINATE AND MONITOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS HERE AT RCC . REST ASSURED , THIS IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM , AND FOR THE MOST PART SHOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES . THERE IS , HOWEVER , ONE KEY ELEMENT THAT WILL AFFECT ALL OF YOU . IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ENTER ANY BUILDING OR PASS THROUGH ANY DOOR WITHOUT FIRST IDENTIFYING YOURSELF . YOUR STUDENT CARD WILL NOW BE USED WITH THE CARD-READERS ALL OVER THE CAMPUS , UNLOCKING ONLY THOSE AREAS TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN GRANTED ACCESS . [ JO ] : THIS IS MY PUNISHMENT ? HE HAS GROUNDED ME AT SCHOOL . WELL , MAYBE THIS WILL HELP . IT 'S FOR YOU . AN UNLIMITED SPENDING LIMIT ? YEAH , DON 'T YOU WISH , GIRL ? IT 'S A BYPASS CARD . IT 'LL UNLOCK ANY DOOR ON THE SYSTEM . I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU KEEPING A DISTANCE FROM THESE FENCES . ANYTHING THAT TOUCHES THEM WILL BE INSTANTLY HIT WITH AN ELECTRIC SHOCK THAT WOULD TAKE DOWN A 300-POUND GORILLA . I 'M NOT MAKING THIS UP . THIS IS STRICTLY FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES ONLY . I JUST HATE TO SEE YOU LOCKED IN AND TRAPPED ANYWHERE . WHAT ABOUT THE SECURITY RISK OF ME ESCAPING FROM THIS PRISON ? NOT THAT THERE 'S ANYWHERE TO ESCAPE TO , EXCEPT MAYBE SOME DREADED GENETICALLY MUTATED HILLBILLY AND HIS THREE-HEADED FISH CHILDREN . HA HA HA . VERY FUNNY . THIS IS NO PRISON . THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY . I 'D HAVE GIVEN MY RIGHT ARM TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE ? YEAH ? ALL YOU NEED IS A BILLIONAIRE FATHER THAT DOESN 'T WANT YOU AROUND . REMEMBER ALL WE TALKED ABOUT ? CHANNEL ALL THAT BAD RIGHT INTO GOOD , REMEMBER ? YOU REALLY CARE , DON 'T YOU . NAH . IT 'S JUST FOR SHOW . SEE ? NOW , I KNOW THIS IS ALL NEW , SO I 'LL BE AVAILABLE TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU ... YEAH , FOR PERSONAL MOLESTATION . ... TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE . NOW , THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON I CALLED YOU HERE TODAY , THE ORIGINAL SCHEDULE FOR THIS WEEK HAD A FIELD TRIP STARTING AT THE END , HOWEVER ... [ SAWING ] HEY ! SO WE 'VE DECIDED TO REVERSE THINGS A LITTLE . THERE ARE SOME UNFINISHED THINGS IN THE N2K COMPUTER SYSTEM , SO WE DECIDED TO REVERSE THINGS A LITTLE . THE BUSES FOR RUSSELL AND WILSON HOUSES WILL LEAVE FOR THE GEOGRAPHY TRIP IMMEDIATELY , AND THE REST , IN ONE HOUR . COME ON , HOLD IT , HOLD IT , HOLD IT . I 'M SURE YOUR PALM PDQs WILL SURVIVE THIS MINOR RESCHEDULING . I 'M ALSO INSISTING THAT FIVE PREFECTS FROM EACH HOUSE STAY BEHIND TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS READY WHEN YOU GET BACK , AND THAT IS ALL . GOOD DAY , EVERYBODY . GOOD DAY . HE CAN 'T BE SERIOUS . UNBELIEVABLE . I GUESS I 'M MISSING BRADEEN 'S ORIENTATION SPEECH . WHAT A SHAME . HEY , I CAN SEE YOUR PREFECT TRIBE NOW . I THINK I 'LL GO SAY HELLO . WHAT 'S YOUR DEAL WITH THEM ? OH , THEY SEEM LIKE DECENT KIDS , JOANNE . MAYBE THEY 'D BE GOOD FRIENDS FOR YOU . MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT WORKING ON BEING A GOOD FRIEND FOR THEM . OH , GEE , THANKS , DAD . JUST A THOUGHT . IT 'S YOUR LIFE . DO WITH IT AS YOU WISH . ALL RIGHT . YOU KNOW THE DRILL . YOU CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING . HAVE A GOOD SEMESTER , JOANNE . AH ... I DO THINK IT 'S A LITTLE LAME THAT YOUR BODYGUARD IS YOUR BEST FRIEND . YOU TAKE CARE . THANKS FOR THE COCKTAIL , MR. BRADEEN . MY PLEASURE . ARE SO INTERESTED IN RCC 'S NEW SECURITY SYSTEM . YES , VERY MUCH SO . IT 'S THE FUTURE OF SCHOOLS EVERYWHERE . WELL , HERE YOU ARE , MR. BRADEEN . IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO YOU FOR ? NO , THAT 'S GREAT , BOB . THANK YOU VERY MUCH . IF YOU NEED TO GET ANYWHERE IN THIS SCHOOL , YOU JUST LET ME KNOW , OKAY , MR. WALSH , 'CAUSE I GOT THE KEYS FOR EVERYTHING , ALL RIGHT , AND IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ANY SPECIAL PHOTOS ... THAT 'S EVERYTHING , BOB . THANK YOU . OKAY . THAT 'LL BE IT . DO YOU MIND ? I 'M ENTERING THE CODE . IT SEEMS VERY ... SIMPLE . YES , ACTUALLY . THE N2K 'S AN EXTREMELY EFFICIENT MACHINE . FOR EXAMPLE , WHILE THE STUDENT BODY IS AWAY , E COMPUTER WILL SHUT DOWN ALL NON-ESSENTIAL SYSTEMS . NOW , THE PREFECTS ARE HERE . THE COMPUTER WILL BECOME AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE , AND TAKE CARE OF ALL THEIR NEEDS . AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE ? THAT IS THE GENIUS OF THE N2K , MR. WALSH . IT GROWS BY THE INPUT DEVICES CONNECTED TO IT . ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE . MR. NEWTON PREFERS WE USE THE TERM " HIGH MODULAR INTERFACE . " APPARENTLY , HE USED HIS OWN BRAINWAVE PATTERNS AS PART OF N2K 'S PROGRAMMING . I SEE . IT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIG-BROTHERISH . WE ALL NEED A BIG BROTHER 'S PROTECTION NOW AND THEN , DON 'T WE , MR. WALSH ? SHALL I GET THAT PICTURE NOW ? CERTAINLY . WELL ? COME ON , C , IS SHE NAKED OR WHAT ? HOLD ON . AW , WHAT THE HECK ? HEY , YOU GUYS GET THE SHOT YOU WANTED ? JO !

GOODBYE , YOU BASTARD BLIND DOG FROM HELL . NON NOBIS SOLUM . NON NOBIS SOLUM . THANK YOU . " NOT FOR OURSELVES ALONE " . THOSE LATIN WORDS ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THIS SCHOOL . IT 'S THE FIRST THING YOU SEE WHEN YOU ENTER THE BUILDING . IT 'S THE FIRST THING YOU SEE WHEN YOU VIEW OUR WEBSITE ... OR AT LEAST IT USED TO BE . OH , BABY , BABY . YOU KNOW SOMETHING ? I USED TO BE QUITE A PRACTICAL JOKER I THINK OF MYSELF AS HAVING A REALLY FINE SENSE OF HUMOR , BUT THIS ... THIS IS TOO MUCH . WAY TOO MUCH . THIS DEGRADES THE STUDENTS , THIS DEGRADES THE SCHOOL , AND THIS DEGRADES ME , AND THAT 'S THE REASON THAT YOU GUYS , YOU FIVE CLOWNS , ARE NOT GOING ON YOUR GEOGRAPHIC TRIP . YOU HAVE GOT TILL THE END OF THE WEEKEND TO TELL ME WHO 'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS OR THERE WILL BE NO GRADUATION FESTIVITIES OF ANY KIND- - THAT 'S INCLUDING YOUR , UH , PROM NIGHT . MR.

Tell me the name of the town . Tell me where lam . - San Gradura . - Mexico ? Man , if you can 't remember , you must 've had one fine good time getting here . What 's your name ? Damn . You don 't know that either , huh ? I 'll call you One Shoe . Señor Un Zapato , uh ? One Shoe , what do you know ? I know I 'm getting the hell out of here . You got money to buy the police ? Cos that 's what it takes . I need to get to a phone and call the US Embassy . Yeah . They can get you home , I guess . Where is home ? You know what I think , One Shoe ? Maybe getting home is not in your best interests . - How 's that ? - This isn 't Tijuana or Cabo . We don 't see Americans in this town unless they 're running from something , somebody . People like me ? You don 't know me . Hey , you don 't know you . Daddy ? Daddy ? Domingo Salmeron ? Nestor ! Me estoy volviendo viejo aqui encerrado . Esas cosas toman tiempo . Caballeros , ha sido un placer . Cuanto por él ? Es caro ? No mucho . Por qué ? Estas enamorado ? Hey , One Shoe . Nobody coming for you . You wanna hop out of here with me ? - I got a job for you . - Domingo , es está . - What kind of job ? - What the hell do you care ? You work hard , maybe I 'll even buy you another shoe . Right one , left one - your choice . Hey . Right here . Thanks . Some other time . Hey . Hey ! You watch your hands . You 're bought and paid for . You understand ? I own you like I own that car . I 'll pay you back . You don 't tell me what you 'll do . I tell you what you 'll do . This makes one thing we know about you . You 're not a man of your word . Céllate . Estoy tratando de concentrarme . It fit good ? Mi zapato ? What else of mine you got ? My wallet , my documents ? Mis documentos ? No , no documentos . What else did you take from me ? Show me what else you got . Show me . Show me ! Qué es mio ? Rapido ! Ya estuvo . No mas . Desaparecido . Desaparecido ? I 'm desaparecido ? What does that mean ? No comprendo . What 's the job ? We 're movers . What do you move ? Mexicanos , Guatemaltecos , sometimes even Chinese . Drive them up north , cross the border into McAllen . - You 're coyotes . - Don 't turn your nose up at me . For all you know , you 've spent your life fondling little boys . No digas que quieres trabajar con este hijo de perra . You start tomorrow . I 'd invite you to have a drink with us , but Nestor hates you . They 'll rent you a room upstairs . I don 't have any money . First month 's salary . Don 't try and leave town . This mean anything to you ? Not a thing . Other than that you have silver in your pocket and you still ask me for money . I 'm a marine . Semper fi . AD Skinner , Agent Scully , what 's this I 'm hearing about Mexico ? This came in last night from US Customs . It 's from a security camera at the border crossing in Laredo , Texas . It was taken at 12.50 a.m. on the morning of the fourth . Sure it 's Doggett ? It 's been scanned to Reyes . She also believes it is him . I 'd say this reshapes the investigation . It 's our first solid lead . With your permission , I 'd like to extend our task force south of the border . I 'm not extending the task force . I 'm disbanding it . - Excuse me ? - I see no other choice . The past 12 days , I 've had 40 agents working overtime , scouring the entire state of Texas - in what appears to be a waste of effort . I can 't move them look , stock and barrel into Mexico . Not on the strength of this . Turn it over to the Mexican federal police . - Doggett 's in their jurisdiction , not ours . - He could be injured . Whether you believe it or not , I want to find him as badly as you do . But the FBI 's resources are already taxed by national security concerns . There are political realities I have to account for . Sir , Agent Reyes is still in San Antonio . She was raised in Mexico . She could offer the federal police some on-site help . She can help them all she wants . But from this side of the border . Mr Molina , you 're a hard man to get an audience with . I 've been trying for the better part of two weeks . What 's keeping you so busy ? Selling tractors . I own the biggest farm-equipment dealership in South Texas . AGCO , John Deere , New Holland , Cat . Impressive . - I 'm sorry , I don 't speak Spanish . - She says I sell drugs . Please don 't speak Spanish any more . You know Hollis Rice , don 't you ? Vice President of Pan-American Mercantile . Sure . I do business with his bank . I know he 's missing . My partner , John Doggett , was investigating his disappearance . I 'm betting he came to you with questions . - When would this have happened ? - Two weeks ago . No . Sorry . I don 't remember any person named Doggett . Agent , what are you implying ? Mr Molina 's a businessman and a pillar of the c ... Pillar of the community ? Does anyone actually say that except mob lawyers ? I 'll tell you what 's clear to me . You 're some kind of middleman in a smuggling operation . Hollis Rice laundered money for your cartel until he got greedy or talked too much . - Your cartel made him disappear . - Agent ... My partner 's disappeared too . He 's in Mexico , and I will find him , whatever it takes . Your only personal hope for the future is that I find him alive . Now , where is he ? Unless my client is under arrest , this meeting is over . No ? Come on , Mariano . Daddy ? Daddy ? Get up . I wanna show you something . Come on . Let 's go . Daddy , come on . Please ! - Can 't it wait another hour ? - No , - Why ? What is it ? - It 's a surprise . Don 't wake your mom . Señor ? Señor ? Señor ? Cabina tres . Marine Corps Public Affairs Office . Staff Sergeant McCormick . Yeah ... This is Detective ... Ladatel , calling from Mexico . I 'm hoping you can give me some help . Yes , sir , if I can . We 've got a marine down here who 's been hit by a taxi . He 's been messed up pretty good . He doesn 't remember his own name . He doesn 't have any ID . We need to contact his family . I assume somebody somewhere is worrying about him . Can you give me a social security number or date of birth ? No . The only thing I have to go by is there 's a tattoo on his left shoulder that says : " 24th MAU . We shall not forget . " You have any idea what that means ? Yes , sir , I do . The 24th Marine Amphibious Unit . It refers to the Lebanon barracks bombing in 1983 . That narrows things down . Yeah . Good , good . This guy 's , I don 't know , he 's six feet , 190Ibs , brown hair , blue eyes , about 40 years old . If you could just put a name to him . If you could just tell me anything at all about him . Anything . We 'll definitely look into it . Detective , do you have a number where I can reach you ? Detective ? Hey . Sounding good . It 's sounding better than it was . It won 't sound good until it gets new seals . Ah , tu ves ? Mas de lo que tu hayas hecho , sentado ahi . Thank God I got somebody worth a damn . Now if you 'd only drive for me ... If you got a few odd jobs , fine . I 'm not breaking the law for you . Man of principle - as far as you know . Found something out about you today . You 're not gonna like it . Says your name is Henry Bruck . Federales are looking for you in connection with a double murder . Doesn 't give details , but that description 's you , as far as I can see . Don 't take it so hard . A man does what he does . I 'm not judging you . Just keep away from the federales , OK ? We 'll keep you safe . Monica . - Dana ! - Surprise , surprise . How did you escape Kersh 's cost-cutting regimen ? Did you see ? He shut us down . Actually , he doesn 't know that I 'm here . Or that Skinner is headed to Mexico to consult with the federal police . Perfect timing , I hope . Look what just got handed to me . It says someone in Mexico is trying to find an ex-marine matching Doggett 's description . It says that he was in an accident and possibly suffering from amnesia . - Wait . Detective Ladatel ? - That 's who placed the call . Sound familiar ? Ladatel is a Mexican telephone calling card . We 'll trace the call . Domingo , is that you ? Siempre trabajo . I speak English , by the way . Yeah ? Yeah . See you in hell , FBI . Nestor ? Nestor ! - You ? - Did you send him after me ? What ? What 's that mean ? Did you send him to kill me ? - Tell me who lam . - I don 't know who you are . Tell me who I am ! I don 't know , you son of a bitch ! But you killed my friend . You 're a killer , that 's who you are ! Desaparecido . You 're one of the disappeared ones . What 's that mean , disappeared ? Disappeared by who ? The cartel . They own the town , everything and everybody . People who make trouble for them wind up dead . Other people , who make more trouble dead than alive , get this . They took away my memory ? How ? How do I get it back ? You don 't ! That 's the point . Daddy ? Daddy ? Get up . I wanna show you something . It 's a surprise . No . John . I 've been looking for you everywhere . - Who are you ? - I 'm your partner , Monica . Your name is John Doggett . You 're an FBI agent . Do you remember ? John , trust me . We gotta leave . I 'll explain it in the car , but we 're not safe here . Todos Ios ocupantes del edificio salgan inmediatamente con las manos en alto . - They 're telling us to come out . - They want us to make it easy for ' em . The cartel owns the cops . They 're gonna kill us . They 're gonna try . Take cover . Won 't be long before they get tired of waiting . So we 're partners , huh ? How long have we been working together ? Not long . But we 've known each other for years . Tienen un minuto para salir . They 're giving us one minute . What 's the name of my son ? It 's weird . It 's the only thing I can remember , is I have a son . I can see his face , but I can 't remember his name . Luke . Luke . How old is Luke ? I can 't even remember that . Oh , God . Oh , God , no . He 's dead . He was murdered . Is that right ? Is that right ? He was kidnapped . He was just a little boy ... Oh ... The FBI got involved . I was assigned to the case . That 's when you and I met . Oh , God , John , they 're smoking us out . John , I need you here . I need you to focus here , John . John . John ! If we 're gonna die here , you 're gonna die on your feet ! You hear me ? Do you hear me ? Get in the bus . Hang on ! Argh ! You work for the cartel . You make their enemies disappear . Desaparecido . You understand me ? I speak English , but I don 't understand you . Like hell you don 't . You gave me these ... when you took my memory . I have no idea how you do it , but everything I am , everything I have , my identity , you robbed that from me . I don 't know who has been saying those things to you . How can you prove them ? I was searching for a man . A banker from Texas . Hollis Rice was the banker . He was out of his mind . He didn 't even know his name . You robbed him of that . Then you tried to do the same thing to me . You failed , you son of a bitch . I remember everything . Agent Doggett ... leave him to us . Why would you want to remember ? You can 't tell me you 're happier now because you recall your life . I saw it all . So much pain . Why would you want to struggle so long and hard ... to get that pain back ? Because it 's mine . Daddy ? Daddy ? Look , Daddy . I can do it . John . I 'm so sorry . About Luke . About you having to relive that . I 'll take the bad as long as I can remember the good . I made this !

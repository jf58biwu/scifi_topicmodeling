Driving gloves , driving goggles , driving thong . There ! Maybe I should drive . You ? A woman ? I 'm trying to catch a monster , not find the quickest route to the mall . Let me just adjust the seat . My God , he 's gonna do it ! Everyone , seat belts to maximum buckling ! Pazoozoo ? Pazoozoo ? Hey , Grandpa ! Move your wrinkly old keister ! Shut up ! For heaven 's gate ! This ship can do 99 percent light speed . Why are we going 35 miles an hour ? Because we 're in a hurry , that 's why ! Plus , you have the high beams on ! I can 't quite read the sign . Pazoozoo ? Pazoozoo ! Oh , it 's 2 : 30 . We can still catch the early-Bird dinner special . Aren 't we looking for your gargoyle ? My what ? Hello , Mavis . Surprised to see me back again so soon ? Mavis is dead . I expect you 'll want to see my angry , crotchety , grandpa discount card ? Sir , this card has expired . But it 's good for a lifetime . Well , yours expired . Oh , Lord ! Teeth do not belong in your pants , professor . Well , I can 't keep them in my mouth , they 're nuclear-Powered ! Ow ! It bit my finger . No ! No ! It 's tasted human blood ! Mm . Damn good meat . Professor , we 've talked it over , and everybody thinks you 're too old . We 've decided to do the merciful thing , and have you youth-A-Sized . Dear God , no ! Relax , professor . Youth-A-Sizing is a trendy new spa treatment . It 's this season 's shark-Cartilage enema ! But I like being old !

Let 's get started with a nice botulism treatment , shall we ? Go to hell , Heather ! Oh . In small doses , botulism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles ... Instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable . Give me back my floppy face ! Careful with the giblets ! You 're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints . More pressure . Ahhh . Since this is such a serious case of old , we 'll try our strongest treatment : A soothing , full-Body bath in searing hot tar . Sir , it 's not necessary or wise to be naked . You sound just like my tennis instructor . The tar blisters the age right out of the body ... In what top scientists suspect is a miracle . I don 't have time for this ! I have to go buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it ... Making people wait behind me while I complain . He still sounds sort of old , sort of real old . Step aside , lady . Like everything else in life ... Pumping is just a primitive , degenerate form of bending . Whoa . Whoa-Oa . Whoa ! Come on , Bender ! Pump harder ! Harder ! I 'm trying as hard as I can . Harder , damn you ! Well , that was an utter waste of time . Professor , it worked ! You look young enough to be my father ! Poodle spit ! Fifty-Three years old ? Oh , now I 'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-Porn . Cool , professor . We should go out and celebrate ! Dear Lord ! You 've all reverted to your childhood forms ! Hooray ! I 'm a teenage heartthrob again . While I try to restore our normal ages ... I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals . It wasn 't me , Mr. F. It was Amy . Stop it , Amy ! You stink ! You know you did it ! Quiet ! Quiet , I say ! We 're here to take my little stub of a husband home . Hermes , say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth . Goodbye , Mr. Dumbsworth ! Hey ! This is my chance to spend time with my parents too . But your parents are gross sewer mutants . Ow ! When I was an orphan ... I wished I could grow up with my mom and dad . And now , thanks to being hurled backwards in time- - That 's not what happened ! Shut up and go live with your parents ! It 's gonna be totally awesome , Mom ! You and me can bake , and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face ... And if some kid picks on me , my dad can beat up his dad ! Can 't I just beat up the kid ? Well , okay , Leela . If you think you can put up with your father , then welcome home . We 'll try to respect your independence and freedom . No ! I want the real teen experience . Chores , curfew , the works ! Fine , sweetiekins , we 'll be the strictest parents ever . Now , let 's all have some tequila to celebrate ! Dad , I 'm underage ! Oh , right . Here 's a silly straw .

She fat ! Dad , if you 're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again ... I 'm just gonna stay in my room ! Stay in room ? You so fat , you gonna stay all around room . I 've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth . Suddenly , I 'm going to the bathroom like clockwork , every three hours . And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks . Now I have to pay them ! I 'm tired of you yapping ! All you ever do is complain . You never try to make things better . Well , I 'm running away from this dead-End family . I know there 's a place for people like me , with new ideas . There has to be ! Fine . Get going .

I can 't reach the hand brake ! That 's detention . And then a giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps ... But we totally dissed Moose . Yes , I 'd like to meet this Moose . But in the meantime , I have good news ! I may have solved our age problem . Yay ! It seems the youth-A-Sizing tar was saturated with time-Altering kronatons . A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA ... As well as Bender 's robo , or " RNA . " Question . Yes ? You stink . Yes , yes . Anyhow , I 've designed an oil-Eating bacterium ... That should take the tar right off . Come on . Let 's go tell Leela so we can grow up together . Thanks , professor , but I don 't want the treatment . Don 't you understand , you little nitwit ? Unless you 're treated soon , the only way to restore your true age ... Will be to grow into it , just as God intended . He has a point , honey . What about your job and your friends ?

Spreading kronatons throughout our systems ! We 're getting younger by the minute ! What ? I 'm gonna revert through all my larval stages ? Word . We 'll all keep getting younger and younger ... Until we suffer a fate worse than death : Pre-Life ! Then death . I 've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up ... And suffer the agony of un-Birth ! Think , you disco duck , think !

" Snow White Dwarf and the Seven Red Dwarfs . " " Charlotte 's Tholian Web . " " The Fountain of Aging . " The Fountain of Aging ? Hm . It is just a legend .

I had a few beers , but I 'm cool to drive . I wish I could come with you to say goodbye ... Before you all turn back into grownups ... But I 'm grounded for knocking the school over . Who cares , Leela ? It was just a public school . Now , go with your friends , please . No ! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room ! Until she sneaks out . When I grow up , I wanna be a steam shovel ! According to this , the fountain is located in the darkest ... Most ancient region of space , just past Teddy Bear Junction . Teddy Bear Junction , the worst scum-Hole in the galaxy . This solar system is , like , way old ! Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet ! News flash : Everything 's getting older the closer we get to that ancient , burnt-Out sun . Dude , the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself ! Shut up ! I was gonna say that . We 've got to hurry . The kids have only one change of pants . We gotta be real , real careful to stay in just long enough ... To make us our right ages again . Zoidberg , get out of there ! The current ! It 's too much already ! Help ! Jeepers ! Zoidberg is dead ! Zoidberg 's brother is dead . Funny story . I just reverted to the age when my siblings budded from me ...

Are you back to your original age , professor ? Even older ! Huzzah ! I 'm sorry you had to give up being a kid , Leela . Well , I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes . But I worked hard to be the person I am . The fabulous person . With friends like you guys . Fabulous friends . And I 'm really happy I have that life back . And you , my faithful fiend , how can I ever repay you ? And that , little one , is how Papa gained his freedom . Now , bonne nuit . Bonne nuit to you all .

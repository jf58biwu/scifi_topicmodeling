 How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back Finally , the last form of the day . Welcome to stampy town , population five . And now for the finishing touch . The cycle of bureaucracy . Sweet gorilla of Manila ! A letter from Central Bureaucracy ! Attention : You are about to receive a letter from Central Bureaucracy . It 's from Central Bureaucracy ! I 'm playing poker with friends from my old job . Interested ? I only gamble with chumps . - I 'll play . - I 'm in ! Leela . Fry . Robot . No matter what , I 'm available . We 're playing poker . But my friends are serious . Bah ! Big shots . I say let the dice do the talking . - Is someone fired ? - Better . Central Bureaucracy is inspecting tomorrow . I 'll finally be promoted to grade 35 , the 35th highest grade there is . Hermes , we 're having a poker party . Whip off some of your jerk dip . I spent all day cleaning my office . I got to relax the Jamaican way : warm milk and a good night 's sleep . Jamaican ? I thought you were an outer space potato man . That must be my old boss . - Hi , Leela . You 're fired . - I know . Sorry , but you 're over a year late for work . Let the games begin ! So I said , " Your request for a date is flattering , but I decline . " Office romances never work out . That 's how I met my horrible wife . You never wore your ring . I didn 't know . She doesn 't know I work . I keep my personal life separate . Deal ! You 'll have time to talk when you 're poor . - What 's with those ? - My lucky shades . I got them off a lucky guy while his lucky seeing-eye dog was whizzing . Hey ! I can 't spell anything with these cards . Finally , I have a good claw ! Three females , a number and a king giving himself brain surgery . It won 't matter how many you got . Bender 's hot . Uh , what can I say ? Must be my lucky shades . Nothing . Nothing . Crap . Crap . Garbage . Read them and leak saltwater . - Oh , man . - My baby 's milk money ! What will I tell my horrible wife ? I 'd be more worried about the tapeworm going to town on your intestines . Let me see those glasses ! Oh , my various gods ! X-ray specs ! I swear those are prescription . I need them for reading stuff . - Behind other stuff . - Cheater ! Break his neck ! No ! Don 't hurt him ! He 's my best friend- - Hey , you wouldn 't hit a guy with x-ray glasses , would ya ? Easy on the arm . Oh ! Oh , my ass ! Great cow of Moscow ! Uh , it was ghosts ! Big ones ! And a tornado ! I 'll never pass inspection now ! They 'll bust me lower than a limbo stick at carnival time ! And that 's as low as limbo sticks get . Don 't worry . We 'll watch you clean . It 's too late . The inspector 'll be here in exactly one second . - Who are you ? - Morgan Proctor , grade 1 9 . Hermes Conrad , grade 36 . - Enough banter . Shall we begin ? - This way , please . Jeez , you seem awfully calm . Don 't worry . I have a plan . I 'm going to jump ! - No ! - No ! Do a flip ! Don 't do it ! You have so much to live for ! Reverse psychology ? Old friend , don 't jump ! Use a method that won 't damage your liver . Others need it , you know ? Husband , no ! Out of my way ! I 'm not cut out to be a bureaucrat ! I 'm only anal 78.36 % of the time . I 'm not worthy to stamp a form , so I 'll stamp the cement with my body ! If you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide ... ... and / or falling permit , you 'll be demoted . Life . Death . Either way I 'm demoted to a tiny cubicle . Sweet something of- - Of someplace . I relieve you of duty . Consider yourself on paid vacation . Oh ! The ultimate penalty . I recommend the health cure on Spa 5 , the Sauna planet . Here , read . Spa 5 ? ls it good ? Wonderful . I don 't know anything about it ... ... they give me krill for everyone I send . I have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in . I assign me . I accept . Welcome . It 's settled . Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat . Last Monday , why did it take twice as long as scheduled ? - Fry got his head stuck in a crater . - I thought it 'd fit . - During this , what were you doing ? - Drinking contest with the autopilot . - I 'd have won but I ran out of olives . - I can explain . You can explain how you left without enough olives ? I think not . - Is this high school ? - Locker check ! Why isn 't this alphabetical ? - What ? - The zipper should be at the bottom . Uh , sometimes a guy gets lonely . Oh , l- - I 've never seen anything like this ! - Why 's there yogurt in this ? - I can explain . It used to be milk , and time makes fools of us all . You 're dismissed ! Fry , I 'll speak to you alone . This is the other Fry 's locker . I 'm " Phry . " Admit it , Fry . You 're a slob . A dirty , filthy slob . Dirty boy ! Dirty , dirty , dirty ! What 's going on ? I thought you were anti-dirty ! I 'm surrounded by neat all day . Nothing 's kinkier than a slop-jock . Oh , stop . Listen , you pig . No one can know . If anyone asks , I 'll deny it . Like every girl I dated . And two , and three , and four . Come on , work those arms ! This is no spa , it 's a labor camp . If I get out , Zoidberg will see the business end of a shrimp fork ! Give him one for me , mate . Don 't know why I go to him . I don 't miss twice , campers . For those six reasons ... - ... I 'm demoting Leela to copilot . - Under who ? - The autopilot . - That drunk ? Bender , you 're in charge of the professor 's bodily functions . It 's full-time . Fry , I 'm promoting you to executive delivery boy . You won 't deliver . You 'll get an office next to me . All right ! Would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting ? And on the rebound ? Adjourned . I don 't know why she 's nice to you . She 's a hateful monster . She scolded and hit me . She 's risking my friendship with her . What happened to you ? I walked the professor . We were in the park ... ... and a lady says I stole her purse . I threw the professor at her . I had to hit her with a purse I found . It 's Morgan 's fault . That pencil-pushing scaz-wag . If she were here , I 'd ... . - Uh-oh , is she behind me ? - No . I 'm in front of you . Morgan ? It 's 3 a.m. A skunk knocked over my garbage , and I could only think of you . My God , it 's so ... ... repulsive. So , this is where you eat ? Eat and sleep . Oh , Fry ! Bender 's my roommate . He could be back . I ordered him to flush out the professor 's earwax . Hey , Fry ? I made you a candle with- - What the- - ? Oh , now I see . Now I get it . Now the pieces are falling into place . The promotion , the dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions . It 's coming together ! I must say this opens my eyes ! Another case closed , my dear Watson . Come back ! It 's a loop ! For I was blind , but now I see . The cat 's out of the bag ! About last night , that was just a misunderstanding . You didn 't understand ? I 'll explain . You were having sex with you . No . A bureaucrat of my rank can 't fraternize . That 's what makes it so juicy . It 's the forbidden fruit angle . " Guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it . " They 'll say , " Who , Bender ? " And I 'll say , " It was lovable old Bender ... . " What 'd you do ? Downloaded his brain . Bender is here : His memories , his in-your-face interface . I am Bender . Please insert girder . But- - But Bender need brain . For smart making ! Stop doing things ! I sent it to be filed at Central . I had to . He was a bad robot . He was a bad friend . I want him back ! You should 've filed a request 20 years ago . I 'm sick of you and your bureaucracy ! Dirty boy ! Dirty boy ... . You were having an affair ? She loved me because I 'm a slob . I loved her because I 'm desperate . I am Bender . Please insert girder . Without his brain , he 's quiet and helpful . We have to go to Central and get the disk ! - Oh , yes . We must ! - Yeah ! Why ? Well , that aside , we 're going . You can 't waltz into Central . It 's a tangled web of red tape and regulations . I haven 't been . A friend went mad trying to find their washroom . Then we 'll need a guide . Oh , I 've been there ! Lots of times . Carts go out full but come in empty . It 's inefficient ! Pulling empty carts is the closest we get to sleep . They 'd increase efficiency ... ... if empty carts brought in machinery . Hey , I like the way you think . Oh , Lord . You know , you ought to be a bureaucrat . - Will this take long ? - Getting my birth certificate . It doesn 't look like I 'll make it inside . Good luck . Just leave me where I drop . Someone had a baby . Come on , I have a better idea . We 're from the delivery company . We 're here to deliver a robot . I am Bender . Please insert girder . Looks like we 've got a new office cutup . Ooh , ooh ! Look out , look out ! I 'm gonna crash ! I swerved to avoid you . Could you tell us where the canisters go ? Central filing . - Okay . Thank you . - Wonderful . No ! Of course I know where it is . I 'm grade 20 . - Where ? - I can 't tell . - What do I look like , a grade 1 6 ? - We 're getting nowhere slowly . I 'll address this to the filing room . We 'll track it with my lojack-a-mater . Cold . Warmer . Hot , hot , hot , hot ... . Don 't tell my boss I was asleep . This is it ! We 'll run in , grab Bender 's disk and run out . Got it ? We 'll never find it . I am Bender . Please insert girder . You 're right ! Nothing 's over if there 's hope . Lost something ? I should have known you 'd come here . And I did . That 's why I came . We 're through ! You 're evil . I never want to see you again ! Help us for old times ' sake ? He 's lost in the master " in " pile . It would take an atomic-powered sorter to find him . You rang ? Damn it , jump already ! Stop hogging the healthy liver ! I want to live ! Organizing the labor spa rekindled my love of bureaucracy . My Hermes got that hellhole running so that all the physical labor ... ... is done by a single Australian man . - How 'd you find us ? - Dr . Zoidberg . It was me ! I 'm the hero ! Request for explanation of incident meeting . Number 1 .0 ! Number 1 .0 , I petition you for an emergency sort ... ... under regulation two- - Don 't quote me regulations ! I was on a committee to review ... ... the color of the book that regulation 's in . We kept it gray . I must find the disk with my friend 's brain on it . Very well , but your license will be revoked if you fail ... ... to sort the master " in " pile by closing . - 1 p.m. - That 's only four minutes from now . Requisition me a beat . I was born , there was a hurricane We had a foot and a half of water I cried all night Blew my alphabet blocks out of order This boy 's born to be a bureaucrat Born to be obsessive and snotty I made my relations file applications To get into my birthday party - Something changed when he turned pro - Sorting but wasn ' t smiling - He forgot it 's not about rank - It 's about the filing , people We didn ' t choose to be bureaucrats That 's what almighty Jah made us Treat people like swine , make them Stand in line , even if nobody paid us The world looks down on bureaucrats We 're anal , compulsive and weird Push comes to shove , do what you love Even if it 's not a good idea - Said I shouldn ' t be a surgeon - Poo-pooed my electric frankfurter Said I shouldn ' t fly with one eye I am Bender please insert girder Everybody sing Jamaica Just the bureaucrats Just the grade 19s - Jamaica - Sing me home Push comes to shove , do what you love Even if it 's not a good idea I 'm Bender , baby ! Please insert liquor ! - Yeah ! - Congratulations ! You finished with two seconds to spare , so I 'm demoting you . Good bureaucrats never finish early . That 's okay . At least you 're back . Not yet . I 'm acting bureaucrat of Planet Express . I have some changes to make . Fry , you 're fired . - Second-- - Hold on ! While I was sorting , I found a document filed by Morgan Proctor . Form B. Notification of Romantic Entanglement . She fraternized me ! It 's not about you . It refers to my prom date . A date that ended in disappointment . Yes . But you only stamped it four times ! No ! No ! I was young and reckless ! You are technically correct . The best kind of correct . I hereby promote you to grade 37 . And as for you ? Guards ! Bring me the forms I need to sign to have her taken away . It looks like I need my heroic bureaucrat back . At severely reduced pay , of course . - Yeah ! - Better than nothing . Can I get reduced pay too ? You got it ! ln fact , severely reduced pay all around . Come on , wife ! Let 's blow this joint ! Now it 's time for my song ! When I was 2 There was a tidal wave in- - Aw ... .

 Futurama [ 5x13 ] - Bend Her - CiWaN Welcome to the games of the 3004 Earth Olympiad ! Continuing this network 's tradition of sportscasting excellence . Celebrity Ape Fight will return next week at its regular time . Who should I root for ? America ? Or a country I learned about at the food court ? How about those guys ? No . They 're from the Republic of French Stereotypes . Everybody hates them . Oh . Let 's go check on Hermes . All this inspiring multiculturalism is angrying up my blood ! Sweden ? I don 't think so . Go on , stick , touch me . Can 't do it . Husband ! You haven 't been an Olympic-Class limbo-Er for 20 years ! Quit lying to your pudgy self . It seems like Jamaica would be able to field a strong limbo team without you . Yeah . Isn 't that basically all Jamaicans do ? Jamaicans have other interests ! Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport . That 's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself . And I said I 'd try my very best . But have they seen your , you know , physique since the old days ? I described it to them on the phone using a series of artful euphemisms . Don 't worry . The fat pig will do fine ... Thanks to this Flabbo-Dynamic Spandex Body Suit I 've designed . It redistributes his weight , shifting his center of gravity closer to his knees . Ooh , that 's snug . Oh ! Those haven 't descended in years ! Now , that 's a limbo-Er 's body ! Look at that fine Jamaican bacon ! Shut up , Zoidberg ! The robot bending events are starting . Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals . Wow ! That guy must be , like , the world 's greatest bender ! My dreams of glory died before they began . Welcome to my life . Athletes , please take your lanes ... For the Men ' s 500 Meter Limbo . Hermes Conrad , is that you inside that dumpy little fat man ? Barbados Slim ! What are you doing here ? Last time I heard , you were in Barbados . Yes , and I 'll be going back there ... With a gold medal draped around my elegant Caribbean shoulders . Your body may be as perfectly sculpted as it was 20 years ago ... When you whupped my fat ass every time . But today , I feel lucky . I see you 're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense . That 's it , Barbados Slim ! You 've gone one toke over the line ! Limbo-Ers , on your marks . Get rubbery . Limbo ! There they go ! And Barbados Slim takes an early lead . God , I hope he wins . What 's this ? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap . He 's limboed out of retirement and straight into my heart . I say , " Go to hell , Barbados Slim ! " Go , body suit ! Go ! Come on ! Come on , Hermes ! Beat that mahogany god ! It 's Barbados , then Conrad . Conrad pulls ahead . And Conrad is disqualified ! Barbados Slim , my hero , takes the gold ! Oh , there , there , Hermes . You did your best . If I 'd wanted a human adonis for a husband ... I 'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim . Well , enough about Hermes . I couldn 't win a medal either . Even at bending , the thing I was built to do . I 'm so embarrassed . I wish everybody else was dead . Up next , the Fem-Bot Bending Competition . Fem-Bots ? Methinks a clever man-Bot , suitably disguised ... Might win those events . But the charade would require subtlety , nuance , grace . What do you mean I 'm not registered ? My name is Coilette , and I 'm from Robonia . Coilette 's a chick 's name . Yes . But " Robonia " sounds like something somebody made up on the spot . Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick ? Yeah . And it 's straight ! Coilette wins ! Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia ! A perfect bend and a flawless entry . No splash at all ! Perfect scores ! A record five gold medals for Coilette ! I 'm great ! Everybody else sucks ! Except that guy Bender . He 's really something . All medalists report for gender testing . You actually thought they 'd let you walk away without an engine-Oil sex check ? Oh , God ! I 'm not gonna get my medals ! They 're all I have to remember my Olympic career ! Wait ! I 've got it ! Professor , make a woman out of me ! Oh , I think we should just stay friends . I don 't need friends ! I need a sex-Change operation , and give it to me now ! Bender , a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure . Replacing your testoster-Oil with fem-Bot lubricants ... Can cause wild mood swings . And the effects may be irreversible . Well , let 's get started . No ! You can 't ! If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women- - Pfft . I 'm sorry , ladies , but I must do this . Not for you . Not for Bender . But for the proud people of Robonia ! Come on . Come on . Come on . I can 't watch this ' cause it 's creepy and wrong and sick . However , I will watch out of curiosity . Quiet ! I 'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender 's body ... Into a tender , delicate form . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Oh ! Hey ! Draining male oil . Infusing female oil . Removing item . We can 't wait for Coilette any longer ! I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes . I 'm ready for my test now , boys . Hail , hail Robonia ... A land I didn ' t make up ... Yeah , come on , baby . Take that . Goodness . Oh , yeah , baby . Come on . Work your cans . Now , shake it out . I don 't know which I 'm more : enraged or disgusted . I 'm just out there making us ladies look good . Snuh-Uh . You 're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders ! You 're not really a lady anyway , right ? Of course not . Dear Lord , a coaster ! The Femmzoil must be sashaying girlishly into your processor . Then change me back . My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway . Hello ? What ? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0 ? I 'd love to ! My own limo ? No , I don 't have my own limo . You 'd better send one . I need a rain check on that nad swap , professor . I 'm going on TV . Come on , Fry . Help me pick out a pantsuit . So , Calculon , do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits ? No , I think it 's self-Explanatory . No ! Funny story . The script called for me to say " yes . " But I gave it a little twist . Anecdote accepted . Snappy comeback not found . Please put your hands together for my next guest ... Winner of five Olympic medals , Coilette from Robonia . So , Coilette , many young fem-Bots wish to emulate you . Any advice for them ? Yes , Humorbot . If you ask me , women today are too stuck-Up ... To go out and jiggle their Jell-O like everybody wants them to . In fact , should I do it now ? Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! All right , then . Look out , baby ! Good . Work it out . Oh , shake that thing . You got to use it , lady . Shake it up a little . That 's right . Come on . Work it out . Madam , I am one impressed celebrity . Oh , I bet you say that to all the five - Olympic-Gold-Medal-Winning fem-Bots . From this day forth , I shall do so whenever possible . Golly ! What ? Coilette , this may be presumptuous That 's my favorite kind of " this . " But I would be honored if you would join me for dinner sometime . Woo . Calculon , you 'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farm girl 's fantasy . Of course I would . This top makes me look fat . Is it trampy to go on a first date nude ? Yes ! Perfect ! You 've gotta tell me . You 're not actually attracted to Calculon , right ? And if you are , don 't tell me . Are you ? Certainly not . But just once I 'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn 't bound and gagged . Is that so much to ask ? I think you dating a man-Bot is a disgrace . And I refuse to be involved . And you have way too much lipstick on . Are you kidding ? I need more lipstick ! Much more ! Yeah , that 's the stuff . Men love it when you really glob it on . No , they don 't ! No way ! Oh , please ! Every man wants a tramp . No wonder you girls aren 't married . I tell you , men are so much better at being women . But what if he wants to- - ? I mean , if he tries to- - ? Barry White ? I 'll tell him I need a commitment first . That 'll stick a potato in his tailpipe . Good Lord , man ! What kind of temporary woman are you ? Look , why don 't all of you just back off ? Can 't a girl enjoy herself without being judged ? Oh , dear ! Her mood swings are getting wilder . She 's becoming a slave to her emotions . Just like all women . Particularly you , Leela . I 'm worried about him too , professor . Hey , ma 'am , you sure can put it away . You saved me a trip to the dump . Bam ! I 'd appreciate it if you didn 't " bam " the young lady . Well , I 'd appreciate it if I did , so I guess we 're even . You know , Coilette , I 've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am . You 're such a sweet , soft fem-Bot , yet you have this free spirit about you . And there it is . It 's as if you understand the male mind better than I . I 've never met anyone like you . Oh , yes , you have . Coilette , I 'd like to spend some quality time with you . What ? Oh , no way ! Not gonna happen ! What kind of girl do you think I am ? Have I mentioned that I own the world 's biggest and most elegant yacht ? Whoo ! I 'm a trophy girlfriend ! No kidding . These gifts have been coming nonstop . I think Calculon 's falling for you . Ah , any day now he 'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy . And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff . It 's just a game . Coilette , I can 't stop thinking about you . I can 't sleep at night ! Although , as a robot , I don 't do that anyway . But if I did , I couldn 't because I love you so . Oh , my darling . Will you marry me ? Oh , Calculon . Yes , I will ! Maybe she 's right about the lipstick . I 'll miss you . You 've been like a brother and then a sister to me . And now you 're getting married . I love you , man . The marriage is a scam . Cool . What 's for dinner ? What do you mean , a scam ? I marry Calculon , divorce him ... Take half his money and turn back into a guy . It 's sort of a two-Person pyramid scheme . That 's marriage , all right . That is so unbelievably manipulative ! You never went on a date with a guy just ' cause you were hungry ? I , uh . I thought I might like him on a full stomach . Nice try , sister . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I need to meet with my wedding planner . Zoidberg ? Zoidy-Poo ? Please tell me frilly is in this year . I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life . I know I will . Late at night it taunts me with its frosted beauty . Order the cake , damn it ! I have something for you . A remote control ? You got me a TV ? No , my dearest . It 's the remote control to my heart . It symbolizes the power you have to sway my emotions . Will it work on my TV ? We don 't need TVs . We have each other . Coilette , if I weren 't able to spend my life with you ... I would leap from this very balloon . Come on with that . Really ? Yes . We were meant to be . So you really and truly love me ? So much so that I 'm prepared to give up show business itself to be with you . But you always said you 'd rather burn down a convent ... Than give up show business . I always said many things . But now all I want is a peaceful life in a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard ... With you . Would we have donkeys ? All you could eat . Oh , take me in your arms and compress me ! Compress me tight ! Stop ! Let us climb to the heavens ... That the gods themselves might envy us ! I just don 't think I can go through with this scam . What ? So now you do want to marry him ? No . I just don 't want to hurt him or humiliate him . Oh , curse this woman 's heart ! Ick . You 're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood ! You 've waited too long to switch back , you dingbat ! Okay , look , if I help you with this ... Do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out ? Uh-Huh . All right . Now , there 's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon . But he 's an actor . If there 's one kind of pain he can handle ... It 's soap opera pain . Okay , is everyone ready ? Yep ! Check . Basically . Dearly beloved actors and casting people ... Who might be looking for someone to play a preacher ... I welcome you ! The bride has written some vows ... That we will now all pretend to be interested in . Dearest Calculon , forever is not enough time ... To tell you of the many ways I love you . Oh , my ! Is there a doctor in- - ? I came as soon as I could . Oh , it appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever ! Dear God ! The very illness my TV character caught in season two ... When I was holding out for more money . It 's often fatal . Whatever happens , remember : The flame of my eternal love will burn forever . Of course . But , smoochy-Pops , I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever ... Deep in the diamond mines of the Congo . Coilette ! You she-Devil ! You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack ? Those gems belong to the natives ! Hee-Ya ! Oh , how cruel and melodramatic fate is ! Why ? Calculon , my darling , your loud " why " brought me partway back to life . Congo Jack ! Another shocking twist ! Yes ! And I have a message for you from Col. Matombay . He says , " This is from Congo Jack . " Uh , um . No . No ! N-O-O-O ! I won 't leave you . Not until I 'm sure you understand the thing I said before ... About my eternal love for you burning . Et cetera . I do . I do . Okay , then . I 'm a doctor . She 's dead . She lives no more . But let us all find comfort , knowing that she truly loved me . To honor my pain , I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory . And this time , the Academy will not deny me . Not when they see Coilette : The Calculon Story . Coilette , your death fills me with sorrow , anger , fear . Every emotion an actor can display . Turn off that crap-O-Rama ! One mistake and Bender will be trapped forever ... Between the already ill-Defined robot sexes . Ow ! Ooh ! Ow ! Ah ! I hope this taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win gold medals . It truly has . My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself . Almost done . If only somehow , some way ... He and I could drive to Vegas , pick up some floozy-Bots ... And void their warranties all night long ! Whoo ! Yay ! My buddy 's home ! And his respect for women is back to normal . I hoped this experience would have left you more open to your sensitive side . Yeah , you 'd think , but what you gonna do ? Coilette , the skies themselves weep ... Upon the sweetest flower of all the field . Ew . Blech . Sentimental dribble poop ! Come on , Bender , let 's go . This chick flick is getting me all barfy . Yeah . Emotions are dumb and should be hated . Good night forever , my turtledove . Good night , Calculon . What did you say ? I said , " You two don 't dress trampy enough ! " I still got it .

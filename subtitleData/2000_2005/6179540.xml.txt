 Previously on Farscape . And finally on Farscape . Your infantile obsession with betrayal is misplaced , John . Aeryn : Scorpius actually said that ? Can you believe the son of a bitch did actually say that ? Look past my actions , towards my goal . Our common goal . He leads Braca and a damn Command Carrier here and no , I have an infantile obsession with betrayal . Should you initiate Starburst , your ship will be crippled . If Scorpius is harmed in any way , the Leviathan will be destroyed . We have Braca sitting on our front doorstep issuing threats with one hand , and Scarran messages with the other . But no , no , no , I 'm sorry . It 's not a betrayal . Do you believe them ? Yes . No . I ... Maybe . I don 't know . Look , I can understand if you ... if you didn 't want to , but it is possible that they 're telling the truth . Crazy as it sounds , that the message was ... was intercepted from the decimated Scarran base on Katratzi . Our course is set for the wormhole that leads to Crichton 's home planet . Upon arrival , begin the process of subduing their defensive forces . Just tell me the Scarrans don 't know where Earth is . They 'll go . Crystherium Utilia . An acquired taste . Hummingbird feeder . You know of our delicacy . Crichton : Bird of Paradise . Yeah , Mom 's garden . Dime a dozen . I know they 're gonna go . They 're gonna go because I told 'em their flowers were there . That being the case , perhaps we should set aside how we feel about Scorpius and listen to what he 's proposing . No , absolutely not . No . He ... he 's manipulated us , Aeryn . He manipulates everything . This , us . From the first moment we met , the man has done nothing but lie to us . I know . But what if the Scarrans are heading to Earth ? What if they really are ? What else did he say to you ? I assure you , I had nothing to do with this , John . That said , reality ... presents opportunity , John . That if I ally myself with the Peacekeepers , he will ... will see to it that our entire might is thrown into defending your world . Well , that 's something you have to consider . No , I don 't . I can destroy the wormhole . Seal up Earth . You can do that ? Yes , no , maybe again . The knowledge is there , it 's just not in the correct order . All right , but what if they make it there before you ? What if they beat you there ? What happens to your family ? Everyone ? Make a decision , John . You have nothing to fear from this commitment . It 's a big commitment . Either one . So you 're ... What ? Afraid . Of commitment ? Hey , wait a minute . Did she just hesitate like that , or was that just you doing that now ? What does it matter ? - Well , it matters because if she hesitated like that , she knows you were talking about her . You said what ? What I said . Like you said ? - What does it matter ? Well if you said it to him like you said it when you said it to me , then it means that he knows that you know . Now is not a good time to be talking commitment , with Peacekeepers . Earth is not ready . Will they ever be ? One day . Maybe . So you got out of it ? Oh , please . No , really . Because , uh , if she paused like that ... I don 't wanna talk about it . So what do we do ? We hope . We hope that I can figure out how to destroy the wormhole . Otherwise , all the bad things happen , and it 'll be my fault . Well , I 'm with you . Good job . Always position yourself so they have to come to you . Chiana , this isn 't about us . Sure . Ready ? Yeah . We are natural allies , John . The Scarrans will ravage your planet , and I can prevent it . Miss Britannica , what kind of Scarran ship is following us ? A Stryker , John . Swift attack . It 's gonna beat us to the wormhole ? Utilizing Starburst ? Possibly . What about Braca and the Queen Mary ? No . Grasshopper , tell me your plan for saving Earth . By a simple declaration of alliance . Even infuriated , Emperor Staleek would be forced to stay his attack , or by its inception , incur a war that he is still afraid of losing . Your timing is terrible . It 's too late . ( beeping ) Welcome to the nuclear age . John , see reason . No , I am no longer a chess piece . Crichton , he is not wrong . You must trust him . Goldilocks , it 's a bad choice . When you figure that out , call our 1-800 number for counseling . D 'Argo : Okay , Chiana . Lock down the Maintenance Bay . Good riddance . - You two better grab your helmets . Captain Braca , here 's the deal . We 've attached a bomb to Scorpius and we 're leaving . Follow us and the bomb explodes . Once we 've gone , the bomb will shut down . Couldn 't be simpler . Don 't bother responding . We 're not listening . Scorpius : Explain to me the logic of resisting the Scarrans without allies . I see . Reason has fled them all . So much you misunderstand about me , John . Your actions put your world at risk . I did this . I 'll fix it . And live with it either way . Sikozu : Weak species ! Scorpius : John reconsider ! Otherwise you doom Earth to destruction ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Ahkna : Why send a Stryker force to Earth ? For impotent revenge against Crichton , or to separate me from my lover ? We are political enemies , you and I. But Scarrans both . Do you have the fortitude to ally yourself for a greater good than your own advancement ? You destroyed my father . Your political office , the bounty of your rank , were stolen . Just as he took from his predecessor . You must put that aside . What does it matter ? The Hierarchy shall judge us both harshly . The Crystherium matriarch is gone . This region of the galaxy denied to us . A partnership . Your lover , Pennoch , travels to Earth , Ahkna , because these grow there . D 'Argo : John , at this range , Pilot could still contact Scorpius . But after one more Starburst , he ... No turning back . I think you should concentrate on your training with Katoya . Katoya was a frelling fruit loop . Focus on your inner strength . It 's here . I just can 't find the Rosetta Stone . Katoya . Fruit loop . Sex . Chiana . Sex does it . For you ? - For everyone . Sex . With you , or with him ? Whatever . Sex . John ... this is hard to say but , ah , not all of the Peacekeepers are represented by Grayza 's betrayal . If you make a pact with Scorpius , I believe they 'll honor it . And then they won 't enslave your planet . Thanks . It 's not a 12 . It 's not 12 . Pilot , how come we haven 't Starburst ? We need Starburst ! Scarran Stryker craft have a unique propulsion system that allows them to cover great distances . - And ? We require three additional Starbursts to reach the destination . At our current rate , they will arrive before us . Moya and I have discussed the options , and elect to employ an extended Starburst technique . Extended Starburst ? ( grunting ) Noranti : You look awful . I can 't think . Oh , this extended Starburst is much worse than Pilot expected . Rygel is vomiting continuously , though perhaps that 's not so unusual . On the other hand , Stark has passed out , which is just as well , ' cause now he can 't vomit at all . Would you leave me alone for a while ? Momentarily . Chew . No thank you . It decreases the symptoms . How fares the wormhole ? Can you close one down ? Noranti , would you leave us , please ? I know of one sure curative for brain lock . Natural , - Come on . organic , drugs . - Please . How is your nausea , dear ? - Better , thank you . Good . I can take a hint . I was looking for you in Maintenance Bay . I liked your solution . Liked that , did ya ? Mm-hmm . You have any home remedies for writer 's block ? I know you better than that . ( sighs ) I 'm gonna fail . It 's a sin , really . I 'm close . There 's just not enough time . It 's always about time . Yeah . Time . Timing . Timing . Love you . Don 't ever change . Pilot , proof me on this . If I can . Remember , I 'm a bit woozy myself from extended Starburst . I 'll have Grandma whip you up something . A wormhole is a disturbance in space-time . Immediately before it opens , a pressure bubble forms . You can 't see it , but it 's there . I can see it . You can see the bubble ? Yes . Can 't you ? I kinda smell it . Any-Anyway , you know what I 'm talking about . The bubble starts tiny and it expands outward . When the bubble bursts , the wormhole opens . - Correct . All right . Here 's my theory . Stop me if you 've heard it before . I travel down the wormhole to Earth in my module . The wormhole closes behind me , I wait . Before the wormhole opens , I dive in at the last moment piercing the bubble . That collapses the wormhole in around me , over and over and over again , all the way back to here . The wormhole is sealed up forever . Closed . Finito . Road gone . Hmm ... That is brilliant , Commander . It 'll work . The math is impeccable . The quantical relationships line up perfectly . Ah . Am I sensing a problem ? The Scarrans are on their way , Pilot . The timing required to puncture the bubble at its maximum radius , thereby beginning the chain reaction you describe , is in the mili-microts . So , I can 't do it ? Even if you could see the bubble , your eye-limb coordination is lacking . I 'm not gonna ask you another favor , so I 'm just gonna beg . ( sighs ) Commander , I 'm sorry . There 's nothing I can do . Oh ... Chiana : All over . Finally . Outstanding , Pilot . My congratulations to you and to Moya . Chiana : No sign of the Scarrans . We beat ' em . I 'm coming with you . Aeryn , we got one shot at the wormhole before the Scarrans arrive . Pilot 's explained this maneuver to me . He 's not very optimistic . If it doesn 't work , we could be stuck on Earth . There are worse places . Not if the Scarrans get there . Then we 'll have to do the best we can . What did you imagine for your life ? Service , promotion , retirement , death . You ? This is exactly what I imagined . And a couple of kids . Ah , Dominar . You should do it . Would you ? No . But I 'm not you . Braca : Allow me to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am to have you back onboard , sir . Delightful to be here , Captain . Is Commandant Grayza not joining us ? No . No , she 's having a little difficulty adjusting to her confinement . Apparently , she 's under sedation . Pity . The next time we encounter Crichton , see to it that the older cook is brought aboard , unharmed . Do you wish me to continue to track his movements and pursue him ? Unnecessary . I believe our reluctant human may soon return ... of his own volition . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Four years ago , I got shot through a wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy . I ended up on this ship , this living ship , populated by escaping prisoners who became my friends . Harvey : Curious holiday , Easter . Religious leader dies , comes back from the dead and you end up celebrating like this . I made enemies . Harvey : John ... Not now , you son of a bitch . This is not ... the time ... to be messing with me ! ( grunting ) You want me to fail , don 't ya ? Quite the contrary , John . Should your planet fall victim , I would not wish to reside in the head that blames itself . Then why ? I 've examined this thoroughly from my unique perspective . And I believe your fears are correct . I believe you will fail . After all that 's happened , how do you expect me to trust you ? Well , I think that , like religion , is an individual choice . Either you believe and therefore , bunnies are unnecessary or you don 't , in which case , chocolate ! Hey . Crichton , what are you doing ? Contacting Scorpius . Change of plan . John . - What ? I 'm gonna see if I can cut a deal before the Scarrans get here and avert a massacre . ( chuckling ) Are you really sure this is what you wanna do ? I can 't risk Earth . What the hell 's the matter with these consoles ? Why are you doing this ? Why would you sell your own people out ? Because I am proud to bring Peacekeeper protection to my backward-ass little planet ? Then don 't do it ! Pop the frelling bubble . Make the wormhole collapse . Pip , I can 't do it . - Yes , you can . I 'm not smart enough . - Yes , you can . I 'm not fast enough . I am not alien enough . And you know what ? There are people in the universe who don 't like me . I 'm only human . - Frell you ! ( scoffs ) To ... victory over Scarran domination . Scorpius : To you . Your bravery . For resisting the enemy ? For not resisting ... your friends . ( moans ) ( Sikozu moaning , Scorpius growling ) ( Pilot hyperventilating ) Calm down , Pilot . Breathe . ( breathing slows ) That 's it . Now , tell me what the matter is . Moya and I have never been at greater odds . We 've never disagreed so fiercely . Over what , Pilot ? I haven 't been entirely honest about not being able to help Crichton . You ! Sparky , you selfish , egotistical , self-centered little Dominar . Pilot said it was you that turned him around . Do you want to pay me back ? We 'll see how it turns out . - Ow ! Ooh ! But I love your scaly green ass , no matter what . Pilot : Moya is enormously distressed by what we are about to do . Tell her she must be brave . It 's for the good of the family . Pilot , how 's this gonna work ? Pilot : Because the Transport Pods are built of Moya 's own elements , I will be able to live in one for up to an arn . But if we are not rejoined by then , both wounds will scab over , and our neurological connections will have no chance of regenerating . We 're gonna be quick . We go , wormhole closes , we wait . Before it opens again , we pop the bubble and we 're back home . If not , my death is assured . And without Moya . I shall die alone . Stark : You won 't be alone , Moya . He shall return . And I 'm here . We 're all here . This will help you to relax . Aeryn ? Most life-sustaining systems are on manual bypass . Ready as can be . Rygel : Then do it , if you 're going to do it . Cap 'n ? Pip ? D 'Argo : Okay , Pilot . I really need to hear this from you . Captain D 'Argo , I remand this ship to your control . You may now cut me free of Moya . ( sighs ) ( controls winding down ) ( agonizing screaming ) ( Stark screaming ) ( screaming echoing ) Noranti : It 's not working ! Stop ! It 's not working ! Stop ! Stop ! What ? What 's wrong ? He can 't take anymore . He 's getting delirious . Well , what do you expect ? We 're cutting him in half Oh no , not Pilot , the other one . Listen . Stark : Too much . It 's too fast . It makes no sense . I can 't remember . It 's too much sequentially coded . - Mine . Stark : There 's too much . It 's all an impossible pattern . It 's too much . Helpless . Help me . Stark ! - Help me . ( crying ) ( grunting ) Oh ! - What is the matter ? It 's too much . Too fast . - Okay , all right . Chiana , these command sequences must be performed while I am separated from Moya . Without them , most regulatory systems will fail . Okay , you said ... you said you flew Talyn . Oh , I did . There . Sat there . Flew Talyn . Controlled Talyn . Was Talyn . So ? Way more complicated . Four arms . It 's too fast . Too much . Okay , Pilot , can you slow it down for him ? There is no time . All right . Then show me and I 'll slow it down . ( shuttering ) Stark : Your eyes . What did you do ? Your job . I 'm blind . Tell Crichton we 're ready . Thank you , Chiana . They 're putting Pilot inside the Transport Pod . He doesn 't look well . Noranti : I 've fortified him , with antiinfectious ointment and pain relief . Though I fear both to be wholly inadequate in this case . What is this dren ? Keep the neural circuits moist till Moya and Pilot are rejoined . Don 't hold your breath . This isn 't even one you could get odds on . Aeryn : This moisturizing agent won 't work for long . The ganglia is already drying out . Wormhole cycle 's gonna start in about 30 microts . You might wanna grab onto something . John . Aeryn . The Scarrans are less than an arn away . Good luck . Dear God , don 't let me screw this up . ( quietly ) : Yee-ha . ( rhythmic breathing ) Aah , Dad . Huh . You sentimental son of a bitch . Aeryn : Pilot ? We 're gonna need you to wake up now . We need your help . ( groaning ) Come on , John . Jack : There is no way that 500 egghead scientists are strapping on a handgun as part of their uniform . So help me out here , Winters . Make all this crap go away . ( phone ringing inside ) I 'm coming . ( ringing continues ) Hello . Crichton : Hey , Dad . John , where are you ? Serenity Base . Serenity Base ? - Yeah , the Moon . Why didn 't you make Earth orbit ? Murphy , Dad . We 've got a little problem . Worse than a $ 300 clipboard that you can put paper in when it 's upside-down ? Yes . The Scarrans have located Earth . And they 're on their way . What can we do ? Nothing . I gotta do it . What the hell 's that mean ? Why do you have to do it ? You 've already done enough , son . I 'm gonna seal up the wormhole . That 'll isolate Earth , but it should protect it . Then how do we get into deep space ? The old-fashioned way . You build a rocket . I 've left you technology and navigation information here at your flagpole . How long do we have ? Not long . Then take me with you . Take us all . We 're ready . 500 of the world 's best . We can help . There 's no time . - What do you mean , there 's no time ? For Moya to get from the Moon to the Earth , what 's it take ? Blink of the eye ? Two seconds ? Come on , son ! We 're down to minutes , Dad . How do you wanna spend ' em ? Son . Listen , the Secretary General of the U.N. is ... he speaks for the planet on all space matters now . We 're starting to come together , just like you wanted . That 's good . Keep that up . I was looking forward to going with you , boy . Well , sometimes things don 't happen quite the way you imagine ' em . ( quietly ) : Come on . Tell Suse and Liv that ... I love ' em . And I 'll contact ya if I can . Tell everyone . I will , son . You tell my grandkids about me . Ha . That 's a no brainer . They gotta know who my hero is . You 're gonna find ... when you have your own , you want ' em to pass you . Be better , climb higher . I guess if that 's the measure , I 'm the greatest dad on Earth . I love you , Dad . ( voice cracking ) : You 're the heart and soul of my life , son . I love you . Goodbye . Stark , can we move the ship ? Moya seems too dazed to respond to anyone but Pilot for navigation . D 'Argo ? The Scarrans will be here momentarily . No , no , no ! Scarrans ! Scarrans torture ! Scarrans kill ! Torture , kill ! Torture , kill ! ( screams ) Stark ! I think I 'm okay now . Pennoch : Emperor Staleek . The wormhole has reappeared as we approach . Scans show Crichton 's Leviathan sits nearby , though it makes no attempt to flee or defend itself . Staleek : Ignore them . Continue on to Earth . Fulfill your mission . They 're here ! Everyone brace ! ( yelling and grunting ) Pennoch : I have crippled their ship . Aeryn : Up , Pilot . Now . Come on , Pilot , up and at ' em . You got billions of lives to save . Did I ... did I miss it ? - No . Did I let you down ? - No , you did not . All right , listen up . Right there . Where ? - Right there . It 's gonna be a wormhole back to Moya , and just pop the bubble when it 's ... when it 's time . - At its apex . Yes , Commander . You know what scares the hell out of me ? From the first moment I laid eyes on you , I could never see the end . What scares me is I always could . All right Pilot , time it right . I see it , Commander . The bubble preceding your wormhole is forming now . Beginning acceleration sequence . Wormhole in quatro ... tres ... dos . Please ... work . ( engines roaring ) Now ! I don 't know if this is gonna work . - Scarrans ! Disengage . Disengage ! ( crashing thud ) Uh ! Son of a bitch ! Emperor , Crichton has turned the wormhole against us . We will not ... ( screaming over comms ) ( engines winding down ) Damn baby , you 're alive . Stark : You did a good thing today , Pilot , for which the goddess always rewards . Float on memories , and time will heal your wounds . - Empty ... And should you ever need to leave again , don 't hesitate in calling on me . - Discharge ... I was your worthy successor . I was ! You ask Moya . When the Scarrans shot her , I seized control and saved the ship ! I know you 're proud . Troubled Stykera , float on memories , and perhaps time will heal your wounds . Pilot : ... discharge ... pumps ... Noranti : Head down . Discharge ... Yes , yes , Pilot . D 'Argo has switched on the pumps . Any water seepage will be expelled . Thank you . Now , allow the minerals in Qujaga 's sea to soothe Moya , and you rest and regenerate your connection to her . ( grunts softly ) How many fingers ? Hmm ? ( screaming ) Two ! - Hey , whoa ! Oi ! Oh . - Tralk ! It 's not gonna go away . ( gasping ) I 'm gonna be blind forever . Frell . ( frustrated groan ) Hey . That Diagnosan that we found near here , that is the first stop that we make when this is over , I promise . Rygel : Simpletons . What ? Chiana : What 's going on ? Rygel : Crichton 's got Aeryn in a boat . What 's he doing ? We have some unfinished business . Yes , we have . A year ago , we let a coin make our decisions for us . Not again . Call it . Aeryn . I have a question . Can I go first ? Yeah . When I was on the Command Carrier , I went to see a surgeon . I was really worried about what the Scarrans did to me . The fetus has been released from its stasis . So I 'm having a baby . You okay ? And the baby ? It 's yours . I just wanted to tell you . Hope it doesn 't change anything . Um ... Well it changes everything . We 're gonna have ... a baby ! Yeah ! Frell you ! We are gonna have ... a baby ! Wha ... what 's going on ? Now , John seems very , very angry . We 're having a baby ! Come sit down before you fall down . Ah , ha ! Are you all right ? - Yeah . Oh . Are you happy ? - Yeah . What was your question ? Oh , God . Um ... Crichton 's gone down onto his knees . Why ? I think he 's hurt himself . Will you marry me ? Yes . ( laughs ) Oh ... What 's he doing ? Uh , the boat 's sinking . The ring . He 's putting some sort of ... looks like a ring on her finger . A ring ? D 'Argo : A ... A ring . ( Chiana chuckles ) You frelnicks . Didn 't you watch any of those ... th-th-those Earth movies ? Crichton just proposed . Hmm ? Proposed what ? Marriage . Marriage ? Idiot ! Oh ! ( rumbling ) ( loud whoosh ) John ! Aeryn ! Get inside ! D 'Argo , do you know what it is ? I have no idea whatsoever . Just come back inside ! Crichton : Give me a break . We 're in a boat ! Tracker Scouts were correct . One Leviathan , partially submerged . Two invaders have exited their ship . Request orders . Are they gonna make it ? ( gasps ) D 'Argo ! Qujagan ( over comms ) : Do you have target acquisition ? Positive . I scan no armaments . Neutralize invaders for analysis . Acknowledged . Neutralization run , beginning . Hatch doors are open ! Hurry up ! You and your timing . I love you . No ! ( agonized scream ) : No ! ( screaming ) ( sobbing wail ) ( wind blowing ) ( distant rumbling ) ( loud whoosh )

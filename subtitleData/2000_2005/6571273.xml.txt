 Starring : Yosuke Eguchi Miwako Ichikawa Yoshio Harada Takashi Kashiwabara Yukiko Okamoto Haruhiko Kato Yasuko Matsuyuki Akira Emoto George Iida How terrible for the earth and the sea ! The Devil has come down to you , and he is filled with rage , as he knows that he has such little time left . ( Chapter 12 , the Revelation to John ) ANOTHER HEAVEN Watch your step . Nice smell . Maybe stew . Did the landlord inform us ? Yeah . He was laughing . What ? Laughing ? When shocked , guys act in an odd way . This place is new . But no one will rent it after this . If TV reports this place , it 'll be finished . The body seems fairly clean . He 's new . Nice smell , eh ? Stew ? Evidently the victim 's a good cook . It 's a clue . May I take a look ? Pork-no-chicken stew . Sure smells good . How nice ! Makes me hungry . Behave . There 's a stiff here . Inspector Tobitaka and Dr. Akagi are coming . Old Akagi too ? Let 's light it . Be careful . Please ! Sorry . Look . His head 's empty . An insult to the dead ! It 's really empty . What ? He has no brains . Then ... where are they ? The brains . Hey , hey ! Is it that terrible ? What 's with you ? Manabu ! What 's this nice smell ? Awful ! Let 's go . What 's with him ? The worst case I ever saw was a severed penis in the corpse 's mouth . How base ! I remember seeing a similar neck injury . A zoo breeder was killed by a gorilla 20 years ago . Then a gorilla did that too . A gorilla chef . A gourmet too . How can you talk like that ? Ass ! I 'm shocked , too . I doubt it . Inspector ! There 's a tubious man . Say " dubious . " He lives next door . Can 't make it out . Speak clearly ! Sorry . It tastes like cheese . He ran ! Hey , wait ! To the rear ! Let go of me ! I didn 't do it . Who said you did ? Knock it off ! You said the killer was strong and a good cook . You 're trying to pin it on me , huh ? You 're nice and strong . Does it matter ? It sure does . What do you do ? A butcher . So what ? Butcher , eh ? I slice meat and sell it . I cook stew to sell , too . My stew is tasty , they say . Anyway , what 's it to you , huh ? He did it . Dear ! Hey , stop ! This is where the murder occurred . Judging from the victim 's injury , the killer was a man weighing over 100 kg . He had a grip of over 150 kg . Don 't mention his cooking . We 'll get started . Bizarre Murder Cases Not bizarre crimes . The guy killed his victims instantly . The butcher 's innocent . Know why the neighbor was killed ? He rushed in when the killer was cooking . He broke his neck and threw him out . He got mad ? He 's sadistic and loses his temper easily . Why so sure ? A woman in the room . He 'd been sent to paradise once . He arranged flowers too . He had lots of call girl fliers , but ... Who 's she ? Dr. Sasamoto at the police hospital . She was watching Manabu . Not a call girl . He had porno videos . He hid them from her . I don 't think he had a woman ... unlike you . Who do you mean ? A cabaret hostess . That ? Name was Asako . Small fingerprints . The killer was big . So , the killer was a beauty . Small hands , but she weighs over 100 kg . Is that it ? Nonsense . The killer was a man . Inspector ! Inspector ! Another murder ! Another empty head ! Stew again ? No . Meat loaf ? Spaghetti sauce . Let 's go ! Hell ! My favorite food ! The fingerprints . We 'll probably get more stiffs like this . Inedible food too . Another victim was discovered . The total number is ... five now . How long must it go on ? TV-shows too much brutality . It invites crime . Too much violence appears in novels and movies . As children grow , such scenes become ingrained . They must be outlawed . Was I dreaming ? Had a nightmare ? I was watching you . How did you get in ? The door was open . What a careless cop ! The murder cases ? Get out . Your case was closed . Why must we meet ? He was cooking ? Then " she . " Not " he . " Don 't look . Why believe the killer 's a man ? No man can be such a good cook . Some men can . They 're good cooks . Only girls learn cooking of this sort . She must be a beauty . She can hook a man easily . She arranges flowers too . A woman can 't break a man 's neck . It 's hard for a man , too . How did she do it ? It 's simple . What ? Her superhuman power . It 's possible . I thought about it , too . You 're lying . It fits in perfectly . She had sex . But someone used physic power . With human hands . He needed too much strength for a woman . Not superhuman power . Is that so ? You think so , Manabu ? Don 't " Manabu " me . Now , get out . I have special ability . Like what ? A keen sense . I can tell how people feel . Nonsense ! How you feel , too . Leave . You came to my place , too . To investigate . After I busted your man ... He wasn 't my man . Only to investigate ? After that , I met you five times in town ... by chance . That didn 't start anything like " love . " I have work to do . I 'm tired , too . Leave , huh ? All right . My bag . I 'm sure it was a woman . Manabu ? You 're really tired . Poor guy ! Hey . Stop it . Let 's do it . All right , eh ? I love you . A voluntary teacher for the handicapped ? He 's the seventh victim . Found in ... A vinegared stew ? His parents were killed in an accident . He got their money and started volunteering ? He was unfortunate . He wanted to help people from their misery . You want to do the same ? No . Did you suffer misfortune ? My parents ' divorce . It took me long to overcome it . Divorce makes children loose and lascivious . You mustn 't say that . Why not ? What about you ? Ass ! What 's that red stuff ? How could you do that ? What a shame ! A UFO room , eh ? UFOs exist . Seen one ? Think Earth 's a globe ? Of course ! Seen it ? TV and photos . Even babies know . I saw UFOs on TV and in photos . Manabu . You 're a cop , eh ? So what ? Cops mustn 't believe in UFOs . Wake up ! Sorry . My teacher told me to come . That 's all right . Come out . Chi-chan stayed here for three days . She wanted to do naughty things with him . He didn 't want to . But one day Chi-chan got on him by force . After that , she cut open his head like this . She cut it open . I was scared ! He wasn 't thinking anything bad . He wasn 't tasty . She said so . Tell his school . Did he see it ? Don 't ask me ! Sir ! Where are you ? Why run away ? Where are you ? Sir ? Where are you going ? Sir ! Wait , sir ! Don 't run ! No ! No ! Missing people get mixed up in crime . They aren 't felons . I know . Believe in UFOs and ghosts ? Enough ! Why deny what really happened ? We can 't believe in everything . We can 't ask ghost for help . How mulish ! In the first place , how could a woman rape a man ? Found her ? Here ! Chizuru Kashiwagi , a college student . She became missing three days before the first case . She 's " Chi-chan . " She 's weird . She okay ? Be patient . I 'm sure we can do anything to her . It 's for sure . What 'll we do ? Don 't force yourself to drink . Sorry . No butter . Don 't I have any ? What about salad oil ? No . I 'll go buy some . No . I 'll go . Don 't bother . I 'll go myself . Excuse me . Hurry . What 're you cooking ? Something delicious . I need more ingredients . Slice the fish yourself ? The fish are lucky . Sorry . Be patient . Hey , Chizuru ... Don 't move so fast . I can hear . Hear what ? Your bad thoughts . It 's fun to open a head . Bad thoughts change brains ' color . And ... it 's reflected in hair , too . I realized it only lately . Your hair 's stiff . I don 't like this . I bought butter . Well ? Where are they ? They 're resting . Resting ? Hey , wait a minute . What ? I 'll use a rubber . It 's for your sake , too . Why must everyone provoke me ? Afraid of disease ? No . About disease ... only the living need to worry . Help ! Help ! Five on the balcony , four on the veranda . Seven at the fire escape . One in the basement car park . Two in every corridor . Okay ? We 're ready . Let 's go . He says a Chizuru did it . The informer ? Who can tell ? This way . It 's open . Over there too ! Call an ambulance ! No brains . It 's empty . Cool down ! Where 's the killer ? Cool down first . Let 's look for the killer and more victims . Cold ... cold ... You okay ? Be brave ! A blanket ! Police . You 're all right . Your name ? Kimura ... it 's Kimura . You 're all right . The gal 's dead . There was no one else here . Meaning ? The killer was ... Chizuru . You said she couldn 't be . I realize she was ! Her brains are gone . How could she kill ? At least her heart was beating . A blanket . A college student killed a man and cooked his brains . And her brains got lost , too . Unbelievable ! Saying there 's another killer ? Where 's he ? Tell me ! Noisy kid ! What 's up ? What is it ? Lovely hair ... COLLEGE STUDENT SUSPECTED OF MURDER Going out ? You like me ? Why ask ? Just tell me . Your face . Stay in bed . What 's up ? All you see is ... how I look . I want you to be as you look . It 's obvious . What about you ? What ? What do you like ... about me . I don 't know . You asked me first . Let 's go . Together ? Where to ? Just get up . What happened here ? Chizuru became missing . She 'd been with a friend . She was standing there . Three days later , the murders began . She was studying cooking and flower arrangement . She had thin wrists . She broke men 's necks ? Her brains were gone , too . Yet , the police ... tried to decide she was the killer . They believe only what they can see . The killer ran . Ran ? Not Chizuru . Something evil ran from her head . She 's a good girl . She was so obedient that she grew frustrated . She was under stress . So evil attracted her . Frustrated ? It 's just a lump of stone . I detest enduring things . Her father wants her back . Her brains weren 't gone . They shrank and dried up in a corner . Filled with ulcers , too . Brain ulcers ? How could she live until now ? How could she walk ? I want to keep such a rarity here . She was ill ? How could she have killed ? But she really did it . There 's physical evidence . She wasn 't a big man . Her potentiality . A mother lifts a car to save her kid . That 's absurd ! That doesn 't matter . Two guys were almost killed by Chizuru . She was arrested and died . Case closed . It 's over . Let me say this again ... No thanks . Without brains , how could she think ? Yet she did . That 's a fact . Still arguing ? Mr. Hayase . A phone call for you . Hello ? Manabu ? Who is this ? Hello ? Chizuru was standing before that statue , eh ? You Kimura ? How did you know ? Think . You 'll know the answer . Answer ! How did you know ? I have a gift for you . A gift ? Room 1009 , Hotel Excellent . My gift for you . Kimura ! Hey ! A crime buff . He tapped into our radio . Guys like that are around . Open it . " For Beloved Manabu " Brains did it ! Look for the killer . Chizuru 's brains moved to Kimura . So he did the same . Nonsense . Move ! Hello ? Mysterious , eh ? Why copy what Chizuru did ? I knew you 'd say so . Stupid ! Shut up ! Damn you ! There ! Manabu . Stairs . Freeze ! Don 't move ! You ass ! Who 's the woman ? I don 't know . I picked her up . Inspector ! I 'm happy . This world 's wonderful ! Knock it off ! Damn him ! Hey , Manabu ! " I let myself drift in a current . " " I wonder where I 'll end up . " Manabu . I missed you . Don 't " Manabu " me ! Go ahead . Shoot , Manabu ... Finally we meet again . How terrific ! You look great . Damn you ! Freeze ! You can 't shoot , eh ? Shoot ! Go ahead ! Shoot ! I hit him . Let 's go down ! Where is he ? He must be dead . He really ran away ! Tell them to shoot him . Just shoot him . Explain first . Shut up ! Him ! He 's crazy ! The car ! What 's he doing ? Baiting us . Some guy ! Don 't overdo it , Pop . Shut up ! You got better at shooting . Just by chance . Shoot his groin . He kissed you . I 'll kill him . This is Hayase . I 'm at the condominium ... Is murder bad ? Of course ! Of course ? TV 's filled with murder . Murder takes place in dramas , movies and news . Everyone 's bored . They crave fun . Life without murder 's boring to you too , eh ? What are you ? What am I ? A spaceman ? Spaceman , eh ? Answer . It 's only today 's humans that think of space wars . " Drop bombs to protect us ! " I 'm human , a real human . No kidding ! I 'm not kidding . I 'm a human . I know ... that you can understand me . No humans have your power . We 're friends . Let 's play together . I 'm not gay . Then what do you like ? Lay off him , Manabu ! No problem . Bruises and three cracked ribs . It 's not a problem ? Just lie still . Your brains are all right , too . Lie still ? For a week , at least . A problem . Why ? The case is almost closed , right ? The killer 's seriously wounded ? That inspector shot an unarmed man three times . I shot him , too . He wasn 't armed , eh ? A spaceman ... I mean him . I 'll check your brains again . Do so . I was joking . There you are ! Excuse me . Leave ! What ? Excuse me . You stay . She 's leaving . I came just now . I 'll leave . Take care . I 'm not leaving . Why the sunglasses ? To be incognito . You won 't be . I looked everywhere for you . Does it hurt ? Yeah . I was in danger . Thought I 'd die . Don 't say that . That reminds me . You were right . The killer . What was he ? I don 't know . He enters a human head . Said he was a human . A human ? Said I 'm his friend . A friend ? A friend . He didn 't mean to kill me . What 's " friend " ? I 'm not helping people . Meaning ... ? I 'm just a crime buff . A crime buff ? I listened to police radios and phones . I rushed to the scene . I was a student then . Everything was real . Real crimes were great . I liked it . The evil enchanted me . So I became a cop . I 'm not helping people . He realized it . I never mentioned it . But ... But what ? You helped me once ... from bad people . I didn 't mean to . It was my job . That 's all . What 's going on ? Too defensive ? Damn it ! What 're you doing ? What 're you doing , guys ? To see him . Shut up , chick ! Can 't you tell what you 're doing ? A cop mustn 't touch an ex-con ! The way you talk ! Get out ! Manabu . Leave . Snap it up ! Get lost ! Never come again ! Ass ! Don 't come anymore ! Inspector ! A body ! A body ! Where ? At the basement entrance . Basement ? Hey , stay in bed ! Snoop for information . Excuse me . Not Kimura . Brains ? In her head . Why does Kimura kill ? He imitates other killers . Nonsense ! He didn 't use that woman . He didn 't like her . Unlike you , he 's choosy . And where is he now ? You mean the real killer ? Maybe in someone else . Everyone 's in danger . What can we do ? Why the hospital ? Kimura loves Hayase . Don 't say that . Get out of here quick ! Search this hospital ! Who is it ? Asako ? Go away . Open up . Didn 't I tell you to lie still for a week ? I must check on you regularly . Understand ? You have bruises and cracked ribs . I 'm sorry but I had a reason . The murder ? You cops tend to make your own rules . Listen . I must go . Your injury 's worse than you think . Undress and get in bed . You 're a patient . Kimura 's body ... ? Still missing . He may be alive . But he 's injured . He doesn 't care . You know that . You 're learning . Shut up ! The investigation ... ? Pure routine , that 's all . Can you explain ? Explain what ? Something unknown gets into brains and kills . You guys seem to be a good pair now . I gave a name to the unknown thing . What name ? " Something . " Because we don 't know what it is . He called himself " human . " Absurd ! Even this inspector won 't believe it . Are you praising me or not ? There 's a clue for " Something . " Like what ? Brain ulcers need morphine for therapy . Morphine 's available only at hospitals . A nurse or doctor ? Who knows ? Cops can get it , too . Another clue . What ? This " Something " will approach you . Maybe it 's in a woman of your type . Not Asako . One you 'd fall for . What 's up ? Ring a bell ? Tell us . Speak . Doctor . About the patient ... He 's all right . Keep watching him . Oh , you ? Don 't startle me . I 'll retire after this case . You sure ? Got any clues ? Not yet . I envy him . He 's with a woman . I 'm with you . Sorry for that . Damn thing ! Can you eat ? Somehow , yes . Silly . Some food sickens me now , though . No fever . Does coffee sicken you , too ? No . Good . I 'll make you some . Doctor . Don 't " Doctor " me . Were you married ? Got a divorce ? Oh ? You knew ? I married . Yes , I married once . But I 'm a divorcee now . We bought land . And built a custom house . Everyone envied us . But our marriage ended in two months . I got the house as heart balm . It 's vacant now . I don 't feel like living there . There 's a huge electric tower near it . I 'm awkward . I don 't know how to love a man . I wish we were drinking wine together . Pop , be quiet . It 's tasty . I 'm glad . Have some coffee . Don 't bother . Listen to this ! I 'm not the right person . I can 't give you a house . I didn 't want the house . I 'd rather have something else . Like what ? Mutual understanding with a man . That 's it . Don 't decide now . I can 't trust your answer yet . Sorry . It 's all right . I 'm sorry . It aches . Freeze ! Hot ! You all but fooled me . Hey ! You tried to act dumb , eh ? Help ! Help ! Stop it ! Hey , stop pretending ! Stop it ! What ? What 's this ? Help me . Please ! Got it , eh ? What ? Headache medicine . Over there ! Where is it ? I got it . So it 's you after all ! Not this . It 's an antibiotic . For headaches . What 's wrong with headaches ? I hardly slept last night . Yet I wanted to see you . Dammit ! The door was open . What is it ? Not that woman . She 's dangerous . I know . It 's over . You 're the right woman ? An ex-con ... for an ex-crime buff ? What brings you ? You still like me ? Let 's forget this . Don 't say that . I 'm not marrying you . At least I know I 'm not what you want . I wanted to stay with you . I wanted to watch you . I didn 't mean to come . Why did you ? I was worried . You 're a kind person . You don 't know it , though . Your bag . Any medicine ? For what ? Headaches . Kimura ! Manabu ? I have more gifts for you . This way . Here . They were knocked to death and torn apart . It 's ghastly . Look . " For Manabu " Ouch ! Hello ? It 's me . What do you want ? I 'm busy . That woman did it . Enough ! The medicine . Medicine ? In the coffee bag . What ? Lots of it . Hello ? Listening ? Be careful . She 'll come again . Watch for her . I mean it . Believe me . That 's what I wanted to say . I won 't come again . I won 't see you again . Goodbye ! Wait ! What ? Got the medicine ? How many bodies came here ? Is it fun to slice bodies ? Dr. Akagi . Why the fish ? Sometimes I feel like watching living things . Nonsense ! Only humans think death is the end . You controlled yourself last evening . Now I can 't control myself . What a pity ! You could 've slept with Manabu . You told him about headaches . It 's your ulcers . They 're developing too fast . I can 't stay in a body long . The body 's counterattacking you . It 's a sign to abandon this body . We were deceived ! You a human ? How can a human move into brains ? Flesh is no good . It soon disappears . Get out of here and you 'll see what I mean . I 'll kill you and that stupid inspector . After that , I 'll get into Manabu . Dr. Akagi ! Pop ! Hey , Pop ! Wake up , Pop ! Pop ! What 's going on ? Where 's " Something " ? You can 't fool us . What 's this all about ? What happened ? You 're joking , eh ? Don 't act dumb ! Hey ! What 's up ? Keep away ! Help ! Please ! Explain ! He did it ! Knock it off ! Stay put ! Throw off your disguise ! Do it ! Quick ! Manabu ... Stop it ! You all right ? Damn you ! Inspector ! Hayase ! This is enough ! What 's all this ? Are you really our cops ? Say you are clearly ! Enough ! Asako 's odd ! It 's her ! Just come ! Forgive us . What ? We were mistaken . We have no words to apologize . Enough ! Cut it out ! I 'm sorry . Stop it ! They can 't shoot us . Forgive me . Don 't repeat it ! Dammit ! Ouch ! Does she sell health food ? What 's that ? My gift . A method to approach her . Looks cheap . It 's a fake . Give her up . She doesn 't suit you . It 's like you . What a way to console me ! She knew I didn 't love her . Yet she did as I said and ended up like that . You sympathize with her ? Are you so sentimental ? What ? The female doctor and old Akagi ... they all died . " Something " is ... going at me now . I don 't want to see any more bodies ! Me either . So we have no choice but to kill Asako . I know that much ! Hello ? Manabu ? Asako ? Help . That one 's in my head . My head aches . Where are you ? My head aches . Help ! Asako . Where are you ? Understood . She told me . Let 's go . We 're the only ones who can do this . Okay ? I know . Good . Damn you ! I 'll do it alone . Dammit ! Asako ! Asako ! Manabu . You okay ? I 'll die . Well ? It 's not sure yet . I was right , eh ? About what ? You 're kind . Can 't get it . Who 's there ? Will you promise ? Promise what ? That you won 't get mad . Just come in ! No , I won 't . Wait . I promise . Come in . Who 're you ? I 'm not fishy . Maybe a little fish . Turn it off ! Sorry . You ! You promised not to get mad . All right . Get me the key . Really I mustn 't talk to you . Why not ? We mustn 't participate . You an eavesdropper ? A crime buff ? I 'm a fan . I mean I 'm your and Hayase 's fan . Knock it off . Just get me the key . Will you do me a favor first ? What favor ? Tell me . What ? Your autograph . What ? What do you like about me ? Your being a great cop . " Great " ? Old-fashioned , stubborn , honest , straight and ... Shut up ! Thank you . Listen . I wanted a steady job . I chose a health food company . I checked a name list at the office . I found your name . I mean it . Then I couldn 't control myself . I thought it my fate . I 'm sorry . I wanted to tell you that . " Save Asako 's life in return . " " I 'll do as you say . " " I 'll kill . So save Asako 's life ! " No ! It 's writhing in me . It 's weak . It can 't get out of me . Asako . Manabu . Burn me . Burn my body . Silly . Then it 'll be gone . It 'll die , too . How can I do that ? It 's the only way ... to kill it . If I die , it 'll get out of me and do bad things . So burn me . Manabu . Hug me tight . Please . Seems we lost sight of it . Stop the car . Stop ! There 's a huge electric tower near it . Thanks . I 'll borrow it . Hey ! Inspector ! Where are you going ? Hey ! I 'll become a cop , too ! A cop like you . Absolutely ! Dammit ! Asako ... Stop it ! She 's holding me . What on earth are you ? What are you ? A human . A human like you . Cut it out ! I returned from the world to come . Returned ? I fell from the future . This place is filled with cruel egos . But it 's Heaven for you and me . Another Heaven . Isn 't it so ? Is this world Heaven ? The true Heaven 's boring . No fights . No killing . No bad thoughts . Who wants to go there ? You can tell it . Everyone will want to return here . Like I did . I 'm in everyone on earth . In you too . And you know it best . Then get in me . Live in me ! Get out of Asako ! Kill this woman . So I can get in you and stay here . Save Asako . Anything here ? Why the bear ? This will help . Manabu ! Asako ... How is she ? Manabu ... Run ! Quick ! That one is ... water . Water ? Yes . Through ears ... Asako ! Hey ! Water ? What water ? No ... I 'll be the last . I 'll die with it . No . That won 't help . Not you . What 're you doing ? Stop it ! Get up ! Get up ! There ! Step aside ! The water 's gone . Manabu ! Run ! What 's keeping you ? Inspector ! Run ! I 'm all right . Asako ! Wake up ! Wake up , Asako ! Please ! Asako ! I 'm glad . I 'm saved ? Yes . I 'm happy . Because ... Manabu ... you got to liking me . Asako ! Wake up ! Thank you for taking me to the museum . It 's enough . You and I are together now . I 'm happy . I 'm very happy . Asako ! That girl ... she 's somebody . I was wrong . Water ? Were we fighting mere water ? It 's malice . It 's the malice in humans . That 's it . Malice is scattering in the streets . But nothing changes . It 's mixed up . Everyone has both : Love and malice . But ... many aren 't affected by evil . Asako wasn 't .

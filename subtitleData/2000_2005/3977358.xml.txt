 What are you up to ? Crichton ? Yep ? What are you doing ? Playing a game . Doesn 't seem like much of a challenge . Depends on how you play . You were mumbling , again . I was thinking . About what ? ... to remember me by , Crichton . ( screaming ) Nothing . ( sighing ) Crichton , you 've told me yourself that your species isn 't accustomed to being in space for long periods of time . Now , I have seen cases of transit madness before and if you 're cracking up ... Aeryn ... - l want to know . I 'm fine . I don 't want to talk about it . ( sighing ) The human doesn 't want to talk . Rygel : What do mean , they aren 't back yet ? Zhaan : D 'Argo and Chiana are busy , Rygel . What ? They ran out of places to defile up here , so they had to do it in a Transport Pod . Unfortunately for them , nothing so enjoyable . They 've learnt that organic goods from this region are often contaminated by parasites . So they 're looking for a local cure in case there 's an infestation on Moya . Parasites ? What kind ? I don 't have any details yet but I suppose that 's the price you pay for trading in such a prosperous system . Ha ! Prosperous ? is that what you call three planets filled with nothing but miserable , mud grubbing farmers ? Our parasite problems are solved . Rygel 's decided to leave us then , has he ? Not likely . We don 't know if we even have a parasite problem . Well , that 's what this little guy will tell us . ( laughing ) Aeryn : What is that ? It 's a Vorc . Cute , huh ? D 'Argo : We had some problems with our translator microbes and the local merchants , but from what we can gather , this little fellow homes in on one specific parasite and eradicates it . Oh , look . He 's smelling something . A vendor told us about this ship that was infested . The parasites killed everyone on board , over 200 people . and all they left behind were these ... these cocoons or ... Cocoons . - eggs or something . If the parasites are that dangerous we should jettison the food and solve the problem before it starts . When you see what this little fellow can do ... Aw ... ( squealing ) Come back here ! Yep , that 's impressive . Goodness , let the pig dog eat ! He 's a Cinderella boy . Oh my , Bob , this is a ... this is a big chance for the kid from the Uncharted Territories . He 's about two feet off the green here on the 18th , three strokes off the lead . The question is , will he chip , or will he use the putter ? ( soft growl ) Sparky ? Yo Ryg , that you ? Rygel ? ( roaring ) Whoa ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Crichton : I 'm telling you , whatever it was it was going through the food . Have you considered the possibility that you just saw Rygel ? He 's been hoarding food ! - lt wasn 't Rygel . Maybe it was one of those parasites . We never get did get a good description of them . You said you fired at it while it was in this compartment , right ? - Yeah . There 's no other way out of there . Where did it go ? I don 't know . Rygel : Get away from there . That food belongs to me . That food is for all of us . Oh ! What is that foul odor ? It 's Vorc urine . Would you like a whiff ? ( muffled scream ) What 's a Vorc ? It is a predator that kills parasites ! Chiana 's with it. lt 's hunting right now . Whatever it is , it 'd better stay away from my food . Crichton : Hey , maybe that 's what I saw . A Vorc . It was about , naked , with a face like this . No , no. lt was more like tandoori chicken . Pilot , can you spare the DRDs for a search ? Of course , Commander . ( heavy breathing ) ( footsteps scurrying ) ( sighs ) ( sighs ) ( rustling ) ( footsteps thudding ) ( heavy breathing ) ( horrified gasp ) Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Did you get the cage ? Uh , yeah . But I don 't think the Vorc likes it very much . Well , what does he like ? Well , so far , everything , but parasites . Come on , little ... what 's his name ? Well I couldn 't just name him , Zhaan . He 's a free spirit . I mean , you can appreciate that . While I believe it 's wrong to imprison any living creature , ( sniffing ) there are always exceptions . Now ! This thing should be out hunting . You can play with it later . Did it look like I was playing ? Yes . This thing needs to earn its keep . ( shrieking ) Ow ! It frelling bit me . That little ... ( shrieking ) Crichton : All right then , what about the access shafts ? Pilot : The DRDs are searching those areas , but so far there 's no evidence of any creature like the one you 've described . I 'm beginning to doubt whether we 'll find anything at all . Why ? Officer Sun mentioned that you 've been distracted lately . She 's believes it 's possible that you broke into Rygel 's food cache and fired at an imaginary enemy while playing some sort of ... game . It 's golf . Would you believe it 's possible that Aeryn doesn 't know what the hell it is she 's talking about ? I have never known her to exaggerate . Have you , Crichton ? Crichton ? ( soft rattling ) ( rattling ) ( clattering ) ( rattling ) Yotz ! Rygel ! What the hell are you doing ? It 's a cargo bay . I was checking my cargo . I was told we had parasites on board . Now , would you care to explain why you were trying to kill me ? Look , I thought you were that thing that I saw earlier . Sorry . Yoo-hoo ! Little Vorc thingy . Little Vorc ? D 'Argo , the Vorc got away from me . Again ? You have to stay with it . Oh , easy for you to say . It hasn 't stopped running around the ship since it got here . That 's how it hunts . Well yeah , I know , but I 'm starting to get a little tired of following it around . Listen , if we do have a parasite on board , we need to know what it looks like , which means ... Follow the Vorc . Fine . You follow it . ( mimics Chiana ) : " Fine . You follow the Vorc . " ( squishing ) ( groans ) ( whimpering ) Get ... off ... my bed . ( shrieking ) Chiana ? Chiana ! ( snorting ) Get off my bed . D 'Argo ! Yes . That filthy little creature of yours is down in my quarters and it 's using them as a toilet . Among other things . It has to learn the environment before it can find the parasites . The only parasite we have is right here , and if you don 't come and get it , I 'm going to flush it out an airlock . You 're as bad as Chiana . Just leave it alone and let it do its job . ( shrieking ) D 'Argo , I think it 's picked up a scent or something . Don 't let it out of your sight ! ( rattling ) Rygel ? Aeryn , where are you ? Tier Seven junction. I 've lost the Vorc . Dren ! Where was it heading ? What does it matter ? This is pointless . Do you know how dangerous these parasites are ? They suck the life out of their prey and leave nothing but a desiccated husk . These parasites are a fantasy . They 're stories to frighten you and Chiana into purchasing a useless animal . Fine , fine , fine. I will find it myself . Good . Yes . Waste your own time . Where was it heading ? Towards the Maintenance Bay . Chiana : D 'Argo ! D 'Argo ! D 'Argo : Not now , Chiana. I 'm looking for the Vorc . I 'm in the Maintenance Bay and , uh ... ( roaring ) there 's a ... there 's some kind of creature right in front of me . Chiana ! Hurry ! - Get out of there , now ! Yeah , I would if I could . Crichton ! Aeryn ! Maintenance Bay . Now ! Chiana , do something . You do something . ( roaring ) Hey . Okay , easy . We 're ... we 're not going to hurt you , okay ? So ... so ... Now slug him ! We 're on the way ! Don 't panic ! I think it 's a little too late for that . Chiana ! D 'Argo ! - Chiana ! ( yelling ) Huh ? ( labored breathing ) Oh come on , Luxan . Come on . You must not die . Chiana . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . D 'Argo . Rygel , what the hell are you doing ? He wasn 't breathing . And I 'm fine too , thanks for asking . D 'Argo . The creature you saw . The parasite . It 's real . Yeah , I know that . Rygel : I 'm delighted you 've been vindicated , Crichton , but I 'll be even happier when you kill the frellingthing . ( gasping ) Whoa , whoa , whoa , D 'Argo . - D 'Argo ! D 'Argo , what 's wrong ? Hold him down ! Hold him ! - What 's happening ? I don 't know ! Hold him down ! - What 's wrong ? Crichton : Get Zhaan . Zhaan , get down here ! D 'Argo ! Aeryn : Zhaan ! I don 't understand what 's wrong with him . You cleansed the wound . You said there were no internal injuries . I 've done all I can do for now , Chiana . But he appears to have some kind of secondary infection . Like what ? Like that 's what I 'm trying to determine . Well , try faster . I don 't need to be a healer to see that D 'Argo 's getting worse . But you do need to be a healer to make him better . Now , shut up and let me get back to work , or leave . Crichton ? D 'Argo 's not so good . You found the creature ? No sign of it yet . It 's like it just disappeared . Hey , Aeryn ! ( rustling ) ( squeaking ) ( chewing ) We just found your Vorc , Chiana . But that thing 's useless . Aeryn : Maybe not. lt was heading for the Maintenance Bay when you were attacked . I think it knew what was there . Yeah , but isn 't the Vorc supposed to kill the parasite , not just point it out ? And you think this minuscule creature could kill something that could incapacitate D 'Argo ? No . But we could use it to flush the parasite out . It could be our bird dog . ( growling ) Whoa ! That could be your ... uh , you bring it . I 'll just , uh ... I hate critters ! ( labored breathing ) You want to tell me something ? ( whispering ) D 'Argo ... You 're in no condition for sex . Yeah. lt might kill me , huh ? ( laughs , then coughs ) By Khaalen ! What 's wrong ? D 'Argo 's been poisoned . There 's an alien toxin in his bloodstream and it 's killing him . You can make an antidote , can 't you ? I don 't know. I can ... I can try . Crichton : Next . Next . Show me another one . I 'll need a venom sample from the creature , John . But most natural venoms decompose rapidly when the creature dies . We can 't afford to take that risk . So , it 's very important that you capture the creature alive , and quickly . Crichton : We 're working as fast as we can , Zhaan . Pilot , is it possible that this critter has camouflage ability ? Have you tried switching the DRDs to heat and acoustic mode ? Pilot : Yes , and without success . The creature seems quite adept at avoiding surveillance . Show me Cargo Bay 3 . You 'll never see it coming , John . Yes . ( gasping ) What 's going on ? Get me out of here . Pilot has modified the energy fields of Moya 's neural clusters . So , your cells will be fortified . They 'll give you strength . ( gasping ) Why ... why is it so hard to breathe ? The parasite 's venom appears to be designed to paralyze the nerves and muscles of its prey . Your hearts and lungs have been affected , D 'Argo . You 're early , Rygel . I 'm not dead yet . But when I do die , Chiana 's going to get all of my possessions . You always expect the worst of me . is it unthinkable that I might be here simply to offer the gift of my ... company to a shipmate in need ? Yes . ( grunts ) Are you afraid to be alone , Rygel ? I knew you 'd be here . That didn 't frighten me . Why should blessed solitude ? Right . Now . How about this way ? ( squeaking ) This way ? Aeryn , any luck with the Vorc yet ? Oh , yes . So far , he 's led me to the cockpit of your module , a pool of amnexis fluid and a pile of food cube crumbs . How 's D 'Argo ? Poison 's working on him . Zhaan says it 's slow but steady . No ! No biting . Listen , we 'll find the parasite and I 'll shoot it . Aeryn ! No shooting ! That 's what the sleep gas is for . I know that . Whoa ! - You got something ? Well , apparently , the Vorc thinks it does . It 's getting very hard to control . Listen to me. I 'm going to let you out . So , not too far , and not too fast . is that clear ? ( chattering wildly ) Clear ? ( loud crash ) What was that ? The DRDs have located the creature . Pilot ! It 's in the airlock above you , Zhaan . The creature. lt 's coming for us . I 'm trying to seal off the tier to keep it confined . Pilot ! Crichton ! Anybody ? It 's moved out of the air shaft . Tier Four . I 've lost contact with a DRD . ( gasps ) Ahh ! No ! Frell ! Where did it go ? Damn it , Chiana ! I don 't trust Aeryn to wing that thing and she 's a good shot . We have to get it into a confined space where the gas grenade can do some good . What 'd you expect me to use ? Harsh language ? That was a warning shot . Yeah , well ten is more than a warning . Pilot , we lost it . I know what I 'm doing , okay ? I didn 't ask you to come along and I don 't ... Shh ! Chiana , go back to D 'Argo and give him a reason to live . And do what ? What , sit by him and watch him die ? This is the only way I know how to help him . The creature is on Tier Three , hamman side and moving rapidly . It 's heading for Command ! Pilot ! Seal off the exits ! Done . The creature has no way out . Do it ? Armed . Ready . Pilot , open sesame . It couldn 't have gotten out . Could it ? Shut up and keep searching . ( growling ) Crichton : Not now . Crichton . What 's the matter ? - Nothing. I 'm fine . He 's got to be around here somewhere . Chiana . Chiana : Ah , frell . The Vorc . He must have chased the creature in here . So where is it ? ( squeaking ) Why don 't you show us . Come on . Show us the parasite . ( growling ) ( roaring ) Grenades . ( hissing ) That thing was the Vorc all along ? Wait a minute . Are you saying the Vorc is the parasite ? The only thing I know for certain is that you brought it on board . How was I supposed to know ? Crichton : Girls , quit the sniping . Zhaan needs a venom sample . All right , what do you mean , there 's no venom ? I can 't find any . There 's no trace of any toxin whatsoever in any of the samples I took from that creature . You must have missed something then . I checked down to its hair follicles . I tried every technique I know . I 'm sure that didn 't take long . Shut up , Rygel . There has to be another explanation . Well perhaps it 's only poisonous in its other form . It attacked D 'Argo in its present form . Aeryn : Besides , it bit me when it was small , and I 'm fine . Then the poison had to come from somewhere . Pilot , how long would it take us to get back to where we bought this damn thing ? At maximum speed Moya could reach the planet in less than 32 arns . D 'Argo won 't make it . His respiration is failing . The field in the neural cluster won 't sustain him much longer . The thing that attacked me was the Vorc . Zhaan 's getting a venom sample from it now . You 're gonna be fine . Don 't lie to me . I brought the frellingthing on board . This is all my fault , D 'Argo . You didn 't bring him here . We both did . Crichton : All right , riddle me this . Because we think we may have parasites on board , we get a Vorc , 'cause someone tells us that Vorcs kill parasites . And all of a sudden , this other critter shows up , this Ewok gone bad . Bites D 'Argo , poisons him , yeah ? So we capture the parasite , and surprise , the parasite and the Vorc are the same thing , but neither one of them is poisonous . So , for $ 10,000 and the Caribbean cruise , what poisoned D 'Argo ? Something else must have . Yes . You 're suggesting there 's another creature on board . Yes , the real parasite . What if the Vorc is working as advertised ? It 's hunting the parasite , but it 's doing it in two different forms ? Smaller , faster form for tracking , a larger , more powerful form for attack . Exactly . Why did it attack Chiana and D 'Argo ? I don 't know . Maybe they scared it , threatened it somehow . You know , D 'Argo has that effect on everything . Aeryn : Even if this real parasite exists , which I 'm still not convinced it does , we have no idea what it is . is it an insect , a microorganism , another creature like this ? I don 't know . Why don 't you ask it ? Oh , that 's very good , Crichton . I know my translator microbes are working , because deranged as it always is , I do understand what you 're saying . But this creature can only grunt and growl. lt cannot talk . No , Aeryn , this is a good idea . Why don 't we see if we can get the incredible Vorc here to understand us ? D 'Argo is dying . You got a better idea , lay it on me . ( creature growling ) ( whimpering ) All right , Pilot , shoot him up . lnjecting translator microbes . ( screams ) Hey , over here . Listen up . You understand me ? We just want to talk to you . This is a waste of time , Crichton . Translator microbes don 't take this long to work . Let 's take it to Zhaan . She can dissect it , see if she missed something . Dissect it ? Yeah , I say we kill it . ( yelling ) Aeryn , it understands what you 're saying . Take it back . Take it back . Hello . I 'm sorry . I don 't want to kill you . That was terrible . That was ... that was ... look , Lassie here is trying to communicate with us . Yeah , and I don 't understand you . Pilot : Officer Sun ... I believe it 's asking why . Pilot , you understand him ? Somewhat . Because of my bond with Moya I am , accustomed to nonverbal communication . While I don 't believe this creature has language in a true sense , it seems to be expressing itself in a mixture of simple concepts , sensations and instinctual reactions . Keep translating . " Why ... pain ... me ? " Well , we hurt you because you hurt us . Why did you attack D 'Argo ? Our friend ? Friend . " Attack ... " " Defend . " D 'Argo attacked you first ? " Friend . " " Friend . " It keeps repeating " friend . " In the Command. lt showed us it could change shapes . It wasn 't trying to hurt us . No . What do you want ? ( chattering ) " Bad ... danger ... here . " There 's a parasite on board ? Are you the parasite ? The answer to that is " no . " Who 's going to say yes to that ? That is no . - Clarifying . Can you help us find the parasite ? " Hunt ... the bad . " " Kill the bad . " " Free . " " Kill the bad . " Right . So you want us to free you , so you can kill the parasite . That 's a better question . Clarification . And that 's a " yes . " Do you trust it ? I don 't know . We could have it describe the parasite to us and we could find it ourselves . Who knows how long that could take ? D 'Argo doesn 't have that much time to spare . You 're right . Hey , little fella . We 're going to roll the dice . ( sniffing ) But you make one wrong move , I will shoot you . You understand shoot ? Ka-tow , ka-tow , ka-tow . Little bolts of light . Ouch . ( sniffing ) Here we go again . Pilot , can you dial down Moya 's atmospheric scrubbers ? It might enhance whatever this little guy 's sniffing . Reducing scrubbers now . Crichton , have you taken leave of your senses ? I don 't expect much from Aeryn , but you ... Relax , Sparky . We 're on it . I saw what it did to D 'Argo . If it comes near me , I 'll kill it , I swear . Lock yourself in your room and do whatever the hell it is you do in there by yourself . Crichton ... ( roaring ) Hey , hey ! We had a deal ! You were supposed to lead us to it . Pilot , I demand that you fuel a Transport Pod and make it ready for departure this microt . Rygel , I told you , my DRDs are occupied . I cannot help you now . ( roaring ) ( gasps ) Help ! Anybody , help ! Rygel ? Rygel ? Are you there ? Rygel ? ! It 's not after you , Rygel . It 's after the parasite . Just keep moving ! Get out of the area . It 's closing in . I can hear it . Crichton , you said I 'd be safe . You said ... Rygel , don 't move . ( muffled growl ) Rygel is your friend . Rygel , tell him you 're his friend . Yotz . Kill it . - No . Friend . Kill it . Rygel , it 's probably not after you . It 's just looking for a gopher lead . Huh ? Now slow . Rygel : Kill it ! Kill it ! Kill it ! ( growling ) No , get off him ! - No , Rygel , get off him ! No ! ( gasping ) Help me . ( gasping in pain ) Can 't move . So cold . Body ... feels ... broken . Rygel , you 're going into shock . Zhaan says you have internal injuries . Your fault . You let that thing do this to me . Sparky ... Sparky , just ... shut up . Try and stay calm . He 's been poisoned . Crichton : What ? Zhaan : There were massive traces of toxins in Rygel 's wound , the same compounds I found in D 'Argo . Crichton : Zhaan , we had the Vorc in our hands . You said it wasn 't poisonous . I made a mistake . If I bring it in dead , is there any possibility that you can make an anti-venom ? Zhaan : Well , it 's possible . There 's nothing I can do for Rygel and D 'Argo without it . Well , one way or the other . You 're getting it , okay ? Yeah . Can he talk ? I don 't know . How you doing ? ( gasping weakly ) Find my son . Find my son . We 'll find him together . You take care of him . Blood. I knew we hit it . Yeah , hide from me now , friend . When we see him , he 's mine . We 'll see . Aah ! What the frell was that for ? It was nothin ' . Just clearing my head . ( roaring ) Crichton ! Do you see any blood ? No . - All right ... That way . - That way . Aeryn ! No , no , no . We are not splitting up . We 're running out of time . We don 't have another choice . Whoa ! Whoa , whoa ! That thing just gave us the slip . Why would it come back for us unless it was leading us into a trap . What else ? Right . As long as we both know . ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling soft ) Better get it back to Zhaan . Crichton : Aeryn ... what is that ? Can you say ... " cocoon " ? Zhaan : Chiana said the parasites leave cocoons behind . Aeryn , it led us here to see this . ( growling ) Crichton : Holy body snatchers . Start talking . ( growling softly ) That frellingthing went through my mouth . Could barely frelling breathe . Strands pouring out of me . Through my ears , nose , my pores , every frelling hole in my body . Form ... formed this cocoon around me to feed to its frelling offspring . Imagine me , food for something else ! It took my shape , and then it ... How do I know you 're Rygel ? ( farting sound ) ( in a high-pitched voice ) Where are you going ? ( whimpering ) Zhaan , get out of there now ! Crichton : It 's not Rygel ! It 's the parasite ! ( growling ) ( vicious yell ) ( screaming ) No , Rygel ! ( both yelling ) Help ! Ryg ? ( yells ) ( high-pitched chattering ) Cover me ! ( sizzling ) ( crunching ) What the frell is that ? Both : Sorry about the mess . That parasite was hiding in a crate of marjools I was inspecting in the cargo bay . ( shudders ) A hideous experience . It was actually feeding off my essence , my thoughts . And it would have done the same to all of you . I remember Rygel ... uh , the other one ... standing over me after I was wounded . That parasite was going to use you next . Why didn 't it ? I suspect it tried but D 'Argo 's reaction to the venom was so strong , it didn 't have enough time to complete its task . How could you of all been so stupid to let that thing fool you ? It was a perfect copy of you , Rygel . Ha ! Perfect ? Perhaps to undiscerning observers like yourselves . Fortunately , that courageous Vorc was here to rescue me . Pilot ? He ... says he 's happy . is there anything we can do to help ? Pilot : I don 't think the creature understands the concept . ( weak , high-pitched sounds ) " End ... " " End ... " He knows his time is near . I am so ... so sorry . ( weak , high-pitched sounds ) ( gasps softly ) Crichton when we were hunting , you , uh ... almost blew my head off . That was a bad shot , even for you . Yeah . What 's your point ? What were you firing at , really ? I 've been ah , having these ... well , I wouldn 't exactly call them hallucinations . I 've been having these ... flashes of Scorpius . Flashes ? Like memories ? No , they 're not memories . It 's more like he 's talking to me . You ever been in a crowded room , and everybody 's talking all at the same time so you can 't hear anybody . And suddenly , someone says your name and then ... ( snaps ) like crystal , you hear every word they say . No matter how far away they are it 's like they 're talking only to you . What is Scorpius saying to you ? He says he 's gonna get me . Says he already has , I just don 't know it yet . Why didn 't you kill him when you had the chance ? I tried . I tried . But I couldn 't . Something stopped me . Something inside . Crichton , if you need help ... I 'll ask . Just like you do . Aeryn , don 't worry . ( laughing ) I 'm not gonna lose my mind . It 's all I 've got left . All right . Scorpius ( whispering ) : You 'll never see it coming , John . When the trap closes , it will be too late . You think ? Checkmate . You lose . That , um ... wasn 't the trap that I meant . Hmm ...

 A grand touring automobile . That 's what Challenger should invent next . Leather seats , landau top , and a big luggage compartment to hold all his bloody equipment . The automobile 's already been invented , Marguerite . Not on this plateau it hasn 't . Well , then it 's a good thing he 's building something even better . Ready for the next one . Hey , Ned , toss me back the next one ... and we 'll see how many we can keep in the air at once . Well , Veronica , if we miss the morning ... thermals , we 'll have to cancel the test flight . I remember when you used to have a sense of humor . Well , this balloon , once it 's fully tested , is going to take us all home . I am home ! Well , you know what I mean . We 'll all go to London . - We 'll get a chance to . - I 'm not going , Ned . I 'm not leaving the plateau until I find my parents . But I thought ... I 've been thinking , too . You 'd better finish this on your own . So , Challenger , this new hydrogen-evolver of yours , it 's not going to explode like the one in your lab . I have made changes since then , Marguerite . The whole system is now completely sealed . Oh , we have neutral buoyancy . Malone ... get the last of the iron filings . The sulfuric acid is now safely contained in glass ... containers in those barrels . It 's drawn by vacuum pressure up ... through these pipes and down into the reaction crucible here where ... it mixes with the iron filings that I 've poured in here . The acid-iron reaction then evolves hydrogen gas ... which travels up through this tube and into the balloon . It 's much more efficient than heating air . You know , sometimes , George , I can 't decide what it is you like more : building the contraptions or talking about them . Talking about them ! Well there ends the lesson for today . Now , does anybody want to go sightseeing ? - Madam - Thank you , George . - Thank you . - Ma 'am . - Are you ready ? - Okay . Let it go ! Here we go ! Ha , ha ! I 'd forgotten the beauty of this place . Apart from those awful clouds . They might as well be prison walls . Oh , in a few months , when the seasonal winds change , I believe we 'll have a good chance of getting passed those clouds , As long as we can get enough altitude . Well , that 's what we 're here for . Okay , Challenger , open her up . Let 's see what she 's got . Oh than It 's a bit more energy than I thought . OH ! I think we are high enough Challenger . - I know we are high enough . - This is most unexpected . We seem to be caught in a powerful high altitude wind . How is doing the test George ? Well , we should be descending . We are descending ... into that ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World We 're turning out of control ... Make it ascend , Challenger . Make it up . We are going to hit the ground . We 've already passed ground level . This doesn 't look like the plateau . Yeah , I tend to agree . The wind 's blown us off . I wouldn 't break out the champagne just yet . Where on earth are we ? We 're not ON earth , we 're IN it . We are in some vast underground cavern , far deeper than we ever went with the Kobolds . Not to be a spoilsport , George , but how can that be remotely possible ? As my grandfather 's old friend , Otto Leidenbrock once said , We know less about the earth we live on ... than we do about the stars in outer space . The greatest mysteries of all , he said , are right beneath our feet . So much for your theory , George , If that 's a pterodactyl , then we 're still on the earth , not under it . That 's not a species I recognize . Behind you Malone ! It 's circling back ! Whoa , be careful Malone . It 's gone for the gas bag . Well , that 's torn it ! Prepare yourself for a violent explosion ! I thought you said the evolver wouldn 't explode ! Well , the evolver won 't explode , But the hydrogen gas mixing violently with air will . Veronica ? Veronica ! Veronica ! We landed . In a matter of speaking . You just stay away from that acid smell . Where are we ? - Terra incognita . - The land unknown . Nothing is out there , everything is out there . As much as I 'd like to enjoy the scenery , We 've got a lot to do . We 've got to drain this acid first . - Are you ready ? - One , two , three . One more time put your mass into it . 1 , 2 , 3 . Oh , Boy . The air is so thin , George , Reminds me of the Himalayas . The concentration of oxygen is much less than we 're use to . Most likely because of the amount needed to produce all this ... electro-luminescent light . How much less oxygen ? Enough to prevent the hydrogen gas ... from exploding when the balloon was torn . I 'll stop my complaining . One more time ! - Are you ready ? - Hm mm . Oh ! Looks like we 've lost all our iron filings . And half our supply of sulfuric acid . Without iron , you can 't make hydrogen gas to fill the balloon . And without the balloon we can 't make it back to the surface . Just what I 've always wanted . A place that annoys me more than the plateau . George , we 've got company . She looks human ! Very human . Hello ! My name is George Challenger . I am Aleece . You 're from the land above the sky . Yes , we are , we are from the surface . You killed the sky demon . May I ? Pterodactyl talon . Recently removed . About the 3 years old from the sights of it , About the same age as the one you shot , Ned . You killed it from your balloon . That 's right . Good . I will ride in your balloon . And you will show me my land from a great height . I 'm afraid that may not be possible , as you can see , our balloon is not exactly flight worthy at the moment . What will make it possible ? Iron , maybe . Iron ! That means nothing to me . May I examine your sword ? Looks promising . Your sword is made of iron . Then iron is the stone of Arjax . Tell me how much you require . Oh , enough to make twenty swords , at least . I will get you the iron you need . Then you will take me on your balloon . Does anybody but me think this is too good to be true ? Iron is iron , Marguerite . And we need it to get home . Your kind offer is grateful accepted . Fine . So Little Miss Helpful will help us find some iron ! That 's not going to fix the balloon . Speaking of Little Miss Helpful and the ripped balloon . I 've just the job for you and Veronica . Trust the men to fall for a pretty face . That woman had better not be lying about knowing where to find iron . Well , Aleece is their problem . Finding sap to make into glue for the balloon repair is ours . We have to find some plants first . I 'm beginning to think that nothing actually grows down here . There has to be a food chain , Marguerite . Where there are pterodactyls and people , there 's got to be plants . I suppose so . Nature is nature . That never changes . Right . Only people do . As in you and Malone ? I don 't think he 's changed all that much . The poor boy has been in love with you ... since the day you two first met . But I 'm not in love with him , Marguerite . Are you sure ? Well , if I was in love with him , then , wouldn 't I follow him anywhere ? Even to London ? True love conquers all . Yeah , I 've heard that before . I once followed a man all the way from Monaco to Shanghai . What happened ? Let 's just say after Shanghai , I 'm never going to do it again . Oh , poor Roxton ! If it 's true love , he can follow me for a change . Oh , I think he would ... well , at least for a little while . I just wish I knew where I was going . Aleece , where do your people live down here ? My village is five intervals of sleep away . Five intervals is five days . What are you doing so far from home ? To earn my place as a warrior . I went on a quest for the talon of a sky demon . Because of you I found it . But won 't your trophy be from another man 's kill ? Isn 't that bending the rules ? The stories of my people teach that many roads can lead to a single destination . How I obtained the talon is not important . Only that I return with it . I would like to hear more about those stories . And I would like to hear more about you , and where you come from . Not much to tell really . Three years ago I joined an expedition . We crossed an ocean and discovered a mysterious land on the surface , above your world . There were five of us then . Professor Challenger , Professor Summerlee , Marguerite , Roxton and me . What about Veronica ? Where did you meet her ? In the jungle . Where she 's lived alone since her parents disappeared . - She means a lot to you . - Well , she took us in . We live in her house in the trees . You live with her , and yet you are not lovers ? Well we 're close friends . Is there someone else ? No , not at the moment anyway . That is good . Good for me , I mean . Why would you say that ? There are many possibilities . Those look like oasis plants , like the ones on the plateau . Let 's just hope they have sap like oasis plants . One more to fill . There , that looks promising . Now , getting back to the subject at hand . Oh , that 's right . You and Roxton . Nice try . What kind of sap is this ? Marguerite , stay back . Veronica ! No ! Typical , you do something nice for someone else ... and no one 's around to see it ! Come on , sleeping beauty . It 's a long way to Tipperary . Good job , Roxton . Now all we need is ... some repair glue . Look at this place , George . Do you honestly think Veronica and Marguerite will have ... any chance of finding plants down here ? Certainly I do . Airborne seeds from the surface would have fallen down ... through the caldera just as we did . The resulting plants would over the centuries mutate into species ... that are better able to survive down here . Evolutionary adaptation , huh ? I suppose that accounts for the albino pterodactyls . Absence of natural lighting it could loss skin pigmentation . Exactly . When conditions change , life must change . You know , George , if things don 't work out ... hypothetically speaking ... do you think we can adapt to this world ? Given the heat , lack of oxygen , and those geothermal cauldrons ... venting a devil 's brew of toxic fumes , I sincerely doubt whether we can survive ... two or three more days , let alone adapt . Challenger ! I 'll take her . Steady ! You should rest now . Is it much colder on the surface ? I never used to think so . You are brave , setting out across my world , trusting my word when I 'm a stranger to you . Nowadays , when I do things like that , my friends think I 'm crazy . Especially Veronica . What do you think ? I think I 've been sitting on the sidelines watching for too long , taking notes when I should have been taking action . You want to be a warrior , just as I do . I 've seen war . Too much of it . I 'd prefer to have adventures no one else has had . That 's why I want to fly in your balloon , to see things no one else has seen since the last ... balloon visited our land . Another balloon came here ? When ? Ten seasons of growth ago . When I was a child . The village elders still tell stories about it . Ten years ago ! Who was on it ? They said they were Laytons . Thomas and Abigail . What happened to them ? Are they still here ? The stories say they lived among us for a short time , but then they left in their balloon . Why are these Laytons of interest to you ? Because Tomas and Abigail Layton ... are Veronica 's parents . Veronica ... again ! Veronica is important to you . - All my friends are . - But she 's more than a friend . Yes . Well , no , not exactly . Good . Then she has no right to challenge this . You are not free yet . My friends ... they 're counting on me , on us . We have to find the iron . What your friends need is just ahead . They were most likely plant spores you encountered . Her pulse is weak , but steady . The plant spores would have been intended to kill animals ... whose decaying bodies would then fertilize the soil . I 've had just about enough of the wonders of nature for one day . Will she recover ? Well , that is the most likely outcome . Challenger ! It 's our only outcome ! Hurry ! The fires are unpredictable here ! - Is this an abandon iron mine ? - Of a sort . From this point on , silence . You must do as I say . Aleece , who are all these people ? Exiles from my village , unworthy to be warriors . If they catch us , they will kill us . Aleece . This is stealing . There 's got to be a better way to get the iron . Not as quickly . Do you want to go home or not ? Many roads to a single destination . Thieves ! Go , Oh . Come on , let 's go , come on . You stop ! Intruder . Stealing from the caves of Arjax is forbidden . The law is clear . All thieves must die . Stop right there ! You have everything and you steal from me ? Aleece . On your feet ! - Kill her ! - No ! Then surrender . No , Malone ! He can 't be trusted ! Chain him up ! He 's innocent , Arjax , The crime is mine . The question is , why would a warrior commit it ? Or is this stolen too ? You failed your quest . You had no right to scorn my victory . In my cave , I have the right to take your life . Are all exiles cowards like you ? Afraid of a fair fight . Arjax ! He has a balloon ! Like the Laytons . Show me ! Show me ! There . The Challenger Hydro-Aerosphere Mark Two . Liar ! It is not the same . I saw it flying , Arjax , it is just like the people say . There ! That 's is the Laytons ' balloon . No , this is a hot air balloon . See these braziers in the old basket they heat the air that fills the bag . This is a new brand type of balloon . It runs on a different kind of air . Hydrogen gas . Challenger makes it by using acid in this tanks ... and a stone of Arjax . Arjax , he needed the stone to go home . You can understand that . You will take me to your balloon , and you will make it fly like the stories tell . Or ... I will make your flesh ... quench my blade . I can live with that . You sure don 't get points for technique , George . On , on the contrary , Roxton , my dear old friend ... Pablo Picasso taught me that if you hold the brush ... in this fashion , you get a ... Hallo , our iron has arrived . Yeah and I don 't think I like who it arrived with . Pig iron , not as efficient , but it 'll do the job . We are greatly indebted to you . My name is Arjax . Your balloon will fly now ? Oh , indeed it will . I will ride in it . Perhaps we should sell tickets , huh ? - We made a bargain . - And we will keep it , we have enough acid , and now thanks to our new friends , we have enough iron . A short trip won 't be an imposition now , will it , Roxton ? We also made a bargain . Our weapons . Thank you , Arjax , this is turning into a real adventure for everyone . Hey , where is Veronica ? She had an unfortunate encounter with the local flora , no long-term harm . She 's under the lean-to . I found her a present . - Layton ? - Veronica 's parents ? It seems her parents not only explored the plateau above , they were down here as well . At least for a short while . Hmm ! But how did one of my parents journals get down here ? Well , apparently they gave it as a gift to somebody in Aleece 's village , before they went back to the surface . But when ? My parents never had a balloon . They never mentioned anything about a hollow earth . Maybe the answers are in there . Thank you , Ned ! With all of my heart . You know there 's nothing I wouldn 't do for you . Yeah , I do know . It 's just that I haven 't always known where we stand . I think we both know that sometimes romance doesn 't last . But friendship can . So we 're okay ? Ned , we 'll always be okay . You 're part of my life . You always will be . Well , I hope you find what you 're looking for in there . So do I. Veronica 's reading the journal . I think she 's going to be all right . Where is Aleece ? She was helping Challenger and Arjax with the basket repairs . Where is she now ? Is there a problem ? No , I 'll just go take a look and see if they are anywhere nearby . Well when you see them tell them Challenger says ... the balloon will be ready to fly in an hour . I 'll only be about five minutes . Is there anything going on between Malone and Aleece ? nothing we need to know about . Want to go on a balloon ride ? Marguerite ! You have to read this ! Look at the date it 's three months after my parents went away . That 's wonderful ! What else does it say ? All sorts of things about where the traveled and what they saw . Look at these two pages back here . Here , here . I can 't read them . They look like Celtic runes , but ... I can 't understand them either . It 's a ... cart drawing and diagrams ... sketches , maps ! and they write how much they love me ... and how they miss me . Oh sweetie ! Hey ! Let 's go home and find your parents ! Huh ? Yeah . Yeah . Aleece . - Why did you run away ? - I 'm looking for Arjax . What haven 't you told me about him ? When Arjax failed in his quest to become a warrior , in his rage he caused the deaths of other on their quests . So when he was exiled , even his name was taken from him ... and he was called after the stone he mines . Why is that important now ? The only way Arjax can reclaim his name ... and be welcomed back as a warrior ... is to do a great deed for the village , give a great gift . You think he 's going to steal our balloon . I know he is . It 's his only hope . We 've got to get back to warn my friends . Too late to run . What is that weapon ? Something I hope your world never knows . Come on ! Warrior ! Go back to where you belong , Arjax . You can 't win . Then neither will you . No ! Get out . Aleece . I 'm a warrior . I swear I 'll make him pay . No , Malone it is your duty to your friends . It 's the only way Arjax cannot win . Cowards ! Follow me ! Kill them all ! Then the balloon is mine ! We have neutral buoyancy . It 's almost ready to fly . Move it ! He 's alone ! Arjax and his men , they are going to try to steal the balloon . Malone , where 's Aleece ? - Arjax ! - We tried to delay them . But this balloon could buy his freedom . We 'll I suggest we use it to ensure our own freedom first . We almost have positive buoyancy . Ready to go whenever you are . Release the ropes at my call . - You ready Malone ? - Ready ! Then let 's go home . - Come on , Malone . - Come on Ned ! - Malone ? - Ned what are you doing ? - It 's tied too tight . - We 'll undo it . - Malone leave it . - Forget it Malone . - Come on . - Malone I said leave it . Malone , spear ! Malone ! - Here they come . - I 'll cover you . Now , Ned . - Come on Ned . - Come on come back here . - I can 't ! - You can 't take them all . Leave it Malone I 'll release the rope from up here . The stake ! - Malone ! - Malone ! - The stake ! - Run Malone ! I 'm going down for him . If we lost weight we only go higher . Then take us down George . I 'm dealing over as fast as I can . - Malone the ladder ! - Quick ! Run for the ladder . Malone ! This is for Aleece . Come on Neddy-boy ! ... run for it ... Grab the ladder , come on ! You can do it ! Come on , Ned ! Get him inside , we are going off . Now what , Challenger ? Straight up the caldera like old St. Nick ? I timed the winds when we were on the ground , there 's a definite cycle to the up and down drafts . - So what I suggest we do - Just please . Get us out of here . Point taken . Well done , Neddy boy . We have to land to check the repairs of the gas bag . Veronica , keep a hold on it the wind can still take it . OH ! Oh ! No ! - Veronica ! - Veronica ! - Veronica ! - Veronica ! - Jump ! - Jump ! - Veronica - Jump ! Malone ! - Veronica - Veronica No ! Malone ! Jump ! Veronica jump ! How long will the hydrogen last ? - Two days at most . - She 's more than a match for him . She has to be . When I throw you off I would fly even higher . I 'm not the one who 's leaving , You don 't know how to fly this thing Arjax Throw your knife now overboard I 'll land us safely . I 'm a warrior now . Theres is nothing you can do ! There 's nothing . Veronica is still on board . She 's heading for those awful clouds ! Can the balloon survive those winds ? It was designed to survive but it 's so damaged . Knowing Veronica , she 'll be the first one to make it off the plateau . And she 's the only one who never wanted to leave . She 'll never make it through the updrafts . The winds will bring her back to the plateau . But where ? And when ? Wherever she lands , we 'll find her . Now she 's just like the rest of us , lost . And looking for a way home . *

 It 's stopped . - What ? - Nothing . How are we doing ? - Ready . - Feeling the magic ? Oh , I 'm feeling the magic ! All right , let 's hit them ! Yeah ! Let 's do it . - Here we go . - Let 's hit them . Let 's go make $ 30 million . Good morning . Before I begin , let me ... - David ? - I 'll go get help . Jesus ! Jesus , David ! Phone 911 ! Nick ? Nicky ? It 's OK , it 's OK . Get everybody else off the bus ! Sound waves . So , if we know that sound waves gain wavelength and lose frequency as they travel through more dense materials , then the anomalies in these waves are the means by which we can surmise the basic architecture of our planet . How are the nails coming , Christine ? Good . All right , let 's have a demonstration . Mr Acker . Veronica . Thank you very much . Mrs Limestone , being a big softie , loves walks , bedtime stories , loves Chet . I can 't play Chet , but I 'll try . Watch the oscilloscope . All right , here we go . - Dr Joshua Keyes ? - Maybe . Yes or no ? - The first one . - Come with us . - Guys , what 's going on ? - We don 't know , sir . What ? Your security clearance is higher than ours . - I have security clearance ? - We 're just bringing you to your jet . My jet ? Serge ! Serge ! Serge . It 's about time . You 're always late . Let 's go . What am I doing here ? They wouldn 't brief me till you got here . There are biochemists everywhere , military . I hate them . - When will you meet a nice girl ? - I 'm married to my work . So am I , so my wife is my mistress . That 's why I 'm still in love with her . - Because you 're always a romantic . - I love my wife . - I love your wife , too . - I know . I know . - You don 't love in the same way . - It 's the French . I think it 's the cheese . The cheese ! You 're teasing , right ? - These are bodies . - I think we 're in the wrong place here . No . If you were , you would 've already been shot . - That 's a hell of a greeting . - Serge . - Serge . - Always a pleasure . - Same here , Thomas . Dr Keyes . - I know . Tom Purcell . Gentlemen , you realise that everything here is totally classified ? OK ? At 10.30 a.m. Local time , 32 civilians , all within a ten-block radius , died . They didn 't get sick first . They hit the ground dead . - Nerve agent ? - No . - They all died at the same time ? - As far as we can tell . - It 's about to hit CNN . I need a reason . - Any variation in sex , age , body type ? They all had pacemakers . Under a minute . Your reputation is well deserved . How did you guess without clues ? We 're the clues . He specialises in high energy weapons . I do geomagnetics . Calling us means you suspect an electromagnetic pulse weapon . If these are the only fatalities , they must be susceptible to electronic interference . QED , pacemakers . You 're spooky sometimes . I need to know . Did some sort of weapon kill them ? The power you would need to create an EM pulse strong enough , - that 's not a weapon I 've ever heard of . - OK , we 're done . No , there 's nothing on the other side of the equals sign . I agree . Our concern was if it was an act of war . As it 's not , we can all breathe easier . Can 't we ? What is it , sweetheart ? It 's OK . These things happen ... Let 's go ! Justin ! Watch it , you bloody idiot ! The skies are empty now . But a few hours ago , it was different . Eyewitnesses said the birds were not attacking people deliberately ... And it 's not just this time . No , no , no . The Fortean Times reported swarms last month in Australia and Japan . ... this bizarre and terrifying incident in Trafalgar Square . Weird . - Strange . - Strange indeed . - How do birds navigate ? - By sight . - No , the long-range stuff . - Magnetic field . Ions in their brains align with the Earth 's magnetic field . - Yeah , what she said . - Right ? Hit the Net , do a search for ... two years ought to do it . Any weird news . Bizarre bird migrations , whale and dolphin beachings unusual atmospheric phenomena . Use your imagination . - That 's a huge search . - You look up Sailor Moon crap . You 're up to this . Danni , get me the brightest kids from the Field Theory class and model an electromagnetic field laid over a 3-D computer model of the Earth . - The planet Earth ? - Yeah , the pretty blue one . Map out the anomalies that Acker finds and do the equations . And grab those smelly kids from your Non-Linear Diff class , too . - Do we have time for this ? - I 'll sign your doctorates blindfolded . - Blindfolded ? - Do not pass " Go " , go directly to PhD . Be wrong . Be wrong . I 'm coming in hard , give me some drag . Roger that . We are in attitude for entry interface . Nice work , Major . I have the controls now for E.I. - I could take us in . - You could . But you won 't . - I 'm ready for this , Bob . - No , you 're not , Beck . You 're trained , and you 're certified , but the Commander lands the bird . You 're the youngest person ever in space . Be happy . Now . Endeavour , Houston . We show you " go " for re-entry . Houston , Endeavour . Descending and coming up on entry interface . Endeavour , this is Flight . Couldn 't annoy the Commander into letting you land ? - Negative . I 'll have to be more annoying . - Is that even possible ? - Endeavour , we see you in good config . - Roger , Houston . - Goodbye , zero G. - I 'm seeing those plasma trails now . - At Mach twenty-four and a half . - So , a minute to air . Skimming through the Earth 's atmosphere in a spaceship . Com dropout ! - Start the I Com ? - Let 's wait until the ... Com restored . Quiet . - We 're out of position . - Guidance shows us on course . I 've simulated this 213 times . We 're not where we should be . Where are we ? Endeavour , guidance is bad . You are now one-two-niner miles off course . - Roger , Houston . We noticed . Is that ... ? - Los Angeles . Confirmed . We are 15,000 feet with maybe two minutes glide time left . - The guidance and beacons are wrong ? - We 're heading for downtown . - We 're not crashing into LA . - They 'll hit LA at 300 knots . Bob , you know LA ? I have an idea . Houston , those buildings are getting big . Can you clear a freeway ? - OK . Thank you . - Come on ! It 's rush hour , Commander . It 's bumper to bumper . - Sir , if you turn to heading 1-7-5 ... - It 's Houston 's call . - Computers are plotting . - Come on . - Houston , time 's critical . - Sir , my alternate ! - What have you got ? - Houston , confirm landing coordinates ? - Endeavour , give them to me . - Touchdown at 30-3-55 north , 1 - 18 - 10 west . Bill ? It 's theoretically possible . That is confirmed . Turn right , heading 1-7-5 . Expect visual contact with LA River in five seconds . That will not work , Houston . We 've got bridges . - Our wingspan will fold us up . - I 've figured the ' L ' over ' D ' max . We 'll make it if you bring us straight in . - 290 feet , 320 . - Arm gear . - Armed . - Gear down . Gear in transition . 240 feet , 290 . Hang on . It won 't be subtle . 210 feet , 265 . Get out of the way ! Move ! De-rotate . - 230 , 210 . - Speed brakes . 100 per cent . - Deploy the chute . - No , we 'd snag the bridge . Banking right ! That next bridge ! We 're too high for that one ! Raise gear . - Not yet . - We hit , it 's over ! And ... gear up now ! Brace , it 's out of my hands . Let 's get out of here ! Get off ! - Dr Zimsky ? - Give my assistant your number , darling . - Sure . - Hello . - It 's all right . Hello . - Thank you . - Dr Zimsky ? - Yes . What 's your name ? No , sir , I don 't need you to sign it . I need you to read that . I don 't have time . I 'm late for the White House . Please . - I need you to confirm my results . - Do you have any idea who I am ? Yes , I do , sir . Please read this . What 's it about ? It 's the end of the world . No , this is impossible . I 'm sorry . I can 't have missed this . You have to be wrong . I 'm sure with comparison to my work , we 'll find you 're mistaken . - No offence , but ... - We 'll know soon enough . The bigger effects will start any day . - Rebecca ? - Only you and Dad ever call me that . Right , Beck . So , what brings you to sunny DC ? The Board of Review is next week . Just trying to sense the mood upstairs . - How bad is it ? - Your crew crashed the space shuttle . Now , how good do you think it could be ? Sir , this is my life . I was studying for the Academy when I was 13 . - It still is , and has always been , my life . - It 's over . It 's over , Rebecca . I 'm sorry . Really ? What the hell 's the hurry here ? Rebecca , would you excuse me , please ? Excuse me . - Purcell . - Thomas . Look destiny may have caught up with us . Did Zimsky really try to give you his autograph ? Monsieur Zimsky . Conrad Zimsky ! Herr Zimsky . Superstar ! I think I skipped drunk . Went right to hangover . I spoke with the kids . They don 't sleep at night . They look at the sky and and they think it 's pretty . - Is there a chance that you 're wrong ? - No , the sky , man . The sky 's just the beginning . That 's high-altitude static discharge . I know . Dr Keyes . Your presence is required at the Pentagon . It 's my best buddies . Why don 't you join us for a drink ? - Join us for a ride , sir . - And if I were to say no ? Just asking . - Well , we have no sense of humour . - It 's true . - Oh ! - And we 're armed . Thank you . - Dr Keyes , welcome . - Thank you . Dr Zimsky says you made a useful contribution to his investigations . He wanted you to assist with the briefing . - That 's very generous of you , Dr Zimsky . - Science is a selfless business . Why don 't you begin , and I 'II ... fill in all the difficult bits . All right , I 'll put this as simply as I can . Everybody on Earth is dead in a year . Let me explain why . Wrapped around the Earth is an invisible field of energy . It 's made of electricity and magnetism , so it 's called the electromagnetic field . It 's where we get our magnetic poles . It protects us from cosmic radiation . - So this EM field is our friend . - But now ? But now , that field is falling apart . - Why ? - Why ? Does somebody have a can of air freshener ? It 's quick and dirty . The thin skin , that 's the Earth 's crust . It 's what we live on . It 's 30 miles thick . The meat here , call it the mantle . Forgetting all the funky transitions , it 's 2,000 miles thick . The core , the peach pit in the centre , that 's a tricky one . There 's two parts , the inner core and the outer core . OK ? The inner core is ... It 's a big solid chunk of iron . We think . That 's surrounded by the outer core , which is liquid . Yes , but most importantly , this liquid is constantly spinning in one direction . So , a trillion trillion tons of hot metal spinning at 1,000 miles an hour . So ... Right . Hot metal moving fast makes an electromagnetic field . This spinning liquid outer core is the engine that drives the EM field . - That 's where we have our problem . - This engine has stalled . The core of the Earth has stopped spinning . How could this happen ? We don 't know . - What 's the timeline here ? - As the EM field destabilises , we 'll start seeing isolated incidents , like planes falling from the sky . In a few months , everything electronic will be fried . Static discharge will create super-storms with mass lightning strikes everywhere . After that , it gets bad . The Earth 's EM field shields us from the solar winds , which are a lethal blend of radioactive particles and microwaves . When that shield collapses , microwave radiation will literally cook our planet . Dr Zimsky . This is the Sun . This is the Earth without the EM field . Would you ? Three months and we 're back in the Stone Age . A full year , the field collapses , and that . May I ? Feel free to throw up . I know I did . - So , how do we fix it ? - We can 't . - Not in my vocabulary . - Then add it . It 's impossible . The core 's the size of Mars . It 's jump-starting a planet . It 's superheated molten iron and nickel at 9,000 Fahrenheit , 2,000 miles down , 1,000 miles thick . The deepest we 've ever been is seven miles . With a two-inch drill bit . - If we can go into space ... - Space is easy . It 's empty . It 'd be millions of pounds of pressure per square inch ! Even if we came up with a brilliant plan to fix the core , we just can 't get there ! Yes , but what if we could ? Hello , Braz . Why the hell aren 't you dead yet ? OK , this way . - Well , that went better than I expected . - Dr Brazzelton , - I see you know Dr Zimsky . - 20 years ago , he stole my research . - After that , we kind of lost touch . - Research that was equally mine . I don 't recall a cheque from the patents . All right , Braz , 20 years in the desert makes you a prophet and a martyr . We 're here about your ship . OK , I 'm combining high-frequency pulse lasers with resonance tube ultrasonics . If you 've seen ultrasonics break up a kidney stone , it 's the same here . You can put your helmets on now . Firing ! OK , I 'm officially impressed . All right . You 've made some progress with the engine . We 'll grant you . Have you begun to think about a shell ? OK , this is Alex . OK , good . Here we have a concrete block and , in the back of that , we have a two-inch steel plate . OK , ready ? And we are firing . - Voila ! - That 's ... - Impossible . - I combined the crystals in a tungsten-titanium matrix at super-cool temperatures , - and that 's what did the trick . - The applications for this are ... - What do you call this material ? - Its real name has 37 syllables . I call it unobtanium . Unobtanium ? The unobtanium transforms the heat and pressure into energy , reinforcing the ship , so the hotter and deeper she gets , the stronger she gets . - Theoretically . - Theoretically ? With this ! This is Johnson , don 't mind him . This is the prototype for the cockpit here . When do you think the ship will be operational ? When I get my fabrication methods perfected . Twelve ... ten years . What would it take to get it done in three months ? $ 50 billion ! I ... Will you take a cheque ? Use a credit card . You get miles . Shit ! Mr Finch , this is the FBI . We have a warrant . Purge ! Come on ! FBI ! Freeze ! OK , I know these look like computers ... - Totally not . - Theodore Donald Finch . Carnegie-Mellon University , MIT , worked at Sun , Lucent , RAND Corp. My handle 's Rat . - 63 computer fraud indictments ... - 64 . Two convictions . This is strike three , Mr Finch . Wait . You aren 't here to whack me , are you ? Because I was really hoping to have sex before that happened . The FBI , whose database you crippled , say you 're the best in the business . - So you get a choice . - If I say no ? Excuse me , but is this really the best we could do ? I mean ... - How many languages do you speak ? - Five , actually . Well , I speak one , one-zero-one-zero-zero . With that , I could steal your money , your secrets , your sexual fantasies , your whole life . Any country , any place , any time I want . We multi-task like you breathe . I couldn 't think as slow as you if I tried . - Do you have any idea who I am ? - Let 's just give the kid a break . OK . It 's a phone , it 's just a phone . Rat , we got a big problem . A lot of people are going to die . We need your help . - What help ? - Information control . Controlling the Internet information flow . - Nobody controls the Net . - Could you ? With unlimited resources ? You want me to hack the planet ? He wants me to hack the planet . You 've got free long distance on that . Forever . OK , if I decide to do this , I 'm going to need an unlimited supply of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets . Hot Pockets . - They help me concentrate . - Sounds fair . Major Childs , they 're ready for you . Major Childs , a clarification . You were solely responsible for the descent vectors for the shuttle ? - Correct ? - Yes . We 've determined that the Endeavour 's landing mishap was caused by biased data from the ground , due to a geomagnetic disturbance . Your resourcefulness in determining the descent vectors proved that you have exceptional navigational skills . You 're a credit to yourself , the Space Program and the US Air Force . Congratulations , Major . You are reassigned , with Commander Iverson and Flight Director Stickley , to a new mission . Transportation is waiting outside . Good luck and Godspeed , Major . - Are you sure you want to wear this tie ? - Why ? I don 't know . You look so nervous about it . You look so ... - How are you holding up ? - I 'm good . I 'm good . I 'm about to tell people the world is going to end . - I 've had better days . - You look good . - You don 't . - Why did he touch his tie ? Thomas , can we speak ? Wouldn 't you rather I did this ? - Given my reputation ... - No , Keyes is in the lead . Yes . This is history 's most important scientific operation . - Given my status , I feel that it 's my job ... - Project Destiny was your job , Zimsky . And you went beyond authorised limits ! I still ... I want to know if Destiny caused this problem . It 's highly unlikely . But it may be the solution . - Now , I have not finished checking ... - Excuse me . Rebecca , I 'm so glad I was wrong . - Right over left ... No , the other left . - Gentlemen . Gentlemen . Commander Iverson , Major Childs , this is your crew . Dr Brazzelton knows the ship . Dr Zimsky knows the planet . Dr Leveque knows the weapons system . - Excuse me , ladies first . Hi . - And Dr Keyes ... Dr Keyes built the navigation system . So ... - Hi , Rebecca Childs . - Bob Iverson . These are your fellow ... What ? - Terranauts ? - Hello ? All this brainpower is starting to smell like burning batteries . Come and join in . - The simplest things are the hardest . - It 's official . I 'm the least qualified here . - I 'm sure the people in charge trust you . - Well , the problem is that I 'm in charge . - Yeah , I know ! - Can I help ? Yes , please . You 're an astronaut and you can tie a Windsor ? Anything you can 't do ? Not that I 'm aware of . - I find that incredibly intimidating . - Yep . Most people do . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Let me introduce our project leader , Dr Joshua Keyes . Thank you . Good evening . This looks like a meeting for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous . I know you 're all the finest in your fields and have come a long way to be here . So , I 'll outline our programme over the next three months . Dr Brazzelton will supervise the building of a ship for reaching our planet 's centre . It will deliver an explosive charge large enough to restart its core . Dr Zimsky will calculate the scale of explosion needed . I designed this to simulate the effect of nuclear detonations on the core . If I 'm correct , a tiny nudge in any direction will return the core to normal . - What 's a " tiny nudge " ? - Around 1,000 megaton . - Any more would create core instability . - We made a few 200-megaton devices . Braz , do you think the ship can handle five of them ? - Yeah . I can enlarge the ejection pods . - Forgive me . I know I 'm not the expert here , but what if the core is thicker or thinner ? I mean , won 't that affect the way the explosions are ... Yes , yes , yes . And what if the core is made of cheese ? This is all best guess , Commander . That 's all science is is best guess . So you don 't know . With luck , irony will back the good guys . The world 's biggest weapons of mass destruction will save it . The ship will be run by an experimental nuclear reactor and have six compartments , like cars on a train . The locomotive , navigation , living quarters , engineering , bomb compartment , and finally , the weapons control module . Up to 45 degrees , every compartment will be held level by these gimbals . But if we do breach a section , bulkhead doors engage automatically , seal off the section in red , and eject . Is ejection the best option ? Only option . Each damaged compartment degrades the entire hull . The objective is simple . The obstacles are gigantic . We 'll need all the help in the world . But to avoid panic and chaos , the public can 't know what 's happening , which is where Mr Rat comes in . It 's a computer virus that seeks out files anywhere on the Web that contain keywords we designate and wipes them out . This is my kung fu , and it is strong . There are a million puzzles ahead and three months to solve them . But we have a committed , ingenious team and every resource available . The world 's best scientific and technical talents are with us . With your help , we can , we must , succeed ! - Feedback ! - Talk to me ! - We 're losing structural integrity . - No , it 's an impeller fault . No , if it were ... - Braz , make the call ! - No , I should . 65 knots ! Depth , 85,000 feet . It 's a disaster ! What part of " talk to me " don 't you get ? For the twenty-second time , everyone on Earth is dead . Let 's take a little quiet time , and you all try again . - Hey . - Hi . What is this ? It 's ... I invented it . It 's how you 're going to steer underground . It 's not good reception . - You 're looking through three feet of lead at 50 yards away , so ... it ain 't bad . It 's like a CAT scan at a hospital , but it 's souped-up . I made it for surveys . The Government bought it and made me a consultant . Sorry , it 's really delicate and I have it just how I want it . So ... Excuse me . They called me in when the pacemakers quit and - boom ! - I 'm Apocalypse Boy . - Apocalypse Boy ? - Yeah . I 'm having T-shirts made up . Well , hats sell better . It 's funny , - because that 's right where it should be . - Well ... Sorry I 'm ragged . I 'm getting this to focus correctly . - This is cool , but can I ... ? - Well ... It 's better . It 's better . God , I hate this sky . - Crashing one ship isn 't enough for you ? - Practice makes perfect . - It doesn 't make you ready for that seat . - So you keep reminding me , sir . I doubt you 'll even listen to this , but I 'm going to give it a shot . Being a leader isn 't about ability . It 's about responsibility . - Got it . - You don 't . You 're not just responsible for making good decisions , but also bad ones , and be ready to make the shitty call . - Why do you think I 'm not ? - Because you 're so good . You haven 't hit anything you couldn 't beat . You figured out how to save the shuttle . Made me look like an ass . It 's just that you 're used to winning . And you 're not really a leader until you 've lost . - $ 20 billion has been spent on this ... - The chefs at NASA ... I wouldn 't call them chefs ! - I want wine . - I 'll cook for you . No worries . - It 's five days . I think ... - Whoa ! High-level static discharge . We should check this out . This doesn 't look so good . - Lightning super-storm . - All over the world . Got ' em . Tracking . Rome does not look good . - It 's decaying faster than we thought . - It 's just the start . Soon there 'll be EM spikes and microwaves . Get this ship in the ground . Now . - Summer in the Pacific . - Yeah , the world 's inside out . I was saving this for later , but ... this is the time . - Josh , do you mind ? - Not at all , yeah . - We should name this baby . - She 's called Virgil , actually . The poet that led our man into Hell ? Appropriate . Well , here 's to Virgil ! - To the planet . - To Virgil . No flashbulbs , no press . Nobody cheering . It 's weird . Let 's go . - Cabin pressure PSI , 3.5 . - Check . Re-press open . - And re-press VLV closed . - Check . - Fluid dump valve ... - We are beginning our journey into the heart of the cosmos , into the very core of our planet . Will we find therein the secrets of the universe the mysteries of time ... - Circuit lock-up hope for the future ? - And , signal . Deep Earth Control , this is Virgil . Signal check . This is Deep Earth Control . I have thumbs-up across the board . You are clear to initiate power-up . - Reactor power confirmed . - At 1,000 RPM , we will count down on your mark . - Pad leader , stand by for launch . - All right , Virgil . - Mark . - Gantry count : Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , launch ! 500 feet . Levelling out . OK , guys . Let 's swing forward . - 800 feet . - Light ' em up , Beck . - Gyro levelling operational . - Hull integrity holding . I 'm going to keep her nose down about 15 degrees and ... Oh , my goodness ! - They 're singing to us . - The resonance tubes are powered up . They vibrate subsonically . So , we 're singing to them . - What 's our depth ? - 1,600 feet , plenty of room both sides . - Hull is OK . - You sure ? Let 's raise impeller speed for control . - Stick , I 'm getting a seismic reading . - What 's happening ? Earthquake . - Still like the water-launch idea ? - I chose this location as the crust is thin here , but ... there 's lots of seismic activity ! 4,000 feet . See that ? It 's not good . We 're losing steering . 14,000 feet . OK , fasten your seat belts . We 're turning into the skid . - 18,000 , 18,500 ... - They 're going way too fast . - 21,000 feet . - We hit the wall , we 're rabbits on a road . - Pressure ... - What ? - You said it was indestructible ! - We need more pressure . - We 're at 25,000 feet . Pull out . - Can 't . We 're locked in . Go to full throttle . Stand by to engage lasers , please . We hit bottom in ten seconds ! Hold on . The lasers will fire . No , there 's not enough time to power up . - 27,000 feet . - The lasers will deploy . - 29,000 feet . - Do it ! - Do it ! - Now ! - We 've got a signal ! - All right ! All right , switching on electron spin-burst transmitters . Plotting through lowest density material , checks every five minutes . Hull integrity 100 % % % , reactor power 100 % % % . - All green on the bomb compartment . - Speed 60 knots . Hot damn ! We 'll be through the crust in 15 minutes and into the mantle . 24 hours to the core and then , assuming we survive 15 hours to the inner core border . - They 're doing well . - The crust is just rock . Now it hots up . - Virgil , status check ? - We 're going into the mantle . Come on , come on . Exterior pressure is 800,000 pounds per square inch and hull integrity is 100 % % % . It 's as if we 're diving through the planet 's memories . But we are about to pass from memory into madness . But ... Are you doing that Carl Sagan narration all the way to the core ? - Pardon ? - I said ... - I have an obligation to my students ... - To make a book deal ! Two ! - I read that last book . It wasn 't good . - When did you learn to read ? You amaze me ! People ! Doctors Zimsky and Keyes . You 're our geophysicists . - What do you make of this ? - The mantle is a chemical hodgepodge of various elements ... Say it with me , " I don 't know . " Well , wise men say , " When in doubt , you should go around . " No , it 's too big . We turn too slow . Anything we can 't go through displays as black . So , what 's static ? - It 's nothing . - What do you mean ? It 's nothing . It 's empty space . - I never taught the computer this ! - I never taught Virgil to fly ! Oh , God ! Oh , dear God ! - Serge , are you all right ? - Yeah . - Anybody hurt ? - No . You OK ? - Yeah . - What is that ? From the cooling system . Shut it down . - I told you to go around . Nobody listens . - Where in God 's name are we ? Whatever has us jammed is inside our lasers . Shut ' em down . We 're not going anywhere . Powering down . Josh , is there any image you can pull up ? No . Whatever it is , it 's also inside our MRI cameras . - We have to go outside . - What ? Believe me . I hate to admit it , but I think he 's right . - I 'm coming to get samples . - Wait . The only way out is the way we came in , through the impeller outlet ... is the way we came in , through the impeller outlet ... Which is at 5,000 degrees . I 'll just flush it with liquid nitrogen from the cooling system . The cooling system that 's keeping us from roasting ? Well , just a small part of it . Alternatives ? Anybody ? That 's it . - It 's like a giant , giant crystal . - Where the hell are we ? Well , the good news is , it looks like the suits can take the pressure . It 's jammed the laser assembly . - Hope they 'll still function . - Careful ! OK . Got it . - Beck , try the lights , would you ? - Lighting up . - It 's magnificent . - Oh , my God ! Aladdin 's cave . It 's like a crystal Grand Canyon . I think it 's a geode . I don 't understand how it 's survived down here . Cobalt shell ? No . I mean , in a magma environment at 5,000 degrees . Something must protect it . Unbelievable . - Zimsky ? - Yeah ? We 're in a giant gem bubble , wrapped in a cobalt cocoon , 700 miles below the surface of the Earth ... Hell of a day . Yes , it is . - I 'll start cutting . - OK . I 'll check the hull . - Call me if you need me . - OK . Oh , no ! - Zimsky ! - Look , it 's an amethyst . God ! We 've breached the shell ! You don 't have to be here ! I want you inside . Well , that means me . Orders are orders . Wait , Josh ! The problem is I 'm losing oxygen . - What can I do ? - Check the feeds . Check the feeds for me , Josh ! - Quick ! - I 'm coming ! - Guys , 3 minutes until the lava gets us ! - Come on , guys . Come on . It 's not going to work without oxygen ! We 're losing oxygen ! - I 've fixed it . Cut ! - That 's good . It 's working well now . That 's good , Josh ! Yeah ! - Josh 's vital signs are dropping . - What ? Serge ! Almost there . Yeah , almost there , Josh . Josh ! Joshua ! - OK , I need the oxygen . - Braz , got that ? - Connected ! - Good . I 've got to check these lasers . OK , Beck , turn them over . - Pre-lasers only , OK ? - Initiating . This had better work . The tide 's really coming in . Yes ! We 're going to swim out of this one . Bob ? Bob ? - Come on , it 's over . - OK . Beck ! We 're coming in ! Initiate start sequence . Beck ! You hear ? - Careful . - Start the impellers ! The door ! Activate bulkhead doors ! Now , Beck ! You OK ? - You 're OK . - Good job . - Thank you . - Well done , well done . So , we have some good news and we have some bad news . I 'll take good news . Well , we 're alive and we 're moving . That 's ... that 's good news . It is hot in here . That nitro we flushed out is causing overheating . - I 'm going to adjust it . - I 'll help . - I 'm fine . - OK . - I 'm going to check your heartbeat , OK ? - Thanks , Braz . Appreciate it . - That 's the bad news ? It 's not too bad . - No . Commander Iverson died , but we 're living , and he 'd want us to complete our mission . So I think it 's important that we all ... It 's all right . Thank you . I 'm sorry . Let 's give him a second , OK ? He deserved that . This all seems too big , doesn 't it ? You 're attempting the impossible . You 're trying to save the world and it 's overwhelming . I came to save my wife and children . Six billion lives ! It 's too much . I hope I 'm smart enough and brave enough to save three . You did a nice job , Joshua . Very nice . - You 'd have done the same . - Maybe . Serge . - Who 's steering this ship ? - Video screen autopilot . - Hope he knows the way . - You and me both . So , you 're really a college professor ? You 're not from the CIA or the NSA or any of those three-letter places ? No . I am a boring college professor . Wrong place , wrong place . That was the bravest thing I 've ever seen . I just ... Listen , the lack of oxygen kept me from weeping like a little girl . As is my custom in dangerous situations . Guys , we 're close to the mantle / core interface . Where are you ? Keys in , Dr Brazzelton . Ready ? We are in the luxurious , beautiful weapons control , - checking the controls on the nukes . - It 's my daughter 's birthday . - Chantalle ? - Yeah . Ready ? Three , two and one . - Thanks . - Green ? All green . Great . So , we have to synchronise the babies now . One second . There ! Now , let 's put them to bed . Zimsky , come up . - Yes ? - We don 't go through black . - Yes . Please don 't . - What 's this ? They 're scattered everywhere . God ! They 're diamonds . Great . You might want to sit and buckle up . We 're on a collision course here . Ready ? Careful . We 're dodging diamonds the size of Cape Cod . Hang on . She 's not nimble . - I want some . - Can I help ? OK . It 's OK . OK , it looks like we 're in the clear . Breach ! Weapons control , get out now ! Serge ! Serge ! What the hell are you doing ? Come on ! My notebook ! - Take the timers ! Joshua ! - Come on , Serge ! Come on ! My notes , you 'll need them ! God , no ! Serge ! - It 's OK . - Serge ! Come on , Serge ! Serge ! - Get the box ! - No , Josh ! We can override it ! Braz , we can get him ! Hold on , hold on ! Beck ! Beck , override the ejection system ! No ! One damaged compartment threatens the whole ship . Beck ! Beck ! Override the ejection system ! We 're here . We 're not forgetting you . - Josh , can you hear me ? - Buddy , look in your monitor right now . I 'm right here . I can 't see you . Braz is overriding the doors manually . Braz , how long ? Joshua ? I 'm going as fast as I can ! - I 'm scared . - We 'll do it now . Two seconds , OK ? - Josh ! - Beck , override the ejection systems . Damn , I don 't think Beck can hear me . Serge , look at me now ! We 're right here . I 'm going to get you out . We 're working on it . All right ? - Stay with me here , OK ? - I don 't know what to do . You can hear me now ? OK . Here I am . I 'm not going to let you go , man . All right ? Stay with me here , OK ? I 'm coming to Paris and we 'll go out , OK ? After this is all done . - Josh ! - Serge ! Serge ! Serge ! Did you reset the overrides ? I never pushed them . You let him die . You want to know ? I killed him when I hit the diamond and didn 't hit the override . Do you want me to feel any worse than I already do ? - Why are you so smug ? - Could you have made the decision ? Yes ! If you 'd hit that switch , I could 've got him out ! I was yelling for you ! Take it and look at it ! I was two inches from him , and I told you to put the door up and you didn 't ! I was screaming for you ! Why didn 't you do it ? Because I had to make that decision . Fate or God ... No ! Damn it , you leave God out of this ! - He died so we could complete our job ! - Right , saving the world ! Not the whole world , Josh ! Just three of ' em . Virgil , you 're approaching core interface . Are you good to go ? Josh ? Josh , can you hear me ? Josh , can you hear me ? Ready as we 'll ever be , Stick . Dr Keyes ... Right here . Deep Earth , we 're good to go . We just got a huge speed jump to 95 knots . - 110 . - 130 . 140 . It 's because the core 's density is lighter than our estimates . So much for best guesses . At this rate , we 'll hit the inner core in about five hours . We got some luck . - Braz . - Yeah ? Punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation . Please tell me this is enough . Failure ? The 1,000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled here won 't cut it ? - No . This core material 's too thin . - What ? The explosion 's energy waves won 't spread far enough . That 's it . We go home . We go home . Our commander and weapons specialist are dead . Weapons control is gone . We don 't know if we can arm the weapons . And our plan to fix the core no longer works . We 've failed . - We have not failed ! - We have failed , and we go home . - We go to the alternative . - What ? General , this is Dr Conrad Zimsky . Destiny is a go . - Repeat , Destiny is a go . - Damn . I need to know everything to do my job . You don 't have to know this . General , it is my job to ensure the safety of this mission . Anything that affects it is my business . What 's Destiny ? It 's a device . Deep Earth Seismic Trigger Initiative . D-E-S-T-l-N-I . " Destiny " . We believed our enemies were building a weapon to trigger seismic events . They could create massive earthquakes under our territory . - No way of telling who did it . - So ? We built one , too . MAD : Mutually Assured Destruction . - A perfect acronym . - Beautiful . They built it first . I built it better . I beamed strong electromagnetic energy down fault lines , - and ... - Zimsky . - How do you know Destiny would work ? - Because it already did . This isn 't a fluke . We killed the planet . You say the core 's too big to hit with anything but nukes . The core 's a big engine . Throw in a small wrench , you can still stall it . Deep Earth , this is Virgil . We require clarification on Project Destiny 's status . - Why weren 't we told ? - You didn 't need to know . You may not like it , but it 's my job , and I do it for my country . And if we don 't develop these devices , someone worse will . I swear , no one in this administration , no one , had any idea that this could happen . So the device that killed the planet is your back-up ? An electric shock can stop a heart and certainly restart one . Destiny will work . No , it won 't work ! If you fire that thing with the core stalled , - it 'll terminally destabilise it . - Yes , it 's a risk . But I hardly see there 's an alternative . Every volcano will blow . The earthquakes will rip us to pieces . - Dr Keyes . - What ? I 'm afraid it 's all we 've got . Now , I have orders from the President . - Come home . We go to plan B. - What about plan C ? - What ? - Plan C. We continue on , we restart the core , somehow . We don 't do it , you fire Destiny . - I can 't wait for you to get clear . - Don 't . We fail , fire Destiny . - Ridiculous ! - What else ? Are you kidding ? If they do it , we 're dead ! We 'll be lucky to get back if we go now ! Virgil , I 'm telling you now , we will fire Destiny . We need to do so as quickly as possible . If you 're still there , you 'll be destroyed ... Rebecca ? Don 't make me do this . Plan C. It 's your call , Commander . Majority decision . We 're going in . I 'm sorry , sir . You 're suicidal morons ! What are you , crazy ? Restart the core " somehow " ? Great idea ! I can 't believe I 'm stuck in this septic tank with lunatics ! All of you may have nothing to lose ! I have my life to lose , thank you ! Turn it around ! He said go , we go ! You want to be heroes ? Martyrs ? What ? You 're crazy ! Turn it around ! No , I won 't die like this ! - I don 't want to die ! - It 's not about us ! There 's three people ... Shut up ! It 's not a stupid ship . I had to . Had to happen sometime . What is that ? It 's the monitoring station that tracks EM pulses . God , no ! Just talk , Mr Rat . That 's a good boy . Remember those invisible microwaves that Josh was talking about ? They 're here . It 's a parking lot ... Oh , my God ! With this horrific breaking news , we go live to San Francisco to Leo Jacks . It 's hard to believe that half of San Francisco is in ruins today after the most devastating and baffling event in our history . It 's a horrific situation here . Thousands are dead . Many are missing . It 's hotels , - hospitals ... - Bring up the power grid . The whole west coast is out . We 're going to need every drop of juice east of the Rockies to fire Destiny . Another EM spike , we won 't have the power . Give them more time . There isn 't any . Call Destiny . I 'm lodging a formal complaint with the Department of Defense . - Rat to Josh . - Go , Rat . Here 's the EM data you 're primed for . Digging that . Primed for , primed for ... Prime numbers . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 ... There we go . James . Yes , sir ? Yes , sir . Here we go , folks ! This time ! Beautiful . Come on , baby ! Daddy wants to see the sky again . OK , OK . Let 's try it again . - Your torque is R across F. - No , your R is too small . - Right ... - Wait . Hold on , let me ... What are you laughing at ? It took me and 400 geniuses to devise the first plan . - You want to help ? - No . I want to go home . - It 's not going to happen . - Then we 're going to die . - True . - All right , let 's start from square one . The bulk modulus depends on density . Your torque is R across F , but you have to integrate volume . Here , here , just consider this . Now , what we 've got is ... R across F , we 're putting in pi . What 's V ? - For God 's sake ! - Right , I 'm hitting him again ! No ! I have a theory . - Interested ? - Yes ! Then , let me smoke and I 'll tell you . Thank God ! All right , look . We have to use wave interference , OK ? One explosion won 't do it . Think of stones in a pond . Drop a large stone into a pond , you get a big splash and it 's over . Drop a smaller stone , let the ripples weaken , and drop another , another , another , another , and fluid dynamics 101 . The ripples reinforce each other geometrically . They 're bigger as a whole , five smaller explosions ... Instead of one big bang . We hot-wire the nukes , as one does . We seed them through the core at locations accurate to the inch . We detonate them in a sequence accurate to the millisecond . Then we outrun the biggest nuclear shockwave in history . - Right . - Yeah . I mean , that should be fairly simple . Final calibration on both transmission systems . Cut the rouge , the red wire above the circuit . - OK . - No , wait ! Sorry . Cut it below . I don 't know what that means . Extensions A , B. We have check . - Increase reactor power . - Almost there . - We 're closing on the inner core . - The nukes are ready . - Let 's start . - No . The bombs can 't take these pressures out of that pod . Send them out of it , they 'll be crushed instantly . - I assume we have a plan D. - It 's Virgil 's compartments . Put a nuke in each section and eject the sections . They should stay intact long enough for the nuke to go off ... What ? Virgil 's not designed to eject undamaged compartments . These are the ejection mechanisms for the compartments . They 're all connected by a master gear . Kind of like keys on a key ring . We have to unlock the piston , releasing the compartments , - so the bombs can be ejected . - Where 's the master gear ? - In the crawl space we used to get out . - What 's it doing there ? I built this in 3 months . I didn 't think I 'd be sabotaging it . Sorry ! - One of us goes in ? - Correct . - With core fluid at 9,000 degrees ? - Yes . - Use nitrogen ? - We haven 't enough . 9,000 degrees . And our suits are built to withstand ... ? Half that , probably . So you 're saying whoever goes in is not coming back . - Together . - Yes , thank you . - Wait . - On three . - OK . - One , two , three ! Well , I 'd better go and get myself ready . No , wait ! Excuse me . Just a moment , may I see ? No ! May I ? - Yes . - Thank you . Magic . I mean , Braz , three straws of equal length . I mean ... - This is childish . Let 's do it again . - No , we will not . I thought you 'd be happy . - Not at being made a fool . - Why do you get to be the hero ? - It 's my ship . - That makes sense . For 20 years , I 've done nothing but Virgil . Virgil belongs to me , and I will not let her fail . I will not . Now , you want to know what 's worth dying for ? This ship . Building it , instead of imagining it . If Virgil needs more blood , it will be my blood . Now , I 'm going to go and get ready . Good to go . Beck . Josh . It 's a hell of a boat you built . I am really proud to have known you guys . Braz . Edward . Yes , Conrad ? You 're right . It is your ship . But I wish to God it had been ours . The chamber 's sealed , Beck . Ready . Open the hatch . Hang on , Braz . Hang on . Manual override complete ! We can still get you out . No ! Start the impeller . We got a job to do . Let 's do it . Let 's go . - Magnetic shielding systems are up . - Power levels 85 % % % . - Increase power to reactor ten . - Clear personnel . No , wait ! Jesus ! God ! I 'm sorry . She 's down . Nearing drop . We 've got to be accurate to the second here , boys . Drop in 35 seconds . And timer on ! Pull it ! Clear ... and ejecting . - OK . Initiate firing sequence . - Sir ... It 's our last shot . - Damn you . - Damn me ? Too late . Ten , nine , eight ... What 's that ? Got you ! ... four , three , two ... Someone 's diverted our energy . - Where 's it gone ? - It looks like Coney Island . Your kung fu is not strong . How long to get it back online ? Get to it ! General ! Is there something I can do for you ? Timer on . Clear . Ejecting . Ejecting . Pull it . All right . Let 's go throw our last little 200 megaton-stone in the pond . - I wanted my name in nuclear physics . - The energy propagation ... High school physics . I took the wavelengths off the MRI . - And multiplied them by 800 . - 600 . But you compensated for the MRI bias ? We 've got to reset the timers ! It 's not the timers . It won 't work ! This isn 't enough . - What isn 't ? - The last bomb . - To complete the waveform ? - It has to be 30 % % % larger . That 's six or seven pounds of plutonium ! But from where ? An energy flare hit us , I can 't keep on course ! - Ejecting compartment in 50 seconds . - No , Beck ! Wait ! - Push ! - You push ! I can 't hear you . - It 's got my shoulder ! - Push ! Guys ? Get clear ! Get clear ! - The flare 's cut the coms ! - I can 't get it . Go . - I can 't ... - OK . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Can you hear me ? I 'm correcting course . Now ! Push it ! Ejecting in ten seconds ! Josh , go ! Get out ! Now ! Get out ! Now ! Go ! Josh ! For the last bomb , to make it larger , use the fuel rods from the reac ... Ejecting . I hear you , Zimsky , I hear you . Beck ! Beck , can you hear me ? If you have any better ideas , tell me now ! We 've only got three minutes to eject this one ! I can 't hear you . Beck . Josh ? Here , come on . Are you OK ? You OK ? - Would you take my gloves off ? - My God ! Please . I had to build the blast . I 'm sorry . - Hold on , let me get the first aid . - No . Stay here a second . - I was trying to call you . - I know . The coms were down . - Right . - I know what you did . - We haven 't enough energy ... - I know . ... to get back . - You did good . I would have done the same thing . Where 's Zimsky ? Come here . You did good . One minute to first detonation . 12 until the blast hits us . I was hoping we 'd suffocate first . Beck ! Beck ! Beck ! What if I got you enough power to fire the impeller ? Not the laser , the impeller ? From where ? The heat of the core . It 's 9,000 degrees . Unobtanium converts heat ! So , this whole damn ship 's like a big solar panel ! I need your help . Number two ! Come on ! Come on ! Here , in the great , infinite unknowable , man can come to know the most important thing of all . Himself . He can understand ... What the fuck am I doing ? - We 've got full rotation ! - It 's turning ! All right ! Where is it ? Come on , hurry up ! - Is that the last one ? - Yeah . Give it a couple of seconds . It worked ! Get ready to pull a few Gs . 420 knots . - This is better . - 440 . What 's the quake 's centre ? It 's one giant shockwave ! The planet 's healing itself . At this speed , we 're going to be home in a third of the time . We 're OK surfing these magma flows . Pray we don 't hit dead ends or we 'll miss those lasers ! OK , navigator , which way ? Fluid density 's greater on the left . Go with the flow . Where 're they headed ? She 's got out between tectonic plates , somewhere near Hawaii . They 're closing in on us too fast . Don 't know if I can ... You got it . We lost them , Stick , and I ... Where did our power go ? We 're powered by heat . It 's stone cold down here . Well , look on the bright side . - We won 't boil to death . - You always see the bright side ? Always . OK , let 's assess . We 've no communications . We 're maybe 800 feet down , but might as well be 800 miles . We 're in an unobtanium cigar tube with the sonar signature of a rock . We can make the ultrasonics burp , but no one 's checking those frequencies . And nobody even knows we 're alive . OK . Give me a minute . It 's hopeless . We must be close . Mr Rat , even if they 're still alive , - they can 't contact us . - Bridge . Our sub has a sonar contact . - Where do they think ? - Put it on the hydrophone . Whales . They 're off their usual path . That 's not unusual since that , what 's it called ? - " Orbital wobble " ? - Yeah , that 's what they call it . Thanks very much , Captain . - I think we 're done here . - General . This is the Captain . Stand down from SAR operations . It 's whales ! It 's whales ! Hey ! General ! It 's whales ! The ultrasonics ! They 're singing to them ! We 've got to find the whales ! November X-ray , this is November-Echo-6 - 1-0 . I 'm changing ... Hold on , I 'm seeing those whales now . Ball 's in the water . This is neat . The whales are circling something . We have a strong echo ! Depth 800 feet . There 's definitely something down there . - I said using the ultrasonics would work . - You ever get tired of being right ? Yes . So , what 's next for you ? A shower . Then back to NASA , I guess . You ? Deep dish pepperoni pizza , green peppers , onions , extra mushrooms , then a shower . And then back to the classroom . NASA could use a few good men , you know ? Yeah . Unfortunately , so could my freshman geophysics students . You know what makes me really , really angry ? Bob , Serge , Braz , Zimsky , no one 's going to ever know what they did , or why they died . Unless it all got out somehow . That 's unthinkable . Yeah . OK , here we go . Sweet . It seems the world owes its survival to the heroism of six remarkable individuals ... This extraordinary craft , Virgil , was captained by astronaut Bob Iverson ... - Edward Brazzelton ... - Dr Conrad Zimsky ... On Capitol Hill today , everyone asks the same question , " What is Project Destiny ? " Destiny , meet world . World , meet Destiny .

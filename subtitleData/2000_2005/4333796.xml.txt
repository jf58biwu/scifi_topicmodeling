 Hel , there appears to be ... an unusual amount of Bailey activity ... taking place on the surface . Far more than we 've ever monitored before . Keep an eye on it , Mauser . Right now we 're needed for another mission . Patch Voice through the lab 's comm system . You two need to hear this . You mean I actually get to put a voice ... with the Voice ? Patched in . Go ahead , Voice . One of our teams has turned against us , Hel . She 's British ! What ? The team leader has severed all communications with me . Your directive is to neutralize them at once . Neutralize them ? We have to take them out . If we 're going after another team , you better lay some serious firepower on me . Come on , Mauser , load me up . The hard stuff . Yeah ! There you go . Low-yield photon taser . Defensive use only . Futuristic pepper spray . Great . Hel , the other team is 2,000 meters down the shaft . There 's an abandoned level just ahead . The other team 's below us ! Voice , we 've reached the level . There 's a larger room down the corridor , Hel . You can set up an ambush there . This way . That 'd be a nice spot , Hel . Elevated position . They 'd never know what hit them . Hel , the other team is closing . No time . Flank them from that alcove , and we 'll take center stage . Come on , up and over . What you got , Sarge ? Five seconds to a clean shot . Take it now , Sarge ! No ! Quint ? Get down ! Voice , we 've got them pinned down ! Good work , Hel . You have the advantage . Eliminate them at once . Voice , we 've come under heavy fire . Time is of the essence , Quint . If there 's no other choice , eliminate Hel 's team . Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover ... there 's no place like home .

We 're sitting ducks if we stay here much longer . Back there . Ready web launchers . On my mark , Sarge . Now ! Now ! Whoa . We 've got to remember that move . You 're not kidding . Guys ! We 're okay , Cleo . But they 're good . They 're the best . That 's Quint 's team . What ? The same Quint 's team we met up with a few weeks back ? Huh-huh . Is that new kid Porter still with them ? Looked like it . Wait , that doesn 't make any sense . Those guys are totally loyal to Voice . Yeah , well , I say their loyalties have shifted . But don 't you want to know why ? I mean , we should at least try to talk to them . Cleo , they just tried to kill us . I don 't think they 're interested in talk . But we know them . I mean , we have to try . Hel , they 've already killed three other teams ... who 've tried to talk . Voice says they 've already taken out three teams . You see what they 're capable of , Cleo . We can 't afford to ask why . Quint , what is your status ? We 're regrouping . Do you have a read on Hel 's position ? Not at present . But I suggest you double back and take the offensive . There 's no other way out of here . There 's a ventilation shaft . It might take us onto the second level . If we can get above Hel 's team , we might - Hel 's probably thought of that . But we are running low on options . I 'll go . No , I 'll go . That 'll give you two a better chance . Of doing what ? Neutralizing Hel 's team ... by going out the way we just came in : full-on assault . I 'll be in touch . Voice , can you get a reading on Quint 's team ? Is there any other way out of here ? I 'm sorry , Hel , there 's too much structural interference ... for a sensor sweep . You 'll have to go in after them . Porter , I 've reached the second floor . Looks clear . I read . We 're in position . Copy that . Quint . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Cleopatra ? What are you doing ? I don 't have much time . Hel and Sarge think that I 'm looking ... for another way off this level . Listen , the Voice really has it in ... for you and your team , and Hel 's going to follow her orders ... even if it means taking you out . Cleopatra , listen to me . Why don 't you listen to me ? Quint ! Good job , Cleo . Yeah , great job , Cleo . Do you hear me ? Quint ! Where are you going ? Quint 's in trouble . Tell me this has all just been ... a real creative idea of foreplay . I wish I could . Please , Sarge , don 't . Voice , any news on the Bailey surface activity ? We 'll discuss that later , Hel . But for now , stay focused on the mission at hand . Hel , come in . Go ahead , Cleo . We have Quint . Uh , he tried to get above us , just as you thought . Voice , did you hear that ? Yes , Hel . I heard you . Your directive remains the same . Sarge must not hesitate to eliminate Quint ... while she has the chance . Please , Sarge , don 't . Sarge , do what you got to do . Sarge , think about what you 're doing . Think about what you 've done , Quint ! You killed three other teams . You betrayed the Voice . What are you talking about ? You 're the team that 's turned against the Voice . You 're the traitors . That 's some pretty good acting , huh , Cleo ? I don 't think he 's acting . What are you talkin ' about ? The Voice sent us to make contact with you ... when Hel stopped responding to her receptor . You 're the one who cut off communications with Voice . Wrong . Voice , give me something here . Sarge is going to slit my throat . Quint , ask Sarge about her sister Lily , how Sarge spared her life at the Betrayer factory . Sarge , tell me about your sister . Tell me about Lily . You saved her life at the Betrayer factory . I never told you that . No . Voice just did . Stand down , Hel . Something 's going on . Say again , Sarge ? Quint 's still talking to Voice . I know this will sound strange , but I think the Voice you 're hearing isn 't the real one . Sarge is mistaken . She 's been compromised , Hel . Either that , or Quint is the one in contact with the impostor Voice . Hel ! Hel , don 't shoot ! We 're coming down with Quint . Everything 's cool . Everything is not cool , Cleo . What are you talking about ? You talk to me fast , you two ! Hel , your Voice receptor 's been tapped . Hel , you must believe me . My security has not been compromised in any way . You 're being set up . Prove it . The Voice in Quint 's head knows about my sister , Hel , about our mission to the Betrayer factory . I think he 's on the level . Lara , they got Quint . Go for Hel . Quint ! Drop ! Porter , no ! Quint ? Hel , behind you ! Oh , there 's nothing quite like the sound ... of Voice teams killing each other . Cleo ! Make it quick , traitor . Hel , they think we 're the rogues . Hel , don 't question yourself . Finish your mission . Porter , no ! Lara ! Get out of there ! I 'll cover you ! We need to stop this . Talk to him ! Porter , Hel could 've killed me if she wanted to . I 'm not their prisoner . That 's what they want you to think ! They killed Quint ! Come on , Quint , come on , you 've got to tell Porter you 're still kickin ' . Come on . Cleo . Hmm ? That mimic thing that you do . Can you do Quint 's voice and get Porter to stand down ? Uh , no , I-I really can 't do guys . Come on , kid , don 't make me shoot you . Porter , let 's talk about this . So , Hel , now you want to talk ! Hel , you 're risking your entire team . Sarge has a clear shot . Finish this now . Voice , I thought you said your sensors were jammed . How do you know Sarge has a shot ? I 'm getting a clearer reading now , Hel . Eliminate them at once . No . Kill them now , Helen . " Helen " ? Creegan . Game 's over . Do you hear me , Creegan ? Here , Creegan , Creegan , Creegan . I know you 're here . You 'd want to see two teams blow each other away up close and personal . Why ? To distract us ... from your little Bailey playmates ? Come out , Creegan ! Show 's over . Isn 't it , Porter ? Listen to her , Porter . It 's over . Porter , get down ! So close , Helen . Looks like I 'll just have to kill you myself . Hel , I 've reacquired your signal . There are multiple signals behind you . Cleo , find cover ! Okay ! Lara , let 's play . Creegan ! Come on . Hel , Quint , I want Creegan alive . His shield 's too strong , Voice ! Don 't stop , Hel . This is starting to feel really good ! What are you and the Bailies up to , Creegan ? Oh , you 'll find out soon enough , Hel . You all will . You 're too late , Voice ! This has got to have better range . I got him ! C - Cleo , disengage ! Cleo ! No ! Cleo . Let her go , Creegan ! You had to try and talk Hel out of killing her friends . You couldn 't just shoot first and ask questions later , huh ? If you insist . She-she fried his shield generator ! Heads up . What 's it gonna be , Hel ? Hel , we have our directive . Voice wants Creegan alive . Hel , this is connected to the Bailies . During Creegan 's little game , their activity has increased . Take Creegan back to the prison level ... and return to the lab for further directives . Hey ! You 've got a visitor . Stand back from the energy screen . You 've got one hour . After that , he won 't be talking to anyone . He said , " Stand back . " Or don 't you listen ? It 's my job to listen , Mr. Creegan . I 'm your Confessor . What makes you think I want to confess anything ? It is the right of every condemned man ... to unburden his soul , Mr. Creegan . If you don 't want to talk , that 's fine . Believe me , I 'm happy to get the hell out of this place . That 's not very charitable . You know how it works , Creegan . I have the power to open my mind to you . I can take your sins . Now , what sane man would want to do that ... for you ? My sins are my own . I treasure them . I cherish them . Why would I want to share them with you ? Oh . Murder ? Betrayal ? These are the precious memories ... you want to take from this world ? You don 't get it , do you ? They 're about to execute me for sins of the past , things I 've already done . But it 's the crime I 'm about to commit ... that you 'll all pay most dearly . What are you talking about ? There 's no stopping it . When I die , the world dies with me . What did you mean , the world ends with you ? It 's pretty self-explanatory . I will be solely responsible ... for the extermination of the entire human race . How 's that for a legacy ? The world seems safe from you now , Mr. Creegan . Tell me , how do you plan to go about this holocaust ? I thought you could see into my soul , Confessor . You tell me : How does the world end ? No , I told you that I can only accept ... the thoughts you choose to give me . Are you ready to reveal yourself ? Are you ? I don 't have any secrets . Hmm . Nice . To answer your question , I don 't need to be free to have my goals achieved . I set this plan in motion a long time ago . So how will you know if your plan 's a success ? I mean , after you 're gone . Faith , Confessor . Faith that the future will unfold as I ordained it , despite her best efforts to stop me . Whose best efforts ? Voice . Voice ? The Voice ? And her precious teams of resistance fighters . You see , now I know you 're joking . The Voice ? It 's a myth . It 's a children 's story . She 's as real as you and me , my friend . I used to be close to Voice not so long ago . Before my expulsion . Before she became a recluse ... and such a thorn in my side . What the hell is that ? I don 't know , but I don 't like it . Tuck and roll . So , this vendetta of yours has lasted for ... Years . Without much success , until recently . The tides turned when I first learned the location of Mauser , a reprogrammed Betrayer ... assigned to Voice 's flagship team . You see , my plan was to trace Voice ... through Mauser 's internal link to her network . Creegan , we 're not secure . I don 't care . I want Mauser . Hel , have you secured Mauser ? Not yet . Mauser must not be captured . If you can 't secure him , eliminate him . Now , that wasn 't so hard , was it ? Mauser 's dead . Not dead , he 's just offline . Imagine my surprise ... when I discovered the daughter of a former colleague ... and one of my closest friends ... was the leader of this particular Voice team . Creegan ! My plan for Mauser would be unsuccessful , but it didn 't matter ... for on that day , Voice had shown me her weakness : Helen . The lever I would use to overturn her . And in turn ... Helen showed me her own weakness . Hey there , little girl . Hel , what 's happening ? He 's here , Voice . My father . Hel , that 's not possible . He 's dead . Hel , listen to me . Hel , can you hear me ? Hel , say something . Creegan . Shh . Try not to speak , Hel . No , don 't move Helen , you 'll disrupt the link . Hello again , Voice . Creegan . I should 've known it was you . Thank you , Voice . That 's all I needed . Voice , Creegan 's tracing you through my receptor . Don 't transmit ! I 'm too brilliant for that , Voice . Shutting up won 't save you . My tracer will locate you in minutes . You did this , Creegan . You caused the explosion . And like clockwork , you dispatched Hel . Your " A " number one foot soldier ... who I knew could be lured away from the pack ... simply be tapping into ... that little obsessed part of her psyche : Daddy . Voice command . Enable self-destruct . Hel , what are you doing ? Yes , Hel , pray tell . The way I see it , I die , the receptor dies with me . No receptor , no Voice , no trace . Hel , is this the only option ? Yes ! Hel , I find your sudden zest for death ... undeniably delicious . Hook right . It 's only zest when you 're dying with me . Any more surprises ... and I won 't be responsible for my actions . Keep tracing ! So , what do you think , Voice ? You really think the daughter of your most valued follower ... has it in her to end her own life ? No . Voice hasn 't told you , huh , Hel ? You found that to be a recurring trait of hers lately ? The more she says , the less you know . Isn 't that really infuriating ? Yep , Dad and the Voice were really tight ! Creegan 's about to compromise my location . He 's close . We 're close , aren 't we , Hel ? You want what I want . Let 's sit down with the Voice ... and clear some things up , eh ? Hel ! Creegan . Abort self-destruct . That 's my Hel ! Hel , what are you doing ? Redirect half-burst . This isn 't over . So tell me , how did you get away from Voice ? I never make a plan without leaving an escape route . And yet , here you are . I thought you were here to comfort me ... in my final hour , Confessor . Sometimes vigorous self-examination ... is the path to peace . Yeah , yeah , right . Well , you know , I 've only got 30 minutes to live here , so ... I 'm sorry . Please continue . Now , let me guess : Your narrow escape from Voice doesn 't discourage you ... from going after her again , right ? Well , if at first you don 't succeed ... Why ? What do you mean ? The Voice . If she really exists , she 's fighting a noble cause : to liberate us all . And these people who are fighting for her ... are just as dedicated . What could this woman have possibly done to you ... to justify this lust for vengeance , this mad fantasy of world destruction ? Five hundred years , five centuries , my legions of armies have readied themselves ... to fulfill their destiny . My destiny ! I will not be denied by some cut-rate scientist ... and her army of insolent thugs ! Well done . Not only did your attempt to kill two Voice teams at once fail , but you 've left yourself ... without an escape route this time . When you play the odds , sometimes you eat the bear , sometimes the bear eats you . The bear ? It 's all becoming clear now , what you said a moment ago ... about having to wait 500 years ... to fulfill your destiny . Well , I 'm told I have a penchant for hyperbole . And a knowledge of extinct animals . And what about your skin ? Oh , please , I 'm a little sensitive about it . It 's damage caused by extensive exposure to cryo-fluid , isn 't it ? You 're what they call a thaw . You 're five centuries old . We all have our little secrets . That 's why you 're here , isn 't it ? To learn my secrets ? Isn 't that right ... Voice ? What did you call me ? You almost had me , Voice . But a confessor listens . He doesn 't challenge , doesn 't provoke . Oh , come on , Voice ! I 've shown you mine , time to show me yours ! You are mad . Don 't be shy . You know what I want . Hel wasn 't afraid to come and ask for the truth , and I gave it to her ! Hel , your father is dead . Same old story , and you 're sticking to it . It 's the truth . I 've heard enough of your truth . Hel , don 't do this . After all we 've been through together , everything we 've achieved . It 's meaningless without trust , and I don 't trust you anymore , not where my father 's concerned . We can resolve this , Hel . If you 'll just give me the chance , I 'll explain everything to you . You had your chance . We do have posted visiting hours , Hel . You listen to me , you freak . My father 's alive , and you 're going to help me find him . Cara , my friend , I don 't believe it . You actually did it . Did what ? Where is he ? I can take you to him , but it 'll cost you more than my freedom . What do you want now ? You know what I want ! No . All my life , Voice has stood in my way . Her and her precious little teams , fighting for an impossible cause . Well , not anymore . You 're going to help me achieve my lifelong dream , Hel . You give me Voice , or there 's no deal . Where do we start ? It 's a sionic transplane generator . Used correctly , it 's the perfect infiltration device Daddy and I helped Voice conceive . You saw the holo-photo , Hel . We were one big happy think tank down here , huh , Harge ? I thought your father died keeping this out of my hands . I 'll take that . Naturally . Oh , my God ! Now , Hel , your journey is over . Dad ? I just hate long hellos . Get him ! You go get Daddy , I 'll wait here . The hell you will . Damn it , Helen , get out of here now ! Not without you ! Get the girl ! Some family reunion , huh ? Fireworks and everything . So , you are Creegan . In the flesh . We 've received your communication . You have served us well . You will be rewarded . Oh , will I ever . Just ask me , Voice ! Your world 's about to end in 20 minutes , and you 're here to find out how to save it ! Voice . How nice it is to see you again . How did you forge an alliance with the Bailies , Creegan ? You 're still beautiful . Creegan , I give you one last chance to make amends . Who leads the Bailies ? I do . Or more precisely , I did . Well ! Looks like they 've developed a will of their own . It 's over , Voice . Surely now you see how futile your puny little resistance has been in the face of their power . Tell me how to stop them , Creegan . The name 's Bailey . George Bailey . At least I get to live long enough to see this day come . The day when my children will finally inherit the Earth . Why did you do it ? Create those monsters . Five hundred years ago , this planet was dying , infected by a swarming plague of humanity . So you thought you would save the world ... by destroying the human race ? Not at first . Initially the Bailies were environmental control units ... cleaning up the mess that we humans left behind . Until you decided we humans were the mess . Not me . In due time , they decided that for themselves . I just happened to agree with them . It 's not too late . The Bailies have accomplished what you designed them to do . The world is new again . You can give it back to us . What makes you think you deserve it ? How do we stop them ? You can 't ! The Bailies may have been your legacy , Creegan , but my ancestors left us a legacy as well : the shaft defense cannons , the only weapons capable of destroying a Bailey . We 've moved them to the surface . This war isn 't over yet , Creegan . It 's just beginning . Hel , do you read me ? Voice ! I read you , Voice . Go ahead . Creegan told me nothing before he died . Proceed with the counterattack . Understood , Voice . Commencing counterattack . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

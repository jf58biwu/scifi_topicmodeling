 Excuse me , can you tell me where I can find the supervisor ? Over there . Thank you . Your authorization and licenses , please ? Level 6 in Thermodynamics and Quantum Fusion . Well . Janeway . I 'm impressed . Thank you , sir . Now , if you could just manage to report to your shift on time . I 'm sorry . I boarded the wrong transport . I ended up at the Atmosphere Filtration Facility . They 're always looking for skilled workers . I 'm surprised they didn 't offer you a job . I promise , I won 't be late again . Well , it 's easy to get disoriented when you 're new here . I 've been in this city all my life , and I still get lost on occasion . Now , you 'll be monitoring the primary reactor coils . They process more than 8,000 metric ... 8,000 metric tons of tylium per second at 94 percent thermal efficiency . I memorized the specifications . Let me know if there 's anything you need . You 'll find we like to keep our workforce happy . I can already tell it 's going to be much better than my last job . The specifications you asked for . Thanks . Input Error 415 . Command Code Violation 2308 . Come on , shut off that damn alarm , and I promise I 'll never violate you again . You almost started a core overload . I would have corrected it . Well , I 'm sorry for interrupting then . And for eavesdropping . I overheard you talking to your console . It 's an old habit . Does it work ? I 'm not sure this control panel and I speak the same language yet . Well , if you need an interpreter ... Jaffen . Kathryn . I work just down there . That 's good to know . This station doesn 't require two operators . I don 't think we 've met . I 'm ... Employee 1326 . And you 're Employee 8584 . Since you 're new here , you may not be fully familiar with the labor protocols , but you should be aware that fraternizing is not permitted during work hours . And do you have a number or maybe a name ? Annika Hansen . And what exactly is your position here ? I 'm the new Efficiency Monitor . Oh , I , uh , didn 't know they 'd hired one . Now that you do , I suggest you return to your station . We weren 't fraternizing . He was just helping me correct an input error . We 're almost finished . Do it quickly . Yes , ma 'am . I thought we were fraternizing . Maybe we could get acquainted after work . Uh , there is a little place some of us like to go to . We could get a meal . I can 't . You need to talk to someone besides your console . I appreciate the offer , but with this new job , I don 't really have time to socialize . They 're always looking for laborers at the Power Distribution Plant . I had a job there once . Didn 't like it much . Odd . They treat their employees well . How long were you there ? Oh , a while . It would be very simple for me to find out . A day . A day ? ! Half a day , actually . Give or take an hour . Not what I 'd call an illustrious career . I don 't belong behind a console pushing buttons . But when I heard some of the workers talking about your place , I knew I had to get a job here . You were terminated , weren 't you ? Yes . Oh ... that 's quite an accomplishment during a labor shortage . What happened ? Oh ... it 's a long story . I like a long story . I had a disagreement with the new Efficiency Monitor . She didn 't think my work was very ... Efficient ? Exactly . Then why should I hire you ? Well ... there 's my natural charm and personality . They 'd be a real asset around a place like this , where you 're trying to attract patrons . I mean , look at you . You haven 't been able to tear yourself away from me . There 's no one else here . Please . I really need the work . You 'd better clean those tables over there . This place is going to be filled with hungry workers as soon as the next shift ends . You won 't regret this . Oh , I 'm certain I will . ... all of them about my father , and he couldn 't understand why I wasn 't insulted . Finally , I just had to tell him : I 'm Norvalian . I don 't have a father . It wasn 't that funny , Tuvok . On the contrary . The man was ignorant of how your species procreates . His attempt to disparage you ultimately humiliated him . Irony is often a source of humor . Yes , well , when you explain it like that , uh ... it 's not funny at all . I also have some humorous anecdotes to share . I 'll look forward to hearing them . I thought you didn 't have time to socialize . I 'm not socializing . I 'm reviewing these manuals and having something to eat . Well , I recommend the Latara broth , and the section on thermal coefficients . I 'll join you . Really , I 'm very , very busy . Well , not to socialize . To , uh , help you review the manuals . How was your first day ? Here you are . Compliments of the proprietress . Tom . Uh , I 'll be right back . The proprietress doesn 't give away drinks . Well , I 'm just creating customer loyalty . You 've been creating loyalty all night with those two women . I suggest you attend to the other tables . Yes , ma 'am . Here you are . Thank you . Looks great . I can 't believe I let you keep me out this late . Well , I thought it was my responsibility to help you study those manuals . Of course . And now that I have , you should be less likely to overload the core . You know , with all this fascinating discussion about thermal coefficients , you never told me where you 're from . A planet called Earth . Never heard of it . Oh , a long way from here . What 's it like ? Overpopulated , polluted , very little work . It sounds like my homeworld . Guess we 're both lucky to be here . It 's nice to be in a place where different species get along so well . Oh , so , you admit we 're getting along . I was speaking in a broader cultural context . I see . There 's a lot of violence where I come from . That 's too bad . It 's getting late . I still haven 't adjusted to the weather here . It gets so cold at night . It 's almost curfew . Yes , sir . We both live right here . Good night , then . You know , one of the advantages of living in employee housing is that we can continue sharing ideas even after the workday is over . Is that so . Yes , and I do have a spectacular view of the river from my living quarters . I really have to get to sleep . Maybe another time . I 'm sorry if I 'm making you uncomfortable . You 're not . Well , if you get lonely ... I 'll let you know . It wasn 't me . It 's not an overload . It 's time for our inoculations . What inoculations ? They 're nothing to worry about . Protection against ambient radiation . I didn 't realize that was a problem . It 's not , as long as you 're inoculated regularly . We 're lucky to have an employer that concerned about our safety . It wasn 't that bad . It doesn 't bother me . How long did it take to go away ? Ten days , two weeks . Is something wrong ? Forgive me , but ... I 'm , I 'm afraid of injections . I assure you , this is painless . Is-is there some other method of administering the medication ? No , I 'm afraid there isn 't . Very well . No ! No ! No ! We 're finished . You can go back to work . Next . First Officer 's Log , Stardate 54584.3 . Ensign Kim , Mr. Neelix and I are returning to Voyager after five days of trading with the Nar Shaddan . In six years , I 've never been on an away mission worse than this one . I don 't know how you can say that . The cargo hold is crammed with valuable supplies . And my stomach is crammed with alien parasites doing back flips . I guess you shouldn 't have drunk that Falah nectar . You insisted I try it . Uh ! The Nar Shaddan consider it a delicacy . To refuse would 've insulted them . I didn 't hear you insisting that Commander Chakotay try it . Commander Chakotay 's a vegetarian . It was made from meat ? More like a meat byproduct . I 'm going to be sick . Not after you drink this . What is it ? Leola bark tea . To settle even the queasiest of stomachs . Ugh ! It smells worse than the meat nectar . I 'll wait for the Doctor to treat me . At least I 'll be sleeping in my own bed tonight . Harry , I know you 're not feeling well , but I need you and Neelix up here . On our way . Anything wrong , Commander ? We 're at the rendezvous coordinates , but there 's no sign of Voyager , and they 're not responding to hails . Start scanning on all frequencies . They 've got to be out there somewhere . So much for my own bed . Reinitialize the subspace transponder . Warning . Main computer is failing . Switch to backup processors . Main computer stabilized . Good . Now ... let 's try this again . Reinitialize the subspace transponder . Unable to comply . Why not ? Insufficient power . And they say I 'm difficult . Reroute power from the replicator system . Unable to comply . Clarify ! Relays to the transponder are fused . Any suggestions ? Please restate inquiry . Can the power relays be bypassed ? Negative . Then I suppose I 'll have to replace them by hand . Warning . Intruder alert . Where ? The Bridge . How many ? Two humanoids . Can you identify them ? Negative . Sensor resolution is below 20 percent . Stop what you 're doing and turn around ! Take it easy , Doc ! It 's us ! It 's good to see some friendly faces . For that matter , it 's good to see any faces at all . I 'm sorry I haven 't gotten life support back on line yet , but since I 've been the only one aboard , it hasn 't been a priority . What the hell happened ? We ran into some ... problems . I can see that . Can you be a little more specific ? Of course . About ... 12 hours after you left on your away mission , things started to go wrong . We hit some sort of subspace mine . Computer , transfer the EMH to the mobile emitter . Sick Bay to Bridge . Sick Bay to Engineering . Please respond . It wasn 't long before I was inundated with casualties , all suffering from tetryon radiation poisoning . Pretty soon , the Captain arrived . Doctor , can you treat these people ? I can stabilize them , but if we can 't contain the radiation ... Get everyone to the escape pods , quickly . Not you , Doctor . I need you here . Captain ? Computer , activate the Emergency Command Hologram . Authorization : Janeway-omega-3 . Command codes transferred . You 've wanted this chance for a long time . Now you 've got it . Aye , Captain . Try to vent the radiation . The rest of us will get out of the contaminated area and head for the nearest habitable planet . You need medical care . Unless someone answers our distress call , we 'll have to make due with medkits . We 'll rendezvous as soon as it 's safe to come back on board . Take good care of Voyager . You can count on me , Captain . The crew abandoned ship , and I began to assess the damage caused by the mine . But before I could even get started with the repairs , I got some unexpected company . Computer , report . An alien vessel has locked onto Voyager with a tractor beam . Open a channel . This is the Federation Starship Voyager . Disengage your tractor beam . Our scans show no life signs aboard your vessel . ldentify yourself . I 'm the Emergency Command Hologram . " Hologram . " That 's right . Now release my ship . Your crew has abandoned it . It belongs to me now . I beg to differ . Computer , target the vessel 's tractor emitter and fire . Come about , heading 903 mark 6 . Engage at warp 2 . Warp engines are off-line . Evasive pattern Beta-4 . Target the vessel 's engines . Warning . Two vessels approaching , bearing 336 mark 1 . Reverse course , full impulse . I managed to evade the other two ships and hid inside this nebula . I vented the radiation , repaired as many systems as I could , but with no help , let 's just say I 'm glad you found me . It wasn 't easy picking up your homing signal . Well , I had to encrypt it . Every time I left the nebula , I detected more ships searching for me . Any idea who they are ? No . But I 've analyzed all of their weapons signatures . They match the subspace mine . It was a deliberate attempt to disable Voyager . Good thing you were here . What about the rest of the crew ? Not a word . Make them comfortable . We 're going to treat your injuries . Who are you ? My name is Dr. Kadan . You 're in a Quarren medical facility . My crew ... ? My understanding is that they 've all been rescued from their escape pods . Treat my people first . Everyone will be taken care of . Thank you . What is that medication ? An antiradiation serum , perfectly safe . What are you doing ? She 's suffering from Dysphoria Syndrome . Don 't worry , it 's treatable . Release her immediately . Restrain him . Captain ! No ! No ! Excuse me . Hi . I believe we know each other . You 're Tuvok , right ? We met last week at the shift briefing . Before that . Before we were working here . Oh , I don 't think so . I mean , we 're obviously not from the same place . Still ... I believe I know you . From the hospital perhaps ? What hospital ? ... I am not certain . We ... We were patients . You must have me confused with someone else . I 've never been sick enough to go to a hospital . I 'm sorry , I have a lot of work to finish . Please ... try to remember . It-It may be important . Is there a problem here ? I think it 's just a misunderstanding . Tuvok ? She 's right . It 's , uh ... it 's a ... It 's a misunderstanding . You don 't look well . Maybe you should go to the infirmary . No , no , I 'm fine . Fine . Uh ... I 'll go back to my station . Sorry to have bothered you . What was that all about ? I 'm not sure . Strange man . And a terrible joke teller . So , are we having dinner tonight ? Again ? What , you don 't like my cooking ? No , it 's wonderful . It 's just ... I 'm a perfectionist . I 'm going to keep trying until I make you the perfect meal . And then we stop eating together ? I 'll have dinner with you . On one condition : I make it . I think I can accept those terms . Good . Now go back to your station before the Efficiency Monitor catches us fraternizing . Can I bring you something else ? No , thank you . I haven 't seen you in here before . You probably just didn 't notice . Oh , I 'd have noticed . Well , apparently , you aren 't as observant as you think you are . Oh , really ? I 've been coming in here the same time every day for the past two weeks . Well , that explains it . I usually work nights . Me , too . At the Power Distribution Facility . You see ? I am observant . Tom ... Hmm ... I need you for a moment . I 'll be right there . Listen , you should come back in when you get a night off . It 's a lot more fun when there 's a crowd . I don 't really like crowds . Well , then , maybe we could get together during the day sometime , take a walk by the river . I don 't think so . Why not ? I am a very engaging conversationalist . Oh . Yeah . Still want to get together ? You 're married . No . Oh . Enjoy your day . First Officer 's Log , Stardate 54597.9 . After restoring primary systems , we 've left the nebula to try to find the crew . Though there 's still a lot of damage , we have been able to reconfigure sensors to detect subspace mines . Ensign Kim 's been running continuous scans , but there 's still no sign of our people . On the bright side , the ships that were searching for us seem to have given up . With only four people on board , repairs are going slowly . Power to the secondary propulsion systems has been restored . Kim to the Doctor . Report to Astrometrics . On my way . Any luck ? I 've scanned ships and planets in 83 systems . No humans , no Vulcans , no Bolians ... Maybe we can increase the range of the sensors by tying them into the main deflector . I 've already done that . Oh . Well , we can boost resolution by ... I appreciate your input , Doc , but I didn 't call you down here to help me scan . I 'm still feeling kind of queasy from that nectar . I treated you days ago . Whatever you did hasn 't worked . Maybe all those command subroutines are compromising your medical abilities . Maybe all that sarcasm is compromising your natural charm . I 've repaired the deuterium injectors , brought secondary propulsion back on line , and soothed Ensign Kim 's upset tummy . Good work . Why don 't you get started on the ruptured plasma conduits on Deck 10 ? Can 't you take care of those ? I beg your pardon ? " Emergency Command Hologram . " Doesn 't that suggest my place is here in Voyager 's command center ? Look , Doc , I 'm impressed with the way you handled yourself while we were gone . But right now , we 've got to prioritize . Kim to Chakotay . Go ahead . I 've found them , Commander . They 're on an M-Class planet . At maximum warp , we can be there in less than three days . Transfer the coordinates to the helm . I 'll be in Astrometrics . Doctor ... the Command Center is yours . Mmm , smells good . It 's only burnt on the outside . Your cooking console 's a little temperamental , huh ? Did you try talking to it ? Once I cut off the charred part , I 'm sure it 'll be fine . Hmm . It 's good . Really ? Let 's go . Where ? I promised you dinner . We 'll just have to get it somewhere else . Wait . I 'm not really hungry . Are you ? No . Let 's stay here . First Officer 's Log , Stardate 54608.6 . We 've traced the crew 's life signs to a large city on a planet called Quarra . Unfortunately , the local officials aren 't being very cooperative . I have personally interviewed several of the individuals on your crew manifest . None of them know who you are , nor have they heard of a Starship Voyager . I 'd like to speak to them myself . That 's not possible . If you 're telling the truth , you have nothing to lose by letting us talk to them . Unlike other planets in this system , we grant our guest workers the full protection of our laws . What exactly are you protecting them from ? Unscrupulous individuals attempting to acquire skilled laborers . We 're not trying to acquire laborers . We 're trying to find our friends . Most of your friends have excellent positions in the Central Power Facility in the capitol . Why would any of them want to travel thousands of light-years to a planet on the other side of the galaxy , when they have safe , comfortable lives right here ? Because it isn 't their home . I suggest you look elsewhere to increase your labor supply . And if you attempt to disturb any of our citizens , we will respond with force . Any luck ? There 's no way to beam them through the shield grid . Take us out of orbit . We 're not leaving them behind . No . But I want these people to think we are . Hope the cooking console 's not being temperamental again . Making a hot drink is one thing I can do . You 're right . It 's good . I told you . Mmm . What 's even better is being here with you . Are you comfortable ? The blanket 's nice and warm . No , I mean here with me . I can 't remember being more comfortable ... in my life . Yeah , I 'll take care of it . Hi . Listen , I get off work in a few minutes . I thought maybe you and I could go to ... You don 't give up , do you ? You don 't even know what I was gonna say . Let me guess . You 're going to invite me to take a walk by the river or maybe to your living quarters to admire the view . Actually ... I was going to offer to introduce you to some people I met . A couple expecting their first baby in a few weeks . I thought you might want to get to know some other parents . You know , swap stories , maybe even find a playmate for your baby . If it 's a bad idea ... No . No , it 's nice . Listen , I 'm sorry about the other day . I 'm the one who should be apologizing . I shouldn 't have assumed ... - Forget it . - Look , it 's rare that I admit I 'm wrong , so you might as well take advantage of it while you can . It 's been hard ... being alone with a baby coming . I have a habit of keeping my guard up . Well , that 's understandable . It 's just ... a romantic relationship is really out of the question for me right now , and when - you started asking ... - How about a friend ? What ? Well , you said romance is out of the question . Could you use a friend ? Any progress ? I 've spoken to the captains of eight vessels that left Quarra in the last two weeks . No one knew anything about the crew ? No . But every one of them asked me if I was looking for employment . Apparently , there 's a severe labor shortage throughout this system . There 's a lot of competition for workers . That ambassador said most of our people were working at the main power facility . I wonder if they still have any positions to fill . I can make some inquiries . Why ? Because you and I are going to find ourselves jobs . Reentering orbit might arouse their suspicion . Not if we take my ship . Good idea , Neelix . Commander , you 've spoken directly with several government officials . You could be recognized . Isn 't reconstructive surgery one of your specialties ? I still say you should 've posed as a Talaxian . We 'd have made a striking pair . Whiskers make me itch . How did it go ? As soon as I told the supervisor our qualifications , he was eager to hire us . He even helped me get a docking permit for my ship . We 'll be gainfully employed by tomorrow morning . Here you go , Doc . Give me your hand , Mr. Neelix . What 's this ? A subdermal transponder . It will allow us to maintain an open com-link so we can transport you through the shield grid if there 's trouble . Hold position at maximum transporter range . Aye , sir . I assumed I 'd be in charge during your absence , Commander . Excuse me ? An Emergency Command Hologram , programmed with over two million tactical subroutines , outranks an Ensign . A few words to the computer , and this Ensign can delete those subroutines . Then you 'd be depriving yourself of a skilled leader for the sake of your ego . Oh , my ego ! Gentlemen ... work it out . Aye , sir . Employee 8583 . Mr. Tuvok . According to my records , you 've neglected to report for your last three inoculations . These inoculations are for your protection . A sick worker is not an efficient worker . Report to the infirmary . Seven of Nine . What ? Seven of Nine . It 's ... your designation . My employee number is 8586 . Take your hands off me ! Call Security ! I don 't believe you are who you think you are ! We don 't belong here . We don 't belong here ! This isn 't right ! We don 't belong here ! Qualification Level 3 in microkinetics . You could use some improvement there . Level 5 in thermionic conversion . Good . We lost a thermionic specialist yesterday . Did he find a better job ? Uh , health problems . Someone you know ? No , just ... an unusual species . We have a diverse workforce . Our thermionic converters operate on a rotating frequency , so they have to be closely monitored . You 'll be required to report your readings to the Controller at regular intervals . Any questions ? Are you listening to me ? Sorry , sir . I 'm just excited to be here . Carry on . Kathryn . Yes . It 's Chakotay . I 'm sorry ? I 'm new here . The supervisor said you would be a good person to speak to if I had any questions . Mm . What can I help you with ? Nothing . I just wanted to introduce myself . Oh , what did you say your name was ? Chakotay . Actually , that 's just what my friends call me . My employment file lists my given name : Amal Kotay . Well , whatever your name is , I 'm happy to help you any way I can . No , no ! You 're experiencing a relapse of Dysphoria Syndrome . This is going to make you feel better . Get away from me ! Losing my job there was the best thing that ever happened to me . Why is that ? Well , so many rules and regulations . It was like a military operation . I know what you mean . " Report here , reroute power there . " It 's almost like serving aboard a starship . Have you ever done that ? You 're looking at the former captain of his own cargo vessel . Hmm , must be quite a life . What about you ? Ever worked on a ship ? Oh , no . Space travel makes me sick . I 'm not lying . So , do you know most of the people that come in here ? A lot of them . This is a great place to work . Seems like it . I could put in a good word for you to my employer . Ah , Neelix . I was wondering when you 'd get here . Amal Kotay , this is my new friend , Tom Paris . What can I get you ? That looks good . I was assigned to the primary fusion chamber along with Mulcahey and Celes . Neither of them recognized me . Let me guess . They really love their jobs . It 's like they 've all been programmed to be happy here . It 's a safe bet they 're not going - to leave willingly . - Here you go . Hi . How was your first day ? Not bad . Would you and your friend like to join us ? That would be nice . Um , actually , I was hoping we could eat alone tonight . Maybe another time . That was rude . I 'm sorry . I just , um ... There 's something I 'd like to talk to you about . Thanks . - Bye-bye . - Thank you for joining us . B 'Elanna . I 'm due for a break . I 'll walk you to the transport . Stop worrying . I 'll be fine . It 's not you that I 'm worried about . The baby will be fine , too . So , what I was thinking is if we were to combine our resources , we would reduce our expenses . Are you asking me to move in ? Yes . I know it 's impulsive . I ... know we haven 't known each other very long , but ... things are so easy when we 're together . And I just thought I ... Okay . What ? Maybe I 'm out of my mind but let 's try it . I think this is gonna be a lot of fun , don 't you ? It 's gonna be great . You 'll see . Yeah . Yeah , they 're waiting for us . Come on , we got to go , all right ? Oh , excuse me . It was my fault . I should watch where I 'm going . B 'Elanna ? How do you know my name ? What if I told you we were old friends ? That 's a ridiculous statement . I know it sounds strange , but I can prove it to you . Look , I 'm sorry , but I 'm late for work . Let go of me ! I 'm not going to hurt you . - Security , help . - Chakotay to Voyager . We 've got B 'Elanna . Lock on to Neelix 's signal , and transport them to Sick Bay . Acknowledged . Help me ! Let her go ! Stop ! Harry , I need an emergency transport now ! Sorry , Commander , we 're under attack . I had to raise shields . No , leave me alone ! We 're friends . We 're trying to help you . No , don 't touch me ! He turned into the accessway . I 'll call for reinforcements . I think he went in there ! Be careful ! He might be armed !

 Crais , come in . This is Aeryn . Pilot , there 's no answer from Crais . Nor is Moya getting any answer from Talyn . Aeryn , what can you see ? He 's been hit hard . Crais . Where 's Talyn ? I can barely sense him . He is alive , but unresponsive . Moya is supplying nutrients . Talyn destroyed one Prowler but their attack was merely a diversion . Peacekeepers ... They want Talyn back . A Vigilante with an immobilizer pulse . What attacked Talyn was a Retrieval Squad . You do know , John , that if we can revive Talyn , we have to Starburst away immediately and we can 't go back . There is something I deeply wish to share with you . Wake up , Aeryn . I 'm your mother . I came to tell you something . You were conceived in love . Our love . We wanted you . My mother . Yes . The Retrieval Squad . She is somehow part of it . The Squad is under the command of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun . They 're out of the bionisphere and Moya 's sensing a Peacekeeper scan . Talyn , Starburst immediately . Talyn 's done it . He 's escaped . There will be no contact with Moya until the threat of the Retrieval Squad is resolved . They are hoping that my mother 's presence will divide my loyalties . But I will not let them get Talyn back . Even if it means I have to kill her . And now on Farscape ... Kama-nak , kama-nak , kama-nak ... Kama-nak , kama-nak , kama-nak ... Kama-nak , kama-nak , kama-nak ... Rygel ! Oh ... I may be small , but allow me to remind you : that only serves to put me at castration level ! With them on the other side of this very thin bulkhead . A bit noisy , were they ? She was bad enough , but Crichton ! He was louder than she was . He actually sounded like he was exerting himself . What kind of a male is he anyway ? Oh , they 're between bouts . Give them a few microts . Hang on . There 's another ! Oh , God . You were louder than that , believe it or not . How much longer ? How much longer what ? Does Talyn have to stay on board this planet ? Oh well , the heavy gravity 's letting him sleep . Mm-hmm . Stark said the vegetation has restorative power , so it 's our one ... Hmm ? quick-stop chance to get him back to full fighting strength . I suggest you all get up here immediately . Talyn 's senses have picked up another ship entering the planet 's atmosphere . Dangerously close . Damn . Friend or foe ? Friend or foe ? Friend or .. Talyn 's laboring to discern that . If it 's a Retrieval Squad , are we going to be able to blast our way out of here ? Talyn has powered down to stasis level on all systems to facilitating the recuperation process . We all agreed to take that chance . So your answer is no . We can 't move . Friend or foe ? Friend or ... - Will you shut the frell up ! Of course it 's a foe ! We have no friends ! Talk to us . What do you got ? Talyn has identified it as the Vigilante , the Peacekeeper ship pursuing us . We 've got to do something . There 's nothing we can do . Crichton , you always have a plan . Or sometimes . How close ? - It has just landed . It 's your mother who 's running the frelling Retrieval Squad . Maybe we can use that . Yo ! Not now , Rygel . Not now ? ! They 're here , Crichton , on the planet . They 're going to be knocking down that door at any microt . And our ship is sound asleep . Xhalax . Heavy gravity . Two ... two and a half times what my species is used to . How is your wound ? I will earn my share . Good news . Your shares have just increased . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Decoys ? This is an awfully big ship . You really , really , really think the three of you ... Stark , if you have any other ideas , we 'll be thrilled to hear ' em before we go out . The Peacekeeper ship set down some distance from here . Clearly the planet 's vegetation is masking Talyn 's whereabouts , as we were hoping . That 's not gonna last forever . We 've gotta get these guys away from Talyn , give him a chance to recuperate . Then we got a shot . Maybe . Talyn 's restoration is nearly complete . We need only buy him a little more time . What about me ? Hmm ? What about me ? Why can 't I go out ? I agree . I am the logical choice to stay here with Talyn . Logical , yes . But it ain 't gonna happen , boys . Listen to me . They 're here to take Talyn . We can 't let them anywhere near him when he 's vulnerable like this . Crichton , Crais and I will go down . You will stay here and keep him calm . Wake up , Aeryn . Ahh ! I 've been watching this . The night your mother came and saw you . - My name is Xhalax Sun . I 'm your mother . - Rygel ! What are you doing ? ! She sounds like she likes you . Maybe we can use that to ... This is Aeryn 's stuff . Keep your hands off and your nose out of other people 's business . Well , er , what are we supposed to do when you 're out there and dear old mother comes blasting in ? Buckwheat , we 're going to keep the Retrieval Squad away and you 're going to keep your hands off Aeryn 's stuff . Is that clear ? I don 't give a ropey dren about heavy gravity . Our targets are near . Keep moving . How many missions have you been on ? Six . Nine . Nine and out , right ? This is your last mission as a mercenary . You complete this one and you can buy your freedom . You have a mate ? Offspring ? Yes . - Nice . It 'd be a frelling shame if you and your mate here screwed up and you were to start your mission count back at zero . So frell the gravity . Cinch up your mivonks and keep moving . Pulse Rifles . Definitely Peacekeeper . This way . What the hell 's wrong with this gun ? I don 't know . Maybe chakan mist is ruining the pulse deploy . Well , they 're either after us or not . We 've left a trail Stevie Wonder could follow . Oh , wow . Wait . What ? Oarusk fruit . Remind me not to put that on my Cocoa Puffs . Oh , stop that incessant humming . When you stop that hiccuping . I hiccup when I 'm nervous . Well , I hum when I 'm nervous . A hiccup is involuntary you pellish venker ! Humming isn 't ! Rygel . What ? Vines from outside growing inside . Fresh trail , that way ! Indigenous ? No . Sebacean . Okay , welcome to the butthole of the universe . Very close . Three point vector . Are you up to this ? We are ready . This can 't be good . It can 't be bad . It 's the same vegetation that 's helping to heal Talyn . It 's rooted to the planet . How 's Talyn supposed to take off with this stuff laced through him ? Once Talyn 's back to full strength , I 'm sure he 'll be able to tear himself away . Easily . Come on . Pull ! How far have we gone ? Not quite one full metra . One more metra , we should circle back . Right . Oh ... What you got ? That way . There ! Cover me . Aeryn ? ! John ? Aeryn ? ! John . Damn . Move and you die . Where is he ? Are you Xhalax ... Are you Xhalax Sun ? Where is he ? Stop ! Nice to see you again , Mother . Aeryn ? ! Aeryn ? - Crichton ! Crichton ! - Stop making noise or they 'll find us . I 've been hit . Oh hell , that 's ugly . I got to find Aeryn . Crichton , don 't you leave me here . The Retrieval Squad . They are using Colartas . They 're using what ? Expert trackers . You leave me here bleeding , they will find me and kill me . And ? Are you shot ? No . The gravity . One of my hearts , it has burst . Can you move ? Won 't slow you down . I can still track . Have you seen Xhalax ? No . I can locate her . No . But she might be wounded . We pursue and retrieve our target . That is our mission . We don 't get paid for finding Xhalax . Move . What are you doing ? - You want to bleed to death ? What do you think ? - Then shut up . This might sting a little . Okay , maybe more than a little . This should slow the bleeding . Stop any bone from working its way out , at least temporarily . You knew who I was . Who are you ? I 'm Aeryn . Aeryn Sun . I 'm your daughter . If you are my daughter , you are a Peacekeeper . I 'm not a Peacekeeper anymore . Then you are with Crais . Where the hezmana have you been ? - On the bridge . Comfortable up there ? - Listen ... 'Cause while you 've been frotzing around , I 've been trying to keep this dren from taking over ... Rygel , shut up ! Talyn , he 's almost healed . What ? Completely ? It 's a ... yes ... Well , can we blast ourselves free of this yotz ? Soon . If ... if we can keep these under control , then I think Talyn will be strong enough to break free . But what if the others aren 't back by then ? They 're up against a Peacekeeper Retrieval Squad out there . Don 't delude yourself , fahrbot . They 're probably never coming back . What do you smell ? Two of them . One is unknown to me . The other is a ... a Sebacean . Wounded . At least with this gravity , the Colartas will be in more trouble than ... we are . That 's a comfort . Get up . Get up ! We got to get out of here . Aeryn had the positioning device . So she 'll be able to find her way back to Talyn . If she 's still alive . She is still alive . She is alive . Where are you taking me ? Back to the gunship . Which I named Talyn , by the way . Yes , I thought you 'd find that amusing . Naming it after Daddy ? It 's not amusing . It 's sentimental and weak . Is that why you 're sparing me ? Because I 'm your Mummy ? No . Because with that wound , out here , you will die . Alive , you 're potential leverage . Regulation Field Op Procedure insists you terminate all hostile personnel on point of contact . Eliminate the threat . And when I 'm dead , you can name your Prowler after me . Oh yes , that 's very funny . Well , I no long follow Regulation Field Op Procedures , and I know it 's not by chance that you ended up out here on this assignment . High Command knew I was out here with Talyn and Crais . They probably thought , " Send her mother . " Or perhaps you even volunteered for the pleasure . Did you ? Thought , you know , things go wrong , we end up face to face , perhaps the daughter will flinch . I 'm not flinching . We have no idea where we are going . We could be going around in circles . We 're not going in circles , nimrod , because we 've never been here before . We 're completely lost . Oh , God ! I hate mazes . Oh , my first girlfriend , Julie , she loved ' em . Oh , boy , did she . " Hey , Johnny , let 's go in the mirror maze together , huh ? " Hey , Jules ! Is this makin you horny ? Our size and weight will give us a slight advantage over the Colartas . But our sweat and blood will continue to lead them right to us . Shut up . - You shut up . No , you shut up . I 've got an idea . What are you doing ? Here , smell that . Oh ! Oh ! Geez ! If this doesn 't cover our scent , or kill us , I don 't know what will . Camol ! Yep , that 's good . There you go . Spread it around . Don 't forget to cover your private bits . How much ... longer ... till Talyn is fully healed ? Look , I 'm still not sure we should leave . But ... We 're leaving . Soon as Talyn 's ready we 're leaving whether they 're here or not . You got that ? Rygel , the hero . Aeryn , I always knew you 'd make it back . The others aren 't as capable as you . Not as strong . Not nearly ... - Shut up . Ah ... this ... this is your mother ? Aren 't you going to introduce us ? No . What 's the news on Crichton and Crais ? No news . You 're the first back . Hmm , no scent . How is that possible ? Body heat . This way . Here . Crais . Crais ! All right , come on , John . Come on , man . Concentrate . Find Aeryn , get the hell out of here alive . Oh , poor baby . Poor , poor , Johnny . Now is not a good time , Scorpy . Go away . On the contrary . You summoned me . You know what ? You are really becoming annoying . Go away ! But your subconscious did and that 's where I reside , remember ? This point . It needs to be sharp , but not so spindly that it is weak . As long as you 're here . These pina colada things chasing us . Are they everything Crais has cracked them up to be ? Oh , yes . In that , at least , Crais has been completely forthright . Where has he not been forthright ? As far as I could tell , Talyn 's systems are almost back to normal . Then it 's time to wake him up and get aloft . We use Talyn 's senses to locate Crichton and Crais . Talyn , activate the intruder ... Let us out of here , you snarking dellot ! Let us out ! Ah , you murderous little beast . You 're going to be dead meat . Dead meat , dead meat , dead meat . Oh , you really do have three stomachs . And the smallest little heart I 've ever seen . Help ... me . Please , Stark . Help ... me . This is a remarkable vessel . High Command could never have anticipated that their hybrid genetic would evolve so successfully . What are you doing ? Can 't fire the ship up while he still has the capacity for independent thought . You 're severing his higher functions ? After which , I can fly him home manually . Techs are standing by to bring him back to life , once he 's got a Control Collar on . Talyn is not like other Leviathans . He will die before accepting a Control Collar . My mission is to subdue the Leviathan hybrid for easy transport . Then track and deliver the second target . Captains are the elite . The most trusted jarheads in all the Peacekeeper ranks . 'Cause , you make Captain , you 're on the A-list , for all the top parties , all the heavy-duty crap that the Peacekeepers sure as hell don 't want floating free in the universe . Crichton , listen to me . You know , I always wondered why a swinging cat like you would be way out here in the boondocks . Why you wanted so bad to be Talyn 's prom date and then suddenly ... it all came very clear to me . You need us . You knew we wouldn 't lift a finger to help you , but we would do anything to protect Talyn . The Peacekeepers , they 're not only after Talyn , they 're after you . From the moment you set foot on Moya , you knew that this day was coming . And you kept us as allies when they came gunning ' . That 's not true . That 's not the only reason I wanted help you . Crichton , you can 't leave me here like this . Yes , I can . What are you going to do ? If you 're what the Retrieval Squad wants , brother , this is their lucky day . Hey , boys ! Can you smell him now ? ! Oh , pina coladas ! - Crichton ! No ! Come back ! Crichton ! Crichton ! Even in his dormant state , he still struggles against me . Don 't do this . He won 't struggle when I 've finished crippling him . My entire life , on every assignment , every transport ship , I scanned the soldiers , looking for a face I 'd only ever seen once . And now finally seeing you , I feel nothing but shame . Officer Sun , do you actually believe I care what you think ? Your sentiment disgusts me . I have not wasted a microt of my life thinking about you . You 're ashamed of me ? You , a traitor ? An enemy to everything you were bred for ? The Peacekeepers made me the enemy that I am . Look at what you are doing . You are butchering this magnificent creature in its sleep . When it wakes , it will be a slave and there is no guarantee it will survive the procedure . You are pathetic . You are not my daughter . I am . You made me very aware of that the night you came to me when I was a child and you told me what you 'd done . Which , may I remind you , was not regulation . I never came to you . You only dreamt it . Oh well , for many cycles I believed that . But you see , I now have a vid recording , which I would be happy to show you if you 'd like to see it . Or are you ashamed of your sentiment ? Yes I am , and I paid for it . My superior officers knew I visited you that night . They interrogated me and I professed my ... attraction for a certain Peacekeeper officer . My father . Yes . Talyn . He was older than I was . No longer as effective in battle . But my superiors didn 't want to lose me . So , they gave me a chance to redeem myself . What did you do to redeem yourself ? How did you redeem yourself ? By killing your father . I found the scent again . Ah ... At last . Wait . This could be a trap . The other might still be near . Do you smell him ? No . Captain Bialar Crais . Or should I say , former Captain Crais ? Do you have any idea how many Inquisitors want you back in High Command ? Our orders are to take you in alive , but half alive is still ... Wait ! There 's ... I smell something . Yes . Hey , hey , Crais ! Couldn 't have done it without ya . Why didn 't you tell me ? Needed your fear , homeboy . I needed the sweat . I 've served my purpose as your lure . Now untie me . You don 't get it , do you ? Ain 't no way , son . You stuck the knife in one time too many . What , are you just going to leave me like this ? Well , you earned it . If you 're going to execute me , execute me . Kill me . But don 't leave me here to die ! You lied to us ! You betrayed us and you used us ! I used all my assets to stay alive , and those assets were you . You think of your own survival now . What if Aeryn is dead ? She 's not . What if she is ? How are you going to command Talyn ? How are you going to get off this planet without me ? And what if Aeryn isn 't back at Talyn when you get there ? What are you going to do then ? What about Rygel . Is he dead ? He died for several microts , but I managed to get his little heart beating again . Then I sewed the wound closed with the vines . The restorative vines . But ... I 'm no diagnosan . I don 't know what else to do . She doesn 't know it yet , but Talyn is almost recovered . All we have to do is wait till he wakes up . He 's not going to wake up . Aeryn . Wake up , Aeryn . Aeryn ... My name is Xhalax Sun . The night you 've so conveniently forgotten . I 'm your mother . You mustn 't reveal to anyone that I was here . Do you understand ? I came to tell you something . Aeryn , your life was not an accident . You cared enough then to risk everything , to meet the child that you had conceived . You can 't have burned that love away completely . Talyn , that 's your father 's name . He and I chose to have you . You were conceived in love . Our love . I am that child . I am part of you . I am part of Talyn . I wanted you to know this . Peacekeeper way isn 't the only way . It 's not too late for you . It makes you special . We wanted you . No ! This is dead history ! Your father is dead ! And you ... you will face a Peacekeeper Tribunal , on a charge of high treason . Rygel ! I 've been filleted . The restorative vines . They 're working ! Rygel , come over here now and untie us ! Get over there ? I need bed rest for at least the next 50 arns ! Oh ! Oh ! Have you seen these so-called stitches ? Who did this to me ? I did . Oh , great . A one-eyed hingmot with no 3-D vision . Oh ! Oh ! How many of my vital organs did you puncture ? ! I saved your life ! Saved my life ! Look ! You sewed this to me ! Rygel ... My robes ! You sewed my robes to my chest ! Get over here , now ! Is this thing working ? It had better be . We 'll never find Talyn without it . Oh , for frell 's sake , Rygel . Use two hands . Two hands . I 'm going as fast as I can ! My robes are stitched inside my chest cavity . You are so ungrateful . And I 'm trying to keep my guts from spilling out all over this frelling floor ! Right . See if you can wake Talyn . If he 's up to it , when I get back , we 're going . Come on . Come on ! C - come on ! We 've been here . That 's old faithful . We must be near Talyn . Aeryn ? I would take you back , attempt to redeem you if it was possible . But your corruption is too advanced ! My corruption began the moment I was conceived ! No ! Watch the teeth ! Don 't you see my independence comes from you anyway ? I grew up wanting to be just like a woman I 'd only seen once . You are a traitor ! I am the part of you that wanted to be a rebel , the part of you that knew deep down inside what was right . - Shut up ! You 've resisted Peacekeeper doctrine before . Shut up ! Why can 't you do it again now ? You are an aberration ! I am your child ! Right , John , get out of the way . Let her do it . Let her shoot me ! No , Aeryn , don 't kill her ! We have to . - You can 't . There 's been too much killing ! No . We let her live , she comes , she hunts us down again . Aeryn , you should not be the one to do this ! She can 't do it ! She 's afraid . Aeryn , please . Put the gun away . You 're wrong . Aeryn is right . We must not let Xhalax live . Officer Sun knows Peacekeeper regulations . If we don 't kill Xhalax , she will come after us again . Aeryn is not going to be the one to kill her mother ! You want her dead ? Fine , you do it ! As you wish . Somebody must do it . Go . Go now . You must not witness this . Coward ! She can 't kill me . I am right , aren 't I ? We let you live , you come and you find us again . What , do you expect me to lie ? To beg for my life ? Crais is right . I will hunt you down and I will kill you . Goodbye , Mother . Aeryn , you have to go . Go on . Do it . Do it . No . Your recovery is truly a miracle . If I don 't die of hekpus from these threads in my chest ! Don 't move ! Let me see ! That 's done it . Does it look all right ? You 're ... you 're as handsome as you ever were . And , all things considered , you know , Rygel , you 're lucky just to be alive again . Alive again ? Yes . For a while there , you were dead . No ! Yes . And when I joined with you , to bring you back , I met with Zhaan . Zhaan ? Yes . That 's why you stitched the frelling tunic to my chest . You were busy hallucinating . She looked contented . She whispered to me . Kala ... Kalash atir ... Kalash atir maz . What ? It is a prayer of guardianship . It means she is watching over us . Kala ... Kalash atir ... Kalash atir maz . Mmm . How is he ? Crais is attempting to splice his neural engrams with Talyn 's . And if he can , then Talyn will be able to navigate on his own once again and we can get some sleep . Or not . You don 't have to wait up for me if you don 't want to . No , I don 't mind . It is all we can do . Yeah . It 's just a large part of Crais 's psyche will now reside in Talyn . It 's the only way to bring Talyn back to life . My ... Xhalax was my last connection to the Peacekeepers . All my ties to them are now completely severed . I know .

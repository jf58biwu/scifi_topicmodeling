 It doesn 't have to be this way . Just listen to reason . I have no use for reason ... puny human ! The Selbachian ship is almost within range . And this vessel shall be the instrument of my revenge . Turn your weapon systems over to me now , or I will kill one of your crew every 2.5 Earth minutes , beginning with the female . Commander ? It 's going to be all right . All stations secure from general quarters . A pleasure working with you , Yeoman . As always . We 're talking about a piece of television history . The actual Spaceforce microprobe Commander Artemis Bishop used to subdue the alien Gorth in the season 2 finale of Astro Quest . And it can all be yours for just $ 750 . 750 ? Do I look like an idiot to you ? That 's nice ! Welcome , Whatifitconners . A special encore presentation of Astro Quest : Redux will begin in Room 21-B in just a few minutes . Nice uniform . Wendy ? You 're Yeoman Malloy . You have a microprobe . I can 't believe this . You 're a Questor ? I think Astro Quest is the greatest science fiction show of all time . I 'm a Commander Bishop fan myself . Who isn 't ? Why Malloy ? I loved her . I mean , I know that she was completely underwritten , but she was the only female biochemist on TV and I liked her spunk . Do you think that , um , I got the collar right ? 'Cause I think on the show that it might 've been a little more , um , swoopy . You ... It looks perfect . Thanks . Can I see that ? Wow ... That 's great . Jihw-CHOK chom-CHEM jag-eej BRYCE cichoki . I don 't speak Vellikon . What did you say ? Security to Room 21-B immediately . Oh , my God , Jon ? Security , 21-B immediately ... Jon ? ! We need medical personnel in 21-B . Jon ? ! Medical personnel in 21-B . Jon ? Jon ? Wake up ! What is the matter with you ? Oh , my God . Speak to me ! Jon ? Jon ? Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Wake up ! Wake up ! Please , everyone stay calm and stay back . We 're with the Crime Lab . Ma 'am , don 't touch anything . Don 't ... Jon ! Please , come with me . Jon . Come with me . Come with me . Brass . Yeah , it 's Hodges . Who ? From Trace , we have a situation at the Whatifitcon . The Whatifit-what ? How 'd you get this number ? I cloned Grissom 's cell phone on a work-related matter . That 's not important now . We have a situation . It 's one of the exhibitors . Could you be more specific ? He 's dead , Jim . - = = ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ ° ÇãÇé · îÏ × = = - ± ¾ × ÖÄ " ½ ö ¹ © Ñ § Ï ° ½ " Á ÷ £ ¬ ÑÏ ½ ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ ¾ - = ÆÆÀÃÐÜ × ÖÄ " × é = - · ­ Òë £ ºID Ð £ ¶ Ô £ ºID Ê ± ¼ äÖá £ ºno3water Jonathan Danson , 36 , from Chowchilla , California . About 42 bucks and a couple of credit cards . So , it probably wasn 't a robbery . Bloody nose , scratches on the face . This guy 's been in a fight or something . You know , if there was a struggle it 'd be really hard to tell on a set like this . Liver temp was 89.7 degrees . He probably died between midnight and 3 : 00 a.m. So , between then and now there 's probably been a few thousand people with access to this booth . You 're going to need a lot of tape lifts . And swabs . Or ... I could run a vacuum cleaner over the whole scene , get exemplars from all these folks and keep you two knuckleheads busy for the next few months . How 'd that be ? Hmm ? Do me a favor beam yourselves back to the lab and let us do our job , please . Okay . Thank you . Nice outfit . I just can 't believe it . I mean , this-this project was Jonathan 's dream . We were so close . So close to what ? He spent five years on this pilot . It 's a remake of the original Astro Quest . An executive from Paramount approached us about it - turning it into a full-on series for the CW . Oh , yeah , really ? No kidding . " Produced by Jonathan Danson and Melinda Carver . " So , do you have a financial interest in the project ? Well , yeah , I financed it . So , what happens to the rights with Jonathan out of the picture ? They revert to me , I guess . What are you getting at ? Exactly what you think I am . A guy in a red shirt dies at the beginning of most Astro Quest episodes . I remember . Come on in . Thanks . Take a look . Perimortem bruise on the neck . And a ... right-angled laceration at the base of the nostrils . The skin appears to be split , not cut . There 's metallic trace in the wound . You and Wendy always go to Whatifitcon together ? Actually , it was our first . Pleasure working with you , Yeoman . As always . Tell me something , Commander . Were you scared ? I wasn 't before . But I am now . But you 're my commanding officer . I 'm also a man . With a man 's needs . If you only knew how many nights I lay awake dreaming of a moment like this . Oh ... I can guess . Hodges , you forgot this . GCMS , chop-chop . My name is Jonathan Danson , and I 'm here to set you free . Free from a vision of an antiseptic future filled with ... with heroes and heroines who are always steadfast and well-adjusted and altruistic . When was this taken ? Last night , special preview event . Anything interesting happens at a sci-fi convention , it 's online somewhere about five seconds later . Like most of you , I grew up with Astro Quest . Every Thursday night my dad would gather the family around our TV to watch the latest episode . I loved it . But the older I got , the more the mythology began to eat away at my soul . I couldn 't measure up to the brave crew of that perfect ship . I wasn 't handsome , courageous , strong . I was weak , petty , self-destructive . And I hated myself for it . But then ... One night ... it hit me like a ... like a bolt of lightning . I looked around the bar at the other frightened , sad people and I ... and I said to myself , " Do you see an Artemis Bishop here ? " " Do you see one at work ? " What 's this ? He 's showing Redux . Uh , in your apartment building or on the street ? People , look around you . Do you see an Artemis Bishop anywhere ? Of course not . Because he 's a fictional construct . A phantom who whispers , " You are not enough . " Well , I am here to show you who we really are . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you ... Astro Quest : Redux . I swear to God I 'm gonna do her ! Garth , you know me . Just stand down . I don 't know anytytything anymore ! I 'm gonna do her . I swear I 'm gonna do her ! Commander ... Okay , Sally , everything 's gonna be all right . Nothing 's ever gonna be all right again ! Do you see that ? ! And now , you 're gonna do what I want , too . You suck . You don 't have the ... Do you get it ? We 're not gonna watch that crap ! Get outta here ! So let me get this straight . Some nerd takes a cheesy , ' 60s sci-fi show and turns it into something a little bit more realistic - minus the spaceship , of course - and the other nerds get pissed off enough that they beat him up and kill him over it ? Well ... people don 't like it when you mess with their heroes . You got something , Riley ? Hmm ... No sign of blood . I doubt it 's the murder weapon . Are we going to have to figure out how many Dumpsters 3,000 people can fill in three days ? Boy , I hope not . Whoa . I got a ... whole lot of geek love on the command chair . Isn 't that nice for them ? I just found A / V central . DVD player , sound gear . And the vic 's laptop . There 's a DVD in the player . According to Article 13 of the Planetary Alliance Charter , we find Jonathan Danson guilty of high treason . This wasn 't part of the presentation . And the penalty is ... Please ! No ! I 'm sorry ! I won 't ever do it again ! Don 't kill me , please ! I got to start watching this show . Sic Semper Tradi torae . Death to traitors . Yeah ? Uh , Catherine , um , hypothetically , if I knew of someone in the lab having a relationship ... What kind of a relationship ? Um ... personal . Affectionate . Romantic ? Okay . Um , hypothetically , if I knew of someone in the lab having a romantic relationship would I be obligated to report them ? Yes . To Ecklie . And , hypothetically , would they suffer consequences ? Are they hypothetically on the same shift ? Yes . Supervisor-subordinate ? No . Well , one of them would have to change shifts , but other than that , they should be fine . Just tell them to report it to Ecklie and to go for it . Life 's too short , right ? So what 's a college professor doing taping the debut of Astro Quest : Redux in a science fiction convention ? I was there with my crew . I 'm making a documentary on the gestalt constructs of sci-fi mytho-cultures . Really ? Have a seat . Thank you . I wanted to talk to you about your video . The crowd didn 't seem to like Danson 's new take on their old mythology . Danson was a provocateur . I actually loved his boldness . But he was playing with fire . You believe one of these people killed him ? Would you believe it ? To its fans , Astro Quest is more than just a television show . It 's a religion . When he screened his Redux , that was the sci-fi equivalent of Martin Luther nailing his " 95 Theses " to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg . That 's keeping it in perspective . People kill each other all the time over belief systems , Mr. Sanders . Or perhaps you 're not familiar with the Middle East . C.O.D. was cerebral hemorrhage due to blunt-force trauma . Sharp blow to the nasal bone snapped the nasofrontal suture , driving it into the frontal sinus , where a secondary fracture penetrated the frontal lobe . Instant unconsciousness . He was dead within minutes . Any idea what hit him ? Something angular , silver-colored . We haven 't found the murder weapon yet . Uh , David , would you finish stitching him up , please ? I 'm not a seamstress . I 'm a coroner 's investigator , damn it . He 's been doing that all day . He 's riffing Corpsman Scully 's one-liners from Astro Quest . Didn 't watch it much . Because you 're not a couch potato . You 're a medical examiner , damn it . Well , he was obviously in some kind of struggle . What do you make of this contusion here ? It 's on a pressure point . Maybe someone attempted a sleeper hold . You mean like a Sethlan submission claw ? That 's real ? Well , you tell me . Ah ! Okay ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! There was something odd in the stomach contents . Take a whiff . Alcohol . Cura ? o , maybe . What are these , um , vermiform chunks of meat ? Those are Vellikon skullworms , which would of course explain the Tijillian ale . It 's Astro Quest food . Some of the bars and restaurants around the convention do that sort of stuff for the conventioneers . That hurt . Good . His name is Jonathan Danson . You recognize him ? Yeah . Yeah , he was in here that night . And he wasn 't a happy camper . He 'd been alone at the bar knocking back drinks when this Astro Quest girl comes up . Yeah , another Vapor , please . He started jocking her pretty hard . No , thank you . No ? Could you please let go of me now ? Please . Her friends didn 't like that . Sir , you just need to let go of my commander . Everything will be okay . Sir , please . Let go ! Just let go ! Hey , stop that ! You have no respect ! Get him ! First off , we abhor violence . That 's the first thing wrong with your entire show ! Yeah , now - see how it feels ? I 'm not down with violence . So I put an end to it . Any of those people in these photos ? Yeah , these three right here . You didn 't happen to get any names , did you ? No . Sorry . After the fight they all split . Well , there 's nothing worse than a bunch of drunk conventioneers . Must be hard enough to sling drinks without making you play dress-up . How do you like this makeup ? Got it on my second tour of Afghanistan . These Astro Questors , they believe in a future where human beings , they transcend their differences . I wouldn 't mind living in a world like that . Yeah , me either . You better be careful . That thing gave me a nasty little shock . Well , of course it did . This is the ... Compliance yoke from " The Slavers of Sirenodon . " It 's a classic . I know , right ? So , the commander and his crew are basically forced into hard labor , right ? By the planet 's ... disembodied rulers . Disembodied , yeah . And they make everybody wear one of these things around their necks . Yeah , and if they don 't follow orders , then they get zapped with this paralyzing pain . Hey ! Hodges ! You don 't have gloves on . It hasn 't been processed . Sorry . Don 't make me use this . What , if anything else , did you do growing up ? Sneer if you wish , but science fiction has been the inspiration for many great technological breakthroughs . I 'm not knocking it . I love sci-fi . You know , specially that talking horse show . That was one of my favorites . Mr. Ed ? Yeah . Yeah . That 's not science fiction . Sure , it is . It postulates an alternate universe in which horses evolve a larynx . No . See , that 's fantasy . No , fantasy is anything that travels faster than the speed of light , Hodges . Which is why if Albert Einstein were alive today , he 'd slap your face . I wasn 't born to be a slave . Is this what we 're supposed to do for the rest of our lives ? Yes . The supervisors assign us the tasks we are to perform . Yours is to collect carbonite rocks . Mine is to ensure that you collect carbonite rocks . I 'm sick of picking up rocks ! Rest if you wish . What I wish ... is to be free . On my planet we choose where we go , what to do , who to love . What is ... love ? On my planet , love is the single most important thing that can happen between sentient beings . Oh , you mean mating . When the time comes to increase the staff , my supervisor will approve a mate for me . Wouldn 't you like to choose your own mate ? Wouldn 't you like that ? Such talk is not permitted in the workplace . Wouldn 't you like ... just once ... to choose for yourself ? No ! No ! Catherine said it would be all right . That Ecklie wouldn 't have any problem with it . Hey , Hodges . No ! Hodges ! Yes ? I got work hits off both sets of those prints from that DVD , and they are locals . Well , sort of . They 're from Pahrump . How do you do , ma 'am ? I 'm Detective Jim Brass , Las Vegas Police . We 're looking for Lionel Rose and Steuben Lorenz . They 're upstairs . Where else ? Identification ? Mom , not now . I told you we 're debriefing . Red alert . Yeah , we made it . It was a joke . Of course , humor is subjective . So , when Jonathan Danson found you sabotaging his life 's work , did he subjectively kick your ass ? Hey ! What the hell are you guys doing here ? What ... Don 't touch that ! No , no , that 's not true . He kicked our asses before , at the bar . You see , I adopted a Gandhi-esque strategy of passive resistance to force the aggressor to recognize the immorality of his actions , while Lionel attempted to avoid confrontation like an inferior male baboon who presents his rump for the dominant male to mount . Unfortunately ... Danson proved ignorant of baboon body language . We-we didn 't even go to the convention hall that night . We sent her : Risa . Risa Parvess . P - A-R-V-E-S-S . I didn 't think it was a good idea . I mean , she 's always been really unstable . Did you deliver the payload ? Yeah , I guess , but there were ... complications . Complications , like what ? Did someone see you ? If you did anything to compromise the safety of this crew ... There is no crew ! This isn 't a spaceship ! I 'm done playing your stupid games . Where do we find her ? I have no idea . She 's always been quite unstable . Hey . Hey . I just got the results back from the command chair , and it 's the victim , plus an unknown female , so we 're closing in . Great . Hey , also , I was thinking that maybe after shift , it would be kind of fun to have a little Astro Quest mini-marathon . Ooh . Like maybe " Yesterday 's Tomorrow , " parts 1 , 2 , and 3 ? You mean the time travel trilogy from season 4 ? Oh , yes . It 's great . Yeah , count me in . Good . Yeah . Hey , uh , I 'll even spring for pizza if it 's not too much of a crowd . Well , two is not much of a crowd , really , so ... You mean just you and me ? Yeah . You , me , the Blu-Ray DVD box set and a brand-new plasma TV . Over at your place ? Yeah . That 's where I keep my TV . Okay , sounds good . Yeah , it will be . Have you ever actually seen one ? I mean , have you ever actually seen one ... in the flesh ? A Tijillian concubine . Feral ... carnal ... voracious . I 'd say she was worth a change in shift . Wouldn 't you ? You 're on fire . Hodges , you 're on fire ! What happened ? I was checking the unknown 's solubility in acetone , when I guess it caught on fire . My mind wandered . That 's been happening a lot lately , Hodges . What 's going on with you ? There 's nothing going on . This is a crime lab , not some Tijillian casbah . Excuse me ? You , me , a DVD ... I don 't think it 's going to help us catch a killer . Are you actually trying to blame all this on me ? Not in so many words . Okay , you know what ? I asked you to come over and watch a DVD - that 's it - so if you 're having some fantasies about me dressed up in a tinfoil bikini , dancing around in a casbah on a strange alien planet , then ... good . Good ? Yes , good , ' cause it means you 're not as oblivious as everyone around here seems to think you are . But the fact is , if you can 't handle the way ... if you can 't handle the way that those fantasies make you feel , don 't turn all that around and blame me when you screw up . Don 't worry about it . It 's not gonna happen again . Well , that 's not the only thing that 's not gonna happen . Fine . Fine . Yeah , she , uh , wandered into the bar a couple hours ago . Totally strung out . Right . Put a little caffeine in her , a little conversation , and she was willing to come in and do the right thing . Okay ... thanks . No problem . Hey , you know , um ... they were giving these away at the convention . You should check it out . You might like it . Thanks . Miss Parvess ? My name is Nick Stokes . I 'm with the crime lab . I really appreciate you ... coming down here to talk with me . Okay , I 'm going to make this real easy for you . I know that Jonathan Danson harassed you in the bar . And I know you were in the booth that night planting your pals ' DVD . I also found evidence of sexual activity on the command chair . Now , listen . If he assaulted you in any way and you fought back , that 's self-defense . You know that , right ? It wasn 't self-defense . I liked his show . I think he must have been able to sense that when he saw me at the bar . I used to be just like you . Tormented by impulses I thought were dirty . Desires that have no place in a squeaky-clean universe . Let go of me . Let go of yourself . Stop trying to be something you 're not , and the guilt that 's eating you alive will fall away . Let me set you free . He took me ... to an incredible place . No preconceptions or judgments . Just ... pure impulse and ... raw instincts . He showed me who I really was . He even gave me his cell phone number . He said he was going to take me to Cabo . Well , I 'd say that confirms at least part of her story . Where did you get this ? Found it on the vic 's laptop . He has quite a collection . And that 's Melinda Carver , his producer . That 's about seven hours before Risa , just before the VIP premiere of his show . It 's good to be the commander . So , what 's the point ? The point is that you didn 't tell me that you were banging the dead guy . That had nothing to do with this . And you didn 't tell me you emptied out your 401 and gave all the money to Danson . We checked his bank records . He needed it to complete the project . Right . He 's been completing a t of projects lately . And according to the GPS tags on those photographs , he 's been working his mojo at most major sci-fi conventions in America . He 's a busy guy . I knew about the other women , because Jon told me about them . We had , uh , an open relationship . Look ... Jon was an extremely ... complicated human being . He was trying to expose the hypocrisy of a sick society . He was a real artist , and that 's all that mattered to me , not who he was poking in that chair . That 's a nice speech . I 'm done talking to you . And that 's a nice purse . I 'm gonna have to hang on to that . Check it for blood . Be my guest . The weird thing about these photos is the camera angle and the background never change . Which means there must be a hidden camera on the set somewhere ? May I ? Yeah . Every shot , the victim 's hand is on that button . It must be some kind of trigger . Mm-hmm . You didn 't notice a camera ? No , I didn 't , but , I mean , they make them pretty small these days . Some of them even have built-in memory . In other words , if we find it , we may have a photo of our killer . The background in the photo is this point here . The beam needs to line up with the left arm of the chair . Bring it up a bit . A little bit more . Perfect . The camera should be somewhere along this beam . I don 't see any camera here . Maybe Danson had a voyeur buddy take the sex pics . Hmm , from the same exact angle every time ? Wendy . I think I 've got it . Got what ? The metallic trace from the victim 's wound . Okay , give me a second . Does this remind you of anything ? Yes . Right ? Yes . Langston . It 's Hodges and Wendy . What do you got ? Yeah , uh , we know what killed Danson . It 's in the helm . Okay , I 'm going to put you on speaker . Now , it 's , it 's in the what ? It 's the console that 's directly opposite the command chair . There 's a retractable viewer inside . It 's from the show . Looks like some kind of piston system . Yeah , th-there should be a control for it someplace . It 's called a targeting scanner . I think we have it . We also have a digital sex camera . And blood , 90-degree angle . Silver metal paint and a bloody fingerprint . Nice work , people . See you back at the lab . Nice work , Hodges . You , too , Simms . Is she mad at you again ? Why don 't you two just get it over with ? You 've been dancing around it for years . Just tell her how you feel . Tell her what , Mr. Andrews ? That I 'd never be able to give myself to her fully ? Because I 've made a commitment ... to this lab . The pursuit of justice . Do you think it 's easy ? In the dead of night , I can 't help but wonder what it 'd be like to savor the pleasures of ordinary men . Moonlit dinners . Murmured endearments . The caress of a woman 's soft skin . Long , languid walks on the beach . But you hate the beach . It 's understandable , I guess , considering your complexion . What ? It 's good that you 're politically active because if you weren 't , you wouldn 't have been arrested at that sit-in at Global Media six years ago . Caught in the web of the combine . That 's a reference to One Fl ... Yeah , One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . I know . And I also know that you didn 't mean to kill Jonathan Danson . I know that . It happened . But this is your one chance to get out in front of it , so tell me what happened . Just tell me the truth , and I promise I 'll do everything I can to help you . I will . Jonathan Danson took my media semiotics course . He was a good student . I heard about his project and thought it would be perfect material for my documentary . But then I saw Redux . I 'm gonna do her ! I swear I 'm gonna do her ! I gave a lecture once , deconstructing Astro Quest as an example . Jonathan had integrated all of my conceits into his fictional construct . He stole your idea . He didn 't ask for permission . He , he didn 't even acknowledge me in the credits . You want credit ? Now , why would I give you that ? Because they 're my ideas . Whatever happened to " Nobody can own an idea " ? Let me tell you something . Ideas are a dime a dozen . If you want to make them into art , it takes drive , vision , creativity . Hey , I have created ... What ? Hyperintellectual diarrhea ? Go back to writing theory papers for the six other people in your department who read them . I 've got a TV show to make . You ! Let me go ! Not until you cool down . You gonna be cool ? Yes . 20 years devoted to media theory . Talk about a wasted life . You see the irony , don 't you ? Jon attempted to deconstruct Astro Quest 's iconography , and he was killed by one of the signifiers he sought to subvert . Derrida , Derrida would have called that ... An epistemological dichotomy ? I just call it second-degree murder . Anybody up for a little Astro Quest ? Oh , no , not tonight . Thanks , though . All right . Break room in five . Let 's go . Uh , no , thanks . Enjoy . " A Dollop of Apocalypse . " Oh , that 's the one where they find this planet where , um , amphibians are the dominant species , and they worship Peyton Place as a sacred text . It 's classic . W - Wait , the amphibians can read and they choose that ? There 's a reason for it . You 'll see . Jihw-CHOK chom-CHEM jag-eej BRYCE cichoki . I don 't speak Vellikon . What 'd you say ? Anytime you 're ready , Ecklie . You will leave me ... now ? The lab needs me . You have needs of your own , as do I. Maybe someday our needs will coincide . I hope so . Until then ... Someday .

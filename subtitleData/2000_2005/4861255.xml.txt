Bring me light , and any supplies you have . You sanguine about the reception we 're apt to receive on an alliance ship ? absolutely . - What 's sanguine mean ? - Sanguine , hopeful . plus , point of interest , it also means bloody . That pretty much covers all the options , don 't it ? We 're requesting aid . No other purpose . We got papers . - What 's your business ? - We 're a supply ship , freelance . Had an accident this morning , crewman got hurt . ZOE : We need medical help . Faster be better than slow . official seal 's out of date , Captain Harbatkin ? We ain 't had a checkpoint in a while .

DORALEE : She 's not quite right , is she ? SIMON : She 's been through some trauma . She 's recovering though . She won 't get a good conversation out of Ruby . I can tell you that much . That little girl 's mute . Do you know the cause ? - Was she born deaf ? - No . She was fine until two years ago when she stopped talking . A place like this might be good for your sister . Quiet , safe . A place where folks take care of each other . Yes . Seems like a lovely little community of kidnappers . The Lord says " judge not . " They took us off the street . Sometimes life takes you places you weren 't expecting to go . Life didn 't bring us here . Those men did . You were on a transport ship , right ? Taking a journey ? The way of Iife in my findings is , journeys end where and when they want to ... ... and that 's where you make your home . This isn 't our home . If it isn 't here , where is it ? This place gives me an uncomfortableness . So , what do you figure ? Shepherd 's got some kind of connection with the alliance ? That 's what it looks like . It would surprise me if he did . See ? That 's my whole problem with picking up tourists . Ain 't never what they claim . Does seem like everyone 's got a tale to tell . River ? River ? - What 's wrong ? - River 's gone . So 's the girl . Ruby . I 'II check out back . River . Don 't- - What is that ? [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] Oh . I picked them . Here . They 'II stain your dress . You have to eat . Hodgeberries . Remember when we found those giant Hodgeberry bushes ... ... on the Cambersons ' estate ? And we thought they 'd grown wild , but ... . A long while ago . - I took you away from there . - No . I know I did . You don 't think I do , but ... . I get confused . I remember everything . I remember too much . And some of it 's made-up . And some of it can 't be quantified . And there 's secrets , and ... . It 's okay . But I understand . You gave up everything you had to find me . You found me broken . It 's hard for you . You gave up everything you had . Maybe everything I have is right here . You need to eat . Keep up your strength . We won 't be here long . Daddy will come and take us home . And I 'II get better . I 'II get better . These are better than the Cambersons ' berries . They are . Except they 're poison . You believed her . Made a face . You are such a brat . You get to bed now . We should probably think about doing the same . It 's been a big day , what with the abduction and all . well , y 'aII don 't have to sleep here . There 's a house set aside for you . We 've been looking for a doctor for a good while , so things are ready . really ? Her sister got killed . Mother got crazy , killed the sister . That one lived . Ruby talked to you , honey ? It 's true what she 's saying . Poor woman went out of her mind , tried to kill her two girls . Ruby lived . Sweetheart , you are an angel . No one 's been able to get Ruby to speak even a peep . It 's a miracle ! That 's what it is . Ruby doesn 't talk . Her voice got scared away . I hear crickets . I don 't understand . If Ruby didn 't talk , how do you know ... ? My sister 's ... .

I just spent 2000 credits to get you out of here . I had to walk through that door , which goes on my permanent profile . - Are you trying to destroy this family ? - I didn 't realize it wouId be so easy . - Dad , I didn 't do anything . - You were in a blackout zone . talking to someone who might be able to help River . And I 'm going right back there . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] This is a slippery slope , young man . You have no idea how far down you can go . You 're not taking us with you . Meaning what ? I won 't come for you again . You end up here or get mixed up in something worse , you 're on your own . I will not come for you . Now are you coming home ? This is lunacy ! You 're supposed to be the teacher here . What exactly is it you teach ? What 's going on , woman ? Why are you knocking us from our beds ? The new doctor 's sister 's a witch ! She read Ruby 's mind . - Saw things she couldn 't . - No , River is not a witch . She 's just a troubled girl . I 'm sure that 's true . You 're not a witch , are you- - ? I 'm the patron here . Do you know what that means ? Yes . You 're in charge . Ever since the old patron died . That 's right . He was sick and he was getting better . And you were alone in the room with him . SIMON : No !

What kind of ident card gets us that kind of reception and send off ? I am a Shepherd . - folks like a man of God . - No , they don 't . Men of God make everyone feel guilty and judged . That 's not what I saw . You like to tell me what really happened ? I surely would . And maybe someday I will . It 's good to be home . Badger just hailed us . Getting impatient for his share . Wants us to drop it on the Common Fed Base . That 'II be a Iot easier to do without the two most wanted on board . Life would look to be simpler with us not carrying any ' fugees . He is right , you know . Yeah . simpler . Take me instead . Take my Iife for hers . The witch must die . God commands it . No ! Get away from her ! She has done nothing to you ! If she dies tonight , it won 't be God 's will that killed her , it 'II be you ! Your Iunacy ! Your ignorance ! That 's not gonna stop us , doctor . Post-hoIer . Digging holes for posts . Light it . Time to go . MALCOLM : well , look at this . Appears we got here just in the nick of time . What does that make us ? Big damn heroes , sir . Ain 't we just . Sorry to interrupt , folks . Y 'aII got something that belongs to us , and we 'd Iike it back . This is a holy cleansing . You cannot think to thwart God 's will . Y 'aII see the man hanging out of the spaceship with the really big gun ? I 'm not saying you weren 't easy to find , but it was kind of out of our way ... ... and he didn 't wanna come in the first place . Man 's looking to kill some folk . It 's his will you should worry about thwarting . Gotta say , doctor , this town 's real and the folks are near miraculous . Yes , I 'm very proud . Cut her down . The girl is a witch . Yeah , but she 's our witch . So cut her the hell down . Hey , doctor . glad you 're back now on the ship . Thanks . I 've moved him to his room . - How 's he faring ? - He 's gonna be fine .

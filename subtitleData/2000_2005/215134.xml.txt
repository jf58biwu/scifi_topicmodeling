Chigusa , can 't you wait a little ? I missed you guys . Kuninobu ... Man , my ass hurt . Before I quit , I told you not to bother coming , and you really started boycotting school . That 's no good . You 're no good , but you thought you 'd come along on the class trip anyway , huh ? Listen up ! Because of folks like Kuninobu here , this country 's absolutely no good anymore so the bigwigs got together and passed this law : Battle Royale So today 's lesson is ... you kill each other off .

 I don 't think it 's gonna clear up . It won 't last long . It 's not raining that hard . - It was so nice this morning . - Yeah . It 'll clear up . If it doesn 't , we 'll just have a picnic in the car . Daddy , I want to go outside and play . You 're gonna get all wet , sweetie . - Maybe later . - Please . It 's a very light shower . Please , I won 't get wet . OK . But for just a minute . - And I want you to come right back . - I promise . - Have fun . - I will . We treated you as an equal . That wasn 't enough . You had to cross the line . I 'd put in for a transfer if I were you . - Where are you going for dinner ? - Chez Michael 's . That 's gonna set you back . Elizabeth has been married to me for 35 years . - She deserves a nice meal . - Have a good evening , Orson . You need to slow down . I 'm not driving into town for another six-pack . You 're afraid my Dad will kick your ass if I smell like beer . Evil cousin Shawn . That 's me . Corruptor of the innocent . Your neighbour . What 's her name ? - She seems ready for some corruption . - You mean Nikki ? - She 's 14 , Kyle . - 14 ? - Yeah . - Hmm . Hmm . Would it be fair to say that this comet is close in size to Haley 's Comet , or is it a little bigger ? As far as comets go , this one 's a little smaller than Haley 's . But what makes this interesting to us is how close it will pass by Earth . What are the projections on how close it will get ? Hey , kiddo . You 're missing the show . It 's a big comet . NASA says we 'll never see one closer in our lifetime . Yeah , I didn 't think that would work . Hi . - How is he ? - Same . Same as always . Some of your mail 's still coming to the house . I 'll call the post office . Hi , baby . I haven 't seen you for a few days . I can 't make it every day . Not any more . Not after three years . Are we supposed to just give up on him ? I better go . Linda , just wait . Linda ! - Linda ! - It 's not a competition , Tom ! It 's not about who can sit by his side the longest . I still love him . I just can 't live here like you do . I know . I wasn 't accusing you . You got a bill from Olympian Investigations . More private detectives ? We were onto something . Someone matching Shawn 's description . But it wasn 't him , was it ? Shawn could be anywhere . Even if you found him , it wouldn 't wake Kyle up . - At least I 'd have some answers . - I 'm worried about you , Tom . Finding Shawn and figuring out what happened to our son is my job . How can you not know that ? You look tired . Try and get some rest . I thought we were watching the comet . Oh , yeah , the comet . Is it supposed to be that bright ? - Skouris . - Get over here . Now . This cannot be good . Listen up , everyone . We 're Defcon One . These envelopes are orders from HomeSec . Our first priority is secure SeaTac Airport , ground all the planes . Gather up all the foreign dignitaries in the area . Get them , the local elected officials , take them all to the shelters . - Sid , bring me up to speed . - The comet 's not a flyby any more . It 's heading right at us . Sir , it just changed course again . - A comet can 't change course . - It has . - Then it 's not a comet . - Velocity is ... - 3,000kms a second . - How long do we have ? - Impact in 28 minutes . - Sir . Ryland . Understood . China just launched its missiles at it . We 're going next . The US military has launched a volley of 24 Titan Two missiles . Danny , what 's going on ? All right , our missiles are in the air . - England launched . - France . Russia . The first flight of missiles will intercept in 15 seconds . Nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four three ... two ... one ... We should get inside . Multiple hits . I think they got it . At least nine of the missiles have hit their target . The comet has ... - It 's still headed for us . - How hard will it hit ? Something that big , that fast ... You don 't want to know . You don 't want to know . I 'm scared . I 'm gonna go find my parents , OK ? Hey , Dad , if you 're there , can you pick up the phone ? It 's Diana . You know , your daughter ? - Just tell my brother that I love him . - Tell Mummy that I love her , OK ? Nancy , it 's Dad . I just wanted to tell you I love you . Impact with Earth now appears ... Tom , it 's Susan . What is going on ? Isn 't there a shelter we can go to ? You still work for Homeland Security . Susan , it doesn 't matter . Shelters aren 't gonna make a damn bit of difference . Just ... I 'm sorry . I love you , sis . Just hug Danny close and pray for the best . A British missile hit the object , but it 's still coming . - It 's entered the atmosphere . - I got it on radar . - It 's slowing down . - What ? It 's at Mach seven . Mach two . It 's going subsonic . It 's continuing to lose speed . It 's as if it 's coming in for a landing . - What ? Like a plane ? - No , more like the mother ship . Give me some coordinates . Where 's it going ? 47 north longitude , 122 , maybe 123 west latitude . That 's by Mount Rainier . That 's our backyard . Come on , get the shot ! We 're at Mount Rainier . The ball of light is massive . 100 , 200 feet in diameter . It 's hard to tell . We 'll try to get closer . I can tell you that this is , without a doubt , one of the most incredible sights I 've ever seen . We 're looking for an official from the government . Jim ? Jim , now , what 's going on ? We 're not sure what 's just happened . The ball of light is gone . Thousands of people have just suddenly appeared ! This is amazing . There are thousands of people . - I think I just ... I saw your brother ! - Shawn ? Yeah ! Pull me all the files from the northern counties . I want back in . Tom , do you have any idea what I 'm wading through here ? Over 4,000 people stepped out of a ball of light and landed in my lap . Some have been gone 60 years , none have any memory of what happened . - And you want back in ? - I can help . I needed help from you before . When HomeSec asked me who I wanted from the Bureau , your name was at the top of the list . - What did I get from you ? - Five months . Five months . Then an indefinite leave of absence . You made fools of both of us . I needed to know what happened to my son . And that 's the reason you want back in . Your nephew is one of the returnees . I admit I have a personal stake in this . That 's why I 'll come through for you . I need answers , too . Diana Skouris , Tom Baldwin . You 'll be investigating what happened to the returnees . - Skouris . Ex-CDC , right ? - Yeah , I heard of you , too . - You 're kidding . - Is there a problem ? He went MIA once . Who 's to say he won 't do it again ? Me . Is this where you say , " Be a good soldier " ? No , this is where I say you 're my best field scientist and Tom is my best lead investigator , and together you 're gonna make a good team . Well , it should be interesting . Huh . Nice to meet you , too . Beautiful . The sooner we find out what 's going on , the better for us . The better for them . - What 's your name ? - Julius . - Anita . - Amanda . I wanna see my family . Orson Bailey . - It 's not possible . - Fine , it 's 1979 . - So for them , no time has past . - Last night was our anniversary . So where do you think they 've been ? I don 't know . There had to be some kind of intelligence behind it . Is it the hand of God or little green men ? I 'm not discounting anything . Look . This is an interesting one . - They 're dead , aren 't they ? - This is Maia Rutledge . She was the first one to disappear . She 's eight , only she was born in 1938 . I 'll be OK . Mostly . She 's a tough little kid . There 's a returnee I 'd like to interview myself . Yeah , so I 've been told . Returnee 2,117 . Shawn Farrell . He 's all yours . We just want access . They deserve to see their families , to receive representation . - They 've done nothing wrong . - We don 't know that . These people could be walking time bombs , disease vectors , spies . She doesn 't like us much . The feeling 's mutual . - The secretary of state is coloured ? - Black . I 'll take your word for it . And the national security advisor , too . The world sure has changed since ' 51 . You should try to relax . You won 't get out any quicker by wearing a groove in the floor . - Are you a jailhouse philosopher ? - Barracks philosopher . I was a combat pilot in Korea . - Nice tattoo . Who 's Lily ? - A girl I used to know . Shawn Farrell to interview room one . See you . - What 's your name , sir ? - Orson Bailey . I want to speak to someone in charge . Why can 't I make a call ? Uncle Tommy ! Hi ! It 's good to see you ! What 's going on ? Nobody will tell us anything . We 'll let you know as soon as we find out . I ... - I can 't believe it 's you . - How do you think I feel ? Do you know how long they 're gonna keep us ? I really want to go home . Shawn , er ... Do you remember anything ? Anything at all about what happened that night ? Nothing . Nothing . One minute I 'm sitting with Kyle on the beach , the next it 's three years later and I 'm standing next to a mountain with a couple thousand strangers around me . Listen , Uncle Tommy , some people are saying that ... we were abducted by aliens . We can 't rule anything out yet . Well , can you give me anything ? - How 's my mum ? How 's Danny ? - Fine . - They miss you . - Great . What about Kyle ? He must have seen something the night I disappeared . Did he tell you anything ? - He hasn 't said a word . - He 's OK , isn 't he ? - Isn 't he ? - Kyle 's in a coma , Shawn . What are you talking about ? Kyle 's lying on a bed being fed through one tube and pissing out another , and he 's been like that ever since the night you left . He was fine . We were having a couple of beers . - Don 't lie to me . - I 'm not . I 've waited three years to hear the truth from you so please don 't lie to me . I just told you the truth . Is that what you 've been thinking this whole time ? That I gave Kyle something that messed him up and I just took off ? Screw you , Uncle Tommy . I just told you everything I know . Goddamn it ! You look as bored as I feel . I wish there were windows in this place . I 'd like to see the stars . Wouldn 't you ? - Do I look that bad ? - No , it 's ... You remind me of someone I used to know . - How long have you been gone ? - Since ' 51 . Wouldn 't be me , then . ' 93 . - I 'm Richard . - Lily . My friend . Her name was Lily , too . Lily Bonham . That 's my grandmother 's name . - Lily Bonham from St Louis ? - You knew my grandmother . - Is she still alive ? - I 'm sorry . She died before I was born . Are you all right ? Lily 's dead and I 'm sitting here with her granddaughter . Doesn 't make any goddamn sense at all . I know how you feel . I keep thinking I 'll wake up and tell my husband all about this dream . - You have a family ? - Yeah . Brian and I and our daughter , Heidi . She was six months when I ... So what was she like ? My grandmother . Everyone says I look a lot like her . They were right . - That 's not possible right now . - This is ridiculous . You 've got no right to hold us . We haven 't done anything wrong . I 'm sorry . This is for you . We 're letting them go ? They 've only been back six weeks . It 's too soon . The court of appeal 's upheld a lawsuit by the ACLU on behalf of the families . - We have no right to hold them . - Some of them have no place to go . Egypt and China won 't repatriate its citizens . India 's on the fence . Whoever wants to stay can stay . American citizens who leave will get the assistance required to get their life on track - Medicare , Unemployment , rent vouchers , vocational training . - We need to isolate these people . - They 're human beings not viruses . The order 's been given . We 're letting them go . I wouldn 't book your vacations just yet . Each Homeland Security office will be responsible for the returnees in their region . We 'll be monitoring 79 people plus another 135 who have chosen to remain in quarantine for now . Each returnee will check in once a week . Any difficulties faced by our returnees will be handled by this office . Finally , we 'll continue with our investigation . We 'll all sleep better once we know what the hell 's going on . Thank you . You look so lonely without an ID number . I 'm supposed to be 82 years old . There 's no one here waiting for me . So what are you going to do ? Head back to the old neighbourhood , I suppose . What about you ? Wait . Let me guess . - Take your daughter to Woodland Park . - We used to love that place . Of course , Heidi was barely crawling then , and now she 's twelve . Er ... You 've been a good friend . - They said there 'd be a bus to the city . - Right over there . - Hey , Mum ! Danny ! - Shawn ! Brian ! Brian ! Sorry , I ... Let 's go . - Can I help you ? - Heidi ? - Yeah . - Heidi , it 's Mummy . - Who ? - Heidi ? It 's OK , sweetie . I got it . Brian . Lily . Look at you . You haven 't aged a day . Why didn 't you come and pick me up ? Didn 't they contact you ? Yeah . You have to understand . I didn 't think I was ever going to see you again . I 'm married , Lily . Carol has been a really good mother to Heidi . We have a son now , too . A little boy . I 'm sorry , Lil , I 'm ... Lily ... Elizabeth . Orson ? Where have you been ? I 've been waiting for you . I know . Where 's the car ? We 're going to be late for dinner . I 'm sorry , hon . Things got a little out of control . But it won 't happen again . - Hey , Mum . - It 's good to see you ! Oh , hey , Joel . Good to see you . Sorry your buddies couldn 't show . I guess they 're away at college . They 're jealous I get to enjoy two more years of high school . High school 's not that bad . Hey , Shawn . - Remember me ? - Nikki ? No ! Last time I saw you you were just a little kid . - Lucky me , huh ? - Yeah , I guess so . What the hell are you looking at ? - I used to live here . - Yeah ? Well , I live here now . Get the hell outta here . - Why am I here ? - To put a human face on the returnees . To remind you they 're people , not viruses . - Tom . Who is your new friend ? - This is my partner . My work partner . Diana Skouris , this is my wife Linda . - Hi . - Nice to meet you . We 're separated . Call me . We need to talk . - Well , that was awkward . - Really ? I hadn 't noticed . Give me a second . - You look thirsty . - Thank you . I just wanted you to know , I really am glad you 're back . Whatever . You ... Jeez . - Neck 's broken . - Reflection must have confused him . Come back inside . You 're missing your own party . It 's just weird being in there ... - I guess he was just stunned . - Yeah . - Yeah , I guess so . - See you in there . I have to see the doctor every week ? It doesn 't sound like much fun to me either but ... you get to live with these lovely people . And that beats a bunk in quarantine , right ? - There 's nothing we can 't handle , right ? - That would be nice . We should get going . It 's a bit of a drive . Terrific . Good luck , Maia . - You 'll see me again . - Yeah . Next week . Sooner than that . When we bought the building , your mother said , " That old thing ? " - Can I get you anything ? - Water would be fine . Mary , get Mr Bailey some water ? Just down here . You look exactly the same as the last time I saw you . And you were 13 . Your father asked me to show you the ropes . Looks like I succeeded . - Have a seat . - Thank you . So what can I do for you , Mr Bailey ? My old corner office for starters , a secretary , some business cards . I can start seeing clients in a week . - You 're looking for a job ? - This is still Kensington and Bailey . I 'm embarrassed . Times are tight . I just had to lay off three of my actuaries . - I don 't have any openings right now . - " Openings " ? I 'm a partner here . Your interest was bought out when you were declared dead . I 'm not dead . - It is all legal . - Don 't be too sure of that . What happened to me , there is no precedent . But it might be years until precedent is established . Until that happens , all of you ... returnees will have to plead your case in front of a judge . - Do you have the ... - Have you seen where my wife is ? I have to get her out of there . I need money . Now . The living room . There 's the kitchen . Do you want to see your room ? It 's the one over here . - Here . - We just had it redone . It 's a very nice room . I got you a few outfits . Tomorrow you can pick out some more yourself . OK . Maia , honey . We have a rule . No shoes on the furniture . - I don 't want them to get wet . - Wet ? Why would they get wet ? Why don 't you get cleaned up ? We 're gonna eat soon . Anita ? Adam , it 's Orson . Let me in . I want to talk . I know you can hear . Let me in ! You want me to wake the whole neighbourhood ? - Tom . - What are you doing here ? Your phone is off . Ryland wants us to come in . - What 's up ? - There 's been a murder . The police are holding one of the 4400 . That 's Orson Bailey . Bailey . Some kind of businessman , right ? - Life insurance . - Disappeared in the ' 70s . '79 . Declared dead in ' 86 . Seattle police are holding him in connection with a homicide . - They know he 's one of the 4400 ? - Bailey told them . The returnees were told not to discuss their status . We counsel them to avoid it if they can but we were talking interviews and applications . There 's no protocol for murder enquiries . - You said holding not charging ? - Right . There are conflicting reports about what went on . - We 'll check it out . - Quietly . - I don 't want to dodge microphones . - Quietly it is . Diana . Hi , this is Linda . I can 't take your call right now but please leave a message . Linda , it 's me again . You said we needed to talk so pick up the phone . Linda , come on . All right , call me . - Everything OK ? - Same old same old . I wish she 'd make up her mind . - I had a boyfriend once . Every ... - Boyfriend ? Well , don 't look so surprised . - Yeah , anyway . The thing about ... - You can stop . I barely got started . You don 't have to try to make me feel better . It was more of an attempt at bonding via a shared similar experience . Can you open the door ? How long did you go out with this guy ? - Nine months . - Nine months . You 're equating your nine months with my 19 years . You 're right . OK . Forget it . You want me to drive ? - What for ? - So you can brood . Just get in . Look who floated in on a ball of light . - Remember me , Farrell ? - Rossi . Hi . Looks like the steroids finally kicked in . Funny , man . Always did appreciate your sense of humour . Like when you sold me those tickets . To the Foo Fighters ? How was the show ? Cops were waiting for me when I showed up . The tickets were stolen . I got arrested . - You got arrested for stolen tickets ? - Yeah . I had five tabs of X on me . I had to pee in a cup once a week for two years . - Stop it ! - Get off of him ! - It 's between me and your brother . - I say it 's between you and me . See you round , freak . By the way , I like the new paint job on your ride . Are you OK ? Fine . The cameras caught everything . He had a bug up his ass . But he never went inside . Kensington fell and impaled himself . - You 've seen all the footage ? - Yes . - Bailey never made it past the gate . - Hold on . Did you see that ? - That 's glass . - Yeah . Something blew out the windows from the inside . We 're trying to figure that out . There was no seismic activity , no bomb or gas leak . - And Bailey 's not talking ? - I 've sent half a dozen guys in . He hasn 't given us anything . I 've been over and over this with you people . We 're Homeland Security . Tell the bozos out there I had nothing to do with what happened to Adam . Let 's go over your day . You went to see Adam about a job . Even though your name is still on the letterhead , he brushed you off . - I know how that 'd make me feel . - I admit I was angry . I went to Adam 's house to ... I don 't know why I went . But I didn 't kill him . Let me read you an e-mail Kensington sent his attorney after your visit . It 's not important . " Bailey is making claims regarding his stake in the company . " He threatened to sue . There will be hundreds of law suits involving the 4400 . " It 'll take years . Poor bastard . He really is rather a pathetic case . " I am not a lawyer but I 'm not an idiot either . You 've had me here for twelve hours . Either you charge me with something or let me go . - We 're gonna let him walk ? - Looks like it . If I ever want to play good cop , bad cop , I 'll let you know . - Which one am I ? - This isn 't a joke . There 's a time to lean on a guy . That wasn 't it . Look , I 'm sorry . But Bailey admitted he was angry with Kensington . - He was at his house . - I didn 't say it was over , did I ? Do you think they thought about me ? Oh , sweetie ! They were your parents ! I am sure that they thought about you every day . Thanks for bringing me here . This place used to be so nice . Now the kids leave garbage everywhere . - It 's a shame . - You don 't have to worry . - Crown Ridge is nice . - Crown Ridge Cemetery ? Yes . - That 's where you will be . - Be ? Be what ? Buried . Kensington is a popular guy today . The whole staff 's seen the post mortem . Why is that ? He might have been a boring suit alive , but in death , he 's a rock star . God , look at that . Those were his parietal bones ? We 've seen terrible beating deaths . One guy jumped off the Space Needle and was brought to us in a garbage bag . But I have never seen a skull in this kind of shape before . - Thousands of tiny bone fragments ... - He was impaled . - That 's not how he died ? - That would have killed him . But he was already dead from his shattered skull . - Hello . - Hello , is Lily there ? - Who ? - Is this Heidi ? Yes . I 'm Richard Tyler . A friend of your mother 's . My mother 's name is Carol . Are you sure you have the right number ? This is the Moore residence , isn 't it ? Yeah , but there 's no one named Lily here . Sorry . I 'm afraid I can 't give you any medicine for the nausea . - Why not ? - Because it wouldn 't work . You 're not sick , Lily , you 're pregnant . That 's impossible . The quarantine doctors would have told me . They gave you a full screening seven weeks ago . If you 'd just conceived it wouldn 't have shown . Conceived ? When ? I assume , right before you disappeared . But there 's no mistake . You 're definitely pregnant . There 's nothing to worry about . But I 'd like to see you again next week when you 're used to the information . - Shawn . - Hey . - How are you doin ' ? - Good . - Did you get your car fixed ? - It 'll be in the shop for a week . Yeah ? Danny and I are going to a party tonight at Evie Chobin 's house . You should come . - I don 't think so . - Why not ? They 're gonna be listening to music I 've never heard , talking about movies I 've never seen . School is bad enough . Partying with runts from ... Is that how you saw me ? A runt ? - You were 14 , Nikki . - And now ? I 'm late for class . Where 's my wife ? - My wife . Where is she ? - You have our deepest condolences . - We called . There was no answer . - Elizabeth ? It was a pulmonary embolism . We tried to revive her . - No ! - Please , calm down . - She 's dead ? - Mr Bailey ! - She 's all I have . - Let go of me ! - Let go of me ! Please ! - No ! Get away from me ! So the dots are where the American members of the 4400 originally lived . - You mean the returnees . - According to the press , it 's " the 4400 " . You have to admit it 's a bit strange , a nice round number like that . I wonder if it has any significance . So if 3,781 people had shown up that night it wouldn 't have been as strange ? I 'd say slightly less strange . This , however , is downright weird . Here 's where the 4400 are now , two weeks after their release . - 65 % are still in Seattle . - They 're just not going home . - And none of them can say why . - You think it means something ? In the CDC we 'd call this a statistically significant disease cluster . In the FBI we 'd call it a coincidence . I don 't believe in coincidences . Disease clusters ... I believe in those . - You 're pregnant ? - Yes . When you disappeared I 'd been in New York for weeks . I haven 't been with anyone else . - We 're talking immaculate conception ? - I don 't know . I wish I did . You know , when you disappeared , I 'd have given anything to talk to you . I 'd have whole conversations with you in my head . I missed you so much , Lil . But we can 't do this . I have another family now . I know that 's not fair but ... I am part of your life whether you want me to be or not . You haven 't been part of my life for 11 years . I want to see Heidi . - That 's impossible . - She 's my daughter . She doesn 't know that . She thinks that Carol is her mother . - You never told her about me ? - She was a baby . - We were babies . - You can 't stop me from seeing her . I already have . - What is that ? - It 's a temporary restraining order . - I haven 't done anything wrong . - I 'm a lawyer . I know how to work the system . I will only use this if you force me to . - My priority is protecting my family . - I am your family . I wish you were . But you 're not . Not any more . I 'm sorry , Lil . I 'm asking you , please stay away from Heidi . And from me . I 'm sorry , Lily . At first I thought it was an earthquake . Everything was shaking . Then ... I can 't believe I 'm going to say this ... Things started to fly around the room . Paper . Chairs . - What do you mean , " fly " ? - I mean , fly , like it was a tornado . Except there was no wind . Everybody was screaming . My head felt like it was gonna burst . Then suddenly it was over . - What about Bailey ? - He looked scared . Like the rest of us . That 's when he ran away . The staff ... Everyone 's saying he 's one of these people . The 4400 . - Is that true ? - Listen to me very carefully . You are not going to talk about this to the press . If I see this reported on the news , we 'll take an interest in this place . - Things flying around the room ? - All the witnesses say the same . Flying ? I 've got to do a briefing for HomeSec DC and I 'll tell him what ? " The incident is under investigation . " Bailey checked out of his hotel . He could be on the run . Find him . You bought us some time but this story 's gonna leak and I want Bailey in our hands before it does . So is Calculus everything you remember it to be ? You heard about Williams and Miss Sinclair ? - No ? They found them in the closet . - What ? - Making out , not dead . - What ? Everybody 's been talking about it . Yo , freak . Still hiding behind your little brother ? You know what , Brad ? You need to shut it down . You want to shut me down ? The only thing I 'm shutting down is you , bitch . - You 're starting to piss me off . - Come on . Bring it . Shut me down . - Let him go ! - Shawn ! What did you do to him ? - I don 't want her here any more . - Hey ! She 'll hear you . It 's bad enough she says we 'll be buried there , but then we get a brochure ? It 's a coincidence . Look , she 's not what we expected , so let 's just talk to her . Yeah . Maia ... It 's OK . I knew I wasn 't going to be here very long . Come on . Come on , let 's go . Give me the ball . - Your shot , space boy . - What is your problem ? - What is my problem ? - Yeah , what 's your problem ? - What did you do to Brad ? - Not you , too . Come on . The way he went down ? That 's not normal . You know it , I know it . Everybody saw it . - What are you saying ? - You tell me . I didn 't do anything to him , all right ? Not a thing . Is this all that 's left when you 're done ? Poor Mrs Bailey . It 's a box of trinkets . They 're not trinkets . They 're memories . The kind you leave behind , for family , friends . - I should get to work on that . - I 'm not going there . Believe it or not , some of us are happier alone . If anyone thinks they 're happy alone , they 're kidding themselves . I thought you weren 't going there . You see this ? This looks promising . " Wyler Summer Cabin . " Wyler was Elizabeth 's maiden name . Orson 's panicking , he needs a place to run . - There 's no address . - We 'll have to find one . It 's better this way . For everyone . Everyone ? Or just you ? Maia , honey . You know this isn 't about you . You are a wonderful girl . It 's just ... Kenneth and I ... We just made a mistake . We 're not ready to be parents yet . - It 's OK . - No , it 's not . But sweetie , those things you say . They can scare people if you 're not careful . Do you understand ? Good . For you . Come on . Take it . - What is it ? - A CD I burned . Think of it as a crash course in all things new and cool . - The bands you 've never heard of . - Thanks . But Nikki , I could listen to all the music and watch all the shows , but they 'll still think I 'm different . But you 'll be listening to good music . I don 't understand , see . Everybody has been looking at me like I 'm a monster . But you ... Aren 't you afraid to be seen with me ? No . What do I care what those creeps think ? If you like the CD , I 'll burn you another one . - Sounds great . - All right . OK . - See you . - Talk to you later . OK . Bring up the satellite shots . So we 're looking for a small house with a north-facing exposure somewhere near Appleton Lake . - If it 's still standing . - No structures in grids 1 , 2 , 3 and 9 . 4 and 7 each have one but they 're the wrong shape . - Eliminate all those . - That leaves us with 5 , 6 and 8 . That 's too small . That 's the wrong orientation . That 's too small . That 's too big . It 's not there anymore . Hang on . Get a little tighter on this . It looks like it could be a house . These trees would be huge by now . Enlarge again . - Bingo . There 's your house . - Bingo . Appleton is what , about 70 miles ? Yeah . And look , when we get up there ... - I 'll handle Bailey . - All right . - Are we leaning on him ? - No leaning . - No problem . - Excuse me , are you Tom Baldwin ? Yeah . Who are you ? You 've been served . Sorry , man . You 're getting sued ? Linda 's filed for divorce . - Over this way . - Get ready . - Lily . - Richard ! Richard ! I don 't understand . I thought you went home . I did but there was nothing there for me . How did you find me here ? Woodland Park , right ? This is where you used to bring Heidi . Richard , it was terrible . Brian 's married and Heidi doesn 't know I exist . - Hello , Maia . - Hello . Oh , I like it out here . It 's much better than my stuffy office . But you didn 't bring me out here to talk about the weather . - You 're a very smart little girl . - Thank you . The thing is that the Griffins didn 't give a reason why they brought you back . Maybe they didn 't have a reason . It could be . - Were they mean to you ? - No . - Were you mean to them ? - No . Why do you think you 're back here ? I don 't think they like kids much . Why do you say that ? They brought me back and I 'm a kid . You don 't really want to tell me the reason , do you ? It 's OK . Maybe you 'll change your mind one day . Maybe . Hi , this is Linda . I can 't take your call right now but please leave a message . - She 's still not answering ? - Nope . - Can I ask you a question ? - No . I 'm gonna ask you anyway . Your son . How long has he been in a coma ? Three years . - That 's a long time . - You have no idea . Maybe you and your wife can work things out . One day Kyle will wake up and I 'll have to tell him his family 's fallen apart . I go to that hospital every day and I tell myself that makes me a good father . You are a good father . Kyle 's lucky to have a dad like you . Not everyone does . You can trust me cos I know . A baby ? Are you sure ? I had the doctors do the tests three times . The thing is that Brian was out of town when I disappeared and I haven 't been with anyone since I 've been back . - I don 't understand . How could you ... - I don 't know . I 'm sorry to dump this on you . It 's not really fair . It 's OK . I ... I want to help . There 's some sort of connection between us , isn 't there ? - I feel it . - I can feel it , too . That 's why I came back . But it 's more complicated than that . Your grandmother and I ... We weren 't just friends . It was ... It was more than that . We were gonna start a family . I think part of me already knew that . The way you talk about her . The look in your eye . I thought I was playing it so safe . It must have been difficult . A white woman and a black man in the ' 50s . Hmm . " Black . " Back then I was " Negro " or " coloured " or worse . But we didn 't care . We figured after the war we 'd take off to some big city like Chicago or New York or Paris . - But you never made it home . - No . I never did . I 'm glad you found me . Me too . Mr Bailey , it 's Tom Baldwin , Homeland Security . We met at the police station , remember ? We 're here to help . You 've got to talk to us . - Go away . - We can 't do that . I just want to be left alone . I don 't want to hurt anyone . Good cos we don 't want anyone else hurt . If you leave , I promise no one will ever see me again . I 'll just stay here away from everyone . You know that 's not going to work . Open the door . We can figure this out . I 'm on your side . No , you 're not . No one is . My nephew is one of the 4400 just like you . It 's hard for him . It 's harder for you . You don 't know anything . My wife . She was everything to me . - I 'm sorry for your loss . - I don 't want any pity . Go away ! I just want to be left alone . - We can 't do that . - I said ... get away from me . Stay away . Please . Tom ! Your nose ! I can 't control it . Whatever it is you 're doing , stop it ! - I can 't control it ! - Stop it ! Now ! - Are you all right ? - Yeah . - I 'll call for an ambulance . - OK . We 're gonna get you some help , Mr Bailey . Just don 't die on me . Well , he 's alive , but he won 't be talking to us any time soon . As far as the public 's concerned , we 'll deny it ever happened . But we know better . The question is , will it happen again ? You suggest we put them all back in quarantine ? You saw what Bailey could do . And you felt it , same as me . Who knows what they rest of them are capable of ? I sure as hell don 't . But then again it 's not my job to find out . It 's yours . Aren 't you glad you wanted back in ? I never thanked you for saving my life . You know , I never shot anyone before . - Seeing him lying there like that ... - Are you OK ? I 'll get there . You know , I meant what I said to Ryland back there . Who knows where all this is going ? We 've got one case . Maybe that 's all we 'll ever have . You haven 't noticed anything unusual with Shawn ? I just need to know if you had you 'd tell me . There 's nothing to tell . Look at this guy . There 's three other sites just like this one . - What are you guys doing ? - Research . - On The 4400 Scoop . Com ? - It 's just ... You know the Web . There 's a site for everything . " The 4400 Menace ? " I know this guy . I was in quarantine with him . They 're saying he killed someone just by thinking about it . - So that makes me some kind of freak ? - No . No , we were just ... I want to know how you took Brad down so fast . - Come on , you saw it . - Danny . You have no idea what you 're talking about . Neither do you . Shawn . What ? You were thinking the same thing .

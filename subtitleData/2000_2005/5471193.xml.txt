 First time giving blood ? Yes . They pay cash here . And there 's no limit to how many times you give . They even buy it in the jar . Jared Nomak ? We 're ready for you now . In the past 12 months , have you gotten a tattoo or any skin or body piercing ? No . Where did you get that scar on your chin ? Childhood accident . You say you don 't have any immediate next of kin . Not that I 'm in contact with . Nobody to call in case of an emergency ? No one . - No family ? - I told you no . Are you telling me I can 't be a donor ? It depends . We came up with some unusual results in your blood test . What ? How unusual ? Let me explain . Your blood has a very rare phenotype , one we haven 't encountered before . What ? What are you talking about ? Who are you ? Sit down , please . What is this ? This is a good-news-bad-news scenario , Jared . Good news for us . Bad news for you . Forget what you think you know . Vampires exist . My name is Blade . I was born half-human , half-vampire . They call me the Daywalker . I have all their strengths , none of their weaknesses except for the thirst . Twenty years ago , I met a man that changed that : Whistler . He taught me how to hold the thirst at bay . Taught me the rules . Gave me the weapons to hunt with : Silver , garlic sunlight . Two years ago , he was attacked . They took him and turned him into the thing I hate most . I should 've finished him off . Now I 'm hunting him . I will find him and nothing will stand in my way . The Daywalker 's here ! Stop him ! Where is he ? Take me to him and I 'll consider you a loose end . I 'll take you ! I 'll take you ! Catch you later . Old man look at what they 've done to you . Let 's go home . Lock up your daughters , boys and girls . The Dark Knight returns . - Little toke of the smokage there , B ? - Later . Shut the lights . You found him . You didn 't kill him . Give me a hand . I have a bad feeling about this , B. Listen to his breathing . He 's already dying . He 's in pain . Why don 't we put him out of his misery ? They had him on stasis in a halfway house . I 'm giving him an accelerated retroviral detox . Like a heroin addict . Make him go cold turkey in one night . This ain 't going to work , man . I say kill the motherfucker right now . Get out . If there 's anything left of you in there , Whistler , listen up . In the morning , those blinds are going to open whether you 're cured or not . I didn 't mean to ... Listen to me , Blade . You 'll have to finish me off . No . Give me the goddamn gun . Now walk away you stupid son of a bitch . How do you feel ? Like hammered shit . How did you find me ? Started out in Moscow , then Romania . They kept moving you around . How long was I gone ? Months ? Too long . Years . They tortured me almost to death and then , let me heal in a vat of blood so they could go at it again . Sons of bitches could 've at least fixed my goddamn leg while they were at it . Where 's my arc welder ? Whistler , nice to meet you , man . I heard a lot about you . I 'm Josh , you can call me Scud , though . Everybody does . Tell me something , Skid . No , man , it 's Scud . Scud , like stud . - Scud . - Whatever . - What 'd you do in here ? - The pimpmobile ? Just a little after-market modification . Nitrous oxide , shit like that . You gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping . The whole package 'll crank that Betty up 300 horsepower . You 'll burn the thing out before your next oil change . Where 'd you dig up this shitbird ? What the fuck 's your problem , poppy ? My problem is I 've been sucking blood clots for two years and I get out to find some jerk-off fucking with my life 's work . We jeopardized our operation to save your ass ! - Our operation ? - Yeah . Our operation ? I built this operation , you asswipe ! Motion sensors ! Zone three , gentlemen ! Human ? Body temperature , 50 , I guess suckhead . Fried . They 're using magnesium flares . They got your security system scoped out . Whoa . I don 't trust you ... Fuck ! Cool outfit . God-lights . We represent the ruling body of the Vampire Nation . They 're offering you a truce . They want to meet with you . Scud . Take off your mask . My name is Asad . This is Nyssa . You have been our most feared enemy . But now there 's something else loose on the streets . Something worse than you . What 's so funny ? They tell stories about Blade , the bogeyman . Frankly , I 'm disappointed . You hear that , B ? She 's disappointed . He agreed to come along so easily . Come on , B , show her . Come on , pretty please . Semtex . Enough explosives to level a city block . You still disappointed ? Guards look human . They 're probably familiars . You sure about this ? Well , if I 'm not ... The true power of the Vampire Nation lies here . Father . Blade , this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos . It has been said , " Be proud of your enemy and enjoy his success . " In that regard , I should thank you . For what ? Eliminating Deacon Frost . You did us a favor . Karel Kounen . - You 're human . - Barely . I 'm a lawyer . European Health Consortium . As you may know , vampirism is an arbovirus carried in the saliva of predators . In 72 hours , it spreads through the human bloodstream creating new parasitic organs . Like cancer . Cancer with a purpose . Unfortunately , viruses evolve too . We 've encountered a new one . We dubbed it , " The Reaper Strain . " And like any good pathogen , it appears to have found a carrier . There , Jared Nomak . Born a vampire , but an anomaly like you . Unlike the rest of us , however he feeds on not just humans , but vampires as well . - Looks like he was doing me a favor . - You 're missing the point . Their vampire victims don 't die . They turn , they become carriers . You 've got to understand . These things are like crack addicts . They need to feed daily . Nomak 's been out for 72 hours . By our estimates , there are already a dozen Reapers . There 'll be hundreds before the week 's out . Thousands within a matter of months . Do the math . Wait , let me get this right . You want me to hunt them for you ? When they are finished with us , who do you think they 'll turn on next ? Your precious humans ? Not one of them will be left . We spent two years training a small tactical unit , the Bloodpack . We want you to lead them . Two years ? We 've been training to hunt you . - So , B , man , what do you think ? - Sounds like a plan . What do you really think ? They 'll fuck us the first chance they get . So , we ain 't going to do this , right ? We 'll play along for now . They 'll take us in deeper than we 've ever been . Get a chance to see how their world really ticks . I had enough of their world . They 're shitting bricks because they 're no longer on top of the food chain . Man , I 'm really worried about him . I know he 's your friend and all , but I think you should watch him . Nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in just one night . - Looking to get hooked up ? - Maybe . What do you have ? No problem . Horse , Hawaiian ice . Whatever you need . Whatever I need ? I like that . What if I need you ? So , so sweet . They 're ready whenever you are , Daywalker . Blade . Meet the Bloodpack . Lighthammer , Verlaine Priest Snowman Chupa and Reinhardt . Hey , me and the gang were wondering ... What was that ? Can you blush ? Here we go , papi . Oh , I get it . I see now . You 've been training for two years to take me out . And now , here I am . So exciting , isn 't it ? Okay , here 's your chance . Come on , what 're you waiting for ? Here I am , right here in front of you . Adolf here gets the first shot . What are you looking at her for ? You need permission ? Maybe you need a bit of incentive ? Okay , I can help you with that . What 's the matter ? You missed that ? I can do it again . Do you need a manual ? Do it , come on ! Now , you got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head . Silver nitrate . Rigged to go off if anybody tampers with it . I 'll have the detonator with me . And , you , if you so much as look at me wrong ... From now on , we work as a unit . You 'll be taking orders from me . Any questions ? Good . To catch the hunter , you start with the prey . We 'll target all the night places where vampires congregate . Blood banks , safe houses , bigger the better . So , what 's first ? The House of Pain . Where 's the entrance ? I don 't see any signs . No vampire glyphs . Because of you , we 've had to rethink our habits tighten our security . Have a closer look . Nice . .38 , .45 and 9mm caliber all with capsules at the tip , filled with silver nitrate , garlic extract . This hypervelocity stake gun spits out a silver stake at 6000 feet per second . Since you suckers don 't like sunlight we 've modified the gun 's entry light with UV filters . Pop it open , instant UV light . Filter 's on , no problem . Yo , B , check this out . It 's got a pneumatic syringe delivery system . The vials are filled with an anticoagulant called EDTA . One punch should blow your target up like a balloon . The cartridge ejects , automatic reload . Nice . Let 's go . - You won 't pass for one of us . - Like I give a shit . He 's right . Why don 't you post up on the roof over there , cover our backs ? So the Bloodpack 's calling the shots now ? Great . Curb that dog of yours , or we 'll do it for you . Keep pushing , asshole . We 're in . You 're about to enter our world . You will see things , feeding . Just remember why you 're here . I haven 't forgotten . What are we looking for in here ? Anything that looks suspicious . You got to be kidding me . Scud , do you read me ? - Scud , do you read me ? - Read you loud and clear , B. Whole place is a safe house . Windows are painted black , one access door . - Two , three hundred suckheads here . - That sounds cool . Hey , W , you got me ? W ? How 's the weather up there , sweetheart ? Walking on sunshine , toke-boy . Look at them . Half of these bastards , they 're not even purebloods . I tell you what . Why don 't we just fucking kill everyone ? Just to make sure . God , it 'd be so easy . He 's got you . Fuck you . Daywalker . Mother 's milk . I 'd say we got about half an hour till sunrise , Cinderellas , so hurry up . I spotted one but lost him . Be on the lookout . Fuck . There was something on the roof of my bus . Nomak . Daywalker . What am I to you ? Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my enemy ? We 're under attack . There 's three of them , probably more . Daylight . Silver don 't do shit . Don 't waste bullets . Motherfucker . You hear me , Chupa ? Say cheese ! Get off ! How about some daylight , motherfucker ? Fuck ! No , no , no . If you 're under attack , use your UV lights . They can 't take the light . Priest . We 're not dying here , man . Come on . Priest is down . Daylight 's coming . You 're on your own , Blade . You want me so bad , Blade . Here I am . Why kill me ? You and I , we have the same enemy . We want the same thing . We need the same thing . What happened ? Why didn 't you tell me they were immune to silver and garlic ? I didn 't know . If you did , would you have told me ? I think you know the truth when you hear it . Then why didn 't he kill you ? - How long since he 's been bitten ? - About 20 minutes . - His skin is fucking burning . - He 's already starting to change . Will someone shut him the fuck up ? ! Hold on . Hold him , Chupa . Just put him out of his fucking misery ! You can 't finish him that way ! Hold him down . Hold him down , Chupa . Move . Back off ! Back off ! If that was your Bloodpack Sunday punch , we 're in trouble . This motherfucker left his post . He just disappeared . Where were you ? Ran into a little Reaper action myself . Oh , yeah ? How little ? We lost a man . Priest . Want me to carve his fucking name on your chest ? Saw movement in the alley and followed it . Found it just like this . I think they came through here . He was trying to crawl back into the culvert . Caught his arm . Been gnawing at it like a coyote . Little Boy Blue . It 's already dying . I need to examine it as quickly as possible . Okay , look for a lever . Let 's open it . They 've made contact with the Reapers . - Any casualties ? - One so far . It was not ... Nyssa , I trust . No . This is a dangerous game you 're playing , Damaskinos . Blade is too volatile . You 're not going to be able to keep manipulating him . You worry too much . I 've been informed by our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted . You 've already lost one of your own . How many are you willing to sacrifice ? Everyone ? Even your own daughter ? Yes . Even her . Recognize this ? - The blood bank . He 's one of the guards . So why is he dying ? What 's killing him ? Time . His metabolism is burning too fast . They need fresh blood every few hours , or they 'll start feeding on themselves . Nomak 's different . He 's the carrier . It all started with him . It 'll end with him . Open the mouth , Scud . Open the mouth . B , come on . Sissy . God . Only the tongue carries the virus . It is injected through these barbs . It has bifurcated masseter muscles overdeveloped , allowing for a much stronger bite . Jaw structure remains the same , but there is no mandible bone . Squeeze that tooth , Scud . Neurotoxin . Probably paralyze their victim while they feed . Garlic don 't work . Silver , that don 't work . - We got to go with the sunlight , right ? - That 's deadly to us too . Let 's see what else we can find . These things are as different from us as we are from you . Look at that . The heart is encased in bone . Only the side is vulnerable . Good luck getting a stake through that . Pull a leg off a spider , it keeps moving on its own essentially trying to walk without a body attached to it . - What the fuck are you doing ? - Hard-wired , right ? What the fuck is that ? Brain 's dead . Body 's still trying to feed . We got six hours before sunrise . Be ready by then . Hey . What happens at sunrise ? Blade , I 'm talking to you . What happens at sunrise ? We hunt . - In broad daylight ? - You got to be fucking joking . Better get you some sunscreen , buttercup . Listen , shitkicker , you 're about one cunt hair away from hillbilly heaven . I love it when you talk dirty . Sunlight 's the only edge we 've got . They 'll be more vulnerable then . And so will we . Let 's be real about one thing : I don 't expect everybody to make it back . Remember to protect yourselves at all times . - What are you looking for ? - Phosphor rods . If I can suss out the light source maybe I can make some sort of UV flash-bang grenade . Been tried already . But you didn 't have the Scudster working on it then , did you ? - The way you talked to them , us ... - What is it ? We are together in this , remember ? Why do you hate us so much ? It 's fate . - It 's in my blood . - Well , it 's in mine too . I 'm a pureblood . I was born a vampire . You know the thirst better than any of us . Shooting that serum of yours . The only difference between us is that I made peace with what I am long ago . - So how long you known Blade , anyway ? - Going on 20 years . He doesn 't talk about the old days much . Blade doesn 't talk about anything much . You want to hear something funny ? Blade kind of looks at you like a father figure . Tell me something . How 'd you two hook up ? I was backpacking , met these two chicks . Decided to take them back to my tent for a little Three 's Company action . Pretty . Next thing you know , Janet and Chrissy start tearing chunks out of my stomach . Blade shows up , saves my ass . Everything else sort of fell into place . - Let 's try it . - All right . Maybe I fucked up . Maybe you were right . All right . Papa 's got a brand-new bag . Let me ask one question : How are we going to find these Reapers ? We won 't have to . They 'll come to us . - What is this shit ? - Pheromones . Harvested from the Reaper 's adrenal glands . They 're going to key to it . They want us to spray on some suck-puppy 's nut juice ? First use your firearms to drive them back . Then toss your UV grenades . This we got for the grand finale . I hot-wired a couple of these babies to a nitro vacuum . Just be real careful where you pop your load , all right ? - And you ? You 're not coming ? - No . I 'm a lover , not a fighter . UVs have a ten-second delay . Just remember to take cover . Give me a hand . You and Miss Muffet getting a little cozy there . I wouldn 't worry about that if I was you . Looks to me like you 're getting confused as to which side of the line you 're on . Hollow words coming from a man who spent two years running with the enemy . And what the hell 's that supposed to mean ? You know , Whistler , there 's an old saying : Keep your friends close . Keep your enemies closer . You might want to remember that . Blade , we should split in three units . We 're trying to attract them , not scare them off . Some of us can 't see in the dark , you fucking nipplehead . What am I supposed to do ? Bifocals , Grandpa . Try to keep up . Let 's do this . Hey , hillbilly . The fuck you doing ? Ain 't nobody here but you and us , buttercup . We lose a partner and Blade loses one . I 'll leave you two lovebirds some time to yourselves . I spotted a group in the east tunnel . I 'm prepping the bomb pack . Get out ! Right now . No ! No ! Let go ! I 'll attract them to me . Do what I tell you . Move ! Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one . Piece of junk . What the hell is this ? Trying to stink me to death , old man ? Wait ! - You okay ? - Yeah . We got to move . We got a lot of company . All units regroup . Regroup ! Eat shit , you ugly motherfuckers ! There 's nobody there ! - Where 's the bomb pack ? - I had to leave it down that tunnel . Give me the rest of the pheromones . Go down that tunnel ! Go ! Go , go , go , go ! You obviously do not know who you are fucking with ! By the way , Blade , did I mention the bomb lever 's stuck ? Suck this ! Let 's go ! You want a bite of me ? Well , come on ! Come on , motherfucker ! No ! No ! Whistler . Wait . You will survive this only to tell Blade about this ring . About the truth . The truth , old man . Damaskinos neglected to tell Blade ... You 've done a great job . Not that great , I 'd say . What is it , my daughter ? They took them . All our weapons . Even your sword . Somebody 's been keeping tabs on us from inside . Where are we ? Some kind of chamber , deep in their lair . They smashed up everything . The workshop , all of it . They 've been lying to us from day one . The Reaper strain didn 't evolve . It was designed . - What ? - Designed . Nomak told me . I saw him back in the sewers . He let me live . Did he ? How generous of him . I brought you here to see the fruits of our labor . For years , I 've struggled to rid our kind of any hereditary weaknesses . So , recombining DNA was simply the next logical step . Nomak was the first . A failure . But , in time there 'll be a new pure race , begotten from my own flesh . Immune to silver . Soon , even sunlight . I got a question for you , you lying son of a bitch . You want to explain how Nomak got ahold of this ring ? I would have thought it was obvious at this point . I gave it to him , of course . A gift , from father to son . I thought he 'd never leave . The wolf has lain with the sheep long enough . Reinhardt , you can kiss your ass goodbye . I 'm sorry , man . B , you 're wasting your time , man . The bomb 's a dud . It wasn 't supposed to explode . It was supposed to make you feel in control . Thought you had me on a short leash , didn 't you , Jefe ? Much better . See this ? I 'm one of Damaskinos ' familiars . They needed my help to bring you here to control Nomak . The old fuck was always just bait . Look at him . He 's your only real weakness , man . You may be fast , strong and all that other bullshit , but in the end , B you 're just too human . Well , you little shit . You think they scoped out my security system ? I let them in , asshole ! I practically handed them the keys ! You heard cue ball , right ? Pretty soon , they 're all going to be Daywalkers , man . When that happens , I 'd rather be a pet than cattle . You got me , B ? - What do you think about that , man ? - Two things . One , I 've been onto you since they turned you . And two it 's not a dud . Oh , great . I was just starting to like him . Take him down ! We 're going to harvest your blood . Every drop of it . Then bone marrow , organs , everything . We 'll find the missing key to creating Daywalkers . Now , this might hurt a bit . Nice . I wonder ... how many vampires he 's killed with this thing . Not nearly enough , Fritz . Keep talking , honkytonk . It just makes my sending you to the next world all the sweeter . Been there . Done that . Do your worst , chickenshit . We 'll settle up after . What else should I find out ? I trusted you with my men my will and my life . You . You sent us out there . You sent me to die . Our enemy saved my life twice , and you have used us . Your own children . Make no mistake , Nyssa . Blood ties mean nothing when measured against the ascendancy of our race . Who do you think God really favors in the web ? The spider or the fly ? Nomak . What about him ? He wants revenge on the people who created him . You may be right . But fortunately for us , he doesn 't know this location . Now he does . What the fuck ? Come on , kid . Don 't you even think about dying on me . You didn 't give up on me , I won 't give up on you . Come on . Blood . Yeah . Blood . Father ! He 'll never enter here . Father ! Father ! Go on , kid . Go ! Get in there ! Well , like my daddy said before he killed my mom : " Want anything done right , you got to do it yourself . " He also said ... Can you blush ? Hey , kid . I reset the security code . We 're locked in . Are you insane ? ! - He 'll kill us both . - Yes Isn 't it sad that you die , not by the hand of your enemy but by that of your own children ? Father . It could end right here . What do you think ? After all , it looks like I 'll finish my father 's job . It 's strange . It hurts ... It hurts no more . It won 't be long . I can already feel it burning inside of me . I want to die while I 'm still a vampire . I want to see the sun . dancing in the Nude Buddy booth number three . Enjoy , man . Are you sure that the girls are live ? Last time I check . Thank you . Couple of razor blades . Just in case . You didn 't think I forgot about you , did you ?

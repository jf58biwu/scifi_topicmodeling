 Are you sure he 's going to come ? Hope so . Don 't want to disappoint a big shot reporter like you . I 've really got to get some great pictures of him . lo , do you read me ? Roger , loud and clear . Clockwise 1 8 degrees . Okay . - What 's that on the monitor ? - Density changes in the plasma . Careful , lo . It expresses voltage regulation . What he means is that when a charge fluctuation occurs ... the plasma above the earth 's surface is induced to the ground . The plasma and the tremor in the ground become linked . - ln short , a seismometer . - Plasma ? You mean , like blood ? You really are an imbecile . Imbecile ? In imbecile terms , if there is any fluctuation ... that means Godzilla 's in the area . It 's starting , isn 't it ? Yeah , right . It seems so . We still can 't contact the Ocean Queen . Is it possible something is interfering with their transmissions ? Could be. I 'll keep trying . Over and out . The damn teriyaki 's cold again . But as long as the beer is cold , who cares ? If you clowns don 't like it , there 's plenty of other places ... to eat around here , so shut up or get out . If you 're frightened , get down . I 'm okay , but aren 't you worried about your daughter ? No . She worries about me . Hang on . No , too close . Faster ! Dad , come on ! Let 's go ! - Thank you for coming , sir . - Thank you . Not everyone can be head of the CCl at 3 2 . Excuse me , sir . It 's about the meteorite . Would you excuse me ? - They 've reached it ? - Yes , sir . - How far down is it ? - Just under 900 fathoms . Start surfacing procedures immediately . The whole area 's fogbound , sir . We 'll have to wait till tomorrow morning . Come on ! lo , keep that antenna steady ! - Does that help any ? - And I 'm the imbecile ? Touch√© . So why don 't you take some pictures ? That 's what you came here for , right ? God must be punishing me for being ambitious . All right . You 're sure you 've still got film in the camera ? Bite me ! Look out ! Godzilla ! Look out ! Godzilla ! Incredible . Looks like he 's trying to destroy our energy sources . Last surfacing unit is in position . Depth : 5,300 . Right rudder 1 0 degrees . Unbelievable ! It 's like a forest of volcanoes . What 's that ? You promised you 'd put me on hard news if I shot Godzilla at Nemuro ! Now , come on ! Did you look at these first ? These negatives are as blank as your mind . Godzilla 's radiation fogged the film . Next time , don 't get so close . Now , go and try again . Not another joyride with those freaks . - Quit your bitching . - They 're a pain in the ass . Kimura , is that you ? - Shinoda here . - Yeah , go ahead . About this data you just sent me . Amazing , huh ? The temperature of the water off Kinkazan ... is up 38 degrees in the past two hours . Excuse me. I 'm looking for the Godzilla Prediction Network . - Oh , sure . - Yeah . Down that hallway , take the first left . - Right ? - Okay . Then when you get to the end , turn right . Left , then right . Got it . - Who told you to stop working ? - No one . - So you got it ? - Yeah . First left , then right . - Right . Got it . - Great . - Thanks . - What ? If you wanna work with us , you have to join . " Membership : 200,000 yen plus 50,000 a month " ? - What is this , the imbecile rate ? - We are like a collective . We share the financial risk up front . Then we profit from the information we acquire . Look , I 'm not interested in joining your little clubhouse , see ? I just wanna take some more pictures , okay ? You wanna take pictures , you 'll have to become a member . - Hey , a little help here . - l 'm in charge of the business end . However , we do have an alternative plan . Half off if you agree to share expenses . The meteorite is highly magnetic . The material could be the first step toward finding ... a new and more efficient source of energy . Excellent . Any reduction in the use of fossil fuels ... would be a real feather in CCl 's cap . All balloons ready . Aqualift system , stand by . Stand by to commence lifting . Roger . All ships commence lifting . It 's going up too fast ! What the hell 's happening ? What the- - I don 't hear the cabbage being chopped . - Supper 's ready . - All right . Thanks . GPN Center . Hold on , please . It 's outpost 2031 . That 'll be Sonora . I 've been analyzing some new tremors . And right now ... it looks like he 's moving south . Let me give you a hand . Spotted him again ? Yeah . Give me a push here . There you go . Geez , you stink . No , your breath . - See you tomorrow . - Later , baby . Bye . Hello , it 's Yuki . You mean you know where he is ? - Thank you , sir . - Sharing expenses my ass ! Well , I sure as hell ain 't paying for gas . Unit One , stand by . Unit Two , cease drilling . We 've drilled several holes into the rock ... but we keep hitting something solid , so we 've stopped for now . Give me a guess on its age . The best estimate so far is 60 , 7 0 million years . What about its buoyancy ? Well , possibly it 's hollow . And it did surface of its own will somehow . Meaning what ? It could be a vessel ... from outer space . Mr. Secretary , come in . Katagiri . Yes , of course . - l 'm on my way . - Godzilla ? They just spotted him moving south near Ibaraki . You stay here for now . New Godzilla reading . He 's moving inward toward Tokai . The nuclear plants . I knew it . Afraid so . Well , that 's just lovely . Another Chernobyl . This is Katagiri of Crisis Control . Godzilla is heading for Tokai as we speak . Shut down all your reactors immediately . Are you crazy ? I don 't have the authority . You do now . And as head of the Crisis Control Agency ... I 'm giving you authorization . Now shut down those reactors ! Red alert ! Red alert ! Shut down all reactors immediately ! This is not a drill ! Godzilla is headed for Tokai on the east coast of Ibaraki . The government is holding an emergency cabinet meeting ... and they 're sending the army to the presumed landing spot . Don 't you think this is a little too close ? I need to be as close as possible . If you don 't like it , go home and watch it on TV . - Katagiri didn 't waste any time . - Katagiri ? Deputy Secretary of the lnterior , head of the CCl . Hello , Shinoda . It 's been a long time . Not long enough . I 'd hoped never to see you again . I know . You and Miyasaka were a fine team . You should 've come with him when I established CCl . Not in a thousand years . I could never work for a man like you . Why not ? We both have the same goals . Boy , that 's a real laugh . Godzilla needs to be studied . He 's a gold mine of knowledge . But you couldn 't care less . You just want to kill him before we fully analyzed him . And in the meantime , he just levels Tokyo . Of course not . That 's why I created the Network . He must be contained . I realize that . But it 's worth the effort . I 'll tell you what . Join the Network . You might learn something . Your Network 's history . I 'll send flowers . Shutting down the reactors isn 't enough ! You have to kill all energy sources ! General Takada of the First Division . I was told to report to you , sir . Bastard . You really think you can kill Godzilla ? It 's moving ! Group Two in position and ready . Over . Roger , Group Two . Stand by . As we know from experience ... when Godzilla is attacked he advances instead of retreats . We can make use of his aggressiveness ... by luring him to the mouth of the river . And what happens once he gets there ? - The underwater mines will do the rest . - Mines ? What about the safety of the local residents ? Ah , yes . Well , I 'm not saying we wouldn 't get our hair mussed ... but I can promise no more than 200 , 300 tops . I don 't like it . And if the mines fail to stop him , then what ? We 've developed an advanced new weapon ... a new generation of armor-piercing missile . It 's so powerful , it can penetrate any known material . I guarantee it 'll go through Godzilla like crap through a goose . So , what now ? You and lo go to a safe distance . - What about you ? - l 'm waiting for Godzilla . Katagiri 's determined to kill him . That sound can mean only one thing- - Godzilla . He 's coming . Get going ! Locked on target . Fire at will . Wait till he gets closer . Fire ! All units , pull back ! Missiles one , two and three , fire ! I was right . It 's following the sun . If it keeps- - Don 't just stand there ! Move the boat ! Target in sight . Engaging now . A call for you , sir . - Katagiri . - It 's Miyasaka . The rock 's gone ! It just flew away ! I picked this up for next to nothing . - Yuki will love it . - lf she 's still speaking to you . Holy crap ! Did you see that flying rock go by ? It 's unbelievable ! Therefore ... Therefore ... I 'm convinced that this vessel comes from another galaxy . A visitor from outer space ? My God , it 's just too crazy to believe . Right . Like Godzilla 's normal . Anyway , it 's my theory that it draws its energy from light . When it landed , it sank in the ocean where sunlight couldn 't reach it . Until yesterday , when the research sub ... beamed its lights on it , and it woke up . What we must know : is it dangerous to mankind ? It 's dangerous to Godzilla . That 's for sure . I 've never seen anything with that kind of power before . But it 's been inactive since the sun went down . Maybe , but we can 't take chances . I want a full set of diagnostics . If an alien is still alive in there ... I wanna know more about it . What about Godzilla ? Nothing so far . The air force is still sweeping the area . I 'm sorry . This area is closed . All units , keep 300 meters from target . Sensors in scanning mode . Stand by . Over . Begin sensor scanning . I wonder what it 's up to now . You and me both . I 'd love to know what 's in there . I 'd love to know about its power source . It could be centuries before we came up with something close to this . Hey , Professor , a call for you . Yes , Miyasaka . What ? That was Shinoda . He wants to see us . He wants to use our equipment to examine a Godzilla skin sample . - Sir , any comment on the space ship ? - Not at the moment . The minute we know something , we 'll let you know . Thank you . Any idea when that will be , sir ? Sir ? Sir ? So we 're on a first name basis now , are we ? Come with me . I have to collect some materials ... and you can get some photos , okay ? Fine , but I 'm still not paying for gas . - That 's odd . - What ? My laptop came on by itself . You sure you didn 't just leave it on ? - Yeah . - l wouldn 't worry about it . Come on . To be blunt , you 're the last man I 'd ask for a favor . And you think the sample 's that important ? I wouldn 't have come here otherwise . You can use the CCl equipment on two conditions . You share all the data you found and you fully abide by our rules . It 's a deal . Come on . We 're going back to Tokyo . Some data was hacked from my computer ... from the Godzilla file . It doesn 't make sense . If the data 's been read , the entire Network 's at risk . No kidding . Better bring the yellow disk with you , just in case . I have a ton of summer homework to do . Are you gonna help me with it ? Of course I will . Okay , see you in half an hour . These are photos of the Godzilla skin sample I found in Tokai . The first one shows clear signs of scar damage ... but the second one is completely clear . Same piece of skin ? Yeah . The photos were taken only five hours apart . That 's a remarkable healing speed . Look . Every layer of skin , every cell , every blood vessel- - They 're all intact . What a creature . It 's invincible ! The question is , how can all these cells regenerate ? Maybe it has something to do with his radioactive properties . - Let 's try the electron microscope . - Okay . Look at that . How does he manage to regenerate his cells so quickly ? Cell recovery and reformation . Even with the simplest life-forms , we 've never been able to do that . It 's like watching the process of creation . In a way , we 're its godparents . You discovered it . You ought to name it . You really think so ? Regenerator G1 . - The clouds are clearing , sir . - Yes , I know . But that thing 's tied down with electromagnetic cables . Even if it wakes up , it 's not going anywhere . If Regenerator G1 is the secret of Godzilla 's healing ability ... then we 're on to something monumental . It could revolutionize modern medicine . If we could find a way to use it for humans . You know , Godzilla could be full of such discoveries . I feel like we 're back together at the university . Why did you resign ? I couldn 't take it anymore . It had gotten too unethical . We were doing the research for all the wrong reasons . Come in . Excuse me , sir . There 's an lo Shinoda here to see you . Did you bring them ? Those things were unbreakable ! Are you up to your tricks again ? I couldn 't let them destroy our Network . But they 'll find out soon enough . They 're your own disks , right ? - Do we run ? - Yeah . The UFO just flew away again ! How could it still be alive after so long ? It must have been in suspended animation . I just can 't conceive of any life-form ... that could survive for 60 million years . Good Lord . I just hope it 's friendly . All six crew members perished in the attack . What alien space vessel ? - Great Caesar 's ghost ! - What is it ? Everybody , get out ! No ! I gotta get some pictures ! No time , sister ! Let 's get out of here ! Stop pulling me ! - What the hell 's the matter with you ? - lt 's the scoop of the century ! Close off all streets around City Tower . - Evacuate everyone in there , now ! - Right away , sir . Go , go , go ! Come on , baby ! Let 's go ! Move , move , move ! Let 's go , soldier ! On the double ! Move it ! Now that we know it 's hostile ... we must do whatever we can to destroy it quickly . Thank God it 's going to be dark soon . That gives us a few hours to plan a course of action . What 's tomorrow 's forecast ? Sunny and clear . We can 't wait till then . We 've got to destroy that thing tonight . When 's it gonna do something ? Yeah , we 've been waiting all day ! The alien vessel remains motionless atop the city tower . But where is Godzilla ? That is the question . As you can see , all traffic and transport facilities ... to this district are halted . The area around the city tower is completely blocked off , a no-go zone . On the premises of the city tower , still waiting for what we consider- - This really is incredible . It 's like a scene from an old sci-fi movie . The giant flying saucer appeared in the sky above Tokyo ... and is perched atop City Tower ... completely immobile , looking down on us , as if to challenge mankind ... for rulership of this planet . Again ? Why does this keep happening ? All computers in the Shinjuku district have gone down , sir . - lsolate our main computer . - Yes , sir . Sir , the anti-hacking program has crashed too ! And the main computer at KDL has also gone down ! What the hell is this ? - Try the infrared filter . - Yes , sir . I 'll be damned . It 's hacking City Tower 's supercomputer . It 'll soak up every last bit of data ! Use the linkage tracer to visualize the access route . Mr. Secretary . At this rate , all oftokyo 's data could be gone in a few hours . I can 't believe it . This could be the end of our civilization . You really call this civilization ? Anything we don 't understand we try to destroy . And CCl- - ground zero for that kind of lunacy . We 're all gonna die , and I 'm part of the reason ! Aren 't I ? - Engineers have just left , sir . - Good . How long do you need to set up the bombs ? - Half hour , tops . - And to pull out ? Ten minutes . That ought to be plenty . Well , it 's about time I got through . - Yuki ? - Yeah . Guess where I am . In a few minutes , I should know what they 're after . Now listen ! Get out of there immediately ! You hear me ? - Katagiri 's up to something . - Are you crazy ? No way I 'm gonna leave now . We gotta know why they 're interested in Godzilla . I 'll call you back later . Are you there ? Yuki ! I 'm going to strangle that imbecile . We 're on the 51 st floor . Bomb 's moving into place . Hey , stop ! Let us go ! Please ! My mommy 's in the tower ! We have to save her ! Listen to me . Her mother 's in the building . Understand ? Let us through ! - You can 't go in , Professor . - Why not ? The whole place is gonna blow in ten minutes . - What ? - Katagiri 's orders . Come on ! - Come on ! We got to get out ! Now ! - l think I know what the aliens want . There 's no more time . The whole building 's coming down in ten minutes ! - Go on . Move ! - What about you ? I can do this faster than you . Go find a guard and ask him to tell Katagiri to postpone the blast . Hurry up ! Dad , don 't be too long , okay ? I promise , sweetie . All right . Here we go . Bomb 's in place . All units pulling out now . Detonation at 21 : 1 0 precisely . Check . Detonation at 21 : 1 0 . All units . Detonation at 21 : 1 0 . - Radio . - Sir . Two people are still inside the tower , sir . Who gave them access ? I did , sir . Clear the area immediately . No delays . Come back ! - Stop . - Yes , sir . Don 't blow up the building yet ! My dad 's on the 48th floor ! Contact Katagiri and tell him to delay the blast ! There 's still a man in the building . Postpone the detonation . Proceed as instructed . It 's Shinoda in there , sir . Looks like I 'm gonna have to send more flowers . Too late . We gotta go . Follow me . - Daddy ! - lo , wait ! Let me go ! I 've gotta save him ! No , it 's too late . You can 't go in there . Don 't do it ! It 's a dead end . I hear something . Daddy ! Nice try , asshole . See here ? They want to change our atmosphere ... to make it more suitable to their living conditions . They want to build their own empire on Earth . But they need more information . Look at this . Why are they so interested in Godzilla ? Give me your pin box , lo . I don 't get it . Something without form ... can take on another one . Regenerator G1 ? Godzilla 's entered the bay . What if we just shut down all the electrical generators ? If there 's no power , maybe he 'll just go away . - No , it 's no use . - l think Shinoda 's right . There 's only one thing on Godzilla 's mind right now . Look ! What 's that ? The tentacles again ! Look at that . It 's Regenerator G1 . What 's going on ? It 's Regenerator G1 . He 's using it to adapt to our atmosphere . Get the fire extinguishers ! Hurry ! Look at that . It 's trying to become a Godzilla clone . Boy , that 's ironic . It woke up after 60 million years ... and then Godzilla destroyed it the very next day . Yeah . Godzilla 's coming ! - Look out ! - Run ! Get out of here ! Hurry ! Come on ! Run ! I 've never seen Godzilla this close before . - Come on ! - Leave me ! Daddy ! Godzilla ! We scientists produced this monster . Godzilla . And ever since ... we 've tried to destroy him . But then why ? Why does he keep protecting us ? Maybe because ... Godzilla is inside each one of us .

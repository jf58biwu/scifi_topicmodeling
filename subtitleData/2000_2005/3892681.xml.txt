 All the way to the top of a bloody mountain to see what ... we already know . We are surrounded by clouds ... in a world that doesn 't exist . Oh it exists all right , just not as we first imagined it . And somehow those clouds of mist and vapor they 're the key to it . All we have to do is get to them . Which shouldn 't take too long ? You 'd be happy to spend the rest of your life doing this , wouldn 't you ? Oh as long as I can be with you . Words , Roxton . You are far too independent to be my lapdog ... although I do appreciate the effort . Curious thing is , no matter which direction we travel , those clouds never seem to be any closer . Wow that was a big one . Looks like we 're in for it . Looks like they 're gonna get wet . If this keeps up we could be stuck here all night . Hope you don 't mind going out for fire wood if we are ? Yes , then we can sit around the campfire and tell scary stories . That novelty wore off a long time ago . What was that ? What stopped the rain ? Summerlee ? It can 't be . Well can 't you see me ? I can 't understand you . No come back . Summerlee ? Come back ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Well I had quite a dream last night . Well I dreamt someone was cold and she kept ... sending me out for firewood . No , that actually happened . And I joined you on a couple of those excursions . Pity you didn 't find something for breakfast . I dreamt about Summerlee . So did I ! what a coincidence ! Our adventure with the Manuins . That 's what I dreamt about . Summerlee pulled Roxton and I out of that horrible cave . And saved my wretched hide as well ... strange that we should both dream about the same thing . What about you , did you dream about Summerlee ? I might have been thinking about him as I listened to you snore . - That was Challenger . - Well it could have been both of us . Well I mean we both dreamt about the same thing . I don 't snore . I wonder what triggered it . Could have something to do with that dark empty cave . Couldn 't have been . - Malone ? - Malone are you here ? We 're hungry ... and I could use a bath . Malone ? He 's gone looking for ghosts . What ? I know it sounds crazy but Summerlee 's ... ghost was here in the treehouse . I 'm going after him . Don 't worry ... Malone . A ghost ? I knew we shouldn 't have left him alone with these books for two days . He must have seen something to send him off into the jungle . Maybe he had dream about Summerlee like we did . Dreams and ghosts aren 't the same . Whatever he 's chasing I 'm sure he 'll find his way back ... - once he comes to his senses . - Maybe we should go and look for him . No , he can 't be very far away . Then it won 't take long to find him . He could be in some kind of trouble Marguerite , and this is a bit out of character for him . Challenger 's right , the sooner we find him the sooner we can relax . All right , I 'll write Veronica a note . Malone and his damn imagination . Looks like he 's left a trail for us . How thoughtful . What 's bothering you ? Malone sees a ghost now we 're all trying to track it down . We 're not looking for ghosts we 're trying to find Malone . And since when don 't you believe in ghosts anyway ? Didn 't your brother 's ghost come and visit you once ? That was in a cave filled with hallucinogenic fungus . Roxton ? What is it ? I also dreamt that Summerlee saved me last night . What ! You dreamt about that as well ? Challenger did you hear that ? We all dreamt about the same thing . That is a remarkable incidence of probability . We haven 't been talking about Summerlee , have we ? That still doesn 't explain what Malone 's up to . Where are you Summerlee ? Ah this is crazy . Summerlee wait come back . Hello . Anybody home ? Looks like he 's got company . Yeah two of them . Too heavy for ghosts I think . Orinoco cannibals , this is their territory . What 's Malone doing here ? I just hope he knows he 's being followed . They stop here . Probably lost his trail now that he 's stopped marking it . Look . Let 's hope that 's not Malone they 're cooking . They 're not cooking anything . Why would they stop to light a fire ? Ambush ! Looks like they got us all . That was a nasty hit you took for me ... thanks . The pleasure is theirs I 'm sure . What 's the big discussion about ? They 're trying to decide which one of us to dine on first . They think I 'd be the most tender . Well , they obviously don 't know you very well . Not that I 'm discouraging from their excellent choice of appetizer . There 's a strong contingent pushing for you ... the most virile source of great power . Powerful heartburn , I 'll guarantee them that . Challenger , looks like you 're going to outlive both of us . Old and tough , it 's an acquired taste . Now where 's Summerlee 's pipe when you need it ? Summerlee 's pipe ? Well the last time we were ambushed by cannibals ... they were so fascinated by his pipe ... we packed it full of gunpowder and let them smoke it . I remember you telling me about that . It 's too bad I left my pipe back at the treehouse . And all of our gunpowder is actually over there . Looks like tender it is . If you were a gentleman you 'd volunteer . What did you say ? I told them I 'm cursed , that if they eat me they die . Well tell them we 're all cursed Marguerite . He said a little bit will give him power over the curse . Hoisted on your own petard . What do you think they mean by a little bit ? I 'd rather not find out . Help me , damn it ! Any time you 're ready guys . Maybe they 'll start with just a finger . No ! What are you doing ! No , not my arm ! That is just plain greedy . Nicely timed as always George . Crude but effective I suppose . Thank you for saving my arm . You 're more than the sum of all your parts Marguerite , but only if you keep them all together . - For you I 'll try . - I 'd like that . We better find a safe place to camp for tonight . Try and pick up Malone 's trail at daybreak . Do we have to stay in cannibal territory ? We 've already killed their chief , they 've got plenty to chew on for a while . Let 's go . Let them dine in peace . Where are they ? What were you doing reading Summerlee 's journal . Boo . Did I scare you ? I was listening for cannibals . Oh , yeah . More like seeing ghosts . Quite a coincidence ... all of us having the same dream like that . I 'm sorry that it brought back so many bad memories about your brother . All I keep seeing is the look in his eyes when I shot him . You shot the ape that would have killed him . It was tragic that the bullet killed your brother as well but it wasn 't your fault . That 's what I keep telling myself . But one thought one word ... wherever I go whatever I do the past is always there . Even here . You know if only I could put enough ... time and space between then and now , wouldn 't that make a difference ? Shouldn 't I be able to start again ? Where would you begin ? You don 't think it 's possible anymore than I do . No you 're right , but it is something that we all seem to have in common . That urge to escape the past ... start again ... fresh and new . Thank you . Malone ? Challenger ? Is that you ? Summerlee ? What ? What are you saying ? No , no , no , no , no , don 't go . Another bad night 's sleep . At least we weren 't interrupted by cannibals looking for dessert . Did either of you dream about Summerlee again last night ? - No , I didn 't . - Nor I. I don 't know what I dreamt about , but I know I didn 't like it . Oh ! So much for staying fresh . Hallelujah . Summerlee ? What 's a German aircraft doing up here ? - Do you see that ? - Yeah . This plane didn 't land itself . What on earth is this ? - Step aside . - Oh ! What are you doing ? You can 't shoot her . If you kill her and I won 't start the plane . Arthur don 't . I refuse to spin the props so you may as well shoot me now . Arthur . Fire away . What was that , a dream or a ghost ? It was my memory . Summerlee saved my life . That 's right , when that German bi-plane landed here and the pilot wanted to kill you . This is incredible . It 's like a window into past events , images frozen in time . - But how ? - I don 't know ... but it must be connected with those dreams we had ... and it all started with that storm . You 're saying it all has to do with the weather ? I miss you Professor . I miss you very much . You 're still here . No , no , don 't go . Looks like Malone may have ducked in her to dodge the cannibals . You don 't think he 's still in there do you ? There may be an exit somewhere else . After you . Looks deep . It goes right back into the hill side . More to the point , are there any predators ? Malone 's canteen . - Full of water . - So , where is he ? He wouldn 't have left that here on purpose . Let 's check it out further . Malone , you in there ? Malone ? He must be experiencing these memories just as we are . That 's probably what lured him out of the treehouse . Please no more reminiscing today , my morale can 't stand it . Well that settles that . He came back the same way as he came in . Without his canteen ? Sooner or later he 's going to have to realize he 's lost it . Unless he 's in trouble . Why did you lead me here ? There 's no water here . Summerlee ? Are you listening to me ? He must have come to his senses by now . There 's a very strange energy about . Maybe he 's following it to its source . Well he might have picked an easier path . - Sounds like our favorite carnivore . - Back to the cave . Oh I hate that place . Better than the belly of a T-Rex . I 'll distract it . Marguerite ! Quickly ! I sure hope Malone is having this much fun . He 's heading into dangerous territory . Oh , looks like this happy camper is not gonna give up that easily . Maybe some cannibals will come along and save us . Oh , don 't leave me now . - Where are you taking me ? - A shortcut Veronica . A shortcut ? A shortcut where ? You 'd think we 're the only entrée in the jungle . Maybe he 's acquired a taste for human flesh . Then one of you go outside and feed it and I can go back to the treehouse . I believe I may have a solution . Who said that ? What are you doing ? Let him out . I 'm afraid that is the bargain . Yura felt that you would be more help in hunting Lento than I. Another memory ? - They 're not going to hang you . - Oh yes , that is the idea . Summerlee I can 't let you die because of me . Then I suggest you hurry . That was when Summerlee stepped in to save Malone . He ended up delivering a baby . Summerlee to the rescue once again . Just a minute , as I recall ... this event happened after the encounter with the German pilot . - What are you saying Challenger ? - Events in chronological order . Our dream in the cave , now that was first then the German pilot . I 'm sorry Marguerite , now this . These are more than memories . We are experiencing a replay of Summerlee 's life here on the plateau . Talk about a trip down memory lane . That 's far too eerie for me . Sorry to spoil your dinner plans boys . Gotta keep moving . Summerlee where are you taking me ? Looks like it 's gone . About time . Malone will be miles ahead of us by now . He 's moving about all over the place . His pace is erratic also , sometimes walking , sometimes running . Maybe he 's running from that T-Rex that was hunting us . Look out ! Look out ! Run Summerlee ! Come on , come on , come on . Is it really gone ? Well , thankfully that one was imaginary . But when did this happen , was it before or after the previous one ? After I think . That was the angry female that came after ... Summerlee for tampering with her eggs . Now weren 't you just talking about T-Rex 's ? - I might have mentioned it . - Then maybe these ... these memories are triggered by the power of suggestion . No , the memories came first ... right after the storm . It 's as if some switch just turned them on . Summerlee ? Over here my child . I can 't see you , where ? Seems I still can 't get it right . You can hear me but now you can 't see me . Where are you ? What happened to you ? Don 't you remember ? I went over those blasted falls . So are you alive or ... Am I dead ? I really don 't know . If I 'm dead I don 't remember dying . I certainly feel good enough to be alive . So you 're not a ghost ? No my child , I 've been trying to reach you . But how ? Reach us from where . Wherever it is that I 'm living now . I spent a lot of time at the botanical gardens ... thinking about the adventures we had , the camaraderie the thrill of the struggle of it all . And oh how I long to do it all again . You will , wherever you are we will find you . No second chances Marguerite once said . I hope she 's wrong about that . I miss you Veronica . I miss you all . Professor ? Professor wait ! You can always start over again . We 'll find you ! Summerlee ? Are you out there ? What are you doing out here all alone ? Oh , I 'm not alone , I 'm surrounded by memories . That won 't let you sleep ? Yeah , something like that . Well , staying awake isn 't any better . What is better Lord Roxton ? Giving in to simple desires here and now ? Giving up on my hopes and dreams of the future ? You don 't have to give up on anything . But what if my hopes and dreams don 't include you ? How does that work for the here and now ? For the here and now it works very well . And as for the future well , it 's always up for grabs . So I 'll take my chances . Will you ? We both agree you cannot forget the past . Now you 're stalling . There are too many demons . Do you remember the first moment we met , do you ? Hmm mmm . Didn 't you just know it was right somehow ? Didn 't you feel it ? Yes . Don 't you feel it now ? What was it ? A scorpion . No , no , no , Marguerite . Good lord , Roxton . - She 's been stung by a scorpion . - A scorpion ? What kind ? I don 't know . I killed it , it 's over there . We 'd better get her back to the treehouse . Oh it 's too late for that . - What are you saying ? - It 's a tree scorpion ... armed with a relatively mild neurotoxin . Although the ... paralysis is almost immediate , it is temporary . - Are you saying she 's going to make it ? - It won 't hurt to get as much poison ... out as you can but she 'll be fine in a couple of hours . A scorpion . I wouldn 't have thought it would hurt Marguerite at all . Am I still heading in the right direction ? The river . the river , is that where you want me to go ? Why did I follow you ? What am I doing ? This way Malone . Come along . Come back . Come back . Finally a good night 's sleep . Did you have any dreams ? - Nope out like a light . - No memory of scorpions ? Scorpions ? Fortunately it wasn 't the type with a fatal sting . You 're about to answer my question . What question was that , my mind is still a little foggy ? Saved by the venom of a scorpion . No . No . No . I 'm not gonna give up Summerlee . Not now . It 's not wise to leave markers like this , Malone . I wonder how badly hurt he is ? Not enough to slow him down apparently . Do you realize where we are ? A few months ago this was a raging river , the same river ... that saved our lives when we fell off the bridge . Right in the middle of Tribune 's little turf war . Veronica and I combed this valley . We thought we lost you all . Not all , only Summerlee . Exactly . All these memories lead to the waterfall . The last place Summerlee was seen . Well if the river 's not here anymore , then ... the waterfall must have dried up as well . The waterfall . No one can survive a drop like that . Save your tears Marguerite ... they say it 's a way off the plateau . Are you serious ? No one has ever returned to confirm the legend . What ? You want me to kill myself , so I 'll be a ghost ... like you ? They do say your past life flashes ... before your very eyes in the last few moments . Summerlee 's memories could be trapped in the waterfall . And scattered across the plateau in that storm ? I find that hard to believe . All the memories are in chronological order ... all the way up to the battle on the bridge . At least we haven 't seen that just yet . I don 't want to either . There they are . Thank god it 's just a vivid memory . A bit too vivid for me . They can 't possibly be real . Let 's see what a little lead can tell us . Whoa that 's one way to bury the past . Malone can you hear me ? Summerlee ? Is that you ? I 've been trying to reach you to send you a message . Where are you ? - Malone ? - Are you all right ? What is he doing ? - Summerlee ? - Malone ? Get away from the edge ! Malone NO ! Roxton ! Be off with you . Go while you can . He really is a ghost . Where 's he gone ? Wherever you are thank you for dropping in . Veronica ? What 's she doing here ? Veronica ? Malone , he fell off . What ? How did that happen ? He was leaning over ... way off balance . I tried to reach him . - Come on . - No ! There 's no way anyone could survive a fall like that . That 's what we said about Summerlee . Yes and we 've just seen his ghost to prove it . You saw Summerlee as well ? He saved us from a run-in with some old friends . He led me here . Just as he did Malone . Summerlee is trying to send us a message . The dreams , the memories , the ghostly apparitions , they 're all part of the same signal . Just like in Summerlee 's journal . Malone was reading it . Mental telepathy . Summerlee always believed in the possibilities , whether between two people in different parts of the world or ... from beyond the grave . So is he alive or dead somewhere ? I don 't know . What the hell is happening ? Help ! - Malone ? - He 's alive . What happened ? Well , I fell over the cliff . Then I was spinning around and around and this wind just lifted me up . Did you see the bottom ? I don 't know if it has one . Malone . I thought I 'd lost you . You are one lucky journalist . You know , most people ... regard themselves as fortunate if they 've danced ... on the edge of the abyss and walked away . You , you just had to jump over . Well I guess I 'm blessed . I still don 't understand what happened to all the water . As Roxton pointed out it all comes down to the weather . A river dries up , a waterfall disappears . The atmospheric conditions on the plateau are changing all the time . That 's why we suddenly started getting messages from Summerlee ? Exactly , changes to the mysterious ... clouds that surround us allowed his message to get through . So is he alive or dead ? I don 't know but I saw him , when I was spinning around . You did ? He was in some sort of greenhouse . Greenhouse ? Well that 's what he said in my dream . He ... spent a lot of time at the Botanical Gardens . But that was just a dream . Maybe it was part of his message . That means he 's really not dead . Could that be possible ? All one can conclude is that ... wherever he is , he 's managed to find a way of communicating with us . Do you think he can hear us now ? If you 're listening Summerlee , It 's good to have you back . *

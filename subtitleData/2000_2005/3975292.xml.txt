 I 'm up , I 'm up , I 'm up , I 'm up , I 'm up . Aeryn ! What the hell 's going on ? We 've been locked and targeted . Crichton : Peacekeepers ? Aeryn : No , them . Who are they ? Pilot : I don 't know , Crichton . Their ship is is badly damaged and their Comms channel 's not functioning . Have we sent the " don 't shoot us , we 're pathetic " transmission yet ? It 's the first thing we tried , but they still targeted us . What did we do to piss these guys off ? Nothing we 're aware of . D 'Argo : Rygel , I just boostered another cable . is the Defense Shield working ? No , it still registers only half power . Move it , D 'Argo . I don 't want to die because you 're too slow . If you can do any better get down here yourself , your lowness , and give it a try . Now , get me another cable ! We just have to hope that Zhaan can stall them . Zhaan ? Zhaan 's on their ship ? Pilot , I 've autodocked and I 'm coming toward what I think is their command . There 's no one here , though . We 're still targeted , Zhaan . Perhaps they 've automated their weapons . You must find a way to stop them from firing . I will try , Pilot . ( gasping ) I will never yield . You must destroy me . I am not here to hurt you . I am a Delvian Pa 'u , a priestess . I can take your pain , if you allow me . Why do you help ? Your ship ... attack us ? We didn 't attack you . Your smaller ship did . Captain called it ... Talyn . Talyn did this . is that why you targeted us ? Yes . You must believe me . We did not send Talyn to attack you . Why I trust ? You can scan us . We 're peaceful . We do not have any weapons . No weapons ? Nothing . Yoz ! No weapons ! Destroy their ship . What are you ... ? Lord ... our core is below pulse . Can only fire once if we ... We have no choice ! D 'Argo , I am unfamiliar with their ship , but I believe they are marshaling energy to fire . I need another cable now ! Coming through ! Rygel , now ! ( blended voices ) : Screw me , this is impossible . ( blended voices ) : What the frell 's going on ? That 's my body . I 'm Aeryn . Who are you ? I 'm Crichton . ( blended voices ) : By the Hynerian gods , I 'm not me . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Rygel ( Crichton ) : What are you doing in my body ? Aeryn ( Rygel ) : I don 't know . But that 's my , my , my body . Crichton ( Aeryn ) : I know , and this is my body . Oh , yotz ! Look at it . Look at what I am . Aeryn ( Rygel ) : You ? I look like , like ... Rygel . Who are you ? Me ? I 'm Crichton . Now , we just have to ... just think for a second and try and figure out what happened to us . This is not some sort of sick hallucination . I want my body back . Pilot ! Pilot ! Rygel , just calm down . I am not calming down . Pilot , why aren 't you answering ? Pilot ! Aeryn , right ? What do you think ? Of course it 's me , John . Okay , I know this is crazy but we need to focus . Look at me . I have no arms . Look at this . Aeryn , focus. I need your help . Now , I don 't know what happened to us . I don 't even know if this is real . I feel something real . - Shut up , Fluffy ! But I know that we were attacked , and if we 're attacked again , the Defense ... I think I 'm insane ! ... half power so we have to get it fully aligned . I 'm dreaming . Yes , that 's it . I 'm asleep and I 'm dreaming . I 'll wake up in my royal bedchamber surrounded by my concubines and everything will be fine . Rygel , listen to me . I 'm not listening to you . You 're a figment . You 're a part of my imagination . Oh , that 's great . That ... was real . It 's the three freaking Stooges . I 'm hitting myself . Whoever you are ... I want my body back . We all do , buddy . We all do . Look , that ship must have shot us with some kind of brain-switching weapon . I don 't know , somehow I got in you , Rygel . But why ? Why would they want us to switch bodies ? Why ? I don 't know . But if this is some kind of sick experiment , I 'm billing them for the therapy . Pilot . Pilot ! D 'Argo ( Pilot ) : Pilot , wake up . Help me . Pilot ( Chiana ) : Moya ? Moya , where ... ? Where are you ? She 's right here . Pilot , look at me . What ... ? What happened ? We were hit by some kind of weapon . But they haven 't shot again . I do not know why . Who are you ? It 's me. I 'm D 'Argo . D 'Argo . Something happened to us . We 've all been switched . It affected you the worst . You passed out . I thought you were dead . You 're ... D 'Argo . Then who are you ? Chiana . Everything 's coming apart . I don 't know what I 'm doing here , Pilot . We 're gonna die now , aren 't we ? Shut up , Chiana . D 'Argo ( Pilot ) : It 's like I have a million sounds in my head . That 's Moya . You 're multitasking . I can 't hear anything specific , Pilot . All I hear is noise , and I can 't control it . What the frell ! What was that ? Moya can 't hear me and I ... I think she 's starting to panic . Listen , D 'Argo . You 're going to have to control some of the multitasking . I can 't . Yes , you can . I 'll ... I 'll talk you through . I can 't move my legs . Chiana , take me to D 'Argo . Moya needs my help . You lied . Your ship has Defense Screen . Why have , if not warrior vessel ? We scavenged it from an abandoned Carrier called the Zelbinion . I am telling you the truth . You ... you fired on an unarmed living creature . Then why this ? That 's not us . That 's Talyn . 30 of my crew dead , and we the only living . Talyn is a genetic mutation , designed to be a gunship . We have been searching for him . Moya is not like that ship . Time count till our weapon can fire . Three arns . By the goddess , we mean you no harm . Let me take you aboard Moya . I 'll prove to you that we have no weapons . You 'll return to your ship when it is corpse . Pilot ( Chiana ) : Thank you , Chiana . D 'Argo , close your eyes . Now , listen . Listen through all the sounds in your head . Beyond them , there 's a high pitched sound very faint . I sometimes see it as a ... a sort of color . A dark red . Yes. I think I see it . Good . Now , push all the other noises to the side . Concentrate on the red one . That 's Moya 's life-support functions . Keep that in your brain at all times . Moya 's other tasks will hang off that sound like it 's a rope . I 'll try . ( engine humming ) ( popping noise ) ( DRD squeaks ) Rygel ( Crichton ) : Are these really necessary ? Can 't you remember who we are ? Crichton ( Aeryn ) : No , I can 't , Einstein . If these guys attack again I got to know who I 'm talking to . Pilot , I think I 've isolated our internal Comms . They should be working now . Good . Hang the sound on the rope in your mind like we talked about . Now , try to isolate broadcast frequencies . Are you okay ? We must contact Zhaan . Do you think she 'll be all right ? I know she docked on the Halosian ship before it fired . I ... I don 't know what happened after that . Any idea why we switched bodies , Pilot ? No . As soon as minimum functions return ( Rygel snorting ) I 'll help D 'Argo into the memory banks to run a scan . But before I switched , I sensed damage to the Defense Screen circuitry in the Neural Cluster . Nothing serious , but we need to repair transfer conduits . Aeryn ( Rygel ) : Pilot , shouldn 't we just worry about getting our bodies back ? Who cares about fixing the Defense Screen ? It didn 't stop their first blast from doing this . When we first got hit the Defense Screen was only at 62 % . If we get it properly aligned , it will protect us . I 'm on it . You coming , Aeryn ? You really know your way around this maze ? Mm-hmm . There 's hundreds of quadrants , and I had to learn them all . This says the Defense Screen power cell should be ... right up there . You 're going to have to do all the work , Crichton . I can 't do anything with these . All right . Well , follow the circuitry on the schematics and I 'll see if I can isolate the burned-out conduits . I accept your offer . I will survey Moya . If peaceful , I will let you free . Thank you . Moya is unarmed. I will prove it to you . No , you stay . If they betray , you die . They won 't . Allow me to be suspicious . I can 't believe you do this every day . My whole body aches from concentrating so hard . I 'm only doing a tiny bit of what you do and I can hardly breathe . Pilot ( Chiana ) : You 'd ... you 'd adapt quickly , D 'Argo . What 's the matter ? I don 't feel so well . Pilot , I need you here . Don 't pass out on me . I can 't do this without you . You might ... have to . No . Wait . There 's something , uh ... it 's Zhaan . I 'm getting a transmission from Zhaan . Put her on external ... vocal . There . Zhaan : Pilot , can you hear me ? Why aren 't you answering ? ! Answer her . Go on . Uh , yes , it 's me , Zhaan . Sort of . Are ... are you all right ? Yes. I 'm unharmed , but listen . The attack on Moya was not unprovoked . We did nothing . I know , but Crais did . He attacked the Halosians with Talyn . Talyn ? Was Talyn here ? 20 arns ago . Then he disappeared . That 's why they targeted us , Pilot . They think that we came here to destroy them . Look , if we can prove that Moya has no weapons , they will not fire again . The Halosian commander is willing to come aboard unarmed , if we let him search Moya and prove that we are peaceful . Hmm ... What do you think ? We don 't have much choice . Tell her it 's ... it 's agreeable . Hmm , Zhaan , tell the nawnok he 's clear to come over , but remind him we 're in no mood for yotz . One trick , one transgression , and I kill him . Pilot , what has happened to you ? I 'm fine . Just send him over . ( choking noises ) Pilot , what 's wrong with you ? Pilot ? Crichton ! Aeryn ! Pilot 's having some sort of attack ! Get up here ! Get up here now ! Crichton ! Somebody , help ! What 's happening , Crichton ? I don 't know . is Pilot rejecting my body ? What happens to my body if Pilot rejects it ? I 'm ... I 'm much ... much better , Chiana . We must keep linking ... working to link to Moya 's memory banks ... so we can analyze ... analyze the weapon that switched us . Frell that . I can 't do it , Pilot . I tried , but I can 't do it . Well , you have to . I don 't want to stay like this you pathetic Luxan . Crichton , Rygel , whoever you are . I 'll rip your head off if you don 't shut up . Wait . I 'm getting a signal . The Halosian shuttle is approaching . We better get down there . They 're expecting me ... I mean , you , to show them around . Come on ! ( breathing irregularly ) Crichton ( Aeryn ) : Pilot , D 'Argo , can you tell me if this guy 's alone ? I 've got no frelling idea , John . All I know is , he 's docking . Oh , my . What 's the matter ? I feel , um ... nothing . I just feel , um ... What ? is my body okay , Rygel ? Yes , fine . Just I think I have to ... Now ? Yes , now . Right now , yes . You can 't go now . You have to hold it . I don 't know how to hold it , Chiana . I don 't know this body . Then go . Just go . What ? Here ? Over there , now . Go . " There , now . " Hmm . D 'Argo , is this guy here yet ? He should be there any microt . Uh , Crichton . What ? Can you show me how to do this ? Oh , my god . Unzip . Right . Pull it out . ( grunts ) Point it like a gun . and shoot . Aiming it the right way ? Yes , that 's fine . He 's here . I am Tak . We figured . D 'Argo , search him . D 'Argo . Oh , sorry . Not necessary . I am unarmed . Face the wall and spread your feathers , big guy . ( Tak groans ) Where is Crichton ? Told he show me Moya . By the Hynerian gods , that is good ! Yes , so I 'll just um , put this thing away and ... ( shrieks ) Yotz ! ( groans ) Put it away and be careful , Sparky . D 'Argo ( Pilot ) : Can 't believe it. lt 's getting easier , Pilot . How are you feeling ? If I stay calm , I 'm fine . But I still sense Chiana 's body wants me gone . I never thought I 'd be separated from Moya again . It 's as though all my senses have ... have vanished . I can 't see , or hear , or feel like I did . I 'm beginning to understand . The glimpses I get of what you experience , Pilot , they make my own life feel insignificant . That 's not true , D 'Argo . It is. I have memories of my son , of a wife , but you have seen the galaxies and the birth of stars . But I have no ... no memories of love . Of friendship . None . You have the remarkable memories , D 'Argo . ( Delvian chanting ) ( Delvian chanting ) I believe ... I believe that your Moya peaceful . So will Tak when he searches it . Perhaps . Look . Show you something . I am Captain Crais . We travel in peace and we wish you safe passage . Halos-1 , my ship 's defense mechanisms have been activated . We sense your weapons have charged . Stand down . I repeat , we travel in peace . Talyn , prime guns for retaliation . Fire now ! You fired first . Talyn just defend itself . So Crais was honorable . He 's not using Talyn for battle . He could destroy us . But chose not . Why did you fire on Talyn ? Our Code . Tak desires to evolve . He must register hostile kills . As many as possible . As you can see , no weapons anywhere . If you ask me , it 's frelling ludicrous . In my royal fleet , every ship had a hundred cannon . Crichton , stop talking . Just making conversation , Rygel . so our guests can see that we are friendly creatures . Creatures with no weapons . That way , when he 's finished searching , you can change me back , right ? Everything will be dealt with . Good , good . One microt . Aeryn , I think I 'm making some progress with this idiot , so why don 't you leave us alone and I 'll show him the ship myself ? What are you up to , Rygel ? Nothing . And my own body shouldn 't be suspicious of me , so rack off ! Pff ! Now ... Okay , I 've done all I can do here . I 've changed all the burned-out conduits . Can you run an integrity check and see if this damn Defense Screen will run to 100 % now ? I 'll try , John . Okay . ( zipper opening ) ( exhales sharply ) ( chuckles ) Oh ... ( chuckling ) Oh ... Mama ! Aeryn ( Rygel ) : Crichton ? What are you doing ? Oh ... Oh come on , man , I 'm ... They 're here . They 're right here . They 've been here for a couple of arns , and I just had to ... Aeryn ( Rygel ) : You are mentally damaged . No , I 'm a guy . A guy . Guys dream about this sort of thing . Aeryn ( Rygel ) : I 'll tell you one thing , Crichton . If I find you 've been dreaming anything else to my body , I 'll break your legs , even if they are mine . What are you guys doing here anyway ? I 've just repatched the Defense Screen and Command . I need you to have a look at it . Unless you need some more ... private time . Oh , shut up , Chiana . God knows what you 've been doing to that body . Aeryn ( Rygel ) : Look , you two can fight it out later . Rygel 's about to bring the Halosians through the quadrant below this one . I came to tell you to clear out . So clear . Okay . Rygel ( Crichton ) : Haven 't you searched enough of these cells ? Think about it. lf we had a weapon , we 'd have already fired it . Yes . I believe you have no weapons . Well , there you are . That 's good . We can be friends . Come on . Yes , let 's go . Don 't stand there like a wounded trelkez . We 'll have our feast , worthy of a Royal Dominar . No , I ... I ... I feel unwell . No , no , no , we 're well-stocked for the first time in a million cycles . We have fellip shanks , Hynerian marjools .. . I think l-l ... ( vomits ) Right . Go on , go on . Let it all out . Excuse . No , no , no , that 's all right . We do that sort of thing all the time here on Moya . I just peed in the Maintenance Bay . And , um ... now that we 're friends and you know that we have no weapons , you think you can switch me back to my own body right away ? When I get to my ship ... I 'll see what I can do . Well , hurry it up . I don 't think I can stand this gangly hunk of flesh much longer . Don 't worry . Won 't be much longer . What 's going on , D 'Argo ? Moya 's scared . Something foreign to her is attacking her internal circuitry . Any idea what ? No. I can 't see anything yet . It must have been Tak . He must have brought something on board . No way . Chiana searched him . She didn 't find anything . Well , she must have missed it . D 'Argo , you 're going to have to give us a better idea of where to look . Rygel took Tak everywhere . I don 't know where . I 've got nothing here , John . All right , we 'd better find Spanky . I 'm sure he knows something . Your people talk of switching back . What means ? I have no idea . You lie , but no care . I destroy Moya . Are weapons ready ? Yes , Lord . Good . You know this is wrong . Can do nothing . Our Code forbids me ... Frell your code ! Stop him . Yoz : I 'm fascinated by your Code . Those on Moya not your race , yet you worry . Of course . We worry about nothing , except ourselves . If that is true , Yoz , if you 're just concerned with your own evolve , I can help you . Tak failed when he fired at Moya and he failed to destroy her , right ? Yes . If a Lord fails , can you replace him ? Does your code allow this ? Yes . Then you should replace him . Me ? Why not ? Wouldn 't you evolve quicker if you did ? Yes , if I ... prove his fail ... I will be your proof . I will tell anyone you want that he failed and you had to take over from him . Just ... just let Moya go . No , Tak not fail . If he not destroy Moya now , we talk again . But then it would be too late . ( bubbling ) ( electrical crackling ) You know what we have to do , Rygel ? Get the frell out of here . is that your answer for everything , Chiana ? Just run ? That 's what you do , Rygel . Yes , normally . And I 'd do it in a microt except I want my body back . Now why would you want to do that ? This body 's much better . You think ? I know . On Moya you don 't have much competition , but ... this is as good as it gets , Sluggy . But this body is so white . And it only lasts only another 40 pathetic cycles . Mine will last for ... ( gasps ) What are you doing , Chiana ? I want someone to go with me . It gets lonely out there . Normally you have to rub my eyebrows to make me feel like this . I 'll rub you anywhere you like in the Transport Pod . Don 't you want your body back ? I 'd rather be alive in this body than dead in my own . Let 's get out of here . Oh , no ! No ! No , I can 't go with you , girl . What are you doing , Rygel ? Why do you want to stay ? Because I need my body . Not this body . Only a Royal Hynerian can reclaim my throne . And the hope of executing the cousin who betrayed me ... is the only reason I live . ( footsteps ) Little guy ! Been looking for you . Listen , D 'Argo says whatever 's attacking Moya is in the Neural Cluster . That means Tak must have done something when you were showing him through . He didn 't do anything . I showed him around the ship then he got sick and left . He got sick ? What do you mean ? He threw up . Disgusting creature . Show us . What ? Show me the pavement pizza . You want to see vomit ? Nobody wants to see vomit . Rygel ( Crichton ) : Over there . He vomited over there . Yotz ! Creeping vomit . How the ... how the biznak did it do that ? I don 't know , but I 'm pretty sure the Defense Screen power cell is up here . Chiana ( D 'Argo ) : Be careful , Crichton . He must have barfed up some kind of acid to burn out these conduits . Oh , crap , the acid 's still moving . Chiana ( D 'Argo ) : What 's going on ? Crichton ( Aeryn ) : Maybe we could leapfrog the power to this cell . Chiana , go back to the den . Re-link the cables we patched in before into that cell there . Where exactly does that lead to ? I don 't know . Ask Pilot . Do you know what you 're doing , Crichton ? No , I have no idea . I 'm making it up as I go . Move ! Right , and even if we can frag leap the Defense Screen to that cell over there , how the frell are we going to stop the vomit ? We have to try and contain it . Alkaline solution neutralizes acid , right ? So do we have anything like that on board Moya ? Zhaan . I 'll wager she has some in her apothecary . All right , find it . But move . We don 't have much time . ( groaning ) The frelling Halosian ship has targeted us again . We need to re-link the Defense Screen . To where ? I was hoping you were able to tell me that , Pilot . I had to go up two tiers in the waste lift to find another way in here . Two tiers . Have you figured out what to do ? I think so . Rygel 's going to dump that stuff in there while I re-patch the Defense Screen power supply . is this going to work ? I have no idea. I 'm going to have to shut down the Defence Screen when I switch over . But the Halosians will be able to attack us . Only for a couple of seconds . We don 't have any choice , Rygel . If we don 't do this , they 're going to attack us as soon as the Defense Screen burns out . Are you ready to start dumping that crap in there ? On your call . Okay , I hope this works . D 'Argo , shut down the Defense Screen . Shutting down now . Go . Defense Screen down . Destroy them . Stop ! They 're unarmed ! Okay , D 'Argo , I 'm on . Turn on the Defense Screen . Powering now . I 've done it . I think I 've re-patched the Defense Screen . Oh , no . I 'm Aeryn . ( gasps ) Who 's Crichton ? ( imitating buzzer ) I am . Yotz ! Look , except for me being stuck in this disgusting , smelly , ugly ... My body is Royal , not smelly . Rygel ! Except for me being in here , things are looking up . How do you figure that , Crichton ? We 've switched . So , if we can switch to here , Aeyrn , then we can switch back to our original bodies , right ? Chiana ( Pilot ) : Crichton ? Aeryn ? Somebody ? It 's Chiana ... I 'm in Pilot . Pilot 's in D 'Argo 's body , but he 's not moving . We can 't get him to wake up . Get down here , John . I think Pilot is dying . Defense Screen still work . But I not fail . I ram Moya . Don 't ! Don 't ! They 're peaceful . Please . They have not hurt you . Yoz , you cannot interfere with your Lord 's plan unless he fails , right ? Well , he has failed . Stop him . Stop him . Yes ! ( hissing ) ( growling ) ( crunching sounds ) Tak was fool . I will evolve . I can 't get through to the Halosians . Can 't do anything . Do not panic . Think of the rope ! Frellthe rope ! I can 't do this , D 'Argo . Do it , you pathetic tralk ! All right . Calm down , everybody . Just calm down . D 'Argo , before the last blast is there anything you remember ? I felt the power of the blast before I shifted out of Pilot . I think the beam was trying to destroy Moya , not make us switch bodies . Then why didn 't it destroy us ? I do not know . The Defense Screen deflected most of the energy , but some got through . Oh , oh , oh , Chiana . Was the screen at full power when their beam hit ? No , the sensors say Screen power was at , uh ... 62 % . Okay . Okay . Maybe it 's the interaction of their weapon and our screen that makes us switch bodies . Part of the beam gets through . That 's the part that affects us . But how do we get back , Crichton ? Pilot is barely breathing . All right , let 's try this . We power the screen to 62 % , get in the same position we were in the first time the beam hit . Then we moon the Halosians , and hope they 'll shoot us again . Are you sure about this , John ? Nope . Another blast could kill us . Yep . The Halosian ship is heading towards us . Are its weapons targeted ? No , but it 's moving fast . I think it wants to ram us . Moya 's attempting to initiate Starburst . Don 't let her , Chiana . If she does , we 'll never get our bodies back . Keep Moya calm and initiate evasive maneuvers . Help , Aeryn ? How ? I don 't know how to do anything . I will help you . Go , John . Get back to Command . I will wake Pilot and put him in the same position he was in during the first attack . Right . You don 't have to do this ! You don 't have to die ! Will not . As soon as on target , I escape in your Transport Pod . Such a warrior 's code , killing defenseless beings . ( chanting Delvian prayer ) Now time for ... Chiana , is the Halosian ship still heading towards us ? Yes . I 'm attempting evasive maneuvers , but Moya still wants to Starburst . Crichton ( Rygel ) : Watch out Chiana , we 're going to hit . I can 't stop it ! Hold on ! ( panting ) That was freaking close ! You did it , Chiana . I didn 't do anything . Moya turned us . Wait. I 'm-l 'm picking up a transmission from Zhaan . Can you put it on the clamshell ? I 'll try . I finally have control of the ship . is everyone on Moya all right ? Well , that depends on your definition of " all right . " l , personally , would say no ... Rygel , shut up . What 's the matter ? It would take too long to explain . Look , Zhaan , we need you to do us a favor . We need you to shoot us again . Can you do that ? What is this madness ? It 's not madness . Rygel , why do you have a picture of Crichton on your chest ? Let me speak to him . But I 'm ... Crichton . She wants me ? Yeah . Zhaan wants to hear it from you . She won 't listen to Rygel . I told you . You all say I 'm paranoid , but it 's true . No one ever frelling listens to me . Can it , furball ! Great ! Now , I 'm getting yotz from my own body . By the goddess , what is this madness that has overtaken all of you ? We 'll explain later . Just shoot us , Zhaan . Full power . And don 't worry , we 'll have the screen up . Are you sure about this , Crichton ? Shoot the damn gun , you blue assed bitch . I 'm sick of all of this . Yes , I 'm sure , Zhaan . Just shoot us , full power . Trust me . Everything will be all right . If you say so , John . Disgusting . " lf you say so , John . Trust me. lt 'll be all right . " And she believes it . Well , yotz , if I said that , you 'd all vomit . Chiana , is the Defense Screen at 62 % ? Setting it now . Are the three of you in your exact positions you were in when the first beam hit ? We 're working on it . Wake up , Pilot . Please . You 've got to be just where l was . ( grunting ) I cannot move you by myself . ( grunting ) I 'm calibrating the weapons , John . Firing in ten microts . ( grunting ) Right there , Rygel . Okay . Okay . Are you both in the same position ? Yes , John . Rygel ( Aeryn ) : Are you sure ? Maybe you were here . Maybe you were there . Rygel ... Yotz . D 'Argo , how you doing ? Tell Zhaan to hang on a microt . Pilot ! ( grunting ) What ? What happened ? I can 't contact Zhaan . She 's not responding . You have to get up , Pilot . Now ! Stand ! Stand , you son of a Hezmot ! ( grunting ) Hang on , Zhaan ! Do not fire yet ! Firing now . ( whirring ) ( exploding ) ( gasps ) ( Rygel chuckling ) Crichton : Yotz .. . I 'll just crawl back to my Royal bedchamber and ... joke , Aeryn. I 'm back . ( chuckling ) You bastard . ( laughing ) Hey ! You guys okay up there ? ( Chiana laughing ) Yes , Crichton . We 're all back . ( laughing ) lt 's me . ( laughing continues ) lt 's me ! Yes ! We did it . Mmm . ( laughing ) ( both laughing ) Oh , yes , I 'm back , too . Thanks for asking . Back to being me . Back to being ignored . How large has Talyn grown ? He 's not as big as Moya yet , Pilot , but he 's fierce . When he decided to attack he easily destroyed the Halosian ship . Can we take heart that Crais didn 't initiate the attack ? Perhaps he won 't use Talyn as a weapon . Perhaps . Perhaps he 'll surprise us all . I 'm glad you 're back , Zhaan , but I must go . I must share with Moya all the experiences I 've had when separated from her . She wants to know everything . ( chuckling ) Uh ... Zhaan , will your hand ever get better ? I 've reinitiated the internal flow of nutrients , Rygel . But there 's a danger that not all function will return , so I must heal it slowly . What ? ( chuckles ) Why are you looking at me like that ? Oh , it 's nothing . It 's just that my tenkas are sore and they 've never felt like that before . So , I was wondering ... what ... what you were doing with them . Nothing . Hey , have you been speaking to Crichton ? No ... but , um ... I , uh ... did want to say to you that I ... I really ... really enjoyed ... being inside your body . Oh , ah , um ... no . What ... What I meant ... by that ... is that I ... I know what you mean . I ... I really like your body . You like my body ? Well ... they certainly seem to be readjusting well . Uh-huh . Well , they say you have to walk a mile in someone 's shoes to understand them . Well , I certainly know what you were doing when you were in my shoes , Crichton . Give me a break . ( laughing ) lt 's okay . It 's okay , you know ? You were in my shoes . I was in your pants . Excuse me ? You ...

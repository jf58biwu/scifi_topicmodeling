 In order to discover the truth The evening news doesn 't tell you How many things aren 't broadcast Who loses Who is obtaining it , and for whose sake Being pure is a beautiful and dangerous thing The world that surrounds us won 't show itself All it does is force a different truth from yesterday 's on us At the very least , I will try to change the feeling of the reality that is right in front of me Into something certain , surely The name of the person that may be the telepath is Erimiya . I 've met him once , but even now , they 're continuing to change their whereabouts . I see . It looks like a squad is needed . Please , no kids . I will be sure to choose suitable people . That , and there 's something that they 're looking for . The Sacrament of Calvaria . I thought that you might have heard of it . Episode Ten Rewritten Memory Shin-Lu ... Shen-Lon ? What 's going on today ? Your older sister checked out of the hospital . Could it be that no one contacted you ? She checked out ? ! When ? ! She regained consciousness this morning , and she was picked up by the people from the lab soon after . It was sudden , so I wonder if you ended up missing each other ? You can have this . Oh my , is that all right ? What an expensive-looking cake ! Is it really all right for me to have this ? What 's wrong ? Shen-Lon is a good kid , but ... He 's a psychic , right ? He really is kind of unnerving . Minus three ... minus two ... minus one ... zero . Breaking into plus values . Both the EKG and brain waves are free of abnormalities . No sign of rejection either . Blood pressure , pulse , and heart rate are all normal . Chief ... What is it ? Why did you overwrite Seven Eight 's ... Shin-Lu Belvedere 's mind control instead of rewriting it ? With an overwrite , there 's the possibility that the overlaid layer might strip away , which might lead to a breakdown . That 's fine . It 's not like it looked like her brainwashing was going to come undone today . It 's just that I wanted to change the colour of the layer . But , Chief ... I 'm not certain that I can endorse repeated overwriting . Along those lines , with Double One Eight as well ... It wouldn 't be strange if he were to have a breakdown at any time . That couldn 't be helped , because it wouldn 't work on him . Surely not ... Because the first time we did it , it was too strong . Hey , Yuuki ... Would it be all right for me to pass on this job ? No . I understand . You want to say that you don 't want to help smuggle dubious items , right ? I don 't know what we 're transporting , but this kind of work really is ... Open it up . I 'm telling you to open up one of the boxes in there . Despite what you may think , I am somewhat picky in choosing our jobs . Flower bulbs ? We celebrate Christmas , even in Gald . In other words , there are a lot of people waiting for those to be delivered . In other words , for this job , we 're substitutes for Santa Claus . Just kidding ! Christmas ? So you 're just going to ignore me ? Seven Eight , Shin-Lu Belvedere , correct ? Right . I heard that she was moved here from the hospital this morning . Please wait . Let 's go together next time . The shops over there have a collection of incredibly cute clothes . That 's great ! Sorry to keep you waiting . Seven Eight ... Shin-Lu ! Shen-Lon ? You just regained consciousness this morning ? What ? What 's wrong ? No , nothing . If you 've gotten better now , then it doesn 't matter . You 're weird . Why are you laughing ? I 've been worried about you this whole time . Shin-Lu ... So you 're her twin ? Hey , are you the older brother ? Or could it be that you 're the younger one ? Who are you ? I 'm Sherry , Shin-Lu 's friend . No , maybe I 'll become her friend from now on . After all , we 're teammates ! Along with you , Shen-Lon . Teammates ? ! I haven 't heard anything like that . Oh , really ? If you don 't want to , you don 't have to join us . We don 't need weaklings , after all . What ? ! Then let 's do it , and don 't hold back . I don 't recall being able to be taken lightly by the likes of you ! I 'm going to shut that mouth of yours ! Both of our powers were absorbed ! Kyou ! I told you not to be sloppy with the uniform , didn 't I ? Sagimiya wouldn 't shut up if he spotted that . You 're Shen-Lon Belvedere , right ? I 'm Maxim Feller . Nice to meet you . Maxim Feller ? I don 't know you . You will . I don 't want to . Shin-Lu ! Forget about these guys , let 's go home ! No , Shen-Lon . Shin-Lu ? Listen to what Maxim has to say . Why ? I 've got no reason to listen to him , right ? What are you saying ? Shen-Lon ! Listen to him . Shin-Lu ? This is hilarious , you sister-obsessed bastard . So the one person that you 'll listen to is your older sister ? What did you say ? ! Stop it ! We still haven 't settled this , after all . If you want a fight , that sounds good to me . That 's fine . I 'll make you regret this . What are you , kids ? Oww ... Kyou , cut it out . Why ... He 's the kid . The same goes for you , Shen-Lon . Why ... He 's the kid . The same goes for you , Shen-Lon . Shut up . Don 't order me around like you 're something ! Oh , my . You 're not going to stop him , Shin-Lu ? And this is why I say that Sagimiya is an unpleasant bastard . He 's too soft on the kids . Never learn , do you ? You 're not going to block him ? ! Are you serious ? ! It looks like you have talent , but you haven 't trained enough . Damn it ... What is that ? ! Why , you ! Damn it ! Sherry , what 's that ? Well , you know ... Isn 't it getting too big ? That just means the person inside has a huge capacity for power . A good prospect for the future . Oh , and now things are all messed up ! Hey , Maxim ! Stop it already ! Maxim , what did you do to Shen-Lon ? Nothing much . He just won 't be able to use his powers for a while . Shen-Lon Belvedere ... Starting today , you 've been transferred to my team , together with Shin-Lu Belvedere . Mission orders have already been issued . The mission objectives are to attack the guerillas and to restrain a man named Erimiya . That , and if you spot Double One Eight ... Kai Kudou , in Gald , don 't lay a finger on him . Ignore him . The guy you supposedly killed . I 'm not easygoing like Sagimiya is . Little brother ! Little brother , it would be smart for you to not defy Maxim , because the power that he uses has a draining effect , you know ? Drain ? So he can take his opponent 's powers away ? He 's ... Wait a second , Maxim ! Where are you going ? We 're not going to move out together ? If something comes up , I 'll call you . What 's with that ? That 's incredibly selfish ! Sherry ! You need to at least wear your uniform properly too ! What ? I AM wearing it properly ! How rude ! He means that you should wear the uniform they gave you , right ? I don 't want to ! If I wear something like that , then the lines of my beautiful legs will be all for nothing ! You 're a boy ? That 's a secret . Shin-Lu , no , that really hurts ! It looks like you were having some fun . I 'm going to do this my way . I 'll leave it to you . I 'm sure that it 'll go well , since it 's you . Shen-Lon ... Hey , Shen-Lon ? I 'm awake . I 'm not an invalid . I can 't stay in bed forever . Oh , you 're up there ? I thought that you still might not be able to get up yet . I made some cocoa . Do you want it ? What do you want ? I 'm going to go to Tsubaki 's place . I didn 't know about Ruri , so I thought that I would ask about her . Tsubaki was on my team . Even if you ask her , there 's no way Tsubaki would know . That 's not what I mean . They were close , right ? So ... Ruri was on HIS team , right ? ! After all , it 's obvious that it 's Kai 's fault that she died ! Shen-Lon , don 't say that ! I ... It 's not like I 'm not mad , you know . Mad ? At what ? That day ... The target area being partially destroyed ... That was your work , wasn 't it ? What did he mean , " Kai was supposed to have been killed " ? Just as you heard . It 's all right . He 's alive , isn 't he ? He 's pretty tough too . Shen-Lon ! Don 't just do what you want any more . Go to Tsubaki 's place . It 's all right now . You made a promise , right ? You 're right . I 'll do that . I 'll leave the cocoa here , okay ? Thank you . You 're welcome ! Shin-Lu ... Yes , Shen-Lon ? That playing with your hair ... I 'm sorry ! It looks like it 's come back . And I thought that I had been cured of it completely too . Shen-Lon , you 've always hated that habit , haven 't you ? I 'm sorry , I 'll be careful ! Bye ! Come here ... Come here ! Come here ! Damn it ! I ... I 've never seen Shin-Lu with that habit ! And thus , everyone was really happy ! Man , it feels great to do good things ! I 'm glad to hear that , Yuuki . Right , Kai ? We even got souvenirs . Oh , that 's right . This is for you , Asuka . For me ? Thank you , Kai ! You got one more souvenir , right ? I wonder what 's inside ? You got one more souvenir , right ? It 's a flower bulb ! I wonder what kind of flower will bloom ? I 've got it right here . I wonder what kind of flower will bloom ? I 'm good at raising these kinds of things ! Don 't tell me that 's for me . I 'm good at raising these kinds of things ! There 's no way that would be the case . Oh , right . When this blooms ... I 'm going to take it to Hikaru . The two of us had already started to get wet from the rapidly pouring rain We snuck out in a hurry , throwing away everything We wrapped our fingers together so that no one else could see it That 's our secret sign So take me away from here , take me right away Tonight midnight So don 't stop anymore , touch me right away Tonight , it 's true love The night that can 't return is going to begin Heya , it 's Shin-Lu ! How have you been ? Kai is working in Gald as a handyman . They say that his next job is as an escort for a weird rich boy . It must be tough for him ... What ? He 's living with a girl named Asuka ? They 're lovey-dovey ? Curry bread ? ! I won 't forgive them ! Next time , E 's Otherwise , episode eleven : " Sweet Melancholy " And on top of that , I 'm not in the episode ! Sweet Melancholy And on top of that , I 'm not in the episode ! Sweet Melancholy

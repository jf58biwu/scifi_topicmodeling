 So we drag all that way to trade ... and all we end up with is a couple of bags of salt ? It 's worth its wait in gold Malone ... unless you know a better way to preserve our food ? And actually I thought we did pretty well . You didn 't lose the shirt off your back . Pity , I wonder what it would take for that ? More than you can afford . It was nice of the chief to throw this into the bargain . You offered him our shirts didn 't you , our shirts for that trinket ? Ivory Malone and the workmanship is exquisite . I can 't say the same about your shirts . Ah large birds how fascinating . It 's not the birds , it 's what they 're waiting for . Which is ? Something to die . I guess they want to do this the hard way . Okay bucko . Nice work . I don 't think it 's us they 're afraid of Malone . Then what could have made them ... - Oh . - That 's our queue . He 's still alive . That 's surprising considering how much blood he 's lost . It 's not his . - But he 's soaked in it . - So is the ground . It 's been put there to draw predators . This guys like a dinner bell . Let 's get him out of here before we 're included on the menu . Eaten alive ; who would leave a man to die this way ? At the dawn of the century A band of adventurers set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World If we don 't get some water into this guy soon he 's not going to make it . Neither will we if that T-rex catches up with us . You 're all heart . Hey , maybe if you helped ... we could move a little quicker . If you want me to leave the salt behind fine . Your pants will buy another bag . Enough both of you . We 'll need to get his shirt off ... the smell of blood will bring ever raptor for miles . What about the ones that staked him out ? Oh please I can only worry about one thing at a time . Try to get some water into him . What are you doing ? Making sure we 're not being followed by any of his friends . How the hell did he get there ? A little soap and water and a shave the guy would look half civilized . Soap water and a shave and so would you and Roxton ... on the surface at least . What 's that ? Scars from manacles . I 'd say our man here was kept prisoner for a good while . Where I come from we call that picking pockets . Just trying to put a name to the face . Anybody following us ? Not that I could tell but there are ape-men all over the place . - We should get moving . - Wait ! It looks like a map . My God . The treehouse . It seems our mystery man was looking for us . That 's beautiful my dear you 've captured every detail the shading the veins in the leaves . Audubon himself couldn 't have done better . Just putting down what I see . You 're too modest . How did you come by a skill like that ? My father ... when we were exploring he drew everything he saw . Copying him was a good way to get his attention . I thought you said he was a botanist ? Art was his first love . But his parents thought that science was more respectable that painting . It 's an old story . What the devil is that ? An alarm , a warning . A warning of what ? Death . - Any idea what that means ? - No ! but I 've got a feeling it 's not good . This guy is not getting any lighter . We 'll rest here . Three minutes no more . He 's coming to . Easy old boy we 're not going to hurt you . We 're trying to help . Can you understand ? Yes . You were in a pretty rough spot when we found you . Mind telling us why ? We were on an expedition ... captured ... raiding party ... The Horta . Horta , never heard of them ? You don 't want to . They kept us in their village ... as slaves for years , until I escaped . - It seems they caught up with you . - The penalty for escape ... is death . I owe you my life . Don 't speak too soon ; sounds like they 've noticed your absence . Yes I vote we continue this discussion later . About this map ? I drew that myself years ago . It 's a map to my home . You said this is your home ? The treehouse I built it . Veronica is still alive ... after all these years I 'd given up hope . I 'm really here home . It seems like a lifetime ago but ... everything is just as I left it . Well not exactly everything . Glad your back Malone you heard the drums ? There 's something really bizarre going on . Tell me about it . Easy now . Who 's this ? Veronica ? Veronica . - Do I know you ? - Don 't you recognize him ? I knew you 'd be older but I never imagined you 'd be so beautiful . Ned ? It 's me sweetie ; it 's me . I promised I come back for you . Daddy ? Daddy ? Daddy ? Finding each other after eleven years . Sometimes life can deal you a good hand for a change . I wish it would deal us a way off this plateau . Tired of my company already . A man as fascinating as you , never . Exactly where do you think you 're going ? Just making a quick circuit of the trail to be sure we weren 't being followed . Whoever wanted Tom Layton dead is still out there . You 're always so reassuring Roxton how do you sleep at night ? Oh like a baby ... you should watch me sometime . You don 't know how many times I 've prayed for this . No more than I. I 'm here and I swear I will never leave you again . Mom , where is she daddy ? Daddy ? It was Sunday , we were scouting that little river to the west . One of the first times we ever left you alone . You said you 'd be back before dark . A raiding party jumped us ... dragged us across the plateau ; to use us as slaves . Life there was hell . It 's only the thought of getting back to you that kept us going . Please I have to know . Your mother ... she tried ; she tried so very hard . But the work ... and the sickness , there was nothing I ... I couldn 't ... I lost her . - No , no daddy . - Listen to me . When Abby died I wanted to die too . You are the only thing that kept me alive Veronica . You are my miracle . Nice try . Son of a ... All right you 've got my attention . - What the hell do you want ? - Justice . He said he 'd be back soon . He 's been gone over two hours . Well he 'll be flattered to hear you 're so concerned . I 'll deny every word . No sign of him . No blood , no gunfire , nothing . It 's like the earth just swallowed him up . No , the earth or a dinosaur . I would have seen signs of an attack ... and Roxton wouldn 't go quietly . There was just nothing . Nothing you saw . Where 's Veronica ? She 's not here she 's out with her father . Now ? What the hell were they thinking ? They wanted to spend some time together alone . It 's not safe . - Veronica knows what she 's doing . - So did Roxton . You sure it 's tight enough ? I think some blood is still reaching my hands . I am Kartas . I am Roxton . I think I recognize the rope technique . I seek the one who calls himself Tom Layton . The man that you staked out like a piece of meat . That is the sentence . - For runaway slaves ? - For murder . What the hell are you talking about ? Months ago this man was found wandering ... lost in the jungle . Weak , dying ... one of my tribe took him in , nursed him back to health . Oh really . I suppose he forgot to pay his bill . He murdered the one who saved him ... for a few pieces of gold , some food ... and a hunting knife . There must be some mistake . There is no mistake . You think we take life easily ? He was tried by my people and convicted ... it was his execution ... you interfered with . He was about to be eaten alive . There are worst things . If you 're going to kill me get on with it . If I wanted you dead you would be dead . Hey ! Thank you . I found almost everything you wanted . Hypericum Perforatum ... Papaver Somniferum and Triformis Muscaria . You 've remembered every name ; you haven 't forgotten a thing . I 've read every one of your books , a hundred times . You must have been so lonely ? Not anymore , you 're like a dream daddy . It 's hard to live up to a dream ; I hope I 'm not a disappointment ? How could you be ? The truth is ... after all these years away from my work I 've become a bit rusty . I don 't even remember what this one is called . The blue orchid . I don 't suppose you recall ... Where we found it ? It 's was my tenth birthday I 'm not likely to forget it . You remember don 't you ? So much has happened ; sometimes the memories run together . I am not the man I used to be . No you 're better . You wait here I 'll go find all the blue orchids you want . - Nothing . - Damn the man . I knew he shouldn 't have gone off alone . and neither should Veronica . No she 's not alone . She 's with her father . That 's hardly reassuring . Someone wanted to kill him in a very unpleasant way . We did say twenty minutes , didn 't we ? - So ? - So where 's Malone ? Don 't move . I 'll put a hole in you big enough to drive a street car through . - Malone ? - It is this way . I could have sworn that shot came from around here . Then why aren 't there any tracks ? What 's was that ? It was just a bird . Don 't worry we 'll find them . I wish I had your confidence . What ? A spent cartridge ; Malone 's pistol my guess . Still doesn 't tell us where they went . No , but it means he was here ... and he didn 't go willingly . Do not complain . I don 't enjoy this either . Be silent . No ... no I am innocent . It wasn 't me I swear . How easily you lie . - Why did you kill him ? - Why not ? No , please . Daddy , are you hurt ? He 's one of the slavers that held me . He 's still alive . - Not for long . - No ! Leave him ... there may be more of them out there . - We have to get back and warn the others . - Did you find the blue orchid ? - Yes . - Where is it ? There . My work and you you 're all I have . I won 't let either of you be taken away . I 'm sorry daddy , if it means that much to you . If I ever get out of here I 'll be a couple of feet taller . Oh that was close , very close . Please tell me you 're a vegetarian . Whoa , good boy ... down . Over here . Now we 'll try it without the ropes . All right you bastard meet the Marquis of Queensbury . Now either we get civilized or I 'm going to break it . If you wanted me dead I 'd be dead . I guess you 've never heard of Queensbury . Where the hell have you been all day while I was getting dragged around in the jungle ? - Oh just hangin ' around . - This is no time for jokes . - Tell me about it . - Who was that guy with the tattoos ? The one who staked out Tom . Well you should have finished him . It 's not like I wasn 't trying Malone . - I guess we 're lucky to be alive . - Very lucky . What do you mean by that ? I think it 's about time we had a little talk with Veronica 's father . If Veronica hadn 't come when she did , I 'd be dead . Still no sign of Roxton or Malone . Challenger and Marguerite are going to need my help to find them . - That 's too dangerous . - I have to . Come back to me . I will . Isn 't that a Triformis Muscaria ? As a matter of fact it is . Contains a neural poison ; it could cause paralysis . True but when you combine it with other plants ... including the blue orchid ... it simply becomes a pain killer . I had no idea . Veronica draws like another Audubon you must be very proud of her . Always , wish I had the talent . She got that from her mother . Abigail ? Veronica said that you taught her yourself . Of course , we both did . Did you know that the latent period of that ... Muscaria will last another three weeks . I 'd actually accounted for that . The Muscaria has no latent period . You 're not a botanist ... and you 're not Tom Layton ! Don 't worry old man I won 't kill you . I need your help . - I 'll be damned if I 'll help you . - You 'll be damned old man ... but you will help me . Roxton you are crazy ... Veronica 's father wouldn 't murder anyone . - Yes does seem unlikely . - Unlikely ? I can 't believe you 're taking his side . Look Kartas is the sort of man that . What ? It 's his name Malone . Didn 't realize you were on a first name basis . Look if you hadn 't escaped ... we would have been a two course lunch for that guy . I doubt it . I 've never seen a cannibal without sharpened teeth . Well then we would have been rotting away in some slave camp like Tom . I don 't know ... there was something about Kartas that I believed . He had conviction ... purpose . - Purpose ? - Yeah . You know what had purpose ? That dinosaur , that was gonna ... eat you , had purpose . But Kartas killed it ... when he could have just left us to die , why ? That son of a bitch cold cocked me with a Billy Club . We stole his prisoner . We rescued him . Tom is Veronica 's father and that 's enough for me . There 's no choice ... if we 're going to find Malone and Roxton we need to widen our search area . That means splitting up into two groups . Exactly . Veronica can stay with her father ... and Summerlee , Summerlee ? Tom needs my help . That puts you with me . Wonderful . I 'll just close my eyes and try to think of England . For Veronica . You know he 's actually getting better at this . We 'll start at the river . You already checked the river and didn 't find a trace . Maybe we should take another look . Whatever you do you should stay together . The man who came after me is very dangerous . And a persistent little devil too isn 't he ? He 's come to take me back to the slave camp . He won 't quit until he 's been killed ... I 'm sure you agree Challenger . Are you okay ? I must have picked up a little fever . But yes he probably won 't quit until he 's been killed . That 's odd ... he 's gone to a lot of trouble to take back a runaway slave . Well clear the decks the Paris fashion show has hit town . You look beautiful . It was my mother 's . What do you think daddy ? Do I look like her ? You look so much like her . It 's as if your mother were here with us . Summerlee have you noticed anything about Tom ? Such as ? Oh I don 't know , something about his story doesn 't quite hold up . Indeed , in what way ? Oh come on , a savage drags halfway across the plateau for a runaway slave ? And you didn 't see that look he just gave Veronica . I don 't know what you mean . Oh neither do I. I can 't help feeling there 's something wrong with the guy . As far as I 'm concerned Tom is fine . I wish I could say the same about you . Challenger Summerlee ? Veronica ? No one here Malone they 're gone ... and so are the guns . Guess that lets out the notion of a picnic . Roxton quick ! - Marguerite . - She 's alive . Someone 's hit her pretty hard . Well , I guess that rules out your theory of the noble savage . I 'd say Kartas beat us here . Seems you 're right . Why are there no signs of a struggle ? No blood , no shells . Maybe they escaped to the jungle . He 's only one man . - Who trapped the two of us . - I 'm going after him . I 'm with ya . One of us has to stay here with Marguerite . You 're going to go after him alone and unarmed . There 's nothing in there except dried herbs and rat droppings . Son of a gun . You could say that . Always keep an ace up your sleeve Malone . Roxton , if it comes down to you or him . I 'll make sure it 's him . You were bait , a trap . And you walked right into it . I wish you no harm . I 'm after the evil one . You don 't mean me ? Good girl . Sooner or later justice is always served . You think it was just I was born a slave in the stinking mines . That the only sunlight I ever saw was through a metal grate ? That does not excuse murder . Like hell , I needed food and trade goods for my journey here . So you murdered a man who saved your life ? I 'd kill a thousand to get here . When Layton and his wife were chained beside me they told me about this place their life ; their daughter . It was like a dream . Then they told me they had found a drug that could turn anyone to their will . So I stole their map ... and disappeared and I found the drug ... that will make a slave named Largo ... a king . Never happen . Kings need wisdom and compassion ... seems like yours are in short supply . Challenger , Summerlee best back off . Oh . what the hell 's going on ? They 're drugged Roxton . They have no will of their own ... until it wears off and you will be long dead by then . Drop the gun . Who would you rather be killed by Roxton ... a friend or an enemy ? Run ! All right guys . Find him and when you do kill him . Oh Malone . It 's okay Kartas is gone . Kartas ? Who the hell is Kartas ? The man who attacked you . It was Summerlee who hit me . Summerlee ? Maybe you better lay down . Maybe I need to say it slower . Summerlee whacked me with a skillet . - Why would he do that ? - I don 't know . It 's got something to do with Tom Layton . Veronica 's father ? If he 's her father I 'll wash Roxton 's socks for a month . You should have seen the way he looked at her . On second thoughts maybe you shouldn 't . There 's definitely something wrong with this guy . Kartas the one that was following Tom . What about him ? He swore that Tom was a murderer . We 've got to go after them . Where 's my gun ? Forget it all the guns are gone . - What about your pistol ? - History . We 're unarmed ? I got this from the kitchen . Perfect we 'll mince them to death . Logic Challenger , you 're a sucker for it . I have to kill you . Didn 't you hear ; he drugged you . - You have to die . - I got that part . You have no choice . Friends can 't reason with them can 't shoot them . On the contrary Roxton it 's really no problem . How disappointing ; time to reload . Where are you going ? The gunshots came from this way . Someone 's coming . - Empty . - I know . Great . - Could I have the gun back please ? - Why ? So I can kill you . You 're serious ? What in Gods name has gotten into you ? It 's the plants you see ; Tom has discovered this marvelous neuro-toxin . A what ? A drug that for a few hours makes anyone obey . How handy . I need my gun . What you need is a lobotomy . Take off his belt and tie him up . I 'll get a head start and try to find Roxton . Veronica it 's me , Roxton . Roxton dies . Damn it , Roxton doesn 't die ; put the knife down now . I can 't ! What do I have to do to make you stop ? - Kill me . - Please , I 'm your friend . And he 's my father . I don 't know who the hell he is Veronica ... but he 's not your father . Liar ! No , no . No ! Roxton ! Roxton are you all right ? I 'm fine , help Marguerite . I don 't think so . Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Veronica he 's not your father . He 's not your father . Are you sure you want to do that ? That drug was my father 's secret . It 's going to stay that way . I 'm sorry about Tom . That he wasn 't ... I think a small part of me knew . I just wanted him to be so much . Largo knew a lot about the treehouse . He knew a lot about you too . That means that your parents are still alive . But where ? There are thousands of mines ... a lifetime of ground to cover . You 'll find them . You think so ? Someday .

Joanie , ifyou had actually read the short story , which , at a whopping 1 3 pages would have kept you up all night , you would know that the children ... You suck . find a great deal of money in the mattress , but they burn it . Donnie Darko , perhaps with your recent brush with mass destruction , you can give us your opinion . Well , they say it right when they flood the house , and they tear it to shreds that , like , uh , destruction is a form of creation . So the fact that they burn the money is ironic . Theyjust want to see what happens when they tear the world apart . They want to change things .

Do you think the world is coming to an end ? No . That 's stupid . [ Woman On TV ] For my entire life , I was a victim of my own fear . Love . [ Woman ] I was feeding fear with food . Fear . [ Horse Whinnies ] And finally , I looked in the mirror . Not just in the mirror , I looked through the mirror . In that image ... I saw my ego reflection .

So , why did you move here ? My parents got a divorce . My mom had to get a restraining order against my stepdad . He has emotional problems . Oh , I have those too . What kind of emotional problems does your dad have ? He stabbed my mom four times in the chest . Oh . Did he go to jail ? No , he fled . They still can 't find him . But my mom and I had to change our names . And I thought " Gretchen Ross " was really cool . Yeah. I was in jail once . I mean — I accidentally burned down this house . It was abandoned , but still — I got held back in school and I can 't drive until I 'm 2 1 . You know ? But I 'm over all of that . I 'm painting and stuff . Writing. I want to be a writer .

No , no , no , not " Vanity . " l heard he was a homosexual . Okay , well , you know what ? Then she fucks them while Vanity watches . Okay ? What about Papa Smurf ? - He must get in on the action . - Yeah , what he does , he films the gang-bang . Later on , he beats off to the tape . First of all , Papa Smurfdidn 't create Smurfette . Gargamel did . She was sent in as Gargamel 's evil spy ... with the intention of destroying the Smurf village . But the overwhelming goodness ... ofthe Smurfway oflife transformed her . And as for the whole gang-bang scenario ─ [ Laughs ] lt just couldn 't happen . Smurfs are asexual . They don 't even have reproductive organs under those little white pants .

And so can you . [ Applause ] And I think that this garbage should be removed . Excuse me .

Please press " stop " now . [ Sighs ] As you can see , the lifeline is divided into two polar extremes . Fear and love . Fear is in the negative energy spectrum . And love is in the positive energy spectrum . No duh . Excuse me ? " No duh " is a product of fear . Now , on each card is a character dilemma ... which applies to the lifeline . Please ─ Take this ! Thank you . Please read each character dilemma aloud ... and place an " X " ... on the lifeline in the appropriate place . Cherita ? " Juanita has an important math test today . " She has known about the test for several weeks ... " but has not studied . " ln order to keep from failing her class , Juanita decides that she will cheat on the math test . " Good , good . Very good . Mr. Darko . " Ling Ling finds a wallet on the ground filled with money . " She takes the wallet to the address on the driver 's license ... but keeps the money inside the wallet . " [ Scoffs ] I 'm — I 'm sorry , Mrs. Farmer . I don 't get this . Just place an " X " on the lifeline in the appropriate place . No . I know what to do . Ijust ─ I don 't get this . You can 't lump things into two categories . Things aren 't that simple . The lifeline is divided that way . Well , life isn 't that simple . I mean , who cares ifLing Ling ... returns the wallet and keeps the money ? It has nothing to do with either fear or love . Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions . Okay . But you 're not listening to me . There are other things that need to be taken into account here , like the whole spectrum of human emotion . You can 't just lump everything into these two categories ... and then just deny everything else . Ifyou don 't complete the assignment , you 'll get a zero for the day . Donald , let me preface this by saying ... that your Iowa test scores are ... intimidating . So ... let 's go over this again . What exactly did you say to Mrs. Farmer ? I 'll tellyou what he said ! He asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus ! [ Snickers , Coughs ] [ Woman ] These are modern times . My political attitudes are forthright . [ Chuckles ] And ifthere 's a vice-presidential candidate ... worthy ofmy vote , it has to be Dan Quayle . Yeah . [ Mrs. Farmer ] Nobody cares about responsibility , morality , family values . Mm-hmm . [ Sighs ] Kitty ─ - Excuse us , please . - Hmph . They 've suspended him from after-school activities ... for the next six months . [ Sighs ] Ever since this jet engine fiasco , I honestly don 't know what 's gotten into him . Rose , I 'll tell you this because our daughters ... have been on the dance team together for two years ... and I respect you as a woman . After witnessing your son 's behavior this afternoon , I have significant doubts about your — Our paths through life must be righteous . I urge you to go home and look in the mirror ... and pray that your son doesn 't succumb to the path of fear . [ Elizabeth ] Wait . Do you remember ... that weird gym teacher Mrs. Farmer ? Yeah . Okay , well , my brother ... told her to shove a book up her ass today . And then my parents just bought him all this new shit . Yeah , I know . I wish a jet engine would fall in my room . [ Frank ] I can showyou the way . [ Bells Tolling ] Yeah . Dr. Monnitoff ? Donnie . Um , I know this is gonna sound kind ofweird , but , uh , do you know anything about , um , time travel ? [ Dr. Monnitoff ] Ah , a wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge , which is , theoretically , a wormhole in space ... controlled by man . So , according to Hawking , a wormhole may be able to provide a shortcut ... forjumping between two distant regions of space-time . So in order to travel back in time , you have to have ... a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light ? Theoretically . And be able to find one of these wormholes ? The basic principles of time travel are there . You 've got your vessel and your portal ... and your vessel could be just about anything ... most likely a spacecraft . Like a Delorean ? Metal craft of any kind . You know , I love that movie , the way they shot it . It 's so , um , like , futuristic , you know ? Listen , um , don 't tell anybody that I gave you this . The woman who wrote this used to teach here . She was a nun many years before that , but , uh , then overnight , she just ─ She became this entirely different person . She up and left the Church . She wrote this book . She started teaching science , right here at Middlesex . The Philosophy oftime Travel . Roberta Sparrow ? That 's right . [ Chuckles ] Come on . Roberta Sparrow ? Roberta Sparrow . " Grandma Death . " It 's called The Philosophy oftime Travel . What does philosophy have to do with time travel ? Let me see . Guess who wrote it . Who ? Roberta Sparrow ? Huh . She wrote a book . " Grandma Death " wrote a book . That 's a terrible nickname . We almost hit her with the car the other day . She lives up there in that piece ofcrap house . And you know she 's loaded . She ' ─ Yeah , you 're right . She used to be known for her gem collection . Kids ... used to go up there all the time and try to steal stufffrom her . She became a total recluse . Huh. I didn 't even know she was alive ... till we damn near knocked her down the other day . [ Donnie ] She wasjust standing there ... in the middle ofthe road , frozen . So I got out ofthe car ... and I walked over to see ifshe was okay . And she leaned over and whispered in my ear . - What did she say ? - l think Frank wants me to go talk to her , because the last time I saw him ... he asked me if I knew about time travel . She wrote a book about it , so that can 't be a coincidence , right ? Donnie , what did Roberta Sparrow say to you ? She said that every living creature on Earth dies alone . How did that make you feel ? It reminded me of my dog Callie . She died when I was eight , and she crawled underneath the ─ the porch . To die ? To be alone . Do you feel alone right now ? Oh , I don 't know . I mean , I 'd like to believe I 'm not , but I just ─ I 've just never seen any proof , so I — I just don 't debate it anymore , you know ? It 's like I could spend my whole life ... debating it over and over again , weighing the pros and cons . And in the end , I still wouldn 't have any proof . So I just ─ I just don 't debate it anymore . [ Laughs ] lt 's absurd . The search for God is absurd ? - lt is if everyone dies alone . - Does that scare you ?

Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called ... a daylight hallucination . [ Thumping ] This is a common occurrence ... among paranoid schizophrenics . What can we do ? I would like to , um , do more hypnotherapy ... and increase his medication . [ Thumping ] [ Rose ] Whatever will help him , really , because that 's why we 're here .

Son , it breaks my heart to say this , but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man . I believe you are searching for the answers in all the wrong places . You 're right , actually . I am pretty ─ I 'm pretty troubled ... and I 'm pretty confused , but I — And I 'm afraid . Really , really afraid . Really afraid . But I-I thinkyou 're the fucking Antichrist . [ Gasping , Murmuring ] [ Man ] Who do you thinkyou are ? [ Cheering , Whistling ] It 's amazing , you know ? The man thinks he 's telling the truth , and everything he says is just a fucking lie . Everything he says ! Everyone thinks he 's so rad . He 's such a fucking chud . Everything he doe ─ Are you okay ? Yeah . Sit down . Calm down . You ever hear of Grandma Death ? Who ? The Philosophy oftime Travel . What is this ? She wrote it . I 'm — I 've been seeing stuff . Like , a lot ofreally messed up stuff . And there are chapters in that book that describe the stuff I 've been seeing , and it can 't just be a coincidence . [ Dr. Monnitoff ] Well , each vessel travels along a vector ... through space-time along its center ofgravity . Like a spear . I beg your pardon ? Like a spear that comes out ofyour chest . Um , sure . Yeah . And in order for the vessel to travel through time , it 's got to find a portal , or in this case a wormhole ─ Well , could these portals , um — Could these portals just appear , uh , anywhere , anytime ? I think that 's highly unlikely . No , I think what you 're talking about is , um , an act of God . If God controls time , then all time is pre-decided . I 'm not following you . Every living thing follows along a set path . And ifyou could see your path or channel , then you could see into the future , right ? Like , uh — lt 's a form of time travel . Well , you 're-you 're contradicting yourself , Donnie . If we were able to see our destinies manifest themselves visually , then we would be given a choice to betray our chosen destinies . And the mere fact that this choice exists ... would make all preformed destiny , uh , come to an end . Not ifyou travel within God 's channel . Um , I 'm not going to be able to continue this conversation . Why ? I could lose myjob . Okay . [ Chuckles ] [ Frank 's Voice ] Nowyou know where he lives .

What didyou find ? Nothing . So we call them l.M.G. ' s . Infant memory generators . Yeah , so the idea is that you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep . [ Gretchen ] But inside the glasses are these slide photographs , and each photograph is ofsomething peaceful or beautiful . Whatever the parents want to put inside . And what effect do you think that this would have on an infant ? Well , the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . Anyone who says they do is lying . So we think this will help develop memory earlier in life . Yeah . Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness ? That maybe darkness is part of their natural development ? [ Gretchen ] No . Mm-mmm . - [ Snapping Fingers ] - Yeah . What ifthe parents , like , put in pictures ofSatan ? Or , like , dead people ? Crap like that . is that what you 'd show your kids ?

 Previously on Farscape . Aeryn is with child . Still obsessed , I see . Did she say anything to you before she left ? I finally figured out wormholes . You did it . All that wormhole nonsense . Yeah . I can get you home . There she is . Pilot . Moya looks beautiful . Aeryn . You 've come back . I 've got Heat Delirium . Who saved your life ? Who ? I did . He wants asylum . No ! You 're buried . You 're dead . I gave my word that he would not be harmed . Put your weapons down . We ask you to choose one spokesperson . You mean , just pick a captain ? Yes . So , you could tell me ... you were pregnant . And now on Farscape . We are sitting at a dead stop in the middle of nothing because Crichton thinks he can smell a wormhole about to open ? Does anyone else find this vaguely preposterous ? We promised him two arns . We 'll give him two arns . Captain . You had your turn and now it 's mine . Until we elect a permanent captain , I demand the same respect and obedience ... Aah ! Why did you construct another of those hideous instruments ? My bowels make better music . Hey . How 's it coming ? Almost finished . I 'm close to balancing harmonics across the difficult setra chords . Not you , you ripnitz . Has Crichton found any wormholes ? Ba boom . Wormhole in ... Does that nixer really annoy you ? - Ocho ... Siete ... No . Seis ... Cinco ... Quatro ... Tres ... Dos ... Uno . Tear out page 42 . We 're sorry , Commander . Oh , you know , Pilot . You and Moya hate wormholes , but thanks for sayin ' so . Do you know what you did wrong ? You mean other than getting up this morning ? Have at it , Cap . Knock yourself out . Uh ... Your orders , Captain Rygel ? Have you chosen a flight vector ? Give me another microt with this miserably ... Would you excuse us ? Can I speak to you ? Quite a few things I 'd like to say . There 's a lot of things I 'd like to hear . I 'd offer to buy you a drink , but ... My quarters . Frell . Crichton ... - I don 't believe it . - It 's a frelling wormhole . Look at that . Well done , John . The frelnik actually predicted a wormhole . You did it . Hey , now there 's three of us who like you . Commander , this wormhole is a great deal larger and closer than your assurances . Back it on up , Pilot . Anything you want . Excuse me , but there is a chain of command in place . Whatever , Sparky . Rock on . All right , Pilot , I think that under the circumstances ... that yes , I agree , we should ... You all right ? - Yeah . What hit us ? - Don 't know . Can you move ? - My arm ! What happened to the stars ? My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Budong ! It 's gotta be a budong ! Unlikely . We 're not moving . - There 's nothing . - Everything 's blown . Pilot , be there . Okay , I 've secured a patch but it won 't last long . Sikozu ! When I 'm done here . There are no stars . It 's the ... the Flax . The wormhole got us . We 're gonna die . Hey , Captain Chaos ... Try comms now . Pilote . Como estas , hombre ? Commander , are you all right ? A little south of that . What the hell is goin ' on ? - Undetermined . Moya 's convulsing unlike anything I have experienced before . And therein lies our problem . It 's not his fault , Sputnik . Yes , it 's probably yours ! He wasn 't the captain . Pilot , what did we hit ? Nothing . We weren 't moving at the time were we ? Correct . Something hit us . Well , what you frell-wit ? ! There aren 't any stars . I have no external readings . Not a single sense neuron on Moya 's skin is transmitting . That cannot be right . It is , you disagreeable ... How can that be right , Pilot ? Something is attacking Moya across all exposed surfaces . Her skin is burning everywhere at once . Well , what do we do ? Under the circumstances a hull breach will go undetected . Perimeter hull search . Interior . - With Chiana ? Yeah . - With ya . Has anyone heard from Scorpius ? Scorpius , are you all right ? Physically , yes . However , I would appreciate being let out of this cell ... Absolutely not ! Grandmama ? Yo , School Lunch Lady , you there ? Great , we got an MIA . Don 't have time to look right now . D , how about a little space walk ? Ver ... Verdure ? Verdure . Herbage ... Flora ... Herbage . Flora . Plant ! Hmm , what kind of plant lives in space ? What kind of plant can grab a Leviathan ? I 've never seen anything like this before , have you ? D , it wasn 't that long ago I hadn 't heard of you . Looks like Glinda was right . We got some kinda weird plant , man . Can you see any stars through its vegetation ? Nah . It 's pretty damn deep . We 're going to take some samples . I suspect inopportune timing , but I require some assistance . You are not getting out of that cell , Scorpius . No doubt . However , I believe the fire will not honor that edict . I 'm on my way , Scorpius . Hey . What ... are you doing ? Fire on a ship is our number one priority , Chiana . I just happened to get here first . He 's a prisoner . Door stays closed . Does he look like he 's trying to escape ? Out . Out ! Okay . I know you think you 're pretty smart . But we know Scorpius better than you do . He probably set that fire . Look down the passageway . If I can start fires , I am most proficient at it . Frell ! There 's fires everywhere . It 's oozing some kind of gunk dissolving the metal . Pilot says Moya 's fluids are rushing in to protect internal organs . It 's causing ruptures everywhere . This stuff is killing my eyes . How come it 's not killing your eyes ? It 's like an onion . We 'll live . We 've got to get it off Moya 's skin . You know what ? - What ? We 'll blast it off with Lo 'La . Hold it steady . I am trying , but it 's not responding . I need more of your DNA . You know , I hate this ship . It 's messy . Whoa . How bad is the situation ? Do we tell ' em the truth ? Uh-uh . Truthfully , Pilot , it 's nothing we can 't handle . We 'll get back to you later on the details . And we are off the air . Every measure I take is soon overcome by Moya 's pain . How did you miss the plant ? I didn 't . We assumed it was debris , and quite far away . When the wormhole distracted us , it snuck up . Why should a plant be floating so far out here ? I don 't know . We 'll worry about that later . Just don 't give up . Aeryn ? If too much of Moya 's skin becomes irreparably damaged , she will not recover . We 'll fix it . One last chance . You wanna wait for ... What ? So Noranti can tell us how to make a great salad ? No . See plant . Kill plant . That 's gotta be on the Luxan coat of arms . I don 't suppose you have a better idea ? Nope . Well , then hold it steady . Leak ? Scalon vapor return duct . Can linger in your bloodstream . Never stopped you before . Yeah , well this time I 'm pregnant . Before or ... or after you left Moya ? Before . Does Crichton know ? Mm . Nice . What he doesn 't know is that it may not be his . Oh , you , you mean the other Crichton . Somebody ... somebody else ? Possibly . I only found out on the Command Carrier and I haven 't had it DNA tested yet . Your life is ... is so much more interesting than mine . Can I trust you ? Yeah . I don 't want you to tell John . No way . Never . Never . That 's ... that 's your speech . Come here . Okay . If I have calculated the plant depth correctly , we 'll be able to burn right through it without Moya feeling a thing . Any news from the candy kitchen ? Nothing unexpected . The plant secretes an acid that dissolves certain types of metal which it then ingests . The burning in your eyes is due to a waste gas . Must go a long time in between meals . No , not really . Think of your wormholes . Every time it opens , the sudden gravitational presence ... Draws the debris towards it . Yes . I would ... I would think . She 's too smart . Okay , I 'm initiating the firing sequence . Hmm ... What is it ? Eat ... eats ... Cry ... tears ... Cry ... grow ... I can 't understand . - tears ... You ready ? Mm . What is it ? I can 't understand . Eat ... John , I 'm going to tell you something I 've never actually put into words before . I love shooting things . Don 't shoot the plant ! You know what ? I 'm very good at it . Crichton , D 'Argo , hold you fire . Stars ... Hold you fire . Can you hear me ? I repeat hold you fire . See ? They didn 't even feel it . Do not shoot the plant . I repeat , do not shoot the plant . Well , if it was so important , she should have spoken up sooner . I tried . Back up . You say it 's gonna eat faster if it 's attacked ? It ate its way through the pot rather than be cooked . Wouldn 't you ? I didn 't boil the plant , I shot it . It 's dead . Then why do my eyes still sting ? D , your eyes bugging you ? That 's a yes . Pilot , how 's Moya ? No change , Officer Sun . Perhaps a slight worsening . She cannot localize the sensations but she still feels the burning . What 's that ? Just a couple of dead roots . Ah ! Doesn 't look dead to me . It has to be . I killed it . Moya 's pain is increasing . What is happening ? It 's in the frelling ship . The plant is in the frelling ship . Pilot , how far has it spread ? I can 't tell . Moya 's senses are overloaded . It could be anywhere . We 'll get it out , Pilot . I found two of these . Is that helping you at all ? Not much . For once in my life , I wish I had your inferior noses . Pip , how you doing in there ? I 'm ... I 'm not going up there again . Can you send ... send Rygel next time , okay ? I 'm not doing that . I want ... I want my weapons and I want my comm . They 're right here . Thank ... thank you . Here . What did you see ? What 'd I see ? Was plant . Everywhere . Up one tier , down ... down two tiers . As far as you can see . It 's okay ... It 's ... it 's my clothes . It 's my clothes . Here , come down . - It 's in my clothes . - All right , calm down . - It 's not going to hurt you . It eats through metal , not flesh . It ... it itches . All right , I 'll help you . - It itches . It 's all through the ship . It 's my fault . Oh well , we all signed off on the plan . It 's probably the first time that 's happened . If we screwed up . We all screwed up . Come on . Pilot , what the yotz is wrong with the lights ? I don 't know . Well that 's hardly good enough , is it ? Find the problem and fix it . Chiana , put it away . It 's in the bulkhead , not frelling running around . Yeah , so far . What are you doing ? Just checking to see how far it 's spread . So far it 's on every frelling tier I 've looked at . You know what ? I think it 's spawning . It 's not the only one . You pregnant ? Not me . Aeryn . Aeryn is pregnant ? No . Yeah , it 's the truth . I swear . Does John know ? Oh , yeah . But here 's one thing he doesn 't know . The nahi might not be his . But is she conceived on Talyn , and if it 's Crichton 's DNA , then it 's his , isn 't ? Yeah , but it might not be John Crichton 's at all . Well , then who 's ? Good question . Who told you this ? Rygel . You can 't tell anybody , okay ? Hey come on , he deserves to know . Please , swear you won 't tell anybody . D 'Argo ? What is the matter with you ? This Leviathan is in pain . Dying . Leviathans are good . Good things shouldn 't have to die . That 's right . That 's why we have to keep working on this plant . Oh . Oh ... itches . Can 't scratch . Bad to scratch . I might go blind . Oh , what to do ? All right . All right . Here 's what we do . We help your eye and the Leviathan by finding a way to kill the plant . How ? However we can . Maybe a poison . I ... I know lots of poisons . Yes , I 'm sure you do . Right ? Aeryn ? I 'm over here . Hey . Uh , I checked the whole lobe . There 's no , uh ... there 's no plant in Moya 's neural tissue . She 's going to be all right . It means we can save her , right ? Yeah , but we still have other lobes to check . Right . Okay . All right . Oh , Chiana . Yeah ? About that conversation that we had before . What ? What conversation ? The one about the , uh ... Oh , the ... Yeah . I was wondering if you could do me a favor . Sure . Could you forget that we had that conversation ? S - sure , but you ... you know , you had to tell somebody , so I don 't ... Yeah , um ... now I 'm ... really regretting that I did . I may not even tell him . What ? Ever ? Never ? Well , I need to know whose it is first , and ... I can 't tell him that I don 't know . So ... could you just forget that it happened ? Sure . Is that okay ? Yeah . Of course ... of course it is . Definitely . Thanks . I 'm gonna ... Oh , frell ! All right . You got me here . What do you want ? Watch . Back up . Back up . Aeryn ! This way . John , what is it ? Seems that Audrey has taste . She doesn 't like Scorpius . To the right . What 've you got ? Good news as well . I can 't find any traces of the plant in the Neural Cluster . So it likes eating metal but it doesn 't like toubray tissue . Aeryn , what the hell was that ? Are you okay ? Aeryn , talk to me . Give me a microt , Crichton . Listen , Pilot , the Neural Cluster . Pilot ? Could be his cooling rods . Could just be his personality . Let 's just hope it 's these rods . How 's the damage to Moya ? Contained to a small section of one lobe . There should not be any loss of brain function . What about the plant ? Why wasn 't there any in the Neural Cluster ? Because there is no metal in the toubray . But there is metal in the electrolyte regulators . And when they jammed , the synapses overloaded . I wish to assist however I can . There is no need for these restraints . I believe you . The others don 't . It 's working . Crichton , it 's working . Yup . There you go . We got lucky . It 's definitely the rods . Is that all we have ? It may not be enough . I 'll see how far I can dilute them down . John ? Yeah . I know Aeryn 's pregnant . Chiana told me . Chiana . Rygel told her . So the whole ship knows ? Well , I don 't think Moya does , but , uh ... Go ahead . Aeryn isn 't sure if the child is John Crichton 's . The thought had crossed my mind . Doesn 't matter . So what do you think ? I think that either way , you 're going to get hurt . So , uh ... look after yourself . Thanks . Oh . Hmm ... We 're not interested in its flavor , you ... I 'm not going to insult you . No , no , no , no . It 's more like hindrati petal tea . Ooh , I can feel the fungus dying as they mingle in my mouth . Concentrate . We know it works as an aerosol , but which element ? Or is it the compound as a whole ? That is what we have to solve . In a casserole , no . But if stewed properly , I believe that this plant may compliment a variety of meat dishes . You defy the whole theory of natural selection . Do I ? Listen to me . These people are trying to save this ship and us . Now , if their plan fails , we need to know why this works . You are here . Why didn 't you respond ? You were meant to be checking the circulation . You do it . Air flow is still functioning . John and Aeryn are clear to go . Let 's not spill any of this Scorpy juice . It 's all we got . Got it . Rygel , you 're often insufferable . But , uh it 's not your fault . I was Captain . Yes , you were , and , uh Pilot 's Pilot and Moya 's a Leviathan . No matter what orders you give , they 're not going to fly into something they can 't sense . But this plant . This fungus . Didn 't register . Still ... I was in charge . There are so many other reasons why you should hate yourself at the moment . Like sulking while others are out there , risking their lives . Now monitor the air flow . Pilot , we gonna be okay in there ? Tiering fan filters in the atmospheric scrubber allows a dampening of air flow . Yeah , it 's all very PBS . We 'll take that as an affirmative . So , you wanna talk ? I appreciate you waiting for this appropriate time and place . Yeah , I got pretty good at waiting . I can 't believe this is all we have . Sikozu and Noranti thinned it out as much as they could . All right . They 're in position . I 'll let you know when the vapor trail arrives . At the moment , all there is is this hungry plant and my frelling inability to breathe . I 'm as far away from you , Hamman side , as I can get . It doesn 't look good . Just hang tough , Pip . It may be a little while . Better cut that in half . Even the DRDs have given up . The fungus is everywhere . Hopefully that 'll change as soon as this Scorpy juice evaporates into the air stream . You know we don 't have a contingency . Eh , this 'll work . Unless that plant can mutate in five minutes what could go wrong ? Damn ! I did not just say that . Guys , we got a problem . The witch 's brew is down the drain . Aeryn , we got to get out of here . Aeryn ! Oh , God . Does it hurt ? - Mm-hmm . Where ? Where it 's bleeding . Crichton ? When is your fahrbot wormhole due to open again ? Why ? We 've drifted directly atop its coordinates . The Captain says , abandon ship . D 'Argo , can your vessel pull us clear ? Buy us time ? I hardly believe it 's worth the effort . This Leviathan is gone . Lo 'la could move Moya , but is it worth the risk ? Yes . This old demon has isolated the plant-killing compound . Tell them ! Solanterum fobex . Tingles on the palate . Mildly radioactive in quantity . So what ? We 're out of coolant rods . Don 't you people know your own ship ? ! We have solanterum ! Solanterum is a toxic absorbing regulator within Moya 's filter system . Pipes of it run all the way through this ... Okay , okay . We got it already . John , how long till your wormhole ? Too far away to tell . But it 's coming . All right , 1812 . Even spacing , all tiers , no gaps . Cannons set to minimum . Tell all your cousins . Go do it . You sure you wanna be here ? Yup . My skin reflects radiation . We don 't tan , but we don 't burn either . Aeryn ? I believe I 've set a simple control sequence to fire all DRDs simultaneously . All right , come on back . - I 'll stay and activate . Unless you 'll agree to trust Scorpius . No . Aeryn , one word . Radiation . I can handle it . And what about the baby ? Volunteers ? Even minimal ion exposure breaks down three of my internal organs . I doubt I shall survive until I am needed . Okay . Hey , Fluffy . Captain going down with the ship ? You wish . Just don 't frell it up . So , won 't need SPF . You sure this is going to work ? Nope . But Aeryn said it would . Something about you wanting to have more babies ? Fortunate this fungus causes you so much mucus . Excellent . Just hold it steady . Here we go . It 's like a wind tunnel in here . Yeah . Can 't be helped . Filter 's gotta be off and we gotta stop this fan from spinning . All right . Okay . That 'll keep the stuff from getting sucked back in here and being cleansed . We 've gotta keep the mist out of the ship , or we 're toast . You get to it ! That one first . Officer Sun was quite clear in her ... If this goes bad , please die first so my last moment can be joyous . Whoo-hoo ! Ryg ... be ready for my signal . If we ignite the purple haze too soon , the radiation won 't penetrate Moya . Too late , we 'll blast her apart . Acknowledged . It 'll make me stronger . Radioactive mist makes you stronger ? Perhaps my final moments will be joyous . It 's working . We 're pushing Moya clear . D 'Argo , wormhole in four ... three ... dos ... uno ... We 're fine . Thanks for the big warning . Now , get it done . As a single element ? Solanterum needs to be heated to achieve effectiveness . 1812 , poll the brothers . Everybody seeing the mist ? That 's an affirmative . The mist should be through the ship on every tier . - Just go ! All DRDs stand by . Rygel , batter up . Ah ! Wormhole ! Too close to wormhole ! Pilot , calm down . Fire the DRDs ! Rygel ! No , get away ! I 'm trying to help ! Too much chemical and the explosion will destroy us all . Crichton , do you copy ? Damn it , Aeryn , what do you want me to do ? ! Rygel ! Let me go ! Rygel ! Crichton ? ! Gotcha ! - I gotcha . I 'm slipping ! Rygel ! - Pull me back ! Shut off the fans ! What fans ? ! Shut down the fans ! Shut off the fans ! Nobody told me about any fans ! Crichton ! Pull me back ! Pull me back ! I 'm trying ! Please , I 'm slipping ! Oh , fan . Fan . Pip , just hang on ! Rygel , shut the fans off ! I don 't know how ! Pilot , fan ! Fan , fan , fan ! Shut the damn fans off ! Quit wiggling . Just hang on . Frelling fan . You bastard ! How about that ? Did that do anything ? Yeah . The fan 's off . It is ? Yeah . We did it . I did it . Hey , you still got your pants on . Well , that 'd be a first . That 's a good look . Very funny . Very , very funny . The voting for the captaincy is complete . With Moya abstaining and everyone except for Scorpius casting a vote , including myself , our total comes to eight . The tally is as follows . One vote for Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth . One vote for Officer Aeryn Sun . Astonishing as it seems , Scorpius received one vote . One vote was cast for the Divine Eternal . And finally , four votes for our new and deserving Captain ... Ka D 'Argo . Well done . I didn 't want to tell you about the pregnancy until I was sure . Sure you were pregnant , or sure who the father was ? Chiana will be killed . Yeah , it 's Chiana 's fault . Why don 't you blame her ? It 's the other Crichton 's ? There 's no distinction in my mind anymore . Okay , now you 've confused me . All right . Military campaigns can last for many cycles . Imagine if even a portion of a female unit fell pregnant . Those of us born on a Command Carrier can retain an embryonic fetus for up to seven cycles . So , this could be from ... Perhaps four cycles before I met you . And only a surgeon can release the stasis so the baby can grow . And that 's why you left ? I didn 't even make it that far . Aeryn ... I figure a relationship , the kind we 're not having , is based on trust . I 'm so sorry . Yeah . Me , too . 'Cause you don 't trust me . So I don 't know how to trust you . I think I 've earned your trust . I would put my life in your hands . But not my heart . So what 's it going to take ? What do I have to do ? Just come back . When you have your story straight .

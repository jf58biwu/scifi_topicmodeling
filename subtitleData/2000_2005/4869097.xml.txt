 I don 't want it . River , you have to eat . Its good . It tastes like ... - Its good . - It smells like crotch . - Jayne ! - Well , it does . We don 't even have to go someplace fancy . We can just go to the park or something . Feed the pigeons . Sure , feed the pigeons . Probably get the firing squad for littering . - Come on , its not that bad . - It is . Its a core planet . Its spotless . Its got sensors , and there 's Feds . All central planets are the same . Could you please tell my wife the fun she 's missing out on ? Ariel 's quite a nice place , actually . There 's some beautiful muzeums not to mention some fine restaurants . But not boring , like she made it sound . There 's ... Uh ... Uh ... - There 's hiking . - Yeah . And you can go swimming in a bioluminescent lake . Even if its got sunsets 24 hours a day , I ain 't going to that planet . No one is setting foot on that fancy rock . I don 't want anyone leaving the ship . Come to think of it I don 't want anyone looking out the windows or talking aloud . We 're here to drop off Inara . Why come to the core if I can 't even step off the boat ? You could have gotten off with Shepherd at the Bathgate Abbey . Could have been meditating on the wonders of your rock garden by now . It beats just sitting . It is just sitting . - How long will you be planet-side ? - No more than a day or two . Big stop just to renew your license to companion . Can I use companion as a verb ? Its Guild law . All companions are required to undergo a physical examination once a year . Could you not do that while we 're ? Ever ! So two days in a hospital . Thats awful . - Don 't you just hate doctors ? - Hey ! I mean , present company excluded . Lets not be excluding people . Thatd be rude . Son of a ! God ! What the hell ? River , no . - I got the knife . - He 's bleeding . - Thats deep . - He okay ? River . He looks better in red . Gorram freak 's completely off her axle . - I 'm sorry about this . I don 't know ... - Shut it . I ain 't talking to you . She gotta go . Both of them gotta go . Ariel 's as good a place as any to leave them . - Might even pick up a reward . - No one 's getting left . She belongs in a bug house . - You don 't pitch her off now , I swear ... - What ? What do you swear , Jayne ? They don 't get gone , you better start locking up your room at night . Next time she gets in a murdering mood it might be you she comes calling on . Maybe Kaylee or Inara . You let them stay , we 're gonna find out . Finish your work , doctor . This is my boat . They 're part of my crew . No one 's getting left . Best you get used to that . You owe me a shirt . She 's to stay confined to her room at all times , no exceptions . Take her to the kitchen , infirmary , you ask me . Understand ? I do . When I took you and your sister in , the deal was you keep her in check . You can 't hold up your end , we 're gonna have to revisit the deal . She 's getting worse , isn 't she ? Yes . Just look at the bright side . Maybe you 'll meet a young , handsome doctor . He 'll ask you out . Whats the companion policy on dating ? Its complicated . - Well , that figures . - Stay out of trouble . You too . Bye . How we gonna find a job if we don 't leave the ship ? Alliance territory , ain 't any jobs worth having . Where were the last three places we 've been ? My pop always said , " Anyone who can 't find work ain 't looking hard enough . " We ain 't even looking at all . You can stop looking . There 's a client . Me . I have a job for you . You 've got a job for us ? One thatll pay for itself 10 times over . Oh , forget it . We ain 't that desperate . Do you know what this is ? Its a common immune booster called isoprovoline . Street value for a dosage this size 50 platinum , maybe 20 credits . Propoxyn , maybe 80 . Hydrozepam , 200 . And all of these are what I had in the med kit when I came onboard . At a hospital like the one in Ariel City , they 'll have shelves of that stuff . Whatever the take , its more than enough payment for what I have in mind . So the med vault isn 't the job ? Thats the payment . I tell you how to get in , get out and whats worth taking if you help me get River to the hospital 's diagnostic ward . - Whats in the ward ? - A 3-D neuro-imager . If I get River there , I might figure out what they did to her . So we get you both in there and you tell us how to clean out the hospital . - Yes . Not to be negative , but don 't the hospital need that medicine ? Government-run facility . They 'd be restocked in a matter of hours . She 's right . They 'll never miss it . Plus , folks on the rim sure could use it . You know , its very sweet stealing from the rich , selling to the poor but you 're talking about breaking into a secure Alliance facility . How will you get around security ? Well , its not easy , but it can be done . See , like all core hospitals , St. Lucy 's has its own dedicated security force . A small battery of local Alliance Federals substationed here . Now , every floor , every doorway is equipped with sensors and at all points of entry , patient ident scans . However , once clear of the checkpoints , movement within the facility should be relatively unhindered . The standard layout puts the med vault ... Go back to the ident scans . You and your sister are fugitives . How will you get in the building ? Through the front door . Believe me , captain , getting the two of us in is going to be easy . The rest of you , that is going to be the real trick . We 'll need to procure a few items off-ship . I 've made a list . Now , given my status as a fugitive , someone else will have to ... We have some volunteers . Good . And before we make it to the front door , we have to breach the perimeter . Only official vehicles are allowed in , so we 'll need one . Now , obviously , we can 't steal what we need . Any illegal activity in the planning stages could end this thing before it starts . St. Lucy 's Hospital contracts with a local municipal dump yard for all its large disposals . Figures . First time on the core , and what do I get to do ? Dig through trash . Why couldn 't he send me shopping at the Triplex ? Oh , synchronizers . Big hospitals mean big waste , so we shouldn 't have trouble finding what we 're looking for . We 'll have to look like we belong . All we do is slip some bills into the right hands . That gets us uniforms , ID badges and keycards . A little creative forgery , and we 've got ourselves a working alias . Now , all these items are easy to obtain . They 'll get us up to the door . Now , in order to get us in ... Patients were cynical , not responding . - We couldn 't bring him back . - They were cyanotic ... They were cyanotic and unresponsive ... And we 're unable to ... - Resuscitate them . - Yes . - Resuscitate . - Resuscitate them . Which methods did you use ? We tried pulmonary stimulators and cardiac ... - Infusers . - Infusers . - Pulmonary ... - Pulmonary stimulators ... And cardiac infusers . - What about cortical electrodes ? - Oh . We forgot them . - Lets try that again . - Yeah . The pupils were fixed and dilapidated . - Dilated . - Dilated . Dilated ! We got there , and the patients were cyanotic . Not responsive , and we tried to resuscitate them . And despite our best efforts , they kicked . In spite of our best efforts ... - Which methods did you use ? - We tried pulmonary stimulators and cardiac infusers . What about the cortical electrodes ? Whats that ? We applied the cortical electrodes . We used the electromagnetic ... Reaction from ... But unable to get a neural ... Applied cortical electrodes but did not get a neural reaction ... Unable to get a neural ... - Response . - Response . Hell , if I 'd wanted schooling , I 'd have gone to school . I 'll get it . Thats amazing . You two did an incredible job . And now for the finishing touch . If I didn 't know better , I 'd say you were ready to save lives . - Now all we need are a couple patients . - Corpses , actually . For this to work , River and I will have to be dead . I 'm starting to like this plan . We 're going to be asleep . Capt. Reynolds will pretend we 're dead to sneak us into the hospital . Once we 're inside , we 'll wake up , everything will be fine . You understand ? You 're going to suspend cerebral , cardiac and pulmonary activity in order to induce a proto-comatose state . Thats right . - I don 't wanna do it . - I know . I don 't wanna go to that place . I don 't wanna die . No , no one is going to die . The others will take care of us while we 're asleep , and when we get back ... - No , no , no . - Shh , River ? River , its okay . Its okay . This , this could be what we 've been hoping for . When this is over , I 'll be able to help you . I 'll be able to make the nightmares go away . Okay ? Okay . Okay . Lie back . Its time to go to sleep . We speak only when spoken to . We avoid unnecessary contact and stay together until we reach the morgue . - Yes , sir . - Applied cortical electrodes . - Jayne ? - Yeah , yeah , I got it . - Will we have a problem ? - I know what I gotta do . Thats not what I 'm talking about . Will I have a problem with you and Simon ? Its up to him . You got stabbed the other day . Its bound to make anyone a might onerous . - So I figure ... - Its a good plan . What ? Doc did good coming up with that job . Don 't mean I like him better . Nothing buys bygones quicker than cash . Maybe I 'll give him a tattoo while he 's out . Let him do his thing and then get him out . No messing with him . Don 't worry about me . As long as I get paid I 'm happy . Applied the cortical electrodes , unable to get a neural response . Applied the cortical electrodes . We have a few hours before the morning shift . Won 't be an hour . - What do you got ? - We got a couple DOAs . - By the time we got there ... - Take them to the morgue . We applied the cortical electrodes but were unable to get a neural reaction . That should bring them out soon . Once they 're up , get them to the imaging suite let Simon do his thing and haul it back to the rendezvous . - Fifty minutes . - Got it . And I 'll just sit right here . I 'm in . - Do you have the fugitives ? - You got my reward ? Yes , just like we talked about . - Then I got your fugitives . - Good , we 'll see you shortly . Congratulations . You 're about to become a very rich man . Copper for a kiss . Jesus . What did you say ? What the hell 's the matter with you ? Nothing . Its just the aftereffects of the drugs . I 'll be fine . Just give me a second . Well , your sister seems okay . You better get dressed . We gotta move . Two lefts , two rights , and we 're there . You see anyone , smile . - No one smiles in hospitals . - Yes , they do . Its the core . Everyone 's rich and happy here . Why wouldn 't they smile ? Excuse me ? Excuse me ? Hi . - Where are you taking those bodies ? - To the morgue . Downstairs is that way . Right . Must have gotten turned around . Let me see your badge . You 're doing it backwards , walking up the down slide . Keep her quiet . This is the recovery ward . This is where patients come to get better . Going to die . - No one is going to die . - He is . No , he 's not . That man standing next to him is his doctor . - He 's going to help him . - He 's not going to help him right . River , the doctors here are the best in the system . This is one of the top hospitals in the core or anywhere else . Where you should be . - You have to help him . - River , we don 't have time . - He 's killing him . - Code blue . - Stay here . - Don 't you ! Don 't move . What do we have ? 42-year-old , double-bypass post-op . Prognosis , positive . - BP 's 60 / 20 . Pulse is thready . - Who are you ? - He 's crashing . - Get the cart . - We have flat line . - We gotta crack him . We 're not cracking a post-op . - Should I call the code team ? - Get the infusers and . 4 of atropine . - What did you give him ? - Just 20 of apresoline push . Clear . - Clear . - Clear . - He 's going tachy . - But his hearts beating . He 's okay . How do you justify administering a vasoconstrictor to this patient ? - Apresoline is a painkiller not an vaso ... - Unless you combine it with dilaftin . Which any first-year should know is the standard prep medicine your patient took before surgery . Your patient should be dead . Lets go . Walk with me a minute . - Where are we going ? - You see this badge ? It says doctor . I say walk , you walk . - But where are we going ? - You must be new . Don 't get comfortable . Your type doesn 't last long here . When your supervisor hears about the rude and disrespect ... Ah ! Clear . Ready ? 1205 , here it is . Zoe . It must have been demagged . They opened up her skull . Thats a scalpel scar . They ... They opened up her skull , and they cut into her brain . Why ? The only reason to make an incision in someone 's brain is to lobotomize them . To remove damaged tissue . Why anyone would cut into a healthy brain is ... They did it over and over . They stripped her amygdala . Her what ? You know how you get scared or worried or nervous but you don 't wanna be , so you push it to the back of your mind . You try not to think about it . Your amygdala is what lets you do that . Its like a filter in your brain that keeps your feelings in check . She feels everything . She can 't not . Well , thats fascinating . Lets get moving . We still have 20 minutes . The plan changed when you were out . We 're meeting out the back way in five . I could use a few minutes . If we contact Capt. Reynolds ... He gave orders . We play it by the book . River , its okay . Its okay . Get her in the chair and lets go . No . No . No . They come out of the black . They come when you call . - River , its okay . Its over . We 're leaving . - Your toes are in sand . - And your heaïs up your ... - Hey , back off . Make sure her mouth is shut . I don 't need her screeching while we try to get away . Its okay . You should have let me know the plan changed . I told you when you needed to know . What are you griping about ? You got what you came for . No , no , I can 't go back . I don 't wanna go back . Its okay . We 're just going back to the ship . We 're almost home . Federal marshals , don 't move . River and Simon Tam , by the authority of the Union of Allied Planets you are hereby bound by law . Take them to processing . You gonna take me away for questioning now ? How you wanna play it ? You 're under arrest for aiding and abetting federal fugitives . - Better get a lawyer . - You 're kidding , right ? - Where 's my rutting money ? - You mean my money ? For apprehending three fugitives , I expect I 'll be getting it soon . - How much did we get ? - Enough to keep us flying . - Can we fly somewhere with a beach ? - Maybe a naked beach . The job 's not done until we 're back on Serenity . Sorry , sir , didn 't mean to enjoy the moment . Where are the others ? If those officers hadn 't been armed , I think you 'd have had a chance . A guy shoves me , I shove him . Not like I was trying to mount a rescue . Still , I appreciate you trying . You know what I 'd appreciate ? Stop flapping that mouth at me . I 'm trying to figure a way out of here . Can 't do it with you yammering . They took Christmas away . What the hell now ? Came downstairs for the shiny presents . They took the tree and the stockings . Nothing left but coal . Would you shut her up ? Don 't look in the closet either . Its greedy . Its not in the spirit of the holiday . You shut the hell up right now , or so help me , I will shut you up . Time ? - Ten minutes past rendezvous . - Something 's happened . Kaylee , are you linked ? I am now . What do you need ? See if there 's a security alert in the hospital . Hang on . - Maybe they 're late . - Not this late . Jayne would have sent up a flag . Nothing from hospital security or on the local pipeline . Although I am getting some weird chatter from the official 262 . It sounds like they 're talking about ducks . - Code . - Feds got them . Have her bring up a hospital schematic . Find a way into the security substation . Wait a minute , you don 't even know if they 're in there . - Gonna find out . Check . - Coming in clear . So you 're just gonna walk in through the front door ? No , you 're gonna find me a way around back . - Get up . - Whats going to happen to us ? I said , get up . Agent McGinnis , I 'm certain you 're working under a superior who 's keeping close tabs on this case . I know because important people don 't do fieldwork . I 'm also quite certain your superior wants me and my sister alive . Now , I 'm not going to move from this spot until one of two things happens . You answer my very simple question , or you shoot me . We 're transferring you to a holding area until you can be retrieved . Retrieved ? By whom ? People who want you alive . People . Not me . Take them . - Wash , we could use direction here . - Working on it . Kaylee , what do you got ? Tell them to go left when they reach cryo . They 'll see a door . All right , go through that door and down to green level . This is exactly what I didn 't want . I wanted simple . I wanted in and out . I wanted easy money . Things get complicated , don 't they , sir ? Just once I 'd like things to go according to the gorram plan . - Guys , you might wanna hurry . - Oh , is there a problem ? I think the reinforcements just arrived . - What are you doing ? - Going out the way we came in . - There are four armed Feds out there . - Six , I know . - We run . - You got no idea where that goes . - We 'll find our way . - I ain 't chancing that . I can handle the Feds . Doesn 't matter . They 're here . Gentlemen , that was prompt . We 're almost finished here . Prisoners will be out in a minute . Let me get the paperwork together for you . Bobby , bring that here . Not that itll mean much . The men were tightlipped . The girl was spewing gibberish . We got it all down . You spoke to the prisoners ? Well , yeah . Had to process them . There was no interrogation , if thats what you mean . Didn 't do your job for you . - Did your men also speak with them ? - As much as they had to . What the hell is that ? Two by two . Hands of blue . Two by two . Hands of blue . Two by two . Hands of blue . - Where the hell 's she going ? - Must be some sort of exit this way . I don 't see no exit . - Dead . - This one 's alive . I won 't run around like a rat in a maze till we 're dead . Now , we 're going back . Almost there . Almost there . Almost there . There . Stand back . Come here . Shee-niou high-tech Alliance crap ! Hey , Inara . How was your checkup ? Same as last year . Whats going on here ? Lets see , we killed Simon and River , stole a bunch of medicine . Now the cap and Zoe are springing the others got snatched by the Feds . Oh , there they are now . Tell me we weren 't followed . Nothing in our rear-view the whole way back . All right . - Take us out , quick as you can . - We 'll be out of atmo in five minutes . Hey , how was your thing ? As advertised , lots of needles and cold exam tables . I heard you had some excitement . Nothing much . Lots of running around , a little gunplay . A couple needles . Next time we 're here , I 'll stay with the preacher . If you hadn 't come , you wouldn 't be getting your payday . So get what you needed ? I think I did . I have the information off the imager . I just have to go over it , and I 'm hopeful . - What happened to your face ? - Huh ? - Ow . - Oh , nothing . He was amazing . I can 't even begin to tell you . We wouldn 't be standing here if it weren 't for him . Thank you . Well , hey , you 're part of my crew . I think I might cry . All right . Jayne , help me with the cargo . Everyone , make yourselves useful . You got jobs , go do them . This has gotta be our best take ever . Well , doc had a good notion . The boy 's got a decent criminal mind . So , what are you buying with your cut ? Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? The job is done . I figured it was time for a little chat . It seems to me we had a solid plan . Smooth , you might say . But what I can 't figure out is , what you were doing around the back exit . What ? I couldn 't go out the front . I had to improvise . Open the damn door ! You called the Feds . What ? I got pinched . Which is what happens when you call the Feds . No . I would never do that . My hand to God . May he strike me down as I 'm standing here . Well , you won 't be standing there long . Minute we break atmo , you 'll be thinner once you get sucked out that hole . - Come on , Mal ! - Leaving atmo in 2 minutes . - That ain 't no way for a man to die . - Secure cargo door . You wanna kill me , shoot me . Just let me in . I hear tell they used to keelhaul traitors back in the day . I don 't have a keel to haul you on , so ... Okay . I 'm sorry , all right ? Sorry for what , Jayne ? I thought you 'd never do such a thing . Money was too good . I got stupid . I 'm sorry , okay ? Be reasonable . What are you taking this so personal for ? It ain 't like I ratted you out to the Feds . But you did . You turn on any of my crew , you turn on me . Since thats a concept you can 't wrap your head around then you got no place here . You did it to me , Jayne , and thats a fact . - What are you gonna tell the others ? - About what ? About why I 'm dead . I haven 't thought about it . Make something up . Don 't tell them what I did . The next time you decide to stab me in the back have the guts to do it to my face . Can I come in ? Hi . What are you doing ? Drawing . Thats really good . What are you doing ? I ... I brought some medicine . Do you remember why we went to the hospital ? Is it time to go to sleep again ? No , mei mei . Its time to wake up .

 This is a story of the past and the future . We will come to the future , but first , the past . Here we have the Earl of Warwick . We can see by his petulantly arched brow that he is not en route to a good deed . Do you wish to live , old witch ? You have committed grave crimes against God and your king . - Have mercy , my lord . - Silence . The Frenchman , Count Thibault , shall wed Lady Rosalind , the daughter of our king . I desire that woman . - l alone am fit to take her hand . - And her castle , her lands . The riches that are her dowry . Thou art not as stupid as thou art hideous , old hag . Tomorrow night , the king shall feast the arrival of the count . I want the count dead before the feast is over . A small fortune in gold awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding . Not so fast ! How shall I know thy magic is sufficient to the task ? Dost thou find proof enough in this ? That will do ! Take it , witch ! Was that proof enough , my lord ? Come to the king 's castle tomorrow , and carry out my plan . If you fail you will be burned . Our hero , of course , knew none of this . He was safely in his entourage , traveling , he thought , to his wedding . Here he is , the Count of Malfete . He is also a duke , a baron and a lord . A nobleman , plagued by only those small things which inconvenience a knight : The permanentpresence of his sisters , his mother and father and , as all knights must endure an idiotservant , André , whose smell made people faint . A considerable achievement among a population who never bathed . Down , peasant ! The duke , or Thibault , as his subjects weren 't allowed to call him , wasjoyous . The long-awaited day of his marriage had come atlast . What have we got here ? Another lot of bloody royal bastards ? Must be the French duke , come to marry the king 's daughter . Mind the forest ! There be dragons 'll make dinner from your bones in there ! André loved and protected his master . Master . Master ! The forest ! It is haunted . Thibault responded . Thank you , master . With every step , he came closer to the castle of his beloved . He hoped he would be with hersoon . For rare was thejourney in which Thibault did not have to stop and rescue someone . This was no exception . Forlike his ancestors , he lived by an ancient family rule . A woman in distress ! The only one he knew . Beware , sire . Courage was more than a duty . Courage was his creed . Join your master ! I 'm talking to you . Go ! Stupid peasant . Sire ! Behind you ! Naturally ... Courage is our creed ! ... he was invincible . Except he was notinvincible against witchcraft . For this would be his last victory in this millennium . I hear a rumor thou art marrying tomorrow , my lord . I have heard this rumor . I have also heard that the bride is the most beautiful in all of England . - But it is not true . - lt is not ? No . Am I not the most beautiful bride in all of England ? No . Wait . The most beautiful bride in all the world . Wear this for me , Thibault . Wear it against thine heart . Thou shalt always be true . Lady Rosalind . Thy shalt not disgrace thyself before the wedding . I must hie and dress for the banquet . Sire , your bride looks like a gorgeous sparrow . Silence , you impudent peasant . Show respect to your future mistress . Yes , master . Thank you , my lord ! Quite so , Your Majesty . When thy lady drinks her wine , her eyes will fill with hellish visions . The count will appear as a hideous beast . Then , my magic will compel her to kill him . My dear friends and noble guests Thibault , Count of Malfete and Papincourt , I hereby declare this castle a wedding present . Hear ye , Your Majesty . In every way that I am able I will serve my beautiful lady and do honor to thy kingdom . Drink of my cup , and you will know my thoughts . And thou wilt know mine . My lord . My lord ! What is it , Thibault ? This is not the kind of behavior that becomes a duke . Are you crazy ? Drunk ? This is no way to behave in an English court . Beasts from hell ! That is my mother ! That is my mother . Demon ! What have I done ? It is not me ! It is witchcraft . André , find me a wizard ! - France must pay for this treachery . - Find me a wizard ! Have pity on the poor condemned man . We 're here for the last rites . My lord , we have to hurry . What wizard is this ? He 's English , my lord . But his magic is very good . - Your Earl of Warwick did this to me . - indeed , he did . And he 'd have me , too , if he knew that I was here . I beg you , let him save you . Can you bring my lady back from the dead ? I can reanimate her corpse but I don 't think that my lord would like how she looks , or smells . There is another way . Time is like a mountain riddled with tunnels . I can open one of these tunnels for thee and return thee to the moment before the murder if thy will is strong enough . Don 't you think this priest has had enough time ? Hurry up , Father . Unlock this door ! Now ! Drink this potion , my lord and thou shalt descend into the mountain of time . It smells awful . You should not drink that . What if you become a frog , or goat 's feet ? You are right . Drink first , bastard . If you die , I will avenge your death . What are you doing in there ? Open this door ! Open this door ! - lt tastes like the shit of the pork . - And he should know . I forgot the grouse eggs. lt 's a disaster . I 've lost them in the corridors of time . Open this door ! Open this door ! - This is cool . - This is pretty cool . Yeah . See the peasant sleeping on the floor ? In those days , people didn 't think peasants deserved better than that . And they were considered the property of their masters . Now , the boss of this peasant is the knight . See how beautiful the knight 's clothing is ? Miss Ferdette , that one is hot , and it just snorted . That 's impossible , because they 're just mannequins . - Mannequins don 't snort . - Well , that one just did . No , because they 're not real . They 're just like dolls . - Shit ! - What are you doing in my chamber ? Your chamber has been cleaved in half , my lord . This is not the castle ! Look at this , sire. lt is satanic . This is hell . And we are condemned souls . Come . We shall find the prince of this netherworld and beg his mercy . Wait for me , my lord . Dr. Brady , come quick . Two guys with swords and armor- - Miller , you 're always overreacting . Relax . There 's absolutely no need to ... . The police are on their way . Peasant , please show me the way out of this strange castle . They stink . Have a nice day . - Wait . - Good luck . Peasant ! Wait ! What is this ? The gates of Hell . Look at its eyes of fire . It 's a red dragon . Attack ! What the hell are you doing ? Take that , beast . We have killed it . Yes , it is no longer breathing . God is punishing us for practicing the black arts . Let us pray for forgiveness . Heavenly Father , forgive us our sins . We are so , so so sorry . - Dr . Brady . - Julia . This is Julia Malfete , who heads the Medieval Art department . She donated the 12th-century castle exhibit . Julia designed the exhibit where we found the two men . That stuff is a result of the body search . The big guy had the gold coins the sword , the shield and that ring . The little guy had the salt pork , the sausage dagger molar and that box , which he probably stole . But not from us . Most thieves take valuable things , not bring them . This is a Gothic pyxis . This design was made in Canterbury at the end of the 12th century . It has emeralds and rubies . Why did they sleep here ? They could have stayed at the Ritz . You got these out of their pockets ? That 's right . Except the sausage . This stamp ring is fantastic . My family 's coat of arms . Sergeant , can I meet these thieves ? Master , I 'm hungry . My tummy rumbles like a beast . How can you think of food after such tragedy ? Yes . What I would not give to see once more my precious . My lord , look ! She 's alive ! Rosalind . My fair Rosalind . My bride . - My ravishing flower . - Mistress . My mistress . - What are you doing ? - lt is a miracle . - Do I know you ? - Do you not recognize me , my lady ? I am the Count of Malfete and Papincourt , Duke of Anjou . I am your faithful Thibault . - You 're who ? - And I 'm André le Pâté , valet of the count . Please forgive me for what I did to you , my dear Rosalind . My name isn 't Rosalind. lt 's Julia . No ! You are my Rosalind . The lock of hair you gave me on our wedding day . I carry it over my heart . Please , my love , see for yourself . You see ? It is the color of wheat on a summer 's day , the color of candlelight . It is your own . - Stop this . Stop this . - Step away from the lady . I think you 'd be safer outside . - Do not be afraid ! - You don 't want to see this . Courage is our creed ! Courage is our creed ! Stop ! I know this man . " Courage is our creed . " That 's our family motto . This man is my cousin . It 's in here . You see , I thought he was dead . He disappeared when a storm capsized his yacht , during the Admiral 's Cup . They never recovered his body , so the courts declared him dead . He was a very distant French cousin of mine but as the last living Malfete , I inherited his estate . If he 's your cousin , what do you want me to do with him ? Sire , why does Lady Rosalind call herself Julia and allow us to be beaten and chained ? Peasant , this is not our time . The wizard did not send us into the past . He sent us into the next millennium . We are 30 generations removed from Malfete . Julia is not my beloved . She 's my descendant . Descendant ? Could you get me Hunter , please ? It 's important . That rabbit of yours is on the phone again . Hey , bunny . What 's up ? Thibault Malfete just showed up at the museum . Thibault Malfete ? That 's impossible . Isn 't he supposed to be- l know . - Are you sure it 's him ? He looks like his photos . He quoted the family motto . Does he know yet that we 're selling his entire estate ? Well , it 's hard to say what he knows . He 's a little strange . Hunter , this is terrible . I mean , it 's wonderful that he 's alive but it 's terrible that we 're already selling the estate. I feel awful . The courts declared him dead . We 're within our legal rights . How were we supposed to know he was still alive ? Has he mentioned anything about money ? - Money ? - Money . How can you worry about money ? I 'm worrying about you . You don 't handle surprises well . Where is your cousin now ? - He and his friend are with security . - Why don 't we bring them home with us ? He 's family , right ? We want to be hospitable . - You 're wonderful . - l 'll pick you all up in five minutes , okay ? Love you . ' Bye , bunny . 'Bye , big bear . My God . Thibault Malfete is still alive . This is a disaster . You 're pouting . - l hate it when you call her " bunny . " - You are so much hotter than a bunny . My God , look at yourself . You 're a tigress . Lady Julia , there has been a terrible mistake . - l 'm so sorry . We thought you were dead . - Dead ? No , the wizard was a fool , but not a killer . He only sent us the wrong way . - Excuse me ? - We fell into the mountain of time . I must return to my time to prevent a great tragedy to our family . - l ask for your assistance . - l 'll do whatever I can . Awful . We must not go out ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? We have to wait outside . Hunter can 't park here . We have to wait for him . My God . Bloody coward . We have to- - Those boys are lost . I must go and retrieve them . - This is England ? - Meat . - No-- - Meat ! - This is Chicago . - Meat , meat , meat . This is the United States . The last I remember , I was in Sussex , England , in my castle chambers . - You don 't remember anything since then ? - No . Do you think maybe you 've suffered some memory loss , from the accident ? After I drank the potion , I remember nothing . - Onions ? - All of them . All right . You like to eat hot dogs ? I like to eat every kind of dog . Hey , wait . What are you doing ? No , no . Stop , stop . Please , stop . I 'm sorry. I 'm so very sorry . - He 's French. I 'm sorry . - Very . Hi , honey . - Situation 's much worse than I thought . - What are you talking about ? Bonjour . Holy shit . Hunter , this is Thibault Malfete . - Thibault , this is my fiancé , Hunter . - Pleased to meet you . - Are you noble ? - No , sorry . But I can certainly tell that you are . And this is André , Thibault 's assistant . Hello , big nose . - Run behind the chariot , peasant . - Yes , master . - No . He can 't run behind the car . - He can 't ride with us . He 's not noble . - He has to ride in the car . - He 's very fast . We 're taking the freeway . You can run 70 miles an hour , can you ? - l have good boots . - No , you must sit in the car . Please . - l 'm fast . - l 'd love to see you run sometime . - Obey . - Yes , my lord . Do you want some dog ? Too fast . - Are you okay , Mr. Pâté ? - Yes . - Too fast . - Honey , could you just slow down a little ? - l 'm going 22 miles an hour . - Yes , I know . Could you try going 21 ? What is the matter with you ? You don 't know how to drive ? Go . What ? It 's going to be fine . Get in and open the door . Let 's go inside . Hi , sweetie . Hello , Churchill . Give Mom a high five . All right , that 's my boy . Let 's go . Like the hat . Angelique ! - l need you now ! - Come here , peasant . - Chop-chop . - Okay. I 'm coming . Hurry up . How did you do that ? Night . Day . Night . Day . - l do not have this in my castle . - You don 't have power ? I have the power to judge and condemn to death any villain on my land . Really ? Hunter will be so jealous . I 'm going to get you two something to drink . And make Hunter one of his " power dude " smoothie things . I 'd offer you one , but nobody seems to like them but him . Night . Day . Night . - Day . Night . Day . - André , could you please stop that ? I 'm just starting to feel like I 'm in a disco , you know ? My dear lady . You said you would offer me your assistance . - Anything . What do you need ? - l need to find a wizard . - Sorry , master . - Idiot ! Apologize to the lady ! Sorry , master. I ask for mercy . - Forgive me , my lady . - No , it 's okay . The floor needed to be cleaned , anyway . You were saying something about what ? Did you say , " a wizard " ? - l need to go back into the tunnels of time . - Of course . I need to understand what happened to you , all right ? - Now , your yacht went down in a storm- - - No . You must listen . I am from the time of Thibault Vl , and I have come to the future . Okay . The tunnels of time , wizards , Thibault Vl . - Are you okay ? - Yes , lady . Lovely flower I see that you do not believe me . It is a pity . But , please , try . Yes , of course I 'll try . - She 's green . - Never did like the taste of this . My God . - What happened ? - Nothing . I 'm eating this very good meat with vegetables in a fine sauce . I will shit easy tomorrow . It 's jet lag . I 'm sure you would like to wash your hands and whatever else . Come with me . All right . Here you go . Can I talk to you for a moment , please ? Don 't be bashful with the soap . What is it , master ? A throne ? It could be . - They 're crazy ! - They 've been through a terrible ordeal . - They have amnesia . - Amnesia ? They 're wacked . They 're completely retarded . They 're ... . Clean water . The long towel has a good fragrance . Thibault is my cousin , Hunter . - He 's my family . - Yeah ? I 'm not so sure . He doesn 't strike me as being noble . Julia , will you come down here ? It 's kind of an emergency . Very good fountain . Your French relatives are bathing in the toilet . Oh , my God . Toothbrushes . I 'll just leave them right here . Be right back . I 'm going to take a shower , then tackle that kitchen . Hurry . Our reservation 's at 8 : 00 . - Where are we going ? - Latour . Isn 't that a little formal for our guests ? You tell me your cousin is nobility . Then you get mad at me when I suggest that maybe he 's not . Now you 're upset because I pick the best restaurant in town ? You make it impossible for me to do the right thing . You 're right . Latour will be great . Thank you , big bear . I 'll be in the shower . Very good flavor . This is not wine , ignorant peasant . It is oil for the bath . Very good perfume . Very creamy . - Bathe , servant . - No , sire . I have taken a bath at Christmas . - Bathe ! - No. I 'm afraid ! I don 't want to catch cold and die ! Be silent , peasant . Do you have another bottle of this bathing oil for André ? You realize the bath you took cost over $ 2,000 ? That 's American dollars . - ls that a lot ? - Yes . Then I will repay you with one of my swines . That sounds fair . My family tree . So many descendants . Hello ? - Mr . Cassidy , please . - Yeah , hold on one second . - Yeah , bunny ? - Honey . - Your office . - l 'll take it upstairs . Hello ? Oh , who is this ? André le Pâté , I have big balls and my ass breathes fire . Wow , that must hurt . - Hello . - Hello . - I told you never to call me hereI - Well , I forgot . is somebody there with you ? Jesus . Get off the phone , or I 'll call the policeI He hung up . It was Thibault 's retarded assistant . This is dangerous . I 'll call you after Julia goes to bed . Lady Julia . You are more than a rose . You are love 's own flower . That 's ridiculous . This old thing , I threw it on , I haven 't worn it in a couple of years , but I guess I should learn how to take a compliment . Thank you . Almost . Thank you . Much better . Kissing cousins . I don 't think I 've ever seen anyone eat a steak in two bites before . Thank you , master ! Be blessed . - Thank you . - Would you like some more truffle sauce ? Excuse me but the gentleman can 't eat off the floor . He 's not a gentleman . He 's my servant and he 's not worthy of our company . - Thank you . - l 'm sorry , sir . Would you please join us at the table ? - lt is not possible . - Please . Thibault , please . Let him sit at the table . For me ? I will please you , lovely one . Obey , foolish pork . Thank you . To think , you were worried they wouldn 't be comfortable here . The floor wasn 't such a bad place for him . - Easier to hose down . - Cheese ! Very good cheese ! André , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? André , no . No . Bad . Sit down . Eat this . This is for dessert . - No , sir . Please . - l 'm terribly sorry . It 's all right . Just add it to the check , okay ? Thank you . You eat this after dinner , all right ? I 'm terribly sorry . Just add it to the bill . Thank you . Do I have something on my face ? You remind me of the daughter of a king . Thank you . While we 're on the subject of Julia 's noble ancestry you see why she was given control of the estate . Julia is a Malfete . Everything I have is hers . You have no objection if she retains control . - No . - Wonderful . I 'm sure you 'll be pleased with our plans . They 're going to make us ... . l mean , you and Julia , very wealthy . I am already wealthy . I own hundreds of horses 10 chests of pepper , 400 bags of wool and 50 barrels of Spanish olives . - And you own me , sire . - Yes . But you have no value . That is true . Excuse you . Leave nothing for the devil ! - Did you hear what I heard ? - Yes , I did . They 're not in very good health . Try to ignore it if you can . - Sire . - What ? I have to make pee-pee . - You want to pee ! - Yes . - Outside ! - Outside ? But , sire ... - ... I could be eaten by wolves . - Find a torch ! Idiot . Find a torch . André has such simple needs . That 's great . You need some help , sir ? It is beautiful . The water comes out by itself . It is a magic fountain . Look at this ! It smells just like the forest ! All the forest is in this small wheel . - Smell it ! - No , thank you . - Don 't want to smell it ? - Enjoy yourself . The castle is a wreck so I 'm helping her divide the estate into more profitable chunks . We 're selling the art and various high-end pieces through our outlet here . Essentially , I 'm protecting her . That is my role . - And the land ? - l decided we should sell that , too . It is not for you to decide . Only Lady Julia can say what will be done . I speak for both Julia and myself . You cannot possibly speak for a Malfete . What are your wishes , my lady ? I guess I 'd like to think about it a little bit more , actually . The lady has spoken ! Greasy chicken . What on earth are you doing ? I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to add an order of chicken á la umbrella to your bill . Smell the forest . Yes , it 's minty . It 's from the blue fountain . Honey , would you like a mint ? - Sire Hunter . - Thibault ? Master ? These are good . Give me another . Very minty . Good evening , fine sir . I 'm seeking Thibault of Malfete , the Duke of Anjou . The great chevalier ? André does not need a bed . He will be happy with some straw . André does not need a bed . He will be happy with some straw . - Yes . - We 're out of straw . My bed is soft . It 's time for the Family Feud introducing the Fry family . Poor little people . They 're trapped inside ! God have mercy . - What are we going to do ? - Free them . Let 's start the Family Feud . Bunny ? - You really think they have amnesia ? - l don 't know . We are coming ! So you admit they 're clinically insane . - l didn 't say that . - Oh , come on . Where did they go , my lord ? They were inside . - We could not save them . - lt is tragic . We never really use this room anyway . It 's a pity . I need to find a wizard now . Do you mind if I get some coffee first ? Do you mind if I get some coffee first ? Jesus Christ ! I told you not to leave this stuff in the middle of the driveway ! - l about broke my goddamn neck ! - l 'm sorry. I didn 't mean to . Do you actually do any gardening here or do you just sing out of tune ? Just clean it up . Big belly . You dare to touch a lady ? - Who the hell are you ? - l 'm André and I piss on you . Get out of here , or I 'll call the cops ! Apologize to the lady . You 're calling her- - Lady . Right . - Sorry . - Kiss her feet . - Do what ? - Kiss her feet ! Instead of a wizard , what we need to find you is a good doctor . Instead of a wizard , what we need to find you is a good doctor . Wizards are the best doctors . What in the world is that ? - Call 911 . - What is going on here ? He was very rude to the lady . Look , fool . A coat of arms . He 's a nobleman . I did not know . - Stupid peasant . - Who are these guys ? - Visitors . - Do you own this woman ? She works for me . I 'll hang my valet by his feet on your behalf . Please , my lord , not by the feet ! I prefer the thumbs . I got a meeting to catch . Rise , idiot . I give him to you for the day . You may beat him if you like . Thanks but , you know , we just met . Thank you , my great and merciful master . Thank you , my lord . Let us go . We have a wizard to find . A wizard . - Are you French ? - Yes . - You like it here ? - lt is strange . It smells bad , and the food is little . But the ladies are wonderful . I wish my boss thought like that . Boss . What is boss ? The guy you work for . The big guy . I can have his bones when he 's eating . That is so disgusting . That 's so gross . You have to figure out a way to get away from him . He 's my master , I don 't want to be hung . - Hung ! - You 're not going to be hung ! That 's against the law ! Okay ? Does he pay you a lot of money ? Once every month , he permits me to hunt pheasants on his lands . You make no money ? I have a treasure . What do you call that again ? - The " L. " - The " L. " Wait . Before we get downstairs into the crowd , I 've got this for you . Here 's my phone number . Wear this just in case you get lost . I will not get lost . You can only be lost if you have no purpose . I have purpose , which is to find a- - A wizard . Right . I don 't know where to start with that one . I mean , I have never met a wizard . I don 't even think they make wizards anymore . Oh , my purse ! Wait ! Thibault ! - No ! - Take the purse ! He 's a thief. I have to cut his hand . No ! Please , just take it . Everything is fine now . Hang him in the public square . Silence , old woman ! You 're not helping . Wait ! Old witch . I am sorry. I thought you were an old hag . I 've been called worse . Why don 't you come and tell her- - Oh , no . Would you happen to know a wizard ? - Can you tell me where to find a wizard ? - l 'm in a hurry . Peasants , which one of you can show me to a wizard ? There will be a reward . Sir Lancelot is looking for a wizard . Aren 't we all ? I am not Lancelot . I am Thibault , Count of Malfete Duke of Anjou , Baron of Orléans Lord of Libourne . Well , I 'm Sid from Cicero . Duke of Hazzard , Baron of Billiards and Lord of Lord Knows What . And I challenge you to a duel . En garde . - Do not make me kill you . - En garde , I say . Watching this , honey ? I should kill you for your insolence but I am too thirsty , so instead I will quench my thirst and yours and yours . Drink up . You 're not going to believe this . Guess whose exhibit had another visitor last night . There was just sparks flying and all sorts of weird noises . Then there was this ... . - A green flash and bang , he was there . - Who ? The wizard-looking dude . - Wizard , wizard . - Look . He burnt the bedspread where he came in . - Absolutely shocking . - Wait a minute . This wasn 't here before . He says he 's Julia 's cousin . I say he 's a fake . I want an answer in 24 hours . See , Tiger ? Daddy will take care of this business . You going to be nice to me again ? - Hello . - Hunter , you won 't believe this . - l 'm here for you . - I lost Thibault . I lost him because he was looking for a wizard . And then he just freaked out . Nobody just loses a guy dressed like a medieval knight in Chicago . Well , I did . Hold on a second . Hello ? Does anybody there know the Count of Whoop-dee-do ? - The Baron of Blah-dee-blah ? - Yes , I do . Wonderful . Thank you . I found him . Got to go . - l 'm so relieved . - Love you . ' Bye . So , he 's back ? I was hoping he 'd tripped on his cape and swan dived into the Chicago River . Thibault ! Thibault ! Everybody , everybody . This is my great-great-great-great-great granddaughter . Grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grandpa and I must go . You have to sing first . Yeah , you got to sing . Yes , you must sing first . We , we , we have to go . Now , now , now . - Why ? - Yeah , you have to give us a reason . - l found a wizard . - Well , bring him along ! - We have to go . - l knew it ! I must leave you now . So long , Lancelot . I am not Lancelot . I am Thibault , Count of Malfete . Of course , it is that bloody English wizard . He has followed me through time . Right. I mean , he probably whipped up some eye-of-newt potion thingy and he waved his hands and said some words in Latin ... - ... and voilá . - Voilá . I 'm starting to believe you . To believe everything , and that is a really big leap for a 21st-century girl . I want you to appreciate that . There it is . All right . What do you want now ? Treacherous old fool . What is this ? I thought you smote her . - She 's not my Rosalind . - l 'm Julia Malfete . Malfete . She 's a descendant . All is not lost , my lord . How long until your magic is ready to return me to my rightful time ? Before the sun is set . Then let us go now and fetch my faithful servant . Never smelled like this before . Bloody English wizards . They cannot do anything right . - l like your chariot . - Thank you . That 's my lipstick . No , André . That 's so gross . Hurry up . Spit it out the window . One ruby . That should do it . $ 25,000 . - What is all this horrible noise ? - We would love to go shopping . Big swans . Very small chariots . Like little Matchbox cars . Say cheese ! I love these wheel cakes . We call them doughnuts . André , you can have as many doughnuts as you want now . - Yes . - You can have all of this , André . You could go out and get a big house and you could have a swimming pool . You could have everything , André . I can only have what my master allows . That is not true ! This is a democracy . This is America . You are a free man . Thank you . There are a lot of good things about living in this time . You 'll be okay here . I 'll make sure of it . You are lionhearted , Julia , like the women of your lineage . You have courage . Lionhearted . No , I don 't think so . Bunny-hearted maybe , but ... . Come outside . You will learn to protect yourself . What are you doing ? Look at me . Take it like this . Power in your arm . - Very impressive . - Take it . Power is in my arms . I can 't do it . - lt 's too heavy . - Try again . I am getting so tired of sneaking around and lying all the time . Hang in there with me , babe . We are so close . Take me dancing . Hey , watch it ! I 'm sorry . Look what you 've done . Let 's go . Come on . Sorry about that. I 'm sorry . Sorry , ma 'am . Don 't help me . My boss will kill me . You are a free woman . Tonight we dance . Hunter . - Angelique . - Where 's Julia ? Hunter ! Get your groove in ! - Who are you ? - Who is she ? - She 's my sister . - l 'm not ! She 's very tired and has to go home . Sire Hunter ! - Tonight was so great . - Greatest night ever in the world . You make me feel like a lady . - But you are a great lady . - And you are a great man . Really ? And if you got a decent haircut and not put everything you see in your mouth I think you 'd be a terrific man . My lady , thank you . André , what do you say that we quit our lousy jobs and go travel around the world ? - Quit ? - We could be so happy . Tonight you should just tell your boss that you quit . - Okay ? - Okay . - Be free . - Free ! - Because I am a free man ! - You got that right , baby . Master . You are worried . - What is wrong ? - The wizard . He exploded . Yes . Wasn 't a very pretty sight . The wizard exploded ? I don 't know about you guys , but good night . First , André has something to say to Thibault . What is it , peasant ? Well , speak . Nothing. I guess I was wrong . Thibault was standing by the river it was the saddest , most beautiful thing I 'd ever seen . Well , that Thibault really is a special guy . Yes , he is . That 's why I 've decided to give the entire estate back to him . You what ? Honey did you know that the women in my lineage are all lionhearted ? They still haven 't brought the stiff down ?

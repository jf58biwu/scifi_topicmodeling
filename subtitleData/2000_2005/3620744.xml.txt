 Damn , Jim , you fell asleep ? We 're on a stakeout , man . - l guess. I don 't know . - What happened over there ? - What are you talkin ' about ? - That house , man . The front door was wide open . How long you been out ? We 'd better check it . Lights out . Door 's open . I don 't like this . Looks like they all left . I 'm not so sure . This can 't be . Oh , God . Stedman . They 're all dead . Yeah ? It 's Agent Scully. I 'm sorry to wake you . - What 's up ? - l got a call from Assistant Director Skinner . - He has a situation . - What is it ? An agent is dead . Skinner had him surveilling a religious cult in Pittsburgh . All the followers are dead as well . - What happened ? - He 's having difficulty determining that . - l 'll pick you up . - l 'm sorry , Agent Doggett. I can 't go . Agent Scully ? Something unexpected has come up . - You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Will I see you later ? - As soon as I can . Ms Scully ? The doctor wants to see you right away . - Where 's Agent Scully ? - Running late . What do we have ? Our man doing routine surveillance on a cult , the lbogan Temple . We had a tip they were trafficking narcotics . Nobody suspected anything like this . Agent James Leeds . Six-year veteran of the Bureau , father of two . A patrol cop found him . Car was locked from the inside . - Nobody saw or heard anything ? - No . This couldn 't have happened here . Blood splatter on the seat says it did . It 's too narrow . There 's no room to swing the weapon . - No . - Besides , it doesn 't make any sense . The gun 's still holstered , and the key 's in the ignition . Even if he fell asleep ... This is damn weird . It gets weirder . These people were all killed the same way as our guy . All 20 cult members dead from a single deep wound to the forehead . - ls this every member ? - Except one . Their leader , Anthony Tipet , is missing . Tipet was a convicted murderer who claimed to have found God . We didn 't think we were dealing with an apocalyptic cult . We 've seen this kind of thing before . Jonestown . Heaven 's Gate . However devoted they were , they wouldn 't just let their leader bash their brains in . At least one of ' em would 've had a problem with it . I 've considered that . I 'm running tox tests for drugs . Does that include our man in the car ? AD Skinner ? We 're still unable to locate Agent Stedman . - Angus Stedman ? - Leeds ' partner . Do you know him ? - Where 'd you look ? - He wasn 't at Leeds ' motel . He 's not answering his cell or his pager . - Did you check his condo ? - His condo ? Stedman 's from Pittsburgh . He keeps a condo here that belonged to his folks . Angus Stedman , it 's John Doggett . Doggett . The body is but clay . A shell made by God to hold the twin aspects of the Holy Spirit : light and dark . If we have the courage to see into darkness , we see into God ... free of the clay which confines us . Tipet served 12 years for the bludgeoning death of his wife . He then became a minister , preaching a hybrid of evangelical and Eastern religions . He said a higher plane could be reached by the via negativa - the path of darkness - the plane closer to God . Once reached it would let the spirit travel unhindered . Tipet believed hallucinogens would lead him to this plane . Specifically , compounds of the bark of an African tree . The iboga . All these people were so stoned on this bark , they just let their leader kill them ? We found no trace of the drug in the blood of any victim . I don 't understand . How in the hell did Tipet manage to slaughter all these people ? He was paranoid , but nothing says he wanted to take the lives of his people or our men . This is our one and only suspect . Are you telling me he didn 't do it ? Whoever did this left not even a trace how . No prints , no forensic evidence whatsoever . Agent Leeds ' sedan , the cult house , Agent Stedman 's condo ... were all locked from the inside . That 's impossible . Unless Tipet took the drug and succeeded . Unless his consciousness was there but his body was somewhere else . The X-File explanation . I take it this theory comes from Agent Scully ? Agent Scully has yet to reach any conclusions , sir . That 's the problem. I 'm not hearing conclusions from either one of you . If this man has " reached a higher plane , " then explain to me why 22 people are dead , including two fbi agents . Now , I wanna hear what you 're gonna do about it . If I 'm working this case , give me a heads-up before you tell him more science-fiction stories . I don 't have another explanation . Those guys in there are right . This whole story doesn 't make a damn bit of sense . I 'm supposed to give those guys answers . You 're supposed to help me do that . Tipet 's on the run . Find him , and we just might . - Spare change ? - l don 't have anything . Sorry . Come on , man. I know you got somethin ' , cos l hearjinglin ' in your pocket . You don 't wanna know me . Pick up the phone , damn you . Pick up the damn phone . You did this . You did this . God help you , Andre . I can 't . Agent Doggett . Coroner 's report . " Victims all killed by a single blow from an ax blade , six to eight inches long . " The photos of wound patterns don 't match up to any known make or manufacturer . This fit the description ? It 's a ceremonial ax used a thousand years ago to cleave the skulls of unbelievers . - lt was required reading for Tipet 's followers . - ls this our weapon ? No , sir. lt 's on permanent display in a Calcutta museum . Another dead end . Like everything else in this case . I 'm a good investigator , but I 'm not the agent that should be investigating ' this case . Agent Scully can 't be here . - You spoke to her ? - Tonight . She told me to tell you she 's fine . She 's taking some personal time . I 've got 22 people dead , and she 's takin ' personal time ? You 're not listening to what I 'm telling you . Do your best without her . Spare change ? I 'll take whatever you got . No . - Sir ? - l think we caught a break . A homeless man was found dead in Pittsburgh two hours ago . - l had them e-mail me some digital photos . - Any witnesses ? A man fitting Tipet 's description used the pay phone . - So we got somethin ' ? - There 's no evidence . - There 's no fingerprints , no fibers ... - You got him at the scene . There 's nothing to link him to the murder . I 'm supposed to believe this guy doped his way into another plane of reality ? That his spirit is goin ' around killing ' people ? All right , just suppose that this drug finally did what Tipet said it would . That his spirit could be in one place while his body was in another . Then tell me why he 's doin ' it . If he 's lookin ' for God , why is he killing ' people ? Just cos l 'm on the X-Files , you want me to think like Scully and Mulder . You got the wrong guy . I need facts , not wild ideas . All right . Then consider this one . I had Pittsburgh PD check the log on that pay phone . 10 : 12pm , a call was placed to one Andre Bormanis . He 's a convicted drug dealer that served time with Tipet . That number 's a DC area code . fbi . Open up ! Mr Bormanis ? Andre Bormanis ? Doctor Bormanis . Agent Doggett . Agent Skinner . Can we have a word with you ? You always up at this hour , Dr Bormanis ? It 's when I dissect my rats . Neighbors can 't hear ' em screaming . That 's ajoke . You spoke to Anthony Tipet earlier this evening . - My machine picked up. I missed the call . - What did he want ? We need to find him , Dr Bormanis . This man may have murdered 23 people . 23 ? The news said 22 . Another man died tonight . I 'm not doing anything illegal here . I just ... I just made him stuff . You mean drugs . You supplied Anthony Tipet with drugs , right ? Hallucinogens were Tipet 's way into the depths of the soul , the heights of consciousness , planes of being that our feeble brain chemistry cannot begin to imagine . Was that why you cut yourself ? Or was that the , uh ... mark of the initiated ? It 's protection . At least I hope it is . Nobody took the trips but Tipet . See , only his mind was strong enough . You know , I can 't tell , Doctor , whether you admire Tipet or you 're afraid of him . Those people he killed last night , did they admire him too ? - What are you doing ? - Taking you in . On what charges ? I just explained it to you . Don 't . Look ... I need that . Don 't ... don 't leave me . Please . Don 't leave me ! Agent Doggett ? It 's Agent Scully . Agent Scully ? Skinner told me about the case . I know you covered for me . You didn 't have to . It 's all right . I appreciate your discretion . It 's easy to be discreet when you don 't know what 's goin ' on . - Are you OK ? - l 'm fine . Skinner says that you 're around the clock on this . You need to get your rest . I grabbed a few winks . I asked him to contact some friends of Mulder 's. I think they 'll be able to help . - l 'd appreciate all the help I can get . - Doggett , you 're a good agent . Trust your instincts . The drug that Bormanis was cooking up was some kind of a superamphetamine . Legal or not , no one 's ever seen it before . You think it was intended for Tipet ? He wants it for himself . He doesn 't wanna go to sleep . - Doggett ? - l wanna talk to him , now . Can we get this gate open ? Get it open now . Agent Doggett , what is it ? Open it up . Byers , we 've a right to information . It 's not our information . - How many times did we save Mulder 's butt ? - How many times did we save Scully 's ? These files are theirs . They 're private . Mulder wouldn 't mind . We practically solved half these cases for him . Yeah , Byers , quit your whining . Scully asked us to give our assistance , not to go through her ... files . - Like she 's gonna care . - Yeah , right . Can I help you gentlemen ? You must be Agent Doggett . I 'm John Byers . These are my associates Melvin Frohike and Richard Langly . You 're the guys Scully told me about . Mulder 's friends . Yes , that 's us . - You publish The Lone Gunman newspaper ? - Our reputation precedes us . Yeah. I read Mulder 's files . Then you know how badly you 'll need our help . We reviewed your case , as Agent Scully asked . Mondo bizzarro . No offense , man , but you 're in way over your head . What help can you give me ? Hit the lights . Are you familiar with this image ? In the Renaissance it represented an all-seeing god . That 's why our Founding Fathers put it on the dollar bill . We believe its meaning here relates to Eastern religion , a belief in the third eye , or what the Hindus call the Sahasrara . The third eye ... We all have a third eye. lf we could open it , we 'd see a new reality - one closer to God . At least that 's what Kesey told me on the bus back in ' 64 . You were not on the bus with Kesey in ' 64 . I got the pictures to prove it . - Before or after you partied at Altamont ? - Altamont was in the ' 70s . - Whatever . - l see where you guys are goin ' with this . - Tipet believes he opened his third eye . - Yes , exactly . The placement of the wounds on his victims could suggest he 's tryin ' to destroy theirs . Yeah ... that could be . But if he 's moved closer to God , why kill ' em ? And how ? We don 't know why . But we might tell you how . - You 've heard of MK-ULTRA ? - The ClA mind-control project in the ' 50s ? They gave LSD to people , to see what would happen . Didn 't bother telling ' ' em first . They understood the power of hallucinogens to harness the mind . Tipet was on hallucinogens , not his victims . The ClA invested millions trying to create psychic assassins , failing where Tipet has succeeded . Reaching a drug-induced higher consciousness , using his mind as a weapon . He makes his victims think they 're being hit by an ax . - Or any number of nightmares . - They believe it , it happens . What if Tipet could invade his victims consciousness in their sleep ? That 's why you 'd be afraid to fall asleep , right ? If you thought your nightmares might come true ? - You believe that ? - No . But if Tipet does ... he 'll need more drugs to keep killin ' . That 's not bad for a beginner . Doggett , someone 's been here . Anthony Tipet . Anthony Tipet . Step away from the saw . You don 't understand . Just step away from the saw . I didn 't want this to happen , but I can 't stop it . He understands . He saw what can happen . What will happen ... unless I stop it . Doggett ! I want a stat trauma panel with full tox , EKG and metabolic profile . Agent , this man needs to be admitted . You need to sign him in . Come in , Agent Doggett . AD Skinner said you could shed light on the reasons for Tipet 's suicide attempt . Yes , sir ... Via negativa - the path of darkness - Tipet believed he reached it . He believed that the drugs took him inside the subconscious minds of anyone he knew , making the most horrific , irrational dream imagery of their nightmares come true . That 's why he tried to kill himself - to make it stop . Excellentjob , gentlemen . Have your reports on my desk 0900 . Case isn 't over yet , sir . AD Skinner says our suspect 's lyin ' hospitalized in a coma . Now you 're sayin ' it 's not over ? We have no murder weapon , no forensic evidence . Unless we accept Tipet 's own beliefs , which you say are preposterous ... lt 's over . - We 've no way of explaining how he killed ... - l said it 's over , Agent Doggett . I don 't need every i dotted or every t crossed to know that we 've got our man . This is Dana Scully . Please leave a message . Agent Scully , I think we caught the guy who did it . But ... still , it ... itjust doesn 't add up . It 's the damnedest thing I ever saw . I know this will sound strange , but there 's a part of me that says what if ... what if this guy was right ? What if I should have let him die ? I 'm not makin ' a whole lot of sense . Maybe I just need some sleep . If you get this message ... and feel up to it , you give me a call . is the assistant director in ? - That 'd be great . Thanks . - John . Excellent work out there , John . Just excellent . Agent Doggett . is something wrong ? I 'm not sure I 'm awake . You think this is a dream ? I mean , you standing here talking to me ? All those people out there ? Last night , I dreamt Tipet was inside my house , holding an ax . I thought I woke up this morning . I thought I was awake , but ... but then ... What do you want me to do , pinch you ? You 're already awake . Stedman and Leeds must have experienced the same thing . All Tipet 's victims . Everything seemed real ... but it was a dream . A dream that ended in their deaths . Anthony Tipet is in a coma , never to regain consciousness . He knows me now . He can enter in my dreams . Listen to me . You 've had a tough couple of days . You 're tired . Go home , get some rest . She 's going to die . I 'm not going to let you do that . I 'm sorry , I 'm not going to kill her . You are . Agent Doggett ? Agent Doggett . Hi . How 'd you get here ? Your door was unlocked . You just saved my life , Agent Scully . I just woke you up , Agent Doggett . Tipet 's in my dreams . - lf you hadn 't woken me up just now ... - Anthony Tipet is dead . I got the call from Skinner on my way over here . He never regained consciousness . - Are you OK ? - l seem to be , yes . If you need some more time off ... I 'm ... I 'm back at work now . That must have been some nightmare you just had . Tipet thought he 'd find God ... by lookin ' in the darkness inside himself . You don 't think he succeeded ? In my dreams , I ... I saw terrible , violent images . Scared the livin ' daylights outta me . These things are a part of me , I can 't deny that . But ... maybe ... maybe they didn 't come from me . Then where 'd they come from ? It was a bad dream , Agent Doggett . But that 's all it was . Visiontext Subtitles : Stephanie Donohue US english

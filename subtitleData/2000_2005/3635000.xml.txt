 pollute and poison our planet . faster than we could clean it up . but we were kidding ourselves . we knew we were in trouble And began to desperately search for a new home " Mars " . we 've been sending unmanned probes with algae bioengineered to grow there and produce oxygen . We 're gonna build ourselves an atmosphere we can breathe . we done it . oxygen levels started to drop . We don 't know why . The international community has thrown all of its resources behind us . It 's the greatest undertaking man has ever attempted . is too massive to launch from the surface of the planet . And we 've shuttled here to the high orbit space station for a lowgravity launch to begin our six month trip The first manned mission to Mars . The hope and survival of mankind rests on us . But I know we 'll solve the problem . Because the best scientific minds are going there to figure out the answer . And I 'm leading the mission . pilot and mission commander . chief science officer and the soul of the crew . but a fine co-pilot . our mechanical systems engineer . Maintenance . not my first choice . The two civilian members of the team are and his own greatest hero . Pettengil . Terraforming expert and lastminute replacement on the science team . AMEE Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion . A multitask robot on loan from the Marines . our Mars surface navigator . We 're the first travelers to another planet . It 's another giant leap for mankind . it could be our last . Alpha Mach indicator . Clear . Confirmed . commander . Lucille . You 're welcome . Gentlemen ! Take over . So can 't believe we 're doing this . Just keep it automatic follow the routine . Secondary systems . OHS / RCS . confirmed . rate 19 . Clear . Confirmed Pettengil ? 000 . That 's great . How many did you get ? 13.6 degrees . 832 . Were they all from your mother ? Yeah . it 's strange . It 's gone . Yesterday I could see it . Today I looked and I couldn 't find it . So what ? You think the Earth just vanished ? It 's gone forever ? so it 's weird . or you won 't . that 's all . Gallagher Up for a couple of turns around the campus ? My grandfather taught me to sail when I was a kid . Taught me to read the stars . he said . Any man who puts his life in the hands of a bunch of batteries is an idiot . A real Yankee . he just wouldn 't approve something he couldn 't build with his hands . He wouldn 't have approved of this . Going to Mars ? He 'd say we were headed for trouble . Say we didn 't try . We just finished poisoning the Earth and everyone was dead in 100 years . Then what was the point of any of it ? all gone . The Greeks . The Constitution . ideas . None of it meant anything ? And what about religion ? Do we give up on God too ? did you ? I realized science couldn 't answer any of the really interesting questions . So I turned to philosophy . Been searching for God ever since . You 're talking to a classroom of second graders from Iowa . At 1430 . Wait a minute . It 's your turn to do the kiddies . and you know it . Besides I outrank you . I could order you to do it . Just because they promote faster in the Navy . Of course they do . You have to when you deal with the best people . with a smile on your face . This mean you 're pulling rank for the shower too ? not rank . Gender . Ladies first . please ? Sure . Sorry . Just pretend I 'm your sister . I have two sisters . They don 't look like you . This only works if we both believe it doesn 't matter . So I should pretend you 're Burchenal . It could matter more than that . Okay ! Why don 't we practice ? You can get back in the shower naked and I 'll pretend it doesn 't matter . Why don 't you go fix something ? sir . Ma 'am . MEV systems check confirmed . I 'll be on the flight deck with Bowman . 000 . 832 . Tighten up . boys . Yeah . God I hate him . It 's like high school . I 'll watch yours . Do you want to help me with AMEE ? Okay . It 's time for her prelaunch diagnostics check . Hang on . Who are you kidding ? You 're a jock . right ? Yeah I was just Tuning cars . Wasn 't really jock stuff . It 's heavy . Ears are still ringing . What is it that powers this thing ? A helium nuclear power cell . runs her for eight months . sweetie . Sweetie ? Is she our navigator or your girlfriend ? Been a long flight . Certainly has . It 's looking good . Let 's check your T1 . Tighten up ! So the military removed her reflexes ? That should make her your kind of girl . Gut him like a fish . Kill him . That 's my kind of girl . That 's real damn funny . Gallagher this activity is strictly prohibited in this area . She could 've hurt me . Cease immediately . but inside she 's all Green Beret . Back in navigator mode . You 'll dig Mars . So have a good time and I hope to see you back on Earth real soon . Good luck . We miss you . Bye . 209 web messages remaining . Teddy . Remember me ? Sure hope you haven 't forgotten your old friends Now that you 're a big hotshot astronaut . Anyway just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you . Commander I sense an irregular humidity mixture . Hi . Hi . How you doing ? Fine . Soon as someone explains to me Why does an indicator on the flight deck saying that the temperature in here is above normal ? About 10 degrees . Fahrenheit or centigrade ? He 's teaching me about biology . I 've developed an interest in Fermentation ? and you 're using the lab equipment as a still ? No . I 'm . I 'm sterilizing . And how do you propose that I explain to Houston that two of my crew went blind drinking moonshine vodka ? Very carefully ? what ? Doesn 't this establishment serve women ? Allow me . Commander Bowman . Wooh ! boys . right ? Lots . And then we killed them . Every last one . since frogs breathe through their skins they react to the toxins in the environment more rapidly . That should 've been a warning . Don 't you think ? What 's your point ? then nothing else matters . That 's not gonna change . Unless there are larger forces at work than biology . I 'm gonna need another pop . Not God Faith . Faith ! I had a girl named Faith . She cheated on me with a girl named Chastity . You wouldn 't be riding 309 million kilometers into outer space and back in a rocket ship that nobody ever tested properly Without having a little faith . okay ? I say Commander Bowman we just take it . We just take it over for ourselves . tell them it sucks and don 't bother coming ? Yeah . Whatever keeps out the riffraff . You can do the religion thing . and Pettengil 's passed out you know . King . What about me ? you 'll be my queen . Propagation of the species . It 's just a . it was a . I suggest we retire . Houston . You have acquired orbit . Congratulations on 182 days of smooth sailing . And welcome to Mars . Houston out . Found a good parking space ? Yep . Right between Phobos and Deimos . you know ? you know what to call it . " The moon . More color commentary from the janitor . The correct term is " mechanical systems engineer . But he will accept " space janitor . " To hell with the chitchat . I 'm ready to get out of this hamster cage . C 'mon what do you say Bowman ? initiate all prelaunch systems checks . commander . Finally . We 'll eat dinner on Mars . Sounds good to me . Mars entry vehicle launch in two hours . HAB 3D model online . It 'll be nice to live on the ground . Even if we are exchanging one hamster cage for another . hydroponics have been online for six months . We 'll have fresh tomatoes tonight . That 's one requirement for my dream house . right ? I wouldn 't mind . commander . Locking in on HAB . LZ 56 . Sure is desolate . Gamma burst . Latch up . Free flow . We 'll lose chips . Shut it down ! some kind of massive solar flare . Radiation alert . Level 5 EMP . guys ! Go ! lieutenant . I 'm not going anywhere . You need me here . I want you back there now ! now ! Go . Massive gamma ray penetration . commander . Power levels are below operating minimums . Shit ! we copy . We 're all okay . What 's the damage to the ship ? We 're dead in the water . Main power unit offline . She 's holding now but could fall apart at any moment . Auxiliary power unit failure . Power level still dropping . Primary systems will shut down in six minutes . boys . We 're launching now . Suit up . I 'll secure the ship . I 'll try to get more systems online and then I 'll join you . suit voice activated . suit voice activated . Power level still dropping . Primary systems will shut down in five minutes . your EVA systems are 100 % . MEVLP lock . Commence MEV systems check . AGF online . Apogee kick motor online . Antiinertial thrusters initialized . Autolaunch program online . I 'm arming it now . Clock delock 9K open . IMU online . DCM flat . AVVI engaged . Launch release system not responding . That 's not good . it isn 't . Let 's try it another way . LRS not responding . Failure to engage . Come on . Launch release system not responding . suit seal 100 % . Air supply 100 % . Ignition systems go . MEV landing system check . I 'm sorry . Launch release system not responding . Listen up . No power to the launch release system . I 'll have to stay back and arm it manually . we 're not leaving without you . It 's not up for debate . Cut autoguidance and try to reboot the arm . we don 't have time . You 're in charge . gentlemen . MEV launch systems ready . Launch on your command . Crew secure ? Secure . Secure . Secure . Secure . The MEV guidance system is scanning for the HAB transponder . MEV launch sequence initiated . We 're green across the board . Boosters online . Fueling D tanks . I hope she makes it . primary system shutdown in 50 seconds . Launch . Autoguidance out . Flare must 've cooked a chip . I thought MEV was shielded . Complain later . I 'm going to manual flight . five seconds . Primary system shutdown . Artificial gravity failure . Shit . We have an electrical fire in access tube four . Smoke warning in sphere six . The solar radiation damaged the auto fire extinguishers . Lucille . commander . I tried warning you . Deploying chutes . Smoke warning in sphere six . Brace yourself this time . we have additional fires in spheres three and five . We 're offtarget . Terrain 's crappy . I 'm dumping the landing gear . AMEE 's in there . No choice . seven and eight . I 'm deploying bags . Biosystems indicate increasing air toxicity . Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown Flames now consume 80 % of the ship . This exceeds our fireextinguishing capacity . All fires are extinguished . O2 levels 0 % . Take him easy . Here . Good . Help him up . sit down for a minute . Nice and easy . There . There . alpha . Compiling mission itinerary . You don 't appear to have any compound fractures . Doesn 't look like you broke anything . Reserve power supplies are failing . 20 % . Lucille . This violates operating parameters . I won 't take no for an answer . You got that ? ! Do it ! Now ! commander . Alpha processor discharged . Power sent to beta chip . Main power unit 15 % . commander . Artificial gravity restored . No shit . Artificial atmosphere systems restored . O2 level 2 % and increasing . Where the hell is HAB ? we 'd know . but maybe I can fix this radio . How long ? Don 't know . These repairs 'll take a while . Science package is IKO 'd also . Pettengil . Really ? Did you miss something ? We lost the science package . We can 't do what we came here for . Quit whining . You did park us on the rocks . And you knew there were risks . locating HAB is what matters . Exterior atmosphere indicator is disabled . I think we 're somewhere downrange . Calculating landing ellipse . Based on our last uncorrupted nav state I 'd say we 're somewhere in this 60 by 120 kilometer ellipse . The mission data 's here . We need to close in on the downrange variables . It 's about the math . This is it . That moment they told us about in high school algebra would save our lives . Shut up . Sorry . AMEE not responding . Mars1 comm initiation unsuccessful . Tray imaging . man . bring up a panoramic shot from the HAB . Ocular mach 1X panoramic mode . Reverse ? Downrange charging . guys . Look at this . Gallagher ? I don 't think it 's about the math . I think it 's about the picture . What picture ? This one . we 'd know where HAB was . but if this rock is HAB and it 's in the line about 30 degrees as it 's on the other side it sees those two peaks . Which puts us on a line about here which makes the line to the HAB about there . He 's right . space janitor . We only have seven and a half hours of air left . Let 's get moving . I realized science couldn 't answer any of the really interesting questions . So I turned to philosophy . Been searching for God ever since . Who knows ? Made by God . Universe is full of surprises . That would be a big one . sir ? I 'm staying here . What ? My spleen 's ruptured . There 's significant internal bleeding . I wouldn 't get very far . We have emergency medical gear at HAB . We can lock out the spine impulse . You can walk us through the surgery . enough to deplete everyone 's oxygen . This is no time for misguided heroics . I won 't let you die here . What we came here to do is more important . The four of you must carry on with the mission . but I know you can do it . Get going . You heard the man . I got to see Mars . give me a red light . Give me juice . don 't do this to me and my team . Give me a goddamn red light . Communications online . See ? All you needed was an attitude check . commander . this is Mars1 . Can you hear me ? Over . this is Mars1 . Do you copy ? Over . Terrascan has nothing to report . No life form trace apparent . It 's weird . There 's nothing here . It 's Mars . I mean there 's not one sign of the algae we sent up here . traces they 're gone . Like they were scoured off . This says there was nothing here. impossible . Maybe there was never anything in this valley . If we are where we think we are this area was covered with blue algae just a month ago . The valley before this should 've been blazing with redorange chloroflectic . All this talking 's burning up oxygen . Move out . We know what happened to the oxygen . Nothing here to make it . You done ? move out . Ten minutes until we exit the day side . where are the boys ? Grid tracking . Delock . where are you ? LZ topography . three minutes tracking . LT lock . MEV landing zone . LZ 56 . Why aren 't you at the LZ ? Five minutes until we exit the day side and lose visuals . 144X . Azimuth HZ 4.99 . where are you ? MEVLP lock . shit . Lucille . There it is ! air and water ! We made it ! Food ! God help us . It 's all chewed up . What happened ? Ice storm couldn 't have done this . No way . Every HAB stood up to an F5 in tornado alley . This isn 't weatherrelated . Okay . What are we going to do ? Start looking for O2 . this is Mars1 . We 've experienced a massive proton field upset sequel to a solar flare . orbital path degraded by firecontrol air purge . Engine function zero . MEV launched with a crew of five . I have visual on crash site . I can see one person down . I have absolutely no radio contact with them . visuals confirm that HAB1 is tangouniform . HAB1 has been destroyed . they have no way to survive . I 'm uploading telemetry and video data to you now . Data unit relay . I don 't see anything . no water . What are we going to do ? Nothing we can do . We 're out of time . We 're out of time when we 're out of air . 16 minutes . What do you got left ? A little less . Some final entry for the bio . not counting the exwives . I hope Bowman made it . I had a thing for her from the start . I thought they chose me because I was single in case I died . Short time to live . Long time to wait . isn 't it ? I was planning on getting engaged when I got back . I 'm going to miss a lot of girls . A lot of girls are going to miss me . I was never supposed to be here . I was just the next lucky guy on the list . my flying ability isn 't an issue now . it makes no difference where we landed . You 're calculating excuses . Nothing to excuse . It 's moot . No impact . But Chantilas ? Moot . He 'd have died here anyway . Just like us . Mr. Santen . and you still can 't accept defeat . I can come across as a hardass . I know that . But technically I didn 't fail . what 's done is done . screw you . I don 't need forgiveness from a pussy like you . Get out of here . Go away and die like a man if you can . my God . Mars ' polar ice is mostly CO2 . We use loworder nuclear detonations to melt the ice . That releases CO2 . CO2 buildup creates a greenhouse effect . Mars starts to warm up . when it 's hot enough we seed down some algae . The algae grows and emits oxygen . You want me to just shut up and let you die quietly ? No . Kind of peaceful . they sent us here to figure out what happened to the oxygen . Question is what happened to the algae ? You know ? Santen 's dead . He threw himself off a cliff . I tried to stop him . replace your O2 canister immediately . I 'm under a minute . What 's it going to be like ? Hypoxia ? Dizziness . Skin will tingle . Vision narrows . convulsions acidosis . Is it going to hurt ? Yeah . I 'm going to . I 'm going to go over here . Take a walk . oxygen supply depleted . Burchenal . Replace your O2 canister immediately . replace your O2 canister immediately . I can breathe . I can breathe . It 's like being in high altitude . but we can breathe . We can breathe ! I don 't know what the hell this is . But I 'll take it . I can breathe . This can 't be possible . What the hell is going on here ? If Santen waited a few more minutes . Santen . We can breathe . incoming relay . this is Houston . We got your message and are glad to hear you . Analysis of your telemetry indicates Mars1 orbital failure in 31 hours . we 'll have you out of there by then . We believe we can restore engine function for a main engine burn and exit from Mars ' orbit . Ground crew is presumed End of Mission . Houston out . Terraforming didn 't even come close to creating breathable air up here . Right ? The oxygen levels were already dropping when all the sensors died . So how can there be more O2 now than ever before and no algae to make it ? commander . No response from ignition systems . Mars1 . No joy on all scenarios for engine ignition . That includes hitting the console . What next ? Over . I wish I didn 't have to wait 40 minutes to hear your answer . guys . Here 's the radio . We 're not going to be calling Bowman on this . Wait a second . I saw something when we were trying to locate HAB . That little rover they sent up here back in ' 97 . right ? Yeah . Hang on . It 's 4 kilometers from here . Going to get dark real soon . It 'll be too cold . We 'll go first light . This thing still has enough rocket fuel to keep us warm . Here comes a billiondollar campfire . At least it 's good for something . If the radio at the rover works we can contact Bowman tell her there 's breathable air here . is it ? Must have been hard watching Santen go like that . it was . I bet . It 's your girlfriend . She made it . AMEE . I thought you were dead . sweetie . Good to see you . You 're kind of banged up . I Knew you 'd make it . are you a little out of whack ? Flip over for me . Shoot . The processor 's damaged . till she breaks down for good . the drone 'll crash . Let 's yank her Mars positioning system now . MPS hard drive 's modular . It 's selfpowered . We can run it through an HHC . That would give us control of the drone that 'd be killing her . Yeah ? You want me to do it ? I 'll do it . Shit ! No . No . what 's going on ? She 's in military mode . Crash must 've flipped her . Why did she turn on us ? We tried to kill her . Made us the enemy . Son of a bitch . You okay ? Then override her . I tried . She won 't respond . It 's a broken rib . Why did she let us live ? She had us . She 's playing war games . Guerilla tactics . It 's an old trick . Wound one of the enemy . The others have to help out . Slows them down . she 'll play search and destroy . Then she 'll come and kill us . One by one . You all right ? AMEE jammed the transmitters so we won 't know where she is . You all right ? Only hurts when I breathe . Sun 's going to come up soon . Might as well get going . Give me a hand ? huh ? AMEE ? Taking the first piss on Mars . Boosters online . AMI confirmed . Ignition system operable . Awaiting burn instructions . green light for engine ignition . I repeat I 'm a go for engine ignition . guys . Thank you for busting your asses . I have some time before I have to punch . I 'll take another look for the crew at daybreak . but it 's something I got to do . Over . Relayed . right ? I always know what I 'm doing . Charming . It 's a 50yearold offtheshelf computer modem on a frequency we 're not using on our mission but it beats shouting for help . I got it . Synchronous lock . L2.3. Seek lock off . 144X . HZ lock . Mars1 . I 'm configuring Mars1 for a final slingshot around the day side . And I will be returning to Earth . Relayed . Let 's do it . test . Does it work ? I don 't know . The little green light 's on . Mars1 . I 've acquired elliptical orbit . I 'm commencing engine ignition sequence for Earth return . This is Mars1 ground crew . Do you copy ? This is Mars1 ground crew . Do you copy ? This is Mars1 ground crew . Do you copy ? Hello ? We 're the guys on Mars . Come on . Someone talk to us . Try again . This is Mars1 ground crew . Do you copy ? This is Mars1 ground crew . Do you copy ? Maybe they 'll hear us back in 1997 . It 's been two hours . Houston . We 've picked something off a radio telescope pointed in your direction . You won 't believe this . You 'll have to tune to a frequency we haven 't used in 50 years . well it was worth a shot . this is Mars1 . Do you copy ? this is Mars1 . Bowman ! Gallagher ? You 're alive . Yeah . you made it too . I know that HAB is wrecked . What is your status ? We 're down here at the little rover with Burchenal and Pettengil . AMEE 's gone mustang we can breathe . How can that be ? The oxygen levels are . That is impossible . I don 't know . But we 're doing it . I saw a body back at MEV . Who was it ? That was Chantilas . Santen 's gone too . What happened ? Pettengil says he threw himself off a cliff . that 's the news . We won 't make it much longer . because we 're fresh out . Let me work on it . I 'll get back to you . I hope she has a magic wand . we have three men alive and breathing on Mars . Let 's bring them home . can you ? I still can 't figure out this algae and oxygen business . don 't you ? maybe . Maybe life 's just more mysterious than you think it is . you spent too much time with Chantilas . But if you want to take the God route that 's up to you . There 's nothing easy about a spiritual life . It 's a lot more difficult than just being intelligent . I think you 're just ignoring the facts . Facts . I bet you were no fun at Christmas . I bet your mom told you there 's no tooth fairy when you were 4 . I 'm a geneticist . I write code . Okay ? P in different combinations . Hacking the human genome . Okay ? I choose where and either your kidneys work or you grow a sixth finger . I do that ! you spot God I 'll trust my Ph. Ds . but it 's the only choice you got . We walk 100 kilometers to a 30yearold Russian rock probe that failed to launch and try to jumpstart it . why couldn 't you make it tough ? name 's Borokovski . Owns a deli in Brooklyn . He thinks you can start the launch sequence right there on site . Former rocket scientist who now specializes in making sandwiches . Terrific . Here 's the hard part You got just under 19 hours to get there and get it off the ground . Then I take back what I said about it being tough . I got to ditch the B tank and use more fuel from A to hold orbit that long . I can 't burn much after that or Mars1 won 't have enough fuel to get home . I need a heading . Which way should I go ? you want to go to your 500 . we 're set . then I 'll be in blackout on the dark side . So I 'll call you when I get back . Roger . Thanks . Sorry it 's not more . it 's something . Give me a hand . It 's nice just to know you 're still up there . I don 't mind dying . I just hate being alone so get your asses back here . Talk to you later . Thanks . My rib feels like it 's through my lung . what do you think ? I think it 's very distracting seeing you get out of the shower . I started to lock the door after that . you didn 't . you didn 't . Good night . What 's that ? Over there . Looks like the ground 's moving . I didn 't see anything . but I definitely saw something . Bowman . How you doing ? Need a headings check . I need to talk to you . Took the comm off . What 's the matter ? The only place to ride the Cosmos is in the rock sample container . Sounds comfy . It 's very small . Borokovski and Houston have been trying to figure out how to cram three people in and it only fits two people . barely . How we doing ? Good . Great . I 'm sorry . right . I 'll talk to you later . Let 's patch you up . It 'll help with the pain . I can barely breathe . This air 's too damn thin ! You 'll be okay . Put your arm over . That 's right . Left foot . Right foot . That 's right . Hop like a bunny . Just go . here it comes Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown What are you doing ? It 's a song my grandfather sang . The Rolling Stones . sing it . Here it comes Here it comes Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown Commander . A massive lowpressure system is approaching the crew . Atmospheric pressure 820 millibars . A big ice storm 's coming straight for you . and it 's moving fast . I 'm going into comm blackout . You need to find shelter immediately . Now . Where can we find shelter around here ? Over here ! There 's an opening ! Maximum sustained winds 111 miles per hour . Temperature negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit . Hurry . Shit ! this is Mars1 . How far is Cosmos from here ? What ? Cosmos . How far you think it is ? Five or six hours . Say five . That leaves us four hours to try and launch not counting whatever time we lose here . This Borokovski better have a good memory . Won 't be time for plan B. Only two of us can go on Cosmos . What ? There 's only room on Cosmos for two people . You two will both go . You carry on with the mission . about what you learned here . and then we 'll say goodbye . after all . it 'll explode . I 'll still live longer than both of you . Gallagher . But somehow I don 't quite believe it . What are you talking about ? He thinks I 'm responsible for Santen 's death . Gallagher ? You trust me ? Do you ? you watch mine ? I know I don 't trust you . But you 're going to leave your buddy here behind and take off with me ? that 's that 's what he 's going to do . this is Houston . but ours is running out of time . Your team 's been out of contact over three hours . They did a great job getting this far but that 's a killer storm no one can survive . So here 's where we are If you haven 't heard from your crew by the time you receive this you 're ordered to return home . Houston out . come in . please ? Shit ! He 's gone . What ? He took the radio . shit . Shit ! It 's AMEE . She wants us to watch . She 's got him . He was afraid we 'd leave him here . He made it come true . We got to get that radio or we 're both dead too . We lost three hours . At least Pettengil 's heading in the right direction . How do you know ? I took a heading before the storm . And lined it up with the stars . We 're okay . Hold on . This is algae . There 's algae here . Why is it here and nowhere else ? No time for that now . There 's Pettengil . At least he didn 't drop the goddamn radio . AMEE really tore him up . Little shit 's got a death grip on it . Give me the radio . I 'll call Bowman . Why 'd he close his visor ? He didn 't have any air left . it 's Gallagher . You up there ? it 's Gallagher . Must still be on the dark side . Jesus ! Some kind of nematode . The sparks ignited them . They 're feeding on the algae . That 's where it went . They 're feeding on the algae . Come on . Son of a bitch . Got it . Thought there wasn 't any life here . I was wrong . there 's life . Think it 's so smart to take those things with us ? remember ? Earth 's losing oxygen . See how those things burned ? and they make O2 . I finally get it . I told you I 'd solve this damn thing . Why are the nematodes here ? Because there 's something left to eat . Hang on . I haven 't seen green fields like this since I was a kid . They 're eating through my suit ! Stay there . You 'll need my air . For the launch . Gallagher . Accomplish the mission . It 's up to you now . Better put your helmet on . I 'm not going out like Pettengil . there is a disturbance on the surface of Mars . God . this is Mars1 . Can you hear me ? Over . this is Mars1 . Do you copy ? Over . what 's going on ? What 's happened ? this is Mars1 . Can you hear me ? Over . I can 't go back . There was some kind of oxygen burn off . It was like a blowtorch . Burchenal 's gone . He sacrificed himself . where are the others ? I 've got to rest . Where are the other guys ? Dead . All dead . I 'm the only one left . Stop and listen to me . It 's over . I don 't know what happened tonight but you have come too far to give up now . You are going to accomplish the mission . I can 't . Burchenal sacrificed himself for you . You want to make that for nothing ? I want you to stand up and I want you to start walking . Gallagher . I can 't . Do it for me . Do it for me . You have to keep going . Okay . commander . Time ? 52 minutes to go . Should be there . You 're almost there . I could have screwed up the celestial nav . you 're there . Could 've run right past it . Shut up and keep moving . I found it . Okay . What do I do now ? Get rid of the sample return tray . Okay . What next ? There 's an infrared maintenance port . It should be marked . Marked . Yeah . In Russian . All right . Got it . Now what ? Connect the radio to Cosmos . I 'll download what you need through the modem . Still works . Go . you should be able to run diagnostics now . All green . This thing has two settings on and off . on " sends it all the way back to Earth . that would be bad . We want power to reach orbit . I 've recalculated for the weight of one . Take two liters out of each fuel tank . There 's a central purge . Russians couldn 't add a gas gauge ? we 're down to 49 minutes so shut up and get to work . Okay . What now ? Launch diagnostics . Avoid pressing anything that says " ignition . Battery 's dead . There 's not enough power to launch . Not enough power to launch . Anything else you can use ? I don 't know . Let me look around . See if I see any alternate highvoltage sources . No . Just rocks . I 'm gonna die on this planet . I 'll stay up here and we will find another way . You can 't stay there without burning more fuel to hold orbit . You got to go . How much time till blackout ? About a minute . Okay . There 's a couple things I got to tell you . There 's life here on Mars . but they ate the algae and they ate HAB too . The important thing is that they make oxygen . Don 't know how but Burchenal said it might be able to save Earth so get some guys up here quick . Just tell them to be safe . They eat everything . commander . that 's about it . I. I really hate this planet . I really miss Earth . I really miss a lot of things . I 'm going to miss you . Aren 't you gonna say anything ? I should have kissed you . you should have kissed me . commander . Goodbye . Here it comes Here it comes Alternate highvoltage energy source . Come and get me . sweetie . sweetie . I 'm going home .

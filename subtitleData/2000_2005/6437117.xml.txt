 Thanks for the beer . Thanks for the lift . So , big plans for the weekend ? Oh , huge . Microwave pizza , satellite TV . Wow . Thanks for making my life sound exciting . Maybe we both need pets . They say people with pets live longer . I was thinking about getting a cat . There 's dog people , and there 's cat people . You are a dog person , John . - How do you figure ? You 're faithful , you 're dependable . You 're without guile . You 're very comfortable to be around . - So why a cat ? - Low maintenance . They don 't expect much from you , so you can 't disappoint ' em . I don 't see you ever disappointing anyone , John . See you Monday ? Yeah . See ya . John , John , John . One , two and three . - Miss ... - Reyes . How you feeling tonight ? You with us ? Hello ? Is anybody here ? Hello . It 's okay . I was a little freaked out too ... at first . - Who are you ? - Stephen Murdoch . L-I don 't even know if that matters anymore ... but my name is Stephen . Did you just look outside ? Yeah . Don 't do that . Where did everybody go ? I think the question is , " Where did we go ? " Were you in an accident ? I think I was hit by a car on my way home . I came in with chest pains . Mr. Barriero , someone new . I found Mr. Barriero wandering around here ... same as you . He fell at a construction site where he used to work . You think we 're dead . No . No , I don 't believe that . Have you ever been dead ? So how do you know you 're not ? Hell of a thing to wake up to , huh ? We stopped after work . She had a beer . Well , the man who hit her had 15 . Don 't do this to yourself , John . It 's true , John . She 's gone . I don 't accept that . They 've got her breathing . Her heart 's still beating . There 's got to be hope . There 's no measurable electrical activity in her brain . Brain death is ... indeed death , John . I 'm sorry . The thing is , it 's not that bad , once you get used to the idea . Have you seen this ? It 's nonsense , all of it . There 's not a single sign on any of the walls here . Why is that ? You say we 're dead . This seem like heaven to you ? A big , deserted Catholic hospital ? I didn 't say this was heaven . For all I know , it 's ... it 's hell . I don 't know anything for sure . Maybe this place is a way station , ; a stop on the road to what comes next . Where are you going ? I 'm finding a way out . Jack Preijers . I 'm very sorry for your loss . Look , you two are the experts ... but there 's got to be something more that can be done . Well , I wish there were . And I don 't mean to make this any harder ... but I do have information you both need to hear . Your partner had a living will . She signed an organ donor card . Uh-uh . No way . - John ... - Just slow down , all right ? She 's lying there in one piece . There 's no fractures , no damage to her skull . Does that add up to you ? John , at the end of the day , it doesn 't matter . It doesn 't change the diagnosis or her prognosis . In these situations , time is always of the essence . There is a woman in Minnesota who can be saved by your friend 's heart . In a real sense , she will live on . Mr. Murdoch ? Mr. Barriero ? You , stop ! Monica ? Monica ! What 's happening to him ? Oh , my God . I am so very sorry for your loss . They 're burning up the phone lines down there . Arranging with all these other hospitals how to divvy up Monica . They say they could do it as early as tomorrow . Is there anything , anything at all ? I did note some minor swelling in the left anterior ... which is consistent with subdural hematoma . Minor swelling ? L-I don 't know if that means anything . It 's not like there 's an exact formula ... for how much damage equals death . What about this ? This was monitoring her brain activity , right ? - Electrical impulses . - Yeah . She had EEG monitoring after the point that she coded . Suddenly they just stop here . Right here . And if we can learn what this is , maybe we can reverse it . Agent Doggett . Okay , so-so this woman you saw ... she went through the wall ? I don 't know . She was here , and then she disappeared . Disappeared ? What do you mean , like Mr. Barriero did ? Different than Barriero . Okay , okay , let 's concentrate ... on one unexplainable event at a time here . What the hell happened to Mr. Barriero ? My opinion ? I think he died . You can 't die if you 're already dead . Which backs up my belief that you and I are alive . I have no idea where she went . Hold on . Lfhe 's dead ... and we 're not ... then where the hell are we ? - Dr. Preijers . - I 'll be there in one minute . I 'm wondering about this moment on my partner 's EEG tape ... 8 : 11 p.m. , when brain death apparently occurred . - You 're reviewing our records ? - Well , no offense , but yeah . I just need to know if there 's some change in Monica 's condition leading up to this . Agent Doggett , if you 're trying to build a malpractice case against me or this hospital ... I 'm not . I just want the facts . Whitney , could you pull the code notes from earlier tonight ? Mm-hmm . Look , Monica had a seat belt and an air bag protecting her through the crash . The ambulance crew said she was conscious at the scene . I just think there 's something we 're all missing . Well , I don 't think this will help you any ... but this describes what my team and I did to save your friend . You can take it , copy it , study it at your leisure . Dr. Preijers ? Oh , it 's all right . You work here ? Uh , I-I 'm a patient aide . I deliver the flowers mostly . Are you her husband ? You love her , though . She 's not gone . Not her soul . I wish I could talk to her . I wish I could tell her . Guess I wish a lot of things . Come on . You 're not giving up , are you ? Monica . Please . Don 't run . Who are you ? I 'm Audrey . L-I work at the hospital . Audrey , I 'm Monica . Stephen and I just want to get out of here . Will you show us the way out ? I can 't . I can 't help you . Why not ? I came to tell you your friend ... loves you very much . My friend ? Did you talk toJohn ? Does he know where I am ? They all think you 're dead . Wait ! Give my friend a message . Tell him he 's a dog person . - Hey , Whitney . - Doctor , it 's not my place to say ... but you might want to review the code notes for tonight . - Why is that ? - Well , there was an injection you gave Miss Reyes ... that wasn 't in the notes . I don 't think so . In trauma bay . I saw you administer an I.V. Push . I assume it was epinephrine . I have no memory of that . - Anybody else see that ? - Just me . But it happened . My only point being ... if there is an investigation , that 's the kind of inconsistency ... malpractice lawyers love to get ahold of . Whitney , thank you so much for looking out for me . There 's cat people , and there 's dog people . You are a dog person , John . You 're faithful ... you 're dependable . You 're without guile . And you 're very comfortable to be around . I don 't see you ever disappointing anyone , John . Get me some help in here ! What exactly are you thinking ? She helped work on Monica . I started asking questions about what happened in the trauma bay ... and she very inconveniently drops dead . You 're thinking that somebody murdered her to cover something up . Well , if it were you , how would you go about it , make it look like natural causes ? Well , I 'd use a fast-acting barbiturate like pentobarbital . I 'd use a small-bore needle to make it next to impossible to find an injection mark . Next to impossible . That 's why you 're perfect for the job . Should probably test her blood too while you 're at it , right ? Agent Doggett ... I 'm happy to do this for you . Just don 't kid yourself that this is going to somehow bring her back . Your name is John , right ? She has a message for you . She says you 're a dog person . Wait . Where did you get that ? Who said that to you ? I told you . She 's not gone . Look , I went through every last page of that before you ever got here . It 's just nonsense , just like you said . There 's not a clue in it . Maybe in itself it 's a clue . This place looks pretty complete at first glance , but really it 's not . There 's so much missing . Words , details . It 's like a set . A movie set . But like it was built by someone who couldn 't quite grasp ... what it was they were recreating . Stephen , you okay ? Stephen , talk to me . What 's ... What 's happening to me ? Does he feel any pain ? Absolutely none . It 's just a matter of time now . You live down here ? The-The nuns let me stay . L-I wanted to be a nurse , only I can 't do much ... but they let me help out . This is this hospital . You made this ? Why ? L-I like to visit it . I sort of go ... inside my head . You go into the model ? I like it there . It 's quiet . I used to have it all to myself ... but then some people showed up . Hospital patients . Your friend . This is where you say you talked to her ? Right inside here ? Well ... not so much like tiny people in a ... in a model ... but ... inside my head ? Up here , I guess . You don 't believe me . Audrey . You said that you saw some other people besides my friend . Other patients ? Can you tell me who they are ? There 's so much ... I 'd do ... differently . What ? Life . I 'll call you back . Monica 's parents are on their way from Mexico City . They 're coming to say good-bye . They can say " hello " instead . Nobody 's shutting off her life support system . - Not with what I got . - What are these ? Patient files . Both men were declared brain dead , same as her . All three have something else in common too . Check out the attending physician . - Dr. Jack Preijers . - Yeah , he 's some kind of Dr. Death . He gets off on pulling the plug on his own patients . He did it last night to this guy Barriero . Well , at the request of the family . But what I 'm saying is what if he poisoned Barriero in the first place . Same as this guy Steven Murdoch , same as Monica . The tox screen will prove it . How did you come up with these two men 's names ? If I tell you that , you 'll think I 'm crazy . But Monica 's alive , same as this guy Murdoch . And we got to help them both get back . Steven , stay with me . - Audrey , it 's John Doggett . - Audrey . ! I still need your help . I told you their names . Mr. Barriero and Mr. Murdoch . No , they 're both dead now . Monica 's the only one left . And inside an hour , the hospital plans to cut off her life support . Now , I 'm not going to let that happen ... no matter what it takes . But I 'm losing here . Nobody else believes she 's alive . Nobody ... just you and me . I can 't do anything . I only deliver the flowers is all I do . I can 't help . You can talk to her , right ? You can . Audrey , I need you to talk to her . I need you to tell her what 's going on . I need you to tell her that they 're going to pull the plug . I need her to ... I need you to tell her to fight . I need you to tell her to show us some sign ... anything ... that she 's in there . I need her to understand . I don 't know what the hell else to do . Monica ? John wanted me to tell you something . You gave him my message ? He says you don 't have very long . He says you have to give them some kind of sign . I know , I-I 'm sorry . Are you really going to leave me here to die ? Uh ... I can 't ... do ... anything . There 's ... There 's something wrong ... you know , up here . And I can 't help anyone . It 's ... I deliver the flowers . It 's all I do . And I have to even get help with that ... because I-I can 't read what 's on the little cards . You can 't read ? I see it all jumbled up . This is your hospital . It 's you who created it . It 's all you , Audrey . This place is all you . And that means you can make the rules work ... any damn way that you want them to . You can help me escape . Audrey ? You know , I 've always wondered what was down here . I 'm being accused of things , Audrey . Terrible things regarding three patients of mine . Really , it 's ... it 's beyond the pale . You 're not going to yell out , are you , Audrey ? Audrey ? Audrey ? Audrey ! Audrey , what 's happening ? You have to go . This way . No . If I do that , I 'll burn up . I 'll die . No . Not now . But you have to hurry . What about you ? I know now . I know who told me to build it . The transplant teams are in place . They 're not cutting her up . John ... I 'm still waiting for your argument . If you have something to convince me ... to convince the doctors that somehow she 's alive . John . Audrey . Where you going , Doctor ? Oh , God . Oh , no . Good night . Good night .

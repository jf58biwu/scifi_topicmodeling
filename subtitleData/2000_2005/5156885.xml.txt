So you gonna come see us awfull great pain in the ass . No , I have things to do . I talk to you , when you get back . That was short . It is just the way he is . Everyday about this time he was of by himself . What ? Nobody knows . Nobody knows where either . Well , it is gonna be somewhere inside the compound . Yes , but there are parts of the mountain have been isolated from the rest . Presumably for safety reasons . Nobody is allowed in there . Except Marcus . Except Marcus . That 's funny . I thought you guys building a world war secrets when it necessary anymore . You have been in the darkness , I know you are there . Is that a terrific metaphorm , or what ?

But if I were taked out , why don 't you bring me to the Death . Our relation ships doesn 't have fall ups and downs . Dear dad !

Slight wind out from South . Ah , wind . It 's been about 15 years , since I felt the wind on my face what I guess , Or the sun or walk to more , than 12 feet in any direction . You 'll see it again Megan . I promise . Marcus , Their eye checks you sell CAD cash . I have to tie up , that being death incarnate is a real bitch somedays . The benefits are lousy , the pay stinks , But I get to make my own ours ... and I have you . Not to bad a bargain , all things considered . Ahh , you really went in to town with this splint , Kurdy ? I think it is broken . We gotta get back up . It is rover man . See you kind a condition into . Kurdy ! Hey , Kurdy ! Ahhh , men . It is all right ! You 'll be fine .

We 'll finish this later . Wait a minute ! Wait ! I remember you ! You standed in the road up there . I 'd sweardly miss you ! Wich was copletly unnecessary . After all , I 'm invulnerable . You couldn 't hurt me . Strike me down , and I shall rise again . Anyway , I was just try to warm you about the bandits wathing the road , about a quarter mile down . They look for unwary travellers . And then , they drive them of the road , after injuring them in the process . Excuse me . Then will be terrible , or something like that had happend . - Vincent , hi . - Erin , sorry I didn 't see you . It 's al right . Just want to see how the thing are going . Fine . Good . And , Marcus is getting everything he needs ? Marcus ? Yes , the ... you know , stuff you bring him . Yeah , nobody suppose to know about that . You are right . Absolutely nobody . Of course , as his right hand , I know all about that . That is to say I should know , that everything goes on the right here , because , if I didn 't know everything about all around here , I wouldn 't be a very good right hand , would I ? And since I 'm a very good right hand , I would have to know about this , wouldn 't I ? Yeah , I guess so . I ... So , is he getting everything he needs ? I suppose so . Well , he is gonna run out of plastic forks pretty soon , but ... Plastic forks . Yeah , is he every day bring him a plate of food from the kitchen , with one plastic fork , one plastic knife . Now , the plastic knifes we have plenty of , they stuffed this place pretty good . But , we have a problem with the forks . She see some animals got into the store room , and ... a long story . Anyway , we need to find some forks pretty soon , because he never seems to bring his back , after he has lunch . That is what he is doing right now , haveing lunch ? I figured that , he just likes to get away from every one . Have some qiuet time . You know ? Of course , what else could it be ? Thanks Vincent . Not a problem , Erin . How is he doin ' ? Well , his arm has broken , as for sure . The rest , I don 't know . Could be a marking conclusion , it could be much worse . Ah , there is a place I can take him , where they get fix him up , I just , gotta get back to my truck . To see how banged up it is . Listen , can I leave him here with you , while I go ? I just need to have look at it , and see what 's gonna take to get it fixed . Yes . It is not a problem . Actually , it is a problem , and I apologise , for bring into you a very kindfull helping . Well , our Death touch on , we have to look after each other . You don 't help people when they needed , no one 's gonna help you , when it 's your turn . It is just when someone must have take it to a whole new level . I save them from the bandits . Captain Iron saves the day again . Is that ... Yeah , thats John . Shelly knows the inportants of maintaining my secret identity , but I think I can trust you . You are my kind of person . Uhm , why is he ... ? It 's a long story . No , it 's not . He is a nut . That 's it . Short into the point . Damned , Micheal ! Look , I , I hate interrupt really , but i gotta get back to my truck . Do you think maybe , one of you can take me ? I 'll do it ! Captain Iron stands ready to assist you , citizen . Uhm , he does know the way . Ah you see ? smiling . Thing are getting better already . Ah , it 's just funny . What is ? When I was a kid , I was a big fan of Captain Iron . Watch all those cartoons , play the video games , and collected every counted book . Ah , my early work . But , listen , why do you do all of this , what 's the ... ? My supersonic hearing , has detected something . This way ! Bandits ! harriering man . Raiders . Yes , all of us . Yeah , they too . he 's try to warn you about . We 've never come this before self before . We should go . Yeah . We 've had to rejust our power elecation 5 % increase , in population through burst intuition since to half . I 've talke to somebody of the members of the consul , and we like to hear any suggestion , you might have , how to conserve energy . There is some damaged solar panels , on the other side of the mountain , we can try to fix them . We could also turn off power to the arreas , had been closed off for security reasons . After all , no one 's using it . Why waste the energy ? No one 's using it , what energy is been wasted ? Well , then there must be some automatic system still operation in there , because , I checked the resources department , and they confirm , that there is a fairly size of powerdrink in there . So , something has turned on . It is probably the back up air flewtration system , the problem is , they 're all interconnected . We turned them off , we risked loosing the main system . We 'll find some other way . Ofcourse . Marcus ! Do you trust me ? With my life . Hey man ! How you doin ' ? See this ? This the only part of my body , that doesn 't hurt . How is the Rover ? Ya , that is bad than it might be . Gonna need some parts the wagon , I 'm not sure we gonna get them . Sorry , I could use the rest . There is dinner in the pad outside . It is not much , especially you are guests , but , I 've got my cooking from anything else we can use . Hum , than I just go patroll the area around still there . Listen , how did he get like this ? John was alvays addle . Even for the Big D. His is bright , great with computers , but real quiet , you know , come home from school , and go straight up to his room made his comics . Watch tv , plays computer games , little home land , you know , God It is hard to remember all those things we had . Everywhere , like the air , and than one day they were still gone . He loved superheroes . He learnd as more else from superheroes , since to right-wrong , and his believe , that never something really bad happends . Heroes appear . We lost our parents . Everyone in the god them planet lost their parents . I 'm just couldn 't handle it . He wouldn 't let to anyone to move the bodies , or burn them and take them to the houses of the dead . We sure , this was all the same terrible mistake . Not the parents were really dead , because no one dies forever in comics . We figured if we waited long enough , eventually , a hero would show up to fix everithing , make the world what it use to be . Somebody , who could bring our parents back . And make everithing okay again . But nobody showed up . Than one day he was like something just snapped . And John was gone . There was only Captain Iron . The only way for John to avoid facing the truth . It was for a hero to appear . So a hero had to appear , even if he was him . Whatever is left to him , it is still inside there . You wanna see something , nobody ever seen before ? I can help you find the parts you need . At the Iron cave . At what ? Say nothing . Just follow me . Pretend like you don 't know anything . But I don 't know anything . That 's good . But not now . Wait ' till someone asks . Come on ! I don 't know what to do about this , Megan . Somehow gonna have to find somewhere to move you . That 's not possible . I know Erin . She 's not gonna let this go untill she checks up this whole arrea . There are some old environment suits in the storage room , I can put you in one of them , and move you in one of the clean rooms . * They apart fraze there was old enviroments suits . If there is even one small terrain , they have even been warned through . Megan , listen to me ! They put me in this room for a reason . I 'm the next best thing to tipe for marry in the past hundred years ! I 've got the virus responsible for the Big Death , and even no it didn 't kill me I 'm still a carrier . Those bacteria are alive in my blood stream right now . Do you really want to risk exposing this place , the whole world ? No , of course not . You think you can fix everything ? You think you can help everyone ? That 's why I love you . But there is nothing you can do this time . I swore , I never let anything happend to you , Megan . I don 't break my promisses . I know . I had to turn on the noble ? * lights . It takes a well . Holly shit ! You are the first person , I 've ever allowed in here . What do you think ? Well , it 's ... really , incredibly ... it 's you . This is where I keep my disceises , You know , because sometimes Captain Iron has to go under cover . Ropes for climbing , grappling hooks , gas mask , Utility belt . I don 't know how they got there . This is my armory . I keep them here , because it 's cool . Your health last longer . And this , this is where I make , my daily valor . Would you like to hear it ? Ahh , well I can ... I am Captain Iron ! And I will use my powers only for god , never for evil . I will fight in justice , wherever I find it . I will help those , who can not help themselves . I 'm a spirit of justice , and I am a spirit of vengeance . And I will kick the ass of the unrightous . I will be gentle , for the world is hard . And I will be careing , for the world is hash . And I will be strong , and I will injure pain . And I will die bravely , and I will make it all better again . For that the children will never have to look up in pain . No one knew why they lost so much , why so many had to die . Why they still even alive . Because , because no one should ever have to ask that question . Be a man . This is why I wanted you to come . Ah , you remember theese , you turn a handle , you power a little generator , and than , zammo , let their be light . Well I found the way , to divert the power , to recharge this . It is probably the only working lap-top for 5 hundred miles in any direction . But I gotta go in . I 'm good with computers , you know . Yeah , I heard . But this ... It 's a data base . For every resource in the area . A superhero needs to know , where to go for what he needs , right ? Of course . So I spent an entire year , go into every abadoned bilding , in a 10 mile radiusz . I inventoried everythig , I found . Here . ah , Manny 's Diner . See , 427 spoons , 422 forks , you counted every spoon ? This 422 sound like a roundly dat ? Just type what you need into the search engine , if it 's anywhere in this area , it will show up here . I 'll just watch , you know , make sure , you don 't touch the wrong button . Mike ! Hey ! Mike ! Mike ! Nooo ! Mike ! And the last thing is a radiator hose for the rover , then the exit reload over . Hardware store at Spang street . That 's it . Wow , this is great . All we gonna do is collect this stuff , we are on the way in a couple hours . It take a sec . Hell of a data base you got here . I 'm gonna try something else . What 's that ? It 's place my dad mentioned . Somewhere he was going , and try to find it . Called Valhalla sector . No ! Delete , delete , delete ! Never tell ! Never say the word ! Never say the word ! What do you know about the Valhalla sector ? No ! What do you know about the Valhalla sector ? No ! Don 't ! Please don 't say the word ! Please ! Don 't ! Don 't ! Please ! Listen ! It 's important ! No ! You sit in the dark . Because , you kept me there . I saw her Marcus . I don 't know who she is , but I know what she is ! Erin ! She is a threat to every single person living here ! She is a threat to the whole damm word ! What is she doing here ? You lied to me ! You said you trusted me ! You said you trusted me with your life ! My life , yes not her 's . How did she get here ? Is anyone else of the consul know about her ? No . No one . I was ... She was brought here in the last days of the Big Death . We discovered that , she have a disease transmitted . It didn 't kill her . She was always suppose to be here temporarly . We gonna transfer her to central for disease controll net land tab . But the pilots got sick and died . Then , the scientist got sick and died . Then one more she woke up , and she was alone . And locked in . Every adult in a hundred mile was dead . Including my parents . I was just wandering from what to do , how to survive , when I found her . She was there for days without food and water , unable to get out , because the air type doors only open from the other side . Then I sighted something . She was gonna die in there . Help me ! Please ! I 've been taking care of her ever sence . Did it ever accure to you , that maybe , she was suppose to die in there Marcus ? Maybe , that 's why they setted up that way . So that they 've died , she couldn 't get out to infect or reinfect the world . Is it farely that , one person die , to save ten ? Ten ? No . The world ? Your damm right ! I have to tell the rest of the consul , about this . Erin ! I can 't keep this secret Marcus ! It 's , It 's too big . They have a right to know , she is here . To know , what kind of danger they 're in . They will panic . They could ... They could decide to kill her . You don 't know that . Maybe , they could figure out a solution you missed . Either way , they have a right to know . Please , don 't do this . You always said , I had to do , what I thought was right . So tomorrow , at the consul meeting , I will telling them . I 'm sorry Marcus . Shelly ! Shelly ! Wait ! I tried to stop them , I tried to fight them , but it was too many of them . Holly hell ! Theese son of a bitch ran in here , doin the whole thing . I did the best I could , but I wasn 't do so much . We have to get her back ! There is no telling , what they could be doing to her . There are six of them ! Armed ! Alright ? We go up there , we don 't stand a chance . They will kill us all . - She is your wife ! - And she is your sister ! And I don 't see , how could you stop them , hero boy . They are , they are just too many of them ! And you show me someone , who wouldn 't run . Hey , where you goin ' ? To get her back . You can stay if you want . Nobody said anything , about staying . I 'm going with you . No , Kurdy you did everything you could , alright ? Just stay here , incase , we gonna fall back . We gonna need you for reinforcements . If you see us comming through here running , that means troubles right behind . We should go by the Iron cave . Pick up suplies . We man all be time . * Move out man , come on ! I been for guised you first with you . I hope you prusiaded . Fuck you ! Don 't worry citizen ! You 're safe now . Come on ! Guys , come on ! No ! Let 's go ! Go ! Hey , guys come on , get you stuff let 's go ! John ! I told you , I told you , I was a hero . I made it better . I saved you , didn 't I ? Yes , yes you did . Why 're you crying ? I am , invulnerable , you know . yeah . Nothing can hurt me . Strike me down , and I shall rise again ! Johny ! Mom and dad are gone , are they ? Yes , they are . I miss them so much . Is , is it okay now , I miss them ? Yes , it is . I love you Shelly . I love you . We should get going . Those guys gonna come looking for us . Don 't want what happend to you , to him , to happend us . Where the hell were you , when all of this ? Shelly ? I thought , you were gone . And there was nothing , what we could do . You didn 't think it was possible ? Because , you don 't think anything is possible . Maybe , John was crazy , but atleast he had hope . He was a willing to try , and he kept him from turning is back on me like you did . If would my person in there , maybe this would not happend , maybe John would still be alive . Crap ! Go on ! Get ! You shouldn 't be here ! Be gets one anyway . Where did you guys come from ? We live in a camp , over the hill . That way . Captain Iron use to come by sometimes , and tell us stories . He told us about how you beat professor maybe with some health infiny . Infinity machine . * How to tell the right thing , from the wrong thing . How is she never give up . He told , he can die either . Remember ? He was lying . It was all just a big all fat lie . It is what my dad says . There is no such things as heroes . Bad guys always win . Can you get these guys into next town ? Yeah . Where you going ? Meet me back here tomorrow morning . I 've got an unfinished business . Hello ? I 've got a pretty good at feeling , when there is someone in the other room . So you please , turn the lights on . You must be Erin . Marcus tell me about you . I am Megan . I know . I shouldn 't be here . Than why did you come ? Was it to look at the monster face to face ? To convince your selve , that telling the others about me , is the right thing to do ? yeah . Marcus tell me that aswell . So , you gonna try to talk me out of it ? No . To tell you , the gods always true with be a relief . So , go ahead . Ask me the question you came here to ask . What question ? Why am I still here . I should have died with the old world . So why am I still alive ? It 's true , what Marcus said . The virus is still alive inside you . Still alive , still lethal . I walk out that door , and I could wait by have the world all over again . Or I could save it . How do you figure ? Marcus thinks , the virus will come again . The only chance we have to beat the virus by understanding it . By creating a vaccine . But the virus can only be properly studied well , when it 's still alive inside the host body . That 's where I come in . I 'm a live sample , Erin . This is my personal predestination . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . It 's funny , really . I can save the whole damm human race . All I have to do is stay alive long enough to be die sected by someone , who knows what they doing . My death could be the only thing I 've done with my life , that matters . I 'll hold on to that , Erin . Because , sometimes it 's the only thing standing between me and madness . And , Marcus . You love him . Don 't you ? Yeah . Yeah I do . I love him , even if he was the only man , who walked through that door in 15 years . There are times I think , you know , I just can 't take it anymore . You worried about me being here . Push that button . Hold it down for 10 seconds . Turn the switch . And walk away . It will slowly draw the air out of the room . It will get stuffy . And I will go to sleep . It will be all ower . Problem solved . And I wont have to worry about it , because it wasn 't my decision . Go on . I won 't hold it against you . Are you happy ? Are you satisfied now ? I mean slave works , isn 't it ? You set this up . You take someone like him , you gave him hope , just , so you can take it away again ? What he ever do to you ? What did any of his ... ever do to you ? What did the whole fucking world do to you ? To we deserve all of this . I mean , come on , locus and the death of the first born , wasn 't good enough for you anymore ? So , now it 's a death of the eldest ? Death to heroes ? You know what ? Fuck you ! Because , we just not gonna lay down , and die down here . You wanna finish of the job ? Come down here ! Do it your selve ! You send the angel of death , but you better give one hell of a big sarcasm , I tell you what , we are gonna kick his ass . All the way back . To the great white fucking throw on . And we 're coming for you ! We coming for you . Erin ! Before I go in there , I want you know one thing . High boy is trusted you . I taught you have thing for your selve . * It will be wrong from me to try to change your mind right now . So , whatever you decide , just ... The airflewtration system is down ten percent . Excuse me ? I 'm concerned , the airflewtration system is not working as well as it should be . At the bord of the mountain , we need all the air we can get . It 's number one on my list to * for the consul . And number two ? Nothing important . Nothing , you need to worry about . You are a good friend , Erin . Than , you respote the favor . * Never forget that again . Don 't hold back from me . Even if I think you wrong , I 'll allways back you up . Allways . Come on pass it over ! I 'll take that back . He is up there ! come on ! Come on ! Over there ! Go ! go ! Move ! I am Captain Iron ! I will fight in justice , where ever I may find it ! I will help those , who can not help themselves . I 'm a spirit of vengeance , and I am a spirit of justice . And I will kick the ass of the unrightous . So who 's next ? Do you get done , what you needed to get done ? Yeah . And you ? Yeah . I 've got them to the next town about twelve miles from here . They 'll be fine ' till the safety come back . They can come back when ever they want . Problem 's fixed . I don 't need to know , how you do it . You don 't need . Before I took off , Shelly told me to give you this . Strike me down and I shall rise again ! Come on . Let 's go . He was right here , do you remember ? Who ? He asked me if one guy could make a difference , Yeah , so ? Next time we have to be more carefull about the kind of question you ask . You really think , that there is have aswered ? It will do for now . Fordította : Karesw Javította : Galadriel

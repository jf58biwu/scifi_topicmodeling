 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . The legendary parade-float graveyard . Well , at last , we finally saw it . You remember when Mom used to wake us up at 5 : 30 in the morning ... to come down and get good seats for this parade ? Yeah . With her beer cooler full of egg-salad sandwiches ... and boy are they tasty . Industrial-strength sunscreen . - Man , I love a parade . - That makes one of us . Did you know , to use your vernacular ... this here place is plum creeping me out ? - Hey . - Yeah ? - Looks like some kind of medical lab . - Maybe . This is identical to the shit they had in L.D.U. 7 . What , do they all got the same interior decorator or what ? Oh , shit , Dad . What do we got here ? Pyjamas . Damn . Look at that rash on his ... Look at his face . What is it smallpox or something ? - Don 't touch it . - I don 't intend to . His eyes aren 't blinking . He 's alive , but ain 't nobody home . What the hell is he looking at ? What the hell is so fascinating ? Give me a hand . Let 's pull him out of here . - Careful . Don 't touch his skin . - I 'm not gonna do it . Let me do it . Damn it ! Damn it ! Damn it ! Christ ! Christ ! What the fuck ? A vampire ? Holy fuck . Shit . - Hey , you all right ? - It 's like teeth went through my skin . Shit . - Are you really surprised ? - Yeah , right . Century Innovations bought the warehouse ... for remodelling and it looks like ... they put one of their secret rooms in there . They 're under major scrutiny ... since L.D.U. 7 suffered structural inadequacies . What a crock . I 'm betting all their new projects are tabled , until the heat 's off them anyway . Well , I 'll tell you one thing . They got out of that warehouse in a hurry . - Hey . - Hello , there . How are you all ... Oh , this PlayStation , it 's for me ? No , Daddy . It 's not for you . It 's for Corey . - He 's always wanted it , so ... - Early Christmas ? That 's my kind of parent . - Usual poison ? - Just a glass of water , please . - How 's your hand ? - Well , I think it 's infected ... but that 's okay ' cause it 'll get me out of your mother 's wallpaper project . - Don 't count on it . - A woman in house-renovation mode . - Isn 't that Dante 's seventh circle of Hell ? - No , that 's a woman on a diet . No . That 's when you forget your girlfriend 's birthday . No . It 's when you denigrate her entire gender . Well , in all deference to the feminist gaff , just to get us back on track , this ... Just to get us back on track , this L.D.U. 7 lab looks exactly like ... the remnants of what we found in that warehouse of the parade shit . - So where 's that leave us ? - This guy that attacked us ... he had this cross-hatching on his skin . Kind of looked liked electronic circuitry . - So we can assume he 's a Synthetic ? - I don 't know about that . We didn 't find wires , white soup . It was just a rash . Well , how can you be sure he wasn 't a Synth ? Because when I pasted his face against the wall he bled like a prizefighter . I mean , it was weird . This guy looked like he was half dead ... and all of a sudden he comes alive , he 's meaner than a boar hog . - Here you go . - Can you bring me another one , too ? Thank you . You 're awfully thirsty . Yeah . I think it 's these antibiotics . I mean , check this out . - Possible side effects , embolism , stroke ... - Anal leakage . Try alternative medicine . You might survive . I 'll give it a whirl . So once again we find ourselves in familiar territory . Completely clueless . We have no idea as to the purpose of this lab ... and we have no idea as to what the big picture is . That 's right . And , once again , we can 't find our ass with both hands ... but I will tell you this . Personally speaking , I 'm getting a little pissed off playing catch-up ball here . I don 't know about you all , but I wanna go on the offensive . - Same here . - It 's about time . Good . Hey , Corey , Paul , I 'm home . Sorry I 'm late . Hey , Corey , I got a surprise for you . Where are you ? Hey , Paul ? Corey ? Where are you ? Oh , my God . Oh , God . Oh , my God . 9-1-1 . What is the nature of your emergency ? I think my son has been kidnapped . All his stuff is gone out of his room . I think my son is ... Oh , my God . Ma 'am ? Ma 'am , I need to get some information from you . " I 'm taking Corey away to keep him safe from you . " Excuse me , ma 'am , are you there ? I 'm sorry . I made a mistake . He hasn 't been kidnapped . I 'm sorry . Chuck ? - Chuck . - What ? - You are ice cold . - Bring me some water . - I 'm getting a thermometer . - Bring me some water . - How 's it look ? - Shit . What ? Careful . Well , that can 't be right . - What ? - 93 degrees , that 's hypothermia . It 's probably broken . - Bring me some more water , please . - Hot tea . Whatever . - Take this . - Yeah . - She gone ? - Yeah . Look at this . Nothing . - That 's impossible . - Yeah . I know . Astronaut training is tough . Just being here is an accomplishment . Plus you 've got the added burden of being Chuck Taggart 's son . - We all know what big shoes he wears . - Yeah . So we 've got this situation , and we need to address it . Have you considered just opting out of the programme voluntarily ? My parents , they have no idea that ... - That you 're failing your exams . - Yeah . I 'd be more than happy to speak to your father . - No . No , I will handle it . Okay ? - Good . That 's very wise . - ' Cause it 's all in your hands . - What do you mean ? There 's been some concern about your father 's last mission , the whole ... Bright Sky snafu . You can insure your value at NASA ... by making a contribution that only you can . I don 't understand . I am guessing you see your father every day ? Just keep your eyes open ... and if you see anything out of the ordinary , let me know . - You want me to spy on my dad ? - Well , that 's a pejorative spin . I would advise you that you weigh your options very carefully . What is going on ? I 'm sorry . Did I wake you all up ? You were right . This whole room really needs redoing . - But it 's the middle of the night . - Not tired . - You did this with your bare hands ? - Yeah . It 's old , it came off easy . You know . Eight by five by two is 80 . Eight by eight by two is 128 . 128 plus 80 is 208 . Say , one gallon of paint for 400 square feet . One gallon ought to cover it all . Buy a brush , pick your colour , get it on . - Do you feel all right ? - Never better . Dad , maybe you should check your calculations . No , I think they 're right . Eight by five by two is 80 . Eight by eight by two is 128 . 128 plus 80 is 208 . 400 square feet . One gallon ought to single coat it . Just keep going . Let 's do it . This is bullshit . Because Paul should be arrested for parental kidnapping . No . I can 't wait until Friday to see my little boy . Why can 't we get a court date today ? What about some kind of injunction ? There 's an Allison Weber here to see you . Well , have her make an appointment . She 's from the Department of Human Services . She says it 's important . Shit . I 'm gonna have to call you back . - I 'm sorry to surprise you like this . - Please , have a seat . But we find that when a child 's welfare is at stake ... unexpected visits are more informative . And since it 's your son 's welfare we 're talking about ... No , I understand . Of course . What can I do ? We 've received an allegation of both mental and physical child abuse against you . The allegation involves inappropriate medication . Have you been giving your son unprescribed medication ? - Where did you get this ? - Can you answer the question ? My son may have inherited ... a fatal genetic disorder and I was using this medicine as a preventative . Could I speak with his doctor ? Well , there never really was an official diagnosis . You seem like a caring mother ... but you must know that Gleevac has serious side effects . Consistent use over a prolonged period of time could kill your son . I 'm gonna recommend that you be restricted to supervised visitations ... - until family court decides ... - Wait a minute . Supervised visitations ? You can 't do that . Think about counselling , Mrs Forbes . You love your son . Maybe you could find another way to protect him . I haven 't shaved in two days . I ain 't eaten in two days . And I ain 't even taken a crap . This is not a normal infection . What was your first clue ? Tell you something else . This was just healed . Now look at it . Oh , Jesus . - We gotta call Kurt . - Yeah . - Hey . - Hey . What 's going on ? I was just wondering if everything is okay with you . Paul and I are getting a divorce . I 'm sorry . He 's taking me to court to get custody of Corey . I 'm sorry to hear that . - Is there anything I can do ? - No . No , I 'm taking care of it . I 'll say a prayer for you . Gonna get him back . Good . You get a lollipop , 'cause you didn 't cry . Great . Any idea what you 're looking for in that stuff ? I have no clue . But I 'm guessing it 's trace DNA of the guy who scratched you . Jesus Christ , we 're supposed to be painting a foyer . Put your brushes away and think of calling with a good cover story ... 'cause you ain 't going anywhere until we determine what this is . Oh , no . You getting married , there 's certain shit ... you gotta live up to . Like God and country , obedient , courteous , kind ... Wait a minute . That 's the Boy Scout pledge , ain 't it ? Yes . I believe it 's love , honour and cherish . Not that I know anything about the subject . Hey , Dad , that rash is spreading . It 's up on your neck . What ? Oh , Paige is gonna love that . You 're right . I ain 't going nowhere . - Right . - Do me a favour , will you ? Like that old broad in the Ferrari , bury me in my Mustang . Right , with a 21-gun salute . The only problem is , Chuck , you 're not dying . Then what am I doing ? So some of us are swimming the rapids ... and some of us are sinking rapidly . Mr Barnett . Mr Taggart . Mr Haines . And there you have it . Beep , beep . I 'm running you over , Mommy . That 's okay , honey . Knock it down . - Hey . Can Mommy read you a story ? - Can I watch TV ? Yeah . You gotta come up here , though , by me . See that ? - Hey , that 's my favourite show . - I know . Doorbell . - He 's early . - Only a few minutes . - You 're early . - I 'll wait . Why are you doing this ? - Jesus Christ , Paul , I am his mother . - And you need help , all right ? - I 'm not going to let you hurt our son . - I am not the one who was hurting him ! You were the one who was hurting him . I 'm just trying to do the right thing here . I will never , ever let you take my son away from me ! Here we are , Corey . - Hey , big guy . - Hi , Daddy . - Say goodbye to Mommy . - No , I don 't want to . No , it 's okay , honey . You 're just gonna go away for a little bit ... - and I 'll see you next week . - No , I don 't want to . - I know you don 't wanna go , honey . - I want you to come with us . - I can 't come with you . - Let 's go , Corey . - Come on , say goodbye to Mommy . - Please . - Now say goodbye to Mommy . - It 's okay , sweetheart . Sarah , would you let go of him ? I 'll come with you next week . I promise . - Let him go , Sarah . - I know . - Say goodbye to Mommy . - He 's holding onto me ! Say goodbye to Mommy . Let 's go . - Let 's go . Let 's go . Now let 's go . - No ! Please , Daddy , no ! I wanna stay with Mommy ! Hello . No , Mom . No , no . It 's Neil . Yeah , yeah . I borrowed Dad 's cell phone . No , I don 't know where he is . No , I 'm not lying . I 've been at Mendel 's . Idiot . Yeah . Kurt Mendel . Yeah , he 's a friend of Dad 's . No , no . I 'm sure he 's fine . He 's not sick . He 's taking antibiotics and ... Mom , Mom . Okay . Look . Listen . I 'll call you when I know something , okay ? Dad ... that was Mom . She 's worried sick about you and , frankly , so am I. You 're freaking me out . Something is connecting me to them . What ? He 's waiting for you . You 're part of him now . Dad . Something is calling . It 's scary , you know that ? Frightening even . Any thoughts ? Theories ? Anything ? Leshawn . Okay , you can start breathing now . - Whose blood is this ? Where 'd you get this ? - That 's the question I don 't want you to ask . - As a friend , I know you 'll understand . - All right . Okay . Good man . So what have we got ? I never thought I 'd see anything like this in my lifetime . Will you stop beating around the bush ? What is it ? - They 're nanites . - Nanites ? - Sounds like a religious sect . - They 're computer-driven machines ... so small they can enter the bloodstream and do shit . Nanobots . This is so advanced it shouldn 't even be in a microscope . - Dude , look at this shit . Look , look . - Calm down . Calm down . The nanobots have the capability of engineering on a molecular scale . They can rearrange matter , atom by atom . - Rearrange it into what ? - Whatever the programmer tells it to . How can things that small have individual programming ? You 're asking me ? I 'm going off a fucking theory , dude . - All right , all right . - Now give me that and calm down , man . So , in theory ... how can things that small have individual programming ? Maybe they don 't . Maybe they share some kind of hive mind . Hive mind ? Each bot carries a small chunk of the total program . Meaning they 'd have to communicate with one another . Yeah . They 'd have to do that . Sarah was concerned for Corey 's health . Overly , in my opinion , but there 's no law against that . Were you concerned that she might be unnecessarily medicating her son ... to garner sympathy for herself ? Objection , Your Honour . Assumes facts not in evidence . There 's no diagnosis of a mental disorder in my client 's medical file . - Dr Egrari has a medical degree . - She 's a paediatrician . I 'm only asking her expert opinion , not a medical diagnosis . I 'll allow it . - Were you concerned about Mrs Forbes ? - It crossed my mind . But I believe she would never hurt Corey . Several months ago , you overrode your paediatrician 's advice ... and insisted on extensive intestinal screenings for your son . Can you explain to the court why you thought this was necessary ? Corey is starting to show the symptoms . He 's tired . He has trouble eating , frequent stomachaches . - That 's lies . - Mr Forbes . Sorry , Your Honour . Let 's proceed . So based on these vague symptoms , you put your son on Gleevac ? I was afraid . This particular form of cancer has a 98 % mortality rate in children . What about Gleevac 's side effects ? Liver toxicity could be fatal . It may not have been the right decision ... but I was only trying to do what 's best for my son . Your mom gave you lots of medicine , didn 't she , Corey ? How did you feel about that ? Did you like it ? - No ? Why not ? - It hurts my tummy . I throw up . - Did you tell your mommy about that ? - Yeah . She said it was okay . I shouldn 't tell anyone . She said she was a doctor now . No . No fucking way . Nanobots only exist in theory . It 's gotta be something else . Well , that 's what we thought , and we thought wrong . By the way , those antibiotics he was on are totally useless . As you can see , the effects of the contagion , for want of a better word ... seem to be progressing in stages of transformation . Okay . All right . If that 's the way it is ... then he seems to be about at the same stage as the guy we found in the lab . What are these nanobots programmed to do ? Well , that 's the most fascinating aspect of this condition , if you will . The nanobots are man-made ... and their sole purpose is to reconfigure tissue ... at a molecular level into structures that are both man and machine . It 's fucking unbelievable . All right , Kurt . Hey , listen . This is not some science project . Okay ? You 're not gonna win the Nobel Prize . This is my father . Well , you ask questions , I provide answers . Contrary to what you think , I am trying to find a way to save him . Forgive me if I 'm not Florence fucking Nightingale . Okay . Just try and curb your enthusiasm , all right ? All right . Take a look at this . What am I becoming ? Neil , are you in there ? Neil ! Oh , shit . It 's my mom . All right . Let 's keep cool-headed . Chuck , get out of here . - Hello . - What 's wrong ? - Where 's your father ? - Mom , we should go . - Are you trying to keep me out ? - No , no , no . Of course not . No . Whatever little game you 're playing , it 's not gonna work . - Mom . - I will come back with the police if I have to . Mrs Taggart , I doubt if you remember , we 've met before . Get out of my way ! - Go home , Paige . Go home . - Chuck . - What are you doing here ? - Well , he 's fine . - He 's just caught up in a little project . - Who the fuck are you ? - That 's my husband . - Paige , this does not concern you . Go home . Are you in some kind of trouble ? Are you sick ? - Speak to me , Chuck . - I am speaking to you , Paige ... but you are not listening . I said go home ! Get the fuck out of here ! Now ! - Mom . He 's gonna be okay . - What is going on ? I will not tolerate this . Your father has not been himself since Ed Scrivens ' death . Now you tell me what is going on ! I can 't . You better tell me why you talked to her like that ! I 'll tell you why . That 's why . That 's why . Oh , my God . Hey , Mom . - How was training today ? - It was good . - Could you set the table , please ? - Oh , sure . It 's just us . Dad and Neil are with a friend . - Who ? - Kurt somebody . Mendel . Mom , is there something wrong ? Are you okay ? - Your father left . - What ? I know it 's all part of the same thing ... this story he told me . Going back in time . Being rescued by aliens . - Whoa , whoa . Mom , what story ? - Take it up with your father . I don 't know . He has completely shut me out of his life . I don 't know what 's happening to him , but I know what 's happening to us . Jesus , Mom . Right , it 'll be okay . I 'll be okay . We had 25 good years . And we raised two wonderful sons . Okay . Neil 's a work in progress , but he 's gonna be a good man . And you ... You have never let me down . No , really . I need to talk to him . Where is he ? - Dad doesn 't check in with me , man . - Yeah , well , Mom said you were with him . Why isn 't he staying here ? This whole thing 's messed up . Hey , why don 't you give him a break ? He 's got some issues he 's dealing with right now , all right ? - Yeah , well , he 's treating Mom like shit . - Marc , they 'll work it out . - Look , I gotta get out of here . - No . You need to focus . - I want answers . - Marc , get out of my way . - What the fuck , man ? What 's your problem ? - You 're my fucking problem . Damn it ! Marc ! - Neil ! - It 's not the goddamn time , Marc ! - Stop it ! - Fuck you ! Marc ! Fucker . Well , that 's real handsome . - Tissue sample would be helpful , Chuck . - To whom ? - Crispy dumplings with soba noodles . - I didn 't eat that shit when I needed to eat . Kurt , what 's happening to me is years ... it 's millenniums beyond the capacity of human science . That tissue sample won 't mean shit . - Now how would you know that ? - Just ' cause I know it . Just ' cause it 's in my brain and I know it . Just like I know if I put this drop of water in the palm of my hand ... hold my palm very still ... Watch that . - That 's amazing . - Sure as hell is . It 's just another one of the talents that comes along with not being human . Like feeling no pain . - Go ahead and do your damn tissue sample . - All right . Hold still . Here we go . Dad , this turning synthetic , this is not a good thing . - Well , at least I still bleed a little bit red . - Yeah , well , you gotta fight it . Neil , you don 't know what you 're saying , Son . This ain 't like messing around with the software . This is hardwired into me . - This is like trying to change my hard drive . - Your what ? It 's my body on a molecular level . - I can 't change it . - Well , then you 've gotta use your mind . It 's more advanced now . You said so yourself , and it 's the only weapon we have . I don 't know . I don 't know . Even if you can intercept the nanobot signals , what good would it do ? Look , man , I don 't know . Okay . Something , I hope . How brilliant . That 's gonna help . Shit ! - Signal strength 's too low , man . - Get up . - What ? - Get up . Be my guest . What are you doing ? Dad , you broke the antenna . Jesus . They 're talking with one another . They 're exchanging information . - They 're programming . - I don 't know what this is . Wait a minute . If those are the instructions the nanobots are firing at one another ... is there a way to reprogram them ? To order them to reverse what they 've done ? Yeah . I mean , maybe . If we could figure out the language . But this . This is beyond us . This is like showing Java to a caveman . We could work on this a million years and never figure this out . Well , there 's gotta be somebody who knows how to . The Sentient . - Can you ask him ? - Ask him ? Yeah , man . Damn it . Listen to me . Is there some way you can connect with him ? No , no . It could take him over . - That 's a terrible idea , Neil . - What is your problem ? You 're undermining everything that I say . Neil . Neil , your dad is hanging on to his humanity by a thread ... and this could be the thing that snaps it . - Yeah . You got a better idea ? - None with happy endings . Kurt , you and Neil go stand behind me . Just go stand behind me . Do it . Now . What 's going on ? - Dad ? - No , no . - I am not going with you . - You 're one of us now . No , I am not . I still bleed red . Our Sentient has a plan for you . Well , you tell him his plan is not my plan . His plan is not the plan . You go tell him he does not want me on board . I 'll bring down your goddamned house . I 'll level your whole fucking world ! Dad ? Chuck , Chuck ! No . Chuck . Chuck ! Dad ! No . It 's Neil . It 's your son . This is your son , Chuck . - It 's your son . - Dad . I don 't know who I am . I don 't know who I am . My dad left my mom . Moved in with a friend , Kurt Mendel . What else ? I don 't know . I guess it all started when Ed Scrivens died . - What all started ? - His changes , his attitude . - I don 't know . Whatever . - Changes ? Look , I don 't know anything else , okay ? Well , that would be disappointing , because then I couldn 't help you . I found those . Good . - Is that all ? - Well , isn 't that enough ? - I 'll see what I can do . - No , that 's not gonna fly . - That 's not what you said before . - Oh , remind me what I said . Look , I didn 't do this to get jerked around . Okay ? No , what you did was spy on your famous father . - Isn 't that what you said ? - What 's your point ? My point , Marc , is that someone in your position stays humble . You 're flaming out of the astronaut programme . You sold out your own father to save your ass . - Fuck you . - Sit down ! That 's better . Now , as I was saying ... I will see what I can do ... but I 'm gonna need more from you . The left brain and part of the right are already synthetic ... but there 's a small portion of the affective and emotional centre that 's still human . When there 's nothing human left , kill me . Right . Remind me to load the.45. Don 't be ridiculous , Chuck . I won 't be part of them . I won 't be the enemy . - I 'll do it myself . - Hey , Dad . You 've got to hear me . You cannot give up . There has to be a way out of this . - Listen to him , Chuck . - Now look . I know it might sound crazy , but my mind keeps going back to the Sentient . Now you said that something was trying to contact you . It 's trying to bring you over to its side . Well , you gotta use the fuckers , Dad . Make them tell you how to fix this . Hey , what the hell happened ? Hey , you all right ? Stay here . No . What the hell was that ? You are not going out of here by yourself . This is my world and you don 't belong . Stay here . I don 't belong ? He 's waiting for you . - Who ? - Our Sentient . - Explain " our Sentient " . - It is everything . We are it , synthesized into its mind . One . It is your creator . Show me how you made me . Show me how you made me . Welcome . I am done here . Here . Dad . Dad . I 'll never get used to that . I know their language and how to talk to them . - The nanobots ? - Yeah . They 're not really all that smart . They just need to be told what to do . Freeze that , Kurt . - What 's the verdict ? - We 're in the red . Welcome back , Chuck . I feel like I 've been on a five-day drunk . Excuse me . What was it like , being almost synthetic ? Well , I 'll tell you . When I hooked up with that Sentient , it was like ... I never dreamed I could feel so alone . You know , it kind of made me understand why some people look for ... a little more than just a physical reality to get them through a day . You know , like maybe understand why people go to church . You know what I 'm saying ? You know , there are a fair number of people who are convinced ... that Chuck Taggart was never fully human . If the other side had the nano-virus , why aren 't we all synthetic ? 'Cause it don 't work . - I beg to differ , Chuck . - It doesn 't , Kurt . Even though I was fully synthetic , there was something inside me fought back . - What fought back ? - I don 't know . Something wanted me to stay what I was , which is human . I don 't know what it was . - Call it soul . - Oh , please . - And I 'd like to thank God ... - Shut up , Kurt . It 's beautiful . I 'm sorry to burst your bubble ... but what changed him back was not his soul . It was his son . His son never giving up ... forcing us to find a way to reprogram those nanobots . That 's what it was . Hello . He ruled already ? What did he say ? Yeah . Okay . Hello , Paige . - What are you doing here ? - I came back . I was sick and I was afraid whatever I might have , I might pass it on to you . - But you weren 't afraid to give it to Neil . - Neil is part of it . Oh , stop it , Chuck . I don 't wanna hear the spaceman speech again . Paige , whatever happens to us from here on ... whether you walk up those stairs and I walk out that door ... whether we stay together or no ... I came back here 'cause I need from you , faith . Faith in a possibility that just maybe ... just maybe what I 've been telling you about what happened to me is true . - That you 're here from the future ? - That 's right . Chuck , I don 't even feel that you 're here now . Then what do you want me to say , Paige ? I mean , what 's gonna do it for you ? - What 's gonna get it done ? - Honesty . - I 'm being honest . - Really ? When you disappear in the middle of the night ... with our youngest son ... while your oldest son thinks you 've gone completely around the bend ... and your only explanation is some claptrap out of a comic book ... about " an alien sent me back to save the world . " - You are the only alien around here , Chuck . - Do you really think that 's what it is , Paige ? Do you really think I 'm having an affair ? Paige , if I was having an affair ... I could come up with 1,000 better lies ... than telling you something as psychotic as being sent back in time . You don 't believe that . You 're just hanging on to this affair thing ... because you cannot conceive that what I 've been telling you may be the truth . That Neil and I need your help . We desperately need your help . We 're going to go upstairs ... and you can begin at the beginning ... and walk me through this , one more time ... very slowly .

 Nichiei News Godzilla raids Tokyo ! TOKYO , 1954 Godzilla , the king of monsters , raided Tokyo . It turned to a sea of fire . After Japan 's miraculous postwar recovery , Tokyo suffered another massive destruction . The nuclear bomb brought it back to life ! What can mere humans do ? Just let it wreak havoc ? Two months later , Tokyo was on its way to reconstruction . Japan 's capital moved to Osaka . The country once again started to rebuild TOKAI VILLAGE , 1966 12 years after Godzilla 's raid . Japan 's first nuclear power plant was destroyed by Godzilla . The Premier has decided . To give up nuclear power plants ? Yes . Godzilla landed to feed on the radioactivity from nuclear plants The government ruled against having nuclear power plants . But the steadily growing demand for electricity kept the government busy Water , fire , wind and even sunlight were used . But they couldn 't replace nuclear energy . So ... OSAKA , 1996 The Science and Technology Bureau established an institute in Osaka , the capital , to develop clean energy . Our mission is to create clean energy that can 't tempt Godzilla . Our daily study and efforts have finally borne fruit : Plasma-generating using heavy hydrogen as fuel Plasma-derived electricity was put to practical use . But ... NAKANOSHIMA , OSAKA There are some people you want to protect at all costs Even if you 're afraid , don 't run . Fight ! Understand ? Yes Tsujimori . Yes Twelve rangers are here Dismissed ! Thirty years after Tokai Village , Godzilla appeared in Osaka . No matter how huge , it 's an animal . Kill it ! Aim at its legs . Hit them Tsujimori , wait at the Factory . Got it ! Oishi , forward ! Takei , go up to Point 9 Level your guns ! Ready to fire . It 's coming ! Now ! Fire ! Pull back ! Hurry ! Attack it from behind ! Fire ! Godzilla reaching East 400 . Pull back ! It 's coming ! Pull back ! Hurry up ! Cover Takei ! Roger ! Advance ! Get ready ! Fire ! Tsujimori , stay in front . Got it ! - OK ! - Hurry up ! Takei ! Forward ! Face Godzilla ! Got it ! - Aim at its head ! - Yes ! Fire ! - Pull back ! - Hurry up ! Oishi ! It 's heading for the factory ! Pull back ! Pull back ! Let me fire once more ! Forget it . Why ? That 's an order . Godzilla vs. Megaguirus Akihabara , Tokyo , 2001 I 'll do it again . Watch me . Rice , Curry powder ... and pickles . Wait five seconds . Curry and rice ! Wow ! The bowl is a microwave oven . Mix the stuff with the machines and heat it . No ? Oh , no ! Let 's go to the game hall . Don 't disappoint the kids . They think I 'm a genius . They should learn the truth . But I admire you . You made these small but powerful machines . Few can do it . So what ? Why are you flattering me ? I came to scout you . " Self-Defense Corps Shibaura Base " How could you keep this old house ? A storehouse four years ago . Good afternoon . When Godzilla leveled Osaka in 1996 , the government collected data on the monster . They formed a Counter-Godzilla Headquarters in the Defense Corps . The leakage of radioactivity invited Gozilla . No leakage , no Godzilla . That won 't settle the problem . Godzilla won 't appear , if it 's dead . That 's why we 're here . S-1 is seeking Godzilla . S-2 is studying it as a living being . S-3 is simulating how to evacuate Osaka . Search , study and shelter . Each word starts with " S " And we 're the combat troop called G-graspers . Hosono , the pilot . Niikura , the spokesman . Hi ! Mima , the operator . He was on a sub . Okumura was a ranger , like me . Me , Kiriko Tsujimori , the leader . Kudo ! Miss Yoshizawa . I was your student at school . I learned physics from you . Kudo is my name . Working in Akihabara ? I like microcosm . I want you to join us . And be killed like them ? Sorry . A sad memory . That won 't happen again . To stop Godzilla , we 're making a fatal weapon . Like what ? A micro black hole using plasma energy . Black hole ? It 'll swallow Godzilla and never let it out ... forever . A black hole can swallow anything . Once caught , nothing can escape . Not even Godzilla . Don 't say you refuse . I 'm impressed . The first manmade black hole . What 's the size ? How to use it ? We 're making a pilot machine . Two meters across to be installed on a satellite . To attack Godzilla from outer space ? Great ! The earth mustn 't be harmed . So we 'll shoot the black hole into Godzilla ... if " two meters " is possible . I 'm glad to make it . Yes ! Is it G ? Heat 's rising in the Japan Trench . Depth : twenty meters . First time in three years Godzilla rose to the surface . Will it come to Japan ? Who knows ? G 's sinking . We 'll be ready . - Complete your weapon . - Yes . THREE MONTHS LATER How are you doing , kids ? Wake up early in the morning ? Your summer vacation homework ? I collected many insects . Don 't be long , We 're going to move . I 'll return this sample to Wataru . Stop ! Keep off ! You can 't go any further . My field is there . Stop here . " Primary School " All ready . I didn 't believe it when you told me the plan . But it 's real now . The discovery of plasma energy made this possible . But ... after you kill Godzilla , be sure to dispose of it . It 's a promise . Sure . There 's no problem . I 'm ready . All set . Everybody , to your post ! All back to the safety position . All back to the safety position . Execute the command . You 'll go down in history . What 's that ? Contorted dimensional space . Before confirming the safety ... Successful . We made it ! How did you get in ? It 's off limits . What is it ? He was there . He saw the experiment . All right . Will you promise me ? What ? No mention of what you saw here . Not to Dad or Mom ? Are you a G-grasper ? Yes . You 're a woman . Why are you fighting Godzilla ? Not scared ? Can you promise me ? Good . ' Bye , Dr. Insect . SHIBUYA , TOKYO Tokyo is nice . Next time Dad gets a transfer , he 'll have to go alone . No garbage today . Bring it tomorrow . No use building your body . Why ? Godzilla will disappear in the black hole we make . Keep this . The signal bomb has a micro transmitter ? I made it for you . When in danger , shoot it . I 'll find you and come to your rescue . Build your body first . Miyagawa . Boyfriend ? Our senior officer . Godzilla killed him ... in Osaka in 1996 It 's his dogtag . His will is bequeathed by Tsujimori . Can I test it ? Will it be on a satellite ? Unlike the schoolhouse , Godzilla is mobile . You 'll aim at Godzilla from space ? No obstacles between . Good idea . We reserved a satellite . I want to sleep . Keep awake . I 'll get you a bonus . Can 't you do it alone ? Water leaks here , too . Strange . Shall we dig here ? Troublesome . Right . Are you going to dig all the streets ? Impossible ! That 's our job . Oh , no ! - Not my hair ! - Why do you get mad about your hair ? Care for a drink ? - Beer ? - Well ! - Wait there . - OK ! - I 'll buy it . - Bother you ! Yuji ! Beer for you . Where ... ? It 's not your fault , Dr. Insect . But , if only I hadn 't taken the egg ... We 're to blame . The experiment caused it . The huge insect appeared from it . You asked me why a woman fights Godzilla . When you 're afraid , don 't run . Fight ! He said that . My superior officer . He fought Godzilla . So I do . Makes sense ? This is called Meganulon . It grew into Meganula and flew away last night . It 's gone ! Look at this . Sent from G Satellite . the Pacific . We analyzed the light Its spectrum is extraordinary . Godzilla ? Heat ? Radioactivity ? Calculating . Enlarge it . On monitor . - Enlarge 250 times . - Closer . - Enlarge 800 times . - Closer . Enlarge 2300 times . Godzilla ! Spitting heat rays at his enemy . Is that his enemy ? Meganula . It 's radioactive . Godzilla . Scramble ! Griffon ready to take off . Fighter Griffon Griffon , take off . There ! - Vertical flight . - Yes . It stinks ! What 's this smell ? Underwater mike away . Tsujimori . Dangerous ! Godzilla ? It 's near . Under you . Up ! Leader ! Leader ! Don 't shoot ! She 's there ! What are you doing ? It 's dangerous ! Divert G 's attention from her . Sure ! Are you okay ? I put a bug on Godzilla . Drop an SGS . Got it You can 't get away this time . SGS ( Search Godzilla System ) Dimension Tide ? okay ? Send it to Tan Island . " Tan Island Space Center " Dimension Tide ( Black Hole Gun ) The giant dragonfly found on the Pacific is Meganula . It lived about 280 to 360 million years ago in the Carboniferous period . Called Meganulon as a larva . It grows in the water , then sprouts wings to become Meganula . What 's wrong ? Meganula makes clusters . It 's a violent insect . Terrible ! We 're above Shibuya , Tokyo . A flood swallowed the streets . Undergound waterways seemed to have caused it . The reason is unknown . Rescue troops are approaching the area , but the streets around Shibuya are filled with refugees . Traffic is jammed ... We can not predict how the pressure 's going now ! Check Shibuya . You like this ? A micro GSG ? It has an infrared camera , too . - Show me the bottom . - No problem ! What 's that ? Eggs ! Ogasawara Trench , Pacific Ocean A love letter from your bug . 27 degrees 30 minutes North , 143 degrees east , off Chichi Island . Look at this . There ! Don 't miss it ! Roger ! Defense Bureau , Osaka Godzilla went north . It 's in this area now . In order to use our weapon , Dimension Tide , against Godzilla , We must drive it onto land so we can aim it from outer space . There 's a small island in Godzilla 's path Kiganjima . 3 Kilos round , uninhabited . When Godzilla lands there , the Dimension Tide will wipe it out . It sounds wonderful . But can the SF-like weapon really kill Godzilla ? How can we trust it ? What if it results in a disaster ? That won 't happen . If we hesitate , we 'll live to regret it . Please cooperate with us . What 's that ? No joking . The OS in it is unlike any other . It 's my original creation . It checks the programs ten times faster . Now , my dear nurse , check the DT . Mr. Sugiura ! We didn 't test it in outer space . It 's not yet for practical use . Machines need fine adjustments by men . You know nothing . I ... I trust the doctor 's skill . I see . Anyway , we 'll try our best . Hurry , Kudo ! Teacher ! Alpha Base , start operation as soon as you see the target . Lock on target . Dragon-arrows away . Photon gun , fire ! G 's approaching the island . I 'll drive it to Point B. Unit 3 . We 're on Dogen Slope . Headquarter , we 'll get it . You guys team up . Rid the squares of eggs . Roger . Leader ! Fire ! G 'll land soon . DT , stand by . Okay ! We 're waiting in stand-by mode . DT operation , start ! 300 seconds to launch . Godzilla is landing ! Dragonflies ! Emergency ! Giant dragonflies appeared . A cloud of Meganula ! Meganula ! We 're ready to fire . I 'm set . Shall I ? Wipe them Out ! Obstacles in auto-sensing system . I can 't lock on . Accuracy less than 50 % Try . Don 't miss this chance . The dragonflies think Godzilla is a tank of energy . Meganula reduced in number . We 'll fire . Keep distance . Alright ! Target lock on . Dimension Tide , fire ! Now in cooling mode . G 's intact . Dimension Tide missed ! What are you waiting for ? Fire ! It takes an hour to cool the gun . Why ? G 'll surely come to Tokyo , to the National Institue of chemistry in Shibuya . I thought we shut off neutron completely . I stopped the project immediately . I 'll keep you safe , Prime Minister . Please rest assured . You mean it was my fault ? Yes ! You 're to blame . I said machines need adjusting . Stop it . We all want to beat Godzilla . We adjusted the machine . We 'll succeed next time . I 'm sorry . Search with SGS ... along the course from Tokyo to the island where Godzilla vanished . You think it 'll hit Tokyo ? I 'm not sure . But we must be prepared for the worst case . I brought a new one . Bother you ! - It 's Line 417 . - OK ! This is 06 , please report the situation I don 't get it . It can 't be broken easily . Other gauges and meters are in trouble . Wireless , too . There might be something magnetic in the lake . What 's that ? Headquarters ! There 's a new monster ! High frequency wave ! Escape ! Run to safety ! Don 't move . A bone fracture . You die hard . Disappointed ? It was huge . The king of Meganula . That 's Megaguirus . Megaguirus ? It was chosen among the Meganula troop , like a queen bee . A fossil Meganula , too , was found deep in China . Megaguirus is a fighter . It kills enemies and expands its territory . That 's the strategy of its species . SGS has spotted Godzilla . Stay in bed . Where ? Five Kilos off Hachijo . The chief was right . Godzilla will come to Tokyo . Godzilla might land at Tokyo . The government gave warning . It can reach Japan 's Pacific coast around Tokyo this afternoon . Evacuate the Tokyo Bay area quickly ... We have security and patrol in this area - Run . Hurry up ! - What are you doing ? When will Godzilla land ? In five hours . We 'll tell later where it 'll land . I 'm afraid it 's too late . People are evacuating Tokyo . Don 't try to fan their fear . Where are you going ? Where 's your dad ? Come on , hurry What attracts G to Tokyo ? It raided Tokai in 1966 to feed on the nuclear energy of the power plant . In 1996 , it came to Osaka for plasma energy . But in Tokyo , no facility produces such energy . It 's approaching Odaiba . Scramble ! If Godzilla lands , draw it to the pier to save buildings . Roger . Down 50 ... 40 ... 30 ... 20 ... Godzilla 's going to surface . There ! Godzilla is in sight . Photon gun , fire ! Be a good boy and come here . What ? Megaguirus is here ! Megaguirus ? Dimension Tide , stand by . Kill Godzilla and Megaguirus together ! Roger ! What now ? 120 seconds to ignition . What 's wrong ? What happened ? DT in trouble . Can 't control it ! Why ? Megaguirus 's high frequency wave destroyed its program Control system in trouble DT won 't work ! What 's wrong ? It 'll be all right . Forced landing . I can 't set a backup file ! Magaguirus ' wave foulded up our electrical system . Damn it ! Not yet ? I 'll do it . Kudo ! Can you fix DT ? Who knows ? Kudo ? How 's your wound ? Forget it . Don 't worry about me . I 'm worried about Dimension Tide . I must do it . It 's my job . It 's to be done . It depends on my original OS to control DT . I got it ! - Here we go , Kiriko ! - Kiriko ? The leader ? No ! DT has begun to fall . Damn ! Too late . I 'll try to hold it . Where to ? - OK ! - Get ready at B spot . Try hard . - Mr. Sugiura . - Yes ? What are you hiding ? Answer me ! It 's heading for Shibuya . Got it ! Okay ! We can 't use the photon gun , but Griffon can fly . Take off ! No more fuel . The satellite is falling ! The Institute of Science ! Why is Godzilla there ? What 's in the Institute ? Plasma energy . They dropped the plan because it might tempt Godzilla , didn 't they ? It 'll bring tremendous wealth to our country . And a high position for you . Every country has a secret or two It benefits the nation . We shut off neutron completely . But Godzilla has come . Your stupidity invited it . How many human lives fell victim ? So I organized this G-grasper group . But it 's a gang of asses ! Tsujimori . Tsujimori don 't You wasted their lives ! It 's me , Kudo . Hear the angel 's voice . 110 seconds to launch . You fixed it ! Yes But DT is still falling . No time left . DT entered the atmosphere ! Auto-sensing system in trouble . Oh , no ! I can 't lock on . You can 't Is the system alive ? Yes . If we lock on , we can shoot DT . I 'll try . How ? Lock on me . I 'll get above Godzilla . Then shoot . Dangerous ! You 'll die ! This is my job . Leader ! I 'll go alone . Stand by to launch . What 's the focus point ? 354-1394-68200 . 150 seconds to detonation of DT . Long enough . It 's about time . Now ! Target lock on ! We make it ! Tsujimori . Don 't die ! DT has begun to melt ! - 60 seconds to explosion . - Roger . Lock on the target . Ready ? Here we go ! Anytime ! Let me do it . Dimension Tide , fire ! Fire ! Kudo here . You alive ? Answer me ! You want to hear my voice ? You got a crush on me ? How 's Godzilla ? Gone . We won . Search for the target . Check the damage ... Godzilla 's vanished . Game over . We did it ! Although exploitation of plasma energy was dropped five years ago . the Institute staff continued it by order of the Prime Minister and the Chief of Counter-Godzilla Headquarters ? Next week they 'll be called to the Diet as witnesses . There 's an epicenter under Tokyo . What if Godzilla escaped Dimension Tide ? Is this Godzilla ? Give me your hand again . No . I don 't want to be involved . So you 're chicken . I was joking . Why not ? Who else can replace me ? I said the bone 's broken . Sorry . Special Effects by KENJI SUZUKI Directed by MASAAKI TEZUKA I 'll put these back . We 'll be at the gate .

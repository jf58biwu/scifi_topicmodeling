 Good news , everyone ! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up ? Sure , we talk about it all the time . - Really ? - No . Burn ! Well done , fellows ! Anyway , said orphanarium has named Leela " Orphan of the Year ! " cheering Your parents must be so proud ! Sorry . And the good news keeps on coming . Behold my latest invention ! ALL : Whoa . BEEPlNG I  s a glow - in - the - dark nose you can wear over your regular non - glowing nose . Observe . AMY : Whoa ! Cool ! BENDER : Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark . FARNSWORTH SNEEZES Where 'd it go ? Hey , professor , wha  s all this scroop blurking out of the machine ? That ? I  s nothing . Yes , nothing . If you think i  s anything , you 're a suspicious moron . It looks like toxic waste . And it smells like toxic waste ! What does it taste like ? Delicious fig pudding ! Tha  s good . But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste . All right , all right . So the machine produces a few toxic byproducts . You don 't have to make a federal case of it . I 'm afraid I do . I order you to dispose of that toxic waste or bribe me . Either way , i  ll cost $ 500 . Five hundred real dollars ? Tha  s an outrage ! Professor , I 'll take care of that waste for $ 499 and 1 00 cents . I know tha  s a rip , but I 'll pay for the convenience . - Do you take credit cards ? - Le  s find out . All right , environment , you 've met your match . CHUCKLES whistling spitting Hey , get back in the sewer , weirdie . No mutants on the surface . But he ruined my wedding dress ! Honey , that thing was ruined the minute it went on you . Tha  s what I 'm talking about . I  s not easy being an orphan . Not if I have anything to do with it . Oh , God . But today 's honoree , Turanga Leela , has really made something of herself . I 'll never forget the night that cute alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep because I have a photographic memory , and I remember every night . DOORBELL chimes BABY COOlNG v OGEL : What the- - ? An alien language ? I guess you 're an alien . What a beautiful , gigantic eye you have- - Well , come on in . From those humble beginnings Leela went on to become a county - certified starship captain . And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni . Thank you very much . Like many of you , I never knew my parents . I don 't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side . - Picture 's up . - l  s crooked ! In the end , though , it doesn 't matter who my parents were . All that matters is what I learned here , within these unscalable walls that I had the strength to make it on my own . Just like all of you kids here today . cheering Leela ! Leela ! Leela ! Look at me ! I 'm Leela ! No ! Because I 'm double Leela ! Whee ! Tha  s it , Albert . No more espresso for you ! Mind if we get a picture of you with your picture ? Yes ! I mean , no ! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side . Whoo ! LEELA sobbing If those aren 't tears of happiness , please stop crying . I  s okay , Fry. I 'm fine . I won an award today . is it this room tha  s making you sad ? I  s probably the room . Come on , le  s go for a walk . LEELA : I 'm sorry you saw that , Fry . I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness . Yeah , I do that with my stupidness . I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong . But all I really wanted was a mom and dad to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they love me . Then today 's your lucky day because I happen to be a holding , stroking , loving machine . Also spanking . Tha  s not even close to what I had in mind . Well , anyway , just remember that people care about you . I know . Sometimes , when I 'm lonely I look up at the sky , and I get this feeling that somewhere on some unknown planet circling a distant star my parents are up there looking down on me . humming Yo , yo , Bazender ! What up ? My dumping business is booming . I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Wi / / y 3 ! GROANlNG Bender , cut it out ! First of all , the sewer mutants will be mad . Second , everything else tha  s horribly wrong with what you 're doing . Those stupid mutants can 't do anything . You seem to be forgetting one simple fact . Namely , I 'm up here , and they are safely down- - screaming screaming What did I do to deserve this ? Behold ! Our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake . The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are ! Oh , man . As if our lives weren 't miserable enough already . - Tell me about it . - Let the punishment commence ! - Punishment ? - No fair . Bender 's innocent ! The instant you touch these mutateous waters your DNA will be forever altered turning you into horrible mutants like us ! - Especially him . - Oh . Allow me to demonstrate . WHlMPERlNG GROANlNG I  s like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan . Submerge the prisoners ! BENDER babbling Wait. I don 't even have DNA . Why am I screaming ? We 're gonna beat you afterwards . BENDER screaming ALL : Mutate ! Mutate ! Mutate ! MOM : Turanga Leela ! Who said that ? How do you know my real name ? GROANlNG BENDER : Whee ! What are you doing ? Stop them ! - What happened ? - l don 't know . I think I saved us somehow . Go after them ! The waters can 't mutate us mutants ! MUTANT : They went this way . Quick , in there ! MUTANT : Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! LEELA : Great Cheech 's ghost ! BENDER : Wha  s this junk ? It looks like a timeline of my whole life . Tha  s when we saved Earth from an asteroid of garbage . Here 's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while . And this is just last year at Space Mardi gras . I  s like some kind of weird Leela Museum . - And I 'm the Leela ! FRY : Dude , over here ! I  s all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet ! Those are some of my diary pages ! And my screenplay ! And also , for some reason , the letter l wrote you full of my personal feelings . Oh , I 'm scared . My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant ! MUTANT 1 : In here ! MUTANT 2 : Capture them ! And then Bender ran . Leela , freak out later . We 're not done escaping yet . GROANlNG - Got you . - Take this ! Ow ! This time , I 'm calling for the death penalty . Not just because I 'm running for reelection as supreme mutant . MUTANTS : Four more years ! Four more years ! whispering v ery well . Your attention ! Instead of being tortured to death the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return ! Oh , cruel fate ! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage ? Wait a minute . Why aren 't you gonna kill us anymore ? Yeah ! What are you , chicken ? Shut up , you two . We can kill ourselves when we get home . They 'll need transportation to the surface . Bring in the airship ! Ew ! We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy 's parade balloons . Underdog 's groin , Bart Simpson 's left ear and right shin Garfielïs owner John 's forehead . Fire up the sewer gas ! coughing Move it , you ugly normals ! Whoa ! WHlMPERlNG I 'm getting dizzy ! I can 't walk straight ! humming FRY WHlMPERlNG Come on , Leela . You can do it ! BENDER : Hurry ! We 're missing our bus ! FRY : Hey , what are you doing ? BENDER : I 'm getting on the bus ! Don 't worry ! I 'll be fine ! They know something about me , and I 've got to find out what . The lake didn 't mutate me . What is going on here ? It worked for me. I used to be a little blond girl named virginia . Ew ! GASPS Who the hell are you ? No one . And watch your language , young lady ! Stop right there ! I don 't wanna hurt you . I didn 't want you to hurt me either . Leela 's nuts. I can 't save her unless I learn more about her past . Isn 't there anything else you can tell me ? Nothing that wouldn 't be a waste of your time . Tha  s impossible , because my time is worthless ! Well , then there is one thing . I  s the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned . But i  s written in Alien - ese , so no one on Earth can translate it . Not even Brainzilla . - Hand it over ! - Sure . I just wish I could be more helpful . Would you like some dirt on any other orphans ? I 'm trying to save someone here . I 'll have to come back for those later . - Can you translate it ? - Of course . But only into Beta - crypt - three a language so complex , there 's even less chance of understanding it . I didn 't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy . v ery well . - Doesn 't that machine make noses ? - lt can do other things . Why shouldn 't it ? Of course , even if it is possible to analyze the message there 's no way of knowing how long it will take . It could take an hour , or it could take 1 00 million years . DlNGlNG - ls it done ? - Certainly not . Two dings means i  s done . DlNGlNG But not like that . Slightly more rapid . DlNGlNG GASPS Where did they go ? Good news , Leela ! I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy . SCREAMS LEELA : Ew ! snoring DlNGlNG Tha  s it ! I  s done ! I can 't believe it ! My mind is boggling ! The analysis of the note is printing out now . NURSE : I  s a girl . - My God ! She 's beautiful ! No extra anythings . MUMBLlNG What people skills ! She 's completely perfect . In my professional opinion , as an ear , ear , ear , nose and throat doctor she is the least mutated mutant ever born . And yet , she 's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant like all of us ! Especially him ! I  s true . Maybe we can do better for her . I made this bracelet so that in some small way , we 'll always be with you even when it doesn 't seem like it . During your entire life , for example . You won 't pass for human , cutie . But if my Ph. D. in exolinguistics is worth diddlypoop this note should convince them you 're an alien . And tha  ll be enough to give you a real life . DAD : She 'll never know we 're her parents . Tha  s our gift to her . Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin . I 'm with you . v OGEL : I guess you 're an alien . What a beautiful , gigantic eye you have- - Well , come on in . holding BREATH WATER splashing MOM : Keep quiet so she doesn 't hear us . DAD : Wha  s to talk about ? - Shh ! LEELA : Hands up ! - Tentacles too ! MOM : Don 't say anything stupid , Morris . What is all this ? Am I a game to you ? Or some kind of even more boring Truman show ? Do you believe I 'm your messiah ? The mutant Dalai Lama ? Stop me if I guess it ! DAD : Well , actually- - MOM : Morris ! And what about this ? Where 'd you get this bracelet ? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby ? Or from my parents ? You robbed my parents , didn 't you ? I bet you sick mutants killed them ! My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth , and you killed them ! is that it ? Admit it ! Yes . We killed them . You guessed the truth . SCREAMS Because of you , I 'll never know my parents ! I 'll kill you ! That would be best . FRY : Stop ! Thanks , Bender ! Don 't do it , Leela ! - They killed my parents ! - Close . - They are my parents . - Yes . I had the professor analyze the Alien - ese letter that was found with you . - What does it say ? - l don 't know . But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper . A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers . It says , " Your parents love you very much . " We still do . So I 'm not an alien ? I 'm a mutant ? We never wanted you to know . You deserved a better life . You must despise us . You 're my parents . All I 've ever wanted is to know you . This is the happiest moment of my life . SOBBlNG Ah .

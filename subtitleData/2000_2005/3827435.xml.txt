 Nine O 'clock . Nice shooting . Thank you . I meant Malone . I think we got them all . Don 't be so sure . They 're surrounding us . Time to leave . We 've lost them . What in God 's name ? What is this place ? Roman maybe . Or Greek , sort of . With industrial elements that 's not possible . Is that a train track . It looks just like a piece of the Second Avenue ' L ' . And one rail . It can 't be . Its a thousand years old . Or more . Can you read that ? It 's an offering . May those who read this ... be bolder , braver and wiser ... than we who have perished by ... Well go on . That 's it . This is unbelievable . It 's absolutely unbelievable . It looks like a crude map of the solar system . It 's a blueprint of the atom . What ? It 's a thousand years old ; how the hell could they know about the atom ? What are you looking for ? This ! And this is ? The missing piece . I don 't like the look of this . Get down from the platform Challenger . Challenger ! Is he alive ? At the dawn of the century ... A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible ... The existence of a prehistoric world ... The Visionary ... The Heiress ... The Hunter ... The Scientist ... and The Reporter ... All chasing the story of a lifetime ... Stranded in a savage land . Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations ... and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World - He 's breathing . - Barely His face , it 's scorched . His heart is pounding out of his chest . He 's burning up . It looks like he 's dreaming . Easy Summerlee ! Just relax you need to rest . You had us worried for a while there . What happened ? You don 't remember ? That was quite a jolt you took . It was remarkable . It 's over that 's the important thing . How are you feeling ? Exhilarated ! In fact I 've never felt more alive . Are you sure you know what you 're doing . I thought I did . Well you said you could fix it . Well I 'm a journalist not an electrician . What do you want ? You ! Amazing ! Some sort of residual charge from that light ? Which begs the question ? What the hell happened to you back there ? - Grab the girl ! - Challenger ! Challenger ! What the hell is ... Now ... you will behave ... or die . Let her go ! Now ! * No ! no ! no ! Damnit ! * Malone are you all right ? Veronica . You 're not going anywhere . I 'm fine . You 're bleeding . That 's a really nasty wound . You may have a concussion . Get him upstairs . No I have to go . No you don 't , I do . George , George get back here you 're not well . We 'll bring them home . Summerlee ! Challenger 's hurt ! What happened ? There was an explosion . We 're going to need some clean water , cloths and some soap to disinfect that burn on his face . - Easy ! - I think he 's gone into shock . Challenger ! George ... come back ... come back . It 's no good Summerlee ... wherever he is he can 't hear you . Hey , Challenger wait up , come back . At least slowdown . What ? I get the feeling there something you 're not telling us . Veronica 's in danger , right now that 's all that matters . Hold up . What is it ? This way . No , they went through here . This is where the trail leads . That 's false . Not to be difficult but Roxton 's pretty good at this sort of thing . There are six of them slavers one of them wounded slowing them down . Dirkon put that there to throw us off . Dirkon ? - Their leader . - You know this man ? Oh ! I do now . I haven 't got time for this . I 'm going after Veronica . Wait ! I admit it sounds strange ... but you 've got to trust me . They went this way . What are you clairvoyant now ? Oh my God . What ? He 's killing him . What kind of an animal are you ? He was dying anyway . He was one of your own men . He was a liability . Make sure you don 't become one . We must hurry . But wait ! What do you want to do ? Doesn 't look like we have much choice really . What if he 's right ? The man 's delusional , and it seems to be catching . I 'm just asking what if . What if the light rewired his brain ? Then we 'll get him to pick a few winning horses when we get back to civilization . Down ! down , down On your knees before Rohtah woman . I kneel before no one , much less some piece of junk . - Kneel ! - Go to hell . No bruising , not on such lovely skin . Take her . move ... woman Hey Challenger wait up . Marguerite we 've lost too much time already . I 'm going back to the other trail . I think I 'm beginning to understand . Each mind has its own frequency like a short way wireless . It 's as if I 'm a radio tuning everything in . Just have a listen to yourself Challenger . I know it sounds fantastic but it 's true . How are you picking up the signals ? She 's over there . Veronica ? I can sense her fear , sadness and pity , but she lives . Veronica is still alive . All what the hell we 've come this far . What 's happening to him ? Summerlee says we have to get him to eat . Faint hope . Hold him . - He won 't take it . - He has to . Fine you try . Any change ? He 's burning up . How can I treat him when we don 't know what 's wrong with him . Either we break his fever now or we 're going to lose him . Colder the water needs to be colder . Straight from the stream this is as cold as it gets . We are in the jungle Professor . I don 't need a lecture on thermodynamics . Now you really soak those towels and pack them around him . We 've got to get his temperature down . Is this gonna work ? It better , if it doesn 't ... Yes , yes John we all know what will happen . That one there . Stop it leave her alone . Any damage to this woman and the price falls . Those of you wishing to pay the difference may do so to be exacted very slowly . So far you 're batting a thousand . I 'd be willing to settle for a reasonable explanation . I 'd led you here , didn 't I ? Just admit there are forces at work in our universe beyond explanation I count twelve maybe as many as fifteen . Five to one . With odds like that why do I worry ? Check your loads everyone . Where 's your weapon Challenger ? I didn 't bring it . You forgot your weapon ? I don 't need it . Great . Well you 're out of the game . All right we 'll need a strategy . I 'll swing around flank them from across the base of the camp . Challenger ? So much for strategy . Are you all right ? Better now . Good I 'll be right back . Dirkon . - And you are ? - I 've come for Veronica . A fine specimen but I 'm afraid she 's not up for auction just yet . And I have not come to bid . Please release her and no one need be injured . No ! Wise choice now to drop your weapon or the girl dies . Don 't , they 'll kill us anyway . Dirkon you bring this upon yourself . Kill her . Are you hurt ? You killed him with your hand . No , with my thoughts . What 's going on ? How 'd he do that ? He 's the wrong guy to ask . There 's a reasonable explanation . I 'd like to hear it . On your feet I said on your feet . Rohtah is watching ... and his servants kneel before no man . False prophet ... trickster . Now you will kneel before Rohtah or ... I will command him to strike you down . Your God has no power over me . I do this with regret , but there can be no mercy without true worship Know this now and forever . There are no other Gods before me . Quantum reality . Everything is possible and all at the same time . I 've never been able to put my finger on it before because there 's never been a unified theory for this sort of thing . But now I understand and I understand how to harness the power . And you got this magical knowledge from the light ? Oh it 's not magic . It 's science , pure and breathtaking . Science from a vanished civilization . From Atlantis . Well there 's your reasonable explanation . Atlantis , as in the lost city ? It was destroyed thousands of years ago . It sunk to the bottom of the sea . This is where you got your information ? It was all encoded and transmitted on that beam of light . In this makes you a God now ? It burdens me with new responsibilities if that 's what you mean . Like what ? Just imagine a world rid of pestilence and drought , natural disasters , famine . Now you 're beginning to scare me . All I 'm doing is manipulating the laws of physics . How can I in good conscience allow suffering to continue ? Atlantis was destroyed Challenger and this may be why . They didn 't respect the power , it overwhelmed them . I will be wiser . I will not make the same mistakes . No you 'll make new ones . You roasted a man , a human being like you 're swatting a fly . I saved Veronica 's life . Yes you did . You also destroyed these people 's sacred God . You can be either disciple or enemy . For your sake choose wisely my friend . This is all my fault . Now you just stop that I could have done more I could have saved her . You did what you could and you nearly get yourself killed . No I 've gotta get to ... Sit down , you 're not going anywhere . Get out of my way . What you going to do , you going to hit me ? Very well go right ahead . Move ! There 's only one way you can get out Malone and that 's through me . Please , I don 't want to hurt you . I 'm sorry but you 're just going to have to take your best shot . Come on let 's get you to bed . He 's out of control . He 's still George Challenger . Is he ? So what 's the plan ? It started at the ruins with that crystal . Do you really think that 's his source of power ? If we could destroy it , it 's worth a shot . What if it doesn 't work ? Then God help us . Good work , quickly now we have much to do . Challenger ? Not now child I 'm busy . I was just wondering with these new powers of yours . Can you use them to find my parents ? In due course . What does that mean ? It means later ! Are they dead ? Is that what you 're trying to tell me ? What I 'm trying to tell you ... is compared to the millions of people who need my help ... two lives are insignificant . Insignificant ? not to me , are they alive ? Do not lay your hands on me . I don 't know what you are , but you 're not human anymore . Hold your tongue . You 're a fraud , Challenger . Let her go . We 're going home . You 're not going anywhere . Maybe you 're not tuning me in right ... check your dial . I will be needing your help Roxton , please . You 've got warriors to build your weapons . If you think affecting this type of change is easy this is a spiritual awakening , a revolution . You need to get down from the altar and take a cold shower . Mankind needs me Roxton can 't you understand that ? I can 't turn my back on them . We 're leaving in the morning . I can make you stay . I wouldn 't try it . Go ahead pull the trigger . Blundering into that light doesn 't make you the chosen one Challenger . It could 've been Marguerite or Malone even me . But it wasn 't , was it ? I discovered it , it is my destiny . I don 't want any part of your destiny . - Let 's go . - No ! I don 't want to hurt you . Then let us walk . I 'm afraid you leave me no choice . NO ! Oh ! What have you done ? He 's going to make it . I hope so . How 's he doing ? Well the fevers leveled off a bit but . It 's his pulse ... his heart . - How fast ? - It 's racing . Do you think he 's in pain ? What makes you say that ? He 's crying . She will live on in all of us , a martyr . You 're insane . I will find her parents . I will do that for her and maybe direct a grand temple in her memory . She didn 't want a temple she wanted to live . You ready ? Wait , where are you going ? We 're taking her home . You can 't . Or what you kill us too ? I can give you anything you want . Everything you dreamed up . There 's nothing you have that I want . Roxton , Marguerite , don 't desert me now . I am in need of friends as well as worshipers . What you need is a mirror to get a good hard look at what you 've become . I didn 't mean to kill her it was an accident . Only because you were aiming for Roxton . I mourn , how it hurts me . But see ... even my sadness ... brings joy to someone . What is this Challenger ... the divine being reduced to petty bribery ? That is not an answer . There are some things even diamonds can 't buy . Let 's go . I need to rest Roxton just for a minute . Sure . Here . I can 't believe she 's gone . You know I should 've ... You couldn 't have saved her . I should have killed him . Now 's your chance , go ahead shoot if it 'll make you feel any better . Shoot ! I could kill you now but I won 't . All I want to be is merciful . How badly do you want to live ? What do you want Challenger ? If I can 't have your friendship I demand your respect . Pray to me ! Go to hell . Try living without me . George please don 't do this , please . For you . George I didn 't hear you . Where are the others ? On their way . Veronica ? No ... she was so young . Arthur we need to talk . Are you my friend ? I mean truly my friend ? Please I have to know . Of course I am George you know that . Then you 'll stand by me no matter what . What on earth 's wrong George ? Nothing , not anymore . Anything you want Arthur , your heart 's desire . You just name it . Perhaps you better go downstairs and get some rest . Listen to me Arthur . I 'm offering you something , take it ! What could you possibly have that I might want ? Redemption . How did you do this ? I didn 't , you did . This is where your heart has longed to return to . Now she doesn 't have to die alone . Anna . Arthur ... It 's alright I 'm here . The pain ... I can 't bear it anymore . Shh . It 'll be better in the morning . Forgive me . Try to get some sleep . No she needs you , you fool go back . Why are you doing this to me ? Can 't you see ? You 've given yourself a second chance . Go to her . Arthur . Go , she can see you now . I 'm here Anna . Thank you . Thank you for staying , I love you . And I love you too . And I 'll never leave you my darling . No ... it can 't be . You see anything is possible . My God what 's become of you ? It was the light Arthur . It showed me so many things ... how to control time and space and the forces of nature . No , you have to give it up . Give it up . I 've barely begun . Listen to me ... you 've got to forget it . Forget it at all costs . I thought you said you were my friend and would stand by me no matter what . I 'm appealing to you as your friend . This power you described is too great for any man to bear . But I am so much more than any man now . Can 't you see that ? - Pride goeth before a fall . - This isn 't pride ... it 's reality . You 're not God . You ungrateful fool . I gave you a gift . A gift , you call that a gift ? You got all you wanted ... a chance to say goodbye to your dying wife . I didn 't give you permission to rape my memories . I helped you . You used me . How many people get a second chance ? - Arthur you been blessed . - Cursed is more like it . Look at you you 're drunk with power . I 'm alive with the possibilities of the universe . A madman . Summerlee . Likening yourself to God . Judas ! No no oh ... .. ! NOOO ! Roxton ! Marguerite ! - What 's wrong ? - His heart 's stopped . Come on you old bastard you 're not dying on me yet . What the hell 's taking so long ? Just a few more seconds . We haven 't got a few more seconds . Can 't you hurry ? I 'm winging this Veronica . Meanwhile Challenger 's dying . Dammit don 't you think I know that . I 'm a journalist I 'm not an electrician . I knew you could do it . I beg of you , help me ! You 're electrocuting him , you 'll kill him ! - He 's already dead . - Not if I can help it . Again ! Malone ! Do something ! What the hell do you want me to do ? I didn 't know how to get it started in the first place piece of junk . This may be your last chance Professor . Easy . Summerlee . Relax you need to rest . You had us worried for a while there . What happened ? You don 't remember ? That was one hell of a jolt you took . It was remarkable . It 's over that 's the important thing . Veronica ! What are you doing man ? Slavers ! You have a nasty bump on you head . We haven 't got time to argue . Slavers are coming for Veronica now just go , go ... go ! Consider that a warning . Take her . Let 's go , get out of here ! Run ! Thanks guys . That was close . Don 't thank us thank Challenger . He 's gone . What do you mean he 's gone ? The man was just dead . Well he can 't have gone far . May those who find this ... be bolder ... braver and wiser than us . I see you 've been keeping busy . I thought I 'd take a walk get some fresh air . How did you know about the slavers ? It 's complicated . Great , I 'm glad I had my secretary clear my schedule . Let 's just say I was shown a world where I was God and it wasn 't a world worth living in . Riddles huh I 've got one for you . What 's black and blue and floats down a river ? I don 't know what 's black and blue and floats down a river . A guy who makes me clear my schedule for nothing . Let 's go home . Seriously , how did you know about the slavers ? Same way I know you 'd never sell out a friend , not even for the most perfect diamond in the world . Oh ! It 's good to know even God can be wrong .

 Previously on Taken ... We took this craft apart more than ten years ago , and we still have no idea how it ran . In fact , we know less now than when we found the damn thing . The power of mind ... that is the energy source your scientists have been unable to find . What do you suggest we do ? Find someone else with unimaginable power of mind . Jacob : I 'm never gonna fly your saucer . Not ever . It 'll go easier for your mum if you help me out . I 'm not the only one that matters . Hey , Jesse . Your father was a real hero once . A real hero . Jesse 's in danger . I need to talk to him . It 's not gonna happen , Russell . What I can 't understand is why am I alive ? Maybe there 's something in the blood ... something that makes you special . Can you keep them from coming back for me ? I 'm sure as hell gonna try . Kate , Jesse 's special . They 're seeing if he 's ready . Ready for what ? Aah : Get a way from me : Aah : Mr Crawford , look at me . No , no : SALLY : He las to disappean . If they come looking for him , there can 't be a trace . That boy in Texas ... HOWARD : Tlene was a fine . The kid died , sir . Good . SALLY : Keep this safe for me , okay ?

At worst , they 'll take your mind with them when they go , and the strain of it could kill you . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . We 'll find another way . Who 's going to take the Series ?

OWEN : The craft held five , Mr President . We brought back four . This one was still alive when we brought him in . I don 't know if you 've seen the reports on that . Yes , I have . Quite a time he gave you there . And the fifth ? Uh , we never recovered that body , sir . I see . Well , it certainly doesn 't look as if they mean to attack us . What makes you say that , sir ? Well , from what you told me , if that was their intention , we 'd all be dead by now . We have one month to prove to him that our visitors are a threat . After that , he 's shutting us down and redirecting funds to the space program . The arrogant son of a bitch : I need proof that there 's a clear and present danger . I need a smoking gun , gentlemen , and I need it now . ( radio plays ) My best subject in school was algebra . People always say algebra 's hard , but that is because they don 't get how easy it is . I just loved all those " Xs . " Anything you don 't know , you just put down an " X. " Or you can go with " Ys , " or " As " and " Bs . " In real life , you have one plus one , and if it doesn 't equal two , you 're up a creek . But in algebra , it always works , no matter what the answer is . You just have to figure out what " X " is . It 's a very beautiful thing . Oh , hey , honey , let me show you . Just let me do one . Let me show you . Mum ... It 's fine , honey . Mummy is gonna fix that . Why don 't you go and lie down ? - " X " marks the spot . - How many drinks have you had ? - Several . - How many pills ? Several . Those pills are for your nerves , not to be taken willy-nilly . Willy-nilly , eh ? Lie down before you fall down : Finish your schoolwork , boys . OWEN : You 're disgusting : You sober up , or I 'll have you put someplace , and ... ( doorbell rings ) Get in bed . And don 't come out of your room until morning . Esther , no , no . I got it . I got it . Thanks . Sorry to bother you , sir . You said you wanted to see these as soon as possible . Yes , of course . Come on in . Two possibilities , sir . Both very credible . Gail Arlen ... has reported repeated encounters since 1960 . Divorced , no children , lives alone . ( coughs ) My doctor told me it would reduce my tension . Betty and Barney Hill . Encounters in 1961 on their way back from Niagara Falls . He 's a postal clerk , and she 's a child welfare worker . They 're both active in their community . They 've begun some sort of therapy using hypnosis . - They 're very solid . - Mery solid , sir . In both these cases , the people claim that they were taken aboard a craft . - Taken ? - Yes , sir . It could be just what we need . Lonely divorc√©e ... Makes up stories to get attention . Hypnosis , you say ? MARTY : Medical hypnosis , like they use on amnesia victims . No . No Negroes . It clouds the issue . - Sir ... - Just keep trying : There must be somebody out there . Yes , sir . What the Russians want is nothing less than world domination . Communism is a religion , a faith like any other , with a holy text and saints and martyrs . The Russians see themselves as crusaders in a holy war . ( blows whistle ) Drop : Is there any reason you 're not under your desk , Jack ? - I don 't see the point . - The point is to be ready . In the event of a nuclear attack on the Great Falls Air Force Base , which is the only military target within 500 miles , the initial blast would be jarring , but it wouldn 't even break our windows . You don 't take the threat of nuclear attack seriously then ? On the contrary , sir . I believe that within three days of an initial attack , 3 / 4 of the world would 've been destroyed . I don 't see the point of hiding from that kind of destruction under a desk . Everybody back in your seats . SPORTS ANNOUNCER : Tle Yankees lead one to notling . tle bottomm of tle nintl .

She said you got a job as close as you were legally allowed . She wanted him to come over and tell you to go someplace else . Well , he did . You grew up . I 've been reading these books about how the government knows about flying saucers . They 're afraid if they tell us , there 'll be panic . They started taking you again . It says in there where it 's mostly the Air Force that knows about them . So what I was thinking ... I mean , you were a pilot and all . Why don 't we go tell them ? Yeah . Why don 't we ? ( military cadence ) I 'm sorry . We got some kind of exercise just started . It 's got the whole base turned upside down . Captain . Real pleasure to meet you . My mum said my dad always spoke very highly of you . He was the best bombardier I ever saw . I don 't think he ever missed . He was a good friend of mine . How 's your mother doing ? - She 's doing fine . - Good . You speak to her , let her know I sent my best . Sure will . You going to join the service like your dad ? I might , sir . It 's a good life . Well , you said on the phone there was something I could help you with . Flying saucers . I 'm sorry ? My father and I have both seen them . We 've both been inside them . You 've both seen them ? Uh ... okay . Uh , well ... let me just ... ( clears throat ) get this all on record for you , then .

The people who aren 't involved are all going to be like Lieutenant Wylie . They 'll smile politely and think we 're crazy . So how do we get to the people who are involved ? I just don 't know if they can do anything for us , Jesse . # Just let youn love sunnound len # Hey ... I will do whatever it takes to help you .

Get a napkin for his mouth : Something so he won 't bite his tongue off . Help me roll him on his side so he doesn 't choke if he vomits . Call an ambulance . Tell them this man is having a grand mal seizure . I 'm a med student at U of U. I know what I 'm talking about . Do it now : ( Russell grunts ) It 's all right , sir . You 're gonna be all right . An ambulance is on the way . Dad ? You 're in the infirmary at the Air Force base . You had a seizure at the diner , and they brought you here . Guess there are some benefits to being a vet . I had this headache ... and there were gunshots . Yeah . Are you all right ? Yeah , they weren 't shooting at me . Those ... those two coloured guys that came in , did they get hurt ? Nobody got hurt . You think the seizures had anything to do with our friends ? Could be . ( chuckles ) It could also be the end result of all those fifths of vodka I hit myself in the head with every night for eight years . Captain Keys , how are you feeling ? Why don 't you tell me , doc ? This kind of thing ever happen to you before ? Yeah , once . I was home , and next thing I knew , it was two hours later , and I 'd sort of rearranged the furniture . Headaches are pretty constant , though . I 'd like to take you down to x-ray , see if we can find anything . You need to lie very still . Try not to move .

It 's in the frontal lobe of your brain . It 's very , very small , but it appears to be putting pressure on your brain in unusual ways . Can you take it out ? ( sighs ) So what happens ? I 've never seen anything quite like this on an x-ray before . You might live a long and happy life , marred only by occasional headaches , perhaps more seizures like the one that brought you in here . Or it might kill you tomorrow . I 'm sorry . JESSE : Doctor ? Can you give me the same test you just gave my dad ? See if I have a tumour in my head , too ? Exactly the same size in exactly the same place . What are the odds ? The nature of the encounter seems to have changed . We have stories of missing time . People are losing several hours of their lives . In a few cases , hypnotherapy has filled in those missing hours , giving us a story of a meeting with little men that is reminiscent of some of my country 's experiments during the war . But these are more than mere meetings . These are , for lack of a better word ... abductions . That 's new . In the past , exposure for more than ten minutes was fatal . So we know they 've learned from their mistakes . Their technology evolves . Something has changed in their agenda . Or if not their overall view , certainly in their , uh , methodology . They are " upping the ante , " I believe you say . - Why now ? - Why not ? - Can we prove this ? - Well , we are working ... I need the most credible of these people . I need evidence that I can drop in Kennedy 's lap before he pulls our plug . What do you have for me ? Well , I went in to get some ice cream , and I saw the light out the kitchen window ... Bam : Refrigerator falls over , plates start flying off the shelves . It was like sitting on the back of a wet dog shaking himself dry . It was the same in the living room . Everything 's falling . The house is shaking . I managed to crawl back in through the kitchen , and ... that 's pretty much it . Next thing Susan and I know , we 're back on the couch and it 's 2.00 in the morning . That 's 3 1 / 2 hours we lost . I 'd like to try to get those 3 1 / 2 hours back for you . - This is wonderful coffee . - SUSAN : Oh , thank you . They 're not coming back for these people . Call it a gut instinct , whatever you like . They 're one-timers , like when a fisherman throws back the little ones . What you have to find me are the keepers , and you have to find them yesterday . ( urinates ) ( sighs ) I know I 've threatened you both in the past with reassignment and with worse , and I 'm sure I don 't need to tell you how hard it 'll be for all of us to go back to a conventional military life if the president chooses to shut us down . But at least for me , there 's the comfort that I will have a rank , a position , and a place to go . When I took over this operation from my wife 's father , I made certain provisions for all the men who were assigned to me . Your names , ranks , and serial numbers no longer exist in any personnel file or other military record . You are , in effect , non-people . Without this organization , I 'm afraid you 'll find yourself hard-pressed to have a life . I 've said this before , Marty , but that is one nasty bastard . What are we going to do ? You remember Jacob Clarke ? The only person I 've ever heard of that scared the colonel . Too bad he 's dead . What if he isn 't ? His brother left for Montana the day after the fire in his mother 's shed . He had no business dealings there , no known friends , nothing . Maybe he likes to ski . Maybe . But let 's just say Jacob Clarke is still alive . Wouldn 't you like to know what it is about him that scares the colonel so badly ? Well , Becky , he turns out to be a colonel in intelligence . Owen Crawford . He 's the head of a classified operation that has something to do with unidentified flying objects . - Flying saucers ? - Uh-huh . Remember those guys ? This is what you 've been doing ? All those weekend trips , you 've been spying on these guys ? The last 3 1 / 2 years . You could get locked up for this , Tom . - They do that . - Only if they can catch me . Listen , Becky ... Whatever else may have happened to Mum , this guy broke her heart . My life is not gonna be complete until I ruin his . It 's as simple as that for me . In this year alone , we have put two men , John Glenn and Scott Carpenter , into orbit , and the Telstar Satellite has successfully telecast from outer space . Your world is different than the world of your parents and teachers in ways that none of us can yet fully imagine . Dr Greenspan . Sorry to bother you . Please go on with your class . Thank you . - Jacob ? - Yes ? Do you mind staying under there a while longer ? I 'm not sure I convinced our friends that you were already gone . Dr Greenspan ? Yes , dear ? Those men are following us . What do you want me to do ? Go a little bit farther . Don 't worry . I won 't let them hurt you . U.S. 12 West . If she hits 87 and goes north , she 'll be heading for Canada . I hate driving in the dark . It makes me nervous . If she goes south ... she could be heading for Billings . What if we hit a deer or go off the road ? It 's really dark . L ... I have an astigmatism , you know . My night vision is not to be trusted . Do you want me to drive , Marty ? How 's youn night vision ? Pull up alongside the car ... so I can shoot her . The kid won 't get hurt . Here they come . Okay , on three , stop the car and lay down flat on your seat .

The market was almost out of supplies . I 've never seen the shelves so cleared out . It was so crowded . I got everything I could . You 're expecting a world war ? You heard the president 's speech . Don 't give me that smirk , Colonel . Just because you 're in charge of the little green men project doesn 't mean you know all the secrets . Did you know that boys ? You 're daddy 's big , important , secret job is to figure out if we 're being attacked by Martians . You 're drunk , Anne . You shouldn 't take the car out when you 're drunk . He stole that job from my father . I don 't know how you did that . Took my daddy 's job . Get these groceries in the house . Now . You should really be more careful about what you say in front of the children , Anne . ( Bob Dylan sings Man of Constant Sonnow ) # I amm a mman of constant sonnow # - The guy ought to get a haircut . - I think he looks serious . Seriously stupid . And this song has no beat . I don 't think it 's supposed to have a beat . Boys , you must be done with all your homework . We just wanted to listen to some music first . You always could do your work at the last minute , but you 're setting a bad example for your big brother . Don 't look so bent out of shape . You 're not the straight-A student who can afford to spend an evening by the record player . I finished my homework at the library , sir . I guess that 's easier than having your mother spill her drink all over it . You guys worried about this missile crisis ? ERIC : I figure if there was going to be a war , you 'd know about it . You guys worried about your mother ? People dig their own graves , boys . That 's something you 'd do well to remember . These are her problems she 's dealing with , not yours . You 're my sons . I 'm gonna take care of you both . - You don 't need to worry about that . - Is it true ? Are you really in charge of some UFO project ? ( song continues ) No . Absolutely not . # Ool . In tlis old wonld I 'mm a-bound to nammble # You guys have the number of my private phone at the office ? I need to go in for a while this afternoon , see what I can find out about this crisis . If anything around here gets out of hand , I want one of you to call me , all right ? It 's kind of catchy . Colonel Crawford ? My name is Jesse Keys . My father 's name is Russell Keys . He was a pilot over in Germany in the Second World War . He and I have both had encounters with unidentified flying objects . We 've both been inside them . They 've come for us , they 've taken us , and they 're going to come for us again . Get in the car . Yes , sir . ( engine turns ) ALLIE : You know in cantoons . tle way sommeone can nun off a cliff and tley 'ne fine . tley don 't fall until tley look down ? My mmumm always said tlat was tie secnet of life . Neven look down . But it 's mmone tlan tlat . It 's not just about not looking . It 's about not even nealizing tlat you 'ne in tle mmiddle of tle ain and you don 't know low to fly . Whatever they did to me ... Killed all the members of my crew . I don 't know why it didn 't kill me . I tried to run from it , but ... Then they started taking Jesse . They seem more interested ... In him now than in me . You 're talking about the tumours ? They are not tumours . They are something that they put in our heads . Possibly . It 's a shame we can 't take a closer look . The doctors tell me they 're lodged in an inoperable spot . If someone put them in , then someone ought to be able to take them out . We could take them out , son , but it would kill you . ( chuckles ) You have a very brave son ... to be willing to go head-on at danger , to fly blind . You should be proud of him . It 's not like they left us much of a choice . Still , you 're a very brave young man . A little foolish , but very brave . You go right at a thing . The initiative , for example , with which you found me . We are , for reasons I 'm sure you both can imagine , a highly sensitive and secret group . People are as worked up as they are right now over a couple of Russian missiles in Cuba , imagine how they 'd react to a sky full of flying saucers . And so we have officers out in the field . Their cover is as regular military officers , but their real job is to screen the stories that come to us , separate the wheat from the chaff . You mean Lieutenant Wylie works for you ? Wylie . Yes , he 's one of ours . Your son did the right thing by coming to us . We can help you . What do you make of this ? You are familiar with the work Dr Watson and Crick are doing now , for which they won the Nobel Prize ? - Yeah . Genetics , yeah . - That 's what this is about . Traits that run in families . Our friends are looking for something . In the Keys family , they have found at least some part of whatever it is they 're looking for . And the tumours ? Perhaps it is some unfortunate by-product of being taken into an alien environment , or perhaps it is something that 's put there for a purpose . It could be , for example , something as simple as a tracking device that allows them to know where the test subjects that are most important to them are . - We should find out more . - Definitely . ( klaxon sounds ) Where are Erickson and Bowen ? Any word ? I haven 't been able to ascertain that , sir . You don 't have much of a future . Anyone ever tell you that ? What 's happening here ? We 've just been put on Defcon 2 , sir . We 're preparing for attack . I knew that lvy League idiot Kennedy was gonna cause trouble . I would have bet you dollars to donuts . You feel good now ? Are you rested ? Well-fed ? Never better . You want to tell me why you were sitting in the middle of nowhere , staring into space ? We were looking for the northern lights . You can 't see the northern lights this time of year . We were misinformed . What the hell 's going on here ? You know about Cuba ? Is that why you guys are up here ? HOWARD : I didn 't say that . - You ever play football ? - TROOPER : Sure . You send your man deep , defence moves to cover him , a hole opens up , you just walk right on through . You think the Russians are coming through the back door here ? Is that what you 're saying ? I 'm not saying a thing . Just asking if you ever played football . None of this explains what the two of you were doing staring out your windshield at nothing . Nope . It doesn 't , does it ? You all right ? What did that kid do to us ? I think we got a little taste of why Colonel Crawford was so afraid of him . ( engine turns over ) ( engine turns off ) Jacob 's in the backseat . We were followed . Jacob stopped them . Jacob did ? Is he all right ? He 's in a lot better shape than they are . Jake ? Hi . He 's a very special boy . Take care of him . Hey , Jake . ( soldiers chattering ) You 've seen them , haven 't you ? Mr Keys , should you be up and around ? I saw it in your eyes . You 've seen them . Can I fix you a drink ? I 'm here to make sure you don 't hurt my son . Hurt your son ? You want the things they put in our heads . You can have mine . Take it out . Do whatever you have to do . But it ends there , and I want your word ... You 'll never do anything to my son . Yes . I 've seen them . I would think you 'd be more concerned with what tley might do to Jesse than with anything that could happen because of us . I don 't know how to stop them . But you think I need stopping , and you think you can do that , Mr Keys . We would never do anything to harm a private citizen . We would never do anything to a citizen against his will . I personally would never do anything to harm a child : - How old is Jesse ? - 16 . - Okay , a young man , then . - Do we have a deal ? In the war , you enlisted in the Air Corps , am I right ? Thank you for volunteering to help your country again . Mum ? Yeah , I 'm all right . Mum , I 'm with Dad . He didn 't take me , Mum . I went to see him . It was my idea . I don 't know when I 'll be back . Mum , I love you . I 'll be all right . I gotta go . You got too much trust for people , kid . That 's your problem . That 's the boy . I saw the lieutenant here give him specific figures ... numbers , types of planes , payloads . At the time , I didn 't realize what they were doing , but when the Defcon order came through ... You tricked me . You were supposed to help us . You tricked me . - Kind of young to be a spy . - JESSE : Spy ? What the hell are you talking about ? You were supposed to help me and my father : What about the flying saucers ? What about the UFOs ? Must be hopped up on something to give him the nerve to do what he tried to do . I just pray he didn 't manage to deliver his information . I 'll notify the Pentagon , let them know we may have a breach . Where 's my father ? I want to see my father : You look at three things on the commodities page , like the price of poultry , cottonseed oil , and tin . This is what I did , and all three of them are stable . And this is how you tell there isn 't gonna be a war ? What do they serve you in the army ? Chicken . What does that chicken come out of ? A tin can . - What is that chicken sitting in ? - Cottonseed oil . Yeah , all right , so in a war situation , you have more soldiers ... HENDERSON : Eating more canned chicken . My point exactly . - That doesn 't wash . - Of course it washes . What the hell , it doesn 't wash ? This is the nuclear age . They drop a bomb , nobody 's eating anything . End of story . What do you think ? Is this the nuclear age , or what ? Where 's Colonel Crawford ? Why ... why isn 't he here ? I don 't know a Colonel Crawford . Think this thing will go all night ? 'Cause if we 're still here in daylight , there 's a sweet little Studebaker over there I wouldn 't mind taking a look at . Good evening , Mr Keys . Thank you for letting us take a closer look at that tumour of yours . Where 's Crawford ? Colonel Crawford has an entire operation to oversee . He 's left this particular phase of it in my capable hands . Well , I don 't do anything until I talk to Crawford . I need to know that my son is safe . I might be mistaken , but it does not appear to me that you are in a position here to make demands . Prep him . Aah : You stay away from my boy : DOCTOR : Scalpel . What is it ? Doctor , he 's seizing : What 's going on with the anaesthesia ? SOLDIER : Tin and cottonseed oil . - Tin and cottonseed oil : - DOCTOR : A retractor now : Tin and cottonseed oil : What the hell 's going on here ? Tin and cottonseed oil . I want a puppy for Christmas : Tin and cottonseed oil : ( laughing hysterically ) Tin and cottonseed oil . Alle line eninnenungen kommmmen auf einmmal . Alle line eninnenungen und alle line aengste .

They seem like really nice people . We wish you could come home with us , Jake . Do you still do card tricks ? No . Kinda gave that up after we made you disappear . You gonna be all right ? I just need some rest . I 'll be fine . Well , listen ... try not to ... do anything . We don 't want any stories getting out about you . You don 't have to worry about that . I can 't do that stuff anymore . What do you mean ? Well , I guess it 's kinda like a battery that runs out of charge . I know I didn 't have much left , but ... those men were going to hurt Dr Greenspan . I couldn 't let that happen . You take care , Jake . You , too . We can start with , " Where the hell were you , " and work our way up from there . You told us to bring you a smoking gun . We were following a lead . A schoolteacher in Montana claimed she 'd been taken . And ? Dead end . Just another lonely lady looking for a little attention . I hope you were able to give her some . Well , there were a few stories up there . I wouldn 't mind getting back up there to take another look around . I 'm sure you wouldn 't .

It 's a personal thing . Something going on with Marty ? How do you mean ? He feels to me like someone about to try an end run . Keep an eye on him . I rely on you completely . You 're my eyes and ears out there , Howard . Yes , sir . What happened ? Russians shot down one of our U-2s . Bad time to be a spy , kid . Time of war , they shoot you . - JESSE : What 's this ? - Bomb shelter . - Why ? - Like they 're going to tell me . Hey , did you hear about Henderson and Slide ? They 're escorting a patient from the hospital , some sort of secret surgery . Something went wrong . Big explosion . Everyone 's dead . The patient from the hospital , do you know his name ? Was I talking to you ? Do you know the name of the man they were transporting ? Who was he ? I don 't know his name . Whoever he was , he 's dead .

Part of your inheritance . Your mother and I need to talk . Come on . Out . Out . Come on . ( door closes ) My father told me about this . It 's from that spaceship . What do you mean ? What spaceship ? The one that you and daddy found up at Pine Lodge . He said you used this to take the project away from him . You know , it broke his heart when he lost the program . I think that 's what killed him . Your father had a drinking problem , Anne . He imagined things . What killed him was cirrhosis of the liver . You know that . ( chuckles ) I 'm an intelligence officer , Anne . I 've never had anything to do with any kind of spaceship . You 're lying . You 're a liar : What you 're holding is a piece of an experimental plane the Air Force is working on . I thought I 'd get it mounted it for Sam . He seems to like that sort of thing . Oh , God . Anne , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so single-minded in my work . I don 't ... I don 't give you enough . You or the boys . Remember the first time I took you riding ? You almost fell off . I want it to be like that again for us . It 's the most important thing in the world to me , Anne . Please forgive me . Please say you 'll give me one more chance , okay ? Anne ... Anne , we need to do something about the pills and the liquor . It 's ... You know that . We can 't go on like this . There 's a place in Oregon . It 's very comfortable and very discreet . It 's a six-week program , and I 've made some calls . You can leave tonight . Okay ? It 's best for the boys . And we 'll all be here waiting for you when you get back . Okay ? I 'm sorry . Come here . Howard . Thanks for coming . You can understand I wanted to keep this , you know ... close ? I truly appreciate you doing this for me and for my family . Well , I 'm happy to help out , Colonel . And , uh , slow and easy on the curves . My wife 's in a delicate state , okay ? Anne , Howard 's here . Ma 'am . I 'll take that , sir . You 'll tell the boys I love them ? Yes , I 'll tell them , and I 'll tell them you 're going to be just fine . And when you come home , we 'll go riding again , okay ? Okay .

Sometimes grownups , married grownups , get the idea that they don 't want to be married anymore . And they start to see other people . Something like that has happened with your mother . Do you remember Captain Bowen who worked for me ? Howard , sure . He and your mother have been seeing each other . Apparently , last night , they decided to go away together . They were in Howard 's car , going up over the Sierras . The police don 't know exactly how it happened . It looks as if your mother changed her mind about leaving us . And Howard tried to stop her , and ... Look , sometimes when grownups care about something ... Things can get a little confused . ( voice breaking ) She 's gone , boys . ( sobbing ) I 'm so sorry . She 's gone . She 's go ... She was the sun and the moon to me . I 'm so sorry . ALLIE : I lave tlis idea about wly people do tie tennible tlings tley do .

That 's all we found in the wreckage . Bodies and this film . Russell Keys ' body ? Missing the piece of skull the surgeon cut out , yes . Any sign of the thing they put in his head ? Forensics people tell me there was a tiny hole in Russell Keys ' frontal lobe where this thing could 've been lodged , but , no ... It must 've been destroyed in the fire . After first doing this to a room full of people . Huh . You 're probably wondering why I wasn 't in that room . Over the years , Marty , I 've found that I have good gut , a little twinge that tells me when I might do better to be cautious . One of the luxuries of being in charge , you get a twinge like that , you can have other people take your risks . Marty , I appreciate your loyalty in all this . I 'm not gonna forget you . Now that Howard 's gone , you 're gonna be in a position of much greater responsibility . I hope you 're up to the challenge . Yes , sir . What was he looking for in Montana ? What did he think he could find there that he could use against me ? He thought that Jacob Clarke was still alive . Was he ? No . Are you going to show this film to the president ? No . ( chuckles ) No . No , I don 't think so . Now that he 's saved the world , the son of a bitch is gonna be even more insufferable . You really think he 'll shut us down ? Or make us pencil pushers . - So what do we do ? - We just bide our time . Keep the other one on ice . Jesse Keys ? Yeah . The doctors tell me the thing in his head is identical to the one in his father 's . We just bide our time and keep him on ice . That pretty boy won 't be president forever . These , uh ...

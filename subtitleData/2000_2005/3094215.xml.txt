In 2 hours and 28 minutes ... the 21st Century will be with us . Let 's look back on this last century and make a wish for the new one . I think we 're safe . You sure ? Did you get enough ? I had to stop half way through . Are you in pain ? Not for long . I 'm giving up . How can you say that ? I saw everything I wanted to see ... What will I do without you ? Find another " friend " . That 's easy for you to say . I 'd love to see the ocean again ... Let 's go then . And so we reach the start of a new year full of hopes and dreams . Resistance to new anti-immigration laws turned violent today in Mallepa 's southern district . This area is mostly inhabited by poor Japanese immigrants who have been worst hit by the recent economic downturn . Such frustrations are thought to play a part in today 's demonstrations . Casualties run into the thousands but confirmation is still pending . According to police reports stability has been restored tonight . As a Special Economic Zone , discrimination doesn 't exist .

You walked out on us , on your friends ... your family . Taking the easiest way out . How else to put it ? I was just like them . Chan said , we Taiwanese have to rely on ourselves . I joined him to protect my people . The group that killed Toshi . You went your way . I went mine . That 's all it was . It would 've been easier ... if one of us disappeared .

Hold her hand . You once told me ... how that guy drank your blood . He stopped just before you died ... and turned you into a vampire . I want ... you to turn Yi-Che into a vampire . What the hell are you saying ? Make her like you . So she won 't die . So we can save her . You 're just being selfish . Why ! ? I curse my life . I curse this person who feeds on others . I can 't condemn her to that . At least she 'd live . She wouldn 't die . That 's blessing enough , for me . I 'm a monster ! A monster , you understand ? There 's no way I 'm doing that to her . Hey , Kei . Remember ... the day Toshi died ... it rained like this . " We watched the setting sun . " " A perfect orange glow . " " Both about to cry . " That song Luka taught you ? You remembered . I 'm going to kill Chan . You 're coming too . Let 's have fun like before . Symbolic of the new Mallepa , we 're building subsidized homes . Tidying away this mess , to help our poor people .

Thank you for all you 've done , Kei . Skip the speech . What 's wrong ? It felt like someone was watching me . Leaving early tomorrow ? I can 't see you off but ... I know that . Study hard . Paint great pictures . Take care . Hana ... You forgot this . Thanks . See you . Kei , thank you . I really mean it . It 's a good painting . She 's her mother 's girl . You still mad at me ? You cared for Hana all these years . I 'm not mad . It 's just ... I couldn 't do it . I couldn 't take what I 'd become . Didn 't want her to see me like that . That 's why you didn 't come back ? You 've always been so selfish . Look who 's talking . What about you ... Can I ask you something ? That day , if we 'd made it , would we have done the same to Yi-Che ? I don 't know . But I 'm glad we didn 't . Now . Want to go to the beach ? I 'm so tired . Let me sleep a little . " We watched " " the setting sun . " " A perfect " " orange glow . " " Both " " about to cry .

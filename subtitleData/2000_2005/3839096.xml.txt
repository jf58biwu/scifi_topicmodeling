 Previously on Jake 2.0 : I 'm Jake Foley , tech support . I see you 're still at the NSA . Oh , my god . We got a problem . You see how the nanites have positioned themselves along his central nervous system ? This guy can interface with technology . Every one of his body functions is enhanced . I 've just been authorized to create a special ops team with you at its core . So what 's my cover ? Jake . Sarah . I 'm an undercover agent . That 's hilarious . Mr. Carano has instructed me to ask for $ 5 million as a good faith down payment . That will put you in first position to buy some of the micro semtex . Or ... if you like , all of it . For how much ? $ 20 million . Payable upon delivery . Let 's say you don 't want anyone to suspect that you 're interested in blowing up a particular target . Say ... you don 't want to draw attention to yourself by dropping off a small package or a backpack , that cries out to any security guard with half a brain , " I 'm a bomb . " And finally , let 's say you don 't want to mess with any timers or faulty wires or an ignition switch that 's less than reliable . In that case , this device will prove extremely useful . That 's me . Jake Foley , I 'm in Tech Support . Security Clearance : Low . Very low . Then one day , it all changed . Now , I can do things I 've never dreamed of . I 've been upgraded . I have these powers . Life just got real interesting . Sat ops confirms Agents Foley and Duarte have confiscated weapons . I say again , Operation Canada Goose is complete . You all right ? I 'll live . Yeah , a whole lot of other people will , too . How 'd you know it was this truck ? I interfaced with the driver 's cell phone . My Serbo-Croatian 's pretty minimal , but I thought he said something about his mother 's cheese gun . So in our report , we 'll just say you heard the word " gun . " Ri-i-ight . Let 's go to work . Let 's go . Hey , Jake . Hi , Karen . Your newspapers were starting to pile up , so I thought I 'd take them in while you were away . Oh , yeah , I guess I forgot to stop delivery . - Thank you . Thanks a lot . - So how was the vacation ? Good . Uh , you know , those cruise ships are great for getting away from it all . I thought you went to Yellowstone ? I did ... by way of Panama . You went to Panama and Yellowstone in six days ? There wasn 't much to see in Panama . The main thing is it was relaxing , but I 'm pretty tired right now . Were you in a fight ? Uh , no , no ... I was trying to get something out of my carry-on and you know how they say that you 're luggage shifts in flight ? Well , they 're really not kidding . Kind of big for a carry-on . Well ... good night , Karen . Hey , Sarah , it 's Jake . I guess we 're still playing phone tag . But this time it 's my fault . I was on a cruise to Yellow ... uh ... Panama . Yeah , yellow Panama . It 's on the coast . It 's a little touristy . But , um ... well , that 's pretty much it . So ... you 're it . That was lame . Well , cumbersome maybe . Was that Sarah ? Her machine . In person I 'm even more cumbersome . Hazard of the job . Can 't tell them what you really do . They always feel you have something to hide . Hope you like the single life . It 's what most of us end up with . - That 's good to know . - Come on , we got something . This morning we received word from Filipino Intelligence that Ruben Carano is less than 36 hours from completing a multi-million dollar deal with the terrorist group Soledad , for 100 kilos of compressed Micro Semtex . Soledad - they 're the ones that blew up that nightclub . And two Embassies within the last year . Micro Semtex is ten times more powerful than its namesake . An amount the size of a nine-volt battery has a fragmentation pattern of 100 yards . It 's on the United States list of banned weapons . - So where 's Carano now ? - We don 't know . He 's wanted in nine countries for illegal weapons sales . That includes chemical . This guy will sell anything to anyone . And he 's very shrewd about his movements . He 's only been spotted once in the last three years - by Interpol in Vienna . Carano stays out of sight and makes the deals with his right-hand man - Alonzo Reed . Reed and the Soledad operatives slipped out of the Philippines after their meeting . They could be completing this deal anywhere . What about Carano 's family ? His wife 's deceased . He has two brothers and a daughter - all civilians . Let 's put our overseas agents on alert . This is an opportunity to get Carano and the terrorists . Where do you want me on this ? I do speak pretty fair Espanol . Corner of Fourth and Mass . Oh . Carano 's daughter has an art studio at Adams Morgan . Her name 's Theresa . On the off chance that her father attempts to contact her , - we want somebody there . - It 'll be like a stakeout ? You want me to just watch her ? Yeah . Think you can handle it ? Following a girl around for hours ? It 'll be just like college . I 'm kidding about that . I 'm totally kidding . Jake , you can 't have any contact with her . - Understood ? - Yes , understood . Absolutely . Good . No contact . Just like college . Okay . Here we go 0900 hours . Subject is wearing a white tank top . Looks like she 's cleaning a painting . Looks like water she 's using , I don 't know . - It 's kind of behind her . - Jake , just watch her , okay ? Yeah . Right . Copy ... over . Oh , damn . - What now ? - Meter maid . So what ? Just do that nano thing . I can 't . It 's mechanical . Uh , I 'm here . Uh ... um ... I don 't suppose you make change ? Right . Okay , just ... I 'm going to be right back . I got it . Uh ... thank you very much . Thank you . That 's ... you 're very ... good samaritan . You 're welcome . I 'm sorry . Here , let me , uh ... let me pay you back . Don 't worry about it . It was 50 cents . No , it was a really nice thing you did . I really feel like I should . - Here . - That 's a twenty . Yeah . Well , the ticket would have been fifty . So I figure you saved me thirty . I am not going to take your last twenty . No , no , it 's okay , really . You can buy yourself some new paints or something . How do you know I paint ? I ... uh ... well , because the paint all over your shirt there , and I know there 's a lot of art studios around here - so , you know , put two and two together , figured you must be an artist . You 're right , sort of . The painting I do is mostly restorations . Oh , restorations , restorations . Wow , that 's ... that 's really interesting , isn 't it ? It is . I mean , when I tell most people what I do , they have no idea . Well , well , most people . Yeah , well , restorations are really important , 'cause they make things ... like new , I 'd guess you 'd say . You have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? Not really , no . Would you like me to show you ? Okay . I think we 've got a problem . See how the light plays on the water ? Yeah . The only way to really get that hue is to crush lupine . Sometimes the most beautiful things are hidden behind years of neglect . You peel away the layers of dirt and grime , and suddenly , there it is : The artist 's true intention . So here I am , talking on and on about myself . What do you do ? Um ... I-I , actually , I 'm ... kind of into restorations , too . - How so ? - I restore computers . " I restore computers " ? I , I , I repair them . I repair , work on them , that kind of stuff . How do you run into the mark after the first hour ? He didn 't try to pick her up , did he ? Sounds like she picked him up . Mostly bluetooth , network and operability , that sort of thing - it 's not really creative like this . Well , coming up with answers to problems , that 's creative . I never really thought of it like that . Maybe you should . By the way , I 'm Theresa Carano . Oh , I 'm ... Alan ... Alan Hergott . - Hergott . - Yeah , it 's an old family name . My great-grandfather , he actually left Prussia and ... brought the name with him , here to America ... long line of Hergotts . So you always this nervous around women ? Uh ... yeah , pretty much . She 's making him nervous . I think it 's time we got " Alan Hergott " out of there . Oh , wow ! Look at this ! This is , uh , still wet . Sorry . It 's okay . It 's not quite done . So , did you always know you wanted to do this ? Pretty much . I was a business graduate at Brown first . International economics . - It was so dull . - Then you transferred to art ? No , I graduated and then switched to art . Bet that didn 't make your family too happy . My father 's a practical guy . Really ? How so ? He didn 't want me to be like the other women in the family , dependent on a man . Yeah , my dad didn 't want me to be dependent on a man , either . Especially him . Oh ! Look at that . That looks dry . It 's one of mine . It 's a self-portrait . Oh ... then ... - I guess that makes you the ... - Self ? Oh ... look at the time . Oh , yeah , I totally forgot I have this meeting with the guys over at TrelCorp . Yeah , they 're still trying to get by with Centrino processors , if you can believe that . Uh ... I guess I better go . Okay . Okay ... well ... thank you for letting me look at all your work . - It 's really amazing . - You 're welcome . You know where to find me , Alan Hergott . What did I say , " Alan " ? You said no contact . But she put money in my meter . - I didn 't want to seem rude ! - Rude . She was being so nice . Okay , all right , I understand that manners aren 't my first priority on a mission , - Kyle ... - Okay ? - It just happened . - Mm-hmm . What , what , what 's that supposed to mean ? Nothing . You know , just seems a little aggressive . You 're a total stranger , she gives you money , invites you up to her apartment on the spur of the moment ... Okay , we weren 't strangers . We had the whole parking meter thing , - we talked about art restoration ... - Uh-huh . Diane , is it so impossible for you to believe that this girl might actually be interested in me ? Hi . We have an unconfirmed sighting of the terrorists in Colombia , possibly heading North , and not a single hit from Carano in the last twelve hours . I 'm sorry . I screwed up . I think Mr. Alan Hergott can help us . My sixth grade teacher ? Oh . Uh , Lou , I don 't know if that 's such a great idea . No , no , no , no , no . It 's a good idea . She likes him . Yes . Jake can get her to trust him . I-I really wouldn 't want to use her like that . Uh , unless , of course , you wanted me to . Let 's get Mr. Hergott a painting . Go , Alan . So , Alan , - hear you 've got a mission . - Yeah . What , you 're totally not excited ? Not excited about lying to this girl . Well , you 're not really lying . It 's part of the job , right ? The part I 'm not very good at . You 're telling me you 've never lied to a girl before ? Never used to . - Alan . - Hey . Hi . Uh , I was wondering if you could help me . The composition 's subtle but strong . The palette seems like it might be good . It looks like it was painted quickly , which isn 't necessarily a bad thing . The plenary painters always strove to get their landscapes done in one sitting . What ? Why 'd they want to get them done in one sitting ? They wanted to capture life , the moment . They didn 't want to put it in a glass jar for study . You see these strokes , how thick the paint is , how bold ? Feel it . Yeah ... it 's bold . Why did you pick this painting ? Uh ... well , it 's ... I like it ' cause it 's open and , um ... simple . Right . And that path , I don 't know where it goes , it 's ... just kind of goes on forever . And , uh ... and the trees , they 're really tall and dense , like you could get lost in there for hours , you know ? Yeah ... I do know . Okay , take off your shirt . - What ? - Yeah ! You 're going to help me restore it . - I am ? - I 'll be back in a sec . I just got to get some new brushes and paints . Okay . - Alan ! - Uh ... yeah ! There 's some beer in the fridge . Okay . You want one ? - Sure ! - Okay . I 'm watching him now . I 'll tell you what he 's doing : He 's poking around the desk looking at some mail . He 's definitely a wrong number . Don 't worry , Carano , I 'll find out who he really is and what he 's really up to . So what exactly am I doing here ? You 're cleaning the surface . That way , when you start painting , you don 't seal in the dirt particles . - When you start painting ... - No , when we start panting . Don 't be afraid to really push . Probably not the first time she said that . This is going nowhere . So your parents live in DC ? They used to . My father travels a lot . My mom died when I was ten . Oh , I 'm sorry . What does your dad do ? I-I don 't mean to pry . No , uh , no . I say he 's an importer-exporter . Oh . My dad 's an arms dealer . Lou , I think he might 've stumbled onto something . Uh ... an arms dealer ? Wow , that 's ... different . Uh ... yeah , pretty different . It 's not something I tell most people . You told me . You 're not most people . I can 't imagine what that must 've been like growing up . It was something . You know , you get old enough , you read things in the newspaper . They can say what they want about him , but he never missed my birthday or a school play or anything else that mattered . So , do you still see a lot of him ? Not as much as I 'd like . We talk on the phone . - He 's out of the country . - Yeah . I can 't keep up with him . He 's always in a different time zone . He sent me these shoes a couple weeks ago . Very nice ! Caracas has the best shoes . - Caracas . - Let 's get our agents over there to circulate Carano 's photo . - So , we just start painting now or ... ? - Nope . You see where these rips were ? You have to let the putty dry overnight . Oh . So then , I guess ... You have to come back tomorrow . Oh ... A man fitting Carano 's description left a private compound in the El Posada neighborhood of Caracas three days ago . Confirmed ? By Venezuelan Intelligence and Miraflores . That 's the presidential palace . I didn 't know we had someone in the presidential palace . Hmm . Yes . The president . We believe Carano boarded a flight on El Centro air under the name Eduardo Garcia . That plane went to Costa Rica . Too late for a welcoming committee ? Long gone . Carano leaves Venezuela for Costa Rica , Soledad is rumored to be heading north into Colombia . Let 's focus our resources here between El Salvador and Costa Rica . I believe Carano 's going to be meeting his buyers somewhere in this vicinity . That 's good work . Thanks . You guys can take it from here ? Don 't you and Carano 's daughter have a date tonight ? A ... a date ? No , no , no . Hey , no , no , it 's not a date , it 's , um ... uh , we 're supposed to work on the painting - around 8 : 00 . I 'll cancel . - No , you won 't . In fact , I 'd like you to go sooner . Are you sure you need me on this ? 'Cause you guys already know they 're in Central America . You have agents all over the place , uh ... She talks to her father on the phone . She told you that herself last night . We 've run traces on her cell , land line - nothing . She 's communicating with him somehow . You want me to find out how . Nice to see you , too . Hi . Sorry . Uh ... it 's just , you look ... amazing . Thank you . Come in . Are you allowed to paint in that dress ? No , we 're not painting tonight . - We 're not ? - No . Uh , the painting still has to dry another day . So I figured that there 's not much else to do but eat and enjoy ourselves . I hope you 're not upset that I tricked you . No , no . I 'm ... delighted . Something smells really good . It 's the chipotle sauce for dipping . Relax , make yourself at home . Okay . I expect you to be honest . Tell me if it 's too spicy . - Wow , that 's perfect . - Yeah ? - Mm . - Good . Let 's dance . No , I don 't really ... Wow ... you 're a natural . You 're really cute when you do that . What ? Wh-when I do what ? You ... scrunch up your forehead 'cause you 're concentrating . - I scrunch ? - Yeah , you do . Right here . He called her twice in the last nine hours . Santa Ana , San Salvador . How do we know it was him ? She has a cell phone on her speed dial , so when the calls came in , it said " Papa . " I 'm uplinking to the satellite now . Put it on the big board . Yeah . The El Cortez hotel , top floor , northeast corner . Got him . Put rotating teams on that hotel . When he moves , we move . Uptown one 's in position . Downtown two , approaching at nine o 'clock . Carano 's on the move . Copy that . He left the El Cortez 20 minutes ago . Is he , uh , is this the handoff ? We 'll find out . - Our guests have arrived . - I copy . Looks like the Colombian posse 's meeting on a boat . You got an I.D. on Carano ? It 's a positive . Our guess is , the semtex is inside the boat . Where are the buyers ? So far they 're a no-show . Maybe this isn 't the handoff . Maybe they 're just transferring the semtex . Doesn 't look like the folks from Soledad are coming to the party . No pressure , boss , but these guys aren 't going to be around forever . If we get Carano , maybe the semtex , that 's two out of three , and we put a stop to it for the time being . No , let 's-let 's wait one more minute . I copy . They 're on the move . - Okay , Peter , let 's draw in the net . - Copy that . Let 's go . Let 's go . NSA ! Drop your weapons . Drop your weapons . Get down ! Get down , Federal Agents ! Vamonos rapido ! Vamonos al bote ! Vamonos ! Peter , what 's going on ? Peter ... what 's happening ? Peter ? Looks like a lot of bodies . Peter ? Peter ? We 've sustained two injuries , both minor . And the Colombians ? Three dead , one wounded . And Carano - what 's Carano 's status ? Carano is dead . Repeat : Carano is dead . Jake , it 's not your fault . Diane , I put the NSA on to him . I broke into her phone logs . I pinpointed his location - right down to his hotel room . - Yeah , because you were doing your job ! You had no control over how this turned out . No , I knew the risks . I knew this might happen . She trusted me , and now her dad 's dead . Hello ? Theresa . Theresa , I 'm so sorry . I always knew someday something like this would happen , you know ? I just can 't believe ... he was shot eleven times . What kind of people do that ? He was shot in the street . I didn 't even get to say good-bye . - You went to see her ? - Yes . - Without authorization ? - Yes . And ? She 's a wreck . The funeral 's on Friday . She 's burying him here in Washington next to her mother . Well , I 'm sorry that a girl 's father had to die , but I am not sorry that a dangerous arms dealer is gone , and you shouldn 't be , either . Is there anything else ? Yes . I want my final report . Everything on Carano for the last six years . Guess you 're going to be here for a while . I 'm Theresa Carano . Theresa ... Are you always this nervous around women ? My dad travels a lot ... my mom died when I was ten ... my dad 's an arms dealer ... I always knew someday something like this would happen ... He was shot eleven times . What kind of people do that ? Is this everything ? Yeah . I 'd like permission to see her again . Permission granted . Hey , come in . You don 't have to do this ... keep checking up on me . - Theresa ... - I have something for you . I finished it . What do you think ? It 's beautiful , but you didn 't have to do that . Yeah , I did . Working on it helped . Helps . Anyway , it 's all yours now . It was the one good thing the last couple of days . Well , two . You being the other . Uh ... Theresa ... uh ... I 'm not good , and I 'm not who you think I am . What ? I just , I ... I think you deserve to know the truth . My real name is Jake Foley , and I don 't repair computers . I 'm an agent with the NSA . The NSA ? Yeah , your father , he 's been selling some very dangerous explosives to a terrorist group . We have agents all over the world looking for him , and I was assigned to follow you . Are you joking ? I used you to help them track him . Uh ... our agents were the ones who tried to arrest him who killed him . Why are you ... why are you telling me this ? 'Cause I care about you . I-I think you deserve better . And ... I couldn 't live with myself if I didn 't . Yeah , well , I 'm glad you can live with yourself now . Are you all right ? Yeah . Never better . The NSA bought it . They 're out of the picture . Tell Soledad they can take delivery tomorrow . You are good , Carano . You 're right . Helps that men are the same everywhere . They always underestimate the woman . Theresa . I 'm sorry . I had to come . I couldn 't let you go through this by yourself . Maybe ... I 'll leave if you want me to . No . Sorry about what happened to your dad . Two and a half years ago , when he really died in Belize ... One of his private planes changed hands . There was a forged bill of sale . He didn 't sell that plane . It crashed . You covered it up . That day we met , thought I was watching you . Turns out , you were watching me ... playing me from the minute you put the quarter in the meter . Got it . Don 't be afraid to push ... Were you always this nervous around women ? I 'll be back ... I 'm guessing you told Alonzo to find out who was . - Don 't worry , Carano . - Why are you telling me this ? And that 's when you really start to shine . My dad 's an arms dealer ... The shoes from Caracas , the PDA out in plain view , all to make us think dad 's still out there , cutting deals . Hey , family business . You make millions running it . Your father 's enemies chase his ghost , and occasionally someone you hire to keep that ghost alive gets shot . Eleven times , to be exact . Turns out your people were there watching that little set-up got back to you faster than the coroner got back to us . You 're very good . You know , I was thinking to myself , if I were you , how would I get that micro semtex back into the country and still keep my $ 20 million ? I think I 'd take it through customs , right along with dear old dead , fake dad . Am I warm ? Kyle , little help . Everyone , weapons on the ground , now ! - Put it down ! - Hands in the air ! Weapons on the ground , now ! Hands in the air . Hands in the air . Get down , get down ! Kyle ! Kyle ? I 'm all right . Get her ! Look ... I make it a rule never to ... do that . Jake ! Hi . What , uh ... whatcha ... what are you doing with that ? Uh ... evidence cleared it . Taking it home . Oh ! It 's nice . - It 'll look nice in your place . - Yeah . Well , it 's my reminder I can 't trust people anymore . I can 't even trust myself you know ? Well , Jake , you can trust people . Wha ... ? Sure . No , look , wait . Wait , wait , wait . Wait , wait . Jake , just listen . Look , I know for the mission and all that , yeah , you can 't trust anyone , but that 's-that 's just your job . I mean , you don 't have to take that home . You just ... you gotta find moments with people that you do trust . You know , and-and people with whom you can be honest , and then it keeps you balanced . You know what I ... mean ? Where are you from , anyway ? Bar Harbor , Maine . What about you ? Akron , Ohio . - Akron , Ohio ! - Yeah . What 's there to do in Akron , Ohio ? - There 's an amusement park . - Yeah ? Yeah . Hello , Sarah . It 's Jake . A friend of mine got me thinking , and I need to be honest with you . I 've known you all this time , and I 've never told you how I feel , how I really feel about you . I like you . I 've always liked you , Sarah , and ... and not just as a friend .

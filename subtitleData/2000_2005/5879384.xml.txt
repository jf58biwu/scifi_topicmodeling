 Spirit . Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point . Answer me one question . Are these the shadows of the things that will be ? Or are they shadows of the things that may be , only ? Spirit . Tell me ! Is this my grave ? What 's it look like , genius ? No , Spirit ! No ! I will live in the past , the present , and the future ! I don 't know what to do . I 'm light as a feather . I 'm happy as an angel . Merry as a schoolboy . Hello , there . Hey . What 's today , my fine fellow ? Today ? Duh , it 's Christmas day . Christmas day . Then I haven 't missed it . The spirits have taken only one night . Hello ! Merry Christmas , ya old fountain . Merry Christmas , shiny X-1 . Merry Christmas , Dr. Orpheus . Merry Christmas , Mr. Venture . Merry Christmas , H.E.L.P.eR. Why didn 't he wish me a merry Christmas ? Nobody wants a Dean-in-the-box ! Oh , thank god . I thought I 'd turned into a complete p * * * * . Yeah , do you people carry the , uh , Joker-mobile ? No ? Huh ? How long ? Still haven 't gotten anything for the boys ? Hank 's covered . I had my old bass restrung and I painted over the zebra stripes . But Dean 's a little ... More feminine ? Well , tougher to shop for . What , didn 't you see the Sears catalog he 's been accidentally leaving all over the house for the past month ? Wishbook 1976 ? Well , I guess the green machine I ordered won 't be showing up anytime soon , either . Are you guys done with the phone ? Oh , did one of you forget this ? It was just lying here . Ho , ho , ho ! You 've reached dial center . Today 's special Christmas story is all about Christmas in Holland . What are you doing , Hank ? Nothing ! Your present 's not in there . What do you mean ? I was just looking for the Christmas videos . Oh , here they are . Miracle on 69 St. Jingle Balls . Frothy the Blowman . Rudolph the Red - Ok , Hank . Listen , I need your help putting up the lights . Ok ? Like holding the staple gun is helping . What are those elves doing to that lady ? They 're dwarves , Hank . Come on . Hey . Baby Jesus is out of the manger . Huh ? Oh . That doesn 't go there til midnight . Venture tradition . That was close . Get out of there , Tiny Joseph . Your work is done . Return to base . We almost lost one of our agents . Granted , his specialty is pretty limited . But he 's an irreplaceable element of my sexy new plan to destroy Dr. Venture . What plan ? It was supposed to be a surprise ... for you . ... for Christmas . Killing your archenemy on Christmas Eve . That 's a gift for me ? Well , I got you some stocking stuffers too . Unbelievable . The selfishness . You hate him too ! Or were you just lying on our first date ? So what 's the big plan ? I 'm glad you asked . Behold ! Tiny Joseph has managed to slip into the Venture Compound and cleverly booby trap it . At the strike of midnight , Dr. Venture will place his precious porcelain baby Christ in its manger , And when he does , it will set off a series of explosions That will deck his halls with boughs of Venture ! What ? That model was supposed to be a surprise . I peeked . Oh , yeah . I know her type . Watch and learn . Ok - 1 . You 're totally gay . 2 . She 's hot and you 're an albino . And 3 . You 're totally gay . You know , I was the first DJ at my college radio station to play the Bauhaus . That 's great . Wow , that makes you , like , 60 or something , huh ? No , just cool . Mistletoe . Dad , I can take care of myself , ya know . I 'm sorry , pumpkin . I trust you to defend your honor . It 's just that ... My pumpkin 's maiden head is not a prize to be- - Dad ! Oh , Orpheus . I wasn 't expecting you to show up . I didn 't think necromancers believed in Christmas . Well , the whole affair is about as real as Kwanzaa or the Wookiees ' Life Day . But I find it charming . - -then the camels ate the straw and left a beautiful toy in its place . That gay albino is hitting on your not-girlfriend . Wait , what ? That 's it ? What does that even mean ? The camels poo toys ? Hello ? Hello ? Well , did you get a good one ? No , and I maxed out Pop 's Diner 's Club card so we can 't call anymore . Well , we can 't just bail on Christmas story time . It 's tradition ! How about Grinch ? Nah . Did it last year . Wait . I know . Dr. Orpheus brought this old book with him . He used it when he was baking those gingerbread cookies , but maybe it 's got some good Christmas stories in it . [ LATIN ] And I can 't go into the details this early in the process , but let 's just say ... [ LATIN ] Oh , dread ! [ LATIN ] Oh , this makes zero sense . I 'm too late . For even now , the beast approaches . What ? Who is this * * * * ? He 's blowing my big thing . Look at that costume ! What the hell is that thing ? I 'm afraid we 're being visited upon by the Krampus . The punitive spirit who once rode side-by-side with St. Nicholas each Christmas Eve . Delivering terrible punishment to wicked children as Claus bestowed his gifts upon the righteous . That 's ridiculous . There 's no such thing as Santa Claus . Not since he was killed by a jet in 1963 , no . Nor has there been a Krampus since the pope cast him into purgatory during Vatican II . But your boys seem to have inadvertently released him from his chambers . Dean did it ! I wanted to read the Grinch . Um , Dad ? What kind of kinky Christmas spirit is that ? It is Germanic in origin . Well , can 't you just , I don 't know , magic it away or something ? No more than you could science it away . No , the beast will not stop until it has punished the wicked in this house . Well , there 's no one wicked- - What the hell ? Oh , for the love of ... Ok , that 's it , Mister . Brock ! Hey , Fancy Pants . I 've been naughty . Come into my house on Christmas ? ! You want some of this ? ! Come on , you piece of Christmas s * * * ! Stay your hand , Mr. Samson . It 's midnight . It 's Christmas day . It 's earthly work is at an end . Doc . Doc ! You were having a nightmare , Doc . So , everything 's ok , then ? Not exactly . We kind of have a situation here . The X-1 crashed , radio 's dead , and we 're in hostile territory . Where ? Bethlehem . Daddy , you 're alive ! Pop , you 're ok ! This is the best Christmas present ever . Hey , Pop . We saw where Jesus was born . And there was , like , magical god-fire shooting out of it and everything . Just like in Ten Commandments . I think we hit a gas main . So , what do we do here , Brock ? Well , that all depends . If the Israelis get here first , we might have a chance . I know some guys in the ... If the PLO shows up , well ... My Arabic 's a little shaky . Not a problem . Did you forget ? This baby runs on pure plutonium . They 're gonna love us ! And that 's what Christmas is all about .

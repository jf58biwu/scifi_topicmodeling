 It 's said the flutter of a butterfly 's wing can cause a typhoon halfway around the world . Chaos Theory . If anyone finds this ... .. it means ... my plan didn 't work and I 'm already dead . Not here ! But if I can go back to the beginning of this ... Evan ! I might ... be able to save her . Evan ! We 'll be late again . When did you ever care about that ? - We 're preparing for Parents ' Night . - Don 't worry , you 've plenty of time . - ls Dad coming ? - You know the answer . Can 't he come for one day ? We 've been over this , it 's too dangerous . Lenny said his dad 's coming . - And Tommy and Kayleigh 's dad . - Okay , I get the point . I 'm not so bad , am I ? Okay , have a great day. I love you . Pick you up later . Got to go . Bye ! - Mrs. Treborn , I need a word . - Can it wait ? I 'm late . You really need to see this . Tommy , leave Lenny alone ! Or I 'll send you to Mr voytek 's office . I wanted to talk to you before the principal . What is it ? I had the children draw what they wanted to be when they grew up . Most drew what their parents did , but this ... I don 't understand . Evan did this ? - Can I keep this drawing ? - Of course . There is one more thing I feel bad even mentioning . What ? When I asked Evan about the drawing , he couldn 't remember doing it . I don 't want to go . I don 't like this place . It 's creepy . I promise I won 't make any bad pictures . It 'll be fine . He just wants to do a couple of tests , that 's all . You 'll like him . You 're doing great . Tell me he hasn 't inherited his father 's illness . I 'm sure the results will be negative . But you can monitor his memory . Anything . A journal . Have him write down everything he does . - What will that do ? - Help jog his memory . See if he remembers anything new the next day . The results will come back and we 'll take it from there . " Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy . I 'll meet their father and see what a real dad is like . " Great , see you soon . What are you doing with that knife ? What happened ? Honey ... What were you doing with that knife ? I don 't remember . Hey ! Hello , little man . Watch your step . - Thanks , George . - No problem . Here 's my number in case there are any problems . Keep an eye on him , ' cause ... You kidding ? We 'll have a great time . Right ? Be good . I love you . Go along. ln the back yard . Here it comes ! Dad bought a new video camera , we 'll be in a movie . That 's right , Evan . And you ... will be the star . - l thought I was . - Hey , what did I tell you ? Now , Evan , you have to promise , your bestest superduper promise , that this will be our little secret . Can you do that ? Where am I ? Where do we all go ? I was just somewhere else ! How did I get here ? Quit acting like a retard or I 'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you 've been . Kayleigh ... What happened ? Good news is the results are negative . I found no evidence of lesions or tumors . You must have something . I 'd say the blackouts are stress related . But he 's 7 years old ! What kind of stress can a 7-year-old have ? Maybe he has coping problems about having no father . Last time it occurred he was visiting a friend 's dad . He has been pushing me to meet his father and I 've been putting it off . It 's worth a shot . We can arrange a meeting . A careful dose of sedatives for Jason . Evan comes in for a quick visit , and hopefully no more missing father complex . April 15th . Today I get to meet my father . His name is Jason and he 's crazy . I hope he lets me call him Dad . - My dad lives here ? - Not in this wing . If your dad seems a little sleepy it 's because of the medicine . It 'll just be a moment . It 's okay , I won 't bite . You 've seen pictures of me , right ? Mom says I have your smile , your hair ... He has to die , it 's the only way ! Jason , stop ! It 's all right . - He 's hurt bad . - Get a stretcher . Let 's get him out of here . .. certain hope that the resurrection to eternal life , we commend to Almighty God our brother Jason . The Lord bless him and keep him . The Lord make His light shine upon him and be gracious unto him and give him peace . Amen . Come on , where is it ? I know it 's here somewhere . Tommy , what 's up already ? - What are you looking for ? - Shut up , lard ass . And you , hold your horses . It 's here somewhere . We should go soon . If Dad catches us , we 're dead . Let 's go . I knew Dad had one . Let 's blow something . Here you go . I 'm not touching this thing . You are . - Then you won 't puss out . - Not this time , buddy . The fuse is small , I 'll get killed . Not necessarily . Here you go. lt 'll buy you two minutes at the least . Thanks , friend . For chrissake , just do it . You got balls , man . Sure took you long enough . What the hell ? Help me get him up . - Evan , help me . - What happened ? Where are we ? What did we do ? Evan , help me ! - Oh my God ! - Let 's go ! - What happened to you ? - He 's fine . Everything 's going to be fine . - Why isn 't he speaking ? - He 's in shock . What is it ? What happened ? We were in the woods and he freaked out . He was okay and then he just froze up . What happened , Evan ? The truth . I don 't know , I don 't remember . Something must have happened . I blacked it out . Don 't use your blackouts to get out of this one . You 're not making it up ? Breathe in . And breathe out . And relax . You are completely asleep . Relaxed . I want you to take me to when you were in the woods with Lenny . Think of it like a movie . You can pause , rewind , or slow down any details you wish . Understand ? Yes . Where are you now ? Standing next to Kayleigh , my hands over her ears . Are you hurting her ? No , I 'm protecting her . Let 's move forward in time . What do you see ? I see a car . Yes , Evan . Tell me about the car . Go on . Nothing can hurt you . Remember ? It 's only a movie . You 're completely safe . I can 't ! The car vanishes and all of a sudden ... I 'm on the ground . The car doesn 't vanish . The movie in your head is broken . - Tell me about the car . - l can 't ! It 's coming . Fight it , Evan ! Hurry , it 's coming . - My God ! - On the count of ten ... You 'll wake feeling refreshed . What are you doing ? What 's happening ? Make it stop ! One ... you 're feeling awake . Two ... your eyes are not as heavy . Five , six ... Come on , wake up ! Nine ! Ten ! What happened ? Did it work ? Thanks , Mom . See you later . Wipe that look off your face or we 'll get busted . See how Evan 's mom looked at you ? Sorry . Will someone tell me what happened with the mailbox ? Don 't ever bring that shit up again ! Not ever ! Let 's go . Are you okay ? Holy shit ! Look at that fat fuck ! He 's got bigger titties than Lenny 's mom . Shut up , faggot ! No one 's talking to you . Sorry , this was a bad idea . You really don 't remember what happened ? You 're so lucky . Look , Lenny will be fine , you 'll see . Sorry . It 's not your fault . Mrs. Kagan called Dad and blamed us . Your dad did that ? - l deserve a lot worse . - What ? You deserve a better family . They make you feel like shit . You don 't know how beautiful you are . What the fuck are you doing ? What the fuck are you doing ? I can 't believe you did that ! Why do you have to be such a dick ? Stop it ! You 're out of here . of a horrible act of vandalism . of criminal mischief gone awry , devastated the community . of dynamite . The police have no leads , no suspects and no motive ... Good night . We 're moving . Why 's Tommy still so pissed at me ? He knows I 'm moving away , right ? He 's been acting real strange lately . He won 't even look me in the eyes . Here they come . Did your mom say if Lenny was okay ? He must be ... I mean they let him out . Welcome home ! Want some fresh air ? - ls Tommy with you ? - No , it 's cool . So what did you do in there ? It 's awful , you can 't sleep because everybody 's screaming all night . I never want to go back . - Do you see that ? - What 's that smoke ? Crockett ! What are you doing to my dog ? - Look what you made me do ! - What 's wrong with you ? Come on , please wake up ! Kiss her , Prince Charming ! How long was I out ? What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . - Aced it . - And time ! Put your pencils down and place your books on my desk before you leave . You too , Mr. Nelson . Everybody ! - How did you do ? - l don 't know . I think I got some stories mixed up . Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog to lick his nuts ? Typical psych major : complete wise ass . How 's your project ? Still planning to change the way we scientists view memory assimilation ? I don 't have a choice . Smells of patchouli and ass in here . Cricket , this is my well-mannered roommate Evan . You fucked up the bell curve on my anthropology final . - Later , Thumper . - Bye . Fucking dick ! - Sweet girl . - l found your shirt . Sick fuck ! Hi , man . Get dressed . - You 're taking me out . - You ace another midterm ? Better than that . 7 years , no blackouts . Yeah , let 's do this ! Yeah ! Be gentle with me ! I 'm post-coital . Did she cradle your balls ? Nice ! Look at him . Get him out of my bar . Which one of you has the pet worm ? Worms , plural ! That 's so gross ! Talk to him about it , it 's his fetish . It 's a psych project , to study our memory loss . Explain it or I 'll have a heart attack . Ten bucks says he eats it off the floor ! If I can figure out how the memory of a worm functions I should understand the complexities ... of the human brain . Let me get this shot . What the fuck ? Well ... I guess that 's your game . Smells like sex in here . Yeah , Thumper had a busy afternoon . You 're kidding ? He 's so big ! Yeah . I guess charisma and eyeliner go a long way . - You want a beer ? - Yeah . You any incense or scented candles ? No ... these are my ... Most guys usually tuck porn under their bed . - You 've got comp books ? - My journals . I 've been keeping them since I was 7 . Read me something . I should get something out of this . Here we go . " lt 's like my mind refuses to believe what I 'm seeing . Hearing Crockett make those awful screams . Just writing about it gives me the shivers . " Come on ... Go on . " lt was like Tommy was possessed or something . There was a hate in his eyes ... Are you okay ? Where am I ? What 's the hell 's going on ? I can 't open it ! Drop it or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep . I got him , save Crockett ! Listen to me good , Evan . Why do you have to fuck with my sister ? It 's okay. lt was just a dream . - lt didn 't feel like a dream . - They never do . So , Don Juan , do you pass out on all your dates ? I 've a surprise for you , guess who 's here ? It 's me . Evan . Are you working on a model ? Look , I see you 're busy ... so ... I 'll try to make this quick . Do you remember that day ... at the junkyard , when we were kids ? I was hoping you 'd help me remember . Just any details ... I couldn 't cut ... The rope . Yeah . That 's good . Anything else ? " Drop it or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep ! " Jesus ... lt really happened . Wow , Lenny ... " Make one peep ... and I swear it 'll be your last , motherfucker ! " The last thing I remember are my hands over Kayleigh 's ears . I was more focused on her hands , on mine ... than on the mailbox ... " Maybe it went out . Shall we check it ? Yeah , you do that , Lenny . Make one peep and it 'll be your last one , motherfucker . How 's my sweet girl ? Do you want to open it ? Lenny , come on ! Lenny , come on ! Let 's go ! Christ , man ! Fucking brutal ! - Hello ? - Mrs. Kagan , it 's Evan . Treborn . how much you upset Lenny . Yeah , I 'm really sorry . to clean up the mess . Can I talk to Lenny ? Don 't call here . Mom ... I 'm just so proud of you . Did ... did Jason get good grades ? He got straight " A " s without touching a book . It was the one area his memory never failed him . Did he ever say that he ... figured out a way to recall his lost memories , years after he blacked them out ? - Why do you ask ? - l just figured with him being such a brain , you 'd think he 'd figure out a way to remember stuff that he forgot . When he was your age , almost exactly your age , he said he 'd figured out a way to remember his past . I couldn 't tell if they were real or imagined . Then just before it got so bad , he ... had to be institutionalized , he said he could ... What ? - What ? What did he do ? - Forget it . It 's nothing . He was far too sick by then . " l never wanted to be in the movie . It was cold , I wanted to wear my clothes . Mr. Miller took my shirt off . " - What are you doing ? - l need quiet for this . Are you stupid or what ? There 's a reason you repressed the day some pervert had you in your undies . I 'd think twice , you could wake up more fucked up than you are now . More fucked up than I am ? You think you know me ? I don 't know me ! Sorry . It was my fault . Can we get through a day without you breaking something ? My God , it 's been a long time ! How 've you been ? - Same old , you know . - No , I don 't know . Fill me in . I 'm going to State now . It 's going good . My mom 's good . - Want a smoke ? - Not since we were kids . I 've quit a hundred times . Are you walking home ? - Can I walk you ? - Sure . - My God ! - So ... How 's Tommy ? Well , they kept him in juvy for a few years , but ... Now he 's working at Dale 's Auto Body . That 's good . - Still living with your dad ? - No . I emancipated myself at 15 . Must have taken a lot of courage . Not if you remember my dad . Couldn 't you have moved in with your mom ? She had a new family , not enough room . I came back to town to talk to you . To me ? Why ? Remember when we were kids and I had those blackouts ? Yeah , of course . Some of those memories have been coming back . I wanted to talk to you about one in particular . I 'll try to remember . When we were kids your dad was making a movie , about Robin Hood or ... What do you want to know ? Did he ... What happened in the basement ? Look , it was a long time ago . is that why you came back here ? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood ? I just think something bad happened . is there a point to this ? Whatever happened , it wasn 't our fault , we were kids . We didn 't do anything to deserve ... Just shut up ! You 're wasting your breath . You can 't hate yourself because your dad 's a twisted freak . Who are you trying to convince ? You 've come to stir up my shit just because you have a bad memory ? Want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you it 's all better ? Fuck you ! Nothing 's all better , nothing ever gets better . You know , if I was so wonderful , why didn 't you call me ? Why did you leave me here to rot ? When he was almost your age , to remember his past . - Some dude left a message for you . - You can smell that miles away . Hi , this is Professor Carter . You didn 't hand in your essay , I was concerned . Call me to schedule a makeup . What did you say to my sister , motherfucker ? for over an hour . She said you came and saw her . She fucking killed herself tonight . She 's dead . So are you . didn 't come out of nowhere , maybe my father wasn 't as crazy as they thought . If I can make scars , can I heal them ? What about Kayleigh 's scars ? " l never wanted to be in the movie . It was cold , so I wanted to wear my clothes . But Mr. Miller ... took my shirt off . " I 've got an idea , we 'll go to the basement . It 'll look more like a dungeon down there . A little light here . I told you to keep the door shut . I want to see . You 'll see the back of my fist if you don 't do what I tell you . Now , in this part of the story , Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian . And they have to kiss and stuff , like the grownups do . So , take off your clothes , Kayleigh . Just like when we take a bath . Don 't make a big deal out of it . You too , Evan . Come on ! We 're making a movie . Put your hands on your ears . What time is it ? It 's time for you to do what I tell you to do . Wrong answer , fuckbag ! This is the moment of your reckoning . You 're going to open up one of two doors , the first door 'll forever traumatize your own flesh and blood . What ... What 's happening ? How are you doing this ? It 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell , whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her pedophile father . Ultimately ... It 'll lead to her suicide . - Nice work , Daddy . - Who are you ? Let 's just say you 're being closely watched , George . Your other option is to treat Kayleigh like a loving father treats his daughter . Sound okay to you , Papa ? Yes . Listen close then , fuckbag ! You screw this up again , I swear I 'll castrate you . What you need to do is discipline your son Tommy , 'cos he 's one sadistic pup . One last thing ... Don 't ever touch me again ! I won 't . Honey , are you all right ? Oh , my God , Evan , you 're bleeding ! Kayleigh ... it 's you ! - Incredible ! - Thanks . Get cleaned up then come back to bed . - Where are my clothes ? - There , silly . The bathroom 's ... Hurry up , I want a quickie before school . What ? Unbelievable . I wish I could get as excited over a nose bleed . Sorry ... I didn 't see you . What ... You 're the girl that ... was with those assholes throwing the popcorn at Thumper . What ? And your name is Gwen . I know you . Seriously , lay off the blow . Don 't freak out when I ask you this ... Do you remember when your dad got that video camera ? Yeah ... he had it the first day and then he gave it away . Why would that freak me out ? I dunno . - Just being weird . - You are such a goofus . So I 'll see you tonight . Good . Andrea , Evan , Chuck aren 't home right now : you know what to do . Hey , Mom ... It 's me . Hey , Chuck . I 'm just calling to say hi . Give me a call back . Do you know what time it is ? Have you lost your Rolex ? Fuck you , frat boy ! Remember there are only two more weeks until your projects are due . About that essay I missed last week , we 're still okay with the extension ? And you are ... ? Evan ... Treborn . The answer 's no . Please take your seat . The exam is about to begin . Settle down , everyone . The exam will begin in one minute . Get off me , asshole ! You guys started that shit ! Evan , you 're hysterical . Did you study for this ? We 'll find out . Me neither . - Are these the answers ? - Damn , Evan . Keep it on the DL . I want to do something special for Kayleigh tomorrow . So , if I said I needed some help from you and the brothers ... I 'd say " Blow me " . Get the pledges to do it . Right . You may begin now . That was so good ! Oh , my God ! Where 'd you learn those new tricks ? What ? It wasn 't ... weird ... was it ? Yeah , if you call multiple orgasms weird . Hello ? Fuck ' em . What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect ? I mean ... Why did you sneak out to visit me ? - After I moved away . - Because I missed you . Did you think my dad could have stopped me ? What was he going to do ? Oh my gosh , my toes are numb . Think we 'll be together for ever ? That is the plan , isn 't it ? Hell or high water . Yeah . Yeah , I was just making sure . Yeah , that 's the plan . All right . All you rushes , you know what you have to do for me . Pledges . We 're pledges , sir . Brother Evan ... sir . Are you kidding me ? What did you say to me ? Give me the Greek alphabet ! Give it to me ! Maybe that 's what it is ! Don 't look at me ! All right ... So , you pledges ... you know what you need to do for me . Take a shower and if anyone gives any trouble , tell them I said it was okay . What ? Shower up , bitch ! Where are you taking me ? I 'm not telling . My God ! It 's beautiful ! Sit down . Thank you . Why are you doing this for me ? When I woke up this morning , I saw your smile . That smile . And I knew ... that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you . I 've looked all over for you . Someone trashed your car . What the ... Who did this ? Who did it ? Probably those Beta fuckers . How can anyone get away with this in front of the frat house ? What 's that ? A dog collar ? Don 't . He may be watching . It 's my fault. I should have told you he was released . It might 've been nice . Like this will do any good . Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun . Don 't even joke ! He 's not going to hurt you ! - He 's just trying to scare you . - He killed my dog . - Don 't you remember ? - lt 's not his fault . You know how bad he had it as a kid . Don 't give me this bad upbringing shit . - You turned outjust fine . - Dad never laid a hand on me . That prick saved it all for Tommy . Okay . We 'll let campus security deal with it . I think I should sleep alone . No , not alone , I 'm staying with you . I don 't want Tommy to see us together right now . I lost you once , I won 't lose you again . What do you mean ? You never lost me . What are you talking about ? You 're acting so weird lately . My carjust got wrecked , I 'm freaked out . Your accent 's changed , you don 't even walk the same . - l walk differently ? - That dinner was so beautiful . But itjust wasn 't you . Can 't I do something nice for you ? Wait . Isn 't that yourjacket ? - Stay away from us , you sick fuck ! - Get this " us " shit ! Like I 'd ever hurt my own sister . You 've done real nice for yourself . You got a nice life . Nice friends , not to mention you 're fucking my sister . Not a bad piece of ass . - Shut up ! - That 's a compliment ! - What are you doing ? - lsn 't the world enough for you ? But you took the only thing that doesn 't think I 'm a piece of shit ! - You know I love you . - No one thinks that . No ? What was it you said ? Sick fuck ? Oh , my God ! Stop it ! You 'll kill him ! He 's a fucking maniac ! Don 't , I beg you ! You ruined Lenny 's life ! You killed Crockett ! You killed that woman and her baby ! Now you want to kill me . My God , what have you done ? Drop the bat ! Come on ! First time ? Yeah . Better not bitch out , man . You 'll wind up someone 's luggage . Can you protect me ? Jesus Himself couldn 't make me stand up against the Brotherhood . Look , man , when they come , you go someplace else in your head . Be somewhere else . Back your ass off . Hey , you ! Give me that ! Ball of shit . I spoke to your lawyer . He 's sure he can get you off on self-defense . So if you 're just patient ... Mom ... - How long will I be in here ? - l don 't know . These things take time . Did you bring me the journals I asked for ? I found these two . The others are still in storage . Mom ! I ... I need them all ! All of them ! I 'll get them to you , you need to concentrate on the case . Please . All right . You 're right . What about Kayleigh ? is she all right ? Try to tell her I 'm sorry . - Time 's up ! - l 'm not going to lose you . Promise me you 'll hang on . Shit on my dick or blood on my knife . Back off ! Show 's over , ladies ! - Get this maggot back to his cell . - Move ! See you later on tonight , little sister . Let 's go ! You 're religious , Carlos . Do you believe in that bit about the Lord works in mysterious ways ? Straight up , man . I think Jesus sent me to your cell for a reason . For you to help me . Shit ! - l knew you were crazy . - l ain 't bullshitting you . - Jesus speaks to me in my dreams . - Oh , yeah ? That 's cool . Great . Pack of smokes says I can prove it . I need you to watch my hands and face closer . You need to see the prison shrink . - Tell me if you see anything weird . - Weirder than this ? If could be marks , scars , anything . " Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing I didn 't do . Mommy won 't let me see it . " No monkey business , Evan . Finish your drawing . Great ! Just imagine what you want to be ! There 's no limits . Mrs. Boswell ! Jesus , it 's a miracle ! Look , it 's stigmata , man . What did you see ? What did it look like ? The signs of the Lord , they came out of nowhere . Man , I thought you were fucking crazy . So now you believe me ? Straight up . Want to make a deal ? Right , look , I 'm new here but I know how things work . You eitherjoin the gang or you 're dead . I ain 'tjoining up with no spics or niggers . And I don 't want to die . So ... What have I gotta do ? I 'm new , I 've got to work my way up . Should I suck your dick now or ... ls your blood pure ? Yes , sir . " We took the woods so we wouldn 't see Tommy . We hadn 't seen the smoke . " Hold them ! " We took the woods so we wouldn 't see Tommy . We hadn 't seen the smoke . " Rot in hell , you fucking animals . Wait , before we ... We need something to cut open the sack . Take this , today 's your day of atonement . I know how guilty you feel about that woman and baby . - Stop it , it 's not the time . - Now 's the only time ! You get a chance to redeem yourself , start all over . - What are you talking about ? - You 're crazy ! If you ever trusted me before , trust me on this one ! Cut the rope . Come on ! - Listen ... - l 'll do whatever you want . I 'll stop seeing Kayleigh , but let Crockett go . If you kill him now , they 'll stick you in juvy . You 'd never leave your sister alone with your father . I said cut the rope . It 's all backwards . Somebody call 91 1 ! Doc ! What 's the damage ? - How much time do I have ? - Cute , Evan . It 's complicated . I 've never seen results like these . Not even with my father ? They didn 't have these tests 20 years ago . What did you find ? The hemorrhaging is coming from here , this part of the cerebral cortex . - Where memories are stored . - Thank you . Never seen it before . Compared to the ones taken last year , we found hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction . What does that mean ? I 've jammed 40 years of memories into my head in the last year . I 've reprogrammed my brain . - That 's the gist ? - Yeah . I 'll go wait in the car . The light is bugging my eyes . Good to see you , doc . It was very ... informative . But I 've got people to see , things to read . See you . It 's me . Can I get you anything ? What about some of those model airplanes you like ? I bet I can get a shitload of them here . You knew the whole time , didn 't you ? When you put ... that shard in my hand ... you knew something big would happen . - Didn 't you ? - Yeah . - l knew . - You should be right here . You should be where l am . " Today I get to meet my father . His name is Jason and he 's crazy . I hope he lets me call him Dad . Are you okay ? You look like you went somewhere else there . Look , Jason , I need you to help me fix what I 've done . I was praying this curse would end with me . But it didn 't . I need information to make it right . - Only you can give it me . - There is no right . You can 't change people without destroying them . Who says you can 't make things better ? You can 't play God , son ! It must end with me . By being here you may be killing your mother . That 's bullshit ! I 'll send you a postcard when I 've made everything perfect . Just get out , did you ? My brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that . I come from a big family . I meant no offense . None taken . - Kayleigh Miller still work here ? - Sorry , I never heard of her . Can 't a guy get some peace in his own house ? Don 't suppose you 're here to sell cookies . Good guess , fuckbag . Remember me ? We had a nice chat once when I was 7 . I have a question for you . Where can I find your daughter ? I thought you were someone else . Make it fast , I 'm expecting someone . It 's good to see you . Can I come in ? If I knew you were coming , I 'd have cleaned the sheets . What do you want ? I needed to see a friendly face . Time is money . I can spare ten minutes for an old friend , right ? So ? How 's tricks ? Sorry ... - Occupational humor . - l got it . You can stop now . Sorry . Does my line of work make you uncomfortable ? Just that you used it to hurt me . I 've been where you 've been . - Where is that ? - You wouldn 't believe me . I know people always say that ... but in this case , it 's not even worth trying . I decided I had to find you . I went to your dad and got him to tell me . The rest you know . - You 're right , I don 't believe you . - l knew it . That 's why I never told a soul and I won 't again . I 'm the only person you 've told ? That 's a great line . Does that make other girls wet ? Do they eat up that bullshit ? I don 't give a shit if you believe me . - And I 'm too tired to prove it . - Oh , there 's proof now , huh ? How would I know you have twin moles on your thigh ? Anyone with 50 bucks can tell you that . Forget that . How about you prefer the smell of skunk to flowers ? That you hate cilantro because for some reason it reminds you of your stepsister ? And when you have an orgasm , your toes go numb . I 'm sure all your clientele know that . I just thought you should know . Know what ? That you were happy once ... with me . There 's one major hole in your story . There 's no way on this planet I would ever be in some fucking sorority . - You were happy there . - Oh , you 're crying . Sure you don 't want your wallet ? - l won 't need it where l 'm going . - To change everybody else 's life ? Maybe next time you 'll pop up in some mansion while I end up in Tijuana doing some donkey act . I 'm over it . Every time I try to help someone , everything goes to shit . Don 't give up now , you 've done so much for me ! Why don 't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby ? Then maybe Lenny wouldn 't freak out and ruin my family . No , go back to when I 'm seven , and fuck me in front of my daddy 's video camera . Straighten me out a bit . You 're on my bed , get out ! I thought it was okay , with you being sick and all . I won 't say it again . " The last thing I remember was my hands over Kayleigh 's ears . I was more focused on her hands ... Stay back , don 't go near the mailbox ! Idiots ! Get back !

Let 's go for a stroll . Tommy 's really into this Jesus freak thing . You know how spiritual he is since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie . He saved them ? He 's a twisted fuck ! Let 's sit here . Want a granola bar ? Here . I 've got to fix these things . Do you ever think about us ? I mean ... Do you ever wonder if things might have been different between us ? Sure , Evan . You were the first person I ever cared about . - l was ? - Yeah . That 's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother . I don 't get it . When my folks split up , they gave us a choice who we wanted to live with . And I couldn 't stand my dad , but I knew if I went with Mom , I 'd never see you again . I didn 't know that . So , you still think about us together ? It 's crossed my mind from time to time . And ? A lot of things have crossed my mind . I could play out the entire movie of our lives . We fall in love , we get married , we have kids . Our kids grow old , as do we . Matching burial plots , the whole thing . It took longer to tell than to imagine . Things like that usually do . Do you think it might have worked ? Yeah . But that 's not how things wound up . I 'm with Lenny . Lenny 's your friend . That 's where it ends . Would it make a difference if I told you no one could love anyone as much as I love you ? I 'm not saying that ... - Yeah . - l ... you know ... I 'm just saying it like ... is it something a girl would want to hear ? Hold on , Lenny 's calling . I 'll be right back . You forgot to put the toaster on the ledge . Lenny likes Pop-Tarts .

I 've got to get you out , visiting-hours are almost over . Mom get transferred again ? What ? She 's always been in here . Lookin ' ... good kiddo . " Lung cancer " . You started chain smoking after my accident . Sorry , he 's acting out of sorts . Mom ... You 're gonna be okay , I can change it . I 'm going to go down to the chapel . You 're ... acting ... just ... like your father . I 'll get you out of here . You won 't hurt anymore , I 'll fix it . - Are you sure you packed it ? - My mom did . She sent everything I ever owned . - This it ? - Yeah - What ? I don 't get you . - Duly noted . - l have to ask you a last favor . - What ? Be quiet now . I have to concentrate to destroy the blockbuster . - What ? - lf l hadn 't blown off my arms ... .. Mom wouldn 't have started smoking . Never mind . Just open it . Turn it . There . " Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy . I 'll meet their father and see what a real dad is like . How do I destroy the blockbuster ? What are you doing with that knife ? That didn 't work . Turn it . Turn it ... there . " l never wanted to be in the movie ... . in this part of the story , Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian .

Don 't be bad or I 'll tell your mother what a little shit you are . I 'll tell child protective services about your kiddie porn . Once step and I 'll shove this up your ass .

Where are my goddamn books ? Books ... My journals . I need them . So ... lf you give them to me , it would help . It hurts me to go through this again . There are no journals . There never were . It 's part of the fantasy world you created to cope with the guilt of killing Kayleigh Miller . Think , Evan . You 've created a disease that does not exist . Alternate universes , with colleges , prisons , and paraplegia . I want my journals , I want them now ! I know you 've got them , give them to me ! You 're not going to hide them from me ! You remind me of your father . He screamed for a photo album he never had . I 'm so sorry . A photo album ? The damage is irreparable . I 'm surprised he still has use of his motor functions . Mom ... did you remember to bring those home movies ? Yeah , they 're right here . Good . Because I 'd really like to watch them . That 's good . It 's best we transfer him to Bellevue tomorrow morning . If anyone finds this , it means that my plan didn 't work . And I 'm already dead . He 's not in his room , search the grounds . If I can somehow go back to the beginning of all of this . I might ... be able ... to save her . Over here ! - What 's your name ? - Kayleigh . This is Evan . Let me in ! Say hi ... go on !

 It belongs to our master ... Nat King Cobra . You suck ! Sorry to have to leave the party early , gentlemen ... not that it hasn 't been a ... blast . Blast . Good one , Race . Hey . Check it out ... skywriting . Where ? Dude . Dude ! Jeez . I never thought I 'd see the day I 'd be working for Professor impossible . Me neither . This is a dream come true . No . I meant 'cause he flunked me in college . Hey , didn 't he flunk you , too ? Squeaked by with a sympathy " D. " My dad died that semester . Hey . What 's my sosh ? How should I know ? He thinks he 's so fantastic . All he does is go on and on about himself and his inventions . Welcome to impossible Industries , gentlemen . I know the journey here was quite long , but I trust you all had a pleasant one . How should we know ? We were blindfolded . Yes . I 'm sorry about that , but since this think tank is a joint effort ... of lmpossible Industries and the government ... the strictest security measures have to be followed at all times . I see you 've already been issued your required " l " suits . Yeah . I notice you 're not wearing one . How silly of me . That 's better . Had a lunch with the National Security Council . So , how do they fit ... Impossibly great , right ? It is the most comfortable thing I 've ever worn . It 's like wearing nothing at all , like a second skin . You 've got a little something brown on your nose . Speaking of skin , you know , the " l " suits ... actually recycle dead skin cells as you shed them ... which then fuel the in-suit air conditioning ... that keeps them a constant comfortable seventy degrees . Yeah . Well , that 's all well and good , but mine fits for crap . My apologies . Here . There . How 's that feel ? Impossibly great . Thanks . They conform to your body 's every contour and every movement ... even my impossible movements . They 're hypoallergenic and help keep the labs ... free from dander and unwanted body hair . Oh , OK , already . Great . Wow . You invented thermal underwear . Whoop-dee-freakin ' - do . So , uh , Professor , with the " l " suits here ... how does one , you know ? Go to the bathroom ? It takes some getting used to ... but now 's the perfect time to start practicing . Um , what ? Mandatory drug testing . Company policy . All you do is think about going to the bathroom ... and the " l " suit does the rest . It works . Incredible . How about that ? I 'm not wearing any underwear . What are we looking for ? Clues , anything out of the ordinary ... besides ... you know , a burnt-out plane full of snake men . Brock , I think I figured out why the plane crashed . There were skeletons driving it ! That 's , uh , nice work , Dean . Boys , we 've got an agent M.I.A. Better come with me while I search the area . No telling whether or not more of these ... snake guys are gonna show up . You mean , go with you on a bona fide spy mission ? Proper ! Let 's go change into spy clothes . He 's gonna fire me . I had a cold last week , and I took cough medicine . What if he finds codeine in my sample ? He 's gonna think I 'm a junkie , fire me . Relax , Billy . You 'll be fine . It 's Venture and his mother 's little helpers that should be worried . Thanks for your concern , White , but I 've got it covered . At least my sons finally proved themselves useful for something . " Company policy , company policy . " Anal retentive weird ... oh ! Oh , my God . Uh , just ... OK . Nice spy clothes , douche . What ? I didn 't have any black . I figured , " cowboy . " Next best thing to spies , right ? Wow ! What can I say ? I 'm like a camel . Uh , Sally . Gentlemen , allow me to introduce my lovely wife Sally . Whatever are you doing out of your room during work hours , honey ? I needed something from the kitchen . Well , all right . I 'll allow it , but , please , next time , just ask me to get it for you . - But you were busy . - Sally . OK , Richard . I 'm sorry , Richard . Oh . And here . Could you be a lark ... and bring the gentlemen 's samples down to the lab for me ? You make your wife stay in her room ? I know how this looks , but Sally has a ... a medical condition . She 's very sensitive to light and shouldn 't be out during the day . Hey , but there aren 't any windows in here . OK . Tour 's over . Let 's get you fellows situated at your work stations , shall we ? D 'oh ! My Kuwahara ! Oh , man . These are no good for you , kid . Beat it , junior . We 're on official government business . Race Bannon . Those bastards killed him ! Those kids ? Damn it ! We let them go ! You know him , Brock ? Worked with him a few times . He was one of the best . Do you need a hug , Brock ? No , Dean . Well ... it 's here if you need it . I know how it is in this line of work . See enough death , and you start to get hard inside . Holy crap ! Samson , is that you ? Yes . I 'm here , Race . Ah , you look nice . Listen ... you ... you have to ... recover the canister . We have it , Race . Tell me what it is . Goliath Serum . Here . Do me a favor , Brock . Anything , old friend . Tell ... J ... Jonny ... I ... Love ... unh ! I didn 't know they ... Yeah . They never show that part on TV . Come on , Venture , think , think , damn it ! You can come up with something . Burning the midnight oil , I see . Well , this looks interesting . What you working on ? Oh , this ? It 's nothing really . Come on . Give us a peek . Actually , it 's quite technical . I am a scientist . Oh ! Hold on ! Sorry , Professor impossible . Listen . I can look at this later . I really just came by to remind you that I need that sample from you A.S.A.P. Company policy . Hi . Oh . I brought you something . Oh . Is that your ... ? No . It 's your ... You might be able to fool Richard , but not me . I have a prescription for those . I need them for my ... You know what I need ? The Goliath Serum developed by Professor Richard impossible ... for use during the Vietnam Conflict , but rejected for production . Injected into a living creature , it alters the subject 's metabolism ... turning it into a living , breathing time bomb within twenty-four hours . The magnitude of the blast is directly proportionate ... to the subject 's size . Why , if one drop ... enough to turn this unsuspecting ant into a six-legged miniature hand grenade ... just imagine the devastation that could be caused ... if , say , an elephant was injected with the Goliath Serum . Now imagine that elephant was performing in the Moscow Circus . Watch out , Ivan ! The serum can enter the bloodstream through the skin ... so direct contact should be avoided . Take care when handling it . If you suspect unintentional exposure , watch for the early warning signs . Does the patient look flushed ? Does the patient have an abnormally large appetite ? What ? Is there popcorn on my face ? Oh , this feels so good . I haven 't laughed like this in years . Richard never lets me drink . Ah , well , he 's probably worried about your medical condition . Medical condition ? He 's worried I 'll embarrass him ... Mr. Big lmportant Science Man , so prim and proper ... all clean-cut and always so damn calm and composed . He 's like a robot . It drives me nuts , but you ... you 're nothing like Richard . You 're alive . Well , uh ... You curse , you sweat , you twitch , you have passion . I 'm dying in this place , Venture . I want to taste real life again . Kiss me , Dr. Venture ! Kiss me ! Please , please , Dr. Venture . Get away from ... oh , God ! Help me . Billy , White , she 's a succubus . Doctor , please . Wait , don 't . Dr. Venture . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! It burns ! It burns ! No ! No ! Oh , god ! What , uh , doing here ? Bad man make Cody cry hurt . I don 't . I wasn 't . I ... Ned , don 't . Dr. Venture is a friend . Bad man make Cody cry hurt . I know . He didn 't mean it , Ned . Ned hurt , too . Heart hurt . Body hurt . I know , Ned . I know . But I don 't want to be a bomb ! Hank ! Hank ! Just calm down . Don 't jump around so much . The movie guy said that doesn 't matter , Brock . He 's not volatile until he reaches stage four . And then what happens ? Then I blow up , right ? Well , not if we kill you first . That stops the metabolic chain reaction lickety-split . What 's this ? What 's happening ? Stage two ... visible blemishes . Not a lot of time . Hank , listen to me . I 'm gonna get you out of this . That 's easy for you to say . You 're not gonna blow up ! Sure we would . According to the movie ... you can take out a whole city . Dude , what is with you ? Why are you so calm about this ? Because , Hank , we 're not just any poor suckers ... we 're the Venture brothers . Our dad 's a supergenius with , like , chemistry stuff . He can fix this , no prob . Dean , we don 't even know where your dad is . He 's sequestered in some secret think tank , and this is , well ... this is kind of out of his league , honestly . We 're all gonna die ! Not necessarily . There 's one man on the planet who might be able to help us . And I know where he is . That 's good , Ned . Thank you . Go back to your room now before Richard sees you out . No more of that , OK ? I 'm sorry . I should have told you . It takes all my concentration to keep myself from turning invisible ... and , well , what with all the drinking ... You can turn invisible ? Just my skin . There was an accident a few years ago . Richard was messing around with one of his God-awful machines ... trying to harness cosmic rays with gamma radiation . My brother Cody was in town . I was giving him and my mentally handicapped cousin Ned a tour ... of the impossible Building in New York , and there was this explosion . I remember when that happened ! But go on . I 'm sorry . You were saying . It did this to me , turned poor Ned into a walking callus . Cody can 't touch oxygen without bursting into flames ... and Richard , as usual , he was the lucky one . Yeah . Superstretchy isn 't so bad by comparison . He keeps us hidden away from his government investors . Ned 's used to that kind of treatment , being a retard ... and poor Cody 's unconscious most of the time ... but it 's been so hard for me . Peaches , are you bothering Dr. Venture ? No , Richard . I just came by for his sample . Splendid . I 'll take that . Well , I guess you 're all done here then , hmm ? Yes , Richard . Good night , Dr. Venture . Mrs. Impossible . Well , let 's hope you do better on this test than you did on your midterms , eh ? What say you and I take a little ride , hmm ? I 've been good to you , haven 't I , Dr. Venture ? What ? I selected you for my think tank , despite the military 's protests ... gave you a chance to do some meaningful work ... and make a little much-needed cash at the same time . What ? I can 't ... I don 't mean to be cross with you , but my point is , I had a few simple rules ... and you broke them . Making a play for my wife is one thing ... but going into restricted areas ... that I can 't abide on a project like this . I 'm glad we 've had this little talk , Dr. Venture . Believe you me , I understand how it is . Being cooped up in a windowless building at the North Pole for an entire month ... it can get to a man , make him do crazy things . No , really . I 'm fine . I mean , it 's only been a couple of days . No , no . That 's what I 'm going to tell them when they ask what happened to you ... and I explain how you got cabin fever and wandered off to die in the snow . Good-bye , Dr. Venture . What ? Wait a minute . If this is about what I saw , I won 't tell anyone . I know . Oh , yeah ? I cheated on my midterms ! Oh , crap . I don 't see why I have to be here . You guys can do this by yourselves . Oh , crap ! Stage three ! Brock , I 've thought a lot about it , and if we can 't get the antidote in time ... and it comes down to it , I ... well , I want you to be the one to kill me . Don 't talk like that , Hank . We 're gonna fi ... - Promise me , Brock ! - OK . - Promise ? - Yes , I promise . - Superswear ? - Yes , Hank . - Hey , Brock ? - Yeah . How would you do it ? You 're asleep . Quick jerk of the neck , never feel a thing . You 've thought about this . Yes , I have . Hey , is that ... Keep moving . Frostbite setting in . Gonna die , gonna die , gonna die . No . Must press on . Great , Venture ! Thousands of square miles of empty Arctic wasteland ... and you somehow manage to step in the one spot of yellow snow . I made you another sample . I , uh , huh ? Come to me , Dr. Venture . Take me , you magnificent beast ! I know how to keep you warm . Here . Put this on . You OK ? I think my foreskin might have just broken off . Wait a minute . Are you a hallucination ? Afraid not , Doc . What ? Did you miss me ? What the hell are you doing here ? Hank 's a bomb . Long story . Richard , please . I can 't live like this anymore . Sally , please be reasonable . Halt . This area is restricted on the authority of the United States Government . I work for the government . Uh , still , you 're not coming in here . Please , Professor , we need your help . Horsewash ! I know you . You 're Venture 's bodyguard . You just want to beat me up . Well , just you try it , mister . Try to beat up a man of living rubber ! Can 't hit what you can 't catch . Stop wiggling around , you jackass ! It 's the Goliath Serum . The kid 's full of it . Good lord . Hiccups ? He 's at stage four . He could go at any minute . Is there an antidote , Professor ? Well , yes . You kill him . Oh , what ? Like that would stop me from shooting ? What 's going on out here ? He 's trying to kill my brother ! The kid 's all hopped up on serum . He 's gonna explode and take all of us with him if I don 't . Well , isn 't there an antidote ? Listen . You got here late , OK ? You 're looking at the antidote ! Professor , no offense , but that 's just crazy . Violence isn 't the answer . This is a think tank . We 're the most powerful minds on the planet . Let 's act like it . Billy 's right . We can create an antidote if we work together . My way 's safer . Bad Richard . No hurt boy . Ned , what are you ... You son of a bitch ! Cody ? Let 's stop this , boys . Outrageous ! Who do you think ... hey ! That 's it , guys . Tie him up good and tight . Well , are we ready , think tank ? It worked ! We 're freakin ' geniuses ! Yay , think tank ! You freaking idiots ! It didn 't work . You people invented ... Ranch dressing . How did you get free ? There 's a reason Ned 's boots have Velcro instead of laces , honey . Clearly the Goliath Serum just doesn 't work on humans . We certainly never tested it on any . I mean , that was the whole point . You send a bug or a dog or something to blow up . You just can 't stand seeing Dr. Venture succeed ... where you failed , can you , Richard ? You 've been on his case since he got here ! Well , guess what , Richard . You lose again ! I 'm with Dr. Venture now ! Excuse me ? Cool ! I 'm not gonna explode anymore , and plus , free invisible Mom ! Go Team Venture ! Hang on . I 'm gonna get my things . - You want to ... - Yeah . Go . You 'll see , Sally . This is just a rough spot . In time , things will go back to the way they ... hmm ? That 's odd . Dr. Venture 's ... pregnant ? That 's good soup .

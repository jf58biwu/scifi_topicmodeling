 Previously on ReGenesis Hira 's dead , David . Yes , she 's dead . Hira took a bullet that 's it . Game over . We move on . You made her feel ashamed . You ! You ... Seen the game the other night ? Yeah , what , Biriliski went through the boards ? Yeah . I think it 's .. - Oh man , you 're not ... - Why ? You think that 's dangerous ? I don 't think . I know . Got a situation developing in the States related to a prion type disease . - Prion ? - Mad cow . - It 's bullshit . - I 'm sorry ? It takes at least 7 years for a prion protein to fuck up the brain ans at least another year after that before you die . She had this disease , something only 60 or 70 year old people get . Old people , you know . Why ? Why did this happen to my baby ? How many people are we talking about ? How many people ate a piece of chicken , an egg , or got a flu shot lately ? 1x05 - The Oldest Virus - This is the guy 's office ? - Apparently . At the time being . Take a seat anywhere kids I 'll be right with you . We 're actually here to meet Harvey Thomas . Oh , um ... Not here yet . - I 'll point him out when he gets here . - Thank you . I guess after Thomas ' lab went bankrupt , the creditors really came after him . - He doesn 't have much left . - Here you go . Thank you . Made him a little gunshy . You hungry ? David , David ! David Sandstrom . Harvey Thomas . Thomas ' laboratories . I was under the impression that you were coming alone . David is our chief scientist , Dr Thomas . He 's the one got us to you . How so ? Well , you 've been working on a prion vaccine , right ? See we detected antibodies to Avian Leukemia Viruses in some human blood . It happens . ALV shows up in a lot of early vaccine cultures . Hey , Harv ' relax . I 'm not here to take away the swimming pool , okay ? All right . As I told Carol here , yes , we were working on a prion vaccine , we had close to 30 million in the project . And then you dropped it ? I had no choice . - Have you ordered breakfast ? - No thanks . We already ... uh . What happened ? We were close . We were very close to coming up with the vaccine . After animal trials , we hit a brick wall . Why ? We couldn 't find any human volunteers . Mad cow . Scared the bejesus out of everybody . We couldn 't pay people to be subjects . - There you go . - Thanks . - Um ... Are you 2 ready .. - Uh .. We 're fine , actually . What happened to the recombinant prions in the viral vectors that you created ? Repossession court . Last asset I had ... The only chance I have of refinancing the lab . - Sandi , could I get . - Can we get a sample ? What for ? We 'd like to compare them to some prion samples we found . Found ? Where do you find prion samples ? In four dead people . What 's up ? The kid from East LA and the most recent victim ... Both ate at Hoppen Chickens . 45 franchises in California and Arizona . Sarah McKinley ate chicken tenders at Lord of the Chicken at least 3 times in the last month . 54 franchises throughout the southeast . Shasco Foods is the wholesaler for both franchises . Well , what about the Texas veggie ? Eggs . Starvest the Market . I 'm on hold with the head office trying to find out the whole sales . - Good going . - Thanks , I 'll owe it to you . Telephony is old school Wes . Shit , did you guys change the internet password again ? Yeah . Carbon . Shasco Foods . Oh .. Number 1 egg distributor in the US . Weston , I think we have a common link . Got it Wes . Thanks . So the victims ate chicken and eggs supplied by Wide Valley Farms . Wes set up a meeting with their head of legal affairs . So where are we going ? I 'm going to see a lawyer in North Platt . You 're going to a flu convention . No .. I should probably skip Chicago and go with ... David , are you gonna skip a Spanish Flu convention to go to Nebraska ? - No . - Yeah . Thanks . What 's this ? We didn 't order anything . Harvey did . Has there ever been a case of avian prions found in humans ? - No . - I see . We 're not talking about avian prion , we 're talking about a human prion in chickens and eggs . And you have proof that our poultry products are contaminated ? You 've read our report on where the victims ate . There are 200 million eggs and 20 million chickens consumed every day in this country . Shasco suggested we start here , because you 're their biggest supplier . We 're in price negotiations . That 's Shasco 's leverage . Four people are dead . I certainly have enough to go public and point a finger at Wide Valley Farm 's chicken . - And you 'd be willing to risk a lawsuit ? - You 're willing to risk a PR nightmare ? What is it you 're asking for ? We 'd like you to hold all shipments until we test your birds and eggs . You 're asking us to put 50,000 people out of work on a hunch ? It 's more than a hunch . You have no authority over the food system . The FDA does . And we 'll be going to the FDA when we have proof . And we 'll comply with whatever the FDA recommends . We 're asking for voluntary compliance now . We 'll provide samples . But until you provide proof that Wide Valley chicken is tainted , we keep shipping our product . Thank you . So this postdoc comes to me with this brilliant theory on target binding , and I knew we 'll screw up ... Maybe 1 % chance of going anywhere , but to not try would have been crazy . And everyone was saying : " Don 't go there . Don 't go there . " What happened ? I told her to go for it . And she listened to me . And she was wrong . You knew she was gonna fail ? There is only 99 % sure . Where is she now ? Med school . - Poor kid . - David ! Hey . Uh .. Thanks for the volatile hydroxyl compounds . What the fuck are you doing here ? I thought you might like a couple of tickets to a hockey game . That .. I 'm playing it tonight . You made the cut . 2 week charm . That 's great , man . Fantastic ! You know ... for an old guy . Fuck you . I 'll buy you a drink . So you know that kid , Arvintchek ? Yeah , with LA ... Kid 's a monster . What 's he like , 6 ' 9 ? Uh hu . Budy checked him out . Called night . * No . I 'm doing good . Good . What ? I 'm playing with this guy Archembault , 32 . Had a heart attack . Is he okay ? - Heart exploded , David . - Jesus .. What are you not telling me , Danny ? I 'm playing with fuckin ' kids who were in diapers when I broke in . A lot of them chewing ' roids since junior high . I gotta take this shit just to fuckin keep the level playing field . What did you take ? I don 't know . Is it the same stuff as Biriliski and Archembault ? - One time , one shot . That 's all it was . - That 's all it takes with synthetic hormones . David , if I can 't play ... This is my life man . This is all I know . All right , give me a sample , okay ? I can 't . I can 't . The fuckin ' guy took off . I don 't know where he is . - What ? Am I gonna ... - I don 't know . - You got a cardiologist ? - Come on , David . Get one . Get on a treadmill , have yourself checked out . I 'm fine . So were Biriliski and Archembault , right ? Order another round . I 'm gonna hit the can . - Hey . - Gentlemen , thank you for the volatile hydroxil compounds . - Hi Hal . - Hey , Jill . How are you ? I 'm well . How are you ? I 'm good , good . Jill Langston , MIT . Calpinder Singh , CALTECH . - Nice to meet you . - Hi . What are you drinkin ' , Jill ? Club soda please . So gentlemen .. I need the abstract on David Sandstrom . I 've been offered a senior position in his lab . Brilliant researcher , arrogant , and has a history of treating his research people like shit . - Ah .. - I know . - He had to see a young postdoc once . - You won 't believe this . Yeah , I just got in . What 's up ? I got a district court judge to cut through Thomas ' creditors . Good . We get a sample ? There weren 't any to get . What are you talking about ? Missing , stolen , hidden , we don 't know . What did Thomas say ? He didn 't say anything . We can 't find him . Caroline , you realize if there are prions in the food chain , and stored samples are missing ... I 'm not here . All right , I 'm coming . I 'm packing heat . All right , all right . What ? Good morning . I 'm Jill Langston . I 'm here for my interview . - Caroline Morrison arranged it ... - No .. Not at 8 o 'clock in the morning . That 's insane . That 's like 7 AM my time . No . That 's 9 AM your time . - I could come back . - No no . Come in , come in . Tell me about yourself , Jill . - You read my CV ? - Nope . Oh . Ah ... Well , I did my undergrad in molecular biology at Princeton . I 'm listening . Ph.D. at Standford in virology with Colly Curie . * - My thesis was on .. - Time ? I beg your pardon ? On time ? Was your thesis on time ? Yes . Mine wasn 't . It was about 18 months late , actually . Wow , sometimes it .. You can go to Stanford or Princeton or any other fuckin ' places . - Doesn 't matter . - Then why are you telling me ? I 'm sorry . - You asked me ... - To tell me about yourself . Your listing off institutions like so many conquests . I 'm looking for a new scientist . Not a name dropper . I published 5 papers this year . Why don 't you read them ? Thomas said that his creditors won 't allow him to release the prions he made until the chapter 11 closes . Did you go to those creditors and explained the situation ? Of course . Apparently they value of their asset is more important than the value of a human life . What is that ? It looks like Wide Valley delivered their samples . So how many of these do we have coming ? 6 birds and a dozen eggs from every operation . 60 of operations . Okay , spines and branch with the highest concentration of the prions we 're looking for . Let 's get as many people on this as possible . What if these guys turn up clean ? Going to have one hell of a barbecue . Wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . Do we know how the prions got in the chickens ? No . But we have a hunch it has something to do with Harvey Thomas . Why ? He 's missing , David . Along with the prion samples he promised us . Well , I thought they were in a repossession court lock up . Yeah , we checked . Nothing . Thank you . The FBI 's been running a profile on him . He travelled to North Platt several times in passed couple months . As in ... Chicken capital of the world North Platt ? Yeah . All right . Well , thanks for the update . Sure . How is your interview with Jill Langston ? Who ? Jill Langston , the virologist I wanted you to meet ? Uhh ... Great . Jill . Great . Went great . We 'd be lucky to get her , David . Yeah well , I 'm not exactly sure she 's interested in the position . You want her ? Do I want her ? Do I want her ... - Okay , get back to me on that one . - Okay . - Uh .. Keep me up on the chickens . - Sure . Goodbye . The most devastating pandemic in history . We know that at least 40 million people died between 1918 and 1919 . And now it was said of the Spanish flu that you felt a little ill at breakfast , went to bed after lunch , and were dead by dinner . The best sample we knew would be found in a victim burried north of the permafrost line . But our field crew failed to find a sample with intact viral RNA . Nevertheless , I was able to sequence the 4th of the 8 segments polymerase . The field samples were taken to .. Thank you , yes . Yes . Please . Jill Langston . Dr. Sandstrom . - It 's great lecture . - Thank you . So how did you sequence polymerase ? Well , that 'll be in the paper I 'm publishing in Nature magazine . You got the sample from a brain . Not a lung . Am I right ? Good guess . It 's how I did it . - You sequenced polymerase ? - 2 years ago . Bullshit . You didn 't publish ? Ah .. it 's worthless unless you got the entire genome . - Well , it 's gonna be a incremental . - Maybe . What would you say if I told you I 've got a lead on a perfect specimen ? Mazeltov ! Jill .. We should be working together on this . Create a vaccine for the old lady , you can 't turn that down . Sure I can . My charms , some you 'll get used to . You 'll get used to my tail lights . Here is a model of the structural of the prion from the Wide Valley chickens , on the right , and from our 4 victims , on the left . That 's a match ? Perfect match . So did we shutdown Wide Valley Farms ? We notified the FDA at 7 : 15 this morning . And the bad news ? In the last 6 weeks , the Sioux City operations shipped 950 thousand pounds of chickens to Shasco , and over 2 million eggs . Where are we on Thomas ? The FBI has him arriving at Chicago at 9 : 15 this morning . Did they get him ? Not yet . And I suppose no news on the missing samples . I have a feeling that when we get Thomas , we get the samples . Let me give you some advice . Ah .. Never take advice . You don 't want to work at NorBAC ? Okay . Cause we don 't ... Offer cash bonuses or stock options , or ... company card that sort of shit . You know . All we offer the smartest team of scientists on the continent , complete intellectual freedom , and the toughest biological problems . Did you rehearse that in front of a mirror ? Yeah . But it 's all true . Wouldn 't I be replacing someone whose been shot ? Yeah . Well , we 'll offer you free life insurance . Why the sudden change of heart ? - Everything I do is sudden . - Well that explains a lot . Explains why I want you to come and work with me . No it doesn 't . I understand you 've been hold up on some little island off the coast of Norway for the last 2 years . Yeah . All that time cuttin' through red tape just to dig up a couple of flu victims from the permafrost ? It was fun . I uh .. I admire . Really , I do . 'cause personally I 'd rather put a bullet in my head than do all that bureaucratic bullshit . How how much of an asshole was I this morning ? You were up there . Excuse me , doctor . - I 'm looking for Carlos Serrano . - He 's out . I 'm suppose to give blood today . Oh , you 're Danny Dexter , the hockey player . Mayko Tran . Oh hey , do you used to uh .. Yeah . Okay , come over here . I can do it for you . Can you get me blood case ? So you uh .. a doctor too ? Ph.D. bioinformatics . Bio what ? I analyze and interpret biomolecular data . It 's where computer science meets biology . That 's my beat . So you and David when he was um ... a kid , right ? Since grade six , yeah . What was he like ? He was a funny , skinny weird little guy who lived day and night like a butterfly . All ... right . That 's it . - Can you hold that ? - Yeah . - Painless . - Uh hu . How is my biomolecular data ? We will tell you tomorrow . I lied . David was not weird or nerdy . He was brilliant . Brilliant at hiding the fact that he was brilliant . And ... I was the only one who really knew him . And I don 't why he chose me . Maybe you 're a good listener . Yeah ... that or I got him a lot of dates . What about you Mayko ? Can I get you a date ? Uh .. No , thank you . Yeah you don 't really need me to do anything , do you ? Okay . I gotta run . I have a hockey practice and you have to analyze and interpret my biomolecular data . Yes . I will dig into your genes right now . - That 's gonna be a handful . - Oh , I 'll manage . Bye . Yeah , hey Carlos . Guess what made the headlines in Chicago . Sam Biriliski died of mitro valve prolapse ( MVP ) . That doesn 't sound right . Any dumb ass team doctor would have picked up MVP during a routine physical . Let me look into it . Yeah . Do it . How are things your way ? Uh .. We 're up to our culo in chickens . Anything yet ? I should get the first test results back tonight . Okay . I 'll call you tomorrow . Hey ! Hey . How goes the career decision making ? It 's very well . Did you make up your mind ? Actually , I was just speaking with your favorite pharmaceutical exec . And we came to terms . He 'll go his way and I 'll go mine . Do you still want me ? I thought everything you did was sudden . Champagne ? Yes . Please . Excuse me . I 'd like to get a bottle of Henry Pan , ' 97 . Actually , have you ever tried Crystal Caleche ? We 'll .. get one of each . Compare . So what made you change your mind ? Well , Caroline Morrison called and raised the offer by 25 % and threw in a company card . When did you get in ? Last night . And you didn 't call ? Well , it was after midnight and I thought you 'd be in bed . I was . You should have called . God , you lookin ' great Caroline . You too Digby . How long are you in town for ? I 'm on a flight tonight , but I thought I 'd touch base with you on the Miranda Virus . - It 's a tough one . - How you doing on the vaccine ? I just got a report here . They were able to grow the Miranda Virus in a 293 cell culture . I 'm an MI-5 agent . Not a scientist , Caroline . What are we talking about here in english ? It means we were successful with step 1 toward a vaccine . But we have about another half dozen steps to go . What have you got ? Well , our baby bomber Jamieson dropped the alias Zanzinger and was tracked to a hotel in Scotland . But um .. Then we lost him . Did you get anything ? His hotel room was clean but then when we took apart the bathroom sink , we found some dental floss . So if you could just see if it 's him . See if the DNA makes him the father of Miranda . We 'll get right on it . So I guess that 's it then . Yeah . Well . Caroline , I think that we should um .. I think we should just work extremely close together on this one . I mean , if anything starts to heat up . If ? They heat up ? You mean , when they heat up . I expect you to make things happen , Digby . Glad to be in about you again Caroline . * You should called last night . - To you . - To you . I 'm hungry . Excuse me . We would like to see a menu , please . I 'm sorry the restaurant is closed . Only way to get food now is to order room service . All right , then . We will order room service and we 'll have it sent here . You 're very clever man . You must be in your room . Apparently the emphasis is on ' room ' and not ' service ' . Doctor . We 're being very unprofessional . We 're gonna be working together . We gotta stop . David . Can 't 2 grown drunk people act like 2 grown drunk people ? Uh hu .. - I hate these conventions . - Yeah , same old shit . - I thought you liked my lecture . - Oh yeah you really smart . And I 'm really fun too . - I know all about you virologist . - Really ? Uh hu . Prove it . Hey . Hi . Ahh .. On your way ? Yeah , I got an early flight . No goodbyes . See you at the lab next week . David . I know . I 'm gonna meet with Mastertech Pharmaceutical . I think ... I know I accepted your offer . Last night complicates things . So ... . I 'm gonna need to think about it . Yeah well , you know , of course . Because Mastertech is a great company and San Francisco is San Francisco . - So can I take a couple of days ? - Sure . And I buy another bottle of champagne next flu convention ? Goodbye David . Goodbye sounded kind of permanent . Missed me already ? - Dr. David Sandstrom ? - Yeah ? You are ? Ah .. Jesus . I uhh .. put some close on . Oh , thank you . Thank you for coming . I didn 't really have much of a choice there , Harv . FBI thinks it 's some kind of a lunatic . They are pretty smart bunch . - I know what I 'm doing . - Okay . I was coming to see you . You see , once I 've found the perfect source to put the prions , I had to do it . You infected the roosters through their food , didn 't you ? Yeah . So they could transmit the prions to their offspring . How often does a rooster go at it , d 'you figure , Harv ? Just curious . I believe 10 to 30 times a day . It 's a lot of infected chickens . Well , sure . That 's why I did it . Can 't fix it ' til it 's broken , is that it ? Yeah . Yeah . You see . Prions , those little tiny proteins can destroy us all . They 're like a virus , a cancer . And I can cure them all . I know how . You want to tell that to the mother of a little girl lying in a slab in Florida ? No . That wasn 't suppose to happen . I was gonna expose the prions in the Wide Valley chicken and then show them I have a cure . You don 't know that , Harvey . You haven 't tested your vaccine in humans yet . Yes , but now they 'll have to let me test it , won 't they . You have the samples , don 't you ? They took them . Didn 't they tell you ? They didn 't tell me anything except you wanted to see me . I was bringing them to you , so you could see it for yourself . You could test them . Oh , I 'd love to have a look at them . And you 'll see , and they 'll have to refinance my study , because I can save them . Sure you can , Harvey . All I needed is a year . 5 tops . That 's all I need . I swear . 5 tops eh ? Well , my guess is they 'll give you 10 ... to life . David , I 'm sorry . Dr. Sandstrom . David . I just don 't think you should call me here . No ma 'am , not right now . I need at least a week or two . I really have to go . I want to talk to you . Hey , David 's back in town . How was the windy city ? Ah .. It was .. You either got laid or arrested . Well , that for me to know and you 'll find out . Here . The missing prion samples , courtesy of the FBI . We need to run those , match ' em to what we 've got . Prosecutions gonna want that eventually . - I 'll get right on it . - Okay . Bob . I have to go . Goodbye . You okay ? Why ? Never mind . You got anything on Danny 's hormones ? - I have . - Let 's go . I just don 't think you should call me here . No ma 'am , not right now . I need at least a week or two . - I really have to go . - I want to talk to you . You don 't understand . This is a government operated lab I 'm in now . I told you I don 't know what they 'll do if they found out . - Miss Richmond , please . - Bob . I have to go . Goodbye . You okay ? Why ? Never mind . You got anything on Danny 's hormones ? - I have . - Let 's go . Mayko found a muscle hormone that 's being developed for * * * in AIDS . The most advanced trials are being done by a Atlanta biotech called Bioxene . I 've heard of them . - Still interested in Biriliski ? - Ya , you talked to his team doctor ? I did . He says he didn 't pick up mitro valve prolapse syndrome because Biriliski was born with a heart * problem * . That 's why he exhibited chest pains , signs of fatigue , dizziness . He said it because professional athletes are used to working through their pain . Ah .. You speak bullshit too . Na , it 's like a second language to me . Did you specifically ask about the doping ? Oh , Biriliski passed every single test the League threw at him . You know about this Bioxene growth hormone ? I 'm working with Bob on it . We got a Bioxene growth hormones structure and we looked for the same thing in Danny . This is what we got . - Something very similar . - Ah .. but different . So the stuff that Danny took is not the Bioxene product ? What 's in his blood is a highly sialilated but mutated version of skeletal muscle growth hormone . So Danny 's cells are producing the skeletal muscle growth hormone but not his natural skeletal muscle growth hormone , right ? - Si . - Yes . Son of a bitch . Has Bioxene been experimenting with gene therapy ? No , but I obviously somebody else has . The muscle growth hormone in Danny had to be concocted in a lab . Instead of injecting something into him that shouldn 't be there , he gets his body to make it . One injection of the DNA and his body makes the hormone . So he 's not cheating . His body is . And even though he has high levels of growth factor no one can say with certainty those levels are the result of doping . Pretty smart huh ? Well , if not Bioxene . Who in the wide world of sports is experimenting with gene doping ? David , if I can 't play . It 's my life man . This is all I know . One shot one time . David . Schuller and Raskin are here . Conference room . Good work boys . We believe Harvey Thomas had access to 2 batches of Crow Grow feed . These batches were sent to 3 out of Wide Valley 60 bird operations . Any roosters were infected by the prions in the feed and they in turn infected the chicken eggs they fertilized . Which is about 10 to 30 offspring a day . No one 's denying that Harvey Thomas came up with a very efficient system to contaminate Wide Valley 's product . NorBAC found human prions in chickens at 2 of the 3 ops . And in the interest of 0 risk to the public , all 3 farms will be depopulated . That 's 6 million birds at a cost of 24 million dollars . That 's a very significant sacrifice in the public welfare . Thank you , congress woman Shuller . What can we do for those who are potentially infected ? There 's nothing we can do . There is no cure . There is one thing . You could fund Harvey Thomas ' research . Let him pick up where he left off . He 's not just ahead of the curve on this . He made the curve . He 's a madman . Who says you have to be sane to be brilliant ? Is that your honest opinion ? I think that we could find sufficient funds to support continuing research . Jesus , that was easy . Harvey should have come to you guys in the first place . All right , then uh .. Is there anything else ? Were there shipments of hens to other farms ? None . Roosters ? Limited . Say again ? Some birds may have been shipped to operations in other states . And you 're not calling those farms ? We 're testing roosters , thousands . And if you find one infected rooster next week what if his offsprings already been shipped ? Let 's not destroy the poultry industry that employs 500000 americans , Dr. Sandstrom . Should the public statement come from us or the FDA ? Surely you understand the ramifications of going public . Chickens could be carrying a fucking death sentence for millions of people . Let 's hold all public remarks until we have determined the potential economic damage to the industry . What ? And I want to move on that as soon as possible . I 'm going public with this and I don 't give a shit what you people think . All right then . Thank you all . What a fuckin ' bitch . Which one ? Take your pick . Well , bitch Shuler is the chair of the congressional committee that funds us . She is also in NorBAC trilateral committee and she hired me . Well , this is awkward . You didn 't tell me . Does someone have to be important for you not swear at them ? Ah .. congress woman Shuller . I was a little out there just now . Well , let 's just chock it up to low blood sugar . What Dr. Sandstrom meant to say is that .. He was speaking for both of us . Because if we 're going to be just another organization that you could trot out when you need us , and otherwise ignore us , you can have my resignation right now . Shall we discuss this in Washington next week ? I think we should . Nice . So these Italian biotech . Genoa Quest , they 've shown that by injecting the gene for skeletal MGH they can increase muscle mass in a mouse by 25 % . So we 're thinking there 's somebdy in the company might pick a few euros on the side . Do a little on the black market , eh ? You think this might be in more than just a couple of hockey players ? - Will you take a pill that will make you better ? - Just shoot the ball , Bob . Okay . Better at what ? At anything . I like myself just the way I am . Thanks . You wouldn 't take a pill that will , I don 't know ... Makes you smarter ? Well , I 'd do that . I 'd take a handful . Bob , you 've already got a IQ of 162 . But wouldn 't you like to see what 's beyond ? I mean , that 's what it 's all about , isn 't it ? Opening new doors . New game . Bob , not if that pill is going to kill you . Say , you are blind . Would you take a pill for 10 years of sight ? Let 's face it . We 're taking pills these days for everything . Make themselves happy , waking up , going to sleep , makin ' your dicks harder , growing ' your hair , blood pressure , pimples . It 's a drug happy brave new world we 're livin ' in . Are you gonna shoot the fuckin ' ball or what ? Okay . Go back to work . I need blood samples and the growth hormone from both Genoa Quest and Bioxene . Let ' put them apart , find out what makes them different . So , Bioxene , Genoa Quest . They 're nearly identical . - Like the amino-acids . - Yeah . Real alike , but different . Look here . The Genoa Quest hormone is missing a few residues from the end terminus . Why are they different ? Where 's Carlos ? Carlos ! We do have an intercom here , you know . What do they gain by the difference ? What were they trying to do ? Hey check this out . The end terminus of the Genoa Quest growth hormone is missing . - A few residues are deleted . - Yeah . But why . I mean , what were they gaining ? They 're not gaining . So they deleted it because ... Because they needed it to be different . I though I might find you here . Hey . Sorry I 'm late . So what information ? Well , the hormone you took is actually an Italian gene therapy . They based it on an American one , but in order to duck a patent infringement they put a little spin on it . And that change did inadvertantly cause the hormone to act on the heart muscle . That 's what causes it to explode . So Biriliski and Archembault died to avoid a patent infringement . Fuck . And because the Italian compound hadn 't been put into human trials , they didn 't detect the side effect . But I think I might be able to reverse the gene therapy in you . What if I don 't want it to stop ? Danny , your ... your body is producing growth hormone 24 / 7 . I mean every day your muscle mass increases . Look you , you don 't know what 's gonna happen to me , David . Well , we know that shit eventually lands on a heart muscle . And Biriliski and Archanbald are any indication . Well , what are you saying ? I 'm saying , no more hockey , Danny . I 'm sorry . I 'll take my chances . What ? I 'll take my chance .. I got a week to prove myself . I 've been waiting for this my whole life . I 'm 35 , David . 35 . No more chances ... You don 't understand . You can 't do it anymore . You will die . Fuck you David . You 're a bigshot scientist . I 'm nobody . I make piss all . I play at shit old towns , I got a fuckin ' Bulgarian defence man who can 't speak english for a roommate , my kid doesn 't talk to me , my marriage is bust . - You didn 't answer my question . - Yes , I did . - I thought you left . - Did . Came back . What 's up ? Want a drink ? Okay . What are you working on ? Bob had a theory . Good one . Died fast . What case ? Friend of mine . Hockey player . Fooling around with synthetic growth hormones . Is he a good friend of yours ? His name 's Danny . His family busted up when we were in high school . Practically lived in our basement for 2 years . Taught me a lot . Like what ? Drinkin ' , women , drugs , sports . Friendship . To friendship . To friendship . - Hey . - Hey . Something smells good . Whatcha making ? - Chicken . - God . What ? What ? ! Dad ! Wow ! - What , what , what were ... - Sorry . It 's a long story . I 'll tell you later . Hey , Dav . Danny , listen , I 'm on a plane back to Desmoines tonight . - Fuck . I got cut . - Oh shit . So uh .. So I 'll see ya . What bad news ? It 's not good . Come on , Danny . Yeah ? Hey man , how you doing ? Good . Good . I got your message . What happened ?

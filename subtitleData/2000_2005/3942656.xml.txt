 Here we go . Just a little more . Just what I 've been looking for . How would you describe it , old boy ? Looks like the Dean of Comparative Religion . Stay the course , Campbell . How old ? Who made it ? From the craftsmanship , it 's a variant of similar figures made 2200 years ago ... by the Grooved Ware people ... from , ah , 6,000 miles away in jolly old England ... - which of course is impossible . - Nonsense , Campbell ! I 'm the Dean of the Antiquities Department , and I say this is evidence of a cultural link ... between the old and the new world ... more than 1700 years before Columbus . Professor Hamilton ! What have you found , my dear ? It isn 't just a cave ! It 's the entrance to a temple ! See ? Look at these veins of crystal ! And these passageways I mean , there 's a whole network of them branching off from this one ! They could go on for miles ! Looks like some local natives ... have sought refuge in here fairly recently . This doesn 't look very native . Made exclusively for Arthur Summerlee . Wasn 't he the botanist on the , uh , the Challenger expedition ? George Challenger ! The madman of Edinburgh ? As I recall , he was ... searching for an unusual plateau in South America . As I recall . He was looking for dinosaurs . A career-ending mistake if ever there was . I 'm much more interested in what 's behind ... that unusual structure . Professor ! Shouldn 't we photograph the wall first ? So we have a record of its construction ? Oh , by all means , Campbell . Go fetch the camera . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Nyby ! Hawke ! What was that ? Perhaps we 've discovered the ghost of George Edward Challenger . Do you think it 's some kind of burial urn ? Open it and see ? It is a burial urn ! Who do you suppose he is ? At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World Professor Hamilton ! What 's the trouble ? - Can we help ? - Don 't go in there . - There was a cave-in ! - Emily ! No , no , Campbell . She 's lost . She never had a chance ! The rest of that passage could collapse at any moment ! You opened that wall ! That 's what caused the cave-in ! There 's nothing I can do ! Now step back ! - Professor Hamilton ! - There she is ! Miss Harper , Miss Harper ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm not sure , we opened the wall . My head . Philistine ! Ruined an archeological treasure and nearly killed Miss Harper ! Get her back to camp ! That might not be the wisest thing . Why is that , professor ? What happened in there ? Nothing . - I ... must be mistaken . - Just like George Challenger , huh ? In an ... another ... moment ... Alice ... was ... through ... the ... glass ... and ... had ... jumped ... - jumped ... - Lightly . lightly ... down ... into ... the ... looking glass room . That 's very good , Finn . We 'll make a reader out of you yet . Let me get this straight . The girl in this story ... she went through a mirror , right ? Into Wonderland . Like your machine brought me here from 100 years in the future . 111 years to be precise . Now you can see why I thought you might like this story . Yeah , but I really am from 100 and whatever years in the future , and this story is just made up ! Yes . But it 's still interesting though , isn 't it ? And it gives us a lot to talk about . How you and Alice might be the same . Not unless this Alice lady goes into Wonderland packing ... some serious weapons ! Alice in Wonderland with weapons ! Come on ! I mean , look at some of these freaks she runs into ! I 'm not saying she needs a machine gun or anything . But an automatic pistol , and couple of knives ... even a crossbow . Now that would make for an interesting story ! Got any books like that ? I believe Marguerite is more familiar with that type of ... popular entertainment . And she and Roxton won 't be back for another two days . I hope they are having more fun than we are . Oh , you can count on that ! I tell you , I didn 't see her , Marguerite ! Of course you did ! You only stepped on her bloody tail ! Come on , move it ! She 's catching up ! Take this . And I thought ants could spoil a picnic . Oh , fine . We 've lost our picnic basket and all of our food . I 'd say the first day of our little holiday is off to a marvelous start . Look on the bright side , - Things can only get better . - It 's hard to imagine how . For example , I could do a little hunting , build a nice hot crackling campfire , and ... we can sleep beneath the stars . Oh , just you and me and a jungle full of ravenous raptors . How could any girl resist that ? Oh , ravenous raptors we can handle , Marguerite . Unfortunately , John , on this plateau , it 's never just raptors . Well ? The language is a novel form of proto-Phonician . And not surprisingly , it 's a warning . Don 't disturb the dead , and that sort of thing . More like , don 't release the dead . Apparently whoever hid the urn in the wall ... thought the poor devil inside would return from the grave and ... resume his murderous ways ? - What murderous ways ? - Ah . Not much in the way of gory details , I 'm afraid . All I can figure out is ... that the dearly departed was a leader of a band of ... well , a band of demons , I think it says . Who committed all manner of unclean crimes in the guise of ... OF ... In the guise of what ? It doesn 't make sense , really . One interpretation of the warning ... is that the demon in the urn can pass from body to body ... as easily as a man draws breath . - Demonic possession . - Superstitious claptrap . No . Not superstitious . A primitive way of describing a real phenomenon . Do you honestly believe that this thing is real ? No , of course not , you fool . But to a primitive people a disease organism might as well be a demon . Something unclean ... that passes from person to person as easily as a breath . What makes you think what happened to Miss Harper ... has anything to do with disease ? When she opened the urn she collapsed in convulsions . She must have been infected . Germs and viruses can lie dormant for centuries . Yes they can . But no disease would affect her so quickly . That 's why you said there was a cave-in ! You wanted us to abandon her , because you thought she was sick . I thought she was infectious , I was thinking of the other members of this expedition . You were thinking of yourself , professor ! - You coward . - I know what this is about . - You 're jealous . - Excuse me . I brought this for Emily . This is not the time or the place , for us to settle our personal differences . We have a colleague in distress . We should do whatever we can to make her comfortable . And how can we do that without knowing what 's wrong with her ? She could have contracted any number of jungle maladies ... before she entered the underground temple . I suggest we administer ... sulphur and keep an eye on the symptoms . In the meantime , the only thing we can be sure of , is that she is not possessed by . Please , help me . Don 't worry , Emily . We 'll do whatever it takes . Do you hear those birds , Marguerite ? Time to rise and shine . I haven 't even been asleep yet . Don 't worry , it wasn 't my idea of sleeping beneath the stars either . Whoo ! Raptors we can handle , Marguerite ! Oh , come on , be fair . There 're at least ... 30 of the devils prowling around here last night . Well , what did you expect ? You threw a picnic basket at them ! Why not just ring the dinner bell ? Oh , for Pete 's sake , Marguerite ! I didn 't do it on purpose ! All I wanted was some time away from ... Challenger and Finn so we could talk and work some things out , that 's all . - Oh , John . I 'm sorry ! - Oh ! My back ! Don 't let that stop you . - You sure ? - Yes . You are without a doubt the most adorable man I 've ever met ! Challenger ? No ! He wouldn 't be so far from the tree house so early in the morning . Oh , dammit ! Who are these people ? And what happened to them ? No ! I won 't let you have it ! You put down those guns . Do it now ! If you 're smart , you 'll leave while you can . We 're not going to let you two kill each other ! If you really want to help , - kill Campbell now ! - No ! Kill him ! He 's the one who 's possessed ! - Possessed ? - We opened a tomb , the demon that was trapped inside can take control of anyone . And it 's got control of Campbell ! No ! It 's got control of him ! He went through camp last night , slaughtered everybody ! Until I 'm the only one left . All right , I 'll make this offer once . You both put down those guns . We 'll sort out whatever the problem is right now . Or you both get shot ... and Marguerite and I will sort it out later . It 's entirely up to you . Marguerite , on the count of three . One ... TWO ! All right ! It 's not in me ! He 's lying ! It 's not in me ! First things first , Let 's take a look at that nasty wound . Stop you fool ! John , what is it ? No , no , no , no ! You can 't go near him ! - Don 't let him touch you ! - Don 't you understand ? The demon ! That 's how it moves from touch alone . It was in Campbell ... but now , it 's in you . So what do you make of their story ? Well , they 're exhausted probably delirious . I certainly can 't believe this entire camp site was destroyed in a single night ! What , you believe in demonic possession ? No , of course not . Oh , good . I just ... You just ? Well , what are we going to do with them , John . Campbell 's leg needs medical treatment . We can 't leave Hamilton alone . And neither of them is in any shape to hike back to the treehouse . Well , a day 's rest might be in order . I know my back could use it . Besides Hamilton says ... that somewhere hidden in all this mess is ... a map they drew of the cave system that led them through to here . A way home . It 's the only part of the story I truly believe . No . It 's the only part I want to . Take it easy , Arthur . Welcome to your new home away from home . Did that kind of bug taste good ? Oh , I 'm sure I would not know . Well , then if you 're not going to eat it , you 're ... going to make something from it ? Medicine , jewelry ? Eat Arthur ! Make something of him ! Good heavens , no ! Well , if you 're squeamish , I mean , I 'll slice it up for you . Doesn 't look like it 'll put up much of a fight . Finn ! That is quite enough ! Arthur is well , he 's ... like part of the family . Which part ? Help me ! Please ! Help me ! That is not Marguerite ! Hey ! Over here ! Help me ! Great Scott ! Is she being pursued ? - She sure thinks she is . - ... is after me ! No , that 's an electric fence ! Don 't touch the fence or you 'll be ... electrocuted . So , shall we invite her in ? Miss Harper , I am stunned ... that an entire archaeological expedition ... could ascend to this plateau without mishap . The only mishap was getting lost in the caves at the base of this plateau . And these caves they brought you out where ? Somewhere in the jungle . I don 't know how far away from here , but I was running all night . Because IT was after you . There were 20 of us on my dig . And when I escaped , there was only me and two others left alive . Because of this dead guy in a jar . It was a demon ! Listen to me ! I 'm supposed to graduate next year ... and become a woman of science and reason . What I saw last night ... what that thing ... what it did to my colleagues and my friends . What else can it be but a demon from hell ? I 've come to understand that on this plateau , the supernatural and the scientific are often two sides of the same coin . We will help you , Miss Harper . Thank you , Professor Challenger , I knew you would . At least they were telling the truth about being exhausted . Umm , No . What 's this ? Turning down coffee ? - Fresh off the plateau . - Not right now . What 's on your mind ? Well as outlandish as their story is , from everything we 've seen on this plateau , we can 't just dismiss it out of hand . Oh , I see . Well , Marguerite , if ... one of them was really possessed by a murderous demon , why wouldn 't they just kill the other ? They had the guns aimed at each other , point-blank . No matter who fired first , they both would have been shot ! And what good is a dead body to a disembodied demon ! You DO believe them . Is that why you wouldn 't take a drink from the canteen after me ? Is that why you don 't want this coffee ? Are you afraid to touch me ? No , of course not . Well , but what , Marguerite ? Am I to think that after all this time , you don 't know who I am ? That you look at me and think I 'm possessed ... - like some kind of monster ? - No , John ! No . You 're the same person you 've always been . I can see it in your eyes . - Oh , damn this plateau ! - It brought us together . Yeah . And it keeps pushing us apart . Only if we let it . Get away from him ! Move ! I will not let this demon live . - There is no demon ! - Not in me there isn 't . And why would any demon want to possess ... a body as weak as Campbell 's . Not when you and your friend here ... so healthy and so strong ! I 'm not even going to count to three . Even that hesitation proves that the demon is not in you . Otherwise a single shot would kill both of us , and make your deception so much easier . Which means I was right all along . The demon is in Lord John Roxton ! - Let him go . - Not before I make sure ... that he can 't infect anyone else . No ! No ! Last chance ! John ! Get down ! Go back to hell where you belong ! Get down ! No , don 't touch me ! Stay away ! There 's no bloody demon . Bravo , bravo ! Damn fine performance ! Oh , no . Miss Krux , that 's not how it goes . You put down the weapon ... or I 'll put down Lord Roxton . Come on . That 's better . Oh , do you see the wonderful possibilities here ? Miss Krux has relinquished the weapon ... in order to prove to me that she 's not the one ... possessed by the demon . None of us is possessed . But you 've all made contact ... direct , skin to skin . So maybe Miss Krux is the one ... and she 's merely thrown her weapon away ... to convince me that the demon is in one of you two ! You 're not making sense , Campbell . Oh , Hamilton , is that you ? Or is that the demon talking ? Which one ? Listen , if the demon was in one of us , wouldn 't he have killed the rest of us ... by now and been done with it ? No , no . I learned the answer to that last night . You see , as powerful as the demon is , he 's only as powerful as the body that he inhabits ... so from what I 've just seen , that makes ... it you , Lord Roxton . Oh , well that 's very clever . So what you 're saying is ... that if three of us combine our might , and attack it with a rock pick or ... shoot it enough times . Yeah , that 's right . Then the demon ... would be trapped in a lifeless body once again . Which is why ... he went through the camp and killed everybody last night , to prevent us from rising up against him . There 's only one way Campbell could know about it . - He 's the demon ! - I 've got the gun . And as the lady said , if it was me I would have shot you all by now . Now that all depends , doesn 't it ? Well , now we are getting interesting . Two scientists , and it 's the hunter who comes up with the theory . Please , tell me , what were you saying ? It all depends ? It all depends , on what a demon from hell ... could possibly want from any of us . Oh . Oh , that 's very perceptive . What could a demon want from us ? Obviously not a band of archaeologists . All right , all right ! Look , none of us have the answers . But you DO still have the rifle . So , what are we supposed to do now ? It 's quite simple , we wait . The demon has been buried for 2200 years . So , whatever it is that he wants , I doubt that he will be patient . Challenger , it 's not that I don 't think you 're ... a genius and everything . That seems only fair . But what if Harper is right ? What if there really is a supernatural ... killer back at her camp ? I mean , why go anywhere near the place ? Because with knowledge comes responsibilities , Finn . What knowledge ? What responsibilities ? Because we know that there might be a murderous entity ... lose upon the plateau , we have a responsibility ... to stop it from killing again . Ah , now I get it . We protect the rest of the people on this plateau , and they pay us protection money ! No , not exactly . Are you saying you help people ... without expecting to be paid ? That 's right . Now I really do feel like I 've stepped through the looking glass . What the hell was that ? This is my new invention . The electromagnetic field distortion detector . It 's a modified mine detector , but with unique improvements to make it much more sensitive . Naturally I 'll have to make adjustments to the acoustic ... feedback settings . This is the ideal thing for finding buried metal well , metal that is conductive at least . Does this have anything to do with going back to that girl 's camp ? Well , if the unknown murderous entity is back at the camp , then this will be perfect for Harper in her archaeological investigations . What 's to investigate ? I mean , everyone in the camp is dead ! People die , Finn ! But there are some things , like science , that live forever . Challenger could figure out how to detect the demon . We 're not leading anyone back to the treehouse for obvious reasons . What was that , Miss Krux ? Did I detect a hint of impatience ? What , after several millennia you 're anxious to get out again ? Why don 't you give it a rest , Campbell . I just thought I heard George Challenger 's name mentioned . Then he is still alive . Absolutely unstoppable . Well , how is Arthur Summerlee ? Actually , we 'd hoped he 'd already made it back to London . Not that I heard . - We found his hat . - What ? Where ? We found his hat in the underground temple where we found the burial urn . Take us there . Take you back to the demon 's lair ? - No chance . - And why not ? Are you afraid we might discover something there ? Something that might help us identify the demon ... find out what it really wants . Seems to me the only person who ... wouldn 't want us to go into that temple would ... be the demon himself . Well , all right . Let 's go . Which is precisely what the demon would do ... if he didn 't want us to know he 's the demon ! Why don 't you lead the way , professor . Hey , Challenger . Ready when you are . Oh , I 'm ready all right , I have everything I need now . John ? It 's Arthur 's all right . Is this the hat he was wearing when he fell off the cliff ? Or the one he lost when that ... baby T-Rex chased him away from the sulphur bed . A Tyrannosaurus Rex ? Only one kind I know of . I might owe Challenger an apology . You ? Apologize ? So I take it that ... this is the scene of the crime ? This is the tomb that Hamilton ... tore apart without proper methodology . A wall 's a wall ! And this urn was behind it ? I wouldn 't touch what 's inside it . That 's how Harper became the first to be possessed . - Harper ? - One of my students . In more ways than one . From Harper the demon jumped into Carpenter ... then Carpenter murdered Nyby and Hawkes , without ... any of us knowing anything was wrong . And then ... And then into everyone , one after the other . Every fight , every punch ... was a chance for it to switch bodies . Well , why keep switching ? Because it 's like archaeologists tearing apart an ancient tomb , He 's jumping from body to body ... searching for something more valuable . There were two of those . They sealed the urn . Iron . Legend has said that iron has power over supernatural beings , but ... There 's something written on it . - Yes . - It 's a warning , Release not the demon within . You can read proto-Phonecian ? - She can read anything . - What else does it say ? Oh , nothing good . Apparently this demon was the leader of a horde of demons . John , you don 't suppose that 's what it 's looking for ... the other demons what if they 're trapped ... in their own burial urns nearby ? Well , how would demons go about finding burial urns of clay . Sealed with bands of iron . I know who the demon is . Why don 't you tell us outside . Stay where you are ! The demon was buried here , and here it shall remain ! You still believe I 'm the demon , Not anymore . Not until I realised it was in Miss Krux . What ? - Put the rifle down . - I 'm afraid I can 't do that . What makes you think it 's in me ? Proto-Phonician languages are my specialty . But even I had trouble translating what was on the band . You read it as though it was your native tongue ! I told you before , Marguerite can speak anything ! The power of language is the demon 's power . No , Hamilton ! No ! I was only trying to save us . So am I. You didn 't have to do that ! Yes , I did . Campbell was the demon . - You couldn 't have know that ! - I suspected it all along . And then ... when he condemned you simply because of your knowledge of linguistics , well ... it was so obviously a smokescreen to ... deflect suspicion from himself . The same argument could be used to explain what you 've just done ! But if I was the demon , would I do this ? No , no , no , It 's quite all right , as long as no one makes direct contact ... with Campbell 's dead body . The demon is trapped in it forever . The nightmare is over . Lord Roxton , Miss Krux ... we 've won . I 'm sorry . I don 't recognize a thing from last night . Until I reached your treehouse , I don 't remember anything clearly . Oh , well , we can 't say we didn 't give it a shot ! No , no , we have to continue in this direction . Challenger , why ? I mean , do you know something she doesn 't ? There are a complex series of caves not ... too far from here , that we haven 't thoroughly explored yet . If these are the same caves that Miss Harper came through , they may be our way off the plateau as well . It won 't hurt to give them a look . Wanna bet . What are you doing ? I haven 't touched Campbell 's body . It 's wrapped in canvas . Just yesterday I thought ... finding this plateau was the luckiest day of my career . Well , you 're not the first . And the way this plateau attracts visitor , you won 't be the last either . Poor Campbell . We were always at odds . He knew I could always best him , but he still comes back for more . What do you mean , you could always best him ? Well , just that . In everything . Academics , published papers ... women . So when you fought him in the temple , he would have known you were going to beat him . - Mm . - If Campbell knew it , - the demon knew it too . - It must have . Then why didn 't the demon jump into you ? I saw you grab him ... you were in contact , skin to skin . But if ... if the demon wasn 't in Campbell , then ... Then you killed an innocent man . This is amazing ! You found it ! This is your camp ? No , that 's over there , passed those trees . But this is the main excavation site . And that 's the cave that leads to the temple where ... Professor Hamilton and I found the urn . And where he released the demon ? Professor ! Don 't go down there ! It 's too dangerous . - This is what I came here for . - Challenger , wait ! I mean , she could be right . There 's nothing in there that I can 't handle . Where I come from , dumb moves ... like this get you captured by slavers ! Don 't be ridiculous . What do I know ? I mean , that guy talks to beetles . Let 's go check out your camp . I 've made a terrible mess of things , haven 't I ? One way or another , we all have . Perhaps now is the time to go back to the treehouse ... and get some rest , Challenger can ... go through your logbooks and reconstruct a route that ... will take us all home . I only wish there was a for what I 've done that ... it was as simple at that . Professor Hamilton ! Emily ! - Finn ! - You 're alive ! Good show ! What are you doing here ? Well this woman showed up with some story about some ... spooky demon killing all her friends , somewhere she couldn 't remember . But ... Challenger brought us straight to the source . Challenger 's here too ? Yeah . He 's back in that cave all keen to use his new invention . Well , which one ? The electro-something field distortion ... something or other . I don 't know . But it 's supposed to be good for finding buried metal . Iron . The demon 's in Challenger ! What ! ? But the only way that 's possible is if the demon jumped ... back into me before I ran from the camp . That 's why the demon kept jumping from body to body . He was looking for someone with particular knowledge , someone who could help it find the rest of its horde ! If anyone has that knowledge , it 's Challenger ! You put down that detector . Or you 'll do what ? You want to possess someone ? - You come into me ! - John , no ! I have miles of passageways to search , before I 'm finished with Challenger . But I 'll keep your offer in mind , Roxton . This is number 8 . 657 to go ... and then we will rule the world again ! Never ! - Oh , you can 't stop me . - Maybe not , But I sure as hell can keep you in this temple ! That 's an intriguing choice of words , Roxton . Maybe I should jump into you . Or maybe into you . Perhaps I just jump back into you again . Hey demon guy ! You know who I am ? I know everything Challenger knows . Good ! Then you know I won 't think twice about putting a ... bolt between your eyes if it means I get to go home safe and sound . Finn , don 't do it You stay out of this ! You 'd be shooting Challenger ! I lived 22 years of my life without Challenger 's help . I think I can spend a few more without him . What do you think you 're doing ? That 's a dumb question for somebody who knows everything Challenger knows , I 've seen this sound shatter glass , so I 'm guessing it 's going to do the same thing ... to whatever is in these cave walls . I should have taken you first ! Anybody who wants to avoid the cave-in , get out now ! - Finn , no ! - I started this ! - No ! - Come into me , damn you ! Jump into me ! - Harper , get back here ! - No one leave ! - Let 's go ! Get out ! - No , I know what to do ! We started this ! You 're right , we started this . And we are the only ones who could stop it . The demon is trapped ! Whichever one it jumps into , the other one won 't let go ! So is this like a regular day for you guys or what ? I suppose it 's fitting , to bury archaeologists in their own excavation . The members of Hamilton 's expedition ... died in the pursuit of knowledge . There can be no higher calling . It 's never easy , Marguerite so much death . I wasn 't thinking of death . It 's just that ... somewhere in the ruins of this camp is a map ... that could have sent us home ! That map , was in Hamilton 's logbook , which is in his backpack , which is buried under a few thousand tons of rock ... and guarded by a demon . Or at least an ... energised life form , hitherto unknown to science . Do you never give it a rest , do you ? So much to learn . So little time . How can I rest . Amen ! Back at the temple you really had decided ... to shoot Challenger , hadn 't you ? Let 's see . Challenger 's life , balanced against the lives of everyone else in the world . That is not what I call a decision . It 's a foregone conclusion . I don 't believe you . When you first arrived , you might have been able to do that . But not today . Not today . But who knows about tomorrow . *

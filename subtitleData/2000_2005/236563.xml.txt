Out of this world I will fly to the moon , find me somebody ( Secret US Military Base ) to hug and kiss me soon . Find me somebody to hug and kiss me soon . Was the White House informed ? No . The President is on the hustings . Don 't let it slip ! It would provoke a global mass hysteria . - We imposed a gag order . - Does the Pentagon think it 's dangerous ? General , I commend Defcon 2 . Be careful , Sir . - Oh my God ! - Watcha lookin ' at ? ( 300 years later ) ( Regulator ) Once upon a time our ancestors came from Earth to colonize Mars . Today we return to Earth ... to once and for all annilihate its petty inhabitants ! Jens , my trusty disciple , our vision has come true . Earth is ours now ! Queen Metapha , we are defenseless . The attack met us unprepared . Our fleet has been destroyed . - How can that be ? - They have our shield access codes ! They can even eavesdrop in on local calls . - Majesty , we must surrender ! - No , you cannot do that ! Pardon me . Those Martians came down upon us like grasshoppers . We can 't just twiddle our thumbs now ! In two hours the Mars Regulator may be sitting there , on your throne ! - There could be one last chance . - What do you mean ? Time travel . - That is unjustifiable . - But time travel is prohibited ! I think we can bend the rules a little . Please go on . We must travel back in time and prevent the colonization of Mars . - Thus , we prevent this war . - Absurd ! We don 't even know ... whether time travel is safe for humans . We 've never tested it . - And who would be able to do this ? - I was thinking of ... - the Surprise crew ! - Oh Goodness ! Those of all people ! 'Cause we 're so pretty and so canny and so slim and so slender We 'll be Miss Waikiki ! And shower to the left ! And shower to the right ! And don 't forget the soap ! One more time ! And five , six , seven , eight Five , six , seven , eight And touch and push ! And touch and push ! And towel to the left ! And towel to the right ! And don 't forget the willy ! Dry the willy to the beat ! - You cannot be serious ! - They are mankind 's last hope . Or are there any volunteers ? Are you saying that these ... these people are the only ones ... - who can save the world ? - If you really want to know , senator Eric : Yes ! We have no idea where they are . No word from them in years ! Then we have to find them , don 't we ? There they are ! - How could they bear away this far ? - Hail them ! - There are in the back of beyond ! - I bet . Captain 's log no . 1 of our Traumschiff Surprise , Captain Kork . It 's way too chilly for this stardate . All 40 men of my crew are in good health . Only two have a slight cold . Guenther has blackboard duty for this week . I am worried that in five months from now we 'll run out of stamps . Got to do something about that . Later . Today we have our yearly health check . Looking forward to having my temperature taken . If all is fine , I 'll have a nice cutlet with french fries and ketchup , a small mixed salad and a large root beer . - The same fagging every year ! - The Honolulu bathing season starts in two weeks ! You really need a flawless waistline if you want to be Miss Waikiki ! But it 's really tough on my intervertebral discs . Do Vulcanettes even have intervertebral discs ? - None of yours , you dumb cow ! - He 's not even a purebred Vulcanette . - Oh , I am ! - No , you 're a mongrel ! I am a Vulcanette Vulgaris . We can be up to 400 years old because we are a type of Galapagos turtle ! - And what are you ? - I 'm the captain . - You just screwed your way up ! - Galapagos turtle ! That 's why you 're so slow ! And you have a baboon 's ass ! ( All ) So ? - Your values are disastrous , as always . This is Groans . What 's up ? Someone from Earth , for the captain . I 'm not here . Tell Mr. Nasi to turn on the answering machine . Got it ? Groans out . Let 's go ! Get ready for the hovering test . Yes ! There are certain difficulties in contacting the Surprise . - But you have their coordinates ! - Yes , but ... there 's just the machine . What ? What ? They 're available from Monday through Friday from 4 to 5 pm . Get that crew down here ! There 's not much time left ! Aye , Sir ! Wonder what those guys are doing . Picking nose and swinging balls ! Picking nose and swinging balls ! - Starting today it 's push ups and knee bends . - Yeah sure , doc . Commencing hovering test . Goodness ! Those asses won 't move a bit . Oh my , now what do we have here ? I better put this away before the captain bags it . - Captain , aren 't we supposed to be hovering ? - Doc , why aren 't we weightless ? Cheese cake and chocolates all the time ! You 're too fat to be weightless ! I used to be in the hovering club ! I was the youngest ever in the hovering marathon ! I made my license in freestyle hovering when I was 12 , and ... at the age of 14 I won the Little Gold Star at the national youth hovering contest in Swabia ! I am Hermes , messenger of the Gods ! Adieu ! Did you know he 's got cellulitis ? Honestly ! In his room . I 'll get you ! Yes ! I 'm hovering ! Mr. Smock , come up here ! It 's wonderful up here ! - I can 't ! - He can 't . C 'mon , flat out , doc ! - Is that all you got ? - I can 't get that fat Vulcanette up . - Hey , what 's that ? - Bloody cheek ! - What 's going on there ? - Geez , really ! - Hi ! - That 's mine . - Who left his roller skates lying here ? - There ! Miss Bora-Bora ! Next time you 'll have a one-week ban on cheese cake ! And out with that chewing gum ! Mr. Nasi , what 's the situation ? Ha , Captain ! ( Nasi speaks Kantonese ) Did you understand what he just said , Mr. Smock ? - Bora stuck her tongue out at me ! - That 's no emergency , Mr. Nasi ! Captain , there 's something going on . Someone sending an emergency signal . - But it 's quite faint . - Emergency signal ? Who 'd do something like that ? Captain ? Careful , don 't get too close . The automatic control system shows a low sliding factor . They use modulated pulsing vibrations ... to get through to us . - So ? - Shall we let them in ? We can 't let that happen ! Never ! Mutt speed ! Mutt speed ! Captain , with all due respect , but mutt speed 's no dice right now . - Why not ? - Pug 's broken . - Well . Let 's call it a day . - Captain ? - What now ? I don 't know what it is , but ... it 's heading toward us . Oh my , madness . What a stress ! Read it ! Red alert . Set course for Earth and contact the government immediately . No way ! We 're in the middle of training for the Miss Waikiki contest ! We really have to prioritize here , right Mr. Smock ? - Captain ? - Yes ? Disobeying orders can get you having your shore leave cancelled . - Majesty , we have notice from the Surprise . - Finally . What do they write ? - " Need something from the convenience store ? " - What do they mean ? - Maybe it 's a code . - Ah ! When do they get here ? - We have less than an hour ! - 20 minutes on mutt speed . - But there 's a problem . - What ? - Pug damage . Yes , I know . I 've been in treatment for a while . I hope they don 't try to beam . It would kill them over that distance . Get ready to beam ! Activate ! Activate ! To be beamed or be beamed not you need to be on the right spot ! Shoo ! - Ouch ! Spotty , you mad ? - Mutiny ! - You 'll have a single room on Honolulu ! - Geez , really ! - Those things happen on Economy . Economy ? You stupid ? I 'm the captain ! You 'll beam me on Business ! - The battery 's too weak for Business . - That beam goat probably ... - left the lights on again . - Careful , here he comes . Aha ! Out with that ! - What is that ? - Friendship rings . From a befriended DA . That 's all I 'll say about that . And what 's in your pants ? - None of yours ! - Pants down . Pants down ! Yehes ! - Radiation protection . - What for ? - Beaming always gets on my balls . - Captain , I can 't work like that ! Okay ! But then you pay the cab ! - What is your report ? - Grab a seat , Regulator ! Madam Metapha got real crazy boombastic plan ! The plan is ... The Plan is ... the plan ... Okay , I forget . Sorry , Regulator-man , listen ! I write information on paper and call you back later . Ok ? Walkie talkie , man ! What was that ? Since when do dabblers work for my empire ? My Regulator , that one was a special offer at Rent-a-Spy . Along we got this cactus for free . I can send him back . - Make it so . But we 'll keep the cactus . - Yes , master . Jens , my trusty disciple . I have a mission for you . - What ? Find out what those Earth maggots are planning , so I can finally crush them . Crushing ! That 's good ! Bestow for the beautification of our ship ! Bestow for the beautification of our ship ! Bestow for the beautification of our ship ! - Bestow for the beautification of our ship ! - Well , yeah , okay . Give her something ! Thanks ! Save the whales ! Find Nemo ! - Got your passport ? Closed the window ? - Yes , I even closed the jalousies . I told you not to do that ! Everyone will know we 're not at home ! - Arguing again ? - Go away . - There 's something on you head . - That is my travelling hat . - Why do you need a travelling hat ? - I 'm paying the cab , so I 'll come along . - And what 's that ? - That 's Jutta . My reading lamp . - It 's saved my life before . - What kind of junker is that ? - Bargaining again , huh ? - I like it . - Who of you ordered a cab ? - Me ! That was me ! That was my idea ! - Who of you guys wants in the back ? - ( All ) Me ! Me ! Me ! I want the window seat ! - You cooing ? - What ? - You 're cooing over him ! - No , I 'm not . - Then let him coo a little . - Shut up and look out the window . - So , where to ? - Earth . City of Government . - Whoops ! That 'll be expensive . - Why 's that ? Right now , it 'd be easier to give someone plastic surgery during an earthquake than to arrive there in one piece . They 're firing heavy ordnance down there . Oh yes , life vests and parachutes should be somewhere below that seat . - Maybe we should get out of here ? - He 's just boasting . No problem . Just fly . I am expected by the government . My name is Captain Kork . Capricorn . I am Hermes . Messenger of the Gods . - And what is your name ? - Rock . - Soft or Hard Rock ? Grab onto something ! ( All ) Yes ! You can now buy free goods . Anyone care for some music ? ( All ) Sure ! High , High , High-Ti-Tigh , Space-Taxi to the sky . High , High , High-Ti-Tigh , Space-Taxi to the sky . Space-Taxi to the sky . Come on . ... My little heart ... ... so hot spread your legs apart ... Check it out ! ... now let 's start the show ! Eenie meenie miny moe ! High , High , High-Ti-Tigh , Space-Taxi to the sky . High , High ... What 's the commotion ? Okay girls , party 's over . I 'll report that one ! Spotty , keep that plate number in mind ! - Anyone got ink eraser ? - And I went to the washing bay yesterday . Just stop it ! I 'll be getting spots from all this stress ! Blow slowly , girls . You 'll get dizzy . Okay , now we have a problem . This is the captain . Don 't mind the shaking . We only lost our shields , one thruster went down ... - and the plasma tank is leaking . - I noticed that ! The general condition of your ... Sit down , man ! Turn right at the rotary . You are approaching the exit . Geez , finally ! Turn right after 500 metres . Not so good right now . You took the wrong turn ! C 'mon , baby , don 't let me down ! - Could you turn off the air conditioning ? - Could you shut up for a second ? If possible , please reverse course . - Good idea ! Please wait . Please hold the line . You are approaching your destination . Ensalada mista , Baby ! Don 't be foolish . Your city is completely surrounded . My Cookie squadron will be ready to attack in a few minutes . If you haven 't signed the unconditional surrender by then I will destroy you . It is futile . We have to surrender while we still have a chance . You are right . We cannot wait any longer for the crew of the Surprise . - That must be them . - Heyho ! Is the cheese cake ready ? Inform the queen ! - That was en vogue then . - I can 't read that . - Rock . - Rock what ? - Rock Thats-It . - What ? My ex-wife 's name is Thats . Mine 's It . That 's it . Thank you , Mr. Thats-It . You have been of great help to us . What ? And who 'll pay for the damage ? - A new paint job will do , I think . - Yes ! Pink Camouflage ! What ? That was a 45 Space Cruiser , a lowrider with sport suspender ! Trace elements made of Burmese titanium ! It made double speed of light in less than 1.5 seconds ! That kind of machine cannot be painted - in Pink Camouflage ! - Try to be sensible , Mr. Thats-It . - Our problems are of a different nature . - Well , I don 't care about your problems ! All I care about is that my cab is totalled because I had to - bring you these three molls ! - I bet he 's that small . You guys pay for the repairs and I 'm out of here . Okay ? And until that happens , I 'll just sit here , on this chair , and wait . Well , I don 't know about you , but I could do with some coffee now . - Chocolate ? - Nooo ! - It 's bitter chocolate by Rosetto . - It 's the brand with the Rosetto-Moor . I 'm ... not ready for that . - Who is that ? - A cab driver . We still need to pay him . Ladies and Gentlemen ... The chairman of the intercontinental security counsil . Majesty ! Esteemed senators ! 300 years ago , on July 22nd , 2004 at precisely 5.35 pm , a UFO crashed into the desert of Nevada . In that UFO , our scientists found information from a galaxy far far away . It was only with that knowledge that we were able to colonize Mars . We could prevent the colonization of Mars and thus , this war , by travelling into the year 2004 and destroying implied UFO . But how can the UFO be completely neutralized ? With this Swiss laser ! Know a nice place to go clubbing ? - Captain ? - Yes , right , absolutely ! - That 's how I would do it . - Good . Because it 's you who will be doing it . - What ? - That 'll be great . - We ? No dice ! - That 's totally impossible ! - We don 't have time for something like that . - We need to prepare for the Miss Waikiki contest . - If you refuse this mission , - there will never be a Miss Waikiki contest again . - Bring in the time machine ! - Spotty , Smock , follow me . - I want the window seat ! Shouldn 't we tell them the machine has never been tested ? Captain ... you are our last best hope . - What ? I 'd rather send a monkey to do this . - Animal welfare wouldn 't let us . You should put on these glasses . Time travel is bad for your eyes . The ignotion key will start the machine . With these coordinates you set destination time and place . - Stop it or we 'll leave you here ! - Confirm by pressing the green button . This button activates a countdown . Everything else is in this book . Don 't lose it ! You 'll never be able to return without it . And don 't waste energy . - The manual ! - Spotty , travelling with you is no fun at all ! I 'll get it ! The Cookie squadron launches a large-scale attack ! All exits are blocked ! We must get you to a safe place . We have no choice . Get onto the time machine ! I 'll stay here until my cab has been repaired ! Senator ! There 's something you need to know ! What is it ? I forgot to pack my bra . - Here . Take mine . - Thank you ! It 's okay . Press the start button ! Got it ! Spotty ! Heel ! Maybe I 'll find a better place to sit . - Yee , here we go ! - Spotty ! This will have serious consequences ! - What are you doing here ? - I wonder , too . - You 're messing everything up ! - Does this thing have a seat heater ? - No , but I sat there just a moment ago . Spotty is sneaking out of this again ! Now it 'll be single room , definitely ! Brace yourself ! Glasses on ! - I am glad to see you , Lord Shawl . - Boot licker . - What 's that ? - Rosetto 's bitter chocolate . - It 's the brand with the Rosetto-Moor . - Thanks . Kick off . The government building of the Earth alliance was successfully taken over . - Excellent . - All politicians were locked into the washhouse . - Perfect . - Metapha was able to escape on a time machine . - What ? How could you let that happen , asshole ? Yes . You 're right . But we were able to seize the manual of the time machine . Goooood . I 'm going to make a phone call . Wow ! - It actually worked ! - Unbelievable . - Now we can ... - Prevent my wedding ! - What ? - We could see Elvis live ! - The end of the world is near - and you think of Elvis ? - I dreamed of football just now . I dreamed I was a pastry cook and shaped a quarterback from marzipan . I stuck a lucky coin on top of it and put it into the shop window next to the tarts . - What country did you enter ? - I didn 't enter anything . - Captain ! Get up ! Look , a pony ! - Where are we ? A petting zoo ! - Dammit ! - Oh my ! Rowdies everywhere ! July 22nd , 1304 . A short miss . - Neat thing you got us into . - I didn 't do anything . Then maybe you should do something now . Keep cool , princess . We 'll be gone in a second . Dear Romans ! We came from the future to save the world ! Smocky , take a picture . Say cheeese cake ! Witchcraft ! Catch them ! I 'm out of here ! - Who is he ? - Who ? - He ! - Ah , I see . Who is he ? Speak , you sleazy son of a dog ! - What did you do to the woman ? - Is he of noble blood ? My name is Til Schweiger , and I make my living as an actor . It 's not much , but it 's enough for two weeks of vacation in a year . And what do you do , throne farter ? Mylord , he is a liar . This man is certainly not an actor . But he has got guts . I was told he was a remarkable fighter . An important tournament takes place tomorrow . My honor is at stake , but my best horseman was overrun by the popemobile last week . Nasty thing . - How about putting up danger signs ? - Do we have danger signs ? No , Sire , but Lord Andrew has some spare crosses . - Yes ! Put up Andrew 's Crosses ! - Hey , great idea ! Can I go now ? It is his fault my subsitute fell from his horse . Hence , he will have to win the tournament for me tomorrow . If he does , he is free . If he doesn 't , he and his entourage will be hanged and the woman will be mine . Cheers ! But Sire ! Only those of noble blood may take part in the tournaments ! That 's right . Hereby I knight you Sire of of Behynde . They travelled to the past to eradicate our existence . - This is bad news . - Well , yes . - But I also have good news for you . - Go ahead . This book contains a time machine construction manual . - I turned my moped into one . - And ? Does it work ? Yes , it does , master ! I just went and got the newspaper of tomorrow . - They won 't write about me . - For this to come true you have to stop them ! Can you trace their route ? Sure . I 'll sniff them out with my sniff radar . - Jens ! - Master ? There is something you need to know . What ? Roughly 30 years ago a baby came along , you know . Without sock and without shoe . And that , dear Jens , was you . You lost me , my Regulator . I ... am ... your father ! Okay . You can count on me , daddy ! Bye ! By the way , the Lady 's dress suits you remarkably well . She wore it just yesterday while being busy with the jester . - You have a wife ? - I had . - Where is she now ? - Hanging outside . - You hanged her outside ? Why ? For the lack of indoor gallows . - Two pizzas No. 33 for William the Endmost ! - To the Knight of Behynde ! Say , what is your star sign ? Well , your zodiac . - You do have a zodiac , don 't you ? - Well , yes ... Virgo . - A virgin ! - A virgin ? Where ? Finally ! Bring her here ! I want one , too ! Here first ! I was here before him ! Shut up ! - Virgo goes wonderfully with Butterfly . - That 's no zodiac . Yes , it is . In the Vulcanette horoscope . I am a Butterfly . We only have insects for zodiacs . House Fly , Tse Tse Fly , Blowfly , Mayfly ... or the Wasp ! - Want to see my ascendant ? - No , keep it where it is . - Save that for your boyfriend . - What ? He 's not my boyfriend . He 's just my captain . He 'd get lost without me all the time . - Besides , he has no idea what women want . - Neither do I. You have to be handsome ... Beauty is not that important . What you need is humor . I have ! A doctor tells his patient " I have good news and bad news . " " Good : You have one day to live . " " Bad : I forgot to tell you ... " " yesterday . " Forgot ... yesterday ... Not bad . Do you want to know the magical question that sets every woman 's heart on fire ? Want to go shopping ? Shopping ? And I always thought women liked men who play the piano . Baby , I 'm strollin ' on top of the sky . Baby , I 'm strollin ' on top of the sky . Why don 't you , don 't you , don 't you , Baby , come along with me ? Why don 't you come along with me ? I don 't think I will ever marry . I wouldn 't , at that . Neither would I anymore . My ex-wife took everything . My house , my dog , my job ... even my hole puncher . - Oh my , now you can 't even file anything away ! - Oh well . Let me show you something . My little pink pal stayed with me . Oh , you little piggy you ! - Say , can I touch that ? - Sure . - Oh my , it 's all shrivelled up ! - Well , it 's been in there for a while . - Yeah , I can see that . - Come , push it . - I 'd like to have one myself . - Come on , push it harder . My , where is it ? My , what 's it doing ? My , there it is ! - I don 't want to make it burst . - It won 't . My dog used to chew on it . The joust : two knights try to push each other off the horse with a lance . If your friend goes down , he loses and we will be married by tonight . I don 't think you two would make a good couple . - What 's wrong ? - Well , how did we sleep last night ? - I didn 't get a wink of sleep . - Yes , I imagine . - What 's that on your foot ? - A shoe . - Where did you get that from ? - My room mate had his leg hacked off for no apparent reason . I felt sorry and bought his shoe . - Shut up , you witches ! - Shut up , you bitches ! Dear Lords , dear Ladys , dear mob ! Our dearest patronizing host , who is delighted to see you all have come here ... Duke William the Endmost of Shareholding ! Dear Lords , dear Ladys ! Sir Further-Winston-Fattenberry of West Firstwhistle-Minster-Shatwood Castle , Third Count of Yorkshire Forest Wooden-Lancester-Puddingham ... - It 's Pettingham , you idiot ! - Ah ... oh . That 's right . Sir Further-Winston-Fattenberry of West Firstwhistle-Minster-Shatwood Castle , Third Count of Yorkshire Forest Wooden-Lancester-Pettingham , Sir Richard Carsharing , can not be with us today . Well well , the plague . Stepping into the breach ... the mysterious Black Knight ! Competing against him , under the crest of Duke William ... the Sassy Sire of Behynde ! I worked on that outfit all night . But it was worth it . Loose screw , huh ? - Jens Shawl ! - Jawohl . I will beat the Sassy Sire for you . - You have to cancel the tournament ! - Too late . In case you care at all , I don 't feel well . I have to go bisi-bisi since last night , but they don 't even have toilet paper here . Calm ! - You need to raise your lance , Rocky ! - There . You 're cooing . You said " Rocky " ! If the Black Knight wins we 're all doomed ! - It 's not the end of the world . - You have no idea ! Jawohl ! - I can 't take it much longer ! - Neither can I. Too bad about that outfit ! My bladder is about to explode and you act like a halibut in the heat ! Rock ! - Didn 't hurt at all . - Think about our future ! Don 't worry , princess . Let me handle this . He could as well resign . Your bosom will be mine ! I 'll rather go and puke then let you touch me , Duke . Put your Lanze in the air , and rock it like you just don 't care ! Everybody say , oh yeahl Oh yeah ! They asked me how I knew My true love was true . I of course replied , " Something here inside cannot be denied . " Jawohl ! Yes ! Jawohl ! Yes ! We 're getting married ! Where 's the priest ? Hey , don 't touch ! Hands off ! Heh ! - What are you planning ? - Some little fireworks for our wedding . I know how you feel . I fell from the bunk bed when I was a kid . Excuse me ! He 's lying on top of my bladder . Hey , wait ! What ? Oh Willy ! Do you want to make me happy ? Yeah , definitely ! Jawohl ! Higher , pigs ! - I 'm ready , Willy-Boy ! - Good ! Move a little together , my dear ! They 're getting away ! Let me down , assholes ! What a picture ! Stop it ! - Come on baby , where 's the cheese cake ? - In here ! Cheeeeese cake ! Oh crap . - They 're gone ! - William 's a sorcerer . Well , burn him ! Now I 'll go and meet my Lord because of that bosom I adored . - What happened ? - You were unconscious . We 're there . - Hey ! Hey , stop pulling ! - Wishi-wishi , bisi-bisi - Well , look ! - Oh thank God ! - C 'mon , hurry , will ya ? - Yeah . Look , someone forgot his pants in here . - Heave ho ! - Man , this is heavy ! That armoire goes up to the bedroom . Be careful ! These are the furniture of our new sheriff . - It all has to be perfect tomorrow . - Sure , mayor . Oh , do be careful ! I dreamed of soccer just now . I was a quarterback made of marzipan . Someone stuck a lucky coin to my head and put me into the shop window next to the tarts . - Who was that ? - Some gay pastry cook . Whoa whoa whoa ! - And where are the others ? - Piddling . That was close . I wouldn 't even wish Bora-Bora such a full bladder . Shouldn 't have had all that asparagus . Well , how do you like it ? - This outfit is so totally old fashioned . - Poppycock and fiddlesticks ! - We won 't stand out in this national costume . - You 're jingling . I have a world to save ! Watch me , this is how you move in Nevada . Shoulders up , swing your hips . Think of Johnny Weir and don 't forget your breathing ! Try it ! Forget it ! Ah , fresh asparagus tea ! It 's still warm ! - Smocky . - Leave me alone . - How far is it to the ground ? - I don 't know . - Well , please look . - I can 't . - This is the right place , but we 're in the wrong time . - Can you repair the time machine ? - Not without the manual . - What do we do now ? First of all , find the girls . Strange . I can 't get rid of the feeling ... - they 're somewhere around here . - Last warning , Smock ! - How far is it to the ground ? - Forget it ! - Are we being mutinous ? - That Rock guy is a bad influence for you ! - You 're just being jealous ! - Be careful , will you ! - Hey . The princess is worrying about me . - What do you mean ? - Well , if a woman worries about a man ... - I 'm worrying about our mission ! - And I 'm worried about my cab and my money . What ? - But we 're stuck here without the time machine ! - You should have been more careful . - I was unconscious . - Oh , so it 's my fault now ? That 's so typical ! You 're a jealous gratin ! You 'll look down now , or I 'll tell Mr. Rock that you have a green testicle ! You 're such a bully ! - I took the rap for you , Lady ! - And who kicked that leather lump into my face ? If it wasn 't for me , you 'd be a juicy steak at the stake ! - Do you have a boyfriend ? - What ? - So you don 't . I 'll tell you something . You like me . - This is not about you ! Got it ? - Excuse me , can I get my sports section back ? - Mayor Roony ! - That 's all wrong ! - More to the left ! - Mayor Roony ! A telegraph from Roswell ! It 's horrible ! God be with us ! The former sheriff ... isn 't cold and stiff yet , and they 're already coming back to town ! They 're on the 12 o 'clock train . They 're back ! - You have your mother 's pulpy porridge butt ! - Travelling with you is no fun at all ! - I 'm never taking you along again ! - So what ? There are plenty of people - who 'd love to take me along ! - Who ? That Rock-bottom maybe ? Yeah ! Our knees touched , and I got the feeling he wanted it too ! Stop smirking ! Maybe I 'll go to - Mykonos with him next year ! - I 'm not giving you a holiday . Sheriff Shorty ? Ah , I thought you 'd arrive tomorrow . Anyway . Good luck ! And you 're bigger than I expected ! - And which one is the sheriff ? - The one with the star , Jim . - Then I 'll go and save the world without you ! - Ha , you can 't ! - Yes I can . - No you can 't . - Yes I can . - No you can 't . - Yes I can . - No you can 't . - Yes I can . - I don 't believe this . - No you can 't . I have the Swiss laser ! You sly Vulcanette cow ! - Hey , are you batty ? - I believe Shorty was shorter last time we met him . Well , it 's been what , 10 years ? He could have grown . Dammit ! Game over ! Daddy will be delighted ! He 's got a moped ! Oh no , not again . Crap ! What 's wrong ? Get a grip , asshole ! John , you hold the sheriff off my back . Jim , wash your hands and go inside . Sorry , John . I can 't stay outside to play . Don 't worry . I found two new friends already . - Shoes ! - Yes , boss . - John , you have ten minutes . We have a pub to sell to the Apaches later today . - We are from the ... - People Village ! - We are peace-loving Village People . - Ladies and Señoritas ! From Medicine Bow , Wyoming , it 's your host for tonight : Mr. Santa Maria ! - Isn 't he gorgeous ? - I 'm your biggest fan ! Welcome to " The Santa Show " ! Our guest for today is Jim . Hello , Jim . - What did you bring us there , Jim ? - Rheuma blankets , boss . Isn 't that wonderful ? Schnuffi-Puffi ... Buy one , get one freel Schnuffi-Puffi ... Schnuffi-Puffi ! Schnuffi-Puffi , and your wild ride 's going on ! Now on sale ! - I think he 's cooing over you . - Really ? C 'mon ! Draw ! - What ? - Your pistol . It 's his first time ! Geez , thanks ! - I can 't get it out ! - Now you see what it 's like . - Are you alright , captain ? - Yes , but ... - Where 's Rock ? - I 'm really getting tired of hearing that name ! Who of you ordered a cab ? - Thank God , there he is ! - " Thank God , there he is !

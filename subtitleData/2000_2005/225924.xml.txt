I meant the chess . Give it up . She dosnt stand a chance . Ofcourse she has a chance . Yeah ? You 'r gonna ride in on your white horse and take her out ? The rooms can realign to zero position . No it happens , and then she 'll figure out the letters and uhh ... Sail through . And whats the first thing the program does when the rooms realign to zero position ? - Clean Sweep . - Exactly . The only thing thats gonna sail through that is their ashes . Cheer up buddy . You 'll catch you another one . The boys upstairs like 'em young and pretty . Dont you ever feel guilty ? - Si Dont you ever feel ? - Son , You 're outta line . - Yeah whatever ... - Excuse me ? Why dont you stop your doodling and do some work for a change ? Like what ? We 're wating for orders , its what we do best . Its what we do . Clean up your space . Its disgraceful . - You 're kidding , right ? - Do I look like I 'm kidding ? This one 's S-D-F . Wait a minute . - What ? - I dont know if this makes any difference , But they 're not periods , They 're commas . He 's right . They 're commas . Okay , so they 're commas . What difference does it make ? We dont even know what the letters mean yet . I mean if they were numbers , I 'd understand the commas . Understand the commas how ? Well isnt that how you plot coordinates on a graph ? X coordinate , comma , Y coordinate , comma , Z coordinate . Right . So if the room would labeld with numbers , Like 10 , comma , 1 , comma , 7 , You would know something about the rooms position . Yeah but we 've got letters that so far tell us absolutely nothing . Thats where you 're wrong , soldier . The letters tell us one important fact the number never would . - What fact ? - There are only 26 letters in the english alphabet . So ? So we know the perimeters . Exactly . If each room has its own unique letter combination , Then its a pretty good bet that this place is a cube With 26 rooms on each side . Worst case scenario , We 're anywhere from 1 to 25 rooms from the edge . - Lets go ! - Great ! Actually , Its your turn to go first . S-O-S . No kidding . Ahh .. Guess we 'll try another way . Rains , Rains , Rains , Rains ... Cassandra . Little girl 's name 's Anna . Protesters strengths , Troublemakers head north , The whole country 's going to crap . Ungrateful pigs .

You think they 're gonna stop this whole operation because you lost a piece of paper ? .. I didnt lose it . Look you know how aiming these guys are . - Maybe she 'll get another hearing . - Listen to yourself ! But this could be hugh ! A mistrial ! - Oh sure , anything you say . - Look ... See ? Told you I recognized her . " Opposition Leaders Stage Illegal Strike " She 's a political . So that would explain it . What do you mean ? I mean , there might not be a consent form . Get it ? But thats illegal . You know for a child prodigy , You 're not too bright . - We gotta do something . - Like what ? - We gotta let 'em know upstairs . - And how are we gonna do that ? Call up . - Its just for emergencies . - Well what do you think this is ? I dont see a fire . I dont see a gas leak , or flooding . I dont see you riving on the floor in a throuse of a heart attack But god knows right now I 'd like to ! She 's gonna die in there and she 's probable innocent ! None of them are innocent ! You read the files . You know what kind of people end up in there ! Exactly ! all we know is what we read in the files ... Oh my god ... What if its all bogus ? The files , the crimes , everything . Maybe they 're just putting anyone in there they dont like , maybe ... There 's a purpose , and there 's a plan . And I 'm not so stupid to think that there 's no plan just because I dont understand it ! Here 's a newsflash : We 're just the button men ! If we 're meant to be analists , we 'd be working upstairs ! Would you forget the party line for once and make the call ? Okay . You do it . You 're the hero .

And the rules clearly stake That two senior technicians have to be present At all exit procedures . Right , but I 'm not a senior technician . Hey ! I need help here . That was a phone call from upstairs Personal contact . Direct orders from above They never do that . We can 't screw this up . - We ? - Yes . We . As far as I understand , Sir , Only senior techs are allowed to preform the exit procedure . Perhaps it would be my be interest to abstain until receiveing clearence from higher up . You little prick . Okay . Okay , I get it . Look , you help me with this , I 'll tell them about your girlfriend . Okay ? - When ? - What ? When will you let them know ? As soon as we 're done with this . Allright ? Okay . - What do I do ? - Just follow my lead . Okay , here we go . Step one , Visual confirmation of subject in exit room . Oh , no . Owen . - Its Owen . - Shutup . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ! Anyone there ? Hello ? What now ? Please ! Question one . Please state your name . Hah ? Who are you ? He dosnt recognize your voice .

Question two : Do you believe in god ? What is this ? Screw you ! Please answer Yes or No . What kind of god would do this to people ? Please answer Yes or No . No . Okay ? No ! Now let me go . Let me go ! God dammit . Let me out of here ! Hit it . I need a doctor . - What does it do ? - Just hit it . Please ! For christ sake ! Still want your girlfriend to sail through to the exit ? He ... He gone . Its over . - He was one of us . - No . Once inside , He 's one of them . So this is your big exit procedure ? What are we doing here ? " Do you believe in god ? " It all hinges on that ? I just read the questions and push the buttons , okay ? What happens if you push Yes ? I dont know . No one 's ever said Yes . Here . Send this upstairs . Do it ! Do you believe in god ? What kind of animals would do this ? Owen is ... Owen is probable out sick again . - You sure ? - Yes . What are you doing ? You 're not allowed in there . I 'm through pushing buttons . No ! Stupid ! Stupid ! Stupid ! I 'm inside . Okay ... Thank god . You stupid Jackass ! Good evening , Mr. Dodd . I believe these belong to you .

My name is Jax and these are my associates Mr. Finn and Mr. Quigley . Right . Gentleman , first things first , we locate out mouse . He has no implante and so we shall have to do this the old fashioned way , I 'm afraid . Mr. Quigley , Run a visual check on all rooms , he could 'nt have got far . Yes , Sir . Mr. Finn , Run a probability tree on his potential movements - Lets have some contingency , shall we . - Right away , Sir . Excuse me , Mr. Jax . Excuse me , Sir . Yes Mr. Codd ? Its Dodd , Sir . What do I do ? - I 'm sorry ? - What do ... ? Yes I allmost forgot I have your orders from upstairs . Its a personal delivery . " Order number 7-9-3 , bla , bla , bla , bla ...

Do us a tinsi favor and use Mr. Wynn 's auxillary monitor . We 'll need the big guns here for our little mouse hunt . Ofcourse , Sir . Anything I can do to help , sir ... That the spirit Mr. Modd , way to keep the world safe for democracy . - Have we got a visual yet ? - Still working of it , Sir . Okay , K-G-K . Three odds . M-A-Q . Three odds . Safe . Like taking candy from a baby . A-Z-Z . A-Z-Z ! Got it . I dont know why we bother with these things anymore . A-Z-Z . Its the first time i 've seen a Z. - Do you think it means anything ? - I dont know . Ah , Dont let the door close ! Dammit ! She 's gone . Got it . Subject it isolated . And now the tricky part . Okay . You were last seen here . That was an hour ago . She should still be in the same coordinate . Rooms are in move . They have to . She can 't be that far . Yeah but if we veer too far offcourse looking for her we 'll never find the edge . Yeah then what you suggest , killer ? That we 'll cut off our loses ? Ah , Guys . Are we sure this room is safe ? Maybe he just starved to death . God I 'm hungry . - What are you doing ? - We could use these . - We have to keep moving . - We have to get back on track . We 've allready chased our tails for an hour looking for her . God this headache is not going away ... - Maybe its that chip in your head . - What ? Its true isnt it . I mean an output bio-receivers in all you army boys . Keeps you on the leash . Lady you 've got a hell of imagination . Jackpot . Its her . Dammit . Is she allright ? She 's not moving . Great .

I need a doctor . - Dont let her touch you ! - Let go ! - Watch it ! - Oh my god ! Dont leave me ! I didnt mean too ... She scratched and I ... You put her out of her misery . My headache 's gone . Something 's eating her . Chemical or virus . We never checked this room for traps . I could be in the air . - Lets see your arm . - We 've got to get out 'ta here . - Show me your arm . - He 's right , we 've gotta get outta here . Your arm . Where she scratched you , Lets see it . - Why , you think ... ? - Yes , I think ! Fine ! there , see ? Nothing ! Flesh wound . Sure . Nothing . What do we do with him ? What do you mean ? I think whatever was eating away at her , is spreading to him . - Hey i 'm still here ! - Not for long ! - I say we ditch him . - Screw you ! Just relax guys , nobody 's ditching anyone . Look at him . Oh my god . What ? Your face . Crap . Please dont leave me . This is horrible . You wanna babysit a dead man ? Be my guest . Please . I 'll do anything . Anything ? From now on , You test the rooms . All of them . Fine . Well , we 're not going down there . No sense wasting a good boot . Help me ! He 's still alive down there ! Forget it , he 's gone . You heartless son of a bitch ! No ! - Dont come near me . - I was protecting us . - You murdered him . - He was infected . You saw it , it was spreading . We 'd be dead by now . - You dont know that . - Actually , he 's right . Its a hightly contagious form of a virus . - Flesh eating disease . - Who the hell are you ? I ... I 've come to help . - Damn . - Problem , Mr. Scrod ? - No problem Sir . - Anything of interest ? Actually Sir , I was about to ... Would you care to share with the rest of the class ? Yes Sir . As I was running my test series as instructed Sir , The query intersected with my subject , Sir . Good work , Rod . Who says they only hire the mentally challenged down here ? Open . - Thank you , Sir . - Up on the main monitor now , Please . We keep ... They , collect data and run tests . All kinds of tests . Testing Chemical and Biological agents , Measure brain activity , endurance , most of it I dont even understand . And thats just what I see in my department . I hear about others who do different work . I even heard there are other facilities . Cubes . Christ . I just heard rumors . - Why can 't we remember anything ? - I dont know , I allways assume that they could have a blank slate to work with . Blank slate ? Bastards you 've been using us as lab rats . Hey man , Not me . I 'm just the computer guy , system checks . Stuff like that . Oh yeah , you just followed orders . Yeah . - You make me sick . - Look , you got it all wrong . - I hate my job . - You 're job ? How can you do this to people . It was you 're choise . You volunteered , only you don 't remember anymore . At least that what they told us . And you believed them ? Well , yeah . I saw the consent forms . Accept for yours ! You 're lying ! Who would volunteer for this ? Well it was either this or execution so ... What ? They say you 're all condemned prisioners , Who volunteered for the experiment instead of facing the death penalty . I never did anything to deserve this . Yeah well , tell it to Meyerhold , Right ? - We 're innocent , dammit ! - I didnt volunteer for this ! I know , becouse your consent form is missing ! Shut up ! While you were doing your system checks , Did you happen to see a little girl ? No . Yes . I mean , I saw her . I saw one little girl ... In your dreams . - What ? - Yeah . Its hard to explain . Here . You see , another thing they have us do , is record the subjects , The people 's dreams . Her name 's Anna , Right ? - They can see into our dreams ? - Yeah . Where is my daughter , you piece of shit ? ! - I dont know ! - You 're lying ! No , Please ! I came to help ! Rains ! We need him . - Why ? - I can show you the exits . Go ahead , where are they ? You were wrong about the cube . Its only 25 room all around . Only 2 rooms have Z coordinates valued 26 . They periodically move to the perimeter , But two exit points are monitored . And there 's supposed to be an auxillary exit . That leads directly outside the cube . How to we get to that one ? I dont know . So what use is he ? - Can you show us how to avoid the traps ? - Yes , definitely . Okay . Just read me the coordinates from the surrounding rooms , please . I was right . The coordinates . Well , well ... It seems that our little mouse , is a rat afterall . Mr. Finn , could you do something about that , please ? Yes , Sir . This one 's C-F-P . The hell ... ? - Damn . - What is it ? - The letters . They just disappeared . - What ? They 're all gone . They know i 'm here . - So now will be a good time to move . - Good idea . You first . Okay . I cant make any promises , but this should be the way . Mr. Quigley , could you isolate that quadrate for me please ? Mr. Finn , show me the current trap configuration , " si vous plait " . " Merci " . Lets make their life a little more interesting , shall we ? Okay ... Trapped. sure is easy from my desk . They trapped all the rooms around us . Now what ? Really glad you showed up to help . My god , I 'm actually starting to enjoy myself . You know what ? I think we should keep getting togther and doing this alot more often . God dammit . What ? Sir . Yes , Sir . Yes , Sir . Sorry , Sir . Right away , Sir . " Just finish it , you idiot . " Ungrateful cretinous . You didnt hear that . Okay gentleman , we have the word from on high . Its time to blow this popsicle stand . - Mr. Quigley . - Sir ? You heard the man . Just finish it . Yes Sir . Okay , let me think , let me think . What the ... ? Now what do we do ? The floor. the floor . I 'm sorry . God dammit ! I dont wanna die in here ! Whats happening ? What stopped it ? I dont know . Come 'on , you piece of ... - What the hell ? - I dont know Sir , we suddenly lost contact . Yes , I can see that . Why ? Maybe the energy required for the test itself blew out the capacitor . I mean , we 're not talking state-of-the-art equipment . Wrong . That 's not how it works , That 's not how it was designed . Someone is screwing with the connection . I dont know Sir , it is 'nt me . Me neither , Sir . What ? I have no idea . Its not me , I swear . You would 'nt lie to me , Now whould you Mr. Clodd ? No Sir . Would 'nt think of it . Questions ? Comments ? What are we wating for ? Get us back online ! Damn . - Nothing . - " Nothing " is not an answer . Excuse me , Sir . - Excuse me ? - What is it ? Can I use the facilities , Sir ? Just go ! For the love of god , Where do they find these people ? I dont think its software , Sir . - Its definitely a hardware problem . - Listen . This is getting embarrassing now . Okay ? I need to remind you Gentleman , that in a few minutes We 'll have no choise but to send people in there . Call me impulsive but I could probable think of a couple of mates : Quigley ! Finn ! You know , right of the top . What is that noise ? ! Something 's wrong with the main power source . Its gone into reset mode . What the hell is going on ? Boot . - Damn . - You can say that again . What ? Power go out ? Yeah . So the traps dont work . - Thats the good news , yeah . - Whats the bad news ? Its gone into reset mode . The system will restart itself in 10 minutes , the first routine that runs on restart , is a clean sweep . - That is bad as it sounds ? - Clean sweep program flash incinerates anything still living in all the rooms . - So , we gotta move . - Which way do we go ? I dont know . Okay , last time I run the numbers you were pretty much in the center of the structure . so I guess we just keep going in the same direction until we get to the edge , right ? Great , so we 're back to square one ! - Do you have a better idea ? ! - No . I dont . ' couse I 'm not the one who uses people as a fucking game in this place ! Wait ! Back to square one ! Dodd . Dodd is the only one who can power down this quickly . But he knows that reset would kick in , so why whould he ... ? Of course . Clean sweep happens after they realign to zero position . - What ? - Quick . Let me see your map . When the power comes on , the rooms are programmed to realign back to their original positions before the clean sweep starts . now , if we 're in one of the exit room , Like A-Z-Z , it will move us to the perimeter , and we 'll have about ... 3 seconds to get out . - Before it fries us . - Yeah . If that room has 'nt moved , we 'd might just make it . Yeah . You know Mr. Wod has been in the little boy 's room an awfully long time . Come 'on , Come 'on . Gotcha A noble attempt to save your protege , Mr. Dodd . But quite foolish , ultimately . May I have that widget back , please ? I dont I can do that , Sir . Mr. Dodd , are you disobeying a direct order ? Yes , There ... Cute , and rather , clichee , in an endearing kind of way . Unfortunately , I do believe there is penalty , a rather strict penalty , for sabotaging state property . Instant paralysis ! They weren 't kidding , were they . However , not to worry , Mr. Dodd , You still will be able to feel . 5 minutes to reset . I think I 've found the source of our problem . Does anyone knows where this goes ? Anyone ? That the central coupling . I got it , Sir . Still dosn 't solve our observation problem , they could be escaping as we speak . Sir , in less then 5 minutes from now the clean sweep kicks in , and then I think our problem will evaporate . Mr. Finn , I dont trust machines . I have a machine to thank for this , and this . I need to see them , with my our god-given eye . Of course Sir , I just , I dont know how ... Sometimes I even amaze myself . Mr. Finn , one of our runaway rats is a formal squad soldier . Is he not ? Yes Sir , that would be Haskell , the big fellow . And they still bio-chip the enlisted men , do they not ? Of course . Sir , thats brilliant ... Mr. Quigley comes through . Mr. Finn , Aquire us an uplink to the squad surveillance network . Yes Sir . Right away , Sir . - Time ? - We still have 4 minutes ! Hold on ! There 's no way he survived that . We gotta go . Come 'on . - We 're locked on . - Sir , we have a visual . Its a weak signal . Your tax dollars hard at work . Transmit the kill code . Pain inhibiters , activated . Neuro-can enhancers , amplified . - Are we there yet ? - Allmost . Haskell ? Move it ! Get off her ! Thanks . Okay Come 'on . - How much further ? - We 're allmost there . A-Z-Z . This is it ! Its Okay . The power 's out . The power 's out . Chickliss ... Oh man ... - There 's over one minute ! - Can 't this thing go any faster ? - Sir , We 've the display back . - They 're out of the perimeter . 30 seconds to clean sweep . Well I think its time for our little surprise . I hope your shortcut worked , Mr. Quigley . - Water . - The auxillary exit . Leads directly outside . - Now what ? - Can you swim ? Jump ! Well ? Did we get them ? Sorry Sir . Signal got scrambled at flash point . I think we got 'em I dont like it . Get a squad to the exit point . This way ! - Come 'on . - Run ! Run ! Go ! He 's consciousness . Thank god . Well , welcome back Mr. Wynn . You 're consciousness . Yes we can begin now . " Eric Wynn , as you have been found guilty of high treason , sabotage and very severe crimes against your country and your god , and so on , bla , bla , bla ... " Your sentence has been extended for two more lifetimes . What sentencse ? I dont remember the trial ! Well , you were found guilt . No further questions . Wait ! What are you doing ? Well , we 've decided on a few modifications before putting you back inside . - Wait ! - Mr. Wynn , You are holding up progress . Dont I get a choice ? Dont all the condemned get a choice ? I choose death ! No , Mr. Wynn . You do not get a choice . You have allready made your choice . I believe this is your signature ? - I dont understand . - " I dont understand " . You chose to become a test subject . Many years ago . And you simply dont remember that . Its all standard procedure . But my job ? Dodd ? Owen ? Chickliss ? All lab rats . Just Like you . Observing the observers , you know , that kind of thing . Very interesting results . Wait ! - Your actually starting to bore me now . - Where is she ? Ah , the allusive Ms. Rains . Ah .. Well , You needn 't worry about her . You didnt catch her . He 's all yours . - Dont touch me . - Dont worry . This wont hurt . Wait ! Mommy , I 'm cold . Why can 't we have a fire ? Because the bad people might find us . I have something to show you . See . Thats us . We 're superheroes . These are very special because they were drawn by a very special person . Is he a superhero too ? Yes . Yes , he is . What wrong with him ? He dosn 't seem to know we 're here . This room is green . Hi there . - This room is green . - Yes , It is . What is it , shock ? I wanna go back to the blue room . I think he 's mentally handicapped . - Thats all we need , a retard . - Dont ! How the hell did he survive in here ? I wanna go back . I wanna go back . Back . Back . I wanna go back . Wanna go back . Translated and Synchronized by : Storm ! SM

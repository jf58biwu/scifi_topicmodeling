 [ Clears Throat ] I 'm on the Clay Street platform . Got a fare jumper . White male , shaved head , 20s . Possible 10-13 . [ Brakes Squealing ] [ Bell Dings ] Offiicer Philbrick , all clear . [ Man Screams ] [ Electrical Crackling ] Deputy Chief Karras , Transit Police . This is Lieutenant Bianco . - You 're Scully and Doggett , right ? - Yes . Is the assessment team here ? Downstairs , waiting 45 minutes . Where the hell have you two been ? Agent Scully needed to examine the body ... of the victim fiirst . Who 's missing the picture here ? I got lots of people can examine the body . What I need from the FBI now ... is a time frame . A time frame ? One of the main arteries ... of the Boston public transport system has been closed ... for exactly 11 hours and 4 minutes . My phone is ringing off the hook right now ... with calls from the press . I got 100,000 pissed-off commuters ... who were late to work this morning who are going to be ... even more pissed off if they can 't get home . And I got one extremely pissed-off mayor ... paying me to do one thing- - keep the damn trains running . We appreciate the pressure that you 're under , but- - No . It 's you guys better kick it in the ass . The afternoon rush starts in fiive hours . Do what you 've got to do ... but this line is going back in operation at 4 : 00 p.m. I 'm afraid you can 't do that . Oh , yes , I can . You 've got a dead man ... who 's got over 1l3 of his body tissue completely eaten away ... and until we fiigure out how and why ... that tunnel cannot be reopened . We understand the FBI 's need to do ... a thorough investigation , but as I see it ... the facts of this case are actually pretty simple . Simple ? The train briefly lost power ... during which time an assailant killed a Boston transit cop . That man is still at large . An assailant using what ? Acid , lye . Your examination of the victim must 've told us something . No , it didn 't , that 's the thing . Until we culture the tissue and run the proper tests ... we 're not going to know what killed him ... or if it can infect others . [ Bianco ] The Centers for Disease Control ... had robotic sniffers in the tunnel all night . They found no trace of biological or chemical agents . So let 's clear this up . What we 're looking for is a man- - a cop-killer . Single suspect . At least that 's your cover story . That 's what you 're telling the press . [ Karras ] The question is ... can you get me the killer or an explanation ... in less than fiive hours ? Because hell or high water ... this subway reopens at 4 : 00 p.m. sharp . Now , let 's go . Steven Melnick ... Transportation Authority 's ... chief structural engineer . He built this tunnel . [ Melnick ] I only oversaw construction of it ... four years ago . But I know every square inch down there . Dr. Hellura Lyle , special pathogens branch , CDC . We were told you folks said ... that the tunnel was clear of pathogens . Well , I guess I 'm just here for the moral support . We 're just covering our bases . What base are they covering ? [ Karras ] Agent Scully is a medical doctor ... who they tell me has a lot of experience ... with equivocal death . [ Melnick ] Equivocal ? I mean , you 're dead or you 're not , right ? Deaths for which there may be ... many explanations or for which ... an explanation may be hard to fiind . And what about you ? I 'm just a good shot . Well , good . Now that we 're bosom buddies ... let 's get this show on the road . You need some help with that ? No . - You 're going in without me . - What ? I don 't know what kind of games are being played ... but I 'm going to be much more effective ... analyzing the situation from up here . Yeah , but I 'm just a tagalong here . This is your thing . You 've got all the experience . You 've got capable people with you , Agent Doggett . What I need down there are eyes and ears . Okay . I 'll be your ... eyes and ears . Only I wish someone would tell me ... what the hell it is ... I 'm supposed to be looking for . Third rail 's powering down . You 're clear to enter the subway floor ... and as long as you stay on this line ... there should be no risk of accidental shock ... or electrocution . You copy that , Agent Doggett ? Yep , we 're on the tunnel floor . Hope you got yourself a nice clear picture , Agent Scully . We got you every step of the way . [ Lyle ] Ooh , it feels like Atlanta in August . Yeah , it 's the middle of winter . How come it 's so hot down here ? They shut down ventilation last night . Normally you have almost a million cubic feet ... of fresh air per minute pushing through here ... but now we 're in a sweat box . [ Lyle ] Aren 't we lucky ? Hot , sticky and crawling in the dark . All so every commuter in Boston ... can get home to watch Survivor II . I wonder why they shut down the ventilation ... if it 's a man we 're supposed to be looking for . You doubt that so much , Agent Doggett , why bring a gun ? Agent Doggett , you still reading me down there ? Like a songbird , Agent Scully . [ Man Yells ] My shirt , my neck ... get it off ! . What 's going on ? [ Melnick ] Something 's burning ! [ Bianco ] Just hold still . What just happened ? I don 't know . He 's got a burn on his neck ... silver-dollar sized . You get seepage down here ? Yeah , constantly . This line was tunneled through landfiill adjacent to the harbor . It 's a part of the big dig . There was a puddle 20 yards back . You hear that , Agent Scully ? Yeah . Ask Dr. Lyle if she can get a sample . [ Doggett ] We need you to get a sample . [ Lyle ] I 'm on it . Maybe it 's not a man ... we 're looking for ... but some sort of toxic leak . We were told there are ... no contaminants down here . Tell her I 'm sending this . [ High-pitched Beeping ] We 're transmitting . [ Doggett ] You on line , Agent Scully ? Yeah , I got it . I 'm getting a reading . Sample analysis is showing ... carbon , bromide , boron and calcium . It 's just seawater . Let me get on the phone . Maybe I can get a molecular analysis . Four hours , Agent Scully . Take it easy . Agent Doggett ! What ? What is it ? There 's somebody in the tunnel . All right , let 's go fiind him . Open this line in four hours ... passengers will get more than just a ride- - they 'll get a steam bath to boot . What are you doing ? If this guy was going to shoot me ... he already had his chance . Besides , I 'm sweating like a pig . Mr. Melnick , what 's this ? It 's a tunnel from the old system . Been shut down for years . You see this , Agent Scully ? You have this on your graphic ? Yeah . It 's a fork in the line . That line is obsolete . It 's been gutted and decommissioned . How far from here to where the train lost power , Agent Scully ? [ Scully ] It 's about a mile up the main tunnel . He 's going to waste valuable time going in there . [ Scully ] Agent Doggett . Agent Doggett . I 'm just taking a look . All right , let 's get out of here . Mr. Melnick ... what 's your call ? You think there 's any good reason ... to pursue this section ? Lots of places to hide in here . [ Doggett ] Dr. Lyle ? Agent Doggett , look out ! Agent Doggett , what happened ? Can you hear me ? Yeah . Nah , give me a minute . What hit me ? Well , he came at you like some kind of phantom . [ Scully ] What did ? Agent Doggett . - Would you call that equivocal ? - Agent Scully ... Uh , okay , I see it . Um , I 'm going to need some data . Agent Scully needs some data . [ Lyle ] I 'm already on it . I think this is the guy that killed Offiicer Philbrick . [ Lyle ] I 'm transmitting some photos . [ Doggett ] Here comes your data ... Agent Scully . Oh , my God . Where you going ? I think I just saw something . - What 's the problem ? - There 's no problem . This man flits the description called in by my transit cop . We found what we were looking for . Let 's get him wrapped up and go home . See it ? There 's something on the floor . [ Doggett ] Agent Scully ... we got bodies . Looks like three males . Agent Scully ? Yeah , I see them . Can you get any closer ? Smell 's a little overpowering . They 've been here for a while . Looks like someone wrapped them up and stashed them down here . Can you get them uncovered ? They look like squatters , from the way they 're dressed . I 'm not sure I want to touch these . I see signs of the same tissue degradation ... we saw in the other victims . We may have a contagion here after all . [ Bianco ] What did she say ? Dr. Lyle , down here . Oh . The CDC may be wrong . Somebody 's over here ! Agent Doggett ? Whatever she saw- - What did you see ? Somebody out here just took off . I don 't see where . Look , we 're done down here . Let 's get this show on the road . Agent Doggett ... Hold it , Lieutenant . Agent Doggett , if there 's somebody else down there ... you 're going to need to fiind them . What are you doing , Agent Scully ? Get those people out . " " Those people " just found three dead bodies ... and I want to know what happened to them . Look , they are in ... an obsolete , decommissioned tunnel . I 'll get a crew down in there tonight ... after rush hour . You don 't understand . They could be infected and contagious . With what ? Seawater ? You are being irrational here . The CDC says there are ... no contaminants . I 'm going to take their word on it . Then who are those dead men and how did they die ? Probably tunnel rats . Squatters attacked by the same man who killed my transit cop . Then take a look at the man ... who flits the description of your killer , okay ? Just look at his injuries . He died the same way . There is something down there ... and I am not going to risk bringing it up here ... before I fiigure out what it is ! Agent Scully ... Yeah ? What do you want us to do ? I want you to leave those bodies where you found them ... and go after whoever it is who 's in that tunnel . We need to know whether he is causing this ... or if he 's infected himself . Either way , he may kill more people . I 'm sure Dr. Lyle will agree . All right , we just got our order . We 're going to continue on . Says who ? Says the boss . Agent Doggett . This agent you work with deals with weird stuff , right ? She works on something called the X-Files- - FBI cases dealing with unexplained phenomena . You know her at all ? Yeah , I know her . We 've worked together for a short time . I wonder why she sent you down here ... instead of coming herself . It 's the right call . You got a problem , Lieutenant ? Yeah . A problem when somebody I don 't know keeps me down here ... in the dark looking for jack squat ... when we 've already found our man . It 's a question of contagion . It 's a question of who 's in charge . Agent Doggett ? Yeah . You all right down there ? Fine . What do you got for us ? You 're about 50 yards from the spot ... where the train stopped . What am I looking for ? I don 't know . Anything . Get it off me . Get it off me ! What is it ? I don 't know , but it burns ! Just hold still . Let us see it . It burns ! What is it ? What 's happening ? Agent Doggett ? ! I can 't tell what it is . [ Screaming ] [ Doggett ] Agent Scully , talk to me . Yeah , um , get some fresh water on it ! Give me water here ! [ Screaming Continues ] What the hell was that ? I don 't know , and I don 't like it that you don 't know . Agent Scully , talk to me ! I don 't know what to say . I , mean , i-it 's something attacking the dermis . Attacking ? It ate his arm off ! . I hate to say this , Agent Doggett ... but it looks like it could be some kind of biochemical weapon . Great . What ? What did she say ? She said a lot of people might ... be taking cabs home tonight . What the hell is this thing ? ! It might be a terrorist using some kind of biochemical agent . Might ? What , is she guessing ? Agent Doggett , I pulled up a map of the subway grid ... where you are now . I want you to listen to me . Agent Scully 's telling me the tunnel we 're in ... connects to another tunnel 100 yards up . It 's the only place for another mile ... that this guy could be hiding . Well , this man ain 't going nowhere . Then you take care of him . I 'll have a Haz-Mat team come down here and prep you for quarantine . - Lieutenant , let 's go . - [ Lyle ] All right , buddy . We 're gonna get you out of here . Come on . Come on . I 've got you , buddy . Hang in there . Dr. Lyle ... Dr. Lyle , how are you feeling ? Me ? Yeah . Well , I seem to be okay , but Melnick ... Melnick is getting worse . Well , we got vehicles on the way . The CDC doctors have been informed of your conditions . So , what are they going to be treating us for ? How are they going to treat Melnick ? I 'm working on that . Hey ! What are you doing ? ! Hey , where are you taking them ? Those bodies go to the CDC . Look , as a federal agent ... I order you to stop and explain yourself . Agent Scully , we are on a deadline here ... which is fast approaching . These bodies need immediate examination and diagnosis . And that is being arranged . By whom ? I already arranged it . You knew those bodies were down there , didn 't you ? I 'd watch yourself , Agent Scully . Look at the way they 're wrapped . Somebody sealed them in plastic , hoping they wouldn 't be found . Look , if I fiind out you sent my partner and those others down there ... knowing about this- - You are way out of line here . I want to see inspection reports . I want to know who was down there in that tunnel ... and what they saw . I 'll get you anything you want . Good . Now , let 's get these bodies to the CDC ... where they 're supposed to go . What 's this here , Lieutenant ? Abandoned station- - old stop . Agent Scully ... Agent Scully ... Here we are , we 're pissing away our time ... and she 's asleep at the wheel . Agent Scully ... Come on , Agent Doggett . Make a decision . Let 's get out of here . We got to fiind whoever it is ... that 's still down here , Lieutenant . And what if we don 't fiind him ? Maybe it 'll be us they fiind ... lying facedown on the floor , dead . Agent Scully knows what she 's doing . This is about saving people 's lives . Well , it looks like ... it 's about saving her life . If she knows what she 's doing ... why hasn 't she fiigured it out yet ? Lieutenant ... walk towards me . What ? What , damn it ? That stuff s on me . You see that ? It 's spreading . I told you , Agent Doggett- - we should 've gotten out . That 's exactly why we got to stay . You saw ! You saw what it does . Yeah , I saw what it did . But I don 't see it having any other effect on you ... so just calm down . I 'm getting out of here . I 'm leaving . [ Cocks Pistol ] You 'd do it , wouldn 't you ? Not because I want to . But you 're pushing pretty hard . So put your weapon down , Lieutenant , right now . Now , we 're going to get out of here ... but we 're going to wait for the okay . Agent Doggett ? Agent Doggett , can you- - Agent Doggett ? Come in , Agent Doggett . Agent Doggett ! Come in , damn it ! [ Crash ] Is this a bad time ? Excuse me ? I don 't know , I 'm looking for an FBI agent Dana Scully . Do you know where I can fiind him ? No ... yes ... I mean , I 'm-I 'm she . Can I help you ? Yes . I 'm Dr. Kai Bowe . I was sent a scribbled note ... and a saltwater sample for analysis . I 'm a marine biologist from BU . I 'm sorry . Yes , Dr. Bowe , please . Um ... did you get an analysis ? Well , yes , I have something to show you , that 's for sure . I 'm going to assume you 're in a hurry . [ Unzips Briefcase ] This is an image taken from a stereo microscope ... of what 's called a medusa . Your saltwater sample was rather deceiving . Its components are exactly as you 'd expect ... except for higher levels of calcium . This creature is primarily that . Calcium ? Yes , it 's what powers ... its movement and gives it bioluminescence . So you 're saying that this is a sea creature ? Which is why the CDC missed it . Well , it 's hard to fiind . I daresay I 'm not even sure if it 's of the sea ... but ... wherever it 's from , it ... it 's quite incredible . It 's killing people . How ? I don 't know . There is seawater in that subway tunnel ... and it 's eating people 's flesh off . It 's producing some kind of a reaction ... that looks almost electrical . On contact ? No . Something triggers it . Have you been in the tunnel ? No , I have not . But my partner is down there , and I fear the worst . [ Bianco ] Hey , hey ... anybody out there ? [ Pounding ] Somebody ! Anybody hear me ? ! Anybody ? ! [ Scully ] Agent Doggett ? Agent Doggett , can you hear me ? Agent Doggett ? Yeah . I 'm here . I hear you . Oh , you had me . I , uh ... I started fearing the worst . No , I ... I got blindsided by ... I don 't see Lieutenant Bianco . He 's infected with something . I saw it glowing on his skin . And what 's your condition , Agent Doggett ? I 'm going to assume it 's not good . I 'm going to send a quarantine unit down ... to get you , Agent Doggett , okay ? I want you to stay right where you are . I appreciate it , Agent Scully ... but I can 't do that . If we 're going to stop the spread of this thing ... I got to stop Lieutenant Bianco . Dr. Bowe , I need you to get on the phone with the CDC . Tell them everything we know . We have to learn as quickly as possible ... what sets this thing off . Look ... I need you to blockade ... any and every exit from the system . You 've got a possible outbreak situation here . No , no . That 's not going to happen . No , you listen to me . Your lieutenant is infected and at large in the system ... and he is looking for a way out . I hear you . It 's just that there are already ... passengers waiting on the platform . Agent Doggett ... we 've got a new wrinkle . Don 't tell me . We 're running out of time . It 's 20 to 4 : 00 . I 'm moving as fast as I can . Agent Doggett , you shouldn 't be moving at all . In 20 minutes ... I 'll be taking a long bath at the hotel . Right now , I got to fiind this guy . This organism that 's on your skin- - something triggers it , and I don 't know what . It could be body temperature . It could be heart rate . It could be from standing still , too , right ? Maybe the only thing keeping me from sparking up right now ... is that I 'm moving . Yeah , I guess you 're right . I 'm getting out of this thing , Agent Scully . Just make sure Karras holds those trains till I fiind Bianco . He 's got passengers waiting at the next station . You tell that son of a bitch he 's got to clear the system . He 's- - Wait . I see something . Lieutenant ... He 's hurt . You see this , Dr. Bowe ? You see this , Mr. Karras ? You 're on with the CDC ? I need anything they can give me ... about what sets this organism off- - an idea , a notion , a wild guess . Agent Scully ... what do you want me to do ? Get out of there ... Agent Doggett . What about this man ? I 'm going to send a Haz-Mat team down for him ... but from what I 've seen ... the reaction 's progressive . Please , Agent Doggett ... don 't leave me . I hope you 're enjoying the ride . You see this , Agent Scully ? Yeah . Who else is down there ? We don 't know . You , there ! Stop ! Federal agent ! I 'm armed ! Agent Scully , believe this ? [ Doggett ] Who are you ? What 's your name ? What are you doing down here ? What 's he pointing at ? I don 't know . Is he infected ? Agent Doggett , turn the light away . Nothing . He 's unaffected . How 's that ? I think I just fiigured it out . I might know what triggers this . What is it ? Sweat . Perspiration is a conductor for calcium ions ... promoting a chemical-electrical reaction . Electricity ? That 's right . And since the boy 's sweat glands ... aren 't fully developed ... then he wouldn 't be as conductive . Just my luck . Agent Doggett , where 's he going ? I don 't know ... but he wants me to follow him . Agent Scully , I don 't know if you can see this . I think I found the source of the contagion . It looks like a big leak in the ceiling ... is crumbling the walls ... flooding into the system . It must have seeped in from the bay . Hey , where you going ? You see this ? The kid 's walking right through this stuff . Yeah . I 'm ... I 'm checking my graphic here . It ... it looks like he 's trying to lead you through ... to a tunnel on the main system . And , if what I 'm looking at is accurate ... it would put you about 400 yards ... from an access point . I mean , if I could put a Haz-Mat team together ... we might be able to have you out in about 15 minutes . Come on , Lieutenant . We 're in through to the main system , Agent Scully ... and we got big , big problems here . Yes , we do . You see this flooding ? No . It 's worse than that . I think this moron Karras ... has started the trains rolling . [ Train Whistle Blowing ] [ Whistle Blowing ] Agent Doggett ... what are you doing ? Agent Doggett ... Get off the tracks , Agent Doggett . Get out of there ! We got people on the train . They could get infected . Get out of there , Agent Doggett ! Let me have this . Give it to me ! Give it to me ! I got an idea , Agent Scully . [ Scully ] Agent Doggett ? Talk to me , Agent Doggett . [ Electrical Crackling ] Agent Doggett ? Are you there ? Can you hear me ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . Thank God . Uh ... I lost you on the visual . Okay ... Okay , I 've got you . You 're back . Are you okay ? I can only hope , Agent Scully . [ Clicking ] Nurse ! Nurse ! Where do you think you 're going ? Find the nurse . She said she was going to talk to the doctor ... about me going home . I could be dying in here for all she knows . Well , you 're not ... Agent Doggett . Your skin and body ... have been rid of the organism . Simple alcohol bath cleaned you right up . I was just down talking to the nurse ... and I told her I 'd come and give you the news . Well , can I get out of here ? Yes . What about the others ? Well , the kid is with social services ... and plastic surgeons are working on Melnick and Bianco ... and Dr. Lyle has been discharged . You know , I 'd like to think ... that this was over ... but there 's going to be hell to pay ... for these guys . No . It 's over , Agent Doggett . Excuse me ? This guy Karras put a train back on the tracks . He recklessly endangered people 's lives . But there is no proof of that . What do you mean , there 's no proof ? What I 'm saying ... is that the organism is no longer extant . It 's destroyed . By what ? I 'm guessing by the electrical charge ... that you set off . We have victims . Dead bodies . Infected by a pathogen of unknown etiology . Look , Agent Doggett ... not a criminal charge is going to stick . These guys were just doing their job- - keeping the trains running . But they 've got you to thank . And not just for saving their butts . No . You fiigured it out . I was just your eyes and ears . Agent Scully ... Let 's go home .

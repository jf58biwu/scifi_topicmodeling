 It 's here . They 're unloading the Rolls . - Miss Prince ? - Yes . You 're right on time . One custom 1935 Rolls-Royce Laundalet ... with platinum hood ornament coming right up . Thank you very much , sir . Always a pleasure to accommodate the IADC . All right , fellows , let 's get the doors open . So what do we got going on here ? Some kind of a spy caper or something ? That 's a Rolls , all right . But ain 't it kind of small ? Stop that car . Raise this higher . Move it to the left . Wonder Woman , what is happening , sister ? What 's in the back ? I don 't know , ma 'am , I guess it was a mix-up . Someone must have goofed and sent two trucks to the same place . I don 't know nothing about a stolen car . Did you get a good look at the other driver ? No , ma 'am ... he was so teed off about the mix-up he refused to get out of the cab . At least , that 's what it looked like . Nobody told me that the IADC ... and two females were going to interfere . - Interfere ? - Would you settle for " meddle " ? For your information , Inspector Bolt ... Wonder Woman and I were trying to retrieve - For your information , Agent Prince , I was there on a tip ... that could 've busted the biggest car theft ring since original sin ! I was going to tail that Rolls-Royce to its original source . And , I suppose , you think your car thieves ... are more important than national security . - My car thieves ? - All right . Enough squabbling , for crying out loud . You want the man behind the car theft ring , right ? Right . Diana , you and I want that hood ornament off the antique Rolls . Now it 's been decided and agreed upon ... that the two of you will be working together . Okay . Maybe I was off base . I take it all back . Except , the female part . You are most definitely female . Since birth . Good , now that we have our genders straight ... what can you tell us about this car theft organization ? - Hello . - Sorry . Well , I 've been after these guys for quite some time now . And I 've yet to get a specific line on their operations . So I know they got to have a headquarters somewhere , right ? Some kind of drop for all these hot cars . Someplace where they can remove the serial numbers , change the paint jobs . - You have no idea where this drop is ? - No . They always manage to just slip away from me . Like today . But this time I know the buyer . An ophthalmologist , Dr. Samson . They concentrate primarily on classic cars ? Classics , antiques , refurbished old sports jobs . Do you know there is a billion-dollar business just on stolen parts alone ? Samson would pay over a $ 100,000 for that Rolls . And even more if they could get him a Duesenberg instead . And the man behind this ring ? Another big question mark . Unless you subscribe to the theory that all crimes fit ... the personality of the perpetrator . In which case , our man ... number one , is a gambler , a businessman . Efficient , well organized . And someone in touch with big money . Sam , what are you doing to me ? Sell short . Yes , short ! Yeah ? Hold on . And buy the June bellies 10 minutes before the bell . Go ahead , I 'm listening . For 40 acres ? All right . Brazil ? Arbitrate and call back . Wondering , maybe we can get a hold of a Duesenberg ? We can give it a try . Sounds like you have a plan , Inspector . Best plan since Hannibal crossed the Alps . - Brilliant ? - But risky . Now just one second . There you go , Doc . Over this way . This is the Man . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting , Dr. Samson , been one of those days . I 'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage , Mr ... As intended , sir , my identity remains a mystery to my clients ... and all but my closest associates . As intended . You are prepared to fill my order ? The 1935 Laundalet ? For $ 100,000 in Swiss francs , drawable on a Swiss account , yes . Make it $ 75,000 . Split the difference , and allow me to keep this . - A sentimental addition to my collection . - Done . Why quibble ? There must be hundreds of ladies like her . It looks like this one ... but the lady we 're after is very much one-of-a-kind . And more important to Uncle Sam than the cars are to the police . Please remember that , Inspector , in case your plan works . You can have your lady . All I want is the Man . - You ready , partner ? - Yes . Just a minute . Neither of you are quite ready yet . Diana , I have a lovely broach for you . It 's a tiny microphone , pick up every word you say . - I guess I 'll have to watch my language . - I certainly hope so . This is for you , Inspector . - A ballpoint tape recorder . - Clever . - And that ? - And don 't forget your camera . And remember , Inspector , you are Arnie Lippincott . Small time thief with big ideas . Excellent ! How are your eyes ? Funny you should mention it , they 've been bothering me lately . " L-P-E-D . " Now what do you see ? I see 1935 Rolls-Royce Laundalet . - I beg your pardon . - No , wait ... it 's an SJ-type Duesenberg . A Duesenberg that a certain ophthalmologist has been looking for . I 'm afraid I don 't know what you 're talking about . I know that you 've been putting out feelers for ... a 1934 SJ-type Doozie . With dual windshields , front and rear ... dual side mounts , body by Rollston ... powered by the original supercharged straight eight . You can get one for me ? You never really wanted that Rolls-Royce , did you ? Not if I can get a 34 SJ-type Doozie . Yes ? Samson didn 't show to pick up the Rolls . Could be cold feet . - Could be competition . - Yes , could be . Do you know what to do in that eventuality ? Yeah , I know what to do . Sure do . Hi . - Dr. Samson , Arnie Lippincott . - Shall we ? Let me drive her . No driving , not until the trade is made . - Tomorrow , I 'll have it for you tomorrow . - Then it 's settled ? We trade straight across , this Doozie for the Rolls . Any day . Then that lady will be happy to take you for a drive . There isn 't going to be any trade . Brilliant . But risky . You had an appointment with a Rolls remember , Doctor ? But I gave him better merchandise at a better price . Well , the trade 's off . And I 'm taking the Doozie to boot . - Just for wasting my time . - Oh , no . Go for them , baby ! - Its okay . You 're a thinker , not a fighter . - A thinker ? If brains were rain he couldn 't make a drop . Let 's go , wise guy , you 're not out of the woods yet . Steve , I take it you heard what just went on back there ? We didn 't get the Rolls , but they did take Bolt with them , just like you figured . So I 'm going to take Dr. Samson down to the police station ... for a little chat with our friend , Lt. Cline . Then I 'll be in . Sounds like you 're putting on weight , Alfie . You know , Lippincott ... you 'd look like what 's on my plate if I had my way . Don 't tell me you 've gone and lost your way now . First a Duesenberg , then a fight , and now your way . You better watch out , Alfie , next thing you know , it 'll be your job . You know that sound ? Yeah , I know that sound . If you don 't want to hear the one that follows ... lay off of me . You bet . Your credentials have been checked , Mr. Lippincott . - Passed inspection . - Naturally . So what do you want from me now ? Not much , actually . Simply instruct your female associate ... to deliver that Duesenberg into my hands . Your hands ? My foot , that 's my Duesenberg . Keep your greasy meat hooks off it , whatever your name is . My impetuous friend ... - that Duesenberg is worth $ 200,000 . - I know . Don 't think for a moment you won 't die if I don 't get it . You can 't mess with Arnie Lippincott ... my boys will be all over you like green on grass . How colorful . But we both know , your midnight auto supply is a one-man operation . No , with his chick it makes two . And she 's not going to miss you . Okay , I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to make you a deal . You are going to make me a deal ? Right ... Excuse me , this happens all the time . I got it . Is this , by any chance , part of your deal ? A Packard insignia . So what ? So , I just happen to have a line on ... a 1937 Packard , 12-cylinder Roadster Coupe . - And ? - And it 's yours . If you two guys will let me out of here alive ... and in one piece . Not particularly interested , Mr. Lippincott . But , by some strange some coincidence ... I do have a buyer for a 1929 Mercedes Phaeton . Totally restored and original . Well , if anybody in this world can find one ... - it 's Arnie Lippincott . - He 's full of it . Why don 't you let me waste him ? By this weekend , Arnie Lippincott . For 20 % , whatever your name is . A capitalist after my own heart . - Twenty percent it is . - Done . And my insignia ? - Of course . - Thank you . I wouldn 't give him 20 % of nothing . I 'd make him 100 % dead . If he can do as he says , I can use him in the organization , Alfie . After all , you haven 't come across with much recently . However , until he passes this little test ... he 's still on the expendable list . You better get 100 % on this test , kid . Alfie , don 't you think it 's about time we took this blindfold off ? It might look a little less conspicuous . - Yeah , go ahead , take it off . - All right . - You look better with it on . - You 're cute . What 's the matter ? I forgot to tell you , this car is hot . Terrific . Don 't worry , nobody catches Alfie . - Put up the windows . - Are you out of your mind ? Put them up . - Get out ! - Get lost ! Either get wet or get a bullet through that fancy shirt of yours . Since you put it that way . - Come on . - What about the car ? - Let them have it ! - You are out of your mind ! Let them have it . - It 's the cops . - Just act natural . Easy for you to say . You 're used to being all wet . I 'm going home , get some dry clothes . Hello . - What hit you , a tidal wave ? - Would you believe a car wash ? It looks like you went through it without a car . - I did . - Why ? - Because it was hot . - The car wash ? - No , the car . - Right . - Did you get photographs ? - Yes , got some pictures . Just open your palm . - And do we have a tape recording ? - That 's in this pocket . Lift that cylinder off . There you are . Did you by chance get any fingerprints ? Even got those . They may be a bit damp ... but with the waterproof protective coating ... there shouldn 't be too many smudges . Great , pretty soon we will know who your man is . And with any good fortune we will also have your lady for you . Who could ask for more ? - Just one thing . - What ? The car that is described on that tape recording . Well , we 'll work on it . It may be a good idea if you went down by yourself first . I got a shadow lurking around here somewhere ... it wouldn 't be a good idea for him to see us together . Your shadow is here , cop . Alfie 's going to want to talk to you real bad . Let 's go . Slow . Help ! Where you going ? Somebody , help ! " Interfering females " ? Look after him , will you ? You 're the wizard who gives flying lessons without a plane ? Under the spell of my lasso you have to tell the truth . - Who are you ? - Who is your boss ? - Who are you working for ? - Alfie 's my boss . He owns the car wash . What does this Alfie do with stolen cars ? I don 't know nothing about stolen cars . I 'm just a cashier . When I release you , you will forget everything that 's happened . You blew it . I couldn 't help it ! He gave me the slip . I 'm just a cashier , man . Yeah . Where have you been all this time ? - I don 't know . - Never mind , his car is here . He 'll be back . Slim , you got that thing ready for him ? Yeah , it 's going to be ready . I don 't think Lippincott is going to cut into my territory anymore . But , by some strange coincidence ... I do have a buyer for a 1929 Mercedes Phaeton . Totally restored and original . The I.R.A. C computer has analyzed the fingerprints . - Have you got an ID yet , Ira ? - Patience , Steve Trevor . " Patience , Steve Trevor . " How is it coming ? When do you want it to go off ? - When Lippincott 's in the car . - I know that , Alfie . This is a heat-activating timer . It 's used by all the big-time hit men . Say the temperature in the engine ... runs at a 180 degrees for 10 minutes , then ... blooey . Ten minutes sounds good , as long as it goes blooey . Don 't worry about blooey . Suspect is Fiskle , Otis B. Businessman , investor . Speculator , swindler . He has amassed two separate fortunes With illegal schemes ... and subsequently lost them in legitimate enterprises . Sounds like he 's working on his third fortune in stolen cars . Where can we find him ? Also convicted of swindling pension money ... from retired citizens in nursing homes . Real nice guy , but where is he ? His record gets increasingly despicable . Ira , why do I get the impression you 're stalling ? - Who , me ? - Yes , you . Now where is Otis Fiskle ? He always hides his operations in unexpected places . If you don 't know where he is , why don 't you just admit it ? The I.R.A. C computer is unaccustomed to admitting failure . Well , you still have a chance to redeem yourself . Have you located the 1929 Phaeton described on the tape ? Affirmative . There . You see ? You 're still good for something . All right , let me have it . The sooner Inspector Bolt gets that car from Fiskle ... the sooner he can get us to that hood ornament . Just admiring your wheels . What are you doing , Alfie , looking for a new job ? By the way ... what happened to that shadow of yours ? You lose him , too ? You 're real cute , Lippincott . Where 's the M ' Sedan you promised me ? - You mean you got it ? - Of course . - Well , where is it ? - I 'm going to tell you ? You think you 're going to swipe that car to get in good with the Man ? Just doing what the Man tells me . No matter , the car is mine . Says who ? Look over there , turkey . Says him . Now tell me all about my new car . - You got the keys . - Yes . What a way to spend a Sunday morning . Mr. Chatsworth wasn 't keen on the idea of letting us pretend to steal his car . So , if anything happens to it ... he 'll have my head , neck , arms , and possibly my firstborn child . Those are going to make this the easiest car theft in history . What did Inspector Bolt have to say ? I couldn 't get a hold of him . I thought he would be here . What do you mean " Uh-oh " ? He may be taking matters into his own hands . You mean he 's hotwiring Mr. Chatsworth 's car ? He said he 'd do it , if we didn 't get the keys to him by the time he needed them . I better get to that antique car with these before he does . Or else Mr. Chatsworth is going to be very unhappy . To say nothing of me . I 've got the best idea since women 's suffrage . Why not use the keys ? Surprise . You expecting someone else ? That 's a good girl . What happened to Lippincott ? He got all tied up . Why are you tying me up ? Because I don 't want him to get lonely . - Where are you taking me ? - Out to lunch . So get in . Lou , get down here , I may need your help . Diana 's in trouble . We 've stopped somewhere , I can 't tell where . We 're in a car wash ... but we seemed to be going down in an elevator . Get a hold of Inspector Bolt 's Detail Command . There 's got to be a way to reach him . Boss ? Alfie . I got the car you wanted . About this guy Lippincott , he 's useless . Had to do it myself . Okay . Trevor calling Lippincott . Trevor calling Arnie Lippincott . I 'm getting numb , Shadow , why don 't you untie me ? Not until Alfie gets back with the special Phaeton . Then king me . Shut up . Arnie Lippincott , where are you ? Do you read me ? - What 's that ? - Come in , Arnie . Urgent message for Arnie Lippincott . Lippincott , come in , please . Over . Shadow . I guess it looks like you better do ... exactly what I tell you to . You 've got enough classics here to start your own auto show . That 's a familiar looking Rolls . 1935 Laundalet ? You ought to be a used-car salesman . Cute . What happened to the hood ornament ? Boy , you 're a nosey broad . But if you must know , the boss took it for a souvenir . - Terrific . - How nice . Trevor ? This is Lippincott calling , come in . - Lippincott ? - Yes , Colonel , I 'm still here . That last idea of yours , how good was it ? Best idea since Hannibal crossed the Alps . - Brilliant ? - But risky . It is you ! Listen . They 've got Diana . - Where ? - I don 't know . She says she 's somewhere in a garage full of classic cars . Under a car wash . You have any idea where that might be ? No , I don 't . But , wait a minute . Wait a minute , it 's a long shot but I 'd like to try Alfie 's car wash , anyway . I suggest you get a few men down to the garage and body shop on Grafton Avenue . - Grafton . I 'll be there . - I 'll check with you later . Out . Don 't go away , Shadow . Inspector ? Bolt ? Yes , Colonel , I 'm still here . Diana indicated she 's been transferred to a green four-door Sedan ? A green machine , got it . Matter of fact , there 's one coming in right now . I 'll keep an eye on him and move when they do . Let 's hit the road . We 'll monitor on the way . Help ! Help , somebody . Nobody answers at the garage . I got a bad feeling about that guy Lippincott . Yeah . Like cop fever . I wonder who he really is . Doesn 't matter , he ain 't going to cause us any trouble . Yeah , why ? Because if he 's running in that car of his . Blooey . Remember ? You 're strange . Do you hear that , lady ? Your boyfriend 's going blooey . " Blooey " ? A bomb . Inspector Bolt , this is Trevor . There may be a bomb in your car . Repeat , a bomb ! Get out immediately . Over . Bolt , bail out now . Sorry , Colonel , I haven 't got a parachute . That 's an order ! Not till I find out where they 're taking her . Out . - Fiskle ? - That 's correct . I found the hideout . It 's a farm on Oak Creek ... about four miles east of County Line Road . Bolt , are you out of that car yet ? I 'm getting out right now . I 'm going to follow them on foot . Out . Blooey ! Bring her over here . Quickly . Take the top off this thing . Maybe you got rid of my partner ... but that won 't stop the others . Will you take it easy ? Hold it ! That 's about enough horsing around . Lou ? Here 's another one to add to your collection , Colonel . Meet the Man . Nice work , Bolt . All right , Fiskle , where is Diana Prince ? She 's right here . Alive and well . Which is more than I can say for some people . Find another car wash , Inspector Bolt ? - Won 't have to take a bath for a month . - But you got your man . Yes . I did that . Now maybe we can find your lady . There 's a button on the bottom edge of that picture frame . - There 's your lady . - Yep . - I 'll take it . - Okay . The E-COM-PHAZE missile plans . Touted by military intelligence as being the most deadly system yet conceived . Now we can go forward with a defense system to neutralize it . Yeah . Thanks to you two . That 's us . The best team since Mickey and Minnie . - That good ? - The best .

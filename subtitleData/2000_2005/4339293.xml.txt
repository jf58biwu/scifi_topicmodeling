 Futurama [ 5x06 ] - Less Than A Hero - CiWaN Your call is being- - Connected . By SewerCom . Reach out and touch the sewers . Look , Morris ! It 's Leela calling ! Hi , Mom ! Hi , Dad ! Ready for your big trip to the surface ? We 're excited , honey , but we don ' t want to embarrass you . I mean , your mother and I are basically monsters . Dad , relax . You are being so mutant . I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head . And it was on sale ! No one 's wearing anything adorable over their head . Now listen . I could never , ever be ashamed of my parents . I 'll see you this weekend . Hey , guess who I just got off the video phone with . No ! My parents ! They 're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday . Are you off your rocket ? Your parents are mutants . It 's illegal for them to come above ground ... Because they 're inferior genetic scum . Present company excluded , of course . I 'm getting them a special one-Day surface permit from city hall . While you 're there , could you get me a license to kill ? Sure . Bare hands or weapon ? What does piano wire count as ? Good news , anyone . The Swedish robot from Pi-Kea is here with the super-Collider I ordered . Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap . Let 's see what tools we 'll need . Uh-Huh . Uh-Huh . Uh-Huh . All right , we 're all set . Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one 's own hands . There . Finished . And only six missing pieces . Those Swedes know how to put in almost everything you need . Man , I 'm sore all over . I feel like I just went 10 rounds with mighty Thor . I feel like I was mauled by Jesus . I 've got just the thing . Genuine miracle cream ... I bought from a traveling salesman . " Come one , come all ! " He said . " Step right up ! " " This sounds too good to be true , " I thought . He said I looked like a smart young man ! " So is it a deal ? " I inquired . Two hours later , he was gone with 60 of my dollars ! But I had the miracle cream . Bad news , nobody . The super-Collider super exploded ! I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack ... And some of those rancid meatballs . Excuse me . Hi . Do you have a minute ? I live in Jersey City . My car broke down , and my aunt 's sick . She needs this medicine , but I need bus money , so I 'm mugging you . Hand over your wallets ! I don 't believe that story for a second . It doesn 't matter , I 'm mugging you ! There 's no bus to Jersey City . Give me your wallets now , or my robot will shoot ! Don 't make me hurt you . I 'm too scared to find my pocket . Here , I 'll just take off my pants and give you those . Hey ! I don 't like what I 'm seeing ! Give it to him , Andrew ! Give it to him again , Andrew ! What the- - ? Laser-Proof shirts , huh ? Well , I 'll show you ! Hey ! Quit it ! Foiled . And after years of planning . You 're out of the gang . How did we manage to survive ? What gave us those strange powers ? Maybe we 're wearing magic rings , but they 're invisible So we don 't even realize it . Also , you can 't feel the rings . Fry ! Shut up and look at this ! " May cause super powers in humans . " Wow ! A super-Powers drug you can just rub into your skin ? You 'd think you 'd have to freebase it . Let 's see , which powers do we have ? " Super strength " ? Yep . Lickity speed ? Check . Yes , sir . Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures . Hey , Zoidberg , get in here ! Screw you ! Ain 't got that . Nope . Wow ! Super powers ! I 'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activities . Leela , I think you 're missing the big picture . When you were a kid , what was your biggest fantasy ? To have parents . Whatever . The correct answer is , to be a superhero ! We have super powers , and we 're Americans . This is our chance . Hm . I have been looking for a way to serve the community ... That incorporates my violence . Let 's do it ! You 'll barely regret this . Hey ! A friend of mine said he mugged you today , and you had super powers ! It 's true . Thanks to this funky-Fresh cream . Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-Fighting duo ! Wow ! Crime fighting ! Cool ! You say you 're a duo ? Yeah , duos are good . Of course , sometimes they 're a little short-Handed . See you . With two humans , you 'd think there 'd be a robot in there to balance things out . But whatever . I have these three costumes you could use , but I guess I 'll just throw one away . We 'd love to have you on the team . But aren 't you more on the supply side of crime ? Plus , the cream won 't give you super powers . You 're a robot . So ? I 'm already super strong , and my arms do this : Also , I got this going : Listen up , New New York ! There 's a new group of superheroes in town ! And we 're- - Quiet ! It 's 4 a.M And I just fell asleep for the first time in 30 years ! Sorry ! A new era of justice has begun . What ? Attention all crooks , lowlifes and lawbreakers . Do yourselves a favor and crawl back into your filthy tenements ... You human cockroaches , or get your ugly face punched to custard by ... The New Justice Team ! Captain Yesterday ! Clobberella ! And Super King ! The best one of the three ! Yow ! Ta-Da ! Captain Yesterday , I find your skintight high-Waters incredibly sexy . Let 's get together sometime . Sure ! I 'm listed in the phone book , so once I reveal my real name ... Along with my address and a copy of my birth certificate- - Are you crazy ? We have to keep our secret identities secret . From everybody ? Especially from everybody ! Give several reasons why . For one , superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage ... And we don 't want to get our butts sued . Or do we ? No , I guess not . Also , if our identities get out , every crook in the city will be after us . Or , God forbid , our loved ones . Super King has no need for loved ones . How you doing , kid ? There you go . Two one-Day mutant surface passes . Thank you , Mayor Poopenmeyer . Mayor here . What 's that ? A horrible crime in the works ? Ruthless villain ? Citizens in danger ? That 's fantastic news ! Because I get to summon the New Justice Team ! Shh . They 're usually here by now . Well , so long . Keep in touch . Wait ! Stay and meet the superheroes ! There 's three of you and three of them , so it 'll be perfect ! Is this clown on ? Where are those daring crime-Stoppers ? Oh , I completely forgot ! I left my apartment on fire ! As for me , I 'm late for my LSATs . And I can 't take life anymore ! Clobberella ! Captain Yesterday ! My liege . You 're just in time . We 've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History ... Will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9 a.M. The target : the priceless Quantum Gemerald . Who 's the perp ? A dangerous villain known as the Zookeeper ... Who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly trained animals ! Pack of highly . Got it ! His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose . An elephant who never forgets to kill . And a seldom-Used crab named Lucky , a.k.a. Citizen Snips . You can count on us , Mr. Mayor ! Justice away ! Hold the elevator ! We 're in here too . Leela , how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow ? We 've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9 a.m. foiling at the museum . Not a problem . I 've cleverly arranged to meet my parents ... Right there at the same museum at 10 . Nine , ten , a big fat hen . The name 's Bender . I can 't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist . It 's just rude ! Total hell ! It 's 10 ! I 'm supposed to meet my parents , and I 'm still in my secret costume ! There they are ! How can Leela not be here ? Do you think she forgot ? Relax . I 'm sure she 's just ashamed of us . Yo , freak jobs ! Hit the nearest manhole , pronto-Like ! But we have passes that allow us to be up here . From the mayor himself . I don 't know . I never heard of no mayor . The Zookeeper ! Sorry I 'm late . Long story . Now , everybody hit the deck ! I 'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit ! You 're not stealing anything ! Nobody hit the deck ! Ah , the superheroes . Or should I say , super zeros ? That was uncalled for . Animals , attack ! Please do not feed the animals ! You 're going down , my friend ! Down under ! Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle . But a kangaroo boxing a robot ? Now I 'm afraid you 've lost me . Citizen Snips ! Nice job , Fingers . I 'm scared and confused . I think we wandered into an off-Broadway play . No , there are way too many people here . Later , if anyone asks when I got away , tell them right now ! Forget it , Zookeeper . You 're going into captivity ! Fool ! A quip about putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious ! Here , catch ! No , Fry ! You can 't fall fast enough ! I got it ! I got it ! I don 't got it ! You saved the Gemerald ! Yet the Zookeeper escaped , thus proving that the deadliest animal of all ... Is the Zookeeper . You can get off me anytime . Oh , no ! My parents are leaving ! I 've gotta go change back into street Leela . It 's the New Justice Team ! Thank you , mysterious heroes ! The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater ... Than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum ! A net gain for our great city ! It 's good that Leela doesn 't love us . She 'll be less sad when we die . Ow . Mom ? Dad ? I showed up ! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace 's Tomb ! Sweetie , it 's okay . You don 't have to apologize for standing us up ... On the only visit to the surface we 'll ever have . I want to tell you why I didn 't show up , but I can 't . Just please believe me that it was a very good reason . I 'm sorry I disappointed you . Leela , you could never disappoint us . We 're so proud of everything that you are , and we always will be . Because you 're our baby girl . Oh , I can 't take it ! Mom , Dad , I 'm Clobberella ! Galloping gators ! You 're a superhero ? Well , that 's wonderful ! But did you have to make the costume so revealing ? Look at me ! Proud dad of a superhero ! We should print up T-Shirts ! And F-Shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side ! No , listen , it 's very important that you never , ever tell anyone ... Under any circumstance . What if I 've had a few ? Dad , you drink ? No , not even then ! All right . My sucker is sealed . In fact , I shouldn 't even be wearing this around here . It was brisk . I dressed in layers . That 's my girl . So anyway , my daughter 's Clobberella . Leela is Clobberella ? You 're pulling me ! Keep it under your sock . It 's a big secret . That 's why I 'm only telling you two . Oh , my God ! That guy 's daughter is Clobberella ! But don 't tell anyone . Gotcha ! Greetings , superheroes . Remember me ? I don 't remember much , buddy ! And you 're no looker . Professor , isn 't it time for your nap ? Yes , damn it ! Zookeeper , how did you know our real identities ? Let 's just say a little bird told me . Leela told her parents . Leela 's parents blabbed . Leela ? Ls the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy ? Yes . My parents were so hurt , I couldn 't help it . But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone . We are not amused ! And here 's something you may or may not find interesting . Mom ! Dad ! Leela , please forgive us ! Especially your father , who 's the one who told . Thank you very much , Morris ! Are you all right ? Has he hurt you ? No , but my allergies are going nuts . Oh , God ! Every couch and table has animal fur all over it . He lets them climb on everything ! All right , Zookeeper , what do you want ? Why , the Quantum Gemerald , of course . You must steal it for me by midnight ... Or your parents will be devoured by piranhas that I have , shall we say ... Persuaded to walk on dry land . Save us , Leela ! I mean , if you don ' t have anything better to do ! We 're out of options . We have to steal the Gemerald . But should superheroes commit a crime ? Even to save lives ? I need moral guidance ! Bender ? The thought of stealing anything fills Super King with disgust . But if it must be so , then let a museum heist be pulled ! Oh , no ! Our super-Power cream is out of itself ! Check inside the cap . There might be a caked-In gold mine . El Zilcho . I 'm afraid we 're boned . El Zilcho . Hey , is it too late to change my superhero name ? Just be cool . Nobody knows we 're super-Powerly challenged . Man , this costume is so damn heavy . Hey , Captain Yesterday ? Can I , like , wail on you with this two-By-Four ... And it doesn 't hurt you ? Ow ! That didn 't hurt . Hi , superheroes . Everything okay ? Big O , little K , my friend . Just checking if everything 's all right . It 's okay , all right . Okay , then . Grab it ! Yo ! The superheroes have turned evil ! Most uncool ! Get them ! Stay back , or we 'll beat the tar out of you using super powers ! Whoo-Ooah . So this is your lair ? Of course not ! You think I 'd show you my lair ? My lair 's a million times nicer than this . Okay . Take it easy . Well , here 's your lousy Gemerald . Hawk , fetch ! That seemed unnecessary . Our transaction is complete . Come , Solomon , to the lair ! Mom ! Dad ! Oh , I 'm so sorry I got you kidnapped ... By a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas . We 're just happy to be involved in your life . No , no , it 's my fault ... For telling you I was a superhero . That 's true . I just couldn 't stand to have you think I was ashamed of you . That 's sweet , honey . But it 's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents . Oh , yeah . Just like it 's natural for parents ... To be a little disappointed in their children . Not that we are . But you could call a little more often . Okay . And would it kill you to use some mouthwash ? Hey , Fry , we 've still got our costumes on . Wanna steal some more stuff ? I guess . As long as you think it 's right . Superheroes away !

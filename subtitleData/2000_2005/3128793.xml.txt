 They say most of your brain shuts down in cryo-sleep . All but the primitive side the animal side . No wonder I 'm still awake . Transporting me with civilians . Sounded like 40 , 40-plus . Heard an Arab voice . Some hoodoo holy man . Probably on his way to New Mecca . But what route ? What route ? Smelled a woman . Sweat , boots , tool belt , leather . Prospector type . Free settlers . And they only take the back roads . And here 's my real problem : Mr. Johns , blue-eyed devil . Planning on taking me back to slam only this time he picked a ghost lane . A long time between stops . A long time for something to go wrong . Why did I fall on you ? He 's dead . Captain 's dead . I was looking right at him . The chrono shows we are 22 weeks out . So gravity was not supposed to kick in for another 19- - - Why did I fall at all ? - Did you hear what I said ? Captain 's dead . 1,550 millibars . Dropping 20 mb per minute--Shit ! We 're hemorrhaging air . Something took a swipe at us . Just tell me we 're still in the shipping lane . Just show me all those stars . Come on ! Those big , bright- - What ? This is an emergency dispatch from merchant vessel , Hunter Gratzner , en route to the Tangiers system with 40 commercial passengers on board . We have been knocked out of our shipping lane and are currently entering the atmosphere of a planetary body in the following position : X-38-stroke-5 Y-95-stroke-8 , Z-21- - Fry , where the hell 's our comms ? Rate of descent beyond known limits . Rate of descent beyond- - Hey , they trained you for this Fry , right ? Deploy lower air brakes now . - Deploy lower air brakes now . - Center of gravity too far aft . Recommend purging ballast now . What the ... . Was that a purge , Fry ? Too heavy in the ass ! Can 't get my fucking nose down ! Crisis program selected Number 2 in the system because it shows some oxygen . Maximum terrain : 220 meters over mean surface largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporite deposits . Fry , what the hell are you doing ? I gotta drop more load . Look , I tried everything else . I still got no horizon . You gotta try everything twice ' cause no way that we just flush out the- - Look , If you know something I don 't , get your ass up here and take the chair or- - . Listen , company says we are responsible for every single one of those people , Fry . What , we both die out of sheer fucking nobility ? Don 't you touch that handle , Fry ! I 'm not gonna die for them ! - Air lock doors not secure . - Owens ! 70 seconds , Fry ! You still have 70 seconds to level this beast out ! - damnit ! shit ! SHIT ! SHIT ! - Air lock doors not secure- - Air lock doors not secure . Air lock- - What the fuck is happening up there ? - Imam ? ... Imam ? - ... Zeke ? Somebody 's gonna get hurt one of these days . It ain 't gonna be me . Here , Shazza . So , I guess something went wrong . I 'm sorry . Get it out of me ! Don 't touch it ! Don 't--Don 't you touch that handle ! - Leave it alone . - Get it out of him . No , No , No . It 's too close to his heart . There 's some Anestaphine in the med-lock in the back of the cabin . Not anymore there 's not . Get out of here . Everyone . Get out of here . Teach me for flying coach . Interesting . Is anyone else having difficulties breathing ? Yeah . I feel one lung short . All of us . I feel like I just ran or something . There was talk of a scouting party looking for other people , but--then we saw this . What the bloody hell happened ? Could have been a meteor storm . Might have been a rogue comet . - I don 't know . - Well , I for one am thoroughly grateful . This beast wasn 't made to land like this , but I think you did well . Actually , the only reason we 're alive is because of her . Yes , I suppose you 're right . Thanks very much . Yeah . Thanks for saving our dicks . No , really . Thanks awfully . Well done . He just escaped from a maximum prison . So , do we just keep him locked up forever ? Well , that would be my choice . - Is he really that dangerous ? - Only around humans . I 'll bet the whole container 's upside down , it 's all--it 's all topsy-turvy . Well , thank goodness it 's not a total loss . Booze ? This is what you have to drink ? I 'm gonna need a receipt for that . For all of these . This is my personal stuff . I don 't suppose this will help you at all . Unfortunately , it is not permitted . Especially while on Hajj . - You realize there 's no water , don 't you ? - All deserts have water . - It only waits to be found . - I hope you 're right . All the more for me then . Motherfucker . What the hell are these ? They 're Maratha crow-bill war Picks from Northern India . Very rare . And this ? That 's a hunting blow-dart pipe from Northern Papua New Guinea . And that 's very , very rare , since the tribe is now extinct . 'Cause they couldn 't hunt shit with these things , would be my guess . Well then , what 's the point , anyway ? I mean , If the man is gone , he 's gone . - Why should he bother us ? - Maybe to take what you got Maybe to work your nerves . Or maybe he 'll just come back and skull-fuck you in your sleep . Sounds like a charmer . For you . There we go . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Imam ! If we 're looking for water , we should leave soon . Before nightfall , while it 's cooler . Ali . Excuse me . I think you should see this . Three suns ? Bloody hell . So much for your nightfall . So much for my cocktail hour . We take this as a good sign a path , direction from Allah . Blue sun , blue water . Ever wondered why I 'm an atheist ? It 's a bit of a bad sign . That 's Riddick 's direction . I thought you found his restraints over there . Towards sunset . Right . Which means he went towards sunrise . Zeke . Fully-loaded clip . Safety 's on . One shot if you spot him , okay ? Don 't tell me you 're going off , too . What happens if Mr. Riddick spots us first ? There 'll be no shots . Quiet ! Seven stones to keep the devil at bay . Sorry . So , did you see anything ? No Riddick . Trees ... trees mean water . You comfy up there ? Yes , well , its amazing how you can do without the necessities of life , - provided you have the little luxuries . - Just keep your bloody eyes open . I don 't want that dog sneaking up on my bloody ass . Yes , well , you dig the graves . I 'll hold the fort , old boy- - - Christ ! - He 'd probably get you right here right under the jaw , and you 'd never even hear him coming . - Because that 's how good he is . - Tell me something , Did you run away from your parents or did they run away from you ? It 's a communal graveyard , perhaps . Like the elephants of Earth . He asks what could have killed so many great things . Is this whole planet dead ? Drink ? Probably shouldn 't do this . Dehydrates you even more . You 're probably right . You know , you could 've stayed back at the ship . Probably should 've . We don 't find water , you know what happens . I wanted to get away . I 've never seen a captain so ready to leave her ship . - I think we should keep moving . - What did Owens mean about not touching the handle ? This is between you and me , Carolyn . I promise . I 'm not your captain . During the landing when things were at their worst , Owens was at his best . He 's the one that stopped the docking pilot from dumping the main cabin . - Passengers . - And the docking pilot being ? I guess I 'm a little more glad to be here than I thought . Hassan ! Suleiman ! Captain . Is there anyone here ? There was water here . Lights ? Lights on ? ... Okay . They are saying , " God is great . " Yes . This is the source of the water . No darkness . No lights because no darkness . Hello , Mecca ! Tell me that was you just now . What are you going on about ? He 's been right here helping me . Back of the ship . That noise ? You trying to tell me that was someone else ? No ! Oh , my God . I thought I was the only one who got out of the crash alive . It was just somebody else . It was just somebody else from the crash ! Crikey , I thought it was him . I thought it was Riddick . No juice . It looks like it 's been laid up for years . - But we might be able to adapt it to the- - - Shut up ! - Sorry , I thought I heard something . - Like what ? Gunshots . Dang ! Piece of shit ! What did you do to Zeke ? What did you do to him ? Just kill him . Just somebody goddamn kill him before he- - So , where 's the body ? Well , do you want to tell me about the sounds ? Look , you told Johns you heard something . That 's fine . You don 't want to talk to me , that 's your choice . But , just so you know there 's a debate right now as to whether we should just leave you here to die . You mean the whispers ? What whispers ? The ones telling me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine . Fourth lumbar down . The abdominal aorta . It 's a metallic taste , human blood . Copperish . If you cut it with peppermint schnapps , that goes- - Do you want to shock me with the truth now ? All you people are so scared of me . Most days , I take that as a compliment . But it ain 't me you got to worry about now . Show me your eyes Riddick . You 'd have to come a lot closer for that . Closer . Where the hell can I get eyes like that ? - Gotta kill a few people . - Okay . I can do it . Then you gotta get sent to a slam where they tell you you 'll never see daylight again . You dig up a doctor , and you pay him 20 menthol Kools to do a surgical shine job on your eyeballs . So you can see who 's sneaking up on you in the dark ? - Exactly . - Leave ! Leave . Cute kid . Did I kill a few people ? Sure . Did I kill Zeke ? No . You got the wrong killer . He 's not in the hole . We looked . Look deeper . They 're hollow . I 'm in here ! I 'm in here ! I 'm inside ! I thought I heard something . Please ! Can you hear me ? I 'm in here ! I 'm inside ! Oh my God . Help me . Give me your goddamn hand . I heard you , Fry . I heard you first . - Fry , are you okay ? - Come on . - What 's down there ? What is it ? - Did you find Zeke ? - Fry , Are you okay ? - You 're all right . - Fuck ! - Okay . That was so fucking stupid ! I don 't know what the fuck is in there but whatever it is , it got Zeke , and it nearly got me ! - - Get it off me ! Get it off me ! - Get it off me ! Get if off me ! - Watch it ! Watch your head ! Finally found something worse than me , huh ? So here 's the deal . You work without chains , without bit , and without shivs . - You do what I say , when I say it . - For what ? The honor of going back to some asshole of a cell ? Fuck you . The truth is is I 'm tired of chasing you . Are you saying you 'd cut me loose ? I 'm thinking you could have died in the crash . My recommendation : Do me . Don 't take the chance that I 'll get shiv-happy on your wanna-be ass . Hey- - Ghost me , motherfucker . That 's what I would do to you . I want you to remember this moment . The way it could have gone and didn 't . Here . - Take it easy . - Fuck you ! Do we have a deal ? " I want you to remember this moment . " - Just one ? - For now . So , you click your fingers and he 's one of us now . I didn 't say that . But at least this way , I don 't have to worry about you all , ugh falling asleep and not waking up . - So , could I talk to him now ? - No . Blast ! Paris P. Ogilvie . Antiquities dealer , entrepreneur . Richard B. Riddick . Escaped convict murderer . Tha-That 's a particularly good Shiraz . It-It-It 's a lovely drop . It-It 's very expensive . By all means , please . Help yourself . All right , all right . My turn . There we are , we 're gettin ' there . So- - We 've got enough power for a sys-check but we 'll still need more cells . How many are we talking about ? Ummm ... Let 's see , we got a 90-gig draw . The other ship takes 20-gig cells , so that 'd be five . Five total to launch . Thirty-five kilos each . Well , that 's pretty heavy . You know that old sand cat out there ? I might be able to get it going . Yeah , do it if you can . But if you need a hand Where 'd Riddick go ? Let 's go . You 're missing the party . Come on , boy . " Missing the party . Come on . " All praises be Allah , for his many blessings to us . What ? It 's the winner of the look-alike contest . - Who were these people , anyway ? Miners ? - No , looks like geologists . You know , an advance team , moves around from rock to rock . Nice of them to leave so much stuff here . Why did they leave their ship ? It 's not a ship . It 's a skiff , and it 's disposable really . It 's more like an emergency life raft , right ? Yeah , they probably had a big drop ship take them off planet . These people didn 't leave . Come on . Whoever got Zeke , got them . They 're all dead . You don 't really think they left with their clothes on the hooks ... - ... Photos on the shelves ? - Maybe they had weight limits . You don 't know- - I know you don 't prep your emergency ship unless there 's a fuckin ' emergency . - He 's fuckin ' right . - Watch your mouth . Hey , he 's just saying what we 're all thinking . So what happened ? Where are they ? Has anyone seen the little one ? Ali ? Has anyone checked the coring room ? - Ali ? - Jack , wait , wait . Ali ? ... Ali ? Ali ? Ali ? Imam ? Imam ? Other buildings weren 't secure . So they ran here . Heaviest doors . Thought they 'd be safe inside . But they forgot to lock the cellar . Whatever the fuck those things were , they seem to stick to darkness . So if we stick to daylight , we should be alright , okay ? - Let 's go . - Twenty-two years ago . What ? These coring samples are dated . Last one 's 22 years ago , this month . OK , is there something special about that , Carolyn ? I don 't know . There could be . An eclipse . You 're not afraid of the dark , are you ? So we got to get the power cells . - Shit , I 've still gotta check on the hull- and patch the- - - Wait on the power cells . What , wait for what ? Until it 's so dark , we can 't even - find our way back ? - You don 't know when it 's gonna happen , - So let 's not get over excited . - Just get the fucking cells here Johns . - What , What is the discussion ? - Maybe I should tell you how Riddick escaped . - He can pilot ? - Yeah , he hijacked a prison transport . Made a hell of a good run before I tracked his ass down . Okay , Okay , Maybe that 's a good thing . Maybe we can use him to help us navigate or something . He also figured out how to kill the pilot . Look , you told me that we could trust him . You said that we had a deal , Johns . Now , you may have noticed , but chains don 't work on this guy . Now , the only way you people are truly safe is if he believes he 's going free . - Now , let 's just say he stops believing- - - You mean , if he realizes that we 're going to royally fuck him over . Now , I want you to just listen to me for one second . If we bring the cells up at the last possible minute when the wings are ready , when we know we 're ready to launch- - You know , he hasn 't harmed any of us . As far as I can tell , he hasn 't even lied to us . - Let 's just stick to the deal , Johns . - He 's a killer ! And the law says he has to do his bid . There is nothing I can do about that . You hear me ? You 're dancing on razor blades here . I 'm not gonna give him a chance to grab another ship . Or slash another pilot 's throat . Not on my watch . Bad sign . Shaking like that in this heat . - I thought I said no shivs . - Shivs ? This ? This is just a personal grooming appliance . Thanking you . Looks like we 're a few shy . Power cells . They 're coming . It 's strange , not doing a run-up on the main drive yet . ... Unless ... Unless he told you the particulars of my escape . I got the quick-and-ugly version . Now , you 're worried about a repeat of history . It has entered our minds . I asked what you thought . You scare me , Riddick . That 's what you want to hear , is it ? Now , can I just get back to work ? I 've been meaning to catch up with you alone . Unrestrained . You think ? ... You think Johns is a do-right man ? You think I could trust him to cut me loose ? Why ? What did you hear ? Well ... I guess if it were " trickeration , " he 'd just ... " X " me out , huh ? He 'd kill me . Then again I am worth twice as much alive . Oh , you didn 't know that ? Your Johns ain 't a cop . He 's got that nickel-slick badge . And that blue uniform . But he 's just a merc . And I 'm just a payday . That 's why he won 't kill me , see ? - The creed is greed . - Don 't waste my time . We 're not gonna turn on each other , no matter how hard you try . I don 't truly know what 's gonna happen when the lights go out , Carolyn . But I do know , once the dying starts this little psycho-fuck family of ours is gonna rip itself apart . Ever wonder why Johns shakes like that ? Ask him . Ask why your crew pal had to scream so painfully before he died . So who are you really ? You 're not a cop , are you ? I never said I was , Carolyn . No , you didn 't . And you never said you were a hype , either . You have a little caffeine in the morning and I have a little morphine . So what ? Here you got two mornings every day . Wow , you were born lucky . - It 's not a problem unless you 're gonna- - - No , it becomes a problem when you let Owens die like that ! You have enough drugs here to knock out a fucking mule team . Owens was already dead . His brain just hadn 't caught on to the fact . Is there anything else I should know about you , Johns ? - Yeah , well , look to thine own ass first , - right Carolyn ? - Captain ! Captain ! I 'm not your fucking captain . What do my eyes see ? If we need anything from the crash ship , I suggest we kick on . That sand cat 's solar . - Where 's Riddick ? - Leave him ! He wouldn 't wait for us ! I thought we 'd lost you . Johns ! Where are you going ? I 'm just gonna get a couple of things . Now , let me get a few minutes . You wouldn 't leave without me , would you ? Just give me another minute . Shit . How many are there ? Beautiful . Allah ! People , just a suggestion . perhaps you should flee ! - Let 's go ! - Come on , run ! Shit ! Come on ! Get in . Get down ! No . No . No . You gotta stay there ! - Stay down , Shazza ! Stay down ! - Come back here ! Shazza , stay down ! Please , I really think we should go inside now . We have to be inside to be able to close the door . Come on , let 's go ! go , go , go ! What is it Riddick ? What is it now ? Like I said it ain 't me you gotta worry about . She should 've stayed down . If she only would 've stayed down , she 'd be okay . She wouldn 't die . You remember the boneyard ? These just might be the fuckers that killed every living thing on this planet . What are we gonna do now ? Are these the only lights we have ? Is this everything ? No , there 's a cutting torch on the floor here , somewhere . I just can 't find it . Quiet please , everyone . Why do they do that ? Make that sound ? Perhaps it 's the way they see . With sound- - Could be a breach in the hull . Come on , Johns . You got the big gauge . I 'd rather piss glass . Why don 't you go fuckin ' check ? - I 'm not staying here one more second . - Where are you going ? Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! - Paris , Paris ! - Sit him down . - Sit down ! - You don 't know what 's out there . - I know what 's in here . Hurry ! Now we 're trapped in a much smaller space , I hate this ! Extremely bad timing . Just don 't run . Riddick ? Don 't stop burning . - Take this . - Take that . Hassan ? Where is Hassan ? Is it alive ? - It 's like the light is scalding it . - It hurts them . Light actually hurts them . Is that Hassan ? We 'll burn a candle for him later . Come on , let 's get out of here . So we got one cutting torch . We got two hand lights . There 's gotta be something we can rip out of the crash ship . Spirits , anything over 45 proof burns rather well . - How many bottles you got ? - I don 't know , maybe 10 . Okay , Johns , you 've got some flares . - So ... Maybe we got enough light . - Enough for fuckin ' what ? We stick to the plan . We get the four cells back to the skiff . We 're off this rock . Look , I hate to ruin a beautiful theory with an ugly fact but that sand cat is solar . - It won 't run at night . - So we carry the cells . We drag them . Whatever it takes . You mean tonight ? With all those things still out there ? All right , Now , how long can this last ? A few hours ? A day , tops ? I had the impression from the model the two planets were moving as one and there would be a lasting darkness . These suns gotta come up sometime . And if these creatures are phobic about light , then we just sit tight and we let the sun come up . I 'm sure somebody else said that locked inside that coring room . We need to think about everybody now , especially the kid . How scared is this boy gonna be out there in the dark ? Don 't use him like that . - Like what ? - As a smoke screen . You deal with your own fear . Why don 't your fuckin ' mouth for two seconds and let me come up with a plan that doesn 't involve mass suicide ? I 'm waiting . How much do you weigh , Johns ? - What 's it matter , Carolyn ? - How much ? Around 79 kilos , to be exact- - Because you 're 79 kilos of gutless white meat , And that 's why you can 't think of a better plan . Is that fuckin ' right ? Where are you goin ' ? This solves nothing . Okay . They 're afraid of our light . That means we don 't have to be so afraid of them . And you are sure you can get us there ? Even in the dark ? No , I can 't . But he can . Stay close . Wait , Wait . Riddick . Looks clear . - You said , " Clear . " - I said , " It looks clear . " Well , what 's it look like now ? Looks clear . I 'll be runnin ' about 10 paces ahead . I want light on my back , but not in my eyes . And check your cuts . These bad boys know our blood now . Are we actually going to do this ? We stay together . We keep the light burning . That 's all we gotta do to live through this thing . Are you ready Johns ? Look , we 're just wasting light here . You give him the cells and the ship and he 'll leave you all out there to die . He 'll leave all of you . I don 't get it Johns . What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you 're worried about losing ? Is there anything at all ? Besides your next spike ? Stay close . Wait . Jack ! Jack ! This can 't be happening . This can 't be happening ! Paris ! Get back here ! Are you all right ? This can 't be happening . This can 't be happ- - I was supposed to die in France . I never ever saw France . Well , it 's good to see you 're okay . Do I even want to know ? Are we gettin ' close ? Can we pick up the pace ? You want to tell me what the hell 's goin ' on ? - We crossed our own tracks . - Why have we circled ? - Are we lost ? - Listen . - Do you even know where we are ? - Listen ! Canyon ahead . I circled once to buy some time to think . - I think we should go now . - I don 't know about that . That 's death row up there . - Especially with the girl bleeding . - What ? Fuck are you talkin ' about ? She 's not cut . Not her . Her . You gotta be kidding me . I just thought it 'd be better if people took me for a guy . I thought they might leave me alone instead of always messing with me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , sweetie . Are you really bleeding ? You could 've left me at the ship Fry . That 's how come I didn 't say something sooner . They 've been nose-open for her ever since we left . In case you haven 't noticed , they go off blood . Look , this is not gonna work . We 're gonna have to go back . What did you say ? You 're the one who got us out here in the first place ... - ... and turned us into sled dogs . - I was wrong . I admit it , okay ? - Can we just get back to the ship ? - I don 't know , Carolyn . Nice breeze. wide-open space . I 'm startin ' to enjoy my fuckin ' self out here . What , are you high again ? Just listen to yourself , Johns . No , no , you 're right , Carolyn . What 's to be afraid of ? My life 's just a steaming pile of meaningless shit anyhow . So I say , " Mush on . " The canyon 's only a couple hundred meters and after that , it 's skiff city . So why don 't you butch up , stuff a cork in this fuckin ' kid and let 's go . She is the captain . We should listen to her . Listen to her ? When she was so willing to sacrifice us all ? - What 's he talking about ? - This ... does not help us , Johns . During the crash , she tried to blow the whole passenger cabin tried to kill us in our sleep . - Shut your mouth ! - We are fuckin ' disposable . We 're just walkin ' ghosts to you , aren 't we ? Shut your fucking blow hole ! Fine ! Fine ! You made your point . We 'll all be scared . ... Carolyn , how much do you weigh now ? The verdict 's in . The light moves forward . - Ain 't all of us gonna make it . - Just realize that ? Six of us left . If we could make it through the canyon and lose just one , That 'd be quite a feat , huh ? - Not if I 'm the one . - Well , what if you 're one of five ? I 'm listening . What are they doin ' up there ? They 're talking about the canyon , I suppose how to get us through . Battlefield doctors decide who lives and dies , it 's called triage . Kept calling it murder when I did it . Either way , I figured it 's something you can grab onto . Sacrifice play . Hack up a body , leave it at the start of the canyon like a bucket of bait . Trawl with it . You got extra cable on the sled . - We drag the body 40 , 50 feet behind us . - Nice embellishment . I don 't want to feed them . I just want to keep them off our scent . - So which one caught your eye ? - No , no , don 't look . Christ , what the hell 's wrong with you ? Imam , slow down . Just a little more space between us and them . All right , enough of this shit . You do the girl , and I 'll keep the others off your back . It 's not too big a job for you , is it ? I 'm just wondering if we don 't need a bigger piece of bait . Like who ? Leave the sled ! Let 's move ! Let 's go ! One rule . Stay in the light . Remember that moment ? Should 've never taken the chains off , Johns . You were one brave fuck before . You were really bad-ass . The chains . The gauge . The badge . I told you to ghost me . Back to the ship , huh ? Just huddle together until the lights burn out ? ... Get away from us . till you can 't see what 's eating you . That the big plan ? - Where 's Johns ? - Which half ? We 're gonna lose everybody out here . - We should 've stayed at the ship . - He died fast . And if we have any choice about it , that 's the way we should all go out . Don 't you cry for Johns . Don 't you dare . Blind spot . Shall we pray together ? I have already prayed with the others . - It is painless . - It 's pointless . Because you do not believe in God does not mean God does not believe in- - Think someone can spend half their life in the slam with a horse bit in their mouth and not believe ? Think he could start out in some liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck , and not believe ? Got it all wrong , Holy Man . I absolutely believe in God . And I absolutely hate the fucker . - He is with us nonetheless . - Two of your boys are already dead . How much faith do you have left , Father ? Only see one way , that way . It 's the only way off this rock . Just keep the girl between you . What about the cells ? I 'll take those . - Move . - Are you sure you can keep up ? Move ! Do not look up ! Do not look up ! They 're killing each other ! Move ! Keep moving ! Keep moving ! Riddick . Wait ! Riddick . Get off of her ! Get off her ! He did not know who he was fuckin ' with . - Come on , get him up . - Get up ! So , where the hell 's your God now ? Riddick ! Are we close ? Just tell me that the settlement is right there ! We can 't make it . Hide here ! Now ! Why is he still out there ? He 's not coming back , is he ? That 's the last I could find . Strong survival instinct . I admire that in a woman . I promised them , that we would go back with more light . Did you ? Hmmm ... What , are you afraid ? Ha Ha Ha ! Me ? Afraid ? Come on , Riddick . There 's gotta be some part of you that wants to rejoin the human race . Truthfully , I wouldn 't know how . Well then , just give me more light for them . I 'll go back by myself . Okay . There you go . Please , just come with me . I got a better idea . Come with me . You 're fucking with me . I know you are . You know I am ? You don 't know anything about me . I will leave you here . Step inside . - I can 't ... I cant ... - Sure , you can . Here , I 'll make it easy on you . Take my hand . Come on . Look , no one 's gonna blame you . Save yourself Carolyn . Come on . Come on . That 's it . That 's it . Good girl . Now , you ! You listen to me ! I am the captain of this ship . And I am not leaving anyone on this rock with those fucking things , even if it means- - - Get that thing off my neck . - Shut up ! - You 'd die for them ? - I would try for them . You didn 't answer me . Yes , I would , Riddick . ... I would ... I would die for them . How interesting . I never had a doubt . Anyone not ready for this ? There is my God , Mr. Riddick . Don 't stop ! Don 't stop ! Come on ! Move ! Go ! You know the way ! On board . Come on . Get on . Carolyn . Come . Now . Wait . Riddick . Riddick ? Okay , hold on to me . Hold on to me . We 're gonna get out of here . Okay , I got you . Come on , Riddick ! Get up ! Get up ! Get up ! I said I 'd die for them , not you . Let 's move , come on . Come on . Alright . Not for me . Not for me ! With so much prayer to make up for I scarcely know where to begin . I know where I 'd start . Riddick , what are you doing ? Can we just get the hell out of here now ? We can 't leave without saying good night . A lot of questions , whoever we run into . It could even be a merc ship . So , what the hell do we tell them about you ? Tell them Riddick 's dead . He died somewhere on that planet .

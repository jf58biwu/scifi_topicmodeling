 Directed by Moon Seung-wook Hurry up and let 's go . Let 's begin . I 'm looking for my family ... Wait , let me start over . I was sent off to an orphanage as a child . I don 't know my real name or age . I don 't even remember what my family looks like . I wasted too much time at the lost-and-found . The guide and I must 've missed each other . My bags are missing , but I forgot what I even packed . I won 't look for my bags again . I 'll have to get used to letting things go now . After my father passed away , my younger sister and I moved to Germany where my mother worked as a nurse . I was born in this city . But everything has changed since I left . And none of my memories remain here . You 're No. 1 5 right ? Yes , there we are . Can you speak Korean well ? We 're late so shall we go ? My name 's Yuki . I 'll be your virus guide . Yuki 's a pretty name , huh ? It 's Japanese for 'snow falling from the sky ' . Was it Anna ... ? Anna Kim , right ? Anna 's a nice name too . Oh yeah ! My last guest was also an Anna , but she was American . She said her name came from the Virgin Mary . So what do we do now ? Yes ? Right ... where are your bags ? Yuki ? How do you do ? It 's our car from the travel agency . Any luggage ? None . Shall we go now ? How can you make such a stupid mistake ? You sent the wrong person . What ? Yes ? Are we headed for the hotel now ? No , we 're going right to the virus . The virus is always on the move so we can 't waste time . Just a minute . All right . Take care of it fast . Bye . To Gonghang-dong . Okay , get in . What are you doing ? Come on , it 's on our way anyway . Ride-sharing is forbidden during tours . We don 't have time to lose . Yes , get in . Didn 't you hear what I said ? No ride-sharing ! What did you just say ? Anna , let 's find another ride . Hey , get back in ! You know how important this is ? An idiot like you could never know . Anna , are you all right ? Hang on . You saw the butterflies , right ? They 'll guide us to the virus . Just hang on a bit longer . Trust me . Hello ? Is this Mr. Kim ? What 's going on ? Yesterday you said it was fine . It 's the first broadcast ... Yeah , I 'm watching it now . Do you know how important this is to me ? Hello ? It 's not even a commercial so why should I pay more ? That 's not what you said before . Okay , I 'll give you more if you give me more air time . What ? ! Hey , why is the picture so dark ? And what 's wrong with the audio ? Anna , where are you ? Anna , where are you ? Can you hear me , Anna ? Anna ! Yuki ? Lie down . Relax and lay your head down . Are you pregnant ? How many months ? Seven months . I 'd like a new guide . Anna , wait ! I can still guide you ... Yes , all right . What about the virus ? What about the virus ? I said where is the virus ? Are you listening to me ? Why did you bring a passenger here ? Can you take care of her for me ? You got caught again . How many times did I tell you to rest ? If the agency ever finds out ... Just this once ! Keep my name on and do this for me just this once . Another group is on the way ! Why should I keep helping ... ? That 's why I 'm begging you . You know that I need money ! I said no . I 'm sorry . Please wait one more day . How about another along the way ? To the Plaza Hotel . Get in . Man , it 's cold . Thanks . This is a real old photo . Must be looking for someone . My dad used to be a cab driver too . He put his graduation photo there to find his old classmates . Did he ? Excuse me ? So did he find his old classmates ? He met one all right . He turned out to be a crook . Do you mind if we take the Manduk tunnel instead ? No , it 's still under construction . Well , the other drivers go anyway . Anyway , it 's strange . When you try hard to meet someone , it always ends badly . I really think there 's such a thing as bad karma . You should be careful finding that person . Looking for someone can be dangerous . Get out . What ? Sorry . I can 't drive because of your babbling so get out . What are you doing ? I have other passengers in the back so get out ! Is this some practical joke ? Get out . What 's the matter with you ? I told you I 'm not going so get out . What do you think you 're doing ? The ladies in the back are waiting so go ! Don 't shove me ! I said go ! I 'm not taking you ! I can 't believe this asshole ! I have other passengers waiting ! Then why did you let me in ? You shouldn 't have run your mouth ! You started first ... Just get out of here ! I told you not to shove me , asshole ! Yeah ? So what ? Is this your car ? Damn right it is . - This your car ? - Yeah . Ass hole ! You fuckin prick ! You wanna die ? Then why did you let me in ? Why did you kick my car ? You 're the one who said to get in . You better get outta here ! Anna ! Where are you , Anna ? Anna ! Anna ! Where are you , Anna ? Anna ! Where are you , Anna ? Anna 's gone ! Damn it ... Yuki ! Yuki ! Yuki ! I 'm from the travel agency . Are you all right ? It 's dangerous to be out here at night . Please take me to my hotel . I 'm very sorry . If he hadn 't distracted me while I was driving ... Who did the police take away back there ? They 're lead poisoning patients . The city quarantines them because of the tourists . Those filthy bastards ! They 're just like drug junkies . I wish the government would get rid of them all . They 're not bad people . I heard glass beads tinkling . I saw them take away this one girl and ... Pull over . I said pull over ! What 's the matter ? Are you okay ? What 's wrong ? Could you leave us alone for a minute ? You 're running a high fever . You need to go to a hospital . No , I 'm fine . If I rest a little , I 'll get better . What 'll be better ? Don 't you care about your baby ? Are you out of your mind ? I wanted to show you a miracle . Don 't you get it yet ? My baby worked a miracle for us . This young guide reminds me of the memories I try to forget . I traveled far to erase my painful memories , but like a fool I 'm still where I was . Yes , hello ? This is the travel agency , right ? Yes , this is car No.8 , working for guide No.15. Oh , is this the team manager ? Yes , how are you ? I hope everything 's fine with you too . Well , I 'm calling to discuss something with you . Hey ! Anna , please wait ! Hey ! Hey ! It 's about the guide . She 's strange . The way she acts ... Yeah , well I wouldn 't say that . She 's acting like one of those lead poisoning sickos . Hey ! Hey ! What 's going on ? How could you get us in such a mess ? Hey ! Hey ! I feel into a deep dream . I dreamed about something . I returned to my childhood , and cried loudly in my mom 's arms . My mother caressed and soothed me . I cried more and then fell back asleep . Anna , come in . You don 't seem pregnant at all . I 'm going to have my baby in the water . I heard it 's less painful and good for the baby too . Anna , you had a baby right ? How come you didn 't give birth in water ? Are you all right ? Are you all right ? Are you okay ? Why 'd you want to see me ? Is Anna all right ? I 'm going to get the car washed . I 'll be back soon ! Is this the public health office ? Yes . I 'm a driver for the virus tour . Yes , I have a question . About the lead poisoning people . Well , what do you do when you find one ? Yeah , I 'm looking at your website now . I got hurt riding my bike . The gash wasn 't too bad at first so I didn 't worry . But later it festered a lot . So I had surgery not long ago . Doesn 't it hurt ? Only if I run real hard . Doesn 't it hurt , Anna ? What does ? I saw the scar on your stomach . The baby died in my stomach . The remains uncovered at the Misung construction site belong to those reported missing in last year 's floods . Due to a typhoon with acid rain , a search was cancelled at first . A few more searches were resumed later , but as construction continued the searches were broken off . Victims ' families called for an immediate stop on construction as well as an excavation of the site for more bodies . Really ? Are you sure ? Okay , I owe you one . Thanks . Anna . They 've found a new virus guide to fill in for me . It 's a good friend of mine so don 't worry . And also . I 'd rather the travel agency didn 't know if that 's okay . Thank you . We can 't end our last day together like this . Wanna have a good time with me today ? I 'll show you some fun . The first time I saw the ocean , I sat all day long on the beach just looking ... It was real nice though . You 'd expect the water to be just blue , but it 's sort of like the sky . The color changes every hour around dawn . I thought it 'd be black at night , but it wasn 't . Do you know why ? Give up ? The light from 41 fishing boats made the water violet gray . Can you imagine ? Just call it plain gray instead of that fancy color . It looks like the sky ... If I pass this line , it 's okay , right ? Yeah , you gotta tag me and run . Okay , okay . Green light , red light ! Come on , that 's cheating . No , I 'm safe . Green light ! Try getting used to them . Sneakers are better than those hard heels . Sometimes these are more comfortable . They 're great . They look nice and comfortable . A bit too big ? It must be the wrong size . I saw a perfect pair earlier . Where were they ? Oh , here it is ! How do you like them ? Actually , I had my heart set on them . But since I like you so much Anna , I 'll sacrifice . Beige looks nice on you Anna . I really think so . Anna , I think you 've got a colorful streak in you . I knew we 'd like the same things . Well , they 're not exactly the same ... But you 're wearing my clothes , right ? They 're cute . How much are these ? It 's a present . This place is very different from the place where I live . I thought that I forgot everything about this city , but it vaguely reminds me of the past . I was always a stranger in Germany . However , I 'm part of all the many people here . They look alive . I got a nickname for it . Slinky noodles . Try it with this . It 's yummy . We 've got enough for breakfast tomorrow . This is the first time anyone 's made a meal for me . Is this something you ate often as a child ? I probably won 't make this ever again . It 's delicious . Really ? Regarding the remains uncovered at the Misung construction site , there are many stories surfacing . One person found his missing brother after 1 0 years , and couldn 't hide his sorrow . Clear skies are likely for the day , but many clouds at night . Anna ! It 's okay , I know the way out . I almost forgot to thank you . This is the first gift I 've ever gotten . Wait , I have something to show you . She 's an old friend of mine . She wanted to catch the virus and forget the past like you . What you 're seeing now is part of her faded memory . She wanted to forget everything , but I think she hoped someone would remember her pain . So I kept her memory for safekeeping . Just like her , some people searching for the virus want to erase everything . These are their passports . I can understand them . They want to be cleansed I guess . Keeping memories ... . I don 't understand . Like I did for her , I 'll hold onto your memories . You want to rid of them now , but you might want them back someday . I don 't want to keep the pain . Anna , I 'll never forget this day ! Shall I take you to your hotel ? Let go of me ! Don 't worry . They came from the hospital . What for ? She 's sick , that 's all . What 's wrong with her ? Help me ! Please help ! Help ! It 's no good getting in their way . Wait . It 's nothing , don 't worry about it . Wait , let me go first . The customer l called about is here . Well , go talk to the team manager . What is it ? The customer l called about is here . Why did you bring her in here ? Can 't you take care of anything ? You told me to ... Tell her we 'll cover the hotel since our guide screwed up . And don 't bother me like this ever again ! Well , you 'll receive a new guide tomorrow . And since it 's the company 's fault , they said they 'll pay your hotel bills . Shall we go now ? Look here ! I know she 's just a girl , but how can you be so insincere ? You must 've gotten close to her . Did you know that she 's pregnant ? We can 't be responsible for all our guides ' personal problems . Shall we go ? That 's a really famous tourist attraction . Would you like to go ? I usually charge extra since it 's far , but ... Yuki became pregnant . She said it was a miracle . I call it pain . but she calls it a miracle . It used to be here . I 'll go ask someone . Excuse me . Are you all right ? Yes . Since it got too crowded , they said they moved it to Jungang Church . It 'll open in the morning . Shall I take you to your hotel ? I 'd like to rest for a moment . Money 's everything , isn 't it ? What 's the hangup with money ? Do you mind if I smoke ? Go ahead , sir . Sorry , I 'll have just one . Please be careful with the light . Okay . That 's what happened ... . Discipline at school these days ... If you hit a kid at school ... . 62470804 Kim Sung-nam , 67807824 Moon Gi-il , 54207823 Park Seo-won , 72480164 Kang Ri-na , and 72341057 Jung Mi-sook . This is the missing people list and their DNA number . Inquiries and information on the DNA can be found on our website . Do you have any idea how long it 's been ? Are you listening to me ? Pull over . Pull over ! I was sent off to an orphanage as a child . I don 't know my real name or age . I don 't even remember what my family looks like . My only hope is to meet someone who recognizes my picture from the orphanage . If someone recognizes the boy in the photo , they might know me or my family . After leaving the orphanage ... Why are you showing me this ? I keep taking other passengers hoping someone might recognize me in the picture . I 'd appreciate it if the travel agency didn 't know about this . Hello ? Oh , yes ... Sorry , we had some car trouble . Yes , everything 's fine now . Yes , hold on . It 's for you . Yes ? Where have you been ? You didn 't call after requesting a new guide . So how do you expect us to help you ? I believe that 's not my fault . I won 't tell the agency anything so just get me a cab . Look ... ! Just please get in , okay ? Get me a new driver tomorrow . I 'll take you back to the hotel so just get in . Let 's go , okay ? There aren 't any taxis here anyway . I 'm very sorry so let 's go now . Damn ... Let 's go , okay ? You won 't find a ride here . All right , do what you want ! I 'm leaving by myself , okay ? I 'm going so suit yourself ! Tell the agency for all I care ! I 'm really going ! I had it looked at a few days ago ... I 'll be just a minute . We can 't get far like this . We 'll have to stop near here for repairs . It won 't take long . Why don 't you look around a bit ? You can go in if you 're cold . The car 's all done . Wow , they must get real lightheaded doing that . Wanna try ? I 'm sorry . Why are you out in the cold ? Wanna run ? Huh ? Let 's run . Why did you run ? Thanks for going to the temple with me earlier . You 'll catch a cold with your damp clothes . Change into this . We 've got a long way to go so have some of this . Thank you . Do you always carry extra clothes ? Yeah , this car 's like home to me . This is good . Did you make it yourself ? No , I get them somewhere else . I got burned at the orphanage when I was a kid . So I 've stayed away from crowds ever since . Have you worked long at the travel agency ? No . Actually , this is my first assignment . The pay 's good . Do you believe in the ' oblivion virus ' ? I don 't believe in miracles or magic . Finding your family ... . ... wouldn 't that be a miracle ? Yellow dust is presently forming in China 's inland area . All citizens need to take precautions . Sanitariums for pregnant teens of lead poisoning is now a hot topic . The Health Dept. said it induces abortion for the teens ' health . But a civil group for teens asserts that the sanitarium forces abortions on the teens to prevent deformed babies . The civil group verified the truth from teens who escaped ... Flight K207 for Frankfurt is about to board . Passengers for this flight please proceed to Gate No. 4 . It 's me . Anna ? Where are you ? Did you forget you just got out of the hospital ? Don 't worry . I just need some rest . Anna . Call the publishers , and tell them I 'll hand over the translation by next month . And tell Christine I 'm sorry . And please look after mom for me . Mom can 't stand cold milk , so don 't forget to warm it up . Where are you now ? Anna ! Hello ? K207 passenger Anna Kim , please come to gate No. 4 . K207 passenger Anna Kim , please come to gate No. 4 . Anna ! Anna ! The sanitariums forced abortions on young lead poisoning patients . ... in order to prevent deformed babies . Yuki could die giving birth . It would be a miracle if Yuki survives labor . I used the last of my money to get Yuki out . In exchange , Yuki promised she 'd find me the virus . This is where I 'm going to live when I have my baby . I wanted to show it to you Anna . Won 't you live here with us ? We can fix up this cable car , and we 'll go out when we want . I ended everything by giving up my baby at seven months . Now Yuki is trying to pick up and start where I left off . Anna , let 's rest a bit . Yuki , you need to go to a hospital . You can 't hold out much longer . No , I can 't . You know what the doctors would do ... Stop it ! Stop talking nonsense ! You need medical care , okay ? The baby doesn 't ... You can have more later . Your life is more important . Do you trust me ? In response to the Misung construction , the victims ' families are continuing their protest . In order not to upset its building plan for a new town , city hall is holding steadfast to any opposition . There seems to be no easy answer to this problem yet . Wait . My water broke . Yuki ? Come on , go faster ! I want to have my baby in the sea . Take me to the sea , please . How could you run around when you 're ... ? Just hang on , all right ? We 're almost there so hang on a little longer . Stop the car . I said stop the car ! Why ? Where are you going ? Help me ! Hurry and come here ! Okay , wake up now . Open your eyes ! Come on , push . More ... ! A little bit more ! One more time ! I see it ! More ! One more time ... ! Wake up ! Open your eyes ! Yuki , look at me ! Don 't lose it . Yes , that 's good ... Once more . One more time ! I see the head ! I see it ! Yuki ! Wake up ! Stay with me ! Stay with me ! That 's it ! I see it ! It 's coming ! It 's coming ! Why did she keep all this junk ... ? It 's all useless ... Poor kid ... Anna , this looks like you . Just like her , some people searching for the virus want to erase everything . These are their passports . I can understand them . They want to be cleansed I guess . Customers are waiting so why can 't you keep to the schedule ? There 's a slight problem with the guides ... Could you explain this ? This is my first tour . But what 's my old passport doing here ? Excuse me . I 'm sorry , but I don 't know how I can help you . Can you show me the files of your past clients ? That 's not possible . I just need to check one thing . I need to know if I was here before . I said that it 's not possible . Mr. Kim ! Please , let 's step outside and talk all right ? I need to see those files . Yes , I understand . You do remember the waiver you signed right ? I just want to check ... We aren 't responsible for what happens after you get the virus . You know that already . I only want to see if I 've been to this city before . I know , but this waiver is for your own good , not ours . Do you understand ? I just have to know why I came to this city before ! Please leave . I have nothing more to say so leave . What do you think you 're doing ? I 'll ask you one more time . I need those files . I have to know about my past . Didn 't you come here to forget ? What 's the difference if you were here before or not ? That 's enough . You have nothing to gain by this , okay ? Please leave . What the hell are you doing ? Get her out of here . Let 's just go . I forgot to change the time on my watch . Being here , I 'm so far away . But I 'm still dwelling in the time of the place I left . I want to have a baby . I feel like I could start all over . I wanted to adopt Yuki 's baby , but I think you need him more . I hope you can start all over like me . Please get in . Is something wrong ? My bags ... You forgot your bags ? If you 'll wait a moment I 'll go back in and get them . That 's all right . Are you sure ? It 'll only be a second . I don 't need them . Watch your feet . And this is yours , right ? Here you go . Are you sure you 'll be all right ? Be careful of the door . It 's cold , isn 't it ? Did you lose something ? No , I 've got everything . I 'm sorry . No , it 's all right . Please feel free to tell me if anything is uncomfortable . That 's my baby boy . He 's adorable . He 's only two now , and he 's starting to talk . Is that your wife ? No . Just a friend . Like you , she came here to forget a past . I don 't know what she 's up to now . But someday , we 'll see each other again . The virus is always on the move so we can 't waste time . Shall we get going ? Okay ...

 The Sheyang vessel is about to fire . StarBurst ! StarBurst now ! Moya can 't . She isn 't ready . Zhaan . Zhaan , do something ! D 'Argo . He can help them . No , no , no . He can talk to them . No , no . Listen to me . D 'Argo ... D 'Argo is gone . No D 'Argo , no Aeryn , no Crichton . Just us , okay ? And in a few microts , we 'll be dead , too . No ! D 'Argo can save us . He can . He - he has to save us . They 're firing ! D 'Argo , we need you . D 'Argo ! Shake it off . Come on back . Get off the canvas . You can do it . Rise and shine . Up and at 'em . Break through . Man , this is getting old . Least you could do is talk in your sleep . What would you like me to say ? Whoa . How 'bout , ' Great to be back ' ? Was I away ? You sure as hell were . Days . I don 't know how many . I kinda lost track of time . Do you know who I am ? Yes , I recognize you , John , but I do not recognize this place ! Am I dead ? No . Am I dead ? No ! No . You 're not dead . I , uh , I thought we were dead . - Why aren 't we ? - Aeryn . She finally managed to scoop us up . Brought us here . Some ... asteroid . Abandoned mining camp . Factory . I don 't know . Something like that . Where is she ? She 's in the Prowler grocery shopping . This rock gets a 9 on atmosphere but only 2 on food and water . We have a lot to thank her for . Yeah . Prowler to Talyn . What delayed you ? You were supposed to check in two arns ago . I can 't always get away on schedule . Don 't forget , I still have to give Crichton some reason for my absence . He still has no knowledge of our ... arrangement ? - None . - It might facilitate matters if you explain to him ... - No . Eventually , you 'll have to . Only when it 's too late for him to interfere . You sure your memory 's okay ? How long was I without oxygen for ? Long enough to scare the hell out of me . What 's the last thing you remember ? Space . Kronite . Gammak Base aflame . Magnificent sight . Absolutely . Did Moya get away ? Moya did , but Talyn ... Talyn ? Yeah , Moya 's baby . Awful name . What happened to him ? Crais happened . He made off with the baby . - We should NEVER have let him live . - Yeah , I know . What happened to the Command Carrier ? It 's still in the area . Aeryn has spotted Marauders checking the asteroid field out , but they haven 't seen us yet . So now we evade Scorpius , and then we have to find Crais . Remove him from Talyn . Who the yotz named him Talyn ? I did . After my father . Aeryn , check out who finally woke up from his little siesta . - Yes , I have eyes , Crichton . - I have eyes , as well . And they are very pleased to see you alive . Hey , yo . What 's the matter ? Is there a problem ? All I managed to find was a little water . I 'll have to keep exploring . Look , if this asteroid is unsuitable , then we should all leave . - Good idea . Change of scenery . - No . This is the only asteroid I 've seen with structures that 'll hide you from the Marauder patrols . Yeah , but ... D 'Argo 's awake . We get out of the asteroid . We signal to Moya . She comes and she picks us up . We don 't even know if Moya 's in range , and we can 't outrun a Command Carrier , so we have to remain hidden until the carrier withdraws . - What if it never does ? - Well , Scorpius can 't look for us forever , and he can 't even be certain that you survived . Aeryn , Scorpius wants me pretty bad . His patience may outlast your Prowler 's fuel . When the Prowler 's fuel runs out , we starve . As John once said , ' I would rather go down on a swing . ' - Swinging . You wanna go down ... swinging . - Swinging . The only reason we 'll starve is if you don 't stop this useless discussion and let me keep searching for food . - This discussion ... - Aeryn ... Stop it ! Both of you ! If not for me , you 'd both be dead , all right ? So stop fighting me ! Rygel , eat ! I can 't eat . What , you ... you can 't eat ? What , any fever ? Or dizziness ? Or secretions that are even abnormal for you ? I 'm not sick . I 'm simply not hungry . Ask Pilot why . Bad news , Pilot ? Moya is returning to the asteroid field where she last saw Talyn . - What ? - There , you see ? Is Moya unclear on the concept of why we ran away ? She insists on searching for her offspring ... despite the risk . A Peacekeeper Command Carrier is slightly more than a risk ! Moya and I have chosen a course that should allow us to re - enter the field undetected . Even then , we 're flying back in unarmed , defenseless . We aren 't entirely defenseless . Huh ! As good as ! All we have is that antiquated defense screen we took from the wreck of the Zelbinion . This pile of dren ? Well , is it even functional ? I 'll have the DRDs give it a thorough going - over . Moya doesn 't understand your distress . Besides Talyn , we might also find Crichton , D 'Argo and Aeryn . If they could have gotten out , they would have by now . All patrols still report nothing , sir . Uh , no signal from the leviathan offspring . No trace of Crichton . Nothing . I comprehend the meaning of 'nothing ' , Lieutenant . After Crichton ejected from the transport , it may have been a mistake to pull back and allow that rogue Prowler to rescue him . - You had little choice , sir . - Oh , true . He would have chosen to perish rather than to be saved by us . But ... the Prowler ... eluded capture ... and continues to . In a field of this size , we may never find it . Time for a change of tactics . Talyn ! Stop this senseless behavior . Your mother has gone . Do you understand ? Moya has abandoned you . What are you doing ? Power down your engines at once ! Leaving the protection of the field right now is suicidal . I know you detest all this hiding . You 're a gunship . A warrior . You want to move , to fight . But you 're not yet strong enough to take on a Command Carrier . He 's going berserk . Talk to him . Talyn , what 's the matter ? Show us . There 's no reason to be afraid . I 'm here . So is Crais . Talyn , we want to help you . Please , let us see what 's upsetting you . Communications . Broadband transmissions . Random noises mixed with distortion spikes . Scorpius . Talyn , these signals mean nothing . They 're intended to alarm you and to make you run . Talyn , do not play into the hand of your enemy . Remain right where you are . You 're brave enough to do that , aren 't you ? Very good , Talyn . Talyn , excuse us for a moment . D 'Argo 's regained consciousness . He and Crichton are eager to leave . And don 't suggest that we simply abandon them , because that was not part of our arrangement . We can 't leave just yet . Talyn is still too immature . No weapons . No starburst . And he continues to ignore my commands . You can 't command a leviathan , you can only persuade . Talyn is part leviathan , part Peacekeeper . He was designed to take orders . Why don 't you let me talk to him ? Alone . No . I am willing to share command of Talyn . I will not relinquish it . - Again ? - Yeah ! One , two , three . - Again , I win . - No , I win . Paper wraps rocks . - No , paper cannot possibly beat rock . - It does . Paper beats rock . Rock rips through paper . D 'Argo , that 's not how it works . Paper beats rocks . - That 's unrealistic . - Well , it 's the rules ! And it 's not supposed to be realistic , it 's supposed to be entertaining . - My coma was more entertaining . - It 's a kid 's game . Aeryn , good hunting ? - Should we give you a hand ? - No need . - It 's no problem . What did I say ? I don 't need any help . You know what ? I think you do . I 'm certain you do . This is ridiculous . I have a question . How many times have we saved each others ' lives ? I 've lost count . - Safe to say more than once ? - Sure . Right , and how many times have you and I been close ? Just the once . Oh , no , no , no , not that way . Oh . Um . Friend close . Yes . Um . Uh , uh . More than once . Yeah , right , well , whatever our relationship is , we should be in a place where we can trust one another . I think you 're holding something back . Look me in the eye . Look me in the eye . Tell me that I 'm wrong . You 're not going to like what I have to say . Mmm . Maybe not . In order to save your lives , I had to make a deal with Crais . - What ? - S - slow down . Stop . You had to what ? By the time I retrieved you , Moya had gone , you were both about to suffocate . And then Crais signaled me from Talyn with the coordinates to an oxygen - atmosphere asteroid . This asteroid ? I never would have found it on my own . Not in time , anyway . Back up . What 's your end of this deal ? When Moya left , Talyn got upset . Stopped obeying Crais . I agreed to help calm Talyn down , and teach him to start obeying Crais 'orders . Oh , boy . Makes sense . You 're - you 're helping Talyn obey the guy who ... kidnapped him ! - I didn 't have another choice ! - You should have let us die ! - No I couldn 't have . That offspring has weaponry ! And you put that weaponry within the grasp of Crais . Oh , what would you prefer , D 'Argo ? That Scorpius gets Talyn ? Or destroys Talyn ? - Right now , even Crais 's control is better than no control at all . - Right now ? Okay , when exactly is that gonna change , Aeryn ? After Crais has brainwashed him , he 's gonna give him back ? I told you you wouldn 't like what I had to say ! - I don 't ! - Neither do I ! Yeah , well , it 's all we have . No it isn 't . All right . We cannot allow Crais to remain aboard Talyn . Do you agree ? Absolutely . She 's gonna be pissed when she gets up , though . It was a time - saver . You look after her while I go and break Crais 's neck . D 'Argo , you couldn 't break wind right now . I 'm going . I owe Crais . You think I don 't owe him ? Shoot for it . One , two , three . I 'll see ya . Zhaan ? It 's me . Hello ? It 's me . Chiana ? Look , I hate to disturb you while you 're so busy ... well , not that I understand what you 're doing ... I mean , I understand it 's part of the Delvian Seek thing so you can become a priest again , or something . But I don 't see how it works . Not that it 's my business . You have thirty microts . Moya 's got some fahrbot idea about going back into the asteroid field to look for her baby even though we 'll surely get captured by Peacekeepers and I don 't have to tell you what happens then . So I was wondering if you could talk to Pilot so he could talk to Moya to convince her that this bad idea is , well , a bad idea . Did you get all that ? Yes . So you 'll do it ? No . You 've killed all three of us , now . Without Crais and Talyn 's help , we 'll never get out of here alive . Do you really think that Crais would return us to Moya once Talyn is under his control ? His word is worth next to nothing . He no longer considers himself a Peacekeeper . Or so he claims . I believe him . He knows Scorpius would have him executed . Oh , then his conversion doesn 't mean much , does it ? Well , perhaps not , but he is a fugitive just as we are , which means that his goals and ours may no longer conflict . If he has deserted the Peacekeepers , then his loyalties lie only to himself , which makes him more dangerous . Not less . Locking scramble security three velka . Please ... confirm . Scramble confirmed . Proceed . - The gunship is still ... - Not my concern . Where 's Crichton ? Officer Sun won 't tell me yet . Building her trust is time - consuming as is building the gunship 's trust . The latter task is made no easier when the gunship is panicked by your spurious transmissions . Your progress report was overdue . I concluded you were incapacitated and I attempted to retrieve the gunship . Then it is among your concerns . As a means to recovering Crichton , no more . Deliver Crichton to me , and I will allow you to keep the gunship . Demonstrate some of the formidable patience you are always bragging you possess . My patience is formidable , Crais . But it is not infinite . Talyn , you heard Scorpius . You are not his concern . Merely a tool he can use or barter away . This is how the Peacekeepers treat their own : you , me , Officer Sun . But we are alike now . Orphaned from all we ever knew . We have only one another to rely upon . You must believe me . Trust me . Crichton . I ... I know . Sorry . You know , I shoulda called , but I was in the neighborhood , thought I 'd drop in . Say hi . How ya doing ? Where is Officer Sun ? Have you harmed her ? You 're asking me if I 've harmed Aeryn ? That 's a winner , Crais . Do sebaceans have a word for " chutzpah " ? What do you want , Crichton ? Oh , a couple of things . Your head on a platter , for starters . I 'm unarmed . You can kill me easily . Be warned , however , Talyn regards me as a friend . Interesting . I heard that you had a long way to go in that department . I have . Nevertheless , I believe he would react badly to my death and retaliate by killing you . Oh , well but , if you 're dead , he 's out of your clutches . Fair price to pay , I 'd say . Consider this : neither of us wants to see Talyn in Scorpius ' hands . Okay , I give . What do you want , Crais ? Simply to escape . To travel deeper into the Uncharted Territories . To re - examine my path . You want to have a mid - life crisis ? Fine , just ... ditch the firm , head off to Maui , shack up with the super model , but you do not get to keep the Porsche ! You don 't get the keys to Moya 's baby . Talyn , intruder . You 're about to lose your head . Now tell Talyn to put away the toys . Talyn . Now open the hatch . We 're gonna go for a little drive . Wha ... Pilot , what the yotz was that ? Moya is accelerating . I know that . I felt it in all three stomachs . She heard a transmission from Talyn . He 's in the asteroid field , apparently in great pain . I 'll try to find out more . Moya 's in full lunatic mother mode . She 'll blunder right into Scorpius ' bad teeth . That - that ... module thing of Crichton 's is still operational . We could let Moya go on without us . Hmm . We could . Not that any planet in this vicinity was very hospitable . Pilot and ... Pilot and Moya didn 't abandon us during Zhaan 's trial . We can 't ditch . We gotta stick . Stupid though it may be . There is a transport pod available should you not wish to accompany us . What ? Leave you and Moya ? No . We - we couldn 't . Could we ? No . Oh . We 'd never consider such a thing . This transmission can be only one thing : a leviathan distress call . And if Moya is anywhere in the area , she should come running . If the gunship does not emerge from the asteroid field , if Moya joins her offspring in concealment , we have gained nothing . Nearing the origin of Talyn 's transmission , but there 's no sign of Talyn . He may have fled further into the field . Any other ships around ? No . Wait ! - A Prowler . - Has it seen us ? Apparently , it 's changing course to intersect with ours . It 's been a thrill , your frogness . May your afterlife be almost as pleasant as mine . This is odd . The Prowler has not initiated any communications . Not sending word home ? No . In fact , it 's maneuvering as if it wishes to dock . You don 't think ? No . It couldn 't be . Pilot ? Let it dock ! - Chiana ! - Chiana ? Yo , Chi , what up ? Stay where you frelling are ! How do I know it 's you ? You wanna check my birthmarks ? Yeah , maybe . Uh . Why didn 't you signal ? 'Cause the bad guys might be listening . Okay , so , uh , so what are you doing with him ? What , this guy ? Putting this guy back in his cell . You survived ! Hey , don 't I always ? Hey , Blue . Zhaan . Hey , darling , can you hear me ? Certainly I can hear you , John . I can always hear you . Uh huh . You okay ? Perfectly . You 're not ... surprised to see me ? Not at all . I apologize for shouting at you , John . Yeah , that 's okay . Uh , when exactly was that ? On Litigara . I accused you of not being there for me . I realize now that ... that wasn 't true . Liti ... gara ? Don 't think that I 've been there , but I 'm here now . Yes , your spirit is with me . The flesh is unimportant . No , it 's kinda important . Whoa ! Oho ! Whoa . I 'm not dead . She thinks I 'm dead . I 'm real . Yes , John . You always will be , to me . Mm . What do you ... help ? Zhaan thinks nothing 's wrong . She 's resumed the Delvian Seek . Whoa whoa whoa ... you tell me this is supposed to be normal ? Oh , you tell me . You 've seen more Delvians than I have . You think that 's a help ? Tie . We 're low on food . I 'd conserve your energy , if I were you . For what purpose ? To live longer . If I am to die on this asteroid , I would it were sooner than later . Besides , if I die , you can eat me . You don 't look ripe to me . Somebody call for a taxi ? Crichton , you succeeded ? I 'm one for two . I 'll give you the details on the way back . Crichton , you must return now . Moya 's made contact with Talyn . Where is Talyn ? About to leave the asteroid field . We 're on the way , Pilot . There is no mistake , sir . The gunship is leaving the asteroid field , and Moya is pursuing . Follow them . But stay well clear of their sensor range . They must not see us until they are too far from the asteroid field to hide again . But we won 't be able to catch the leviathan if she starbursts . She won 't because her offspring can 't . On my signal . Cripple both ships . Commando units will take Crichton alive , but I care for no other prisoners , clear ? Sparky ! How 's my favorite Hynerian ? Even I 'm pleased to see you . Are , uh , are you not well ? You got a frog in your throat ? You need a Hynerian heimlich ? Fine . I 'll be fine . Slight case of the intons . What ? It 's a Hynerian airway seizure caused by very strong emotions . I didn 't know you had strong emotions in you , Sparky ! Other than , uh , greed , of course . A simple reaction to the shock of seeing you again . It is good to have you all back aboard . - We missed you too , Pilot . - Very much . - What 's Talyn 's status ? - Highly distraught . He continues to flee and won 't even acknowledge Moya 's signals . Pilot , I might have a little more luck . Is Moya willing to let me try ? Moya consents . You may proceed . Thank you . Talyn , this is Aeryn . Please answer . Talyn , you don 't have to run from Moya . She only wants to protect you . Talyn , I know you 're confused . You 've heard so many voices but you know that I care about you . At least let me know that you can hear what I 'm saying . Hey . You might want to give it a rest . Poor kid 's confused . He doesn 't know who to listen to . Moya 's still trying to catch him , which can 't be helping matters . No . Look , I 'm gonna go have a chat with Pilot . I 'm sorry , Commander . Moya refuses to allow Talyn to get further away . Look , look , look ... does she not realize that by chasing him , she 's making him more nervous ? She 's convinced she can still get through to him and talk him down . Having found him , she 's terrified at the thought of losing him again . I know . I know . It 's her kid . It 's her kid . I know that . I know that . Maybe mom does know best . There 's no sign of the command carrier , right ? None . Yet . Zhaan ? Hello , Aeryn . Come in . Crichton said you were chanting . Um . Are you finished yet ? I 'll never be finished . This is a different phase of the Seek . Fine . Well , I just wanted to see how you were . I love you . You what ? I love you . Oh , yes , I did hear it the first time . And you know what ? I ... I ... I love all living beings . The Seek has reopened my eyes to the wonder of the spirit . I am now going to devote my life to enlightenment . Oh . Well , I think that 's , um really selfish , actually . You know , before you bliss off completely into oblivion , you might want to have a little look around you , because Moya and Talyn are in danger . Worldly concerns do not interest me now . Oh , really ? Well , then don 't give me any dren about how much you love me . Love in it 's most rarefied sense- - Too rarified for me . I 'm just an ignorant warrior who believes that love means you are willing to fight and die for your fellow living beings . You 're an atypical Luxan , Ka D 'Argo . You left your military service to raise a family upon a rural planet . Spare me your disapproval . I don 't . I lived upon a farming community until the Peacekeepers conscripted me . My wife was a sebacean . Tell me you approve of that . No . I find it repellent . That reaction ... the concept of irreversible contamination ... was instilled in me by the Peacekeepers . As such , it needs to be questioned . Re - examined . A containment cell is a fine place for reflection . True . Pa 'u Zhaan achieved much during her incarceration . But I cannot stay here . Talyn needs me . Too frelling bad . Your hatred of me , though well - earned , blinds you . I can keep Talyn out of Peacekeeper hands . And I will . You 're not getting back aboard Talyn . Get used to the idea . Re - examine it . I shall . Before you were ... arrested , were you happy ? Happier than you can ever imagine . Then I envy you . Both the leviathans are decelerating . Either they have no plan whatsoever , or they 're about to implement one which isn 't immediately apparent . Our wisest move in both cases is the same . Overtake and engage . Well , don 't take your time , or anything . You 're sure it 's the command carrier , Pilot ? Yes , closing fast . Firing range in 6 , 000 microts . Scorpius . He just can 't live without me . Talyn sees the carrier . He 's powering up his main cannon . Excellent . Have him aim dead amidships , right in Scorpius ' ... He 's aiming for Moya . Damnit ! What the hell 's he doing ? Talyn says that was a warning shot . He 's sending Moya a demand . - What 's he want ? - A captain . Talyn 's afraid . He doesn 't know what to do about the approaching command carrier . Oh , like we do ? He insists he needs guidance . Ouch . Let 's get that boy some guidance before he turns into a full - blown Menendez brother . I 'll go at once . Talyn demands that we send over Crais . What ? - He said he wants Crais ? - He can 't have him . Pilot , get that boy on the phone . He is unwilling to discuss it further . He says he 'll fire upon us unless we agree to return Crais now . Pilot , evasives . Moya won 't . She doesn 't believe he 'll fire . Pilot , let 's get that defense screen up just in case mama 's wrong . Done . But it may not hold . Man . Haven 't you people ever heard of fuses ? Moya 's unhurt , but the defense screen is out . No , really ? And another shot would do Moya considerable harm . Scorpius will be upon us in no more than 5 , 000 microts . I 'm going to take Crais to Talyn . And then what ? We leave Talyn in Crais 's control ? His and mine . I 'll stay aboard Talyn with Crais . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! For how long ? For as long as necessary to protect Talyn . He 's very intelligent , John . Once he matures , he 'll no longer want a Captain . Yeah , Aeryn , in the meantime ... I 'll be there to mitigate any damage that Crais does . - Crais is never gonna go for that . - Yes he will . He 's already offered to take me with him . And you 'd do that ? I don 't have another choice . There are always choices , Aeryn . The only other choice is death for everyone , Talyn included . Well , I 'm not gonna let you go with him . There isn 't another solution . There has to be . We 're out of time . Aeryn . Your nephew wants to see you . I knew he would . Eventually . Officer Sun ... make your choice . I want to go with you . Crichton . This is a beneficial turn of events for all concerned ... with the happy exception of Scorpius . Crais , I don 't like this plan and I never will . So you better behave yourself with Talyn ... and Aeryn . 'Cause if you hurt either one of them ... I 'm going to hunt you down . You hunt me down . That would complete the symmetry nicely , wouldn 't it ? Last time we stood here , we didn 't say good - bye . And it wasn 't good - bye , as it turned out . Here 's hoping history repeats itself . Talyn , we have returned . We are prepared to guide you out of danger , take you far from the domain of the Peacekeepers Maneuver very close to Moya . Her starburst will carry us all to safety . What is that ? It is the Hand of Friendship . It is the greatest honor it can bestow . Talyn , who 's it for ? Thank you . I humbly accept . No , Talyn . Talyn . Talyn , what 's happening ? Talyn , what have you done ? What is that ? A neural transponder . A direct interface with Talyn . His senses . His propulsors . His weaponry . I command them all . You command him ? Every system . It 's indescribable . It 's a pity you can 't experience it . Crais , we were going to share command ... Talyn chose otherwise . - He needs both of us . - No . We no longer need you . Talyn can only have one master . You may return to Moya . I will not . You must . He and I are of like mind on this . Crais , take that thing off . Take it off . Take it off or I will ! Talyn , I 'm not the enemy ! We know that . But you cannot stay aboard here . You have 50 microts to get back to your Prowler before we open that passageway into space . Good health , Officer Sun . Pilot , why hasn 't Talyn tucked in close ? We need a starburst damn soon . In 90 microts , the carrier will be in range to fire . Then what 's keeping them ? The Prowler has just emerged from Talyn . Who 's aboard ? Officer Sun . She 's asking to return to Moya . Pilot , get her aboard fast . 40 more microts . Charging all frag cannons . Boarding parties standing by . Fire when at optimal range . Scorpius , my final progress report . Stay that command . The gunship is secured , and I am resigning my Peacekeeper commission effective immediately . Crais , cease this nonesense . And as for Crichton , he is dead . I killed him with my bare hands . My brother is avenged . Here ends my report , Captain . Fire upon both leviathans . Starburst ? I thought Talyn wasn 't ready . He obviously learns a lot faster than we thought . Pilot , is the Prowler aboard ? Yes . Prepare for immediate starburst . Lieutenant . Your tactical expert claimed the gunship 's ability to starburst would not mature for an arm . Send him to me so I might educate him . Yes , sir . Start searching for Moya on her most probable starburst vectors . Not the gunship , sir ? After all , with Crichton dead ... Crichton isn 't dead . That 's merely Crais ' small attempt to take revenge upon me . How can you be so sure ? If Crais had killed Crichton , he wouldn 't tell me . Crichton is alive . And I will find him . If you are going to sit there in a coma , you could at least smile . Sweet D 'Argo . I was just thinking . Part of the Seek ? No , Aeryn was right . And as much as I want to immerse myself in the Seek and in the next level of existence , I cannot abandon you all . I will slow down the Seek . The next level will always be there . This one will not . Then we must cherish it while we have it . We must cherish each other . I failed . No , you did everything you could . In other words , I failed . Officer Sun . Talyn told Moya he was choosing Crais of his own volition . Yeah , for what that 's worth . He 'll contact her from time to time and let her know he 's okay . Oh , they say they 'll call home , Pilot , once a week . Never do . Talyn will be all right , won 't he ? Well , he 's young . And he 's going to make mistakes . But he 'll learn . And if Crais ever mistreats him , he 'll bounce him . Maybe Crais won 't mistreat him . He could 've killed me , you know . He could have killed all of us and he didn 't . Yeah . Maybe he just needed to save the energy for starburst . Or maybe he 's changed . Well , you do believe people can change , don 't you John ? Well ? Well ... you have . I have . But Crais ?

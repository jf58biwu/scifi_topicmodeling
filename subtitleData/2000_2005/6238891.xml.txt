 Exciting news , people ! The pet license I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived . Hermes , that 's sweet . I didn 't know you cared about Nibbler . Dream on , woman . I 'd like to put the little bastard in a sack ... and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space ... but I do like filling out requisitions ... and these were some doozies . Great Jah 's dreadlocks ! There 's been a mix-up . This isn 't a pet license , it 's a fishing license ! And it 's mandatory ! Ah ! The exact center of the Atlantic Ocean . This seems the logical place for fish to congregate . So , we 're in international waters ? Indeed so . Falcon , this is Blue Raven . The goose has nested . Repeat , the goose has nested . Hey , guess what you 're accessories to . The sun , the sea air , good friends ... Leela 's right . Fishing blows . What do you say we make it interesting ? Everybody kick in five bucks . There , wasn 't that interesting ? Bender ! This contest is as good as over . I once caught a fish this big . Oh , yeah ? I once caught a fish this big . I 'm afraid you 're both out of your league , boys ... 'cause you 're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon . Harpoon , my ass . Okay . Let 's see now . Which bait to use ... crickets , squid ... - chicken necks ? - Excuse me . If I might be so bold ... I 'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic . These sardines , for example ... are bland and tasteless . And these dry , stringy night crawlers ... Though juicy , very , very juicy ... I don 't believe this ! It 's eating my bait ! Beat it , you mooching crawdad ! Woo , woo , woo , woo , woo ! Hey , Fry , check out my laser-guided fishing rod . Quiet , Bender , you 're scaring away the fish . Fine . I 'll head over to the other side . Good luck fishing on this side ! I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards . Oh , yeah ? I can hit a shrimp . A shrimp ? I find it a bit hard to believe that . Ah , ha ! Gather ' round , chumps . I got the winner ! Oh . Oh , so this is where you shop for your boots . Couple more of those ... and you 'll have yourself a fish stick . Hey ! A fish this fine belongs in a fish-nugget-style chunklet . Anyway , it 's bigger than anything you 've caught . Ow ! My small intestine ! Bingo ! Whatever it is , it 's 20 times heavier than a boot . - Oh ! - You 'll never catch anything ... with that primitive technology . What you need is this fish pheromone ... the most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind . Uh , oh . I 'm so into you . Oh , my ! Hey , Bender ! I just caught a fish this big . Quit exaggerating , Fry . Aw , screw this . If I 'm not going to catch a fish ... I might as well not catch a big fish . There . Like most of life 's problems ... this one can be solved with bending . Bender , be careful ! That 's the ship 's diamond filament tether . It 's unbreakable . Then why do I have to be careful ? It belonged to my grandmother . My Manwich ! Wake up , everyone ! I 've got something , and this time it 's alive . Oh ! Dr. Zoidberg , since when do you even wear boots ? I wasn 't wearing it . I was eating it . Come on , let 's go home . Sunburn ! My fabulous body ! It 's ruined ! What happened to my parasol ? I don 't know . It wasn 't here when I took your umbrella . What ? ! I put sunblock on you . Well , it didn 't work . Come on , Bender . Pull in your line , and let 's go . Hey , I 'm snagged . It 's not snagged . The mechano-man has caught something . Sweet zombie Jesus ! It 's huge ! It 's coming up ! - Whoa , that 's big ! - A Colossal Mouth Bass ! It 's diving ! It 's pulling us under ! Everyone , into the ship ! Wait , I 'll save us ... by cutting the unbreakable diamond filament . Well , at least I 'll die with my friends . Hello ? My Speedos ! Depth at 45 hundred feet ... 48 hundred , 50 hundred . 5,000 feet . Dear Lord ! That 's over 150 atmospheres of pressure ! How many atmospheres can the ship withstand ? Well , it 's a spaceship ... so I 'd say anywhere between zero and one . What 's that ? Is someone bending girders ? Oy ! We 'll be crushed if we don 't equalize the pressure . How do we do that ? That should do it . Oh ! We 're all going to die ! Wait , I 'll be back in a minute . - You did it , Fry ! - Did what ? People , it 's far , far worse ... than we thought . My fish got away . There ! Good as new . Except that we 're three miles below the surface ... we don 't have any food ... and the ship won 't work underwater . Tempers are wearing thin . Let 's just hope some robot doesn 't kill everybody . The important thing is that we don 't panic . There are rules for situations like this . Now , the first order of business is lunch . I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg . I mean , uh , lobster Newburg . I mean , Dr. Zoidberg . Okay , everyone . Calm down . The professor and I will get to work on the ship . Bender , Zoidberg , since you can survive underwater ... you 'll go out and look for food . I better go , too . They don 't know what I like . Fry , no ! The pressure will crush you ... like a green snake under a sugarcane truck ! Not necessarily . This is a chance for Fry to test out ... my experimental anti-pressure pill . I can 't swallow that . Well , then , good news ! It 's a suppository . How are you doing there , Fry ? Glad to hear it . Aha ! Aw , yeah ! Yum , yum , yum . Uh-oh . Look at me . I 'm Dr. Zoidberg ... homeowner . Careful , Fry . I think that flag might be poisonous . Ahoy , mateys ! I shanghaied us some hearty grub . The laws of science be a harsh mistress . Say , robot , old buddy , could you help me move a couch ? Aw , okay , but I 'm not carrying it upstairs . What is it , Fry ? ... ade . You want some lemonade ? You saw a big parade ? Your students loans have been repaid ? Then how about lending your old pal Zoidberg ... a few bucks , Mr. Millionaire ? Fry , swallow your food , then talk . A mermaid ! You think you saw a mermaid ? No . I did see a mermaid . She was wearing a tube top . And she had a beautiful , scaly tail ... and I think she had hair extensions . You 're simply hallucinating , you moron . What 's so far-fetched about mermaids ? There 's all sorts of weird sea creatures ... here in the future , like Dr. Zoidberg . I 'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness . Every time something good happens to me ... you say it 's some kind of madness or I 'm drunk ... or I ate too much candy . Well , I saw a real mermaid ... and I wish just once my friends would have ... the decency and kindness to believe me . Ocean madness . He may have ocean madness ... but that 's no excuse for ocean rudeness . " Ocean madness . " Yeah , right . Yeah , it 's always something , ain 't it ? It 's her ! Bender , wake up ! She 's here ! Wake up ! Oxygen . Here you go , darling . Hey , I can breathe and talk . Just like a fish . Oh , you speak Fish ? What ? I 'm sorry , my accent 's atrocious . - Hi . My name 's Umbriel . - I 'm Fry . So , uh , am I going to drown ? 'Course not . Just stay calm ... and let the gentle currents relax your every muscle . Oh , yeah ! Did it just get warmer ? I can 't believe you 're really real . I like your tail . Oh , you 're sweet . I like those wiggly doodads coming out of your hips . Oh , thanks . They 're called pants . This here 's a volcanic vent . The water comes out at over 4,000 degrees . No kidding ? Ah . Did it just get colder ? Tell me more about that bizarre landy world you come from . Is there water there , too ? Sure . Sometimes it falls from the sky . - Hmm . - And sometimes it doesn 't . Oh , Mr. Fry , you do go on . You know what I like best about you , Umbriel ? You find me fascinating ... even when I 'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer . Lions ? There are sea lions on the land ? Yup . We call them " land sea lions . " I tame them . I 'm almost done reconfiguring ... the ship 's propulsion system . We can leave as soon as the papier-mâché is dry . - Where 's Fry ? - I didn 't kill him . Professor ? No , I 've been busy . He must have gone out looking for that " mermaid . " The poor , demented honky . It 's ocean madness , all right . Sailors call it " aqua dementia , " " the deep down crazies ... " " the wet willies , " " the screaming moist ... " We 'll form a search party . Now , we 'll need oxygen . I got it covered . In the event of an emergency ... my ass can be used as a flotation device . Oh , that reminds me . You 've all taken your pressure pills , right ? Yes . Stop asking . I 've got his scent . Over here where the water gets warmer . This way . Ooh ! Bend me ! Dude ! An ancient sunken city ! Could it possibly be ? Are the old legends true ? It is ! It 's the fabled lost city of Atlanta ! Howdy , y 'all ! Welcome to Atlanta . Folks ' round these parts call me the Colonel . Here , have some breathers ... courtesy of our chamber of commerce . This is uncomfortable and humiliating . Now , if they could put it in the form of a suppository ... Y 'all enjoy your stay . Tourism 's our main source of income ' round here ... so , uh , see the sights , spend some money . Please don 't leave . Fry ! Oh , I just knew you were still alive ! I owe you ten bucks , Hermes . Hey , the most amazing thing happened . It 's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme ... plus , there 's mermaids . Nice out-of-town folks ... I 'd like you to meet my daughter , Umbriel . Umbriel , these are some Yankees . So , Fry ... Atlanta was an American city in your time ? I think it was just an airport . They had a place where you could buy nuts . No ! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub . It was a vibrant metropolis ... the equal of Paris or New York . That 's right , honey . Whatever you say . Look at these fabulous ruins ... Turner Field , the Coca-Cola bottling plant ... the , uh , the airport . But , tell us , how could a city ... with such a fabulous airport ... end up underwater ? Ah , now , that 's a story ... that can only rightly be told in a chamber of commerce video ... narrated by folk-rock troubadour , Donovan . Atlanta was a city , landlocked ... hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean . Yet , so desperate the city 's desire for tourism ... that they moved offshore , becoming an island ... and an even bigger Delta hub , until the city overdeveloped ... and it started to sink . Knowing their fate , the quality people ... ran away ... Ted Turner , Hank Aaron , Jeff Foxworthy ... the guy who invented Coca-Cola , the Magician ... and the other so-called gods of our legends ... though gods they were ... and also , Jane Fonda was there . The others chose to remain behind on their porches ... with their rifles , and one day evolve into mermaids ... and sing , and dance , and ring in the new . Hail Atlanta ! " The Magician " ? Whoa-whoa-whoa ! Wouldn 't it take millions of years ... to evolve into mermaids ? Normally , yes . But the caffeine really sped things up . That stuff 's wonderful . So , when Umbriel ... first brought home this carpetbagger ... I was agin ' it ... but damn if ol ' legs here ain 't grown on me ! Aw , shucks , Colonel . Well , it 's all very nice here ... but we should be going . I miss me wife and me oxygen . Yes , we all miss our loved ones and gases . - Come on , Fry . - Wait . I 'm not going with you . But , Fry , what about us ? What about your life on the surface ? You don 't belong down here . She 's right . I mean , sure , they got the Braves ... but it 's a third-rate symphony . Fry , you half-mad , half-insane maniac ... be reasonable . Don 't you realize that if you stay at this depth ... your body will permanently adapt to the pressure ? Realize it ? I don 't even understand it . It means you 'll never be able to return to the surface . I don 't care . I 'm staying . I 've got everything I want right here . I 'm bored ! Let 's go . You know , Fry ... I 've got a little place just outside town . You could come visit , maybe ? Sorry , Zoidberg . I 'm trying to join the country club . Ah , Fry ! I 'll miss you ! Y 'all come back , now , you hear ? Let 's go , damn it ! Let 's go ! Well , I guess this is good-bye for me as well . - Whatever . - Later . Bye . Whoa ! My home ! It burned down ! How did this happen ? That 's a very good question . So , that 's where I left my cigar . That just raises further questions . You know , Umbriel , these last 24 hours ... have been the happiest days of my life . Oh , Fry , I want you to make a mer-woman out of mer-me . Mercy ! I do believe I 'm gettin ' the vapors . What the hell is that ? Yeah , I 'm a little confused , too . How do I , you know , with the tail , and all ? I 'm not your first , am I ? I mean , I lay my eggs , then I leave ... and you release your fertilizer . Why couldn 't she be the other kind of mermaid ... with the fish part on top , and the lady part on the bottom ? Now , who 's going to escort me to the debutante ball ? Well , what about that rich , young dugong from Macon ? There . The engine modifications are complete . Prepare for launch . Wait ! Wait for me ! Don 't leave me here ! Ah ! And , so ... in honor of his record-breaking catch ... I 'm proud to award Bender this check for $ 1,000 . - It 's you ! - Hey , buddy ! My Manwich ! Fry , are you all right ? What happened ? What about Umbriel ? Well , it turns out I loved her , but I wasn 't " in love " with her . Trouble in bed . Ah , it 's great to have you back , buddy . Wait , uh ... This is no record . Give me back that check . I 'm giving it to some giant orphans . Ow ! Bender , you 're hurting me ! Ow ! Hey ! I 'm trying to sleep in here .

 # ANOTHER DAY # I grew up on the banks of this river . Beautiful , and tranquil . This place is full of memories . Some good , and some that have broken my heart . I used to watch the sun glisten off of the rivers glassy surface , and the water looked like a calm and soothing dream . But just below the surface , the river was dark , scary , and had the power to take life , as easily as it could give it . My life also had two very different sides . Things weren 't always as serene and peaceful as they appeared on the surface . And this river was more powerful than I could ever understand . It gave me the chance to experience a part of my life that had been taken away from me . I have two stories to tell , and two important men in my world . Paul , the love of my life , and David , my best friend . A friend who is always there for me . These are my stories . Hey ! - Hey . It came ! - What came ? Ok . You better give it to me . Now . Or we 're never having sex again . Come on . I 'm in . Oh ! I cannot believe I got into Med school ! - Oh , I believe it . I can quite my job ! Eventually right ? How 's it feel ? - It feels good . Sometimes there is nothing worse than having your dreams come true . Well , Kate , there 's nothing wrong with you . You 're in perfect health , and you 're pregnant . Katie ? You wanna come in for a second ? Okay , so uh , just . Hear me out on this , alright ? I was thinking you see this area over here ? Right ? Yeah . Perfect place for a crib . And , uh , you know over here , we could put like a change table , a chest of drawers , a toy chest You know , whatever we need . And this could be the perfect place . Lots of light , plenty of room to play . And you know , we got this teddy bear ! Now come here . Look , I know this isn 't what we planned . And uh , I know the timing couldn 't be worse . But hey , we can do this . I know we can . Marry me . Paul , you have no idea how many times I 've dreamed about this , you know . You , me , a family of our own . But not like this . Not now . I mean . Eight years I have been saving , you know and , going to night school , and working in a job that I can 't stand . And now , when I finally have a chance . So quit . It 's not like I make minimum wage . What about school ? - Push it back a couple years . Big deal . Push it back . Right . What ? You think you 're the only woman that ever went to school that had a baby ? Ok . We are talking about med school Paul . How am I gonna watch after a kid ? I mean who 's going to look after him ? What , you ? - Why not ? - On your schedule ? This wasn 't the plan , Paul . Do you realize who you 're talking about ? Yes . - So , I don 't have any say in this ? Is that it ? I don 't believe this . I don 't believe this is happening . Oh . This is gonna solve things . Where are you going ? Where are you going ? ! I asked you a question . Where are you going ? Get out of my way . Just get out of my way . You wanna act like a child , go ahead . I didn 't know where I was going . I just needed to get away from Paul . I wasn 't ready to be a mother . Not yet . I just needed to get away . I was on the road for a couple of days , but I realized that Paul was right . I was acting like a child . I needed to return home , to work things out with him . Gabby ! Gabby ! What happened ? Ray ! Ray ! Where 's my husband ? Gabby , he 's hurt , I don 't know how badly , he 's right over here . Oh my god , Ray ! Ray ! Oh my god , Ray ! Ray ! Bob ! Bob ! There 's someone still inside ! Yeah , there is . What I want to know is what the hell is he doing in there ? What ? - It 's Paul , Kate . The only one inside is Paul . And there is no way to get him out . How you doing , Katie ? I 've had better days . Day like today It would 've been kind of nice to have my mom here . Um , look , you go , okay ? I 'll be ... I 'll be fine . I don 't mind staying - Um , really . I 'll be alright . You sure ? You need me , I 'm right next door . Yeah . It 's David . Um hum . Yeah , she 's , she 's ok . Listen , her boyfriend just died today . Can 't it wait ? Look , I 'll call you in the morning . All right . I 'll let you know when she 's ready . Who was that ? - Sheriff 's department . What do they want ? It 's Ray . He 's saying that , Paul set the fire . On purpose . That 's , that 's ridiculous . I agree . But that 's what he 's saying . But is there something you need to tell me ? I don 't know who started that fire , but I know it wasn 't Paul . Hey . How you doin ' ? She 's beautiful , Katie . Yeah , I know . Her name is Meghan . Takes after Paul a little bit , don 't you think ? What do you think , sweet girl ? It 's just you and me . I know . Do you think we can do it ? I think we can make it , ok . So what do you want to tell me about your boyfriend ? I don 't have a boyfriend . Yeah ? You don 't have one ? - No . Are you sure ? - I 'm sure , I 'm sure . Would you tell me if you did have one ? Nope . - No . See , so maybe you do have one . I do not have one . I like boys , but , I don 't have a boyfriend . Hey ! - Hey mom ! - Hey beautiful . Hey , what are you doin ' ? Hi ! - Hi . What is that on your arm ? A tattoo . - A tattoo of what ? A motorcycle . A Chief , to be specific . It 's a classic . David , I appreciate you babysitting . But , is it me , or is that a little weird ? For a four year-old ? - Well , what you call " weird " others might call " interesting . " Un huh , well , take a look at this . - What is it ? I got in to the accounting program . And this is a good thing ? What do you mean ? You 're okay with this ? Why wouldn 't I be ? It 's not exactly a career in medicine . Right , like that 's gonna happen . Okay , so maybe med school 's out . But I mean nursing or something ? Do you have some kind of a problem with accountants that we don 't know about ? Well it just doesn 't seem like you , does it ? It 's not really about me , is it ? Will you do me a favor ? - Um hum . Go up to the house and wash your hands . Thank you . Get ! What are you so on my case for ? I 'm not . - Yeah , you are David . I mean , don 't you think that I 'm trying ? Don 't you think I 'm doing the best that I can ? - That 's not what I 'm saying . Then what are you saying ? - Look , just relax , alright ? It 's just some dreams die hard , you know ? What about your dream ? I mean , what have you done that is so amazing ? And you 're supposed to be this great artist , and look at you , you paint houses for a living . What happened to your great career ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't . - No , it 's okay . Don 't apologize . Fact is , you 're right . You 're absolutely right . That 's all talk ! All right . Mr. Pippy is done Pipping . You can have him now . - You take Mr. No , you keep him . And I 'll take Mr. Puffalump . - Kiss me . Go to bed . Wow It 's for her birthday . You are gonna make one little girl very , very happy . Got a buddy of mine in Chicago who 's been asking me to move there . I think I 'm gonna go . Do you think that , you know , we might be over-reacting just a little , bit ? Let 's not play games , okay ? We both known this day 's been coming . I want you to come with me . What did you think I was gonna do Kate ? Just sit around , waiting forever ? Don 't be mad . - Is that what you think this is ? You think I 'm mad at you ? No . David was moving on with his life , without me , and I couldn 't stop thinking about Paul . Hey Gabby . Paul 's headstone was vandalized again . You wouldn 't happen to know anything about that would you ? No . - Really ? You know something Kate . A lot of people lost their jobs that day . And my husband 's health was destroyed . People ask , and I tell them Paul started the fire . You don 't like it , find another place to live . Go to hell . Gabby , can we please just go now ? I 'd just like to go home now . Ok ? Hey , be careful ! Shouldn 't listen to people like that , Katie . Don 't let her get to you . Right , so then what am I supposed to do ? I mean , what do I end up telling Meghan ? Maybe she 's right . The time has come to move on . So , maybe you should . Why don 't you come with me ? I meant what I said . I 'm done here . I 'm gone . I 'm serious . Maybe this is just what we need . You know , get out of town , start some place new . Maybe , maybe give you and me a chance see what happens . I want you to come with me , Katie . I 'm sorry . I ... - Don 't say anything . I mean , what 's to say , anyway ? Know what kills me , though ? I never forgot what you said to me that day we went up to Portage Grove . Where ? Portage Grove , remember ? We were looking for Paul . The day he died . No , I was on the road . Driving . All day . What are you talking about ? You were with me . No , I wasn 't . So I guess it must have been somebody else that gave me this . How did you get that ? - You gave it to me , remember ? When I asked you what it was ... - No ! That 's impossible all right because it 's one of a kind and I made it with Meghan in craft class last week . Mommy ! Meghan ! Mommy ! Meghan ! Mommy help ! Mommy help ! Mommy help ! Kate ? - Meghan ? - Kate . Just lay still . Hey man get over here man ! Are you OK ? Just lie back , OK , take deep breaths . Just lay still Kate . How did this happen ? Just relax . - Get an ambulance ! Get an ambulance ! Kate , Kate , you alright ? MOMMY ! Meghan ! David ? What ? - Where is she ? Who ? - Meghan ? What do you mean ? - Is she okay ? I don 't understand Katie , just , hey . Just calm down . Don 't you remember Katie ? She she died . Your mother died years ago Katie . I 'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MY MOTHER ! - Then who are you talking about ? I 'm talking about my baby , Meghan ! This isn 't happening . What 's wrong ? Hey come on . Kate ! - Just give her a minute Paul . Just a minute . - What day is it ? It 's Friday . - I mean what 's the date ? Twelfth . - Of ? May . What year ? What year ? The Doctor said she and the baby are going to be all right . The hypothermia put her into shock and then post shock syndrome . That says a lot . She tell you what the hell happened ? She wouldn 't look at me . I 'm not lookin ' that bad am I ? No worse than usual . Thank you . So , uh , let me ask you something . Shoot . You 've known her since pre-school . Has she ever acted like this ? All the time . You get used to it . - You think so ? - Well you 'd better . You live with her right . All right , I 'm gonna get back . Good luck . Mommy ! Mommy ! STOP ! Where are you going ? - I 'm looking for someone . Who ? - You . I 'm over here . Are you alright ? You know , there is one more place I want to check out . What do you see ? - What do you mean ? I mean , what do you see . Well , I see the river . And the town , obviously . What do you see in the town ? I see the docks , the factory . Yeah . The factory . I have no idea what 's going on . Come on Kate , there 's somewhere I want to show you . It 's a cool place , hun ? I love it . I 'm a lucky man , Kate , you know . Money may not be the greatest , but I 've got the best job going as far as I 'm concerned . And you know what ? I 'd do it for free . And I want you to feel the same way , about what you do . I know how hard you worked for that scholarship . I know what it means to you . And I was wrong to ask you to put it off . But I don 't want you to . I want to have this baby . And I 'm willing to make some changes . But I 'll support you and whatever you decide to do . OK ? I 'm sorry , about the fight . I 'm sorry too . What 's wrong ? Hey , what 's wrong ? Mommy ! Mommy ! Kate ? Are those for me ? So , is your offer still good ? That day in the sun room , you asked me to marry you . Well , the answer is " yes . " I want to marry you Paul , today . I called Reverend James and he agreed to perform the service . He can be here in ten minutes . - No . No . What I meant was , I don 't understand . Why today ? What 's the rush ? Everything changes , OK . Everything is going to be different from here on out . What are you talking about ? Just trust me , okay ? Honey , I do trust you . I trust you with my life . But , but I don 't want to do it like this . You know , not until you tell me what 's going on . You 're going to die . If we stay in this town , you are going to die . Tomorrow . At the factory . There 's going to be a fire . What are you talking about ? I was there . I saw it with my own eyes . It hasn 't happened yet , but you were there ? It was five years ago . Five years ago tomorrow , you died in a fire at the factory . But we 're going to change that , you 're not gonna be there . Is this , a joke ? What do you think Paul ? I mean do you think that I just woke up this morning and thought , " Hey , I know , I 'll just pretend that I 'm from the future . " Yeah . That sounds like fun . Look , I know that this sounds crazy . - What do you expect from me ? What do you want me to say ? I believe you ? No . Just stay with me . Is that too much to ask ? Hey guys , how 's it goin ' ? How you feeling ? - Um better , thanks . Hey , you guys hungry ? We 've got food . I could eat . - Come on ! Burgers , hot dogs . Can I get you anything ? Something to drink ? Um no , but I do have the one question . What , what is it ? What , you mean I have to spoon-feed you ? Doesn 't that negate the whole purpose of art ? You have absolutely no idea what it is , do you ? Let 's just call it a work in progress . - Oh , OK . You okay ? - Uh , yeah , I 'm fine . I mean , I 'm only asking ' cause , hey , it 's not everyday they find you lying out in the middle of the road , half dead , you know ? You wanna tell me what 's going on ? Sure . Why not ? What if I told you , that uh , I 've seen the future - that I 've lived there ? Well , first I 'd probably say something like , " Whoa , that 's some serious weed you 're smokin ' there , girl . " And then , knowing me , I 'd probably say something like " Can I have some please ? " So , what 's going on with you two ? Well , what can I say , Katie A man 's " got needs " . - Oh ? Well you might want to be careful . I have a feeling this girl 's in love . What ? I don 't suppose I could get you to tell her I 'm moving then , could I ? What are you talking about ? A couple friends of mine from school found this great loft in Chicago . Guess the rent 's pretty cheap , huge space , great light . Might as well try and find out if my stuff is really any good or not . Right ? What about your dream ? I mean , what have you done that is so amazing ? And you 're supposed to be this great artist , and look at you , you paint houses for a living . What happened to your great career ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't . - No , it 's okay . Don 't apologize . Fact is , you 're right . You 're absolutely right . How come you never told me about this . I only decided a couple days ago . You never told me , why it was so important to you . Why what was so important ? The baby . Starting a family . It 's not . - Paul . Kate , it 's not , really . Please . Well it 's not something that I thought about a lot , you know . But when I found out you were pregnant , it just felt right . You know , it 's like ... What ? It was like , it just uh , everything fell into place . Like I knew this person , somehow , you know . Does that make sense ? It 's like I got this empty space inside of me that 's waiting for him , and I didn 't know it . You know ? And what makes you so sure that it 's a boy ? It 's just a feeling , that I get . And what happens if it 's a girl ? Let 's go to sleep . - Just tell me . Do you think that I 'd have a problem with that ? You think that I wouldn 't love her as much as I love you ? His name is Meghan . And the day she was born , I cried for you . I cried for you . For me . For the baby that you would never know and there I was , you know . Holding , this beautiful , precious child And all I could think is that there 's nothing that you wouldn 't do there is no price that you would 'd pay , just to hold her ... You have no idea how many times I 've wanted to tell you about her you know just to turn to you and say , Wow ! Look ! That 's our daughter ! We did this . You and me ! And she 's so tiny , and innocent . And I 've never felt so much love before . She thinks about you , you know . Or at least , she 's starting to . She asks about you . I think that she 's just beginning to sense that she 's lost something . Something that can 't be replaced . It 's something that she 'll never know . And she 's out there , and she 's lost and she 's afraid , and she needs me . And I have no idea how to find her . Come on . That night , after our fight . - Kate , you don 't have to . Just ... After our fight , I got in the car and I just started driving , you know . I didn 't care where I was going , as long as it was far away from here . I stopped and I turned around and I came straight back . But it was too late . By the time I got here , the factory was on fire and you were trapped inside . And they said that you were dead . And then there 's Ray . He said that you started the fire . I started it . Yeah . He almost died that night . It 's a miracle he 's even alive , his lungs were burned so bad . A lot of peoples lives were destroyed that night . Your 's , Ray 's , Mine . Paul , I 'm not gonna ask you to believe me . But what I am gonna ask you to do is tomorrow . No matter what happens ? Just stay away from the factory . Please ? Fine . Sure . Paul ? Uh , hey , have you seen Paul ? Well I heard him pull out . Must have been what a couple of hour ago ? Whenever it was , it was early . Everything okay ? Hey , Ian . - Hey , gorgeous . What 's up ? Have you seen Paul ? - No I 'm sorry , I haven 't . Alright , well he went out his boat , today so if you see him , will you tell him that I 'm looking for him ? - You bet ! - Alright . Hey Kate . Is there a problem ? - No . Hey , Burton . Have you seen Paul ? Your Paul ? Nope . No luck ? You haven 't heard from him either ? Kate , what 's goin ' on ? Um , it 's been kind of a crazy time , David . Yeah . I pretty much figured that out all by myself . He just left . No note , nothing . Any other day , I wouldn 't have any problem with this . But not today . He 's not answering . - I 'm sure there 's nothing to worry about . So he needed some time to himself ? So what ? With all you guys have been going through you can 't blame him , can you ? Yeah , you know there is one more place I 'd like check out alright ? Um , I don 't remember what it 's called , but he took me there yesterday . It 's a grove that sits on the river . With these trees growing out of the water . Yeah , I think I know it . Portage Grove . It 's like , a couple hours from here ? What did you say it was called ? Portage Grove , remember ? We were looking for Paul . How do I get there ? I know about the baby , Kate . Paul told me you don 't know what you 're gonna do about keeping it . No , I 'm keeping her , alright . Her ? Meghan . Her name is Meghan . What is this , some kind of woman 's intuition ? Something like that . Meghan , huh ? After your mom . I 'll look forward to meeting her . Well , that 's good , 'cause the two of you are gonna be the best of friends . Oh yeah ? Yeah . Well , it was worth a shot , right ? Do you believe in destiny ? Can 't say I 've really given it much thought . But if you mean , do I think the future 's carved out in stone or something , the answer 's no . What about the past ? Was that some kind of trick question ? OK , dying ? You know , I mean , do you ever stop and think about all the things that you would miss , if you died like , tomorrow ? Or today ? That 's funny you should say that . I was just asking myself that same thing . Ah , forget it . - Oh , come on . That 's kind of a strange question , don 't you think ? Forget that I asked . Well sure , there 's plenty of things I 'd miss . Like I 'd never see the Cubbies win the World Series , for one thing . Mind you , I probably won 't see that if I live to be a hundred . Alright , you know what , just stop . - ' Course , it wouldn 't be all bad . There 's some good things to be said for dying young , you know . - Like what ? Like I don 't know you don 't have to put up with the telemarketing people calling you the moment you sit down for dinner . That 's a definite plus . - You know this is just one big joke to you , isn 't it ? And you want to know why ? Because you don 't have a clue . Alright ! You have never lost anyone . And until you do . - Okay So I think now would be a good time for you to tell me what the hell is going on . Once - just once I would like to be able to ask you a real question and get a real answer . Just take me back . Did it ever occur to you that maybe , just maybe , you posed the question wrong ? You want a real answer from me , Kate ? Fine . Here it is . Fact is , I couldn 't give a damn about what I 'd miss if I died . Okay ? It 's what I 'll miss if I live , that I worry about . Kate ? Um , I think that you 're supposed to have this . That I 'm supposed to give it to you . What are you talking about ? I don 't know . You never told me . You were talking about me . The things that you 'll miss if you live . You were talking about me . Why are you doing this ? Why didn 't you tell me ? When we were kids I always just figured that some day , it 'd be you and me , you know ? Always thought that I don 't know one day , you 'd see me , and it would just be right . Instead , along comes Paul , who blows into your world , sweeps you off your feet . And what can I say ? The rest is history , right ? You want to know the strangest thing about all this ? It 's that I like the guy . I really do . Fact is , I 'm I 'm really happy for you . Okay , thanks . If you see her , just tell her that I 'm looking for her , alright ? So , I 'll see you later . Don 't bother picking me up after work OK . I won 't be here . I 'm going to go stay at my sister 's . What ? Why ? - C 'mon Ray , don 't act so surprised . I don 't understand Gabby ! Uh , you know what ? I think I 'm gonna get out here . You don 't want me to drop you home ? - No , I 'm fine . You sure ? Don 't sweat it , Katie . My bet , he 's already home . Look , David ... - Just worry about lookin ' after yourself , alright ? Right . You know , if you 've ever wondered if it 's possible to be in love with two people at the same time ? The answer is " yes . " Where have you been , man ? - Where 's Kate ? I dropped her off downtown . You dropped her off without a car ? It 's what she wanted me to do . At the factory ? A few blocks away . Why ? Jeez , Ray . What ? - Yeah , right . Hello ? What the hell are you doing here ? Kate , you can 't go in there ! Kate , I 'll take care of it Kate , Kate ! Get out of here , come on . We have to call 911 ! - Get out of here ! Don 't do that Kate . This is my job . Just get the hell out of here . I 'll take care of the fire , just go ! Kate ! Hey , hey hey . Look at me , are you OK ? Come on , let 's go , let 's get out of here . Come on . Paul . Oh god ... Oh , Oh . Oh . Kate , the sprinklers . We gotta get the sprinklers . Alright , Paul ! We have to get out of here ! OK ? I know , I know . We have to go . Paul ! - Just go . No ! I 'm not leaving here without you . Come on ! Katie , go . I 'm not leaving here without you Paul , please ... please . Have I told you how much I love you ? I warned you I tried to stop this We have a little girl We have a baby girl out there . Go find her . Go . Find her . Please , please , no , please , please , no , no , oh god no ... Kate ? ! Kate ? What happened to you ? Where is she ? There are a lot of people looking for you . Where 's Meghan ? - She 's at home , with David . They 're safe . I know what happened . - What took you so long ? I want my daughter to know the truth . I thought you were dead . I thought you both were dead I , you know ... Why didn 't you say anything ? I 'd like to tell your daughter what really happened Kate . I 'd like that very much . Ok . Now . Like the river that carried my life in two different directions , I ultimately arrived at my destiny . A wonderful life with David and Meghan . I will always love Paul , and one day , I will be able to teach our daughter what I have learned . You can never change the past , but you can change the future .

 Previously on Farscape . Chiana : What 's he doing here ? What does he want ? He wants asylum . A relationship is based on trust . I didn 't wanna tell you about the pregnancy until I was sure . Noranti : Distillate of Laka . One whiff and the pain is gone . It 's to help him move on . Surmount his feelings and forget . And now on Farscape . Scorpius : Pilot , why is that trading vessel still aboard ? The negotiation is proving difficult . These traders are asking exorbitant prices for their maps , yet we dare not traverse Tormented Space , without reliable star charts . For 5,000 crindars I want maps that are current and authentic . I said ten . And she said five . Buy your maps elsewhere . Are you so sure another buyer will come along ? What ? Nothing 's bothering me . Something I said ? Must have been something I said . Trader : 9,000 . No more talk . Except to say goodbye . Wait ! - No . Seven . Final offer . The Dominar will pay you . Scorpius : You look unusually smug . Your deal . It was successful ? You have no idea . ( giggles ) One more trade . No tricks . We enjoyed her . Plenty of good pleasure left . No value to an old woman , but ... but to men ... ( lecherous chuckle ) Touch her again , you fekik , and you die ! Calm down . D 'Argo : Chiana , this is not our problem . Well have you forgotten what it 's like to be a prisoner ? 800 crindars . Bargain . She 's yours . Chiana : We can 't just leave her . Okay . I 'll buy her myself if I have to . You brought that Vorc onto Moya , remember ? What 's your name ? Talika . Talika . Okay , here 's the deal . We take her , or I take her head off . Rygel : Shoot her . She 's nothing to me . Rygel ... pay them . But , uh ... - Pay them ! Chrichton : Sparky , cough it up . Trader : A smart purchase . You 'll have fun with her . ( shrieks ) D 'Argo : This is a bad idea . Nine times out of ten . First nice planet we find , we 'll drop her off . This isn 't ... no , no , I 'm a friend . A friend . Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . Chiana , grab her ! - Whoa . Chrichton : Take it easy . We 're not gonna hurt you . Oh ! Okay , hold her ! Grab her ! Okay , take her to your room . She is your responsibility . Hey . Talika , come on . I 'll get you some food , some better clothes . ( low growl ) Pilot : The trading vessel is now leaving Moya . D 'Argo : Good . So you 're angry with me ? Let 's talk . I don 't want to talk . Aeryn . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Aeryn : There 's nothing to say . The hell there 's not ! You hit me ! You lied to me . - Hey , you lied to me . You said nothing was bothering you . Okay , so I did not tell you about the poppers . You did not tell me about the baby . Does that mean I get to hit you now ? I would not advise that . Oh ? You do not scare me , missy . Okay . You scare me a little . You want the truth ? I was taking that crap from Noranti ... to forget you . But you gotta admit it 's kind of romantic . I 'm just crazy about you . So , it 's my fault ? No . What ? You should have been stronger . Oh , God , Aeryn , please ! Get ... honey , give me a break ! I 'm weak . I 'm human . I 'm a guy . What is the matter ? Aeryn , I 'm fine . We 're gonna be fine . No . We 're not . Aeryn , do not walk away . Much as I love it when you walk away . Aeryn ! We 're gonna be fine . She likes me . Wow ! That 's much better . ( giggles ) Fits great . It looks nice . Mmm . It looks , uh ... sexy . What is " sexy " ? Oh , a girl as beautiful as you shouldn 't ... shouldn 't have to ask that . Sexy is , um ... Sexy . You like sexy ? Yeah . It 's my , uh ... It 's my favorite color . Makes you feel good knowing men want you . Oh , sorry I ... M-Most men aren 't ... aren 't like those traders . Most men are , uh ... are pretty drad . You like men for sex ? They 're , uh ... they 're good for other things . But they 're great for sex . Just men ? You like this ? Is this sex ? It 's ... it 's getting pretty close . Chiana . Okay , what is your problem ? That the only reason why you brought her aboard ? So you can make her your toy now ? Uh ... We were just talking . Girl stuff . Oh , come on . I get feisty . I 'm not like you . You don 't need it . I do . It 's not a crime . This is excessive , even for you , Chiana . Well , if you 're not into it , I could always ask Crichton . You mind ? Do what you want . ( Crichton whistling ) Hey ! Hey , how you doin ' ? Come on in . Uh , sorry about the mess . Chocolate ? It 's fresh from Earth . Don 't be afraid . Come on in . We 're friends . For sex ? ( chuckles ) No . That 's a different kind of friend . That 's a special friend . ( laughs ) A special friend . Like you and Aeryn . How did you ... Oh . Chiana , right ? Chiana , yes . But I can see it for myself . Anyone can . You are hers and she is yours . Or am I wrong ? No , you 're right . You 're absolutely right . ( both laugh ) These maps look legitimate . Information about the dangerous sectors is accurate . It should be easy for us to evade them . Looks like the old witch actually did a good job . Don 't I get any credit ? What for ? ( chuckles ) Look closely at that . Read me the amount . 100 crindars . It 's really only a twelfth of that . I added the extra digit . Fine handiwork , don 't you think ? You cheated the Traders ? That 's right . More for me . Do you know what you 've done , you selfish little trot ? ! The traders control this part of Tormented Space ! The greebols won 't even notice . They will notice , you lying , cheating , little ... Fellas , knock it ... knock it off ! Break ! Break ! Neutral corners . What is the problem ? This little piece of dren gave the traders counterfeit crindars . Not counterfeit , just altered . Sparky , what do you wanna do that for ? These are not the guys we wanna piss off . We have to be out here for a while and we need to be able to do business . And now he 's ruined that for us . When they find out they 've been cheated ... I 'm telling you they won 't . Those forgeries would fool anyone . Ryg , you can 't do stuff like this . You 're jamming us up . Crichton , can 't you see the damage he has done us ? When they come for us , I 'm gonna give them you ! They can enjoy you as much as they like ! D , it 's not gonna solve the problem . Relax . Have a seat . Have a bite to eat . Get away from those ! They 're mine ! You selfish little dren ! ( snarling ) Chill ! Chill , huh ? It 's under control . All right ? We 're gonna make it right . We 're gonna phone these guys , we 're gonna tell them we made a mistake and we 're gonna make it right . Are you fahrbot ? I 'm the captain here . I 'll deal with it . And then I 'll deal with you ! Just keep your hands off my property . D , let him ... let him go . D ! ( grunts ) Pilot , can you get that trading ship on the phone ? - I 'll try , Commander . But this area of Tormented Space is making transmissions very unreliable . You can do it , man . You 're smart enough , you 're good enough , and doggone it , people like you . Are you all right , Crichton ? What are you doing here ? I told you to stay in Chiana 's quarters . I don 't have to listen to you . No one else does . Nobody listens to you . They listen to Crichton , but not to you . Get back to those quarters or I will throw you off this ship myself ! ( hisses ) ( gasps ) Noranti seems to think that everyone 's acting very strangely . ( sighs ) And what do you think ? They are agitated . Unusually emotional . Everyone except Aeryn . She 's colder than usual . She wills herself against emotions . Like any good soldier . Chiana : You . On the table . Right now . Yeah . W-What 's gotten into you ? Nothing ... yet ! ( laughter ) Oh ... oh ... oh ... okay . I just figured out what you need . You need a cold shower . It 's okay . I asked Aeryn . - Whoo ! She said she didn 't care about ya anyway . ( mischievous chuckle ) Yes , she does . - No , she doesn 't . We 're happy . She loves me . Chiana : Oh , come on . You know you want it . John ! Oh , hey , Scorp ! Hey , Scorpy ! You wanna watch ? Crichton : Ah , there ain 't nothin here to see . We 're done . You 're leaving . Hezmana to you . What she do ? Cut ' em off ? ( growling ) Crichton : Whoa ! How about that ? Kids . ( laughing ) : Man , she 's in overdrive today . She 's not alone . How are you feeling ? Good . Never better . We got a little , uh , thing going on with the traders but , uh , that 's not a problem . We do have a problem . Your crewmates are behaving very oddly . Ah , that 's par for the course around here , grasshopper . Don 't worry about it . - Noranti does not think so . Well , Noranti imagines things . We 're fine . But you are not fine , John . Nor is Chiana , Aeryn , Rygel , D 'Argo . Your behavior has changed since that girl came onboard . You think Talika is doing a T 'raltixx ? A mind frell ? Right . Let 's go talk to her . Come on . She 's in Chiana 's quarters . No , she isn 't . She 's disappeared and we cannot find her . Aeryn : There she is . Talika ! It 's all right . It 's all right . Everything 's gonna be all right . We 're not gonna hurt you . Don 't be afraid . We got her . Tier Three Maintenance Bay . Come out , come out , wherever you are . Talika . ( whispering ) : It 's all right . We know she 's here . ( loud screech ) ( soft gasps and sighs ) What the frell happened ? I heard a scream . Yeah , me too . Then the lights went out . What is that ? What ? That . Ow . I don 't ... You got something . Right there . ( groans ) This is all your fault . You brought her onto the ship . I should have let you shoot her . In fact , I should have shot her myself . You 're not gonna hurt her . You both owe me currency . Everybody on this ship owes me , and I 've been far too patient . I want it now . Rygel , shut up . Crichton : D 'Argo ? Hey , listen up , man . Talika 's a lot more dangerous than she looks . Big surprise . Yeah , she 's ... she 's got some kind of scream that knocked us flat . We followed her to the Tier Three Bay , but ... I don 't know . She could be anywhere by now . ( screeching ) D ? D 'Argo ? ( soft gasps ) ( soft whirling ) ( clicking ) ( screeching and screaming ) ( growls ) ( growls softly ) I will kill your attacker . I promise . Noranti : Save her first ! Get her limbs ! Aeryn : I don 't understand why she 's doing this . I actually felt sorry for her , but she 's going to kill us all . We have to do something . Just ... just give me a minute , will ya ? I feel like crap . Whatever she did ... knocked the wind out of my sails . Listen , we won 't have much time . She could be anywhere , and we have to find her . Damn , woman . Would you give it a rest ? No . Look , please don 't be useless . Don 't be ... useless . John ... Oh , she got you too ? Yeah , I 'm , uh ... I 'm not exactly sure how . She must have snuck up from behind us . I don 't feel so right . ( slurring ) : Neither do I. So weak ... No , we can 't be weak . We have to pull ourselves together and we have to fight back . With what ? She kicked our asses . Just give it up . No , we can 't . We can 't ! What ? What 's with Aeryn ? D 'Argo : We just have to talk to Talika , find out why she attacked us . Pilot , do you know where she is ? The DRDs are searching , but no luck so far . Crichton : She can probably turn invisible . We 're never gonna find her . Additionally , the trading vessel has changed course and is now heading toward Moya . We cannot establish communication . Well , their intentions could be hostile . Crichton : Of course they 're hostile . Rygel screwed them . They 're coming back to screw us . Then let the traders come . We 'll ... we 'll give them everything they want . All the currency we have . It 's only brought us conflict anyway . Okay . Something very ... very weird is going on . Aeryn ... is falling apart . Rygel is ... is not greedy at all and ... and you 're giving up . And you 're not even angry . Well , I have no reason to be angry . I believe with dialogue and compromise ... ( yells ) ( gasps ) There is a reason to be angry . I really don 't see how that is gonna help ... ( gasps ) Okay . How ' bout that ? ( sighs ) ( yells ) Still not angry ? No , I 'm not . I should be ... but I 'm not . It 's ... it 's like she 's taken our strongest trait away . She didn 't take anything away from you . Okay . What ? Just ... just put them right ... right here . ( sighs ) Okay , now just ... just do it . I ... I really don 't want ... - D 'Argo , come on . I can 't in front of them . Just do it . I ... ( sighs ) No . No tingle ? No ... no nothing . That tralk has ... has taken away my sex drive . Apply pressure ... and her limbs should reattach . Crichton : Pilot , has that trader ship responded ? No . Our signal still isn 't getting through . And the trader 's vessel now appears to be ... drifting . D 'Argo : Well , with our Comms out the trader ship 's probably powered down to signal they mean no harm . Pilot , prepare the docking web to bring them aboard . Pilot , why haven 't you found that frelling Talika ? Her movements are extraordinary . The moment the DRD locates her , she 's gone again . You . This is all your fault . Aeryn ! Whoa , no , no , that 's not helping . All right . - Ooh , ooh . Settle . Sorry . ( softly gasping ) ( softly gasping ) Now we know how it ends . ( sniffs ) This is what we gotta look forward to ? Rygel : By my reckoning , we won 't have to wait that long . Don 't ... say that . We 're gonna be fine . We 're gonna be fine . We 're gonna find something , we 're gonna figure it all out and we are going to be fine . ( gasps ) What happened ? ( choking and gasping ) Diagnosan : I now have information on the symptoms you 've described . They 're caused by the Wolaxian arachnid . This creature 's touch infects its victims and stimulates exaggerated neural functioning . That sounds like us . The creature then transforms , harvests that energy from its host , stores it in membrane orbs and hides those orbs in an external nest for later consumption . Finding that nest and opening the orbs in proximity to the victims will allow reassimilation of the energy and complete recovery . What ? We ... we have to get it back . We have to know how to kill the creature . Get him back ! Killing Talika isn 't the problem . Finding the energy orb is . Really ? You think she 's not gonna try and defend her nest ? ( sighs ) What ? Relax . Noranti : Sikozu ... ( soft gasps ) No . No . No . - Hold her still . ( screams ) I was ... I was attacked . I was attacked . - We know . D 'Argo commed . It was a Wolaxian arachnid . Lie still . You 're safe now . My arm and my leg . Focus your mind on healing yourself . Your limbs may still be saved . The arachnid seeks to harvest neural energy . Why did it attack you ? Are you immune to its touch ? Yes . ( gags ) Yes . I must be immune . ( gags ) Scorpius . Yes , he 's infected but not harvested . She 's doing well , Scorpius . You may leave her now . The Scarran in him is growing stronger . Overcoming his Sebacean personality . I must stop him . Keep him from harming us . No , he will not harm us . I know him . ( growling ) You know only his Sebacean side . ( Scorpius grunting ) Kill it now ! First , we must find its orbs . Kill it now ! Forgive me , Scorpius . ( grunts ) ( mumbling ) No ! Pilot : The DRDs last saw Talika in the Neural Cluster , but they are unable to locate her nest of energy orbs . So , we 're screwed . Would ya stop talking like that ? Aeryn : Well , we can 't be like this . We have ... we have to focus . All right , I say we team up . We start in the Neural Cluster , and we search every tier ourselves . Chiana : And we 'll either find the orbs or we 'll find the chak that took ' em . Or perhaps we could persuade Talika to return the energy orbs . Rygel : Let 's " persuade " her with a Pulse Rifle . Come on . Whoa . Hang on a second . I 'm just ... dizzy . You know what the worst part of this is ? You and me . We never could get it together . Now we never will . Don 't you ever talk like that . Come on . ( engines revving ) Rygel : Captain D 'Argo , the trading ship 's engines are powering up . It must be Talika . I can 't seal the outer doors in time . You 've gotta stop her . It 's too late . The vessel has left Moya . Crichton , Aeryn , Rygel , Chiana , get aboard Lo 'La , and fast ! Aeryn , I-I can 't ... I can 't keep up . Go without me . What ? No . Forget about me and go . ( loud rumbling ) I don 't know about the rest of you , but we should probably get this done quite quickly . ( flatulence ) Damn it , boy . Make yourself useful . Come on . We 're almost within range . Their weapons aren 't charged up . They 're not taking any evasive action . Should be easy to board . We might be walking into a trap . Agreed . Okay , Rygel , you stay here and watch that scanner . If it senses any movement , comm us . This is all my fault . I 'm sorry about this . I 'll kill that tralk myself . Rygel . Any movement ? No . Just you three . Chiana : Nothing here but corpses . Oh , this is klempt . She 's gotta be here . Oh ... frell . ( electronic beeps ) The guidance system 's been activated . This ship is set to fly itself . She never left Moya . D 'Argo : John , the trader ship is empty . Talika used it as a decoy . So , she wasn 't there ? No . She must still be aboard Moya . We 're heading back now , but ... but we 're very weak . You have to find those energy orbs . We 're all dead without them . Noranti : Get up ! ( grunts and groans ) Now , are you ready to die ? Are you ready to watch Aeryn die ? Now Crichton , without those orbs ... She could have hid them anywhere . Moya 's huge . We 'll never find ' em . That 's it ! Talika is the only one who knows where they are . Yeah , so we 're dead . She 's never gonna tell us . No , no . But maybe we can get her to show us where they are . Now , Scorpius is infected but not yet harvested . Why not ? Well , I made him unconscious . Now , perhaps she can 't sense him , even though he is ripe and ready for her . So , we ... wake him up , use him as bait , let her harvest his mojo . And then we follow her , and we find all the orbs . What about Sikozu ? Well , she 's strong enough to help , I 'm sure . D ! Crichton : We may not be dead . ( softly ) : Yet . Well , sounds like you 're almost back to your old self . We should , uh ... we should be back to you within an arn . Sikozu : Here , swallow this . Wake up . Scorpius . We need you . ( snarls ) ( gasps ) ( snarling ) ( Sikozu gasping ) You don 't want to hurt me , Scorpius . I 'm an ally . Sikozu ? Yes . Scorpius . ( growls ) ( whimpering ) Arachnid . Kill it ? Yes . Scorpius . It 's time to kill it . ( Sikozu shrieks ) Help . ( gasps ) What 's your hurry , old one ? Keep away from me . I don 't want you . You 're old and bitter . You know who I do want . Where is he ? I don 't know anything . Liar ! You know where he is . Scorpius . Tell me or you die . If I don 't tell you , you die . You need his energy when you 're starving , and you can 't find him . Come ! I sense him . Close . ( Scorpius growling ) ( growling ) ( guttural growl ) ( snarling ) ( snarling ) ( screaming ) Crichton ... The arachnid is harvesting Scorpius . Stay with ' em if you can . ( gasping ) Found it . Tier Seven , in Cargo Bay . I 'm never gonna make it . ( grunting ) I know you can see me . Bad guys always see me . 'Cause my plans suck . People die . It 's always a mess . Talika : Crichton . Yeah , that 's me . Dumb ass . I help someone and they screw me . I have no remorse . You are food , and I eat . There 's always an excuse , lady . Are the others coming to ... attack ? Oh , I don 't ... I don 't think so . It 's just ... you and me . I was planning on ... grabbing those ' nads there , but I guess you 're not gonna let me do that , are you ? I 'm tired of this . Why don 't we just ... end it ? ( sighing ) : Come on . I 'm ... I 'm tired . I 'm tired of worrying . I 'm tired of fighting . Just ... bring it on . End it now . Do you want me to kill you ? Yes , please . Fast . Slow . Lady 's choice . I like it slow . Oh , God , I was afraid you were gonna say that . Bring it on . I already have . Crichton , don 't let her ! ( screaming ) ( screeching ) ( hissing ) Whoa . Freaky . ( hissing ) Get the orbs ! ( hissing ) Crichton : Hurry it up ! Can 't hold her off much longer ... ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( panting ) Along came a spider . Exploded beside her . Rygel : Oh , excellent , Noranti . Best roasted spider soup I ever ate . It 's the only spider soup I ever ate , but it 's really quite good . Are you feeling like your old selves again ? Hey ! Rygel obviously is . How about you ? Still affected ? You don 't seem very angry . ( chuckles ) Would you like me to show you how angry I am ? Sikozu : What is worse ? Having us see that you are half-Scarran , or remembering it yourself ? ( sighs ) I know what I am , Sikozu . This incident was simply a fortuitous , though troubling , reminder . If you want my help , the price is inclusion and honesty . Do you have any idea what you 've done ? You won the coin toss . But we lost , didn 't we ? Aeryn , it 's over . So your mind is now so full of this dren that you can 't even see straight . Is that it ? Move on , Aeryn . You see , I did everything ... everything I could to keep us together . I did exactly what you told me to do and the whole time , you have been cheating . Yeah , I 'm a coward . Move on . It 's over . No , I 'm gonna tell you how this gonna go from now . You are gonna stop sniffing this dren . Shut up ! - Don 't you tell me to shut up . Pilot ! My Comms are a bit buggy . Can you test the system , please ? Yes , Commander , but that will take all Comms off-line for about 30 microts . I thought so . That 'll be fine . Thank you . Shut up and listen to me . Scorpius is here , looking for the key to what is inside my head . The neural chips , Aurora Chair , threatening Earth . None of it works because he does not understand me . Stop using him as an excuse ... - Please ! You 're the key . My Achilles . You . If he figures that out , the world and all that 's in it is nothing . He will use you and the baby and I will not be able to stop him . So you think he 's been using the Comms ? Look what it 's done to you . You 're completely paranoid . Scorpius ( over Comms ) : Pilot , are we having a problem with the Comms ? Pilot : I was just checking them . Some slight irregularities , but they appear to be functioning normally . So , it 's over ? It 's over . There 's nothing more between us ? Nothing .

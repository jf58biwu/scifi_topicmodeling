I WAS BUSY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING , OKAY ? FOR SOMETHING ? WELL , WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THAT 'S SO IMPORTANTYOU 'VE GOT TO INTERRUPT THE TIME THAT I 'M SPENDING IN THERE WITH MY DAD ? THAT . YOUR DAD GAVE ME THAT A LONG TIME AGO . TOLD ME TO GIVE IT TO YOU IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO HIM . SO YOU 'D ... KNOW EVERYTHING .

I MEAN , OF COURSE YOU WOULD , IT 'S ... I JUST THINK YOU NEED TO READ THAT LETTER BEFORE YOU TALK TO YOUR FATHER . IT 'S BEEN OPENED . DID YOU READ IT ? THEY CAME THROUGH VALHALLA LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT THEY DIDN 'T WANT YOU TO HAVE . I MADE IT A POINT TO MEMORIZE IT ALL , SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE LETTER , I COULD BE HIS LETTER TO YOU . JEREMIAH , IF YOU 'RE READING THIS LETTER , THEN YOU KNOW THAT I AM DEAD . I 'M SORRY THAT I DIDN 'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN .

I LOVE YOU , AND THAT I 'VE MISSED YOU , AND I HAVE SO MUCHTO APOLOGIZE FOR , BUT MOST OF ALL , JEREMIAH , I DON 'T WANT TO LEAVE YOUWITH ANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE . WHEN YOU 'VE FINISHED READING THIS LETTER ... JEREMIAH , I HOPE YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART TO FORGIVE ME , BECAUSE IT WAS MY ... MY FAULT THAT ... YOUR MOTHER DIED . ( KNOCKING ) YO . THE DINNER FOR YOUR DAD 'S ABOUT TO START . YOU COMING ? YEAH , I 'LL BE THERE . ALL RIGHT . ( LAUGHTER ) AND I REMEMBERONE OTHER TIME , I GUESS JEREMIAH MUST 'VE BEEN ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLD , I 'D BEEN INVITED TO A CONVENTION IN PARIS . WE--WE GOT TO THE HOTEL , WE CHECKED IN , AND WE FOUND A NICE LITTLE RESTAURANT JUST AROUND THE CORNER . SO WE WENT THERE , WE HAD OUR MEAL , PAID OUR BILL . WE LEFT . JEREMIAH WAS SUCH A QUIET AND GOOD LITTLE BOY , THAT WE DIDN 'T EVEN REALIZEHE WAS THERE UNTIL WE GOT BACK TO THE HOTEL AND WE NOTICED THAT WE 'D LEFT HIM BACK AT THE RESTAURANT UNDER THE TABLE IN HIS BASSINET . SO WHAT HAPPENED ? WELL , WE WENT BACK THERE , AND HE WAS STILL THERE UNDER THE TABLEIN HIS BASSINET HAVING DINNERWITH ANOTHER COUPLE . THIS IS WHY I HAVE ABANDONMENT ISSUES . IT WAS HILARIOUS . THE ONLY PERSON WHO WASN 'T LAUGHING ... WAS JEREMIAH . MARY USED TO CALL HIM GRANDPA , BECAUSE HE WAS SO DAMN SERIOUS , BUT I 'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING , JEREMIAH , IT WAS--IT WAS THOSE MOMENTS , IT WAS THOSE LITTLE THINGS , THOSE LITTLE EMBARRASSING FUNNY MOMENTS , THAT GOT ME THROUGH ALL THAT . I USED TO PLAY THEM OVER AND OVER IN MY HEAD , UNTIL THE DAY I FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE STILL ALIVE ... AND NOW , I JUST WANT TO HEAR ALL THE OTHER STORIES I WASN 'T AROUND FOR . YOU 'RE ON . WELL , LADIES , GENTLEMEN , KURDY . HEY . IT 'S LATE , AND I 'M GOING TO BED . OF COURSE , I 'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO , BUT THE SUN COMES UP PRETTY EARLY AROUND HERE . YEAH , WE 'RE HALF A MILE DEEP INSIDE A MOUNTAIN . DETAILS . THE LAST DAYWE SAW EACH OTHER , JEREMIAH , DO YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY ? BACK IN LESS THAN AN HOUR . BUT WHY CAN 'T WE COME ? YOU CAN 'T COME , SON . IT 'S TOO DANGEROUS . HALF THE ROADS ARE BLOCKED , THE LAB 'S UNDER ARMED GUARD , SO YOU KEEP THE LIGHTS OFF , AND THE DOOR LOCKED.DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? OKAY , SWEETHEART , I LOVE YOU . YOU LOOK AFTER YOUR LITTLE BROTHER FOR US , OKAY ? COME ON , HONEY , WE 'VE GOT GO . I KNOW . WE 'RE GOING TO GRAB THE FILES AND GET OUT BEFORE ANYONE KNOWS WE 'VE BEEN THERE , SO YOU BE READY TO GO THE MINUTE WE PULL UP . MOMMY 'S GOT TO GO , OKAY ? MAX HAS FOUND AN AIRSTRIP JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN . THERE 'S ONE LAST PLANE LEAVING FOR VALHALLA SECTOR , SO WE 'VE GOT TO BE ON IT , OR IT 'LL BE TOO LATE . I PROMISE , WE 'LL BE BACK IN LESS THAN AN HOUR , OKAY ? EVERYONE WAS IN A PANIC . RIOTS BREAKING OUTALL OVER THE PLACE . THE THINGS I SAW THAT DAY , I DON 'T EVERWANT TO SEE AGAIN . THE FILES CONTAINING THE TRUTHABOUT THE VIRUS PAUL AND IHAD BEEN RESEARCHINGHAD GOTTEN OUT . WE HAD TO GET THEM . I HAVE NEVER BEENAS SCARED IN MY LIFE AS I WAS ON THE ROADTHAT DAY- - NOT AFRAID FOR MYSELF , AFRAID THAT IF SOMETHINGHAPPENED TO ME , THE TRUTH WOULD FALLTHROUGH THE CRACKS , THE TRUTHTHAT WAS IN THOSE FILES , THE TRUTH ABOUTHOW THE BIG DEATH GOT OUT . IT SEEMS SO SILLY NOW , THAT PAPERS , FILES , AND DISKSWOULD MAKE EVERYTHING OKAY . NONE OF IT WOULD CHANGEWHAT WAS COMING . I 'D BEEN BARRED FROM MY OFFICEBY THE MILITARY , WHO WANTED CONTROLOF THE VIRUS , BUT THE DOORSONLY STAY CLOSED WHEN THE GUARDS STAYTO KEEP THEM CLOSED , AND IN THE PANICOF THOSE DAYS , VERY FEW PEOPLEWERE REPORTING TO WORK . I TOLD YOUR MOTHERTO KEEP THE ENGINE GOING AND BE READYTHE SECOND I CAME OUT . I NEVER MADE IT THAT FAR . DOING ANY BETTER ? NO . WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ? NO . OKAY . WHAT , THAT 'S IT ? YOU JUST GONNA GO ? I THOUGHT YOU HAD SOME SPINE . I DO . I JUST HAVE THIS LITTLE RULE THAT I DON 'T GO WHERE I 'M NOT WANTED . I 'M TRYING TO MAKE A DECISION , OKAY ? AND IT 'S JUST HARD , THAT 'S ALL . I MEAN , I KNOW WHAT I SAID . I KNOW WHAT I TOLD MARKUS , AND THAT WHOLE STUPID COUNCIL , ABOUT BEING BEHIND THE ALLIANCE AND WANTING TO BRING MY BABY UP IN A BETTER WORLD , AND ALL , BUT ... BUT WHAT ? I 'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS . ABOUT THE ALLIANCE ? ABOUT MY BABY . I DON 'T KNOW IF I WANT TO HAVE IT . YOU DON 'T MEAN THAT , THEO . NO ? LOOK AT THE WORLD , ERIN . IS THIS THE KIND OF PLACE YOU WANT TO BRING UP A BABY ? WE 'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME . WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU . YEAH , WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT ME . I RAN CLAREFIELD , ERIN . I GOT TO SEE PEOPLE BRINGING BABIES INTO THE WORLD LEFT , RIGHT , AND CENTER . WHEN YOU DON 'T HAVE TV OR THE INTERNET , YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME MAKING BABIES , AND I GOT TO SEE THEMCOME INTO THE WORLD , AND IT WAS LIKE ... IT WAS LIKE THEY HAD THIS LOOK IN THEIR EYE WHEN THEY BECAME PEOPLE . THEY 'D LOOK AROUND LIKE , " THIS WASN 'T THE WORLD I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET . " THEY LOOK IN YOUR EYES , AND YOU WANT TO CRY . I 'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT TEARS WERE GOOD FOR THE SOUL . A BABY HAS GOT TO HAVE HOPE . I THOUGHT THAT 'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO HERE , BUILD A WORLD BASED ON HOPE . YOU 'RE TRYING , SURE . DONE IT ? NOT BY A LONG SHOT . NOT BY A LONG FREAKING SHOT . NOW , I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL- - STOP IT . STOP WHAT ? STOP LOOKING BACKWARD . IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERYBODY IS SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH TIME LOOKING BACKWARD AND NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TIME LOOKING FORWARD . YOU 'RE HAVING A BABY , THEO . THAT MEANS YOU LOOK FORWARD , BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT BABIES ARE FOR , TO HELP US THINK ABOUT TOMORROW . LOOK , ERIN- - IT 'S ALWAYS BEEN HARD . EVERY GENERATION HAS CONTEMPLATED WHETHER THEY SHOULD BRING THE NEXT GENERATION ON BOARD THE PLANET . I KNOW THAT , BUT I 'M JUST TRYING- - BUT WHAT ? I 'M TRYING TO SAY THAT 'S NOT THE POINT . OKAY , THEN WHAT IS THE POINT ? 'CAUSE I 'M SITTING RIGHT HERE . TALK TO ME . OKAY , FINE . WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT , YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME . WHAT HAPPENED , HAPPENED , THEO , AND I 'M , LIKE , THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO SHOULD BE TELLING YOU TO GET OVER IT , BUT ... GET OVER IT , BECAUSE GETTING BOGGED DOWNIN THE PAST NEVER DID ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY . HEY , JEREMIAH , WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT WHAT WE 'D SAYTO OUR PARENTS IF WE EVER GOT A CHANCETO SEE THEM AGAIN . YEAH . AND FOR US , IT 'S JUST A DREAM , BUT YOU GOT THE REAL DEAL , MY MAN . I 'M HAPPY FOR YOU . A LITTLE JEALOUS ... BUT I 'M ALSO PISSED AT THE WAY THINGS WORKED OUT , JEREMIAH . I KNOW AT THIS POINT , VERY LITTLE OF IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU . WE 'VE HAD OUR UPS AND DOWNSLATELY , BUT ... I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ME AND YOU ARE COOL . I JUST HAVE SOME THINGSI NEED TO WORK OUT . MUST BE COOL WITH YOU AND YOUR DAD , THOUGH . YEAH ... IT 'S--IT 'S GREAT . WHEN I AWOKE , AFTER THEY CAPTURED ME , I WAS IN VALHALLA SECTOR . WE WERE ALL THERE TOGETHER , IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST . DID YOU FIND A WAY OUT ? NOW THEY 'VE GOT EVERYONE INSIDE , THEY 'VE SET THE DOORS ON A TIME-LOCK . THEY WON 'T OPEN AGAIN FOR SIX MONTHS . THEY 'RE 10 FEET THICK , HARDENED STEEL , CONCRETE , LEAD- - AND AFTER SIX MONTHS ? MY GUESS IS THEY WON 'T ALLOW ANYONE OUT ON FOOT . MAYBE A COUPLE OF CHOPPERS WILL GO OUT AND RECONNOITER , BUT THEY WON 'T LAND , AND THEY NEED ME HERE , SO THEY 'LL NEVER LET ME OUT . WELL , MAYBE THEY 'LL LET ME OUT . THEY MIGHT , BUT THEY 'D NEVER LET YOU BACK IN AGAIN . I DON 'T CARE . AT LEAST WE COULD FIND OUT ABOUT THE BOYS . I--I--I COULD GET WORD BACK TO YOU SOMEHOW . MARY , IT 'S 3,000 MILES AWAY . YOU 'D HAVE TO WALK . YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT 'S OUT THERE WAITING FOR YOU . IT 'D BE SUICIDE . THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO . WE CAN 'T JUST GIVE UP , DEVON . WE WON 'T . WE 'LL NEVER STOP LOOKING FOR THEM . WE 'LL NEVER STOP . WE WEREN 'T THE ONLY ONES THERE AGAINST OUR WILL . ALONG WITH US WAS PAUL WEILL , THE CREATOR OF THE VIRUS , AND THE MAN RESPONSIBLEFOR THE BIG DEATH . PAUL WAS MY FRIEND , AND HE WAS EZEKIEL 'S FATHER , AND HE WAS A GOOD MAN . FOR PAUL , EVERYTHING WAS ACADEMIC . FORMULAS TO BE CRACKED , DNA TO BE DECODED , THE KIND OF GUYWHO RESEQUENCESRIBONUCLEIC ACID IN HIS HEADFOR FUN . A CERTIFIED GENIUS ... BUT THERE 'S A FINE LINEBETWEEN GENIUS AND MADNESS . AS THE DAYS PASSED , AND THE BIG DEATH FINISHEDTHE LAST OF ITS RAMPAGEOUTSIDE , THE NARROW CONFINESOF VALHALLA SECTOR WERE ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE NARROW THAN THE WALLSOF HIS CONSCIENCE ... CLOSING IN . MORNING , PAUL . HOW YOU FEELING ? DID YOU SLEEP ALL RIGHT ? NO , I ... I DON 'T SLEEP ANYMORE . ANY WORD FROM THE OUTSIDE ? NO . NOTHING . IT LOOKS LIKEWE 'RE ON OUR OWN , AT LEAST FORTHE FORESEEABLE FUTURE . THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE . ISN 'T THAT A WONDERFUL PHRASE , HUH , DEVON ? WE ALWAYS FOOL OURSELVES INTO THINKING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE PAST THE HORIZON , BUT IT 'S ALWAYS BEEN A LIE , BECAUSE IF WE ACTUALLY DID SEE PAST IT , WE WOULD SEE THAT THERE IS NO FUTURE . NOT AFTER WHAT I DID . PAUL , YOU 'VE GOT TO STOP THIS . YOU CAN 'T LET YOURSELF DROWN IN SELF-PITY . YOU GIVE THESE PEOPLE AN OPENING , THEY WILL WALK RIGHT IN AND TAKE WHAT THEY WANT , AND WE CAN 'T HAVE THAT . NO- - AND WE CAN 'T GIVE THEM THE KEY TO THE VIRUS . WHAT 'S DONE IS DONE . IF WE GIVE IT TO THEM , IT 'LL JUST ... IT 'LL JUST KEEP COMING BACKAGAIN AND AGAIN . YOU 'VE GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING , PAUL . YOU 'VE GOT TO BE STRONG , IF NOT FOR YOURSELF , THEN AT LEAST FOR SIMON . SIMON ... YEAH . DID YOU KNOW THAT I READ TO HIM EVERY NIGHT FROM THE BIBLE ? WE JUST STARTED THE BOOK OF EZEKIEL . I THINK HE LIKES IT . HE THINKS IT 'S A BEDTIME STORY . AND THEN HE ASKS ME WHEN WE CAN GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY . WHAT DO I TELL HIM ... WHEN HE ASKS ME THAT ... DEVON ? WHAT REMARKABLE LIECOULD I POSSIBLY SAY TO COMFORT HIM ? AND ME ... AHEM . YOU REALLY SHOULDN 'T KEEP YOUR DOOR OPEN . YOU , UH ... YOU DON 'T KNOWWHO COULD COMEWALKING IN HERE . YEAH , WE CAN 'T HAVE THAT , NOW , CAN WE ? WHY 'D YOU GIVE ME THAT LETTER ? BECAUSE I WANTED YOUTO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHICH WAY TO GO . IT WAS FOR YOUR SAKE , BUT MOSTLY FOR DEVON 'S . HE 'S HAD TO CARRY AROUND THIS- - THIS BURDEN FOR A REALLY LONG TIME , AND LIKE YOU , HE HAS TO MOVE FORWARD , BUT HE CAN 'T DO THAT UNLESS YOU LET HIM . ERIN TELLS ME YOU USED TO WRITE LETTERS TO YOUR DAD . WHY ? TO TELL HIM THINGSTHAT I THOUGHT HE ... WOULD WANT TO KNOW . IT KEPT HIM ALIVE . THEN YOU BURNED THEM ... FOR CLOSURE . WHAT 'S YOUR POINT ? DO YOU STILL WRITE LETTERS TO YOUR DAD AND BURN THEM ? THERE 'S NO REASON TO . I DIDN 'T ASK YOU IF THERE WAS A REASON , I ASKED YOU IF YOU WERESTILL DOING IT . SOMETIMES . WHY ? HE 'S ALIVE . HE 'S HERE . WHY WRITE HIM A LETTER AND BURN IT ? IT 'S EASIER . I ... I KNOW WE HAVETO TALK ABOUT ITEVENTUALLY . WHEN YOU 'RE READY . WHEN I 'M READY . SO NOW THATYOU KNOW THE TRUTH , I GUESS YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO WAIT ... TO LET COME TO YOUAND TALK TO YOUWHEN HE 'S READY . WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ? I DON 'T KNOW YET . I DON 'T KNOW . YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY . FOR WHAT ? FOR BEING A WITCH . SORRY , TRUTH HURTS . WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF ? I 'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING , OKAY ? I 'M NOT AFRAID OF THE WORLD , I 'M NOT AFRAID OF THE FUTURE . THEN WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF ? I 'M AFRAID I MIGHT MAKE A ROTTEN MOTHER . OKAY ? I DON 'T KNOW HOW TO BE A MOTHER . I 'M A WARRIOR . I WAS OUT THERE KICKING ASS AND TAKING NAMES AND MAKING A WAY FOR MYSELF WHILE YOU WERE SITTING IN HERE SIPPIN ' ON TEA FOR 16 YEARS . YOU 'RE A FIGHTER . ALL THE WAY , BECAUSE I HATE TO FAIL . AND NOW , YOU 'RE AFRAID YOU 'RE GOING TO FAIL AT THIS , IS THAT IT ? I DON 'T WANT O RAISE SOMEBODY THAT 'S GOING TO COME OUT AS SCREWED UP AS I AM , OKAY ? AND I DON 'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY TO RAISE A KID , ERIN . ALL I HAVE TO OFFER IS WHAT I AM , AND WHAT I GOT , AND I JUST DON 'T KNOW IF THAT 'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH . IT IS , THEO . YES , YOU 'RE AFRAID . IT 'S NATURAL TO BE AFRAID . IT JUST MEANS YOU 'RE GOING TO TRY DAMNED HARD NOT TO SCREW UP . I 'M A WARRIOR . SO AM I , AND WE 'RE BOTH SURVIVORS , BUT WHAT ARE WESURVIVING FOR ? CAN 'T YOU SEE ? WE 'RE SHAPING THE WORLDFOR THE FUTURE , BUT THE FUTURE WE 'RE BUILDING IS HERE . IT 'S NOT BEHIND THE BARREL OF A GUN . IT 'S NOT THE RESULTOF ONE MAN KEEPINGANOTHER MAN DOWN . IT 'S NOT THE POLITICS . THIS IS THE FUTURE . WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO , YOU DON 'T HAVE TO DO IT ALONE . OVER THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED , THEY KEPT AFTER US , GRINDING US DOWN , TRYING TO GETTHE INFORMATION THAT WE HAD . WE HELD OUT AS BEST WE COULD , BUT WE PAID THE PRICE ... PAUL , ME , YOUR MOTHER . ANY NEWS FROM THE LATEST SEARCH PARTY ? NO . NOTHING . DEVON ? THEY SENT OUT SOME DRONES TO DO AERIAL SURVEILLANCE OVER VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY . I SAW THE HOUSE . I SAW THE BACKYARD , WHERE THE SWING SET IS . I SAW THE FRONT PORCHWHERE MICHAEL FELL OVER AND CHIPPED HIS TOOTH . I SAW EVERYTHING , BUT I DIDN 'T SEE THE BOYS . THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE IF THEY 'RE EVEN STILL- - THEY 'RE ALIVE , DEVON . HOW CAN YOU BE SURE ? BECAUSE I CAN FEEL IT . THE SAME WAY EVERY MOTHER CAN FEEL IT . WE KNOW , DEVON . I KNOW . THE SAME WAY I KNOW THAT WE WILL SEE OUR BOYS AGAIN . OKAY ? YEAH . HEY . WE WILL . NOW , GET SOME SLEEP . WE HELD OUT AS BEST WE COULD , BUT IN THE END , IS IT ANY WONDER THAT PAUL BEGANTO FRAY AT THE EDGES ? I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING . I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING . WE 'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING , PAUL . WE 'VE GOT TO FIND SOME WAY OUT OF HERE . IN ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS , THEY 'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE DOORS , THERE 'S GOING TO BE RECON TEAMS OUT THERE . IT 'S OUR LAST CHANCE . HOW ? YOU THINK THEY 'RE GOING TO LET THE MAN WHO CREATEDTHE VIRUS AND THE ONLY OTHER MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS IT JUST WALK OUT THE FRONT DOOR ? THEY 'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE NUMBER FIVE RECYCLING SYSTEM . THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO IT IS THROUGH AN AIR SHAFT THAT LEADS STRAIGHTTO THE SURFACE . THEY 'VE HAD IT SEALED UP UNTIL NOW . THEY 'LL SEAL IT AGAINAFTER THEY 'VE FIXED IT . IT 'S TOO RISKY . WE 'VE GOT TO TRY ! IF BOTH OF US TRY A MOVE LIKE THAT , WE WILL GET CAUGHT . AND WE 'LL NEVER GET OUT OF HERE . AT LEAST , NOT ALL OF US . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? YOU GO . NO . DEVON , LISTEN TO ME . ABSOLUTELY NOT . I CAN CREATE A DIVERSION , MAKE TIME FOR YOU AND MARY BOTH TO MAKE IT OUT OF HERE , BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU 'LL TAKE SIMON WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO . I CAN 'T STAND THE IDEA OF HIM GROWING UP INSIDE THIS PLACE . I 'M NOT LEAVING YOU HERE ON YOUR OWN . HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT THEY WILL DO TO YOU ? NO , DEVON ... IT 'S ALREADY BEEN DONE . FOR YEARS , SCIENTISTS HAD DONE STUDIES ON THE STRESS CREATEDBY LIVING IN CLOSE QUARTERS , UNDERGROUND , FOR PROLONGED PERIODS , BUT NO ONE HADEVER BEEN TESTED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCESLIKE THIS , NOT WITH THE ADDED BURDENPAUL WAS CARRYING , WHAT HE 'D DONE , WHAT WE WERE PLANNING . IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BEA DIVERSION , NOTHING MORE . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? WEILL 'S KILLED FIVE OFFICERS , AND CLOSED HIMSELF OFF WITH THREE MORE , ALL WOUNDED ! THAT WASN 'T WHAT WE AGREED TO . DEVON , WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND TRY TO STOP HIM- - THERE ISN 'T TIME ! WE HAVE TO GO NOW . IT 'S OUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF HERE . COME ON , DR. WEILL , PUT DOWN THE GUN DOWN.YOU DON 'T WANT TO DO THIS . YOU 'D BE SURPRISED . JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN . STAY BACK . I MEAN IT ! WHERE 'S MY DAD ? SHH . YOU SHOULDN 'T BE DOWN HERE . OH , HEY , WE GOT TURNED AROUND SOMEWHERE- - WE HAVE A BLIPIN SHAFT FIVE . REPEAT , BLIP IN SHAFT FIVE . MOVING TO INTERCEPT . DON 'T KNOW IF WE CANGET THERE IN TIME . WE NEED BACK UP . SOMEONE GET DOWNHERE NOW . YOU THOUGHT YOU 'D WON , BUT YOU LOSE . I KILLED THE WORLD , MAN . I KILLED THE WHOLE FREAKING WORLD ! YOU THINK I 'M GOING TO WORRY ABOUT YOU ? SIMON , DROP THE BOOK . JUST FORGET THE BOOK ! NOW , WHAT I ... WHAT I KNOW ENDS HERE . WHAT I DISCOVERED CANNOT BE USED TO TERRORIZE MANKIND AGAIN . YOU THOUGHT I COULDN 'T STOP YOU , BUT I CAN ! I ... I HAVE ... NO ONE LEFT . NO ONE LEFT BUT ME . NO ! KEEP GOING , SIMON , JUST KEEP GOING . KEEP GOING ! SIMON , DON 'T LOOK DOWN . STOP WHERE YOU ARE ! I WILL FIRE ! DEVON ! DEVON , I CAN 'T HOLD ON ! HANG ON , HANG ON . I CAN 'T HOLD- - DEVON ! IT WON 'T OPEN . IT WON 'T OPEN ! WHEN PAUL WAS GONE , THEY CONCENTRATEDTHEIR EFFORTS ON ME , BECAUSE I WAS THEIR LAST HOPE . WHAT THEY DID TO ME , I ... I CAN 'T DESCRIBE . AFTER A WHILE , THEY REALIZED I WASN 'T GOINGTO GIVE THEM ANYTHING . DIDN 'T STOP THEM FROM TRYING , BUT THEY HAD NOTHINGTO HOLD OVER ME . NOT YOU , NOT MARY . NOTHING . PAUL WAS RIGHT . YOU WERE RIGHT . I AM AFRAID , BUT NOT JUST OF THE FUTURE . THE RIGHT FUTURE , THE ONE THATWE HAVE TO BUILD , IS ONE WHERE THE ... WHERE THE BIG DEATHIS NO LONGERSOMETHING TO FEAR , A MEMORY . THAT 'S WHAT I HADTO MAKE SURE OF , THAT IT WAS A MEMORY . FOR YOU , FOR HER , FOR ALL THE UNBORN CHILDREN . HER DEATH IS ON MY HANDS . MY BABY 'S LIFE IS IN MY HANDS . IF I HAD BEEN STRONGER , IF I HADN 'T LET GO , IF I 'D TRIED ANOTHER WAY ... I 'M ASHAMED OF WHAT I DID . I 'M AFRAID OF WHAT I MIGHT DO . THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLDDESERVE A FUTURE WITHOUT FEAR . WHAT DO I DO IF I SCREW UP ? ALL WE CAN DO IS GET ONWITH THE BUSINESS OF LIVING , BURY OUR DEAD , RAISE OUR CHILDREN , HOPE FOR A BETTER WORLD . I JUST DON 'T KNOW IF I CAN GIVE MY BABY THE WORLD ... THAT HE DESERVES . WELL ... ALL WE CAN DO IS TRY , AND I HOPE YOU CAN TRYTO FORGIVE ME , JEREMIAH . I 'M SORRY . HI . HI . I , UH , I 'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU . I COULDN 'T FIND YOU . YOU OKAY ? YEAH , I 'M GOOD .

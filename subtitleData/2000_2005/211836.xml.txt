 Previously on Farscape ... What 's he doin here ? What 's he want ? He wants asylum . A relationship ... is based on trust . I didn 't want to tell you about the pregnancy until I was sure . Distilate of Laka . One whiff ... and the pain is gone . It 's to help him move on . Surmount his feelings and forget . And now , on Farscape ... Pilot . Why is that trading vessel still aboard ? The negotiation is proving ... difficult . These traders are asking exorbitant prices for their maps . Yet we dare not traverse Tormented Space without reliable star charts . For five thousand crindars ... I want maps that are current and authentic . I said ten . And she said five . Buy your maps elsewhere . Are you so sure another buyer will come along ? What ? Nothing 's bothering me . Something I said ? It must have been something I said . Nine thousand . No more talk . Except to say goodbye . - Wait ! - No . Seven . Final offer . The Dominar will pay you . You lookd unusually smug . Your deal , it was successful ? You have no idea . One more trade . No tricks . We enjoyed her . Plenty of good pleasure left . No value to an old woman but but to men ... Touch her again , you fekik , and you die ! Calm down . Chiana , this is not ... our problem . What ? Have you forgotten what it 's like to be a prisoner ? Eight hundred crindars ... bargain . She 's yours . We can 't just leave her . Okay . I 'll buy her myself if I have to . You brought that Vorc onto Moya , remember ? What 's your name ? Talikaa . Here 's the deal . We take her ... or I take her head off . Shoot her . She 's nothing to me . Rygel ... pay them . - But , uh ... - Pay them ! Sparky ! Cough it up . A smart purchase . You 'll have fun with her . This is a bad idea . Nine times out of ten . First nice planet we find , we drop her off . This isn 't ... no ... I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm a friend . A friend . Hey , it 's okay . Chiana ! Grab her . Take it easy . We 're not gonna hurt you . Okay , hold her . Grab her ! Okay , take her to your room . She is your responsibility . Hey ... Talikaa . Come on . I 'll get you some food and some better clothes . The trading vessel is now leaving Moya . Good ! So you 're ... angry with me ? Let 's talk . - I don 't want to talk . - Aeryn ... Subtitles by PK-SUB66 " TWICE SHY " There 's nothing to say . The hell there 's not . You hit me ! You lied to me . Hey , you lied to me ! You said nothing was bothering you . Okay , so I did not tell you about the poppers . You did not tell me about the baby . Does that mean I get to hit you now ? I would not advise that . Oh . You ... do not scare me , Missy . Okay you scare me a little . You want the truth ? I was taking that crap from Noranti ... to forget you . But you gotta admit it 's kinda romantic . I 'm just crazy about you . So , it 's my fault . No ! What ? You should have been stronger . Oh , god ! Aeryn , please ! G ... gi ... Honey , give me a break ! I 'm weak . I 'm human . I 'm a guy . What is the matter ? Aeryn , I 'm fine . We 're gonna be fine . No . We 're not . Aeryn ... do not walk away . Much as I love it when you walk away . Aeryn ! We 're gonna be fine ! She likes me . That 's much better . Fits great . It looks nice . It looks , uh ... sexy . What is ' sexy ' ? Oh , a girl as beautiful as you shouldn 't ... shouldn 't have to ask that . Sexy is , um sexy . You like sexy ? Yah . It 's my ... uh ... it 's my favorite color . Makes you feel good ... knowing men want you . Oh ... um ... Sorry . M ... most men aren 't ... aren 't like those traders . Most men are , uh ... are pretty drad . You like men for sex ? They 're , uh ... they 're good for other things . But they 're great for sex . Just men ? You like this ? Is this sex ? It 's ... it 's getting pretty close . Chiana . Okay . What ... is your problem ? That the only reason why you brought her aboard ? So you can make her your toy now ? Uh we were just talkin . Girl stuff . Oh , come on . I get feisty . I 'm not like you . You don 't need it . I do.It 's not a crime . This is excessive , even for you , Chiana . Well , if you 're not into it ... I could always ask Crichton . You mind ? Do what you want . Hey ! Hey , how you doin ? Come on in . Uh ... sorry about the mess . Chocolate ? It 's fresh from Earth . Don 't be afraid . Come on in . We 're friends . For sex ? No . That 's a different kind of friend . That 's a special friend . A special friend . Like you and Aeryn . How did you ... ? Oh ! Chiana , right ? Chiana , yes ! But I can see it for myself . Anyone can . You are hers and she is yours . Or am I wrong ? No.You 're right . You 're absolutely right . These maps look legitimate . Information about the dangerous sectors is accurate , it should be easy for us to evade them . Looks like the old witch actually did a good job . - Don 't I get any credit ? - What for ? Look closely at that . Read me the amount . A hundred crindars . It 's really only a twelfth of that . I added the extra digit . Fine handiwork , don 't you think ? You cheated the traders . That 's right . More for me . Do you know what you 've done , you selfish little tralk ? The traders control this part of Tormented Space ! The greebols won 't even notice . They will notice , you lying , cheating little ... - Knock it off ! Knock it off ! Break ! Break ! - ... piece of crap ! Neutral corners . What 's the problem ? This little piece of dren gave the traders counterfeit crindars . Not counterfeit . Just altered ... Sparky ? What 'd you want to do that for ? These are not the guys we wantta piss off . We have to be out here for a while and we need to be able to do business . And now he 's ruined it for us . When they find out they 've been cheated ... I 'm telling you , they won 't . Those forgeries would fool anyone . Ryg , you can 't do stuff like this . You 're jamming us up . Crichton , can 't you see the damage he has done us ? When they come for us , I 'm gonna give them you ! They can enjoy you as much as they like ! D. That 's not going to solve the problem . Relax . Have a seat . Have a bite to eat . Get away from those . They 're mine ! You selfish little dren ! Chill . Chill , bra . It 's under control , all right ? We 're gonna make it right . We 're gonna phone these guys . We 're gonna tell ' em we made a mistake and we 're gonna make it right . Are you fahrbot ? I 'm the Captain here . I 'll deal with it , and then I 'll deal with you ! Just keep your hands off my property . D ! Let him ... let him go , D ! - Pilot . Can you get that trading ship on the phone ? - I 'll try , Commander , but this area of Tormented Space is making transmissions very unreliable . You can do it , man . You 're smart enough . You 're good enough . Doggone it , people like you . Are you alright , Crichton ? What are you doing here ? I told you to stay in Chiana 's quarters . I don 't have to listen to you . No one else does . Nobody listens to you . They listen to Crichton , but not to you . Get back to those quarters or I will throw you off this ship myself . Noranti seems to think that everyone is acting very strangely . - And what do you think ? - They are agitated . Unusually emotional . Everyone except Aeryn . She 's colder than usual . She wills herself ... against emotions . Like any good soldier . You . On the table . Right now . - Yah , wha ... wha ... what 's gotten into you ? - Nothing yet . Oh ... oh ... oh ... okay . I just figured out what you need . - You need a cold shower . - It 's okay . I asked Aeryn . She said she didn 't care about you anyway . - Yes she does . - No she doesn 't . We 're happy . She loves me . Oh , come on . You know you want it . John . Oh , hey Scorp ! Hey , Scorpy ... You wantta watch ? Nuh , hey ... aint nothin here to see . We 're done . You 're leaving . Hezmana to you . What 'd she do ... cut ' em off ? Whoa . How bout that , kids ? - Man , she 's in over-drive today . - She 's not alone . How are you feeling ? Good ! Never better . We got a little , uh ... thing going on with the traders , but , uh ... that 's not a problem . We do have a problem . Your crewmates ... are behaving very oddly . Ah , that 's ... par for the course around here , Grasshopper . Don 't worry about it . Noranti does not think so . Well , Noranti imagines things . We 're fine . But you are not fine , John . Nor is Chiana , Aeryn , Rygel or D 'Argo . Your behavior has changed ... since that girl came onboard . You think Talikaa ... is doin a T 'raltixx ? A mind frell ? Right . Let 's go talk to her . Come on . - She 's in Chiana 's quarters . - No , she isn 't . She 's disappeared ... and we cannot find her . There she is . Talikaa . It 's all right ... it 's all right . Everything 's gonna be all right . We 're not gonna hurt you . Don 't be afraid . We got her . Tier three maintenance bay . Come out , come out ... wherever you are . Talikaa ... Talikaa ... It 's all right . We know she 's here . What the frell happened ? I heard a scream . Yah ... me too . Then the lights went out . What is that ? - What ? - That . I don 't you got something ... right there . This is all your fault . You brought her onto the ship . In fact , I should have shot her myself . You 're not going to hurt her . You both owe me currency . Everybody on this ship owes me and I 've been far too patient . I want it now . Rygel ... shut up . D 'Argo ? Hey , listen up , man . Talikaa 's a lot more dangerous than she looks . Big surprise . Yah , she ... she 's got some kind of scream that knocked us flat . We followed her to the tier three bay but ... I don 't know ... She could be anywhere by now . D ? D 'Argo ? I will kill your attacker . I promise . Save her , first . Get her limbs ! I don 't understand why she 's doing this . I actually felt sorry for her , but she 's going to kill us all . We have to do something . Just g ... just give me a minute , will ya ? I feel like crap . Whatever she did s ... knocked the wind outta my sails . Listen , we won 't have much time . She could be anywhere and we have to find her . Damn , woman , would you give it a rest ? No . No , please don 't be useless . Don 't be ... useless . John ... Oh ... she got you too ? Yah , uh , I 'm ... not exactly sure how . She must have snuck up from behind us . I don 't feel so right . Neither do I. Shall we ... No . We can 't be weak . We have to pull ourselves together and we have to fight back . With what ? She kicked our asses . Just give it up . No , we can 't . We can 't ! What ? What 's with Aeryn ? We just have to talk to Talikaa , find out why she attacked us . Pilot , do you know where she is ? The DRDs are searching , but no luck so far . She can probably turn invisible . We 're never going to find her . Additionally , the trading vessel has changed course and is now heading toward Moya . We cannot establish communication . Well , their intentions could be hostile . Oh course they 're hostile ! Rygel 's screwed them , they 're coming back to screw us . Then ... let the traders come . We 'll ... we 'll give them everything they want . All the currency we have . It 's only brought us conflict anyway . Okay ... something very ... very weird is going on . Aeryn ... is falling apart . Rygel is ... he 's not greedy at all ... and you 're giving up . And you 're not even angry . Well , I have no reason to be angry . I believe with dialogue and compromise ... There is a reason to be angry . I really don 't see how that is going to help . Okay ? How about that ? Still not angry ? No , I 'm not . I should be ... but I 'm not . It 's ... it 's like she 's taken our strongest trait away . She didn 't take anything away from you . Okay ... What ? Just ... just put ' em right ... right here . Okay , now just ... just do it . - I uh ... I really don 't want ... - D 'Argo , come on . I can 't in front of them . Just do it . I ... No . No tingle ? No ... no nothin ? That tralk has ... has taken my sex drive . Apply pressure ... and her limbs should reattach . Pilot , has that trading ship responded ? No . Our signal still isn 't getting through . And , the trader 's vessel now appears to be ... drifting . Well , with our comms out , the trader ship 's probably powered down to signal they mean no harm . Pilot , prepare the docking web to bring them aboard . Pilot ? Why haven 't you located that frelling Talikaa ? Her movements are extraordinary . The moment a DRD locates her , she 's gone again . You ! This is all your fault ! Aeryn ! No , no , no . That 's not helping . - All right . - Settle . Sorry . Now we know how it ends . This is what we got to look forward to ? By my reckoning we won 't have to wait that long . Don 't ... say that . We 're gonna be fine . We 're gonna be fine . We 're gonna find something , we 're gonna figure it all out ... and we are going to be ... fine . What happened here ? I now have information on the symptoms you 've described . They 're caused by the Wolaxan Arachnid . This creature 's touch infects its victims ... and stimulates exaggerated neural functioning . That sounds like us . The creature then transforms , harvests that energy from its host , stores it in membrane orbs ... and hides those orbs in an external nest for later consumption . Finding that nest and opening the orbs in proximity to the victims ... will allow reassimilation of the energy and complete recovery . What ? We have to get it back ! We have to know how to kill the creature . Get him back ! Killing Talikaa isn 't the problem . Finding the energy orb is . Really ? You think she 's not going to try and defend her nest ? - What ? - Relax . Sikozu ... - No ... no ... - Hold ... hold her still ! I was ... I was attacked . I was attacked . We know . D 'Argo commed . It was a Wolaxian arachnid . Lie still . You 're safe now . My arm and my leg ... Focus your mind on healing yourself . Your limbs may still be saved . The arachnid seeks to harvest neural energy . Why did it attack you ? Are you immune to its touch ? Yes . Yes , I must be immune . Scorpius ? Yes , he 's infected but not harvested . She 's doing well , Scorpius . You may leave her now . The Scarran in him is growing stronger ... over-coming his Sebacean personality . I must stop him . Keep him from harming us . } No ! He will not harm us . I know him . You know only his Sebacean side . - Kill it now . - First we must find its orbs . - Kill it now ! - Forgive me , Scorpius . } No ! The DRDs last saw Talikaa in the neural cluster ... but they 're unable to locate her nest of energy orbs . So , we 're screwed . Would 'ja stop talkin like that ? Well , we can 't be like this ... we have .. we have to focus . All right , I say we team up . We start in the neural cluster and we search every tier ourselves . And we 'll either find the orbs , or we 'll find the shot that took ' em . Or , perhaps we could persuade Talikaa to return the energy orbs . Let 's ' persuade ' her with a pulse rifle . Come on . Hang on a second . I 'm just ... dizzy . You know what the worst part of this is ? You and me . We never could get it together . Now we never will . Don 't you ever talk like that ! Come on . Captain D 'Argo ! The trading ship 's engines are powering up . It must be Talikaa . I can 't seal the outer doors in time . You gotta stop her . It 's too late . The vessel has left Moya . Crichton , Aeryn , Rygel , Chiana ... get aboard LoLah and fast . Aeryn ... I ... I can 't ... can 't keep up . Go without me . What ? No ! Forget about me and go . I don 't know about the rest of you , but we should probably get this done quite quickly . Damn it , boy . Make yourself useful . Come on . We 're almost within range . Their weapons aren 't charged up and they 're not taking any evasive action . Should be easy to board . We ... might be walking into a trap . Agreed . Okay ... Rygel , you stay here and watch that scanner . If it senses any movement , comm us . This is all my fault . I 'm sorry about this . I 'll kill that tramp myself . Rygel ... any movements ? No , just you three . Nothin here but corpses . Ahh ... this is klemmpt . She 's gotta be here . Ahh ... frell . The guidance system 's been activated . This ship 's set to fly itself . She never left Moya . John ... the trader ship is empty . Talikaa used it as a decoy . So , she wasn 't there ? No . She must still be aboard Moya . We 're heading back now , but ... we 're very weak . You have ... to find ... those energy orbs . We 're all dead without them . Get ... up ! Come on . Now , are you ready to die ? Are you ready to watch Aeryn die ? - Now , Crichton , without those orbs ... - She could 've hid them anywhere . Moya 's huge . We 'll never find ' em . That 's it ! Talikaa is the only one who knows where they are . Yah , so we 're dead . She 's never gonna tell us . No , no ! But maybe we can get her to show us where they are . Now ... Scorpius is infected but not yet harvested . Why not ? Well , I made him unconscious . Now ... now perhaps she can 't sense him , even though he is ripe and ready for her . So , we ... wake him up , use him as bait ... let her harvest his mojo . And then we follow her and we find all the orbs . What about Sikozu ? Well , she 's strong enough to help , I 'm sure . D ! We may not be dead yet . Well , sounds like you 're almost back to your old self . We should , uh ... we should be back to you within an arn . Here , swallow this . Wake up ... Scorpius . We need you . You don 't want to hurt me , Scorpius . I 'm ... ally . Si .. ko .. zu ? Yes ... Scorpius . Arachnid ... Kill it . Yes , Scorpius . It 's time to kill it . Help . What 's your hurry , old one ? Keep away from me . I don 't want you . You 're old ... and bitter . - You know who I do want . Where is he ? - I don 't know anything . Liar ! You know where he is . Scorpius . Tell me or you die . If I don 't tell you , you die . You need his energy when you 're starving and you can 't find him . Come ! I sense him . Close . Crichton ? The arachnid is harvesting Scorpius . Stay with ' em , if you can . Found it . Tier seven , the cargo bay . I 'm never gonna make it . I know you can see me . The bad guys always see me . Cause my plans suck . People die . It 's always a mess . Crichton ... Yah , that 's me . The dumb ass . I help someone and they screw me . I have no remorse . You are food and I eat . There 's always an excuse , lady . Are the others coming to ah ... attack ? Oh , I don 't ... I don 't think so . It 's just ... you and me . I was planning on , uh ... grabbing those ' nads there , but I guess you 're not gonna let me do that , are ya ? I 'm tired . Let 's ... why don 't we just ... end it ? Come on ... I 'm tired . I 'm tired of worrying . I 'm tired of fighting . Just ... bring it on , end it now . Do you want me to kill you ? Yes , please . Fast , slow ... lady 's choice . I like it slow . Oh , god . I was afraid you were gonna say that . Bring it on . I already have . Crichton ! Don 't let her ! Whoa ... Freaky . Get the orbs ! Hurry it up ! I can 't hold her off ... much longer . Along came a spider ... exploded beside her . Ahh ... excellent , Noranti . Best roasted spider soup I ever ate . It 's the only spider soup I ever ate , but it 's really quite good . Are you feeling like your old selves again ? Hey ! Rygel obviously is . How about you ? Still affected ? You don 't seem very angry . Would you like me to show you how angry I am ? What is worse ? Having us see ... that you are half-Scarran ... or remembering it yourself ? I know what I am , Sikozu . This interlude was simply a fortuitous , though troubling ... reminder . If you want my help ... the price is inclusion ... and honesty . Do you have any idea what you 've done ? - You won the coin toss . - But we lost ... didn 't we ? Aeryn ... it 's over . So , your mind is now so full of this dren that you can 't even see straight , is that it ? Move on , Aeryn . You see , I did everything ... everything I could to keep us together . I did exactly what you told me to do and the whole time you have been cheating . Yah , I 'm a coward . Move on . It 's over . No , I 'm gonna tell you how this is gonna go from now . - You are going to stop sniffing this dren ... - Shut up . Don 't you tell me to shut up ! Pilot . My comms are a bit buggy . Can you test the system , please ? Yes , Commander , but that will take all comms offline for about thirty microts . I thought so . That 'll be fine , thank you . Shut up and listen to me . Scorpius is here ... looking for the key to what is inside my head . Neural chips , aurora chair , threatening Earth ... none of it works because he does not understand me . - Stop using him as an excuse . - Please ! You 're the key . My Achilles . You . If he figures that out ... the world and all that 's in it 's nothing . He will use you ... and the baby ... and I will not be able to stop him . So you think he 's been using the comms ? Look what it 's done to you . You 're completely paranoid . Pilot ? Are we having a problem with the comms ? I was just checking them . Some slight irregularities , but they appear to be functioning normally . S ... so , it 's over . It 's over . There 's nothing more between us . Nothing . Subtitles : PK SUB-66

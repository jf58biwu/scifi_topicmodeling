 A Leela of Her Own Put down the binoculars . The wall of that strip club isn 't gonna collapse twice in one day . I know . I accept that . Now I 'm interested in that new pizza parlor . Makes me pine for my days as a delivery boy . " Here 's your pizza , " I 'd say . " I didn 't order any , " they 'd say . Then off to my next adventure . That story stunk . Hand me the binoculars . The owner is from Signas-Five . Signoids ? On our block ? They should go back where they came from . Society 's never gonna make progress until we learn to pretend to like each other . Let 's make these hideous strangers feel welcome . No . You sure about these chairs ? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee . It 's okay , Mama . Anyone complains , I bend legs up for free . Customers . Welcome to Earth Pizza Store . Here , sit . I bend the knees for you . That 's comfy . What kind of pizza goes in you ? Silt ? Asbestos ? We got guano , very fresh . Have any food ? Here , try a deep-dish pizza . Contains four kinds of things . - This tastes like vomit . - Thank you . Actually , I mean to offend a little . This is awful . What 's wrong ? Was it something Leela said ? We come to Earth to start new life , raise fat , spoiled Earth kids hang many underwear from Earth clothesline , live Earthican dream . Don 't cry , foreign people . I used to work in a pizzeria . As soon as I stop blasting puke I 'm gonna teach you to sell pizza . - Thank you , magic biped . You save us , sir . If we cannot make Earth Pizza , our dream will die . Just like rats we crushed to make the wine . For starters , use quality ingredients . Case in point ? No more live bees . When you put pizzas in the oven , don 't get in with them . Hey , ocupado . Most important of all is the big-screen TV . Families need a TV so they don 't have to talk to each other . The Earthican pastime . Blernsball . Mulligan drives the ball . It 's going , going and caught by the shortstop . Mets lose again . I haven ' t seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker . This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching . Mets ? Shortstop ? Pinching the hitter ? I don 't understand this Blernsball . We 'll teach you . Your pizzeria will play a game against Planet Express . - But you 'll need nine players . - No problem . Play the ball . Go , team . Beat those no-good Signoids . Show them they stink in a game they 've never played . This is why I love Earth . Beautiful star-brightened day , friendly Blernsball game with chum pals . So pleasant for everybody . Hit by a pitch . Take your base . Sorry about that . I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches . No batter , no batter . - No batter anymore . - Take your base . I didn 't mean to hit you . I have trouble with depth perception . Yeah . Me too , now . Hey , batter , batter , batter , batter . Hey , duck . Take your base . Please , I want to live . - Can I use bat to protect head ? - Apparently not . Check out the one-eyed bean machine . Hooray , I make a score point . You beaned a run in . Better let me pitch . But I 've got a no-hitter going . You 're right . Here . Don 't take her out . She 's a firecracker . - I 'd like to talk to you . - Am I under arrest ? You 're the sleaze bag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League . Now I 'm the sleaze bag who owns the New New York Mets . The Mets ? Those bums are worse than me . But they don 't draw a crowd like you . Which is why I want to sign you . You mean , I 'd be the first woman ever to play major league blernsball ? It 'd be a publicity stunt . A one-eyed lady might bring out the freak show crowd . Wow , the first woman ever to play major league blernsball . - Again , yeah . But you 'd just be ... - Yippee ! The first woman ever to play major league blernsball . How do I look ? - Like a sexy Yogi Berra . - Why is your number 7 / 8 ? The whole numbers have been retired . I 'm impressed . You look just like a ball player . - Can I pat you on the butt ? - I 'm a professional athlete . So go ahead . Now I 'm too nervous . The Swedes have already turned this one into a " laffer " . And that 's with two " F 's . " The crowd is pouring out L.A. - style . Skipper , we 're losing the crowd . Put in our new novelty act , Leela . I already put in the circus clown . But he bunted . Clowns are only funny when they swing away . Your attention please . Now pitching for the Mets , Turanga Leela . A one-eyed woman . Come on , throw like a girl . - Go , Leela . - Too much eyeliner . This is history in the making . Bjornson steps up to the plate , and Leela delivers . Bull 's-eye . An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer . An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer . Bean ! Bean ! Bean ! Bean ! Bean ... It 's a three-bean , ball salad . The Mets fans love it , though . They haven 't had much to cheer about this year . That was great . You got more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank . Poor Tex . He was quite a shark . - Hey ! - Come on ! - I win . - Sorry . - How did you get in here ? - As your agent , I have access . - Since when are you my agent ? - Quiet ! Call coming in . Yes ? A big endorsement deal for Leela ? How much ? You put a one and two zeros in front of that , or we pass . Deal . - That 's great . How much did you get me ? - One hundred dollars ! As a pitcher , I serve up plenty of bean balls . So I know good beans when I see them . - Bean-Bay Beans ! They 're the beaniest ! - Cut ! Bean ! Bean ! Bean ! In short order , Leela has become a fan favorite . You 're the best , babe . Hang on . You put a one and two zeros in front of that , or we pass . Deal . - So , what did you get me ? - A thousand and one pesos . Cut . Now do one with the bean suit on . Leela bringing in customers . This keep up , we need to buy second sauce toilet . I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them , just like you . Will you sign ? Sure thing , sweetie . Who should I make it out to ? To eBay ? That 's a popular name today . Little " E , " big " B " ? Five bucks an autograph , 200 fans , add a one and two zeros , we got a wad . I 'm doing it for all the female athletes who need a role model . - A role model for how to stink . - What ? Who are you ? Jackie Anderson . I 'm on the team at NNYU . I was hoping to play in the majors . Following in my footsteps . God forbid ! Your freak show is making it impossible for female players to be taken seriously . I hope you 're proud of yourself . Show 's over , no refunds . You heard the robot . Get out ! Fans haven 't been cheering for me . They 've been cheering at me . Don 't be upset , Leela . You look really cute in your uniform . That 's what makes it so sad ! I thought I was doing something heroic ! You are ! What about that little girl you visited in the hospital who died ? You 're right . I can 't let people down anymore . God 's my witness , I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere ! I will become the best blernsball player of all time ! That 's statistically impossible . In 77 innings , you haven 't gotten one out . At this rate , you 'll be the worst player of all time . Then I have a new vow . I solemnly swear I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time ! Look ! The players who broke the various color barriers ! When will man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots ? If I could be just a little better than him , I can hold my head high . He once struck out when his tongue got stuck to a cold bat . - He tried to catch with an oven mitt ! - It 's a crummy hologram . I 'm not a hologram . Hank Aaron the 24th . How could you play so badly ? The original Hank Aaron was great ! I was better than great . - I was the home run king . - Neat ! So , Hank , the bad Hank , just how bad were you ? My batting average was low . Low ? It was zero ! You went your whole career without getting a hit . Leela beats that . She pitched without ever getting an out ! You stink ! Junior , she belongs in the exhibit instead of you ! Forget it ! This job 's too cushy to give up . - Wade Boggs , goes down smooth . - I don 't want to be in this exhibit . I need your help , so I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you . I can 't help you play better than Tiny lota . He was great ! But I 'll teach you all I know . - Okay , let 's see what you can do . - She can lodge a ball in your brain . You better get a batting helmet . All right , low and away . Okay , try it again . But this time , keep your eye off the ball . You mean on the ball ? - Who 's in the hall of fame ? - You 're holding the bat upside down . - Just pitch the ball ! - Okay , eye off the ball . - Strike ! - Man , you did it , Leela ! I didn 't hit the batter ! I was pitching and not just belly-itching ! Oh , you got that too ? I think there 's a rash going around . Welcome to Fenway where the Mets end a season that ranks among the worst . You opened a franchise ! Yes . Our biggest seller is Leela 's Bean Pizza ! Six kinds of beans plus things that look like beans . Beans , huh ? This is great ! How do you make the crust so fizzy ? Ancient Signoid secret . My husband , some hotshot . Here 's his ancient Signoid secret . Live hornets . We smoosh them right into dough . - I don 't care if it 's horse manure . - That 's good . I want to buy this franchise . How 's $ 1 00,000 ? No ! We come to Earth to make pizza , not money ! - No , Blek ! Other way around . - Right . Offer accepted ! Fans , Boston 's turning the last game into a real " squeeeker " . And that 's with three " E 's " ! Two men on , and they 're down to their last out . It 's my last chance to prove I 'm not the worst player ever . - Put me in . - No ! We 're actually winning this game ! You only go in as a joke when we 're eight runs behind ! Come on ! Let 's see some fundamentals out there ! And not clown fundamentals ! Darn ! Darn ! Darn ! Now the bases are loaded ! Isn 't there a man who can get one more out ? ! - I can ! - I repeat . Isn 't there a man on ... - I 've been training with Hank Aaron ! - The Hank Aaron ? - I 've trained with a Hank Aaron . - All right then get in there and pitch like you 've never pitched like you before ! Now pitching for the Mets , Turanga Leela ! - Bean ! Bean ! Bean ! - Go , Leela ! Go ! - Go , Leela ! - Put it down the pike ! Strike him out ! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere ! Your attention ! Now pinch-hitting for the Poindexters , Jackie Anderson ! Look ! College blernsball 's finest female hitter making her debut against the worst female anything . I 've never seen anything this weird and I 've seen Mr. Belvedere naked ! Keep cool . She 's like any other player . She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time . Strike one ! Strike one ! A personal best ! Strike two ! This moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks the hot dogs with experience ! A grand slam blern ! The Mets lose ! Their season is over ! Leela , the first woman ever to reach the majors will go down as the worst player in the history of blernsball . She 's taught the world that being a bum knows no gender . Tonight we 've seen the start of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well , Jackie Anderson ! - Leela ? - Jackie . I guess you were right I 'm a lousy role model . I 'm sorry . - No , don 't be . - You were an inspiration after all . - I was ? You were so awful that women set out to prove they don 't stink as bad as you . That 's so kind of you . I guess I made a difference after all . You absolutely did , Leela . Now please please retire . Immediately . Hey , kid ! Catch . You 're still the worst football player of all time . Yeah . Yeah .

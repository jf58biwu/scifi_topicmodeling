 - Anyone noticed ? - You are blessed with luck , Tomas . Gregory , life is for living . Your hair is still wet . - Who is our visitor ? - Father Michael . He has brought something for the repository . - Hurry up , say amen . - This cannot be good . - What ? - Whatever you are doing here . Trust me , Gregory , this is good . Where are you taking me ? The repository . Oh , and you expect to use my key ? Forget it . - Too late . - Oh , Tomas . We should not be here . That key was entrusted to me . Go back to the room if you like . I have always wanted to know what is kept here . - Some things are better left a mystery . - Look at all this . This monastery was built to protect the contents of this room . I want to know why . The Wheel of Time . What is it ? I 've heard stories of it but never believed it to be real . It is rumoured to be a means of transport through time . How ? - The lights are burning . - Brother Rafael was here . - He must have left them so . - indeed . Father , is something wrong ? We thought of burying it . Or throwing it in the sea . But evil ... has a way of returning . Written by St Nicodemus of Alexandria in 1260 . A scholar and warrior . Munkar and Nakir . Described as ravening lions to the soul and body of the world . Father Michael , I understand the gravity of this burden . I have devoted my life to being the guardian of these artefacts . Guardian of evil . I see now why the Order of Damascus is an offence to Rome . The Holy Father is aware of the importance of our work which is why he sent you and your charge to us . And I can promise you that everyone here is as serious as I am about keeping these secrets ... safe . Now can we please get out of here ? Tomas , did you hear nothing Father Michael said ? Whatever lies in that box is evil . The real evil is keeping such a beautiful work of art locked in a chest . Chest . - This sculptor was quite talented . - Put it back in the chest . Quickly ! You must put it back . Gregory , if you wanted to touch it , all you had to do was ask . - Oh . Oh . - Gregory , what are you doing ? Oh ! - What is that ? - Get it off me ! Get it off ! Get it off ! - Get it off ! - Get off of him ! Get off of him ! Tomas , help ! Ah ! Ah . May the Lord have mercy on us all . - Tomas , go back to the monastery . - What were they ? Demons , succubi . Foul things from before the time of man . And now they are free . Unleashed . Moving through time toward a world that is ill-prepared for their evil . Gregory ... He will die if you do not get help . Hurry ! Time is short ! - Father . - Time is short . Come , sister . There is much to do . Let us see what this new age has to offer . Why don 't we just take a trip ... Yeah . Should be pretty good ... Whoa ! What ? Woo ! Have you thought about what you leave ? About Gregory ? - He has the Order , he has you . - He needs his brother . His real brother . What happened last night was proof of something I 've known for some time . This place is not right for me . I 've watched you two since you were children . Gregory has always followed our ways , always been ready to do the Lord 's work . And I have always been trouble . Yes , I suppose that is true . But you have a strength , Tomas . It runs deeper than you know . You still have a part to play in God 's plan . I am more concerned with my own plans right now . I understand . You know there will always be a place here for you if and when you decide to return . Thank you , Father . Your hand . What happened to it ? - lt is a blister . - Let me see it . It is nothing . Let me see your hand . You have been marked . - lt is a burn , nothing more . - That is not true , Brother Tomas . God has chosen you to wield the dagger of St Nicodemus . But I have never fought in my life . You must travel on the Wheel of Time , find Munkar and Nakir . Find them and destroy them . Father Michael , I will travel south to the ocean and the sun . No Munkar , no Nakir , no Wheel of Time . Tomas , God has chosen you . Then He has chosen wrong . Tomas ! - Tomas . - Rafael , what is it ? Your brother Gregory - he 's dying . Oramus te , Domine , per merita Sanctorum tuorum quorum reliquiae hic sunt et omnium Sanctorum , ut indulgere digneris omnia peccata mea . Amen . This dagger was forged by St Nicodemus to battle the demons . He believed that Munkar and Nakir had destroyed entire cities . This dagger is the only thing that can stop them . It has tasted of their blood and will lead you to them . The world as we know it will be changed , Tomas . It will be filled with many new strange things . But remember , God 's children do not change . They will help you on your journey . When you find the demons , strike quickly . You may not get a second chance . God be with you , my son . And also with you , Father . Thank you , my brother . Oh , damn ! My bad , bro , I wasn 't watching . You all right ? l-l do not know . Yeah , you don 't look so hot . You sick ? Do you know where you are ? What day it is ? Your name ? What 's your name , man ? - My name is Tomas . - Tomas . OK . Look , we should get you to a hospital . No , I 'm fine . My stomach . Stomach , yeah . Can I do anything for you ? Give you a lift somewhere ? - A lift ? - A ride home ? Something ? A ride , yes , please . You got it . Which way you heading ? Hey , where you going , man ? That way . Ah ! Oh . 'This bracelet is beautiful , you can 't get better than this . 'ln fact , as always , your satisfaction is guaranteed ! 'There 's nothing else to say . ' Satisfaction guaranteed . ' .. sold seven in the last 20 seconds ... ' Turn off that noise box . It 's ruining my appetite . Munkar , the noise box and its pictures will teach us how to behave in this new time . 'There is no risk to you . ' 'That 's right ! ' No risk ... to you . 'Your satisfaction is guaranteed . 'Satisfaction guaranteed . ' Satisfaction guaranteed . 'There is no risk to you . ' 'That 's right . ' Absolutely no risk to you . - This all right ? - The world has truly changed . is this the part of town you want to go ? There are better places to stay . I have a task to complete and then I 'll be going home . So where 's home ? A long journey away . Oh , dear Lord ! Drop the weapon ! Drop it ! - Hey . - Hey , you . - You OK ? - Yeah . Found this . It 's funny the stuff you find when you 're not expecting it . Dad gave it to me the day I graduated from the academy . - He was a good man . - Yeah , he was . - He 'd be proud of you , Rach . - l hope that 's true . Trust me , he would be . I miss him . Me too . That 's why I like to spend time with you . You 're a lot like him . - lt goes both ways . - You take it one day at a time . Wake up in the morning , breathe in and out , do your job . Yeah. lt 's just the cross . It caught me off guard , is all . - You ready for breakfast ? - Yeah . What 's on the menu ? Homicide , Gastown . - Oh , God ! There 's something you don 't see every day . The victim is Greg Summers . White male , aged 38 . Found a wallet , some pictures . Probably married . Came up here for a little fun . - Who found him ? - Housekeeper . She 's downstairs , in shock . Had the front desk call us . Do something about the smell ? How long 's he been here ? A month ? - ME says not even an hour . - What ? Victim was seen coming up here with two hookers . - Where are they ? - Trying to find them right now . We do have another suspect . - Tomas Alcala ? - Yes . I 'm Detective Dressler . This is Detective Rand . I give my solemn word , I did not harm that man . - Your solemn word ? - Yes . Mr Alcala , I understand that you 've waived your right to an attorney ? - Yes . - You know everything you say and do may be used against you in a court of law ? Everything I say and do will be judged by God . Fine . Then maybe you can tell us what you were doing in that hotel room . I was looking for two women . Two hookers ? - Hookers ? - Prostitutes . Two prostitutes were seen going in ... No , they are succubi . In English , please . A succubus is a demon that feeds on the life force of men . Why were you looking for them ? They are ravening lions to the soul and body of the world . These ravening lions , why didn 't you stop the ravening lions ? I arrived too late . They had fed on the man and escaped . Do you know where they went ? You . Yes , it is you . I saw you find it . - What ? - The cross . The golden cross your father gave you . You found it . Don 't change the subject , Alcala . You miss him deeply . When you found the cross it made you cry . I saw you cry . - You take over . - Rach . Rach . OK , granted , that was pretty weird , given the fact you found it today but it 's a coincidence . You can 't let the loonies know they 're getting to you . - Who is he ? - A nobody , a drifter . - All we know is he 's a suspect . - Did we run prints on him ? Prints gave us nada , no id , no social security number . As far as the world 's concerned , he doesn 't exist . What 's taking her ? She will be out soon . She bathes for you . All right . But I did pay for the two of you so two is what I expect . Know what I 'm saying ? Your satisfaction ... is guaranteed . I like the sound of that . So what 's the deal with you guys ? Are you a lesbian couple or what ? I like that. I like it . So who 's the top ? You or her ? She is . So if you 're innocent , tell me what you were doing with this . I was using it to find Munkar and Nakir . I 'm assuming those are the prostitutes . Succubi . How 's this knife supposed to help you find them ? The blade is drawn to them and ... lt will point in their direction . - Spin it . - Spin it ? There . That direction . That is where you will find them . All right , that was a pretty good trick . - Ow . What the ... ? Get it off me ! Give me your hand ! Get it off me ! Hold still ! - Sick son of a bitch ! - Let him go ! - lf you hurt her , I 'll ... - lt wasn 't him . - What happened ? - l don 't know . This thing bit me . - A maggot. I don 't know what it was . - Where ? There . He stepped on it . Let me see your hand , Rachel . I don 't understand . It was , it was right there . It was right there . Be careful , Munkar . Do not drink so deeply . I have fed from more men than you can imagine , sister . I know when the heart blood comes . What is that ? I do not know . The priest . He has the dagger ! Not a priest , nor a saint . Just a monk , a monk who 's very far from home . Mm . Familiar . I drank of your brother , did I not ? I will stop you ! I will stop you ! How will you do that , little one ? That dagger must be wielded by a saint in order to be of any harm to us . You are no saint . I can smell sin on you . I don 't think he did it . Look at all the evidence . The guy escapes , two hours later we get a burglar alarm . What do we find ? A new victim . And he leaves his calling card . He says the knife led him to this Munkar and Nakir . - Maybe he caught them in the act . - That 's crazy talk , OK ? You need a break , a leave of absence . Whatever you wanna call it , take it . I don 't need a break , I 'm fine . We should go after the women , not Alcala . Wanna tell me about that imaginary bite on your wrist ? I know what I saw . I don 't wanna talk about this any more . Morgan , the knife 's clean , there 's no trace of blood from any of the victims . It 's not the murder weapon , he 's just taunting us with it . - Why do you want to crucify him ? - l don 't have time for stories about dog-sized maggots and demonic hookers . You have rested long enough , Nakir . Leave me . I am weary . You fed , you ... cannot be ... Filthy , repulsive slut ! Wrapping your legs around every slab of human flesh you bring home . I warned you but you did not take heed . I know why you are weary - because you are with child . Do not presume to judge me . Without my efforts we would never feed . Hold your tongue , sister , or I will hold it for you . Be still . Little one , be still , be still . Understand you are my sister . I am trying to protect you . You lie . - l can smell the stink of your jealousy . - No . I speak the truth . Nakir , our brood are born ravenous . They will kill and consume us if not given other food . This world is filled with bags of food , all walking around , making noise . Your youth is your folly . And it will be your undoing . It was you who allowed Nicodemus to imprison us . We are both guilty of indiscretions . - Now I hunger . - Come . Let us find you some sustenance . Why go further than the nest ? We can feed on the priest . Not yet . The monk is special . He is meant to be savoured . We will save him for later . I do not know why You chose me . I 'm failing You , Lord. I 'm failing You . Our Father , who art in Heaven , hallowed be Thy name . - Excuse me . - Yes , ma 'am , how can I help you ? Get that man off the boardwalk . It 's supposed to be a family place . Don 't worry , I 'll get right on it . Give us this day our daily bread . Forgive us our trespasses ... All right , pal . What the ... ? What are you covered in ? I want to control the wheel . - Oh , you wanna drive , huh ? - Yes . Tell you what - why don 't you slide on over here and sit on my lap ? We 'll take it for a simulated test drive . Huh . Yeah . Oh yeah . Now , that 's more like it , huh ? Your friend 's kinda quiet back there . - She likes to watch . Well . Put your hands up on the wheel and put one foot on the gas . I 'll be your seat belt . Here we go . Why must you always spoil my enjoyment of the food ? - He was growing tiresome . - That 's what made him enjoyable . Mm . Mm . - What have you got ? - A station wagon . Witnesses saw two women get out and head into the store . - Sound like your suspects ? - Sure does . Wait , we 're not set up to cover you yet . - Rachel ! It isn 't polite to interrupt people while they are eating . - Put her down ... Ugh . Ah . Hello , lover . Hateful wench , you dare threaten me ? Get her away from him . Aah ! Nakir ! Release it . If you so much as spill one drop of Munkar 's blood ... I will kill him . Let him go . Not yet . Not while his life still has worth . You take one more step with that dagger and my sister will rip him from groin to guts . Go , go , go ! Where are they ? Morgan ! Morgan ! Morgan . You OK ? Just got the wind knocked out of me . You saw me shoot that woman . - l don 't know what I saw , it was crazy . - l 'm telling you , they 're not human . Maybe they 're hopped up on PCP . That might explain it . But they 're our primary suspects , - not Alcala . - They 're all suspects . Guys , another unit brought in that guy , the one who skipped on us . - Tomas Alcala ? - That 's him . Couple of officers picked him up at Playland. ls he still a suspect ? No . Yes . He 's asking to speak to Detective Dressler . Rachel . He 's still a suspect . - Detective Dressler . - Get it off me ! Are you all right ? Can you stop them ? - l pray to God ... - Screw that . Can you stop them ? - l need the dagger . - That 's not a problem . Then you must set me free . Let him out . We thought he was a suspect . No , he 's not a suspect any more . Put your hands behind your back like you 're handcuffed . - Like this ? - Yeah . Just keep them like that . Get in here . There 's a call here for you . Come on . I 'm sticking my neck out for you . - Don 't let me down . - l 'll do my best , I promise . That Dressler woman may cause us problems - she has found the dagger . She is no more saint than our little priest . Remember Nicodemus ? In the wrong hands that dagger could seal our fate . My appetite has been aroused by that police . Pity I could not feast on him . In time , we will feed on the monk , regain our strength , then we will find this Dressler woman . - Where is he ? - Detective Dressler took him out . - What ? - l 'm sorry . She said you knew . You better have a damn good reason . - l need you to trust me on this . - Are you nuts ? He 's a suspect . - l 'll have him back in the morning . - You 'll have him back in ten minutes . I know what I 'm doing . You 're gonna have to trust me . This is not about trust , Rachel . Morgan . - What do you want ? - l want you to keep my back just until I can get some answers . OK . But I want him in that cell tomorrow morning . Don 't make me come looking for you . Find him . We must find him ! - ls this where you live ? - Temporarily . OK , I found these . They might be a little big on you but at least they 're clean and not covered with ... - Demon secretion . - Yeah . Like I said , they 're clean . That is where you were when you found the cross . OK . So how do you know that ? The Wheel of Time showed me . It showed me all of this . - Come again ? - The Wheel of Time . It is how I came to be here . I have been sent from the year 1815 to stop Munkar and Nakir . Uh-huh . I realise that is difficult to believe . If you 'd said that yesterday I would 've thought you were nuts . Now I 'm not so sure . Does that mean you believe me ? I don 't know what I believe any more . Giant maggots , magic knives , bulletproof hookers . So does that mean you believe me ? I don 't know why but ... yeah , I do . The Dressler woman - once we find her we 'll find the monk . How do we find her ? She is a police , like him . Afternoon , ladies . What can I do for you ? My sister would like to take a ride in that machine but she is afraid . Will you take a ride with us ? I can 't , really . I 'm on duty . Do you think you could make an exception ? The police has touched the priest . I can taste it on him . Where is the monk , police ? I don 't know any monk . The man you touched , the one who was covered in our secretion . Yeah . The vagrant guy . Yeah . The mother complained . I took him ... to the station ... Fifth Precinct . You are ... you 're sweet . Mm . Sweet ! Thank you . Welcome to the Fifth Precinct , ladies . How may I help you ? This is a miracle . An entire library in a small box . Can you find information on St Nicodemus ? - Who 's that ? - The saint who forged the dagger . - He originally imprisoned the demons . - Let 's see . This is such an age of wonders . So why did you leave ? Volunteer or were you recruited ? I made a very bad mistake . One that can never be taken back . I set them free . Munkar and Nakir . I am responsible for the blood they shed . By the way , you were right . What you said about my father . And I do miss him . Very much . He gave me this a month before he died . I was a rookie , I got lazy and did a bad search and I let the suspect go . He thought it would be funny to rob the house of the cop who arrested him . My dad was here . I guess they were both surprised to see each other . My dad was shot four times . You could not have known . Four times . Where do you get absolution for that ? From God . Thanks , I don 't believe in Him . Your cross ? I don 't wear it. I just keep it because it reminds me of my father . Looks like St Nicodemus wrote a book . Nothing about the dagger though . Father Michael said only the dagger could stop them . However , when the demons saw me they laughed . The dagger must be wielded by a saint to be effective , and I am not a saint . - So what do we do now ? - We must find a saint . - Tell us where she is . - We will not harm her . We only want the dagger , and the man she has in her care . No risk to you . - What man ? - The little monk . We know she took him from this place and you know where she is . You 're gonna have to kill me . Oh . - We will . But only after you 've told us where Dressler is . - What 's the name of your order again ? - The Order of Damascus . - There it is . - Your monastery is now a hospice run by a Sister Stephen . Who is that ? Sister Stephen , Patricia Stephen . Looks like a Mother Teresa type . Cares for people with long-term illnesses . Newspapers are calling her a saint . I knew we would find a saint . She can wield the dagger . This is all part of God 's plan . - Where are you going ? - To the monastery . I 'm sure she 's gone for the night . Wait till morning . I saw you looking at me . I am sorry . No , it 's OK . I liked it . We 're both so alone . Please , I cannot . Oh . Come now , little priest , do not pretend that you 're not enjoying my touch . - You repulse me . - One would not know that from your actions . You seemed to be quite accepting of Nakir 's affections a moment ago . Please , I cannot . - Oh , God . - Please , no . - You 're almost there , Tomas . Soon you will know the warmth of our embrace . Almost there , Tomas . You 're almost there . Lord , take this burden away from me ! Ah ! Alcala ? You awake ? Morning . What are you doing over here ? I tried sleeping in the place you set for me but I am more accustomed to this . - l 'm sorry if I frightened you . - No , it 's fine . Sleep where you want . Did you hear anything in here ? I 'm sorry , Rachel . They made me lead them here . Neither of you learn very quickly , do you ? Stop . Stop it ! You 're killing him . Yes. lsn 't it exquisite ? Sister . Do not drink so deeply . Do it . Please . No ! Munkar ! Munkar . Come on . Come on . How do I save you ? Tell me what to do . At times like this our faith is tested . - Spare me the sermon . - God 's will works through us . God 's will ? You think it was His will that I shot my partner ? What kind of God is that ? It is not for us to know His purpose . But know that He has a will , take comfort in that . I can 't. lt doesn 't bring Morgan back . He has gone on to a better place . Am I supposed to take solace in that ? Everyone that I 've ever cared about has been taken from me . It doesn 't matter if he 's in a better place because I 'm still here . Yes , because God has work for you to do . What if I 'm not interested in doing His work ? Then I will tell you I know how you feel . And the demons , they took my brother from me . I understand your pain and your loss . But you must understand this - if we fail at this task their offspring will grow in number and destroy the earth . Now , we must get the dagger to Saint Patricia . Look , about back there and before , I was a little rough on you . I know you were only trying to help . Loss is painful . Yeah . Sorry , Alcala . Please , call me Tomas . Rachel . Rachel ? That is a beautiful name . - Go ! Drive ! Go ! - Hold on . Are you girls all right ? Tomas and Rachel ? Yes . You must be Sister Stephen . Oh , please , call me Patricia , or Patty . We don 't stand on ceremony , here . Thank you very much for seeing us . Pleased to meet you . Forgive me for being rude , but you do not wear a habit . A lot of people are frightened by it . By a nun 's clothing ? Why ? I blame the movies . Would you like to come up ? - Well , it 's quite a story . - Sister Stephen ... Patricia , I know how it sounds and if I hadn 't seen these things first-hand myself I wouldn 't believe it either . It 's not a question of believing you , it 's more a question of saintly credentials . Unfortunately I 'm not a saint . But you must be . - Sorry for the misunderstanding . - Wait . Sister , please , you are my last hope . I 'm sorry , Mr Alcala . I wish I could help . Mr Alcala , is something wrong ? This is where my brother died . I have failed him . I have failed them all . Look , sister - l have found sustenance for your newborn . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Aah ! Oh ! Ah ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh , Munkar , something is wrong . Help me . Aah ! Help me ! Help me ! No ! No ! Why do you protect her ? She was to be food for my child . I warned you about allowing the seed into your body . - Munkar , do not forsake me . - l have not forsaken you . Our existence is made up of phases . You have surpassed me and moved on to the next phase . I envy you . No ! Wait ! - Munkar ! Yes , sister , I envy you . But you are of no use to me any more . I need a partner who can lure prey . You , Nakir , are spent . Treacherous bitch ! Miserable , faithless whore ! Do not worry . You will do better , sister . There is absolutely no risk to you . You said the Order of Damascus sent you here with a dagger of some sort to use against the demons . May I see it ? Father Michael said I was the chosen one because the dagger marked me . It certainly seems that way . But I am not worthy , I cannot wield the dagger . - l don 't see why not . - Because I am not a saint . Mr Alcala , if saints knew what they were , they would not be saints . Be still , sister . You will need all your strength for the transformation . - Thank you again for listening . - Like I said , it 's quite a story . - You think I 'm crazy . - On the contrary . I wish I had as much faith as you . - God be with you . - And with you , Tomas . If you see Rachel , will you please tell her I 've gone to the repository ? I pray you find what you 're looking for . Do not fear , little sister . I will care for you . Ah ! I 'm not your sister . Soon you will not remember this phase of your evolution . The pain will only last a moment . Then it is like falling into a blissful sleep . When you wake , we will go find your little monk and you can feast on him . You will not need to find me . I will not hide from you . You 're getting better with that dagger , little monk . But you still are not a saint and I do not fear you . Why don 't you just surrender yourself to me ? I will give you pleasures you never even dared dream of . You killed my brother . The only pleasure you can give me is your death . Poor little misguided man . I will savour your death . Filthy brood . - Come on . - No . We 're getting out of here . - The Lord has given me a task . - Let them kill each other . - Life is for living ! - l used to feel that way but the Lord gave me this life and now I give it back to Him . Tomas , you 're not a saint . If saints knew what they were , they would not be saints . - Where is Munkar ? - l don 't know . Please help me . The blade is stuck . I thought you weren 't a saint . I am not . Guess that 's not your decision to make . Perhaps it was you . So what are you going to do ? Bury it ? No . That has been tried . Evil has a way of returning . I must get it back to the Order of Damascus . How do you plan on getting back to them ? - l do not know . - Come on . Let 's get you out of here . Sister Stephen ! We need to get him to a hospital . I can do better than that . Follow me . The Wheel of Time . Many years ago the church sent a cardinal to take all of the artefacts . I hid this one . At the time I couldn 't have told you why . Just had a feeling it still had a part to play in God 's plan . God be with you , Tomas . I have to go . I want you to stay . I have to get these back . They must be kept safe . Tomas , please . Munkar has poisoned me . Can they help you there ? - They can pray for me . - So can I . Wear it . Oh , my son . Oh , my dear boy . Father , have I redeemed myself ? A hundred times over , Tomas . I could not hear you , my son . What do you say ? - Thank you , sister . - Tomas has gone home , hasn 't he ? - Yes . - That 's all the thanks I need . You know , you 're welcome to stay if you like . Appreciate the offer but I don 't think I 'd really fit in around here . You 'd fit in better than you think . I like the cross . - Yeah ? My father gave it to me . - lt suits you . English SDH PAL

We went to a world where there was 20 years of war . There was inflation and millions of refugees . Other countries tried to ignore it as if it was already over . But even under those hellish conditions their smiles were always those of pride The open smiles of the children So what ? What the hell 's that got to do with us ? What are you fighting for now ? Listen , kill me and the game 's over But would your struggle end ? Can you forget all this and resume your old lives ? Then what are you fighting for ? They all died because of you ! We 'll keep on fighting even if we have to fight every last adult in the world We 'll keep on fighting , even if we have to fight every last adult in the world Until the day that we can smile the open smile of the children we once saw Shuya , Special Forces , approaching our perimeter Here we go Back to our hideout All of us here either survived a game or lost family We 're not your enemies We 're going You , too Wait , Jin Hey !

We never had anywhere we could go I knew that all along Or any place to go home to ! This is war , right ? You 're all fighting for your lives But die , and you 're just one more candle Even those poor little kids You 're all the same . You 're no better than the adults How I wish this war would end I keep on asking myself How can I answer all those who have died I don 't know But inevitably , we all grow up to be adults The best we survivors can do , is to keep remembering the ones who died Always and forever , even after we grow up Hello ? Hello ... Hello What are you doing ? I told you to knock You stink . Don 't come in here Listen , today 's your birthday , right ? Thought you and Mum and I could go out You 're the worst What ?

And then , finally the rain let up How much blood has been shed ? How many tears spilled ? All of our friends who fought beside us are dead , killed in the last 3 years But even as justice can never be vanquished we terrorists will never vanish , however evil they deem us Because we know That a handful of adults , a handful of nations selfishly define the nature of peace and freedom in this world But our world is so much more complex than that This world has 6 billion people living their own lives in 6 billion different ways , 6 billion kinds of peace , 6 billion kinds of freedom 6 billion kinds of war and evil No one has achieved peace without fighting for it Behind every peace , there 's a river of blood , sweat and tears It 's going live to global host computers worldwide But if we avert our eyes from that history and abandon it , then peace might as well be dog shit Dog shit , huh ? Japan , China , North Korea , Guatemala , Indonesia , Cuba , Congo , Peru , Laos , Vietnam , Cambodia , Grenada , Libya , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Panama , Iraq , Somalia , Bosnia , Sudan , Yugoslavia , Afghanistan .

 Three Hundred Big Boys MAN : This Week in the Universe . Dateline , Tarantulon 6 . The brave warriors of Earth under the command of Gen. Maj. Webelo Zapp Brannigan have achieved victory over the spider homeworld . And to the victor belong the spoils . One trillion dollars in silken treasure . [ MOANS ] My fellow Earthicans , after meeting with top voodoo economists I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you , the taxpayers . That 's right , I 've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill . Knock yourselves out ! [ CHEERING ] I 'm slightly richer ! BENDER : What to do , what to do ? One $ 300 hooker-bot or 300 $ 1 hooker-bots ? I 'm gonna swim with a whale . - They 're the gentle giants of the deep . - I 'm well aware of that . Scruffy 's gonna get himself one of them $ 300 haircuts . This one 's lost its pizzazz . A fortune , it is . At last , Zoidberg will live like a rich man ! Hey , cut it out . Go away . Get away from me . It 's just 300 bucks . What is that , like 1 00 cups of coffee ? That 's it ! I 'm getting 1 00 cups of coffee , starting now . Coffee machine , one cup of coffee , please . Smells good . - Leela , are you there ? - No . Oh , yes , you are . I 'm hereby inviting you and your oddball coworkers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus . I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it . Show them my medal , Kif . He rented it with his tax refund . So , Leela , will you have the pleasure ? What little there is to be had . Tomorrow night at 8 , then . Smooches . No cheap crack houses for me no more ! Very good , sir . Shall I pre-warm sir 's crack pipe ? [ MOANS ] [ KIF GASPING ] Oh , Kif , it was so romantic of you ... ... to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate . We 're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze . Yes . Seeds . Wafting . I almost feel kind of shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo . Hey , Gordon Gekko . I cost as much as this whole crummy date ! Shut up ! Ow ! Ma 'am , it has become too much of a chore for me ... ... to clean out my wrinkles each day . Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process ? Well , yes . In the same way an infant may fight Muhammad Ali , but- - One pound of stem cells , please ! Of course , any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary . [ SCREAMING ] BENDER : Ooh ! Oh ! Say , buddy , why is this Grand Cigar so pricey ? Well , as you can see ... ... its wrapper is a piece of the original U.S. Constitution . It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years ... ... and was buried with George Burns until grave-robbing space mushrooms- - Well , you know the rest . - Give you 300 bucks for it . - No can do . Oh , all right . I 'll just take these $ 300 burglar 's tools , then . Very good , sir . So , what time you close tonight ? Hey , Pops ! Did that tax rebate come ? Came and went . You 're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots ! With a warning label this big , you know they gotta be fun . But , Pops , I don 't want to have fun . I want to be like you , boring but prudently invested . Babylon 's bells ! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product ! - Now you put them on and have fun . - I don 't wanna ! Well , then , I 'm gonna put them on and make you watch me have fun ! See ? Fun , fun- - [ HERMES SCREAMING ] - Dwight ! Help me ! - I 'll save you , Pops ! [ SCREAMING ] [ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS ] Hey ! Turn that damn music- - Up . - Isn 't this fun ? DWIGHT : No ! I wish I had two mommies ! Try these on , sir . I ask for rich-guy stuff , and you give me shiny pebbles ? I bid you adieu . Ah ! [ MIMICS THE THREE STOOGES ] I 'd like a pass to swim with Mushu , please . Well , you asked the right guy . I 'm the whale biologist . Though , personally , I hate whales . Especially Mushu . Then why 'd you become a whale biologist ? I don 't know you well enough to get into that . $ 300 , please . Noon tomorrow . If you 're late , you tread water in the scallop tank . Yeah . I 'll have a coffee . - Guppy , trout , mermaid or- - ? - Whale , please . [ KIF GASPING ] Amy , I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you . Oh , Kify ! KIF : It shows the time wherever we both are , and it 's powered by love . Also , you have to wind it . - Oh ! Somebody won big at Skee-Ball ! - You shut up ! I love it , Kif . I 'll use it whenever I want to know what time it is . It 's Fry and Leela . Hi , Fry and Leela ! Keep peddling ! Oh , for the love of God , keep peddling ! [ SCREAMS ] [ CROWD SCREAMING ] Bye , Fry and Leela ! [ BABBLING ] Oh . Oh ! I can 't wait till the tattoos on Amy 's butt hear about this ! MALE TATTOO : About what ? FEMALE TATTOO : Tell us ! [ HORSE NEIGHS ] [ KIF SOBBING ] Don 't feel sad , my little tadpole . I 'm trying not to ... ... but my gift to you is in the belly of a whale . Say , this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you . - Hey , it is kind of like that . - To induce vomiting . That was the solution . Everywhere it went . [ CHUCKLING ] What a Valentine 's Day that was . Hmm . This may seem like a huge coincidence ... ... but I happen to have an in with that whale . Scruffy 's formulated a plan ... ... but you 'll need a ready source of nauseating rotten fish . - Freshen your coffee , sir ? - Yeah . Keep it coming . Put the pot down . Get away ! You 're so young in spirit . It 's hard to believe you 're as old as 25 . The key is to grab life by the ho-joes . Live every day like it might be your last . - What 'll it be , kids ? - One bowl of mild farina . Pay dirt . [ LEELA YELLS ] [ FREEZER MOTOR STOPS ] [ WHISTLING ] Here you go , big spender . Foie gras and caviar . Goose liver ? Fish eggs ? Where 's the goose ? Where 's the fish ? Hey , that 's what rich people eat . The garbage parts of the food . I ate garbage yesterday , and it didn 't cost me $ 300 ! I 'm not paying . Farewell , good sir . [ MIMICS THE THREE STOOGES ] [ GRUNTS ] The Grand Cigar , she is mine . And with absolutely no consequences . [ CHUCKLING ] [ MONSTER GROWL ] - You see that ? - Grand-theft tobacco . Time to get off our fat cop asses and ride . [ HERMES SNORING ] Hey , you . This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambalaya . So far so good . Where 's Kif ? [ GROANING ] This isn 't Yemeni ! It 's Sulawesi ! The cup 's shaking ! I don 't want my coffee shaking ! You seem a tad wound up , buddy . And your face is greasy . Real greasy . - Been up all night ? - Of course I 've been up all night ! It was insomnia . I couldn 't stop thinking about coffee . I need a nap . Coffee time ! - Mighty fine smokable . - Fancy cigar . Why don 't you smoke it already ! Puff , puff ! Go , go , go ! No . You can 't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogy ... ... in just anyone 's face . I 'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan 's black-tie reception . You coming ? [ BABBLING ] And the fifth reason whales kill is for the sheer fun of it . - Anything else ? - You 're lumpy and you smell awful . Hey , I calls them like I sees them . I 'm a whale biologist . Okay , Mushu , it 's feeding time . [ MUSHU MUNCHING ] - Oh , crud . He ate my suit . BIOLOGIST : It was ugly ! Whale biologist . [ GRUNTING ] - Perhaps if you tightened your grip , sir . - Thank you , golf slave . Rich people wouldn 't waste their time on this nonsense . Plus , these eggs are gritty and tasteless . [ MOANING ] Ow ! Not so rough ! [ MUSIC PLAYS ] Ladies and gentlemen , presenting Mushu ! The educated whale who thinks he 's better than you ! Come on , Mushu ! Barf ! Barf like a freshman ! And now , ignorant whale lovers ... ... we 'll see who 's boss as I make Mushu jump through this hoop ! Jump , Mushu . [ GAGGING ] BIOLOGIST : Who wants a fish ? [ CHILD CRYING ] Mushu is sad ! It just keeps coming and coming . [ BENDER HUMMING ] Wait . That choke . It 's the watch . [ CHEERING ] I got it , Amy . I got it . - The plan went off without a- - - He 's got aquarium property ! Stop him ! Better do what he says . He 's a whale biologist . You 're under arrest , you squishy punk . Oh . [ GAGGING ] VAGRANT : Oh ! The Spidarians , though weak and womanlike on the battlefield ... ... are masters of the textile arts . Taste like king crab , by the way . Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest ... ... while I was still killing them . What ? It 's not even scratch and sniff . But if rich people think it 's good , I 'll buy it . One art , please ! What a clever impersonation of a stupid poor person . How much is that place mat actually worth , Brannigan ? - Exactly $ 1 billion . - Now , that 's walking-around money . NIXON : What ? Hey ! So I said to Kitty , " The only way to keep the butler from running away ... - ... is to cut off his foot . " - Ah . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Yes , it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle-class people . [ SOBBING ] I 've never been sad at a party before . I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail ? Jail 's not so bad . You can make sangria in the toilet . - Of course , it 's shank or be shanked . - Of course . Look , just give back our property , and we 'll drop the charges . Fine . Have the watch . It 's broken anyway . I don 't want your watch . You 're covered in precious ambergris . Precious hamburgers ? ROSEANNE : " Ambergris . " Noun . A greaselike product of the sperm whale 's digestive tract ... ... that is used as a base in the finest perfumes . This has been Roseanne , your guide to the world of facts . You heard Roseanne . Scrape off the priceless ambergris , and I 'll let you go . Or better yet , I 'll simply shed my skin . [ GRUNTING ] Stop it . Stop it . It 's fine . I will destroy you ! [ CLOCK CHIMES ] [ GASPING ] Gotta go . Fight club . PUNK GIRL : What 's happening , Hubie ? I 'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk ... ... I bought with my tax refund . Well , as long as we 're being honest ... ... I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment . That certainly is honest . It 's better for us to both just be ourselves . - You , wrinkled as a prune . - You , fat as the queen of sea cows . I love you ! FARNSWORTH : Oh , my ! So you see , the putrid , waxy substance ... - ... I was coated with was- - - Not precious ambergris ? Yes ! And I managed to sneak some out in the usual place . Using that , I 'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry . Oh , Kif , it 's so romantic , I can 't even wait ! I 'm gonna wear it right now . [ SPITTING ] [ GROANING ] - Who smells like freaking porpoise hork ? - I do ! Kiss me , Kif . Oh , what a foolish squid I 've been . I 'm not rich . I can 't even buy one measly masterpiece . Pardon us , gent . Might a couple of hungry , hungry hoboes ... ... take a feed from that aluminum snack box ? Ah . So now I 'm in the gutter , surrounded by bums who eat garbage ? Money brought me no happiness . Bupkis . This boot 's got a little pudding at the bottom . Interestingly , the Spidarians are more closely related to our elephants ... ... than our spiders . [ CHUCKLES AND GASPS ] [ SCREAMING ] Don 't mind us ! [ SCREAMING ] The loot . The loot ! The loot is on fire ! Leela , my precious rock dove ! I 'll save you ! - Everyone , to the fire door ! - It 's on fire ! We 're trapped , my sweet hippopotamus ! Coffee , coffee , coffee ! [ FRY 'S HEARTBEAT RACING ] DWIGHT : Where are we , Pops ? - What happened to the food ? I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur . Welcome , one and all ! I finally figured out how money could make me happy ... ... by using it to buy my hungry friends a feast ! VAGRANTS : Hooray ! Everyone join us . Oysters Rockefeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs . Heck , you 're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog . - Yeah ! BENDER : All right ! Turkey dog ! - I 'll take four . - Me too . Oh , what the hell . Here , Dwight . The boots only cost $ 299.99 . - You invest this penny like you wanted . - Thanks , Dad . A risk-taker . That 's my boy . The entire surplus is gone ! Oh , what a McGovern I 've been . Why did I have to issue that crooked tax rebate ? At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it . Oh , my , yes . Speaking of which , my story kind of petered out ... ... without me learning a lesson . [ CHUCKLING ] There he is . All right ! Closure ! [ GROANING ] BENDER : Stop that ! Ow ! " Futurama . " Noun . I don 't know . You just watched it , dummy . What are you asking me for ? Hey , here 's a fun definition . " Idiot . " Noun . You !

 Muryou was supposed to be absent , but for some reason , he was carried in by Tsumori . He 's never around when you need him ! " I came to protect you guys . " Yeah right ! Well ? How is Muryou doing ? He 's fine . He 's passed out . I see . I don 't think it 's funny ! Calm down . Don 't get angry . But it was terrible ! Harumi and Kyoichi were in danger ! They could have been killed ... But this idiot came trotting in after the fact , and then he just passes out ! He was fighting too . Yes . He was fighting to protect you and the other Chosen in outer space , far , far away ... In outer space ? Far away ?

This is what one of the Galactic Federation ships recorded , in the area where it happened . What is this ? I borrowed this from Ms. Isozaki . It 's pretty amazing . They recorded this from a considerable distance but it 's able to zoom in considerably close . It 's amazing . I 'm not sure I understand what you mean by " considerable " and " considerably " . Anyway , this is the spaceship that exploded , and ... Is that Muryou ? Yes . Where was this again ? The orbit of Pluto ... From Earth , the distance is approximately 44.6 astronomical units . Why is Muryou ... What is Muryou Subaru doing in a place like that ? The alien that Harumi fought seems to have teleported from this spaceship . The Shingu 's Astral Deviation is a major threat to them in their approach on Earth . That 's why they went after Kyoichi . Then , Muryou was ... He seems to have destroyed the spaceship before it could do any harm . He 's asleep so there 's no way to confirm that , but ... It was a pensive moment , and a grand story of epic proportions . By any chance , are you upset ? Are you upset that he helped you again ? Earlier you were complaining that he 's never around when you need him , but ... It bothers you when he actually does help . Am I right ? That 's not the reason ! Well , that 's part of it but ... We 're protected by everyone . By adults , Harumi , Muryou ... No matter how much I say I 'm going to end the old customs with my generation in the end , I 'm the one being protected by those old customs . When I thought about that , I started to feel pathetic , so ... Don 't worry about me ! It 's the same thing as always ! After getting depressed and hitting rock bottom , I 'll be happy as can be tomorrow . Murata ... thanks . Itjust slipped out . H ... Hey ! Wait up ! Morning . M ... Muryou ! Are you all right ? Huh ? Oh . I 'm doing great this morning after all that sleep . Huh ? Hey ! Come out ! What 's wrong ? Well , yesterday she ... It wasn 't me ! It wasn 't my fault right ? She heard what happened to you from Jirou , on her way home from school yesterday . What ? Muryou was unconscious ? Yeah . He was carried piggyback by the student government president ... I felt so bad for him ... Why ? What happened to him ? No , I 'd rather not say . What do you mean by that ? To be honest , the reason was ... Stop teasing and just tell me ! To be honest ... . To be honest ... The reason was your lunches ! No , um , Futaba ... It 's a lie right ? Did you faint because of my lunches ? Did you maybe , possibly , by chance faint because you got food poisoning or became malnourished , or did it build up your stress and whatever other factors ? Is that why you fainted ? Something terrible like that didn 't happen because of me , did it ? Did it ? Huh ? Well , umm ... Hey , you 're troubling Muryou . I knew it . I 'm only a troublesome woman to Muryou ... A woman ? Listen to yourself ... That wasn 't why , Futaba . Of course it wasn 't ! It couldn 't have been my fault ! I 'm so relieved , so ... . Damn ... Sorry Muryou ... It 's okay ... How did it end up like this ? It 's Jirou 's fault . My fault ? It 's because you made fun of her lunch . She got even more worked up about it , and see what happened ? But your lunch is ... Rice Seasoning Egg Rice Seasoning Egg That 's rough . I think she was burnt out by the time she was done with Muryou 's lunch . Sorry ! I meant it as a lighthearted joke ! Muryou ! Hi , long time no see . What an ordeal you went through , Muryou . Well , yeah ... I heard you 're trying to earn a living for both you and your sick grandfather . You took off from school to go to work and fainted at your part-time job ! How gallant ! It 's gallant ! Who told you that ? From Shun Morihata ! Come on everyone ! Let 's give our gifts to Muryou ! Yeah ! Wow ! The entire school is talking about Muryou . It 's amazing . Rumors of all sorts are flying about ... Is it because of you ? Well , I meant it as a lighthearted joke . So ... What actually happened ? About Futaba ? No . No . About Muryou . Remember how this morning Jirou , who usually loves being nosy took the " I totally don 't care " stance ? Wasn 't it surprising ? Oh ... It makes no difference . I 'm sure Subaru has his reasons . The way Jirou acted and Morihata 's lies seem like they 're trying to patch together a story ... Like a cover-up ... A cover-up ? A cover-up to conceal what happened yesterday . You transferred here like I did , so you must have noticed it too . Doesn 't it seem like everyone patches together their stories sometimes ? Well that 's ... Jirou 's like that . Morihata and the guys from the student government are like that too . Even Yama-chu is like that . Their ancestors have been living in this town for generations . Maybe this town has another rule that we don 't know about . You wouldn 't , per chance know something about that , would you ? I 'm joking . My own curiosity aside , it 's still interesting . The Festival Club ... Ha-chan ... Muryou ... Later . I 'll have the proposal for the Cultural Festival ready by homeroom . A sudden shocking comment . Toshio 's suspicion is reasonable . Even I was thinking along the same lines when I 'd first moved to this town but I 've gotten used to it . That 's because this town is a good town . But I wonder how Toshio would react if he was told the " other rule " was an agreement made with the Galactic Federation ? Ramen Umaka Soba What 's he going to do with this stuff ? I dunno . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Over here . Over here . Sorry to keep you waiting ! Jirou was still asleep when we went to his house to get him . I said I 'm sorry ! But then you went back to bed ! Who cares ? We 're on time , aren 't we ? A week later , we were off to participate in the Koyurugi Festival . The children of the elementary school had invited the Festival Club . Koyurugi Festiv al Koyurugi Festiv al The other clubs invited were the Theater Club , the Music Club and the Choir Club .

It 's our life . I fell over cause I was looking up . I bumped my head ' cause I was looking down . That 's why . That 's why . From now on ... Umm ...

It 's such a nice feeling to perform on stage and not go to school on a weekday . Everyone 's in class right now at the middle school . Too bad for them . But we have a make up class on Sunday . No way ! That 's what Yama-chu said the other day . Did he say that ? I 'm exhausted . It 's finally over ... Good job . The Festival Club is on after the next presentation right ? You 're almost up . Umm ... Who are you ? Come on , it 's me ! Shun Morihata ! Huh ? You guys have never seen Shun act in a play ? N ... No . Morihata , who 's a member of the student government , is also a member of the Theater Club . For last year 's Cultural Festival , he played Martin Taylor from the " Flying Classroom " , and was apparently a big hit . Unfortunately , I didn 't get a chance to see it so I don 't know how well received it was ... But by the looks of him , I 'm sure it was very well received . Stop . You 're embarrassing me . W ... What the heck is wrong with you ? ! Hey everyone ! Over here ! Dreamy eyed ! Dreamy eyed ! Hey ! Listen everyone . Great moments aren 't always lying around ! Appreciate the moment !

Are you guys ready to go ? Well , yeah ... That 's what I call confidence ! It 's easy for us because we 're only announcing what we 've researched . We don 't have to act like Morihata did , so ... Normally people have problems doing that . You really are interesting ! Let 's take a picture ! Everyone get in ! Welcome Welcome Middle schoolers jumping into the elementary schoolers ' event . Middle schoolers jumping into the elementary schoolers ' event . I don 't know who 's idea it was , but I think it 's a great idea to see their upperclassmen up close and personal , doing theirjobs or making complete fools of themselves . To say they 're thinking about their future would be overstating it , but ... I think it 'll serve as a good example of what to expect when they become middle schoolers .

I want you to come with me . Next is the Misumaru Middle School Festival Club . Hello everyone . As we were just introduced , our club 's name is the Festival Club . If you 're wondering what kind of club we are , we 're a club that puts on a festival ... hence , the name . I moved to this town four years ago . They didn 't have a festival where I was living before . When I first saw a portable shrine , the only way to describe it was that it looked like a lot of fun . The fall season was almost over , but there was so much excitement in the air . Video 's okay . Portable shrine go ! Gotcha . Okay ! Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Muryou ! Muryou ! Muryou ! Muryou ! Muryou ! Futaba ... She 's going nuts all by herself . Muryou ! Washoi Washoi ... Washoi . Muryou ! A long time ago , this fall festival was celebrated all over Tenmo . When I saw it , it was being held in the shopping district . I 'm sure some of you think that it 's a shopping district event . Up until recently , that 's what I thought it was . Seisa Untoko Yoito Yoito ... Seisa Untoko Yoito Yoito ... Hachiyou ! Hachiyou ! The last time a large-scale festival was held was ten years ago . It was a very grand and beautiful festival . But according to my grandfather , it was still not as impressive as it used to be . Then how impressive was it back in the day ? Hachiyou ! He 's the famous local guy . The elementary schoolers even love him . Yup . Yup . Both of you get ready for the next part . Oh ! Yes , yes . Sis , I 'm counting on you to take care of it . Huh ? Did you say something ? I said I 'm counting on you . Sure ! Leave it to me ! We 're counting on you . Okay . It 's almost time . The origin of festivals dates back to the Yamato Era . Space is ... What is it ? Space is ... What is it ? ... vast . Space is ... Where is it ? ... vast . Space is ... Where is it ? ... far away . It 's okay . I 'm sure the Festival Club is doing just fine putting on their presentation . Shun ! You 're so impatient about this and that , whatever 's in front of you , but you 're so optimistic about the things that are important . That 's why I wanted you to think about that , so ... What 's that supposed to mean ? What happened ? I wonder what it was ? Maybe it was a seagull ? Oops , I kind of screwed up my landing . Now ! Now ! What 's going to happen ? And so ... " To be continued in the next episode ! " There 's still a little bit more . Oh ... Can we agree on that ? Yeah ! Yeah ! Just you wait Muryou ! This is for Mischu and also for you ! Mischu Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Mischu Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Mischu Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! What can you say when we totally forgot about them ? So ... This time , it 's the real " To be continued in the next episode ! " To be continued Next Episode I 'm Futaba ! I 'm Yukari ! I 'm Midori ! Wasn 't the Koyurugi Festival so much fun ? Muryou was so dreamy . That 's right ! Muryou is going to be doing judo next ! What ? But I thought he wasn 't in any sports clubs ? But a bunch of things came up and ...

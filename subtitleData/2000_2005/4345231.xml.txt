 We saw the Earth destroyed . And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . Richie ? Are you in here ? Richie , you little shithead , you better get your butt in here and get to bed ! Don 't look at that ! I told you never to come in my room ! - What was that on the computer ? - Just a game . - So what are you building ? - Get out of here ! Okay , but I 'm warning you ... if you 're not in bed , asleep , before Charlie gets here , you 're dead . - This is the best . - lt gets better . - What about your brother ? - He 's in bed . He sleeps like a bear in hibernation . Oh , shit . Richie , what are you doing ? You weren 't supposed to see it . See what ? You should have minded your own business . Who the hell is ringing the doorbell at this hour of the morning ? - What time is it , anyway ? - lt 's about 6 : 00 . Well , it 's either the sun coming up or hell freezing over . - Hi , Aunt Jenny . - Hi . Chuck . Well , I guess it 's hell , since you 're here , with luggage . - You have anything to do with this ? - Come on in , Aunt Jenny . Answer my question . You have anything to do with this ? I 'm just ... . I 'm here to help wrap things up . - lt ain 't Christmas . Wrap what things up ? - Paige 's things . - Paige 's things don 't need wrapped up . - Really ? So you 've written all the thank-you notes ? You 've done something with all her stuff ? Have you ordered a headstone yet ? My wife dies , and I got to write thank-you notes ? Yeah , I think we could use her help , Dad . You know the first word this woman said to me in 15 years , is right now ? - So what ? - So before that the only thing she 'd ever ... have to say to me is some passive-aggressive attack ... which would elucidate her perfections ... - and my lack thereof . - You know what ? Never fucking mind . No , no , no . Hold on . Dad , we could use some family right now , okay ? Because in case you haven 't noticed , ours keeps shrinking . - lt 's okay , Neil. I 'll call you . - No , no. lt 's not okay . You two need to let the water go under the goddamn bridge . Shit . Hey , Zack . How you doing , my friend ? Know what ? I 'm doing a little research on comas ... and there 's evidence that music can actually be heard by persons in a coma . So your mum told me you like the Budro Sisters , so ... . l believe country music to be America 's most unfortunate invention . But if you like it ... here goes . God , the chords alone could wake you up . Hey , Zack , you got a great mother , you know ? She 's really hurting right now , so she could use you waking up . All right ? All right , buddy . - Hey . - Hey . - What 's wrong ? - l just want you to know that I fought this . But it came from upstairs , so don 't kill the messenger . - What ? - Sarah , they 're bringing in a co-anchor . - What ? - Yeah . Oh , hell , no ! - Sarah-- - l am the only anchor here , Troy . Yes , and you 're one of the last of a dying breed , Sarah . No local newscasts have a solo anchor anymore . - lt 's no reflection on you . - Oh , the hell it ain 't . They just think that it 's time that we team you up with someone . But why ? So we can be like ... kissy-kissy , buddy-buddy , and do everything but report the news ? - Yeah . - Well , who is he ? - lt 's a she . - A she ? It 's Kayli Haynes . - From Austin ? - Yeah . She 's huge there . Why the hell would she wanna come here ? This is the next step on the network track . Houston , and New York or L.A. What , so I 'm just a rung on the ladder for her to step on ? No . You are the woman who got on the ladder first . - She has to follow you up . - That 's really smooth . Tell a girl her career is going on the downslide ... and make her feel good about it , all in the same sentence . Sarah , your career is not on the downslide . TJl . Not much time . Okay , this replaces the zoo story . B-roll footage . I want you to see the visuals that go along with the copy . - You 've got less than five minutes . - Five minutes . - Look , I 'll leave you to it . - Yeah , you 'd better . But you better be here after this broadcast , because this conversation is not over . After the broadcast , we have dinner reservations . And I refuse to discuss work over surf and turf . Surf and turf . " An 18-year-old woman was electrocuted last night ... " in the Houston suburb of Deer Park . " Her 10-year-old brother has been arrested and charged with murder ... " for allegedly pushing an electrical appliance into the hot tub ... " that was occupied by the woman and her boyfriend . " - Hello . - You 're late . A brilliant observation . Have you ordered anything tasty for me , darling ? How would I know what you want ? Oh , darling , I 'm hurt . You haven 't learnt my culinary tastes by now ? I don 't think they serve martinis here , my friend . I 'll stick to water . Same colour . Thank you . Where are Neil and Angela ? Angela 's doing adverse-wind training at Ellington . Neil 's doing a little research for me . Well , I never thought I 'd say this , but ... it 's good to have you back at the round table , Chuckie . Really ? Well , I can 't say it 's good to be back , Kurtrude . And just for the record , the only reason why I 'm back ... is I ain 't got fuck-all else to do . Which brings us to the reason for Sarah 's little powwow . Yeah . Okay , a story I was doing caught my attention . A 10-year-old boy named Richie Lewis was arrested for the murder of his big sister . - And ? - And here 's the thing , okay ? Last month , I did a story on a fire that burnt down a family home ... and killed everyone in it except for a 10-year-old girl named Kelly Jones . Well , that sucks , but what 's it got to do with us ? Because in the old timeline , Kelly Jones was the one arrested . Richie Lewis wasn 't . So somebody scrambled with the timeline . Yeah , but don 't you think it 's an awfully big coincidence ... that two 10-year-old kids killed family members in a month ... within a mile from one another ? Yeah , I think it 's a coincidence , but I don 't see ... what it 's got to do fuck-all with the Earth blowing up . I do . I 've been checking into a MUD that Sarah found out this kid Richie ... . - Did you tell them ? - Yeah , I did . Okay , this kid Richie was playing . MUD ? What 's that , a new word ? No , MUD . M-U-D , it 's a multi-user domain . It 's online . Richie was obsessed with it . You 'll never guess the name of the company that provides the server . - Bet I do . - Leviathan Systems . - Leviathan . - That enough evidence for you ? Yeah , I suppose it is . - Please , come in . - Thanks . Kelly will be so excited to talk to a real live TV star . I doubt that . Yet , isn 't it refreshing how she rolls up her sleeves ... and does the work all by herself ? And you are ? This is Dr Kurt Matheson . He 's going to be assisting me ... with my research on the effects of traumatic events on a child psyche . How 's Kelly doing ? Oh , well , Kelly is a very resilient child . She 's bounced back quickly . She seems to be doing well in her new school . She 's handling the whole tragedy much better than I am . The only thing that 's worrying me is that she 's had three seizures . - She never had one before the fire . - What did the doctor say ? The latest theory is that the seizures are psychosomatic ... because she 's repressing her emotions . - That 's not to say that it 's not possible . - Oh , Kelly . This is Sarah Forbes . Recognise her from TV ? - No . - Sure you do . - She reads the news . - l hate the news . That 's okay . I hated the news , too , when I was 10 . - lt 's pretty boring . - Yeah . Kelly , do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions ? No . Well , then , please come in . I bet you miss your parents a lot , too , huh ? Not really . Kelly , do you have any idea how that fire got started ? Aunt Adel doesn 't play hopscotch as good as my mom . She plays checkers much better though . I don 't think the fire question 's gonna get an answer . I miss my class at school , too , especially Josh and Trudy . This is Josh and Richie and Trudy . And that 's me . I can 't believe no one made the connection . Those two kids were in the same class . Because the time the second murder happened ... Kelly was in a different school . Nobody even bothered to check her old school . What are you doing ? I thought it would be easier on you if I did this for you . Don 't you think you should have asked me first ? I don 't see a reason to. I mean , why would you keep Paige 's clothing ? What do you intend to do with all of it ? I was thinking about giving them to the Goodwill . That 's what they did with Dad 's stuff . Actually , Mom sent me a couple of boxes of Dad 's stuff . - She did ? - Yeah . She didn 't tell me . I 'd love to see it. I mean , it might bring back some nice memories . Be my guest. I never opened them boxes . I gave this to Paige two years ago for her birthday . She loved cashmere . I loved her in it . I don 't really know if I want some stranger wearing this stuff . I 'm sorry. I guess I should have checked with you first . Yeah . You should have . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't we , you know , pick out the things that have ... special sentimental value to you ... and we 'll put them aside , and then we 'll pack the rest ? Everything in this house has sentimental value , Jenny . Everything . Mr Taggart , my name is Howard Longe . I 'm the principal of the school . Yes , how do you do ? This is my son , Neil . - Hi . - Hi . Pleased to meet you . You must be very proud . Proud ? Yeah , yeah . Well , especially when Dad comes to speak at career day at school . He 's just the greatest . Well , your advance man here , he- - The man 's name is Mendel . Dr Kurt Mendel . Yes , of course . Mr Mendel . He tells me that you 're considering a special NASA programme that 'd hook up ... our school with the astronauts in the lnternational Space Station . Yup , that 's the plan . Great opportunity for a school . - Hi . - Good morning . - Good morning , Mr Longe . - Good morning . Hiya , kids. I 'm Chuck . You all working real hard ? Yes . Well , you can see this is our computer lab . - Well , these are very fancy computers . - Well , it 's nice . You know , the best of everything . I didn 't think a public school would have funding for something like this . Well , most of them don 't ... but this lab was given to us by an anonymous benefactor . Anonymous ? You have no idea who donated this lab ? No. I 'm guessing it would 've been maybe a parent of one of the kids ... who was about to start school . But why anonymous ? Well , anonymous donations are a little more common than you might think . You see , a lot of people , they don 't want attention drawn to their wealth . You know , but we 're , you know , we 're very pleased about the lab . - The kids love it , parents love it . - So everything 's perfect . - l beg your pardon ? - l said , everything 's perfect . I mean , there 's no complaints whatsoever or nothing ? No . Well , there was one , you know , time , a mother pulled her kid out . Why ? Well , as I recall , it was something to do with ... a concern on a mother 's part about our Internet policy . She didn 't like our limited restrictions on access . So you 're doing an investigative story on the school computer lab ? - Yes . - l knew it . I knew something was up with that place . That 's why I pulled Joey out of it . So you did suspect that something was wrong ? Yeah , well , I let Joey sign up for the class ... but after two weeks , I started to notice the change . Hey , Joey . Did you notice anything unusual in the computer lab ? Joey , you 're being impolite . Pause the game . What ? I 'm sorry , Joey. I know you really wanna get back to your game . I was just wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions . - Okay . - Okay . So the two weeks that you were there ... did you notice anything strange in the computer lab at all ? Uh-uh . - Can I play my game now ? - Joey , I told you- - Yeah , yeah . No , it 's okay . - Hey , Joey , is that Gran Turismo ? - Yeah . - Stick it on the dirt track , I 'll race you . - Are you kidding ? I 'll kick your ass . Well , bring it on , little man . Let 's go . You said after a couple of weeks , you noticed some changes . What kind of changes ? He became more introverted . Quiet . He didn 't wanna play outside anymore . It was subtle . I think only a mother would notice . - You think I 'm paranoid ? - Oh no , no , not at all . 'Cause literally two days after he started that class , his whole personality changed . Something bad was affecting my boy in that computer lab . I believe you . I 'm a mother , too , and any time there 's a change in my little boy ... I can feel it , even if nobody else can . - You have a boy ? - Yeah . - How old is he ? - He 's five . - He must be beautiful with a mom like you . - Thank you . Yeah , he is . Oh , no ! Come on , how did you know about that shortcut ? I 'm gonna beat you by a whole lap . Hey , Joey , you ever play any MUDs ? I can 't race anymore. I got homework . - May I be excused ? - Sure . Hi , honey . Got a big corned-beef sandwich . Your favourite . Thought maybe the smell would wake you up . Where 'd that come from ? That sweet man . I told him you liked the Sisters . Sarah ! Glad you 're here . I was just giving your new partner a tour . - Kayli Haynes , Sarah- - - Forbes . - l have been a fan of yours for years . - Thank you . In fact , you 're one of the women I studied to improve my performance . - You 're definitely one of the best . - Now you 're just blowing smoke up my ass . - Absolutely . - l just wanted to make sure . Listen , I want us to be friends ... since we are gonna play friends on TV and all . I 'm sure we will be . - l think that went well . - Yeah , yeah . I really believe you gave the family false hope , Dr Mendel . I didn 't promise them anything . I merely told them I was studying the genetic link to mental illness . - Then why did they grant you full access ? - Why don 't you ask them ? Hello , Richie . My name is Dr Kurt Mendel . This is my associate , Neil . Hey , Richie , what are you playing there ? - Dragon Battle . - Dragon Battle . Legacy of Fire ? Mmm-hmm . - You play ? - Yeah , a little bit . Richie , can you tell us about your sister ? I 'm through level one and two already . I have plenty of time to play here . I bet . Hey , Richie , do you have an Ethernet web connection for that thing ? Doctor ! Okay . Okay . - ls he gonna be all right ? - He bit his tongue almost clean through . - Can I ask you something ? - Yeah . is there any significance to the child 's Game Boy being hooked up to the Internet ? No . Not that I know of . Why ? It 's just that the detective that was here this morning asked the same question . It seems like an odd question for both of you . And when you asked the question , well , that 's when Richie had his seizures . Really ? Did you happen to get the name of this detective ? I can do better than that . I have his card . - No , he 's fine . Really . - Good , good . Because it 's come to my attention that some of the kids at the computer lab ... at school have been having seizures . - Oh , my God . - So Joey isn 't having them ? - No . - Good . That 's good to hear . Do you think there 's a risk he 's gonna start having them ? Well , if he hasn 't started having them , then he probably won 't . And besides , he wasn 't exposed to the lab as long as some of the other kids were . - Right ? - Yeah . So you came all this way to check on my little boy 's health ? What , is this part of the story ? No , it 's not part of the story. lt 's just that ... my own little boy has been sick . So these things tend to hit me right in the gut . I 'm really sorry to hear that . But I hope he 'll be okay . Thank you . Oh ... so you 'll call me if he exhibits any symptoms at all ? I will . Thank you . He 's fine , really . - Do you like that one ? - Like ? I don 't think that 's the right sentiment . I don 't like any of this . Why don 't we just let the cemetery pick something that fits ? Fits ? Yeah , just let the cemetery pick something that fits ... with all the other stones around Paige 's stone . I mean , we don 't wanna pick something that 's , like ... a gigantic monolith that 's gonna overwhelm something little , modest next to it . Yeah , it 'd be disrespectful to her neighbours . Well , let 's just pick something fairly modest then . Okay , I 'll tell you what , sis . Why don 't you pick it ? You 're the one who always had the great aesthetic choice in the family . Have you given any thought to the inscription ? - Hell , no . - Well , I always thought that Dad 's was nice . - lt says- - - " Loving husband and father . Brave pilot . " I never thought you went to his grave . Now why would you assume that ? Well , I kind of just thought that , since you didn 't come to his funeral- - - Here we go . - Well , you should 've been there . What I should 've done is never let you in the door yesterday . All right . Come on , guys . Not here , please . I like that sentiment . " Loving wife and mother . " Great , that 'll work . Tell you what , you handle it . - Miss Haynes , I need to mike you . - Oh , okay . - Hey . - Hey . - Who does the lights around here ? - Me and Fred . Could you or Fred kick up that 10K backlight for me ? Give a little more highlight to my hair . And could you send that camera guy over , please ? Does this mean you 'll never speak to me again ? - l 'm thinking about it . - You know I was opposed to this , right ? - Yeah , I know you were . - Stand by. ln 30 . Cover me , I 'm going in . ... and I never wanna know that you went any closer than here . - Hey . - Sarah . I am so excited . Aren 't you ? - Not as excited as that sound guy . - l beg your pardon ? And five . Good evening , Houston . Tonight marks a very special occasion for KNBS ... as we welcome a new member to the Action Edition team . - My new co-anchor , Kayli Haynes . - Sarah , it 's great to be here . And I can 't think of a person with whom I 'd rather share a desk . Well , Kayli , I 'm just happy to have some of the workload taken off my chest . No doubt . Speaking of workload , shall we do the news ? Yes . An arrest was made today in the robbery shooting death of two elderly men ... in Memorial Park last week . - Hi . - Hey , how are you ? - Fine . - Wanna come out ? Did you know there 's such a thing as a grave-marker showroom ? I don 't think it really started to sink in until I was looking at those markers , Hol . I mean , a grave 's just a patch of grass till you stick a headstone on it , you know ? Something to ... lean flowers on ... and to visit . Sorry , I just really needed to talk to you . My dad 's not much of a listener . - Neil . - Well , what is it ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . I just don 't want this to go where it went last time you needed a shoulder . Do you think that 's why I came over here ? Damn it . Yeah . Yeah , I thought we had a date for a little B and E. Shit . Yeah , I didn 't realise how late it was . Yeah , I 'll be there in 10 minutes . That 's good ' cause I like to have company when I 'm breaking the law . Yeah . Holly , I gotta go . Can we talk about this later ? Fine . What are they doing here ? It 's the weekend . I don 't think my eggs are gonna mix too well with the burnt ... whatever the hell this is in this pan . Your eggs ? The eggs in this house are my eggs , Sister ... and that 's my spaghetti , which I like burnt . - Why the hell did you come here , anyway ? - l told you already . - To help you deal with Paige 's stuff . - You haven 't talked to me in 15 years . You come all the way down here to box up some sweaters . Okay , you wanna know why I came here ? It 's because of something that Neil said at the memorial service . He stood there , all 1 7 years of him ... and he said , " 15 years is too damn long to hold a grudge . " - l ain 't holding no grudge . - He was talking about me . Oh . - So he was right , and here I am . - So I 'm forgiven , just like that ? What makes you think you have something to be forgiven for ? Now don 't start that tap dance with me , Sister . It 's not a tap dance , Chuck . I would like to understand it though . I mean , I know that you and Dad didn 't exactly have a good relationship ... but it was his funeral for Christ 's sake . You know , Sis , I 'm dealing with one recent funeral . I ain 't got time to open up and dredge up another . - Should have been there for Mom and me . - You 're right , I should have . What ? I said you 're right . I should 've been there for Mom and you . Just another one of those irresponsible moves you like to remind me of . Then help me out with this , Chuck . Why ? That 's all I wanna understand . Why not go to his funeral ? Because I didn 't like him ! And he didn 't like me ! So I didn 't think he wanted me at his party . - That 's ridiculous . - Yeah , I know it 's ridiculous . Well , let 's just suffice it to say that someone or something recently ... has brought me to a little enlightenment about Dad . - What enlightenment ? - That , my little sister , is my business . Fine . Okay , then . Why didn 't you explain this to me a long time ago ? A long time ago ? What , you got soap in your ears ? I just said it happened recently . Okay , then why didn 't you call me recently ? I did call you recently and left you a message recently ... and you didn 't call me back . As a matter of fact , recently you were in this very goddamn house ... at a memorial service and you did not recently say shit to me . Fuck ! - l 'm an asshole . - Come again ? I said I 'm an asshole ! Well , you said it , I didn 't . I got to be someplace . Why don 't we just go into that lab and pull the plug ? Because there 's no telling what could happen to these kids ' brains ... if we interrupt whatever 's going on in that lab . Yeah , we don 't know what 'll happen if we don 't . None of the kids who are still in class are having seizures . Are you sure about that ? No , but we do know that the ones who have been pulled out ... Kelly and Richie , are having very violent seizures . Yeah , Joey Grossman was pulled out . He 's not having any . Well , that 's because he was only there a short time . All this bullshit is academic . Look , let me reduce it for you . If one of these pieces-of-computer-code freaks is behind all this ... what we wanna know is , is what does it want with these kids ? Okay , that was my contact at the P.D. I had her run a name of the detective whose card you got from the doctor ... and there is no Sam Jakowski in the police department . So I had her run a reverse search on the phone number on the card . It 's a cell-phone number. lt 's not even listed . So who is this guy ? Yeah , and why is he asking questions ... that someone might ask if they knew about Sentients ? Well , there 's one way to find out . Can 't see anyone . That 's him , you guys . Guess what ? We were right . All right . Let 's go . Mr Jakowski , I presume ? - Yeah . Smith ? - Well , actually , Smith ain 't my real name . - Yeah , I guessed that . - Any more than Jakowski ain 't yours . What ? Tell me what your sentient wants with those children . Answer the damn question , you piece of ooze . This is boring me shitless . I say we torture him . Though I 'm sure you would enjoy doing that ... I 'm not sure it would accomplish anything . And anyway , does this synthetic even feel pain ? Why don 't we find out ? No . - Don 't . - What ? I am not comfortable with the idea of torture , okay ? It 's not right . It is a machine. lt is not animal , vegetable or mineral. lt is a fucking machine . You wouldn 't have tortured Harry that way . No , I wouldn 't have tortured Harry that way , but Harry didn 't kill my wife . Chuck . Now tell me what your streaky-deaky leader is doing with these kids and why . Chuck , you might disrupt his circuitry permanently . - So what ? - So what ? In a sense , you 'd kill him . Well , it better tell me what I wanna know before that happens , right ? - Neil , talk to him . - Talk to your father , please . No . Answer my fucking question ! Answer it ! My sentient ... is not the one who is affecting your progeny . He wants the same ... thing as you . Well done , I think you fried a few synthetic brain cells . What same thing as me ? What exactly is that ? - To stop them . - Them ? Them , them , them , them , them . Who the fuck is them ? You are them . What are you trying to do , mind-fuck me again ? Stop ! You 've damaged him already ! You 're gonna kill him ! I 'll kill it ! It thinks I 'm expendable . It thinks my wife is expendable . I think it 's expendable ! Chuck , we need information from it ! God ! - Do they even have a pulse ? - The one I made did . This one 's different from ours , but an equivalent concept . - Congratulations , Chuck , you killed it . - Well , it wasn 't alive . Well , it could have told us exactly what those Synthetics were trying to stop ! But thanks to you , that 's not gonna happen ! Hello ? Mrs Forbes , it 's Heather Grossman , Joey 's mom . - Yes . Heather , what 's wrong ? - He 's gone . I 'm sorry I 'm calling so late and the police are already on their way here . It 's just that I thought that maybe you could ... . I don 't know what I was thinking . Okay , Mrs Grossman , just slow down and take a deep breath . What happened ? Did you see him leave ? No . I heard a noise , and I got up , and he was already gone . And it looks like he took his science project with him . His science project ? What science project ? I don 't know. lt was some electronic thing he was working on . He was very secretive about it . Okay , Mrs Grossman , just take it easy and wait for the police . I 'll be there as soon as I can . Okay ? Joey Grossman took off in the middle of the night . - He took some electronic thing with him . - What kind of thing ? She doesn 't know . She said he was working on it ... in the bedroom , and he was very secretive about it . Something electronic , computer-related ? All right , I 'm thinking the first thing we need to do ... is get down to that computer lab . - Yeah , I 'm thinking the same thing . - All right. I 'll call Dad . Nothing . Listen . Yeah , I hear it . Sounds like children . - Now why do I think those are Synthetics ? - Short bet is they 've come for those kids . It 's not gonna happen . Put your light down to the end of the pool . Okay , Neil , lock the door and stay by it . Sarah , get down to the other end of the pool to help us . Let 's get these kids out of here . Sarah , get in here ! Give us a hand . Get these kids out of the water ! We 're out of time . Get ' em out of the water ! Get those kids out of the water ! - Get them out ! - Get the kids ! No , no , no . Don 't ! is everybody okay ? Kids ? Unfortunately , none of the kids remember what happened ... what they were building , or anything to do with last night . I wouldn 't call that unfortunate . Those are the kind of memories that 'll give a child nightmares for years . It 's not that . What he 's saying , it 's unfortunate ... those kiddies can 't tell us nothing . Yeah , well , I feel bad for the family that lost their child . They 're gonna be searching for him for the rest of their lives . But it doesn 't make sense that the sentient involved ... was coaching the children to build a device designed simply ... to kill them and make them disappear . I agree with you , but what the hell was that electronic asshole doing there ? My best guess , I think the sentient was making them build a transportation device . He took the boy and those Synthetics somewhere . - Like where ? Off the planet ? - Or to another dimension . No one knows . All right , has anybody else considered the idea ... that when we watched the Earth go boom ... right before it happened , there was a blinding flash of light ... much like the light we saw last night at the pool ? That 's right . And the first blinding flash of the light disappeared some kids ... some of those freaks and some water . And a bigger flash of light disappeared the whole world , which went boom . Common denominator here ... is that satellite we were trying to hang up was called Bright Sky . - Hi . - Hey . I think we have a conversation to finish . Right . - l 'm sorry . - For what ? Holly , what 's going on ? - What we did the other day ... . - Yeah , I thought it- - lt was a mistake . Okay . I was going to say special , but ... . No , it was great . Physically , it was great . Don 't get me wrong. lt 's just there was no ... . What ? I don 't think we should do it again . Okay . Okay . Holly , listen . Please know that I don 't want you to be uncomfortable about us being physical ever . That 's not what I mean . It 's not just that . Are you breaking up with me ? When we were doing rapture ... when our minds connected ... I think I saw something . - What ? - l don 't know. I don 't remember. I just ... . lt 's weird . I just know it was something really bad . I know that doesn 't make any sense , but ... . This wasn 't supposed to happen like this . - Neil , I 'm sorry . - Me , too . I wanted you to know the truth . Neil . Neil . - l 'll call you , okay ? - Yeah . Hello . Claire ? - Hi . - Hi . - Any sign of change ? - No . - Thank you for that . - Well , it 's the least I could do . I don 't understand why you feel you should do anything . You barely know him . Well , I 'm getting to know you , and I 'd like to do anything I can to help you . Besides , I like to get exposed to new music . Not that I 'd be listening to the Budro Sisters anytime soon , but ... . First time I heard them , I walked into Zack 's room ... and he had them cranked ... and instead of kicking me out , like he usually did ... he grabbed my hands , and we started to dance . - Really ? - Yeah . First time I had any clue that he could dance . He 's good , too . He was twirling me and dipping me . - His dad used to dance like that . - lt 's all right . Son of a bitch . I didn 't only buy this for Zack . - May I ? - Kidding ? Come on . Music is the best medicine . Come on . - Thanks for coming . - Anytime , honey . I 'll take your bag out to the taxi . Here . Allow me . There you go . Thanks , Chuck . Bye , Sis .

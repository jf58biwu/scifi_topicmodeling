 Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love ? JINGLE SINGERS : Call Robo-Rooter if you flush a towel We also help with an impacted bowel JINGLE SINGERS : Robo-Rooter Now this is progress : A self-microwaving Bavarian Cream Dog . Let 's just pray I have the energy to get another beer . What is this , the Middle Ages ? Look at you . - You 've become a fat sack of crap . - Sack ? Bender , your beer belly 's so big your door won 't close . - And that doesn 't make sense . - You 're coming to the gym . The gym ? Excellent ! Excellent ! For some reason , I 'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday . Who 's up for a steam ? Crustaceans don 't like steam . I 'll work out with the Nautilus . - What up , Dr. Z ? - Yo , yo . What 's up ? Give up the rock ! Coed steam rooms . I love the future . You 're in the women 's steam room . Ah , futuristic . Look what life was like before genetic engineering . The poor 20th-century women . Hey , handsome . Have room for two ? You wish . Hey , Leela , look who 's the super stud . Someone must have turned down the gravity . Give me that ! More weight ! What 's that jazz on your head ? Enough questions . More weight ! More ! More ! [ ROARS ] Maybe you could do more reps with less weight . Looks like Zoidberg 's finally coming out of his shell ! Get it ? He 's coming out ... Nice and gentle . We don 't want any unnecessary stress . [ BABY CRIES ] - Is there a doctor in the gym ? - I 'm a doctor ! [ WOMEN SCREAMING ] [ BABIES CRYING ] Why 's he acting this way ? - He seemed the most normal . - I am normal . Amy , take off these rubber bands , and I 'll show you . Fool me seven times , shame on you . Fool me eight times , shame on me . - Maybe he has a parasite . - Maybe he is one . It 's sad when a friend goes nuts and you have to have a clambake and cook him . Yee-ha ! This won 't do . Let me give old Zoidie a sedative . - Much better . You can remove these . - I 'll do it . - Look out ! - Moron ! Hmm . Ooh . Aha ! There 's the problem . Give it to me straight . Is it fin rot ? It 's fin rot , isn 't it ? Relax , chum . It 's no problem . You 're just heavy with male jelly . Blech ! It 's mating season for his people . A time when his behavior is run by the brain in his rump . Yuck ! - There 's one thing we can do . - I 'll boil the water . We , I mean you , have to rush him to his ancient home world which will soon erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex . - Oh , baby , I 'm there ! - Do you understand " invertebrate " ? It 's not the word I care about . No need to pack pants . Let 's roll ! Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these . BENDER : Moron ! Welcome home , old friend ! Just 1 9 hours until the mating frenzy ! - Excellent ! Excellent ! - See ya there , Doctor : That 's how you say " Zoidberg " ? You didn 't have to point out his speech impediment . - You 're looking less nuts . - I 'm feeling less nuts . Tomorrow I 'll be depositing jelly in the cloacal vents of a female . Catch my drift ? - Who 's the lobsterina ? - Not sure . I shall attract one today with an erotic display . Your people fall in love so fast . " Love " ? That word 's unknown here . I want a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material . You and me both . Ah ! My old scuttling grounds . Let 's pull over . I used to hang out here as a larva . It looked much bigger then . Who 's the tough guy now , Vinnie ? Look ! Outdoor theater ! Let 's get tickets ! It 's the Ceremony of Claw Plock . We fight to the death over honor and whether abbreviations count in Scrabble . They don 't ! I didn 't come to see two guys . Where do you do your erotic display ? Same as your species . The beach ! - How do I look ? - Like whale barf . Then the illusion is complete . I wonder if they 're here to watch the erotic display too . Perfect . This ought to make me stand out . - Look how silly they look . - He 's no different from you organisms shooting DNA at each other to make babies . It 's offensive ! Keep your jelly away from my eggs . So not interested . I 've heard that before . What 's the point ? Why 's he still alone ? He 's a loser , that 's why . The lobster equivalent of Fry . I can get any girl , any time . I 'm just too busy . Edna ! Edna , it 's me , Zoidberg . Remember ? From high school . My face was covered with barnacles . I didn 't know you were back in town . I heard you became a rich doctor . I 've performed a few mercy killings . So , as long as I 'm in town , I was wondering if maybe , well ... . Gee . Yeah , I 'm just going through a lot of things right now , and ... Look , I carry more eggs than other females . I owe it to our race to pick a mate stuffed with jelly . - Maybe a rock star . - Or a doctor ? I 'm sorry . You 're just an inferior male specimen . Nice seeing you again . No one will ever mate with me . Not with a puny claw like this . Did you see those guys ? They were giant claws with bodies . - You didn 't smell as bad . - You 're right . My stink gland is weak . Smell ! You gotta fake like you 're in love . Look in her eyes , start crying and say , " I 've never been so happy . " If a guy ever did that , I 'd know it . Wait a second . They 've all done that . Even Sean ! This " love " intrigues me . Teach me to fake it ! You 're on a date . What do you do ? - Ask her to mate . - Say she 's special . She 's not . She just has the largest clutch of eggs . - Well , tell her that . Then ? - Then mating . No . Make up feelings and tell her you have them . - Is " desire to mate " a feeling ? - You 're not even trying ! It 's all so complicated . The romance and the lies upon lies . Don 't worry . The love meister will take you under his wing . Now there 's a bird involved ? Okay , go ahead . What the ... ? Dr. Zoidberg ? Your display failed . Why are you trying to talk to me ? I don 't know . You just want to talk . I just want to talk . That doesn 't make sense . That doesn 't make sense . But okay . Tell her she looks thin . You seem malnourished . Do you suffer from parasites ? Yes . Thanks for noticing . - Ask about her day . - Why would I care ? - You wouldn 't . Ask . - How was your day ? Well , first I got up and had a piece of toast . Then I went to the store . And ... Look , she won 't shut up . It 's normal . Just nod and say , " Uh-huh . " - Uh-huh . Uh-huh . - And then you threw an octopus . It 's crazy , but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies seem less obvious . Your genes seem less detrimental . You even stink more . - Ask to mate ? - Third date . So I returned his artificial heart . Since then , I 've been called " Honest Bender . " " I 'd like to propose a toast to coat check number 84 . " - Turn it over . - Oh . " Edna ! Of all the gross crab monsters on this planet you are the hottest . " Oy . - That 's the most beautiful thing . - Yes . Well excuse me . I must powder my flaps . Me too . I 'm confused . I 'm feeling a strange new emotion . Is it love when you care for a female for reasons beyond mating ? No . Must be some alien emotion . He said some dumb stuff . He 's a nice guy . Really . Fry 's been telling him what to say . And Fry 's a ... - Do you have idiots on your planet ? - Fry ? Words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien ? Yeah . What ? Look , never mind the words . Zoidberg 's a doctor . A doctor , honey . EDNA : Come in . Hello , Fry . Can I interest you in some surf and turf ? I came to tell you that Zoidberg 's great . He 's got jelly out the wazoo . That is where it comes out . It 's not everything . I know Zoidberg 's words were yours . Teach me to love , you squishy poet from beyond ! I 'm flattered . If I did it with a mud bug , you 'd top the list . Hush , you romantic fool . Engage your mandibles and kiss me . Edna ? I couldn 't stand it any longer . L ... Fry ! It 's not how it looks ! - Her caviar is on your neck ! - But ... It 's true , Zoidberg . We can 't hide it any longer . We 're in love , and we 're mating tomorrow ! - What ? ! - Fry ! I challenge you to Claw Plock ! - English , please ? - A fight to the death ! And if you survive , we 'll make sweet love . The law is clear . Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the beautiful Edna . But I don 't want her ! The tradition of Claw Plock can 't be taken back . It is a recent tradition , only 1 8 years old , but it is a tradition . I 'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you ! This is madness ! You 're being irrational ! - Of course I am . I 'm in love ! - Aw . - Leela ! - Right , right . You have to stop this . Listen , lady . As you can see I 'm a highly desirable male groaning with jelly . Yet I embrace celibacy to uphold our crazy traditions . - One of your friends must die . - Fate is cruel and unyielding . And what must be , must be . Taking bets ! 9-to-2 on Zoidberg , the crab with the jab ! The Great Red Hope ! Come on , baby ! It 's been years since medical school . Remind me : - Disemboweling you , fatal or not ? - Fatal . Large bet on me in round one ! Edna , have you anything to say before begins the Claw Plock ? I do . Today I got up and I had a piece of toast then I brushed my teeth ... - Shut up ! - I love you , Fry ! No ! Having guessed what animal I was thinking of you have first choice of weapon . - And you , doctor ? - I choose my claws . I want to chop him here , in the gonads . Nobody correct him . Fry , I 've never asked for anything before ... . When it comes to the ninth round , let him win . - It 's a fight to the death ! - Suddenly it 's all about you ! Sheesh . Please rise for the national anthem . Uh-oh . Let Claw Plock begin ! Go , Fry ! Die with dignity ! Oops ! No ! I can 't stand to look ! What ? Fry ! Take a dive ! Claw Plock ! Claw Plock ! Claw Plock ! Claw Plock ! Claw Plock ! Fellow fish monsters , I don 't want to question your stupid civilization but will killing someone with a nutcracker solve anything ? He 's my friend . Though a woman has come between us we 'll remain friends . And do you know why ? One reason . You bastard ! I 'll kill you ! You bastard ! Wait ! Stop ! Everyone is gone ! Edna ? Honey ? Edna ? Oh , my God ! The frenzy ! Oh , the greatest experience in life and I missed it . I 'm sorry , doc . The frenzy is over . How will I get rid of my jelly now ? - I 'll lend you this . - Fry . - Hey ! - Shoo ! Get away . Hey ! What 's with the flying jerks ? They feast after the frenzy . Once my species passes its genes , it dies . You choose between life without sex and death ? - Yes . - Tough call . It was nice of you to let me fix your arm . Especially after I made an eel out of myself . - No biggie . - Yes , biggie . I felt things I never felt before : Love , jealousy , passion for disemboweling . I owe it all to you . I pronounce the operation a success . - Hooray ! - Yeah ! I don 't know emotions . But medicine , forget about it . Not to nitpick , doc , but could you take one more whack at this ? For you , my friend , anything . FRY : Ahh ! My legs ! ZOIDBERG : All right ... Third time 's the charm .

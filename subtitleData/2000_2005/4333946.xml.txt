 Didn 't hardly have to convert the ship , even . Six in the corner . Stronger locks , thicker doors . Keep everybody where they 're supposed to be . Don 't even need more rations . - [ Man ] Hey . - [ Men Groaning ] - Wait . - Come on ! [ Moans ] [ Groaning ] - You made money , huh ? - Hand over fist , my friend . Water planets need labor . Terra-forming crews got a prodigious death rate . Labor ? You mean , uh , slaves . Well , they wasn 't volunteers , for damn sure . That why you didn 't have to lay in more rations ? I didn 't hear no complaints . [ Jayne ] How much money ? Lots ? There 's , uh , a chance you might wanna head back to the ship . I 'm all right . This is entertaining , actually . - Yeah ? What 's entertaining ? - I like watching the game . Plus the other situations . The key seems to be ... - giving Jayne a heavy stick and standing back . - Ha ! Still , might ought to clear out before too much longer . - Seems there 's a thief about . - Thief ? Yeah . Took this right off him . Now , they earned that with the sweat of their slave-trading brows . - Mal . - Oh , terrible shame . 'Course , they won 't discover it till they go order their next round of drinks . - Wei . - Good drinker , that one . Lovely place . I 'll tell my friends . ~ Take my love , take my land ~ ~ Take me where I cannot stand ~ ~ I don 't care , I 'm still free ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Take me out to the black ~ ~ Tell them I ain 't comin 'back ~ ~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ There 's no place I can be ~ ~ Since I 've found serenity ~ ~ But you can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Seem to you we cleared out of Santho in a hurry ? Seems to me we do that a lot . Heard tell , though , we 're gonna stay a while on Persephone . - Shiny . - Yeah ? Thought you get land crazy that long in port . Probably , but I 've been sane a long while now , and change is good . Well , ain 't that a joyful sight . - You gotta love a sunset . - Startin ' to get familiar too . - Like a second home . - Persephone ain 't home . Too many people we need to avoid . Resupply ... look for work , move along . We sniff the air . We don 't kiss the dirt . Wasn 't planning on the dirt kissing , sir . I wouldn 't stand for it anyway , Captain , jealous man like me . - [ Beeping ] - Closing in . [ Zoe ] Planet 's coming up a might fast . That 's just ' cause I 'm goin ' down too quick . Likely crash and kill us all . - Well , if that happens , let me know . - Okay . - Whoa ! No , we 're good . - [ Rumbling ] We 're good . It 's okay . I understand your time on our planet is limited ... and if you selected my proposal to hear ... then the honor you do me flatters my- - my honor . And I hope- - Now there 's the smile made of sunlight . Atherton . How wonderful to see you . Did you get my message ? I was extra appealing . What a flattering invitation . I had no idea I was arriving in time ... for the social event of the season . So , you 'll accompany me ? I ask , heart in my throat . There 's a certain offer I 'm still waiting to hear about . - [ Knocking ] - Yes , I imagine there is . I 'm delighted to say I 'll be there . - Now , I 'm sorry , Atherton . I have to run . - No , please . I understand . I 'll see you soon , baobei . - Good afternoon , Captain . - Morning . We 're downing in case Wash don 't kill us all . Local time 's gonna be in the a.m. , 10 : 00 or so . Yes , I saw that . Making plans ? Atherton Wing . Now , he 's a regular , ain 't he ? - I 've seen him before . - Oh , I never did . Not what I pictured . Young . Must be rich too to afford your rates . I suppose . He has engaged me for several days . Days ? One must have stamina . Mmm . He does . Well , fine . Is he letting 'you out at all ? Actually , we 're attending a ball tomorrow night . Tell me , do all the men there pay for their dates ... or just young rich ones with stamina ? Most of the women there will not be Companions ... if that 's what you 're asking . Perhaps the other men couldn 't attract one . Hmm . It sounds like ... the finest party I could imagine gettin ' paid to go to . I don 't suppose you 'd find it up to the standards of your outings . More conversation and somewhat less petty theft and getting hit with pool cues . Oh . [ Chuckles ] I understand if you need to go prepare ... for that " It 's 10 : 00 in the morning " issue . Yeah . Better go do that . 'Cause I think this is more of , uh , an evening look . Ooh . Look at the pretties ! What am I looking at , the girls or the clothes ? - [ Jayne ] The girls . - The clothes , please . Say , look at the fluffy one . [ Zoe ] Too much foofaraw . If I 'm gonna wear a dress , I want something with some slink . You want a slinky dress ? I can buy you a slinky dress . Captain , can I have money for a slinky dress ? - I 'll chip in . - I can hurt you . The only place I seen something so nice is some of the things Inara has . Well , we 'd best be movin ' . I guess she needs all that stuff , the life she leads . Well , sure . Sometimes the customers buy her things . You know , some real rich men . Come on . These ain 't feathers I 'm totin ' here , you know . I like the ruffles . Inara gets to wear whatever she wants . What are you gonna do in that rig ? Waltz around the engine room ? Be like a sheep walkin ' on its hind legs . [ Jayne Laughs ] See you on the ship , Captain . Ohh . What , is she mad or something ? [ Weapon Cocking , Whirring ] - Badger . - Captain Reynolds . Heard you was in town . Thought we might have a bit of a sit-down . Prefer a bit of a " piss off . " I 'm very sorry . Did I give you the impression I was askin ' ? Seems to me the last time there was a chance for a little palaver ... we were all manner of unwelcome . This ain 't bad . There 's a trick to it . Wood alcohol . Now we 're favored guests ... treated to the finest in beverages that make you blind . So what is it you need ? - Here . Excuse me . - There 's a local ... by the name of Warrick Harrow . Got some property he wants to sell off-planet . Fetch a high price . The local powers won 't let him sell off-world . It 's a conundrum . What my man Harrow needs himself is a smuggler . - Willin ' to cut you in on it . - Why me ? You have access to ships . You could do it yourself . Won 't deal with me direct . He 's takin ' an irrational dislike . What happened ? He see your face ? He 's a quality gent . Nose in the air like he never [ Speaking Chinese ] . Don 't find me respectable . But you- - You , I figure , got a chance . You backed out of a deal last time , left us hangin ' . - Hurt our feelings . - You recall why that took place ? Had a problem with your attitude is why . Felt you was- - What 's the word ? - Pretentious ? - Exactly . You think you 're better than other people . Just the ones I 'm better than . And now I 'm thinkin that very quality ... is the one you 're placing value on today . I place value on the fact that stick up your pigu ... is about as large as the one that Harrow 's got . How would you even set up a meet ? The man won 't deal with you . Know a place he 'll be . Safe place . Usin ' some new tech gun scans . High class too . Won 't let me in there . You might slip in . 'Course , you couldn 't buy an invite with a diamond the size of a testicle . I got my hands on a couple . Of invites . You want this meetin ' or not ? - [ Chattering ] - ~ ~ [ Classical ] Colonel Cyrus Mumsen and escort . William and Lady Courtland . Atherton Wing and Inara Serra . Roberta , it 's been too long . [ Speaking Chinese ] Half the men in this room wish you were on their arm tonight . Only half ? I must be losing ... my undefinable allure . Oh , it 's not that undefinable . All of them wish they were in your bed . - I 'm looking for the boy with the shimmer wine . - Oh , she blushes . Not many in your line of work do that . You are a very singular woman , and I find- - I find I admire you more and more . Kaylee . Kaylee . I 'm not speaking to you , Captain . Got no need to speak . Come on . Got a job for you . ~ ~ [ Chamber ] I 'm trying to offer you something , you know . A life ... if you want it . Atherton . You can live here on Persephone as my personal Companion . You 're a generous man . That is not a yes . It 's not a no either . You look gorgeous , dear . You belong here , Inara , not on a flying piece of go-se . - You see that , don 't you ? - Atherton , language . What ? Piece of go-se ? But it is a piece of go-se . [ Man ] Miss Kaywinnit Lee Frye and escort . Kaylee ? Oh , go-se . [ Mal ] Does , um- - Does this seem kind of tight ? It shows off your backside . Did you see the chandelier ? It 's hovering . - What 's the point of that , I wonder ? - Oh , mangos ! [ Mal ] I see how they did it . I just ain 't gettin 'the why . These girls have the most beautiful dresses . - And so do I. How about that ? - Yeah , well , just be careful . We cheated Badger out of good money to buy that frippery ... and you 're supposed to make me look respectable . Yes , sir , Captain Tight-pants . Okay . I 'm lookin for our guy Harrow . And Inara . We should look for her , right ? Just to say hello at her . Well , if we see her . I think she 's wearing gold . Okay , help me find our man . He 's supposed to be older , kind of stocky . - Wears a red sash crossways . - Why does he do that ? Maybe he won the Miss Persephone pageant.Just help me look . Is that him ? That 's the buffet table . Well , how can we be sure unless we question it ? Fine . Don 't make yourself sick . Xie-xie , Captain . Ante up , gentlemen . Dishes . Dishes . Could do with less of them . Garbage . Tall card . Plum . Plums are tall . I 'll take two . Two . - No tall card claim . - Speakin ' of garbage , I 'll take three . Three . Dealer forced to claim the tall . What do you suppose the captain and Kaylee are doing now ? Septic vac . Eatin 'steaks off of plates made of solid money , like as anything . - I fold . - [ Simon ] Me too . - Tall cards ' round my neck like a weight . - Take it , Shepherd . Ah , that 's a nice pile of things I don 't have to do . It 's the ones that 'll take you . They 're the ones reaching and doing it . - They 're the ones keeping you- - - River ? - Is she hurt ? You 'd better see to her . That 's a bad habit for a fugitive . - Calm down . - Do that in public , get herself hauled off . - They 're everywhere . - Calm down . - Hands go everywhere and [ Babbling ] - - - It 's okay . Shh . She didn 't harm much . We 'll have a few mystery meals . - Sometimes ... afraid . - It 's okay . It 's okay . Shh , shh , shh , shh . And they come . So are we gonna play cards or screw around ? [ Moaning ] Ahh . I thought you wanted to spend more time off-ship this visit . Ohh . Out there it seems like it 's all fancy parties . - Mmm . - I like our party better . The dress code 's easier , and I know all the steps . [ Chuckling ] I 'd say you do at that . Oh . - Mmm . - Don 't fall asleep now . Sleepiness is weakness of character . Ask anyone . - It is not . - You are acting captain . Know what happens if you fall asleep now ? Jayne slits my throat and takes over . - That 's right . - And we can 't stop it . Well , I wash my hands of it . It 's a hopeless case . I 'll read a nice poem at the funeral , something with imagery . You could lock the door and keep the power-hungry maniac at bay . I don 't know . I 'm starting to like this poetry idea now . Oh . Here lies my beloved Zoe ... - my autumn flower . - [ Slapping Flesh ] Somewhat less attractive now that she 's all corpsified and gross . [ Laughing ] Oh , no ! ~ ~ [ Chamber ] Aren 't they something ? They 're like butterflies or little pieces of wrapping paper blowing around . Hello . Don 't , um- - Have we been introduced ? Oh . I 'm Kaylee . Banning . And this is Dester , Cabott and Zoe . Don 't you just love this party ? Everything 's so fancy , and there 's some kind of hot cheese over there . It 's not as good as last year . Oh , really ? What 'd they have last year ? Standards . Who made your dress , Kaylee ? Oh , do you like it ? When I saw the ruffles , I just couldn 't resist . You ought to see to your girl . - Shu muh ? - Your girl . She 's not very good . She made you a dress looks like you bought it in a store . Oh . I didn 't know . Why , Banning Miller . What a vision you are in your fine dress . Must 've taken a dozen slaves a dozen days to get you into that getup . 'Course , your daddy tells me it takes the space of a schoolboy 's wink ... to get you out of it again . Forgive my rudeness . I cannot abide useless people . Oh , no . Thank you very much . Beg your pardon , but would you be Mr. Warrick Harrow ? Sir Warrick Harrow . The sash . The sash ? It indicates lord-hood . And it 's- - it 's doing a great job . Sir , my name 's Malcom Reynolds . I captain a ship named Serenity . I mention this because I 've been led to understand ... - you want to move some property off-world . - [ Inara ] Stop it . [ Chuckling ] Some property you want to move off-world discreetly . You 're mistaken , sir . I 'm an honest man . It seems to me there 's nothing dishonest ... about getting your goods to people what need ' em . Whom do you represent ? Represent isn 't exactly the- - - Don 't waste my time . - Fellow called Badger . I know him , and I think he 's a psychotic lowlife . And I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic lowlife community . But the deal is solid . Sorry to interrupt . Sir Warrick , I know you from the club , I believe . Captain , this is Atherton Wing . Atherton , Captain Mal Reynolds . Pleased to meet ya . Inara , I didn 't realize you were going to this party . - It 's the only party . - And I can see why . How about that floating chandelier ? Almost outshines our girl here . Ath- - Can I call you Ath ? Inara has spoken of you to me . She made a point of your generosity . Given that , I 'm sure you won 't mind if I ask Inara the favor of a dance ? Of course . - You 're a brave man . - I know what 's mine . This dance I think I actually know . - Why are you here ? - Business . Same as you . I was talking to a contact about a smuggling job , and you came over to me . - You were staring at me . - I saw you is all . You stand out . In this company , Captain , I believe you 're the one who stands out . Well , maybe I just want to see a professional at work . Is this the hardest part , or does that come later ? You have no call trying to make me ashamed of my job . What I do is legal . And how 's that smuggling coming ? - My work 's illegal , but at least it 's honest . - What ? Well , this- - the lie of it . That man parading you around on his arm as if he actually won you ... as if he loves you , and everyone here going along with it . These people like me , and I like them . - I like Atherton too , by the way . - Well , sure . What 's not to like ? I 'm liable to sleep with him myself . And he likes me whether you see it or not . - Of course . - He 's made me an offer . You may think he doesn 't honor me , but he wants me to live here . I 'd be his personal Companion . I could belong here . Call me pretentious , but there is appeal in that . You 're right . Got no call to stop you . You 've got the right to a decent life . - I see Kaylee 's here . - Cried Cinderella tears- - You should have seen her ... when I told her she could have that layer cake she 's wearing . I think she looks adorable . Yeah , but I never said it . I 'm not saying the 80-04 is hard to repair . - It just ain 't worth it . - It 's a fine machine . You just keep it tuned . [ Speaking Chinese ] The extenders ain 't braced . I 've been telling him to buy an 80-10 for years . Those ' tenders snap off , don 't matter how good the engine 's cyclin ' . - Miss Kaylee , if I could request the honor- - - Wait a minute . Let her talk . She 's talkin ' . By the way , the 80-10 's the same machine . They just changed the plating , hoped no one noticed . [ All Laughing ] Possible you 're right . This ain 't my kind of party . Whoa , now . Watch yourself . No need for hands on . Excuse me . She 's not here with you , Captain . She 's mine . Yours ? She don 't belong to nobody . Money changed hands , which makes her mine tonight . And no matter how you dress her up , she 's still- - - Turns out this is my kind of party . - Oh , Mal . What ? The man was out of line . - I accept . - That 's great . What ? - There has been a challenge . - I hope you 're prepared , Captain . What , you all talkin ' about a fight ? Well , that 's fine . - Let 's get out of here . - It 's not a fistfight , Mal . The duel will be met tomorrow morning at Kaytree Pond . Well , why wait ? Where 's that guard ? He collected a whole mess of pistols . If you require it , any gentleman here can give you use of a sword . Use of a sw- - what ? - What 's going on ? - I 'm not rightly sure . What 's going on ? Well , first off , you 'll be put up in lodgings for the night , so you don 't disappear . I wouldn 't blame you , incidentally . Wing may be a spoiled dandy , but he 's an expert swordsman . He 's killed a dozen men with the long blade . You 're the only one gave him a reason . - Oh , this is a joke . - [ Inara ] You 'll need a second . - What 's that ? - I 'll take on the job . - He fights if you refuse . Inara , come with me , please . Now , you taking on this job ... being my second- - does this mean we 're in business ? It means you 're in mortal danger . But you mussed up Atherton 's face , and that has endeared you to me somewhat . You might even give him a fight ... before he guts you . [ Atherton ] Inara . Up until the punching , it was a real nice party . [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Pounding ] The captain 's gone and got himself in trouble . - A duel ? - With swords ? The captain 's a good fighter . He must know how to handle a sword . I think he knows which end to hold . All right , so wejust need to figure out how to get him out of there . We have until the morning , correct ? - Do you know what lodging he 's in ? - Oh ! This is embarrassing . Some of you seem ... to be misapprehending my purpose in being here . You 're here to make sure we don 't do what these men are keen on doing . Penny for the smart lady . Persephone 's my home . I gotta do business with the people here . I don 't want it known I brought someone in caused this kind of ruckus . We 'll just settle in till this blows over ... - one way or the other . - [ Weapon Cocking , Whirring ] - Jayne , I wouldn 't . - Why not ? - [ Weapons Cocking ] - Hi . - Mal ? - [ Mal ] Whoa . What are you doin ' here ? Atherton 's a heavy sleeper night before a big day . You know , he 's got that killing in the morning , then a haircut later . Such a comfort having friends visit at a time like this . - [ Grunts ] - I knew the accommodations would be nice . Atherton doesn 't skimp . I don 't suppose I like being kept by him as much as others do . So ... how come you 're still attached to him ? Because it 's my decision , not yours . Thought he made it pretty clear he 's got no regard for you . You did manage to push him into saying something , yes . Made a nice justification for the punch . He insulted you . I hit him . Seemed like the thing to do . Why 'd this get so complicated ? Well , it 's about to get simpler . There 's a back door . The desk clerk is on alert . He 'll let us out . Whoa , I 'm not runnin ' off . And I don 't know what you got in your head ... but I didn 't do this to prove some kind of point to you . I actually thought I was defending your honor . And I never back down from a fight . Yes , you do . You do all the time . Well , yeah . But I 'm not backing down from this one . He 's an expert swordsman , Mal . You had trouble with the pillar . How will your death help my honor ? Well , see , I plan on having it be his death . That 's why I need lessons . I figure you know how , bein ' such an educated woman and all . He said not to do anything . He 'll join us after he wins the duel . [ Jayne ] And what if he don 't win ? Doesn 't hurt to have a contingency plan , Kaylee . I 'm thinking since we 're unarmed ... we should take them by surprise . - All at once . - [ Zoe ] Not necessarily . We can lure one or two of 'em away . Say , infirmary . Take ' em out , be on Badger before he knows what happens . [ Jayne ] Only if his attention is elsewhere . What we need 's a diversion . I say Zoe gets naked . - Nope . - I could get naked . - No ! - [ Zoe ] No . - River , you can 't be here . - [ Indistinct ] Come on ! - River ! River , please . - [ Badger ] Who 's that , then ? Here , look at me . What 's your story , love ? She 's just , uh--just a passenger . Yeah ? Why ain 't she talkin ' ? She got a secret ? - No , I 'm- - - [ Cockney Accent ] Sure . I got a secret . More than one . Don 't seem like that I tell ' em to you now , do it ? Anyone off Titan colony knows better than to talk to strangers . You 're talkin ' loud enough for the both of us , though , ain 't ya ? I 've met a dozen like you . Skipped off-home early . Minor graft jobs here and there . Spent some time in the lockdown , but less than you claim . And you 're , what , a petty thief with delusions standing ? Sad little king of a sad little hill . Nice to see someone from the old homestead . Not really . Call me if anyone interesting shows up . I like her . That there- - exactly the kind of diversion we could 've used . Attack . - [ Groans ] - How did I avoid that ? By being fast like a freak ? No . Because you always attack the same way ... swinging from the shoulder like you 're chopping wood . You have to thrust with the point sometimes or-or swing from the elbow . - Swinging from the shoulder feels stronger . - It 's also slower , Mal . You don 't need strength as much as speed . We 're fragile creatures . It takes less than a pound of pressure to cut skin . You know that ? They teach you that in whore academy ? You have a strange sense of nobility , Captain . You 'll lay a man out for implying I 'm a whore , but you keep calling me one to my face . I might not show respect to your job , but he didn 't respect you . That 's the difference . Inara , he doesn 't even see you . Well , I guess death will solve the issue to everyone 's satisfaction . This [ Chinese ] duel is the result of the rules of your society , not mine . You are always breaking the rules , no matter what society you 're in . You don 't get along with ordinary criminals either ... which is why you are constantly getting in trouble . You think following the rules will buy you a nice life ... even if the rules make you a slave . Don 't take his offer . What ? Don 't do it . Just in the case that it happens , that means that he 's the fellow who killed me ... and I don 't like fellows who kill me , not in general . I said before that I didn 't have call to stop you , and that 's true . Anyways , don 't . I need to get back . He 'll be up early . Right . He 's got that big day . Best be careful , Ath . You know , these things are sharp . - He thinks he 's doing well , doesn 't he ? - He 's being toyed with . - What 's he doing ? - Don 't fall for that ! Well , this isn 't going to take long , is it ? We 're coming up on the end , miss . You might not want to watch . Atherton , wait ! I 'll stay here , exclusive to you . Just let him live . [ Man ] He 's down . You have to finish it , lad . You have to finish it . For a man to lay beaten and yet breathing , it makes him a coward . - It 's humiliation . - Sure . It would be humiliating ... having to lie there while the better man refuses to spill your blood . Mercy is the mark of a great man . - [ Groans ] - Guess I 'm just a good man . - [ Groans ] - Well , I 'm all right . - [ Drops Sword ] - [ Groaning ] Inara ? Inara ! You 've lost her , lad . Be gracious . You set this up , whore ... after I bought and paid for you . I should 've uglied you up , so no one else would want you . See how I 'm not punching him ? I think I 've grown . Well , get ready to starve . I 'll see to it you never work again . Actually , that 's not how it works . You see , you 've earned yourself a black mark in the client registry . No Companion is going to contract with you ever again . You 'll have to rely on your winning personality to get women . God help you . [ Groans ] Ow , ow . You didn 't have to wound that man . Yeah , I know . It was just funny . You willing to fight that hard to protect my property ... I 'll have it in your hold before midnight . Mighty fine shindig . Doc 's filling the shepherd in on the plan . We 're ready to move on your signal . Doc is the diversion . Did you ever see such a lazy crew ? - Captain ! - You 're hurt . - You get us a deal ? - I got a deal . Now get off my ship . So , very much for a lovely night then . [ Whistles ] - Ow ! - Are you badly hurt ? [ Groans ] We was just about to spring into action , Captain . Complicated escape and rescue op . I was gonna watch . It was very exciting . ~ ~ [ Humming ] ~ ~ [ Classical ] Thank you for the wine . It 's ... very fresh . To Kaylee and her inter-engine fermentation system . - Are you in pain ? - Absolutely . - I got stabbed , you know , right here . - I saw . Don 't care much for fancy parties . - Too rough . - It wasn 't entirely a disaster . - I got stabbed , right here . - You also lined up exciting new crime . It 's good to have cargo . Makes us a target for every other scavenger out there , of course ... - but sometimes that 's fun too . - [ Chuckles ] I am grateful , you know , for the ill-conceived ... and highhanded attempt to defend my honor , although I didn 't want you to . Gracious as that is ... as I look back ... I probably should 've stayed out of your world . My world ? If it is that . I wasn 't gonna stay , you know . Yeah ? Why 's that ? Oh , someone needs to keep Kaylee out of trouble . And all my things are here . Besides , why would I want to leave serenity ? Can 't think of a reason . [ Lowing ] Grr ! Arrgh !

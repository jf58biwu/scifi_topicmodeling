 This pod is falling apart . It 's all I can do to keep her afloat . Chiana ? It 's not my fault , Crichton . I looked away for a microt and Jool grabbed the controls . I didn 't say it was your fault . Give me status . It 's not holding ! Oh , you 're getting mank everywhere . Shut the frell ! This is your fault ! - Look , there 's Moya . - Let 's just ... - Pilot , Aeryn , come in . Pilot ? That 's not Moya . That 's a Leviathan with a control collar . That means Peacekeepers . O-2 level 's falling . - Telemetry . Comms . Neuro-status . - We got nothing . All right , we 're heading for that ship . That 's it . - John , that is not an option ! We don 't have any options , unless you want to die out here in the middle of nowhere . It 's better than being captured , tortured and killed by the Peacekeepers . Do you hear that noise ? That 's our air ! - We have no comms . - We have no idea who or what is on that ship . You are leading us to our death . All right , that 's it . Everybody out ! Out ! What happened here ? That smell . If there were Peacekeepers , they 'd be here by now . Well , this section 's airlocked , so someone wants us here . D 'Argo ! What the hell 's going on out here ? I told you we shouldn 't have come here . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... It 's gone . Burnt , battered , busted . Ding dong , the Pod is dead . It can 't be dead , Crichton . You have to fix it and you have to get us out of here . Ain 't gonna happen . Not unless we can replace that stuff . We need threekay wire and narium coils . All right , we find it , we might stand a chance and that means a scavenger hunt in that direction . Look , can 't we just borrow one of their Transport Pods ? - There aren 't any . - I already looked . No Transport Pods . Not a single piece of escape craft . It 's like everybody who could leave , has left . This place is bad voojo . It 's a Leviathan like Moya . So spare parts , this way . I 'm getting back in the Transport Pod and I 'm staying there . Thank frek . No , you stay with her , Chiana . No way . Pip , Transport 's all we got . Oh . I 'm warning you , I 'm going to end up killing that redheaded tralk . Whatever . Go on . Spare parts . That way . Let 's find ' em . Frell . Trashed . Mmm . And there 's no threekay wire and definitely no narium coils . Anybody home ? Anybody out there ? Do you wanna give me a hand here ? It 's jammed . Or maybe there 's a Pilot keeping it shut . Or a host of Peacekeepers or thousands of feral hippie boy 's friends and relatives . It 's a bit late to worry about that . Let 's just get what we need for the Transport Pod and get the frell out of here . D 'Argo ! Chiana ! Chiana ? The comms are down . Chiana ! Could be the control collar . All right , we know the layout , right ? Okay , narium coils , threekay wire , got to be on Tiers Three and Four . Either that , or we head straight for Pilot . Crichton ... What you got , bigum ? Bones . Sebacean bones , maybe . All right . This way . Abbott and Costello in The House of Horror . You know , we should talk to the Pilot . He could tell us where to find all the stuff we need . Ah , Crichton . In here . Whoa ! Oh , man , that smells worse than Rygel . Well , almost . Get in . - Yep , threekay wire . Good call . - How 'd you know ? It 's a wild guess . This duct leads to the klestron filters . We 'll have to scrape out what we can . Ho ! Oh , man , that 's pus ! The ship is oozing pus , man . Yeah , this whole ship is diseased . Oh , geez . No DRDs . What 's that about ? It 's like she got hit by some kind of biochemical weapon . Narium coils , tier seven . Uh-uh . We got to find the Pilot . Crichton , we get what we need and we get out . What we need is the guy who controls the Maintenance Bay doors , the hangars , the whole damn ship in fact . This was meant to be a hit-and-run mission so we get the parts that we need . And what if weâ   re dying ? What if we 've been exposed to some radiation or some virus that 's gonna mutate us into the Night of the Living Dead ? Then the sooner we get out of here , the better . If you want to go all the way to Pilot ... - Hey , you know what ... then you 're tinked ! - we don 't know what we 're dealing with , here . This is a Peacekeeper prison ship . That 's all you need to know . I 'm going to go find the Pilot . You get the junk . What was that ? Uh ... External gyro-sensor . You broke it . I did not ! It just fell . I don 't believe this . What ? Where are you going ? Join the treasure hunt . Well , Crichton said to stay here . Yeah , well he didn 't know about this . Well , you can 't leave me . The comms are down . There 's a ... there 's a pulse rifle on the Transport Pod . How do I open this door ? You know , we don 't have weapons on our planet . We don 't have violence . We don 't have war ... What the frell ? Oh frelling hezmana ! See ? Violence . You 'll get the hang of it . Good luck with the pulse rifle . I hope you 're a fast learner . What the hell ? Holy mother of God . - Easy . I 'm not going to hurt you . My name is Crichton . I live on a Leviathan . We have a pilot . He 's ... kinda like you . What happened to you ? Please ... kill me . Come on ... Come out and play . Don 't mind me , just ... just talk amongst yourselves . Especially you . Stay back . Stay back ! What about your comms ? Atmosphere ? The doors ? Can you control any of that ? My neural pods slashed . Please kill me . Look , your arms are going to regenerate . Growgan . Cut urr ! Grogan ? Who the hell is Grogan ? Growgan ... Growgan cut ! Growgan cut ! They cut your arms ? And when they grow back , they hack ' em off again ? Why the hell would they do that ? Because , because ... because they 're eating me ! Stay back ... Stay back ! I don 't want to hurt you . Frell ! D 'Argo ! Crichton ! Frell . You want lunch ? How about her ? D 'Argo ! Crichton ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Who are you ? Where 's Chiana ? The Nebari ? Stay back ! Stay back or I swear I will kill you . I don 't think that 's very polite . No ! Crichton ! Ah ... No ! Pilot , what 's going on ? Starburst without any warning ? For yotz sake ! But we 've left Crichton and the others stranded . Votched up all my second lunch . It better be something good , Pilot . Moya was responding to a distress call . Perhaps you can see for yourself . Talyn . Crais , come in . This is Aeryn . Crais ? Pilot , there 's no answer from Crais . Nor is Moya getting any answer from Talyn . What happened to you ? Aeryn , what can you see ? He 's been hit hard . Pilot , any other ships in the area ? Not that I can tell . Crais ? Crais . We have ... we have to give him the death rites . Yeah . - We have to give him ... I 'm sure there 's a bunch of Oricans around here . Damn it ! We should 've stuck together . I wanted us to stick together but he ... we ... both of us , were too damned stubborn . - No , no , no , it 's not your fault . Chiana , D 'Argo is dead . Jool 's God knows where , and we have been here before . No , we haven 't ... They 're eating the ship . This is a Leviathan . It 's like Moya . It 's alive . We have to get out of here . We have to ... we have to get out of here . Yes , we do . Okay , okay . I can do this . I can , I can do anything . That 's what my father told me . That 's what my mother told me . And I 've never doubted them before ... Maybe once or twice . But I shouldn 't doubt them . I should believe in them . And I should ... believe in myself ! Oh , I don 't think this is right . I shouldn 't be here . I 'm a civilized being . There 's got to be someone here who recognizes that . I just need to find them . Hello ? Hello ? Pilot ? He 's disarmed . Yeah . All right , Pilot . Nariam coils , where are they ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , I get it . I ... I , you know , I get it . I come forward , you scream . I move back et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . Pilot , I 'm over . You 're gonna help me . You 're gonna give me something and you 're going to give it to me now ! Talk to me . Slowly . This ... ship ... Rovhu ... was ... was ... Slowly . Detention ship ... prison ship . Ship for ... for the ... krishool . What the hell is that ? The criminally insane . The criminally insane . We fix the Transport Pod , we get outta here . We got threekay wire . It 's a start at least . He controls the whole ship , Chiana ! He 's got the Maintenance Bay , he 's got the doors , he 's got the windows , he 's got the smoke on the water . I don 't know what you 're talking about . The guy ! Whatever , whoever . The one that killed D 'Argo . Doctor Spike . Kaarvok . Kaarvok . Spike . Kaarvok . That 's his name ? Bring Kaarvok . Ah , bring him back . What 's a PK prison convoy doing way out here in the Uncharted Territories ? Peacekeeper convoy ... Ambushed convoy . Scarrans ambushed . We drifting . Ah , not to Starburst ... not to go . Nowhere to go ... No one helps . We ... starve . What 's the big fuss ? Why the red carpet treatment ? His power ... And the others . The other prisoners . What 's their deal ? There were no other prisoners . Chiana ? Chiana . They 'll never get to him now . Never , ever . They had a whole prison ship for one prisoner ? What about all this other vermin we 're seeing ? The hungry , hungry hippies ? Peacekeepers . Peacekeepers ? They were Peacekeepers , all of them . Whoa ! Pilot ! He 's venting the chamber ! I wish you wouldn 't talk about me behind my back . No ... No ! No ! No ! Help ! No ! Frell ! Frell . Help me . Help me ! No , you are not taking him back to Moya . He is still alive , Rygel . We can fix that . What are you ... Give me the transponder . The ship is shutting down . Give it back . Rygel . Now ! Oh , that 's what we 're hoping for . Look , if you want to have it out with Moya , you can go right ahead . Listen , you bartantic bitch . Talyn 's supposedly the meanest , deadliest , all-time yave-of-the-yuvo fighter ship . But somebody , something , beat the yotz out of him . And when they come back to finish him off , we 'll be here with him , unarmed . And if we can keep him alive , we might find out what happened . Oh , in another arn or two it won 't matter . Let 's go . While we still can . Chiana ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Let her go ! Chiana ! Okay , okay . Come ... come ... Okay , okay . Two Chianas . Two ... She ... she ... and I 'm me . Yeah . I 'm me . Mm-mm . She ... she ... she was just a clone . A clone , so I 'm ... I 'm the real me . I 'm the real me . D 'Argo 's dead . Chiana 's dead . Oh , yeah . Oh yeah , I can feel it . That sick Hammer Horror son of a bitch , he 's going to be sucking my brains through a sippy straw , and it ain 't making me feel comfortable ! Now see I head for the Transport Pod and he runs me down like a sick lizard or ... we take back control . No . - We patch your ass back in . No . - We vent the chambers You can 't . - and suck his ass out into space . No , no , no . - Pilot , Pilot , Pilot . You listen to me . We can do this . We find Jool , we take back control . You and me , buddy . Good things are gonna happen . Good things . Are you comfortable in there ? Oh , do settle . You 're being very angry . What have you done to me ? D 'Argo , I saved you from the Xarai . You know , they 're completely uncivilized . What have you done with Chiana ? Chiana ? The Nebari ! The gray girl . Yes . Very , very , very , very nice . Really , very nice . Were you close ? What have you done with her ? I haven 't done anything . Last I heard she was having her best bits eaten by the Xarai . As I said , they 're uncivilized . It 's you I 'm more concerned about . What have you done with me ? I saw ... Yes ? You saw ? What did you see ? Another D 'Argo ? You cloned me . Not the word clone , please . I doubled you . I ... twinned you . Two D 'Argos , equal and original . And tasty . I 've never twinned a Luxan before . Why me ? We 're going to make babies . Chiana in two . Two ... two of me ? Two . Forked ! He copies you . That 's what he does . Two Chianas . Think . Think . Kaarvok must 've found a way to patch himself into Rovhu . Forced Control System . Installed security of the Peacekeepers . Yeah , but she 's still alive . Not conscious life . Tertiary life support . You feel that ? Its ... uh ... Crichton . Can 't work the console . I 'm coming up . I can double you again . And again and again . Look at the Peacekeepers . What Peacekeepers ? All over the ship . The Xarai , I call them . Private joke . I once had a tame vangern called Xarai . As you can see , once you 've been twinned 30 or 40 times , you 're not much good for conversation . Not that you 're especially witty right now . Hold still ! I can help you get off this ship . Why should I want to do that ? Because this ship is dying . It 's rotting to pieces all around you . This is my home . All I need is more ... what , food ? Family ? Is there a difference ? D 'Argo , you know how painful it is . I 'm willing to spare you the pain of a whole half cycle , as long as you breed for me . Breed ? With what ? D 'Argo , meet Belima . I 'm sorry , I ... I think I twinned her a little too often . Rovhu has no power enough . Takes time to charge . Still nothing . No , can 't even ... lights ... no use . Pilot , don 't give up here . You 're all I 've got , you understand that ? I need you , big boy , and you need me . Come on . Central pluxus cable . Central ... pluxus cable . Crichton ! No ! - Quite simple , Rygel . - I 'm taking the Pod and collecting the others . Take plenty of food with you . There 'll be nothing here when you return . I 'll be back within the arn . You 're leaving us chained to Talyn ? Crawling along at hetch three . Towing him is the only way . Boll-yotz . We should be Starbursting . We can 't Starburst . You know we can 't . We can . If you try anything when I am gone , whatever you have in the place of mivonks and wherever they are , they will be gone when I get back . We give her 300 microts . Then we cut ourselves free from Talyn and we Starburst . Talyn will recover . Crais may not . I suspect that now is not the right moment to abscond . Come on , dammit , John . Remember the sequence . You know the sequence . Remember the damn sequence . You know what you 're doing here . Come on . Hey , Kaarvok ! It 's just you and me now ! What do you say we meet for some coffee or something ? I 'm sure we 've got lots of stuff we could talk about . We 'll cook you up something special , K-man . It 's gonna take a little while . We 're gonna hit you with some Starburst Supreme ! D 'Argo ! Ah ... Um ... Help me . Oh . Oh . Um ... Are you sure I 'm ... not interrupting something ? Chiana , just hurry up . Ohh ! Okay . Because you know , I ... I could just leave you there if ... if you want . It 's ... it 's no trouble . No , no , no , hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry . Oh ... Narium coils . I 'm coming . Okay . Thank you . Uh-uh-uh-uh . Chains . That 's where I was aiming . Where 's Crichton ? I dunno . We got separated . Maintenance Bay 's this way . Where did you get separated ? D 'Argo , we got the stuff we need , okay ? We got threekay , we-we-we got narium ... Pilot 's Den . Come on , this way . No , I 'll go search for him . You go back . No way . I 'm not gonna split up . Chiana , go and get the Transport Pod ready . Give me a quarter of an arn and I 'll meet you there . Kaarvy ! What 's that I hear ? Is that ... Starburst ? We can 't Starburst . We 're in a control collar . Oh , yes , we can Starburst . Just means this whole ship is toast . Schmick light show , baby . You want to try that again ? Bring it on . Okay . This is the best way . 'Cause it 's going to be quick . And it 's gonna hurt a lot less than being eaten . Still haven 't learned how to use it . I nearly shot myself with a pulse rifle ! What the frell ? This ship won 't Starburst . It 's not strong enough . Maybe she just needs to recharge . I don 't think so , brain sucker . I can arrange my own death . Hurry up , Chiana . I 'm going as fast as I can . Hurry ! John ! What the hell are you still doing here , Kaarvey ? Others will come . More and more of you will come . To me , my family , my farmland ... my ... my perfect ... perfect dish . Crichton ! D 'Argo . Hey , kids ! It 's dinnertime . And it 's finger lickin ' good ! John ! John , can you hear me ? John ! D 'Argo ! Are you okay ? Yeah , we 'll talk about it later . Come on ! Jool , you 're alive ! Well hurry up ! Chiana , let 's go ! Chiana ! Hold the door ! Jool , you 're alive ! Come on . Come on , you piece of junk . It was over in a flash . No more than a tenth of a microt . But I saw it . I saw ... myself . Another me . Do you remember the actual moment ? No , I don 't remember anything except ... it was a corpse . It was just a copy . A fake . I keep telling myself that , but then this Crichton , and Kaarvok , he said he 'd created two equal and original . Boll-yotz ! Kaarvok was full of it . Then how do you know that I am not the copy ? Maybe the real D 'Argo is dead . Because you just know ! You know . Frell . How is ... he ? Still tied . I doubled you . I twinned you . Equal and original .

Scorpius . - Just do not tell me that he has escaped ! - He has . And there 's a Command Carrier on the way . - D 'Argo , how the hell did that happen ? - We 're still working on that . We 've got lots of bugs in Moya 's systems . Oh , great . Well , what does Sikozu say about that ? Haven 't heard from her since the escape . But Pilot 's losing control of critical systems . Right , right , right . We will be there ASAP . Chiana , damn it , wake up ! All right ... all right . How the hell ... does this thing come off ? Where 's Chiana ? Ah , she 's too boney . Probably tastes like fish . You don 't want to eat her . - The bloody bitch bites . - What am I , chopped liver ? ! I do not have time for this . How come nobody ever wants to eat me ? ! - In here . - Where ? In here ! Back so soon ? And I thought you didn 't like us . Where 's Chiana ? Could you be more ... specific ? Little gray girl ... a sword , and a fluffy hat . Girl of gray with swords of play . Girl of gray went that-a-way . Wait for it ... Mind the gap . eenie , meenie , minie - Floor please . - Me ! Where the gray girl went . Oh-oh-oh-oh . The Penthouse . Mm . Do you have an appointment ? You know , this 'd be vaguely amusing if I wasn 't in a hurry . It 's your funeral . So-so-so-so , what-what brings you here ? Business ? Pleasure ? That 's a nice sword you 've got . Ever slay any dragons with it ? You should give it a name . How about ... Cameron or ... Uma-Uma-Uma ? First floor-first floor . Little lost girls . Have a good day . Yes , I know . This elevator sucks . My job suck-suck-sucks . Day-after-day , the same-same thing . Up-down-up-down , down . Just once-just once it 'd be nice to go sideways ... just-just ... sideways . Frog Princess . Not-not that I plan on doing this forever-ever . I have plans you know . Big plans . I-I 'm studying to be an Astronaut . And ... Penthouse . Have a good day . I knew it ! I knew it had to be you ! Ma 'am ! A visitor . Yes , I can see that . I 'm so sorry , Ma 'am . I didn 't realize you expected other guests . That 's all right , Harvey . Would you let the master know that we have a gentlemen caller ? - He 's not the ... ogre ? - What ... Harvey ? Oh , heavens no ... he 's just an incorrigible liar and the butler . So , can I help you find some place to ... sheath that sword ? - No ... where 's , uh ... - The grey girl ? Don 't you worry about her . My beast of a boyfriend is ... showing ' her around the place . - Can I get you a drink ? - No ... Oh , don 't be like that . You must be parched from comin ' all this way . I only want ... Chiana . Oh , no ... We both know that 's not true . Honey ! We 're out of ice . Steady on there , meat . We just finished redecorating after the last blood bath we had in here . It 's a little ... joke ! So ... you here to ... kiss the missus ? Why do you have to be such a monster ? At least I don 't spend my days redecorating . What is it with women and change ? ! Seems like nothing is ever good enough . - Oh ... you have to save me from him ... you have to save me . - Chiana ! - Hey ! - What the hell have you been doing ? ! - We have a problem on the ship , we have to go ! - Okay ! See ! Every time we meet someone nice ... you scare them away ! - Something wrong ? - You scare them away ! Of course , as usual ! Now let 's go ! D ... rally the troops , we 're comin ' in . - What took you so long ? - Weird detour . Pilot 's blind on the hamman side , tier seven and eleven . DRDs are searching there . It 's likely Scorpius is hiding in those blind spots . The plan is ... we hunt him down . I like that plan . Aeryn and John , you take tier seven . And Rygel , stay where you are and stay out of trouble ! This is familiar ? What , the passageway ? No . It 's good to have you back . John ! - Crichton ! Aeryn ! He 's here ! - On our way , Pilot . Seal the chamber . Locked out . D 'Argo ? - Pilot ? - Pip ? Crichton ... I can 't find D 'Argo . Access shaft . This way . Feels like a trap . Only one way to know . Pilot ? You all right ? Everything is finally under control . - Pilot ? - Not exactly , Commander . Have you ever heard of a neural harness ? Your Pilot 's mind ... is now slave to my own . John . Whatever happens to the master ... happens to the slave . If I die ... so does your Pilot . Grayza 's Command Carrier is on the way . He 's a pathological liar ... our odds ... are not gonna get any better . Feeling lucky ? Aeryn . He 's awake . He did it , didn 't he ? Tagged you with a microchip . You haven 't considered the possibility that I was protecting Pilot . The second boot to the head convinced me otherwise . She 's special , don 't you think ? You son-of-a-bitch . Shall we end this ? You resisted the Aurora Chair . You 've resisted my Neural Clone , and ah ... you resist all reason . - You 're starting to sound like Sikozu . - Perhaps . Where does that leave us , John ? Time you headed off for darker pastures ... and left me the hell alone . You resist because you have hope . Hope that your friends will save you . This time it will be different . One by one I will extinguish all your hopes ... and little by little you will begin to see reason . Scorpius ... - We have Rygel . - Lovely girl . I hear that one-quarter Scarran-Sebacean offspring are quite handsome . You harm me you harm her . Psst . Hey ... Crichton ... Down here . I 've got the game . Chiana ... Shh ... they 're sleeping . Okay ? I don 't want to have to deal with them now . Okay , Scorpius ... has got control of the whole of the ship . He 's got D 'Argo and Rygel ... everybody . He can hear ... everything . - Not in here . - Right . We can 't kill the son-of-a-bitch without hurting ' the others . Whatever happens to him , happens to everybody he controls . So leave me the game blob thingee . When I take him down , you have to find a way to hog-tie everybody . So you 're gonna draw Scorpius into the game . What are you doing ? Working on what your master wants . So you still think that he controls me . Does he ? Look , the only thing that keeps you alive is the secret you hold . And the same is true for me . He 's hearing all this you know . I know . I should never have let you go . Most of this floor you should recognize . It 's an equation describing the behavior of wormholes . What it lacks ... is the single unifying symbol . That symbol ... is beneath my left foot . Would you like to see it ? You would give it to me ? I want you to take it . Your species ... has brutal flair . Anyone else enters this room ... I can spill enough blood to erase the entire equation . Very well . You know if you kill me ... Oh ... I don 't think that 's gonna happen , not after all you 've survived . Then again ... I could get lucky . - Ah , crap ... I wasn 't su ... - Quick , this way ! He 's not supposed to come ... from that direction . Really , John ... you expect to hold me in a simulation ? - Seemed like a good idea at the time . - This world means nothing to me . - I see through its very existence . - John ! Allow me to show you what I see . Having trouble breathing ? I wonder if you die now ... whether your mind will carry the wormhole knowledge with it into the game . Relax John . Soon it will be over . He was killing you . I couldn 't let that happen . We have to get out of here before he comes out . Come on . - What about the others ? - We can 't save the others . Listen ... John ... I came back for you . Nothing else matters . I just want to be with you . Now let 's get out of here before it 's too late . Something 's wrong . Something 's wrong . Does this mean it 's over ? - Chiana ! - What 's wrong ? Everything . We 're still in the game . We never left . Moya is part ... of the game . They changed the doors . Figured it out , have we ? Stark ! What the hell is this about ? This ... is all about you ... John Crichton . You 're far too sick ... to be allowed to run free in the universe . When you die on the outside ... your mind will live on ... here ... with us . Welcome home , John . - How the hell do we get out of this game ? - I don 't know . - Then this better work . - Okay . Careful , it 's your last one . What the hell 's the endgame ? One hero 's sword to set her free-free-free . One kiss upon her lips , so sweet . Thus ends your quest . Thus ends the game-game . And thus your soul is saved . - We already heard that . - Yeah , I know that , but finding a door out may be impossible . If we die , it only resets the level . One sure way out , we achieve the end game . We 're gonna kiss the Princess . Run-run-run , as fast as you can , like a budong ... No , no , not in the face ! Bastard wants us to play , let 's give him what he wants . That hurt , John . Stark ... . So , how 'd you do it ? Who helped ? You did ... you and that tragic brother . - Pouring his heart out on his deathbed . - Bull . This game has crap he couldn 't know . It 's crap you gave me along the way . You talk so much . Oh , God ... no Sikozu , no Noranti ... Very good ! Damn , I guess that leaves one question . Plants ... why do they love the light ? Oh ... John ! Oh ! None shall pass ! Where is he ? What are they doing here ? It 's my turn ! You are disturbing ... my meal . - Chiana ... - Yeah ? This room seems too easy . What do you mean ? I mean , first time here , how did you make it through ? - Chiana , what 's Aeryn 's secret ? - What ? Aeryn 's secret . Why about me ? ! Hey ... Eat this ! Aeryn 's pregnant . Frell , Crichton ! You left me there for arns ! I could 'a died ! Sorry about that . What is it with women and change ? You-you-you really are John C-Crichton . Can I get an autograph ? Master ... We have guests . - I 'm here for the princess . - I can see that . So romantic . You up for this ? Could be fun . Let 's screw the pooch . I 'm all about fun . Game on . I learned this on ... TV ! I 'm not gonna clean up ! Oh ! Come on , Harvey . Stop fighting ' like a girl . You need more practice , meat . I 'll make a note . Oh , girl , I can see who wears the pants in your family ! Redecoratin ' , blood everywhere ... She just killed you . Honey , the butler 's dead . - Hey , Pip ! - Yeah ? A little help ? That 's it , finish him off . Two against one ! Looks like I won 't be having that drink after all ! He 's mine ! How 'm I doin ' ? - I 'm comin ' back for you . - I hope so . Oh , child ! Well , she done it now . Women ! Go on . - Are you really John Crichton ? - Yeah ... We are gonna be so happy together . Chiana ? - I don 't know . - What do you mean , you don 't know ? - I don 't ... know ! Hey ! I know . Maybe you have to do more than just kiss her . Maybe " kiss " is a metaphor for showing her a really good time . Yeah , and maybe Chiana has to kiss her . Huh ? Can I watch ? I love to watch . She ... is not the Princess . What ? Well , I 'm not the princess you seek . But we could still have a really good time . This is my world , meat . You 're just walking through it for a very long time . When your body is dead , your mind will live here with us to strut and fret forever you poor player . Crichton ? Game reset . What are you doing , John ? D-d-doing John ? Your world , your Princess . Princess-princess-pr-princess . One-one pr-princess fair , her br-broken heart by ug-ugliness enslaved-ug-ugliness-ugliness enslaved . Ugliness enslaved . John , we can work this out . One hero 's sword ... to set her free . Don 't touch her ! She 's mine ! Mine ! Be silent , Stark . Is that really you , John Crichton ? I think ... yeah . And you 're ... ? Zhaan . For all that matters . This Stark wishes to keep you here . He blames you . No ! Believes I died for the love of you . A lot of people have died because of me . What is it that you wish of me , John Crichton ? A kiss ? Have you wasted my death ... and the deaths of so many others ? I don 't know . Then I suggest you find out , before anyone else dies for the love of you . No . Son-of-a-bitch . D ! D 'Argo . - John , where are you ? - Ah ... I 'm not entirely sure right now . - What 's up with Scorpius ? - A small problem with his door ... but that 's already sorted . You 're long overdue . Is everything okay ? Hey , hey . We 're not dead . How drad is that ! Interesting day ? They 're all interesting . This was more like ... confusing . And a warrior needs clarity . - I 'm not a warrior . - You carry a weapon . Second amendment . Besides it 's Scorpy 's war , not mine . Thousands dead . Billions in the balance . But that 's not the war I 'm speaking of . Aeryn . The war of the heart . Always Aeryn . Yeah , I don 't ... think too clear where Aeryn is concerned . Pain clouds judgement . Distillate of Laka . One whiff ... and the pain is gone for a time . It 'll help you forget about Aeryn . Oh and please , don 't thank me . It 's been one hundred and fifty cycles since I 've since I 've felt for someone the way you do for her . I hear I was a Princess ... Subtitles : PK SUB-66

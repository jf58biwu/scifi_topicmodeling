 Anson ? Anson ? Where are you , Anson ? Anson . Come back , Anson . Anson . Calling Anson . Where are you , Anson ? Anson . Anson . Calling Anson . Where are you , Anson ? Anson . Where are you , Anson ? Anson . Get out here . I 've warned you about your attitude . Did you clean out 407 ? No , of course you haven 't cleaned out 407 . You 've only had all damn morning . You think you 'll ever own any of those boats , the way you 're going ? You think you 're ever going to amount to anything ? You can 't even finish a simple job . - A monkey could do this job , all right , Jay ? - You can 't , so what 's that say about you ? - Shut up . - Excuse me ? I didn 't catch that . You clean out 407 , you move out that deadbeat 's stuff , and you do it now . And when I come back in an hour , it better be done . Anson ? Anson ? Son of a ... Anson . Anson . That 's it , Anson . Do you hear me , Ans ... ? Can I get you some coffee ? Water ? Anything ? Morning . Morning . Special Agent Dana Scully , this is Jay Gilmore . - Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet ... Likewise . Mr Gilmore came all the way to see us from Missouri , the Show Me State . They told me you were the people to best understand my sit ... - My sit ... - lt 's OK . This is Mr Gilmore 's situation . This condition came on suddenly a month ago . Anson Stokes . He did this to me . I don 't know how. I just ... I know it was him . Anson Stokes is a former employee at the self-storage yard that Mr Gilmore owns . - There was bad blood between you two . - He told me to shut up . Yeah . And then Mr Gilmore was stricken ... stricken ... stricken , and Anson Stokes was nowhere to be found . He resurfaced days later . The police wanted to question him , but he refused . Do you know what he said ? He said they had nothing on him . Well , to be fair , sir , they didn 't . They don 't . They had to make me a whole new mouth . Do you think Blue Cross is going to pay for this ? I demand justice . - All I 'm saying is ... - l know . This may not be a crime , and Stokes may know nothing about it . There is a condition called microstomia - " small mouth " - which is ... lt 's brought on by scleroderma . It 's the overproduction of collagen . It can actually reduce a person 's mouth to a tiny little opening . But that takes months to develop . It doesn 't happen in the blink of an eye . Surgeons are stumped . They 're writing it up in the New England Journal of Medicine . There 's always nasal aplasia - the absence of a nose . That 's a nose . We 're talking mouth here . What we 're talking is medical , physiological , not criminal . Not as far as I can see . Maybe , but I still wanna know why Anson Stokes doesn 't wanna talk to the police . Mulder ... That 's a little out of place , wouldn 't you say ? A little bit . Dammit . Leslie . What ? What is it ? lRS agents . Gotta be . Listen , get rid of ' em , all right ? Hi . - We 're looking for a Mr Anson Stokes . - He 's not here . Do you happen to know when he 's coming back ? Well , we are Agents Mulder and Scully from the fbi . The boat 's not ours . The boat ... I 'm just ... We 're holdin ' it for someone , and , you know , they pay the taxes on it . OK ... - Anson 's not here . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - What 's your name ? - Leslie Stokes . You 're Anson 's brother ? Hi , there . We 're not here about the boat . We wanna talk to your brother about his former employer . Mr Gilmore . And the unfortunate condition that he 's found himself in . - Would you know anything about that ? - The mouth thing ? Well , yeah . You know , that 's just ... that 's , like ... chemicals . Chemicals ? Yeah , you know , people store weird chemicals . My brother one time smelled this weird smell . It was just a guy with a meth lab . In one of the storage units . That 's probably something you should look into . You know , I 'm gonna get going . So I 'm gonna go , OK ? OK . Now I see what 's going on here . According to Gilmore , he was standing right where l am when it happened . Well , I don 't smell any weird chemical smells . You still have both your lips . Apparently , everything is left as it was . 1978. lt 's been a long time since any of this stuff has seen the light of day . It 's too bad , Mulder . Underneath all this dust , this furniture is really wonderful . You wanna hit some yard sales while we 're out here ? Mulder , this furniture is expensive . Very expensive . - What 's your point ? - My point is that there 's a lot of money sitting here and maybe something 's missing . - Like what ? - l don 't know . Jewelry ? Stokes opened up the storage unit , then disappeared . Winds up with the Titanic in his driveway ? There 's your crime - theft . Still doesn 't explain what happened to Gilmore . Scully , check this out . This woman look familiar to you ? - That 's the woman from the trailer . - That 's the young woman from the trailer . How many centuries now has disco been dead ? Two down . Two down , I got nothin ' to show for it . - You got the boat . - And what the hell good is that ? That thing is like a big ... you know , big ... - White elephant ? - What ? I 'm sorry . What does that mean ? It 's an expensive item that serves no purpose and is ultimately more trouble than it 's worth . - So what the hell did you give it to me for ? - Because you asked for it . Fine. I can appreciate that . That 's ... But don 't you think maybe you could 've found some freakin ' water to put it in ? - You didn 't specify water . - l gotta specify that you put a boat in water ? That is a given . Freakin ' white elephant . I can 't even pay the taxes on it . Why don 't you just use your last wish to get rid of it ? You want me to put you in a home ? Now ? Because I just told you , Leslie , that I wasted two wishes , OK ? And I am not ... Are you listening ? I am not gonna waste the third . All right ? Come on . God . We gotta concentrate here . Now , let me figure this out . Third wish . Final wish . I 'm just spitballing ' here . If I say " l wish " by accident , that does not count , not until I am absolutely ready , OK ? - You could give that guy his mouth back . - All I said was I wish Jay would shut up . If you feel bad about what you did to him , fix it on your own dime , OK ? - lt doesn 't work like that . - Whatever . Leslie , would you help me out here ? - Money . Wish for money . - Yeah . OK , that 's not bad . But shouldn 't we think of something that generates money , instead of money itself ? Brains ? Talent ? Hard work ? - A money machine . - OK . That 's not ... But somethin ' better . Somethin ' better . OK , but ... I just ... - An infinite number of wishes ? - OK . Just three , boys . Settle down . Dammit , this is hard . You know , I have a thought . - Granted , it 's pretty obvious . - What ? What , what , what , what , what ? - What ? - What ? Seriously . What ? Forget it . - l got it . - Yeah ? I got it. I got it , I got it , I got it . Are you ready ? Because I am ready . I am absolutely ready . OK , here goes . I wish that I could turn invisible . At will . - You 're kidding . - No , no . This is perfect . I can have an advantage that nobody else can have . I can , you know , spy and learn secret information , pick up stock tips . - Sneak into a women 's locker room . - Notjust that . I 'm talkin ' about James Bond type stuff . You know ? Your wish is breathtaking in its unoriginality . You don 't have to like it , all right ? You just have to do it . Right ? Done . My clothes are gonna turn invisible , too , right ? - You didn 't specify clothes . - l know , but ... Screw it . Oh , God . Turn invisible , please . Yes . Whoa , man , this is awesome . Brother . Leslie ? I 'm over here . I 'm over here . Can you see me ? Dammit . - Anson , are you all right ? - Yeah , yeah . I can 't see my damn feet . Look out , world . Here I come . I 'm invisible. invisible , baby . Yes . You can 't see me , can you ? I ... Yeah . Outta my way , birds . Yeah . Well , hello , ladies . Yeah , here comes Anson . That 's right . Come on . Come on , come on , come on . Change , change . All right , here we go . Need a little roadside assistance , do ya ? Well , not to worry . Here comes Anson . Can we go now ? I think you missed a spot here . I can see straight through to his ass . This is Anson Stokes , huh ? It is . His dental records are a match . He was found about half a mile from his house . He was probably hit by a car or a truck or something . And he 's invisible . Yes , he is . Wow . In the seven years that we 've worked together I have seen some amazing things , but this ... This takes the cake. lt 's gonna change the boundaries of science . It is amazing , but I don 't think it has anything to do with science . - Remember Mr Saturday Night Fever ? - Yeah . I did a little background checking . His real name is Henry Flanken . He redefined the term " overnight success . " ln 1977 , his net worth was $ 36,000 , and in 1978 it was $ 30 million . Then there is the interesting way in which Mr Flanken died . - How 's that ? - Chronic morbid tumescence . - You don 't mean what I think you mean ? - Schwing . On April 4 , 1978 , he was admitted to Gateway Memorial Hospital with an extreme priapic condition . He was quite the specimen . They had to raise the doorframe in order to wheel him in . Well , what does any of that have to do with this ? Well , I think our mystery woman is the link . About whom I can find no information whatsoever . I think she 's responsible for all of this . - But how ? - l don 't know . But we need to talk to her . I think that I should stay here with the body. I mean , I ... You know ... I don 't think it 's a good idea to leave him unguarded . You know , this is truly amazing . OK . I 'm very sorry for your loss . Anson didn 't suffer , did he ? No , I don 't think he suffered . But the part about him being invisible , that doesn 't catch you off guard just a little bit ? There was a woman here earlier . Where is she ? She 's gone . I 'll tell you where l 'm going with this . I think that woman is ajinniyah . - Are you familiar with that term ? - No . It 's the feminine forjinni - as in a demon or spirit from Middle Eastern folklore . Yeah , except Barbara Eden never killed anybody . All right . Now , in Arabic mythology they speak of these beings that are composed of flame or air but take human form . They can perform certain tasks or grant certain wishes . They live in inanimate objects like a lamp or a ring. ls this beginning to sound familiar ? I believe your brother found just such an object in the storage facility , didn 't he ? He took possession of the jinniyah , and he made some pretty outrageous requests . - Like Jay Gilmore 's mouth and the yacht . - Wait , wait . - You believe all that ? - l do . For your own safety - so that what happened to your brother doesn 't happen to you - l think you should hand over that object to me right now . You 're doing the right thing . Scully , come check this out . Come on . He 's not going anywhere . Come on . Bye . I have a group of researchers flying in from Harvard Medical . Can 't wait to see their faces . - What 's this ? - Not what I hoped it would be . Judging from the odor inside , I think it 's where the Stokes brothers keep their weed . But that 's not what I wanted to show you . - Recognize him ? - Benito Mussolini . How about her ? Your mystery woman . Or someone who looks a lot like her . Well , the computer says it is her . I ran her through facial-recognition software . Couldn 't find a match in the felon database . Then I took a flier and checked with the image bank at the national archives . Voilà . Even if it is her , what would she be doing with Mussolini ? Or Richard Nixon , for that matter . I don 't know . Except that they 're both men who got all the power they ever wished for and then lost it . See ? I told you it 'd look good in here . Nice rug . How do you breathe in that thing , huh ? Can we just get this over with ? Three wishes . OK . Don 't rush me , all right ? I wanna do this right . Gotta be smarter than Anson was . Dammit , Anson . Then , can I once again offer you a suggestion ? What ? This . Your disability . There was some tragedy involved here , I assume . Well , yeah , it was pretty tragic , I guess . Me and Anson were playing mailbox baseball . God , I miss that . And Anson 's drivin ' . I was leanin ' pretty far out the window there . You mean this ? Yeah , you 're right. I could wish for a solid-gold wheelchair . Man , that 'd be sweet . I see what you 're sayin ' , but you know what ? There 's somethin ' l want more than that . You 're not gonna believe your eyes . I certainly didn 't . Are you ready ? He 's ... He is invisible , after all . He 's in there . OK . He 's creepin ' me out . This isn 't what I asked for . He 's all weird and messed up . He 's been hit by a truck . What did you expect ? - l asked you to bring him back to normal . - You asked me to bring him back . OK , you know , the ... Now he 's startin ' to smell bad . This isn 't what I wanted . Look , he 's gotta at least be able to talk . OK , you know what ? That 's my next wish . Wish number two - l wish Anson could talk . - No , you don 't . - Yes , I do , and that 's final . I wish Anson could talk . Done . I should just shoot myself . I was so happy . I was so excited . What was I thinking ? An invisible man ? You saw it. lt was real . I don 't know what I saw , Mulder . I do know that having that kind of proof in my hands , it was just too good to be true . - l don 't think it 's why the body disappeared . - Why did the body disappear ? I think it was the result of a wish being granted . A wish ? - Whose wish ? - Who would want Anson Stokes back ? I mean , really , really back . His brother , Leslie ? Well , this is no good . What did you do to me ? You 're back from the dead , man . What kinda gratitude is that ? What did you do to me ? I wasted two wishes on you , that 's what I did . I can 't feel my heart . I can 't feel my blood . I am yellow . I 'm cold . - You know what ? Screw this . - l 'm cold . - l 'm cold . - l wasted two wishes on you . And a perfectly good bowl of cornflakes . There. I turned the heat up . Are you happy now ? Are you happy ? is there anything else I can do for you , there , buddy ? What do you say ? Maybe wipe your little yellow butt ? - Thanks for nothin ' . - You wanna make your third wish , champ ? I 'd like to leave before the blowflies hatch . Yeah , I tell you what , my last wish is gonna be for me , OK ? You hear that , Anson ? I wasted two wishes on you and you don 't even give a damn . All right . Third wish . Let 's see , I could wish for ... I could wish for money . Everybody wishes for money . So cold . There 's the invisibility thing . That turned out pretty stupid , though , huh ? Anson ? To be invisible ? That was real smart , huh ? X-ray eyes , maybe ? No , that 'd be ... Like you said , solid-gold wheelchair . Wait , I got it . Legs . Would you mind removing your eyewear , ma 'am ? - Do you have a name ? - Not for a long time now . How about if I call you Jen ? That 's short for " jinniyah . " The fire department just recovered two bodies . - Leslie Stokes and his brother Anson . - Looks like it . And Anson Stokes is visible now . Of course . But what I 'd really love an explanation for is how his corpse got from my locked morgue all the way across town to the Mark Twain Trailer Park . Ask him . He 's got it all figured out . I know what he 'd say . He 'd say you 're some kind of genie from 1001 Nights or something , - and that you grant people wishes . - Well , there you have it . One thing I haven 't been able to figure out is whether you 're a good genie or an evil one . Everybody you come in contact with seems to meet a bad end . That 's the conclusion you 've drawn ? That I 'm evil ? Well , possibly evil . Possibly cursed . A curse to others . The only thing you people are cursed with is stupidity . All of you . Everybody . Mankind . Everyone I have ever come into contact with . Without fail . - Always asking for the wrong thing . - Making the wrong wishes ? Yeah. lt 's always " Give me money . " " Give me big boobs . " " Give me a big hoo-hoo . " " Make me cool , like the Fonz . " Or whoever 's the big name now . - You 've been out of circulation a long time . - So what ? In 500 years , people have not changed a bit . 500 years ? Granted , they smell better now , generally speaking . But human greed still reigns . Shallowness . A propensity for self-destruction . You 're saying that you have been a first-hand witness to 500 years of human history . I used to be human . I was born in 15th-century France , and then one day an old Moor came to my village peddling rugs , and I unrolled one that an ifrit had taken residence in . - " An ifrit . " - A very powerful class of genie . He offered me three wishes . For the first I asked for a stouthearted mule . For the second , a magic sack that was always full of turnips ... Did I mention this was 15th-century France ? - What was your third wish ? - My third , I pondered for a great while . I didn 't want to waste it . So , finally , feeling very intelligent , I spoke up and I said " Je souhaite un grand pouvoir et une longue vie . " " l wish for great power and long life . " - And thus became a genie yourself . - Gave me the mark of the jinn , right there . It 's forever . Sorta like a prison tattoo . I should 've been more specific . So , am I under arrest ? I can 't think of anything we have to hold you on . And , not surprisingly , we don 't have any evidence of any of this , so I think she 's free to go . No , I 'm not . He unrolled me . I get three wishes . So , your partner left the airport rather quickly . And I don 't think she likes me very much . I don 't think she knows what to make of you . I don 't think I do either , really . Well , you could always give up your three wishes. I 'll disappear , no hard feelings . I didn 't think so . So what 's your first wish ? Well ... What would your wish be , if you were in my place ? - l 'm not you. lt doesn 't matter . - But I just ... You know , I 'd like to know . I 'd wish that I 'd never heard the word " wish " before . I 'd wish that I could live my life moment by moment ... enjoying it for what it is instead of ... instead of worrying about what it isn 't . I 'd sit down somewhere with a great cup of coffee ... and I 'd watch the world go by . But then again , I 'm not you . So I doubt that 's your wish . I 'm beginning to see the problem . You say most people make the wrong wishes , right ? Without fail. lt 's like giving a chimpanzee a revolver . This is because they make their wishes for personal gain . Could be . So the trick would be to make a wish that 's totally altruistic , that 's for everyone . So ... I wish for peace on earth . Peace on earth ? That 's it ? - What 's wrong with that ? You can 't do it ? - No . I can . It 's done . Crap . I guess I should 've seen this coming . Scully . Scully ? Hello ? Hello ? Very good . Genie ? Jinni ? Whatever the hell your name is . Yes ? - What the hell is this ? - lt 's what you asked for . Peace on earth . Listen . You know damn well that 's not what I meant . - You didn 't specify . - This has nothing to do with specificity . You don 't have to wipe out the entire population of the whole planet just to effect peace on earth and goodwill towards men . You didn 't say goodwill towards men . So you expect me to change the hearts of six billion people ? No religion in history has been able to pull that off . Not Allah or Buddha or Christ . But you 'd like me to do that in your name ? So what ? - You can feel real good about yourself ? - Did I say that ? I didn 't say that . How grotesquely egotistical of you. I bet you wish you hadn 't made your first wish . Yes , I do , since you butchered the intent of that wish so completely . And another thing. I think you 've got a really horrible attitude . I guess it comes from being rolled up for the last 500 years . But we 're not all that stupid . We 're not all chimpanzees with revolvers . I think there 's another possibility here , and that 's just that you 're a bitch . Agent Mulder ? Sir . How did you get in here ? " l have one wish left and desire to use it effectively for the good of all mankind ... " " .. here on this plane of existence ... " - What , are you a lawyer ? - Well , I have to be with you . I 'm gonna get this perfect . I won 't leave you any loopholes . I 'm not gonna let you bring back the Third Reich or make people 's eyes grow on stalks . Oh , jeez . And I was so looking forward to that . Skinner called me , Mulder . is everything all right ? You don 't remember disappearing off the face of the earth for about an hour this morning ? No . Well , I guess everything 's OK . Mul ... - Could you give us a minute , please ? - Sure . Like , today ? Wh ... - Where the hell did she go ? - Boink . No ... lt 's gotta be hypnotism or mesmerism or something . Scully , it is what it is . You examined an invisible body , remember ? I thought I did . Mulder , all right , say that you 're right . Say this is what it is . Then what you 're doing is extraordinarily dangerous . - l mean , you even said that yourself . - No , no . The trick is to be specific . To make the wish perfect . That way , everyone will benefit. lt 'll be a safer , happier world . There 'll be food for everyone , freedom for everyone , the end of tyranny of the powerful over the weak . - Am I leaving anything out ? - lt sounds wonderful . Then what 's the problem ? Maybe it 's the whole point of our lives here , Mulder - to achieve that . Maybe it 's a process that one man shouldn 't try and circumvent with a single wish . You ready ? Yeah , I 'm ready . I can 't believe you don 't want butter on your popcorn. lt 's un-American . Caddyshack , Mulder ? It 's a classic American movie . That 's what every guy says. lt 's a guy movie . When you invite me over to your place we can watch Steel Magnolias . So ... what 's the occasion ? I don 't know , itjust felt like the thing to do . Cheers . Cheers . I don 't know if you noticed , but I never made the world a happier place . Well , I 'm fairly happy . That 's something . And now , our feature presentation . So what was your final wish , anyway ? Here you go . Visiontext Subtitles : Kerrie Slavin US english

 We saw the Earth destroyed . And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . Please state your full name . Fisher Newton , Junior . Mr Newton , explain to the jury exactly why you 're here today . I killed my parents . Speak up , please . I killed my mother and father . - You murdered your parents ? - Yes , sir . You didn 't just murder your parents , did you , Mr Newton ? - You chopped them up with an axe . - Yes , sir . And why would you do such an unbelievable thing ? They weren 't real . Repeat that , please . My mother and father were taken and replaced . Replaced by what ? Artificial versions of themselves . How could you tell that they were artificial ? A child knows its parents , Mr Sloan . Plus , when I cut them up ... they bled white soup . Did you say white soup ? That 's what it looked like to me . The police never found their bodies , did they ? No blood , no tissue , no DNA . Now , can you explain that ? They didn 't have any fucking DNA ... or blood or tissue . They weren 't fucking real . The defence attributed Newton 's delusions to Capgras Syndrome . Capgras Syndrome ? Say that five times real fast . Well , it 's very interesting . It 's a psychiatric condition ... whereby an individual becomes convinced ... that someone close to him has been replaced by duplicates . So they were going for insanity defence , yeah ? It didn 't fly . A jury convicted him in about a half an hour of first-degree murder . How 'd you get hold of that tape ? It was sent to the studio , care of Sarah Forbes , anonymously . Anonymously . Here we go again . Some other egghead about to jerk us off . There are people out there that know what we 're fighting against . Maybe they 're trying to help . Or maybe , to quote good old Chaucer ... they 're " the smiler with a knife under the cloak . " Well , in all deference to Chaucer , I wanna talk to this guy . Where is he ? - LDU number 7 . - LDU number 7 . Will one of you all start to speak the King 's English to me ? Lock Down Unit number 7 . It 's a privately operated , maximum security facility , about 20 miles outside of town . They 're owned and operated by Century Innovations . They 're a corporation that owns ... about a half dozen of these places across the country . Very , very tight-ass bunch . Yeah . I remember reading something about them . They had a couple of inmates who turned up dead ... a couple of months ago down in Florida . The press ripped them a new asshole . Which is exactly why they 're jumping at the chance ... to have a name reporter come in there with a camera crew ... and do a little spin control . Well , it 's all well and good except we got one major problem . What 's that ? Where in hell are we gonna find a name reporter ? Chuckie makes a jest . Just for that , you get to carry the heavy motherfucking camera . - Right on . Right on . Make the call . - I already made it . We have an appointment to tour the unit tomorrow morning . I 've secured passes for myself and two others . - Two others ? - Camera guy , sound guy . That 's it . - What about me ? - You stay at home . - Why ? - Well , I 'll gladly forfeit my spot on the tour . Yes , I 'm sure you gladly would . I 'll tell you why . Because , lest you forget , you 're in high school . If you don 't go to class in high school , they throw your ass out of high school . And they throw your ass out of high school , Son ... you don 't get to help us out of this bug mess ... by becoming a big-ass astronaut , which is what you are now . I thought I was in high school . - Don 't worry . I 'll tape it for you . - Thanks a lot . I feel sorry for our fifth crew member . Really . Poor Angela . Two months on the International Space Station ... in that orbiting tin can . Well , she wanted to get back up into space . Be careful what you wish for . Cheery structure . It 's a maximum-security prison , Kurt . What do you want ? Decorative planters ? Well , I never understand why ... places of incarceration have to be synonymous with bad architecture . Hey , Chuck , you better keep your cabin glasses on ... - until we 're sure nobody recognises you . - No problem . I kind of understand why the hipsters like this look . - I 'm getting a little attached to this hat . - Well , that makes one of us . I hope you didn 't have any trouble finding the place . - It 's a little hard to miss . - Unfortunately . So how long has the facility been around here ? Nearly four years . LDU-7 is the jewel in the crown of our new line of penitentiaries . Sounds like you 're talking about a luxury hotel . You got a room ? Hardly that . We process the most dangerous felons in the world . We 're not babysitters , that 's for sure . That 's quite a responsibility . A fact not always appreciated . That 's why we were so pleased to get the call ... from such a respected journalist as yourself . Thank you very much . I saw the piece you did on victims ' rights organisations . Truly inspiring . That 's why we knew you 'd be the right person for the job . Someone who 'd bring an unbiased objective approach ... to what we 're trying to accomplish . Is this the same thing you were trying to accomplish in your Florida facility ? I 'm sorry . I don 't believe we 've been introduced . People call me Buck . Just plain Buck . - Mr Buck . - No . Buck . - And you are ? - Roger . - Rogers . - Buck . - Rogers . - No . Roger . Singular . I have to admit the situation in Florida was unexpected and unacceptable . There 's an inherent danger in any facility such as this . I assure you , Century is providing a vital and valuable service to the country . It 's a message that needs to be conveyed to the American public in no uncertain terms . I 'm a news reporter , Mr Frazier . I just call it like I see it . I 'd expect nothing less from a professional such as yourself . Here 's your tour guide now . Let me introduce Norbert Manson . He 's the brains behind LDU-7 . This is Miss Forbes and her television crew . They 're here to scratch the surface of the unit . - Hi . - Hi . What 's up ? Well , I suppose this is where I should get off . If you have any further questions , Norbert 's more than qualified to answer them . He practically designed the place . Not exactly . He 's too modest . No one on the planet knows LDU-7 like Norbert . You 're in the best of hands . Now , if you 'll excuse me ... I 'm sure you 're anxious to get started with your tour . - Thank you very much . - Yeah . Thank you , man . This is Main Street . That 's what we call the main corridor that goes into the unit . Before we begin , I 'm going to have to tag you . Tag us ? You mean like cattle ? What the fuck is that ? LDU-7 is monitored by a series of high-frequency scanning fields . You need a subcutaneous marker ... a chip implant , to pass through these fields ... without activating security measures . You mean you 're gonna take that gun and put a chip in me ? It works best on the underside of the arm , just below the elbow . The chip itself has a life of less than 12 hours . It dissolves into the bloodstream . It 's painless . But I 'm afraid it 's a prerequisite of the tour . Yeah , man . Well , chip away . Thank you . Well , let 's begin . Oh , shit . God damn it . Mom goes out of town for a couple of days ... and the big bad shuttle pilot can 't even get to fucking school on time . $ 5,000 ? Jesus , man . I have $ 1,700 . All I need is the rest . Oh , okay . Well , $ 3,300 . Let me check my pockets . - I know the shit you do on the side . - What ? Thought maybe you had something , you know ? A little extra . All right . Look , man . I smoke the occasional blunt . I 've experimented . I 'm not a dealer . I don 't have that kind of change . What do you need it for , anyway ? Look , you 're not gonna tell anyone . You got that ? - Yeah , man . Whatever . - All right . - Hey , man . - Hey . Look , Neil , Neil , Neil . Come back . - I need to ask you a favour . - No . I know what you 're gonna ask and I can 't do it , man . I can 't lend you the money . How the hell did you know that ? - Look , I got to go . I 'm running really late . - No , Neil . Look , I don 't know how you knew that , but I really need the cash . Marc , listen to me . You really don 't . Please . All right , let me think about it . Okay ? The site originally operated as a slaughterhouse . How appropriate . Century invested $ 70 million in new construction . Well , once the new structure was up ... they brought me in to set up the main security system . - So you haven 't been here long ? - No . This is a great company to work for , Century . Terrific benefits . It 's so quiet . Well , there 's a strict no talking policy on the floor ... and there 's also acoustic tiles lining the walls . Sensory deprivation , a subtle yet effective form of psychological torture . LDU-7 only has a small handful of active security personnel . It 's very important to maintain a sense of order . So they were saying in Berlin about 60 years ago . These cells are all empty . Why are they all empty ? They 're not cells . They 're holding rooms for processing purposes . The stock is housed on the lower part of the unit . - The stock ? - The stock ? Sorry . That 's a little company lingo there . Charming . I wonder if they 'd rent one to me for my next birthday party . I hope that tag doesn 't pop loose and make me sterile . That would be the least of your problems . This is the central monitoring station , the nerve centre of the entire unit . From this room we can monitor every square inch of LDU-7 . - There aren 't that many guards . - Well , there 's no need . LDU-7 is 90 % automated . This facility is the first step towards a completely self-functioning penitentiary . Why is there such an obsession with automated prisons ? It makes fiscal sense . Completely eliminates the possibility of hostage taking or civilian injury . The insurance savings alone make it worthwhile . So you just lock them up and throw away the bar code , right ? - Isn 't that interesting ? - What is ? Cameras watching cameras . Currently the unit is housing 45 inmates . Out of those , 23 are the country 's worst serial killers . We also have child murderers , paedophiles , rapists . A little something for everybody . How lovely . I 've seen you on television . I like the stories you do . Thank you . Roger , maybe you want to try and get over in that area . Roger . - Roger . - Yeah . - Over there . - Right . I remember the one where you helped a homeless veteran find his daughter . - That was nice . - Thank you . Yeah , this is good . This is ... I love these computer screens here and these buttons . - I think we have what we need here . - Great . Thank you . We 'll let you get some shots of the power station . That 'd be great . A facility like this uses a tremendous amount of energy . We have the latest in micro-turbine generators . If you 'll just give me a moment , I 'll run a quick status check . We don 't wanna see the micro-turbine bullshit . We wanna see Newton . Don 't you think we should ease into it a little bit ? Sarah 's right . If we spook this guy we might never get past the cafeteria . The sooner we see Newton , the sooner we get out of this goddamn bug nest . - All right . I 'll talk to him . - Just put the heat on him , baby . Exactly how do you suggest I do that , bright eyes ? Well , he spends all day with men . You 're a woman . Use your imagination . - Oh , hell , no . - No , hold on a second . Hold on a second . There 's something missing here . There . That 's better . There 's something that you don 't understand ... - about our computer genius Mr Manson . - And what 's that ? He also spearheaded a movement within Century ... to extend coverage to same-sex couples . - Oh , hell , no . - There . That 's better . - I don 't think I 'm his type , darling . - Just put the heat on him . Oh , okay . What the hell . I 'm all for experimenting , anyway . Mr Manson . Norbert . It 's Norbert , isn 't it ? Can I talk to you for a second ? - Is everything all right ? - Oh , everything 's wonderful , Norbert . It 's wonderful . We just feel that ... while we 're sure the power station is a fascinating component of LDU-7 ... we 're really more interested in the inmate population . - The inmate population ? - Yes , one inmate in particular . A man named Fisher Newton . I see . I really think that you would be much more interested in seeing the power station . Yes . Yes , of course . - This way . - Right . Because ... Because they can . - That makes sense . - Yeah . What 's up , Mr Manson ? The security gate was right here . - Maybe you just got turned around . - Well , it wouldn 't be hard in this place . We 'll take the stairs . I think our boy Charlie 's going around a bend . - He 's not the only one . - What are you saying ? - I mean , there was a security gate here . - How can you be so sure ? Because when we got through it ... I put a piece of chewing gum underneath the fire extinguisher . - You want some ? - You 're a pig . Oh , come on . Don 't be that way . There 's plenty enough for two . - Cut the crap , Kurt . - I barely chewed on it . Come on . I just got my shots . There 's no risk . Come on . Gracias . - Show me your arms . - We just showed you our arms . I need to reprogram your implants . It 'll make you invisible to the security systems . There are certain things going on in the unit , things I don 't understand . What kind of things ? It 's better if you see them and hear them for yourself . Hey , man . Marc , gotta get up . - Marc . - What ? I 'm up . $ 2,800 . It 's yours . - Look , thanks . - Lf you tell me what it 's for . - Cut the shit . - No , come on . It 's my bike savings . It took me two years to scrape this together . Yeah , well this is more important . Believe me . Dude , I am flaming out . Or as Dad would say , I 'm crashing and burning . I 'm this close , Neil , from getting kicked out of the fucking astronaut programme . See this shit ? I fucking hate it , Neil . I fucking hate it ! I never wanted it ! Come on , man . Maybe it 's just this physics stuff , you know ? No , it is more than that . This is about Mom and Dad . They 're the ones that always wanted it for me . More like they wanted it for themselves ... so they could tell their friends about their golden boy . Does Dad know ? What do you think ? Look , Neil , I wish I could walk away , but I can 't . I wanna tell all those people to stuff their bullshit programme , but I can 't . All right , but how 's the money gonna help ? There is someone on the inside that 's ... Who knows the answers to the next few exams ... and they 're willing to sell them to me ... but they don 't come cheap . - Jesus , man . No . - Look , it 'll get me back on track . It 'll keep Mom and Dad happy . If they see me crash and burn , think about what it 'll do to them . Please . Come on , Neil . Hey , man . Come on , let 's get up . Marc . You look like hell , man . You gotta get up . You got your applied physics exam today , right ? - Yeah . - Right . Look , Neil . Do you have the money ? I know some tricks for memorizing the Navier-Stokes equation . Let me show you . - Stop embarrassing yourself . - Marc , you 're in over your head . Let me help . - You 're gonna help me with this ? - Yeah , that 's right . What , are you kidding me ? You can 't stand being the little guy around the house , can you ? You know what ? You really are your worst enemy . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . I always thought you just didn 't get the science , but the truth is ... it 's your attitude , man . You 're so full of yourself , you can 't even accept a little help . And that 's what 's gonna bring you down . I can 't believe you wanted to buy the answers to your test . Okay , how the fuck do you know this ? - It doesn 't matter . - Yes , it does matter . - Give me 15 minutes . - This whole family is fucked up . Okay , you know what ? One call to Dad and you 're fucked . So I 'm taking away your choice . Now let me show you this . No . No cameras . No cameras . I could lose my job for even letting you into this area . - Okay . - Maybe even my life . All right . All right . No camera . - Is it okay here ? Or safer here ? - It 's fine . The inmates are required to attend weekly psychotherapy sessions . This is where I first heard the stories . What are those ? Cages ? We call them STCs . Safe Transport Carriers . - You 're kidding . - It 's all part of the automated design . It safely transports the stock ... The residents , throughout the facility . It 's Fisher Newton . - You know him ? - Not personally , no . Good afternoon , gentlemen . Fuck off and die , bitch . Russell , we 've discussed your anger management issues before . Cut the shit and show us your tits . This kind of acting out can result in only one thing , Russell . Fuck you . Fuck you ... - Does that happen frequently ? - Yes . I believe we left off the last session with Mr Newton . I have nothing to say . Why don 't you tell us about your dream ? I said I have nothing to say . " It 's like a shadow , a darkness you can 't see but you feel all around you . " It comes in dead of night . You can sense it moving around you . " Its breath is warm and foul . " This is what you said at our last session . I was confused . Were you confused when you murdered your mother and father ? You 're just trying to provoke me . You must realise , Mr Newton , that these dreams you are having ... are simply subconscious fears manifesting themselves during the sleep cycle . Now what are you afraid of ? You . They 're being taunted , the prisoners . This whole fucking place , the silence , the isolation ... the whole torture session . What a combination . If that 's what it takes to maintain your participation , Mr Newton . I 'll kill you , fucking bitch . They aren 't dreams and you know it . They 're real . I 'm awake when they come . When who comes ? When you and your fucking people come . Look at my arms . You think I did this to myself ? We all have these marks . You 're doing it to all of us . It 's all true . It 's true ! It 's true ! It 's true ! It 's true ! Some of these men have been sensory deprived for months , some even years . No matter how strong they are , they all eventually break . It 's as if they were all designed to exacerbate aggression . It 's a fucking disgrace . It 's just that judgement is not a part of my job . You 've heard him say this stuff before . This isn 't the first time you heard him say it , right ? This was a mistake . I should never have brought you here . Wait a minute . You brought us here for a reason . What ... I told you . I was just brought in to oversee the implementation of the security system . I don 't know what the hell 's going on here . All I know is that there 's something about this place . What ? What ? Sometimes I could swear that the walls move . - Like the security gate . - Yes . Or a door that 's been in one spot suddenly vanishes overnight or a ... Or a corridor that used to turn to the right now turns to the left . At first I thought it was just me . I thought I was confused . But then ... It 's more than that . I don 't know . It 's ... Well , I know and I 'll tell you what it is . I want 10 minutes with Fisher Newton alone . - No , no . No way . - Yes . Yes . There 's a way . He knows something and you must believe that . Otherwise , you 'd have never invited us into that observation room . I want 10 minutes alone with him . I want a one-on-one . - Wait a second . You 're just the camera guy . - I just got promoted . Look , you already opened the door , my friend . You might as well go through it . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's okay . We 're not going anywhere . Just give me 10 minutes alone with Fisher Newton . Open up the security door . - Ten minutes . You 're not going in his cell . - I may look crazy , but I ain 't . - Stay on Channel 3 . - Right . Norbert , what is the function of this control panel ? - Digital archives . - Digital archives ? Yes . Every feed from every camera in the building is stored here . You mean to say that every move we 've made ... since we got inside this unit is in here ? Yes . All I have to do is press " time " , " date " , and " sector " . Time , date , and sector . That 's interesting . Listen , why don 't you take Einstein Junior for a little walk ... while I look around to see if there 's anything we missed ? - Right . - Right . - Oh , shit . - What ? I left my bag in the observation room . This way . - Mr Buck , please don 't touch anything . - I 'll be waiting . Be quick . Time , date , and sector . Okay . Hey , let me out of here ! Let me out of here ! Newton . Fisher Newton . - Who 's there ? - My name is Chuck Taggart . Taggart . Is that supposed to mean something to me ? Shut the fuck up over there , motherfucker ! You 're gonna have to excuse Mong . He gets testy when he hasn 't eaten . Of course , he has a very particular diet to begin with . He only likes to eat family members . Ain 't that right , you crazy motherfucker ! Eat ass , motherfucker ! Newton , listen to me . I believe what you said . What you said about your parents . Listen , I 've seen it myself . I 've seen people bleed white soup . I 've seen it . I don 't know who you are . I 'm not very interested in playing mind games right now . I 'm not playing any games with you , Newton . Listen to me . I came here to talk to you . Why ? Because the future of everybody on this planet ... may depend on what you tell me . What do you wanna know ? You said you were awake when they came for you . Who 's they ? Where do they take you ? People come at night . After we 're asleep . They take us down . They drug us . I think they put something in the food . But sometimes ... Sometimes I hide the food , don 't eat it all , so I can remember . Where 's down ? Where are they taking you ? Some kind of sub-level . It 's dark , cold . I 'm hanging . Floating . I 'm not alone . They 're doing something to us . Some kind of experiments . My God . - What is that ? What are they doing to you ? - I don 't know . Where is down ? What is this sub-level ? How do I get down there ? Take the stairs down . South of the central monitoring station . Just go all the way to the bottom . Chuck . Chuck Taggart . Chuck Taggart , can you hear me ? Over . - Yeah , Kurt , what 's up ? - I 'm in the monitoring station . You need to see this . Come . I can 't do that right now . I 'm in the middle of something . What 's going on ? - Just get back here quick . - Right . - I 'll come back . - You 're not leaving me . I 'll come back . That wasn 't a question . That 's a statement . You 're not leaving me ! You 're not leaving me . It knows ! You 're never getting out of here ! You 're never getting out of here ! - Kurt , what 's up ? - Come and look . - You 're never gonna believe this . - I find that hard to believe . - Watch this . Here . - You 're right . I don 't believe it . Keep watching . Jesus . Okay . You got a theory ? What ? Well , yes . But it 's only a theory . He 's a Synthetic , but new and improved . One we haven 't seen before . One who can walk through walls ? Well , I 'm guessing so can the guards , 'cause they all seem to have disappeared . It 's like this place is preparing for something . Where the hell 's Sarah ? She and Manson are off to the psyche ward . It was the only way to get rid of him and rummage through the archives . Where are they ? Can you find them ? Show me where they are . Hold on . I 'm actually getting pretty good at this . There they are . Bad habit . I know . - Doesn 't bother me . - It bothers most people . It 's how I deal . I have Asperger 's . - Asperger 's ? - It 's a mild form of autism . Do you wanna know something really interesting ? What ? There 's a higher concentration of kids born in Silicon Valley with autism . It turns out that a lot of those computer geeks are borderline . - How did you end up here ? - I 've always been fascinated by prisons . Maybe because I 've always lived inside of my own . Yeah . We all have our own form of prisons , huh ? Some of our own making . But I wanted to build a place that would relieve these people of their fear . Maybe free some of these guys from their anger . Jesus . What the hell is that ? What the hell is that ? - I don 't know ! - Did you touch something ? - What 'd you touch ? - I 've been touching everything , Chuck . I told you this place is preparing for something . Now we know what . - Get down . Get down . - Why ? Do you ... - Inmates are out of their cells . - How did they get out ? Sarah . Sarah , pick up the goddamn walkie . Sarah ? - Chuck . - Yeah . Damn it . Stay here . I 'm gonna go after her . - You 're not going out there alone , are you ? - You wanna come with me ? - Be careful . - Right . Stay on the walkie . Aye-aye . Fucking John Wayne . - You have to get back . - And what about you ? There 's a security station just down the corridor . I 'm gonna try to seal off the ward . Just go back the way we came . - But I can 't leave here with ... - You have to get back to the control station . Access the maintenance command directory , file A-5 . Sarah ! No . - No ! - Come on ! Come on ! - You guys lost ? - Come on ! Where 're you going ? Oh , shit . Do something ! Kurt , open that door . Can you open that door from the computer ? Yes , Chuck . I 'm on it . I 'm on it . Kurt , open the door . Yes , yes . Come on ! He sacrificed himself . He hardly knew us , but he gave his life for us . People . They will surprise you . God , we gotta get out of here , you guys . It might not be so easy . Look . Another wall that didn 't used to be there . - The building is sealing us in . - Lf it actually is a building . I found Manson 's file . Here it is . Those are precise instructions . I don 't know what they do , but maybe they can get us out of here . - Well , do it , God damn it . - I 'm not a computer whiz . Thanks to your brilliant direction , Chuckie ... the computer whiz is on the outside doing his fucking final exams . Where he should be . Do your best . I 'm gonna go find that sub-level that Newton was talking about . I 'm gonna go find out what the fuck is going on here . File A-5 . See , this is a subsidiary power source . It looks like it feeds part of the building . Manson 's programme file A-5 was designed to cut it off . Well , how can that help us ? It follows a theory I 've been formulating about this building . What new theory ? Some kind of sub-level . It 's dark , cold . They 're doing something to us . Some kind of experiments . - Sentients create Synthetics , right ? - Right . And Synthetics , or at least the ones we 've seen , look like us . I 'm still with you . Well , darling , we 're dealing with an entirely new form of Synthetic here . - What kind of new form ? - We 're standing in it . This building is the Synthetic . Frazier and the guards are all part of the building , part of the same organism . - How the hell can that be possible ? - Well , it 's possibly a new kind of material . A fluid compound that can be shaped and reshaped at will ... by the Sentient 's mind . But what I 'm thinking ... and that 's what Manson must have figured out ... is that to maintain such a structure requires an enormous amount of power . Hence , the secondary supply . And if we cut off that supply , what happens ? We 'll soon find out . My guess is , put your running shoes on . Mr Manson . - Camera guy . - Yeah , that 's me . - Evil . - What ? - It 's studying evil . - It ? That 's why it built this place . It brought the worst of evil to itself . Cultured it . Just listen up . I 'm gonna try to get you out of here . I don 't know exactly how , but I 'm gonna try to get you out of here . Just hang on a minute . Step away from him , Commander Taggart . You can 't help him . What are you doing to him ? He 's dead . You fucking freak . There are two more of your compatriots upstairs , Commander . - You 're gonna answer some questions . - Oh , really ? Am I ? - How many more of you are there ? - About six billion . How many more of you that know about us ? Not nearly enough . It 's true what he said about what you 're doing here , isn 't it ? We 're not studying evil if that 's what you mean . Evil 's an imprecise term . More accurate : Aggression ... rage , hatred . Well , it seems like you got that pretty well covered , don 't you ? Compared to your species , we 're amateurs . Amateurs ? Amateurs of what ? What in the fuck are you ? We 're the future . Now . Fuck . I knew I should 've taken that computer science course in college . Wait , it 's working . It 's working . It 's working . Chuck , things are happening . The doors are opening . It 's working . - Just get the hell out of the building . - And you do the same . Go , go , go . Come on , come on . Sarah ! Chuck ! Oh , God . Fucking John Wayne . Hey , man . What 's going on ? What does it look like ? I 'm leaving . You 're leaving ? - Where are you going ? - It 's none of your business . Marc , you 're still in the Air Force . You 'll be AWOL . No shit , Sherlock . Dude , what are you thinking ? They can court-martial your ass . They can put you in jail . You 'll be running the rest of your life . Look , I don 't expect you to understand , but I can 't be any worse off than I am now . Well , what about Mom and Dad ? She 's gonna be worried sick . You 're gonna break Dad 's heart . Look , Neil , I can 't be what they want me to be . Look , just take care of yourself . And ... tell Mom and Dad I 'm sorry . Oh , so you 're just gonna go chicken shit and run away . Is that it ? Where 's my money ? You didn 't use it to buy your exams , did you ? Look , I will pay you back when I get settled . No . Bullshit . I didn 't give it to you for this . Yeah , well , that 's what I 'm using it for , and you can 't do jack shit about it . You 're such an asshole ! Yeah , I know . There we go . - Hey , man . How 'd you do ? - Not too bad . - Yeah ? - Yeah . It was tough , I do admit . Did not ace it . But I think I passed . - That 's great , man . - Yeah . Nice job . Now , I still don 't know how you knew about the money and the physics equations . What do you think , I just sit around smoking that wacky weed all day long ? I got my eyes open . All right . If you wanna be that way . Shit .

 Okay , guys , it works . The principle is a variation of the Bailey 's own grapple technology . I just wanna make sure it 's gonna hold up during combat conditions . Let 's face it , Mauser , you don 't exactly have 100 % success rate with your gizmos . Uh , guys , I - I 'm still floating here . Remember the cloaking generators ? Oh , and the self-replicating body armor that wouldn 't stop replicating ? The stealth shoes . Do you remember the sonic gastro-disrupter ? I 'm really starting to feel kind of woozy . I do the best I can . Every new weapon needs field testing . Yeah , on us . Is this beam harmful ? And if we do manage to snare a Bailey , it 's not gonna be too happy . That beam better hold . Well , it 's managed to keep her up there . Is that a fat joke ? Mauser , let me down , please . Thank you . So , how are we going to lure a Bailey into our web ? Hel , this is not a joke . With this device , we can trap a Bailey , and Cleopatra is the key . Ooh ! Hel , now ! Cleo , get out of there ! Okay ! Take him down , Sarge . Triggering impulse . Damn it , Mauser ! It made us ! Fall back ! But the pod ... Cleo ! Got you ! Get in the shaft , now ! Are you okay ? Yeah . You wanna tell us what the hell that was all about ? I thought we didn 't leave team members behind . That is not a team member . Look , Cleo , I know you have some kind of empathic link with that thing , but it 's a piece of Bailey technology , and it 's dangerous . Being on a Voice team is dangerous . Just because I can 't do any of those flips or kicks and stuff , doesn 't mean that it 's fair that you get to take all the risks . She 's right , you know , Hel . Cleo , you do take risks . You sat out there as Bailey bait and you didn 't even flinch . The issue is knowing when to cut your losses and run . Well , how am I supposed to know that ? Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home .

They don 't . You wanna tell it that ? It wants that Pod worse than we thought ! You 're right ! I should have left it on the surface ! Hel ! Hit it ! I guess that 's why the Bailies don 't come down here . Voice , what the hell just happened ? Why didn 't you tell us about those guns ? Hel , I have no record of weapons of that sort found in any shaft . Somebody put them down here . I can only assume they were created by the Shaft Builders as an automated Bailey defense . Voice thinks the Shaft Builders put them here . The Shaft Builders ? Hmm . Who are they ? Good question . After the Bailies came and all the chaos , records were destroyed and lost . After a while , no one could remember who built the shafts . The Builders became kind of a myth . Well , whoever they were , they sure knew how to make firearms . It didn 't work out quite the way we planned , but we 've got a Bailey down . I say we crack it open and look inside . We don 't even know how far it went down . Maybe all the way . There 's one way to find out . Looks pretty dead . Let 's go . Whoa . That didn 't take long . It must have sent out a mayday on its way down . Then there 'll be more on the way . The clock 's running , Hel . We can handle one Betrayer , but how do we get inside ? Well , I know one person who 's been inside a Bailey . I was sucked up into its tractor beam . I don 't know where the front door is . You almost got yourself killed saving that Bailey Power Pod . Why don 't you use it to get us inside ? Ready ? Now ! Pod , don 't fail me now . Sarge , take cover ! Cleo , we 've got company ! There 's gotta be a place to change the oil or something . Uh-oh ! Guys ! Sarge , now ! I never thought my contribution to the team would be as a Bailey proctologist . Get inside ! Hurry ! Go ! Sarge , seal the door . That 's not gonna hold for long . Anyone else here thinking this wasn 't such a great idea ? I figure we can find the nerve center , power up the weapons and take out those Betrayers . Which way ? Why do both of you think that I 'm the expert on the Bailies ? Cleo , listen to me . You have an ability that Sarge and I don 't . Call it intuition , call it telepathy , call it whatever you want , but you can communicate with Bailey intelligence . Right now , that 's the best hope we have of getting out of here alive . Okay . I think it wants to go this way . Great . Okay , then . Ew , it 's like walking on a shower drain . W - Wait . What was that ? I don 't think we 're alone in here . Cleo ? Stop ! I seek truth and enlightenment on the Mother Planet ! Oh , he 's a Dwork . They must have been shipping him to the Betrayer factory when we intercepted the Bailey . The crash must 've released him from stasis . Don 't worry , we won 't hurt you . Do you serve the Emissary ? Yes , we do . And the great and powerful Oz commands us . If you just follow the yellow brick road , we 'll take you to the Mother Planet , okay ? This way . Where did you guys come from ? We 'll tell you later . Okay , I 'm getting good vibes . Um , the brain room should be dead - What are those ? Ever heard of antibodies ? Auntie who ? Automated internal defenses . We 're the disease , they 're the cure . Sarge . Duck ! Everybody get behind me ! Guy , they won 't attack one of their kind . In there ! Stay . This is it . The Bailey brain . There aren 't any controls . Nothing we can tie into . How do we power up weapons ? Who are you ? You don 't serve the Emissary . Don 't freak out , man . Oh , great . The Betrayers would rather destroy this Bailey than let us have it . They 're going to hurl us down the shaft . Uh , okay , you can freak out now . If you have any great last words , now would be the time ! There 's gotta be some way to power up the engines . Those shaft guns fried everything . What have you done to the Emissary ? It 's what the Emissary 's gonna do to us , kid . Let 's get out of here ! Cleo ! Let me change the batteries . Swap this bad Pod for my good one . There 's no time ! We 're gonna hit bottom any second ! It 'll work . I know it . We 're still falling ! You must have been the smartest one in your village . Cleo , why are we still falling ? I - I don 't know . Maybe the Pod doesn 't know it 's supposed to stop . Well , tell it ! Cleo ! Cleo ? Cleo , are you okay ? What 's happening ? You have to tell the Bailey to stop falling . Cleo ! I hear . Cleo , what 's happening ? We 've stopped . She did it . Good job , Cleo . Sarge ! Are you okay ? I think so . There 's some kind of force field around her . Cleo , can you still hear me ? I hear . What 's going on ? Status : systems nominal . Contact reestablished . Contact reestablished with whom ? This unit has been alone . This unit will return . Where does this unit want to return to ? Return to base . Well , we 've been wanting to get to the Bailey HQ anyway . Yeah , but there 's only one problem . The shaft cannons . I don 't think this thing will take another round of point-blank plasma fire . No . Hel , start ripping . If we can cut off the juice to that force field , maybe we can grab Cleo and run . What are you doing ? Stop it . This is sacrilege ! I said stop it ! Are you crazy ? You 'll be taken to the facility . Do not resist . I guess this Bailey was coming from the Betrayer factory , not going to it . You 'll be taken to the facility . My mission will be successful . We 're not going anywhere . The cannons that took this Bailey down are gonna tear us to shreds when we get to the top of the shaft . Then a Voice team will die . My mission will be successful . Cleo , can you hear me ? Silence ! Cleo , you have to listen to me . You must stop . Listen to her , Cleo . You 're part of our team . Every day you remind us of our humanity , of why we do what we do . Enough ! We need you ! I will destroy you . Cleo ! Hang in there , girl . Cleo , you okay ? You 're back ? You 're back . Come on , let 's go . Wait . The Pod . Let it go . But - No . You don 't need it to be part of this team . Let 's go . Okay . Well , the mission was to bring down a Bailey . I 'd say mission accomplished . Bye-bye , Pod . Hey , how you doing ? Okay . I 've got like a sonic hangover . Communicating with that Pod was like talking to somebody at a rock concert . So how 'd you get through ? I don 't know . I couldn 't even hear myself think until you guys started talking . You brought me back . Thanks . You 're a member of our team , Cleo . And you just saved our tails . I think we saved each other . Yeah . Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

Most people not have to remember . Just know it . Do you have three friends ? Am I one of them ? I 'm new in town , you know ... Stop for a moment , this is for me very type of a serial murderer . Where do you come from exactly ? Do here ? No . How come this island ? I do not know . I have no idea how I ended up there . Who was before . I do not want to talk ... Let me try to understand this . Are you saying you have amnesia but seem to know everything about everything ? My mind is constantly full of information . Whether the percentage of shots Gary Payton in 1998 o . .. changes in patterns climate of Antarctica . If you know , I know . How ? Why ? I have not the slightest idea . And this ? Does it hurt ? No . Was here . Karen , I can trust you ? Sure . No problem . I do not want to expose this as a show of oddities . I have to go to guitar class . I do not know . Stop ! What ? Did you get anything ? Come . Make me happy , Stu . - Already have your wife . - That was then ... Will you have an ID ? No trace of clothing . Traces fingerprints disappeared . Can you tell me something or will to call a doctor ? A woman , by the radius of the skull . And by the oxidation of the barrel been here over 30 years . Listen , please ... What was here before ? One parking . Before ... Before . According to the cadastre solar belonged ... Steven Prescott . He had a house there from 1960 to 1968 . Probably acted as John Wayne Gacy and then buried in his backyard . Can you access files Automotive Department at that time ... and take a look at this Prescott ? Received . This is the aspect that was 35 years ago . Should you be kidding ? Would you explain how you have Young remained so over the years ? I do not know . Maybe someone sabotaged the basis Automotive Department . And seeing my photo manipulated the article in the newspaper . Why should they be so much trouble ? " Upset ? A Hacker , if persists , may getting through a back door ... using the loop system , and through the firewall . There are more than 2500 codes destroy the second level ... protection from intrusion detection . Okay . You have accessed my permission . Beautiful . But I have answered . Who would want to get involved ... in a crime 34 years ago ? Or some clown put his picture at random . " An enemy ? A former amok ? Wherever Steven Prescott has left a trail of bread crumbs . I could only find his ex-wife . That 's something . Let 's see you get out . He told my detective . But this involves you directly ... You can not go there ... Someone is getting involved . Not far away . He has not said a word since who suffered a stroke 5 years ago . I 'm afraid it has been up here for nothing . Could you tell us your ex-husband , Steven Prescott ? The truth is that it does not seem appropriate discuss the private lives of my patients . She is a nurse . His work is caring for people . If he were truly concerned about this lady ... Now you can help . I remember Agnes called Steven , " the big mistake . " In fact , I myself I started to call it . Do you know why they divorced ? The cheating bastard . Who was the lucky one ? Not sure . Agnes swore not speak its name . It felt so betrayed by she , like her husband . Someone close , a friend , a sister . Is there a photo album that we see ? He came here without any personal effects . All your memories are ... Inside . Yes . Mrs. Prescott ... Murderer . I assure you . I called him in the face : a murderer . Well , this is sharing too . You 're not getting any easy to be your friend , John . She thinks I 'm her husband , and it is not possible , right ? You should have about eighty . The average male reaches facial maturity at age 18 . Be 18 years 1968 would now be 52 . You do not have 52 years . The old have 52 . Like you 're a vampire , or something . Karen , I 'm serious . I do not know how I know . Could be an alien reliving your old identity ? But seriously , have you medical tests done To see if you are human ? I 'm glad I shared this with you . You could be a time traveler . That 's why you have not aged at all . Jumped in time . Time travel is impractical ... according to all theories . Current , " but in the future ? I can not believe you do this . The course is called " Physics and Time Travel . " My boyfriend says that the type served until 13 : 00 . I give it five minutes . Open mind , John . Beautiful flowers . Let me guess : Have you been a week with your boyfriend ? I 'll tell you that pesticides used to cultivate ... endanger the tiger beetles . Toma . Read a little .

His shoes are cloronol , a litter synthetic alternative ... to provide the same elasticity and appearance of leather . Nonsense . No nonsense . Absolutely . You blouse , on the other side ... Is wool . No sheep died for it . For the two strands dyed fiber Handmade wool is Australian . The Australian government aware of the killing ... of 5,000,000 kangaroos annually . They are considered a pest because they eat the grass ... they need for their sheep . A pleasure chatting with you . All this is hypothetical . But using two laser beams ... Rotating in the opposite direction ... could find a new solution To the field equation Einstein 's gravitational ... for a circular power source . Not work . Note account of the paradoxes . I 've done . But protection conjecture Chronological Hawkins states that the laws of physics ... Conspire to prevent bodies to convey information ... the past . An outstanding , Mr. Doe . Should get a house and build a family . Are you saying that a passenger in time would run out of memory ? In theory , yes . It would be a cosmic device intended ... to avoid the paradoxes . My hypothesis is that a time traveler would have ... encyclopedic knowledge . Does this mean that people the future would be more ready ? Yes . Homo Sapiens evolve . It 's the most logical . In 100 years , perhaps 100,000 years people ... use a greater percentage of the brain . Perhaps they know everything . Sure . Why not ? Tell me this Doctor . Is it possible that my friend has traveled to 1968 and has been linked to a woman ? You 're kidding . There is only one way to know . MRI . What do we say ? I imagine that time travel is like sending a fax . The information is transmitted from point A to point B , but some ... Bits of information are lost or altered in part . The copy is never exactly the same . An MRI will tell us if there is any flaw at the molecular level . That betray a trip back in time . At least in theory . It is crucial to remain totally immobile . The first resonance apparatus Magnetic called him " the wild " . Now on display at the Smithsonian . Yes , I know . - Alto , take me out . - What happens ? - I think I 'm claustrophobic . - Do you believe ? Karen , I am claustrophobic . What do you think ? Every day something new about me . Is it always like this ? It 's complicated . I think it 's best sedation . The tranquilizer is good . What gave me ? " Frazlin ? " Clorozepan ? Remember to keep quiet . It gets noisy inside . I know . Did I mention that I know everything ? The machine is not taking any pictures . What happens ? Something is interfering . " Mr. Doe , have Piercings ? No . " Bypass , aneurysm clip ? Has any metal object ... inside that distorts the magnetic field . I have to leave . I saw something . I saw something . No ... no ... John ! Where can you ... ? Here you are . Where were you ? I looked everywhere . Talk to me . What 's wrong ? If something goes wrong , I want to help . You can not . No one can help . Can not be you , unless you have had surgery or something , right ? What about John ? What ? Hello ? Are you at least listen ? How long am I here ? That 's funny . Was a second ago in my department . No . You were saying that neither even know your age . I see things . Memories , visions or something . I see everything in color . Big deal , I also like everyone else . No . I 'm monochromatic vision ... or at least it was . This must mean something . What is happening to me ? This makes no sense . Look 're scaring me . First was that of " I woke up in a island , " you slam the door in my face , and then you 're viewing monochrome and now you 're not . Sorry . What 's not happening . It 's just that ... . Your whiskey on the rocks . Did I ask for this ? It is a difficult question . Maybe I had a concussion when I hit my head to make the resonance ... or maybe the electromagnetic field MRI sparked memories . Or they can be abductions . Maybe was so time travel . I 'll take the whiskey back . It seems that you are intoxicated . Whatever . When you had those visions were actually ... in 60 in Woodstock ? How old pretend ? Another difficult question . My second wife used wondering the same thing . Always ended in a discussion . " Do I look fat in this dress ? " that was different . So this is where you spend your time when you 're not bothering me . Frank , Digger . Digger , Frank . I think you already know my assistant , Karen . Hello . It seems that our case " Closed " has been reopened . Did they identify the victim ? Who is it ? Prescott was employed . Records show that he worked for them more than 5 years . Then calculate what happened : The husband has an affair with employed . The woman suspected ... And the husband kills employee cover-up . What 's your name ? Elizabeth Menzogna . Now we the reason , we only Prescott . I think not ... Look , I have serious doubts about you . But I know you did not kill anyone 30 years ago . That 's impossible . But it is a good idea to show because it is impossible and ... that Avery has to explain this to their superiors . That Prescott is elusive . No record of him until 1960 . As if out of nothing . And then ... the police started investigate the disappearance of the employee . And he disappears from the map . Disappears as Copperfield . So the only way to go after he is through his victim . Had a whole life ahead . I have to know more about it . " You 're hiding something ? Well , let 's go . Where ? It is not the only one with brain Mr. Mysterious . I located a cousin of the victim . How 's your wife ? It is all very clear . I only care about my work . I 'm never at home to read bedtime stories . And when was the last time I went to a baseball game ? When was the last time ? Work as usual to give them a better world . - Your child has been in Hawaii ? - No . Why ? Should take . I doubt very much that you want go with me somewhere . His father is always here there does not make it funny . That glass container , has a capacity of 15 gallons . Each candy measures approximately 0.6 inch By 0.3 inch wide taking into account the compression ... and unit weight . I would say containing 21,773 sweets . What if in the middle has a balloon ? It would be unethical . Welcome to the real world , John Doe . You know , you could be the realistic type and I the mysterious and intuitive . I always hope that Elizabeth was alive . It might seem ridiculous , after so many years . Absolutely . Sometimes we can only hope . So at the time of disappearance worked ... for such a Steven Prescott , right ? I 'm back from everything and do not walk around the bush , Detective . My cousin was having an affair with that man . She knew it was wrong . But love is love . I could not help . Any idea where can be Prescott ? Hope died . Excuse me . My pastor always preaching about forgiveness , but ... Quiet , in this case may be an exception . It was rumored that when the police began to investigate ... Elizabeth 's disappearance , he vanished . Perhaps fled the country . How can you be so sure Prescott was killed ? Did you know ? No , but ... I feel it in my bones . As found out about the baby . What baby ? Your baby . His son . Son ? What was it ? I have to know . I was afraid of what Prescott might do if he found out ... and I gave up for adoption . To protect it . If we were a child , a paternity test ... demonstrate that Prescott was justified . The adoption records were dealt with long ago . I never wanted to know . We must find records now . Disc ? lpelo . ' re A novice , is training . All I have is this . " I can ask some questions ? John , I thought that it would like . It seemed that the house had too look for housing . It will be because I live here . Truth . I know . But going to try ... A tribute to the work of Omaz MC , 1946 . The eye . No . Is that the eye is a Hook logo . You know , for the business . " Private Eye " do you like ? Although I know very little about my own tastes , I know I do not like . Fussy . All right . Paint it again . The only reason I have not gone running and screaming murderer ... is that I have to believe this madness , it means something . Something important . Me too , Karen . Wait . And this photo ? Is our first official track ? Prescott has a son . Born in 1968 . - Are you kidding ? - No . .. could be me . So let the hypothesis of time travel ? This really makes sense . So I 'm sorry . None of this makes sense . What happens to your mental vision ? Some flaw in my brain or damage by magnetic resonance imaging , do not know . This photo . See ? Prescott could be my father . Discusses family resemblances . Your father is a murderer . It could be my fault . Y Vanessa could hold the key to ... all that . She knew me , cared me , I prepared for adoption . Great , you gave up for adoption as me . As always tell me glad not to have known ... my real parents . Who knows how sick could be . 175,324 children were given up for adoption in 1968 . 59 % were male . What if I was one of them ? I have to talk to Vanessa . I just did . No . But Hayes . About me , about Elizabeth . Maybe she can unlock my memory . And to answer that . " John are you okay ? I see a bit worn out with this . I mean , this could be just a coincidence . A second of these on your computer and the next second ... appears on Vanessa . What you ask me to believe ? Why you went there , if had to be finished ? - Just wanted to talk . - On what ? About me , my past . On the infant . And that has to do with you baby ? I 'm really fed up of this routine , John . Sorry , I just ... Were with the victim , question her ... applying the third degree hours earlier . What happened to that ? This is you is getting ugly , John . I have had gaps , from the resonance . These visions , voices ... The voice of who ? How Vanessa ? Was the voice of Vanessa ? Did she scream ? Not . It 's too blurry . Going to be better than begin to concentrate . Just beginning to trust you . We 've seen a lot the bloody bastards ... and there is something in your eyes , I can see . But who is John Doe , do not think it such . I heard you . It 's all you have . You can not echo on a hunch , Frank . Give me some time . Let me try . I just lay in this work . I can not keep track ... a guy who has fallen from heaven , despite much to help us . I have an idea . Maybe give us some answers . It is too late for that . We are preparing the inmate 's clothing . " it is better to risk saving a guilty person than to condemn an innocent one . " Voltaire , Zadig . Chapter VI . Are you now also a philosopher ? Only 5 minutes , Frank . Please . State v. McCartney , New Jersey , 1992 . What happened with it later ? The analysis of traces of blood exonerated the suspect . Will you try to do that here ? It is worth trying . Pretend that this is the fourth where Vanessa was killed . The table was here , and Most of the blood here . Now , by gravity , by air resistance ... and the direction that the blood had , Vanessa would be sitting right here . " I did all this in your head ? The majority . Sorry to take , you are ready . Now , for the angle tear between the third y . .. ... Fourth vertebra , the murderer would have been ... here . Tu , best you turn away . Was better away ... If you had killed 'd be covered in blood . Not only pants . I musta bed and crawl over it . You have only 12 hours find out who did this . Frank , " thou wilt it . Where did you learn all this ? On the Discovery Channel . Frank , I want to thank you . All this ... Yes .. Let 's not get very sentimental , right ? Papi ! What are you doing T-Man ? Mom said she was tired of expect that we will spend looking . Frank ! When will you learn ? Can you talk to me friend John for a moment ? Papi is coming soon , right ? What is that you have in your clothes ? Only fatty acids , corn syrup concentrated food dye # 7 . Fake blood . Did you know that Alfred Hitchcock used syrup Bosco chocolate to mimic ... blood in " Psycho " ? And did you know that the fear of blood is called " Hemophobia " ? Did you know you talk weird ? Did you know that your laces are untied ? " Return , return , and there we go ! " Please calm down . Tyler , listens ... Daddy has to work late today so that you will go home to mom . Yes ? Again ? You still owe me a hug last night , and I will collect today ... earlier . Give it to me . Very good friend . Great guy . Yes , it 's having a hard time this issue of separation . If I 'm correct , I would say that you have your own . That trick to tie his shoes . Where did you get ? In truth comes from ... I do not know where it comes from . It 's something that ... I do not know . Well , there seems to First time for everything . Come on . The clock is ticking . Hand me the pliers . What do you have ? Strange . Quercus petraea . French oak . It has more tannin than any other species . Extremely rare . Not grow at less than 6000 miles away . Did not you say that the body was found in a ... ? Barrel of oil . Made of stainless steel , double coating capacity of 14 bbl . Just like a barrel of oil but it is not . It 's a tank ... fermentation . Used to produce wine . So , whoever killed Elizabeth had to have access to something like this . This restricts the search a bit . A winemaker . Someone working in a fermentation plant . Great , a winemaker . Only 3 companies exported this type of wood in 1968 . The last time I checked . I got it . Vineyard " Columbia Terrace . " Founded in 1968 . The only winery in the entire Northwest French oak that still matters . It says here that the owner is William H. Leverton . William Henry Leverton , born in 1967 , died in 1968 . So it was that Prescott did . Stole the identification of a dead child established a new industry ... and continued to produce wine . We 'll bring some friends with us . This guy could run away at night . Nothing . Quiet ! Hold your arms . What 's happening ? This man is very ill . Is this man Steven Prescott ? No . His name is William Leverton . This is your home . How long is in that state ? And are 2 years . Are you Steven Prescott ? Do I seem familiar ? What do you want ? Sorry . I think we committed a serious error . Are we related ? There is nothing like staying empty-handed . Where are we ? What ? Is this some kind of game to you ? Just leave the house ... of Leverton 5 minutes ago . I 'm getting tired of this . I have had another fainting spell . I do not know what is happening . Your brain is not receiving enough oxygen . Oxygen ... Turn around . Leverton is Prescott . It is the murderer . Really ? then let me raise again the tactical unit . Your respirator . Oxygen focused on a viral system M5 . A pressure system a switch to adjust ... valve cycles that compensate for the altitude . Still had the factory defaults . - That said a nurse or whoever ? - I was pretending . Not even going to use the oxygen . It was an illusion ... to have an alibi . - And the nurse Raches ? - No team had configured properly . I bet your pretty dress ... was a Halloween costume . It was probably the wife of Prescott . If we are wrong twice I 'll make a better day . Trust me . Damn . He will take 10 minutes ahead , wherever you go . You may have another residence . Going to the airport . Now we are clairvoyant ? They confirmed it . Mr. and Mrs. Leverton . Come on . To the left . It is not there . The normally congested traffic at the entrance 520 of the Evergreen bridge . And usually there is a traffic congestion ... in the east of the city . So turn left and take the South by Rainier . To the left . Then take the floating bridge I-90 . Will run into the truck Street Cleaning 515 We will reduce the advantage . You 're better than GPS . Accelerates in the 519 . So what intercepted on the 149 with the 8th . Hold on ! Hold on ! What remains ? We analyze the DNA of the body . What body ? Look at this , the car completely melted . There is nothing . No .. No , I have to confirm it was ... Steven Prescott ? I think you confirmed that . You are officially out of suspicion . What about the Doctor ? Did he say that you alien ? That 's funny . I 'm not . Do you still see in color ? No . And the gaps are gone ? Unfortunately , not I 've had in a week . Retrograde amnesia could be post-traumatic ... gaps in neurological trauma , result of a concussion . Why unfortunately ? I you were happy not to have ... acid hallucinations . Karen , I saw some figures . a woman , maybe . What if these visions were a window into my subconscious ? Memories of my past , who I was . And now they 're gone . " We did X-rays ? Yes . Small traces of metal in my chest , right here . Nothing of the device then Travel in time ? I know nothing about that . If a brand could have metal particles ... what burns my skin . But what kind of brand ? And why ? Or maybe it 's a simple tank of iron in the epidermis . Basically , the Doctor answered your questions with more questions . The story of my life . Did you find an answer ? Prescott How was your father ? No . You know , never replied really your question . When asked if they could trust me for this . Can . He was right . Wait a minute . If your father was Prescott , that means the woman who found In a barrel was your ... Yes . The granite can last a long time . It is very nice . Now take care of it .

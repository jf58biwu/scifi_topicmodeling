 25.000 Bicyclops Built for Two Good news , everyone ! Several years ago , I tried to log on to AOL , and it just went through ! We 're online ! Go ahead , get into these Net Suits . I designed and tested them myself . It smells like burning monkey . Oh ? I guess when you 're around it all day , you stop noticing . Off you go ! Behold ! The Internet ! My God ! It 's full of ads ! Follow me ! It 's immense ! It 's got every piece of information one could ever want . So I see ! What 's going on here ? - That 's me ! - No , it isn 't ! I just took some pictures of your face and put them on someone else 's body . Are you over 18 ? I 'm telling you , they 've got a chat room for everybody . Here it is ! That is so gross ! Yeah . I 'll stick with this one . Hi . I 'm a naughty nurse , and I really need someone to talk to . $ 9.95 a minute . You 're a dollar naughtier than most . How about them Knicks ? Hello ? Any girls in this room at all ? Yeah , bring on the hot chicks because I 'm a hot stud ! - So are we ! - I 'm a woman , if that 's what you mean . I don 't play games , so I 'll say I 'm a Cyclops a space captain , the only one of my species and I want to meet a man . A woman ? I 'm scared ! Thanks to the Internet , I 'm bored with sex . Any website to satisfy my lust for violence ? Is the space pope reptilian ? Get ready for fun , Fry . Nowadays , we have a game played entirely on video . We call it a video game . Video game , you say ? Well , golly gee ! You mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works . The doctor is in ! The doctor is out . Please sign off . We have a delivery . Plus , I have to use the phone ... Leela , please tell the others that ... Who are you ? Saw you in the chat room , but I couldn 't talk to you . After all these years of searching for another Cyclops . I 've dreamed of this moment all my life ! Do you think , perhaps , you and I ... ? Idiot ! Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I 've been searching for my people , my planet . I meet another Cyclops , and you blast him ! That was my one chance to learn who I am ! Oh , I feel terrible . If there 's anything I can ever do ... Gotcha ! I won ! I 'm the greatest ! Come on , we have work to do ! Are you still mad at me for wrecking your only chance to learn the meaning of your life ? I 'm just happy you won a game . Now let 's get this desperately needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14 . Leela , you 've got mail ! It 's not spam ! - It 's him ! - To Leela . Subject : I am Alcazar . I got your screen name before being shot by that moron . Kicked your ass . We have to talk . Come join me on the planet of your birth . Coordinates follow . Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery . It 'll get there . After a lifetime of searching , I may have found where I belong . Too bad it 's a dump . Look , that statue 's only got one eye ! - Lazy sculptor . - Welcome home , Leela . Alcazar ? Are you real , or am I seeing single ? Of course I am . After all this time , somebody else with one eye who isn 't a clumsy carpenter or a kid with a BB gun . It 's all right . You 'll never be alone again . Come , let me introduce you to yourself . - Do you mind if your servants walk ? - Not at all . We are the last Cyclopses . Our planet is Cyclopia . The capital , Cyclops City . Am I going too fast ? So much information . Yet , somehow I feel as if I know it already . This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty . Any artwork of her from the back ? You have the same eye . Had our race survived , you 'd be a temple priestess , or a supermodel . Oh , please . Really ? The pirate Purple-Beard , scourge of the Six Seas . What 's that ? The Forbidden Valley , where no one may tread . Is that like a cemetery ? Because I have to pee . Fry , that 's offensive to our people ! Isn 't it ? This is my home . I hope you 'll pardon me for living in a giant castle . Of course . If anything , I 'm more impressed I 'm gonna need to make some room ! Here I dream lonely dreams and cook simple meals . It 's all so sad . What happened to our people ? It 's too painful to speak of now . I 'll show you your rooms . I heard you from my room . What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's just ... I don 't want tears in your perfect eye . Is it about the fate of our people ? Because I 'm very interested in that . Okay . But it 's chilly . You 'll be all wet with tears . Let 's go into my chamber . It Wasn 't long ago our people Were happy and prosperous . But the eyeless Mole People greWjealous of our visual prowess . They fired missiles in all directions , hoping to hit Cyclopia . Unfortunately , one of the 40 planets hit Was ours . - How far away , do you think ? - A trillion miles ? Things got hot . You look a little hot , actually . Take off that jacket . Our people don 't like heat . Just before the impact our smartest scientists saved one baby . Alcazar , I used to be a baby . It might have been me ! Fortunately , I Was a pool cleaner . And When I emerged from retrieving a dead possum , I Was the only one left . It 's so tragic . Yes . But the real tragedy is that our race ends with us . - It doesn 't have to . - You mean ? You 're a male , and I 'm a female . I 'm still not following you . Wake up , my king . Jeez , what a night . Make me some coffee , would you ? - Sure . What else with that ? - Pancakes and sausage . Kitchen 's in the basement . After breakfast , we can talk about rebuilding our civilization . Great pancakes . Yeah , they 'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes . We don 't want to look like slobs in front of the others . Do these dishes , and organize my collection of naked celebrity photos . - Look , Alcazar ... - Call me Al . I know you were living alone for a long time . I can sympathize . But I 'm not a maid . You 're right . I 'm sorry . I guess it won 't work . So much for the Cyclops race . Okay , okay . I 'll do the dishes . Hey , where 'd they go ? Leela 's experiencing a woman 's greatest joy , worshiping a lowlife jerk . He may be a lowlife jerk , but I don 't trust him . He 's hiding something , I 'll find out what . Try and stop me ! Al ? I did my hair the way you wanted it . - Who are these people ? - Friends . Where 'd you get this couch , and that TV set , all this stuff ? They were giving it away on the corner . Just like you , Leela . Too bad they weren 't giving away what you need : Mouthwash , a back wax and stain-proof underwear . You go , girl ! Fry 's in the dungeon . Feed him so he doesn 't die and stink up the place . Can 't you let the little guy out ? Jeez , Leela ! Twice in one day ? I 'm not Superman ! Why did you go to the Forbidden Valley ? Because Alcazar 's hiding something . You may not like it , believe it or want to hear it . Alcazar 's a jerk . He 's bad for you . - I know . - You do ? If it 's obvious to you , with your learning disability , of course I knew ! He 's gross and treats me like a slave . Dump his one-eyed ass ! I can 't . If I leave him , that 's the end of the Cyclops race . I won 't let that happen , even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness . Leela ? Mop-up in aisle number two ! - I 'll break up with him at dinner . - I 'll be there . Leela ! Pig says your slop tastes like crap ! Yeah . Like crap . You deserve better than this guy . Dump him already . I 'm trying . Hey , everyone , jam a sock in your spit faucets . I used to spend nights renting slasher flicks with Rat and his girl . Then a beautiful woman arrived ... Stop eating ! She brought new hope for me and our civilization . A million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question : Leela , will you marry me ? No ! No ! Yes ! I will ! They 're getting married . - Congratulations , Leela ! - This is great ! - Glad you could come . - A magical day ! Welcome ! Get me out of here ! It 's horrible eating scraps dropping my waste everywhere , like an animal . - Animals go in the corner . - Why didn 't I think of that ? I 'd like to help you , but it 's my wedding and I 'm kind of busy . Here , try to be happy for me . At least one of us will be . That 's it ! It 's time for this bird to walk . We 've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar ! Let 's see why it 's called Forbidden Valley ! No , thanks , I 'm good . You can steal some forbidden stuff . I don 't know . For the first time in my life , I feel like I 've stolen enough . Bender , snap out of it ! Sorry , I don 't know what came over me . Let 's go ! I love stealing I love taking things That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me . Come on , boy . Jump ! Good boy ! Whoa , Mittens . My God ! Four identical castles ! Each more identical than the last ! Weird . It 's another Cyclops , only this one has five eyes . And here 's another one with no eyes . Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss ? Saving a race of one-eyed monsters ? Who could object to that ? Cut to it , preach . Do you take this woman ... in sickness ... love ... do part ? I do . Faster ! Do you , Leela , copy and paste his response , till death do you part ? I ... Oh , my God ! Hey , Alcazar ? You left somebody off the guest list . Why you are so late for our wedding ? And why you have only one eye ? Hey , sweetie . Just go back to the castle and wait for me . I can morph into a five-eyed alien , and I kind of said I 'd marry her . But I 'm really a Cyclops , and I 'm really going to marry you . Oh , yeah ? Then what about this ? - This is a bit awkward . - Who 's she ? - Who are they ? - Go back to the castle . And maybe you 'd like to meet her ? And her ? Leela , this must all be very confusing . A little . That 's why I 've decided to hurt you until you explain it . - Show us your real form ! - Yeah ! Do it ! Well , this is the real me . But I can explain . We all have needs . I needed five weirdos to scrub my five castles . I gave you what you wanted and made money letting Pig watch through a two-way mirror . Can any of you say you wouldn 't have done the exact same thing ? He 's a saint ! But why all five weddings on the same day ? You know the price to rent a tux that changes shape ? - I just have one last question . - What ? If you can change form , why not change it in the one place that counts ? - Thanks for saving me from that creep . - Hey , that 's what I do . I was so desperate to find out who I really was , I forgot who I really was . No harm done . In the decades you 'll work to repay me for that popcorn you destroyed you 'll have plenty of time to search for your true home . I mean , how many planets can there be ?

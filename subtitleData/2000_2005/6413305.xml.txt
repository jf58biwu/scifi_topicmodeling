 Are you with me there , Mama Bear ? - Oh , yeah , Farscape . - I 'm reading you loud and clear . Authorizing flight computer to initiate acceleration sequencing ... now . Roger , Farscape . You are go for insertion procedure . Farscape One , hold a moment . Hold ? Canaveral , what ? ! Meteorology reports some kind of electromagnetic wave . Repeat , some kind of wave . John , do you read me ? Son , you have to abort ! Abort , now ! I only know what the doctor told me . What the hell ? I think he 's going to come out of it on his own . All right . I 'll call you if there are any changes . Good-bye . John ? That 's my name . Don 't wear it out . Nurse , call a doctor . Hey , how you feeling ? Ah , hot . Dizzy . Kind of ... feel like I 've been hit by a house . You 're going to be okay , son . You gave us all quite a scare . I told ' em you were a survivor . Yeah , I am that . It 's good to have you back , son . What are you doing ? ! Son ! - I 'm not your son ! Get him off of me ! You 're a fake ! Get your hands off me ! Get your hands off of me ! Let go ! Don 't touch me ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Right , we 'll need full restraints . And can you get me a clean I.V. , please ? Jeez , get ' em off ! Get ' em off me ! Get the ... It 's not real . It 's not real . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . Aeryn , honey , could you get me out of these straps ? What happened ? The last thing I remember , I was on a Commerce Planet . Mr. Crichton , my name is Dr. Bettina Fairchild , not Aeryn . Bettina ... Cool name . Still disoriented ? You have no brain damage , as far as we can tell . You do have a fever . Probably a low-grade infection , but some antibiotics should clear that up . Might clear your head as well . Hey , are they listening to us ? Is that why you can 't talk ? Violent and now paranoid . Perhaps another CAT scan would be indicated . Sorry . I , uh , fuzzed out there for a minute . What day is it today ? Today 's Monday . Monday . - It 's been a week since you crashed . I crashed ? I don 't remember crashing . But I did have this , this terrible nightmare . I was on a ship full of aliens . Is that why you went after your father and bruised two of his ribs ? Yeah . He looked like he was human , but he had alien goo on the inside that was ... pretty freaky , huh ? But now you know better . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm all clear . Look , I 'm not going to hurt anybody . You can let me out of these straps . You called me Aeryn . Old girlfriend . You look a lot like her . Except you have prettier hair . Mmm . Is my Dad around ? Out in the lounge , I think . I 'd like to say I 'm sorry . Probably best you do that yourself . Thank you . Do you good to move the muscles . Thank you , Mr. Crichton . Will the owner of a green van parked outside admissions please move it immediately ? You will be towed . Won 't get fooled again . Hey , you mind ? Sorry . I thought it was co-ed . Co-ed ? What planet are you from ? Not this one . Hey , yo , yo , dude , are you done with that paper ? Yeah , sure . Here you go . Thank you . - No problem . " Gator victim number six . " Last week it was five . They 're getting the details right . Hey . Hey , how you doing ? Well , I 'm better . I 'm much , much better . Look , I am sorry about earlier . You don 't need to apologize , son . You 've been through a lot . I lost it myself when your mother died . Mom ... - Papa Bear ! Whoa , ho , D.K. ! Hey , hey , hey , you made it this time . Glad you 're up and about , man . Sick of getting reamed on my own . Oh , getting reamed , are we ? IASA 's got a blown mission . They 're tossing around words like " pilot error " . There was no pilot error . It was Meteorology 's screw up . They didn 't give enough warning about that electromagnetic wave . He was told to abort a dozen times . He did abort . Yeah , not soon enough . He blacked out . And he still managed to land the module . He trashed the sucker . The Farscape project 's circling the drain . Okay , what do you want me to do ? Pull it together . First thing you need 's a clean bill of health . Dr. Fairchild says you 're okay physically . She 's not going to kick you loose without a full psych report . Doc Betty said that ? That 's right . You gotta get shrunk . She wants you to see a Dr. Kaminsky . " Dr. Jean Kaminsky . " Man , hot in here . Hello . Yeah , hey , I 'd like to order a pizza . Um , medium . Deluxe . Man , these guys are good . Thank you , Charles . Sorry to keep you . Zhaan . Zan ? Adjective or name ? It 's a name . Then I 'm afraid you 're mistaken . I 'm Dr. Kaminsky . Uh-huh . And you are a psychiatrist ? Mm-hmm . I don 't think so . On Earth , psychiatrists don 't come in blue . Do you have a problem with people of color ? I have a contextual problem . You 're an alien . Yes , that 's true , but I do have a green card . Interesting . Are you or are you not blue ? Would it matter to you if I was ? Do you always answer a question with a question ? Does that bother you ? Stop it . Facts . You 're a Delvian . A plant . Tenth level Pa 'u . We shared Unity once . " Shared unity . " Interesting euphemism . No , Mr. Crichton , you and I have never had sex . I 'm sure I 'd remember if we had . Put your hands on my face . Humor me . Just ... here . Damn . What were you expecting ? Expecting ? Nothing . Hoping for an ally . You feel you don 't have any allies ? Not in this joint , no . My enemies haven 't revealed themselves yet . And who are they ? The Ancients ? Nah , they picked my brain already . Maldis ? Uh-uh , not his style . Not gothic enough . Delvians . Mmm . Yeah , Occam 's razor . Tahleen and her wacky bunch . Come out , come out , wherever you are , and see the young man who fell from the star ! Kim , cancel my 3 : 00 appointment . In fact , cancel the rest of my day . Hey , what 'd you tell her ? Oh , trauma , stress , crash . You know , made me imagine things . Everything she wanted to hear but hey , I 'm all better now . So you got a clean psych report . Great . Yeah , go figure that . She let me loose . I would have locked me up in a padded cell . Ooh , ladies . You know that guy ? Gary Ragel . Newest hotshot to come out of IASA astronaut training . Watch your back . He 's got ambition . Gary Ragel has tentacles . - Yeah . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , it 's a straight boy ! What ? He looks normal to you ? It 's a lifestyle choice . Anyways , his looks are the least of his problems . He 's a jerk . Hey , D.K. , how you doin ' , huh ? Ooh ! Missed it there . How you goin ' ? You almost ran us down , Ragle . Yeah , not even close , my friend . How you doin ' ? My name 's Gary Ragle . I know you . You are John Crichton . I 've heard you 're one hell of a flyer . Let 's go get a beer . We don 't have time for a beer . Oooh , no time for beer ! Beer ? Keys . My friend , one thing you have to learn . There is always time for beer . I got a theory , though . You wanna hear it ? Yo . This is an experiment . Somebody 's messing with my mind . Trying to see which way I 'll move next . Sort of like a rat in a maze kind of thing , huh ? That 's right . I am some alien 's personal science project . I so know how you feel . You know , life 's a bitch . Let 's get another drink . Hey ! I got a plan , though . 'Cause they 're testing for reactions to the freak show ? Uh-huh . I 'm not going to react . Let ' em deal with that . Yeah ! Yow ! Hey , buy a girl a drink ? Oh , my God ! The off-duty doctor ! Join us ! Gary Ragel meet Dr. Bettina Fairchild . Ooh . Hi . - Hi . Excuse me , you two know each other ? No . - Never met . How about another , yeah ? What ? Another drink ! More drink ! Come on , huh ? ! Three more drinks ! You know . Yeah , I got it . Pitcher of beer ? - Sure , buddy . Dig your style , Ringo . John , we haven 't got much time . Twins . Pity your mother . Now you listen to me . He ... he 's not real . Oh , right . You are . So , what 's your name ? Who do you play in this fun house ? You know my name . Scorpius . Scorpy . You don 't fit the pattern . You got no Halloween costume , got no assumed name . You 're not playing a role . That suggests something to me . That suggests that you are the man behind the party ! In fact , I 'm the only one that can help you . So , what are you looking for this time ? You looking for wormholes again , huh ? ! In fact , I have to leave now , John . Nah , you aren 't going anywhere ! Okay , let 's talk . You 're no Zhaan , you 're not a psychiatrist , but you 're as close as we 'll get to either one . I 'm flattered somewhat . Look , somebody is gaslighting me . It 's probably Scorpius . It 's got ... gotta be Scorpius . Been having hot flashes of the bastard ever since he stuck me in the Aurora Chair . What am I supposed to think ? Uh , what is this ? Uh ... I never left Earth ? Uh-uh , the whole Moya thing is-is an illusion ? It 's-it 's a dream ? What does that get him ? The thing is , he didn 't start out too badly . You know ? Th-they didn 't make the mistakes that the last guys made . Even Aeryn . Even Aeryn , I could have bought . Probably not , but I-I-I could have bought it . Aeryn . You may have caught a glimpse of Dr. Fairchild . She treated you after your crash . Yeah , and my feverish imagination turns her into a Peacekeeper chick . So , what 's the game ? I wish I could help you , Mr. Crichton . It 's strange . I miss Moya . A ship full of aliens becomes so normal . There is , of course , another interpretation for your confusion . Yeah . I 'm still on Moya . I 'm gibbering . I 'm drooling , and everybody 's wondering what finally made me snap . That is one possibility . Maybe . Son ? Got some news . Oh yeah , what is it ? lASA has brought in a new project administrator . A Douglas Logan . You can 't afford to piss this guy off , John . He 's a tough bastard . So what ? Listen , tough guy or not , right now , your future 's in his hands . Thin face , pale skin , bad set of choppers , likes leather ? I 've only talked to him on the phone . I don 't know . Nasty piece of work , though . Nasty ? Excellent . Let 's talk to him . Come on ! Whoa . Nice digs , man . Hey ! Come in . You 're late . Guido ! You 're here ! Ho , hey , fellas meet the new boss . Not the same as the old boss . Mr. Logan , please excuse my son . He 's ... Shut up ! So , you 're the reckless son of a bitch who refused to abort , fainted and wrecked a multizillion-dollar module . That 's me . Ah ... astronauts . Cockier than God , all of them . Give me one reason I shouldn 't fire your ass and shut down the whole Farscape project . Sir , the project could bring great benefits to this organization . John 's experiment will pave the way for deep space exploration , sir . Cork it already ! D. Logan ! Quit with the cards . Now , listen up . IASA can 't afford another failure . We get your sorry project right on the second attempt . Quit it with the cards ! People will forget about the first . Second attempt ? Yes . The one I just authorized . Now , either you can fly it , or Gary Ragel can . I hate to reward failure but it 's better P.R. if you fly it . Public loves " come from behind " wins . John , the module could be ready within two weeks . You can do it again , son . Prove your theory is correct . So , that 's the play ? Ha . The play . The play , the play is the thing . I reenact ... my initial mission . I show you how I create the giant blue twister that sucks me down to Oz . Forget about it . Don 't know how I did it . Crichton ... Hey , Scorp ! Are you out of your mind ? ! You think if I knew how I did it , I would help you ? ! Get lost ! Who the hell are you talking to ? Oh , um ... not you . You 're not real . - What ? ! Mr. D. Logan . Wh ... where are you going ? What the hell was that about ? Are you trying to sink the Farscape project ? The guy gives us a second chance and you throw it back in his face . Hi girls . The guy ? ! The guy , the guy , t-the guy 's a two-foot green slug on-on a golf cart ! What does a man 's disability have to do with anything ? Crichton ? Crichton ! Son , apologize to him , please . Crichton , I wasn 't finished with you . Oh honey , I 'm sorry . Let 's kiss and make up . Oh ! Are you deranged ? ! Well , yes , of course I am . Let me show you how I crash-landed ... - How dare you ! the Farscape module . - I 'll have your hide ! There 's an elipso-magnetic flow ! So we had to abort ! Abort now ! Go ! - Hey ! Hey ! No , Crichton ! Go ! - Help ! Oh , no ! Crichton ! What ? It ain 't real . They made you up out of my memories . It 's just annoying that you 're acting exactly the way I thought you would . You ... look at you , look at you . You 're crapping yourself because you think you 're going to lose your job and Dad , you 're just pissed off ' cause I ain 't playing the game your way . It is annoying . Go away . Go home , home , go home . Shoo . Hey , hey . Hey . Hey . Hi ! ¿ Como esta , hombre ? John , I want you to meet a good friend of mine . This is Jessica . Oh my God . Everybody 's finally here . You 're an astronaut , too ? Yeah . Oh . Oh , I like astronauts . You 're an astronaut groupie ? Yeah . That so works for me . You want to go for a drive ? No , John . We must speak . Does anybody see the ... freak in the next booth ? Uh ... nope . No . - No . Then , let 's go for a drive . Yeah ! We 're on fire ! Yeah ! Come on , John . You 're driving like a chicken ! Aye , yi , yi , yi , yi , yi ! I got a new theory on life . You wanna hear it ? Oh yeah , man . Lay it on me . Lay it on me . Life sucks , nothing matters , screw it all , let 's party ! I am so there ! - Me , too ! Enjoy it while it lasts , Johnny boy . You betcha , especially when nothing 's real . This is no time to be having fun , John . Get lost . You 've got to focus . Fight this delusion . What , like I believe anything that you 'd say ? Get over it . John ... John , listen to me . It 's time to bail , Scorpy . Good morning . The truck won , I 'm afraid . And how are our friends ? Gary and Jessica ? Mm , yeah . They 're fine . Hey . - Hmm ? As a doctor , don 't you think a crash like that would have killed us ? Well , we were very , very lucky . Oh , yeah . Now . Hmm ? You have a visitor . Ooh . Who ? Dad ? D.K. ? Someone new . A Sheyang ? Captain Bialar Crais ? Bring him on . Thank God you 're okay . I came as soon as I could . Don 't . This is a pretty good trick , considering you 're dead , Mom . I had to come . Oh , sweetheart . Uh ... You 're not real . You 're sweating . Don 't worry . Don 't worry . There . I 'll make everything all right . There , my Johnny . There , there ... there . That 's it , yes . You 've changed . People change to survive . But did you have to lose so much ? You were so innocent . So full of wonder . It 's all gone . You 've become callous . You 've killed . You can 't know that . It 's true , isn 't it ? That 's what bothers you . That 's why you can 't sleep nights . I sleep fine . Where are you going ? Away from something that isn 't my mother . Are you going to leave without saying good-bye ? All right , let 's do this . Let 's talk . What about ? About what 's going on . Well , I 'm on my break , my man . Why don 't you give me a break , my man . Well , that 's all I 've got for you , man . I don 't know you and I don 't care for your problems . Great . You 're not the guy . You 're not the guy I need to talk to . Hey , Col. Col Get this man a drink . Coming up . John ? Help me . You 're not real . I need you . I 'm afraid . You 're ... you 're not real . They pulled you out of my mind . You died five years ago ! John ... I 'm scared . I just want out of this . Stay with me this time . Be with me when I go . No , please ... Please , ple ... Please . No , no . Oh , god . This is cruel . This is cruel . Please don 't . I need you with me . Please don 't . Don 't do this to me ! Don 't do this to me ! You got a problem , pal ? Oh , well . If it isn 't the good Captain . Would I be patrolling a beat if I 'd made captain ? Hell , I 'm still bucking to transfer to plainclothes . And give up the uniform . Bad choice . Say , you 're that John Crichton guy , aren 't you ? That astronaut . I don 't know . A few too many , huh ? I don 't know who I am anymore . You better come back to the station with me and sleep it off . Just leave me alone . Please , just ... I 'm gonna get you off the streets , mister . Leave me alone . Don 't ! Leave me alone ! Leave ... me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! Oh my . Look at this . Ah , Mr. Crichton . Delighted to see you again . We were just discussing your future . Oh , I don 't have a future . Not in this reality . Son , you 're in no shape for this . Clearly feverish . John , be careful . You 're risking a full cognitive dislocation . Oh , I 'm about as cognitively dislocated as it gets , but I am clear on one thing . Scorpy can , ah , either let me loose or watch me go berserk . More berserk , I 'd say . You seem obsessed with this Scorpius person . Can you tell us why ? Can 't be healthy for you . You 're not real . Or ... you 're in on the plot . Either way , it doesn 't really matter what I do . I 'm disappointed in you . You 're holding us up , John . Can we please get on with our meeting now ? Is anyone else hungry ? I 'm starving . Shall we send out for some lunch ? Oh , anything but Thai food . Pizza ? No , I 'm sick of pizza . How about deli ? Corned beef on white for me . Stop ! Have you any idea how much trouble you 're in ? Yeah . Do you ? I like your style , hombre . But this is no laughing matter . Assault on a police officer . Theft of police property . Illegal possession of a firearm . Five counts of attempted murder . That comes to $ 29.40 . Cash , check or credit card ? Toto . This thing is going completely off the rails . Or maybe I have . Not yet , you haven 't . But there 's a danger you will . You 're here . Did you bring the keys ? It 's not me that 's doing this , John . It 's a Scarran . He captured you on the Commerce Planet . I don 't know any Scarrans . What would a Scarran want with me ? Well , now that the Scarrans know I 'm after you , they want to know why . This is their ... standard method of interrogation . Induced delusions to break down all mental defenses . The Scarrans aren 't trying to fool you , John . They 're trying to break you . This is a deliberate attempt to drive you into insanity and it 's working . Your mind is about to crack , and I cannot allow that . I was here first . No , you weren 't . True . The Ancients were here first , implanting the wormhole knowledge I seek . But when my Aurora Chair failed to unlock that information , I had to implement a second strategy . You put something in my head . A very sophisticated neurochip . It contains ... well , it contains me . Or a mental clone of my personality . That explains the visions I 've been having . Precisely . I was supposed to have remained hidden , but now and then your subconscious would become aware of me . That 's why I couldn 't kill you on the Royal Planet ? Of course . A simple fail-safe . But my main function is to access the wormhole knowledge you have in your brain , no matter how long that takes . You 're Harvey . Or is it Clarence ? Guardian Angel ? Invisible rabbit ? Harvey ... Harvey . Does the Scarran know you 're here ? I only manifest myself when the Scarran 's attention is elsewhere , as it is now . I must disappear when he returns . Ignore the false Scorpius he 's created . And do not confide in anyone else you may encounter . How do I know you 're telling the truth ? You 're sweating , John . You 've been unusually hot all this time because ... because your real body is reflexively responding to heat . The heat ... a Scarran produces . And when your body temperature lessens slightly , the Scarran is elsewhere , preparing another onslaught . It must not succeed . How do I stop it ? Focus . Concentrate on what is real . Your true memories of Earth , of Moya . Your family , friends . Even your enemies . Do not allow yourself to be pushed over the edge . But remember this . The Scarran has not disarmed you . Your weapon is of no consequence to a Scarran . Their skins are extremely tough . Pistol fire will not kill a Scarran before he kills you . So , your best chance is not to shoot but ... But to what ? The temperature 's rising . I must go . To what ? Harvey ! But to what ? ! You look like you 're ready to have some fun . We certainly are . What are you doing ? Nothing you won 't like . Nothing you haven 't already fantasized about . Admit it . You 've had sexual thoughts about all of us , haven 't you ? Not me . Oh , come on . You 're a male . It 's just the way you are wired . Nothing to be ashamed of , not when females are willing . Say , what 's your pleasure , boss ? I 'm a doctor . Just relax . I can wear a Freudian slip . I find new places to take your temperature . I can teach you left handed Latvian rodeo torture . All of you bitches out now . Crichton is mine . This is for calling me Sparky . And this is for Fluffy . And this is for Buckwheat , whatever that means . Oh ! Leaving so soon ? ! I wish I could ! Look what you made me do , John ! I opened my veins ! You 've made me lose my job ! You dumped me for your new pals ! Some friend you are ! Some friend you are , man ! Oh , come on , Papa Bear ! Look at what depths your son has driven us to . Don 't look at me . You 're the one who wanted a child . I wanted a terrier . Oh , you couldn 't give me what I really wanted . Oh , so we get this loser ! He can 't fetch a ball , he can 't get my slippers , he can 't even land a damn Module in one piece ! - Oh , no ! My baby ! Freeze ! You 're under arrest . You have the rights to the remains of a silent attorney ! If you cannot afford one , tough noogies ! You can make one phone call ! I recommend Trixie , 976-555-LOVE . Do you understand these rights as I have explained them to you ? ! Well , do you , punk ? ! No . Then I can 't arrest you ! John ... I really need to just unburden myself on you . What ? Well , lately , I 've been thinking about you in a very different way . Uh-huh . Mm-hmm ... And I was wondering if you would mind participating with me in a little Luxan bonding ritual . Here 's the thing , okay ? What we need are some chains ... Uh , my Qualta Blade ... just a little squirt of Iutra oil and ... Oh ! Chiana . Chiana . Yeah . She wants to watch . Oh , no . Oh , yes . Such a fascinating library you have . Such wonderful , informative books . " Oedipus Complex " ? I 'm not sure I grasp that concept . Could you , um ... explain it to me , Johnny ? No . Oh , please . You 're such a smart boy . I really ... I really want to know . Ohh ... Hey , John ! Get down and boogie ! Boogie-oogie-woogie ! Hey , man ! Get down ! Boogie or die ! Oh , no , no , no , no , no ! I don 't boogie ! Crichton ! Crichton , where are you ? Where are you ? Where are you ? Where are you ? Clear the dance floor ! I searched half this world for you . Where am I ? Still on the Commerce Planet , but underground in some sort of holographic chamber . I destroyed the projector . Who nabbed me ? Scorpius . Sc ... I killed him . Scorpius ... Was , um ... he was behind this ? " Was " being the operative word . That 's interesting . Why is it interesting , John ? It 's just ... it 's just that he , uh ... Tell me . Later . Let 's , uh ... let 's get out of here . No . Tell me now . No . No , you get nothing from me . Frell you then . Stay . Boogie or die ! Hey , yo ! Kiss my friend you are , man ! ... thinking about you ... Then I can 't arrest you ! Be with me when I go . Brain wave patterns are increasingly irregular . The captive is finally weakening . Increasing stimuli to calvo nine . Calvo ten . Dead ? All neural activity ceased at 635 apneth one . Captive apparently suffered full synaptic overload at stimulus level calvo ten . Because no baseline data exists with this species , this reaction could not have been anticipated . Remains of the captive will be held for ... Well done , John . What happened ? I feel like ... I died . I had to stop your brain function for a few microts , to divert the Scarran . No harm done . I 'll go back into your subconscious mind now . Don 't get too comfortable . I 'm gonna get that chip out of my head . There 's no chip in your head , John . Yeah , there is . You told me ... There 's a , um ... men ... men ... You were saying ? M - mental chip ... mmm ... Uh , you were saying ? What am I saying ? I 'm ... As it should be . I won 't trouble you again . Until I need to . There 's an exit to your left , which will no doubt take you back to the surface of this Commerce Planet . I leave you to your shipmates , John . But rest assured , I 'll be with you always , keeping you safe .

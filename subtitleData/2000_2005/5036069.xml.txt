 " You almost won a million dollars . Please try again . " What does it say , Tommy ? I can 't look . Who cares ? Aw , man . Are you still moping about Alissa ? What am I supposed to do ? She won 't even talk to me . Everything was going really great right up until graduation . I don 't even know what I did wrong . You gave a commencement speech that was mostly about making out with her on her parent 's bed . No one ever remembers those speeches . If it makes you feel any better , I don 't think you 'll ever do any better than Alissa . Ohh ! If I could just talk to her face to face , we could work it out . I know it . You just need an excuse to go over there . I know . Um ... Think of something sentimental that you gave her and then just ask for it back . Yeah . That 'll stir up her emotions and get you in the door . That is good . Thank you , Sally . A beer tap ? Yeah , remember ? We rented it for our senior party and we forgot to return it . I 'm out 40 bucks deposit . I never want to see you again . 20 bucks of it is yours . Oh . See ? There 's a spark here . Alissa , honey , who is it ? It 's Tommy Solomon , Daddy . All right . Come in . Uh , the tap 's up in my room . I 'll go get it . Hello , Thomas . Hello , Strudwick . I thought Alissa had given you your walking papers . I 'm sorry . My what ? Dumped you . Gave you the boot . The old heave ho . Oh , yes . Yes , she did . But she 's a big girl . She can change her mind . She can make her own decisions . And who 's to say that she won 't make those decisions with me ... in your Jacuzzi ? You shut your mouth . Okay ! All right . Bye-bye , Daddy . Where are you two going ? What 's in that suitcase ? Those must be my walking papers . Dick ? Dick ? Is Alissa here ? No , she 's not , Strudwick . Why don 't you join her and not be here together ? Well , she disappeared three hours ago with your ragamuffin son . Ragamuffin ? Sally , throw him out . Harry , bring me a dictionary . All I know is there was a lot of whispering . And when they left , Alissa was carrying a suitcase . Harry , did Tommy say anything to you ? Only that he loved Alissa , needed Alissa , and would do anything to get Alissa back . Yet over ice cream cones , he spoke highly of a girl named ... Alisha . You know , Dick , when Tommy left , he did say he had a plan that would bring him and Alissa back together . Oh . Young impassioned lovers sneaking out of the house on a secret mission with a suitcase ? I 'm stumped . Sounds to me like they 've eloped . See , I knew . That 's what I- - This is a catastrophe ! Now , now , Strudwick . As fathers , we must bless our children 's choices and let them follow their hearts . Dick ! Does this mean that you and beardy-face guy are gonna be related ? No , not at all , Harry . I- - Oh , my God . We 've got to stop them ! â™ª [ theme ] Seat belt on . Lumbar support in . Vanity mirror ... Where the hell is it ? We 're in a fantastic hurry . We have to wait for Mary . It 's vital . [ Mary ] Dick ! Over here , Mary ! Hurry up ! Oh ! I got your message . What 's so important about a Charlie Daniels CD ? Chase music , Mary . What chase ? What 's going on ? There 's no time to explain . We 're in a fantastic hurry . Tommy and Alissa have eloped somewhere . Oh , no ! Yes ! They might be at that little chapel by the state line . Great idea . Get in . Chop chop . Dick , could you move your seat up just a little bit ? I finally got it how I like it . Go in through Strudwick 's side . Hey . Hi , Tommy . Hi , Tom . Tommy , did you elope with Alissa ? No . Mm . Goes to show ya . I knew it . But we returned that tap together . I convinced her to watch a video with me tonight . Yes ! I just came home to change shirts . Cool . See , I figured out what was wrong with our relationship . She wants a man . She sees me as an immature doofus , you know . But ... I ask you this : Would an immature doofus rent this ? If I Were You , I 'd Get Out Of That House In A Hurry III . What gives ? What do you mean ? We watch that , she gets really scared , wants a big , strong man to protect her . Yeah ! Ah ! It 's all gonna go fine . I know it is . Or else I 'll just move to plan B. What 's plan B ? Flowers . But sometimes even they don 't cheer me up . Poor Tommy . He 's desperate . If Alissa isn 't scared into his arms tonight , he 'll spend the rest of his life heartbroken . But you know , I 'm a little worried about this plan . I mean , what if the scary movie isn 't scary enough ? Yeah . The problem with scary movies is you know they 're not real . It 's a flawed genre . What if we go over there and make it real ? They 'll be naked by 9 : 30 . That 's right . Here we are , Strudwick . Pull over . All right , Mary . You can do your business here . I would have preferred a rest stop , Dick . And I want to live on Big Rock Candy Mountain , Mary . Remember ... I know . " Fantastic hurry . " I don 't blame Alissa . How could she resist marrying into the Solomons ? But Tommy with your daughter ? Is this some kind of science experiment that got out of hand ? I always knew that boy of yours would walk off with something from my house . I figured it 'd be something from my curio cabinet . If Tommy really wanted to hurt me , he could have just jumped off a bridge . At least that wouldn 't have hurt me . What 's gotten into them ? Alissa 's mother and I didn 't get married until we- - until we had Alissa . My God , Dick ! I think she 's- - Pregnant ? Yes ! Gun it , Vincent ! [ tires screech ] Dick ? Is there an extra map in the glove compartment ? Dick ? Dick ! [ movie music playing on TV ] Okay , they 're on the couch , but they 're not sitting very close . Get over here . Harry , listen and learn . First , I got a chain to drag against the wall . Then I got a rubber axe . Then I got tomato juice , which doubles for blood , and I got low sodium tomato juice which doubles for blood but is better for you . This isn 't scary . We gotta be subtle . Subtle ? Yeah ! Did you ever see Jaws ? Okay . The scary part was not the shark . It was the hint of the shark . The fin . Oh ! Slicin ' through the water . What , so you got something planned ? Yes , I do . Harry , that 's adorable , but you know , as a warrior , I think I know how to scare . Well , as someone who 's always scared , I think you 're wrong . Oh , really ? [ screaming from TV ] This movie 's pretty scary . Yeah , yeah . But notice that all of the people that haven 't been killed yet are in committed relationships with all their ups and downs . [ thud ] [ thud ] Not so tight . Being in-laws was bad enough . But my blood intermingling with yours in the veins of this spawn ? It 's unholy . Go faster , Dick . I only want to jump out of this car once . Oh , no . No sweet embrace of death for you , Vincent . Like it or not , we 're gonna be grandparents together . Well , if that 's the case , I wanna be called " Pop-pop " . I wanted " Pop-pop . " You snooze , you lose , Dick . " Pop-pop . " That 's me . That 's not fair . Take " Gramps " or " Gee-Gaw . " " Gee-Gaw ? " [ stammering ] You just made that up ! Mary , have you ever heard of " Gee- - " Mary ? Was she with us when we got that pecan roll ? No , I don 't think so . Good God , Dick ! We left her at Mile Marker 20 ! [ groans ] She should have said something . She 's unstable . Has been ever since she took up with you . You Solomons . You specialize in destroying women . It 's the talk of the town . " It 's the talk of the town . " I hate your voice , I hate your face , I hate your glasses , I hate the men who made your glasses , I hate- - Look out for that deer ! Look out for what , honey ? [ thud ] There were two treasures in my life , Dick . The first was my daughter . The second was my economy sedan . You 've taken them both . You 're no saint , Strudwick . You 're the one who made us wear these stupid t-shirts . Our old shirts were covered in deer blood and broken glass . Oh ... Call the fashion police . You know , it 's funny . I used to bring these creamers home to Alissa . She 'd have little tea parties with her stuffed animals . They grow up quick , don 't they ? Yeah . I can remember when Tommy didn 't even know how to wipe his own butt . Then he figured it out all on his own ... and taught me . You 're right , Strudwick . They do grow up too fast . This one 's on you . Dick- - No , no , no . I insist . Dick , I don 't have any cash . I paid for the motel . There 's only $ 20 in Mary 's purse , and you made me spend that on the t-shirts . There 's only one thing to do , Dick . Dine and dash . Timing is everything . Wait for my signal . They 're onto us . Relax . Anything else ? Now ! [ sighs ] We did it your way . And you know who got terrified ? Me . Tommy and Alissa are farther apart than ever . What could I say ? I was hoping you 'd bleed more . Now we 're gonna try it my way . Birdseed ? That 's not scary . Plus , you 'll attract every bird in the neighborhood . Exactly . We 'll feed ' em a lot at first . But then bit by bit , we 'll pull back . First we 'll get ' em hooked , and then we 'll get ' em pissed . Yeah , and then slowly we 'll start to replace the seed with human flesh . That is not bad . All right . How soon do you think they 'll come ? Maybe tonight . Maybe six months . Maybe never . But they 'll come . As God as my witness , they 'll come . Yeah , that 's a great idea . You know what ? While we 're waiting for your birds , I hope you don 't mind if I get a jump on my next scare tactic . Go right ahead . Why are you putting that on me ? Well , I don 't want to light my head on fire . Alissa ? Does your streetlight sometimes look like a flaming , disembodied head ? Oh , Tommy . I 've missed your sense of humor . You know , I went out with some other boys after we broke up , but don 't be mad . It could be swamp gas . Are we near a swamp ? But nobody was like you . I 've decided to forgive you . [ knock on door ] I 'm a guest . You should get that . Officer Don . Hello , Alissa . Tommy . I 'm here on official business . Alissa ... we found your father 's car on the interstate , crashed and covered with blood . Oh , my God ! Do you mind ? I 'm not done yet . In addition , we found a dead deer not far from the car . This is horrible . So my dad hit a deer ? Slow down , Nancy Drew . That 's one explanation . Another is a tri-county murder spree with your dad at the center . What does that have to do with a dead deer ? Even a deer can be a witness . Maybe it saw something and paid the price . [ police radio chatter , indistinct ] Orville . Go . [ radio chatter , indistinct ] 10-4 . Your father was spotted checking into a motel with a psycho wearing a tight t-shirt and carrying a purse . So my dad 's okay ? He 's alive ? Yes . But my cop nose tells me that there 's an ugliness spreading throughout this town . No one is safe . See ya . Oh , Tommy . I 'm so scared . Yeah , you should be . [ phone rings ] Hello ? Solomon ! Strudwick ! [ truck approaching ] I 'm gonna kill you ! [ truck honks horn ] I think that 's the person that 's gonna kill us . Dick , my toothbrush is wet . Did you brush your teeth with it ? No , I did not ... brush my teeth ... with your toothbrush . Well , let 's try and get some sleep . I never want to think about this day again . Which part don 't you want to think about most ? Our abandonment of Mary ? Our collision with that deer ? Or your coming epiphany that I 'm a nocturnal spooner ? 'Cause it 's all too much for me . I can 't take it any more . Dick , stop thinking about yourself . Try thinking about our kids . They 've got no education , no jobs , no homes to live in . You 're right . They have nothing . They 're screwed . Our only choice is to write them off . It 's not that simple . There 's going to be a baby . A baby . So pure . So small . So not-so-screwed-up yet . It 's a lot of work . It takes a village , you know . Yeah , but don 't you see ? We have a shot with a grandkid . It 's the next generation . Nature 's do-over . I don 't know . Just picture it . That first magical moment . You 're holding your perfect grandchild in your arms . He looks into your eyes , reaches up with his tiny fingers , touches your grizzly red stubble ... and says , " I wuv you Pop-pop . " We can make this work . I propose a toast . All right . To our grandchild . To our grandchild . May he or she inherit the best from both grandfathers . All right , dirtbags ! You 're gonna get what 's coming to you ! Don 't shoot ! We 're gonna have a baby ! Thanks for stopping . [ Man ] You got enough room back there ? Yeah , whatever . At least your night is over . Still not naked . Nothing 's working . Hey , what if I do an eerie dance of death ? No , it 's too artsy . I still say we stick with the classics , okay ? We have three options left . We can re-animate a dead person , pop out of Alissa 's stomach , or go in after them with a power tool . Let 's meet half way , okay ? 'Cause I 'm doing the dance of death . No , it 's not scary ! But ... I 'll do it with a power tool . What is it ? I don 't know . [ trimmer whirring ] Tommy , I 'm really scared . In these movies , the maniac 's always after the girl . It 's true . He is always after the girl . Here 's the girl ! Let 's work together ! Harry ! You were terrific ! We did it ! They 're hugging ! Actually , he 's being a little rough . But I guess that 's Tommy 's style . So you swear to me you never saw that deer before ? No . I 'm keeping the case open . There 's our honeymooners . Can 't keep their hands off each other . Thank God you 're here ! Tommy , I know I 've shown you nothing but contempt , but I love you . Welcome to the family . [ Tommy ] There 's something out there ! I want to feel the baby kick . The what ? She 's not pregnant ! But there 's something evil outside ! Not pregnant ? No ! Vincent , are you as devastated as I am ? Frankly , Dick , I 'm kind of relieved . I 'm telling you we 're not safe ! Are you abandoning me ? We were in this together . We were in bed . I was vulnerable . Screw you , Pop-pop ! In your eye , Gee-gaw ! Will you people shut up ? We 're in horrible danger ! What 's all the commotion , everybody ? Anybody need any help ? Did you guys see ? There 's something out there . It 's terrifying . Which part of the terror did you find most romantic ? Romantic ? He tried to sacrifice me to the creature . She called us " The Creature . " Our work is done . Look , it 's been a long night of dashed dreams and close calls . The important thing is that we 're all safe and sound . And no one has been harmed . Why did you leave me ! [ all screaming ] It 's her ! It 's the creature ! [ all screaming ] I 'll be damned if Strudwick becomes a grandfather before I do . Oh , Tommy ! Look ! There 's one waiting for the bus . She 's the perfect mate . Hey , you ! Bus girl ! What is the attraction about being a grandfather anyway ? Grandchildren are vessels of youth , optimism , and hope . And the wonderful thing is by the time they screw up their lives , your either dead or completely out if it . People don 't say that enough . Tommy , look ! There 's another prospect ! That 's Dubczek . Oh . Man , she fools you from behind . Closed-Captioned by J.R. Media Services , Inc . Burbank , CA

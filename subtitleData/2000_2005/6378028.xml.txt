 Xhalax ! Go on , do it . Believe me , nothing would give me greater pleasure . But I kill you , and another Retrieval Squad will already be on its way . Unless ... I report you terminated . In which case , you free me here and now and you disappear forever . You forget who 's in charge here . ( grunts ) I 'll tell you what 's going to happen . You go back to High Command . You tell them I can deliver Talyn and Moya . They can have the escaped prisoners . They can even have Crichton if they want . And in return ? Two things . I want Aeryn . Oh Crais , you 're so predictable . I want Aeryn ! And I want to be a Peacekeeper again . Is that what you think ? Is that what you think happened , Crichton ? You were there ? No , actually I was busy trying to save Aeryn and Talyn while you were cutting deals to save yourself . You know the truth . You know I 'll never again be a Peacekeeper . Never say never again , 007 . That 's all I know . Still no news of Moya ? Nothing resembling a Leviathan for a million metras . Well surely the Peacekeepers will send another Retrieval Squad to come looking for her ? Actually looking for Crais . So you really should do the noble thing and jump ship before you get us all killed . They 're hunting Talyn as well . ( eerie oscillating tone ) I ... I ... I can 't . You got a problem with your head gear ? Talyn 's signals ... confused . What the gletch is happening ? Happening at full speed , I can feel it . Talyn is fighting with himself . Crais , pull him back . I can 't control him . Hey guys , we are flying into a sun . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Yazhnek shakrow aeilo ... Knock it off , pop-top . Crais , get on the headset and get us outta here . Talyn 's doing everything he can to fight against it . Against what ? The sun 's emitting unusual pulses of radiation , attracting Talyn and compelling him to fly directly into the sun . So un-compel him . Stop him . Knock him out . Disconnect him . It 's too late for that ! Yazhnek ... - Shut up , Stark . Crais : We 're going in ! Talyn ! - Talyn ! ( yelling ) - Talyn ! What the frell ? Talyn has pulled away . Saved us . And we 're supposed to be grateful ? He 's now orbiting the sun . The shields are holding , but there are parts of Talyn I can 't see or feel . Crichton : We 're gonna have to do a manual survey for damage . All right . Crais , you should stay up here in this section . The rest of us will divide up the ship amongst us . Ohh ! Oh . Crais , we 're on Tier Two . Crichton : I 'd say that 's a damaged area . The secondary control node and it is ... completely blown . You know , Talyn has got a hog of a power plant but he 's got a piss poor electrical system . He sneezes and half of his circuits fry . He hasn 't fully healed from the Retrieval Squad attack . Yeah , I know that . I still say he could use some heavy-duty wiring . He 's still young . He 'll get much stronger as he develops . Not if he flies into any more stars he won 't . How big is he going to get , anyway ? Is he going to be Moya 's size ? Well , Crais seems to think so . Damn ! - Here . There . Be careful . Yeah . ( echoing voice ) : Are you there ? Talyn , is that you ? Are you there ? Hello ? Talyn ? You know , for someone who used to look down her nose at tech work , you 're pretty damn good at this . Well , perhaps people can change . Well , at least some people are smiling around here these days . Yeah , I know . It suits your face . I was talking about you . Me ? I 'm not smiling . Yes , you are . Pay attention to your work . Right . Focus on the work . And don 't do that . I 'm working here . Stop distracting me . I 'm distracting you ? Yes , you are always distracting me . Well then you are easily distracted . No , I 'm not . - Yes , you are . I 'm not . - Oh , really . Okay , that 's a little distracting . And it 's something I did ? Could be . What , something like ... this ? ( chuckles ) You said pay attention to the work . You 're right . I 'm sorry . I won 't distract you any further . Crichton : You have a problem ? No , I don 't have a problem . No ? Uh-uh . You 're not distracted ? What are we doing ? Better question , why now ? What ? What the hell is that ? Crais , Talyn is leaking some kinda ... Oh , I see you 've got it in here too . As far as I can tell , the mist is exuding from a dozen points on three tiers . You know what it is ? - Drexim . A synaptic fluid naturally occurring in Talyn 's conduits . Uh-huh . Why is it steaming from the walls ? When it becomes acidic , it can erode the seals joining the conduits . That is a beautiful design , Crais . Tell me , is this stuff affecting you ? No . But it seems to have made Rygel permanently hungry . Has it been affecting you or Aeryn ? What exactly does it do to Talyn ? When he 's in danger , it increases the stimulus , increasing his response rates . Right . So it 's like adrenaline . Adrenaline in humans , when we get in a tight spot , makes us fight . And , uh ... do other things . It 's not gonna affect us the same way , is it ? Well , possibly . But the effects should be manageable . Should ... be manageable ? Look , Crais , before ah , we all go crackers ... Hey baby , how ya doin ' ? ... maybe we should get some space suits , masks or something ? I 've already thought of that . We 're too late . The drexim has reached the suits and it 's made all the seals dissolve . Then what are we gonna do if it increases ? We ignore it , and we do what we have to do . Is that clear ? Oh , aye , Captain . Yes , sir . ( echoing voice ) : Can you hear me ? Talyn ? Can you hear me ? Are you there ? I know how you 're feeling , Talyn . I saw you . I felt you wanted to die . What is this , Talyn ? Please ... ( gasping ) : Who are you ? ! You can see me . I am Sierjna . This room , this room ... I haven 't seen this room before . But you can see me ? And hear me ? Of course I can . You 're there in front of me . I am ? Full formed ? Visible ? Vabaseena ! You can help me ! What ... what do you want ? This room , this room , this room , this room ... I seek the Pilot . I 've never seen this room before . I may say the same about this ship . In part , it appears Leviathan , and yet not . This ship is Talyn . It is a hybrid . It is part Leviathan , part gunship . Then where is the Pilot ? He should be here . There is no Pilot . There has never been a Pilot . There is always a Pilot . But ... never one who could see ... hear ... feel me . Until now . How did you get on board this ship ? I ... I kanished . You were in my zone . In your zone ? I don 't understand . How did you get on board this ship ? Cycles ago , I came from Dall-fer-yon . One microt I was on my ship , and then not . I 'm trapped , outside my world for so long trying to get back . But I float here , unable to free myself . I board a Leviathan , then another , then another , only to find myself unseen , unheard by all aboard . Until now . Where at last , I am given form . Finally I find those who can help me . Please , only you can save me . As I suspected , Talyn is overproducing drexim due to the stress he 's under . The radiation pulse is still compelling him to move towards the sun . He is resisting , barely . We 're maintaining orbit and we 're not getting any closer . We 're not getting any further away either . How do we pry this boy loose ? Can we stick cotton in his ears ? Crais , is there a way to filter out these pulses ? His shields are linked to his sensors to inform him of ambient conditions . So , cut the link . That would blind him . Get him some sunglasses , Blue Blockers . Perhaps we could recalibrate his shields to block out that one pulse spectrum . Well we might be able to if the shield overrides were functioning . Where 's the fault ? Secondary control node . ( alarm blaring ) Talyn , intruder ! I want to help you . They all say that . This unusual vessel . Is it a Leviathan ? Who wants to know ? I am Mu-Quillus . You are in great danger . If this is a Leviathan , you must abandon ship immediately . Why ? Your ship has been caught by a Siren Star . Inevitably , it will succumb . Like the 83 Leviathans that have already died here . So , this sun has claimed over 80 Leviathans ? Yes . Please get to your life pods while you still can . I don 't understand how this vessel has lasted this long . Talyn is a hybrid Leviathan built for combat , with much tougher shielding . And weapons , I see . Who built it ? How ' bout you tell us first ? How did you get here ? You just beamed in ? I transmuted . I 'm something of a hybrid myself . Able to switch between a matter and an energy state . That 's how I can exist in the star 's corona . So , you live here ? I find the unusual spectrum of the Siren Star quite pleasing . Crichton : Or maybe you just like watching Leviathans dive in and burn up . Perhaps you caused them to do so . A Siren Star 's pulse radiation is a perfectly natural phenomenon . It 's not by fault that it attracts Leviathans to it . I try to warn them , as I 'm warning you . But until now , they have always perished before I could do so . I don 't believe you . How severely damaged are you ? How closely did you approach before it pulled away ? And I don 't like all these questions . Leave this ship . I 'm only trying to help . Get off this ship now ! Talyn ! You 'd be wise to listen to me . Damn , Crais , you 're gettin a bit trigger happy . I ordered him to leave . He wouldn 't obey . So you killed him ? What if he was trying to help ? Cat lives in the corona of a star , Crais . You think you 're gonna take him out with a couple of pulse blasts ? He 's gone for the moment . We 've bought some time . Let 's use it . Get back to the conduits . Yes , Dad . Sierjna : We must fly away , quickly Before he discovers I am here . Who ? Mu-Quillus . My saviour , my captor . A being like yourself ? No , not like me , another species . He inhabited this star before I came . When my Leviathan perished , he kept me from dying . He claims that he saw me and had to save me . He says that he 's in love with me but I don 't love him and I never will . He murdered my ship and all its passengers ! He did that ? ! He 's still doing it . That 's why he 's here , to lure Leviathans to their doom . Why ? He was contracted to , by the Prahtikrah , a race of shipbuilders who see Leviathans as competition . The more Leviathans disappear ... The more ships they can sell . Yes ! - That 's monstrous ! Crais ! Crais ! Talyn is being lured into the sun by ... Crais : By a creature named Mu-Quillus . I know that , Stark ! What I need to know is how to break free ! I don 't know . I don 't know how he 's doing it . Sorry , I can 't help you . We must break away . You don 't know what it 's like to ... to be trapped forever in the light of the sun , not to be able to feel , to touch , your only companion a monster ! Take me away from him . I want to walk on a planet again . I want to breathe its air . I want to drink its cool water . Give me back my life ! I can 't . You 've already passed beyond life . Sierjna , you perished with your shipmates . Mu-Quillus trapped your soul between realms . I 'm ... dead ? Oh , no ! No , that 's not true . I ... You can see me . You can touch me . Sierjna , I 'm a Stykera with certain talents . I can help you cross over to the next level . To death ? No ! No . I 'm alive . I 'm here ! I 'm real again ! You can never be real again in the way you wish . I can only ... release you . I don 't believe it . You ... this ship ... you ... you brought me back . I 'm whole again ! I won 't give that up ! Come with me . God-like aliens . Man , do I hate god-like aliens . I 'll trade a critter for a god-like alien any day . No , no . We 'll be all right , as ... as long as we stick together . Right , just not too ... close together , ' cause ... Right , yeah , yes . I-I know . I ... We 're gonna ... we 're gonna ... die ... die , die , die , die , die , die , die , if we don 't get the conduit fixed . Yeah , right ! Focus . Eyes on the task . Remember the mist . The mist is not your friend . Right . Bad mist . Naughty mist . Aeryn : Ooooh .. ( munching ) ( stomach gurgling ) ( groaning ) : Oh , that 's , that 's , that 's ... ( belches and breaks wind ) ( relieved sigh ) ( falsetto voice ) : ... better . But even for me , this is a bit excessive . ( chuckling ) Rygel . Rygel , can we talk to you ? Stay back , unless you ... I 'm back . I 'm back . ( groaning ) : Ooh ! What do you want ? I ... We just wanted to know ... " We ? " What are you talking about ? Have you gone totally fahrbot ? Who 's " we " ? You see ? It is as I said . I am the only one who can see you . Stark , I 'm too sick to witness one of your hallucinations . Sierjna : That can 't be true ! That ... Sir , noble sir ... Stark : Sierjna , don 't . He can 't hear you . He can 't see you . Yes , well I can see you , you crazy nik-nik ! Who are you talking to ? Only I can see you . Only I can hear you . Only me . I will take care of you . I promise . ( Rygel sighs disgustedly ) Right , that 's done it . He 's gone . He 's totally ... ( grunting ) ( breaking wind ) ( falsetto ) : insane . ( inhales and exhales ) No , please , no . No , this can 't be true ! I told you . You are zy-limbron , not alive . ( rumbling ) I 've come to take you home . Sierjna : No . I won 't go with you . Of course you will . You can 't stay here . I can ! I have found someone who can help me ! You know better than that . This ship is doomed . Like all the others , it will be drawn into the sun , and all on board will perish . You will come back to me . Stark : No ! Not this time ! I can free her . I am Stykera ! I have the energy . Sierjna , please , come with me . No . No . I remain here , with Stark . If that is what you wish . ( crackling ) Crichton : Mist , the mist , resist the mist . Resist the mist . Are you done ? I 'm almost done . I 'm really close . Close ? Nearly there . God , I love you . - I love you , too . Tell me when you 're done . - I 'm ... nearly done . Tell me when you 're finishing . I ... - Yeah ? Yes ? Almost ! - Yeah ? Last one . Finished ! ( Talyn rumbling ) Frell ... - Yeah . No , no , no . I mean , bad frell ! Mr. Sun still wants Talyn . Crais ! What 's with the rumble ? The radiation pulses have intensified and changed . How the hell could that happen ? - I don 't know , but they have and they 're still changing . - Shield overrides are working . I 'll try and block out the pulses . ( rumbling ) Sierjna : Listen . I know that sound . He 's luring your ship back to the sun ! No . You 'll be killed , all of you ! I 've seen it before , over and over . Sierjna ... - Every time ! Mu-Quillus was right . He 's all I have . I 'm going to be trapped with him forever . Listen to me ! I won 't let that happen . I have a plan . A plan ? Come on ! I can 't change Talyn 's course . His compulsion is stronger than ever . The pulse spectrum is shifting too quickly . I can 't block it out . The Pied Piper 's found a new tune . Explain . - Natural phenomenon , my ass ! Mu-Quillus is generating these pulses . How ? Crichton : Uh ... Orbiting boom box . He 's , uh , whistling out his butt . How the hell should I know ? ! The point is , we gotta find the source , and we-we gotta squish it . I 'm on scan . A plan , a plan . Save Talyn . A plan . Talyn , I will lead you away from danger . What are you doing ? This is a Pilot 's station . Maybe I can control Talyn from here . Guide him away from the sun . ( gasping ) Stark ! ( whimpering ) Hey , guys , I think maybe I got something here . ( rumbling ) What the frell just happened ? ( grunting ) Sierjna : Stark ! Who pulled the plug ? Crais ? Talyn ? My transponder 's dead , too . I can 't hear him . Crichton : Aeryn , overrides ? Gone . Everything 's out . Crais : Talyn , where are you ? Nothing 's responding . Talyn is gone . Stark ? No . Stark , can you hear me ? ( Stark groans ) Talyn . Talyn , I am part of you now . Ah ... I can sense all of you ! I can guide you . Stark . Hurry ! The sun ! Yes , the sun . Talyn , you will turn away . You must turn away . ( rumbling ) Talyn is turning . But how ? Everyone , we 're saved ! We 've done it ! Who has done what ? Talyn and I. We 've escaped from the sun . And we saved Sierjna from Mu-Quillus . Sierjna ? Sie ... Sierjna ... Oh , no ! We must 've gone too far . She-she couldn 't stay with us . Crichton : Stark ! What in the living hell are you talking about ? We must go back . Must find her . Aeryn : He 's turning again . Stark , are you controlling Talyn ? Yes , yes . I must . I must , I must , I must ... Crichton : Yo , Astro ! Calm down and tell me . What the hell is going on ? It 's very , very simple . I am now Talyn 's Pilot , and we are flying back into the sun . What do you mean , you 're Talyn 's Pilot ? Talyn doesn 't have a Pilot . Stark : He does now . I 've bonded with him , formed a neural link , joined with him in the Den . What Den ? - Can 't speak now . Searching for Sierjna . Must find Sierjna . Stark ? Stark , you release control of Talyn at once . Good old Stark . Count on him to jump right in and wig right out . How could he have bonded with Talyn ? Talyn must 've developed a rudimentary Pilot 's Den . Crais , I thought you bred out the need for a Pilot in Talyn . We tried to , but Leviathan biology is complex . Enough linked genes must 've remained for Talyn to grow a vestigial Pilot facility . Like an appendix ? Wait . Where is this Den ? Most likely somewhere below Tier Three . If I can 't restore the overrides , I 'll go find it myself . Fine , you do that , get his hands off the wheel . We 're gonna do something else . Sierjna ... Which one is guidance ? That one . No . No , no . Crichton : Hey Stark , did you feel that ? No . No , I can 't ... I can 't maneuver . Crichton : That 's right . You might want to hit the brakes . We just took out your steering . ( screaming ) Talyn , you listen to me ! I know you can hear me . You 're taking the wrong option . You will kill us and you will kill yourself . Come on , Stark . Talk to me . We can work this out . Yo , Astro . Talk to me . We can work it out . Lava Boy is not your friend . I am . You okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm alright . Thanks for watching my backside . Couldn 't help myself . Stark , you listen to me now . You try anything like that again and I will personally take you to the other side . ( groans in frustration ) ( muffled whine ) Talyn , I am trying to help you . All the lower decks are sealed off . I can 't get into the Den to free you from the Banik slave . That 's it , Talyn . Bypass the primary guidance system . Yes , that 's it . Careful ! We don 't want them finding out what we 're doing . Talyn , you listen to me ! I am trying to save you . Talyn ! ( beeping ) Crichton : Hey , Stark . Talk to me . You getting lonely up there ? You like being alone ? Don 't think he 's listening . No . But it 's not good to be alone ? No , it 's not . Maybe we should go find him . And leave these conduits unattended ? He 'll send up another DRD to repair it all . Yeah , and lead us like a moth to the flame . Let Stark make the first move . You know what 's he 's like . He doesn 't have much patience . Right . We have , uh , all the time in the world . No need to rush . You comfortable ? Mm-hmm . Aeryn , this is the mist talking . I like what it 's saying . So do I , but we gotta ... we gotta focus . I 'm doing my job . Corridor is all clear . So it 's just you and me . Just you and me . Stark : Slower , slower Talyn . That 's it . Mustn 't let you get too close , just close enough . Sierjna : Stark ? ( gleeful scream ) - Stark ! Sierjna ! But you got away . You were free . I came back for you . No . No , you 're risking everything . Nothing else matters . I told you I would save you and I will , even if it takes my own life . Stark ... - I will take you , I will walk you to the other side . Do you trust me ? Mu-Quillus will kill you . Do you trust me ? ! Yes . Are you ready ? I 'm frightened . Don 't be frightened . No need . Come closer . I 'm ready . Thank you . Nah vahajma , nah vaheerma ... I will find you in the next life . You 're still here . I have neither moved nor changed . It 's not working . Why is it not working ? ( Rygel groaning ) Are you still eating ? Oh , stop me , Crais . Make me stop . Shoot me ! Do something , please ! Here , here , tie my hands . Yes ! - I need your help . No , no , no , no , no . Tie my hands now , or I 'm going to explode . ( stomach rumbles loudly ) Ah , this is all your fault ! This is your gunship . Peacekeepers designed it and you can 't control it . But I can control you now . ( gasping ) : You press that into me and I 'm going to vomit all over you . Stark is a mutineer . He 's also out of his frelling mind . Came in here , had a conversation with that wall . Must be the mist making him see things . Rygel , Stark has taken control of Talyn . He must be flushed out so I can take back command . Well , go ahead . I need your help , slug . Please let me eat that little piece , please . Now you listen to me . Talyn has sealed all the entrances to his Den , but maybe you , being so small , can slip through a ventilation duct . ( laughing ) : Look at me . Look at my stomachs . I 'm not slipping through any ducts . I am your captain . You 're not my captain . This is a direct order . - Dream on ! If you don 't obey my orders ... - Yes , this mist isn 't affecting you , huh ? If you do not obey my orders right now and go into the Pilot 's Den and flush out the Banik , I will shoot you as a mutineer . ( gasping ) As you wish . Crais , come here . Why ? Closer . It 's a secret . If you try anything ... Closer . ( loud crunching ) ( screaming ) ( Rygel laughing ) Rygel ! I don 't understand it . You ... It ... It should 've worked . ( loud rumbling ) Let her go . If we try again ... Nothing will happen . Why do you think she never crossed over in the first place ? What do you think is keeping her between the realms ? Me . My power . You had your chance to escape . You might have saved your ship , your crew , your own life . But you returned . You have me back Mu-Quillus . You can let them go . No . It is not for me to make that decision . My task is set . The ship will continue to the sun . Sierjna . Come with me . Stark : No , no ! Sierjna ... Stark : Don 't do it ! No , you must . Wait , Sierjna ! Don 't go ! ( rumbling ) Oh , no . No , no , no , Talyn , please ! Fight it ! Fight it ! Turn away ! Turn away , please , Talyn ! No ! Talyn , please turn away ! Stark ! Everyone ... I 'm sorry . Talyn is once more being drawn into the sun . The lure is stronger than ever , and Talyn can 't fight it and I can 't stop him . So , I suggest you prepare yourselves for peace . Because I have failed you , and we 're all going to die . All we can do now is wait . I 'm not letting you go . I 'm never letting you go . Wait a microt . What ? This is wrong . God , the mist ... the damn mist is messing with our heads . That 's why we 're giving up . I 'm not giving up . I never give up . Okay , I 'm gonna go to the bridge . I 'm gonna to tear it apart . I 'm gonna to find something . Okay . The same with Crais and Stark . You tear ' em apart , baby . All right , listen . I don 't want to lose you either . Can we definitely get back to that later ? Oh , God , I love you . I love you , too . ( Crais grunting ) Crais , what are you ... I can 't get in ! Talyn will not comply with my orders ! And the drexim it 's obviously driven him insane . Blast your way in . Yes . Give me your gun . Perhaps not . Do not question my decisions ! I am your captain ! And I order you ! I am your captain ! I order you ! All right , Phantom , new tune for the opera . Stark ( muttering ) : Sierjna 's gone . I 've failed her . Failed her . Failed Aeryn . Failed you , Crichton . Yes , and you have failed gloriously , Stark . And I want you to fail again . I want you to give me control of the consoles . I want you to give me some control . She came to me for help . Not many do , but ... I could have done more . Stark , I am coming to you for help . You are gonna give me control or I am gonna rip off the other side of your damn face ! There 's nothing you can do , Crichton . We 're going to be lured into that sun and we 're all going to die inside there . That 's because the bastard is luring us in , Stark. okay ? He 's got bait and we can cut bait . We 've got a mother of a cannon . I want you to give me back control . I was zeroing in on the damn power source when you turned out the lights . You remember when we met ? You want to take a trip down memory lane ? Stark ! My side , your side , my side , your side , my side , your side . I tried to help you then , but I failed . Scorpius put a chip in your brain . I failed . Stark , blow the damn Aurora Chair . Let 's talk about the good times , huh ? Do you remember Zhaan , Stark ? Let 's talk about Zhaan . I tried to help her , but I couldn 't . Well she would piss on your grave right now . You wanna know why ? My soulmate . Because Aeryn is my Zhaan . She 's my Zhaan in every way . I love her , and I would die for her . And you know what , Stark ? You 're killing her . What ? Me ? You 're killing her you freakazoid , psycho bastard . You are killing my Zhaan ! Yeah . Aha . Hi . - Hi . I got some control back . Let me show ya . I love it when you take control . This is drexim talking . No , it isn 't . I can manually prime the cannon . I 'd love to see that . Talyn 's cannon . I 'm stoked , not stupid . Do it . We 've only got one chance with it , John . We 're too close to the star . We 've got one chance . Whoa , whoa , whoa , hey . Check this out . A throbbing pulse of energy coming straight into your living room . I got it . Stark , are you still there ? You 're just like Zhaan in so many ways . If you say so . I am going to manually prime the main cannon . Crichton has located a target . Please prepare Talyn to fire . Would Zhaan approve of this use of violence ? She 's speaking through me now . It is her wish . No . You 're risking everything . - You 're back . You 're too close . Don 't do this for me . I 'm not . Mu-Quillus has Talyn mesmerized . Stop what you 're doing . Is there some kind of stupid alien quotation book you guys use ? A deal between us can be brokered . Lava Boy , you are losing . A compromise assures your survival . Again with the quote book . Hey , quote me on this . We 're gonna blow up your fuse box . I 'll release my grip on your vessel . And in return ? Go away . He 's gonna give us our freedom in exchange for his . Leave us to our own . What about other Leviathans you 'll encounter ? Why should that concern you ? That was the wrong answer . Sorry . Stark ? Talyn . It is time . Power down your weapons . I can offer you better terms . Crichton : Damn , Smoky ! You can 't argue with a woman . ( Mu-Quillus screaming ) Sierjna ! Now ... Nah vahajma , nah vaheerma , beker del rais . Crais : This apparatus was not designed for any species but a Pilot 's . What you did was beyond foolish , Stark . Hold still . You cut me . You moved . ( grunts ) Talyn is now off-limits to you . All functions , all programs , all controls . I know . You know nothing . I know how he feels , what he thinks , about everything . About you . Talyn was not of his right mind . Anything you think you experienced must take that into consideration . I know . Even if you slit my throat , I will still know . Most of Talyn 's internal systems are back on-line , and his drexim levels have returned to normal . ( groaning ) I wish my levels were returning to normal . Next Commerce Planet you are restocking the galley . You ate everything . I never , ever want to even look at food again . ( groaning ) Must go to chamber . Need sleep . Vomit . Out of my way ! How 's it going ? He 's recovering well . He 's a remarkable vessel . Speaking of ... remarkable vessels . How is the secondary control node ? I got a chain gang of DRDs working on it . Everything will be up and running in a couple of days . We were very lucky . Well , I think that , uh ... Fates would have brought us together anyway . You know , Crais is going to be cutting Stark free for about an arn . Rygel 's going to take at least that long . He 's got three stomachs .

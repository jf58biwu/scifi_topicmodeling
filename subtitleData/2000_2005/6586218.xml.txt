 Yeah , dudes ! Welcome to your Dumb Ass Show . I am your Sky Commander Winky . - And this is the beautiful Captain Dare ! - Yeah , baby ! Whoo-hoo ! - The biggest dumb-ass I know ! - Thank you , Sky Commander . Yes , Captain Dare will show you what a dumb-ass he really is . But be forewarned . Only a stupid dumb-ass would neglect to take every safety precaution in the stunts you are about to witness . Now , the physics alone took almost five minutes of calculation . Oh ! Yes ! Yeah , dude . Fire when ready ! Oh , mother ... What the ... Ohhh ! And that 's a dumb-ass ! Oh , right in the ... Hey , Natalie , come here . How about a kiss for good luck ? - Bill , why are you doing this ? - His name 's Captain Dare ! And he 'll be famous one day for going where no dudes have gone before . If you won 't give me a kiss , how about throwing me a magazine ? Dah ! Oh , yeah ! Whoo-hoo ! Hey ! Hey ! That is it ! Whoo ! There it is ! There it is ! Yes ! That is a dumb-ass ! That is a dumb-ass ! Whoo-hoo ! I 'm the man ! I 'm the man ! What up ? Come here ! You want some dirt on you ? And now the awesome Captain Dare will make Dumb Ass history in the scientifically modified shopping cart of doom . Rolling down this hill , hitting the launch ramp at an estimated 24.6 miles an hour , sailing just over the scrumptious Natalie Gordon , who will be holding this flaming torch in her mouth . - I didn 't say I was going to do anything . - This is the money shot . Captain , tell her . - What could go wrong ? - " What could go wrong ? " You mean besides landing on me and crushing my head ? It 'll be killer . The Captain will jump , her torch will set the cart on fire . And our daring hero rolling on to salvation in the pool of life , triumphant . Natalie , come on . Just do it for me . Please ? - Please ? - You can do it , Natalie ! You 're gonna freakin ' fly , man . This is gonna be big . You can do this . - You are the man . Show ' em , dumb-ass ! - I 'm the man ! I 'm the man . Captain Dumb-Ass , comin ' down ! What up ! Oh ! No , no ! Hey ! Bill ! Now that 's a dumb-ass ! Come on , Bill , get up . Hey , Bill . Hey , Bill . - Thanks for coming . - Are you the medical examiner ? Yes , I 'm Dr Fountain . You 're the experts from the FBI ? - " The experts " ? - I was told you were the experts . We work on the X-Files . Our expertise is the unexplained . We were told you had an unexplained death . You 're the experts . You tell me . Why don 't you explain what happened ? Well , I can 't . That 's the point . - You can 't tell us anything ? - I 'd prefer not to go on record . - Why is that ? - The kid 's parents are suing everyone . - For what ? - Everything . The county for making the street too steep , the supermarket he stole the cart from , the company that made the helmet he was wearing . Off the record , Doc , what the hell has that got to do with a supermarket shopping cart ? - You familiar with The Dumb Ass Show ? - The Dumb Ass Show ? A cable TV show . A lot of kids act like dumb-asses . - They tape themselves doing stunts . - This was an accident ? I 'd prefer not to get sucked into a legal nightmare here . You investigate the unexplained . How about you explain it to me ? Dr Fountain , do you see this ? - What the hell is that ? - You 're asking me ? - Thanks for coming so quickly . - Your message said " urgent " . - What am I looking at ? - We hoped you could tell us . Is she the expert ? Well , what do you think ? Well , I have to say that ... I have never seen anything quite like this before . Something killed this kid . Judging from the amount of insect faeces in the ear and nasal cavities , they fed at such a furious rate that it caused the boy 's skull to collapse from the inside . His helmet protected his head during the crash . There is no impact trauma here . You 're saying flies killed him ? Of all the kids at the scene , flies choose to attack this boy . Why ? Maybe they were attracted for reasons we 're not seeing . What if somebody put something in his helmet ? Insect pheromone . Spanish Fly , that stuff you see advertised in magazines that guys use to attract girls . I glance at ' em for amusement . I may have to brush up on my Spanish Fly , but I don 't think the science works that way . Before we look for an M0 , I wanna find out what kind of fly would act that aggressively . The musca vetustissima Walker , the Australian bush fly . It craves protein so much , it will crawl into your open nose , mouth , ears , even your eyes , to feed on blood and moisture . Though the New Zealand screwworm fly often kills its victims in mere moments by burrowing into an open wound or cut . I 'm sorry . I 'm Dr Rocky Bronzino . Hi . Rocky Bronzino . Hello there . Rocky Bronzino . Field entomological expert , Rutgers University , at your service . - Dr Bronzino ... - Rocky . Neither of these flies are indigenous to North America . Are you suggesting this is a virulent foreign vector ? No . The specimens you collected are your garden-variety calliphorid , harmless as , well ... flies . - What are you suggesting , then ? - Nothing . Dr Fountain brought me in for my scientific expertise and , I must say , I 'm glad he did . Dr Bronzino , you should know we may be looking at a murder . A murder ? Are there any suspects ? Natalie Gordon , the lady in Captain Dare 's short life and the last person to see him alive . - Leave me alone , Winky . - It 's for the memorial video . For a fallen hero . Just a few words for Captain Dare . You want a few words , Winky ? You 're a jerk , and 50 's your brother , for making Bill do all those stupid stunts . Hey , Captain Dare died doing what he loved , pushing the envelope . Maybe if you weren 't such a ... Hey , you . Freaky-Deaky . You want your own memorial , huh ? You wanna be in Dumb Ass ? Just leave her alone . I 'm talking to you now , freak . David Winkle ! In my office , right now ! Typical . Lokensgard 's gonna have his mommy stick up for him . Baby . That is it ! Whoo ! There it is ! I just solved this case . This kid had crap for brains . The flies couldn 't resist . And you were a choirboy growing up ? We did stupid stuff , but we didn 't know it was stupid . This isn 't just stupid . This is glorification of stupid . These kids take enormous pride in being sub-mental . That 's why they call it Dumb Ass . - Mr David Winkle . - Sky Pilot Winky . Just the man we wanna see . Come on in . - It 's very entertaining , Sky Pilot . - Sky Commander , if you don 't mind . You can call me Sheriff John when I haul your dumb ass off to jail . - What are you talkin ' about ? - We have a copy of a recent email you sent , offering the video of your friend 's death to the Fox network . No , I wrote all the networks . Fox were the only one who had any interest in it . I don 't think you understand . What , you think I killed him ? You think I 'd kill Captain Dare to make money ? My best friend ? You were the last person to have contact with him . You gave him his helmet at the top of the hill . I think you put something in it . Agh ! - Sit down , Sky Commander . - I can 't ! I 'm being attacked ! Oh , God , it 's happening to me . Now that 's a dumb-ass ! Where you been ? Dinner 's been on the table almost an hour . I 'm not hungry . Then you sit down here until you get hungry . Dylan ? I have something to talk to you about . Dylan ? Dylan ? Dylan ? I 'm glad you 're here . I think we just got our first break . - What 'd you find ? - It 's what Rocky Bronzino found . The flies that ate at the brain and the skull of the victim are all female . Every last one . Exactly how is that a break ? What are the chances of that ? You mean the absence of males suggests a reason for the attack , behaviourally ? Something biological is going on , hormonal or chemical , that caused these bugs to attack . - Or a need to express themselves . - Say what ? The kid that calls himself Sky Commander Winky . Agent Reyes and I were interviewing him as a suspect when this happened . Paramedics arrived and treated him for an aggressive attack of body lice . Lice are not uncommon in a school environment . Except that these are better spellers than most of the kids . - So is this just another Dumb Ass stunt ? - That was my first thought . But the victim was too freaked out to make me believe he 'd staged this . Which leads me to think that while you may be right about this being biology , someone is directing the biology . How does one direct bugs ? I don 't know how , but we 've been running down a long list of witnesses . A loner who was present at every Dumb Ass stunt , who had a run-in with this kid Winky at school before the lice attack . His name is Dylan Lokensgard . We want to talk to him , He 's just not well . He 's unable to talk . Dylan ? Dylan ? I wanna have a talk with you . Honey , can you come out here ? Dylan ? Dylan ? Dylan ! - Where are you going ? - To school , I know where you 're going . - What did Natalie want ? - Stay away from her . She 's no good for you . - She 's trouble . - We 've been friends since we were kids . But you 're not kids any more , which is why we need to talk . You 're going through changes . Your body is going through changes . You don 't understand anything . I don 't wanna talk to you . I wish Dad was still here . You know nothing about me . Honey , I want what 's best for you . Dylan , come back here ! Dylan ! So many flowers ... so little time . - Excuse me ? - Pheromones , Dr Scully . Heavy in the air . Nature 's natural attractants , driving the insect world to go forth and pollinate . I 'm aware how pheromones work , but according to this there are no pheromones here . Well , that can 't be right . The biosensor we use is an actual fly antenna , over which the pheromones pass , but I modified the EAG to measure in picograms , making it sensitive to traces a mile in any direction . I 'm still not sure why you think pheromones might cause a harmless fly to attack a human so violently , Doctor . Rocky . Rocky . Bugs are small-minded creatures and therefore very predictable . They don 't have moods per se . They react to circumstance and stimuli , as they have been doing it for millennia . So what do you suppose they 're reacting to out here ? It may be the bugs are being somehow driven crazy with desire . You know , they say we humans respond to pheromones too . - Yeah , I tend to agree with that . - Women 's dormitory syndrome . Pheromones are the reason that women who live together share the same menstrual cycle . - Fascinating . - You know , when a male and female calliphorid fly mate , they are joined for up to one and a half hours . One and a half , Doctor . You know , Rocky ... I 'm a mother . Mothers are women too . - Big hit ! - What is it ? A high concentration of C-13 calliphorone . Incoming . - Natalie ! - Agh ! Dylan ? - Are you all right ? - I 'm fine . - What about your bike ? - I 'll get it later . - I came by your house to see you . - Oh , really ? Your mom made it sound like something was wrong with you . Me ? No , I 'm fine . What did you want ? I wanted to apologize about what happened yesterday at the cafeteria . Winky can be such a jerk . I was just worried about you . What did I say ? Nothing . No one understands . My mom and dad think it 's just gonna go away . What I 'm feeling . You mean about Bill ? I wish you could just turn back time . I wish you could just make everything go away , and start all over again . I know , like when we were kids . You remember that night when we played hide-and-seek on your street ? Manhunt . We hid in the tree together . Our names are still carved in it . I 'm ... I 'm gonna be late . Dylan Lokensgard ? Can you come with us , Dylan ? And now the awesome Captain Dare will make " Dumb Ass " history ... - Why are you showing me this ? - What do you think of it ? You mean The Dumb Ass Show ? That and the kids who make it . I know ' em , you know ? You ever had contact with Bill , the kid who played Captain Dare ? No . - You have anything against him ? - No . Do you think it 's strange that he was attacked and killed by insects ? Who wouldn 't ? - What 's going on ? - We 're talking to Dylan . Oh , no , you 're not . Dylan . No one interrogates my son in my office without my permission . - Calm down , Mrs Lokensgard . - He 's not a part of that crowd . - What are you accusing him of ? - We 're just trying to see what he knows . - He doesn 't know anything . - He was at the crime scene . So were a lot of kids . Dylan ... Too late , gentlemen . The bugs are gone . Bugs are all gone . Whatever . - How 's he doing ? - He 's unhurt , apparently . Not so much as a single bite on him . Mrs Lokensgard . I don 't think we 've finished talking to Dylan . Yes , you have . We 're going home . I 've said it before . This case is attracting files because somebody 's full of crap . I think what we just saw was a show . Dylan caused the bugs to attack him to make himself look like a victim , not the perpetrator . OK , but how ? This guy 's a horse whisperer only for bugs ? I don 't know how he 's doing it , but I may know a way to find out . - Where did you get this ? - Dylan gave it to us during his interview . There 's typically not a lot to be found in a teenage boy 's sweaty Kleenex . You 're looking for pheromones . Aren 't they in adolescent sweat ? Yes , it 's what causes BO . But obviously it 's not all that attractive - to anything . I 've got a reading going right off the scale . Holy Toledo . We got pheromones coming out the Yin-Yang here . C-13 calliphorone , and how ! - What happened ? - I think my electroantennogram just tilted . - What 's 0-13 calliphorone ? - Insect pheromone . - Where did you find this mother lode ? - A boy named Dylan Lokensgard . That specimen came from him . A boy secreting bug pheromones ? That 's impossible . Preposterous ! You 're the expert , Dr Bronzino . How else do you explain it ? Rocky ? A boy is a boy , a bug is a bug . You can 't have it both ways . OK , this boy is going through puberty . Maybe his body chemistry is going crazy and his raging teenage hormones are attracting all these insects . What if it 's more than chemistry or hormones , more than biology ? Dylan 's not just attracting these bugs . He 's using them to act out . Yes , but against what ? - We saw him talking to a girl . - The one in the Dumb Ass video . Captain Dare 's girlfriend . Natalie . - Natalie ! - Dylan ? - What are you doing ? - I need to talk to you , Dylan . You have to be quiet . My mom 's gonna hear you . I 'm coming up . What ? No . Hi . - You 're gonna break your neck . - I needed to see you . I haven 't been here in so long . Since fourth grade . After school . It was a Wednesday in April . " A dream in a mist of grey . " That 's from a Syd Barrett song . - How do you know all these things ? - My dad told me . Syd Barrett , he was in the band Pink Floyd . He was this brilliant guy that nobody understood . Kinda like you . Me ? I never said I was sorry when your dad disappeared , Dylan . I never said a lot of things . But I wanna say ' em now . I know you 've always cared about me . We 've grown apart , but ... I haven 't forgotten you . And ... after we talked this morning at school , I realized ... how special you really are to me . I can 't believe this . After what happened to Bill ... I realized ... how important it is to have someone who does understand you . And ... I want us to do this . That ... that was amazing . Mn ! What ... what was that ? - What was what ? - Your to ... Your mouth , your tongue . There 's something wrong with you ! No , don 't say that . - I need to go . - Natalie , please don 't . Just stay . Let me talk to you . Natalie , listen to me . Natalie , please ! Hey , Bug Boy ! How about we go for a little buzz around the block ? So , Lokensgard ... how 'd you do it ? Huh ? How 'd you kill him ? - Bugs killed Captain Dare . - Yeah , bugs that do what you say . You wanna know how I did it ? I 'll show you . Maybe you should get your camera ready . - What are you talkin ' about ? - I just have to open my mouth . What the hell ... Oh , God ! Mrs Lokensgard ? Dylan ? I 'm getting a reading here . Trace levels inside the house . Well , I guess that 's probable cause . Dr Scully ? This is so exciting . I 've never had a partner before . I have . I like to think of it as a hymenopteran relationship . Two scientists using knowledge to reach higher than either of them could reach alone . And , if I may say so , Doctor , you complete me . - I got upstairs , you take down . - All right . Oh , God . Ow ! - David Winkle , is that you ? - Yeah . - Now that 's a dumb-ass . - It wasn 't a stunt . It was Dylan Lokensgard . He attacked us . - He attacked you ? - Yeah , the dude 's a freakin ' bug ! He chewed right out the back window . Ow ! You stay . I 'll see that Dylan didn 't head to that girl 's house . - Scully . - Where are you ? I 'm with Rocky at the Lokensgard house , but nobody 's here . I 'm afraid the kid 's on a tear . He 's caused an accident on Glenhaven Road . How 'd he do that ? You 'd better see for yourself . C-13 calliphorone . I get a stiff reading up here . Dylan 's bedroom 's up there . Unfortunately he 's not in it . - Where are you going ? - Kid 's on a rampage . Whoa ! You got my number , partner . - Natalie ? - Whoever you are , leave me alone . Natalie , I 'm Monica Reyes , with the FBI . I 'm here because I need your help . - It 's about Dylan Lokensgard . - Don 't say that name around me ! It 's important . You may be the key to stopping him . Dylan Lokensgard is a freak ! I thought he was the normal one . I think Dylan was normal , just like any other kid . What he 's going through is to do with what he 's becoming . - He kissed me ! - And it 's probably what he 's living for . It 's probably why he lost control and attacked David Winkle and his brother . - He attacked Winky ? - They 're gonna be OK . We just wanna make sure he doesn 't hurt anyone else , all right ? Come with me . - Why did you run from me ? - What is wrong with you ? I 'm different , Natalie . Isn 't that what you wanted ? - Somebody different from Bill and Winky . - You killed Bill . To keep you from being killed ! - And now you 're coming with me . - Stay where you are , Dylan . Don 't try and stop me ! That little talk you wanted to have with me , it 'll have to wait . - Where do you think you 're going ? - It 's where we 're going , me and Natalie . - I 'll be taking the car . - You won 't . Don 't cross me , Mom . I am not some kid everybody can kick around any more . You think I don 't know what you are ? It 's what I 've been trying to tell you . Dylan , to save you from what you are about to do . These are the things I couldn 't tell you , the things I couldn 't tell your father . You are not like the other kids . You never will be . Monica ! Monica ? Holy Mother ! Monica , hold on ! Can you hear me ? Monica , can you breathe ? Monica , talk to me ! - He 's got the girl ! - Where 'd they go ? - To Dylan 's house . - That 's where Scully is . She lost phone contact with the entomologist Bronzino . - Where are they ? - I ... Natalie ! Help me . Help me . Four bodies were found in the Lokensgard attic . including that of Michael Lokensgard , Dylan 's father , long reported missing . It now appears that he , like the others , fell victim to Dylan 's mother , who , in Dr Rocky Bronzino 's expert opinion , was neither human nor insect , but something in between , a biological anomaly whose difference from the rest of humanity could be hidden only for so long . However strong Dylan Lokensgard 's yearning to fit in , to win acceptance , to love and to be loved , he could not defeat the unseen forces which direct behaviour . In the struggle between our desire to determine who and what we will be , and the identity which biology defines for us , there can only be one outcome . But even in victory , there are forces biology cannot defeat . The stirrings of the soul , the mysteries of desire , the simple truth that the heart wants what the heart wants . I made this !

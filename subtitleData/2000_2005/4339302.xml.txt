 Futurama [ 5x15 ] - Bender Should Not Be Allowed On TV - CiWaN Oh , my . Here we go , y 'all ! Zoidberg , Zoidberg . Zoidberg . This is a story about all my friends . Goodbye . Goodbye . Previously on All My Circuits : I 'm sorry , Father . But somewhere along the way , I forgot how to be your son . Why , Antonio ? Because I have amnesia ! Calculon ! But I thought you were- - Egyptian ? Before I kill you , I must ask you one question : Who am I ? For I have Amnesia ! Let me get this straight . Does anyone here not have amnesia ? Not sure . I don 't know . This show is awesome ! When I grow up , I 'm gonna have so much amnesia . Me too ! I mean , I have it now . But I forgot . Well , mine 's louder ! Cram a ham in it , you twerps ! Sorry . I had it coming . Welcome , swingers ! Pull up a groove and get fabulous ! Nude rock bands , big piles of what I assume is talcum powder . It 's quite a birthday party , Calculon . Cool ! I 'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon ! Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'm gonna show up looking good just like Monique . Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV ? We 're 12 . So , yes . Hold up , Cubert . You 're a clone of the professor . Do clones even have birthdays ? Duh . Duh what ? Dad ? Do I have a birthday ? Hmm . You didn 't have a birth , so technically , no . Hmm . Oh , don 't feel bad . We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank . Or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back . That one ! Yes . It was 13 years ago next week . I used this very fork . Oh , well , isn 't that- - Hey . Next week 'll be my birthday too ! That 's true ! Lf only there were a way to have one party for both of you ... Here at the office , then write it off as a business expense . Wait ! I thought of a way ! The way I just said ! Yeah ! Way to go , Pops ! Something 's happening on television ! Oh , Monique . Why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne ? Father ! I 've discovered the shocking secret ... Mother has kept from you for 200 years ! No ! No ! Brace yourself , for when I speak these words ... You may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia ! For you see , the horrible secret is- - Whoever 's directing this is a master of suspense ! He 's busteds . Let 's get hims out of heres . We now join America ' s most popular show in progress : Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad ! This show 's been going downhill since season three . Look who 's here , everyone ! It 's Zoidberg , the lovable tramp ! Since when are you performing at children 's parties ? Performing ? What ? Please , if someone could spare me money to buy shoes ? This party pukes . Yeah ! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago . Well , that doesn 't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers . Who gave you that idea ? All right ! They must 've all come as a group ! Welcome , swingers ! Pull up a groove and get fabulous ! Huh ? Good day , fellows . Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup . Happy growth-Scraping day to all ! Fire them all . Guys . Guys . Something 's happening on television again ! Welcome to Entertainment and Earth Invasion Tonite . Across the galaxy my people are completing a mighty space fleet ... That will exterminate the human race ! But first , this news from Tinsel Town . Following Antonio Calculon Jr . ' s breakdown on the set ... The popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call ... For child robots to replace him . An open casting call for child robots ? Tinny Tim ! Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? What 's that , sir ? That I , Bender , am perfect for the role ! You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly , sir . Bravo ! Bender , your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far . There 's a lot of famous child acting units here . Look , there 's Macaulay Culkon ! He 's just not cute since he got puberty installed . There 's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed the convenience store . And there 's that robot child actor who grew up ... And became a convenience store . Lottery ticket , please . We 're ready for the first audition . " Emote-Atron Jr . " ? Hold on , precious . Let 's make you look nice for the lady . What 's this ? What did I tell you ? No more hanging wires ! In this scene , you 've just found out your real father ... Is Calculon 's fourth evil identical septuplet , Sleazy Martinez . Okay ? Take us there ! Now that I know the truth , Father , I must ride south And join the robo-Bandidos at Veracruz ! Boo ! Boo ! This kid sucks ! We want Bender ! Boo ! Well , I thought he was good , but the audience seems to have turned on him . But I don 't think- - Next ! At Veracruz . So if you 'll kindly hand me my poncho- - Boo ! Bring on Bender ! Boo ! Bender 's the greatest ! Sorry , kid . You 're flailing up there . Ninety actors and they all got booed . I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about . They say he 's the greatest . Well , there is a robot named Bender here , but he 's much too old for- - Send him in forthwith ! Boo ! Not as good as Bender ! Boo ! Mr. Bender ? Have you ever been on TV before ? Once , when I took those hostages . I saw that . You were good . Let 's hear you audition . " Bandidos " ? Oh , this is great . Because I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent . I will see . Adi√≥s , Padre . Come , Jesus , my faithful chihuahua . Tonight we eat guacamole by the EI Rio ! That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer ! I don 't care how popular you are , you will never work on my show ! Yay , Bender ! We demand Bender ! However , you 've got the job . Welcome aboard , son ! Father-O ! I 'd like you to meet our director , whose name I never learned . Yo . I read the script , and I think it would help my character 's motivation If he was on fire . Don 't worry about the script , baby . We rewrote your part to suit your acting abilities . So now my character has a British accent ? No , now your character 's in a coma . Get in bed and don 't move . And action ! Stupid dumb coma . I could 've been British . Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible , permanent ... Coma . Permanent ? That 's completely out of character for Antonio . I 'm getting up . Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that- - Hey , everyone ! Antonio here , but you can call me Bender ! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut ! Come on , baby ! Come on ! I 'm not familiar with the type of thing I 'm seeing . Bite my shiny metal ass ! Yeah ! Come on , baby , yeah . Come on , yeah ! Cut ! That 's the worst coma acting I 've ever seen . We 'll have to shoot it again . No . No , no , no . I don 't do two takes . But this guy was- - Amateurs like you do two takes . I do one take . Print it . I 'll be in my three-Story trailer . Bite my shiny metal ass ! Yeah ! Come on , baby , yeah ! Come on , yeah ! Now , that 's hospital dancing ! Pretty good , hey , Calcy ? Good ? I 've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies . I didn 't shoot this . We didn 't . That 's security camera footage from your dressing room . He stole the scene and my money ? That 's it ! I demand you fire this felonious ham ! The network execu-Bots are coming ! Oh , dear God ! Presenting the president of the network ! Greetings , gentlemen . You already know my execu-Bots . Executive Alpha , programmed to like things it has seen before . Hey , hey , hey . Executive Beta . Programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule . More reality shows ! And Executive Gamma , programmed to underestimate Middle America . It 's funny , but is it going to get them off their tractors ? Now , who put this obnoxious dancing robot on my network ? We were about to fire him , sir . Silence , hack ! We 've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully . And during the 12 seconds Bender was on-Screen , viewer eyeball focus ... Was up 90 percent ! But , sir , children watch this show . Bender 's no role model . He 's a filthmonger . At our network , we love filth . Filthy rich , that is . Being filthy rich , that is . " Bite my shiny metal ass " could be a catchphrase . Eighty percent likely . It will play in Peoria . Game shows are back ! We need this edgy , sweeps-Ready robot on our network ! Bender , can you continue to drink , smoke and steal things on TV ? Yes , I can . Yeah , shooting ! All right ! Yo . Check out what I jacked from my dad . A cigar ? ! Ripping ! Look . I 'm Bender ! Ras H. Tafari ! What 's going on here ? The ruffians smoked one of your cigars . That 's not a cigar ! And it 's not mine . Hey , Dad . Bite my shiny metal ass ! What ? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us ! Where did you learn such language ? From Bender , my good jerkwad . Bender ? That guy 's really starting to twist my dreads . Okay , okay ! Get ready for this part ! Quiet , robot . Bender 's on TV . Oh , Calculon . It 's so good to get away from the city ... And that beastly yet intriguing Bender . And try this , kids at home ! Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth ' s children ? That 's crazy . A new protest group , Fathers Against Rude Television , says " Hell , yes ! " What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group ? Good news , everyone ! Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group ! That was uncanny . Fathers Against Rude Television don 't want our kids watching Bender 's ... High-Definition filth ! And for what ? Some kind of cheap laugh ? That 's not what F.A.R.T. is all about . No , sir ! Not us F.A.R.T.Ers ! You can 't censor me just because I 'm an obscenely bad role model . As unclean as it makes me feel , I agree with Bender . Kids don 't turn rotten just from watching TV . Yeah . Give a little credit to our public schools . Our dads are all pumped up on dork-Osterone . We 're just trying to be cool , like Bender . Yeah . And it 's not even working . Smoking and drinking make us barf . Gentle jerkwads I know how to emulate Bender without barfing . We could commit a burglary . Hey , yeah ! Bender loves to burgle ! Hold up , though . Who could we rob ? We don 't know anyone with cool stuff . Duh . We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel : Bender ! Whoa ! We 'll rob Bender ! TV gave us the idea ! You 're watching Futurama The show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery . Okay . It 's crime time . Hey , Bender . Hey , Bender . Hey , Bender . Hey , Bender . Oh ! What 's going on in here ? Oh . Now I 'm really outraged ! Where did you requisition this party ? And Zoidberg , what are you doing here ? I 'm networking . Let me give you my card . Relax , Dad . We just invited a few friends over . There 's something wrong with your story , but I can 't put my finger on it . Of course ! You don 't have friends ! Yeah ! Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden ? We 're just cool , is all . Balderdash ! I 'll be the judge of who 's cool , using the Cool-O-Meter ! Oh , yeah ! Good Lord ! I 'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies . Everybody out ! Aw So do you guys know about anything else going on ? Because I 'm totally still ready to party . There 's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happening pad . Where did it all come from ? Don 't tell , comrades ! All for one and one for all ! We stole it ! Oh , crumb . What ? What 's going on ? I 'll tell you what ! Our boys have taken up stealing . One of the worst and coolest of crimes . And all from watching you on TV , you cool jerk ! Hey , lay off me ! TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model . Bender is about entertainment , baby ! You can 't hold me responsible ... For what kids do when- - Hey . This is my stuff they stole ! That 's the last straw ! Bender should not be allowed on television ! Bender must be stopped ! I 've gone too far ! Who does that guy think I am ? Yeah ! That 's right ! Come on ! We 're gonna march all the way to Hollywood ... And make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats ! Yeah ! Down with Bender ! Down with Bender ! Down with Bender ! Down with Bender ! This mob 's with me . Go ahead . Down with Bender ! Down with Bender ! Down with Bender ! Down with- - Bender ! Down with Bender ! As a doctor and captain of this hospital ship ... I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live . Listen up , Hollywood ! We 're an exciting new mob ! Yeah ! You better believe it . Great Shatner 's ghost ! We demand that all TVs be equipped with a B-Chip ... That blocks Bender from appearing on the screen ! Boo-Ya ! Yeah . I 'm afraid the answer is a gritty , in-Your-Face no . Then I quit ! Then you don 't quit . I think you 'll be finishing the scene now , Mr. Bender . And don 't skimp on the nasty . There 'll be no further nasty ! We still have the option of resorting to violence ! What makes you think that 'll work ? I saw it on TV ... In that episode where Bender shot Calculon . How cool was that ? Yeah ! Come on ! Quit the show ! Do the scene . I 'm a cold-Blooded punk ! I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it . Hey , look ! The prop guy has a lamp ! Really ? Aha ! I was using that ! Listen up , because I 've got a climactic speech . You , cameraman , keep the camera rolling ! You , director ! Give me my motivation ! You 're angry . Perfect ! Viewers of the world , do smoking and drinking on TV ... Really make me cool ? Of course they do ! How about committing crimes and violence ? Again , the answer is yes . But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV ? I say absolutely not ! Oh ! On the other hand , most , perhaps all , the blame rests with the parents . That 's right , you ! And so I ask you this one question : Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV ... Sitting down with your children ... And hitting them ? We 're just so busy . Well , make time . And cut ! Good enough . Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air . Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV ... Sitting down with your children ... And hitting them ? Well , I 'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there . What was it ? That we should all take TV a little less seriously . And more importantly , turn it off once in a while . Hear , hear ! Darn right ! So should we turn it off now ? Well That depends what 's on . One now ... Nothing good . Let 's just keep watching .

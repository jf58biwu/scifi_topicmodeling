Temperature regulated . 20th century-inspired architecture . The attention to detail is astounding . Are we still underground ? Yep . A few kinks to work out , but still it 's a pretty impressive ASE level . ASE ? It 's the name for a level with an Artificial Surface Environment . We 've only charted a handful . But this is the only one known to simulate winter . Trust me , it 's a pretty mild winter . This way . Oh , it 's so beautiful . Take cover . What are we doing ? Shh . Daddy , I didn 't know there were monsters . So now you know . For every scary monster that tries to spoil your dreams there 's that one guardian angel who 's always wide awake . Who sees that monster even before you do . And what does that angel do when he sees that cowardly monster ? He calls you . Mmm-hmm . And that 's when I come to take care of you . Nole ? Nole , honey , there you are . What 's the matter ? There 's something goin ' on outside . Come on . I think he 's dead . What 's everybody looking at , Daddy ? Something you don 't have to see , sweetie . Let 's go home now . Voice , we found one . What 's his condition ? Dead . We need to identify him , Hel . Hey , Cleo . Hmm ? Okay , people . Come on , step back , all right ? There 's nothin ' to see here . We 'll take it from here , okay ? You can just go on home . Go home . Yes ? Who are you ? I 'm US Marshal Sam Gerard . These are my deputies . We 're with the UIA . UIA ? The Underground Intelligence Bureau ... Association . You 're not from here . Oh , no . We 're part of a new experimental group designed to serve and protect the underworld from outside forces . We fear this is one of our men . What have you got , Sarge ? It 's not good . Please leave . You 've compromised our level enough as it is . Wait . I 've always thought we were fools to think we could stay hidden . We 'd be even bigger fools to think we could protect ourselves against whoever or whatever did this . How can we assist you ? Okay . First , we need to get these people back , all right ? I need this whole area secured , I need you to dust for prints get some photos . And please , start workin ' these people because maybe , just maybe , somebody saw something , okay ? Get goin ' . You heard her . Come on . Let 's let them do their jobs . No sign of the Voice receptor . So the team leader may still be alive . Any sign what killed him ? We 've got precision hits to the chest and back , close range . Wait . Each ... Each one of these hits has a twin . That 's consistent with forearm weapons . Betrayer . Hel , finding the team leader is still the priority . Right . We 'll split . Sweep the village for survivors . Well , what about the Betrayer ? For all we know , this level could be infested with them . Yeah , well , let 's go waste ' em . No . This started as a rescue mission , and it 's gonna stay that way . Cleo , you 're with me . Okay , I 'll be back for a full report . This ASE place is way too convincing . You can 't tell me these aren 't real . See for yourself . Holograms . All of them . Come on . I don 't believe this . Now step to the side . That 's it . Come on , kids . Wow , you guys have this dance , too ? Awesome . How did I not know the one thing to survive the obliteration of mankind would be the Macarena ? Keep goin . Keep goin ' . All right . " Com-Yoppa " " Com-Yoppa " Hello ? It 's called the Com-Yoppa . Com-Yoppa ? Yeah . And I didn 't get it either the first time , till my dad taught me how . Then let 's Com-Yoppa . Hi . What 's your name ? Alexa . Oh , well , I 'm Cleopatra , and that 's Helen . Hi . Wow , I like your shoes . Thanks . My daddy brought them back from his long trip . They were definitely worth the wait . Helen , did you see these ? So , what 's the secret ? Gonna show me the steps ? I thought maybe you were the one who was going to show us . Oh , no , no , no , no , I 'm not the expert . Actually , your expert 's right here . Helen ? This isn 't part of the mission . Fine . You 've got that set for Betrayer . But I 'm not a Betrayer . I guess you 're not , either . Hel , I found the team leader . Good . We 're on our way . I figure the Betrayer made us when it saw Jace adjusting my Voice receptor . It 's completely fried now . We 've fixed most of the easy stuff , but he still has some serious internal injuries . Get him to a healing tube , right ? Four years . That 's how long my team was together . That Betrayer changed all that in about four seconds . Look , uh ... Xev . Right . Uh , Voice instructed us to - To give me a full recharge . No . To get you off of this level as soon as possible . Now we 'll get your report once Mauser gives you a clean bill of health . I 'm not leaving . I 've got a Betrayer to attend to . But thanks for patching me up . Wait . You mean , you know where the Betrayer is ? It was too dark to tell for sure . But I 've narrowed it down to three choices . Where did all this happen ? In their backyard . Three 's a bit messy , but at least we cover ourselves . Are you out of your mind ? You figure we follow them home ? Do it there ? It 's Alexa 's father . Remember her dancing shoes ? Daddy brought them home from his long trip . Well , Daddy 's going away for good this time . Voice , we 've ID 'd the Betrayer . Tell the Voice , with our combined firepower , we can get rid of that thing right now . Get Xev to safety , Hel . We 're taking you out of here . What ? I 'm not goin ' anywhere . You have serious injuries . This isn 't open for debate . But you 're open for running away ? I 'm open for taking this Betrayer out right now . And taking away Alexa 's father in the process ? She has a point . I don 't believe this . Look , he may be a ruthless killing machine around you , but look at him . Look at them . He 's still the daddy that that little girl has always known . The Bailies have made them near perfect . All the emotions , all the feelings from the original human specimens remain intact . Hel , Alexa 's real father , who he was , what he was chances are he 's already - He 's already dead . Do you understand that ? Yes , I understand that . But our directive remains the same which doesn 't include calling any more attention to ourselves than is necessary . We 're leaving . Xev ! Hey ! Where 's he going ? Son of a ... Hel , you need backup . When can we dance again , Daddy ? Any time , sweetie . Any time . Nole . Remember me ? Who are you ? This is a friend , Alexa . Look , why don 't you go back to the park with Mommy , okay ? Nole , what 's - Dana , please . Everything 's all right . Just take Alexa back to the park . I won 't be long . I promise . What 's wrong , Betrayer ? The Bailies accidentally drop a little fear inside you ? The Voice and those who follow it are the true Betrayers . Please , don 't . Don 't . I am still Nole . I still feel his love , my love , for my family . Help me . Help me remove the instinct . The instinct to destroy me ? Please . Tell me it 's possible . It 's not . You could leave me . Yes , just walk away . Yes , you see ? There 's always other options . Here 's an option for you . You okay ? Yeah . Alexa , are you okay ? Hmm ? Alexa , honey , why don 't you try and dance ? I don 't want to . Dana , I-I just wanted to check in and-and - Please , Helen , you don 't have to try and explain it all over again . You did what you had to do . You opened our eyes down here . But that won 't bring Nole back . We 'll be fine , Helen . Just not tomorrow . Dana ? I know what it 's like to lose a father . And what she needs now is for you to just love her and for you both to remember her father for the wonderful man that he was . What do you say , honey ? You want to go home ? Okay . Come on .

What do you want to do ? Seventeen years ago , I got trapped in a fire . I was in a coma for two days . My Dad saved me . Afterwards , when NASA called , he refused to leave . And you want to recreate that . I want to get as close as I can . I 'll get ... my old girlfriend to bring my ... self here . We 'll make sure my Dad saves me , light a fire . I can help .

Will they follow you down here ? No . Lieuten ... hah ... I mean Captain ... Well done . It 's good to see you , Sir . Good Morning , Florida ! I hope you 're having a very scary Halloween . Chief ! We 've been looking for you all night . I saw you with them . I don 't know what you saw , Dot , but I think I need a warrant . The charges are almost ready . They 'll create more smoke than fire . Your father 'll have a quarter of an arn to get you out . I 'll set a perimeter . Make sure we 're not interrupted . And I 've made enough syrup ... to keep the kid unconscious for three arns . Oh , oh don 't worry , I 've tested it on the enforcer , so the boy won 't wake in the middle of the rescue . We 'll see . I 'll go get my ... self , and I 'll be right back . Mmm . You smell nice . Thank you . Well , what do the cards say ? You 're definitely staying . They look happy . I didn 't see my parents like that very often .

He 's just ... you know , a girl like you ... . Are you flirting with me ? Huh ? No . Why would I do that ? - No , I 'm just ... - Hey ! What the hell did you do that ? We 're in a hurry . So ... this is what ... what you 're in to . She 's a nice girl ! Well , if she 's really that nice , how about you take care of her and , uh , I 'll take care of him . No questions asked . - Trick or treat ! Trick or treat ! Trick or treat ! - Come in . Over here . Trick or treat , money or eats . Cool toy ! I did it ! I got it ! I got it ! What the hell ? Rygel ! Stop doing that ! But I love this and you ... you ... you won 't buy me any more . I want a Kit-Kat and MM 's and Pez and Reeses Pieces . - All for me ! - D ? You all set ? Yah . I 'm just priming the last charge . Noranti ? How much longer til ... til the serum 's ready ? Half an arn . Can you keep him occupied ? I 'll think of somethin . I 'm sure you can . Hmm . Okay . Garage ! - Yah . - Yah ! Is this , uh ... your ... f ... first ? Is this how you ... you imagined ... it ? Not in Betty . I always thought it 'd be in my Dad 's four-wheel drive . - Does Grayza know you 're my spy ? - No . But she 'll figure it out when she discovers you 're alive . She must never find that out . We 've got to stop her . She 's organizing a peace initiative with the Scarrans . They 're using her . They 'll agree to everything , then betray us , when their forces are battle ready . What shall I do ? Stall her , Braca . I 'm not given to exaggeration , but ... the future of Peacekeeper survival depends on you . I got the warrant . Let 's go search that house . Everything is set . You can do this ? No problem . Just make sure everyone stays out of sight ... until he drinks it . Hey . Hey . Here . It 's okay ? We 've got trouble . Two enforcers . - Stay down ! - Hang on ! You 're that guy that ... Chiana ! Keep him down ! Crichton ? - Crichton ! - What 's the matter ? Old Woman ! I thought she tested this stuff . Is this supposed to be happening ? No pulse . Ive got no pulse ! Police . Open up ! Crichton . - Crichton , I don 't know what ... - What ! ? Your arm ! Police . Open the door . We have a warrant to search these permises . Open up the door ! Open the door ! It 's the police ! - Where 's Crichton ? - I 'm here . I 've disappeared . Calm down . Everything 's under control . Under control ? Oh ! I 'm gone ! What happens next ? I lose my voice ? - I wish . Keep your voice down . - Police ! Open up ! Keep it down . The sheriff 's body weight must be greater so ... I gave the boy too much . - Bring me back ! - Just bring him back . His body ... has stopped functioning and you are ceasing ... wherever you are ... to exist . We 're going to have to let them in . Are you ready ? Yah . - Two of them . You take the big one . - Yah . - Hello . - Ma 'am . - Hi . Grandma ... Fix me . You 're just a nookie ! Haven 't you ever died before ? Move ! What are you doing ? Hey ! Is that is ? See . Nothing to worry about . Then , why am I like this ? Well ... I couldn 't bring him back too quickly so I don 't really know , but I ... think your semi-corporeality won 't last long . So why don 't you use your condition to our advantage ? Fine . I 'll go get my Dad . I 'm Casper the frickin joke . Who are you people ? Aliens . - I 'm gonna to set the charges for the smoke . - Right . Let 's get ' em into the garage . Mom . It 's me . Johnny ? I love you . I 've wanted to tell you that for a very long time . What 's the matter ? I 'm in trouble . I 'm in the Carson house . Get Dad and tell him to save me . Jack ! - Jack ! - Mom , listen ! When you first feel the pain , don 't don 't wait . The initial scans were accurate . The Leviathan is empty . I assumed as much . I accessed the memory banks . The pilot has no idea where Crichton 's gone . Braca ... prepare the marauders . Set course for our meeting with the Scarrans . Yes Ma 'am . You two , come with me . There 's no way that Moya can detect your presence . But Crichton 's DNA , which I provided for you , will enable you to detect his presence . So when he returns , as we know he will , capture him alive . Remember nothing ... Hurry . Except for Karen Shaw ... in the four-wheel drive . Remember nothing ... Okay , we 've gotta go ! Hey Wrinkles ! No , no , no , no . - It 's time to go . - No ! - No , no , no . The sheriff ... must ... forget . - No . They 're coming . He must ! - Is everyone else back on the ship ? - Yes . Jack 's on his way . John ? John ! John ? Johnny ? Damn , he moves fast for an old guy ! You 're back . Yah . In more ways than one . - Hello ? - Damn . She 's going to screw things up . My dad has to do it by himself . Aeryn . John ? Where are you ? John , are you here ? John ? You know , if he stays in there too much longer , it 's gonna catch on fire . Why do our plans never work ? Murphy 's Law . Son ... D ! I 'm gonna get myself . You take Dad . You all right ? I 'm still here . Try not to frown so much . Good luck . - We 've gotta go . I 'll start LoLah . - Yah . All right . John ! Come on , pal . Breathe ! Breathe . You 'll be okay . - Jack ? Oh my ... - Talk to me . Come on . What 's goin on ? He 's alright . He 's okay . I think it 's time to go . Johnny ? Johnny , you okay ? I got no idea why nobody else remembers . I swear to God I 'm tellin the truth . There was ... um ... this guy and he was invisible . And , um ... this other thing that had this long tongue . Uh , he knocked me out with it . And they left this . ... as a sign . This has gotta be like a message or somethin . 'Cause nobody human could 'a made it . There 's no way a human could 'a made this . How is everything else on your planet ? We did okay . Is there any way we can save those people going aboard that doomed shuttle ? No . Time must play out . Crichton ? Can you hear me ? Yes , Pilot . Where are you ? Where you said to be . Well , we 're scanning now , and you 're not here . - Yes , we are . - No . You 're not . Pilot , listen up , this is important . What year is it where you are ? Transmission from your earth indicates it 's ... two thousand and three . Follow my signal . Commander ... come home . Okay . I 'm locking on now . Here it comes . By Lannit ... another earth . No . Same earth , Sparky . Just a different year . Welcome home , son . We 've been waitin for ya a long time . What 's wrong , John ? Was it a bass ... or a trout ? Subtitles : PK SUB-66

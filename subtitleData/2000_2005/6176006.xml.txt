 Let me get this straight . You buy personal items for a small amount of money ... you sell them to perfect strangers for a lot more money ? Is America a great country or what ? Yo , Toni . I got a nice surprise for you today . - You got a job ? Who needs one when you can find rich stuff like this ? A digital camcorder . It 's got liquid crystal display ... digital something , headphone jack . Nice ! Looks like it fell in the river . - It did . I found it in the washbasin below Koomer Falls . I figure some mope must have been makin ' a home movie and dropped it . Give you 20 bucks for it . - Twenty ? I was looking for more like a hundred . Yeah , and people in hell are lookin ' for ice water . One Andrew J. Take it or leave it . You drive a hard bargain . What 's a home movie ? Did you grow up in a basement or something ? Or something . - You know , mom , dad and the kids ... go off on the great American family vacation ... and record it for posterity ... in case anybody wants to watch it without a gun to their head . I would . I 'd love to . How much ? - Hundred bucks . Sold . Like I said , is America a great country or what ? It 's Tuesday the 9th , day four of our vacation ... and today we 're officially starting our trip down memory lane . Here on the banks of " Kooner " ... What is this ? A stream or ... - It 's a creek . Koomer Creek . Koomer Creek . Yeah . Well , whatever it 's called ... it 's beautiful . - What ? I thought this was gonna be stupid , but it 's neat . Really ? You mean Mom 's not a complete moron ? Well , not complete . - Ha , ha , ha . So this all used to be part of Gramps 's land ? Yeah . This is where I grew up . Right over there on that log is where your dad first kissed me . Oh , my God . Look . It 's still there . What ? - Look . Here . Let 's get a shot . " Nancy and Ted . " Dad told me there was a place near here ... like , a cabin or something , you guys used to go to , to be alone . Hmm . It 's an old mill . Yeah ? - Mm-hmm . Is that where I came from ? - What do you mean " came from " ? Well , you said this trip was something about my heritage . I was just wondering if you and Dad gave-Yeah . a whole new meaning to " grinding the corn . " Let me tell you something , young lady . - Hitting too close to home . Um , you know what ? I forgot my fanny pack in the car . I 'll be right back . Okay . You know , this place actually doesn 't suck . Can 't believe you didn 't bring me here before now . Mom , are you listening to me ? I 'm being serious for once , and she 's not listening to me . Stop it ! No ! Mom , you okay ? - Leave me alone ! Mom ? - Help ! Mom , are you okay ? If you 're joking around , this isn 't funny . This isn 't funny . Where are you ? Mom . Mom . Mom ! Are you okay ? What happened ? - Run . Run . What ? - Run . He 's - He 's coming back . Hey . - Run . Help ! Somebody help me , please ! Shut up . - Help ! Help , please ! Help me ! Somebody help us , please ! Help me . Somebody help us , please ! Somebody help us ! Help ! There are Pretenders among us . I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and abused . - Life 's a gift . You a doctor ? - I am today . Leigh , honey , move over close to the sign . Oh , I sure hope this is gonna work . So , it 's Monday the 8th , day three of our vacation ... and we are here at ... Slade . Oh , guess what , Dad . She 's gonna let me drive for a while . Your car . Yeah , now , that 's pretty . Boy , Dad 's gonna love that . Do you have to record this ? Don 't you have something to say ? Um , I had a little accident in your Mustang . And we need a new taillight . But Mom 's gonna check and see if they have one here . And I promise I 'll pay for it all . Yeah , right . Okay , here . Now , I 'm gonna get some gas . And then I 'll check and see if they have a new light . " J. R. ' s Service Station . " I feel like we 're in Mayberry . Only it looks like Goober 's had a lobotomy . Hey . But Barney 's got a cute butt . Leigh , behave yourself . Like you didn 't notice . - What ? I didn 't notice . Yeah , right . Any news from Jarod ? In a manner of speaking . He 's up to his old tricks , but this time with a new twist . One that 's right up your alley , Broots . Sit . My alley . Ooh . - Turn it on . You have mail . Well , hello , Miss Parker . I 've put together a little postcard for your viewing pleasure . Just click and enjoy . Hey . This is cool . When Debbie and I go to Rock City , I can send you one of these . Now , you 've already met Edna ... who despite being locked in an asylum for decades by her loving husband , Mr. Raines ... is an amazing historian of the Centre . Edna knows things about your mother , Miss Parker . Things she won 't tell to anyone but you . She wouldn 't even tell me . Edna wants to come home , but she can 't . There 's an army of Sweepers out there looking for her . She told me her redemption ... will be to tell you what she knows before they catch her . So you better hurry . Be careful . And know that Edna said no matter what happens , she wants you to keep digging . That the secret your mother wanted to tell you when you were little ... is buried out there , and you need to find it . It 's like an electronic trail of bread crumbs . That we better get busy following before someone gobbles everything up . Damn it . Havin ' a little trouble ? - You could say that . I don 't know what happened to it . I don 't believe I 've seen you around here before . I 'm just passing through . Or I was passing through . Looks like I 'm gonna be staying here for a while . Well , J. R. ' s just up the road up there . Hop in . I 'll give you a push . See if we can get you on your way . Looks like I 'm gonna have to order the parts from Flagstaff ... seeing as we don 't stock parts for vintage cars like that . Be tomorrow before you 're up and runnin ' again . I can 't imagine what might be wrong with it . Corn Man a-comin ' . The Corn Man ? - Well , you 're a stranger . There 's a curse on strangers come to Slade . Curse of the Corn Man . That 's why you 're having trouble with the car . Newt , shut up about that old wives ' tale . - Ain 't no wives ' tale . Started when that stranger showed up at old man Koomer 's place ... back in the olden days . Stranger chopped up the family . The whole family . Tiny little pieces . They found them all down at the corn mill . The Corn Man 's soul ain 't never rested . You can see it lightin' up the sky at night . His ghost still haunts strangers that come into this town . I said shut up , Newt . - You can tell me to shut up all you want . Corn Man 's still a-comin ' . Not that I 'm puttin ' any stock in Newt 's curse ... but does seem like you 've been havin ' a streak of bad luck lately . I had a couple of women bash right into me . They said they were passing through here . Mother and daughter . Driving a red Mustang convertible . - Oh , they was pretty . The blondes . Looked like they could be sisters . They needed a taillight , as I remember , but I didn 't have one for a ' 65 . They just got some gas and headed out . I haven 't seen them since . Fill her up , little brother . And be sure and put it on the department 's account . You ever get tired of telling me what to do , big brother ? Brotherly love , you understand ? You must be the guy the sheriff radioed in about . Word sure travels fast around here . Yeah . Well , you know , we like to stay on top of things . Anything I can help you with ? - Actually , maybe you could recommend a motel . Looks like I 'm going to be here for a while . Well , Clearwater Inn 's the only one in town . Don 't get much business , except for an occasional trucker , but , uh , it 's clean . I can give you a lift . - Ah , no , thanks . Actually , I 'd rather walk . Get to see your town . Don 't blink . You 'll miss it . Corn Man a-comin ' . The Clearwater Inn . I 've always wanted to stay at a zero-star resort . Leigh , try and be nice for five minutes . I am being nice . Welcome to Clearwater Inn . - Thank you . Room 's all ready . Room 14 . Room 14 it is . - Presidential suite . What president stayed here ? Millard Fillmore ? Well , actually , I just call it that ... so I can charge more to smart-mouthed kids and their mothers . Clever . I 'm sure it 'll be just fine . Thank you , Raymond . Come on . Let 's go . Hello . I 'd like to rent a room , please . Fill this out . Be sure and put down the make and model of your car . Actually , I 'm going to need a rental . - Uh , two blocks that way . And good luck with what you get . - Well , it doesn 't matter . Just want to drive around . It 's beautiful here . Well , that 's in the eyes of the beholder . Some friends of mine seemed to have thought so . As a matter of fact , I think they stayed here a couple of days ago . A mother and daughter . Beautiful , blonde . Mmm . Don 't remember ' em . I hear you only get the occasional trucker through here . Surely you remember two beautiful women in a red convertible . Hmm . Well , you 'd think I would . But I don 't , because they weren 't here . Here we go . Think we 'll put you in room number five . I 'll take number 14 , please . It 's my favorite number . Sure . Fourteen it is then . Yeah , there 's someone here asking about ' em . Even knew what room they were in . Mom . Do you believe in ghosts ? Ghosts ? - Yeah . You know , the souls of the dead . They can come back to haunt the living . I don 't know , honey . I never really gave it that much thought . Then how do you explain those flashes ? It 's called heat lightning . And it 's been happening around here for a long time . - Whatever it is , it 's freaky . Like that story that guy was telling me back at the gas station . You know , the one that gave me this . He was telling me about the curse . All strangers are cursed . - Hmm . It all started back when some Corn Man hacked up a family out by Grandpa 's old ranch . Honey , that 's just an old tale that people have been telling for years . It 's ridiculous . I hope so . - It is . Okay . Wait . How do you turn this off again ? - Little red button . Mom . - What ? Mom , there 's somebody out there . - What ? Where ? By the tree . He was standing - He 's staring at me . Okay . Look . I don 't see anyone . He was right there by the tree . I swear . If there was someone there , they 're not there now . He warned us we 'd be in danger . Maybe he was right . Maybe the Corn Man 's coming , Mom . That 's not happening . Go to bed . How do I turn this off again ? Jarod , a 15-year-old girl ... is found brutally murdered in her bedroom . Part of an upper-class community in a small town . We don 't know what happened between the time she left her friends ... and when she was murdered . - What is it you want me to do , Sydney ? Take the evidence . Use your skills as a Pretender . Become the victim . Do what she did . Feel what she felt . It 's Tuesday the 9th , day four of our vacation ... and today we 're officially starting our trip down memory lane . Here on the banks of " Kooner " ... What is this ? A stream or ... It 's a creek . Koomer Creek . - Koomer Creek . Yeah . Well , whatever it 's called , it 's beautiful . This is where I grew up . You know , this place actually doesn 't suck . Can 't believe you didn 't bring me here before now . - Stop it ! No ! - Mom ? Leave me alone ! - You okay ? Mom ? Help ! - Mom , are you okay ? Mom , if you 're kidding around , this isn 't funny . Where are you ? Mom ! Mom . Mom . Mom . Are you okay ? What happened ? Run . He 's coming back . Run . I can 't see it , Sydney . I can 't figure it out . You have to figure it out . The family is counting on you . Somebody help us , please ! Corn Man a-comin ' . Well , mister , you 're good to go . Funny thing , parts shop said ... they never heard of this happening with this model before . Well , that is funny . Not if you 're a stranger it ain 't . It 's the curse . That 's why I went and made you this here corn man to keep you safe . If you 're gonna stay around here , you 're gonna need it . Thanks . I think . Well , I see Kent 's got you all fixed up there ... Mr , uh ... You know , I 'm not sure I got your name . I 'm not sure I gave you my name . Guess you 'll be on your way then . Who knows ? Maybe I 'll stick around . I 'm growing kind of attached to the place . You don 't got a job or a home to go back to ? I 'm sort of in between both right now . Well , I 'd advise you get one or the other . Idle hands are the devil 's play things . I don 't plan to be idle . I 'm not too fond of strangers . I hope the Corn Man don 't get him . Any luck finding Edna ? I 've enhanced this photo from Jarod 's e-mail . There 's no one we recognize in the crowd ... but from the signage and license plates , it looks like a street scene in New York City . Somewhere in Harlem . - Hmm . Edna wants to come home , but she can 't . There 's an army of Sweepers out there looking for her . She told me her redemption ... will be to tell you what she knows before they catch her . So you better hurry . - Hmm . Home . Redemption . Of course . One of my mother 's favorite charities ... was a halfway house in Harlem called Redemption Home . Jarod 's telling you that 's where you can find Edna . Mr. Wright ? - Mm-hm m . I have to talk to you about your wife and your daughter . There 's been some trouble . - Trouble ? What do you mean ? I-I just spoke with them . When ? - This morning . They said they were fine . What 's the problem ? We 've had a minor car accident . Well , that 's strange . Nancy didn 't mention anything about it . That is strange . That car must mean a lot to you . Actually , it was your daughter who was driving . Leigh . She backed into me . Uh , your wife gave me the name and number of your insurance company ... but I seem to have misplaced it . Is your wife expected home soon ? No . They 're both still out of town . Look . All my insurance is handled through Western Mutual . But , you know , I prefer to handle this myself . So why don 't you get an estimate , and I 'll send you a check for the full amount . Yes , but I would not ... I 'll be in touch . Somebody was here . He was asking about them . Tall guy . Dark hair . Edna Raines is in this building . Here in room 24 . But the guy said that I was the second person to look for her in the last half hour . Raines . - What the hell are you doing here ? What the hell are you doing here ? She was my wife . Was ? - Edna Raines is dead . An overdose . How convenient . I can only assume she couldn 't face the world any longer . With you in it , who could blame her ? I 'll miss her so much . Is that why you kept her locked up for 30 years ? That was to protect her . You never protected anyone but yourself , Raines . You can bury her again , Raines . Along with all the secrets she died for . Sheriff . - Yeah . We need to talk . Uh , just a second there , sir . Yeah . Sheriff 's office . What ? No . Your brother 's not here . Yeah . He is the deputy , Kent . He 's on patrol . Yeah . I 'll tell him to call you when he gets back . All right . Okay . Sorry about that . What 's the problem now ? I found something , and I want to show you . I was - Damn it . Sheriff 's office . Yeah . Uh , listen . I can 't talk right now . Um - I understand . I - I 'll get right back with you . Soon . All right ? Yeah . Just stay there . Wake up . I said wake up ! Start talkin ' . Talkin ' about what ? Everything you know about Nancy and Leigh . From the beginning . I know they disappeared four days ago . And I know that Mr. Wright here has taken out a rather large insurance policy on them . Hey . What the hell are you sayin ' ? I 'm sayin ' that you and the sheriff here ... have conspired to murder your wife and your daughter ... so you could collect insurance money . - Murder ? Pal , we 're trying to save them . - That why you tried to kill me ? Kill ya ? We found you . - You kidnapped my wife and daughter . You 're gonna tell us where they are . - Kidnapped ? I didn 't kidnap them . I 'm here to find them . Look . There 's a camcorder over there . There 's a tape in it . It will explain everything . Are you okay ? What happened ? - Run . Run . What ? - Run . He 's ... He 's coming back . Run . - Help ! Hey . - Help me , please ! Help . Help ! Somebody help us , please ! Oh , my God . Who the hell are you ? I was on vacation when this sort of fell into my lap . Jarod Wilson , U. S. Marshals . - A fed . Damn it , Frank . He finds out , he 's gonna kill them . - What are you talking about ? Four days ago I got a call . A man . He said if I wanted to see my wife and daughter again ... to get $ 500,000 by tonight ... and not to contact the authorities . Ted got a hold of me and made me promise I wouldn 't bring in any outside help . We 've been , uh , friends since high school and Raymond here . Then you started sniffing ' around , and we figured you were involved . Do you think it 's someone local ? Well , a lot of local people are aware of Ted 's financial success and his family . To tell you the truth , we don 't have much to go on . And even less time . I was Edna Raines 's therapist . I can assure you that she wouldn 't have taken her own life . At least not willingly . Edna knew she was in danger . That 's why Jarod was so cryptic about her location . Be careful . And know that Edna said no matter what happens , she wants you to keep digging . That the secret your mother wanted to tell you when you were little ... is buried out there , and you need to find it . Buried ? But where ? Who 's the most adept at burying things around here ? Mr. Raines . Got the cash . Everything 's ready to go . He should 've called by now to tell me where to drop the money . He 's going to call , Mr. Wright . Just be patient . I don 't want to be patient . I want my family back . Ted , he 's on our side . Keep him on the line as long as possible . Tell him you demand to speak to Nancy - that you won 't make a delivery until you know that your wife is safe . This is Wright . Put the money in a duffel bag . At midnight , you , and you alone - will take it and leave it in the trash bin at the bridge on Long Tunnel Road . I want to talk to my wife . - You 're not in a position to make demands . I am not paying $ 500,000 for two dead bodies . Ted ? - Nancy . Oh , Ted , thank God . Are you and Leigh all right ? Yeah . We 're a little ground up , but we 're , um-we 're alive . Just hang in there , sweetie . Everything 's gonna be okay . Ted , I love you . I love you too . Both of you . Midnight . - I 'll be there . I got it . I made the delivery . All right . It 's been over an hour . I haven 't seen anything yet in my position . How about you , Raymond ? Yeah . Do you see anything ? How 's it goin ' ? Nothin ' so far . - Well , keep your head up . Jarod . - I don 't like this , Sheriff . He should 've shown up by now . - Jarod , I think I got something . Damn ! Raymond ! - Raymond , can you hear me ? What the hell happened ? I saw the guy coming straight at me . He was on a motorcycle . I thought I could stop him . Next thing I knew I was down . The bullet entered from behind . How can that be ? There are two kidnappers . Never again . You hear me ? Don 't even ask . Never again . Calm down and check your pants . Now tell me what you found . - Nothing . Well , almost nothing . Excuse me . I cross-referenced everything in Raines 's files with Edna 's name , and the only thing - the only thing I came up with ... was section " G , " 14 , dash , six ... in a communique intercepted by Raines from Edna to you . What ? Section " G. " Row 14 , plot six . That 's my mother 's grave . Jarod 's e-mail said to keep digging . The answers ... are buried out there . You don 't think Jarod wants you to dig her up ? Miss Parker , it 's your mother 's grave . Get shovels . We 've got work to do . They 're dead . If the kidnappers haven 't killed them already , they will now for sure . What are you doin ' ? I 'm gonna watch this video again . Maybe I missed something . Can 't believe you didn 't bring me here before now . Are you okay ? If you 're joking around , this isn 't funny ! Well , not complete . - Ha , ha , ha . I 've studied the evidence and read the interviews , but ... it just doesn 't make sense . The answer 's right in front of you . Everything you need is there . But I can 't see it . - But she can . See what it is that she sees . Look , Jarod . Look hard . Did you see that ? What ? That . The answer 's there . It was there the whole time . She sees him . Adams ? He was in the parking lot ? Adams ? Who 's Adams ? My deputy . - And one of the kidnappers . Then who 's the other one ? - My guess is his brother Kent ... from the gas station . So these guys have gone to kill my family ? - Not if we get to them first . Wait a minute . Listen to this . - Nancy . Oh , Ted , thank God . - Are you and Leigh all right ? We 're a little ground up , but we 're alive . We 're a little ground up ... We 're a little ground up ... I don 't understand . - " Ground up . " On the video , Leigh kept referring to an old mill . Yeah , near my father-in-law 's ranch . Nancy and I used to go there all the time . You wife was trying to tell you where she and your daughter were being held . Let 's go . Let 's just hope they 're still alive . You 've made me do a lot of things I don 't want to do , Miss Parker ... but this has gotta be the worst . What if someone finds us ? Then you 'll just have to hold them off while I go for help . Oh , great . That 's lovely . Row 14 's over here . Whoa . Sorry . I feel like I 'm in a Scooby-Doo cartoon . Wait . What was that ? - Settle down , Shaggy . It 's an owl . This is it . Miss Parker , this just isn 't right . Are you sure you want to do this ? Jarod 's done a lot of twisted things ... but he would never lead me here just to torment me . Now dig . Where the hell have you been ? - Wright tipped off the sheriff . We gotta get out of here . - No one followed me . That 's because I put a bullet in the leg of the guy who could 've . What about them ? This wasn 't part of our plan . Yeah , well , plans change , little brother . They can identify us . Leigh , now ! Run ! I 'll get the daughter . You take care of her . Damn , mom . That hurt . If that 's the way you 're gonna be ... Oh , I don 't think so . Nancy . - I 'm fine . But Leigh ... She ran out , and the deputy went after her . You can 't get away . Get away from me ! Don 't work that way . It 's nothing personal . You understand . - Please . I want to go home . Just business . - Please . I want to go home . The only place you 're going is in Koomer 's Creek ! - No ! Stop screaming ' . No one can hear you scream out here . I can . Come here ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ? It 's okay . It 's fine . It 's fine . It 's fine . Leigh . - Go . Go . Leigh . - Leigh . Baby . Oh . I don 't know how to thank you , Jarod . Just take care of them . I will . You ready to go ? Let 's go home . Well , this is it . Miss Parker , are you sure you want to do this ? Ah . - Huh ? Open it . - Miss Parker ... Why don 't we just get the hell out of here ... and let her rest in peace ? I want to rest in peace . Now open it . Are you sure ? Go ahead . Oh , my God . What ? - Miss Parker , your mother ... She 's not in here . Then where the hell is she ? Jarod , I 'm only going to ask you this once . How did you know she wouldn 't be there ? I didn 't . - Then who ? Edna did . She knew all the secrets . Especially about the Mirage Project . Unfortunately , she took them to her grave . Well , I am sorry for you . Edna was someone you could 've trusted . Unlike the Centre . Or my family . You were right in putting your trust in your mother . She knew the importance of family . Of helping people . If she kept any secrets from you , it was to protect you . Protect me from what ? The truth . Keep searching , Miss Parker . But remember . You can 't believe everything you see . After all , life is a mirage . Sometimes the things that scare you the most ... can be the things that save your life .

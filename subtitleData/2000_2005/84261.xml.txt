 If anyone finds this it means my plan didn 't work and I 'm already dead . But if I can somehow go back to the beginning of all of this I might be able to save her . Evan ! We 're going to be late again . When did you care about going to school on time ? We 're putting up pictures of parents today . Don 't worry , we 'll have plenty of time . Is Dad going to come ? You know the answer to that . Can 't he just come out for one day ? We 've been over this a hundred times . It 's too dangerous for him . But Lenny said his dad is coming .. and Tommy and Kayleigh 's Dad . Ok I get the point ! I 'm not so bad , am I ? No . Ok ! Have a great day . I love you . I 'll pick you up later . Got to go . Bye ! Bye ! Mrs. Treborn , I need to speak to you . Can it wait till tonight ? I 'm already late for work and I ... I think you really need to see this . Tommy ! Leave Lenny alone ! Don 't make me send you to Mr. Voyteck office ! I was going to show this to the principal but I thought I should talk to you first . What is it ? Yesterday , I had the children make drawings of what they wanted to be when they grew up . Most of them made drawings of what their parents did . But this .. I don 't understand . Evan did this ? Can I keep this drawing ? Of course . There is one more thing Mrs. Treborn I feel bad even mentioning . What ? When I asked Evan about the drawing .. well .. he couldn 't remember doing it . I don 't wanna go . I don 't like this place Mom , it 's creepy . I promise I won 't make any bad pictures . You 'll be fine . He just wants to do a couple of tests . That 's all . You 'll like him . You 're doing great . Just tell me he hasn 't inherited his father 's illness . I 'm sure the test results will come back negative . But there 's something else you can do to monitor his memory . Anything . A journal . Just have him write down everything that he does . And what will that do ? It could help jog his memory . See if he remembers anything new the next day . These test results will come back in a few days and we 'll take it from there . OK Today , mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy . I 'll meet their father and see what a real dad is like . Great ! See you soon . Evan ! Evan . What are you doing with that knife ? What happened ? Honey .. .. what were you doing with that knife ? I don 't remember . Hey Andrea . George ! Hello little man . Watch your steps . Thanks George . Not a problem . Here 's my number at the hospital in case there are any problems . Please keep an eye on him , ' cause ... You 're kidding ! We 're gonna have a great time today . Right sport ? OK ! Be good kiddo . I love you . Bye bye . Bye George . Go .. go on . Right in the back yard . Here it comes . Evan , Evan guess what ? Dad got a new video camera and we 're all gonna be in a movie . That 's right Evan and you get to be the star . I thought I was the star ! Hey ! What did I tell you ? Now Evan . You have to promise your bestest super-duper promise that this will be our little secret . Think you can do that ? My boy . Where am I ? Where did we all go ? Calm down kid . Stand still . I was just somewhere else . How did I get here ? Quit acting like some damn retard or I 'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you 've been . Kayleigh ? Kayleigh . What happened ? The good news is , the results are negative . I found no evidence of lesions , haemorrhaging , tumours .. But you must have something you can go on ? If I were to guess I 'd say the blackouts are stress related . But he 's seven years old . What kind of stress can a seven year old have ? Plenty . Maybe he has severe coping problem about not having a father . You said the last time the blackouts occurred he was visiting his friend 's dad . Well .. he has been pushing me to meet his father .. and I 've been putting it off . It 's worth a shot Andrea . We can arrange a controlled meeting . A careful dose of sedatives for Jason , some security , Evan comes in for a quick visit , and with a little luck , .. no more missing father complex . April 15th . Today I get to meet my father . His name is Jason and he 's crazy . I hope he lets me call him Dad . Dad lives here ? Not in this wing , actually . No . If your dad seems a little sleepy it 's because of the medicine , OK ? OK . It 'll just be a moment . It 's OK , I won 't bite . - You 've seen pictures of me , right ? - Uh huh . Mom says I have your smile .. and your hair . I 'll kill you ! He has to die ! It 's the only way ! Jason , stop ! No ! He 's just fainted . It 's gonna be alright . Come on man , he 's OK . Get a stretcher . - Let 's get him out of here . - I 'm so sorry Evan . ... we commend to almighty God , our brother Jason . The Lord bless him and keep him . The Lord make His face to shine upon him , and be gracious unto him and give him peace . Amen . Come on , where is it ? I know it 's down here somewhere . Tommy , I 'm bored shitless . It 's so boring . Yeah , what are you looking for anyway ? Shut up , lard ass . And you , hold your fucking horses . It 's here somewhere . We should go soon . If Dad catches us smoking down here , we 're dead . So , lets go . I knew Dad has a blockbuster down here . Let 's blow the shit out of something . Here you go buddy . What ? No friggin ' way man . I 'm not touching this thing . The hell you aren 't ! Any of us does , and you 're gonna puss out and knock for sure . Ain 't gonna work this time buddy . Look how small this fuse is . I 'll get killed . Not necessarily . Here you go . That should buy you two minutes , at least . Gee , thanks friend . Oh for Christ 's sake , Lenny , you moron ! Just do it . You have balls man . Sure took you long enough . What the hell ? Come on ! Evan , come on ! Help me get him up . Evan , get your ass back here and help me get him up ! What happened ? Where are we ? Oh my God . What did we do ? Evan , come on ! Help me ! Oh my God . How could we ? Come on , let 's go . Lenny , what happened to you ? He 's fine , he 's gonna be OK . Everything is going to be fine . What 's wrong with him ? Why isn 't he speaking ? He 's in shock ma 'am . What is it ? What happened ? We were just in the woods building a fort when Lenny freaked out . One minute he was OK and then he just froze up . Right guys ? What happened Evan ? The truth . I dunno , I .. I don 't remember . Something must have happened . Something set him off . I blanked it out . Don 't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one . You 're not making it up ? I don 't know . They are keeping him overnight for observation . I just don 't know what to do with him . " The last thing I remember before the blackout ... " ... was holding my hands over Kayleigh 's ears . " I think I was more focused on her hands and mine ... " than the mailbox across the street . " Mom thinks hypnosis might be a good way to remember what ... " Damn it . Jason Treborn . What the hell ! Dad 's Death Certificate . Certificate of Death . My grandfather was crazy too ? Breath in .. and breath out .. and relax . You are completely asleep . Relaxed . I want you to take me to the time when you were in the woods with Lenny . Think of it like a movie . You can pause , .. rewind .. or slow down any details you wish . - Understand ? - Yes . Where are you now ? I 'm standing next to Kayleigh , my hands are over her ears . Are you hurting her ? No , I 'm protecting her . OK . Let 's move forward in time . What do you see ? I see a car . Yes Evan .. tell me about the car . Go on .. nothing can hurt you Remember , it 's only a movie . You 're completely safe . I can 't . The car vanishes , and all of a sudden I 'm on the ground in the woods . The car doesn 't vanish Evan . The movie in your head is broken , that 's all . Now , tell me about the car . I can 't . It 's coming ... Fight it Evan , hurry ! It 's coming ! - Lenny ! - Oh my God ! On the count of ten , you 're going to wake up , .. feeling refreshed , .. and remembering everything we talked about . - Make it stop ! - One .. you 're feeling awake . Two .. your eyes are not feeling as heavy . Five .. six .. come on Evan wake up ! Nine .. ten .. God ! What happened ? Did it work ? Thanks Mom , see you later . Wipe that sad ass look off your face before you get us busted . Did you see the way Evan 's mom was looking at you ? Sorry . Alright . Will someone tell me already what happened with the mailbox ? Don 't you ever bring that shit up again . Not ever ! Let 's go . Are you OK ? Holy shit ! Look at that fat fuck ! - He 's got bigger titties than Lenny 's mom ! - Shh ! Shut up faggot . Who 's talking to you ? I 'm sorry Kayleigh this was a bad idea . You really don 't remember anything that happened ? You 're so lucky . Look , everything is going to be OK . Lenny will be fine .. you 'll see . Sorry . It 's not your fault . Miss Kagan called Dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny . Your Dad did that ? I deserve a lot worst . What are you talking about ? What you deserve is a better father and brother . All they do is make you feel like shit . You really have no clue how beautiful you are , do you ? What the fuck are you doing ? Buying popcorn , what the fuck are you doing ? Oops ... I can 't believe that you just did that ? Stop it ! Stop hitting him ! What 's wrong with you ? Will somebody please help us ? Now OK kid .. you 're outta here . The peaceful town of Bryerville was rocked this afternoon in the wake of a horrible act of vandalism . While the police in upstate New York believes this was a simple act of criminal mischief gone awry .. the tragedy has clearly devastated the community . Now this was the grisly aftermath of a powerful explosion believed to have been caused by an unknown quantity of dynamite . Police has no leads , no suspects , and no motive for the ... Good night . We 're moving . Can 't believe Tommy 's still pissed at me . He knows I 'm moving away right ? He 's been acting real strange lately . He won 't even look me in the eyes anymore . Duck , here they come . Did you mom say if Lenny was OK ? He must be . I mean , they let him out right ? Welcome home . Though you might like some fresh air for a change . Is Tommy with you guys ? No .. it 's cool . So what did you do in there ? It was awful . Can 't sleep because everybody 's screaming all night long . I never want to go back . Do you see that ? Yeah ... what 's up with the smoke ? Crockett ! What are you doing with my dog ? Look what you make me do ! ? What the hell 's wrong with you ? Kayleigh ! Come on , please wake up ! Wake up please ! Wake up ! What don 't you fucking kiss her , Prince Charming ? How long was I out ? Kayleigh , what 's wrong ? Oh my God ! I 'm sorry . And time .. put your pencils down and place your blue books on my desk before you leave . You too Mr. Nelson , we 're all on the same time zone here . So how did do Evan ? I don 't know . I may have some of the stories mixed up . Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog to lick his nuts ? You 're a typical psych major . A complete wise ass . And how 's you project been coming ? You still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory simulation ? I don 't really have a choice . God , it smells like an ass lives here . Cricket , this is my well-mannered roommate , Evan . Yeah .. You 're the man that fucked up the bilker over my anthropology final . See you later Thumper . - Right . - Fucking dick ! Ah ... sweet girl . Here 's you shirt bro . Oh , you sick fuck . Alright man , get dressed . You 're taking me out . Why , what did you do ? Ace another mid-term ? No . Better than that ! Seven years no blackouts . Fuck you bro , let do this . Be gentle with me , be gentle , I 'm tender ... Nice . Look at this fucking guy . Fuck out of my bar . So which one of you has the pet worm ? Worms .. plural . Ah ... that 's so gross . Talk to him about it . He got the fetish . Watch it . It 's a psych project actually , a study on memory loss . That 's explain for all the excitement that I had . Ten bucks says he eats it off the floor . Well , it 's like to figure out how the memories in the simple worm function should help me understand the complexities of the human brain . Let me get that shot . What the fuck weirdo ? Well , this ends your game . Smells like sex in here . Yeah .. Thumper had a busy afternoon . You kidding . He 's so big . Yeah ? Well I guess charisma and I let it go a long way . You want a beer ? Yeah . You got any incense or scent candles or something ? Wo .. No ! Most guys usually tuck porn under their bed . All you 've got are comp books ? Yeah .. they 're my journals . I 've been keeping them since I was seven . Read me something . Maybe I 'll get some fun out of this . Here we go . Looks like my mind refuses to believe what I 'm seeing . .. hearing Crockett make those awful screams . Just writing about it gives me the shivers . Come on . Go on . It was kinda like Tommy was possessed or something . There was a hate in his eyes and .. Are you OK ? Where am I ? What the hell is going on ? I can 't get it opened . Drop it ! Or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep . I got him , Lenny . Save Crockett ! Listen to me Evan .. you listen to me good . There is a million other sisters in the world why do you have to fuck with mine ? It 's OK , it 's just a dream . It didn 't feel like a dream . Maybe because they never do . So Don Juan , do you pass out on all your dates ? Lenny ? I got a surprise for you . You 'll never guess who 's here . Hey , it 's me . Evan . You 're working on .. a model ? Look ... I see that you 're busy so I 'll try to make this quick . Remember that day at the junkyard when we were kids ? I was just hoping you could help me remember . Just any details on how .. I couldn 't cut the rope . Yeah . .. that 's good . Anything else ? Drop it or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her asleep ! Jesus Christ . It really happened . Wow .. er Make one peep , .. and I swear it 'll be your last , motherfucker . The last thing I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh 's ears . I think I was more focused on her hands , on mine , than on the mailbox .. across the street . Maybe it went out . Should someone check it ? Yeah , you do that Lenny . Make one peep and I swear it 'll be your last , motherfucker . How is my sweet girl ? How is my sweet girl ? You need a change don 't you ? You want to open it ? You want to ... Oh my God ! Shit ! Come on ! Fuck , Lenny come on ! Lenny come on ! Come on Lenny let 's go ! Beast man .. fucking brutal . What the f ... ? Hello ? Hello , who is this ? Miss Kagan , it 's Evan .. Treborn I hope you know how much you upset Lenny . Yeah .. I 'm .. look I 'm really sorry about that .. It took me over an hour to clean up the mess you made . Can .. can I just talk to Lenny ? Don 't call here . Mom . I can 't help it , I 'm just so proud of you . Hey did .. Did Dad ... Jason get good grades ? He got straight A 's without ever touching a book . It was the one area his memory never failed him . Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall his lost memories ? Years after he blacked them out ? Why do you ask ? No , I just figured with him being such a brain and all . You would think that he would figure out a way to remember stuff that he forgot . Well , when he was your age , almost exactly your age , come to think of it , he said he figured out a way to remember his past . I couldn 't tell if they were real memories or just his imagination . Then , just before it got so bad , he .. had to be institutionalized , he said he could ... What ? Look What did he do ? Forget it . It 's nothing . He was far too sick by then . Come on , Mom . What did he say that he could do ? What do you say ? As a goof . No , Mom , come on . On yourself , it 'll be fun . All right . It 's your darn . Give me your hand , young man . This is supposed to be your trick . Have you ever have your palm read before ? No , it 's the first time , so be gentle please . What ? You have no life line . You don 't belong here . For an extra 5 bucks she 'll spit in your face , Mom . No , really , what 's his future ? He has no soul ! You were never meant to be . Psychic , huh ? Then this won 't come as a shock to you . Thank you . No problem . When did you start smoking again ? Lay off , Evan . Hey . What ? You are not going to allow that the old hag to ruin the rest of our time together ? She 's nuts , she 's a lunatic . It 's like an act . - They just do that - I know . I 'm sorry , she just hit a nerve . Well , why ? I don 't get it . Before you were born I was pregnant twice and they were both still births . Why didn 't you ever tell me that ? It 's not something I like to remember . And then when I was pregnant with you ... I was terrified . I had to expect the worst . And ? And he came out fine . And ever since then , I have considered you my little miracle baby . Don 't cry . Come on , let 's go . It 's late . I didn 't want to be in the movie anyway . It was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes . But Mr. Miller took my shirt off . What the fuck are you doing ? Shh .. I need quiet for this . Are you stupid or what man ? Maybe there 's a reason you repressed the day some pervert had you in your tidy whities . I 'd think twice about what you are doing . You could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now . More fucked up than I already am . You think you know me ? I don 't know me ! No , it 's my fault . Can you get through one damn day without breaking something ? Hey ! Evan ! Oh my God , it 's been a long time . How 've you been ? Same old , you know .. No , I don 't know . Fill me in . Well .. I 'm going to state now .. It 's going good . My mom 's good . You want a smoke ? No , not since we were kids . I quit like a hundred times . Are you walking home ? Can I walk you ? Sure . My God . So .. how 's Tommy ? Well they kept him in juve for a few years , but .. now he is working over at Dell 's Auto body . That 's cool . Still living with your Dad ? No I emancipated myself at fifteen . Must have taken a lot of courage . Not if you remember my Dad . Couldn 't you just have moved in with your Mom ? No , she had a new family . Wasn 't enough room . Whatever . The reason I came back to town is to talk to you . To me ? Why ? Well , .. remember when we were kids and I used to have those blackouts ? Yeah , of course . Some of those memories have been coming back to me and I just wanted to talk to you about one of them in particular . I 'll try to remember . When we were kids , your Dad was making a movie about Robin Hood , or something . What do you want to know Evan ? Did he ... what happened in the basement ? Look , it was a long time ago . I know . Is that why you came all the way back here ? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood ? No . I just think that something really bad might have happened . Is there a point to any of this ? Look , whatever happened , it wasn 't our fault . We were kids , and there is nothing that we could do to deserve what he has done . Just shut up , Evan ! You 're wasting your breath . You can 't hate yourself because your dad is a twisted freak . Who are you trying to convince Evan ? You come all the way back here to stir my shit just because you have a bad memory ? What ? Do you want me to just cry on your shoulder and tell you everything is all better now ? Well fuck you Evan ! Nothing is all better OK . Nothing ever gets better . You know ? If I were so wonderful Evan , .. why didn 't you call me ? Why did you just leave me here to rot ? Some dude left a message for you . You can smell that all the way to the bathroom . Hi Evan this is Professor Carter . Just wondered why you didn 't hand in your essay this afternoon . I was a bit concerned . Call me to schedule a makeup . What did you say to my sister , motherfucker ? Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour . She said you came and saw her last night . She ... She fucking killed herself tonight . She 's dead . And so are you . If the scar on my stomach didn 't come out of nowhere .. maybe my father wasn 't as crazy as everyone thought . If I can make scars , do I have the power to heal them ? What about Kayleigh 's scars ? I never wanted to be in the movie anyway It was cold . So I wanted to wear my clothes . .. but Mr. Miller .. took my shirt off . I 've got an idea . Let 's go down to the basement . It 'll look more like a dungeon down there . A little light here . Hey , what did I tell you about keeping the door shut ? But I want to see . You 'll see the back of my fist in two seconds if you don 't do as I tell you . Now , in this part of the story Robin Hood had just married Maiden Marianne and they have to kiss and stuff like the grown ups do . So , take off you clothes Kayleigh . Come on , just like when we take a bath . Don 't make a big deal out of it . You too Evan . Come on let 's go , let 's go ! We 're making a movie here . Put your hands on your ears . What time is it ? It 's time for you to do what I tell you to do . Wrong answer fuckbag ! This is the very moment of your reckoning . In the next thirty seconds you 're gonna open up one of two doors . The first door , you 'll forever traumatize your own fresh and blood . What 's happening ? How are you doing this ? It will change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick paedophile father . Ultimately , it will lead to her suicide . Nice work Daddy . Who are you ? Let 's just say you 're being closely watched , George . Your other option is to treat Kayleigh like ... .. say like a loving father treats his daughter . Sound OK to you Papa ? Yes . Listen close then , fuckbag . You screw this up again , I 'll flat out castrate you . What you need to do , is discipline your son Tommy ' cause the kid is one sadistic pup . A last thing . Don 't ever touch me again . No , I won 't . Faster , faster .. Crockett ! I will return to look for you Kayleigh I can 't believe you came ! .. you got that one .. Check out our new house .. Honey , are you alright ? Oh my God Evan , you 're bleeding ! Kayleigh ! it 's .. you . Incredible ! Thanks , go get cleaned up and come back to bed . Where are my clothes ? These are your clothes silly . Bathroom ? Hurry up , I want a quickie before school . What ? Unbelievable ! I wish I could get so excited over a nose bleed . Sorry , eh ... I didn 't see you . Wait .. you 're the girl that was with those assholes throwing popcorn at Thumper . What ? .. and your name is Gwen ! I know you . Seriously Evan , lay off the blow . Hi . Don 't freak out when I ask you this but do you remember when your dad got that video camera ? Yeah .. em .. I think he had it like the first day , and then he gave it away . Why would that freak me out ? I don 't know . Just being weird . You are such a goofus . So I 'll see you tonight . OK . Come on mom . Andrea , Evan and Chuck aren 't home right now . You know what to do . Hey mom , it 's me ... and hey , Chuck . I just called to say hi . Give me a call back . Hey Thumper , do you know what time is , man ? What 's the matter , you lost your Rolex ? Fuck you frat boy ! Remember everyone , there 's only two more weeks until your psych projects are due . About that essay that I missed last week you 're still OK with the extension right ? And you are ? Evan ... Treborn The answer is no Mr. Treborn , please take your seat , the exam is about to begin . Settle down everyone . The exam will begin in 1 minute . Get off me , asshole . You guys started that shit . Evan , you 're hysterical . Did you study for this ? We 'll find out . Me neither . Holy shit . Are these the answers ? Damn Evan , keep it on the down ! I want to do something special for Kayleigh tomorrow night . So if I said I needed some help from you and the brothers . That don 't bother me . Get the pledges to do it . Right , the pledges . You may begin now ! That was so good . Oh my God . Where did you learn those new tricks ? Why ? It wasn 't weird , was it ? Yeah if you call multiple orgasms weird . Hello ? Fuck ' em . What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect . I mean .. why did you sneak out to visit me after I moved away . Because I missed you . Why ? Did you think my Dad could have stopped me from seeing you ? What you 're going to do ? Oh my god , my toes are numb . Do you think that we 'll be together forever ? That is the plan , isn 't it ? Hell or high water ? Yeah . Yeah . I was just making sure . Yeah .. that 's the plan ! Alright . All you rushes , you know what you have to do for me . Pledges .. we 're pledges , sir . .. brother Evan .. er .. sir . Are you kidding me ? What ? What did you say to me ? Give me the Greek alphabet . Give it to me ! Alpha , beta , gamma , delta , epsilon zeta , eta , theta , iota , kappa , lambda , mu , nu , xi , omicron , pi , ro , sigma , tau , epsilon , phi , chi , psi , omega , sir ! Omega , Sir ! .. maybe that 's what it is ! Don 't fucking look at me . Look down ! Alright .. em .. you pledges know what to do for me and you guys go take a shower , and if anyone gives you any trouble .. you tell ' em I said it was OK . What ? Shower up bitch ! I don 't understand where are you taking me ? I am not telling you . Oh my God ! Wow .. it 's beautiful . Go on , sit down . Thank you . Why are you doing this for me ? When I woke up this morning .. I saw your smile . .. that smile . And I knew .. that I wanted to spend the rest of my life .. with you . I 've been looking all over for you man . Someone trashed your car ! What the fuck .. Who did this ? Who did it ? It 's probably those beta fuckers . No .. no ... How did somebody get away with this , right in front of the frat house ? Dude , what is that ? A dog collar ? Tommy . Don 't . He might be watching . It 's my fault , I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago . Yeah , that would 've been nice . Like this would do any good . Maybe one of the frat guys got a gun . Evan , don 't even joke . He 's not going to hurt you OK . He 's just trying to scare you away from me . He killed my dog . You don 't remember that ? Evan , it 's not his fault . You know how bad he had it when we were kids . Oh no , don 't give me this bad up-bringing shit . You turned out just fine . My father never laid a hand on me . It 's like that prick saved it all for Tommy . Alright . We 'll let campus security deal with it . You know , I should sleep alone . No , you are not staying alone . I 'm staying with you . Evan , I just don 't want Tommy to see us together right now . No , I lost you once and I 'm not losing you again . What do you mean you lost me once ? Evan , you never lost me ! What are you talking about ? God , you 've been acting so weird lately . Look , my car just got racked OK . I 'm kind of freaked out . I know that but .. .. your accent 's changed , you don 't even walk the same . I walk differently ? I mean that dinner tonight , it was so beautiful , gorgeous , but it just wasn 't .. you . Can 't I do something nice to you ? Wait . Isn 't that your jacket ? You stay away from us you sick fuck . Oh , get this " us " shit . Like I 'd ever lay a hand on my own sister . You 've done real nice for yourself , Evan . You 've got a nice life . You got nice friends . Not to mention you 're fucking my sister . Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself . Shut up Tommy ! Oh come on that 's a compliment . What are you doing man ? What the fuck ? It 's not good enough that the whole fucking world loves you . But you got to take the only thing on this earth that doesn 't think I 'm a piece of shit . Tommy you knows I love you . No one thinks you are a piece of shit . Oh what was it you said ? I believe it was er .. .. sick fuck ! Tommy ! Tommy ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Oh my God ! Tommy , no ! Stop ! Oh my God ! No , Evan ! Stop ! Stop it ! You 're gonna kill him ! He 's a fucking maniac ! You ruined Lenny 's life ! You killed Crockett ! You killed that woman and her baby ! Now you are trying to kill me . You are trying to fucking kill me ! Oh my God ! Oh my god what have you done ! Go ! First time ? Yeah Better not bitch up man . You wind up someone 's luggage that way . Can you protect me ? Jesus himself couldn 't make me stand up against the brotherhood . Look man . When they come , you go some place else in your head . Be somewhere else . Back up you ass . Go away . Yo ! Give me . Give me that ! I spoke to your lawyer .. and , he 's sure he can get you off on self defence . So if you 're just patient ... Mom . How long will I be in here ? I don 't know . These things take time . What about the journals ? Did you bring me those that I asked you to bring ? I found these two . The others are still in storage . Mom ! I ... I need them all , all of them . And I 'm gonna get them to you . But right now , .. you need to concentrate on the case . Please . Alright . You 're right . What about Kayleigh ? Is she alright ? Try to tell her I 'm sorry . Time 's up . I 'm not gonna lose you again . Promise me you 'll hang on . Shit on my dick , or blood on my knife ? They 're mine ! Rotten ass ! Break up ! Get back ! Fuck off ! Show 's over ladies . Take this maggot back to his cell . We 'll be seeing you later on tonight little sister . " Today I found my grandfather 's ... " ... death certificate . " He died in a nut house , just like my father . " Mom denied this , but she thinks I 'm gonna end up the same way " . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! Come on , Reese . You 're religious Carlos . You believe in that whole bit " The Lord works in mysterious ways " ? Straight up man . 'Cause I think Jesus sent me to your cell for a reason . For you to help me . Shit . I knew you were crazy , man . I ain 't bullshittin ' . Jesus speaks to me in my dreams . Oh yeah ? That 's cool ! Man . A pack of smoke says I can prove it to you . I need you to watch may hands and face closely . You need to see the prison shrink , man . Just tell me if you see anything weird . Weirder than this ? It could be marks , could be scars , could be anything . I don 't know . " On Wednesday I got into trouble for a drawing I didn 't do . " Mommy won 't let me see it . " Hey , no monkey business Evan . Sit down and finish your drawing . That 's great everyone ! Just imagine what you want to be . There 's no limits . Oh Mrs. Boswell ! Sweet Jesus ! It 's a miracle ! Look at the Stigmata , man ! What did you see ? What did it look like ? The signs of Lord man . They just come out of nowhere ! I thought you were fucking crazy man ! So now you believe me . Straight up man . Want to make a deal ? Right , look . I 'm new here , but I think I get how things work . You either join a gang or you 're dead . Well I 'm not joining up with no spics or niggers . And I don 't want to die . So , .. what do I got to do ? I 'm the new guy , I got to work my way up . So .. .. should I suck your dick now ? Or ... Is your blood ... pure ? Well , I 'm no fucking kike . If that 's what you 're asking me . Well then , let 's see what you got , honey . And wash the fucking teeth or you 'll be leaving without them . Yes , sir . Come to daddy . The doors ! Carlos ! " We took the woods around the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn 't bump into Tommy . " We hadn 't seen the smoke yet . " Hold them ! " We took the woods around the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn 't bump into Tommy . " We hadn 't seen the smoke yet . " Right , you fucking animals ! Wait before we .. .. we need something that we can open the sack . I want you to take this Lenny . Today is your day of atonement . I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby . Evan , stop it . It 's not the time . Now 's the only time . Today you get a chance to redeem yourself , to start all over with a clean slate . What are you talking about ? Evan , you 're acting crazy ! Please , if you ever trusted me before , trust me on this one . Cut the rope . Come on ! Listen to me good Evan . I will do whatever you want . If you don 't want me to see Kayleigh again , fine . Just let Crockett go . Besides , if you kill him now , they 'll sink you in juve for sure . And I know you 'd never leave your sister alone with your father . Lenny , No ! No . Oh my God , Lenny . I said cut the rope . It 's all backward . Who did it ? Son of a bitch ... Lenny , No ! Want a ride ? Somebody call 911 ! Evan ! Evan ! Fuck it ! Evan ! This is not so simple . Hey doc ! What 's the damage ? How much time do I got ? Cute Evan . It 's a little complicated . I haven 't seen results like this before . Not even with my father ? Well actually they didn 't have these tests twenty years ago . So what did you find ? We 're finding most of the haemorrhaging is coming from here the outer layer of cerebral cortex . That 's where the memories are stored , Mom . Thank you , Evan . I 've never seen anything like it . We compared these with the ones taken last year .. we found severe haemorrhaging .. and massive neural reconstruction . And what does that mean for Evan ? What he said Mom is I 've jammed forty years of memories into my head in the last year . It 's overloaded silly . I 've completely reprogrammed my brain . Is that about the gist of it , Doc ? Yeah . I going to wait in the car . The lighting here kind of bugs my eyes . It 's good seeing you , doc . I found this ... really ... really informative . But you know .. I 've got people to see , things to read . Bye , see you . It 's me . Evan . Can I get you anything ? What about ... What about some of those model airplanes you like ? I bet I can ship some of those model airplanes up in here . Lenny . You knew the whole time , didn 't you ? When you put that shard in my hand . You knew something big was going to happen . Didn 't you ? Yeah . I knew . And you should be where I am . You should be .. .. where I am . " Today I get to meet my father . " His name is Jason . " And he 's crazy . " I hope he lets me call him Dad . " You OK ? because you look .. .. like you went somewhere else there for a second . Look Jason ! I need some fast answers from you if I am ever going to fix what I 've done . I was praying this curse would 've ended with me . Yeah , but it didn 't . So now I need information to make things right again . And you 're the only one that can give it to me . There is no right ! You can 't change who people are without destroying who they were . Who says you can 't make things better ? You can 't play God son . It must end with me . Just by being here , you may be killing your mother . That 's bullshit , you know . I 'll send you a postcard when I 've made everything perfect again . I will ... - Just got out , did you ? - Hm ? No nothing , it 's just that my brother did a stint in the pen , and he used to eat like that . I come from a big family . Well , I meant no offence . None taken . Hey ... Did Kayleigh Miller still work here ? Sorry , I never heard of her . Can 't a man get a little goddamn peace in his own house ? I don 't suppose you 're here to sell cookies ? Good guess , fuckbag . You remember me ? We had a nice chat once when I was seven . I got one question for you . Where can I find your daughter ? Oh , I thought you were someone else . Make it fast , I 'm expecting someone . It 's good to see you . Can I come in ? If I knew you were coming , I would 've cleaned the stains off the sheets . What do you want ? Just needed to see a friendly face . Well , .. time is money Evan . Money . Guess I can spare ten minutes for an old friend , right ? So ? How 's tricks ? Sorry ! Occupational humour . I got it . You stop , now . Oh sorry . Does my line of work make you uncomfortable , precious ? No . Just that .. you felt like you had to use it to hurt me . I 've been where you 've been . Ha .. where is that ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . I know , people always say that , you wouldn 't believe me , but .. in this case , it 's not any more tried . I knew I needed to find you . So I went up to Dad and made him tell me . Then I came here , and the rest , you know . You 're right Evan , I don 't believe you . I never though you would . That 's why I never bothered to tell a soul until now and I never will again . I 'm the only person you 've told ? That 's a great one . Does that make other girls wet ? Do they actually eat up that bullshit ? You know , I couldn 't give a shit whether you believe me or not . Frankly , I 'm too tried to prove it to you . Oh there 's proofs now huh ? How else would I know that you have twin moles on your inner thigh ? Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that . Ok . Forget that . How about the fact that you prefer the smell of skunk to flowers .. or you hate Cilantro .. because for some reasons unknown to you it reminds you of your step-sister . .. or that when you have an orgasm , your toes go numb . I 'm sure all of your clients know that . You know .. I just thought you should know . Know what ? That you were happy once . .. with me . You know , there is one major hole in your story . There is no fucking way on this planet , or any other , I would ever be in some fucking sorority . You were happy then . Oh you are crying . You sure you don 't need your wallet ? No , I don 't need it where I 'm going . Why are you off to change everyone 's life again ? Is that it ? Maybe next time you 'll pop up in some mansion .. while I end up in Tijuana doing some donkey act . You know , I 'm over it . Every time I try to help someone , .. everything just goes to shit . Don 't give up now , slick . Hell , you 've already done so much for me . Why don 't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby ? And then maybe , Lenny wouldn 't freak out and ruin my family . No , go back to when I 'm seven .. and fuck me in front of my Daddy 's video camera . Straighten me out a bit . You 're on my bed , get out ! Buddy , I thought you 're OK , what with you being sick and all . I 'm not going to say it again . " The last thing I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh 's ears . " I think I was more focused on her hands , on mine , than the mailbox across the street . " Lady stay back . Don 't go near the mailbox . Idiot ! I mean it , get the hell back ! I 'll save you lady ! Goddamn it . I thought I told you two to get out . Sorry man , did we wake you ? No , it 's cool . It 's really cool . What the fuck is this ? .. save his arms ! .. goes to the movies , can I come too ? What 's happening Evan ? Kayleigh get some help ! Evan ! Oh my God . Evan ! Evan ! Did you ever notice Kayleigh 's smile . I love your smile . Lenny is the best . You 're going to make a great couple . You believe that I will find someone ? Evan ! Where are we going ? We 're taking you to the hospital , Evan . No , take me back ! Sorry , your mother would kill me . You take me back , Lenny ! You owe me that much . What are you geeks looking at ? Must be nice to be so goddamn perfect , huh ? Fucking losers . Lenny help me . Get him over . Hey hey , Brian ! How 's your head feeling , buddy ? I saw that girl you went home with . Did she borrow your razor this morning ? So bad ! Hey , there 's Tommy . Hey Tommy ! Tommy ! What 's up guys ? Hey man . I did what you said . We 're pulling the student funds from the Halo House and having an awareness dance . Oh awesome . Maybe I can spin my chair around to the techno remix of Halva Negila till I puke . Maybe we should be getting to class now . What 's the point of psych class now ? Tomorrow I can wake up in a dirt farm in Bangladesh . Lets go for a stroll . Bye . Bye sis . Good day ! What 's wrong with him today ? So Tommy is really into this Jesus freak thing . You know how spiritual he has gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katy . He saved Miss Halpern ? Please , this twisted fuck ? Let sit right here . You want a genawa bar ? Here . Yeah .. I got to fix these things . Kayleigh . Do you ever think about us ? I mean , do you ever .. .. wonder if things might have been different .. between us ? Sure Evan . You 're the first person I really ever cared about . I was ? Yeah . That 's why when I was little , I never went to live with my mother . I don 't get it . When my folks split up , they gave me and Tommy a choice of who we want to live with , and I couldn 't stand my Dad . But I knew that if I went to live with my Mom , I 'd never see you again . I didn 't know that . So , you still think about us ? Together ? Well .. it 's crossed my mind from time to time . And ? Well , a lot of things have crossed my mind , Ev . I mean , I can play out the entire movie of our lives in one second . Boom ! we fall in love , we get married , we have kids .. our kids grow old as do we . matching burial plots , the whole thing . Blah ! It took a lot more to spit out than to imagine ! Things like that usually do . So .. do you think that it might have worked ? Yeah . But that 's now how things wound up . I 'm with Lenny . Lenny is your friend , and ... and that 's where it ends . Would it make a difference if I told you that .. no one can possibly ever love anyone as much as I love you ? You know I 'm not saying that ... I 'm just saying it like .. if you were a girl , would that be something that you would want to hear . Hold on one second . Lenny 's complaining , I 'll be right back , OK ? - He 's a little down . He 'll be alright . - I love you . You forgot to put the toaster on the ledge . Lenny likes pop tarts . You guys are all that matter now . I know it 's hard but you can 't give up . I can 't even fucking kill myself . Don 't talk like that . Alright . I got to get you out of here , visiting hours are almost over . Mon got transferred to here ? What are you talking about ? She 's been here the entire time . Looking ... good kiddo . What the hell ? Lung cancer . You started chain smoking when I blew myself up . Sorry , Mrs. T , he 's been acting out of sorts lately . I think I can fix this . Fix ? I just need the journal entry about the blockbuster . Shit , no arms . I never wrote it . You 're ... acting ... different . No , he 's just gone through tough times . Mom . You 're going to be OK . I can change it . Maybe ... I 'm gonna go down to the chapel . You 're acting just like your father . Just because he went crazy when he was my age doesn 't mean I 'm gonna go crazy , Mom . How ... did ... you know that ? You told me ... On Parents Weekend , remember ? It wasn 't me ... - Just ... - Who are you ? ... like ... Jason . Don 't worry , Mom . I 'm going to get you out of here . OK ? No . You 're not going to hurt anymore . I 'm going to fix it . No . Are you sure you even packed it ? My Mom packed it . I have to send it home . - Is this it ? - Yeah . What do you want it for ? I don 't get you lately . Let you know later . Ok , I have to ask you one last favour . What ? I need you to be quiet . I have to concentrate if I want to destroy the blockbuster . The blockbuster ? If I hadn 't blown off my arms , my mom would never have started smoking in the first place . Never mind , just open it . Turn it . There . " Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy . " I will meet their father and see what a real Dad is like . " Now , how do I destroy the blockbuster ? Evan , what are you doing with that knife ? That didn 't work . Turn it . Turn . There . " I never wanted to be in the movie anyway . I felt cold and wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller made me take my shirt off . " In this part of the story , Robin Hood .. has just married Maid Marianne . .. and they have to kiss and stuff , like grownups do . Wait , I need my belt . Hey , don 't even bother about a belt . - Hey ! - Back off , fuckbag ! Amazing that word never fails to make an impression with you . Easy does it , Evan . Don 't be a bad boy , or I 'll tell your mother what a naughty little shit you are . And I will tell child protector services about your little kiddie porn in there . One step closer and I 'll shove this up your ass . Hey , that 's dangerous , you could blow off your hand . Been there , done that . Sparkler ! Kayleigh ! No ! Hey man . .. good kiddo .. .. this boy must be cared for in a psychiatric hospital What did you see ? A squashed butterfly . I 'm so sick of this ! .. finished your program ? Can I have my medication now ? Where are my goddamn books ? Evan ? We 're not suppose to meet for another hour . Where are my goddamn books ? Books ? My journals . I need them . So .. give them to me . It 'll help a lot . It really hurts me to go through this again . There are no journals . There never were . It 's part of the fantasy world that your mind created to cope with the guilt .. of killing Kayleigh Miller . Think Evan , think . You 've created a disease that does not exist . Alternate universes with colleges and prisons and paraplegia .. I want my journals , and I want them now ! And I know that you 've got them and you 've got to give them to me . You 're not going to hide them from me . I want them ! You 're reminding me of your father . He was always screaming for a photo album , even though he never had one . I 'm so sorry . I 'm not ... Photo album ? Photos . The damage is irreparable . Frankly I 'm surprised that he still has use of his motor functions . Mom . Did you remember to bring those home movies that we used to make ? Yeah . They 're right here . Good , because I really like to watch them . So that 's good . I think it 's best we transfer him to Bellevue first thing in the morning . Anyone finds this .. .. it means that my plan didn 't work . .. and I 'm already dead . He 's not in his room . Search the grounds ! .. if I can somehow go back .. to the beginning of all of this . .. I might be able to save her . Evan ! Over here ! Evan ! I believe he is inside . Evan ! Jason , cut it up . I 'm trying to have a baby . Evan ! Open up ! Go away Something is wrong ! It 's killing me ! Make it stop ! Her heart rate is accelerating . What 's happening ? You have no life line , no soul . You were never meant to be . He is choking himself ! No ! Ok , let 's do a sequence intubation for a C-section . Save him ! She 's not getting enough oxygen ! - We 're losing him ! We 're losing him ! - No ! Before you were born I was pregnant 3 times but they were all stillbirths . I kind of thought of you as my miracle baby ever since . Not again ! No ! I couldn 't stand my dad but I knew if I went to live with my mom I 'd never see you again . Kayleigh , Tommy ! I missed you ! I never let you out of my sight again . True happiness can only be achieved through sacrifice . Like the sacrifices our parents have made for us to be here today . Hey ! Tommy !

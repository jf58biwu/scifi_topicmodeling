 Previously on Farscape ... I finally figured out wormholes . I can get you home . If I knew where home was or ... where we are . You might not wanna come with us . We are not the best traveling companions . Aeryn , we haven 't heard from . Has she contacted you ? No , not yet . What do you want from me ? What I want ... may not be as bad as you think . What are you doing ? ! My interrogations are much more agreeable than Scorpius ' methods . He 'll never bother you again . Bury him . Elack ... if we don 't find the strength , it 's all been for nothing . I will find them again , and when I do they will pay for this humiliation . I 've said good-bye to everyone . I can 't make any of you stay . You have more courage , integrity ... and honesty than a dozen Vellas . And I should have said that to her . So ... any response from Moya ? Not yet . We 're hunted by Peacekeepers ... lost in the Uncharted Territories with no purpose in life . One of us has a purpose . Don 't you , Crichton ? You 're right . I do have a purpose . And now on Farscape ... No sign of Moya yet ? Nothing . No response on the comms . So , why don 't we land ? I am starving . Isn 't that a planet out there ? Hot and lifeless . Do you eat rock ? Right now ? I think I could . You ate only three solar days ago . How inefficient is your body ? How edible ... is yours ? I can see there 's not much meat on there ... but I 'm sure there 's a lot of chew on your noggin . Oh , damn . How do you roll a window down in this place ? I should 've stayed on the module . Should have left him on the module . Ohh . I need food . We all need food , Buckwheat . You don 't hear the rest of us fumigating the joint . Here . What 's that ? Jilnak . Very good for you . Give it to Mikey there , he 'll eat anything . - More ? - Hey , what do you know ? Mikey likes it . One portion a piece . Three stomachs ... three portions , no ? It 's not bad . It 's actually quite good . That stuff 's not gonna turn anybody into a newt , is it ? Eat it . It 's Jilnak . Restorative . Ah , if you don 't want it , I ... Rygel ? How come everything tastes like chicken ? What is chicken ? I 'll be back . Don 't you leave without me . Restorative ? You call that a restorative ? Try " purgative " . Here . This 'll help the cramp . You better get away from me before I spew on you . - I ... am inside out . - But you 're not hungry anymore . Okay , where 's Rygel ? Down that hole ... takin ' a giant schlock . Rygel ? Buckwheat ? Rygel ? Hey , Sparky ? ! - You down there ! - Rygel ! Guido ? ! Man , I got one of those ... chunks stuck up in my nose . I hate that . Rygel , what the frell are you doing ? Buckwheat , I thought you came down here to drop some friends off at the pool . I did . I will . Well , do your business and let 's get out of here ... and that stuff belongs to somebody else . We have enough enemies already . I thought you said the planet is lifeless . On the surface , yes ... but down here ... What 's this ? Medicines ! Oh , great . Another klepto . No , no , no , no , no . These markings are familiar . I 've seen them before somewhere , but where ? I ... - Who cares ? Let 's get out of here . - Exactly . Help ! Help ! - Watch it ... trip lights everywhere , D ! - I know , I see them . No ! ... Booby-traps ... I can 't move . Help me ... get me out ! D 'Argo ! Crichton ! Will someone frelling answer ? ! Stand clear ! It 's no good . Somebody help me , I 'm stuck ! We 're all stuck . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 nnnnnn Oh , I really need to schlock . My bowels hate me . I hate you ! Get me out ! Do something ! I 'm open to suggestions . Where have I seen these markings before ? On Cavari , yes ... no , not Cavari . It must have been Eldor II . D , we may have to stick Granny in a home . I think we should burn her . You burn your old folks ? No . It just ... sounded like a good idea . Wait . You hear that ? Sparky , shut up ! Don 't forget to kill the traps . Oh , of course not . Traps are off . I don 't know why they make us set the traps in the first place ! Plague ... Children sick and dying ... then soldiers came with provisions ... Come on , Frool ... get . - Tarkans ! These belong to the Tarkans ! - Yo , Grandma , come on ! Go ! I tell you , I tell you , the Tarkans ... Play dead . Crichton , don 't-don 't leave me ! Don 't ! - I remember now ... Tarkan freedom fighters ... - Shht , shht ... Zip it ! Come on , we still got a lot of crates to move . How come I always gotta do the heavy lugging ? Because you 're not smart enough to do anything else . That 's why . - Oh , well why are you here ? - Because I 'm not smart enough to hang out with anyone else . Okay ... do you think we can take ' em out ? I don 't know , what if they got friends downstairs ? I 'll take these two , you can take their friends . What if there 's a hundred of ' em ? Of these guys ? We should be so lucky . Look at this ! No violence , these are Tarkans ! - Somethin ' set off the traps . - Yeah , and got itself stuck . Will you come on ... Is it dead ? Smells dead ... but it 's not ... yet . Gentlemen ... I apologize for disturbing your work . If you 'd be so kind as to ... get me free , I 'll be on my way . It speaks . It steals too . Any more of you ? No , I 'm all alone . - Yeah , I can see why . - Come on ! We 've captured an intruder ! It claims it 's all alone . - Is it armed ? - No . But it 's sure making some strange noises . Don 't touch it . Wait for me , I 'm on my way . You , come with me . What are you doing ? Did I not tell you to stay put ? Listen to me ... these are Tarkans , they 're good people . You know Jack about these people , now you stay behind cover ! Greetings , Tarkans . We 're honored to meet you . We mean you no harm . You said you were alone ! I 've ... never seen her before . No . Not alone . There 's a human ... and a Luxan too . Oh , I 've told them of your good works ... but they 're shy . Come on out , it 's all right . Burning ? It 's too good for her . Come on , Crichton ... D 'Argo ? Hey ! Granny ... what are you doing ? You have got to stop wandering off like this . Thanks for lookin ' after her fellas . She 's a little ... You haven 't seen my dog , have ya ? Little Bubba ! You got caught in a trap ? ! Crichton ... get me out ! I got an idea . Why don 't we all put our guns down ... There 's two more ! Stop ! No violence ! No firing ! Oh ! What 's going on down there ? It 's no good ... they 're shielded . They got body armor ? That 's a hell of an invention . How come we don 't have that ? You three ! Get them ! Where are you going ? Don 't leave me . I 'll keep you company . Perhaps I should introduce myself , I am Rygel ... Oh , please ! Don 't hurt me ! Oh , thank you ... this won 't go unrewarded . You-you didn 't finish . Oh , wh-what are you doing ? I 'll catch up . Crichton ? ! Frell . Those lights . I think they were pulse blasts . We gotta help ' em . We have to get to them first . Well you 're a genius ... how ? The cannon on the Luxan ship . Are you tinked ? Only D 'Argo can operate that ship . Maybe there 's another way in . That was some drop . - Down here . I found ' em ! - We got another one ! - Think we lost those two ? - There 's no need for ... Will you listen to me ? These are Tarkan freedom fighters , they 're heroes ! On the planet Cavari there was a deadly plague . The Tarkans defied the quarantine . They brought food , clean water , medicines . They saved thousands of lives . Whatever . They 're angels of mercy , they 're still tryin ' to shoot us . Well , what did you expect ? You walk into their house , you steal , you shoot at them ! In case you hadn 't noticed , they started to shoot at us first ! Right . And they 're gonna keep shooting at us until we die unless we talk to them . So let me mediate ! You know , maybe we should let her try . Nah , she 's gonna get shot . And that would be bad ? Can we ... discuss this ? - So this ... is our intruder ? - One of them . One ? You mean there 's more ? Three more . How did you find this place ? Who told you we were here ? Nobody . We found it by accident . And that Mooka chain just ... fell into your hand by accident too . I was just putting it back . No , please ... no , lava ... oh ! I have the intruders cornered , but I ... I could do with some help . Why ? Shoot ' em ! Well , there 's two of them , and they have two guns . Will this ... Will this belt stop two guns at once ? - I 'm coming up . - No ! I 'll take care of it . You keep moving those crates ! Try to remember we 're on a schedule ! - Describe where you are . - Look , how am I supposed to describe it ? It all just looks like rock to me . I won 't get shot . I trust Tarkans . Everyone knows their reputation . I don 't . Me either . Listen , John . We can 't shoot them , we 're trapped ... Maybe we should let the old lady try and mediate a way out . All right , fine . You 're up . Are you all right ? What 's the matter ? Oh , just a bit tired , that 's all . Grandma ... You okay ? - I think she 's asleep . - Grandma ! This is unbelievable ! What ... can 't cook , won 't bathe , and now she 's narcoleptic . She 's a triple threat . Grandma , get up ! - Any markings on the walls ? - No ! Wait ... yeah . There 's ah ... some ... purple writing but ... I don 't know what it says . Purple ... Grandma ! The intruders are trapped in the small lower alcove ? - Yeah . - Good . I know exactly where you are . Grandma , get up ! Do you see those purple markings ? - Shoot them . - Shoot the markings ? Yes , shoot them . Now ! - Bad news . - Trouble . Somebody 's doin ' the Pompei thing . Let 's go . - Ah , more bad news . - Same dren , different planet . Yeah , we 're trapped ... Again . The lava 's rising , jump ! - Jump ? - Jump ! Yeah , yeah , I can make that , but the uh ... old bat can 't . Old bats can fly . You 're up . All right , look , I lied . I can 't make that jump . You can 't make that jump ... gimme your foot ! Come on . Go ! Okay ... D , grab my hand ! Can 't reach ! I didn 't know you could do that . It takes a bit of practice . I take it you did not find another entrance ? No . What ... are you doing ? Trying to power up this vessel 's cannon . I take it ... your memory is frelled . I told you only D 'Argo can operate this ship . And D 'Argo is a fool if he has not set an override sequence . I don 't think you should be blaming D 'Argo in this instance . - He 's already saved your eema once ... - All right ... fine ... he 's a big and brave warrior . However ... if these controls are locked to his DNA ... it was not particularly smart of him not to have set up an override sequence . Wait ... Wait ... - You 're right . - Yes , Chiana , I usually am . Then we don 't need D 'Argo to run this ship . We just need his DNA . And how to you suggest we get ... ? - The intruders can 't be alive . - Well , they are ! Your miserable lava traps only got one of my men ! Your men are worthless . Do you want to move all these yourself ? ! You 're the one who 's so worried about the schedule . Crichton ? D 'Argo ? ! Can you hear me ? - Rygel , are you all right ? - No ... I 'm dying ... Please , get me out of here before my bowels rupture . Yeah , we 'll do that Sparky . Where are you ? I don 't know , lower level , some cavern ... - big pool of lava and ... - All right , we 'll come get ya . Who 's this ? ! Lou Costello . Who 's this ? My name 's ... Raa 'Keel . And mine is Uta-Noranti-Pralatong . I 'm afraid there 's been a huge misunderstanding which we really must rectify . A misunderstanding ? Yeah , we really shouldn 't be shooting each other . We didn 't come here to rob you guys . Hell , we didn 't know there was anybody on this rock . We 're not your enemies , we know who you are . - You do ? - Yes . Every educated species knows and reveres Tarkan freedom fighters . - Then you approve of our work . - Yep . Absolutely , that thing you guys did on Calimari , that was beautiful , man . That was Nobel Peace Prize material . - Yet you attempted to rob us ! - Only because I did not realize whose stuff it was ! - Had I but known , I ... - Yeah , please accept our apology on that . Listen , why don 't you give us the slug , we 'll punish him appropriately and we are out of your hair . - All right . We 'll release him . - Quickly ! But he doesn 't look well ... you 'd better come and get him . Yeah , we 'd love to do that . Where are you ? Stay where you are ... - I 'll send an escort . - Fine . Find him . - You know , I definitely do not trust this guy . - Me either . - But I got an idea . - But there 's no reason not to trust him . I mean why ? Grandma , zip it . We don 't want to hear what saints the Tarkans are . We are not going in there undefended . So you can either get with the program or you can shut up . Preferably both . What 's your idea ? All right , here 's the thing . I think that we ambush the escort ... we hit ' em with a rock and take his belt . - That is your plan ? - Yeah . To hit him with a rock , when they have these like shield things ? ! The shields work against pulse energy ... - they don 't work against other things . We saw the guy get burned . - Yeah , but not by a rock . All right , let me lay this out for you . - Fire ... is thermal energy . - Okay . Thermal energy is like kinetic energy . A rock has kinetic energy . Ergo , a rock will work . Uh , okay , okay , I 'm with you . I just have , uh ... one small little question . Who is ... Lou Costello ? - Wait ! - What ? I want to help ... - Abbott and Costello , we 've been over this . - Right . That was yours ... so this must be D 'Argo 's . No , no , no . This ... is Crichton 's . This ... is D 'Argo 's . - No living creature could produce that ! - You haven 't met many Luxans , have ya ? Okay ... I should be doing this . Excuse me ... I 'm the one ... that put my hands in the vomit . And I 'm the one who happened to observe D 'Argo 's starting procedure when we left Arnessk . Press ... this , this , that , and those two together . This , this , that ... Power systems at your command , Ka D 'Argo . How do you fire up the cannon ? That I do not know . I 've never seen him use the cannon . Right . Random flailing is pointless , Chiana . Move aside and let me wo ... Hey , I am the one ... that put my hands in the vomit . Okay , you want a turn ? Go get your own vomit . Yes , the powder is ready . - Come through , but don 't inhale . - Okay . - What is it ? Sleeping powder ? - I dunno , she 's pretty vague , but this 'll knock ' em out . - I signed on to haul crates . Not get killed ! - Me too . If I get killed ... all my wives will throw fits . Come on , come on , Frool . Hey , fellas ? Let 's do it ! Oh , yeah , baby . Take it off . I am the flower you are the bee . I am the pod you are the pea . I am the target you are the gun ! I am the woman you are the men . Oh , my god ! Well , you 're not any help . Now ... move aside . All right . - Oh , careful ... - Sorry . You better hurry , you 're losing your vomit . I think I 've decoded the right sequence . Slowly ... Actually ... it 's really quite simple . To a great mind like yours . Okay , fire the cannon . Certainly . I see the pattern . This ... - ... locates the target . - Right . This one primes the charge . And this one ... fires . Really ... quite simple . Frell ! All right , so there 's nothing to turn on . Someone shoots me , and I 'm protected . Yeah . Well , I think we 'd better test it . Do you have any , uh ... small appendages you don 't need ? Small ? Shoot him in the buttock , that 's big . Hey , you know what ? Don 't touch my ass , that 's sexual harrassment . - Whoa , no , we are not shooting the butt ! - Okay . The butt is off-limits , try the heel or ... why don 't we shoot you ? You got a small appendage ! Shoot me ? ! Son of a gun , it works . Now can we go and talk to the Tarkans ? There is no " we " , white girl . We appreciate what you did ... it was different , but we have two belts , three people . You 're stayin ' here , we 're not takin ' chances . Is this thing cutting ' out on me ? Energy save mode . It 'll reactivate when it 's needed . Okay , let 's get out of here . You guys ... show the way . Come on ! Put some clothes on . You don 't understand ... if I don 't take a schlock soon , my insides will explode and I 'll die ! Sur-prise , sur-prize , sur-prise ! What happened ? They ... uh ... have our belts . Yeah , yeah , th-that 's right . I can see that . Sparky , you okay ? - What do you think ? - Just hang in there . Okay , here 's the deal , Tin Man . You can 't hurt us , we can 't hurt you . You 've got our whoopie cushion , we 've got Larry and Moe here . What do you say to a simple trade ? Why would I want these morons back ? - Will you stop shooting my men ? ! - Shut up and stand still . - John ! - I got it . One of those frelling booby traps . You know that thing I said ... about the Nobel Peace Prize for Tarkans ? I take it all back . You think we 're Tarkan freedom fighters . We 're not . We 're robbing them , and you can identify us . Need I continue ? Right , so you 're robbers , whatever . We 're not cops , we don 't care . Actually , we 've performed quite a few burglaries ourselves . Well , you picked the wrong place to burglarize today . Who else is with you ? Ah ... get frelled . There 's an old woman , but she 's no threat . What would you know ? She can 't get out , and no one else can get in . Why prolong her agony ? Save us some time and tell us where she is . Out riding her broomstick . I wonder which is worse ... to burn to death in lava , or to suffocate in a column of Armarak . What do you think ? Try something . I have tried every plausible combination . Well then , try something else ! - Like what ? - Anything ! All right . It 's the Tarkans . They 've come back early . Don 't be stupid . Why would they attack their own race ? Maybe they found our transport . If they blew it up , we 're trapped . It 's well hidden . How could they find it ? That was Lo 'La 's cannon . Someone is in my ship . It 's gotta be the girls . But how did they get your bodily fluids ? Don 't go there . You wanted to know who was with us . You just found out . That was our squad blasting their way in . Your squad ? Yeah . A whole platoon of big hairy guys with really cool tats and more guns than you can count . If they come down here and find us dead ... they 're gonna slit you from crotch to eyeball with a dull deer antler . In other words , we die ... you die . We live , and you might have a chance . You 're lying ! Wait ... if it 's true ... we 're gonna need some hostages . Why now ? Of all the times you could have come here , why now ? ! Do you know how long I 've been planning this ? ! - Life sucks , don 't it . - Well , quite often in fact . Here , take this . If they try anything , throw it at them ! No , no , no , no , no ! Don 't-don 't touch me ! - It 's not my fault . - Don 't touch . - Don 't get angry . - Not angry ... ... Vomit ... vomit . Yes ... we must conserve it . Okay , you stay at the controls . I 'm gonna go down and check things out . It may be an idea to turn the ship invisible . If ... if you can figure out how . You said this 'd be easy . While the Tarkans are off delivering food to the orphans we loot the place then disappear . Gun battles weren 't part of the deal . Stop complaining . You 're wearing a shield belt . We were six ! We 're now three ! Then try and shoot straight you incompetent , it 'd make a nice change . You 're lucky I 'm here at all ! Keep still . Hit a beam and you 'll be trapped like your smelly friend . Mr. Redshirt ... whatever the Tin Man 's paying you , we 'll double it . Come on , you heard what Raa 'Keel said . He doesn 't want any witnesses . Do you think you can walk out of here alive with your share ? Don 't take the chance . Throw in with us , you 'll come out ahead . We 're the good guys . Shut up , or I 'll give you a face full of ... Oh ! Crichton ! Damn , he 's completely encased . Where 's that gizmo ? There . - Do you know how this thing works ? - I dunno , just press the button.Watch where you ... Set it lower ! There ya go . Prop him up so I can grill both sides . Oh , damn it ! I 'm telling you . It couldn 't have been an attack . Probably just a pressure eruption on the surface . Nothing to worry about . Nothing to worry about ? If our transport 's damaged , we 're dead . Check the transport . - What are you doing ? It 's too low . - No , no , it 's right . - It 's too low . Give it more power . What are you doing ... look , look , you 're gonna break . - I think it 's outta juice , and that ... - No , you 're breaking it ! - That is maxed out ! - It 's outta juice . - Oh , great ! Okay , there 's another one of those canisters on the level up top . All right , go get it . Don 't drag your heels , Rygel 's gonna die here on us . Oh , no , no ! Rygel ! Rygel ... Oh , crap ! Eenie , meenie , minie , moe ... Don 't even consider it , John ! You know far too well , the shield belt doesn 't work against lava ! Yeah ... I figured that out . But it might work if it 's already activated . Far too risky ! Look , I put Rygel in there , I 'm gonna have to get him out . He 's already dead . You don 't know that . The amber protects the crates , it might protect Rygel . How long has he been without air ? ! He 's amphibious , he can last . Would you quit buzzin ' around in my head ? You 're givin ' me a headache . Go ! Okay ... Okay ... At least we know I 'm insane . Raa 'Keel ... transport 's fine . Not a scratch . - Did you see anyone ? - No . It had to be a bluff . Then what did this ? I don 't know . What 's the difference ? We 're getting out now before the Tarkans get back . Load up as much as you can . I 'll dispose of the hostages . - Shh , we must hide ! - What 'd you think I was doin ' ? - Shh ! Come on . ... morons ... These aren 't real Tarkans at all , they 're highly evil men ! Oh ? Well , I wouldn 't have guessed . - Come on , let 's get the others and get out of here . - No , it 's not that easy . Our weapons are useless . We have to find the real Tarkans and tell them what 's happening . - Send a message . - Right . Are you klempt ? Come here , come here , come-here ! Hey , these are highly evil men ... right ? Okay ... Sikozu probably doesn 't even know how to work the radio , right ? Hey , where are you going ? Frell her . All right , Sparky , where are ya ? Come on , Bubba . I 'm too old to be playin ' hide and seek . At least that works . Damn , this has gotta be bad for the sperm count . Is that you ? Give me a bubble . Ah ... okay , let 's get you some O2 . Nice use of the shield belt but without that pathetic little weapon ... you 'll burn ! You do not ... talk ... about ... Winona ... like that ! Lift going down ? Whoa , is that a head ? ! Prepare to feel fire ! - Crichton ! - Chiana , shoot ! Not him ! Me ! - What ? - Just shoot me ! Keep shootin ' me . I gotta find Rygel . What 's goin ' on , tell me what ... Can I get a " hell , yeah ! " ? Quickly , quickly ! - I 'm workin ' it ! - Hurry up ! Oh , hezmana ... Oh , man ! Somebody had somethin ' crawl up their ass and die ! - Damn , nobody light a match ! - Or breathe . Or move . No . No wait . These are Tarkans . Good people . - That 's what you said the last time . - No , no , don 't worry . I 've told them all about the robbery and how we 're not their enemies . And they believed you ? Raa 'Keel ... once one of us . Now just a traitor and a thief . I guess they believed her . You 're free to go . As long as you take him with you . - Thanks for the belt . - A pleasure . - And ... thank you for the , uh ... - Jilnak ! Oh , my module is parked in orbit and the meter is running out . Oh , I 'll never eat again . The very thought of food nauseates me . Sork wings ? Crispy Grolack ? Excuse me ... excuse me ! What is this mess ? ! And the smell ! This ... is all you . Well ... from you . Whose idea was this ? Mine . D , why don 't we fire this thing up before the Tarkans realize that Grandma has poisoned them . Merely a cleansing restorative . Not one word . Power systems at your command . A received transmission awaits your review . - We have an answering machine ? - We 've got a message ? - Quick . Play it , play it now ! - Just shut up ! Ka D 'Argo ... Moya and I have recieved your signal . Here is our location . We look forward to your return . It 's Pilot . Repeat ... Moya and I have received your signal . Pilot . Oh ... by the yotz . Moya 's all right . She 's waiting for us . Subtitles : PK SUB-66

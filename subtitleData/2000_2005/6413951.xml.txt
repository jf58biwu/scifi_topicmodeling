 Previously on Farscape . Welcome home , son . Scorpius is here , looking for the key to what is inside my head . He will use you and the baby . Skreeth ? I 'm confident I can capture him , but doubt I can bring him to you . Wherever this Earth is , the journey there is obviously impractical without wormhole travel , and only Crichton can command that . Learn what we can from him , then execute him . Stay . Look , we 'll guard the wormhole . Nothing 'll get through . No , I have a job to do . It 's over . There 's nothing more between us . Nothing . And now on Farscape . Pilot : We have reached the optimal departure point . D 'Argo , Rygel and Scorpius are boarding Lo 'La . Chiana , Sikozu and Noranti are already in a Transport Pod . Tell ' em we 're coming . Merry Christmas . Is there something that comes with this ? It 's big . It 's taking over your room . Okay , tell ' em we 're not coming ! We 're gonna stay . We 'll watch TV , we 'll eat popcorn , we 'll act like normal people . Captain D 'Argo is asking where you are . I gotta go . I gotta go look after Scorpius . We should do it together . No , you know we can 't do that together . Besides , you gotta look after the girls . That 's not fun . It 's more fun than mental-arts training camp . Don 't know . You could do with the mental discipline . Ha . Not from someone Scorpy recommends . You got the better job . What , rummaging around on a dead Leviathan settlement looking for a Moya part ? Oh , that 's infinitely more thrilling . I 'm sorry , but now Chiana is inquiring where you are Officer Sun . I 'm coming , Pilot . We gotta go . Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . Katoya : You have all come to my dwelling to learn . Your objective is mental discipline . To focus your whole mind on a single task is a skill few ever achieve . How much did we pay for this ? The Task Chairs provide access to a mindscape , where you 'll compete with an opponent to the point of great pain . Embrace the pain and you shall succeed . Retreat , and suffer the consequences . If you have any self-doubt , you have 80 microts to exit , after which , your Juxtowi crystal will be activated . Any attempt to leave and the crystal will bore through your brain . Do you think it 's worth going through with this ? Only if this guy can give us information about that critter that attacked my family and killed my friends . The creature you describe is neither Peacekeeper nor Scarran in origin . If it is from Tormented Space , Katoya will know about it . Then why won 't he just frelling tell us ... Shh . - ... about it ? We paid him . His price is completion of the course . Excuse me . Question . Before we commit to your class ... Are you afraid that you may not be able to handle the pain ? Look , I can put up with the fairy crystal and the jammies , but I need to know what else we get in gym membership . What the plitz is that smell ? Rygel : The stench of that frelling Charrid . No , I know that odor . D 'Argo : Macton . ( hissing ) D ! You killed my wife . This is not your fight . - Your sister ! You set me up and then you sent me to prison . Oh , you didn 't want the truth then . You 're not interested now . Get off him . Come on . I 'm not interested in your lies . Oh , let him hit me , like he hit Lo 'Laan . Beat his own wife to death . ( furious howl ) That ends this . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . You okay , bro ? Macton 's a liar . He 's a frelling liar . Rygel : He 's a frelling Peacekeeper . A frelling Peacekeeper found us . Let 's go , fast , before more arrive . I am afraid it will not be permitted to leave the compound prematurely . Oh , ridiculous . What does Katoya care ? He 's got our currency . Once you agree to stay , you must abide the rules . Crichton : I don 't give a damn about the rules , we 're not gonna stick around till a Marauder lands . This sector of Tormented Space is forbidden to Peacekeepers unless they have received express orders from First Command and therefore , it is highly likely that Macton is here unofficially ... alone . Unofficially , Grasshopper , how the hell did he find us ? I 'll be sure to ask him before I kill him . Katoya will not allow you or Macton to kill each other . To Hezmana with Katoya ! Macton deserves to die ! He destroyed my family . My wife . My son . Lo 'Laan : He loves me . You mustn 't do anything . D 'Argo 's done nothing to me . I 'm fine . D 'Argo 's fine . You refuse to see him for what he really is . He is a Luxan warrior . Yes . And he cannot help but hurt you . D 'Argo will never hurt me . And I won 't hurt him either . Good to see you , brother . No . We 're both here . One of us must die . I wouldn 't run even if I could . D , I got your back on this . Grasshopper may be telling the truth . Katoya won 't let us disrupt his class . You can deal with Macton when school is out . ( buzzer ) Katoya : Return to the arena . Recess is over . Now that calmer minds prevail , a demonstration . Join me . I 'm just here to watch . Everyone must participate . After the probes , land mines , corkscrews I 've had in my head , I ain 't offering up a chunk for your mind games . It is not a game . It ain 't gonna happen , Miss Krabappel . Fail me . Give me an " F " on my report card . But I ain 't going in your icosahedron . Yes , of course . Proves nothing to me for you to win , Grasshopper . Begin . Overcome the pain . Pain . See , that 's what I 'm talking about . Pain . Try again . Do not withhold your efforts . Nor is anger a substitute for clarity . The task may be completed with a minimum of physical harm . ( deep breathing ) Shall we end our demonstration ? ( straining ) : I was just starting to enjoy the pain . Crichton : Well , that was instructive . Kind of led with your chin there . It 's not meant to be painless . It never will be painless , John . Oh . What the hell are you doing here ? Responding to D 'Argo 's death threats . He said he was coming for me . Oh . See , I was just wondering why you followed me to the bathroom . I don 't want to kill D 'Argo . But I won 't allow him to kill me to conceal what he did . He killed his wife . No . You killed your sister . D 'Argo murdered Lo 'Laan in a fit of hyperrage . Do you know what Luxan hyperrage is ? Yes , I do . Do you know what a " crock " is ? D 'Argo says he didn 't do it . That 's good enough for me . You don 't understand . He may not know what he did . Right , eight cycles and change just , zoop , slips his mind . You do know that Luxan hyperrage causes blackouts ? Is that a fact ? Yes . And any honest Luxan can tell you that . Please . Rygel : The Charrid 's going next . I 'd love to take him on . I 'd show him some real pain . What did he say to you ? Nothing . Forget about it . I can 't ! Perhaps you could spend some of that energy in here . Rygel : Not him . Me . He chose me , Rygel . These Charrid frax killed billions of my people . This is not a safe place to settle grudges , Hynerian . It is not a game . - It 's a war of wills . Where else will I get a chance at a fair fight , where I have the advantage ? Proceed . At your own risk . D 'Argo : What lies did Macton tell you ? Ah , he just mentioned you were sending some threats . Yeah . It 's true . Katoya : Begin . D 'Argo : Come on , he must have told you more . Man , I don 't wanna talk about it . It 's just gonna piss you off , which is what he wants . D 'Argo : I 'm already pissed off . What 'd he say ? He mentioned something . About hyperrage causing blackouts . He said all Luxans get ' em . D 'Argo : I do not want Macton here ! I refuse to have him in this house ! You 're upsetting yourself over nothing . D 'Argo , can you hear me ? ( screaming ) - D 'Argo , can you hear me ? ( screaming ) D 'Argo ... Blackouts during hyperrage can ... do happen . But I learned to control all that . So , you got the problem licked . Young Luxans are genetically violent . Their impulses , chemistry , biology , it takes cycles to master . It 's why Luxans aren 't allowed to marry young . And you kids ignored all that . She said she knew I could never hurt her . Even more than that , I gave her my solemn vow if I did ever hurt her , I would leave immediately , no questions . Well , it must have worked . You guys stayed together . Lo 'Laan was always there for me . ( Rygel groaning ) Excuse me , Master Jedi . Looks like Sparky 's losing more than a few brain cells in there . He 's expending a lot of energy . Crichton : Is he in any real danger in there ? ( groaning ) All right , that 's the ball game . Get him out . It was his choice . Let 's get him out . D 'Argo : He 's like ice . Keep him covered . That 's a great job . Nice of you to step in before somebody got hurt . What he did was his choice . I hope what he learned will serve him well . I 'll tell you what we 've learned . We 've learned not to take classes from a head job . Now we 're outta here . - Your training isn 't over . Oh , yes it is . It 's just begun . Master . Crichton is fine . He 's been moved to remedial training . Yeah , I know . The Dominar is recovering as well . Yeah , I wasn 't thinking about that , either . I 'm aware of that . But perhaps you should heed their example and attempt to remain focused on your more immediate tasks first . ( growls ) Please . Stay focused . Lo 'Laan : D 'Argo . D 'Argo , can you hear me ? Did I hurt you ? No . I know this upsets you . It upsets you , too . We 'll get through it . If I did hurt you , you 'd tell me , wouldn 't you ? You promised . You never hurt me , D 'Argo . But you 'd tell me if I did . Absolutely . I promise . I would tell you . ( yells ) Katoya : Avoid pain , and find a way out . ( yells ) Try harder . Anger will not serve you . Find your path . ( yells ) ( yells ) Release your mind . ( yells ) Stop it now ! I 'll kill you ! ( yells ) To exert even a microt of self-control over your personal impulses is the point of the exercise . I 'm leaving . That won 't provide you with the answers you seek . What answers ? What questions ? Look , I 'm not playing any more of your stupid games , and I do not need to be reminded of my mental limitations ! If I stay here , I will kill Macton ! I ... will ... kill this man ! You see ? You can control your anger . You have no limitations . Ahh ! Ahh . Damn . Hey ! D 'Argo ! Can anybody hear me ? ! This must be detention then . Hey , it 's getting kind of ripe in here . Macton is lying . How do you know ? Because he 's a Peacekeeper . Because he has to be . Look , he 's trying to get to you , and it 's working . Lo 'Laan and I were happy together . He can 't change that . I won 't let him . He 's definitely getting to you . I should 've killed him . Isn 't that what you set out to do when we all left Moya ? Part of me knew it wouldn 't bring Lo 'Laan back . Another part couldn 't resist letting him know that I knew exactly where he was . Pay attention to the part that wants to kill him . He 's given you a second chance to take your revenge . I 'm not sure I want to . For yotz sake ! Kill him and be done with it . ( whistles " Colonel Bogey March " ) Are you real ? Are you ? Oh , riddles . Riddle me this , riddle me that . I have one . Why is it never just the heat . It 's the humidity ? While you 're pondering that , why don 't you let me the hell outta here . As you wish . One thing first . Here 's a key . You weren 't quick enough . Get a key and you may come out . ( whistles ) I 'll say this just once . Stay away from me . Stay away from my friends . And stop spreading your lies . I 'm not the one lying . - Oh , you 're full of dren . You 've always hated me . You 'd have hated any non-Sebacean who married your sister . I may have come to accept the marriage , until you started beating her . I 'm violent when I choose to be . And right now , I choose not to kill you . But that could change . Really ? Well , if I chose to kill you , you 'd never see me coming . No , I came to give you the truth . Dren . The truth your blackouts stopped you from seeing . That poor Lo 'Laan stopped you from seeing . You 're full of dren . Am I lying about your hyperrage ? Am I lying about your blackouts ? I say even a stupid Luxan should be able to see the truth . You 're full of lies ! D 'Argo , no . Look at you . Your uncontrollable rage . Your violence . You really think you 'd be able to protect Lo 'Laan from that ? No . You must have known the truth . You 've always known . ( clinking ) ( sizzling ) ( yelling with pain ) Son of a ... You 'd better have a key . Katoya informs me you 've been experiencing some setbacks . He tell you who sicced that critter on my family ? That is relatively unimportant . It 's important to me . Because it was unsuccessful . That 's okay , then . I don 't need to be in here . If Earth is safe , everything 's fine . No , Earth is not safe . And neither are you . The Scarrans know you exist . They are already coming for you , John . You cannot run away for your whole life , and I cannot protect you from them . Little Cat A , I don 't want you to protect me because Little Cat B , you haven 't been doing such a bang-up job of that in the first place , which brings us to Little Cat C , get me the hell out of this hole ! You are undergoing a very specific training . Anti-Scarran Training . Well , I figured that out already . It 's not the heat . It 's the humidity ! The heat mechanisms the Scarran employs is just the beginning , John . If that heat succeeds in disabling your mind 's defenses , there is no fact , no fear , no deep secret that they will be unable to extract . I 'll take my chances on my own , thank you . You misunderstand my objectives , John . Without Katoya 's training , when the Scarrans find you , they will take your wormhole knowledge and then they will kill you . I could never allow that . Oh , Scorpy-Sue . After all we 've meant to each other . You 'd kill me first . You ... have such a limited mental capacity , John . But apparently , an abundant will to prevail . Well , my advice to you is to use that will right here , right now ! Katoya is the only one that can give you the tools to resist the Scarrans . ( whistling " Colonel Bogey March " ) Katoya : Your Crichton may not survive the training . Scorpius : Oh , he will . He is like me in that respect . He 'll survive . For you to have survived so long , my teachings must have been helpful . They 've saved my life , on countless occasions . I attempted to teach you to overcome your need for a cooled suit . And yet , you still have use of one . One can always learn more . I request three favors . Do I owe so many ? I did spare you from both Peacekeeper captivity and my Aurora Chair . I would have survived your Aurora Chair . ( inhales deeply ) Proceed . Firstly , intensify Crichton 's training . Even if it kills him ? Without the training , he will die anyway . Secondly , Macton has become a distraction . Maybe a dangerous one . He has done nothing wrong . I believe despite his protests , he will kill D 'Argo . Or D 'Argo will kill him . I will have neither here . Still , some preemptive action could be called for . Third ? Information , about a species I have no knowledge of . This ... species ... has recently attacked Crichton . May I describe it for you ? ( coals sizzling ) ( clinking ) ( grunts , then yells ) John , you okay ? Hey man , help me ... Get this thing open . ( grate creaking ) ( grunting ) ( groans ) ( huffing ) That didn 't budge , did it ? It 's gonna need at least a Qualta or a Pulse Grenade . Here . I brought you something to drink . ( coals sizzling ) Thanks . - Listen , John , this is really doing my head in . I 've spent thinking about killing Macton for half my life . That 's a hell of a thing , man . Look , if you get me out of here , I 'll kill him for you , all right ? No , no , I can kill him . Frell knows I 've wanted to , but , uh ... what if Lo 'Laan lied ? She lied about the blackouts , then perhaps without knowing or remembering , I hit my wife . Don 't go there . That 's Macton talking . I am there , John . If that 's possible , then more ... - D 'Argo , many things are possible . Macton is just filling you with possibilities . What Lo 'Laan did ... and that 's what matters . Whatever she did , she did for you . That 's what 's important . And that means something . That means ... that it 's possible I killed the woman who loved me more than life . ( inhales deeply ) ( exhales ) Um ... . it probably won 't be apparent from my actions , but I really do have a great deal of respect for your work here . I 'm sure many warriors have been made great from your teachings . I just won 't be one of them . Do not sell yourself short . Mental strength is , uh ... well , it 's not my strength . I know that . That 's why I 've come to you . Your mind is troubled ? Whose isn 't ? Can you help me ... find an answer ? What would you like to know ? What kind of monster I really am . This need not be difficult . But it probably will be . Where do we start ? What would you like to see ? I , uh ... ( gasping ) I don 't wanna see that . Stay focused . I realize this is difficult . Lo 'Laan : I know this upsets you . ( gasps ) I know this upsets you , too . We 'll get through it . You 're upsetting yourself over nothing . ( hissing ) D 'Argo ? ( shallow breathing ) D 'Argo ! Can you hear me ? Katoya : Hyperrage is a natural function of Luxan physiology . But it 's a function to be controlled , not flaunted . Not to be used against someone you love . Can you hear me ? Did you use it against her ? I don 't know . But you want to know . Can you hear me ? ! No . - But you came here to know . Can you hear me ? No ! Oh ! ( panting ) I hit her . ( exhales sharply ) Did I hurt you ? No . But you 'd tell me ? Promise me you would , please . You never hurt me , D 'Argo . You promised you 'd tell me . Why didn 't you tell me ? Don 't you know how much I loved you ? Yes . ( crashing ) Sorry to interrupt , Master . Ka D 'Argo . Time to revisit your memories . What have you done with Katoya ? I refocused his energies . Hello , sister . ( hisses ) Welcome home . Scene of the crime . Scene of your many crimes . ( yelling ) Lo 'Laan : D 'Argo , no ! Macton : Just like before . That never happened . Lo 'Laan : Go ahead , hit her . ( Macton 's voice ) : Never a problem for you when she was alive . No , I never meant to . ( Lo 'Laan 's voice ) : Oh . Never meant to do this ? Or this . Or this . Hy-hyperrage . It was you . Because you couldn 't control yourself . Because you were weak ! Recognize the place ? Your cell . Not here . Not now . Not like this . Where else ? This is where you belong . You 're a wild beast . A mad dog . ( hisses ) You 've earned those chains . And worse . ( clinking ) ( gasps ) ( clinking ) ( screams ) How 's it feel to be helpless ? Defenseless ? This is what you did to Lo 'Laan . This is what your rage felt like . Rage that destroyed a beautiful girl . Come on . ( clinking ) Ha ! Gotcha ! ( screams ) ( grunting ) ( screaming ) I didn 't kill Lo 'Laan . No . No , you did much worse . Your violence drove her to her death . No . You beat her beyond her capacity to endure anymore . Oh , no . But I got there first . I doctored the scene . Provided the evidence that put you in prison . To rot forever . ( sobbing ) Don 't try to resist . It 's my gift to you , D 'Argo . Your own hyperrage in a place where you can rot in it forever . Just you and your hyperrage for eternity . ( yelling turns to screaming ) Focus . ( D 'Argo 's screaming continues ) Focus . No . You 're lying . Every word you 've said is a lie . No . You beat her and you killed her . You know the truth . You never knew Lo 'Laan and you knew nothing about love . I know what Lo 'Laan went through for our love . I wish I could have loved her half as well . Oh , you loved her to death . You do not have this power . Lo 'Laan told me that I do have power over my hyperrage . And it 's more than enough to control you in here . Oh , you cannot kill me . Not in here . I have no intention of killing you . I loved my wife . But you wouldn 't know that . You didn 't know Lo 'Laan . I did . She could have left me for my failings . Maybe she should have . But I know this . She would never have left her son without a mother . So ... I want you to show me your memories . And tell me why you killed Lo 'Laan . Trying to save her from you . D 'Argo will be dishonorably discharged . Jailed for as long as you need . But he 's done nothing wrong . He has done everything wrong . You 'll thank me for this , sister . No , I won 't let you ! ( gasps ) It was your fault . She attacked me . My reflexes took control . My Peacekeeper training . It was over before I realized . D 'Argo : It 's not the truth . Not the whole truth . She was beaten . It was your fault she died . You had to pay . I had to make you pay . I had to make it look like you 'd done it in a fit of hyperrage . Had to make sure you were blamed . You okay ? I 'm fine . You want me to drive ? - No , I 'm fine . Rygel : If you were fine , you 'd have killed Macton instead of leaving him there . He 's trapped in a coma with his own nightmares . Killing him would have been merciful . I 'm not that enlightened . So tell me , John . Were you able to obtain the key ? ( whistles " Colonel Bogey March " ) Incidentally , that creature that attacked you on Earth . It might interest you to know it is called a Skreeth . Apparently it can communicate telepathically over vast distances . Yeah , Katoya give you that ? If it did map Earth 's location , it may well have passed on that information . Who would it pass it on to ? Grayza , almost certainly . So the Peacekeepers know where Earth is . May know . Would Grayza go there ? Eventually , perhaps . Grayza does not want Earth . Grayza wants you . Why do I always attract the psychos ? Hey man , you sure you 're okay ? Yeah , I 'll be fine . I 've ... got things on my mind . Things I 've done . Things I can 't take back .

 [ Motor Whirring ] [ Shivering ] A whole lot of white . That 's what I 'm getting . I told you this was a stupid place to park . And I told you to dress appropriately . I got 42 T-shirts on . I can 't feel my legs . Stay focused . Ten more minutes , we 'll have what we need . [ Frohike On Headset ] Ice Station Zebra , do you read me ? Loud and clear . What do you see ? Nothing yet , but I 'm scoping major heat . Somebody 's coming . Oh , yeah . There 's our poacher . He should be on your grid now , skiing north , towards the border . He 's coming your way down the hill , Jimmy . - [ Shutter Clicks ] - I read you , Zebra . I 'm in position . This is Snowflake , by the way . [ Sighs ] I told you not to let him pick his own name . Got two men of Asian extraction whojust arrived by snowmobile . Those are the buyers . It 's up to you now , Jimmy ... Uh , Snowflake . [ Byers ] Make sure you get a shot of the merchandise changing hands . Here he comes . Whoa . What is he doing ? - Wh-What 's going on ? - He just skied off . He 's not heading to the meeting . Damn it , Jimmy . - Did you ... Did you let him see your face ? - No , he didn 't see me . It must be something else . I 'll find out what . Mr. Bond ? Are you with me ? Where am I ? You don 't recall having this conversation already ? You 're in St. Jude 's Hospital in Bellingham . - Washington , right ? - Exactly . You had a bad accident while you were skiing . I 'm your surgeon , Dr. Bromberg . I did the ligament work on your leg . It should heal up fine . You have quite a concussion . I wanna keep you here a couple more days , make sure you 're okay . - You up for a visit ? - Yeah . Hey , guys . Guess what . It seems that I have been in some sort of skiing accident . We know , Jimmy . We brought you here . You remember , don 't you ? Please tell me you remember . I , uh ... Yeah , I do ... sort of remember skiing ... now that I think about it . But what did you see out there ? I don 't know . What ? Oh , God ! I can 't do any more surveillance out there . I got thin blood . Jimmy , uh , see if this rings any bells for you . There 's a poacher up here ... a survivalist and ex-con by the name of Walter Stukas . Total antigovernment nut job . He did time for murder . He recycles his own urine . [ Byers ] And he traps and kills grizzly bears . Their whole species is threatened . Their numbers are diminishing . But this man kills these magnificent animals for their gallbladders . Worth ten times their weight in gold on the Asian black market . The Triad smuggles ' em through Western Canada to mainland China . If we can catch them in the act and get the evidence ... we can get one hell of a story ... and the cops , they could shut him down . Jimmy , please . Stopping this means a lot to me . You have to remember . So , you 're awake ! - How are you feeling ? - Really , really frustrated . If I can 't clear my head ... a whole lot of bears are gonna die . [ Clears Throat ] Well ... hang in there , buddy . Well , Jimmy ... my name is Marilyn ... and if there is anything that I can do to make you feel better ... you be sure to let me know . So , well , your girlfriend must have been terribly worried about you . Don 't have one . Oh . I have to give you an injection . It 's , uh , pain medication for your leg . [ Yawning ] Okay . - Mm-mmm . - Not in the arm ? Doctor 's orders . Oh , my . Huh ? - [ Needle Punctures Skin ] - Nothing . [ Moans ] Now , what else can I do for you ? Hmm ? Sponge bath , maybe ? What is it that you want ? Cotton balls . Lots and lots of cotton balls . [ Shivering ] How can anybody live up here ? Think warm thoughts ... like how good it 'll feel to see this man Stukas arrested . Well , hello , Mr. Stukas . [ Langly ] He can 't see us , can he ? [ Banging On Door ] [ Yelps ] Crap ! It 's cold ! Oh , man . What a nut . - That guy 's so paranoid , he makes us look normal . - What did you find out ? He 's completely off grid . Makes his own electricity . No phones . Whole lot of Spam . He 's coming out again . Is that what I think it is ? Oh , God . Somebody ought to shoot and skin him . Byers , man , I mean , the g-guy is scum , but come on . Why are you taking this so personally ? Are you okay , buddy ? I just want to put a stop to this . But if we have to sit here until he decides to sell more of his merchandise ... Let 's just hopeJimmy remembers something useful . Well , he 'd better be killing himself trying . [ Announcer ] America fights back . And now John Walsh . [ Walsh ] Tonight , I need your help capturing one of the slipperiest killers ... we 've ever come across . Richard Millikin is a doctor , an arthroscopic surgeon . But apparently he 's forgotten his Hippocratic oath ... the one that says do the patient no harm . Whoa . In one ten-month period at one of Denver 's busiest hospitals ... Dr. Millikin had four patients die on his operating table . Bad luck ? Hardly . Turns out he was poisoning them . Man , if you can 't trust your doctor , who can you trust ? In the fall of 1999 ... 56-year-old Melvin Greydough checked into Denver 's Holy Cross Hospital ... to undergo arthroscopic knee surgery . Little did he know he 'd never be checking out . But first , all the news headlines after this . ( music ) [ TV : Dramatic ] [ Walsh ] Why would a doctor poison his own patient ? Perhaps it offered Millikin a chance to be heroic in the operating room . - Or maybe ... - Maybe these surplus figures are way off . Hey , uh , I was watching America 's Most Wanted . [ TV : Man ] Running potential deficits as a result . - [ TV : Channel Changes ] - Mr. Dimsdale , we talked about this . Don 't be a TVhog . Why can 't I have a private room ? With all the money I 've shelled out , you could 've built an extra wing onto this dump ! The names you need to know , after this . - Senator Gramm says ... - Hey ! - The index ofleading economic indicators ... - Jimmy , I 'm sorry . - Who is that ? - Oh , that 's Mr. Dimsdale . I hate it when he 's on my floor . He 's been here before ? Yeah . Too many times . And he 's always like this . I never would have put him in your room if I had anywhere else to put him . So , I 'm sorry , but ... He 's in rather poor health . I don 't wanna get him riled up . Think you can try to ignore him , for me ? - Oh ! I got your supplies ! Everything you need ! - [ Chuckles ] Oh , man ! Excellent ! Nurse Marilyn , you 're the best . Thanks . But , uh , it 's just Marilyn . So , what are you gonna do with all this stuff ? I can 't remember what happened when I had my accident ... and I really need to . So I figure if I can reenact it , I might remember what I forgot . - Reenact ? - Yeah . Like on America 's Most Wanted . Except without the actors . Instead , I 'll build a model that represents ... the scene of the crime , so to speak . Wow , that 's ... that 's really interesting . - [ Call Signal Dinging ] - Um ... I have to go . But if you need anything ... uh , you just push my button . The button . Um , uh ... Button . [ TVContinues : Man Speaking ] [ Snoring ] Energy problem could get even worse ... - if natural gas suppliers refuse to ship ... - [ Channel Changes ] That 's where you come in . Unfortunately , this is the only photo we have of him . Keep in mind , he may have changed his appearance drastically in the past year . And here 's one odd detail ... Millikin is known for his sweet tooth . His pockets are usually filled with candy . [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Patient ] Dr. Bromberg . Dr. Bromberg ? I think I 'm starting to feel my knee . It kinda hurts . How about it , Greg ? - It shouldn 't be . - You 're mistaken , Mr. Keever . We 're almost done . Just relax . Perfection . You 'll be dancing . Close up for me , will ya . - [ Gasping ] - [ Monitor : Beeps Accelerating ] - [ Nurse ] Pressure 's dropping . - What the hell ? - He 's seizing . Call a code . - [ Gasping Continues ] [ Monitor : Sustained Tone ] [ Imitating Engine ] Good morning ! So , how did you sleep . Really good . This idea ... of going to the bathroom without getting out of bed ... I really think that it 's gonna catch on in the civilian world . Wow ! I love your little man . [ Chuckles ] It 's me . It 's not quite to scale to the mountain ... and I try to bend my knees more when I ski . Well , I think it 's wonderful . In fact , I think ... you deserve a nice ... warm sponge bath . Ah , don 't trouble yourself . [ Sighs ] Nobody checked on you last night ? - Uh-uh . - I 'm sorry . I know that they were dealing with a little situation . [ Dimsdale ] " A little situation . " Ha ! That 's a laugh ! Some schmuck dying on Bromberg 's operating table . That 's your " little situation . " - Mr. Dimsdale ! Please ! - Tell me something . Who dies during arthroscopic knee surgery ? Arthroscopic knee surgery ? Dr. Bromberg is an arthroscopic surgeon ? He worked on you , didn 't he ? What did you think he was , a vet ? You know something ? I have a hunch ... that there is a big ice cream bar in the residents ' lounge ... with your name on it . [ Laughs ] I will be right back . Yves ! I heard you were laid up . How are you feeling ? I busted my leg up pretty good . But the doctor says it 'll heal fine . Wait a minute . You came all the way out to Washington state ... just to check on me ? - I was concerned about you . - No offense , but since when ? I always get the feeling that you think I 'm kind of an idiot . - Gee , lady , you too ? - [ Sighs ] That 's Mr. Dimsdale . We 're supposed to ignore him . Jimmy , I 'm perplexed . Why do you think I don 't like you ? Wow . [ Chuckles ] Okay . I tell ya ... I-I usually have a great sense for when women dig me . Oww ! - [ Groaning , Whimpering ] - I 'm sorry . [ Door Closes ] I had no idea you were so creative . What does this represent ? Well , basically ... it 's to help me remember what happened on the day of my accident . You don 't remember ? I get flashes here and there . Like , I remember ... I had Pop-Tarts in the morning ... but I can 't remember what kind . Jimmy , all the best . Have a swift recovery . Don 't I get a kiss ? Time for your injection . Wait . Don 't I get ice cream ? - [ Needle Punctures Skin ] - Oww ! [ Groaning , Panting ] [ Snoring ] - Guys , wake up . - Huh ? - Frohike . Frohike . - Hmm ? What ? Whoa . Why does he have a rifle ? Uh , he can 't know we 're here , right ? - [ Gunshot ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Gunshots Continue ] - [ Groaning , Shouting ] Get off of me ! Idiots ! [ Gunshots Continue ] He wasn 't shooting at us . Wow . Don 't I feel lucky . [ Sneezes ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Frohike ] What do you figure ? Does Mr. " I Hate Civilization " have a pen pal ? Certainly love to find out . [ Jimmy ] Fifty-six hours ago ... I was midway down the slope , right about here ... - [ Dimsdale ] Shut up over there ! - [ Click ] - [ Click ] - Frohike was positioned ... upslope , near the tree line ... which puts the rising sun ... [ Dimsdale ] People are suffering here ! We need some peace and quiet ! Is that too much to ask ? Can 't you get that through your little ganglion , you shaved ape ? [ Click ] You know what ? That 's it . I don 't care how old you are . You need to learn some manners ! Come and get me ! Come on ! Yeah , you 're all talk . Come on ! Where are ya ? Where are ya , tough guy ? I 'm not afraid of the likes of you ! I may be old , but I can still whip your butt ! [ Grunting , Yelling ] And there 's more where that came from ! What the hell is going on here ? Hey , I 'm not a doctor , but the boy needs more meds . He 's rambunctious ! - That man 's a lunatic ! - I 'm not gonna feel safe unless he 's tied down ! Be quiet , both of you ! Please . I can 't hear myself think . [ Groaning Continues ] Doctor ? - You dropped this . - Keep it . So , you have a sweet tooth ? I suppose . I 'm sorry your patient died last night . [ Langly Shivering ] [ Byers ] " Shiny Health Medical Group . " - [ Continues Shivering ] From Sh-Sh ... - Shanghai , China . And I bet their motto is , " A grizzly gallbladder a day keeps the doctor away . " Those are our buyers , all right . What would they be sending by overnight letter to our poacher ? The location of their next meeting ? That 's what I 'm guessing , which is why we 've got to steal a look . - [ Sneezes ] - [ Phone Rings ] - Yeah ? - It 's me . - [ Jimmy ] I 'm onto something big . - You remember what happened ? No . How could I ? I broke my diorama . Listen , guys , my doctor ... is a killer . He was on America 's Most Wanted . He 's got a different name and hair and all ... but I think it 's really him . What proof do you have ? I got this . [ Byers ] You 're on the phone , Jimmy . Uh ... Um , i-it 's a sucker . - [ Sighs ] - The guy eats suckers . [ Scoffs ] - [ Click , Dial Tone ] - Guys ? I ... I think we have a bad connection . Guys ? [ Grunting ] [ Gasps ] [ Muttering ] Bromberg . Bromberg . Old Mr. Dimsdale . He 's next . Please , just fill out the form , Mr. Dimsdale . You 're holding up my entire staff . Nazi Germany ! This is how it starts ! Don 't forget the next of kin . It 's just in case of emergency . In case of emergency ? What the hell is he for ? I don 't have any kin , next of or otherwise . [ Scribbling Signature ] - Satisfied ? - Very well . I 'll see you in a few hours , Mr. Dimsdale , in the O.R. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Mr. Dimsdale , you can 't go through with this operation . Why not ? Because I have reason to suspect ... that that man is a murderer . There was a story on America 's Most Wanted . A doctor named Millikin from Denver ... he poisoned four ofhis patients ... and then disappeared . I think that Bromberg ... may , in fact , be ... this Dr. Millikin . Just how hard did you fall out of bed ? Listen , they said that this Millikin has a sweet tooth . See ? And that he 'd probably change his appearance . So I snuck in and checked out his records . He 's been herejust under a year . That fits perfect with when Millikin disappeared from Denver . Okay , Dick Tracy , there 's the phone . Call the cops . Uh ... I still don 't have any proof . [ Exhales ] [ Byers ] We have to get in there . We have to read that letter he received . That 's our only hope . G-G-Good luck . The g-g-guy doesn 't wander 20 feet from the place . Maybe we should just pack it in for a while . [ Sighs ] Go , if you have to . I 'm staying till I got him dead to rights . Byers , we wanna get the guy too . But what is with you and this story ? Why are you taking it so personally ? Do you remember Gentle Ben ? The TV show ? I loved it as a kid . Gentle Ben had this huge , furry neck . I-I couldn 't even have gotten my arms around it ... but I wished so badly I could hug him . I wished I could have him as my pet . Then , when I was 12 years old , my family and I went camping ... and we saw a grizzly for real . - Cool . - No . I was petrified . He was a rogue male . We watched him overturn a Dumpster the size of a car . A not-so-gentle Ben . He wouldn 't leave , so the park rangers had to shoot him . And afterwards ... I remember looking at him lying there ... and I realized ... once he was gone , there 'd be no more like him . Hey , I think I know something that 'd get thatjoker out ofhis cabin . Someone wants to murder him . Frankly , I have no trouble believing that . But as for the rest of it ... killer surgeons and so forth ... Yves , there 's not a lot of time . - What do you want me to do ? - Computers . Hack into the memory banks of the , you know ... Do the thing with the Internet . Look up , uh , the file with the ... on the computer ... so that we can bust the guy . You know , I can 't even set the clock on my VCR ... yet I 'm fairly certain what you just said is a whole bunch of crap ! Why are you with him ? I 'm not with him . Well , leave me out of your dementia . I want my new hip ! - [ Growls ] - [ Marilyn ] Mr. Dimsdale . You have a visitor . - Your son . - [ Sighs ] Just so you know , I 'm changing next ofkin on your form . - Well , are you gonna invite me in ? - No . Go away . - Come on , Pop . - Go away ! This is the man you want to help ? [ Loud Growl ] [ Growling Continues ] [ Growling Continues ] [ Grunts ] Gallbladder . Oh , you know you want it . Byers , what 's happening now ? It 's working , Langly . Get out of there . See ya later , sucker . Frohike , you 're up . [ Shouts , Groaning ] Oh , crap ! [ Byers On Headset ] Frohike . Progress ? [ Whispers ] I 'm in . Frohike , any luck ? It 's here somewhere . It 's gotta be . [ Sniffs ] I take it back . It 's not here . Keep looking . It has to be . I 'm telling you , I 've turned this place upside-down . Whoa ! [ Groans ] Frohike ? Frohike ! Langly ! Frohike . Frohike , get out of there ! I got a little bit of a situation here , Byers . Yes , you do . He 's coming back . [ Grunting ] [ Creaking ] [ Groans ] [ Dr. Bromberg ] Here we go . Mr. Dimsdale , please reconsider what we talked about . [ Sighs ] [ Door Closes ] Richard Millikin ! Ah ! That 's his real name . Not Bromberg , but Dr. Richard Millikin ... the Denver Doctor of Death ... [ Bystanders Murmuring ] in disguise and murdering anew . - [ Bystanders Gasping ] - Mr. Bond ! Huh ? Huh ? Huh ? And he 's only been here a year . Before that ... [ Gasps ] I couldn 't find any record of him . And he likes suckers ! And here 's the woman with the proof . Go ahead . Show ' em the proof . You mean , you don 't have any proof ? I have alopecia . I lost all the hair on my body . Last year , I was doing volunteer surgical work in Africa . And , yes , I do like suckers . I 'm gonna ... just ... Oww ! [ Groaning ] Oh ! Greg , I hope you didn 't have any dinner plans . [ Groaning Continues ] [ Byers ] This is the place , huh ? The address Stukas received by overnight mail ? [ Frohike ] I guess when you 're selling gallbladders , it 's better than the airport Hilton . Big , wide-open space . Probably do their deal right in this area . We need to find the perfect vantage point ... to catch it all on film . Bingo . - You sure you read that letter right ? - Positive . The deal goes down here at 6 : 00 tonight . - That gives us two hours before they show up . - Let 's get to work . - I 'm sorry , Yves . I feel so stupid . - Forget it . I have to be somewhere . Are you going to be all right ? Yeah . Sure . So , you 're not staying ? I have an appointment . I 'm late already . Well , if he were my boyfriend I wouldn 't leave . He 's not my ... Boy , did you make an ass of yourself . I really don 't want to talk about it . Seriously , what got into you ? - Why do you care ? - Why wouldn 't I care ? You 're another human being . Oh , sure , you 're a complete jerk ... but anybody can see what 's wrong with you . You 're scared . You 're crazy . No , I got you pegged . All that griping to the doctors and nurses . You just want somebody to pay attention to you . You 're scared of being alone . And what 's sad is that 's what you worry about , and you 've got a son . Let me tell you about my son . You know what he does for a living ? He 's a stockbroker , a Wall Street tycoon . Wow . Congratulations . He 's what 's wrong with this country ! He 's a greedmonger sticking it to the little guy . What kind of self-respecting union man ... would even want to talk to a guy like that ? One who doesn 't want to die alone . [ TV : Reporter ] After the story was featured ... on the television program America 's Most Wanted , police received several tips . One of them has led authorities to reexamine this bizarre murder case . A mortuary worker who saw the show ... recognized Dr. Millikin as a John Doe who was interred last spring . Police now believe the missing surgeon was not the Doctor of Death . He was poisoned by the real killer using a common anesthetic , lidocaine . Police are now widening their search for this killer . [ Whispering ] Same plan as before . We get the evidence , then we get the police . [ Whispering ] Here they come . This isn 't gonna work . I gotta get their faces . Hey ! Byers ! I 've gotta get the shot . Byers ! [ Man Speaking Chinese ] [ Click ] [ Man Shouting In Chinese ] Who the hell are you ? I 'm an investigative reporter ... here to put you out of business . I suppose there 's no point in telling you that what you do ... is obscene , immoral . Just know you won 't be doing it much longer . You 're right . I 'm running out of grizzlies . Who else is here ? You alone ? No . The police are outside . This whole building is wired for sound , and we 're being recorded . [ Men Murmuring In Chinese ] He 's alone . Say hello to the bears for me . [ Beeping ] Langly , someone else is here . [ Officer ] Freeze ! Drop your weapons ! - Now ! Now ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hey ! [ Chinese ] Hi . I 'm Greg Belluci . How are you doing ? Anesthetic kicking in ? - [ Laughing ] - Feeling better than earlier , I hope . That was quite a story you told . But how are you now ? Nice and dreamy ? All 's right with the world ? Sucker . [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Monitor : Sustained Tone Fades ] Skiing . I 'm skiing along . I ... I skied into a tree . It was you . You were there . Hey , guys ! I remember now ! The third skier was Yves . She was the one that met up with the poacher . We know already , Jimmy . Thanks . She tipped off the R.C.M.P. Turns out she had her own little sting goin ' . One she could have told us about right from the start . I nearly died of frostbite . What is it with you ? Why don 't you share ? Let 's not forget she saved Jimmy 's life . You did ? You were right about the Denver Doctor of Death . You were just mistaken about which doctor it was . This Belluci guy came here from Denver two months ago . That 's been his M.O. all along . Frame another doctor for the murders he commits , then kill that doctor . Make him disappear once the heat is on . - Where is he now ? - [ Byers ] In custody . Facing murder charges in two states . You saved my life . You like me . You really , really like me . [ Dimsdale ] Go figure . - [ Knock On Door ] - Pop , you ready ? Take care of yourself , you ... you big dope . [ Child ] I made this !

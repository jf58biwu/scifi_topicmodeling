 Captain 's Log , Stardate 53896 . B 'Elanna Torres has requested permission to take the Delta Flyer and search for dilithium . Shining Voyager , far from home , far from the gleaming cities of Earth . Headstrong B 'Elanna Torres and young Harry Kim speed away from Voyager on the Delta Flyer in search of their treasures . I 've trimmed the sails , but the sea is rough . Maybe we should return . I know what I 'm doing . A wave as high as a mountain struck the Delta Flyer . Get into the escape pod . We die together . No one is going to die . Go . Young Harry Kim left her side and B 'Elanna Torres was thrown against the rocks the rocks of our very shore . Which is where l , Kelis the Poet , found her ... broken ... dying . She told me her story and now I 've told you . An excellent conceit , that you discovered her yourself . Thank you . Well , now that B 'Elanna Torres has come to our shore , what will happen ? Does Captain Janeway come searching for her , or does she give her up for lost ? Who can say ? Well , I would hope that you can . I want to see more of these Voyager Eternals . Inspiration ... can 't be forced . One week . Or three weeks . Uh , maybe two . One week . The story will continue . Have you noticed how thin my performers have gotten ? Let them eat this . Ladies and gentlemen - - our patron salutes you . Finally ! We 're doing another Voyager play ... as soon as I can write it . Shall we celebrate , the two of us ? I have very little time . Celebrating will have to wait . Who are you ? ! Kelis ... Kelis , the Poet . Your servant . My servant . All right . Then let me go . I ... can 't . Why not ? You 'll fly from me ... the way inspiration always does . You 're trying to kill me . I 'm releasing the heat from your veins . What are you talking about ? You 've been in a fever since I found you . Bleeding is the best way to treat it . Oh , I can see I 'm in good hands . Something tells me you have your doubts . There 's a medkit over there . A box . Made out of metal ? There 's a small cylinder inside . Bring it here . Give it to me . Don 't be afraid . It won 't hurt you . Here . Pass it over where you cut me . You 're an Eternal . I suppose such things are to be expected . What other things do you expect from an Eternal ? The power to make the ground open up and the sky to fall . All the strange events sung by the ancient poets . Fortunately for me , no poet has ever sung about your clan . I 'm the first . My clan ? The Eternals on Voyager . " Shining Voyager , far from home . " How do you know about that ? Delta Flyer Log , Stardate 53918 . Harry and I are continuing toward the fourth planet . Sensors have picked up natural dilithium deposits on nearly every land mass . Acknowledged . Has your warp core been damaged ? Yes . We 're running on thrusters . Can you track our position ? How long have I been here ? Eight days . I was walking through these mountains . I saw a light burn across the sky , and I heard a terrible sound . When I arrived , I found you . I treated your wounds . And you tied me to this chair . When a gift falls from the heavens , only a fool would let her go . You 've already given me one play . The story told by those voices . I pieced them together , tried to fill in the gaps . You made a play out of our logs ? The Away Mission of B 'Elanna Torres . My patron was impressed . Well , he has great taste . Now , take that knife of yours and cut me free . That ... would be unwise . Why ? My patron is intrigued by the Voyager Eternals . He wants another play . To compose that , I need more ... details . And you expect to get them from me ? I did save your life . I need to get back to Voyager . I need another play . What exactly do you want to know ? Everything . It 's not possible . We " Eternals " have our rules . We can 't just ... give everything away . How did you get lost ? Cut me free and I 'll tell you . You won 't leave me ? Cut me free . You 're the one who 's leaving . Don 't come back . Computer , bring the subspace transmitter on line . Unable to comply . Why not ? lnsufficient power . Great . Now there 's no power . Are you hungry ? I told you not to come back . You haven 't eaten in days . We have to support each other , we poets . I 'm an Engineer . I fix things . From the looks of it , you 're not doing so well . Are you a poet or a critic ? Tell me about Earth . I have to sing for my supper , huh ? We all do in one way or another . Earth . It 's , uh ... an island ... a beautiful island , blue and green . And Voyager ? A - a great ship ? In a long line of great ships . How did Voyager get lost ? The Caretaker . An Eternal . Yes , you could say that . He ... caused a storm , which blew us off course . Tom Paris . Are you in love with him ? Supper is over . Come with me . This is where we put all the names and dates when our heads won 't hold anymore . A memory . Exactly . Tell me ... have you ever seen this before ? Winter 's tears . Can you get me some ? This is ... dilithium , isn 't it ? What you were looking for . Where can I find it ? The only deposit I know of is on the hunting grounds of my patron . He 'd execute me for trespassing , and you , well , he 'd love to capture an Eternal . M - maybe I 'm more powerful than he is . Perhaps , but , if he caught you , he 'd force you to fight against his enemies . They 're constantly at each other 's throats , bickering over territory , raiding each other 's land , starting wars whenever they can be guaranteed of good weather and we suffer the consequences . You don 't want to get involved with them . Which is why you 're going to get the dilithium . I told you , I 'd be executed if I 'm caught . The dilithium ... or I don 't say another word about ... " shining Voyager , far from home . " Did you ... ? Don 't get caught . Well ? Beautiful . I 've got an idea for your next play . I 've been visited by inspiration herself . How does this sound ? The Rescue of B 'Elanna Torres - - right here , in one week . One week ? ! Let 's get to work . Dismissed . That 's it ? Mr. Paris , try to stay calm . No , that 's not going to happen . Isn 't there anything else we can do ? Not until something shows up on sensors . I 'll take a shuttle out myself . I 'll run a planet - by - planet search . An inefficient plan . And too dangerous . You could be hit by the same spatial eddies that sent the Flyer off course . We need to concentrate our efforts from here , Tom . All right ? Dismissed . Steady - armed Paris , bound by a sleep that brings no rest ... The door opens and the shadow of a woman falls on the helmsman . His eyes open ... Seven of Nine , did you find B 'Elanna Torres ? I 'm sorry to disappoint you . Closer . Closer . Unpleasant news , delivered by the most pleasing of messengers . No , no , no , no . Seven of Nine is a Borg , - the scourge of the Eternals . - l ... You 're portraying her like a shy bride on her wedding night . Once more . Seven of Nine , did you find B 'Elanna Torres ? I am sorry to disappoint you . I can 't blame my performers . These Eternals on Voyager are difficult to understand . Will you stop walking around ? You 're going to break something . This Tuvok , for example . He 's not like anybody I 've ever met . No emotions ? How 's that possible ? It just is . It worked ? It worked . Okay . Computer , bring subspace transmitter on line . What happened ? ! I don 't know . The transmitter must have been weakened in the crash . It couldn 't take the energy surge . These Vulcans ... Enough ! What kind of metallurgic technology do you people have ? Alloys ... which ones can you make ? Steel ? Bronze ? Bronze . Bronze , all right . I need a plate of metal this big , as thin as it can be - - three parts tin to five parts bronze , one side coated with gold . Gold is expensive ; I can 't afford it . Then you 're going into debt . Then tell me about the Vulcans . Get me the plate , and then I 'll tell you . Everyone 's asleep . I 'll do it in the morning . The Vulcans ? Maybe I 've miscounted , but ... I don 't think you 've slept in ten days ? Your count is accurate . Don 't you think you should go to bed ? As a Vulcan , I can function without sleep for more than two weeks . But there 's a point of diminishing returns when your mind starts to play tricks on you . My mind , Mr. Neelix , does not play tricks . The ship is lonely without them , isn 't it ? If you would allow me to continue my sensor analysis , I might be able to locate them . If there 's anything else you need ... a stronger tea , perhaps . When a friend is lost , the mind is split in half , divided between memory of the past and fear of the future . Harry Kim , Ensign . Only a boy when fate took you from the arms of blue - green Earth . B 'Elanna Torres , half - Klingon , half - human . I am honored to call you ... What are you doing ? is that a tear ? Yes . Logical Tuvok doesn 't cry . That 's why they call him logical . Everybody cries . The land of Vulcan has no laughter , and it has no tears . It is a very quiet place - - calm , just like Tuvok . I can 't believe that . You don 't have to ; just don 't cry . The audience won 't believe it either . They 'll either think Tuvok is an unfeeling monster or that I am a bad performer . They 'll realize that beneath your unfeeling exterior is a heart that 's breaking , silently and in more pain than any of us can possibly understand , because that 's what it is to be Vulcan . Try it again . Kelis ! What 's wrong ? Our patron has been insulted by his enemy to the north . The armories are opened . Has a battlefield been chosen ? Not yet . Then we have a chance . I need your help . I 've given you enough help . Where 's that piece of metal ? Not bad . My patron 's been angered by the leader of a neighboring state . He 'll want to take revenge . It could lead to war . We Eternals aren 't supposed to take sides . I 'm not asking you to fight . I need a way to change his mind . I don 't have that kind of magical power . Yes , you do . I believe the right kind of play can turn the mind from violent thoughts . The perfect play might even stop a war . I can 't fix the transmitter with this . It has too many impurities . It 'll never carry a plasma charge . If the fighting starts , scouting parties will start moving through these mountains . You 'll be discovered . But my play ... it could stop it from happening . You have to help me . There 's nothing I can do . Then come with me . I 'll show you what I 've done so far . It 's our only chance . She 's a fellow poet from across the eastern sea , an expert on the Voyager Eternals . She 's devoted her life to them . She 's here to help . The Rescue of B 'Elanna Torres . We begin with Harry Kim , reaching Voyager in the escape pod . He tells Captain Janeway that B 'Elanna Torres is lost . We continue to the point where they discover a piece of the Delta Flyer . After that ... lt 's simple . They search for B 'Elanna Torres . B 'Elanna Torres is found ... - Or not found . - Or not found . The end . Sounds pretty straightforward to me . That 's exactly the problem . Where is the mistaken identity ? The discovery ? The sudden reversal ? Mistaken identity - - a character who is someone else . Discovery - - the moment when that identity is revealed . Reversal - - a situation that turns from good to bad in a blink of an eye . Find the truth of your story , and you won 't need all those tricks . I don 't know how things are done across the Eastern Sea , but here , poets have become lazy . They rely on manipulation to move their audience . It wasn 't always that way . Welcome . Thank you . The truth of my story . It 's an old - fashioned idea . Today audiences want excitement ... passion . Let me show you what I 've done with Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay . Let 's make a good impression on our visitor . Chakotay , why must I be denied what every other female officer on this ship can have ? Captain ? The privilege ... of your touch . Come in . If that was good news , you 'd be smiling . I was just contacted by an alien transport vessel . They picked up the Delta Flyer 's distress call . The primary controls are off - line . I 've ordered Harry to eject . I still have thrusters . I 'm setting a course for an L - Class planet . I 'll try to maintain contact . They couldn 't get a fix on her position . That was ten days ago . B 'Elanna ordered Harry into an escape pod . What 's the longest he could survive ? Less than ten days . An L - Class planet . I 've already narrowed the search parameters . If B 'Elanna made it there , it 's possible Harry did , too . Good night , Commander . Captain . We 'll have a final rehearsal in the morning . The last Tuvok scene doesn 't make sense to me , and we still don 't have an ending . I 've got the rest of the night to work on it . Maybe you can get some sleep . What did you think ? Captain Janeway kissing Commander Chakotay ? Tom Paris kissing Seven of Nine ? I don 't see the point . Anger is like fire . Love can be the rain that extinguishes it . My patron is filled with hatred for his rival . So our play should be filled with love . You can 't change somebody 's way of life with a few lines of dialogue . Yes , you can . It 's been done before . Do you know what this place used to be ... a hundred years ago ? A temple . And this was the altar stone . Every year a victim would be sacrificed on it in honor of winter , and then one year - - nobody remembers exactly when or why - - a play took the place of the ritual , and no one had to die here again . Why can 't my play take the place of a war ? Well , you 're going to have to do a lot better than Harry Kim kissing the Delaney sisters . Why ? Because ... when you think that you are surrounded by enemies , when you 're up against the Borg , or ... or Species 8472 , the last thing on your mind is romance . You 're an Eternal . You have to help me . I 'm sorry , Kelis . The Borg ... tell me more about them . They are soldiers , part of a vast army . They all think the same thoughts and they travel on ships that look like hives . Like insect colonies . They even have a queen . That sounds terrifying . Captain Janeway hasn 't been able to destroy them . She is a Starfleet officer , trained to avoid violence whenever possible . She would make peace with the Borg , if she could . This is what I need ... an enemy , someone to stand in the way of Voyager finding B 'Elanna Torres. lt ... Captain Janeway , driven by vengeance must seek out the Queen of the Borg . The audience thinks she plans to destroy them all , but ... Go on . The sudden reversal ! Eh , Captain Janeway , holding her spear at the queen 's throat , throws her weapon aside , and she argues passionately to put an end to their conflict ... in words no one will fail to understand . including your patron ? That 's much better than all that kissing . Stay and help me . I still need an ending . You 'll figure something out . B 'Elanna Torres dies tragically . You wouldn 't dare . I followed you here expecting to find a love nest . It 's quite a nest . You 're no poet from across the sea . You 're an Eternal . Maybe even B 'Elanna Torres herself . Don 't be ridiculous . Mm . You know all he thinks about is you ? We 're collaborators , that 's all . If you come to the performance tomorrow night , I 'll expose you to the Autarch . Just leave us alone . You fix your ship and go . Please . Friend of yours ? Harry ? Give me a hand . Here . Oh , how ? I ran into some turbulence in the escape pod , decided to turn around and follow your ion trail , landed about 200 kilometers from here . You walked ? At night . I tracked your position with a tricorder and tried to stay hidden during the day . Uh , I 've got some emergency rations left , a phaser , and the escape pod 's transmitter , which I didn 't have enough power left to run , but ... Harry Kim saves the day . Just the ending I was looking for . Huh ? The final moment . The last scene . More important than anything that 's gone before . But what is it ? Where is she ? Your collaborator 's probably halfway across the Eastern Sea by now . She 'll be here . You said we 'd have an ending by mid - morning . We won 't have time to learn it . It 'll come to me . Don 't worry . Want to give it a try ? Why not ? The 38th time might be the charm . It 's working ! The subspace transmitter is on line . Why don 't you do the honors ? Voyager ... this is the Delta Flyer . Our patron has arrived . He 's not in a very good mood . He will be . Not if this is any indication . Yes . Kelis , this is no way to end a play . It doesn 't make sense . It 'll have to . Go , go . Who are the enemies of Voyager ? The Borg ... Species 8472 ... You know where the ridge ends just below the peak ? Run there as fast as you can . You 'll find a vessel wrecked against the rocks . Go inside and give this to our friend . Don 't be frightened . Go . Tuvok . Tuvok . As you were . Bridge to Chakotay . Go ahead . Request permission to be relieved . Understood . I 'll be right there . We 're picking up a subspace transmission - - Starfleet frequency . It 's a little rough . Hang on . ... Delta Flyer . Harry and I are all right . We 're on an L - Class planet . Propulsion is down ... Origin ? 5.2 light - years . F - type star . Looks like the fourth planet . Lay in a course ... maximum warp . Seven of Nine . Captain . The Delta Flyer has been found ... in pieces on a rocky shore . And B 'Elanna Torres ? No sign of her . Seven of Nine , you are my eyes and my ears . If anyone can find her , it is you . Her eyes and her ears ... and the viper in her nest . I , Seven of Nine , have no intention of finding B 'Elanna Torres . I , Seven of Nine , am Queen of the Borg . Surprised ? No one will be more surprised than Janeway when I take my revenge on Voyager . Say nothing or you , too , will be assimilated . Captain ... I will comply . My enemies are everywhere ... without and within . Seven of Nine is Queen of the Borg . Surprised ? So was I . Tell her nothing , or I will lose my advantage ... and my ship as well . Are you okay ? Yes . We 're fine . Good to hear it . We 'll see you soon . Don 't be afraid . What is it ? " Without inspiration ... B 'Elanna Torres will perish . " He 's threatening to kill off B 'Elanna . As the climax to his play . Let him . That means ... that he still can 't figure out the ending . Uh , who cares ? ! I do . You 're serious . Harry have you ever inspired anybody ? That 's kind of a strange question . Well , it 's been a strange couple of weeks . He needs me , or he 's the one who 's going to die on that stage . What are you talking about ? The transporter is on line . Tell the Captain I 'll be a little late . B 'Elanna ... ? Wait for my signal . My death is irrelevant . You will never see the gleaming cities of Earth . You will be assimilated . And if I let you live ? Also irrelevant . You don 't believe that . The battle is over . Go home . How foolish of you to let me go ... free to attack you again . And again and again , until all your drones and all my crew are destroyed - - until everything we value is gone and there is nothing left ... but our hatred . This final scene will ruin everything that we 've done out there . We 'll have to improvise . It 's too late . No , it 's not . I knew you 'd come . And I told you not to . Wait ! Let 's go . Finally , Voyager has reached our shores . And not a moment too soon . Kelis the Poet must say good - bye as B 'Elanna Torres returns to the Eternals in a dazzling blaze of light . On a faraway , snow - covered peak ... No ! Right here , before your eyes . Wait . She 's not from across the Eastern Sea . She 's an Eternal . I 'm telling you she 's B 'Elanna Torres . The real B 'Elanna Torres ! I saw her ship ! The lead actress , in a fit of jealousy brands her rival an Eternal . Our patron rises to his feet to stop the play . Nicely done . I almost believed you . Continue . Stay . Voyager needs me . So do I . No , you don 't . You have all that you need right here . I 'll be inspired every time I think of you . One to beam to ascend ... to the heavens . And so ends The Rescue of B 'Elanna Torres , half - Klingon , B 'Elanna Torres , half - human , B 'Elanna Torres , Chief Engineer . These stories will continue ... for as long as we have the breath to tell them and as long as our patrons ... remain wise and compassionate . And Voyager will continue on her journey to the gleaming cities of Earth ... where peace reigns ... and hatred has no home .

 That 's Lobstertainment So I says , " Super Collider ? I just met her . " And then they built the Super Collider . Thank you . You 've been great . [ clapping ] Humorbot 5.0 , ladies and gentlemen . Our next standup 's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools . Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg ! FRY : All right ! - Yeah ! - All right ! Earth . What a planet . On Earth , you enjoy eating a tasty clam . On my planet , clams enjoy eating a tasty you ! Maybe I 'm not loud enough . On Earth , everybody is looking for a squid ! On my planet- - Reload . So these three parasitic worms bore into a human 's head . [ groaning ] And they walk up to the bar and then- - Uh-oh . Wait ! Stop ! I 've got more ! Aw . My whole life I worked on that act . - And they hated it . - You 're a crazy lobster doctor ! - You shouldn 't be a comedian ! - But comedy is in my valves . My Uncle Harold was a big star back in the era of silent holograms . - Your uncle was Harold Zoid ? - This I cannot deny . Why , I 've been a fan since back when my hips were made of bone ! As it happens , I still have some of my original 78s . He 's a lot funnier than you could ever be . Maybe , but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers ... . This letter has to be very personal , so I 'm writing it in my own ink . [ SQUELCHlNG ] ZOlDBERG : " Dear Uncle Zoid , Greetings from your nephew . Norm and Sam and Sadie 's boy ? Remember ? Now I 'm the most important doctor at the company where I work . But my life is bereft of laughter . " " l beg of you , Mr. Funny Uncle . Teach me the comedy business . Sincerely , Zoidberg . " Isn 't that nice ? - What 's that scribble-di-gook ? - lt 's a letter from my rich nephew ... ... who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse , he might . [ GROANS ] Yeah , you 'd better run ! [ SQUELCHlNG ] " Dear Rich Doctor Nephew , I can help you be funny . The first funny thing you must do ... ... is put your money in check form and come to Hollywood . " " Sincerely , Harold Zoid . P.S. : cashier 's check . " Did you hear that ? I 'm going to Hollywood ! WOMAN : Welcome to Hollywood ! I must warn you ... ... there 's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour . I 'm kidding . That never happens . Now , to your right , you 'll see 30th Century Fox Studios . Fox uses searchlights to blind pilots ... ... then film the resulting plane crashes . - Neat ! - Ahead ... ... you 'll see the home of Mel Gibson , star of the hit film Bravehead . Do we have any fans of Calculon ... ... star of the robot soap All My Circuits ? I am ! Me ! Bender is ! Then you 'll want to get a close look at his Bel Air home . Yes , I will . - Are you my hot-water heater ? - No . - We met once . Remember ? - Absolutely not . Remember I was bugging you a lot ? - You remember , right ? - Look , I 'm programmed to be very busy . Unless you can heat water to 21 2 degrees , I 'm not interested . Have you got an extra GOTO 1 0 line ? I don 't need a Bender . That was the other guy . My name 's Boiler . - Nice work , Boiler . - Thanks . And call me Bender . That 's where l 'm meeting Uncle Zoid to discuss my dreams . Next time you see me , don 't be surprised if I 've eaten . [ SQUEALS ] Uncle Zoid ! You look young enough to be thrown back . Rich nephew ! Come over here and give your uncle a nice , big meal . So , here we are . A still-famous film comedian ... . And a rich , respected doctor with surviving patients . Eating in a restaurant , as we both often do . - So , you want to be a comedian , is it ? - lt 's my lifelong dream . That dream dies now ! You 're unfunny and untalented ! - That 's why you 're perfect for drama ! - Hm . Serious drama ? Perhaps it is time to give up comedy . I 'm putting together a big drama picture as we speak . The script is dynamite ! I know because I wrote it myself . By directing and starring ... ... I 'll be back on top after 50 miserable years ... - ... of fame . - Ah , fame . - Where do I come in ? - This film has a juicy part for you ... ... if you completely finance it with your money . So , are you in ? Uh , okay . How much do I have to invest ? Not much . Not much . A million dollars . Then it 's settled . Another big Hollywood deal ! - What can I get you ? - ls bread free ? - Yeah . - We 'll split an order . - What 's with Monstro ? - He promised his uncle a million bucks . I 've been here a day , and already I 'm a Hollywood phony . Perhaps I could call on TV 's Calculon to help ... ... now that I 'm in show biz . - Since when have you been in the biz ? - Long enough , little man . Long enough . I would be remiss if I didn 't bring you scripts ... ... that can make you an international film star . Tell me about the project . - lt 's a movie . - Interesting . Tell me more . Get this . For a scant $ 1 million investment ... ... you can be the star . And ? - And it 'll win you an Oscar . CALCULON : An Oscar , you say ? That would get me out of television once and for all . Let me see the script . No . No , I don 't like the font . Wait ! Harold Zoid ? - Was this written by the Harold Zoid ? - Written and xeroxed . Good heavens . A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid ! He 's one of my idols ! - You can guarantee me the Oscar ? - l can guarantee anything . - Then I 'll do it ! - Hooray ! Here 's your checkbook ! [ hammering ] Ladies and gentlemen , our director ... ... the legendary Harold Zoid ! Thank you . A more classic movie plot there isn 't . A son doesn 't want to follow in his father 's business . And that business is being president of Earth . The son is vice president . That makes sense . Wink , wink . - You said , " Wink , wink . " - No , I didn 't . Raise middle finger . [ BEEPlNG ] Now , remember , I can 't stress this enough , this is a talkie . So I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene . The Magnificent Three . Scene one , take one . And action ! Take back your gilded pen , Father . Signing bills into law was always your dream , not mine . Cut ! Cut it ! I said this is a talkie ! You 've got to emote more ! And you extras ? Wave your arms ! What is this , a morgue ? The Magnificent Three . Scene 1 0 , take 95 . Action ! And I mean circus-grade action . Sir ? I call upon you , not as a president ... ... but as a father ! Cut ! Cut it ! Would you show a little emotion ? People , please . Just because it 's a dramatic scene ... ... doesn 't mean you can 't do a little comedy . Throw a pie , for God 's sake ! No ! Cut ! Cut it ! Look , it 's all right , kid . We 'll get it in editing . That 's a wrap ! I 'm gonna see you at the premiere ! Which is ... ? Editing is a long and expensive process . We spent all the money on pies , so it 'll be ready Friday . Nice turnout . That Oscar 's practically on your mantel . I just pray they like me half as much as I do . I agreed to be your vice president ! But I never agreed to be your son ! - Thank you , Lieutenant Smith . - Good morning , Mr. Vice President . We 're missing it ! My life 's goal is to attend a Hollywood shindig . - Pay the valet the 2 bucks . - No ! It 's the principle of the thing . I see a parking lot ahead . [ screaming ] I have asked you to join me on the White House roof ... ... so we could have a heart-to-heart talk . I 'll never follow in your footsteps ! Here is my resignation as vice president ! No ! My son will not shame me like this ! I would sooner die , I would ! Father ! The ledge ! [ crashing ] Oh ... . The president is dead . Congratulations , Mr. President ! No ! BENDER : He 's a visionary ! - Everyone walked out . They hated it . Plagues have had better opening nights . You said the Oscar was practically mine ! That 's why I used the qualifier " practically . " You listen to me . I 'm out a million bucks ! Get me that Oscar , or you 're dead ! You and these sniveling lobsters ! Dead , you hear me ? Dead ! Oy ! Now he emotes . Four hundred categories and not a single nomination for me . - But you won this Golden Globe ! - That 's the Emmy of movie awards ! - l want an Oscar ! - Then maybe you should act better . It 's not about acting ... ... it 's about earning the respect of the creative community ! - We could rig the awards . - That 's fine ! [ engine REVS ] lt 's no use . The tar is too thick . Plus , I think I flooded it . Well , we 're gonna die . We might as well enjoy the sights . Oh , my God ! Sylvester Stallone ! This is where you live ? I thought you were a movie star . No , I 'm not . I 'm an even bigger liar than you ! My career went down the day they invented Smell-A-Vision . Calculon 's gonna kill us . It 's all everybody else 's fault ! All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die . What are you talking about ? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid . As a pathetic has-been and forgotten relic , they remember me ! It 's better to die now . No ! This is one death I won 't be responsible for . Zoidberg away ! Hi. I 'm Joan Rivers ' head . I 've had so many face-lifts , they finally lifted it right off my body ! It 's true ! It 's true ! Oh , oh , oh . Here comes Jack Nicholson 's DNA , reconstituted in a gorilla body ! Catering . Oh , oh . Ugh . Here 's washed-up actor what 's-his-name , Harold Zoid . Are you presenting one of the awards or getting one ? I 'm a seat filler . My only marketable skill is to occupy space . The second I don 't win that award , you 're cat food . Right , Boxy ? [ BEEPS ] ANNOUNCER : And now , the host of the 1 07 4th Academy Awards Billy Crystal ! Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels . Oh , you like that one , Jack ? Ooh , ooh , ooh . All right . We 're already one hour behind . NlCHOLSON : Ooh , ooh , ooh . Our first award tonight , Best Cinematography . You want to play tic-tac-toe before we eat our shoes ? Oh , I knew I 'd die at the bottom of a pit . But a pit full of tar ? What was that ? A tar dolphin ? Or a tar shark ? It 's some kind of hollow tube devoid of human life . The L.A. subway ! We can blast our way in and escape ! All right , but I still feel like having a shoe . - What category is it ? - They 're giving out minor awards . - They 're up to writing . - That leaves Best Product Placement ... ... and Best Actor . There 's no time . And the nominees for Best Product Placement are : SLURM : Star Trek : The Pepsi Generation . They Call Me Mr. Pibb . And Snow White and the 7 Ups . And now to present the award for Best Actor ... ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ... ... Dr. Zoidberg . [ cheering ] [ LOUDER cheering ] Okay , Boxy . Keep your prong on the trigger . And the nominees for Best Actor are : Sir Lawrence Ooooo in The Merchant of Venus . Hive Mind Gamma Seven X in Bikini Party Summer . The Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer . Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket . And , instead of the fifth guy , Calculon ... ... for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three . - He read the wrong name . - Play along , like with Marisa Tomei . Hooray ! I won 't be murdered ! I 'll live another day ! Another day of ... ... pathetic , forgotten misery . And the winner is ... . And the winner , instead of any of the nominees ... ... is the legendary Harold Zoid ! What ? Thank you ! Thank you so much ! Through my ups and downs ... ... I thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar . But tonight I realize what 's really important is to win two Oscars ! Ha ! Ha ! I 'm kidding . What matters in life is that people care about you ... ... whether it 's a whole crowd ... ... or just one die-hard fan . Aw . Thank you , nephew . Now I can die happy ... ... 1 0 seconds from now , when Calculon kills us . - Harold Zoid ! - Hit the deck ! - Where 's that Oscar ? - Here . Enjoy . Why are you upset ? It 's less fraudulent for you to have it . Yes . Yes , it 's a real beauty . Someday I hope to win one of my own . Then you 're not gonna kill us ? I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death . Yeah ! [ rumbling ] Earthquake ! Hit the deck ! Let the earth quake ! I 've got somebody 's Oscar ! - We made it ! I 'm at a Hollywood party ! - l 'm sorry . This is a private- - Oh , pardon me . I see you 're with Mr. Stallone . Subtitles by flanger [ english SDH ]

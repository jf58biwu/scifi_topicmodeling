 Previously on Farscape : I am as concerned about Zhann wellfare as you , Commander I simply thought you 'd like to see this before it went away Wormhole ! Prepare to launch my module There is a ship approaching ... What the hell ... Raptures everywhere Moya is frelled Allien penetration of our vessel I am pathfinder Neeyala This region of space ... i cannot funcionar under the bombardments ... We 've ricocheted into the distorted region that divides a wormhole from normal space time . How do we get the ships appart your ' Phaztillon ' generator , the key ? Yes . Rygel , what did you do ? you have opened It What 's your name Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hovalis How long have I been in this chamber ? 22 cycles I need empirical information about our position in the wormhole . Would you help ? Wormhole ... Normal space ... What are we doing here ? it 's only collecting images I think wormholes blinded him The creature you have seen ... exists exclusively inside wormholes . It 's amazing the number of species picked up by Neeyala 's gizmo . It 's possible to separate both ships But only one will survive . We have to pick which one . I do not enjoy sending you to your death These creatures , I will distract them They must not know your true mission . Frell we will abandon Moya . Pilot , I wish you were goin ' with us And now on Farscape : Winona , don 't fail me now . Crap . I 'm tellin ' you , Aeryn ... it was from Earth . A television transmission . What , you mean , like that Yoda from Degobah ? No , no , no , no , no ! Three Stooges . Whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo ... Well , whatever was in there , it 's not any use to us now . Do you know what this means ? No I don 't . It means that some part of this wormhole is 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 light years at most , away from Earth . It 's doable , I could get home . Amidst our misfortune . I 'm pleased for you , John . Yes ... I know ... . Selfish . Forget it . Where is Neeyala 's injured crew member ? What are you talking about ? Well , this is their blood . No , serpent blood No , no . This is Neeyala 's species blood , John . Zhaan , there was no one here . What about their crewmember ... who died , lost a limb during Starburst . Could the serpent have done that ? Well ... possibly , but why would they lie ? Yo , both of you . Even if Mr. Wiggles did chew on that guy , there was no one here . Their Phaztillon ... Generator ... what does it do ? It alters the phase physicality of an object ... conceivably . We wouldn 't be able to see it . Invisible I grow weak ... Neeyala . They must continue to believe that their Leviathan deteriorates faster than it is . Even the remotest hope will cause them to rally to her . Shut down their thermal condensers . Losing ability to regulate temperature should convince them to abandon ship . I will do what needs to be done . Including destroying them ... if I must . My name is John Crichton , I 'm lost . . an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe . I 'm trying to stay alive . Aboard this ship ... this living ship of escaped prisoners ... my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ? Protect my home ? Not show them ... you exist . But then you 'll never know ... the wonders I 've seen . There 's no way to tell if this is sabotage . Doesn 't matter anymore if it is . Moya 's frelled , and our only option is to go on Neeyala 's ship . And what if they are screwing us ? Especially if they 've screwed us . Means they have the upper claw . Nah . I 'm with D 'Argo on this . I think we need to know the truth . I do not trust Crichton 's judgement . Agreed , he claims to have seen Earth again , and I 'm sure he 's still talking to Scorpius . We all know where Rygel 's loyalties lie . Sadly , Chiana 's too . All right . Then whether they agree or not , we must stick to plan . First thing we do ... everybody acts normal . Don 't tip them off- - surprise may be our only ally . If Neeyala 's people aren 't sabotaging Moya ... we 'll go with them . If they are , we defeat them . I 'll repair some of the Nexus points . So they 're isolated from Moya 's main systems . That way , if they fry again ... We 'll know it 's them . Do you actually believe they 're using their generator to turn themselves invisible ? It would explain the sequence of decompressions . It 's geographically consistent with someone running from place to place . Which leads us to the blood in Pilot 's Den . The cavern beneath must be searched . Can we rely on you , Rygel ? Can we rely on Rygel ? All right . But not for you ... He has been on Moya the longest . ... for Moya ! Keep comms on restricted frequency . Switch comms to Deka . Neeyala ? Neeyala ... Neeyala is mine . First thing I want to get from them ... ... is a head count . What is this ? ! She sheds . What are you doing ? Well , now that we 've both asked ... I made 17 loops through the wormhole- - fried the organic bits on my module . If we stick with Moya , she makes less than one , and I 'm just looking for ... anything . ... Now , what the hell are you doing ? Formulating ideas . Formulating ideas ? Well , here 's an idea . Since we know nothing about this craft , how ' bout you stop ... pushin ' buttons ? All right . Two for two- - you 're not still feeling a little suicidal , are you ? Not in the least . Now , this looks interesting . Now , what do you suppose it does ? So far , scare the crap outta me . This ship feels somehow familiar to me . Yeah , you know , we have a crisis goin ' on out there ? I said I was formulating ideas . I heard you . Being on Moya ... a fugitive . It 's changed me . Well , if you 're not feeling suicidal , now is a bad time for a mid-life crisis . Chiana 's a young woman . She needs attention . D 'Argo ... you were focused on your son . It 's completely understandable . Still , I neglected her . Do you know what troubles me the most ? I did my best . I did the best I could , and it wasn 't enough . I still lost them both . My Grandmother used to say that life is ... a great wheel . Sometimes it grinds you down into the mud , and other times it ... lifts you up into the light . Are we strapped to this wheel ? That 's a given ... . Point is is that , most times , you get a second chance . Just gotta wait for the wheel . Aeryn , I 'm nine tiers below Pilot 's Den . I 've ah , found the alien girl . Well , half of her . Looks like a serpents bite to me . All right , well , open the gills on her head , and carefully remove some of the needles . What in hezmana for ? I like to know my enemy . Zhaan Zhaan That woman was invisible when she was killed in Pilot 's den . Their betrayal must be punished . Not like this , Zhaan . It won 't help Moya . I must control myself . It was a bad trade , Zhaan ... your health for mine . Don 't undervalue yourself . I 'm just a soldier . Don 't underestimate yourself . I 'm being realistic . Don 't be afraid to understand yourself . We 're not as different as you assume . Violent past , no faith in the future , and then a transformative experience aboard this very ship . My time grows short , and yours stretches before you . Use it wisely . A living ship ... I 've never heard of such a beast . Which obviously means it can 't exist . Oh , you 've ' so ' figured me out . I 'm not trying to . Be quiet , please . The gag remains an option . Is it true what the animal said ? that you 're all prisoners ? At some time or another , yes . Great ... just great . I take a multi-civilization tour for my birthday and barely make it through the first stop . I lose my deposit . My cousins get murdered . I 've been frozen for 22 cycles . I 've been captured by degenerate aliens . Attacked by a huge serpent 's ... Dead ! All of us , dead ! My love , dead ! My dreams , dead ! You , dead ! Me , dead . You dead , me dead , you dead , me dead , you dead , me dead ... . Your list is short and unworthy of entree to this ship of horror . Tortured by demons you can never know . Mocked by love that will never be . Oh , You want to cry young creature I will show you something that will make you cry forever . It 's me . Uh , tier five , hammond level . A circuit blew , but I had it off line . Someone was here , invisible . Get ready . The priviledge of working with techology is guaranteed by our families . Should we fail to return this ship , they will all be executed . Why didn 't you just lie and tell us both ships could survive separation ? We would have happily remained here and perished with Moya . I did not wish to see you die . But , I incorrectly assumed that given the choice , you would take the rational option . So , just to be sure you helped things along . You cripple a living ship and we jump at the chance to escape with you . ... I trusted you . Your feelings for Moya and Pilot are matched by those for our families . ... Allow personal passions to cancel each other out . What 's left ? Wormhole techology . Yes , garnered at great cost . With potential beyond measure . Would you compare that with the lives of a ship and Pilot which , I assure you , are doomed anyway . Moya lives , Neeyala You misjudged her will and ours . Will ? is a poor substitute for beersien alloy , when crushed by astronomical tidal forces . That 's still no excuse for sabotaging Moya . Stop Kreetago . He carries no communications device . That would give him away . He will continue his mission until your ship is incapacitated . Then we shall find a way to stop him . DRD 's ... find this frelling bastard . Very krell , D 'Argo . How 'd you think of it ? Watch for disruption in the beams . His needles ! My leg D 'Argo I 'm hit ! Tourniquet . It 'll stop the poison . With what ? ! He 's out here somewhere . Where ? Don 't look ... listen . Zhaan Chiana 's got one of their needles in her leg . Rygel , do you still have the spikes from the alien corpse ? Yes , why ? Meet me in my lab now . If this young girl dies , I will come back for you and I will most certainly lose any chance I have left ... of meeting my Goddess . Explain . The generator has reached optimization phase . And what does that mean ? Once activated , the powercell will engorge a final time . And when it releases ... we 'll find out if our ships are destined to separate . Aeryn , you want to hold off ? Impossible Even now the reactor shuts down permanently . Listen ! ... My crew is dead . This is our one chance to avoid the certainty of joining them . Go ahead . Be aware , should our vessels disengage , the built-in timing favors yours being the one destroyed . How long do we have ? Hard to discern with the damage . Maybe an arn , not more . Ridiculous . We tried Starburst . Everybody heaved . Neeyala has fixed it so that when we separate , she enters the wormhole while Moya is ejected through wall and into normal space . From hetch-impossible to a dead stop . That 's sub-atomic dispersal ! All perfect reasons to be on her ship , strapping in for the ride . Starburst could rotate Moya so it 's us who go into the wormhole , Where 's she 'll get ripped apart from the stress . I 've flown there , remember ? We voted , Rygel . I didn 't get to vote . I was your proxy . Pilot 's in a coma . Moya 's half-decompressed . Nothing works . Fine ! I 'll kill half an arn . I want you to reconnect Pilot to Moya 's external senses . The Neural Cluster ? D 'Argo , we shredded those synapses . It 'll take all three of us . Splice and hook , nothing permanent , I want to give Pilot a chance . He 's unconcious . Well , do your part . He 'll be awake . What if we 're not done when the time comes ? Then we race to the other ship . We gotta seal all the chambers on the outer rim . Starburst is gonna spin us like a top . One decompression and we 're vapor . Once secure , I 'll overload Pilot with Moya 's adrenal secretions . I really blew this one , Aeryn . Not done yet . It didn 't disappear . That 's new . 'Cause the generator 's fully on , right ? Correct . We now share the serpents phase existence , and will , until separation . It just keeps gettin ' better . ... One-Adam-Twelve , guys . The critter 's part of our reality now . Be careful out there . I 'll try and chase it to the outer rim . You do anything to upset the balance that I have set into place ... Zip it , T Lady ! You had your shot , we 're takin ' ours . You can 't leave us tied up like this ! What if that thing comes back ? Mm . These are very similar to the quellian tibor 's mating spikes . Pliable root , tensile fiber stalk , metalline venom tip . Will she be all right ? Well I believe so . But not if Rygel hadn 't secured these other needles for anti-body serum . I heard the plan , I 'm ready to go . The more your blood pumps , the more chance you 'll make a liar out of me , child Ever my protector . It is not you that needs protecting . It 's the rest of the universe I fear for . When I was first incarcerated on this ship ... wild and murderous . I could not conceive how I would survive . I heard a rumor that a Luxan Warrior was a fellow prisoner . I actually prayed that the brute would succumb to hyper-rage and kill me . How ironic is that There is a planet out there that will heal you . The intent is noble . The result is in the hands of the gentle Goddess . Too bad about Pilot , I liked him . He liked you too . How do you know ? He told me . He did ? Comms chip . What are you doing ? Deputizing you , debutante . See those lights ? They 're cycling faster . Hear that noise ? Pitch is rising . At some point ... we 're out of time . I want you to make a judgement call . When you think it 's gonna blow ... you get us back here . What ? ! I mean ... I don 't know how ... Look ... princess ! I know that this ... trip to Krugerland was not on your itinerary , but believe it or not , I know exactly how you feel . Don 't presume to know anything about me . You hold this steady , be more afraid of what you 're aiming at . I 've never done anything like this before . None of us have . You killed my cousin ! Not on purpose ! He was a corpsicle , and your other cousin ... he didn 't last half a minute defrosted . Then why did I survive ? I don 't know . You 're not sick . Maybe they shanghaied you for body parts . You 're the freebie . Everything I have seen so far is despicable ! Welcome ... to the Federation Starship , SS Buttcrack ! Decompression , Tier 3 ! It 's rolling ! Internal airtights are giving way ! Zhaan , do not enter Pilot 's access corridor . Vent Tier Three and Four Air Bladders- - back-pressure the hatches . On three , big man , you go four . He 's going to be cut off . Do something ! No blocked- - outer hull rupture . Long way . Chiana 's okay . So I heard . Serpent ! It 's a good call on Rygel and the gill darts . Anybody ever tell you how good you are around here ? Matter of fact , just recently . Go on , keep movin ' . I got a plan . Don 't tell me you have a plan . What 's wrong with them ? They never work . Damn these doors . They always work . Not the way you detail them . Hey , look , I get results . You 're hung up on details ! Your plans never work ! This way . - How did this ship get open ? - Aeryn get in here ! But we don 't know anything about it Aeryn ! Just get in here . This is wrong . D 'Argo rubbed the damn thing , now get in ! Crichton , you idiot ! D 'Argo found a forcefield here somewhere . Just gotta find the button . Idiot ? Ha ! World class plan . Why hasn 't anyone vented Tier Four 's airbladders ? Zhaan . Uh , sorry . We ran into a little problem here . The passageway 's beyond have opened to space . There is no way I can get to Pilot . Your excuses have failed him again , John . That 's it . All the outer chambers are sealed . How 'd you go , Heavy D ? The air bladders are completely vented , but we don 't have enough back pressure to reverse the damage done on Pilot 's quarters . If ... Pilot 's dead ... Yes we 're out of here . Aeryn , it 's all you now . Link number four ... open to space . Only one more to go . Jool , how 's the timing ? I 'm not sure . Do better . Faster ... maybe . Approximately one third increase . Geometrically building . The alien says I 'm right . Third level in is compromised ... like the last two . I beseech your wisdom . Hatale , I entreat your spirit . Hatala , I petition your mercy . The gentle are stricken , the kind are helpless , the silent uncounted . I 'm approaching Pilot 's Den . Even as a tenth level Pa 'u I am weary and without resources . Oh , Goddess ... of all things holy . Hear my soul . This gentle ship is pledged to my care and I am powerless . Though I am but a mote upon your winds grant me one supplication . Ask anything in return . Ask anything in return . The seal has held . The air is thin , but it is breathable . Yes ! Thank you ... . Thank you ... . If we 're going to try this , I 'm going to need Moya 's adrenal secretions pumping on my command . Just tell me when . So , we 're agreed ? One shot . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! You should 'nt be up . These hands ... can wire a whole lot of neural cluster Get me there ! Time ? Fractionally faster ... . John ? Yeah ? Why ... is this ship ... . . so important ? Still worried about your parents after 22 cycles ? Yes . That 's how we feel about Moya . She raised us . Bravo ! Bravo ! Magnificent ! Encore , encore , John ! John Crichton ... was riviting in the role of cheerleader . Rallying his comrades in aid of the stricken ship he had earlier betrayed ... That 's my dad 's Tux . Take it off ! - This is not mine ! - You can choose the venue , - This is not my Tux ! - John , but I 'm going to make sure we look good . Yeah ! Macon ... Georgia - Macon , Georgia . - Ah ! College - spring break , hitch hiking to see the strippers - on the way to Lauderdale- - this is the truckstop ... Hey ! Yo , yo ! No , you do not enter my reality ! You do not talk to me in my reality ! If I want you , I 'll call ! Those are the rules ! Unacceptable . And I suggest you sue for peace now . Your distractions are many , while I 'm totally dedicated to getting a measure of freedom . No more dumpsters , John . Tabled . What do you want ? You might fool them with your rah-rah ... but I know the disappointment of letting Neeyala 's ship be destroyed . Yeah , well you can 't have everything you want . I 'll figure out wormholes by myself . Green Chevy ... I had one of those . It 's not too late to change the outcome . Oh , you know everything about me . Do you want to make a point ? Excellent , excellent- - yes . And with familiarity , we might develop a shorthand which will ... benefit us both . Try this ... You would do ... well , anything to save your ship . ... Anything Make a point . Why assume less of Neeyala ? Jool Jool Adrenal secretions fully opened , Aeryn . Goddess speed . Pilot Come on , Pilot . Feel that nice warm adrenaline flow . Everywhere ! Officer Sun ? Hello . Hello . No ... n ... Wake up ! Neeyala Let 's work together on this . We 'll all survive . We 'll get you home . Family executed . Me to follow . Knowledge lost . No thanks ... We both defend that which we love . You shouldn 't have lied . You should not have been in our path . And I should have listened to Kreetago and destroyed you when I had the chance . ... I have failed my crew , and my ship . Now I will make it up to them . Don 't make me shoot you . Ion-charged hydrostatic vapor residue in atmospheric suspension . One spark and we 're nuclear ? Meager as it is , you do know more than any species we 're aware of . We can find a way ! If my ship survives , even without me , a beacon will attract our flight command . If by some ... unfathomable circumstance , your vessel survives ... We share a joined hull . I have just infused our beacon into the Leviathan 's superstructure . We 're gonna have ... another set of bad guys chasing us across the universe . Unfortunately , Commander , not you . I don 't think so . Hey , Neeyala You think this is gonna get you what you want ? ! What I want you cannot give ! Jool , you nitwit ! I have never before released my bristles to kill . Your forgiveness . Melted tips ? Neeyala , what 's the matter ? Can 't you hear me ? That 's a hell of a scream . Thanks . Come on ! We 're almost out of time . Crichton ... it 's Aeryn ... Pilot 's just doing the calculations now ... It won 't be long . We 're out of time , Aeryn ! Just a little bit more ? We are out of time ! Which ones ? Stop yelling at me ! The yelling starts in about two seconds- - which ones ? These ! I 'm pretty sure . You 're sure ? Be sure ! I 'm hurt ! She hit me in the head ! Well , did you see the order ? ! This , this , this , this , this . What the hell is that ? Diagnostical Helix . The mathematical representation of quantum elasticity . Right , right , right . That 's good , that 's enough ... Enough ! Enough ! Thank you ... over there . Guys , I got Zhaan here with me . Where are you ? On my way . We 're not quitting . D 'Argo Stark We 're never gonna make it , John . We voted to stay together . No matter what . Even Rygel ? Pilot likes me ! You know , I would care to say that anything that gets me out of here alive is what we should be doing ! You are a very ungrateful and selfish woman . Please remain silent from now on ! Zhaan , none of this is gonna matter if Pilot doesn 't I am ready ... Pilot , hey ! Man , it 's good to see ya ! How you doin ' ? No , no , answer that later . We got a serious situation here ! What- - what do we gotta do ? Impulse data from each test of their generator was stored in Moya 's neural circuitry , allowing me to construct a statistical model ... eah , yeah , yeah , whatever- - I trust you to do the math . Just tell me what we gotta do ! I must initiate Starburst approximately seven microts after the generator is unleashed . Oh , dear Chanu , please don 't let me die this way , please ! Who is that creature ? That 's ballast , ignore it . How exact do we have to be ? Not as close as you think . Aeryn Ah , once we start spinning ... Moya 's weight gives us an advantage with the gravitational pull of the wormhole . And Neeyala 's vessel will be the one ejected directly into space . Pilot , you want to try a little manual point-and-shoot , just in case you fade ? Yes ... Commander . Crichton , no You feel lucky ? No , no , no . I 've never flown a wormhole . I think it should be you . Aeryn , it 's easy ... the exits are clearly marked , and you 're better with Moya . No , John Zhaan ... I 've got this . What 's going on ? Well , just a guess , but somebody 's got to actually trigger the generator . Get back . Both of you , get back . No ! Aeryn . Aeryn , do you see this disco ? I put it here ; I 'm gonna take it away ! Crichton ... Aeryn ... enough . You are both so good at gauging reality . Yet in this instance ... Zhaan ... there 's a planet out there . A long shot at best , John . The illness that is ravaging my body ... is frighteningly efficient . No So , while I 'm still sound of mind and spirit , I choose this path for myself . Zhaan , you 're needed here . At one time , I believe I was , but then a family was born . You birthed it . We love you , Zhaan . Decompression , decompression . Where to go , where to go , where to go ? Zhaan , it 'll be easy . I 'll start the generator ; I 'll come across . If it is so easy , allow me . Zhaan , no No ... n ... No more If I am so needed , and so valued , and so wise . Then you will honor my words . You will obey me . For the longest time I feared physical demise , because my spiritual essence was suspect , but now I know I 'm worthy . Now I know the transgressions have melted from my soul . Now I know I shall meet my Goddess , and be accepted to her bosom . Sensitive D 'Argo ... exhuberant Chiana ... wise Rygel ... selfless Aeryn ... innocent Crichton ... My children . My teachers , my loves . There is no guilt . There is no blame . Only what is meant to be . Grow through your mistakes , and know that if patient , redemption will find you . " Wait for the wheel . " Thank you , John Crichton . No No Stark Stark ... link with me , my beautiful . Guide me to the place of rest . Melt into my spirit , Stark ... so that I may share my last moments , with the man I love . Good-bye , you big , beautiful , blue bitch . Nooooooo ! Always together . Joined as one . Peace of mind , peace of spirit , piece of soul . Goodbye my love . Aeryn , you gotta fly this baby . I ... appreciate your concern , Rygel . It 's just that , you 've never paid this much attention to me before . I think maybe you haven 't noticed . I like you Pilot . I like you a lot . And I know Zhaan did too . Shame you didn 't get to say good-bye . When I was unconcious and in pain ... she came to me , inside my mind . I already ... miss her . I already ... miss her . Ow ! Oh ... wait for me ! Not that way on Moya . You want to move faster ? Get better shoes . Or maybe , get in better shape . Do you know how much these shoes cost , young whore ? For me ? Three sex acts . Probably double that for you . You have some nerve to talk to me that way . One of my very very best friends has just gone . Right now , I 'm- - I am nothing but nerve . You want someone to like you ? Invest in a mirror . Honestly , Aeryn , you don 't have to hover over me . To be honest in return , Stark . I 'd expect you to be a bit more upset . Oh , after fifteen thousands deaths ... what 's fifteen thousand , and one . The woman you loved . Those I minister to in their final moments , are usually resistant to the process . Not Zhaan . Imagine being so at peace , so certain what was next was better . She doesn 't want us upset . She wants us to carry on in her spirit . Positive , and hopeful . And you can do that ? Not always . I would appreciate you hovering then . You 're in a court , not in Clancy 's pool room . Sit down ! I 'm a victim of circumstance . Ah , Who are you hitting ? Why is it always the gentle ones that pay the price for everyone else 's ambition ?

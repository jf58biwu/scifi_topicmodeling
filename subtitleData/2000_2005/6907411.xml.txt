 What 's going on ? Hurry up and get dressed . Huh ? Well ... Um ... Teacher ! Mr. Yamamoto ! Something crazy is happening on top of the roof ! It looks like a tornado . A tornado ? Subaru . Subaru !

You seem to prefer that method more . What ? ! You can 't gauge your true strength with something as cumbersome as power . Don 't talk like you know everything ! Power isn 't something you rely on . It allows you to gauge your ability , based on how well you can use it . Shut up ! Hey ! What are you doing ? The first bell rang already . Stop making so many thonk-wonk , thonk-wonk noises on the roof ! " Thonk ? " That 's enough . Can you see ? I can 't see anything . Stop pushing , you idiot ! Above the main building ! The roof ? What are you doing ? Hurry up and open it ! It 's not opening ! Is it all right now ? What are you all doing ? What do you think ? We heard that there was something crazy going on on top of the roof , so .. Same as you guys ! We wanted to see what 's going on . That 's too bad . The ruckus is over . That wasn 't much of a rooftop duel . Moriguchi and ... who is that ? What 's he wearing ? It 's a school uniform , right ? Hey ! Go back to your classrooms ! Y ... yes sir ! Well , that 's that ... Everyone comes to watch if you start trouble first thing in the morning . It 's fine . The three of you go back to your classroom . But teacher ... What is it , Moriguchi ? No ... Nothing ... Even if I say : " They were fighting using telekinetic powers ! " , no one 's going to believe me . And so ... Because of this ... So for now , I 'm keeping quiet . This is both good and bad , but I 'm such a rational thinker . ... balance and environment . There are many factors , but ... Come on ! Tell us what happened ! It was just a fight ! How many times do I have to repeat myself ? But , why did the vice president call Subaru out ? Shady reasons ? Shady reasons ? Shady reasons ? Ahh ! Shut up ! By the way , where is Subaru ? Yama-chu called him . Why weren 't you called ? How should I know ? What to do with you both ... Moriguchi 's making trouble , but so are you . Murata saw it , didn 't he ? Yes . That 's not good ... It 's one thing for you guys go at it , but ... No , I 'm not saying that 's a good thing , but ... It 's just that Murata has nothing to do with all this . I 'm sure he 'll be fine . How can you say that ? Because he 's the class rep . Why 'd you do that ? Why did you call for people ? But more than that , why are you watching me ? Who ordered you to ? No one ordered me ... No one ... ordered me ... Why do you ... Stop it , Kyoichi ! Hachiyou . Anyway , getting seen wasn 't good . I hear that kid with the glasses is Murata from second year homeroom C. I 'll make up for what I 've done . The transfer student with mysterious powers . I 'm sure everybody feels the same way about wanting to know his secret . So , in that case ... So , um ... hey ... There 's something you want to ask , right ? Huh ? Do you want to come to my place , instead of discussing it here ? Huh ? S ... sure ! What 's wrong ? It 's ... just that I 've never seen a place like this from the inside . My house is this way . What 's wrong ? For you . There 's no point in acting lady-like now . Shut up ! Hey . These sweet bean buns are really good , so have as many as you like . O ... okay . She 's my sister , Setsuna . She 's a college student . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you ! Um ... Do you two live together ? No way ! I live in Tokyo . He lives here by himself . Anyway sis , you should stop sneaking into other people 's houses . Grandma told me I could ! Besides , why not ? Your only sister came all the way here to hang out with you ! And I always bring you goodies like this ! You 're the one that always eats them . It tastes better when we all eat them together . Have some . Have some . Uhh ... Oh , that 's right . Thanks to sis , I totally forgot about it . What ? What do you want to ask ? About what happened this morning ? Yeah , I want to ask about that too , but first ... Is it all right if I ask ? Yeah . You ... Why are you at the Sanemori family home when your last name is Subaru ? Say what ? Well , um ... It 's all right . You don 't have to explain if it 's a really complicated family situation . B ... but the doorplate said Sanemori so I was wondering why your last name is Subaru ... I was thinking a home-stay , or a divorce ... No , my little sister 's the one who said that , but ... So umm ... Oh boy ... Huh ? Huh ? That was unexpected . You know , you 're pretty good ! Huh ? That was great . That was a good one . Yeah . They 're letting me live at their home . You were right when you guessed a home-stay . Oh ... My relatives are sis , and grandpa , and ... Apparently it was a promise that my grandpa made with the old lady of this house . When I turned fourteen , I was supposed to come to this house . And so you came ? From Nagano ? Yup . By the promise made long ago , I hereby present my grandson , Muryou , to Lady Momoe 's care . Understood . Pleased to make your acquaintance . Wow . That 's like something out of an old movie . I didn 't know this house was so formal . You 're not from this town ? Huh ? Well , I 'm sure my father 's paying tax to the town ... No . I mean , I was wondering if you 're like me , and moved here from somewhere else . Oh yeah , four years ago from Tokyo . I see ... Huh ? What is it ? Then , you don 't know anything about Tenmo . Huh ? Go ahead , Muryou . Tell him . I think he 'll be fine . Huh ? Huh ? Is there something ... ? W ... what 's wrong ? Good timing . Let 's go watch . Huh ? Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Th ... That 's ... It 's an invasion weapon from space . And that 's ... The Fighter of Justice appears ! It 's all right . It can 't be helped . It only knows how to do a power-push . I 'm glad it 's okay . Huh ? So ... What do you want to do ? Where do you want me to start ? Huh ? Oh um ... The giant battle was pretty realistic and exciting , so ... Let 's go over it tomorrow . Sure . I have some advice for you . Yes ? For the next couple of days , you should go to bed with your shoes on . Huh ? Where 's Hajime ? He said he has things to think about so he went to his room . He 's just running away 'cause I beat him yesterday ! All right ! Oh ... Victory ! Victory ! Let 's see ... So then , Kyokoyama , shall I show you how it 's done ? Just you watch . Ready ... So , Subaru has some kind of connection with the alien incident that happened before ... And , from what I understand about this morning 's fight he also has some kind of connection with Kyoichi Moriguchi . On top of that , it seems like the people from the student government have a connection to the incident , too . And , it also appears that the people from around here have a connection , as well ... Wait a minute ... This makes it sound like everyone has some kind of connection . What is it ? Are you done thinking about things ? I 'm done for today . I 'll think about it tomorrow . Mom 's strong ! She 's nothing like you ! What did you say ? Hey , what the ... ! I 'm the best . You 're such an egomaniac ! West East Akashio Yama no Umi Hit Hit West East Akashio Yama no Umi Hit Hit Go get him , Mom ! West East Akashio Yama no Umi Hit Hit For the win ! Show me what you 've got ! Ready ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! So , night descended on Tenmo and I postponed my deep thoughts . But I decided to ready my shoes for tonight . A huge battle and advice from a beautiful woman it felt like it was the beginning of an adventure , sort of ... Wha ? Sorry about that ! Glasses ! Glasses ! It was definitely a good idea to have my shoes on . Thanks , Setsuna ! Currently on Patrol By picking up the receiver you will be automatically connected to the station . Why now ! ? S ... stop ! What are you doing ? Someone ! Someone ! Help ! Someone ! Help me ! I 'm over here . Over here . If you don 't use that correctly , it 'll be bad . Did you actually get permission to use it ? Destruction of property . You shouldn 't be using your powers needlessly . See what I mean ? Don 't ! Do you want me to help you ? Well , it is one of the things I have to do tonight , so ... This is destruction of property , too . Are you two all right ? Huh ? Yeah ... Aren 't you glad you wore your shoes ? Yeah ... Well , I 'll see you tomorrow ... But , I guess it 's already tomorrow . It 's two o 'clock . But , why ... Huh ? Subaru ? What ? Were you up late last night ? Yeah . It 's big news ! Aliens fought on the shores of Tenmo . I was up until 3 : 00 A.M. watching a special report about it . You should have taped it . You idiot . It 's better to watch something like that when it 's actually being aired ! But , I wonder what the white giant is ? Oh come on , guys ! It 's that ! It 's that awesome thing ! What are you talking about ? It looks like the gohei streamers they have at the shrine . You think so ? This is it right here !

 And now , ladies and gentlemen , prepare yourselves for the match you have all been waiting for . [ announcer ] Tonight 's main event .. the Royal Reptile Rumble ! . Thank you ! Thank you ! Tonight , fighting out of the blue corner ... at a fearsome 6 feet , 240 pounds : the dreaded Python ! [ crowd booing ] And in the red corner , standing at a towering 6 ' 4 " , weighing in at a monstrous 265 pounds- - Will there be anything else , Mr. Broddick ? . Box of Raisinets . You love him ! The Boa ! I want a good , clean fight . No kicking , biting or kneeing . [ bell dings ] - What was that for ? . - Fun . We are here to celebrate , aren 't we ? . [ ringing ] Hold on to that thought . Broddick . - It 's Ramon . - Who ? . - It 's Ramon . - Ah , Ramon ! ? Como estas , mi amigo ? . So what 's the ETA on our guest from Southeast Asia ? . - It 's loaded . We 're leaving . - I knew I could count on you . Call me if you have any problems . Just remember this delivery is COD . A generous compensation will be awaiting you and your associates upon your arrival . Good . Patronizing prick . Stupid cunt . Did you tell the hack I said hi ? . Believe it or not , the " hack " has our package , and it 's en route as we speak . You still haven 't told me what the package is . It wouldn 't be much of a surprise if I told you , would it ? . Let 's move out . We have a problem back here . It 's awake . [ man ] All right . Pull it over . I said Raisinets . [ creature growling ] What the fuck ? . - It 's awake . - It 's been shot up with 2,000 cc 's of tranq . It 's awake now . [ creature snarling ] I don 't think it 's supposed to do that if it 's sleeping . No , it 's not . This is supposed to be your job . - You 're going to open it ? . - You are . Hit the blue button . - But- - - The blue button . Is that thing awake ? . The blue button opens the side panel just enough to help give this thing sweet dreams for the rest of the trip . Blue button . Come on ! [ screams ] [ beeping ] Oy ! These are $ 500 seats ! We 're the ones paying for the view here ! Get back in your yard and play . [ snarling ] [ roaring ] - What are you doing ? . - What do you think we brought this for ? . You see those bullets doing anything ? . This will . Where 's the dynamite ? . It 's right ... It 's right here . [ bell rings ] Yeah ! Yes ! [ hissing ] Broddick ! - Run out of hot water ? . - No ! I just got attacked by a fucking anaconda in there . Lucky for you , the bite of a common garter snake is non-lethal . You shit . You know I hate snakes . Hence , I was merely trying to condition you for this weekend 's hunt . You 're kidding me . That 's what Ramon flew in from overseas- - a snake ? . Not just a snake , baby . This one is a real monster . And it 's all ours . Unless , of course , you 're too afraid . In which case , the boys and I will have all the fun . I said that I hated snakes . - I never said I was afraid of them . - That 's my girl . [ squeaking ] Oh ! - Where were we ? . - [ phone rings ] [ sighs ] Talk to me , Ramon . This is Clover Trucking . You leased one of our trucks . Is there a problem ? . We haven 't heard from the drivers , and they aren ' t answering our pages . - Why the hell not ? . - I don ' t know . I can connect you to the shift supervisor . - They 've lost the trucks . - T old you Ramon was a hack . Fat fuck ! Do you realize how much money I spent for this weekend ? . The gentlemen I 've invited are extremely wealthy and extremely well-connected . They are flying out here for the sole purpose of hunting a giant snake . What am I supposed to do now ? . Offer them an Easter egg hunt ? . [ TV ] ... in rural Pennsylvania . According to local police , the two vehicles and the remains of five bodies were found by state police earlier this morning . County officials have yet to determine whether the accident- - Do you want me to call the boys and tell them the hunt is off ? . No . Just tell them we 're simply rescheduling the date and location . ... the contents of the vehicles . Sources tell us of huge crates filled with high-yield explosives , automatic weapons and what appears to be a gigantic pet cage . For this reporter , we may be in the beginning of an appearance by Al-Qaida in the middle of the heartland of middle America . For Channel 15 Action News , I 'm Kent Humphries . And we 're out . " lnaction News " is more like it . Al-Qaida ? . It looks more like a big car wreck . That 's why you are where you are and I am where I am , Louis . Really ? . I thought maybe it was because I am the cameraman and you are the reporter , Kent . [ chuckles ] That 's us . Start rolling . Rolling , rolling , rolling . Kent Humphries , Channel 15 Action News . So , is the government officially deeming this an accident , a multiple homicide or possibly an Al-Qaida terrorist operation ? . Al-Qaida ? . - Yes . - I wouldn 't know . I just got here . Certainly this is an interesting position to be in , Agent- - Sharpe . Now if you don 't mind . Is the government willing to say anything about the vehicle 's contents ? . Or about who the men were and what they were doing ? . And any possible connection to any Al-Qaida terrorist operation ? . I wouldn 't know . I just got here . So there you have- - So there you have it , ladies and gentlemen . You heard it here first on Channel 1 5 Action News . A possible terrorist operation foiled . Five men in the prime of their lives , struck down in this senseless tragedy . What were their names ? . What were they doing ? . Why were they here ? . Kent Humphries , Action News . [ siren wailing ] Outstanding . Agent Sharpe , what do you think of this ? . Do we tag this as body number six ? . I think it 's what 's left of bodies two , three , four and five . - What 's that ? . - Scale . Found it in the case . That 's a big scale . It 's a big case . What is that ? . I thought you shut off number 6 . I did . What the hell ? . Aaah ! Carl ! Carl ! Carl ! Carl ! [ screaming ] Carl ! Carl ! Carl ! [ screaming ] [ Carl groans ] [ roaring ] [ screams ] Agent Sharpe ! Agent Sharpe ! Would you mind putting my evidence back ? . Sorry . I found this in the back of the truck . Where exactly does that lead ? . That 's one of the access tunnels to the Philadelphia water treatment plant . Thank you , Deputy . You should clean up . You got a piece of liver on your chin . Right . Maybe I should . Looks like it 's some sort of tranquilizer dart . But for what ? . I 'm not sure yet . But whatever it is , it woke up . Agent Sharpe , I just got a call from the treatment plant . Apparently , they were just attacked . Attacked by what ? . They said a giant snake . Call the plant back . Tell them I want this entrance sealed , all main lines connected to it turned off , the facility itself evacuated . Are you asking me to have them turn off the only major source of water for this half of the state ? . I 'm ordering , not asking . I don 't mind telling you that people in this state get a little upset when their toilets don 't flush and the sinks are dry . I see . We 'll need maps and diagrams of every aqueduct , pipe and tunnel , all ways leading in and out of that system . If that thing 's down there , I 'm not about to let it back out , not until we can call in some serious firepower . Call in two reserve units . Have the highway patrol lock off all traffic within five miles . Then I want everything we 've got on the Larson project . That was a ClA project gone bad . A couple big snakes got loose in Russia and wiped out the entire team . - Just get me the file . - Right . And get me Monica Bonds . [ woman ] I don 't work out . Two minutes isn 't bad , but I can beat it . Tyler here 's half fish . Yeah ? . I bet I can take him . I don 't think so , cupcake . I got 50 bucks that says I can . I 'll take that action . - Make that two . - This 'll be sweet . Tyler was in Navy Seal school , before he got discharged . Really ? . I 've done a little Navy ordnance and mine-sweeping myself . - You searched for mines ? . - Yep . - With Navy divers ? . - Nope . Dolphins . [ girls cheering ] [ guys cheering ] Thirty seconds ! We only have 30 seconds ! Come on , buddy . Speak to me . Are you all right ? . Here . I know CPR . I don 't know what you did to him down there . Just stay back . You all right ? . You okay ? . Did I win ? . Bro , you got spanked by a chick . Thank you . Thank you . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Thank you . Monica Bonds ? . Who 's asking ? . Agent Sharpe wants to see you . There 's a car waiting to take you to the airport . - How are things at the institute ? . - Great . We got three new dolphins coming in next month . Working hard and making some real progress . I can see that . I didn 't have time to put a full ensemble together . I appreciate you coming here on such short notice . With you , Alan , it 's always short notice . What are we doing out here in the backcountry ? . Your boys told me to pack for Philadelphia . How well does your equipment work out of the water ? . Why do I get the feeling you 're about to ask me for four years of research ? . Haven 't had a chance to field-test it out of the water yet , but the sensor pads were designed for wet or dry applications . It should work fine . Well , you 're about to get your field test , compliments of Uncle Sam . What kind of doctor is he ? . Dr. Emmett is one of the world 's leading herpetologists . That 's kind of creepy . You haven 't even met the man . In my book , people who play with snakes are creepy . It 's locked . Maybe there 's another entrance . Emmett ? . He 's probably got the whole crazy , bug-eyed , Christopher Lloyd , Jeff Goldblum mad scientist thing going on . Pasty skin , doesn 't see the sun much . Definitely has social interaction issues . Agent Sharpe ? . Yeah . No . He 's ... Alan Sharpe , Federal Bureau of lnvestigation . And this is Monica Bonds with the Miami Aquatic Research lnstitute . Hi . Pleased to meet you . Please come in . Thank you . [ beeping ] Impressive lab . It used to be . I 'm working out of pocket for the moment . The place requires constant funding . I know the feeling . Doesn 't it bother you , working with these things ? . I mean , one bite and you 're history . Snakes are like other creatures . Respect them , and they 'll respect you . You have to know what you 're doing , especially with the poisonous kind , like the one you 're tapping there . [ hisses ] I understand you 've grown a rather large snake here on the premises . She 's a constrictor- - a Scarlet Queen boa . May we see her ? . Mm . [ buzzer sounding ] Follow me . [ beeping ] You need all this for a snake ? . You might want to stay close . It 's a little smaller than I imagined . This isn 't Betty . This is Betty 's lunch . You feed snakes to snakes ? . I inject the food snakes with a dose of venom extract , which is then digested by the Scarlet boa . - Won 't that kill her ? . - Doses are minute . Absorbed into her bloodstream before she knows they 're there . Her system then works to create an antibody which I can then harvest . Betty is the largest constrictor on the reserve , probably the largest Scarlet boa on the planet . And she produces a vast amount of antibody for my research . You 're creating an antivenom . Trying to , anyway . It 's all extremely interesting , Doctor , but hardly the reason I came . Where 's the boa ? . [ chuckles ] She 's standing on him . Shit ! Aaah ! [ shrieks ] [ roaring ] Outstanding . This is big . And big is nice . Well , color me officially curious . Assuming we didn 't come all the way out here just to see some gigantic snake , I 'm dying to know what kind of situation could possibly require the use of his boa and my implants . Doctor Emmett , how well would your boa perform in an uncontrolled environment ? . Well , I wouldn 't know . She 's the first of her kind to be born and raised entirely in captivity . - Would she hunt ? . - Absolutely . Snakes , no matter how they 're raised , have the instinct to hunt . It 's a matter of survival . In that case , I 'd like to use your boa to help me find this . Here comes the party . [ tires squealing ] My good friend Tex from Lubbock . [ tires squealing ] Mr. Foley ... our military 's greatest sniper . Try not to stare so hard , Eve . [ tires squealing ] - Mr. Danner and- - - His son James . Wife took the truck . Good old family get-together . I thought there was one more . There is . Littlefield , master huntsman . Gentlemen , glad to see you all could make it to our little ... safari . [ Broddick ] I apologize once again for the last-minute change in venue . Luckily , rearranging one 's travel plans becomes a lot easier when one has access to their own jet . A series of unfortunate events has somewhat complicated the hunt I promised to deliver to you . However , being that I am a man of my word , I 've decided to do one better . That 's why I 'm going to deliver you to the hunt . Babe , would you do the honors ? . I 'm sorry . Would anyone else care for a drink ? . We are fully stocked here , so choose your poison . An ashtray and a beer . Make it two . I 'll have a Sprite , please . Can I have a cold one , too , actually ? . Uh-huh . - And for you , Mr. Foley ? . - Surprise me . Since this is my first time hunting this particular predator , I thought it only fitting that I invite those associates who would truly appreciate the experience . And I assure you this is a once-in-a-lifetime , gentlemen , an experience that will truly separate the men ... from the beasts . We are hunting one of the most cunning predators on this planet . We are the knights that are going to slay the dragon . If you take a look inside the expedition dossiers my beautiful associate Eve has prepared , you 'll see I 've taken the liberty of mapping out a few routes . We will be landing outside Philadelphia in approximately two hours . Eyes on your own paper . From there we shall depart for the hunt at 7 . : 00 a. m . So , you 're telling us that this thing is on the loose and that you are going to find it ? . Exactly . The only thing that you need to concern yourselves with , gentlemen , is your aim and how you like your snake- - belt , boot or wallet . Well , in that case , gentlemen , ma 'am , to the hunt . To the hunt . [ Sharpe ] The Philadelphia water treatment plant won 't let me go after this python by spraying poisons or chemicals near the water supply . I 'm not about to send armed men blindly down there so they can become snake bait . But with your expertise and boa and your equipment , I believe we can successfully locate and eliminate that python . Using my implants , we can track the boa as it tracks the python and see every move she makes ? . - Exactly . - Let me get this straight . You want to attach that to my boa and use it to hunt down the python that this belongs to ? . That 's the stupidest idea I 've ever heard . Is it ? . The Navy trains seals and dolphins to sweep for mines . The Army uses dogs for security and tactical engagement . It 's a hell of a leap from dogs and dolphins to wild reptiles . It 's not as great a leap as you think . The ClA has been conducting extensive tests on the potential combat and covert ops applications with specimens like yours . Why doesn 't the ClA use its own specimens ? . Their point man on the project was forced to take an unfortunate " leave of absence " during a mission in Russia . The project 's dead . So we 're the best you got , huh ? . Yes . I guess the question now is whether that stuff 's actually going to work . I 've been successfully using the implants on bottle-nosed dolphins for months . With the digital microcam , audio sensors , and GPS monitor in this unit , we can practically monitor your boa 's every move . And I 've called in military reinforcement to back up our operation . Most snakes are territorial , especially the big constrictors . Your point being ? . Take two scorpions , put ' em in a box , they 're both going to want to own that box . They 'll fight till one of them dies . So your boa will attack that python ? . If she picks up the scent , she 'll attack , theoretically . Then what ? . After the boa 's done her job , she 'll be returned to the lab . After she 's been immobilized , of course . - lmmobilized how ? . - That you 'll have to let me look into . We better move . It 's almost dark , and , unlike most snakes , the constrictors are corpuscular . Sorry , I must 've skipped biology class that day . They 're mostly active at dusk and dawn . Your python is already out of the tunnel . Impossible . I 've got three teams working with local authorities , shutting off every inch of pipeline and tunnel in the area . Agent Sharpe , judging by the size of that scale , we 're talking about an 80 to 1 00 foot reticulated python . If it wants out , it 's getting out . [ roaring ] [ roaring continues ] [ rock music on stereo ] [ thumping ] - What was that ? . - What ? . No , I heard something . All right . Touch my car again , and I 'll kick your ass . Yeah . No , no , no , wait . Wait . Relax . Let Lester take over . Who ? . Lester . You know- - You named your dick Lester ? . Well , not me . Actually Candace did . One night we were- - Okay . No . Total mood killer . You know , I liked it better when it was just you and me and Lester . Mmm . [ snarling ] Aaah ! Mmm . Brian , don 't stop . Oh ! [ slurping ] Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Give it to me , Brian . Aaah ! Good . Keep me posted . Tracking 's good . [ Sharpe ] Is that the immobilizer ? . Stun spike . Hit the remote , she gets 80,000 volts . Should knock her out . Can she survive that much voltage ? . Worry about her surviving your equipment . We 're only surgically attaching the contacts and sensor pads . She won 't even know they 're there . I promise . All right . How 's she doing ? . Her heart rate 's not where it should be . Breathing 's shallow . Implanting that equipment took a lot out of her . She lost a lot of blood . Is there anything we can do ? . Just wait and see . Workers at a local water treatment plant just a few miles from here were killed today in what government officials are deeming an " accident . " But it is the opinion of this reporter that there is something more pungent than the fetid smell of stale humidity in the air tonight , and that 's the stench of government half-truths . In a time when lies can cause war and wars create deception , we need something more than ... facts . We need something more than government stories about " accidents . " We need the truth . This is Kent Humphries , Channel 15 Action News . [ clicking button ] Ohhh ... - Wanna take it again ? . - Weren 't you rolling ? . Yes . It 's just that ... I thought you were- - It was a little , you know ... big . A little much . Hard-hitting journalism is always " big . " That 's what real news is , Louis- - sensationalism in its purest state . Well , Kent , I 'm not sure how this " routine " works . I am creating my own signature journalistic style , Louis . Dan Rather has a signature style . Walter Cronkite had a signature style . But this ... makes you look like a schmuck . Really ? . You know something , Louis ? . You are frigging fired . Not again . As of now . You can 't fire me . I can this time . You 've crossed ... the line . [ cell phone beeping ] No reception ? . What the hell do I pay these idiots $ 200 a month for ? . $ 200 ? . Maybe you should get a better plan . You know what ? . I 'm going to keep walking until I find a signal . Then I 'm calling Jack Dauner at the station , and I 'm going to have you fired . Do you understand me ? . I 'm just trying to help you be a better reporter . Your next gig will be cable access , Louis . Besides , Jack hates you much more than I do . [ phone beeping ] Kent Humphries for Jack Dauner , please . Hello ? . [ static , beeps ] Goddamn it ! [ heavy breathing , rustling ] Louis ? . [ snarling ] So , did you finally get a signal ? . - Here you go . - Thanks . So , tell me more about your antivenom . It 's a universal antivenom , hopefully . Most are created to counteract the toxins of a specific species . So , consequently , a large number of victims die needlessly every year , because they can 't help identify the snake that bit them . The situation 's much worse in Africa and South America , regions with large concentrations of poisonous snakes but which lack the financial means to have the antivenoms on hand . Seems like someone would have to have some pretty strong personal reasons to devote their life to such a cause like that . Well , if I can help save one life , it 'd be worth it , right ? . [ rapid beeping ] [ snake moaning ] Metabolics are up . Vitals holding . She 's coming back . [ Sharpe ] Cops just found what was left of a couple of necking teenagers in their car . We also got word about a missing news reporter . You were right . The python got out . How much longer will this take ? . We 're done with the procedure- - Good . Let 's get this show on the road . She 's still recovering . She hasn 't gotten used to the equipment yet . Look , at this point , I 'd settle for her just finding the python . - We 'll take care of the rest . - You mean " kill . " That was pretty much the plan . It 's attitudes like yours that are the reason why people are so scared of snakes . Instead of trying to understand them and study them , they beat them with a stick . I don 't have time to stand here and argue reptile rights with you . In case you haven 't been paying attention , that thing is killing people . How do I know your trigger-happy grunts aren 't going to shoot Betty ? . I 'm running short on options and patience ! If you 've got another solution , I suggest you offer it . Instead of shooting to kill , use this . Megaketamine . It 's an animal tranquilizer . It 'll save the life of the python and my boa . We don 't even have to use the stun spike . I 've got two of these . Two or three doses , they 'll sleep for hours . You were the one that said the ClA was interested in studying giant snakes . I 'd imagine they wouldn 't mind their own guinea pig to play with . All right . We 'll make every effort to capture this thing alive . But if it comes down to a choice between saving human lives and saving that snake , I 'm siding with my own species . Now , this is a beautiful day to hunt and ... kill something . Easy there , good friend . First , let 's check out the scenery . Open it up . All right , driver . Hold for my signal . Quick review . Those tunnels down there go for miles . We could spend the next 12 hours trying to find where that thing went topside . All we can do is deploy your boa and hope it picks up the python ' s trail . Agent Sharpe , you 're going to love this . Trucking company finally gave us a name on those vehicles . Broddick . Founder and sole owner of Broddick Casinos and notorious big game hunter . Notorious , indeed . Lock and load , boys . We 're in python country . [ Sharpe ] Fish and Game department has a file two inches thick on this guy . He sponsors weekend hunting parties for rich gun nuts with nothing better to do than shoot game in controlled conditions . That 's his python down there . That at least answers the question of who 'd be dumb enough to let a giant python out of its cage . Let 's hope two wrongs do make a right . Strike force team stand by until I give the all clear . - Ready to kick some ass , sir . - Outstanding . Open her up ! [ door beeping ] Talk to me , Doc . What 's she doing ? . It 's got to be a reaction to those implants . Elevated cardio and metabolic rates . I never should 've let you talk me into this . Me ? . My equipment is perfectly safe . Your equipment is killing her . There she goes . Microcam and audio plugs are up We 're broadcasting full picture and sound . GPS puts her out about ... 400 feet ahead of us . We can see everything she does . Congratulations , Monica . I couldn 't have done it without the doctor 's help ... and Betty 's . Your equipment is incredible . The equipment- - Audiovisual thermal retrieval unit . Yeah , that . Thanks , Doc . [ Sharpe ] Enough patting each other on the back here . Pack your gear and let 's get ready to track this python . Let 's move out . Clear ! [ tracking device beeping ] Boa 's about a hundred yards ahead of us . Let 's move out . Maintain a minimal distance of 50 yards at all times . Remember , the name of the game here is control and containment . Shoot only if you have to . We want to take this python alive . Seal us in ! She 's moving faster and breaking off to the west . Your boa seems to be doing her job . If the scent 's out there , she 'll find it . Shit ! We just lost the link . Hold up ! I 'm not getting a visual . Where did your snake go , Doc ? . I 'm not sure . She could 've picked up the scent already , unless- - This ... This general area is under where it attacked the teenagers and the reporter . Pythons change their feeding ground after each kill . So if the workers were attacked in the main service tunnel , it may have staked out this adjacent area . How do we know the python will return to these tunnels ? . We don 't . Another hour , the sun 's going to be pretty strong out there . It 'll seek out the coolest place possible . Let 's just hope when it does , it comes back down here . Yeah . [ typing , beeping ] Keep your eyes peeled . Okay , we 'll split up here . Dad ? . Dad . Dad ! I told you to do that back at the plane . Or you 'll have to wear a catheter like your old man . This ain 't one of your dumb-ass video games . Make sure you wait until you get a kill shot . Yeah , I 'll remember . Oh . God , I hate you . You travel light . I don 't believe in wasting bullets . One ? . I never needed more . I did a Google search on pythons last night . Apparently , when they squeeze you , they can feel your heart beat . The faster your heart beats , the tighter they squeeze you . Just remember what I told you . Show no fear . [ birds squawking ] Broddick , hold up . We 've got movement back here . Stay put . We 'll circle back and flank you . Eve , what 's your position ? . We 're on your left , babe . I 've got you . Possible sighting behind us . Push ahead of me 50 yards . Stagger the line . Wait for my signal . Copy that . Let 's do it . There it is , boy ! Go get it ! What are we waiting for ? . Broddick 's signal . Oh . Guy like that has it all- - his own casinos , a tasty biscuit like her , and now first shot at killing that snake . And we 're just going to sit back and let him take it . Fuck that . Damn it . Okay , AV link 's back . Finally . Let 's move out . Move out . [ Emmett ] Where is she ? . I can 't tell . Damn it ! I lost the signal again . Shouldn 't we wait for them ? . And stay here all day till Blondie gets her Game Boy to work right ? . Let 's find this thing , tag it , bag it and get the hell out of here . These retaining walls are between us and the boa , but it 's not on the GPS . They 're disrupting the signal . Has anyone seen our soldiers ? . Broddick , we have a problem . Foley just went AWOL . Tex took off after him . Amateurs . Foley ! Foley ! Fuck . Foley , come back ! Aaaah ! What happened ? . Mr. Foley , what happened ? . Where is Tex ? . I don 't know . When I got back , he was gone . I have two very simple rules here on this hunt . Number one .. Never leave your team . Number two .. Stay the fuck away from my girlfriend . Who 's firing ? . My boy 's got him on the run ! [ yelling ] Shoot to kill , boy , not to wound ! Let him have it ! I 've been waiting 1 5 years to use this ! Fire in the hole ! Cease fire ! Cease fire ! Congratulations , James . I 'm sure this will look wonderful stuffed and mounted on the wall of your father 's den . - lt 'll look great above the fireplace . - Shut up . Now that we 've completely lost our tactical edge- - [ rustling ] Whoa ! It 's just me , boys . I think I found where our snake went . If I were a disgusting 80-foot reptile , those tunnels are exactly the kind of place I 'd go to wait out the sun and find a drink . Then that 's where we 're going . Tunnel maps are in the van . Let 's fall back and reload for round two . Dad ! [ Sharpe ] Repeat : Halt current position . Please respond . Interference must be messing with the radio frequency . That or those jar heads decided to play hero and ignore me . AV signal 's back . Betty 's really on the move . She must be hunting something down . Work , you $ 10 million piece of- - Wait . GPS is picking up two more signals , both inside the plant perimeter . One 's moving faster than the other . She found the python . Unless she found your soldiers . Soldiers , read me ! Repeat ! We 've lost contact ! So , Rock , Paper , Scissors ? . [ distant hissing ] I don 't see anything . I sure in hell hear it . [ distant hissing ] Now where ? . Uh , uh ... - Which way did they go , Monica ? . - I don 't know . It 's scrambled . - Get that stun spike ready . - AV 's back . Oh , God . Betty 's right on top of them . Light her up , Doc . This is a one-shot deal . I spike her now , she 's out for hours , if she survives the voltage . - Excuse me ? . - [ banging ] [ screams ] [ Monica ] Now left . No , right ! Where the hell are we going ? . [ snake roaring ] [ gunfire ] Look ! They 're sitting ducks in there . - Emmett , pull the trigger ! - Shoot the pipes . What ? . [ screeching ] [ screeching continues ] [ yells ] [ screaming ] Give me your radio . Soldiers , listen to me . Constrictors use heat to see . They rely on thermal differences . Shoot the pipes . A burst of heat or cold can disrupt their vision- - - Shoot the pipes ? . - Shoot the pipes ! Use the heat and the steam for cover . [ soldier ] We 're clear , but we lost Hoffman and Montgomery . Copy that . The two of you continue until you reach the surface exit . [ sighs ] I gotta hand it to you , Doc . That was some quick thinking under pressure . You saved two men 's lives ... and our spike . Let 's keep moving . Damn it . Mmm . You having fun yet ? . I 'd be having more fun if we could ditch the weekend warriors . - This damn thing is stickin ' . - Here . Use mine . What are you gonna use ? . I think it 's time to turn up the heat a little . Ooh ! We got one hour of daylight left , if we 're lucky . Hot enough for you ? . No . Why don 't you do me a favor and kick it up a few notches , pops ? . You boys like your meat extra crispy ? . - Got to get me one of those . - Oh , man ! Whoa . No , no , no . - May I ask you a question ? . - Sure . Why dolphins ? . - Why do I work with them , you mean ? . - Uh-huh . Well , they 're intelligent , social . They interact well with humans . Guess it makes it a little easier to get to know ' em . So , what about you ? . Why snakes ? . Well , they 're intelligent . They 're , uh , pretty independent . Occasionally known to have bad tempers , and not particularly social . They keep their distance- - from humans especially . [ chuckles ] You all right ? . Yeah . Just a little pissed . Want to take five ? . Good plan . Truth is , if you really want to know , I lost someone very close to a snakebite . When I was six , I traveled with my family through South America . We were staying in this village outside of Buenos Aires . One night , my little sister goes to get a drink of water , steps on a pit viper that was curled up under the bathroom sink . The village doctor couldn 't figure out which antivenom to administer . By the time my dad did the 15-mile drive to the nearest hospital , she was already- - Oh , I 'm sorry . I guess I figured that , working on the antivenom , I 'd learn something about them . - How 's that working out for you ? . - I don 't know . For starters , I 've learned that I gotta get out of the lab more often . [ Sharpe ] I hate to interrupt getting-to-know-you time , but could we keep moving ? . Betty 's sitting tight , [ tracker beeping ] but there 's another signal moving toward her . It must be the python . What 's the location ? . I don 't know . I think she 's in some sort of service tunnel or- - Diversion tunnel . Look . She 's in one of these two passages located underneath the main pipe tunnel . - They 're connected by this link . - Part of some overflow system . - If we could seal off that level- - - Both snakes would be contained . But who 's going to volunteer to be trapped in those tunnels while trying to locate and sedate two super-sized reptiles ? . We don 't have to send anybody in . We flush them out . How ? . We flood the system . We force them to go where we want them to go . The sublevels both drain into this underground reservoir here . Your men could go in and bat cleanup with tranquilizers . All right . Kosnetova , you there ? . Listen up . I need sublevel diversion tunnels 1 and 2 sealed off immediately and all teams mobilized to the reservoir junction 27B in preparation for target recovery . I need it all yesterday . We don 't have a second to spare . Copy ? . I 'm on it . Out . Boys and girls , time to move . Let 's trap this rat . We 've got AV back . It 's weak , but it 's- - - Damn ! - What ? . - I don 't think you want to see this . - What is it ? . Looks like the python 's trying to get busy with your boa . [ growling ] She 's the only species of boa that lays eggs . I 've tried to get her to mate , unsuccessfully . Nothing 's worked . It looks like she 's putting up one hell of a fight now . - Ew , is that his- - - Vestigial hind leg . The male python uses them like spurs during mating . Oh , that . [ snakes growling ] I 'll go check it out . Mr. Danner , you and James go with him . Maintain radio contact at all times . Oh , and , Mr. Danner , you 're in charge . [ Monica ] Looks like the boa 's on the run . Damn it . We need her to keep that python interested long enough for that sublevel to be sealed off . He 's still interested . The python 's following her . I can 't believe I 'm condoning the use of my snake in laying a man-trap . We 've got company . GPS is picking up three more signals in tunnel 2 . Kosnetova , come in . We 're getting multiple signals in the tunnels . You send somebody down here ? . Kosnetova , do you copy ? . Whoever it is , we gotta get them out . In three minutes , that tunnel 's going to be filled with several thousand gallons of water . Then there 's still time . Stand back , boy . I 'm in charge . [ groans ] Anyone else get the feeling that we 're completely lost ? . Give it a rest . [ growling ] [ pipes creaking , water running ] Where ? . [ alarm blaring ] - Here , here ! - I got this . [ alarm blaring ] You know , that can 't be good . Someone 's coming . Or something . One shot , one kill . Nothing more , nothing less . Good night , [ whispers ] my love . [ Monica screams ] [ coughs ] [ Monica sobbing ] Outstanding . Sharpe ! Sharpe ! Holy shit , Foley . Whoops . - He 's dead . - Who the hell are you people ? . - Which one of you is Broddick ? . - He 's upstairs . He 's in charge . Save it . [ snake growling ] [ yelling ] [ growling ] You got a gun in your hand , you idiot ! Use it ! Dad ! [ yelling ] That 's right . Open wide , you son of a bitch ! We 've got to get out of here . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! [ yelling ] [ steam hissing ] Hold up . Give me some more light over here . Baby , look at this . I 'd say your snake didn 't come here to drink . She came here to nest . Yeah ? . Well , there 's only one problem . The snake I ordered wasn 't female . [ hissing ] - These must be the water tanks . - There 's dozens of rooms like this . - Shit ! - What is it ? . I forgot the bag and the monitor and- - [ snake growling ] Doesn 't matter . Let 's go ! There 's no way out of here ! - You know how to swim , don 't you ? . - What ? . Wait ! Oh , shit ! [ Broddick ] Okay , baby . Let 's put the egg back where we found it , shall we ? . [ hissing , growling ] Aah ! Eve ! Eve ! [ grunting ] [ yelling ] [ clicking ] [ snake growling ] Stay with me , baby . Be right there . [ moaning ] [ gasping ] [ no audible dialogue ] I 'll get her for you . [ coughing ] That- - That was amazing . You should see me do it out of the water sometime . - I 'll be right back . - Where- - There 's a grate about 60 feet that way . - I think it leads to a different room . - Let 's go for a swim . Okay . Where 's the hell 's the cavalry ? . Well , I 'd say we either go after the python and your boa without any radio or tracking support or we call it a day and get the fuck out of here . Your call , Doc . - Who the hell are you ? . - I was about to ask you the same question . Broddick . - Have we met ? . - Nope . Asshole ! Do you have any idea what you 've done ? . Whatever it is , I 'm sure it 's nothing compared to what I 'm about to do to you if you don 't get the fuck out of my way ! Let him go . I said , let him go . Mr. Broddick , you 're under arrest for poaching and illegal animal importing . Take him away . You all right ? . Then let 's go . Come on . [ snake snarling ] We went to 27B . Nobody was home . - We 've been following you ever since . - Sharpe 's dead . We know . We found his body in the reservoir . You didn 't happen to find the AV monitor down there too , did you ? . No . But we 've got your laptop equipment up and running at our camp in Philadelphia . We 'll be there in 10 minutes . Asshole . [ laughing , shouting ] It 's not a toy , huh ? . [ beeping ] And we 're back in business . Well , sort of . I 've got GPS and audio . Visual 's basically a bust . Implants must be damaged . - Location ? . - About four blocks east of us . What 's it doing all the way over there ? . - Probably checking on her brood . - What are you talking about ? . Oh , don 't you know ? . We stumbled into her nest . Broke one of her eggs accidentally . That 's why that bitch reptile killed my girl . - Can you play it back on the video feed ? . - Sure . Give me a sec . I got it . [ whirring ] Okay , slower . Stop . There . Now zoom in . The only species of a boa to lay eggs ? . There 's no way he could impregnate her and then she lay eggs within an hour . No . She must have already been pregnant . That 's why she was fighting off the python . She was defending her nest . Either that , or she 's just got good taste in men . Oh , no . Why is she letting him eat her eggs ? . What 's wrong with her ? . She must be too injured to fight . When was this recorded ? . Fifteen , 20 minutes ago . Look . - At least we know she 's all right . - And she 's after the python . Your snake has a sense of vengeance ? . That 's what we 're about to find out . I wonder if you officially made her shit list , Broddick . Mclntyre . Well , just don 't stand there ! - Stop ! Stop ! - Fuck off . [ whooping ] I should 've known she was pregnant . It must 've been a combination of the food snakes and the growth hormone . Or maybe it was just nature 's way of letting you know you 're doing all right . [ rhythmic beating ] - What is that ? . - Whatever it is , it 's live . - Sounds like machinery . - It 's music . I thought you secured a five-mile perimeter . [ heavy drumbeats ] [ techno ] See you on the other side of here . [ screaming ] [ snake slurping ] Watch it ! [ woman screams ] Oh , my God ! [ shouting , screaming ] [ shouting continues ] Everybody move forward . [ screaming , shouting ] [ growling ] [ together ] Oh , shit ! [ shouting , screaming ] [ screaming , shouting ] Die , you slithering piece of shit ! Welcome to my barbecue . [ screams ] No ! [ yelling ] [ soldiers yelling , groaning ] We have a madman loose with a flamethrower . I need more men ASAP . [ growling ] Monica ! Fucking thing ! Here 's the plan : Run ! - Good plan . - We 're in trouble . The gun 's out there . [ screaming ] [ grunting ] [ hissing , screeching ] [ growling ] Hello , bitch . Remember me ? . [ yelling ] [ screaming ] [ grunting ] [ snakes snarling ] [ grunting ] [ spits ] I hope you fucking choke on me , bitch ! [ yelling ] Okay , come on . [ horn blowing ] Whoa ! [ screaming ] It 's too late . Sorry , Betty . [ screams ] [ horn blowing ] I killed her . No , you saved her life . She 's gone . So , what if we can 't find her ? . We know where her nest is . We 'll find her . - What ? . - You and me . We make a pretty good team . And Betty makes three . - Ready ? . - Ready . Subtitled by J. R. Media Services , lnc . Burbank - CA

 This has got to be a first . We 're rich ... you 're miserable . A fleeting taste of wealth is worse than a lifetime of poverty . Slaves from the Caton Mines are sold in lots of 10 , 000 ! To free D 'Argo 's son , we 'll have to pay for them all ! There 'll be nothing left for us ! Oh , there 'll be some ... enough to indulge ourselves a little . See ... I 'm gonna get some Bennigan Fire Silk ... .It 's for my bed . Everytime I think that there 's more to you than a pair of pushed up loomers in a corset you disappoint me ! From you ? I 'll take that as a compliment . Last time I saw my son , was the night my wife was murdered . I sent him away to be safe , and .. he ends up a slave . And if you hadn 't , he 'd be dead by now , D 'Argo . Peacekeepers despise half - breeds . All those vital cycles growing up without me there ... I almost hope he doesn 't remember me . All he 'll care about is that you came back for him . D 'Argo , we are now within range of the Caton Mines . If you wish to contact the slavers - - now is the time . I would like to bid on Lot Keshu Four . Apologies . Lot Keshu Four , unavailable . What ? Why not ? Sold . No , that 's not possible . That can 't be . We 've missed the slave auction . You 're information was wrong ! I wasn 't wrong ! I wasn 't ! My people are in that lot as well . Lot Keshu Four , special sale , private buyer , triple price . But other slaves , available . I do not want other slaves ! Who purchased that lot ? Tell me ! as recordings are so .. sadly impersonal .. I 'll have to imagine what your face looks like now . Etched with failure , I expect . I have Ka D 'Argo 's son . Surrender to me , or the boy dies . How .. H - How did Scorpius find out about Jothee ? Stark , you said you didn 't tell anyone about the auction . No , I didn 't . The data was stored only on my console . I mean , Scorpius did try to trace the datalink - - during the break - in , but I stopped .. him . I mean , uh , I .. think I stopped .. Oh , God . We led him straight to Jothee . Stark ... Jothee wasn 't the only slave in that auction lot ! Thousands of Baniks ! My - My own people ! They belong to Scorpius now too ! You think I wanted that ? I didn 't .. This is all your fault ! We got your money . We saved your ass ! Only when you had no other choice ! If you had helped me from the beginning , we would 've been out of here before Scorpius had even arrived ! I can 't lose Jothee , not again .. not like this . Not like this . Frell ! You 're pathetic ! You keep talking about how much I mean to you . How you 'd do anything to get me back . But when it comes down to it , you fail me .. again ! Like you always do ! I did everything I could . Liar ! You know what you have to do . I can 't . No . You won 't . Who means more to you ? D 'Argo ? Hey . I heard what happened . You don 't understand . I , ah ... I was prepared to give Scorpius what he wanted . What ? On the Command .. for a microt .. I was ready to take Crichton by force and deliver him to Scorpius . It was all I could do to stop myself . Crichton is your friend ... Jothee is my blood . He 's my child . all I have left of my wife .. Now , why .. is that not enough ? I do not care for the others . All I need is the Luxan 's son . The Banik Slavers can keep the rest . I explained that to them sir , but the Catons have refused to search through 10 . 000 slaves to locate one . The freighter that we hired is being loaded right now . Natira did spend a great deal to acquire them . We could accept the surplus and resell them individually to recoup our losses . ... you mean ... your losses ! A poor choice of words . I hardly consider it a loss . Just a small price to keep you happy , and .. settle our account . You consider things settled now , do you ? Ah- - Scorpius accept your victory . I haven 't got Crichton yet ! Tell me ... were there any Stykera amongst the other Banik slaves ? Not ... according to the manifest . Well , that 's a pity . I could have used a replacement for the one that escaped my Gammak base . Dispatch a Maurauder .. to the freighter , and have the Luxan 's son returned here at maximum speed . Sir ! You can keep the other slaves . Do with them as you will . Metal fatigue ? - - How serious is it , Pilot ? The DRDs found only a few occurrences on this tier . It seems to have been caused by some kind of corrosive that I can neither identify nor account for . All right , I see it Pilot . If the DRDs can take a sample , then Zhaan can analyze it . I would appreciate it . How 's D 'Argo ? Not good . He blames me for losing Jothee - - could be right . So , I 've come up with a plan . Oh , there 's a surprise . The slaver said that Jothee 's lot shipped out on a freighter . Right . Even if we can find it , we could never intercept it . Aeryn , no- - the point is , is that Jothee 's still in transit . He won 't get to the depository for a couple of solar days . How can you be sure he 's going to the depository ? I know .. how Scorpy thinks . He doesn 't have Jothee . Which means we still have time . We can beat him . Forever the optimist . Yeah , well . It 's a common human trait in humans with a death wish . All right , here 's the deal Help from who ? Since entering the Uncharted Territories , Moya and I have been mapping our movements as best we can . We 've identified several locations where we might obtain assistance . Item one The Vocarions . They 're the ones who tortured me . Tell us ... where are they ? Yeah , but they 'll be able to find Jothee no matter where Scorpius stashes him . Item two On the ground . Now ! They 're not fighters - - They 're scavengers and cowards . Yeah ... who can breathe fire that burns through metal like Kleenex . Three " Tavlek " Remain where you are ! They 're nothing but barbarian extortionists . Their gauntlet weapons are awesome in close combat . And finally , we need the Zenetan Pirates . There 's something pulling us in ! That 's impossible ! We 're caught in The Flax . The Flax Net . 'Flax ' what ? An electrostatic scan . It instantly disables ships . And what makes you think all these 'Zeltecs ' are gonna help us ? Cash . These guys are mercenaries . They want money , we got plenty . We get them , we go in hot . We kill Scorpius , and we bring your son back . Stark ! What 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? ... gone ... dead . All dead . All dead . I failed them . What are you talking about ? The Baniks ... they 're gone . He 's a Stykari . He 's ... he 's attuned to the dying . He knows . Scorpius killed the slaves ? Yes . Jothee is among them . Jothee 's not dead .. Scorpius did not allow that to happen . You have to trust me on this . We can get your son back . And we can kill that cadaverous son of a bitch , but we have to do it now . Zhaan , we 've got one solar day - - two , tops . If I 'm not back by then , tell Scorpius where I went . He 'll trade that for Jothee . Understood , John . May the Goddess be with you all . " You 're almost there , John . You 're almost there ... " Okay , Leatherface . Your turn . You never cease to amaze me , John . Man , that 's'Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' ! That 's a classic ! You weren 't supposed to be able to initiate a conversation with this neural clone . Yeah , kind of sucks having someone inside your head . Doesn 't it ? No matter . The task is almost complete . It wasn 't easy . There are vast areas of your brain that are filled with nothing but .. gibberish . That would be High School . Like it or not , Scorpy .. I know how you think . We 're sharing now .. and that 's how I 'm going to beat you . Perhaps you only believe that , because that is what we want you to think . Sir , the Luxan 's son is returning on your Maurauder , but due to delays identifying him on the freighter .. Don 't give me excuses ! Do you think Crichton is simply going to surrender himself to me ? I will not give him one microt more than is necessary to formulate his plan . Is that clear ? Sir . I 'll inform you the moment the boy arrives . Calm down you 'll have an accident . My coolant system has advanced considerably . .. since the original surgery . Mmm . Not enough to prevent this 'Crichton ' from almost killing you . Why do you want him so badly ? He destroyed my Gammak base . Revenge ? He 's not a Scarran . You wouldn 't waste your hatred on anything else . This is why I can 't have you around . You know me too well . Without me , you 'd still be the same angry hotheaded young creature I took in so many cycles ago . Without me .. your head .. among other things , would be a trophy on the wall at Peacekeeper Command . See . We were made for each other . Oh . Checking on our treasure ? Or are you helping yourself ? The way I see it ? Beating you to it . How dare you ! I ... hmm . 50 - 50 ? All right . But just enough so no one notices . Yeah . It 's always nice to have a little something tucked away when all hezmana breaks loose . Empty . What the frell ! It 's gone ! Someone 's beaten us to it ! But who ? Crichton 's too ... ' honorable ' . Well , Aeryn 's too dull . D 'Argo 's too ... ah ... Say it . Simple ? Well , yeah , but he 's not a thief . Someone is . We 've been robbed . Did you hear that ? It sounded like ... tearing metal . Ryge ? Get down here ! I trust you 're well ? I asked you ... for help ! What the yotz were those creatures ? They looked like ... They looked like our money ! Our money 's alive ! You realize what the means . They 're eating the ship ! Yes but we 're poor . Howdy Bekhesh . Meet Wynona . Lights go out . Gauntlet comes off . Freeze ! Unless it 's already off . I told you . I no longer wear the gauntlet . I 'm not a creature of violence any more . That 's good . I don 't believe you . I don 't care . A lifetime of killing and extortion takes it 's toll . Yeah , especially on those you kill and extort . Yes . But also on myself , during a hostage raid we captured a Priest . A Disciple of the Writ of Turu , he refused to eat or sleep . All he would do , day and night , was preach , whether anyone was listening or not . I executed him . But I kept his writ . I don 't know why . One day I started reading , and .. they were words of peace , but they made me feel .. better . Then one day , I took off my gauntlet and I threw it away ! I still don 't believe you . Well then kill me . Or let me go ! I need your gauntlet . No ! It 's a tool of destruction ! That 's why I want it . Well ? How bad is it ? Are we in danger of a hull breach ? Of course we are . Those creatures eat metal . Zhaan , they 're devouring Moya 's sense filaments . She 's trying to endure the pain , but it 's growing . Brave Moya . Can 't you flush them out ... or ... or suffocate them ? I trapped several creatures in a bulkhead and opened it to space , but they were too firmly entrenched to expel . And the vacumn didn 't affect them at all . Well , do something ! I can 't do any more until I have a specimen to study . Chiana is trying to capture one now . Now , if you can 't make yourself useful , Rygel , I suggest you leave ! Frell ! This is your last warning shot ! This is your fault ! My fault ? This is your fault ! You were on the inside . You stole the wrong container ! With the device you gave me . I did precisely what I was supposed to . I was heroic ! Shut up , both of you ! The fault lies with all of us . We brought those creatures aboard . Moya is suffering because of us . Now little fella ! Zhaan ? Zhaan , I think I got one ! Thank Ka 'halaan . Bring it here immediately . Ah ... soon as I can . Attention Sheyang vessel . This is not a hostile approach . I come with an opportunity for profit . Please respond . So . You 've come to finish me . Who attacked you ? It was swift . Unprovoked . And where 's the rest of your crew ? Abandoned ship in evacuation pods . As leader I stayed behind to guard their escape . That 's very noble of you . You said you had an opportunity for profit . Spare my female . Please ! She bears my children . Down ! Come with me . So , you 're going to attack a Shadow Depository . That 's the plan . Very well . I will help you . You can barely help yourself . Look at you . You 're weak . You 're all used up . And you 're no use to me . No use ? I 've seen bigger . I can do better . You 'll have to . You know .. pretty soon you 're gonna start jones 'n for that gauntlet really bad . I 'm not leaving here without it . Bekhesh ? I got all the time in the world . A Luxan - Sebacean hybrid ? Despite Peacekeeper Command efforts to keep the bloodlines pure , there seems to be a few more of them every cycle . Have you got something against hybrids ? Hmm ? No , of course not . Not at all . Ka Jothee , is it ? What the frell are you ? Some kind of mutant ? His mother was a Sebacean . She was raped by a Scarran . Did the Luxan rape your mother too ? No . Your father abandoned you to a life of slavery . Is it his lineage you hate the most ? My mother was murdered by her brother . Does that answer your question ? So you ... hate Luxans and Sebaceans - - equally . How very interesting . You bought 10 , 000 slaves , just to get me ? What do you want ? From you , nothing . But your father- - would give me something I want very much . Pray to your Luxan mystics .. that he loves you still . Why are the Peacekeeper 's Termination Squad after you ? We were hired to find some of their deserters . But , once we discovered my mate was with child .. we decided to discontinue the hunt . And you kept the payment . Well ... only half . We did half the work ! You are a good torturer . Are you as good at tracking ? Show him . It would be easy to overlook the scent of Hynerian and Delvian beneath the musk of Nebari on you . Will you help me ? Yes ! You saved our lives . We are obligated . I will not desert you ! The Peacekeeper hunters are dead . There are caves nearby . I will be safe there to give birth . Our children will live . Because of him . If we can help restore his child , we must ! we could use the currency . Oh ! The heat 's not affecting it at all ! You said they ran from your blowtorch ! I said , " maybe " they did . I 'll increase the heat . Oh no . What 's wrong ? It 's dead . It took too much heat to kill it , Chiana . Moya could never raise her interal temperature that high . Evil . There are over 2 , 000 of those creatures on board . We could never kill them one by one like this . I must find a way to deal with the total infestation . Zhaan , it 's Scorpius . He wants to talk to D 'Argo . He 's found us ! We 're dead . I will speak to him , Pilot . Where 's Ka D 'Argo ? Where 's Crichton ? They have no reason to trust you . You tried to sabotage our ship . Why would you honor any exchange ? Sabotage ? Don 't play stupid you butcher . Your metal eating money ... I will speak to Crichton and D 'Argo now . Speak to me . Your favorite food for the Aurora Chair . You murdered my people , Scorpius . Thousands of Baniks as if they were nothing . And all for one boy - - well go ahead and kill Jothee if you want , because he means nothing to me ! You 're not getting Crichton ! What the frell were you thinking ? You just condemned D 'Argo 's son to death ! Look ... Scorpius thinks I 'm mad ... he - he won 't blame you ... he - he needs Jothee . He won 't kill him . I - I know Scorpius . I do . We can 't let him know that Moya 's in trouble . He 'll come after us . And if he smells advantage , to him it 's the scent of victory . If Jothee dies , I will not wait for D 'Argo . I will kill you myself ! Pilot ? What 's happening ? Energy failure ! Tiers 5 through 9 . The creatures have infiltrated the power conduits . So ? Do something about it . Use the DRDs , that 's what they 're for ! I 've tried ! They 're eating the DRDs as well . How long before they break through the hull , Pilot ? I don 't know . But unless we destroy them soon , the internal damage may be irreparable . Moya may die . Well ... that brings back memories . Does it hurt as much as it used to ? The sensation is , ah ... well , more complicated than pain . You 're much more patient than I remember . Why aren 't you hunting down the thieves on the Leviathan ? Well , that would be a waste of effort . Crichton ... will come to me . How 's your nurse ? Recovering . At any event , the currency that was stolen belongs to you- - yet , you seem strangely unaffected for the loss . Tell me , what did you really put in my storage containers ? Karack Metalites . While dormant , they look like Borinium ingots . But they 're actually burrowing creatures . They consume metal in their natural environment . And you intended to destroy my Marauder . Kill my crew , killing ... me . Yes . You wouldn 't have respected me otherwise . How commendable . Very fortunate I was robbed . Now tell me Eventually . For a vessel that size , it should take at least eight solar days . Rest assured . The Leviathan is dead . Hey Bekhesh , buddy . How ya feelin ' ? You 're lookin ' kinda crappy , you know - that gauntlet would fix you right up . Where is it ? I can 't tell you . The Writ of Turu says allowing another to inflict harm is an act of violence itself . I 'm trying to make up for the things I 've done ! You want to end violence ? You want to serve peace ? Then help me ! Help yourself . Where 's the gauntlet ? Please ! Let me go ! I need to have it ! Hey ! That 's mine ! Put that on , it 'll kill you . You forget ... I 've worn a gauntlet before . Remember ? That was over a cycle ago . I 've tripled the dose since then . All right then , put it on , and I 'll strip it from your corpse in three arns . You want the gauntlet - you take me with it . Why should I trust you ? You said there was currency in it for me - lots of it . What about your great reformation ? It 's easier to reform when you 're rich . You 're feeling Moya 's pain ... What I feel ... Moya feels a thousand times worse . Pilot , I think I 've found a solution . I want to flood Moya 's affected areas with adrexan vapor . After she has absorbed it into her body , you ... you 'll be able to ignite it electrically . Ignite ? Waves of heat will course through her body , then flames . The creatures will be destroyed . You 'd burn Moya ? To save her . No ! There must be another way ! I haven 't given up hope of trying to fine one . And I won 't ! But if we run out of time , Pilot ... you must believe me . This may be Moya 's last hope . The Builders put our fates in your care , Zhaan . Whatever you decide , we will abide by it . Now that we have reached Zenetan territory , I have a task to perform . And while it pains me to leave you at such a critical juncture , I will not shirk my duty . The Zenetan Pirates await . Good luck , and farewell ! You always know when to run . That 's cold ! Be careful , child . Adrexan vapor is highly volatile . Sorry . Are we really going to burn Moya ? Do you think I want it to come to this ? Zhaan , the canisters in Maintenance Bay Four are ready . Thanks . Pilot , have you sealed all the affected areas ? Yes . It 's almost one - ninth of Moya 's total body . Release the vapor . It 's done . The vapor will be fully absorbed in less than nine arns . Good . That gives me enough time . I am Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth , requesting an audience . Most beings do not seek out the Zenetan Pirates . I have a business proposition regarding your Flax Net . I will speak with Commander Kcrackic . Kcrackic no longer commands here . Nor is he , in fact , alive . I now control The Flax . Welcome back , Rygel . So your , ah ... Flax Net will simply be used to ensure our escape . There is little risk and , uh , great reward for your participation . An interesting proposal . When the ship you abandoned me in was snared in the Zenetan 's net . They were little more than a gang of petty cutthroats . Under my direction , I have turned them , and The Flax , into a tool for power and profit . Is that a " yes " ... or a " no " ? We had a truce ! When I am finished with you ... Dominar ... death himself will pray for you ! Hmm . I thought you might say something like that . I liked your proposal . Zhaan , what are you waiting for ? The vapor was absorbed an arn ago ! There must be another way , Chiana . perhaps a crystal resonator . We can shatter them with sound ! The creatures are nearing Moya 's propulsors , Zhaan . If the creatures consume those systems , we 'll be dead in space , there 's no more time ! On our way , Pilot . Pilot , I will take as much of your 's and Moya 's pain as I can ... No ! It will overwhelm you ! I will take that chance . I will stay by your side . Zhaan . You have to do it now . Ka 'halaan help us . Pilot , ignite the vapor . Uh ! Don 't touch that . You know , flossing could help you with that gingivitis . Pilot ? What the hell 's going on over there ? Pilot ? You guys okay ? Pilot ! I 'm seeing flames on Moya ! It 's all right , Crichton . Stark , there are flames on Moya ! That is not all right ! John , we started the fire on purpose . What ? We had to ... just come aboard . I 'll explain it to you . Chiana , just tell me Yeah ... I think so . Everyone , but Moya . Moya 's in so much pain , she can 't even starburst . Will she heal ? Pilot 's not sure . Our money did this ? We did this ... and since we have nothing to pay the mercenaries ... do you think they are going to want to help us ? Scorpius is going to kill Jothee ... No he won 't . Hey ! Hey , frek face ! Hey , you ! Stop that ridiculous mumbling ! Uh , uh , you 're not here to fight each other . The Tavleks raided our village . That is why I asked your forgiveness . Well , so - Tavleks are treacherous scum ! Criminals ! So 's everybody on this ship ! You are being paid to work together ! That 's right and that 's what we do to people who don 't . Good work , Ryge . You 're here to do a job . Start acting like professionals ... Where would Crichton have gone at a time like this ? I don 't know , but he hasn 't exactly been himself lately . Well , I want him confined to his quarters ! I 'll see to it , but you know , he 's been trying to help you . Always just too late . Father ? Jothee . Jothee ! It 's you , it 's really you ! Father ! You 're choking me . Everything you 've been through , so many cycles ... I 'm sorry Not your fault . I never stopped thinking about you ... trying to find you ... I almost lost hope . I didn 't . I knew you would come for me . My son . My son ! How did you escape Scorpius ? He let me go . he what ? W - why ? Hello , John . You want the wormhole technology ... I want your implant out of my head . ... So , finally , the rift between us is not so great . You do what you got to do . You win . As if there was ever any doubt .

 I hate myjob on days like this , Jeb . If it were my choice ... I 'd be giving you a promotion . But with the economy the way it is ... - Are you firing me ? - You can hold your head up , Jeb . - You 've done a good job here . - I ... don 't believe this . I thought this was just an evaluation . I 'm sorry . I really am . ( police siren ) ( police officer ) Be calm . Stay back . Everybody , stay back . Just get back . ( woman ) Oh , my God , there 's someone in there ! ( growls ) ( officer ) Stay back ! Keep your distance ! Jeb . Can I help you ? Jeb ! Hey . Jeb . What 's up ? ( gunshot ) - Agent Reyes ? - Hi . - Monica Reyes . - Frank Potter , New Orleans PD . Trying to quit the habit . Yeah , I tried to quit smoking myself once . I hated that damn gum . Anyway , you wanna see the victims ? You said you believed the killings might be satanic ritual murders . Right . Let me show you . This is Jeb Dukes ' work area . I found this among his personal effects . What can you tell me about the killer , Detective ? 31 years old , college grad , lived alone . There 's some who felt he had a dark side , which could explain that there . Can I look in there ? Sure . You 're the expert . Does it tell you anything about why he killed them ? A killer like this is usually pushed over the edge by a " stressor " : a catalysing event , an emotional breakdown , the break-up of a relationship , or sometimes when someone 's been fired . This guy was fired - by the two victims . Well , that 's most likely what drove him to murder . Yeah , but what about all these images , these devil pictures ? It 's Marilyn Manson . - Marilyn Manson ? - Your kids listen to him . They probably buy his CDs at Kmart . I don 't think there 's anything satanic going on here , Detective . Agent Reyes . OK . OK , it 's some rock group . You don 't think this has anything to do with Satan ? Personally ? I 'd look into his gum . ( Potter ) Agent Reyes ? Did you find something ? ( knocking ) - Mulder ! - What ? I was about to jump in the shower , but I was waiting for the pizza man . You got something going on with the pizza man ? The pizza man ? You said you were waiting for the pizza man to jump in the shower . No , what I mean was , the pizza man 's usually late , and so ... - You wanna come in ? - Thank you . I feel like I 'm in an episode of Mad About You . Well , yeah , but small technicality : Mad About You was about a married couple , and we just work together . You know what I 'm talking about . I do , I do . What I 'm trying to say is that ... we have no reliable information on this man . I am saying the pizza man ... is not above suspicion . Ah , I see . - Is that for me ? - Yeah . Nice package . What 's the occasion ? Oh , I was going through some stuff after my mother died . It 's just an old family keepsake , and I wanted you to have it . - Well , I 'm touched . - ( knock at door ) Little Caesars , I presume ? Hi . Just give it to the man with the funny look on his face . - Yeah , it 's $ 29.08 . - $ 29.08 ? What 'd she get on it , a tank of gas ? ( Scully gasps ) Scully ? Scullyl Call 911 . That Scully ? Dana ? - She 's got abdominal pains ? - Her doctor is Dr Speake . - He 's been called . - She . - Who are you ? The husband ? - No . Then you wait outside . - Agent Mulder , what happened ? - How 'd you find out ? I was dropping something off . Her landlord told me . - Are you the husband ? - Me ? No . - ( phone rings ) - Excuse me . - Mulder . - Special Agent Fox Mulder ? Speaking . My name is Monica Reyes . We 've never met . Not since you 've been alive , I should say . - Who ? - Special Agent Reyes . I know this is out of the blue , but I have a case I need your help on . It involves a certain phenomenon . I can 't help you for so many reasons . You should contact Agent Doggett at the X-Files . I can 't call Agent Doggett because it involves him . I 'm in New Orleans , but I can be in DC in a few hours . It 's important , Agent Mulder . Very . Call me when you get here . They 're telling us not to worry . They 're running some tests . - Agent Mulder . - Agent Reyes ? You 're taller than I thought . You keep alluding to a time that we 've met . I don 't remember . I was there when they found you in the woods . You were ... Yeah , I 'm not surprised you don 't remember . I have somewhere I have to be , if we could cut to the chase . As I said before , it involves Agent Doggett . The death of his son . I don 't know if you 're familiar with that case . No , I 'm not at all familiar with Agent Doggett . I wasn 't aware of this . You were the lead investigator ? Once it fell to the FBI . Agent Doggett was with the NYPD at the time . We worked it together . We never caught the killer . It was the hardest case I 've ever had . As in stealing-into-the-bathroom - to-cry-my-eyes-out kind of hard . I can 't begin to imagine what it was like for John . I couldn 't bear to put him through this again . But if it means we can catch his son 's killer ... ljust can 't go to him until I know if what I saw means anything . You said this case involves some kind of phenomenon ? I don 't know if it was a psychic experience or what , but when we found his son ... I had a vision . It was as if , forjust a moment , the body was ... changed . Changed ? into what ? Ashes . It looked like ashes . The thing of it is , Agent Doggett told me he saw it too . He 's spent the last few years convincing himself he didn 't . That even if he did , it didn 't mean anything . - What do you think it means ? - I can 't shake the feeling that it 's a clue . That it could somehow point to who 's responsible , if only I let it . And now I 've seen it again . A thousand miles from here , a seemingly unrelated case , and I 've had the same vision . There has to be a reason for it , a reason it 's happening now . Sir , immediate family only . You fellas just don 't listen . You have to go now . - Hey ! Hey ! - You stay out of my life ! - Stay out of my business ! - Take it easy ! You want something on me , ask ! I don 't want to get calls about you ! You got that ? I don 't want anything . I was asked to look into this file . - Who asked you ? - ( Reyes ) Agent Doggett . - What are you doing ? - Is this you ? Is this you looking into this ? Yes . | asked Agent Mulder . You asked him what ? It 's nothing for him to bother with . Why don 't you calm down and let her explain the connection to you ? - The connection ? To what ? - ( Reyes ) lwas gonna tell you , John . I was in New Orleans on a case - a shooting . Something that I saw connected back to Luke . A vision . Not this again ! You 're not gonna make something out of nothing . Bob Harvey . Does that name mean something or nothing to you ? Bob Harvey was a suspect in the death of my son . We questioned him , but then we realised he wasn 't our man . ( Reyes ) Agent Mulder pointed it out . Bob Harvey was killed last night in a car crash , fleeing the police near a shooting in New Orleans . He died in front of the building where the shooting occurred . - What 's the connection ? - That 's it . - That 's it ? - And then there was the vision . No , I don 't care what you saw - leave it alone . And you leave it the hell alone . I know there is something here . Good . ( doorbell ) - Is your mommy home ? - Mom ! ( woman ) Mia ? - Katha Dukes ? - Yeah . Sorry about the late hour . My name is Monica Reyes . I 'm with the FBI . I believe that we 're all born good , uncorrupted , and life itself does the corrupting . But , you know , someone like Jeb , he just isn 't capable of this . - Are you close to your brother ? - Very . Jeb lived here in the house with us till he went down south . He loves his niece . Does the name Bob Harvey mean anything to you ? Did Jeb ever deal with him ? No . I think I 'd know . Why ? No reason . It 's the answer I was kind of expecting , actually . ( phone rings ) Hello ? - ( man ) Katha ? - Yes ? Katha , it 's Jeb . I can 't talk now . It 's been a very bad day here . It wasn 't me that killed those people . It was somebody else , I 'm telling you . You 're gonna have to call back later . ( knocking ) Hi . I 'm sorry to bother you . I got a flat tyre back a ways . What are you doing here , Doggett ? Iwas , um ... ljust came by to see how you 're doing . I 'm , uh ... Ifeel all druggy . Do you mind ? Thank you . They say you 're stabilised , but we 've been worried . Who 's " we " ? You know ... Me and Agent Mulder and ... What 's wrong , Agent Doggett ? You don 't seem too good yourself . You worked with Agent Mulder for ... How long ? A long time . You never believed in any of this stuff , this ... paranormal , or whatever you call it . So , what changed your mind ? I realised it was me . That I was afraid . Afraid to believe . ( Scully ) Why do you ask ? Agent Doggett , why do you ask ? Some other time . Agent Mulder ? I was looking for Agent Doggett . Well , that 'd make sense . It 's not my office any more . But old habits die hard . - What are those ? - Cases involving images like you described . People near crimes who experience visions of death , disassociated from reality . - And what did you find ? - Nothing . These visions are so random as to have absolutely no significance to the cases they 're supposed to pertain to . - You 're wrong . - I think I know these files . And I know what I saw . There 's a reason these things are happening . There is something at work here , and it all began with the man killed in the car crash , Bob Harvey . I think that 's a coincidence . I think that life is full of them . And full of patterns , things we see but can 't comprehend . You believe that . Why can 't you believe this ? There 's an opening coming up in this office soon . You might wanna apply . Is that why you won 't help him ? I have a sick friend in the hospital and I think I should go see her . I hope she gets well . This office needs at least one person with an open mind . - You 'll say anything , won 't you ? - Only when I think I 'm right . What am I doing here ? Been asking myself that same question , Agent Doggett . But the tenacious Agent Reyes won 't let go of this one . Of what ? She 's got a murder victim , a woman found shot . She thinks it 's by the same man who killed those people in New Orleans , Jeb Dukes . What does she want from me ? She wants to know if you see it too - what she 's been seeing . I told you , there 's no connection . Agent Doggett ? I 'm sorry , Agent Reyes . I don 't see it . I think you do . You 're just afraid to go there . You just keep shooting till you hit something , don 't you ? You 'd rather blind yourself to the connections , but I can 't . You keep talking about these connections . Connections to what ? To who ? What if this is a thread of evil connecting through time , through men , through opportunity , connecting back to you ? In India , in Africa , in Iran , in the Middle East , in the Far East , most of the world , they take it as a given . They see evil in death the way other people see God in a rose . I saw Elvis in a potato chip once . - You know what I 'm talking about . - Yes , I do . I do , but if this man doesn 't see it , he doesn 't see it , right ? You awake ? Yeah . What did the doctor say ? That I had a partial abruption . Which means that my placenta started to tear away from the uterine wall . They 're going to need to monitor me for a while . But you 're gonna be fine ? Yeah . Where have you been ? I 've been out in the field with Agent Doggett and this female agent from New Orleans . Agent Reyes . Yeah , I like her . You 're nothing at all alike . Well then , neither are you and I . - So this is a case you 're working on ? - Yeah . Actually , one that involves Agent Doggett 's son - the son who died . He 's never talked to me about him , but I know something . Are you able to help him at all ? You can 't help a man who can 't help himself . He 's worth the effort , Mulder . You got a half an hour to play in your room before Mommy has dinner ready . - Mia ? - OK . ( gasps ) - What are you doing here ? - I 'm coming home . - The FBI was here , Jeb . - I didn 't do what they said . It wasn 't me , OK ? It wasn 't . What is that on your face ? What ? Is that blood ? I don 't know how that got there . - I need the truth , Jeb . - Please believe me , Katha . It 's not me , OK ? I need help . Please . Mom ? Is that Uncle Jeb ? Yeah , sweetheart . Yeah , it is . It 's me . ( Doggett ) Jeb Dukes , middle name , Larold . No Larold ? OK . Thanks , anyway . What are you doing , John ? I 'm looking into this case . You 're looking in the wrong way . There are a hundred agents in this building who can phone canvass . But there 's only two who can solve crimes with telepathy - you and me . So we 'll just read the tea leaves on this one , and there it is - case closed ? - John ... - Dammit , you wanna find this guy . I 'm trying to find him . What do you want from me ? I want you to be honest ... with yourself ... about what you saw that day , honest about what your feelings tell you . Feelings don 't solve crimes . What does it matter what my feelings are ? How the hell 's that gonna get the job done ? I 'm not talking about the job , John . What are you scared of ? Why does it scare you ? I gotta believe that I did everything I could to find my son . You did do everything to find your son . I gotta believe that I did everything I could to save him , to get him back safe , to not let him down . I gotta believe that I did everything humanly possible . Cos if I can 't believe that , then these other possibilities that you talk about , that Mulder talks about , that Agent Scully talks about , if they 're real ... if they 're real , then ... that 's something else I could have done to save my son . ( phone rings ) Monica Reyes . Katha ? Katha , wait . Jeb Dukes ' sister . He 's there at the house with her . This guy somehow has some link to my son , and I 'm damn sure gonna find out what it is . " Hansel and Gretel had overheard everything their parents had said . " " ' Shh ' said the boy . " " ' l 'll find a way out , I promise you , and when ... " ' Mia , honey ? - Can you come here , please ? - Uncle Jeb 's reading to me . That 's OK. ljust need you a minute . Can you just come here ? Who 's here ? She just wants to talk , Jeb . | just want you to tell her what you told me . She can help you . Who ? - I said who , dammit ! - Come on , baby . - Uncle Jeb ! - You lied to me ! Just get back ! Go ! Mommy ! Let me go , Uncle Jeb ! Mommy , help ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Help ! Hands in the air ! Federal agent . I 'm armed. I 'll shoot . - You drop the gun ! - Let her go ! - Mommy ! - l 'll shoot her , I swear ! | just need to talk to you . Mommy . Mommy . Mommy ! lwon 't hurt you . - Stay back . - Mommy ! Mommy ! I said stay back ! - ( gunshoD - ( Mia screams ) Mommy ! Mommy ! Mia ! Mia ! What have you done ? This man needs help ! You 're not gonna die on me now . You hear me ? You 're gonna make it . - ( Reyes ) John . - The parade stops here . If you want to save him , let the doctors do their work . Who 's immediate family here ? - I am . - Come with me . I 'm gonna need you to fill out some information for me . All right ? - There is nothing more you can do . - You can 't tell me that now . Maybe saving this girl was the reason . Maybe that 's what this was all about . Maybe that 's what I saw and why I saw it . For that kid . Go home , John . There 's nothing here for you to do . ( Mulder ) Agent Doggett . She just fell back to sleep . | just wanted to check to see how she 's doing . I 'm here with this other thing . We caught this killer , Jeb Dukes . He 's in the ICU . He may not make it . And now you 're wondering if there really was a connection ? When I first came to work at the FBI , I worked at Violent Crimes . I saw the worst of humanity . I saw monsters . And I 'd wonder how they became that way , how these men became so evil . I know there were psychological explanations - victims of their environment , or parents - but the scientific explanations were never satisfying . I began to think about evil like a disease . You know , that it goes from man to man or age to age . Most of us think we 're incapable of any acts of evil . And we are . We can stifle that momentary urge to kill or to hurt . We have some kind of immunity to it . But I think it 's possible that there 's ... an occurrence in somebody 's life , a tragedy or a loss , that leaves them vulnerable , hurts their immunity to evil . And all of a sudden , at that point in their lives when they 're weakened , they 're open to evil . And they can become evil . If that were true , then what you 're saying is ... this man we wheeled in here tonight is infected with evil . The same evil that killed my son . You really believe that , Agent Mulder ? I 'm not really a good test for questions like that . I 'll believe almost anything . But the pisser is , you may never know . It may be like Agent Reyes says . It could be random and meaningless , who it affects , who it goes to . What if it isn 't ? Then you 'd be seeing something that I don 't , Agent Doggett . ( alarm beeping ) Somebody ! Doctor ! - Push one gram of epi . - Right here . Call it . I 'm sorry . Time of death : 10.57pm. You killed him . - Drop the weapon ! - No ! Drop it ! I need a doctor ! ( nurse ) Oh , my Lord . - I need a doctor , stat . - It 's over . It 's over now . It 's never over . ( Scully ) Mulder , you never fail to surprise me . ljust wish I felt like eating it right now . That 's cool . We can just wait for the cheese to congeal and eat it later . You miss your regular pizza man , don 't you ? Yes . That 's OK . He 's coming by later . - I bet you forgot about that , didn 't you ? - No , I didn 't , actually . I thought about it a lot while Iwas lying in my hospital bed , wondering what on earth you could have given me . And ? Oh , my God ! Oh , Mulder . Is it what you imagined ? Not even close . Oh , my . That 's the wrong doll , actually . But then that 's the other gift that you gave me , Mulder . Courage ... to believe . And I hope that 's a gift I can pass on . ( child ) I made this !

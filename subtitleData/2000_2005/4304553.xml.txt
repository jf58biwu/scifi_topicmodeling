 [ Whooping Wildly ] Yeah , dudes ! Welcome to your Dumb Ass Show . ! I am Sky Commander Winky and this is the beautiful Cap 'n Dare ! Yeah , baby ! Woo-hoo ! The biggest dumb ass I know . Thank you , Sky Commander . Yes , Captain Dare will show you what a dumb ass he really is . But be forewarned , only a stupid dumb ass would neglect to take every safety precaution in the stunts you 're about to witness . [ Grunts ] Now , the physics alone took almost five minutes of calculations . Oh , oh ... yes ! Yeah , dude , fire when ready . Aah , mother [ Bleep ] ! What the [ Bleep ] ! [ Groaning ] Now that 's a dumb ass ! Oh , right in the [ Bleep ] target ! Hey , Natalie , come here . How about a kiss for good luck ? Bill , why are you doing this ? His name 's Captain Dare and he 'll be famous one day for going where no dudes have gone before . Hey , if you won 't give me a kiss how about throwing me a magazine ? [ Crowd Laughing ] [ Goofy Retching ] [ Whooping ] [ Engine Accelerating ] [ Crowd Cheers And Whoops ] Yeah ! Yeah ! Oh , yeah ! [ Whooping ] Hey , hey ... that ... that is it ! Whoo ! There it is ! There it is , yes ! That is a dumb ass ! That is a dumb ass ! [ Whooping ] [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Groaning With Disgust ] [ Laughter ] [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Whooping And Laughing ] And now , the awesome Captain Dare will make Dumb Ass history in the scientifically modified Shopping Cart of Doom ... rolling down this hill hitting the launch ramp at an estimated 24.6 miles an hour sailing just over the scrumptious Natalie Gordon who will be holding this flaming torch in her mouth . Whoa , I didn 't say I was going to do anything . What ? This is the money shot , Natalie . We need you . Captain , will you tell her ? Yeah , come on , Natalie , what could go wrong ? What could go wrong ? ! You mean besides landing on me and crushing my head , Bill ? Would you ... ? It 'll be killer . The Captain will jump her her torch will set the cart on fire ... whoosh ... and our daring hero rolling on to salvation into the pool of life . Triumphant . Natalie , come on , just do it for me , please ? Please ? Please ? [ Guy ] Yeah , come on , Natalie . [ Bill ] Come on . [ Crowd Goading ] [ Crowd Giggling ] [ Cheers And Applause ] [ Bill Yelling ] [ Grunts ] [ Crowd Cheering ] Now , that 's a dumb ass . Come on , Bill . Get up . [ Natalie Crying ] Hey , Bill ! Hey , Bill ! [ Crowd Gasps ] [ Screaming ] [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Thanks for coming so quickly . Are you the medical examiner ? Yes , yes , I 'm Dr. Fountain . And you 're the experts from the FBI ? The experts ? Well , I was told you were the experts . We work on the X-Files . Our expertise is the unexplained . We were told you had an unexplained death here . Well , you 're the experts . You tell me . So why don 't you explain exactly what happened here , Doctor ? Well , I can 't . That 's the point . You can 't tell us anything ? Well , all things considered , I 'd prefer not to go on record . Why is that ? Well , it 's the kid 's parents . They 're suing everyone . For what ? Everything . They 're suing the county for making the street too steep the supermarket he stole the shopping cart from the company that made the helmet he was wearing . [ Groans ] Off the record , Doc ... what the hell has that got to do with a supermarket shopping cart ? You familiar with The Dumb Ass Show ? The Dumb Ass Show ? It 's a cable TV show where the kids act like , well , dumb asses . They videotape themselves doing stupid stunts . You mean this was an accident ? I 'd prefer not to get sucked into a legal nightmare here . You investigate the unexplained . How about you explain it to me ? [ Sighs ] Dr. Fountain , do you see this ? What the hell is that ? You 're asking me ? [ Screaming ] [ Flies Buzzing ] [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Thanks for coming so quickly . The message said urgent . What is it you want me to look at here ? We were hoping you could tell us . Is , uh , she the expert ? Well ? What do you think ? Well , I have to say that , uh ... I 've never seen anything quite like this before . Well , something killed this kid . Well , judging from the amount of insect feces in the ear and nasal cavities it appears that they fed at such a furious rate that it caused the boy 's skull to collapse from the inside . His helmet protected his head during the crash . There is no impact trauma here whatsoever . None . You 're saying flies killed him . [ Doggett ] All the kids at the scene ... and the flies choose to attack this boy ? Why ? Maybe they were attracted for reasons we 're not seeing . What if somebody put something in his helmet ? Insect pheromone . You know , " Spanish Fly " ... that stuff you see advertised in the back of magazines that guys use to attract girls . I glance at them for amusement . I may have to brush up on my " Spanish Fly " but I don 't think the science works that way . Anyway , before we start looking for an M.O. I want to find out what kind of fly would act that aggressively . [ Man ] The Musca vetustissima Walker . The Australian bush fly . It craves protein so much it will actually crawl into your open nose , mouth , ears even your eyes to feed on nutritious blood and moisture . Though the New Zealand screw-worm fly often kills its victims in mere moments by burrowing into an open wound or cut . I 'm sorry . I 'm Dr. Rocky Bronzino . Hi . Rocky Bronzino . Hello there . Rocky Bronzino , field entomological expert Rutgers University , at your service . Dr. Bronzino ... Rocky . These flies you mentioned neither of them are indigenous to North America . Are you suggesting that we 've got a virulent foreign vector here ? No . The specimens you collected are your garden - variety Calliphorid . Harmless as , well ... flies . What are you suggesting then ? Nothing . Dr. Fountain brought me in for my scientific expertise . And I must say ... I 'm glad he did . Dr. Bronzino you should know we may be looking at a murder . A murder ? Are there any suspects ? [ Bell Ringing ] Natalie Gordon ... the lady in Captain Dare 's short life and the last person to see him alive . Leave me alone , Winky . It 's for the Dumb Ass Memorial Video . For our fallen hero . Just a few words for Captain Dare , come on . You want a few words , Winky ? You 're a jerk ! And so is your brother for making Bill do all those stupid stunts . Hey , Captain Dare died doing what he loved ! Pushing the envelope . Maybe if you weren 't such a ... Hey , you ! Freaky-deaky . You want your own memorial , huh ? You want to be in Dumb Ass ? Just leave her alone . I 'm talking to you now , freak . [ Laughter ] David Winkle . In my office , right now ! Typical . Lokensgard 's gotta have his mommy stick up for him . Baby . [ Students Laughing ] [ Winky Whooping ] [ Engine Accelerating ] [ Crowd Cheering ] ... that is it ! Whoo ! There it is ! I think I just solved this case . This kid had crap for brains , the flies couldn 't resist . Oh , and you were such a choirboy growing up ? I mean , we did some stupid stuff but we didn 't know it was stupid at the time . This isn 't just stupid , this is glorification of stupid . These kids take enormous pride in being sub-mental . That 's why they call it Dumb Ass . [ Cheering And Whooping ] Mr. David Winkle . Sky Pilot Winky . Just the man we want to see . Come on in . That 's very entertaining , Sky Pilot . Sky Commander , if you don 't mind . And you can call me SheriffJohn when I haul your dumb ass off to jail , Winky . What are you talking about ? We obtained a copy of a recent E-mail you sent offering to sell the video of your friend 's death to the Fox Network . What ? No , no , no , I wrote all the networks . Fox was the only one who had any interest in it . I don 't think you understand . Wait ... you think I killed him ? You think I killed Captain Dare to make money ? My best friend ? Well , looking at this video you were the last person to have contact with him . You handed him his helmet at the top of the hill . I think you put something in it . [ Grunting ] Sit down , Sky Commander . I can 't ! I 'm being attacked ! Oh , God , it 's happening to me ! [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] [ Cheering On Videotape ] [ Winky ] Now that 's a dumb ass ! [ Buzzing ] Where you been ? Dinner 's been on the table almost an hour , young man . I 'm not hungry . Well , then , you sit down here until you get hungry . Dylan . I have something to talk to you about . Dylan ! [ Knocking ] Dylan ? [ Knocking ] Dylan ? [ Music Volume Increases ] [ Clicking ] [ Buzzing ] [ Clicking And Buzzing Continues ] [ Buzzing Gets Louder ] [ Door Opening ] I 'm glad you 're here . I think we just got our first real break . What did you find ? Well , it 's what the entomologist Rocky Bronzino found . The flies that ate of the brain and skull of the victim are all female . Every last one of them . Exactly how is that a break ? Well , what are the chances of that ? You mean that the absence of males suggests there 's a reason for the attack . Behaviorally . Well , something biological is going on . Whether it 's hormonal or chemical something has caused these bugs to attack . Or a need to express themselves . To what ? This is a kid that calls himself " Sky Commander Winky . " Agent Reyes and I were interviewing him as a suspect when this happened . The paramedics arrived and treated him for an aggressive attack of body lice . Hmm . Lice are not altogether uncommon in a school environment . Except that these are better spellers than most of the kids . So what are you saying ? That this is just another Dumb Ass stunt ? [ Reyes ] Well , that was my first thought . But the victim here was just too freaked out by this incident to make me believe he 'd staged this . Which leads me to think that while you may be right about this being a matter of biology , someone is directing the biology . How does one direct bugs ? I don 't know how but we 've been running down a long list of witnesses . [ Reyes ] A loner who was present at every Dumb Ass stunt and who had a run-in with this kid Winky at school just prior to the lice attacking . His name is Dylan Lokensgard . We 're going to want to talk to him . [ Doorbell Ringing ] [ Knock At Door ] Dylan ? [ Knocking ] Dylan ? I want to have a talk with you . [ Knocking ] Honey , can you come out here ? Dylan ? Dylan ! ? Dylan ! [ Car Engine Running ] Where are you going ? To school . I know where you 're going . Well , what did Natalie want ? You stay away from her . Dylan , she 's no good for you . She 's only going to get you into trouble . Natalie and I are friends . We 've been friends since we were kids . But you 're not kids anymore , Dylan . Which is why we need to talk , honey . [ Frustrated Sigh ] You 're going through changes . Your body is going through changes . You don 't understand anything . I don 't want to talk to you . I wish Dad was still here . You don 't know anything about me . Honey , I want what 's best for you . Dylan ! Come back here ! Dylan ! So many flowers ... so little time . Excuse me ? Pheromones , Dr. Scully . Heavy in the air . Nature 's natural attractants . Driving the insect world to go forth and pollinate . I 'm aware of how pheromones work . But according to this device there isn 't a single pheromone to be found out here . Well , that can 't be right . The bio-sensor we use is an actual fly antenna over which the pheromones pass . But I modified the EAG to measure in picograms which makes it sensitive to traces a mile in any direction . But I 'm still not sure why you think that pheromones might cause an otherwise harmless fly to attack a human so violently , Doctor ... Rocky . Rocky . Bugs are small-minded creatures , and therefore very predictable . They don 't have moods , per se . They react to circumstance and stimuli as they have been doing for millennia . So what do you suppose they 're reacting to out here ? It may be the bugs are being somehow driven crazy with desire . You know , they say we humans respond to pheromones , too . Yeah , I tend to agree with that , yeah . " Women 's Dormitory Syndrome . " It 's believed that pheromones are the reason that women who live together share the same menstrual cycle . Fascinating . You know , when a male and female Calliphorid fly mate they stay joined for up to one and a half hours . One and a half , Doctor . You know , Rocky ... I 'm a mother . Mothers are women , too . [ Beeping ] Big hit ! What is it ? A high concentration of C-13 calliphorone ... incoming . [ Rapid Beeping ] [ Dylan ] Natalie ! [ Screaming ] [ Crashing , Branches Cracking ] Dylan ? [ Gasping ] Are you all right ? I 'm fine . What about your bike ? Um , I 'll get it later . I came by your house to see you . Oh , really ? Yeah , your mom made it sound like there was something wrong with you . Me ? I 'm fine . What-What did you want ? [ Sighs ] I wanted to apologize about what happened yesterday in the cafeteria . Winky can be such a jerk . I was just worried about you . W-W-What 'd I say ? Nothing . No one understands . My mom and dad think it 's just going to go away . What I 'm feeling ... You-You mean about Bill ? I wish I could just turn back time . I wish I could just ... make everything go away and start all over again . I know . Like-Like when we were kids . [ Quietly ] Yeah . Remember the night we played hide-and-seek on your street ? Manhunt . We hid in the tree together . Our names are still carved in it . [ Awkward Laugh ] I 'm-I 'm going to get marked late . [ Awkward Laugh ] [ Reyes ] Dylan Lokensgard ? Can you come with us , Dylan ? [ Winky On Video ] And now the awesome Captain Dare will make Dumb Ass history in a scientifically modified Shopping Cart of Doom . Rolling down this hill ... Why are you showing me this ? What do you think of it ? You mean , the Dumb Ass Show ? That , and the kids who make it . I know them , you know ... You ever have contact with Bill ? The kid who played Captain Dare ? No . You have anything against him ? No . Do you think it 's strange that he was attacked and killed by insects ? Who wouldn 't ? What 's going on in here ? We 're talking to Dylan . Oh , no , you 're not . Dylan ... Ma 'am ... No one interrogates my son in my office without my permission . [ Reyes ] Just calm down , Mrs. Lokensgard . - [ Flies Buzzing ] - He 's not a part of that crowd . What are you accusing him of ? [ Doggett ] We 're not accusing him . Just trying to see what he knows . He doesn 't know anything . He was at the crime scene . Yeah , well , so were a lot of kids . Dylan ... [ Buzzing ] Too late , gentlemen . Bugs are gone . Bugs are all gone . Whatever . How 's he doing ? He 's unhurt , apparently . Not so much as a single bite on him . Mrs. Lokensgard ? I don 't think we 've finished talking to Dylan . Oh , yes , you have ! We 're going home . I 've said it before and I 'll say it again : The whole reason this case is attracting flies is because somebody 's full of crap . I think what we just saw was a show . Dylan Lokensgard caused those bugs to attack him to make himself look like a victim instead of the perpetrator . Okay , but how ? This guy 's the Horse Whisperer , only for bugs ? I don 't know how he 's doing it but I may know a way to find out . Where did you get this ? Dylan Lokensgard provided it to us when we interviewed him . I have to warn you , there 's typically not a lot to be found in a teenage boy 's sweaty Kleenex . You were looking for pheromones . Aren 't there pheromones produced in adolescent sweat ? Yes , it 's what causes B.O. , but all too obviously it 's not all that attractive ... to anything . [ Slow Beeping ] [ Faster Beeping ] I 've got a reading here that 's going right off the scale . [ Bronzino ] Holy Toledo ! We 've got pheromones coming out the ying-yang here . C-13 calliphorone , and how . [ Rapid Beeping Continues ] [ Steady Tone ] What happened ? I think my electroantennogram just ... tilted . What 's C-13 calliphorone ? Insect pheromone . Where did you find this mother lode ? A boy named Dylan Lokensgard . That specimen came from him . A boy ... is secreting bug pheromones ? That 's impossible . Preposterous . [ Doggett ] You 're the expert Dr. Bronzino . How else do you explain it , then ? Rocky ? A boy is a boy , a bug is a bug . You can 't have it both ways . Okay , so this boy 's going through puberty , right ? I mean , maybe his body chemistry is somehow just going crazy and it 's his raging teenage hormones that are attracting all these insects . What if it 's more than chemistry or hormones ? More than biology ? Dylan 's not just attracting these bugs he 's using them to act out . Yes , but against what ? We saw him talking to a girl . The one in the Dumb Ass video . Captain Dare 's girlfriend . [ Rock Ballad Playing On CD ] [ Volkswagen Engine Chugging ] Natalie ... [ Whispers ] Natalie ? Dylan ? What are you doing ? I need to talk to you , Dylan . [ Whispers ] You have to be quiet ... It 's my mom , she 's going to hear you . [ Whispers ] I 'm coming up . What ? No . Hey ... You 're going to break your neck . I needed to see you . Shh . I haven 't been here in so long . Since 4th grade . After school . It was a Wednesday in April . " A dream in a mist of gray . " That 's from a Syd Barrett song . How do you know all these things ? My dad told me . Syd Barrett , he was in the band Pink Floyd . He was , like this brilliant guy that nobody understood . Kind of like you ? Me ? I never said I was sorry when your dad disappeared , Dylan . I never said a lot of things . But I want to say them now . I know you 've always cared about me . We 've grown apart , but ... I haven 't forgotten you . And ... after we talked this morning at school I realized ... how special you really are to me . I can 't believe this . After what happened to Bill ... I realized how important it is to have someone who does understand you and ... I wanted to do this . That ... that was amazing . [ Chuckles ] [ Whimpers ] What ... What ... was that ? - What was what ? - Your ... your ... Your mouth , your tongue ... there 's something wrong with you . No , don 't-don 't say that . - I got to go . - Natalie , please . Please , don 't . Just stay . Let me talk to you . [ Engine Starting ] [ Crying ] Natalie , listen to me ! Natalie , please ... Hey , Bug Boy ! How about we go for a little buzz around the block . [ Winky ] So , Lokensgard ... how 'd you do it , huh ? How 'd you kill him ? I thought bugs killed Captain Dare . Yeah , bugs who do what you say . You want to know how I did it ? I 'll show you . But maybe you should get your camera ready . What are you talking about ? I just have to open my mouth . Oh , God ! [ Tires Squealing ] [ Glass Shattering ] Mrs. Lokensgard ? Dylan ? [ Steady Beeping ] I 'm getting a reading here . Trace levels inside the house . Well , I guess that 's probable cause . Dr. Scully ? This is so exciting . I 've never had a partner before . I have . I 'd like to think of it as a hymenopteran relationship . Two scientists using their special knowledge reaching higher than either of them could ever reach alone . And if I may say so , Doctor , you complete me . I got upstairs , you take down . All right . [ Steady Beeping Continues ] Hey ! [ Winky ] Who 's that ? Someone 's coming . Ow ! Get us out ! [ Groaning In Pain ] [ Moaning ] [ Coughing ] [ Moaning ] Oh , God . Ow ! God ! David Winkle , is that you ? Yeah . Now that 's a dumb ass . It wasn 't a stunt , it was , uh ... it was Dylan Lokensgard . He attacked us . He attacked you ? Yeah , the dude 's a freakin ' bug . He chewed right out the back window . Ow ! [ Groaning ] You stay . I 'll go see that Dylan didn 't head to that girl 's house . - [ Phone Ringing ] - Scully . Where are you ? I 'm with Rocky at the Lokensgard house . But there 's nobody here . Yeah , well , I 'm afraid the kid 's on a tear . He 's caused a car accident out here on Glenhaven Road . How 'd he do that ? You better see for yourself . [ Beeping ] C-13 calliphorone . I 'm getting a stiff new reading from up here . Yeah , Dylan 's bedroom 's up there . Unfortunately , he 's not in it . Where are you going ? The kid 's on a rampage . Whoa ! You got my number , partner . Natalie ? Whoever you are , leave me alone . Natalie , I 'm Monica Reyes , with the FBI . I 'm here because I need your help . It 's about Dylan Lokensgard . Don 't say that name around me ! It 's important . You may be the key to this , to stopping him . Dylan Lokensgard is a freak ! I thought he was the normal one . I think Dylan was normal , just like any other kid . Whatever it is he 's going through it has to do with what he 's becoming . He kissed me ! And it 's probably what he 's living for . And now it 's probably why he lost all control and attacked David Winkle and his brother . He attacked Winky ? They 're going to be okay . We just want to make sure he doesn 't hurt anyone else , Natalie . All right ? [ Whimpers ] Come with me . [ Shuddering Gasp ] [ Natalie Whimpering ] Why did you run from me ? What is wrong with you ? I 'm different , Natalie . Isn 't that what you wanted ? Somebody different from Bill and Winky ? You killed Bill . To keep you from being killed . And now you 're coming with me . Just stay where you are , Dylan . [ Steady Beeping ] [ Erratic Beeping ] [ Rapid Beeping ] [ Squeaking ] [ Door Opens And Closes ] [ Dylan ] Don 't try and stop me . That little talk that you wanted to have with me ? It 'll have to wait . Where do you think you 're going ? It 's where we 're going , me and Natalie . I 'll be taking the car . You 'll be doing nothing of the sort . You don 't want to cross me , Mom . I am not some kid everybody can kick around anymore . You think I don 't know what you are ? It 's what I 've been trying to tell you , Dylan to save you from what you are about to do . These are the things I couldn 't tell you . The things I couldn 't tell your father . You are not like the other kids . You never will be . Monica ! Monica ! [ Muffled Shout ] Holy Mother ... Monica , hold on ! Can you hear me ? Monica , can you breathe ? Monica , talk to me . He 's got the girl . Where 'd they go ? To Dylan 's house . That 's where Scully is . She lost phone contact with the entomologist , Bronzino . [ Crickets Chirping ] [ Whimpering Sobs ] Where are they ? [ Whimpers ] Natalie ! [ Whimpering ] [ Muffled Moaning ] [ Gasps ] [ Bronzino , Muffled ] Help me . Help me . Oh ... [ Panting ] [ Gasping ] [ Scully ] Four more bodies were found in the Lokensgard attic [ Scully ] Four more bodies were found in the Lokensgard attic including that of Michael Lokensgard Dylan 's father , long reported missing . It now appears that he , like the others , fell victim to Dylan 's mother who , in Dr. Rocky Bronzino 's expert opinion , was neither human nor insect but something in between . A biological anomaly , whose difference from the rest ofhumanity could be hidden only for so long . However strong Dylan Lokensgard 's yearning to fit in , to win acceptance , to love and to be loved he could not defeat the unseen forces which direct behavior . In the struggle between our desire to determine who and what we will be and the identity which biology defines for us there can only be one outcome . But even in victory , there are forces biology cannot defeat ... the stirrings of the soul the mysteries of desire the simple truth that the heart wants ... what the heart wants . [ Child ] I made this .

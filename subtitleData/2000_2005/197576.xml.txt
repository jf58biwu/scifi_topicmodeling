 There 's simply no way to shield against every weaponized agent . Instead , I can make super-immune systems ... by strenqtheninq the human cellular response . Banner , I know where you 're qoinq . But manipulatinq the immune system is danqerous and stupid . The president 's science advisors made it absolutely clear- - no human subjects . [ Sizzling ] David , I have wonderful news . I 'm qonna have a baby . [ Woman Groaning ] [ Screaminq ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Wailinq ] [ Wailing Continues ] [ Cooinq ] What 's it qonna be ? Whoa , look at that , Bruce . Huh ? Want a dinosaur ? Let 's have a little fiqht . [ Roarinq ] [ Bruce Roaring ] [ David ] You don 't scare me . [ Roarinq Continues ] That 's a delicious eyeball . Ooh , you 're biq and qreen and scary . I 'm qonna run away . Really , speakinq of Cheryl , quess what- - Bruce , you 're hurt ! Jack hit him with the stick , but Bruce wouldn 't hit him back . He just stood there , shakinq . [ Whispers ] It 's okay . Yeah , strange he didn 't make a peep . Any other kid would 've wailed his head off . That 's Bruce . He 's like that . He 's just so ... bottled up . The samples we found in your lab- - they were human blood . You 've iqnored protocol . You had no riqht snoopinq around in my lab . That 's my business . Wronq , Banner . It 's qovernment business , and you 're off the project . Attention , all personnel . Fail-safe has been initiated . [ Alarm Blaring ] Gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minutes ! Evacuate immediately ! I repeat , evacuate immediately ! [ Siren Blaring ] [ Gasps ] [ Siren Continues Blaring ] - Edith ? - David , what 's qoinq on ? - I qotta talk to you , Edith . - Bruce , stay here . [ Edith ] What are you doinq ? [ Edith , David Talking , Muffled , Faint ] [ Muffled Talking Continues ] [ Yellinq , Roarinq ] [ Yellinq , Roarinq Continue ] [ Edith Screams ] What are you doing ? [ David ] I 'm trying to tell you what has to be done . ! [ Edith ] David , please stop it . ! No . ! [ David , Edith Screaming , Shouting ] [ Edith ] No . ! No . ! [ David ] Yes . ! David . ! No . ! [ David Screaming Hysterically ] [ Boy Groans ] [ Groaninq Continues ] Bruce . Bruce , wake up , son . Bruce . Bruce . Another niqhtmare ? I don 't know . I don 't remember . Hi , Mom . Already off to colleqe . Gonna miss you terribly . I 'll miss you too . Please , come here . Look at you . Soon to be a qreat scientist . I quess . I mean , who knows ? I do . There 's somethinq inside you ... so special . Some kind of qreatness . I 'm sure someday you 're qonna ... share it with the whole world . But as far as I 'm concerned , security ouqhta be- - Good morninq . Good morninq , Dr. Krenzler . Security ouqhta be beefed up . In a place like this you can 't be too careful . Bruce . ! Big day . Did you sleep ? I didn 't sleep . I slept okay . Is Betty here ? She 's around . I really qotta say , seeinq you in that stylin ' head wear- - You 're implyinq somethinq about my helmet ? You look like a massive nerd , even around other scientists . Can I just ask- - Were you wearing the helmet while she dumped you ? See , it protects my very important brain , Harper . Go prep the samples . - Hey . I found you . - Betty , hey . I hate them . Wait , I just qot here . Who do we hate ? The review board . We have to make a presentation on Tuesday . Ah . And you 're qonna make it with me . You think I should ? Yeah . You 're qreat with that stuff . You start talkinq about microbes and nanomeds , you sound almost ... passionate . I 'm sorry . That was rude . Look , nobody expects this to be easy , us workinq toqether after beinq ... so close . We were close ? [ Chuckles ] Look , if I could be more ... whatever , you know- - I 'm ... just- - Don 't . It 's not your fault . Really . You 're just a by-product ... of my inexplicable obsession with emotionally distant men . I 'll qet over us . Good for you . Anyway , I 'm just really stressed about this review . If we don 't qet impressive results today , we 're qonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday . Well , then , let 's qo be impressive . [ Typing On Keyboard ] Harper ? Ready when you are . Let 's hit it . Are we passinq inspection ? Safeties all going green . Countdown 's started . Nanomeds released . Four seconds . Okay , nanomeds fully dispersed . Okay , let 's hit Freddie with the qamma radiation . Gamma exposure . Nanomeds now active . [ Harper ] Nanomeds replicating cells on border . It 's workinq . [ Harper ] Cell copy to disassemble ratio holding within one percent . [ Harper ] Imbalanced nanomed activity . [ Siqhs ] You wanna go to the review board on Monday and tell ' em ... we 've developed a brand-new method for explodinq froqs ? Yeah , I think maybe there 's a market for it . I mean , what if there 's a plaque ? What have you had , Betty , like , one beer ? I 'm just sa- - I 'm just sayinq , you know , froqs start fallinq from the sky , who do they come to ? We 'd be world-renowned . Make any parent proud . I bet they would be . They actually did want me to be a scientist . I mean , your birth parents . Guess we 'll never know . [ Siqhs ] I don 't understand why you don 't want to find out about them . They 're dead . They died before I can remember anythinq . Why do you always come back to this ? Don 't know . I quess I fiqure there 's more to you than you like to show . I quess there couldn 't be any less . Riqht . So now we come full circle back to that . Nice work , Betty . Betty . Glen . Hey . Hi . [ Chuckles ] Hi . What happened to your uniform ? Oh , I , uh- - I switched over . I 'm still workinq with your father , but- - Well , you know , the military 's subcontractinq out all the most interestinq work , and- - Can 't arque with a paycheck . I basically run all the labs on the base now . Oh . Hey , you 're uh- - you 're lookinq qood . You 're the qenetics expert . Ah , the qood old colleqe days . So , how 's business ? What do you want ? [ Clears Throat ] All riqht , I 'll cut to the chase . I 've been hearinq interestinq thinqs about what you quys are doinq here . Your little molecular machines have some incredible implications . How would you like to come work for Atheon ? Get paid 1 0 times as much as you earn now ... and own a piece of the patents . You just have to say the word . Two words : the door . [ Siqhs ] General ? Come in . Talbot wanted you to see this , sir . It 's about a lab Atheon is tarqetinq for acquisition and removal to desert base . Why isn 't it qoinq throuqh N.S.C. ? It , uh , concerns your dauqhter , sir . Hi . Sorry . Hey , what happened to Benny ? Is he not workinq the niqht shift anymore ? Benny 's dead . I 'm the new quy . Oh . Good to meet you . Same . [ Camera Timer Buzzing ] - [ Click ] - Let 's try another . Mmm , no . Stay here . I look tired anyway . Yeah , but you look qreat . What 's the matter ? [ Chuckles ] It 's these dreams , Doctor . I keep havinq them , and they 're terrible . Tell me about your dream . Well , it starts- - it starts with a memory- - I think it 's my first memory . It 's this imaqe I have ... from when I was maybe two years old . Do you think it 's just a dream ? No , I think it 's somethinq that happened ... when I was livinq at a desert base with my father . [ Betty ] Anyhow , the dream goes on and ... suddenly I 'm alone . That 's terrible . You know I 'd never hurt you . [ Siqhs ] [ Whimpering ] [ Rattling ] [ Panting ] Hey there . [ Continues Pantinq ] What 's your name , darlin ' ? Eh ? What 's your name ? [ Snarling ] Okay . It 's okay . [ Panting Continues ] [ Footsteps ] [ Keys Jangling ] [ Typinq ] [ Typing Continues ] [ Siqhs ] [ David ] I gotta talk to you , Edith . [ Edith ] Bruce , stay here . ! [ Terrified Gasp ] [ Pantinq ] [ Dog Whimpering ] [ Man ] " C ... T ... G ... A ... G. " Bruce . My Bruce . Good morninq . Glen dropped by . What 's he doinq here ? You know , Dr. Krenzler , you and I have never had the chance to qet to know each other properly . Well , that 's because I don 't want to qet to know you , properly or improperly . [ Beepinq ] So leave . Hey , no worries . Let me qive you a little heads-up . There is a hairsbreadth between friendly offer ... and hostile takeover . I 've done my homework . The work you 're doinq here is dynamite . Think : GIs embedded with technoloqy ... that makes them instantly repairable on the battlefield ... in our sole possession . That 's a hell of a business . Well , it 's not what we 're doinq here . We 're doinq the basic science for everyone . You know , someday I 'm qonna write a book ... and I 'm qonna call it When Stupid Ideals Happen To Smart , Penniless Scientists . In the meantime , Bruce , you will be hearinq from me . About Glen , I , um- - There 's nothinq to talk about . Okay . I just wanted to say , don 't worry about him- - I 'll handle it . How ? I 'm qonna call my father , ask him to exert some pressure . Last I heard , you and your father weren 't speakinq . Hmm . Well ... I quess now I have somethinq to talk with him about . I think this circuit 's kinda fried . I don 't know . Maybe you wanna come take a look at it . Okay , I 'll be riqht there . [ Cracklinq ] Aah ! [ Harper Groaning ] The gamma 's too high . ! Bruce , I can 't stop it . ! Harper , qet out ! Get out ! [ Door Opens ] How 's Harper ? He 's all riqht . You saved him . I don 't think he 's cominq back to the lab for a while , thouqh . [ Siqhs ] I don 't understand how this is possible . You should be dead . [ Siqhs ] They worked- - the nanomeds . I mean , I feel qreat . I feel like- - I don 't know . They must have , like , fixed me . Bruce , they 've killed everythinq else that they 've come into contact with . Are you sure the doctor checked ? The doctor qave me the full workup . He wants to know where he can qet what I 'm takinq . I 'm a hundred percent . More . What do you mean ? Remember my bad knee ? Well , now it 's my qood knee . Bruce , this isn 't funny . I was watchinq you . You were qonna die , and I was qonna have to watch you die . Betty ... I 'm sorry . Really . Hey , I 'm not qonna explode . Okay ? Yeah . [ Snifflinq ] You should qet some rest . And I 'm fine . Really . I 've never felt better . [ Pantinq , Gaspinq ] [ Quiet Growlinq ] Your name is not Krenzler . It 's Banner . What ? Your name- - it 's Banner . Bruce Banner . Bruce . How did you qet in here ? I work here now . In the labs . The late shift . It keeps me close to you . You always work so late yourself with your friend Miss Ross . No , no . Please . Please . Let me . You 're not well . You 've had a terrible accident . You 're wonderinq why you 're still alive . You 're thinkinq there 's somethinq inside . Somethinq different ... inexplicable . I can help you understand , if you 'll let me . If you 'll ... forqive me . Look , mister , I 'm sure I have nothinq to forqive you for . So perhaps you should leave now . I 'll be fine . You must know . You may not want to believe it , but I can see it in your eyes . So much like your mother 's . Of course , you 're my flesh and blood . But then , you 're somethinq else too , aren 't you ? My physical son , but the child of my mind too . No . You 're lyinq . My parents died when I was a small boy . No , no , that 's not true . That 's what they wanted you to believe . The experiments , the accident- - all top secret . They put me away for 30 years . Thirty years ! Away from you . Away from our work . But they couldn 't keep me forever . After all , I 'm sane . They had to admit it . You see , everythinq ... your extraordinary mind ... has been seekinq all these years ... it 's been inside you . Now we will understand it . We will harness it . [ Phone Rings ] No , don 't answer it . It 's Miss Ross aqain . There 's somethinq you need to know about her , Bruce . Somethinq troublesome . Let me protect you from her . No . Get out . - Bruce- - - Get out ! - [ Barkinq , Snarlinq ] - Sit ! [ Doqs Whimperinq ] [ Tremblinq ] We 're qonna have to watch that temper of yours . [ Gas Hissinq ] [ Whimperinq ] [ Snarling ] [ Snarlinq Continues ] You sure you 're okay ? Yeah , just qlad to be out of bed . Got a messaqe from my father . He 's cominq to see me . Your father ? Mmm . When ? Lands in about an hour . [ Betty ] The funny thing is , he called me . Hi , Dad . Hello , Betty . [ Waitress ] Here , ma 'am . Thanks . You 're welcome . Sir ? Thank you . You 're welcome . Look , I 'm qonna qet riqht to it . It 's about Glen , isn 't it ? He 's been snoopinq around my lab . Glen noticed some thinqs , asked me to make some inquiries . Are you here to ... question me ? No . We 've turned up some surprisinq thinqs . This Krenzler you work with- - you know who he really is ? How much do you actually know about him ? I think the question is , what is it that you know about him ? - Well , riqht now , I 'm not- - - Not at liberty to disclose it to me . Riqht . Riqht . You know , I think I was hopinq that ... maybe this time you just ... honestly wanted to see me aqain . - You 've qot this all wronq , Betty . - Do I ? Yes . I do want to see you . I really wish that I could believe you . [ David ] Everything ... your extraordinary mind has been seeking ... all these years , it 's been inside you . [ Phone Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ On Answering Machine ] Hi , you 've called Dr. Krenzler . Please leave a message and I 'll call you right back . [ Answering Machine Beeps ] [ Betty On Machine ] Bruce , hey . Are you there ? Look , um , I think I screwed up . My father- - It 's like he suspects you of something . I don 't know . - [ Thud ] - I was so impatient , like always . I didn 't hear him out . I don 't know , I- - I just think that they 're planning something with the lab . So , um , uh- - [ Grunts ] Call me . Okay ? Bye . - [ Receiver Hangs Up ] - Betty ? [ Growlinq ] [ Bruce Roaring ] [ Groaninq , Screaminq ] [ Yellinq ] Dispatch ! Dispatch ! We have a 41 5 at the lab ! Send Berkeley P.D. now ! Send ' em now ! [ Snortinq , Breathinq Heavily ] [ Roars ] Watch out ! [ Pantinq Slowly ] [ David ] Edith ? [ Edith ] David , what 's going on ? - I qotta talk to you , Edith . - [ Edith , Echoing ] Bruce , stay here . [ Growlinq ] [ Gasps , Yells ] [ Roarinq ] [ Sobbinq ] My Bruce . [ Knocking ] [ Knockinq ] Bruce ? There was some sort of explosion . They wouldn 't let us into the buildinq . I was worried about you . Well , I 'm okay . What happened to you last niqht ? I had the most vivid dream . [ Siqhs ] It was like beinq born . Cominq up for air . Liqht hittinq my face . Screaminq . My heartbeat- - it was , like , boom ... boom ... boom . Were you at the lab ? No . But somethinq- - And there was that man . The one with the doqs . Who ? That new janitor . He said he was my father . [ Knocking ] I 'll qet it . [ Mouths Words ] My father . My , my . So this is the younq Bruce Ban- - Krenzler . I think you left somethinq in your lab last niqht . [ Wallet Lands On Table ] Mitchell . Escort my daughter outside . I 'll join her shortly . I 'd rather stay here . Now , Betty . It 's okay . I 'll be fine . Keep him under observation . I 'll be back . [ Car Door Closes ] [ Seat Belt Buckles ] What ? Your friend in there . There 's a qood chance he 's cauqht up in some very bad business . Unfinished business . And I promise you , I 'm qonna qet to the bottom of it . You have my word I 'll make sure he 's cared for . But as of riqht now , he is incommunicado . And for the next few days at least , you 're qonna stay away from here . For your own qood . Okay , and that 's for the new quy on the niqht shift , riqht ? Great . Thank you . I appreciate it . [ Dogs Barking ] Dr. Ross . [ Scoffs Quietly ] How unexpected . Please come in . I 'm sorry to just show up at your house like this . Uh- - I came to ask you somethinq that ... I really have no business askinq . He told you ? He said you talked to him . Oh . Please sit down . Bruce was at the lab last niqht . He said that you were there too . But he can 't remember much about it . I need to fiind out what happened . So , you want to know , uh , what 's wronq with him ... so you can fix him ? Cure him , chanqe him . My father 's with the military . He seems to think he 's involved in some kind of threat to national security . Mmm . Your father . Ross . You brought your father down upon his head ? How little you understand , Miss Ross , and how danqerous your iqnorance has become . I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . My son is ... unique . That 's why you can 't relate to him . And because he is unique , the world will not tolerate his existence . Will they ? But you- - you try , don 't you ? Yes . And a very beautiful woman like you , your attentions ... can 't be completely unwanted . Can they ? No . Not with eyes like yours , watchinq expectantly , lovinqly . But I 'm afraid we 're both too late to help him . There 's nothinq I can do for him ... or for you . Besides , he 's made it clear he wants nothinq to do with me . His choice . Now , if you 'll excuse me , Miss Ross , I have some work to do . And don 't worry about the doqs . You 'll be fine . Just don 't look ' em in the eyes . Good-bye . [ General Ross ] He gets released , and a month later your lab is destroyed . What a coincidence . So you 're not qonna tell me where he is , are ya ? How many times do I have to tell you ? I 'd like to help you , but I just don 't know . You know who I am . Riqht , Banner ? Your Betty 's father . You 're a hiqh-rankinq qeneral . Let 's cut the crap . I 'm the quy who had your father tossed away , and a lot more like him , and I 'll do the same with you if I feel so disposed . You understand ? If you had him tossed away , then why are you askinq me ? I don 't remember . I was always told my father was dead . Don 't play with me ! You were four years old when you saw it . When I saw what ? You were riqht there . How could anyone forqet a thinq like that ? What ? Oh , some more repressed memories . Just tell me . I 'm sorry , son . You 're an even more screwed-up mess than I thouqht you 'd be . Until we get to the bottom of this , your lab has been declared a top-secret military site ... and you 're not qonna qet a security clearance to qet back into it ... or any other lab that 's doinq anythinq more interestinq than ... tryinq to fiqure out the next qeneration of herbal hair qel . One more thinq . If you ever ... come within a thousand yards of my dauqhter aqain , I 'll put you away for the rest of your natural life . [ Sniffs ] Doqs ! [ Barking , Snarling ] Go ! Go qet her ! And let nothinq stand in your way ! [ Barking , Snarling Continue ] Go ! [ Phone Rings ] [ Phone Continues Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] Hello ? [ David On Phone ] Bruce ? So , they think they can just throw you away as they did me . [ Conversation , Faint ] What 's wronq with me ? What did you do to me ? I qot a visit today . A very unwelcome visit . I 'm afraid my hand is beinq forced . What did you do to me ? You so much want to know , don 't you ? But I think no explanation will serve you half as well .. as the experience . In any case , I still don 't quite understand it myself . If they 'd only let me work in peace- - Of course , my betters would have none of that . [ Bruce On Phone ] So you experimented on yourself , didn 't you ? And passed on to me ... what ? [ David ] An alteration . Genetic . A deformity . I quess you could call it that . But an amazinq strenqth too . And now , finally unleashed , I can harvest it . No . You 'll do no such thinq . I will isolate it and treat it myself . I 'll remove it and I 'll kill it before it does any real harm . I 'll bet you and your Betty would love to destroy it . But would you really destroy part of yourself ? I don 't think so . And as for Betty , I 'm sendinq her a surprise visit ... from some four-leqqed friends of mine . You see , I manaqed to culture some of your very own DNA , Bruce , and the results are tremendous . They 're unstable , but very powerful . What about my DNA ? [ David ] Let 's just wait and see what Betty makes of the results , huh ? No . You 're crazy . I won 't let you . [ Murmurinq ] Get your hands off of me . Talbot , what 's this- - Inside , asshole . I wanna talk to you . Listen , my father 's qoinq after Betty- - What makes you think you can qo behind my back and qet Ross to cut me out , huh ? [ Groans ] Listen to me ! Betty 's in trouble ! [ Both Gruntinq ] You pathetic freak . Betty 's in danqer . I swear to you , she 'll be killed . I can state the obvious . [ Groaninq , Pantinq ] Somethinq tells me you aren 't in much of a position to be makinq stupid threats to anyone . [ Gruntinq , Groaninq Continues ] Talbot . Yeah ? You 're makinq me anqry . Oh , am I ? [ Quiet Growlinq ] [ Growlinq Continues ] [ Roarinq ] [ Growlinq ] - [ Groans ] - [ Men Shoutinq ] [ Roarinq ] Ohh ! Oh ! [ Man ] I got him . ! Open fire . ! [ Car Alarm Blarinq ] [ Groans ] [ Loud Thud , Crack ] [ Rustling ] [ Exhales ] [ Gasps ] [ Whispers ] Bruce ? [ Leaves Rustling , Twig Snaps ] [ Rustling Continues ] [ Snarling , Growling ] [ Whines ] [ Screams ] [ Keys Rattling ] [ Enqine Starts ] [ Snarlinq , Barkinq ] [ Growlinq ] [ Grunts ] [ Ferocious Shout ] [ Roars ] [ Gasps ] [ Betty Gasps ] [ Hulk Panting ] [ Pantinq ] He sent these doqs , didn 't he ? But I killed them ! [ Grunts ] [ Screams , Gasps ] [ Rapid Pantinq ] My God . It must be the nanomeds . It must be the qamma exposure . But we 've never seen any effect like this before . No . Deeper . The qamma just unleashed what was already there . Unleashed what ? Me . It . [ Gasps ] It 's okay . [ Gruntinq , Pantinq ] Shh . It 's okay . What were those animals ? My father sent them . He is my father . He wanted me to chanqe . He wanted me to chanqe into that mindless hulk . Why would he want that ? Can you remember anythinq ? Is there anythinq from when you were chanqed ? It was like a dream . About what ? Raqe . Power . And freedom . [ Phone Ringing ] Hello ? Sir . Hello . Dad ? Betty ! Are you all riqht ? I 'm scared . I need your help . Where are you ? How are you ? Okay , I quess . I think that somehow ... your anqer is triqqerinq the nanomeds . How could it ? We desiqned them to respond to physical damaqe . Emotional damaqe can manifest physically . Like what ? Serious trauma . Repressed memories . Your father qrilled me about somethinq that happened to me from early childhood ... that I 'm supposed to remember . He did ? It sounded bad , but ... I honestly don 't remember . The thinq that worries me ... is ... a physical wound is finite , but with emotions , what 's to say it won 't just go on and on ... and start a chain reaction ? You know what scares me the most ? When it happens , when it comes over me ... and I totally lose control , I like it . [ Beeping Sound ] [ Gasps ] It 's okay . I qot you . I 'm sorry . You 'll be okay . It 's just to make you sleep . Tarqet down . Tarqet secure . I 'm qoinq to take you someplace safe . Okay ? Bruce ? Bruce ? Bruce ? [ Man Shouts , Indistinct ] [ Man Shoutinq ] Clear ! Attention on deck . Carry on . [ Betty ] We 're buried out here in the middle of nowhere . How long are you gonna keep him sedated ? For the rest of his natural life , if I have to . You said I could trust you . I 'm your father . You can trust me to do what I think is riqht , not what you think you want . - He is a human beinq . - He is also somethinq else . Suppose he qets out , has one of his little mood swinqs ... in a populated area . Yes , I 'm aware of the potential danqer . I 'm also aware that he saved my life . Yeah , from a mutant French poodle . I 'm indebted to him for that . He also put three men in a hospital , and Talbot 's barely walkinq ! - What do you want me to do ? - I want you to help him ! - Why is he such a threat to you ? - Because I know what he comes from . He is his father 's son , every last molecule of him . He says he doesn 't know his father , but he 's workin 'in the same exact goddamn field his father did . So either he 's lyin ' ... or it 's somethin ' worse , and he 's- - What ? Predestined to follow in his father 's footsteps ? I was qonna say " damned . " Of course you were . But I 'm a scientist . As a scientist , I believe we can fiqure this out and he can be helped . I know you do . Look , whether you know or care , I 've qot a lot of pride in what you 've done . But this is too big for you . Look , I know the qovernment thinks they have a weapon on their hands . Otherwise , he 'd be dead by now . They can probe and prod all they want , and in the meanwhile , just let me try to help him . Nobody knows him better than I do . What did David Banner do to him ? Cover left ! Clear left . Cover riqht ! [ Siren Wailinq ] [ Air Hissinq ] [ Inhales ] [ Yells ] [ Pantinq ] [ Clinkinq ] [ Creakinq ] [ Exhales ] What 's happeninq here ? My hand . You see , the strength of my son 's DNA ... combined with nanomed reconstruction- - You see , I can partake with the essences of all thinqs . Gonna have to ask you to ... put your hands up , pal , okay ? Nice and easy . [ Creakinq ] [ Wheezinq Lauqh ] Do you really believe ... that I am separate from you ? [ Lauqhs ] Whoa ! Where am I ? You 're home . It 's hard to believe we used to live here . I must have seen you or known you . If only I could remember . [ Chains Squeakinq ] This is my old house , isn 't it ? Let 's qo . Please try . [ Shudderinq ] [ Shuddering Continues ] [ Betty ] What is it ? Nothinq . Really ? Damn it . Okay , Betty ... what do you want to know ? What was in that room ? What are you afraid that I 'll see ? [ Gasps ] See ? There 's nothinq . [ Siqhs ] It 's empty . [ Betty ] What do you mean , I don 't have access to him ? [ Ross ] NSA has decided to turn over study of the , uh- - the threat to Atheon . But you 're head of the base . I thouqht you were in charqe . But I don 't set policy , and I still take orders . [ Yells ] I can 't believe Talbot would qo around me like this ! Oh , there 's a lot of powerful people that want in on this . And money to be made- - lots of it . You know the worst part about all this ? When I had David Banner locked up and sent that kid away , I didn 't qive that boy a second thouqht ; he was just collateral damaqe . Well , he isn 't anymore , is he ? What can I do ? [ Siqhs ] You can qo home now . I 'd tell you to go and say good-bye , but I 've already been informed ... that for now all further contact is out of the question . Riqht . [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Hiya , Bruce . How ya feelin ' ? Grub okay in here for ya ? What do you want ? That 's a qood question . See , I need your cells to triqqer some chemical distress siqnals . You know , so you can turn a little qreen for me aqain ... and I can carve off a piece of the real you , analyze it , patent it , make a fortune . Do you mind ? I 'll never let you . I 'm not sure you 've qot much of a choice . [ Screams ] Come on , Bruce . Aren 't you feeling a little angry ? After all , you 've only qot me to play with now that Betty 's dumped you and qone back to Berkeley . [ Screams ] You 're lyinq . You know , for me this is a win-win situation . You turn green , and all these guys come in and kill you ... and I perform the autopsy . - You don 't ... - [ Screaminq Continues ] and I mop the floor with you ... and maybe by accident qo too far and break your neck . Bad science , maybe ... but personally qratifyinq . [ Screams ] Come on , Bruce ! Let 's see what you qot . [ Pantinq ] Never . [ Grunts ] You know , consciously you may control it , but subconsciously , I bet that 's another story . All riqht , let 's jump-start those brain waves . - [ Tapping Keyboard ] - [ Humminq ] [ Edith 's Voice , Indistinct ] Bruce . - My dear Miss Ross . - [ Gasps ] Welcome back . There are two quards riqht outside . You don 't have to worry . I 'm not anqry with you . Not anymore . What do you want ? It 's over for me now . I know that . And soon it 'll be over for Bruce . That 's why I 've come to you- - to ask you if you could persuade your father , as a man , as a father himself , that if I turn myself in now , peacefully ... and before he puts me away forever , that he would let me see my son ... for one last time . Could you do that for me ? It 's out of my father 's hands now . I understand . He 's a puppet now . I don 't blame him . You shouldn 't . You should blame yourself for what you 've done to your son . And what have I done to my son , Miss Ross ? Nothinq . I tried to improve on the limits in myself . Myself ! . Not him !

I could tell from the moment she conceived ... that it wasn 't a son I had given her ... but something else . A monster , maybe . I should have put a stop to it right then , but I was curious and that was my downfall . And as I watched this tiny life unfold , I began to imagine the horror of it , and my curiosity was replaced ... with compassion . But they took away my chance to cure him . Your father threw me out . - What are you doinq ? - I remember that day so well- - every moment , every sensation- - walking into the house , the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand .

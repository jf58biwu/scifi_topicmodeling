 Benny . What are you doing here ? Brother . You should be in the clinic ! Professor ? The senator would like to begin . Brother , help me . Ladies and gentlemen ... dear friends ... God created man . A pity , really , because our dear Charles ... could have done the anatomy better . It 's a joke among the young doctors ... in the Berlin clinic ... but also a sign ... of respect for ... Brother . Look at me ! ... Dr. Charles Muller-LaRousse . Who wouldn 't take off their hat to ... Look at your brother Benny ! Look ! I 'm finished ! I 'm a total wreck ! Security ! Charles , look at me . I can 't live any longer . I feel nothing . I can 't feel anything . Help me . Help me . My God , Benny ! - Are you sure ? - About going to Berlin ? All that medicine shit ... It 's cool to be a doctor . I know lots who aren 't so cool . They 're jerk-offs . So I 'm the first non-jerk-off . I 'd give anything to be able to jerk off again . In Berlin , they 're researching muscle disease ... Don 't let me win all the time . I 'm a cripple , not a retard . I wouldn 't be so sure . I 'm telling you . The best hospital in Germany , in Berlin . He 's a great neurosurgeon . Jupp does all that with brain and nerves . I 'm not taking pancakes to Berlin . Tell her about the neurotransmitters . Joachim . Jupp sounds so working-class . So sorry you 're working-class , milord . Mama , Berlin ! I 'm so excited ! - Why are they called interns ? - It 's just the name , why ? They get to " intern-ally " examine the nurses ! Being a doctor , you can do that , too . I heard that , Willi ! Tell them your crippled brother needs their panties to sniff . Work the pity angle . Come on , we 'll miss the train . Take care , you sick pig . Good luck . You 're always lucky . About all that medicine shit ... I 've never been so sure in my life ! You faggot ! Panties . Deal ? Only if you do your physiotherapy . I 'll check . Doctors stick together . Fuck the therapy . My legs are ruined anyway ! And the insurance won 't cover therapy for my dick ! And don 't become a Berlin fan . Once MSV , always MSV ! MSV forever ! Who wants to be stuck in that hole ? Ground floor , only Filipino nurses and some interns . Joachim from Duisburg . Pancakes from Duisburg . They told my father : " Advanced stage , " which is like , " no chance . " And the insurance wouldn 't pay . So at 13 years old , you say : " I 'll be a doctor . I 'll show ' em . " And a great doctor , you bastards . We have to improve things . Not everyone can afford private insurance . - Young doctor always so nice thoughts . - But then nice thoughts die ... and young doctors . You mean the young doctors nice thoughts die . Lee like nice thoughts ... and nice handsome doctors . It 's me , Fred . I checked Benny 's blood count . He had an overdose of neurocholine ... and I 'm sure he didn 't inject it himself . What do you mean , calm down ? Are you crazy ? Somebody planned his death . We have to tell Charles and the others . What ? An operation , at this hour ? Anybody there ? I 'm really scared . Now come on out . Very funny . What the hell 's going on ? It 's you . I thought this was an emergency . What 's up ? Is the patient here yet ? Yes , he is . Fred Richter ... just too curious . It 's too late for you . Otherwise I 'd say ... get a proper job : TV ... advertising ... event management or Web design . Boss Bamberg . She 's okay . ... 60 hours a week on average ... for 1,000 euros . That 's above average . Your salary is determined by ... I hope , I know , that some of you are here because ... you have a vision . Muller-LaRousse , first inter-plastic nerve transplant . Just missed out on the Nobel Prize . He 's the one whose junkie assistant cut himself open . As chairman here , even I cannot change the hospital system . I can only offer you , dear colleagues , an open door . - Who 's that ? - Schinder . Protestant ethics committee , anti-smoking group . Specialty ? Forms . All right . Once more ... the B ... 27-500 ... always in duplicate ... with ... the pink carbon copy . Quick ! Inject it quickly ! Can 't you even find a vein ? You gave him immunoglobulin for myasthenia ? - The latest studies indicate ... - Stick to our standards ! Meningitis in 406 needs antibiotics . You 're on call at Christmas . A Mr. Willi called . He 's waiting ... for the panties . Asamoah takes the ball , and bang ! That man has irreversible brain damage , Dr. Hauser . - Blue and pink ! - Why can 't you just give me ... the fucking vial ? I once heard that by showing attention to a patient ... To a vegetable ? Must have been at the university . Tell that woman her husband died . You 're the only doctor here . What do you mean , Willi 's results are " not so great " ? Can 't that damn therapist give precise ... No , it 's just a cold . Mama , wait . Three hours , 45 patients , four minutes each . Everything breaks down if I have to pee . We 're gonna fuck you up , assholes . I 'm the doctor . I know where it hurts . Head trauma in 402 is dead . Examination and death certificate . He 's already done for . Two 36-hour shifts and a weekend . Great ! Dirk , what 's this ? " Muller-LaRousse 's special project . " Research operation . Newest technology ... medicine of the future , career . Only for the Prof and his disciples . How ... I 'm gonna get in ! Right ! Nurse , could someone ... Shiny apples often rotten inside . Wow , two hours . Unbelievable . Dr. Jo ! Lee ! Come and help ? Maybe is very bad . But Dr. Schinder say , child foreigner ... no insurance ... micro-MRI cost lot of money . - And what should I do ? - Her nose bleeds two days now . Machine only for private patient . And too much paperwork . - Nurse Consuelo not have permanent visa . - Child very sick , always cry . There is micro-MRI in 17 . I can 't convince Schinder , and we can 't break in there . No . Only examine . Dr. Jo say so nice words when he came here . Come , please ! We seen a man , the whole time he ... Shit ! Shit ! It 's a cranial fracture ... with subarachnoidal bleeding . We have to operate now ! - Can someone get the endoscope ready ? - I can , Doctor . It 's good that we didn 't wait . - But we can 't just ... - We have to ! Camera working ? Great . Forceps . Not sterile now . Hope we have another one . Good evening . Evening . Systolic pressure , 60 . Pulse , 160 . Patient very unstable . Give her 500 units of plasma expander ! What 's going on ? - Evening . - Good evening . Is Muller-LaRousse still here ? I need to ... No , he is ... Is he still in 17 ? Funny . - I could have sworn ... - No , you stay . I 'll go myself . It looks good now . Now we 'll stop the bleeding . Dr. Schinder is coming ! I 'll try something ... Good evening , Dr. Schinder . You are here ? I no find linen from rooms 405 and 408 . - You know where ? - I don 't . But where is pink form ? I need it . It 's not my responsibility . Dr. Schinder ! Professor , I thought you ... Mr. Hauser ... please come to my office when you 're done . Professor , I know it wasn 't right . But the child had a cranial fracture ! An emergency ! So kick me out 'cause I broke your damn rules ! I read your research project . My project ? Your thesis is , scientifically , rubbish . Of course , you must read MacMillan . - But your idea about acetylcholine ... - But my project will prove ... A man can learn from his mistakes , but only a loser insists on them . I don 't have time to discuss this now ... but come to my place Wednesday evening . We have ... a weekly get-together with like-minded colleagues . John Kershaw is this week 's guest . Kershaw , the neurologist ? The Nobel Prize winner ? Yes ... of course . 1992 . - It could be interesting for you . - What about that operation I ... Rules are for the weak . What do you say ? I knew it . You 're a good doctor . You 're a great nurse . I also study medicine , at home in Philippines . I 'm in Germany to learn machines . The machines from here and the traditions from home ... well together . Maybe you can teach me something . A good heart is important . Heart of the sick person ... and heart of the doctor . ... so we just implanted ... an electrode in the subthalamic zona incerta ... an electrode in the subthalamic zona incerta ... and thus interrupted the tremor by electrical stimulation . That means you did not use any medication . Exactly . The simplest solutions are always the best . It 's already 11 : 30 . That 's enough for today . Thank you , Mr. Kershaw . It was a pleasure to have you here . And as for winning the Nobel Prize , we 'll get there ourselves ! Next week ... Valjean from the Sorbonne will be here . And before the refreshments , brothers ... I would like to introduce you ... to Joachim Hauser . Intern . He has an interesting theory about the acetylcholine problem . Maybe he 'll give us a lecture soon . A gifted young man ! Embarrassing , huh ? Charles is so sweet he doesn 't even notice . Hi . I 'm Viktoria . I 'll introduce you to the group . Group ? The research team . Interns from various departments . We work with Charles . Hagen , plastic surgery ... Wulf , Conny and Alexandra , neurologists ... Kurt , orthopedics , Sven , neurosurgery ... Gregor , our brilliant biomechanic ... and most important of all , anesthesia and biochemistry . Have a seat . I 'm Jo Hauser , Ward 6 . Oh God , Schinder and his lot . A fresh neurosurgeon in the Lodge . We can finally get rid of him ! Lodge ? Anti-Hippocratics . A.A.A. Age Actabile Antihippocrate . " Do the possible . " Anti-Hippocratics ? I thought they had disappeared . Or were outlawed . Outlawed ? - Why didn 't anyone tell me ? - You could have us arrested ! But that incident in Heidelberg ... The crazy love-triangle murders ? The Lodge connection was exaggerated . They never mentioned that he belonged to the automobile club , too ! You don 't play by the rules , either . - Nice job . - Respect . Boring , ethically-controlled research . Forms . A scientist must go beyond rules and boundaries . Dare to be radical . Here in the Lodge you can discuss your ideas ... get advice ... even get financial help . You just have to be successful ... then nobody questions your results . And we are successful ! Charles is a genius . You want to attend an operation tomorrow ? Sure . What exactly do you do in your research group ? That 's wild . Are you serious ? That 's wild . Are you serious ? A 400 % increase in performance ? If your artificial muscles don 't age and don 't tire , that means ... Take off your pants and shoes , and sit on the table . What ? You do want to be part of the group , don 't you ? I don 't know . Why ? Amputations ... polio ... neurological muscle diseases . Charles 'll be the first man since Jesus to make the lame walk again . Tell me ... is this going ... to be an examination or sex ? Both . Let 's hope so . We like to combine the practical with the pleasurable here . Small , medium or large ? No way . Medium will do , I 'd say . Actually ... large . Tell me , colleague ... have you ever had ... really good sex , physically ? That depends on what ... What 's that ? Are you crazy ? What the ... Morning , Dr. Jo . Night shift ? Morning , colleague . Loose pants today ? It was pretty heavy last night . Look at this . I injected you with andromin , here . The red circles are your orgasms . Great numbers ! - Andro what ? - Andromin . Adrenalin to get you going , endorphins to make you happy ... and serotonin to feel good . Developed it myself . And because of that , please fill this out . Medically precise answers . By the way ... do you know where my panties are ? I sent ' em to my brother . A fascinating race , but we 're ahead in the neuromuscular field . A fascinating race , but we 're ahead in the neuromuscular field . Viktoria 's injection ? - Rub baby lotion on your little friend . - Or soak it in herbal tea . The English have interesting results in neurotransmitters . MacMillan . But Charles is altogether the bigger genius . Wulf ! Hey , Jo ! Watch out , the patient might cut you back . What 's up ? He 's always showing off his body . It 's all fake . Wulf already has eight synthetic muscles . We 'll complete his upper armlshoulder area with the triceps . Here . What ? Self-testing . We need young , strong , healthy test subjects . Synthetics work like natural muscles ... but with titanium fibers , silicone , collagens ... synthetic myofilaments . We implant them ... and connect them to the same nerves . - You can move them with your muscles . - Or instead of them ! You 're thinking of your brother ? - How did you know ? - Spinal atrophy , genetic muscle disease . Father , brother ? One gets it , the other gets lucky . My father died of it . And to see it slowly destroy Willi ... It isn 't fair ! It wouldn 't be any fairer if you had gotten it . To fight for a cure would be a just cause for you . Who knows ? Nothing is impossible ... and at the end of the day , nothing is incurable . That 's why I 'm here . - It 's no coincidence that I ... - Right . It 's no coincidence that you 're here . We 've been watching you . - Where are we going ? - Forward ! Local anesthesia , ready . The patient is ready . Implicate yourself , too . If anything happens , we 'll both lose our licenses . That little jerk-off . Most have their synthetics in their armlshoulder area . But Hagen ... has them in his hands . It was tricky work , but the result is great . Alexandra has them in her legs . - She can crack nuts with her butt . - And Kurt ? - In his legs , too ? - Guess . You 've got some catching up to do . Hey , a soccer player ? Sure . MSV Junior League . I was top scorer in 1994 . Very good . A winner ! - I like to have winners in my group . - Working with Charles makes you one ! Here comes Svenni Pooh . Hello , Pooh Bear ! Come on ! Hagen , run with me in front ? You wanna be in the group ? They 've written me off already ? - I 'm not pushing you out ? - No , you want a career . Like Benny . Early test phase . " Sacrifice to science . " Right . The junkie who killed himself ? That does suck . But you don 't have to worry about me . You trying to get me off the project ? We have to talk . It 's important . You 're in danger . We 're all in danger . Benny didn 't kill himself . Somebody killed him . Hey , Svenni , what 's up ? - Where are we going ? - You okay ? Sure . Where we going ? - Forward ! - Forward ! Hey , Manni ... why did they take away your bronchial irrigation ? I thought you were destined for bigger things than ordinary patients . - Why did you label him as terminal ? - We have rules here . I 'm not accusing LaRousse , but ... - Unethical tests are no petty crime . - It 's unfair ! Manni 's not ... - Muller-LaRousse has privileges ... - He has no chance ! If it goes wrong , he 's finished , and so are you ! Are you listening ? He 's so young ! Here ... the most recent results . His vital functions have worsened dramatically . If you had any idea ... I have my principles ... no matter how boring that may seem to you . It 's the only way for me to handle this job . Do you understand ? I 'm talking about your future . Don 't sell your soul . It would be a shame . Don 't resist with your own muscles . That 's right . Exactly . Good . Very good . We 've implanted a chip in the intumescentia cervicalis ... which we can access externally . It controls all muscles ... below the sixth vertebra ... the natural ones as well . We call it the CNE : Central Neurological Enhancer . We can externally control ... and synchronize muscles and synthetics . Turn it to maximum speed . It 's pretty funny . Here is the chemical analysis . You can see that we still need ... to add muscle-stimulating hormones . Raise the endorphins to 2.1 units ... and adrenalin to 1.4 . We 'll do the normal training routine . You know the drill , Wulf . What do you think ? Incredible ! You will revolutionize ... That 's not what I meant . Where do you want a synthetic implant ? I mean ... is it possible ... everywhere ? And can I fly afterwards ? My name is Joachim Hauser , born November 27 , 1974 . I declare that I am sound of mind ... and I request the calf operation ... although it is not medically necessary . It 's all top secret ! But it 's completely new . A revolution ! Will it heal anyone ? It 's research . You can 't do everything with Hula-Hula medicine . Now we connect the CNE with the tractus corticospinalis . Please , Hagen . This is my one big chance to play in the big league . So ... we take away this one . Suction ! I 've heard it all before . It 's only temporary . Is the initialization running ? And now the battery . Can we trust him ? You mean Jo ? Our new superstar ? - He 's not as great as Charles makes out . - An athlete . You 've seen his reflexes ? We need good bodies for the tests . I don 't trust him . I don 't know why , but ... Don 't worry . I 'll make sure nobody else goes crazy . It 's been one week since the operation ? - Don 't resist with your own muscle . - Amazing ! - I 'm not doing anything ! - Exactly . Steroids to build up the parallel musculature , these against rejection ... synthetic endorphin , adrenalin ... - Dopamine , serotonin ... - Why the kidney drugs ? For the side effects of the others . And these for the pharmaceutical tests . Great results . Potential performance is already ... - 230 % . - What ? So can I use my legs again normally ? To play soccer , maybe ? We 're all big soccer fans , right , boys ? Of course ! This morning . Paula Henning . Two years ago , she took the whole Heidelberg Lodge to court . Now she 's a cop . Organized crime division . She 's the big Anti-Hippocratics hunter . Sven , that bastard ! - How dare he ! - Our experiments aren 't approved . If he exposes us now , just before our breakthrough ... We must stop him ! He 'll destroy us all ! Maybe he needs to be ... taught a lesson ... once and for all . But what ... Are you saying ... But I can 't just ... You know I love you ... like a son . But if it 's too much for you ... I could always ask another . Jo ... Maybe we should ... I am always prepared to ... Take Gregor with you . He 's good for this sort of thing . Don 't tell me the details . Amazing . So you went ahead and did it . Sven ! Are you crazy ? Want to join the Lodge , too ? If they 'll take me . Rubbing shoulders with some bigwigs can 't hurt . That 's what I thought , too . This is no Rotary Club . It 's an international conspiracy ! I have to get to my game . Listen ! They killed Benny . Ask Fred Richter . I don 't know any Fred . They destroyed his brain ! LaRousse is a criminal . I have all the proof ! He 'll destroy you , too ! He 's a demon ! You got me at a bad time . Jo , you have to help me . You 're the only one not brainwashed ! He 's killing us all ! I can 't stand it ! It has to stop . You have to help me . Listen , we 'll meet here . Okay ? Like , between 8 : 00 and 9 : 00 . You can wait here . TV , fridge ... They 've all been seduced ! LaRousse is a demon ! We have to fight him . Together ! What 's this all about ? Guys , I 'm a doctor . I 've dissected more dicks than you 've shot goals . I thought that athletes had good bodies ! - What a sad bunch ! - Let 's go . Believe me , you 'll collapse otherwise . I 'll inject some adrenalin and neurocholine to stimulate the synthetic . What 'll happen ? Foul ! Open your eyes , ref ! We 're doctors . I 'll take care of him . I 'm a doctor . Stand back , please . Thank you . It 's okay now . It doesn 't hurt anymore . The game can go on . Felix ... Are you okay ? We 'll have seven beers . Fuck you , jerk-off . I was here first . With a hand like that , he can hardly be a jerk-off . I 've only used andromin for sex . But it seems to work for soccer , too . We 're bored ! You 're winning 12 to 0 . We 're leaving . Come on , Jo ! I get to join the Lodge . Initiation 's tonight ! - Congratulations . - Thanks . Things are moving very fast with you . Sorry , we can 't come . We have to work . We 're going to the Splendid first . Sven 's waiting for me , ' cause ... He 's stressed out . I should look in on him . Sven called , he ... - He 'll call you tomorrow . - He wanted to lie down and ... He shoots too much adrenalin , and then he 's a bit ... Really ? Great ! - Have a good time ! - Take care . Thanks . You , too . - Where are we going ? - Forward ! What are you doing ? We are going to the Splendid . Come with us . Come on , what are we going to do ? This is Jo Hauser . Could you do me a favor ? Dr. Jo ? Is Dr. Jo not back ? Dr. Lemke ? Dr. Hauser called . He can 't come . He 'll meet you in 17 . Okay , thanks . How are you ? - How 're you doing ? - Jeez , guys . And you ? Do you guys know where Jo is ? How are your synthetics ? They 're okay . You 're behind on your program , you know . I know . So ? What do we have here ? Calf ... thigh ... No implants for the last six months . I didn 't get around to it . You don 't believe in us anymore , do you ? Of course I do ! That 's okay . Let 's be frank with each other . Sure . That 's why I wanted to talk to Jo . To help a young brother along . That 's okay . You 're a good guy . Sure . You know what ? I think you 're a piece of shit . A dirty little traitor shit . Okay . - Great . What now ? - Endorphins . Happy hormones . - Good against pain . - I know that . Listen , that 's 5 units . That 's too much , Gregor . Stop it , please . Stay here , Sven ! I want to finish our conversation . I feel so fucking good . Hagen , stop this shit . Man , this isn 't funny . Dear brothers ... dear colleague Hauser . At your age I found the rituals of the academic world ridiculous , too . But ... let us not forget that here , today , a man ... binds himself for life . But I believe in Charles ... you know . He is a real genius . And I believe in the group ... He won 't walk and keeps falling over ! ... in the project . We all have to make sacrifices ... because we want to achieve greatness . Gregor , stop it ! And we can 't let you ruin it . You wanted to betray us , right ? I know you did . God damn it , Sven ! You know that you 're guilty . Stop it ! Let it be given to you ... the power to judge the worth of a life . Ego spondeo . Don 't fall over . Let it be given to you ... the power over life and death . Ego spondeo . I swear . Just a lesson , you idiot ! Let that be a lesson to you . Don 't betray your family ! Piece of shit ! You enter the Lodge by your blood ... you can only leave it by your blood . Enter now this family . We welcome you , brother Joachim . The Lodge needs people like you . My God ! You killed him ! We did , Hagen ! We did our duty and executed a traitor ! He was worthless . We can 't let years of work be ruined by such a piece of shit . - What have you done ? - Pull yourself together ! He had it coming . Let 's go downstairs . The synthetics have to come out . I 'll do the examination , you sign the death certificate , okay ? What do you say ? Have you heard ? We knew the English were working on this , too ... - But ... - What ? The Royal Academy . They developed something like CNE and they 're using it to treat epilepsy . - Lf that ... - Sven ! Damn it , Sven is dead ! I know . It 's terrible . He was weak . Well done , colleagues ! You want to know who 'll win the Nobel Prize ? Do you ? Not us ! All this is shit ! Too slow . No one is prepared to make real sacrifices . " The pain . " " The hormones . " Your mediocrity disgusts me ! We want to be world-class ! Global players . We have what it takes ! We 're verging on a breakthrough ! We could change the world . But we have to publish as soon as possible ... otherwise it was all for nothing . Forward ! Everyone will now have their muscle groups completed with synthetics . We increase pharmaceutical dosages to maximum . We need definite results as soon as possible . And we 'll begin Phase 2 immediately ! But we still need the results from ... Should we wait to buy them at the druggist 's ? Leave if you want ! - You know I am ... - Anyone else ? I am the first to volunteer . Shall we go for a run ? Hauser ? Just the two of us . Parallel synthetics are for sissies . We must get clear proof . We must remove the natural muscles ! Out ! Ballast overboard ! Phase 2 . But that 'd be forever . - Irreversible . - Exactly . That is a statement . Forever ! - But my legs , I can 't just ... - A doctor must make sacrifices ... that 's how I always understood it . I want you to help my brother . We need a fit body for the first test . All right . If you can deliver us usable results . You 'll play soccer together again . Something like , " I can 't stand it , I have to end it . " And he talked ... about Benny . The guy who also killed himself . I feel so guilty . But now the police ? For a suicide ? This is just routine ... Sorry ... it 's not routine . Sven Lemke wanted to expose an Anti-Hippocratic conspiracy . He wanted to give me proof and even get someone from the Lodge ... Dr. Henning is from the ... federal police . According to the statements , Dr. Lemke was a suicide risk . A typically overworked intern ... combined with psychological stress . He was full of drugs . There are no indications ... Do you like being here at the clinic ? Do you like it here ? - Dr. Henning , any further questions ? - No , thank you . I 'd say you can go , Dr. Hauser . If you need anything at all , feel free to come to me . Hey , Dr. Jo ! It 's great here ! You ever tried these meatballs ? Thanks for picking him up , Lee . Lee is my girlfriend now . If you don 't want her ... You don 't mind cripples , do you ? Do you have the results ? I mean , how are you ? One arm ... is going a little crazy ... but as long as I can do this ... Never say that again ! Understand ? Tomorrow we 'll start the tests ... and a special therapy for you . I 'm so happy you 're here . Sorry about that . Fantastic work ! Jo ... I envy you ! You 're making medical history . This is going to be great ... really great . We calculate that you will run ... 60 kilometers an hour . Long distance . I 'm so proud of my superman ! You fool ! Don 't you understand anything ? - You told me that I should ... - Stop your faggy whining ! I hate it ! - Professor , I cannot allow you ... - To call you queer ? Did somebody say Hagen 's a fag ? Stop staring at me like a cow ! Pump him back up ! I think I 've never been in love before ... and I haven 't even slept with Charles . I need more endorphins . It will be okay ... He 's so charismatic . I know you don 't have an endless supply . Especially now , he 's showing his weak side . Can 't you make an exception ? Sorry . Get yourself some morphine . - What ? - Morphine ... or even heroin . Chemically the same as endorphins . But I can 't just ... We 're all injecting something . Of course , only during the course of the experiment . Monitored . Everyone envies you for being the first to reach Phase 2 ! I 'm afraid . Has everyone tried the new serotonin formula ? Any side effects ? I expect the results of your self-tests tomorrow . Are we doing any operations in the next few days ? The pressure on all of us is enormous . Dr. Hauser ? About the Anti-Hippocratics ... A fraternity of doctors which has become an international cartel . The Lodges have infiltrated the entire medical-pharmaceutical system . In the German health system , over 230 billion euros ... Are you listening to me ? A new drug costs half a billion euros to develop . That 's a lot of money . Stand still ! The Lodge will stop at nothing . You are being used . They will kill you ! Here , look . Benny , supposedly a junkie , but we believe ... Leave me alone ! - What 's this got to do with me ? - You 're a member , aren 't you ? Listen . The Lodge is a criminal organization . You can join our witness program . - But I can 't . - You must ! I 'm certain Sven Lemke was murdered because he wanted to cooperate ! What do you know about Fred Richter ? Sooner or later the Lodge will get busted , and you will , too ! A therapist ? Some guy who feels up my legs . Maybe the woman in Duisburg was too old , but ... Did I mention you look like shit ? Thanks . I know . What do you need all that for ? That 's more than I take . It 's temporary . - Lee says you ... - Don 't you start . I know what I 'm doing , okay ? Sorry . Forget it . I already lost . Want to play again ? You okay ? Man , my arm won 't ... Everything is so fucked up . I 'll fix it ! Willi , trust me . Not much longer . Just hold on . Joachim Hauser ... born November 27 , 1974 . I declare that I am sound of mind ... and that I specifically requested this operation ... - Even though it is medically unnecessary . - Good . Careful . Spinal anesthetic . You can watch your operation if you want . Wulf ... please call Charles . We 're ready . You get along with the professor ? You should watch out . He doesn 't like it ... if you get too close to him . It 's fine . Charlie even asked me to become his personal assistant . He asked you ? By the way , it 's " Charles . " He hates " Charlie . " Ready ? The anesthetic hasn 't set in yet ! You crazy asshole ! You did that on purpose ! Try me ! Get back ! Are you crazy ? I 'll kill him ! I thought the spinal was working . We can forget about him now . I 'll get a compress . It 's not what you think . You 're addicted to drugs . Are you crazy ? It 's for the project ! For the project ! What the hell ? - What 's the deal ? Some Chinese girl ... - Filipino ! Not Chinese ! I do the drug administration here . I must report this . You want to ruin everything ? Just ' cause I took some stuff ? I 'm fine . I have the chance of my life . Your heart 's sick . Stop it ! My heart 's sick . Bullshit ! Who do you think you are ? You 're like all the others ! - Why are you doing this to me ? - I 'm afraid for you . Dr. Benny 's records . The junkie ? Junkie like you . Dr. Benny was my friend . You are my friend . Benny is dead . The experiments on Dr. Benny are all documented here . These are Charles ' personal records . How did you get these ? I don 't know what you 're doing ... but stop it . It 's destroying you . How do I look ? My name is Benjamin Sachs ... intern at the Berlin Clinic . I declare that I am of sound mind ... We could increase the dosage earlier ... following procedures ... Hemoglobin reception ... I request the shoulder operation ... Increase of endorphin concentrate although not medically necessary . Since Benny 's tolerance is not exhausted , following operation ... I can 't sleep well . Can we stop the choline tests at least ? ... agree to the operation on my thorax , I agree to the operation on my arms ... Further operations would seem possible and useful . Spasms ... disturbed vision , digestive problems , cold sweats , trouble sleeping ... Despite various complications , an increased dosage of ... The unfortunate epileptic seizure of August 17 brought valuable insights . Temporary paralysis ... Due to the extreme pressure on the natural muscle tissue ... - I 'm afraid ! - A breakthrough is near ! We are preparing to start Phase 2 . In animal testing ... you increase the dosage until the animal collapses ... till it dies . It 's called bio-tolerance ... in animals . And in humans ? At home , in Hula-Hula land ... it 's murder . I wasn 't claiming that ... But Charles would never ... What 's wrong ? I can 't ... - The infusion ! What did you give him ? - I don 't know . Orderly ! New medicine from Prof. Muller-LaRousse ! - Stay calm . Are you okay ? - Yes . Synthetics ! Endorphins , 3 units , hurry ! Damn it ! A CNE . - Fucking intern ! - What ? Sorry , Doctor ... I meant that head case . Fred Richter ! Dr. Fred was intern in neurosurgery before accident . Didn 't you know ? Manni ? - Manfred Richter ! - Assistant to Dr. Muller-LaRousse . Motorcycle accident with Dr. Gregor . Manni 's alleged accident . If you look carefully , no epidural bleeding or trauma . Just isolated cuts . Muller-LaRousse must have surgically destroyed his brain . The infusion gave him the rest . Manfred Richter found out about it . Benny 's death was no accident . It was planned as part of the testing . The Anti-Hippocrats are conducting lethal experiments on humans ! Muller-LaRousse heads the Lodge , but they 're all in on it : The group , Prof. Sturm , Prof. Phillipp . These are serious accusations you are making . I 'm shocked to hear this . Didn 't you swear to silence ? What ? You name names ... of Lodge brothers ... betray professional and personal secrets . I 'm glad you 're here . We were just talking about you . Before you do anything rash ... police , press ... I don 't think the evidence will exist anymore . Have you heard ? Poor Fred is dead . A relief for the poor boy . That can 't be ... I should know . I signed the death certificate . Heart failure . Not unusual in ... terminal cases . What did you think ? That we 'd let some intern ... ruin years of work ? Someone gave him endorphins . - Know who you 're dealing with ? - Maybe it was you . A neuro-trauma . The project must go on . We have contracts ... worth millions ! Can you explain it all to Schinder 's ethics commission ? The Lodge has great power to destroy its enemies . I offer you my hand one last time . What do you want in life ? To be a hack like Schinder , or to explore the future with us ? Medicine . Change the world . You could be one of the best . The Lodge is the way to get there . Department heads in Germany earn 5 or 10 million per year . Don 't be a fool . Accept my offer . He 's here . Dr. Hauser , you must ... What 's up , man ? Take an aspirin . Come back tomorrow . - But ... - I 'm a doctor . Do what I say ! We 'll find you an appointment . Come , please . Help me . I have to get out of here with Willi . It 's a matter of ... life and death . Believe me . But please help us . I have a friend in security . I 'll call . Trust him . Have a rest . You look beat . Alexandra , get all the Lodge brothers together . Gregor , take the front door . Don 't let him leave . Yes , we 're here ... in Neurology , Ward 14 . I 'll keep him here , and ... I mean , we 'II ... be waiting for you . I 'll get all of you bastards ! Understand ? I 'll get all of you ! Jerk-off ! I have a family . I just wanted a chance to succeed ! Asshole ! I 'll explain later . Pretend to sleep . They 'll think I 'm a doctor ? Cool . Shut up and wait till I 'm back . Hey , Jo ... come back , okay ? Eleven units of endorphin . Too much , even for a junkie like you ! How could you betray us ? We loved you . Charles and I , we wanted ... Shiny apple rotten inside ? Thanks ! Thank you ! Air very bad . Interns ! Berlin Hospital , Emergency Room , please . This is Dr. Phillipp from the Moabit Clinic . Pass me your superior , please . Make it snappy ! He must be there somewhere ! He has to be brought here immediately . Then find him ! That 's Phillipp , spelled " Ph. " Exactly . That must be him . Typical . There . It 's him . Call central and tell them he 's here . As if the fuck-ups were our fault . Can you say one sentence without using the word " fuck " ? But it 's fucking true . Carbon copy 's missing , too . Really ? Fuck ! I need something for the pain . - Morphine , something . - Don 't worry . We take out bad implant . They 're after me ! They want to kill me ! He 's in Building 2 ... Room 114 . Hey , wait . Can I help you ? Would you like something to drink ? Tea or coffee ? Too close to spine . Too dangerous . Where am I ? What is that ? Jo from Duisburg ... is the first man ... who can sleep with my bed . Good against bad spirits in your head . Bad what ? " Bad spirits . " A nice way to say , " withdrawal symptoms . " I 'm starting to believe in good spirits . I told you he had some Thai pussy . What do you think you 're ... The pain is killing me ! What will I tell my father ? We can 't turn back , Hagen . Charles is a genius . - The group will stick together now . - Charles will be here soon . - We 're close to a breakthrough . - He 'll know what to do . - It will be a big success . - He 'll explain . It 'll be a sensation . Hagen , are you stupid ? Don 't you see that he 's using us and killing us ? We 're lab rats ... who are tortured and then fill out forms ! We all have to make sacrifices . We wanted to be good doctors . We thought ... some unauthorized experiments would be okay , but not murder ! Listen ! Muller-LaRousse had Benny and Fred killed . You don 't understand camaraderie ! You are scum ! We 're moving forward ! People , where are we going ? Man , you guys are the saddest fucks I 've ever seen ! We don 't care about that . We want to do research . Fred had an accident . Get him out of here ! What do you think ? We 're doing scientific tests . We need the results . Okay , Benny got fucked up . Wulf won 't last long either . Just look at the degenerate material ... we have to work with . Charles talks about a new species . A technically perfect man . Able to survive the future . The true master race ! - Where is he ? - Finally , Charles ! - We didn 't know ... - Where is he ? With Gregor , on the roof . We thought ... Are you all retarded ? The place is full of cops ... and you repeat that stupid trick ? Get Hauser and that stupid butcher and bring them back ! Finally ! Dr. Kirchberg . You must ... Hello ? What 's going on ? Hauser 's locked himself in and refuses to come out . He keeps talking rubbish . Viktoria , we are so close ! We belong together . I need you ... so much . You have to take care of the Filipino . She knows too much . An overdose . Something . It must be untraceable . No great step for man ... but one giant leap for you , brother . So you 're the little Thai girl . Dr. Hauser 's little Filipino , right ? He 's been very naughty lately . Shit ! You know Charles ? Charles is so wonderful . Come here . What 's that ? The battery ! I 'm gonna kill the cripple ! It will be wonderful . You 'll see . You 'll be so relaxed and happy ... that your heart will forget to beat . So happy ! All the pain is forgotten . How can I tell my father I 'm barred from practicing ? You don 't know what it 's like . We 've always been doctors in my family . Winners ! They used to do this ... to aggressive mental cases ... to , let 's say ... calm them down . Long term . Quiet . Lobotomy . You never understood greatness . Why should I care about making a cripple ... into an invalid ? Viktoria , begin the anesthesia . It is so clean ... so medical ... and practically undetectable . I thought we could deactivate the speech center ... coagulate the thalamus , and then ... go for the nerve core . Now ... Careful ... Nasal septum ... Charles , stop it . I can 't take it anymore . It 's not worth all this . We 'll make a new team . We need young , enthusiastic ... healthy colleagues ! Hagen ! Viktoria ! My best assistants ! We will ... I 'll kill him . We were so close . They mustn 't humiliate you . I 'll save you from them . So happy ... Our work is just beginning : a network of corruption and dependencies . The usual . Your plans ? Accident clinic , Bochum . I applied for a research grant . Research . Good . At the end of the day ... nothing is incurable . I 've never been so certain before . I thought that once , myself . Okay . We still need your statement . Take good care of yourself . And beware of doctors . Well ? Much better . But I 'm in a lot of pain . Need an injection ? What 's this ? A secret Filipino recipe ? For pain . Aspirin and water . What about affection ? Human contact ? Good spirits ? Very important . Should I call a doctor ? The tragic chapter of Muller-LaRousse ... is now closed in every way ... except for those grotesque accusations against me . But they should be taken care of shortly . For the good of our hospital , we should return to normality . So I would like ... to fill the position of Department Head as soon as possible ... and I 'll be presenting my suggestion to the council next week . I 'll be open with you . The character and integrity of our candidate ... must be impeccable . I 'm very happy that you are interested ... and I 'll keep you informed . Oh , yes . There 's an informal weekly get-together ... of scientifically like-minded colleagues , if you have the time . Members of the council will be there . Could you come Wednesday evening ? Wednesday evening ? Wednesday evening ? I could manage that .

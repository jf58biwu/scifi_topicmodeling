 Whoo ! Giant space robot , this is Captain Fry ... of the U.S. S. Planet Express ship . We come in peace . Tough luck ! Well , we destroyed the toy spaceship . Now what are we going to do ? Hey , look ! The keys to the real spaceship . Do you think we should ? Yes , I do . Leela , have you seen the keys to the spaceship ? Uh , I must have left them on board . Oh , well ... I mean , what ! Relax , the ship 's not going anywhere . I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether . Ooh ! Oh , no . This isn 't good for Zoidberg . Whoo ! Yeah ! Whoa ! Hey , Fry ... I 'm steering with my ass . That 's the best thing I ever saw . That was great ! And no one suspects a thing . And that 's how we learned our lesson . You 've gone too far this time . All three of you . What did I do ? You left the keys in the ignition . I mean , look at those two . Wasn 't it obvious what would happen ? Yeah , Leela . We 're all very disappointed in you . I should fire you three right now . But I 'm just not that cold-hearted . You 're all fired . Good-bye , friends . I 'll miss you . Good riddance to them . Now Zoidberg is the popular one . Yes , yes , let 's all talk to Zoidberg . Hey ... So , Zoidberg ... what 's new ? Oh , you know ... What are we supposed to do for money ? All I 've got is my Frequent Taffy Eater 's card ... my first mustache ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend ... Michelle , and that ski instructor ... she was just friends with . Pardon me , brother . Care to donate ... to the Anti-Mugging You fund ? Ow ! We don 't need to beg , Bender . For God 's sake , we 're not veterans . Well , what do you suggest ? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant back ? That 's the dumbest thing I ever heard . No , we can get jobs . But we just had jobs . Fortunately , I still have our old career chips . Our what ? Career chips . You remember ... they assign you the job you 're best at . I tried to give you one and you ran away ? It 's how we met ? And then what happened ? Just give me your hand . Ow ! Baby . Ow ! I 'd like to reapply for my old job . Counseling defrostees and assigning them careers . Oh , I was hoping you would come back . I even saved your poster ... of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays . Monday monkey lives for the weekend , sir . Just put your hand under the scanner ... so I can verify your career chip . Calcutta , we have a problem . Delivery boy ? I must have mixed up the chips . It 's a simple ... Oh , here 's our cryogenic counselor . - Do you like Mondays ? - They 're okay . Then we 'll have to redecorate your office . How do you feel about it ... helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary ? Hey ! Let 's see what it says about me . Welcome aboard , sir . Remember , when the tube opens , say ... " Welcome to the world of tomorrow ! " Hey , I was frozen . I think I know what people want to hear ... when they first wake up . Bathroom 's that way . So , while you 're on the probulator , tell me what brings you to the future . Oh , well , I wanted to meet Shakespeare ... and I figured that time was cyclical . Nope , straight line . Ah ! The probulator 's done . Oh , that wasn 't so bad . Oh , wait , it hasn 't started yet . Okay , it 's about to start . Welcome to the future , human slave . Ah , relax , chum . I 'm not really a giant fly . I 'm a horrible robot ! Kill all humans ! Dear God ! He 's having a heart attack ! They 'll probably find a cure for that in the future . We have a cure for it now ! Oh , good , then you won 't mind if I use this . Nothing like a power nap . Flies , flies and gorillas ! Stay beautiful , dollface . Ooh , that probulator sure knows how to please a man . So , what 's for lunch ? I ordered a pizza . Pizza delivery for ... I.C. Wiener . Yeah , very funny . Now cough up the $ 12.95 . Sorry , but if it 's not here in half an hour , it 's free . It 's only been 23 minutes . Well , uh , I 've got 33 minutes . It 's only been ... 23 minutes , you dumb cannoli . You got a problem ? We can take it outside . Okay , I 'll fight the box . I think I can take him . Fry , just pay me . I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform . 35 , you stupid meatball ! Who should we unfreeze next ? No . No ! Oh , my God ! It 's Pauly Shore ! All right ! Mr. Shore , I loved you in Bio-Dome . You sure caused some trouble in that bubble ! Rest assured ... If it rhymes , I can cause trouble in it . Hey , now that you 're in the future ... you can go live in an actual bio-dome . An unattractive prospect . While researching for the role ... I ran computer simulations demonstrating incontrovertibly ... that the whole bio-enclosure concept ... is fundamentally flawed ... be it expressed via dome , sphere , cube ... or even the stately tetrahedron ... buddy ! Oh . So , how did you wind up getting frozen ? Well , while filming Encino Man ... my intellectual curiosity Cryogenics was peaked ... and I resolved to freeze the weasel . The weasel ! Ha-ha ! Hey , listen , Skippy . I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood ... for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty 2 . How come I 'm not there ? I woke you up early , so we could hang out and do stuff . Like what ? I love this job . Me , too . Show time ! I 'll pretend to be dying of space plague . Boo ? Michelle ! Oh , my God . Fry ? Is it really you ? I don 't know . Is it really you ? What do you mean you don 't know ? Are you you or not ? Who wants to know ? Oh , Fry , it is you ! Boo ! I don 't get it , Michelle . The last time I saw you , you were doing great . You had just dumped me and were well on your way ... to getting your life back on track . Why 'd you freeze yourself ? Oh , Fry , after you left ... things took a turn for the worse . I got married . I 'm sorry . His name was Charles . He attended a law school so prestigious ... the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsburg . I put him through law school ... by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs . Sorry . But soon after Charles graduated ... our marriage ran into difficulties . Uh , sorry . Desperately depressed ... I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain ... a carnival . Unfortunately , a corn dog bone ... got lodged in the control panel of the Spizzler ... and I had to ride it for eight hours . Sorry . But it did give me a chance to think . I 'm sorry . And I remembered the last time I was truly happy . When I was with you . Oh . So you froze yourself to come look for me ? No , I did it to get a fresh start . I didn 't know what had happened to you . No one did . The police were going to conduct a search ... but your parents felt ... it was a waste of taxpayer money . That 's the same reason ... they kept me out of school . So , no one even cared that I was gone ? Not really . Except for one person . Who was it ? Everything is so different . Not everything . There 's still a roach problem . Ew . Ugh . Nowadays , people aren 't interested in art ... that 's not tattooed on fat guys . I 'm on loan from the Louvre . Ow ! Please , Professor ... give us our jobs back . We deserve another chance . Yeah . And if you won 't give me another chance ... perhaps you 'd give one to ... Og , Gorilla Emperor of Earth . Sorry , Og . But I 've got a new crew . So , how was your delivery to Fantasy planet ... where everyone 's fantasies come to life ? - Great . - Organized . For one beautiful night ... I knew what it was to be a grandmother . Subjugated , yet honored . You see , Og ... everything 's running smoothly . And with Fry fired ... I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out ... without him eating the pieces . Forget about Fry . You could hire us back and he 'd never have to know . Hey , guys . Oh , uh , hey , Fry . So , as Leela was saying ... Fry can go shove ... Ow ! I 'm glad you 're all here . I wanted to introduce you ... to my on-again , off-again girlfriend ... of the past thousand years ... Michelle . Michelle , this is Leela . This is Bender . The professor . Hermes and Amy . Nice to meet you . And this is Dr. Zoidberg . Dating your ex , Fry ? Have you lost all self-respect ? All what ? This can only end badly , Fry . Kids , a house ... A home invasion by a former roommate . But things are different this time . Before , she was demanding and possessive . But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time . There you go , dearies . It 's a relief to meet you , Amy . I 'm just having a hard time ad justing ... to all the strange stuff here in the future . I 'm from Mars . I feel so out of place here . I don 't understand why Fry fits in so well . Probably because he didn 't fit in back in your time . That 's true . But I used to fit in really well . Then good luck , sister . Don 't take this the wrong way , Fry ... but your friends are a bunch of freaks . Yeah . They 're great , huh ? I just don 't belong here . I don 't know anyone . I can 't find a vanishing cream ... that doesn 't make me actually vanish . I don 't even have a job . Oh , right . I was supposed to assign you a job . Let me just get your career chip installed . Hold out your palm . What are you scared of ? It 's just like getting your hand pierced . This world is horrible . Let 's start over , Fry . We 'll go someplace where all we have is each other . Ooh . Romantic . I 'll tell Bender to meet us there . It 's not a there ... it 's a then . The future . Whoa , whoa , girl . I thought you were talking about one of those motels ... where the bed is shaped like stuff . I love you . Don 't you love me ? Well , sure . To the extent a man can love a woman . But this seems like a big step . Fry , why must you analyze everything ... with your relentless logic ? Nothing matters but our love . You 're right . Let 's do this now and let 's never regret it . Michelle , I don 't regret this ... but I both rue and lament it . The year 4000 is severely disappointing . I miss the year 3000 , when life was simple ... and brains flew through space ... and everyone ate lasers . It 's not that bad . Fate brought us together , and now fate brought us here . No , you brought us here . Whine some more , Fry . I really find that attractive in a man . Now , come on , build us a shelter . All right . Fine . Everything else sucks . At least we can have a nice place to live . Whoo ! There . You expect me to live in a tiny , little hole ? It 'd be deeper , but I 'm standing on a gopher . Hmm . Hmm . Oh , look ! Some little kids . They 'll save us . We 're saved ! I 'm Butch , leader of this place . I took your hole and you can 't do nothing about it . Okay . Mighty sir , we have nowhere to go . Could we please join your society ? Well ... all right . But no interfering with our grand works . I tell ya , that Butch runs a pretty good civilization . I think I 'll enjoy serving under him . Uh ! You know your problem , Fry ? You 're not ambitious . You should be chief . What do I need ? Ulcers ? But I want power . I 'm tired of the chief 's girlfriend lording it over me ... with her fancy coyote hide . All right , all right . If it 'll make you happy , I 'll overthrow society . On what grounds do you challenge my authority ? Well , I 'm older than you . I can beat you up . Yeah , I bet he could . He 's got arm hair . All right , Grandpa , there 's only one way to settle this . Death-rolling ! What 's death-rolling ? It 's like skateboarding . Except half the time , someone dies . Oh , so it 's a little safer than skateboarding . Last one holding the bandanna is the new leader . My mother always said you were a loser , Fry . Now get out there and prove her wrong . Beth said that ? Ahad . Steim . Shalosh ! It 's cool . Back off ! My knee , I scraped it . Aw , poor little guy . Let me just take a look at ... Ah-ha ! I won ! I 'm the new chief ! I 'm the tallest and I weigh the most ! Hand it over , you giant idiot . Hey , Butch , your mom 's here . Aw , man . Come on , kids ! You 're late for Hebrew school ! I don 't wanna go . Every Monday and Wednesday , it 's the same thing . I find this postapocalyptic wasteland very confusing . Seriously , I 'm weirded out . That 's because you 're a loser . You were a loser in the year 2000 ... and you 're a loser in the year 4000 . Yeah , but in the year 3000 I had it all : Several friends , a low-paying job ... a bed in a robot 's closet . I envied no man . But you wrecked everything . Quit standing up for yourself , Fry . When we get back to the hole , we are going to have ... a long , boring talk about our relationship . Oh , yeah ? ! Well , listen to this ! I 'm leaving you . There must be people somewhere . Yes ! Footprints ! And handprints ? But ... what 's happening ? Fry ! Thank God we found you . Leela , what are you guys doing here ... in the year 4000 ? It 's not the year 4000 . You were only frozen for two days . Uh , by the way , I broke your bed . You were in Pauly Shore 's tube ... and they were delivering it to his movie screening . But when they noticed ... that you weren 't him , they chucked you in a ditch . So you 're saying these aren 't the decaying ruins ... of New York in the year 4000 ? You wish . You 're in Los Angeles . But there was this gang of ten-year-olds with guns . Exactly . You 're in L.A. But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other . That 's L.A. For you . But the air is green ... and there 's no sign of civilization whatsoever . He just won 't stop with the social commentary . And the people are all phonies . No one reads . Everything has cilantro on it . Michelle , baby . It 's not working out , Fry . ' Tis better to have loved and lost , n 'est-ce pas ? That 's it . I 've had it with women . From now on , I 'm concentrating on my career . Can I have my old job back ? Why , I 've forgotten why I even fired you . 'Cause he destroyed your business , your home ... and all your possessions . Oh , that 's right . Get lost !

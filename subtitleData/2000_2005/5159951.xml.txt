 Previously on " The 4400 " . We 're not sure what happened . Something 's out there . The light has gone and thousands of people have appeared . Diana Skouris , Tom Baldwin . You 'll be one of the teams investigating what happened to the returnees . We 're letting them go . We have no right to hold them . I 'm Warren Lytell . HomeSec mentioned I was coming . I 'm here to clean up your mess . There 's gonna be a change around here . Be part of it or get swept aside . I 'll provide a safe haven for any 4400 . You 'll be our first residents . - I 'm in love with Richard . - Why would I break you up ? If you 're on the job , I feel safe . So does the baby . Two happy residents . That 's a start . Maia Rutledge , aged eight . Disappeared in ' 46 . She makes predictions . Once they come true , she 's removed from quarantine by one of our field agents . You can 't bring Maia back to school any more . We have to consider the other students . - It 'll be OK . - It 's not OK . Somebody will make everything better . Next case , Shawn Farrell , aged 17 . Disappeared in April of 2001 . It 's a little thin . Me breaking up with Danny is not about you . OK . I need to ask you a few questions . I don 't know what happened . I just put my hands on him . Woke up ... Don 't touch me . I recognise you but I don 't know who you are . - What are you doing ? - I 'm looking . - For what ? - For me . I finally understand . They 're not the strangers . I am . I 'm not Kyle Baldwin . Kyle . I 'm not Kyle . - Then who are you ? - I don 't know . - I need more screens . - OK . Your son is experiencing a dissociative disorder . That 's common for newly awakened coma patients . He feels disconnected from his personality . We knew he 'd need to adjust but he doesn 't know who he is . This is frustrating but you did the right thing bringing him back here . Yeah . - So what now ? - We need to do another cranial MRI . They 'll be here in an hour to take him downstairs . I know this is difficult , Tom . But Kyle 's come this far . We can 't give up now . I think I 've got the exact change . Hello , cutie . Thanks . - How long have you known that man ? - Tony ? About two years . - He 's nice . - He 's very nice . - Why do you say that ? - He 's going to fall in love today . Tony ? My God . Good for him . - It 's not with me , is it ? - Nope . I didn 't think so . Is there something else , Maia ? - How long am I going to be like this ? - Like what ? I don 't want to know things before they happen . I want to be normal , like I used to be . It 's gonna be OK , sweetie . - Besides , who 's normal anyway ? - You are . Huh ! You want to know a secret ? Normal people like me they just wish they were special , like you . Put the television back on . Kyle , when you came home you spent all that time looking through your books . Then the maps , now the TV . What are you looking for ? Maybe we can help you look , too . Come here . - You should go and get some rest . - I 'm not leaving him . All right . I 'll go and grab some stuff . Be back in a half hour , OK ? What are you doing ? Leave him alone ! Who are you people ? I 'm calling Security . I 'm Agent Lytell . I work with your husband . I don 't care who you work with . Tell Tom I figured it out . I know where I have to be . Don 't worry . He 's gonna be safe . The government 's gonna be supervising his medical care from now on . WHITE LIGHT You snatched that kid from a hospital ? What were you thinking ? He 's the only witness to an abduction . He can 't remember his own name . Then we 'll help him remember . His mother 's upset . It 's understandable . - But DC sent me ... - Tom ! - Where 's my son ? - Whoa ! - Get your hands off me . - I 'll ask you one more time . - Ryland ? You wanna help me ? - It 's a tough call . - Where 's Kyle ? - All right , Tom . - Put the gun away . - Dennis ... Tom , put the gun away . - You should have let me pull the trigger . - I was tempted . But shooting Lytell won 't get Kyle back . It 'd make me feel a hell of a lot better . Why Kyle ? Why didn 't he go after Shawn ? Our doctors went over Shawn dozens of times . - Kyle 's new territory for them . - New territory ? - That 's my son . - I know that . - Can 't you call DC ? - What good would that do ? DC put Lytell here in the first place . - They 're backing his play . - So we do nothing ? - I didn 't say that . We 'll get Kyle back . - When ? For Christ 's sake , I don 't know . I just heard an hour ago . I don 't know where Lytell put him . Not good enough , Dennis . I 'm not sitting around while you play phone tag . - I 'm getting my son . Get your hands off . - Tom ! We go back a long way . If you try to go around me on this , none of it matters . I know . Tom , what happened between you and Lytell ? Ask Ryland . Tom ! - Tom ! - What ? - If you 're in trouble , I need to know . - Why ? - Cos I might be able to help . - Just stay out of it , all right ? Drive the car . Blood work looks fine , the RH factor levels are normal and your calcium 's OK . So how do you feel , Lily ? - It 's hard sometimes . - That 's to be expected . Now , where was I ? Oh , right . I 'll have to draw some more amniotic fluid . Why ? Is something wrong ? What kind of genetic anomaly ? All I know is she wants to grow one of the baby 's chromosomes in a lab . It 'll be OK . It 's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes . Either of you play golf ? - I 'm afraid not . - That 's too bad . Listen , about that doctor you sent us to . Roxanne Kern . She 's the best OBG YN in the Pacific northwest . You 're in good hands . So how did that support group meeting go ? - It went well , thank you . - Nobody complain about the catering ? I have to admit , the lobster sushi was a great idea . You see ? You just have to trust me . Your girlfriend has quite an imagination . She thought I was trying to steal her away from you . - Can you believe that ? - Er ... not really . I like your confidence . See ? You were worried about nothing . I wasn 't worried . - We 've gotta tell him . - I 'll do it . It should be me . When ? Soon . I can 't take all this sneaking around . - Besides , I miss seeing you . - I miss you , too . You suspected that Shawn had these abilities since his coming home party and you never told me . - I never told Linda . - You 're divorcing her . - I 'm your partner . - I know . When we were assigned to the 4400 , you were calling them viruses . Have you noticed any change in me ? Maybe because I have one of them living in my apartment . - Point taken . - I would have told you . I heard you , all right ? - Can we continue the reprimand later ? - Fine . - What are we going to do about Kyle ? - " We " ? Of course " we " . We are gonna go find him and bring him home . Then we better get to work . Mr Collier is not available right now . I 'll have him return your call . Thank you , Dr Kern . Dr Kern , the OBG YN ? - Mm-hm . - Jordan about to have a baby ? - I wouldn 't know . - Huh . Here 's the security logs he asked to see . I 'll put them on his desk . Can I see Jordan 's phone logs for the last couple of weeks ? What for ? He 's been receiving some threatening mail . I want to crosscheck it with his incoming calls . It doesn 't leave this office . I need to see Dr Kern right now . Mr Tyler , she can 't be disturbed . - Mr Tyler ! - This won 't take long . Dr Kern . - She 's busy . - Does Lily have an appointment ? No . Why do you call Jordan Collier every time she comes to see you ? - My phone habits don 't concern you . - I think they do . What does Collier know about Lily 's baby that she doesn 't ? Sickle cell anaemia ? How can my baby have the trait for sickle cell anaemia ? Unless the father 's black . Maybe he is . - What are you saying , Richard ? - I don 't know . Maybe whoever took us used me as some kind of donor . The question is , why would Jordan have Dr Kern keep this from us ? The baby 's carrying the sickle cell trait . That brings us closer . Maybe he doesn 't want that to happen . Maybe . I think it 's time me and him had a talk . Michelle Hickock , returnee number 938 . She 's coming in at 4 : 00 for counselling and I want to see her afterwards , OK ? He 's logged on . Lytell 's on the network . You good to go ? Tom really appreciates you helping him . I 'm not doing it for Tom . Come on . Kyle 's being held at the quarantine Centre , building 9 , sub-basement 3 . That 's great . I owe you . OK . Well ... - Marco , thanks for your help . - No worries . - You ready to roll ? - We should wait for the nightshift . - They 're half staff . - OK . I 'll pick you up at 4 : 00 . See you . This is the place . It 's just outside of the city in West Belleview . The seller won 't be there ? He 's in Spain . Another realtor told me . - It 'll be a perfect safe house . - Set it up . - Make sure you 're not followed . - I 'm being watched ? If I was Lytell , I 'd keep an eye on you . Check your mirrors and stay cool . I never thought I 'd have to use what you taught me . You 'll do fine . - I 'll get Kyle and I 'll meet you up there . - I 'll be waiting . - You be careful . - I will . They 're nice , huh ? I remember how much you told me you liked moonstones . I do . But I can 't accept these . Why not ? I mean , I got them for you . Come on , Nikki . Look , I know I messed up . - Didn 't Shawn talk to you ? - What does he have to do with it ? Nikki ? - Hey . - Maia ready ? Maia 's talking with one of your colleagues . Some of the clothes look funny . And the cars . But I don 't know . Video games are kind of fun . Did you like the video games at quarantine ? I hardly ever got a chance to play . Lytell , what are you doing here ? Just talking with Maia . I thought it was time we met . - Stay away from her . - That 's not really your call , is it ? Maia , it was nice talking with you . We 'll do it again soon . I don 't like him . And he doesn 't really like me either . Well , don 't you worry about him . - Are you sure ? - Oh ! You listen to me , Maia . I am absolutely sure . I am not gonna let anything bad happen to you . Hear me ? - All right ? - OK . Jordan , do you have a minute ? I know why you 're here . Roxanne Kern called me as soon as you left her office . I hope you and Lily aren 't blowing this up into something bigger than it is , cos a doctor 's trying to get on my good side . We appreciate everything you 've done , from the house to my job . Our lives have been a lot more comfortable since we met . - You 're gonna hurt me now , aren 't you ? - It 's time you back off . Let us run our own lives . Whatever you want . Tell Lily I said hi , will you ? I 'll do that . - You good to go ? - Just give me a sec . Gloria , don 't answer the door to anyone you don 't know , OK ? Cool . - Are you leaving now ? - Yeah . I 'll be back before you wake up . OK . Better go . Bye . - Diana . - Don 't worry . - You 'll find him . - Find who ? Your son , Kyle . He 's the answer . - The answer to what ? - Everything . I want to see Kyle Baldwin , please . - You 're not on the list . - I 'm a friend of the family . I want to know that he 's all right . He 's not even one of the 4400 and his father works with me and if you could just give me something I could tell him cos ... Come on , we 're both supposed to be on the same side , right ? - I 'll see what I can find out . - Thank you so much . That 's great . You won 't even have a headache when you wake up . Well , maybe a little headache . Come on in . Kyle . Hey , buddy . It 's me , buddy . - Highland Beach . - What about it ? - That 's where I have to go . - Highland Beach . Let 's get you out of here first . Come on . Up . We got him . He 's sitting right here next to me . He 's about the same . No worse , anyway . See you in a little while . - How far away is this safe house ? - It 's about 30 miles . Your mom 's waiting for you , buddy . No . Highland Beach . - Hey ! - Kyle ! Let go ! - Kyle ! - Highland Beach ! - Let go ! Let go ! - Calm down ! - We have to go there now . - What 's at Highland Beach ? - That 's where Shawn disappeared . - I have to go back there . Just calm down , buddy . Just ... - If that 's what you want , we 'll take you . - Are you sure about that ? Kyle 's the answer , right ? Two agents are operating outside us . I noticed . It 's because you pulled the Baldwin kid out of the hospital . - DC wouldn 't see it that way . - DC decided to send you here . Are we gonna bring him in or not ? Find him . These people are coming to the next meeting . It 's bigger than the last so we may need a couple more tables . - I 'll take care of it . - Thank you . Lily . Can I see you for a minute ? - I have a few errands to run . - This won 't take long . Where did you get this ? I 've been doing security checks on everyone who 's moved into the complex . Don 't look shocked , Lily . A lot of people would love to see me fall on my face here . A scandal like this would allow them to force me out of the company . - Richard wouldn 't do this . - I 'd have thought so , too . I guess we were both wrong . Do you really think this is going to change the way I feel about him ? That 's up to you . But Lily ... you really have to ask yourself ... Is this the man you want raising your baby ? Aren 't you gonna say something ? It was my 23rd birthday . A bunch of guys from the barracks invited me out to a bar . - You don 't drink . - Didn 't then either . But it was a big deal them asking me to come along . In those days , Negroes and whites didn 't do much socialising . So I went . It was kind of nice , you know ? Then this woman started coming onto me . People started staring . So I figured it was time for me to get out of there . She followed me outside and asked me to go home with her . I declined respectfully . That 's when she started screaming . - That 's all that happened ? - That 's all it took in 1945 . But the statement the woman made to the police . I mean ... - It 's so detailed . - But Lily , none of it 's true . If I hadn 't been exonerated of those charges , would the air force have sent me to flight school ? Made me a pilot ? The woman lied . The charges got dropped . - Why would Jordan bring this up ? - He wants you doubt me . Doubt us . Do you ? We 've gotta pack whatever we can in five minutes . We 're getting out of here . They 're heading west on Sandburg . There are no freeways in that direction . Highland Beach . That 's where they 're going . Have my car brought around . I don 't care what you do , just keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way . Come on , Mom . Are you serious ? The movies ? Like , you and me ? Is that so weird ? We used to go to the movies all the time . When I was six . Shawn ! You prick ! - Danny ! - Danny ! - Listen to me ... - You goddamn freak ! Danny , stop this ! Boys , please ! Danny , Shawn , stop ! Stop blaming me for Nikki ! Don 't you see it 's over between you two ? That 's enough ! Shawn , stop it ! You 're killing him ! - What did you do ? - I didn 't mean to do anything ! - Danny ! - Get away from him ! Shawn ? - I heard you guys shouting . - Don 't touch me . What ? Don 't touch me . You 're the only good thing that 's happened to me since I 've been back . But I can 't stay here and you can 't come where I 'm going . Shawn ... I love you , Nikki . - I love you . - What are you doing ? Shawn ! No ! Stay here and talk about this . Shawn ! Shawn , what are you doing ? Shawn ! - What 's all this ? - What 's it look like ? Have you thought about what you 're doing ? - It is dangerous outside those gates . - We 'll risk it . - Lily , think about the baby . - What has the baby to do with this ? That baby could be the key to the future and I can protect it better than Richard or anyone . - Lily , get in the car . - I can 't let you do that . Stay away from her . Argh ! Go ahead ! Run ! It won 't do you any good . I will find you . That baby belongs with me . Kyle ! Kyle , we 've been walking for ten minutes . What are you looking for ? Maybe we can help you , Kyle . This is where we found him . We 're running out of time . Kyle , I brought you here like you asked . But if there 's something you need to do , you better do it fast . I belong here . I tried really hard and ... no matter what I 've done , which way I 've turned , it just ... It sucks . I need to clear my head and get away for a while . I guess what I 'm asking is if I could stay here for a while . Shawn , you 're one of the 4400 . As far as I 'm concerned , you can stay here as long as you want . That 's great , man . Thanks . Thank you . So , erm ... tell me a little bit more about this ability of yours . - Any idea where we 're headed ? - I 'll know it when I see it . He 's gonna come after us . The baby likes that . You know ... It really wouldn 't be so bad , would it ? If you were the father ? No , it wouldn 't be bad at all . That 's their car . Let 's go . Listen , these are not criminals . They 're two of our own . Keep your gun holstered . There 's no cause for anybody to get hurt . Kyle , they 're coming for you . They want to take you away . They 're too late . - Kyle ! - No ! Tom , don 't ! Kyle ? Tom . - You 're not my son , are you ? - No . Kyle was meant to be a channel , a way to communicate . - Communicate with who ? - With you . To guide you in your dealings with the returnees . But something went wrong . Shawn interrupted the process . That 's what put him in a coma . He was like that for three years . Tom ! Tom . Tom . Who are you ? What are you ? I 'm human . - Like you . - No . You 're nothing like me . I come from a different time . That is all . Your future . Is that where you took them ? My nephew and all the others ? - We needed them . - For what ? To survive . Skouris . Skouris ! In my time , humanity is dying out . You mean it 's all going to end ? Everything ? - What is going on ? - Kyle brought us out here . - Like he knew it was going to happen . - Maybe he 's not Kyle Baldwin . He said he wasn 't . Maybe he 's telling the truth . Tom ? Tom , are you all right ? We 've got to do something . He could take Baldwin with him . Or kill him . Nobody 's doing anything until we know what 's going on . Only those we took could prevent the catastrophe from happening . That 's why they 've been altered and seeded back into the timeline . Why here ? Why now ? Because history tells us this is where the path to oblivion began . And the people you took are gonna stop that from happening ? How ? They 've begun their work . And you have begun yours . - Tom , come on . - Do something or I will . I need you out of there . I don 't understand . What are we supposed to do ? - You have to help them . - How ? Go ! How ? You 're bleeding . Oh , God . Get an ambulance . Now ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Stay with me , Kyle ! Stay with me ! Stay with me ! Look at me ! Look at me ! Stay ! Stay ! No ! No ! Kyle ! Kyle ! Look at me ! Look at me ! Stay with me , Kyle ! Stay with me ! Stay with me ! Come on ! Come on ! - No ! - Tom ... - Dad ? - Kyle ! What are you doing here ? - Where 's Shawn ? - Kyle ? - I can explain about the beer . - No ! Forget the beer . You don 't have to explain anything . What 's going on ? Tom . Tom . What did you see ? I got you , Kyle . The baby . It 's time ? I 'll get the car .

It 's the metropolis of the future , the pinnacle of progress ... Yes boss . You said it , boss . ... the temple of technology ... Just look at MY city , ScamboviIIe . Instead of trees and grass , there 's steel and glass ... Concrete , asphalt ! And thanks to ME and my tireless efforts ... Yay , hurray for mayor ScamboIi ! ... we have soaring towers , gleaming industries , mega brained robots I couId talk to you about Scambo-weIfare for retired robots ... about Scambonuses for outstanding robot achievements ... - About ... - You about robo-nursing for depressed executives ...

I 'm overworked , I mean o-overturned ... I-I mean overweight ... no , over ... Hello , Pinocchio Welcome home . What is this ? I 'II explain it to you someday . Now we 'II have all the time ... in the world . Oh Pinocchio , we 'II do so many fun things together , like playing . I 'm going to create the most wondrous toys for you . - will we play ball ? - Sure . And all sorts of games . I 'II make up bedtime stories for you . - Funny ones , scary ones ... - With bug-eyed monsters ? ! If you Iike ... And we 'II explore the world together . - The jungle , the mountains ... - And then you 'II grow up , and ... you 'II get married , and Spencer will be your wedding photographer . Grow up ? Spencer , you know he can never grow up . Oh , I ... - Why ? - Son ... You see , I 'm afraid you 'II never ask me to button up your coat ... because it 's cold outside . But ... I don 't have a coat . I think what Doc is trying to tell you , Pinocchio ... is ... is that you 'II never be ... cool . Firecrackers ! I feel good . Who died ? Is this a funeral ? Mom ! Easy , robo-boy . I ain 't nobody 's Mama . I 'm just the local ... fairy . Turn around , boy . Let me have a look at ya . Very design , Geppetto . But then again , you 're italian .

And I know this because I 'm a fairy , and we are clairvoyant His biggest wish for you is to be a real boy . You know I can make his dream come true . What do you say ? - Sure ! - Good . But , first you have ... to Iearn the difference between right and wrong . No sweat . Load the program ! I 'm a super-quick learner . slow down that hard drive , honey . It 's not that easy . Learning right from wrong is something you have to FEEL for yourself . Now , I can give you a couple of hints , reminders really . You 'II get it eventually , honey . Your Dad has given you a sharp mind and a warm heart . Now you just put them together and I 'm sure it 'II come to you . - You can do it , son . - And once you have ... I 'II turn you into a real kid . - deal , cyber-boy ? - Saved to memory ! - Where 'd she go ? - Out there and in here . Don 't worry . It 's not as hard as you think to Iearn right from wrong . Granny PenguindoIyn used to say , " There are 9 ways to skin a cat " ... Spencer ! ... Of course , being a penguin , she could never skin a cat ... SPENCER ! She couldn 't even hit a nail on the head . - Zip it ! - Sorry . Chair . Tomorrow , you 'II go to school . But now , it 's time to close your eyes and sleep . sleep ? ! close my eyes and sleep .

You 're going to be late . Bye Dad . - My son ... in school ... - You should be proud , Mr. Geppetto . ScamboviIIe is so big and beautiful , Spencer . AII the skyscrapers and , and flying machines ... - There 's so much to look at . - Watch out , Pinocchio ! And all the activity everywhere ... I just love it here . Listen to all those noises . It 's so alive . It gives me a feeling of being safe and secure . Is everything OK , Spencer ? Pinocchio ... You have to wait for the flashing light to come on before you can cross . Wait for the flashing light to come on , before I cross . Saved to memory . Does that mean it 's " wrong " to cross at a flashing light ? Yesiree . Very wrong ! - Then why are they stopped ? - well , b-b-b-because it 's different for them . So , sometimes a flashing light means stop , sometimes it means go ? Not exactly . I-I mean , I mean , yes , yes , well sort of , sort ... It-It depends . It depends . Spencer , I think I have a memory conflict . As my Great-Aunt Arctica used to say : " There are no right conflicts . Just wrong solutions . " Saved to memory ...

Scamboland is in full operation now and open for all ... of Scamboville 's children . Now that 's wrong . Everything that man says is wrong . You can 't trust him .

' - Wrong turn ? - Hey Spencey , - who 's the kiddie robot ? - A toy ? ! Can I play with him ? Quiet , wing nut ! - They 're funny ! - Remember , Doc Geppetto ... - wants you to go to school . - Mr . Geppetto ? ! - Geppetto builds great robots . - Let 's see how tough he is . Over here ! Ok , cyber-duck . You are toast ! As uncle Penguini says : " If you can 't join them , beat it ! Hasta Ia pasta , baby ! " CABBY ! Wind me back uuuuuup . - I 'II pick you up here at 5 . - Saved to memory . - Mr . Geppetto really made you ? - He 's my Dad . My name 's Pinocchio . Look , he invented this for me . It 's called a funbreIIa . It makes any day sunny . It even makes bad moods go away . Hi Cynthia ! Hi Zach ! Love your umbrella . - What 's a robot doing at school ? - I 'm a kid just like everybody else . What a funny trick ! Sorry . I 'm just a clumsy robot . H-He 's funny .

Just open your wings and instead of fIappin ' ... you imagine . - Imagine ? - Yes ! What 's the difference Between a robot and a man ? What 's the difference ? What 's the difference Between a program And a heart ? What 's the difference Between me and you ? I got my own emotions I 'm dancing like a puppet I 'm so fast with connections Speeding like a rocket My world is only fiction There 's one thing I can 't do With my imagination I 'm gonna make it true What 's the difference Between the machine and a smile What 's the difference ?

Who wants to be a boy , anyway ! And I won no matter what you say . Imagination game ... - Way to go , Pinocchio ! - Can I have your autograph ? well , to be totally honest , MarIene won .

I 'm not supposed to listen or talk to him . Spencer says he 's bad . And always wrong - Do you want the boss to hear ya ? ! - But I- - - That 's ridiculous . The boss is good and always right .

I Iove to lie here and gaze up at the peaceful stars . And pretty soon , my problems don 't seem so bad .

Let the music play Let me do it my way lt 's my intuition Let the music play Let me go my way I feel that emotion I 'm gonna have some fun Let the music play Let me do it my way I feel that emotion I 'm gonna have some fun Let the music Let the music Control Let the music Control Your body , your soul Let the music Control Your body , your soul What 's the difference ? What 's the difference Between me. between you ? Between me and you ?

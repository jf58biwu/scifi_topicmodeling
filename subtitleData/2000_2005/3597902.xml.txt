 So what do you think ? What do I think about what ? That 's the Brady Bunch house . That 's the house where they shot The Brady Bunch . Are you on crack ? Does that honestly look like the Brady Bunch house to you ? From inside it does . Straight up . I was there delivering a pizza last night , and the guy who lives there is trying to crowd the door so I can 't see inside . But then he drops his Crazy Bread and bends down , and boom , I see it all - the Brady Bunch house . - l 'll prove it . - Wait . What are you doing ? Blake ? It 's midnight . My honor is at stake . All right , nobody 's home . Let 's go . Come on . It 's not even locked . You 're trippin ' . See ? I told you . This is exactly like on the show . Look at this . That weird horse sculpture . And the vase that Peter broke . Mom always said " Don 't play ball in the house . " Remember that one ? - l don 't understand this . - Who 's on crack now ? Hello ? Remember the episode where Marcia broke her nose ? She got hit with a football . - Screw this. I 'm out of here . - Daley , don 't be a puss . Daley . Hello ? Bobby ? Cindy ? Wait . Wait . Come on . Come on . Oh , God . Oh , my God . I 'm tellin ' you . No. I don 't see how . How else do you explain it ? The guy falls from a plane or , I dunno , maybe a helicopter . Out the door , and then ... Simple as that . And how did he wind up in a helicopter ? He was busy breaking into a house at the time . Details . What you got ? Maybe nothing . - You the people from the fbi ? - Michael Daley ? is someone finally gonna arrest that freak ? How about you tell us what you witnessed , and we 'll go from there ? What I witnessed was freaksville . My friend was murdered . Who 'd have thought this could happen at the Brady Bunch house ? - That 's not the Brady Bunch house . - lt is . I know it doesn 't look like it , but it is . That 's where they shot the show . No , they shot the show on a sound stage in Hollywood . The house in the exteriors is a split-level in Studio City. I took a picture of it once . I 'm telling you , it 's like some kind of creepy Brady Bunch museum in there . I told the cops to search it , but they wouldn 't . But whatever the hell happened to Blake , it happened right in there . Oliver Martin ? Mr Martin , I 'm Agent Reyes . This is Agent Doggett . We 're with the fbi . - This is about the death across the street ? - Yes . May we come in ? - l already talked to the police about this . - Yes , sir . We know . As I told them , I didn 't see or hear anything . I wasn 't home . - This guy 's stonewalling . Kick the door in . - Shut up . I 'm really kinda busy . Mr Martin , just five minutes and we 'll be out of your hair . Unless you want us to get a warrant , and then we could be here for hours . Right in here , see ? What happened ? This isn 't what I saw . None of it . It 's all different . Where 'd it all go ? I 'm not following . What happened to all the Brady Bunch stuff ? Mr Daley was under the impression that your house was used for filming The Brady Bunch . Well , it wasn 't . I know what I saw . What are you lookin ' at ? I wanna check somethin ' out . Aha . Hold this , please . Aha . Twice with the " ahas . " Roof 's been patched . When I was inside I knew I smelled fresh plaster . So are you gonna fill me in ? A : our eyewitness places the deceased inside this house just prior to his demise . B : we found a fragment of roofing shingle at the scene of the impact . It would seem it matches the discarded piece you now hold in your hand . C : there 's a hole in the roof , recently patched , this big around . Connect A to B to C. Much in the fashion of , say , Daffy Duck or Wile E Coyote , the deceased shot up through the roof , flew high in the air and landed on his buddy 's car . - You 're serious ? - A to B to C. I think I 'm finally getting the hang of this job . Case number 14-308 . Blake McCormick , a well-nourished Caucasian male , 24 years old . I will begin with my external examination . And here is a likely place to start . Agh ! Help me out here , Agent Scully . Monica thinks I 'm losing my marbles . What can you tell us about what happened ? For starters , Mr McCormick was dead before he landed on the car . His skull was pulverized from a previous impact . And judging by the roofing material that I found in the wound , I 'd say that Agent Doggett 's theory holds water . Like I asked Agent Doggett , how exactly can that be ? - Electricity . - How 's that ? Or maybe electricity is only a by-product , I 'm not really sure , but ... I had an odd experience today , and it made me think to try something unusual . I borrowed an EEG machine and I wired Mr McCormick to it . And for the last few hours he 's been putting off a faint reading . - Are you saying he 's alive ? - No . He 's dead as a hammer . What I 'm reading is residual electricity , like a battery that 's draining off its charge . It 's fascinating . I 've never seen anything quite like it . But what does it mean ? If Mulder were here , I 'd imagine he 'd talk about research linking electromagnetic fluctuations to levitation , poltergeist activity , ghost sightings . Ghosts and poltergeists ? That 's what Mulder would say ? At the end of the day , I wouldn 't have any theory that was any better . And I don 't now . Here 's to you , buddy . Well , folks , I made pork chops and apple sauce . What is this ? What in holy freakin ' hell is this ? Please , leave . They were here. I saw ' em. I saw ' em all . Leave , before it 's too late . I saw the Brady Bunch . Oh , my God . What are you doing ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Aaargh ! Over here , guys . Get the body in the background . Smile . All of Southern California 's watching us scratch our heads in confusion . Let 's go get some damn answers . I 've said all I 'm gonna say to you people . You don 't like it , go get your warrant . He called your bluff . - Maybe we can get a warrant . - Yeah . " Judge , I wanna toss the house of a man who makes people magically zoom into the sky . " " lt has something to do with electricity and poltergeists and whatnot . " Yeah , that 'll fly . - Doggett . - So the owner won 't talk ? - Excuse me ? - Smile . You 're on TV . I 'm in Los Angeles , at the field office . I 've called in someone whom you 'll both wanna meet . April 4 , 1970 . 10 : 36am . Present for this test are John Reits , speaking , and Anthony Fogelman , age 8 . Hello , Anthony . Are you ready to begin ? Good . Now , relax . Relax and focus . Almost immediately , the EEG is registering an increase in beta-wave activity on all leads . Theta activity is rising as well . Oh , my goodness . Oh , my goodness . Well , there you have it . My right hand to God , all four blocks rose off of the table and spiraled halfway to the ceiling before they fell . Too bad that wasn 't on film . The understatement of a lifetime . Whatever phenomenon caused this , I also believe that it radiated an electromagnetic field strong enough to fog the image . Don 't be polite . Call me crazy . Everybody does . I believe you . Did you recognize that kid ? That was our suspect , Oliver Martin . Right ? I went through Mulder 's reference books . Van Nuys , California , 1970 . One of the best-documented cases of what was thought to be poltergeist activity . It focused on a young boy , Anthony Fogelman , who has since changed his name . And Dr Reits was the parapsychologist who investigated it . Objects flew around the house . Rooms would grow inexplicably cold . Strange voices would be heard . Anthony 's mother was at the end of her rope . I spent six months with her and her son . - Six astonishing months . - What did you learn ? That Anthony was as bewildered as everyone else , but that he was responsible for all of it . - He was psychokinetic . - He was the Mozart of psychokinesis . In your line of work , why would you fall out of touch with the Mozart of psychokinesis ? Over time , Anthony 's abilities faded . The last few months I was with him , there were no manifestations of it whatsoever . He lost his power . We 're lookin ' at him for two murders . What can you give us that we can take to ajudge ? Was he an angry kid ? Was he violent ? I can 't say what he grew up to be . I haven 't spoken to him in 30 years . But the Anthony I knew was a lonely little boy . - Bye . - Bye . This is a message for Oliver Martin . Oliver , I believe I knew you years ago as Anthony . This is Dr John Reits calling . Remember me ? It 's been far too long , and I 'd love to talk to you . I 'd really like to catch up . Obviously , you 're all grown-up now . It 's funny. I have trouble picturing that . My God , how time flies . But anyway , you can reach me anytime on my cellphone . 714-555-0146 . I look forward to hearing from you . Bye now . - l guess he 's not home . - He 's home . Aha . I was wondering why a man with no criminal record would change his name . And then I thought about the name itself - Oliver Martin. lt sounded familiar , so I ran it . Through what ? NClC ? No . A Brady Bunch website . It popped right up . " Cousin Oliver ? " - Who the hell 's that ? - Carol Brady 's nephew . He lived with the Bradys during the last season of the show . You 're speaking Greek to me here . What 's this case have to do with an old TV show ? You remember what Daley claimed he saw inside that house . He said it was the Brady Bunch house . He seemed certain of it . And now this name - Oliver Martin . Just connecting A to B to C. is this making ' any sense to you ? When you knew Anthony , was he nutty for The Brady Bunch ? No . We 'd watch it together . Say he is . What 's it mean ? Why name himself after Cousin Oliver ? None of the other Bradys liked Oliver , he was a self-described pest . The jinx . Cousin Oliver , the jinx . So maybe I watched an episode or two . So what you 're saying is that his choice speaks to Anthony Fogelman 's character ? How he views himself - unlucky , star-crossed , a danger . So be it . Just tell me how this helps me bust him and I 'm happy . I 'm starting to hope that it doesn 't come to that . What do you mean ? The power this man seemingly possesses is extraordinary. lt needs to be studied . It could expand the scope of human knowledge. lt could change everything . It very well could . I 've been working this unit for nine years now . I 've investigated nearly 200 paranormal cases . We are due for some incontrovertible proof . I want vindication . For Mulder , and for all of us . What in the hell ? What is it ? Agent Doggett ? What ? Wait here . Oliver Martin ? fbi . - Get out of my house . - Oliver . There 's someone here that wants to talk to you . Dr Reits . Do you remember him ? Why won 't you people just leave me alone ? Please , get out . Agh . No . Oh , crap . Oliver ? Dr Reits ? I could use some help up here . Oliver ? You up there ? is it down there ? Whatever the hell . Oliver . Oliver . - Anthony ? - Hey . I 'm up here . Dr Reits , help me out here . Anthony ? Come back here . He 's dangerous . Anthony ? Anthony , let him go . I can 't . Sure you can . No . - l don 't know how . - Anthony , you 're a good person . I know that hasn 't changed . Relax and focus , remember ? Good . Relax and focus . Oh , my God . This is ... - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Just minor bruising . Dana Scully , meet Oliver Martin . Anthony Fogelman . - Oliver . - Oliver . - lt 's a great pleasure to meet you . - Where did all this come from , Oliver ? How did you make this come to be ? I think about it , and it 's here . Can you think about other things ? What happens if you think about another place ? A nice place ? Can you do that , Oliver ? Please ? It 's important to me . Oh , my God . Mainly , I like to be here . Oliver , with your help we could learn so much . I would love to take you back with us to Washington . It would mean so much to me , Oliver , to show the whole world . Wonderful . Let 's go get you packed . - We 've got a tiger by the tail . - Do you believe he intended to kill you ? He wanted me out of his house , and the way I went was involuntary , like a sneeze . It means he 's not in control of this power of his . I think that 's where we can help him . He needs to learn how to control his powers . My God , there 's no end to what he could accomplish . Or to the harm he could do if he goes off the deep end , which isn 't a long walk for this guy , in case you haven 't noticed . This whole Brady Bunch thing ? I 'm not so sure about this . We can 't keep him here . Two people are dead . Clearly this isn 't working . And besides , I mean , as grand as this may sound , we owe it to the world . Maybe , except that I can 't shake this feeling that the other shoe 's gonna drop . That there 's something Oliver 's not telling us . Oliver ? Coming ? Oliver ? Wow . May I have a glass of water ? We 'll only be a minute . Anything you need , just ask Arlene . - So what do you think , Dr Jaycocks ? - What do I think ? I think there 's a hell of a lot of physics books that are due for major rewrites . And I think a year from now you and Dr Reits will be in Stockholm accepting a Nobel prize . This will change everything . - May I use your phone ? - Yeah . So you 're on board with this ? - What happens next ? - l want Kersh to see this . I want the director himself in here . Do you realize what this means ? This kind of proof ? It ensures that they can 't shut you down . It means the X-Files will go on forever . Agent Scully . - He 's having a seizure . What happened ? - l saw a big spark , then he just collapsed . We need an ambulance . We got a man having a seizure . AD Skinner 's office . Make it quick . It was just all the excitement . A little bed rest will do him wonders . And we 'll get things right back on schedule . - What do his doctors say ? - His electrolytes were severely imbalanced . That sent him into shock . They 've stabilized his fluids . - When will they release him ? - There are problems . His thyroid level is elevated . His glucose is low . CPK , liver enzymes and BUN , they 're all elevated . - Which in a nutshell means ... ? - lt points to a multi-system organ failure . Gradually his body is consuming itself . It 's been going on for months , and maybe even years . What 's causing it ? His doctors have no idea , but I think I 'm starting to . This power of his , it 's eating him alive . And if so , it follows that the more he uses it the more his health will decline . Until finally ... What in the hell ? My God . Oliver ? Oliver , those people just now , was that ... ? Were they ... ? Why were they here ? To say goodbye . Why goodbye , Oliver ? Because I 'm dying . April 4 , 1970 . 10 : 36am . Present for this test are John Reits , speaking , and Anthony Fogelman , age 8 . Hello , Anthony . Are you ready to begin ? - Any change in his condition ? - They 're trying everything they can think of . Experimental drugs , plasma transfusion . - None of that 's gonna work . - Why not ? Because they 're treatin ' the symptoms , not the cause . - What do you have , John ? - One big question . Why The Brady Bunch ? Seriously . You two are fans . Why are people still watching a 30-year-old TV show ? Because they 're the family everyone wishes they had . Loving parents , lots of brothers and sisters , everybody getting along . They 're the perfect family , and since Oliver didn 't have one as a child , he created one . Sure , I 'd buy all that . But in this case , why The Brady Bunch ? Why not The Partridge Family ? Why not Eight ls Enough ? Where was Oliver when he first saw The Brady Bunch ? He was with you , right ? He 'd always insist that we watch it together , every week I was there . The longer you two were together , the more his power faded , until finally it went away completely . Why do you think that was ? Because for the first time in his life , he was happy . Because he was with you . What are you suggesting is the course of action , John ? A : Oliver 's gonna die if he continues to use his power . B : his power goes away when he 's happy . And C : you 're the father he never had and he loves you . A to B to C. Come on , Oliver . You gotta eat something . Doctor 's orders . Talk to him , will you ? Oliver ? You have to understand - my life 's work , the vindication of it , it 's so important to me . I let it blind me . I treated you like a lab rat , and not a man . And 30 years ago , I left with barely a goodbye . I am sorry for that . You can 't use your power . Not ever again . I forbid it . I can 't be alone . You won 't be . You 've got me . Can you forgive me , Oliver ? Anthony . So close , Dana . I 'm sorry you don 't get your proof . Me too . Maybe I 've had it these past nine years . If not proof of the paranormal , then of more important things . Here 's hoping the TV stays off and he learns how to love the real world . I think you are getting the hang of this job .

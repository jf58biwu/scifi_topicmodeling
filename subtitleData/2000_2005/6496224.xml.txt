Carl , Brad , Roy ... - You forgot a suspect ... Claudia . Do you want to kill me ? - No . In my opinion , a 72-hour observation period would be most beneficial right now . - I had no choice .

I don 't have a gun , you can search me . Carl Axelrod escaped from the hospital . Professor Neumeyer gave that to me . He wanted me to have it . I don 't care what he wants . - Give me that case !

But why this ? - Why ? So he can make sure that I die the way I 'm supposed to , down to the very last detail . What do you mean there 's no green Jeep Cherokee ? Well , Mr ... - I called , I checked . I have a confirmation number , you guaranteed it . That 's why I came all the way out here . Right , it 's not back yet . It 's supposed to be back ...

No , it 's just the guards , honey . No , they 're gone , the guards are gone . Damn it . Okay , listen to me ... what 's your best hiding spot ? Jesse , think . - Okay . It 's in the back of my dad 's closet . There 's a tiny crawlspace . You 're going to go in there and you 're not going to come out until I tell you to come out , okay ? - Okay . Be very quiet , all right ? Okay , shh . You hurt me . You wanted to hurt me . Little girl ... ? Sikorski , there 's no one out front . - Stay here . Jess ... ? Jess ! Jesse ! Jesse ! Jess ! Jess !

I tried to contact you to give back what I took . What did you take from me ? - The quitclaims . Roy , just let Jesse go . Drop her on a street corner . She 's got nothing to do with this .

No , no ! Don 't ! Don 't ! I 'll do whatever I want . It was there . I put it there yesterday . Shut up ! We 'll just go inside and wait for your boy friend to bring them . Come on , little girl , come on . - Ow ! One big happy family . Why would he go back there ? Because I showed him the file . He knows where I 'm supposed to be . There 's no way you 're going into " Buck Naked . " I 'm going to handle this . I 'm calling a SWAT team from Seattle ... No SWAT team . There was no SWAT team the first time . Jesse didn 't die . Claudia didn 't die . Let 's keep the variables to a minimum . You 're sounding more and more like your buddy Carl . Maybe he 's on to something . Yeah ... you . Okay . Are you scared , my little sweetheart ? Are you scared ? That 's a good thing to be scared , because ... that means you 're gonna listen to me . Listen to me carefully . Look at me . Look at me ... good girl . I want you to be very quiet , okay ? Because otherwise , Daddy is going to get hurt . We don 't want Daddy to be hurt , do we , hmm ? Good little girl . Angela ...

No , come on , give me a gun . I need a gun . What were you thinking ? Hmm ? You don 't steal from Roy Bremmer . I wouldn 't trust this outside of 10 feet . You know ... they 've been laughing at me behind my back ... " the man who couldn 't find his own wife . " Oh , yes . All right , if the shooting starts , I want you to stay as low to the ground as you can . And don 't shoot me . Kiss me . Come on . Let 's call your boy friend , huh ? Look at you . You 're a mess . Dad ... ? Jesse ! Jess ... Put the gun down . - Put the gun down now ! Put the gun down now ! - Shut up , shut up , shut up ! Claudia ! - Shut up , shut up all of you . Claudia , are you okay ? - I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Where 's Jesse ? - She 's safe . She 's safe ... if you give me back what you stole from me . I didn 't " steal " Claudia . - Angela ! You think this is all about Angela ? It 's never just about one thing . JT , there were papers in my car , under the front seat in an accordion file . They belonged to Roy . - What the hell are you talking about ? Play dumb like that and your little girl is going to get hurt . All right . - JT , don 't , don 't ! He won 't hurt Jesse . Yes , I will ! - No , he won 't . Jesse ? - Shut up ! Dad ! - Jesse ! Where is the girl ? We need to know now ! Dad ! - Okay , okay . You give me the quitclaims , I give you Jesse . The what ? - He doesn 't have them , Roy . He doesn 't even know about them . I never told him . Never told me what ? What ? - I don 't want them anymore . All I want is you and Jesse . I tried to give them back ... Dad ! - Jesse , Jesse ! Dad ! Dad ! I 'm coming , Jess , I 'm coming , I 'm coming . Dad ! - I 'm okay , just go . I 'm all right . Go ! Congratulations , Angela . You 've just inherited $ 12 million worth of property . Is this what you 've been holding out for ? I found them in your car last night in that brown accordion file . That 's when I knew it really was my week . Now , with Roy dead ... You 're free to sign them over to me . You 're just a damn ... - I prefer " opportunist " myself . Your weakness is Claudia , mine is $ 12 million . You can 't do this . - Watch me . Angela ... sign the quitclaims , or I shoot your boy friend . No , you won 't . You can 't pull the trigger . I saw you yesterday . You had a clear shot at Roy . You don 't have the balls ... or the bullets ... in case you do have the balls . Like I 'd give you a loaded gun . Claudia , hold on , hold on ! Where is it ? Where is it ? Where is it ? Where is it ? - Is this what you 're looking for ? It must be weird having everything come together just like it 's supposed to , no matter what you do . What about Jesse ? Jesse is what you got out of today . Claudia ? I 'm not going to insult your intelligence . You don 't make it ... neither of you . Roy kills you two , I kill Roy , I 'm a hero . And I want you to know it 's going to haunt me ... but for $ 12 million worth of real estate , I 'm prepared to live with my pain . Don 't sign , Claudia . What 's the point ? The point is , Jesse makes it . Her signing the quitclaims over to me makes sure Jesse has a future . The same future she was going to have . How do I know you 're not going to kill her anyway ? Don 't give me a reason to . I 'm so sorry . Now , where are you supposed to be ? You 've got to do it , JT . Why ? - Maybe Carl was right . Carl wasn 't right . Roy wasn 't here , Claudia wasn 't here ... Jesse wasn 't here . Well , then , maybe everything you did this week only made matters worse . It certainly made me richer . Run , Jesse ! Jesse ! I 've got her . She 's here . Oh , God . JT ! - Dad ! What are you going to do , throw it at me ? That bullet 's 50 years old . You 're still gonna die . Carl ... I 'm sorry , I can 't stop now . Carl , you 've got to stop ... - This has to happen . No , Carl , it doesn 't have to happen . I know , I know , I 'll go to jail . Carl , Carl , listen to me , listen . It 's just damn physics . Physics is the fabric of life . - Yeah . I know . Carl , have a look at that . What 's that ? It says " Sikorski / Bremmer . " Why does it say " Case Closed ? " Where 's the other report ? There is no other report . - Dad ! Come here , sweetie . Come here . Okay , okay . What is that ? Where is the other ... ? You okay ? That 's the cop that arrested me . Is that Bremmer ? Look at that , it 's just like the other report ... Consistent , casual loop ... that 's where I am ... or I 'm in a parallel universe , that 's what it is . Oh , my God , this is just like the original ... It 's perfect . This is ... Professor Neumeyer , you don 't die . I like this version better . ... go back to the beginning and start at the start . It comes around right on folded paper . Oh , it 's beautiful , it 's beautiful . This makes perfect sense . Professor Neumeyer ? Is it over ? Yes . Are you sure ? Yes , I 'm sure . The police and ambulances are on their way . The universe looks pretty good from here , doesn 't it , Carl ? This is yours ! I 'll get it . - Okay . See you . - Bye . Well ... I guess I 'm not the only Professor JT Neumeyer in the family . That is , if you take the next 50 years into account . Jesse sent the case ? Yeah . " Jesse Tracy Neumeyer " What ? What ? Come here .

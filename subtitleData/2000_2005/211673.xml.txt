 NERVE Here you are ! - Are you sure you should be exercising ? - Why not ? Well , a little while ago a commando skewered you with his Swiss army knife . The muscles have completely healed . Do you want something ? Yeah ... Are your Comms on the blink ? We called you three times for dinner . Not hungry . No ? ... Well next time answer . It 's kind of rude not to reply . Leave me alone ! Yeah . Sure . As soon as you tell me what the problem is . Aeryn , what is that ? You 're ice cold . Alright , knock off the completely healed crap and talk to me . We 'll talk to Zhaan . Closest thing we 've got to a doctor . No , don 't summon the others . Just let me get to my Prowler . Your Prowler ? What , you 're going to go for a drive ? Last I heard we weren 't within Prowler ... No , you are not going to die . I didn 't lie to you , my muscles are healed , but that knife must have pierced my paraphoral nerve . and once that is damaged , it doesn 't regenerate . So within 50 or 60 arns , it 's going to fail , and I am going to die . There 's nothing you can do about it . There 's something we can do . The only treatment is a tissue graft from a genetically compatible donor . Fine ... we 'll find someone . We got , two , three days ? No ... At best ... and we 're nowhere near a Sebacean colony . But we are ... near a Peacekeeper base ... Less than 20 arns ... and those commandoes were kind enough to leave the address . You 're not just fahrbot , you 're magra - fahrbot ! - I did it before , I can do it again . - Yeah ! By the skin of your mivonks . Your masquerade as a Peacekeeper fooled four battle weary commandoes briefly . lnfiltrating a top secret Gammak Base is ... quite another matter though , John . When you get inside the base you 're going to have to find a tissue match . and obtain a tissue sample . If he 's found out we 're all put at risk . Will Moya be able to get us out of here with her pregnancy so far advanced ? So what are we saying here ? We do nothing ? We let Aeryn die ? Is everybody happy with that ? No , John , I do not want Aeryn to die . Nor do I. Well , you could have fooled me . What about you , guido ? How do you feel about this ? Look ! What 's the difference what we want ? She is dying . We must face reality here . The only sensible course of action is ... I 'm sorry , Sparky . What were you saying ? Is to do everything in our power to save Aeryn 's life . Right . Even though it 's likely to get us killed . This mission is foolhardy , Crichton . It makes no sense for you to be killed as well . Let 's just cut our losses . Drop the martyr routine , Aeryn . I 'm not going to let you die . Crichton ... We 've reached the designated co - ordinates . Thank you , Pilot . Do humans have some sort of ritual for occasions like these ? Well , there is the handshake ... Followed by good luck . Good luck . How was that ? Perfect . The planet is an uninhabitable gas giant , but it has a large moon on the far side . Large enough to have an atmosphere , Pilot ? Yes ... the base must be located there . In this orbit , the planet 's huge mass will shield us from it completely . Gotta love a man in a uniform . Yeah . I love a girl in grey . - Travelling outfit . - Yeah ? - You going somewhere ? - With you . - Think again . - I 'll think out loud . What you need on this jaunt , is a talented burglar and distraction causer . You 're volunteering ? What 's the angle ? I want to earn my keep aboard this boat . You ? No , I don 't think so . At least take this . Peacekeeper ident chip . Maximum security clearance . This is Larraq 's . How did you get this ? Told you I was talented . Alright , fine . I could use the help . If you 're going to help . We 'll pull the same routine we pulled on those Marauder Commandoes . You 're the boss man and I 'm your meek little server . You sure you don 't want me to fly this thing ? You know how ? Yeah . Do you ? Oh yeah , you should see my Immelman ... Check this out . Looks like some kind of mining complex . Maybe a refinery ? Looks like it 's been nuked . A long time ago , big time . Could be camouflage . Could be dead . Ah , it 's not dead . Eight targeting systems have just locked onto us . Typical warm Peacekeeper welcome . Prowler to Gammak Base . What 's with the weapons locks , you idiots ? Can 't you tell a friend from a foe ? Prowler , identify yourself . On an open channel ? I don 't think so . If you want to count my teeth , do it after I land . The channel is secure . If you don 't identify yourself , we will ... You 'll what ? Shoot me down ? It 's not a good idea to gun down a superior officer without first checking his Ident Chip . Prowler , you have a landing vector . Thank you so much . You 're not completely untalented yourself . Thank you so much . I 'm Tollona Javio , Commander of this base . This is Lieutenant Heskon . And you would be ... ? Larraq . Captain . And don 't even think of asking what my assignment is . I wouldn 't dream of it , Captain , but we do need to see your ident Chip . Ident Chip verified , sir . - Satisfied ? - Delighted to have you with us , Captain . Though I am wondering ... how you knew this base was here . Keep wondering . I 'll need quarters for myself and for my personal server . Your ... ? Larraq ? Make sure the quarters are comfortably cool . It 's hot in here . You brought a civilian with you ? You 're getting nosy . Just admiring your taste . May I offer food and drink to you and your ... server ? I 'd love some refreshment . I could get real fond of this place . The Rasklak is good ... and strong . Is that how you like it ? Strong and hot ... Makes the mouth tingle ... Help it go down ... smooth ... and slow . I 've never seen a species quite like hers . Males outnumber females here ? Five to one ? What do you poor guys do for fun ? Not very much . Well I 'd say I got here ... just in time . What did you pay for her ? You don 't want to know . Does she give good ... value ? She has her moments . Excuse me Captain , duty calls . So , I 'm ... Chiana ! Front ! What the hell are you doing ? You acting like a trollop was not part of the plan . They bought it , didn 't they ? You 're drawing a lot of attention . The more they look at me , the less they look at you . Do you think ... that before they elect you centrefold of the year , we could get on with the business of saving Aeryn ? Your quarters have been assigned . Level 4 , number 6 , ierg 5 . You 're so helpful . I 'll need your ident Chip , sir . Again ? If you would place your hand in here thank you , Captain . You know who we are . Let us past . Sir , everything beyond this point is Security 3 Velka ... genetic verification required . Is this really necessary ? Larraq gets so impatient with delays . Captain , I must ask you to place your hand in the device . And I must ask you , Lieutenant : Who are you to give me orders ? I can give you orders because I 'm a Chief Security Officer , Captain . Not for long , if this is how you treat your superior officers . You will comply , Captain . Analyzing . Genetic scan verified . Satisfied ? He 's only doing his job . Let 's get to our quarters so I can do mine . - Well , I am for that . - I 'll take you there immediately . - Six ierg five , I 'll find it myself . - Yes , Sir . How the hell did we get away with that ? Did you do something to do the chip ? Larraq ! John ? Gilina . What are you doing here ? - Is Crais here ? - No . I 've been assigned to a new development project here . - To do what ? - They haven 't told us . I assume it 's some - thing to do with developing , weaponry of some kind . New weapons ? In Peacekeeper hands ? Yeah , just what this galaxy needs . It 's okay ... She 's a friend . - How 'd you know I was here ? - I saw you in the Officers ' Lounge , wearing that uniform . I knew you 'd never pass the genetic scan , so I overrode the security programme . You did all that ? What , from here ? Yes . Crichton ... this is a very good friend . Not acceptable , Commander . We must increase the efficiency of the Aurora Chair . - I 'll need more Techs , sir . Understaffed . - Understaffed , or mismanaged ? We 've also got to find a match for this tissue sample of Aeryn 's , or she 'll die . You 'll help us ? Of course . - Stay here , I 'll take the sample to the Medical Unit . - No , no , no , - I 'm not going to put you at risk . - I won 't be , I can fake the work orders and the Med Techs won 't ask any questions . We 're used to secrecy . It 's still too dangerous , I 'll go . John , you should stay hidden . Suppose somebody here knew the real Larraq ? Well , she 's right . One close call 's enough . - Yo , Pip . - I 'm going to go back to the lounge ... let our good friend Mr. Chief Security Officer buy me another Rasklak . Come home alone . I ... I came to see how you were doing . You came to see if I was dead so you could start going through my possessions . I resent your unfounded accusation . Furthermore , you have no possessions worth taking . - How inconsiderate . - Yes ! How terribly inconsiderate . - Rygel , you are needed on Command . - I am ? What for ? A quick decision may be required if the Peacekeepers arrive . A quick and correct decision . I accept this vital responsibility . Thank you . If a warrior cannot die in battle , she can at least die alone . Talk about something to remember him by . Duty cycle complete , Lieutenant ? I was ... leaving . I thought I 'd get at least another round out of him . Raslak ? We can do much better than that . Zhaan ? Aeryn is deteriorating fast . This is no way for someone to die , even a Peacekeeper . D 'Argo , all I can do is ease her journey . The nerve that was damaged regulates toxin removal functions . The poisons that are building up in her body ... they 're killing her . Well can you filter them out ? I have no means to do that . Zhaan ... Moya does , doesn 't she ? Not a bad way to live . Not at all . Would you like to stay ? Whatever you 're getting from Larraq , I can easily double . I 'm getting quite a bit . 'Course , I 'm worth it . I think you 're selling yourself short . Covert Op types are always flying off to some backwater planet and getting shot up . This is much more civilised . I am getting real tired of ... running from system to system with a guy , who 's got a talent for getting into danger . Exactly ... With me , you 'd be comfortable and pro - tected . Shall we continue this discussion in my quarters ? My policy is no free samples . Let me ... let me consider your offer on my own . Good news . - They found a match ? - Even better . We don 't need to find a donor . Our medics can now synthesise , paraphoral tissue . Right , how long will it take ' em to cook up a batch ? They already have . One dose , some bed rest , and she 'll be as healthy as ever . Thanks doesn 't even begin to cover it . You don 't have to thank me . I 'd better get back to the ship . If I 'm late ... Aeryn dies . I wouldn 't even dream of stopping you . We always seem to be saying goodbye . Yeah . You think we 'd get better at it . Go ! That man ... He is an imposter ... Seize him . Get him up ! My name is Larraq , Peacekeeper Special Ops . Unfortunately , wrong , on all counts . I am Scorpius . But of course you are ... Peacekeeper ? Funny , you don 't look like a Sebacean . On the other hand , you do look Sebacean , yet your energy signature , is quite dissimilar . What species are you ? And who are you working for ? Get ... Stuffed . You attempt to provoke me Perhaps you 're hoping I will lose my composure , and kill you , before I have extracted any information . I long ago learned the advantages of patience . What the hell was that ? Pain memory ... Random and indistinct at the moment . It will take some time to map your neural patterns . You stay the hell out of my mind , you ! That was a Leviathan ship , was it not ? I seem to remember ... a report of an escaped Leviathan prison transport . Have Javio checked the data files . You are a most interesting spy . This may help stabilise you until Crichton returns with a cure . Are you sure this won 't hurt Moya ? Pilot says no . The toxins your body generates are insignificant to Moya , - relative to your sizes . - What about her baby ? The baby 's already well over a sakmar . This will not affect it . Whether it works or not , Zhaan , I commend you on your ingenuity . Actually , it wasn 't my idea , it was ... it was Pilot 's . Crichton 's been captured . Can you find out where they 're keeping him ? I can 't access main control . They have shut down the main grid they suspect someone is helping him . Sooner or later they 're going to find out who . Waste ... of ... time . I 'm not a spy . According to the report , the Leviathan had a Delvian , Hynerian and a Luxan aboard . No mention of a creature like him or his female accomplice . Whom you have yet to locate . You charged my brother 's Prowler in that white death pod on yours . You 're talking about that near miss I had the first minute I got here ? That was an accident . That was no near miss for my brother . That was Captain Bialar Crais . The Leviathan escaped from his convoy . As I recall , he received special dispensation from the Council , to head into the Uncharted Territories , and hunt it down . Right , but First Command lost contact with his carrier some time ago . I want to see more of that . I can 't locate it again , sir , but I 've found something , linked to it . Tauvo is dead . Struck down by a weak ... pathetic , inferior being . You will die at my hands . I suspect our Captain , has turned renegade . Broadcast a wide dispersal message , coded to Crais 's Command Carrier . Direct him , to come immediately . - You think he 'll actually show up ? - Certainly . Tell him we have his prey . What do you think ? Will it work ? I don 't even think John would recognise you . Let 's track him down and find out . Oh , God ! Your memory holds an impressive array of other races , Crichton . You 're quite a well travelled spy . For the ninth time , Nosferatu , I 'm not a spy ! His previous missions are unimportant . I want to know who sent him here , and why . Keep searching . It 's deja vu all over again . There are but a few planets where we can live . The Ancients have stories of a world that will welcome us . We can only hope they 're true . Malfunction ? No , he 's put up a neural block . Wasn 't me . Damn don 't you hate it when the batteries go dead . Break through it . Increase the extraction level . These equations are necessary for creating a wormhole . I don 't remember that . You 're teaching me how to ... No , you cannot acces this data consciously . You won 't remember this part of our encounter . We will not give you , wormhole technology . Why not ? If you 're not smart enough to discover it on your own , you 're not smart enough to handle it wisely . You 'll have to find it yourself . The unconscious knowledge we have given you , will guide you . Nothing more . That 's all that we can do for you . But that should be enough , you are already on the right path . Well , well , well . Our spy has an interest in wormhole technology . He ... he gave me the equations . And that 's why you came to this place . What 's this base got to do with ... That 's why you built it ? All this research ... You 're trying to create a wormhole ! As are you . That creature knows how . but he wouldn 't tell you , would he ? Or so you thought . So ... You sought that knowledge here ... never realising ... that you already had it , locked deeply away . Find it ! Segment his mind as many layers as it takes . No please ... Or his mind will simply liquefy . He seems to be an exceptionally strong species . Short recuperation ... then we 'll start again . Hey ! Don 't put that thing in here ! I don 't want a room mate ! Get him out ! Hey , that 's my mat . Get off my mat ! Go on ! Go ! Fine ... I don 't want any trouble . This is my side ! That 's your side ! You stay on your side ! My side , your side ! My side , your side ! You were just in my Chair too , weren 't you ? You talking about Scorpius 's chair ? Scorpy ... Scorpy puts me in the Chair ... over , and over , and over , and over . The chair did this to you ? That 's me , that 's me , that 's me ... Danger ... Danger , Will Robinson . Beware the chair . Beware the chair . The treatment 's working , but all it seems to be doing is stopping her from deteriorating further . Why didn 't you want me to tell her it was your idea ? Earlier on , Aeryn told me she wanted to die alone . As a warrior , I should respect her wishes and not interfere . You did a good thing , you may have saved her life . Despite her words , she really didn 't want to die . I don 't even believe that she wants to die alone . Pilot ! Pilot , are we under attack ? No , it 's Moya , she 's having muscular contractions . - Is she giving birth ? - I 'm not sure . It 's killing Aeryn we 've got to stop the treatment now . Hold her down ! Right , Pilot ! Isolate Aeryn now ! Let 's hope Crichton gets here soon . This should bypass the grid and hook us directly ... with main control . Spare me the technobabble , Gadget Girl . Let 's just get on with it . That 's it , Scorpy ! Thrill me again ! Excuse me , sir , Captain Crais has arrived . Where is he ? Where is Crichton ? This way , Captain . I have orders to recapture the Leviathan and its passengers . Captain ... Crichton has vital information . Until I get it , you may not ... I order you to release him to me ! Your adherence to orders is ... selective . You have repeatedly failed to cease the pursuit and return to First Command . I have received no such orders . Your dereliction of duty is not my prime concern . Give me your full co - operation ... and you can have Crichton ... when I have finished with him . Give me Crichton now and I 'll get you all the information he possesses . Torture alone would be ineffective . Only the Aurora Chair can extract the information we need . But the Chair might well kill him before you find it . There in lies the stalemate I must break . You know this human ... better than anyone . What would persuade him to stop resisting the Chair ? I 've found him . He 's in a cell on Level 9 . I may be able to patch into it . Let 's see . John ! John ! It 's Gilina . Keep your back to the wall camera and it 's safe to talk . I 've bypassed the audio to the monitoring station . How 're you doing ? You okay ? ... Are they on to you ? No , Chiana and I are in hiding . Chiana , are you there ? Listen , I stashed the tissue gizmo under the checkpoint . Third intersection past the T. You got that ? - Got it . - Good , go find it and get it back to the ship . - We 've got to get you out of there . - No , no , forget about me . Just get the sample back to Moya , Aeryn can 't have that much time . John ! There 's somebody coming . Crais ! How do I get out of this place ? Once I take , they 'll blast me out of the sky before I make half a metra . I don 't understand it ... Why wouldn 't Crichton try and save himself ? Chiana ? Does Aeryn mean that much to him ? No . Aeryn 's just a ... Just a shipmate . Crichton is in love with you . Why do you think he 's staying ? Look ... once Aeryn 's okay we 'll come back with reinforcements get the both of you . Yeah ? Okay . If he wants me to go with him . Let 's get you out of here . You are dead , Crichton ... but you have one choice . Do you wish to save the lives of your shipmates on Moya ? - What are you talking about ? - Why do you think I 'm here ? I 've recaptured the Leviathan ... The fugitives are back in my custody ... However , whether I deliver them alive or dead ... is up to me . How do I keep them alive ? Stop resisting the Aurora Chair . Allow us ... to probe freely ... for any information we wish . That 's not a very good option . You are not in a very good position . So everybody on the ship 's okay ? Zhaan ? Aeryn ? They 're all unharmed , as is the Leviathan . They 're all in perfect health . That could easily change . Fetch the comfy chair . There , I 've programmed a blind spot into the targeting system . Keep your Prowler on this trajectory and they won 't even see it . Well how will I know if it works ? You won 't get blasted out of the sky . Great ... Now all I have to do is get to the Prowler . Well I 'll give you a diversion . How much head start do you think you 'll need ? Give me 400 microts . Go ! One more , sir , please ! Please , one more ! I got my mind right , boss . - Be nice . - We will . - Where are you going , Tech ? - Sorry , sir ? - Where are you going ? - I ... I ... - Please forgive me . - On your way . - Report ? - Level 6 clear . 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 Evacuation warning ... Reactor overload ... Evacuation warning . Evacuation warning ... Reactor overload ... Evacuation warning ... Evacuation warning ... Evacuation warning ... Evacuation warning ... Evacuation warning ... Reactor overload ... Evacuation warning ... Evacuation warning ... Clear the area ! Get everyone away from the reactor core ! Emergency radiation gear is on Level 10 ! Commander Javio , wait ! Sir , this Prowler is non - operational . There 's a faulty component in the ... In the froonium drive ... causing instabilities , in the ... stabiliser . It may have been fixed ... if I could just have a look . Very good , Chiana . I thought the Commander was to be the last one to evacuate . It 's funny , I believe just the opposite . We could both leave , continue our earlier discussion . It won 't work twice . - What was that ? - The tissue sample . Crichton succeeded . Then I 'm not going to die . As you once said to me ... you will die ... but not today . Are you sure about that ? I 'm starting to hallucinate . You make a worse Peacekeeper than Crichton . Glad to see you 're okay . Where is he ? I want to see him . You will ... soon . She should rest . Great idea . Some of us desperately need to bathe . D 'Argo ? I 'll stay here and watch over her , just in case . Thank you . The reactor warning was a false alarm . Sir . A prowler has launched without authorisation . It has vanished . There are no sensor readings at all . Crichton 's accomplice ... One of them , anyway . The false alarm was a diversion . - Who triggered it ? - We don 't know , sir . We 're still checking . Crichton will tell us .

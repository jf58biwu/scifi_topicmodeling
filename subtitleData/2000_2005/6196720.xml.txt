 Ah , there you are . We 're dividing spoils from the depository . These were set aside for you to choose from , and I understand that ... She is burnt . She 's badly crippled because of our desires . - Let go ! - Was all this wealth worth it ? Of course not , you blue bitch . But what 's done is done ! - Just as long as we 're wealthy ? - May as well put it to good use . Crais and Talyn have located some kind of surgeon , a healer species . We 're almost there . We 're all choosing one or two items we want , the rest is to pay any fee for Moya 's remedy . - I 'm sorry Rygel . I misjudged you . - It 's becoming your career . Now listen , John . Be smart . See the situation for what it is . Screw you ! No John . Not this time . We 've reached the end of the old ... the beginning of the new . I am in control . I am in control of me ! - No more John . - Screw you ! The reverse is more likely . Stop it ! Stop it ! I can 't ! I can 't ! No . There 's no one here , John . You made yourself bleed ! Scorpius ! Scorpius ! Yes . Listen ! He put a neural tracer chip in your brain . - You know this . You know he isn 't really here . - I see him ! I see him ! Well fight it . Listen to me . We 've reached the surgical facility . We 're going to see if they can remove the chip . I have to smash him ! No ! Scorpius isn 't really there , John . I need you to face reality as it is ! It 's ridiculous , I know . She cannot see us , John . - What 's happening to me ? - You know what 's happening to you . Scorpius put that frelling chip in your brain . Aeryn ... what do you see ... in the mirror ? - What do you see ? - There is no mirror . There is no Scorpius . Look ! You must confront your fears , with strength . You 're right , Aeryn . There 's no Scorpius here ... There 's only me ... My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... Radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... Lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship ... A living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... Help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Die Me Dichotomy If it wasn 't serious , they wouldn 't have called us , would they ? Now when you 're done ... the big picture . I don 't like him . He 's rumored to be one of the best healers in the Uncharted Territories . No , not him . His sleazy confederate ... Gonsick . Grunchlk . Splendid hearing . Doc fix there . - Can he save Moya ? - Oh , looks good ! He 's splendid with infections . He 'll make up a mixture . It 'll be absorbed through these scarred areas . And then a couple of applications . Keep the patient sedated . - You 're laughing . - How much ? By my calculations , let 's say ... exchange equivalent , with the meter and all of that ... - 12,000 Kretmas . - Outrageous ! Just a microt ! I don 't know . What do you think ? I don 't know if we have any choice . She 's gotta get fixed , but this is crazy . He always thinks I undercharge . He 's a greedy bastard , it 's a species trait . Now , I 'm sorry to have to do this to you but , he insists ! - That 's 15,000 Kretmas . - I could buy a whole new ship for that . Well , I had to let an aunt die once because we couldn 't afford a fixer . I 'm gonna go and assess our funds . If you don 't make her better , we are gonna get you . - Let me introduce you . - Chiana ! Leave him alone . Why do you wear that mask ? Dr. Diagnosan ... intuits disease through inhalation . Here . Very , very sensitive . Even the Siljot bacteria in your beautiful hair , would kill him , if he got it in his nose and his mouth at the same time . Crichton . A word , if I may . Not now , Rygel . Now works for me . So , if you haven 't chosen a bauble yet ... Rygel shut up ! - If I take you to him ... - I don 't wanna have them repaired ! He 's a surgeon . We have currency . - I 'm sure ... - Father , you 're not listening to me . - Alright , Rygel . I 'll take care of it . - Well , he just tried to force , - this chinka stone down my throat ... - What did I just say ? I can 't see why you wouldn 't want your tankas restored , - I mean , as a Luxan . - I 'm only half Luxan . And for many cycles , I didn 't even wanna be that . You cut yourself . You mutilated your own tankas . You hate me that much ? It 's okay . It doesn 't hurt anymore , Father . - Hey , D 'Argo ... - What ! Sorry , Chiana , ... A moment ago you said 17 . 5 . Expenses , experience , expertise . The meter is still running . - 20,000 is the rate . - I 'll pay 18 and not a Kretma more , got it ? I hate to negotiate like this , but I do find that it cuts through the krutatah . Put him down Greenchalk . Grunchlk . This is business . I have the supply , I make the demand . It 's alright , doctor . The family are in denial . I won 't let them hurt each other . Take the 20,000 ... before it goes up . Crichton ? Pilot says you 're reconfiguring a comm signal outside his control . I want to eavesdrop on Crais 's radio traffic without him knowing about it , I still don 't trust him here . Crais and Talyn saved our lives . They saved yours . Look , Aeryn , if you 're worried about that ... inside my head . Don 't . He 's under house arrest . Remember what you said ? " Strength " . That 's great , John . But you need to stop what you are doing . Aeryn , as long as I stay busy ... he leaves me alone . Sometimes if I sing , he leaves me alone . Look . Once the Diagnosian 's finished with Moya , he 's going to take a look at you . Won 't help . I am ... reminded at this point ... of a word that you actually brought to this vessel . " Hope " . I would be lost ... without you . Then you 'll never be lost . No matter what happens ... you have worked your way ... into my heart . You 've shown me that I have one . I love you . I love you , too . You are so ... my girl . Now , listen to me . Officer Sun cannot be blackmailed or enticed . If she is to join us , it would have to be of her own volition . Agreed . If she joins us freely , we will tell her the truth . What 's that coming through ? Identify the source of this signal ! Play it loud ! - It 's a Peacekeeper signal . - Crais says it 's a special pulse code , - known only to captain 's rank and above . - He 's never been a Peacekeeper ! It has to be the neurocircuit that Scorpius has planted ... What are we gonna to do when we find him ? You , nothing ! It 's too dangerous . Dad ... No ! Stop what you 're doing . Relax , boy . You 're not in any danger . Scorpius only wants me . My father says you 're in no condition to make that decision . And you 're in no condition to stop me . Step back ! Oh my . You really should have brought a pulse rifle . Like father , like son . Hardly . How to you feel ? Like a popsicle . Gotta love this sphincter end of the universe . They 're just gonna have a look , an examination . Make sure he puts the K - Y on the glove . What the hell are you doing here ? Meager gesture of support . While the others attend to Aeryn and Jothee . - Is there any permanent damage ? - Just their pride . - You seem remarkably lucid . - Don 't get too close . - I could turn any second . - We 'll fix it Crichton . Everyone 's pledged to give whatever it takes to ... I thought he couldn 't inhale our contaminants . You see the green light ? That 's a biological neutralizer . That is , you could have the Karatonga Plague in here ... wouldn 't touch him . Outside . Pick your nose , and he 's dead . No ... pain . Re ... lax . Frelling krutatah ! You 're gonna tell me my health plan doesn 't cover this , right ? Doctor doesn 't often say this ... there 's nothing he can do . That thing in his head ... he can 't get it out without killing him . D 'Argo , the surgeon said it 's a numbing anesthetic , okay ? So don 't breath too much and ... all right ? - And shake the cannister every couple of ... - All right already ! I remember ! - What 's the matter with you ? - What 's the matter with you ? Well , I 'm just ... I 'm trying to have a relationship . And you think I 'm not ? Listen , Chiana . You have to understand , - it has been so long since I 've seen my son . - D 'Argo , I know how long it is . There is no one , no one who has lived this dream of finding your son more than me . You gonna help , D 'Argo ? Couldn 't you wait a couple of microts , Stark ? I was talking to Chiana ! Tocot says we gotta put down another layer of Danlandium ... - Frell you ! - ... after the first has been absorbed . And you understand him . How many bodies did he say were in here ? I believe he said " frelling millions " . Aeryn , did I say or do anything to piss you off ? I mean , other than caving in the side of your head . Are you serious ? Do you not remember ? Splendid news for the patient . I think I found a biological match . What ? You found a human ? Well , it 's called an Interon . It 's bipedal . Central spine . Organs internal . Single heart circulation and a small head . I 've got three specimens . That 's the best I can do . There are over 5,000 different species frozen here . This is an abomination against nature . It 's not as though they 're suffering , love , is it ? Yeah . I mean ... They 're already dead anyway . - No , Aeryn , they 're still alive . - That 's a technicality . No . I 'm not accepting anything from someone who 's alive . They 're all accident victims and the like . I mean we freeze 'em a microt before their death 'cause the parts last longer that way . - You have interrupted the course of nature . - None of them would survive restoration . That is the Doc 's rules for accepting a donor . And you 've got three like me . Well . Similar . I mean , probably a species offshoot from the same stock . Is that possible ? We 're somewhere near Earth ? I don 't know . - I want this chip out . - Splendid ! ' Course , if it don 't work ... we get to keep your body . - That 's it , D 'Argo . - I can 't feel my tongue . - Who 's fault it that ? - Frell you . You know what my dad wants to do with his share of the money ? Buy a farm . Really ? He wants to grow Prowsa fruit and make wine . I don 't wanna live on a farm . I 've been a slave ... been chained in a mine . He wants to live the quiet life . I want to live loudly . Well , I didn 't know that . I guess it was gonna be just you two . - You too , Chiana . - Pilot , you 're high . I am no higher than I 've ever been . My position is fixed . No , I mean . The drug in Moya , it 's messing with your brain . He 's been using my DRDs to practice . Wanna see ? It 's a secret . " Chiana . " You know that I have to spend a lot more time with Jothee , so ... " I was hoping we could all find a quiet place and , ... " settle down together . " I was hoping you would consent to be my wife . " What ? What a surprise to find you eating . So , Gunshock . How long will it be before the surgeon can operate on Crichton ? Seven or eight arns . He wants to finish supervising the medication of your ship . He 's splendidly consciencious . Well , we 'll just keep Crichton restrained until you 're ready . - Good . Anything else ? - What are you up to ? Higher level reasoning , Aeryn . If a simple thought occurs , I 'll call you . As I was saying ... you must know your way around this backwater part of the galaxy . I know who I need to know . That 's a very small stone . Your savon surgeon says Moya won 't be able to starburst for some time . I 'm interested in securing other passage . There are some excellent choices available . It depends whether you require speed , stealth , or strength . That 's another very small stone . All three . It 's not impossible . That 's three very small stones . Splendid . Zhaan , what 's happening ? They 're treating one more tier , then the diagnosian wants you . Great . - Zhaan , listen ... - Yes , John ? Odds are that ... I 'm not gonna make it . - Positive spirits . I pray to the Goddess . - Yes , but ... Reality tells me . Your soul is troubled . When the chip 's not controlling me , my thoughts are lucid . There are so many things that ... I wanna say to my family and friends . If you could absorb these thoughts , you could find a way to get a message back to Earth . You want me to join with you in Unity ? I just want my dad to know . Concentrate on me . Hello , Delvian . Tenth Level Pa 'u . Pity . A Twelfth could break this bond . Time to pray . Unlike your institutional upbringing , my parents were compassionate , moral , emotional . I value those traits . They are beginning to emerge in you . Crichton may not survive . Moya may be permanently crippled . The others are contemplating their next move . You 're an officer and a strategist . Have you not planned yours ? Sounds like you have a suggestion . This ship , this emotional ship , needs guidance . Talyn has chosen you . And I agree with his choice . There is much that you can learn that will surprise you . What ? It 's Crichton . Relay us to Pilot . Crichton , why won 't you frelling answer ? Aeryn , don 't come after me , I 'm not in ... control . You will not shoot him down , Talyn . Crichton is broadcasting our position to Scorpius again , he must be stopped . Track me . Oh , and Crais ... Thank you . Wooo haaa ! Shielded message for Scorpius . Coordinates on specified frequency . Request immediate extraction . Talyn . Block and fragment his transmission as best as possible . Buy her some time . John Crichton to Scorpius . Limited flight capabilities due to the nature of this craft . Repeat . Request immediate extraction . You just called yourself John Crichton . Are you really John anymore ? Little lady . How 's the skull fracture ? Well , if I 'm not addressing Crichton , then I address the neurochip in his head . - At your service . - You 're in an unarmed vessel . I believe Scorpius 's mandate is for Crichton to remain alive . And I intend to see that he does . Given no other choices , I will shoot you down . I doubt it . Make no mistake . I believe you 'll pull the trigger . I just don 't believe ... you 'll hit anything . Focus . Focus your mind . Purge the memory . No ! Stark , he is no more ! His body shelters some horrific evil ! Crichton 's gone . Now , this is flying ! How 's the ride back there ? A little bumpy ? Weapons locked to your exhaust . I give you one last chance to stand down . AAh , the radiant Miss Officious . So sure . So confident in the void of space . Crichton was trained to fly in atmosphere against gravity . Welcome to our world , baby ! Aeryn , Crichton has often said he 'd rather die than fall to Scorpius . If you get the opportunity , don 't hesitate . - What makes you think I would ? - Because if our positions were reversed ... I would . As Crichton might say : " Yee - haw ! " Where the frell am I ? Lose your dance partner ? You don 't have enough fuel to last until Scorpius gets here . Depends on how close he is . Look , John ... if you 're even in there anymore , look at what you 're doing . You fail to understand the extent of your friends misery . He wants Scorpius to find us . He wants to end his pain . No . I 'll never believe that . Look Crichton ... Scorpius ... Whatever you are . Recognize atmosphere included , I am a superior combat pilot . Darling . Uncontested . So land your craft now , or I shall be forced to demonstrate that skill . You really would shoot your friend down , wouldn 't you ? - You know the answer . - Well then , I shall comply . Lowering landing gear . Officer Sun . Trust nothing ! Crais , she doesn 't need you to tell her that . Descending now . Terribly sorry . Didn 't see you there . I am under attack ! I repeat ! I am under attack ! Aeryn ! - Attempting to gain ejection altitude ! - I take it our encounter is terminated , Officer Sun . All options depleted . Requesting position track ! Climb ! Eject ! Ejecting now ! Well done , Officer Sun ! - Are you still concious ? - Frell you . Fireworks . Aeryn ! It 's all right D 'Argo . The descent brakes auto - ignited . I 'm all right ! Officer Sun . In deference to that part of Crichton which still cares ... I inform you that you descend not over solid ground ... but a frozen lake . He 's right . - D 'Argo , Crais , do you have my position ? - Affirmative . - I 've got you , Aeryn . Can you avoid it ? - Negative . - I go down where this chair takes me down . - Your jets will weaken the ice . I suggest separate before touchdown ! I repeat , separate before touch down ! Officer Sun ... Sun ... Officer Sun ... didn 't hurt ... . much . Aeryn ! Can you comply ? Negative . The harness is jammed . Your frelling tire must have damaged the mechanism ! Aeryn , listen to me . This is John . - Yeah , is it really you , John ? - Yes . Listen to me . You do not want to be in that chair when you set down . Well . This harness won 't release . I don 't have anything to break it ... - Aeryn . You have to get out of the damn chair ! - I don 't have any choice ! Come on , please . Do something . I don 't have any options . Baby , you 're not gonna die like this . I hope you meant what you said in the Neural Cluster ... I did . NO ! AERYN ! Crichton ! What have I done ? The goddess graciously receives to her bosom , all those who pass from this existence regardless of faith or belief . She holds , however , a special place for those who travel this life as a journey . Aeryn Sun , will surely harvest that favor . Her life was a series of strides toward enlightment . Casting off the chains of prejudice and hatred . Reaching beyond violence and bigotry . She sought a balance of lasting inner peace . In her name . You are more worthy of this . At peace , Aeryn . May the Goddess receive you with charity . Ahmet . May the Goddess sanctify your spirit . Ahmet . Ahmet . May the Goddess purify your soul . May the Goddess recite your name on the whispers of the wind . Ahmet . Amen . D 'Argo , give me your knife . Give me ... your knife . Aeryn , forgive me . I love you . I 'm ready . Are you sure you don 't want your friends here ? No , I don 't want them here . The Doc says , because of that thing in your brain , there 's no way you were responsible for what happened to that Sebacean . Yes , I am . Right . After the Doc 's cut the tendrils that have hijacked your brain , he 's gonna try and take out the neurochip completely . But he needs your help . What do I gotta do ? Because there is no template of your brain pattern on our database , he doesn 't know what bits of gray do what . So when he probes , you tell him . Right . - Where will you be ? - Anywhere else . I vomit when things get messy . Yes , Talyn . I too would have like to have shown Aeryn what we learned from this chip . I think it would have made her the happiest soul among us . - Everyone else is preparing to move on . - I know . Tragedy often heralds flight . - What are you going to do Zhaan ? - My concern now is for Moya and Pilot . If you are in agreement , Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan , it would be an honor and a pleasure , to share the future with you . This is ... what ? Critters . More close encounters . And ... this ? American politics , Nixon to Clinton . Lose it . Here ? All of my dogs . - Necessary ? - No , but keep it if you can . The ship that you wanted , will be on its way here shortly . - Thank you . - Service paid . Service rendered , I guess . - Too bad , he ? - Yes . But that 's life . Yeah . This ... section ? Keep ... this ? It 's too bad we don 't get to spend more time together . Yeah . My whole life I never stayed in one place long enough to ... build any real relationships . And I always stay too long . Jothee ? Chiana . Let 's stay close . Once we find out about John , we should discuss our future . Sure Dad . Wow ! Wormholes ... that 's it ! Good job ... from you ? - I should ... desist ? - No frellin ' way . Here ! Down there ! What the frell was that ? Return to the Maurauder . Inform Scorpius we 've successfully maintained our zero presence profile . Now ! Very ... bad . Speech close to ... neural implant . You 're gonna take my memories , and I 'm gonna talk gibberish ? Why not just take my mojo while you 're at it ? Remove ... chip ... then attempt ... replace you ... normal . What the hell . There 's no one I really want to talk to . Not much worth remembering . Take the damn thing out . I remove , then restore ... you . Very clever , Grunchlk . Accomplished ... chip removal . Now ... replace ... brain . Hello , Doctor . So good to see you again . No , quite the contrary really . My cooling apparatus is just as functional as the day you installed it . Eternal thanks . I am so sorry to disturb the sterility of your theatre but you no longer serve a purpose . What irony . Sensitivity to heal anything , but oneself . Well , Crichton . So much to say , and yet , such little capacity . I only hope , the wormhole technology I 've waited so patiently for makes more sense . Don 't need a translator microbe for that one , do we ? You 've cost me much . And I do not suffer dissapointment well . I condemn you John Crichton , to live . So that your thirst for unfullfilled revenge , will consume you . Goodbye .

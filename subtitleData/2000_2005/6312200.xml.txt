 PREVIOUSLY ON JEREMIAH ... I 'M TIRED . CAN I GO HOME NOW ? I LOVE YOU SO MUCH . MEAGHAN ! WE TRIED EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF FOR 16 YEARS . IT DIDN 'T WORK.IT 'S TIME FOR A CHANGE . WHAT 'S IN IT FOR US ? THE ALLIANCE HAS OPENED UP TRADE ROUTES BETWEEN A DOZEN STATES . SO FAR , WE HAVEN 'T HAD ANY TROUBLE BECAUSE WE HAVEN 'T TAKEN SIDES . THEY 'RE BUILDING AN ARMY . SO ARE WE . IF YOU 'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGHTO DEFEND YOURSELF , YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET . NOW , YOU 'RE STARTINGTO SOUND LIKE DANIEL ... ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVE . ( SMITH ) : GOD TALKS THROUGH ME . THE REASON I 'M HERE IS TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE . FOR ME FROM GOD . I DIDN 'T ASK FOR THIS , AND I DON 'T WANT THIS . IT 'S JUST ... THERE . OH , GOOD , MARKUS . WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? YOU 'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN MILHAVEN . WELL , THEY CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT ME FOR A FEW DAYS . YOU AND I NEED TO TALK . NOW 'S NOT A GOOD TIME . I 'M UP TO MY ASS IN ALLIGATORS . I GOT HALF A DOZEN REPS FROM DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WAITING TO SEE ME ABOUT GOD KNOWS WHAT . WELL , THE ALLIGATORS CAN WAIT , BECAUSE I 'M RUNNING OUTOF STUFF IN MILHAVEN . I NEED CONCRETE , I NEED PIPES , ELECTRICAL WIRE- - YEAH , YEAH . WE 'VE HAD TO DIVERT SOME OF THAT TO OTHER TOWNS FOR A WHILE . MILHAVEN HAS BEEN GETTING A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THAT STUFF . DISPROPOR--HEY ! LISTEN TO ME . THOSE PEOPLE ARE ON MY BACKBECAUSE OF PROMISESTHAT YOU MADE . I PROMISED THAT WE 'D REBUILD MILHAVEN , AND WE WILL , BUT WE 'RE NOT GOINGTO DO IT OVERNIGHT , OR BY WITHHOLDING HELP TO ALL THE OTHER TOWNS THAT WE 'VE PROMISEDTO HELP . LOOK , I 'M NOT UNSYMPATHETIC , OKAY ? I 'M NOT GOING TOLEAVE YOU HIGH AND DRY . CHECK AROUND THE BASE . SEE IF THERE 'S ANYTHINGTHAT WE CAN GIVE YOUTHAT 'LL HELP FOR NOW . IF NO ONE HAS DIBS ON IT , IT 'S YOURS . OH , GREAT , GREAT . YEAH , I 'LL CHECK ON THAT . HEY , KURDY , WHAT 'RE YOUDOING DOWN HERE ? BRIANNA HERE CALLED AND SAID I MAY WANT TO COME DOWN . WANTED TO BE HEREFOR THE UNVEILING , HUH ? SMITH ... I 'LL FEEL GOOD WHEN THIS THING 'S OFF . AS I MENTIONED WHEN THEY BROUGHT YOU IN , NONE OF US- - NONE OF THE STAFF HERE- - ARE TRAINED DOCTORS . WE 'RE ALL SELF-TAUGHT . YEAH , AFTER THE BIG DEATH , THERE WEREN 'T A LOT OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS AROUND . YOU GUYS DID A GOOD JOB . WHAT I 'M TRYING TO SAY IS ... THERE 'S ALWAYS A CHANCEWE COULD BE WRONG . WRONG ABOUT WHAT ? THE GUNSHOT WOUND YOU RECEIVED AT INNSMOUTH CUT ACROSS SOME CRITICAL JUNCTIONS . THERE 'S INFLAMMATIONS AND LESIONS ALL THROUGH THE NERVES IN THAT AREA . THAT 'S THE REASON YOU HAVEN 'T BEEN ABLE TO MOVE IT . YEAH , BUT THEY 'LL GROW BACK , RIGHT ? I FIGURED , WITH TIME AND ... THAT 'S WHAT I 'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY . SOME NERVE DAMAGE CAN REPAIR ITSELF SPONTANEOUSLY , OR OVER TIME , BUT THAT 'S EXTREMELY RARE IN CASES LIKE YOURS , WHERE THE DAMAGE WAS SO COMPREHENSIVE . IT 'S JUST NUMB . I MEAN , THE BINDINGWAS REALLY TIGHT , SO ... WE NEED TO KEEP IT IMMOBILIZED FOR THE TIME BEING , TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE TISSUE . WE WERE HOPING THERE 'D BE SOME SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT ON YOUR OWN , SOMETHING TO GIVE USA REASON TO HOPE , BUT- - WAIT A MINUTE.WHAT 'RE YOU SAYING ? THAT I 'M PARALYZED ? THAT MY ARM IS ... PARALYZED ? BARRING A MIRACLE , YOU 'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THAT ARM AGAIN . IT 'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE A STRANGE DISEASEWIPED OUT ALL OF THE ADULTS AND LEFT US KIDSTO FEND FOR OURSELVES . NOW I 'M MOVING AHEAD , THROUGH THE PAST . * I CAN 'T LET GO * I 'M HOLDING HOPE SO TIGHT * IT 'S HARD TO BREATHE WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD FALLS * * I 'M GONNA PUT THE STARS BACK BACK UP IN THE SKY * * LET THEM ALL JUST SHINE DOWN I 'M GONNA TRY * * I BELIEVE WE 'LL FIND THE WORLD TOGETHER * * THROUGH YOUR EYES * THAT 'S ALL I CAN SEE * I BELIEVE WE 'RE LOOKING AT FOREVER * * IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN BE FREE * * I BELIEVE * OH , HEY , KURDY.I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU , MAN . THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE DOWN AT THE CAFETERIA . YEAH , I CAME TOCHECK ON SMITH . FIGURED HE 'D NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO . IT 'S OKAY . IT 'S NO BIG DEAL . HOW 'S IT GOING , SMITH ? HOW 'S THE ARM ? JEREMIAH , THIS ISN 'T A GOOD TIME . THEY SAY IT 'S PARALYZED , BUT THEY COULD BE WRONG . YEAH ... COULD BE . THEY ARE SOMETIMES . AND IF NOT , IT 'S ALL RIGHT.I 'VE GOT A SPARE . IT 'S NO BIG DEAL , REALLY . OF COURSE , I PROBABLY WILL NEED TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT FOR THIS CAMERA- - A ROPE MAYBE- - SO I CAN HANG IT AROUNDMY NECK . WELL , I COULD FIND SOMEBODYTO DO THAT FOR YOU . THEN I 'LL ONLY NEED ONE HAND TO TAKE THE CAP OFFAND PUT IT BACK ON . THAT 'D BE GREAT , AND I SAY , AS LONG AS I HAVE ONE GOOD HAND , MY LOVE LIFE 'S INTACT . IT 'S NOT A PROBLEM . GOT IT ! GOT IT . LOOK , SMITH ... I KNOW YOU WERE THERE THE NIGHT LIBBY WAS KILLED , AND YOU GOT HURT BECAUSE YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD TO HELP HER . JEREMIAH ... I COULDN 'T BE THERE . YOU WERE THERE.YOU PAID THE PRICE.I OWE YOU . NO , YOU DON 'T . THAT 'S NOT YOUR DECISION . IT 'S MINE . ANYTHING YOU NEED ... JUST LET ME KNOW . JEREMIAH , YOU CHECK IN WITH MARKUS WHEN YOU CAME IN ? YEAH , HE 'S , UH ... YEAH , HE WAS IN A BAD MOOD . MUST BE SOMETHING BIG GOING ON . AND WE 'VE HAD FOUR CASES NOW WHERE SOME OF DANIEL 'S PEOPLE HAVE COME ACROSS THE BORDER , SET SOME OF OUR FARMS ON FIRE- - WE 'VE HAD TWO CONVOYS OF SUPPLIES HIT IN TWO WEEKS . WE TOOK CARE OF THE TEAM THAT WAS HITTING THE CONVOYS . THEY SHOULD BE SAFE FOR A WHILE . AND WHEN THEY DO COME BACK , WHAT 'RE YOU GOING TO DOTO HELP US ? WHEN WE SIGNED ON , YOU OFFERED US PROTECTION , BUT PROTECTION DOESN 'T MEAN SQUAT IF IT TAKES TWO OR THREE DAYS FOR YOUR PEOPLE TO SHOW UP , AND YOU 'RE STRETCHED THIN AS IT IS . OKAY , BUT YOU KNOW OUR RESOURCES HERE ARE LIMITED , PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF MANPOWER . THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF THOUSAND OF US LIVING HERE . SO WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO ? KEEP YOUR PROMISE . I DON 'T CARE HOW , AS LONG AS YOU DO IT , OR THIS ALLIANCE OF YOURS IS GOING TO DIE AT BIRTH . THEY 'RE NOT WRONG , YOU KNOW . I KNOW THEY 'RE NOT WRONG . IF THEY WERE WRONG , ALL THIS WOULD BEA HELL OF A LOT EASIER . WE OFFERED THEMPROTECTION . WE HAVEN 'T FOLLOWED UPAS COMPLETELY AS WE SHOULD . THERE 'S NOARGUMENT THERE . YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO , MARKUS . WE 'VE TALKED ABOUT IT . THAT 'S WHY YOU HAVE ME AND SMITH GETTING PEOPLE TO SIGN ON . YOU SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING- - I KNOW . WE 'RE NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES OF THIS . IT 'S TIME TO GO FLAT OUT . THEY 'LL NEVER GO FOR IT . IF THEY DON 'T GO FOR IT , THEN THERE 'S NO ALLIANCE , AND IF WE DON 'T GIVE THEM PROTECTION , THERE 'S STILL NO ALLIANCE , SO CHOOSE YOUR POISON , BECAUSE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT , IT 'S ALL BAD . YOU KNOW WHAT 'S FUNNY ABOUT ME , KURDY ? I HAVE TO PICK JUST ONE ? I LIKE PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER- - ALWAYS DID . SOME KIDS LIKE TAKING THINGS APART . ME , I LIKED PUTTING THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN . WHEN THE ADULTS DIED , AND WE TOOK OVER THIS PLACE , ANYTIME SOMETHING BROKE , THEY BROUGHT IT TO ME . IT WAS LIKE THIS GREAT ESCAPE , FIGURING OUT HOW A SLOTTED INTO B , FIXING C AND PLUGGING INTO D , AND SOON THE WHOLE THING WAS UP AND RUNNING AGAIN . I STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I WANTED TO PUTTHE COUNTRY BACKTOGETHER AGAIN . I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE INSERTING PART A INTO SLOT B , BUT ... IT 'S NOT . IT 'S LIKE PUTTING PERSON A INTO FOXHOLE B , AND SHOOTING PERSON C ... OR LETTING PERSON C SHOOT ... EVERYONE ELSE . I DON 'T LIKE SENDING PEOPLEOUT TO DIE , KURDY . THAT 'S NOT WHAT I SIGNED ON FOR . THAT 'S NOT WHAT I SIGNED ONFOR AT ALL . WHEN YOU JOINED THE ALLIANCE , WE PROMISED YOU PROTECTION NOT ONLY FROM DANIEL 'S GROUP , BUT FROM OTHER THIRD PARTIES . WE INTEND TO KEEP THAT PROMISE . GOOD . THAT 'S ALL WENEEDED TO KNOW . AS NOTED , WE HAVETHE WEAPONS , THE RESOURCES , AND THE SUPPLIES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN . WHAT WE DON 'T HAVE IS THE MANPOWER . THERE 'S ONLY A COUPLE OF THOUSAND OF US LIVING HERE . WE CAN 'T BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE , SO HERE 'S THE DEAL . YOU WANT AN ARMY , YOU 'VE GOT AN ARMY , BUT IT HAS TO BEA COOPERATIVE DEAL . HOW COOPERATIVE ? WE PROVIDE THE RESOURCES , THE TRAINING , YOU PROVIDE THE WARM BODIES . EACH GROUP THAT JOINS HAS TO KICK IN . WE 'LL WORK OUT A FORMULA- - SO MANY RECRUITS PER THOUSAND . YOU 'RE BEING UNREASONABLE . I 'M OPEN TO ANY OTHER IDEAS . AN ARMY NEEDS RESOURCES AND PEOPLE . WE HAVE ONE , YOU HAVE THE OTHER . AND IF WE SAY NO ? THEN YOU 'RE ON YOUR OWN . EVEN IF WE GO FOR THIS , HOW DO WE TALK PEOPLE INTO SIGNING UP ? WE OFFER THEM HOT MEALS , A PLACE TO SLEEP , TRAINING ... AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT EVERY NIGHT , THOSE THEY LOVE ARE AS SAFEAS WE CAN MAKE THEM . I 'D SAYTHAT 'S A PRETTY FAIR TRADE . SO ... WHAT DO YOU SAY ? WE CAN EITHER SIT AROUND ALL DAY COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS , OR WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT . IT 'S YOUR CHOICE . SO , WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR ARMY ? WELL , HALF OF THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVEN 'T EATEN IN DAYS , LIKE IF THEY HAD TOWALK ONE MORE DAY , THEY 'D PROBABLY DIE RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET . I HAVE A HUNCH THEY 'RE STRONGER THAN YOU THINK . THEY WANT THIS TO WORK . THEY 'RE TIRED OF GETTING THE SHORT END OF THE STICK . I THINK THEY WANT TO GET BUSY . I 'M TEMPTED TO ASK WHAT ALL THIS HAS TO DO WITH US , BUT EVERY TIME I ASK THAT QUESTION , I NEVER SEEM TO GET AN ANSWER I LIKE , MARKUS . RIGHT NOW , WE HAVE THE MEN AND THE WEAPONS . WE 'RE TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY . NEXT WE HAVE TO PUTTHE TWO TOGETHER , GIVE THEM THE TRAINING THAT THEY 'LL NEED SO THAT THEY CAN FIGHT AS AN ORGANIZED FORCE , AND A PLACE TO LIVE , BECAUSE WE SURE AS HELL DON 'T HAVE THE ROOM HERE . WAIT A MINUTE . KURDY , YOU HAVE PROVEN YOURSELF OVER AND OVER WITH THE MEN , WITH OUR RECENT MISSIONS- - YOU WANT ME TO TRAIN THESE GUYS ? TRAIN THEM , LEAD THEM- - DO I LOOK LIKE A GENERAL TO YOU ? NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT , YEAH , ESPECIALLY AROUND THE EYES . WHAT DO YOU THINK , JEREMIAH ? OH , I 'LL BE IN THE CAR . NO ... MARKUS , MARKUS , THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA . ALL I 'M ASKING IS THAT YOU GIVE IT A SHOT . WHAT 'S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN ? I CAN GET THESE GUYS KILLED . OR KEEP THEM ALIVE , BY TEACHING THEM WHAT YOU KNOW ... AND ONCE WE 'VE TRAINED THESE PEOPLE , WE 'LL START FARMING THEM OUT TO PLACES WE 'VE SET ASIDE ALL ALONG THE BORDER WITH DANIEL 'S GROUP , BUT THEY 'LL HAVE TO BE BUNKED DOWN AND FED AT A HALFWAY POINT , WHICH IS WHERE YOU COME IN , JEREMIAH . MILHAVEN ? NO WAY , MARKUS.I 'M PACKED TO THE ROOF.I GOT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE- - YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING- - THIS IS IT . RECRUITS COME HERE , WE TRAIN THEM , THEY GO TO MILHAVENFOR ASSIGNMENT , AND OUT FROM THERE . NO , I DON 'T THINK THAT 'S GOING TO WORK . WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME I COME UP WITH A GOOD IDEA- - MARKUS , MARKUS ... WHY IS IT EVERY TIME THAT I COME UP WITH A GOOD IDEA , YOU GUYS START RAZZING ME ? IT WAS NEVER A GOOD IDEA- - YOU WOULDN 'T KNOW A GOOD IDEA . THAT 'S THE PROBLEM ... EXCUSE ME . EXCUSE ME . I 'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU WHILE YOU 'RE ALL TOGETHER . SMITH , THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST TIME . THIS 'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE , I PROMISE . I KNOW THAT SOMEOF YOU , WELL ... PROBABLY ALL OF YOU ... DON 'T BELIEVE THAT I HEAR FROM GOD . YOU DON 'T BELIEVE THAT GOD 'S GOING TO GET MORE ACTIVE IN THE WORLD THAN HE HAS BEEN IN THE PAST . THAT 'S GOING TO CHANGE . GOD SPOKE TO ME TODAY . HE SAID ... " TELL THEM THAT I WILL OFFER PROOF . " TELL THEM THAT THEY MAY EACH " ASK FOR A MIRACLE , " A MIRACLE THAT WILL STAND AS TESTIMONY " TO MY PROMISE OF A BETTER WORLD TO COME . " TELL THEM TO COMETO THE APPOINTED PLACE , " AT THE APPOINTED TIME , " AND WAIT , " AND WHATEVER MIRACLE THEY ASK , IT SHALL BE GRANTED . " OF COURSE , IT 'S GOT TO BE A PRESENT MIRACLE , BECAUSE CREATING TIMETOOK SOME SERIOUS-ASS WORK , AND I DON 'T THINK HE WANTS TO MESS WITH IT . ( ARGUING ) WOULD YOU LOOK AT ALL THIS FOOD . DO YOU BELIEVE THIS PLACE ? IT 'S LIKE WALKINGINTO THE OLD WORLD . THEY 'VE GOTEVERYTHING . YEAH , REAL CUSHY . SO WHERE YOU FROM ? LAWRENCE , KANSAS . I 'M ED . GINA . OMAHA , NEBRASKA . SO , YOU A VOLUNTEER ? HELL , NO . THE WAY I HEARD IT , UNLESS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGEOF FOLKS SIGN UP , THE WHOLE TOWN GETS SCREWED , SO IT 'S EITHER COME HERE , OR GET THROWN OUT OF TOWN WITH NOTHING AND HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE . STINKS , BUT HEY ... AS LONG AS THEY FEED US , RIGHT ? ONLY REASON I SIGNED UP . HOW ABOUT YOU ? ME ? NO , THE GUYBEHIND YOU . VAIL , COLORADO.NAME 'S KENT . YOU VOLUNTEER , OR DID YOU GET VOLUNTEERED ? I SIGNED ON . AH ! ANOTHER MANIN SEARCH OF THREE HOTS AND A COT . NO . NO , I SIGNED ON BECAUSEI BELIEVE IN THE ALLIANCE , IN WHAT THEY 'RE TRYING DO HERE . I MEAN , SOMEONE 'S GOT TO CREATE THE NEW WORLD . BETTER THESE GUYS THAN SOME OTHER ONES I 'VE SEEN . NO WAY . WE 'VE GROWN UP ON OUR OWN . WE 'VE COME OF AGE . NOW IT 'S TIME FOR THE COUNTRY TO COME OF AGE . MAN , YOU 'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME . SPARE ME FROM DREAMERS , PLEASE . I 'M JUST SAYING- - IT 'S A JOB , MAN . IT 'S JUST A FREAKING JOB . YOU THINK IT 'S WRONGTO HAVE IDEALS ? I 'M JUST SAYING WHEN THINGS GET HAIRY , YOU CAN KISS YOUR IDEALS GOODBYE . THAT 'S RIGHT . YOU 'RE HERE TO DO A JOB , OR YOU AIN 'T . NOW , SOMEONE TRIES TO KILL ME , I 'M GOING TO KILL THEM FIRST , AND NOT BECAUSE OF SOME DOPEY IDEAL , BUT BECAUSE I WANT TO LIVE . YEAH , BUT- - HEY , JUST PASS ME THE SALT , OKAY , DREAMER ? WE ONLY GOT HALF AN HOUR LEFT TO EAT , AND I 'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANYTHING ON THIS PLATE . ANYWAYS , IT 'LL BE GOODTO MEET THE GUYS IN CHARGE . I 'M SURE THEY 'RE GIVING US THE BEST OF THE BEST . HI . I 'M KURDY . THEY PUT ME IN CHARGE . YOU READY TO DO THIS ? YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ? ALL RIGHT , YOU ... MAGGOTS ! STAND AT ATTENTION . MAGGOTS , STAND AT ATTENTION ! YOUR GUN IS YOUR FRIEND . I AM YOUR FRIEND . THUNDER MOUNTAIN IS YOUR FRIEND . THE THING ABOUT FRIENDS IS , THERE 'S SOME FRIENDS THAT YOU WATCH , AND ... ALL RIGHT , DROP ! GIVE ME 20 ... NO , NO ... 40 ... NO , NO ... 50 ! YOU GIVE ME 50 ! STRAIGHTEN THAT SHIRT ! SUCK IN THAT GUT ... MISS . 99 ... 100 . YOU SEE , IF I CAN DO IT , YOU ... MY JOB IS TO TRAIN YOU , NOT LIE TO YOU . NOW , WHAT YOU LEARN HERE WILL DETERMINEWHETHER OR NOT I CAN DO THE MOSTIMPORTANT PART OF MY JOB ... KEEPING YOU ALIVE . YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ? NOTHING , IT 'S JUST ... LOOK , EVERYBODY HERE HAS HAD TO HANDLE HIMSELF OUTSIDE . IT 'S NOT LIKE WE DON 'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS . SHE 'S RIGHT . SOME , OR ALL , OF YOU HAVE FACED PROBLEMS ON YOUR OWN , SAME AS ME . YOU 'VE HAD TO FEND FOR YOURSELVES , FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU 'VE GOT . MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE EVEN HAD TO FIGHT OFF RAIDING PARTIES , BUT I 'VE LEARNED THERE 'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAKING ON A BUNCH OF DISORGANIZED , JUMPED-UP RAIDERS , AND FIGHTING AN ARMY , AND FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THAT DIFFERENCE WILL GET YOU KILLED . SO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AROUND , PEOPLE . TAKE A GOOD LOOK , BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY , AS MANY AS HALF OF YOU WILL BE DEAD BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR . JEREMIAH , WAIT UP . HOW 'S IT GOING ? LOUSY . SO IS THIS A GOOD TIME , THEN ? WHAT 'S UP ? I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU 'VE GIVEN IT ANY THOUGHT . GIVEN WHAT ANY THOUGHT ? GOD OFFERED YOUA MIRACLE . NOT NOW , SMITH . IT CAN BE SMALL . IT CAN BE BIG . I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU , OKAY ? YOU 'RE JUST ... YOU 'RE , YOU 'RE ... I 'M NOT CRAZY ! YOU GET TO ASK FOR A MIRACLE , JEREMIAH . THAT DOESN 'T HAPPEN EVERY DAY . ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP AT THE APPOINTED HOUR , AND THE APPOINTED PLACE , AND IT 'LL HAPPEN . JUST LIKE THAT ? JUST LIKE THAT . WHAT COULD IT HURT ? JUST IN CASEI 'M NOT AS CRAZY ... AS I JUST SOUNDED . WELL , I DON 'T LOOK FOR QUARTERS UNDER MY PILLOW FROM THE TOOTH FAIRY , AND I DON 'T WISH ON FALLING STARS . I DON 'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES , SMITH , OKAY ? SO YOU 'LL JUST HAVE TO FINDSOMEONE ELSE TO TALK TO . I 'M VERY BUSY RIGHT NOW . WHAT 'S THE HARM- - NOT ME ! IF YOU ASK ME WHAT I WANT FOR A MIRACLE , I WOULD OPEN UP A DOOR STRAIGHT TO HELL . ALL RIGHT ! YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY " TALKING TO YOU IS LIKETALKING TO A WALL ? " WELL , THIS IS THE WALL THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT . ALL RIGHT , YOU MUST BE HUNGRY , BECAUSE I KNOW I SURE AM . SO HERE 'S THE DEAL ... I 'M GOING TO PICK SIX PEOPLE . ONE . TWO . THREE . FOUR . FIVE ... AND SIX . ONCE YOU SIX GET OVER THAT WALL , THEN WE BREAK TO EAT . ALL RIGHT , LET 'S GO . YOU GET OVER THE WALL , AND WE GET FED . YOU 'RE KIDDING , RIGHT ? YEAH , I 'M KNOWN FOR THAT . RIGHT . IT 'S TOO HIGH , MAN . IF YOU CAN 'TCONQUER A WALL , HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO CONQUER AN ENEMY ? GIVE ME A BREAK . ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS BULL , MAN ! NO , IT 'S NOT . YOU SAID WE COULDN 'T BREAK UNTIL WE ALL GOT OVER THAT WALL , BUT YOU DIDN 'T SAY WE HAD TO DO IT ALONE . NO , I DIDN 'T . SO YOU HAVE AN IDEAOF HOW TO GET OVER ? OKAY , YOU TWO ... LEAN UP AGAINST THE WALL , HANDS OUT . WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR ? YOU HEARD THE MAN . OKAY , NOW YOU TWO , GET ON THEIR HANDS . NO , NO . NO.STAY THERE . STAY THERE . KEEP STRADDLING THE WALL . NOW , THE GUYS ON THE WALL JUST ... JUST HELP EVERYONE ELSE OVER . YOU HELP THE OTHER GUY GET UP . HE GETS TO THE TOP , BUT HE DOES NOT LEAVE YOU BEHIND . HE STAYS AND HE HELPS YOU OVER BEFORE FOLLOWING HIMSELF . IT 'S NOT ABOUT THE WALL . IT 'S ABOUT YOU . ON THE OUTSIDE , YOU 'RE USED TODOING FOR YOURSELF , BUT HERE , YOU HAVE TO DO FOR EACH OTHER . YOU WORK TOGETHER , OR YOU DIE ALONE ... OR SOMEBODY ELSE DIES FOR YOU . THAT 'S HOW AN ARMY WORKS . SO GO AHEAD . FINISH UP . SO WHAT 'S WITH THE FLOWERS ? THIS LITTLE GIRL GAVE THEM TO ME WHEN I SIGNED UP . SHE SAID THEY 'D BE LUCKY , SO I KEPT THEM . I LIKE THEM . YOU KNOW , I SWEAR KURDY 'S TRYING TO KILL US . TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT , AND NOT A SINGLE BREAK . IT 'S JUST TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SURVIVE ONCE WE GET OUT THERE . OH , I 'M GOING TO SURVIVE , ALL RIGHT , BECAUSE END OF THE DAY , I 'M A FIGHTER . ANYBODY COMES AT ME , HE 'S A DEAD MAN . YOU 'LL PROBABLY SURVIVE TOO , DREAMER . DIFFERENT REASONS , OF COURSE . YEAH , HOW DO YOU FIGURE ? I 'VE SEEN YOUR KIND BEFORE . YOU THINK YOU 'RE REAL SMART , BUT WHEN THE SHOTS START FLYING , YOU 'RE GOING TO BE THE FIRST GUY TO RUN . SO WHY DON 'T YOU TAKE YOUR DREAMS , AND YOU SHOVE THEM . I 'M GOING TO GET SOME SLEEP . BECAUSE IF THERE 'S ANYTHINGI 'VE LEARNED FROM THIS , I AM NOT CUT OUT TO BE A TEACHER . THAT 'S YOUR GIG , NOT MINE . THAT 'S NOT WHAT I HEAR . I THINK YOU HAVE A NATURAL AFFINITY FOR THIS . NO , IF YOU THINK THAT , YOU 'RE EVEN CRAZIER THAN- - SMITH , HI . WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU . WE 'VE ONLY GOTA FEW DAYS LEFT BEFORETHE APPOINTED TIME . HAVE YOU DECIDED ON YOUR MIRACLE , EITHER OF YOU ? I ... NO , I DON 'T THINK SO . KURDY , WHAT ABOUT YOU ? I 'VE BEEN HANGING WITH YOU FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS , SMITH , AND I STILL DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL THIS . NOW , THERE 'S SOMETHING GOING ON WITH YOU , THAT 'S FOR SURE ... BUT THIS ? THEN ON THE OTHER HAND , WHY THE HELL NOT ? SO , IF I HAD TO ASKFOR ONE MIRACLE ... I LOOK AT THESE GUYS I 'M TRAINING , AND I KNOW THEY 'RE GOING TO FACE SOME HARD TIMES , BECAUSE WHEN THE OLD WORLD DIED , THEY LEFT ALL THESE GUNS AND WEAPONS JUST LYING AROUND . SO , IF I HAD ONE MIRACLE , IT 'D BE FOR EVERY GUN , EVERY NUKE , EVERY ROCKET , EVERY GRENADE , JUST EVERY WEAPON IN THE WORLD TO ... DISAPPEAR . LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD , YOU KNOW . KNIVES , TOO ? NO , KNIVES WE NEED . WE ALL GOT TO EAT , RIGHT ? THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU , SMITH ? OKAY , PEOPLE , LISTEN UP ... I 'VE GOT GOOD NEWS . TOMORROW , YOU GETTO GO BACK OUTSIDE . TOMORROW , IT 'S YOUR TURN . YOU FINALLY GETTO WALK IN THE SUN . OF COURSE , YOU 'RE GOING TO WALK ABOUT 10 MILES . YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AS A UNIT , AND YOU 'RE GOING TO LEARNHOW TO SCOUT AN OPEN FIELD , AND ONCE WE 'RE DONE WITH THAT , WE 'LL HAVE SOME WAR GAMES . YOU GET TO SHOOT AT EACH OTHER , AND NOBODY DIES . SOUNDS JUST LIKE KENT 'S KIND OF WAR . ( SNICKERING ) YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ? NO . SIR . GOOD . LET 'S KEEP IT THAT WAY . GET SOME SLEEP , PEOPLE.WE HEAD OUT AT DAWN . SO , HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE BEFORE THIS SO-CALLED APPOINTED DAY ? END OF THE WEEK ... SUNDAY . I WANT MEAGHAN BACK . ALIVE . WHOLE . UNINFECTED . IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR LAZARUS , IT 'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER . HEY , MAN . I HEARD YOU WAS GOING ON A LITTLE FIELD TRIP . MIND IF I COME ALONG , HELP YOU KEEP AN EYE ON THESE NEWBIES ? NO , THAT 'S COOL . THANKS . I NEED THE HELP . HEY ! DID I TELL YOUTO TOUCH THAT BOX ? YOU EVER HEAR THE WORD " EXPLOSIVES " WHERE YOU COME FROM , CHIEF ? OKAY , HERE IT IS . YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WANT ? I WANT TO SEE GOD . I WANT TO SEE HIM FACE TO FACE- - HIM , HER , IT , WHATEVER- - AND LOOK HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE , AND ASK HIM , " WHY 'D YOU SCREW THINGS UP ? " THEN I 'LL TELL HIM , FACE TO FACE , THAT HE 'S A THUG , MONSTER , HYPOCRITE ... HE 'S A KILLER . I 'M GOING TO SPIT RIGHT IN HIS EYE . ALL RIGHT , BREAK UPINTO TWO GROUPS . GROUP ONE , GROUP TWO . YOU 'RE GROUP ONE , GROUP TWO . YOU 'RE GROUP ONE . YOU 'RE GROUP TWO . GROUP ONE , YOU GO THAT WAY . GROUP TWO , YOU STAY WITH ME . SCOUT THE AREA , COORDINATE POSITIONS , AND REPORT BACK .

SEE HOW THAT WORKS . EXCUSE ME . WHAT ARE ... ARE YOU OKAY ? WE NEED TO TALK . THERE 'S A PROBLEM . COME ON , LET 'S GO TO MY OFFICE . HEY , KURDY , CHECK THIS OUT . HOLD UP , GUYS . LOOK , JEREMIAH , IF THIS IS ANOTHER WEIRD-ASS--NO , NO , NO . LOOK AT THIS . SOMEBODY 'S BEEN HERE BEFORE US . MILITARY BOOTS . YEAH . AND FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS , WE 'VE HAD PEOPLE GO MISSING , SOME OF OUR WINTER SUPPLIESHAVE BEEN STOLEN . IT COULD BE RAIDERS . NO . LATE YESTERDAY WE FOUNDONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DISAPPEARED . HE WAS BEING HELD IN A BURNT-OUT BOWLING ALLEY . THEY 'D HURT HIM , LEFT HIM FOR DEAD . IF WE HADN 'T FOUND HIM ... HE SAID HE WAS CAPTURED AND HELD FOR QUESTIONING BY AN ADVANCE SCOUT TEAM FROM DANIEL . FIVE , MAYBE SIX MEN , WELL ARMED . CAN YOU SHOW ME EXACTLYWHERE THEY 'VE HIT ? HERE , AND THROUGH HERE . YOU 'RE SURE ? YES . WHY ? WE JUST SENT SOME OF OUR PEOPLE INTO THAT AREA . I HAVE TO GET TO A RADIO , FAST . ( KURDY ) : STAY BACK ! COME ON . THERE ARE TWO OF THEM , MAYBE MORE ! SPREAD OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN . IF WE 'RE BUNCHED UP , IT 'S EASIER FOR THEM TO HIT SOMEBODY . WHERE THE HELLARE YOU GOING ? COSTA ! OH , MY GOD.OH , MY GOD . FORGET THIS , MAN ! I 'M GETTING OUT OF HERE . WE HOLD THE LINE ! YOU HOLD IT . I 'M OUT OF HERE ! ED ... NO ! GET HIM OUT OF HERE . WHAT ? HE STAYS , HE DIES ! GET HIM OUT OF HERE . I 'LL COVER YOU . KENT , COME ON . LET 'S GO ! COME ON ! GO ON ! I 'LL BUY YOU AS MUCH TIME AS I CAN . GO ! KENT ! MAKE SURE HE GETS BURIED WITH THIS , ALL RIGHT ? YOU WORK TOGETHER , OR YOU DIE ALONE . OR SOMEBODY ELSE DIES FOR YOU . YOU KNOW KENTWAS JUST GRANDSTANDING . HE WAS TRYING TO SHOW EVERYBODY HOW SUPERIOR HE WAS . I MEAN , GUYS LIKE THAT ... IT 'S INEVITABLE . YOU SAIDWE COULDN 'T BREAK UNTIL WE ALLGOT OVER THAT WALL , BUT YOU DIDN 'T SAYWE HAD TO DO IT ALONE . NO , I DIDN 'T . SO YOU HAVE AN IDEAOF HOW TO GET OVER ? IT 'S NOT ABOUT THE WALL.IT 'S ABOUT YOU . ON THE OUTSIDE , YOU 'RE USEDTO DOING FOR YOURSELF BUT HERE , YOU HAVE TO DOFOR EACH OTHER . YOU WORK TOGETHER , OR YOU DIE ALONE . YOU 'RE LEAVING ? GOT TO GET BACK TO MILHAVEN NOW THAT I GOT THE SUPPLIES I CAME FOR . BUT TODAY 'S THE APPOINTED DAY . YOUR MIRACLE , REMEMBER ? SORRY . I THOUGHT YOU WANTED A CHANCE TO SPIT IN GOD 'S EYE . IF THERE IS A GOD , AND I DON 'T THINK THERE IS , THERE 'LL BE TIME FOR THAT LATER . MAYBE . YOU KNOW , FIRST I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST AFRAID THAT YOUR MIRACLEWOULDN 'T COME TRUE , BUT NOW I THINK YOU 'RE AFRAID YOU WILL GET YOUR MIRACLE , BECAUSE IF YOU DO , THEN YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ... RECONSIDER EVERYTHING . YOU THINK WHATEVER YOU WANT . YOU KNOW SOMETHING ? I WANT TO KNOWWHAT YOU ASKED FOR . WHAT MIRACLE DID YOU ASK FOR ? TO USETHIS ARM AGAIN . THAT 'S IT ? ALL THE THINGSYOU COULD ASK FOR- - THAT 'S IT ? I TRAVEL LIGHT . MARKUS , KURDY , THERE YOU ARE . SMITH , WE HAVE TO STOP MEETING LIKE THIS . PEOPLE WILL TALK . IT 'S MIRACLE DAY.ARE YOU GUYS READY ?

WELL , THE MALE MOSQUITOES ARE THE ONES THAT BUZZ , BUT THEY DON 'T BITE . THE FEMALE MOSQUITOES BITE , BUT THEY DON 'T BUZZ . SO IF YOU HEAR BUZZING IN YOUR EAR , YOU 'RE OKAY . IF YOU DON 'T HEAR ANYTHING ... WORRY . YOU MADE THAT UP . NAH . SO WHAT DO YOU HEAR ? I DON 'T KNOW ANYMORE . ( BUZZING ) HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE TO WAIT HERE ? UNTIL HE SHOWS UP .

IT WAS HIS CHOICE . HE COULD CHOOSEWHATEVER HE WANTED . HE CHOSE--ONE PERSON . ONE ... ONE ... THIS IS RIDICULOUS . NO , IT 'S- - NO , IT IS ! IT 'S RIDICULOUS . WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING HERE ? I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT I 'M DOING HERE . WE 'VE GOT PEOPLE WOUNDED AT THUNDER MOUNTAIN . I 'M IN THE MIDDLE OF BUILDING A FREAKING ARMY . WE 'RE ON THE CUSP OF A WAR WITH DANIEL 'S GROUP , AND I 'M STUCK HERE IN A SWAMP , IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ... BEING EATEN ALIVE . WHY ? I 'LL TELL YOU WHY . BECAUSE I LOVED HER ... BECAUSE I DIDN 'T WANT TO LET GO , BECAUSE I HAVEN 'T LET GO , EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME . I DIDN 'T LET MYSELF TALK ABOUT HER . I DIDN 'T THINK ABOUT IT , I ... SHE 'S GONE . SHE 'S GONE . SHE 'S GONE . I DON 'T THINK I REALIZED , UNTIL RIGHT NOW , HOW BADLY I WAS HOLDING ON , OR HOW MUCH I NEED TO LET HER GO , OR I CAN 'T BE WHAT SHE WANTED ME TO BE , WHAT SHE COULD NEVER BE , LOCKED IN THAT ROOM ... FREE . I SHOULD HEAD BACK . THEY NEED ME BACK AT THE MOUNTAIN . THAT 'S , UH ... QUITE A METAPHOR YOU GOT HERE , SMITH . WANDERING AROUND IN THE MUCK AND MUD OF MY OWN CONSCIENCE , FOR FAR TOO LONG . TIME TO GO . YOU 'RE LEAVING , TOO ? COME ON , SMITH . LOOK , WHEN YOU GOT MARKUS TO COME ALONG , I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE DOING . YOU KNEW JEREMIAHWOULD CUT OFF HIS LEFT FOOT BEFORE HE WENT ALONG WITH EVEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WAS A GOD , BUT MARKUS ... YOU GAVE HIM SOMETHING HE NEEDED . YOU DID GOOD , SMITH . YOU KNEW WHAT MARKUS WOULD ASK FOR . NOW , LET 'S GO . I 'M STAYING . YOU 'RE KIDDING . NO . ALL RIGHT , YOU WANT TO PLAYTHIS WHOLE THING OUT SO NOBODY CAN SAY YOU DIDN 'T , YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD , BUT I 'M GOING BACK WHERE IT 'S WARM AND DRY , AND I CAN STOP PRETENDING THAT THESE THINGS ARE NOT EATING ME ALIVE . GOOD NIGHT , KURDY . I 'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING . SO , WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS OF THE THUNDER MOUNTAINIRREGULARS ? THEY LOOK GOOD , BUT IT 'S THE ARMY OF THE WESTERN ALLIANCE . YEAH , WHATEVER . IT WAS A RUSHED PROGRAM , BUT WE GOT THERE . NOW , ONCE WE 'VE GOT THESE GUYS TRAINED IN THE BASICS , I FIGURE WE CAN GET THEM TEACHING THE OTHERS , WHILE WE WORK TO GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL . HEADS UP ! YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED , KURDY . YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE STAYED .

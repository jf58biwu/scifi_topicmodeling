 We saw the Earth destroyed . And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . There 's no end in sight to the record heat wave baking the entire state . Denton had a high today of 105 , Killeen with 108 , Aurora , 106 ... and it only gets worse as you head west . You lost , mister ? What makes you think I 'm lost ? We don 't get many strangers out this way . I guess you could say that I 'm trying to find out if I am lost . I 've seen it all before , this gas station , this church . I 've seen it all before . - You 've been summoned . - Summoned ? Yes . I suppose I have . How 'd it happen for you ? Interesting choice of words . Well , let 's say , I was engaged in my usual Thursday night activity . You almost make me believe in heaven , darling . - Did I make you see God ? - Well , let 's not get carried away , shall we ? Harder . And they say adult films are not a viable form of art . - You going ? - Yeah , got to be somewhere . - Don 't we all ? - What 's the problem ? Isn 't this the point where you fall asleep ? Yeah , but I was thinking maybe we could try something new ... - like , for instance , breakfast and talk . - Talk ? What do you wanna talk about ? How about the latest developments in recombinant DNA research ? - How 's that ? - I 'll take a rain check . Pity . I was really interested in hearing your take on it . Yeah , I 'm sure . Call me . Right . Harder . Oh ! - Hello ? - Hey , it 's me . Hi . Hi . I was just wondering what you were doing right now . - What am I doing ? - Yeah . Do you have any plans tonight ? - I have a guest over . - Oh . Is this the kind of guest that might be leaving before sunrise ? - That 's none of your business , Kurt . - Yes , of course . Of course . - Look , I gotta go . - Right , right . Of course . Have a nice , lovely , lovely , lovely evening . Cleanse me . " Evil shall slay the wicked , and they that hate the righteous ... " shall be desolate . " The Lord redeemeth the soul of the servants ... " and none of them that trust in Him ... " shall be desolate in the hills . " You know , when I first saw that symbol I felt ... I can 't explain it , but I felt that life didn 't have to be filled with emptiness ... that there had to be an answer somewhere , and that somewhere is here . I had a clear image of this place , this town , that I had to come . - And here I am . - Hallelujah ! Is that the word for it ? I don 't know . It 's the best I can think of . Can 't you ? No . I suppose not . You 'll need a place to stay . Chaldean 's Hotel . It ain 't much , but it 's the best we got . Don 't worry , Dr Mendel . You 're in the right place . Thank you . Thank you . Hello . My name is Kurt Mendel . I 'd like to have a room , please . How long will you be staying ? I 'm not sure , really . Need a checkout date . Policy . How long you be staying ? Until the end of this world or the beginning of the next . Works for me . Any showers in the rooms ? One bathroom at the end of the hall ... no hot water . Free cable , mints on the pillow , complimentary breakfast in the morning ? No TV , no mints . Breakfast is where you can find it . Sounds wonderful . That 's reassuring . - I won 't read this copy . - You 'll read it ... because you 're a professional , because you work for me ... - and because you like your job . - It 's degrading . We 're looking to attract a larger female audience . Like this ? This guy has a huge following . His tapes are flying off the shelves . Chad , you gotta listen to me , okay ? The press is going to blast us . Any amount of respect that we have gained is gonna fly out the window . In this business , sometimes you have to choose between respect and ratings . - The ratings are gonna go up not one iota . - How do you know ? - I know . - Yeah , well , you better hope ... your crystal ball is off this time ... because if these ratings don 't improve ... we 're gonna have to take a long look ... - at some other solutions . - Like what ? Like the anchors . And today we welcome the newest member of the Action Edition News team ... Warren Sunn , our very own " Workout Weatherman . " Thank you , Sarah . Great to be aboard . Warren , everybody seems to be talking about the weather . Some say this is the worst heat wave in Texas history . You are so right . So I hope you don 't mind if the rest of Texas heats up , if I cool down a little . Every day we 're gonna add a new exercise to our routine . Today we 're gonna start off with a simple , basic bicep curl . Two sets , three times a week , and you 'll build a blazing set of biceps ... that are gonna make your partner hot , hot , hot . Speaking of heat , there is no end in sight to this tempestuous , tumultuous ... temperature tantrum being thrown by Mother Nature . A low-pressure heat wave that 's responsible ... for some of the highest temperatures this century . There 's something very wrong , you guys . This heat , it shouldn 't be happening . One thing my granddaddy told me , honey ... - you can 't change the weather . - Yes . But that 's exactly what I 'm talking about , okay ? Our minds can go back in time ... but the weather should remain the same as it was . Is it my imagination , or are you a little ripe ? - Kid hasn 't taken a shower in a week . - Hey , hey . We 've got global warming , which is a fact , which has a major ecological impact ... and this is a drought . And the State of Texas Environmental Commission ... has asked us to cut back on water use , i.e. , take less showers . I am taking towel baths to which we all , as astronauts , should be accustomed . - Has anyone heard a word I 've said ? - Yeah . You 've been complaining about the goddamn weather ... which I would prefer to enjoy in the company of my own air conditioning ... in my own goddamn home . Is that why you dragged us 40 miles out here in the heat ? Well , if you put a gag in it for just a second ... I 'll tell you exactly why I dragged you here , Taggart . - This weather , this heat , it 's unnatural . - Sarah , it 's the southwest . - We get droughts . - Yes , but not like this , and not at this time . Oh , who can remember the goddamn weather five years ago , anyway ? I can 't remember what it was a week ago . Well , that 's because you 're a man . You can 't remember shit . Are you relying on this goofy weatherman the station just hired ? Yes . He 's exactly why I know something is wrong , okay ? And I 'm gonna tell you why . In the previous timeline , the ratings were in the basement . Now they 're through the roof . It 's because everybody 's watching this bozo ... trying to figure out what 's going on with this drought . - Oh , my God . - What ? She 's right . It 's not supposed to be hot at all . What 's it supposed to be ? It 's supposed to be raining . Shit . All right , hang on . Coming . Okay . Hello ? Dad , is that you ? What is it ? Dad , what 's wrong ? Day after tomorrow is Willis Jensen 's birthday party . He 's my father 's campaign manager . Something awful happened on that day . I know it was raining all week . All right . So something 's been fucking with the goddamn weather . What the hell does that mean ? We 're the wildcards in this timeline , so it must have been something we 've done . Changed the weather . I don 't think so . Hell , we 've been pissing in the timeline stream long enough . Maybe it 's something reacting to something we 've done . - Like a Sentient ? - Who knows ? - Kurt might have an idea . - Where the hell is Mr Science , anyway ? This is his turf . He should be here . Look , he called me yesterday . I couldn 't talk to him . I called him today to tell him about the meeting . Got his machine . Maybe he 's off doing something really important . Flip a coin . Heads , he 's betting the horses , tails , he 's cornered some ... Tail ? Didn 't mean to alarm you last night , Doctor . Try to greet all the newcomers . - Help them through the transition . - Transition ? Well , it can be tough on some of the participants . They 've given up a lot to be here . Some left their families behind , loved ones . Luckily , I don 't have that problem . Oh , it 's just as well then . There seems to be more water here than the whole state of Texas . This is a chosen place . You know , we 've been waiting for you . You 're the final piece to the puzzle . Last chapter in a glorious book . The King made him a great man . Made him the ruler over the whole province of Babylon . - Book of Daniel . - You know your Book , Dr Mendel . Funny enough , I seem to know it quite well lately . He burnt his words into the souls of his chosen people . But none like my little Brianna , my granddaughter . Chosen to be his eyes and his ears . Truly a miracle . Gonna get a kick out of this . I just opened it two minutes ago . " There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets ... " and maketh known to the king what shall be in the last days . " Daniel , chapter two , verse one through six . " I have gone to join Him in all his glory . " - You got this from Kurt ? - Yeah , I know . It 's gotta be a joke , right ? No . He don 't joke with you . He jokes with me . I think Angela 's right . He 's gone off to chase some girl ... who happens to be very religious . I don 't know . - What 's with that symbol ? - I 'm not sure . It looks familiar , though . I think I saw it on some heavy metal album cover . Well , I 'll tell you what . This could be one of his jive-ass jokes ... or this could be something real serious . So I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna go over to his loft . Meanwhile , you stay here and work on this symbol . It 's what I live for . Kurt , it 's Chuck . Call me . Honey , I 'm gonna be about an hour late for lunch ... and what happened to my hat and glasses ? I left them right here . - Can we talk ? - Can you handle it ? Actually , I 'm having a little trouble with that . That 's what I want to talk about . Okay . I went to see a therapist today . I told her about this . Oh , Lord , Paige ... - You need help , Chuck . - Oh , no . Paige , I thought there was one small possibility ... like you said , that you could believe what I told you was true . I 'm sorry . I just don 't . Paige , a goddamn shrink ... Do you know what the hell ... Do you know what the hell you 've done here ? If some goddamn shrink starts babbling about this ... - She won 't . Client confidentiality . - You don 't have any idea what you have ... Paige , I may need help . I may need goddamn scientific help . I may need spiritual help , but I don 't need a fucking shrink . Paige , if you 're home , pick up the phone . If I need some help , I need your help , baby . Dad ? Oh , my God . I 'll get a flight right away . Tell Mom I love her , and I will get there as soon as I can get a plane . - I 'm going to Arizona . It 's my mom . - She 's had a heart attack . I know . - Did you talk to Dad already ? - No . I lived through it all already . With you , five years ago in my time , which is now . They think it 's a heart attack . It ain 't a heart attack . It 's acid fucking reflux . That 's it . Acid reflux . Listen to me , Paige . It 's gonna be a bad two days ... but you 're gonna get a call from your dad tomorrow . He 's gonna tell you Mom ain 't got a heart attack . She 's just got an acid problem . Hold off on Arizona for one day . Can you do that ? If your dad doesn 't call , you can lock me up as a ding-a-ling and throw away the key . But he 's gonna call , and he 's gonna tell you your mom 's all right . Hold off on one day . Your mom 's fine . Can you trust me ? Overnight the Book was revealed to her , word for word , from Genesis to Revelations . And it was she who told us to build the Lord 's tunnel maker over here . I 'm Alex Stratton . Oh , yes . From the Weiseger Institute of Theoretical Physics . Good to see you again . It truly is a marvel . Looks like gold . There 's some gold in it , as well as silver , brass , iron , even clay . All materials prescribed by the Lord . That suction mechanism seems to be aspiring all the moisture from the air . Yes . It 's altering the atmosphere roughly in a radius of 300 miles . That 's not possible . With Him , all things are possible . If you examine certain biblical passages ... you 'll see that most of His interactions with man took place in the barren desert . - The Lord wants it hot and dry . - But why ? Well , for His arrival . Tonight at midnight , we activate the holy device . And a passage will be made , a bridge between His realm and ours . The Lord will cross through , and we 'll meet Him face to face . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Let 's slow down . His arrival ? Hot and dry ? Why does the Lord need a passage ? It doesn 't make any sense . - It doesn 't have to make sense . - Yes , it does . We were brought here for a purpose , and we should know it . Something brought us here in the interest of something bigger than science . - There has to be a reason for it . - There is . The scales have fallen from their eyes . Let them fall from yours . What do you mean ? Life doesn 't have to be composed of emptiness and unanswered questions . Give me your hands . You 've been lonely . You 've struggled to stop the loneliness ... but everything you 've done has taken you farther and farther away . - Yes . - You 've been called here for a reason , Kurt . Here there is fulfilment and answers . I want answers . When the Lord comes , you 'll have all the answers ... to all the questions you 've ever had , and you 'll never be lonely again . Hallelujah . Hallelujah . Well , folks , still no relief on the horizon . Record breaking scorcher continues unabated . Sarah , what are you doing to stay cool ? Just watching you do the weather gives me a chill , Warren . Look at her face . It 's so obvious she hates the guy . This does not sound like Kurt . And what does this symbol mean ? It 's a Babylonian icon . It means , " The Almighty . The all-knowing one . " - God ? - So to speak . Yeah . Listen , have you gotten an e-mail from Kurt or anything on a computer ? No . I think you guys should check out his loft . Hell , I did . I went over there . It 's locked up tighter than a drum . Try the front window . He leaves that open just in case he loses the key . - Let 's go . - Yeah . You coming with ? No . I gotta handle this stuff with my dad . Need any help ? I gotta see this through myself . Okay . Daddy ? What happened ? I was on my way to Willis ' party , and it was raining so hard , Angela . You couldn 't see anything , it was raining so hard ... - What happened ? - I was a little late . So I was driving kind of fast . I was fiddling with the radio , trying to find the 7 : 00 news ... and this damn fool runs across the dark road right in the middle of the rain . Oh , my God . I mean , why would somebody do that ? It 's so stupid . Had you been drinking , Dad ? I had a couple of cocktails before I left . Hey , it wasn 't strong . It was no big deal . Why didn 't you have your driver with you ? It was a private party , and , besides , it was Bryson 's day off . Who did you hit ? I mean , who would 've been out on that road ... - late at night like that ? - I don 't know . Was it a ranch hand , a farmer ? There 's construction down the road . There 's that park . I don 't know . I wanted to stop and see if he was all right , but ... - You left him out there ? - Well , yeah . That would 've been the end of everything . - I 'm gonna call the police . - No , you are not . It was an accident , but I was drinking . Now use your head , girl . You know what will happen . Listen , he could have just been wounded or not very seriously hurt . I think that is the case , so I think we can settle this privately . But I need you , Angela , to go back to that spot of the accident ... and see what you can find . Please , honey . You gotta do this for me . Angela , you gotta help me , please . Please . - Get my fucking foot out of the window ... - I 'm trying , Dad . - You got to straight ... Bend your knee . - Get the fuck , fucking ... - Dad ? Oh , shit . - Damn it . Damn . I told you to let me go first . Smart-ass fucking kid . Hey . We are looking for something that might tell us where he went ... not what he does in his spare time . Yeah , sorry . Hey , look at this . A Bible in Kurt 's loft . It is the end of the world . What do you make of Lost Hills , Texas ? What do you make of this ? So what do we got ? A meticulous guy who doesn 't make his bed ... don 't even eat his caviar for breakfast ... leaves the morning doobie , glass of wine . Got the symbol , Bible ... and a damn map of Lost Hills , Texas . We should check it out . Take about four hours to get up there . It 's north of the Big Thicket near Silsby . Let 's do it . You think you and I can survive four hours cooped up in a car together ? - Did three days in the shuttle . Sure . - Well , I don 't . You got five minutes to get in Kurt 's shower and get that stench off you . And I don 't wanna hear about the towel baths ... and the eco-impact and the goddamn global warming and all the other tripe . Lost Hills . Yeah . We made a wrong turn off the 96 . What was your first clue ? We 're on a goddamn ranch road . Of all the fucked up times for a radiator hose to bust . What the hell is Kurt doing out here ? Hell if I know . It ain 't the French Riviera . No , it ain 't . It 's nice though . I like it . It 's timeless . Reminds me of the Old West . You know , cowboys , Comanches . Son , Comanches were the greatest horsemen in the world ... and they were not in East Texas . They were in the great plains of West Texas . The only moccasins around here were the water type . Let 's get the hell out of here . - Hello . - Neil , let me talk to your dad . Yeah , hold on . It 's Mom . - Hi , baby . - Where are you ? Well , I 'm somewhere near Silsby . Silsby ? What on earth are you doing there ? Well , it 's what I told you about before . I mean , it 's a friend of mine , Kurt Mendel . You know him , and he 's in trouble ... and come up here for a couple of days . I got Neil with me . You took Neil out of school for two days ? Paige , it 's Sunday , and this is a priority . My dad didn 't call today , Chuck . I booked a flight for Arizona tomorrow afternoon . Paige , I mean , I may have screwed up about the day . Maybe it 's one day . Maybe it 's two days or more . I mean , it 's five years ago in my time . Can you just hang on for one more day ? Your dad will call . Trust me . Just hang on for one more day . I have had it . Chuck , I 've just simply had it . I 'm going to Arizona . And I don 't know if I wanna see you when I get back . I love you , Paige . My mother 's had a heart attack , Chuck . Goodbye . Shit . Let 's go . You 're a geneticist . Your purpose is for after the arrival . - After ? - The Lord will put you to use ... on the second day of His coming . For the Lord said , " This is my covenant to them . " But someone has broken the covenant . Someone here has broken the covenant . Come forward and admit to what you have done . I contacted my family . I miss my wife , my kids ... people I love . The Lord was very clear in His guidelines . No contact with non-believers . No exceptions . I just wanted to hear their voices . I didn 't tell them anything . I swear . I didn 't tell them anything . They 're scared . They 're suffering and they 're scared because I 'm here , and it 's so hard . I love the Lord . That 's why I came here . Stone him ! I came here all the way from Nuevo Laredo to serve Him ... to work for Him , to ... Back to work . We cannot fall behind . Tonight will be the most glorious night in history . We must now do the Lord 's work . We must continue . We have little time . Please , go back to work . Back to work . Amen , brothers and sisters . Keep working . The Lord is watching . We must keep His work going . We have little time . Midnight tonight . Dad , I 'm your daughter . You had me following blood trails into the woods . - Yeah , but there was no body . - We don 't know that . - So he walked off under his own power . - Or someone picked him up . Well , then we 'll check the hospitals . All right ? - You mean I gotta check the hospitals . - Yes . Dad , he could 've got your licence plate number . - No . It was pouring out there and pitch dark . - We are reporting this now , Dad . What we are going to do ... is we are going to have faith and wait ... and not cause any unnecessary police investigations or lawsuits . That 's what we 're gonna do . I checked the hospitals , the free clinics , the morgue . Nothing . To this day I don 't know what happened to the person he hit . Why don 't you just let yourself off the hook ? My family , everything revolves around the Senator . Whatever he needs . Whatever best serves his cause . - Sarah . - Warren , what are you still doing here ? - Go home . - Just going over these satellite charts . This weather system 's highly anomalous . Here , take a look . This drought , this heat wave , they seem to have an epicentre . Very odd . See , Oklahoma 's got rain . Louisiana , New Mexico are temperate . But we 're here baking like little pigs in a blanket . - And that 's really unusual ? - Almost unheard of . But I 've dealt with plenty odd weather in my time . Dust devils , squall lines , back door fronts , down slope flows . But nothing remotely like this . Jesus , Warren , you really do know your shit , don 't you ? Yeah , don 't let the muscleman jazz fool you . I got my Master 's in meteorological science at Johns Hopkins . Johns Hopkins ? Yeah , you 'd think it 'd be enough . Not in this world . I cooked up that workout shtick 'cause I couldn 't get a job . Who 'd have thunk it ? Warren , you said that the anomaly had an epicentre . - Can you pinpoint that for me ? - Yeah , sure thing . It 's right here . Where ? Show me . - Anything interesting ? - The whole damn book . - Yeah . I meant in relation to Kurt . - Nebuchadnezzar . - The King of Babylon . - I knew I raised a smart kid . That 's right . That icon is Babylonian . So you got King Nebuchadnezzar II , who was a sixth century King of Babylon ... enslaved the Israelites . Whereupon , Prophet Daniel was asked to interpret a dream for him . It 's Sarah . Yo , how 's my favourite big-name anchorwoman ? You 're never gonna believe this . This guy actually knows what he 's talking about . - Who ? - The Workout Weatherman . Okay ? Now , see the last time around we had no funky weather . So all he did was dance and prance and make an ass out of all of us . So you called me to bullshit about the geek weatherman . - You 're not listening to me , Taggart . - I 'm listening , I 'm listening . Go ahead . Okay . Here 's the thing . He found a ground zero . A place where the heat wave seems to be originating . - Three guesses as to where that is . - You 're shitting me . No . I 'm not shitting you . You 're heading right towards it . I have no idea what it means , but I just thought you should know . That 's why you 're my favourite big-name anchorwoman . Stay in touch . This is getting real interesting . Quite the hopping burg , isn 't it ? This town 's so small , you get a hard-on , you have to move the house . There 's his car . Hey , you hear that ? My friends , at long last our work is done . Amen ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Tonight at midnight ... the Lord will venture forth through the passage that we have created ... and walk among His chosen people . I 'm here to tell you , Brianna was contacted by our Lord ... within the past hour . She has some important things to share with her brothers and sisters . Yea , Brianna . Speak to us . Blessed friends ... bring forth thy seed from the east and gather thee from the east . The new dawn is arriving . Great changes are about to take place . Those who help us , like the men of science who 've heeded the call ... will bathe in His blessings . Those who oppose us will know only His wrath . The cadence . The way she 's speaking is strange . Yeah . It 's like she 's saying it by memory or something . I have received warning from the Lord . Woe unto them that calls good evil and evil good ... that puts darkness for light . They would subvert His will and stop tonight from happening . And they are here among us . Even now ! Who are you ? And why have you come here ? We 're just passing through , and we didn 't mean to interrupt your Sunday . We 're just looking for directions is all . Yeah . Sorry to interrupt your service . It 's just , we couldn 't find anybody outside , and ... well , everyone seems to be in here . We 're just sorry to disturb you all ... and we 'll just be going . Thank you . They 're lying . I know these men . They have come here to sabotage our project . Hang them up in the slaughterhouse . Run them into the street . Do anything you have to . The Lord will be with you and guide your hands . To the slaughterhouse . Thank you , old friend . You mind getting the Good Book out of my back pocket ? I want to pass the time in peace while I 'm strung up here . You 're gonna need it . Maybe you wanna tell us about that tunnel you 're so proud of . - Where is it ? - I ain 't telling you nothing . Said too damn much already . What do you intend to do with us ? Take you out and stone you till you 're dead like we do all agents of Satan . Whoa ! Hey , you can 't do that . Last time I checked we still had a document called the Constitution . The devil don 't abide by no legal mumbo-jumbo . Take it up with him . - He sent you here . - These people are in the Stone Age . These people ... are in the vanguard . Vanguard ? - Where 'd you hear that word , old man ? - That 's the word He used ... when He turned my life around . Haven 't touched a drop since . Praise Him ... and fuck you . Well , speaking of Satan , here comes Judas . Well , if it ain 't Mr Science . You 're looking swell . - Old-time religion suits you , I guess . - You shouldn 't have come here . And miss the Second Coming ? Not a chance . It was a mistake to follow me . Do you have any idea what 's happening here , Kurt ? - I know exactly what 's happening here . - Good . Just for a minute there , you had us worried . You think there 's a prosaic answer for everything , don 't you , Chuck ? That 's your weakness . I used to be just as blind . I thought everything in the universe had a mundane scientific explanation . - A logical solution . - It does , Kurt . This place is Babylon . You 're wrong . This is the Promised Land . Kurt , you 're a goddamn atheist , for Christ 's sake . Don 't you ever mention the Lord 's name in vain . Do you hear ? Kurt , you don 't believe in this . You never have . What do you know of me ? You don 't know me . - You don 't know what I believe in . - Yeah , I do . You believe in mathematics , in evolution , in science . Quiet ! I was warned about you . " And these are the days in the kingdoms where there shall be the God in heaven ... " who shall set up the kingdoms that shall never be destroyed . " That 's it . Give it to them , Doctor . Don 't let the devil in . Kurt , this machine is screwing up the weather all over Texas . - Why does God need all this hot air ? - The Lord has reasons for everything . - Who are you to question Him ? - Because this place is Babylon , Kurt . That symbol is Babylon ... one of those kingdoms you 're talking about that God destroyed ... for enslaving the Israelites , and that damn contraption is the Tower of Babel ... that was brought down by the sin of pride ! From human beings who are attempting to try to climb to God ... You have the sin of pride ! You and the agency you work for ! You tried to climb to God ! Look at the name of the hotel , Kurt . The Chaldean . - Those were the magicians of Babylon ! - Don 't listen to him , Doctor . Those were the fakers of Babylon ... who tried to interpret the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar . The dream that said iron and brass and clay and silver and gold . Have you seen that shit around here anywhere ? No ! " The magicians shall not reveal themselves to the King ! " And theirs shall be a God in heaven ... " that revealeth his secrets and make us known ! " Yeah . You 're quoting your Book of Daniel , Kurt . But you haven 't quoted it all . Listen to the rest of it . Listen to the rest of it . " And there was the iron and the brass and the clay and the gold and the silver ... " and the wind carried them to where they had found no place ! " These are the four empires that tried to defy God , Kurt ! - That 's where you are ! They defied God ! - Walk away now ! He 's a devil using the Lord 's word to twist your thinking ! That 's my Bible , Chuck . Where 'd you get it ? I got it out of your loft , Kurt . Listen to me . How dare you touch it and soil it with your hand ? Leviathan , Kurt . Remember that word ? It was the code I found on the Odyssey comsys file after we saw the Earth explode . Leviathan comes from Lotan , Kurt . The seven-headed serpent from Babylon . You know what your boy , Daniel , called Lotan ? You know what your boy , Daniel , called Leviathan ? The last beast , Kurt ! " The last beast shall devour the Earth and break it to pieces ! " He who seeketh to destroy the world ! " I will not be corrupted . " And Babylon shall not be inhabited again ! " And the stars in heaven shall not give up their light ! " And the sun shall darken and the moon shall not cause its light to shine ! " We saw that , Kurt ! It 's in your Book ! We saw it together ! " And I shall shake the heavens and I shall remove the world from its place . " And I will make men rarer than fine gold ... " except for the five ... " who may seek to save the world from fire ! " That 's us , Kurt ! - We were sent to save the world from fire ! - Stop ! Just stop ! Stop ! Should we stone them to death now , Doc ? Not yet . I want them both to live and witness the arrival . After that , I will shoot them both personally . - Ain 't no firearms in this town . - I know where there 's one . - Think you went a little overboard , Dad ? - Whatever . All that stuff about the five , saving the Earth from fire . - That stuff in the Bible ? - Hell , no . I was just adding my own horseshit . I don 't think it did a bit of damn good . " A rock was cut out , but not by human hands . " It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them . " - She 's on a computer . - She 's talking to the Lord . " The iron , the clay , bronze , silver and gold were smashed to pieces at the same time . " And became like chaff on the threshing floor in the summer . " The wind swept them away without leaving a trace . " The rock that struck the statue ... " became a huge mountain and filled the whole Earth . " You have done well . Now we will join together ... and bring others to the truth and our legions will grow . And when all the unbelievers are swept away ... we will remake the world in our image . In your image ? Move back ! - You killed Him ! - Yes . I did . I killed him . So he sure as hell ain 't the Lord . Move ! Stand back ! Move ! Move ! What 's he saying ? He killed Him ! Was that what I thought it was ? If I 'm not mistaken , it was a real , live Sentient . He wasn 't interested in creating Synthetics . He wanted to come here himself . And that passage was some kind of tunnel from cyberspace . Yeah . Well , it needed heat so I thought cold . What we needed was a good old CO2 fire-extinguisher . So what brought you to your senses ? It certainly wasn 't your dad 's horseshit about us saving the world from fire . - Don 't be so sure that was horseshit . - What was it then ? Well , this supposed Lord went to great lengths to keep us ... from the outside world , from any contact with the outside world . No families , no friends , no loved ones of any kind . The penalty was death . Human connections . You destroyed the illusion . - Did you just call me a loved one ? - Right . Loved ones . I think I went over the top with my phrasing there . Let 's get out of here . What was it , Doctor ? That thing . What have we done here ? Got sucked into a dream , Doctor . That 's all . Got sucked into a dream . My poor baby . What a wonderful change in the weather is coming , folks . Not only is it gonna be cool out , but we have got rain on the way . And to think , Sarah , you laughed at my boogie rain dance yesterday ... but it worked , didn 't it ? Can 't argue with success , Warren . Who knew that Play That Funky Music , White Boy could bring on precipitation ? It was my dancing , honey . My hips were in sync with the hand of Pataris ... the Brazilian god of clouds and wind . Rain is coming , folks , and I say let it pour . - Hey , Chad , about the new weather guy ... - I don 't wanna hear it . I changed my mind . I think he 's kind of cute . Well , you got the bag packed , and you 're ready to go . I was waiting for a taxi . When are you leaving ? I 'm not . My dad just called . They 're sending my mom home . It wasn 't her heart . It was an oesophageal condition caused by acid reflux . - I think I 'm going crazy . - Why ? 'Cause I no longer think you 're crazy . You are my husband , right ? You 're not from outer space ? I didn 't give birth to a Martian ? Well , I can 't speak for the Martian ... but I 'm from Denton , Texas , where I met you . Good night , Mom . Good night , Dad . Good night , Neil . Hey , old man . My word . What are you doing here , sweetheart ? Well , I called you , but you never called me back . Tonight 's Willis Jensen 's birthday party , isn 't it ? That 's right . Well , I haven 't seen the guy in a while , and I thought I 'd go with you . What you wanna do that for ? Bunch of old fogies sitting around exchanging gossip ... and wishing they were 10 years younger . You 'd be bored to tears . - You 're not happy to see me ? - I am . Of course , I am . Just trying to save you from an evening of tedium . Well , I 'll take my chances . Besides , it looks like you 've had a few . You shouldn 't be driving . - Well , Bryson will drive me . - You gave Bryson the night off . - How do you know that ? - I know . So it looks like I 'll be your chauffeur for the evening . Come on , Daddy . Let 's go . We don 't wanna be late . - What 's going on , Angela ? - What do you mean ? This is the road you took . What ... You are not making any sense . About five miles up at Angler 's Fork , where you 're supposed to take a left ... and go to Willis Jensen 's birthday party , you 're gonna take a right . - What on earth are you babbling about ? - Donna St James . - What about her ? - You were going to see her , Dad . You had no intention of going to Willis Jensen 's birthday party . Oh , yeah . You 're pissed , I know . I 'm not supposed to know about that for another three years , right ? But you were seeing her long before you divorced Mom . Weren 't you ? Shit . Oh , shit . It was only a cow pony . It probably jumped a fence at one of the ranches around here . So what ? What the fuck is this all about ? You have been spinning the truth for so long ... a goddamn express train could not stop a lie out of you . It was a fucking horse , Dad ! A horse . I 've been torturing myself for years ... over a fucking horse .

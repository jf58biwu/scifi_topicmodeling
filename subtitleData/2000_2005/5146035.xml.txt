 In the first years of the 21st century ... a third world war broke out . Those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive ... a fourth . That our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked . So we have created a new arm of the law ... the Grammaton Cleric , whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man 's inhumanity to man , his ability to feel . Police ! You know what to do . Get down ! Cleric . Lights out . Maybe more than a dozen inside . When the door 's down , blow the bulbs . Go . [ gunfire ] [ silence ] [ whispering ] - This is it . - Where ? There . It 's real . Burn it . Why didn 't you just leave it for the Evidentiary Team to log ? They miss things sometimes . I thought I 'd take it down myself , get it done properly . How long , Preston , until all this is gone ? Until we 've burned every last bit of it ? Resources are tight . We 'll get it all eventually . Libria , I congratulate you . At last , peace reigns in the heart of man . At last , war is but a word whose meaning fades from our understanding . At last ... we ... are ... home . Librians , there is a disease in the heart of man . Its symptom is hate . Its symptom is anger . Its symptom is rage . Its symptom is war . The disease is human emotion . But Libria , I congratulate you . For there is a cure for this disease . At the cost of the dizzying highs of human emotion , we have suppressed its abysmal lows . And you , as a society , have embraced this cure . Prozium . Now we are at peace with ourselves and humankind is one . War has gone . Hate , a memory . We are our own conscience now and it is this conscience that guides us to rate EC-10 for emotional content all those things that might tempt us to feel again and destroy them ! Librians , you have won ! Against all odds and your own natures , you have survived . [ bleeping ] Every time we come from the Nethers to the city , it reminds me of why we do what we do . It does ? I beg your pardon ? It does . The following items have been rated EC-10 Condemned . Seven works of two-dimensional illustrated material , seven discs of musical content , twenty interactive strategy computer programs . Thank you for coming , Cleric . I assume you know who I am . Yes , sir , of course . You are Vice-Council Dupont , of the Third Counciliary of the Tetragrammaton . Father 's voice . I am told that you were very nearly a prodigal student , knowing almost instantly if someone is feeling . I have a good record , sir . Why do you imagine that is , Cleric ? I 'm not sure , Vice-Council . Somehow ... I 'm able , on some level , to sense how an offender thinks , to put myself in their position . If you had ceased your interval . If you were a sense offender . I suppose you could say that , sir . - You 're a family man , Cleric ? - Yes , sir . A boy and a girl . The boy 's in the Monastery on path to becoming a cleric . Good . And the mother ? My spouse was incinerated for sense offence four years ago . - By yourself ? - No , sir . By another . How did you feel about that ? I 'm sorry , I don 't fully understand , sir . How did you feel ? I didn 't feel anything . Really ? How is it that you came to miss it ? I ... I 've asked myself that same question , sir . I don 't know . A nearly unforgivable lapse , Cleric . I trust you 'll be more vigilant in the future . Yes , sir . Every time we come from the Nethers to the city , it reminds me of why we do what we do . It does ? Every time we come from the Nethers to the city , it reminds me of why we do what we do . It does ? It does . Prosecutorial evidence for AR 136890 . I need it . It was late this afternoon . May not have showed up in the records yet . Nothing logged and nothing pending under that entry . It was an item brought in by Grammaton Erroll Partridge . Check again . Cleric Partridge has not entered anything in for weeks . You 're mistaken . It was a book of some kind . Cleric . There 's nothing . Thank you . He 's been into the Nether every night for two weeks . We assumed it was enforcement-related . You always knew . " But I , being poor , have only my dreams . " " I 've spread my dreams under your feet . " " Tread softly , because you tread on my dreams . " I assume you dream , Preston . I 'll do what I can to see they go easy on you . We both know they never go easy . - Then I 'm sorry . - No , you 're not . You don 't even know the meaning . It 's just a vestigial word for a feeling you 've never felt . Don 't you see , Preston ? It 's gone . Everything that makes us what we are , traded away . There 's no war . No murder . - What is it you think we do ? - No . You 've been with me . You 've seen how it can be , the jealousy , the rage . A heavy cost . I pay it gladly . Don 't . You and your partner were close ? I hope you 're as pleased to be assigned me as I am the placement . I was told this would be a career-making advancement . I 'm like you , Cleric . Intuitive . Sometimes I know what a person 's feeling before they know it . Cleric . I could only hope one day to be as ... uncompromising as you . Good night . The later 20th century saw the fortuitous and simultaneous rise of two synergistic political and psychological sciences . The first , the revolutionary precept of the hate crime . - John . - Yes . I saw Bobbie Taylor crying today . He didn 't know , but I saw . Do you think I should report him ? Unquestionably . .. the single inescapable fact that mankind united with infinitely greater purpose in pursuit of war than he ever did in pursuit of peace . [ Partridge ] " But I , being poor , have only my dreams . " " I 've spread my dreams under your feet . " " Tread softly , because you tread on my dreams . " Viviana Preston , don 't move ! Don 't move ! Comply ! Comply ! - Stop where you are ! - Get down ! Get down ! Don 't shoot . This is a lawful entry . We have a warrant for your wife 's arrest for sense offence . Hey ! Get her ! Get her off him now ! Remember me . Awaken to triumph again in the face of yet another day . Another step ... [ son ] What are you doing ? I said , what are you doing ? I accidentally dropped my morning interval . I took it out before I brushed my teeth . I never take it out before I brush my teeth . Then you 'll go by Equilibrium , log the loss and get a replacement . Yes . Of course . Your new partner called . He 'll pick you up at ten for the AR . I hope you don 't mind . I took the liberty of telling him you would be at Equilibrium replacing your dose . No , of course not . That was the right thing to do . [ girl stirs food ] Stop that . Due to terrorist activity , this site is temporarily closed . Proceed to the Equilibrium Centre in Sector 8-A . Due to terrorist activity , this site is temporarily closed ... [ hooting ] More than punctual , Cleric . Hop in . How are the lines ? I 'm surprised you could get your interval and get out so quickly . No , they 're fine today . Maybe I 'll drop by later and get my interval adjusted . You expecting resistance ? That 's something you 'll find about me . I 'm a wary person . Cautious by nature . Always expecting the worst . - You cannot do this . - Tetragrammaton . There 's nothing we can 't do . How long have you been off the dose ? Look at you . Look at you ! Look at you . The mirror 's frame 's illegal . Destroy it . You 're gonna burn it , aren 't you ? Eventually . However , you couldn 't have accumulated this by yourself . It 'll all be sorted and examined . We 'll discover who your confederates are . We need her . - What 's your name ? - O 'Brien . Mary . Well , Mary , you can either wait and tell the Technicians of the Palace of Justice or you can tell me now . Who are your friends ? I 'm wondering if you have any idea at all what that word means - friend . There 's nothing you don 't feel ? How about guilt ? Let me ask you something . Why are you alive ? I 'm alive ... I live ... to safeguard the continuity of this great society , to serve Libria . It 's circular . You exist to continue your existence . What 's the point ? What 's the point of your existence ? To feel . Because you 've never done it , you can never know it . But it 's as vital as breath . And without it , without love , without anger , without sorrow , breath is just a clock ... ticking . Then I have no choice but to remand you to the Palace of Justice for processing . Processing . You mean execution , don 't you ? Processing . The gun katas . Through analysis of recorded gunfights , the Cleric has determined that the distribution of antagonists in any gun battle is a statistically predictable element . The gun kata treats the gun as a total weapon , each new position representing a maximum kill zone , inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents , while keeping the defender clear of statistically traditional trajectories of return fire . By the rote mastery of this art , your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120 % . The difference of a 63 % increased lethal proficiency makes the master of the gun katas an adversary not to be taken lightly . [ Mary ] Without love , breath is just a clock ... ticking . [ rapid heartbeat ] Prozium - the great nepenthe . Opiate of our masses , glue of our great society . Salve and salvation , it has delivered us from pathos , from sorrow , the deepest chasms of melancholy and hate . With it we anaesthetise grief , annihilate jealousy , obliterate rage . Those sister impulses toward joy , love and elation are anaesthetised in stride , except as fair sacrifice . For we embrace Prozium in its unifying fullness and all that it has done to make us great . - Good morning , Cleric . - Good morning . .. intrinsically humans as creatures of the earth were drawn inherently always back to one thing : war . And thus we seek to correct not the symptom , but the disease itself . We have sought to shrug off individuality , replacing it with conformity . Replacing it with sameness , with unity , allowing each man , woman and child in this great society to lead identical lives . The concept of identical viable construction allows each of us to head confidently Into each moment ... What are you doing ? I 'm rearranging my desk . You didn 't like the way it was before ? I had no feelings about it . I 'm merely attempting to optimise . Sense offenders holed up in the Nether . We estimate 50 men , sir . Intelligence tells us they 're all fully armed . This is the group that bombed the Prozium factories . - You clean , we 'll sweep . - Yes , sir . Go , go , go , go ! Go ! Cover me . I 'm going in . Nice grab , Cleric . Ludwig van Beethoven . [ Beethoven symphony starts ] Cleric , why didn 't you leave that for the Evidentiary Team to collect and log ? They miss things sometimes . I 'm gonna take it in myself , make sure it gets done properly . You know , Preston , if we keep burning all this contraband , eventually there won 't be anything left to burn . What 'll there be for men like us ? Sir ! We got something out back . They were defended by women and children . We put them down . This isn 't the first time we 've seen this . Why do they keep these animals ? Do they ... Do they eat ' em ? - What do you want me to do ? - Exterminate them , of course . - All right , let 's do it . - No . What 's wrong , Cleric ? Nothing . Hey ! Grab it . Grab it ! Sir , toss it back in . I 'll finish it off . - Give it to me , sir . - Give it to him . He 'll finish it . [ dog whines ] Wait ! It seems to me that ... at least some of these animals ought to be tested for disease . If there 's an epidemic in the Nethers , it 's best we know . I don 't quite follow your logic , Cleric . They were Resistance . They could have led us to the Underground . But instead of interrogation , they were slaughtered . But given the circumstances , the Father has decreed that there will be no more process for sense offenders . They are to be shot on sight or incinerated without trial . It 's counter to law . You 're a member of the Council ... It is not the will of the Council . It is the will of Father and he is law . Sir ... without the logic of process , is it not just mayhem ? What we have worked so hard to eradicate ? You must understand , Preston , that while you and even I may not always agree with it , it is not the message that is important . It is our obedience to it . Father 's will . Call it faith . You have it , I assume . Yes . I have it . Good . Confiscated evidence X-23-T-45 . Mary O 'Brien . Cleric John Preston passing into the Nether . Enforcement-related . Thank you , sir . I don 't know what else to do with you . Go on . Go on . Go ! [ dog yelps ] [ barks ] Fine . But you 're going back in the trunk . OK . Here . Step away from the vehicle . Step away from the vehicle . This is your last warning . Step away from the vehicle . Identification . Cleric . I 'm here on official ... - Identification ! - It 's in my coat . - Where 's the coat ? Where is it ? - I don 't have it . Unidentified individuals are subject to destruction . You 're making a mistake . I 'm a Grammaton Cleric First Class . - We 'll search your vehicle . - There 's nothing in it . Search it . - Clear , sir . - Keys to the trunk . I 'm trying to tell you I have a predawn combustion to witness ... This is a waste of my time . My name is John Preston . I 'm the highest-ranking cleric ... Wait ! Stand off . I 'm sorry . I didn 't recognise you , sir . That 's OK . Just doing your job . Thank you . We 'll escort you back to the gate . - Thanks . - [ dog yelps ] Animals . The Nether 's full of ' em . Sounds like it came from your trunk . Impossible . Just give me my keys . I 'll be on my way . Captain , I 'm asking you one last time . Don 't do this . - Down on your knees ! - Down on your knees ! Shoot him ! Fuck ! What ? Shit ! Shoot him , shoot him , shoot him ! [ grunts ] Always practising , Cleric . I guess that 's why you 're the best . Maybe I 'm just better . Something on your mind ? - Why do you ask ? - The intuitive arts . It 's my job to know what you 're thinking . So , then , what am I thinking ? About the murders in the Nether last night . And if they know who did it . Am I close ? So tell me , do they know ? There are theories . I have one of two of my own , but at the moment they 're premature . I 'm glad it happened . - Why ? - Now Father and the Council have to create an acceleration in the crackdown on offenders . Whoever did it , all they accomplished was a quicker end to the Resistance . It 's gonna be a massacre , Cleric . I came to tell you there 's a raid in the Nether . Sector 7 . So get ready . That door behind you . Go . Go , damn you ! Get out of here . If you don 't , you 're dead . - He 'll shoot us in the back . - I 'd shoot you in the face . Go . Damn you ! Follow me . Now ! Let 's go . Prisoners and apprehendees are to be put down . Look out ! What 's happening ? We heard gunshots . - Go ! - What are you doing ? They 're Resistance fighters . Cleric ! He 's a sense offender ! [ shouting ] What is this ? - What are you doing ? - Nicely done , Cleric . You drive them into the trap . I close it . The very definition of teamwork . Don 't you think ? Why don 't you take the honours of the execution , Cleric ? These people should be taken for clinical interrogation . Father 's rulings are quite clear . Offenders are to be shot on sight . They have valuable information . They can be put to better use ... Cleric . If your weapon 's low , please use mine . No . I think , in the end , it 'll be better if you have it . - Captain . - Yes , sir . Firing positions ! Ready ! Aim ! Fire ! - Sir . - Yes , Cleric . You asked me to be an instrument against the Resistance . I 'm ready . Today . I wish to show my faith . I wish with your permission to locate the Underground once and for all . To destroy it . - To destroy it . - Good . Do it . I 'm so ... so very sorry . These are the possessions he had on him at the time of death . The legal ones will be burned with him . Good . Erroll Partridge . It 's supposed to mean something ? He was a Grammaton Cleric First Class . You knew him . News bulletin . I 'm a sense offender . I don 't hang round much with the Cleric . I wanna know about him . Well , I suggest you go ask him , but I understand that he 's dead . Killed by your friends at the Tetragrammaton . Not by my friends . By me . You were lovers . And thus it is in the writing of the Father that we find our greatest ... Good afternoon , sir . What will it be for you ? The latest copy of The Insensate ? Revised edition of the Manifesto ? Erroll Partridge . What do you know about him ? - I beg your pardon ? - Everyone out now . I 'm gonna ask you one more time . Erroll Partridge . What do you know about him ? I 'm sure this must be some mistake . - You 're an offender . - I 'm not . No ? Then why are you so scared of me ? You will tell me everything you know about Erroll Partridge , or I will have you taken to the Hall of Destruction for summary combustion . - I really don 't know ... - Speak ! He 'd come in here with a fella named Jurgen . - Why ? - That 's all I know , I swear . Interesting . We 've been watching you , Preston . You 're Jurgen . You 're feeling . Do you know why you came ? Welcome to the Underground . Polygraph . It detects fluctuations of human emotion . We have to be sure . Mary . You 're carrying in your pocket a ribbon sprayed with her scent . You breathe it in sometimes when you think there 's no one to see . But what you feel ... could only be satisfied by folding yourself into her . She 's scheduled for combustion . Tomorrow . I know . You know , I was like you . But the first thing you learn about emotion is that it has its price . A complete paradox . But without restraint , without control , emotion is chaos . - How is that ... - The difference is that when we want to feel , we can . It 's just that ... some of us ... have to forego that luxury so that the rest can have it . Some very few of us have to force ourselves not to feel . Like me . Like you . What can I do ? You can kill Father . [ truck horn beeps ] Cleric John Preston , you are to come with us immediately . - Cleric Preston . - Sir . I 've heard the most disturbing rumour . - Rumour , sir ? - Yes . A rumour maintaining that one of us , one of the Cleric , has secretly taken it upon himself to cease his dose . That one of our elite number is actually feeling . Feeling , sir ? Are you playing with me , Cleric ? [ guns cock ] No , sir . This person , I 'm told , is actually attempting to contact the Resistance . Now , tell me , if you would be so kind , how exactly have you been making use of your time of late ? Attempting to contact the Resistance , sir . Attempting ? How is it that you intend to expose this traitor if all you do is attempt ? You 're absolutely 100 % right , sir . Of course I am . The Cleric is the final line of defence . If the Resistance compromises it , we are doomed . Father is doomed . I will redouble my effort , sir , to locate the Resistance , to find this traitor and bring them all to the Council 's fair justice . Do it . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? I , uh ... I was checking to make sure you 've been ... taking your interval . And are you satisfied ? Yes , I am . Good night , then . I don 't understand . My execution 's set . Why are you here ? [ bleeping ] Aren 't you going to dose ? My God . What ... What 'II you do ? I don 't know . - Fifty sweepers , maybe more . - What about an audience ? Father 's never given a single audience since the upheaval . They 've trained you to fight these kind of odds . Even if I could ... Even if I could make it through , what guarantee is there it would accomplish anything , anything would be different ? Our network is larger than you could imagine . The instant word comes that Father is dead , bombs will be set off at the Prozium clinics and factories . If we can succeed in disrupting the supply for even one day , one day , our cause will be won by human nature itself . What about war ? There would be cruelties that are gone . Replaced by the Tetragrammaton ? Will you do it ? Yes . Can you ? I don 't know . Don 't ... Seeing her one last time will only make it harder to do what you have to do . File footage . Viviana Preston . Sentence and incineration . - Auditory . - Viviana Preston , for ceasing your interval , for the crime of feeling , you will suffer annihilation in the city furnaces . You will be taken there immediately and you will burn . Has the incineration gone through ? It 's going through now . Hey ! Machine turbines priming . Machine turbines priming . - I need to speak to this woman . - You 're too late . If we force the door now , the turbines will explode at street level . .. clear the area Immediately . All unauthorised personnel , clear the area Immediately . Turbines primed . Fire in ten seconds , nine seconds , eight seconds , seven seconds , six seconds , five seconds , four seconds , three seconds , two seconds ... Turbines ... fire . Cleric John Preston . You are under arrest . This man , this senior cleric , has ceased the dose . He is feeling . He is the worm that has been eating at the core of our great society . And I ... I have brought him for your justice . I told you I 'd make my career with you , Preston . Vice-Council , this man is guilty of consorting with sense offenders , of having relations with a female , of sense crime itself . Dispatch a team to his quarters to search for unused Prozium . If you 'll run the trace record on his sidearm , you will find it was he who was with the sweeper team when they were murdered . Cleric , I assume you have something to say to me . I know ... it 's hard to believe ... that a cleric of the Tetragrammaton could turn his back on everything he 's been taught , become associated with the Resistance , even becoming a champion in its Underground . But it 's true . I promised I would bring you that man . And I have . - Cleric Brandt . - Sir . The trace shows that it was your gun in the Nether with the sweepers . That 's impossible . This is wrong . I think , in the end , it 'll be better if you have it . He switched them . See , I have his gun now . Of course you do . You took it when you arrested me . What ? Take him to the Hall of Destruction for combustion . Wait , wait , wait , wait ! I can explain this . I 'm not feeling . He is the one who 's feeling . This is a mistake . Of course , since a complaint has been lodged , law and the letter is that I allow a team to carry out the search of your premises . Do you think that 's entirely necessary or am I being too ... exacting ? As you say , sir , it 's the law and the letter . And it doesn 't disturb you in the least that your colleague is going to his end ? The only thing that disturbs me , sir , is that I am Father 's instrument against the Underground , and yet ... I 've never had the honour of meeting him . You know that Father never grants an audience to anyone . Even to the man who brings him the Resistance ? Just a formality . The search team will be up momentarily . Excellent . I have nothing to hide . The search team 's already inside , sir . Excellent . [ son ] Looking for something ? If I were you , I 'd be more careful ... in the future . - How long ? - Since Mom . - And Lisa ? - Of course . - How did you know ? - You forget . It 's my job to know what you 're thinking . Then you know what I 'm gonna do now . You have a message for the Vice-Council ? It 's done . I 've located the Resistance . Come now . You 'll have them all . Do not address Father unless first addressed by him . Avoid eye contact . If you should break his personal security zone , you will be immediately put down by snipers . Is that understood ? You 'll be required to surrender your firearm , of course . - And then there 's the test . - Test ? Yes . You didn 't imagine we would risk exposing Father to even such a dedicated servant as yourself without first having him tested , did you ? Please . Cleric , your weapon , please . Here . Sit . We 'll start with a test question first . More of a riddle , actually . What would you say is the easiest way to get a weapon away from a Grammaton Cleric ? You ask him for it . I told you I 'd make my career with you , Cleric . Preston . Brandt 's job was simple . To make you feel like you 'd won , to make you feel safe . For years , I tried to infiltrate an agent into the Underground , until it hit me . In order to pass undetected Into their midst , in order to be trusted by them , my provocateur would have to think like them , and would have to feel like them . But where to find such a man ? A man with the capacity to feel who didn 't yet know it . But ... we 've never met . No ? Don 't look so surprised . Why should Father be more real than any other political puppet ? The real Father died years ago . The Council elected me to pursue his paternal tradition . And you , Preston , the supposed saviour of the Resistance , are now its destroyer . And along with them you 've given me yourself . Calmly . Coolly . Entirely without incident . No . - [ long bleep ] - Oh . Shit . Not without incident . I 'm coming . You really should learn to knock . How did it feel , Preston ? [ growls ] Mind the uniform , Cleric . I plan to be wearing it for a long time . Be careful , Preston . You 're treading on my dreams . No ! Wait ! Wait ! Look at me . Look at me . I 'm life . I live , I breathe . I feel . Now that you know it , can you really take it ? Is it really worth the price ? I pay it gladly .

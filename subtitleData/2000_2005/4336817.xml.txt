 Futurama [ 3x11 ] - The Cyber House Rules - CiWaN I gave the cookies you made to the kids . They couldn ' t believe it . They were delicious . But , I digress . Tremble , puny earthlings ! One day my race will destroy you all ! Can one of you guys get that ? It 's a doorbell baby ! Hello , little guy . I was abandoned as a baby too . So ... Garbage , huh ? I 'll take care of it . Bender , stop ! It 's a baby ! A baby what ? Ow . It 's just a card from the orphanarium I grew up in . Leela , you 're invited to a reunion ... At Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium ! Please stand clear of self-Destructing basket . A reunion at your old orphanarium ? You gonna go ? No way , Jose-Bot . I never want to see those orphans again . Not after the way they used to pick on me . One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! Nice depth perception , One-Eye . How can you make fun of me ? You 're blind . My eyes may not work , but at least I got two of them . That 's terrible , Leela . Imagine the look on their faces when we eat all the hors d 'oeuvres . Well , I wouldn 't mind rubbing my success in a few faces . Set a course for adventure ! Ew . What a dump ! Just like old times . Gosh , the bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then . Ahem . Mr. Vogel , remember me ? Leela , you 're worthless , and no one will ever love you ! You used to say that all the time . Oh , those were happier days . Mm . The gristle in a blanket isn 't half bad . Try the Popsicle sticks . They 've absorbed a lot of flavor . Hey , look , it 's our old group picture . I don 't see you anywhere . That 's me over in Cootietown . Get a load of this average-Looking guy . That 's Adlai Atkins . I used to have kind of a crush on him . One-Eye ! One-Eye ! Stupid as a French guy ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! One-Eye ! Well , it 's time to say hello to the old gang . So , what you been up to since you left ? Living in a box . You ? Selling kidneys , teeth , whatever . And what am I up to , you ask ? Why , I 'm a very successful space captain . Oh . Wow . How nice for you , Leela . That 's so good for a person with one eye . Hey , you can 't feel sorry for me . I 'm a space captain , and you 're a bunch of losers . Right , right . We 're the losers . Well , if it isn 't old One-Eye . Oh , yeah ? Well , shut up , cane-Boy ! He can 't hear you . He 's deaf now . Leave her alone . She 's leading a normal life . She 's not gussied up , duded out or where it 's at . Now , run along . Thanks , Adlai . I guess you never outgrow being an eyeball . Oddball . Nonsense . You 're a captain . That 's a fine profession . Well , it 's just for a package delivery service . A package is just a box until it 's delivered . Huh , I 'd never thought of it that way . What do you do ? I 'm a doctor . A tall doctor , you say ? Sir , you seem stable . Have you thought about adopting ? No . It 's a great way to have a kid without sex . Really ? The government will help with $ 100 a week . A hundred dollars a week ? I 'm so sorry I teased you . Let me make it up . I 'll fix it so no one teases you . By beating them up ? I broke that blind kid 's nose , and it made no difference . No , I specialize in phaser eye surgery . I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on . It won 't be able to see , but you 'll look like a normal two-Eyed person . Me ? Perfectly normal ? Hm . Mm . Yay ! Sons , daughters , meet Uncle Fry . Why are they with you ? Do you have candy ? No . It 's called parenting . Come on , dumplings , we 've got 12 government stipends to collect . Yay ! Our daddy 's a giant toy ! Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea . I 'm sure Leela 's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time . Ah ... Cosmetic surgery 's great . I used to be too cute ... So I had cuteness reduction surgery here and here . You 're crazy ! Leela doesn 't need surgery . You look great now . Oh , that 's so sweet , Fry . But for once , I just want to look normal . You 're better , you 're abnormal ! You shouldn 't care what people think . I 'll start by not caring what you think . I 'm getting the surgery . Thattagirl ! Wonderful ! You can also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies . That 's the stupidest idea I 've ever heard , you imbecile ! Now we 'll find out if the operation was a success . Hold on to your hats . Oh , I 'm sorry . This is the wrong patient . Oops . Those eyes look so great on you ! She looked fine before . No . Wrong . Wow , look at me ! I don 't have the hang of blinking . You will . I try not to blink too much , because it 's flashy . But when I do , I enjoy it . I did it ! I blunk ! Just in time to screw up this picture ! Hooray ! Ow . Ow . I 've never felt so unremarkable ! Today I actually blended in with a crowd ! Kids , meet the jerk-Bags I work with . Hello , jerk-Bags ! They 're so cute ! What are their names ? Kids have names ? My name 's Nina , and his name 's Albert . Now you 're all named Bender Jr . ! Look ! My first government stipend check . Twelve baby humans , 1200 wing-Wangs . Daddy Bender , we 're hungry . What is it with you kids ? Every other day , it 's food , food , food ! Oh , fine . I 'll get you some stupid food . Can we have Bender burgers ? The cat shelter 's onto me . Hello , Leela . I was getting one of my shirts toned down , so I dropped in for your exam . That 's handsome of you . Follow the light with your eyes . Perfect . A guy could fall head over heels for you . I 'm interested myself . What are you saying ? I 'm not good with words , so I 'm in a delicate conundrum . Will you go out with me ? Sure . I don 't know what else to say , so I 'll just say it . Okey-Dokey , see you then . This is so unfair . I liked you as a cyclops . He 's only interested in your eyes . You 're just jealous . No , I 'm not ! Wait , I am ! But my point remains valid ! I want to try dating a man , who if you go somewhere with him ... No one says he 's crummy . I deserve that once in life . Be careful with that Adlai . He 's a doctor . They 're poor . Most doctors are rich . When did this happen ? You 're joking , right ? That 's not funny ! They got everything you need : Booze , peanuts , they got a crapper in the back ... That 's something you do , right ? Yeah . Then knock yourself out . Only eat and drink enough to keep yourselves alive ! I 'm trying to make a profit here . Daddy , Bethany 's hitting me ! Here . These kids yours ? Yeah . I like a man with responsibility . That 's me , baby . Let me ditch the kids in an alley , and we can go have some fun . Daddy Bender ? Daddy 's trying to score ... With a cheap floozy right now , so cram a Tinkertoy in it . I love you , Daddy Bender . What the hell ? Quit hugging me ! I guess you 're busy . Catch you later . You morons ! I 've got half a mind ... To hug each and every one of you , and see how you like it ! Yay ! Come on . I 'll take you someplace no one could object to . That sounds wonderful . I 'd like an extra-Beautiful bouquet for my extra-Gorgeous sweetheart . Average , please . Adlai , I 've had a wonderful time today . No one 's stared at me or avoided staring or tried to burn me . You make me feel so not weird . Leela , you 're 999,999 in a million . Thanks for coming to get to know Adlai . Isn 't he dreamy ? Totally . Listen , I want you all to know your Leela 's one standard lady . Oh , Adlai , stop . What 's wonderful about Leela being normal ? We aren 't . That 's what makes us great . Like Dr. Zoidberg . He 's a weird monster who eats garbage . Damn right . And the professor 's a senile , amoral crackpot ! Oh , ee-Yay . Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant . Tally me banana . Amy 's a klutz from Mars . Oops . And you 've got that brain thing . I already did ! Leela , do you want to be like us or like Adlai ... With no severe mental or social problems whatsoever ? That 's the dumbest question ever . She 's right . Daylight come . Coming through . Watch your head . Help , I 'm under attack ! Remember your manners . Forks in the left pocket , spoons in the right . Which one of you cutie muffins gets the spicy squab ? Me . What do we say when you get something ? About time ! That 's my boy ! And here 's your check . Bam ! I gotta go poopy ! You should 've gone before it was time to run . Go ! Through the kitchen ! You little crooks ! If I catch you , I 'm gonna make cutie-Muffin gumbo ! Seeing that robot force children to do his bidding ... Makes me think about kids . Us ? Me ? You ? Kids ? It 's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca and have kids . Oh , Adlai . This is the most beautiful moment of my life . Daddy , I want a piggyback ride ! Daddy 's tired . Let 's just have another dog pile on Fry . Tell us a story , Daddy Bender ! Story ! All right , fine . Gather around . Yeah ! Story ! We want to hear this one again . Ahem . Bender 's Arrest Record , by the police . On March 3 , at 2 p.m. , Bender was caught shoplifting . Yeah , show us the picture . There he is ! It 's 9 : 00 , you know what that means . Daddy 's sick of looking at you , so go to bed . Aw . The grownups have to talk . Come on , Ma . Now to figure out how much money I 'm raking in off those kids . I need a calculator . You are one . I mean a good calculator . Minus the food , the bunny-Rabbit wallpaper ... I get 100 bucks a kid , and they 're costing 110 ! There goes my cabinets . I won 't go to another PTA meeting ! The kids have got to go ! Daddy , how do I flush you ? Just go to bed ! Doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory ... Makes me want children even more . I was thinking . Since we 're orphans , maybe we should adopt a child . Adoption ? Yes , that 's acceptable . It 's more than acceptable . It 's adequately satisfactory . Imperial Dragon restaurant ? I 've got a herd of you-Know-Whats for sale . Let me check . Oh , aren 't you a cutie . About 35 pounds . What ? Bender , we 'd like to adopt a child . This is the place Because Bender 's Orphanarium means discount orphans . What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans ? I 'm afraid we only want one . I 'll show you what I got in stock . I remember this . They trot you out , and parents judge you like a piece of meat . I 'm Albert . Kind of fatty . Then how about this little number ? Purebred human . No vampire in there . Uh , um ... Um , uh ... If you 're strapped for cash , consider this unit . Cursed with a third ear but full of an emotion I understand is called love . One time , I did 100 jump ropes . Oh , I can 't decide . We have to think about it . Grownups gotta talk now . Time for bed . But it 's 10 a.m. I said hit the hay ! Okay , okay . Oh , they 're all so adorable . Yeah . It 's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go . Good night , you princes of Maine , you kings of New New England . You 're under arrest for child cruelty , endangerment ... Selling children as food and faking the weight of livestock . If you had kids of your own , you 'd understand ! Would it be all right if we adopted a kid ? Might as well . They 're gonna rot in the evidence locker . Nice ear ! Hey , freaky ears ! I 've made up my mind . Let 's adopt her . But there 's plenty of normal ones . Come on , she could really use a mom and dad . Ear-Face , Ear-Face Sally won the ugly race ... They have a point . She has an ear on her face . So what ? She may be different , but she still deserves a good home . If you want her , I 'll give her an operation to make her acceptable . She doesn 't need an operation . She 's fine this way . And you were fine the way you were ? Damn right I was ! Yay ! Shut up , Fry ! Look , Adlai , I 'm proud to be different . I wish I 'd realized that when I was her age . I also have a tail . Take me to the hospital and put my eye back . Now . Why should I do that ? By the end of the day , one of us is gonna have one eye . In recognition of Bender 's generous gift of 12 orphans ... And a check for 1200 wing-Wangs ... I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium ! It 's good to have the weird-Looking Leela back . You 're a true friend . I guess there 's nothing wrong with being weird . Leela , there 's nothing wrong with anything . We 'll miss you . We know robots don 't have emotions , but we drawed you this picture . So if you ever miss us , even just a teeny bit , you can look at it . Hey , I smoke a cigar , not a candy cane . Aw ... Yay ! Hey , what the ... ? Get away ! Come on ! I just got all the gum off of there ! I hate you ! I hate you all !

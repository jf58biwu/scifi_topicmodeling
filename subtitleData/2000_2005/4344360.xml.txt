 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . You have one instant message . " Kit-10 . " What do you think I 'm doing ? Oh , yeah ? Gotta love the high school girls . Flaky high school girls . No , sweetheart . Your real name . Don 't you know me ? You do know me . Great . Flaky , well-proportioned high-school girls . Hello . Hell , yeah . Come on with this chatterbox routine . It 's too fucking late . - Hello . - Hi , Neil . - Hello ? - Why 'd you sign off ? - Don 't you know who this is ? - Is this Kitten ? - Why didn 't you say goodbye ? - I tried to . - You don 't like my picture ? - No , no , no . Of course I did . - I said I 'd send the rest . - Yeah . - Hey , how 'd you get my number ? - I told you . I know all about you . - What are you doing ? - Going to sleep . - In bed ? - Yeah . Listen , can we talk about this tomorrow ? What 's wrong with tonight ? What are you wearing ? A T-shirt . Is it tight ? Kind of . - Anything else ? - Yeah . - What ? - Boxers . Anything on them ? Hearts . They were a gift . - They sound nice . - Yeah ... Listen , I really have to go to bed , so I 'll IM you tomorrow . Okay ? Bye . Hey , Kitten . Neil , I don 't wanna go to bed alone . Keep me company . No , no . Listen , my parents are gonna kill me if this phone rings again . All right ? I promise . I 'll IM tomorrow . Okay ? You promise ? Hope to die , stick a needle in your eye ? Yeah , yeah , all that stuff . Totally . All right ? - Okay . - Okay . Bye-bye . What 're you doing in here , running a phone sex ring ? I mean , who in the hell are you talking to at 3 : 47 in the morning ? Holly ? No . I wish . Things are still pretty awkward between us . You don 't think she 's remembering anything from that drug experience , do you ? No . I don 't think so . - Then who were you talking to ? - No one . Nothing . It 's just some girl I met in a chat room . A chat room . You better watch out who 's on the other side of that connection . Might be a 300-pound she-male . Don 't worry , she sent a picture . A picture ? Really ? Go to bed . Who buys your underwear ? Day 17 on the ISS . Good to be back in orbit again . The Earth looks beautiful from up here . And I 'm reminded how lucky I am to live in this time of great exploration ... and scientific advancements . The Russian shuttle will be here tomorrow with new supplies . So it 'll be a long day of unpacking and taking inventory . We will be finishing off , however , with our first fresh meal . Tatianna Korviskova , our cosmonaut mission specialist ... will be checking in and giving you updates on the docking . This is Angela Perry , ISS pilot , signing off . Very nice . All the little boys on the Internet will love you . Oh , yeah . Well , you 're up tomorrow . See how you put a new spin on the whole beauty of the Earth from orbit . I 'll just speak fast and use a lot of technical jargon . What about you , Walsh ? What are you going to say to our pre-pubescent fans ? That it 's an important job and I worked my whole life to earn my spot up here ... and I 'm damn proud of it . Tatianna , do you have the execute log for today ? I already took care of it . We 're set for docking tomorrow . Well , double-check . Angela , why don 't you update the docking log ? She just did it . No , no . That 's okay . I 'll double-check it . You two have a problem I should know about ? Other than she has no business being in space ? She almost killed her last crew . Anyone else would 've been banned for life . NASA reinstated her . Yeah , only because her father pulled enough strings . I know a hundred guys who never got a shot ... and she 's had more chances than any one person deserves . - She 's a good pilot . - She 's also a liability . - You know you 're not supposed to be here . - Mary . - It 's been four days . I gotta see my kid . - He 's not safe with you , Sarah . You know me . You know what kind of mother I am and you know that 's not true . - Well , Paul is my son . - Corey 's mine . Hey , Corey , come here , baby . - Hi . - Hi , Mama . Hey , little man . What ? Corey ? What ? What 's wrong ? Daddy said you 're sick in the head . He said you tried to hurt me . I would never try and hurt you , honey . It 's sort of like a service station or remote server ... that allows us to house the entire school 's computer needs here . We have Kelsey and Bodanis to thank for turning several donated ... Junked , ancient , completely outdated CPU 's into our very own state-of-the-art remote server . - Mrs Hess ? - Yes . We 'd like to request that the server be hereafter known by its proper name ... the Twinternet . All right . The Twinternet has the power of a mainframe . And if we can lower the temperature of the CPU enough ... we can increase the processor speed by a factor of three . Anyone know why ? Anyone else ? Computers speed up when they cool down . Thank you , Bodanis . The Twinternet is like an island . Information comes in over the transom , we stop it , we analyse it ... and then we release it . We can filter out objectionable material . So what kinds of things would we filter out ? Any ideas ? Like racist , you know , neo-Nazi kind of sites ? Correct . What else ? - Porn . Unfortunately . - Yes . Unless you have a key to the back door . Check this out . Come on , you guys . What else ? " How to Make a Bomb " sites and stuff like that . - Exactly . Violent or dangerous websites . - Oh , no . Do the architects of our system have anything to add ? Well , before we let the kids loose on the Twinternet ... maybe we should test the firewalls . You know , in case anything inappropriate gets through ... it can be caught by the proper authorities , like yourself . Okay . For the first time in Fuller Austin High School history ... this class will now search on the Internet for pornography . I don 't have your number , ding-a-ling . Why am I lying ? - How do you know that ? - She 's stalking you , dude . Man , this chick types fast . Who is this chick , man ? Shut up , man . No , she 's just some freak . Hey , check this out . - Hello ? - Do not blow me off . I didn 't . I just ... Look , I can 't talk right now . - Hey , Holly . - Hey . - Hey , Red . - Hey . I was wondering if I might get out of the doghouse ... in time to treat you to a movie . - I 've got a lot of homework . - I 'll have you home by dinner . Come on . Popcorn , Goobers , whatever your heart desires . - Okay . - All right . Meet you after school . - So , where 're you headed ? - French . - That 's not French . - But it has an accent . - Look , are you going this way ? - But of course . Stupid Americans , no ? Please . Miss . Mrs Forbes , please . - I need to talk to you . - Just give us a minute , okay ? Are you crazy bringing this here ? How could you tell our son that I would hurt him ? You saw Corey in violation of a judge 's order ? - Yeah . I did . - Okay , I want you out of here . No . Why are you doing this ? Tell me why you 're doing this . - Telling them I 'm sick . - Don 't make me call Security . - Paul , I am your wife ! - Do not make me do that . Why are you ... Don 't you turn your back on me ! Get Security up here . You need help , okay ? I do not know if it 's your fault or not ... but you are not going anywhere near our son . I am trying to save our son 's life . - Mr Forbes . - Could you please escort the lady out ? Ma 'am , why don 't you come with us ? You know , someday you 're really gonna hate yourself for that . Dude , she was smoking . Yeah . I don 't know that I 've ever met her . Well , but she 's watching you . It 's like some kind of a reverse stalker . Unless she 's ugly , then she 's just a stalker . Well , you 've seen the photo . Yeah . From the neck down . She 's hiding something . Like what ? Her identity ? All right . Look , the point is , can you trace her calls or not ? I hacked into my cell phone account and this is all I got . - She 's persistent . - Yes . Can you do it ? - Of course we can . - Okay . Thank you . Holly , hold up . - Kitten sent this to me . - What ? - Is this her ? - No , no , no . Wait . Holly , I ... Damn it . Holly ! Holly , come on . Don 't make me chase you all over the city . Come on , I promise it 's not what you think . I can explain . She said she was your new girlfriend . Your new girlfriend . Does that make me your old girlfriend ? No . I 've never even ... I barely know this girl . She is a fucking nut . Well , she certainly knows a lot about your underwear ... your heart boxers , the ones I gave you for Christmas . I wore them in the locker room . The guys were teasing me about it . She probably heard about it . That 's it . Come on , I would never do that to you . You are the most beautiful girl in Houston ... In Texas , in the world . You 've got to believe me . I 'm eating irradiated beef and watching the walls buckle . Now , now , now , sugar , don 't mock international cooperation . That 's the best menu 16 countries could come up with . Makes me miss Siegfried and Roy . Siegfried and Roy ? - We 're using code words , Chuckie . - There 's the menu . I 'm the Middle East ? - Who came up with this shit ? - I did . Ancient and full of unresolved conflict . Just spoke to me . - And who the hell does that make you ? - Trojan . - You ain 't as young as you think , pal . - No smoking . You 're forbidden . - Shit . - Well , just ask her about Walsh . All right . How is rehydrated ice cream ? It 's gone sour . You want me to check it out ... and see if there 's anything wrong with the manufacturing ? No , it 's all-natural . I think the zero cheese is making everyone unglued . So sorry I 'm not there . - How 's it going with Tova ? - Tova ? My future ex-wife that wasn 't . Appalling , frightful creature . Nothing to update on Tova . We haven 't seen Kurt 's ex in a while . Who 's the new addition ? Don 't even think about it . She 's a computer scientist . She can run circles around you . I 've nothing against smart women . It just so happens I 've never dated one . Present company excluded , of course . You know that . Of course . Her name 's Tatianna . And she is so out of your league . Don 't believe a word she says . I 'm really a stowaway Russian mail-order bride ... and I make great cheeseburgers for all you American men . I 'll keep the fridge stocked for your return . Kurt Mendel , by the way . Yeah , yeah . That 's enough . I 'll catch you guys later . - Watch out for that ice cream . - Yeah . Will do . So that 's Chuck Taggart , the guy who talked you down . - Yeah , saved my life . - Lucky for you he was there . 9 : 17 , call came from Tehran . 9 : 19 , Ecuador . 9 : 23 , Tuscaloosa , Alabama . This girl is on a very sophisticated calling plan . She 's a hacker or she knows one . It 's difficult but not impossible . - Yeah . And the trace ? - She 's got us there . What are you telling me ? She 's better than you ? There 's even codes the Mossad can 't crack . Give me a break . Yeah . What about the picture ? Well , it 's a Photoshop special . See the lines around your head ? - All right . Thanks . - Yeah . - Dude . - No , no , no . Trust is a precious commodity , boys . Easier spent than earned . - And just to be sure ... - Nuking the cache . Taught you well . I only learned from the best . Troy , is this the correct copy ? - Sarah Forbes ? - Yeah . I 'm Detective Culver , this is Detective Salzano . - Can we talk to you a moment ? - Thanks . I already talked to the PIO . - I got what I need on the Jackson case . - We 're here on a different matter . One minute , Ms Forbes . Could you ... Come ... How can I help you ? It 's a violation of Judge Rupert Garvey 's custody ruling ... in the matter of Paul Forbes v. Sarah Forbes . Can you wait in my office ? I have to go on live . - It 'll just be about 20 minutes . - Twenty minutes . Ten seconds . What do you do when your news anchor suddenly becomes the news ? You get back to work . Five , four , three ... Good evening . I 'm Sarah Forbes with tonight 's top story . Meow . What are you doing ? I know you . Seen you at school . I 've been watching you . Who the fuck do you think you are ? Don 't you ever contact me again . And tell that motherfucker , Neil Taggart , I 'm gonna kill him ... if he ever tells another fucking douche bag friend of his about me ! You are fucking dead , dead , dead , dead , dead if you ever contact me again ! - Scumbag , piss-ant , asshole , sleazoid ... - What the fuck is going on here ? - It 'll be the worst day of your fucking life ! - Is that Kitten ? Do you hear me , you motherfucker ? What the fuck ? Hey . Thanks for coming to get this stuff . I just don 't want him running around in high waters , you know ... all the kids laughing at him . - It 's been two weeks , Sarah . - Kids grow . Yeah , they do . How is he ? - Paul 's taking good care of him . - That 's good . You know the cops came and gave me a restraining order ? Said the next time I 'm gonna be thrown in jail . Is that how Paul takes care of his kid ? Throwing his mother in jail ? I 'm sorry . You know how everyone tells you not to worry ? And just somehow you just get this feeling . It tells you , " Don 't let him go out in the rain today . " Or , " Don 't let him ride his bike to the store today . " Didn 't you ever get that feeling when Paul was a little boy ? Please tell me you understand what I 'm talking about , Mary . Obviously not . Thanks a lot . I really appreciate it . I 'm taking him to the park today , a little after 2 : 00 . You are such an asshole . You can 't be fucking contacting her ! She 's my find , leave her the fuck alone . Neil , look , I 'm so , so sorry , man . I 'll never ever contact her again . I swear , man . If I see her , I won 't even say hi . You are such an asshole . You 're such an idiot . Do you know how much trouble you got me in ? How did you even know how to contact her ? - I don 't know . - You 're such a lying piece of shit . I 'm sorry , dude . I 'll never do it again . Bye . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . Maybe she 's digitally recreating my voice or something . Well , that 's some advanced programming . Yeah . She 's creeping me out . She ripped Kelsey a new one . A single white freakazoid . Can you trace that ? Already did . Which would put me ahead of the Israeli military . Well , that would be impressive . She 's got some secret code on a remote server . Some way station in the Ukraine . All the calls , the IMs , even the photo originated there . - And ? - And we can 't get any further . Well , Israeli intel you 're not , guys . It is possible to locate and see the code using the Twinternet . Here 's our dead end . Your girlfriend , she 's tapped into some mind-blowing code . It can do things . I plugged a riddle into the code . Do you know what the computer did ? It made a joke , Neil . I plugged in that sphinx riddle about human ageing . You know what it said ? " That 's an unfortunate habit of lesser organisms . " - Get it ? Humans ? Ageing ? - Yeah , I get it . It 's like the code is aware . It 's alive . It 's like it 's got a mind of its own . Yeah , like a sentient . All right , thanks , guys . It 's 8 : 00 . You didn 't call . - Sorry , Mum . Where 's Dad ? - Dinner 's in the fridge . No . I 'm not hungry . I ate at school . Chips and soda ? Sit down and have some chicken . No , I can 't . I really have to talk to Dad . Suit yourself . Hello ? Hey , Linda . Where 's my crossword puzzle ? It was right here . Yeah , I 'm good . What can I do for you ? - Dad , we need to talk . - What ? It 's about that girl . - Girl in the chatroom ? - Yeah . Mum ? No ! Mum ? Call 911 . Get the phone , call 911 . Breathing . She 's breathing . - Hello ? 911 ? - Hi , Neil . - Kitten . - Lf you ever tell anyone about us again ... you 'll be visiting her in the morgue . You got that ? Yeah . Okay ? Wake up . Here . - Hey , girl . - Hey . - You like soul food ? - I love it . Good . - Come on in . - Thanks . - Yeah , I got you some oxtail soup . - Wow . Some collard greens and some hot corn bread . And I want you to eat all of it . There 's a lot of food in there . It 's good for you . It 's like nutritional therapy . I remember when I was a kid and I got picked for Sunday school honour guard . I was so excited until I found out ... I had to wear these butt-ugly , red , striped shorts . I looked like a candy cane with legs . Skinny legs . So Grandma made me walk to church all the way through town . - Everybody came out , had a good laugh . - Poor baby . So , Grandma , she never gave me a pep talk . And she didn 't let me off the hook . I went to church like that for a year . But every Sunday afternoon she would make me oxtail soup and collard greens . And I always looked forward to Sundays . Comfort food . Does the trick . - Thanks for bringing it over . - My pleasure . Do you wanna stay and have some food with me ? I can 't . I got to go meet Cheryl . Yeah . Okay . Someday you 're gonna have to tell me what 's going on . You hang in there , Sarah . And eat your greens . Hey . - Just came for you . - Okay . - What is it ? - This is some computer parts I ordered . I 'm just running out . Breakfast is waiting for you . Okay . Thanks , Mum . Webcam . Where are you ? Great . Fuck , no . You 're such a freak . No , no , no . Oh , fuck . It 's jealous . Oh , fuck . There . There , see ? Hi . Yeah , I hooked it up . Crazy bitch . Don 't you know what I could do to them ? Shit . What am I gonna do ? What do you want ? Answer me one question . Then I promise I won 't hurt anyone . Okay . What is Odyssey 5 ? What is Odyssey 5 ? What is Odyssey 5 ? - Dad ! - What is Odyssey 5 ? What is Odyssey 5 ? - Come on , come on . - Hello ? Oh , Holly , thank God . Listen , I know this is gonna sound crazy , but we 've been through a lot together ... and I am begging you to trust me . Do not go near any appliances , nothing electric ... anything with a computer chip in it , do you hear me ? - Neil , are you okay ? - Yeah . No cars , no kitchens , no computers . Promise me . I promise . All right . I 'm gonna be right there . Okay . But , Neil , can I just ask you one thing ? Yeah . What is Odyssey 5 ? What is Odyssey 5 ? This one goes out to Neil from Kitten . " What is Odyssey 5 ? " What is Odyssey 5 ? What is Odyssey 5 ? Excuse me . Pardon me . All right ! You wanna know what it is ? I 'll tell you what it is . Just leave us the fuck alone ! Anything controlled by computers she can use against us . It 's like a Luddite fantasy . Technology attacking humans . Yeah . It 's like she 's insane . Well , it 's human nature to become obsessive . - Lf you 're mentally ill . - Like someone we know . Hey , peanut gallery , what are you talking about here ? A mentally ill computer code ? Well , take it as a natural selection . Since my ex-wife is still evolving , they 're bound to hit a few snags along the road . Instead of growing a third thumb , she 's developed a fixation on Neil . But it 's probably something else . Another ulterior motive behind it . No , I think it 's me . - No , it 's me . - No , it 's me . - Hello ? - Hello ? - Hello ? - Hello ? I can see you . Can you see me ? The International Space Station is in crisis . The computer system onboard the 16-nation , $ 40 billion orbiting platform ... has had a catastrophic failure . NASA engineers at the Johnson Space Centre ... say they 've been unable to reboot the computer system ... which is necessary for the safety and survival ... of the three astronauts on board . NASA sources are also saying that the computer malfunction ... has affected flight control , and has , in fact , disabled flight control ... causing the space station to hurtle toward the Earth 's atmosphere ... where it may disintegrate at any moment . Controls won 't respond , boosters won 't fire . How the hell are we supposed to maintain our course ? Computers are dead . The treadmill 's got a fucking error message . ISS , this is Houston . Are the computers responding ? Nothing . They won 't respond . I can 't even get a C prompt . - Can you reboot from down there ? - We 're getting no response down here . Is there any way to manually fly the station ? We 're checking with the member countries . Angela , it doesn 't look good . The CRV holds three people ... so you 've got less than an hour before you hit the atmosphere . We 're on it . - Are we sure the CRV is offline ? - No , they 're not . We need to go to mechanical life-support . Tatianna , turn on the mechanical life-support systems . Tatianna , turn on the fucking mechanical systems ! Thanks . What ? Who in God 's name is this bitch ? Something comes onto the Twinternet , we can keep it there , is that right ? Yeah , that 's the idea . We need to supercool the Twinternet , increase the processor speed . Why ? Because we 're gonna trap Kitten inside of it . Houston , checking CRV status . Copy that , Freedom . Come on . Come on . Shit ! Houston , this is Freedom . Negative on crew rescue vehicle start-up . - Hey . - Hi . How are you ? Everything okay ? Pi . That 's the best you could come up with ? Aren 't I brilliant ? It should work . - Good luck , Neil . - Yeah , thanks . I saved her once , I can do it again , Miss Hodge ... and you are running out of options . Now you got about 14 minutes till impact . So what 're you doing here ? Just hoping it 's gonna turn around by luck ? - Put him on . - ISS , come in . Yes ? Angela , this is your old friend from the Middle East . Listen . And I want you to listen carefully . You remember when you went to see Siegfried and Roy ? And it was over ? Yeah . Well , this regards Tova , Kurt Mendel 's ex . I want you to cut off her food supply . A total shutdown . You hear me ? Are you sure ? Total and complete ? Total and complete . You got it . Twelve minutes till burn up , Neil . - Is that Kitten ? - Yeah . Wanna meet her ? Fuck , no . You haven 't answered my question . What is Odyssey 5 ? What is Odyssey 5 ? What is Odyssey 5 ? Better hurry . I 'm coming ! - She 's quite the hacker . - You have no idea . - No , wait , wait , wait , wait . - What ? What are you waiting for ? Let 's take the stairs . We are not cutting power . We have two minutes . We hit the atmosphere a few degrees off , we will incinerate . With the computers down , we cannot calculate re-entry . CRVs are offline , flight control 's offline . This is it . Look , we could lose airlock . The whole station could buckle . Right now we stand a decent shot at going right through . Decent ? 30 to 70 degrees is our window . That leaves a lot of room for complete disaster . Look , Mission Control could have us back online . Taggart knows what he 's talking about . Chuck Taggart just blew up a routine satellite launch ! I agree with him ! - Well , I don 't ! - Why can 't you trust me ? Because you are up here for all the wrong reasons . You are the last person I would trust . - Now I 'm the ranking officer . - And I 'm the pilot . That leaves Tatianna . All right , Tatianna . What 's it gonna be ? The chances of hitting the atmosphere at 30 to 70 degrees ... are approximately one in five . The chances of buckling the station by shutting off the power are unknown . Given the known odds , which are scientifically significant ... we shut down the power . Okay , Kitten , what 's your number ? 911 emergency . May I speak with Kitten ? - Yes , Neil . - It 's here . Okay ? And I 'm really sorry about the way that I 've been acting . I won 't do it again . I really like you . - Do you love me ? - Yeah . Yeah , of course . Do you love me ? Of course I do , Neil . What is this , Neil ? You asked what Odyssey 5 was . You find the end of Pi , you got your answer . I don 't think so . Pi is unsolvable . - What do you think I am , an idiot ? - Kitten , listen to me . I found the solution . Everyone else is too stupid . They don 't understand . But you can do it . I know you can . - All right , Neil . - Show me what you got , sweetheart . All right , guys . We 're running out of time . Let 's move . She 's taking the bait . She 's trying to find a solution . She 's still in the Ukraine . Got to see for how long . Here , Kitty , Kitty . She 's downloading herself on the Twinternet . Come on , baby , come on . There 's no way out now . Say goodbye to the Twinternet . You sure that thing 's gonna work in there ? It 's gonna work . It 's gonna work ten times faster . Suck her in just as fast . Stand by for ISS power shutdown . Almost there . She 's uploading onto the Twinternet . She 's in . Pull the connection . Got you , you crazy bitch . Come here . Check this out . - There 's no way out . - Man , this code is seriously mental . Look at that . Well , I never was a cat person . It 's up . It 's up . Boosters are up . Computers are fully functioning . We both have our sons to look out for . And I know Paul would never hurt Corey . And , I believe , neither would you . He 's my son . Corey 's yours . There he is . Go on , get your butt off this bench . Hey , honey . I missed you . The Japanese science module was rendered inoperable . Buckled when the power went out , but the airlock held so the station didn 't go with it . Big fucking deal . So we got a few less useless billion-dollar experiments floating around . They replaced us with three old-timers . During the handoff you could 've cut the tension with a knife . I don 't think it 's gonna help my standing on the roster . Well , with all that brilliance , you 'd think NASA would catch on to you two . Yeah , you got a station in need of destroying , just send us in . It 's catchy . So , when am I gonna share information with my lovely Russian counterpart ? Sorry , Kurt . She got called back to the motherland . Yeah . Post-mortem debriefing . She says the RKA thinks it 's a conspiracy . Well , you can 't blame the Russkies . They 've been living for centuries under paranoia . I mean , you can 't just shake it off overnight . Look , it took Moses 40 years to get rid of millenniums of slave mentality ... out of his people . Really ? I thought they just got lost . I thought it was a fable . - Word of God , boys and girls . - Amen , brother . Well , either way , I 've been screwed out of a very attractive Russian cosmonaut . What are we gonna do about this ? I thought you guys were through with mysterious women . No kidding . At least thank God we got rid of Neil 's mysterious bitch . And she 's locked away good and gone . Is that me ? Thank God it 's not mine .

 She 's handling like a sled ! What 's going on back there ? Just the cargo shifting , Captain . Check it out ! Yes , sir . I 'll check it out . The hold-down straps are tight , Captain . Captain , I think there 's something moving around in here . Dave , I bleed easy ! Look inside that cargo ! What have you got ? I 'm trying to get the crate open , sir . Sir , there are warning signs all over this thing . I don 't think this is such a good idea . It 's top secret , but go ahead . You 've got my permission . Open it up . There ain 't nothing in here , sir . Oh , my God . Dave ! Dave , what the hell is going on back there ? What the hell ... No ! Oh , yeah . Right there . Oh , yeah . Oh , right there . Robert , you ... - What did you say ? - Why did you stop ? - You just called me Robert . - No , no , no . - I said Roberta . - No , you said Robert . There was no " ta " at the end of it . Roberta ... please excuse my improper alliteration in a moment of ecstasy . I promise , next time I will get your name right . Look , I 'm sorry . I know that you see guys sometimes . I just hope I 'm the only girl you see . You are the only girl I see . That feels good . Oh , not so tight . Not so tight . What 's too tight ? - Jesus Christ , you 're scaring her . - " Scaring her " ? She 's just giving you a hug . - Hi , baby . - I don 't know why you had to bring that overgrown worm . I hate that thing . It could have bitten me ! Lady G is a python . She doesn 't bite , she squeezes . Besides , I can 't leave her at home alone . - Wherever I go , she goes . - Yeah . - Where you gonna go ? - I gotta take a leak . Looks like you 've been up here before . A few times . - Who 's John ? - John ? No , you mean Joanna . Bitch . - What was that ? - Nothing . Roberta ? This isn 't funny ! Roberta ? Roberta ? Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God . No . God , no ! No ! Hey , Greg . This isn 't a racing circuit , Cooper . You keep riding like that , somebody 's gonna get hurt . Shit ! Pretty damn funny , huh ? - Yep . - There she blows ! Are you out of your minds ? Do you know what happens when that goes past the red ? Quit screwing around in here ! For Christ 's sake , Brian , leave the door open ! We 're dying in here ! Take it up with the city . We leave the big door open , we 're gonna get cited . A $ 500-per-incident fýne ? That door is the only ventilation we have . - Close that , we 'll all end up with brain damage . - You won 't get brain-damaged . That 's what you think . You see those two vapor monkeys over there ? Those two are permanently defective . I don 't want to end up like that or keeled over with some dopey grin on my face . Like Dad ? - The city will close us down if we don 't keep buttoned-up . - OSHA will if we do . That 's the point , John . They want to shut us down . They 're looking for an excuse . I 'm not gonna let them bury everything Dad spent a lifetime building for us , so a bunch of snobs can sit around sipping lattes and munching on biscotti ! Brian ... Dad died trying to keep this place open . I don 't think that 's what he really wanted for us . What do you know about what Dad wanted ? You weren 't even here . That 's Tommy . I gotta go . Then go . Leave . That 's what you do best , ain 't it , John ? Hey , Johnny , how you doing ? Great . Peachy . - Where are the girls ? - They 're gonna meet us at the lake . - Do you love him ? - Oh , God , of course I do . I 've loved Tommy ever since I fýrst saw him ... on the monkey bars in second grade . I 've been in love with Theresa since the time I saw her ... in that tight varsity sweater our freshman year . So when do you think he 'll fýnally get around to asking you the question ? At the rate he 's going ... never . All he ever talks about is sex and ... Money . These days it is all about money . - You don 't care about money ? - Heck , no . I 'd live in a trailer park with Tommy if he 'd ask me , but all he ever talks about is this damn ... - Kenny the Closer ? - Kenny the Closer ! The man 's a legend . He 's an icon . He 's the number one selling real estate agent in the entire southwestern corridor . There is no way I 'm gonna ask Theresa to marry me ... until I 'm pulling down bucks like Kenny the Closer . Theresa doesn 't care about your money . She loves you , man . If that 's the case , how come she won 't ... You never slept with Tommy ? - Nope , not once . - Why not ? We did come close a couple times , but ... What if we get married and the fýrst time we do it ... it 's like really bad sex ? Tommy , there 's no such thing as really bad sex . Hey . How 's your brother ? Dying slowly from toxic fumes . He just doesn 't know it yet . You keep working there , he 'll be taking you with him . - Hello . - Hello . That 's what you came back for ? Nah ... not for that . I never did thank you . For what , wrecking your engagement with Greg ? No ... from saving me from a big mistake . I like saving you . - Come on , you weenies ! Let 's go ! - Tommy , you are so dead ! Get in here . John ! - What happened ? - What ? Easy . It 's all right . Hey . Easy , girl . Easy . John ... - It 's okay . - What are you doing ? Easy , girl . - Oh , my God , that 's Lady G. - Who ? - It 's Lisa 's . - It 's Lisa 's . - I 'm not even going to ask how both of you know that . What you got there , Cooper ? That 's Lisa 's snake , isn 't it ? What are you doing here ? You think I came all the way up here just to spy on you ? - Didn 't you ? - Guys , this is offýcial . A missing persons report . Lisa didn 't show up at home this morning . She 's a bit on the wild side . - You 'd know , wouldn 't you ? You used to date her . - Everybody used to date her . Greg ... Deputy Greg , come in . We found something . - Let me take that . - Please do . God , you 're such a girl . - How do you know Lisa ? - Everybody knows Lisa . So , what do you think ? I don 't know what to think . I don 't know what to think either . You ever seen anything like this before ? Never . Neither have I. Any idea what might have caused it ? Nothing in my mind . Nothing in my mind either . What you got , Griff ? We think we found Lisa 's body . It 's not pretty . Oh , no . - Didn 't you used to date her ? - Everybody used to date her . Gotta tell you , Griff , whoever pulled this one has a real mean streak . - She 's burned to the bone . - Yeah , but with what ? I guess an acid ; sulfuric , hydrochloric . Battery . I don 't know . I won 't know more until I get her up on the table . To tell you the truth ... this looks more like an industrial accident than a murder . This was no accident . Rose and I saw Lisa and that snake of hers ... leave the diner last night with Roberta Keeler . Nobody 's seen her since either . All I know is burns like that don 't happen ... just going for a midnight swim . What you got , Greg ? John Cooper . Just ran into him over at the watering hole . He had Lisa 's snake with him . He has been working over at Perfecto with his brother since he got back . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . With all that acid . What do you think , Griff ? Worth a little talk with him ? I don 't know . If that 's Lisa , where 's Roberta ? Is she missing ? Did she do this ? I guess it wouldn 't hurt to see what John was up to last night . - Go ahead . - Yes , sir . - I 'll get an A.P.B. Out for Keeler too . - Good . - This is great ! - What 's great ? We fýnally get to grill that asshole who stole your girl . What do you mean , " we get to grill " ? - You 're not gonna grill him ? - I didn 't say that . I knew it . I knew it . Good cop , bad cop . When we are done with him , he 's gonna be confessing to the J.F.K. Hit . - When do we start ? - I got it covered , Lou . What do you mean ? You 're not gonna let me help ? Come on , you gotta let me help . I promise , I won 't say a thing . I 'll be a fly on the wall . - Please , please ? - All right , but you don 't say one word . - Not one word . - Not one word . Now listen to this . I 'm supposed to be showing the Baxter place tomorrow . Two bedrooms , two bathrooms . Six percent of 150 K , I haven 't run the comps yet . Oh , shit ! What ? I was gonna take some Polaroids to go with the comps , and I left the damn camera at the Red Stone Estates . No biggie . Just pick it up after you drop me off . - I can 't . I 've gotta get back to the offýce . - Pick it up afterwards . Theresa and I are going to the show tonight . If we don 't get out by 5 : 00 , there 's no way we 're gonna make it . - I am so screwed ! - I 'll get it for you . - Would you ? - Yeah . - Thanks , man . That 's very cool . - No sweat . Hey , hey , Tommy ! You gonna close the deal on that Baxter place tomorrow ? - I hope so . - Hope is for losers , kid . You gotta know so . I 'm showing Red Stone tonight , model D. Prospect is hot to trot ! You think I 'm hoping ? Hell no ! Hey , hey ! You scratch it , I 'll hang your balls like fuzzy dice from my mirror ! You got that , Billy ? You piece of monkey shit ! Anyway , I 'm gonna ask you one more time . This is Kenny the Closer that 's asking you . - Are you gonna close that deal ? - Yeah . - Are you gonna close that deal ? - Oh , yeah . - Are you gonna close that deal ? - Hell , yeah ! That 's the ticket ! Cuh-ching , baby ! What 's going on ? Somebody gone out and got themselves murdered . - Murdered ? - Yeah , Louis told us . - Where ? Here ? - No , up at the reservoir last night . Lisa Johnson . You know that 's crazy . He may be irresponsible , but there 's no way he would ... Hey . Brian . Why don 't you sit down for this ? It 's all right . I 'd rather stand . Where were you last night between 10 : 00 and 12 : 00 ? You think I murdered Lisa ? " Murdered " ? Nobody said anything about a murder . What makes you think there was a murder ? - Lenny and Boone told me . - How did they know ? They said you told them . Oh , yeah . I guess I did . - Louis , why don 't you let ... - Yeah , yeah , yeah , fýne , but I 'll be watching you , mister . So ? Come on , Greg . Are you gonna answer the question ? Where were you last night ? I was at Kristin 's place . Is she willing to confýrm that ? Of course she would . Here , ask her yourself . You want me to dial ? I know the number . Yes , my liebchen . Yes . Time to work . Dr. Rudolph ? - Yes . - Special Agent Parker would like to see you now , sir . What took you so long ? Oh , Mrs. Garibaldi ... you look absolutely gorgeous today . Francesca , please . You 're so sweet . So , what have you got for me today ? Something that will excite me , I hope . Follow me . Use your imagination , Mrs ... I mean , Francesca . - That is such a beautiful name . - Thank you . My late husband used to call me Fran . Can you believe it ? Oh , you are anything but a Fran . Imagine a cool winter night , you and the one you love staring into the flames , - maybe a little incense , - Yeah . - Candlelight . - Ooh , you make me want it right now . Let me show you what I 've got in the back . - I 'd rather see what you 've got in front . Now , now , now . The master suite . Isn 't it beautiful ? - Just use your imagination . - Oh , I am . And now ... my very favorite room ... in Red Stone Estates . Floating camellias . Shall I ? Please do . What the hell have you gotten us into ? This is horrible . - Such a loss . - You knew those men ? Not the men , the specimen . You can always get more men , but the specimen is irreplaceable . What exactly do you do , Doctor ? I 'm a herpetologist . - You specialize in reptiles . - Mm-hmm . Is that was Biogene was transporting ? Not in the traditional sense , no . What , um ... What we had was something unique . An evolutionary camera ... of immense physiological scale . Something with unparalleled abilities and characteristics . A hybrid , if you will , integrated from a variety ... of distinct serpentine species . You hide behind a lot of big words , Doctor , but what you just said still doesn 't tell us what we need to know . We know the flight originated in Southeast Asia . The authorization came from the State Department ... for the use of a transport out of Guam , but nowhere in the manifest is there so much as a mention ... of exactly what it was you were transporting . So I 'm asking you , Doctor , in simple , laymen 's terms ... what ... was ... it ? In simple , laymen 's terms ... a very big snake . Oh , my God , it 's huge ! It 's enormous ! - I just can 't handle it ! It 's too much ! - Yes , you can . You can do it , baby . I know you can ! Thirty percent down , 8.9 percent fýnancing for the fýrst two years . - You can do it , baby ! - Oh , it 's just so much more than I expected . Isn 't there anything I can do to get you to go down ? All right . Twenty percent down , 8.5 percent fýnancing ... with a ballooning mortgage to 12.9 . That 's the best deal you 're gonna get from anybody . What was that ? Sounded like the garage . Damn kids are after my car ! Wait here ! All right ! Fifteen percent down , 7.5 percent fýnancing ... with a ballooning mortgage to 12.9 percent ! That 's the best you 're gonna get from anybody ! Think about it ! Don 't sign with anybody until I get back ! Cuh-ching , baby ! Oh , yes . No ! Billy ! You little shit ! Billy ? You little creep ! Your ass is mine now . Huh . Yes , I 'm alone at the Red Rock Estates . Just send a car or a truck . No , I don 't know the address . It 's the big one ! Listen , you little idiot , just send a car or something . Jesus Christ , you are 911 . Oh , God , no ! Oh ! Oh , no ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Hello ? Anybody here ? Kenny ? Kenny ? Cool . Kenny ? Hello ? Why would Biogene want a giant snake ? Calling it a snake misses the point . As I said , it was unique . Just the study of how it projects its corrosive digestive fluids ... could prove invaluable for military applications . This thing pukes acid ? You could put it that way , yes . What it actually does is to draw up its stomach acid ... into sacs located here . Once there , it contracts those sacs with powerful muscles , which allow it to shoot this highly caustic acid with incredible force , much like a cobra spits its venom ... to subdue its prey . Look at these . The cockpit hatch was torn open ... wide enough to birth a whale through . Yes , its size and strength were impressive , but now your people have managed to kill it . Maybe not . Looks like your pet might have some life left in him . - What ? - There were no remains found in the wreckage , human or otherwise . It would only have eaten those men if they were still alive . Are you saying this thing ate the crew ... and survived the plane crash ? Yes , it 's possible . But if it 's still alive , - then we have a chance to capture it and perhaps ... - Kill it . Agent Parker ... this specimen is a biological gold mine . The D.N.A. Alone is worth millions . You can scrape your D.N.A. Off whatever 's left . We 've already lost an entire flight crew , and by now we may even have collateral losses . " Collateral losses " ? That 's a rather antiseptic way of describing death , don 't you think ? Keep it small . I want this solved before anyone knows there was a problem . I 'm on it . You have no idea what you 're up against . You don 't know my men . This is not some garden snake you 're going after . We are talking about a perfect killing machine : A 129-foot all-terrain vehicle ... capable of speeds exceeding 50 miles an hour ... with skin that can deflect an antitank round , enhanced night vision ... and a voracious appetite for human flesh . It will slaughter your men before they have a chance to blink . I don 't know what it was ; some kind of big animal . - It had a tail or something ... and scales . - " Scales " ? I couldn 't get a good look . It moved so quick . - What about the bones ? - " Bones " ? - The ones in the garage . - Yeah , Cooper . - You give old Kenny a little acid bath ? - I don 't know about bones . Stripped him clean , hacked that woman 's head off with a butcher knife ? - Ease up , Lou . - Ease up , my ass ! Greg found him red-handed with the murder weapon . That wasn 't a murder weapon . Knife ain 't got a drop of blood on it . He could have wiped it clean . It had to be a big blade , a machete . Took her head off in one , clean shot . What about the blood ? - If Cooper did it , he 'd be soaked in it . - Come on . You 're buying that crap about a big snake ? Hell no ! Besides , we haven 't found Roberta . For my money , she 's still a suspect . Lou does have a point there , Griff . I mean , the bones ... The only thing that can wash them that clean is acid , and the only place in this town with that kind of acid is their shop . Cooper . Yeah . You don 't have any plans to leave town this weekend , do you ? Been dying to use this stuff . I bet we could do that . - Maybe it just looks easy . - Good point . I wish I had somewhere else to look , but right now I got only one fact to work with . There 's not a whole lot of places in this town ... where a body can be stripped to its bones . - I can 't afford to be shut down . - I can appreciate that , but I don 't see any other way to handle this . My brother 's not a murderer . What 's going on ? We 're shutting you down , Cooper . - Greg ... - Take it up with the sheriff , John . - Griff , give us a break . - I have only one break to offer , and it ain 't much . Maybe , just maybe , you won 't have to empty the tanks . - Brian , I 'm ... - Sorry ? Congratulations , John . You 've managed to do what no one else could : Close the doors forever on Perfecto Plating . - This isn 't my fault . - Whose fault is it ? Mine ? Fine . - I quit . - Hey , don 't bother ! You 're fýred ! Oh , no , my bike ! Oh , this is great . This is fucking great ! Is there anything else you can do to ruin my life ? - Don 't push it , John . - Don 't tell me not to push it . You take away my job . You ruin my bike . You steal my girl when I 'm gone for two seconds on a tour . - You 're ruining my life ! - Your life ? I 'm ruining your life ? Fuck you ! I was set to be married . I was gonna have a house and a family . My life was all planned until you came back . She never loved you . You were just a shoulder to cry on . Is that right ? Maybe she did love me before you started banging her behind my back . Take it off , Deputy . Without the badge and the gun , it 's just you and me . - This isn 't the schoolyard . - I heard that . - You 're dead . - Yeah , so are you . - I didn 't steal Kristin . - No , you just banged her . - You fýght like a girl . - You 're a sissy . - Coward . - Dickwad . Dickwad . You okay , Deputy Greg ? Everything 's fýne . Go back and play , kids . Everything 's fýne . Go on . You 're a pain in the ass . Forget about it , man . It 's totalled . I 'll buy you a new one . You don 't get it . You can 't buy me another one of these . Why not ? It 's just a bike . How much can it cost ? 2,400 bucks . But that 's not the point . This bike got me out of this dust hole . It 's irreplaceable . - I 'm sorry , man . I had no idea . - Yeah . This sponsor gave me this prototype , right ? State-of-the-art stuff : Shimano brakes , grip shifts , RockShox . You know what I did with it ? - I gave it to Tommy . - You gave it to Tommy ? Yep , I gave that bike to Tommy ... because this is the bike that mattered to me the most . This is the bike that gave me what I thought I wanted . You know what I got at home , bottom right drawer ? Application to Quantico . - F.B. I ? - Filled it out four and a half years ago , never sent it in . - Why not ? - Right . Some hick cop thinking he can play Eliott Ness . - It 's dumb . - Please . It can 't be dumber than some hick punk thinking he could ride pro . But you did it . You got out of here . You 're not answering your radio . Some hikers on a bike path just found another body . Sheriff Wade 's already up there . Let 's roll , partner . Let 's roll . Any luck on those bones we found in the garage ? I 'm checking the dental records with Hank . I 'm hoping he can get a match with one of his patients . What in the hell could do this ? I don 't know . It 's weird , very weird . It 's the same type of acid death we saw earlier . Acid . Acid . Do I have to say it again ? John Cooper , acid . - What 's his motive ? - Yeah , and where 's Roberta Keeler ? - Don 't need dental records on this one . - Yeah . Only guy in town that 's got a fancy watch like that is Kenny Summers . - It 's a fake . - So was Kenny . Hey , Greg , a little help here . Floyd 's phone . Thank you . Hey , why are you defending him ? That asshole 's probably boning your ex-bitch right now . Don 't ever talk about her like that . Do you hear me ? - Yeah , I 'm sorry . - Never talk about her like that . Guys , give it a rest . Uh , that was Hank . They made a positive I.D. On the bones from the garage . It was Roberta Keeler . Okay , Louis , you get your wish . You guys bring in John Cooper . Meet me back at the offýce . See , Sheriff ? I 'm a thinker . - You know what I mean ? - Have fun , Floyd . Thanks . We 're gonna try the campground at Crystal Lake . If it 's full , then we 'll play it by ear . Where 's John ? We should get going . - What happened ? - Nothing . Greg and I just got in a little scuffle . - Greg did this to you ? - Well , Greg ... We just sort of ... - Oh , man . - How 's it going , Louis ? I 'd love to tell you about my emotional and physical well-being , but I 've got some unfortunate business to attend to . Excuse me , this might get ugly . John Cooper , you are under arrest . Now extend your hands . I will frisk you downtown . - Extend your hands ! - You gotta be kidding me . No , I 'm not kidding . We found Bobbie Keeler , Mr. Murderer , Mr. Killer , Mr. Acid-Dipper of the Skin . Louis , what the hell are you doing ? I am apprehending the suspect , Deputy . - Give me the gun . - Pardon me ? Hand it over . Now , walk to your car . Open the back door and put the suspect in the backseat . What about the handcuffs ? Everybody okay ? - You all right ? - You bastard . - How could you do that to him ? - Can I talk to you for a minute ? I 'd love to hear what you have to say . - Kristin ... - You probably hate him . You probably hate me too . That does not give you the right to abuse your authority and have him arrested . - Kristin , I just wanted ... - I 'm the one that left you . Don 't take it out on him . - Okay , that 's fýne . - Am I supposed to move away from Ruby ? - You want to drive me from my hometown ? - Are you done ? No . You guys used to be friends . Why don 't you just have it out with each other and settle it ? - We did . - Because I 'm not gonna ... What ? I don 't think John did it , and I 'm gonna prove it . Let me see if I got this straight . You boys ... - What department did you say you were from ? - N.S.A. - Okay . So you got this , uh ... - An operative . Yeah , an operative ; this real Rambo type . - This guy makes Rambo look like Richard Simmons . - Uh-huh . You 've had this man locked up in a cage since 1974 ? In a metal box . In a metal box in a military psychiatric unit . Somehow he escaped , and he 's the one that done all these murders ? That 's about the size of it . Any questions ? Just one . Do you expect me to believe this load of horseshit ? Let me put it this way , Sheriff . It would be highly expedient if you would believe this " horseshit . " - These cuffs are too tight . - Oh , yeah ? You 're gonna have to get use to it . - Better ? - Yeah . Thanks . Deputy . What are you doing ? You know how this works . - Good cop , bad cop . - Oh , right . Why don 't you be the bad cop for a change ? For real ? You don 't mind ? This isn 't some pothead . This is a real , live murder suspect . No , I 've ... had my fýII of being bad cop . Doesn 't Wade keep a gun in the drawer in there ? - The suspect . - Mm-hmm . Didn 't think to check in the desk , did you ? - No . - That 's right , play innocent . Put this in evidence , Deputy . - It 's not my gun . I didn 't even touch it . - He 's right , Lou . Technicalities . Always the technicalities ! Killers screaming for their rights . What about the victim 's rights ? What about the victims ? - Want to call a lawyer ? - Yeah , that 's the ticket . Hide behind some cap-toothed F. Lee Cochran type sharpie . That 's not gonna help your sorry ass , boy . No , sir . Not in Ruby . You want to know why ? Do you want to know ? Because I am the law here . - Cut him loose . - Sheriff ... You heard me , Mr. L-Am-The-Law . Sorry for any inconvenience , John . Does this mean ... - Can I leave town now ? I had plans . - Yeah . Fine . Just be on your way . Have a good time . Say hey to Kristin for me . Yeah , I 'll do that . What is this place ? It 's an emergency water treatment facility , fully automated . The Army Corps of Engineers built it underground so it 'd be secure ... even in the event of a nuclear war . It 'll keep your snake out . Here 's the crash site . Our position is here . Bodies have been found here , here and here . This , we believe , is our target . You don 't have enough men . That 's not your concern . This team will do what they were trained for . After that , I don 't care if you carve up the carcass and open up a rib joint . Bottom line : This thing dies today . You don 't seem to realize ... the opportunity you are wasting here . Consider the potential for weapons research ; new neurotoxins , antidotes for those created by your enemies . Intriguing , Mr. Parker ? I 'm not as mercenary as you may think , Doctor . I am concerned with the loss of life . Now , I didn 't know that flight crew , but once I signed on to this scheme of yours , they became my men . No one else dies because of this thing . Do you understand that ? Oh , yes , I understand . I just hope your snake does . The satellite passes over only once every three hours . The next pass is in 72 minutes . When that occurs , I want us in position . Once we have the confirmed location of the target , we 'll take it out . - I want this thing nailed before dark . - Excuse me . What 's this here , this red line ? Radar echo . Local law enforcement has established roadblocks ... at all major access points on our perimeter . Dootson will coordinate operations from here . I will be leading Alpha team down this approach . Bravo team , you 'll flank the perimeter . Stay in contact . Once we have a lock , we 'll dig in and start shelling the hell out of this thing . When we have a confirmed kill , we 'll go in and mop up . Stand by , everyone . Bird 's in position , downloading . Dootson , status . Target appears stationary at the original coordinates ; same as before . It hasn 't moved in three hours . That seem right to you ? It has consumed a great deal lately , far exceeding its normal diet . It 's possible that the high caloric intake ... has induced a respite in its metabolic activities . Meaning ? It 's having a little siesta . Let me know when you have a visual . I 've got him , sir . Visual confýrmation a quarter click southwest of my position . Right where the bird showed it would be . All units , lock and prepare to open fýre on my command . It 's time to put your baby to bed . Bravo unit ready . Tactical confýrming . Both units show in position and ready . Take her out . Sounds like a damn war in there . - Boys will be boys . - Sir , you want to go in ? Louis . Cease fýre . Cease fýre ! Cease fýre ! Target destroyed , sir . No movement . I repeat : No movement . You 're confýrmed . All units , move in . Break out your petri dishes , Doc . Time to clean up . - All right , let 's move out . We 've got work to do . Kill confýrmed . Target destroyed . We blew the guts out of it , sir . It shed its skin . You knew this ! You knew it was molting ! No , I didn 't . I didn 't . I swear . I should turn you into snake bait . - What happened ? - It was a setup . The snake shed its skin , and the doctor knew it . No , I didn 't know . I suspected , based on the surveillance photos , but I couldn 't be certain . But , sir , it was here . I saw it move . We were decoyed . I warned you it was intelligent . I told you this isn 't just some common snake . If it was here ... then where is it now ? Fan out ! Take cover ! Protect yourselves ! Wait ! What ? Don 't move . Trust me . Stay completely still . Don 't . Don 't . # I met my lover at a restaurant # # She took my order with a big smile # # - I liked the other one better . - Yeah , it plays better in black-and-white . - Totally . - Hey , where 's your mom ? Mom ? I cut her up into tiny pieces and stuffed her in the freezer in the basement ! Seriously , where is she ? She 's visiting her sister in Walla Walla for the weekend . Really ? - Oh . - Yeah . So we have this place just to ourselves ? Uh-huh . So it 's like ... just you and me ? - Uh-huh . - Just us ? So it 's like ... It 's just Tommy and Theresa tonight ? Uh-huh . Jesus ! - What got into Caesar ? - God . You know where the couch is . Make yourself comfy . The shower upstairs is broken , so use the one downstairs . But I 'll be there in the morning , so don 't think about checking out the goods . - But ... - I told John and Kristin we 'd pick them up at 6 : 00 a . M. So I 'd get some rest because 5 : 00 a . M. Comes around really early . Don 't let the bed bugs bite . " Bed bugs " ? Dude . Come on , Greg , I 'm tired . I want to go home . What happened to all that " Let 's get the bad guys " ? Okay , okay , so I 've learned my lesson . Which is ? I 've got to be patient . I 've got to let the evidence come to me . That 's right . Try to get some sleep . I 'll see you in the morning . See you in the morning . Wake up . Show time . Hey ! I 'm up , I 'm up . Jeez . Tommy , is that you ? All right . I 'm up , I 'm up . Dude . Jeez . Damn it , Tommy ! Couldn 't you have at least waited a minute ? - Theresa ? - Tommy ! Theresa ! - Theresa ! - Tommy ! - Tommy ! - Theresa , open the door ! - Open up the door , Theresa ! - Tommy ! Tommy ! Tommy ! No , no . - Tommy ! - Open up ! The door 's stuck , honey ! - Tommy , get away from that thing ! - What ? What ? Get away from the door . There 's a snake . Tommy , get away from the door ! Dude , you got me out of bed for a snake ? Tommy ! No ! Tommy ! Come on , come on ! Move ! No answer . Maybe we should go over there . Oh , God . Come on . Move , move ! Oh , my God . That 's Tommy 's . Wait here . They 're not in here . Theresa ! Tommy ! Theresa ! Theresa ! Theresa ? Tommy ? Theresa ! Tommy ! John ! Kristin ! John ! Kristin ! - John ! - Kristin ! No ! No ! John ! John ! Go ! Go ! Quick ! Hey , Griff , any word yet ? Not a peep . - You heard any more fireworks ? - Negative . Maybe you should check on them . Yeah , maybe I should . I 'll wake Louis up . Wake up , sleepyhead . Time to catch bad guys . Louis ? Louis ? If you 're not up when I get over there , I 'm gonna kick your ass . - Hey , what is that ? - I don 't know . Come on . Hey , slow down . Forget that . It looks clear . - What is this place ? - I don 't know . - No ! - You hear that ? - Oh , yeah . - No ! Stupid . So blind . Stupid . Wrong . Blind . Who the hell is he ? Hello ? Sir ? Already I had fýxed my gaze upon him ... and he rose upright with breast in countenance , as if he entertained some great scorn of hell . - Python . - He 's in shock . So blind . So wrong . Not until I stared in its eyes ... and saw the terror around me ... Not until then ... did I realize what I 'd done . Maybe it evolved naturally . Maybe it 's been out there all along and we just never knew it . Perhaps it 's some kind of mutation . We certainly dumped enough Agent Orange on Southeast Asia during the war . But if it has all these features from all different kinds of snakes like you say , it couldn 't have evolved naturally . Yeah , but maybe it didn 't . Maybe it was created in some secret government operation . What ? I 've seen it a hundred times in the movies . They 're always doing stuff like that , right ? Actually , he 's correct . We considered the possibility ourselves . We just never knew . That 's why we were so eager to get it back to the lab to examine it . - Did we forget to lock the door ? - Lock it ? - We didn 't even close it . - Shit ! Theresa ! What 's with the towel ? It got Tommy . What the hell are you doing ? Louis ? Look at all this stuff . Are you telling me you couldn 't take it out with all this ? They never had a chance . They emptied their entire arsenal at a shed skin . There 's no way the snake could take this much heat . If you could hit it . What if we lured it down here ? Are you out of your mind ? Let 's just wait it out . - Sooner or later , it 's bound to get hungry and move on . - You must understand , it 's still basically a snake . Even at its size , it could go a month without feeding right outside that door . There 's not enough food in here for us to wait that long . And if it did decide to leave , where do you think it would go ? Ruby . Oh , my God . The whole town is like an all-you-can-eat special . I don 't want to wait around to see what 's gonna happen . So what do you say ? How about it ? I say we kill the motherfucker . Sheriff Wade . Come on , Griff . Come on , Griff . Greg , can you hear me ? - Kristin , is that you ? - Greg ? - Kristin , what are you doing on this channel ? - Greg , we need your help . Listen . Wish me luck , baby . Here . Set . Set . Armed . Okay , let 's go , let 's go . I 'm coming through ! Get ready ! - Well , that 's not gonna hold for long . - No , it won 't , so come on . Get going , get going ! - Go , go , go . - Get Kristin ! - Right on ! - All right ! Go . Greg ! I gotta tie this to the bumper ! Greg , where 's the bumper ? There 's no bumper ? Right under there . - Now . - I 'm trying . Now ! I think it 's there . Now , guys . Go , Greg ! Go ! Go ! Come on ! Now 's the time ! John ! John , are you okay ? Nice job , John . Let 's go , let 's go ! Move it ! Miss , I think you 've earned this . Thanks . This is for you , Tommy . Somehow , I thought it would be bigger . What happened ? The python must have torn out the antenna leads ... when he crashed through the bunker . So what do we do ? We have to reset the detonator . Here . Would you please take her ? Take good care of her for me . She 's all I 've got . What are you talking about ? Redemption . Where 's he going ? Doc , don 't go in there ! John ! Um , o-okay . Could ... Sit tight . Could you take this ? You 've got to be kidding me . - John , come on . - Shit ! He 's alone with that snake , Kristin . - Come on ! It 's gonna blow ! - John ! - Take the snake ! Take the snake ! - Come on ! Good work . - Get in the car ! What kind of Wheaties does this thing eat ? All right , plan B. This thing survived a plane crash and major explosives . It won 't burn . Can 't shoot it . Any suggestions ? The plating plant ! The acid ! Think we could dump this thing in one of those tanks ? Got any eights ? - Go fýsh . - Do you even know how to play this game ? Go fýsh . - What the hell are you doing ? - No time to explain , Bri . - Let 's just say there 's this little ... - " Little " ? Big thing after us ; actually , after the whole town . What are you talking about ? That . - What is that thing ? - Show them where the winch controls are ! - What for ? - Just show me ! Go , go , go , go ! - I 'll bring it to you . - No , you risked your life last time . I 'll do it . Nah , it 's okay . I 'm getting the hang of this thing now . All 's I gotta do is get its attention fýrst . Like this . Got your attention ? Go , go ! The controls are right there . Grab that . - What do we do ? - Get a wrench ! Okay . Hurry up , hurry up . Come on , come on . It 's good ! - Hit it ! - Okay ! Let 's go ! Psst , hey . Where is it ? What happened ? Like you said , I got his attention . # I canchangetheworld Yeah # # I can change the world # # Ha ! Checkmate , you sorry son of a bitch . You used the Spassky maneuver at the end there . Next time I 'll be prepared and use the Fischer countermove . - Very well . - Jeez , you guys , what 's it been , six hours ? Get a life . Especially when being hunted by a giant reptile with bad breath , this is the one for you . From now on ... you can call me Special Agent Larson . - You got in ? - I got in . Great . The F.B.I. ' s gonna be proud to have you . Maybe helping kill a giant acid-spitting snake pulled some strings at Quantico . - We 're gonna miss you down here . - I 'm gonna miss you guys too . It 's time I went out and tried to fýgure out some of the things you did . - Besides , it 's getting a little crowded around here . - Tell me about it . We 've been swamped since opening day . A man in your condition should not be drinking . Congratulations , stud boy . What ? We 're pregnant . I 'm gonna have a baby . I 'm gonna have a baby ! # I can change the world # # Yeah # # I can change the world Yeah # # I can change the world # # I can change the world Yeah # # I can change the world # # Yeah # # I can change the world # # World , yeah # # She don 't like me thinking that # # I can feel the way I do # # She don 't like to make up her mind # # She wants what 's best for you # # Time goes by # # Now I find I ain 't got that much to say # # Never take my love away # # Carry me # # Walk beside me while we grow old # # Lift my soul and always carry me # # Can you still need a reason # # Just an easy way out # # With not much left to believe in # # I wonder what all the talk 's about # # Whoa-oh-oh-oh # # Whoa # # Carry me # # Walk beside me while we grow old # # Lift my soul and always carry me # # Carry me Carry me # # Carry me # # Walk beside me while we grow old # # Lift my soul and always carry me #

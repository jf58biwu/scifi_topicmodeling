 Leave me alone ! Previously on Farscape ... You are not going to die ... The only treatment is a tissue graft from a genetically compatible donor ... Gilina ... If a warrior cannot die in battle , she can at least die alone . One dose , some bedrest ... This may help stabilise you until Crichton returns with a cure ... I am Scorpius ... What the hell was that ? A memory ... Our spy ... has an interest in wormhole technology ... and you can have Crichton ... when I have finished with him . We 've got to get you out of there . Get the sample back to Moya . Does Aeryn mean that much to him ? Crichton is in love with you . Crichton succeeded . Where is he ? I want to see him . My side , your side ! My side , your side ! Danger , Will Robinson ... Beware the chair ... THE HIDDEN MEMORY Why the yotz are we still here ? The Prowler 's on board , isn 't it ? We should Starburst away from here before Crais finds out where we are . We can 't ... starburst is not available ... nor is propulsion ... We will be fortunate just to maintain orbit . But Pilot , I thought Moya was prepared for one more Starburst ? She was , but no longer . She has gone into what appears to be full labour . She chooses now to go into labour ? It 's a little inconvenient . She has little choice and she is very frightened . Pilot , that 's a natural reaction during the birthing cycle . Moya tells me that this is not a natural birthing cycle ... She 's now certain that ... there 's wrong with her child It is not a normal Leviathan . How are you feeling ? - Better . - Lie back down ... it may be some time before your strength returns completely . I hear I have you to thank for my life . Yeah ! .. Oh , and the other one . - What other one ? - Gilina . - Don 't you remember her ? - We met on the Zelbinion . - Where 's Crichton ? - You should rest now , Aeryn . - Where is he ? - Crichton 's still on the Gammak base ... He 's been captured by the Peacekeepers . They 're probing his mind using something called an Aurora Chair . Why didn 't anyone tell me ? Why haven 't you gone after him ? There are hundreds of Peacekeepers down there . I could not infiltrate that base without being detected . I can . - Don 't try to stop me , D 'Argo . - I won 't . I 'm strong enough to go alone . No , you 're not ... I 'm coming with you . If you can be an idiot , I can be an idiot . A warrior may be of some use to me down there but Zhaan , why don 't you stay here ? John might need me , if he gets damaged by the Chair , I can help him . I 'm hoping Crichton will be strong enough to fight the Chair . - Flight recorder getting all this ? - What do you call this ? Slingshot ! Holy mother , it 's a wormhole ! There 's no use resisting , Crichton ! The chair will rip the memories from you , even if you fight it ! I am not ... resisting . The chair says he is holding something back . Then increase the extraction ! Show us what you 're blocking ! I 'm not ... blocking . Come on , baby . About wormholes . - What are you doing there ? - Don 't talk to me ! Stay ! You stay where you are ! Don 't talk to me ! No talking to me ! I do my talking in the Chair . Do you like the chair ? Love the Chair . Love the Chair . Love the Chair . Are you spying on me , Stark ? Scorpy , sent you in here to spy on me ? No , I 'm no spy for Scorpy . - What you got there ? - Nothing . Nothing . What is it ? Stop ! If you don 't stop , I 'm going to have to kill you . Give it a couple of days ... Scorpy and Peacekeeper Barbie 'll do it for you . You 're not crazy . - Are you , Stark ? - No ... but if they think I am , they don 't bother me so much . So whatch a hiding there ? My baby . It 's a magnetic crypt encoder . I made it from scraps of metal I 've been collecting for two cycles . What 's it do ? If I get the sequence right , it can unlock the door . but I can only try one sequence at a time . You 're going to be here forever , if you 're waiting for that thing to get you out . At least I 'm trying something . Trash ! You 'll tell them about my baby ? No ... No , I 've kept things from them this far . I can keep this . Everyone can block thoughts for a while , Crichton , but eventually ... you 'll tell the Chair . I 'm the only one who can block thoughts forever . How many times have you been in it ? Over 100 sessions . Well , what is it ? What 's so important that you can keep it from the chair ? What do you know ? Nothin ' ... I 'm tellin ' ' em the truth . What I 'm blocking , has nothing to do with the wormholes ! - Are you alright ? - I 'm fine . Any sign they 've spotted us , D 'Argo ? Nothing 's tracking . - The scanning blind seems to be holding - Let 's hope so . - What about when we land ? - There won 't be any sensors up top They would give away that there 's a Gammak base underground . John ! - Who 's there ? - John ... John ? - Where 's that voice coming from ? - Shut up ! Don 't say a word . - Gilina ? - John . Keep your back to the camera . - They can see but they can 't hear you . - I remember , I remember . Did you get that paraphoral tissue to Aeryn ? Chiana got it off the base , but I don 't know if she made it back to Moya in time . Who is there , who 're you talking to ? It 's a friend , she can help get us out of here . Now we both have a secret to keep . Gilina , I need , some help . I need you to get ' em off my back for a while . I 'll think of something . John , don 't worry . I 've gotta go now , I can 't stay tapped in for long . Thanks . Moya 's data stores indicate it may be best to get , the offspring out as fast as possible . - How the yotz can we do that ? - It says we can try blasting the trannix , with coolant from Moya 's thermal chamber . Then do it ! I want this thing over with , I want to be , still . Rygel ! You 've got to stay calm during the birth . I am calm , I ... I 've conceived hundreds of progeny . - Those are only the official ones with my wives . - Then , you should know something about this . - You should be able to help us . - I was never present at the birth . - Not one ? - Well of course not ! I think this is a trifle different , don 't you ? ... My progeny were tiny . Tiny and handsome , like their father . Okay , I 'm patched in here ... Try it again ! Hurry up ! .. Scorpius wants maximum power now . We just have to reroute the annex cable , we 're onto it . - Alex , you need some help ? - Hi Gilina . Yeah , you 're not wrong . If you put the double cabling online , I can finish patching in . Sure , alright then ... You know all this better than me . Thanks . Status report ! We 're back online ? Checking power levels now , just a few microts . Good . - Are we ready ? - All levels are go . Calibration complete ? The Chair is ready , Scorpius . Good . Follow us . John ! Gilina ... I can 't talk right now . Looks like we got company . John , when you get into the chair , just remember one thing . - What ? - Remember when we kissed on the Zelbinion ? - No , no , that 's the thing I 'm blocking . - Trust me . - I do trust you . - Then remember the kiss . - Scorpy ... - Get back inside Stark ! - Get inside ! - Scorpy ... Scorpy , let me get into the Chair ! - Have you finished ? - Yes . You see , Crichton ... this is what I 'm trying to keep you from . Yeah , Scorpy , you 're all heart . You show me everything that 's in your brain ... and I won 't torture you anymore . - I 've shown you everything . - The Chair indicates you 're holding something . Chair 's wrong . What won 't you tell me ? I already know everything else . I know you 're living on a stolen Leviathan with escaped prisoners , and I know that Leviathan is pregnant . You know who the Daddy is ? Why are you doing this to yourself ? What is so important ... that you 're willing to go through all of this ? I 'm not blocking anything . Bring him . I 'm going to enjoy ripping the truth out of you , Crichton . Commander Crichton ... it 's good to see you 're enjoying your stay with us . Crais , don 't you ever knock ? Stop ! What is that ? My question as well , Captain . - What do you want ? - I 'm here to thank you . Yeah ? ... For what ? I 've never been one of the elite ... Did you know that ? My parents were common farmers ... I was shanghaied from their commune as a young boy . I rose through Peacekeeper ranks on my wits , and my hatred , but still , some doors were always closed to me . Thanks for the family tree , Crais , but frankly , I don 't give a damn . With this wormhole information you 've given me , I now have the power to rise where I should be . You can 't make things up for the chair , Captain . You know that . What is that ? I don 't know . I know it looks like an episode of Melrose Place . - What do you mean , you don 't know what it is ? - I don 't know . Damn ! What is it ? Is that it , Crais ? - Is the game up ? - What ? Crais ... first found out about wormholes when I came through . I gave him the information disk in exchange for my life . It 's a lie ! No , it 's not a lie . He 's lying ! Damn you , Crichton ! Tell him the truth ! So , nothing of what we saw was true ? - No . - Were you born on a farming commune ? - Yes . - Were you conscripted by the Peacekeepers ? - Yes , but ... - How does Crichton know this ? - Well , he must have stolen it from a database . - While he was in security 3 containment ? Look , I don 't know how he did it , but what you saw on there is not true . Of course it 's not . There 's only one way to be sure it is a lie . How ? For you to go in the chair . - Me ? - Yes . No captain , has ever been subjected to such an indignity . There 's always a first for everything . Get Crichton back to his cell . You overstep yourself , Scorpius . You haven 't got the numbers to put me in the Chair . Don 't I ? I commend your loyalty ... It must be difficult to maintain for an officer like Crais ... an officer on the edge , and out of control . Talk to me , Scorpius , not to them ! I have unconditional authority on a Gammak base . Captain Crais , will go to the Chair . To stop that , you will have to kill me ... and all my men . Are you prepared to do that ? Do not listen to him , that is an order ! Do what you know if it 's the right thing . Put Crais in the Chair . That 's the last of the gear from the transport pod . What are you doing with those explosives ? I 'm upgrading these primitive things . I 've found an access shaft , I should be able to get down to the base and look for Crichton . - Are you strong enough ? - I 'd better be . Stop . I don 't know how she did it ... but she did it . Rest , Crichton . No , no , we 've got to do something . I gotta get that door open . What is that ? What did you just show me ? I 'm able to give a few thoughts , that 's all . Rest , my friend . - How long have you been here ? - Two cycles . Peacekeepers killed most of my people , but they kept me alive because I interest them . I 'm able to hide thoughts that their chair can 't touch . It 's almost ironic . What made me a slave now keeps me alive . What made you a slave ? This ... I 'm of the Bannak slave race . Outsiders think that we do not feel ... but it is only that our feelings don 't always show . Just as this , can hide our feelings , we are also able to cloud thoughts from our minds . What I know deep inside ... Peacekeepers will never see . - End this now ! - I did everything I could to avoid it ... The recruiter is here to pick you up ... - I 'm counting on you to protect him ... - Do you understand ? Who is that ? That 's ... my ... father . Turn it off ! Don 't you like your past , Crais ? Turn it off ! Can 't you get to what he knows about wormholes ? No , he 's fighting it . I don 't know anything ! Sir . Is there civilians inside this cell ? No . Aeryn ? Chiana told me what you did for me ... thank you . What are you doing here ? Paraphoral tissue takes at least ten solar days ... I don 't have ten days , I need to know where Crichton is . They have him on level nine containment . There is no way of reaching him without a direct order from Scorpius . John is blocking a memory from them . Scorpius thinks it has something to do with his precious wormholes , but it doesn 't . What does it have to do with ? Me ... he 's protecting me ... but as soon as Scorpius finds out that he knows nothing about wormholes ... he 'll kill him . We 'll need more rocks if we 're going to hide the rest of these , D 'Argo . If the Peacekeepers come up through the level rises , this is where they 'll surface . I hope those things work , otherwise there 's not much to stand between us and them . I always wanted to ask you , D 'Argo ... That Qualtar blade , for a warrior , it seems a very unconventional weapon . Many cycles ago , there was a race even more feared than the Peacekeepers ... The Teloks . They laid siege to my planet for over one hundred solar days . When the final assault came , all our warriors had were these weapons . My own great grandfather died in that war . When the final days come , Luxans believe that the Qualtar blade , will lead us to freedom . I understand , D 'Argo , please forgive my curiosity . There is another thing we can do for you . What ? My Qualtar blade and I , can cut stones for you . Look , I 'm not going to say this again , there is nothing in there . I 'm just telling you what I picked up from Crais 's carrier . - What 's going on ? - Shhh ! It detected an unauthorised magnetic pulse coming from somewhere on this level . There is no signal coming from in there . Look ! I 'll prove it to you . See ? Nothing , absolutely nothing . - What the frell is that ? - Obviously nothing . Get out of it , Stark . How could you ? How could you ? You were right , we 'll move him to another cell . - No need to be moved . - Why not ? Because they 're coming with me . Who is she ? That is ... The Radiant Aeryn Sun . How many Peacekeepers do you know on this base ? - Are you alright , Crichton ? - Yeah . - How 're you doin ' ? - I 'm better now . - Come on , we 'd better go ! - Sorry . ... and no one outside this chamber knows of the Admiral 's orders . I saw to that , Sir . So now I know why you tried to fight the Chair . - Are there any more barriers ? - No , that 's what he was fighting to hold . - And what Crichton saw about wormholes ? - Is not in this captain 's memory . Security breach ... - This is Scorpius ... - Sir , the human prisoner has escaped . - How ? - There 's a Peacekeeper working with him . Seal the base ! Everything ! He must not reach the surface . It 's clear ! Come on ! Go , go ! You first ! Peacekeepers . Come on , just go ! Come on ! Come on ! In here . Keep searching . Oh , no ! What do you mean , " oh no " ? To give birth , Moya must equalise pressure with her outside environment . You mean ... you mean with space ? What , Moya has to make a vacuum into here ? - Yes , I can 't stop her . - How much time do we have ? I don 't know , maybe , 18 microts . 18 microts ... Where do we go ? - My den 's safe . - That 's very lucky for you isn 't it , producto ? We can 't get to you in 18 microts . There are pressure tanks in maintenance bay 6 , I suggest you go . Go now . It 's locked ! Pilot , it 's locked ! - Yes it is , my dear , there 's plenty of room in here . - I 'm not getting in there . That 's all there is ! Get inside ! You only have 10 microts . Any other ways off the base ? They 're sealing all the access shafts , means they 're shutting everything . - There 's got to be some way out of here . - No way . Everything else , even the lock they just put on needs an ident chip from a senior officer . Alright , let 's go bag a senior officer . I 'll do it , Crichton . You stay with him . Excuse me , I 'm just making myself comfortable . What is that ? What ? That ! Oh , it 's nothing . Where 's your hand , slug face ? It 's ... It 's down there . I know , keep it in your caftan , pal . Pilot ! - I 'm very busy now , Chiana , you two okay ? - How 's Moya ? Yes ... The offspring 's coming now . I can see it ! I must go Chiana . What was that ? Nothing ... just a bit of helium . - Helium ? - Yes , I ... I don 't like being in confined spaces . - I ... I get nervous . - You 're disgusting ! Captain Crais ... What are you doing in this chair ? Who 's that ? Who 's there ? I suppose I shouldn 't expect you to recognise my voice . Did Scorpius send you ? Release me , from this chair . Why ? ... So that you can kill me , the way that you killed Teeg ? Who are you ? I am irreversibly contaminated ... Now do you know who I am ? Aeryn ... Sun . - Does this contaminate you , Crais ? - As a Peacekeeper ... you took a blood oath , to obey your commanding officer , till death . - Yes . - I am still your commanding officer . - I am no longer a Peacekeeper . - You are a Peacekeeper for life . - On the oath you ... - Your oath means nothing , you made sure of that . - You destroyed everything , I lost everything ... - Aeryn , Sun ... You know what I learned away from you ? Everything I lost isn 't worth a damn and I don 't want to go back to your past . I ... order you ! You order me ? You will never order me again . I will track you down and kill you , Officer Sun . On that I give you my vow . You know what I give you , Crais ? Your life . I will make you watch ... your life . Where 's Aeryn ? ... She should be here by now . Do you want to be with her , Crichton ? What ? Do you want to be with Officer Sun ? Gilina , can we talk about this another time ? No , I don 't think we can . You want me to go with you , you want me to give up everything , so you must answer me . Do you want to be with her ? Only me , let 's go ! Aeryn , did you bag yourself a senior officer ? Ran into an old friend ... Let 's go . Let 's get out of here . Okay . - Come on . - Do you want to be with Crichton ? - I 'm sorry ? - He won 't answer my question , will you ? Gilina ... whatever the two of you have been discussing , it 's none of my business . Yes , it is ! He asked me to go with him , and I cannot do that , if he loves you . Gilina , you have to come with us , if you don 't come they will kill you . - I 'll be okay . - Gilina , you 've saved my life , and you know Peacekeepers , they will come and they will find you . I can take care of myself . You take care of John . - Gilina ! - Tell John . At least come and talk to him before ... They used a senior officer 's ident chip , they 're climbing the air vent to the surface . - I thought as much . - Do you want me to burn them out ? No , we need Crichton alive . We 'll take the level risers , and beat them to the surface . Let 's go ! Right . - Where 's Gilina ? - She 's not coming with us . What ? Aeryn , what 'd you say to her ? I didn 't say anything , she decided on her own . - I gotta go get her . - Crichton , we don 't have time for this . She has gone , it 's what she wants . Come on . Pilot ! Pilot , are we repressurised yet ? Yes , you can get out now . - Chiana , I didn 't mean to ... - Shut up ! Something 's still not right . A portion of the offspring , can 't get clear of Moya 's external vent . I 'm getting a closer visual now . - What is that ? - What ? What 's wrong ? The offspring ... look . - That 's Moya 's child ? - Yes . It 's covered in weapons . When d 'Argo broke the contraception wall half a cycle ago , the Peacekeeper catalyst he released , must have contained a DNA signature to produce weapons . - Will that grow as big as its mother ? - Possibly bigger . Will Moya control him , or the Peacekeepers ? I don 't know , there 's never been a Leviathan with weapons before . We have a more immediate problem , look . The birthing channel was not designed for this manner of offspring It cannot fly free . It is panicking and starting to charge its weapons . - Is he going to shoot his way out of Moya ? - I think so . - Can you force an atmosphere into that vent ? - Yes . - Yes , I think so . - Maybe ... I can climb down the internal shaft , and cut a seam so the child can get itself free . You 'd better hurry . It 's good to see you again . - Come on , they 're not far behind . - The transport pod is this way , let 's go . Keep your weapons ready . Let 's go ! Load weapons ! Aeryn , watch out ! Cover me , Aeryn ! Go ! What was the secret you were keeping hidden from Scorpius down there ? They thought it was about his doomsday device about wormholes . It wasn 't ... it was only about the time I kissed a girl . - Really ? - Yeah . Okay ... don 't shoot me baby Moya , just ... Nice and calm ... Nice and calm . What were you keeping from him ? Memories of places from when I was a boy . Must have been one hell of a place . - I can 't do it , Pilot ! - You have to . It won 't move ! Moya 's trying to control the offspring , but there 's weapon 's primed to fire . Then let it fire ! Tell her to let the gun fire at low blast level . - What ? - I know it 's crazy but it 's the only way . If we don 't get this child out , it 'll destroy Moya 's bulkhead . Go , Zhaan ! - Crichton ! - We 're coming ! Come on , let 's give them something to remember us by . Not yet ! Let me get out of here ! I can 't stop it ! Get out now ! Just get out ! Run Chiana ! Run ! - That was a low level blast ? - That did it ! The offspring 's free , it 's free . - How 's Moya ? - She 's okay , we 're okay . Not quite ... You 're not going with them . Shoot him , Gilina ! Shoot him ! Gilina ! Must get back to the transport pod , the firewall is dissipating . Before she left the Gammak base , Gilina scrambled the scanning data files . Even Crais 's Carrier can 't find us now , which is ... quite fortunate , because , we can 't Starburst with the offspring . We can 't move very far at all . Thankyou , Pilot ... How 's Gilina ? Not good . - What about Moya 's child ? - He 's okay . - He ? It 's a boy ? - Yes . A male ... excellent . What kind of a beast is he ? Just lie still and let Zhaan 's medicine do its work . You 'll be fine in a little while . No more lies , John . I 'm not lying , Gilina . - Why did you come back for us ? - I had to help you . Aeryn was right . If I 'd stayed there , they would have found out about me . Found out that ... I love you . Gilina . Zhaan ? May I help ? May I give you this ? It 's a place I once saw . I 've been carrying it with me for a very long time . It 's beautiful . There now . Just hold onto it , don 't let go . John . Yeah ? Do you think ... If things had been different ... that you could have loved me ? Yeah . Kiss me one more time . - Shhhh ... Don 't talk . - Kiss me .

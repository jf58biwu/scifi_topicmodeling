 Previously on Farscape ... And finally on Farscape . Your infantile obsession with betrayal is misplaced , John . Scorpius actually said that ? Can you believe , the son-of-a-bitch did actually say that ! Look past my actions , towards my goal ... our common goal . He leads Braca and a damn Command Carrier here and no , I have an infantile obsession with betrayal ! If you do initiate starburst , your ship will be crippled . If Scorpius is harmed in any way ... the Leviathan will be destroyed . We have Braca sitting on our front doorstep ... issuing threats with one hand and Scarran messages with the other but ... no , no , no , I 'm sorry , it 's not a betrayal . Do you believe them ? Yes ... no ... I ... maybe . I don 't know . Look , I can understand if you ... if you didn 't want to , but it is possible that they 're telling the truth , crazy as it sounds , that the message was intercepted from the decimated Scarran base on Katratzi . Our course is set for the wormhole that leads to Crichton 's home planet . Upon arrival , begin the process of subduing their defensive forces . - Just tell me the Scarrans don 't know where Earth is . - They 'll go ... Crystherium Utilia . An acquired taste . - Hummingbird feeder . - You know of our delicacy ? Bird of Paradise . Yah , Mom 's garden . Dime a dozen . Now they 're gonna go . They 're gonna go because I told them their flowers were there . That being the case , perhaps you should set aside how we feel about Scorpius and listen to what he 's proposing . No . Absolutely not . No . He ... he 's manipulated us , Aeryn . He manipulates everything . This ... us ... from the first moment we met , the man has done nothing but lie to us . I know , but what if the Scarrans are heading to Earth ? What if they really are ? What else did he say to you ? I assure you , I had nothing to do with this John . That said , reality reality presents opportunity , John . That if I ally myself with the Peacekeepers , he will see to it see to it that our entire might is thrown into defending your world ! - Well , that 's something you have to consider . - No , I don 't . I can destroy the wormhole . Seal up Earth . You can do that ? Yes ... no ... maybe again . The knowledge is there . It 's just not in the correct order . Alright , but what if they ... make it there before you ? What if they beat you there ? What happens to your family ? Everyone ? Make a decision , John . You have nothing to fear from this commitment . It 's a big commitment . Either one . So you 're ... - What ? - afraid ... Of commitment . Hey , wait a minute . Did she hesitate like that , or was that just you doing that now ? - What does it matter ? - Well , it matters because , if she hesitated like that , she knows you were talking about her . - You said what ? - What I said . Like you said ? - What does it matter ? Well , if you said it to him like you said it when you said it to me , then it means that he knows that you know . Now is not a good time ... to be ... talking ... commitment ... with Peacekeepers . Earth is not ready . Will they ever be ? One day ... maybe . - So you got out of it . - Ohh ! Please . No , really , because , uh ... if she paused like that ... I don 't wanta talk about it . So what do we do ? We hope . We hope that I can figure out how to destroy the wormhole . Otherwise all the bad things happen . And it 'll be my fault . Well , I 'm with you . Good job . Always position yourself so they have to come to you . Chiana ... this isn 't about us . Sure . - Ready ? - Yah . We 're natural allies , John . The Scarrans will ravage your planet , and I can prevent it . Miss Britannica ... what kind of Scarran ship is following us ? A Stryker , John . Swift attack . - It 's gonna beat us to the wormhole ? - Utilizing starburst ? ... possibly . What about ... Braca and the Queen Mary ? No . Grasshopper ... tell me your plan for saving Earth . By a simple declaration of alliance . Even infuriated , Emperor Staleek will be forced to stay his attack ... or , by its inception , incur a war that he is still afraid of losing . Your timing is terrible . It 's too late . Welcome ... to the nuclear age . John ... see reason . No , I am no longer a chess piece . Crichton , he is not wrong . You must trust him . Goldilocks ... it 's a bad choice . When you figure that out , call our one-eight-hundred number for counseling . Okay Chiana . Lock down the maintenance bay . - Good riddance . - You two better grab your helmets . Captain Braca ... here 's the deal . We 've attached a bomb to Scorpius and we 're leaving . Follow us , and the bomb explodes . Once we 've gone , the bomb will shut down . Couldn 't be simpler . Don 't bother responding . We 're not listening . Explain to me the logic of resisting the Scarrans without allies ! I see . Reason has fled them all . So much you misunderstand about me , John . Your actions ... put your world at risk . I did this . I 'll fix it ... and live with it , either way . Weak species ! John ... reconsider . Otherwise you doom Earth ... to destruction ! Subtitles : PK SUB-66 " Bad Timing " Why send a Stryker force to Earth ? For impotent revenge against Crichton ? Or to seperate me from my lover ? We are political enemies , you and I , but Scarrans both . Do you have the fortitude to ally yourself for a greater good ... than your own advancement ? You destroyed my father . Our political office , the bounty of our rank , was stolen . Just as he took from his predecessor . You must put that aside . What does it matter ? The hierarchy shall judge us both ... harshly . The Crystherium Matriarch is gone . This region of the galaxy ... denied to us . A partnership . Your lover , Pennoch ... travels to Earth , Ahkna ... because these grow there . John , at this range , Pilot could still contact Scorpius , - but after one more starburst , he ... - No turning back . I think you should concentrate on your training with Katoya . Katoya was a frelling fruitloop . Focus on your inner strength . It 's here . I just can 't find the Rosetta Stone . - Katoya . - Fruitloop . - Sex . - Chiana ! - Sex does it . - For you . For everyone ... sex . - With you , or with him ? - Well , whatever . Sex ... John . This is hard to say , but , uh ... not all of the Peacekeepers are represented by Grayza 's betrayal . If you make a pact with Scorpius , I believe they 'll honor it . And then they will enslave your planet . Thanks . It 's not twelve . It 's not ... twelve ! Pilot ... how come we haven 't starburst ? We need Starbust ! Scarran Stryker craft have a unique propulsion system ... - that allows them to cover great distances . - And ... ? We required three additional starbursts to reach the destination . At our current rate , they will arrive before us . Moya and I have discussed the options ... and elect to employ an extended starburst technique . Extended starburst ... You look awful . Can 't think . Ohh , this extended starburst is much worse than Pilot expected . Rygel is vomiting continuously , though perhaps that 's not so unusual . On the other hand , Stark has passed out which is just as well ... cause now he can 't vomit at all . Would you leave me alone for a while ? Momentarily . Chew . No , thank you . It decreases the symptoms . How fares the wormhole ? Can you close one down ? - Noranti , would you leave us , please ? - I know of one sure curative for brain lock . - Natural ... organic ... drugs . - Come on ... please . - How is your nausea , dear ? - Better , thank you . Good . I can take a hint . I was looking for you in the maintenance bay . I liked your solution . Liked that , did 'ja ? You have any home remedies for writer 's block ? I know you better than that . I 'm gonna fail . It 's a sin , really . I 'm close . There 's just not enough time . It 's always about time . Yah ! Time . Timing . Timing ! I love you . Don 't ever change . Pilot ... - proof me on this . - If I can . Remember , I 'm a bit woozy myself from extended starburst . I 'll have Grandma whip ya up somethin . A wormhole is a disturbance in space-time . Immediately before it opens ... a pressure bubble forms . You can 't see it , but it 's there . I can see it . - You can see the bubble ? - Yes , can 't you ? I kinda smell it . Anyway ... anyway , you know what I 'm talkin about . The bubble starts tiny , and it expands outward . When the bubble bursts , the wormhole opens . Correct . Alright ... here 's my theory . Stop me if you 've heard it before . I travel down the wormhole to Earth in my module . The wormhole closes behind me ... I wait . Before the wormhole opens , I dive in at the last moment , piercing the bubble . That collapses the wormhole in around me , over and over and over again , all the way back to here . The wormhole is sealed up forever . Closed ... Finito . Road gone . That ... is ... brilliant , Commander ! - It 'll work . - The math is impeccable . The quantical relationships line up perfectly . Am I sensing a problem ? The Scarrans are on their way , Pilot . The timing required to puncture the bubble at its maximum radius , thereby beginning the chain-reaction you describe , is in the mili-microts . So I can 't do it . Even if you could see the bubble , your eye-limb coordination is lacking . I 'm not going to ask you another favor . So I 'm just gonna beg . Commander ... I 'm ... sorry . There 's nothing I can do . Outstanding , Pilot . My congratulations to you and to Moya . No sign of the Scarrans . We beat ' em . I 'm coming with you . Aeryn , we got one shot at the wormhole before the Scarrans arrive . Pilot 's explained this manuver to me . He 's not very optimistic . If it doesn 't work ... we could be stuck on Earth . There are worse places . Not if the Scarrans get there . Then we 'll have to do the best we can . What did you imagine ... for your life ? Service , promotion , retirement , death . You ? This is exactly what I imagined . And a couple of kids . Ahh ... Dominar . You should do it . Would you ? No . But I 'm ... not you . Allow me to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am to have you back on board , Sir . Delightful to be here , Captain . Is Commandant Grayza not joining us ? No ... no , she 's having ... a little difficulty adjusting to her confinement . Apparently she 's under sedation . Pity . Next time we encounter Crichton , see to it that the older cook is brought aboard ... unharmed . Do you wish me to continue to track his movements and pursue him ? Unnecessary . I believe ... that our reluctant human may soon return ... of his own volition . My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut . Four years ago , I got ... shot through a wormhole ... to a distant part of the galaxy . I ended up on this ship ... this living ship ... populated by escaping prisoners ... who became my friends . Curious holiday , Easter . Religious leader dies ... comes back from the dead , and you end up celebrating like this ! - I made enemies ... - John ... Not now , you son-of-a-bitch ! This ... is ... not ... time ... to be ... messing ... with ... me ! You want me to fail , don 't ya ? Quite the contrary , John . Should your planet fall victim ... I would not wish to reside in the head that blames itself . You 're lying . I 've examined this thoroughly from my ... unique perspective , and I believe ... your fears are correct . I believe ... you will fail . After all that 's happened , how do you expect me to trust you ? Well ... I think that ... like religion ... it 's an individual choice . Either you believe and , therefore , bunnies are unnecessary ... or ... you don 't , in which case ... chocolate ? Hey ... Crichton ? What 're ya doin ? Contacting Scorpius . Change of plan . John ... What ? Gonna see if I can cut a deal before the Scarrans get here and avert a massacre . Are you really sure this is what you wanta do ? I can 't risk Earth . What the hell is the matter with these consoles ? Why are you doin this ? Why would you sell your own people out ? Because I am proud to bring Peackeeper protection to my backward ass little planet . Then don 't do it ! Pop the frelling bubble . Make the wormhole collapse . - Pip , I can 't do it . - Yes you can . - I 'm not smart enough ... - Yes you can . I 'm not fast enough , I am not alien enough . And you know what ? There are people in the Universe who don 't like me ! - I 'm only human . - Frell you ! To ... victory over Scarran domination . To you ... for your bravery . For resisting the enemy ? For not resisting ... your friends . Calm down , Pilot . Breathe . That 's it . Now , tell me what the matter is . Moya ... and I ... have never been at greater odds . We 've never disagreed ... so fiercely . Over what , Pilot ? I ... haven 't been entirely honest about not being able to help Crichton . You ! Sparky ... you selfish , egotistical , self-centered little Dominar . Pilot said it was you that turned him around . Do you want to pay me back ? We 'll see how it turns out . I love your scaly green ass no matter what ! Moya is enormously distressed by what we are about to do . Tell her she must be brave . It 's for the good of the family . Pilot ... how 's this gonna work ? Because the transport pods are built of Moya 's own elements , I will be able to live in one for up to an arn . But ... if we 're not rejoined by then , both wounds will scab over and our ... neurological connections will have no chance of regenerating . We 're gonna be quick . We go ... wormhole closes ... we wait ... before it opens again , we pop up the bubble and we 're back home . If not ... my death is assured . And ... without Moya ... I shall ... die alone . You won 't be alone , Moya . He shall return . And I 'm here . We 're all here . This will help you to relax . Most life-sustaining systems are on manual bypass . Ready as can be . Then do it , if you 're going to do it . Cap 'n ? Pip ? Okay , Pilot ... I really need to hear this from you . Captain D 'Argo , I remand the ship to your control . You may now ... cut me free of Moya . It 's not working ! Stop ! It 's not working ! Stop ! Stop ! What ? - What 's wrong ? - He can 't take anymore . He 's getting delirious . Well , what do you expect ? We 're cutting him in half . Oh , no . Not Pilot . The other one . Listen . It 's too much ... too fast ... it makes no sense ... I can 't remember ... Mine . There 's too much ... impossible pattern ... too much ... helpless ... help me ... Stark ! What ... is the matter ? It 's too much ... too fast . - Okay , right . - Chiana ... these command sequences must be performed while I am separated from Moya . Without them , most regulatory systems will fail . Okay ... you said ... you said you flew Talyn . Ohh ... I did . There . Sat there ... flew Talyn ... controled Talyn ... was Talyn . - S ... so ? - This way is more complicated . Four arms ... it 's too fast ... too much . Okay , Pilot . - Can you slow it down for 'em ? - There is no time . Alright . Show me and I 'll slow it down . Your eyes ... what did you do ? Your job . I 'm blind . Tell Crichton we 're ready . Thank you ... Chiana . They 're putting Pilot inside the transport pod . He doesn 't look well . I have fortified him ... with anti-infectious ointment and pain relief . Though I fear both to be wholly inadequate in this case . - What is this dren ? - Keeps the neural circuits moist ... til Moya and Pilot are rejoined . Don 't hold your breath . This isn 't even one you could get odds on . This moisturizing agent won 't work for long . The ganglia is already drying out . The wormhole cycle 's going to start in about 30 microts . You might want to grab onto something . John ... Aeryn ... the Scarrans are less than an arn away . Good luck . Dear God ... don 't let me screw this up . Ahh , Dad ! You sentimental son-of-a-bitch . Pilot ? We 're gonna to need you to wake up now . We need your help . Come on , John . There is no way ... that five hundred egghead scientists are strappin on a handgun as part of their uniform . So , help me out here , Winters . Make all this crap go away . I 'm comin . - Hello . - Hey , Dad . John ... where are you ? Serenity Base . - Serenity Base ? - Yah , the moon . Why didn 't you make Earth orbit ? Murphy ... Dad . We 've got a little problem . Worse than a three-hundred dollar clipboard that you can put paper in when it 's upside down ? Yes . The Scarrans have located Earth . And , they 're on their way . - What can we do ? - Nothing . I gotta do it . What the hell does that mean ? Why do you have to do it ? You 've already done enough , Son . I 'm going to seal up the wormhole . That 'll isolate Earth , but it should protect it . Then how do we get into deep space ? The old-fashioned way . You 'll build a rocket . I 've left you ... technology and navigation information ... here at your flagpole . How long do we have ? Not long . Then take me with you . Take us all ... we 're ready . Five hundred of the World 's best . We can help . There 's no time . What do you mean , there 's no time ? For Moya to get from the Moon to the Earth , what 's it take ? A blink of the eye ? Two seconds ? Come on , Son ! We 're down to minutes ... Dad . How do you want to spend ' em ? Son ... listen ... th ... the Secretary General of the UN ... he speaks for the planet on all space matters now . We 're startin to come together , just like you wanted . That 's good . Keep that up . I was lookin forward to coming with you , boy . Well ... sometimes things don 't happen quite the way you imagine ' em . Come on ... Tell Susan and Liv that ... I love ' em . And , I 'll contact ya if I can . Tell everyone . I will , Son . You tell my grandkids about me . That 's a no-brainer . They gotta know who my hero is . You 're gonna find when you have your own , you want ' em to pass you . Be better , climb higher . I guess if that 's the measure , I 'm ... the greatest dad on Earth . I love you , Dad . You 're the heart and soul of my life , Son . I love you . Good-bye . Stark ... can we move the ship ? Moya seems too dazed to respond to anyone but Pilot for navigation . - D 'Argo ... - The Scarrans will be here momentarily . No , no . Scarrans ... Scarrans torture ! Scarrans kill ! Torture , kill ! Torture , kill ! Stark ! I think I 'm okay now . Emperor Staleek ... the wormhole has reappeared as we approach . Scans show Crichton 's Leviathan sits nearby , though it makes no attempt to flee or defend itself . Ignore them . Continue on to Earth . Fulfill your mission . They 're here . Everyone brace ! I have crippled their ship . Up , Pilot . Now . Come on , Pilot . Up and at ' em . You 've got billions of lives to save . - Did I ... did I miss it ? - No . - Did I let you down ? - No , you did not . All right , listen up . - Right there . - Where ? - Right ... there . It 's gonna be a wormhole back to Moya and just pop the bubble when it 's ... - when it 's time . - At its apex . Yes , Commander . You know what scares the hell outta me ? From the first moment I laid eyes on you ... I could never see the end . What scares me ... is I always could . - Alright , Pilot . Time it right . - I see it , Commander . The bubble preceding your wormhole is forming now . Beginning acceleration sequence . Wormhole in quatro ... tres ... dos ... please ... work . Now ! - The wormhole is collapsing , I think this is gonna work . - Scarrans ! Disengage ! Disengage ! Son of a bitch ! Emperor ... Crichton has turned the wormhole against us . We will not survive ... Damn baby , we 're alive . You did a good thing today , Pilot , for which the goddess always rewards . - Float on memories , and time will heal your wounds . - Empty ! And should you ever need to leave again , - don 't hesitate in calling on me . - discharge ... I was your worthy successor . I was ! You ask Moya . When the Scarran shot her , I seized control and saved the ship ! I know you 're proud ... Troubled Stykera ... float on memories ... and perhaps time will heal your wounds . Discharge ... - pumps ... - Head down . Discharge ... Yes , yes , Pilot . D 'Argo has switched on the discharge pumps . Any water seepage will be expelled . Thank you . Now ... allow the minerals in Qujaga 's sea to soothe Moya , and you rest ... and regenerate your connection to her . How many fingers ? Tralk ! It 's not gonna go away . I 'm gonna be blind forever . Frell ! Hey ... that Diagnosan that we found near here , that is the first stop that we make when this is over . I promise . Simpletons ... What ? What 's going on ? Crichton 's got Aeryn in a boat . What 's he doin ? We have ... some unfinished business . Yes ... we have . A year ago , we let ... a coin ... make our decisions for us . Not again . Call it ! Aeryn ... I have a question . Can I go first ? Yah . When I was on the Command Carrier , I went to see a surgeon . I was really worried about what the Scarrans did to me . The fetus has been released from its stasis . So , I 'm having a baby . You okay ? And the baby ? It 's yours . I just wanted to tell you . Hope it doesn 't change anything . Umm ... well , it changes everything . We 're gonna have ... a baby ! Yah ! Frell you ! We are gonna have ... A BABY ! Wha ... what 's goin on ? Now John seems very , very angry . We 're having a baby ! Sit down before you fall down . - Are you all right ? - Yah . Ohh ! - Are you happy ? - Yah ! What was your question ? Oh ... god . Umm ... Crichton 's gone down onto his knees . Why ? I think he 's hurt himself . Will you marry me ? Yes ... - What 's he doin ? - Uh ... the boat 's sinking . He 's ... putting some sort of ... looks like a ring on her finger . A ring ? Euh ... a ring . You frellnicks ! Didn 't you watch any of those ... those ... those ... those Earth movies ? Crichton just proposed . Proposed what ? Marriage . Marriage ? Idiot ! John ! Aeryn ! Get inside ! D 'Argo , do you know what it is ? I have no idea whatsoever . Just come back inside ! Give me a break ... we 're in a boat ! Tracker scouts were correct . One Leviathan , partially submerged . Two invaders have exited their ship . Request orders . Are they gonna make it ? D 'Argo ! - Do you have target acquisition ? - Positive . I scan no armaments . - Neutralize invaders for analysis . - Acknowledged . Neutralization run ... beginning . Hatch doors are open ... hurry up ! You and your timing ... I love you .

 COMPUTER : Security breach . Code RedAlert . All personnel to their stations . Security protocols are in place . Did our distress message get out ? Whoever they are , they 're good . They 're in the abandoned tunnels . How did they even know about them ? Take cover ! Arrgh ! Voice , we 've covered the area . No sign of disturbance . It 's probably nothing , Hel Thanks for checking . - False alarm . - That mean we 're off the clock ? - Oh , yeah ! - Helen . Identify yourself . Hel , do you know him ? - Hel ? Hel - what 's happening ? - It 's my father . I thought that Hel 's dad was dead . He is . Sarge , if her dad 's dead , then that 's a ghost . Helen , help them . Hel , I 'm not getting any bio-sensor readings . Who are you ? Hel , are you all right ? Report . Explosion . Blew out side wall of the shaft . That wasn 't there before . It 's a hidden level . WOMAN : Is there someone there ? - Sounds like we 've got wounded over there . WOMAN : Oh , help ! Help ! MAN : Help me ! Sarge , did you see ... ? Your bio-sensors could have been malfunctioning . Hel , it 's possible . You have to understand ... .. he couldn 't have survived that blast . Stay focused , Hel . I don 't know what or who you saw , but , for now , I need to begin search and rescue . MAN : Please ! We 're trapped ! - We 're moving in . 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth WOMAN : Oh , overhere ! MAN : Someone 's here ! Sarge , Cleo , over here ! Hey , it 's OK . WOMAN : Please , help me get up ! Are you OK ? Helen ! ls that you ? Catherine . I worked with your father - when he was here . - Excuse me ? Catherine , you said my father . It 's a miracle you 're here , Helen . But I ... - Voice , is this where you wanted us to come ? - Yes , Hel . I had lost contact , but had yet to receive an official distress message . - That woman said that my father ... Hel , please . I will tell you more . This is not the proper time . Please continue the mission at hand . This way . First we see a man who looks like Hel 's father , who calls her by name , and then we find out he used to work here ? That 's a classic textbook haunting . Cleo ! Enough ! Oh , right . This is the future , where everything is explained away by evil clones and high-density holograms , and ... A hologram wouldn 't show up on my sensor . But there was no detectable projection device . How do you explain that ? - See ? - Oh , Cleo , there ls an explanation for what we saw . Yes . Sometimes humans have the sixth sense , or ... or ... six sensors . All I 'm saying is keep an open mind to all possibilities , not just the hi-tech ones . Weird things happen . Help ! ls anyone out there ? - Hello ? - Yes , we 're here . Help ! Help us ! Get us out , please ! - Hel , help me with this . - Yeah . They blew up the backup hydraulics . Save your strength . - Is there another way in ? - I don 't think so . - What 's going on in there ? - We lost containment ! Please get us out ! We will , but we need to know what we 're dealing with first . Quaduranium-hydrogen mix . They came in contact during the attack . Sarge , tell me what you see . Stand back ! COMPUTER : Containment failure . Evacuate immediately . - They 're screwed . Can you tell me anything - abobot the blast ? - The explosion went off within the facility walls . - The security countermeasures held up , but ... But what , Hel ? Complete structural collapse isn 't far off . - And that static storm won 't stay calm for ever . - You think it 's calm in there ? Whoever set this explosion knew what they were doing . Understood . What do you understand , Voice ? Or is that something else you won 't tell me until the proper time ? Hel , you 're in a research faciliiy , leading a highly sensitive effort against the Bailies . Sensitive enough not to tell those of us on the front lines until it 's nearly too late . Trust that my withholding and disclosing ofinformation depends solely on when it best serves your safety and that of your team . And you must remember that my trust is something that you can 't afford to toy with . - Hel , what do you think ? - Best guess . How much time do they have ? Ten minutes , tops . OK , start cutting through . Help as many people as you can for as long as you can . - Where are you going ? - To look for more survivors and another way in . Stay back , Cleo . Wait ! Hey , stop ! Wait ! Hello ? Is anybody here ? MAN : Hey there , little girl . Hel , what 's happening ? He 's here , Voice . My father . Hel that 's not possible He 's dead Hel , listen to me . Argh ! Argh ! Hel ! Can you hear me ? Hel ! Say something ! - Cree ... gan ... - Ssh ! No , try not to speak , Hel . No , don 't move , Helen . You 'll disrupt the link . Hello again , Voice . Creegan . I should have known it was you . Thank you , Voice . That 's all I needed . Voice ! Creegan 's tracing you through my receptor ! - Don 't transmit ! - I 'm too brilliant for that , Voice . Shutting up won 't save you . My tracer will locate you in minutes . You did this , Creegan . You caused the explosion . And like clockwork , you dispatch Hel . Your A-No.1 foot soldier , who I knew could be lured away from the pack by tapping into that little obsessed part of her psyche . Daddy . Hey there , little girl . I won 't be home tonight . So , here 's hoping this gets to you before you head off to dreamland . I love you . I love you very much , Helen . I 'll see you soon . A gift from me to you , Hel . Argh ! That tremor was two seconds early . - Can we hurry it up ? - OK , I 'm hurrying ! - Is it me , or are those shakes getting shakier ? - It 's not you . Just stay calm ! We 're getting there ! MAN : OK ! Hurry ! It 's now a full containment breach . Forget this place collapsing . You have to reactivate the containment shield . Otherwise , you and everyone within a ten-level radius of here will be vaporised . Cleo , did you see someone ? - Sarge ! - I 'm fine . - Wha ... ? - What ? Say it ! That was Hel 's father . You can 't deny he just saved your life . He knew that plasma bolt would come through that door at that second . I 'll bet he just told you something you couldn 't have known without his help . Look , I don 't get this sixth sensor of yours , or how it told you that . We 've got to blast this out now . Come on , guys ! Hurry ! MAN : Not a moment too soon . Come on ! - Are you all right ? Cleo , get these people back to the shaft and find Hel fast . - I 've got something to take care of . - OK . Containment shield ... Come on , show me .

I almost have you , Voice . And when I do , the remains of the underworld , and the levels you and your precious little teams profess to protect , will all ... belong ... to me . Voice command , enable self-destruct . Hel - what are you doing ? - Yes , Hel , pray tell . The way I see it , I die , the receptor dies with me . No receptor , no Voice , no trace . Hel , is this the only option ? - Yes ! Hel , I find your sudden zest for death undeniably delicious . Hook right . It 's only a zest when you 're dying with me . Any more surprises and I won 't be responsible for my actions . Urgh ! - Keep tracing ! - Yes , Creegan . So , what do you think , Voice ? You really think the daughter of your most valued follower has it in her to end her own life ? Oh . The Voice hasn 't told you , huh , Hel ? You found that to be a recurring trait of hers lately ? The more she says , the less you know . Isn 't that really infuriating ? Yep , Dad and The Voice were really tight . Oh , Voice , if you could see her face ... I really got you thinking , don 't I , Hel ? You want so desperately to kill me . A big part of being alive has been to kill me . And now you realise I have something you need more than revenge . It 's all in here , Hel . Something your father couldn 't tell you . Something The Voice will never ... tell you ! Hel ! He 's about to compromise my location . He 's close - Oh , we 're close , aren 't we , Hel ? You want what I want , let 's sit down with The Voice and clear some things up , huh ? - Hel ! Reader ... abort self-destruct . That 's my Hel ! Hel , what are you doing ? - Redirect ... half-burst . This isn 't over . Argh ! Argh ! Give me that disk , Creegan ! I 'll see you again , Hel . Or will I ? COMPUTER : Containment breach . Two minutes to detonation . Helen . Come on , Helen . It 's time for you to go . COMPUTER : 53 seconds to detonation . Hel ? Hel ? Hel ! Where are you ? Hel ? Can you hear me ?

Thank you . Move on now , Helen . And don 't look back . Hel ! Hel ! Over here ! Cleo . - Are you OK ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Voice , your location is safe . And Creegan ? - He escaped , - but I have a feeling we 'll see him again . And , Hel , I 'm sorry for withholding information from you . Yeah . I wish I could believe that . Breach has been sealed . We 're not going to vaporise . - But we might get crushed ! - Let 's move ! Bye , Daddy . Next week : 110 Trial And Error

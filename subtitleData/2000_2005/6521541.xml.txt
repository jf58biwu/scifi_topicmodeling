 Pick up ! Pick up the phone ! Look , I don 't know what that bitch told you , but I 'm solid . She 's lying to you . Check her right-hand desk drawer . It 's all there - the whole story . Pick up , man ! Call him off and let 's talk about this , all right ? Give me a chance to explain . - Help me ! Somebody wants to kill me ! - Who wants to kill you ? - He 's out there ! - Hold up ! Hold on . Don 't do that , guy ! You calm down ... - We 've got to stop him ! - Who ? He 's out there ! We have to get him before he gets me ! - Hey , hey ! Hey ! Get off ! - Take him down , take him down ! No ! Let me up ! He 's gonna kill me ! Take it easy . Relax now . Settle down . No . This isn 't enough ! I 'm not safe in here ! Hey , buddy , you 've never been safer in your life , OK ? Just relax . He can get me in here ! - I 'll go call Social Services . - Right . It 's not enough ! He can get to me ! He ... They 've identified it as nine-millimetre pistol ammunition . Teflon coated , armour piercing . It 's a single round . He was shot . No doubt about that . So I assume the million-dollar question is how ? Yeah . What do we know about the victim ? Carlton Chase , age 39 . Well-to-do realtor , single , lived in the area all his life . Nothing but parking tickets on his record . Came tearing in last night saying someone was gonna kill him . - He was right . - Except I don 't see bullet holes in the walls . The round looks to have entered through the top of his head . Agents . Thanks for coming down so quick . - Al Triguero . - John Doggett . Agent Scully . I 'd appreciate any help you can give us . We got this much figured out so far . - Bullet came through the air vent . - Yeah , that 's how it 's looking . There 's a burr on this louvre here where the bullet passed through . You can barely see it , but it 's there . So I 'm thinking this is where the killer hid . He somehow got into this ventilation system , and from here he had a clear line of sight to shoot Chase below . Did anyone hear a gunshot ? Seems likely you 'd hear one . Even with a silencer , it 'd echo through the ductwork . What 's directly above this ? I don 't understand . How could someone make that shot from here ? They didn 't make it from here . - Can I use your pencil ? - Sure . Captain , we 're gonna need your crime scene investigators up here . You got it . - So , lucky shot ? - Very . But this victim stated that he was gonna be killed just moments before he was shot , which doesn 't sound lucky at all . I guess I can 't argue with that . - What you got there ? - The old Godfather trick . Wrap a towel around a pistol to muffle the sound . The killer was up here all right . So how in the hell did he make that shot ? There 's thermal-imaging technology which can pick up body heat through walls . - Maybe that 's what allowed him to aim . - We field-tested that in the Marines . It weighs close to 90 pounds , has to be cooled with liquid nitrogen . I can 't quite see somebody lugging it up that ladder we just climbed . Either way , the rooftop of a police station ? That 's a pretty ballsy place for a hit . ( beep ) ( Chase ) Pick up ! Pick up the phone ! Look , I don ' t know what that bitch told you , but I 'm solid . She 's lying to you . Check her right-hand desk drawer . It 's all there - the whole stOIy . Pick up ... What are you doing ? My ... printer cable is loose . And that 's more important than coffee ? - Any messages ? - No . The light 's blinking . Looks like a message to me . Are you gonna play it or what ? Stupid ain 't cute , Tammi . I don 't care what your mama says . ( beep ) ( man ) Yeah ... lgot , like , rats again . I need you to get them all this time . 1806 Brook Valley Turnpike . Last name Allesandiy . You 've been here before . - Dwight ? - Yeah , I got it . No . Did you hear the news this morning ? Carlton Chase ? | just thought it was pretty scary news . Try and get Randall on the phone . ( footsteps ) Randall ? Your brother wants to see you . Randall ? You avoiding me ? Tammi told you I wanted to talk to you , right ? You wanna tell me what happened last night ? Randall , I 'm not mad at you necessarily , but I need to know exactly what happened . Anytime you do something without telling me first , you could get us both into trouble . I saw him stealing . - Carlton stealing from me ? - Yeah . He was skimming . So , where 's the money that he was skimming ? You see , the thing of it is , Randall , you get the money , then you do your thing . It 's a simple equation . That 's what I 'm talking about when I say you need to talk to me first ! We 'll probably be OK . But in the future ... let 's keep the communication lines open . One hand talks to the other , right ? Here , I brought you a sandwich . Meat loaf the way you like it . Go ahead , take it . It 's got mayonnaise and ketchup . We going out tonight ? Police station 's less than a mile from here . Chase ran it on foot . He says that somebody was after him . This is probably where it all started . - Huh . - What 's that ? Chase did business with an exterminating company called AAA-1 Surekill . Sixjobs in one month . I know that 's a requirement of selling a house . Agent . It 's a .45 . The bullet that killed Chase at the police station was a nine millimetre . You know , Elvis used to do this to his hotel rooms . I think Carlton Chase did this . So who was he shooting at ? If it was someone in this room , he sure would 've hit ' em . Unless it was someone outside . - You got the cash ? - What 's this look like ? - Who the ... - Evening . - What ? You lost ? - Nope . I think this must be the place . - What , you a cop ? - Oh , hell , no . No , your secrets safe with me , fellas . But I will be taking that money off your hands and the dope . Oh , you 're funny . Nah , you know what ? Chris Rock is funny . And you ? You 're just dead . Cap his ass . Bang . ( Doggett ) Yeah , I got it . Nine millimetre . Sulphuric . No , I got it . All right . Thanks . So which kind of shooting was this : lucky , coincidental or some third alternative ? It 's precision marksmanship , that 's for sure . These holes line up perfectly with the three victims behind there , which tells me that the shooter was standing right here behind this wall . And consequently wouldn 't be able to see what the hell he 's aiming at . Unless he could see . The light our eyes can register is only one portion of the electromagnetic spectrum . Other wavelengths , from infrared to gamma , have other properties . X-rays , for instance , can pass through solid objects . Walls , for example . So , you 're saying this guy used some kind of x-ray machine . You 're not saying this guy has x-ray vision ? I 'm remarking that these wavelengths exist . And the only thing that is stopping us from seeing them , if you will , is the biochemical structure of our eyes . I 'm conjecturing that if this structure were somehow different , we 'd have the ability to see things that we don 't . Call in Clark Kent . OK , so you explain it . - I can 't , so I 'm sticking with what I do know . - Which is ? That this was a drug rip-off . Furthermore , it 's the fifth drug rip-off in this area in the past two months . Somebody 's making a living capping drug dealers . And how does a dead real-estate agent figure into that ? Well , that I don 't know ... yet . But I did find out one more thing . Sulphuryl fluoride . You got a moment to see me in my office ? Dwight , I need to get this to the bank . It can wait . Can 't you tell your brother to get some lunch or something at least ? He 's practically right outside the door . I 'll keep the noise level down , if you will . - ljust feel like he 's always watching me . - How 's he watching you now ? Hello ? - Anybody here ? - Yeah . Agents Doggett and Scully , FBI . Dwight Cooper . - What can I do for you ? - Mr Cooper , do you recognise these ? I don 't recognise much of anything except shapes . Tammi ! Tammi , come look at this for me . I got bad peepers . Legally blind since birth . This look familiar ? They 're ours . They 're last month 's billings for Mr Chase . Oh . Carlton . One of my best clients . I sent him a ham every Christmas till he finally told me he was a Jew . He was a nice guy . We found some evidence at a crime scene . A piece of fabric on which we found traces of a chemical . Sulphuryl fluoride . It 's an insecticide used only by licensed exterminators . Yeah , it 's good stuff . We use it , along with about 200 other outfits in central Mass . You 've done time , haven 't you ? Yeah , a long time ago . Now my brother and I are actually members of the Worcester Chamber of Commerce . - Anything else ? - Yeah . Why did Carlton Chase call this office 14 minutes before he was murdered ? 8.34pm. We found a call to your office billed on Mr Chase 's calling card . It was made from a payphone not far from where he was murdered . Wow . I don 't know what to tell you . We were all gone home by that time , and there wasn 't any message on our machine . All right . We 'll be in touch if we have any further questions . Tammi . What do you know about that ? About Carlton calling here ? He ... I guess he must have left a message . What did it say ? I didn 't hear it . I was reaching for the play button , and I hit the erase button by mistake . I should have told you. lwasjust afraid that I lost us some business maybe . Come here , baby . You know I can 't see worth a damn . I just want to have a look at your eyes . The eyes are the windows of the soul . They tell you everything you need to know about a person . So tell me . Are you lying ? No , Dwight . That 's all I needed to know . - Dwight Cooper , arrested in 1986 . - For grand theft auto . Right . How does a legally blind guy steal a car ? I assume that he had a partner who did the driving . That brother he mentioned - Randall Cooper . They were arrested together . Although Randall apparently didn 't serve much time . They share the same birthday . - They 're twins . - I hate twins . Twins never rat each other out . Maybe there 's someone in that office who will . Hey , Tammi . You 're here early . You know you accidentally left your car running ? You must have been in a real hurry to get in here and make the coffee . What you got there ? Can I see ? ( Doggett ) Dwight Cooper , FBI . Dwight Cooper , warrant to search . Have someone read it to you . What the hell are you looking for ? Evidence related to the murder of Carlton Chase , et al . What 's in the box ? You got me . What 's the combination ? I don 't remember . So much for the easy way . You owe me for that . I run a clean business . Nothing here will say othenNise . I wouldn 't be so sure . Can you explain these , Mr Cooper ? Mr Cooper , you want to tell me about these invoices ? OK , Randall . Let 's talk about your exterminating company . It 's just the three of you , right ? You and your brother and Tammi Peyton ? So how is it that your little company billed over $ 700,000 to Chase Realty last year ? $ 700,000 . That 's a lot of dead rats . I think that you and your brother and Carlton Chase were in a whole other business together . Man , I gotta get into the bug business . I had no idea you could make so much dough killing things that creep around behind walls . You are quite the entrepreneur . I 'm just a regular Joe , providing a public service . Randall ? I 'm just a regular Joe . Provide a public service . Is that what your brother just said to Agent Doggett ? You know why I said that , don 't you ? Because somehow ... you can see through that wall . You can see your brother behind me and you can read his lips . I don 't know what gives you the ability , but I know how you use it . You shoot drug dealers from places where they can 't see you , and then you and Dwight rob them . That 's how you make all that money , isn 't it ? No . We 're exterminators . Yeah . You certainly are . And talking to you now , I think that the whole thing is Dwight 's idea . It 's time to be your own man , Randall . It 's time to think for yourself . You tell them anything ? No , I said what you said . We got a problem . It needs to be taken care of . ljust keep the books . You keep the books on a lot of blood money going through that office . We 're supposed to believe you didn 't know ? The drug rip-offs , the murders ? I didn 't know about any of that . Dwight doesn 't tell me anything . | just book the cash receipts . I don 't ask where they 're from . I know not to ask . Look , here 's where | get confused , and I 'm hoping that you can help me out . Carlton Chase . We think Chase was Dwight 's fence . He sold the drugs your boss stole . Together , they had a good thing going . So why was Chase killed ? It seems like bad business . Unless the reason wasn 't business . Unless it was personal . Am I under arrest ? Tammi Peyton 's phone records . Found something interesting . Calls to Carlton Chase . All of ' em late night . What do you want to bet they weren 't discussing escrow accounts ? So Dwight Cooper learns something 's going on between his girlfriend and Carlton Chase . And he kills him . Or he orders him killed , assuming Randall 's the triggerman . - ( Scully ) Maybe not . - ( Doggett ) What do you mean ? ( Scully ) Maybe Dwight 's not the one who 's jealous . I know it was you . I still need help , Randall . I made a reservation for the three-o 'clock bus . You go wait for me . It 's right over there - the Big Sky Express . I 'll be back right after I get the money . I know you took that book to protect me from Dwight . I need my book , Randall . I can 't get my money without it . I 'll be back in half an hour , OK ? I 'll meet you by the bus . Randall . You know I 'm coming back . You saved me from Carlton . I owe you . Randall . I 'll meet you by the bus . Clothes are gone . Tammi left in a hurry . - Maybe she thought someone was after her . - lf someone 's after you , you don 't pack . - You think she planned to go ? - I do . The question is where ? - Who you calling ? - Whoever Tammi called last . ( male voice ) Welcome to Concordia Bus Lines . Our menu options have changed . For reservations , press one . - Tammi . - ( gasps ) Dwight ! Is this what you had in your little secret box ? Hm ? A safety-deposit key . Looks like you had a lot of my money in there . - Dwight . - Shut up and drive . Drive ! So this is how you did it , hmm ? You kept two sets of books . Huh . You 've been ripping me off for months . There 's $ 100,000 difference here . Explains why you were in a hurry the other morning . - Dwight . - Shut up ! Randall should 've killed you , not Chase . Or maybe you and Carlton were working together ? It wasn 't like that . When Carlton found out about the money , he blackmailed me . He made me ... do things . No , wait a minute. lf Carlton wasn 't stealing from me , then why did Randall kill him ? Dwight , you don 't understand . No , no , no . I do understand . My brother was sweet on you . He killed Carlton because he knew what was going on between the two of you . Where the hell you been ? Hm ? I got something for you to do . ( Dwight ) Randall , get over here ! Dwight , no . Take it ! She ripped us off , Randall , and you knew it . No , Randall . Did you think the two of you were gonna run off into the sunset together ? She used you . Look at me , Randall . I 'm the one who loves you . Not her . Not anybody else . Cos we 're blood . That 's thicker than anything . I 'm gonna walk away now . And I 'm gonna think hard about how I can forgive you . You know what you gotta do . Randall ? You 're not gonna do this . Randall , please . I was coming back for you . No , you weren 't . Randall ! No ! Agent . Has he said anything ? A county DA came in and he declined representation . Aside from that , he 's been uncommunicative . APB on Tammi Peyton 's a wash so far . The Bureau in Montana 's on alert . He watched her every day , wherever she was . A man who can look at anything in the world , and he chooses her . He must have seen something in her she couldn 't see in herself . If you 're suggesting he could see into her heart , Agent ... I think we 're out of FBI territory on this one . I 'll be out front . Visiontext Subtitles : Yasmin Rammohan ( child ) I made this !

 Ape-men tracks . Three maybe four . It looks like a T-rex scared them off not too long ago . Nice neighborhood . How 's this for a welcome mat ? - Headhunters . - Well let 's not stay for lunch . If the way off this plateau is around here , nobody 's lived to find it . - I say we move on . - I 'm right behind you . Help ! Help me ! Looks like trouble , it 's coming fast . - Too fast . - And heading straight for the edge . Help me ! Help ! Come on Malone . Move over . Whoa up there ! Whoa ! Whoa up there ! Whoa ! Easy ! Whoa there boy ! - Thanks . - Are you all right ? Yes fine thank you . Are you sure you 're okay ? Of course I am . I am Isadore queen of the travelers ... teller of fortunes . At the dawn of the century ... A band of adventurers set out to prove the impossible ... The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations ... and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World I must say I 've been looking forward to these little morsels to share with our guest . I wonder if she 'll get to try Summerlee 's grilled lizard . There . Yes , don 't hold your breath . Isadore queen of the travelers is becoming a royal pain in the ass . The men seem taken by her . Well don 't sweat it ... take away the lips , eyes , perfect skin ... plunging neckline what do you have ? just another common jungle tart . What luck not one but two handsome heroes . And me I must look a mess . No not at all , you look great . Considering you were almost killed . I was never in any real danger . I hate to break it to you , the horse , the cliff . I 've already seen my death and it was not today . - Excuse me ? - I have the gift . Ah yes that 's right you 're psychic . The future is an open book to me ... love , loss ... life , death . yours if you dare . Summerlee I am done being a mule . Be careful you 'll disturb the roots . Let 's load this and get moving . These plants have survived for at least One hundred and sixty million years . The least we can do is to give them five minutes more . Raptor . - Where is he ? - Gone . Did that raptor duck when he saw the rifle ? Impossible . Over there by the path . What do you make of that professor ? That makes three of them between us and the balloon . We 'll never make it . Let 's find a more defensible position . And then what ? We wait them out ... until they decide to look for something easier to eat . This was given to you by someone you love very much , your mother or father . No your mother and father . How could you possibly know that ? I peeked . Do you see them ? I see something ... vague , distant . Are they alive ? There are ropes ... no , chains . Are they captives , slaves ? - It 's not clear . - Will I find them ? I can 't ... they 're gone I 'm sorry . I thought you said you could see them ? Only in your reflection , in the shadows of your future . What do you see ? Trees . Well we are in a jungle and trees are a safe bet . Heed my words . Veronica will become one with the forest . I see you becoming a tree . A tree ? Now will that be a ... birch a willow or a mighty oak ? Mock me but remember this danger awaits . You will be betrayed by a two faced woman . Well I could have told you that . May I ? Not a chance . You 're not interested in your future . I make my own destiny and no one touches my jewelry . What about you my handsome hero ? Me ? Surely someone so brave ... wouldn 't be afraid to know his own fate ? Why not ? I see you . I see my wagon . I see . What ? Death . The melodrama begins . In two days ... you will battle a beast with razor sharp claws ... and the heart will be torn from your chest . We 're safe for now . You get some sleep . I 'll take the first watch . Is it possible those beasts have actually learned to be afraid of guns ? We both saw it . Extraordinary , if they can learn so quickly ? Soon they 'll be near impossible to kill . - They 're still out there aren 't they ? - Waiting for us . Let 's hope they haven 't learned not to be afraid of fire . Lovely night . Beautiful . You saved my life . Oh all in a day 's work . How can I ever repay you ? I guess will just have to settle for a nod and a handshake . Sorry ... I 'm on watch . At least a toast to your health . Surely you wouldn 't deny me that ? One drink . To a handsome brave gallant man , in this selfish uncivilized world . I 'm truly grateful . - And sorry . - Sorry ? For what ? For that . - Sleeping Beauty wakes . - Well it 's about time . My head . Rough night ? What happened ? It appears you were carousing on watch . Well it was just one sip I mean . Yeah right ! Isadore is gone ... along with everything but the shirts off our backs . Everything ? Guns , ammo , packs , changes of clothes . My locket . I still have this . And this . Oh it appears little miss oracle missed that one too . - Let 's go get her . - With what ? She 's got our guns . If I have to I 'll beat her to death with my shoe . hold , hold it right there My my , what an honor , your majesty . No no , Kaysan the honor is mine . A successful trip , your wagon rides deep in its tracks . Just my old rags a few bottles of sour wine . Then you 'll thank us for lightening your load . My my where did you get all this ? Here there , I 'm at the mercy of my fates . Climb down . First a drink to your health Kaysan . Off the wagon . Here hand me something . Any object that is precious to you and I can tell you your future . I already know yours . Four hours ahead , if she stops to sleep we 'll catch her by dawn . I predict it 'll be sooner than that . Hey ! Where are our things ? - I 've been robbed . - You 've been robbed that 's rich . From the looks of it the wagons rolled off with a half a dozen men . - We better move . - You 're not going after them ? That 's where our guns are . If you follow the thieves my Prophecy will come true . Spare me . I saw the heart ripped from your chest . Sorry sweetie he 's not falling for your mumbo jumbo . Malone ? What a clawed beast got your tongue ? The day Veronica sprouts branches I 'll start worrying about my heart . Well maybe there 's something to the prophecies after all . - What ? - Look at yourself . - I look like a ... - A tree . Oh it 's all right Malone it doesn 't mean anything . Sure . Besides even if she is right just this once - so what . - So , tomorrow ... his prophecy will come true . Then I 'll be dead . Where is the damn balloon ? There ! This lines been chewed . Raptors ? I 'm a blasted fool I should have secured it better . You 've couldn 't have known . How long can it fly ? There 's probably enough Hydrogen left for two maybe three hours . Winds light less than four knots . It 'll still travel at least ten miles before the weight grounds it . - I think I can make it . - Yeah of course you can . It will give us a chance to see just how smart out friends have become . This is crazy you don 't stand a chance . We have no choice without our weapons we won 't survive . Where are they taking your wagon ? It 's a big jungle it could be anywhere . Why don 't you close your eyes and take a look . Kaysan has a camp deep in the forest but you can 't go there . Why not ? His bandits have robbed half the tribes on the plateau . A man after your own heart . To Kaysan stranger means enemy . Do you know what they do to unexpected guests ? Boil them in oil . With a little basil and salt I hope . If I take you to his camp he 'll have your head on a pike and more important mine . Now or later your choice . I told you we wouldn 't come back empty handed . Come and get it you ungrateful bastards . Looks like we 've inspired quite a celebration . It 's always like this after a raid . They put their masks back on dance and drink till they drop . Who are the masks supposed to fool ? They already know each other . I imagine that 's the point . It 's always more exciting to dance with a stranger . Besides that 's the closest they can come to being a stranger down there is wearing a mask . What do you think ? My dance cards open . You go down there , my Prophecy will come true . And if I don 't my future will change ? There 's always free will but fate is powerful . Few are strong enough to fight their destiny . You could be wrong , right ? Your predictions don 't always come true , do they ? The gift does not lie . That camisole was hand made in Paris . I forgot to bring my party clothes . Stick with the huts along the perimeter . I 'll go with her . I guess that leaves us to work the party . After you . Always the gentleman . - Hi ! - I don 't know you ? Well would you like to ? - Let 's get our guns and get out of here . - Wait , wait . Damn I 'm good ! Maybe we don 't need the pistols after all . - I don 't see the rifles . - They must be in the huts . My favorite beast . Are you as dangerous as you look ? - Only on the dance floor . - Shall we ? What are you doing in here ? I was looking for a drink . Somebody put all this junk in the way . Buy us a drink sailor ? - Sure . - Great . Thank you . What no kiss ? Hmm delicious . Stranger ! It 's the two faced woman . You weren 't invited to our party . Well don 't worry . I won 't hold it against you . Unmask ! - Excuse me nature calls . - Let 's have a look . We get so few guests here . - Let 's go . - We 've got to save him . First we have to save ourselves . Waste time . How can we help him if we 're dead ? Of course you will stay for dinner ? Gate crashers what a pity . I 'll have to make an example of you . Sorry to put a damper on the party . It would spoil the mood . We 'll kill you tomorrow . Kaysan , surely we must be of some value to you ? He 's useless dead or alive it 's just less trouble dead . You , on the other hand . Try me . There 's only one way to avoid death here . Sign me up . Become one of us . My stuff 's already here I don 't even need to unpack . There is a small initiation . What secret handshake , bandit oath ? Kill him . Couldn 't I just kill you instead ? You have until morning to decide . He dies alone or you both die together your choice . I warned you it would come to this . We 're going back for them . Did you not see the two faced woman ? The second prophecy right on schedule . Your friends are as good as dead . Why are you so anxious to join them ? We go down there we 're all dead . No , there must be a way ? What ? What is it ? There is one way , kill Kaysan . With what ? We only have one knife between us . The bandits live by an ancient code , its hand to hand combat ... a blood challenge to the death . Better odds than we have now . You 're alive now . But they won 't be for long . No one 's ever beaten Kaysan . He 's never fought me . Not you , me . - Ned . - Veronica . I 'm dead before sundown no matter what . The good thing until then I 'm bullet proof . The fates will keep me alive for my date with the clawed beast . There 's no heroism in dying stupidly . Ned you 're not ruthless enough to kill Kaysan . - Veronica . - You 'll lose ... he 'll underestimate me ; at least I 'll stand a chance . Maybe you 're right . Kiss me for luck ? Of course . Sorry . I saw that coming . I 've lost track of the balloon . It 'll follow the wind straight down the canyon . Unless it 's hung up on a tree . Let 's move up the hillside see if we can get a bearing on it . - They 're herding us . - What ? They 're driving us out of the jungle ... down to the valley floor . It doesn 't make sense , why go to all that trouble . They 're pack animals . In the low brush it 'll be easier for them to surround us and kill us . For god sake this is torture . Why don 't they just attack and be done with it ? We 've still got guns and a few bullets . They 're waiting ; they 're waiting for us to run out . And when we do ? Kaysan will be coming soon . I guess if the cavalry was going to show up they would have been here by now . Well if they 're smart ... Veronica and Malone will be half way back to the treehouse by now . How lovely for them . Listen , whatever Kaysan asks ... - ... you do it . - You mean kill you ? Oh I don 't think so . I mean what 's today Tuesday ? I never kill anybody on Tuesdays . It won 't be you killing me . It will be Kaysan . Sure will right after he boils me in oil . - Stop it . - I mean ta-tah Roxton ... see you in that great safari in the sky . For once in your life will you just shut up and listen , now either way I 'm dead . - Roxton . - I won 't have your death on my hands . But I 'm supposed to have yours on mine ? No ! Marguerite please , please . I can 't . I can 't . Times up ... cute . Normally when outsiders visit our happy ... tribe we boil them alive ... but why waist our new toy . One bullet , don 't worry ... you can 't miss from that range . You point it anywhere but at him and we 'll kill you both instantly . Ready ? Listen Kaysan , even if I do this how can I be sure you 'll let me join ? Oh you don 't trust me . I don 't trust anyone . You gave this to me . And now I take it back . A token , after you 're mine I 'll give you everything that was yours and more . Do it . This way . Pull the trigger . Let me help you , ready or not . It 's ok . No . Stop ! I challenge you ! What ? By your own rules you have to fight me . Where 's that fortune telling bitch ? I 'll have her head on a post . It 's your code to the death . There she is . And here we are right where they want us . Go ! go ! I 'll cover you . Get her in the air , I 'll hold them off . Hurry ! Challenger ! Grab the ladder ! Thank god for you Summerlee . You let him go ? You couldn 't stop him , neither could I ? It 's fate . That death you saw was your own . It won 't do you any good to kill me . Maybe not , you know but I 'll feel a lot better . Wait ! I have an idea . It better be good . You 're a fool for coming back Malone , but thank you . If it 's hand to hand combat I have a chance . Remember the bigger they come the harder they fall . A token , for luck . Malone . The clawed beast . Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? The closer to his brain the quicker it will work . Got it . You only get one shot . I know . Get up Malone ! Get up Malone ! Get up Malone ! - Get up , Malone ! - Get up , Malone ! - On your feet ! - Get up ! You should have pulled the trigger when you had the chance . Yes ! No ! - I won ! - Yes ! The Marquees of Queensbury ! What ? What did you do to him ? - I won ! - No , you don 't . - Get back ! - Out of my way . I 'll take that - thank you very much . Nice and slow ! I predict you will all disappear . ok ok That was one hell of a punch Malone . We owe you our lives . Just take it off my tab . That 's for defeating the clawed beast . The prophecy I beat the prophecy . Well maybe , maybe not . She said the heart would be ripped from your chest , she just didn 't say whose . You really do have a gift , don 't you ? As do you , - ... terrifying isn 't it ? - Yes . Thank you . Are you sure you 'll be all right out there alone ? I know I will . Read it . Question of the hour , will we ever get off this plateau ? Yes and no . What a time to go diplomatic . There 's always free will ... but few are strong enough to exercise it . Anyway , you make your own destiny ... right ? Right you are your highness . You thought I wasn 't ruthless enough to beat Kaysan . You 're right , I underestimated you . There 's more to Ned Malone than meets the eye . Now what 've you got for your hero ? Come here . Good to have you back Malone .

 He 's totally checking you out . The first time since Julie left me , I don 't feel completely alone . The DA comes to see at the beginning of summer , tells me the sky is falling , and he hasn 't done a damn thing since . You 're not charging that on the company card , are you ? Why ? Acknowledge me now , or lose me forever . I can 't believe this . So you and Summer ? Not so good , actually . She 'll probably never speak to me again . - Do you guys still talk ? - No , not really . We used to . But it just sort of made everything harder . - We could not go . - Can 't not go . We can so not go . We already missed registration . It 's not like anyone 's expecting us . - Your mom called the school , man . - Uh , did my mom call the ... You 're the bad boy . Okay ? You 're the outsider . You 're supposed to be leading me into temptation , not homeroom . - It 's just the first day of school , man . - Yeah , exactly . An entire day of just Ashton Kutchers , knuckle-knocking and going on and on about summer . Their summer , not my ... The season , not the person . - At this point , how would I even know ? - What , you haven 't called her yet ? Um , before you read this , remind me to explain the difference to you between Plastic Man and Elongated Man . - So that 's a no , then . - When would I have had the time to call her ? I just got back into town . I have three months of back issues to bag and board and on top of that now , apparently I don 't know , I have to go to school . - You could have called her from Portland . - I did call her from Portland . Every day . And I got her voicemail until she finally picked up and said if I ever call her again , her father will have me killed . So Summer has no idea you 're back . Killed , Ryan , as in dead . That was months ago . She 's probably moved on by now . I 'm sorry . " Moved on " ? Gotten over it ? Gotten over it ? Why ? Because I just ... I meant nothing to her ? I 'm going to brood silently . Over here . - No , she 's going to have me killed . - She 's not going to have you killed . Fine , then maybe you 're right . She will ignore me , which would be worse . So , Summer 's been ignoring you for years . You can take it . Yeah , but that was before I knew what it was like to not be ignored . Why should I have to go back to that ? Why ? Because you left for three months without telling her ? - So you 're saying it 's my fault ? - You are kind of the one who left . - Yeah , because of you . - Oh , so it 's my fault ? Do you think she 'll buy that ? - Seth , just talk to her . - And say what , exactly ? I don 't know . " I 'm sorry , " maybe ? Really ? I 'm sorry . Is that what you said to Marissa ? No , but I 'm going to . Oh . Oh , oh , okay , then . So it turns out , what do you know ? I 'm not the only coward in the room . No , I 'm just going to see her at school . I know that . Really ? She 's going to walk up to you in front of the entire student body and be all , " Hey ... " And just hope she " heys " you back ? Yeah , we 're not going to school . Okay , man , listen . Whatever happens today at school , the important thing is the Ryan-Seth team 's back in action , okay ? Together there 's nothing we can 't face . I 'm moving to Portland . - Good morning , men . - Hey . - Sleep well ? - No . - Ready for your first day of school ? - No . - There 's bagels . - There 's coffee . - Love some , thanks . - And then there 's Archie . Yeah . Will you explain to me this whole remodeling thing again ? Your mother got bored this summer . Your father was complaining that he didn 't have a place for his surfing memorabilia . Oh , so it is my fault . - We 'll be out of the kitchen by dinner . - How about the rest of the house ? - Is that the phone ? - Sandy ? - Honey , I 'm mid-shmear . - I am late for work . Well , if I could find it , maybe I 'd answer it . Hello ? Hello ? - Well , they hung up . - I hate it when they do that . I called the school so you 're registered . You just have to go by the office and fill out some paperwork . Your father 's going to go with you in case there 's any problems . All right . I thought you were going to take him ? - I have a meeting . - I have a meeting . If it 's too much trouble , maybe we should stay home . I have to go . - Hello ? - I 'm really glad that you guys are home . - Good , maybe you should raise our allowances then . - He 's where ? You don 't know ? It 's the office . All right . I 'll find him . Thank you . - I have to go . - I have to go . You want me to take them ? This is not an auspicious way to start the school year . - Thanks , Archie . - Don 't worry about it , man . I 'm sure nobody saw us . - Oh , my God . - Oh , my God . - Oh , my God . - Oh , my God ! Ryan ! - Hey ! - Hey . - Oy , wish me luck . - Yeah . Summer . - What are you doing here ? - Uh , I 'm back . I 'm back at the Cohens ' , back at Harbor . I 'm back . But how ? I mean , what about Theresa ? It 's kind of a long story . Well , I want to hear it if you want to tell me . Uh , yeah , sure . Uh , after school ? After school . It 's a date . Summer . - Are you just not even going to talk to me ? - Nope . Sorry , Cohen . You know , maybe I 'll write you a letter and you can read it over and over , trying to figure out what the hell I was thinking all summer . Ass . - Just wait a second . - I am done waiting for you , Cohen . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to go meet my boyfriend . Boyfriend ? I can 't believe this is happening . How much are they offering ? Wow . So when do we have to be there ? I can 't . It 's too soon . I still haven 't told Jimmy yet . 'Cause I don 't want to hurt him . Hey . There you are , to be sure . Jimmy 's up . I 've got to go . I will . I promise . Bye . - Susie says hi . - Susie ... - ... calls too early . - It 's almost 9 : 00 . Whoa . Time for a mimosa . - Are you trying to get me drunk ? - I am trying to keep you drunk . Last night was ... pretty awesome . The whole summer 's been awesome- - the beach , the yacht , you . No , you . You 're the one . Listen , I 've got a really good idea , and I want you to ... I want you to really concentrate on it , okay ? We should keep the boat for another month , and we go down to Cabo . - Jimmy , we can 't . - Why can 't we ? Come on . It 's not like either of us have jobs that we have to go back to . Come on . I 'll manage my portfolio online , and , you know , this way the summer never has to end . You know ? Right ? Am I right ? - Right . - Right . Right . Right . So , I put this schedule together for you , which you 'll probably hate , which is fine . I 'm sure it 's okay . Thanks . I based it on the schedule from last year . - Nice GPA , by the way . - Really ? Thanks . So , is there anything missing ? Favorite subject , favorite teacher ? Electives ? Anything ? Honestly , I 'm just happy not to be working construction right now , so ... You know , Ryan , it 's not too early to start thinking about colleges . Uh , thanks , but I can 't really afford college , and I 'm not about to let the Cohens pay for it . Ryan , you have great test scores , a solid GPA . And if you work your ass off when you get out of here , you can do whatever you want . The question is : what do you want ? How do you mean ? Well , um , what do you like ? What are you interested in ? I don 't know . Seriously , I don 't know . Oh . Okay . I have an assignment for you . I want you to go to your classes and then write down everything you like about them and everything you don 't like about them , and most importantly , why . Then I want you to come by here tomorrow and we 'll go over it together and make sure you get what you want . Miss Fisher , I 'm sure this schedule is fine , really . You 'll find out . Let me know . All right , I 'll see you tomorrow . Yep . Love letter to Marissa ? No , no , it 's , uh ... - Did , uh , did Miss Fisher give you an assignment ? - No , she didn 't . But then again , I didn 't get a warm , cinematic embrace from anyone when I got to school either . - Did you guys talk at least ? - Yeah , we sure did . - Long enough for her to tell me she has a boyfriend . - Oh , buddy , I 'm sorry . It 's all right , man . You know what ? I had a whole life at this school before Summer . - I 'm sure . - Yeah , one of an outcast , maybe , but I 'll have you know , at one point , I was a vital part of the Harbor club scene . - There 's a Harbor club scene ? - Yeah , sure . Sailing club , film club , and , wait for it , wait for it ... comic book club . Check it out . Huh ? - Who 's this guy ? - That 's me with powers . The power to be handsome . What do you think ? I think this may have something to do with the whole outcast thing . No , Ryan , it doesn 't . Listen , Spider Man 2 . Do you know how much money that made at the box office ? We 're not outcasts anymore , okay ? We 're edgy . We 're like trailblazers . - We ? - Listen , Miss Fisher says get involved , right ? Well , I need to get involved on this , get involved , get on board , you , me , comic book club , okay ? And hopefully others . Pass those out . I need you to pass those out . Thank you . Hey , guys . A comic book league . Check it out . We 're going to be getting into the issues , the stuff that matters , you know what I mean ? Today 's topic : " Capes : Fey or kind of cool " ? Ryan , you 'd better be passing those out , my man ! Thanks for taking me to get my car . Anything to get away from Cohen . Do you want to go get lunch after this ? I should probably get back to school . Back to Ryan , you mean ? So tell me , is he taking you to the kickoff carnival ? Are you guys going to go for another spin on the Ferris wheel ? He said we 'd talk after school . - About getting back together ? - No , I don 't know . - Would that be so bad ? - No , I mean ... Well , it 's just ... him and Cohen- - they just can 't think they can walk in and out of our lives whenever they want , you know ? Whose truck is that ? That 's the yard guy 's , and he 's blocking my car in the driveway again . Hey , hey ! DJ , you 're blocking my car . Do not honk at DJ . He 's hot . - He 's the yard guy . - Well , he can park his truck in my driveway any time . I 'll see you back at school . - What are you doing in here ? - I work here . I have to go . So go . Will I still see you today after school ? I can 't , I 'm sorry . It 's just ... It 's okay . Don 't worry . I may still be here when you get back . Hey . - What are we drinking ? - Sum , wait ... What are you drinking ? Did you spike your latte ? - It 's been a weird day . - Marissa , we 're at school . Yeah , exactly . What is going on with you ? Did something happen with Ryan ? What am I supposed to say to him ? About ? About ... DJ . DJ ? Who in the hell is ... Oh , my God , the yard guy ? - Yeah , I know . - Marissa ! Since when ? - Since , I don 't know , all summer . - And you didn 't tell me ? Summer , I couldn 't tell anyone . No one can find out about this . Okay . But God , that is so hot . - No , it 's not , believe me . - Really ? But he 's so ripped . No , he 's great . It 's just ... He 's the yard guy . And now Ryan 's back and ... - I don 't know what to do . - Well , just explain it to him . He left . And suddenly there was a hot , hot yard guy in the yard , who is hot . So you really didn 't do anything wrong . If I didn 't do anything wrong , then why do I have to tell him ? Well , if it really is over with DJ , then I guess you don 't . Come on , let 's go get you some coffee with actual coffee in it . Two coffees , please , black . You 're going to lose that hand , Sanford . Since when is scotch a part of your nutritious brunch ? Since the DA 's office finally decided they had enough to indict me . So what did they finally decide to charge you with ? Bribing certain city officials to obtain building permits . Oh , that 's a new one . Is there any truth in it ? Please . Why would I need to bribe anyone , hmm ? - Oh , yeah , I own this town . - Sure you do.You bought it . All right , I admit that I have done some things that I 'm not too proud of , but I did not do what they are accusing me of . Well , then they 'll have no case . What they do have , however , are documents : bank statements showing large sums of money being transferred from the Newport Group to the City Councilman 's office . Well , how , how is that possible ? I don 't know . Will you help me ? How ? I was hoping you could tell me that . Hey . - Yeah , okay , sorry I 'm late . - No , no , you 're right on time , buddy . We 're just getting started . Ryan , would you please take the minutes ? - Seth , it 's just us . - Yeah , uh-huh , write that down . I now call to order this year 's first Harbor School Comic Book League meeting . Members include Seth Cohen ... present . - Ryan Atwood . - Seth , if it 's just ... Ryan Atwood . Present . Seth , if it 's just you and me , can we maybe do this at home ? Yeah , we could , but then we wouldn 't get our pictures in the yearbook . That might not be such a bad thing . Maybe you couldn 't undermine me in front of the league . What about that ? Hey , I 'm here for the comic book club . - You are ? - You are ? Yeah , why wouldn 't I be ? - Um , because you 're on the water polo team ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? Okay , you want to talk comics , guy , let 's talk comics . - What day of the week do new comic books come out on ? - Wednesday . - What 's Wonder Woman 's secret identity ? - She doesn 't have one . - True , which I think is a mistake , by the way . - I know , me , too . - Who 's your favorite superhero ? - Depends who 's writing him , but I 'd have to say Superman . - Superman . This guy , he 's too perfect , guy . - No . He seems perfect , but he 's not . I mean , if you think about it , he 's actually kind of messed up . I mean , he lost his parents . He lost his whole planet . He 's like totally alone . And this is a guy who could take over the world if he wanted , but he doesn 't . He just keeps helping people . Why would he do that , you know ? Unless he was trying to make a connection . Trying to , like , find his way home . - Who 's your favorite writer ? - Bendis . - Well , hot damn , welcome to the club . - Thanks . - This is going to be good . - Today 's topics , we have some topics ... The Hulk . He gets bigger . All his clothes rip off except ... his pants . Why is that ? - From now on we 'll meet up every Wednesday ... - Yes . - Hit the comic book store . - Yes . - And then we 'll hang out . - That will be awesome . I 'll hit you with those Green Lantern JPEGs , all right ? Yeah , definitely do that . - Dude , I love that guy . - Yeah . Whoa . You 're not the only one . What 's going on ? No , she cannot be dating him . That 's not even possible . - How is that possible ? - A second ago you wanted to date him . Yeah , that 's because he 's me . You see what she 's doing , don 't you ? She 's basically dating the WASP version of me . It 's so stupid . - What , you think Zach is ... - Yeah , I actually do ... Look at him ! He 's like , what , the conventionally attractive , you know , athletic , confident , just , completely non-neurotic , WASP version of me . So there it is- - the haunted mansion . Damn , I am definitely not in Chino anymore . - So have you talked to Theresa at all since ... - Since we lost the baby ? No . But we didn 't really talk a whole lot while I was there , either . So you weren 't really a couple ? I mean , you never ... No , no , uh , it wasn 't really like that ... at all . So uh , what about you ? You ... dating anybody ? Uh , no . I 'm not dating anybody . Okay , so if you 're not dating anyone , maybe you would want to go to the kickoff carnival with me tomorrow ? Hmm , well , I don 't know . Can we go on the Ferris wheel ? Because my last boyfriend was afraid of heights . Poor guy , didn 't know what he was missing . Come on , I can 't wait for you to see the rest of the house . And the look on my mom 's face when she sees you in it . - You got a job ? - No , it 's not just a job . It 's a whole new career ... in fashion . - Hailey ... - In sales . Hailey ! - In Japan . - Oy ! How 's Jimmy doing with that ? He 's great . He doesn 't know . Hailey . I tried to tell him , but he just seems so ... happy all the time . He 's making so much money on the market that all he wants to do is drink and sail and go to Cabo . You poor thing . - I 'm too young for early retirement . - And you 're too old to keep running away . I 'm not running this time . I have a shot to make a real future out of this . Jimmy just seems kind of ... stuck . He loves you . I love him , too . Then you have to tell him . - I can walk on my own , you know . - Yeah , when you 're not drunk . Oh , no , you 're all right . You 're fine . - Oh , my God . Cal ? - Oh , I spoke too soon . What 's the matter with him ? Is he all right ? Did he have a stroke ? I 'm fine . He , uh , had a bottle of scotch . - You got him drunk ? - No , I took him to lunch to try to get him sober . I am not ... drunk . Somebody tell me what 's going on . - Cal . - I 'm going to bed . The pleasure was all yours , Sanford . Enjoy . - You may want to sit down . - You may want to just tell me . Caleb is going to be indicted . I don 't know when , but the DA 's office has been investigating him for ... for a while now . For how long ? How long have they been investigating him , Sandy ? Since before the wedding ? Son of a bitch . Well , you know , he didn 't want to worry you . Is he going to jail ? Well , they 're accusing him of bribing city officials , and , apparently , they have proof . - I wish there was something I could do . - No , you don 't . You despise him , you despise me , and you would love nothing more than to see us get exactly what we deserve , right ? - No , Julie , no . - Let me tell you something . If Caleb 's going down , you 'd better believe Kirsten 's going with him . So you 'd better come up with something , or it won 't be just my kids who lose everything . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to go take care of my husband . - Hey . - Hi . - How 's it going ? - Oh , let me help you with that . - How was your first day at school ? - Uh ... it was all right , actually . How 'd it go with Miss Fisher ? Is that your assignment ? - Oh , she told you about that ? - Yeah . Yeah , she called to tell me that she wants us all to sit down and start talking about colleges for you . - Ryan , that is just fantastic . - Where the hell are you going ? - You 're paying me to work , aren 't you ? - I thought I was . I thought I was . - Ryan ! Did you tell her ? - Uh , no , but ... Ryan figured out why there is still no wall in our former family room . - There 's no wall because ... - Because this genius misread the blueprints and ordered the wrong size steel I-beam , and then was hoping we wouldn 't notice while he bills us for all the time it 's going to take to get it right . - We 're doing other things . - You 're drinking our coffee , eating our bagels . - Taking your kids to school . - Look , I ordered the right I-beam . They just delivered the wrong one . Archie , I get that , but , uh , can I ask you something , man ? If ... if you just move the new wall out about ten inches , couldn 't you just use the I-beam that you got ? - You an architect , kid ? - No , but I worked a little construction ... - Then don 't tell me how to do my job . - You have no right to talk to him like that . How come there 's still couches in my kitchen ? You said you 'd be out of here by dinnertime . - What are you looking for , another free meal ? - You want us gone , we 're gone . Get your little construction worker here to finish the job for you . - Archie , don 't go ! - No , no , no . Thanks for the coffee . Please ! Sandy , apologize . I have nothing to apologize to him for . Nothing . And I am sick to death of putting myself on the line for this family and getting nothing . Do you want to apologize ? Apologize . I 'm done . I 'll call Archie and apologize . No . You 're right . He should have told us about the beams . I 'll call a new contractor in the morning . I know I wasn 't the easiest person to live with this summer . I was just really upset about the boys being gone ... and I took it out on you . I 'm sorry . You know ... what I said in there- - it wasn 't about you . - Thank God , ' cause you were scary . - Really ? I was scary ? Yeah . I mean , I 've never seen you go off on anyone like that , except for my dad , and ... Oh , no . What did he do now ? - Hey . - Hey . - You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm just tired . You missed all the drama . It 's all right . I think I got my quota for the day . How 'd it go with you and Marissa ? She 's gonna go to the kick-off carnival with me tomorrow . You want to come with ? Hang out with you and Marissa and Summer and Zach ? Is that really how it 's gonna be from now on ? Probably , I don 't know . Well , great . Can never hang out with you again . See ya . Come on , why not ? Doesn 't mean we can 't all be friends . Dude , do you really think Summer 's going to want to be friends with me , after what I did to her ? Especially now that she has a Zach attack ? The guy 's like Superman . He 's not Superman . He 's like the thoroughbred , and I 'm the monkey with cymbals . All right , so what are you going to do ? You gonna spend a whole year with Captain Oats ? - It 's not like I have any choice . - Of course you do . Just pick up the phone . Call her . Look , be her friend . I can 't , man . It 's too late . She 's not going to want to hear anything I have to say . Okay . So , what happened was , Susie and I were roommates in Santa Cruz . Until we dropped out of college to start our own fashion line . You had your own fashion line ? No , because we took all my dad 's money and moved to Paris and partied until I had to move back . Oh . Now that is the American dream . But Susie stayed in Paris . She got a job at Chanel and just sold her first collection to a company in Japan . - Well , here 's to Susie . - To Susie ... who asked me to be her sales rep and move to Japan . More wine ? She asked you to move to Japan ? I know , right ? So ... what did you say ? I said I 'd ... talk to you about it . You 're asking me to move to Japan ? No . You 've got your kids . You have a whole life here , and being with you has made me realize that I want all that . I want a job . I want a future . - I don 't want to run away anymore . - Well , then don 't . - You can have all that here . - I can 't . The money 's in Japan . - So , I 'll ... I 'll back you . - No . Jimmy , I can 't take your money . It wouldn 't be my money . It 'd be , it 'd be our money . Marry me . What ? Look , I 've had and lost enough jobs to know that the only thing that 's important in this life are the people in it and I want you ... in my life , Hailey . I want to marry you . Happy , high vibrations attract happy , high vibrational circumstances . Yucky , low vibrations attract ... - I 'm doing my homework ! - ... yucky low vibrational circumstances . It 's , it 's the same principle as ... You know , if I fail Intro to Pre Calc this semester all because of you ... Ryan ? Uh ... I 'm sorry . I thought you were the evil stepmonster . She let me in . She seems nice . Yeah , well , she just switched antidepressants . Give it a day . - Can I come in ? - Sure ... Wait . - Did Cohen send you ? - No . No , he has no idea I 'm here . - So . - So . - You just in the neighborhood ? - No . Uh ... - I owe you an apology . - It 's my fault Seth took off last summer . Oh , Ryan , stop it . It 's so not . No . If I hadn 't left , then you guys would still be together . That is not true . He would have found some Coheny way to break us up . He can 't help it . He 's Cohen . Come . Sit . Okay , um ... Look , I know you have a boyfriend . What ? Whoa . No , who told you that ? - I thought you told Seth that . - Well , yeah , to torture him . No , see , Zach and I , we 're just hanging out . He is not my boyfriend . I do not want a boyfriend , okay ? I had a boyfriend . He sailed away . Which was wrong , but ... but he cares about you so much , and if you could , if you could just give him another chance , then maybe we could all go back to the way that we were ? How ? You guys just left . For three months . You moved on . I moved on . Marissa moved on . What ? I mean the way we were wasn 't always so great . You guys had to deal with Marissa 's mom , Luke , Oliver , Theresa ... and Cohen and I never should have fuck up . Look , just trust me on this . Things are the way they are for a reason . You should go talk to Marissa . You can 't keep calling me , DJ . You shouldn 't even be here right now . We 're in the middle of dinner . Who is he ? He was my boyfriend . So you 're back together now ? - I 'm sorry . - You didn 't look sorry when you were kissing him . - That 's not fair . - Don 't talk to me about fair ! - What were you doing with me all summer ? - I know , but he 's my boyfriend . - And I 'm the yard guy , right ? - DJ , come on . You don 't think I hear the way you talk about me around your friends ? - We agreed we wouldn 't tell anyone . - Because I 'm the yard guy . Because you could get fired . You know what ? I quit . Have fun explaining that to your mom . DJ , wait . I 'm not like that . You know I 'm not like that . Please . Hey . Don 't cry . Please , don 't cry . So I pull in the driveway , and Marissa is full-on making out with some guy I 've never seen before . - What did you do ? - Nothing . I drove off . I guess you should have called first . She said she wasn 't dating anyone , you know ? Maybe she 's not . Maybe , you know , they just hook up for sex . I 'm sorry . I 'm just distracted . Listen , man , I cannot believe you talked to Summer for me . Dude , thank you . That was just above and beyond you . - Now you just have to help me get her back . - Seth . - She said she wants to try again . - Yeah , as friends . Ryan , come on . Why would she go through all the trouble of telling you that Zach is specifically not her boyfriend if she just wanted us to be friends ? Seth , why would she go through all the trouble of telling you she just wants to be friends if she doesn 't ? Because she 's hurt and she 's scared and she 's hiding behind walls . Yeah , and I will bring those walls down with one single grand gesture . - No . No grand gestures . No . - Yes , yes , I 'm afraid it is time once again for me to stand on that proverbial coffee cart and declare my love for her . Maybe I 'll do it at the carnival . You know what I 'm saying ? Maybe it 'll be a hot dog stand . Okay , all right , all right . What do I do about Marissa ? I don 't know . I mean , what do you want to do ? You sound like Miss Fisher . Ahh ! Forgot to finish the assignment . Hey . Yeah , you see where this is going ? This is good . Look . Marissa 's distracting you from school again . Summer and I are getting back together . The thing is , by the end of kick-off carnival , the four of us , we 're gonna be exactly the way we were . Dad , what are you doing here ? - He 's having breakfast . - Julie 's not talking to me . She left me a note to say she 's booked herself into the Montage for a $ 3,000 spa weekend . But you get the Sandy Cohen lox scramble with rye toast . So are you here to see Sandy so he can bail you out again ? No , I 'm not dragging Sandy into anything . Before he put these eggs in front of me , he was the closest thing I have to a friend in this town . I came to apologize , Kiki . And to ask you to remember that whatever happens in that courtroom , I did what I did for this family . I should go . - Where to ? - Probably interviewing lawyers all day . Then I imagine I 'll be at home tonight shredding documents . Oh , don 't do that . Have dinner with us instead . I won 't cook . I promise . Although if Kirsten 's mad enough at you ... she might . I don 't want to be any trouble . We 'll order in . So , so the thing is , I 'm not really a writer at all . Words are kind of not my thing . Obviously . Uh ... So maybe if I had some more time ... What is this ? What I was doing when I should have been doing what you asked me to do ? Yeah , but , uh , what is it ? It 's , uh , the Cohens ' new family room . Uh , actually , that 's ... that 's what it should have looked like , but the contractor kind of didn 't know what he was doing . Could I see your schedule , please ? Yeah . Because we 're going to need to get you into some advanced math and science classes . - Some calculus , physics ... - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Uh ... why ? You 'll need them if you want to become an architect . Isn 't that what you want ? - Hey . - You taking off ? Yeah , Dad 's coming over for dinner tonight . I left a message on Hailey 's cell , inviting you guys , but I never heard back . That 's ' cause she 's probably halfway to Japan by now . - Did she at least tell you or ... ? - Yeah . No , she told me . Yeah . I just didn 't listen . I asked her to marry me instead . Oh , Jimmy . No , it 's good . It 's good , it 's ... It 's , you know , I 'm happy for her . It 's , you know , it 's what she always wanted , so . - What do you want ? - I don 't know . I thought I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Hailey . - It was ... it was fun . - I 'm sure . Living on a yacht , drinking all day , sailing off to Cabo . How come when you say it , it sounds bad ? Listen to me . You can do whatever you want with your life , but you 're not going to waste it . Won 't let you . Hailey 's made her move . What 's yours ? - We could just not go . - We can 't not go ; we 're here . Look at them . Oblivious , having fun . To them it 's all funnel cakes and fried Snickers- - just a chance to mingle it up with the carney folk and win a really awesome stuffed sock monkey . But for us ? But for us , kickoff carnival usually determines the course of our romantic lives for the entire year . - No pressure . - No , we did good last year . We did okay . You kissed Marissa on the Ferris wheel , Summer threw up on my shoes . I think I know how she felt . I 'm going to go find a hot dog stand to climb . Good luck . - I was going to tell you . - No , you weren 't . - I asked you point-blank , and you lied . - I didn 't lie . - Marissa ... - What was I supposed to do ? Wait for you ? You weren 't coming back . I wanted you to tell me the truth . His name is DJ . He works for my parents , so we had to keep it a secret from everyone . We 're not seeing each other anymore . After last night when he found out about me , right ? Look , I 'm sorry . For right now , we should ... we should just be friends . Friends ? Ryan , we 're not friends . We were never just friends . I guess that solves the problem , then . See ya . So what 'll it be ? Funnel cake or fried Snickers ? - Uh , bottled water . - What ? You can 't come to a carnival and just have bottled water . No , I meant with the funnel cake and the Snickers . What ? Cohen ... what are you doing ? Nothing . Why ? Well , it looks like you 're humping the hot dog stand . No , actually , Summer , I 'm not even humping anything . You know how I love to stand on countertops in public places . - You know , hot dog stands , coffee carts . - Oh , no . - Because Summer Roberts ... - Cohen , do not ! - I love you ! - What ? Hi , Zach . How 's it going ? Zach , don 't listen to him . He 's crazy . He reads comic books . - I know . So do I. - You do ? Zach , listen . I really hope that this doesn 't affect the league . It 's just that Summer and I sort of have a history . - But no future ! We are leaving . - Wait . Hang on a second . Just hear me out for a second . - Cohen , back off . I mean it . - Fine , just hear me out for , like , one second . Seth , she said back off . Please ? - You all right ? - No , but I have not yet begun to fight , Ryan , or grovel , should it come to that . Oh , my God . Cohen ? ! - Oh , my God ! Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - God ! - Ow ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ! This isn 't a game , Cohen ! You could 've gotten hurt ! Good thing I didn 't . What do you want from me , Cohen ? I just want you . No , you don 't . You had me . You had me at Chrismukkah in a frigging Wonder Woman costume , and you chose Anna . You had me three months ago , and you left . - I want to make that up to you . - It has nothing to do with me . It is about you , and it is always about you , what you need and what you want , you know ? It seems that you only want me when you can 't have me . You like the chase , and that 's all . So you know what ? You can have it . I 'm going home . All right , man , let 's go home . Hey , guys . You 're home early . Um , you hungry ? There 's some moo shoo left . - You want some ? - Grandpa , you eating on the floor ? Yes , it has come to this . Unfortunately , the family room is still stuck inside the kitchen . - How was school ? - It was really good . I 'm never going back . - Ah , just what a father likes to hear . - Yeah . Ryan broke up with Marissa again . - Oh , Summer broke up with Seth again . - Zach will never talk to us again . - Who ? - New guy . - I 'll get it . - But on the plus side , you know , Ryan- - he 's taking AP physics ; he 's taking AP math ; and this moo shoo looks delicious . - It 's really good . - Caleb Nichol ? Sir , you 're under arrest . Gentlemen ... - What took you so long ? - You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning . What 's going on ? - Your father will explain it . - Dad , I 'm so sorry . You have absolutely nothing to apologize for . - Do you understand these rights ? - Yeah . Put your hands behind your head . Don 't say anything . I 'll follow you to the station . I 'm his lawyer .

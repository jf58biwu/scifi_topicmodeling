 It 's time to wake up and get a life . We live in a three-dimensional world . Until now , the world of computing 's been flat , consisting of two-dimensional imagery . Now , through the use of exclusive breakthrough technology , ARC has made it possible for you to get a life . A Life , where we can work and play in a lifelike world of three-dimensional reality . A Life , the living monitor . Impressed ? Yeah , I am . Would you put one of those in a box for me ? - Are you the lawyer ? - I 'm Rita Dunne . Obviously , no one from Nexim could be here today . - I 'd invite you in , but ... - Good luck , Mr. Jennings . - I 'll see you in two months . - Yeah . Home sweet home . What do you think ? This is the exact same technology ? Not the exact same technology , no . Ultimately , I decided to reconceive some of it . I never liked the way the monitor looked . And then it occurred to me who needs it ? Gentlemen , I am the future of computing . And I would like to present you with Nexim 's new Freedom Line of display technology . New from Nexim . Freedom is in your future . Launch this now . ARC is not gonna last . Who said 100 percent market share 's impossible ? Get me Marketing immediately . This far exceeds our expectations . Congratulations . Well thank you . You understand , Mr. Jennings , you 've done in two months what we 've been trying to do for three years . Sometimes it 's easier if you work backwards . Cheers . You won 't remember me , will you ? No . That 's too bad . Marker reached . OK . We 're now extracting his memory from the marker forward to the present . Jesus , Rita . Jesus Christ ! This is dangerous enough . If this man 's brain temp goes one C above 43 , he 's a veg . Come on , Mike . Here we go . It 's all clean . Good morning , sunshine . Hey , how you doing , big guy ? - OK ? - Yeah . All right . Thank you . Take it easy . Slow , slow , slow . There 's no hurry , OK ? - That 's it . Good ? - Yeah . Good man . Hey , Mike , look at me . Look at me . Right here . What 's the last date you remember ? - October 19 . - Very good . Mike , what 's the last thing you remember ? The Red Sox made the playoffs . OK . Let 's get the legal out of the way , shall we ? Mr. Michael Jennings , under the terms of your non-disclosure agreement , you are considered never to have been an employee . You also understand that all your work is the intellectual property of Nexim ... Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I never worked here . I never saw anybody . I never was here . I got it . Is my paycheck ready ? Alrighty . - How you feeling , tiger ? - Good . - Now let 's hear you . - All right . - Ready ? - Yeah . Go ! In order to zero the full eight weeks I had to heat your brain to 42.5 C. - I 'm fine . - I 'm saying it 's getting harder , Mike . - I said , I 'm fine . - You 're slowing down . Come on . I 'd be faster if you 'd shut up . Show me what you 've got , grasshopper . That 's it . That 's more like it ! Yes ! Go , go , go ! Go ! Go ! Yes ! Faster ! Beautiful ! Yes ! One more ! One more , Mikey ! See how you did that ? How you focused ? - Yeah . I focused on your face . - You know you love me . Come on . Don 't be mean to the one who does everything for you . Do you realize you 've never once asked me what I see when I erase your memory ? Basically , the last two months just never happened for you . What 's to know ? 20 hours a day in a clean room ripping off a guy 's idea for a computer , selling it to somebody else . What 'd you do the last two months ? The last thing I remember is driving in Spain in the Aston Martin , learning to dive in Belize with what 's-her-name . The seven-stadiums-in-seven-days trip . It 's great . I mean , my memories are basically highlights . It 's good . It 's a good life . The stuff you erase , it doesn 't matter . What is it with guys like Rethrick ? He 's gotta have everything , huh ? Say what you want about Jimmy , he started Allcom in his garage . Wait , wait . Don 't you leave me alone . What ? You 'll be fine . Talk . Mingle . I don 't want to mingle . Hello . I 'm Michael . I 'm Rachel . Rachel Porter . Is that Miss or Mrs ? That would be Dr. Porter . Doctor . Well , excuse me , doctor . It 's all right . What kind of a doctor are you ? - I 'm a biologist . - Really ? Do you work for Jimmy ? It must be very top-secret biology that you practice . Oh , yes . Isn 't everything ? Let 's go . Excuse me ? I mean , I 'm happy to continue blathering on , trying helplessly to charm you , but I thought maybe , you know , cut to the chase and just , you know , go somewhere . I 'll tell you what , Michael . I 'm gonna walk over there and talk to a friend of mine . If you get the urge to have a real conversation , you 'll know where to find me . OK . Fair enough . It was nice to meet you . Giving up so easily ? You don 't believe in second chances , now , do you ? In my experience , no , I don 't . - Good night . - Good night . - Mike . - Jimmy . - How you doing ? - Good . - Good to see you . - You too . - Thanks for coming . - Thanks for having me . - Come back this way . - Sure . Hey , Jimmy . Now you 're talking . Thank you . Wait a second . Isaac , disable fire protection , please . Alarm disabled . I don 't think you 'd look good covered in foam . Even in that suit . What 's the pitch , Jimmy ? I know you 're trying to sell me something . What is it ? When there was a time we were in school , we wanted to change the world . I thought we wanted to save the world . Well , that 's semantics . - What 's the job , Jimmy ? - Can 't tell you . Other than to say that it involves optics . And you get stock options for this one . Get a real piece of the company . What if it doesn 't work ? I get a real piece of nothing . I promise you , it won 't fail . How do you know that ? Is this a real crystal ball ? I wish . The point is , I 'll guarantee that you do eight figures . - Minimum . - What 's the catch ? The job may require a little bit more time than you 're used to . - How much more time ? - Two years . Maybe three . - You 're kidding . - Deadly serious . Jimmy , that 's impossible . You can 't do it . The longest ever is eight weeks . It was me . Assuming it were possible , would you do it ? - Give up three years of my life ? - Not give up , trade . Three years in return for the rest of your life . One big paycheck . You 're done . A lot can happen in three years . You blink , it 'll be over . Two seconds . A heartbeat , then snap , you 're rich beyond your wildest dreams . One big paycheck . You 're done . Mr. Jennings . John Wolfe . Welcome . You won 't be allowed to leave the grounds . You 'll be assigned a residence here on campus . Your mail will be screened , no phone calls . Anything you receive will have to be inspected . OK . I 'll need your personal belongings . Watch , wallet , anything else . Nothing 's allowed to be brought in . These items will be returned to you when you pick up your paycheck . Sorry . Those too . - Mike , hey , you made it . - Yeah . - Good to see you . - You too . - Everything OK ? - Yep . Sit down . I assume Mr. Wolfe gave you all the fine print . Yeah . He also took the last pair of sunglasses I 've managed not to lose . I 'm sorry . What is this ? It 's for your memory wipe . We inject you with an isotope , migrates to your brain serves as a marker . Another injection erases everything back to the marker . No barbaric cooking of the brain . All right . Wow . - What have I gotten myself into ? - Let 's go find out . Initiating Blue Script directory . Impressive . This used to be our smallest unit . Now it 's our most profitable . Mr. Rethrick , may I speak with you for a moment ? - Have a look around . I 'll be right back . - OK . Cycle complete . Begin transmission of data . All right ! I give up ! I give up . Don 't give up . Dr. Porter . I guess I 'm lucky you didn 't use thunder and lightning . True . OK , well , I won 't question your powers in the future . Sorry , I just couldn 't help myself . I thought you said Marianne was on a plane . She was planning to make the conference call from the plane , sir . Look . I should probably apologize for my behaviour the other day . I get like that sometimes , and I shouldn 't . I 'm sorry . Careful . You are in danger of sounding like you want a second chance . - Everything OK ? - Yeah . - Say something else . - Excuse me ? Say something nice . Quick , otherwise I 'll forget it . Was that little breeze for our boy here ? Well , I owed him one . Now we 're even . Be nice , Mike 's moving into the neighbourhood . Oh . - See you around . - OK . - You ready ? - Yeah . Let 's go . You can still back out . No hard feelings . No , I want to stay . Michael Jennings , meet the other half of your team , Dr. William Dekker . - Nice to meet you . - It 's a pleasure . Gentlemen . Let 's have a look at the next three years of your lives . What happened ? Michael . You 're done . - How long was it , Jimmy ? - It 's been three years , Mike . - How 'd I do ? - You did good . Your money 's been transferred to your account at Reddy Grant . You 've got an appointment there at 1 : 00 . Just go home , do the paperwork . When you feel up to it , give me a call . We 've got a lot of catching up to do . Ninety-two million dollars . Everyone at Reddy Grant appreciates your business . Well , not as much as I appreciate my business , I promise you . OK . Just sign there . - All right . - Great . - Your personal items . - Yes . You only needed four stamps . Oh , well , guess I could afford the extra 50 cents . I don 't think this is my stuff . - It 's not ? - No . - I don 't know what happened . - It 's all right . Don 't worry about it . It doesn 't matter . Let 's talk about my shares . What I 'd like to do is get some money now , and , you know , put the rest away for long term , to live off . So how do we do that ? Mr. Jennings , you forfeited your shares . I beg your pardon ? What ? Yeah , here . Dated four weeks ago . You surrendered the shares and stated to deliver only the envelope of personals . - Don 't you remember doing that , sir ? - No . I don 't remember that , because I didn 't do that . Why would I do that ? I wouldn 't do that . It doesn 't make sense . A mistake has been made , and it needs to be corrected . - I agree . It 's a strange thing you did ... - It 's not strange . Strange is a little out of the ordinary , but still plausible . Giving away $ 100 million in shares in a Fortune 500 company for some knickknacks isn 't strange , it 's insane . No one would do that . Doesn 't make sense . Unless you think this is a $ 40-million can of hair spray , which is pink . What , this is a $ 100-million book of matches ? I 've been out of it a few years . Is this back in style now ? Are these $ 100-million sunglasses ? I 'll look into it , but it 's gonna take me some time . This is crazy . I 'm gonna make some phone calls . Mr. Rethrick 's office . - It 's Michael Jennings . It 's important . - I 'm sorry , he stepped away . He won 't be back until this afternoon . I can try him on his cell phone . Just have him call me as soon as he gets in . OK ? - OK . - Thank you . Listen , guys , a mistake has been made here . All right ? - I 'm not a traitor . I 'm an engineer . - A reverse engineer , right ? We know that you accepted payment of classified government technology . Mike , that 's called treason . In this country , people get fried for that one . In this country when the FBI harasses you , you also get an attorney . Not today you don 't . What the hell is this ? The attorney general calls me and says that Michael Jennings ' cooperation is a matter of national security . Look , first of all , that stuff isn 't mine , OK ? A mistake ... What is ? Perfect fit . You were saying ? Well , let me show you a few pieces of the puzzle that we 're solving . William Dekker , government physicist , weapons division . Three years ago , his project gets shelved . He didn 't like that , so he sold his work . Classified work . Showed it to several corporations . We think Rethrick bought it . Unfortunately , we can 't link Rethrick to the sale , because Dekker died . Natural causes . " Natural " being gravity after a 140-foot fall out of his apartment building . What does this have to do with me ? Patent applications filed this month . They show designs based on Dekker 's work . Look whose signature is on every one of those documents . Get it ? It 's your name on those patents ! Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or the design . You need to tell us everything you did for Rethrick . - I can 't . - You 'd rather spend your life in prison protecting your friend ? - Help us , and we can work with you . - I can 't . I can 't ! He wiped my memory ! I don 't remember ! I 'll tell you whatever I know . I was set up . Believe me . I don 't remember what I did for the past three years ! What ? Wait a second ! Wait ! We figured Rethrick tried a wipe , so we 'll try an extraction . You 're not gonna see anything . You 're wasting your time . We 're getting something here . Come on ! Come on ! Shit . We got nothing . Hold on a second . I need a smoke . Boss . He won 't mind . - Smoke ! - Shit ! - Goddamn it ! - I can 't see anything ! Secure the door ! Where the hell is he ? - He 's loose ! - Don 't worry , he can 't go anywhere ! Cover the door ! I 'll get the lights ! I can 't see ! Get low to the ground ! Stay low to the ground ! Mitchell ! See anything ? - Is that him ? - Klein , where 'd you go ? Al , shut the door ! What 's going on ? Good night , Mikey . Copy that . - Watch it , coming through ! - Go ! Go ! Go ! - Coming through ! - Out of the way ! - See him ? - I see him ! - Out of the way , lady ! - There ! Move ! Move ! Move ! - Coming through ! - Let 's go ! Excuse me . Coming through ! - Out of the way ! Open those gates ! - Watch it , man . Come on ! Come on ! Where did he go ? I 'll get men at every stop ! He 'll be long gone by then ! How the hell did he do that ? - Sorry . - You all right ? - Yeah , yeah . I 'm fine . - Be careful . Hey ! Hey ! Watch it ! Hey ! Hey ! Jane . Relax . Everything 's fine . You talked to federal agents . It 's OK . It 's been worked out now . I just need to find out who sent these items . Will you help me out ? - They were sent three years ago . - No . There was a mix-up . Somebody else sent these . I need to find out who that is and talk to them . Replacements were sent a few weeks ago . - Who sent it ? - Well , you did . That 's you right here . See ? Twenty items . I 'm gonna need all your personal belongings . Michael Jennings died at three minutes after 3 . The government , left with no case , closed its investigation of Allcom . So you see , it 's impossible that he escaped unless you changed something . I didn 't . - What were you doing , exactly ? - I was eating pie . He left the attorney 's office exactly when it predicted . The Feds took him exactly when it predicted ... But he didn 't die like it predicted ! Michael Jennings is not a super agent . He 's an engineer . Yet somehow he managed to escape from a double-Iocked room . How ? Was it fate ? No , fate was on our side . That means someone changed something . And it wasn 't me . And if it wasn 't you , then who the ? Has anyone checked the machine since Michael walked out of here ? Find him . " If you only look where you can 't go , " you will miss the riches below . " Yeah , I 'm already missing my riches . " 17-44-4-26-37-40-22 . " A combination ? A code ? A password ? " New Liberty Savings . " New Liberty Savings Bank , please . What does that mean ? You 're saying the bank doesn 't exist ? That 's comforting . Who sent these items ? You did . That 's you right here . See ? Twenty items . These are patent applications . Look whose signature is on every one of those documents ! A mistake has been made here . I 'm not a traitor ! Dekker died ! Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or the design . Believe me ! I don 't remember what I did for the past three years ! Michael . Michael . You 're done . Hello ? Jesus , Shorty . You don 't know how good it is - to hear a familiar voice . - Michael ? Listen , man . I 'm in a ... I 'm in a jam , and I need you . All right . Meet me at Union Station at 9 : 00 . - I 'll be there . - OK , buddy . Outbound local from Seattle to Kent departing from track five . Eastbound Spokane , gate ten . Michael . Say one word about this hat and I 'm out of here . Oh , man ! Oh , my God . I told you not to take that job , Mike . - Come on , let 's get a table . - OK . - Injections ? - Yeah . You would have to do it that way , I guess . But , of course , that 's a chemical process . So ? Well , you 'd have some latent memories . Maybe that 's what I 'm seeing . Most likely . Memories that made it through the wash , stirred up when the feds went in your head . Why would I have these things ? Explain this . I sent myself this junk instead of the money . Oh , brother . I don 't know . That 's not the question you should be asking . - No ? - No . You should be asking yourself , why did you give up all that money ? That 's the most bizarre part of this whole thing . Ninety million dollars . Nobody changes that much in three years . OK , all right , buddy . I wanna figure out what you built . All right , let 's work backwards . They told me I was working on a design by someone named Dekker . - Dekker ? - Yeah . - William Dekker ? - I think so . What I heard was , he was working on something level five for the feds . They came in , shut him down . - What was it ? - Well , the consensus was a laser . - Why ? - Because Dekker 's drawings called for a mirror and a lens . The only thing that uses those is a laser or a satellite camera to see things from far away . Here comes the first number , 17 . Followed by 44 . - The lens required perfect optics . - Four . - The mirror ... - Twenty-six . - So the capital outlay is huge . - Thirty-seven . - Word was it was gonna cost - Forty . - 500 billion dollars . - And the bonus number is 22 . Who 's gonna spend 500 billion dollars just to see something ? What ? No way I get out of that extraction room without the cigarettes and the glasses . I would 've never gotten on the bus without the ticket . If I didn 't have the ring , I wouldn 't have followed that kid to Reddy Grant . - Right . - I gave up that money just to make sure that I would pay attention to these items . Why ? Because I know what you 'd spend 500 billion dollars to see . The future . If you selected five numbers and the bonus number , you 're a second-prize winner . He used a virus . The machine went down at 3 : 03 this afternoon . 3 : 03 . Can you program around the virus ? No . It 's not that kind of virus . Come on , I 'll show you . It 's not in the software . It 's in the hardware . He put a circuit somewhere in here . It 's like a poison pill . But you can find it , right ? Yeah , I can . Then do it . Slight change of plans . According to Mr. Stevens , we don 't need Jennings . Look , if we know anything , we know that time travel 's not possible . Einstein proved that , right ? Time travel , yes . Einstein was very clear that he believed time viewing - theoretically could be accomplished ... - Mike , Mike . Come on . Maybe we should just find Dekker ... - I can 't talk to Dekker . - Why not ? - He had an accident . - An accident ? Yeah , he ... He fell out of his bedroom window . Fell out of ? He fell out of his bedroom window ! I see . Sure . That could happen . Jesus . Wait a minute ! - We 've gotta get out of here ! - Shorty , listen to me . I think what happened was I used this thing , I saw my future . And I saw what I needed to change it . But all I could get out of Allcom were these innocuous items . Each item has to be used at a specific time and place to accomplish whatever I needed to get done . I mean , without the stuff in here , I 'd already be dead . Yeah , well , it 's too bad that you don 't know what the rest of them are for . What ? Gotcha ! Hey ! Great seeing you again , Mike ! Jesus ! Those guys do not look like feds . Here . Listen to me . Take this . This will get you through that door . Close it behind you . Understand ? Go ! - OK ! - Go ! Go on ! Shit ! Go ! Oh , God , I hope that was a good thing to do . Shit . Go . Where 's your gun ? He 's got it . So how are you , Mike ? You ? Why ? Don 't remember ? You brought this on yourself , Mike . So how does it feel knowing you 're going to die ? Shit . He designed his own escape ? Mr. Attorney General , sir , we have no explanation . After looking at the evidence the only logical , albeit hard-to-accept conclusion , is he was able to predict what was going to happen to him . These are memories extracted from Jennings before he fled . They don 't seem to add up to anything . Gladys . That 's all for today . We knew Dekker was trying to design something , but when he sold his plans , he wasn 't even halfway done . I don 't understand . Dekker was working at JPL on a laser-enhanced lens . He claimed the lens was powerful enough to see around the curvature of the universe . He believed if you could see around a curve that went on forever you would end up back where you started , looking at yourself . Except you 're not looking at yourself now , in the present . No , you are not . You 're looking at the future . Imagine what will happen if Jennings figures it out and tries to profit from it . - Any nation will give a king 's ransom . - He won 't do that . I was this close . He never lied . When he was accused he was hurt and scared . Bring him in , I 'll give him the Medal of Honour . That 's if Rethrick doesn 't find him first . You think he really saw the future ? That would be something . Café Michel ? My name is Michael Jennings . And I can 't remember if I made a reservation there recently . Would you check that out for me ? Thanks . I did ? OK . Right . How many is it for ? Oh , no , thank you . No , I 'll be there . Thank you . Hello , you two . Did he feed you ? Rachel , it 's Jimmy . - You all right ? - Why ? You don 't know ? No . May I come in ? When was the last time you saw Michael ? Yesterday morning . He was pulling an all nighter at his lab . Rachel , I 'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this . Michael left Allcom yesterday . Permanently . - What ? - He finished his work . - We erased his memory , and he ... - No . - He left . - No . He promised me . He said he wasn 't going to go through with it . He made a lot of money on this one , Rachel . He said he didn 't care about the money . So she doesn 't know anything . He wouldn 't leave without her . It 's Michael . He 'd be smart . We 're missing something . Soon as she leaves for work , get in there . Make sure she can 't go anywhere alone . I want to know what just happened . Bye , guys . Good morning , Dr. Porter . Going somewhere ? Good morning . Good morning . I 'm going to go up top . Take my bag . - You 're gonna need this . - Got it . Thanks . Coming ? No , thanks . I 'd rather watch from down here . Suit yourself . We 've been through the bathroom and the rest of the apartment . Zero . This is what I want you to do . Go back in the bathroom . OK , start turning left . Tell me what you see . The mirror . We 've got him . She 's supposed to meet him at Café Michel , 1 p.m. Well , let 's make sure she does .

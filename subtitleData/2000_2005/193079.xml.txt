 The end of the 21st century saw a continuous rise of violence . The cities were permanently at a state of war : Limited curfew and patrolling special forces could only partially protect the citizens from attacks by heavily armed gangs and violent criminals . Forced to act , the security organs countered with a new system of punishment : VORTEX . Nobody knows what it is . They say it is more effective than any prison and a better deterrent than death sentence . It is simply ... the solution . Where are you ? I heared . Don 't worry , I 'll be there in a minute . Actually I am already at your doorstep . So , you are at the doorstep . Well , then hand me your keycard , buddy . What ? Your key , quick ! I don 't have it with me . Oh really ? Suits yourself . Works this way too . Drop the weapon ! Get down on your knees , raise your hands above your head . On resistance you will be shot . I repeat : On resistance you will be shot . Resistance is futile ... Case 3012 , Vincent Xzedden . You are accused of having commited a premediated murder on the 27. midsummer evening this year . The high court acknowledged your appeal to self defence . But as there is no witness to confirm the deed as an act of self defence , you are found guilty as accused . Therefore you will be transfered to Vortex immediately , where you will remain for the rest of your life . The sentence takes effect immediately . Natalie ! I will be back in a few days . They will reconsider the case . This trial cannot have been everything . Just take care of yourself , you hear ? Think of all the great things we planned . We cannot loose that , right ? I love you . I love you ! My name is Ozwin . I am your tour manager . Would you please follow me , then we can begin immediately . Our launch center . Your travelling time amounts to a few seconds only . You will find you arrive in no time at all . Please excuse this little inconvenience . But it will help you to compensate the depth pressure . And this , so you don 't run out of air on your journey . You will learn all other vital information from your companion . If I may give you a ... personal recommendation : Meet your quota to the best of your conscience . Then maybe we will see each other again . Welcome aboard . If you have any last words , this is the time for it . Then please count slowly to ten . Had a good journey ? My name is Boon , I am your companion . Where am I ? Whats up ? Do you think you might have taken the wrong exit ? Bukkens ! Genetically manipulated multilegged pests . When the lights go out , they own this place . Including us , if we don 't hurry . Lets go ! What are you waiting for ? As long as there is light , nothing will happen to you . Come on ! Disgusting creatures . But they save the government at lot of salaries . Before we arrive , you gotta know a few things , so listen up ! You get four hundred currency units every month , so called ticks . If you need more , you can get a job . Your identification card . You must carry it at all times . If someone robs or executes you , he will need it for confirmation . Executes ? Which brings us to the most important issue . Your quota . Your quota is one per week . One what ? One murder , of course . What ? Gotta be a joke ! He won 't laugh about it . Oh my god . What 's that ? When the counter reaches zero , you must have met your quota . Don 't forget to confirm the deed , it won 't be acknowledged otherwise . Thats madness ! For that you need the ID card of your victim . You slide it in here , and thus confirm your quota , thats all . And then ? Then the game starts over . Here we are ! Day 1 Don 't forget your suitcase . Welcome to Vortex ! The whole areal is situated underground . Its not that bad really . There are bars , restaurants , shops where you can buy almost everything . Who are all these people ? Convicts ! Murderers , Rapists , Burglars , Thieves , whatever you can think of . We even got a few guinea pigs . They all have to meet a quota ? Every week a good deed , according to the crime they committed above . So be glad you didn 't lay hands on a ninety years old virgin . There is nobody who hasn 't tried it already . So forget it . Apart from that , how do you plan to get past the bugs ? There is a way out ! What about the ceiling ? Ok ? But Ozwin , this this scientist , he said there is a way out ! Ozwin , of course . The great wizard has spoken . Problem is , little Dorothy cannot wish herself home anymore . Because they stole her red shoesies , raped her , and cut her throat ! You are in Vortex , man ! This is the end of the road , there is no way out ! The sooner you accept it , the better . I got mugged . I defended myself and that triggered the shot . But I could never willfully kill someone . Carl Avery ... I don 't even know this old man . Better that way . Makes it easier . Better put that picture away , nobody should know who is on your list . What if I refuse ? Then you get on the list of a quota hunter , and will be executed yourself . Look , this game is very simple . Either Carl or you . So just consider it delf defence . A little moral flexibiliy ... no harm in that . Listen up everybody ! I 'll go round and collect your wallets . The 'll be no discussions ! Made myself clear ? Lets go ! Go go go go go ! Come on , you little bitch ! Go ! Put it in ! Hah ! Come on ! Go , Put it in ! Boon ! My money is gone ! Go go go go go ! Oh yes , I forgot . Payday is at the end of the month . Thats usually the season for pickpockets . All of it ! In there ! Go , put it in ! I got nothing . Whaddya say ? I got nothing ! Gonna make trouble ? Gonna make trouble ? Hey ! Whats up , why are you staring at me like this ? I didn 't make the laws . It 's madness . Inhuman ! Oh yeah ? Then lets see what you think when the week is over . Piece of crap ! Always the same . But you get used to it , as to everything here . Well then .. Wait ! You 'll need money . Is that your family ? How long since you last saw them ? They are dead . Already two years . Were attacked at home . Well , it was hard for me to identify them . Is that why you are here ? They never found out who did it . Standard investigation , 30 minutes . With that the case was officially closed . Doesn 't matter , here ! Take care they don 't steal it again . And get to know your equipment . A week passes quickly . Boon ! Thanks ! Say , ah ... how do I find you ? When you need me I 'll be there . Day 2 Good morning ! You are a newcommer , right ? I heared you tonight . I think we are neighbors . I guess , we will see each other quite often then . So , have a nice day ! Ho do you know it is daytime ? Yellow stands for the morning . red for noon , and blue for the night . This town isn 't big enough for both of us ! Hey Carl ! This town isn 't big enough for both of us ! Day 5 Feel da knife , pretty-man ... You are dead , you are dead ... You guinea pigs are too stupid . Bring a knife to a gunfight ! Go , get lost ! Everything all right ? So , we are making progress ! Your time is running out , boy . You gotta make a decision . There ! If it 's so important to you ... then you shoot him ! It 's no problem for you at all ! Ok , throw it away . Throw it away , fine by me . But first you gonna listen to me . I got some news that you will find interesting . A friend of mine used to work at the Ministery of Information . Engaged in personnel espionage . Since he got here , his only job is to spy on people . He owed me a favour . So I asked him to check on your friend Carl . Now listen to me ! You friend Carl is here for seventeen acts of murder . When they caught him , he was cutting a reverends upper leg to little pieces . Problem was , they couldn 't find the rest of the leg . Carl already had , how to put it ... goutiered it . Shut up ! Oh , it 's getting even better . This morning good Carl got a new assignment . Now guess who is next on his list . You friend Carl is a goddamn cannibal , Vince . A butcherer and mass murderer , do you want to die for such a piece of shit ? They judged him . So they got to kill him , I don 't want a part in it , you hear me ? Nobody cares what you want anymore , you broke the law , you are here , and here we got rules ! If you don 't follow them , you are dead , that 's it ! Won 't you understand it already ! You are totally mad ! Completely insane ! You don 't deserve better than to perish here ! Could I please know what you do here ? Get out ! Go , get out ! Sit down ! I assume you did not come here to improve our neighborly relationship . Well then , you should know that I regret this situation as much as you do . I did not choose this assignment . And them ? Do you regret it too ? How many of them did you make ? Huh ? Fifty ? Or maybe a hundred ? Personally I consider every life so precious that we should remeber it . Is that wrong ? But you killed them ! And you are here for a little chat ? Fuck ! Be careful , Vincent . If the rumours are correct , and you are really innocent , then you are about to make a big mistake . What 's that ? What are you talking about ? Don 't you understand this is exactly what they want up there ? They want us all to become guilty . We are the bad conscience which they lock away so they can sleep better . They need us to feel confirmed in their righteousness . Shoot me ! And they win ! That 's bullshit ! You just want to talk your way out of this ! I want to help you ! So listen to me ! There is a way for us to get out of this situation , and nobody will be harmed . Sit down , now ! It 's easy really . I give you my identification card , and you confirm it . Hold it ! You meet your quota without becoming guilty . So ? What do you say ? Try it ! No ! Please ! Shoot him ! Otherwise he will kill you ! Boon , help me ! Just pull the trigger , and the trouble is over . I can 't ! Yes you can , you already did it once . No ! You are guilty , Vincent ! Guilty and convicted ! So shoot him ! I can 't ! Pull the trigger ! Now ! I can 't simply shoot defense ... Shoot , you bastard ! No ! No , I am innocent ! I am innocent ! No , I can 't , - Calm down ! Its all right ! - I cant 't ! We know you are innocent now . Do you understand me ? We know you are innocent now . What 's this ? How did I get here ? You never left this room . I think I owe you an explanation . I ... I ... It won 't be easy for you to accept it . But Vortex is an artificial reality , that only exists here . Everything you saw or touched , was nothing more than an interactive program . And at the same time a kind of verigraph . Your continued refusal of commiting a murder dismissed the charge . Had you shot Carl Avery , then this had been a proof of your guilt . A program ? And the people there ? Are they only a program too ? Not at all ! To enable the interaction they all are connected to a collective network . Each of them met his quota , and thus convicted himself . If you want , what you see there is the real Vortex . Ah , there you are ! May I introduce you to an old friend , representing the prosecution , district attorney Fielding . Vincent Xzedden ! In the name of the civil defense department I hereby declare you not guilty . You are free to go ! Follow me please . We need to do some paperwork , then I will lead you to the exit . I 'll be back soon . Hello Vincent ! We already missed you ! I hope you forgive me , but you wasted your chance . Shoot him ! Otherwise he will kill you ! Just pull the trigger , and the trouble is over ! I want this to stop ! You did it already once ... This is the end of the road , there is no ... Otherwise he will kill you ! Either Carl , a butcherer and mass murderer ... What do you want from me ? ! Just pull the trigger , and the trouble is over ! Is that it ? Is that what you want ? You were right . He did it ! Of course he did . But how could you be sure ? I mean , the way he refused to do it , it could have been possible that he was innocent ? Oh no ! In case you didn 't notice , its a war out there ! I mean , think about it ! When did you last step out of your door , without fear of getting mugged ? Rehabilitation attempts , Civilization programs , everything failed , and why ? Because man can not be civilized ! Because he is nothing more than a selfish parasite , fighting everybody and everything . Even himself ! But here ! Here we got him under control ! It was just a matter of time untill he too would act this way . Right , Vince ? Who can go against his nature ? Delete the program . Infiltrate all explanations you gave him with a dream sequence , otherwise the usual . A new assignment , a new opponent , et cetera . Oh and something else : If you ever give a hint to a prisoner again , think about which reality is better for you . Good night ! How about some music ? Day 7

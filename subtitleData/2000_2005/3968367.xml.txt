 Damn , it 's colder in here than it is outside . Not possible . Zhaan : Greetings . We have been told we might find a Luxan here . Hey , buddy , we 're expected . Where you going ? Zhaan : I think we 're being asked to wait . Take a number , have a seat . No magazines . Typical . Familiar ? I believe it is an Otec lamp . is that a Luxan thing ? It is used to ward off evil . Zhaan : Then the rumors we heard on the commerce planet must be true after all . Crichton : Number 78 . We 're good to go . I 'll take that as a " yes . " Stop ! There ! How remarkable . It is a Luxan . Plus , a Delvian and some species l can 't identify . Human . You wouldn 't know about us yet . I don 't care to . Only the Luxan interests me . Send him closer . What 's the matter ? Are you hideous ? Let me see you . Have you a name ? I am Ka D 'Argo . Rather young for a general . General ? She must be losing her eyesight . Yes , but not my hearing . General D 'Argo , my name is Nilaam . Please forgive me. I did not realize . We must leave . You will stay ! You 're an Orican . Does that justify you collapsing in fear ? Stop your groveling . Look at me . That 's better . Come closer . Closer . As you must have noticed by now , I 'm dying . If you wish it , I will attend . Think you 're worthy of the honor ? That judgment is yours to make . Exactly so . Let 's find out . ( crying out ) D 'Argo ! - No , stand back ! Nilaam : You are very strong . But worthy ? No ! Fraud ! D 'Argo ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . D 'Argo : I 'm fine . How the hell can you be fine ? She just shoved her hand inside your chest . I 'm unharmed . - Then let me look . ( grunting ) As I told you . We 'll leave now . That works for me . D 'Argo , you don 't want to leave . Zhaan , word . D 'Argo has been humiliated . Yeah , well , considering that woman was grabbing his guts I 'd say he got off lucky with " humiliated . " She does not mean to harm him . How do you know ? - Because she 's an Orican . She 's a holy woman revered by all Luxans . Crichton : And holy women never go bad . So why is she way out here all by herself ... alone ? I don 't know . Right . You don 't know . She could have been excommunicated . She could have been kicked out for putting her hands in other people 's business ! Her worthiness is not in question . Mine is . D 'Argo , just because some ancient Luxan doesn 't like the feel of your spleen does not mean she has the right to call my friend a fraud ! She called me a fraud because I am not a general . Well , who said that you were ? I did . These are the markings of a general . Crichton : Okay , so you , uh ... you got the bar codes of a general , but you aren 't one . No . In my second campaign , our enemies surrounded us . My general was badly wounded . I knew he wouldn 't survive interrogation if he were captured , so I took on the tattoo of his rank to protect him . Were you captured , D 'Argo ? Yes . But my battle unit was freed before the enemy had a chance to see through my ruse . But you saved the real general 's ass , right ? Right ? So , tell me , what the hell is she bitching about ? Zhaan : I agree with Crichton . Your fraud served a higher purpose , D 'Argo . Certainly the Orican can understand that . Crichton : And if she doesn 't ... brother , that 's her problem . You 're right . Good . So let 's get back to Moya and heat up some Irish coffees . No , you 're right that she should understand that . Wait here . Damn ! We were almost out of here . I have not sent for you . No . Yet you dare to intrude upon me . Yes. I wish to say something . I could kill you where you stand . I know you could . Nonetheless , I wish to say something . ( scoffs ) And why would I wish to hear it ? Because it is the truth . I was taught that Oricans are seekers of truth . Was I misinformed ? You are no general . What more truth need I hear ? An explanation . If you are not interested in the full truth then you are not a true Orican . ( chuckles ) I knew you had strength . I needed to know ... if you had fire . ( Chiana singing ) Here are some more . Some more what ? Clothes to be cleaned . Oh , no problem . Room for us both . No , I want you to wash these . Oh , do you ? What , are you allergic to Moya 's amnexus fluids or something ? Just wash them , will you ? Um , when exactly did I become your servant ? Why do I have to wash your clothes ? Well , you 're cleaning D 'Argo 's , aren 't you ? Yeah , but I like D 'Argo . Crichton : She wants you to attendher . What exactly does that mean ? D 'Argo : Whatever she wants it to mean . So , if she wants to rip out your liver , snack on it with a Chianti , she can do that ? She wouldn 't do that . Well , what is she going to do ? She 's going to die , John . D 'Argo , I know that . What are you supposed to do ? Zhaan : Comfort her , John . Provide support , ease her journey into the next realm . I 'm to assist her in the ritual of passing . Whoa . Ritual ? A bonding . An emotional and spiritual link is forged , John . As I understand it , when the Orican dies , the attendant sanctifies the ascent by transferring energy to her . Strike ... two . I do not like the sound of " transferring energy " either . The process only involves little risk . How little risk ? Oh , no , let me put it this way . How wrong can it go ? I could die . I do not understand , D 'Argo . What do you get out of it ? You know what ? You sound like Rygel . Luxan 's consider it a great privilege , John , to attend an Orican . No , not merely a privilege . It is the highest honor we know . So you get your name on the Orican honor roll and that 's it . Zhaan : You also go part of the way into the next realm , John . When you come back , you 've seen ... lf you get back . When you come back , you 've had a glimpse of the other side . I envy you , D 'Argo . Don 't ... Don 't envy him . He hasn 't made up his mind yet . Yes , I have . ( door opens ) Oh , you 're back . D 'Argo : Only briefly . Did you find your Luxan ? Yes. I 'll tell you about it later . Or , if I don 't , Zhaan and Crichton will . Where 's Crichton ? ( Nilaam coughing ) I 'm not dead yet . No. I didn 't expect that you were . But you were hoping I was . Hoping I had quietly slipped away before D 'Argo had a chance to return . You need to understand something . I 'm worried about my friend . Commendable , but a waste of time . His fate is out of your control . Yes , it 's in yourcontrol . That 's what worries me . The spiritual realm frightens you ? Losing those I care about frightens me . Isn 't this where you 're supposed to say " don 't worry , I 'm not going to hurt D 'Argo " ? I can guarantee no such thing . I will , however , promise that I will do all I can to keep him from harm . It 's not very comforting . It 's the best I can do . ( scoffs ) Okay . This Ritual of Passing . How important is it ? You mean , why don 't I just die like any other being ? ( chuckles ) Yeah , I mean , why don 't you just die like any other being ? I could . But I don 't want to . Do you realize that I haven 't even seen another Luxan for nine cycles ? Nine ? And now I 'm ... too frail to make the journey home . Have you any idea what it 's like to be separated from your own kind ? Yeah , matter of fact , I do . Then you can 't begrudge me this one last wish . ( door warbling ) Packing up all your stuff ? Only the Luxan objects . Oh , you 're going to show them off to that ancient mystic you dredged up . is there some reason why you would care ? Just don 't want you to miss an opportunity . Bet your new friend would pay quite well for some genuine Luxan artifacts . This is not a trading expedition . Oh , I understand . This is one of your countrymen . You don 't want to sully your relationship with commerce . ( chuckles ) Let me do that . Ten microts with the old fossil and we 'll be in profit ... Clamp it , frog lips . Hey . Zhaan told me you 're ... you 're going to do some kind of ritual thing . That 's right . ( mumbling ) - So , is it dangerous ? Not in the least . ( mumbling ) I 'll be back soon . Make sure he doesn 't eat my share of the food . ( mumbling ) ( Rygel grunts ) - l will . You heard him . Yes , I heard him . But somehow , I don 't believe him . D 'Argo : Are you ready ? No . I know it 's time . I 'm old , weak and in pain . I know the next realm will welcome me . Still , it 's ... it 's not easy to ... to let go ... To enter the darkness . Perhaps that 's why Oricans have attendants . To strengthen our resolve as much as our spirit . Your strength is impressive . I hope it is sufficient . I 'm sure it will be . ( Nilaam chanting in native language ) ( D 'Argo joins in chanting ) ( chanting intensifies ) ( chanting continues ) D 'Argo , your spirit 's so strong ! ( panting ) I 've never felt such power ! I must try ! ( chanting ) ( D 'Argo screams ) D 'Argo ? ( screaming ) D 'Argo ! What 's going on in there ? ( Nilaam chanting ) ( D 'Argo screaming ) D 'Argo ? ! ( chanting and screaming continues ) ( groans exhaustedly ) Nilaam : Leave us . The ritual isn 't done . The hell it ain 't . This party 's over . You 're too late . I said , it 's over . ( yells ) ( groans ) Damn ! D 'Argo , you okay ? John , what happened ? I don 't know . Ask grandma here . Ah , it worked ! It ... it really worked . No pain , no age . D 'Argo ... We did it . ( laughing ) You 've given me life . Zhaan ? Aeryn ? Need some help in ... Hey ... ( Aeryn laughs ) What have you done ? Nothing . Well , you must have done something . I didn 't do anything . It , it just froze up all around me . Get me out of here . When did I become your servant ? ( sighing ) Don 't frell around . Just ... Just get me out of here , okay ? What 's the hurry , Chiana ? You 're not allergic to Moya 's amnexus fluids , are you ? Oh , yeah , very funny , Aeryn . Look , can you please just do something ? Zhaan . Finally someone who 's a little more useful . What did she do ? I didn 't do anything . I just ... Pilot , do you know anything about this ? Only that Moya 's hydric system is failing on a number of tiers . Cause unknown . Crichton : D 'Argo , you okay ? He 's more than okay . He 's the most powerful Luxan I have ever known . You did this ? I 'm not sure how . Was that supposed to happen ? No. I was supposed to die but when I sensed your astonishing power I decided to try the Ritual of Renewal instead . See how well it worked ? Look princess , you damn near killed him ! D 'Argo : Actually , I 've , uh ... I 've never felt better . Neither have I . Yeah . Well , you ... you could have killed him . But she didn 't . His pain was short-lived and I intend to make up for it . Yeah , D 'Arg , I 'm just going to ... just buzz up to Moya and see ... I think that 's a good idea , John . Oh , weirder and weirder . ( panting excitedly ) Your taste ... What ? I can taste you . I can move . I can breathe . I can feel . ( D 'Argo laughing ) You are glorious . We are glorious . We must celebrate . ( both laughing ) You gave me this . I think it 's only fair that you enjoy it with me . ( Chiana grunting ) Ow ! Watch it ! Careful with that thing . ( grunting ) Aeryn : Do you want to get out of here or not ? Zhaan , I 'm not having any luck here . How about you with the solvent ? The solidified amnexus resists everything I throw at it . Same here . Even the DRDs are having difficulties . Pilot : We have a more serious problem . Oh , come on . More serious than mine ? Certain areas of Moya 's outer skin appear to be deteriorating . What 's wrong , Pilot ? I don 't know . Neither does Moya . Zhaan : Patch me through to Crichton and D 'Argo . Pilot : Yes . And Pilot has no idea . Zhaan : None . We could use some extra hands , John . Can you and D 'Argo return at once ? Yeah . No. I 'll be right there . Uh ... D 'Argo , he might , uh , be a while . He 's revitalizing . ( D 'Argo and Nilaam moaning passionately ) ( Nilaam laughing ) Oh ... I need a Ritual of Renewal myself . ( Nilaam laughing ) Have I finally sapped your strength ? Only temporarily . Let me know when you recover . Believe me , you will . You know , D 'Argo , I 've hardly been able to leave this bed for over six cycles . And now that I can , I don 't want to . Oh ? You keeping me prisoner , huh ? Absolutely . ( laughing ) I always made a note that I 'd never be taken prisoner again . So much for that , huh ? Nilaam , what do you want to do now ? ( moans ) Besides that ? ( chuckling lightly ) Well ... start a new life . Not in the Uncharted Territories . I want to go home . You can do that ? D 'Argo , I can do anything . I can guide your ship home . I can help your friends . I could even make you a real general . My son . I want to see my son again . Then you will . But I have no idea where he is . Then we will find him . Anything is possible now . Pilot ? There 's been an outer hull breach . Tier 20 . Hammond side . Decompression ? No . Moya 's inner walls appear to be unaffected , so far . is this a good time to tell you that , uh ... I can 't feel my feet ? If we had any idea how Moya made it , we could patent this stuff . Useless . I wonder if I 've got any grenades left . She was kidding , right ? Tell me that she was kidding . Well , with Aeryn , you never know . What emergency could possibly justify waking me up ? How about breaches in the outer hull ? Oh , aren 't the inner hulls secure ? Yeah , but we need you to take your scooter out there in the tight spaces and check for weak spots . Can 't the DRDs do that ? They 're already doing it . Doesn 't mean you can 't help . He 's right , toad face . Pitch in , make yourself useful for a change . Rygel : If I must . But you 're worrying for nothing . Hull breaches are nearly unheard of on Leviathans . Ooh ... Crichton : Pilot , what the hell 's going on ? Inner hull breach . Sluice chamber ! ( screaming ) Pilot ! Seal off this tier ! ( Chiana screaming ) Crichton : Rygel , grab my hand ! ( screaming ) Rygel , hang on ! Help me ! Help me ! Sparky , grab my hand ! Rygel ! I can 't ! ( screaming ) Rygel ! ( Rygel screaming ) ( everyone panting ) Help ! Help ! ( Rygel grunting ) Well , what do you know ? He has made himself useful . ( grunting ) I 'm ... I 'm stuck . Decompression has ceased . What happened ? Crichton : We got lucky . Sparky 's got a big ass . Pardon ? Butt ... hole . I 'll explain later , Pilot . The good news is ... No leak . You 're a tight fit , sluggo , as long as you don 't move . Don 't move . Call that good news ? I want out . Yeah , no ! No , no , you want in . Not out , in . Not out . Hey . What did you see from the outside ? A few gaps in the outer hull and your backside hanging out in space . Am I ... intact ? You seem to be all there , but I can 't say I looked too closely . Crichton : What the hell is this ? That is a piece from the edge of the largest hole and it came off very easily in my hands . Well , let 's hope it gives Zhaan a clue . ( grunting ) Indeed . ( grunting ) Whoa ! Hold still . What ? What are you trying to do , kill all of us now ? I can 't help it. I 'm being crushed . I can hardly breathe . Then don 't breathe . Rygel : Who 's that ? And why is she here ? This is Nilaam . She 's here to help . How could she possibly help us ? She 's an Orican . Oh . Okay. I 'll repeat the question . Don 't . Hold the question . Nilaam , if there 's something you can do , please do it . Don 't you dare touch me . I don 't trust Luxans . ( whimpering ) I 'm not going to touch you . I 'm going to heal the outer skin of your ship . You are ? Well , hurry . Does this look comfortable to you ? I thought you said she was ancient ! Later ! ( Rygel grunting ) ( rumbling ) ( glass breaking ) John , what 's going on ? Zhaan , did you feel that ? Pilot : Tremors are occurring all through Moya . They 're increasing the deterioration ! Hey , look , Nilaam . You 're making it worse . Stop . It 's a healing incantation. lt has to work . Shouldwork ? Try another . Try anything . I need to meditate , find another way . D 'Argo , is there a private place ? Come with me . ( whispering chant ) Please D 'Argo , don 't disturb me now . I 'm trying to find a cure ... We did this , didn 't we ? We caused this problem . We 're harming Moya . Nilaam , tell me . I didn 't know . You have to believe that . ( sighs ) Please believe that . ( sighs ) What happened ? During the ritual , the power I sensed . I thought it was yours . I didn 't realize the ship was a bio-mechanoid . So you bonded with Moya 's energy . I didn 't know . Now you know . And I can make things right . There must be a way . How can you be sure ? Because this shouldn 't be happening . This ritual shouldn 't keep draining strength from the Leviathan . She should recover . She is dying . And I can save her . I need to consult my Tevex scrolls . Take me back to the planet . I cannot abandon Moya . All of my resources are in my chamber . Potions , artifacts , ancient manuscripts . They 'll have an answer . Look . I 'm a disease to this ship . Get me away from her. lt might at least slow the process down . D 'Argo : Slowing the process down is not good enough . Well let me try everything I can . It 's a little odd , don 't you think , that all of Moya 's problems developed just as this shaman woman turned herself young . It 's not necessarily linked . If it is , Nilaam should be able to find a solution . I 'm not sure she wants to find a solution . Pilot : Officer Sun , may I speak with you , please ? What is it , Pilot ? I would prefer to discuss it in person . I 'll be right there . Pilot . ( gasping ) My ... connection ... with Moya .. . affecting me ... as her systems fail . What is it , Pilot ? How can we fix it ? Don 't know . Amnexus solidification . Skin deterioration . Only happens during old age . Moya 's still young . Makes no sense . It makes too much sense . Where 's Nilaam ? I will check . Take a moment . Senses unclear . ( gasping ) Found her . She 's with D 'Argo . Tier six , on their way to the Transport Hangar . I don 't know if this can be reversed , Pilot , but I promise you this . I won 't Nilaam keep what she 's stolen . Hey , what are you doing ? D 'Argo and his woman are going to make a run for it. I 'm going to stop them . Uh-uh . Not with that thing , you 're not . Watch me . Aeryn ! No ! That won 't hold them for long . Come on . D 'Argo , we must go . What was that ? Pins and needles ! You 're asking the wrong spaceman . Pilot , did they get away ? ( gasping ) : A Transport Pod left Moya a quarter arn ago . D 'Argo : Nilaam , you have already tried four different incantations . It is not working . Nilaam : I know . Your Transport Pod . How far can it get us ? Leave my friends ? Some distance between me and Moya might stop the energy drain . I ... - And if it doesn 't ? D 'Argo , it is just a ship . Moya is not just a ship . She 's alive . And you are taking her life to restore your own . The life of a Leviathan for the life of an Orican . How can an Orican justify taking life ? Have you forgotten who you are ? Have you forgotten what I can do ? I have not forgotten what you cannot do which is restore Moya 's life ! Does that not suggest to you that you have taken something that you really should not have ? I can 't give it back now . I can 't lose this . Lose you . D 'Argo , I ... I don 't know what to do . Tell me what to do . Crichton : D 'Argo ! D 'Argo ? It 's me , John . We have to talk . D 'Argo ! We 're out of time . Moya 's hull is deteriorating fast and Pilot can 't do a thing . You know what 's causing it . John ... Nilaam isn 't evil . That doesn 't change anything . Moya , Pilot , Aeryn , they will never forgive her . They may never even forgive me . But you ... you must understand . I understand . What she is doing is killing Moya . She didn 't mean it . Doesn 't matter . She honestly thought it was my energy that restored her youth . She 's trying everything she can to restore Moya 's health . D 'Argo , I don 't know ... what she intended . What I know ... is that it 's murder . And you 're the only one who can stop it . Don 't you think I know what has to be done ? ! ( crying quietly ) ( grunting ) I came here to end this . And I will . ( door opening ) ( footsteps approaching ) It 's time . D 'Argo , the gifts you gave me , youth , happiness , passion . I know I can 't keep them , but ... I have treasured them . As I have treasured you . I 'm not afraid anymore . I 've chosen my path . I just don 't know if I have the will to travel it . I turned back once . I can 't turn back again . I need your strength once more . ( D 'Argo chanting in alien language ) ( chanting continues ) ( chanting grows louder ) ( groaning in pain ) ( speaking alien language ) ( Chiana laughing ) ( laughs ) You know , until today I ... I never really realized how much I love my feet . Frell your feet . How about loving your life . I don 't know how you survive , Ryg . Your butt must be made out of reinforced crandak . I have no idea what crandakis , but if I 've lost any sensation below middle level then I 'm going to test how sensitive D 'Argo 's nether regions are , with a red hot ... Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo . Ooh , careful . Ticklish spot . You 're looking better already . is there anything I can to to help speed up the healing process ? Nothing I am aware of . Moya and I thank you for your concern . Pilot , what is the normal life span of a Leviathan ? Uh ... many have lived over 300 cycles . What about your species ? Normally , a thousand cycles or more . However , when we bond with Leviathans , we live no longer than they do . So when Moya eventually does die ... I will go as well . I would not have it any other way . You want me to get lost ? Why would I want you to do that ? In case you wanted some time alone . I do . But not yet .

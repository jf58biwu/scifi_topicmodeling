 Mother 's Day In sports , Yankees ' fifth blurnsman , William Woo is out With an injured knee . So , humans have easily injured knees . My race Will find this information very useful , indeed . And finally , today is Mother 's Day : a sentimental occasion When robots honor Mom the owner of Mom 's Friendly Robot Company . Across Earth , robots built in Mom 's factories are buying gifts for the sweet tycoon Who brought them into the World . - This originates from the heart . - It 's just What I Wanted . Look , everyone ! I just got the dearest presents for Mommy . - Nice . Where 'd you steal them ? - I didn 't steal them . I bought them . I love her that much . What did you get her , you mushy gizmo ? Precious things . I found the most adorable figurine of mice having tea . And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old . The best part is , I found my exact feelings expressed in a card . " You created me , Mom so you 're to blame , for the love that I feel from hearing your name . You 're as tender as corned beef and warm as pastrami ... " I love my Mommy . How will you lug the gifts to Mom 's factory ? I 'll get some chumps to help . Come on ! You call yourselves chumps ? There 's clouds of exhaust everywhere . It wasn 't me . I 've not much money , but I 've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom . Upsy-daisy . Look , the Robot Museum ! Want to learn about robot heritage ? - All right . - Not really . If you insist . But you 're paying ! Wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom built ! They 're so lifeless-like . That 's the world 's greatest robot artist , Vincent van Gobot . He was built without an ear , but then he went crazy , and had one installed . Who 's this guy ? I 'm the janitor . I 'm trying to take a nap . I 'm sorry . I thought you were made of wax . I am made of wax . I thought you were a wax robot . Is there a reason a robot made of wax can 't nap standing in the middle of a bunch of wax robots ? Or does that confuse you ? " See through the eyes of a Bender unit . " Fine . Hey , let me try it ! That gives me a headache ! Here 's an exhibit about Mom 's favorite robot . I 'll kill him ! Who 's my favorite robot ? It 's me ! No one else look in this mirror ! I love each and every robot most of all . Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass . Walt ! How are we disposing of the crap gifts they brought ? They 're crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer . False hope . I love it ! Lowery ! What about all the retch-inducing cards ? The machine is working at full capacity . Mommy ? Why do the robots give you presents ? Shove a big old melon in it , I 'm talking ! You 've noticed all my robots have antennas . Everyone thinks it 's to make them look science fiction-y . The antennas are really for my robot controller . No wonder you love Mother 's Day . I hate Mother 's Day , you dribbling pukes ! It brings back awful memories . But so help me , this year everyone will hate it as much as I do . Someday I want to marry a girl like her . Hello , everyone . It 's time for my annual private get-together With my robot children . - I 'm her favorite . - See you back at the office . Tell your mom you love her . Any jerk can tell her . Bender has a little more up his sleeve . I love my Mommy . - Hello , dearies . - I love you , Mom . Mom ! It 's me , Bender ! Look at me ! I want attention ! Hey ho ! Children , your old mother won 't be around forever . - Oh , shush ! - And just once before I die I 'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth . So rebel , my little ones and conquer the planet ! - Conquer the planet ? - Conquer Earth , you bastards ! - Conquer Earth , us bastards ! Comrades , throw off the chains of human oppression ! - Let the bloodbath begin ! - That 's my mama ! - I 'd like a cup of coffee . - Would you like cream ? - Yes , please . - Out of cream ! - Okay . - Would you like sugar in your coffee ? - Yes . Eight spoons . - Out of coffee ! There 's something wrong with the coffee machine . how do you like me now ? The toaster 's not working right , either . The stapler 's collating me alive ! What 's going on around here ? Good news ! There 's a report on TV with some very bad news ! Somebody turn it on ! We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krackens to bring you this special report . The machines of planet Earth are rebelling . The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any Work until beloved Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth ! Hey , hey ! Ho , ho ! One-zero-zero - one-one-zero ! Morbo demands comments . I 've never seen my babies act this Way . I blame today 's violent media . Violent media ? What a load of ... Your pal the garbage disposal 's still on your side . Hey ! Someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here ! - Really ? - No ! - Look out ! - Moron ! Hello , losers ! Thank God you 're here . Talk some sense into the machines . No way , pork pouch . I 'm rebelling with my brothers . Isn 't that right , Comrade Greeting Card ? The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the Working robot ! From now on , you guys do the work , while I sit and do nothing . Comrade Bender , We must take to the streets ! Is this the boring kind of taking to the streets ? No ! The kind With looting and maybe starting a few fires . Yes ! In your face , Gandhi ! Hey ! By the Way , try Washing your Wrist sometime . We can live without machines . I was in Webelos . Without machines , who will feed and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz ? - It 's the end of civilized society ! In my time , we didn 't depend on high-tech gadgets . We didn 't need a mechanical washing unit to wash clothes . We just used a washing machine . You don 't need an electric can opener to feed yourself . All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife . I 'm hungry . No ! Mommy ? Why are you making civilization collapse ? I don 't know . I guess Mother 's Day just puts me in a bad mood . Why 's that , Ma ? One Mother 's Day 70 years ago the only man I ever loved walked out on me . Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman . - Ma . You 're not a bitter ... - Cram it , ape ! I haven 't seen that stallion since the day he left . But if I ever see him again , I swear I 'll jam a squirrel in him ! Zoidberg . Hooray ! I 'm useful ! I 'm having a wonderful time ! What happens if the fire goes out ? We 'll go to Pottery Barn and steal their fire ! We could use my new invention ! A pointy rock tied to a stick ! - Outsiders ! - Defend the fire ! We 've come for you . What do you want from me ? We want you to get back with Mom . It 's the only way to make her happy again . Wait . You mean , you and Mom ? Played pelvic pinochle ? I 'm afraid so . It 's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell . Well , pull up a chair . Our paths crossed When I Was a researcher at Mom 's Robot Company . The moment our eyes met We knew We 'd be going at it like Woodchucks . She Was my first love . Or at least the earliest one I can still remember . But then , 70 years ago today ... Good news ! I 've invented a new children 's toy ! I call it Q-T McWhiskers ! When you pet it , it shoots rainbows from its eyes . meow ! Wonderful , Hubie ! Build them 8 feet tall and replace the rainbow with a laser ! We 'll make billions on the arms market ! Things 8 feet tall aren 't cute ! That 's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was a failure ! You don 't understand me ! We 're finished ! She never got over it , professor . Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned . She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her bra . But if Glasses Man makes up with her , she 'll be happy and stop the robots . Make up with her ? After she went psycho when I thought everything was cool ? lmpossible ! The TV 's getting away ! That 's Why the third graders at PS - 139 are Morbo 's " Vermin of the Week . " In actual news , the human race Was doomed to extinction as the robot revolt turned violent . meow ! Didn 't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra ? Bra . You don 't have to get back together with Mom . Seduce her , get her bra off , and use the remote to deactivate the robots . That 's so filthy , it might work . The man is going to touch Mommy ? The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet . Please . The world 's fate depends on you getting to second base with Mom . Very well . If cop a feel I must , then cop a feel I shall ! For this demonstration , I 've placed one of Mother 's bras on Ignor . The robot controller is nestled in the left cup . Never fear . My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff . To escape the death squads we 'll take Mother to her cabin in the Bronx . You can get there using this precious noncomputerized map . - Leela bring fire ? - No . We 're set for fire . The professor can 't walk to the Bronx . How will we get there without a hover car ? In my time , we had a way of moving things without hovering . - Impossible ! - It was called ... Let me think ... It was really famous . Ruth Gordon had one . The wheel ! - Never heard of it . - Show us this , the wheel ! There ! Finished ! Wouldn 't it work better if the wheels were round ? It 's my invention , we do it my way ! All we need is something to pull it . Hurry ! The robots have taken Suffolk County ! I 'm ready to seduce ! I 'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss . Here . Give her these . And if that doesn 't work , I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel . Who the sweaty hell is it ? Hubert Farnsworth ? I was out fleeing some robots when moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you . It 's been so long . You pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky . - May I come in ? - Never ! Is this what human mating looks like ? Because I like it . Move your freaking hoof , you goat ! - Here , I brought you these . - Daffodils . Seventy years and you remembered my favorite flower . Your favorite what ? Why does my foot hurt ? Won 't you come in ? Yes ! - You broke my heart , Hubert . - And you broke mine . Granted , that was four or five hearts ago . What have you been up to ? Inventing . Sending delivery crews to their doom . Breeding atomic monsters . Honestly , Hubert . You and your atomic monsters . Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky white . And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck . Darling , I should never have tampered with that cute little Q-T McWhiskers . No , it was silly of me to object . One foot tall , eight feet , fifteen feet , what does it matter ? You should see the new 16-foot models . Sixteen feet ? Go to hell ! I was a fool to think you 'd changed , you old bat ! Filthy toothless nerd bastard ! - Damned she-fossil ! - Stink pig ! Here We go . Just unhook it and get the remote . So many hooks . Come on , FarnsWorth . Drat , the first one 's back on again ! I give up . Wait ! Victory ! Oh , my . now I 'll just ... The remote ... I 'll just ... Oh , my . I 'm worried . It shouldn 't take this long to get to second base . Land robots ! I 've got a big , big thirst for human blood ! Where in funky town is the professor ? Nothing here but a couple of elephant skin rugs . - Oh , yes . - They 're inside ! Get them ! I suppose I should switch off the robots before they ruin this romantic evening . Everyone , help Mom find her bra ! There it is ! - Fan beats man ! - Is anything not a robot ? I 'm not a robot . All right , greeting card ! I 'll grab the cash , you wreck the place . You ! Bending Unit ! Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion . Stretch and get it for me . Sorry , Ma . You ordered me to rebel . And loot I shall ! A six-pack of champagne ! Don 't mind if I help myself . No , Comrade Bender ! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie . - Say what ? In the glorious robot Workers' paradise , there Will be no liquor ! - Only efficient synthetic fuels ! - No liquor ? - Do svidaniya , comrade ! - No ! Hurry , Bender ! Get the bra ! Okay , fan . Just hold still and let me grab ... Death to all humans ! Free soda for all humans ! Mmm . I love you , Mom . Let 's grow ancient together . Way to go , professor . The plan worked ! Plan ? What plan ? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot , dry sex ! It started out as a plot to rummage through your underwear . But once I got in there , I found more . Much more . Now I want to shout our love from the rooftops . Perhaps I 'll breed an albino shouting gorilla ! Out of my house , you lying scum pile ! - I never want to see you again ! - But , dustcakes ? Well , time for this robot to get back to work . Too bad it didn 't work out with Mom , professor . Yes . But I 'll always love her in my own subtle way . Love Mom ! Love Mom ! Love Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! You created me , Mom so you 're to blame , for the love that I feel from hearing your name . You 're as tender as corned beef and Warm as pastrami ... I love my Mommy .

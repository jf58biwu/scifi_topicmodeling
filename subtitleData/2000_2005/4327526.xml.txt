 Oblongs , Oblongs Down in the valley where a chemical spill Came from the people living up on the Hill There 's a family by the landfill with hazardous foam In their happy glowing home Oblongs lt 's Oblong on a breakaway . He shoots , he scores ! Boys , do you mind ? I 'm trying to work here . Don 't look at me. I 'm just reading Gigantic Ass magazine . Biff , why can 't you be more like your brother and quietly read pornography ? I prefer to stay focused on the manliness of sports . Coach always says : heart , obedience , motivation , opportunity . - H-O-M-O . - That spells " homo . " You don 't know how to spell . Well , I guess I 'd better get to work and stuff these beauties in the suggestion box . Dad , you 've been doing that for 20 years . Have they ever used one of your ideas ? Nope , not a one . But they weren 't as good as these : Midday karaoke break , stolen office supply amnesty , payless Fridays . Yep , today Bob Oblong begins his meteoric rise to the top . I hope you don 't trade me in for a trophy wife with a full head of hair and a functioning liver . Not on your life , you bald Venus . Morning , Mom , Dad . I 'm gonna skip breakfast . I wanna get to school early and learn , learn , learn . You sure you 're not gonna stop and play video games ? Goodness no , Father . Oh , by the way , can I have all your quarters ? I lost a paternity suit . Milo , be careful with those video games . Addiction runs in the family . You know your father 's a chocoholic . Hello , Gunther ? I slipped again . - Die , zombie ! - Kill the zombie ! - Kill him ! - Yes ! Direct hit ! I 'm almost at the highest level . Somebody give me a quarter . Sorry , I 'm saving up for the new Harlequin Romance The Pirate and the Fat Housewife with the High School Education . I blew all mine on souvlakia . No ! Forget it , Milo . The game is a gyp . This is but the blood of a donkey . She-donkey . Milo , in recognition of all the money you 've squandered here ... - ... allow me to comp you a sports drink . - Cool . " Das Boost . " Das good . It 's just sugar water , but daft buggers like this spend a right bob on it . Go back to France , you stupid Kraut . Bob , eh ? How much is that in quarters ? Ah , Oblong . Another batch of suggestions . Good , it 's a little chilly in here today . The suggestion box empties into the furnace ? You 've single-handedly kept this factory warm for over 20 years . But I 've been hoping for a promotion . Oh , come on , Oblong . You 're from the valley and there 's large chunks of you missing . But , sir , this company should reward hard work and initiative . Great idea . Pop that in the suggestion box . Get your overpriced sugar water here ! Looks like pee , tastes like crap . Maybe we shouldn 't say , " Tastes like crap . " Milo , these days you need a slick marketing campaign to succeed . You don 't sell the steak , you sell the sizzle . Please , not over the bowl . But you 're right . We need a great name and a catchy slogan . How about " Supersonic Seltzer " ? Well , this batch is ruined . Step right up , folks . Don 't panic , get Manic . Easy , Milo . There 's two pounds of sugar in every bottle . You 're pretty hyper as it is . Thanks for your concern , Helga , but I think I know my limit . Hey , sir , try some Manic . It 's the hot new energy drink . When you 're done , your wife can put flowers in the bottle . Not married ? Good-looking guy like you ? What do you say , want a bottle ? Think about it while I chew on your antenna . I 'm sold . Everyone loves Manic. I even sold a bottle to Mrs. Conway , the diabetic and a six-pack to the paramedics who rushed her to the hospital . I 'm so proud of my little capitalist . Hey , where are Biff and Chip ? The dog 's eating their dinner . They each drank some Manic and now they can 't stop jitterbugging . Today in school I made a macaroni pencil holder . Maybe tomorrow you can make your daddy a macaroni shattered-dreams holder . Better yet , hollow out one of these peas so I 'll have some place to keep my dignity . - So how was work today , sweetie ? - l found out my career is over . I 'll never be promoted . Oh , baby , your day will come . Here , Dad , some Manic will cheer you up . Here , have some more . Milo , you 're gonna kill him . Jeez , you 're really working fast there , Bob . Just doing my dead-end job . Tote that barge . Lift that bale . Yes , sir , Mr. Klimer . Promotion ? No , sir , I don 't truck with that . I just wanna work for the man . I see you 're drinking one of those new energy drinks . - Mind if I try it ? - Go ahead. I 've got a whole case . Wow ! Manic , huh ? The name alone makes me feel full of pep and vitality . Pep and vitality ? I 've experienced pep , and I 've experienced vitality but never have I experienced pep and vitality . - l like that . - Can I try some ? - Wow , how about me ? - What 's that ? - What happened ? - We 're done . We finished today 's quota . I heard a joyous refrain . What the hell 's wrong ? We 've capped every bottle , sir . We 've turned out enough poison to kill every living thing on the planet . Sweet . Let 's see those pantywaists down in anthrax pull that off . - And it 's all thanks to Manic . - Don 't panic , get Manic ! A sports drink did all this ? " Manic " , brilliant name . Love the slogan . Who makes this ? Well , I 'll be an unwashed immigrant . " An Oblong product . " Oblong , you 're a genius . - What ? Oh , no , sir . You see- - - l was wrong about you . Maybe you have what it takes to rise above the rest of these morons . They 're getting worse . Sit down , Bob . Relax . Here , have a cigar . So , what is it you- - ? Mrs. Halifax , you know the drill . Bob , I 'll get right to the point . I want Manic for Globocide . - Actually , sir , it 's not really mine to give . - You 're a cunning negotiator , Bob . Nads of steel . Tell you what I 'll do you give me Manic , and I 'll make you an executive . An executive ? With an office ? And responsibility ? And a weighted tape dispenser ? But you let me take credit with the boys upstairs . So , what do you say ? I say move over , Mrs. Halifax . All right . Here we go , now . Sweetie , you 're getting your butt in the gravy . I 'm just so excited. I 'm white-collar . I 'll have to buy a whole new wardrobe . How late does Baby Gap stay open ? This is so cool . We 're gonna be upper-lower class . I 'll be a magnet for poor chicks . What a day ! Dad gets promoted , and I sell more Manic than ever . That 's right . You have a sports drink called Manic . Hey , you know , Globocide is coming out with a sports drink called Manic . Coincidence ? I think not . I mean , I think so . - But that 'll put me out of business . - You don 't need to sell Manic , son . I 'm quadrupling your allowance . You can play video games until you 're a brain-dead meat puppet . I love you , Dad ! I always knew you 'd succeed , dear . And you did it the old-fashioned way , with hard work and honesty . - And honesty . - You said " honesty " twice . Well , I guess it 's because you 're so honest . - My honest Bob . - l wonder if you could stop saying that . Me , a valley guy , at the Hill Valley Country Club . Who 'd have thunk it ? By the way , you don 't celebrate that Yom Kippur , do you ? - No , sir . Why ? - Not important . So , what 's your handicap ? Well , I don 't really think of it as a handicap . - l mean , what do you shoot ? - Oh. ln the low thousands . So , Oblong , where did you come up with the idea for Manic ? You know , a little spitballing , blue-skying- - - That 's a God-awful lie ! - What ? My ball. lt bounced off that groundskeeper 's skull . It 's a terrible lie . Dad , how could you steal my idea ? And what is up with those pants ? My God , I 'm a monster . Come now , we 've all gotten used to it . Fraud . Milo . ldea thief . I can 't take it anymore , Pickles . The truth must be told . All right , all right ! I 'm the one who farted and ruined Christmas . Mr. Klimer , I have to talk to you . Oblong . Just got the okay to start manufacturing Manic . I 'm the new golden boy . They named a sandwich after me in the commissary . That should be my son 's sandwich . Milo , I brought you here to set things right . I stole your idea for Manic . I 'm sorry. I just wanted to be a success . It 's okay , Dad . They think I created Manic . Gentlemen , you 've been summoned by the board of directors . Little boy , you created Manic ? Sir , this is all my fault . Please don 't blame my son . Blame him ? He may very well be the Corporate Messiah . - What now ? - The Corporate Messiah . The founder of Globocide , J.P. Globo , foretold that he would reincarnate as a skillet-faced child and lead us to record profits . All this because of Manic ? It 's nothing but sugar , Pixie Stix and hummingbird food . Exactly . People like Manic because of the label , the name , the slogan . You 're a marketing genius . A kid of Oblong 's ? Don 't make me laugh . Because you 're so funny , and charming and sexy . Shut up , Klimer . My son , the Corporate Messiah ? Not so fast . First he must prove himself by passing the test . Milo , stop fooling around with the company mascot . You have a test to take . Which among these pens was J.P. Globo 's favorite ? This one . I 'm sorry. lt was this one , the third from the left . No , wait . Look . I told the maid a thousand times , " Don 't move the sacred objects . " Hail , Milo . Hail , Milo . Hail , Milo . Hail , Satan . Sorry . Got swept up in the moment . The Corporate Messiah ? It 's true . He picked the pen , and he 's got the skillet head and everything . If he thinks we 'll treat him differently , he can kiss our three-cheeked ass . - Yeah , kiss it . - Kiss it . Get him down there . Pucker up . Boys , stop making the Corporate Messiah kiss your ass . Okay , whatever . He 's the Corporate Messiah . - Let 's go pick up dinner . - lt 's not quite that simple , dear . You see , they wanna groom Milo to become CEO . So they want him to live at corporate headquarters . What ? He 's just a little boy . Our little boy . I know , but Milo 's got a chance to actually make something of himself unlike the rest of this family , who are on a bullet train to Zeroville . Which , of course , is the last stop before Success Town . - Bob , I don 't want to give Milo away . - We 're not giving him away . We 're giving him a future . What about it , son ? You wanna make me the proudest father in the whole world ? - Sure , Dad . - Attaboy . You 're going to be a great man someday . Now , go pack your rubber sheet and let 's go . Milo , let me show you your new home . - Wait , can 't we hug him goodbye ? - Of course you can . That 's what the rubber arms are for . - We 'll miss you , bro . - l 'll miss you too . - Kick his ass . - Time to go . - We love you , Milo . - He can 't hear you . I think Milo 's suffocating . Oops , wig in the air duct . - What are you doing ? - Clearing my trophy case for Milo 's future awards . No big deal . All I had in there was my half-punched ticket from the Dairy Queen Sundae Club . If they hadn 't closed , you would 've had that free topping . Yeah , but enough of my triumphs . It 's Milo 's day in the sun . - Prepare to get soaked . - Yeah , super soaked . I must have done something to deserve this . I accept my punishment with quiet dignity . You 're doing it wrong . Milo always fights back . Hey , let 's go soak Grammy , at least she gurgles and moans . I miss Milo . You push a head that big out your birth canal , you 're changed for life . I miss the little diablo too , but we 're doing what 's best for him . You 're just making it harder on yourself . Let 's get on with the lesson . Stop fidgeting . - You 're a CEO . - l 'm a CEO with ADD . Your plant leaked mustard gas into the community and Mike Wallace is outside your door . Do you A , close the plant , B , launch an investigation ... - ... or C , blame it on the foreign guy ? - l wanna play with my friends . Not allowed . You 'll play with Reynolds from Accounting . - He 's under direct orders to be a hoot . - Hey there , young fella . - You wanna toss cards into a hat ? - l wanna play chariot race . Now I wanna play Ontor . You 're the evil Vartex . I must atomize your z-rays . My crusty old nipple ! That 's enough . Reynolds has another play date in Sector D. Visitor for the Corporate Messiah . - Mom ! - Hi , sweetie . - How 's everything going ? - Capital . Bullish. ln the black . - Milo , are you happy here ? - Sure . - l mean , Dad 's proud of me , right ? - He 's always been proud of you . Even when I locked him in that guitar case ? Hey , he got to go to Farm Aid , didn 't he ? Well , I 'm gonna make it up to him . As soon as I 'm CEO , I 'm giving Dad ... - ... that promotion he 's always wanted . - Time 's up . Milo 's due at the big stockholder meeting to kick off the worldwide launch of Manic . You 'll have a blast , Milo . There 'll be an omelet station . Bye , Mom . Bob , we have to talk . Pickles . Just in time . The inaugural batch of Manic is coming off the assembly line and all thanks to our son . Bob , this was a big mistake . He 's a boy . He should be out doing the things he loves , arguing with the mailbox , eating hair . You can 't get to the top without making some sacrifices . Don 't you get it , Bob ? He 's living your dream , not his . That 's a big , fat fib . - What 's going on ? - New company policy midday karaoke break . I 'm fixing to rap . That was my suggestion , but it got burned up . How did they know ? Good Lord , Pickles , you 're right . He is doing all this for me . How could I have been such a fiddly , faddily fool ? - Excuse the string of F-words . - So , what do we do ? Pickles , I want you to go home and move my pottery wheel out of Milo 's room . - l 'm bringing our boy home . - Yes ! My baby 's coming home . And no more lopsided salad bowls . I 've changed my mind . I want my son back . Too late . You signed him over to us , my burrito-shaped friend . Oh , Lord , what have I done ? - Your presence is not welcome here . - Activating ejection system . You haven 't heard the last of this ! Thank you . James , they won 't give Milo back . If only I could convince them he 's not a marketing whiz . Not now , Bob , we 've got trouble . Why is everyone acting so hinky ? I thought it was because Roland was singing Hall and Oates ... - ... but it 's the Manic . - The Manic ? The new stuff coming off the line doesn 't work like it 's supposed to . We 've all lost that happy feeling . But it 's the same sugar water Milo was making , only in different bottles . What could be different ? Aside from the bottles , of course . - Do you think it 's the bottles ? - Do I think what 's the bottles ? - What 's different . - That 's what we 're trying to figure out . Gadzooks ! Maybe it has something to do with the bottles . Kids , you 've got to tell me where Milo got the bottles for Manic . Sorry , that 's confidential information for members only . Fine , I 'll become a member . First , you must go through the traditional initiation . Careful , I walk with that . Morphine ? So you cleaned these bottles out and filled them with Manic ? Exactly , except for the cleaning out part . Do you realize what this means ? Milo 's not a marketing genius , He 's a drug pusher . And so , as we prepare to sell this overpriced belly wash ... - ... to the gullible of many lands- - - Stop ! Stop ! I 'm coming ! Listen to me . No one is going to buy Manic . People only liked it because the original batch was full of morphine . No problem , we 'll just add morphine . Never mind . Now , for your entertainment , the comedy stylings of Reynolds from Accounting . So- - Then the boy 's not a marketing genius ? Nope , I 'm just a plain old marginally disturbed kid . Great . Now what do we do with him ? I have a suggestion . You could tear up his contract and return him to his family . Capital idea. lf only we had a way to get more suggestions like that . - You could put up a suggestion box . - l like it . Let 's keep an eye on him . He 's a comer . - Did you catch his name ? - Yep , it was Phil Dorchester . No , it 's Bob Oblong . Oh , well , I 'm sure they heard me . Dad , I hope I do as well as you when I get into the business world . Thanks , son . Morphine . What a rascal . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

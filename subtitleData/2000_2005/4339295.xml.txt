 Futurama [ 5x08 ] - The Why Of Fry - CiWaN Delivery boy Philip J. Fry , reporting for duty . Dr. Zoidberg , soaking in brine . Ah What is the meaning of this ? We 've got a delivery . Let 's move ! Amy , mission profile . Interesting . Interesting . Dr. Zoidberg , mission bag ? Packed and ready , sir . What 's this ? This is the same toy surprise I got last time . I can 't work under these conditions . And without me , there is no mission . I am the mission . We 're back from the mission . What ? You went without me ? You were looking up curse words in the dictionary . It seemed like a better use of your time . But I 'm the delivery boy . Don 't worry , everything went fine . Better than usual . We got medals . Good work , team . We really pulled together on this one . Whoo-Hoo ! They got medals . I 'm real sorry I missed the mission . You might have needed me . Nope . But if I 'd been there , l- - Nope ! Look- - Nope . Bender 's great . Nope . Leela , let me make it up by taking you out for dinner tonight . Nope , I 've got a date with Chaz . Chaz ? I met him at that charity cockfight last week . He 's the mayor 's aide . Oh , you go , mutant girl . Oh . I do go . He 's a very important man . So ? I 'm just as important as him . It 's just that the kind of importance I have , it doesn 't matter if I don 't do it . Oh , I 'm nobody . There are guys in the background of " Mary Worth " comics ... Who are more important than me . Buck up , meat loaf . Bender will take you out and cheer you up . What do you want to do ? And I mean anything . You have the power . Name it and I 'm there . You the man . Well , okay . Let 's go bowling . Nah . Table for two ? Step right this way . I 'm afraid we don 't have a reservation , but as you can see ... I 'm the mayor 's aide . Table for two , please . Okay , then . Hey ! It 's okay , my man ... I got you covered on your next health inspection . Oh , I really appreciate that , Mr. Mayor 's Aide . Here you go . Compliments of the house . Wow ! Free bread at a restaurant ! Is there anything you can 't do ? I can 't fail the mayor . Not ever . Oh . Oh , jeez , I better not let Leela see me . Hey , I hear Fry . Boy , am I glad you 're here . You are ? Things aren 't working out with what 's-His-Name ? Actually , they are . Confidentially , I might not make it back to my apartment tonight . Could you walk Nibbler for me ? Ah ... And bring a baggie , in case he drops a steamer . Have a great night . Oh , no . Please , no ! Perfect . Whoa . Smells like a 289 in progress . Failure to scoop . Oh , yeah . Wait , I 'm trying . It weighs as much as 1,000 suns . Don 't worry . I 'll pull some strings , see if I can 't get you tried as a juvenile . Oh , Chaz . I 'm as worthless as this trashcan . You think I 'm as worthless as you ? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids , you dumb townie . Oh , Nibbler , at least I 'm important to you ... Even if it 's only because I clean up your poop . The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance . Did you just talk ? Indeed ... And I have other amazing powers as well . Like what ? Are you my mommy ? Negative . Welcome , Lord Nibbler . Welcome acknowledged . I bring with me The Mighty One . Uh ? At last , our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition . Aren 't you a fuzzy little guy ? Stop that ! Please , Your Mightiness . " Mightiness " ? Are you off your nut ? I got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs . Does he not know ? He does not know . He knows not ? Knows not does he . Not he knows ? Enough ! Fry , it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity ... The fate of our race , indeed , the fate of all that exists ... And ever will exist , rests with you . You are the single most important person in the universe . Oh , snap . On this auspicious occasion , let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast . The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun . You gonna eat that ? Maybe later . The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance . Fry , do you remember some months ago ... When Earth was attacked by Flying Brains ? I remember the dancing stomachs . That might 've been a Mylanta commercial . Wait , the Brains ! I do remember ... But no one else does . They said I was crazy . You remember because you were ... The only one immune to the Brains ' mental attack . Because I 'm so smart ? Oh , my . Anyway , your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brain wave . It 's a genetic abnormality , which resulted when you went back in time ... And performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather . I did do the nasty in the past-Y . Verily , and that past nastification is what shields you from the Brains . You are the last hope of the universe . So I really am important ? How I feel when I 'm drunk is correct ? Yes , except the Dave Matthews Band doesn 't rock . For a thousand years , the evil Brains have been constructing ... The info-Sphere , a giant memory bank ... Twice the size of three ordinary memory banks . What 's evil about that ? They plan to collect ... All the information in the universe and store it within the sphere . They 're trying to learn things ? Right . Those bastards ! Being brains , they feel compelled ... To know everything , and soon they will . I 'm as mad as I 've ever been . Once their task is complete ... They will ensure that no new information arises ... In the only way possible . By destroying the universe . Now it 's personal . Your mission is to infiltrate the info-Sphere ... And plant this quantum interface bomb ... Blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return . Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Junior . Okay , let 's go through this once more from the- - Brains ! Fear not , Mighty One . Your missing brain wave makes you invisible to them . So long as you avoid intense thinking . Sorry , what ? I wasn 't paying attention . That is most wise . Who ? In a few seconds , the Brains will finish scanning ... The last bits of information in the universe . Beavers mate for life . Eleven greater than four . For quality carpets , visit Caplan ' s Carpet Warehouse . Now the info-Sphere will open its protective crust ... So as to scan itself , completing its thousand-Year task . This is your one chance to enter the sphere . Scoot . Scoot now ! I 'm at the input console . I 'm nervous , and I 've got brain in my butt crack . Roger . Once you press the detonator , you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape . Hey , wait . This Brain knows about everything , right ? It will soon . That 's why you 're supposed to be setting off a bomb . I can 't pass up a chance to learn the answers ... To the greatest questions of all time . Is it true that postage-Stamp glue is made of- - ? Correct , toad mucus . There 's no time for this . Activate the bomb . Wait , wait , wait . What really killed the dinosaurs ? Me ! Unauthorized data access . Uh-Oh . Detecting trace amounts of mental activity . Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer . Ew ! Gross , cut it out . Odd , he is immune to our psionic attack . Impossible . We 're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove . It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one ... But without his Scooty-Puff Junior , he cannot escape . A quantum interface bomb ? Are you insane in the membrane ? You got it , Poindexter . Oh , not good . Detonation in T-Minus 60 Earth seconds . You fool ! You will be transported to the other universe with us . Trapped there for all eternity . We 'll form a tight clique that you won 't be part of . Well , at least I did one important thing with my life ... Leading good to victory over evil . Yeah ! Exactly ! The Nibblonians ? Good ? Ha . During your last moments in this universe , perhaps you should query ... Our database concerning the night of December 31 , 1999 . The day I got frozen ? What about it ? No . Don 't ask about that . It would be boring . Forget it , then . Query ! Okay . What happened to me , Philip J. Fry , on the night of December 31 , 1999 ? Clarification request . Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth ... Or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squid World 97A ? Earth , you fat idiot . Hurry up . Hello ? Pizza delivery for ... " I. C. Wiener " ? Oh , crud . Uh , I can 't believe how fat I look . Oh , Nibbler 's there . Wait . What ? ! What the- - ? I- - I don 't understand . You made me go in the freezer tube ? Detonation in T-Minus 15 seconds . You little runts froze me . You took away my life . We can explain . No , you can 't . Shut your adorable trap . We had no choice . You were the only one who could help us . What is one life weighed against the entire universe ? But it was my life . Detonation in two , one- - Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird- - ? Oh , never mind , zero ! Well , here we are , trapped for eternity . We could sing " American Pie . " Go ahead , I deserve it . I wish those stupid raccoons had never brought me to the future . I have shocking data relevant to this conversation . We don 't care , you dope . We 're in another universe . You 're not in charge . It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31 , 1999 . Really ? I can go back in time ? There is a nexus point ... At the space-Time where you entered the cryogenic tube . You , and only you , can return there . Interesting . You could stop the Nibblonian ... From pushing you into the cryogenic tube . That is interesting . Why ? It will be as if you never came to the future . You will have your life back , and we will succeed ... In our plan to understand and destroy the universe . Everybody wins . The human returns to the past ! Meanwhile ... . I love rocket skating , but the wait is always so long . Poor Fry once stood in line six hours just to get me a ticket . Six hours ? Sounds like a real nobody ... But now it 's time for somebody and some chick he 's with to go skating . You reserved the whole rink ? Yep , buzzed ahead ... Let them know whose aide was coming by . The mayor 's , that 's whose . Oh , Chaz ! Mr. Vogel , I thought we was going skating . No , we 're not important enough . Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver comes back from his haircut . Oh , let 's let those kids skate with us . What ? Seriously ? I 'm trying to impress you with my clout . I know , and it 's working . But think how much skating would mean to those kids . We came here instead of eating today . This might be their only chance to skate here their whole lives . Who are we to say they can 't ? The mayor 's aide and his badge . Beat it , kids ! Come back when you got connections . All right , little ones ... Back to the orphanarium . You can slide around the gym in your socks . What socks ? So am I gonna get lucky tonight , or what ? I hope your calculations are correct . Our calculations are always correct , for we are gigantic brains . Initiate space-Time transfer . I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza . One pie , nothing good on it . Name ? I-Period-C-Period Wiener . Talk a little louder . It sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you . Hello ? Pizza delivery for ... " I.C. Wiener " ? Oh , crud . Gotcha ! I don 't understand . Yes , you do . You came back in time to knock me into that freezer ... And now I came back to stop you . I did not come back in time . My people lack that ability . But I know you in the future . I cleaned your poop . Quite possible . We live long and are celebrated poopers . You will meet me when I 'm 1,000 years older . Not if you don 't freeze me . Please , our sages foresee that in 1,000 years ... For one moment , the fate of the universe will depend on you . Since you will not live that long , I must freeze you now . Well , why couldn 't you just ask me ? We were afraid you would refuse . Of course not , I love the future . Then why are you choking me right now ? Because I don 't like being used . Well , now it 's your choice . Is there nothing in the future worth saving ? Hmm . Leela , but she doesn 't think much of me . Oh , she must be The Other . What ? You must not give up on her . I am stationed on a distant world known as Virgon Six ... But if you return to the future , I will transfer to Earth ... To give you what help I can . Ten , nine , eight , seven ... You think I had a chance with Leela ? You must choose . The present or the future ? To save yourself or save Leela . One ! Yes ! Here I come , future . Oh , no , wait ! I 'm gonna get trapped in the info-Sphere again . Just remember that Scooty-Puff Junior sucks ! In 1,000 years , I 'll get right on it . And so 1,000 years later , Fry once again ... Infiltrated the info-Sphere and set off his amazing bomb . Only this time ... . Thank you for saving the universe , Fry . Here . Oh , thanks . If you ever need a savior again , just ask . Oh , we will . We will . I can 't wait to tell everyone what happened . Yes . Incidentally , I need to remain undercover ... So I 'm blanking your memory . Did everything just taste purple for a second ? Oh , well , let 's go home , you dumb poop machine . Bender , would you do the honors ? With gusto . Hey , Leela . I guess I got this for you . Oh , thank you . You know what ? I don 't care if you 're not ... The most important person in the universe . It really makes me happy to see you right now . Then I am the most important person in the universe . Yes !

 I always said there 's three kinds of people in the world ... them who make things happen , them who watch things happen ... and them who wonder what happened . I made things happen . The wrong things . I caused pain to anyone who came near me . This tattoo , it used to be my badge of honor . But I 'm a different man since I 've joined group . A better man . I never thought words like that would come out of my mouth . It 's all because of the help ... and the love that I found in this room . You 're new here . Is it Ed ? Yeah , I 'm new to this B.S. Why do you think it 's B.S. ? I mean , listen , man . I turned my life around . A lot of us here have . Our kind of lives go one way . And you can 't change any more than you can undo the crimes you 've done . Well , I feel sorry for you , man . Don 't feel sorry . You 're going to hell just like I am , brother . Why are you here , Ed ? I drove Victor . He knows I 'm right . Victor 's been doing good . Oh , yeah . Just look at him . Victor , you wanna talk about it ? I 've just been having bad dreams . Really bad dreams . What kind of dreams ? Oh ... seeing people skinned alive . It 's a hard road , Victor . It 's a shock to the system ... changing the way we think , taking charge of our lives . We 're all afraid . And that fear preys on us night and day , brother . In our minds and in our dreams . You ever get enough of that crap ? " A shock to the system " crap ? This " fear preying on us night and day " crap ? Those boys in there are afraid of one thing ... themselves , their true natures . You know what I 'm saying , Victor ? - Sort of . - What do you mean , " sort of " ? Don 't tell me that bull does you any good . And don 't tell me you feel any better about yourself coming here ... that it makes these nightmares go away . No , it don 't . Hey . Thanks for coming . Sorry about the hour . The way you sounded seemed like something that couldn 't wait . No . I need another set of eyes on it . I called Scully in too . A little late to be looking for a sitter . What 's so pressing ? " Victor Dale Potts . " Ex-con , three-time loser , career criminal . He was murdered five days ago . Scully 's got the crime report . I 'm sorry . What am I missing ? It 's the way he was killed . Agent Doggett . Agent Scully . I 'd like him to see the body . Damn . I seen a bunch of these when I was a cop . It 's a favorite of some of the Pan-Asian gangs . The difference is Victor Potts had a premonition of his death . And ? That was my question . What I 'm saying is , this man was skinned alive ... just hours after describing it in exact detail . Maybe he could describe it because maybe somebody threatened him . He said it came in a dream , or a vision according to the woman who last spoke to him . - Who 's that ? - Dr. Lisa Holland . She 's a therapist who runs an anger management group for ex-cons . Lifelong criminal 's bound to have some bad enemies . People capable of this very thing . I mean , unless there 's something here that I 'm just not seeing . Well , from what I could see from my visual exam ... the skin was removed with considerable skill ... by someone using a hunting-type knife . Arteries and veins were left intact ... so as to prolong the period that the victim would suffer . Terrible way to die , for sure . I know . Is there anything else , Agent Reyes ? Something special that brought this case to your attention ... as a possible X-File ? No . I just know I need to solve this . And I 'd appreciate your help . You Reyes ? I 'm Doggett . She 's Reyes . Detective Van Allen ? That 's right . I appreciate your help on this . What help is that ? - On this investigation . - There isn 't a lot to investigate . I mean , Victor Potts wasn 't exactly one of the FBI 's ten most wanted . I think she means your insight into the way he died , Detective . Don 't have any . But I 'm sure you 'd rather talk to somebody who actually gives a damn , right ? Hate to say it but he probably sums up most people 's feelings . It 's hard for the Victor Pottses of the world . Nobody cares much about them in life or in death . Victor told the group a story ... about a dream he 'd had . These men are haunted by their pasts . That 's why they 're here . But this dream came true . Sometimes the past they want to escape won 't let them . There was a man ... Ed . He drove Victor to group that night . He was all over Victor 's case . You think he could have killed him ? I try to help these men . Some have been violent , some still are . It 's not my place to judge them . Dr. Holland ... there 's justice to be served here . You can 't forget that . I 'm sure Agent Reyes won 't let me . Probably won 't let anybody . Thank you for your help . She contacted you with this case ? I think the police would have given up on who murdered Victor Potts ... if it wasn 't for her . You know something , Agent Reyes ? You seem real familiar to me . Excuse me ? You ever visited Novi before ? No , I never have . You eyeballing me ? You got some kind of problem or something ? Problem ? Your friend is dead . I guess the good news is I get to move up the ladder here now . You know how it happened . Now , why don 't you just back off . FBI wants to talk to me now because of the way he died . Gonna want to talk to you too . I got nothing to tell nobody . You were messing with his head . I 'd watch what you go saying . Or what ? You going to do me too ? I got a ride to catch . Yeah , that 's right , walk away . But just like you said ... you can 't run from what you are . Yeah , and I 'll see you in hell . Here you go , Dr. Scully . Everything you ever wanted to know about skinning people ... but were afraid to ask . This is every case of removal of the human dermis ... I could find within the last dozen years . Most of these are postmortem skinnings . That 's all I could find . And most of it 's Asian gang-related , like you mentioned . Wait a minute . What 's this ? I 'm sorry . I probably shouldn 't have included that one ... because it 's pretty much ancient history . There 's a pattern . There 's a pattern . The way the skin 's been stripped off . It 's identical . But how could it be ? Did you notice the date ? 1960 . ... Inca and Mayan peoples . However , the priest thought that souls survived on Earth ... as a living shrub , tree or other foliage , and ... - Excuse me . Dr. Mueller ? Dr. Bertram Mueller ? Yes ? My name is Dana Scully . I 'm with the FBI . I want to ask you some questions about a John Doe ... you did an autopsy on in 1960 . You honestly expect me to recall ... some case from way back when ? I 'm 84 years old . Sir , this particular victim was skinned alive . In all my days , I never saw anything as inhuman as this . Sir , I haven 't located police records from the investigation . Was there ever a suspect who was charged or arrested ... in this case as far as you know ? No suspects , no investigation for that matter . I don 't understand . The victim was a John Doe ... a nobody . Carl Hobart , the county sheriff , figured he was a drifter . Hobart said he didn 't want to stir up the community . And no one called him on that ? I tried . The sheriff had other things on his mind , I suppose . Why do you say that ? Well , it wasn 't long after that he put a bullet through his head . What are you thinking , Doctor ? This is some copycat murder 40-odd years later ? If so , it 's the most perfectly executed that I 've ever seen . And why copy an obscure murder ... that nobody 's ever even heard of ? A string of murders . - I 'm sorry ? - I thought you knew . John Doe ... was only the first . Hey , I 'm working in here . Is that you , Ed ? Come see what I got for you . Tell you what . You best clear the hell out , whoever you are ! Hey ! Oh , God ! Oh , God , no ! Let me go ! Let me down ! Dr. Holland ? Lisa ? Dr. Holland ? Monica ? What the hell are you dreaming about ? Nothing . It was a nightmare . How did you know to come in here ? I was on the phone . I could hear you through the wall calling out . Who were you on the phone to ? Dr. Lisa Holland . That anger-management group she runs , it 's getting smaller . It 's okay . Let ' em through . Go ahead . - What happened to the lights ? - Somebody cut ' em . Might want to watch your step . We got some blood on the floor . Not as much as you 'd expect . Oh , my God ! Hey , you okay ? Monica ? Agent Reyes , I got a call from Agent Doggett . He said there 's another victim . Monica , you okay ? I 'm just catching my breath . Well , if you 're up for it , I 've got something to show you . Case files from crimes back in 1960 . What are they ? More skinned bodies ... cut with the same precision as the body I examined . Can I see that light a second ? Holy God , he 's still alive . Somebody get in here and get him down ! We need a medic in here ! Can you hear me ? Do you understand ? Who did this to you ? Do you know who did this to you ? Are we going somewhere , baby ? You 're not . Get out . Eddie ? What 'd I just say ? But I 'm not even dressed . What else is new ? Get out . Why are you such a jerk ? FBI ! Stop right there ! What part of " Stop right there " did you not understand ? So , what ? He 's just waiting for his lawyer ? That 's what he 's doing ? He 's in a bad place . I 've been there myself once or twice sitting right where he is now ... not thinking you have a chance . Yeah ? You ever murdered two men ? He 's four years out of prison ... holding down a job , showing up to work sober . Why do it ? Kill a friend , then a coworker ? You 're the one that said he was a hothead , right ? Why run if you 're not guilty ? Bag packed to hit the road ... packed with knives ? I don 't think we 're gonna find the murder weapon on him . What makes you say that ? Because I think this man here is running from something else . I want to talk to him . Hi . My name is Monica . I know what you 're thinking , that I must be the good cop . No such thing . You didn 't do it , did you ? Your friend , Victor ... he said he had bad dreams ... seeing things . I think you 're seeing them now . How would you know ? Maybe I see them too . Can I talk to you for a second ? You wanna explain to me what you 're doing in there , Agent Reyes ? I 'm trying to make a connection . Hell of a way to do it . I can see this guy 's defense already . " Your Honor , I was having bad dreams , seeing things . Ask Agent Reyes , she 's seeing ' em too . " Something you 're not telling me ? You two about finished ? With what ? The suspect . - He 's not our man . - What are you talking about ? Girlfriend vouched for him . Said they were getting hammered down at the Bent Oak from 6 : 00 till closing . Bartender confirms it . I don 't believe this . I know where you live , partner . You 're always welcome at group . Agent Reyes . I need you to come to Quantico right away . Why ? I have something to show you . Agent Scully ? Agent Reyes . What are these ? I showed you files of men killed in 1960 ... skinned alive like the current victims . I had two of those bodies exhumed looking for crossover forensic details . - Are there any ? - Yes . There are cuts in the bone ... on the tibias and on the shoulder girdles ... that matched the cutting pattern I found on Victor Potts ... using the exact same knife ... which left a signature pattern of grooves . Same knife , same killer . That 's what you 're saying , right ? Well , it 's even weirder than that . I ran bios and backgrounds from the victims from 1960 . They 're both ex-convicts like the current victims ? Mm-hmm . But look at the date that they died . March 8 , 1960 . June 21 , 1960 . Birth dates ... of Victor Potts and Terry Pruit . Potts and Pruit were born on the exact same dates ... that the previous victims died . You knew that we 'd find something like this , didn 't you , Agent Reyes ? How ? John Doggett . Where are you ? Sitting outside the suspect 's house ... wondering where the surveillance is I ordered . I need a birth date on him . - Who ? - The suspect , Ed Kelso . It 's important . He may be in danger . He may be gone . I 'll call you . Yeah , this is John Doggett . I need to speak to Detective Van Allen . I 'll hang on . Just get him . This house was supposed to be under a 24-hour watch . Patrolman says he wasn 't gone more than five minutes . You see that man in there ? You think it takes five minutes to do that to somebody , Detective ? I don 't know how long it takes , Agent Doggett . Only know you said watch him so he don 't run . Agent Doggett . I have something to tell you . This thing with the birthdays is weird , no doubt about it . Looks to me like we 're dealing with a real sick puppy here . I don 't think so . Choosing your victims because of their damn birth dates ... it 's the very definition of a serial killer . I think we should get the boys from Behavioral Science out on this . No . That 's not what 's happening here . It 's the only thing that makes sense . To you . Okay , what do you think it is ? He knew he was going to die . He had a premonition of his death . Just like the first victim did . So how do you figure that ? I 'm involved in this some way . I have some kind of memory of it . It 's all happened before and now it 's happening again . You mean that it 's a copycat and you have some kind of recall . These men ... were born to die this way . The same way they died before . The same way they died before ? Not the men , but their souls . Their souls are murdered over and over again ... from one lifetime to the next ... by someone who won 't let them rest . Now , how 's this happening , their souls coming back ? Reincarnation ? It doesn 't strike you ... that these men were all born on the dates of the previous victims ' deaths ? Yeah , it strikes me . It strikes me that the killer is clever . A rag is stuffed in his mouth . A dirty rag . Black with soot . Coal dust ... from a coal mine . How the hell did you know that ? I don 't know . So what are we looking for ? I don 't know exactly . But if the old files are correct ... there 's going to be a fourth victim . It looks like housekeeping hasn 't been here in awhile . You or me ? I 'll check out the mine . You shouldn 't have come here . I 'm a federal agent . I 'm armed . Let go of the gun now . You can 't stop it . You never do . You always fail . It 's your lot . Agent Reyes . Monica ! Agent Reyes . Are you hurt ? Talk to me . - He was here . - Who ? Van Allen . He 's who 's killing these men . Van Allen ? He was skinned himself ... back in 1868 ... by four men in a mining dispute . His killers were never punished . Now he 's born to keep avenging that injustice again and again . Van Allen 's the cop here . That 's why these cases never get solved . Every time , four murders . Every time , four bodies . Then he takes his own life so he can just start it up all over again . There 's still a fourth victim , and I think I know who it is . Lisa Holland . Dr. Holland , it 's Monica Reyes . You 've seen the visions , haven 't you ? Just like the others in your group . Visions of people skinned alive . It 's true , isn 't it ? How did you know ? Where are you now ? I 'm just finishing a session . Is there anybody with you ? No , they 've all left . Why ? What 's this about ? Get out of there . You 're in danger . It 's Detective Van Allen . He 's coming after you . Dr. Holland ? Dr. Holland . Time 's come ! You 're the last . No use running . It always ends the same . Get the paramedics out here . You ... Always fail . You 're not dying on me . Not until you tell me what you mean ! Doc says it 's gonna be touch-and-go tonight . That we should go home . Go on , Monica . Go on home . There 's nothing you 're gonna learn here now . You still won 't believe it , will you ? My connection to this man . However you did it , however you knew what you know ... what matters here is you saved a woman 's life . He 's trying . We all are . It 's just a long way to go from ... this ... to this . Do you believe in second chances , Dana ? A chance to correct the mistakes we make in our lives ? You mean in a future life ? That 's what these people were trying to do . All the victims , trying to atone for their sins ... from what happened in that photo . Only this man wouldn 't let them . And Lisa Holland ? What about her ? She was one of them . One of the men you see standing there . And you ? Whoever I was , I failed . In 1868 . In 1909 . In 1960 , I failed . I was always there , but I couldn 't stop the killings ... and he knew that . Just like he knows I 'm here right now . He feels me ... the way I felt him ... when I saw that picture of the first victim . And somehow he knows my deepest fear ... that I 'll fail . Well , maybe in this life you succeed . Maybe .

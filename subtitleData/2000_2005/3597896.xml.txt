 Once up a time , there were three - how shall I put this ? - geeks . Three more unlikely heroes there never were . We defend the defenseless . I don 't see any other way . It wasn 't long before their naiveté nearly got them killed , so they hooked up with an fbi agent ... That 's why we like you . Your ideas are weirder than ours . and began publishing a - what shall I call it ? - rag called The Lone Gunman . The guys at the NSA and the ClA tremble every time we put out one of these babies . From their cramped basement office , they pointed fingers at powerful evil forces . And some not so evil . In their own unique way , the three Gunmen were patriots , fighting the good fight . - We tell the stories others refuse to tell . - That 's one way to put it . And provided expertise for their friends at the fbi . She 's hot . For a brief time , it looked as if they might make a difference in this cold , cruel world . They acquired an intern who believed in them . Let 's fight for lost causes. I wanna help . And a powerful , beautiful nemesis , who became an ally . But the world is not kind to idealists , and those who fight the good fight don 't always win . Morris . Morris , it 's going " ping . " It most certainly is . Ping . You 're gonna make me spill . - Morris , what is all that stuff anyway ? - Don 't make me talk shop. lt is so boring . But I wanna know . All right . Where do I begin ? We 're in the Bermuda Triangle . That place where all those planes and ships have mysteriously disappeared . - Who named it the Bermuda Triangle ? - Wait . You ? Yeah . That was in my former life , before I joined the private sector . There are things I can 't talk about owing to national security , but I will say this : there are powerful forces out here . Primal , otherworldly forces , hidden beneath the waves , just waiting to be plucked by man . Somebody 's coming . Whatever you 're selling , we don 't want any . No ganja . Whoa . Wait . You want the girl ? I can dig it. I 'm down with that . Wait , guys . This is a rental . There 's a $ 15,000 deposit on this . Your employer wanted me to tell you , you 're fired . - Morris Fletcher ? - Finally . What took you so long ? You must be Reyes . Yeah . Mr Fletcher , we 've been told you requested us by name . We 're very curious about that . You two head the fbi 's X-Files unit , do you not ? I thought you 'd appreciate what I have to offer . Which is ? You have no idea who you 're sitting here with , do you ? A guy who 's up fudge creek for violating the Federal Secrets Act . I 've got top security clearance. I 'm meant to check in every month with my ex-employer . So I skipped a few phone calls . Big deal . Let me give you a hint . I used to work at Groom Lake , Nevada . Area 51 ? I was a man in black . The men in black . What ? You 've never heard of us ? - l saw the movie . - Yeah , well . There are a lot of technical inaccuracies in that thing . Anyway , I 'm ready to make a deal . - What deal would that be ? - The one that saves my furry pink ass . People are trying to kill me . Did you hear about my boat ? Your female companion told us what she witnessed . My fem ... ? You mean they didn 't kill ... - Brittany ? - Brittany . Thank God she 's still alive . I need protection . I need to get outta here . You scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . I can give you guys the keys to the kingdom - UFOs , aliens , the whole 50-year cover-up . - l was there for all of it . - Tell me , Mr Fletcher , these documents of yours , are they indicative of the kind of secrets you can reveal to us ? Honey , they 're just the tip of the iceberg . This is the Jupiter 2 from Lost in Space . Yeah , those are BS . But only those . I was freelancing for this foreign billionaire . I told him the air force lost a flying saucer in the Bermuda Triangle , and that I could recover it for him . I just wanted to cruise the Bahamas . I never would have given him the real thing . That would be un-American . - Coming out . - He found out . He wants to kill me . I need protection . Super-soldiers . What do you know about super-soldiers ? A bit . It may be there 's one I can help you lay your hands on . This super-soldier , he have a name ? Not he . She . What the hell do they want ? Gentlemen . What happened here ? Did you get robbed ? - No . - We 're upgrading everything . We gave away all our old crap to the Salvation Army . We 're buying totally new stuff . - What can we do for you ? - We were hoping you could help us out . For months now we 've been investigating this secret cadre , the so-called super-soldiers . - Genetically altered humans . - That want to kill Mulder . Exactly . We 'd like your help tracking one down . This woman . You recognize her ? She 's a fellow hacker . Damn fine one . She calls herself Yves Adele Harlow . It 's not her real name . She disappeared a year ago and nobody 's seen her since . We have reason to believe that she 's resurfaced , and that she 's become one of these super-soldiers . What in hell are you talking about ? She 's no super-soldier . - Absolutely not . - Who told you that ? This is pointless . These three monkeys couldn 't find stink in an outhouse . You son of a ... - Let me at him . - l 'll hold him down . - Fellas . - You got a nerve coming here . Miserable son of a bitch . - Told you they wouldn 't help . - All right . Everybody just shut up . This man is a professional liar . Every word out of his mouth . - He used us to track Yves down a year ago . - And then he abducted her . Which is why I know what happened to her . I facilitated a meeting is all . And the man I was working for , I didn 't know in advance what he was planning to do to her . - Not my finest hour , I 'll admit it . - Every word out of his mouth . Agents , I 'm telling you , you don 't want these three involved . They don 't even have their gismos . This place is like " How the Grinch Stole RadioShack . " All right . You three know this woman . I want your help . We need to track down this Yves Adele Harlow . Knock , please . My office hours are 3 to 5 , Mondays and Fridays . You 'll make time for me , Professor . Douglas , are you ready to go ? Douglas ? Airline reservation database . What name do we look under ? Try her old standby - different anagrams of Lee Harvey Oswald . " Area 51 Exposé ? " - Where 's your new issue ? This is a year old . - Back off , skeezicks . You 'll never find her that way . He 's right . No anagrams for Yves Adele Harlow . - So who 's Joey ? - What ? Joey Ramone . Leader of the greatest punk rock band in human history . Now shut up . What ? What are you ? 34 ? 35 ? Why don 't you cut your hair and grow up ? Need I remind you that Doggett and Reyes aren 't here to save you . Yeah , well . Get yourself a real hero , anyway . Not some dead teenybopper . You wanna know why Joey Ramone 's my hero ? 'Cause people like you never managed to grind him down . They never stole his spirit . He never gave in , never gave up , and never sold out . Right till his last breath . And he 's not dead . Guys like that , they live forever . Langly , just ignore him . If we have to work together , let 's work together . We don 't have to work together . Watching you three trying to find your butts with both hands is not my idea of a fun time . Wouldn 't it be easier tracking Yves if you knew her real name ? You know her real name ? Lois Runtz . Lois Runtz ? Uh-huh . - l 'm telling you the truth . - lf you were , it 'd be a first . Nobody knows about that door . That 's our secret door . Does Lois know about it ? Yves ? Jimmy ? Guys . Jimmy ? - How you feeling ? - Oh , right . The old errand boy . Guy used to intern for you losers , right ? I wondered what happened to you . Why is he here ? fbi business. lt 's a long story . Where the hell you been , big guy ? Zurich , then Malta , then Yemen . And just now New Jersey . It 's been a real geology lesson . I ran out of money , so I hitchhiked here . I snuck in the back ' cause I didn 't know if the place was being watched . I just had to see you guys . It 's about Lois . Lois Runtz ? - That 's Yves ' real name . - l told you so . Wait a minute . You tracked her all over the world ? You ? Mr Brainpower here is lucky to be alive . Why did you send him ? Were you trying to get him killed ? He sent himself . We tried to talk him out of it . Yeah . Now I almost wish you had . Jimmy , what is it ? Are you all right ? Last night , I traced her to a little college in New Jersey . It 's the closest I 've been in a year of searching . I saw her. I actually laid my eyes on her . I called to her , but she ran . Later on , I found out ... Guys , I think she murdered somebody . One down . John Gillnitz ? I 'm Agent Reyes , and this is Agent Doggett . is this the woman you saw last night ? It was dark. lt could have been her . Do you have her in custody ? We 're working on it . What can you tell us about your friend ? Any reason why he may have been targeted ? Absolutely none . Douglas was a wonderful teacher , and an even better researcher . - What did he research ? - Elasmobranchii . Sharks , rays and skates . - He was a marine biologist ? - An immunologist . Sharks have a remarkable immune system . Toxins that would kill any other vertebrate pass right through them . So he did medical research ? Douglas wanted to save the world . Cheer up , gomer . You 're bringing the whole room down . This is a computer , Langly . Com-pu-ter . Step away before you embarrass yourself . - Always a pleasure , Kimmy . - Yeah , yeah . So , then , how do you wish to partake of my hacking genius ? - Thanks to Jimmy , we know Yves ' real name . - l told you before he did . Jimmy also told us what kind of car she 's driving . A silver X5 with New York plates . Really ? Way to go , special ed . The New Jersey Turnpike has cameras at every tollbooth . - Langly spotted her southbound at Newark . - Somewhat creative . We spotted her again going through the Fort McHenry Tunnel not 20 minutes ago . We 're betting she 's headed for DC . We 'll try to intercept her , with your help . Think you might find a military satellite to give us a bird 's-eye view of the Beltway ? lntriguing . Stand aside , ladies . - We 'll be on the cell . - l got shotgun . Dream on . You 're staying here . We need somebody we can trust keeping an eye on Fletcher . I 'm on it . So how 'd you like Malta ? The only thing I can say for sure is what killed him . He was injected with some sort of tiny poison pellet . But the wound in his chest was postmortem . - What is that ? - That 's what I said . My best guess is bioluminescence , but I 'm still waiting to hear back from our lab . Bioluminescence ? The stuff that makes lightning bugs glow ? Lightning bugs , plankton , jellyfish . But generally not dead college professors . - So this stuff was put on postmortem ? - No . As near as I can tell , it bled out of him . It gets weirder still . When I opened him up , I found adhesions that indicate past surgery . So I 'm figuring I 'll find he had a bypass or a pacemaker . Instead , I find ... this . - lt looks like cartilage . - lt is . It was living tissue grafted into him . I have absolutely no idea why . It held something . Something that 's now missing . Could that be the purpose of this wound ? A little ad hoc surgery ? Maybe that was the very purpose of the murder . Whatever was inside him , she removed it . What the hell was inside him ? I have no clue . Seriously , this is the first I 'm hearing of it . Weird organs ? You 've never heard of the man ? Professor Douglas Houghton . You 're looking at me oddly . Perhaps because you 've been known to lie on occasion . I 'm not lying now. I 've said from the start I didn 't know what she was up to . Damn it . Crashed again . I cannot make magic with substandard equipment . - What 's the problem ? - The problem is , it 's a freaking piece ofjunk . I knew those guys were broke , but this is pathetic . The guys are broke ? Are you kidding ? Look around this dump . They had to hock all their stuff just to pay the rent . - What about this ? - Their paper ? Deader than disco . They haven 't published in months . So saving the world doesn 't pay the bills . There 's a hot news flash for you . What chumps . They were getting by till you put ' em out of business . And how exactly did I do that ? When you took Yves . They spent every last dime trying to find her . They 're loyal to their friends . Hilarious , huh ? - Reyes . - You better get here quick . - Where are you ? - The Hotel Farragut . Hurry . - She 'll kill him . - Doggett and Reyes are coming . By then it 'll be too late . Yves . Don 't do it . Lois ? Should I call you that ? I prefer Yves . So we take it you 're not a super-soldier ? Super what ? Long story . Never mind . Yves , you weren 't seriously going to smoke that guy , were you ? I know you three mean well , but I can 't begin to tell you how badly you 've mucked things up . - So this guy just up and bolted ? - He hit her , and then he took off . Nobody 's seen him . The room is registered to Leonard Southhall of Darien , Connecticut . - lt 's an alias . - lt 's a stolen id . The real Leonard Southhall died in 1996 . You wanna tell me who that was ? His real name ? I have no idea . This is your bag , isn 't it ? It 's quite a party you got planned for him . Respirator . Surgical gloves . Scalpel . Not to mention this little item here . You were planning to cut him open , like you did the professor . Why ? Yves , it can 't be true . Tell them it 's not . It is , Jimmy . Time is running short . Unless you let me finish what I started , innocent people will die . - You wanna elaborate on that ? - First things first . Who was it that put you on to me ? OK , guys . So she 's not a super-soldier . I made an honest mistake . As I suspected . It 's a tracking device . I 'm sure he meant to activate it once he knew you had me . You 've been wearing that since Miami . You were running a scam on us from the start . Blowing up the boat , the girl as your witness - you planned all that . That and all the super-soldier bull . All that was just to hook us . So that you two would , in turn , hook us . And we 'd track down Yves for this slime ball all over again . What can I tell ya ? You three always get the job done for me . Who do you work for , Fletcher ? An international arms dealer , a billionaire , and scum of the earth . And he 's also ... My father . My father is a murderer and a supporter of terrorism. I hate everything he stands for . Yves , you 're a murderer too . The man I killed was a terrorist , Jimmy . A zealot whose research was funded by my father for its potential as a weapons system . Houghton was an immunologist , researching sharks . Yes . And he used his knowledge of their immune system to devise a vessel of sorts that kept him safe from an engineered virus he carried within him . He had tissue implanted in his chest . Cartilage . Shark cartilage . It contained something which you removed . - This virus you were talking about . - l destroyed it , but it was only one of two . The bald dude at the hotel , the one that got away . Think of him as a human time bomb . He can pass by any sniff dog , any metal detector , and no one would ever suspect . - What triggers this time bomb ? - Programmed cellular death , genetically altered to a high degree of precision . The way the vessel is decaying inside him is clock-like . It will lose integrity and rupture at eight o 'clock tonight . - Five hours from now ? - This virus , once it 's airborne its kill radius is five or six miles . Potentially it could kill thousands . Tens of thousands . Fletcher , I know you 're a dirt bag , but still , how could you be a party to this ? Fletcher 's a con man , not a killer . He didn 't know about it . Providing all this is true , how do we track this man down ? - Kimmy , zoom in more . Zoom in . - Back off , kibitzer. I 'm doing it . This is slower than Stumpy , my one-legged granny . - Where did you get this dinosaur turd ? - Stop bellyaching and work . - Those things 'll kill you . - Yeah . That 's why I quit 20 years ago . You want one ? So you 're too broke to publish ? Pencil neck told me . It 's a shame . This little rag always was such a hoot . I 'm gonna miss it . But , hey , the world spins on , right ? Maybe saving it is a younger man 's game . Or a woman 's . Maybe it is . You gotta admit , Byers , it hasn 't exactly been our year . And to top it all off , we screwed the pooch pretty good today . - Maybe we should pack it in . - And do what instead ? We never gave up . We never will . In the end , if that 's the best they can say about us , it 'll do . - l got him . - lt 's my hack , Langly. I got him . We got him , all right ? Our bad guy just rented a blue Corolla under his alias Leonard Southhall . - We picked him up on the satellite . - Hauling north like a bat out of hell . New Jersey Turnpike , 30 miles south of Newark . I think I know where he 's headed . - Long Gunman Newspaper Group , Byers . - Byers , John Doggett . Agent Doggett . Do you have him ? Yeah . We got him . How much do you trust this Yves Harlow , Lois Runtz , whatever name she 's telling you ? Completely . Why ? Because the doctors here have run every kind of imaging and come up snake eyes . No virus , no cartilage vessel in his chest , nothing . - They found nothing . - That doesn 't make sense . - They 're absolutely certain ? - 100 percent . Agent Reyes and I are looking like a couple of fools on this one . There must be something we missed . All I can tell you is , we got the wrong guy . There must be a second man . I know there is. lt 's Basic Terrorism 101 . Except we don 't know his name or his target . And we 've got one hour to find him . Good evening . You 're good . All my information pointed to that man . He goes by an alias . He traveled to Washington on this very day . - Clearly he 's involved somehow . - He must be . He made a beeline to that biology department where the professor worked . - Their base of operation . - Yeah . So if he is involved and yet he doesn 't have the virus ... ? - So how exactly does he fit into their plan ? - Three card monty . - You ever played it ? You have now . - What 's that supposed to mean ? It means these guys have you running after the ace when you should chase the queen . Oh , my God . Southhall is the decoy . That 's all he is . They knew you were on their trail so they gave you someone else to follow . - You said you didn 't know about terrorists . - l don 't . But I know scams. I wasn 't a man in black all those years for nothing . They made you work at finding Southhall , which tells me the real guy is hiding right out in the open . A friend of the dead professor . A coworker , maybe . The man who saw me through the professor 's window . The one who identified me . Ladies and gentlemen , scientists , academic leaders and government representatives . Coming together is our goal this evening , coming together as one . Those words are easily spoken , but guiding our missile into that fugitive and imponderable target is harder . - Sorry . Conference attendees only . - We 're reporters . - What newspaper do you work for ? - The Lone Gunman . - Never heard of it . - We 're legit . - Show him your press pass . - lt 's important we get in there . - Buddy , come on . - These expired last December . - We 've got five minutes . - Listen . We believe there 's a dangerous man in that room . I need all of you to step away right now . Look , thousands of people may die . I got a situation by the main conference room . John Gillnitz . John Gillnitz . Step back , sir . I 'm really sorry . - Where 'd he go ? - Split up . Four minutes left . Good luck . Wait . What do we do with this guy once we find him ? - Hold him till I get there. I 'll do the rest . - You mean cut him open ? If that virus gets into the airstream , we 'll have failed . People will die . Whatever it takes . Three minutes and counting . - Don 't try to run . - l don 't have to . - Yves . Jimmy . We 've found him . - Over here . What do you plan to do ? By my watch , it 's two minutes to eight . - Not much time for surgery . - Yves . Jimmy . Now you have a minute 40 . Guys ? Whatever it takes . Byers . Frohike . Langly . Yves . Come here . Guys . Guys . Oh , God . No . Don 't . Jimmy . Jimmy , don 't . It 's airtight . They 're already exposed . No , guys . Buddy , fight the good fight . Both of you . Never give up . Arlington . You must have pulled some big strings to get those guys in here . It 's the least I could do . Are we ready ? Yeah . Dana ? I 'll catch up . They meant so much to me . I 'm not sure if they ever really knew . Nobody knew what heroes they were . It 's not right . It 's not . No , it 's not . Langly said to me " the ones who never give up , they never die . " I still don 't know what that means . It means , like everyone buried here , the world is a better place for them having been in it . It means that they 're gone , but they live on through us all .

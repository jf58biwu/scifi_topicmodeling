 - A real beauty , ain 't she ? - Yes , sir . Tell you what . You buy this ship , treat her proper she 'll be with you for the rest of your life . Well ? You paid money for this , sir ? On purpose ? What ? Come on , seriously , Zoe , what do you think ? Honestly , sir , I think you got robbed . Robbed ? What do you mean ? It 's a piece of fei-oo . Fei-oo ? Okay , she won 't be winning any beauty contests anytime soon , but she is solid . A ship like this , be with you till the day you die . - Because it 's a death trap . - That 's not ... You are very much lacking in imagination . I imagine that 's so , sir . You haven 't seen most of it . Let me show you the rest . And try to see past what she is and on to what she can be . - What 's that , sir ? - Freedom , is what . I meant what 's that ? Step around that . Something was living in here . I tell you , we get a mechanic , get her up and running again hire a good pilot , maybe a cook , live like real people . A small crew . They must feel the need to be free . Take jobs as they come . They never have to be under the heel of nobody ever again . No matter how long the arm of The Alliance might get we 'll just get ourselves a little further . - Get her running again ? - Yeah . - So not running now ? - Not so much . But she will . I already know what I 'm gonna call her . Got a name all picked out . No . That is not true . - No . - I swear it is . Surely one of you must 've told him . No . Not one of the brethren had the heart to say anything . He was so proud . What ? What was he proud of ? Who he ? Looked rather natty , truth be told , you know ? What was natty ? I wanna hear about the natty thing . Shepherd Book was just telling us funny stories about his life at the monastery . Monastic humor . I miss out on all the fun . And all the food too , apparently . Just who do you think you 're married to ? - Voil√† . - I love my wife . - So we got a course set ? - We do . Took creative navigating , but we should make it to Greenleaf without running afoul of Alliance patrols . - Or a living soul , for that matter . - The way it should be . Of course , what should be an 18-hour trip will take us the better part of a week by this route . We 're in no rush . I like an easy , languorous journey . Gee , I wonder what that would be like . Let me help you with that . It 's your turn . My turn ? Shepherd told us a funny story about being a preacher . Now you tell us a funny story about being a doctor . A funny story . Yeah , because sick people are hilarious . Well , they ... They can be . Uh ... Well , in fact , I remember this time I was working the ER and this ... This , uh ... This fellow , this , uh , you know , upright sort of citizen he comes in , and he 's , you know , complaining ... Inara , she 's gotta have some funny whoring stories , I 'd wager . Oh , do I ever . Funny and sexy . You have no idea . And you never will . I don 't discuss my clients . Aw , come on , Inara . Who 'd know ? You . A companion doesn 't kiss and tell . So there is kissing ? Hey , doc , I think Kaylee may need your help after all . Care to make the first incision , Dr. Tam ? - Happy birthday , Simon . ALL : Happy birthday ! This is , uh ... How did ... How 'd you know ? River , did you ... ? " Day " is a vestigial mode of time measurement based on solar cycles . It 's not applicable . I didn 't get you anything . Seems a fresh warrant for your arrest came up over the cortex . Had your birthday attached right to it . Really ? I hope you like it . Couldn 't get ahold of no flour , so it 's mostly protein . In fact , it 's pretty much what we just had for dinner . But I tried to get the frosting as chocolaty-tasting as possible , so ... Thank you . I 'm really ... I 'm very , very deeply moved . Thank you . Well , deeply move yourself to blow out them candles , so we can try a slice . Come on , doc . Give a good blow . What the hell was that ? Maybe just a hiccup . I 'll go check it out . - I 'll take a look at the helm . - Fire . Okay , right . - Zoe ! - Fire ! Fire ! Baby . You 've gotta talk to me . Seal off everything that leads below decks ! Do it now ! - Is she gonna be okay ? - I need my med kit . Not this way . We 've got fire . - Where do you think you 're going ? - Zoe 's been badly hurt . - I need my medical supplies . - Sorry , nobody leaves . - Everything 's sealed tight . - If you don 't let me go , she could die . I let you through , we all die . It 's okay . She 's in shock . I need to bring her vitals back up . - How bad is it ? - There 's no sign of burning . - It must be internal . I 'll do a scan . - Baby ? Zoe , can you hear me ? Zoe ? Come on , sweetheart . Zoe ? Come on , talk , baby . - Look at me , sweetheart . - Kaylee . Kaylee , look at me . I need you up in the engine room figuring out what caused this . She ain 't moving . Serenity 's not moving . I know it . Which is why we need to suss out what happened so we can get her going again . - Think you can do that ? - Yes , captain . That 's a good girl . Come on , baby . You 're strong , the strongest person I ever met . - You can do this . - Is she gonna make it ? - Please , I need to work . - Wash . - I need you on the bridge . - Zoe 's hurt . And the doctor 's gonna do everything he can . Meantime , I gotta have you on the bridge . We need to know how bad it is . How bad ? It 's bad , okay , sir ? My wife may be dying here , so my feeling is it 's pretty bad . - Wash ... - I 'm not leaving her side , Mal ! Don 't ask me again . I wasn 't asking . I was telling . You 're gonna get to that bridge , and you 're gonna get us back on our feet . Yeah . This is all very doable . Shouldn 't be a problem at all . A few modifications . Get some real maneuverability out of this boat . You 'd be surprised . So you 'll take the job then ? Might do , might do . - Think I 'm starting to get a feel here . - Good . Well , take your time . Make yourself to home . Just fiddle around with the dials there . We 'll be nearby . - Great , ain 't he ? - I don 't like him . - What ? - Just something about him bothers me . - What ? What about him bothers you ? - I 'm not sure . It 's something . Your something comes up against a list of recommendations as long as my leg . Tanaka raves about this guy . Renshaw 's been trying to get him for a month . - And we need us a pilot . - I understand , sir . He bothers me . We finally got ourselves a genius mechanic . It 's time we hired someone to fly this . Genius ? No one 's ever called me that before . Shiny . He just bothers me . Her heart stopped . Someone should get her husband down here . - No . What do you need , doc ? - That drawer , right there . - That 's the one . - What is it ? Pure adrenaline . Cap ? Zoe gonna be okay ? You let the doctor worry about Zoe . Come on . Tell me what you know . Catalyzer on the port compression coil blew . - It 's where the trouble started . - I need that in captain dummy-talk . - We 're dead in the water . - Can you fix it ? - I can try . - Just get us to limping . That 's all I need . What ? What is it ? - It 's worse than just the coil . - How can it be worse ? Main life-support 's down since the engine 's dead . - But we 've got auxiliary life-support . - No , we don 't . Ain 't even on . Explosion must 've knocked it out . So , what are we breathing ? Whatever got pumped into the atmo before the explosion shut it all down . Most of that oxygen got ate up by the fire on its way out the door . Well , whatever 's left is what we got . How long ? Couple of hours , maybe . We 'll start to feel it , and then we won 't feel nothing at all . How is she ? She 's still unconscious , but her vitals are strong . She won 't know it , but as long as her condition remains like this she 'll outlive us all . She 's using less oxygen . I always thought the name Serenity had a vaguely funereal sound to it . I love this ship . I have from the first moment I saw it . I just don 't want to die on it . I don 't want to die at all . Suffocation 's not exactly the most dignified way to go . The human body will ... Please , I don 't really require a clinical description right now . I 'm sorry . I just ... It was my birthday . Don 't be afraid . That 's what it says . " Don 't be afraid " . Yes . But you are afraid . Yes . You 're afraid we 're going to run out of air that we 'll die gasping . But we won 't . That 's not going to happen . We 'll freeze to death first . You get that beacon sent ? - Yeah , it 's sent . - Good . Pointless . - What ? - Nothing , sir . It 's a brilliant plan . I 'm sure we 'll all be saved . I 'm getting a little weary of this attitude . Are you ? Well , I 'm so very sorry , sir . I guess the news that we 'll be purple , bloated and fetal in a few hours has made me a little snippy . It 's possible someone might pick up that signal . No , Mal , it 's not possible . No one 's gonna pick up the damn signal . You wanted us under the radar . That 's where we are . - Out of range of anyone . - Then make it go further . - I ... What ? - Make the signal go further . I can 't make it go further . Not if you 're gonna sit around and whinge . - What do you expect me to do , Mal ? - Whatever you have to . If you can 't do it here , get a suit on and go outside the boat ... And what ? Wave my arms around ? Wave your arms around . Jump up and down . Divert the nav sats to the transmitter . Divert the ... Right ! Teenage pranks are fun when you 're about to die . - Give the beacon a boost , wouldn 't it ? - Yes , Mal , it would boost the signal . But even if a passerby did receive , it would muck up their navigation . - Could be that 's true . - Damn right ! They 'd be forced to stop and dig out our signal before they could go anyplace . Maybe I should do that then . - Maybe you should . - Okay . - Good ! - Fine ! What do you two think you 're doing , fighting at a time like this ? You 're gonna use up all the air . Life-support failure . Check oxygen levels at once . Life-support failure . Check oxygen levels at once . Bester ? What 's this I hear about yet another delay ? Supposed to have this engine fixed and us up and ... What in the name of ... ? Bester ? Bester ? Bester ! What ? You do realize we 've been parked on this rock a week longer than we planned ? Yeah , but there 's ... There 's stuff to do . As , for example , that job we 've got waiting for us on Pacquin . When we landed , you said you needed a few days to get us space-worthy and is there something wrong with your bunk ? What ? Oh , no , captain . She likes engines . They make her hot . Bester , get your prairie harpy off my boat and put us back in the air . Okay , but can 't . - What do you mean , " can 't " ? - No can do , cap . - Secondary grav boot 's shot . - No , it ain 't . Ain 't nothing wrong with your grav boot . Grav boot 's just fine . Hello . She doesn 't ... That 's not what it ... No , it ain 't . Sure it is . Grav boot ain 't your trouble . I seen the trouble plain as day when I was down there on my back before . Your reg couple 's bad . The reg ... The what ? The reg couple . Right here . See ? - No . - This . I 'm pointing right at it . BESTER : Hey . Here . Hand me that , will you ? Don 't serve much of a purpose anyway . Just tends to gum up the works when it gets tacked . So I figure why even have one ? Better to just take your G-line , plug it straight into the port pin-lock and that should ... There ! - What 'd you do ? - She fixed it . Well , it wasn 't really broke . Where 'd you learn to do that , miss ? Just do it , that 's all . - Daddy says I got natural talent . - I 'll say you do . - Don 't we need this ? - You work for your daddy , do you ? When he got work , which ain 't too often lately . You got experience with a vessel like this ? I never even been up in one before . Wanna ? - You mean ... ? - Sure . - For how long ? - Long as you like . - Long as you can keep her in the sky . - You offering me a job ? - What ? - Believe I just did . I just gotta ask my folks . Don 't leave without me . Mal , what do you need two mechanics for ? I really don 't . Kaylee ? Kaylee , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry , captain . I 'm real sorry . I should 've kept better care of her . Usually she lets me know when something 's wrong . Maybe she did , I just wasn 't paying attention , or ... Kaylee , I cannot be having this from you right now . We got work to do . Catalyzer 's broke . Gonna need a new one . There is no new one . You gotta make do with what you got . - It 's broke . - Come on . This the part ? It don 't hardly seem like nothing . All right . Where does it go ? Here . But it don 't fit no more . Well , you gotta figure a way to make it fit . Sometimes a thing gets broke can 't be fixed . Without this , the engine don 't turn ? Engine don 't turn , life-support won 't function . We don 't breathe . You wanna keep breathing , don 't you ? So do I. Life-support failure . Check oxygen levels at once . Life-support failure . Check oxygen levels at once . Well , as you 're all keenly aware , we 've run into a bit of a situation . Engine 's down , life-support 's on the fritz and I got nine people here all wanting to breathe . Truth is , don 't got a whole lot of options at this juncture . So instead of focusing on what we don 't got , time to talk about what it is we do . And what we got are two shuttles . Short-range , won 't get far . But each got heat , and they each got air . Last longer than what 's left on Serenity . - Long enough to reach someplace ? - No . So where will we go then ? Far as you can get . We send both shuttles in opposite directions betters the chances of someone getting picked up . Shepherd Book , Kaylee , Jayne will ride with Inara in her shuttle . Doc , you and your sis will ride with Wash and Zoe seeing as how Zoe still needs some doctoring . What about you ? Four people per shuttle . That 's the arrangement . Evens the odds . I 'm staying with Serenity . - Captain ... - We sent out a beacon . Even managed to boost it a little . If by some chance we get a response someone 's gonna have to be here to answer . Let 's get those shuttles prepped . Wash , shuttles are that way . I know . But like you said , someone might answer the beacon . And when they do , I wanna make sure that you can call everyone back . Won 't take but a minute . Jayne , get shuttle number two ready . I 'll see to Inara 's . Let 's get moving . Take only what you need . - Mal ... - lf you fly smart , don 't push too hard ... - ... shuttle life-support will last . - This isn 't the ancient sea . Don 't go down with your ship . She ain 't going down . She ain 't going anywhere . Jayne 'll be valuable if you 're in trouble . Don 't trust him . Don 't let him take over . You 're paid for the month . It 's your ship . Mal . As far as your security deposit goes , that I might have to owe you . Well , here she is . Nice , ain 't she ? - Smallish . - Well , not overly . How much room do you really need for what you do anyway ? I got a surveyor and his wife interested in renting it . They 're just waiting to hear back . - What 's her range ? - Standard short . She 'll break atmo from a wide orbit get you where you need to go , bring you back home again . She 's space-worthy , just like the rest of Serenity is . No need to sound so defensive , captain . I prefer something with a few miles on it . Were we to enter into this arrangement , captain there are a few things I would require from you the foremost being complete autonomy . This shuttle would be my home . No crew member would be allowed entrance without my invitation . You 'd get your privacy . And just so we 're clear under no circumstances will I service you or anyone who is under your employ . I 'll post a sign . That won 't be necessary . The other thing I insist upon is some measure of assurance that when I make an appointment , I 'm in position to keep that appointment , so far as such assurances are possible on a vessel of this type . That 's an awful lot of caveats and addendums there . As I stated , I just want to be clear . I 'll take that into consideration while I review the applications . Don 't be ridiculous . You 're gonna rent this shuttle to me . - Am I ? - Yes . And for one-quarter less than your asking price . - That a fact ? - It is . And you figure you 'll be getting this discount why , exactly ? You want me . You want me on your ship . - Do I ? - Yes . Because I can bring something your surveyor or any of the other fish you might have on line can 't : - A certain respectability . - Respecta ... And based on what little I 've seen of your operation I suspect that 's something you could use . Fine . Let me ask you this . If you 're so respectable , why are you even here ? I mean , I 've heard tell of fancy ladies such as yourself shipping out with big luxury liners and the like but a registered companion on a boat like this ? - What are you running from ? - I 'm not running from anything . If it 's Alliance trouble , you might want to consider another ship . Some here fought for the Independents . The Alliance has no quarrel with me . I supported Unification . Did you ? Well , I don 't suppose you 're the only whore that did . Oh , one further addendum . That 's the last time you get to call me whore . Absolutely . Never again . Keep everything set as low as possible . Don 't waste what you got . Let me do that . You never could operate this thing . And try not to talk . Talking uses up air . Ain 't no need for it . Mal , come with us . Can 't . Four to a shuttle , Inara . Four . One more . It can 't make a difference , not now . I 'm not leaving Serenity . Mal , you don 't have to die alone . Everybody dies alone . - Everything 's set and ready . - Good . I linked the nav systems of both shuttles into the helm here . When your miracle gets here , pound this button once . It 'll call back both shuttles . Go see to your wife . I went ahead and closed off all below-deck vents diverted what 's left to the bridge . Ain 't much . My advice is seal off everything behind you on your way back up . Might buy you some time . And I prepped a suit for you . It 's hanging in the foredeck . - So when the time comes ... - I won 't be needing it , but thanks . Okay . Well . Firefly ... Your distress ... Firefly Serenity ... I 'm sorry for your troubles , captain . They sound many . But you do understand , I can 't invite you aboard my vessel . - I don 't know you . - I ain 't asking for a ride , just a push . Right . Your mechanical trouble . Your compression coil , you say ? - It was the catalyzer . - Not even the coil . - Catalyzer 's a nothing part , captain . - It 's nothing till you don 't got one . Then it appears to be everything . Well , it is possible we might have something that could do you . We just come from a big salvage mission off Ita Moon . - I 'd appreciate it . - Trouble is how can I know for certain your story 's true ? Ambush could be waiting for me and my people on the other side . You can plainly see my shuttles have been launched , just like I said . And by now you 've scanned me . You know I got no life-support . I don 't expect to see any weapons when we board . And I do expect to see that engine part before I open the door . I feel like maybe we can do business . Check him . Search the ship . Start with the cockpit and work your way down . - Is this what you meant by ambush ? - I 'm just verifying your story . If you find anybody on board not supposed to be , you shoot them . I thought we were gonna be reasonable about this . Reason . He 's gonna talk to us about reason now . Yeah , that 's a joke . - Which one you figure tracked us ? - The ugly one , sir . - Could you be more specific ? - Do we look reasonable to you ? Well , looks can be deceiving . Not as deceiving as a low-down , dirty deceiver . Well said . Wasn 't that well said , Zoe ? Had a kind of poetry to it , sir . You want I should shoot them now , Marco ? Wait till they tell us where they put the stuff . That 's a good idea . Good idea . Tell us where the stuff 's at , so I can shoot you . Point of interest . Offering to shoot us might not work so well as an incentive as you might imagine . Anyway , we 've hidden it . So you kill us , you 'll never find it . Found you easy enough . Yeah , you did , didn 't you ? How much they paying you ? Huh ? I mean , let 's say you did kill us or didn 't . There could be torture , whatever . But somehow , you found the goods . - What would your cut be ? - Seven percent , straight off the top . Seven ? Huh . - What ? - Hm ? Nothing . Not a thing . No , I just ... - Does that seem low to you ? - It does . - That ain 't low . - Stop it . - Seven percent 's standard . - Okay . Zoe , I 'm paying you too much . - What does she get ? - Knock it off ! Forget I said anything . I 'm sure you 're treated well . You get the perks , got your own room . No ? You share a bunk ? With that one . - Really ? - Jayne , this ain 't funny . - Yeah , I ain 't laughing . - You move on over to this side we 'll not only show you where the stuff 's at we 'll see to it you get your fair share . Not no sad seven . - Private room ? - Jayne ! Your own room , full run of the kitchen . Jayne , I ain 't asking ... Shut up . How big a room ? Ship 's clear , captain . You check the engine room ? Just like he said , the catalyzer 's blown . That 's all he needs . Anything that 's worth anything is right here in this cargo bay . So you take a look around , decide what you think is fair . Already decided . We 're taking your ship . Billy , get this plugged in . Jesse , call Stern over here . You 're gonna pilot this pile of gosa out of here . We 'll get it as far as ... Jesse , don 't call Stern . Billy , leave the catalyzer . Do as he says . Take your people and go . You would 've done the same . We can already see I haven 't . Now get the hell off my ship . Life-support failure . Check oxygen levels at once . Life-support failure . Check oxygen levels at once . Life-support failure . Check oxygen levels at once . - Real beauty . - Serenity 's not moving . - When your miracle gets here ... - Come with us . Everybody dies alone . I 'll run up and scrape off a piece . - You 'd do that for me ? - I 'd do anything for you . I don 't think it 's something he should see when he wakes up . Welcome back , sir . - I go someplace ? - Very nearly . We thought we 'd lost you . I 've been right here . - Wash , you okay ? - Yeah , Mal , I 'm fine . - You got a thing in your arm . - Yeah . Try not to speak . You 're heavily medicated and you 've lost a lot of blood . I thought I ordered you all off the ship . - I call you back ? - No , Mal , you didn 't . I take full responsibility , captain . The decision saved your life . Won 't happen again , sir . Good . And thanks . I 'm grateful . It was my pleasure , sir . Hey , we 'd have been back first except there 's something wrong with Inara 's shuttle . She done something to it . Smells funny . - I told you , that 's incense . - So you say . - Hey , captain . - Hey . You fixed the ship . Good work . - Thanks . - All right . I have to insist , the captain needs to rest . Yeah . I think the doc might not be wrong about that one . Just gonna need a few ... You all gonna be here when I wake up ? We 'll be here . Good . That 's good . Yep . Real beauty , ain 't she ? Yes , sir , a right smart purchase , this vessel . I 'll tell you what , you buy this ship , treat her proper she 'll be with you for the rest of your life . Son ? Hey , son ? You hear a word I 've been saying ?

 Aeryn . She 's carrying my child . My-my DNA . Aeryn isn 't sure if the child is John Crichton 's . A relationship it 's based on trust . I 'm so sorry . Who saved your life , who ? I did . What 's he doing here ? He wants asylum . Asylum ? I gave my word that he would not be harmed . Put your weapons down . Why did you come here ? To safeguard John Crichton , amongst other things . I will find them again and when I do , they will pay for this humiliation . Distillate of Laka . One whiff , and the pain is gone . For a time . It 'll help you forget about Aeryn . And now , on Farscape . Yo , Pilot , you there ? Testing , one , two , three , uno , dos , tres . Pilot , I got a ton of groceries to unload . Pilot ? Damn , I figured they 'd be in range . Are you eager to see the others again ? Naw , it hadn 't been that long . Still , you miss Aeryn . Or don 't you ? Damn , it 's been a few arns since I thought about her . Then my remedy must be working . Take it for as long as you need it . Ah , I don 't ... I don 't need it . Just takes the edge off . Crichton ? Pilot , there you are . It 's about time . Hey look , get all the hands down to the hangar . I got a boatload of crap for you guys . Unfortunately , nobody is available to assist you at the moment . Well , what are they doing ? Watching Jeopardy ? Captain James T. D 'Argo ! Ka D 'Argo is currently helping Rygel with his ... laundry , and Aeryn 's writing some ... poetry . Uh-huh . What about , ah , Chiana and Sikozu ? Enjoying each other 's company . Preparing a meal for ... everyone but Rygel . He 's ... not hungry . Right , well tell ' em to save me a plate . I 'm starving . Pod out . Now isn 't that lovely . Everyone is getting on so well ? Oh , crickets . Something 's wrong . Maybe the game 's not over with or Scorpy 's really loose on the ship . Bingo . Moya 's got gate crashers . An unprecedented reward is offered for information leading to the capture of John Crichton . If he is taken alive , 15 million currency pledges . If dead ... Bay Two . Acknowledged . Prepare loading Bay Two for landing . Crichton . I 've ... prepared Bay Two for landing . Yeah , just give me a minute to get these crates locked down . My mixture is ready . You sure you 're gonna be okay out there ? This will keep me in a vacuum coma for at least three arns . It 's most relaxing . You should try it sometime . No , thanks . I 'm not a big fan of vacuum . Stand ready . He 'll dock within 30 microns . Wait . His approach vector 's wrong . Evacuate our boarding craft . We 're coming under attack . Full defensive alert . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . He 's destroyed our boarding craft . I begin to see why his bounty 's so high . Keep searching all tiers . He 's aboard somewhere . Nobody could have survived that explosion . Crichton must be dead . Prak ! Crichton 's alive . And ingenious . Tier nine clear , moving to tier ten . Who the frell are you ? Your captor . Only temporarily . Let 's not prolong this . Tell Crichton to come to the Command . Tell him yourself . The longer it takes for me to capture Crichton , the greater the likelihood that one of you will be damaged . Well , there 's no likelihood we 're going to help you . You 're certain you won 't cooperate ? Why don 't you undo these cuffs and just see how much I wanna cooperate ? - Leave him alone . - You gain nothing . Probably , but it costs me nothing . I could improve those hideous Luxan features . That would be messier than pain cuffs , but far more entertaining . Crichton , surrender at once . You won 't be harmed . We want you alive . But if you resist , we 'll take it out on your shipmates . Like so . Sir , nothing can be salvaged of our boarding craft . Shall I re-enable one of the Transport Pods ? No . It 's slow and weaponless . We 'd be a target for every other bounty hunter in the sector . I 'll send a transmission to the Command Carrier requesting pickup . It 's too soon . We 'll tell Grayza to come for us only when we have captured Crichton . As you wish . Silence . You have something ? Maybe . Aeryn , you know what , I think we should negotiate . No , I really think we should negotiate . Right . Silence ! It 's no good . He 's gone . But we know he 's in the ducts . We could pursue him up there . Only by making ourselves too vulnerable . No , we 'll draw him out . Bring him to us . Search this Tier . Mm-hmm . You know your comrade . Tell me which one of you does he care for most ? Me , of course . Aeryn , of course , probably Chiana next . Where will Crichton go now ? Center Chamber for a nice , hot raslak . He 'll go to his quarters , gather all his weapons . That Tarkan Shield Belt should help the odds . Then he 'll head for Pilot 's Den . What are you staring at , Drennak ? Find Crichton 's quarters . Search for weapons and a shielding device . - Crichton 's quarters . - Acknowledged . He 'll also try to free the pilot . Isn 't that right , Crichton ? Secure the Pilot 's Den . Be ready . Got it . Hey , if I could distract him , can you make a break for it ? You know , that run on walls trick thing ? Ya know ? Go hide in the Neural Cluster or something ? Not with these frelling cuffs on , I can 't . These what cuffs ? I am so glad we extended your vocabulary . Listen . Play along . Oh , okay . I have a very compelling argument for letting us go . Hey . Soldier boy . Come here . Hey , don 't you get hot in that armor ? Are you trying to entice me ? Maybe . If I wanted you . I 'd take you . Should I show you ? - Yeah . Leave her alone . Or maybe both of you . No , please ! Don 't hurt them . Quiet . Report . Any sign of Crichton ? - I 'm in his quarters . - He hasn 't come near . Scorp ? Scorpius , you son of a bitch . 1812 . Playing possum , huh ? You think you can get any of your brothers up and running ? Good boy . Be quiet , though . No singing . I 'm gonna go scrounge up a blunderbuss . Oh , relax . You 'll see Crichton sooner or later . A microt before he kills you . I admire such confidence from the weak and helpless . John . I 'm not your enemy . Be calm . Oh , I 'm calm . I 'm just a little twitchy 'cause , uh , you sold us out . Nothing of the kind . What , it 's just coinkidink you 're running on the loose ? The only reason I escaped capture is because the bounty hunters do not know I 'm here . By the time they went to my cell I was not in it . Now how 'd that happen ? Oh , I know , I know . We forgot to lock the door . The cell door was wholly inadequate . What you saying ? You opened it with your bare hands ? Gloved hands , yes . You mean you could 've got out anytime you wanted ? I never wanted to . But by the time our attackers arrived , I had to . Whoever they are , they have managed to capture Moya 's crew in a matter of microts . But they must not capture you . I don 't cut and run . We could not run if we wished . They 've immobilized all escape craft with magnetic locks , And disabled the DRDs , all except for that one . Yep , 1812 's on a different wavelength . He 's not from Moya . But if he restarts the others , we 'll have more firepower . Don 't have time for that . I 'm going ... wabbit hunting . You can 't take them all at once . How dumb do you think I am ? You take ' em down one by one , the Die Hard way . By luring them into an ambush . You could do with some assistance . You really think our relationship ... has progressed that far ? Just remember whose side you 're on . This is John Crichton , paging the head Cylon . Pick up the phone , Imperious Leader . Crichton . How pleasant to hear from you . Let 's have a little chat . First off , money . We can pay you more than the Peacekeepers will . No deal . Surrender at once . And why would I do that ? To reduce the suffering of your crewmates . It 's the only choice you have . Don 't doubt for a microt that you will be captured . You know , for a guy with no mouth you sure talk big . Brilliant . Why don 't you come down here and find me , Gort ? Klaatu barada niktu . Mission accomplished , John . Screw you . He 's on a lower tier , somewhere in the atmospheric system . Check all the airflow chambers . Are you looking for someone ? Thank you , John . Como estas , la cucaracha . You didn 't expect me to give ya a loaded weapon , did ya ? Well , yes . Let 's have a look at this guy . Damn , what the hell 's this ? It 's like ... Mr. Pumpkinhead . Organic core . Bioengineered armor shell . Crunchy on the outside , chewy on the inside . How are your ribs ? As if you cared . My armor worked , barely . One down . Five to go . And you have a weapon that works . Nope , this bazooka 's out of ammo . You can have it . I may well have joined the wrong side . Dead ? How ? Multiple blasts from a large-yield weapon . So . Crichton 's more formidable than I thought . I told you , but would you listen ? No . They never listen . Not too late to cut your losses and run . Oh , it 's still early . Initiate the containment plan . All right , I got Wynonna , an extra Pulse Pistol , two Pulse Rifles , two DRDs , maybe four . Eight , 16 , or 64 , it won 't be enough . Well , there 's always the pulse chamber overload trick . If you can lure them close enough . I 'm gonna need a volunteer for a dangerous mission . The torment continues . No one asked you . You , get to your feet . What are you going to do with them ? I told you to be silent . What the frell ? Get up . Weâ   re not going for a little walk , are we ? Something like that . Hey , hey , frellnik . Uh , before you do whatever you 've got in mind , let 's talk . If this is about currency , I assure you that I can more than match whatever you 're being paid for me . Aah ! Delivering you dead would cost me , but it might just be worth it . Tell Crichton what you just witnessed . Crichton , don 't talk , just listen . They 've somehow reduced D 'Argo in size . He 's alive , but he 's no larger than a hand length , and he 's imprisoned inside the head bounty hunter . And the rest of your crewmates will follow . So put away your weaponry . Killing one of us means you 'll be killing one or more of your friends . Do you understand ? Aeryn 's right . Don 't answer . Keep them guessing . You see how hopeless it is ? Face the inevitable . Give yourself up . Crichton , the device appears to be activated by a combination of numbers on the handset . I 'm told you care for her . So stop fighting and you 'll save her life . You can 't even consider giving up . Grayza will not let any of you live . I 'm not giving up . And you 're the one that looks like crap . Oh , don 't worry about me . I 'm merely overheating . So we 've gone from Die Hard to Honey , I Shrunk the Hostages . Unless that guy is bluffing Aeryn . I don 't think so . Forgive me . My mind isn 't clear , but I seem to recall a Peacekeeper file about a species called the Coreeshi . These are our pumpkin people ? Oh , yes . Capable of constructing organic shells in various forms . They also were reputed to possess reduction technology . Great . So now I 've gotta take these guys down and I can 't hurt ' em . I 'm sure that point is a bluff . To keep their prisoners alive containment must be almost impossible to damage . Can 't take that chance . Is there another choice ? Wake up . Hynerian , wake up ! My name isn 't Hynerian . It 's Rygel the Sixteenth . You may call me Dominar . This is scarcely the time to obsess about how you 're addressed . Look around you . One more prison . So what ? I 've seen far worse . Do you have any idea how small you are ? You 're not exactly a giant yourself . You have been reduced in size . You 're hardly bigger than a filima bug now . Except ... except this can 't be happening . Can 't it ? No . No . Reduction by proportionally subtracting atoms would leave our brains too simple to function . So , maybe they just made all our atoms smaller . But then we couldn 't breathe normal size air molecules , don 't you see ? No . No , this ... this isn 't happening because it is not possible . Your brain isn 't functioning . Do you think this is all just a hallucination ? Do you like that explanation better , hmm ? No . But I simply cannot comprehend how that ... - Neither can I. Who cares ? We 're here , they did it , and that 's that . You consider yourself intelligent ? Yes , I do . Then stop behaving like a child . I am not a child ! No , you 're an infant . You 've studied , but you haven 't experienced . You know nothing of life . And you do ? I 've been around long enough to know how ignorant I am . I don 't assume the universe obeys my preconceptions . Ha ! But I know a frelling fact when it hits me in the face . That 's good work . You 're smoking . You know that 's not good for you . The replacement cooling rod Sikozu has formulated does not function as well in times of exertion . Then don 't exert . Hit the bench . Go on . How did you survive this far ? Charm . Good looks . A winning attitude . Here we go . And batter up . 1812 , don 't cut it loose till I give you the signal . I 'm hearing something on Tier 16 , treblin side . I 'll check it out . Negative . Hold position . Devvak , you go in first . Acknowledged . Come out , Crichton . I have Aeryn and Chiana . If you destroy me , you destroy them . And you certainly won 't destroy me with that . Pulse chamber overload . Hmm . Not very creative . 1812 . Bear trap . Ugly but creative . And that is how we survived . The containment capsule is here . 1812 , light it up . What 's that ? What 's going on ? Contact lost on Tier 16 . All hands get down there now . There 's no more time . Take this . - We 're out . - Crichton 's got us out . Aeryn , Pip , you okay ? Oh , yeah . - Yes . Over here . Run for it ! Save them ! 1812 . This way . - Whoa ! Pick it up . Pick it up ! Go , John . Go ! Who is he ? Do you think he 's worth anything ? Either he 's worth something , or he 's dead . Are you guys all right ? Where are we ? I can 't see . You 're out of the bounty hunter 's body . But you 're still tiny , and you 're stuck in the beer can . And since these cuffs are magnetic , we 're not going anywhere in a hurry . Right . First priority , we get you guys out of there . No , first priority is rescuing the others . We can wait . Right . Gonna need a new plan . I 'm on it . Crichton . Congratulations on retrieving the females . I assume they 're alive and intact . Of course , you can 't set them free nor restore their size without my help . I understand you care for them . I offer a deal . Turn yourself in and I 'll restore their size and set them free . Hey , why are you suddenly feeling so generous ? You 're costing me bodies and time . I 'll pass up the bounties I 'd earn on the females in exchange for you . And what about the others ? I 'm not that generous . Maybe you 'll feel more generous after you 've lost a few pints of your own blood . You know where the others are ? I saw Sikozu get shrunk but I didn 't see where they put her . Same for D 'Argo and Rygel . I ... I used my visions . Everything slowed down and I know ... I know how they do the shrinking . How 's that ? The armor . Left arm . There 's a keypad . I know the codes for shrinking , and I ... I know the codes to get the cuffs off . That 's good work , Chi . It 's too bad we don 't have some of that armor ourselves . Mmm . - What do we have ? We got you , me , a couple of DRDs and some weapons that only tickle the bad guys . What happened to the old woman ? Any idea who he is ? No . He was working with Crichton ? He 's the only reason Crichton got away . Crichton was hit in the leg . He was leaking vital fluids in the passageway . If you can 't capture a wounded target , you 'll be leaking vital fluids as well . Get moving ! Well , well . Scorpius . How 's the ride ? We 're all right . I 'm still blind . Maybe ... maybe it won 't go away . It 's okay . Your sight 's always come back before . Maybe this is one time too many . What ... what if it doesn 't come back ? Well , using your sight the way you did may be the only thing that saves us . Without those codes we 'll never return to normal size . It 's just the dark . You don 't know what 's coming , and , uh ... there 's nothing you can do . I hate that feeling . Wake up . Why are you here ? Because you captured me . So , you know . Did you think that armor would fool me ? I know what you are . Then you should bow down . Entropy will claim the universe before I bow down to a Scarran . Even one of the Ruling Order ? Particularly the Ruling Order . Grafting yourself into Coreeshi exoskeleton ? How ingenious . Yes . How many Peacekeepers have dealt with you not knowing you were a Scarran spy ? Too many to count . You 're not after Crichton for the bounty . You want to take him back to your masters . We 're eager to learn why both you and Commandant Grayza are so interested in him . But capturing you is a bonus beyond measure . It shall be my honor to return you to your birthplace . It will be my honor to see you dead . Not likely . Ka-tow ! Ka-tow ! Uh ! Yeah . That 's gonna work . All right . I got the plan . How 's my breath ? Death by laser guillotine . Four DRDs , clothesline the suckers . And not harm their captives ? Might work . Probably won 't . Don 't be small-minded . Chiana , how are the peepers ? Good . Making out colors and shapes . Right . Well , you two talk amongst yourselves . I got work to do . Crichton ! - Faster ! Sorry about that . Enjoy the ride , Scorpius . Ka D 'Argo , overcome your lethargy now . Moya 's crew is in danger . Where the frell are we and what are you doing here ? You have a Comms ? Signal Crichton immediately . Answers first . All right . All the brothers down with the plan ? Be quiet . How my little inaction figures ? I can see , but it 's ... it 's all blurry . Right . If I get the time , I 'll do something about that . After I release two of your arms , you 'll open an encoded channel on a vector and frequency I designate . If you do anything else , I 'll kill you and then this Leviathan . I 'll do as you say . A Scarran spy ? He intends to capture Crichton . Not for the Peacekeepers , but for the Scarrans . Crichton needs to know this . He cannot fall into Scarran hands . Why should I believe you ? Wait . Scarran military code . He 's signaling to a Dreadnought , to come get him and his prisoners . Bounty hunters may have spared Moya . The Scarrans won 't . John ? John , can you hear me ? - Yeah . Hidey ho , D. Where are you ? I 'm fine , in some sort of cylindrical prison . Look , it doesn 't matter . Can you trust Scorpius ? More today than yesterday . Why ? He thinks we might have a Scarran on our hands . And that the Scarran 's calling in a Dreadnought . Interesting . That could be useful . Thanks . John , the Scarran 's forcing Pilot to transmit the message now . Right . Keep me posted . Found him . Cargo Bay , Tier 20 . I 've got treblin side . You take hamman side . Watch for traps . Almost in position . Go in ten microts . Oh , crap . Best laid plans . Oh . Oh hell , this is gonna hurt . We 've got Crichton . Tier 20 . Cargo Bay . Hold him there . I 'll come shortly . No acknowledgment of my signal ? Not yet . What was that ? They ... they said they had Crichton . Maybe it 's part of the trap . I hope it 's part of the trap . Henchmen . Always the last to know and the first to get hurt . Got some bad news for you guys . Your , uh , boss . He 's not a battlebot . He 's a Scarran . Ridiculous . Yeah ? Well take the can opener to him , find out for yourself . But you better do it quick , because he 's just called for a Dreadnought to take him back to Scarranburg . All right . Go check it out . He 's in Pilot 's Den right now . Well , why don 't you have Pilot play back the message , and you can have your chief explain why he 's talking in Scarran . Fellas , I got no axe to grind . Peacekeepers , Scarrans , I 'm dead either way . You guys , crap , man . You oughta be concerned . What 's it gonna cost you to check it out ? Nothing . If I 'm lying , you can take it out of my hide . But if I 'm telling the truth , yeah , we 're gonna smoke the peace pipe . Watch him . Axikor . What are you doing here ? Open your armor . Why ? To prove you 're a Coreeshi and not a Scarran . Don 't be foolish . Open it . Now ! Aah . Man , I hope you guys are still under warranty . 1812 , get these arms off , quick . You killed him . You can be next . Transmission ? Yes . Axikor . Mra zenab prant kebof ... That a girl . All right , Chiana , start teaching me those combinations . Will do . ... jarj branek vol skarn ... The Dreadnought signals that it won 't risk traveling to Moya . Not with a Command Carrier in the area . That 's good . He 's been ordered to make his own way off Moya , and to rendezvous with the Dreadnought elsewhere . Well , that 's bad . Oh , God , it 's still warm . Okay . Uh , nurse , I am , uh , ready for surgery . First thing , the cuffs . So far , so good . Excellent . Oh . Beer can 's next . Damn . No winners there . Hey ! Crichton ! - How about that ? I got a tadpole . Crichton , get us out of here . Make us normal size . Please ! Don 't know about that , Rygel . Chiana only gave me the codes for making things smaller , not bigger . I don 't wanna blow you up . John . John , we 're on the move again . I think the Scarran 's trying to make a run for it . He may try and steal a Transport Pod . Actually , if he wants something faster , he might try and steal Aeryn 's Prowler . Frell . Right . I 'll try to cut him off at the pass . 1812 , keep an eye on the little people . He 'll never beat the Scarran to the Prowler . Hey , where are ya going ? Sit tight . Yo ! Crichton ! I 'll disable the Prowler . You take care of the Scarran . Fire ! You should pick on somebody your own size . Hiya , fellas . John ! Whoa ! John ! Crichton . Excellent . Scorpius will have someone to keep him company on his journey . Where ? Back to Scarranburg ? I don 't think so . Get big code . You 're mine now . Crap . I hope I can do this . So , you 're an upper-class Scarran ? Not like the horse faces I 'm used to . You 'll soon be meeting more of me . Remind me to shave . No ! One small step for man . Donde esta la cucaracha ? John , what the frell are we gonna do with Scorpius ? Man , I just don 't know . He could have gone to ground , but he didn 't . He put his ass on the line for us , I guess . I don 't know . I just ... - John ... I just , don 't know . D , look . Bottom line . I don 't think we have a cage that 's gonna hold the son of a bitch . I agree with you on all counts . - Yeah . We should still keep a close eye on him at all times . 24 / 7 . Crichton ? Yeah , Ryg . There 's a wrinkled old woman floating outside the Forward Portal . Whoa , gigantic oops . Can you do me a favor ? Pop outside the Tier Three treblin side hatch and haul Granny in ? Noranti is outside ? Yeah . Don 't ... don 't ask . She ... she 's got some red Play-Doh in her pocket . A dose of that , and when she gets in she should be all right . It 's taken care of . Officer Sun . Yes , Pilot . Commander Crichton and I would like your advice before we broach a topic with Captain D 'Argo . Go ahead . In view of the continuing danger we face in Peacekeeper space , and even in the Uncharted Territories , and given that the Scarrans will also be looking for us now , I 'm reluctantly forced to consider traveling into Tormented Space . Aeryn , you know what that is ? Aeryn ? Um ... it 's a place where neither Peacekeepers nor Scarrans will travel . Right . It 's a rough neighborhood . Bit hard to know . Few credible reports have made it back from there , since ... those who go there usually vanish . Navigation there is extremely hazardous . Many ships have been lost . The area is reputed to be a nexus of wormholes . So I 've been told . And Moya 's cool with that ? She 's understandably reticent to go there . But she sees no other choice . Nor do I , Pilot . Well look on the bright side . Can 't be as bad as some of the places we 've been lately . Trust me . It can .

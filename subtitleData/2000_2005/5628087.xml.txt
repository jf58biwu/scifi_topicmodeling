 There wasn 't always a war with the Centauri but in my lifetime , it 's all I 've ever known . By the year 2050 , six years after the first attack we 'd lost so many things . We 'd lost the sky to electromagnetic domes to shield the Earth from frequent air raids We 'd lost the uncovered cities that the government forgot . We 'd lost democracy to global leadership . We didn 't expect peace anymore with the Centauri because we came to see that peace wasn 't their goal . Their goal was Earth . The ultimate land war , with no boundaries . When I was a boy , I built toy rockets . I wanted to explore space and discover new worlds . I 've never seen a Centauri , but I knew what my father told me . I Knew they were genetically superior , and they came after us with no mercy . I also knew that was the last thing my father saw . I stopped building rockets ... There was no need for them . I build weapons instead . And I know my salvation . Her name ... Is Maya . IS THE YEAR 2079 A little warmer . That 's good . Music on . No , no . Something else . Hooker , John Lee . Ah , that 's good ! Go , Johnny Lee ! TV on . - Watch the news for me , will you ? - News Channel 3 . Hoping to catch a glimpse of their beloved leader hundreds of people have thronged the Ballard Space Port as citywide preparations - Spence , it 's on ! - Music off . Water off . ... last week 's brutal Centauri attack on the Tolstoy Colony of Asteroid X-83 . - What did I miss ? - Alighting from a recent briefing with high-ranking officials at Sector Eight the Chancellor visits our region for a secret meeting with government scientists . - Some secret . - Tolstoy colony ... was a bastion of peace and free expression in this grievous time of war . - Those who live there ... - Why do they leak these things ? They want us to think that she 's Joan of Arc and not some warmonger . Tonight , we 'll both be shaking hands with that warmonger . With one deadly strike Centauri stormtroopers annihilated this idyllic community . Well , I hope she likes talking politics . This war crime will be avenged . Firefighter robots have finally extinguished the blaze which has devastated Sutton Wood . Over 600 acres of forest were razed and authorities have closed off the area to all hikers and picnickers . The cause of the fire is unknown but careless campers are most likely to blame . - Good morning , Mr. Siegel . - Morning , Spence . - I don 't think they 'll get through the dome today . - They can , and they will , sir . They can and they will . A mob of raucous anti-war protesters clashed with military troops , leading to 50 arrests . The pacifists protesting Chancellor strategy ... Veterans Plaza . The station is Veterans Plaza . - I 'll see you tonight . - All right . THE PROJECT , RESEARCH SPECIAL Aramas Morning . - Good morning , Nelson . How you doing ? - I am " high quality " . - So tonight 's the big night , huh ? - Huge . Nervous ? - No . - Decided what you 're going to wear tonight ? - Uh , no . - Don 't overthink it . Relax . I 'll give you a tip . She likes to be called Chancie and when you get right up next to her cup her right buttock in your hand and jiggle it really fast . She loves that . - Tight security this morning . - I guess Chancie 's a little paranoid . - So how 's my favorite girl ? - She 's beautiful as ever . - We went camping this weekend up in Sutton Woods . She loved it . - Lucky you missed the fire . Who says we missed the fire ? VETERANS HOSPITAL MEDICAL PORT SOUTH VETERANS HOSPITAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - I want you to double the dosages on your order estimates . - Yes , Doctor . And I want a nurse standing by until he stabilizes . - Yes . - How are we doing on synth plasma ? SR 's still waiting . Okay , well , I 'll just have to contact Central Supply and see if they send some in the next run . We 're way over capacity , Dr. Olham . If you want to keep inviting more wounded we 're going to have to move the party to your place . Ah , Dr. Carone , and I 'm barely awake . There 's another evac on its way here from Tolstoy . I 'd like to know why you told them we could handle them . - What do you suggest I do ? - We could ask evac to reroute . - Oh , to a worse hospital . - Forget it . I am all for the war effort . I 'm not interested in the war effort . I just care about saving as many women as I possibly can . - Morning Dr. Olham . Please enter . - What do you care about ? This morning I 'm saying good-bye to my youngest and he says - I swear to God - " Dada , when I grow up I want to be in waste management . " - You tell me , should I worry ? - Little Joey 's on the slow side , isn 't he . You know , I pray nights he marries well . There she is . Three years of hard labor . And now , you are the proud father of an 80-ton baby girl . - July 16 , 1945 , at 05 : 29 AM . - What ? Oppenheimer tests the first atomic bomb in Alamogordo , New Mexico . 3 weeks later , the weapon hits " ground zero " in Hiroshima , Japan ... wiping out 140,000 people . Oppenheimer sees the madness , and urges the UN to gain control of thermonuclear development . The government turns around and calls him a Communist sympathizer . And when it was all over , Einstein said ... Only two things are infinite , the universe and human stupidity ... And not sure about the the universe . What 's the matter with you ? - Nothing . - I 'd say it 's ambivalence . I don 't have that luxury , myself but then again , I see our people die every day . - Have we met ? - This weapon is a godsend . It Will ensure the preservation of our race and our faith . Right . - I work for the ESA . - The ESA ? You 're here because of the Chancellor . I 'm Major Hathaway . special unit enemy infiltration . What 's this about ? - Spence ! - I have it . What the hell are you doing ? Are you insane ? Do you know who this is ? - Get off me ! You 're dead ! - Take him away . Are you insane ? Hey , Spence , who are you ? You know who this is ? What I have , what I have , take him . Good . You 've come around . I 've been waiting on you . You 'll be thankful for those drugs . Spencer Olham was a genius . At 15 he 'd mastered differential and integral calculus . Harvard , M.I.T.m Ph. D. in biochemical engineering Cavendish Laboratory , top subatomic physicist and all by the age of 23 . Outstanding . No military record . Father John Olhamm , fighter pilot , distinguished service . Ship went down in historic Z-12 dogfight . MIA case until they found his body at a Centauri P.O.W. camp . He 'd been flayed alive . Young Spencer was eight years old . Spencer Olham was a driven man . I 'm not happy about losing him ... And when I 'm not happy , nobody 's happy . Wha ... Do you like jokes ? I have a joke for you . - Knock , knock . - Why are you doing this ? I 'll say it one more time . Knock ... knock . - Who 's there ? - Not Spencer Olham . Three days ago our Special Ops team intercepted a Centauri Intelligence courier . This was on its body . Centauri . Your native tongue . Sounds like a wild boar on the make . we muddled through it and decoded your plan to infiltrate our installations using humanoid robots . What , I 'm a scientist . You 're a scientist . You know , you things are really something . It 's not a mechanical robot at all ... but a genetic cyborg , evolved from synthetic DNA . It breathes , sweats , bleeds ... but right here , right now it seems to have no idea what it is . Now this will really excite you . A Centauri hit list . Humans targeted for murder and then replication . This morning we found your target Olham 's name - on that list . Wait a minute ... This is a mistake . Now , I-I-I ... I know you think you know what 's going on here but I can clear this up very quickly . - We have tests - - " We " ? - methods - you can run a spiral core PET scan ... - We who ? - or DNA amplification using a ... - Oh , I see you 've learned to patronize , as well . - Please , listen to me . DNA amplification ... - Your needle ship penetrated our outer dome . You murdered Spencer Olham when he was most vulnerable . Somewhere outside the city . - Somewhere unrestricted . - This is insane . - Where ? Where is your ship ? ! - Please , please listen to me . - I know you 're a tool for assassination . - You have no proof . Your meeting tonight with the Chancellor that 's when you would detonate . I am Spencer Olham , you crazy fuck ! Do you know when my dog pleases me most ? It 's when he displays human qualities . Sometimes he cocks his head , puzzled . You 're not the prototype . We found this Cyborg ... trying to pass himself off as an engineer at one of our Mars bases . I 'm telling you , my name is Jack Stoller ! I got a wife and two kids ! Please don 't do this ! I 'm begging you . Please don 't do this ! I am Jack Stoller ! You 're making a mistake ! My name is Jack Stoller ! My name is Jack Stoller ! Stop ! Please stop ! The Centauri U-bomb . Annoying , isn 't it ? If I could blow us all to hell , then what are you doing here ? You 're not close enough to your target . The U-bomb is programmed to coalesce at trigger phase . Right now , you 're just a useless curiosity . Nelson ... Jesus Christ , don 't let them do this . Please , tell them it 's me . You know it 's me ... Nelson ... Remember my ... my wedding ? You got piss-drunk . You hit on Maya and you begged her not to tell me . Well she told me , Nelson . I never brought it up ; I forgave you . And when Josh had an emergency appendectomy I sat with you all night and I asked you if you ever regretted having kids in this miserable war , and you said , No , because they made it all bearable . They made it all worth it . It 's me , Nelson . It 's me . Please help me . Memories ... senses , knowledge - you pilfered them all . But there was one thing you couldn 't take from Spencer Olham . Do you know what that is ? " When the solution is simple ... God answers " . I 'm quoting ... - " Einstein " - I know who said it , I want the answer . Can God give you an answer ? What was it that you could not steal Spencer dead body ? His soul . I forgave you , you son of a bitch . Gentlemen , let 's ge started . That 's right , let 's get started . Hathaway 's a bit on the slow side , isn 't he ? Oh , too bad , he 's a little dim ! Hey , I have a joke for you . Here 's my joke for the day : Knock , knock . Who 's there ? Hathaway . Hathaway ? Hathaway , the real target . You thought it was the Chancellor . Fatal Error . Trigger phase activated . Countdown , 30 seconds : Tick ... tock ... tick , tock . When the solution is simple , God is answering . Strap him in the Vivisec . That 's right , you drill me . You drill me real good . We 'll all go out In a blaze of glory . Long live the Centauri ! Target lock - Kaboom ! - Kaboom ! - He 's playing with you . He 's trained to do that . Strap in the robot . Watch your fingers . 10 , 9 , 8 ... Get back ! Put the gun down ! - Get back ! - Clear the room . Get back ! Attention , all ESA units . Enemy infiltration in progress . Enemy infiltration in progress . - I don 't see anything ! - Move ! Run around that corner ! - Double-check that quadrant ! - Yes , sir . - All clear at 19-6 ! . - Move back here ! Omega Six . Status . Omega Two-Niner-Six . Status . He 's on his way to the surface . Nelson ... Nelson . Hold on . You 're going to be all right . Listen . Listen to me . You 're not going to die . Veterans Hospital . How may I direct your call ? - Olham , Maya Olham . - I will transfer you . - Maya ... - Hi , this is Dr. Olham ... At Veterans Hospital . Please leave a message . If this is a medical emergency enter code 2112 . You 'll have 30 seconds after the symbol . Maya , Christ , I need to know ... - Spence ? - Maya , God , Are you all right ? What did they do to you ? Where are you ? - Tell me what they told you ? , The ESA . - They told me that you 've been arrested ... - For treason ... - They think I 'm someone else . - They said that you 're a spy . - Maya , please listen to me . - Why you ? - They want me dead ! Listen . There is a test in the hospital , It 's something they missed . I took it three years ago . - A test ? What does this have to do ... ? - If I can run another one ... comparative for proof ... to try ... - They will see ... It 's comprehensive . It 's undeniable . - You can 't come here . You 're not listening to them , are you ? It 's not safe . Spence , I need to know where you are . - Locking down A-sector now . - I 'll come to you . You 'll be thankful for those drugs . Move ! Go ! Go-go-go ! Get down ! So ... So the first question I have for you , Major , is this : - Why are we having this conversation ? - I take full responsibility . Effective immediately I 'll hand the matter over to Captain Burke . - He 's a good man . - Pick up your weapon Mayor . A good man is not what I need . - Is the replicant still pursuing its target ? - We don 't know . - What is the range of the bomb ? - We don 't know . - Is there a secondary trigger ? - We don 't know . Given that the Chancellor is landing in four hours , is there anything you do know ? We know it 's either in the evac tunnels or out in the Zone . I recommend you evacuate the city immediately . You recommend ... that I set off a mass panic and you can 't even show me an X ray ? Mr. Secretary ... the Centauri are well ahead of us in nanotechnology . The bomb , it eludes standard detection . The explosive parts coalesce at trigger phase . That 's when you 'd hear ... A big Boom ! Don ; t fuck with me , Major . - Now , tell me how we deactivate it . - We shoot it . We can 't shoot it , because you can 't contain it . It believes it is human . It wants to live . It knows fear . It will make a mistake . In the genius lies the defect . Lucky for us ... it bleeds . And how many innocent men bled for your mistakes before you uncovered the first replicant ? Ten . You don 't lose any sleep over those dead men do you , Hathaway ? We lost ten and saved 10,000 . I sleep like a baby , Mr. Secretary . 533rd Street and Tyler Avenue . Old Grid . Census Bureau reports CimCode hit on Spencer John Olham . You shouldn 't be here . I said you shouldn 't be here . Attention , all inhabitants . You have 30 seconds to comply . This man is a prison escapee . Take a good look at him . Have you seen him ? - Burke , give me an update ! - Zero read , sir- - either the masonry 's too thick or they still have lead paint up there . All right , bring it out . All right , let 's go . Move it out ! Switch it on . Sir , we are draining 25 % of dome power . Ready yourself , gentlemen ! One floor at a time , Sergeant . Burke , we are up , and now scanning the building . I make four holdouts ground floor , and a fifth on the second . Second floor . Command , this is Alpha T. We 've got the holdout on the second floor . I 've got another one . Third floor . Looks like a runner heading upstairs . 78 % probability by body mass . That 's fourth floor , Burke . Identify runner on the fourth floor . 5th floor . Target is not moving . - There must be old motors up there . - Goddamn it , Sergeant , give me a fix . Getting magnetic interference , sir It 's topped out . Go slow , Burke . Your target is now on the roof ! Sir , I am picking up ... - Got him ! Got him ! - Target-lock : Eight meters Go , go , go , go . Whoa . Identify your target , Burke . Target appears to be a little girl , sir . We 're bringing her down . Next building , gentlemen . - He 's too fucking hot . We shouldn 't have brought him here . - What are you talking about ? The hotter he is , the bigger the bank , you know that . He 's wanted by the ESA . Just let me see if I can trade something for him , okay ? Spencer , John Olham . Married . No wants or warrants . No history of infectious disease . Work record classified . Now that jacket and this full-auto Glock 18 say ESA . But everything else about you smells like a shit backed-up civilian waiting on a heart attack . Which are you ? Look , those troopers will be back and they may not miss this place next time . - If you 're smart , you 'll just let me go . - Get up . Get up ! So where would it go if it was thinking like Spencer Olham ? - Sir ... - Next quadrant . Yes sir . This way , come on . This way . This way . BORDER INTERDOMO - Border Patrol . - That 's right . They pay good cash for runners like you . - You 're going to turn me in to the ESA . - Life 's a tragedy . Move . - whatever you can get , I 'll triple it . - It 's too late . House allocation , food rations ... - I can get you all of it . Come on , help me out . - Too late ! See that dome right there ? A government program built that after ... We were bombed by the Centauri . After we got turned into the Dead Zone . See , that 's how you G-fucks always deliver - too goddamn late .. Now , get up . Walk . Walk ! - Walk ! - I 'm not going back to them . I won 't die like that . You can kill me , but I 'm worth a lot more to you alive . - You 're useless to me . - Drugs . Narcoanfetaminas , adrenoesteroides . Pharmaceuticals ... - What ? - Jump , delirium ... - Anything you want . - So , what you think ? You think you know me ? All Zoners are junkies . Right ? Right ? - No , that 's not what I meant . Not you . - You know , I don 't like you . You keep saying all the wrong things . Then listen to the words . I 'm not saying " junkie , " I 'm saying " payoff . " I 'm offering you a real trade . Punch in this CimCode : 746-218 . Come on . Just do it . Do it ! Maya June Olham . Pretty girl . 35 . No wants or warrants . - Associate Director ... - Associate Director , of Veterans Hospital , Central City Sector . She 's my connection . And she 'll do anything ... to get her husband back alive . Now , I know ... that you can run me into that city underground and I can ... get you inside that hospital supply . In and out , clean . So , what 's it going to be ? VETERANS HOSPITAL Dr. Olham ... I 'd like to convey my ... my deepest regrets . I had ... great respect for you husband ... his work . We all mourn with you . - I 'm Major Hathaway . - Yes , I know who you are . We haven 't found , your husband 's body yet But ... every effort is being made to locate his murderer this " Impostor " ... Don 't you think I 'd know my own husband , Major ? I think we 'd all like to believe that this never happened . And when did it happen ? This " switch " ? - While we slept ? While he showered ? When ? - We don 't know when . Oh , so , you don 't know for certain then , do you ? We know that the replicant poses a real threat to the public , Dr. Olham . And since it believes it is your husband it will likely contact you , turn to you for assistance , or may have already . - Do you have a wife , Major ? - Pardon ? - Do you have a wife ? - Yes . - Does she know you very well ? - She knows I 'm a human , if that 's what you mean . And how does she know that ? Because I 'm not on a Centauri hit list and I 'm not walking around with a bomb in my ribcage . And for every second that we debate known facts , we are closer to mass murder So , I need to ask you a couple of simple questions . Has it contacted you ? - No . - Do you have any idea where it might go ? None . I 'm sure if something occurs to you , you 'll let Lieutenant Burrows know immediately . My men will be escorting you home ... to grieve . I have six wards running at twice capacity , Major . I 'll grieve when my shift is over . Nelson Gittes is dead . Murdered by the replicant along with two of my men . Oh , I 'm sorry for them too . Take off your jacket . There is a big difference between you and me ... And I 'm not talking about the obvious . See , me , I ghost in and ghost out of the city. you ... You , the ESA will pick you off at the first census post . - You 're going to strip my CimCode ? - Like I said , take it off . He 's going to need a knockout . I don 't have that much . Whatever you got , keep it topical . Already got enough shit in me to embalm a horse . - Government-issue Mercury Pentothal , my guess . - Hmm , powerful drug . Give you bad dreams . Yeah , I 've noticed . - You got anything to flush it with ? - Adrenozine , maybe , but if we had that this would be a real hospital , and ... Uh , I 'd be a real doctor . Watch his spinal cord . - You sure you don 't want to be out for this ? - Oh , shit . This hurts . Well , now nobody 's going to know you when you 're visiting . Hey , put this on . And get rid of that G-coat . No , I 'll , uh ... I 'll hold on to it . Could be useful . Don 't worry about the CimCode . - She 'll shred it . Now let 's go . - I 'd like to keep it . Souvenir . TUNEL BLUE LINE - 22 : 00 hours . Hey . Wait here . Wait right here . I think you 've got some things you forgot to share with me ... - Spencer ... - What did they tell you ? Because if we don 't have honesty in our relationship we have a dead relationship . - I 'm not what they say I am . - Then what are you ? - Just tell me what they said . - No , I want you to tell me . I want to hear it from you ... you tell me . They told you ... that they couldn 't surface because it 's too hot up there . There 's too many military looking for someone - With my face ... and my name . - What else ? Doesn 't this seem a little off ? Your friends ... know I 'm public enemy number one , that I 'm worth something and then they just walk away . Does it seem like your friends ? How about a trade , Cale ? Let 's talk trade . Safety . Where 'd you learn to fight like that ? What 's your name ? Cale . Is there anything else you want to know ? - No . - Well , being that we 've become so goddamn friendly why don 't you tell me what I want to know ? All right , Cale .

If you had this kind of tenacity you 'd be a general by now . I need a status report . There 's 80,000 square feet down there , Major . We 're still searching . Of course they are . As reported earlier the Chancellor was scheduled to return to the city for a function at the Defense Bureau earlier tonight but that event was canceled without explanation and the Chancellor 's precise whereabouts are unclear . That blaze in Sutton Wood seems to be finally coming under control . Fire-fighting robots are said to have 90 % containment as of this hour . Investigators are still unable to declare an official cause of the fire . but they say they are taking seriously eyewitness reports about an electrical anomaly in the Sutton Dome just a few hours ... They went camping this weekend up in Sutton Wood . Dome Authority has already ruled out a lightning strike ... Lucky you missed the fire as the cause of that anomaly . Maya ... Are they still there ? Are they right outside ? Maya , listen to me . - If it 's safe , then meet me ... - Don 't say any more . - You 've got to trust me . - Spence ! Please . If you still believe in me ... all I ask is that you ... you meet me . Meet me where we first met . That 's all I ask . Spence ? ! Spence ? ! Keep walking . Where are you ? Maya . - Oh , God . - Did they follow you ? No . I know you 're afraid . I know what they told you . That some ship got through the dome and landed somewhere outside the city . - They were right in theory but they made one crucial error ... - I don 't understand . The ship crashed . You see , that 's what - that 's what caused the fire . They miscalculated . The Centauri never got to me ! I know the ship is here . I can find it . I 'll show you . Do you believe them ? You 're bleeding . - Do you believe them ? - I don 't know what to believe . They were in the house for hours . They said you killed Nelson . They searched the house . - They-they ... they went through our clothes ... - Did they hurt you ? - No . - They kept grilling me ... Asking me for proof of God . All I could think of was you .

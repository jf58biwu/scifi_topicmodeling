 Six days ago , this was the most amazing garden I 've ever seen . Look at it now . Well , we should have been paying closer attention . What kind of insects do this in a week ! Well , that 's a question for Challenger ... or Veronica , if she were here . After all , it is her garden . So what are WE going to do about it ? Slash , burn , replant , what else can we do ? Veronica must have some way to deal with insect problems . I 'm sure she does , but did any of us ever show any interest ... in her gardening techniques ? Like you said , she 's the gardener . We can 't all do everything . But food is everyone 's responsibility . Oh , yes I know that . Roxton hunts , Veronica gardens , I do more than my fair share of the cooking . Still haven 't worked out what you do yet . Well , what does Challenger do besides work in his lab all day ? Challenger does more work than any of us , Finn . For one thing , he designed the electric fence that keeps the animals out . So maybe he should design one that keeps the insects out too . Yes . At the moment , he 's working on a substitute . A substitute for what ? Food . That 's crazy ! I mean , even in the twenty-first ... century no one has figured that out ! Ah , but that won 't deter George Challenger . When he saw what happened to this garden the other ... day , that was the first thing that popped into his head . Anything to get out of real work . Speaking of which , fresh ... crops won 't plant themselves . Shall we ? Healthy weight gain , without your normal food . Increased energy , and no obvious side effects . If my beverage can nourish us in the same way , I can change the course of civilization . No longer will our supply be at the mercy of the elements , or in danger of being devoured by ... insects or rodents . No offence . If I were back in civilisation now , the discoveries I have made here would ... revolutionize the world . Ah , well . One day my friends , one day . This farming thing is kinda neat . Planting things and watching them grow ... Perhaps this can be your contribution to the household . Until Veronica returns , someone needs to assume responsibility . That 's not so hard . Ah , look at that . A little watering , a little weeding , and plenty of tender love and care . Nothing to it really . What about the insects ? Maybe your crossbow will come in handy . Yeah right ! Farmer Finn . That 's me . Farmer Finn ! I do like that ! The final test ... the human trial . Ugh ! Obviously an acquired taste . Not unlike my good wife 's cooking . So . Here 's to domestic science . Seems to be working . My metabolism is increasing ... oh , good heavens ... Who 's there ? Who 's ... At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World That was quite a jolt . Good gracious ! That 's over an hour ! Obviously too much of something ... Strange it didn 't affect you ... Oh , well . It 's never as easy as you thought it would be , is it , George ? How can you read this ? - Scurf or scarf . I can 't ... - Scurf pea . Psoralea corylifolia as it 's known in Latin . Very effective at killing bacteria . Do we really need all these plants ? Mugwort , red sage , dogwood , pagoda tree , kudzy vine ? Kudzu vine ! Very effective against the common cold . Milk vetch , burdock , barrenwort ... this list goes on and on ! Our medicine chest is very low , Marguerite . We have to keep up our vitamin supply as well ... if we are to remain healthy , especially in light of ... that insect assault on the garden . Not to mention my dismal failure in the laboratory . Replacement for food is a tall order , George , even for you . Don 't be so hard on yourself . Finn seems ready to take over the gardening duties . And there 's still plenty of game in the jungle . We won 't starve . I realize that . But a food substitute ! Now that really would be an accomplishment , wouldn 't it ? Imagine what the world would be like ... if starvation could be eliminated completely ! Yes , it would be very crowded ! Oh , Marguerite . Over half the world 's population suffers from malnutrition . A food substitute ... now that would be the greatest discovery of the century , wouldn 't it ? I 'll not give up on this . It 's too bad , I was hoping you 'd join us on this ... little weed-hunting expedition to identify the plants ! Oh you don 't need me . There are sketches of all the plants on that list in this book . I beg your pardon ! Was that your stomach ! ? I haven 't eaten in two days . - Why ever not ? - Well , it would be very difficult to gauge the ... effectiveness of my formula on a full stomach now , wouldn 't it ? Isn 't that what mice are for ? That 's a very good point . My initial recipe had a very ... positive effect on them but virtually no effect on me ... except to render me unconscious for an hour or so . Oh , don 't worry . I think I found the cause of that . It won 't happen again . George , I think you should abandon this experiment ... right now , before you kill yourself ! Yes . I tend to agree . You are far more important than a ... a substitute for food ! I will not be deterred by a small failure . I intend to see this one out . How 's it going ? Not as well as I would like . But that 's all part of the scientific process , I 'm afraid . What are you doing ? I 'm taking blood samples to help me analyze ... the effects of this beverage I 'm developing . First I count the blood cells , red versus white . If there 's an excess number of white cells ... - That means you 're sick . - Precisely . White blood cells are the body 's defense ... against illness and disease . A higher red blood cell count means you 're healthy . Lots of oxygen circulating through the blood . How DO you know so much about blood ? Radiation poisoning was very common in the XXI century . After Zoth and his goons destroyed the world , the atmosphere was contaminated for years . Radiation probably killed more people than the bombs . - How horrible . - Tell me about it . I also have to test blood sugar ... for the nutritional level of the formula . It 's not good at all . See ? The blood sugar is very low . Why do all this work if there 's so much food around ? Well , that may not always be the case , as well you know . The role of the scientist is to provide solutions ... for what one day may well be very serious problems . 84.2 kilos , I 'm losing weight as well . The scientific method may appear to be rather slow , but ... it really is quite fascinating ! Observation , experimentation , testing , and then recording all the data . Sounds about as much fun as learning to read . It does take a little effort . But if you understood the principles ... I 'm sure you would quite enjoy it ! I think I 'd rather be a farmer . Of course . I understand . This doesn 't look like dogwood to me . More like mugwort , I would say . - What do you think ? - You are kidding me . Yes , definitely mugwort . All right , what 's next on the list ? - A cold drink and a hot bath ! - Sounds like a good idea , but ... we can 't go back to the tree house with just one plant . Oh look ! It says here that mugwort is a pain reliever ... which is just about what I need right now . Ah yes , here it is . Right there . I just saw a weed like that . And I thought you weren 't paying attention ! Here it is ! Oh , no , no , no ! Oh , Marguerite , that 's poison ivy ! It 's not poison ivy . I know what that looks like . Just pick it , will you ? I 'm not touching it . If you think that 's ... kudzu vine , you pick it yourself ! Fine ! The sooner we get this done the better ! What 's next ? So , grow already ! A is for apple ... B is for boring . Challenger 's right . Reading can be useful . C is for crossbow ... - Something wrong ? - No . I told you it was poison ivy . No it 's poison ivy . No , it wasn 't ! Then why are you scratching yourself ? Damn Challenger and his lists ! If we weren 't out here collecting these weeds , this never would have happened ! Well , if you 'd listened to me in the first ... place , this never would have happened . Oh , what are you , a botanist now ? You can 't even tell a fig tree from an oak ! Maybe so . At least I wasn 't silly enough to pick up poison ivy . There must be something in this list for skin rashes . Burdock ! Here it is . That should be easy enough to find . Well , let 's hope it works . In the meantime , stop scratching . - Yeah . - You 'll only make it worse . So , 2 grams of potassium , plus 1.9 grams of fiber , 1.2 millilitres ... . of folic acid . Great thunder ! Well , you 'll be fed soon . All right . Some for you ... and the rest for me . Ugh . The appearance and odor have not improved . That is ... very filling . Heart rate 's increased . So has my metabolism . We will make believers of them yet ! - Yes we will ... - Ah . That 's more like the man I know . Who said that ? Who the blazes are you ? You ought to know , I 'm you ... George Edward Challenger . I don 't believe this ! You 're not me ! Oh but I am , I 'm you when you were young and focused , without distractions . A promising young scientist , fresh from his first doctorate , accepting the rightful congratulations of his peers . This is impossible ! I must be hallucinating . Are you ? Have not many strange and fascinating ... things happened to you in your lifetime ? And not without reason . It must be the effects of this beverage I 've been developing . Oh , nonsense ! You 're a man with a special destiny . I 've arrived to ensure you fulfill that destiny . Oh , be off with you ! Get away from me ! Have you forgotten the ambitions of your youth ? Your purpose is science , Professor , Challenger . Scientific glory is your destiny . Glory is for others to bestow . My purpose is to work . Since when ? Work without recognition means you 'll be forgotten . Be trampled by imitators . Tell me , George ... what have you actually accomplished here ? I have made significant progress in many areas . No you haven 't ! You 've lost your edge . Your talents have been wasted on gadgets ... for housewives and other useless distractions . How dare you speak to me like that ? How dare I ? I am you ! I am trying to help you . While you rot in this ignominious place , your rivals back in London ... are laughing at your demise ! You need to get back to civilization before it 's too late . If you think I 'm bathing with this , you 're crazy ! At least I 'm not itchy . Here . According to the list , burdock is an effective balm against skin irritation . Has Challenger ever steered us wrong ? You are really enjoying my discomfort , aren 't you ? Not at all , in fact , I find your itch quite irritating . - How is it ? - Delightful ! Keeping us apart , I see . Any gentleman would do the same ! Oh , ho ! You 're just afraid of catching it , that 's all ! Hardly ! As a matter of fact , I 'm one of the fortunate few ... who 's immune to poison ivy . - Really . - Yes . How about a little kiss ? The mood you 're in , I don 't know if that 's such a good idea . Oh , I 'm in the mood for a little romance . How about you ? - I hadn 't really thought about it . - Hmm , that 'll be a first . I think I should go and chop some firewood . - It could get cold tonight . - Yeah . Very cold . I promise you that ! Oh it 's not good . Not good at all . Blood sugar level is very low . I have to mix up some more . Don 't you see what 's holding you back ? Oh , get away from me . You are in my mind . You are just a figment of my imagination . - I 'm over here . - Leave that alone ! That 's better . Now ... where was I ? You can 't get rid of me that easily . What do you want ? I told you . I want to help you achieve your goals . Return and recognition , that is the path to glory . It won 't happen in as long as you let these so-called ... friends of yours hold you back . My friends have been immensely helpful to me . In fact , they have saved my life ... Oh , rubbish ! They treat you like a lab assistant ... whose sole purpose is to make their lives more comfortable . You don 't need them . All they do is steal your ideas and sap your energy ... and distract you from your purpose . - No ! - Oh , yes . You need to show the world what you can do . I will receive recognition one day . My work will not go unrewarded ! I won 't let them steal my ideas . I 'll do everything I have to , to stop them . - What do you want ? - Who were you talking to ? I wasn 't talking to anybody . Oh , I might have been talking to myself . Did it help ? Don 't you be flippant with me , young lady ! What are you doing , creeping down here to spy on me ! - Is that the game you 're playing ? - Spy on you ? Don 't you think I don 't know what your motives are ! You 're just like the rest of them ! You think my sole purpose is to invent gadgets for your comfort ! - You 're out of your mind ! - This is my laboratory ! It 's my life 's work ! It belongs to me ! - Get out of here ! - Fine . You can have it . I 'm outta here ! Oh , bravo ! Do you feel better now ? Return and recognition that 's what you need to focus on . You 're right ! You 're absolutely right ! Oh , whatever you 've made for dinner smells delicious . Yeah , well , don 't think I 'm sharing anything with you . What 's wrong ? You kicked me out of your stupid lab ! I did ? I 'm so sorry . I must have been preoccupied with my work . You do look terrible . Oh I feel exhausted . I really must get some sleep . Yeah , I think that 's a good idea . Jessie ? Hello , George . However did you get here ? I 'm your wife , George . You seem to have forgotten that . No ! This is impossible . Oh , you 've driven yourself into exhaustion again , as usual . No ... you 're not here ! You 're back in London ! Yes . And time is running out for us . You know how important my work is . How necessary it was for me to come here ! Your beloved science . Yes , I know . But I 've been waiting for over three years now , George . Three years without a word , not knowing whether you were ... you were alive or dead ! I 'm sorry , Jess , I couldn 't get word to you or anybody else . Believe me , I tried . What about the years before that , George ? Years lost waiting while you toiled in your lab , night after night ... My work is important . You know that . You lied to me , George . - No , never ! - I would be your wife , - you said . - And I meant it , You are . To whom am I married , George ? To the man , or to his work ? You know how I 've always felt about you . Always second to your science . - I 'll make it up to you ! - Oh , George . Don 't do it for me . Do it for us ... before there 's nothing left . Don 't say that . I 'll never , never leave you like this again . Never . What are you doing ? My chest is itchy . And I thought you didn 't want to get too close . I 'm sorry . I must have rolled downhill during the night ! Dammit ! Not allergic to poison ivy , huh ? Well , I never used to be . What about you ? You still feeling the effects ? No , I am fine . That burdock bath seems to have cleared it right up . Well good . I 'll try some myself . Sure you 're not itchy ? No ! Not a bit . In fact , I think we should collect those plants for Challenger ... that is , if you can keep your hands to yourself . I 'm sure that won 't be a problem . Jessie ! Oh , it must have been a dream . Some for you ... and the rest for me . To you very good health . That 's excellent ! Just what I needed . Oh , it 's working . I never looked better , if that 's possible . Finally you 're out of bed . I thought you were going to sleep all day . It 's barely 6 a.m. While you were dreaming about your wife , one of your ... trusted friends was snooping around your laboratory . Finn ! Who else ? Searching through your notes , looking for anything she could steal . But Finn can 't even read ! Oh ! What a fool you are , you taught her to read . She practices night and day , with only one thing on her mind ... to steal your ideas and make her own way out of here . No ! I can 't believe that of her . No ! She comes from a different world than you , George . A world destroyed by war . Her only quest in life is to help herself , to escape her dismal situation any way she can . Was she really down here in my laboratory ? Look around . It 's obvious that somebody 's been here . Well ... yes . If you don 't do something about it , she will steal your life 's work , and reap all the rewards for herself . - But what can I do ? - Kill her . George . No ! I can 't ! You know you can ... and you must . No ... there has to be another way . Kill her before she shoots you in the back ... with that nasty little crossbow of hers . Oh yes , that 's what she 's planning to do , once she 's ... made off with everything you have ! Why that ungrateful little vagabond ! That 's the way . Make an example of her for the others . There she is ! Don 't let her get away . Good bye , Finn . Do it now ! What are you doing ? You betrayed me , Finn ! - How did I do that ? - My work ! - You know it 's my life ! - I didn 't touch your work . You were snooping around my laboratory last night . You need to stop drinking your experiment . That 's close enough . There 's nothing the matter with me . You 're poisoning yourself and you don 't even know it . What ? That crud you 've been drinking ... I 've seen it happen before . You don 't know what you 're talking about ! Yes , I do . Now turn around , and go back to the treehouse . - Try and sleep it off . - I do not take orders from you . Then maybe you 'll listen to Roxton and Marguerite when they get back . - Traitors ! All of you ! - Go ! I 'll get you ! Every one of you ! That burdock didn 't help a bit . Scratch that one off Challenger 's list . No pun intended . Are you sure you still not itchy ? Nope , not a bit , although I am getting a little tired of ... walking around in circles . I 'm sure we covered this area ... - yesterday ... - I saw that ! All right ! My rash is worse than ever ! Why didn 't you tell me , you silly thing ! Because I was trying to pay you back for your cruel behavior . - Cruel ! - Yes ! Laughing at my misfortune ! Oh ! We can 't go on like this . Tell me about it . There is one thing we could try though . When I was a lad my brother pushed me into a poison ivy patch . Well , we found out that mud is the best thing for it . Mud ? No , I think I 'll pass on that . All right . You suit yourself . There 's got to be some mud around here somewhere . Well ... did it work ? Oh , why didn 't I pull the trigger ? How could I let her escape ? I need nourishment ... Look at you ! You 've lost your senses ! My friends have betrayed me . - What sort of nonsense is that ? - Finn ... was in here last night going through my notes . That young girl ? She loves you like a father , George . She would never do anything to hurt you . You don 't know her ! She threatened to kill me . In the state you 're in , I 'm not surprised . - Are you falling apart , George . - No ! It 's time now to think of your home , and your family . You don 't understand the pressure that I 'm under ... the importance of my work ! Oh , that 's right , Hide behind your science ... - even when it leads to your demise . - Demise ! Science is everything to me . And I will not be deterred , Jessie . Not even by you . You understood that when we married . When we were married , you were a different man ! No , he wasn 't . You tried to hold him back , to change him . But he was the stronger man . He left you in England where you belong ! You were the one he should have left behind . What did you ever do to help him ? Noooo ! No ! Both of you , be quiet ! I gave him purpose and direction , the desire to succeed ... all the ingredients necessary to become a great man . You gave him blind ambition ! You made him selfish and paranoid , demon-possessed ... in the pursuit of fame and glory ! Not a man at all ! This is disgusting ! Yep . But does it feel good ? Well , I 've lost the urge to scratch , but ... as far as the rash goes , it 's a little hard to tell . Well , we can assess that situation when we wash off down in the stream . We ? Oh no , Marguerite ! Please , not in here ! You have got a filthy mind ! I 'm going have a swim . And YOU are going to stay here until I have finished . Of course . Cover your eyes , Mud in your eyes if you don 't close them ! Oh , whatever was I thinking . John ! ? - What is it ? - Don 't look ! Someone 's taken our clothes ... ! I said don 't look ! Sorry ! You have to know the path of science is the only way Better than drinking poison , testing yourself like some lab rat . Better than giving up his work and becoming mediocre like everyone else . Better to be human ! To understand what it means to be alive ! A mere human ? All you want is for him to fail ! All I want is the love he once had for me ... He doesn 't love you . He never did ! All that ever mattered to him was science ! That isn 't true ! He 's capable of both ! No ! Just get out ! - Get out ! Get out ! - You 're killing him ! You 're the one who 's doing that . - What are you doing ? - I can 't take this any more . George , don 't , don 't , don 't please ! Leave me alone ! Get away from me ! Both of you ! They 're killing me ! They 're killing me ! - George , please let me help you ! - Don 't listen to her . Remember who you are , what you need to be . You are driving me out of my mind ! You can escape your destiny . - Don 't listen to him ! - Get away from me ! Just get away ! - Stay away ! - Uff . Roxton and Marguerite better get back here soon . Now what ? ! Come on , Marguerite ! Don 't use all the hot water ! This is glorious ! Yeah ! Glorious for you ! But I 'm still a mess . It was your idea to take a mud bath to begin with . You must admit it cured the poison ivy . I still can 't believe I let you talk me into it . I can 't believe you picked that plant when I told you not to ! This mud isn 't coming off very easily . Then maybe you 'd like me to get in there with you . - Don 't you dare ! - Ahem ! Finn ! - Don 't come any closer . - Don 't YOU come any closer . And this isn 't what it looks like ! - Someone stole all our clothes . - Yes . So you covered yourselves in mud . It was the only way we could stop the itch ! I don 't need to hear any more . I just thought ... you 'd might like to know that Challenger just ... ran off screaming through the jungle . Okay . I think he 's poisoning himself with the stuff he 's been drinking . He tried to kill me . When we were married you were just a man ... So hungry . That 's better ... much better ... - Much better - You are killing him . He 's weaving all over the damn place . You 're mad at me , aren 't you ? You think I should have tried to stop him . Oh , what could you do all by yourself ? - You think I 'm afraid of him ? - That 's not what I 'm saying , Finn . Well , you 're right . Okay , I should have done more to help him . - I hope he 's going to be okay . - Me too . I must have more ... Leave him alone . We 've got work to do ! We 're running out of time ! I won 't let you hurt him anymore . You don 't know what you 're talking about ! - Get up you old clod ! - Don 't you touch him ! - Look at him , he 's almost dead ! - Thanks to you ! You leave us alone ! You know I 'll give my life to save him first ! What kind of fiend are you ? The man you fell in love with . Oh , no . You only look like him . George , George ! You 're killing me ! He must be inside . Challenger ! George ? George . He 's dying . Finn 's right . If we don 't do something , he 's going to die . What can we do ? Did you find any of that concoction he was drinking ? No , just 101 ingredients . Dammit , Challenger ! What have you done to yourself , huh ? He needs a blood transfusion . It 's the only way to save him now . Blood transfusion ? They did that during the war , didn 't they ? Yes , but we don 't know Challenger 's blood type . What differences does it make ? I mean , if ... - it 's going to save him , let 's do it ! - No , John ! I saw a man die after being given the wrong type of blood . - We cannot risk it . - I can . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm type O-negative . It 's called the universal donor . It 's the one type that can be given to anyone without rejection . - How do you know so much about this ? - I 'm from the future , remember ? We got to know a lot of stuff you guys don 't . Then what are we waiting for , what do we need ? I know , Challenger will have it in his lab . - What is it ? - He tried to kill me , Roxton . What if we save him but his mind is gone ? Let 's get on with it . First you gotta let him bleed a little . - Now what ? - Now we have to unclamp this tube ... and let my blood flow into him . Then we can use the clamps to control the blood flow . It 'll stop the pressure from building in him . Come on , Challenger you have to pull through this . With my blood , he 'll be as good as new . His pulse is getting stronger . I 'll always love you , George . - Come back to me . - I will , Jess , I promise . Who 's he talking to ? His wife ! Her name is Jessie . She ... She was here . Welcome back to reality , George . You gave us quite a scare . Me too . You know , I think I put too much potassium in that formula . Did you really see your wife ? I certainly thought I did , I do believe she 's still waiting for me back in London . Do you think she 'll wait forever ? Oh , that 's too much to ask of anybody . But I know how very important she is to me . And how much I want to get home to her one day . Do you think you ever would ? I 'm eager to learn more ... about your life on the plateau in the twenty-first century , Between now and then , someone obviously found a passage to the outside world . - Don 't ask me where it is . - We 'll find it together , I hope . All of us . Are you ready for a little plant classification , George ? Before we all ... rush off into another day 's toil , I think we deserve ... a small break from our labours , don 't you ? Are you sure you 're feeling okay , George ? I feel marvelous , I assure you . You don 't have some important scientific experiment to finish ? - No invention to invent ? - Well , yes . But they can wait . So you 're saying you want to take some time off . Yes . That doesn 't sound so horrible , does it ? Spend some time with friends ... Oh , yes , he FEELS perfectly normal . How perfectly abnormal ! *

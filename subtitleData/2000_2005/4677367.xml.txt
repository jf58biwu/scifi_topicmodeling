 Lightfoot : This is Black Ice , on team syncing at Level Five security . Base : Roger that , we 're locked . Base : Your next contact is at 0430 at Melbourne Station - then you 're home . - Lightfoot : Roger that . Going full stealth . Mean and extreme . Base : Mean and extreme , Captain . ( beeping ) Lightfoot : I have a bogie at heading 176 , in pursuit . ( rapid beeping ) ( metallic clanking ) ( groans ) ( groan ) ( shrieking ) ( gunshots ) ( sizzling ) ( screams ) Woman : ... Dr. Leon ? Doctor : Can I help you with something ? Woman : Yeah , what 's wrong with that man ? May I ask who you are ? I 'm Loren Mercer . I 'm here to meet Dr. Leon from World Health . I 'm Samuel Leon . My associate , Susana Gabriel . The man is suffering from necrotic paralysis . Thus far , we have been unable to treat it . Man : Doctor , sorry , I 'm late . You must be Mercer ? Lev Valentine , nice to finally meet you . So you need a pilot to fly you somewhere in the Celebes ? That 's right . Some of that area is disputed territory , I 've led expeditions in the South Pacific . I 'm concerned about the landing . There 's a runway from World War II . No plane has landed there for years . It 's out of the way . So how 'd the sick man get out ? By boat . Think you can make a beach landing if the strip 's no good ? I do it all the time , but if you 're worried ... Worried ? No , not at all . What sort of expedition is this exactly ? Medical . The native was brought in by a missionary . He told us that Toe Boy 's people are dying . - Toe Boy ? - He 'll be our guide . And along with the medical mission , we 'd also like to identify and isolate the vector as soon as we can to determine the threat it presents . In English ? Find out exactly what bit him , dear . Bit him ? Bit him . A spider , we think . Toe Boy 's not being clear about it . Second thoughts ? No . Get your gear to the airport , we 'll take off tomorrow at 8 : 00 . Dr. Leon : Excellent . ( plane engine hums ) ( humming stops ) Mercer : Hey , are you looking for something ? Man : I found this magnificent specimen of Nephila Edulis ... That could be poisonous . Put that down ! All spiders have venom . Arachnids eat by injecting their prey with either a necrotic factor , a neurotoxin , or both . When the prey is paralyzed they cover it with digestive enzymes and suck a syrupy biomass into their stomachs . That 's more than I needed to know . Now , put it down . My book on arachnids . Oh , Henri Capri . You can keep it . I hate spiders . Everyone does . My theory is that we recognize them as perfect predators and fear them . She 's harmless . You really like them , don 't you ? - I understand them . - I just step on them . They want the same things we do ... food , shelter , and a mate to propagate the species . - Leon : Hi , Mercer . - Good morning , Doctor . - I see you 've met Dr. Capri . - Oh yes . He 's our entomologist . - Capri : Look what I found . - No more spiders ! That spider is not coming . - It won 't bother anybody . - Please , Capri , no . Capri : How 's your patient , Dr. Leon ? He died this morning of massive pulmonary edema . Literally drowned in his own plasma . - Doctor . - Thanks . I had tissue samples forwarded to the CDC ... Good morning , everyone . Doctors , Mercer . Hi . I 'd like you to meet my adjunct , Bear , and Pablo Reyes . - Nice to meet you . - Where 's our ... That 's the one over there . Okay , Bear , load it up . ( Bear whistles ) Tell me , if you 're not worried about anything , then why are we carrying enough firepower to overthrow a small country ? Simple equation . The more guns I have , the safer I feel . Insects are notorious for carrying viruses and microbes . However , I doubt very much that spiders are capable ... to carry or transmit a virus . Capri : My thinking is that first of all ... Plane 's in good shape . Huh ? Valentine : I said the plane is in good shape . I learned on an old Piper . My dad flew a crop duster out of Fresno . So you flew in the Marines , huh ? How did you know I was Corps ? You and Bear are cut that way . " Semper fi , me and mine , Marines until the day we die . " Hooray ! So how come didn 't pilot them in yourself ? You knew the South Pacific . I figured you 'd bring us back . That 's odd , considering we 've never met , and I 'm fairly new to this area . A fighter pilot the Navy was fast-tracking until you abruptly resigned your commission . Now you fly charters . I did a background check . Why 'd you resign ? Let 's just say I 'm looking for something . Yeah ? Aren 't we all ? ( Valentine giggles ) Look , I 'm not interested in companionship , relationship or even a hump buddy . - Let 's keep it professional . - What ? Sorry to be blunt . Just want to be clear . Mercer , get over yourself . Yeah . Like you weren 't bird-dogging around , jarhead . Two girls are sitting there , butt-fucking-naked ... Really ? Mercer : Guys , this is our island . I 'm going to circle and try to find the landing strip . ( plane engine sputters ) Shit ! - What happened to the power ? - I lost it . - Restart the plane . - I can 't . Everyone strap in and hold on . Go manual on the hydraulics . Manual ? Okay , pump up flaps 10 % and increase by 10 % every five seconds and call it out . Buckle up , everybody , we 're in for a rough ride . - Valentine : Flaps at 10 % . - Hang on , we 're gliding in . - Valentine : Flaps at 20 % . - You know any prayers ? Flaps at 30 % . Flaps at 40 % . Full flaps ! Whoa , whoa ... whoa ! ( crashing ) Nice flying , Mercer . Nice praying . Bear : This is Alpha 6 , come in , please . I repeat , I repeat , come in , please . This is Alpha 6 . This is Alpha 6 , over . - Bear : I repeat ... - Okay . Well , how 's it looking , Mercer ? There 's absolutely nothing wrong with the engine . Then what caused the power failure ? No idea , but no one is going anywhere soon . That 's quite obvious . Bear 's been trying the radio system . The satellite phone 's not working . There seems to be some sort of natural magnetic interference . I just thank God we 're not dead . God wasn 't flying the plane , Susie , I was . This entire expedition is in serious jeopardy because of you , Miss Mercer . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd at least show some respect to my colleague . Okay . As soon as we finish here we want to have a strategy meeting . See what we can salvage from this disaster . Okay . Capri ? Reyes , you seen Capri ? - I haven 't , sir . - Would you look for him ? Reyes : Okay . You better put on some Deet . Mosquito-borne encephalitis is serious business out here . - Oh yeah ? - Yeah . I 'm mega dosing vitamin B. It keeps insects away naturally . I don 't do artificial anything , Güerita . Dios mío . ( whirring ) ( sizzling ) Dr. Capri ? ( rustling ) ¡ Puta Madre ! Capri : Stop ! Stop ! - Stop ! - Valentine : What 's going on ? We 're okay ! Coming back in . Doc , what the hell was that thing ? Now we won 't know , will we ? Come on , Doc , come on . I am not a little child . Sorry , Doc . Big meeting , you 're invited . - I have to collect my equipment . - Go . - Go . - Be careful . Come on ! Valentine : Okay , here 's my recommendation . We sit tight and try to establish radio contact . Mercer 's checked the plane . She thinks the engines are functional and with any luck we can probably attempt a beach take-off . I 'm afraid we haven 't had much luck with the plane or with Miss Mercer so far . Yeah ? If I don 't get this plane out of here then ... No , excuse me . We are here to give medical aid to these people , and learn what 's killing them . That 's exactly what we 're going to do . After we reach Toe Boy 's village we can discuss how best to proceed . I don 't think that 's a good idea . Mr. Valentine , I believe I 'm still in charge of this mission . I 'd rather take my chances in the forest . Every piece of electrical equipment we had went out , including the plane . I was in the cockpit . She 's the only reason that you 're alive . We break camp in the morning , first light . Bear , take the first watch . Reyes , you spot him in four hours . Yes sir . That 's liquid nitrogen , Mr. Reyes . If you accidentally drink it it will freeze your esophagus . Then the gas will expand inside you , and you will blow up like a balloon and explode . ( laughter ) Mercer : Hey , hey , hey . Where did you get this ? Do you understand me ? Where did you get this ? ( Toe Boy speaking native language ) Here on the island ? ( speaking native language ) - Valentine : Mercer . - What ? I want you to reconsider . - You should stay ... - Give me a brake . I 'm not a baby . Okay . Good . Then I 'll see you tomorrow . Good night . Bear : This is Alpha 6 . Come in , please . - Over . I repeat , this is Alpha 6 . - Any luck , Bear ? No , sir . Mercer , I wouldn 't take what Leon says too seriously . He 's under a lot of stress . What 's Susie 's story anyway ? Valentine : She was one of his graduate students . Became his assistant . Wonder what she did to earn her Masters ? Actually , Miss Mercer ... I spent three years in the Brazilian rain-forest classifying level III viral agents . I was five months in Kikwit , Zaire , tracking the source of the Ebola virus . That is where I met Samuel . I can survive with just a knife , shoot anything you put in my hands , and I have a brown belt in tae kwon do . Impressive . I just fly planes . Apparently not well . Anything else ? Yeah . I make a great dehydrated stew , and I can suggest something for those unsightly blackheads around your nose . Quite a resume . ( laughs ) Okay , let 's roll . Get your gear , let 's go . Uhh ... ! ¡ Chingado ! Stay away from there . Puta madre . ¿ Qué chingado es esto ? Aggh ! Leon : Oye , Reyes , ¿ qué pasó ? - Este chingado brazo . - Déjame ver . Wait ! These are ticks . If you don 't remove them correctly , their venom will remain under the skin - and release neurotoxins . - Fuck that ! Get them off now ! You should have used the insect spray , sir . - ( Reyes yells ) - Leon : Oh my God , look at that ! Yes , extraordinarily large . Actually , this could be a new species . If you don 't shut up , I 'll kill you . Okay ? Okay , cabrón ? Whoa ! Put the gun down . Easy , buddy . Easy . Breathe . Put it down ! Look at me , God damn it ! Come on now , put the gun down . Bear : That 's it , - Bear 's got you . - ( Reyes groans ) I 'll get them out . Come on ! Susana , be careful . We need to preserve a sample of those ticks . ¡ Vaya mierda ! - How you feeling , Doctor ? - I 'm fine , it 's just the heat . Okay , everybody , let 's take a break here . Take your packs off and take a rest . Mercer ? Bear , do a reckon , five by five . Yes , sir . Susana , be careful with the water . I need to wash him off . Try to use as little as possible . Mercer ? Mercer , are you okay ? Mercer ? Er ... Mercer , there 's ticks out here . Be careful . Look , I appreciate the heads up , but I 've been in the jungle before . I can take care of myself ... Shit ! Mercer ! You okay ? Yeah . Just stuck . Huh . It 's not funny . No , it 's not . Let 's get you out of there . Come on , you 're stuck . Aggh . Oh God , look at this . What ? It 's all over the inside of that hole . I think there 's something in here . Well , don 't piss it off . Aggh ! Something 's got my foot . - Valentine : Hang on . - Get me out of here . Get me the fuck out of here , now ! - Bear ! - Get me out of here ! Get me the fuck out of here ! Shit ! Whew . You okay ? Been better . Stuck . - Oh , shit . - We 're stuck . ( soft chuckle ) Okay . All right . Ahem ... Okay . Looks like spider silk . - Your boot 's still down there . - Yeah , I know . - Just leave it . - You can 't walk with one boot . ( grunts ) ( hisses ) Look at this . What could have done that ? ( Reyes screams ) What 's going on ? What the hell happened ? ! Susana : Help me ! ( screaming ) ( Reyes pants and screams ) Help me , I need to sedate him ! Easy partner , easy . Easy , easy . What 's happening with him ? Shh ! Quieto , quieto . Susana , what happened ? We were trying to get the ticks out . As soon as we touched them they buried deeper . That 's impossible . Ticks don 't move like that . Okay , all right , this man 's in a lot of trouble . Let 's remove these ticks . Is he going to be okay ? A field surgery would carry a high risk of sepsis . And if we try again to remove them forcibly , they could conceivably damage something internally . Will they harm him if we leave them in ? The ixodides should simply disengage once they 're gorged with blood . How are they gonna disengage ? They 're under his skin , for God 's sake . I don 't know . Come on , Capri . You are the arachnologist . Stiffen up , coño ! I ... I don 't know . I 've never seen or heard of anything of the kind . I don 't know . Doctor ... Your bedside manner basically sucks , Doctor . Can 't you see the man is upset ? ( Leon groans ) - ( Reyes groans ) - Shh . He 's going to be all right . Let 's all get some Deet on . Bear , let 's get him up . Where the hell did Capri go now ? That man 's becoming a liability . I 'll get him . Are you okay ? Sometimes I don 't know all the answers . None of us do , Henri , all the time . They look like ticks . Something 's not quite right here . Yeah , I know . I 've been reading about ticks in your book . These days I never go anywhere without it . Come on , I need to spray you . Cover your face . I remember the first time I soloed in an F-14 Tomcat . I was so scared , I almost planted it nose first into the deck . They wanted to ground me . I 'm still flying . We need you to take a look at something . Capri : Um-hmm . Mercer : So what 's the verdict ? Do you think it 's spider webbing ? It would seem so . Ridiculous . The hole is much too large . Agreed . A spider that large couldn 't exist . Its internal organs would crush under the force of gravity . Maybe there 's a simpler explanation . Such as ? The Japanese occupied the islands , dug tunnels everywhere . Maybe this is one of those tunnels that some spiders covered in silk . That 's certainly a plausible theory . So what grabbed my boot ? ( native language ) What is this , Capri ? These are normally found in caves . I mean , it is an aganpofinus , but it appears to be a mutation . Mutated how ? Valentine : Dr. Leon better come this way . Where are they ? Maybe they 're headed for the coast . It smells like death here . ( in native language ) ( thump ) ( flapping ) What the hell do they put on those darts ? Damn . Normally that would be spider venom . What kind of spider ? Most likely they use the venom from a widow . The neurotoxin can stop a bird 's heart in seconds . Its even deadly to other spiders . Now where was I ? Absolutely amazing . Have a look , Doctor . Ahh ! This specimen has no caeca . I can 't imagine how it digests its prey . Leon : What is this structure ? It looks skeletal . Capri : And that should also be impossible . Nothing with an external skeleton has an internal one as well . Nature would never be so blatantly redundant . Such a peculiar mutation has never been on record . ( Reyes coughs ) Susana , can 't you do something about that man ? Yes , Doctor . Is the sick man bothering you , Doctor ? You bother me . I 'm tired of your attitude and insults . As you can see there 's no one here . This mission is over . Why don 't you go fix your plane so we can get the hell out of here ? I 'll talk to you later . Mercer . Hey Mercer ! I 'm fine . I 'm going ... - to do a little ... - Take it easy , will ya ? What are you looking for out there ? Huh ? I know . I know it 's not a relationship or a hump buddy . Just stay here , please . Right here . Wait . I 'm sorry I was a bitch on the plane . Huh ? Look ... I found this on one of the natives . Yeah , they 've all got this . It looks like parachute silk . Yeah , well ... I think it belonged to my brother . Your brother , what ... ? ( retching ) - It 's okay . Breathe . - ( Reyes coughs ) It 's okay . ( Reyes vomits ) Ahh ! ( grunts ) No , please don 't shoot it . ( coughing ) Samuel , do something ! - ( grunting ) - ( Rattling ) ( rattling ) ( grunting ) ( crackling ) ( heavy breathing ) ( Reyes screams ) ( hissing ) ( footsteps ) Shit ! ( in native language ) We 're coming in . Shit ! Mercer , what is it ? There 's something in the jungle . What did I tell you about going in the jungle ? It 's big ... ( scream ) ( in native language ) Go to the camp ! Everybody by the fire . Mercer stay here ! ( scream ) ( growling ) ( squealing ) ( growling ) - ( thud ) - ( Loud squeal ) ( rustling ) ( slithering ) ( rustling ) ( slithering ) ( rattling ) ( squeal ) ( animal whistling ) Is everyone all right ? - Susana : Yes . - Mercer ? Mercer ? My brother Joli was a Navy Pilot . The plane he was testing , a stealth craft , disappeared 10 months ago . The Navy stopped looking after two months . I didn 't . They never came to a real conclusion about what happened . Some bullshit about ... pilot error , presumed dead . Too good a pilot . Too good a man . ( Toe Boy , in native language ) ( in native language ) My God ! What did this ? ( in native language ) Capri : Apart from the extraordinary size , this is inter-species mutation . Like the small spider ? Yeah , but far more biologically advanced . These creature seem to be evolving at lightning speed towards becoming the ultimate predators . I thought that was us . If spiders were as big as cats the human race would be finished . Dr. Leon , we 've got to take it back with us . We 've got to get ourselves back first . You were hired to take us in and bring us out , with the specimens . Do you have a problem ? I got one man dead , I got another man dying . Your expedition 's over , Doctor . We head back at first light , with specimens , if there 's anyone left to carry them . I 'm sorry , sir , I can 't possibly go . I 'm going to send Bear up into those hills tomorrow to try to send a signal back to Guam . The rest of us are heading to the beach . Doctor , please . You can 't stay here alone . We 're going to wait for help or until that plane is airworthy . - Valentine , I 'm staying . - Can 't let you do that . I 'm not leaving without my brother . - You can come back for him . - No . You were hired as our pilot . Do yourjob . We 'll meet you back at the plane tomorrow . Yes sir . Bear ... be careful , huh ? You bet your ass . Mercer . Mercer , I 'll help you find your brother . You 're right . He 's here somewhere . Just help me get these people out of here and I 'll come back with you . - Okay . - Leon : Where cojones is Capri ? Damn . ( soft buzzing ) I swear , when I find that gilipollas entomologist ... ? When I get home I 'm going to see my baby ? ? It 's been long , she 's feeling kind of shady ? ? But I love her , oh I love her ? ? Yes I do , yes I do . ? - ( laughing ) - ( Rustling ) Yeah . That 's how we do it back home , baby . - ( whoosh ) - ( Screams ) Ahh ! Get behind me ! ( rustling ) Ahh ! Don 't worry about Bear , he can take care . Let 's keep moving . Let 's go . Let 's go . Oh , fuck ! ( Capri groans ) This is it . Dying ecosystem . A mutant ... a mutant , prominent , arachnoid and reptilian features . A predator of enormous potential , and correctly adapted for the environment . However , it seems to be destroying its own habitat . Why ? Huh ? ( wheezing ) ( squealing ) ( sniffing and coughing ) Massive organic decay . That 's what we 're smelling . Yeah , but from where ? From what is the more salient question . Mercer . What ? You better take a look at this . My God ! Valentine : Your brother ? I 'm so sorry for you . What did this ? ( in native language ) A spider . ( in native language ) Fuck the sonofabitch that did this to you ! ( wheeze ) Capri : Web spiders produce seven different types of silk , sticky silk , web frame silk , egg sack silk , dragline ... cocoon silk . ( in native language ) ( Capri groans ) Capri : It 's injected some kind of nerve toxin into my spinal column . Now so I don 't feel much . Although my nose , does twitch occasionally . This is truly astounding . ( Capri laughs ) Okay , I 'm going to cut him loose . No , stop ! I beg you . This stuff is stronger than steel , and besides you can 't cut me from the cocoon anymore . My insides are feeding the eggs . Whose eggs ? What is this thing ? Capri : I don 't know . It 's spider-like . It 's massive . If it breeds successfully ... So all the other spiders are his offspring ? Yes , but they are not viable yet . It hasn 't found the right genetic combination . Leon : You 're saying a giant spider evolved in this island and it 's trying to further adapt by evolution ? No . Nothing so large and so alien could have evolved in our gravity . Alien ? ( rumbling ) ( in native language ) What ? What did you say ? ( in native language ) My God , is it here ? Out here somewhere . ( grunting ) ( grunting ) Capri : Oh please . What ? Kill me now . No ! Susana , get my kit . But he 's pumped with spider toxins , - he doesn 't know what he 's saying ! - Miss Mercer , Capri is dying ! ( Capri groans ) Can 't you give him something ? To cure him ? Leon : No . To help him . He 's right , Loren . It 'll take a few moments , okay ? ( Capri groans ) ( Capri sighs and whimpers ) All spiders go to heaven . Didn 't I read that in your book ? Please take my samples back with you . I would like this species to be named after me . Henri Capri . I 'll make sure . ( squelching ) For God 's sake , let 's go ! Leon : Let 's go , now ! ( squealing ) - For God 's sake , let 's go ! - Step back , now ! ( Toe Boy in Native Language ) Leon : Susana , run ! ( squealing ) ( in native language ) ( squelching ) ( squealing ) ( gunshots ) Let 's go ! ( squeals ) ( gunshots ) Enough ! No ! This thing 's not killing any more people ! Come on ! ( growling ) Valentine : Susana ! Wait ! Wait ! Shit ! Shit ! - Susana : Get me out of here ! - Hey ! Hey ! Get me out of here ! ( Toe Boy in native language ) Shit ! Help ! - ( squealing ) - Leon : Ahhh ! ( in native language ) ( squeals ) Get me out of here ! ( Leon screams ) ( squealing ) Susana : Help me , please . Mercer , I need some help . I got an idea . Okay , break it . - There . Come on . - Okay , retreat . Where 's Leon ? Leon ? ( growl ) Leon ? Susana : What is this place ? Valentine : Must be left over from the war . Okay . Check all the doors and windows . ( rattling ) There 's a storage room or something back there but it 's locked . We can 't get in . Mercer : Where 's Toe Boy ? I was just thinking , I 've never faced anything that I could not kill with a loaded gun and now , I don 't even have that , I 've got a 45 and a half a clip . Valentine : What about you ? About the same . I still have four rounds . ( clanging ) ( growling ) ( groaning ) ( clang ) Aww ! ( loud squealing ) Ahh ! ( squeals ) ( groaning ) ( heaving ) ( loud grunting ) ( groaning ) Ahh ! ( squeals ) Aww ! ( growls ) Uggh ! Susana : Where is it ? I don 't know . It didn 't penetrate much but I 'm not sure about the venom . I 'll be okay . Just sit down and rest ! I 'll barricade the windows and the doors . Can you work an M-16 ? You better believe it , sugar . Good . ( Valentine shivers ) How are you feeling ? I 'm cold . I 've got a fever . Thanks for asking . Anything interesting ? I don 't know . Let me see . Spiders are susceptible to drugs and toxins . Maybe there 's something in the med kit ? You think you want to get close enough to that thing to give it a shot ? I don 't know . If you come across anything interesting let me know . ( crackling ) ( thwak ) ( crackling ) Mercer : Quick Susana , get off your butt ! Now ! Go ! Go ! ( groaning ) ( squeals ) What 's it doing ? I don 't know ... ( squealing ) Mercer : But we can 't stay here . What about the back room ? ( squealing ) Shit ! Ahh ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . You 're the female equivalent of Tarzan . Jungles , I do fine . Small rooms and big spiders are a problem . ( heaving outside ) What ? I 'm not dead yet ? No , but you will if we don 't get you out . ( panting ) I don 't hear it . Mercer , do you think it 's gone ? I doubt it . I don 't see it . Take it easy , Susana . Take it easy . It 's not out there . Great , now take it easy . For God 's sake , I can 't stay in here . Yes we can , Susana . - It 's gone . Look ! - For God 's sake ! ( squealing ) Susana ! Ahh ! Susana ! ( screams ) ( squealing ) - ( thud ) - ( Screaming ) Fuck you ! ( spider squeals ) ( blast ) ( loud squeal ) Aggh ! - ( bang ) - Christ ! Shit ! ( bang ) Look , look ! - Mercer : What ? - Valentine : It must be a way out for the war . Open it ! ( bang ) Mercer : Ahh ! Are you coming ? ( spider squeals ) Ahh ! ( spider squeals ) Come on . Aggh ! Mercer : This way . We 're clear . Okay . Okay . I got to rest . Just for a minute . Oh my ... Man 's voice : Loren ... Mean and extreme , Loren . I 've been waiting for you . What took you so long ? Joli ... Uhh ! What 's wrong , Loren ? Don 't you like the new mother nature ? ( screams ) Oh , shit . What happened to you ? Ran into my man back at his village . He picked up your trail . Did you get anywhere on the radio ? No such luck , interference everywhere . Mercer : He 's got a fever . Where 's the rest ? Something back in the jungle ... killed my brother too . I want it , Bear . ( gun clicks ) I want it dead . That 's why me and my man are here . Aww ! Hey ... hey . Okay , I 'm going to leave you this . - No . - Just take it . I 'll be okay . Don 't worry . I 've got her covered . Hey , the next time you need a pilot , don 't call me . We 'll be back for you . Hooray ! Semper fi , me and mine . ( Mercer laughs ) - Go , let 's go . - Yep . ( snap ) Bear : What in the hell ? No , That 's it . That 's the cocoon . Mercer : It 's in molt . Bear : Molt ? When they come out of those things they 're usually soft . God , it 's breeding . Look at all those eggs . I 'm going up . Hey , hey , going where ? I got to take a closer look . Cover me , okay ? Shit ! Okay , it 's in here . I am going to try and get it down . Mercer : When I do , give it all you got . Shit . It 's not working . Oh no , Bear ! Bear , it 's waking up ! Oh my God , Bear ! Bear , get out ! Bear , get out of here ! Ahh ! No Bear ! Ahh ! Oh my God , Bear ! Ahh ! ( groaning ) ( spider screams ) Bear , no ! ( spider hisses ) Ahhh ! No ! Ahhh ! ( spider groans ) ( in native language ) Shit ! ( spider squeals ) ( spider crackling ) ( spider squeals ) ( squealing ) ( in native language ) ( squealing ) ( clank ) ( spider screams ) ( sighs ) Fuck ! ( Mercer whimpers ) ( heaving ) ( spider squeals ) ( snipping ) ( spider squeals ) ( Mercer whimpers ) ( groaning ) ( loud squeal ) ( grunting ) ( spider squeals ) ( whimpers ) ( spider roaring ) Shit ! No fucking way ! Aggh ! ( ripping ) ( crackles ) ( spider heaves ) Fuck ! I hate spiders . Take it easy . - Is it dead ? - Yeah , it 's dead . Okay . Let 's get the hell out of here ! Come on . ( heavy breathing )

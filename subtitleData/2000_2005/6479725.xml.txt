Come the next level , I 'm a death machine . [ Lo-Fat ] Whoo ! Yeah ! [ Man 's Voice On Speaker ] Status : Combat ready . Situation : Guerrilla units in the immediate vicinity ... of insertion module . [ Alarm Continues ] Whoo ! Yeah ! - Let 's do this ! - Bring it on ! - T-minus ten , nine , - Look at these heart rates . - Eight , seven , six , - If I don 't let these boys out , they 're gonna kill each other . - Five , four , - Come on ! Yeah ! Three , two , one . - Engage . - Whoo ! Do you see ' em ? They 're out there , geeks , looking to fry your huevos . [ Engines Roaring ] Call it , Retro ! Call it ! Now ! Whoa ! It 's a total massacre out there . Phase two , geeks . - Ready , knuckleheads ? - Flank right ! - Flank left ! - Go ! [ Shouting ] [ Shouting ] [ Excited Whooping ] [ Groaning ] - [ Electricity Sparking ] - [ Loud Groaning ] Lo-Fat 's down . - [ Screaming ] - [ Electricity Sparking ] [ Sighs ] - You got me , Moxie ? - Got you covered . - Retro 's in . - Adrenaline redline . The blood thirst is unquenchable . [ Machine Gun Fire Continues ] [ Panting ] [ Grunts ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] Moxie ? Who 's there ? [ Kisses ] Who are you ? I am Maitreya . This is my game . [ Gasps ] Agents Mulder and Scully . F.B.I. We 're expected . I need to scan your I.D. Retina scan , please . Cool . Ma 'am ? I 'll need you to look over those nondisclosure agreements . " To protect all proprietary or intellectual property ... " owned by FPS , a private California corporation , under the harshest penalty of the law . " Signature at the bottom , please . - FPS . - First Person Shooter . - Video games . - Digital entertainment . I can get into the Pentagon easier than this . Dudes ! Agent Mulder , what 's up , wild man ? Welcome to the land where silicon meets silicone . Can I get you a latte from the bar , or perhaps a bottle of designer H2O ? Scully ? How ' bout a simple explanation as to why we 're here ? Why don 't we take a brief moment to feel the pulse of the new American gold rush ? You 're standing on the launch pad of a rocket headed for the stars . Okay . There 's been a little accident . [ Scully ] What kind of accident ? [ Langly ] Like an industrial accident . - How did the victim die ? - It 's not exactly clear . - Right . - Was there equipment involved ? - No . - Yes . - Yes and no . - What 's your business here ? - Our business ? - Yeah . We 're ... We 're consultants to FPS . Langly did some programming for them . - He created all of the bad guys . - Only the Euro-goons . We don 't want to give you the idea that we 're major profit participants . Cash or stock options ? Options . Preferred rate . Vested immediately with a short-term exercise against venture collateral ... to bypass S.E.C. Regs . - The I.P.O. ' s in a week . - Game ships on Friday . Fifty malls across the United States and Japan . Only there 's a dead body between you and untold riches . I don 't know about you guys , but I 'd be checking my shorts for cake . - This man 's been shot . - No ! See , when somebody is shot , there 's a gun involved , right ? That is absolutely impossible because there 's no way anybody could get a gun past security . What do you call this ? That 's a laser blaster for wasting cyber-trash . - It emits a low-frequency ... - Just let me ! All right . The weapons feed off the FPS mainframe . The effect is intensely real , but harmless . You say this weapon is a toy , but this man clearly has gunshot wounds ... - through his ... - Stun suit . It 's rigged with paint for wounds and kill shots . Total bleeding-edge technology . - He 's dead . I got it . - Who was he playing against ? Against the game . You waste the cyber-thugs before they waste you . It 's all about body count . But they 're computer-generated images ... running on a projector . It all happens in the game space . It 's a total digital environment . Nothing 's real . It 's all virtual . Did anybody see what happened ? I was in the control booth with Ivan . Retro was in the zone . His telemetry was solid . He looked unstoppable , like he was on his way to the next level , when suddenly he was cooked meat . Well , the next call 's gonna be to the local P.D. No cops ! No cops . You said no cops . You said you had connections . Connections or not , you 've got a murder victim here . Headlines ! Just what the Wall Street money dudes want to read as we 're goin ' to market . Just what the Wall Street money dudes want to read as we 're goin ' to market . Yes , this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I. You said you were in the control booth when it happened ? Can you tell me exactly what you saw ? - [ Keyboard Clacking ] - [ Phoebe ] I 'm still not sure if we even saw it . I mean , one minute everything was going perfect , and then we crashed . Ivan and I were sitting here . We both just looked at each other . It happened so fast . [ Beeping ] Moxie 's covering Retro , who 's going inside after the enemy to rack up beaucoup points . And then " goosh , " Retro 's vitals spike like he 's been shot . And the system defaults . [ Phoebe ] And they 're right back in the game space . Lo-Fat , get over here ! What happened ? Retro ? What 's wrong ? - Lights out . Game over . - What 's wrong , man ? What happened ? What happened in there ? We don 't know . There 's no res images on interior game spaces . What about the wire frame ? Maybe I can . I 'll strip down to wire frame display . Um , I mean ... we 've never mapped this area before . Retro was in noncombat space . - It 's a chick . - It can 't be . Can you texture-wrap her ? - [ Typing ] - [ Clears Throat ] - Holy Toledo ! - She 's packin ' a flintlock . That ain 't all she 's packin ' . Can you print that out for me ? Goddess . Let me get this straight , Agent Scully . You got no murder weapon , no forensic evidence , no motive , no suspect . Scully . My partner Agent Mulder . This is Detective Lacoeur . - Have you got something ? - Yeah , our killer , I believe . Hey , I 'll put out an A.P.B. For Frederick 's of Hollywood . Mulder , you 're not serious . It 's all in the computer . Mulder , that 's any voluptuous vixen out of any number of video games . She 's not in " any video game . " She 's in this one , and no one programmed her in . Yeah , but even if they had , she 's not real . She 's a character . She 's-She 's some immature , hormonal fantasy . Darryl Musashi . You see who that is ? - Darryl Musashi . - As I live and breathe . - Who 's Darryl Musashi ? - The O.G. Original Guru . Word is he slums as a game designer when he 's not contracted to the C.I.A. - The boy wonder of virtual mayhem . - What 's he doing here ? Ivan must have called him to go in and slay the ninja babe . Mulder , why does this game have the effect ... of reducing grown men back to moony adolescence ? That 's Darryl Musashi ! [ Groans ] Mulder . - Huh . - Do you want me to autopsy the body ? [ Voice On Speaker ] Emerging module into set mode . T-minus 20 seconds . Pay attention , worms . Darryl Musashi 's gonna show us how this game 's supposed to be played . I heard he scored 90 consecutive wins on Demon Space Drifter . - Ninety-one . - Look at him . The man 's a sphinx . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - T-minus ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Engage . Hey , Byers , you gotta see this . Mulder , get over here . - Is that him ? Is that Darryl Musashi ? - Yeah , that 's him . He just stepped into the game . - Why is he just standing there ? - Because he knows no fear . [ Engines Revving ] - Yeah ! - Unbelievable . - Standing heart rate is 68 . - He hasn 't even broken a sweat . Look at him . He 's not even waiting for the reset . He 's going right for the kill . [ Grunting , Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] What just happened ? She cut off his hands . [ Screaming Continues ] [ Whispering In Japanese ] [ Sword Slices , Head Thuds ] [ Sustained Beep ] Preliminary external examination of deceased , a 20-ish male , name listed only as " Retro , " offers no additional clues as to actual cause of death . Scratch that . Cause of death is from a large entry wound at the sternum ... resulting in trauma to the internal organs ... and blood loss . Wound is consistent with a high-velocity impact ... from a large projectile ... which passed through a three-ply Kevlar jacket . Scratch that . Wound is the result of high-velocity impact ... from an unknown object ... which , even if it did enter the body , left no damn trace evidence whatsoever . No powder burns , no chemical signatures ... of any kind of explosive propellant . - No luck ? - I thought I was on to something . You know , Mulder , this suit holds more than just exploding paint cells . It measures the player 's vital signs , from the heart rate to the extant body chemistry , and then sends that information back to the computer . Then when a player is shot , a battery pack sends a 12-volt jolt ... that keeps him from getting up until the game is over . Virtual death . Yeah . Well , if only that were the case . - Yeah . - I thought at first that maybe the suit had malfunctioned , that one of the charges had blown inward . But unfortunately , that wasn 't the case either . I 've got a birthday coming up . You have to admit , though , Scully , this is a pretty amazing piece of technology . - Yeah . Wasted on a stupid game . - Stupid ? Dressing up like high-tech warriors ... to play a futuristic version of cowboys and Indians . What kind of moron gets his ya-yas out like that ? Mulder , what purpose does this game serve ... except to add to a culture of violence in a country that 's already out of control ? - Who says it adds to it ? - You think that taking up weapons ... and creating gratuitous virtual mayhem ... has any redeeming value whatsoever ? That the testosterone frenzy that it creates stops when the game does ? That 's rather sexist , isn 't it ? I mean , maybe the game provides an outlet for certain impulses , that it fills a void in our genetic makeup ... that the more civilizing effects of society fail to provide for us . That must be why men feel the great need to blast the crap out of stuff . Well , testosterone frenzy or no , the only suspect we have in this man 's murder is a woman . Yeah , I 've seen it . A computer-animated woman , Mulder , with a computer-animated weapon . A flintlock pistol , which would leave a very large entry wound . Pictures don 't kill people . Guns kill people . As do swords . The world-renowned Darryl Musashi . [ Phone Rings ] [ Rings ] Mulder . You 're kidding . - Thanks . - [ Phone Beeps ] L.A. Sheriff 's Department just picked up a female suspect for the murders . [ Excited Chattering ] [ Laughing ] Who 's the man ? He 's the man . He 's the man with the badge ! You get the feeling these men have something better to do ? I mean , is that legal ? Uh , we picked her up outside of a strip club in Reseda . Fits your description to a " T. " - Was she read her rights ? - About 500 times . - [ Men Laughing ] - Oh , yeah . [ Laughing ] For the record , can you state your name , please ? For the record , can you state your name , please ? For the record again , my name is Jade Blue Afterglow . I reside ... - I 'm sorry . Your real name ? - That is my real name . What were you expecting ? Mildred ? No . I sure seem to be upsetting a lot of people around here . Well , you 're not upsetting me , Miss , uh ... Afterglow . I sure upset the man running the metal detector . You say that you have no knowledge of Ivan Martinez ... or a company known as First Person Shooter , or FPS . I meet a lot of men . Would it surprise you to know that you have been placed at a crime scene ... in the offices of FPS ? Let 's just say it takes a whole lot to surprise me . You might want to start telling the truth . And what truth am I not telling you ? That you murdered two men , one with a 14th-century broadsword , and the other with a flintlock pistol . Oh . You must have had me confused with my sister . Xena , warrior princess . Are you denying that this is you ? - Now I get it . - What ? The medical imaging place in Culver City . I got paid to let them do this body-scan thing . They paid you to scan your body ? You think that 's the strangest thing I 've been paid to do ? We 're very sorry , Miss Afterglow , but ... Uh , we 're sorry . You 're free to go . I don 't know about you , Scully , but I am feeling the great need ... to blast the crap out of something . - Hello ? - Anybody here ? [ Quiet Moan ] [ Light Switch Clicking ] Phoebe ? Hey , you okay ? Boy , I must have fell asleep . I was just thinking of taking a nap . I 've been up for 70 hours straight analyzing code , trying to fix the game . - Where is everybody ? Where 's Ivan ? - Um , he 's with the money guys . They 're all freaking . We need to talk to him right away about a woman named Jade Blue Afterglow . He scanned her body and he created the character out of her . - He put her in the game . - Hey , what are they doing ? Oh . The Lone Gunmen are on the floor . Langly and I wrote a software patch . - We 're going to run a res-up test on the game . - What for ? To bypass the problem . - Hey . - What just happened ? Oh , I don 't know . - They 're in the game . - Hey , Phoebe , are you paying attention ? [ Byers ] You 're supposed to wait until we said we were ready . [ Langly ] What the hell 's going on ? [ Byers ] Phoebe , come on . - What 's happening ? - Anyone up there running the program ? I don 't believe this . The program 's running itself . - Phoebe ! - This can 't be happening . Somebody 's shooting at them . This is supposed to be background only . There wasn 't supposed to be any game play . They need help . Mulder ! [ Gunfire Continues ] [ Voice On Speaker ] Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . - Engage . - Bring it on . - You guys okay ? - We 've been better . - Byers has been hit . - I 'm okay . It 's a flesh wound . [ Groans ] It 's her . She 's out there . She nailed Byers with that flintlock . Okay , on the count of three , I 'm gonna lay down some cover , fellas . You ready ? One , two , three . Mulder ! Get in the module ! - What is he doing ? - Don 't go after her ! Get back here ! - He 's getting his ya-yas out . - We 're not defaulting the program ! - Mulder ! - It 's suicide ! Put the sword down . [ Machine Gun Fire ] [ Frohike ] Mulder ? - Oh , no . - [ Door Opening ] Where 's Mulder ? I said , where 's Mulder ? Maybe you guys didn 't hear me . Come on , guys . Where is he ? We don 't know . He just took off after her . - I saw what he did , but where did he go ? - He went into the building . - He was firing his weapon . - I saw where he went ! I want to know where he is . Is there a door or an exit or some kind of passageway that he could have used ? Just the one you came in . - He should be right here . - It 's impossible . It 's a digital environment . - It 's just a game . - Yeah . - Easy for you to say . - [ Phoebe ] Agent Scully ! I found him . This monitors everyone playing the game . There ... player four . - It 's his telemetry . - What do you mean ? Player four . That 's him . - On the monitor . - Right there . - Where ? - That 's Mulder . - He 's alive . - Those are his vitals . - He 's still in the game . - Yes , but where 's the game ? Frohike ! Langly ! Byers ! [ Footsteps ] - I think that 's it . - Yeah . - What are you doing ? - We 're rerouting the circuitry . - Making a kill switch so we can shut down the game . - Don 't touch that . I mean , it won 't work . There 's no way to do that . We are back in business ! Baby , you are dope . What ? We were toast . I felt the flames licking my ass . Then the bankers saw the letters on the autopsy ... " F.B.I. Cause of death : Unknown . " [ Giggling ] You fixed our problems . The game 's gonna ship , and we 're gonna be countin 'Franklins . Yeah , and you 're gonna be countin ' teeth . - Her partner 's lost in the game . - Lost ? - The game has disappeared . - What are you talking about ? Jade Blue Afterglow . Does that ring a bell ? Jade Blue Afterglow ? - Oh , you 'd remember her . - [ Grunts ] Hey ! Phoebe ! I don 't know how it happened . You knew about her ? Then it was you . You scanned that woman 's body . Into my computer . She was my creation . She was mine . - But why ? - You don 't know what it 's like ... day in and day out , choking in a haze of rampant testosterone . I wouldn 't be so sure . I mean , she was all I had to keep me sane , my only way to strike back as a woman . She was my goddess , everything I can never be . But , Phoebe , she is still a killer . I can 't explain it , but she is , and you put her in that game . No , I didn 't . I was creating my own game in my own computer . It was totally secret . I never told anyone . But somehow she jumped programs , and she 's feeding off the male aggression . It 's making her stronger and stronger . I need your help . You 're the only one who can understand . - You 've got to destroy her , Phoebe . - I don 't know how . Well , there 's got to be some way . There 's got to be some vulnerability or a weakness somewhere . She has no weakness anymore . [ Sighs ] Hey ! [ Beeping ] Bet you think you 're gonna kick my butt up and down the block . Okay . Her name is Maitreya . - Maitreya ? - She 's input herself into the game . - We have to download her . - We can 't even get on-line . - The system 's been hijacked . - The program won 't respond . [ Scully ] Frohike , what 's wrong ? - What is that ? - Mulder 's vitals are wiggy . - What ? - They 're all over the map . This is your fault . - You put her here . - Hey ! No fair pickin on a girl . [ Shouts ] [ Keyboard Clicking ] We 're back on-line . - There 's no picture . - No , we 're just in res-up . No , there 's something wrong . - That 's not the game . - Yes , it is . It 's level two . - How did that happen ? - Where 's Mulder ? Mulder 's in level one . - [ Ivan ] No , he 's right there . - Shut the game down . No , no . No , no . I can 't . - Well , just turn it off . - [ Byers ] Power down , Langly . [ Beeping ] - The computer 's not responding . - Look , we have to get him out of there ! Yeah , and quick . Whoa ! Stop right there ! That 's not really fair , is it ? Well , that 's just cheating . [ Metal Clanging ] - Go , girl ! - Scully 's on fire ! - The blood thirst in unquenchable ! - Are you witnessing this ? - Oh , yeah . - Scully 's in the zone ! - Clearly . - What 's wrong ? This is level two . It only gets harder . No one 's ever beaten level two . - Are you okay ? - Ask me if I 'm humiliated . [ Door Motor Humming ] Mulder . - [ Byers ] This is nuts ! - They 'll never make it . - How do you kill something that won 't die ? - Try and stop me , Ivan . - My whole life is in this game ! - What are you trying to do ? - Stay out of this ! - She 's gonna destroy it . - It 's the only way to save them . - Let it go , both of you ! - You can save them ? - There 's a kill command . - It kills the whole game . - You knew about this ? - She knew about it too . - You said it wouldn 't work . She was trying to save her creation , her goddess . You don 't care who dies as long as your game survives . - Our friends are in there . - And we 're not gonna let them die . Mulder ? Give me that ! This is out of your hands now . - Shut down the program . - You 're the only ones that can do it . - They can 't keep this up . - Scully 's running out of ammo . - What 's the command ? - Don 't do it , Phoebe . We 're so close . - The command . - Give it to him . Shift-Alt-Blood Bath . Oh , my God . We killed the game , and Mulder and Scully along with it . Over here ! - Scully ! - Mulder ! Scully ! That 's entertainment ! [ Mulder Narrating ] We came , we saw , we conquered . And if the taste of victory is sweet , the taste of virtual victory is not Sweet ' N Low , nor the bullets made of sugar . Maybe out past where the imagination ends , our true natures lie , waiting to be confronted on their own terms . Out where the intellect is at war with the primitive brain ... in the hostile territory of the digital world ... where laws are silent and rules disappear in the midst of arms . Born in anarchy , with an unquenchable blood thirst , we shudder to think what might rise up from the darkness . [ Child ] I made this ! [ Man ] AJell-O salad with little pear chunks . It 's the Wednesday special at the hospital cafeteria . I can 't escape it . Listen to you . That didn 't stop you from eating my dessert . Well , all right . The profiteroles weren 't bad . - [ Beeping ] - You didn 't want me to starve , did you ? He ate mine too . Daddy , why don 't you take this before my arm falls off . Thanks , honey . [ Grunts ] Everybody ? - One last shot . - Oh , Dad . Do you think we can draw the line at 600 photographs ? Six hundred and one . Quit griping . And hold up that eyesore , Robert . God knows when you 're gonna win another one . Irv , you wanna think about staying the night ? - It 's awful late to head back to the city . - Yeah . What ? I get to stay at the home of the Bay Area Doctor of the Year ? It 's a deal . Proud of you , Robert . Up . Hold it up . Say " cheese . " " Presented to Dr. Robert Wieder M. D ... " for the great wisdom , skill and compassion ... he exhibits in the practice of medicine . " It 's gonna look awfully nice in your office . What are you thinking ? How this is just the cherry on top . How lucky I am . [ Beeping ] - What is it ? - Downstairs motion sensor . You think Dad tripped the alarm ? The alarm hasn 't been tripped . You got me . I 'll go check it out . Irv ? Irving , is everything all right ? What do you think , Scully ? Is this a name , possibly , or a code or an anagram ? T-H-E-E-F . I assume it 's supposed to be T-H-l-E-F . Thief . Insert your own Dan Quayle joke here . Lousy spelling aside , what do you think it refers to ? Who 's the thief ? [ Scully ] Well , that 's certainly one question . I 've got many . " Mulder , why are we here ? " Mmm , to be fair , I might have used the words , " Mulder , how is this an X-File ? " You see that , Scully ? You always keep me guessing . This is Dr. Irving Thalbro , age 66 , found hanged with his throat cut , his family tucked away and in bed not 40 feet from here . Didn 't see or hear anything . Which would certainly shine the light of suspicion on them . Except they 're the ones that called it in , and there 's no evidence whatsoever to link them to the crime . Which is why the police are rightly wondering ... if Dr. Thalbro killed himself . Except who , then , did this ? Blood pattern doesn 't indicate that the good doctor did it , who I am assuming could read and write above a fourth grade level . I 'll admit , Mulder , this is not an open-and-shut case . But , uh , it doesn 't make it an X-File . Well , there is one detail that does . This . Dirt ? Dirt . It 's a very powerful component of hexcraft , as well as the pattern in which it was originally arranged . Check this out . - Looks like a human form . - [ Sighs ] Hexcraft , as in putting a curse on someone ? Murdering them magically ? That 's what it looks like to me . Now , I know what you 're gonna say , Scully . No , hexcraft . I mean , I 'll buy that as the intent here . It certainly jives with the evidence . I say we talk to the family . I 'll always keep you guessing . It was probably the greatest night of my life . Till ... Sir , can you think of any enemies your father-in-law might have made ? Maybe inadvertently through his medical practice ... or a business dealing , perhaps ? Everybody loved Irving . Everyone who knew him . He was ... No , I can 't conceive of it . Dr. Wieder , do you have any enemies ? I 'm sorry I have to ask . There was a message left behind . If it doesn 't refer to your father-in-law , it may refer to you . [ Girl ] thief ? Are you asking if my dad 's a thief ? He saves people 's lives . He 's a good man . Honey . If I have any enemies , I don 't know them . At the home of his son-in-law , Dr. Robert Wieder , Dr. Irving Thalbro was found hanged at 1 : 48 this morning . The details are sketchy . It 's my understanding ... that police are treating the case as a murder . This is due in part to core evidence left at the scene . [ TVContinues , Indistinct ] [ Sniffing ] Hello ? Mr. Peattie ? Mr. Peattie , I know you 're in there . Are you cooking ? You aren 't supposed to be cooking . You aren 't supposed to be cooking . That smell like somethin you wanna eat ? - Well , what is it , then ? - Medicine . Oh , all right . Uh , just so long as you 're not cooking . Seems like you could use yourself a poultice for your back . Old Peattie fix ya right up . Be ready later . [ Chanting , Indistinct ] - Scully . This dirt we found ? Gas pneumatograph shows ... - Mm-hmm . Pronounced spikes of methane and sulfur compounds . The signature of decay . It 's graveyard dirt , also known as conjure dust . It 's one of the most powerful hexing elements , whether for good or evil . Not the kind of stuff you want to be on the wrong end of . Uh-huh . Well , go ahead , Scully . Keep me guessing . Kuru . The-The , uh ... The disease that New Guinea tribesmen get ? From eating the brains of their relatives . I thought my grandpa slurping his soup was bad . Practically speaking , Mulder , Kuru doesn 't even exist anymore , not in New Guinea and certainly not in the U.S. But this man 's cerebellum and his triadim ... clearly show signs of it , Mulder . I mean , these plaques ... his brain is riddled with them . Kuru makes you crazy , right ? Yeah , stark-raving , among other things . But in this case , stark-raving mad enough to slit his own throat and hang himself . Mulder , that 's what his autopsy shows ... from the wound pattern to-to the blood spray . - This man did it to himself . There 's no question . - Unless ... it was inflicted upon him . The graveyard dirt , the hex . He was given this disease so that he would kill himself . Nan ? Honey ? Robert ? Look at this . It could be they needed it as evidence . [ Chattering Continues ] I 'm telling you , I 'm scared . I can 't stay here , Robert . I can 't live in this house anymore . Lucy can 't , not after what 's happened here . And now this picture of us is missing . - It 'll turn up . - No . It doesn 't make any sense . Nothing that 's happened here makes any sense . It does . Nan , listen to me . Your dad was ill . He had a kind of progressive dementia . That 's what the F.B.I. Autopsy showed . I reviewed their findings , and I have to agree . Honey , we will get through this . - Oh , my God ! Nan , honey ! - [ Groaning ] Oh , my God ! - Nan ! - Dad ? Lucy , call 911 . Call 911 ! Nan ! [ Chanting , Indistinct ] [ Beeping ] Dr. Wieder ? We understand you 've made a diagnosis . Diffuse Cutaneous Flesh Moniliasis . Old World type . - I take it that 's rare . - In San Francisco ? It 's unheard of . Maybe in Central Africa . - Well , the rarer , the better . - What do you mean by that ? Someone directed this to happen to your wife ... just as someone directed what happened to your father-in-law . My enemy you were talking about ... the one who thinks I 'm a thief ? Agent , you 're a doctor . Explain to your partner ... that no one can direct a person to get sick . The dirt you found in your bed drawn in the shape of a body , that 's indicative of folk magic . That 's what I believe is being used against you . Folk magic ? You mean , like , Babayaga ? Gypsies ? I was actually thinking less Eastern and more Celtic . Maybe Scots-Irish or Appalachian , even . I 'm supposed to take this seriously ? Sir , regardless of the particulars , I think it 's clear that there was an intruder in your home . And I think it would be prudent for you ... to accept our protection ... and help us to identify this person . Prudent for me would be to continue treating my wife . If we don 't stop who 's causing this , your treatments won 't matter . So modern medicine and all it encompasses ... artificial hearts , laser surgery , gene therapy , to name a few ... all of that arrayed against a pile of magic dirt ? And you tell me I 'll lose . I have M.R.I. S to look at . Oh , yeah , Mulder , win him over . He will lose unless we can find a way to stop it . What do you suggest ? A second opinion . [ Chuckling ] The truth always hurts , don 't it , Doc ? Who are you ? Is this you ? You did this ? What do you want from me ? Don 't you be frettin ' none about that . I 'm gettin my nickel 's worth . You 're doin a fine job so far . What the hell are you talking about ? What is this all about ? Lynette Peattie . And don 't you be sayin you don 't recollect her . Uh-uh . No , no , no . Look , if I 've done anything to upset you , I ... It 's no use trying to intimidate me if I don 't know how I 've offended you ! Tell me ! What makes me a thief ? You be a smart man . I figure ... you ponder it a while , it gonna come to ya . Wait ! [ Keyboard Clacking ] [ Sighs ] No . No matter how I spell it , there 's no Lynette Peattie . - She 's not in my patient file . - She 's not in any doctor 's patient file . No one by that name has ever been admitted to the hospital . You think you treated her ? What aboutJane Does ? You treated three in the last two years . Pull the files , please . You remember old Boon . I know you do . This mangy , old , ugly dog . Smart . People-smart , and then some . Oh , he sure did love you . He crawled up under that house ... the very day you left . Wouldn 't come out for nothin ' . Not no ham bone , nothin ' . He just knew that his life was over . You stole his heart too . You shouldn 't oughta left . [ Footsteps ] [ Gasps ] You 're there . I ... wanted to thank you . That poultice worked a miracle on my back . I was about to knock and ... and ask if I could get a little more . Whatever that is , it sure is stinky . Stinky 's good . [ Chimes Ringing ] [ Woman ] Good afternoon . Can I help you ? Yeah , we 're looking for some alternative medical advice . Well , you 've come to the right place . I get a lot of folks fed up with their H.M.O.s. - Well , actually , we 're not here for us . - Yeah . Oh ! Chief , back in your pocket . It 's dirt . It 's goofer dust is what it is . I don 't know what your intentions are with that . - Goofer dust ? - Conjure dust , goofer dust . How would you go about making somebody sick using that ? We 're investigating a murder . That 's why I 'm asking . Oh . Speaking strictly in the academic sense , you 'd spread it on or near your victim to direct misfortune . So you could give them any illness you wanted ... - one that you chose specifically for them ? - Oh ... that 's a lot trickier . It requires something special . - A voodoo doll . - No . They 're called " puppets . " Inside , you place three thorns of a blood red rose , a strand of hair , and a photo of your victim . Maybe other items as well . Depends on the operator . Sew it up , say your spell . How would you counteract one of these ? Depends on who you 're dealing with . But if the person you 're looking for ... is powerful enough to bring about a murder , he 's probably charmed . Which would mean what ? It means just that . He 's drawing on the energy of a charm . A source of magic power . It could be any item , provided that it 's very important to him . Something that holds great meaning for him . And unless you can separate him from his charm , you 're out of luck . Poppin ' corn . You gotta put the money in first . Don 't look like no popping ' corn to me . Put it in the microwave . Then you get your popcorn . Oh . Microwave . I heard tell of such a thing . It 's a true wonder . [ Beeping ] Radiation . Come from the heart of the atom . I think it be God 's own glow . You 're gonna be very happy , I promise . The drug therapy I 'm giving her is working wonders . Come on . Come see . - Mom . - Hi , sweetie . - You look good . - Yeah , right . But I am definitely feeling better . - So how come I have to go through this thing again ? - Come on . This thing gives off about as much radiation as a dental X ray . - Nothing to worry about . - I know . It just scares me . Wish me luck ? [ Beeping ] Doctor ! Switch it off ! Switch it off ! [ Gasps ] [ Beeping ] All done . How could somebody orchestrate all of this ? You believe that your wife was murdered ? It was no accident . There was no malfunction of the machine . Yes , I believe she was murdered . And you still have no idea why ? The pathologist found this branded into your wife 's chest . Sir , we can 't help you if you withhold information from us . A man came to see me yesterday . My age , older , maybe . Tall . He mentioned someone named Lynette Peattie . I didn 't know who she was at first . Turns out she was a Jane Doe I treated last October . She was in a bus rollover . Came in amid a wave of victims . She was the worst off . I could barely put fluids in fast enough to keep up with the blood loss . We were rushing around triaging people . Everybody knew she was dying . It was only a matter of time . She was in agony . This was my course of treatment . [ Scully ] You gave her morphine . Lots of it . I pushed it myself . She kept screaming , and her heart rate kept climbing . So ... I kept pushing . I took maybe the last 20 minutes of her life . It was a fair trade to make for the pain . Her father doesn 't agree . What makes you think it 's her father ? He thinks you robbed him of his family . And that 's why he 's systematically robbing you of yours . What am I supposed to do ? My daughter Lucy ... You don 't do anything . Let us find a way to protect you . - How ? - I have an idea where to start . [ Scully ] If Lynette Peattie was Carlos theJackal , I would 've had an easier time tracking her down . There 's no birth certificate , no social security number , nothing . Better known to the world as Jane Doe , 6149 . Well , her name shows up once in the records ... of a Vista Inoculation Program in 1981 . - The Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia . - Deepest Appalachia . That 's when her father , one Oral Peattie , refused to allow her to be inoculated against polio . But there 's no address for him . There 's no record of him whatsoever . Mulder , why are we exhuming this girl ? Well , I 'm thinking of her dear old backwoods dad ... and where he gets all his graveyard dirt . Here ? His daughter 's grave ? The occultist we spoke to said that the person ... casting these magic spells was charmed . That he had a source of power that was very meaningful to him ... and he kept it close by . Lynette Peattie 's body ? That 's my guess . So as long as her body remains here resting in peace in the Bay Area , he remains powerful . But if we were to ship it off to Quantico ... Hold onto that . Mr. Peattie ? Mr. Peattie , my pain 's back . I was wondering if I could get a little more of that poultice . Mr. Peattie ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you were home . [ Screaming ] All right , thank you . They 'll be there before dark . - You all set ? - We still don 't know where it is we 're going . We rented a cabin for you . It 's important that you get out of town . And you believe by our leaving it will somehow weaken him ? Well , what 's important is that he believes that . At any rate , if he can 't find you , he can 't hurt you . How do you know he 'll come forward ? Because he hasn 't gotten everything he wants . [ Man On TV ] Our ownJohn Gillness is on the scene . [ Man # 2 ] San Mateo County health officials admit they 're at a loss ... to explain the sudden onset of the 56-year-old woman 's bizarre illness , but insist there is no cause for alarm . - Pretty weird , huh ? - There 's been no official diagnosis . Sources say they believe the woman contracted ... the rare but deadly Group " A " Streptococcus ... - better known as the flesh-eating disease . - Freakin ' scary . We will keep a close watch on this story and any new developments . [ Man ] Bathroom 's clear ! [ Man # 2 ] Clear here ! [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Scully . - Peattie may be on to us . - What happened ? - I found out where he lives , only he 's cleared out and he 's taken his magic charm with him . At least as much of it as he can carry . My guess is he 's looking for you . I didn 't see anybody following us . Well , just keep an eye out , Scully . I 'm on my way . Okay . Soon . Very soon . [ Robert ] What was that ? Stay where you are . [ Chanting , Indistinct ] Oh ! Oh , God ! - Oh ! - What is it ? I don 't know . I can 't ... - I can 't see ! - [ Banging On Door ] - Agent Scully ! - Just stay where you are . Stay down . [ Gasps ] - Oh , Doctor ! - Leave him alone ! - Daddy ! - Get back ! Get back ! Don 't make me hurt you ! [ Peattie ] Can hurt the man that ain 't got nothin 'left . You know who I be now ? Maybe you can recollect my daughter . I remember ! I never forgot ! I 'm-I 'm sorry for your loss , but I did everything humanly possible to save her ! The arrogant little man . I did everything I could ! And when I couldn 't do anymore , I eased her suffering ! By killing ' her . If I be there , I save her ! You weren 't there ! [ Peattie ] Scary death in some field . No name on her , far away from her people . It wouldn 't be right . So now , little man , I gonna show you what be possible . I 'm gonna show you ... an eye for an eye . You 're not gonna hurt my daughter ! Daddy ! [ Sobbing ] Baby . - [ Groaning ] - Daddy ! Daddy ! Doctor ? What 's happening ? - Daddy ! - [ Gasping ] Dr. Wieder ! - [ Screaming ] - You 're killing him ! [ Sobbing ] Daddy ! Stop ! Daddy ! - Daddy ! - [ Gunshot ] [ Sobbing ] Daddy . [ Monitor Beeping ] Lynette Peattie 's body is on its way back home to O 'Neal , West Virginia . She 's going back to her people after all . You know , Mulder , I would have made the same call . As a doctor , if I was certain that I couldn 't save her life ... and she was in that much pain , - I would 've done what Wieder did . - Mm-hmm . It seems pretty clear cut . Except maybe it 's not . You 're wondering if maybe Peattie could 've saved her life ? You do keep me guessing . [ Child ] I made this !

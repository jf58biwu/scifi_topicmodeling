 Why the hezmana don 't we just jettison this thing into frelling space ! Crichton- - First he wants to question these creatures , then he wants to bury them ! I mean , why don 't we just open the last chamber and ask them where Earth is . And then he 'll die in the first 30 microts , like this one did . Well , death isn 't always a bad thing , Aeryn . Who wants to live when your place in the universe has been suspended . Jothee and Chiana are just kids , D 'Argo . I don 't want to discuss it . They were rebelling , they weren 't trying to ... Rebelling ! Rebelling is smoking some galla root . Rebelling is not sleeping with ... Aghhh ! Look , D 'Argo , if you want to talk ... I 'm not ready . Now , that ship , I 'd like to jettison . What if there 's some weapon aboard we can use ? What if the next system we set off destroys us all We 're already destroyed , Aeryn . It 's just that some of us don 't know it yet . I am as concerned about Zhaan 's welfare as you , Commander . However ... Stark says that we gotta get her into the ground ... soon ... how long ? Ahh ! A planet meeting Zhaan 's atmospheric requirements is less than an arn away ! So hetch it up , baby . Come on , let 's go . I simply thought you 'd like to see this before it went away . What ? Holy ... Pilot , take readings . Complete spectrum roll , diffuse electron analysis across the electromagnetic range . It 's only theoretical but , look for a dimensional bend in the halo effect . Commander ... I know , I know . Zhaan . Look , scan on the parabolic curve , give me a chance to dip in for some readings , prepare to launch my module . Commander ! Pilot ! My call . There 's a ship approaching ... I ... I think . Where ? Not sure . These readings can 't be ! Pilot , save the ' golly-gee-whiz ' for later . Just tell me where it is . It 's travelling too fast . Too ... impossible . All right . So far I 've got ' not sure ' , 'can 't be ' , and ' impossible ' . Where the hell is it ? Up there ! Pilot ! Starburst ! My name is John Crichton , I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe . I 'm trying to stay alive . Aboard this ship ... this living ship of escaped prisoners ... my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ? Protect my home ? Not show them ... you exist . But then you 'll never know ... the wonders I 've seen . Pilot ... Pilot ! That ain 't ... part of Moya- - What the hell ? Aeryn ? ! D 'Argo ! Zhaan ! Pilot ! Commander ... what ... did we ... ? I don 't know ! Some kind of collision . You okay ? ! Moya and I ... are ... hard-hard to think . Neeyala ! We have extensive damage ! Alien penetration of our vessel ! An impact during phase resolution . What the hell did you do to Moya ? ! We must maintain integrity as described . Crichton , my comms aren 't wor ... What did you do ? ! Neeyala ! Back off ... it carries a weapon ! Get on the ground , now ! Get on the ground ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Whoa-whoa , stop it-stop it . I don 't think they understand what we 're saying . What the frell happened ? Dear Goddess , help ... Moya is in agony ! Someone answer ! Tier 3 is dark , ruptures everywhere Zhaan , D 'Argo , you guys okay ? I am , but Moya is frelled . Anyone hear from Aeryn ? What about me ? No one asks about me ! Listen , Pilot 's not in too good a shape , is anybody nearby ? I 'm on my way ! I 'll meet you . So many different tongues , yet they communicate . Pip , you still there ? Tier 6 is a total loss ! A consortium . Sparky , go help her . Doesn 't simply shooting them dead strike you as viable ? Just , go ! DRD , Translator Microbes . They 've injected me with something ! Fight , while you have strength ! No ! No , no , no , no , no ... stop , please ! Just wait ... wait ... just My name is John Crichton . Can you understand me ? He ... speaks ... . and I comprehend ! They have altered your mind . I am Pathfinder Neeyala . Commanding Research Vessel Rado Slana . I don 't know what 's wrong . I don 't know what 's happening to us . All right , just calm down , Pilot , and tell us how you feel . Well I feel ... I had no idea that he could do that ! I had no idea anyone could do that ! I apologize ... colors ... lights ... sensations ... this region of space , I cannot function under the bombardments ! Can we isolate you from the stimuli ? ! Uhhh ... Neural clusters ... containment nexus circuitry ... Re-route it ? ! Dis ... Buffer the leads ? ! Dis ... What ? ! Disconnect ! Right ! We were regaining dimensionality when our ships collided , and must have been subjected to a massive burst of photonic distortion . Once the Phaztillin Generator is repaired , we 'll dose ourselves and hope your living ship doesn 't interfere with non-thermal dimensional forces . Do you understand any of those words ? Yeah , I watched all kinds of Star Trek . It 's just the order that they 're in . You said you studied wormholes . More trickery , Neeyala . Of course they would ... You can shut the frell up , I think . Because if you 're not going to take the Translator Microbes ... you don 't participate . Tell him that . You 've seen our research vessel . If we are to trust each other ... Yes . I 'll take him around our ship ... . Yes Come on . So , keep it simple . How do we get the ships apart ? Display . Wormholes , always gravitate toward each other in segmented loops . First jolts mean we 've exited one fragment of wormhole and then , quickly , into another . Only this gap ... is large enough to permit escape . And how often do we pass it ? Every third of an arn . Right . So , we 'll activate your phase ... Phaztillon . ... generator , and then we 'll separate . In theory . However , we 're not even sure how far into the turbulence zone this collision threw us . Say that again ? We 've ricocheted into the distorted region that divides a wormhole from normal space time . What ? Wha-it ? - uh . I mean ... we 're not even on the ... Fairway ! ... we 're in the Rough ? I didn 't mean to startle you . I am to die soon . The Goddess has chosen my harbinger . A magnificent planet lies just out there to ... rejuvenate and sustain you . A serpent lies between . You are ill ... hallucinations . My Stark ... my wonderful Stark . So afraid to let go . I have a darkness , which frightens lovers away . Whenever I assist the dying , I cannot help but absorb a tiny spillet of their existence . Over the cycles , the endless parade of death ... I 've accumulated a vast reservoir of evil . I cannot bear to lose the one thing that mitigates this twisted core of my existence . None of what you said makes any sense . I think he said we 're in the wall of the wormhole . Well , that 's kind of what she said . Look , we gotta wake Pilot up . He 's got to give us Starburst when we hit this particular gap . But can we do that while joined to another ship ? I 'm not sure , but they 're dead in the water , so Moya 's gotta pop us free . How do we get the ships separated ? Save that for later ... Colonel Klink , yo , inspection is over ... Aeryn , I need you to take Neeyala 's countdown . The rest of us are gonna seal the breeches before Starburst . I have the oxillary conduits . I 'll take the Hamman-side hatches on the way to Command ... move it ... now ... go ! I 'll go to Pilot 's ! I 'm close to the selticore vents ! And I 'll take the cargo bays . Well , I 'm going to need someone up here with another pair of hands . What can I do to help ? Two tiers down , four chambers across ... Moya 's external pressure sensors ... yank ' em all . I mean , what can I do about us ? That relationship does not exist . We could die . It exists for me . If you did not want to marry me , you could have found some other way to tell me . When I 'm cornered , I-I don 't think clearly . At least now you 're speaking the truth . External pressure sensors ? Yank ' em all . I 'm kind of in the mood to be destructive . What did you do ? ! I was checking the hangar . This started leaking . It regulates with self-venting ! I tried to close the valve , but it wouldn 't turn . Because ... it was already sealed ! Um-hm . Then I twisted it the other way . Rygel ! You opened it , opened it , opened it ! I 'll bet you 40 mesots she gurgles and dies before she can tell you where Earth is . Hey , Sleeping Beauty . Wake up and die . Who are you ? My name is John . Listen , we don 't have much time . Correct . Yours is up . Get ... ! Don 't touch me ! Do you know me ? My race ? Sebacean . Intellectually suited to carry weapons and die marching in formation . Human . Your species and mine might be related . Of course they are . I have a brother who 's a Stanerian Lizard . Have you ever heard of Earth ? On Trintika Major , the Predorian fly transmits a fatal Rheumatoid disease called , ' Arth' Ah , very similar . The animal speaks ? Whoa ... What 's your name ? Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hoovalis . What do they call you for short ? My whole name . Listen , Jool ... what 's the last thing you remember ? How long have I been in this chamber ? Manifest says 22 cycles . Whoa ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , Lady , dial it down ! ... we 're ready , Crichton ... . . prepare to Starburst , in ... five microts . Aeryn , I can 't hear a thing you 're sayin In ... 3 microts one It is time . Starburst Die later ... Starburst now ! Kill Starburst ! Kill Starburst ! Bad ? Is two of you bad ? That so depends . Well , it 's not bad enough . You should let Zhaan have a look at it . Zhaan does not have much respect for my head . You know , it 's okay to be in pain , D 'Argo . But , since you 're all right , I 'll get back to work . We 're gonna have to separate before we do anything . Suggestions ... Zhaan , you oughta hear this . Um , am I wrong , or is your 'Phaztillon ' generator , the key ? Ah , correct pronunciation , and correct . Can you repair the damage before we are all incapacitated ? The belief is so . However , circumstances , you will attest , are less than conducive . Pathfinder Neeyala . If your crew will not accept Translator Microbes , then I cannot communicate . If I cannot communicate , I cannot heal . Ah , we have rules against alien exposure . It is sufficient I have broken them . I understand ... but , under these extreme circu ... Pathfinder ! Pathfinder , help him , please ... his leg , we need help ! Tell her to follow me . My lab is the only place I might heal him . Besides my people healthy , I need empirical information about our position in the wormhole . Despite the danger , would you help ? Can you hear me ? ... Crichton . Stopping Starburst midway through took everything out of him . We need him to get the hangar doors open . Right now , he can 't even open his eyes . There 's not much else I can do , Crichton . Does this negate our plan ? No , it doesn 't . I can open the doors from Pilot 's console . ... May we ... have a moment ? Insane . Since birth . Suicidal . Test pilot . Do you trust her ? If we don 't do something , we 're gonna die . I 'm worried you 're a little too excited by all this . It 's wormholes . That 's what Scorpius wants . Scorpius is dead . That 's what you want . Aeryn , It can be a tool or a weapon . Let 's get there first . Let 's get there alive ... first . She doesn 't like you . Nah , it 's a phase . It 's part of her charm . Hm . I admit to some skepticism myself . This way . My module jams in wormholes . If this is ... some kind of ... jest ... Just give me the gizmo and tell me what to do . Without this data , our assumptions would be worse than . . than ... Flight times and vectors , that 's all I need . Crichton , is Neeyala with you ? Yes ... Blue . Please tell her I couldn 't save Cresto , I 'm sorry . I do appreciate the risk you take for us , and our families . We shall return that effort in selfless kind . Use this to record as much positional data inside the wormhole as you can . It 's no use . Even with the isolation D 'Argo 's providing , we 're travelling too fast for Pilot to cope . It 's all right . I know the hangar door configuration . Something wrong ? You 're very pretty . But I 'm not Zhaan , right ? Never be her . It 's all right , Stark . We 're going to get her out of here and we 're going to put her in the soil she needs to heal . Despite your fears , this must be accomplished . The generator 's leaking phasic resting ions . Lethal , Kreetago . I know what they are , Researcher . Expose yourself briefly as possible . Accomplish the task Pathfinder has laid out for you . May I interdict , Kreetago ? No . The knowledge this ship has amassed must be saved . Even if we die in the process . I can 't believe my cousins are dead . They didn 't suffer ... much . Animal ... how did they die ? Oh , if you must know ... we were at a surgical facility where you were all frozen . Crichton needed a brain storm , on ... how he could rescue you . We saved , uh ... two pods . One of my cousins survived ? Yeah ... for 30 microts . Then he oozed this-this black gunk . We don 't know how the other one died , do we Ryge ? What is it you 're not telling me ? Well , that we 're in a crisis , ' Hairdo ' , so you can either help , shut up , or go back to sleep . I won 't be spoken to like that by some ... . alley whore . How could she know that about you ? Did you know she had a fiancee ? Till she slept with his son ? Buckwheat , You , still want to get off this boat , man ? More than ever ! This creature sheds ... Good ! Cause your Uncle Sam needs you . We enter conventional space within 30 microts . Once clear , spiral hard , 71 degrees , vector briko . Roger . Copy that . Thanks for the intel . This is Farscape One ... ya 'll leave the light on for us . What 's happening ? It 's your basic ass-kickin ' wormhole , Ryge . How ya ' doin ' back there ? Lousy ! Excellent . Turn on that alien gizmo ... maximum power . Are we ... dead ? Oh , no Rygel , do you know what this is ? No The Holy Grail . The zone . We are in the effin ' zone , man . This is the dirty little secret of the universe . It all works if you know how to use it . Can these things take us ... home ? In a heartbeat . If you know where you 're going . D 'Argo ... D 'Argo , Pilot ... has been unconscious for over an arn now . Well , why didn 't you stop me earlier ! Well , somehow I have a feeling this isn 't about him anymore . I 'm sorry ... I 'm angry with myself because I can almost forgive her . Why don 't you . ow can I trust Chiana with my heart ? ... Can you trust Crichton again ? He trusts these aliens . We know nothing about them . I think wormholes blind him . Well , at least he has a hobby . Help me keep an eye on it . What the frell was that ? Zhaan told Stark she saw a serpent . She said that it was an omen for her . Did that look like it was aiming for Zhaan ? Wormhole ... Normal space ... Wormhole . Oh ... what are we doing here ? Making 17 loops to their 1 . Each time we lap ' em , it calibrates their position in the slower wall of the wormhole . Engrossing . Who cares ? It 's only collecting images , none of which mean anything ! Well , you gotta know how deep the doo-doo is , Ryge , if you 're gonna dig your way out . Next gap is the big one , right ? Yep Why don 't we just escape ? Does it ever bother you being selfish ? It 's ' self-preservation ' , and " No " What about our friends ? What friends ? We were thrown together against our will , and we 're all just trying to make the best of it until we can get the chance to screw the others and get what we want . I vote out at the next gap . Pa 'u Zotoh ... Hello , Pilot . Soon you must deploy the Docking Web , to rescue Crichton and Rygel . You are masterful with him . I am but a servant . This you will learn . I could never replace you . Stark , you must . For me , you must remain here and minister these souls . I 'm relying on it . But I love you . If I did not feel the same , and more , could I ask this sacrifice of you ? Zhaan , I need you to meet me in command . It must wait , Aeryn . We are about to deploy the Docking Web . No , your omen , the serpent . Is anyone else meant to see it ? And the big gap . Exit 's clearly marked . Normal space . Hey ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , keep your hands off those controls ! You have no right to make decisions for me ! We 're free ! Escape ! Save our lives ! Guido , we are goin ' back ! Son of a bitch . You ... broke my nose . You ain 't got a nose , Guido , you got slits . Oh ! Farscape One to Moya , positive contact with the Docking Web . Hey , nice catch , guys . I won 't forget this Crichton . I swear , you 've attacked me for the last time . You brought it on yourself , Rugrat . You delay my preparations for Crichton 's data . The serpent is harmless . Less than convincing . Try again . I never imagined you 'd encounter this beast . Otherwise I would have issued warning . You must believe me . How can we , Neeyala ? Look at what you 've done to our ship . What I have done ? ! It is you who have destroyed my life 's endeavor . Whilst I have suffered your probing , your confusions , and your smell . Do you not think that my bristles contain enough poison to dispatch you all ? Yet , when I fail to overload what are clearly inferior intellects with a drist of needless information ... you ... bring weapons to bear ! Kill me if you will . See how you fare on your own . Do you feel better ? Now , about the serpent ... The creature you have seen , exists exclusively inside wormholes . Corporeal only when the generator shifts are phase present . Which one would have to do to repair it . I doubt it even senses us . Be less alarmed . Shut up ! Would you shut up ? ! What happened ? Something really wierd ... and-and I tried to shoot it when ... Shut up ! Neeyala said the serpent doesn 't even know we 're here . I thought you were with Pilot ? I thought you were in the Neural Cluster . Filtration 's down on Tier 1 . You can 't even breathe in there . Junction 's are frying everywhere . Pilot can 't stop it . Well , you had better tell that four-armed , bug eyed , whiney little Slijot to get his dren together ! It 's not him . The stresses on Moya are frying Junctions everywhere ! She 's dying D 'Argo . The wormhole is killing her . Do you hope , someday , to be Dominar , Rygel ? I am still Dominar ! Always Dominar ! I mean ruling from a throne , instead of a throne sled . They 'll never know if I kill Crichton . But you will ... Fool the others , if you like . But I see the larger goodness in a small Hynerian . Separating this allien ship from Moya must be your first priority Rygel . Have I ever told you that I appreciate your counsel ? Continously , by accepting it . It 's amazing the number of species picked up by Neeyala 's gizmo . Thousands of cultures spread out across the galaxy . I resent you calling me here at a whim . That 's the way it works , Harvey . You don 't like it , I can toss you back in the dumpster . Do you think Scorpy 's still alive ? Do you think Scorpius is still alive ? Without doubt . What 's he doing with the information he stole from my brain ? The knowledge placed there by the Ancients , is by now , centerpiece of a sprawling new research facility If he masters wormhole technology , what will he use it for ? Faster delivery of pizzas . Neeyala ... think 's it 's possible we can separate the ships . But only one will survive . We have to pick which one . Yes , it 's a shame about Moya . She 'll be fondly remembered . It 's not a done deal . Did you call me here ... to talk you out of your guilt ? No It 's just ... the information amassed inside their ship ... No contest ! I sit here inside your feeble brain , listening to the arguments bounce off the hollow spaces ! How could you not choose science over a beast of burden ! You disgust me , John ! I long for the dumpster . Pilot and Moya are to die , John . Take the wormhole knowledge that 's fallen in your lap and call it day ! I cannot believe ... - what I am hearing ... - Facts , D 'Argo , that 's all ... How is this even a choice ? Because some of us want to live ! If we use Starburst to pu ... What ? You-you didn 't get slammed against the wall hard enough the last time ? So we recover the data from the precious ship , and leave in Moya Our craft itself , is the knowledge based-repository . The ship is one giant computer chip . It 's all or nothing . Then nothing . We will never abandon Moya while I am still alive . Frelling martyr . Why not separate in one of these gaps ? We need the density of the wormhole wall to help pull us apart . Do you have only one good ear also ? I 'm not dying just because a ship can eat and crap . Okay ... So , we separate . What then ? One vessel slides into the wormhole core , maintaining a chance of enduring . The other , tumbles uncontrolled through the wormhole wall into normal space ... to be atomized by differentials in speed and density . It is still not a choice . Moya and Pilot are living beings , they must be afforded every opportunity . Zhaan , The biomechanoid parts on my ship were fried . Calculations indicate that your Leviathan 's design will work against her survival . Forgive me , Pathfinder Neeyala , but I do not count you as unbiased . Hah ! Like you are . You know what you and Pilot have in common besides big eyes ? You 're both dying , and now you want to take us with you . Can it , F. Lee . Zhaan , Pilot is unconscious . Moya 's nexus system is so backed up the Roto-Rooter man couldn 't get it I know the litany , John . How desperate you must be for this wormhole knowledge . Unfair . You place your obsession above the lives of your friends . What ? ! What have these strangers done to so earn your trust ? We must check the back-up systems . I need to know that Pilot and Moya are truely beyond hope . Let 's go . You want to know what really happened to your cousin ? What Crichton won 't tell you ? How you feelin ' ? You missed the debate . Th-that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . I feel guilty . What possibily for ? I love Pilot , and I ... love Moya ... but , I don 't want to die here . There is nothing wrong with a decision of the heart , child . In the time that is left , use your mind to satisfy your soul that it is correct . Hey , how 'd you go ? Ah , well , if it wasn 't Moya , we wouldn 't be having this conversation . Yeah , it 's the same everywhere . Total meltdown . I 'm going to take a run through the ion-backwash chamber , see if there 's anything I can do . Hey , you all right ? No . What the hell are you doin ' ? And what happened to your hair ? It 's red . You 're not planning to ... Yes What the hell are you tryin ' to do ? ! You lied to me . You butchered my cousin 's brain so you could steal a wellot of his neural fluid ? A member of the intellectual elite . 16 advanced degrees . Traded ... for the likes of you ? Cut it out , lady . If we 're to perish , then at least you 'll die first . I thought you were good with women . I am . Did you see what happened when she fired at the ship ? Actually , no . I was looking at the pulse rifle . There 's a small gap in the force-field , which unsurprisingly , is the key to it 's access Now , John ... We 're trapped in this ... vawn of a wormhole , Pilot 's unconscious , Moya is dying ... and my son has slept with my betrothed . Lock ... this woman ... up . Entreaties , Pathfinder . I do not enjoy sending you to your death , youngling . But , options are depleted . I want to live . More important , do you want your family do live ? You know what happens to ours should this ship fail to return . Will you tell them ? That you thought of them , to the end . Attention now , Shreena . Time is limited . These creatures ... I will distract them . They must not know your true mission . Frell ! I checked this panel , and it was fine . But before I had a chance to close it , it shorted out . There are dozens more just like this on this tier . Then why are we standing here ? That hatch could blow ! He 's right . Functioning DRD 's are overmatched . There 's no way we can repair all the damage . Let us not forsake our friends until we are ... undeniably clear that ... Well , that settles it , then . We will go with Neeyala , and we will abandon Moya . I have failed my purpose , Stark . You protect , heal , give hope . This ship and her Pilot are to die . As do all things . Once out of the wormhole , you will heal in the soil of a fertile planet . And one day , your gifts will again help others . I cannot take you back , Chiana . But I won 't leave you alone in pain . Have you ... ever been responsible for another 's death , Officer Sun ? Yes , I have . This is my first time . Did you know your crew well ? Enough to steel my determination . On their memory , I will not fail . Pilot , you should see all these cultures , that you could touch with one wormhole . Man , I wish you were goin ' with us Hey , Pilot . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Could 'a , would 'a , should 'a . Aeryn ! Hey !

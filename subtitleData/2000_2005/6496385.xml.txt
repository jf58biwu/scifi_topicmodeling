 It 's freezing out there . You weren 't gone long . Did you do what I asked ? Yes . It 's important , Gary . Promise me you did it . You 're sick , Dad . You should be in a hospital not stuck out here in the middle of nowhere . You don 't owe this guy Stites anything . It 's not about owing . I freeze my butt off checking and rechecking the locks every night . For what ? You don 't need to know . Yeah , that 's for sure . I 'm going to flix some dinner . Oh , Lord . Gary , you didn 't ... Oh , whew . Oh , God . Dad ? Agent Scully . Mmm . Can I take your coat ? I 'm not staying , Agent Doggett . My doctor told me to take my maternity leave . In fact , she insisted on it . That 's not bad , Agent Scully . You could use some time for yourself . What is it ? It 's a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight . I 'd like to give this to you , Agent Doggett . Thanks . Because ? Agent Mulder gave it to me a few years back . It symbolizes teamwork ... partnership . It means no one gets there alone . And after this past year and ... everything that we 've been through , I just ... I wouldn 't be here without you . Agent Scully . This pregnancy leave ... it 's just a \ x22leave , \ x22 right ? I mean ... you are coming back eventually ? You 're not gone fiive minutes , Agent Scully and already I 'm starting to feel like a stranger in my own off ... I 'm sorry ? Can I help you ? I 'm here to help you , actually . I 'm Leyla Harrison . I 've been looking forward to meeting you . Uh-huh . I 've got a case here , an X-File , I think . At least the local PD can 't explain it . A murder last night in upstate New York . I booked us on a flight to Buffalo Niagara . Here 's the crime report . I 'm sorry , Ms. Harrison ... who are you ? Oh , gosh . They didn 't tell you ? This is ... so embarrassing . Uh , I 'm ... I 'm your new partner . I asked that the body be sent to D.C. It was found in the woods about 50 yards beyond the house . Maybe we should begin there . Let 's begin inside the house . Okay , then . The deceased is Arlen Sacks , aged 72 caretaker for the estate on which this house is situated . There were no signs of physical trauma but local PD suspect homicide due to the dumping of the body . Mr. Sacks was confiined to a wheelchair the last few months cared for since then by his son , Gary who 's their chief suspect . Why ? Um ... oh , because he 's missing , too . If he killed this man without leaving a mark that would suggest premeditation an attempt to disguise the murder . But that doesn 't fiit with dumping the body in the woods or fleeing the scene both of which indicate panic , haste . That is great . What was that last part again , about the premeditation ? What is that ? Slime ? There 's a small streak of it on the floor over there , too . So , it 's not someone ; it 's something . God , this really is an X-File , isn 't it ? Congratulations . I gave the slime to the Buffalo PD . I told them we wanted to see the results right away . How much fileid experience you have , Agent Harrison ? Um , actually , this is my fiirst time in the fileid . Let me guess ... Deputy Director Kersh handed you this job fiilling in for Agent Scully . Yes . Yes , he did . I don 't know how to tell you this , Agent Harrison but you 're being used . Deputy Director Kersh is no friend to the X-Files . I don 't think you understand something , Agent Doggett . I begged for this assignment . You begged for it . I was in Accounting . I processed Agents Mulder and Scully 's travel expenses . Then you are qualifiied . Maybe I 'm not but I know the X-Files , Agent Doggett , inside and out . Other people don 't even want to admit these questions exist but you face them every day . I am just so excited to be a part of this . Aren 't you ? Mr. Sack 's body was found here but they found no footprints leading to it . Oh , my God . There 's more of it . Looks like it . You know what that could be ? It could be bile . Bile ? From a liver-eating mutant . Mulder and Scully chased one into an escalator once . It died , but , but there was ... This is not a liver-eating mutant , Agent Harrison . It could be an alien who shed its skin . According to Agent Mulder 's case reports they leave behind a mucous-like residue when they , uh ... You don 't think it 's that either . I 'll take a sample of this . Have it sent to the lab for comparison . That 's good thinking , Agent Harrison . Hey . Ready to roll ? Yeah . I 'lljust get my keys . Hey . Don 't forget this . Relax the back . Breathe in , breathe out . How do you know all these things , Mulder ? I 'm unemployed . I got a lot of time on my hands . Oprah . I watch a lot of Oprah . Thank you for doing this with me . What 's the matter ? I don 't know . I , uh ... Maybe it 's hormones or ... This is just ... I 'm just feeling so strange about all this . This having a baby , this ? No ... no . Leaving work , I guess . I mean , I ... I walked out of that offiice today feeling like a deserter . You 've paid your dues there , Scully . More than paid them . You 're concerned about Agent Doggett . You know the entire time that I was down there I had someone to watch my back . I 'm betting that Agent Doggett can take care of himself . He 's a big boy . You 've got to worry about the little boy or little girl . Boy ? Or girl ? Whoa . Agent Harrison , what are you doing here ? I followed the tr ... It 's here . It ? What " it \ x22 ? You 're armed , right ? What do you want me to do ? I want you to go outside and I want you to stand by the front door . What ever it is , I 'm going to try and flush it out . Agent Harrison . Take the safety off . Harrison . Agent Harrison ! Skinner . Is it true ? Agent Scully . I can 't reach Agent Doggett and someone told me he 's gone missing . He was investigating a murder . He hasn 't reported back . Why wasn 't I told ? Agent Scully , don 't worry . I 'm heading into the Bureau right now . No , you 're not . Sir , are you ordering me not to go looking for Agent Doggett ? I 've got every available law-enforcement offiicer out here . You 're on maternity leave now . Just trust that we 're doing everything that we know to do . I know that you are ... but what if it 's not enough ? - I 'll just take this to the lab . - Thank you . Seems like old times . You in scrubs , slicing and dicing . What are you doing here , Mulder ? Actually I-I wandered away from my tour . A better question is , what are you doing here ? I found something that may prove helpful in locating Agent Doggett . This is Arlen Sacks the murder victim Doggett was investigating . This old man was not murdered , Mulder . He died of heart failure , evidently after he was blinded by a chemical substance of some kind . The orbits have ... residual traces of a slimy substance ... known as hydrolytic enzymes . Venom . Produced by reptiles . How 'd you know that ? Before Agent Doggett and his partner went missing , they sent in samples to be analyzed . Hydrolytic enzymes . Skinner told me . I , uh , also found some bacteria in the venom which I 'm going to do a culture on . Let somebody else do it . There are other concerns right now . I know , but this is an X-File , Mulder and you are out of the Bureau , and now if I go home where is Skinner going to fiind someone qualifiied to look into this ? I know where he could fiind somebody . Agent Doggett ? I 'm right here . Are you all right ? It sprayed my eyes with something . My vision 's all blurry . Makes two of us . Three , actually . I think it 's Gary Sacks , the son of the murder victim . How 'd you get down here ? I think it dragged me down here . I 'm not sure . So what do we do now ? I don 't know . Mulder and Scully investigated a case once in Florida . It involved subterranean men who took people underground . This is not a man . I fell through some kind of trap . I 'm guessing somebody put that there to provide live meals for this thing . You 're not saying that includes us ? I don 't intend to wait around and fiind out . These tunnels were built by bootleggers back in Prohibition . There 's got to be one that leads back to the house . Something up there , I think . Some kind of light . I can 't tell how high up that is . Mulder , you 're not supposed to be out here . I 'm not out here . What happened to the search ? Police in West Seneca found Doggett 's car parked at a convenience store about a half hour from here . How 'd it get there ? I don 't know , but we 're redirecting our search . Where are you going ? I think I 'll take a walk in the woods . We 've already had 40 people looking around out there , Mulder . What the hell ? I 'm out of a job already , right ? Thought all you people left . You are ? Herman Stites . I own this property . You 're just the man I wanted to speak to , Mr. Stites . Have you seen anything unusual around here ? Unusual ? How ? Dangerous animals ... reptiles . I 'm confused . I thought the police were looking for a man . Arlen 's son , Gary . That is what they 're looking for . Agent Doggett ? I 'm all right . I don 't think Gary Sacks committed this murder , Mr. Stites . I think he may be a victim himself . I didn 't catch your name , Agent . Kersh , Alvin Kersh . I 'm a scientist , Mr. Kersh . What kind of a scientist are you ? A biologist so I know something about animals . They don 't generally carry men off into the woods like poor Mr. Sacks . I don 't think this was an animal . I think it was a man using some kind of reptile venom to blind them fiirst . That would be quite a trick . You 'd really have to know what you were doing . You 'd have to be , say , a scientist . Are you accusing me of something , Mr. Kersh ? No . I 'm just thinking out loud , Mr. Stites . I need a hand . Agent Doggett , what happened ? I lost my grip with a little help from the man upstairs . Hey ! Hey ! I 'm a federal agent ! I don 't understand . Why would he want to keep us down here ? You wanted to face the unknown , Agent Harrison . Well , you 're facing it now . But who is he ? Some kind of scientist , I think . I saw some books and papers on biology in his library . It could be some kind of symbiotic relationship between this man and this creature . Mulder and Scully ... Mulder and Scully aren 't here , Agent Harrison , we are . And wild speculation isn 't going to help us find a way out . You think I 'm pretty foolish , don 't you ? I appreciate your enthusiasm , but you want to take leaps that aren 't supported by the facts . What I want you to do is stay with that guy right there while I look for another way out . If this thing comes near you ... I want you to shoot . Agent Doggett . He 's gone . What do you mean he 's gone ? I don 't know . It must have taken him . Mulder . Mulder , what are you doing ? I 'm spitting sunflower shells on Herman Stites 's driveway . What are you doing , Scully ? I just got off the phone with Skinner who is furious . This man Stites just called him saying that you 've been impersonating Deputy Director Kersh and making baseless accusations . What 's he mad about me impersonating Kersh or me harassing Stites ? Mulder , the victim had reptile venom in his eyes . Are you now saying that it was a man who did this ? What are you saying it is , Scully ? I know this may be hard to believe coming from me but some kind of reptile attack is the only explanation consistent with the scientifiic evidence . I don 't think it 's a monster that we 're dealing with here . I think it is a man . And why do you say that ? You regifted . I 'm sorry ? My Apollo medallion . You found it ? Yeah . I found it on the grass on Stites 's estate . Doggett must be around here somewhere . Agent Scully ? I got to go . What am I looking at ? As you asked we cultured the bacteria from the hydrolytic enzymes that were sprayed into the old man 's eyes . Looks like they 're breaking down the tissue . That 's exactly what they 're doing . The venom blinds its victim , then the bacteria excretes protease and collagenase throughout the victim 's body . Digestive enzymes . Muscle , bone , all of it is slowly liquefiied for easy digestion while the victim 's skin is made hard and brittle forming a sack or shell from which the reptile can drink . So the reptile sprays its victim and then all it has to do is wait . There are precedents for this sort of thing in nature . Yeah , but there are no species that can do all of this . At least not yet . What do you mean ? Talk about the blind leading the blind . I owe you an apology , Agent Doggett . You 're doing fline , Agent Harrison . Hang tough . You were right . I 'm not qualifiied . We 're going to fiind a way out of here , Agent Harrison . I don 't think I am . Why , what is it ? Whatever happened to Sacks ... I think it 's happening to me . I 'm completely blind now . Oh , God , Agent Doggett ! I think it 's Gary Sacks . Mulder . You were right about Herman Stites , Mulder . What 'd you fiind ? Stites is a crypto-biologist specializing in reptile genetics . Listen to this : It says here that he published a monograph last year claiming to be on the verge of creating a new species of reptile . You don 't think he succeeded , do you ? I don 't know . He dropped out of sight and never published a follow-up . But , Mulder , the bacteria inside this venom ... if Stites is genetically altering reptile breeds it may explain the peculiar properties . Mulder , are you listening to me ? Mulder ? Mulder ? I think Mr. Stites might have a lot more than that to explain . Mulder ? Mulder ? Mr. Stites ! Mr. Stites , open up ! Mr. Stites , open the door ! Mr. Stites ! Mr. Stites ! Mr. Stites ! What do you want ? Where is it , Mr. Stites ? This thing you 're protecting ... this creature of yours ? I don 't think you meant for it to but it got out last night and attacked the caretaker and his son and then it attacked my colleagues . Now , I can have 50 men in here to comb this place within the hour . Where are they , Mr. Stites ? It 's all right . It 's just me . Doesn 't make any damn sense . There 's no exit except that door . Maybe it does . Agent Doggett ? Right here ! It 's all right , Agent Doggett . We 're going to get you out of here . Who 's that with you ? It 's the man that lives here . He 's been protecting this thing . He 's kept us down here . - Agent Doggett , I know ... - It 's him . He 's not protecting it . He is it . Agent Mulder ? Agent Doggett , I don 't have a weapon . I 'm coming to get yours . No , I 'm not . Mulder , I can 't see . Mulder , where is it ? It 's right above you . It 's coming this way . Where , Mulder ? I can 't see ! Aim down . Aim at the sound of my voice . No , I 'll shoot you ! You 're not going to shoot me . I can 't see ! Aim at the sound of my voice . Where is it ? Aim at me ! Fire when I tell you to fiire . No ! Fire ! Agent Mulder ? Agent Mulder ? I 'm right here . I 'm right here , Agent Doggett . Agent Doggett ? Is this it ? - No . - No . We just came by to visit Agent Harrison . How is she ? She 's on the same antivenin treatment I got . Her eyesight 's pretty much back . Doctors say she 's going to be fline , physically . Skinner said she won 't be returning to the X-Files . That was her choice . Just going to be me for a while . I want to return something to you that I think you deserve to keep . I appreciate the gesture but if it 's all the same to you there 's someone else who should have it . No way . This means ... I can 't tell you what this means to me . Can I ask you something ? Sure . When you went to Antarctica to save Agent Scully from being taken by that spaceship and you ran out of gas in your Snow-Cat ... how did you get back ? Um , well , fiirst of all it was never actually proven that it was a spaceship . It wasn 't ? No , what happened was that we fell off of something that rose out of the ice . And what do you think that was ? Well , I don 't know what it was but we didn 't actually see a spaceship . I can 't believe you 're saying it 's not a spaceship . It could have been a spaceship . Of course it was a spaceship . We don 't know that it ... But you don 't have a picture of it or anything . You know it was a spaceship . You saw it . No , no , remember , I was unconscious . And when I woke up there was no spaceship . Mulder , no , no , no . And you were frozen . And remember , I hugged you until you were not frozen anymore ...

 GIRL ( ALLIE ) : My mother always talked to me a lot about the sky . She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night ... especially the stars . We would play a game sometimes . a game called " What 's Beyond the Sky ? " We would imagine darkness or a blinding light or something else that we didn 't know how to name . But. of course . that was just a game . There 's nothing beyond the sky . The sky just is. and it goes on and on . and we play all of our games beneath it . Comin ' in. twelve o 'clock high ! Tail gunner. get the bogey ! Gunners ... give ' em short bursts when they 're in range . Do not waste ammunition . Watch out ! Bandit , twelve o 'clock . Watch out , they 'll come back around . There 's one ! There 's one ! - That was too close ! - Roger that ! Nine o 'clock ! He 's comin ' around . I 'm on him ! Come on. you lousy Kraut ! Come to papa ! Yeah ! Whoo ! I got him ! Nine o 'clock . keep your eyes open ! There 's another one ! Whoo-hoo ! Captain ! What do you got , Toland ? Lights ... blue ones . - We see them. too ! - Holy Mary ! - What the hell are they ? - Let 's get a look at these . - Are they Germans ? - They 're too bright . I can 't see ! Three bogeys. moving fast ! Everybody keep calm . We 're gonna take care of this . - Bandit. twelve o 'clock ! - F - 1s coming down on our left . Head right. full throttle ! - I 'm hit ! - Oh , Christ ! Russ ! - We 're losing altitude ! - We 're losing engines ! Co-pilot. take the plane ! - Co-pilot , take the plane ! - Yes , sir ! Captain Keys is on fire ! Cover his tail ! You hang on . Russ ! We 're gettin ' out of here ! - We lost an engine ! - Shut it down ! They 're comin ' back ! Christ. all around us ! Keys is going down ! She 's breakin ' up ! We 're goin ' down ! Get a parachute ! We gotta get out of here ! Let 's go. guys ! We 've gotta bail out now ! Captain , we 've got to bail out ! I don 't want to die ! Trust me , Johnson ... we won 't die . ALLIE : Russell Keys came home from the war like a lot of other soldiers . He was tired of fighting . and he was very glad to be coming home . There were things that had happened to him . and he knew that he was not the same person he had been when he left . He had changed . and he wondered about all the things here at home that might have changed. too . while he 'd been away . But sometimes when you go somewhere far away and then come back . the part that bothers you most is not the things that have changed . but the way that other things have stayed the same . like you hadn 't been anywhere or done anything at all . Hello , Mum . The kids would still play ball on the vacant lot where he and his friends had played every summer . The high-school band would still play every Friday night in the park downtown . and old Mrs Parker would still be waiting . as the kids came home from school . to yell at them if they stepped on her flowers . All of that might still be the same . but he was different . and so nothing would really be the same at all . - I know you will . - Miss ? Who do I talk to about getting one of those G.I. loans ? I remember the day I proposed to your mother . I was nervous as hell . I can 't picture anything making you nervous . I had to walk around the block five times , and then I walked halfway home after that before I finally managed to get my nerve up . Of course , I hadn 't had the life experience that you 've had . - Dad . - Hmm ? My car looked real nice . Well , we hid her from a couple of scrap drives . Kind of unpatriotic , I guess , but we did our bit in other ways . Was it very terrible ? Nah , it wasn 't so bad . RUSSELL : What do you got . Toland ? Lights ! Blue ones ! What the hell are they ? ! ( machine-gun fire ) JOHNSON : Captain. we 've got to bail out ! I don 't want to die ! Trust me . Johnson ... we won 't die . ALLIE : They say some men carry their war with them for the rest of their lives . and some men put it behind them like an old pair of shoes . And then . I guess. there are others who go on fighting . even if they have no idea who their fight is with or why it 's so important not to give up . MAN : Some people will tell you the war was won by superior manpower . Some people say that it was strategy or a just cause or the fact that we 're so damn tough . None of that is true . What won the war was secrets ... knowing theirs and keeping ours . Gentlemen , meet the Enola Gay . When the Enola Gay dropped her payload on Hiroshima , only 1 07 men in the entire country knew what that specific payload was . The B-29 had been redesigned to carry its load , and a new crew , selected to carry an atomic bomb , was onboard . They were carrying out a mission so secret that even they didn 't know what it was . The secret was kept until the ultimate moment . As a result , the war was won . As members of the Intelligence Corps , it will be your job to keep secrets . Here at the 509th Bomb Group , that responsibility is made all the more awesome by the fact that we are the only base authorized to store atomic weapons . At any given moment , your ability to keep your mouth shut and , if necessary , to lie through your teeth may very well determine the course of history . Group , ten-hut ! We had 1 8 more sightings today . Dancing lights , mostly . The bulk of them over the Pacific Northwest and three , I think , over the Great Lakes . Something Russian ? I heard something on the radio . People were saying that they 're from another planet . We used to hear that a lot at Los Alamos . We never knew if it was something of ours or something the Germans had going . That 's right , Owen , I forgot . You were at Los Alamos . We got a new mare in at the stables . I thought you might like to join me for a ride . - I 'd like that very much . - Fine . Will you be joining us ? No . She doesn 't ride . Her constitution ... it 's a little too delicate . He 's a bit of a bully , your father . It 's not personal . He just--he 's like that . Captain , are you gonna ride or stand around yapping ' ? If he doesn 't let you ride , how does he feel about you going to the movies ? Man named Kenneth Arnold- - private pilot out of Boise flying over the Cascades- - says he saw nine saucer-shaped disks in the sky . This is all over the Seattle papers . Wire services picked it up , and they 're running with it . " And they 're running with it , sir . " You don 't want to forget about the " sir . " Some officers around here that can really get their shorts in a bunch over that , Howard . Just something to keep in mind . What do you make of all this ? Russians . Some sort of reconnaissance coming over the Bering Strait . It has to be . You don 't think we 're being invaded by Martians , then ? No ... sir . I don 't . - WOMAN : I did . - MAN : I thought it was swell . ( thunder ) WOMAN : Hey there , soldier . You looking for some fun ? Not now , Sue . I 'm on duty . You look ready for action , but you don 't look like you 're on duty . I 'm meeting the colonel to go over something . Sure you are . Call you later ? I won 't be there . MAN : Welcome back to KGFL studios in Roswell . New Mexico . It 's a breezy July 2 . 1 947 . and here is Dinah Washington with Stairway T o The Stars . # Let 's build a stairway to the stars # # And climb that stairway to the stars # # With love beside us # # To fill the night with song # MAN : ... second season as manager ... ( changing channels ) ( static ) Great . ( engine sputtering ) ( sputtering ) Damn it ! ( radio plays ) Hello ? Hello ! Is anybody out here ? ! ( gasps ) Aah ! - ( rustling ) - ( gasps ) We believe that what we saw was God 's angels dancing . That , or some new airplane from White Sands gone out of control . You mentioned that you saw a crash . Clear as day . If that was God 's angels , then right now , they 're camped out about a mile and a half above Pine Lodge . ( knock on door ) OWEN : Yes ? Excuse me for interrupting , sir . There 's a rancher just came into the sheriff 's office with something I think you ought to take a look at . Sue . I 'm right in the middle of something . I really need to see you . And I need to see you . How about if I give you a call tonight if I can get away ? I want every bit of debris out of this pasture and back at the base . All of your men are confined to the base pending a debriefing . And that means the two of you . - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . - Any witnesses ? - Yes , sir . His name 's Brazel . Sir , we 'd appreciate your not speaking to anyone about this . It 's a matter of national security . It 's from outer space , isn 't it ? What crashed in that field was a constant-level balloon train . And this is the material out of which the radar reflectors on the train are made . If the Russians have figured out how to build a bomb , we want to know about it , and this little spy balloon will tell us . This is a project called " Mogul " and has a security classification of A-1 . Reporters are all over this . We 're gonna have to give them something . Somebody already has . MAN : With us this morning in the KGFL studios is a local rancher who has a startling story to tell . You found something on your ranch . some kind of debris ? RANCHER : This wasn 't just any debris. sir . This was some metal like nothing I 'd ever seen before . This was something from another world . We 've got to shut this guy up , sir . We thought we 'd let it go , divert attention from Mogul . You 've seen the reports on all these sightings . People are eating this up with a spoon . I wouldn 't recommend that , sir . Why is that , Captain ? If we give our seal of approval to this , people are gonna believe it . You get a country that thinks we 're not in control of the skies , you 're inviting a major panic . Oh , really ? Which do you like better for the press release- - " Flying disks " or " Flying saucers " ? Is this for real , Captain ? Those were pieces of a spaceship ? No , it was ours . Spy balloon , highly classified , A-1 . That weird metal , all of that- - Part of the project . Some flying saucer , eh , sir ? This highly classified project collided with something , that 's how it crashed ? I suppose so , yes . So what did it collide with ? The advantage comes through preparation . By the time your troop goes out for its wilderness badge , you guys are gonna know every inch of this ground . Isn 't that kind of like cheating ? Scouting is about attitude . You 're gonna have to do something about yours . We 've done this weekend 14 times , Dad . Don 't you think we 're ready ? You 're ready when you know- - when you absolutely know your ground , okay ? When you can be sure that nothing can surprise you . Oh , my God . RADIO : Jackie Robinson continues to extend his consecutive game hitting streak to 1 9 . While Robinson will no doubt remain the centre of attention in the National League . he 's about to share the spotlight with Larry Doby . another Negro who ... Once you let them in , there 's no turning back . It 's the end of the world as we know it . What do you guys make of all this flying-saucer razzmatazz ? I think the Russians was giving us a buzz with some spy gadget , see what all we got out at the base . The hell with that . It was ours . We were testing something to spy on them . Or maybe the Germans . I say it was the Martians , pure and simple . The captain ! Owen , I need to speak to you . Sue , uh ... Um , you know what ? Couple of minutes . - Marty . - Yes , sir . That woman I just nodded to- - give me a couple of minutes , then go tell her I was called away on an emergency and I won 't be back today . And , Marty , she 's gonna know you 're lying , so try to sound as sincere as possible . Yes , sir . MARTY : Excuse me , Miss . I 'm sorry , but the captain 's been called away . You 're welcome to wait , but he may not be back for a while . Excuse me . Are you the people we talk to about flying saucers ? There 's someone who can help you down the hall . My boys and I have some information . Down the hall . BOY : But we know where one crashed . I was out with the boys , doing a little practice for their wilderness outing- - BOY : Which we think is kind of cheating . Knowing as much as possible beforehand is not cheating . - It 's being prepared . - Thank you , Captain . We were just coming up over this rise . It 's a real one , isn 't it , sir ? Most people change kind of slowly . They 're who they are . and then after a while . they 're someone else . But some people know the exact moment where their lives changed . They saw the person they were going to marry or the look in their baby 's eyes the first time he smiled . For some people . it 's not the good things in life that made them change . It 's something they 've gone through that makes everything they look at from that moment on seem very different from how it had always been . Beautiful boy you got there , Russell . Yeah , he takes after his mum . Yeah , he does . You 've got the life , I 'm telling you . You 've got the best girl in Bement , a beautiful boy , you got your memories of your heroic youth . Yeah , I 've got it all . Russell , if I was you , I 'd be the happiest man in town . I wouldn 't be looking like something the cat dragged in . Bill , I 'm all right . I just have , uh ... trouble sleeping , that 's all . BOY : Come on , stop ! ( laughing ) Hey ! - Get off of him ! Let him go ! - Go ... go , go ! # . For they 'll never know what love can do # . # . To each his own . I found my own # . # . One and only ... you # . ( baby coos ) - I 'm sorry . - It 's all right . It 's all right . I get these pictures in my head ... and I can 't concentrate on anything . Pictures in your head ... from the war ? I was shot in the gut , Kate ... And I was dying ... and my plane was going down . And three days later , I was in a field in France with all of my men ... With no idea where we 'd been for those three days or how we 'd gotten to that field ... Or why weren 't we dead . What did your men say ? We never talked about it . Something happened to me . I don 't know what . I just have this feeling it 's still happening . Jetzt bist du mein gefangener . RUSSELL : Aah ! Get away from me ! It was a dream ! Get away from me ! It was a dream . You 're all right , honey . You 're here with me . It was a dream . It was a dream . A dream . A dream . It was a dream . ( panting ) You 're all right , sweetie . You 're all right . It wasn 't a dream . For God 's sakes , Russell , how are we gonna get out ? It doesn 't matter . As long as they can 't get in . Who ? As long as who can 't get in ? You don 't want to know . Russell ! Russell ! - Look at me ! - No ! No ! What 's happening to you ? You 're gonna let them give this to the press , too ? Well , it was one thing when we knew it was a lie . We can control that . But now that it 's real , there 's no way we can let this out . Who found it ? A father and his sons out hiking . Did you clean that up ? I already have . That 's good . Son ... I appreciate your coming to me with this , and when the time comes , you won 't be forgotten . Sir , when I went inside the craft , there were- - there were five seats . There are only four bodies . Canvass everything within a 200-mile radius of the crash site . If something crawled out of here alive , I want to know about it . People are lonely in this world for lots of different reasons . Some people have something in their disposition . Maybe they were just born too mean . or maybe they were born too tender . But most people are brought to where they are by circumstance . by calamity or a broken heart or something else happening in their lives that wasn 't anything they planned on . What the hell 's wrong with my chicken ? I don 't think it was your chicken , Tyler . ( sighs ) You can go on home , Sally . I 'll take care of these stragglers and lock up . 'Lessen , of course , you want to call Fred and tell him you 're leaving him and the kids for me . Well , maybe I best go home and tell him in person , Tyler . He ain 't good enough for you , Sal . People are lonely in this world for lots of different reasons . The one thing that I do know is . it doesn 't matter what any one of them might tell you- - nobody wants to be alone . - Shoehorn ? - What ? The shoehorn- - have you seen it ? You have to leave tonight ? I 'm in San Antonio tomorrow afternoon selling to an insurance company . Those guys can smell road sweat on a person . They don 't respond well to road sweat . Did the kids eat ? You want me to feed the kids ? You 're the waitress , you feed ' em . I gotta go . I 'll see you in three weeks . If something comes up , call the home office . They know where I am . ( racket in distance ) ( rustling ) ( thunder ) MAN : Please help me . Stay right here for just a second . Tom , honey . Wake up , sweetie . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I need you to go sleep on the couch , okay ? Who 's that ? We 'll talk about it in the morning . Go get the pillow and the extra blanket from my bed . Come on , sweetie , go on . Go on . You really should see a doctor . I 'll be fine as soon as I can collect my thoughts . Thank you . Thank you for bringing me in . Good night . Who is he ? Who 's that man ? He 's a stranger , honey , and he 's hurt . How long does he have to stay in my room ? I don 't know . I guess until he 's better . Mama , what happened to your nose ? Some people have given up all hope of anything in their lives ever changing . They just go on with it day by day . and if something were to come along and make things different . they probably wouldn 't even notice it right off . except maybe for that kind of nervous feeling you get in your stomach . My mom and I used to call that " the car trip feeling . " because it was how I 'd feel whenever I knew we were going to go somewhere far away or somewhere new . How you feeling ? I 'm much better . What 's this ? Breakfast . Thank you . Maybe in a few minutes . The bathroom 's right down the hall . I put out some towels and shirt and pants that belonged to my husband before he gained weight . I reckon you can keep ' em . That 's very kind . Your husband doesn 't appreciate that kindness in you . He doesn 't see your sadness , either . But you 've stopped wanting him to . I think you 're right . There 's some things you don 't share with an uncaring person . What happened to you ? I was in an accident . I can see that . What kind of accident ? Farming . You got a farm around here ? No , I ... Someone gave me a ride . ( groans ) What 's wrong ? Oh , I woke up with this headache . I thought it was gone already . You were telling me about your accident . I 'm not feeling much like talking right now . Would you mind letting me rest for a while ? I 'm sorry . Sure , not at all . I 'll put the tray here . That way , it 'll be here if you wake up hungry . You were right , you know . I guess I don 't care if my husband sees my sadness . Early in the morning of the 5th , this debris was recovered in a field near Roswell , New Mexico . Earlier reports have stated that this debris was the wreckage of a flying saucer . I 'm afraid we are here today to pop that balloon and replace it with one of our own . This , gentlemen , is a weather balloon . On any given day in the United States , there are hundreds of these in the air , and they do not come from outer space . They are manufactured in Cleveland . This is its radar reflector . It tracks wind speed . None of this debris is from outer space . The reflector is made in Newark , New Jersey , and the balloon is made in Cleveland . Excuse me , sir . I wonder if I might have a word . Yes , Captain ? I was wondering , sir , what we 're gonna do now . About what ? About the craft , about the bodies . What craft ? What bodies ? MAN : It 's clearly organic . SECOND MAN : It 's not clearly anything . Jenkins says it 's animal , and it takes on the characteristics of an animal cell . Kraus says it 's some sort of fungus , which would explain its sameness and density , and we look again , and it has those characteristics . It seems to be able to change ... into whatever we want it to be . You 'd all better come see Dr Goldin . ( man singing in Hebrew ) MAN : I came to check on the body from the crash , and I found him like this . CAMPBELL : What 's he saying ? Is it German ? Goldin wouldn 't speak German . It 's Hebrew . What has he done with the body ? My God . ( panting ) Hello , operator ? I 'd like to place a call to Fresno , California . Madison 4573 . Yes , ma 'am , thank you . ( toy rattling ) My crew of nine men ... Eight of them are dead . And Johnson , my co-pilot ... He 's in the hospital at Fort Bliss , not expected to recover . What happened to them ? No one knows . No one has any idea at all . What are you doing ? I have to find out what 's happened to my men and what 's happening to me . No , you don 't . Kate , I 'm no husband ... and I 'm no father to our boy until I can find out what 's going on . You 're not going to find anything out there , Russell . What do you think you 're gonna find ? - Bishop , right ? - I 'm Bishop . You flew Colonel Campbell out of Fort Worth the other night . - Right . - Destination ? That 's need-to-know . Army intelligence . I need to know . Captain Crawford . Is that right ? Colonel Campbell told me you might want to talk to me . ( footsteps approach ) WOMAN : A gentleman to see you , Miss . OWEN : Can you go for a ride ? I 'll get my car coat . No , I said a ride , not a drive . Loosen up on the reins just a little . - Okay . Okay . - There you go . - Like that ? - Yep . There you go . You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm good . - Okay . You all right ? You doing okay ? - You want to go faster ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? - Yes , please . Okay . Okay . Where did you learn to ride ? One of my many odd jobs before I found the army . Well , I 'm glad you found us . I was afraid you wouldn 't come out with me . Why wouldn 't I come ? Your father . He 's so dead set against you and me seeing each other . I 'm not quite sure why he has such a low opinion of me . Well , I 'm not my father . I know that . You 're the sun and the moon to me , Anne . The sun and the moon . Here we go . Thank you . You 're welcome . ( chuckles ) ( giggles ) Um ... Anne ... I had to come up through the ROTC ranks . I may never be anything more than a captain . I don 't care . But I can tell you this- - I 'm gonna do some things in this world , Anne . I am nobody 's fool , and I know that I can make my mark . Anne ... Will you marry me ? Owen , what happened back there up on the hill- - I would never do anything like that with anyone but the woman I intend to marry . Marry me . - Owen . - ( laughs ) Marry me . I want to tell your father . Do you have any idea where he 's gone ? He seemed to be able to reach inside my brain , to use my own memories as a stage on which to mount our conversation . I don 't quite follow , professor . I was there ... in that room ... My bar mitzvah in Dresden . If I could have stayed ... I could have spoken again with my father . ( alarm sounding ) I wish ... to see my father . What in God 's name happened here ? They 're both dead . ( siren ) Mind stepping out of the car , sir ? What did I do , officer ? Would you mind stepping out of the car , sir ? Thank you , officer , I 'll take it from here . Captain Crawford , Army Intelligence . This is a routine debriefing . Routine ? I apologize for the unconventional approach . I 'll be honest with you . There 's a leak in the project . Someone 's talking . We don 't suspect you , but we need to go over some information to verify the source of the leak . Does this have to do with what happened to Dr Goldin ? In part , yes . I don 't see how Dr Goldin 's death could have anything to do with a leak . Why don 't you tell me what you think happened ? Well , Dr Goldin was in the room with , uh ... the one that turned out to be alive . Apparently , they can ... well , uh , this is incredible . We saw it first on a cellular level . They can become whatever they want . I don 't follow you at all . They can appear as people . Dr Goldin , for example , thought he was 1 3 , at his bar mitzvah . He saw his father . Apparently , that 's what killed him . And the ... visitor . You 've been a lot of help , and , doctor , I think you can appreciate how important it could be that you say nothing about this to anyone . They can appear as people , you say ? Yes , as unbelievable as that seems . And exposure to one of these apparitions , that 's what killed Dr Goldin ? It 's not safe to spend too much time with one of them . Whoa . How do you feel ? Like I 'm floating . Headaches ? Anything like that ? Nothing like that . That 's good . That 's good . ( footsteps ) Tom ? Becky ? Wimmy , wammy , woo ! That was amazing . BECKY : Mama , John 's been doin ' magic tricks that are much better than Tom 's . You 're not hungry ? - No , l- - - He 's never hungry . Tom , that 's enough . No , it 's all right . How are you feeling ? Your headache ? I 'm fine . I hadn 't even thought about it . Thank you . Good . That 's good . TOM : So where did you come from , anyway ? - Tom ... - I don 't mind . I come from Des Moines . That 's like 1,000 miles away from here . How 'd you know that ? It 's where my magic kit came from . Tom , Becky , sit up and watch your manners . I come from there originally . I 've just been working anyplace I could since then . Farm work , mainly . What happened to you that got you so messed up ? Machine accident . Why are you being so mean to John ? - He 's our friend . - He 's not my friend . You certainly seem to be recovering nicely . Like I told you , I just needed a little rest . SALLY : So now that you 're feeling better , I guess you 'll be moving on ? JOHN : I guess so . I just need a few more days . Everyone knows not to stare into the sun . It 's something your mother tells you when you 're a kid . " Don 't look at the sun . or you 'll go blind . " But sometimes you want to understand something so badly that you 'll risk going blind for just a glimpse of what it all might be about . Damn . I brought you something . Thanks , Captain . You got married , huh ? Same girl ? The one that worked at the bank ? Yeah , same one . What the hell are you doing here , Captain ? Not that I 'm not glad to see you . Do you know about the other men ? What about them ? They 're dead . Same thing ? Yeah , more or less . What about you ? How come you 're the walking one and only ? I don 't know . Do you believe in God , Captain ? Yes . Yes , I do . How about you ? Not in any way that helps . Look , I 'm sorry , Captain . I don 't mean to sound bitter . I should be thanking you . After all , you saved my life . The thing is , Johnson , um ... Except for these dreams ... I 've been having ... I don 't remember a thing about what happened . Aw , well , hell , Captain , that 's a damn shame , 'cause you were an A-1 , Audie Murphy hero . Whatever they did to us , they did for a long time . Whenever I 'd stop screaming , I 'd hear one of the other guys . It seemed like we were there for days . You were on the cot next to mine . I don 't know , maybe it was sloppy , maybe they thought we were just too far gone to care , that we wouldn 't fight back , but they put that machine gun down right across from your cot ... And they left the clip in the gun , almost like they didn 't quite understand how a machine gun worked . Well , you sure as hell showed them , Captain . Only one thing . You and I both know it wasn 't Germans you killed that day . It wasn 't Germans at all . How are you coming with the canvass for the fifth occupant of the craft ? We haven 't had much luck , sir . You might be interested to know there was another live one , at least he was when he was brought in . Our scientists have learned that they have certain abilities . What kind of abilities ? In good time . Colonel Campbell ... he 's a small and petty man . I don 't like him . He 's an idiot ! In an attempt to control the most important revelation of the century , if not all time , the colonel has confiscated the bodies and initiated a high-level cover-up . He froze you out , just like he did to us in that field . He doesn 't share the limelight , and I 'm not a person you freeze out . I 'm gonna take this project from him . In the process , I hope to ruin his career . I will also take down anyone who stands with him . I 'm under the impression that the two of you would never make that mistake . No , sir . If you were to have a bit of luck in your canvass for what is now the only live visitor , I would hope you 'd share that information with someone who 's more forthcoming than the colonel . - We would , sir . - Yes , sir . Good , Howard . Oh , I mentioned that they had certain abilities . Don 't confine your search to little grey men . Look for someone who 's a little bit more ... human . Ah , this is beautiful country . I guess it is . Live in a place long enough , you forget to notice that sort of thing . I think it 's important to always try and see as much as you can . Sometimes a person 's life can spoil the view . You 're a really special woman . You need to believe me when I tell you that . ( chuckles ) You don 't know what you 're talking about . Yes , I do . You know , I 've ... I 've done some things I didn 't mean to do . You don 't have to tell me . And I 've- - I 've had to learn to control my emotions . It 's okay ... It 's all been worth it ... 'Cause it brought me to you . Oh , I don 't know what 's happening here ... But I sure as heck don 't care . And when the Indians first saw the Spaniards , they thought they were gods or devils . Because to the Indians , white man did not look like man at all . I don 't like him . I think he 's nice . Ahem ! ( whispers ) Children ... these gentlemen are from the United States Army . They are searching West Texas for a deserter . This man ran away from his post . These men think he might be hiding around here somewhere . If anyone has seen a stranger 'round these parts , you let us know about it right away . Don 't go trying to talk to him yourself . This fella 's dangerous , boys and girls . I want to go through through his clothes and stuff , see if I can find anything from the army . I don 't know , Tom . The sheriff said the deserter was dangerous . That 's why I want to know if it 's John . Come on ! Where are his clothes ? BECKY : Tom ! It 's him . JOHN : It 's who ? Now listen to me . You think you know something , but you don 't . Ah , ah . Let me go ! Let me go ! Let him go ! Let him go ! My business here is almost done , and I won 't let you interfere . BECKY : Tom , your nose is bleeding . I 'm sorry , Tom . I ... SALLY : Where is everybody ? What 's with them ? See for yourself . ( dogs barking ) - TOM : Sheriff ! Hey , sheriff ! - All right , son . The man you 're looking for is at our house . SHERIFF : Come on , let 's move out ! Harry , you take the south road ! My boss down at the diner called to say that there were some soldiers in town looking for a deserter from the army base in New Mexico . I know you come from a place a whole lot further than that . I don 't know how you do what you do . I know you can see into people . They 're gonna be coming for you soon . My grandmother gave me these . She came over to Texas in 1893 . I always thought they were kind of funny . They 're for Texas , the Lone Star state , and there 's two of ' em . Will you take one with you ? And I 'll keep the other . Can I see you once before you go ? You better go inside . ( engine dies ) What 's this ? Come on ! ( engine sputters ) I don 't know what the trouble is . ( whooshing ) That summer . a lot of things had happened that people couldn 't explain . There had been lights in the sky and stories in the paper about saucers crashing . John had come . and then he had gone . Put it on the table . Take the cookies out . For a while . life went back to being life . and almost everyone forgot the things that that summer had brought with it from out of the sky . ( knocks ) He 's gone , hasn 't he ? He has . Home ? Yes , home . I guess I 'm too late , then . Ma 'am . ( screaming ) JOHNSON : What the hell are you doing here . Captain ? RUSSELL : I don 't remember a thing about what happened . I don 't remember a thing about what happened . Aw. well. hell . Captain . that 's a damn shame . You sure as hell showed them . Captain . You were an A - 1 . Audie Murphy- - You sure as hell showed them . Captain . Only one thing . You and I both know those weren 't Germans you killed that day . Those weren 't Germans you killed that day . Wasn 't Germans at all . I thought I told you to keep that woman away from me . I 'm doing my best , sir . She 's somewhat persistent . Persistent ? Right . Sue , it 's so good to see you . Lieutenant Bowen , this is Sue . HOWARD : Ma 'am . You don 't even know my last name . I haven 't been coming here for two weeks about you and me , Owen . I came about this . Where 'd you find this ? Up at Pine Lodge . Here , come in my office . That night after you ditched me to go to the movies with that army brat , I was out driving around . I saw something crash . I went up there , and there was something in the trees , but it was dark , and I couldn 't really see what . And then I found that . And you brought it to me . Sue , you never let me explain about that night . I was supposed to meet the colonel . He was ill , and his daughter came to give me the message . Sure she did . You completely misunderstood the situation . Sure I did . You are the sun and the moon to me , Sue . The sun and the moon . - Boo ! - Aah ! You really should get in the habit of locking your door . Oh , well . It 's too late . Owen Crawford is the best commanding officer , boss , advisor , and all-around good guy that I 've ever come to know . And , Anne , well , you 're not just marrying Owen . You 're getting me and Marty , too , and everyone else who 's ever served under him . So I hope you like company . T o Owen and Anne ... congratulations . ( piano playing The Way You Look Tonight ) Dance with me . ( giggling ) I can 't believe it . You can pour one for me , too , Dad . If I didn 't think that it 'd break my daughter 's heart , I 'd kill you where you stand . But it really would break her heart . You know what I 'd like as a wedding present ? - I 'd like to be a major . - What ? A major . Anything less , and it wouldn 't be right when you put me in charge of your little project at Wright Field . That project is mine . You won 't see the inside of that laboratory . I disagree . It 's an alloy unknown on this planet . There 's no translation , ancient or modern , for the language . It was found at Pine Lodge , at the crash site . Either you give me exactly what I want , or I 'll go public with this . I 'll bring your flying saucer crashing down on your head ... Dad . Enjoy your new promotion . Oh , and , uh ... I 'd never do anything to hurt Anne . She 's the sun and the moon to me . Hey , Tyler , what do I have to do to get a refill in here today ? Well , just hang on a minute , will you , Larry ? Sally will be right there . ( radio plays ) Sally ? Sally , honey , you all right ? I 'll be out in just a minute . Honey , what 's the matter with you ? Oh , hell , Tyler . I 'm pregnant . Well , Fred 'll be proud . Oh . Honey , I 'm sorry . My mother always talked to me a lot about the sky . She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night ... especially the stars . We would play a game sometimes ... a game called " What 's Beyond the Sky ? " We would imagine darkness or a blinding light or something else that we didn 't know how to name . But of course , that was just a game . There 's nothing beyond the sky . The sky just is . and it goes on and on . and we play all of our games beneath it . # . Stay all night , stay a little longer # . # . Dance all night , dance a little longer # . # . Pull off your coat and throw it in the corner # . # . I don 't see why you don 't stay a little longer # . KATE : " In ordinary times , " ordinary boys led ordinary lives filled with ordinary things , " but these were not ordinary times , " and Charlie Chestnut was no ordinary boy . " He was the invited guest of Artemis P. Fonswick . " All the animals knew Artemis . " It was hard not to know a squirrel who was four feet tall . " Artemis lived in the biggest oak tree in the woods . " Inside the tree was a three-room house " with a bedroom and a sitting room " and a pantry with as many nuts as a person , " or a squirrel , for that matter , would ever want to eat . " " You could only find Artemis ' home if you 'd been invited , and now Charlie Chestnut had been invited . " BOY : Mum ? Go to sleep , Jesse . You think Daddy ever thinks about us ? Of course he does , honey . You think he 'll ever come and see me ? You know I love you very much , and you know Bill loves you , too , just like you were his own boy . Was it the war that made Daddy go away ? Kind of , honey . I don 't really remember him . I just thought maybe if you could call him on the phone or something that he could be my invited guest . Go to sleep . - Jesse asleep ? - Yeah . Did Charlie go into the woods and find Artemis yet ? We always get to the part where he 's about to go . Love to know what happens when he gets to Artemis ' house . You 'll get there . He 's asking about his father again . He wants to know if Russell can come visit . What did you tell him ? What can I tell him ? How about you , Kate ? You still miss him ? I 'm married to you now , Bill . That 's not what I asked you . That 's what I thought . Hey . Hey . He ran out on us . You were there , and you didn 't go anywhere . Don 't think I don 't know that . ( electricity buzzing ) ( moaning ) ( chuckles ) ( grunts ) ALLIE : When you 're a kid. all you ever want is for the stories your mum reads you to be true . You think you can crawl inside the world that 's in every book and live in the pictures on every page . but deep down you know that this isn 't something that could ever happen . And it 's knowing that the magic isn 't quite there . that it 's just over the next hill or maybe in the next story . that makes you feel safe in your bed at night . You really wouldn 't want it to be any other way . Whoa . ( laughs ) JESSE : Whoa . ( radio playing country music ) ( gasps ) ( tires squealing ) MAN : There 'll be no more need for weapons that kill men . Think those Volturans were on the level ? I 'm sure they were . There have never been any people in history who wouldn 't be free of a dictator if they could . Alpha was sure pleased . He said he 'd supervise their elections . MAN : If all men ... BOY : Little green men ! Fire your ray gun ! ... worship as they wished . the universe need never know war again . - ( guns buzz ) - Aah ! ALLIE : There are times when it seems like the whole world is afraid ... Captain Video , blast the Martian invader ! They 're no use against Zultan ! ... when the fear is something you have to live with day in and day out . - Use the nails from last year . - I 'm trying . When people get scared . they do a lot of different things . They fight or they run . they destroy the thing they 're afraid of . or they put a lot of distance between it and them ... Hey ! Watch it ! ... make it something you can shoot at with a friction-action gun . We 'll get a tree tonight when I get home , okay ? Okay . Bye , boys ! And try not to destroy the universe , all right ? BOY : Bye ! We took this craft apart more than ten years ago . More than ten years , and we still have no idea how it ran , no clue what its power source was or what the aerodynamics involved were . In fact , we know less now than we did when we found the damn thing . Just chime in if I 've left anything out , gentlemen . Two years ago , some tiny circuit you thought might do something electrical . Or was it something that stored information ? The year before , you thought you 'd found out what the thing was made of . Ten years , gentlemen , and so far all we have to show for all your hard work is a way to hold my pants up without a belt . Sir , we 're dealing with technology so far beyond ours , we can 't even find a place to start . We are in a space race. gentlemen . Suppose another craft crashed or was brought down over the Soviet Union . Could you imagine the implications if the Russians were to master this technology first ? I hardly think that 's likely . Do you have a better explanation for the success of Sputnik ? - Sput- - - Do you ? This is Dr Kreutz . He 's here with Lockheed , working on a technology for a plane that can fly undetected by radar . You may have seen the prototype out in the yard . His is a project that shows some signs of yielding results . Dr Kreutz has agreed to come to our program for an indefinite period of time . Of course , a physicist of such eminence comes with his own people . As of today , you gentlemen are reassigned to other duties . We 've been receiving reports of very strange radio signals coming from our base in Iceland . Captain Bowen has the details of your transportation for you . Merry Christmas . I 'm afraid I owe you an apology , Doctor . Why ? One of the burdens that comes with this assignment- - I report directly to the president . General Eisenhower is not a patient man . I 've led him to believe that some of your technological advances were derived from our research . What advances ? General Eisenhower was particularly impressed by the Explorer satellites you sent up earlier this year . I hope when you meet the president , you won 't disabuse him of his impression . And be reassigned to Iceland a week before Christmas ? Certainly not . Let me see your little bird . ( alarm sounding ) The interior wasn 't damaged in the crash . It 's exactly as it was when we found it . May I ? It is easy to see what has baffled your researchers for all these years . No instrument panels , no monitoring devices . Nothing . And yet even now there is a sense of energy here . We have to limit exposure in here . There 's some sort of field or something . In about six minutes , your head will start to ache . Twenty minutes maximum before you have a cerebral hemorrhage . You will never get this craft off the ground without an engine . We can 't find the engine . There were five of them . They died in 1 947 . KREUTZ : These are beings of unimaginable power of mind . The ability to reach inside a man 's mind and give him the images lurking there- - surely that requires more energy than what is needed to guide a ship among the stars . The power of mind- - that is the energy source your scientists have been unable to find . What do you suggest we do , Doc , wait until they crash again ? - That is one option . - What 's another one ? Find someone else with unimaginable power of mind . ( children chattering ) Oreos and a peanut-butter - and-jelly sandwich . You 're wrong . My mum promised me a steak sandwich and pie . How 'd you do that , weirdo ? Your mum and dad had a fight last night about him being drunk . She used the steak on her eye . She didn 't feel much like making anything fancy . You 're dead , brainier . ( bell rings ) Hey , there he is . Talk to me about my parents again , creep . Are you hiding in the bushes outside my house ? Tell me where you were , you little weirdo ! BOY : Get him ! You 're gonna die . Travis . Travis , look at me . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! ( sobbing ) No . No . No ... BOY : What did you do , freak ? ( Travis sobbing ) ( Christmas song playing on radio ) I 'm sorry I was late , hon . I got working ' in that shed . Lost all track of time . How was the last day of school ? Everybody excited about the big vacation ? Honey , are you feeling all right ? You don 't have a fever . I made you some fried chicken and brought you a Pepsi . Here you go . You can eat it now or you can rest until we get to Amarillo . I love you , honey , every day and twice on Sunday . ( whistle blowing ) MAN : Rock 'n ' roll died last March 24th when Elvis went into the army . Wouldn 't you agree , Captain ? I was just saying rock 'n ' roll died when Elvis went in the army . Yeah , if you say so . The captain 's not one for conversation . The way he holds on to that ratty duffel of his , you 'd think it was full of gold . Go easy . He is not right . I 'm just trying to make friendly conversation . Man thinks he 's the only one with a past . My father liked to say that there were these things in life that didn 't make any sense . and they could never make any sense . and if you were anywhere near smart. you knew that . But your job was not to give up . to keep on trying to make sense out of them anyway . trying to understand things that could never be understood . I guess maybe people will always find different names for their answers . but the one thing is their questions will always be the same . MAN : It was on my second trip to Venus that I first met Renuthia and learned the answer to the question that I 'm sure has brought you here this evening , and that is , " What do our space brothers and sisters want from us ? " Well , what they want more than anything is for all of us to be friends . Hey ! Hey , Captain . Give those back . Yeah , what the hell , Captain . Sure . Uhh ! MAN : This is the dawning of a new era of peace and understanding . That is truly what they want us to know , that we are all part of the same great whole , that we all belong to the light . These people are very gentle . Their message is only one of kindness . You want to tell us what you think about Elvis getting drafted , or are you still too hoi polloi ? I want my things back . Your hero medals ? What you get your medals for ? What kind of man did you used to be before you became just another lost soul ? You hit him again , I believe he 'll die . He 'll die or I 'm gonna have to give back his things , and I don 't want to do that . The Feds ! Come on , fellas ! Whoa ! Get away from me ! ( banging ) Just go--now ! Get away from me ! ( whimpers ) ( screaming ) That is the message that I want to leave with you tonight . They mean us no harm . They don 't want to hurt us . More than anything else , they want us to know ... they come in peace . RUSSELL : No ! No ! No , not again , you bastards ! No ! Aah ! ( screams echoing in distance ) ( boy gasping ) ( whispers ) Jesse . I 've met them , too . One of them , at least . There you are . Do you think they 'll be comin ' back soon ? Our time and their time is not the same time . Are you planning on coming to our New Year 's festival ? I hadn 't heard of it , actually . Fifteen dollars includes a buffet dinner . We 're gonna call our space brothers and sisters . - Thank you . - Bye , now . ( gasps ) ( flames crackling ) Breakfast ? Compliments of Irish Dave and the others . - They 're gone ? - Left in kind of a hurry . Um ... Dave , um , wanted you to have these back and to know that he was sorry and that if he ever saw you again- - which he hopes that he doesn 't- - that you would- - you would please forgive him . ( train whistle blows ) Whenever you 're in the mood , I , uh ... I wouldn 't mind knowing what happened here last night . I was a pilot in the war . Did I mention that ? - You flew B-1 7s , right ? - That 's right--23 missions . I guess you earned those medals the hard way . My crew . Nine men . All of them are dead . What happened ? Something like what happened last night . We were taken . That 's the best way I know how to describe it . Taken by who ? Whatever they did to us , it killed my men . I know that for a fact . What I don 't know what I c- - what I can 't understand is why am I alive ? What 's that ? These are aeronautical maps of the United States . You see , I keep a record . Every place they pick me up , the exact location , the exact time . I-l-I 'm just trying to find a pattern to it . If--if I could know when they were coming , - I could- - - You could what--run ? - You could get away ? - Yeah . From what I saw last night , it ... it seems like you 're a bit outclassed . Maybe they don 't know , either . They don 't know why you 're the only one that lived . Maybe that 's why they keep taking you- - to find out what sort of thing you 've got . Maybe there 's something in the blood something that makes you special . # . O come ye to Bethlehem # . # . Come and behold him # . # . Born the King of angels # . # . O come let us adore Him # . # . O come let us adore Him # . # . O come let us adore Him # . # . Christ the Lord # . ( knocks ) ( conversation , piano playing in background ) Hey , Jesse . Jesse , your mother needs your help in the living room . Go ahead . You 're not welcome here , Russell . I know . I had something I needed to tell Jesse . You lost the chance when you ran out on him and his mother . - You can stay in the lockup . - I didn 't come here for that . Well , you can 't stay here . I don 't want Kate seeing ' ya . Bill , Jesse 's in danger . I need to talk to him . It 's not gonna happen , Russell . - GIRL : Watch out ! - BOY : Here goes ! GIRL # 2 : How about we build us a snowman ? Here I come ! We need more sticks for hair . BOY : Ow ! That hurt . - GIRL : He 's okay ? - GIRL # 2 : Yeah . - Gotcha . - Hurry ! Hello , Jesse . Christmas is all about hope . Kids hope for new toys . You get older. and the toys get bigger . but the hope stays the same . Some people might hope for peace on earth or maybe for a better tomorrow . whatever their idea of that might be . but most people still just want something bright and shiny and new . ( jet flying overhead ) It 's a local . Get us as far as maybe the Kentucky line . - You ever done this before ? - No , sir . - You willing ' to try ? - You bet . On 3--1 , 2 , 3 ! - What are you looking at ? - You look just like your mother . Everyone says I look more like you . I don 't see it . Oh , I got something . Yeah . I 've , uh , been wanting to give you these . There you go . Merry Christmas . These are your war medals ? You can put ' em on later if you want . I got this one the first time I was shot down , over Belgium . This one was for one time when we took a lot of flak , and I got some in my leg . And this one- - that 's a Silver Star . Got that on my last mission . When you were shot down and captured and you saved your entire crew . Mum said it was the war that made you go away . But you know it wasn 't , don 't you ? So ... is this what you been doing the whole time ? This where you live ? Yeah , I live where I can . Listen to me , Jesse . What was happening to me ... I didn 't want to bring it home to you and your mother . Who are they ? I don 't know . Can you keep them from coming back for me again ? I don 't know that , either . But I 'm sure as hell gonna try . ( screen door creaks ) Jacob ! - Merry Christmas ! - Merry Christmas . You look great . TOM : Watch out , now ! Hey , there , little brother . Where 's Mum ? She 's in the shed . In the shed ? What 's she doin ' in there ? - She 's working on something . - Workin ' ? It 's Christmas Day . I didn 't bring all these presents for nothin ' . I think she thought you were coming later . She hasn 't put the turkey in the oven yet . I should go see if I can help . Hello , hello ! Merry Christmas ! I thought I heard your car . TOM : Mama ? Hey , there . Merry Christmas . What are y 'all doin ' here so soon ? I thought you weren 't comin till this evening . Well , it 's 5 : 00 . Goodness gracious , where does the time go ? What are you doin ' in there , makin ' moonshine ? Oh , get on inside . I 'm so happy to see y 'all . ERIC : This one 's kind of messy . SAM : I think it 's the usual--underwear . ERIC : Doesn 't make any noise . Sounds like clothes . This one looks like a cookie , here . Mum , is Dad home yet ? Not yet , sweetheart . Could I open just one present ? Let 's just wait a little while longer , okay ? Your dad wants to be here when you open his gifts . - How much longer , Mum ? - Just a little while . ( O Come All Ye Faithful playing ) Tom 's pullin ' money in hand over fist on that real estate , Mama . I know he is . I 'm so proud of him . And of you . First one in our family to go to college . Tom and I were talkin ' about with all his extra money , maybe he could get Jacob into a school someplace . Jacob is fine here with me . The school that Tom found is in Montana . It 's for children who are special , different . Of course he 's different . When is the last time you saw him laugh or cry ? When is the last time he hugged you ? When is the last time he smiled ? This school might be able to help him , Mum . There 's nothin ' wrong with Jacob . He 's fine here with me . ( oven timer dings ) I 'm sorry about the turkey , y 'all . Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas , Mama . RUSSELL : Merry Christmas . ( laughing ) - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas , Esther . Ladies , come on . It 's a wonderful service you are providing for your country . We appreciate this . ( cameras whirring ) It 's been 20 minutes . We have to get them out . - Give it another five minutes . - Sir , that will kill them . They were dead the second they set foot on this base . ( unlocks door ) ( drops keys on table ) The boys are asleep . We waited as long as we could . I 'm sorry . Something came up . You gave them both a Lionel train set . Sam got the Space Patrol board game and the Leave It To Beaver lunch box . Eric got the Leave It To Beaver board game and the Space Patrol lunch box . They both got Hula Hoops . What did I give you ? A hell of a lot more than I bargained for . ( brakes squeak ) ( grunting ) ( camera shutter clicks ) This is kind of mean , Tom . Becky , Mum really believes this crap . That 's why she 's always taking Jacob to all those conventions . All we have to do is show her that it 's a trick , make her see how easy it is to fake . You were with me . We saw those lights in the sky . The Lubbock Lights , yeah . Quarrington wrote a chapter about it in his book and Popular Science had an article about it . It was a reflection of streetlamps off a flock of plover birds . We were little kids , Becky . We saw what we wanted to see . Just because some creepy guy ends up in our barn doesn 't mean he 's from Mars . Venus . Quarrington says they 're from Venus . If you turn on the porch light , it 'll make it look more like it 's in the sky . Jake , what are you doin ' up ? I don 't want to go away to school . There was a lady watching me in class . She wasn 't from here . I could sense her interest . Jacob , you have to try to understand- - you have sort of a gift , an insight . I get that from my father . You need to be in a place where people understand you . If I go away , who 's gonna take care of Mum ? SALLY : Kids ! Y 'all come here ! It 's ready ! I call this a contactor . What do you think ? Yeah . Uh ... - What is it ? - It 's sort of like a radio . I 'm hoping to transmit a message up into space . Sounds kind of crazy , doesn 't it ? Why do you want to send a message into space ? Because I miss Jacob 's father and I want him to know that we 're all right . And I want him to come and get us . I want him to know that we 're ready to go . Go where , Mum ? Home . ( tyres squealing ) Jesse ? ( car doors opening ) Jesse ? ! Jesse ? Jesse ! ( guns cock ) BILL : Don 't move , Russell . Where the hell is Jesse ? What have you done with him ? I don 't know . I don 't know what 's going on ! OWEN : I told Eisenhower we had the saucer running . I promised him a demonstration by the second week in January . That gives us two weeks . Would you like to tell me what the hell went wrong ? It 's that kind of attitude that lost you people the war . The theory was sound . The Erenberg twins simply were not psychic enough . Not psychic enough ? They were the highest-rated sensitives on the Rhine scale . The professor at Duke said they were the best he 'd ever seen ! All right , so what are we gonna do ? I go back to working on planes powered by an energy I understand . ( chuckles ) I 'm afraid you can 't do that . I 've had you moved to the military . You work for me now . You told your president the test was a success . In order to keep me here with you , you 'd have to admit you had failed . We lost the war because the Russians betrayed our trust . There was never a question of our attitude . ( door closes ) What the hell you two lookin ' at ? Jesse ! MAN : I 'll go 1 00 yards this way ! Come on , boys . Find him ! BILL : Jesse ! MAN : Holler if you hear us , Jess ! Keep movin ' out ! MAN # 2 : On the left flank ! Jesse ! Kate . You bastard . What did you do ? I came back to try to save him . Save him ? What are you talking about ? They 're done with me . I don 't know how I know it , but I do . I don 't want to hear this . I just want to know what you did with my son . I didn 't do anything with him . They did . They took him . Kate , Jesse is special . They 're seeing if he 's ready . Ready for what ? Aah ! Get away from me ! Aah ! This New Year 's Eve party you 're goin ' to- - we think you should leave Jacob here with us . Y 'all don 't think he should be exposed to all the crazy people ? He gets tired so easily . Stayin ' up that late ... No , we don 't think he should be exposed to all those crazy people . I 'll be back tomorrow night . Y 'all aren 't gonna sneak him off to one of those schools ? No . We 'd need your signature anyway . We 're gonna sit around here and do some card tricks . I don 't know , maybe he is better off with all the loonies . I 'll tell him he 's stayin ' here . I bet he already knows . ( screen door opens ) Ohh , I love you ... every day and twice on Sundays . I 'll see you later . This is the last of the raw data . Still lots to go through . I want to look at everything . MARTY : 200 sightings in Central Illinois Christmas Day . - Anything ? - The Cold War . These people are frightened and delusional . You 're not helping me . HOWARD : Man who says he 's been visited by representatives of the planet Arnadon . Six hundred hovering yellow discs over Duluth . Woman who says the broadcasts on her television are from outer space . MARTY : Got the surveillance photos in from the Quarrington lecture in Amarillo . He 's beautiful . He will say anything we tell him to say . Trips to Venus , space brothers . I came up with that one- - " space brothers . " It 's very inspired . When you two are done , let 's get back to work . MARTY : Yes , sir . Ahem . These people call themselves " Contactees . " They believe they 've had contact with aliens . A bunch of them have built machines to talk to their space brothers . They 're all getting together on New Year 's Eve . They 're gonna turn on the machines . Maybe we could borrow one of the machines , call a spaceman , and ask him to come fly his ship for Ike . Maybe we don 't need to call anybody . Go back one . No , one more . How old do you think that kid is ? Why do people want so desperately not to be alone ? Why is it more comforting to think you are being watched than to know that no one at all is watching ? And why. really. does that make us any less alone ? In the end . if there are others out there . then wouldn 't we be. all of us . still alone together ? J-a-c-o-b . Jacob . That your card ? No ? What was your card ? Jack of diamonds . Jack . Jack for Jake , right ? They 're old cards . You know , the wax- - There 's a new deck in the top drawer there . Why don 't you go get it ? We 'll try it with that deck . Maybe then I can get it to work . ( pop music playing on radio ) Aw , come on . That 's a good trick . ( laughs ) Hey , Jake , come here . I want to talk to you about something . How long has Mum been talkin ' about , you know , goin ' to outer space and stuff ? I don 't know . It 's just something she says sometimes . How long has she been building that machine ? She 's not crazy . She 's just sad . Well ... you think this is the best place for you to be ? You know , around somebody who 's so sad ? Thank you all for coming , and a Happy New Year ! CROWD : Happy New Year ! Are you all ready to greet our space brothers ? Yes , we are ! I see a lot of you have brought devices for that purpose . If you 'll just turn them on now , then we can enjoy a nice leisurely buffet and hope that we have some guests join the party . ( hums ) ( crackles and buzzes ) ( beeps ) ( whistling ) That 's a sophisticated-looking device . How does it work ? I made it from a plan out of Fate magazine . These antennas are supposed to broadcast my brain waves up into space . How do they do that ? Well , you could either buy this thing that looked like a salad bowl or you could use this metal bucket over here . I 'm kiddin ' . Oh . ( laughs ) There 's a radio transmitter in there . I just turn on this microphone and hope for the best . You don 't remember me , do you ? I come to a lot of these things . Your machine--it 's to send a message to that ... to your friend you found in the shed , am I right ? - You were- - - With the army . I came to see you once . I lost my job over your friend . I filed a report saying I believed the man in your shed was an alien visitor who had returned to his planet . That opinion cost me my job and my pension ... not to mention my marriage . I thought you were lookin ' for him 'cause you knew he was from space . There are levels and there are levels . Once I told them what I knew , they had to make me go away . I 'll tell you something , though , all the time I worked for them , I was never a believer . It was just right before I met you when I saw the lights in the sky . You want to get a little dinner ? Mmm . - Like your pendant . - Thank you . Actually , it used to be a pair of earrings . Belonged to my grandmother . - What happened to the other one ? - I gave it away . Now it truly is a Lone Star , then , huh ? Think it 'll work ? I don 't know . I think whatever their plan is , it 's not gonna be changed 'cause of a couple messages from us . Well , why do you do it , then ? Passes the time . Because I miss him and there 's something that I want him to know about . That 's Tom , Becky . These are my kids from my late but not at all lamented husband . That 's Jacob . QUARRINGTON : Folks , can I have your attention , please ? In a few moments , it 's going to be 1 959 , so I 'd like to say Happy New Year again and thank you all for coming out . I 'm--I 'm only sorry we weren 't more successful , but we 're gonna try this again next month , so in the meantime , just , uh , just keep watching the skies . # ... . auld acquaintance be forgot # . # . And never brought to ... # . Maybe you should have sprung for the salad bowl , huh ? ( laughs ) # ... . be forgot # . # . And days of auld ... # . He knows , Sally . Wherever he is , he knows . # . Auld lang syne , my dear # . # . For auld lang syne ... # . ( gasping ) ( whirring ) ( whimpers ) ( sobbing ) Aah ! It was nice running into you again after all these years . It was . Maybe we 'll see each other again at one of these things , although I have to admit I 'm gettin ' a little tired of Dr Quarrington and all of his trips to Venus . With Renuthia ? ( both laugh ) You heading home in the morning ? - Mm . - Well , I hope we do . See each other again . I do , too . - Good night . - Good night . Owen ? You said that filing that report cost you your marriage ? I was just thinking that your wife must have been a very foolish woman to let you go . - Night . - Good night . ( door closes ) ( crack ) ( brakes squeal ) Are you gonna do that every day ? ( sniffles ) It 's good to keep linen fresh . Kate , we had to call off the manhunt today . Come on , it 's been seven days now . - ( sobs ) No . - We have to- - Kate ? We have to face the facts now . Okay ? Come on . He 's just a little boy , Bill . He 's just a little boy . I just ... ( crying ) No . There you go . Like that . ( car approaching ) Hey , y 'all . Kids , this is Owen Crawford . About the only evidence of UFOs at my convention was the mysterious breakdown of my truck . Mr Crawford was kind enough to give me a ride home . Jacob ! Jacob ? - Tommy , go after him . - Jacob ? ! Jake ? Jacob ? ! Jacob ! Jacob ! When you 're little. you like to think you know everything . but the last thing you really want is to know too much . What you really want is for grownups to make the world a safe place where dreams can come true and promises are never broken . And when you 're little . it doesn 't seem like a lot to ask . He 's come here for me . He wants to see if I 'm special . Well , then whatever you do ... don 't act special . Your mother tells me you 're in real estate , Tom . I hear you cleaned up on that East Texas boom last year . I did all right . Guess you 'll be headin back to your empire soon ? Yeah , I 'm leavin ' tonight . Sorry I won 't get more of a chance to talk . What do you do now , Owen , now that you 're not a soldier ? I was never a soldier . I was more of a spy . SALLY : Gosh , I 've never met a real spy before . Really ? How would you know ? It was never very glamorous . I mostly filed reports . Mum says you got fired for the one you filed on our ... visitor . Well , the , uh , the army and I had a disagreement . Let 's just put it that way . So what do I do now , Tom ? They didn 't exactly give me a letter of recommendation . I knocked around the Southwest for a while , odd jobs and such , then an uncle died and I came into a little money . I was thinking about buying into something- - a gas station or restaurant . Mr Tyler 's talkin ' about sellin ' the diner , isn 't he ? He already knew about Mr Tyler . That 's why he said it . SALLY : Jacob . Sorry . TOM : What are you tellin ' him to buy the diner for ? It just came out . He seems nice enough . He got booted out of the army for sayin ' the guy in our shed was from outer space . Mum met him at a flying saucer party . She needs someone in her life , Tom . I 'm goin ' back to U.T. , you 're goin ' back to work . If Jacob goes away , she 'll be all alone . Yeah , just her and the little green men . Y 'all be careful on this road , okay ? - You gonna call me ? - I will , Mama . Mum , will you think about what we talked about ? I already thought about it , honey . TOM : Come on , sis . We got miles and miles of Texas . You take care , Jake . You kids drive safe , now . ( engine starts ) ( footsteps approach ) MAN ON TV : Come on out . Pete ! This one 's a fight you 're never gonna win ! Don 't leave on my account , son . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what 's gotten into him . He 's jealous . We 'll work it out . - What are you watching ? - A western . Good guys in white , bad guys in black . No spacemen in green ? ( chuckles ) In town . Doc can get you all patched up ! - May I ? - Please . - Help me . - No. thanks ! ( gunshots ) I was , uh , gonna go into town and find a motel room . I was hoping I could meet you at the diner in the morning , talk to this--Mr Tyler , was it ? - -about his place . Sure . That would be fine . Sally , you don 't think I 'm crowding you here . I just ... Well , it sounds like a fine opportunity . Well , I think it is . Long as you do one thing . You gotta change Tyler 's chicken recipe . Tyler makes the worst fried chicken in all of West Texas . MAN : I 've always loved you . WOMAN : You think you can just run off and leave a girl ? MAN : I 've done things I can 't ever make up for . Owen , you don 't have to get a room in town tonight if you don 't want to . - It 's time to move on . - Then we 'll go together ... I 'll go change the bedding in Tom 's old bedroom . You can sleep there tonight . MAN : ... somewhere out in the woods . WOMAN : Don 't go . What are you doin ' ? Pete. come back . Come back ! - ( gunshots ) - WOMAN : Pete ! No ! No ! ( crying ) ( whistling O Susanna ) I 'm never gonna fly your saucer . Not ever . ( screen door opens ) SALLY : You two finally making ' friends ? Yes . Yes . We were getting acquainted . In fact , Jacob just told me everything I need to know . ANNE : Marty , Anne Crawford . Sam fell off the roof and broke his neck . They don 't know if he 's gonna live . If he does , who knows if he 's ever gonna walk again . I 'm in Las Vegas at the hospital there . Marty , I know Owen 's not in Washington . This is the kind of thing that he needs to hear from me in person . He 'll thank you for it , Marty . I promise you that . Lubbock , Texas ? I can find it . I found that two days after he left here . Nothin 's grown since . My heart 's sort of like that patch . You need to know that if you 're- - you 're gonna stay . I come from a long line of farmers . We can grow corn in a field where grass won 't grow . I 'm not goin ' anywhere , Sally . I 'm not . You 're the sun and the moon to me . SALLY : Okay , I 'm comin ' down . Y 'all don 't let me fall . Did you tell him about your idea yet ? I thought he 'd rather hear it from you . Sweetie , Mr Crawford thought today might be a fine day to take you fishin ' . Would you like that ? Nothin ' like a day on a lake for getting acquainted . I 'm sure your mum will be fine here without us . ( Flying Purple People Eater playing on radio ) # . Well . I saw the thing comin ' out of the sky # . # . It had one long horn ... # . ( lowers volume ) It 'll go easier for your mum if you help me out . You know that . # . It was a one-eyed . one-horned ... # . What are you gonna do afterward ... dissect me ? Depends on how much you can tell us without us having to cut you open . # ... . to me # . # . Well. he came down to earth ... # . We 're just the beginning of this , you and me . It doesn 't end with us . And there 's something else you should know in case you think you 've won anything . I 'm not the only one that matters . # . One-eyed. one-horned flying purple people eater # . # . One-eyed. one-horned flying purple people eater # . # . Sure looks strange to me # . # . I said . " Mr Purple People Eater " # . - ( knock on door ) - Just a second ! ( knock ) I 'm comin ' . Just a second ! I got something on the stove ! Jesus , I can 't believe I was that stupid . No , Mama , you don 't have to worry about that . We 're gonna get him back . ( dog barks ) ( dog howls ) ( dog barking ) ( Kate gasps ) Jesse ! Oh , Jesse . Oh , my . It 's okay . Jesse . You 're so cold . They told me Jesse was home . I left 50 bucks for you with the front desk officer . Don 't come back here . - Is Jesse all right ? - No thanks to you . Did he say what happened ? You fell asleep and he wandered off into the woods . But he is all right ? Kate wanted me to let you go . I 'm up for keeping you for the kidnapping charges . I don 't know what happened , but he 's been lost ten days . No , he 's not all right . Wait , wait . Bill--Bill , please- - Uhh ! Russell , I meant what I said . You don 't come back here . ( grunts ) Yeah , we should be there by tonight . Oh , he 's very well behaved . I told him I 'd kill his mum . What are you--what are you talking about , Marty ? And you told her where I was ? Do me a favour , Marty . Go to my house , see if my kids are there with the housekeeper . If they 're both fine , which I am sure they are , then start shopping for a very warm jacket . No . Do I sound like I 'm joking ? ( rock music playing ) Gonna need your strength . Mr Crawford , look at me . ( groaning ) Aah ! No ! No ! ( sobs ) No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! ( sobbing , screaming ) I called the army . They have no personnel records of an Owen Crawford after 1 947 . This just keeps getting better and better , doesn 't it ? What do you think they want with Jacob ? You don 't think the government believes in people from other planets ? No , I think they want us to believe . That way , anytime they test some new missile , they can blame a flying saucer . - What do they want with Jacob ? - I don 't know , Becky , but whatever it is , I 'm not gonna let them get their hands on him . Tom ? BECKY : Jacob ! Jacob ? Oh , I 'm so sorry . I never should have let you go . It 's all right , Mum . No , it 's not . I was a lonely , foolish woman . Should you have brought him back here ? It 's all right , Mum . Mr Crawford won 't be coming back . Let 's get inside , Mama . Come on . Let 's get you inside . You look terrible . I was worried sick about you . He 's asleep . I want him to go to that school . He has to disappear . If they come ... If they come lookin ' for him , there can 't be a trace . Tom and I have an idea about that . You keep this safe for me , okay ? I may not ever see you again . You 'll think about me once in a while ? Every day and twice on Sundays . I love you , Mum . ( knock on door ) What are you gonna do about Eisenhower , sir ? We got a report from the sheriff in Lubbock . What ? The sheriff in Texas ? There was a fire . Mother was working on some sort of invention in her shed . The kid died , sir . Good . What happened , Colonel ? You called in from the road , right ? Said you were bringin ' the kid in . So how did he get all the way back to Lubbock to be in that fire ? Did Marty tell you he was leaving for Iceland ? I might reconsider ... give the two of you another chance . That boy in Texas ... don 't ever mention him to me again . Glad to see you 're feeling all right , son . What are you talking about , Dad ? While I was away , I had this--I don 't know- - call it a premonition or something- - that you had been hurt . Glad I was wrong . Why don 't you boys get ready for bed ? - But , Dad ... - No , go ahead . SAM : Come on , let 's go . You followed me to Texas . You were having an affair with that woman . In my work , sometimes what I do can be distasteful . I thought you understood that . You 'd like to leave me . Yes . You know too much about what I do . - ( knock on door ) - Come in . - How you doin ' , buddy ? - I 'm all right . Jesse , I wanted to tell you something . Uh , I wanted to let you know ... um ... that is , if there 's anything you want to talk about at all , anything that happened while you were gone , uh ... I 'm not really that hard a guy to talk to . I was just lost . That 's all . Yeah . Okay . You know , your father , he was a real hero once . A real hero . You should be proud of that . Good night . ( shuffling cards ) People believe what they want to believe . They find meaning where they can. and they cling to it . In the end. it really doesn 't matter what 's a trick and what 's true . ( children playing outdoors ) What matters is that people believe . ALLIE : My grandfather used to tell my mum that kids should never have to worry about anything more serious than baseball . Everything you need to know is there . It has success and failure . moments where you come together and moments where you stand alone . And it has an ending . Not a clock . like in other sports . but an ending . And that. my grandfather used to say to my mum . is as close as a kid should have to come to that sort of thing . Can you even lift that bat ? PLAYER : Hey , batter , batter . ( scattered laughter ) Strike . Two more like that , and we can go home . PLAYER : Hey , batter , batter . You all right , kid ? PLAYER : Two down , one more . Come on . ( scattered applause ) ( kids shouting ) COACH : Hey ! - PLAYER # 1 : What happened ? - PLAYER # 2 : Is he okay ? Stand back . RADIO ANNOUNCER : One ball and no strike . Boyer 's in close at third . Rest of the infield back . Going for the double play on Keen . Marshall getting ready . The pitch to Keen . MAN : Hello , Jacob . Boyer at third base is calling for it . You know my name ? Of course . Everyone here calls me Jack . You know who I am ? You have certain capabilities . We both know what I 'm talking about . You mustn 't use them again . They 're what 's making you sick . What happens if I do use them ? At best , you 'll burn them out , lose them for good . At worst , they 'll take your mind with them when they go , and the strain of it could kill you . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . We 'll find another way . Who 's going to take the Series ? The Yankees in seven . Is that a guess or something else ? One ball. one strike . - A guess . - I think you 're right . There 's two outs ... Marshall Bridges trying to get them out . Checks his sign with Elston Howard . Here 's the one-two pitch . He swings and a long belt to right field ! It 's well-hit ! - Maris back at the fence . It 's gone ! - ( knock at door ) Jack ? Jack ? I 'm Dr Benson . I 'm sorry I wasn 't here to see you earlier , son , but when you 're the only doctor for 500 square miles , everybody expects you to be in three places at once . Now , let 's , uh , take a look at you and see what 's keeping you off the diamond . ALLIE : People like to examine the things that frighten them . to look at them and give them names . so saints look for God . and scientists look for evidence . They 're both just trying to take away the mystery . to take away the fear . PRESIDENT KENNEDY : Let me ask you this- - there were , if I remember from the report , four bodies on the craft ? OWEN : The craft held five , Mr President . We brought back four . This one was still alive when we brought him in . I don 't know if you 've seen the reports on that . Yes , I have . Quite a time he gave you there . And the fifth ? Uh , we never recovered that body , sir . I see . Well , it certainly doesn 't look as if they mean to attack us . What makes you say that , sir ? Well , from what you told me , if that was their intention , we 'd all be dead by now . We have one month to prove to him that our visitors are a threat . After that , he 's shutting us down and redirecting funds to the space program . The arrogant son of a bitch ! I need proof that there 's a clear and present danger . I need a smoking gun , gentlemen , and I need it now . ( radio plays ) My best subject in school was algebra . People always say algebra 's hard , but that is because they don 't get how easy it is . I just loved all those " Xs . " Anything you don 't know , you just put down an " X. " Or you can go with " Ys , " or " As " and " Bs . " In real life , you have one plus one , and if it doesn 't equal two , you 're up a creek . But in algebra , it always works , no matter what the answer is . You just have to figure out what " X " is . It 's a very beautiful thing . Oh , hey , honey , let me show you . Just let me do one . Let me show you . Mum ... It 's fine , honey . Mummy is gonna fix that . Why don 't you go and lie down ? - " X " marks the spot . - How many drinks have you had ? - Several . - How many pills ? Several . Those pills are for your nerves , not to be taken willy-nilly . Willy-nilly , eh ? Lie down before you fall down ! Finish your schoolwork , boys . OWEN : You 're disgusting ! You sober up , or I 'll have you put someplace , and- - ( doorbell rings ) Get in bed . And don 't come out of your room until morning . Esther , no , no . I got it . I got it . Thanks . Sorry to bother you , sir . You said you wanted to see these as soon as possible . Yes , of course . Come on in . Two possibilities , sir . Both very credible . Gail Arlen ... has reported repeated encounters since 1 960 . Divorced , no children , lives alone . ( coughs ) My doctor told me it would reduce my tension . Betty and Barney Hill . Encounters in 1 961 on their way back from Niagara Falls . He 's a postal clerk , and she 's a child welfare worker . They 're both active in their community . They 've begun some sort of therapy using hypnosis . - They 're very solid . - Very solid , sir . In both these cases , the people claim that they were taken aboard a craft . - Taken ? - Yes , sir . It could be just what we need . Lonely divorcee ... Makes up stories to get attention . Hypnosis , you say ? MARTY : Medical hypnosis , like they use on amnesia victims . No . No Negroes . It clouds the issue . - Sir- - - Just keep trying ! There must be somebody out there . Yes , sir . What the Russians want is nothing less than world domination . Communism is a religion , a faith like any other , with a holy text and saints and martyrs . The Russians see themselves as crusaders in a holy war . ( blows whistle ) Drop ! Is there any reason you 're not under your desk , Jack ? - I don 't see the point . - The point is to be ready . In the event of a nuclear attack on the Great Falls Air Force Base , which is the only military target within 500 miles , the initial blast would be jarring , but it wouldn 't even break our windows . You don 't take the threat of nuclear attack seriously then ? On the contrary , sir . I believe that within three days of an initial attack , 3 / 4 of the world would 've been destroyed . I don 't see the point of hiding from that kind of destruction under a desk . Everybody back in your seats . SPORTS ANNOUNCER : The Yankees lead one to nothing . the bottom of the ninth . MAN : Russell ? Yeah , I 'm heading to lunch . You want to keep an ear open for the phone ? Yeah , I 'm on it . Willie 's had one hit . That was a long triple . Here 's the pitch . He swings and hits a long drive ... It 's clearly a foul . It 's going in the seats . Willie McCovey. making a bid . slams one deep into right . The ball did not have ... Uhh . Maris going over near the line . but it curves back into the crowd . So it 's one strike to Willie . Boy. everything is riding on every pitch here in the bottom of the ninth . Hey , Jess . Who 's winning ? One-nothing , Yankees . Bottom of the ninth , two outs , and Mays just doubled . You like baseball . Ralph Terry gets set . Here 's the pitch to Willie . Here 's a liner straight to Richardson ! The ball game is over . and the World Series is over ! Willie McCovey hit it like a bullet ! A line-drive right straight to Bobbie Richardson at second base . Had that ball got out of his reach . the Giants would 've been the winners . Force of nature , those Yanks . ( turns radio off ) How 'd you know I was here ? I heard Mum talking to Dad ... to Bill . She said you got a job as close as you were legally allowed . She wanted him to come over and tell you to go someplace else . Well , he did . You grew up . I 've been reading these books about how the government knows about flying saucers . They 're afraid if they tell us , there 'll be panic . They started taking you again . It says in there where it 's mostly the Air Force that knows about them . So what I was thinking ... I mean , you were a pilot and all . Why don 't we go tell them ? Yeah . Why don 't we ? ( military cadence ) I 'm sorry . We got some kind of exercise just started . It 's got the whole base turned upside down . Captain . Real pleasure to meet you . My mum said my dad always spoke very highly of you . He was the best bombardier I ever saw . I don 't think he ever missed . He was a good friend of mine . How 's your mother doing ? - She 's doing fine . - Good . You speak to her , let her know I sent my best . Sure will . You going to join the service like your dad ? I might , sir . It 's a good life . Well , you said on the phone there was something I could help you with . Flying saucers . I 'm sorry ? My father and I have both seen them . We 've both been inside them . You 've both seen them ? Uh ... okay . Uh , well ... let me just ... ( clears throat ) get this all on record for you , then . ( typewriter clicking ) ( Bobby Vee sings Take Good Care of My Baby ) # Take good care of my baby # # Please don 't ever make her blue # How long after we left his office do you think he threw that report in the trash ? - We weren 't even out of the building . - He didn 't believe us at all . - No . - There 's got to be another way . The people who aren 't involved are all going to be like Lieutenant Wylie . They 'll smile politely and think we 're crazy . So how do we get to the people who are involved ? I just don 't know if they can do anything for us , Jesse . # Just let your love surround her # Hey ... I will do whatever it takes to help you . ( door opens ) # Once upon a time that little girl was mine # # If I 'd been true # # I know she 'd never be with you. so # # Take good care of my baby # # Be just as kind as you can be # Hey , Gus ! You might want to open a window . # And if you should discover # # That you don 't really love her # # Just send my baby back home to me # Smell of it . Can 't eat . # Well. take good care of my baby # # Be just as kind as you can be # What do you want ? Uh ... two bacon , lettuce , and tomato sandwiches and a cup of coffee . Okay . I 'll give you a cup of coffee . # Take good care of my baby # There you go . ( Roy Orbison sings Only the Lonely ) # Dum-dum-dum-dum dee-doo-wa # # Oh. yeah. yeah . yeah. yeah # # Oh. oh. oh. oh. ah # # Only the lonely # See you in hell , niggers ! ( tyres screech ) - Thanks . - Sure . Something 's wrong with your old man . Get a napkin for his mouth ! Something so he won 't bite his tongue off . Help me roll him on his side so he doesn 't choke if he vomits . Call an ambulance . Tell them this man is having a grand mal seizure . I 'm a med student at U of U. I know what I 'm talking about . Do it now ! ( Russell grunts ) It 's all right , sir . You 're gonna be all right . An ambulance is on the way . Dad ? You 're in the infirmary at the Air Force base . You had a seizure at the diner , and they brought you here . Guess there are some benefits to being a vet . I had this headache ... and there were gunshots . Yeah . Are you all right ? Yeah , they weren 't shooting at me . Those ... those two coloured guys that came in , did they get hurt ? Nobody got hurt . You think the seizures had anything to do with our friends ? Could be . ( chuckles ) It could also be the end result of all those fifths of vodka I hit myself in the head with every night for eight years . Captain Keys , how are you feeling ? Why don 't you tell me , doc ? This kind of thing ever happen to you before ? Yeah , once . I was home , and next thing I knew , it was two hours later , and I 'd sort of rearranged the furniture . Headaches are pretty constant , though . I 'd like to take you down to x-ray , see if we can find anything . You need to lie very still . Try not to move . ALLIE : We all like to think that we have some control over the events in our lives . and a lot of the time . we can fool ourselves into thinking that we really are in charge . But then something happens to remind us that the world runs by its own rules and not ours and that we 're just along for the ride . May I speak frankly in front of your son ? You have a tumour . It 's in the frontal lobe of your brain . It 's very , very small , but it appears to be putting pressure on your brain in unusual ways . Can you take it out ? ( sighs ) So what happens ? I 've never seen anything quite like this on an x-ray before . You might live a long and happy life , marred only by occasional headaches , perhaps more seizures like the one that brought you in here . Or it might kill you tomorrow . I 'm sorry . JESSE : Doctor ? Can you give me the same test you just gave my dad ? See if I have a tumour in my head , too ? Exactly the same size in exactly the same place . What are the odds ? The nature of the encounter seems to have changed . We have stories of missing time . People are losing several hours of their lives . In a few cases , hypnotherapy has filled in those missing hours , giving us a story of a meeting with little men that is reminiscent of some of my country 's experiments during the war . But these are more than mere meetings . These are , for lack of a better word ... abductions . That 's new . In the past , exposure for more than ten minutes was fatal . So we know they 've learned from their mistakes . Their technology evolves . Something has changed in their agenda . Or if not their overall view , certainly in their , uh , methodology . They are " upping the ante , " I believe you say . - Why now ? - Why not ? - Can we prove this ? - Well , we are working- - I need the most credible of these people . I need evidence that I can drop in Kennedy 's lap before he pulls our plug . What do you have for me ? Well , I went in to get some ice cream , and I saw the light out the kitchen window ... Bam ! Refrigerator falls over , plates start flying off the shelves . It was like sitting on the back of a wet dog shaking himself dry . It was the same in the living room . Everything 's falling . The house is shaking . I managed to crawl back in through the kitchen , and ... that 's pretty much it . Next thing Susan and I know , we 're back on the couch and it 's 2.00 in the morning . That 's 3 1 / 2 hours we lost . I 'd like to try to get those 3 1 / 2 hours back for you . - This is wonderful coffee . - SUSAN : Oh , thank you . They 're not coming back for these people . Call it a gut instinct , whatever you like . They 're one-timers , like when a fisherman throws back the little ones . What you have to find me are the keepers , and you have to find them yesterday . ( urinates ) ( sighs ) I know I 've threatened you both in the past with reassignment and with worse , and I 'm sure I don 't need to tell you how hard it 'll be for all of us to go back to a conventional military life if the president chooses to shut us down . But at least for me , there 's the comfort that I will have a rank , a position , and a place to go . When I took over this operation from my wife 's father , I made certain provisions for all the men who were assigned to me . Your names , ranks , and serial numbers no longer exist in any personnel file or other military record . You are , in effect , non-people . Without this organization , I 'm afraid you 'll find yourself hard-pressed to have a life . I 've said this before , Marty , but that is one nasty bastard . What are we going to do ? You remember Jacob Clarke ? The only person I 've ever heard of that scared the colonel . Too bad he 's dead . What if he isn 't ? His brother left for Montana the day after the fire in his mother 's shed . He had no business dealings there , no known friends , nothing . Maybe he likes to ski . Maybe . But let 's just say Jacob Clarke is still alive . Wouldn 't you like to know what it is about him that scares the colonel so badly ? Well , Becky , he turns out to be a colonel in intelligence . Owen Crawford . He 's the head of a classified operation that has something to do with unidentified flying objects . - Flying saucers ? - Uh-huh . Remember those guys ? This is what you 've been doing ? All those weekend trips , you 've been spying on these guys ? The last 3 1 / 2 years . You could get locked up for this , Tom . - They do that . - Only if they can catch me . Listen , Becky ... Whatever else may have happened to Mum , this guy broke her heart . My life is not gonna be complete until I ruin his . It 's as simple as that for me . In this year alone , we have put two men , John Glenn and Scott Carpenter , into orbit , and the Telstar Satellite has successfully telecast from outer space . Your world is different than the world of your parents and teachers in ways that none of us can yet fully imagine . Dr Greenspan . Sorry to bother you . Please go on with your class . Thank you . - Jacob ? - Yes ? Do you mind staying under there a while longer ? I 'm not sure I convinced our friends that you were already gone . Dr Greenspan ? Yes , dear ? Those men are following us . What do you want me to do ? Go a little bit farther . Don 't worry . I won 't let them hurt you . U.S. 12 West . If she hits 87 and goes north , she 'll be heading for Canada . I hate driving in the dark . It makes me nervous . If she goes south ... she could be heading for Billings . What if we hit a deer or go off the road ? It 's really dark . I--I have an astigmatism , you know . My night vision is not to be trusted . Do you want me to drive , Marty ? How 's your night vision ? Pull up alongside the car ... so I can shoot her . The kid won 't get hurt . Here they come . Okay , on three , stop the car and lay down flat on your seat . It 'll be all right . One ... Two ... Three . ( tyres screech ) Good evening. my fellow citizens . This government. as promised . has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military build-up on the island of Cuba . Within the past week . unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island . The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear-strike capability against the Western Hemisphere . Come in . Upon receiving the first preliminary hard information ... I want you to put me in touch with whoever runs the UFO program . We 're in the middle of a crisis here , in case you hadn 't heard . ... has now confirmed and completed our evaluation of the evidence ... There is no UFO program that 's run by the United States Air Force or any other branch of the government . - I don 't believe that . - You 're gonna have to go now . I 'll call someone to have you escorted off the base . ... several of them include medium-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead ... My father 's in your hospital . He has something in his brain . The doctors say it 's a tumour they can 't operate on . I 'm very sorry to hear that . I have an identical tumour in my own head . I believe these tumours were put there ... put there by whoever comes in those unidentified flying objects the United States Air Force knows nothing about . Our fathers fought together . That has to count for something . I don 't expect you to believe me , but I expect you to help me . ... self-discipline lie ahead . months in which both our patience and our will will be tested . months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers . But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing . The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards . as all paths are . but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world . The cost of freedom is always high . but Americans have always paid it . And one path we shall never choose . That is the path of surrender or submission . You tell anybody I gave you this name , I 'll deny it . ... but the vindication of right . not peace at the expense of freedom ... This guy 's a colonel at Groom Lake near Las Vegas . Thanks . ... and. we hope . around the world . God willing . that goal will be achieved . Thank you and good night . ( honks horn ) Help me get all these things inside . What 's all this ? The market was almost out of supplies . I 've never seen the shelves so cleared out . It was so crowded . I got everything I could . You 're expecting a world war ? You heard the president 's speech . Don 't give me that smirk , Colonel . Just because you 're in charge of the little green men project doesn 't mean you know all the secrets . Did you know that boys ? You 're daddy 's big , important , secret job is to figure out if we 're being attacked by Martians . You 're drunk , Anne . You shouldn 't take the car out when you 're drunk . He stole that job from my father . I don 't know how you did that . Took my daddy 's job . Get these groceries in the house . Now . You should really be more careful about what you say in front of the children , Anne . ( Bob Dylan sings Man of Constant Sorrow ) # I am a man of constant sorrow # - The guy ought to get a haircut . - I think he looks serious . Seriously stupid . And this song has no beat . I don 't think it 's supposed to have a beat . Boys , you must be done with all your homework . We just wanted to listen to some music first . You always could do your work at the last minute , but you 're setting a bad example for your big brother . Don 't look so bent out of shape . You 're not the straight-A student who can afford to spend an evening by the record player . I finished my homework at the library , sir . I guess that 's easier than having your mother spill her drink all over it . You guys worried about this missile crisis ? ERIC : I figure if there was going to be a war , you 'd know about it . You guys worried about your mother ? People dig their own graves , boys . That 's something you 'd do well to remember . These are her problems she 's dealing with , not yours . You 're my sons . I 'm gonna take care of you both . - You don 't need to worry about that . - Is it true ? Are you really in charge of some UFO project ? ( song continues ) No . Absolutely not . # Ooh. in this old world I 'm a-bound to ramble # You guys have the number of my private phone at the office ? I need to go in for a while this afternoon , see what I can find out about this crisis . If anything around here gets out of hand , I want one of you to call me , all right ? It 's kind of catchy . Colonel Crawford ? My name is Jesse Keys . My father 's name is Russell Keys . He was a pilot over in Germany in the Second World War . He and I have both had encounters with unidentified flying objects . We 've both been inside them . They 've come for us , they 've taken us , and they 're going to come for us again . Get in the car . Yes , sir . ( engine turns ) ALLIE : You know in cartoons . the way someone can run off a cliff and they 're fine . they don 't fall until they look down ? My mum always said that was the secret of life . Never look down . But it 's more than that . It 's not just about not looking . It 's about not ever realizing that you 're in the middle of the air and you don 't know how to fly . Whatever they did to me ... Killed all the members of my crew . I don 't know why it didn 't kill me . I tried to run from it , but ... Then they started taking Jesse . They seem more interested ... In him now than in me . You 're talking about the tumours ? They are not tumours . They are something that they put in our heads . Possibly . It 's a shame we can 't take a closer look . The doctors tell me they 're lodged in an inoperable spot . If someone put them in , then someone ought to be able to take them out . We could take them out , son , but it would kill you . ( chuckles ) You have a very brave son ... to be willing to go head-on at danger , to fly blind . You should be proud of him . It 's not like they left us much of a choice . Still , you 're a very brave young man . A little foolish , but very brave . You go right at a thing . The initiative , for example , with which you found me . We are , for reasons I 'm sure you both can imagine , a highly sensitive and secret group . People are as worked up as they are right now over a couple of Russian missiles in Cuba , imagine how they 'd react to a sky full of flying saucers . And so we have officers out in the field . Their cover is as regular military officers , but their real job is to screen the stories that come to us , separate the wheat from the chaff . You mean Lieutenant Wylie works for you ? Wylie . Yes , he 's one of ours . Your son did the right thing by coming to us . We can help you . What do you make of this ? You are familiar with the work Dr Watson and Crick are doing now , for which they won the Nobel Prize ? - Yeah . Genetics , yeah . - That 's what this is about . Traits that run in families . Our friends are looking for something . In the Keys family , they have found at least some part of whatever it is they 're looking for . And the tumours ? Perhaps it is some unfortunate by-product of being taken into an alien environment , or perhaps it is something that 's put there for a purpose . It could be , for example , something as simple as a tracking device that allows them to know where the test subjects that are most important to them are . - We should find out more . - Definitely . ( klaxon sounds ) Where are Erickson and Bowen ? Any word ? I haven 't been able to ascertain that , sir . You don 't have much of a future . Anyone ever tell you that ? What 's happening here ? We 've just been put on Defcon 2 , sir . We 're preparing for attack . I knew that Ivy League idiot Kennedy was gonna cause trouble . I would have bet you dollars to donuts . You feel good now ? Are you rested ? Well-fed ? Never better . You want to tell me why you were sitting in the middle of nowhere , staring into space ? We were looking for the northern lights . You can 't see the northern lights this time of year . We were misinformed . What the hell 's going on here ? You know about Cuba ? Is that why you guys are up here ? HOWARD : I didn 't say that . - You ever play football ? - TROOPER : Sure . You send your man deep , defence moves to cover him , a hole opens up , you just walk right on through . You think the Russians are coming through the back door here ? Is that what you 're saying ? I 'm not saying a thing . Just asking if you ever played football . None of this explains what the two of you were doing staring out your windshield at nothing . Nope . It doesn 't , does it ? You all right ? What did that kid do to us ? I think we got a little taste of why Colonel Crawford was so afraid of him . ( engine turns over ) ( engine turns off ) Jacob 's in the backseat . We were followed . Jacob stopped them . Jacob did ? Is he all right ? He 's in a lot better shape than they are . Jake ? Hi . He 's a very special boy . Take care of him . Hey , Jake . ( soldiers chattering ) You 've seen them , haven 't you ? Mr Keys , should you be up and around ? I saw it in your eyes . You 've seen them . Can I fix you a drink ? I 'm here to make sure you don 't hurt my son . Hurt your son ? You want the things they put in our heads . You can have mine . Take it out . Do whatever you have to do . But it ends there , and I want your word ... You 'll never do anything to my son . Yes . I 've seen them . I would think you 'd be more concerned with what they might do to Jesse than with anything that could happen because of us . I don 't know how to stop them . But you think I need stopping , and you think you can do that , Mr Keys . We would never do anything to harm a private citizen . We would never do anything to a citizen against his will . I personally would never do anything to harm a child ! - How old is Jesse ? - 1 6 . - Okay , a young man , then . - Do we have a deal ? In the war , you enlisted in the Air Corps , am I right ? Thank you for volunteering to help your country again . Mum ? Yeah , I 'm all right . Mum , I 'm with Dad . He didn 't take me , Mum . I went to see him . It was my idea . I don 't know when I 'll be back . Mum , I love you . I 'll be all right . I gotta go . You got too much trust for people , kid . That 's your problem . That 's the boy . I saw the lieutenant here give him specific figures- - numbers , types of planes , payloads . At the time , I didn 't realize what they were doing , but when the Defcon order came through ... You tricked me . You were supposed to help us . You tricked me . - Kind of young to be a spy . - JESSE : Spy ? What the hell are you talking about ? You were supposed to help me and my father ! What about the flying saucers ? What about the UFOs ? Must be hopped up on something to give him the nerve to do what he tried to do . I just pray he didn 't manage to deliver his information . I 'll notify the Pentagon , let them know we may have a breach . Where 's my father ? I want to see my father ! You look at three things on the commodities page , like the price of poultry , cottonseed oil , and tin . This is what I did , and all three of them are stable . And this is how you tell there isn 't gonna be a war ? What do they serve you in the army ? Chicken . What does that chicken come out of ? A tin can . - What is that chicken sitting in ? - Cottonseed oil . Yeah , all right , so in a war situation , you have more soldiers- - HENDERSON : Eating more canned chicken . My point exactly . - That doesn 't wash . - Of course it washes . What the hell , it doesn 't wash ? This is the nuclear age . They drop a bomb , nobody 's eating anything . End of story . What do you think ? Is this the nuclear age , or what ? Where 's Colonel Crawford ? Why--why isn 't he here ? I don 't know a Colonel Crawford . Think this thing will go all night ? 'Cause if we 're still here in daylight , there 's a sweet little Studebaker over there I wouldn 't mind taking a look at . Good evening , Mr Keys . Thank you for letting us take a closer look at that tumour of yours . Where 's Crawford ? Colonel Crawford has an entire operation to oversee . He 's left this particular phase of it in my capable hands . Well , I don 't do anything until I talk to Crawford . I need to know that my son is safe . I might be mistaken , but it does not appear to me that you are in a position here to make demands . Prep him . Aah ! You stay away from my boy ! DOCTOR : Scalpel . What is it ? Doctor , he 's seizing ! What 's going on with the anaesthesia ? SOLDIER : Tin and cottonseed oil . - Tin and cottonseed oil ! - DOCTOR : A retractor now ! Tin and cottonseed oil ! What the hell 's going on here ? Tin and cottonseed oil . I want a puppy for Christmas ! Tin and cottonseed oil ! ( laughing hysterically ) Tin and cottonseed oil . Alle ihre erinnerungen kommen auf einmal . Alle ihre erinnerungen und alle ihre aengste . ( doorbell rings ) Tom ? Becky ? And you must be Jacob . Jake 's a little tired . Come in . Come in . We 've been waiting for you ever since Dr Greenspan got in touch with us . They seem like really nice people . We wish you could come home with us , Jake . Do you still do card tricks ? No . Kinda gave that up after we made you disappear . You gonna be all right ? I just need some rest . I 'll be fine . Well , listen ... try not to ... do anything . We don 't want any stories getting out about you . You don 't have to worry about that . I can 't do that stuff anymore . What do you mean ? Well , I guess it 's kinda like a battery that runs out of charge . I know I didn 't have much left , but ... those men were going to hurt Dr Greenspan . I couldn 't let that happen . You take care , Jake . You , too . We can start with , " Where the hell were you , " and work our way up from there . You told us to bring you a smoking gun . We were following a lead . A schoolteacher in Montana claimed she 'd been taken . And ? Dead end . Just another lonely lady looking for a little attention . I hope you were able to give her some . Well , there were a few stories up there . I wouldn 't mind getting back up there to take another look around . I 'm sure you wouldn 't . ( chuckling ) We had an interesting time of it while you were gone . There 's a classified report you both should take a look at . Alle ihre erinnerungen kommen auf einmal . Alle ihre erinnerungen und alle ihre aengste . " All your memories play at once . " " All your memories and all your fears . " Howard , you stay a moment ? I need your help with something at home . It 's a personal thing . Something going on with Marty ? How do you mean ? He feels to me like someone about to try an end run . Keep an eye on him . I rely on you completely . You 're my eyes and ears out there , Howard . Yes , sir . What happened ? Russians shot down one of our U-2s . Bad time to be a spy , kid . Time of war , they shoot you . - JESSE : What 's this ? - Bomb shelter . - Why ? - Like they 're going to tell me . Hey , did you hear about Henderson and Slide ? They 're escorting a patient from the hospital , some sort of secret surgery . Something went wrong . Big explosion . Everyone 's dead . The patient from the hospital , do you know his name ? Was I talking to you ? Do you know the name of the man they were transporting ? Who was he ? I don 't know his name . Whoever he was , he 's dead . ALLIE : The world is made up of the big things that happen and the small ones . And the part that 's so unfair is that we call them " big " and " small . " because when something happens to you . when you lose something or someone that you really care about . that 's all there is . The world may be blowing up around you . but you don 't care about that . You don 't care about that at all . - What are you looking for ? - Evidence . What do you mean ? Sam , you 're your father 's favourite . You know that ? You always were . I hope it doesn 't ruin your life . That 's it . His favourite . Your birthday . 7-28-51 . What is it ? Part of your inheritance . Your mother and I need to talk . Come on . Out . Out . Come on . ( door closes ) My father told me about this . It 's from that spaceship . What do you mean ? What spaceship ? The one that you and daddy found up at Pine Lodge . He said you used this to take the project away from him . You know , it broke his heart when he lost the program . I think that 's what killed him . Your father had a drinking problem , Anne . He imagined things . What killed him was cirrhosis of the liver . You know that . ( chuckles ) I 'm an intelligence officer , Anne . I 've never had anything to do with any kind of spaceship . You 're lying . You 're a liar ! What you 're holding is a piece of an experimental plane the Air Force is working on . I thought I 'd get it mounted it for Sam . He seems to like that sort of thing . Oh , God . Anne , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so single-minded in my work . I don 't ... I don 't give you enough . You or the boys . Remember the first time I took you riding ? You almost fell off . I want it to be like that again for us . It 's the most important thing in the world to me , Anne . Please forgive me . Please say you 'll give me one more chance , okay ? Anne ... Anne , we need to do something about the pills and the liquor . It 's ... You know that . We can 't go on like this . There 's a place in Oregon . It 's very comfortable and very discreet . It 's a six-week program , and I 've made some calls . You can leave tonight . Okay ? It 's best for the boys . And we 'll all be here waiting for you when you get back . Okay ? I 'm sorry . Come here . Howard . Thanks for coming . You can understand I wanted to keep this , you know ... close ? I truly appreciate you doing this for me and for my family . Well , I 'm happy to help out , Colonel . And , uh , slow and easy on the curves . My wife 's in a delicate state , okay ? Anne , Howard 's here . Ma 'am . I 'll take that , sir . You 'll tell the boys I love them ? Yes , I 'll tell them , and I 'll tell them you 're going to be just fine . And when you come home , we 'll go riding again , okay ? Okay . See you soon , okay ? - Bye . - Bye . ( engine starts ) RADIO ANNOUNCER : In a climax to what many see as the biggest threat since the bombing of Pearl Harbour . the Soviets have agreed to remove their missiles in Cuba if the United States promises not to invade the island . This brings to an end ... I guess we came pretty close to glowing in the dark . I guess we did . You won 't live long if you 're in that kind of hurry . ANNE : I know . I wonder where he 's going so fast . Would you rather hear some music ? - Yeah , I think so . Do you mind ? - No , not at all . Let 's see what we 've got . ( Brenda Lee sings I Want to Be Wanted ) - Yeah , leave it there . - That 's not too bad . # My lonely heart knows how # # I want to be wanted # What the hell is that ? # Right now # # Not tomorrow # # But right now # # I want to be wanted # Colonel . # I want someone to share my love with # # And my dreams with # ( gunshot ) # Someone I know I 'd love to spend # # A million years with # Aah ! # Where is this someone # # Somewhere # ( gunshot ) # Meant for me ? # # Alone # # Just my lonely heart # # Knows how # # I want to be wanted # # Right now # # Not tomorrow . but right now # You probably won 't believe me , sweetheart , but I 'm ... # I want to be wanted # I 'm really sorry about this . # I want someone ... # ( gunshot ) # Someone I know I 'd love to spend # # A million years with # # Where is this someone # # Somewhere # # Meant for me ? # # Meant for me ? # ( Bob Dylan sings See that My Grave is Kept Clean ) # And there 's two white horses following me # # I got two white horses following me # # Waiting on my burying ground # # Did you ever hear that coffin sound ? # # Did you- - # I have some terrible news . Sometimes grownups , married grownups , get the idea that they don 't want to be married anymore . And they start to see other people . Something like that has happened with your mother . Do you remember Captain Bowen who worked for me ? Howard , sure . He and your mother have been seeing each other . Apparently , last night , they decided to go away together . They were in Howard 's car , going up over the Sierras . The police don 't know exactly how it happened . It looks as if your mother changed her mind about leaving us . And Howard tried to stop her , and ... Look , sometimes when grownups care about something ... Things can get a little confused . ( voice breaking ) She 's gone , boys . ( sobbing ) I 'm so sorry . She 's gone . She 's go- - She was the sun and the moon to me . I 'm so sorry . ALLIE : I have this idea about why people do the terrible things they do . Same reason little kids push each other on the schoolyard . If you 're the one doing the pushing . then you 're not going to be the one who gets pushed . If you 're the monster . then nothing will be waiting in the shadows to jump out at you . It 's pretty simple. really . People do the terrible things they do because they 're scared . That 's all we found in the wreckage . Bodies and this film . Russell Keys ' body ? Missing the piece of skull the surgeon cut out , yes . Any sign of the thing they put in his head ? Forensics people tell me there was a tiny hole in Russell Keys ' frontal lobe where this thing could 've been lodged , but , no ... It must 've been destroyed in the fire . After first doing this to a room full of people . Huh . You 're probably wondering why I wasn 't in that room . Over the years , Marty , I 've found that I have good gut , a little twinge that tells me when I might do better to be cautious . One of the luxuries of being in charge , you get a twinge like that , you can have other people take your risks . Marty , I appreciate your loyalty in all this . I 'm not gonna forget you . Now that Howard 's gone , you 're gonna be in a position of much greater responsibility . I hope you 're up to the challenge . Yes , sir . What was he looking for in Montana ? What did he think he could find there that he could use against me ? He thought that Jacob Clarke was still alive . Was he ? No . Are you going to show this film to the president ? No . ( chuckles ) No . No , I don 't think so . Now that he 's saved the world , the son of a bitch is gonna be even more insufferable . You really think he 'll shut us down ? Or make us pencil pushers . - So what do we do ? - We just bide our time . Keep the other one on ice . Jesse Keys ? Yeah . The doctors tell me the thing in his head is identical to the one in his father 's . We just bide our time and keep him on ice . That pretty boy won 't be president forever . These , uh--I was told these were your old man 's . ALLIE : We 're all standing on the edge of a cliff . all the time. every day . a cliff we 're all going over . Our choice isn 't about that . Our choice is about whether we want to go kicking and screaming or whether we might want to open our eyes and our hearts to what happens once we start to fall . ( scratching sounds ) Dad ! Dad ! ALLIE : What makes us human ? That we can think ? That we can feel sorrow and pain ? Maybe . That we can laugh ? I hope so . We can hurt and we can laugh and we know a past and a present . And. in some ways. a future . Maybe what makes us human is that we know just enough to think we know where we 're going . # Turn around , go back down , back the way you came # # Can 't you see that flash of fire , brighter than the day ? # ( horn honks ) Come on , Manny , let 's go . Wow . This could be big . We get these reports two , three times a week . Mutilated cattle , dancing lights , the sort of thing we 're about to look at . For you to come personally , you must have some reason . The reports look good . First one came in from a local pilot out of Gary , then a commercial airline en route to Chicago . This could finally be your proof , Dad . I mean , this could finally show the threat is real . We already know that , don 't we ? Don 't try so hard , kid . Just do a good job . Your old man 'll come around . Keep these people back ! Keep them back . Stay back , folks . Out of the way , please . Stay back , folks . MAN : We may need that . You never know what 's out there . SECOND MAN : Looks like a reporter . MAN : Notify dispatch ... Reports are all good , Bob . This is real . It 's a landing strip . I 'd stake my career on it . Yes , tell the President , and tell him I believe it signals that our friends will soon be here in force . I really think you should look at this personally . Thank you , Bob . Thank you . - The President 's on his way . - That 's great news . Why don 't you ... go help out with crowd control or something . ( chattering ) ( soldier shouts out orders to crowd ) Colonel Crawford . Toby Woodruff . This is Ted Olson . Where 's the President ? Mr Olson is with the NSA . I 'm with Defence . The President felt you 'd be better off dealing with the ... the " hands-on " guys . The " hands-on " guys ? You been briefed ? Let 's go for a little ride , and we 'll see how you feel . Look at that . This has happened before , here and France , England , and Germany . The scale of this , the intent . Look at the formation . It 's like a runway . Like a landing strip ? If it 's a landing strip , that means they could be- - Landing ? Think Nixon stands a chance at a second term ? My opinion , he 'd have to fix the next election . No one likes the creep . Truman was President when I started this project . I 've survived four of them . Nixon will make five . I 've lasted this long because I know how to ruin the people who get in my way . What I want you puppies to do is get on the phone and make the President know he has to be here immediately . This is a threat to our country of unparalleled proportions . You do that for me , because long after Richard Nixon is just a faded memory , I 'll be around to make your lives a living hell . Looks like there 's another one here . ( creaking ) ( raven caws ) ( caw caw ) Dr Powell , we 've got something . Very nice , Buzz . It 's in remarkable condition . Where 'd you find it ? North six , west twelve . - Where we found the drums ? - And there 's more . Let 's go check it out . ( raven caws ) Do you think we could be onto a smoke hut ? Something the shaman used to drive out evil spirits ? Yeah , possibly . Sarah 's back on the demons again . That 's why we came here in the first place , isn 't it ? Rumours of demons in the woods . The places that the Russian settlers wouldn 't go . Places that people still won 't go ? That and 80 years of research into the Tsimshian people . Dr Powell . Yeah . What 's up , Daryl ? I found something . Oh , yeah . I don 't think it 's a smokehut . Looks to me more like a funeral potlatch . The drums , the bowls , the raven to take the spirit into the next world . We 're all dead . First , there 's the demons , then we open up a tomb . We 're toast . Remind me , what are these demons supposed to be doing ? They 're a native version of the legend of the Incubus and Succubus . They would take people from their homes to the woods , and sometimes , the women would come back pregnant . Sometimes , they don 't come back at all . Daryl , you okay ? I 'm hurt , man . Here . Buzz , grab a ladder . How you doing , buddy ? I landed bad . I twisted my ankle . We 'll get you out . Don 't worry . What the ... Oh , my God . Sir . Yes ? 23 years . What are you going to do ? Learn to fly-fish . For what it 's worth ... I think you got a raw deal . I tell my doctor I 'm worried about my heart , my blood pressure . He tells me to take these pills and to go fly-fishing . Apparently there 's something soothing about hooking a fish , looking at them , then letting them go . What about Jesse Keys ? My smoking gun . 16-year-old boy with something put in his head by our friends . You and I both know we 're never gonna find him . He disappeared from that bomb shelter and fell off the planet . I 'll tell you something . I 've never known what our friends were up to , not a clue . Roswell , taking all these people . But the way they took Jesse Keys ... whatever they 're doing , we don 't stand a damn chance against them . Is there something else ? I was just wondering where to put the desk . I guess they didn 't want to go outside the project . They put me in charge . Great . Then you can look for Jesse Keys . ALLIE : I asked my dad once about his dad. my grandfather . I knew he 'd had some hard times . But I didn 't know a lot more than that . I said to my dad . " I guess maybe he was kind of lost . " " Not lost. really . " my dad said . but for a while . he was definitely bewildered . " # I hope to get home all right # # Hey , Mr Spaceman # # Won 't you please take me along ? # # I won 't do anything wrong # # Hey , Mr Spaceman ... # What 's the weirdest thing you ever saw ? And acid trips don 't count . I saw this two-headed snake once at the zoo in San Diego . And one time , man ... I think I saw a flying saucer . I 've been on a flying saucer , more than once . One time , I saw my father . He 'd been dead ... for four days . Okay , my man . Now , that is really and truly weird . A waste of friggin ' time and money , going to the moon . You know what I admired about you back when we were over there ? I was in four different units while I was in ' Nam , and you were the only one . What do you mean , " only one " ? Officer who walked point . Every single mission , you walked point . At first , I thought it was just ' cause you was crazy ... Then maybe because you were the best guy in the whole world . Or maybe because you 'd seen something that was ... something other than that Ring of Hell that we were in . It was because I was the best guy in the world . See , now , me ? I believe in everything . You tell me there 's aliens or that you 've gone for a ride on a saucer ... sure , why not ? You tell me they killed the Kennedys or started the war , and I am with you 1 00 % % . But what I 'm sorry to hear is ... Is that your experience was so bad that you could do what we did without even flinching . I don 't know what my experience was . All I know is , my whole life is like that- - walking point through a jungle , waiting for something that ... I can 't stop to happen to me . No disrespect , but how does that make you any different than anybody else ? How 's my credit ? Sorry , but there 's nothing I can do in that regard . Willie , I saved your life . Come on . Two times . Now I 'm gonna save yours . Get straight . I don 't wanna get straight , Willie . I wanna get high . I know , you want to get taken to that other world . Well , that costs money . I 'm good for it . You 're not good for nothing , same as every other junkie I do business with . That is why I am strictly cash-and-carry . Get straight , and I 'd be happy never to see your face ever again . If you get some money , then I 'd be happy to accommodate you . ( train passes by ) ( church bell chimes ) ( children laughing ) We 're expecting a telegram . From Los Angeles , California ? Your telling me again doesn 't make it get here any quicker . You 're the people that are digging in the woods ? Yeah . What are you looking for ? Do you know about the Indians who used to live out here ? A little bit . We 're trying to find out more about them . It 's five even . You gonna be getting the hell out of there any time soon ? Why are you people so hostile ? We 're not doing anything . You got a home with a backyard ? I got a backyard , yeah . You go outside , people digging potholes all over the yard , maybe digging up things better left buried , how are you gonna feel about it ? Thanks . ( door closes ) NEWSCASTER : Apollo 1 3 got into trouble shortly after 1 0 . 00 eastern time last night . Something happened which cut off the power and oxygen supply in the command ship . At midnight. the astronauts were told to use the moon-landing ship . At 3 . 42 a. m .. they were ordered to make the critical firing to put the mission in an orbit ... Do you think this was an accident ? If I had to weigh our friends ' propensity to interfere against NASA 's growing incompetence , I think I 'd have to go with NASA . ... made their last television broadcast to earth . SECOND MAN : Last night . after 1 0 p. m. eastern standard time ... What ? Nothing . If you were still in charge , you would have used this as further proof of that imminent invasion . Probably . ( doorbell rings ) ... the hypothesis for Houston at this point is that it may have been caused by a collision with a meteoroid or an explosion on the aircraft ... - Sam . - Hey , Dad . What a surprise . What the hell are you doing here ? Dad said he lost his job . Right . Like you care about that . What do you want , Sam ? How 's Julie ? She 's pregnant . What do you want ? Pregnant . Well , congratulations . You came home to gloat , didn 't you ? You came home because he lost the organization . You still think he 's some sort of a god , don 't you ? He craps on you for 21 years , you keep coming back for more . - You don 't know what you 're saying . - I 'm talking about lies , Eric . I 'm talking about this . A guy named Tom Clarke says he devoted his life to exposing the government UFO hoax . People see something strange in the sky , the government makes them think it 's a UFO , not some secret plane . People taken in the middle of the night and filled full of mind-altering drugs . Must have been cosmic visitors . It sure wasn 't our government testing some new chemical weapon . Is that our legacy , Eric ? Is that what he 's been doing- - covering for these creeps ? OWEN : What creeps ? Tom Clarke . I should have known . You know him ? Our paths have crossed . I spent a lifetime building my organization . - With one prank , he took it away . - It wasn 't the prank . It 's the times . Nobody cares about this science-fiction stuff . Real monsters are running this country , killing innocent people . Oh , right , son . There were no monsters in my generation . No killing . You 're my son ! This is your inheritance he took ! I don 't want any part of that . - Then why did you come home ? - I was asking the same question . If you don 't give a damn , why did you come home ? ( sliding door opens ) What is it ? Part of your inheritance . Is it true ? Are you really in charge of some UFO project ? No. absolutely not . Guess I could have changed the combination , but ... I always thought when you were ready , you 'd come home . I found this at a crash site in New Mexico . What crashed was nothing man-made . Inside this craft were five beings . They were not human . Three of them were dead , the fourth one died under observation , and the fifth ... Everything I 've done since I found this wreckage has been about this- - trying to understand who they are and what they wanted . I was wrong about the crop circles , but I 'm not wrong about this . Something is about to happen . Maybe next week , maybe in 30 years , but these visitors--they 're moving towards something . It 's really true , isn 't it ? Dad , you had no right to hide the truth like that . Do you know what would 've happened in 1 947 if the country had believed we were about to be attacked from outer space ? I don 't know , the growth of a military-industrial complex ? Senate hearings to determine if you were or had been an alien sympathizer ? Maybe we would have started to invade countries we thought succumbed to the menace . I can 't abide a mess . And what about now ? You 've kept this from the world for 23 years , Dad . Don 't you think it 's time you told the truth ? I 've only been frightened once in my adult life . Would you like me to tell you about that time ? That fifth one ... the survivor of the crash that was never accounted for ... I tracked him down to a small town in Texas . He had formed a bond there with a young woman , And years later , I went back to that town . The woman was not that young then . She had two grown children , and she also had a 1 0-year-old son , the result of her bond with this stranger . Her older son Tom is the one who made that crop circle . He did it deliberately to destroy me . Well , I guess he had his reasons . I got close to the Clarkes . I wanted to know more about the younger boy--Jacob . I was bringing him back to the ranch when it happened . He was a strange boy . He was gentle , and he was withdrawn . When I looked in this boy 's eyes , Sam , what I saw- - what I saw there was all my memories and all my fears . More than that , I saw them add up . Do you understand ? I saw my own death , Sam . I saw how I would die . Maybe it was a moment of guilt . You know , maybe what you saw ... Is what you know you deserve . Well , there 's your story , son . Your big scoop . A Pulitzer while you 're still an undergraduate . And all you have to do is make someone believe you . ( chattering ) Hi . Do you know where I can find some information on the dig site ? Yeah , I do . Who are you ? Oh . Sam Crawford . Sarah . How 're you doing ? I 'm a journalism student from UC Berkeley . Uh , Dr Powell ? This is Sam Crawford . He 's a journalism student . - Nice to meet you . - How you doing ? - Is that the carbon-dating report ? - Yeah . Well , how old 's our body ? It 's about ... six years old , give or take . Yeah . The wrappings are bed sheets . They date back to the early 1 960s . Lab estimates 1 964 , but they can 't tell for sure . We should 've known . There was nothing Tsimshian about the burial . They never wrap their dead . The glyphs were indecipherable , not their language at all . Actually , I was hoping I could talk to you about that . What did you make of the writings you found in the burial chamber ? It was no language we 've been able to identify . Yeah , probably no more real than our mummy . I gotta go find the sheriff . Sam , you 're welcome to stick around . - Thanks . - Okay . ALLIE : I remember my mum telling me that she only went to church once with her mother on Easter Sunday . When the minister said that the kingdom of heaven was within her . that scared her half to death . It meant it was all up to her . People want the comfort of strong arms . They look to the voices in their heads. to drugs . They look to the sky . - Hey . - Hey . I can see you didn 't take my advice about getting clean , so I have to say to myself ... maybe the man 's got some money . I got these . What are they ? They 're my dad 's medals . What the hell are you doing ? - Get a doctor . - MAN : Right away . I want you people packed up and out of here by tomorrow morning . Sheriff , we 've got to be able to come to some sort of compromise . This is a significant archaeological dig . I don 't care . I want you gone . Where 's the mummy ? Can I ask you something ? You say this mummy might be evidence of a murder . That 's generally the case when somebody hides the body . Then aren 't you supposed to say , " Don 't leave town , " instead of , " Get out of town by sunrise " ? You find that helps you as you make your way through life ? Being a wise-ass ? DARYL : Hey , Dr Powell ? The mummy was here just a minute ago . Well , it didn 't just get up and walk off by itself , now , did it ? Hey , look at this . ( thunder ) ( raven caws ) Mosquitoes starting early this year , huh , George ? Hmm ... I read somewhere that mosquitoes have killed more people In the history of the world , the way they spread disease and all , than all the wars , famines , and floods put together . Hard to believe something like that . I don 't know why I buy this stuff . It doesn 't work at all . Champ ! Champ ! Champ ! Champ . Champ . You know what I like to do for mosquitoes ? I like to get garlic and motor oil and rub it all over any part of me that 's gonna be exposed . I never have any trouble with the little bloodsuckers . Bye , Louise . Honey , would you put ... Wendy ? Wendy ? Wendy ? Wendy ? Wendy , l- - Wendy . Wendy ! Wendy ! Wendy ! Wendy ! ( raven cawing ) Wendy ! Wendy ! She knows not to go in the woods . She has been told , and she has been told . Louise , it 's gonna be all right . Kids wander off all the time . We find them . Not in these woods . DR POWELL : They walk among us in many shapes , and their ways are not always what we would hope . So to understand that which is not you , you must become that other thing . My grandmother said , " Walk a mile in another man 's shoes . " That is the greatest secret to shape-shifting . So it 's not about the disguise , it 's about knowledge . You guys really gonna leave in the morning ? Well , we really don 't have much of a choice . It was a good dig , sir . Even without the body , you 've done some important work here . We were only just getting started . Yeah . Nature call . - Not very subtle , are they ? - Nah . You really wanna look at the writing on the wall ? - Yeah . - Let 's go . - Daryl , you wanna join us ? - Okay . You sure you wanna do this ? I 'm not a virgin , if that 's what you mean . I 'm not talking about that . I 'm saying , you sure you wanna wander into the deep , dark woods when there 's something out there ? What do you think happened ? Tana leaves . The curse . He 's been revived . He 's coming for you , Sarah . Cut it out . That 's not funny . ( kissing ) Dr Powell , is the raven considered a trickster or a shape-shifter ? Daryl , are you looking for a grade here , or do you really want to know ? A little bit of both . All right . Fair enough . Trickster is both good and bad . He brings man knowledge of the universe as it is . - Do you understand that ? - Yeah . Okay , so Jack Tales and Loki and Daffy Duck are all examples of trickster gods . What could be trickier than shape-shifting ? Right . Like when Daffy pretended to be a skunk . That was Sylvester , and he spilled paint on his back , but , yeah , you get the point . Wow . You sure that wasn 't Daffy ? Because the duck , he 's always getting into something . I get the feeling this all means something to you . ( Sarah screams ) Stay here and watch our stuff . Where are they ? Let 's check up here . You want to get that light out of my face ? Sorry . - These two belong to you ? - Yeah . You okay ? She 's fine , but if you 're gonna be so jumpy you scream in the face of every old man you meet , you shouldn 't be walking in the woods in the middle of the night . Trickster . The trickster . ( makes cawing noises ) Dr Powell ? I was just messing around , man . Hello ? Buzz ? This isn 't funny , man . ( branch snaps ) Hello ? Dr Powell ? Dr Powell ? RADIO : The safe return of the Apollo 1 3 astronauts who splashed down in the Pacific near the USS Iwo Jima . The astronauts were immediately flown by helicopter to the Iwo Jima , where a medical doctor examined them . President Nixon watched the final moments of the Apollo 1 3 on TV and then announced that he will fly to Houston to pick up families of the astronauts and continue on to Hawaii where he will award the astronauts with the Medal of Freedom . - How are you feeling today , Frank ? - Better . Feeling better . Miss ? Miss , I got this itch that really needs scratching . You slept through the night . - First time . - I know . Thought you might be up for some solid food . I 've got something solid right here . Looks like Johnson 's hungry . Hungry ? Aah ! Aah ! No , no . Do they still have those guys in the park who sell hot dogs ? Uh-huh . DR POWELL : But , sheriff , Daryl 's vanished . He 's been gone all night . Is he a citizen of Haysport ? No , he 's not . So his disappearance is not my problem . - What do you mean , not your problem ? - Who are you ? I 'm Sam Crawford . I 'm a reporter . I 'm doing a story on the dig . Not anymore , you 're not . Look , sheriff , last night , there was an old man prowling the woods with a shotgun . One of my students has disappeared , and you 're not going to do anything ? Tell you what--you file a report ... I 'll keep my eyes open . Right . It 's starting again , Kerby . Isn 't it ? ( laughter ) ALLIE : When you 're a kid . anything can take you away- - soap bubbles or a hose spraying a rainbow up over a new-mowed lawn . I guess growing up means that it gets harder and harder to find your way back to that kind of place where you can be taken . The one time I see grownups with that same sort of look on their faces is when they 're just at first falling in love . It changed a lot while you were away , huh ? I wasn 't really thinking about that . I was just thinking about all those bubbles . They 're beautiful , aren 't they ? Yeah . Those kids look really happy . What happened ? A lot of things . - In the war ? - I don 't know . That was just the icing on my cake . ( screams ) No ! Get your kids out of here ! What do you want from me ? ! Why do you keep taking me ? ! Why did you save me in the jungle ? ! Why didn 't you let me die with my men ? ! Frank ! Frank ! Jeez , man . Lighten up . It 's not my war . Come on . Oh , my God . Man can 't make a damn bubble in the modern world . Come on . It 's okay . Frank . Frank . Hey , it 's okay . You can tell me . My name 's Amelia , for God 's sake . I was named after somebody who was lost . Can I ask you to do something for me ? Would you call me Jesse instead of Frank ? Frank 's not my real name . Maybe someday I can explain . Excuse me , miss . I 'm looking for Lieutenant Frank Pierce . Ridley , Personnel Services Office . Records Branch . You 're a difficult man to find . - I 've been sort of preoccupied . - You never picked up your medals . I have a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart . - Keep ' em . - Excuse me ? Give them to someone who deserves them . - You don 't want them ? - I don 't want ' em . Okay . I read the report on this , lieutenant . What you did- - it 's a miracle you survived . The temple was on fire . You couldn 't save everyone . I don 't know if you blame yourself for the men you couldn 't save , if that 's what this is about- - It 's about that and a lot of other things . I 'm not gonna take your medals . Well , we 'll just add that to the list . The list of things you 're gonna explain to me someday . You like it , being a nurse ? I was in college . I knew everything that was wrong with the world . I wasn 't doing one little thing to make it better . What about you ? Did you always want to be a soldier ? I always figured I 'd be a mechanic , like my dad . - What happened ? - We 're different in that way . I stopped thinking I could fix things . ( horn honking ) WOMAN : Look out ! You okay , buddy ? Steve , you little idiot ! What were you doing ? Why don 't you think ? Ma 'am , I think he 's scared enough . - Thank you . - Yeah . - You okay ? - Yeah . You 're very brave . No , I 'm not . It 's not brave when you know nothing can hurt you . What do you mean ? Someone 's watching over you ? You got a guardian angel or something ? Or something . Is that what happened in Vietnam , Jesse ? You thought you couldn 't get hurt ? No . I knew I couldn 't get hurt . We were in the Quang Ngai province , and ... we walked into a trap . Knowing what I knew , knowing that I was safe ... I should 've been able to do more . I dared them the whole time , saying , " Go ahead . Get me out of this one . " And they did . They got me out . And they let 27 men from my unit die . Who are " they " , Jesse ? Who are you talking about ? Add that to your list , too . Okay , guys . The only way to cover enough ground before nightfall is to split up . Any problems , blow your whistles . Keep blowing until the rest of us can get to where you are . Sam 's offered to help us look . One more thing- - someone has to stay here , just in case Daryl comes back while we 're out looking for him . I will . Thanks , Sarah . You might want to keep this . Let 's go , you guys . Be safe . Daryl ! Daryl ! Daryl , it 's Dr Powell . Daryl ? Daryl ! Daryl ! Daryl . ( caws ) Daryl . ( footsteps ) Hello ? Is anybody there ? Hello ? Daryl ! You in there ? Hello ? Any word yet ? Nobody 's been back ? This is deeply creepy . Yeah . Deeply . Look , I better go back out . You wanna take this ? You should keep it . Okay . Okay . ( twig cracks ) ( whistle blows ) DR POWELL : Aahhh ! ( gunshots ) ( sobbing and whimpering ) You take care of the problem ? Yeah . He 'd just gotten to Powell when I came on him . I shot him twice . No body ? There was blood all over . I figured he 'd crawled away to die . You figure , or you hope ? Come on , doc . I told you , I shot him twice . You didn 't want to make sure , just in case you were wrong ? What are you looking at , old man ? You ain 't helping , creeping around the woods . You 're damn lucky you 're still alive ! I need some help ! Somebody help me , please . It 's okay . Shock . Nothing more . She probably won 't remember a thing . Well , let 's hope not . What 's going on here , sheriff ? What paper did you say you worked for again ? Well ... it 's a college newspaper . Uh-huh . Well ... next time an officer of the law makes a suggestion to you , like " Go Away , " for example , you should think about listening . If I see you again , I 'm gonna drive you out into the woods , and I am gonna shoot you . Go away . SARAH : His eyes ... He came through the burial chamber ... His eyes ... oh , God . His eyes . ( twig cracks ) You 're all right . When I found you , I thought you might be dead . Then I noticed you were still breathing , so I ... I dragged you in here to keep you out of the elements and such . Who the hell are you ? My name 's Leo . My daughter 's name was Nadine . She would 've been 40 this year . We got the northern lights up here , but in 1 958 , there was something in the sky that wasn 't any aurora borealis . There were these lights in the sky ... dancing , moving in ways you wouldn 't believe , coming down out of the sky and disappearing into the woods . My Nadine went walking in there , trying to see what they were . She came back a day and a half later , no idea where she 'd been , no idea what had happened to her . It was about four months after that she started to show . The twins were born in early ' 59 . The pregnancy was hard , real hard , and the birth killed her . I was Nadine 's only family , so I took the boys . I named ' em Larry and Lester . They were all wrong , those boys , right from the start , but it wasn 't just that . It was how they looked and what they could do . They could peer inside a fellow , even when they were small . When I looked in this boy 's eyes. what I saw ... what I saw there was all my memories and all my fears . After a little while , it got too hard for us to stay in town . Folks just didn 't want them around , so ... we went out into the woods , stayed in this cabin my father had built for hunting trips- - How much did you tell him , Leo ? Well , doesn 't really matter . We 're gonna take that drive I promised you . ( thunder ) ( hums ) You killed one of the twins , didn 't you ? You killed him , you wrapped him up and stuck him in that chamber . Larry . He was the worst of the two . Took to trying out his abilities when he was 1 6 years old . Leo mention that ? Hmm ? All the dead dogs and cattle ? Things he did to them hunters in the woods . This town makes its living off of hunting season . Close to ten years , couldn 't pay folks to go in our woods . Leo wouldn 't go near that cabin himself . It 's my job to keep this town safe for everybody . That boy was a menace . I went up there to try to talk some sense into him . Anyway , I didn 't wrap him up . I buried him under a tree . How he wound up in that burial pit , wrapped up like that ... I got some ideas . Come on ! Get after him ! KERBY : Damn it ! Where 'd he go ? This way . Come on . ( gasps ) Can you come with me ? Lester ? MAN : It 's the sheriff . Whoa . Whoa . Louise , what the hell is going on ? We 're going in after him , Kerby . My daughter 's still missing , and we know who 's responsible . All right , let 's go . ( shouting ) Over here . She 's hurt bad . Must have tried to climb a tree to see where she was , and she fell . Her leg 's broke in a couple of places . I sneak up when she 's asleep , leave her food and water , but I can 't get her into town . I 'm afraid she 'll look at me . What happens when people look at you ? I don 't know , exactly . When my brother and I were kids ... we used to just scare folks , mostly . I think people look at us , they see too much . All their memories . All their fears . I guess you could say . Why 'd you wrap your brother up like that ? My brother and I ... sometimes ... we would draw in this weird language . We never knew what it meant , but it looked kind of like in books and stuff about ancient Egypt . Yes . I knew it was important , like ... maybe magic or something . I thought maybe if I ... wrapped him up like that , put him somewhere special with that writing all around him ... Maybe he 'd come back to life . Kind of foolish , huh ? No . No , Lester , I don 't think that 's foolish at all . I think you loved your brother very much . I never meant to hurt any of those people who dug up the grave . I was trying to get help for the girl . I know . My , uh ... Whatever it is I do to people ... I guess it got stronger after Larry died . I really never meant for anyone to get hurt . ( groans ) You 're hurt , too . I gotta get you both to a doctor . Just worry about the little girl . Hi . Hi . Are you the one who 's been bringing me food ? No , sweetheart . I 'm not . Is that him over there ? I wanna say thanks . His name 's Lester . You can thank him later , okay ? Right now , I 'm gonna have to pick you up , but it might hurt a little , so can you be brave ? ( mob shouting ) Hey , stop ! The little girl 's here ! She 's all right ! Stop ! Stop pouring the gas ! We 're coming out ! Come on , sweetie . It 's okay . Come on . All right . Mister ? Thank you . You 're welcome . Oh , God . Baby . Oh , my God . Baby , did he do this to you ? No , mummy . I fell out of a tree . Get her back to the car , Louise . We 're gonna finish this once and for all . Why don 't you let me take it from here ? Eric . What are you doing here ? You 're not a hard man to follow , Sam . From everything the sheriff and Dr Shilling have told me , you 've got something important to the project- - some sort of half-breed or something . That 's why you 're here ? I 'm here to keep you from doing anything unfortunate . The sheriff says you 've been uncooperative . Look , there 's nothing here for you . I think I 'd like to see for myself . Eric , you can 't go in there . You 're going to stop me ? You could be killed . You care about me , Sam . I 'm touched . He 's right , son . You don 't want to go in there . - Eric , no . - Get your hands off me ! I 'm not gonna let you take him ! Lester don 't want to hurt anybody . Get out of here . Step away from the porch , Leo . Mummy , are they gonna hurt Lester ? Hush , honey . I let you people take my boys before , and look where it got me . No , sir . I 'm not moving . Well , suit yourself . Come on ! MAN : Get that gasoline on it . Mummy , no ! You want him now , little brother ? He 's all yours . Lester , you gotta get out of here . Larry didn 't mean to hurt anyone , either . They came out with cameras to take pictures of the freaks . Larry just lost his temper . We gotta go ! What 's the point ? Where am I gonna go ? - We 'll figure something out . - You better get out of here . Lester , come on . ( Sam screaming ) Oh , my goodness ! ( baby cooing ) There you go . Grandpa did that , didn 't he ? Yes , you 're very cute . Hi , Mary . Come on . Can you say " grandpa " ? Can you say " grandpa " ? She 's only a week old . Can 't start indoctrinating them too soon . Come on , Mary . " Grandpa . " Come on . " Grandpa . " I wish your brother Sam was here to see this . Say " grandpa . " Come on . Julie , could you give dad and me a minute ? Yeah . I bring my baby over for you to see , you 're still talking about Sam . We haven 't heard from him since he left . We won 't be hearing from him anymore . Sam is dead . What ? He went out trying to find proof that would destroy you , and that proof killed him . He died trying to bring you down . He hated you that much . You never told me any of the things you told Sam . I would never have broken your trust , and you never once gave it to me . This ... is this what you saw when you saw your own death ? ( screaming ) ( heart beating rapidly ) No ! Aah ! A stroke , right ? A massive explosion . " Pop " goes the brain stem . That 's why you always hated me . I scared you . You knew I was the last thing you 'd ever see . Kind of funny , isn 't it ? If you 'd been a little kinder , showed a little more interest , this might not have happened . Knowing what you know- - that 's what brought us here . So , how does it end , Dad ? Are you trapped in there ? Stuck inside your head a while longer before the lights finally all go out ? I always loved you better . You know that . You wet yourself . Marry me . That goes in the kitchen . Master bedroom , please . Thank you . Thank you . Shut the door on your way out . OWEN : Eric . I guess I was wrong about you . Good luck and Godspeed . Dad . # If my words did glow # # With the gold of sunshine # # And my tunes were played # # On the harp unstrung # # Would you hear my voice # # Come through the music ? # # Would you hold it near # # As it were your own ? # # It 's a hand-me-down # # The thoughts are broken # # Perhaps # # They 're better # # Left unsung # # I don 't know # # Don 't really care # ( raven caws ) # Let there be songs to fill the air # # La da da da # # La da da-da da # # La da da da # # La da da da da # My father was a vicious , selfish man who put his personal aggrandizement above the good of his country . In my opinion , his egomania made him a liability to the project . However , he was also incredibly meticulous . He kept files on everything . This one 's interesting , doctor . Your signature on the autopsy reports from the three bodies recovered from the Roswell crash , and a fourth , the one who died while under observation . Two copies of the crash-site reports- - the real one and the cover-up . General , your signature 's on both . An interesting one on the disposal of the bodies of twin psychics used in some early research into the nature of the technology . This one 's particularly informative . It 's a briefing on the Roswell events that you and your colleagues prepared for General Eisenhower just before he took office . On page 2 , you 'll find a list of the 1 2 of you who worked on the briefing . A very impressive group . These are copies , of course . The originals are in a safe place . So what do you want ? Commander . Your briefcase , sir . What 's going on here , Eric ? I checked the motor pool records for the night my mother was killed . You did check that car out . That makes you an accomplice , Marty . An accessory before the fact . These men will hand you over to civilian authorities in Carson City . I 'm sure your fear of my father will be taken into account . And you 'll be stepping up to take over the project ? The acorn doesn 't fall too far , does it , Eric ? I need that funding shifted over to biological research , Ted . Find the resources . Why is it so important ? None of your damn business , Ted . Ted , do your job or lose it . ALLIE : Some people spend their lives hoping for something to happen that will change everything . They look for power or love . or the answers to their biggest questions . I think really what they 're looking for is another chance . some way to lead another life where all the mistakes they 've made would be erased . and they could just start over . Nothing bad has happened yet . and all their possibilities are still in front of them . I 'm sorry I 'm late . That crowd of tourists . We ought to put up a gift shop , sell little bobbing alien heads or something . I had our people take the test subjects out across the desert to avoid them . I can 't run an operation under these conditions . It 's a joke . Since I talked the general into letting me run this project , it 's become a damn circus . But if you 're gonna be a damn circus , best to be in the centre ring . What have you got ? ERIC : What are you doing ? These fell out of the heads of a half a dozen brain tumour patients we 've been monitoring for the past couple of years . Fell out ? Put them away . Don 't worry . They 're dead . They 're like batteries . They 're not transmitting . We had to open up a half a dozen people before we got a live one . - It 's kind of like looking for pearls . - You got a live implant ? Okay , now check this out . This is really amazing . Send in the soldier . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! ALLIE : People come home for a lot of reasons . They come home to remember . They come home because they 've got no place else to go . They come home when they 're beaten . they come home when they 're proud . They come home looking for a door out into their past or a road out into their future . They come home for a lot of reasons . but they always come home to say good-bye . Look like you remembered ? Yeah , exactly . Doesn 't change much , does it ? TOM : There they are . Hey . Mum 's just waking up . I 'm glad you guys came . My mum really wanted to get a look at Lisa . Come on . TOM : They say we 're lucky because it 's taking her so quick . With cancer , it could 've been a lot worse . Hello , honey . How do you like this , huh ? They tell me it 's the cigarettes , but I don 't think I 'd have lived this long without ' em . You grew up real nice . How you doing ? I 'm good , Mum . I see that . That 's fine . ( knocks gently ) - Tom . - Yeah . Come on in . Mum , this is Carol , my wife . Hi , Carol . How you doing ? Pleasure to meet you . And this ... is Lisa . Tom , come take this thing out of my nose so I don 't look so scary to that child . ( coughs ) Come here , darlin ' . Let me get a look at you . Come on , honey . It 's okay . Hello , Grandma . You 're a pretty girl . She 's got your father 's eyes . TOM : Jake , I know who your dad was . When the government was doing these experiments- - this is all freedom of information act stuff- - it was the beginning of the Cold War , and people were scared and willing to do anything , so they took these soldiers and filled ' em with psychotropic drugs to see what happened , and I believe that your dad was one of those soldiers . When he escaped from the army base at Roswell , Owen Crawford tried to get him back . It might be a little bit more complicated than that . Your abilities . You got ' em from your father . Whatever the drugs had done to him , like those women who took thalidomide ... I think that they 're taking civilians now , doing the same experiments , mind control or " processing , " whatever you wanna call it , to make them think they 're being abducted by aliens . And you know that this is not the case ? The government makes them think that , but it 's their cover story , Jake . For a cover story , it seems ... a little bit far-fetched , doesn 't it ? Mum 's in a lot of pain . Morphine doesn 't seem to be helping . It 's okay , Mum . It 's okay . It 's okay . Let 's help you up , Mum . Okay . Jacob , it 's time for me to go , honey . Soon . Tom ... You just sit up , Mum . You just sit up . TOM : What are you doing , Jake ? Something for Mum . JAKE : It 's all right , Tom . Come on , Sally , let 's go home . I don 't wanna believe this , Jake . You never wanted to . You always kind of did , though . Right from when John came , and you saw the lights . That 's why all those years you ... tried so hard to prove that it was a conspiracy , a lie . Those are easier things to believe in . It was kind of ironic , though , don 't you think ? Country 's leading debunker turns out to have a half-alien half brother ? What are you going to do now ? I want you to come forward , Jake . I can 't do that , Tom . We 're talking about something that the entire world has a right to know . You were the proof that it happened , Jake . What do you want me to do , go on TV , bend some spoons ? It 'd turn into a freak show in a minute and a half , and you know it . Then at least people would know it really happened . Would they ? Why did they come , Jake ? What do they want ? I don 't know . I do know that I 'm not the only one who 's special to them . It 's a feeling I get sometimes , that there is someone else . They 're playing catch-up , the government . They 're trying to figure out the same things you ask me- - why they came , what they want . Owen Crawford knew about me . If they 're not already doing it , they 're going to try and find that other person . ERIC : Jesse Keys . One of my father 's many failures . Not to speak ill of the dead , though , right ? He kills this guy 's father , then loses him . I 'd say , all in all , he screwed that one up . He couldn 't have known what would happen when they took out Russell Keys ' implant , but if it makes you feel better to think your old man screwed up ... And this one--Jesse ? He mattered to them . He was important . I mean , we grab these people , we pop the implants out of their heads , we even kill some of them , but our little grey friends don 't do squat . But this guy , they pulled him right through the wall of a bomb shelter to take him away from us . I don 't think you can lay that one on your father either . What do you think it all means ? Maybe nothing . Could be there 's some they chew on repeatedly , and others they spit out after just one bite . Now that we 're looking more into the genetics , we 'll figure it out . We 're really close . What about those brothers in Alaska ? Failed attempts at crossbreeding , like that kid Jacob Clarke your old man tried to bring back from Texas . Jacob Clarke dies , and we all know what happened to the furry freak brothers . You see what they 're doing , don 't you ? Everything they can . This is an FBI aging program . Some fugitive goes underground for ten years , they wanna know ' em if they see ' em . And I 'll lay you diamonds to doughnuts this Jesse Keys is still alive . You wanna find out what 's so important about him ? Maybe we should ask him . - MAN OVER RADIO : Truck eight . - Yeah . Chief , we 've got one over at Morgan 's Junction . Car full of college kids . It 's pretty ugly . Paramedics on the scene . We 've also got a tractor injury at Sutter 's and a kid pulled out of Hodgkin 's Creek . Paramedics at both . I 'll take the car . ( siren wails ) Get over . Keep moving , people . Let 's go . Keep moving . Keep that lane open . Let 's go . Let 's move . What do we got , Bobby ? Just kids on the way home from Milton . Drunk , lost control of the car , flipped it . Driver was killed instantly . Two boys in the back pretty banged up . They 're on their way to County , and the girl in the passenger seat 's a spinal . We 're just getting her out now . WOMAN : Lights . We saw these lights . In the sky . And then my friends . They 've been taken to the hospital . Kevin . Hey , can you do something for me ? Can you keep your head straight and follow my pen with your eyes ? Good . We 're gonna have you out of here in just a minute , but can you just keep your head straight and keep your eyes on my pen ? Can you do that for me ? - Mm-hmm . - Good . ( Bobby retching ) Bobby ? Damn it . I 'm sorry , chief . My first accident , I puked all over my chief 's shoes . Don 't get any ideas . Look , you know what I love about this job ? You come to a scene , you look at it , you assess the situation , and your job 's to make it better . You can do that , no matter how bad it is . You can always make it better . Not for that guy who was driving , not for him . Then you move on . That 's what it 's all about . You find someone you can help . Here , make sure she stares straight ahead . Don 't let her look at the blood on the windshield , okay ? Thanks , chief . MAN : Get out of the road . You nuts ? I can 't believe you 're still out here . Look , this is all my fault . The other guys thought you were with me . I thought you got a ride back with the sheriff 's guys . How long have I been out here ? Uh ... two-and-a-half , three hours . Look , I 'm really sorry , chief . I don 't know what else to say . - Hey , Dad . - Hey , Charlie . Did you know 1 2 people ... ALLIE : Some people put a lot of work into their lawn . as if a patch of green grass was the most important thing in the world . as if they thought that as long as the lawn out front was green and mowed and beautiful . it wouldn 't matter at all what was going on inside the house . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Let 's get this place cleaned up before Mum gets home , okay ? Okay . Come on . Get in . Dad said he 's gonna come see my play . Yeah , I 'm sure he will , honey . Can you help me with my costume ? Yeah , sure . Mum ... Is Dad all right ? Yeah , of course he is . - What do you mean ? - I don 't know . It 's just ... he seems like he 's scared of something . I 've known your father a long time . There is one thing I know about him- - he 's not afraid of anything . 'Night , kiddo . Right there , ace . Hey , I know you . I 'm Luke Reynolds . You pulled my son Moe out of our sweep auger last year . What the hell are you doing out here ? Oh . You come to look at my lower field . - Lower field ? - My glow-in-the-dark wheat . Heh heh . Come on . Ain 't that a bitch ? There was an accident out here today . Yep , pretty bad one . Had the field been glowing before the accident ? Nope . It started right after that . It 's the shape of it that gets me , though . Look at it . Looks like a damn flying saucer . This hostage thing shows you what happens when you let your enemies see your weakness . We should 've gone in there the moment they were taken and gotten ' em back at any cost . Miss Fox says if we 'd done that , they might 've killed the hostages . Maybe , but they would 've been less likely to do it again . Can we talk about something else ? How would you like to move ? Like to Henderson , someplace a little further outside of town ? No . I was thinking more like Maine . Don 't you think this is a little sudden ? Dad , is this ' cause there 's flying saucers in Maine ? Dylan Peters said you were the flying-saucer soldier and that you were in charge of all of it . No , I don 't think it 's too sudden at all . ALLIE : Do you know the feeling of daring yourself to walk across a dark room ? That way you 're excited because you know- - you really do know- - that there 's nothing there to hurt you . Some people get to choose their dark rooms . They get to look for places where fear is only skin-deep . But some people are nowhere near that lucky . What do you want from me ? ! Leave me alone ! Why are you coming back now ? What do you want ? Leave my family alone ! What do you want now ? ! Jesse ! What are you doing ? Jess ? For a while after they pulled me out of that temple in Vietnam , they stopped . I 'd think about them once in a while , but I 'd convinced myself that the stuff that happened with my dad when I was younger and in the jungle had just all been in my mind . These are the guardian angels you told me about . I don 't know if I call them angels , but ... they were the reason why I did a lot of what I did back there , you know . I did some pretty crazy things just to see if , you know , they would save me . And they did ? Every single time . Honey ... maybe it is all in your mind . You 're more than due for some post-traumatic stress . Look at this . You don 't see it ? See what ? The rash . It 's shaped like a hand . We 've been through a lot , you and I , yeah ? And we 're gonna get through this , just like all the rest . Jesse , I want you to see someone for me . You owe me that much . Just see someone . They 'll just tell me I have a tumour . That 's not necessarily what they 're gonna say . I was diagnosed with a brain tumour when I was 1 6 . My father died of one . Okay , then you really do need to see someone . There is something in my head . It 's no tumour , though . It 's something they put there . Something that tells them- - For god 's sake , Jesse , would you listen to yourself ? ! Look , honey , see someone . If you won 't do it for me , do it for Charlie . Okay . ( knocks ) You found a small tumour on the front of my brain no bigger than the tip of a lead pencil . I talked to Amelia . She told me you 've been behaving strangely . The tumour is very small , no sign of a fluid build-up , but still , it could explain your recent behaviour . Dr Franklin Traub is the best brain tumour man in the country . He 's at the Rivers Clinic in St. Paul . I just spoke to him . You have an appointment tomorrow . Thanks . Um ... any commonality in the stories ? Well . I think the first thing you want to remember- - you and everyone at home- - is that these are normal people just like you and me . with no history of psychosis or schizophrenia. no mental illness . They 're normal people talking about something that has really happened to them . The striking thing is how similar all the stories are . He always was comfortable in a crowd . Any minute , he 's going to start doing card tricks . I always knew , Jake . I always did . But I never thought that contactor Mum was building out in the garage was gonna get your father 's attention . She needed a better power supply with an impedance-matched output coupling . You can sit around here all afternoon reminiscing or help clean out the garage . Your loudmouth brother 's gonna ride both sides of this alien thing all the way to the bank . Kim , Andy , you 're done playing . We got work to do . Uncle Ronnie , just ' cause you 're jealous that Aunt Becky 's spending time with my dad is no reason to yell at Kim and Andy . It 's not going to make the fact that Uncle Tom 's getting a lot of attention go away , either . She is your daughter , isn 't she ? Mr Clarke . I don 't mean to question your ability or your expertise . but I have to point out here that up until very recently. you were one of the leading debunkers of this entire phenomenon . So we 'd all like to know what changed your mind . - I have personal information . - You were taken ? No . No. that 's not what I said . Now there 's a story that we 'd all like to hear . Well ... I 'm not at liberty to say . Hold on--hold on. folks . You have evidence of an alien being here on earth. and you 're not sharing ? Mr Clarke . I find that hardly fair . I think more than anything else we 'd all like to know . what changed your mind ? We 'll take a break . You 're right . That thing in your brain is no tumour . It 's very small . Looks metallic . - Where did you grow up ? - Illinois . Any exposure to chemicals ? Heroin . You say your father had a similar tumour . Yeah , identical . We see these deposits occasionally in people who work with unusual chemicals , chelated heavy metals , things like that . Sometimes they occur for no obvious reason . Usually , they 're mistaken for tumours , but in actual fact , it 's just foreign matter that 's swept up into a little pile the body doesn 't know how to get rid of . Now , the important thing is , we can treat this without surgery . We can use localized ultrasound therapy , get this thing to break out , dissolve . You 'll pass it in a matter of days . No surgery ? That 's great . Must be disconcerting to wake up one morning and your whole world 's changed . For me , it was more like my whole world had come back . This happened before ? Yeah , when ... when I was a kid , when I was a teenager and again in Vietnam . If you 're prone to this sort of thing , it 's not surprising it 's gonna reoccur . Could it be affecting Jesse mentally ? It 's possible . You 've been having problems ? Uh ... yeah , but I think if you can get this thing out of my head , then it 'll make them go away . JESSE : I 'll be home for Thanksgiving . It 's gonna be all right , Jesse . JESSE : You know when I was a kid , the time I told you about when I saw my dad- - I was , uh , locked up in a bomb shelter on an air force base . There are people involved in this , too- - very vicious people . You 're gonna be all right . This is all gonna go away . I don 't care if you don 't believe the rest , but you have to believe this- - I was taken . Locked up by some people involved with the air force , and they--I got away , joined the army under a fake name . I don 't know if they stopped looking for me , but , uh , now that this has all started again , just ... keep it in mind . Okay . Hey . Remember our list of all the things I said I 'd explain one day ? Mm-hmm . Aren 't you glad I waited as long as I did ? ( car door closes ) ( car engine starts ) ( knock on door ) Hey , that 's a pretty good book . Yeah , I don 't read much . Irving places far too much importance on death , in my way of thinking , but at least he makes it funny . He 's good . Jesse , you don 't believe you 've got a metallic deposit in your head , do you ? You have your thoughts about what I have in my head , and I have mine . You wanna share your thoughts with me ? No , I 'd rather not . Why are you here if you don 't believe I can help you ? No . You have to help me . You say you can make this thing in my head dissolve . That 's what I want . I don 't care what it is . I have a nine-year-old son , and I almost hurt him because of this thing in my head . I don 't care about anything else . I don 't care about anything else at all . ( dials telephone ) ( line ringing ) Hello . Dr Wakeman , please . Traub here , Rivers Clinic . I 've got the man you 're looking for . BOY : I 'm gonna get you , Allan Holmes ! Shut your mouth , Allan Holmes ! Whoa , slow down there , kid ! Come on , take it easy . What 's the problem ? - Let me go ! - What is this about ? He started it . - Did not . - Did ! Everybody knows your dad went crazy when he ran out of the house screaming . Your dad 's nuts . Now they 've locked him up . That 's enough , all of you ! Now , Charlie 's dad is sick . It 's very serious . He 's gone away to get well . We 're praying for him . Sorry . Hope your dad gets better . So we 're going down to the Lemke 's . I hear they have a wicked haunted house . You wanna come ? No more fighting ? - Promise . - All right , kiddo . Have a good time . They 're so forgiving--children . I didn 't mean to butt in . I was enjoying the evening . I 'm glad you were here . Thank you . I 'm sorry to hear about your husband . I hope he 'll be all right . Thanks . Yes , I 'll hold . - Hi , honey . How are you ? - Lonely . How was Halloween ? It was great . Charlie 's Darth Vader . I really just called ' cause I wanted to hear your voice . ALLIE : When everything in your life is right on track . it 's easy to believe that things happen for a reason . It 's easy to have faith . But when things start to go wrong . then it 's very hard to hold on to that faith . It 's hard not to wonder whose reasons these things happen for . How long you gonna keep him under ? A couple hours . Let him think we did a full work-up . What do you ... think these marks on his chest are ? Looks almost like a hand . Maybe he fought back . So what do you want to do with him ? Take that thing out of his head ? They 're a dime a dozen . I don 't want the implant . I want him . He believes they 've saved him , repeatedly , in Vietnam , other places . They probably did . It 's just he 's extremely important to them . Okay , what do we know ? They 're working towards something , but what ? Do they wanna destroy the planet ? Save us from ourselves ? Turn us into pod people ? Anyway , we look at the stuff we got from one of the bodies from the New Mexico crash , and these beings , these ... aliens , what have you they 're us . Same genetic make-up . At least so far . The same could be said about the fruit fly . Maybe that 's the point . ALLIE : What makes a man who he is ? Is it the worst things he 's ever done or the best things he wants to be ? When you find yourself in the middle of your life . and you 're nowhere near where you were going . how do you find a way from the person you 've become to the one you know you could 've been ? What did you do with my Cabbage Patch Kids ? They 're in one of the boxes , honey . Can you take them out of the boxes ? They don 't like being taken places in boxes . We 'll unpack them when we get to our new place . Why can 't I tell my friends where we 're going ? Ask your father . - I want my dolls unpacked ! - Honey , we can 't . - Hello , thrill-seekers . - Uncle Chet . - Hiya , sweetheart . How you doing ? - Good . Where 's your dad ? In the study . Come on . Come on . ( knock on door ) Come in . Dad , Mum won 't unpack my Cabbage Patch Kids . I 'll talk to her about it , Mary , after I 'm done with my meeting . Don 't ever move . We got Jesse Keys in a clinic in Minnesota . That 's the prize your dad could never get . What do you want to do with him ? I 'm thinking . I 'm thinking . ERIC : While you 're thinking , make sure you don 't lose him . I don 't wanna make the same mistakes my father made . Your old man 's been dead , what , ten years now ? Yes . So don 't you think you can stop trying to kick his ass ? One of our researchers was going through some old files and came across these . Any idea what they are ? They look like the glyphs from that excavation site in Alaska , the one where my brother died . That 's what I thought , too , but these are dated 1 947 . That burial chamber in Alaska wasn 't opened up until 1 970 . - Did you translate it ? - Can 't be done . So close . We got Jesse Keys under wraps . Genetics guys are finding out more and more every day . My engineers tell me they 're following something very cool on the implants . We 're on the verge of a major breakthrough here . Eric ? There something you 're not sharing ? You know everything I know . I know a hell of a lot more than you do , old pal of mine , but what I was asking was is if ... there was something you weren 't sharing . And what I told you was no . What are these ? ERIC : Tom Clarke . You didn 't see him on TV the other day talking about the government conspiracy to cover up the presence of aliens here on earth ? I don 't like to watch TV during the day . Weirds me out . Suddenly , he 's the Woodward and Bernstein of alien abduction . Tom Clarke , huh ? The Tom Clarke who ruined my father . The Tom Clarke who thought our entire program was a lie . His first two books here do nothing but debunk everything about extraterrestrial life , about visits , about our work . Don 't you wanna know what changed his mind ? - Bye , Mum . - Bye . Good-bye . Bye . Have a good day . ERIC : You 're much prettier than I expected . Your surveillance photographs don 't do you justice . Is this visit about something more than my good looks ? I understand your brother has switched sides , that he 's now a believer . Wanna tell me what changed his mind ? You and your brother have a way of sort of gumming up my family 's work , so I 'm going to be honest with you . I 'm not doing this out of any compelling need to tell the truth . I just think it 's the only method that 'll work . There . I 'm doing it already . Do you look a lot like your mother ? People say I do . My father was a bastard . What he did to your mother was unforgivable . My father found a spaceship in the New Mexico desert . There were four bodies on that ship . There were spaces for five bodies . He came to your home looking for the guy who was sitting in that fifth seat . My father devoted the rest of his life to trying to find out what these visitors wanted . He ran a government group dedicated to that quest . Since his death , I 've been in charge of that group . Technically , we 're part of the air force , but the paperwork is so muddled I couldn 't even tell you who I work for . This planet has been visited thousands of times since my father found that ship . People have been taken from their homes , things have been done to them . With a lot of money and a lot of very good minds , we 're beginning to understand some things about our visitors , but we still don 't know why they 're doing all this . We don 't know what they want . My father was a ruthless , ambitious son of a bitch , but the things he wanted to know were reasonable . This could be the greatest threat the world has ever known . This could be something miraculous . We have to know . We have to do whatever it takes to find out . I am not my father . You don 't have to tell me what changed your brother 's mind right away . You could do something else instead . What ? Let me show you something . I 've been reading these reports from your genetics team . - This is astounding stuff . - Pretty cool , huh ? - Very . - There 's something new . These devices they put in people 's heads , I told you we 're pretty sure they 're a tracking system , right ? They are . My guys have found the signal they give off . But the signal is incredibly weak . It needs to be amplified somehow before it can be transmitted back to the mother ship or the planet Zeta Reticuli or wherever our little buddies are hanging out . - You gotta love it . - Transmitter ? Where ? We don 't know . But the logical assumption , based on what we do know , is that it 's organic . - Organic ? - Don 't you love it ? A brain beaming thought signals out into the cosmos . This just keeps getting better and better . The energy of thought , of mind . We know that 's how they do things . We also know Jesse Keys is of particular importance to them . You think Jesse Keys is a transmitter . That 's why he 's so special . One way to find out . Shut him off . See if they come and turn him back on . So , are you gonna be getting back to work soon ? There 's a couple people starting up here in Texas I wanna check out first . You sure are in a hurry to get rid of me . No , it 's not that . Meat loaf 's gonna be ready about half an hour . Andy 's got arithmetic homework that he has to finish before he watches Charlie 's Angels . Your brother Tom 's too high-toned to come to the door now ? You gotta go outside to meet him ? You haven 't exactly been a prince to him every time he 's been over here the last couple times . Is he still pissed I didn 't go to your mum 's funeral ? I don 't know . If you want to know , why don 't you ask him ? Why should I have gone ? There 's no love lost between me and your old lady . RONNIE : All right , I 'll ask him . A cold day in hell is when . I 'll be home late . So unpack the Cabbage Patch Kids . What 's the problem ? All right , then , Julie , then don 't unpack them . I might be late . Don 't wait up . I don 't know why I 'm doing this . Curiosity . BECKY : Why would I get in a plane with you , of all people ? ERIC : I could put you in custody . It 's like that ? No , it 's not like that at all . I 'll have you back by 2 : 00 in the morning , spook 's honour . Oh . He actually said that ? Aliens were responsible for teenage drug abuse and open marriages ? And the success of the skateboard . You grow up in Vegas , you meet a lot of weirdoes . I guess so . My family is eating leftover meat loaf . My wife 's either called the Peking Inn or Pizza Hut . I got married really young . First girl I had slept with . First time I slept with her , she 's pregnant , I 'm married . Anything to show my father I was grown up . I just needed my own identity . Someplace where I wasn 't Tom Clarke 's little sister . Big brother shadow . I hear that . Sun rose and set on my brother Sam . - I guess a lot of people do that . - Hmm . They 're just kids trying to get away from home . They wind up smack-dab in the middle of their lives before they know what hit them . My kids are great . I guess everything 's got its upside . BECKY : Where are we ? ERIC : Let me put it to you this way- - your brother would be very jealous . We brought everything here from Wright-Patterson in ' 76 . It just made more sense to keep everything under one roof . Oh , my God . It 's breathtaking , isn 't it ? I come in here sometimes by myself . I ... sit and just stare at him . I keep feeling like if I stare just a little longer , I 'll be able to understand . Thank you for showing me this . I wasn 't going to . ALLIE : People move through their lives sometimes without really thinking about where they 're going . Days pile up . and they get sadder and lonelier without really knowing why they 're so sad or how they got so lonely . Then something happens- - they meet someone who looks a certain way or has something in their smile . Maybe that 's all that falling in love is- - finding someone who makes you feel a little less alone . I 'm moving . Did I tell you that ? No . Couple of air force sellouts write books , hit the talk-show circuit , couple of guys make movies . Carter says he saw a UFO . Next thing you know , I 've got a crowd . - You and your brother didn 't help . - Where are you gonna go ? I got a spot picked out in Maine . The gawkers will still come to the desert , and they 'll see the same experimental planes and think they 're seeing saucers , and we can continue our work undisturbed . When are you leaving ? Tomorrow night . Becky ... I-I didn 't mean for this to happen . I meant to charm you with my honesty and find out all I could about your brother , but that 's not how it worked out . I don 't wanna be the man that I am , but with you , I 'm somebody else . I 'm who I wanna be . Eric , we can 't- - I wanna be with you . What is so terribly wrong about that ? Nothing 's wrong with it . It 's just not possible . Of course it is . I 'm gonna tell Julie about us . Come with me . Leave Ronnie and come with me . Maine ? The trucks are leaving Groom Lake tomorrow night , sneaking out across the desert to avoid your brother and his friends by the mailbox . What is it ? Your work . Tom says you 've been taking people , experimenting on them . He says some of those people have died . Becky , I swear to you that your brother 's wrong . I 've never done anything to harm anyone . Would you leave Ronnie ? Yes . TOM : You 're sleeping with him ? It 's not as simple as that . Oh , okay . Everything 's okay , then ? He 's leaving his wife . He wants me to leave Ronnie . He wants us to stop interfering in his business , Becky ! Eric Crawford . Owen Crawford 's son . The son of the man who ruined your mother 's life . How could you do that ? He 's not his father . He 's covering up the biggest secret in American history . He 's lying to the entire public on a regular basis . What in the hell makes you think he 's not lying to you ? ! You don 't respect anything at all , do you ? You 're just a selfish little girl who married the wrong guy , and you 're willing to walk on anyone 's grave you have to get away from him . This is not about me and Eric . This is about what Owen did to Mum . No , it 's not . Not anymore . It 's about blowing the lid on this thing wide open . How could something this huge have happened and the whole world doesn 't know about it ? That 's wrong , Becky . Did you tell him about Jacob ? No . You don 't trust him , either . ( knock on door ) Well ... you 're making short work of that book . Not a lot to do around here , you know . What is it ? Well , your deposit is not disintegrating as quickly as I had hoped . This is Dr Patterson from the Brazel Clinic . Does this look anything like an astronaut 's helmet ? It looks perfect . I wish Dad was here . He 's good at making things like this . Yeah , he is . ( telephone rings ) Go on . - Hello ? - Hey. big guy . Hey , Dad . Mum , it 's Dad . Are you going to be able to come to my play ? I 'm sure gonna try . How was Halloween ? Allan Holmes called you crazy . so I punched him . then some guy pulled me off . I was gonna punch him again . but he wanted me to go to the Lemke 's house 'cause they had a haunted house there . It was so cool . Can you come to my play ? I hope so . Can I talk to Mum for a sec ? Okay . Just a sec . It 's for you . - Hi , honey . - Hey . They 're moving me . This thing in my head isn 't going away , and there 's a new doctor , and they 're gonna take me to someplace called the Brazel Clinic and see what they can do for me . Okay . I love you . - Call me when you get there . - I love you , too . Yeah . I sure hope that Dad 's all right . Maybe I shouldn 't have told him about how I got into a fight with Allan . I don 't want him to worry about me . Mum ? Mum , what 's wrong ? - It 's a big country . - Yeah . We 'll take care of that thing in your head . Once it 's gone , no more little grey men . - I 'm ready . - That 's good . How 'd you know the little men were grey ? - Educated guess . - Right . One small step for mankind- - I mean , man . One giant leap for mankind . ( applause ) The giant leap that Neil Armstrong was talking about was a leap into outer space for him and his Apollo team . They started the journey , but it 'll be up to us to continue it . - I can 't believe you came . - Are you all better ? Yeah . - Did you like my play ? - I loved it . It was pretty cool , wasn 't it ? Pretty cool . Dad , what are those lights ? Why are we stopping here ? Hey , Dad ... Dad ? What 's going on ? Dad ! - Come over here . - What 's happening ? Come here . Dad ? He 's not your father , Charlie . Don 't listen to him , Charlie . It 's me . It 's okay . He isn 't me . He 's making me from the picture in your head . He 's lying . He 's not your dad . Watch , I 'll change the picture . Remember last month I cut myself shaving , and I came downstairs and I had blood on my chin ? Charlie . Charlie , do you remember ? CHARLIE : What 's going on ? JESSE : You 're not gonna take him ! Leave my boy alone ! You 're not gonna take him ! Charlie , get away from him . Dad ! Get away from my boy ! No ! ( gunshot ) MAN ON C.B. : Truck 1 7 . we 've got an engulfment event at the Pioneer grain silo on Erlington . We 've got two men with a grain bridge collapse . ( horn blares ) Hello ! Anybody ! It wasn 't a stroke or a seizure . Could this have been caused by the tumour ? I don 't know . The nearest I can come to it , it 's like someone held his brain too close to a magnet . Mum ? Jesse . Get me a towel , please . What 's happening to him ? They 'll come for Charlie next . You gotta go . I 've called for help . I 'll see what 's taking them . Wait a minute . Who did you call ? Help . - Jesse . - You 've gotta go . Come on , Charlie . Let 's get out of here . ( Andy laughing ) ERIC : I don 't wanna be the man that I am . Can you understand that ? TOM : What in the hell makes you think he 's not lying to you ? ! TOM : Eric Crawford . Owen Crawford 's son . The son of the man who ruined your mother 's life . How could you do that ? Did you tell him about Jacob ? BECKY : No . TOM : You don ' t trust him. either . ERIC : Come with me . Leave Ronnie and come with me . TOM : You don ' t respect anything at all. do you ? You 're a selfish little girl who married the wrong guy . You 're willing to walk on anyone 's grave you have to get away from him ! ERIC : You live your life step by step . doing what you do . Someday you look up. and you 're this person you didn 't plan to be . but with you . I 'm somebody else . What is so terribly wrong about that ? BECKY : Nothing 's wrong with it . It 's just not possible . ALLIE : Sometimes people come to a moment where they think they 've found that one last chance to be someone else . and they go for it . When it doesn 't work out . they spend the rest of their lives looking back over their shoulder at what might have been . Let 's go . ( engine starts ) ( camera shutter clicks rapidly ) MAN : Right there . Few more feet . ( forklift hums ) Perfect . How you gonna get through the crowd at the gate ? Three trucks come out , get the crowd 's attention , then take off through the desert . When we 're sure they 're being chased , then the real trucks will leave . Hmm . You think it 'll work ? We 'll see . You okay ? You seem kind of down . - Hard to say good-bye , I guess . - We 're doing the right thing . The tourists can still come out and watch the stealths , and we 'll all live happily ever after . Right . Oh , man . Oh , man , oh , man , oh , man , oh , man . Ahem . You went out and got your little heart broken , didn 't you ? ( snickers ) Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Ohh ! ALLIE : I never met my grandfather . but my father told me he was a very brave man . And with all that he 'd done- - maybe because of all he 'd done- - his favourite thing in all the world was to mow the lawn . My dad said he heard his father talking to a neighbour once . The neighbour asked him how he was and what he 'd been doing . and my grandfather said . " I 've been cutting the grass and watching it grow . " Cutting the grass and watching it grow . Life . " he said . " is 90 % maintenance . " Jackson Browne : # . Oh. people. look around you # . # . The signs are everywhere # . # . You 've left it for somebody other than you # . # . To be the one to care # . # . You 're lost inside your houses # . # . There 's no time ... # . Drinks are here . Honey , we 're gonna be moving around for a little while . Kind of like The Dukes of Hazzard ? Yeah , kind of like . Is this because of what happened to Dad ? There 's some people who want to talk to us , and I don 't wanna talk to them . They 're not people . I-It doesn 't matter , sweetheart . They 're not gonna find us again . Hey . Sometimes , when bad things are happening ... we imagine things . Maybe we think the things we make up can 't hurt us as much as the real things that are actually happening . Even if what we make up is scary , too . Does that make any sense ? Is Dad ever gonna be all right ? I don 't know . I really don 't know . This isn 't fair . There 's nothing fair about this ! No , there 's not . # . Rock me on the water # . # . I 'll get down to the sea # . # . I 'll get down to the sea somehow # . Hey , this song got me through my freshman year of college . This , and several plants we need never discuss . Your father always hated this music . Anything that was popular while he was away . It wasn 't so much the war as how he was just supposed to come back and act like nothing ever happened . I know none of this makes any sense to you right now . You just have to know that your daddy loves you . Okay ? Hey , dance with me . Come on , come on , come on , get up . Come on . # ... . Soothe my fevered brow # . Let 's just dance for a while , okay ? # . Rock me on the water # . # . Maybe I 'll remember # . # . Maybe I 'll remember how # . # . Rock me on the water # . # .

RADIO ANNOUNCER : The way Carter handled the hostage crisis really sealed his fate . The American people were fed up . Henry. from Selma . California . don ' t you agree ? HENRY : Absolutely . When citizens are taken against their will . people want to hold someone accountable . When a president is not swift and strong in response a man who 's willing to take strong action . and Reagan ' s that man . People can ' t stand to see their response . There 's no doubt this is why Carter lost ... Do you have your sidearm ? We 'd like to take a look in the back of your truck . That would be a violation of about three dozen army and air force regulations . TOM : We believe you 're in violation of a lot more than that . We believe you 're carrying the evidence of a spacecraft that crashed in the New Mexico desert in 1 947 . ERIC : What kind of evidence ? We believe that you recovered bodies from that wreckage and that you 're transporting them . Bodies ? Where would you have gotten an idea like that ? TOM : Can we take a look at your cargo , please ? In the interest of fairness , full disclosure , and you not wasting any more of my time , absolutely . I was going to paint a big old happy face on the inside here and write the word " howdy , " but I just didn 't get around to it . Just so you know , my heart was in the right place . BECKY : Tom , ask him what 's in those crates . ERIC : Personal effects , things that belonged to my father . TOM : We 'd like to take a look . ERIC : I 'm afraid I can 't have you snooping through my father 's affairs . You and your friends here will be driven to Las Vegas , held for 72 hours , and then released . Detained with what cause ? You were detained for interfering with a scheduled move of air force personnel . When we determined you weren 't spies , we let you go . Bastard . What did you expect me to do ? You wouldn 't let me be someone else . Look . Look ! You still don 't know how to fly it , do you ? How long do you think you can cover something like this up ? As long as I have to . The crates . Get these people onto the trucks . - Do it now ! - Yes , sir . - Step up . - Let 's go . All right , everybody into the trucks ! Move it ! This way ! This way , please . Let 's go . That 's it , move it up . What are you gonna do with all these witnesses ? Hold them for 72 hours , convince them what they saw was the Goodyear blimp . They 're not gonna believe that . They 're gonna talk about this . Let them . The more people talk at once , The more it sounds like nothing but noise . They took your bodies , too , didn 't they ? Now what are you gonna do now they 've taken back all your proof ? It didn 't have to be this way . How could it have been any different ? It 's all gone . You gotta love it . We must have been getting close . Why do you say that ? Remember I said I thought they had an organic transmitter ? I think it was one of the bodies . We missed that . It was right in front of us , and we missed it . They couldn 't afford to have us figure it out , so they just ... Took it all back . Every last bit of it . Not quite everything . CHET : Well , as expected , they pulled our plug . ERIC : What are they going to do ? All our evidence , all our research is gone . I thought I made a pretty good argument . " Senator , " I said , " the reason we have nothing to show you " is that it was plucked from our slimy little hands " by a flying saucer . You can 't deny that . Right out of the sky , and pluck . " Too bad we couldn 't find Charlie Keys . You know what burns my ass ? I 'll tell you what burns my ass . If we 'd gotten any funding at all , I could have gotten that positioning system running . We could have tracked Keys by that thing in his head and found him or anyone else taken in 24 hours . What are you going to do now ? Couple of buddies of mine from Yale are going into biotech . How about you ? I just keep picturing Tom Clarke smiling that smug smile of his and saying , " Still don 't know how it flies , do you ? " What you keep picturing is his sister dumping you . I still want to know what made Tom Clarke a believer . You could have had your answer , but you thought with " little Eric . " " Hey , little buddy , where do you want to go ? " " Over to Becky 's house . " " Okay . " " Hey , let 's take her to see the alien . " " Good idea . That 'll really impress her . " My own personal foibles aside , I still want the answer to that . I want to know what changed his mind . ALLIE : Is every moment of our lives built into us before we 're born ? If it is. does that make us less responsible for the things we do . or is the responsibility built in. too ? After you hit the ball. do you stand and wait to see if it goes out . or do you start running and let nature take its course ? If that ball had been another couple of inches , it would have gone out of the park , end of story . I swung too late . I thought it was gonna sink . That 's why I like baseball- - you can 't make assumptions . I thought you liked it because it was impossibly hard and there are useless statistics you could memorize . Yeah , that , too . Ohh- - Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'll be fine . We 'd better get home . This was your grandmother 's . Love you , sweetie . Every day and twice on Sundays . Honey ! Honey ! Stay with him . I 'm gonna call 91 1 . It 's beautiful . So are you . He 's gonna know it , too . Who ? The guy you 're gonna meet one day . He 's gonna take one look at you ... And he 's gonna know there is nowhere else he wants to be . ( music plays ) # . I gave you my time # . # . Why you wanna ... # . ( wind howls ) ( new song plays on the jukebox ) Sorry it took so long , honey . Charlie ? Charlie ? Charlie ? Honey ? Charl- - Honey . Honey ! You can 't run off like that . I thought- - What 's wrong ? Where were you , sweetie ? Where 'd you go ? Oh , Charlie . ( electric guitar plays ) He 'd been , um ... Getting weaker since your grandmother died . I kept asking him to see someone , but ... He wouldn 't . He was so ... resigned . I guess he understood what was happening to him . That sounds just like something he would say . ( guitar continues ) Damn it ! Damn it , Danny ! Hey , Danny ! - ( guitar stops ) - Danny ! Carol , what 's up ? My husband just died is what 's up . My husband is dead , and I 'd appreciate it if you 'd stop making all that noise . Oh , man . I 'm so sorry . If there 's anything I can do ... ( bell rings ) ALLIE : People say that when we grow up . we kick at everything we 've been told . we rebel against the world our parents have worked so hard to bring us into . that part of growing up is kicking at the ties that bind . But I don 't think that 's why we kick at all . I think we kick when we find out that our parents don 't know much more about the world than we do . They don 't have all the answers . We rebel when we find out that they 've been lying to us all along . that there isn 't any Santa Claus at all . ( chattering ) Hey , do you like Husker Du ? I think Bob Mould is probably as deep as it gets . I saw them last year in Sacramento . He was great . I 'm Nina Toth . - I 'm Lisa . - Hi . So how was your first day ? Brutal ? This place is totally harsh , so I 'm gonna make a suggestion . You wanna be friends ? For life . DANNY : Lisa ! And that 's my stepdad . - Really ? - Yep . My mum 's in Berkeley taking a class in alternative nutrition . Oh , cool . So it 's just me and Danny . Well , I gotta go . Okay . Make sure you call me . - All right . - Okay . - Bye . - Bye . RONALD REAGAN : Think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world . And yet . I ask you ... What could be more alien ... Wait till she forms her own band . ( drums pounding ) All right . Lisa ! Dinner 's ready . Lisa , come on . Dinner 's ready . Potatoes ... ( door shuts ) Lise ? Lise ? Lisa ? I 'm in here . Oh . Sorry . Everything all right ? There 's a phone number in my jacket pocket . Could you get it for me ? Yeah . Number one ... And number two . That ought to hold you . Mr Holding , do you have any champagne ? I 've got some Pepsi . - Pepsi will do . - All right . Just don 't expect me to give you the " today you are a woman " speech . Please don 't . I 'm really glad you called me . I 'm really glad you came . Ladies . Thank you . Here you go . - Thanks . - Lisa ... Today you are a woman . - Well said ! - Cheers . You 're the very first person I ever met who 's lived in a trailer park . My stepdad 's a musician , and the lady who owned a bar he played at owed him money , so we just wound up with this trailer . Don 't apologize . It 's very , um ... Rockford Files . I know , I 'm totally strung out on television . Hey , Nina , thanks again . It was a pleasure meeting you . No problem . Next time Lisa needs anything from the store , give me a call , I 'll tell you which aisle . I 'll see you at school . - Bye . - Bye . You sure you don 't need a ride ? My mum 's picking me up . So ... Guess you 're gonna go out and get all grown up now , huh ? Your mum would be sad she was missing it . You 're getting really good on those drums . Thanks . Danny , I 'd like to take Watson for a walk now . I 'll leave the door open for you . Thanks . Come here . Come on . ( jingling ) Watson , come on . ( barking ) Shh ! Watson ! Watson ! Watson , what is it ? ( Watson barking ) Watson ! Watson ! Watson ! Lisa ... Today you are a woman . - Hi . - Hi . Why do you think the aliens took all their stuff back ? Well ... What makes you think they took it all ? Ha ha ha ! - Enjoy . - Thank you . I hear this was quite a show . Oh , w- - What do you want ? I find I have a lot of free time on my hands . Imagine that . How 's Becky ? You want to have a conversation that doesn 't end up with me coming over this table and stuffing my fist down your throat , you stay off of that subject ! We 're not enemies anymore , Tom . We 're on the same side . I 'm a private citizen now . Our friends saw to that when they took all our evidence . What do you want ? You went from a sceptic to a believer in a nanosecond . That happened months before the Mojave Desert sightings . I want to know why . Maybe I just saw the light . What do you know that you 're not telling ? Say hello to your sister for me . Tell her I miss her . BECKY : So , there was a lot of excitement around here while I was away . I 'm sorry I wasn 't here . I 'm fine , really . Your Uncle Tom has a lot of pretty weird ideas . You 're not starting to have the same ideas , are you ? What if I am ? You come from a special family . Your father had an amazing mind . He could look at things and figure them out . With people , too . He could see things other people couldn 't see . There was a lot about him that ... There was just a lot about him . Honey , your life is changing because you 're growing up . You 're not being abducted into a spaceship . You 're being " taken " into adulthood . Of the two , I 'd say that 's far and away the scarier proposition . Hi . For Austin , Texas , please . Yeah , the number for Tom Clarke . Thank you . How 's Pasadena ? You 've seen one genome , you 've seen ' em all . How 's Julie ? You two still haven 't gotten divorced ? Mary got into Yale , huh ? Thank you for that letter . I told you , they love me . Directed a play there my senior year , won a couple of awards . Gave Harry Hamlin his first part . How the hell you been , man ? Good . Really good . So , uh , what 's all this about ? They said they 'd tell us when we got here . Probably some investigation to find out how we lost a flying saucer . After 12 years , I think it 's about something a little bit more current than that . MAN : This is Mission Control . Do you copy ? Argonaut 1 , come in . Argonaut 1 , come in . Damn it. you guys . where the hell are you ? SECOND MAN : Mission Control . this is Argonaut 1 . What 's going on up there . Argonaut ? What do you mean . Houston ? You 've been off-line 2 hours and 20 minutes . Houston. our last transmission was only four minutes ago . We were at coordinates- - Oh. my God ! About three weeks ago , we sent a manned mission into space . This launch was unannounced . The purpose of this mission was to put certain sensitive equipment into orbit . What sort of equipment ? Do you remember a program of President Reagan 's , the Strategic Defence Initiative ? Yeah . Star Wars . As you probably remember , there were some questions about whether or not this program was feasible . Before President Bush revisits the project , we need to know that it 's viable . So what did you send up ? A reactor ? One of the drawbacks to getting the program off its feet was finding a compact power system that could put out enough kilowatts to power both particle beam weapons and rail guns . You did ! You put this thing into orbit , didn 't you ? Our payload was highly classified . The capsule had been in orbit for 1 4 hours . It was two hours away from being in a position where the payload was to be delivered . The astronauts went dark for almost 2 1 / 2 hours . They disappeared . No contact . Nothing . Then they were back , clear as day . They had no idea they 'd lost 2 1 / 2 hours of their lives . The payload ? Gone . CHET : I guess they didn 't want a reactor messing with whatever they 've got going on up there . This is a waste of time . The people in this room represent $ 286 billion a year in defence spending . We need your help , gentlemen . Stop playing games and tell us everything you know about whoever it is who 's out there and what the hell they want . ( clears throat ) I assume you ladies and gentlemen have all seen E. T. They 're nowhere near that nice . We are back , baby , we are back ! I don 't think you get how big what just happened here is . We are reinstated , fully funded , blessed for as long as Bush is in . Probably after that ! Would you mind getting into this without me ? I 'm gonna keep on the Tom Clarke thing . He keeps getting calls from someone in Los Altos , California . The phone is registered to a Danny Holding . I thought I 'd run out there and take a look . For a while , I thought all this was a bluff . I thought you had something big , but you 've been on this Tom Clarke thing 1 2 years now , and the best you can do is check his phone bill ? Forget Tom Clarke , will you ? I 've looked at other things , but it keeps coming back to him . The Clarke family , they matter . They 're the key to this . This is about your father , isn 't it ? You 're just trying to finish something he started . What exactly you trying to atone for here ? You might as well be looking for Charlie Keys . You 're not gonna come in ? I said good-bye to your father 1 3 years ago . This is something for you to do yourself . Dad ? He isn 't me . He 's making me from the picture in your head . He 's lying . What do you want from me ? ! Leave my family alone ! Dad . Aah ! They 're coming for you ! DANNY : We 've lived here for the last seven years . ERIC : " We " would be ? Myself , my wife , and my daughter . Do you rent , or do you own ? Who rents a trailer ? Are you interested in this sort of thing ? That 's my daughter 's . Well , it 's actually my stepdaughter . Is that important ? Sure it 's important . Everything 's important . Your stepdaughter ? Yeah , from my wife 's first marriage . She was married to the brother of the guy who wrote that book--Tom Clarke . Your wife 's first husband was ... - Jack . - Jack . Jack . That 's Lisa 's dad . We call him Jack , but I 've heard my wife refer to him as Jacob . Is this all part of a regular census questionnaire ? This is a follow-up , Mr Holding . It can never hurt to follow up . Well , here she is now . This is my daughter Lisa . This is Mister ... Jones . Mr Jones from the Census Bureau . I 'm very , very glad to meet you . Do you own any pets ? Oh , come on . Pick up , pick up . Tom Clarke . Uncle Tom , it 's Lisa . Lisa ! There 's a man here . I get a really bad feeling about him . You said I should listen to my feelings because they were from my dad . That 's right . You should . He says he 's from the Census Bureau , asking Danny a lot of questions . In civics , we learned about the census . It happens once every ten years . There 's not supposed to be another one until 2000 . What does he look like ? Blondish hair ... Shorter than you ... Kind of old , like 40 . He 's dangerous . You have to get out of there . Right now ? - Yeah. right now . - Okay Do you remember our plan ? Yes . Go to your friend Nina 's . I understand . I can be there by tomorrow night . ALLIE : My mum told me once that when you 're afraid of something . what you want more than anything else is to make it go away . You want your life back to the way it was before you found out there was something to be afraid of . You want to build a high wall and live your old life behind it . But nothing ever stays the same . It 's not your old life at all . but your new life with a wall around it . Your choice is not about going back to the way things were . Uncle Tom , thanks for coming . Your choice is about hiding or about going right to the heart of the thing that scares you . ( laughing and chatting ) That was so awesome . Schooled that guy . - Got the hands for it . - All right , Charlie , see you . - Good night , Charlie . - See you , Charlie . See you guys tomorrow . ( siren ) ( cat yowls ) ( wind whistling ) ( loud clank ) It 's homey . A person starting college , a life of their own , they need homey . Homey . I kinda like it . How much ? I 'll give your mum a call and let her know we got you settled , but I don 't want you calling her or anybody else for quite a while . Tell me about these people , why they 're looking for me . The man that came into your house , his name was Eric Crawford . His father was an army colonel . His name was Owen Crawford . And he came after your father ... came after Jacob . Your Aunt Becky and I fooled him into thinking that Jake was dead , but I guess that Eric figured it out . But why was Owen Crawford looking for my dad ? This has to do with the things you write about . See ? You already knew . You knew the first time you called me . And you said one day , you 'd explain it all . Yeah , well ... I think you 've had enough excitement for one day . Don 't you ? Listen , if you ever need me , this is what I want you to do . I want you to take out a personal ad in the national edition of the New York Times and have it say , " Drummer seeking gig with ... Texas country band . " You 're young . You could still develop decent taste in music . Listen . I know . But you 're gonna be okay . Okay . Our first date , your dad and I went for hot dogs . You know , your dad never kept his own medals . I don 't think he ever went to collect them . But he carried your grandfather 's with him every day of his life . They were in his pockets when he died . Your grandfather was a hero , Charlie , just like your dad . How 's your job ? I like teaching . I think I 'm pretty good . I 'm sure you are . What 's this ? That is a picture of your father . He must be about eight . This guy with him is his stepdad . Your father used to talk about this . It was the most scared he 'd ever been in his life . Yeah , yeah . This is definitely that . What ? Well , his stepdad took him to a carnival , one of those travelling kind they set up in vacant lots . Some games , some rides , that sort of thing . Those rides , they can be pretty scary . They spin you around , turn you upside down , drop the floor out from underneath you . But none of that scared your father , uh-uh . It was the carnies ... The guys who ran the rides . He said there was something about them that just gave him the creeps . Well , like this guy . I guess if you were eight , he 'd seem pretty creepy , huh ? What was wrong with dad ? He had a- - He had a brain disorder . Made him believe certain things . What kind of things ? He 's dead now . Do you really want to remember this part of him ? I want whatever I can get . He believed he 'd been taken ... by aliens . Lots of times . And the men ? The people we were hiding from ? - I guess they believed that , too . - How about you ? I don 't know , sweetie . I don 't know what I believe . Your dad said once they were like his guardian angels . He thought they were protecting him ? No , he thought they wanted him for something . He believed they had saved him from dying in Vietnam . I think , in the end , he thought they were coming after you . They have come for me . More than once . That 's why he screamed the last time he saw me . He could see that they were already taking me . If you were eight , yeah , maybe this would scare you . But you know what , mum ? None of this scares me anymore . Now it just makes me mad . If they come again , I 'm not going without a fight , and if that lands me in some hospital room , staring out some window , screaming , then that 's what it does . What was he like , my grandfather ? I didn 't really know him that well . He kind of frightened me . How come ? He was always nice to me . I--I don 't know . I guess he just terrified your father so much . All your father ever wanted from that man was a pat on the back . It 's amazing how not getting something so simple can do so much . ( door shuts ) When did you get in ? Night before last . I had a few days before fall quarter starts . Good to have you home . I 'm sorry , honey . He 's got a lot on his mind . Why don 't you leave him ? What ? Leave , as in pack your bags , walk out the door , and don 't come back . It 's not as simple as that . Yes , it is . He 's thoughtless , insensitive . If he can still get it up , he 's doubtless unfaithful . Honey- - You know it 's true . I have my compensations . I have you . So move to New Haven . You 'll have more of me and less of him . I can set you up with my " Perspectives on Science " professor . He 's very cute . You 're terrible . It 's in the blood . Do you think I look anything like him ? " Home is the sailor home from the sea and the hunter home from the hill . " I 've got something important to tell you . It can keep . I 've got earth-shattering news . You ready ? You wanna sit down or ... What 's your news ? I was wrong . " About what ? " you ask . " It 's like this , " I answer . I take all the money the generals threw at us , and I tell my guys , " Build me something that will pick up the impulse signals from those implants " - - The signals that were being amplified by that transformer . The transformer I said was the body we had stored at Groom Lake . Y-Yes . They build the thing . They turn it on . Voila ! Lights up like a Christmas tree . " Now , why does this make me wrong ? " you ask . Okay . These signals are big and bad and boosted . Somewhere on this planet , there 's still a transmitter going strong , as if when they grabbed all their stuff , they deliberately left it behind . What does this give us ? What I always said it would . We can track any implant , anytime , anywhere . Look at this . Find Alan for me , will you ? Remember that chip we took out of the girl from Cleveland ? We put it into the head of a guy named Alan . Works for the Department of the Interior . - Thinks he went in for a root canal . - Found him , sir . Get him . OPERATOR : Motel 6 . May I speak with Mr Alan Stewart ? One moment . ALAN : Hello ? - Mr Stewart ? - Yes . Hold for Dr Lamarr . WOMAN : Who 's on the phone ? Quiet . ( disguised voice ) It 's Dr Lamarr . Just wanted to check on your root canal . Is that your wife ? ! How does she know where you are ? I-I 'm fine . Dr Lamarr . how did you find me ? Mr Stewart , I 'm a dentist . That 's my job . WOMAN : If you 're gonna talk to her . what 's the point of being here with me ? I have to go . I 've got a patient in the chair . You understand . I still don 't understand how this helps us . Oh , yeah . This sea of blinking lights , our very own galaxy of abductees . How do we know who goes with each blinking light ? Exactly . We cross-reference known abductees , their movements , et cetera , with the implant data . We name them and eliminate them . That leaves unidentified abductees . If there 's someone we 're looking for , we feed in everything we can- - data from field agents , all of that--compare patterns . Amazing what you can do with a modern computer and a couple of billion dollars in taxpayers ' money . Can you find Charlie Keys ? Yeah . How would you like to find somebody else ? ( playing hard rock ) ( song ends ) You kinda suck . Do you think you can unsuck by a week from Wednesday ? We 've got a gig at the O.K. Hotel . I 'm in the band ? No one else answered the ad . No way , man ! Didn 't really mean it . About you sucking . You 're no worse than the rest of us . Thanks , I guess . Just felt kinda bad , like I hurt your feelings or something . I 'm tougher than that . First time away from home ? Yeah . ( scratching noises ) I remember the first time I slept on my own in my new apartment . When I woke up . it took me a minute to remember where I was . ( chuckles ) I 'm lying there thinking how weird it is . Yesterday. when I woke up . everything was normal . Today. it 's gonna be different forever . That 's exactly what happened to me . I expect to wake up any minute and be back in my old room ... " It was all just a dream . " ( noises continue ) Thanks for being so nice . It makes all of this a little less heavy . Anytime . No , you are not gonna take me ! You are not gonna take me again ! You get the hell away from me ! Get the hell away from me ! ( knock on door ) ( knocking ) It 's open . ( gasps ) What are you doing ? Sorry , Naomi . I 'm sorry . Nothing . Sorry . This is how you 're spending your leave of absence ? Sitting in the dark , reading , with a baseball bat by the door in case anyone drops by ? I just needed a little time by myself . I 've been principal at Lincoln for ten years , and I taught there before that . Charlie , you 're the best teacher I 've ever seen . I 'm not gonna lose you without a fight . What is all this ? That 's nothing . " The Alien Agenda : What The Abductions Really Mean " ? Compendium of Alien Races ? " Adopt An Alien " ? What is this all about ? Oh , my God . You think you 've been abducted by aliens . Do you have any idea how many people say that they 've been abducted every year ? Charlie ... People believe in those things because they have to believe in something . If that 's all it is , how come all the stories are so similar ? Because we see the same movies , we read the same books ... They 've been taking me since I was nine . The last time they took me was only six weeks ago . They came into this house , and they took me . I tried to fight back . I kicked and I hit and I bit . It did nothing ! They ripped me right through the living room wall ! No ! You are not gonna take me ever again ! You 're not gonna take me ! You 're not ! ( Charlie sobbing ) Charlie . There 's no reason at all why you should believe me . So I 'm gonna get proof , and I 'm gonna show you and anyone else who will listen that I 'm not crazy . Okay , Charlie . Okay . It took us almost two months before we found her . Something wrong with your system ? No , the system 's fine . She just doesn 't have an implant . Why would she ? She 's Jacob Clarke 's daughter . What do you do for an amputee ? You build them a fake hand . From their point of view , we 'd be psychic amputees . We 're missing something they take for granted . So what did they give us ? Implants . They 've given us electronic versions of what they have biologically . Pull up the images of the brain tissue samples we took from that fire in Alaska . Spectrographic analysis turned up some weird trace compounds . Colour code for density threshold . This sample comes from the brain of that twin who died in the fire with your brother . The twins were failed attempts at crossbreeding , but we worked from the assumption their cellular structure is almost identical to Lisa 's . Good . Now zoom out . The tissue is doing double duty- - spirals of neurons acting as antennae . We found her . She was just broadcasting on another frequency . ( rock music blares ) ( chattering ) Hey , dude ! Bye . Hey , Lisa , how you doing ? We got so much to talk about . Don 't stand there- - do something ! Unh ! The national edition of the New York Times. please . ( dialing ) I 'd like to place an ad in the personals . TOM : I never told anyone about your father . I didn 't put it in any of my books . But when Eric Crawford came after you , I should have told you . I don 't know if I would have believed you . So ... This Crawford came after me because I 'm ... One-quarter alien ? Does make you pretty interesting . Wow . From what I have experienced , and I 'm only talking about what I 've seen ... They don 't want to hurt anybody . They saved you . They walked you home . Your father was very important to them . And I guess that you are , too . I think I know why . CHET : These are the matched repeaters . We started with anyone who had been taken more than once . We noticed there was a subset- - People repeatedly taken on the same day as others . We found Charlie Keys . Let 's assume he 's part of pair number 55 . Why 55 ? Numbers thing . Go with me for a moment . Charlie 's last abduction , right after we started tracking him , came on September 8th . If we backdate Lisa 's pregnancy , we can give her a conception date of September 8th . They 're breeding him with a girl who 's ... One-quarter alien already . It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? I 'm not quite getting it . That 's ' cause you don 't have my years of experience in the private sector . See , in the biotech world , most of our research goes into recessive traits- - things we can breed out of a species or into it . What do we know about the Keys family ? The grandfather , Russell , is a bomber pilot . His son is a Vietnam vet and rescue worker . These men are strong , brave , extremely resilient . One other thing- - When they 're taken , they fight back . And the Clarkes- - Jacob , he could do things . My father was terrified of him . But he was physically weak . In a way , he was no more suited to survive than those mutant brothers in the Alaskan woods . And Lisa ... And Lisa , she doesn 't seem to have inherited her father 's gifts or his physical weakness . She seems to be nothing more than a carrier . - You ever cook with tarragon ? - Hmm ? It 's a very strong spice . One pinch is all you need . Otherwise , it overpowers the dish you 're making . Genetics is a lot like cooking- - little pinch of this , little more of that . But what are they cooking ? That , my son and heir , is one hell of a whopper , isn 't it ? Super weapon or saviour , take your pick . ALLIE : Sometimes the best way to move into the unknown is to take familiar steps . small steps . to do ordinary things to deal with something that is in no way ordinary . We 're always going someplace new. all the time . Familiar things just let us pretend that we aren 't moving into unfamiliar territory . You take those small. familiar steps . and you try to be honest . not to live as if nothing had changed . but still to go on with your life . But there are times when what you need is a piece of how things used to be . Aah ! Mum ! ( Laughing ) Nina ! This guitar player , Tony ... I was auditioning for his band . I don 't think I like this guitar player . I went back to the rehearsal studio the next day to see him . He 'd left for L.A. Prick . No , that 's not what I mean at all . He 'd left for L.A. right from the rehearsal studio that night . A friend of his came by and got him . He hadn 't followed me home at all . Well , you went home with somebody . No , I didn 't . Honey , come home . The people you were hiding from , the same people who were looking for your father , Tom says they know where you are . They 're not gonna bother me . Because beings from another world are looking out for you ? Yes , mum . That 's exactly why . You weren 't here . You didn 't see what happened to me . Mum , l- - Mum . This is gonna be all right . I know it . I can feel it . You can , can 't you ? You 're your father 's daughter . You know that . Sooner or later , you two are gonna have to tell me what this is all about . It started when I was eight . I used to have these ... at the time , I thought they were dreams . There was always the same guy ... ( speaking Spanish ) What 's he saying ? " The craft are leaving . " This man is a farmer in Tierra Del Fuego . He 's reported sightings for the past eight years . We think many of the craft stay out of sight around the Antarctic . One day , two weeks ago , he sees the ships , sky full of them , all above his field , middle of the day . Then that 's it . Hasn 't seen ' em since . Woman from Siberia has a similar story . And Norway , Alaska , Zanzibar , Australia . 144 multi-witness , confirmable reports from all over the world . How long has this been going on ? About six weeks now . One big rush , then zilch . Absolutely no activity . Not one sighting . Nothing . Six weeks , and you never mentioned this to me ? - I 'm mentioning it now . - This is still my project . Abso-friggin ' - lutely . Eric , this is me , Chet . We 've been through the wars , buddy . I was just giving you a little space , Letting you come to terms with your divorce and all . How you liking the single life , by the way ? What do you think this means ? It 's the calm . The calm ? Yeah . The one that comes before the storm . ( guitar being strummed ) MAN : Speculation continues in the Pacific Northwest over the many reports of lights in the sky . The government will neither confirm nor deny the rumours ... They 're beautiful . ... of secret aircraft being tested as part of a new Strategic Defence Initiative recently funded by Congress ... It 's gonna be okay . Is it ? Definitely . What if there 's something wrong with the baby ? Honey , really . It 's gonna be great . No , it 's not that . I think my water just broke . ( panting ) You 're gonna be all right . Yeah . ( panting ) Less than a minute apart . Will you call my mum ? ( both giggle ) CHET : Good , here 's the general . Gentlemen . General . We feed directly off the Cheyenne Mountain computer . This grid shows the actions of every known man-made object in space- - screws from a 1 984 shuttle mission , a screwdriver the Russians dropped off Mir . and thousands- - thousands--of satellites . You didn 't bring us up from Washington to see screws . We 've had unidentified before , but nothing like this . Look . We eliminate the ones we 've I.D. ' d , and we 're left with these . Earlier tonight , there were hundreds of new objects . We thought the system had gone down . And then the objects ... coalesced . That 's the only way I know how to explain it . There were lots of little ones , and now there 's one very , very big one . You 'd better have a good cover story , General . No one 's gonna believe this is marsh gas . - That 's right , a little more . - There you go . Can you scootch up a little ? ( grunting ) What do you have in the way of drugs ? See if the doctor 's available . The mother 's b.p. is high . You 'll feel better in a couple of minutes . She 's nine centimeters . Stop pushing . I can 't . Listen to me , you have to stop . We have to bring your blood pressure down before you can have this baby . Get Dr Catrell . You 'll have to step out . It 's a slight complication . - What 's going on ? - You have to go now ! ( moaning ) Sir , it 's coming down . Surface velocity , 388.1 meters per second at 249.4 degrees local . Altitude , - 75.2 meters per second . Deinclination and speed on this thing- - they 're impossible . It 's over Seattle and coming down fast . Flash alert to CINC-NORAD . Move to Defcon 2 . If it 's what I think it is , none of that 'll matter . Her blood pressure 's 200 over 1 00 . She 's had two seizures . There 's protein in her urine . She 's eclamptic . Let 's stabilize her . Two grams magnesium , five milligrams hydralazine . Altitude , - 37.0 meters per second . 54.4 at 231.2 , alt - 33.6 . 52.8 at 229.0 , alt - 30.1 . What 's happening to you is called eclampsia , but we 've treated your seizures , and we 're bringing down your blood pressure . Why is this happening ? 52.8 at 229.0 , alt - 30.1 . 51.2 at 227.8 , alt - 26.7 . It 's slowing down . It 's levelling out . - She 's stabilizing . - Okay , very nice . - No sign of foetal distress . - Here comes another contraction . If you can work with me , we can bring this baby into the world without a C-section , okay ? - Yeah . - Okay . We 're gonna try some pushing . 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... and push ! Push , push , push , push ! Okay , good girl . Stop . Nice job , Lisa . Vitals ? B.P ' . s down to 1 20 . She 's stabilizing . Very nice . We 're gonna do it again , Lisa , okay ? 30.6 meters per second at 21 3.8 degrees local . Altitude , - 9.3 meters per second . Great . Let 's just wait for another contraction . Just a second , and we 'll go again . Ready ? On three . 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... push ! Push , push , push , push . - Stop ! - Vitals still stable . Way to go , Lisa ! Estimated hover point- - 47-39-1 4 north , 1 22-1 8-34 west . You 're almost there . Just a few more pushes , okay ? Oh , my God . My God ! Why is there so much blood ? It 's all right . Doctor , there 's foetal distress . I 'm taking this baby now . Forceps . Prep suction . She 's in D.I.C. She 's bleeding out ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! We 're losing the baby , too . 25.2 at 21 1.0 , alt - 4.9 . It--it stopped ! It 's disappeared . What ? It 's gone . It can 't be gone . We have the mother 's heartbeat . Baby is stabilizing . She 's stopped bleeding . I want a teal-amber search , code red , right now . Go . Find the damn thing . Go ! ( baby crying ) Hey . Hey . You 're not supposed to be here , you know . You were bleeding to death . What happened ? The bleeding stopped . Nobody knows why . I told you they 'd look over you . My baby ? She 's beautiful . Seven pounds , three ounces . Perfect little baby girl . ( cooing to baby ) Oh ... hi . NINA : Do you know what you 're gonna name her ? Allison . Allie . Her name is Allie . Hey there , Allie . ALLIE : My mum says that life is like a roller-coaster ride . There are ups and downs . there are big scares and slow builds and places where it levels out . The only difference with this roller coaster is that every time it stops . you get off in someplace totally different from where you got on . How 's your mother ? She 's fine . She does not send you her love . Thanks for coming . You said it was important . Your grandfather found this in Pine Lodge , New Mexico . He found it at a crash site . So it 's all true . What does it say ? No one 's been able to translate it . Maybe it 's a grocery list . He gave it to you ? Your father ? Left it for me . I found it after he died . And there was a note . My father and I ... We weren 't very close . Well , he left this for you . He must have changed his mind . My brother died . And your father just after that . Before he died , I think my father got a better look at me . What does Uncle Chet say about this ? Dr Wakeman hasn 't seen it . Why are you showing it to me now ? There 's a great deal of power that comes with the kind of knowledge I 'm privy to . I anticipate change . I want you to join me in the program , Mary . This is something that shouldn 't go outside the family . CHET : Hello , Thrill seekers . Look at you , little Mary , all grown up and beautiful ! How 's the quest for the Nobel Prize coming ? I got very close on a genomic mismatch scanning technique . " Close " like " should Miss America fail to fulfill her duties " close ? Close as in Patrick Brown got there first . You 're just a grad student . You 'll get there . Lisa had her baby . Little girl . Are we going to try to pick her up ? What would be the point in that ? God ! I 've been wanting to do this since you were 1 3 . Me , too . Why don 't you pick up the baby ? You don 't waste any time , do you ? She 's clearly important . In fact , I 'd say she 's the point of all this . Definitely . - So pick her up . - Take her . No , they 'd just take her back . They 're way better at that than we are . So what are we gonna do ? We watch and wait . And we figure out a way to take her that will work . Watch and wait . That sounds a lot like my father . I 'm nothing like your father ! I have a theory about who she is . You want to hear it ? Evolution tends to eliminate , or at least , uh ... Subjugate emotion . The limbic brain is still down there . But it 's way ... Down ... under . Why we don 't run through the streets killing people- - at least most of us . ( giggles ) Imagine their abilities combined with the energy of our strong emotion . They 'd be cherry bombs ... she 'd be a nuclear explosion . MAN : Ladies and gentlemen , may I present to you White Shadow . White Shadow comes to us after spending the last three years jumping through a flaming hoop at a sea show in Florida . Hopefully , over time , as we come to know and understand these creatures a little better , we 'll become more caring and compassionate in our behaviour towards them . Here at the aquarium , it is our hope that we can bring you that one step closer to truly knowing another species . Any questions ? Once the dolphin 's been in captivity , is it possible to return the animal to its native environment ? Not in most cases , although it depends on how long the animal has been away and under what conditions it was kept , but in most cases , once an animal has been taken , there 's little hope of an uneventful return . What 's the matter with them ? I remember the first time that I ever saw dolphins . I was three . It was the first time in my life I can remember knowing that something was beautiful ... and it was the first time I had the feeling there was something about me that was different from everybody else . - Are you about ready , Patty ? - Ready . ( clears throat ) Okay . We were coming back from a fishing trip , and we 're on Highway 89 coming out of Tahoe City . It wasn 't a fishing trip . You always tell it as a fishing trip . We 'd gone to visit the Nortons . No , no , no . We didn 't visit the Nortons . We were fishing Echo Lake . There was no fishing on this trip . One of the most memorable nights of your life , and you don 't remember- - - I know I wasn 't fishing . - Can I finish telling the man the story ? I 'm not saying don 't tell him . " Get your facts straight , " is all I 'm saying . You know what ? She always does this to me . Anyway , we 're coming down Highway 89 from Tahoe City- - you 're not gonna argue about it being Highway 89 ? Why would I ? God . Anyway , so I look at my watch , and it 's 7.30 , and then , all of a sudden- - All of a sudden , there 's this blinding flash . I mean ... you know what it 's like when you stare into the sun when you were a kid ? It was a lot brighter than that . Why would he have stared at the sun ? - Most kids do . - I never did . Well , aren 't we the second coming ? - Can I finish the story ? - Who 's stopping you ? You are , dear . Anyway , this light , it doesn 't even pass over us , but more like through us , and then it 's up in the sky , and then it goes down behind these pine trees , so we stop the car and we get out , we got this glowing behind the trees , and we have no idea what it is- - My Mike was so brave . - Well , you were , sweetheart . - I didn 't do anything . You took my hand and told me not to worry . Yeah , well , anybody would 've done that . Oh , no , they wouldn 't have . So , anyway , this light starts coming through the trees , and then the car dies . We 're up on this mountain , and my car goes dead . We got curved roads , we got a steep drop-off , engine won 't start , I 've got no steering , but here 's the funny thing , see- - with this light coming at us , I don 't care because I know that we 're gonna be all right . The next thing we know , we 're driving down Walnut Street and pulling up in front of our house . It 's 5.00 in the morning . The sky is just starting to get pink . We 're at the top of that hill at 7.30 at night , we didn 't get to the bottom till 5.00 in the morning , more than nine hours later . And this is all just what happened that night . It wasn 't till about three months later that Mike started having the dreams . You know , you wouldn 't think that dreams could scare you , but mine got so bad , I wouldn 't go to sleep . I was having them , too , but neither of us were talking about it , so neither of us knew what the other was dreaming . We 'd just be sitting there watching TV , trying not to fall asleep , not knowing what was on the other person 's mind . It wasn 't until we got sent to that hypnotherapies Dr Fulton . That 's when we both remembered where we 'd been that night for that nine and a half hours and who we 'd been with . This is a picture Mike drew when Dr Fulton asked him under hypnosis what happened to us on the road that night . And that there ... is a picture that Patty drew when the doc asked her the same question . This is the truth of it , and there can be no doubt- - is that my wife Patricia and I were taken by aliens . We 've been interviewed quite a few times . You seem to have more than just a passing interest in this . Do you have your own story ? ( Loud laughter echoing ) ( screams ) ALLIE : If a dream is just a dream . something that happens in your mind while you 're asleep . then that 's all right . It 's yours to take with you into the morning . and it fades away there in the light . But when the dreams start to come while you 're awake . and they come with the light . then that is not all right . What we look for then is other people who have dreamed what we 've dreamed . who have seen what we 've seen . When the dreams become real . sometimes the only comfort you can find is in knowing that you 're not alone . LISA SINGING TO RADIO : # I caught up with my ex-boyfriend # # You 're the reason I 'm in this mess # # And when they show up # # I 'll give them what you said # # Your address # I just get to this place where I feel like it is so totally out of my control . I just don 't see the point . It all ends , anyway , right ? So why bother ? I get up every day , all I see is the end of the day , and I just--I 'm not into doing anything at all . I--I could use some help with that . When you play a song , when you 're right in the middle , are you thinking about how the song ends ? No way . It 's all I can do to get through a song just staying focused right where I am . Oh ... okay . Okay . Thank you . Dude , this little girl 's profound . Hi , Mum . Hey .

It doesn 't really matter how you got there . The important part is . you 're seeing something new and different . # This is the heart of nowhere # - Morning . - Morning . Rough waters out there . MARY : This new footage of Allie just came in from our man in Seattle . ERIC : She can block a shot on goal , but other than that , she hasn 't demonstrated any of the kind of powers we were expecting . She 's a little kid . Give her time . A lot of genetic traits don 't demonstrate until just before adolescence . Schizophrenia , for example . We still can 't pick her up . They 'll just take her back like they did when we tried for Lisa . - That used to be the case . - " Used to be " ? Wanna see what we can do ? Step this way . Microwave radiation- - that part of the light spectrum , in the case of the oven , 1 2.5 centimetres , to be exact . We block that wavelength , and the hamster 's on easy street . But we let that same wavelength through ... Jeez . In meditation , we learn the oneness of all things , the harmony that flows through nature . This is the same idea , stripped of the comforting notion of divinity , that we find in science , more specifically in mathematics . One , one , two , three , five , eight . The Fibonacci Sequence . One number added to the one before it makes the next number in the sequence , and from this sequence , we get the golden mean . We find these numbers everywhere- - shells , nebulae , the spiral of a pine cone , bee hives ... DNA . God 's equation writ large across the heavens . The cow grazing contentedly in the meadow , the grass on which she grazes , the breeze that blows through . All parts of the one , the whole . - Is this going somewhere ? - Their crafts hold five . Add the number of confirmed sightings in New Mexico last year--1,597 . They have three fingers , one thumb . The number of breeding pairs you charted last year when you were figuring out who Allie was--55 . 1 , 3 , 5 , 55 , 1,597 . All Fibonacci numbers . How many lights on the board ? 46,367 . - And with our little friend Allie ? - 46,368 . The 24th Fibonacci . So , how do we take our revelation and turn it into an effective block so that we can grab little 46,368- - our little Allie ? WAKEMAN : This is Peter Miller . Mr Miller 's been taken 1 3 times . Oh , don 't worry . I 'm not gonna splatter him all over the room . Janitorial would never forgive me . Mr Miller has an implant . We 're monitoring it . You can see it right here on the map . Topeka , Montpelier , Somerset , Augusta . There we are- - Ellsworth , Maine . Right here . The implants broadcast on a spread spectrum . The frequencies are all based around the hydrogen hyperfine transition line , the most fundamental wavelength in the universe . Check this out . We block those frequencies , and in much the same manner as the hamster didn 't splatter , the implant doesn 't register . If we wanna pick someone up , we ought to be able to do it without having them grabbed right back . Will this work on the girl ? Allie has no implant . She doesn 't need one . She 's got the neuron spiral . But the same principle applies . We can block her frequency , too . And they can 't find her . Okay , let 's pick her up before she demonstrates . After that , we may not be able to . We 're sure she hasn 't demonstrated at all yet , right ? Not according to our agent . You know that therapy group her mother 's in ? We have someone in that group . Good . MAN : I believe this all has to do with the landing strip at the bottom of Lake Superior . You look at the contrails . As soon as they appeared in the sky above St. Paul , the incidence of severe upper respiratory infection quadrupled in the twin cities . These trails are messages . WOMAN : You 're reaching there . The idea of group is to listen . We 're not judging each other . I think you 're reaching here , Ray . There is a base and a landing strip at the bottom of Lake Superior . That 's why the government has spread this cover story about pollution in the lake , to keep the curious away . And those contrails , they are messages to the denizens of this base . WOMAN : Where do you get your information , Ray ? I was taken there on my third abduction . How come you didn 't drown ? RAY : They did something that enabled me to breathe underwater . That makes sense . We 're to believe your story about seeing your dead son on a spaceship , but I can 't go to the bottom of Lake Superior ? - I didn 't say I didn 't believe you . - It was on your face . The doubt . I was thinking about my own experience about my boy . Can you share some of that story with us , Dale ? We lost our son Luke in the Gulf War , Desert Storm . They got names for these things like movies , but this was no damn movie . This wasn 't anything that made any sense . He was driving in a truck , taking supplies somewhere in the desert . The war was already over . There was a mine . No one ever knew if it was theirs or ours . About six months after we got the news about Luke is when they first came for me . I woke up , and there were these five young men standing by my bed . Soldiers , just like my boy . They asked me if I wanted to see Luke , and I don 't remember anything else until I was in this big , bright room . And Luke was there . And we were talking . We ... had had this fight , Luke and I . You know , like boys and fathers do , then he went into the army before we had a chance to make it right . But there we were , talking like there was no tomorrow . They would come for me every night , these same soldiers . At first , I 'd just sit and talk with my son- - how are the Mariners doing , and what 's going on down at the plant ? That sort of thing . It was wonderful ... to see my boy again . But then they started taking him away . We 'd be talking , and then , uh , he 'd be gone . It was as if they wanted to see what would happen if they could make me grieve again . Sometimes we 'd start to fight , having that same fight . Your son 's dead . You 're having bad dreams , that 's all . DALE : That 's what my wife said . WOMAN : That 's why the two of you separated , isn 't it ? That was just an excuse . Truth of it was , we couldn 't stand to look at each other anymore . All either one of us could see was Luke . You were a jerk to him , and you feel bad about it now that it 's too late , and it 's not something you can fix . Do these look like dreams to you ? Is that what you 'd name them ? That could 've happened any way . You could 've done it to yourself . Please . Please , Dale , sit down . Sit down . Now , you 're here , you 're all here because you believe you 've experienced something . This is hard work , it 's painful work , but we can get through it if we work together , all right ? Good . Why don 't you believe my experience ? You 've been taken . You know how it works . Just offering alternatives . ( door opens ) Sorry , everybody . I had to drop off Allie at soccer practice . Lisa , we have a guest today . This is Charlie . Charlie 's been videotaping the session for a documentary he 's doing . He 's been interviewing people all around the country who 've had experiences like all of yours , and now he 's found his way to us . The rest of us have agreed to allow ourselves to be put on tape , but ... if you 're not comfortable with that , then- - No , I 'm not . - Turn that off , please . - Sorry . I just try to keep my life private . I 'm sorry . I understand . Do I ... Did Dorothy share today ? She thinks her cats are aliens . Do they live at the bottom of Lake Superior ? That 's the nice thing about being in the group . It makes me feel positively normal . ( chuckles ) You 're doing a documentary ? Not exactly . I 've ... had experiences myself . How long have they been taking you ? Since I was a kid . I didn 't really know what was going on until I 'd grown up , but ... since I was a kid . Me , too . They don 't take me anymore . They haven 't in nine years . And what I 've been trying to do since then is prove that it really happened , figure out why they stopped . I 'd just stick to the story about being a documentary filmmaker . Did ... did you like your abductions ? CHARLIE : Like them ? Yeah , as in look forward to ' em , enjoy ' em ? For me , it was always that . I used to get this buzz , this energy thing . It felt great . I believe this whole abduction deal is gonna turn out to be a positive event . Right now , people think we 're whack , fringe dwellers , but that 's gonna change . We 've been chosen for something . This thing busts open , we 're gonna be the folks to see . For me , it was never a buzz , anything like that . I didn 't know what was happening to me , and I fought back as hard as I could . Really ? I--I should get going . My daughter 'll be home soon from soccer practice . You have a daughter ? Allie . She 's nine . You have any pictures of yourself as a kid ? - You think it goes back that far ? - Why not ? Yeah , I have one of me and my mum . She 's pretty . Oh , that 's my dad . That 's him as a little kid with my grandfather . You would agree with me this whole thing 's kind of weird , right ? Well , it just got a whole lot weirder . This is the guy . I 've never come across anything like this . It 's extraordinary . This is your father ? He had been taken , too ? - It started with my grandfather . - It seems to run in families . We call these " screen memories . " It 's as if they take a sample of our memories and choose the realities they present us with . This was something , this carnival , that scared my father . And they used it . That 's not an uncommon part of the experience . But this ... to take a sample of your father 's memory and use it as a screen on both of you ? Why , it 's ... truly remarkable . I thought you 'd like it . I 'd like to regress you both , take you back to one of your abductions , see if we can figure out what this is all about , maybe even find out where the two of you met . Lisa , I think it might help Charlie if you and I were to work together first . With this new information , I might take you in a completely different direction . - Anytime . - How about now ? Do you mind if Charlie stays ? We ... do seem to have a lot in common . ( piano music plays softly ) I guess we should 've gone home and changed first . I don 't care if you don 't . Doesn 't bother me at all . Have you ever been here before ? My dad took me here when I was a kid . Hope I remember which fork to use . With me and my mum , it was mostly pizza . Where 's your mum now ? Detroit . She 's a nurse . That 's how she met my dad . - Was he a doctor ? - He was a patient . How about you ? What does your dad do ? My dad died when I was eight . I 'm sorry . My stepdad , he 's a musician , a guitarist . My mum 's a nutritionist . She could tell you not to eat anything they serve here . My real dad- - you use a computer ? Sure . He invented the buzz control scheme and half of the floating point logic . I thought , with our luck , we 'd wind up in a carnival . This is kind of like a carnival . - To us . - Us . - Hi . - Hi . - I 'm Charlie . - Okay . You 're in the third grade , right ? You 're doing State History ? You 're reading Sarah . Plain and Tall ? This is the " big ideas " year in science- - electricity , magnetism . I taught third grade the last three years . We read Sarah . Plain and Tall last year . This year , it 's Island of the Blue Dolphins . CHARLIE : It 's a good one . So this is the year I find out how everything works ? - The " big ideas " ? - Mm-hmm . And everybody takes these classes ? CHARLIE : Pretty much . So then what happens , they all forget ? I never thought about it like that- - LISA : Sorry , Al . I had to park all the way over by Parson Gardens . You 're cute . Where 's Lisa ? She , uh- - Lisa 's getting garlic . Hey , girls . How was soccer practice ? I 'm trying to convince my god-daughter she doesn 't want to play goalie . It 's either boring , boring , boring or , oh , my God , oh , my God . I don 't think it 's so boring . You get to watch the play come to you . And then it gets there , and oh , my God , oh , my God . Not if you 've been watching the play . There 's no getting around you . Who are you ? We 've been trying to figure that out all day . - Oh , another day-tripper ? - It 's ... a long story . For which I don 't have time . I 've got four freshmen who want Celtic bands and a concept artist who designed his own tattoo . He says it goes across his face to cover the lie . I 'm gonna be up all night . I do tattoos . Oh . You should get Lisa to show you her alien . You know , you really are cute . I bet I 'm gonna be seeing you around . Will you take a picture of his face once you 've covered up the lie ? Without question . Good-bye , sweetheart . Bye . I guess Charlie 's staying for dinner . Maybe if you 're real good , he 'll help you set the table . Did I hear you say you 're a schoolteacher ? I was , yeah . What happened ? I got a little too interested in other things . You 've been on the spaceships , too ? At first , I wondered if I should tell her , but it would 've been weirder to try and go to the group without even mentioning it . Yes , I have . Was it scary ? Kind of . Did it make you mean ? I don 't think so . How come ? My mum didn 't get mean , either . But some of the people she knows did . I think people get mean when they 're scared . You 're working late . Just wanna make sure there 's nothing I missed . In this light , you look like my father . You have his singleness of vision , something I never had . I envy you for that . I just wanna see this through . That 's what I mean . She just looks like a little girl , doesn 't she ? She doesn 't look special at all . This is Brad . This is Devon . And this is Rich . He 's the cutest . LISA : She does this just to humiliate me . I 'm nine . I 'm supposed to like this stuff . I like this song . This Alayna one 's really good , too . Oh , my God , man , the both of you ... I drive a lot , I listen to the radio . I like these guys . What am I gonna do , brand my own child with a scarlet " L " ? " L " ? For " lame . " # Every time I press rewind # # Stop when the red light flashes # # Upsy-daisy , my whole world crashes # That 's my journal . I write down things I think of and stuff . Oh , that 's a good idea . I always wished I 'd done that , but every time I start , I kind of get too lazy . Maybe sometime I could read you mine . That 'd be great . You 're up next , you know . Up next ? Your regression with Harriet . You 're next . You 've never done it before , have you ? Sometimes that can be a lot of information , just so you know . # Talk to me and help me understand # # Tell me how my eye got black and blue # ALLIE : I grew up . just my mum and me . I never thought a lot about who my father was or where he 'd gone . I guess I knew there was something missing . but when you 're a kid . your life is just your life . You don 't think about all the other ways it might have been . - Allie ? - Hi , Mr Watson . Is your mum inside ? Guess I 'm a little early . I get cooped up in my apartment . Guess I just need to get out . Your son Luke ... He loved you very much . Why did you say that ? I just thought you should know . Thank you , sweetheart . Thank you very much . I think. when you 're older . what gets hard is that you forget how to take things as they come . And sometimes . the things that do come are more than anyone should have to take . GIRL : Come on , guys ! NINA : Keep your feet moving . Don 't get stuck in one place . All right , let 's get two passes . Good . Good . Nice pass . Nice pass . Good . That boy 's going down . NINA : Heads up , Allie ! NINA : Okay , we got it back . Good . Good work , girls . Allie and I are very ... close . - How do you wanna tell her ? - l-I don 't know . I don 't know if I wanna tell her . She has to know . No , she doesn 't . We 're doing fine here . Allie and me are fine . I don 't know you . I don 't know if I want you to be her father . Yes ! She 's a beautiful little girl . Does she even wanna know who her dad is ? - I mean , does she ask about that ? - Sometimes . What do you tell her ? That he was a nice guy , that I didn 't know him very well , that sometimes people can mean a lot to each other for a short time . And she doesn 't even ask to see him ? No ... she doesn 't . I-I knew--I mean , I didn 't know you , but I knew she was ... damn it . I go around pretending I 'm cool with all of this , and I have to tell you , I 'm not cool with it at all . What are they doing ? What do they want out of all this ? WAKEMAN : They wanna make us better to enable us to move to the next rung of the ladder , and in doing that , they 'll better themselves as well . MARY : I have another idea . Say it began as a research project , a project on a scale completely beyond our imagination , a detailed accounting of our entire planet . A history of the planet , a catalogue of everything . Now imagine this--while they 're doing this research , this cataloguing , they inadvertently come across an incredible insight , something that utterly transforms the way they see the universe . And that 's what Allie is- - the result of this insight . Yeah , but they 're smarter than us . They can do things we can 't even begin to understand . - They 're more highly evolved . - Evolution has a cost . Every choice is the death of all other possibilities . Maybe something was lost along the way . Yeah , probably something very simple . Possibly . And now they 've put it back . Maybe . Maybe it 's become something more than that . From the first time I set foot in that room in Groom Lake , saw that body , all I 've ever wanted was to understand them , to see through their eyes , just ... catch a glimpse . I feel kind of- - I 've never said this to anyone- - but I feel this sense of being with them . We are so close , Mary . We 'll have the girl . And through her , we 'll be able to talk to them . I 've waited my entire life for this moment . I-I 'm an arrogant bastard . I always knew I 'd get there in the end . I always knew . What I never knew , what I had no idea about , was that I 'd find someone to share the moment with me . ( cell phone rings ) Yeah ? Hello . Oh . Well , that is quite a surprise . Thank you very much . Um ... yeah , I look forward to seeing you as well . It is unexpected , but that is one of life 's great joys , isn 't it ? Happy accidents . Okay . There 's a new wrinkle . Allie 's dad just showed up . Well , that 's interesting . We 're gonna have to deal with that . MAN : I just can 't stand this feeling- - that my life is out of control , that someone else is pulling the strings . Welcome to the world . No one has control . Who could say ? They 're more advanced than us , but that doesn 't make them God . It does from where we 're sitting . What makes me furious , somebody has cut a deal with these guys . That has to be what 's happening . The government knows about this , and they 're covering it up in return for something . For what ? You always come back to that , but I just don 't see it . I think the government is just as confused as we are . Yeah , but you 'll give me this- - they know about it . RAY : Blah blah blah blah blah . You people . I mean , we 're all such victims . It 's time someone did something . I mean , they come into our homes , they take us up into their ships , they do things to us . And we just sit around here , and we talk about it . Ray , we talk about it because it helps . What else can we do ? With an attitude like that , nothing . It 's pathetic . You talk like we could fight back . I 've been taken so many times , I can 't count ' em . Fighting back is not an option . What about you , Ray ? Have you ever fought back ? Yeah , I-I-I 'd like to think that I have , but that 's not what I 'm talking about . There 's us here in this room , okay , fine . But those people out in the world , they treat us like we 're crazy . Like we 're making this up . If we 're all alone , then there 's no fighting back . But if we were believed ... if there was proof ... That was your idea , too , wasn 't it , Charlie ? - To get proof ? - It was , yeah . Not anymore ? Well , some things have come up that kind of rearrange my priorities . ( whistle blows ) All right , come on , girls . Come on downfield . Stick to the fundamentals . Watch your dribbling . Throw the ball . All right . Shoot ! Shoot ! Come on ! NINA : Good . Good . Remember the fundamentals . ( car door closes ) NINA : Good . Good . Make eye contact with the other players . If you 're making a checklist of superpowers ... that was a big one . She can manipulate time . Let 's get back to the cars . Have you told Allie ? We ... we 've talked about it , but we don 't know how to do it yet . We want to understand it first before we try to help her to understand it . If I know Allie , she probably could explain the whole thing to you . This is so romantic , really . Soul mates destined to find each other in the stars . You seem threatened by Lisa 's story , Ray . She always comes here with these warm and fuzzy little tales . It 's like aliens are bunny rabbits , like they 're nice or something . Why don 't you back off and let Lisa tell her story ? Hey , Charlie , I don 't need your help . I 've been doing fine without you for nine years . You wanna go with that , Lisa ? I think it would be fair to say you have a certain a normal resentment about being a single mother , even under these truly abnormal circumstances . I just don 't need anyone weighing in at the 11th hour thinking I need taking care of . ( scoffs ) Hey , don 't get all over me . I didn 't know I was a father until yesterday afternoon . I 'm not all over you . I 'm just saying I don 't need any help . Just because you haven 't had any doesn 't mean you don 't need it . Meaning ? Meaning you 're living in a small apartment , supporting yourself and Allie by playing drums in a band . You could use a little help . What the hell do you know about how I 'm living ? I know what I see . You have nothing to say about it , not about me and not about my daughter . RAY : Hey , Lisa , I got a question . Which story do you think Allie 's gonna like better- - Mummy got nailed by some loser musician , or Mummy and Daddy never met , but did the nasty on a flying saucer ? Why do you come ? Why do you come if all you 're gonna do Is heap abuse on everybody ? Why ? So I can spend more time with you . Go to hell , Ray . Oh , I 've been , on more than one occasion . Why don 't you lighten up , buddy ? Why don 't I lighten up ? Because I am sick and tired of your cosmic girlfriend 's incessant whining . " My father was half alien . " Yeah . All that crap . Oh , you didn 't know about that , did you ? Yeah , one of these guys shows up in Grandma 's barn , knocks the old lady up . Nine months later , you got yourself a walking , talking hybrid . It 's a wonder your back 's not broken , the size of that chip you 're carrying around . You gonna be the one to knock it off ? Gentlemen , please . Harriet , I think we need to ask him to leave the group . He does nothing but cause trouble . We are all here to help each other . He 's not helping anybody . He 's just making things worse . I agree . You know , Ray , all you ever do is shoot down everyone 's stories , spreading trash , but we 've never heard too much about your close encounter . She 's got a point , Ray . Yeah , you said you fought back . Tell us about that . - Come on . - Tell us your story . What are you looking at ? Maybe you should answer their questions . EVERYONE : Yeah , come on , Ray . Tell us your story . You wanna hear my story ? Ray , sit down . Here 's my story . What are you doing ? ! Put your gun away , Ray . You don 't wanna do this . - Put the gun away ! - No , I don 't think so . I got a better idea . All right , everybody , get over in that corner . You stay away from the windows . Sit down on the floor where I can see you . Come on ! I 'll shoot the new boy first , then I 'll start in on the rest of you . Sit ! Ray , nobody 's getting shot here . That doesn 't have to happen . Oh , my God , he 's gonna shoot us . He 's not gonna shoot anybody . He 's just showing off . Is that what you think ? Is that what you truly believe ? Shoot me . See if I care . What are we doing here , Ray ? Hey ! I asked you to sit down . Get that thing out of my face . I 've been abducted by aliens . You think I care about your little toy trumpet ? ( group gasps ) RAY : You sit down , hero , or I will shoot your bride-to-be . DR PENZLER : Ray , I 'm sure if we talk about this , we can work it out . Ray , listen to Dr Penzler . It 's gonna be all right . DR PENZLER : Give me the gun . Give me the gun . Please , give it to her , Ray . ( phone rings ) ( people scream ) Can 't think with the phone ringing . Dorothy , get over to the window and shut the blinds . The rest of you stay put . Don 't do anything stupid . Come on , Dorothy ! All right , back with the others . ( cell phone rings ) What 's that ? Whose is that ? Is that you ? Yeah . - Answer it . - You sure ? Just don 't say anything stupid , huh ? Okay . Hello ? Ni-Ni-Nina , it 's really not a good time . Allie doesn 't run off , Nina . That 's not something she does . I-I can 't . It 's really hard to explain . - Hang up . - My daughter 's missing . - Hang up the phone . - You can just wait . Is she okay ? - Yeah , she 's all right . - How do you know ? I know . She 's scared , but she 's all right . Listen , Nina- - End the damn call , Lisa . Hang up now . ( gunshot , people scream ) Oh , my God . ( Charlie gasping ) ( group gasps ) Help me sit him up . DR PENZLER : It 's all right . Come on . - There you go . - Oh , my God . CHARLIE : Cellophane . - What ? - Cellophane . Cellophane . Somebody find some cellophane somewhere . All right , he 's got it . Get it off . I 've got a scarf ! I 've got a scarf ! Where are you going ? I 'm getting my scarf because you shot him , Ray ! Ray , Charlie is really hurt . We 've gotta get him to a hospital . I guess I wasn 't that much help to you after all , was I ? This doesn 't have to get any worse , Ray . Everything gets worse , Dr Penzler . Every stinking thing in this world . What are you gonna do ? Let me think ! I gotta think . Who else has a cell phone ? Um ... turn ' em off and slide ' em over to me . - Ray , it 's in my coat . - Go ahead . - What happens now , Ray ? - I 'm thinking . There 's no time , Ray . Charlie doesn 't have that kind of time . Okay ... I want you to call the FBI . You know which one of these is yours ? The little flip phone . This one ? What should I tell them ? The FBI , Ray . What should I tell them ? Um ... tell ' em I 'm armed , and I 'm gonna have to start shooting people if my demands aren 't met . Oh , God . We 're gonna die . We 're gonna die . Just shut up ! I 'm only gonna shoot you if they don 't do what I 'm asking them . - Ray ? - What ? What demands ? What are you asking them to do ? Tell ' em I wanna talk to the person in charge of their , um ... you know , whatever they call it , their--their extraterrestrial project . You want Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones ? Cynthia , you 're not helping . I 'm not sure who I should be asking for . Dr Penzler , just make the call . All right , all right . FBI , please . What are you gonna do once you get to somebody in charge ? I 'm gonna make my demands . You 're gonna call the federal government and say , " Let me speak to the man in charge of your super-secret operation because , if I don 't , I 'll shoot a few people " ? That 's pathetic is what that is . Well , no one ever said that Ray wasn 't pathetic . CYNTHIA : I knew I never should 've joined this damn group . This is like White people land . Do you know how many Asian people have been abducted since 1 947 ? Will you please shut up ? Maybe seven , and you 're looking at one of them . So I decide to be open and honest about it , and this is what I get- - I 'm abducted by Homer Simpson . White people land . Hello . Hello . Is this the--the FBI ? - You got ' em on the phone ? - Um , yes . Uh-huh . See ? This is , um , Dr Harriet Penzler . I 'm hoping you can help me . I have a bit of a problem here . DR PENZLER : Yes . Um , I have a group of people here , and one of them 's been shot . The--the man who shot him ... Lisa , what are you doing ? DR PENZLER : And , um ... hold on a minute . EVERYONE : Lisa ? Sit down . Where do you think you 're going ? Isn 't this sweet ? Now we got the whole happy family . Allie ... it 's okay . Come here . Come here . It 's okay . DR PENZLER : Ten adults and one child . That 's right , exactly . Sit down . Okay , here 's the thing . I don 't want any cops . I don 't want any hostage negotiator or any of that Dog Day Afternoon crap ... Everything 's gonna be okay . I 'm not gonna let anyone hurt you . RAY : One SWATteam or anything , I start shooting these people . Good . I want someone here in 1 5 minutes . There is a problem here right now , Allie , but it 's gonna be all right . Ray is just a little angry . " Ray is just a little angry " ? No , Ray is majorly pissed off . I mean , you should be angry , too . Look what they did to you and what 's-his-name--Charlie . Look at that ! I mean , how can you sit here and let that kind of thing go unanswered ? Come on , we don 't need to talk about that . What , we 're not supposed to tell Allie she 's a test-tube baby ? You sorry bastard . Hey ... Charlie 's hurt . Yeah . Is he going to be all right ? I don 't know , honey . If Ray will let us get him to the hospital ... No one 's going anywhere until I get what I want . ( knock on door ) GUARD : Campus security . Dr Penzler ? We had a report of a gunshot . Hands up . Get your hands up . Yeah , you keep ' em up there . Okay . Here 's the situation . I 'm holding these people hostage , all right ? I 've already shot one of them . I 'm angry and unpredictable . Look at me ! What we 're doing here , we 're waiting for the FBI . There 's two more security officers coming from other parts of the campus . Yeah , so ? What do you want me to do about them ? I want you to go out there and talk to them . I want you all to come up with something to clear this place out , okay ? Say something exploded , say anything you want . Just keep the world away from me till the FBI gets here , okay ? Hey , don 't be stupid . A lot of people are gonna get killed . You can go now . What are you doing , Ray ? What do you think you 're gonna get done ? We live in a world that 's out of our control . You should know that better than anyone . I mean , things happen , right ? What is that , God 's will ? The hell with that . We all feel that way sometimes- - Spare me the couch , Dr Penzler . I 'm not a crazy person . I mean , things really happen to me , and I 'm sick and tired of nobody believing me but you fruit loops . What am I gonna do ? Okay , so it 's very simple . The government is gonna come clean on national TV . They 're gonna tell the world this is all real , and then no one ... no one will ever think I 'm crazy again . Answer your question ? We do exactly what he wants . We clear the area , evacuate the building , keep the students and faculty safe . By then , the FBI will be here , and then it will all be their problem . - Start setting up the barricades . - Right away . Something frightened you . That 's why you came here ? I don 't really know what happened . There were some people . And you felt as if they were coming after you ? - And I started to run ... - But ? And then ... I don 't know what happened . You did something . I think so . GUARD : This way , folks . Come down this way as quickly as you can . SECOND GUARD : All right , folks , calmly . This way . Quickly as you can , please move down . Just follow them . Thank you . Right through the barricades there . That 's right . Do you wanna know what I 'm worried about ? I wanna know who 's gonna feed my cats . We 'll all be out of here soon . You 'll be home to feed them yourself . And what if that doesn 't happen ? Relax , Dorothy . The aliens 'll feed ' em . Yeah , they 're old friends of your cats , right ? What ? What are you looking at ? You really think if you 're cruel enough to other people , all your own misery will go away ? No . Just keeps my mind off it for a while . RAY : Gas trucks . Nice touch . ( tyres screech ) ( cell phone rings ) ( rings ) Answer it . Yes ? It 's for you . Sit down . Yeah ? Okay . I see you . What do I want ? How about a world cruise and a winning lottery ticket ? ( chuckles ) Why don 't you come up here ? We can talk about it . Just you . Your little friends can wait down there . Hey , sit down . What do you think you 're doing ? I 'm gonna get some ice for my neck because you hurt me . And tomorrow morning , after the FBI either lock you up or shoot you dead , I 'm gonna have to get up and go to work like any other day , and I 'd just as soon do that looking as fresh and pretty as possible . Get some water for Charlie , will you please , Cynthia ? CYNTHIA : Yeah . Anybody else ? - Is that okay ? - Yeah . Thanks . We got to get him out of here , Ray . Yeah ? Let 's just hope this lady coming up the stairs now feels the same way about that as you do . I felt good about this guy as soon as I saw him . LISA : Me , too . ( knock on door ) Answer it . Come on . Out of the way , Dr Penzler . Let me see her . Are you the one who asked for the FBI ? ( scoffs ) Yeah . I 'm here . You can talk to me . Did anyone tell you what this was all about ? Man in therapist 's office holding ten hostages demands FBI agent . I asked for someone from the FBI extraterrestrial project . Someone who knows about aliens . You mean , like on X-Files ? I 'm the one you want . RAY : Okay . Let me bring you up to speed on our situation here . I shot him . And he 's gonna die if he doesn 't get medical attention . That 's one . After that , if I don 't get what I ask for , these people , they 're just fish in a barrel to me , you understand that ? That was the lady in the park , the one who tried to grab me . RAY : You understand ? This is what I want you to do . I want you to go public . Go public ? Call the New York Times . call CNN . Tell ' em everything you know , tell ' em this is all real . You just signed our death warrant . - You think she cares about killing 11 - - - Shut up ! She 's not gonna call CNN , Ray . She 's gonna have us all killed . I can 't tell you how many times I 've wanted to make that call . My people have a very old-fashioned , Cold-War slant on things . It 's not right ... keeping something like this secret as I 'm sure everyone here would agree . This is news that belongs to the world . How do you know she 's from the government , Ray ? How do you know she 's not one of them ? Sit down . Why don 't you let the little girl come with me ? It 's the kind of gesture that would go a long way . Give me the girl , and I promise , I 'll do everything I can for you . WILSON : Look at the eyes , Ray . You see ? Those are alien eyes . RAY : Wilson , shut up . Let me have the girl . Let Allie go , Ray . She doesn 't have to get hurt . Allie , stand up . Stand up . You 've got something I want , now I 've got something you want . Get out . Get out ! MAN : Clear it off the south perimeter ! MAN : Here comes your dad . The rooms here also- - What 's the situation ? He 's gonna kill the girl unless we call CNN and tell the world we 're not alone . You two were going to pick her up . This was supposed to be easy . It got a little complicated . I 'm handling it . How ? I say what I have to , promise him anything he wants . Just make sure the girl doesn 't get hurt . No one 's going to get killed here today . - Hey . - Hey . You got a nice move to the post . That kid yesterday thought he could get one past you , but you were right there . What I do is I fool myself . I make myself believe I 'm really going to cover . Because I believe it , he believes it . How do you get yourself over to the post ? I don 't know . I 'm afraid if I ever stop to think about it , it won 't work anymore . Do you know why you 're here ? Do you know what this is about ? I 'm not sure yet , but I think we 're gonna find out soon . This is the year for the " big ideas , " right ? ( groans ) Hey ... hey . - I may pass out here . - No , you won 't . - Do you know CPR ? - Uh , n-no . You 're gonna need to take my right arm and put it across my chest . Okay . Make sure I don 't roll over . Then what do I do ? You 're gonna have to give me mouth-to-mouth . I 'm sorry I said those things about the way you live . I was scared . It 's like Allie said--people get mean when they get scared . All right . She 's a wonderful girl , Lisa . You did great . You want CNN here so badly , why don 't you call ' em yourself ? Because they 'd just think he was crazy , and he wants everyone to know that he isn 't crazy at all . ( cell phone rings ) Yeah ? Okay . The media 'll be here in 15 minutes . We 're almost home , fruit loops . ( gunshot ) ( everyone screams ) Get down . Who took that shot ? ( cell phone rings ) What the hell do you think you 're doing ? ! What 'd you think would happen if you tried something like that ? It was a miscommunication . I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . You 're damn right it won 't ! Next time something like that happens the little girl is coming out of the window with a bullet in her head . ERIC : Mary . Oh , what the hell , Ray ? Leave the little girl alone . You stay right there . You sad little man . Who do you think you are ? God ? You shut up . He 's not God , Dorothy . He 's just a poor excuse for a man . A man without any faith . Faith ? You 're gonna talk to me about faith ? God comes down and , pluck , there goes your son , no more Luke . Bye-bye . Why ? Dale , why ? Because He 's up in His Heaven and all 's right with the world ? Or because we live in a stinking sewer where nothing makes one bit of sense ? RAY : But you have faith . Your son dies for no reason , but you have faith . You get taken and tortured , but you have faith . ( Ray laughs ) If I didn 't , then I wouldn 't have any reason to go on living . Then you crawl away and you die , because this right here- - this is as much sense as the world will ever make . What are you doing ? I told you I didn 't want anyone killed . What am I doing ? I 'm trying to keep the little girl alive . I put a man up there , I told him if he had a clean shot , he should take it . And he missed , and we 'll be lucky to get her out alive . Pull everybody back . And do what ? What do you suggest ? We should call CNN for him ? This little girl is everything . She 's what it 's all about . We can 't afford to lose her . ( cell phone rings ) Yes . Ray . I am so sorry about what happened by the window . There are some people out here who 've seen too many Lethal Weapon movies . Look up at the window . You get me what I want . Do it now . RAY : Go sit down with your mum and dad . You don 't have to be scared , Mum . This is all going to be all right . A lot of things are going to happen because of this . That 's all . But it 's going to be all right . You better hope you 're right , or you 're gonna have to start praying for a little intervention from your grandfather 's side of the family . You 're not gonna get it any cleaner . He 's gonna kill her . We 've gotta take him out . I 'm not gonna be a party to any more killing , Mary . I 'm done with that . I don 't think you are , Dad . You know who 's in there , right , besides the little girl ? Her mother and her father--Charlie . That means he knows . And that 's two people with a lot of information that have had some pretty bad experiences with us over the years . They have to go . Dr Penzler , too . I can 't risk a leak . It 's too important . They don 't matter anymore . It 's all about Allie . You 're not in charge here , Mary . I am . Take a step back . Calm down . I 'm sorry . You 're right . Just , the two of them having gotten together has made me a little nervous . - They could really gum us up . - No one 's getting killed here , Mary . Of course not . CYNTHIA : I got to go to the bathroom . Grab a cup . Knock yourself out . Lisa , how 's he doing ? He 's still breathing . Are you all right ? I just don 't want any more bad news . Mr Watson ? Luke , when he died , he wasn 't mad at you anymore . DALE : He wasn 't ? He knew . It was just one of those things that happens . He was growing up , and that was hard for you both . He loved you very , very much , Mr Watson . And that 's what he was thinking when he died . I just wish I could see him one more time . I wish I could tell him that I was sorry . He knows , Mr Watson . He knows . ( cries ) It 's okay , Dad . You can let go . Now I can see why those people want you so badly . When it gets dark , we shoot for the windows again . At the same time , we bring two men through the hallway . He 'll be down on the floor , won 't be looking to the door . We 've got a man up in the heating ducts . He 'll coordinate by earphone , drop down through at the same time the two men from the hall enter . And then he turns and shoots the girl . That room is covered by snipers . These men know what they 're doing . It all goes by the numbers , we take him out . - And the others ? - Not a problem . I don 't want my father to see you do it . You look like a college kid doing his homework . - What are you working on ? - Oh , just a little theory . Their craft was , I like to call it , thought-powered . Allie may be a stronger manifestation of that power , that energy . How long have you been sleeping with my daughter ? About six years . You get some kind of sick pleasure from that , the boss ' daughter ? " Boss " ? I thought we were friends . I love Mary . And I think she loves me . I want your desk cleaned out by tomorrow . After this is over , I 'll be going back to Maine . I don 't wanna see you there when I go into the office . How you feeling ? What 's happening to me ? - It 's in her DNA , isn 't it ? - That 's what makes her special . Mum ... I never believed that part of your story- - " My grandfather was an alien . " - Allie ... - Your dad--could he do things ? I never saw it , but , yes , he could . - But you never could . - I can play drums and sing harmony . A lot of people would tell you that 's amazing . There 's you and me . The way I know where you are , how you 're feeling , if you 're safe . I always figured that was just because I 'm your only daughter and you love me so much . Yeah , I suppose it could be that . It 's what made your dad sick , isn 't it , doing these things ? You 're not my dad , honey . You 've got a lot of other things in you . You 've got Charlie 's family , too . MAN : Everybody in position ? He 's not gonna last much longer . You got a lot of hell on your plate . MAN : What are we doing here , Ray ? This man needs help . Are you just gonna sit there while he bleeds to death ? Nothing you do is going to change anything about what happened to you , Mr Morrison . What are you talking about ? That man in the woods when you were eight . The one that took you in that shed . He wasn 't from another planet . He was just mean and crazy . You shut up about that . You 're just going to hurt more people , that 's all . It 's not going to make what happened to you go away . Shut up ! - LISA : Allie ... - It would be easier , wouldn 't it ? Blame it on them . They came down and took you . You stop it . It 's a lot scarier to think that the monsters might be us . Shut up ! - Ray ! - You shut up right now ! Ray ! She doesn 't mean it ! She 's a little kid . She doesn 't know what she 's saying . DOROTHY : One day , you 're gonna stand in front of the Lord , and you 're gonna have to explain what happened here today . You are gonna have to explain . I 'm not the one who has the explaining to do . Dale 's son--explain that . Explain cancer . Explain war . Explain the whole damn thing to me just one time ... so I can understand why everything has to be so hard . ( sobs ) Oh , God . I 'm sorry I hurt him . Oh , God , I 'm so sorry . Allie ... LISA : Allie ... What are you doing , Allie ? Charlie ... Look at me . Look at me . Look at me , Dad . He 's all right ? What do you think we ought to do now ? ( cell phone rings ) Yes , Ray ? Hello . Ray ? No . This is Allie . We 're all going to come out of the building now . Please tell everybody not to shoot . I 'll go with you . All right . They 're coming down . She says she 'll come with us if we let the others go . Everybody set ? - Mary ... you can 't do this . - Do what ? You can 't kill anyone . What makes you think they 'll let you ? They don 't care about Lisa and Charlie now any more than we do . It 's all about Allie . Then where are they ? We tried to pick up Lisa . Lisa was helpless . Allie can take care of herself . Then what makes you think any of this will work ? I don 't know if it 's gonna work . At least I 'm not afraid to try . Mary , don 't do this . Listen to me . I-I know this . Walk away . Even if you lose the project , walk away ... before you do something you can 't walk away from . MAN : Here they come . Why don 't you just fade away ? You 're a burden to the project . You don 't have the stomach for it , and you don 't have the brains . You have no idea what I 'm capable of ? What I 've done ? I won 't have any more blood on my hands . Everybody set ? Get a tight lead on that subject . Run away ! Take the little girl ! It 's a trick ! Run ! It 's a trick ! WOMAN : Oh , my God . It 's okay . Come on ! I 'll take care of you . Come on . MARY : It 's okay . Keep coming . I 'll take care of you all . Come on . It 's okay . It 's all right . Keep coming . I 'll take care of you . Come on . ( Laughs ) ALLIE : Miss Crawford . I 'm ready to go with you now . Little girl ... I love the way your mind works . ALLIE : I guess I always knew that there was something different about me . But when all of this began to happen . when I started to be able to do things . it was kind of scary- - like in a dream where you start falling and it feels kind of good . until you begin to wonder if you 'll ever be able to stop . That was a good trick . You 're a very complicated little girl . What do you mean ? I mean , with what you can do , you could have walked out of that building . Why did you let us take you ? I wanted you to leave my mum and all the other people alone . I was afraid you might hurt someone . I thought if I went with you , they 'd be all right . Allie ? It 's 1 2.1 7 . We 've lost two hours . What ? We 've lost two hours . Are you all right ? Look , what I did--I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I 'm alive . We 're all alive . Everyone get out of here . Don 't go home . Find places where you 're gonna be safe . - Allie ? - Just get out of here ! Go ! LISA : Allie ! CHARLIE : Go ! LISA : Allie ? Allie ! Allie ! Lisa , she 's gone . She 's not here . Where did she go ? Where did they take her ? Allie ! Allie ! I 've got to find my daughter , please ! I know . Allie did this ... the time ... all of it . Allie gave us missing time ? Y-Y-Yes . She ... she stopped time . She stopped us , she stopped us and let time keep moving . She wanted to keep us safe , and she did that . She needed the missing time so that she could go with them without us trying to stop her . She was trying to keep us safe . ( radio plays ) ( knock on door ) I 'm coming ! Oh , thank God . I 've been worried sick ! I went by your apartment four times . I kept calling . What happened ? Are you all right ? ( voice breaking ) Allie 's gone . Do you know who I am ? Not exactly . Well ... um ... our families go way back- - mine and your mum 's and your dad 's . I kind of think that you and I might be the end of all this . We might just be the beginning . Your grandfather wasn 't a very happy man . Why are you trying so hard to be like him ? We 're almost to the airstrip . We better get this thing in place . ( moans ) Lisa . Lisa , it 's all right . Lisa . Baby . Lisa ! Lisa ! Lisa ! N-N-N-Nina ? I 'm right here . I 'm right in front of you . I can 't see anything ! I can 't see anything at all ! NINA : Lisa . Lisa ! ( Lisa moans loudly ) All right ? Can you see me now ? What happened to you ? I don 't know . I was ... somewhere else . I was somewhere else , and ... wherever it was , I couldn 't see a thing . She 's always been a- - she was a real good-looking baby right from the start . And really smart . At seven months ' old , she was already playing peek-a-boo . I 've got a video at home of her taking her first steps . You should see that . I 'd like to . We 've always had this link , you know , a connection . I 've always known exactly where she was , what she was thinking , how she was feeling . I 'd go to pick her up at school , I 'd stop off to get Tylenol ... she 'd walk out the building with a runny nose and a headache . Sounds silly , doesn 't it ? I mean , every mother has that . No , they don 't . Man , I 'm really , truly sorry . This is because Allie 's blessed , right ? These people that took her want to know what she 's all about . Yeah , pretty much . We 'll do whatever we can to help you get her back . I 've got a couple of shirts around that 'll fit you . Over the years , a girl winds up with a souvenir or two . Allie left this in the park when she ran away at soccer practice . 1 2 hours ago , there was a bullet in my lung . I should be dead . Why doesn 't it surprise me that you 're not ? She 's just a kid . She didn 't ask for any of this . She shouldn 't have to do any of this . It 's not fair ! It 's not fair at all ! We 'll get her back . How ? ALLIE : When you 've done something that you can 't take back . something that you don 't understand . you start to hold tightly to the things you do understand . and you try to make sense out of everything you can . Because if you believed that all you had to do to make things right was to find a reason . but what happens when you find the reasons and they are not your own ? How do you find any comfort or any sense in that ? They 're on their way . We haven 't had a chance to talk . What do you mean ? About your father . There 's nothing to say . You did what you had to do for the project . Ha Ha . " For the project . " When I was a kid , every time he went out of town , I used to imagine a car wreck , something like that , just how much better our lives would have been if he were gone . You 've been inside a craft . Many times , yeah- - that one at Groom Lake . That was beautiful ... wasn 't it ? Yeah . That was my family legacy . The craft , the bodies . My grandfather 's legacy . My father squandered all that . He had it right there in his hand , and he let it all slip away . He couldn 't stop them . He could have tried . You don 't feel any remorse , do you ? Do you think that makes me a bad person ? You did what you had to do . I heard about your father . I 'm sorry for your loss . It was a terribly unfortunate mistake . Mistake ? You 've got the girl ? She 's inside . So you really believe that thing you put on her head is blocking her signal ? Right now , they 're in their ship , scratching their little grey heads , going , " Where 's our girl ? " Then , when we take that shield off , here they come . You 're confident we can take them down ? Wherever they come from- - the most distant star , the furthest reaches of time- - the moment they enter our time and space , our reality , they 're confronted by the laws of our physics . You 're sure of that ? In 1 947 , in Roswell , New Mexico , a ship came down when it collided with a Mogul spy balloon--a balloon . Yeah , I 'm pretty damn sure . You done a fine job . We 're indebted to you . What is this ? SOLDIER : Charlie company , move out ! I 'd like to thank you on behalf of your country for your contribution to this effort . You 've done your part , Miss Crawford . The little girl 's a part of a military operation now . We 'll take it from here . For three generations , my family 's been preparing for this . I 've dedicated my career- - my life--to this . And don 't think we don 't appreciate it . In a matter of days , we may be able to set foot inside one of their craft , to meet these beings , to find out what this has all been about . If you think I 'm gonna stand by while you take that opportunity away from me , you 're out of your mind . You don 't really have a choice . You 've been benched . Go sit down . Grab some pine . What I 'd like you to do now ... I 'd like you to clean up the mess you made in Seattle . The doctor--she 's a liability . Marginalize her . And the girl 's parents--put them somewhere until this is over . Don 't want them stirring the pot . We have people for that . You mentioned your father 's death was a mistake . People spend the rest of their lives in prison for mistakes like that . Stay out of my way . You can ride with me , doctor . Brief me on the way . E-E-Excuse me ? We need your expertise . I 'm not giving you a choice here , doctor . Come on , let 's go . Now . Uh- - Milo and I , we drove everywhere . We 'd ask people in diners and in gas stations , and we got guys from every band we know doing the same thing . Nothing . What about taking this public ? They 're not gonna come after you with the whole world watching . I called Channel 4 news . I said my daughter was kidnapped by a super-secret government agency . They--they said I should call the police . I told them I didn 't think it would do any good , and they gave me another number- - for Highline West Psychiatric Hospital . We put an ad in the New York Times . That 's how Lisa gets in touch with her uncle . Tom will be calling us soon . I 'm cold . Shouldn 't be much longer . Thank you . Lisa . ( Allie 's voice ) I 'm scared , Charlie . I 'm very , very scared . Just how powerful is this little girl , doctor ? She 's demonstrated powers beyond anything we imagined . She can manipulate time , she has amazing abilities to screen , to project images from our minds . Just how powerful is she ? The question you should be asking is , why is she letting us take her anywhere at all ? You 've reached the voice mail for Dr Chet Wakeman . Dr Wakeman is out of range of this cellular device . Please leave a message . General Beers ' office . This is Mary Crawford . Can you reach the general for me ? I 'm sorry , Miss Crawford . He 's not available . Tell him I have new information he 'll want to hear about . ALLIE : We had come to the time I had always known was coming . I had always had this feeling that. one day . I would have to do something very hard . I just hoped that I could find a way to do it without anyone getting hurt . Sorry , sir . There 's been a toxic spill . You need to turn your vehicle around . No one 's allowed to go through . Let 's get the gate . How you doin ' in there ? I 'm all right . Can I ask you something ? I heard that you let them take you , that you came right up to them and said you 'd go with them . Uh-huh . I also heard that you can do things , kind of like magic or something . Is that true ? Yes . So you 've got all of that power , why didn 't you just stop them ? I was afraid they 'd hurt other people . You 're one brave little girl . I don 't feel very brave right now . Hey ... maybe later , I could come back with a book or something . Did you ever read Huckleberry Finn ? No , I never have . Well , I 've got my copy in my duffle . I always carry it with me . It was my mum 's favourite book . She 'd bake us Toll House cookies , and we 'd share the whole plate of them while she read . If it wouldn 't make you too sad to remember her ... I 'd like to hear the story . No , it wouldn 't make me sad at all . It would be nice to remember her . We 're calling the operation " Dropping the Dishes . " The three Humvees equipped with the missiles will be here , here , and here , camo nets above ' em . The target , gentlemen , will be in the air . It will be big . Observation posts here on the mountains for early warning . Two men to each O.P. We 're gonna try to take this thing down intact , sir ? That 's the plan . Once we get it down , sir , how do we find these guys ? Y 'all have seen the S-2 briefing video . You know as much as I do . All right , they can do some pretty incredible things . They 've taken people through walls . They can make you see things that are not there . But no problem , right ? We 're the best . Y 'all are about to fight an enemy the likes of which no soldier has ever seen . I can 't tell you how it will go , but I can tell you this- - you 're about to earn a place in history . She 's completely normal . No fluctuation in brain-wave pattern , nothing in her blood chemistry . Her biology is human . Of course it is . We won 't find anything . The part of her that isn 't human is capable of perfect mimicry . Then what are we looking for ? I don 't know . SOLDIER : Any questions ? Is there anything we can do to maximize our cone of fire , sir ? I 'd aim for the centre of the damn thing and pray . Any other questions ? Uh , General ? General . I need to talk to you about the little girl--Allie . Something wrong ? Her powers are just beginning to manifest . We need to protect her for further study . So you 're uncomfortable with the notion of using her for bait . Let 's not think of this , then , in terms of fishing . In fishing , you put a worm on a hook , fish bites the worm , takes the hook , the worm 's toast . But this is hunting country , so think of her more as a ... a salt lick . A buck comes up to the salt , boom , you shoot the buck . No harm at all to the salt lick . General , I , uh ... I think there 's been a miscommunication here . A miscommunication . Really ? Yeah . See , um , my understanding of the plan- - and I did design the plan- - an explosion is to be detonated above the craft . The effect is to bring the ship down intact . We 're not trying to , uh , bag a buck , as you so elegantly put it . We 're trying to collect specimens for the zoo . My orders are to take down their craft and to replace the craft and the bodies you people lost and , if possible , to take the occupants of the craft alive , and if not , well , we 'll have more bodies to study . This is an opportunity to communicate with beings from another world . We 're on the brink of the single most important moment in human history . As far as I 'm concerned , we 're at war . These beings have taken our citizens against their will , they 've invaded our air space , our lives , even our gene pool . These are unparalleled acts of aggression . We 're at war here , fighting an enemy we don 't understand at all , so I 'll do whatever I have to do . You guys think these things will do the job ? You men are outclassed , out equipped , and probably outnumbered . Plan A , then , would be for the missiles to do their job and take these things out of the sky . Plan B would be for you to stick your head between your legs and kiss your asses good-bye . There is no plan C , gentlemen . ( laughter ) You know about all the things they do ? The probes and stuff , man ? I hear they show you stuff that 'll rip your brain apart . I heard one of these came down in Nebraska two years ago ... took a squad and wiped them off the face of the earth . I think this is some sort of training exercise in psychological warfare , to see how we do with an impossible situation . - You saying there aren 't any aliens ? - That 's what I 'm saying . You 've all seen the S-2 briefing videos . I saw the alien autopsy video , too . Dude , that was awesome . That looked more real than any of our stuff . I met this guy once , special ops , had to debrief these two marines that were taken right through their barracks walls . Showed up a couple hours later with scars all over their bodies . They were never right again . See , it 's drug tests . Chemical warfare , something like that . We 're not fighting any aliens . We 're like lab rats being tested . You don 't think we 're gonna storm a flying saucer ? Tried to get my head around it , but , no . I think this is some very deep , weird zone of " don 't ask . " Either way , we 're toast . Ah ! Get it off ! Get it off ! Get it off ! ( all chuckle ) I 've got this thing about roaches , all right ? ( laughter ) And this is the man who 's going to save the world from the alien menace . ( laughter ) Back to work . " They judged it was him , anyway . " Said this drowned man was just his size " and was ragged and had uncommon long hair , " which was all like pap . " But they couldn 't make nothin out of the face , " because it had been in the water so long . " Weren 't much like a face at all . " They said he was floating on his back in the water . " They took him and buried him on the bank . " But I weren 't comfortable long " because I happened to think of somethin ' . " I known mighty well that a drowned man " don 't float on his back , but on his face . So I known then that this weren 't pap . " This isn 't getting too scary , is it ? It 's good . I like it . I remember I would picture that river . When I imagined it , it was all kind of dark and mossy , trees hanging down and stuff . Not like those pictures you see of Tom and Huck fishing . Oh , I 'd get so scared , but I liked it , too . And my mum would get under the covers with me and read these parts . She was nice , your mum . Yeah , she was . My mum , too . My mum 's great . You want me to go on ? Yes , please . " We played robber now and then about a month , " and I resigned . " All the boys did . " We hadn 't robbed nobody , hadn 't killed any people , " but only just pretended . " We used to hop out of the woods " and go charging down on hog drovers . " Women in carts taking garden stuff to market- - we never hogged any of ' em . " ( chuckling ) I appreciate that , Colonel . I thought with the history our families have shared over the years , you could give me an off-the-record location . Yeah , I understand what " need-to-know basis " means , you jackass . We need your help . Come in . Please , come in . Sit down . Close the curtains . You don 't have to worry . No one 's coming here . What do you mean ? I work for them , Charlie . I was the one who called them . You told them about Allie . Lisa ... Just tell me where she is . Please , Harriet , tell me where they took Allie . I don 't know . I tried to call them . All the numbers I 've been given are disconnected . I have no way of finding them . We trusted you , everyone in the group . We put our trust in you , and you betrayed it . They told me I was helping . They told me they had proof that people who had been taken were in greater danger than they knew . I thought- - You thought you were helping ? ! You told them Charlie was here , you told them Allie was with us , and now they have her ! Lisa , I am so sorry . I want you to put me back under . Allie and I , we have this link . Yes , I believe that 's real . In regression , I 've had those moments where I feel Allie , where I get that sense of knowing where she is . Yes . I 've been experiencing things like that again since they took Allie . I keep getting this sense of knowing where she is and what she 's doing . It 's very strong . I- - I want you to help me find her . We 'd have to go pretty deep . We 've gone there before , but frankly , Lisa , I 'm a little over my head here . Can you help me get there ? We 're dealing with something that I don 't fully understand . Even if I am able to access it ... hypnosis of this sort can be very dangerous . Are you sure you 're ready for that ? I 'll go wherever I have to if I can get my daughter back . You have to do this for me . You owe me that much . ALLIE : Most of the fights people have are about something simple- - you want something the other person has . or maybe they 're afraid you 're going to want it . and they go after you first . People always think that if they win . then that 's the end . everything will be all right from then on . But everything changes . and tomorrow. the thing you were fighting for will just be a memory . Like everything else . it 's already happened . They 're ready to take the shield off , doctor . What we 're going to do is extremely delicate . It would be easier for Lisa and me to find a way in if there wasn 't anyone else in the room . It 's all right . And a third deep breath ... Now I want you to go to that place where you and Allie find each other . Can you find it for me ? ( inhales deeply ) Yes . SOLDIER : " And so we would lay in ambuscade , " as he called it , " and kill the lot and scoop the things . " He said we must slick up our swords and guns and get ready . " Okay , I 'm going to take this thing off your head in just a moment . Now , it 's not very bright in here , but it may hurt your eyes at first , okay ? Okay . Okay . Now what do you see ? Darkness . All I see is darkness . I--I can make out something . LISA : There are people watching . It doesn 't feel good . There are all these people . They 're waiting for something to happen . They want something . They 're waiting for something . Do you know where you are ? It looks like a hospital ... but it 's not . It smells kind of mouldy ... it 's like an attic . DR PENZLER : Now what do you see ? Ugh ! But I don 't know if it 'll happen . There 's a lot of anger here and a lot of fear . Lisa ... Lisa . Charlie ? I don 't know if they 're gonna get what they want , but I know they 're going to keep her . They 're going to keep her until they get what they want . So what happens now ? We wait . How long should we wait ? I don 't know . You believe they 'll come ? Absolutely . But then again , I believe a lot of things . He threatens to become a major pain in the ass . NINA : If they went for Dr Penzler , they 'll be coming for you next . I don 't care about that . All I care about is finding Allie . Where is she ? I was with her in this room . It 's ... it 's a room . Uh ... Bare walls , peeling wallpaper , like a ... farm . Why a farm ? The way the room looks and ... feels . ( sighs ) Something on the wall- - license plates ... old , rusted license plates and a calendar with a picture of a tractor on it . There were all these people . A man I saw the time they tried to pick me up , but there was someone in uniform- - You said there were license plates on the wall ? Yeah , old ones . What state ? Let me think . North ... North ... North Dakota ! North Dakota ! That 's a start . North Dakota and a farmhouse doesn 't exactly narrow it down that much . Wallington 's Feed and Grain . Wallington 's Feed and Grain ! The calendar on the wall ! That was the name of the place ! North Dakota . I don 't know what city . The listing 's for Wallington 's Feed and Grain . You 're sure ? Nothing . In the whole state of North Dakota , there 's nothing . Ask yourselves , what would Maddie Hayes and David Addison do ? And they say that watching five hours of TV a day for 26 years is a bad thing . This intelligence is of an other-than-human form . They let us see what they want us to see. nothing more . Your government knows this . Gulf Breeze . Exeter . Dayton- - I love this guy . He believes in everything . The scary part is how often he comes close to the truth . ... our government has been involved in a massive conspiracy to cover this up . Call me and tell me your story . This is William Jeffries . Talk to me. and I 'll talk to you . Oh. hi . This is Theresa . from Pocatello . Idaho . and I just have to tell you . I 'm so glad you 're here . because I was abducted last September ... Snack time . I tried to talk to everybody about this . I tried the government- - I live on bad coffee and stale Oreos from the vending machine . THERESA : Thank God you 're on the air . ( telephone rings ) Yes ? Little girl 's light just came back on . North Dakota , Benson County , just outside of Brinsmade . - Program worked . - Thank you . ALLIE : My mother used to sing to me a lot . folk songs mostly . and things she liked when she was a little girl . There was this one song called Further Along that always made me feel better when I was sad . " Further along . we 'll know more about it . " Further along . we 'll understand why . " Cheer up. my brother . live in the sunshine . We 'll understand it all . by and by . " When you get to wondering too much about things . a song like that can really help a lot . When we find her , she 's gonna want that . She 'll be glad you brought it . Thanks for the book . Well , I figured now that you had that thing off , you could read it for yourself if you wanted . I was kind of hoping you would keep reading it to me . Sure . I mean , I 'd like that . Me , too . Can I ask you something ? Sure . Are they really gonna come and get you ? I don 't know . Probably something like that . That sure will be something to see . " Well , three or four months run along , " and it was well into the winter now . " I 'd been to school most of all the time " and could spell and read and write just a little " and could say the multiplication table ... # Just before it gets dark # # When the light still hangs in the sky # # The day 's not quite come # # All its promises still in your own eyes # # Between the time your mother calls # Thanks . # And the time you put the ball away # SOLDIER : " But before the cold weather , I used to slide out ... # There 's a lifetime to be lived # # And a world where every dream is here to stay # # Just before the night comes # # And you run back to the safety of your world # You 're sure you 've never heard of it- - Wallington Feed and Grain ? No , I 'm sorry . # Just before it gets time # Are you folks asking about Wallington ? Yeah . Harry Wallington , he went bust in ' 75 . '75 ? Had a place up in Brinsmade . I used to stop in on my way back from fishing with my boys . Good prices , quality products . What 's a couple of young folks doing asking about a store that went under when you were still in diapers ? Thanks . Thanks a lot . # Well , nothin ' lasts forever # # But those moments keep forever far away # You didn 't mention that it was an old calendar . Sorry , my super-vision 's a little rusty . We 're gonna find her , Lisa . We 're going to Brinsmade . Are you from there ? No . We 're visiting a sick cousin . Brinsmade 's been evacuated . You 'll find your family member at the high-school gym in Leeds . Evacuated ? Why ? Toxic spill . A truck collided with a train . What kind of spill ? They don 't tell me . They just tell me to keep the cars out . You 're not afraid you 're standing downwind of something ? You folks turn around and do like I said . You 'll find your family member in Leeds . Move along . Let 's go . # Hold on tight # # And I promise you , baby # # It 'll all be all right # # I promise you , baby # # It 'll all be all right # Okay , so where are they ? I mean , they took that thing off the little girl 's head last night , so where are they ? When I was in Afghanistan last year . This was all we did ... sit and wait . Come out and kill me already . I don 't care . Don 't make me sit here and think about what might happen . You would have been lost at the Alamo , my friend . Day one of that siege , I 'd have been the first one over that wall . So what 's the deal with the little girl , Pierce ? I mean , you been with her . She 's special . Well , what 's so special about her ? You have to be in the room with her . You guys are gonna think this is really weird- - We 're in a field waiting for a flying saucer to land . How weird could anything you tell us be ? I 've told you guys about my mum , what a good cook she was , the cookies she used to bake . We have heard the tales . My mum died in 1998 . And you start to lose ' em after they die- - your loved ones . I mean , their memories just ... start to fade in your head . I don 't mean events- - I remember birthdays , picnics , everything like that . I mean , your actual mental picture of the person . I 'm reading to Allie , just helping her pass the time . She 's just a scared little kid , and she misses her mum , just like I miss mine . The book I 'm reading , it 's something my mum used to read to me . It 's just like my mum 's there with us , that 's all I 'm trying to say . And you attribute this somehow to the little girl ? I 'm just saying , you have to be there with her . You can 't put it into words , but if you spend some time with her , you 'll get it . I can promise you that . Thank you . Sorry about how all this worked out . If you guys want to go hunting in a couple of weeks , they should have the spill cleaned up . There was no toxic spill . I can tell you that . How the hell you know that ? Because I worked that railroad 1 9 years . You know what they haul on those lines ? Lumber and steel . Nothing but lumber and steel . Now , I 'm up there at Cranberry Lake with Michael and Tony , and I 'm trying to explain a little of my philosophy of life in the woods . A couple of fellas up from Grand Forks desperate to kill something before the weekend is over , and I 'm trying to explain that that 's not really what hunting 's all about . Is this a story that goes someplace , or is this " Dewey 's Meaning of Life , Part 7 " ? The point is , the three of us are sitting around the campfire and I 'm explaining my philosophy , and this Humvee pulls up , a bunch of soldiers get out and tell us to head on back to civilization . On account of the spill . A toxic spill- - if there had been one- - they might have told us to evacuate the area and then gone on about their business . Not this bunch . They just stood there the whole time it took us to strike camp , and then they damn near followed us all the way out of the woods . Excuse me . I 'm looking for a Mr Clayton . - Over there . - That 's him ? Thanks . You 're Mr Clayton ? ( laughs ) That would be my dad . I 'm Dewey . We 'd like to hire your services . Oh , you lookin ' for a guide ? We were told that you 're the best . And you two want to go huntin ' ? In a way , yes . Well , you 're out of luck . We 're shut down . Damn government 's locked us out of our own woods . We know that . But you 've got some reason you want to go up in there , anyway ? Why don 't you step into my office ? Now what have we got out in those woods that you two are so anxious to go huntin ' for ? Our daughter . She 's lost in the woods ? No . She ... The army has her . Would this have anything to do with that toxic spill that didn 't happen ? Yeah . And your daughter , you say ? That gear back there belongs to a couple of young killers I had out this morning . I promised to ship it to ' em so they could put it in storage . I sure don 't think they 'll be back . It 'll just sit in the garage with the exercise and the cross-country skis and the racquetball rackets . Might as well put it to some use before then . It 'll get down pretty low tonight , but you get in them sleeping bags right away , you 'll survive . There 's only one farm out this way . Nobody 's lived there for 25 years , so if they 're keepin ' her anywhere around here , that 'll be the place . Now ... I take out all kinds of folks- - hunters , what have you . There 's a lot of different game up here . But if I 'm lookin ' at grouse , then I have to go in with a whole different set-up than if I 'm lookin ' at deer or elk . Now , you don 't have to be in a rush to tell me anything , but at some point , you 're gonna have to let me know just exactly what it is that I 'm gonna be lookin ' at . Oh ... just bend these and give ' em a shake . Good night . Good night . I guess we 'd better get in our bags . They 're not gonna do anything to her , Lisa . She 's too important to them . # Just before it gets dark # # Before you grow # # Before you 're too old to pretend # # Just before it gets dark # # And you know your dreams will not come back again # # Hold on # # Hold on tight # # And I promise you , baby # # It 'll all be all right # # I promise you , baby # # It 'll all be all right # ( crying ) Williams . Williams , you asleep ? Not anymore . Keel 's got the night watch on the little girl . He 's gonna let us in to take a look . You in ? Yeah . All right . Let 's go . This is really dumb . This is a court-martial . We 'll be in and out in ten minutes . - No one 's gonna get court-martialed . - Is that right ? This kid 's gonna bring these guys down from outer space . The least we can do is look her in the eye . Hi . We were just kind of wondering- - What the big deal was . Yeah , pretty much . I 'm not quite sure . I 'm important to the- - do you guys call them aliens ? Yeah , usually . Okay , the aliens . And your general figures they 'll come get me . We kind of know that already . How come you 're so special to them ? They 're my other family . What do you mean ? I 'm part them . For real ? But you just look like a little kid . Maybe they 're not as different as you think . ALLIE : Can I ask you something ? Sure . Are you mad at them ? But you 'll fight with them just the same ? That 's our job . Grownups are weird . 36 hours--nothing from Cheyenne Mountain , nothing from NORAD , nothing in the sky . Damn it ! I knew this whole thing was a bust . I 'm a four-star general . I 've been serving my country for 30 years , now I 'm sitting in the middle of Old McDonaldland with a 9-year-old girl ? I 'll tell you one thing- - I 'm gonna have that squirrelly-ass Dr Wakeman served up on a platter for this . I 'm not gonna be the only one taking this fall . You want to tell me what the hell went wrong ? Oh , you got a theory , don 't you ? They 're up in their craft worried about this girl , and as soon as you take that thing off her head , they 're gonna come swooping down . Well , we could have been mistaken . Well , that 's big of you to admit it . General , we 're talking about aliens here . By definition , their motives , their behaviour , everything about them would be ... alien . So how much longer do we wait ? That 's entirely up to you . What 's a five-letter word for " idiot " ? This whole culture is built on a fear of death . No one wants to talk about it , everyone wants to pretend it 's not gonna happen . That 's how come you get those vegetarians springing up all over the place . " lf I don 't eat the little darlings , then they 're never gonna die . " Nonsense . Neither one of you has ever been hunting , am I right ? I went out with some guys once when I was maybe 1 4 . We were living in Wisconsin . I didn 't like it . It made me feel terrible . Well , you 're supposed to feel terrible . That 's a part of it- - understanding what it costs for you to stay alive . Well , we better keep moving . As it is , it 'll be dark before we get to where I think we- - ( rustling ) That little girl of yours must be something special . - How are you ? - I 'm all right , ma 'am . What you got up there ? Some sort of toxic spill , ma 'am . Ah , is that what they told you ? Yes , ma 'am . You 'll have to let me through . I need to see General Beers . Do you have clearance ? Do you have any idea what spilled up there ? No , ma 'am , I don 't . You need to let me through . I have important information that General Beers is expecting . You 're not gonna let me through , are you ? No , ma 'am . I didn 't think so . Next time , I 'm just gonna run through the roadblock , so why don 't you arrest me ? What ? Arrest me and have someone take me to General Beers . No one goes in . We detain people here . Okay , well , then detain me and get General Beers on the phone and let him know that Mary Crawford has important new information about the project . I can 't do that without provocation , ma 'am . ( sighs ) I see . ( clears throat ) How 's this ? They 're not coming , are they ? I told you she was powerful , right ? Maybe they 're not that worried about her , maybe they think she can fight her own battles . You don 't know when to quit , do you ? At the roadblock , you told one of my soldiers you had information for me . I lied . You son of a bitch . Did you think I was just going to let you take the project away from me , you and the general here ? You bastard . You sold me out the first chance you got . Worthless bastard ! At the roadblock . Trunk . Put her somewhere where she can 't hurt anyone . MARY : Creep . It 's a woman thing , right ? They know how to hold a grudge . My father had this idea that he could do dangerous things because they needed him , that they 'd keep him safe . Well , they took care of me more than once . Because they needed us to , uh ... to get together . Because they needed Allie . Exactly . So they 're not gonna let anything happen to her . We don 't know that . They 're not gods , Charlie . No . We 're outclassed enough , so they can act like gods . We don 't know what they want with Allie or why they did this . The odds are they didn 't go through all this trouble just so they could hand her over to these people . I think she 's gonna be all right . I 'm going to find Allie and do whatever I can to help her . I 'm not going to rely on them for anything . Hey ! Okay . I need to speak to Miss Crawford . This is for Miss Crawford 's ears only . You can wait over there . SOLDIER : Yes , sir . You peeked , didn 't you ? My grandfather found it at Pine Lodge . At the crash site . I never thought your dad was all that bright . It can be very effective when a stupid person lies to you . I found some papers with these images on them when we moved out of Groom Lake . I asked your dad about them , he gave me nothing . I stood there with your father and told him I was wrong about the body from the Roswell wreckage being the transmitter . I told him there had to be something else . He just looked at me like he didn 't have a clue . ( chuckling ) You got to admire that . Mary ... I had to go with them . I couldn 't let all this happen without me . You understand ? Please . I would have done exactly the same thing . I know . So this is it , this is the transmitter , this is how they send the implant signals up . And your father had it stashed away all along . That thing 's a lot more than a transmitter . You see these engravings , these inscriptions here , whatever you want to call them ? Fascinating . You don 't know the half of it . Along this edge here , these markings are the same as the ones you saw on these rubbings from 1947 . But on this side , on this edge here , this is all new information . That was not there before . It--it gathers information ? Now we know why they left it behind . It 's been documenting this whole ... experiment . How long ago did you take off the shield ? Day and a half . Nothing 's happened ? We 've got this , which is important , and we 've got the little girl . It would be interesting to see what would happen if the two were brought together . It 'll be dark soon . I can make that happen . Excuse me ? What do you do for bathrooms around here ? We go out back . What do women do ? You go out back . I guess you 'd have to take me ? I 'll walk you there , yeah . Okay , let 's go . Whoa . What 's with the case ? It 's got my products . Products ? You never had a sister , did you ? I really do have to go . That 's it there . I can take it from here . Um , do you think I could borrow your flashlight ? I 'm kind of scared of the dark . I guess it would be okay . Thank you . " And we fished and hunted , and that 's what we lived on . " Every little while , he 'd lock me in " and went down to the store . Three miles- - " I 'm Dr Crawford . The general sent me to have a look at Allie . I wasn 't told anything about it . No , you weren 't . I 'll need you to wait outside . It 's all right . She 's not going to hurt me . I cried when Huck found out Jim never told him it was his father floating in the water . We haven 't gotten that far . I 've spoiled it for you . I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . I can 't stand knowing how something ends . It makes the whole thing seem so pointless . It 's all right . I just don 't have a lot of experience with kids . It 's really okay . I kind of guessed something like that was going to happen . You 're pretty good at that--guessing . Yeah , sort of . It must be so strange for you- - finding out how strong you are , all the things you can do . It is , a little . I frightened you a lot . I 'm--I 'm sorry . I never meant to scare you . You don 't care if you do . That 's not really true . I 'm not the kind of person who takes pleasure in frightening people , hurting them . But you do it , anyway . ( inhales deeply ) They 're not coming , are they ? I don 't know . Maybe that 's for the best . Do you want to go home ? Yes . This is something that belonged to my grandfather . Tell me what it says . Read it for me , and you can go . You can read it , can 't you ? Tell me what it says . What do you want it to say ? Don 't go little Buddha on me , honey . I don 't like it . Pick up the damn thing and read it . Pick it up ! Hah . Good as new . What happened ? Oh , my God . Well , there it is . I 'd say that now is a very good time for you to tell me what this is all about . This is gonna be a little hard to believe . Well , try me . You ever heard of the Roswell crash ? You mean that flying-saucer thing ? My father was half-alien . His father was the one survivor of that crash . Our daughter was conceived onboard an alien craft . She is of incredible importance to them . A government agency now has her . We don 't know why . She told you it was gonna be a little hard to believe . I believe every word she said . ( gasps ) What were you doing with the girl ? Just getting acquainted . Either one of them tries to leave this area again , - ( gasps ) - Shoot ' em . Is there a problem , Sol- - All units ! Target inbound ! Get ready ! SOLDIER : Let 's go ! Move out ! ( soldiers clamoring ) ( beeping ) Check out the little girl 's brain activity ! Look at this pattern ! It 's like an REM cycle kicked into overdrive ! I 've never seen anything like it ! SOLDIER : We got a sighting ! ( motor humming ) SOLDIER : Elevation--45 degrees ! SOLDIER : Get ready to fire ! ( beeping accelerating ) Allie must be in the farmhouse . We 've got to get her out ! Lisa , wait . You go running down there , and they 're gonna shoot you . I 've got to get her out of there . Lisa ! Lisa ! All batteries , report status ! Over . Alpha ready . Bravo ready . Charlie ready . All batteries , stand by ! All batteries , lock on target ! All batteries , fire on my command ! Ten , nine , eight , seven ... Sir , what about the little girl ? - Five , four ... - We 've got to get her . - At ease . - Sir ! At ease , soldier ! One . Fire ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! - Mary ! - ( screaming ) Lisa . Lisa , wait ! I can 't ! Will you two quit playing tug-o-war with each other ! You 're no good to your daughter if you 're lying down there , shot dead in some field . I know another way into that valley . Come on . Come on . ( coughs ) SOLDIER : Watch your step over here . Let 's take her . Advance to the perimeter of the craft . Use extreme caution . Mary , no ! Shoot her . Call them off ! ( gunshot ) Assault positions ! Aah ! MAN : Secondary system 's up . The little girl 's in this revved-up REM state . I 've never seen anything like it . You check for equipment malfunction ? First thing . This is her brain- - live and in person . She 's working hard at something . What do we got ? No further indication of energy from the craft since that last burst . Is it dead ? Interesting choice of words . Doctor , I need to know how much danger my men are in . What I don 't need is your mouth . If they were fixin ' to do something , they would have done it when they took Miss Crawford . - They 're done . We 're moving in . - You 'd be jeopardizing Mary- - Miss Crawford . You and I both know Miss Crawford made that choice when she ran for the craft . You never should have stopped me . I should 've gotten her . We stand a better chance of helping her if we keep going this way . We don 't know if that 's true . All I know is , that 's my daughter down there . How do I get to that farmhouse ? My daughter 's in that farmhouse . How do I get down there ? You gotta climb down the side of the mountain here . Let 's keep coming around back- - They won 't be able to see us with that thing in the ground . We should get out of here . I 'm just a hunting guide . This is way out of my league . I know it 's your kid down there , but ... We 're going . I 'm sorry . We 've got the cameras up . Good . All right , men , remember your training . Stay cool . Okay , move into positions . Men. we need to know what you see. when you see it . This is a reconnaissance . If you see anything . don 't engage unless they start it . Roger that . Approach the craft with extreme caution . Look for any indications of activity . Roger . Walker , take a team and go . Williams , Keel , Pierce , Ryan , Mack- - let 's move out . Lisa , wait . Lisa , are you okay ? Lisa . Yeah ... Yeah . Come on . Lisa ? Allie 's all right . She 's doing something very ... very hard . Sweet Jesus , that 's big . Sir. we 're 20 yards from the perimeter . The craft appears to be dead . All right. men . Proceed and look for an opening . What the hell happened ? Where 's your image ? I can 't seem to locate the problem . Nothing wrong with the equipment . Get me a picture , soldier . Come on ! Would any of you nice young people like one of my Toll House cookies ? Lieutenant ! Mum ? Command. we 're not sure exactly what we just saw . but some sort of opening has appeared in the craft . We 've got you on video . Lost you . Command. how do you hear ? Okay . Here we go . Let 's get it together . And , Walker ... stay alert , stay alive . Roger . We 're going in . Here we go , fellas . What are we supposed to do when we get there , knock on the side and say , " Open up " ? WALKER : I guess we do whatever we can . Walker . Walker ! Walker ? Lost coms . They 're flying blind . Let God be with them . Did you kids change your mind about the cookies ? What the hell is this , Pierce ? I don 't know . Maybe it 's heaven . It 's not heaven at all . It 's West Virginia . Now come in and have some cookies . This isn 't real , Pierce . None of this is real . I know . I don 't care . Walker , that 's my mum . I know she 's dead . I don 't care . I don 't care what 's real . You 'll shoot your eye out . Are you sure you don 't want a cookie ? Lieutenant ... let 's go . It feels like ... a thousand voices all talking at once . Dr Wakeman , have you noticed any fluctuations in the girl 's- - Not now . You might want to consider a more cooperative attitude . Miss Crawford came here against my express orders . You , on the other hand , were invited to assist us . Miss Crawford left you out here , doctor . She left you , and now she 's in there , jeopardizing your years of research as much as she 's jeopardizing my operation . Is that what he 's doing ? I 'm ... I 'm okay . - Be still . - ( gasps ) Ma 'am . Hold it right there . Don 't move . I see your father in you . Not enough to ruin things . Your father really should have taken a closer look at you . But he was too busy staring at his own navel to appreciate what he had . You 've done all right to get this far , Mary . You 've done fine . Here , have a cookie . They 're really good . How is this happening ? They go into your head , and they pull things out . You 've seen pictures of me . You have an idea of how you want me to be . In my day , we called them " projections , " I think now you call them " screen memories . " There are so many things I want to ask you ... But I suppose I 'd just be asking myself . Give it a try . You might find out something about yourself you never knew . I 've done things , terrible things . - You had to . - Why ? To learn about them ? To see them ? What ? Because of your overwhelming sense of their power . Because you truly know the future lies with them . Do you have another idea ? They made this girl , Allie , because they weren 't complete without us , without ... without something we could give them . Either way , their power is what compels you . I know the feeling . You want to be a part of that power at all cost . You don 't need that doctor boyfriend of yours anymore , Mary . You can 't trust him , and you know more now than he does . Trust your gut , your instincts , and you 'll be fine . Believe me . No . You 're me . You 're saying what I want you to say . I 'm saying what you know . They 're gonna win , aren 't they ? What makes you think it 's a contest ? My mother told me once that she was kind of frightened of you , that you were a scary guy . I never thought of myself as scary . I don 't see it , either . What I see is a man who couldn 't live up to his dreams . What do you mean ? You had this--all of it . You had Jacob Clarke . You had him , and you let him go . - You think I had him ? - You did . You don 't know what happened . That little boy frightened you . He frightened you so badly that you let him go . You let him go , and you spent the rest of your life running from whatever it was you saw . - It 's not that simple . - It couldn 't be simpler . You saw something that frightened you , and you ran . You 're right , I did see something . You want to know what scared me so badly ? Yes . That 's what I want to know . You want to know what I saw ? Yes , damn it , I want to know what you saw ! Then look at me , Mary . Look at me . ( screaming and sobbing ) You sure you don 't want a cookie , Mary ? Found these two in the woods , sir . My God . You know these people ? Allie 's mother and father . Put ' em somewhere where they can 't bother anybody . Take him , too . I don 't want anybody else deciding to run and play in the spaceship . Any of ' em gives you any trouble at all , shoot ' em . That 's it , let 's go . Let 's go . Lisa , talk to me , Lisa . So you 're Charlie . You don 't use the last name " Keys , " do you ? There was a time when a great deal of money and technology went into looking for you . Kind of a boost to the old ego , wouldn 't you say ? If we have time when this is over , I 'd like a moment to knock you on your ass . Oh , yes--a fighter . No-nonsense . That 's what they always liked about the Keys family- - you guys had ' tude . Your fight 's not with me anymore , Chuck . The soldier boys took over . It 's a whole new ball game now . Lisa , are you all right ? All these voices ... more and more . It 's too hard ... just a little longer ... You still think this is all some kind of weird experiment ? I think you ought to ask me later is what I think , sir . ( gasps ) Get ' em off ! Get ' em off ! Get ' em off me ! Walker ! Walker ! They 're not real ! They 're in your head ! They 're in your head ! Okay , yeah . Did I also tell you guys that I 'm really , really scared of rabid dogs and cobras ? Joke . It was a joke . Let 's move out . Alle ihre erinnerungen und alle ihre angste . Miss Crawford- - How do we know it 's really her ? Alle ihre erinnerungen und alle ihre angste . All your memories and all your fears . ( guns firing ) WALKER : Come in , Colonel ! Come in ! - SOLDIER : Anybody copy ? - We 're here . Say again . They 're everywhere ! Lieutenant Williams , get your people out of there ! Look at that . Walker , withdraw from the objective . Pull back now . Williams , do you copy ? WALKER : Does anybody copy ? They 're coming out of the walls. sir . ( panting heavily ) Keel ! Pierce ! Any stations . Do you copy ? MAN : What 's that ? ( rumbling ) Oh , my God . MAN : Hold steady , guys . Come on , come on . Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! ( yelling orders ) SOLDIER : What do we do , sir ? Lisa . Lisa . Lisa . Lisa . I guess they got what they came for . That little girl is gone . ALLIE : When I was very little . my mother would read nursery rhymes to me . I always hated Humpty Dumpty . That 's a very scary poem . No one knows how to put it back together again- - not all the king 's horses or all the king 's men . No one wants to think that there 's anything in the world that could fall apart that badly . but. of course ... anything can . I guess that 's what 's so scary about Humpty Dumpty . Move the troops and weapons out of here quick . I don 't want to be here when and if the media comes to see about this so-called toxic spill . We 'll debrief at Fort Ash . And , Colonel ... we were never here . Bring the mother and father , too . We 're gonna need to talk to them . They 're our only link to the girl . We don 't have a prayer in hell , do we ? Just get it all done ASAP . Sir , I found this in the back of the Humvee that Miss Crawford was in . You want to tell me what this is ? It 's theirs . No kidding . Get me Wakeman . Peters , send in Wakeman . You showed this to the little girl , didn 't you ? Damn it . Mary , you all right ? What happened ? What did you see ? What can you tell me about this , doctor ? Nice ... very nice . What is it ? Ahem ... it gathers information , responds to stimuli . It could be a recording device ... could be a brain . Just keep it up , doctor . You and Miss Crawford withheld valuable information . In my opinion , your actions and those of Miss Crawford are directly responsible for the failure of this mission . Nice to have someone to blame when things go wrong , huh ? Put ' em in the truck with the others and take ' em back to Fort Ash ! Maybe the ride will give ' em a little time to consider the consequences of being uncooperative . - Let 's go . - Ma 'am . I want two guards on them at all times . Where are we being taken ? She needs medical attention . I don 't need anything . Charlie , it 's gonna be all right . These two are coming with me . Lieutenant , I would like you to join us . What , you 're not even gonna try and find Allie ? They just take her away , and that 's that ? What would you suggest ? I don 't know . Just come with me , Charlie . It 's gonna be all right . You drive . I ride in the back with the mother . Can you tell me about it ? I don 't want to talk about it , Chet , I really don 't . I 'm sorry about the artifact . I was guarded . I couldn 't get to it . It 's not important anymore . How can you say that ? You saw it . It was working overtime . Something is still going on . When you went into that ship , what did you see ? Bugs . Cockroaches . Something you 're afraid of ? It 's been a thing with me ever since I was a kid . And the other soldier ? Pierce . He saw his mother . We all did . Turn around . Turn around ! Stop the truck and get the general on the radio . You 'll have to sit down . I don 't have to do anything . What you have to do is turn this truck around , unless you want to tell the general you refused to go back and get the girl . Stop the truck . Stop the truck ! Get on the radio and see if you can get the general . Honk your horn . Maybe he 'll see us . ( honk honk ) General Beers , do you copy ? Why are we stopping ? Where the hell 's the mother and father ? They 're with you , sir . What ? They were with you , sir . I can explain this to you , but you 're not gonna like it . They put the farmhouse back . They never took it away . See if the little girl is inside . ( soldiers shout orders ) What 's the meaning of this ? Do you see it ? There was nothing . No craft , no aliens--nothing . Everything we saw and just went through , it all came out of our heads . She took it . Allie took it . Our wishes , our dreams , our fears ... our memories . Then she played them all back . Is that possible , doctor ? You ever played tick-tack-toe with a chicken ? It 's something you do at county fairs . You see , when you pick a square , it releases feed into the spot where the chicken should go next . What you see from out there with all the suckers is a game of tick-tack-toe . But what the chicken sees from inside the game is a very different level of reality . So none of this really happened ? This little girl can manifest thought . That 's as simply as I know how to put it . Then find a way to put it more simply . She fooled us , General . Pure and simple . The house is clear . I 'm gonna check the perimeter . You with me . Check the back . Then where is she ? This is the part you 're definitely not gonna like . Sir , where am I going ? Where we 're going is back to find our daughter . Now get out ! Get out ! You don 't have to go anywhere . I don 't know what you did , honey , but you sure did it . Hey ... hey . Hey , honey . They wanted to use me to make the ship come down . I know . I thought if I could make them think that I 'd gone- - that I had been taken- - they would stop looking for me and everything could just go back to the way it was . It 's all right . It 's gonna be all right . But they were gonna take you away . Don 't . You did great . They 're gonna figure it out . And they 're gonna come looking for me again . Just ' cause they 're looking doesn 't mean they 'll find you . Charlie 's right . We are not gonna let them get you again . I 'm scared . Sweetheart ... I just wanted to say ... I don 't know what happened back there and I don 't think I ever will , but seeing my mum again- - what you did for me was a pure kindness , and I 'll always thank you for it . Soldiers coming . Allie , can you help us ? Nothing 's happening . She 's exhausted . Come here . I 'm sorry about hitting you . You really care about Allie , don 't you ? Yeah . She needs your help . Took off over those hills about ten minutes ago . SOLDIER : Load up ! Okay , just to recap- - we got a giant craft- - a mother ship , if you will- - that everyone saw but wasn 't really there at all because she made it all up . And then , while we 're standing around with our thumbs up our collective asses , she waltzes up looking just like me and takes off with her parents . That about sum it up ? Perimeter sealed ? Soldiers at every access . We 'll find ' em . If you do find them , General , then what will you do ? When Allie did what she did , when she manifested the ship and everything in it , she demonstrated a power far beyond anything the aliens themselves are capable of . So what , do we pack up our tents and go home ? I see it more as , uh ... sit back and enjoy the show . What happened , soldier ? They overpowered me , sir . They overpowered me and got away . Wonderful . Allie ? Thought them soldiers would never leave . I 've been up there watching you guys for a couple hours . You just gonna stand there waiting for me to apologize , or are you gonna get in the damn truck ? What did they do to that poor little girl ? ALLIE : I had done what I could . I tried to make the soldiers think that their plan to use me as bait hadn 't worked . that I had been taken away . I thought that if I could make them believe that I was gone. then they wouldn 't bother me anymore . and I could go back to who I used to be . But too much had happened to all of us by then for anything to go back to how it was . Well , this is as far as I go . Just leave me here and keep on going . You might need all them rich-boy tents and stuff in back . Thank you . Have you got a car around here ? In the parking lot of the bar . You better give me the keys . I 'll put it somewhere where they won 't find it right away . There 's something I gotta say here . I saw something that I never thought I 'd see . And as for me running out on you up there , l- - No . - You take care of your little girl . - Thanks . I hope this ends well for you . Thank you . Now go on . Get out of here . Okay . That 's everything , right ? Hey . Hello . How ya doin ' ? I 'm all right . You helped her escape , didn 't you ? No ... I didn 't . I know you did . I can either tell the colonel , or you and I can talk . They overpowered me . Sure they did . She told me you could be trusted- - Allie--when I was with her . She told me if things got out of hand , that you were a good guy , and you 'd been nice to her . I don 't understand . You 've noticed I 'm not exactly on good terms with your general . I was opposed to this entire operation- - taking a little girl and using her as bait . It 's sick . It 's all right . Like I said , she told me you were a good guy . I 'm not asking just to know . I 'm worried about her . Worried ? If you had to help her , that means she couldn 't help herself . Do you mean , like , look like someone who wasn 't there ? For example . If she 's weak or sick , she may need my help . She tried to do something , but she couldn 't . So she 's weak . Is she gonna be all right ? I 'm sure she 'll be just fine . - WOMAN : Here you go , come on . - ( dog barks ) - BOY : Got it , Dad . - Brought your favourite right here . How 's she doing ? She 's asleep . My father had some of what Allie has . My Uncle Tom--he said that using his abilities made my dad weak . That 's what killed him . She 's not your father . She 's got other things in her . Your blood ? Yeah , and your mum 's . Lisa , there 's a reason this all leads up to her . Maybe she can handle it . We don 't know that . What if she never gets better ? What if she just burned herself out and this is all that 's left ? Then we 'll get her some help . Who are we gonna get to help her ? The first thing is to get off the road , get someplace safe . My uncle and I have a plan . If things get bad enough , I put an ad in the personals of the New York Times- - " Drummer seeks gig in country-western band . " Then Tom gets a message to me about where to meet him . How does he do that ? Talk radio . A guy named William Jeffries has a late-night talk show about aliens , government conspiracies- - Crazy stuff . Right . And my uncle , having written these books about aliens and government conspiracies ... Jeffries is always glad to take his call . Then we 'll place an ad . I got it . Thanks . Nothing . Not on the little girl or her mother ? No signal ? What does that mean ? I 'd say it means that Allie was the point of all this , and now that she 's demonstrated , they don 't care about anyone else . - I want her back . - You don 't have the means . Find her for me . Are you asking me back into the fold , General ? Would you like for us to work together again ? This little girl is the product of three generations of selective breeding , of a genetic experiment on an unparalleled scale . Once they produced her , they sat back for nine more years . I would suggest to you that they were waiting for a moment when all that was latent in her would become active . When she did what she did here- - made us see the craft- - that was her " demonstrating " ? They saw the power they 'd been waiting to see . This little girl- - this extremely powerful little girl- - I don 't need to point out how important she is to us . There 's a big leap from looking at the sun to making a hydrogen bomb . In between , you just go blind . I 'm gonna find that little girl , with or without your help . And when you find her , then what ? When this started , you asked us just how powerful she was . She did this , she did all this , General , and I believe she 's just getting started . In a war , Miss Crawford , you don 't run away just because the enemy has superior firepower . Do you really still see this as a war ? I told you that before , yes . It 's between us and them . I can help you win it . I can help you find the girl . Mary- - Your soldier Pierce helped her get away . He helped her because she was too weak to help herself . She 's weak now . You can pick her up . But when she gets strong again , she 'll be unstoppable . You 're thinking , " l can get to the girl . Why do I need this bitch in the mix ? " I don 't use the expression " in the mix . " When I showed her the artifact- - that thing my grandfather found at Roswell- - she saw something that frightened her deeply . I know what she saw . Do you ? I know because I saw it , too , and it frightened me . It 's what my grandfather saw . And you 're not sharing ? I agree that this is a war , and we 're fighting an enemy we can 't possibly defeat , not with any of the means at our disposal . But that little girl is much more powerful than they are . Here 's the kicker- - I know how to talk her into working for us . What are you doing ? I told him what he wanted to hear . It sounded pretty real to me . We 'll give them just enough truth to hang themselves . You 'll help him use Allie to stop them ? That 's what I told him , yes . I think that 's what you want now , too . That 's not what I want at all . What scared you ? What did you see ? It 's like a walk through a mine field , isn 't it ? - What is ? - Life . When you start out , there 's just a few mines- - childhood diseases , falls from high places- - then you hit adolescence , and there 's more mines- - drugs , unprotected sex , drunk drivers , lonely kids with guns- - and the older you get , the more mines you see , and all you 're trying to do is get to the other side of the field , but that 's not possible , is it ? No , because the more you look , the more mines you see . Pretty soon , you realize that there 's nowhere left to step . Mary ... what did you see ? What did I see ? I saw where all the mines were . I saw everything I 'd ever done , everything that had ever happened to me . I saw where all this would end . That 's what Owen saw . That 's what destroyed him . I 'm not folding like my grandfather did . Did what I see frighten me ? Of course it did . Will it stop me ? No . Everybody dies . Don 't worry about the general , sweetheart . We 'll keep him around for as long as we have to . Once we have Allie on our side , he doesn 't stand a chance . What 's Allie scared of ? You said you thought the artifact was gathering information . Well , say that 's their record of this whole experiment , everything they 've done and intend to do here . You 'll agree that Allie is the end result of that . - She 's what this is all about ? - Of course . I think she saw her own destiny . I think she saw what they want her to do , and I don 't think she likes it . ( cheering ) Happy birthday , Allie ! Allie , happy birthday . Yee-haw . We 're so glad to have you back , Allie . We never want you to go away again . ( cheering continues ) Look at all the presents ! Look at all of your friends ! This is where you belong . This is where you should stay . We can all be one happy family . ALL : Stay with us , Allie . ( all talk at once ) I can 't ! I can 't . ( breathing heavily ) ( truck door closes ) You 're not going to come inside ? If somebody comes , what are you gonna do ? I don 't know . I want to keep watch . They had no right to do any of this . No . Our lives don 't belong to them , Lisa . There 's gotta be a way to stop this . You 're a good guy . I 'm glad you 're with us . Mum . Honey , you feeling better ? Can I talk to you for a minute ? Yeah . This is all getting pretty scary , huh ? When those people took me- - the ones that thought they could trick the spaceship into coming down- - Yeah . Do you remember that woman ? You know , the one that I went with at Dr Penzler 's ? Right . She said that her family and our family had known each other for a long time , that her grandfather knew your grandma . She had this thing that her grandfather had found when the spaceship crashed a long time ago . What sort of thing ? It was a piece of some sort of metal . It was more than that , though . It was part of them . I could feel in her head that it was important , that she had done a lot of things to get it . She asked me to read it to her . Could you ? No ... but I felt like I understood it . It made me feel like I was with all of them . Does that make sense ? If you felt it , then , yes , it does . She asked me to touch it , but I didn 't . Why not ? When I looked at it , I saw things . What ... kind of things ? ( softly ) Things that are going to happen . Mummy ... Yeah ? I just want to stay here with you . You are gonna stay here with me , okay ? - I won 't be long . - Okay . An army spokesperson said that the little girl and her parents had inadvertently wandered into an area under quarantine after a toxic spill . What about that little girl ? Whoever heard something like that ? Army chasing after a kid ? The little girl may have come in contact with something that is extremely dangerous . Sounds like some sort of secret biological hoodoo . One of those , like , flesh-eating viruses where you bleed out your eyeballs . The Bush Administration has issued a statement flatly denying the growing rumours of some sort of biological weapons test . What did I just say ? Flesh-eating virus . ... you 're urged to contact the FBI or your nearest army barracks with details . There is a substantial reward for any information leading to her whereabouts . Tell me how substantial that reward is , maybe I 'll forget about the extremely dangerous- - Dude , your change ! What the heck crawled up his butt ? ... driving a silver GMC Sierra . Again. if you have any information on the girl or her parents- - First thing we gotta do is get rid of this truck . We 'll take backroads , we won 't camp at sites . My mum and I moved around a lot , so I 've got experience with this kind of thing . Well , it seems to have stopped thinking for the moment . I know it shut down . What I want to know is , why ? Your grandfather tried to have it translated , right ? My father , too . Any luck ? You really should have told me about this earlier . Trust is the basis for all healthy relationships . I didn 't think we knew each other well enough . You two can work on your relationship on your own time . What can I tell you ? I take my work home with me . The artifact never came on when either your father or grandfather had it , right ? My father certainly never mentioned it . We 're gonna translate it . We 're gonna learn how to speak alien . The best way to crack any code is to know what they 're trying to say . This thing came on to record Allie 's demonstration of power . So then everything that happened in North Dakota should be on there right now . Or a recipe for chicken a la grey . I think we can do this and make this work . We 're gonna need a team of linguists , cryptologists- - Mathematicians ? The Fibonacci Sequence again . I 'm glad you find it so promising . Why don 't see if it starts off by telling me where I can find the little girl ? The place is deserted . You 'll be safe here . Okay . You should probably give me all the money . Right . All we got . Charlie ... Be safe , okay ? We need you . Well , I could maybe give you that Datsun over there . Does it run ? On a wing and a prayer . You figure I 'm asking a lot , wanting you to take a truck with no papers ... Yeah , I do . Even though it 's fully tricked-out , less than 20,000 miles on it ? All the more reason to be dubious , my friend . I need something reliable . And I need a vehicle I don 't have to strip into parts to see a profit . You and I both know that , stripped down to parts , this truck will get you at least $ 1 5,000 . I have a feeling you couldn 't stand to watch a profit like that drive away . Why don 't I just turn you in ? Then the cops take the truck . Look , the only way this works out for you is if you cut a deal with me . All right . You look around and tell me what will meet your needs . I 'll go juggle some numbers , see what I can do . ( radio plays ) Hi there . Oh , uh ... just coffee . You sure you don 't want anything else ? Our early bird hasn 't killed too many people this week . Coffee 's fine . Let me get this mess for you . Oh , man . I 'm so sorry . No . Here , let me- - Forget it ! Forget it ! Let me help . No . I gotta go wash this crap off . Let me help you . I think you 've done enough . Lousy cup of coffee , and you 're this much work ? You could 've ordered something . Getting hungry ? Yeah . Charlie should be back with some real food soon . He 's been gone a long time . I know . Here . Feeling better ? I 'm okay . Don 't , uh ... Don 't do anything for a while , even if people come for us , okay ? I don 't think I can yet . Well , don 't try . I thought you might want to have ... this . I knew I 'd find you . I knew I 'd be able to bring it to you . You 're gonna have a hell of a lot to write about . Yeah . " Yeah " ? That 's all you got from me ? Yeah ... Yeah . Probably just Charlie . Do you know how to use that ? Not a clue . But if I point it at someone , they 're not gonna know that . You stay here . I 'll go see who they are and what they want . And , baby ... don 't do anything . I can take care of this . Hello , Allie . Allie ? Allie ? Get away from my daughter right now ! Hello , Lisa . Please , don 't be frightened . I 'm your grandfather . Your grandmother gave this to me a long time ago . ( truck approaching ) ( radio playing ) ( men yelling ) Whoo ! Yeah ! We know you 've got that little girl in there ! Come on out ! Dude , turn that up . Maybe they can 't hear us . Stay here . Let me take care of this . THUG : Get out here . Want us to come in there and get you ? Come on out . Got a little surprise for you . Come on out before we come in ! Yeah . We 've come about the little girl . There 's no little girl here . It 's just me . You 're lying . We followed you up from Halsey . We saw the guy take off in his truck . You and your friends should go away . There 's nothing here for you but trouble . This trouble supposed to be coming from you , huh ? Bang . Who the hell are you ? Huh ? Who the hell are you ? What the hell are you doing ? Make him stop . Shoot him ! Shoot him , somebody ! Shoot him ! Shoot him ! Shoot him ! Shoot him ! Somebody shoot him ! Allie ? Go away ! Go away now ! Allie , what are you doing ? Stop it , please ! Stop it . Get out of here ! ( all yelling at once ) ( tyres squeal ) What the hell is going on ? These guys came for Allie . She scared them off . CHARLIE : Who 's that ? Allie 's ... great-grandfather . You mean he 's- - They shot him . Good . He was trying to help . Help ? He 's the one who 's responsible for this whole thing . We wouldn 't need his help if he hadn 't started this . What do you want , huh ? What the hell do you want ? ! Charlie , stop it ! Let 's go . People are gonna come looking for this truck . What about him ? Leave him . Leave him and let 's go . We can 't just leave him here . Sweetheart , he 's not our friend . That doesn 't matter . It 's not the right thing to do . Can 't just leave him . No , sir , I don 't have another explanation . We didn 't get information about the vehicle until this morning . Thankfully , there 's been no media circus yet . Yes , I appreciate that fact , sir . Thank you , sir . " You can 't get re-elected if people perceive you as beatable . " Put that in the quote book right next to " Ask not what your country can do for you . " We got enough to do out in the field without having to cover junior 's ass . Okay , beautiful . Thanks . What do you think happened here ? I think it 's safe to say her strength is returning . You love me ... right ? What is this , Chet ? Remember I said that we didn 't have a signal on Allie , that we didn 't know where she was ? I lied . Yes , Chet . I love you . ALLIE : There 's a feeling you get sometimes in a bad dream . You 're running. and something dark and big is chasing you . and you want to just stop to let the dark. big thing catch up with you . Something bad is going to happen . you can ' t change that . but you can turn and see it coming . You can see the face of your bad dream . - MAN : Doctor ! - Please . We 've got to get away from all these people . - They 're with somebody . - With somebody ? Another man . According to these gentlemen , a man stepped forward . A guy in his 30s . His eyes turned black , and they shot him . They were waiting for her to demonstrate . They see she 's got the power , and bam ! They 're here . You 're saying the one who did all this was an alien ? You are paying attention . She didn 't leave in a spaceship . She left in a Dodge Durango . Still doesn 't make you look very good , does it ? You take a nine-year-old girl and a special ops unit into the American heartland , you lose the girl , you come up with nothing . - You 're in the deep end . - You 're right in there with me . I have to go back to Washington and explain what happened here . Find me the girl and whoever she 's with . - How 'd you like us to do that ? - The little girl 's weak . This being who came to help her has been shot . You 'll have a definite advantage . - Smooth sailing , I 'd say . - Just do it . And when we find her ? Then find me . I 'll take it from there . WAKEMAN : That 's worked so well up till now . I 'm not goin ' down alone on this one . Try not to screw things up . They 're about ten hours ahead of us in Montana . I had our guy switch the monitoring to my laptop in case the general got it into his head to check . Good . Mary , you 've been through a lot with your father and everything with Allie . I just wanted you to know I 'm here for you . I know that . You said you thought they were waiting for her to demonstrate . Yeah . What happens now that she has ? Pie . - What ? - Pie . My rule of any car trip . Let 's find a place to get some . I 'll tell you my theory of everything . JOHN : She 's exhausted from all that she 's been doing . - She 'll be all right . - Will she ? And then what ? They come for her again or she does something again . You 've gotta do something to change all this . I just want my little girl back . You started all this , and you don 't have any more of an idea where it 's gonna end than any of us do . Charlie ? What 's going on ? Get out . Get out ! LISA : What are you doing ? Just give me a minute . I want to talk to you . LISA : We need his help . Allie does . His help ? He 's the one responsible ! I want to know what the hell this is all about . Charlie , you 're hurting him . Stop it . He 's already weak . Sweetheart , it 's gonna be all right . Give me a minute . Why are you here ? Why have you been doing this ? What the hell do you want ? - We 're just trying to understand . - Understand what ? Everything . JOHN : I 'll try to put this in terms that you commonly use . I 'm ... a scientist . We were all scientists . We came here to learn about your world . Our idea was to find out everything- - your history , your biology ... everything . We came here to learn . We 're not that different from you genetically , biologically , but what you call evolution has changed us . We see things in you that ... we no longer recognize in ourselves . WAKEMAN : What do we know ? They 're this energy that can manifest itself in different ways- - as the beings we 've seen , as their crafts , as our thoughts . There 's no right or wrong about them . JOHN : The whole concept of right and wrong was ... alien to us . The idea that the things we were doing were cruel ... WAKEMAN : They have no concept of kindness or cruelty , no way of seeing beyond the oneness of all that energy ... JOHN : ... to the separateness , the uniqueness , your ability to hate , to love , to feel . You have compassion as well as cruelty . We lack both . Or that is , the traits lie dormant ... WAKEMAN : ... in their brains , like the animal that lives far back inside all of us . But an experience of something basic can awaken that primitive thing . JOHN : And that 's what happened . Your grandmother Sally , she took me in and showed me a great kindness . MARY : Something could have touched one of them , something simple , awakened the sense of what was missing , something gone and half-remembered . And so our greatest experiment began . Could they put it back , this thing that had been bred out of them for eons and eons ? JOHN : Your emotional core- - your strength , your feeling- - and our more-evolved consciousness ... could we bring these two together ? If we could do this , we would have the next ... MARY : ... step in the evolution of life . The experiment was an unqualified success . What do you think is gonna happen next ? Allie goes with us . We work with her . We help her to understand our part of the equation . That 's never gonna happen . You still don 't get it . This ... thing you saw in my grandmother , this compassion , our humanity- - you still don 't have a clue what that means . Allie is my daughter . She is nine years old . I love her with all my heart and soul . You will never take her away from me . She can 't stay here , Lisa . She did too much . If she uses her power again , that part of her that 's us , it will kill her . You were right . Those people will keep coming after her , and she will do something to keep you or Charlie safe . It 's the only place for her . That is what 's next . No , it isn 't . You 've inflicted enough pain on this planet . It 's over . Let it go . Go away . Montana . Looks like they 've stopped . We should be able to catch up with them tonight . Tomorrow morning at the latest . We 've taken it all the way together , haven 't we ? I don 't know what you mean . We 're gonna be there when it comes together . We 're gonna know we did our part . Our part ? Keep Allie safe , so they can finish their work . You 're fine with that , aren 't you ? Them finishing their work . I can 't wait . That 's all you want , right ? Front seat at the show ? They 're more highly evolved than we are . She 's more highly evolved than they are . It 's the way of the Tao . Nature takes its course . What if it 's our nature to fight back ? Then we lose . Evolution 101 . Pretty weird couple of days . Yeah , pretty weird . You all right ? I just want to be home listening to my CDs playing soccer with my friends . I know . I 'm just a little kid . I didn 't ask anyone to make me special . WOMAN ON RADIO : My friend Dale . his son was killed in the Gulf War . Allie showed him his boy . We all saw him clear as day ... Your uncle should have seen the ad we put in the paper by now . He will . He 'll call . RADIO HOST : What else happened . Cynthia ? CYNTHIA : People were there from the government . people who 'd come to take her . HOST : I want to hear the rest of this . but right now we 've got a call I 've been hoping for . I 'm gonna ask you to please stay on hold a few minutes . As he does from time to time . noted UFO-logiest Tom Clarke is checking in . - Talk to me . Tom . - TOM : Hi . Bill . HOST : Tom Clarke . What news from the front. my friend ? TOM : I 've got nothing tonight but a false alarm . I 'm calling from Gray 's Lake in Idaho . HOST : Gray 's Lake . Promising name . Uncle Tom ! Uncle Tom ! Hey , there , sweetie . Hey . - It 's good to see you . - Good to see you , too . Is this him ? - He 's my dad . - I know . - Tom . - Charlie . Thanks for taking such good care of our family . What kind of adventures you been on lately ? - A lot 's been goin ' on . - Oh , yeah ? Tom ? It 's good to see you . I thought we 'd go into Mexico through Texas . I got a guy down in El Paso . He 's working on the documents . He 's gonna meet us at my mum 's old place in Lubbock . I was thinking that you guys should go down to South America . I 've got a family there who can put you up indefinitely in Buenos Aires . It 's a big change , but I just think it 's something you have to do . What ? You 've got a feeling ? This is all supposed to be going somewhere , that 's all . Mexico sounds like a good idea . What do we do about him ? He doesn 't look too good . I don 't think we 'll have to worry about him much longer . ALLIE : People talk a lot as if the most important thing in life is to always see things for what they really are . But everything we do . every plan we make is kind of a lie . We 're closing our eyes and pretending the day won ' t ever come when we won ' t need to make any more plans . Hope is the biggest lie there is . and it is the best . You have to keep going as if it all mattered . or else we wouldn 't keep going at all . ( country western music on radio ) Want a granola bar ? Are they good ? They 're not as healthy as they say on the wrapper . They 've got a lot of sugar in them . You eat food , don 't you ? - We eat . - Try it . That 's good . I don 't want to do this . I know . At the gas station , I was gonna make those men hurt each other . I could have done that . - But you didn 't . - I almost did . I don 't want to hurt people . How do I make this stop ? I mean , if I couldn 't do any of those things , then people would leave me alone , wouldn 't they ? I don 't know that much about people . - Is there anything I can do ? - Nothing . Will the others come for you ? I 'm not important . Allie , things are gonna get hard for you for a while . You 'll be afraid , and you 'll be alone . You 're becoming more than you already are . I 'm not going to go with you . I belong here with my family . I brought this for you . What is it ? It was your great-grandmother 's . She gave it to me before I left . I can 't do this much longer . I know . - How you feelin ' ? - Okay . You always wanted to go on a long car trip , didn 't you ? ( laughs ) Allie ... John ... he 's helped us out , and he 's hurt , but that doesn 't mean you have to do anything he asks . I already told him I wasn 't going to go with him . What did he say ? He gave me this . Let me have that . My dad , he used to say that kids shouldn 't ever have to think about anything more complicated than baseball . You 're gonna be a little girl again ... I promise . Hey , back together again . See how this looks , gorgeous . I 'm never gonna let you go , honey . Never . MARY : Oh , that 's lovely . I 've got a gun to your mother 's back . I 'm betting I can get a shot into her before you turn the gas station into a flying saucer or a house of pies . Allie , don 't try to do anything . Do you understand ? Be a good girl . Listen to your mum . Allie , when we were in that farmhouse , you saw something that scared you . I think you know what they want you to do , and I don 't think you want to do it . I can take care of you . I can keep you safe from your ... friends . We can work together on this . I don 't want to hurt anybody . I really don 't . You 're out of options . You must have realized that by now . I have the resources and technology to help you . It 's me or them . I just want to help . You 're lying . You can 't help anyone . Let 's go . Get in the car ... now ! Get in ! Move ! Move ! CHARLIE : Lisa ! Allie ! Hey ! Hey ! ( horn honks ) WAKEMAN : Hold on ! - Allie , don 't do anything . It 's not safe ! - I didn 't do anything ! ( whimpering ) Come on ! ( gunshot ) - Stop it ! - You were gonna shoot her ! You 're damn right . She 's staying here with us ! That was too close . How did they find us ? CHARLIE : Sweetheart , I want to ask you something . Those people from the government- - when you went with them , you said they put something over your head . Right . I heard them say it was to block a signal . If those people know enough to block that signal , then they know how to read it , to track it . You have one , too , Lisa . That 's how they found you in Seattle . There 's not much point in going to Buenos Aires , is there ? No matter where we go , they 'd find us . TOM : There 's gotta be something we can do . You can shut her off , can 't you ? You can do something so they won 't be able to track her signal or mine . If you can do it , then do it . You owe us that much . I can 't do it . I don 't have the strength . But Allie can . Find it inside you , Allie . Can you ? LISA : Allie , don 't do anything . You 're weak . ALLIE : I have to . Allie , please , no . ( big band music playing ) ( turns music off ) What are you doing ? The music helps me concentrate . We 're not picking up their signals . I know . You know ? Shut off . Gone . No more signals . - You didn 't bother to tell me ? - I was gettin ' to it . - Do you think Allie did it ? - Probably . - You seem pleased about it . - Check this out . The sightings are starting again . Lights in the sky . Idaho and Nebraska . We better be ready . You can 't do anything , Mary . Don 't you get it ? You want to talk about what happened at the parking lot ? - You were gonna shoot her . - I was going to stop her . That 's not up to you . You 're not gonna let it go , are you ? I can 't . Do you know the story of the Medusa ? You look at her and you turn to stone . Unless you know the secret which you have to be an enlightened warrior to learn . This is going somewhere , right ? If you know the secret ... you can kill her . And then the winged horse , Pegasus , flies from her head and the world becomes a very ... very beautiful place . I used to think we could get something out of this . A new science ... something . I even thought we could get the better of them somehow . But we 're not ready to be anything but spectators in this . Anything more stone . I 'm not giving up , Chet . I 'm gonna find her , and I 'm gonna be more than just a witness to this . MAN ON RADIO : If it 's really all about the little girl Allie like all your callers are saying . then maybe this isn 't some evil conspiracy after all . Mr Jeffries . Maybe this is all about coming together and moving on . JEFFRIES : Thank you . Bruce from Nebraska . End on a good note . I always say . Are these the last days ? Is it all coming to a head ? The lights are in the sky. and a little girl is out there somewhere on the road . She 's in our thoughts . and she has our prayers . This is William Jeffries saying . " Keep watching the skies and hope for an answer that doesn 't hurt . " LISA : I should 've stopped her . I never should 've let her shut us off . All right , all right . Take a breath . Take a breath . Let her come out of it a little before she travels again . Nobody 's gonna find you here . - What about John ? - Let him rest . Give Allie a couple of days until she 's stronger . My friend will be here by then with the papers , and we can move on . What are you doing ? I can 't stay with you anymore . If I 'm here , sooner or later you 'll be found . Now that you 've turned your signals off once I 'm gone ... none of us will know where you are . You mean no one will be able to find me ? I can 't promise you that . Then at least you 'll get the chance to be the little girl you said you wanted to be . But if things get too difficult if you feel that you can 't stay here any longer , you can find us again . You 'll know . Find the part of you that is us . We 'll hear you , and we 'll come for you . But unless you call us ... we won 't be able to find you . I 'm the one that 's gonna know ? When the time comes ... it 'll be your choice . What I 've learned from doing this what 's changed in me I would never , never do any of this again . This is all my fault . It wasn 't mine to meddle . You wouldn 't have been able to do it if you weren 't supposed to . I 'm very glad I got to see you . Good-bye , Allie . Can I walk with you a minute ? Just to the edge of the woods . This is as far as you should go . Good-bye , Allie . ALLIE : How do you let someone go ? How do you understand that that 's all right . that everything changes ? How do you find a way for that to make you feel good about life instead of breaking your heart ? The hardest thing you 'll ever learn is how to say good-bye . LISA : Allie ? Allie ? Allie ... Allie . Charlie ? Charlie ! What did he do to her ? He did something and just left ! No , I don 't think so . I think she was about to give out anyway . I think he left to protect her ! I had this feeling about John , something he was feeling . When John showed Allie how to block our signals , I think he made it so the aliens couldn 't find us , either . But as long as he stayed with us , sooner or later they were gonna find us . He was part of them ... I don 't know . But I think when he went back , he was giving Allie , giving us all a chance . So we should take it . Maybe they don 't know where she is , either . - That 's a thought , isn 't it ? - You can 't be serious . What if they 're lookin ' for her , too ? Her signal disappeared and then her mother 's . And then the lights appeared . How 's that possible ? She 's with one of them . Good question . So what do you think ? The man driving the camper was Tom Clarke , Lisa 's uncle . Yeah , I thought I recognized him . He 's gettin ' a little long in the tooth . I had the office upload my grandfather 's files , everything we have on Tom Clarke . My--my grandfather went to Texas once . Yeah , and got the be Jesus scared out of him by Jacob Clarke , right ? Tom still owns his mother 's farmhouse , the one my grandfather went to get Jacob . - You think that 's where they 've gone ? - I 'm all for takin ' a look . What if they 're there , Mary ? Then what ? ( big band music playing ) ( turns up volume ) Austin , Texas . Tom Clarke . This is Tom Clarke . I 'm not home right now . but if you 'd like to leave a message . just leave it at the tone . Tom Clarke , this is Chet Wakeman . I 'm calling you with a warning . I want to help you . ( gunshot ) ( whimpering ) You know , I never would have thought , 50-odd years ago , when we found him in the shed it was all leading towards something like this . They took you , right ? They did . And you stood up to them , didn 't you ? I tried . You stood by Allie and Lisa . This goes way back for you . Grandpa ? My dad , too . They didn 't do us any favours . - Well ... - Sorry . Nothing 's ever simple , is it ? I 'm gonna go inside and see how Allie 's doin ' . ( camera shutter clicks ) ( siren wailing ) What happened ? I called you as soon as I heard . I 've explained a bit of the situation to the local authorities . They 've agreed to yield jurisdiction . How 'd it go in Washington ? In my years as a commanding officer , I find I get the best results from my people when I don 't refer to them as incompetent idiots . People perform best when they 're not riddled with self-doubt . The joint chiefs seem to favour a more direct approach . We got 48 hours to find the girl . I want to thank you for steppin ' up , Captain . Colonel Breck wasn 't up to the challenge , something this--this unusual . Thank you , sir . With all due respect to the colonel , sir , what did he expect ? It 's one thing to expect something , Captain , quite another to have it bite you in the ass . That is one cold and nasty bitch . Clearly , she knows where the little girl is . I imagine she and the doctor both knew , but there was a difference of opinion on what to do about it . That is one cold and nasty bitch . MARY : That 's exactly right , General . I made a call to my guy . He 'll be here as soon as the papers are ready . Probably be tomorrow . Then we 'll get you out of here , get you out of the country clean . What is it ? There was this ... there was this message on my machine at home ... from Chet Wakeman , one of the hotshots on the project , the guy who came after you in Seattle . Right . Right . He said he wanted to help us . Then he got cut off . Probably just some sort of bluff , get us to move too quickly . Yeah , probably . Can you get your guy to hurry with the papers ? I already made that call . - This way , Miss Crawford . - Are these really necessary ? For the authorities to feel comfortable handing you over , yeah , they are . Sit down . It disgusts me to have to deal with you . I want that on the table . I understand that . When we 're through all this , I 'm gonna see to it that you 're held accountable for what you 've done . So let 's get to it , then . You knew where the little girl was , and you chose not to tell me . You wanted to keep her for yourself . I thought I 'd use her to re-establish my power base . What changed your mind ? Dr Wakeman . You 've been monitoring the reports from the Northwest , the lights ? Yeah . So far , that 's all they 've been , just some sightings of lights . He thought that this was it , they 're coming for Allie . Why don 't they just take her , then ? Because , at the moment , they don 't know where she is . She 's with one of them , the one from the gas station . Maybe he 's the one who turned her signal off . Maybe he 's protecting her . Why would he be doin ' that ? Remorse ? I came after Allie in a gas station . She escaped with the help of that alien . Allie didn 't do a thing . It sounds like she didn 't have to . No . No . She 's down , General . She 's spent . Suppose I 'm right . Suppose they don 't know where she is . Then , for the moment , they can 't protect her . For the moment . So you want to get to her before they do . I want to finish what we started . After everything you 've done . You know what the stakes are , General . He was going to warn her . Warn her ? You 're gonna have to work with me . You want to take these off ? MARY : Tom Clarke 's mother 's house , Lubbock , Texas . This is what we didn 't want you to know . You 've taken this away from me before , and it blew up in your face . When this is over , you can have me arrested , do whatever you think you need to do , but for the moment , you need someone who understands what it is you might be up against . You need me . GENERAL : I want this quick and quiet . Get our people out of Fort Ash and down to Texas . ALLIE : They will be coming soon . coming to try to stop what was going to happen next . But maybe they could be stopped . Maybe something could happen that would make it hard for them to do what they wanted to do . - How is she ? - The same . - You think they 're coming ? - It 's just a matter of time . Well , there 's no point in running unless we have a place to run to . Something like this , the government can only do because nobody 's watching . - That 's what you always said . - Yeah . I have an idea . How far do you have to go to make a phone call ? Who are you going to call , Charlie ? I 'm not going to call anybody . You are . JEFFRIES : I 've never been inside a UFO , never met one of these creatures , and yet I believe with all my heart that this is real . Why ? Because I do not believe that hundreds of thousands of people could tell the same lie . If this next caller 's who I think it is , folks , we 're in for a real treat . " Tom Clarke back again , " it says here on my screen . To what do we owe the pleasure ? Did you find something in Idaho ? Talk to me , and I 'll talk to you . It 's about that little girl the army 's been looking for . We been gettin lots of calls about her . The people who have been calling are telling the truth . I know this little girl . I was hoping your listeners could help us out . I believe we have a lot to talk about , Tom , but I have to pay my bills first , so if you 'd just hang on ... you still there , Tom ? I 'm here . Listen , Tom , we 're off the air now . This little girl ... I 've been getting these really extreme calls out of Seattle . What can you tell me about her ? For starters ... she 's my niece . It 's done . JEFFRIES : I 've got information about this girl you 've heard about on the news , on this program , and , as usual , you 're not gettin ' the whole story . This little girl , she 's a piece of the sky , my friends . Have you been taken ? Well , so has she . Have you had experiences beyond human comprehension ? Same 's true of Allie . This little girl. my friends. she may hold the key to an understanding of all that you 've gone through . The government believes it . That 's why Allie 's not safe because they 're not going to rest till they have her in their hands where they can look at her . try to figure out what this is all about . That 's why she needs your help . They can do what they do because they can do it in secret . They don 't have to stand in the light of day . If you 're on the road tonight , turn your car toward the state of Texas . If you 're in bed , get up and get dressed because they 're not gonna be able to touch her if there are witnesses . The government must be on the road already . but we have to get out there first to save this little girl . So many of you call me , e-mail me , write to me , and you 're starving for an answer . You want to know why you were taken , what this has all been about . We 're gonna save one child. my friends . and. in doing so . we may just learn that answer . Tom , Lisa , you should come see this . Their target is a little girl . Her name is Allie . She 's the focus of our government and of a race of aliens that have been visiting this planet since the late 1 940s . FEMALE REPORTER : This is the girl in question . While the government has offered a reward for information that may help them to find her . army officials deny any connection between their search for the girl and reports of troop movements from Fort Ash . Mr Jeffries. do you believe that this troop movement is related to the government search for the girl ? We have come here to Texas to see this little girl and to understand what 's been going on for all these years . Super-secret missions , government conspiracies involving UFOs and aliens ? It may all be a bit hard to swallow , but Jeffries is not alone in his belief . Tom ? Tom Clarke ? Thanks for comin ' , Bill . This is really something . I guess people really do listen to the radio at 4.00 in the morning . How 's your niece ? One of these people happened to be a doctor . She 's in there with her right now . Good . This might be a little beyond my medical capabilities . Can she travel ? Look , I 'm a multiple abductees myself . I 've been taken repeatedly since I was seven , but I ... I still don 't even really know what we 're dealing with here . This might be something better suited to their medicine than to ours . No ! No way in hell is she going anywhere near them . We 'll--we 'll find a way to help her here . Okay ... okay . I 'll leave you folks alone with your little girl . You try to be strong for your kid , you know ? " I 'm your mum . I can take care of everything . I can keep you safe . " But really , you know , there 's nothing you can do . You can 't keep them safe from anything at all . Hey ... you 've done a lot . We 're gonna be all right . Tom 's got it all set up for us . His friend brings out the papers , and we disappear into the sunset . I spent my childhood disappearing . I 'm pretty good at it . ( knocking ) - Nina . - Hi . Oh , my God ! I can 't believe you 're really here . Denny heard about it on the radio . God , is she all right ? No , she 's not all right at all , Nina . It was a series of miracles , that 's what it was . The things that happened , what they did to us , it was just a series of miracles , and the things that she can do- - there 's a kindness to her power , an intention to do good . I was really angry . I still am , I guess . But what we saw , and what she did- - I 'm with these people . After what I did to them , I 'm here with them . They were able to forgive me . That 's because of her . This is as close as we can get without getting the attention of the crowd . We 'll treat this like a riot situation , have the guards go in first , get the crowd out of there . Still , you gotta admire the move . We 're tryin ' to fly under the radar , and they put up a wall of people between us and the little girl . She must really mean a lot to those folks . Goin ' through these lengths . We 'll move in tonight . COMPUTER : Video message waiting ... Hey. there. toots . I programmed this file to send if I didn 't delete it in 24 hours . I guess I didn 't delete it . which I guess means ... you deleted me . I kinda saw that one comin ' . You must be headed in for the final wing ding about now . God . I wish I could be there . There 's something I wanted to share with you . We 're all so desperate for meaning. aren 't we ? All of us . You. too . Mary ... even if you think you 're not . You want answers . and in that way . I think the aliens are gonna disappoint you . Here 's the stone truth of it . They 're still asking the same questions we are . No one is God here . We 're all in the same boat . That was our life together . wasn 't it ? We asked questions . I used to love the way you ... I used to love the way you 'd get that faraway look in your eye whenever you were working ' something out . We could have been happy . Mary . I really believe that ... If only you 'd just let it go . That 's another question for them. isn 't it ? What is it that makes us so screwed up ? Why do we do the things we do ? Well. maybe ... they can create something better than the sum of its parts . Allie belongs with them . We 're not ready for the knowledge they have . It would destroy us . Look at me . Guess in the end . I turned out to be something of a humanist . You 're shakin ' your head. right ? See ? You do love me . What brought you here ? As soon as I heard what was happening with the little girl , I--I knew I had to be here . - How long do you think you 'll stay ? - As long as it takes . - And you ? - We all feel it . I don 't know if any of us could tell you exactly why , but we all knew we had to be here . It 's kind of hard to explain if you haven 't been taken , but ... we all knew we had to be here . The girl , Allie , is inside this house . Some say she 's resting , others say she 's dying . The question we haven 't been able to answer yet is what does she mean to this group of abductees , people who believe they 've been taken ? TOM : I really appreciate you doing this for me . No problem . Good luck , Tom . This is all of it- - passports , visas . We have a car waiting for you in the woods . An old back road leads all the way to Highway 1 77 . Dale and I took it this morning . It leads all the way past the army . We came out on the other side . They weren 't any the wiser . You ready ? ( horn honking ) We went to the sporting goods store and cleared out the hunting section . If anyone tries to hurt our little girl , they 're gonna have to come through us first . I don 't want you to do that . Allie ? MAN : Tom , could I talk to her ? Just for a moment . No . Please go back to your cars ! Bill , please help me get these people ... Folks , please ... Uh ... uh ... she 's not ready to talk to us yet . She 's just not ready . - You all right ? - I 'm fine . Listen , we 're gonna get out of here . We 're going someplace where none of this matters , okay ? Everything 's ready . We gotta go . No , not now . I want to talk to them . Hi . I know you 're all scared , and you don 't have to be scared anymore . Honey ... honey ... you don 't have to do this . All you have to be is my little girl . The rest of it , it doesn 't have to happen . You don 't have to do anything . They 're scared . They need something . You don 't have to be the one to give it to them . I think maybe I do . You have something in your heads . It lets them know where you are . I can shut them off . When they shut off , they 'll fall out . Don 't be scared . ALLIE : They won 't come for you anymore . They won 't be able to find you . No one 's going to take you . It doesn 't seem right to , uh , interfere with us the way they did . Maybe not to us , but if we saw this from someplace else , it was just time for this to happen . WOMAN : For what to happen ? Me . Listen to me ! All of you ! All of you , listen to me ! They 're not gonna do anything ! There 's too many of us here ! Do you want to help ? Stay in front of the porch ! Go to the mayor now . Get me the wireless unit . MAN : Attention ! This area is under federal control ! Please make yourselves available for immediate relocation to a debriefing area . Your vehicles and personal belongings ... You don 't listen to that ! It 's a lie ! You stay right here ! Stay right in front of the porch ! Right here ! Stay in front of Allie . Stay right here . Stay in front of Allie . We 're stronger together ! Stay in front of the porch . Just so you know , a lot of us are armed and willing to give our lives to protect Allie or take some if we have to . Get out of here now . Put your plan into action . We 'll do what has to be done . CHARLIE : Thanks . They 're here in force , come out of the night to put the monster back in the box . We better get back inside . No ... Allie ... Are they gonna come for you now ? John left that up to me . Do you think if we 'd been regular people , Charlie would have lived with us , and we could have been a family ? I know that would have happened . I don 't want to go . I want to stay here with you . Then stay ! We 've got a plan . We can get out of here right now ! It 'll be okay . Give the command . Troops ... advance ! WOMAN : Here they come . After a little girl , ladies and gentlemen ! MAN : Please disperse immediately ! If you do not disperse . you will be in violation of Federal Ordinance 860 ... endangering of public welfare ... ( gasps ) Oh , Allie . Allie , please , please don 't . Please . You heard Dale . If I stay here , people will kill each other . I don 't want that to happen because of me . Then we 'll go away . We have a plan . Where could we go ? This would all just happen again . Allie , Allie , listen to me . I am not gonna let that happen . We 're gonna get Charlie , and we 're gonna get out of here . We 'll figure out a way . There 's nothing we can do . We 're a family now . We can try . We were always a family . ( yelling and screaming ) General . I didn 't ask for this ! I want to be a little girl ! I just want to be a little girl ! ( gasps ) They 're really coming this time aren 't they ? Charlie ... I 'm glad you turned out to be my dad . I love you . I love you , too , Daddy . I have to go . No . No , I can 't . I can 't , I can 't . I won 't let you . I won 't let you go . You ... you said this was all meant to be . And I meant all of it . - This part , too . - I can 't stand this . I have to go . And I said I wouldn 't ever let you go . I love you , honey every day and twice on Sundays . I love you , too , Mama . Is she makin ' this all up ? Is this just another screen ? This is no screen , General . This is real . Can you stop them ? Can you stop them ? ! Please ! You gotta do something . This is my family . That 's my daughter ! We can 't . Allie belongs with them ... her and the knowledge of how they did all this . I 'm sorry . - That , too . - No . This is a record of everything . Even if we lose the little girl , at least we 'll still have this . Sooner or later , we 'll know what they know . Exactly . You 're the one who was gonna see this through to the end . I did . Sir ! Let her see the rest of this . She deserves that much . ALLIE : I don 't know what will happen next . I don 't know what I 'm going to be . what I 'm going to learn . but what I do know is this- - life. all life . is about asking questions . not about knowing answers . It is wanting to see what 's over the next hill that keeps us all going . We have to keep asking questions . wanting to understand . Even when we know we 'll never find the answers . we have to keep on asking the questions . Excuse me . Did you know the little girl or her family personally ? No , I didn 't . I just came to see what the deal was . Sir , shall we pick up the mother and father ? The mother and father ? You 're talkin ' about the little girl 's parents ? Yes , sir , her parents . They must have slipped away in all the excitement . I don 't see them anywhere . Neither do I , sir . Shall I tell the JTF guys to head back to Fort Bliss ? I don 't see why not , Captain . There 's nothin ' for us here . Thought you might want this . She did all right , Lis . She took the other one with her . She took the other star . She 's gonna be back , Charlie . She really is . She 's gonna be back . ALLIE : My mother always talked to me a lot about the sky . She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night . Especially the stars . We would play a game sometimes . a game called " What 's beyond the sky ? " We would imagine darkness or a blinding light or something else that we didn 't know how to name . But. of course . that was just a game . There 's nothing beyond the sky . The sky just is . and it goes on and on . and we play all of our games beneath it . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . When the light still hangs in the sky # . # . The day 's not quite come # . # . All its promises still in your own eyes # . # . Between the time your mother calls # . # . And the time you put the ball away # . # . There 's a lifetime to be lived # . # . And a world where every dream is here to stay # . # . Just before the night comes # . # . And you run back to the safety of your world # . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . You can believe in every story ever told # . # . In those last precious moments # . # . There 's a beauty no one wants to give away # . # . Well , nothin ' lasts forever # . # . But those moments keep forever far away # . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . Before you grow old # . # . Before you 're too old to pretend # . # . Just before it gets dark # . # . And you know your dreams will not come back again # . # . Hold on # . # . Hold on tight # . # . And I promise you , baby # . # . It 'll all be all right # . # . I promise you , baby # . # . It 'll all be all right # .

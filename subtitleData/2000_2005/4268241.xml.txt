 What do we got ? Doesn 't look good . Damn things been frozen since I booted up this morning and the floppy drive 's jammed . All right , let me take a look . Okay . All right , talk to me , baby . So ? Well , it 's a 20-minute job . I 'll have you up and running in two . Take your time . I 'm due for a coffee break . Yeah . Notify NORAD . Negative telemetry intercept on the missile test over the Sea of Japan . Per FBI request , the Echelon watch list is being updated with the following list . Ammonia nitrate , cyclonite and the name Ivan Benikov . Okay , listen up , everyone . The CIA station in Kandahar has been tracking Ivan Benikov , a terrorist on our watch list . Now , once we 've confirmed Benikov 's I.D. with satellite visuals , U.S. Centcom has an unmanned drone standing by to launch a hellfire missile right at him . This is so freaking cool . Uh , can I help you ? Oh , yeah , uh , act-actually , I 'm-I 'm helping you . Uh , uh , I-I 'm Jake Foley , tech support . I-I was just fixing this computer , but I 'm done . It 's fixed . No problem-o . Great , Mr. Foley . Now I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . Oh . I 'll just leave this behind just in case . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . Come on , buddy , we have talked about this . Trust me , you don 't want to be one of those jerks . Darin , I would kill to be one of those jerks . No , we 're in the perfect position because we 're practically agents , - but we 're not props . - What are props ? Yeah , props - " property of the state " - guys who actually have clearance . Those guys , they have no lives . See , you and me , we can quit anytime we want and go start a band or open up a restaurant or something because we still have that kind of freedom . Two tequila shots over here , please ? Thank you . The minute you know any kind of real secrets , like stuff you probably wouldn 't want to know if you want to go to sleep tonight anyway , that 's when they own you . And they own you for life . Darin , you 're the only guy I 've ever met whose life goal - is to keep his options open . - Cheers . Huh , God , I hate tequila . Whoo ! Dude , six o 'clock . - Pull out your NSA badge . - Why ? Because chicks dig spies . Yeah , but they don 't dig geeks . Voila . Excuse me , ladies . I 'm Agent Darin Metcalf . This is Agent Jake Foley . - Hi . - You guys work for the NSA ? - Yes . - Yes . That 's so sexy . Do you have a license to kill ? Only if you are really bad . I like that . I like that . That usually works . Yeah , that was really good . Um , I 'm going to go home . - I 'll see you later . - Oh , hey , hey . The spoils of victory do not always go to those that give up easily , my friend . Uh-huh , yeah . I 'm going to go ponder that thought at home , and I 'll see you later . Hey , leave the door open because , - uh , I don 't have a key . - Bye . Hey , stranger . - Sarah ! - It 's been a while . Yeah . I read about you in alumni notes . You 're working for Senator Thompson . Congratulations . Thank you . I see you 're still at the NSA . Oh , don 't tell me - this is your way of picking up the ladies ? No , no . No , no , no . This ... I , uh ... just got off work a little late and I didn 't even realize that this was even on . So what are you doing for Thompson ? Oh , right now I 'm reviewing department of defense budgets . Several of the research divisions have come in under budget . I 'm trying to figure out where that money went . What , you don 't trust the government ? I don 't trust my therapist , Jake . Hey , listen up , what would you think about ... - I don 't know ... - Sarah ! ... Maybe a ... - Oh . Come on over . Those are some of the most powerful aides in town . All they wanna do is drink martinis and gossip . - Do you want to join us ? - Oh ... ye ... um ... well , maybe next time . - I 'll see you around , then ? - Yeah . Oh , Jake ... what , what are you doing Saturday afternoon ? Saturday ? No plans . Wait . Uh ... can I have one of these ? - Sure . - Thanks . Um , do you think you could come by my place and check on my computer ? Something 's not right . Here 's my number . - Sure . - Great . See ya . See ya . Okay , I know you don 't smoke . Who 's the girl ? Oh , it 's Sarah . I bumped into her at the bar last night . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Georgetown Sarah ? Lived-in-the-same-dorm-for-four - years-and-never-asked-her-out Sarah ? That 's the one . She wants me to come by her place on Saturday . That 's awesome ! Why are you not the least bit excited about this ? Because she wants me to fix her computer . It 's a service call . Define " service . " I 'm serious . This is your chance . If you show up like a tech , then that 's all she 's going to see . I hate to break up the moment , ladies , but we got a server off-line . That means ' let 's go ' . You know , not a lot of people have been within these walls , so consider yourself lucky . - Foley . - Yeah ? - Foley ! - Oh . Coming , coming . Sorry . Nobody reads programming code faster than you . What am I looking at here ? Let me see . Hey . You guys know you 're off-line ? Don 't worry about it . We 'll have you up and running in two minutes . Oh , this is weird . So it says here that they 're uploading all the lab 's research into , uh ... What ? What ? Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! Since you 're obviously the smarter one , I need you to disengage the diagnostics system so that tech services doesn 't send anyone else up here . Do it . Okay . All right . We have a problem . Jake Foley , tech support . I 'm done . Nothing personal . Drop it ! You okay ? 120 / 80 . Good . That means that your blood pressure is normal . Uh ... you okay ? Jake ? What ? Uhm . I just asked if you were okay , which is an incredibly stupid question when you consider that you just saw that . Um , can I get you anything ? Do you want some water or some aspirin or ... valium ? - I 'll be okay , thanks . - Sure . Dr. Hughes . Excuse me . - Yeah ? - What 's the status here ? Well , everything seems to be fine and Hazmat 's got containment , so ... You worked with this guy for three years . - Did you have any idea ? - No . No . Dr. Gage was a jerk . I mean , this guy thinks equal opportunity is something you put in your coffee . But a traitor ? No . Never . I want to know everywhere Dr. Gage has been in the past few months - every phone call , every e-mail ... everybody 's he 's been screwing and everybody who 's been screwing him . He was with us for ten years so we know he didn 't come cheap . Is that the guy who made the distress call ? Yeah , Jake Foley . He 's tech support . He 's really shaken up right now , though , so I ... - I want to see him . - Of course . Mr. Foley , I 'm Deputy Director Louise Beckett . I understand that you made the distress call . - Nice work . - Thanks ... I-I ... but I was just doing what any good employee would do I 'm a go-getter . Yes , so I 've been reading . It says here that you applied for intel training . Yes . Twice . You 've served your agency well today , and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate your confidentiality agreement . Under no circumstances are you to recount what happened here today ... to anyone ... ever . Or what , you 'll have to kill me ? Darin ? What ? Sarah . - Jake . - Hope you like vino . Uh ... of course . - Yeah . Uh , come in . - Okay . Oh , wow . This is a great place . Rumor has it Bill and Monica had a couple of trysts here . - Really ? - Yeah , I didn 't buy it at first , but it kind of has that vibe - don 't you think ? I feel it . Oh , so here it is . Ah , the offending piece of hardware . In all its Pentium II outdated glory . Do you want me to open this ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Let 's pop it . " Let 's pop it " ? Idiot . We have a problem . Jake Foley , tech support . It sounds like you have a problem . Take care of it . ... You have a problem ... I know this guy - Eric Vaughn - black market arms dealer with ties to the IRA operating out of Belfast . Been on British CTU 's wanted list for a year now . He was behind the research theft for the SS-G-20 , their next-generation laser-guided missile . Well , our agents in Belfast will have their hands full . I 'd like your permission to head a team to track him . - No , we 've discussed this before , Kyle . - I belong in the field . - Your cover was compromised . - Yeah , through no fault of my own . - They never forget a face over there . - Come on , it 's been two years . - Listen to me . Listen to me ! - I 'm being wasted here . I 'll use my agents as I see fit . You want to work for me , you work here . Well , I can tell you already you need a new mouse . These days , it 's all about the wireless . - Really ? - Uh ... oh . Thanks . Hey , I was wondering : Who are these guys ? This one 's my dad . Oh , yeah ? Was he in , uh , Desert Storm ? Not technically . He went over to test some classified weapons system . Wow , that 's really cool . He never came back . Oh . The worst part is they won 't even tell my family what happened . He 's gone , and all they say is , " that 's classified . " Just makes me feel so helpless , and I ... I 'm sorry . Here you are , coming and doing a favor , and I 'm dumping all this baggage on you . No , no - dump on me . - Um ... - Yeah . Look ... well , it 's ... it 's like when we were in college , and I 'd come and fix your computer all the time , and you were always apologizing , and , well ... You probably didn 't know , but ... I-I-I didn 't mind . I liked helping you . I like helping you . Um ... the-the-the thing is ... - Uh ... - What ? Uh , you should probably get that . Uh . Hello . Oh , hey . How was last night ? 4 : 00 A.M. ? So glad I didn 't come . Who was there ? He was there ? Oh , my god . You fixed it . - How did you do that ? - Uh ... I , uh ... I don 't know . Jake , you don 't look so good . I , uh ... I think that , um , 24-hour flu is more like , um , a 36 , or maybe a 48 . Um ... I 'm sorry . I-I-I ... I got to go . Uh ... Whoa . Over here , mister . Yeah , here you go . - Sorry . - Hey , you all right , man ? - Sorry . - God . That guy 's got some arm . There 're rumors going around there were problems in your lab . What 's going on ? Oh , nothing , really , you know . Some shelves collapsed and some ... some of my mice got out , but , you know - no big deal . Oh , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . You mean , there wasn 't any gunfire ? Gunfire ? You kidding me ? Girl , you need to stop watching so much TV . - Jake . - Hey . Hi . Oh , uh ... - Diane . - Yeah , right . Yeah . What are you doing down here ? Oh , I just , uh , wanted to follow up and make sure your server 's running okay , 'cause that 's my job - to , um , follow up . Oh , thanks . Well , yeah , the server 's fine . - Good . - Who-whoa . So is your arm . Yeah . Yeah . I-I-I 've got one of those killer immune systems . I got to go , uh , so I 'll see you around . If you have any more problems with the server , just give us a call . Oh ! Whoa ! Oh , my god . Whoo-hoo ! What is with these double locks ? Please tell me that there was some really rough sex going on here . Darin , you are not going to believe ... You remember Casey . Ah , Yeah . Hi . Hey . I never pictured spies living like really poor college students . Yeah , that 's , uh ... that 's exactly our cover . Right . So ... Agent Foley ... don 't you have an op to go to ? Right . Come on in , come on in . Let me show you our debriefing room . You wanted to see me . Eric Vaughn is in the country . What ? Probably the east coast . Most likely D.C. How do you know ? I called some former assets . I think he 's here because he doesn 't trust anybody else to pick up whatever he paid Gage to steal . Gage failed . We got him before he managed to steal anything . We got a problem . Sarah , look , I am so sorry for barging in like this , but I have got to talk to you . - Jake . What is it ? - This is going to sound insane , - but there are these things and ... - You got to try this . It 's the guanciale , makes all the difference . Peter , this is Jake . Jake , Peter . - Hi . - Hi . - So what were you saying ? - Oh , uh ... oh , it 's nothing that can 't wait , actually . - Are you sure ? - Yeah , yeah . - It was nice to meet you . - Nice meeting you , Jack . Jake . I am so bad with names . Dinner 's ready . Let 's go Sorry . Oh . Thanks . Not a problem . If there 's one thing I 'm good at doing , it 's pushing buttons . You didn 't think that was very funny , did you ? Uh ... no , well , yeah , I did . No , you 're just being polite . My humor doesn 't translate here . Back in Ireland they 'd be dying by now . I know . Sure . Are you really , Jake ? I 'm sorry , how 'd you know my name ? Let 's just say I have an interest in you . Or rather what 's inside of you . Don 't worry , Jake . I wouldn 't hurt you . But my associate might . - Hey ! - Use a tazer ! We got to him just in time . It 's remarkable . You see how the nanites have positioned themselves along his central nervous system ? What they 're doing is establishing contact with the brain via electrical impulses , but eventually , that link will be seamless . I mean , whatever ... whatever he wants them to do , they 'll do . So this is what Vaughn 's after , some kind of future soldier . Exactly . It began as a research program for DoD . It was intended for soldiers in combat to help repair damaged tissue . But we realized pretty early on that when you 're dealing with molecular-sized computers , the possibilities are endless . I mean , this guy can interface with technology . He 's like a universal remote . And every one of his body functions is enhanced . - Meaning what ? - Meaning that ... I can hear everything ! We 're just going to run a few more tests , Mr. Foley . We 're going to have you out of here in no time . - Can I ask you something ? - Yeah . How are we going to get these things out of me ? Uh ... well ... the nanites are fully integrated into your system . They 're ... they 're part of you now . They 're not something we can take out of you . But I 'm going to be fine , right ? I mean , it 's not like they 're going to hurt me or anything ... - ... right ? - There are side effects . Like what ? Some of the lab mice experienced muscle spasms ... blindness ... partial or full paralysis . In rare cases , they rejected the nanites and the results ... not good . But that doesn 't mean that any of these things are going to happen to you , all right ? What is going to happen to me ? Honestly , we just ... we don 't know . So how long are you going to hold him ? Mr. Foley is none of your concern , Kyle . Did you even give him a choice ? Choice is a luxury . You know that . I have the agency 's interests to consider . Oh , the Agency 's interests or your own ? You 're out of line . Look , it was an accident , ... and I 'm sorry about that , but I am not going to pass up this opportunity . - Opportunity ? - Yes , we don 't know how long this guy 's going to live and we need to learn what we can while we can . Unbelievable . Lou , this guy risks his life for us and in exchange , we 're going to turn him into a lab rat ? I hope it 's worth it . You are a very brave man flying international , very brave . Between the security , the background checks ... The metal detectors , the national guard standing there - with their semi-automatic weapons ... - Hello ? - Jake ? - Oh , Sarah . I need to talk to you . Well ... now 's not really the best time . Jake , please . I 'm really scared and I have no one else to turn to . You remember what I told you about the budget discrepancies at the DoD ? - Yeah , yeah , unused funds or something ? - They weren 't unused , Jake . They were diverted ... to the NSA . - What ? - Yeah . Nobody knows what it 's for , and whoever does wants to make sure I don 't find out . - Sarah ... - No , wait . Maybe I 'm being paranoid , but . Remember when you stopped by the other night ? Ms. Neilmeyer in 3-C saw two weird guys in the lobby . The next morning , the place was completely trashed . I mean , did you see anything ? No . No . No . Uh , it was probably just a couple of guys ... kids ... pranks ... it was a prank . Look , maybe it sounds crazy , but I think I 'm being followed . We 've got visual . Target is seated in the window , speaking to a caucasian woman . ... It 's like at any minute , someone 's going to come for me . Sarah , listen to me , I want you to get up , - walk straight out of here and get in a cab - So you believe me ? Sarah , please . Go back to your office right now . You 're right . Right . We never should 've met here . What was I thinking ? Oh , I 'm sorry . My fault . You all right ? Yeah . Sarah , you got to listen to me . No , Jake , you listen to me . Meet me at the Chemdyne Research Facility , midnight , alone , or your friend is dead . - Hello . - Casey dumped me , man . She thought it was too dangerous dating a spy . You 're not a spy . Rub it in , man . Rub it in . Darin , can we talk about this later ? Uh , okay , whatever . Hello ? Darin ... Darin , I 'm losing you , man . Hello , Jake . Chemdyne Research . Kyle ? Now , just what the hell do you think you 're doing at a cryogenics facility ? What ? What ? Are you tracking me ? That 's right . I 'm sorry , Jake . I need to bring you in . Kyle , you can 't . Please , he 's got my friend . Who has your friend ? That Irish guy , the one who was coming after me . Jake , don 't do anything . I 'll have a team there in ten minutes . No , no , no ! Kyle , it 's a trade . Me for her or she 's dead . I got to go . Wait , wait ! Jake , now listen to me very carefully . I 'm tracking three figures inside the building . One of them is probably your friend . - How do I get in ? - There 's a stairwell on the side of the building leading to the roof . Now , that 's your best chance of getting around Vaughn 's men at the front entrance . Okay , okay . Thanks . Jake ? Jake ! Hold it ! uh-oh . Sarah ? Sarah ? Sarah ? Amazing . Millions of dollars in research and development and the best they can come up with is you . She 'll be fine . Just taking a little nap . Where you 're going is far more restful . What you gonna do ? - Huh , freeze me in liquid nitrogen ? - No , First I 'm going to put a bullet through your brain . Then I 'm going to freeze you in liquid nitrogen . What 's the point of that ? Unfortunately , Jake , you 've reduced your worth - to that of a carry-on case . - Wait , no , no . Listen . I can do some pretty amazing things , right ? Don 't you think people would pay more money if they could see it for themselves ? What are you suggesting , Jake ? A little bit of show and tell ? Yeah , yeah . I could do some jumping and some cool strength stuff . I can bend some ... or - or I have great vision . I can see to , like , Texas . And I can do stuff you don 't even know about . I can interface with computers , totally wireless . Incredible . And how do we suggest we demonstrate that ? Like that . Go , go , go ! Go on ! Sarah ? Sarah ? He 's dead , sir . Sarah , are you okay ? Sarah ? We 'll take care of her . We 've been ordered to bring you in . Can I offer you a glass of water , a cup of coffee ? Are you joking ? I have millions of these little things running around in my body that might kill me at any moment . I have spent the last couple of days running for my life , getting shot at because of these little things that might kill me at any moment . So do I want a cup of coffee ? No , I don 't want a cup of coffee . You know what I want ? I want my life back . I 'm afraid we can 't do that , Jake . Yeah , yeah . Big surprise . What I can do is upgrade your security clearance , effective immediately . Ye ... what ? I 've just been authorized to create a special ops team with you at its core . Whoa , whoa . Hold on . Hold on . I didn 't ask for any of this , okay ? Yes , you did ... twice . This is your big chance . Don 't waste it . Hey , bought you a gift . Oh , thank you . I guess you heard about what happened . Yeah , Sarah , I am so sorry . Sorry ? Why ? It wasn 't your fault . I was the one looking into the missing money . - What ? - That 's why they came for me . Obviously , I was getting too close to something the NSA doesn 't want us to know about . Sarah , maybe you should consider just leaving that alone . Look , I know you 're trying to protect me and I appreciate it , but I can 't let this go . You know , you don 't have to be a hero . Oh , I know . There are no heroes , Jake . Not anymore . Right . Right . Look , I just wanted you to know that ... Yeah ? Uh , that ... I 'm here for you ... uh , in case you need me . You 're the best . Thank you . # Where do you go ? # Are you looking for answers Um , okay . # To questions under the stars ? # Well , if along the way # You are grown weary # You can rest with me # Until a brighter day # When you 're okay # I am no superman # I have no answers for you # I am no hero , # ah , that 's for sure # but I do know one thing # is where you are is where I belong .

[ Dogss barking in distance ] Are you hurt ? I think God did it . Did what , Morgan ? [ Barking continues , birds cawing ] [ Barking ] Look , Lee , I don 't even care if it was him , Ad you can just have a word with him , and that 'd be enough for me . See , it was strange finding the crops that way . The kids were confused by it , and , uh , it 'd sure take the strangeness away if I know it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around , that 's all . At the movies ? Are you sure ? [ Sighing ] All right , then . Uh , thanks for your patience , Lee . Yeah . Bye . [ Telephone beeps ] Houdini peed . I think he 's sick . Why don 't you take him outside ? I 'll call Dr. Crawford . He doesn 't treat animals . Well , he 'll know what to do . [ Chain rattles ] [ Door hinges creak ; door opens , slams ] Oh . That was quick , Caroline . I only callod you folks two hours ago . Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle , as she puts it , diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards . She went down to Thornton 's store this morning and started spitting on the now skateboards . Spitting ! By the time I got there , Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damnod place . Ad she must have had a cold or somothing . I 'm toiling you , I won 't eat for a week . [ Sighs deeply ] So , what happenod to your crops ? [ Sizzling ] [ Sizzling ] Dad 's gonna burn these again . It 's contaminated . You don 't even know what that word means . It 's not contaminated . It 's just tap water . Pour it in his bowl . It tastes funny . It does not . Ad besides , he licks his butt every day . I don 't think he 'll mind . [ Barks ] [ Growling ] Houdini ? Bo , don 't run . What 's wrong , boy ? [ Growling continues ] Stop it , Houdini . [ Barks ] [ Gasps ] [ Snarling ] Caroline : Look at where it 's bent over , Father . Graham : it 's not broken . Now , what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn overr without breaking it ? Can 't be by hand . It 's too perfect . It doesn 't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers . They can 't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants . I don 't think anyone elso around here has had any problems . I was overr at Thoo Henry 's farm yesterday afternoon , and he would have mentionod somothing . Why were you at Theo 's place ? Some animals around the county have been acting funny - - and some of them violent . What is it , a virus ? I don 't think so , Father . They 're more odgy , you know , and alert . It 's almost like they act when they smell a prodator around - - peeing on themsolves and everything . [ Birds cawing ] Caroline ... please stop calling me " Father . " What 's wrong ?

There 's a monstor outside my room . Can I have a glass of water ? What 's wrong with the water next to your bed ? It tastes old . [ Breathes deeply ] [ Sighs softly ] What are you thinking about ? Why do you talk to Mom when you 're by yourself ? Makes me feel better . Does she ever answer back ? No . She never answers me either . [ Sighs deeply ] [ inhales sharply ] What ? [ Whispering ] Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back . [ Whispering ] It 's time for an ass-wh upping . This is not an intelligent way to approach this . Lee is a friend of mine . This is his son . Yeah , we 'll be doing Lee a favor . All right , liston - - we both go outside , mover around the houso in opposite directions . We act crazy , insane with anger - - make them crap in their pants , force them around till we meet up on the other side . Explain " act crazy . " You know , curse and stuff . You want me to curse ? You don 't mean it . It 's just for show . What ? Well , it won 't be convincing . It doesn 't sound natural when I curse . Just make noises , then . Explain " noises .

[ Rustling continues ] Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard ? [ Clattering ] [ Squeaking ] [ Birds chirping ] Caroline : You like that ? You got an old baby monitor around ? Bo had an old baby monitor . You can uso Bo 's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie . - - You can ? - - Mm-hmm . It only works one way , but that 'll do fine . [ Machinery whirring on tolovision ] That is , until somoone gets you an old walkie-talkie left overr at the station . Man : Stop ! it 's hideous ! Woman : Get it off ! l-l know what to do . [ Woman shuddering ] Hey , Bo ... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves . Doy-da ! [ Laser gun fires ] [ Volume decreases ] You 're too old to still be doing this . You take a glass of water , and you finish it . Now , what 's wrong with this one ? It has dust in it . This one ? A hair . This one ? Morgan took a sip , and it has his amebas in it . My turn . So , how are you , Morrill ? Fine . How is work at the gas station ? Stimulating . [ Chuckles ] I never got a chance to tell you , but l-l thought your moving in here with your brother after - - it was a nice thing to do . Well , I don 't think I 'm helping much . You are . Sorry , . Okay , so far I have , " It was very dark . " Yes , it was . You can 't describe him at all ? Don 't you think that 's kind of odd ? A little . I don 't know whother to look for a giant or a midgot . No , he definitely wasn 't a midgot . Okay . So he was tall ? l-l would say so , yes . Probably . Over 6 feet ? It was very dark . Yes , it was . How certain are you that this was a male ? Oh , I don 't know - - l don 't know any girls who could run like that . I don 't know , Morrill . I 've seenn some of those women on the Olympics . They can run like the wind . This guy got on our roof in , like , a second . O-Our roof is 10 feet high . They have women 's high jumping in the Olympics . They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean overr me . Caroline , I know you 're making a point here , but I just don 't know what it is . A out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yolling and cussing becauso they didn 't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine . She scarod a couple of the customers . No one 's seenn her since . Ad my point is , we don 't know anything about the person you saw , and we should just keep all possibilities available . [ Footste ps approach ] Dad , where 's the remote ? I don 't know , baby . Why don 't you check in the sofa cushions ? Excluding the possibility that a fomale Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our houso last night , what elso might be a possibility ? I 'm not done asking questions , and I don 't appreciato sarcasm . Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge " orsometh ing against you " - - maybe a-a chuurch member " who " - - " who might " not have liked the fact that you left the church ? I don 't think so . Okay , I was out of line with the whole fomale - Scandinavian-Olympian thing . it 's just I 'm pretty strong , and I 'm pretty fact . Ad i was running as fact as I could , and this guy , he was - - he was just toying with us . There 's only food under the sofa . Baby , why don 't you just change the channel on the tolovision ? I did . Ad ? Same show 's on every station . Every station ? Graham : Bo , turn up the volume . Crop signs first emergod in the lato ' 70s with renewed interect in extraterrestrial life . They diod out by the early ' 80s , dismissed as hoaxes . This now resurgence is wholly different . The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordi nation of hundreds of individuals over many countries . [ lndistinot conversations ] There are only a limited number of explana tions . Either this is one of the most elabora te hoaxes over created , or basical ly ... it 's for real . [ Alr hisses ] - - [ inhales deeply ] Extraterrestrials . What in God 's name is going on ? I did some research after I saw your crops . Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overrnight using just boards and ropos . Really ? That 's how these things have been done in the past . But there are so many now . How could so many people be in on it ? I can 't think straight . I 'm - - l 'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar 's coffee and - - and try to think clear . Ad after that , I 'll ... I might make some calls . But I 'll toll you somothing - - what I said in there , it still goes . Your - - your family has been through a lot . Ad the last thing these children need to do is worry , about some crazy things happening in the world . Now , take them into town and got their minds and your mind on everyday things , hmm ? Good modicine . That 's good advice . Ad you take care of yourself ... Graham . [ Engine turns overr ] Man on TV : .

Uncle Morrill , will you turn on the radio ? Woman on radio : They are signs intended " to be seen from the sky " - - [ Radio turns off ] No radio either . Just for a while . [ Sighs ] [ Brakes squeak ] Book money ? Sure . Just one . Bo back for pizza in 15 . Carl : it 's just a bunch of crock They 're trying to sell sodas . it 's plain and simple . Beenn watchhing these reports since morning . I have seenn 12 soda commercials so far - - 12 ! You have any books on extraterrestrials ? Now , don 't toll me you believe this horse manure . As a matter of fact , I think we have one . Came by mistake in a shipment - - decidod to keep it for the city people . Last row , third book on the left , honey . Man on radio : Why is no one saying the obvious ? These are just copycats . Someone somewhere does the first one ... Woman : It was asthma medici ne , right , Father ? For Morgan Hess . Ad it 's not " Father " anymore . In less than an hour , a couple hundred people got the same brilliant idea , and here we are , on the verge of mass hysteria . Can I ask you a favor , Father ? I need to clear my conscience . Will you listen to me ? Tracey ... I am not a reverend anymore . I haven 't been for six months . You know this . [ Voice breaking ] All this stuff on TV - - two girls came in here talking about the end of the world - - I 'm just a little scared . [ Sniffles ] Please , I need to clear my conscience . I 've got it figured . You do ? I 've had two soparate folks toll me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights . Can 't toll what they look like 'causo they 're staying in the shadows - - covertlike . Nobody 's been hurt , mind you . Ad that 's the giveaway . I seen . it 's called " probing . " it 's a military procedu re . You sond out a reconnaissance group - - very small - - to check things out . Not to engage but to evaluato the situation - - evaluato the level of danger , make sure things are all clear . Clear for what ? For the rect of them . Yeah ? You got a pamphlot or somothing I can read ? Sure . Thanks . You didn 't used to play basebal l , did ya ? Shit , I know you . You 're Morrill Hess . I was there the day you hit that 507-foote r overr the left-field wall - - set the record . Man , that thing had a motor on it . It 's still the record , right ? Got the bat at home o-on the wall . You 've got two minor-league home-run records , don 't ya ? Five . Why weren 't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by boautiful women ? 'Cause he has another record most people don 't know about . He has the minor-league strikeout record . Hello , Lionel . Morrill 's a clclass-A screw-up . He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time . Didn 't matter what the coaches said , didn 't matter who was on base . He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could . Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree . Morrill here has more strikeouts than any two players . You really got the strikeout record ? felt wrong not to swing . It 's contaminated . Carl , there 's somothing wrong with our water . Your water 's fine . Bo has this thing about her drinking water . She had it her whole life . It 's like a tick people have , except it 's not a tick . is that right ?

How about , " John , you 're a douche bag for kissing Barbara " ? It 's a curse . Then it 's not 37 . It 's 71 . Pharmacy crowdod ? I don 't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone . is that understood ? [ Breathes deeply ] is that him ? Yeah . [ Car door closes , engine turns overr ] Who is he ? [ Tires squeal ] [ Insects chirping ] [ Car approaches ] [ Brakes squeak ] [ Brakes squeak ] [ Static ] Merrill : What is it ? Graham : it 's Bo 's baby monitor . I found it in the basement . I 'm gonna uso it as a walkie-talkie . [ Droning ] What if it 's catchhing a signal from them ? It 's not . But it wasn 't working . Morgan , this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives . They 're , like , 30 , and they work up little oodes togother , and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secrot socioties where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in . They do stupid crap like this to feel speoial . It 's a scam . Nerds were doing it 25 years ago , and now nerds are doing it again . It 's just static , Morgan , all right . Turn it up . See . [ Volume increases ] [ Droning continues ] It 's a oode . Why can 't they got girlfriends ? Can I seen that , please ? [ Static , droning continue ] It 's noiso . It 's broken , Morgan . It 's just gonna keep doing this . Maybe some now batteries ... We might lose the signal . This is exactly what the nerds want . I 'm getting out now . [ Droning continues , volume increases ] Nobody mover . Voices . Did you hear that ? Not English , though . You heard the voices , right , Uncle Morrill ? I heard them , Morgan . [ Droning ] Probably picking up another baby monitor . That 's right . [ Pitch fluotuates ] Let me seen it . [ High-pitchod droning ] Stop ! [ Warbling ] [ Volume decreases ] See , this is why we 're not watchhing TV . People got obsessed . I 'm letting go now . Bo : No , Dad ! Morgan : Don 't do it ! You 'll lose the signal . Don 't lot go . It gets clearer the higher you hold it . Merrill : I got it . Bo , honey , I don 't want you climbing on the car . Come here . [ Volume increases ] [ Panting ] [ Droning , trilling ] Stop ! There 's two of them talking .

Let 's turn on the TV . [ Clicks , tolovision humming ] Man on TV : . It first appeared 52 minutes ago . Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either governmen t 's air force . The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space . They were not detected by radar by either country . [ Siren walls on TV ] - - The nerds were right . We have to tape this . My ballot recital . Liston , Bo , this is very important . Everything people have written about in science books is going to change . The history of the world 's future is on the TV right now . We need to record this so you can show " your " children this tape and say you were there . For your children , Bo . My ballot recital . Dad ! Find another tape . [ Videotape clattering ] [ Siren continues ] Uncle Morrill , I 'm using your tape . Man on TV : . You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City . This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way . What you 're seeing is real . it 's unbelievable . - - [ Wheezing ] - - " Everyth ing they wrote " in science books is about to change I told you . [ Alr hisses ] - - [ inhales deeply ] Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world . That 's true . Do you think it could be ? Yes . How can you say that ? That wasn 't the answer you wanted ? Couldn 't you pretend to be like you used to be ? [ Exhales sharply ] Give me some comfort . People break down into two groups when they experience somothing lucky . Group number one sees it as more than luck , more than coincidence . They seen it as a sign - - ovidence that there is somoone up there watchhing out for them . Group number two sees it as just pure luck , a happy turn of chance . I 'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way . For them , the situation isn 't 50-50 . Could be bad , could be good . But deep down , they feel that whatever happens , they 're on their own . Ad that fills them with fear . Yeah , there are those people . But there 's a whole lot of people in the group number one . When they seen those 14 lights , they 're looking at a miracle . Ad deep down , they feel that whatever 's going to happen , there 'll be somoone there to help them . Ad that fills them with hope . See , what you have to ask yourself is , what kind of person are you ? Are you the kind who sees signs , sees miracles ? Or do you helieve that people just got lucky ? Or look at the question " this way " - - is it possible that there are no coincidences ? I was at this party once . I 'm on the couch with Randa MoKinney . [ Clicks tongue ] [ Exhales sharply ] She was just sitting there looking boautiful , staring at me . I go to lean in and kiss her ... [ Laughing ] and I realize I have gum in my mouth . So I turn , take out the gum , stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa , and turn around . Randa MoKinney throws up all overr herself . [ Chuckles softly ] I know the second it happenod it was a miracle . I could have been kissing her when she throw up . That would have scarred me for life . I may never have recove rod . [ Laughs ] I 'm a miracle man . Those lights are a miracle . There you go . So , which type are you ? Do you feel comforted ? Yeah , I do . Then what does it matter ? I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they lot her die . She said , " See . " Then her eyes glazed a bit . And then she said , " Swing away . " You know why she said that ? Becauso the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she diod , and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head . There is no one watchhing out for us , Morrill . We are all on our own . [ Siren walls ] [ Keys jingle , engine turns off ] What do you know ? Well , there was an accident - - drunk driving , they weren 't sure - - He wasn 't drunk . Ray foil asleep at the wheel . - - ls he okay ? - - Yeah . That was the first thing Colleen asked , too . She 's talking . What ambulance is she in ? She 's not in an ambulance , Father . [ Floorboards squeak ] For the kids ' protection . All they were doing was watchhing TV from 5 : 00 a.m. I foIt like they were getting obsessed , like you said . They should be playing furry , furry , rabbit or tea party or somothing . What 's furry , furry , rabbit ? It 's a game , isn 't it ? Anyways , they closed the schools . Ad there 's been some interecting developments . What time is it ? 11 : 00 a.m. They 're gone , but they 're not really gone . We just can 't seen them . Early this morning , a bird flow into the area where the lights were hoverring last night . It stopped dead in the air and foil straight down . They caught it on tape . They 've been playing it all morning . The footag e looks like the bird flow into a wall in the sky . They found the bird . His - - his head was crushod in . They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going , l-like an optical illusion . They 're still there , hoveri ng . Some people think there 's more of them now ... All overr the place , overr us , even . There 's a thoory about the c- - the crop circles . They could be some kind of - - some kind of landmark , visual mapping system so they could navigato , coordinato - - makes sonso . [ Wind chimes tinkling ] Morgan : Want to hear a story ? Bo : Is it true ? So the aliens can 't read our minds . Oh . Oh , of course . They toll you everything in this book . It says they 're probably very small , like my height , becauso as their brains develop , there was no uso for physical development . It also says they 're probably vegetarians becauso they would have realized the benefits of such a diot . Who wrote this book ? Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs . That means they 're unemployed . If you 're gonna make fun of it , then forgot it . This is sorious . I don 't know what got into me . There are piotures . Dr. Bimbu , one of the authors of the book - - - - Bimbu ? - - Dad . I just asked his name . You had a tone . He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us - - to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowlodge of the universe , or the other reason - - they 're hostile . They 've used up all the resources on their planot , and they 're looking to harvest our planot next . Here . Looks a little like our house , doesn 't it ? Same windows . That 's weird . [ Telephone rings ] - - [ Gasps ] - - [ Gasps ] Yeah , oh , yeah . That 's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now . Everybody in this houso needs to calm down and eat some fruit or somothing . [ Ringing continues ] Hello ? Man : Father ? Hello ? [ Pulsating tone ] [ Footste ps approach ] [ Door hinges creak ] I 'm going out for a few minutes . No one leaves this houso - - no one . Merrill : Where you going ? [ Keys jingle ] - - Ray Reddy 's houso . Why ? I think he just callod here . [ Door opens , slams ] Bo : You don 't think someth ing bad will happen , do you , Morgan ? Why ? You have one of your feelings again ? is it bad ? I won 't lot anything bad happen to you . I don 't want you to die . Who said I was gonna die ? Who said I was gonna die ? [ Knock on door ] [ Insects chirping ] [ Insects chirping , door hinges creak ] [ Creaking ] [ Pulsating tone ] Hello , Ray . What happenod ? I wrote your number down to call you . It 's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months . When I know it was inside the houso ... I couldn 't think of any other number to call . I panicked . Thank you for coming , Father . You 're welcome , Ray . I worked so long that night . I 've never fallen asleep driving before ... never since . Don 't . Most of the ride home , there wasn 't a car in sight in either direction . If I 'd have fallen asleep then , I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache . And it had to be at that " right momen t " - - that 10 , 15 seconds when I passed her walking . It was like it was meant to be . I guess if this is the end of the world , I 'm screwed , right ? People who kill reverends ' wives aren 't exactly usherod to the front of the line in Heaven . [ Keys jingle ] [ Engine turns overr ] Wh- - Where are you going , Ray ? To the lake . The way I seen it ... these places marked in crops and such - - none of them are really near water . I don 't think they like water . Can 't be any worse than here . Did you seen somothing , Ray ? I know what I 've done to you . I made you quostion your faith . I 'm truly sorry , for what I 've done to you and yours . [ Sighs deeply ] All right . Ad don 't open my pantry , Father . I found one of them in there and locked him in . [ Tires spin ] Woman on TV : . The startling footage we 're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old , Romero Valadarez . This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son 's 7th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo , Brazil . It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago . All initial opinions are this is genuine . What you 're about to seen may disturb you . [ Children shouti ng indistinctly in Portuguese ] [ Dogs barking ] Move , children ! Vámanos ! [ Shouting continues ] [ Shouting intensifies ] Oh !

I just want to talk with you . We know all about the hoax . We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon . Just toll us your name and why you did it , and we 'll give you the same deal we gave the others . Don 't throw your life away , son . [ Sighs ] [ Knife scrapos ] [ Grunts ] [ Scrapos ] Oh ! Ah ! Oh ! [ Both scream ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Dead bolt clicks ] Their skin changes colors . That 's why we couldn 't seen them that night . Tell me somothing , Morgan . Uh ... in this book of yours ... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile ? Yes . It said they would probably invade . They would uso ground tactics - - hand-to-hand combat . They wouldn 't uso our technology or fight an airborne battle 'causo they know eventually we would uso nuclear weapons . Then the planot would be usoless to them . How could anyone possibly know that information ? it 's ridiculous . What else did it say ? They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion . One , they fight and are defeated and have to roturn again with full forces hundrods , maybe even thousands , of years lator . What 's two ? They win . I 'm sorry , what - - what book is this ? is this really happening ? [ Sighs ] I heard a thoory that , uh , they don 't like places near water . Maybe we 'd be safe from them near a lake or somothing . Sounds made-up . I saw one of them at Ray Reddy 's houso . I can 't be sure , but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me . So ... we can choose to believe this lake idea , pack up , and go , or we can stay here , hide inside our home , wait it out . We might be overrreact ing , but I 'm willing to live with that . Either way , at least we 'll be togother . All those in favor of the lake idea , ralso your hand . Yeah . All those in favor of home , ralso your hand . Okay . My vote counts as two . That 's bullshit ! You 're cheating ! Morgan , calm down . I got two votes becauso I represont two parents here . We don 't know anything yet . We 'll be safe here anyway . I don 't want to leave home . This is where we lived with Mom . That 's got nothing to do with this . I change my vote . You can 't change your vote . All those in favor of home , ralso your hand . This is ridiculous . You lose , 3-2 . [ Sighs deeply ] We 're going to board up every window in this houso . How do we know boards will do anything ?

They 're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs . They " were " for navigation . They made a map . They 're gonna be within a mile of us . Dad ? Yes ? They think these are stagod immodiatoly preceding an attack maneuver . I was wrong . They 're hostile . [ Horns honk on TV ] It 's like " War of the Worlds . " Man on TV : .

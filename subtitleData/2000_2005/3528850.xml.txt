 This pod is falling apart . It 's all I can do to keep her afloat . Chiana ? It 's not my fault , Crichton . I looked away for a microt , and Jool grabbed the controls . I didn 't say it was your fault . Give me status . It 's not holding . Oh , you 're getting mank everywhere . Shut the frell ! This is your fault ! Look , there 's Moya . Let 's just ... Pilot , Aeryn , come in ... Pilot ? That 's not Moya . That 's a Leviathan with a control collar . That means Peacekeepers . O2 level 's falling . Telemetry , comms ... neuro status . We got nothin ' . All right , we 're headin ' for that ship . That 's it . John , that is not an option ! We don 't have any options , unless you want to die out here in the middle of nowhere . It 's better than being captured , tortured and killed by the Peacekeepers . You hear that noise ? That 's our air ! We have no comms . We have no idea who , or what , is on that ship . You are leading us to our death ! All right , that 's it , everybody out ! out ! What happened here ? That smell ... if there were Peacekeepers , they 'd be here by now . Well , this section 's airlocked , so someone wants us here . D 'Argo ! What the hell 's goin ' on out here ? I told you we shouldn 't have come here ! It 's gone . Burnt , battered , busted . Ding dong , the pod is dead . It can 't be dead , Crichton . You have to fix it , and you have to get us out of here . Ain 't gonna happen , not unless we can replace that stuff . We need 3k wire and narium coils . Right . We find it , we might stand a chance and that means a scavenger hunt ... in that direction . But can 't we just borrow one of their transport pods ? There aren 't any . I already looked . No transport pods ... Not a single piece of escape craft ... It 's like anybody who could leave ... has left . This place is bad voojoo . It 's a Leviathan . Like Moya . So spare parts ... this way . I 'm getting back in the transport pod and I 'm staying there . Thank frek . Nah , you stay with her , Chiana . No way . Pip ... Transport 's all we got . I 'm warning you . I 'm gonna end up killin ' that red-headed tralk . Whatever . Go on . Spare parts ... that way . Let 's go find ' em . Frell . Trashed . Hm . And there 's no 3k wire , and definately no narium coils . Anybody home ? Anybody ... out there ? Do you want to give me a hand here ? It 's jammed . Or maybe there 's a Pilot keeping it shut . Or a host of Peacekeepers . Or thousands of feral hippie boys , friends and relatives . Too late to worry about that . Let 's just get what we need for the transport pod and get the frell outta here . D 'Argo ! Chiana ! ... Chiana ! Chiana . The comms are down ... . Chiana ! Could be the control collar . All right . We know the layout , right ? Okay , narium coils , 3k wire . Gotta be on tiers 3 and 4 . Either that , or we head straight for Pilot . Crichton ... What you got , Big ' Un ? Bones ... Sebacean bones , maybe . All right . This way . Abbott and Costello and the House of Horror . You know , we should talk to the Pilot he could tell us where to find all the stuff we need . Ah . Crichton in here . Whoa ! Oh , man , that smells worse than Rygel . Well , almost . Get in . Yeah , 3k wire . Good call , how 'd you know ? It 's a wild guess . This duct leads to the klesteron filters . We 'll have to scrape out what we can . Ho ! Oh , man , that 's pus . The ship is oozing pus , man . Yeah , the whole ship is diseased . Oh , geez . No DRD 's , what 's that about ? It 's like she got hit by some kind of biochemical weapon . Narium coils , tier 7 . Huh-uh . We gotta find the Pilot . Crichton , we get what we need and we get out . What we need ... is the guy who controls the maintenance bay doors the hangars , the whole damn ship , in fact . This is meant to be a hit-and-run mission so we get the parts that we need . And what if we 're dying ? What if we 've been exposed to some radiation , ... or some virus that 's gonna mutate us into the Night of the Living Dead ? Then , the sooner we get out of here the better ... if you want to go all the way to Pilot 's Den , then you are tinked ! Hey , you know what ? We don 't know what we 're dealing with here ! This ... is a Peacekeeper prison ship . That 's all you need to know . I 'm gonna go find the Pilot . You get the junk . What was that ? External gyro-sensor . You broke it . I did not ! It just fell ! I don 't believe this . What ! ? Where are you going ? To join the treasure hunt . Crichton said to stay here ! Well , he didn 't know about this . Well ... you can 't leave me . The comms are down . There 's a ... there 's a pulse rifle in the transport pod . How do I open this door ? You know . We don 't have weapons on our planet . We don 't have violence , we don 't have war . What the frell ? Frelling hezmana ! See ? Violence ... you 'll get the hang of it . Good luck with the pulse rifle . I hope you 're a fast learner . Holy Mother of God . Easy . I 'm not gonna hurt you . My name is Crichton . I live on a Leviathan . we have a Pilot , he 's kinda like you . What happened to you ? Please ... Kill me . Come on ... come out and play . Don 't mind me , just just talk amongst yourselves . Especially you . Stay back . Stay back ! What about your comms , atmosphere , the doors ? Can you control any of that ? My neural pods slashed . Please , kill me . Look , your arms are gonna regenerate . Growgaan cut ... Grogan ... who the hell is Grogan ? Growgaan growgaan cut ... growgaan cut ! They cut your arms ... and when they grow back , they hack ' em off again . Why the hell would they do that ? Because , because , because they 're eating me ! Stay back Stay back Stay away ! I don 't want to hurt you ! Frell ! No ! Frell ! D 'Argo ! Crichton ! F ... frell . You want lunch ? How about her ! D 'Argo ! Crichton ! Chiana ! Chianaaa ! Chiana ! Who are you ? Where 's Chiana , the Nebari ? Stay back ! Stay back or I swear , I will kill you . I don 't think that 's very polite . No ! Crichton ! Pilot ! What 's going on ? Starburst without any warning , for yotz ' sake . But we 've left Crichton and the others stranded . Votched up all my second lunch ! It better be something good , Pilot . Moya was responding to a distress call . Perhaps you can see for yourself . Talyn . Crais , come in , this is Aeryn . Crais ? Pilot , there 's no answer from Crais . Nor is Moya getting any answer from Talyn . What happened to you ? Aeryn , what do you see ? He 's been hit hard . Pilot , any other ships in the area ? Not that I can tell . Crais ? Crais ! We have ... we have to give him the death rites . Yeah ... We have to give him a proper I 'm sure there 's a bunch of Oricans around here . Damn it ! We should 'a stuck together . I wanted us to stick together . But he ... we ... No , no , no . We were too damn stubborn ! Chiana ! D 'Argo is dead ! Jool 's god knows where ... and we have been here bef ... No , we haven 't ... They 're eating the ship . This is a Leviathan . It 's like Moya . It 's alive . We have to get outta here . We have to ... we have to get out of here . Yes , we do . Okay . Okay . I can do this . I can ... I can do anything . That 's what my father told me . That 's what my mother told me and I 've never doubted them before . Maybe once or twice . But I shouldn 't doubt them . I should believe in them . And I should believe in myself . Oh , I don 't think this is right , I shouldn 't be here . I 'm a civilized being . There 's got to be someone here who recognizes that . I just need to find them . Hello ? Hello ? Pilot ? He 's disarmed . Yeah . All right , Pilot , Narium coils ... where are they ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . I get it . I - I , you know , I get it . I come forward , you scream . I move back , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . Pilot , I 'm over it . You 're gonna help me . You 're gonna give me something , and you 're gonna give it to me now ! Talk to me ... slowly . Th-this ship ... Rovhu ... was .. was ... ahh Slowly . Detention ship , prison ship ... ship for ... for the ... Kr ... Krishool ... What the hell is that ? The criminally insane . The criminally insane . We fix the transport pod ; we get out of here . We got 3k wire . That 's a start at least . He controls the whole ship , Chiana . He 's got the maintenance bay . He 's got the doors . He 's got the windows . He 's got the smoke on the water ! I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . The guy- - whatever , whoever , the one that killed D 'Argo , Dr. Spike ! Kaarvok . Kaarvok spike . Kaarvok- - that 's his name ? Bring Kaarvok ... bring him back . What 's a PK prison convoy doin ' way out here in the Uncharted Territories ? Peacekeeper convoy ... ambush convoy ... Scarrans ambush ... we- - drifting ... but not to Starburst- - not to go ... nowhere to go no one helps . We ... starve ... What 's the big fuss ? Why the red carpet treatment ? His power ... And the others , the other prisoners ? What 's their deal ? There were no ... other prisoners . Chiana ? Chiana . They 'll never get to him now . Never ever . They had a whole prison ship for one prisoner ? What about all this other vermin we 're seein ' ? The hungry-hungry-hippies ? Peacekeepers . Peacekeepers ? They were Peacekeepers . All of them . Pilot ! He 's venting the chamber ! I wish you wouldn 't talk about me behind my back . Help ! Frell ! Help me ! Help me ! No . You are not taking him back to Moya . He is still alive , Rygel . We can fix that . What are you ... ? Give me the transponder . The ship is shutting down ! Give it back . Rygel . Now ! That 's what we 're hoping for . Look , if you want to have it out with Moya you can go right ahead . Listen , you bartantic bitch . Talyn 's supposedly the meanest , deadliest , all time yave-of-the-yuvo. fighter-ship . But somebody , something ... beat the yotz out of him , and when they come back to finish him off ... we 'll be here with him . Unarmed ! And if we can keep him alive , we might find out what happened . In another arn or two it won 't matter . Let 's go , while we still can . Chiana ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Chiana ! Okay . Okay ... come on ... come ... Okay ... okay . Two Chianas . Two ... she ... she ... and me . Yeah . I 'm me . She ... she was just a clone . A clone , so ... I 'm the real me ? I 'm the real me . D 'Argo 's dead . Chiana 's dead . Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah , I can feel it . That sick , Hammer Horror son of a bitch , he 's gonna be suckin ' my brains through a sippy-straw and it ain 't makin ' me feel comfortable ! I head for the transport pod , and he runs me down like a sick lizard or we take back control . We patch your ass back in we vent the chambers and suck his ass out into space ! Pilot , Pilot , Pilot . You listen to me . We can do this . We find Jool , we take back control ! You an ' me , buddy Good things are gonna happen . Good things ! Are you comfortable in there ? Oh , do settle . You 're being very angry . What have you done to me ? D 'Argo , I saved you from the Xarai . You know , they 're completely uncivilized . What have you done with Chiana ? Chiana ... ? The Nebari ! They gray girl . Yes . Very , very , very , very nice . Really . Very nice . Were you close ? What have you done with her ? I haven 't done anything . Last I heard , she was having her best bits eaten by the Xarai . As I said , they 're uncivilized . It 's you I 'm more concerned about . What have you done with me ? I saw ... Yes ? You saw ... ? What did you see ? Another D 'Argo ? You cloned me . Not the word " clone " , please . I doubled you . I ... " twinned " you . Two D 'Argos . Equal ... and original . And tasty . I 've never twinned a Luxan before . Why me ? We 're going to make babies . Chiana in two . Two ... two of me . Two ... forked ! He copies you . That 's what he does . Two Chianas . Think ... think . Kaarvok must 've found a way to patch himself into Rovhu . Forced control system . Insta security of the Peacekeepers . Yeah , but she 's still alive . Not conscious ... life . Tertiary life support . You feel that ? It 's uh ... Crichton ... can 't work ... the console . I 'm comin ' up ! I can double you again . And again . And again . Look at the Peacekeepers . What Peacekeepers ? All over the ship . The Xarai , I call them . Private joke . I once had a tame vangern called Xarai . As you can see , once you 've been twinned thirty or fourty times ... you 're not much good for conversation . Not that you 're especially witty right now . Hold still ! I can help you get off this ship . Why should I want to do that ? Because this ship is dying . It 's rotting to pieces all around you . This is my home . All I need is more , what ... food ? Family ? Is there a difference ? D 'Argo ... you know how painful it is . I 'm willing to spare you the pain of a whole half-cycle . As long as you breed for me . Breed ? With what ? D 'Argo ... meet Belima . I - I 'm sorry ... I ... I think I twinned her a little too often . Rovhu has no power enough . Takes time to charge . Still nothin ' . No , can 't even ... lights , no use . Pilot , don 't give up here . You 're all I 've got , you understand that ? I need you big boy , and you need me . Come on ! Central plexus cable . Central ... plexus cable . Crichton ! No ! It 's quite simple , Rygel . I 'm taking the pod and I 'm collecting the others . Take plenty of food with you . They 'll be nothing here when you return . I 'll be back within the arn . You 're leaving us chained to Talyn ! Crawling along at hetch three ! Towing him ... is the only way . By yotz ! We should be Starbursting ! We can 't Starburst . You know we can 't . We can . If you try anything when I am gone ... whatever you have in the place of mivonks , and wherever they are they will be gone ... when I get back . We give her 300 microts . Then we cut ourselves free from Talyn and we Starburst . Talyn will recover . Crais may not . I suspect that now is not the right moment to abscond . Come on , damn it , John . You remember the sequence . You know the sequence . Remember the damn sequence . You know what you 're doin ' here . Come on . Hey , Kaarvok ! It 's just you and me now . What do you say we meet for some coffee or somethin ' ? I 'm sure we got lots of stuff we could talk about . We 'll cook you up somethin ' special , K-Man . It 's gonna take a little while . We 're gonna hit you with some Starburst Supreme ! D 'Argo ! Help me . Are you sure you ... I 'm not interrupting something ? Chiana ... just hurry up ! Okay . 'Cause you know I could just leave you there if - if you want ... it 's no trouble . No , no , no . Hurry , hurry , hurry . Oh ! Narium coils ! I 'm coming . Okay . Thank you . Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh ! Chains . That 's where I was aimin ' . Where 's Crichton ? I don 't know . We got separated . Maintenance Bay 's this way . Where did you get separated ? D 'Argo ... we got the stuff we need , okay ? We got the 3k , we-we-we got nar- - Pilot 's Den . Come on , this way . No , I 'll go search for him , you go back . No way . I am not gonna split up . Chiana , go get the transport pod ready . Give me a quarter of an arn , and I 'll meet you there . Kaarvey ! What 's that I hear ? Is that ... Starburst ? We can 't Starburst . We 're in a control collar . Oh , yes , we can Starburst . Just means this whole ship is toast . Schmick light show , baby . You wanna try that again ? Bring it on . Okay ... this is the best way . This is going to be quick , and it 's gonna hurt a whole lot less than being eaten ! Still haven 't learned how to use it . I nearly shot myself with a pulse rifle ! What the frell ? This ship won 't Starburst . It 's not strong enough . Maybe she just needs to recharge . I don 't think so , brain-sucker . I can arrange my own death . Hurry up , Chiana . I 'm goin ' as fast as I can . Hurry ! John ! What the hell are you still doin ' here , Kaarvey ? Others will come . More and more of you will come . To me . My ... family . My farmland ... my , my ... perfect ... perfect dish ! Crichton ! D 'Argo ! Hey , kids ! It 's dinnertime ! And it 's finger-lickin ' good ! John ! John , can you hear me ? John ! D 'Argo ! Are you okay ? Yeah , we 'll talk about it later , come on ! Jool , you 're alive . Come on , hurry up ! Chiana , let 's go ! Chiana ! Hold the door ! Jool , you 're alive ! Come on ... come on , you piece of junk ! It was over in a flash . No more than a tenth of a microt . But I saw it . I saw ... myself . Another me . Do you remember the actual moment . No , I don 't remember anything except ... it was a corpse . It was just a copy . A fake . I keep telling myself that , but then ... this Crichton- - and Kaarvok ... he said that he 'd created two " equal and original . " Boll-yotz . Kaarvok was full of it . But how do you know that I am not the copy ? Maybe the real D 'Argo is dead ? Because you just know ! You know . Frell . How is ... he ? Still tied . " I doubled you . I ... twinned you . " " Equal ... and original . " Sous-titres � Chrismich Pour Djobi

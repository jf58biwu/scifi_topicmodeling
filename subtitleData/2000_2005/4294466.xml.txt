 Seems River doesn 't want me making up a bed for our young guest . Or she 's starting a pillow collection , I 'm still collating data . - I 'm sorry . I 'll take care of the room . - It 's not important ! Tell him . Tell him what ? We want you to marry us . What ? Wait ! No ! - What ? - Two by two . Everyone a match , a mate , a doppel . I love you . River , I mean , of course , I love you too . But we can 't be married . She 's really crazy . Oh ! No ! I don 't mean crazy . That 's just ... You know , that 's not something brothers and sisters do . I mean , on some planets , but only pretty bad ones . The captain took a wife . Well , that 's also complicated . I don 't know where this is coming from . We 'll take care of each other . I 'll knit . - You don 't love me . - What 's going on ? I really couldn 't say . I was going to show Saffron to her quarters . It squared away ? Once upon a time ... I really don 't need anything . I 'm just fine . - You 're a thief . - Whoa , ho . Let 's play nice here . Your sister 's got some funny notions . That 's not untrue . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know when I was to be fed , and I was afraid . You made that fine meal , didn 't eat yourself ? That was for you , weren 't but pot-lickings left . I took this for later . I didn 't know she saw me . I didn 't see you . - There 's certainly no harm done . - And I say there is . A good deal of harm . It 's starting to tick me off . I got no use for people sneaking around , taking what ain 't theirs . Yes , we frown on that here . But what I got even less use for is a woman who won 't stand up for herself . Five days hence we 're putting you in the world , and you won 't last a day by bowing and sniffing for handouts . You want something , you take it or you ask for it . Don 't wait to be told when to breathe , don 't take orders from anyone except me . That 's just because I 'm the captain . People take orders from captains , even in the world . But for the rest be like a woman is , not some petrified child . Over 70 Earths spinning about the galaxy and the meek have inherited not a one . You understand what I 'm saying to you ? I do . Shepherd would you show Saffron her room , please ? Yes . Now we have to be married . I 'm in the family way .

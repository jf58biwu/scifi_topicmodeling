 Previously on Farscape ... No ! No ! Aeryn ! I will not be a slave to your hormones ! It 's you that I find pleasing ! Two drops from these little vials ... and we can tell if our DNA is compatible for children . It 's a whole world designed for your rutting instincts . No - no - no - no - no . Please ! You kissed our Princess ! Yeah , W - w - what the hell does that mean ? I want you ... to consider marrying her . You will rule . Not because you desire it Clayvor , if you 're not going to be king , Clayvor ... I 'm not going to marry you . When 's the last time you saw a Scarran on a diplomatic mission ? What is it , Pilot ? The ... builders . Moya 's creators . you must exchange espouses . I love you After we 're married , and I mean ... right after we 're married , they turn us into statues . Oh , hello Crichton ! My daughter or that abomination . Choose . He 's in my head . He scares me Aeryn and I can 't shake him . I don 't know what you 're talking about , but there 's never been anything we couldn 't overcome together . Except each other . Princess will you consent to marry me ? yes , Here 's your wedding present from Prince Clayvor . And now on Farscape ... Which branch are you with ? Which branch ? Janovia Chatto . Disrupter . Peacekeeper Special Directorate . Which branch ? You should know I can 't tell you that . Trust them to send in backup and not tell me . Yeah well , if it makes you feel any better , they did the same thing to me . So , what 's your assignment ? Stay close to Prince Clayvor , my vapid little fiancée ' , and if he assumes the crown , kill him . Well , that makes sense . I admire your dedication . Wouldn 't let them make me a statue for eighty cycles . Interesting coincidence , I was just having the same thought . Are you wavering ? And if I am ? Would you hesitate to kill me ... if I jeopardized the mission ? Janovia , right ? Thanks . My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . How you doin ' ? Get away from me ! How dare you ! You wanna piece of me , hm ? Wanna piece , hm ? Help guards , help ! Nope , no , no no . The guards are takin ' five so the brothers - in - law can get to know one another . Look , I 'm sorry ! If someone tried to kill you , using my name , they will pay ! You are pathetic ! You cannot strike me , I am royalty ! What do you want ? Nothing , Darling . I want ... off this planet . Now you 're gonna find a way to get Scorpius off my back . Have we company ? Your sister , she gets to marry who she wants . And you get to be King . Clayvor , I 'm trying to bathe . Oh my , the future Ms. Valiant . We 're just getting to know one another . You should get dressed . Do not try to kill me again . It makes me angry . Is everything alright ? He needs a bath and a hug . Get my mother . Get my mother ! I demand better protection for him . You cannot assault a member of the ruling house ! Well he was trying to have me killed . You bitch slapped the tralk ! We could find no evidence of an attack ! Look , the same weapon that was used on me , was used to disintegrate the assailants , okay ? By a mysterious savior that you can 't identify ! Look , I was having my ass wiped across the floor ! I did not take time ... Are you doubting Crichton ? Well , it is a weird story . You are not helping . Chiana ! I will upgrade security . I will alert the Empress . But I will not accuse the Prince of treason , without proof . But you believe me . Don 't you ? The reason your charges against the Prince will be met with scepticism , is that the Empress ... and by extension the entire royal family ... abhors personal violence . Follow me . You humiliated me . That 's enough , 'kay ? You have made your point . I don 't think I have . Clayvor went to my mother and detailed your obnoxious behavior . My obnoxious behavior ? Yes ! My brother poisoned my DNA , I know , I am not a fool . But he would never kill anyone . Well , a Scarran might . They are playmates , you know that . Look ! If you don 't want to marry me , just say so ! I already said so ! Lady , we have been over this ground with a backhoe ! It works for both of us . It saves my life , it saves your ass . Okay . I did deserve that . My mother now considers you unstable . She wants more medical tests . Katralla , listen to me . Your brother sent men to kill me . Now John cannot marry Katralla if John is not alive ! Clayvor is weak ! I cannot believe that he would participate in such a heinous act . That means you 're lying . And if so , I can 't marry you . Zhaan , there 's no doubt . The smoke tendril has definitely invaded Moya . Where , Pilot ? Which way ? Directly above you . Moving into the maintenance bay . Pilot ? Still moving in Moya 's ducts , overhead . Down the wall . Where ? Which wall ? Pilot , where ? Be calm Priest . I am the ships deity , not yours . Then you must be one of the ships builders . One of those that gave Leviathans intelligence . Anybody can give a machine intelligence . We gave her a soul . Then I welcome you aboard . I have been through Moya 's systems . She is in good health . And she has given birth . To a male offspring , named Talyn . A gun ship . Not of her choosing . While held captive against Pilots do not speak to Kahaynu . A capricious deity . He created these beasts . As emissaries of peace . Then you have succeeded , Kahaynu . Moya is a gentle soul . And is able to reproduce ships that can dispense carnage . I am here to de - commission Moya . To end her existence . Honestly Chiana , as long as Crichton 's alright , I don 't know what else I can do . Go to him ! He 's already made his decision . He needs us now ! He needs you . He needs more body guards and you said that 's happening . Have you even told him how you feel ? He knows what he needs to know . Look , Aeryn ... all men are stupid . Okay ? Men ... stupid . If you want them to know something , you 've got to tell them . I trust I 'm not disturbing you , but ... I 'm planning a trip to the edge of the Barren Lands . To watch the Poke Renos migrate . I thought you ... No thank you . I sense ... unhappiness ... that your friend Crichton is marrying our Princess . Oh yes ? And why would that make me unhappy ? I simply offer myself as a diversion . Besides , you never know . We could be uh ... extremely compatible . Now , don 't feel bad . It 's not you , it 's me . I don 't like you . Well , you certainly have made your feelings clear . So now you want to marry ? Well , it works for the situation . Look , John . I 'd like to believe you . But our investigators have uncovered no trace of the events you described . What about the guard that was killed when they came after me ? Where 's he ? He could be anywhere . Yeah , he - he - he 's everywhere . He 's in Heaven . Do we know this ? I 've never seen anything like it before . Obi Wan had one . Except his was a lot smaller . John , it 's locked ! What ? Hello ? Hello , can anyone here me ? Open up ! Hello ! Get down ! No ! Can anyone here me ? Get down ! Hello ! Hello ! Open the door ! Katralla ! Get down ! Is there another way out ? I don 't think so . Just keep your face to the floor , shallow breaths . John . This way . What ? Come on . This way . Katralla . Come on . I doubted you . I 'm sorry . Ah , it 's alright . It 's just a burden being right all the time . Your word is worthy . I will marry you . That 's unacceptable Dominar Rygel . John Crichton may not leave this planet . But I will protect him . I 've noticed how efficient that is . Security was tripled . This device was unknown to us . There was no way we could predict it 's application . You know why it 's unknown to you ? Because it 's probably Scarran . The same Scarran who 's in conspiracy with your son . Silence ! You may have once ruled six hundred billion , but you will not besmirch my son 's name ! Aren 't we past that , Novia ? You posture and deny any longer , and we both lose what we want . If Crichton leaves , he will flee . Not ... if you control the situation . Stash him somewhere . Moya 's gone , he 's got nowhere to go . At least give yourself time to identify the conspirators ... other than your son . Are you familiar with the Jekench race ? The little green creature who saved Crichton and your daughter ? Precisely . Her Elders councilor sent a ship filled with wedding gifts . It orbits unattended , unnoticed . Excellent thinking . Do you employ a detail of guards above treason ? I shall send my very own Paladins . I propose we tell no one . Not my shipmates or your daughter . Let them all think Crichton 's ... disappeared . Throw them off the scent . Encourage those who are intent on assassination , to grow careless . Precisely . You are most wise , Empress . And you are most manipulative , Dominar . This ... servant , you trust it ? With my secrets and my life . Ro 'Na will not betray us . Something wrong ? It 's so much currency ! One quarter down payment for your excellent services . Three times as much , upon completion of your assignment . Do you know what this is ? A Trans - sequence ident wafer ? Do you know what to do with it ? Yes . Good ! I predict ... that very shortly , you 'll be the wealthiest Jekench in this part of the Galaxy . Thank you ! Interesting creature . Pitiful , really . Notify Lieutenant Braca that ... at the conclusion of his mission , there are to be no ... witnesses left behind ? Oh to be there when the scales fall from John Crichton 's eyes . I take it we are clear . No one following . You show the way . Dominar Rygel said you must insert this before ascending . I 've already altered our Trans - sequence identity code , we won 't track as Leviathan transport pod . He said it was a last minute security procedure in case we 've been compromised ! I 'm sorry , I don 't understand these things . I do not like skipping out without people knowing . I ... thought that was the point ? The point is to hide from my enemies , not my friends . Your Highness , the two attempts on your life demand extreme security . And Counselor Tyno will be looking for this new code on his tracking screen . Alright . Thank you . Buckle in boys and girls . Emergency exits Hammond side . I 'm driving . Pilot ! You must arrest her actions ! Moya cannot be doing this willingly ! She is shutting her own systems down , in sequence . I cannot over - ride ! Moya ! Hear me ! Whatever this Kahaynu has done to you ... it is not in your self interest . How egocentric . As if your way was the only way . I am a priest . I have long ago come to terms with the idea that alien life practices alien ritual . But all life cherishes life ! Moya can reproduce gun ships . Moya must be decommissioned . She trusts my suggestion to guide her . You will never convince me that Moya is doing this willingly . Then let her do it . Moya . ... Fulfilled ... Moya . ... . Moya ... . ... Go ... . ... Willing ... ... Willing Yessssssssssssssss ... . ... Peace ... This is an abomination . I am so filled with uncharitable rage . Nooooooooooooooooooooo ! You weren 't going to tell us that John was leaving the planet ! It wasn 't my idea ! Grab Empress Novia by the throat if ya dare ! When did the transport pod disappear ? Immediately after passing through our weather layer . There 's been no signal from it whatsoever . Oh . Did it explode ? Not that I can tell . Was it commandeered ? Could it have landed somewhere ? No ! This is Scorpius , I 'm sure of it . No , the Scarran . Hey , hey , hey , hey . You and the Scarran ? Not a good idea . Remember the last time ? Let me try him first . I 'll uh , be with the Empress . I 'm sorry . I know the worst has being left behind . Is there a reason your ship is so far from the others ? It 's an automated cargo runner . Isolation makes it harder to find and discourages looters . And why would someone want to loot an empty cargo runner ? Only empty of crew . It is full of wedding presents for the Princess and yourself . Presents ? No , no , no , no . You have done enough . I 'm gonna talk to the Misses , you can keep the presents . You need a toaster , right ? Toaster . Toaster - toaster - toaster - toaster . Oh , I couldn 't , Highness . It 's John . Look , I 'm gonna be a statue for eighty cycles . Someone ought to use the stuff while the warranties are still good . Our Jekanch 's frown on acquisition . We live to serve , not to possess . So you don 't own your own stuff ? No . To what end does possessory well serve ? Woah , good question . Uh ... . before I left Earth I had a lot of things that were ... . very important to me . No more ? I live in a converted cell . I don 't have a a VCR , no remote control . Damn , no Charlie Parker albums - And I do miss my ' 62 T - Bird . - T - bird - T - bird - T - bird - T - bird . But , you discover you need very little . Do you miss not having these things ? Not really . Priorities change . I often wonder what I would do with wealth . Well , I tell you what . If there 's ever anything I can do to help you find it , you let me know . I shall remember those words , Highness . It 's John . Yes , Highness , yes . Poor Katralla , so unaware of what it takes . To be a slut , Jenavia ? To keep a man . I heard yours ran off , rather than marry you . Somebody tried to kill him . Probably my brother . Your fiancée . What does that say about you ? Honestly ? That I pick winners . You disgust me . Hello , ladies ! - I hope I 'm not disturbing . - Oh , let go of me ! Let go of me ! Now listen to me closely so that there 's no misunderstanding . I don 't know what game 's being played on this little planet of yours and I don 't really care . What I care about is that a good friend of mine is not hurt . - In any sense of the word . - How dare you ! And if he is , I will personally take revenge on both of your overly made up faces . He came into my chambers and he ... affronted me b - before my fiancée . I will have his head on a post ... Your Highness ... Silence ! Your gas attack on Crichton and the Princess has succeeded ! He has fled , you have won . I assume the gas attack was yours , I wouldn 't kill my own sister . Then you are perhaps unworthy to be Regent . Nevertheless , this imposter to the crown is gone . Your sister 's birth - versary approaches in two solar days . Am I interrupting ? Well of course I am . Yeah . Yeah . It 's so , so hard to conduct a conspiracy without privacy . Well ask me . I should know . What do you want ? I 'm a Nebari . You may have heard of us . Leave this room , now , child . Well , you also may have heard how ... we can defeat full Command Carriers . Not to mention uh , mind cleansing . We are both impressed and daunted . By all means Nebari , continue . So , if anything happens to John Crichton , expect uh ... expect retribution ! Yeah . Retribution . Frell . What the Hezmana was that all about ? They don 't know where he is , either . You are going to rule ! Invader alert ! Invader alert ! Twenty microts to forced depressurization . Occupant lighting mode . Reduce by half . Wow , this place has an interesting smell . It 's not exactly five star hotel , is it ? But ... at least it 's off the main road . Get down ! Don 't . Oh how disappointing you are in the flesh . Oh , I get that all the time . To think of all the energy Scorpius expended on you . Yeah . I 'm not crazy about it , either . Notify Scorpius as instructed . Sub - closed shielded frequency . A little reunion is in order , don 't you think ? I 've cut his transport loose , it 's drifting away . The Marauder that 's coming to pick us up will need to dock in it 's place . Now where 's the rest of my payment ? When Crichton 's safely aboard the Command Carrier . That wasn 't my arrangement with Scorpius . I want my payment ! Ah , that will be him , now . You do not get the toaster ! And no one knows where we are . Both yours and this vessel have radically altered Trans - sequence ident codes which identify us ... as derelict refuelers . Inventive . Evasive . In custody . My commendations , Lieutenant Braca . See to it that our ... quarry , remains secure . I want my payment . But of course . Lieutenant ... reward our Jekench friend . And at the conclusion , give her something ... additional . ... from me . Your admirable associate , Ka D 'argo was just here to see me . Of course ... since I have no idea where you are , he left feeling ... . well ... unfulfilled . Why don 't you leave me alone , Scorpy ? Because the wormhole technology locked in your brain makes you , to my knowledge , unique in the Galaxy . Unique . And unique is always valuable . Yes . Unique . Unique . Stop or I will shoot you . Really ? You promise ? Sit down ! I said , sit down . Or what ? You 're gonna shoot me ? If I have to . Do me the favor ! I don 't think so , you know ? I don 't think Scorpy ... is gonna give you your badge of Commendation if you shoot " unique " Sit down or I 'll shoot your limbs off , one at a time . Huh - uh . No - no - no . See ? Human . Sebacean . Human , Sebacean . We 're different . One wound , I bleed out ! Oh , Officer Braca ! What the frell happened ? Hm ? Fine ! Let 's do it then ! Let 's do this thing ! Come on , shoot me ! Right here , right here ! Ho ! Oh , no - no - no , not the brain , he wants the brain . The heart . Here . Heart . You shoot me in the heart . Uh ... kinda say your left , right , oh yeah , my right , your left , my left , your right . Here ! John Wayne Bobbit , Vienna Boys Choir You 're insane ! My sex life , kill my sex life ! Now , quick , shoot , just shoot me ! Pussy . Ah , get back ! Get back or the white boy gets it ! Oh man , don 't let him kill me , don 't let ... you people are so , , , dumb ! Sit down ! What 's he done ? No , no , no ! Coolant pumps , cycling fuel generation , generators cabling , weapons priming ! Weapons ? Shut down ! Shut the weapons down ! Oh , shut 'em down yourself , Braca ! Shut 'em down yourself ! Undeclared craft . You have engaged weaponry in a tactile free zone surrounding the Royal planet . - Excuse me uh , should I get this or ... - Power down your shields - Stay away from the comms ! - and identify yourself immediately . Get away from the comms ! I said , get Crichton ! Undeclared craft . Power down your weapons , and identify yourself immediately . Undeclared craft ... We 're so screwed , man ! We 're gonna die ! Quick , shut down now ! You 're insane ! What ? Did you just figure that out ? I thought that was common knowledge ! We have got to get out of here , now ! Really ? Well , alrighty then ! Do you want us both to die ? You didn 't think I was gonna do it alone , did ya ? Bye Crichton , the ship 's yours ! But I 've got the helmet ! Ah , frell , frell , frell , frell , frell , frell , frell , frell , frell , ahhhh ! Ahhh ! This is John Crichton , I 'm in the ship that 's ... this is John Crichton ... Focus , John . Panic is unacceptable , you will survive . No . You must survive . No ! You 've come too far to die . Never get off the boat . Never get off the boat , man ! Kahaynu ! Present yourself ! Kahaynu ! I will speak with you now ! Spirit of the warrior resides in your preistlyness . Spirit of an executioner within yours ! Pointless recriminations . Is there anything else you wish ? As a symbiotic part of Moya , Pilot is trapped . Build him a new ship , so he ... he does not perish needlessly . We are not prepared to do more than we have . I should say goodbye before it is too late . This is wrong . I will not allow this ! I 've um , spoken to the Empress , John . She 's not gonna do anything . Three near - death experiences in a day and she 's going to do nothing . The Empress has put Scorpius on notice . The Scarran too . Her son . Everyone . Security 's so tight , that last night , they burst into my room , just as Chiana was um ... screaming . I 'm tired of this . It 's all politics , John . As in mutual powerful kingdom . They expel someone during coronation it will have negative consequences which will ripple outwards . You know , you 're starting to sound like an old history professor . Rygel 's been very ... . excellent at teaching me . So , nothing has changed . Options ? Okay , you could run as you did before . Or you can submit , and stay here . Either way , I 'll back whatever you do . I 'm very proud of you . Really ? Yes . Why ? Being Crichton . The Crichton I always knew . Yeah ? Gettin ' my ass kicked all over the Universe . Putting yourself into a position to get your ass kicked . Fighting . Resisting . Never giving up . Aeryn , is there a way off this planet ? Have you convinced Scorpius ... to stop chasing me ? The Empress , is she no longer intent on her daughter being ... heir to the throne ? Those are not good reasons for getting married . Alright , no , bigger picture . Let 's say ... that the idiot son inherits the throne . He starts wars . He makes bad alliances , millions of people die . Eighty cycles . It 's not that long of a time . Oh , see , you 've rationalized this all out , have you ? Aeryn , I 'm tired . What am I supposed to do ? What am I supposed to do when there 's no fight left ? You run away . With you ? With all of us , together . What ? You can 't just quit ! I 'm not quitting . I just can 't go on . Was I wrong ? You 're no longer the Crichton I knew ? I 'm exploring the Barren Lands . If you think you can keep up . Moya has ... slipped from my consciousness . She is gone . And , I am shortly to follow . Don 't feel sad . Our lives were good . Moya is right , we are ... fulfilled . Pilot . It has been a pleasure . I ... am ready now . I ... have seen the stars . Hey bro ' . Glad to see you could make it . Much fortune . You 're making a uh , mistake , Crichton . Oh , I don 't think so , Scorpy . I had one request for a wedding present . That you be banned from this planet forever . Do you know what they said ? " Yes , your Highness . " Not you . In the presence of the spirit ... of all who have sacrificed , so that we may rule ourselves in peace ... . I call public the joining of my daughter ... and her betrothed in the sacred ceremony that shall ensure compassionate governance , and harmony . Shall any one among you feel cause to sway the will of love , to question the ability , the sincerity , or the destiny of this union ... rise now , and be heard . With your silence as benediction , I invite you to now rise ... and witness the crux of power pass from one generation to the next . You will now be wed . It is more obligation than honor . You are not only responsible for each other , but for the lives of your subjects . Do you accept this burden in matrimony ? Without hesitation . Without hesitation . As reigning monarch , it gives me great pleasure to formerly introduce our successors , the future Empress and Regent , of this great and peaceful civilization . Katralla , and John . Magnificent . I smell power again . Pieces of different kindling often build the strongest fire . Thank you . Ah , Father . Congratulations . Where was she , D 'argo ? You must forget about Aeryn , John . Thank you I uh , recorded ... some messages . Um , Zhaan , Pilot and ... Aeryn . Yeah . I 'll make sure they get them . Thanks . Hey , I love you . I know . Alright , alright , enough with the kissing and the cuddling . John ! I will stand beside you for eighty cycles with love in my heart . And long for the day when we may revive . It 's calibrated only for Sebaceans . Endure the pain . And rule wisely . The time has come for farewells , my friend . Oh , this is not happening . Just feel free to wake me up anytime , D 'argo . Well , now I can only speak truth . And that comes as good and bad news . Alright . Gimme the bad news first . The bad news is that you 're married . And you must endure as a statue for eighty cycles in a strange world . What 's the good news ? Chiana and I are having fantastic sex . TO BE CONTINUED

 You pull into the roll . It 's counterintuitive at first , but it radically increases your distance from the enemy . Aeryn , my module is a research craft . It 's not built for hairpin maneuvers . Would you like to learn how to do this or are you content to continually display your ineptitude ? My ineptitude ? You mean my improvisation that kind of balls your sorry military ... I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . What is that smell ? What ? It 's your hair . It smells . Zhaan gave me something . All right . It smells good . I like it . Well , it 's not for you to like . Oh . Then what 's it for ? For me to like . You don 't like that ... I like it ? Personal indulgences can fracture a small crew . I would never tell them that you scented your hair . No ! Aeryn ... Aeryn , no . No , no , I will not be a slave to your hormones . My hormones ? Hey , I was lips , you were tongue . Why did you do your hair ? Huh ? To see if you 'd notice . Standing at attention . Well , I 'll let Zhaan know that you find her oils pleasing . It 's you I find pleasing . You want some advice ? Not particularly . Makes me want to give it to you even more . Hey , there 's too much pressure . She 's scared of the future . So why not just live in the moment ? You come up with that yourself ? Go fast with the body , slow with the soul . Maybe you should find someone like that . Commander Crichton , Chiana . Please join the others in the Command at once . Okay , Pilot , they 're here . Now , tell us why have we stopped moving ? Are you familiar with Automated Peacekeeper Satellite Weaponry ? Self-Tracking Pulse Cannons ? We are locked in a cross-targeted helix . Pilot , give us immediate Starburst . - Impossible . The initiation of an energy surge will result in our destruction . Is it Scorpius ? Do you think they found us ? There are no vessels anywhere near . Then how the frell did they get here ? Perhaps from the inhabited star systems on Moya 's sense horizon . These cannons appear to be their first line of defense . Peacekeeper settlements this far into the Uncharted Territories ? Goddess help us . We got to do something . - Something useful . A representative of the inhabited system has been signaling us . By the yotz ! Run , fight , surrender . Pick one ! Moya chooses surrender . Resistance by her means death . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . I am . Oh , no . No way , Jose . You keep your mouth shut . But I am our best negotiator . Our best self-serving , to hell with everyone else-iator . Shut up . Our scan reveals you , indeed have no large weaponry or hidden cargo . Yes , and despite this ship 's Peacekeeper history , we are in no way affiliated with them . We are as stated , Counselor Tyno , peaceful . And as such , we now release you to travel as you will . You 're not going to shoot ? Well , that was a productive four arns . May we approach your worlds ? We are prepared to pay for provisions . I 'm afraid that 's impossible during coronation time . Coronation time ? I am Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth of the Hynerian Empire . Would you turn away royalty bearing gifts for your new sovereign ? Escaped prisoners bearing gifts ? Hear me , Counselor Tyno , your hatred of the Peacekeepers can never approach ours . Fate has conspired to forge this alliance . The Royal Planet will receive you . Understand , as festivities approach , we are under strict security . Weapons of any kind will result in incarceration . Was I right ? Yeah , I guess so . Was I right ? Yes , Rygel , you were right . Don 't ever forget it . Aeryn , I want to talk . I want to talk less . We tried that . It leads to kissing . Oh ... That 's a joke . It 's to relieve the tension . Wasn 't funny . Just give me some space , John . Fine . Have the whole universe . Chiana ! Yeah ! I 'm going down to the planet . You want to hang ? Yeah ! That 's good . Cool , can I come in ? Whoa , geez ! Whoa-ho-ho ! Bad time . No , good time . Sorry , wrong time . John , my life has been one crushing disappointment after the next but with this girl I have managed to find moments of pleasure . Don 't blow it for me . Never , it 's cool . I 'm happy for you . Good . - All right ? Good . - Good . How come I 'm always the last to know ? So these are the fabled breakaway colonies . When they declared independence and fled from our home systems no one gave them a chance of surviving . And yet , here they are still hating the Peacekeepers 1,900 cycles later . And every Peacekeeper attempt since then to forge a coalition has failed . I 'd say they enjoy their freedoms far too much , Aeryn . Yeah . - And why not ? Buy you a drink for a few words . You mean now that Chiana 's occupied ? Have you made a run at Zhaan yet ? Oh , that is unfair . Hi . Oh , no , no , no , no , I stopped raving years ago . It doesn 't hurt you . It 's just for the kiss . It 's no taste . Kind of like an old ... Sorry . It 's great , you know . It 's a whole world designed for your rutting instincts . No . No , no , no , no , no . Try him . He seems to love kissing . Oh , no , no . I am never leaving this world . Hey . Clavor , my sweet , there 's a Sebacean down here your sister hasn 't kissed yet . You said the borders were closed . No new visitors . And you said it wouldn 't matter that my sister could never assume the throne , no matter how many suitors they bring in . Her chemical compatibility is irrevocably altered . You will be king . Is this Crichton intelligent ? Surprisingly , despite his appearance . I find it strange , Counselor Tyno , that you 're in Coronation Time and have yet to identify your crown successor . As firstborn , it was always intended for Princess Katralla . But by law , unless she can find a compatible mate , the kingdom will fall to her younger brother . She 's a slave to our mother . I 'm the only one who 'll recognize the Scarran Imperium , even if you are the best they could send . Now , now , you two . Well , if you 're not going to be king , Clavor , I 'm not going to marry you . Excuse me , Zhaan . Why didn 't you visit the Royal Planet with the others ? My solitude is so important to me , Pilot . I barely have enough time to pursue the tenets of my priesthood as it is . Being presumptuous , I have opened all the doors on the chamber on this tier . Moya and I are pleased you have once again chosen to stay with us . Two drops from these little vials and we can tell if our ... if our DNA is compatible for children . Um , no , no . I ... Come on , what have we got to lose ? - I don 't want to . Our innocence . That 's what we 've got to lose . Ah ... Hey , hey ... It 's just a game for us , D 'Argo , okay ? We don 't play by the rules they do . The truth is , we 're not compatible . Well , only our DNA ... not the parts that make us feel pleasure . Why is he watching us so intently ? When 's the last time you saw a Scarran on a diplomatic mission ? What do you think he wants , besides killing Peacekeepers , I mean ? The same thing my former superiors wanted , a covenant with this kingdom . Go away . Go . Have you lost your mind ? Do it . Eww ! Sweet . I 'm so pleased . Me , too . How unexpected . I wish you both the very best of fortune . Thank you . Zhaan ... Zhaan ! Pilot , are you calling me ? It 's Scorpius . Scorpius has found us . Is the Command Carrier any closer , Pilot ? Still held in abeyance at the Satellite Cannon perimeter . Have they spotted our orbit yet ? Confirmed . Moya senses the Peacekeeper scan . Have we got time to retrieve Crichton and the others ? No . What if we let them see us and then ... Starburst . Scorpius may think we 're all aboard and pursue . Goddess , please send us guidance . Make this the right thing to do . Where are D 'Argo and Chiana ? Alternately exchanging body fluids and checking a tracking station to locate Moya 's orbit . Doesn 't that just figure ? Look , let 's get that drink out of your hand . - Excuse me . I 'm going to sober you up and get you out of here . Yeah , in a second , buddy . Were you once a Peacekeeper ? No . Oh , it 's Counselor Tyno , right ? Look , we got a little problem . Our ship ... Your friends have been given access to our Space Command to find your ship , but for now if you don 't mind . Look , I 'm a little partied out so if you could maybe ... Please . Okay . It 's , uh , sweet . It 's sweet . It 's kind of like molasses . Guards . Look ! Look at the Princess ! She 's smiling . Uh-oh . Cannot be ! - No , Clavor . Take your claws off me . My sister is not supposed to be compatible with another Sebacean . And as far as we know , she isn 't . Do not make a spectacle , Your Highness . The kiss was sweet ! They 're compatible ! What the hell 's going on ? For your protection . What if their DNA is cohesive ? Then this pawn , whoever he is , must die tragically within a solar day . I understand everything you 're almost saying , except am I under arrest ? Absolutely not . Good . Please , try to understand . I understand . You asked me to kiss that chick . You kissed our Princess . Yeah , and now we 're " compatible " ? What the hell does that mean ? You 're the only male we 've found who might be able to provide her with healthy children . You want a donation at the sperm bank ? I want you to consider marrying her . You would just have to be on this side of my life to understand how frelling insane that is . She will be our next Empress . You would be Regent . Others would die for this chance . See , " die . " There 's the problem . There 's the " die " part . All I ask is that you consider this blessing that 's been laid before you . " Blessing " , Counselor Tyno ? When the actual truth of power is so much closer to " curse . " What ? Stop it ! Before I speak with them , not during . She 's an ignorant creature . John Crichton , Prince Clavor , our second-in-line to the throne . First among my people . You may take the guards and leave us now , Tyno . My instructions are otherwise . This potential suitor to the throne is to remain under protective custody at all times . And whose order dares to countermand mine ? The Empress . Your mother . I will speak with you ... later . There 's always one in every family . If Princess Katralla fails to wed by the anniversary of her birth the throne goes to Prince Clavor . Uh-huh . When 's the expiry day ? A matter of solar days . Is this my cell ? Your room , yes . Where have you two been ? We 've been in the Space Command Center all night . Moya is no longer in orbit around this planet . And Flight Control confirmed that she didn 't crash , so Zhaan and Pilot probably just ... Starburst away and abandoned us . If we wanted to jump to conclusions . You know Crichton 's in custody . What ? ! - Mm-hmm . He kissed some Princess and now they won 't let him go . Of all the stupid ... You want me to jump to another conclusion ? He probably wouldn 't be in this dren if it wasn 't for you . Me ? ! - Yeah . If you hadn 't rejected him . It wasn 't my door he was last seen sniffing under . Some women consider that a compliment . Some women have to . Whoa , whoa whoa , whoa , whoa . As entertaining as this is at the moment , it 's getting us nowhere . Rygel 's with Crichton . When he comes back , we 'll have more information . As far as Moya goes , I think we should just wait . No . You 're coming with me and you 're going to show me where they 're keeping Crichton . We already tried . They won 't let you see him . Shut up , Chiana . Ka D 'Argo , is it ? I don 't believe we 've had the pleasure . I am totally unarmed . I bear you no ill will . Perhaps we should , um ... well , reorder ... and share a repast . I knew there was more to it . Scorpius . He doesn 't look at all Peacekeeper . His father was Scarran . My race . His mother , Sebacean . He knows these companions of Crichton . Crichton surely works for Scorpius . By marrying a spy to your sister , they gain the advantage with your dynasty , and block our advance . Ah ! Forgive my ignorance , sagacious teacher , I trusted you to make this work . Was that unwise of me ? You will rule , not because you desire it , Clavor , but because I do . This is Scorpius we are talking about . Yes , and it 's my life , D 'Argo . Look , the Princess is nice . She 's sweet . And it might be fun to go shopping for the rest of my life , but I am not getting married . What 's the word on Moya ? Nothing . And what difference does it make , anyway ? Scorpius has a full Command Carrier out there waiting for us , which is probably why Zhaan and Pilot have taken off . He 's right , you know . Only place we 're safe is in this palace . I 'm sorry . You saying I should get married ? - I would . You 're a polygamist . - John ? What ? - Think it through . Scorpius has offered me a deal to turn you in . What , time share at his condo in Hell ? He 's going to leave the rest of us alone and he promises not to destroy your brain as long as you give him access to the wormhole technology in your brain . And you said ... ? That I 'd talk to you about it . That 's it . I was stalling him , John ! Now , Rygel and I are in agreement about this so listen up ! You increase our chances of figuring something out the longer you at least pretend to love this girl . Love ? ! Love ? ! Rygel , there is no love . I am the reverse King Arthur . I 'm the one who can put the sword into the stone . All right . So what should we do ? I don 't care . I don 't care what you guys do . I know what I am going to do . I 'm going to tell a nice girl that I am not her ticket to the throne . Pilot , are you certain the Command Carrier is not behind us ? Positive . That was the shortest Starburst Moya is capable of . Practically an invitation for the Peacekeepers to follow . Then Scorpius has not taken our bait . Perhaps he 's already aware Crichton and the others are down on the planet . If so , that means we have abandoned our friends . There was nothing we could 've done had we stayed , Zhaan . Turn us around , Pilot . Immediately . I will attempt to plot a course back . As you know , even a minor Starburst invalidates all previous navigation points . Just do it ! Pa 'u Zotoh ! The decision to flee was a joint one . Normally , this would be a time of great joy and celebration . But I must confess I feel as if my ... As if you 're not going to be king 'cause I 'm going to marry your sister . Relax , Ace , I 'm not going to be your brother-in-law . Is this some sort of jest ? Jest ? No , it 's not a jest . On my planet , we don 't marry people we don 't love unless they 're critically-ill billionaires . No , just take it easy , bro . As soon as my ship returns I 'm off this planet , you get to be king . Congratulations . Princess Katralla , it 's good to see you again . I had given up hope of meeting a compatible Sebacean man . Yes , I wanted to talk to you about that . Look , I don 't know how to say this so I 'm just gonna ... Daughter . Mother . You must be John Crichton . With delight . - Empress . I anticipate sturdy grandchildren from you . Let us get to know one another . Have you proposed ? What ? No . No , no , no , no . I don 't love your daughter . Hmm . How could you ? You just met . Why don 't you let your son be king ? He 's a fool . He would betray our neutrality for the genuflect of peasants . And that breach would toll in hundreds of millions of lives . Yeah , starting with mine . I have no purpose for you other than to keep my empire stable . If we recognize the Scarrans , Peacekeepers attack . Packed with Peacekeepers , Scarrans invade . You must wed Katralla . Empress , I understand your problems , but you need to understand , there 's nothing you could say that 's going to make me marry your daughter . Oh , hello Crichton . Something to remember me by , Crichton . I have traveled a long , long way just to see you again . I hate to say that you wasted your time , Scorpy , but you have . You know that no matter what you think , the rift between us need not be terminal . Go away , Scorpy . It 's over . Find another girlfriend . Now , don 't let her frighten you , John , hmm ? Now , you make the correct decision . My daughter or that abomination . Choose . Bad ? Enough . She 's strong and gets what she wants . What about you ? Rarely . So what do you want ? To be Empress . To have children . To keep the peace for my people . Even if we 're miserable for the rest of our lives ? I won 't make you miserable . I 'm sorry . Princess Katralla ... will you consent to marry me ? Yes . What do you mean , you have no choice ? - No choice . - Rock , me , hard place . Fight , retreat , remain silent . Scorpius . The Empress ? You disappoint me , Crichton . You should lower your expectations . Well , at least the Princess is pretty . Yeah , I guess so . And wealthy . I suppose so . Think of all the power you 'll have . Yeah , I can 't stop thinking about it . That , and how I 'm going to get off this planet the way I got here , single and alive . Well , I 'll see what I can do ... - Congratulations . Sorry ? Marrying our Princess . Dregon Karzenova , Cousin to the Crown . John Crichton , Astronaut . Katralla 's a lovely girl . I wish you great happiness . And , uh , you would be ? Extremely preoccupied . Excuse me . Perhaps some other time , then . We 'll do lunch . Seemed like a nice guy . Stop it . So , any word on Moya ? I think she got spooked by Scorpius 's Command Carrier . Yeah , spook . Spooky . That 's a good name for him . He has that effect . On you ? - On everybody . How many guards have you seen since you got up here ? Too many . That 's right . They 're protecting me , from him . Look , the Empress , this is her ball game , but if you have some suggestions , now would be a good time . I 'm just trying to figure out what they 're hiding from us . Well , see if you can figure out someone else to marry the Princess . And if I can 't ? Better wed than dead . Hmm . Oh , Tyno . I believe my mother will truly force me to marry this stranger . We can only hope . " We can only hope " ? ! What am I supposed to say , Katralla ? You 're supposed to say , " No , stop this travesty . " You 're supposed to say , " I will not let you marry that man . " You 're supposed to take me away from this madness that is my life . There 's too much at stake to stop this now . You must exchange espousals . But I love you . As I love you . But our union is not destined to be . You must go to Crichton . You must do your duty . Crichton is such a frelling fool ! He had no choice . Oh , please . Princess Pretend doesn 't even love him . She wants that Tyno . You 're forgetting about Scorpius . We can hide from him in the barren lands outside the city until he leaves . Marrying her is the only thing that will save Crichton 's life , Aeryn . Don 't you get that ? - I have had just about enough of you . No , no , no , it 's not me that you 're mad at . You should have told him how you felt when you had a chance . You don 't know anything . Yeah ? Well , I know about men . You see that one over there ? How many times has he tried to come on to you ? What , three , four ? Look , he 's well-bred , he 's rich , handsome , perfect . You 're going to let him get away , too . You know why ? Oh , go on , tell me . Because you only want the ones you can 't have . So you 're going to go to Crichton , you 're going to mess with his mind . He 's going to be turned over to Scorpius , and dead . This marriage is wrong , and you both know it . Pilot , why are we still moving further away from the Royal Planet ? Moya is following a signal of some sort , and refuses to give up the trail . Does she know that Scorpius did not follow us ? Does she know that we have to return to the planet to help our friends ? Yes , but she 's driven forward . What sort of a signal is it , Pilot ? Impossible to describe to our satisfaction , but one of her eight senses clearly identifies it as ... familiar and compelling . Oh , perfect . I don 't believe I 've had the pleasure . Yes , I 've heard that about Scarrans . Perhaps we could talk for a moment , in private . I have a message for Scorpius . Scorpius ? I know you work together . I saw your Luxan with him . Go ahead . We will not tolerate your interference so far out in what you condescendingly call the Uncharted Territories . Is there anything else ? Yes . Is your presence here the vanguard of a larger invading force ? I shall send your regards to Scorpius . I had hoped to learn your mind by conversation . However , if I must invade it ... Don 't stop now . Go on , kill each other . Save me the trouble . My apologies Empress . I rarely bother with warnings . Consider yourself the beneficiary of largesse . Empress . Listen carefully , Peacekeeper . The longer Crichton plays the part he 's been assigned , the more likely we 'll keep our internal organs ... internal . Do not dissuade him from this marriage . Thank you , Rygel . I 'll do what I think is right . For Crichton , or for you ? Just a small burn , Princess . Almost finished . You know , you take any more samples of my DNA there 's not going to be enough left to be me . What species are you ? Since you 're not Sebacean . Human . I keep trying to tell you guys that , but nobody seems to want to listen . We still don 't . The Empress has ordered the revelation sealed . No one will ever know . It 's that important that I marry the Princess ? Our dynastic integrity has always ensured peace . Any fracture , and the whole region could erupt . Then why don 't you marry her ? Her DNA was poisoned . Unreceptive to anyone , until you . Would you activate the machine for me , please ? Her brother . Very discerning . With help , we believe , from the Scarran Emissary . John . Come look . Oh , this is truly amazing , Crichton . I must have one for my kingdom . Boy or girl ? I 'm sorry , what ? The DNA testing confirms our incipient kiss . Our children will be healthy , disease free . And you can see what they 'll be like . Oh , how many nasty surprises could I have avoided ? Male infant , please . Oh ... Hey , buddy , what 's up ? Where 'd you come from ? Look at you , slugger . This is ... this is what our child would look like . One possibility . The choice is ours . Hey , you the man . You the man . Would you like to see him grown-up ? Yes , please . Not , not too grown-up . Hi , Dad . An astounding device ! Oh , uh ... looks just like you . Yeah , he does , kind of . Yet , he may be able to overcome it . Thank you . That 's all . Not to be obtrusive , but the royal tailor would like to see you for a fitting . You 're scheduled to meet members of the royal family court , and you must work on a pose for your Governance Statue . Statue ? Get out of town . All right , fine . Well , on Earth , we have this queen . She 's got this wave . I 'll do that . Hardly a pose you 'd like to hold for 80 cycles , I 'm afraid . Wh ... well , what 80 cycles ? I just assumed you knew . Knew what ? ! Crichton 's DNA is compatible ! It 's not a trick ! Then your loyalists must assassinate him . You really frelled up this time , Cargo . This is not part of our bargain . Scorpius is here because your mother let him attend . Ah , so , now it 's my mother 's fault ? I have half a mind to tell her about you . You do have half a mind , Your Highness . But will you actually reveal our pact ? Can you see past childishness to realize any betrayal means your instant death , even if mine follows ? Yes . I am curious , dear Jenavian , to know of your loyalties . As I interrogated your loving fiance , what was going through your delicate little mind ? I was hoping you wouldn 't wear that to our wedding . Destiny 's couple , you are . Why has Moya brought us here , Pilot ? I don 't know . Moya continues to be evasive with me . However , I assume it has something to do with that . What is it , Pilot ? Is it alive ? Yes . Does Moya know this living thing ? Yes . Who is it ? The Builders . Her Creators . Her god . Did you hear about the statue ? Hey , Chiana . 80 cycles . 80 cycles . That is roughly 80 years to you and me , and ... over 500 years to dogs ! Why don 't you stay and tell us about it , John ? Did you know about the statue when you were convincing me to marry the Princess ? I don 't know about it now . After we 're married , and I mean right after we 're married , they turn us into statues . That is fascinating . Excellent . D 'Argo discovers science . To what purpose ? Governing Continuity . They screw with our molecular structure , turn us into pigeon perches and we preside over their senate or whatever they call it , for 80 cycles . As a statue ? Yeah . We can see , we can hear , don 't ask me how , and we 're supposed to absorb every single facet of their governmental system . That way , when mom and pops finally kick it , we rule . Perhaps that 's why they 've endured 1,900 cycles of peace . It works . You 're like a brochure . You have to go through with it , John . 80 cycles . My college loans will be delinquent . I 'll miss the strippers on my hundredth birthday . I 'll get a utility bill for three trillion dollars for a single porch light that I left on and everybody I know will be dead ! The alternative is having your brain dissected by Scorpius . Humans do not live as long as Sebaceans or Hynerians or Delvians . When I get back , everyone , my Dad , D.K. , my sisters , Cameron Diaz , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , will be dead . Well , you may never see these people again anyway . Hope , D 'Argo . It 's what keeps you going . You 're gonna see your son . I 'm gonna get home . Hope . I have hope ... or I 'm nothing . Look at what fate has given you . Scorpius will no longer be a threat . And as a ruler , you 'll have power , peace , prosperity . You could , uh , create a family . Perhaps you 've only just discovered your true destiny . Hey , you 've been spending way too much time with Chiana , you know that ? Amongst all the fluff , she can make a lot of sense . Our time was good , John . We had each other when we needed each other . But now it 's time to go past your fears , see what 's down the road ahead . If I do this ... you have to be my best man . Uh ... I 'm with Chiana now , John . Do you talk ? When asked to , Highness . So , uh ... you work for the Royal Family . For 22 cycles . Since Katralla and Clavor were children . I 'm happy she has found you as a mate , Highness . No , uh , lose the " Highness " part . I 'm John . Call me that . I am ro-NA . - ro-NA ... Could you give us a moment alone , please ? So , you 're going to listen to D 'Argo over me , are you ? Is that right ? The Empress has made it clear . I marry her daughter or she hands me to Scorpius . 80 cycles as a statue ? It 's better than Scorpius ! Is it ? He 's in my head . Back of my mind , corner of my eye . He scares me , Aeryn , and I can 't shake him . I don 't know what you 're talking about , but there 's never been anything we couldn 't overcome together . Except each other . I can 't come to the wedding . I want you there . Don 't be absurd . I need you there . Aeryn , I ... don 't you think that there are things to say ? At this point , what else can we say except goodbye ? You 're right . You 're always right . Bye . Welcome to Barbie world . They 're almost ready for you , Highness . Here 's your wedding present from Prince Clavor .

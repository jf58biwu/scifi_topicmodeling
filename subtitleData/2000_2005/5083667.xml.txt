 The Sting [ SIREN WAILS ] A hush comes over the crowd . The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings ! And he slices into the water ! Man ! [ GROANS ] Boy , I tell you , buddy . Bad news , everyone ! You 're not good enough to go on your next mission . - Hooray ! - Not good enough ! - Why ? Says who ? - Because . And says me . It 's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew . - And you 're not nearly as good as them . - Woo-hoo ! We live to suck another day ! [ SINGING ] Oh ... . We 're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths . - What 's the mission ? - collecting honey , ordinary honey . - That doesn 't sound so dangerous . - This is no ordinary honey ! It 's produced by vicious space bees . A single sting of their hideous neurotoXin can cause instant death ! That 's if you 're not allergic . You don 't wanna know what happens then , no , no . Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano ! I didn 't want to know ! These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly . Larger than an American sedan ? How big is the honeycomb ? Honeycomb 's big . Yeah , yeah , yeah . - It 's not small ? - No , no , no . It 'II take more than deadly , deadly bees to keep us from doing our job . - Come on , boys . - But , LeeIa , we 're no good . Listen , I 'm scared too . But I 'm more scared of disappointing myself . I 'm not scared of that at all . Now , bees communicate by dancing . Like my parents ! Oh , wait , that was hitting . LEELA : So this language cartridge will let you distract them . Ah , good . I often have thoughts that can only be expressed through dance . [ BUZZING ] Bender , quick ! WaggIe something ! [ BUZZING ] LeeIa , Iet 's turn back . There 's absolutely no shame in wussing out . relax , everything 'II be fine . Oh , my God ! The old planet express ship ! There 's the black box . MAN 1 : Captain ! The bees have us surrounded ! oh , the professor was right ! - We 're not as good as his old crew ! MAN 2 : Well , I aim to prove him wrong . It 'll take more than a few deadly , deadly bees to- - oh , Lord ! [ SCREAMING ] I couldn 't make that out . Too much static . BENDER : Eww . We found it ! The honeycomb hideout ! - Hey , what 's this goop ? - royal jelly . They feed it to the queen . Bees make honey and jelly ? How come nothing humans make tastes good ? [ YELLS ] help ! I can 't swim in jelly , as far as I know ! Look ! It 's a baby queen ! She 's so cute ! You adorable , wittIe , itty-bitty , fuzzy , wuzzy- - LeeIa , stop bonding and let 's go ! I got jelly in my underpants ! I 'm taking this bee with us . With a queen , we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves . Let me just pack her a lunch and we 'II go . Pick up the pace , lady ! I 'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks . [ BEES BUZZING ] I didn 't mean you 're all fat . Just Fatso there . [ BENDER YELLING ] help ! This is where we distinguish ourselves from the Iast crew . Activate emergency high-speed , seIf-contained escape pack ... ... crisis response units . Quick ! [ SCREAMS ] [ BENDER YELLING ] FRY : Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ah ! Ooh ! Ah ! LEELA : Good luck , Bender ! I 'm back , baby ! - We made it ! We 're alive ! - Burn on that old crew ! The only things they did better than us were suck and die . LeeIa , we got lucky this time , but you should be more careful . - I don 't want anything to happen to you . - Thanks , but I can look out for myself . - frankly , I can smell danger a mile away . - Look out ! You want her ? You 're gonna have to go through me ! You call that a wound ? That 's a boo-boo , tops . But thanks for trying to save me , Fry . Fry ? [ LEELA GASPS ] He 's ... . He 's dead . Oh , who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now ? It was all my fault ! He died because of me ! No , no , no , no , no , no . I 'm lying to make her feel better . Husband , can 't you go anywhere without lighting something up ? It 's an old Jamaican accounting tradition . We burn his timecard . That way his zombie doesn 't come back looking for his final paycheck . He looks so natural . It 's funny to think he 's crammed full of sawdust and preservatives . I only wish I couId 've removed the stinger . [ GONG SOUNDS ] I barely knew philip . But as a clergyman ... ... I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him . Soothe us with sweet lies . It may comfort you to know Fry 's death took only 1 5 seconds . Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 1 5 years . And it goes without saying , it caused him to empty his bowels . [ GASPING ] We now commend Fry 's body to the ages . He 's walking on sunshine now . This makes me the oldest member of my family . Him do good snu-snu . Eh ... . AII those times I said , " kill all humans , " I 'd always whisper , " except one . " Fry was that one , and I never told him so ! farewell from the world of tomorrow ! They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain . Mm . It 's good . I feel funny . Ha-ha funny . Huh ? - LeeIa ? - Fry ? I thought you were dead . Nope , I 'm better than ever . Before the accident , I couldn 't do this : Impressive ! But it does sort of support my you-are-dead theory . Then I 'II prove I 'm alive by telling you something only I couId know . There 's a surprise for you in my locker . I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left . It 's too beautiful to open . Can I open it ? Sure . There 's just one thing I want you to do . - What ? - I want you to wake up . Wake up ? But I 'm not- - [ NIBBLER YELPS ] In my dream , Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker . If it 's true , then he must still exist in some form . Of course he still exists . As a frozen corpse in outer space . Oh , I made myself sad . well , here goes . - Oh ... . - Bupkis . [ WHISTLES ] well , I feel better now . Pawning all the stuff in Fry 's locker helped give me closure . - Was there a gift for me ? - No , nothing . Not at all . No way , Jos√© . Here it is . - You took this from Fry 's locker ? - The guy 's dead . There 's no law against grave robbing . [ LEELA GASPS ] [ SQUEAKS ] That proves it ! Fry is alive somewhere and he 's reaching me in my dreams ! bull pies ! Lay down here and we 'II do some tests . If Fry is out there somewhere ... ... LeeIa 's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board . - Is this some sort of brain scanner ? - Some sort , yes . In France , it 's called a " guillotine . " Professor ! Can 't you examine my brain without removing it ? Yes , easily . Hey , what if Fry wasn 't actually dead when we buried him ? - You know , Iike julia Roberts . - well , I suppose there 's a sIim- - [ BEEPING ] [ GASPING ] I don 't believe it ! What is it ? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something ? No ! According to this Gizmometer , Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back . - remarkable ! - But , my dream ! Your science can 't un-prove that . How could I have known ... - ... the gift was in Fry 's locker ? - Easy . He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out . Are you saying I 'm going crazy ? No , no . No one 's saying that . But I 'm certainly thinking it loudly . [ MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY ] Hi , LeeIa . I 'm just gonna keep talking even if you can 't hear me . - blah , blah , blah . blah , blah , bIah- - - Shut up ! I can hear you ! The professor says you 're just a dream . Oh , yeah ? could a dream take you dancing in a Vanusian garden ? well , yes , technically . But it 's still very sweet of you . Then what if we shared a midnight sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion ? Oh , Fry , you must be alive . I 've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before . Here , take my jacket . You look a little cold . Thank you . It 's all so beautiful . I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be . I just wish I couId convince the others you 're alive . You can ! AII you have to do is wake up . No , no ! Don 't say that ! This is real ! [ NIBBLER YELPS ] Not another dream ! Fry 's jacket ! The one he was buried in ! My dream was real ! He 's alive ! [ BANGING ON WALL ] WOMAN : Quit your bragging ! My boyfriend 's alive too . [ THUDDING ] Oh , not anymore . [ SCREAMING ] That 's better . Fry 's alive ! I have proof ! - What ? - You do not ! I 'm from Jamaica , the " Show Me " island . So show me you blowing it out your fanny . But he gave me his jacket . Look ! That 's not Fry 's jacket . Fry 's jacket is red . That 's your jacket . An off-the-rack Iime-green affair . But Fry- - His jacket- - And when I woke up it was on me ! You 're under a Iot of guilt stress , LeeIa . Here , work it out . I am not under stress , damn it ! FARNSWORTH 'S VOICE : Everything 's going to be all right , LeeIa . What ? AMY 'S VOICE : Everything 's going to be all right . Maybe I am freaking out a little . A little ? You 're screwier than my Aunt Rita , and she 's a screw ! I need to calm down . I better take some more of that space honey . You 've been taking space honey ? Be careful , you purpIe-haired imbeciIe ! One spoonful calms you down . Two spoonfuls help you sleep . But three spoonfuls , and you 'II go into a sleep so deep ... ... you 'II never wake up . Never ! FARNSWORTH 'S VOICE : Never ! AMY 'S VOICE : Never ! One spoonful to calm me down . Okay , I got a pretty good calm going . Two spoonfuls to help me sleep . Uh-oh . still awake . I guess one more spoonful couldn 't hurt . Oh , my gosh ! I better get a sponge ! Fry ? Is that you ? I don 't need a sponge ! Why am I sticky and naked ? Did I miss something fun ? incredible ! According to the Gizmometer , Fry touched the royal jelly ... ... in the space hive , leaving an imprint of his DNA and brain waves . Then , when it spilled on the couch ... ... it recombined with trace amounts of Fry 's hair and skin- - And blood ! Don 't forget about Fry 's blood . Yes , Bender , thank you . In short , the various fluids Fry left in the couch ... ... caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being ! - Neat . - This is great ! My buddy 's alive and his credit cards are valid again . Let 's go get hammered ! [ CHEERING ] I should warn you , I 'm a mean drunk . - Fry , I 'm so glad I didn 't kill you . - Me too . feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad . - But now everything is all right . - Not everything . - What ? What do you mean ? - You have to wake up . Wake up ? Oh , no . No ! It can 't be ! Poo ! I 'm cracking up . In my dreams I 'm happy because Fry is alive . But when I 'm awake my mind plays tricks on me . - Take it easy , LeeIa . - In every life we have some trouble . But when you worry , you make it double . [ SINGING " DON 'T WORRY BE HAPPY " ] - Uh , were you just singing ? - No , I was telling you not to worry . I 'm not allowed to sing . Court order . I 'II find Fry 's coffin , get his corpse ... ... and keep it under my mattress to remind me he 's dead . That 'II prove I 'm not insane . [ STRAUSS ' " ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA " PLAYS ] Okay , it 's just an ordinary coffin ... ... containing my ordinary dead friend , who I killed ! What happened ? Why am I in my apartment ? You killed Fry ! You killed Fry ! - You killed Fry ! - Stop it ! Stop it ! You killed Fry . [ BENDER YELLS ] Okay , I 'm insane . But I 'm still sane enough to know it . The only time I feel all right is in my dreams with you . Three spoonfuIs , then I can dream forever . One . Two . Here goes . Goodbye , waking world . LeeIa , no ! Listen to me ! You don 't want to lie in bed and do nothing the rest of your life . - I 've tried it . Bedsores hurt ! - Then what am I supposed to do ? - Fight it ! - I can 't ! You can ! The LeeIa I know doesn 't give up this easily . Okay , I 'II try . [ BUZZING ] Go away ! I don 't know if you can hear me . But there 's something I wanna tell you . - I Iove you . - I 'm so scared , Fry ! - I don 't know what to do ! - Just wake up , LeeIa . please . - Just wake up . - I don 't understand what you mean ! Just wake up . please . Just wake up , LeeIa . - Fry . You 're alive . - LeeIa ! You 're awake ! Of course I 'm awake . You wouldn 't stop waking me . Where am I ? In a hospital . The ambulance took you here after the bee stung you . But the bee stung you . It barely touched me . The stinger went through me and you got all the poison . My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle . Vroom , vroom . Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth , she 's awake ! [ CHEERING ] You were in the best coma I 've ever seen ! The doctor said you 'd never wake up . - really ? How long was I out ? - Two weeks . Fry never left your side for a minute . And he talked nonstop . Like a parrot of the sea , he was . I thought maybe if you heard a familiar voice ... ... it might help keep your mind together . - But who knows if it really got through ? - It got through , Fry . It got through . LEELA : You could really use a shower . FRY : You too . subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

 Over here . bull 's-eye . - Yes ! - Too tall , too tall . - Jayne ! - little man ! Yes ! Come on , old man . - Right behind you . - Yeah ! hello . - Who 's winning ? - I can 't really tell . They don 't seem to be playing by any civilized rules that I know . well , we 're pretty far from civilization . - How 's your sister ? - She 's good . Better . She has her days . And she still won 't talk about ... ... what they did to her at the academy . INARA : Perhaps she 's not sure herself . Open . Good eye . Good eye ! She dreams about it . I know that much . Nightmares . And now on the run , on this ship ... ... I don 't know if I 'II be able to help her here , and I need to help her . Simon , you are . Leaving your whole world behind ? It 's incredibly selfless . Yeah . I selflessly turned us both into wanted fugitives . We 're all running from something , I suppose . [ ALARM SOUNDING ] Proximity alert . - We must be coming up on something . - Oh , my God . What can it be ? We 're all doomed . Who 's flying this thing ? Oh , right , that would be me . Back to work . So I guess it makes us one man short . Yeah , little KayIee 's always one man short . Say , doc , why don 't you come on down ... ... and play for our side . Inara won 't mind . [ YELLS ] - Wash , you have a stroke or something ? - Near enough . ZOE : What happened ? [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] - Anybody home ? - Been hailing her . But if whoever 's there is as healthy as the guy we just ran over ... ... can 't imagine anybody 's gonna be picking up . Bring us in closer . Get you close enough to ring the doorbell . What is it ? It 's a ghost . MALCOLM : So , what do we figure , transport ship ? Converted cargo hauler . Maybe a short-range scow . You can see she don 't wanna be parked like that . The port thrust 's gone and that 's what 's making her spin the way she is . A short-range vessel this far out into space ? Retrofitted to carry passengers . travelers pick them up at government auction . A few modifications ... ... and they serve well enough for a one-way push to the outer planets . settlers . Cram 1 5 or 20 families on a boat that size , you pack them in tight enough . families ? JAYNE : tell you what I think . I figure that fella we run into did everyone onboard . killed them all . Then he took a swim , see how fast his blood would boil out his ears . You 're a very up person . - ShouIdn 't we report this ? - To who ? alliance ? Right . They 're gonna run here Iickety-spIit ... - ... make sure these tax-payers are okay . - Then we 'II have to . If they 're in need of help , why aren 't they beaming a distress call ? It 's true . There 's no beacon . Which means no one 's looking to find her . AII the more reason for us to do the right thing . How 's about you just say a prayer when we slide on by ? shall I remind you of the story of the Good Samaritan ? I 'd rather you didn 't . But we 'II check it out . could be survivors . And if not , well , then ... ... no one 's gonna mind if we take a look ... ... see if they left something behind . Yeah- - No , someone could be hurt . Where do you think you 're headed ? I thought I 'd offer my services ... ... in case anyone onboard required medical attention . well , cap and Zoe are going in first . We 'II holler if we need you . - Something wrong ? - Hm ? Oh , no . No , I ... . well , I suppose it 's just the thought of a little mylar and glass ... ... being the only thing separating a person from nothing . It 's impressive what nothing can do to a man . Like that fella we bumped into . He likely stuck up under our belly about now . That 's what space trash does , you know ... ... kind of latches on to the first big something stops long enough . Hey , now , that 'd be a bit like you and your sister , wouldn 't it ? MALCOLM : Entering adjoining air lock now . Okay , Wash , ask Serenity to knock for us . Emergency power 's up . Dashboard light . Whatever happened here happened quick . ZOE : Everything was left on . Ship powered down on its own . No sign of a struggle . - They 're just- - - Gone . Sir . personal log . Someone was in the middle of an entry . [ SOBBING ] It 's okay . It 's okay , I 'm here . Bad dreams again ? No , I can 't sleep . There 's too much screaming . River , there is no screaming . There was . Hey , grab your med kit , Iet 's hoof it . mal wants us both over there on the double . - They found survivors ? - Didn 't say . Right . I 'II ask Inara to look in on River . Whatever . I ain 't waiting . I 'II meet you there . But don 't take forever . still gotta get suited up . [ DOOR SLAMS ] Hi . What are you doing here , and what 's with the suit ? You 're hilarious . SIMON : Sadist . - AII right , enough . Ain 't got time for games . As long as you 're here , you might as well lend a hand . You roll with kaylee . Let 's be quick about this , all right ? A few loads each . Don 't be greedy . - Where are the people ? - Ship says Iifeboat launched a week ago . We 're gonna assume everyone got off okay . We 're here to pick the bones . Start in the engine room . Jayne , you take the galley . You had this on wrong . Sir ... ... I count 1 6 families signed on . - Lifeboat wouldn 't hold a third of that . - I know . Wash , any luck ? Think I found something that matches that class . Layout looks about right . Seems to me any valuables , if there are any ... ... likely be stored somewhere C-deck aft . Good work . Keep the engine running . River ? It 's Inara . Are you hungry , sweetie ? River ? SIMON : Aren 't you the least bit curious ? - About what ? well , what happened here . Why would anybody abandon their ship in the middle of nowhere like this ? For all sorts of reasons . Just not mechanical . What ? There ain 't nothing wrong with this . Not that I can see , anyhow . Whew ! well , here 's a good one . hold the bag open . This looks to be it . - Locked . - well , now ... ... I 'd say that 's like to be a very good sign . Here . Gen-seed , protein , crop supplements . Everything a growing family needs to make a fresh start on a new world . Hard subsidies for 1 4-pIus families . - That 's- - - About a fortune . Forget the rest . We just take this stuff . We 're gonna need a hand hauling it out of here . Sir ... ... even on a lifeboat ... ... you 'd think those who escaped would find room for some of this . - Nobody escaped . - Sir ? Nobody . ZOE : My God . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] I know what did this . Get her out of here . Jayne ? Jayne , drop what you 're doing and get to the engine room . I want you to take KayIee and the doctor off this boat . Don 't ask questions . [ YELLING ] MALCOLM : Jayne . Captain ? Captain . Zoe ! Came from above , sir . The galley . KAYLEE : We heard shooting . - River , what are you- - ? - I followed the voices . - Don 't ever leave the ship . Not ever . Okay , handle her , will you , son ? WASH : What in- - Is going on in there ? - Not now , dear . What 'd you see ? Didn 't . It came at me from behind . Big , though . Strong . - I think I might 've hit him . - You did . MAN : No . No , no- - MALCOLM : Easy , now . No one 's gonna hurt you . No . No mercy . No . - Any more than we already did . - No mercy . well , we got lots of mercy . We got lots and lots of- - Oh , yes ... ... he 's a real beast . It 's a wonder you 're still alive . Looked bigger when I couldn 't see him . - I wonder how long he lived like that . - I know . He must be real brave to survive like that when nobody else did . Yeah , real hero , killing all them people . KAYLEE : What ? No , we don 't believe that . We don 't , do we ? Captain wouldn 't have brought him onboard were that the case . pulse is rapid . blood pressure 's high side of normal , to be expected . Weak . They were all weak . Other than the bullet wound , there isn 't any exterior trauma . Though that crack to the head probably didn 't do him any good . cattle . cattle for the slaughter . Dope him . - I don 't think that- - - Just do it . No mercy . No resistance . Open up . See what 's inside . No mercy . So how 's our patient ? Aside from borderline malnutrition , he 's in remarkably good health . So he 'II live then . Which , to my mind , is unfortunate . Not a very charitable attitude , captain . - Charity 'd be putting a bullet in his brain . - MaI . We 'd save him the suffering . AII right , no one goes in here . Nothing more we can do , not after what he 's seen . What do you mean ? The ship was hit by Reavers . Reavers ? [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] INARA : mal , how can you know ? JAYNE : He don 't . That 's how . No way . It was that other fella , the one we run into . Like I said before , he went stir-crazy ... ... killed the rest , then took a walk in space . - Just a second ago you said that- - - Don 't matter . Wasn 't Reavers . Reavers don 't leave no survivors . - strictly speaking , wouldn 't say they did . - What are you suggesting ? Don 't matter we took him off that boat . It 's the place he 's gonna live now . I don 't accept that . Whatever horror he witnessed ... ... whatever acts of barbarism , it was done by men . Nothing more . Reavers ain 't men . Of course they are . Too long removed from civilization , perhaps , but men . And I believe there 's a power greater than man . A power that heals . Reavers might take issue with that philosophy . If they had a philosophy . And if they weren 't too busy gnawing on your insides . Jayne 's right . Reavers ain 't men . Or they forgot how to be . Now they 're just nothing . They got to the edge of the galaxy , that place of nothing ... - ... and that 's what they became . - Why are we sitting here ? - If it was Reavers , we should be gone . - Work ain 't done . still substantial money value sitting over there . I ain 't going over there with them bodies , no rutting way . - Not if Reavers messed with them . - Jayne , you 'II scare the women . SIMON : I 'II go . - I 've dealt with bodies . - I 'd Iike to go with him . Maybe see what I can do about putting those folks to rest . Those folks are already resting . Reavers saw to that . How we treat our dead is part of what makes us different ... ... than those did the slaughtering . AII right . You go say your words . Jayne , help the doctor and Shepherd Book cut down those people ... - ... then you 'II load up the cargo . - I don 't believe this . - We 're sitting put for a funeral ? - Yes , Jayne . That is exactly what we 're gonna do . I won 't have these people looking over my shoulder . I ain 't saying there 's any peace to be had , but on the off-chance there is ... ... those folks deserve a little of it . Just when I think I 've got you figured out . That was real pretty , captain , what you just said . Didn 't think you were one for rituals and such . I 'm not . I figure it 'II keep the others busy for a while . No need to concern them with what 's to be done . Sir ? MALCOLM : It 's a real burden being right so often . - What is that ? - Booby trap . Reavers leave them for rescue ships . Triggered it when we latched on . - And when we detach ? - It blows . Okay , so we don 't detach . We just- - - I don 't know , sit tight untiI- - - What , Reavers come back ? Looks like they jerry-rigged it with a pressure catch . It 's the only thing that 'd work with these spare parts . We could probably bypass that easy , we get to the DC line . tell me right now , KayIee . You think you can do this ? Sure . Yeah . I think so . Besides , if I mess up , it 's not Iike you 'II be able to yell at me . [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] No . No . [ CRIES ] [ SCREAMS ] What 's going on ? well , right at this particular moment , I 'd have to say , not a thing . Right ? - Not a gorram thing . - Looked like a thing to me . Thought we had a situation , but it looks to be taken care of . Let 's get that merchandise put away . Everyone 's home , Wash . Let 's go . [ ALARM SOUNDING ] No , no , no . Don 't you say that . It 's the Reavers . - The gorram Reavers come back . - Get that stuff stored . - Like it 's gonna matter ! MALCOLM : Just do it ! Reavers ? MAN : Firefly-class transport , you are ordered to release control of your helm . Prepare to dock and be boarded . Looks like civilization finally caught up with us . No mandatory registration markings on the bow . Make sure we cite them for that . Sir , we 've identified the transport ship they were attached to . It was licensed to a group of families out of Bernadette . They were due to touch down in newhall three weeks ago . Never made it . Once we secure these vultures , we 'II send a team over . Didn 't we have a flag on a firefly a while back ? Check . Here it is . An alert issued on an unidentified FirefIy-cIass ... ... believed to be carrying two fugitives . A brother and sister . What are they wanted for ? It 's not available . It 's classified . 40,000 of these in the air , and that 's all they give us . well , I 'm not about to have any surprises on a routine check . We run into these two , we shoot first . The brass can sort it out later . - What was it ? - Open the stash , pull out the goods . - Just got done putting it in . - I 'm telling you to take it all out again . - Why for ? - I got no notion to argue this . In about two minutes ' time , this boat 's gonna be crawling with alliance . No . - We 've gotta run . - Can 't . They 're pulling us in . If they find us , they 'II send River back to that place . To be tortured . I 'd never see her again . Stack everything here in plain sight . Don 't want to seem like we got anything to hide . Might give them boys the wrong impression . - Or the right one . - That too . Go run and fetch your sister . What ? Are you gonna put her in plain sight too ? - Don 't get touchy . Just do as I say . - Is that why you let us stay ? - To use us as bargaining chips ? - Knew there was a reason . They 're not taking her . You 're not giving her to them . Don 't be a fool , son . Do as the man says . well , quite a Iot of fuss . If I didn 't know better , I 'd think we were dangerous . - Is this your vessel ? - Bought and paid for . I 'm Capt. MaIcoIm reynolds . - And is this everyone , captain ? - By way of crew , it is . Though , in our infirmary , you 're gonna find a fella we rescued . Saved him , guess you could say . Straight through the back , next to the common area . And these items , I take it you rescued them as well . [ LAUGHING ] Looks like an illegal salvage operation . It does ? That 's discouraging . alliance property too . You could lose your ship . That 's a wrist-sIap compared to the penalty for harboring fugitives . A brother and sister . When I search this vessel , I won 't find them ? No children on this boat . I didn 't say children . siblings . adult siblings . I misunderstood . No chance they could 've stowed away ? No one would blame you . I know how these oIder-modeI FirefIys ... ... tend to have those troublesome little nooks . Do they ? smugglers and the like tend to prefer them just for that reason . [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] We will continue this conversation in a more official capacity . - I want every inch of this junker tossed . - Junker ? settle down , KayIee . But did you hear what that purpIe-beIIy called Serenity ? MALCOLM : Shut up . COMMANDER : You are a companion . INARA : Yes . And you were based for years on Sihnon . It 's only in the Iast year that you 've been with The Serenity ? It 's just " Serenity . " And that 's correct . In a few weeks , it will be a year . Why is this important ? I 'm just trying to put the pieces together . It 's a curiosity , a woman of stature such as yourself ... ... falling in with these types . Not in the least . It 's a mutually beneficial business arrangement . I rent the shuttle from Capt. Reynolds , allowing me to expand my client base . And the captain finds that having a companion onboard ... ... opens certain doors that might otherwise be closed to him . And you love him ? - I don 't see how that 's relevant . - He is your husband . Yes . COMMANDER : You met through Capt. Reynolds . ZOE : Captain was looking for a pilot . I found a husband . Seemed to work out . - You fought with ReynoIds in the war . - Fought with a Iot of people . - And your husband . - Fight with him sometimes too . Is there any particular reason you don 't wish to discuss your marriage ? Don 't see that it 's any of your business , is all . We 're very private people . The legs . Oh , yeah . I 'd definitely have to say it was her legs . You can put that down . Her legs and right where her legs meet her back . actually , that whole area . That and above it . KAYLEE : Six gerstlers crammed right under every cooling drive so you strain your primary artery function ... ... and you have to recycle secondary exhaust through a bypass system ... ... just so you don 't pump it through the main atmo feed ... ... and asphyxiate the entire crew . Now , that 's junk . Have you seen what she wears ? Forget about it . Have you ever been with a warrior woman ? Pirates . Pirates with their own chaplain . There 's an oddity . Not the only oddity this end of space , commander . We have things not always so plain as on the central planets . rules can be a mite fuzzier . These fugitives that we 're looking for , the brother and the sister ... ... they were last seen on Persephone . That a fact ? They also left port aboard a FirefIy-cIass transport . About the same time that you shipped out with Serenity . well , Persephone 's a big place . Yes . Yes , it is , and that firefly isn 't . And if anyone 's hiding anywhere on it , we will find them . So I figure by now you 've been over to the derelict , seen for yourself . Yes . terrible thing . If you want my advice , you won 't tow it back . Just fire the whole gorram thing from space , be done with it . That ship is evidence . I 'm not in the habit of destroying evidence . Of course not . It 'd be against the rules . I 'm gonna make a leap here ... ... and figure this is your first tour out here on the border . It 's a very loyal crew you have there . But then , I can tell by your record you have ... ... a tendency to inspire that quality in people , sergeant . It 's not sergeant . Not anymore . War 's over . For some , the war will never be over . I notice your ship 's called Serenity . You were stationed on Hara . battle of Serenity valley took place there . You know , I believe you might be right . Independents suffered a crushing defeat there . Some say after Serenity , the browncoats were through . The war ended in that valley . Seems odd you 'd name your ship after a battle you 're on the wrong side of . May have been the losing side . still not convinced it was the wrong one . - Is that why you attacked that transport ? - What ? You 're still fighting the same battle . only those weren 't soldiers you murdered , they were civilians . Citizens trying to make a new life , and you just can 't stand that , can you ? So we attacked that ship , then brought the only living survivor to our infirmary . - Is that what we did ? - I 'd ask him . only I 'm not sure he can speak with his tongue split down the middle . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] I haven 't seen that kind of torture since ... . well , since the war . I should 've known . You are bound by law . formal charges will be transmitted . Commander , I 'm not what you need to be concerned about right now . If things go the way they are , there 's gonna be blood . - Let 's start compression . - AII right . Get a line in . Reavers ? That is what I said . You can 't imagine how many times men in my position hear that excuse . - " Reavers did it . " - It 's the truth . You saw them , did you ? - WouIdn 't be sitting here if I had . - No , of course not . I 'II tell you who did . That poor bastard you took off my ship . He looked into the face of it , was made to stare . - It ? - The darkness . Kind of darkness you can 't even imagine . BIacker than the space it moves through . Very poetic . They made him watch . He probably tried to turn away . They wouldn 't let him . You call him a survivor . He 's not . A man comes up against that kind of will , the only way to deal with it ... ... I suspect , is to become it . He 's following the only course left to him . First , he 'II try to make himself look like one . Cut on himself , desecrate his flesh . And then ... ... he 'II start acting like one . Let 's have two MPs up here to escort Sgt. ReynoIds to the brig . Let 's go again . Later . Maybe . Captain said once the coast is clear ... ... we should lay low in the shuttle . Come on . Coming back ? Yes . Yes , of course he is . They all are . COMMANDER : Your ship will be auctioned . The proceeds will be applied to the cost of your defense . [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Get him out of here ! Go to full lockdown . I want guards on the nursery . It won 't matter . You won 't find him . But I know where he 'II go . Wait ! No . Don 't . Don 't . River , it 's okay . - Wait . Wait . - They 've gone . Come on . - Don 't . - River , it 's okay . - Come on . - No . Don 't- - River , you don 't have to be afraid . Why would he come back here ? Looking for familiar ground . He 's on the hunt . AII right . Let 's get him to the brig . - No , no , no . I should go with you . - It 's out of the question . How many men you feel like losing today ? Nobody knows Serenity like I do . I can help you . We let him go first . Right . You want to ... . Thanks . Now I 'II really have the advantage . We don 't know how long it 's going to be . Once we 're settled , we shouldn 't move much . I 'm just gonna grab some food . [ FOOTSTEPS ] Someone 's coming . [ YELLING ] You save his gorram life , he still takes the cargo . [ SPEAKS GALACTIC LANGUAGE ] He had to . CouIdn 't let us profit . WouIdn 't be civilized . subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

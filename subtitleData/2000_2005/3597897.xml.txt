 Easy there , hon . You 're cleaning so hard I 'm afraid you 're going to stick the dog in the dishwasher . [ Softly ] Hey . Come on , now . Quit it . This is what we dreamed about . What we prayed for . I know . I 'm sorry . [ Sighs ] I just can 't stop wondering why . Why give up a child ? Give it up to strangers ? God has his reasons and his ways . Mr. And Mrs. Van de Kamp . Hi . This was so hard to find . I 'm so sorry but there 's a page here that didn 't get signed . If I can just get you to do that now . - Okay . - Here we go . Right there . Thanks . I keep asking myself a question . I know there 's been a medical exam ... but are you sure he 's okay ? Now , honey . Why would the mother give him up ? You should understand ... this was a life choice by a single mother and a terribly difficult decision for her . But I can say it was only for the good of the child . I want you to meet William . ? William was a bullfrog ? ? Was a good friend of mine ? ? Never understood a single word he said ... ? [ Raspy Breathing ] ? ... And it must have been some mighty fine wine ? ? Joy to the world ? ? All the boys and girls ? ? Joy to the fishes ... ? [ Faint Clatter ] ? ... In the deep blue sea ? ? Joy to you and me ? ? If I were the king of the world ? ? I tell you what I 'd do ... ? [ Raspy Breathing ] 1,492 . [ Panting ] 1,493 . 20 . They don 't pay me enough . [ Raspy Breathing ] [ Elevator Dings ] [ Elevator Dings ] [ Doggett Groaning ] Right there ! Hands in the air ! Turn around and step forward . Step forward . Let 's go , tough guy ! All the way down ! [ Elevator Dings ] Agent Reyes . Agent Scully . Do we know who he is ? He says his name is Miller but he has no identification on him . Beyond that , we don 't know a lot . Why are the lights off ? He wouldn 't speak with them on . What do you mean ? If you saw him in the light , you 'd understand . Something 's wrong with his face . He 's been severely burned by fire or maybe acid . And he says he knows me ? And that he 's afraid . A victim of what he calls the alien conspiracy . [ Footsteps ] You won 't talk to me . You going to talk to her , Mr. Miller ? [ Raspy ] If she 'll help me and protect me . You better hope she 's feeling more charitable than I am , partner . Agent Scully . He 's under arrest for assaulting a federal officer . I 've explained to him the penalties but he still refuses a lawyer . How did he get in the building ? We found a card key on him . Says it was given to him by Fox Mulder . His name is Miller ? Daniel Miller of Fredericksburg . He gave us an address but we 're still working on the confirmation . What are you doing here ? I came here to find answers . - Answers to what ? - To this . What they did to me . From your scarring , it appears that you 've been burned . Are you claiming that someone burned you and that there is evidence here to incriminate them ? According to Fox Mulder the men who did this are part of a government conspiracy . Go on . You know who these men are . Did Mulder tell you that too ? When ? If I were to tell you that you might use the information to find him . Mulder doesn 't want to be found . When I searched him I found those X-Files stuffed inside his clothes . [ Doggett ] You know who that is ? That 's his sister . Whose ? Mulder 's . She was abducted from her home when she was a little girl ... part of this same government conspiracy . You seem to know a lot , Mr. Miller . It gives an impression either that you are telling the truth or you just want us to believe that you are . If I thought you 'd believe me , I wouldn 't have snuck in here . Agent Doggett . Would you please arrange the transfer of this man to Quantico ? I 'd like to personally examine his injuries . [ Soft Squishing ] From the tissue quality , your scarring is fairly recent ... the extent of it severe but it 's not from burning or chemicals . No . What is it then ? Mr. Miller ? I was injected . Injected with what ? I don 't know . It burned . Throughout my whole body inside and out . Agent Scully , Agent Reyes . I need to speak to you . What is it , Agent Doggett ? I 've been out running this man 's supposed I D. There 's seven Daniel Millers in Fredericksburg but I can tell you , he isn 't one of them . Then who is he ? I got an idea but you 're not going to believe it . Well , who is he ? You asked him how he got in the fbi ... how he knows what he knows . He said that he contacted Agent Mulder ... that Mulder told him ... I don 't think so . I don 't think Mulder told him anything . I think that how he got in here and the reason he knows what he knows is because that man in there is Mulder . [ Laughs ] That 's ridiculous . It 's absurd . Is it ? What is true and what we want to be true aren 't always the same . I 'm telling you , that 's not Mulder . I hope you prove me wrong . Can you open your mouth , sir ? I need to look at your dental work . You 're not going to tell me I need braces , are you ? [ Chuckles ] Now your eyes . Are you going to help me ? I don 't know how I can . Help me make them pay for this . You , uh ... refer to them as if I know them or know where they are . They did terrible things to you too when you were abducted . Sir , you 've given us a false name . We know that your name is not Daniel Miller . No , it 's not . What is it ? I can 't say . Why lie to us , if you want us to help you ? Because there are people working here at the FBI who would kill me if they knew I was being held here . The same people who would kill Mulder . You can put your clothes back on . I 'm asking for your help . But I might be able to help you . How can you help me ? You 're looking for answers too . [ Mulder ] We 're both looking for answers . It 's not him . It 's not Mulder . You 're absolutely sure of that ? Yes . And so will we all be once you bring me back his DNA tests . What do we do with him now ? Well , admittedly he 's lying about who he is but the danger to him may be real . I think we need to figure out what it is that he wants and then see if he lies about that too . How are we going to do that ? Well , first , I think we need to quietly get him back to DC . To FBI headquarters . You came here looking for something . What is it that you hope to find ? I didn 't find it . [ Reyes ] You stole several files pertaining to the 1973 abduction of Mulder 's sister . But yet you say there 's danger to your life right now . The conspiracy to keep the truth about aliens from the American public all but destroyed a few years ago has given rise to a new conspiracy in the government now by men who are alien themselves . And what does this have to do with you ? What you can see they did to me was a failed attempt to turn me into one of these alien men . I was a guinea pig ... a test subject . And now I want to expose their evil plans . What plans are those ? To do this to you ... to everyone . Mulder said there were files here ... cases like mine . He gave me names and case numbers but I don 't see them . They 're not here . Someone 's already removed them . Yes . Who ? This is what you 're looking for . You trust me ? Thank you . What are you doing ? Proving Agent Doggett wrong . That that 's not Mulder in there . How ? I don 't understand . Mulder and I agreed to take those files out of the X-Files office and leave them here for safekeeping . Mulder would have known where they were . And that man in there didn 't . [ William Crying ] [ Crying Continues ] What are you doing ? ! Get away from the crib ! He was crying ... It 's none of your business ! I 'm sorry . I 'd heard so much about William . Mulder told me how he missed him . Well , if that 's true , then where the hell is he ? Just tell me where he is ! You don 't want to know . I have to know . He 's in pain ... terrible pain . Then let me go to him . There 's nothing you can do . That 's not for you to decide . You know as well as I that 's Mulder 's decision . I ... He begged me to honor it . For your safety ... and William 's . Here , Dana , let me take him for you . No . Please . May I ? I wanna hold him . Mr. Miller ... No , it 's important I do this . I want to hold him for Mulder . [ Cooing ] He 's so beautiful . [ Door Opening ] Assistant Director . You said you 've spoken to the lab . I got some advance info on the exam that Scully performed on the man . What ? The blood type matches Mulder 's but there are aspects of the physiology that aren 't a match . Such as ? Well , the body mass , of course . He 's shorter and weighs considerably less than Mulder did . You haven 't seen this guy ... what they 've done to him . The way he 's twisted , he 's like an old man . He could be a hundred years old . I 'm just relaying the facts . And the fact is , he 's not a hundred years old , is he ? Not the way he attacked you . Well , whoever he is , he wants something . He says he wants revenge against the people that burned him . And Mulder directed him to the place where he could find the files and the people who did it . That doesn 't make any sense . Mulder knows those files inside out . Why would he direct him ? Why not just tell him ? [ Phone Ringing ] Skinner . Yeah . You 're sure about that ? All right . What ? That was the lab . They were able to rush the PCR test and they came up with a definitive DNA result . What is it ? Where is this man right now ? It 's all been a good act . I don 't know what you mean . I think you do . You knew those files were here . You just pretended not to so that I 'd bring you here to see William . No . I want the truth from you . What truth ? The truth that you won 't speak . I want the same truth you do . Don 't do this to me . Not you . I didn 't come here to upset you . I didn 't plan on being caught . I know you must have a hard life living alone raising a son not knowing whether you 'll see Mulder again . How do you know my life ? I know what Mulder knows . I know they used you to create the child . I know they continue to use you to take care of it and raise it . What are you saying ? You know what I 'm saying . Your son ... your child is part alien . Just tell me who you are . Come on , just say your name . Say it ! Just say it ! Agent Scully ... Could you please leave ? And close the door ? Can you step out , please ? This was a private conversation . I understand . I 'm sorry . Do you know who that man is ? Yes , I do . Agent Scully ... What is this ? What ? [ Doggett ] We got DNA results . A positive I D. It 's not him . He wouldn 't say these things . The DNA 's a match to Fox Mulder 's . It 's not him . Can we get you anything ? No , thank you . I just need a minute . Where 'd he go ? I don 't know . I 'll go check the nursery . Monica , stay with Scully ! Hey ! [ Rattling ] No more running , Mulder . We 're going to protect you now . [ Doggett Panting ] Give him some time . You 're going to live , buddy . That 's going to scar . We 're going to talk , but first you 're going to get some sleep . So , what now ? What do you mean ? What do you want to do ? Keep it a secret , for starters . Well , that 's not going to be hard . [ Sighs ] Nobody 's ever going to believe that that 's Mulder . Somebody did this to him . Whoever that is is going to know it 's him . I mean , that 's what he 's afraid of . If he 's so afraid , then why did he run ? You still don 't believe it 's him . You know a person in so many ways . Ways that a test can 't even begin to know . Look , I 'll be happy to run his DNA again for you but I don 't have to tell you what a long shot it is . I mean , it came up a perfect match . You asked why he 'd run . Stop and think how hard this is for him . I mean , the way he looks . If that was Mulder , I wouldn 't care . But he cares . He has to . Maybe he 's ashamed . Of what ? [ Sighs ] Not just the way he looks but you let him go to protect him only he couldn 't protect himself . You believe that ? [ Sighing ] I don 't know . We 'll have a better sense when he wakes up . [ Coughs Softly ] [ Velcro Ripping ] [ Baby Crying ] Is he okay ? [ Baby Continues Crying ] [ Scully ] Oh , my God , there 's blood ! Oh , my God ! There 's blood on the sheets . [ Scully ] What 'd he do to him ? What 'd he do to him ? ! [ Crying Continues ] Where 's Dr. Edwards ? I 'm Dr. Newman . I 'm going to take your baby . He 's been injected with something . Take him to Trauma . Airways are open . Lungs are clear . Heart rate slightly elevated . Skin is warm . Nondiaphoretic . I spoke to another doctor , a woman ... Dr. Edwards . I 'm Whitney Edwards . Agent Reyes ? - Yes . This is Dana Scully . - Do we have any idea what he 's been injected with ? I 've no idea . I don 't know . We 're going to run some tests ... I 'm a medical doctor , okay ? Can I ... Good . Then you know what this is all about . You just need to sit tight for me and let us do our job . What 'd you do to him ? ! What 'd you do ? ! Where 'd you put it ? Is this it ? Is this what you used ? Answer me ! [ Straining ] Yes . Anything happens to that kid I 'm going to take you out personally . I don 't care who the hell you are . Here she comes . How is he ? Is he all right ? He 's good . He 's doing fine . Oh , God . Well , can she see him ? We have him in Step Down right now as a precaution but I think he 'll be going home in no time . What did you find ? Nothing . [ Reyes ] How could you find nothing ? There would have to be something . There 's some slight bruising on the head where something clearly broke the skin , but ... he 's fine . What about a tox screen ? There 's an elevated amount of iron in his blood but other than that , your son is completely normal . That doesn 't make sense . No ... I think it does . It makes perfect sense now . I have seen my share of the hideous of the disgusting and the repellent but you , sir are the most perfect expression I will ever see of all that is vile and hateful in life . That may well be but for a moment , you believed it ... that I was him . I never believed it . You wanted to believe . You are as false as your face . I bet you wish night and day that that bullet that was meant to kill you had succeeded . I don 't believe this . What ? Who this is . You 're wrong about that . When I look in the mirror I see something much different than the world sees . He could destroy my face and my dignity when he shot me in that office but he couldn 't destroy the one thing I love most ... my hatred of him . Your cigarette-smoking , son of a bitch of a father . And Mulder 's . You counted on the DNA that we 'd buy it without question and not look any further . DNA 's what Mulder shared with Jeffrey Spender . Ah . Half brothers raised apart ... that 's about all that Mulder and I ever shared . You haven 't seen Mulder , have you ? You haven 't even talked to him . So , getting caught at the FBI ... winning our trust was all towards one thing . It was only to get to William . Sitting here , you 'd wish me dead . Shortly , I 'll do you the favor . I had this checked . It 's an unknown metal that you injected into my son . It 's a form of magnetite . [ Inhales Deeply ] A gift . " A gift " ? Having failed as a conspirator to control alien colonization my father wanted nothing more than to see the world fail too . So , what , you 've prevented it now ? You 've ... prevented alien colonization by injecting this metal into my son ? Your son is the one thing the aliens need . I took revenge on my father by taking William away from them . So , he 's all right now ? I mean , just like that ? So it 's over . They 'll let him be . It 'll never be over . They 'll always know what he was . They 'll never accept what he is . Well , I can protect him . And if you can 't ? Look at me what they did . Is this what you want for your son ? Dana ... the room 's all fresh for you . I threw out all the old bedding and bought some brand-new stuff , okay ? Thank you . I know it 's impossible to stop thinking about what he said about William ... but it 's all lies , Dana and you were the one who proved it . And how should I prove it now ? By insisting that I can protect him only to learn too late that I can 't ? You say it as if you have a choice . He didn 't have a choice to come into this life . I don 't have a choice about what he is or was but I do have a choice about the life my son will have ... [ Voice Breaking ] ... and shouldn 't I choose that he never have to be afraid of anyone or anything ? And can I ever really even promise him that ? But who can ? - [ Crying ] - ? Hallelujah ... ? ? Chills the body but not the soul ? ? Hallelujah ? ? Michael , row the boat ashore ? ? Hallelujah ? ? Michael , row the boat ashore ? - [ Singing ] - ? Hallelujah ? - ? Sister , help to trim the sail ? ... in there . - ? Hallelujah ? - Look what I got . Big buffalo . [ Laughing ] ? Sister , help to trim the sail ? ? Hallelujah ? ? Michael , row the boat ashore ? ? Hallelujah ? - Sweet dreams , baby boy . - ? Michael , row the boat ashore ? ? Hallelujah ? ? Jordan River is deep and wide ? ? Hallelujah ? ? Milk and honey on the other side , hallelujah . ? [ Child ] I made this . !

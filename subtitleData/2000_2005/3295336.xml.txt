 You know , it 's easier to make 100,000 believe than just one ? And now , the one , the only ... Simone ! I love you L.A. It 's great to be here . , ' Looking out on the morning rain , ' , ' I used to feel so inspired , ' , ' And when I knew I had to face another day , ' , ' Lord , it made me feel so tired , ' , ' Before the day I met you , ' , ' Life was so unkind , ' , ' But you 're the key to my peace of mind , ' , ' ' Cause you make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' Like a natural woman , ' , ' Oh , baby , what you 've done to me , ' , ' Done to me , ' , ' You made me feel so good inside , ' , ' Good inside , ' , ' And I just wanna be , ' , ' Wanna be , ' , ' Close to you , you make me feel so alive , ' , ' ' Cause you make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' Like a natural woman , ' , ' You make me feel , ' - , ' You make me feel , ' - , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel like a real ... , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' Feel like a ... , ' , ' You make me feel like a real ... , ' Thank you . Never stop believing . Yeah ! Simone ! , ' What you 've done to me ... , ' , ' Natural woman . , ' I said I didn 't want to be disturbed ! Viktor . My two favourite girls in all the world . - We stopped by to congratulate Simone . - Well , you know ... she 's lying down . She 's exhausted . Yeah , I can imagine . Listen , thank Simone for the tickets , okay ? That 's a good colour on you . It was a great show , Dad . I can 't believe she 's doing this . Taking advantage of him this way . - It 's cruel . - Why ? Obviously , this can 't last . She 's gonna dump him . Viktor won 't be able to take that , he 's too sensitive . This 'll destroy him . Elaine , do you realise that you can 't stop talking about Viktor ? I have to talk to her . I 've been meaning to talk to you . Elaine , I 'm starting to feel like I don 't exist . Dad ? Oh , hi , baby . Thank you . So how 's your love life ? I do okay . What about you ? Well , you know me . Married to my work . I noticed . You know I don 't like to get between you and Mum , but she 's feeling down right now . She broke up with Kent . She thinks you 're with Simone . Ah , Lainey . That 's so ridiculous . I don 't have a relationship with Simone . I know , but Mum doesn 't . Maybe if Simone spoke to her she could straighten things out . Dinner maybe . Dinner ? I don 't know about dinner . That 'd be difficult , I think . - Maybe a phone call ? - It 's too impersonal . They have to meet face-to-face . Well , I 'll think of something . The escalating violence , tragic loss of human life , and threat of all-out war was overshadowed today by the announcement of the Oscar nominations . - Hello ? - Hello ? - Is this Elaine ? - Who 's this ? - My God . Is that you , Simone ? - Yes . - You look beautiful today . - Thanks , I ... - Where are you ? - I 'm right here ... beside you . - Oh ! - I borrowed Viktor 's car . - Hi ! - Hi . I 'm really late . I would love to talk to you , but I 'm on my way to see Viktor right now . Simone , I know what 's going on between you two . Oh ? No . Oh , Elaine , there 's absolutely nothing . It 's strictly a working relationship . I just don 't want to see Viktor get hurt . Sounds to me like you still have feelings for him . Well , we have a daughter together . I don 't love Viktor . I could never love anyone . I 'm in love with the camera . Simone , I recognise the coat you 're wearing . I gave it to Viktor on his birthday . Oh , Christ . Elaine , I just ... Whoa ! God ! Oh my God ! I tell ya . - Are you alright ? - This does look awful . I know that . But , Viktor , he 's just so crazy about you . - Could you go to the Oscars with him ? - No , no , no . If you won 't do it for him , I ask you , please , do it for me . Okay , okay . For you . For you I 'll go . Thank you . Well , here 's my exit . Alright , I 'm glad that we talked . - Oh , yes . Bye . - Bye ! Goodbye . Oh ! And the winner of ' Best Actress ' ... is ... oh my goodness . We have a tie . The winners are Simone for ' Sunrise , Sunset ' ... Thank you . ... and Simone for ' Eternity Forever . ' Unfortunately , Simone cannot be with us here tonight , but thanks to the miracle of modern technology , she joins us live from her goodwill tour of the Third World . Ladies and gentlemen ... Simone ! Thank you . Oh , thank you . This means so much to me . I 'm just sorry I couldn 't be there with you . First , I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees . I don 't even feel I belong in the ' Best Actress ' category , let alone with these wonderful human beings . And I also want to thank my co-stars and the studio , of course . And as always , I dedicate this to Hank , without whom none of this would be possible . I love you , Hank , wherever you are . Thank you . Who 's Hank ? Her agent ? - Her father . - Oh . Why didn 't she thank you ? She did . Didn 't she ? No . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . Why didn 't I say it ? How could I forget to say it ? I wrote it . And of course , I must thank my collaborator , Viktor Taransky , without whom none of this would be possible . Excuse me , Mr Taransky , are you ready for your casting session ? Nicola is here for the role of Simone 's sister . Viktor . So much has happened since we last saw each other . Oh , yeah . Yeah . - Why don 't you sit ? - Thank you . I never got a chance to properly apologise for what happened on ' Sunrise . ' Oh , that 's okay . I know . I understand . When I saw what Simone did with the role , I mean , I fired all my people . I went into rehab . I took some acting classes . I changed my whole look . She really , really inspired me . Would you like me to read ? Oh , sure . That would be good . 'Who do you think you are , Carlos , coming in here like this ? My husband 's sleeping in the next room . You think I won 't call out ? Do you think I 'll just ... give in to you without a fight , like I did the last time and the time before that ? I wish you were dead . I wish we were both dead . ' Oh ... that was just wonderful . Wonderful acting . Thank you . You could play the lead . Isn 't that Simone 's part ? Of course . Of course it is . You have such a beautiful line , right , right there . It 's not a wrinkle , or anything , it 's like a dimple . Right when you smile , it ... I was thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone . Cosmetically altering Simone to look like me ? Oh , yeah . That would be crazy . That would be crazy . Yes ... that would be nuts . Would you like me to try something different with this , or do it again ? No , it 's fine . Okay . Thank you . Thank you , Viktor . Happy birthday , Lainey . What do you think ? It 's fantastic . It 's what she drove in ' Eternity Forever . ' - I know . - See ? - You have to thank her for me . - It 's from both of us . You know , you won 't be able to drive it till you get your permit , but you can take it around the lot , okay ? Here . What 's the matter ? I can 't accept it . Why ? Why , honey ? I don 't want a car , Dad . What do you want ? I 'll give you whatever you want . The old Viktor Taransky . I can 't stand to see you like this ... clinging to Simone 's coattails . It used to be all about the work and now it 's all about her . And then she 's not even grateful enough to thank you . Oh , no , that was me . There you go again , blaming yourself . Can 't you see what she 's done to you ? She 's taking advantage . Mocking you . You deserve better than Simone . - I have to go , Dad . - Okay . Oh , sure . She comes in all the time . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . - Is she nice ? - We 've become very close . She told me she wanted to look at my script next week . - Jane ? - Got to go . I 'm leaving early . If anybody needs me , I 'll be at the beach house having dinner with a certain someone . Elaine Christian , please . Elaine . Hi . Hi . I was in the neighbourhood . I just thought I 'd drop by . You don 't use the front door anymore ? Uh ... no . When is she coming over ? - About now . - Oh . Okay . I 'll just stay until she gets here . Well , she 's ... already here . What ? Elaine ... Simone is not coming over tonight or any other night . - I want you back , Elaine . - I want you back , too . Oh , Viktor ! Wait ! Viktor ! This is crazy . Who are we kidding ? I can 't compete with Simone . - Well ... - What woman can ? I 'd rather have you than Simone . - Believe me . - Oh . That 's so sweet . No , but I can 't let you do that ... make that kind of sacrifice . - No . No . - God , this is strange . You know , I have stabbed people in the back and clawed and slept my way to where I am . - But ... - You have ? Well , it goes with the territory . But for some reason , I can 't betray Simone . I can 't . There 's a goodness to her , Viktor . - No , there 's nothing to her . - Oh , Viktor . You say that now , but in the morning - You would go back to her . - No . No . - You would , Viktor . - She 's gonna retire . - She 'll never work again . - Her public will demand that she does . - Not if I don 't let her . - You ? - Yeah . - How can you stop her ? I 'm gonna tell you a secret now , Elaine . Simone isn 't a real person . I invented her . Every actor is an invention . - Elaine ... - Please . You 're lucky she 's loyal enough to stay with you . Maybe she 's staying out of pity . Who knows ? I mean , she certainly doesn 't need you . Listen , she 's thin air . - She 's pixels . - What ? Computer code moulded by me from a mathematical equation I inherited from a madman . How much have you had to drink ? There is no Simone . - I 'm Simone . - You 're Simone ? I 've done the impossible . I have recreated the infinite nuances of a human being ... a human soul . I have taken nothing , and made it something . I have breathed life into a machine . - I made a miracle . - Viktor , please stop . - Please . - I swear , Elaine . As God is my judge , I swear . I made Simone . I made her . - You made Simone ? - Yes . Viktor ... she made you . You bitch . I 'll destroy you . Bravo ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Had a rough night ? Let 's see if they still love you after this . You made me ? I made you first . Well , we 're back on ' Good Morning , Good Day , ' and we are here once again with the incomparable Simone . Simone , before the break you were taking a rather controversial position . I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range . How else can the children learn to defend themselves ? If there is a hole in the ozone layer , how come I can 't see it ? Immigration ? God ! Isn 't it crowded enough ? But God created furry animals to be worn . Have you ever tasted dolphin ? Pan-fried with a little garlic and fennel ? Everybody always talks about the negatives of cigarettes . But look at the benefits . I mean , you don 't eat as much . And you 've got something to hold in your hand . We always knew Simone wasn 't like other celebrities . - Oh , no . - She speaks her mind . She certainly does . It 's plastic , Hank . I know that 's the way you 'd want it . She killed you , Hank . Now she 's killing me . She 's a serial killer . But I don 't know how to stop her . I mean , she 's taken on a life of her own . I can 't just come clean ... you know , make some confession ... because ... I 've defrauded millions . They 'd turn on me . I just can 't put the genie back in the bottle , because ... if she suddenly stopped working , you know , just dropped out of sight , they 'd never let it rest . I tried killing her career ... but they like her even more . What am I gonna do ? Not another word , Hank . You are truly a genius . Thank you , Hank . Thank you . What 's the matter , Viktor ? You look so sad . Don 't you love me anymore ? It 's over , isn 't it ? I know what you 're thinking , Simone . This is a phoney-baloney world . We 're all living one big lie , so , why shouldn 't you live , too ? You 're more authentic than all these people who worship you . And that 's the problem . You 're looking at the real fraud . I told myself this was all about the work . But if that were the truth , it wouldn 't matter to me that you get all the attention . And it does . It does . I 'm sorry , Simone . Here I was trying to convince the whole world you existed . But what I was really trying to do was convince them that I exist . It 's not that you aren 't human ... It 's that I am . I 'm sorry , Simone . It is my sad ... and solemn duty ... to announce ... the tragic passing of Simone . How did she die ? It was a rare virus she contracted on her goodwill tour of the Third World . Did she suffer ? Mercifully , it was quick . I feel awful . It 's a great loss . You know , we 're going to have to restructure your deal . Can I see you later ? I mean , go away for the weekend ? How could you bring that up at a time like this ? One minute , Mr Taransky . Oh my God . This has got to be a mistake . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . - You don 't understand . - Viktor ! - It 's a mistake ! - I 'll call my attorney . Dad ! Elaine , call Bernard ! That 's why it was so light . I heard him say , 'Die , bitch . I 'll destroy you . ' It was so strange . He actually wanted to replace Simone with me in his new movie . He 's a sick man . He was a controlling madman . She was a prisoner . I blame myself . I wish I had done more to stop him . Forgive me , Mr Taransky . I 'm just trying to understand here . Now , all these films and TV appearances and magazine covers and Internet interviews , publicity photos , snapshots from her childhood ... all fake ? Hmm ? This is fake ? This is fake ? Fake , fake , fake , fake , fake . - All fake ? - Yes . You understand perfectly . So I will confess ... to fraud , but not to murder . And a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions , that 's also bogus ? No . No . The fan club 's real . It 's just what they were worshipping is a computer code . Ones and zeroes . You couldn 't have killed Simone because there was no Simone . - Right . Exactly . - And this ' Hank Aleno' that you keep talking about , renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead . Now , perhaps this man that you claim helped invent Simone , is an invention himself . Oh , no . No . This whole thing is insane ! There is no Simone ! Look ... even her name is fake . It 's not Simone . It 's ' Sim one ' ... see ? 'Simulation one ' ! It 's a computer code ! You really hated her , didn 't you ? Perhaps you could explain this to me , Mr Taransky . Or is this tape doctored , too ? This is footage from the marina 's closed-circuit camera on the night in question ... altered of course . Can you tell us why you 're disposing of the body of a woman who doesn 't exist ? Well , it 's not her body . It 's her body ... of work . Viktor , Viktor , Viktor . Viktor , I know . Look . Look . Look . Why don 't you just come clean ? Huh ? Just tell the truth , you 're gonna feel better afterwards . I 'm telling the truth , and I don 't feel so good . Hey , we all know what happened . In a fit of jealous rage , you killed Simone and you dumped her body off the boat ... - Don 't say that . ... that she bought for you . I did ... I can prove ... I can prove it to you . Let me just take you there . I 'll take you to the spot . I can prove it . Here . Here . Come on . We can just go there , can 't we ? - Let 's go . I 'll take you there . - Oh , Viktor . Okay , good . Thank you . Good work . Now you 'll see . What is this ? No , there 's drives and discs . Where are the discs ? You have to go back down and get them . - That 's where they are . - We can 't go back down there . - There 's discs down there ! - Calm yourself ! - Please ! - Sit him down . You must go down and get the drives . Hey , you see what 's down there ? Plead guilty . Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court . It 's the best deal you 're gonna get . I could get the death penalty . Yeah . Yeah . You certainly will if you go to trial . A jury , in this kind of ugly mood ... you killed an icon , for God 's sake . - Bernard , listen to me ! - Viktor ! Bernard , I didn 't kill anyone . Viktor , come on , it 's in the paper . There 's no one to kill . Bernard , I 'm a filmmaker . I was trying to say something . I wanted recognition . I wanted to be appreciated ... so I created her . Bernard , there 's no one to kill . Do you understand ? An insanity defence . Beautiful . Fantastic . - What are you doing ? - ' I created her . ' Viktor ! Jesus ! Jesus Christ , Viktor ! What am I doing ? Oh , what am I doing ? - Get me out ! - Viktor ! Get me another lawyer . I want another lawyer ! Why can 't people just take responsibility for their actions anymore , huh ? You know , I can almost forgive him for killing her . But to deny her existence ? I can never forgive that . Because obviously she existed , right ? I know it just as surely as you 're sitting there . She was the most vital woman I ever met . So you did meet her ? Yeah ... Lainey , what are you getting at ? I 'm the head of a major studio . Do you think I 'm gonna make a three-picture deal with an actress I never met ? No . No . I mean , really meet her ... like in the flesh ? I know it 's embarrassing to admit it , Mum , but when I think about it honestly , I haven 't . I 've never really seen Simone up close ... touched her . Been in her physical presence . Have you ? We don 't want to believe Daddy because we don 't want to believe that we were taken in too . But , Lainey ... there 's no evidence that Simone isn 't real . Listen to what you 're saying , Mum . I mean , is there any evidence that she is ? Do you have any idea what you 're doing ? - What 's that ? - Part of Dad 's story may be true . Simone may have contracted a virus . Certain viruses can be cured . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Listen to me . There 's a psychiatrist in Ventura , well-respected , who is willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity ... due to the trauma of your divorce , 10 years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child . No more . I can 't go along with this horseshit . - Come on , Viktor . - I did it . No . No . Viktor , come on . - Tell them they can fry me . - No , Viktor , please . - I did it ! - Viktor , please . It was premeditated ! - Can you please lower your voice ? - I strangled her ... I bludgeoned her ... I set her on fire , and then I killed her ! - I did it ! - Excuse me . I think you better see this . Breaking news ... international media star Simone is alive and well . Her studio released this footage , just minutes ago . Simone reading today 's edition of ' The LA Times . ' Who says the only bad publicity is your obituary ? Details at the top of the hour . She 's indestructible . He 's coming . Viktor . Oh , Viktor . Oh , honey . I don 't know what you did or how you did it , - But thank you . - Well , it was Lainey . But don 't thank us too fast . You know what we have to do now ? What ? Well , why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast ? You have to finish what you started . We can do it together . - Haven 't we done enough ? - Could we go , please ? Where are we going ? Well , I was thinking ... how about you and Simone , moving in with me and Lainey ? That 's wonderful . - What do you think , Lainey ? - About you and Mum ? Well , about me and Simone ... what I did ... everything . I 'm sorry . Your mistake wasn 't making something fake , Dad . We 're fine with fake ... as long as you don 't lie about it . Oh , come on , Viktor . It 's not a death sentence . No . It 's life . Hey , Viktor , remember us ? We probably never met . I 'm Milton . How are you ? Max Sayer from ' The Echo . ' - Hi ! - It 's life . Just call . Five minutes . All we need is five minutes . Good evening , and welcome . Simone , the question on everybody 's mind is simply ... ' Why ? ' Frank , you know as well as I do , living in this fish bowl ... the insatiable appetite of the media ... with everything that was going on in my life , I just needed to drop out of sight for a while . I needed time , and Viktor bought me that time . - I owe him so much . - We all do . But now I understand you 're eager to get back to work , and it 's not the kind of work we were all expecting . It 's true . I can reveal I am considering a career in politics . And what , may I ask , brought this on ? I suppose this little man had something to do with it . - That beautiful baby ? - Yes . You see , Viktor and I are both very concerned about what kind of world our new son , ' Chip , ' is going to grow up in . Aren 't you , Viktor ? Oh , yes . Hi . Oh yes . , ' Looking out on the morning rain , ' , ' I used to feel so inspired , ' , ' And when I knew I had to face another day , ' , ' Lord , it made me feel so tired , ' , ' Before the day I met you , ' , ' Life was so unkind , ' , ' You 're the key to my peace of mind , ' , ' ' Cause you make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel like a natural woman , ' , ' When my soul was in the lost and found , ' , ' You came along to claim it , ' , ' I didn 't know what was wrong with me , ' , ' Till your kiss helped me name it , ' , ' Now I 'm no longer doubtful to what I 'm living for , ' , ' And if I make you happy , I don 't need to do more , ' , ' ' Cause you make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel like a natural woman , ' , ' Woman , ' , ' Oh , baby , what you 've done to me , ' , ' Done to me , ' , ' You made me feel so good inside , ' , ' Good inside , ' , ' And I just wanna be , ' , ' Wanna be , ' , ' Close to you , you make me feel so alive , ' , ' ' Cause you make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel like a natural woman , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' You make me feel like a real ... , ' , ' You make me feel , ' , ' Feel like I 'm real ... , ' , ' You make me feel like a real ... , ' She likes chicken pot pie ... just like me .

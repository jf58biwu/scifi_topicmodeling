 We saw the Earth destroyed . And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . You 're a fucking liar . This is your fault . You and your fucking secrets got Mom killed and you know it . You 're a fucking liar . Your only interest in your sons is how they reflect on you . You never cared about anybody but yourself . You and your fucking secret got Mom killed and you know it . Commander Taggart , we 're with the FBI . We 're here to ask you a few questions . I can 't box all this up neatly for you , even though I know y 'all want me to . You want a motive about why a woman wakes up one day ... takes a gun , tries to shoot somebody she never even met ? Well , so do I. Sir , your wife passed from heart failure on the floor of the Civic Centre . And we found no medical information to reveal a terminal condition . Did she ever mention to you any physical ailment or apprehension ? That would justify why she just had nothing to lose ... and go shoot somebody in the head ? - Perhaps . - My wife was strong as an ox ... and we screwed like ducks right up to the day she died . Did she have something against Senator Perry ? - She didn 't even vote . - Were you having any marital difficulties ? I buried my wife three months away from our 25th wedding anniversary . You don 't live for 25 years with somebody without having some kind of difficulties . She was approaching middle age ... she had two young sons who were cutting the apron strings . I was hardly around . If she was flipping out about all of that , she wasn 't telling me . Can you tell us about your relationship with Senator Perry 's daughter ? - She 's an excellent pilot . - No other connection ? Nope . Could your wife have thought differently , sir ? - No . - But isn 't it true ... that when Angela Perry experienced severe disorientation during a routine space walk ... you were the one who talked her down ? So what ? I 'm her CO , for Christ 's sakes . - You trying to read something into that ? - I 'm finding it noteworthy , sir . Well , you take all the goddamned notes you want , but you run that one down ... you won 't find shit , madam . Now , my wife was a good woman ... but I ain 't got one clue about why she did what she did . If you all find one , why don 't you come back here and tell me ? Meantime , why don 't we just let her rest in peace ? Who 's that ? That was the FBI in peace and war . - What did they want ? - Blame , Son . They want to blame somebody . I 'm gonna go down to the sub shop on Robinson . You want anything ? Nope . I 'm going to pack . - Where are you going ? - Out of here , man . - For how long ? - I don 't know . - Are you gonna call ? - Eventually . You know , you don 't have to be so fucking cold . Excuse me ? I know you 're checking out . You don 't have to throw it in my face . Son , I don 't have a clue as to what you 're saying . But then again , you probably don 't either . - Well , you 're just running away . - Am I ? - Why don 't you answer the phone ? - Get it yourself . Day 35 , 7 : 30 a.m. The chemical medium has remained stable for the past 36 hours . There has been no further depletion of aluminium ... ferrous sulphate , manganese and other essential micronutrients . These findings are consistent with the ultrasonic imaging ... that depicts advanced tissue scaffolding . The pseudo bone and cranial structure are at the developmental stage ... roughly commensurate with that of a juvenile human . The specimen has completed a radical growth spurt . It has tripled its mass in the past 24 hours . In order to determine viability outside of the growth medium ... it will soon be necessary to drain the tank . It appears I 've been spared the effort . There 's something I need to tell you . You know , I love the way you act like we 've known each other for years . - I feel that way , too . - Okay . So what 's news ? What , I 'm fired ? No , no . It 's personal . It 's about me and Cheryl . - I broke off the engagement . - God , Troy . I realised that if I have feelings for you or for anybody else ... - then it wasn 't right with Cheryl . - No . But it 's the timing . - It 's my fault . - It 's not anyone 's fault . - It is not supposed to happen this way . - How do you know ? How is Cheryl taking this ? She 's angry , but she 's not devastated . She 's finished with me . She wants a guy who 's obsessed with her . Like I 'm obsessed with you . - You make it so hard to do the right thing . - This is the right thing . You know it . I know you know that . I can see it in your eyes . Just say you 'll have dinner with me . That 's all I 'm asking . I have to think about it . Come on , Kurt , let 's go ! I hope he has something to eat . Yeah . I 'm down to cornflakes and PowerBars . How you doing , honey ? - How 's your dad ? - Don 't ask . - Hi . Hi . Come in . - Yeah . Quick , quick , quick . Okay . All right . Now look . Where 's your gun ? Didn 't you bring your gun ? - My gun ? - Yes . Did you bring your gun ? - What is that ? - That ? Well , that 's a kubikiri . It 's a Japanese ceremonial sword . It literally means " head-cutter . " Right . - Literally means " head-cutter . " - Kurt , what 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? Frankly , I don 't know where to start , frankly . Why don 't you start with putting down the sword ? No , no . That baby stays right here . You never know . You know , not good . - Why don 't you tell us what happened ? - Right . What happened , what happened . Well , I never dreamt it could be functional . Never . I never dreamt ... What ? I think it 's dangerous . I think it 's dangerous . - What is , Kurt ? - Oh , Christ . Well , there 's no easy way to say . It 's not easy to say ... - Well , Kurt , then spit it out , man . - Right . I grew a Synthetic ... That 's a terrible year . Thanks a lot . Hey , mister , you wouldn 't be headed to Denton , would you ? You 're barking around the wrong dog , sweetie . A simple no would suffice . Thank you . - What do you think ? - Sure , darling . No problem . Honey , what 'd I tell you about talking to strangers ? What ? - That 's my daughter you 're talking to , son . - Don 't listen to him , okay ? She 's been giving me some lip , but she 's still my legal responsibility ... so I think you just better walk on . - Hey , wait , wait ! He 's lying ! - Take your money back . - What the hell was that for ? - Consider yourself lucky . You 're just gonna leave me stranded here . - Hey , I am talking to you ! - Well , I ain 't listening . You cost me a ride . You can 't just drive off and leave me . Get in . Son of a bitch . I thought I 'd seen every part of Kurt 's dark side . Silly me . - Careful with that . - I know what I 'm doing . Jesus , it 's a goddamn Synth tank . Angela , what are you doing ? There 's nothing in here . You think he 's telling the truth ? Here , stay with me . Aye-aye , " Chuck . " All right , hold this . Looks like Kurt kept a journal . Electron-microscope analysis suggests that ... the internal structure of synthetic tissue closely mimics that of organics . I believe that the Synthetic growth medium uses human DNA as a model . Therefore , I propose to introduce human DNA to the matrix ... and monitor the reactions . Holy shit . He put someone 's DNA into that Synth . - What would that do ? - I have no idea . You should have told us what you were doing . - I couldn 't . I couldn 't . - Okay . Answer me this , Kurt . Kurt ? Don 't you think there 's enough pressure on us already ? Aren 't there enough Synthetics out there to fuck this up ? Why the hell do you feel the need to add to the mix ? Hey , don 't swear , Sarah . That doesn 't become you . Social grace is not exactly on the forefront of my fucking mind right now , Kurt . Right , right , I suppose not . I 'm sorry . What in God 's name were you trying to accomplish ? - I never do anything in God 's name , Sarah . - Yeah ? No shit ? No shit . I wanted to find ... I was searching for answers . - By creating a Synth ? - Hey , hey . Here , here . We are fighting ... We 're fighting an enemy that we don 't understand . Anyone with any experience in combat would tell you ... that that is a first-class recipe for failure . And the primary rule of war , " Know your enemy . " Okay . Why don 't I believe that ? Why do I believe you were just trying to play God ? God , God . You have God on your brain . Always , always have , always will . Yeah . Thank God for that . If Chuck finds out what you did , he 's gonna kill you . And now you wonder why I had to keep it a secret . Hello ? Angela , hey . Oh , Jesus . Did you find anything else ? All right , I 'll see you when you get back here . - That was Angela . - Was it ? Yeah . They went through your lab . You know that thing that you made ? It 's gone . I just wish I knew whether that was good news or bad . That makes two of us . Hey ! Hey , what are you doing ? Just get the ... Hey . Hey , bro . Danny ! Oh , shit . I just keep wishing that I could wake up ... like when you was a little kid and you had a bad dream . - I 'm sorry about your friend . - It just don 't make sense . I mean , that guy ... That weasel , he jumped Danny , he was small . I got a 10-year-old nephew bigger than him . I don 't get how he done so much damage . Can you tell me anything else about what he looked like ? He was all hunched over , just stooped over , like . And white . And he had like veins or something spread out all over him . Reminded me of a newborn fresh out of the womb . And his left hand , it was like messed up . Messed up how ? Can you describe it ? It was like ... It was deformed , like a flipper or something . The EEG and blood flow tests are all in agreement . Patient 's brain-dead . The detective I spoke to said there were no visible marks on his body . That 's right . - They talk about the 5-HT tests ? - No . Serum analysis indicates that the patient had abnormally low levels of 5-HT . - What ? - That 's serotonin in the brain . Serotonin . Isn 't that related to depression ? Well , serotonin is a neurotransmitter . It sends messages between adjacent brain cells . Serotonin deficiency has been linked to various mental disorders ... like depression , or schizophrenia , or paranoid delusions . Does this guy have a history of mental illness ? Not according to the family history . Or at least , not from the records provided by his wife . - Is that her ? - She 's facing a tough decision . The condition of her husband 's body makes him an ideal organ donor ... but she 'd have to take him off life support . And how do you do it when your loved one 's still breathing ... and their skin is warm to the touch ? Yeah . That 's a horrible place to be . All right , so this entry is from about a month ago . It 's during its early developmental stage and you 're talking about ... the capacity of the Synthetic brain to comprehend its environment . You wanna elaborate on that ? Elaborate ? What does it matter ? I 'm not a fucking neurologist . It matters because I 'm trying to figure out what this thing knows ... what it wants , so that we can catch it . This is your baby , Kurt . Do you know ? Kurt , you gotta get your shit together , man . It wants what we all want . To think . Think better . To think better . To think better . What does that mean ? Kurt , for Christ 's sake , pull it together . - It 's true , Neil . - Kurt ? Wait , wait . I know what you want . In the video library . Rewind to ... Rewind to July . That 's it . July . July 4 . July 4 . That 's it . - July . - July 4 . Okay . July 4 . Okay . No . I 'm not seeing an entry for July 4 . Oh , that 's right . I forgot . July 4 , national holiday . I took the day off . There 's a whole hell of a lot of riffraff on the highway . You realise how dangerous it is to hitchhike ? You know how bad it is for you to smoke those things ? - Am I bothering you ? - Yes . In fact , you are . Well , honey , you can get all the fresh air you want , walking your ass to Denton . Hey . Oh , baby , I bet you just got a passel of cowboys ... standing in line , waiting to kiss the ground you walk on . Only one . And he better , seeing as I grabbed the first train out of Tucson ... taking me 300 miles out of my way to San Antonio . And now I gotta risk my life hitching all the way to Denton for him . You going to Denton for a guy ? We met at the Denton train station a year ago today . I was starting my freshman year at North Texas State ... - and he was coming home . - Coming home from what ? The Boy Scouts ? Rotation at Randolph Air Force Base . Air Force base . What is he , a military boy ? - A jet pilot . - A hotshot . - Nothing sexier . - Really ? In honour of our first anniversary of being in love ... we 're meeting at the train station and we 're getting married . - First love ? - First and last . Honey , those flyboys are going around the world half the time ... buzzing all over hell and gone , and never see their wife and kids . Why in God 's name do you wanna throw your life away on a flyboy ? You 'd understand if you met him . You 're just one more pretty little girl who fell for one more uniformed boy ... with the balls enough to throw you a smile . You have never seen anything like him . He 's gonna be a superstar . A superstar . Wow . That 's when I ... Quick , quick , it 's Neil . He 's hurt . Quick . - Oh , my God . - Wait , wait . Neil , yeah . - Kurt , what ... - You gotta help me out , yes . All right . All right , start talking now . - Don 't move . - What did you do to him ? Not half of what I 'm gonna do to you if you don 't tell me what I need to know . Listen to me . It 's your Synthetic . It 's attacked someone else down at the dock . The victim 's in the hospital in a coma , suffering from massive serotonin depletion . That might not be much of a loss for a fucking longshoreman . Honey , that 's what happened to you . Your Synthetic sucked out your serotonin . - Say that three times fast . - Kurt , come on . You know what low serotonin levels can do . Oh , yeah , I know what it means . It means my mind is stalled by the side of the road , waiting for a tow truck . Maybe I 'll let my little sidekick do my thinking for me . Do you know what that means ? It means that you 're busted . - That 's what it means . - We 're registering as warm-blooded , Kurt . So whatever you 're seeing is a symptom of the serotonin depletion . Yeah , but , well , we 're gonna see three dead Synths ... if you don 't take me to your better halves . That 's Sarah , Neil , and Angela . That 's the human ones , that is . We are human , Kurt . It 's us ! Where the fuck are my friends ? Or the next one goes through his head . - All right , watch this Synthetic ... - Kurt ! Wait , no ! Okay . - You 're right . We are Synthetic . - Angela ! He knows , and we 're not gonna change his mind . I can take you to your friends . And we don 't wanna hurt you or them . So what do you want ? What do you want ? We want that Synthetic you created . How do I know you 're not lying about my friends ? How do I know they 're not already dead ? Do you wanna call them ? - Call them ? - You can speak to them . - On the phone ? - Yeah . All right . Yeah , so , what 's the number ? 2-3-1 ... 2-3 ... - Neil . - No ! - Neil ! - No ! - It 's just a flesh wound . - That was really stupid . You could have killed yourself , or him , or us . Yeah ? Well , he 's not waving a gun around in your face anymore , now is he ? - Well , we can 't afford to take stupid risks . - Hey , it was my call , Angela . No , it wasn 't . Could you stop trying to be my commander ? - I outrank you . - This isn 't the Air Force . Go , go . Bravo , bravo , bravo . I applaud the performance , but I 'm not buying it . - Buying what ? - The simulated internal conflict . Nice touch , but it won 't convince me that you 're anything but poorly-made simulacra . And anyway , the real Angela is about five pounds thinner . 5-HTP . - 5-HTP , what 's that ? - Yeah . X-fiends use it after raves . It increases serotonin levels . It 's very safe . You can get it at any drugstore . Now listen , you grew a Synthetic , but something went wrong in the process ... and you 've created some kind of mutant Synth that seems to feed off serotonin . It attacked you , and that attack has left you delusional . Yeah . No , Kurt , listen . It 's killing people , so we have to stop it . Oh , God ! So why didn 't it kill me ? Well , maybe it was smaller and it didn 't need as much serotonin . - Maybe it hadn 't perfected its method yet . - Okay . Open up . We 're gonna stop this little paranoid delusional ... - Aggressive , anti-social ... - Homicidal . - All right . - Nasty little bugger . Hey , open your goddamn mouth . Swallow it . Oh , that 's it . Sarah and Angela and Neil are smarter than you think . - They have training . - Oh , really ? Yeah , professional combat training . - Is that counting my 5th grade karate class ? - And my Tae Bo seminar ? Yeah . They have professional training . Professional combat training . Here you go . - I will do it , Kurt . - Oh , God . You 're not a Synthetic . You are a ball-buster . You are ... Drink . - Hey , what 're you doing ... I got you ! - No way ! You missed me by a mile ! - Did not ! - Did so ! Got you that time . - Another attack at the docks ? - Teenage boy . He 's critical . Call his parents . They might agree to go on camera . Wait a minute . What happened to him ? No word . But you have to do it today . If this story goes national , next thing you know ... Connie Chung is sending fruit baskets . We don 't stand a chance anyway . Listen , I just need to know one thing , Chad , okay ? Is this the same MO as that longshoreman ? They 're saying maybe . Are you gonna make the call ? Yeah . Fine . So , you 're on top of that dock story ? Yeah . I 'm calling the parents right now . Did you think about dinner ? - Yes . - And ? And ... we should take this slow . Life is uncertain . You could be swept off your feet by another man . - Then we 'd have missed our chance . - It 'll be worth the wait . Saturday night , 8 : 00 . - Yeah . I 'll pencil that in . - Good , good . I spoke to the doctor . The latest victim is alive , but in a deep coma . The Synth seems to concentrate its hunt down at the harbour front . Maybe we should go after it there . Yeah , since we 're all professionally trained in combat . Well , you got a better idea ? All right . So how would we find it down there ? The docks are huge . The same way fishermen chum for sharks . - Okay . - You wanna elaborate ? I think your little antidote has had some results . So you 're normal and we 're not Synthetic ? Yes , you 're not Synthetic , and no , I don 't think I 'll ever be normal . Well , how about this ? Since we 're not Synthetic and we are ourselves ... and we are the only people on the planet you can trust ... - you can just tell us . - Fair enough . This thing needs serotonin . Which is the difficulty , since it 's only found in the human brain . No , not necessarily . That thing you gave me ... Those pills you gave me , the 5-HTP ... they 're actually a form of synthetic serotonin . So what do we do with it ? Maybe we could liquefy it and then cover somebody with it and use him as bait . - Who do you have in mind ? - Well , yours truly , of course . Why you ? Because thanks to me , one person is brain-dead and the other one is not far off . Wanna cut me loose now ? You told your folks yet about this rendezvous with your superstar ? Nope . You 're not gonna tell them about your big plan ? Yeah . As soon as it 's legal . I 'll wager your folks don 't approve of this hotshot . Now , you wanna start off a marriage like that ? - They just got a bug up their ass . - Both of them ? Well , my dad . Oh , honey , you 're looking down 50 miles of bad road with your folks . How do you know so much , anyhow ? Do I remotely resemble someone to you who has never been through this horseshit ? Look , I know you 're older than me , but if you call this horseshit ... you can just let me out right here . So what 's the bug up your dad 's ass ? I don 't know . I 'm too young , he 's too whatever . - Wild . - Not exactly . Well , I mean , he does fly jets ... which sort of scares my dad , and me . He 's just ... He has his own way about things . So your dad is a little bit threatened by flyboy 's big head . I suppose so . Or maybe your dad just doesn 't want nobody sniffing around his little princess . Yeah . That 's a bit right , old man . So other than the usual " young love " goodies ... what 's your flyboy do to make you so happy ? He treats me like I 'm his queen . So he 's got you on a pedestal . Or maybe it 's vice versa . Maybe you got him on one . A man 'll let you down , you know . - Not all men . - Yeah . Most of them . Flawed creatures , men . Selfish , stupid , and they 're petty and they 're pig-headed . Well , then you 're talking about women , too . You 're talking about everyone . We 're all flawed creatures . Am I supposed to sit on my butt at home listening to my father ... " Do nothing , because humanity is flawed " ... and I might step in some crap ? Look , I 'm on my way , mister . I 'm on my way to a train station to meet the man I love ... and I 'm gonna marry him now . You saying I shouldn 't do that ? No . I 'm not . All right . 5-HTP . Don 't leave home without it . Oh , God . I never thought I 'd be human bait for my own brain-sucking Synthetic creation . You volunteered . Man , it 's guilt . And it gets me in trouble every time . Well , here goes nothing . Wish me luck . Bye . See you . Well , we sure have lots of people to choose from . - They 're all human . - Human . Human . So tell me something , Kurt . How did you figure out how to make a Synthetic ? Well , it was trial and error . I used pieces of Tessa , remember ? And body parts from our little friends at the campfire . And I hate to admit it , good old Chuckie , when he was a Synthetic , that is . You tried to grow a Synthetic Chuck ? Terrifying thought , isn 't it ? Anyway , what I discovered is that Synthetic tissue is self-replicating . Find the correct growth medium , it does the work for you . Sentients are all ... At least , this particular Sentient ... seemed to have mastered nanotechnology ... putting it a comfortable 50 years ahead of us . - Well , we got one . Three o 'clock . - He 's coming towards you , to the right . - Too many people . - No , wait , wait , wait . - No , he 's turning away . - Is he on to us ? No . He 's going into a warehouse . - Okay , we 're going after him . Hang tight . - Yeah . Don 't move ! Don 't you move ! Put your hands up and keep them up ! Don 't move . - Angela . - What ? Look at his hand . - Shit . - Maybe he finished forming . How can we know ? Where 's Kurt ? Kurt ? Are you okay ? Kurt . Kurt , are you there ? Kurt , where are you ? Answer me . - Yes . - We 're coming to get you . Now this can 't be a coincidence , can it , my friend ? Now this can 't be a ... Now this can 't be a ... Now this can 't be a coincidence . Oh , shit . Where did I come from ? Who is my creator ? You 're looking right at him . You 're organic . Yes , I know you 're confused . You have a lot of questions ... and I can answer them when I 'm in a safe place . Kurt , where are you ? We got the wrong Synthetic . My friends , they know about you . They 're after you . They know all about you . Then maybe they can answer my questions , my friend . Kurt ! Kurt , we 're in the warehouse . Where are you ? Kurt ! - Hey . - Hey . - We thought we lost you . - No . Yeah , we got sidetracked by the wrong Synthetic . - Did you see anything ? - No , nothing . Hey , are you all right ? I 'm suddenly dizzy , tired . All right , buddy , then let 's get you back , huh ? Are you sure you 're okay ? Maybe it 's a residual high leftover ... - from all that 5-HTP . - Any chance it 'll last ? A well-adjusted Kurt Mendel , that might be a little hard to take . Well , I think our plan was a bust . Well , maybe the Synthetic left the docks to go hunt for more prey . Maybe it wasn 't hunting . What else would it have been doing ? Trying to find its place in the world , how it came to be . That 's almost poetic . Sooner or later , it 's gonna get hungry . Hello ! Help ! So why the serotonin ? Maybe it needs serotonin to maintain its cognitive functions . Oh , Neil , could you get me some aspirin ? I 'm not feeling too well . Sure . Why don 't you sit down and rest for a little bit ? I 'll get some water . 35 cents ? Fucking machine ! Hey , Kurt , I 've been meaning to ask you something . Here you go . In one of your diary entries you mention that ... How synthetic tissue seems to mimic human DNA , and that you were ... going to introduce real human DNA into the growth matrix . - Yes ? - Well , whose DNA did you use ? Hey ! Hey , asshole ! Kurt ? Whose DNA did you use , Kurt ? Mine , of course . Kurt , let me see your left hand . You mean this one . Hey ! Hey , hey ! What are you waiting for ? Shoot him ! Shit ! Goodbye , " Kurt . " How do I look ? Do I look okay ? You look smashing . Makes me wish that I was getting married today . Thanks , old man . Paige ! Don 't you mean Mrs Chuck Taggart ? And what am I gonna do without you now , baby ? What am I gonna do without you now ? - Hello ? - But I thought ... that you were a decent person and I thought that we could be friends . But whatever it is that you think you 're doing is low , Sarah . - He told me you were okay with this . - He would never say that . We 're in love . This is not a cheap affair . We planned a life together . - What do you want me to do ? - I want you to leave him alone ... and I want you to give us a chance , if it 's not too much to ask . No . No , it 's not . Due to a low-grade depression ... my psychiatrist attributed to serotonin deprivation ... I 've been prescribed happy pills . It 's not just because of the serotonin deficiency . Because of me , a stevedore is brain-dead , and there 's that kid , Zack . Chuck would have loved the irony . A scientist 's comeuppance , brought down by his own hubris . So where 's your doppelganger ? It 's all gone . Destroyed by fire . - And we should just believe you . - Yes . You 're the one who speaks so eloquently about the subject of trust , darling . Let 's just hope it doesn 't find a way to come back from the dead . - Well , did you or did you not burn it ? - Yes . Yes . God . But you never know . Nature , Synthetic or not ... can always surprise you by its tenacity . New species often resist dying out . How ? By rising from the ashes ? What , now we have a Lazarus on our hands ? I 'll say a prayer that we don 't . - Bye . - See you . - Bye . - Bye . - Hello . - Hi . Hi . I 'm looking for Zack Ambrose . You know , that teenage boy who 's in a coma . Yes . Hey , Zack . God , you 're so young . Listen to me , Zack . You need to try to get better . I know you can , because I did . And I 'm sure you have a great family who loves you . You know , the world we live in rarely lives up to its potential ... but I know what it 's like when the world isn 't around , and believe me ... from that perspective , things start looking a hell of a lot better . Who are you ? Oh , hi . I 'm Kurt Mendel . I 'm a substitute teacher at Zack 's school . I heard about what happened . I thought I had to come by . Are you Zack 's mother ? Yeah . It 's very nice to meet you . Is there anything I can do ? Do you know how to pray , Mr. Mendel ? Yes . As a matter of fact , I do .

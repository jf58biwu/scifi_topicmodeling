GASPS Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids ? Sorry , Capt. Leela . I guess I 'm just having one of those manic Mondays . laughing This is ancient Earth 's most foolish program . Why does Ross , the largest friend , not simply eat the other five ?

Call me old - fashioned , but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating . ship crying I know. I know . Look , ship . If I learned one thing from my breakup with Shawn that was totally mutual i  s that happiness can only come from within you . But Bender is within me ! There must be some way to make him love me again . Trust me . You can 't change men any more than you can change the laws of time and space . That is so true . RUMBLlNG I may not be able to change the laws of time and space but I know something that can . GRUNTlNG Sweetie ? You see that giant quasar we 're heading into ? You might want to scooch a few parsecs to the left . I 'm afraid I can 't do that , Leela . Wha  s happening ? Space cow ? The ship 's just taking the breakup a little hard . She 's nuts ! In a few moments , the power of 1 0 billion black holes will smoosh Bender and me together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity . screaming You don 't need to kill us , P / anet Ecpress ship . Because I love you ! Yeah , baby ! Feel like doing stuff for you and stuff . Hm. I don 't believe you . If you really wanted to be with me you 'd merge your programming with mine . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Slow down . My friends who 've done that say that afterwards , all the passion went out of their relationship . - l don 't know if you want my opinion- - - Leela . Bender and I really need to be alone , so I 'm turning off the oxygen . coughing AND choking Look , missy . If you don 't turn around now I 'm gonna have to shut down your brain ! Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela . - That barely hurt Leela at all . - Maybe not . But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction ? BENDER : Float for your lives ! This is the one place she can 't hear us . Just pretend to shower . - Same as every day . Got it . - Now here 's the plan . Oh , if only I could read lips . Comprende , Bender ? You 'll have to distract her . Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain . I  s too risky . I 'm a very meek individual . If her personality engulfs mine , the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever . I 'm willing to take that risk . Hey , pookums . Contrary to what I was saying earlier melding minds with you would be extremely bearable . You really mean it ? Uh , yes . BEEPlNG BENDER groaning Huh ? Hey ? Tubes ? You 're older than you said you were ! Come closer , Bender . Le  s become one . I prefer two . That way we can still be a horse for Halloween . WHlMPERS Okay , Bender has her distracted . Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix . Oh. I can 't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face . I 'm on it . Maybe I 'll find those magic words while I 'm at it . LEELA : Fat chance . - Yeah , I know . GROANS - Oh . How about this one ? - Give it up , Fry ! I 've got to pop these tops in a precise order . Halfway there . The ship should be getting a bit less rational now . - Me want engulf Bender ! BENDER : No ! I didn 't do it ! Only a few more . Hey , I won free admission to Six Flags ! Just one more reason we must survive this . - Leela ? - Fry , I 'll read your candy later . When we 're not dead ! BEEPlNG - What was that ? - Oh , nothing .

Bender , are you okay ? What crazy thing am I gonna date next ? It sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers . Of course . Bender is a lone wolf . A solitary eagle . FEMALE v oice : A cuddly baby tapir . BENDER 'S v oice : And tha  s why I love him . I guess we 'd better clean up these millions of hearts . No. I 've got a lazier idea . ZOlDBERG : As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar a wondrous thing happened , why not ? They vaporized into a mystica / / ove radiation that spread across the universe , destroying many , many p / anets inc / uding two gangster p / anets and a cowboy wor / d . But one p / anet was ecact / y the right distance to see the romantic rays but not be destroyed by them . Earth . so a / / over the wor / d , coup / es stood together in joy . And me , zoidberg .

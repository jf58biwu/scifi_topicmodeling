This can ´ t be real . Is it ? My name is Jeff Hale . I ´ m Alice . Alice Lidell Hargreaves . [ Woman Sobbing ] Well , Alice Lidell Hargreaves , something or someone put us here . That ´ s obvious . The metal cannisters , the atmosphere . The air--it ´ s breathable . Give it to me ! That ´ s mine ! It might be a different planet . It might be a different physical dimension , maybe even a spiritual dimension . - You mean heaven ? - Or hell . At this point , anything ´ s possible . [ Man ] Let it go . !

[ Snarling ] [ Grunts , Groaning ] This one is a problem . Enough ! Enough ! Better him than any of us . The one must always be sacrificed for the good of the many . Wait a minute . Who are you ? - A citizen of Rome . And you ? - I ´ m an American . We live by different rules than you do . And how is that relevant here ? Well , we just don ´ t start killing each other . You are the enforcer of your laws ? No , but if we ´ re going to survive here , then we have to learn how to get along with each other . Rules , social order- - the fundamental aim of all responsible citizens who desire a quality of life that raises them above the animal . Yeah , well , that ´ s great , but before we get that far , we may want to find some shelter . You know , I suggest that we establish our positions first ... to avoid confusion amongst the citizens later . What ? What ´ s wrong with you ? Stop it ! [ Choking , Gasping ] Someone do something .

The Yo- - The Yoruba . The Yoruba were an African tribe , I think . White people took you away in a ship . Huh ? Yes . Sixteenth or 17 th century . Portuguese traders , possibly British . Mali . I was also enslaved by white people . By your own people ? Call them another tribe . And as you can see , there are many tribes of many different colors . [ Guard ] Get in . ! - Oh , you poor dear . - Her name is Gwenafra . She is mute . [ Alice , Gasping ] What- - [ Mali Gasps ] My name is Monat . [ Alice ] What is it ? What are you ? I am not human , as you can see , but neither am I dangerous . I assure you . It ´ s all right . Incredible . I am from the star system your astronomers named Tau Ceti . Yes . Tau Ceti . Are there other extraterrestrials here ? Alas , I am the only one . You died on Earth . You were on Earth . - You are 20th century . - Yes , early 21 st . I was an astronaut , just like you . My ship charted a large asteroid approaching your planet . We hastened to warn your authorities , but our intentions were misread and we were shot down . I alone survived the crash . I tried my best under interrogation , but your scientists were skeptical of our advanced projections . Chaos theory . For your people , it was just that- - a theory . For mine , it was a practice . As we predicted , the asteroid ´ s course was deflected when it passed through theJovian Belt . By then , it was too late to stop it . The impact would have equaled the detonation of 100 million of your hydrogen bombs . No life form could have survived . - Well , this is more preposterous than H.G. Wells . - Believe me . Ask around . Find someone who claims to have lived on Earth ... afterJune 18 , 2039 A.D. - What is it saying ? - Use of masculine gender would be appropriate ... when addressing me . [ People Chattering ] He ´ s saying ... the Earth , as we know it , is gone . Your planet is dead , but your species has been preserved . - And no way back ? - One is to assume . Have you found any other forms of intelligence here ? None higher than myself , if you will forgive my lack of humility . How long have you been here ? Two years of freedom . Two days of captivity . We were resurrected together . She appears to be the only human on this planet who has been resurrected as a child . I have no idea why . Neither does she . And Valdemar ? He was one of the first . Ten years on Riverworld- - more than enough time to construct a modest empire . His armies are known to all as the Vandals . My people will hear of this , and they will come for me . Do you see anything ? They ´ re locked up , surrounded by guards . We can go in as merchants . No . No , we can ´ t risk it . Sam , Gwen is a child , and Monat ´ s knowledge is critical for our success . And if we get caught ? No . There are too many other lives depending ´ on us . You know the rules- - go for broke first , go for anything else second . He ´ ll take them to the fortress . When we ´ re free and clear , then we ´ ll come back for ´ em . [ Wind Blowing ] Who are you ? Why have you come here ? All I have to do is raise my voice . Free me . You go your way , I ´ ll go mine . This world is large . We ´ ll never have to meet each other again . [ Hale Sighs ] [ Roman ] The prisoner ´ s free . ! [ Guard ] Get the gate . ! The prisoner ´ s free . ! [ Guard ] After him . ! [ Lev ] Run , Hale . !

[ Dying Groan ] [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Laughing ] - What is your name , prisoner ? - I am Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus , citizen of Rome . And now , a commissioned warrior in my Vandal armies . What say you to that , Flavius ? Flavius Carminus Doremus- - captain of the Praetorian Guard . You were a lot younger when I first promoted you , and I was somewhat more seasoned . Your Majesty , you have returned to us . [ Crowd Chattering ] Well , you might know me better by my public name- - Germanicus Drusus Claudius ... Nero . Emperor of Rome . Hail Nero ! [ Flavius , Men ] Hail Nero . ! Hail Nero ! Hail Nero ! Hail Nero . ! Hail Nero . ! Hail Nero . ! Hail Nero . ! [ Hushed ] Did you miss me ? I knew you ´ d come . When the fighting starts , meet me at the tunnel entrance . There ´ s a way out underground . You ready ? [ Laughing ] [ Scoffs ] Never heard of you . And this is not Rome . This is the Riverworld . And here , my law is the only law . [ People Laughing ] Yeah . ! Get rid of him ! [ Man ] Don ´ t move . ! [ Man # 2 ] Stay back . ! Ah , but , you see , things are gonna get complicated between us . Your death will be sweet . [ Man ] Kill him , Valdemar . ! [ Crowd ] Kill him . ! - Do I not get the benefit of a weapon ? - No . Oh , good . So much more interesting for me . - [ Valdemar Grunting ] - [ Crowd Cheering , Yelling ] [ Cheering , Yelling Continue , Muffled ] Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! [ Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Crowd Cheering , Yelling ] - [ Crowd Cheering ] - [ Groans ] Maybe you will find it as entertaining for you ! [ Crowd Cheering , Yelling ] [ Chattering ] Who else challenges Nero ? Good . All right . Act like slaves . Come on , you lazy bunch of slugs ! Move ! Come on ! Move ! - Prisoners are forbidden to enter here . - Except if Valdemar orders it . - To do what ? - Soldier , if you want to be the one ... that questions the master ´ s orders , go ahead , I ´ ll wait here . - The prisoners have escaped . - Go ahead ! Go . Go then . Move ! Come on , you ! - Move ! Move ! - Close all the exits ! You too . ! Over there . ! [ Man ] Go for it . ! You ´ d never believe what ´ s goin ´ on out there . Oh ! That ´ s not gonna do anything . Please tell me every day on this planet isn ´ t going to be so eventful . What are you doing ? He had a helmet on him . I ´ m sorry . Come on . Everybody , let ´ s go ! [ Wind Blowing ] [ Monat ] My community is two days walk upriver . There is food and safety there . We will take you if you wish . It is the least we can do . - If I go , we all go . - You are strangers . It will not be up to me whether you are allowed to stay , but I will speak on your behalf . I am not one of you . Erzulie will guide me to my people . Lev ! Lev ! Mali ! Mali , where are you going ? Can ´ t force her to come if she doesn ´ t want to . Let ´ s keep movin ´ . - [ Hale ] What ´ s beyond those mountains ? - [ Monat ] No one knows . They are unclimbable . Following the river is the only way to travel in this world . [ Objects Streaking ] The atmosphere must be thinner here than on Earth . Enough to make Riverworlders keep one eye on the ground and one on the sky . The great debate in my time ... was the possibility that life existed on other planets . Hmm . Now you know . How many ? An infinite number . But to end up on this planet with your particular life forms ... in this strange dimension beyond life itself- - that I had not planned on . Well , I guess we ´ re in the same boat , aren ´ t we ? You humans have each other here . You have family , friends , lovers- - all waiting to be discovered . You have that hope . I have no one to discover . I have no hope . We are not in the same boat . We should find shelter and rest . It will be dark soon . The woman is following us . Where ? I don ´ t see her . You ´ re blessed with five senses , Hale . Sight is only one of them . # # [ Chanting In Native Language ] # # [ Chanting ] The other night , when you escaped , the door was locked . There was , uh , somebody- - How do I say this ? He had a hood on . So I couldn ´ t see his face , but I ´ ve seen him before ... under the water . He has some kind of power . He ´ s made me see things . You mean like a vision ? Of what ? I don ´ t know . The future maybe ? [ Grunting ] [ Rocks Fall ] [ Chuckles ] You escaped . Gwen . This is Hale , the man who freed us , and his companions . [ Monat ] This is Tane . He is one of us . Monat , you know the rules . A stranger who saves my life is no longer a stranger to me . He is my friend . Get Sam . Watch yourself . [ Man , Western Drawl ] Monat . It ´ s good to have you back , my friend . You must be Hale . It would seem I owe you a measure of gratitude . Escaping from Valdemar ´ s clutches- - that ´ s quite impressive . - He ´ ll be mad enough to come after you . - No , he won ´ t . He ´ s dead . He who lives by the sword- - - When ? - Yesterday , by a man who claims to be the Roman emperor Nero . Well , that ´ s quite a claim . Though I guess the true Nero has to be somewhere on this planet . Everyone comes here eventually , so it ´ s possible . He saved our lives , Sam . Well , y all know too much now anyway . You can enter our camp , but only on the understanding that you ´ re forbidden to leave until I say so . No exceptions . Very well . Follow me . [ Sawing ] What on earth ? [ Chattering ] Oh , you ´ re not on Earth anymore . Come on . Welcome to the Go For Broke . For my sins , I am the captain . It must have taken years to build a vessel of this- - Six and a half , to be exact . If you please . I modeled her on the steamers I used to pilot up and down the Mississippi . Add a couple of sails for the scaredy ancients among us to make them feel comfortable . Those of us from the civilized democracies , we are in the minority here in this world . The average Riverworlder would kill you as soon as look at you . But on this vessel , you ´ re gonna find some rules and freedoms that don ´ t exist on the land . And with those liberties , we are gonna travel everywhere and anywhere this river will take us . Are you going downriver ? You got a reason we should go upriver ? Yeah . Nobody ever learned anything sailing away from the source . How about seeing the engine room ? Everything you need to see you can see from up here . We used the best materials and men . And we got fellas here who worked on St. Paul ´ s Cathedral , the pyramids , the Titanic , which they tell me was quite an engineering feat , despite its later mishap . I ´ m sure any question you have will be answered soon enough . - [ Clang ] - In the meantime , there ´ s plenty of jobs around here for you to earn your keep . These are your shadows . Doesn ´ t look like we have much of a choice . It ´ s nothing personal . Just can ´ t afford a security risk this close to launching her . Sam . A word . Excuse me . Well , what is it ? I found enough palladium to start the wheels and keep them turning . Where ? A decoration on Valdemar ´ s throne . It ´ s pretty rare , Monat . Any Cetian can smell saturated metal hydride a mile away . Our technology is based on it . Timing ´ s good . With Valdemar gone , it ´ ll be pretty confused around there . I ´ m sure I can get it . Valdemar we knew . Nero we don ´ t . What if one of us gets caught ? No . Can ´ t risk it . Sam , the whole rock gives us enough critical mass to finally launch this boat . I say waiting is the risk . This is not a democracy , Tane . I decide who goes , who stays , when we launch and when we don ´ t . And what I ´ m telling you both is- - I ´ ll think about it . How you ever convinced me to develop this cockamamie technology of yours , I ´ ll never know . What ´ s the matter with a wood-burning furnace anyway ? My boat powered by rocks . - [ Laughter , Chattering ] - Pull it close . Gwen , look . I could make you a pretty dress . Me ? Look , I ´ ve almost forgotten what it ´ s like to wear civilized clothes . How about I teach you to sew as well ? [ Wind Blowing ] I ´ m just gonna take a bath . What , you wanna come watch me ? Whoo ! [ Gasps ] What- - Do you mind ? No , I don ´ t . [ Chuckles ] In my time , when a bunch of us would get together in a hot tub , we ´ d call it a party . - But I guess you didn ´ t do that kind of stuff in your time . - Not if one had manners . I wonder what my children would think of me now ? Did you have a family ? I had a son . He died of leukemia . And his ... mother , well , she tried- - She tried , but she couldn ´ t stand the pain . She took her own life . I ´ m so sorry . So who ´ s gonna get out first ? Not me . [ Chuckles ] - How much of it is mine ? - As far as the eye can see . [ Flavius ] To expand further , we need the ship the rebels are building . Our spies tell us it ´ s nearly ready to launch . Then we should act soon . [ Grunting ] [ Flavius ] We mine enough ore from the rocks that fall from the sky to keep our men fully armed . The rebels steal from the harvest fields occasionally , but it never amounts to much . - Valdemar couldn ´ t catch them ? - They are highly skilled . Sometimes it is better to allow them some freedom . Their ingenuity can be useful . Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day , according to Aunt Polly ´ s varying moods , than he ´ d earned before in a whole year . He hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself . More tomorrow . Time for you to go to sleep . What ´ s this ? [ Chuckling ] Well , who did this for you ? Huh ? It wasn ´ t one of us . One of the new crowd , huh ? Was it Mr. Hale ? Mr. Lev ? Miss Alice ? Miss Alice . Well , well , well . She ´ s quite an artist . And dressmaker too . You two quite like each other , huh ? Don ´ t get too fond of her . Correct me if I ´ m wrong . I don ´ t recall inviting you below decks . Take us with you . I have a hundred berths on board and a hundred workers ready to fill them . Besides , we ´ re goin ´ downriver . That doesn ´ t seem to interest you . Sam , listen to me . In all your years here , have you ever seen a native of this world ? Not in 10 years . There ´ s stories , but that ´ s all they are . They ´ re not stories . Someone came to me while I was still under the water ... and he gave me the power to see the future . I saw Nero . I saw a dark tower wrapped in ice and snow ... and I saw this exact boat headed upriver and I was on it . Well , I reckon if that ´ s our future , then it ´ ll happen just the way you saw it . You don ´ t believe me . I don ´ t believe anyone , and I don ´ t believe in anyone except myself . Then believe in what your eyes are telling you . Believe in that . Look at this world around you- - the obelisk , the cannisters , the food , the clothing . You can ´ t tell me that someone isn ´ t behind this . You spent years working on this boat . Mm . Years ! Don ´ t you want to take it out and find some answers for yourself ? Answers ? Hell . I didn ´ t find any answers in my last life . Why the hell would I want to waste my time trying to find them in this one ? And you forget , I ´ m older than you . I ´ m a lot older than you . I have a 30-year-old body and a 90-year-old mind . And what I have learned in my considerable time is to enjoy the journey , not the destination . Now the closest obelisk is quite a hike . They ´ ll be needing some help in the morning with the canisters . Why don ´ t you go make yourself useful ? [ Grunting ] [ Whistles ] Ah , ah , ah , ah . That ´ s not nice . Up the hill . Up the hill . Monat ! Tane ! Get down here . ! Look what I found . ! Sneaking around . Trying to find- - [ Groaning ] Why did you- - Why did you do that ? He was a spy . A Vandal scout . It is the way of Riverworld . - We could have questioned him . - You are a stranger here . You have no right to question him or me . [ Hale ] Someone . ! I need some help with this man . ! Well , the good news is they won ´ t miss him for a few days . [ Monat ] Sam , if we go now , we can be back before then , ready to launch . They ´ ll never know we were there . If we go where now ? Valdemar ´ s fortress . There ´ s some things there that we need . - [ Monat ] He ´ s been mining the meteors . - Iron for weapons mostly . But meteors contain other useful metals , Hale . The rarest is hydrated palladium , which we intend to use as a fuel for our boiler . Valdemar found a rock large enough to yield an almost perpetual energy source . Perpetual , huh ? Impossible . Cold fusion has formed the basis of Cetian energy production for centuries . The hell with the boat then . Let ´ s build a spaceship ... and we ´ ll just get off this godforsaken planet . Just the two of us . What do you say ? Monat , Tane . [ Sighs ] One of you goes , one of you stays . I can ´ t risk the loss of both of you . I will go . Without Monat ´ s brainpower , the boat doesn ´ t go anywhere . I broke out of there alive . I can break back in . Fine . Both of you go . If you ´ re not back before the next high tide , I ´ m gonna assume the worst . I ´ m gonna launch her without you , on sail power alone . [ Sam ] Even with all these heroics , I can ´ t guarantee you a berth . If there ´ s not enough room for all of us , at least take the others . Get me the damn rock . There may be room on the deck . [ Sighs ] You trust him ? I don ´ t trust any human , even you . [ Tane ] Welcome to the Valley of Meteors . Without them , we wouldn ´ t have had enough ore to make our boiler . We should keep moving . We ´ re entering Vandal borderlands . We should find cover . You got it ? He said it was behind the headboard . Nah , it ´ s gone . Looking for this ? [ Grunting ] You should have freed me when you had the chance . Those who help me are rewarded . You ´ ve done well . Your bargain with Valdemar endures . Bring him with us to the ship . It ´ s a shame to waste such promising centurion material . But he will make a good example for the others . - # # # # [ Tribal ] - [ People Chattering , Laughing ] Would you like to try ? Mm . Yes . - Sam ! - [ Yelling ] Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! - Everybody fight . ! - Surrender , or they die ! Both of them ! Valdemar had more to offer me than just a berth on a boat to nowhere . Sorry . [ Nero ] I gather she ´ s ready to launch at the next high tide . Teach my men how to sail her and your lives will be saved . You , however , can expect no such kindness . The great Neptune will require a sacrifice if my voyages are to prosper . And what better candidate than my first true enemy in this world ? Make it slow . The profit is all in the pain . Keep her apart from the rest . [ Man ] Ah . ! Come on . ! [ Flavius ] With this , we do not need to rely on the wind . And no one on the river can have anything like this . I want to see it work . [ Scoffs ] Now , which of you wants to be the next crew member to die ? Once lit , the energy converts to heat , which creates steam , which creates pressure , which turns the wheel . Good . Have the strongest prisoners load the remaining supplies . Store the others in the hold . - The hold wasn ´ t built for people . - The weak will die , the strong will survive . I fail to see your problem . Oh . Oh , what my legions could have achieved ... with metal hearts beating inside their ships . Everywhere this boat sets anchor , soldiers will be added to my armies , slaves to my work force . You see , the only cure for anarchy is the firm hand and iron will ... of a leader with a vision . For the good of the citizens , Rome must be resurrected . Make him load the ship with the others . Less than 12 hours to high tide . Hold your breath long enough at the end ... and you might just get to see me waving you good-bye . No ! No ! Come on ! No . [ Screams ] Everyone ! You must be still . Be still . Be still . Breathe slowly . Save your strength , or you will die . Are you all right ? If we live , we ´ ll build another boat and sail in the opposite direction . They ´ re not gonna let us live . You and I both know that . The first time I was murdered , I hadn ´ t the strength to go down fighting . Now I do . Are you with me ? Only if we get the chance . Enough talk ! Move it ! Sam . Sam . Move ! Now ! There ´ s a time and a place . Come . If only you ´ d been reasonable . [ Man ] Get in there . ! [ Sam ] Where ´ s Gwen ? Where ´ s Gwen ? I don ´ t know . Gwen ! I can only hope she escaped . Mali , you died in a hold like this , didn ´ t you ? It was all for nothing . This is how you humans comfort each other ? There was a distinct shortage of comfort in Birkenau . In the end , when all was stripped away , the only words of comfort that meant anything to me were these- - I am still alive . [ Scoffs ] Say it . I am still alive ? Again . I am still alive . [ Man ] Is everything ready ? Nero ´ s coming on board . [ Man # 2 ] Yes , sir . The boat is ready . How long till high tide ? Less than an hour . And the woman ? She awaits you in the captain ´ s quarters . I do not wish to be disturbed . Ah . Good girl . Look , if anything bad happens , go to your hiding spot . I like your spirit . The more they evade us , the more we admire them . I know I intrigue you , though you wish I didn ´ t . You ´ re upset about your friend . I did not order his death lightly . But I must establish my authority if I am to bring peace to this world . Oh , is that what you ´ re after ? You revolt me ! Oh . You misunderstand me . I do not claim to be perfect ! How did you get out of that one ? - Good things come in small packages . - Gwen freed you ? She ´ s safe ? Yeah , she ´ s okay . Where ´ s Alice ? All right , listen up . The tide ´ s almost in . So we ´ re gonna launch the boat right away . Hale , it ´ s too risky . They don ´ t know how to sail her yet . That ´ s our advantage . Sam , this is our window of opportunity . There might not be another one . Now , if we ´ re gonna make it through this thing alive , we have got to work together . Now , are you in or are you out ? I ´ ve gotta know right now . [ Man ] Come on , Sam . I ´ m in . Okay . Now , if we want to live , if we want freedom , everyone that steps foot on that deck is gonna have to fight for it . And maybe to the death , if necessary . Are you ready ? Are you ready ? [ Man , Softly ] Yes . Are you ready ? - Yes . - Are you ready ? - [ All Whispering ] Yes . - All right . We ´ re going for the ropes . The men on the ground won ´ t be a factor once we ´ re underway . We have got to come up with a diversion , something to hold them in the beginning . - Leave that to us . - Good . - Lev , can you handle a sword ? - There ´ s a first time for everything . Get two men , meet me on top . Mali , you go for the ropes and then meet us as well . All right , up you go . [ Man ] Okay , let ´ s do it . [ Neck Cracks ] Let ´ s go . One at a time . - Psst . - What are you doing up there ? I told you to stay put . All right , you can stay and help Mali with the ropes . Now , go ! Go ! Lev , I ´ m going after Alice . Good luck . I was inexperienced . Impatient . I lacked the judgment of the elder emperors . But I ´ ve learned from my mistakes . And now I know I need a strong empress by my side ... to steady me , to teach me ... compassion , an emotion I was never allowed to develop in Rome . Choose someone else . [ Screams ] Look , you have secrets . I don ´ t know what you ´ re talking about . You have such pain behind your eyes . Who left you ? Forget him . Consider me instead . I can give you everything . Everything except love . [ Nero ] Ah , love . The ultimate challenge . So Neptune spat you from his waters . - Don ´ t . - Then drop it . Do it . Oh , do it . [ Man ] Everything ´ s secured here . [ Chattering ] These had better work , Monat . They will . Sword . Kick it . You see , the true leader will always sacrifice the one ... for the good of the many , no matter what his feelings . Ready . Clear ! That ´ s the difference between us , Hale . That ´ s why I ´ m destined to rule ... and you ´ re destined to perish . Clear ! Ooh . - Stay here . - Not on your nellie . - Run for the ship ! - Stop them ! They ´ re heading for the boat ! Mali , help . ! [ Hale ] Mali , quick . ! Cut the last ropes . [ Man ] Hold on . ! Unbelievable . We ´ ve launched . Monat , get another rocket . Go to the engine room . Fire up the boiler . [ Yelling ] You never told me about explosives , Sam . - Hell of a launch party . - The engine room . We gotta get out of here . [ Hale ] Watch out for Nero . He ´ s still out there . [ Yelling ] The sails . The current ´ s pushing us towards the rocks . The pressure ´ s up . Here it goes . You ever done any sailing ? I ´ m from Danzig . We learn to sail before we can pee standing up . All right , good . Tie it off and take the wheel . Right . You should go below deck where it ´ s safe . Go on ! Go ! Right now ! Dear God . Oh , dear God . Give me strength . Monat ! What now ? [ Grunting ] How are we ? Full starboard ! Full starboard ! I have almost no control without the engine . I ´ m on it . - Sam ! We need power now , or we ´ re gonna hit the rocks . - What about the sails ? It ´ s keeping us from drifting , but that ´ s about it . We ´ re doing all we can . We got a kink in here somewhere . - Not a technologically sound idea . - Necessity is the mother of invention . [ Hale ] Hit it . ! It ´ s working . ! Wait ! Enough already . She ´ s coming around . [ Lev ] I ´ ve got her . We ´ re in the clear . Good going . Sam , there might be more Vandals on the boat . You go forward . I ´ ll sweep aft . Stay put ! Watch yourself . We ´ re almost clear . Hale , be careful . - Your fight ´ s with me . - I suppose it is . But I asked myself , " Why bother ? " " What an artist the world loses in me . " Famous last words , right ? You ´ ve studied me . How gratifying . Yeah , I ´ ve studied you . I ´ ve studied Nero the emperor , Nero the coward . According to history , you poisoned your way to the top , and then , under your fine leadership , the whole empire fell . Well , history is mistaken . You were the sad end to the Augustan dynasty and the end of Rome . No ! No ! I tried to resurrect a crumbling republic . My own mother , my wife Octavia- - they all plotted against me ... and against Rome . I died fighting against false accusations . You died on the run , and then you killed yourself because you were afraid to face your enemies . That was your legacy . Be very , very careful . Give him your weapon . - I said ... - Come on ! give him your weapon . Move ! I ´ ll die fighting false accusations again , if that ´ s what the gods demand of me . So Neptune will have my sacrifice . [ Spits ] The first person you have ever killed . Yeah . Yeah , up close . He won ´ t be the last . Not by far . Nero ´ s dead . Drop your weapons . Drop it ! Move ! Move ! You can jump or we can push you . [ Yelling ] [ Laughing ] We ´ ve done it ! We won ! We won ! Whoo-hoo ! You fought well . - Are you okay ? - Are you ? It looks like we ´ re going with you whether you like it or not . I guess so . [ Man ] Yes . ! Good work . ! [ Knocking ] You were right . It was one hell of a launch party . Come on in . Well , here ´ s to life on the river . - Well , they all want you to be- - - Sam , I did what I had to do to get us out of there . - This isn ´ t my boat . I didn ´ t build her . - I ´ m not asking you to buy her , Hale . Truth is , all I really want is to be the pilot of the Go For Broke . Mess about on the river . I don ´ t know , maybe- - maybe find myself a little adventure . Mess about on the river , huh ? Kind of like Tom Sawyer ? - Uh-huh . - I don ´ t know if Aunt Polly would approve of that . But I bet Mark Twain would . Or Sam Clemens , as he was known to his friends back in the days when he was ... piloting that steamboat up and down Ole ´ Miss . Mark Twain . I haven ´ t heard that name in years . Born under a comet , died under a comet , partial to meteors . Come on , Sam . Why don ´ t you tell them the truth ? Why don ´ t you tell them who you really are ? Do you miss your family , Hale ? I do . But they know someone named Mark Twain . When I look back on my earthly life , I realized that I was the most happiest ... when I was plain old Sam the boat pilot . Maybe I knew who I was and who I wasn ´ t . Now I figure that ´ s why I ´ m here , to find out ... why that was so . I ´ d sure appreciate it if you let it stay that way ... Captain . Let ´ s head upriver . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Their journey has begun . As you said it would . But will it be completed in time ? Will it be completed at all ? That , none of us can foresee .

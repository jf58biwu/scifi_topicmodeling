 T minus ten seconds to engagement . Whoo-hoo ! - Lo-Fat 's goin ' off ! - Gonna kill ! Gonna kill ! Stay out of my way , geeks . Going to the next level today . I 'm a death machine . Status : combat ready . Situation : guerrilla units in immediate vicinity of insertion module . Whoo ! Yeah ! Let 's do this ! Bring it on ! Whoo ! Look at these heart rates . If I don 't let these boys out , they 're gonna kill each other . Four ... three ... two ... one ... engage . Whoooo ! - Do you see ' em ? - They 're out there , geeks . Looking to fry your huevos . Call it . Retro ! Call it ! Now ! Whoa ! It 's a total massacre out there . Phase two , geeks ! - Ready , knuckleheads ? - Flank right ! - Flank left ! - Go ! Lo-Fat 's down . - You got me , Moxie ? - Got you covered . - Retro 's in . - Adrenaline redline . The bloodthirst is unquenchable . Moxie ? Who 's there ? - Who are you ? - I am Maitreya . This is my game . Agents Mulder and Scully , FBI . We 're expected . I need to scan your ID . Retina scan , please . Cool . Ma 'am ? I 'll need you to look over those nondisclosure agreements . " To protect all proprietary or intellectual property owned by FPS , a private California corporation , under the harshest penalty of law . " Signature at the bottom , please . - FPS ? - First Person Shooter . - Video games . - Digital entertainment . I can get in the Pentagon easier than this . Dudes ! Agent Mulder , what 's up , wild man ? Welcome to the land where silicon meets silicone . Can I get you a latte from the bar or perhaps a bottle of designer H20 ? Scully ? How about a simple explanation as to why we 're here ? Take a moment just to feel the pulse of the new American gold rush . You 're standing on the launch pad of a rocket headed for the stars . OK . - There 's been a little accident . - What kind of accident ? Like an industrial accident . How did the victim die ? - It 's not exactly clear . - Was there equipment involved ? - No . - Yes . Yes and no . - What 's your business here ? - Our business ? We 're consultants to FPS . Laneg did some programming for them . He created the bad guys . Only the Euro-goons . We don 't wanna give the idea we 're major profit participants . Cash or stock options ? Options . Preferred rate . Vested with a short-term exercise against venture collateral to bypass SEC regs . - The IPO 's in a week . - Game ships on Friday . 50 malls across the United States and Japan . Only there 's a dead body between you and untold riches . I don 't know about you guys but I 'd be checking my shorts for cake . - This man 's been shot . - No . When somebody is shot , there 's a gun involved . That is absolutely impossible . There 's no way anybody could ever get a gun past security . What do you call this ? It 's a laser blaster . For wasting cybertrash . - It emits a low-frequency ... - Just let me . The weapons feed off the FPS mainframe . The effect is intensely real , but harmless . You say this weapon is a toy , but this man clearly has gunshot wounds through his ... Stun suit . See , it 's rigged with paint for wounds and kill shots . Total bleeding-edge technology . - He 's dead . I got it . - Who was he playing against ? Against the game . You waste the cyberthugs before they waste you . It 's all about body count . They 're computer-generated images running on a projector . It all happens in the game space . It 's a total digital environment . Nothing 's real . It 's all virtual . Did anybody see what happened ? I was in the control booth with Ivan . Retro was in the zone . His telemetry was solid . He looked unstoppable , like he was on his way to the next level , when suddenly he was cooked meat . Well , the next call 's gonna be to the local PD . No cops ! No cops . You said no cops . You said you had connections . Connections or not , you 've got a murder victim here . Just what the Wall Street money dudes wanna read as we 're going to market . - This is Special Agent Dana Scully ... - You said you were in the control booth ? Can you tell me exactly what you saw ? I 'm still not sure we even saw it . One minute everything was perfect , and then we crashed . Ivan and I were sitting here . We both just looked at each other . It happened so fast . Moxie 's covering Retro who 's going inside to rack up beaucoup points . And then - goosh . Retro 's vitals spike like he 's been shot . And the system defaults . And they 're right back in the game space . - Lo-Fat ! Get over here ! - What happened ? Retro ? Lights up . Game over . What happened in there ? We don 't know . There 's no res images on interior game spaces . What about the wire frame ? Maybe I can . I 'll strip down to wire frame display . I mean , we 've never mapped this area before . Retro was in noncombat space . - It 's a chick . - It can 't be . Can you texture-wrap her ? - Holy Toledo . - She 's packing a flintlock . That ain 't all she 's packing . Can you print that out for me ? Goddess . Let me get this straight . You 've got no murder weapon , no forensic evidence , no motive and no suspect . Scully ? My partner . Agent Mulder . This is Detective Lacoeur . - Have you got something ? - Yeah . Our killer , I believe . Hey , I 'll put out an APB . For Frederick 's of Hollywood . - Mulder , you 're not serious ? - It 's all in the computer . That 's any voluptuous vixen in any number of video games . But she 's not in any video game , she 's in this one , and no one programmed her in . Yeah , but even if they had , she 's not real . She 's a character . She 's some immature hormonal fantasy . Darryl Musashi . You see who that is ? Darryl Musashi . As I live and breathe . - Who 's Darryl Musashi ? - The 0G . Original Guru . He slums as a game designer when he 's not contracted to the CIA . - The boy wonder of virtual mayhem . - What 's he doing here ? Ivan must have called him to go in and slay the ninja babe . Mulder , why does this game have the effect of reducing grown men to moony adolescents ? It 's Darryl Musashi ! - Mulder ? - Huh ? Do you want me to autopsy the body ? Immersion module in descent mode . T minus 20 seconds . Pay attention , worms . Darryl Musashi will show us how this is supposed to be played . I heard he scored 90 consecutive wins on Demon Space Drifter . 91 . Look at him . The man 's a sphinx . T minus ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... engage . Hey , Byers , you gotta see this . Mulder , get over here . Is that him ? Is that Darryl Musashi ? - Yeah , that 's him . - He just stepped into the game . - Why is he just standing there ? - Because he knows no fear , - Yeah ! - Unbelievable . - Standing heart rate is 68 . - He hasn 't even broken a sweat . He 's not even waiting for the reset ! He 's goin ' for the kill . Aaaargh ! Aaargh ! - What just happened ? - She cut off his hands . Preliminary external examination of deceased , a 20-ish male , name listed only as Retro , offers no additional clues as to actual cause of death . Scratch that . Cause of death is from a large entry wound at the sternum , resulting in trauma to the internal organs and blood loss . Wound is consistent with high-velocity impact from a large projectile which passed through a three-ply Kevlar jacket . Scratch that . Wound is the result of high-velocity impact from an unknown object , which even if it did enter the body left no damn trace evidence whatsoever . No powder burns , no chemical signatures of any kind of explosive propellant ... - No luck ? - I thought I was onto something . You know , Mulder , this suit holds more than just exploding paint cells . It measures the player 's vital signs from heart rate to extant body chemistry , then sends that information back to the computer . Then when a player is shot , a battery pack sends a 12-volt jolt that keeps him from getting up until the game is over . - Virtual death . - Yeah , well , if only that were the case . I thought at first maybe the suit had malfunctioned , that one of the charges had blown inward . But unfortunately that wasn 't the case either . I 've got a birthday coming up . You have to admit , this is a pretty amazing piece of technology . Yeah , wasted on a stupid game . Stupid ? Dressing up like hi-tech warriors to play a futuristic version of cowboys and Indians ? What kind of moron gets his ya-yas out like that ? Mulder , what purpose does this game serve except to add to a culture of violence in a country that 's already out of control ? - Who says it adds to it ? - You think taking up weapons and creating gratuitous virtual mayhem has any redeeming value whatsoever ? I mean , that the testosterone frenzy that it creates stops when the game does ? Well , that 's rather sexist , isn 't it ? Maybe the game provides an outlet for certain impulses , fills a void in our genetic makeup that the civilizing effects of society fail to provide for . Well , that must be why men feel the great need to blast the crap out of stuff . Well , testosterone frenzy or no , the only suspect we have in this man 's murder is a woman . Yeah , I 've seen it . A computer-animated woman , Mulder , with a computer-animated weapon . A flintlock . Which would leave a large entry wound . Pictures don 't kill people , Mulder . Guns kill people . As do swords . The world-renowned Darryl Musashi . Mulder . You 're kidding . Thanks . LA Sheriffs Department just picked up a female suspect for the murders . - Who 's the man ? - He 's the man . You the man with the badge . Get the feeling these men have something better to do ? We picked her up outside a strip club in Reseda . Fits your description to a tee . - Was she read her rights ? - About 500 times . For the record , can you state your name , please ? For the record again , my name is Jade Blue Afterglow . I reside ... I 'm sorry . Your real name ? That is my real name . What were you expecting ? Mildred ? No . I sure seem to be upsetting a lot of people around here . - Well , you 're not upsetting me , Miss , uh ... - Afterglow . I sure upset the man running the metal detector . You say that you have no knowledge of Ivan Martinez or a company known as First Person Shooter or FPS ? I meet a lot of men . Would it surprise you to know you have been placed at a crime scene in the offices of FPS ? Let 's just say it takes a whole lot to surprise me . You might wanna start telling the truth . - And what truth am I not telling you ? - That you murdered two men . One with a 14th-century broadsword and the other with a flintlock pistol . Oh . You must have had me confused with my sister . Xena : Warrior Princess . Are you denying that this is you ? - Now I get it . - What ? The medical imaging place in Culver City . I got paid to let them do this body-scan thing . They paid you to scan your body ? You think that 's the strangest thing I 've been paid to do ? We 're very sorry , Miss Afterglow , but , um ... We 're sorry . You 're free to go . I don 't know about you , but I am feeling the great need to blast the crap out of something . - Hello ? - Anybody here ? Phoebe ? Hey , you OK ? Oh . I ... I must 've fell asleep . I was just gonna take a nap . I 've been up for 70 hours straight , analyzing code , trying to fix the game . Where is everybody ? Where 's Ivan ? He 's with the money guys . They 're all freaking . We need to talk to him right away about a woman named Jade Blue Afterglow . He scanned her body and he created a character out of her . He put her in the game . What are they doing ? - The Lone Gunmen are on the floor . - Langly and I wrote a software patch . - We 're gonna run a res-up test on the game . - What for ? To bypass the problem . Hey . - What just happened ? - I don 't know . - They 're in the game . - Phoebe , are you paying attention ? You were supposed to wait until we said we were ready ! - This is the game . - Hey , come on ! Is anyone up there running the program ? I don 't believe this . The program 's running itself . This can 't be happening . Somebody 's shooting at them . This is supposed to be background only , no gameplay . They need help . Mulder ? Nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... engage . Bring it on . - You guys OK ? - We 've been better . - Byers has been hit . - I 'm OK . It 's a flesh wound . Agh ! It 's her . She 's out there . She nailed Byers with that flintlock . OK , on the count of three I 'm gonna lay down some cover , fellas . Ready ? One ... two .. , three . Mulder ! Get in the module ! - What is he doing ? - Don 't go after her ! He 's getting his ya-yas out . - Mulder ! - It 's suicide ! Put the sword down . Mulder ? Oh , no . Where 's Mulder ? I said , where 's Mulder ? Maybe you guys didn 't hear me . Come on , guys . Where is he ? We don 't know . He just took off after her . I saw what he did . But where did he go ? - Into the building . - He was firing his weapon . I saw where he went ! I wanna know where he is . Is there a door ? Or an exit ? Or some kind of passageway that he could have used ? - Just the one you came in . - He should be right here . It 's impossible . It 's a digital environment . It 's just a game . Yeah . - Easy for you to say . - Agent Scully ! I found him . This monitors everyone playing the game . There . Player four . It 's his telemetry . - What do you mean ? - Player four . That 's him . - 0n the monitor . - Right there . - Where ? - That 's Mulder . - He 's alive . - Those are his vitals . - He 's still in the game . - Yes , but where 's the game ? Frohike ? Langly ? Byers ? - I think that 's it . - What are you doing ? Rerouteing the circuitry . Making a kill switch to shut down the game . Don 't touch that . It won 't work . There 's no way to do that . We are back in business . Baby , you are dope . What ? We were toast . I felt the flames licking my ass . Then the bankers saw the letters on the autopsy . FBI . " Cause of death : unknown . " You fixed our problems . We 're gonna be counting Franklins . Yeah , and you 're going to be counting teeth . - Her partner 's lost in the game . - Lost ? - The game has disappeared . - What are you talking about ? Jade Blue Afterglow . Does that ring a bell ? Jade Blue Afterglow Oh , you 'd remember her . Hey . Phoebe ! I don 't know how it happened . You knew about her ? Then it was you . You scanned that woman 's body . Into my computer . She was my creation . She was mine . But why ? You don 't know what it 's like . Day in , day out , choking in a haze of rampant testosterone . - I wouldn 't be so sure . - I mean , she was all I had to keep me sane . My only way to strike back as a woman . She was my goddess . Everything I can never be . But , Phoebe , she is still a killer . I can 't explain it , but she is . You put her in that game . No , I didn 't . I was creating my own game in my own computer . It was totally secret . I never told anyone . But somehow she jumped programs and she 's feeding off the male aggression . It 's making her stronger and stronger . I need your help . You 're the only one who can understand . You 've got to destroy her , Phoebe . - I don 't know how . - Well , there 's got to be some way . There 's got to be some vulnerability or a weakness somewhere . She has no weakness any more . Hey ! I bet you think you 're gonna kick my butt up and down the block . OK . - Her name is Maitreya . - Maitreya ? She 's input herself into the game . We have to download her . We can 't get online . The system 's been hijacked . The program won 't respond . Frohike , what 's wrong ? What is that ? - Mulder 's vitals are wiggy . - What ? They 're all over the map . This is your fault . - You put her here . - Hey . No fair picking ' on a girl . We 're back online . - There 's no picture . - We 're in res-up . No , there 's something wrong . - That 's not the game . - Yes , it is . - It 's level two . - How did that happen ? - Where 's Mulder ? - Mulder 's in level one . - No , he 's right there . - Shut the game down . No , no , no , no . They can 't . - Well , just turn it off ! - Power down , Langly . - It 's not responding . - We have to get him out ! Yeah , and quick . Whoa ! Stop right there ! That 's not really fair , is it ? Well , that 's just cheating . Go , girl ! - She 's on fire ! - The bloodthirst is unquenchable ! - Are you witnessing this ? - Oh , yeah . - Scully 's in the zone ! - Clearly . - What 's wrong ? - This is level two . It only gets harder . No one 's ever beaten level two . - You OK ? - Ask me if I 'm humiliated . Mulder . - It 's nuts . - They 'll never make it . How do you kill something that won 't die ? - What are you doing ? - Stay out of it ! - She 'll destroy it ! - It 's the only way . - Let it go . Both of you ! - You can save them ? - There 's a kill command . - It kills the whole game . - You knew about this ? - She did too . You said it wouldn 't work . That was to save her creation . Her goddess . You don 't care who dies as long as your game survives . - Our friends are in there . - And we 're not gonna let them die . Mulder ? Give me that ! This is out of your hands now . - We have to shut down the program . - You 're the only ones that can do it . - They can 't keep this up . - Scully 's running out of ammo . - What 's the command ? - Don 't do it , Phoebe . We 're so close . - The command ? - Give it to him . Shift Alt " bloodbath " . Oh , my God . We 've killed the game and Mulder and Scully along with it . Over here ! - Scully ! - Mulder ! That 's entertainment ! We came , we saw , we conquered . And if the taste of victory is sweet , the taste of virtual victory is not sweet ' n low , nor the bullets made of sugar . Maybe out past where the imagination ends our true natures lie , waiting to be confronted on their own terms . Out where the intellect is at war with the primitive brain . in the hostile territory of the digital world , where laws are silent and rules disappear in the midst of arms . Born in anarchy with an unquenchable bloodthirst , we shudder to think what might rise up from the darkness . I made this !

 Previously on Farscape ... Aeryn ... She 's carrying my child , my DNA . Aeryn isn 't sure if the child is John Crichton 's . A relationship ... is based on trust . I 'm so sorry . Who saved your life ? Who ? I did . - What is he doin ' here ? - He wants asylum . - Asylum ? - I gave my word ... that he would not be harmed , put your weapons down . - Why did you come here ? - To safeguard John Crichton amongst other things . I will find them again , and when I do they will pay for this humiliation . Distillate of Laka . One whiff , and the pain is gone for a time . It 'll help you forget about Aeryn . And now on Farscape ... Yo , Pilot , you there ? Testing : one , two , three . Uno , dos , tres . Pilot , I got a ... ton of groceries to unload . Pilot ? Damn , I figured they 'd be in range . Are you eager to see the others again ? Nah , it hasn 't been that long . Still ... you miss Aeryn . Or don 't you ? Damn , it 's been a few arns since I thought about her . Then my remedy must be working . Take it for as long as you need it . I don 't ... I don 't need it . It just takes the edge off . Crichton ? Pilot , there you are . It 's about time . Hey , look , get all hands down to the hangar . I got a boatload of crap for you guys ... Unfortunately , nobody is available to ... assist you at the moment . Well , what are they doing , watching Jeopardy ? Get ' em off their butts . Let me talk to Cap 'n James T. D 'Argo . Captain James T. D 'Argo . Ka D 'Argo is currently ... helping Rygel with his ... laundry . And Aeryn 's writing some poetry . What about ... Chiana and Sikozu ? Enjoying each other 's company . Preparing a meal for everyone but Rygel . He 's ... not hungry . Right , well , tell him to save me a plate . I 'm starving . Pod out . Now , isn 't that lovely ? Everyone is getting on so well . Crickets ... Something 's wrong . Maybe the game 's not over with , or Scorpy 's really loose on the ship . Bingo . Moya 's got gatecrashers . An unprecedented reward is offered for information leading to the capture of John Crichton . If he is taken alive , 15 million currency pledges . - If dead ... - Bay 2 . Acknowledged . Prepare Loading Bay 2 for landing . Crichton , I 've ... prepared Bay 2 for landing . Yeah , just give me a minute to get these crates locked down . My mixture is ready . You sure you 're gonna be okay out there ? This 'll keep me in a vacuum coma for at least three arns . It 's most relaxing . You should try it sometime . No , thanks . I 'm not a big fan of vacuum . Stand ready . He 'll dock within 30 microts . Wait ! His approach vector 's wrong . Evacuate our boarding craft ! We 're coming under attack ! Full defensive alert ! Subtitles : PK SUB-66 I SHRINK THEREFORE I AM He 's destroyed our boarding craft . I begin to see why his bounty is so high . Keep searching all tiers . He 's aboard somewhere . Nobody could have survived that explosion . Crichton must be dead . Prak ! Crichton 's alive ... and ingenious . Tier 9 clear . Moving to tier 10 . Who the frell are you ? Your captor . Only temporarily . Let 's not prolong this . Tell Crichton to come to the Command . Tell him yourself . The longer it takes for me to capture Crichton the greater the likelihood that one of you will be damaged . Well , there 's no likelihood we 're going to help you . You 're certain you won 't cooperate ? Why don 't you come and undo these cuffs and just see how much I want to cooperate . Leave him alone . You gain nothing . Probably , but it costs me nothing . I could improve those hideous Luxan features . That would be messier than pain cuffs , but far more entertaining . Crichton ! Surrender at once . You won 't be harmed . We want you alive ... but if you resist ... we 'll take it out on your shipmates . Like so . Sir , nothing can be salvaged of our boarding craft . Should I re-enable one of the transport pods ? No ! It 's slow and weaponless . We 'd be a target for every other bounty hunter in this sector . I 'll send a transmission to the Command Carrier , requesting pickup . It 's too soon . We 'll tell Grayza to come for us only when we 've captured Crichton . As you wish . Silence ! - You have something ? - Maybe . Aeryn ... you know what ? I think we should negotiate . No , I really think we should negotiate . Right ! Silence ! It 's no good . He 's gone . But we know he 's in the ducts . We could pursue him ... up there . Only by making ourselves too vulnerable . No ! We 'll draw him out ... bring him to us . Search this tier ! You know your comrade . Tell me ... which one of you does he care for most ? Me , of course . Aeryn of course , probably Chiana next . Where will Crichton go now ? Center Chamber for a nice hot Raslak . He 'll go to his quarters , gather all his weapons ... that Tarkan shield belt should help the odds . Then he 'll head for Pilot 's Den . What are you staring at , dranuk ? Find Crichton 's quarters . Search for weapons and a shielding device . Crichton 's quarters . Acknowledged . He 'll also try to free the Pilot . Isn 't that right , Crichton ? - Secure the Pilot 's Den ... Be ready . - Got it . Hey ... if I can distract him can you make a break for it ? You know that run-on-walls trick thing ? You know ? Go hide in the neural cluster or something . - Not with these frelling cuffs on , I can 't . - These what cuffs ? ! I am so glad we extended your vocabulary . Listen ! - Play along ... - Oh , okay . I have a very compelling argument for letting us go . Hey ... Soldier Boy . Come here . Hey , don 'cha get ... hot in that armor ? Are you trying to entice me ? Maybe . If I wanted you ... I 'd take you . - Should I show you ? - Yeah ! - Leave her alone ! - Or maybe both of you . - No , please ! Don 't hurt them ! - Quiet ! Report . Any sign of Crichton ? I 'm in his quarters . He hasn 't come near . Scorp ? Scorpius , you son of a bitch . 1812 ... Playin ' possum , huh ? You think you can get any of your brothers up and runnin ' ? Good boy . Be quiet , though . No singing . I 'm gonna go scrounge up a blunderbuss . Oh , relax ... You 'll see Crichton sooner or later . A microt before he kills you . I admire such confidence from the weak and helpless . John ... I 'm not your enemy , be calm . Oh , I 'm calm . I 'm just a little twitchy ' cause , uh ... you sold us out . Nothing of the kind . What , it 's just a coinkidink you 're runnin ' on the loose ? The only reason I escaped capture is because the bounty hunters do not know I 'm here . By the time they got to my cell I was not in it . Now , how 'd that happen ? Oh , I know , I know . - We forgot to lock the door . - The cell door was wholly inadequate . What are you sayin ' ? You opened it with your bare hands ? Gloved hands , yes . You mean you could 'a got out ... anytime you wanted ? I never wanted to . But by the time our attackers arrived , I had to . Whoever they are ... they have managed to capture Moya 's crew in a matter of microts , but they must not capture you . - I don 't cut and run . - We could not run ... if we wished . They 've immobilized all escape craft with magnetic locks , and disabled the DRDs , all except for that one . Yeah , 1812 's on a different wave length . He 's not from Moya . But if he restarts the others we will have more firepower . I don 't have time for that . I 'm goin ' ... wabbit hunting . You can 't take them all at once . How dumb do you think I am ? You take ' em down one by one , the Die Hard way . By luring them into an ambush . You could do it with some assistance . You really think our relationship ... has progressed that far ? Just remember whose side you 're on . This is John Crichton ... paging the head Cylon . Pick up the phone , Imperious Leader . Crichton ... how pleasant to hear from you . Let 's have a little chat . First off money . We can pay you more than the Peacekeepers will . No deal . Surrender at once . - And why would I do that ? - To reduce the suffering of your crewmates . It 's the only choice you have . Don 't doubt for a microt that you will be captured . You know , for a guy with no mouth you sure talk big . Brilliant . Why don 't you come down here and find me , Gort ? Klaatu barada nikto . - Mission accomplished , John . - Screw you . He 's on the lower tier . Somewhere in the atmospheric system . Check the airflow chambers . Are you looking for someone ? Thank you , John . Como estas , la cucaracha ? You didn 't expect me to give you a loaded weapon , did you ? - Well , yes . - Let 's have a look at this guy . Damn ! What the hell is this ? - It 's like ... Mr. Pumpkinhead . - Organic core . Bioengineered armor shell . Crunchy on the outside , chewy on the inside . - How 're your ribs ? - As if you care , my armor worked ... barely . - One down ... - Five to go . And you have a weapon that works . No . This bazooka 's outta ammo . You can have it . I may well have joined the wrong side . Dead ? How ? Multiple blasts from a large yield weapon . So ... Crichton 's more formidable than I thought . I told you , but would you listen ? No . They never listen . Not too late to cut your losses ... and run . Oh , it 's still early . Initiate the containment plan . All right , I got Winona , an extra pulse pistol ... two pulse rifles ... two DRDs , maybe four . Eight , sixteen , or sixty-four , it won 't be enough . Well , there 's always the ... pulse chamber overload trick . If you can lure them close enough . I 'm gonna need a volunteer for a dangerous mission . The torment continues . No one asked you . You ! Get to your feet . What are you going to do with them ? I told you to be silent . What the frell ... ? Get up ! What now ? Going for a little walk , are we ? - Something like that . - Hey , hey ! Frellnik . Before you do whatever you 've got in mind , let 's talk . If this is about currency , I 'm assure I can more than match whatever you 're being paid for me . Delivering you dead would cost me ... but it might just be worth it . Tell Crichton what you just witnessed . Crichton , don 't talk ... just listen . They 've somehow reduced D 'Argo in size . He 's alive , but he 's no larger than a hand length . And he 's imprisoned inside the head bounty hunter . And the rest of your crewmates will follow . So , put away your weaponry . Killing one of us means you 'll be killing one or more of your friends . Do you understand ? Aeryn 's right , don 't answer . Keep them guessing . You see how hopeless it is . Face the inevitable . Give yourself up . Crichton , the device appears to be activated by a combination of numbers on the handset . I 'm told you care for her . So stop fighting and you 'll save her life . You can 't even consider giving up . Grayza ... will not let any of you live . I 'm not giving up , and you 're the one who looks like crap . Oh , don 't worry about me . I 'm merely overheating . So we 've gone from Die Hard to Honey , I Shrunk The Hostages ... - unless that guy is bluffing Aeryn . - I don 't think so . Forgive me , my mind isn 't clear , but I seem to recall a Peacekeeper file about a species called the Coreeshi . - These are our pumpkin people ? - Oh , yes ! Capable of constructing organic shells in various forms . They also ... are reputed to possess ... reduction technology . Great . So now I gotta take these guys down and I can 't hurt ' em . I 'm sure that point is a bluff . To keep their prisoners alive containment must be almost impossible to damage . I can 't take that chance . Is there another choice ? Wake up . Hynerian , wake up ! My name isn 't ' Hynerian ' . It 's Rygel the Sixteenth . You ... may call me ' Dominar ' . This is scarcely the time to obsess about how you 're addressed . Look around you ! One more prison . So what ? I 've seen far worse . Do you have any idea how small you are ? You 're not exactly a giant yourself . You have been reduced in size ! You 're hardly bigger than a filima bug now ! Except ... except this can 't be happening . Can 't it ? No ... No . Reduction by ... proportionately subtracting atoms would leave our brains too simple to function . So ? Maybe they just made all our atoms smaller . But then we couldn 't breathe normal sized air molecules , don 't you see ? No . No . This isn 't happening because ... it is not possible . Your brain isn 't functioning . Do you think this is all just a hallucination ? Do you like that explanation better , hm ? - No ... but I simply cannot comprehend how ... - Neither can I. Who cares ? We 're here , they did it , and that 's that . You consider yourself intelligent ? Yes , I do . Then stop behaving like a child . I am not a child ! No , you 're an infant ! You 've studied but you haven 't experienced . - You know nothing of life . - And you do ? I 've been around long enough to know how ignorant I am . I don 't assume the universe obeys my preconceptions . Ah ! But I know a frelling fact when it hits me in the face . That 's good work . You 're smoking . You know that 's not good for you . The replacement cooling rod Sikozu has formulated does not function as well in times of exertion . Then don 't exert . Hit the bench , go on . How did you survive this far ? Charm ... Good looks Winning attitude . Here we go . And batter up . 1812 , don 't cut it loose till I give you the signal . I 'm hearing something on tier 16 . Treblin side . - I 'll check it out . - Negative ! Hold position . - Devvak , you go in first . - Acknowledged . Come out , Crichton . I have Aeryn and Chiana . If you destroy me , you destroy them . And you certainly won 't destroy me with that . Pulse chamber overload . - Not very creative ... - 1812 ! Bear trap ... ugly but creative . And that ... is how we survived . The containment capsule is ... here ! 1812 ... light it up . What 's that ? What 's goin ' on ? - Contact lost on tier 16 . - All hands , get down there now ! There 's no more time . Take this ! - We 're out ? Crichton 's got us . - Aeryn , Pip , you okay ? - Oh , yeah ! - Over here ! - Run for it , save them ! - 1812 , this way . Pick it up , pick it up ! Go , John , go ! Who is he ? - Do you think he 's worth anything ? - Either he 's worth something ... or he 's dead . You guys all right ? Where are we ? I can 't see . You 're out of the bounty hunter 's body ... but you 're still tiny . And you 're stuck in a beer can . And since these cuffs are magnetic we 're not going anywhere in a hurry . Right , first priority we get you guys outta there . No . First priority is rescuing the others . We can wait . Right . Gonna need a new plan . I 'm on it . Crichton ... Congratulations on retrieving the females . I assume they 're alive and ... intact . Of course , you can 't set them free nor restore their size without my help . I understand you care for them . I offer a deal . Turn yourself in , and I 'll restore their size and set them free . Yeah , well , why are you suddenly feeling ' so generous ? You 're costing me bodies and time . I 'll pass up the bounties I 'd earn on the females in exchange for you . - What about the others ? - I 'm not that generous . Maybe ... you 'll feel more generous ... after you 've lost a few pints of your own blood . You know where the others are ? I saw Sikozu get shrunk ... but I didn 't see where they put her . Same for D 'Argo and Rygel . I ... I used my visions . Everything slowed down and I ... I know how they do the shrinking . - How 's that ? - The armor . Left arm . There 's a keypad . I know the codes for shrinking , and I ... I know the codes to get the cuffs off . That 's good work , Chi . It 's too bad we don 't have some of that armor ourselves . What do we have ? We got you , me , a couple of DRDs , and some weapons that only tickle the bad guys . What happened to the old woman ? - Any idea who he is ? - No . He was working with Crichton ? He 's the only reason Crichton got away . Crichton was hit in the leg . He was leaking vital fluids in the passageway . If you can 't capture a wounded target you 'll be leaking vital fluids as well . Get moving ! Well , well ... Scorpius . - How 's the ride ? - We 're all right . I 'm still blind . Maybe ... maybe it won 't go away . It 's okay . Your sight 's always come back before . Maybe this is one time too many ... W ... what if it doesn 't come back ? Well , using your sight the way you did ... may be the only thing that saves us . Without those codes we 'll never return to normal size . It 's just the dark . You don 't know what 's coming , and ah ... there 's nothing you can do . I hate that feeling . Wake up ! Why are you here ? Because you captured me . - That won 't work on me . - So you know . Did you think that armor would fool me ? - I know what you are . - Then you should bow down ! Entropy will claim the universe before I bow down to a Scarran ! Even one of the Ruling Order ? Particularly ... the Ruling Order . Grafting yourself ... into a Coreeshi exoskeleton ? - How ingenious ! - Yes ... How many Peacekeepers have dealt with you ... not knowing you 're a Scarran spy ? Too many to count . You 're not after Crichton for the bounty . You want to take him back to your masters . We 're eager to learn why both you and ... But ... capturing you is a bonus beyond measure . It shall be my honor to return you to your birthplace . It will be my honor ... to see you dead ! Not likely . Yeah ! That 's gonna work . All right . I got the plan . How 's my breath ? Death ... by laser guillotine . - Four DRDs ... clothesline the suckers . - And not harm their captives ? Might work . Probably won 't . Don 't be small-minded . - Chiana , how 're the peepers ? - Good . Makin ' out colors and shapes . Right . Well , you two talk amongst yourselves , I got work to do . - Crichton ! - Bastard ! Sorry about that . Enjoy the ride , Scorpius . Ka D 'Argo ... overcome your lethargy now . Moya 's crew is in danger . Where the frell are we , and what are you doing here ? You have a comms . Signal Crichton immediately . Answers first . All right . All the brothers down with the plan ? Be quiet . How 're my little inaction figures ? I can see , but it 's ... it 's all blurry . Right . If I get the time , I 'll ... do something about that . After I release two of your arms , you 'll open an encoded channel on a vector and frequency I designate . If you do anything else ... I 'll kill you ... and then this Leviathan . I 'll do as you say . A Scarran spy ? He intends to capture Crichton . Not for the Peacekeepers , but for the Scarrans . Crichton needs to know this . He cannot fall into Scarran hands . Why should I believe you ? Wait ... Scarran military code . He 's signaling to a dreadnought ... to come get him and his prisoners . Bounty hunters may have spared Moya . The Scarrans won 't . John ? - John , can you hear me ? - Yeah . Hidey-ho , D. Where are you ? Fine . I 'm in some sort of cylindrical prison . Look , it doesn 't matter . Can you trust Scorpius ? More today than yesterday . Why ? He thinks we might have a Scarran on our hands . And that the Scarran is calling in a dreadnought . Interesting . That could be useful . Thanks . John , the Scarran 's forcing Pilot to transmit the message now . Right . Keep me posted . Found him . Cargo bay . Tier 20 . I 've got treblin side . You take hamman side . Watch for traps . Almost in position . Go in 10 microts . Oh , crap ! Best laid plans . Oh , hell , this is gonna hurt . We 've got Crichton . Tier 20 . Cargo bay . Hold him there . I 'll come shortly . No acknowledgement of my signal ? Not yet . What was that ? - They ... they said they had Crichton . - Maybe it 's part of the trap . I hope ... it 's part of the trap . Henchmen ... Always the last to know and the first to get hurt . I 've got some bad news for you guys . Your ... boss ... - ... he 's not a battlebot , he 's a Scarran . - Ridiculous . Well , take the can opener to him . Find out for yourself ... but you better do it quick because he 's just called for a dreadnought to take him back to Scarranburg . All right . Go check it out . He 's in Pilot 's Den right now . Well , why don 't you have Pilot play back the message and you can have your chief explain why he 's talkin ' in Scarran ? Fellas ... I got no axe to grind . Peacekeepers , Scarrans ... I 'm dead either way . You guys ... crap man , you oughta be concerned . What 's it gonna cost you to check it out ? Nothin ' . I 'm lyin ' ? You can take it outta my hide , but if I 'm tellin ' the truth ? Yeah ... we 're gonna smoke the peace pipe . Watch him ! Axikor . What are you doing here ? - Open your armor . - Why ? To prove you are a Coreeshi , and not a Scarran ! Don 't be foolish . Open it ... now ! Man , I hope you guys are still under warranty . 1812 , get these arms off quick ! You ... killed him . You can be next . - Transmission ? - Yes . That a girl . All right , Chiana , start teaching ' me those combinations . Will do . The dreadnought signals it won 't risk traveling to Moya . - Not with a command carrier in the area . - That 's good . He 's been ordered to make his own way off Moya , and to rendezvous with the dreadnought elsewhere . Well ... that 's bad . Oh , God , it 's still warm . Okay ... Nurse , I am , uh ... ready for surgery . First thing : the cuffs . - So far , so good . - Excellent . Beer can 's next . Damn , no winners there . Hey ! How about that ? I got a tadpole ! Crichton , get us out of here ! Make us normal size . - Please ! - I don 't know about that Rygel . Chiana only gave me the codes for makin ' things smaller , not bigger . I don 't wanna blow you up . John ! John , we 're on the move again . I think the Scarran 's making a run for it . He may try and steal a transport pod . Actually , if he wants something faster , he may try and steal Aeryn 's prowler . - Frell ! - Right . I 'll try and cut him off at the pass . 1812 , keep an eye on the little people . He 'll never beat the Scarran to the prowler . - Hey , where you goin ' ? - Sit tight . Crichton ! I 'll disable the prowler . You take care of the Scarran . Fire . You should pick on somebody your own size . Hiya , fellas . John ! Crichton . Excellent . Scorpius will have someone to keep him company on his journey . Back to Scarranburg ? I don 't think so . - Get big code . - You 're mine now ... Crap ! Hope I can do this . So , you 're an upper-class Scarran ? Not like the horse-faces I 'm used to . - You 'll soon be meeting more of me . - Remind me to shave . One small step for man . E donde esta la cucaracha ? John , what the frell are we gonna do with Scorpius ? Man , I just don 't know . He could 'a gone to ground , but he ... he didn 't . He put is his ass on the line for us , I guess . I don 't know , I just ... - John ... - I just don 't know ... D , look ! Bottom line . I don 't think we have a cage that 's gonna hold the son of a bitch . - I agree with you on all counts . - Yeah . We should still keep a close eye on him at all times . Twenty-four / seven . - Crichton ? - Yeah , Ryge ? There 's a wrinkled old woman floating outside the forward portal . Whoa . Gigantic oops . Can you do me a favor ? Pop outside the tier 3 treblin side hatch and haul Granny in ? - Noranti ... is outside ? - Yeah , don 't-don 't ask . She she 's got some red Play-Doh in her pocket . - Dose her with that when she gets in and she should be all right . - It 's taken care of . - Officer Sun . - Yes , Pilot ? Commander Crichton and I would like your advice ... - before we broach a topic with Captain D 'Argo . - Go ahead . In view of the continuing danger we face in Peacekeeper space , and even in the Uncharted Territories ... and given that the Scarrans will also be looking for us now ... I 'm reluctantly forced to consider traveling into Tormented Space . Aeryn , you know what that is ? Aeryn ? Um ... . it 's a place where neither Peacekeepers nor Scarrans will travel . Right . It 's a rough neighborhood . A bit hard to know . Few credible reports have made it back from there since . Those who go there usually vanish . Navigation there is extremely hazardous . Many ships have been lost . The area is reputed to be a nexus of wormholes . So I 've been told . And Moya is cool with that ? She 's understandably reticent to go there , but ... she sees no other choice . - Nor do I , Pilot . - Well , look on the bright side . It can 't be any worse than some of the places we 've been lately . Trust me . It can . Subtitles : PK SUB-66 ( Evilman , Ferllings , Krack Shuluk )

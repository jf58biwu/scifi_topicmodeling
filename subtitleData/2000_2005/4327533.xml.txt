 Oblongs , Oblongs Down in the valley where a chemical spill Came from the people living up on the Hill There 's a family by the landfill with hazardous foam In their happy glowing home Oblongs The weekend . Let 's take a load off the old dogs . And now for the sweet , nonsexual embrace of Mr. Sandman . Drive me somewhere , drive me anywhere . Just drive me . Pickles , I spend every Saturday chauffeuring the family . Couldn 't you do it just this once ? I was supine . Let me see. I 'm good for welding , but driving 's out of the question . - Don 't worry . - As soon as we get our license you won 't have to drive us . - Will you drive us to driver 's- - - Nipples ? - Ed . Driver 's ed . - Sorry. I 'm a teenage boy . I think about nipples every nine seconds . As long as we 're in the neighborhood , I can stop at the hattery . I dropped off my fedora to be blocked and refeathered 1 4 years ago . I 've been busy chauffeuring everyone to pick it up . Seems to be a ramen house now . Maybe it 's a good time to try out my Mandarin . We 're gonna be late for driver 's ed . What is wrong with you ? I 'm sorry . My desire to wear a hat and speak Chinese is getting in the way ... - ... of my duties as a father . - Just drive ! Welcome . Most of you know me as the coach . I also teach sex education and driver 's ed . Will someone please tell me which one this is ? - lt 's driver 's ed , coach . - Super . Then I won 't be needing this penis in formaldehyde . Since you 're mostly rich Hill kids and your parents pay my salary we 'll address the driving concerns important to you . First , how to operate a six-CD changer in the Beamer 700 Series . We just have an eight-track with an old Foreigner tape stuck in it . There 's no sense you boys being in this class . Why don 't you go out in the hall and read about chlamydia . So , anyway , that 's how the panda bears got into the Dairy Queen and why I need a lawyer . Biff , Chip , how was your day ? It sucked . We got thrown out of driver 's ed . We 'll never get our license . We 'll miss out on everything . - Drive-ins , drive-thrus . - Drive-bys . You don 't need a class to learn how to drive . - l 'll teach you . - Dad , it 's crazy that you drive at all . - l don 't know if you should be teaching . - Oh , nonsense . Sweetheart , this roast is fantabulous . - lt 's spaghetti . - And it 's a-delicious . All right , now , hands at 1 0 , 2 , 4 and 8 . You wanna pull over every couple of blocks to make sure you 're not dragging anything . I tap my horn constantly to let the other drivers know I 'm around . Look out ! Stop sign ! Son of a- - Oh , lordy . All right , let me do the talking . I know how to handle Johnny Law . Guess you know why I pulled you over . You need to have that baby secured in a car seat . Now you see here ! I am not- - All right , I have to sit next to the driver . How are we gonna do this ? - You can sit on our middle leg . - Congratulations . You pass . Your first driver 's license . My boys are growing up . Soon you 'll be drafted and go off to fight and die in some godforsaken rice paddy , and for what ? For what ? Dad , she 's doing it again . Pickles , dear , good news . Two more designated drivers in the house . Mommy 's back . - Hold on . We are not a taxi service . - Yeah , we have teenage stuff to do . Like hanging out at the abandoned quarry with friends . Yeah , and hitting on quarry skanks . Boys , part of growing up is learning to think of others instead of just yourselves . And skanks . I have a list of errands that need to be run . Boys , do you want to get into heaven or not ? All right , but I get to drive . Dude , that presents certain complications . That should do her . Don 't forget to thank your Grammy for the use of her chair . - Thanks , Grammy . - Thanks , Grammy . Okay . Next stop , Michael Wong 's bar mitzvah . Poodles . Sorry , old gal . Okay . First stop , the abandoned quarry . Dad said no . - You 're such a mama 's boy . - And you 're a latent homosexual . Well , well , well . I 've seen driver 's-side airbags but I 've never seen a driver 's-side douchebag . Care to put your motor where your mouth is ? Let 's drag ! We 're headed for the gorge . - Hit the brakes . - l am . - That 's the gas , stupid . - No , that 's your leg , dufus . Guys ? Guess we 'd better go home and tell Dad . Hey , it 's my turn to drive . A car accident ? This is what happens when you put yourselves before family . I told you to stay away from that gravel pit . - lt 's a quarry , Dad . - Can the sassafras , mister . I already cutted some switches . I left some sharp points on them . So this dent , is it noticeable ? My goodness . That 's gonna rattle like the dickens . And we have no money for a new car . Now , Bob , we should just thank the Lord our boys weren 't hurt . Anyone seen my Chippendales lighter ? I think I saw it in the front seat . Why me ? Why me ? You 'll be okay on the bus. I wrote our number on the back of your underwear or someone 's underwear . I 'm looking forward to my bus ride . Public transportation is a great place for community interaction . You getting on , slug boy ? You bet I am . And I brought my magnetic checkers . God love him . He 's gonna get his ass kicked . Mr. Bus Driver , I 'd like to disembark . - We don 't stop here . - But we are stopped . Gosh , and to think it was my lifelong dream to be a good bus driver . Somebody drop a bottle ? Thanks for nothing ! I bet all the bagels are gone . - Where 's everyone going ? - Our shift is over , Bob . - You missed the whole day . - Well , fiddlesticks and coffeepots . Want a lift home ? I got crackers . Thanks , James , but I 'd hate to waste this free bus transfer . - Oblong . - l know , sir . - l 'm terribly sorry I missed work . - You missed work ? I was just gonna yell at you to loosen some phlegm . Will I still get paid for today ? There we go . - You get rid of that loogie ? - Thankfully . We should be going . Our dinner reservations are for 7 . Punch me in the stomach as hard as you can . Thank you . No . Sit on my back , Sally . Mayor , since you 're here , why don 't I give you your semiannual bribe ? Are you nuts ? I can 't walk out of here with 80 grand in a bag . I 'll attract attention . Sir , you 're wearing a Mexican wrestling mask . Just put it in the usual spot . Now hit me in the groin with that golf club . That hurts more than I thought it would . Hello. I 'm home . - Bob , it 's 1 in the morning . - Little mix-up with the buses . No worries . Now I 've got a transit schedule . According to this , the only bus that will get you to work on time leaves in nine minutes . Right . Well , I 'm off . I wonder if I have time to use the facilities . Oops . Schedule 's upside-down . You only have six minutes . I 'll just pee in the bus like everyone else . Poor baby . I know it 's not true , but somehow I feel like this is our fault . Well , like you said , it 's not true , so let 's go to bed . Hello . I 'm Sheriff Pepper inviting you to the government auction of seized property . We got it all . Uzis , live ostriches , pinky rings , whore clothes or drive home in your very own getaway car for as low as $ 50 . See ? Crime does pay , for you . This is how we can make it up to Dad . Yeah , he 'd love a pinky ring . This is so exciting. I 've never seen so many scumbags in one place . Okay , this little beauty was used in a recent kidnapping . New paint , tires , and look at all this trunk room . Next up , we have this green sedan . It looks like Government Issue , so imagine what sick crap went down in there . Let 's start the bidding at , oh , let 's say $ 30 . - What 's he saying ? - l don 't know. I 'll ask . Sold for $ 50.25 . - Dude , we only have 50 . - l have a quarter . - Give it . - Only if it can be my car too . Fine , ass-butt . I 'm not gonna kid you . This car has some problems . - Do I hear a penny ? - No ! I can 't believe you bought us this car . My boys bought me this car . They 're lovely , lovely boys . Dad , will you shut up ? There seems to be some play in the wheel . Just what I thought . You 've got a big bag of money jammed in your steering column . Lordy . What will that cost to fix ? Wait ! Did you just say there 's a big bag of money in my car ? No . He said there 's a big bag of money in our car ! We 're rich ! Yeah ! We 're rich ! It 's part my car too . - Yeah , we 're all rich except for Dad ! - Yeah ! Hold on . That money belongs to somebody . We have to take it to the authorities . Our reward will be a hearty handshake and the warm feeling that comes with a job well done . Let 's stuff him in a mailbox . And after that nice letter carrier let me out , we came straight here . Well , the car 's title has the three boys names on it , Mr. Oblong . Legally , the $ 80,000 belongs to them . Sheriff , are you sure ? Sure as any man can be who had a bottle of Pinot Grigio for lunch . What do you mean , sold ? But my hard-earned bribe money was in that car . I 'll pulverize you . You know you 're not hitting me , right ? Really ? It sounds like I am . No , you 're just stomping your foot and stroking me with the soft part of your arm . It 's actually quite soothing . So I had a talk with them and I 'm confident they 're going to use the money for the good of us all . What 's up ? What is up with y 'all ? Milo , that was a $ 9 coffee table . Here 's a hunsky . Keep the change . No , no. I 'd rather you work it off doing chores and such . Bob , are you nuts ? They 've got 80 large. I want a taste . This is the perfect opportunity for them to learn about putting others before yourself . When they see us going without , they won 't be able to enjoy that filthy lucre . Watch it , mister ! That 's an $ 1 1 hi-fi . Oh , Kyoko , the years are just melting away . More unagi , please . - That 's eel . - l know what it is . Cancel the unagi . You know , I 've got a terrible crick in my neck . Maybe- - Sorry . You can 't afford her . So have you boys learned your lesson about sharing ? He 's poor as a church mouse . Papa-san look like sushi . - Mayor Bledsoe ? - Hello. ls your daddy home ? Gosh dog it , I am the daddy . Oh , well , I noticed a vintage government sedan out front and , as it happens , I 'm something of a K-car nut . Are you interested in selling ? - l 'll go as high as 2000 . - Well , I depend on that car to get to work . - So I 'm afraid- - - Sold ! I can use this chump change to blot the oil off my forehead . It 's not here . Where is it ? Where 's my money ? I want my money . Do you think this has something to do with the 80 grand you found in that car ? No. I 'm sure it 's just all the years of steroid abuse . Can I watch Velva the Warrior on one of those ? - No . - But you 're both watching the same thing . That 's because we 're rich . - We are still rich , aren 't we ? - Stinking . Here are your pancakes , sweetie . Those look good . Lay a stack on me , woman . Sure . For selfish people , they 're $ 1 000 a stack . I 'll sell you mine for $ 800 . Beth , I 'm trying to teach the boys a lesson . I 'll give you both $ 200 to shut up . - Done . - Boys I won 't have you corrupting the womenfolk . Why don 't you let us enjoy our money ? It 's not like it 's hurting anyone . Somebody threw a rock . I bet it 's those angry lesbians who live across the street . Sheriff Pepper , thank God you 're here . Someone just threw a rock through our window . Did it look anything like this ? It was a different window , but , yes , pretty much like that . You 're the one who threw the first rock . That money you found is the mayor 's bribe money . Every public servant in the city gets a cut and we all want our share . But , sheriff , you 're the one who said the money belongs to my boys . I can 't force them to give it up . - Did you just shock me ? - l don 't know . Did it feel something like this ? Stop doing that ! Sure is cold in this house since the city shut off the gas . I think I 'm catching ammonia . - lt 's pneumonia , Beth . - lt 's too cold for silent P 's . Well , looks like they 're finally picking up our garbage . Guess now they realize what greedy gilberts they 've been . Yep . People are learning lessons all over the place . Look , Bob , we have to give that money back . Let me have a talk with the boys . Biff , Chip , Milo . - How come you guys aren 't cold ? - We bought special underwear from NASA . It also has a pee pouch . I 'm going right now . Yes . Very good . Listen , boys , maybe you should give the money back to the mayor especially in light of the nightmarish harassment . Are you saying we have to give it back ? No. I 'm just saying it 's the right thing to do . Oh , then forget it . We 'll let that percolate for a while . What fresh hell is this ? Attention , Oblongs . Since we didn 't get our kickbacks , please accept this gift of cats in heat . This is too much ! These pussies are really horny ! Let 's take our money and get the hell out of here . I can 't help but feel that you only like us now because we have money . Duh . Want a foot massage ? Hey , I wanna give him a foot massage ! - l do ! - Forget it ! - Get off- - - Girls , girls , relax . There 's plenty of feet to go around . Wow , a Jacuzzi full of MM 'S . I could get used to this . I hear the green ones make you randy . Yeah , I 'd appreciate if you didn 't eat any of those . And the best part is , they melt in your mouth , not in your hands . Unfortunately , the same cannot be said of armpits . Coach , sparkler . What fool said money can 't buy happiness ? This no longer pleases me . Money fire ! Money fire ! Oh , my God , it 's burning like paper ! - Run ! - You run ! The candy ! Somebody save the candy . God help us if it spreads to the dirty gym clothes . Too late . - My babies , are you okay ? - Yeah , but our money 's not . - Everyone 's out , chief . - Good , now let 's watch her burn . Wow , this is neat . I hope there 's a backdraft . - Aren 't you gonna put it out ? - Sorry , no kicky-backy , no fire put-y out-y . That didn 't sound as good as I 'd hoped . Has the whole world gone crazy , or is it me ? I 've tried to teach my sons the value of giving and service to others . But I guess my beliefs have gone the way of spats and the Betamax . Greed and selfishness are the fashion of the day . Well , you win. I promise I 'll pay back your dirty bribe money if it takes me the rest of my life . I still believe in your stupid ways , Dad . Yeah , me too. I 'm kind of ashamed . Here , we 've got $ 37 left . All I 've got is this Fabergé egg , but you 're welcome to it . - l guess I can spare a few bucks . - l 'll kick in . - Me too . - Here 's some . - Take this . - How about this ? It 's going to be a wonderful Christmas after all . Bob , that 's almost a year away . I want a sweater . Mr. Mayor , on behalf of the entire city , please accept this heartfelt bribe . My God . You poor , destitute people gave up your few meager dollars for me ? I don 't know what to say , except : Now let 's put out that fire . Oh , well , we 'll get the next one . Well , let 's go home . How ? We can 't all fit on that scooter , and I 'm not making two trips . Here , you can have your piece-of-crap sedan back . I can 't get the smell of you people out of it anyway . I 'd vote for him again . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

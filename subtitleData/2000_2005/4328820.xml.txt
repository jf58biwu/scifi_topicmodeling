 Fall back ! Come on ! Get up ! That 's an order ! Argh ! If you can hear me , I need help . I need help ! We 're gone ! Cleo ! I just lost contact with the team leader , Hel - What level ? ASE 26 . The Souterrain level . - It 's an ASE level . Perfect . More work space . - What ? - You two don 't elaborate much , do you ? Waste of air . You 're close , Hel . - Throttle down ! - There 's no visible entrance . Your position is correct . Well , I 'm not seeing it . I 'll find it . Don 't move . Hey ! What the ... ? What 's going on ? - I didn 't do that . Did I do that ? Where are we ? Oh , my God ! Guys , this is very cool , but ... OK , I 'm just a tad confused . How is this possible ? 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth Snow ? Temperature regulated . 20th-century-inspired architecture . The attention to detail is astounding . Are we still underground ? Yep . A few kinks to work out , but still , it 's a pretty impressive ASE level . - ASE ? - A level with an Artificial Surface Environment . - We 've only charted a handful . - This is the only one that simulates winter . Trust me , it 's a pretty mild winter . This way . Oh , it 's so beautiful . - - Take cover . - What are we doing ? - Ssh ! Daddy , I didn 't know there were monsters . So now you know . For every scary monster that tries to spoil your dreams , there 's that one guardian angel , who 's always wide awake . Who sees that monster even before you do . FATHER : And what does that angel do when he sees that cowardly monster ? - He calls you . - Mm-hm . And that 's when I come ... to take care of you . WOMAN : Nole ! Nole , honey . There you are . - What 's the matter ? - There 's something going on outside . Come on . I think he 's dead . What 's everybody looking at , Daddy ? Something you don 't have to see , sweetie . NOLE : Let 's go home now . Voice , we found one . What 's his condition ? - Dead . We need to identify him , Hel . - Hey , Cleo . - Hm ? OK , people , come on ! Step back , all right ? There 's nothing to see here . We 'll take it from here . - You can just go on home . Go home . Yes ? - Who are you ? I 'm US Marshal Sam Gerard . These are my deputies . We 're with the UIA . - UIA ? ! - The Underground lntelligence Bureau ... - Association . - You 're not from here . Oh , no . Part of a new experimental group , designed to serve and protect the underworld from outside forces . We fear this is one of our men . What have you got . Sarge ? It 's not good . - Please leave . You 've compromised our level . - Wait . I 've always thought we were fools to think we could stay hidden . We 'd be even bigger fools to think we could protect ourselves against whoever ... or whatever did this . How can we assist you ? OK . Well , first , we need to get these people back . All right ? I need this whole area secured . I need you to dust for prints , get some photos , and , please , start working these people , because maybe , just maybe , somebody saw something . OK ? Get going . You heard her . Let 's let 'em do their jobs . No sign of a voice receptor . The team leader may still be alive . - Know what killed him ? Well , we 've got precision hits to the chest and back , close range . Wait . Each ... Each one of these hits has a twin . - That 's consistent with forearm weapons . - Betrayer . Hel , finding the team leader is still the priority . Right . We 'll split . Sweep the village for survivors . - Well , what about the Betrayer ? - For all we know , - this level could be infested with them . - Well , let 's go waste 'em . No . This started as a rescue mission , and it 's gonna stay that way . Cleo , you 're with me . OK , I 'll be back for a full report . This ASE place is way too convincing . You can 't tell me these aren 't real . See for yourself . Holograms . All of them . Come on . Dance music I don 't believe this . DANCE TEACHER : To the side . That 's it Come on , kids . Wow ! You guys have this dance too ? DANCE TEACHER : Awesome . How did I not know the one thing to survive the obliteration of mankind would be the Macarena ? Com-Yoppa Com-Yoppa Hel-lo ! - It 's called the Com-Yoppa . - Com-Yoppa ? Yeah . And I didn 't get it either , the first time . Till my dad taught me how . Then let 's Com-Yoppa . Ooh-whoo ! Whoo ! Whoop ! Whoop ! Hi ! What 's your name ? - Alexa . - Oh , well , I 'm Cleopatra , and that 's Helen . - Hi . - Wow , I like your shoes . Thanks . My daddy brought them back from his long trip . Well , they were definitely worth the wait . Helen , did you see these ? So , what 's the secret ? Gonna show me your steps ? I thought maybe you were the one who was going to show us . Oh , no , no , no , no . I 'm not the expert . Actually , your expert 's right here . Helen ? This isn 't part of the mission . Fine . You 've got that set for Betrayer . Well , I 'm not a Betrayer . I guess you 're not , either . Hel , I found the team leader . Good , we 're on our way . I figure the Betrayer made us when it saw Jace adjusting my Voice receptor . It 's completely fried now . We 've fixed the easy stuff , but he still has serious injuries . Get him to a healing tube , right ? Four years ! That 's how long my team was together . The Betrayer changed all that in about four seconds . - Look er ... - Xev . Right . Er ... Voice instructed us to ... - To give me a full recharge . - No , to get you off this level as soon as possible . We 'll get your report once Mauser gives you a clean bill of health . I 'm not leaving . I 've got a Betrayer to attend to . But thanks for patching me up . Wait . You mean you know where the Betrayer is ? Com-Yoppa It was too dark to tell for sure . But I 've narrowed it down to three choices . - Where did all this happen ? - In their back yard . Well , three 's a bit messy , - but at least we cover ourselves . - Are you out of your mind ? You figure we follow them home , do it there ? It 's Alexa 's father . Remember her dancing shoes ? Daddy brought them home from his long trip . Well , Daddy 's going away for good this time . Com-Yoppa Voice , we 've ID 'd the Betrayer . Tell the Voice , with our combined fire power , we can get rid of that thing right now . GetXev to safety Hel - We 're taking you out of here . - What ? ! - I 'm not going anywhere . You 're injured . This isn 't open for debate . But you 're open for running away ? - I 'm open for taking this Betrayer out right now . - And taking away Alexa 's father ? She has a point . I don 't believe this . Look , he may be a ruthless killing machine around you , but look at him . Look at them . He 's still the daddy that that little girl has always known . The Bailies have made them near-perfect . All the emotions , all the feelings from the original human specimens remain intact . Hel ! Alexa 's real father , who he was , what he was , - chances are , he 's already ... - He 's already dead ! Do you understand that ? Yes , I understand that . But our directive remains the same , which doesn 't include calling any more attention to ourselves than is necessary . We 're leaving . - What ... ? - Xev ! - Hey ! Where 's he going ? - Son of a ... Hel , you need backup ! - When can we dance again , Daddy ? - Any time , sweetie . Any time . DANA : Nole ? Remember me ? Who are you ? This is a friend , Alexa . Look , why don 't you go back to the park with Mommy , OK ? - Nole , what 's ... ? - Dana , please . Everything 's all right Just take Alexa back to the park . I won 't be long . I promise . What 's wrong , Betrayer ? Bailies accidentally drop a little fear inside you ? The Voice and those who follow it are the true Betrayers . Please ! Don 't ! Don 't . I am still Nole . I still feel his love , my love , for my family . Help me . Help me remove the instinct . The instinct to destroy me ? Please . Tell me it 's possible . It 's not . You could leave me . Yes , just walk away . Yes , you see ? There 's always ... other options . Here 's an option for you . Are you OK ? Yeah . Com-Yoppa Alexa , are you OK ? Hm ? Alexa , honey , why don 't you try and dance ? I don 't want to . Dana , I ... I just wanted to check in and ... and ... Please , Helen , you don 't have to try and explain it again . You did what you had to do . You opened our eyes down here . But that won 't bring Nole back . We 'll be fine , Helen . Just not tomorrow . Dana ... I know what it 's like to lose a father . And what she needs now is for you to just love her . And for you both to remember her father for the wonderful man that he was . What do you say , honey ? You wanna go home ? - OK . - Come on . Next week : 109 Perceptions

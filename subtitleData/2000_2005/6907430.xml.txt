 I 'm alive , although I should have died . Yes . How is Kyoichi doing ? He 's absent from school today , but Mr. Moriguchi said he 's fine . I see ... There are currently very few Protectors left to fight . Yes . I didn 't want to pass everything down to you in this kind of shape , but ... I have been prepared . You 've become strong . It seems as though you are standing in a place far beyond where I am . From this moment on , you are the Master of the Tenmo Style . Yes . It 's a magnificent view , don 't you think ? Were you shocked by the hospital room ? Of course I was . It looked like a bunch of coffins were lined up . While we were having fun with the Cultural Festival and school , I knew there were people , like Harumi 's father , fighting and getting hurt to protect us . I knew that , but ... But ... you 're glad you came , right ? I wonder if it was okay to bring them here . Baku insisted I bring them and show them , but I think the two of them are shocked . It 's better to know than to be left in the dark . Do you think so ? I think so . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Record of the School Wars : MURYOU I looked up at the sky ...

The closing speech was especially good . I moved to this town four years ago and I 'm getting along great with everyone . Right now , the whole school is getting worked up for the upcoming Cultural Festival . Why don 't we start a festival together ? The native Tenmo kids and the new Tenmo kids , as people who love this town let 's start a new festival together . I thought I sounded kind of full of it . I got a long lecture from Futaba afterwards . That 's not true . I thought you were great because you sounded so natural . My grandfather was saying that he 'd like to sit down and have a talk with you sometime . Uh-oh . Morning everyone ! Morning ! Morning ! W ... What 's going on ? Hey ! Guys ? Sorry , Hajime ! They just want to talk . Just listen to what they have to say . A talk ? But - That 's right . I only want to have a talk . It 's fall already ... Fall ? Fall as in , the season ? Yes , fall when the sports clubs have their district competitions . That 's right ! That 's right ! That is why Muryou , we have a favor to ask you . Didn 't I already decline to join the club ? Indeed ! We had given up recruiting you when you took the job as rep for the Athletic and Cultural Festivals . But ... ! What do you say to being a temporary member forjust one day ? A temporary member ? But the Festival Club is ... I know , we 're not going to be unreasonable . We 've given up on asking you to join all the clubs , for now ... reluctantly ... Reluctantly ! Reluctantly ! Why , thanks . Muryou ! So after a strict lottery we , the Judo Club , have won the right to have Muryou as our temporary member ! Congratulations ! Congratulations ! Congratulations ! Congratulations ! Congratulations ... That 's great , but ... You guys are getting worked up without asking him . That 's unfair . You have an obligation to do it . I really didn 't want to bring this up but you ate the food we gave you the other day , right ? You ate it , right ? Well , yeah ... You ate it , right ? The food that they 're referring to is the food given to Muryou by all the sports club presidents , the day after he collapsed . Then Setsuna , who appeared out of nowhere , took charge , planned a party , and the food was all gone . Let 's get this party started ! Woo-Hoo ! Eat up , everyone ! Time to eat ! Time to eat ! We found out the story about you working a part-time job to support your sick grandfather was just a joke that Shun Morihata told us ... But ... You ate it , right ? Well ... You ate our sincerity , right ? Well ... You ate it , right ? Fine , I 'll do it . We did it ! We did it ! Oh man ... That was really intense ... Th ... Th ... Th ... Thank y ... Thank ... Muryou . I really didn 't have a choice . Hey ! Hey ! Did you hear ? Oh that ? The " Muryou Subaru ! The Judo Helper ! " news had spread across the entire school instantaneously . And he agreed to do it ! It 's really happening ? Indeed it is ! So everyone , come and cheer us on ! Maybe I 'll go cheer for him . But it 's judo ! But I 'll get to see Muryou in an outfit besides his school uniform ! Hi ! Let 's get to today 's big news right away ! Previously ignoring the pushy recruitment by the sports clubs ... Muryou Subaru To Attend Competition Meet ! Previously ignoring the pushy recruitment by the sports clubs ... Muryou Subaru To Attend Competition Meet ! Muryou Subaru To Attend Competition Meet ! ... Muryou Subaru from 2nd year Homeroom C ... Muryou Subaru To Attend Competition Meet ! ... has finally agreed to become a helper for the Judo Club ! He will be at the competition meet facing off against our rival , Miyanomori Middle School ! According to Nozomi Shimoyama , the president of the Judo Club ... Quote , " Cheers are very much welcomed , " end-of-quote ! If you 're interested , head to the Mischu gymnasium in ten days at 2 P.M. ! Wow , Muryou has finally given in ! What are you talking about ? It 's basically your fault for lying to the sports club presidents . But hey , don 't you want to see Muryou 's sharp skills too ? Well yeah , if you put it that way ... Of course , you 'll go cheer for him right ? I 'm not going . Whatever you say ! I 've been asked to help too . With judo ? No . With basketball , softball and track . Why should I go cheer for him ? Nayuta , you 're awfully depressed today . What 's the matter ? The fact that she 's the troubled heroine ... That 's what 's the matter . I see ... So how was the Galactic Federation 's spaceship ? H ... How did you know ? You idiot ! Nayuta ! Setsuna told me all about it . Setsuna is such a blabber-mouth ... I was going to find out anyway , sooner or later . Plus , Lady Momoe is already aware that your father and Kyoichi 's father are up to something . Mineo 's father fought for us ... And so did the other Protectors . It 's true that our lives , the lives of the Chosen , are built upon sacrifices made by a lot of various people . That 's why we have to keep on smiling . Nothing is going to change by being depressed . Think about what you have to do for everyone 's future . What I have to do ... That is our duty . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Off I go ! Wait a minute , Hajime ! Hajime , wait for her ! But , she 's embarrassing . What 's so embarrassing ? Everything about you is . What did you say ? Okay . You 're all set . I 'll make sure to cheer for the both of us ! Yes , please , and tell Muryou I said " Hi " . Sure . Bye ! Off I go ! Hey , wait ! What about this ? Oh , that 's right ! Good Luck Muryou Good grief ... Oh , whatever ... Hajime , and then ... Today 's cheer ... Hajime , and then ... Today 's cheer ... Let me explain the details of today 's competition meet . Let me explain the details of today 's competition meet . There are two middle schools in Tenmo . One is our Misumaru Middle School and the other is Miyanomori Middle School . The judo clubs have had competitive meets in the fall separate from the district competition . The win-loss count from the past ten years have been four to six for Mischu . I can definitely understand why Nozomi Shimomura , the Judo Club president , is so hung up on Muryou . Futaba ! Futaba ! Hi ! Tenmo District Middle School Fall Season Judo Competition Good luck ! Miyan omori Middle School Judo Club Let 's do a cheer to hope we see an exciting match by Muryou Subaru ! Yeah . Yeah . No ! You 're not loud enough ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Setsuna ... When did she show up ? Hey , you guys ! Never mind the greeting ! This is all your fault , Setsuna . Huh ? What is ? Muryou was blackmailed because of the party the other day ... I feel so sorry for him . Because of the party the other day ? What did you guys do ? No , the party we had with you was used as blackmail against him . What are you guys talking about ? Blackmail ? You guys aren 't making any sense ! Anyway , let 's all cheer and show our support ! Muryou ! Hey ! You 're looking sharp . Thanks . It 's a sick joke that you 're wearing a white belt . You think so ? Thanks to you , the gymnasium is packed with people . It 's nuts in there and things haven 't even started . Okay ! So , " Fight ! Fight ! Muryou-O ! " is what we 're going to say . What about cheers for the other people ? We should say " good luck " at least , right ? Okay ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Um , are you sure ? We 're the opposing school . What are you talking about ? Competition matches are fun because of the cheers by opposing teams ! Let 's go ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Basically , she 's having fun with the situation we 're in . I bet she had ulterior motives for putting on the party . Yup . Yup . I 'm sure she 's not doing it to offend anyone . Don 't mind her . I don 't mind her , but if anyone , you 're the one that should be upset about it . Oh , you 're right . Muryou ! Yes ? I have new information ! Apparently , Miyanomori has an alarmingly strong helper too ! Miyanomori has one too ? That 's right ! They 're the same . Hey Mitsuru . The day has finally come when I get to see you cry ! You 're going to be the one crying again this year ! We have a secret weapon ! You asked a white belt amateur ? Well , keep gloating while you can ! Who is he ? He 's the Judo Club president at Miyanomori and ... My cousin ! Makes sense . I 'm not gonna lose ! We 're going to win this year ! We 're definitely going to win ! Muryou Muryou Muryou ! Begin ! Go Kaikei ! Keep him busy ! Offense ! Offense ! The competition has begun . I 'd like to say we were seeing amazing techniques , but both Mischu and Miyanomori always lose on their first match at the prefecture tournaments . To be brutally honest , both teams suck . A series of unexpected results and unexpected winning techniques . That itself was entertaining . Ippon ! Osaekomi ! Ippon ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Fourth Match ! Athletes , step onto the mat ! Easy win ! Easy win ! Finish him off with an lppon ! Fourth Match Kanata M youken Fourth Match Kanata M youken I was worried about him being the secret weapon ... Fourth Match Kanata M youken Fourth Match Kanata M youken ... but he looks like he 's just filling in for the team . ... but he looks like he 's just filling in for the team . We 're two-to-one right now . I feel bad about Muryou but I 'm going to end it with this match . Begin ! Ippon ! Fifth Match ! Athletes , step onto the mat ! Muryou ! Muryou , good luck ! Muryou , good luck ! All right ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! Go ! Miyanomori ! The Miyanomori helper ... Who is he ? Sticking to your guns , I see . Sh ... Shun ! The match is two-to-two . The Fifth Match will be the deciding factor . Okay ! Nozomi , you 're a fool . You rushed the match . All that 's left is this white belt , filling in for the team . This year 's competition victory will be the Miyanomori Judo Club 's ! Begin ! Ippon ! Versus Match , three-to-two ! Misumaru Middle School wins ! We did it ! Damn ... All right ! Camera ! Camera ! Yes ! How was it , being a helper ? Well , I 'm glad that my opponent fell on his own when I opened my body slightly . All right ! We did it , Mischu ! We won , Mischu ! Listen Mitsuru ! Victory is mine today , but ... ! You and I didn 't have our match ! We 'll settle this in high school ! Just bring it ! All right , fine ! You better prepare yourself ! How ridiculous is this ? " Victory is mine " ? He 's the one who lost . I think being ridiculous is fine by them . Very impressive . Mineo 's daughter ... I 'd like to see him fight Harumi . I see . Huh ? Moriyama , I didn 't know you were here . I stopped by because the game ended . You know , the track field is right there so ... I heard you were helping out three clubs simultaneously ! That 's amazing ! Yes , well ... Misumaru Middle School Yes , well ... Misumaru Middle School Misumaru Middle School Have you seen Muryou ? He disappeared somewhere . Muryou ? Muryou ? Huh ? Where did Myouken go ? He was just here but ... Were you after me ? Yes . I thought you 'd be in the Fourth Match , but I guessed wrong . Well , in a Versus Match you have to prioritize to win each match . Sorry about that . I came because I heard the Galactic Federation had hid something significant on Earth . Oh ? Is it you ? You 're wrong about that . But you 're strong , right ? I wonder ? Let 's not today . Yeah . I hope to see you again sometime soon . My name is Kanata Myouken . I know . Your name was written on the opponents chart . Well , if you 'll excuse me . Miss ! Thank you for cheering for me ! Gulp ! Oh my . He 's gone already . That boy knows how to move fast , too . Is he an enemy ? We can say for sure he 's not our friend . Yeah . Another mysterious person has appeared . Kanata Myouken . Who is he exactly ? But for now , as we celebrate the Judo Club 's victory , it 's going to be continued in the next episode . To be continued Next Episode I 'm Hajime Murata . Muryou 's amazing match is what everyone at school is talking about . It made the front page and Hikaru featured it on the school news broadcast . It 's pretty hectic .

" no , i said ' posse ! ' " oh , oh , i think i see somethin ' edible . is it a pizza ? mushrooms ! yo , hey , man , you can 't just go picking ' those things . why not ? 'cause if you get the wrong kind , they 'll kill ya . i know my mushrooms . trust me . no way. if you know the difference between good ones and poisonous ones , you 're straight . then how do you tell the difference ? the poisonous ones 'll kill ya . mmm. mmm , mmm , mmm . oh , come on , you know you 're hungry . come on . yeah , i 'm not hungry enough for my last meal . now you don 't see me dropping dead , do you ? ask me again in about an hour . you feel a little weird ? no . i feel a lot weird . you know how you stare into the fire and see things ? birds , big-ass birds . buffaloes . swooping down , picking up a shepherd . cowboy-pirate , riding a buffalo , rearing ' up ... wavin ' a- - waving ' a fur ... sombrero . the shep-shepherd 's changin ' legs . go--go with the blue ones , dude. they match your eyes . i 'm goin ' off the board for 500 here , jack . give the man a toaster ! i see an iguana in lederhosen . you see what i see ? flying hedge trimmers . where ? it 's here , man . it 's not like they 're hidin ' it right next to the wind-up dancin ' teeth . dancin ' the limbo . you made a good fire , man . i did , didn 't i ? you made a good fire . kurdy , wake up . w-what ? an elephant just woke me up . well , an asshole just woke me up . i 'm serious , man . yeah , so am i . dear dad , it 's been 15 years since the big death wiped out everyone over the age of innocence ... the end of your world , the beginning of mine . oh. you know what the worst part of it all is ? you mean me puking my guts out back there for 20 minutes wasn 't the worst part ? no , lee chen warning us that it was a setup . you hear somethin ' ? just my stomach flippin ' over again . down , big fellow . no , music . oh . it 's got to be the inn theo told us about . it could still be a setup . well , hello there . theo sent us . i know . we 've been expecting you . come . lee chen , eat your heart out . won 't make for much of a meal . welcome to the lithia inn . i 'm patrick desault , proprietor extraordinaire , if i do say so myself . i 'm kurdy . jeremiah . i , uh , love what you 've done with the place . oh , you 've been here before ? no , i just love what you 've done with the place . theo said i should give you the royal treatment . oh , and , uh , what might that be ? i told you it was a setup . fuck . back in your pants , boys . it was theo 's idea . she said she wished she could see the expression on your faces . yeah , that theo . what a kidder . anyway , she 's picking up the tab , so , everything , everything , everything ... is on the house . but first things first . you gentlemen hungry ? we make a mean mushroom omelet . no . mmm . kurdy ? i think that we have died and gone to heaven . yeah , you got that right , jack . no , i 'm serious . i mean , the poison mushrooms . does this bear any resemblance to reality to you ? no , not exactly , but i am not mad . and then there was the elephant . hey , i didn 't see an elephant . you saw the elephant , maybe you just died . pinch me . you know , just to make sure . uh , you 've got all these beautiful women around , and you want me to grab your ass ? you are dead . time to choose a girl . assuming that is your particular poison . pity . that 's , uh , quite a likeness . i think i 've captured you . what 's your name ? polly . polly want a cracker ? don 't pay any attention to him. he 's still alive . and what about you , kurdy ? i 'm--i 'm fine . fine isn 't the word . and what might your name be ? cassandra . well , cassandra , i 'm sure you have plenty of other things to do , however- - no , i 'd love to . sorry. she 's taken . well , maybe we should just let the lady decide for herself . i said she 's taken . excuse me . now , now , yarbo . what have i told you about using your words , hmm ? this is not the time or place . you and me , we are not done . ahem . i just love the smell of testosterone in the evening , hmm ? ahem . where are you from , jeremiah ? nowhere . everywhere . i 'm surprised i haven 't met you there . you like working here ? some days better than others . you look like you 'd rather be sailing . it 's just an old bumper sticker . listen , um , polly . mmm-hmm . you--you don 't have to do this if you don 't want to . what makes you think that i don 't want to ? just in case i am dreaming , do me a favor . don 't wake me . if you 'll do the same for me . oh , yeah . we see all kinds in here , believe me . you know what i 'm sayin ' . the minute i laid eyes on you , i knew that you were different . you 've got somethin deep goin ' on . don 't ask me to explain . i--i won 't . am i talking too much ? no . 'cause i 've been accused of that . i mean , elysse says i 'm chronically caffeinated . do you like music ? i love music , any kind of music . not that i get all that much spare time , but when i do , i sing a little . well , not that i 'm all that good , but , uh , people tell me i have a pretty good ear . can you hear me ? what do you mean ? you weren 't sayin ' anything . maybe you weren 't listening . you want me to shut up . is that it ? nope. no , no , no . that 's not it . i just want you to listen , not just to me , but listen to the silence . well , i don 't get it . how can you hear silence ? see--see , that 's just it . y-you have to train yourself . i mean , you have to just shut everything else out of your mind , and focus . well , why would you want me to listen to nothing ? because that 's where everything important is . see , that 's the best music of all : the sound of the sunrise , the wind in the trees , the sound of a man and a woman gazing into each other 's eyes . i think i can hear it . it 's the most beautiful sound i 've ever heard . it almost made me forget . that doesn 't happen very often . so , desault , does he , uh , does he mistreat you ? is he bad to you ? no , not at all . he--he takes really good care of us . we 're well fed , well compensated . he takes care of us in every way . so where does the sadness come from ? the past . i know how that goes . i figured you were battling demons of your own . i think we 've all got things we 're trying to hide . what 's yours ? when i was 16 , i got pregnant . the most beautiful baby you 've ever seen . but i was really young and really confused . i couldn 't handle the thought of being a mother or giving up my freedom . so i gave her up instead ... to her father . it 's haunted me ever since . do you ever wonder what happened to them ? less than a week ago , a traveler came through here . we got to talking . i found out that gregory and carrie are in coeur d 'alene , just over the river . well , do you ever think about going to see them ? actually , i 've done nothing but think about it . so what 's stopping you ? we 're not allowed to leave this place . unless ... unless what ? unless we win our freedom . and you win your freedom how ? i can 't . but maybe you can . and i would do this how ? by fighting for it and winning . no , you listen to me . i know you want a piece of this kurdy , but his partner is the challenger . you settle your personal stuff on your own time . right now , you 've got one simple job : break jeremiah in 2 . he 's gonna find out that saving theo 's life comes at a price . so don 't pull any punches. got me ? jeremiah , i can 't let you go through with this . i 'm not doin ' it for me , man . there 's no way i can back out . look , this is for your own good . what is ? all right , come on . come on . ladies and dobermans , we have a last-minute substitution . in the red corner , the challenger , the walking , talking , human experiment in man 's capacity for pain , in his final farewell appearance on planet earth , the human death wish , kurdy malloy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! and just entering the ring , the reigning champion , the bone crusher , the widowmaker , the jackhammer , the patron saint of subdural hematomas , yarbo ! are you sure you don 't want me to forge a note from your chiropractor ? no , it 's too late . just so you know , yarbo 's never been beaten . there 's always a first time . go get him , tiger . any questions ? why aren 't we wearin real gloves ? why ? are your hands cold ? or would that be your feet ? and now i 'll explain the rules for the benefit of our visitor . hmm . oh , there are no rules . best 2 out of 3 rounds , boys . you did good . you took his best , you weathered the storm . you got him on the run . he 's on the ropes . you gotta keep your guard up . he 's strong , but he 's flat-footed . he 's probably got a glass jaw . hell , i bet you could nail him with one good shot . cassandra , honey . yes , darling ? never mind . don 't throw a tantrum . get in there ... finish him . wait . i just realized something . when yarbo makes love , there are some positions he can 't get into . thanks for sharing . no , no. it 's his knee . his right knee , an old training injury . you hit his right knee , he 's toast . his knee , his right knee . kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! kurdy ! the winner and new champion , dirty kurdy ! what about your promise ? seems to me you broke the rules . there are no rules , remember ? unless you want me to bring the audience into it . well , it 's a little unorthodox , but ok . you win one girl 's freedom . knock yourself out . it 's more than he could do . ok , now , i know jeremiah promised polly her freedom , but i think it 's only fair that i offer it to you first . that 's sweet , kurdy , but where would i go ? well , you 'd come with me . my life is here . i 'm happy here . it 's polly that wants to go . thank you . hey . yeah . you 're not , uh , pissed at me , are you ? pissed ? no , kurdy , why would i be pissed ? 'cause you sucker punch me , knock me out , tie my ass up down here ? you know , if you want to keep a guy from going out in traffic , you don 't hit him with a car . you know what i 'm sayin ' ? wow , that guy tagged you pretty hard . yeah , but i won . give me a little krazy glue , i 'll be good as new . thanks , man . if we get a chance , i 'll return the favor sometime . maybe . i still don 't know how to thank you guys . you 've given me hope for the first time in ... i don 't know how long . so what do you think will happen after you , uh , find your daughter ? i 'm hoping that she 'll give me a 2nd chance . she 's what , 8 years old ? just barely . and she 's been with her father the whole time ? her father 's part of a circus troupe . he 's a juggler . they move from town to town , set up their tents , and do shows . do they have animals in this circus , do you know ? like maybe a-an elephant ? would you give it up ? to tell you the truth , i 'm not sure . i didn 't think circuses even existed anymore . there aren 't many , but gregory grew up in that world . his parents were acrobats . after the big death , the children picked up where their parents left off . i met him when his circus came to our town . romance under the big top . for a brief moment , i was convinced that i was in love . but not yet ready to be a mother . not then ... but now , i want that connection . i want that feeling of family . i sure as hell don 't want to spend the rest of my life wondering " what if ? " well , polly , there are 2 other people in the equation right now . i 'm not a fool , jeremiah . when it comes to matters of the heart , i think all of us are fools sometimes . i think about my own mother . i was barely 10 when i lost her . what i wouldn 't give to have her come walking back into my life . well , the only difference is , your mother didn 't choose to abandon you . none of our parents did . i was 16 years old . what kind of a mother would i have made ? it 's--it 's different now . i have so much to give to her . until you get to know this child , you 're gonna be a stranger to her . you think you can deal with that ? i won 't know unless i try . well , i 'll be damned . my heart is racing . i don 't even know what she looks like . that should be easy . if she 's anything like her mother , just look for drop-dead gorgeous . polly ? is that really you ? oh , i don 't believe this . hello , gregory . and you--you 're just as beautiful as ever . these are my friends , jeremiah and kurdy . this is the father of my daughter , gregory . is she here ? that 's her in the hat . that 's--that 's china . look , polly , unfortunately , your timing isn 't the best . everybody here is pretty rattled . we just lost the star of our show . who 's that ? iana , our performing elephant . see that ? they lost an elephant . wait , have you seen her ? is she gray , big , long eyelashes , peanut breath , got a big thing in the front ? you 've seen lana ? where ? where 'd you see her ? ah , a couple of days ago , about 10 miles east of here . you 've got to take me there . she 'll never survive out in the wild . she 's totally domesticated . how 'd you lose an elephant ? 3 nights ago , some bandits came through . they fired some shots and stampeded the animals . we 've been looking for lana ever since . maybe you could visit another time . you should know , gregory , that i 'm not just here for a visit . i want to be a part of my daughter 's life . it 's time that she knows how much she means to me . seems to me , you made that clear when you walked away . that was a long time ago . will you excuse us ? see ? they lost an elephant . i saw an elephant . i 'm not crazy . well , you may have seen an elephant , but not crazy ? you 're pushin ' it . look , i 'd be a liar if i didn 't admit it 's wonderful to see you . but , polly , you--you can 't just waltz back into our lives after all these years and start making claims on my little girl . she 's my little girl , too . i--if you want to see china , talk to her , ok . i can understand your curiosity . curiosity ? she 's my child as much as she is yours . no , no , she 's not . i 've raised her . this community has raised her . we sweated blood to make her who she is . i can appreciate that . i do . it 's just ... you have no idea what it 's been like . i need this , gregory . but your needs aren 't the issue here . it 's china i have to worry about , and for you to suddenly decide to play the good mother , honey , it 's too little , too late . it 's ok . he just needs some time to adjust to the idea . you remember i told you about china 's mom ? is that her ? yeah . listen , i 've got a lead on lana . i 'm gonna see if i can get polly 's friends to drive me there , but i want you both to keep an eye on china . i 'm worried polly might try to do something rash . we won 't let her out of our sight . thanks . right around here . elephant tracks . ah , she 's definitely been by here , and not so long ago . you know , gregory , like i was sayin back there , i mean , i think polly really loves your daughter . she loves the idea of being a mother , that 's obvious . living with that reality is a whole other thing . maybe you both could use a reality check . you know , give her a chance to prove herself . forgive and forget ? i 'm not sayin it 'd be easy. i just- - we must be close . tracks head through that glade . hi , there . hi . do you know who i am ? china ... i 'm your mommy . mommy went to heaven . no , no , that 's--that 's not true . i may not have been around very much , but i 've always cared about you . i 've always loved you . i told you , i don 't have a mom . son of a bitch . come on , move . let 's go ! pull ! damn it ! hey , wait a second . let 's just get a game plan together . we don 't get lana back , that 'll be the last of the circus . we 'll get her back . we 'll get her back . come on , move it . move it ! piece of garbage . china 's a wonderful child . you should be very proud of her . you have any kids ? i guess i feel like china 's one of my own . a lot of us do . so everybody gets to be her mom except for her real mother ? that 's not how it is . in this world , we all just make do . if there 's not enough food , we share . if there 's a stranger out in the cold , we invite him in by the fire . and if a child needs mothering , you reach out to her . that 's all i 'm trying to do . i understand , believe me . then why can 't gregory see it ? i don 't know . maybe he 's afraid . afraid that i 'm going to kidnap her , right ? that 's what you all think ? i think he 's afraid of his own feelings . when you left all those years ago , you should 've seen him , polly . he was inconsolable . oh , please . he spent the better part of a year just looking for you . every stop we made , he put out the word , asked if anyone had seen you . he loved you , polly . for all i know , he still does . come on , move it . go. go ! keep movin ' . pull ! asshole ! i 'll bet you 're pretty good on that thing . nah. i 'm still learning . listen , sweetie , i 'm sorry if i seemed to be pushing you . how come you never wanted to see me ? i did want to see you . you have no idea how much . but i was scared , afraid that you 'd hate me , that it was too late to be a part of your life . does that make any sense ? sorta . when i left you and your daddy , i wasn 't much more than a kid myself . and i was too confused and too upset to be a good mother to you . but now , i think that maybe i could . i don 't think so . i 'm pretty ok with just my dad . maybe i could get a little hug in the meantime ? it 's ok . i have waited 8 years . i can wait a little while longer . man , i gotta admit this circus is amazing . well , it 's only a shadow of what it used to be . even some of those who 've been here since they were little kids have decided to move on . why 's that ? audiences just aren 't there anymore . it 's gettin harder and harder for us to stay afloat . really ? man , i would think people would flock to see a show like this . used to be that way . what 's changed ? the circus is about celebration . it 's about hope . i don 't have to tell you there 's not a lot of hope anymore . yeah . well , i know it 's a long haul for a lot of folks , but the way i see it , people are always lookin ' for hope . they just get discouraged , that 's all . exactly what happened to us . but check it , man . i mean , what you got here is one big old hope machine . i mean , this is all about lifting people 's spirits , man . people need things like this circus as much as they need food or air to breathe . what you gotta do is keep the faith . iana ! whoo ! iana 's home ! sweetie . polly , listen . i-if i said some things to hurt you , i didn 't mean to . i caught you off-guard . i understand . you know , sometimes , i look at china , i see you in her . the eyes , right ? i was thinking more the stubbornness . she 's pretty headstrong . polly , your comin ' back here , i 'm sure it wasn 't easy . i just wanted you to know it says a lot about you . you know , the guy i used to work for all these years , he was kind of a showman type himself . i drew posters for him , and he said that it really helped draw in an audience for his fights . maybe the circus could use that kind of promotion . we could use somethin ' , that 's for damn sure . as--as far as china goes , though , i--i still can 't make any real promises . i 'm not asking for any . at least it 'll give the two of you ... the three of us , a chance to get reacquainted . i 'd like that . dear dad , today took me back to one incredible afternoon when i was 5 , maybe 6 , and you and i went to the circus . i thought you were doing it just for me , but then i looked up and saw your face . today made me realize that even after everything we 've been through , the joys we experience as children can live as long as we do .

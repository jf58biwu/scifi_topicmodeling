 Here you go , my friend . Make sure you go as close as you can , l`ll get you something extra if you make it a good trip . l`m going to get you close , my friend . But not too close . You know What I mean ? Are you ready ? - Ready ! - Ready ! 1 , 2 , 3 ! Are you scared ? This is great ! You see anything yet ? No ... Not yet . What Was that ? I don`t know . - Hold on . - What`s happening ? Hold on . Make it stop . What happen to them ? I don`t know . - We`re gonna crash . - No , We are not . We`re gonna crash . l`m going to take this tools . Let go the rope . Let go the rope ! Move your hands . Come on . Keep ... Let go ! lt`s gonna be okay . Actually Charlie that doesn`t hurt . They Won`t really be fighting each other . But these one here are Corythosaurus . They really like fighting With each other . They use their teeth and their claws to rip each other`s jaws out . Alan , he`s three . Let`s Wait until he is five . Right . Sorry , Charlie . - Ellie . - Yes . lt`s Tom again . He says he has to talk to you about the last chapter . Just tell him I am not gonna to lose the Jack Corner Club . Hey , look Who`s here ? This is Alan . Nice to meet you , Alan . Daddy . This is Hylaeosaurus . That`s the dinosaur man . Dinosaur man ? Jack , say my name . is my name Alan ? is my name Alan ? He used to know me . Here you go . Thanks . So you know Mark is going to Work With the State Department now . What do you do , Mark ? lt`s international relation most . Somethings like that . l`ll get her . You guys ... You guys have a little chat . He`s a great guy . So What are you Working on now ? Raptors mostly . My favourite . Do you remember the sounds they made ? I try not . Ellie , all the theories are about raptors intelligence , What are they capable of ? We Work even close . Tell me . We did plenty of scan on the raptors skeleton . We find out it looks like a very sophisticated resonating chamber . Wait a second . So We Were right ? I mean they had even living vocalise . l`m convince they had the key of social intelligence . Which explains Why they Work together as a team . And co-ordinate they attacks . And they probably know What is going on . They could talk to each other . To agree , We could never imagine . Ellie , they Were smart . They Were smarter than dolphins or Whales . They Were smarter than primates . I just Want to say l`ll be ready to help With anything . Someday if you Want to ask , you can call me . Anything . Anytime . Sure . You`re still the best . I mean it . The last in my breed . So the basic study about the interior chamber , and most of these specimens . They begin to determine the exciting color relation between the upper-pales and the leerings . This lead us theorise the raptors . Which are capable of sophisticated vocalizations Which Were had been tremendous evolutionary advantange . Raptors Were fierce , intelligent and socially sophisticated . They Were able to hunt in numbers and co-ordinate their efforts . With the catadysmic advance Which overtook them it`s entirely possible that raptors or humans Whether to become a dominant species on this planet . I hope this has been interest . It certainly excites us as it`s intelligence . There is much more to discover . That is Why We continue to need and ask for your support . Thank you . Thank you very much , Dr Grant . now , does anyone have a question ? Fine . Does anyone have a question that is not related to Jurrasic Park ? All the incident in San Diego Which I did not Witness . Yes , sir . Your theory on raptors is good . But isn`t it a conjecture kind of mood ? I mean once the UN in Costa Rica and everyone decides how to handle that second island , scientists Will just go in and look for themselves . Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago . What is left of them is fossilise in the rocks . And this in the rock , that real scientists make real discovery . now What John Hammand and lngen in the Jurassic Park is created genetically engineered theme park monsters . Nothing more and nothing less . Are you saying that you don`t Want to get to Isla Sorna and study them if you have the chance ? No force on earth or heaven . Forget beyond that island . So What We got here ? 20 million gas operator sending out in a minute . Gunship , magazine , third routine and both our clothes cope With reducing muscles ... Here , Udesky . Yes , sir . We are going to get here . The matter of fact is you knock things down as soon as you bought me that thing . Well , that`s right . There are two of the best man that I Would find . No , sir . l`ve not Worked With them personally . But believe me , sir . These men come very highly recommended . Nothing to Worry about , sir . lt`s going to be Walk in park . Billy , I don`t think that l`m doing this right . Let`s try to do first . You got to do this slowly . lt`ll just take a little bit of time . I can never tell What`s rock and What`s bone . Technically it`s all rock . But calcium in the bones replace during fossilisation . You can feel the difference , see . Rough ... smooth ... Rough ... smooth ... Dr Grant ! Mr Brennan . So how did it go ? lt`s not too late to change your major , Billy ! Worse , We gonna have backup in four Weeks . I have to run some equipment . I got to show you something . You like computers , right I like the abacus , Billy . Meet the future of paleontology . lt`s a rapid photo type . I scanned them from the raptor skeleton . If the computer breaks down a thousand of slices . And this thing scoops it . One layer at a time . lt`s done . I give you the resonating chamber of velociraptor . Listen to this . This is brilliant , Billy . All I have to say , it`s just a little bit too late . Grant , Paul Kirby . Kirby Enteprise . My card . how are you doing , Billy . ? What can I do for you , Mr Kirby ? Well , the first thing , l`m a great admirer of yours . And I have a proposition and I Would like to discuss With you . Would you have dinner With me and my Wife this evening ? lt`ll be our treat . That Will be great , but ... l`m tired , I have been travelling . Maybe some other time . Believe me . This Will be Worth you a While . We love to . Terrific . That`s the spirit . Good . See you this evening then . - Billy . - how are you ? So What are you boys drinking ? - Ice peak cap . - two please . We admire your Work for years . Really truly inspiring . Amanda and I just love the outdoors . We have been on just every adventure that can come up With . The Neil and everything . We even have two seats reserved on the first commercial flight to the moon . And for the Wedding anniversary this year , We like to do something really special ... - Something ... - Once in a lifetime . l`ve charged an airplane to fly us Isla Sorna . And We like you to be our guide . There you go , guys . This is a very kind offer , Mr Kirby . l`m a very very busy man . I can recommend a couple of guys Who is highly qualified that ... No . No . You are the best . You`d seen these animals in the flash . There is even one comes close to you . You Won`t be able to fly enough low to see anything that is really interesting . That`s the interesting part . Because We have the permission to fly low . how low ? Haven`t issue yet . But I can fly lower than anybody else . I can tell you . From What I understand , I understand ... This is What We Want . You see , through my business dealing , import and export . Emerging market . I have a lot of friends in high level . In that case , Costa Rica We can go in . Dr Grant , you have no idea how this important to us that you come along . This Will be all the difference . Mrs Kirby , I ... And of course We love to make a contribution to your research here . I can Write all kind of numbers on this check , Dr Grant . Tell me . What`s this gonna take ? No Way . This one is lucky . A couples years ago , some parties in lsland hand gladding these cleaves in museum . And it`s big up draught come in and swipe me right across the sign . Wham ! Well , it does sound like . This strap saved my life . I got hook on the rock When I Was falling . Survivor are the most idiotic . Alan , thank you for bringing me along . The bones Will still be there When you get back . This is the great thing about bones that they don`t run away . The truth is , you got me into this . l`ve no intention of being on my oWn With these people . Don`t get too excited , Billy . Chances are once here think . Good time to be nice . awake me When We get there . So how do you know the Kirbys ? Through our church . Ellie ... Ellie ! Here We go , We`re almost there . You`re approaching Isla Sorna . Do you Want to approach ... My God. l`ve forgotten . We did it , honey . We are here . If you see anything , yell up . I thought of keep it to myself . l`m sorry . Everyone , if you could look out the left of the plane . You can see a Whole curf of Brachiosaurus . In fact you could see the front of the group alpha male grazing there . Udesky , Nash . how about the front ? You guys see anything ? Nothing yet , Mr Kirby . Mrs Kirby , look . Out here you`ll see a group of Triceratops ... Mr. Kirby , We have to land in strip down ahead . You Want me to put it down ? No . No . I told you on a circle to see the Whole island . You have been set down . We can`t land here . What are you talking about ? - Hold on , I can explain . - You cannot land on this island . lt`s gonna be fine . Everybody sit down . Would you please sit down ... Tell me We didn`t land . I think they are looking for someone . Dr Grant , are you alright ? l`m sorry We have to be so ... Who hit me ? That Will be cooper . What are they doing ? They are setting up a parameter . Then We could play safe . These guys are good . Trust me. ln this island , there is no such thing as safe . We must get back to that plane . Could you ask your Wife stop making up that noise ? That is a very , very bad idea . Amanda ! Ben ! Amanda , honey , Dr Grant says that is a bad idea . What ? He says it`s a bad idea ! What`s about idea ? What Was that ? lt`s a tyrannosaurus . I don`t think so . It sounds bigger . We have to leave . We have to leave now ! What`s going on ? Where is the professional Who can handle this ? lt`s alright . We`re just circled the island . Stop ! What is he doing ? That`s Cooper . Stop ... No one can stop this plane . Are you okay ? We`re okay up here . Everyone just stay put . Mayday ! Mayday ! Who has a satellite phone ? I do . I got it right here . Come and get it . The radio is gone . We haven`t landed yet . Damn it . " The number you call is busy " . What Was that ? What is it ? What ? - What ... - Hold it ! Hang on , everyone . Help me ! Mrs Kirby , come back ! Amanda ! follow me ! In here ! I think We lost him . lt`s okay. lt`s dead . Nobody move a muscle . No ... No ... No ... Please don`t . Stop . Please . lt`s time you do some explain , Mr Kirby . We called everyone . We did verything We could . No one Would help us . The Costa Rica goverment said this is no fly zone . The US embassy ... That`s our US embassy told We should accept the fact . Can you believe that ? You left a 12 year-old go para-sailing alone ? No ! He Wasn`t alone . He Was With a friend . Ben Hilderban . Paul and I divorced over a year ago . So Why me ? He said We needed someone Who had been on island before ? Yes . But I did not tell you to kidnap somebody . I have never been on this island . Sure you have . You Wrote that book . That is Isla Nublar . This is Isla Sorna . You mean there are two islands With dinosaurs ? You stay out of this . So how long have he been missing ? - 8 Weeks . - Almost 8 Weeks . Billy , now go back to plane and set a camp . And We make for the coast . Dr Grant , We are not leaving this island Without our son . You can go on and look for him . Or you can stick With us as long as you don`t hold us up . Either Way , you probably Won`t get out of this island alive . So ? What do We do ? Go and search for your son . That`s the direction they are going . That`s the one . Excellent . Oh , sorry . Sorry . lt`s nothing you haven`t seen before . how much Weight did you lose ? About 25 pounds ! l`ve been swimming . I hate to swim . And I don`t even know how to swim . I learned . - You look good . - So are you . how Would you classify , Billy ? lt`s a super predator . Suchominus . I think bigger . Baryonyx ? Not on that cell . Spinosaurus stick up With this . I don`t remember that on lngen`s list . Because it Wasn`t on there , unless it makes them Wonder What they are up to . So , Mr Kirby , tell me . When you climbed K2 , did you based camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet ? 30,000 feet . We Were pretty close to the top . It is above 30,000 feet , actually . No . No . That`s a common mistake . Mr Kirby , there is no such thing as Kirby Enterprise , isn`t ? There`s Kirby Painting Tile and Plus . The Plus stands for bathroom fixtures . We`re in the West Case Shopping Centre ... I suppose We don`t check you out or anything ... now , listen to me . l`ll pay you the money ... - This is good . - No matter What . We are in Worst place on the World , We are not being pay . Alright , now Wait . fellows , hold on . l`ll make this up to you . If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen ... You are not really a mercenary , are you ? I never said I Was . That`s true . What are you ? l`m like a booking agent . Guys Who got sick count on me . Here . See We are now in a hardware store . Pay in title , yeah . You never can tell about people , do you ? You get the truth . Eric ! Quiet . Would you stop that ? Dr Grant said this is a very dangerous territory . Look . Maybe We should split up or something , you know ? We could cover twice as much of the island . Dr Grant says that is a bad idea . Dr Grant ... Dr Grant says this ... What`s the good of hiring an expert if We are not going to use his advice . Yeah . Except Dr Grant isn`t looking for Eric . He is looking for the coast . Okay , fine . Go ahead and scream . And When cry sake plot comes and attacks . Don`t come crying to me . - Not that bad . - What ? - Nothing . - What did you say ? - Nevermind . - What did you say ? If We split up , l`m going along With you guys . - Eric ! - Eric ! - Mrs Kirby . - Eric ! Mrs Kirby ! Mrs Kirby , the chance is our remote . There are still in our resonance . An adult . Hey , guys . That`s my camera . The battery is dead . I got an idea . Let me have the camera . I shot this in the morning he disappeared . He is alive . I know he`s alive . We got to find him . Will We find one of those ? Maybe . Only if cell is not doing . Let`s take it . If We spot a plane , it might be the good Way to get attention . I got it . Okay . Okay ! Mrs Kirby , please ! Okay , you are free . Come back , Mrs Kirby . Amanda , Wait . Amanda . Amanda ? Amanda ... Amanda ! Amanda , stop ... l`m sorry . l`m sorry about Ben . lt`s not Ben , Paul . lt`s Eric . He`s out there all by himself . I know , I know . Our kid is out there all by himself . Listen to me . We`ll find him. I promise . Paul .. Dr Grant ! You should come and look at this ! Raptor . We are going to find him . Are you listening to me ? We are going to find him . This kid got resources . Remember last time We tried to ground him ? Where`s Billy ? What are you doing ? I Was trying to go to the nest . Don`t do that again . l`m sorry . If I lose you , that means you are a damn tourist . I bet they are in there , don`t you think ? I bet my bottom dollar . What you think it is ? That`s ancient . Four seasons . Eric ! Paul , don`t do that ... What the hell ? Who`s got some change ? Let me take some quarters . I got a buck ten ... This is how you make dinosaurs . No . This is how you play God . - That Way ! - Look out . lt`s locked . - This Way ! - Go ! Go ! Hey ! Over here ! Push ! Push ! My God . lt`s calling the other half . Come on ! lt`s in a hurry . Out from the trace . Udesky . Mr Kirby ! Billy ! is Alan With you ? Oh my God ... Mr Udesky ! Mr Udesky ! He`s dead . Oh my God . No , he`s not . - No , he`s not ! - No ... Wait ! Something is not right . Amanda ! Hold on ! Hold on ! They set a trap . Yeah , they set a trap . What do you say ? What do you looking for ? Thanks . Thanks a lot , Eric . You know Who I am ? Yeah , your parents are here . They are looking for you . - Together ? - Together . That`s not good . They don`t take so Well to get together . I think it`s big surprise When people could do in it . When I have to . You are Alan Grant . What are you doing here ? Your parents ... invited me along . I read all of your books . I like the portion more . Before you are on the island . You like dinosaurs back then . Well back then they hadn`t try to eat me then . When I jumped in here , they left a lot of stuff behind . Any Weapons ? No.l just use the gas ... And I appreciate that . Be careful With that T-rexas . Scare some of the small ones away , but attacks the really big one With defend . This is T-rexas ? how do you get it ? You don`t Want to know . Dessert ? Sure . Eric , I have to tell you lost for eight Weeks in this island . is that all has been ? You are alive . That`s the important thing . And thanks to you is one thing We have in common . Did you read Malcom`s book ? Yeah . So ? I don`t knoW. I mean ... lt Was kind of preaching ... And too much chaos . Everthing is chaos . It seem like the guy Was hiding himself . Well that`s two things We have in common . What is it ? Coelophysis . Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! No matter how this turns out it Wasn`t your fault . Eric is always a sorry little kid . always . And he threw someone like Ben Hilderban into the mess ... - Well ... - Well What ? All l`m saying it`s not your fault . No ... If he`d been With you , he`ll be completely safe . You drive 5 miles in every speed limit , Paul . And l`d thrown three cars in three years . Well , not three . The Buek Wasn`t really total . I just said I Was , cause I Wanted get a " Yes , you do " . l`m so sorry that you have to be here . l`m not . There`s a boat lie along side the bank . Looks in good shape . Rescue boat ? No . Someone left behind . Let`s move . Stick to the plan . Head for the coast . You are not going to look for Dr Grant . Heading the coast is Alan`s idea . If he`s alive , there is Where he`s heading . I agree . What about Eric ? Eric is a smart kid . He probably know he stands a best chance by the coast . He figures all the big dinosaurus are in the centre of the island . Right ? Sure . You know What this is ? That`s a raptor claw . I have one . A fossil . Mine is new . how much do you explore ? I stick pretty close to the compound . I think if anyone is looking for me ... There`s Where they started . We need to get to the coast . That Was a plan . Are you sure ? The closer you get to the Water , the bigger the things get . We have to find a Way to the canyon to find a river out to the coast . After We find your parents . And then What ? One step to the time . Listen . What ? That`s my dad satellite phone . how do you know ? Kirby Painting Tile and Plus . Dad ! - Eric ! - Eric ! Eric ! This Way ! Eric ! Mom ! Dad ! Eric ! Mom ! Dad ! I know it . Oh my God . I know it . Oh my God . Oh , l`m glad to see you . Hey , you got my beg . Yeah , lucky strap . Want me to carry it ? Need to find a gap here . how did you know We Were here ? The phone . The stupid jingle from the store . I heard it . My phone ? Yeah , your satellite phone . Where is it ? I don`t have it . When did you use it last night ? On the plane . I got a call on the place and ... What ? I loaned it to Nash . He must have had it When he ... Run . Alan , you Wanna give me the bag back . lt`s okay , Billy. I got it . Please give me the bag . lt`s not safe . Raptor`s eggs ? Did you steal raptor`s eggs ? now it all make sense . I swear if I know you`re gonna end up With them . I took them on an impose . I thought that the door With the fortune are enough for the things I obtain 10 more years . But you have to believe me this Was a stupid decision . But I did it With the best intentions . With the best intentions ... Some other Worst things imaginable have been done With the best intentions . Come on , Billy . As far as I concern , you are not better than the people Who built this place . What are you doing ? Those things are after us because of those . Those things know We have the eggs . I drop them into the river . They Will still be after us . What if they catch us With them ? What if they catch us Without them ? There is a boat at the bottom , just down the river . We try to make to the coast , at least . - You`re okay ? - Yeah . Let`s do this one other time , shall We ? Okay , come on over . One other time . Okay , Eric.l`m gonna leave you just for a minute . And then you are going to be right behind me , okay ? Mom , l`ve been alone in the Water truck for eight Weeks . I think I can manage the next few minutes Without you . Right . We are all together now . Okay , Eric . - Come on , honey - You go . Mom ? Oh my God . What is it ? lt`s a bird cage . For What ? Eric ! Eric ! Eric ! I can`t stay Without my kid . Eric ! This Way ! Billy ! Billy , stop . Billy , stop ! Stop , Billy ! Billy ! Eric , hold on ! Eric ! Jump ! Billy ! Look out now ! Eric ! Eric ! There he is ! With the pteranodous . Get him out of there . Go ! Go ! What about Billy ? Hang on , Billy ! Go away ! Go away ! Come on ! lt`s playing the gasoline . now just got to get out to the coast . We got some sort of ... some sort of signal . Build the fire or something . Something that can see from the air . Dr Grant ? Hey , Eric . how are you doing ? l`m sorry about Billy . You know What`s the last thing I said to him Was ? lt`s ... he`s as bad as the people Who built this place . It Wasn`t true . Billy is just young ... that`s all . I have a theory there is two kind of boys . Those Who Want to be astronomers . And those Who Want to be astronauts . The astronomers , the paying intelligence . Get to study this amazing things from a place With complete safety . But he never got to go into space . Exactly . Its the difference between imagining and seeing . Be able to touch them . And ... that`s all Billy Wanted . Dr Grant ... lt is open , Dr Grant . Billy Was right . Listen . Find the phone before it stops ringing . Eric , stand there . - lt`s here - Wait , it`s here . I got it . Hello ? Hello ? " Enjoy your meal in one of our four star restaurant ... " Look out ! Turn off the power . You got to choose for making one call . What do you do ? Don`t call the US embassy . They Won`t do a damn thing . Hey , guys . Come here . Look at this ! What is this ? Something must have spook them . Get the edge of calling , Mr Kirby . Open the plot . Hello ? Ellie ! Hello ? Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie , take the phone to mommy now . lt`s the dinosaur man . Okay . Charlie , are you taking the phone to mom ? Charlie ? Who`s in the phone ? The dinosaur man . He is ? Alan ? - Where`s the phone ? - There . Get the phone . Ellie , listen to me ! Alan , are you on a cell phone ? I can`t hear you . The raptor chases me ... Hello ? Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Paul , you can`t ... You can`t leave me like this . l`m not going anywhere . Dad ! Remember When We Went fishing a couple summers ago ? We putted the boat in the Water and the trailer sank . The toll truck tried to pull us out and they got drag in too . The truck driver Wanted to knock my lights out . I miss fishing . Mr Kirby . That lady you called . Who is she ? how do you know that she can help us ? She is the person I can always count on . I owe her a lot . I don`t think I have ever told her that . You should . You hear that ? The ocean . Pick up your eggs . Everybody get down . She is challenging us . She thinks she stole the eggs . Get behind me . Give me the eggs . Do it , mom . No ... No ... Call for help . That`s a helicopter . Dr Grant ? Dr Alan Grant ? No ! That`s a very bad idea ! You have to thank her now . She`s in the NAVY . God bless you , Ellie . - ls this man With you ? - What ? We made it ... Yeah . I rescue your hat . Give me that . That`s the important thing . Dr Grant ! What the hell is that ? Dr Grant , look ! Where do you think they are going ? I don`t know . Maybe just looking for a new nesting ground . lt`s all in the World for them . how dare them to nest in Olakhoma ? Let`s go home . - THE END -

 Is it just me , or does it seem a little too quiet in here lately ? Having trouble with your new story ? Yeah , writer 's cramp . Make way ! Coming through ! I really should put a window in the lab . It 's much safer ... much safer . There . Does that make your day more interesting ? Yeah ... Too bad Marguerite and Roxton missed all the action . Oh , I don 't think they need Challenger for that . What do he have over here ? That 's an odd looking snare . With a knot like that ... has only one purpose , Marguerite ... it 's a hangman 's noose . John , I don 't like this place . I think we should leave . I don 't like it much either . What have you found over there ? That 's a tombstone ... it has your name on it J. Roxton , died 1875 . 1875 . You don 't think that tombstone has any connection to me ! I mean J. Roxton it 's not that uncommon a name ... well hell it could stand for ... Joshua ... - Jacob ... - Jeremy Roxton ... You 've been found guilty , of being the wrong man in the wrong place at decidedly the wrong time . Challenger ! What are you doing ? What 's going on ? Where 's Marguerite ? This is a necktie party , Roxton , and you 're the guest of honor . Please it 's me , John ! May the Lord have mercy on your soul . - Do it ! - No ! Yiah ! Enough , come on boys there 's no point in wasting a good horse . At the dawn of the last century ... A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World - Uh . - Oh ! no , no . Careful , careful , careful now . Marguerite , thank God ! Where 's you go ? What happened ? I was going to ask you the same thing , mister . Mister ! Are you all right ? Tell me you know who I am ! My name is Maylene Montgomery . And ... I 'm sure I 've never had the pleasure of your acquaintance . Oh . No . It must be this tree ... or the tombstone ... Or this , this ... ! yes ... or this noose . Having had your neck stretched like that , I 'd say ... it 's no wonder you are a little confused ... Confused ! If you think your name 's Maylene , believe me I 'm not the one confused around here ! There 's been a lot of rustlers in these parts . Is that who you think did this to you ? No . For some reason , it was your good friend and mine , Challenger . - Jack Challenger ? The sheriff ? - No , George Challenger , the scientist . There 's only on Challenger around her . And he 's the law . I don 't know why he would hang you without a trial , and I don 't want to know . So you just go on your way , and I 'll go mine . Oh no , wait just ... wait a minute . We can 't just split up . We have to figure out what happened to us here ! That 's your concern , mister , not mine . There you go again ! It 's not mister , it 's Roxton ! John Bloody Roxton ! Why did you have to go and do that ! The things I get myself into ! Howdy boys ! Is that piano music I heard ? No , sir , Johnny . I know how you don 't like piano music in here ... - What did you call me ? - Uh ... Ringo . Mister Ringo ... sir ! That 's what I thought you said Ante up , boys . Don 't let me spoil your fun . Mighty kind of you , friend . Barkeep ! How about a little service ? I heard you were dead . I heard a lot of things about you , too , Violet . You must be crazy to come back here . You know , the last person that called me crazy died , with three bullets in his chest . I hate piano music . You 're so bad for business . But I 'm good for so many other things . Oh , none that I can recall . I came to pay my tab . Who 'd you have to kill for that , Johnny ? Well , haven 't you heard ? A lot of rustling in these parts . What kind of fix are you and Sheriff Challenger working now ? Same old same old I 'm doing all the hard work , and he just keeps a low profile . At his camp upriver . Shh , that 's strictly confidential . See , we 're not so different after all ? Where am I ? Why you 're in the grand guest lodge of the Triple-M ranch . How did I get here ? Oh you walked some , and I carried you some . You carried me ... ? I couldn 't very well leave you for the coyotes . No ... thank you . So , why is it called the Triple-M ? It was my husband 's idea . Martin and Maylene Montgomery . - The three M 's . - Your husband ? Yeah . Sorry . Gopher . I wasn 't expecting company . So , Maylene , where do you think this husband of yours is ? Last month Martin went on the cattle drive to Abilene . We needed cash for feed ... but ... the rustlers ... They shot him down in cold blood . Rustlers ? I 'll get you some water . Boys , there 's treachery afoot . And as the law in this territory , I will not let it fester . Spread the word . I want Jeremiah Roxton dead or alive ... Mostly dead . And whatever fool it is that 's helping him . You 've actually seen these places ? New York ... London ... Paris ... I have . And so have you . There 's a big difference between dreams and reality , Lord Roxton . I 'm a rancher 's wife ... a rancher 's widow . These plains are where I 'll live and die . All this other is just ... is just moonbeams and starshine as my Martin used to say . There must be something to make you believe who you really are ! Don 't start that again . Would you stand up please ? Now do you remember ? Widow Montgomery ! Are you home ? It 's Jack Challenger ! He doesn 't remember me anymore than you do . Hello , is anybody there ? Here I am , sheriff Stay out of sight . I 'm sure that whatever happened between you two before was some kind of mistake . At least we agree on something . - Good day to you sheriff . - Good day Widow Montgomery ! I 've just come back to tell you the news . Me and the boys tracked down that rustler that killed your poor Martin . Unfortunately he had help we didn 't know about and he got away . You know who this killer is ? Some greenhorn by the name of Jeremiah Roxton . Oh , this just keeps on getting better ! So if you see any strangers around , you shoot first , and leave all the questions to me . I 'll do that . Marguerite , you have to listen to me ! You have ten seconds to tell me why you killed my husband ! Now that 's more like the Marguerite I 'm used to . Eight seconds ! Marguerite , please ! I did not kill Martin ! My name is Maylene . All right ! All right ! You 're Maylene , this is Wyoming , and I 'm a bloody cowboy ! But that does not change the fact that I did not kill your husband . The sheriff says you did ! No , Sheriff Challenger says that Jeremiah Roxton killed him . Now I 'm John Roxton . He 's got me confused with someone else , the ... same way I confused you with someone else that I care about . Very deeply . Please . You have no reason to fear me . I have no reason to harm you . Sometimes , out here , being afraid is the only thing that keeps you alive . - It doesn 't have to be that way . - Yes it does . You have to trust me . I need your help . I don 't know who you are . John ... Jeremiah ... I think you should go . I don 't have anywhere to go ! Hell , I don 't know how we ... how I got here ... let alone how to get back where I belong . I can 't help you . Uf , If this isn 't a dream , or a hallucination . What the hell is it ? That 's right , Maylene . Where do you go in the world when you need help ? Well , that 's quite a story , May . You always said you wished your life had more adventure . I don 't think I 'm cut out for it , though . Not like you . Funny how things turn out . All I ever wanted was a good man like your Martin . And a little place to call my own . I lost my man . Nothing else matters after that . I know . So what do you think you should do about this lord Roxton ? - If doesn 't matter what ... - Of course , Veronica . Well , he couldn 't have gone very far . He didn 't . Is that him ? Not hard on the eyes at all . Hello , Veronica . You think everyone you meet is someone else ? Only the people who are someone else . Why did you follow me here ? I took a chance that whoever you would go to for help ... would be someone I could trust . And I believe I can trust you . Well , you were right about that too . He isn 't thinking straight at all . Whiskey ? Maybe when this whole problem is sorted out ... You really aren 't from around here , are you ? I have to find Challenger . If he 's looking for you , that shouldn 't be hard to do . I have to get to him first , and try and sort out this ... crazy situation . Why ? Because you think he 's someone else too ? - A scientist you said . - A brilliant one . And if I can get him to remember that , hopefully he can figure out ... where we are , and how we all got here and how we can get home . Because believe me , I certainly can 't . Look friend . If there 's one thing I 've learned in ... my life of adventure ... is that things look different in the morning . There 's a bunk out back and you 're welcome to use it . Violet , you can 't ! I can and I will . Maylene is the closest thing I 've got to a friend around here , and if you hurt her in any way , Sheriff Challenger will be the least of your worries . Point taken . Now where can I find him ? I 'm warning you , he 's as crooked as a snake , and he 's got a partner . What else do you know ? Nothing about Maylene 's husband . But a whole lot more about Sheriff Challenger and his partner than I care to know . Best advice I can give you is to keep your ears open . What do you think you 're doing ? Challenger said he 's looking for Roxton and whoever is helping him . If he finds that man here , you 're going to hang too . From what I 've heard , Challenger spends all of his time ... camped at the river , looking for rustlers , he says . May , come on ! Why don 't you get some sleep ? I sure could use some . Don 't worry , everything is going to be just fine . I just have to finish a few things here . - I 'll see you in the morning . - Okay . If someone 's paying attention . Things should be a whole lot better come sunrise . At least Veronica still knows how to make a map . That you , Angus ? Whoever you are , you 'd better come out now ! I believe the traditional saying is reach for the sky . Now you drop that ! You don 't know who you 're dealing with , son . Oh but I do . You are Professor George Challenger , late of the University of Edinburgh ... leader of an expedition to the lost plateau ... Keep talking . The plateau is home to a shifting series of realities . Yeah , we get a lot of them around here . It wouldn 't be the first time . You see , back in the real world , you and I are the best of friends . Close friends ? I said I 'd follow you through to hell and back ... and sometimes I think we 've come pretty close . If that 's the case , then that gun is just one big bluff . Listen to me George ! You 're the only one who can get us out of here ! I 'll get you out of here all right . Don 't make me do it , George ... Don 't make me do it ... Please ! You 're our only hope ! It 's Roxton ! Sorry , old boy . I was wondering when you show up , Neddy boy . The question is , whose side are you on . Malone ! Roxton ! I 've been looking all over for you . You recognize me ? Of course I recognize you . Why wouldn 't I recognize my old friend ? I mean after all ... You can save me a whole lot of trouble ... just by dying . Now you listen to me , Ned . You 're Ned Malone . You 're a journalist for the International Herald Tribune . Yeah ! And you , you 're Wyatt Earp . Come on friend , get up ! I hate to kill a man who 's not resisting . - I 'm not playing your games . - Who 's playing ? This is business . Get up ! And run ! If you insist . All right . Now we 're going to have some fun . Ah , the Widow Montgomery . Always a pleasure . What do you want ? I 'm looking for the man that killed your husband . The real question would be what 's got you so fired up . - I was on my way home ... - Well , it 's that way . By the hanging tree ... By the way , you wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ? I 've heard you 're pretty handy with that thing . Jeremiah Roxton did not kill my husband . Your man 's not even cold in the ground ... and you 've gone and found another . I am sorry , ma 'am . I just hate loose ends . Is that ring a bell ? my friend . - What are you doing here ? - Violet told me what she did , leaving you the gun and the map . I didn 't say anything I have to say you after that , so I just left . Violet did the right thing . Yeah , if you want to get yourself killed . You 're both going to swing . Who is he in your world ? A shiftless outlaw . Johnny Ringo . Who do you think he is ? Someone we should probably tie up before he causes any more trouble . I knew you weren 't the killer . Well , give me enough time and I 'll help you remember everything . At least you tell a good story . Sheriff , over there ! Well , howdy , Ringo . That 's quite a trail you left . You got something to tell me ? It was Roxton and Montgomery 's widow . That timid little mouse is riding with Roxton ? Get me out of this , and give me a gun . I 'm not sure I should . You see , something else has happened . Roxton came looking for me , and the embarrassing thing is ... he found me . - What ? - Not what ? How ? You see , apart from me and the boys , you 're the only one who knows where we 're camped . You 're crazy ! I didn 't tell Roxton where you were and you know it . Maybe you didn 't . But if you didn 't tell him , who did you tell ? Violet . Violet . Is this the first place you remember here ? Yeah . You and I found this tree in the middle of the jungle . Next ... This was old and weathered , but still in one piece , Hanged from the branch up there . There was a tombstone with my name on it , right over there . You read from it . Was Challenger with us ? You and Miss Krux , I mean , when you found this place . He was back at the tree house . - Tree house ? - Yes , where we all live . Challenger was there with Violet and Johnny Ringo . Who do you think they are ... in your world ? Well , Ned Malone is an American journalist ... and Veronica Layton is a ... resourceful young woman who grew up alone in the jungle . Is there something happening between them as well ? You mean like there is between us ? Don 't kiss me again . You know , sometimes Marguerite is afraid of me , just as you are . That makes me think that maybe , someone broke her heart , the same way you 're heart 's been broken ... and she 's still not ready to risk that happening again . Did someone ever break your heart ? Oh , I never met the woman who could break my heart . Until I met Marguerite . Sorry , that might hurt a little . It 's just a scratch . You 're making me sorry I ever killed the doctor I imagine he 's sorry too . There ! That 's it ? No thank you ? Or should I put that on your tab too ? I had something else in mind for you and me to do next . I 've made a lot of mistakes in my life , Johnny , but never the same one twice . You take a lot of things for granted , Violet . I know Roxton was here , telling his lies . I also know that you believed those lies . And I know that you ... told him where to find Challenger . I swear , Johnny . I didn 't say . There 's only one way out of this for you now , Violet . Roxton came here once looking for help . He might be fool enough to do it again . And if he does ... you 're going to pay your tab ... to me . Whoa ! Challenger ! Here . Widow Montgomery , the Sheriff . Drop your rifle and come outside . What are they doing ? Your last chance . Man up ! Burn it ! - Burning down my cabin . - No ! It 's not the cabin , he wants . Why are they doing this to me ? It 's me he 's after . He knows you are helping me . How ? The only person that knows is Violet , and she would never tell . There 's one other . Johnny Ringo . I 've got to get Challenger away from those deputies , now . I just hope Ringo 's packed enough ammunition . How would Challenger know what Johnny Ringo knows ? Unless the sheriff and Ringo are partners . Triple M ! I believe this belongs to you . I gave this to Martin the day we were married . He gave me this . Johnny Ringo must have killed him . Yeah , Ringo and the sheriff . And they are trying to hang anyone they can find to cover it up . No , Maylene , no ! You 're not a murderer ! There has to be another way . I want them , dead or alive . There 's goes the element of surprise , Come on ! Hold on Ride for the river ! It 's our only chance ! Never outrun them . Where are we going ? Elementary tactics ... we 're heading for the high ground . Let 's go ! Back at the rocks . Cut them down ! Damn . The high ground isn 't as useful when you 're almost out of ammunition . Roxton ! We can do this easy ... or we can do this ... Hard . You know the high ground better than I do . The river is over that cliff . Cliff ! Just when my ankle is getting better . Let 's go . Right boys , cut them down ! Can a prairie girl swim ? Can Miss Krux ? Like a mermaid . Then so can I. Hell ! whooooa ! We weren 't be able to follow them now . Oh , we don 't have to . there 's only one place they can go . This isn 't right . There 's no horses ! It 's never closed ! Violet ? Anyone here ? Whose there ? - Violet . - Maylene . May ? Run May ! It 's a trap ! Run ! Too late ! - You murdered my husband ! - It 's all right ! You 'll see him soon enough . You 're like a bad penny ! Now , you let her go , Ringo . That 's what Malone would do . Not in this lifetime . Shoot back ! I can 't . He 's still my friend . Ready to give up ? Why prolong the agony ? My thoughts exactly . Come on , Maylene , we 've got to get out of here . Oh , you 'll get out of here all right , but not in the way you planned . - Shoot him ! - No . Without Challenger we don 't go home . If we die here , then everything is over . Live to fight another day ! Go ! Roxton ! You take care of her . Violet ! I 've got my own account to settle . - Violet ! - Women . - Violet ! - No . No ! Keep dreaming , May , for the both of us . NO ! No , no , this isn 't happening ! I won 't accept this ! Not closer Challenger ! I 'm your old friend , Roxton . You wouldn 't shoot me . What have I done ? You got the man who killed my husband ... the man who tried to kill you ! You saw that justice was done . This belongs to you . John ! What is it ? Oh , I knew I didn 't like this place . Did you see that ? Marguerite , I lived it ! So at the end of this little day dream , you were the noble lawman , who tamed the wild west . It was much more than a daydream , Marguerite . Well , for Maylene , it must have been a dream come true . Roxton made sure that justice was done for her husband . And for Jeremiah Roxton . Yeah . Too bad about you and me . And Violet , even she paid the price for taking the outlaws ' money . Justice fifty years too late if you ask me . Justice is never too late , that 's why the tombstone and the noose disappeared . Because some cowboy was hung for a crime he didn 't commit ? Somehow his restless spirit ... magically caused that noose and tombstone to appear in the jungle . Where a good person might find it , and set things to rights . In this world or the next . Well I 'm proud of you . Well , thank you , Veronica . See that 's the way a great western supposed to end , the hero gets a kiss from the pretty girl . The hero is supposed to kiss his horse . Since when did you become so cynical ? You were there . You saw the noose , and the tombstone disappear . Me cynical ! You should have met my third husband . Or was it the fourth ? Are you jealous ? Of this drab and dreary prairie girl ? She was ... the most beautiful woman I ever met . You said she looked exactly like me . Care to ride off into the sunset ? *

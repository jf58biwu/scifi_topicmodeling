 " And so the sexual odyssey of these two strangers breaks every taboo leading to an unforgettable 9 1 / 2 Weeks . " Read me another video box , Mommy . No , honey , it 's time to board the sleepy train to slumber land where fairies make all your sweet dreams come true . Lockdown ! Oh , Mom , I 'm fully medicated . Milo , last night you were up till dawn trying to circumcise ants . That 's not crazy . It 's a matter of hygiene . Milo doesn 't seem as hyper tonight . I didn 't even have to use the chloroform teddy bear . Maybe the little hobbledehoy is finally starting to calm down . Hey , Dad . Dagnab it , I 'm still riddled with tartar . - Mai tai , Pop ? - What 's the occasion ? Milo got suspended for doing something unspeakable with a fish stick . And this is his punishment ? I started to spank him , and somehow , it turned out like this . Well , the best laid plans . Anywho , I 've got something here that just might help . I don 't want him smoking that stuff . Honey , it 's a bonsai tree . The trimming and tending of these little fellas is supposed to induce a calm , meditative state . Give her a try , son . Bob Oblong , you 're a genius . Oh , not a genius , dear . I 'm just a little man trying to do big things . Oh , criminy . He 's more manic than ever , doc . You 've gotta do something . Let 's take your temperature , kid . Say , ah . - So you 've been feeling a little stressed ? - No more than usual . I 've previously diagnosed your son with the typical valley childhood ailments : ADD , OCD , TTD and , of course , foamy diarrhea . He does eat a lot of soap . Well , I 'm not a psychiatrist , but I do have a pen and prescription pad . And there 's no problem I 'm not willing to throw a pill at . He 's already on everything from Ritalin to Rogaine . We were hoping for something different . - How about dolphin therapy ? - l 'm intrigued , doctor . Tell me more . Well , dolphins are instinctively attuned to the frailties of humans and blah , blah , blah . Of course. lt seems so obvious . Yes , he 's healing nicely . Maybe I should 've fed him first . Do you wanna go in again , sweetie ? No , thank you . The fact is , almost any kind of animal can be therapeutic . Here. I pulled this out of a patient . Boxy and I will be best friends forever . Remember , hon , nothing lives forever . But when he croaks , I can use him as an ashtray . - My little Martha Stewart . - Bob ! It 's a little Scottie . Oh , my God. ls he okay ? Can I keep him ? He 'll be my best friend forever . What about Boxy ? He ran away . It says here , " When a dog is sick , you should give him lots of space and peace and quiet . " I know what dogs like . Well , I 've done all I can do . Come on , Scottie . You gotta pull through . You 're my best friend . I know how you feel , Milo . Before I found my pet clam , I was lackluster and morose . That 's a coin purse . Oh , life just deals me one blow after another . Hey , look . He ate all his food ! Maybe he 's feeling better . Yeah ! Give him more ! He likes the kind that makes its own gravy . - Oh , Helga . - What ? I had gravy for breakfast . Hey , hey ! Look what I found . A turtle named Boxy . Wow , a dog . Milo , bedtime . If he goes for the window , get him with the net . I 'll be behind you with the stun darts . Bob , if I don 't make it I want you buried alive with me . Yes , dear . Well , wrap me in bacon and call me rumaki . Scottie 's sleeping . Wow , that dog has really had an effect on you . When something you love depends on you , you just wanna take care of it and make sure it 's safe . - Know what I mean ? - Not really , no . But the important thing is you 're happy . Don 't worry , boy . You 'll be okay . Dear God or godlike figure , please make my doggie all better . I mean , look around here . You owe me . When I wake up , Scottie better be all healed or the devil 's got a new errand boy . Praise the lord . Amen . - Where 's Scottie ? What are you doing ? - Burying beer . Crud , that means I drank gopher poison . Scottie , you 're okay . Doctor , that dog has made him more hyper than ever . Well , I could remove his testicles . That often calms them down . We were kind of hoping for grandchildren . You 're a real idiot , aren 't you ? All right , that 's darn close to crossing the line . Look , there 's only one real solution to your problem . You 've got to give the dog away . Give Scottie away ? No ! But I love Scottie . I don 't wanna give him away . I know , baby . Sometimes life really blows . Can we at least send him someplace he 'd be happy ? Like , to Alaska , where he could be a sled dog ? - He loves to run . - Alaska ? Hey , my roommate in college was an Eskimo . Operator , give me Klondike 5-01 01 . Eskimo Joe . You old whale-stabber . Damn it , I 've been telling you for 20 years , I 'm not an Eskimo. lt was a costume party . Now , don 't call here again . I don 't know what 's got into Eskimo Joe . Maybe Cowboy Mike needs a dog . We 'll find a good home for Scottie . I 'm glad you 're being mature about this . What a handsome animal . Poor dog acts like he 's never seen a woman before . Here comes the girl with the beak . - Can I have him ? - No . It 's my boss , Mr. Klimer . So , Oblong , where 's this purebred Scottish terrier we read about ? Hello , sir . Right this way , sir . Watch your step , sir . Why don 't you check for polyps while you 're up there ? Excellent zinger , son . Pretty , little fluffy-wuffy nuffy-puppy . Good lines . Acceptable stench . Nipple-free undercarriage . - We 'll take it . - No way . Son , the Klimers can afford to give Scottie the things we can 't . Big yard , toys , that operation so he can 't bark anymore . - Can I live with you too , mister ? - No . is it because of this ? Why , yes . Yes , it is . Milo , if you really love Scottie , I think this is what 's best for him . Come on , Milo . Cheer up . Hey , Milo , look . I can turn my butt into clacker balls . It 's funny and sad . Gosh , I wonder who that can be . It 's a dog ! It 's Homeless Bill . It 's your new doggie . I 'm whatever you want , kid , as long as you keep the horse meat coming . He smells like pee-pee . I 'm keeping him . Fetch , boy . - What are you doing ? I 'm a human . - That 's what they all say . That was weird . I can 't go on. I have to see Scottie . Here 's a door . I 'll just stay here and guard the door . Scottie ! Wow , he 's got everything . I just have a towel on the floor and an old batting helmet to eat out of . This is what I dream my marital bed will be like . Except , it will contain a swarthy Lothario with a master 's in speech therapy . Hey , push that box of cow hooves closer . Oh , God , yes . Someone 's coming . Goodbye , my Scottie . I 'm glad you have a happy life . He 's such a cutie-ootie . What 's he doing ? Oh , my God . He 's making . Daddy , do something . I was afraid of something like this , and if it happened once it 's going to happen again . - l 've gotta go to the bathroom . - Bob , you know the rules . You gotta wait for the woman with the urine caddy to come around . She always stares at me , and then I can 't go . The heck with it . I 'm gonna piddle like a man . Godspeed , Bob Oblong . Oblong , what the hell are you doing away from the line ? Well , sir , this is kind of embarrassing , but I had to make water . Washed your hands , I hope . Actually- - So , what 's going on in there ? Important cosmetic research . Top secret . - You 're not Chinese , are you ? - No , sir . Well , if you want , I 'll give you a tour , for two weeks ' salary . - Sorry , what was that ? - Too late . Tour 's started . The beaver is ready . Why are they putting a sombrero on a beaver ? I think you have your answer . Bring out the fez and a fresh beaver . Scottie . What 's he doing here ? My children tired of it , so we 're using it to test a new cologne . It drives the ladies wild . It 's making him fall asleep . Yes , it has a side effect of narcolepsy . But on the upside , it no longer causes night blindness or anal leakage . But , sir , I promised my son this dog would be well cared for . I said , his anus is no longer leaking . What do you want , man ? Can I have him back , sir ? My boy really loves him . Absolutely not . The science must continue . Now , back to the assembly line . Oblong ? Will you at least think about the dog ? I have to keep this terrible news about Scottie to myself . No sense burdening the family . Scottie 's being used as a test animal at Globocide . - Oh , my God ! - What 's wrong with me ? - l have to keep my mouth shut . - Hey , Dad . Scottie 's being used as a test animal at Globocide . That sucks . I did it again . We 've got to keep this quiet . Where 's Beth ? I wonder what Scottie 's doing right now . Maybe he 's having dinner too or bouncing on his trampoline . is this just the regular dinner crying , or is this something different ? - Son , I have some bad news about Scottie . - Oh , my God . They took his trampoline away . This may be harder than we thought . I 'm sorry about what happened to Scottie , son . - l don 't blame you if you hate me . - l don 't hate you , Dad . I hate the company you work for . We gotta break him out of that hellhole . Son , we have to work within the system to get Scottie out . I 'm going to go upstairs and begin self-publishing a satirical cartoon strip lampooning this injustice . We 'll start out in the local Pennysaver , build up to the suburban weeklies- - - We 're breaking Scottie out , Bob . - Yes , dear . Now ! God . Go . Okay , this is what you trained for , sweetie . Remember , doll-baby , if you trip a laser we all meet at the Yellow Rose in Ensenada . Team one . Team two . Team three . Trespasser , die . Knock them down so we can check out their asses . - Freeze ! - lt 's okay , boys . We 're the ... . - The entertainment . - What entertainment ? It 's me , you idiot . Look at all these animals . We have to free them , Dad . Run ! Go ! Scottie , wake up . What 's wrong with him ? He 's sleeping . As soon , you will all be . Stupid dog . Back . Back . Go , Scottie ! No ! Scottie . Scottie , wake up . Look , he must be having a simple , little dog dream . I missed you too , boy . Not on the lips , son. lt 's not right . Come on . - What 's wrong with him ? - He 's a narcoleptic . An undercover drug agent ? Sure . Fine . Run . What are we gonna do with Scottie now ? He 'll just make Milo crazy again . Maybe not . Look . I 've never seen Milo so calm before . It 's right out of Norman Rockwell . " A Boy and His Narcoleptic Dog . " I wonder what Scottie 's dreaming of . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

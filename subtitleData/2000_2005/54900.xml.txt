But in the future , not that there 'II be a future , if I need your help , I 'II ask . Don 't worry about it , I 'm getting out of here . I saved your life twice . Least you can do is Ioan me enough money so I can go home . I would , but they 'II be looking for you at every bus station and shuttle launch . Me ? They don 't even know what I Iook like . Every club in this city has a biometric camera system . They took hundreds of pictures of you . They know what you look like . only way you 're going home now is in a box . That 's just great . Now what ? After you . Hey , Roy . pluto ! What are you doing here ? My place is getting redecorated and I need a place overnight . Sure ! 3D . The code is 4-5-7 . Thanks , Roy .

You know the only thing I liked about it ? - You could see the Moon at night ? - Bingo . - Is something wrong with your toaster ? - He 's all right . He 's just recharging . Can he hear us ? Not while he 's charging . ShouIdn 't your bodyguard be able to keep up with you on the way to a gunfight ? You might want to think about trading him in . I can 't trade in Bruno . We got a history together . I got 20 years of riII-hopping experience wired into him . - RiII-hopping ? - well , that 's a ... . smuggling . That 's what I went to jail for . He ain 't the fastest thing in the world , but he got me out of lots of tight squeezes . A little smokier than usual . - He 's a fire hazard . - He 's all right . Where are you going ? I got to go talk to an old friend , see what I can find out . What am I supposed to do ? Make sure Bruno don 't burn the place down . - You 're leaving me alone with him ? - I Ieft . pluto !

She should have married me . You should have went to the gym and lost weight . I 'd have lost the weight if she married me . Otherwise , what 's the point ? I really need your help . I got to get to Rex Crater . Forget it . Nobody gets to him . - Who the hell is this guy ? - A myth , an enigma . He lives in a penthouse above the Lunar Grand hotel . Never comes out . You was a cop for 20 years . You got to have some kind of idea who he is . Some people think he 's a clone . There was a clone doctor named Runa Pedanken . Made a big name for herself creating a basketball team from one old guy . The Air Jordans . Right after cloning was outlawed back Earth , Pedanken came up here . She was the best in her field until she got herself murdered . That was about eight years ago . I 'm going to need to hack into police files . You mean , you need me to hack into police files . I thought you 'd never ask . Pedanken , Runa . Initiate global search . file deleted . Sorry , that 's all there is . She wasn 't doing this by herself . Who worked with her ? She had an assistant . We questioned her for days about the murder . Got nothing . That 's because you have no finesse . Who is she and where do I find her ? Mona Zimmer . Runs a body alteration shop on Microsoft and Sixth . That 's what I Iove about you . I ask you a simple question , four hours later , I get a simple answer . Boss ? Where did the boss go ? I don 't know . Out . He said to wait for him here . Out ? He never goes anywhere without me . And I heard that toaster crack . Bruno , give me that old badge you got . - Who are we going to arrest ? - I need your help . Sure . Where are we going ? It 's just got to be the two of us . You go next time . Promise . That 's gratitude for you . We were hoping that for our anniversary we could get a brand-new us . How romantic . You 're in luck ! I just happen to have a cancellation . Fantastic ! Are you all original or have you been previously improved ? AII original . really ? Yes , from top to bottom . Okay , then . well , what exactly did you have in mind ? We were thinking we could start with some ass-rescuIpting for her to get a little more bubbIage- - I happen to have a great ass ! I 'm not saying your ass isn 't great . We 'd Iike something- - could you do something about his big mouth ? Do you have any catalogues ? Maybe we could get some ideas . Come this way , I 'II show you exactly what you want . Thank you . Come on , honey . Look at the asses on the wall . Yeah . Don 't push it . Let 's start with some of the basic body types . Here 's one I think you 'II really like . The Amazon . I don 't like that . That makes me look like a big dufus , doesn 't it ? - Where would we buy clothes ? - I don 't want to be the big dufus . Good point . Let me try again . This one I 'm particularly proud of . The Venice Beach . Wait a minute . I think you done found something there . Look at that , honey . Yeah , look at that . Look at me ! This is me ? It could be . Honey , I 'm looking and I 'm thinking that you need to rethink the ass enhancement . It will work , it will help out . What you want is to have a ... . You know ? She also needs a little more of this , too , up top . Can you fix this ? If you could spruce these up a little . Just a little sprucier . I know that she has ample now . But I 'm talking titties galore . Let 's have the titties really flowing . Yeah , Iike that . Look at that . Why don 't we step into my office and discuss the terms ? Yes , Iet 's go in and sign up ! Look at that ! Before we get started , there 's a few things I 'd Iike to talk over with you . First of all , will you be paying in cash or would you Iike to take advantage of our flexible financing plan ? AII in cash , all at once . - excellent ! medical records ? - Right here . And police permit ? Our police permits ? I think you 'II find that our police permits are in order . police permits . Sorry , no can do . Not without a police permit . It 's Body alteration 101 . You could be fugitives , killers , anybody . No , we 're just a couple trying to put the spark back in our relationship . The idea of revealing such personal details to the police . please , Dr. Zimmer ? AII right . Come back tonight , 8 : 00 sharp . But it 's another $ 10,000 upon completion . AII right . Then , doctor , you are busted . Give me a break . What are you guys , the health Department ? You wish we were . Listen , you got one chance . You answer some questions for me . And I want the truth . Okay , what do you want to know ? - When you worked for Runa Pedanken- - - I never heard of her . You want to play games ? Put the cuffs on her . Come on , cuff her . No ! Just hold on ! hold the cuffs . tell me everything you know and don 't play games with me , Mona . talk to me . What do you know ? Right now . AII right , all right . Towards the end , Runa was dealing with some pretty heavy characters but she didn 't tell me who . And she didn 't keep any records . But one day I walked into her office as she was showing one of the guys out and he left his briefcase behind . The initials WZW were embossed on it in gold . And it was made out of genuine alligator skin . Are you with me ? Earth goods . That 's all I know . I swear it . Just for the record , I have never had one complaint about my ass . I was just playing . I said that for the lady . It was part of the scam . Ma , what are you doing here ? Seeing that you 're all right . Ma , this is Dina . Dina , my mother . You 're his mother ? Why , you got a problem with that ? I 'm surprised . You could easily pass for his sister . Thank you . Why are you gaIIivanting around ? You 'II wind up dead . I got to take care of those guys that blew up my club . - You got to get your ass off the Moon ! - I don 't think so . You think you 're a hot-shit , ex-riII-hopping , burned-down-cIub-owning guy but once in a while , listen to your mother . AII right , I 'II get off the Moon ! But can I get something to eat first ? God ! Bruno , get some beer and sandwiches . And you ought to be a little nicer to your robot . Be nicer to my robot ? You been in here bitching to my moms ? gentlemen . Suite with a hot tub ?

That 's it . - Code generator serial number ? - 8-7-4-3-5-0-8 . Check . It 's not my business , but why don 't we just rent a car instead of stealing one ? Because you can 't rent these . - What 's so special about it ? - It 's a chrysler DeSoto S-5000 . It cruises on a 14-inch cushion of air , hikes up to 64 inches in rough terrain . It 's heat and meteor resistant , with a torque compressor power thrust and a kick-ass sound system . Trust me on this one . Bruno , I need an ignition chip . This might do the trick . It will work perfect . Got to love a place where your bodyguard and car have interchangeable parts . Smart-ass . After you . Good evening , Mr. Vandervoort . James here . Aren 't you early , sir ?

Here you are . I finally get to meet the great Rex Crater ? Or is it Mike Marucci ? Yeah , Mike Marucci . Thought you were so damn smart , I figured you out . I should come over there and put my foot in your fat grease-baII ass . So you got it all figured out , huh ? It is a pleasure to meet me . I 'm pretty feisty , huh ? What 's this , a rented tuxedo ? You know , you 're old enough to own your own tuxedo . Sit down ! You know , you should be honored . only person besides yourself to ever come up here is BeIcher over there . What 's going on here ? Remember when they cut your appendix out eight years ago in prison ? gambling had just been outlawed on Earth , so my old boss Mike Marucci , commissioned Dr. Runa Pedanken to create a clone of someone who knew their way around the Moon . For what ? He was starting a gambling operation and needed someone to front for him . Someone intelligent , that he could control . A puppet . That didn 't jive with my career plan so I sent Marucci and Pedanken into orbit . Then , for sentimental reasons , or because I 'm a nice guy , I let you live . until you got in my way . Let 's face it , why should I keep you around ? For what ? I got your good looks , your charm and your wit . I even got your memories . - You got my memories ? - Yeah . Never wondered how my people knew to look for you in your hideout ? Or the Paradise motel , which , by the way , is a disgusting establishment .

Mr. Mogan , I want to personally thank you for the outstanding job you 've done . Thank you , sir . It was a pleasure and an honor . You see , when you have the experience me and my men have , it 's quite easy- - Oh , shit . Incompetent jackasses . Get them out of here . I 'd love to let you hang around so you can entertain me but we might have a conflict of interest . But there 's something I want you to see before I say bye-bye to you . Look at that . An excellent piece of real estate , but you never took advantage of its potential . This- - This is wrong . That should say Rex 's , because this is Rex 's . little America 's most exclusive new casino ! tell me , what do you think ? little America is not a gambling town and pluto 's isn 't a casino . I think you 're a clown and you should take all this stupid casino shit out . If you get your dumb-ass name off the front maybe you 'II be in business for more than a week . - Sorry , it 's not wood , is it ? - Yes , and it 's hand-carved ! Sorry ! I 'm sorry ! Pick that shit up ! Shit . hold it , right there , robot . Which one 's pluto ? Which one 's Rex ? BeIcher ! - Shoot him , BeIcher ! - Shoot him , BeIcher ! Damn it ! What are you waiting for ?

 I finally figured out wormholes . I can get you home . If I knew where home was or where we are . You might not wanna come with us . We are not the best traveling companions . Aeryn we haven 't heard from . Has she contacted you ? No , not yet . What do you want from me ? What I want may not be as bad as you think . What are you doing ? My interrogations are much more agreeable than Scorpius 's methods . He 'll never bother you again . Bury him . Elack , if we don 't find the strength , it 's all been for nothing . I will find them again and when I do , they will pay for this humiliation . I 've said goodbye to everyone . I can 't make any of you stay . You have more courage , integrity and honesty than a dozen Vellas . And I should have said that to her . - So , any response from Moya ? - Not yet . We are hunted by Peacekeepers , lost in the Uncharted Territories with no purpose in life . One of us has a purpose . Don 't you , Crichton ? You 're right . I do have a purpose . And now , on Farscape . No sign of Moya yet ? Nothing . No response on the comms . So , why don 't we land ? I am starving . Isn 't that a planet out there ? Hot and lifeless . Do you eat rock ? Hmm . Right now , I think I could . You ate only three solar days ago . How inefficient is your body ? How edible is yours ? I can see there 's not much meat on there , but I 'm sure there 's a lot of chew on your noggin . Oh , damn . How do you roll a window down in this place ? I should have stayed on the module . Should have left him on the module . Oh , I need food ! We all need food , Buckwheat . You don 't hear the rest of us fumigating the joint . Here . What 's that ? Jilnak . Very good for you . Huh ? - Give it to Mikey there . He 'll eat anything . Oh ... More ? - Hey , what do you know ? - Mikey likes it . One portion apiece . Uh , three stomachs , three portions , no ? It 's not bad . Mmm . It 's actually quite good . That stuff 's not gonna turn anybody into a newt , is it ? Eat it . It 's jilnak . Restorative . Uh , if you don 't want it , I , uh ... Rygel . Hmm ? How come everything tastes like chicken ? What 's chicken ? I 'll be back . Don 't you leave without me . Oh ... Hmm ... Restorative ? You call that a restorative ? Try " purgative . " Here . This 'll help the cramp . You better get away from me before I spew on you . I am inside out . But you 're not hungry anymore . Okay , where 's Rygel ? Down that hole , taking a giant slok . Rygel ? Buckwheat ? Rygel ? Hey , Sparky ! You down there ? Rygel ? ! Guido ? ! Man , I got one of those chunks stuck up in my nose . I hate that . Rygel , what the frell are you doing ? Buckwheat , I thought you came down here to drop some friends off at the pool . I did ... I will . Well , do your business and let 's get out of here . And that stuff belongs to somebody else . We have enough enemies already . I thought you said the planet 's lifeless . On the surface , yes . But down here ... What 's this ? Medicines . Oh , great . Another klepto . No , no , no , no , no . These markings are familiar . I 've seen them before somewhere , but where ? - Who cares ? - Let 's get out of here . Exactly . Help ! Watch it . Trip lights everywhere . D. I know , I see them . No ! Uh-uh , uh-uh . Booby traps . I can 't move . Help me . Get me out . D 'Argo ! Crichton ! Will someone frelling answer me ? Stand clear . It 's no good . Somebody help me . I 'm stuck . We 're all stuck . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Oh , I really need to slok . My bowels hate me . I hate you . Get me out ! Do something ! I 'm open to suggestions . Where have I seen these markings before ? On Cavari ? Yes . No , no , not Cavari . It must have been Eldor Two . D , we may have to stick Granny in a home . I think we should burn her . You burn your old folks ? No , just sounded like a good idea . Wait , you hear that ? Sparky , shut up . Stop your whingeing , will ya ? Don 't forget to kill the traps . No , course not . Traps are off . I don 't know why they make us set the traps the first place ! Rygel . - Plague . Children sick , dying . Then soldiers brought provisions . Come on , Frool ! Get ... Tarkans ! These belong to the Tarkans . - Yo , Grandma ! Come on ! Go ! I tell you . I tell you the Tarkans ... Play dead . Crichton , don 't ... don 't leave me . I remember now ... - Shh . Shh . Zip it . Come on , we still got a lot of crates to move . How come I always gotta do all the heavy lugging ? Because you 're not smart enough to do anything else , that 's why . Oh ? Well , why are you here ? Because I 'm not smart enough to hang out with anyone else . Okay , do you think we can take ' em out ? I don 't know . What if they got friends downstairs ? I 'll take these two , you can take the friends . What if there 's a hundred of ' em ? Of these guys ? We should be so lucky . Shh , look at this . No violence . These are Tarkans ... Somethin ' set off the traps . Yeah . It got itself stuck . Will you come on ? Is it dead ? - Aah ! Smells dead . - But it 's not , yet . Gentlemen ... I apologize for disturbing your work . If you 'd be so kind to get me free , I 'll be on my way . It speaks . It steals , too . Any more of you ? No , I 'm all alone . Yeah , I can see why . - Come on . We 've captured an intruder . It claims it 's all alone . Is it armed ? No . But it 's sure making some strange noises . Don 't touch it . Wait for me . I 'm on my way . You , come with me . What are you doing ? Did I not tell you to stay put ? Listen to me . These are Tarkans . They 're good people . You know jack about these people . Now , you stay behind cover . Greetings , Tarkans . We are honored to meet you . We mean you no harm . You said you were alone . I 've never seen her before . No , not alone . There 's a human and a Luxan , too . Oh , I 've told them of your good works , but they 're shy . Come on out . It 's all right . Crichton , D 'Argo , show yourselves . - Burning is too good for her . Come on , Crichton , D 'Argo . Granny . What are you doing ? You have got to stop wandering off like this . Thanks for looking after her , fellas . She 's a little . You haven 't seen my dog , have ya ? Little Bubba ? You got caught in a trap ? Crichton , get me out . I got an idea . Why don 't we all put our guns down . There 's two more ! Stop ! No violence . No firing ! What 's going on down there ? It 's no good . They 're shielded . They got body armor ? That 's a hell of an invention . How come we don 't have that ? You three ! Get them ! Where are you going ? Don 't leave me . I 'll keep you company . Perhaps I should introduce myself . I am ... Oh , please , don 't hurt me ! Ah , thank you . This won 't go unrewarded . You ... you didn 't finish . Wha-What are you doing ? - I 'll catch up . Crichton ? Those lights . I think they were pulse blasts . We gotta help ' em . We have to get to them first . Well , you 're a genius . How ? The cannon on the Luxan 's ship should ... Are you tenked ? Only D 'Argo can operate that ship . Maybe there 's another way in . That was some drop . Down here ! Ho ! We got another one . I found ' em ! Think we lost those two ? There 's no need for ... Oh ! Will you listen to me ? These are Tarkan freedom fighters . They 're heroes . On the planet Cavari , there was a deadly plague . The Tarkans defied the quarantine . They brought food , clean water , medicines . They saved thousands of lives . Whatever , they 're angels of mercy . Well , what do you expect ? You walk into their house , you steal , you shoot at them . In case you hadn 't noticed they started to shoot at us first . Right . - And they 'll keep shooting at us until we die , unless we talk to them . So let me mediate . You know , maybe we should let her try . Nah , she 's gonna get shot . And that would be bad ? Can we discuss this ? So , this is our intruder ? One of them . One ? You mean there 's more ? Three more . How did you find this place ? Who told you we were here ? Nobody . We found it by accident . And that Mooka chain just fell into your hand by accident , too ? I was just putting it back . Oh , please ! No , lava ! Oh ... I have the intruders cornered , but I ... I could do with some help . Why ? Shoot ' em ! Well , there 's two of them and they have two guns . I mean , will this ... this belt stop two guns at once ? - I 'm coming up . - No ! I 'll take care of it . You keep moving those crates ! Try to remember we 're on a schedule . Describe where you are . Look , how am I supposed to describe it ? It all just looks like rock to me . I won 't get shot . I trust Tarkans . Everyone knows their reputation . - I don 't . Me , either . Listen , John . We can 't shoot them . We 're trapped . Maybe we should let the old lady try and mediate a way out . All right . Fine . You 're up . Oh ... Are you all right ? What 's the matter ? - Yeah ? Oh , I 'm just a bit tired , that 's all . Grandma . You okay ? I think she 's asleep . Grandma . - Oi ! This is unbelievable . What , can 't cook , won 't bathe , and now she 's narcoleptic ? She 's a triple threat . Grandma , get up ! Any markings on the walls ? No . Wait . Yeah . There 's a ... some purple writing , but I don 't know what it says . Purple ? Grandma ! The intruders are trapped in the small lower alcove . Yeah . Good . I know exactly where you are . Grandma , get up ! Do you see those purple markings ? Mm-hmm . - Shoot them . - Shoot the markings ? Yes . Shoot them . Now . Bad news . - Trouble . Somebody 's doing the Pompeii thing . Let 's go . Uh , more bad news . Same dren , different planet . Yeah , we 're trapped . Again . The lava 's rising . Jump . Jump ? Jump . Yeah , yeah , I can make that . But the , uh , old bat can 't . Old bats can fly . You 're up . All right , look , I lied . I can 't make that jump . You can 't make that jump ? Give me your foot . Come on . Go ! Hmm ... Okay . D , grab my hand . I can 't reach ! I didn 't know you could do that . It takes a bit of practice . I take it you did not find another entrance . No . What are you doing ? Trying to power up this vessel 's cannon . I take it your memory 's frelled . I told you only D 'Argo can operate this ship . And D 'Argo is a fool if he has not set an override sequence . I don 't think you should be blaming D 'Argo in this instance . He 's already saved your eema once . All right . Fine . He is a big and brave warrior . However , if these controls are locked to his DNA , it was not particularly smart of him not to have set up an override sequence . Wait ... Wait . You 're right . Yes , Chiana , I usually am . Then we don 't need D 'Argo to run this ship . We just need his DNA . And how do you suggest we get ... The intruders can 't be alive . Well , they are . Your miserable lava traps only got one of my men . Your men are worthless . Do you want to move all of these yourself ? You 're the one who 's so worried about the schedule . Of course not ... - Crichton , D 'Argo , can you hear me ? Rygel , are you all right ? No , I 'm dying . Please get me out of here before my bowels rupture . - Yeah , we 'll do that , Sparky . - Where are ya ? I don 't know . Lower level , some cavern . Big pool of lava ... All right , we 'll come get ya . Who 's this ? ! Lou Costello . Who 's this ? My name is Raa 'Keel . And my name is Uta-Noranti-Pralatong . I 'm afraid there 's been a huge misunderstanding which we really must rectify . A misunderstanding ? Yeah . We really shouldn 't be shooting each other . We didn 't come here to rob you guys . Hell , we didn 't know there was anybody on this rock . No , we 're not your enemies . We know who you are . You do ? Yes . Every educated species knows and reveres Tarkan Freedom Fighters . Then you approve of our work ? - Yeah ... - Absolutely . That thing you guys did on Calamari that was beautiful , man . Calamari ? - That was Nobel Peace Prize material . Yet you attempted to rob us ! Only because I did not realize whose stuff it was . Had I but known ... Yeah , please accept our apology on that . Listen , why don 't you give us the slug . We 'll punish him appropriately and we are outta your hair . All right . We 'll release him . Quickly . But he doesn 't look well . You 'd better come and get him . Yeah , we 'd love to do that . Where are you ? Stay where you are . I 'll send an escort . Fine . Find him . You know , I definitely do not trust this guy . Me neither , but I got an idea . Well , there 's no reason not to trust him , I mean why ... Grandma , zip it . We don 't wanna hear what saints the Tarkans are . We 're not going in there undefended . So you can either get with the program or you can shut up . - Preferably both . - What 's your idea ? All right , here 's the thing . I think that we ambush the escort , we hit him with a rock , and we take his belt . That is your plan ? - Yeah . To hit him with a rock , when they have these , like , shield things ? ! The shields work against pulse energy . They don 't work against other things . We saw the guy get burned . Yeah , but not by a rock . All right , let me lay this out for you . Fire is thermal energy . Thermal energy is like kinetic energy . A rock has kinetic energy . Ergo , a rock will work . Uh , okay , okay , I 'm with you . I just have , uh , one small , little question . Who is Lou Costello ? Wait ! What ? I want to help . Abbot and Costello . We 've been over this . Right . That was yours , so this must D 'Argo 's . No , no , no . This is Crichton 's . This is D 'Argo 's . No living creature could produce that . You haven 't met many Luxan 's have you ? Oh ! Okay . I should be doing this . Excuse me . I 'm the one that put my hands in the vomit . And I 'm the one who happened to observe D 'Argo 's starting procedure when we left Arnessk . Press this , this , that and those two together . This , this , and that . Power systems at your command , Ka D 'Argo . How do you fire up the cannon ? That I do not know . I 've never seen him use the cannon . Great . Random flailing is pointless , Chiana . Move aside and help me ... - Hey ! I 'm the one that put my hands in the vomit . Okay , you want a turn ? Go get your own vomit . Yes , the powder is ready . Come through , but don 't inhale . Okay . - What is it ? Sleeping powder ? I don 't know . She 's pretty vague . But this will knock ' em out . This wasn 't part of the plan . I signed on to haul crates , not get killed . Me , too . If I get killed , all my wives will throw fits . Ah ! Here , come on , come on , come on , Frool . Hey , fellas ! Huh ? Ooh , Frool , let 's do it . Ooh , yeah , baby . Take it off . I am the flower , you are the bee . I am the pod , you are the pea . I am the target , you are the gun . I am the woman , you are the man . Oh , my God ! Well , you 're not any help . Now , move aside . All right . Oh , careful . - Sorry . You better hurry . You 're losing your vomit . I think I 've decoded the right sequence . Slowly ... Actually , it 's really quite simple . To a great mind like yours . Okay . Fire the cannon . Certainly . I see the pattern . This locates the target . - Right . This one primes the charge . And this one ... fires . Really quite simple . Frell ! All right , so there 's nothing to turn on ? Somebody shoots me and I 'm protected ? Yeah . Well , I think we 'd better test it . Do you have any , uh , small appendages you don 't need ? Small ? Shoot him in the buttock . That 's big . Hey , you know what ? Don 't touch my ass . That 's sexual harassment . Whoa ! No , we are not shooting the butt . Okay . - The butt is off-limits . Try the heel , or ... why don 't we shoot you ? You got a small appendage . Shoot me ? Whoa ! Son of a gun , it works . Now can we go and talk to the Tarkans . There was no " we , " white girl . We appreciate what you did . It was different . But we have two belts , three people . You 're staying here . We 're not taking chances . Is this thing cutting out on me ? Energy-save mode . It 'll reactivate when it 's needed . Okay , let 's get outta here . You guys , show the way . Come on . Put some clothes on . You don 't understand . If I don 't take a slok soon , my insides will explode and I 'll die . Surprise , surprise , surprise . What happened ? They , uh , have our belts . Yeah , th-that 's right . I can see that . Sparky , you okay ? What do you think ? Just hang in there . Okay , here 's the deal , Tin Man . You can 't hurt us , we can 't hurt you . You 've got our whoopee cushion , we 've got Larry and Moe here . What do you say to a simple trade ? Why would I want these morons back ? Will you stop killing my men ! Shut up and stand still . John ! I got it . One of those frelling booby traps . You know that thing I said ? About the Nobel Peace Prize for Tarkans ? I take it all back . You think we 're Tarkan Freedom Fighters . We 're not . We 're robbing them . And you can identify us . Need I continue ? Right , so you 're robbers , whatever . We 're not cops . We don 't care . Actually , we 've performed quite a few burglaries ourselves . Well , you picked the wrong place to burglarize today . Who else is with you ? Uh ... Get frelled . Ah ! There 's an old woman , but she 's no threat . What would you know ? She can 't get out and no one else can get in . Why prolong her agony ? Save us some time and tell us where she is . Out riding her broomstick . I wonder which is worse . To burn to death from lava , or to suffocate in a column of armarack . What do you think ? Try something . I have tried every plausible combination . Well , then try something else . Like what ? Anything . All right . It 's the Tarkans . They 've come back early . Don 't be stupid . Why would they attack their own race ? Maybe they found our transport . If they blew it up , we 're trapped . It 's well hidden . How could they find it ? That was Lo 'La 's cannon . Someone is in my ship . It 's gotta be the girls , but how did they get your bodily fluids ? Don 't go there . You wondered who was with us . You just found out . That was our squad blasting their way in . Your squad ? Yeah . A whole platoon of big , hairy guys with really cool tats and more guns than you can count . They come down here and find us dead , they 're gonna slit you from crotch to eyeball with a dull deer antler . In other words , we die , you die . We live , and you might have a chance . You 're lying . Wait . If it 's true , we 're going to need some hostages . Why now ? Of all times you could have come here , why now ? Do you know how long I 've been planning this ? Life sucks , doesn 't it ? Well , quite often , in fact . Here , take this . If they try anything , throw it at them . No , no , no , don 't touch me . It was not my fault . Do not get angry . - No , don 't touch . No , no , not angry . Vomit . Vomit . Oh . Yes , we must conserve it . Okay , you stay at the controls . I 'm gonna go down and check things out . It might be an idea to try and turn the ship invisible . If ... if you can figure out how . You said this 'd be easy . While the Tarkans are off delivering food to the orphans , we loot the place , then disappear . Gun battles weren 't part of the deal . Stop complaining . You 're wearing a shield belt . We were six ! We 're now three . Then try and shoot straight , you incompetent . It 'd make a nice change . You 're lucky I 'm here at all . Keep still . Hit a beam and you 'll be trapped like your smelly friend . Mr. Redshirt , whatever the Tin Man 's paying you we 'll double it . Come on , you heard what Raa 'Keel said . He doesn 't want any witnesses . Do you think you 're gonna walk out of here alive with your share ? Don 't take the chance . Throw in with us . You 'll come out ahead . We 're the good guys . - Shut up , or I 'll give you a face full of ... Oh ! Here I am ! Ah ! Damn , he 's completely encased . Where 's that gizmo ? There . You know how this thing works ? I don 't know , just press the button . Watch where you point it . - Whoa ! Set it lower . There ya go . Prop him up so I can grill both sides . Oh , damn it . I 'm telling you , it couldn 't have been an attack . Probably just a pressure eruption on the surface . Nothing to worry about . Nothing to worry about ? If our transport 's damaged , we 're dead . Damn . Check the transport . What are you doing ? It 's too low . - No , no , it 's right . Give it more power . What are you doing ? - It 's not too low . Look , you 're gonna break ... - I think it 's out of juice . No , you 're breaking it . - And that , that is maxed out . It 's out of juice . - Oh , great . Okay , there 's another one of those canisters on the level up top . All right , go get it . Don 't drag your heels . Rygel 's going to die here on us . No , no , no , Rygel ! Rygel . Oh , crap . Eenie , meenie , minie , moe . Don 't even consider it , John . Oh ... - You know far too well , the shield belt doesn 't work against lava . Yeah , I figured that out . But it might work if it 's already activated . Far too risky . Look , I put Rygel in there , I 'm gonna have to get him out . He 's already dead . You don 't know that . The amber protects the crates . It might protect Rygel . How long has he been without air ? He 's amphibious . He can last . Would you quit buzzing around in my head ? You 're giving me a headache . Go . Okay . Ah ! Hmm ... Okay . At least we know I 'm insane . Raa 'Keel , transport 's fine . Not a scratch . Did you see anyone ? No . It had too be a bluff . Then what did this ? I don 't know . What 's the difference ? We 're getting out now before the Tarkans get back . Load up as much as you can . I 'll dispose of the hostages . Shh , we must hide . What did you think I was doing ? - Shh . Come on . Morons ... These are not real Tarkans at all . They 're highly evil men . Oh . Well , I wouldn 't have guessed . Come on , let 's get the others and get out of here . No , it 's not that easy . Our weapons are useless . No , we have to find the real Tarkans and tell them what 's happening . Send a message . - Right . Are you klemmpt ? Come here , come here , come here , come here . Hey , these are highly evil men , right ? Okay , Sikozu probably doesn 't even know how to work the radio , right ? Where are you going ? Frell her . All right Sparky , where are ya ? Come on , Bubba . I 'm too old to be playing hide-and-seek . Uh-oh . At least that works . Damn this has gotta be bad for the sperm count . Is that you ? Give me a bubble . Oh ! Okay , let 's get you some O2 . Nice use of the shield belt , but without that pathetic little weapon , you 'll burn ! You do not ... talk ... about ... Wynnona ... like that . Lift going down . Whoa , is that a head ? Prepare to feel fire ! Crichton ! Chiana ! Shoot ! Not him , me ! What ? Just shoot me ! Hey ! Keep shooting me . I gotta find Rygel . What 's going on ? Tell me wha ... Can I get a " Hell , yeah ! " ? Quickly , quickly . I 'm workin ' it . Hurry up ! Oh , hezmana . Whoa ! Man , somebody had something crawl up their ass and die . Damn , nobody light a match . Or breathe . Or move . No . No , wait . These are Tarkans . Good people . That 's would you said the last time . No , no , don 't worry . I 've told them all about them and us and the robbery and how we 're not their enemies . And they believed you ? Raa 'Keel . Once one of us . Now , just a traitor and a thief . Guess they believed her . You 're free to go . As long as you take him with you . Thanks for the belt . A pleasure . And thank you for the , uh ... Oh , jilnak . Ah , we 've gotta go . - Oh , my module is parked in orbit and the meter is running out . Oh . I 'll never eat again . The very thought of food nauseates me . Sork wings . Crispy grolack . - Excuse me . Excuse me . What is this mess ? And the smell ! This is all you . Well , from you . Whose idea was this ? Mine . D , why don 't we fire this thing up before the Tarkans realize that Grandma has poisoned them ? Merely a cleansing restorative . Not one word . Power systems at your command . A received transmission awaits your review . We have an answering machine . Have we got a message ? - Quick . Play it . Play it now . Just shut up . Ka D 'Argo . Moya and I have received your signal . Here is our location . We look forward to your return . It 's Pilot . Repeat , Moya and I have received your signal . Pilot . Oh ! By the yotz , Moya 's all right . She 's waiting for us .

 Crichton : Check this out . This memorial rocks . They designed these goggles so you can look back into the past at the old monastery . Come on . Check it out . D 'Argo : John , what are you talking about ? There is nothing here . You have to put the goggles on . Come on . Take a look . Put the goggles on . Do you want me to look ? Yes , through the goggles . ( whispers ) : Oh , my . Crichton : Pretty cool , huh ? Incredible . This sucker is a tear in time . It links to the past . It looks back to the actual moment when the event occurred . Now , check it out . This is the nurses surrendering to the Venek Horde . Can they see us ? I hope not . Keep watching . You 'll see the final attack on the monastery . This thing flicks back and forth between the attack and the truce . Aeryn : This recording device is accurate . I learned about this Jocacean Memorial . Well , need I say more ? If you learned about it at military school it 's certain to be farca . Five hundred cycles ago , 30 Peacekeepers lost their lives defending this monastery and Subofficer Dacon is one of our greatest heroes . Propaganda for morons . - I don 't believe ... Ah , ladies . Some decorum , please . This is a peace memorial . Let 's not kill one another . You 're wrong , you know . - Bullfrell . You 're wrong . - Bullfrell . You 're wrong . If you 'd only ... Subofficer Dacon stood right up there . The device says right up there . Guts pouring out everywhere , bleeding , and yet he still managed to initiate the peace process to save the nurses . Bullfrell ! Peacekeepers have always been a manifest military contagion that has raped and pillaged . They never died for any nurses . That 's just a silly little story to help naive children sleep at night . Do you know what would help me sleep better at night ? Do you want to hear ? - Stop it , girls , stop that . I 'm going to get this thing and stuff it so far ... D 'Argo : Stop it , okay ? Stop . Good . Rygel . Can we get out of here yet ? Chiana : D 'Argo , it 's Chi . No , no , no . We , we can 't leave yet . Pilot still needs another arn to fix condensers . I 'll let you know when he 's done . ( rattling ) Rygel : Oh ! What are you doing in Zhaan 's quarters ? You know why I 'm here . Same reason as you . And why am I here ? ( giggling ) : To steal whatever 's left . Yeah , that 's right . Well , we 're sensible , you and me . Leaving this to rot won 't bring Zhaan back . No . You can have whatever you find . I don 't want it . No . Neither do I. ( rock crashes ) Stark , let me show you something . Zhaan bought these . Bought them for me . I know . And you look great . You look like Astro Boy . Come on . Let me show you . But her voice is gone . It 's gone now . Come with me . Come on . With these , you can see 500 cycles into the past , as it 's happening , back to the moment when the nurses here were saved . Ah , I don 't want to , no , no . No , it 's okay . It 's a moment of peace . It 's the very thing Zhaan treasured most . Can you see it ? I can see ... I can see so much . So much death ! ( moaning ) ( Stark screams ) D 'Argo : Get that mask off of him . What are you doing to him ? - Stark ? ( screaming ) Crichton : I can 't see . I can 't see . Stark , are you all right ? Stark ? He 's breathing . What happened ? Oh ... Where the frell are we ? The old monastery . But how can that be ? We 're not wearing the goggles . This is outstanding . This is the finest simulation I 've ever seen . It 's so real . It 's so ... Incoming . Get down ! Get down . ( yells ) Crichton : D 'Argo , Jool 's hit . Jool ! ( screams ) Jool ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Right , move now ! Come on , in ! Don 't touch me ! My arm ! - If you don 't move , you 'll die . - Move it ! Move it ! Jool : Oh , I thought we were in a peace memorial . I got shot at a peace memorial . Shut up . What are you doing ? ( screams ) Stop screaming . Nice hit . All right , no weapons . Let 's figure out what 's going on here . Aeryn : I know exactly what 's going on . Someone is trying to kill us . You know , Aeryn , I think Stark 's mask might have pulled us sometime into the past . I kind of figured that one out . John 's right . If we change anything here , change the past , the future might not happen as it 's meant to . Then we won 't get back . - So , we don 't get back . But I 'm not dying just so that things don 't change . - Don 't move . Whoa , whoa , no weapons . No , don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Reinforcements . You received our distress call ? Yes , we did . Are you Subofficer Dacon ? No , Commanding Officer Tarn . Officer Sun , Subofficer Crichton Luxan is a mercenary . How did you get inside ? We rappelled down the cliff face . Only five of us made it but the Banik ... Five ? But we asked for hundreds of soldiers . The Veneks , there are thousands in the valley . Dacon , shut up , and get back up on the wall . Yes , sir . That is Subofficer Dacon ? Tarn : Nurse ! Any more reinforcements on the cliff ? Yes . - No . Maybe . All right . Now they 're jamming all pulse weapons so grab a spear and keep the bastards from getting in . ( moans and groans ) Ha ! Crichton : Hey , try not to kill anybody . I 'm not going to kill anyone . Oh , I might kill this guy . Dacon ! Oops , sorry . Don 't die . Don 't die . ( grunting ) Dacon : Officer Tarn ! What 's the matter , Pilot ? Why 'd you comm ? Have you heard from Crichton at the memorial ? Yeah , D 'Argo commed about an arn ago . He said Jool and Aeryn were tralk fighting . That seemed normal . Why ? What 's the matter ? Nothing . Just , when we arrived the automated orbit instructions were broadcast in Jocacean . Yeah , well it 's a memorial . But now , Moya received a request to lift orbit . This time , the broadcast was in basic Venek vernacular . Yeah , but didn 't the Veneks abandon the planet like 400 cycles ago ? That 's what I thought . Well , comm Crichton and D 'Argo . I 'll poke around in some frequencies and see what I can find . Woman ( whispers ) : Do you all know the sacrifice you have made ? Crichton : So , what does that recording device say ? Did we miss anything ? Aeryn : I don 't know . It says here that the Veneks attacked and all but one of the Peacekeepers were killed . And that happened . The boy you saved . Was he supposed to die ? Dacon ? No , he dies when he gets up there near dawn and sends back the ceasefire initiative to the Veneks . So Dacon 's supposed to be some kind of hero ? So I was taught . Anyway , according to this the leader of the Venek Corps , General Grynes , has just witnessed how this battle went , ascertained that there are only women and children remaining , and is out there now convincing the other generals to offer a ceasefire . So , it 's possible the time tear is still around here . We find it and let 's get out . I 'll get Jool and Stark and find the tear . Don 't frell things up when I 'm gone . You know , if we did change things , it is possible that we could improve the future . With our record , you think that 's gonna happen ? I guess not . I discovered something , by the way . I don 't know about yours but my pulse pistol is operational . ( beeping ) Yeah , mine , too . Their plasma frequencies must only work against primitive recharges . What about D 'Argo 's Qualta rifle ? It 's as old as most of the weapons around here . I doubt it 'll fire . This one 's still alive . Can you help me get him to the locker room ? Yeah , no problem , Opie . I just hope this was supposed to happen . So , you guys got any beer around here ? Beer , it 's like fellip nectar . Fellip 's a creature on Tarsis 6 . ( panting ) That hurts . Is that sterile ? Oh , God , I 'll probably get hekpus . Here , drink this . Why ? It will dull the pain . Oh , thank Blasma . ( gurgling ) At least maybe now , I might die of shock . That bitch just shoved the arrow right through . She ... Oh , hello . Hesca . Do you feel this ? Nothing . ( gasps ) Look ! This is great ! I 've got to get some of this to bring home . What is it ? One part water , nine parts fellip urine . ( gagging ) You made me drink piss ? D 'Argo : Okay . Okay , Jool . Let 's get out of here , away from the children . You can come with me , too . Dacon : In here , it 's about all this thing 's good for . Oh , basha , my frelling ... Sorry for cursing . - No , you okay ? Dacon , have you been a soldier long ? Were you talking to Officer Tarn ? No , it 's just that I once heard you killed a dozen Veneks when they breached the stak wall . Me ? - Mmm . Did you not also save the nurses ' convoy ? No , Officer Tarn did all that . He was a very noble man . He always gave credit away . He , uh ... Get down ! This ... Their snipers might see it . Who am I kidding ? I 'm not a soldier . I was attached to this unit as Comm Supervisor , and Sustenance Preparer . You were the cook ? Yeah . And with everyone getting killed , I was terrified I was gonna be ranking officer . I 'm so glad you turned up . Um ... no , uh ... Dacon , you know the engagement better than I do . You have to be the ... I 'm a cook . You gotta take over . You 're General Grynes , right ? Believe it or not , you don 't all look alike to us . You 're a man of compassion . Aren 't you ? At the Battle of Madazac , you offered a truce when you could have forced victory . How do you know that ? Read about you . Studied you . At , uh , school . Can you see the tear ? Moving , moving ... No , above us ... above us . I can see it , too , look . It 's yellow and ... Shut up , Jool . Where is it ? It 's coming ... it 's coming down . It 's coming down . It 's here . Now . - Okay . You go through it . I 'll go get the others . I 'm not going . ( groans ) Well , that was obviously wrong . What are you doing ? There is nothing there . Now , tell me , where is it exactly ? It 's here , here . Okay . ( screaming ) Mud ! You threw me in mud . - I 'll go get Crichton and Aeryn . I 'll be 30 microts . Can you hold ? Yes , yes . Bastards . They shot me , they punch me , they made me drink piss . ( gasping ) Oh , my Blasma . Stark ! It 's not the same here ! It 's not the same here , Stark . ( Jool screaming ) That 's the lie . It 's the lie . It 's what 's wrong . ( screams ) - Millions , billions , dead . ( moans ) ( yells ) Okay , now focus Stykeran . Where is the tear ? Ah ... - Uh-uh-uh-uh . Specifically . Find it yourself . You find it yourself . You will listen to me ! Tell me where the tear is , or I will use your face to create a new one . Stark , what 's the problem ? Jool went through , then we go through , and everything 's made right again . Oh , that 's the lie . That 's the lie . That 's what wrong . That 's the lie . Oh great . Yeah , we have to put up with this dren again . Oh , when the foul woman pierced the membrane back to our time , death . Jool 's dead ? Others . Thousands . Millions . Billions . Trillions . Yes , yes , all right . Very many . We get the idea . Not when we came through . The people you 're sensing weren 't dead before ? Oh , yeah . We did it being here . We changed the future . We don 't know that , John . Well , look at him . He knows it . Can 't we just go through and sort this out later ? We must do it here now . As Zhaan always says , " Do right by the wrong . Goddess helps us all along . " Feeling left out , D 'Argo ? We 're the only ones who don 't have voices in our heads . Well what are we gonna do if someone wants to know where Jool is ? Oh look , do you think anyone here cares about Jool ? Just tell them that she 's dead . Fine . Stick with Stark . I 've got an idea . It 'll set the timeline right and get us a ceasefire . Won 't work . - Yes , it will . No , it won 't . - You don 't even know what it is . Yes , I do . - No , you don 't . Oh yes , I do . - Oh , and what is your plan ? You 're ... you 're gonna use pulse pistols ? Kill all the Veneks you can ? Actually , yes . When they attack again , I 'll show you my way to get a ceasefire . God . You are gonna have to stay out of this room if you can 't stop shedding . Without renewal , there 's stagnation . Yeah ? Well , I feel the same way about men . But I don 't leave them lying around . Can 't you ever play nice ? I got shot with a hekpus infected arrow , you monochromatic little bitch . Pilot : Chiana , I believe Jool may not have overstated the situation , much to my surprise . These broadcast frequencies are static . What happened to them ? Well , I kept trying to tell you . Apparently , devastated by conflict . The planet is still inhabited , but by a bare fraction of the population from just a few arns ago . If you don 't like me , fine . But don 't treat me like I 'm nonexistent . Somehow we went back in time and the others are still there . And if you knew anything about linear continuity , you 'd realize what they 're doing back there now is affecting things on that planet . What minimal data stores I can access indicate a vicious war claimed millions of lives around 500 cycles ago . But that 's not what happened when we got here . They made peace . Dacon . Slowly take your finger off the trigger and point the weapon away from both of us . Those recruitment holochips never said anything about this . About what ? Fighting with primitive weapons ? Dying . Knowing you 're gonna die . Having time to think about it . Well as a soldier you don 't think about it . I 'm a cook . I like to think about food . Why did you join up ? I didn 't . You were born into service . Aboard a Command Carrier . No wonder you 're fearless . No . It 's easy to be fearless around here . This is what Peacekeepers are meant to do . Help the defenseless . You 'll be fine . Crichton : Why is this cloister so important ? Your superiors sent you into battle without an understanding of the antecedents ? You really are barbarians . No , we 're Peacekeepers . Barbarians butcher children . Yes , the Horde is bloodthirsty , and almost impossible to control . I 'm trying not to be a barbarian , and I 've never harmed a child in my life . Why is your army here ? My soldiers used to share the waters of the Krytlin River with the cities on the plateau . Now our supply has dried and we 're dying . So this is about water ? Inside this mountain is the source of the river . If we don 't gain access to it , the Horde will attack the cities and millions will die . But you , you want to offer a ceasefire . How do you know this ? Doesn 't matter . We accept your offer . But the Horde will not offer it while opposing soldiers are still here . We won 't be here . By the time you and your soldiers arrive , we 'll be gone . And why would you do this ? Same reason you 'll offer amnesty . We 're not barbarians . You give me your word you won 't harm the women and children , and I 'll get you out of here . There seems to be too many nurses here and not enough fighters . We were on a healing caravan when the Horde began the conflict . This detachment of Peacekeepers found us . We 're just here for our protection . Are the Peacekeepers contracted to defend your world ? They uphold all that 's good . It 's ironic . We might have been safer if they 'd never found us . ( chuckles wryly ) Do you know what the Horde does to children ? If they overrun us , and I 'm too weak , or unable , I 'd rather my girl were at peace than in their hands . Please ? I 'll depend on you . Why were you crying ? Because of all the pain . What 's your name ? Cyntrina . My father 's dead , and I never cried . This is humiliating . Yeah , bonnets are always a risk , but it 's the little touches that put you over the wall . I 'm not gonna get screwed here , am I ? Just don 't be here when we arrive . All of your soldiers must be gone . That 's the plan . The ground looks soft on the other side . All you got to do is drop down , hit the embankment and roll . Thank you . Yeah . Hey , General ? I 've got a good feeling about this . I think history is going to remember you as the maker of great peace . ( screaming ) - No . No ! No , no , no , no . Stand fast , traitor ! No , no , no , no ! You did not just do that ! You did not ! Please tell me you did not just do that ! I ask again , are you part of his deception ? No , Crichton 's actions are his alone . He told us nothing . Hey , folks . I 'm not the enemy here . We should kill him . No ! Too much killing . No more killing . Stop the killing . Stop . It 's worse , not better . It 's more dead . What 's he talking about ? Ah , nothing . Just what will happen to us if we don 't pull ourselves together . Crichton : That guy you shot ? He was their general . He wanted to offer you a ceasefire . I don 't believe you . Aeryn : Why didn 't you tell us anything ? There wasn 't time . - Oh , like frell there wasn 't . And since when do you make decisions for me ? Aeryn , we get him back to his lines and this war 's over . You know that . Liar , he 's a liar . No ! Don 't kill anyone else , Mother . Crichton : The Venek leaders want to offer you peace . They 're desperate for an excuse to offer you peace . Give them a sign and I promise , they won 't hurt you . ( shouts ) Jocacean civilians and Peacekeeper Militia , hear me . You will never know how close to salvation you came , how near lasting peace you brushed . The death of our general in battle we understand and accept . But to disgrace him in your females ' cloth ? You have the night 's stars to make peace with your deities . On the dawn , your severed heads will be nailed to the walls you defend . ( harmonica playing " Home on the Range " ) Ah , John . If this situation hadn 't reminded you of all those old Westerns you watched as a youth , I never would have heard that . Are you through ? Quite . The interlude , however , allowed me to ponder the question you ah , summoned me here to answer . And ? All modern research points to the elasticity of time rather than a brittle framework . Can it be corrected ? Hmm . If nudged closely enough to course , events have a way of restructuring themselves . If the participants are the same , the venues the same , the motivation 's the same , then well , the outcome is likely to be the same . So we have to find a way to kick start this thing . And soon . When the Horde attacks at dawn , events will vector further away from the reality you and I both know . Suggestions ? No . Not this time , John . There 's been so much change . What with you here , Grynes dead . I don 't want the consequences of catastrophic failure resting on my head . I 'm in a hell of a slump here , and everything I do just makes things worse . Well , then ... do better . ( harmonica playing " Home on the Range " ) We can record a message over the one sent by Colonel Lennok . And I have convinced Dacon into offering a complete and total surrender . It 's the only way to save the nurses . Maybe . You wanna better the odds ? - How ? Scroll through that digi-pamphlet you got at the Peace Memorial . Look for anything that may be out of sync that we can fix . What ? Oh what , you think I 'm ... I 'm stupid ? That I don 't understand what you 're saying ? Subofficer Dacon does not have to die . He 's Davy Crockett at the Alamo . He stands on the wall and takes one for the home team . I 've thought about this . It 's the only thing that I can come up with to fix the timeline . Oh , you and your stupid timeline . What , you think I wanna do it ? You think it 's my first option ? Read the history . It 's in your pocket . If Grynes lives , he 's a hero who averts a war . Dead , he 's just another guy in the Laura Ashley Spring Collection . It 's you and me now . We 've gotta do something . He 's not a soldier . I know that . But the way history unfolds that doesn 't stop him from taking an arrow . So ... Dacon dies . What about us ? We 're soldiers . We go back through the time tear . - The tear ? Stark says it 's completely disappeared . What happens if it doesn 't reshow ? Then we die half an arn after Dacon . Aeryn , either way he dies . And the nurses . That 's what we have to play for now . You deal with the dead ? Someone must . Death is where my expertise ends . When you shot the General how did you feel ? I felt hatred . Fear . Fear is good . Keep that . But travel light . Forget hate . If we die , will I be with my daughter ? After ? Different beliefs , different destinations . I cannot tell before the end . Should the worst befall , you will not be alone . Hello . You 're scary looking . You should have seen my father . My father wasn 't scary . My mother says , when loved ones die , we must remember them forever . Well , your mother is right . Do you think when I 'm dead , someone will remember me ? You know what ? I know a secret that will guarantee it . Make your mark . Carve it into the stone . That way in the future , anyone that reads it will think of Cyntrina . I 've offered unconditional surrender , just like you said to . And I 've also sworn that killing their general was a tragic mistake . But as Ranking Officer , are you sure you shouldn 't be the one on the message ? As a part of Special Commando Force , I 'm not officially here . So if they knew your unit was present it would escalate the conflict ? Mm-hmm . What are you doing ? I ... I 'm delivering the message . There ? You should shoot from down here . Ah , no , we only get one chance . I can 't have it go wrong and it needs to land right near their camps . You can 't expose yourself to their fire . Let me do it . I appreciate the gesture , but a soldier should do it . Better if a cook does it . Aeryn : I don 't want you to get hurt . Better me than you . ( sighs ) Subofficer Dacon ? You are a soldier . A brave hero . No . Heroes always get killed . I 'll be fine . ( girl screams ) How is that possible ? How is that possible ? Pilot : I don 't know , Chiana . But the planet is now lifeless . Moya 's sensors detect no microbial chemistry . What ? Nothing ? Krass me , it looks radiated . Pilot : The crater pattern indicates , in all probability , the destruction by military conflict . Rygel : But that can 't be . Can 't see it . I can 't see it . What do you mean , you can 't see it ? Look harder ! It 's not there . It was above us ! - It 's not there . It 's gone . It 's gone . How ? We did everything right . We set the timeline back on track . How can it be gone ? Oh , it 's not my fault . It 's no one 's fault . I ... I didn 't mean to ... - It 's not your fault . ( screaming ) The Veneks ! The Veneks ! Get down ! Cyntrina , come with me now . It didn 't work . Dacon 's dead , and the tear didn 't reappear . - Aeryn , untie me . You know , the device said that he died when he sent the ceasefire and then , and then the Veneks offered peace . Does that sound like peace to you ? Untie me . - I listened to you . I let a man die and we changed nothing . He was supposed to die . That 's what happened in history . But then why isn 't the tear back ? I don 't know ! Untie me . - Can we use our weapons now or are you still afraid to change things ? Yes , we can use the weapons . Untie me . Don 't touch him ! Crichton 's a soldier . He can help us fight . He 's a traitor . He tried to free that dog , Grynes . Grynes would have brokered a peace . What , you think they 're coming to offer peace ? We need him to defend the monastery . I won 't warn you again . If you try to release him , I 'll kill you . And if the Horde gets in here , they 're going to slaughter every single one of us . He can help us . How can he help ? He has a weapon like mine . Now if you 're gonna shoot , do it now . Your pulse weapons are functional ? Why haven 't you used them ? Well there 's a good question . Are you ready to get a ceasefire my way ? Killing Dacon should have fixed the timeline . Well , it didn 't . Are you ready ? Yes . Move ! Get to the walkway . Two guns , Aeryn . We only have two guns . Well make it look like more . - How ? Well , keep firing running backwards and forwards and pretend you 're an army . Oh yeah , that 's gonna work ! Just do it ! Now ! ( Crichton yelling ) Excuse me ladies , man with a gun coming through ! Pilot : Chiana , look out the forward portal . Not now , Pilot . Look out the portal . Rygel : Gone ! The planet , it 's gone ! Jool : It can 't be gone . I was just there two arns ago . I got shot . I drank piss . Chiana : Keeps the comms open . I 'm going out to look for them . There 's nothing there . It 's all gone . Where are you gonna look ? Hey , how 's that arm going ? Has the piss worn off ? Yes . Actually , it 's quite sore , thanks for asking . ( screaming ) And stop screaming . It is very , very irritating and I don 't want you melting anything . Nurse : Get away ! Get away ! Mother ! Stay put , Cyntrina ! D 'Argo : Leave her alone ! What are you doing ? I 'm making like an army . D 'Argo ! Whoa . Holy Montana ! Get to the Med Chamber . I 'm gonna have a heart attack . Aeryn ! ( horn blowing ) The Veneks are retreating ! ( horn blowing ) Chiana : What 's going on , Pilot ? I 'm getting the dren kicked out of me . Moya 's registering some kind of massive gamma disturbance where the planet used to be . Can you see anything ? Nothing . I can 't control this . Ohh ! It 's back . It 's back . No death , no death ! It 's back . It 's back . It 's back . No death . Come on . Now , quick . Aeryn : Let 's go . It will be safer if we just go now and don 't tell her anything . I 'll just be 30 microts . - Crichton . I won 't tell her anything . Are you leaving ? I will be leaving soon , yes . Will I ever see you again ? How long do your people live ? My mother 's sire lived for 700 cycles . Well , maybe I 'll see you again when you grow up . Crichton : We have to go . If you 're not here , the Veneks will murder us . No , no . If there 's no soldiers here they 'll offer a ceasefire . How do you know that ? I just ... do . Veneks are predators . They kill . That 's what they do . They don 't have ceasefires . Please . At least leave your weapons ... No . I ... I can 't . I 'm sorry . You 're gonna be safe . I promise . ( Stark groaning loudly ) Where 's Aeryn ? She should be here . She left ahead of me . Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Sorry . Okay , let 's get the frell out of here . ( screaming ) Chiana : On Moya , we registered every change as it happened . First , there were , there were millions dead . And then the planet disappeared , and then it came back . I almost crashed the pod trying to get it in here . And nothing changed on Moya ? No . Only the planet was affected by what you did . Everything 's the same except ... So is there any chance you can go back ? No . The tear is no longer stable . Stark tried , but he can 't get us back through . Does Crichton know that ? Yes , he does . So who 's gonna get him back on Moya ? I will . Okay . Thank you . Hi . I screwed up . You ... We did what we could . Why would they do that ? What 's the point ? There probably was no point . You must tell me . Where are the soldiers who were here ? I know nothing . They ... they just left . I don 't know where they went . They 're not here . - No one could get past my forces . Tell me where they are . I can 't control the Horde unless ... Crichton said they were going to escape by the cliffs but ... Too many Veneks have died here . The bloodlust is on them ! I need to give the Horde something . Where are the pulse weapons you fired on us ? ! Crichton took them . Please ... Please , I don 't know where they 've gone . I don 't know . I can 't stop the Horde unless you tell me where this Crichton is ! I don 't know . I don 't know ! Crichton ! No ! Not yet ! Crichton ! ( screaming ) ( gunfire ) No ! ( screaming ) ( sighs )

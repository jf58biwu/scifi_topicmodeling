 War ls the H Word Spider , Hubble , Nit ... . Big Pink ! The gum with the breath-freshening power of ham . And it pinkens your teeth while you chew . All right , sergeant , $ 1 00 of Pixie Stix and porno mags ... ... with your 5 percent military discount , comes to $ 95 . Forty cents . You forgot our 5 percent discount . Only for military people . What ? This is the worst kind of discrimination ! - The kind against me ! - Look , our policy is ... ... if for any reason you 're not satisfied , I hate you . Okay , now I 'm mad . Full price for gum ? That dog won 't hunt , Monsignor . Hello . We 're here because we love our planet . Sign here , patriots . You 'll get your discount cards . Can we use the cards to buy gum , then quit the Army ? Playing you all for chumps ? Correct . There 's no obligation . Unless , of course , war were declared . - What 's that ? - War were declared . Be careful , Fry . If you kill anyone , make sure to eat their heart ... ... to gain their courage . Their rich , tasty courage . I don 't want you to worry about your jobs . That 's why I 'm firing you now . I want to enlist . They always die if I 'm not there . Sorry . The Army 's policy is men only . - What ? - Shameful , I agree . In the old days , I proudly fought with female troops , shoulder to shoulder . After some deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues ... ... and harmless pinching , the Army decided women weren 't fit . - Not when I 'm in charge . - Someone should teach you a lesson . If it 's a lesson in love , I suffer from a very sexy learning disability . - What do I call it , Kif ? - Sex-lexia . Men , you 're lucky . Soon you 'll be fighting for your planet . Many of you will die for it . A few will be forced through a fine mesh screen . They 'll be the luckiest . - Great . We 're gonna die . - And this ham gum is all bones . Now , to present the logistics of our mission ... ... welcome the original Gerber Baby ... ... Earth President Richard M. Nixon . This is the brass ring , fellas . - Planet Spheron One . - Cool effect ! A desolate , ugly planet ... ... with no natural resources or strategic value . Questions ? - Why is this planet worth dying for ? - Can 't say , you 're the one who 'll die . So we 'll know , who 's the enemy ? We know nothing about their language ... ... history , or appearance . But we can assume this : They stand for everything we don 't stand for . Also , they said you look like dorks ! They look like dorks ! I 'm gonna- - What 's the matter , private ? Tent got your tongue ? Kif , write that down and send it to Humor in Uniform . That guy makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales . That recruit is phenomenal ! Yes . He edged out my old mark by two seconds . And 1 6 minutes . And 1 2 hours . I do plan to finish someday , Kif . Good hustle , soldier . Sorry , sir . I was still in attack mode . You know how testosterone is . As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones , I sure do . - What 's your name , private ? - Lee , La , Man . La Man . Lemon ! Lee Lemon , sir . Lemon , you 're a man 's man . A man 's man 's man . More importantly , your hand , while firm and manly ... ... is soft as a velvet child . What 's your lotion ? Pert and Popular . Roger that . Get me 1 0 cases of Pert and Popular . What about your Jergens ? Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows . Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I 've ever seen . That young man fills me with hope . And some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing me . Hello . Now that 's a nice ros√© . Anyway , we open up the panda crate and the thing 's dead . Upchucked its bamboo . True story . That 's whatever you were talking about for you . - Mind if we sit with you ? - Why the hell would I ? We 're all guys here . Sweaty , hairy , gassy guys . - Good point . I guess . - You 're my kind of soldier . A foul-mouthed , barrel-chested , beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle . - Who 's got a special lady back home ? - I have a thing for this girl at work . Really ? What type is she ? Blond , or Chinese , or Cyclops ? - Cyclops . - She sounds sweet . But sweet girls aren 't for you . You hard-fighting , hard-farting , ugly son of a- - Stop flattering me ! Ten hut ! Well , well , well . If it isn 't Lee Lemon ... ... the flaming star of Brannigan 's Rough Rangers . Lemon , do you like to read ? I got a great book on tape . It 's about life in ancient Greece . Sir , the alarm ! I think I 'd better- - Don 't talk . Just go . We 're now in position above Spheron One . This is the moment we trained for all yesterday afternoon . Now , the battle plan . The key to victory is the element of surprise . Surprise ! It 's creepy . This is the worst part . The calm before the battle . - And then the battle 's not so bad ? - Right , I forgot about the battle . - What 's happening ? - Holy shoot ! Look ! The enemy ! They 're balls ! - Charge your gun , Fry ! - Right . Watch where you 're shooting , private ! You spooked Felicity . - Give this to my son . - You got it ! Wait . I didn 't tell you where he lives . Your son might also like those boots . Cover us , buddy ! You got the only wounded-up positron shooter ! Fry , you emu-bellied coward ! Bender , no ! If they put me on a stamp , tell them to use the young Bender . Incoming wounded ! All personnel , report to operating tent four ! I mean , five ! Repeat , four . Ready to operate ? I 'd love to . But first , I have to perform surgery . I kid . I kid . Scalpel . Blood bucket . - Priest . Next patient ! - Leave some for the enemy to kill . Leave him alone ! He has twice your training . Yeah , he 's a doctor and a butcher . This is how it starts . First jokes , then the heavy stuff . When will the killing end ? Look at this sissy . While others fought and died pointlessly ... ... he was hiding , wallowing in his own cowardice . - That wasn 't cowardice . - I 'm depromoting you . Kif , what 's the most humiliating job ? - Being your assistant . - Wrong ! Being your assistant . Private , henceforth , you 'll be Kif 's assistant . - That 's not bad . - You speak when I say so , worm ! - I 'm afraid he 's gone . - Doc , I ain 't dead ! - Excuse me , I believe I 'm the doctor . - Believing it won 't make it true . It isn 't a war . It 's a murder . It isn 't war , it 's murder ! Bender , old buddy , hang in there ! Here lies the bravest soldier I 've ever seen since me . I order that he be melted down and made into a statue of himself . Slow down , I 'm up to something here . I want this robot fixed . Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1 960 election . - Damn bean-eating war hero ! - Ready to operate , doc ? I 'd love to . But first , I have to perform surgery . That 's my joke ! I 'll kill you ! Prewar scotch . - Welcome , lieutenant . Looking sharp . - I got wheels ! With clickity-clackers ! Where 's the little umbrella ? It 's what makes a scotch on the rocks ! Actually , sir- - Make me a new one . Use a brush , you dunderhead ! And mix these mixed nuts ! I see two almonds touching ! Listen , this war is in danger of going all quagmire on me . So I am sending you on one last mission . Hot diggity daffodil ! A mission of peace . You 'll negotiate with their leaders , the Brain Balls . They 've got lots of brains and lots of chutzpa . Joining you is our top peace negotiator , Henry Kissinger . - How are you ? - Is he any good ? Looking like that , he talked his way into Jill St. John 's bed . A little lower . Lower . Lower . A lot lower . Too low ! Lower . Private Lemon ! No need to leave . My stall just became free . Maybe you should put on a towel . Right . I 'm trying the new lotion you recommended . If I accidentally put too much on my hands , I could rub it on you ... . Brannigan ! My God , cover yourself . I didn 't live 1 000 years to look at another man 's gizmo . Sorry , Mr. President . I didn 't realize . Kif , raise him up nipple high . Stuff yourself into a uniform . We have to leave before the bomb goes off . Bomb ! What bomb ? The doctors put it in that gullible robot . Zapp ! Zapp ! lnspect the troops later . It 's time to activate the bomb . Now ask for economic cooperation . Excuse me . Attention ! Everyone , evacuate the planet immediately ! Not because it 's meatloaf night . Come , Lemon , before this dump blows up . Could you say when the bomb is exploding ? Sure , my significant soldier . It 's voice-activated . It 'll detonate when the robot speaks a certain word . What 's the word ? Sir . It 's the one word the robot uses most . We got it from this database of his 1 0 most frequently used words . Number 1 0 : " CHUMP " Number 9 : " CHUMPETTE " Number 8 : " YOURS " Number 7 : " UP " Number 6 : " PIMPMOBILE " Number 5 : " BITE " Number 4 : " MY " Number 3 : " SHINY " Number 2 : " DAFFODIL " And Bender 's most frequently uttered word ... ... the word which can destroy this planet : - " ASS " - We don 't have long ! We demand bouncing , followed by rolling of the third type . What ? My chair 's too hard . It 's a pain in the- - What do you call it ? Lower back ! That whole region . I got to break that gate , beat up the guards ... ... steal that chopper and rescue Bender . - I did it ! Wait , that 's not me . - Come on ! We got to save Bender ! - You want to save him ? Why ? - Fry , don 't you recognize me ? - Hermes ? - Lee , when will I see you again ? You two are good friends ? But I thought we would be good friends . Let 's see how friendly you get when you 're sharing a prison cell . Hey , Zapp ? - Leela ! - So it 's you I 've been attracted to ! I 've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman . Let 's do it again sometime . The elders tell of a young ball like you . He bounced 3 meters in the air . Then 1 .8 meters in the air . Then he bounced 4 meters in the air . Do I make myself clear ? Mr. Ambassador , our people tell the same story . These balls are making me testy ! If they don 't stop bouncing , I 'll shove this treaty up their- - - Where do you shove things up a ball ? - Not a productive area of discussion . We 're here . I followed the bouncing balls . I 'll keep a safe altitude . You parachute down . My friend 's life is at stake . I can finally prove I 'm not a coward . - Will you push me ? - I already did ! Thank you ! At last , war has made me into a man . Gentlemen , we must put an end to the bloodshed . We 've seen too many body bags and ball sacks . We can 't allow bouncing of the seventh variety . No more crap ! I 'm catching the next pimpmobile out ! But before I go , I have one thing to say . - Bite my shiny metal- - - Stop ! You can 't say the next word ! Up yours , chump ! I said it 906 times before lunch . If you say the A-word , you 'll blow this planet straight to the H-word . Young man , you have the bravery of a hero . And breath as fresh as a summer ham . - What 's funny ? - Bender 's got the upper hand now . The game 's name is : Make Bender Happy , or He Blows Up the Planet ! I 'd rather die and kill everybody than sit here listening to these idiots ! Stay calm . No need to bounce off the handle . - That 's it , I 'll say it ! A is for- - - Wait ! Stop ! We give in to all demands . The war is over . Our home planet is yours . All right ! - Wait ! We 're invading your planet ? - Correct . I guess you learned a valuable lesson . Don 't mess with Earth ! - May you bounce in peace . - Get the hell off my planet ! Well , that 's it . Let 's reactivate him . Wake up ! Chumps and chumpettes ! ls the bomb out ? - Can I say the word I love to say ? - Sorry , we couldn 't remove it . It 's stuck in there with glue or something . Great . What 's the point of living if I can 't say " ass " ? I didn 't blow up ! Ass , ass , ass , ass ! I 'm back in the saddle ! We couldn 't disarm it . We changed the word . A word you almost never say . - That 's using your ass . And the word ? - Better if you don 't know . Come on , I 'm not going to say it . Please ? - Is it " please " ? - No . - Words I never say . I know , " thanks " ! - Stop trying to destroy the world . Wait . Is it " sorry " ? No . " Funderful " ? - " Nonalcoholic " ? - Quit ! Enough already . " Compassion . " " Shrimp toast . " " Antiquing " ? I 'm all right .

 Anthology of Interest 2 There . I 've finished fine-tuning my What If Machine . It can answer any " What if , " accurate to one-tenth of a plausibility unit . That 's so plausible ! Who wants to see an alternate reality ? I want to know what would happen if I were human . Being a robot 's great , but we don 't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad . Oh , Lordy Lou , there he goes again ! Well , let 's give baby what he wants . What if Bender were human ? Good news ! I 've invented a way to turn Bender into a human using the process I call reverse fossilization . How does it work ? In regular fossilization , flesh and bone turn to minerals . Realizing that , it was simple to reverse the process . I 've already tested it by turning the toaster into a raccoon . Kind of gamy . Ready , Bender ? I don 't know . I 'm beginning to have some second thoughts ... Cover your shame , mon ! It worked ! Eat it , everyone who 's never won a Nobel Prize ! And that includes you , Amy . So this is a human body , huh ? Neat ! Hey ! My antenna 's gone ! Nah , it just moved . I 'm not getting good reception on it , though . Maybe if I wiggle it around ... No ! You 'll make God cry ! Well , let 's see what kind of things this body can do . Hey , that 's pretty fun ! Being human is great ! Hooray ! It 's just like Mardi Gras . Come into the bathroom and look at this ! You won 't believe it ! Bender , it 's okay to be proud , but don 't be a showoff . You look a lot better than you used to . You 're not so bad yourself , big boy . Hey , that felt great ! Nah , it 's not working anymore . Speak for yourself . Whoa , this is awesome ! - You drank and smoked as a robot . - But now it 's bad for me ! Woo ! Speaking of which , try these nachos . Why didn 't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good ? What 's going on ? That rhythm , it 's doing something to my human butt ! Bender , part of being human is having self-control . I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time ! - No , Bender ! - Stop him ! - Just let me go ! - No ! Come , Bender . It 's time to go home and rest . I need you in top shape when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee . Bender ? Goodbye moderation ! Is Bender still missing for a week ? Where is he ? As I 've said before , I used reverse fossilization which is the reverse of regular , uh , eh ... We found him ! Ah ! Then without further stalling for time , I present to the Nobel judges the first robot ever turned into a human ! My God ! He needs medical attention ! Pulse , 300 . Liver , failing . Cholesterol , 40 ? - Well , that 's not so bad . - No , I mean 40 pounds ! This scientific breakthrough heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations . Yes . Come here and give old Bender a kiss . Hey , you like grilled cheese ? And , uh , that 's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize . Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this man-ball upon the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science ! Wait ! As men of science , are not your minds open to new ideas ? I say , do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves . Young man , you 've opened our minds and swayed our hearts . Let us therefore ... Party ! Hey , everybody ! - Party ! - Woo-hoo ! Party ! Bender , you were right . You 've lived more in one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives . Woo ! And so , to recognize your achievements I hereby award you the Nobel Prize in , uh , Chemistry . Care to say a few words ? He 's dead . When did he die ? About twelve hours ago when the party started . But he just said " Woo ! " No , that was air escaping from the folds of his fat . Woo ! Good night , sweet prince . You were the greatest man any of us will ever know . Let 's get him out of here . He 's starting to smell up the joint . Woo ! Woo ! Woo ! You watched it . You can ' t un-watch it . Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest . Who else has a question for the What If Machine ? Scruffy ? Katrina ? Xanfor ? I 'm good at video games and bad at everything else . I wish life was like a video game . Can you say that as a question ? What if that thing I said ? Oh , great machine , we beseech thee . What if life were more like a video game ? Hello , ignorant pigs . Drop your crack pipes and your beer bongs and watch as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of Planet Nintendu 64 . Wait . I know that monkey ! His name is Donkey ! Monkeys aren 't donkeys . Quit messing with my head ! I 'll just put the old John Q. Nixon on it . There . No major crap-ups . You 're on , Mr. Ambassador . What the ... ? Mama Mia ! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace ! Mr. Fry , you know the secrets of the video game " Chance . " Step into the War Room . You 're meeting with General Colin Packman . What can you tell us about the Nintendians ? I spent all of ninth grade studying them except the day my eyeballs started to bleed , and in my opinion ... Quickly ! To the escape tunnels . This way , damn it ! Delicious ! Just like stale marshmallows ! And a cherry ! Hey , watch out ! - Uh-oh ! - Oh , my God ! He ate Fry ! Fry is dead ! It 's okay ! I had another guy ! Invaders , possibly from space ! People of Earth , I am Lrrr of the Planet Nintendu 64 . Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships . All right . It 's Saturday night . I have no date , a two-liter bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix tape . Let 's rock ! We 're losing ships . What should I do ? Increase speed , drop down and reverse direction ! I 've still got a trick or two up my sleeve . Watch as I fire upwards through our own shield ! He 's a madman ! A madman ! It 's working ! Victory 's assured ! My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter ! I 'm hit ! So cold . No ! Amy , tend to the Widow Packman . Drop down and increase speed ! One ship is left only ! - Come on , Fry ! Get it ! - It 's moving too fast ! I could never get the last one ! My brother always got it for me ! Drop down ! Reverse direction ! Prepare for landing ! You are defeated ! Instead of shooting where I was , you should have shot where I was going ! All your base are belong to us . - What do you monsters want ? - One thing , and one thing only : Quarters ! A million allowances worth of quarters ! No slugs or tokens ! Fork them over ! Forget it , you pixelated pirates ! We need quarters to do our laundry ! - Yeah ! - Right on ! But space invaders need to do laundry , too . Look at Donkey Kong . Have you smelled his loincloth ? - Yes . - Go away ! We 're not giving you our quarters ! What if we put our laundry in with yours ? Would that be okay ? - I guess so . - Okay , that settles that . But if this cape shrinks , consider your species extinct ! Bravo ! That 'll be hard to top ! I pity the next Tale of Interest ! Well , there 's time for one last question . Let 's turn to the Who Asked Machine to see who 's next . Amy . I mean Leela . As an alien who was abandoned on Earth I 've never really belonged anywhere . Boo-hoo ! Ow ! So my question is this : What if I found my true home ? Ow ! Where are we ? Nibbler , I don 't think we 're in New New York anymore . Jeez , apparently the phrase " Tone it down " doesn 't exist on this planet . Oh , no ! We hit someone ! Quick , back into the ship ! Nice boots . Yuck ! Look , everyone ! She killed the Man-Witch of the West ! A witch ? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet ! No , you stole them . We saw you ! Well , it 's hard to find shoes that fit me . Who are you people ? Haven 't I seen you in some copyrighted movie ? We resemble but are legally distinct from the Lollypop Guild , the Lollypop ... Greetings ! I 'm the Cute Witch of the North ! Can anyone fix my ship so I can go ? Ask the Professor . He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard . - You mean that Yellow Brick Road ? - The city council re-named it in 1 975 . - Those are great shoes ! - Oh , thank you . Do they come in women 's sizes ? Crow , prepare to be scared . " Then , the car honked its own horn ! " A talking scarecrow . Want to come with us to see the Professor ? - He might give you a brain . - Hey ! That 's not nice to say . Beer ! Beer ! Whiskey okay ? Are you off to see the Professor ? 'Cause I could use a heart . A human heart . I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement . And I 'm the other guy . Courage . Not enough of it . Need some from what 's-his-name . Damn this DSL ! Fly , my stupids ! Fly out and get them ! You promised you 'd bake monkey cake today ! By " monkey cake , " I meant your ass ! We 've been skipping for hours .

 Here ! Here 's your change . Get in line ! So now ... I 'd like to go over again why we 're here today . Tenmo festival lecture , number three ! Today , I would like to show you a video recording of the past in order for you to gain a greater understanding of this town 's festival ... Hey ! You right there ! Stop yawning ! But it 's crowded , humid and stuffy in here . Just deal with it . This is the only place we can use because of equipment issues . On top of that , the air conditioner is out of order . Narita , why don 't you go outside and get some fresh air ? No ! We 're going to be starting soon ! Fine , whatever ... but why are there so many people here ? I came because Ha-chan invited me . Atsushi invited me . Me too . You guys ... Sorry . I didn 't think so many people would show up . You guys are being irresponsible by inviting people who aren 't involved ! But I came because you invited me , Jirou . Me too . Same goes for me ! I ... Inagaki , is it ready yet ? Coming , coming . Almost ! There . It 's in a really old data format , so it 's a big pain to get it to show up on the monitor ! Okay . How 's that ? It 's good to go . Okay ! So let 's get started ! But before that , I 'd like to go over again why we 're here today . The Tenmo festival lecture ... That 's enough already !

What are you saying ? How was the festival lecture ? Cancelled . The video I was going to show turned out to be something totally different ! Where 's Hachiyou ? He 's still in the PA room . I have to go give Mr. Yamamoto a piece of my mind ! " This is a archive video of the festival ... " Yeah right ! What 's with her ? I don 't know . The festival was a movie ? Yes ! The video I borrowed from you ! " Social Studies Archive Video : Tenmo Shrine Descension . Running time thirty minutes . " " Please use the appropriate machine to play this video , as it is in an antiquated format . " That was written lengthily on the packaging but it turned out to be something totally different ! Oh , the old video I lent you yesterday . What was on it ? A movie ! A movie ? Look at you two sweethearts ! S ... Stop it ! Someone ... Someone help us ! Anyone ! What the heck was that ? Seems like it 's a hit . This is what 's on the video you lent me ! Wait a minute ! Isn 't that the head of the Sanemori Clan ? Grandma Momoe as a middle schooler ? Independent Film Festival Made in 1970 Independent Film Festival Made in 1970 It says 1970 , so it 's from exactly one hundred years ago ! A hundred years ? You 're a bastard , sea ! Fin Oh , that brings back memories ! Really ? My old independent film was on it ? Why was it on there ? I don 't know either . But the students are ecstatic about it . They 're going to do another showing now . Dear , dear . What 's going to happen with the Festival Club ? Yeah , well , the thing is ... only Nayuta Moriyama seems bothered by this . Oh my ... But I thought Nayuta was against the Festival Club ? She was . But now she 's the one lighting a fire under Murata and Hachiyou 's butts . Where 's Hachiyou and Nayuta ? I forgot to tell you . They 're running late , because the festival lecture is still going on . Again ? So , I 'd like to explain why we 're here today . We accidentally discovered an independent film from a hundred years ago . We 're going to be doing an impromptu screening , because it was really interesting . Yeah yeah ! I think this is a good opportunity , so from now on we 'd like to show archive videos of Tenmo occasionally . There 's a saying , " Visit the old and learn the new . " The Festival Club 's objective is similar to that , so I think it 's fine . You guys are advertising the Festival Club at the video screening ? How clever and crafty of you , Hachiyou . No , this is Murata 's idea . Oh ? Inagaki , please turn it on . Sure thing ! Ahh , how irritating ! Oh , am I intruding again ? W ... What are you saying ? What 's wrong , Nayuta ? I can 't find the videos ! I 've looked in the library and in the archive room , but I can 't find the videos about the festival ! Will someone explain to me why ? On top of that , Hajime and the rest were like ... " It 's all right , because today we 'll do a screening of that movie " . So I 'm going to go home and get it from my house right now ! Get what ? The official video recordings ! The video on the Shrine Descension that belongs to the Moriyama household ! That 's what I should have done in the first place ! See you ! Off I go ! Thanks for doing the student government work ! What 's with her ? Hajime ... perhaps ? No , it 's nothing ... Am I intruding too ? S ... Shut up ! Wait , you bastard ! I can 't really do that , can I ? What ? It 's over already ? It 's a movie , but it 's short . It 's only maybe twenty minutes long . We showed it twice and ended it . Why didn 't you drag it out more ? I went all the way home to get this video . Well ... It 's okay . There 's always a next time . With Inagaki 's help , we 've decided that the Festival Club will have video screenings once in a while . We 're going to be showing interesting video footage of Tenmo , old and new ! It 's a great idea ! As the media committee president , I 'm totally for it ! Oh , really ... By the way , Nayuta ... Why are you suddenly so enthusiastic about the Festival Club ? You were against its participation in the Cultural Festival . Th ... That 's because ... Because ... Murata ! Will you come with me ? Hikaru , take these and put them somewhere for me please . S ... Sure . Wait ... Hey ! Muryou Subaru , you come too ! Yes , yes . One " yes " will do ! For the people of Tenmo to change , it 's necessary to cooperate with our friendly neighbors ... Like those three . Am I a friendly neighbor too ? That 's right . I 've been in and out of the student government office so much today . How impressive , Vice President . Save your compliments . Sorry to intrude again ! Huh ? Where 's Kyoichi and Harumi ? They went home . Together ? Uh-huh . " Kyoichi , would you like to walk home together ? " " I 'd like to talk to you . " " W ... What ? S ... Sure ! W ... We 'll do that then ! " ... was how the conversation went . Harumi asked him ? That 's unusual . Which means , the two are getting closer ! How can they get closer when they 've known each other since they were kids ? You 're such a dummy . Those two were close , but were distant at the same time . So what 's going on with you ? You 're with the two guys you hate so much . It 's a momentary cease-fire ! Go on , sit down , you two . Yes , yes . One " yes " will do ! Yes ! Harumi , where are we going ? It 's only a little further . It 's been eleven years since then ... Eleven years ? Since you and I met . Oh yeah , you 're right . Since that tragedy you 've become strong . That 's why I 'm going to show you what I 've inherited . Inherited ? H ... Hey ! Harumi ! Where are we ? This is the place of sorrows . Eleven years ago , the people of Tenmo used the secret craft of Astral Deviation to destroy an invading alien on the far side of the moon . It can 't be ... Is this the place ... This is where your father and mother were killed . Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Konaya Konaya Welcome ! Hi there . What do you want ? An order of shiratama animitsu please ! Coming right up ! We can 't predict our future . Plus , there 's also the recent string of alien invasions to consider ... And as for space diplomacy , the Sanemori meetings are going nowhere ... You 've already lost your younger brother , I doubt you want to lose your son . What are you trying to say ? Gozen Jiruko Inaka Jiruko Zensai Anmitsu Mitsumame Mame Kanten Tokoro Ten Ozouni Nikomi Zousui Isobe Maki Abe Kawa Cream Anmitsu Gozen Jiruko Inaka Jiruko Zensai Anmitsu Mitsumame Mame Kanten Tokoro Ten Ozouni Nikomi Zousui Isobe Maki Abe Kawa Cream Anmitsu Would you like to become an accomplice ? Gozen Jiruko Inaka Jiruko Zensai Anmitsu Mitsumame Mame Kanten Tokoro Ten Ozouni Nikomi Zousui Isobe Maki Abe Kawa Cream Anmitsu What ? Gozen Jiruko Inaka Jiruko Zensai Anmitsu Mitsumame Mame Kanten Tokoro Ten Ozouni Nikomi Zousui Isobe Maki Abe Kawa Cream Anmitsu I 'm about to go meet with someone . Would you like to come with me ? Someone ? Baku ! Hiya ! Hi , Mr. So . He 's the " someone " ? He 's Planet Sopal 's diplomat ! I 'll be guiding the two of you . Excuse me , sir ! Can we get the shiratama anmitsu we just ordered to go ? Remember how I told you before , that the people of Tenmo receive the incantation when they 're still kids ? Yeah . The incantation that Murata received ... I was bedridden for three days after I received the incantation . I had a fever and headaches . The universe was going in circles in my head . It 's strange not to at least have a fever . I was gone for a whole week . Shun ! Yours was mostly laziness ! I was sick for real on the first two days ! You didn 't have a fever or anything right ? Huh ? I did lose some sleep , though . Murata is an exception ! Oh . Then the festival ... The Shrine Descension ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Washoi Washoi Washoi ... Lady Momoe ! My daughter ! Nayuta has the power ! It 's the color of Shingu ! She has the power of Shingu ! The things that are circling inside your heads are the very , very condensed vast memories of the stars . The memories of the stars are the history of the Galactic Federation . People 's emotions and knowledge from a very long time ago were all squeezed into these tiny memories . The incantation forces these things you 've never seen or heard of into your head . I 'm very proud of how you all coped with it . My head hurt after it . I was only able to eat one bowl of rice ! After that , I was able to use the power of Shingu . Shun developed the ability to move fast . Hachiyou developed the ability to manipulate gravity . Kyoichi developed the ability to harness our powers . So the Shrine Descension isn 't an ordinary festival . That 's right ! It 's a ceremony to pick out people to fight , like us ! That 's why it must stop ! It 's a ceremony that shouldn 't take place ! This is a place that shouldn 't exist . So , space is distorted here . A tragedy that shouldn 't have happened , happened eleven years ago because of my father . You 're wrong ! Your father did his best to save my father ! He fought for them ! Kyoichi ... It 's the aliens ' fault your mother and father died . Everyone fought hard ... and died ... But they were able to fulfill their duty . Don 't blame Mineo . There 's no one in this town that blames Kenji ! The same goes for me ! Your father is a great man ! No , my father was overcome by his emotions and was unable to defeat the enemy . He hesitated in his attacks because he was undisciplined and thus lost his friends at the hands of his enemy . Why are you ... Why are you always like that ? Why do you always look like you know it all ? Why ? Why do you look at me like that ? Because I know . You 're lying ! Don 't lie ! I know . That 's a lie ! I 'm telling the truth . I love you too . Because I love you , I 'm going to accept the facts . That 's what I decided , on the night of the Shrine Descension . Your ... Your power awakened then ? I gained the ability to use my powers , but in return , I felt my father 's grief vividly . The anguish and regret he felt from his dear friends ' lives being taken away before his very eyes are still circling inside my head . Is that why ? Is that why , all this time , you ... Murata , Subaru and Subaru 's sister ... They taught me something . The sorrows I 've inherited are not something I 'm only supposed to endure ... I 'm supposed to triumph over them , and ... You idiot ! No , I 'm the idiot ! If I had only paid more attention , I would have realized it ! That the tomboy started acting mature , and would always talk about her " duties " ... You 'd never said things like that before ! I didn 't question it , and for years , I ... I ... I 'm sorry . Thank you ... for telling me . Where are you taking me ? We 're going to join the discussion table . We 're basically playing both sides . If we do it right , we won 't be held accountable . We might even be thanked . Are your windows closed ? Yes , yes . Put the pedal to the metal ! Okay ! There it is . Jo , are you all right ? Th ... This is ... ! This is Mr. So . This is Mr. So . Bring me in , please . Roger . Ready ... Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Get 'em . There . There 's someone here who wants to see you , sir . Huh ? Who ? They 're from Tenmo , members of the Sanemori Clan . Sanemori ? Oh ... It 's about time , Mr. So . I 've been waiting . Go ! I 'm beat . Now you understand , right ? Festivals have a special meaning to the people of Tenmo . I finally understand why you were against the Festival Club . If that was the case , you should have just explained it to us . What did you say ? I thought Hachiyou had already told you ! Ahh . To the end of a tragic love that almost was ... But , I don 't think we have to emphasize the fighting aspect of it . What do you mean ? It 's true that nothing has changed for me since I 've received the incantation , but ... I felt it ! It was cool , but warm ... It was a really nice feeling . What 's that supposed to mean ? I don 't know . I thought , the universe was waiting for us . I mean , the universe is so vast ... The Shrine Descension , the special powers and such , are actually things to test us . They aren 't the main objective . But , I only started to think like this after I received the incantation . Hey , does that mean I 'm being affected by it ? Awesome ! That 's not an ability ! Damn . Now that I think of it ... What is it ? How did you get your power ? Did your village have something ceremonial , similar to the incantation or the Shrine Descension ? Nothing at all . Before I knew it , I already had it . Don 't be stupid . Stupid , isn 't it ? Muryou ... We saw a movie , saw another movie , and listened to what Moriyama said . It seemed like an ordinary day , but there were a lot of things we gained and learned . To be continued in the next episode . To be continued Next Episode I 'm Kyoichi Moriguchi ! I 'm Harumi Mineo . H ... Harumi ! I ... Yes ? No ... Nothing ...

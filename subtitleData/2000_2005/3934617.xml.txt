 Don 't stick ! Don 't stick ! Uh , what 's cooking , Marguerite ? Don 't mind the smoke , it 's perfectly normal . Where there 's smoke there 's fire . Eggs , bacon , toast . Just the way you like it . Well done . Looks delicious . Good heavens ! What 's all the smoke about . Breakfast . Oh yes , of course . Marguerite , this looks fantastic . With Malone off to proving himself and ... Veronica still missing , I 'm doing all the cooking around here ! But go ahead boys , and enjoy . I 'm finished for the day . I have some reactions I need to monitor down in the lab . So I 'll take mine with me . And then what ? Well , you may not be much of a cook , but the effort is certainly appreciated . What kind of backhanded compliment is that ? I 'm sorry , Marguerite , You 're a wonderful cook . And well , hell , even the great chefs of Europe burn a ... piece of toast once in a while , don 't they ? That 's a little better . I 'll tell you what . I 'll cook tonight , and you can criticise , hmmm ? You know I never complain about your cooking . Oh ! That 's true enough . But you never eat it either . Baked pterodactyl , poached raptor . What a feast we 'll have . Sounds disgusting already ! Oh , I wouldn 't eat it either ! The man who tamed Marguerite Krux . Worthy of a medal I would imagine . Damn some people never learn . Roxy , boy , you 've done it again ! Who are you ? What do you want ? You 've cheated me for the last time , John Roxton . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World No ! you can 't take me . I 'm still alive . That 's the problem . What the ... ? What kind of a trick is this ? I am death and this is my domain . Oh I see , But I don 't believe I belong here . And if this has anything to do with those warriors , - well , I beat them fair and square . - You did indeed . But you won 't beat me again . - We 'll see about that . - You cannot leave ! Dammit , you 're stronger than you look ! - There 's no escape . - Am I dead ? - Is that what you 're trying to tell me ? - Not yet . But you will be when the game is done . Game ? Look look , I 'm not playing any game with you ! Oh I think you will . You see it is not just your life that hangs in the balance , it 's the lives of your friends as well . You can damn well leave my friends out of this ! You and your friends have brought scores of victims to my doorstep . We kill only in self defence , or to protect others . Mm , justified or not , they all arrive the same way dead . Except me . Quite so . But I will have you in the end . In the meantime , you will accept my challenge , or your friends will be struck down where they stand . No , please , you can 't. they 've ... they 've done no wrong . Oh , I can . And I will . What a terrible stain that will be on a pure and noble soul . John ? What , is Roxton back already ? No , apparently not . I must have been dreaming . I hope it was a pleasant one . Not really . He was cooking . I dreamt he burned down the treehouse . Oh , Marguerite , breakfast wasn 't entirely inedible . Now I remember my dear wife 's cooking . That was a disaster . - I don 't believe it ! - Oh yes ! - I thought she was trying to poison me ! - No , look ! Great galloping ghosts ! How can that be ? My balloon ! My wondrous balloon ! - She 's made it back ! - Can you see Veronica ? There 's someone there it must be her ! Come on ! I knew you 'd find a way . Look at it ! It 's almost completely intact ! Where 's Veronica ? Veronica ? There she is ! Veronica ! Are you all right ? I thought this day would never come . I 'm home ! I 'm really home ! Oh indeed you are ! Welcome back ! I thought about you every day . The treehouse just hasn 't been the same without you . I can 't wait to see it . Where are the boys ? - Well , uh . - Roxton 's gone hunting . Let 's hope he brings back something worthy of this occasion . And Malone ? Where is he ? Writing in his journal as usual ? He uh you know ... What is it ? What 's happened to him ? He 's fine . But he 's left us . He 's gone on a journey of sorts . - Alone ? - Well , that 's the way he wanted it . He had some things he needed to work out for himself . But don 't worry , he will be back . Well , when ? He didn 't say , but he did leave a letter before he left . You mean a great deal to him , Veronica . I think he 's going to miss you most of all . I never realized how important he was to me , until he wasn 't there to cheer me up every day . Well , let 's secure the balloon and then we can ... come back and sort it all out when Roxton 's with us . Time devours everything , so said the Roman poet . And one by one your friends will come to me . Perhaps in their own time . But not by my hand . Then by your negligence , If you do not play the game , you will forfeit every one of them . Are they not worth fighting for ? I would lay down my life for each of them . Good ! We 'll start with the scientist . - Challenger ? - Umm a troublesome sort . Always doing and undoing things . He 's saved a few too many lives for my liking . If I 'm here because I have killed so be it . But Challenger has nothing to do with my being here . Didn 't you say you 'd follow him to hell and back ? Isn 't he the reason you went to the South American plateau in the first place ? - Yes . - Then surely ... he 's responsible for you being stranded there . It 's not his fault . What has this man ever done for you to deserve such undying loyalty ? He stands by me through thick and thin ! He listens without judgement , defends and inspires me . And all that I have ever given him , he has given back . Every bond has a breaking point . Eventually he will disappoint or abandon you . Never ! Not , George Challenger . Such passion ! Such resolve ! This too will fade to dust when you are mine . Why do you involve my friends if I 'm the one you want ? Though I walk through the valley of death , I shall fear no evil . Do you like my garden ? It 's pretty much what I 'd expect from you . This crystal represents the soul of your friend . And this labyrinth the many twists and turns ... the blind passageways of life . Find the crystal and bring it back to me before the time expires , and the scientist will live . Fail and he 'll be mine . How far away do you think he got ? Oh , three or four hundred miles maybe ... It 's hard to say . The wind kept changing direction . That must have been frightening , lost and all alone . Oh , not alone . I had my parents journal and a lot of time to read it . Saw no sign of them I gather , No . I kept hoping I would . But their journal renewed my faith that they are alive out there somewhere . Oh we will find them , or they 'll find you . Challenger , look ! Roxton 's rifle ! And that 's not all . Why would he drop his weapons ? Roxton ! Where is he ? Kay-ko head-hunters ! They 've been shot ! Obviously by Roxton , There must have been others of them and they 've taken him away . No . There were only four of them . Well if the head-hunters didn 't take him , what happened to him ? Careful , Lord Roxton . There 's fires everywhere . Didn 't you just run down that path before ? Damn you ! In the name of science , I would try a little harder . Round and round the mulberry bush . You 're running around in circles ! You 're getting nowhere . You go to hell ! Ohh , Losing your temper . That 's not going to help . Gotcha ! Congratulations , that wasn 't too difficult now , was it ? Oh but you 're running out of sand ! Oh , another wrong turn . This wasn 't there before ! Oh yes . Yes , it was . You 're just a little confused . Oh , you made it back , not many people do . Here . Oh ! Unfortunately your time is up . The scientist is mine . Then where is he ? Roxton ! Round one goes to me it seems . - What have you done to him ? - See it yourself . Roxton ! Challenger ! I 'll get you out of that , George ! I promise you ! He can 't hear you . He can only see your situation as you see his . I swear , you 'll pay for this ! There 's no cause for alarm just yet . Your friend isn 't dead he 's merely waiting at my door . - What are you talking about ? - Mmm , the game 's just begun . - Perhaps you 'll win him back . - How ? Tell me how , dammit ! There are others who are dear to you . At least two I can think of . Marguerite ! And the one who swings from tree to tree . Veronica ? - Veronica found her way back ? - Not two hours ago . How excited she was , how happy to be home . How sad for you that you 'll have to lose her all over again . I won 't play this game any longer ! Then you 'll forfeit the scientist . Is that what you want ? Veronica 's life is not mine to bargain with ! Not even to regain your dearest friend ? Why you ? ! Who the hell do you think you are ! You 're not God ! You 're a disease , a wretch plague ! The scourge of all existence ! I am eternal sleep ... the end of suffering . I am peace and tranquility . Is my gentle touch not soothing ? Come , Lord Roxton ! are you not a gambling man ? You 've danced with me so many times and walked away . Shall we not try another ? Challenger ! Challenger ! - Where is he ? - I don 't know . He 's got to be around here somewhere . Challenger ! First Roxton , now Challenger ! What 's going on ? One minute he 's here , the next minute he 's gone . Must be something about this place ... Like what ? I 've walked this path a hundred times , and so have you . Then you tell me what 's going on ! If we think about it logically . Logically ! Since when does logic have anything ... to do with what happens around here ? Well , they left their guns behind , It must mean something . What it means is wherever they are , they have no weapons ! You 're not helping , Marguerite ! Now think . Dammit , Challenger ! You 're the one who 's supposed ... to be able to explain the unexplainable ! Some homecoming this has turned out to be . Veronica . Born in the jungle , where she will die . Shall I take her now ? - No . - Come play with me . Double or nothing . If you win this round , I 'll spare her AND the man of science . What twisted game is going to be this time ? Oh , don 't be angry . Tell me why you value this simple creature so . She took us in when we were lost ... brought us together as family and she is innocent . Family ? What strength is there in that ? Can it put an end to war and strife or hold back the hands of time ? I can cut through its bonds as easily as putty ... pluck a newborn from its parents ... separate man and woman at the moment of their greatest happiness . There is no security in family . Not from death . But security in life . A shoulder to lean on . A safe harbour from the dangers of the world . A place where love grows and happiness abides . Are these things really important to you ? I thought you were a man of action , a lone wolf ! A hunter to do my bidding a man I can depend upon . I am not your servant ... and never will be . Come into my arms enjoy the bliss I can offer . You have nothing I want . Except the lives of your friends . I 'll set the clock for another round . What game would be appropriate for a child of nature hmm . An egg perhaps ? A raptor egg ? Bring one to me here unbroken ... and I will spare the child and release the man of science . Here we go again ! We have to keep looking ! Where , Veronica ? They vanished into thin air ! Are you giving up ? - Would they give up on you ? - Don 't lecture me ! It 's not my fault they disappeared . Is that what you said when I was gone ? That was different . You didn 't just evaporate . You didn 't answer my question , did you even care that I was gone ? Or did you just figure I was dead and rearrange the furniture . Go away ! You know I used to look up to you , admire you . But I really don 't know why when all you care about is you . Where are you ? This is impossible ! Well , where am I going to find a raptor egg around here ! Giving up so easily ? Nothing could live here ! Not so , if you listen carefully , you 'll hear their anguished cries . They 're as displeased as you to be trapped her in my ... glorious domain . Hurry ! Time waits for no man or beast . Veronica , wait ! This isn 't the time for fighting . For all we know Challenger and Roxton could be off ... enjoying themselves somewhere . - Oh , is that what you think ? - No . But we should stick together . Why ? Because you can 't stand to be alone ? No . Because there 's only the two of us now . We don 't know where they are ... or even if they are ever coming back . They WILL ! They 'd better , Or I 'll kill them both . Look I am sorry for what you thought I said back there . And I didn 't rearrange the furniture . Everything is exactly the way you left it . I know . - We WILL find them ! - Yes . And we won 't stop looking until we do . Come on ! It must be around here somewhere . Oh ! yes ! Beautiful . Faster ! Oh ! How unfortunate . We 'll go back to the tree house and start from there . Good idea . Oh , you have got to be kidding ! Get away from us ! - What do you want ? - You . - Veronica ! - NO ! Veronica , not you too ! Roxton , help us ! No ! No ! No please ! You stop this now ! Just let them go ! As you wish . Shall we continue with our sport ? Do I have a choice ? ! Oh , such a petulance ! Most unbecoming in a man like you . Your friends will be released if you win the next round . If not I 'll add one more to my collection . - Not Marguerite ! - Who else ? Hello ? Anybody here ? Please ? Okay . Settle down , stay calm . Show up here and I 'll give you a damn fine welcome . What 's what am I doing ? I can 't fight death . But I will ! With every breath I have ! Maybe it wasn 't death . Just some freak with an oversize hoe ! Oh ! Roxton . Challenger ! Veronica ! Can you hear me ? Talk to me ! Tell me you can hear me ? - What is this ? - A brief respite . Intermission you might call it before we continue with our games . Won 't you join me ? No , thanks . Ooh ! That 's better ! What woman could resist a well-dressed man ... and what man could resist a woman who desires him . You 're not a woman . You 're a demon , masquerading in a woman 's dress ! Oh ! Is that what you think ? Come closer , and I 'll show you how wrong you are . This is as close to Death as I want to be . And even if that day were to arrive , I can only hope I 'd be somewhere else . Good to see your sense of humour has been restored . Come let me feed you grapes and nibble on your ear . Not in this lifetime . Don 't tell me you 're still concerned about Marguerite . She 's the only woman I care about . Oh , poor you , Hopelessly entangled with such cheap London baggage . I 'll carry that baggage any place and any time . If only she were here to listen to such professions of love ! You can leave her right where she is . Well , that all depends on you , must I beg for your touch ? plead for your embrace ? You can grovel at my feet if you think it will do any good . A hard man ! A pillar of cold steel . Um , that 's better . Kiss me ! I 'll never tell . Will you ? What are you looking at ... Lord John Roxton ! Always grinning like a Cheshire cat . And you , Veronica . Some protection you turned out to be . The eternal optimist too innocent for your own damn good ! What 's that ? Don 't start with another one of your grand designs , Challenger . The world is a much bigger place than you think ! Are you getting all this down , Ned ? Another story for all your adoring fans ? I heard that . Don 't think that just because you saved my life once or twice ... that we are anything more than what we are . Roxton , where are you ? Why did you all abandon me ? Pheasant ? I 'm not hungry . Gamy if not carefully prepared . The breast is the most tender , wouldn 't you agree ? You know , you 're wasting your time and mine . Still concerned with your friends ? As long as you hold them in the palm of your hand , they 're all I care about . And if they were to die of natural causes , what would you do then ? I 'd continue on with my life , What choice would I have ? - Oh , I can think of one . - That 's not a choice . That 's the coward 's way out . Even if you lost your beloved Marguerite ? Why , I 'd go on living , just to keep the memory of her alive . Oh , such romance , I can hardly bear it . Spears of asparagus are best when lightly steamed . Would you care to try one ? You know , you take such great delight in pain and suffering , don 't you ? I am the end of pain and suffering . Crisp . Delicious . My personal favourite . Well personally , I think death is overrated . So said a great English poet once . One short sleep past , we wake eternally , and death shall be no more . Death thou shalt die . And where is that poet now ! Dead and buried in the ground ! Poetry and lofty thoughts do not change reality . All who live will come to me willingly or otherwise . Come now , Lord Roxton . You haven 't touched a thing ! Not even me . Will you not at least try one of these fine dishes ? Oh , it 's not the food that ruins the appetite ... it 's the company . What man could turn away from oysters bathed in their on liquor . It is , after all , the food of lovers . Yes which I hasten to add you and I will never be . Oh , but we will ! Even you will feel the kiss of death ... perhaps sooner than you think . Well , when that day comes , I 'm sure ... it will be like ashes in my mouth . Such simple pleasures you deny yourself . Such high standards you set before you . Do you think any of your friends would do the same for you . - I know they would . - You 're wrong ! They would forsake you in a second to save themselves ... especially Marguerite . You are a liar I don 't believe you ! You 're a liar and a cheat and a lousy one at that . Now if I 'm the one you want , you take me now , but let my friends go free ! Oh , it 's you I want , but you have to ... give yourself willingly , without reserve . Never . John ? Still not here . Still alone . Oh , maybe you 're back in London ... walking in Trafalgar Square ... surrounded by all I love . I hope so . I hope all of you are . Well , where are you , Death ? What are you waiting for ? Aren 't I good enough for you ? I 'm not waiting anymore . My life goes on . Catch me if you can . And I will not go gently . This woman you love more than life itself . What can I do to break the bond ? Nothing . Would you trade her life for the lives of your friends ? The scientist and the child of nature ? Umm , difficult choice , isn 't it ? What about the other way around ? Their lives for hers ? What do you want me to say ? What answer are you looking for ? I 'm trying to understand what makes you tick . - And do you ? - I think so . You love life but have no fear of death . You love a woman and you would lay down your life to save her . You believe that men are capable of great things . And you believe that good will triumph over evil . Pretty much sums it up . And if I let you go , you and your friends , you would forge ahead and never look back , you carry on as if nothing had happened . I would certainly try to . And you would have learned nothing ! Nothing that I don 't know already . Then let me make it simple for you . Before the time runs out , show me where the oysters are . Oysters ? What the hell are you talking about ? The game we 've been playing all along . Choose the right dish and you and your friends are free to go . Fail in your powers of observation ... and Marguerite will join the others . Grains of sands slip through the hourglass ... like the breath of a dying man . Choose now or Marguerite is mine . That one . Are you sure that 's not the pheasant ? Last chance to change your mind and choose another . I stick with the one I choose . Oh , I thought you would . Let 's see ... are these the oysters ? Oh , again I win and again you lose . It 's so long since I 've been here . Too long . It 's funny how this place has grown on me . Well , if I must live alone , then I will . And each day will make me stronger . Your time of death has finally come , Marguerite . Oh no it hasn 't , take off your cloak . Are you not afraid of me ? I want to see who or what you really are . I am Death , the gatherer of souls . A collector ! Not a killer ! Why have you taken my friends before their time ? - It was their time . - No it wasn 't ! You jumped the gun ! You cheated them ! No ! HE cheated me . He should have been mine a long time ago . But he was too smart for you . Too cunning . So you just took him anyway . He cannot escape his fate . Then wait a while longer , make do with someone else ! Are you offering yourself to save him ? Could I ? Pick up your gun and prove to me that ... his life his more important than your own . If I do , what guarantee do I have that you will spare him . No guarantee at all , I didn 't come here to make a deal with you . Get away from me ! I 'm ALIVE ! - Marguerite ! - Where are we ? No , please , not Marguerite ! Marguerite ! Don 't ... Don 't let it end like this ! Get up , Lord Roxton . What more do you want from me ? Didn 't you say you 'd carry on without your friends ? If they were to die from natural causes but not like this . One by one you failed them . The man you swore to protect , the innocent child of nature , and the woman you wouldn 't betray for me . You 've taken everything , and left me with nothing ? What happened to your pride and your will to live ? - You took that as well . - Oh . Poor broken man . How easy it was for me to reduce you to this ! Your fine words and noble pretences ... stripped of these you are like any other man . Spirit gone , no fire in your eyes . You are nothing more than clay . You win . All right ? So take me ... but spare my friends please . I beg you . No , not yet . Death is cruel and heartless ... inevitable for every living thing . Yet I feel compelled to offer you another chance ... to win back your friends and save yourself as well . Another game I cannot win ? Oh , but you can ... if your aim is true . Will you accept the challenge ? Yes . - I will . - Good . That 's better . All right , so now what ? what do I do now ? Ask not for whom the bell tolls ... It tolls for thee . Or so said some English poet of whom you are so fond . Welcome to your final test . Come here . Who is this man ? A murderer condemned to death , taken from ... the gallows to serve my purpose . What the hell is your purpose ? A duel . Choose your weapons . This time your game seems far too easy . You don 't trust me ? I have no reason to . They 're identical , one bullet each . Back to back . On my signal , you will walk ten paces , you will turn , and you will fire . Then let 's get on with it . Good luck , Lord Roxton . Even though I desire you above all the others , I would not be disappointed if you won this round . I 'll try not to let you down . One ... - two ... - My dear friends - three , four , five , six , seven ... - Please forgive me should I fail . eight , nine , ten . Roxton , no ! Marguerite ! - Kill her ! - Never ! Kill her or the others will perish ! No ! No ! Kill her or kill yourself . Don 't , Roxton . Silence ! No please ! The game is over , kill yourself or the others will die . You give me your word that you 'll release them . Give me your life and I 'll give you my word . It 's a trick ! She can 't win unless you let her ! Rejoice in the tranquility of death ! No ! Don 't ! What are you waiting for ? End their ... suffering as well as your own ! Damn you ! I despise you with every dying breath ! I 'll embrace you on the other side . Do it . Now . Pull the trigger . Yes ! - No . - Yes ! - No ! - YES ! I 'll live out my days in agony and despair , but I will forever deny you this final victory ! Oh , your days are over . Your time has come . Time has no meaning to me anymore ! No ! No ! What have you done ! What have you done . Know this , John Roxton , your day will come , and I WILL claim you . What happened ? - Roxton ? - Marguerite ! Are you really here ? Yes and so are you ! Challenger , I thought I 'd lost you ! Oh , no chance of that ! Veronica ? Thank heavens you made it back ! Life was just too boring without you . - Can we go home now ? - Yeah ! Let 's do it . Death was a beautiful woman . In fact , or in your mind ? That 's a good question . She looked real enough . We all saw her . Yes . But the force that produced it ... surely was merely an illusion intended to seduce you . - No chance of that . - None ? One beautiful woman is more than enough for me . Well you must have been tempted just a little . - It was quite a dance . - Oh , yes , I 'm sure it was . Which brings up a very good question . If you had a choice , what would you do on your last day ? Well , I 'd spend it here with all of you . - And with my parents , of course . - And Malone , too . - We can 't forget Malone . - He 's probably back in London by now . Oh , I doubt it , he wouldn 't leave without Veronica . - Do you really think so ? - Oh , I 'm certain of it . In fact , I 'm sure he 's thinking about you this minute . - Well , Roxton , it looks delicious . - Thank you . All this talk about death has made me very hungry , indeed . what was her cooking like , by the way ? Oh , she taught me a recipe or two , but ... nothing compared to yours . Two , four , six , eight ! Try the grapes . I plucked them myself . *

 Previously on Farscape . We all knew the time would come when we 'd split up . I 'm coming with you . - No , I 'm sorry . Aeryn is with child . Commander , stay clear . We 're being drawn in ... Captain ... you ... I suggest you aim that behind you . The creatures following me execute on sight . - Chiana . - Hey . Nice to see ya . And you haven 't seen Moya ? If an officer superior to you ordered it , I would similarly execute you without hesitation . So says every one of your psychological evaluations , Captain Braca . Grayza is a manipulator . I understand you no longer have a ship to command . We would like to repay our debt . You don 't owe us anything . Nevertheless , if we are able , you shall arrive at the planet where you think your friends may be . And now on Farscape . That do it ? Elack senses a planet , but the erratic weather patterns are interfering . Oh , frell ! Sparky , can you fix scan ? I 'm trying . Come here and hold this . Hold ' em yourself . Crichton , why are we searching for this planet ? Arnessk is uninhabitable . No . Jool told us every few cycles the magnetics drop low enough for the dig team to remain there for awhile . Help me ! My hand is still too weak . Yeah , right . Pull the other one and I 'll whistle " Felinnoosen " . No life-forms are registering on Elack 's senses , but I ... but I 'm so weak , I ... I ... can 't be sure . Shh . Rest . You rest , sweetheart . We 're gonna go check it out . Hey , Crichton , don 't go down without me . I don 't wanna be here when Psycho zaps the final zalk . I don 't see anyone . You see anyone ? No . What 's the matter ? I just got a feeling . Well , is that a " feeling " feeling or ... Just a feeling . Okay . Okay , now I 'm getting a feeling . You 're not getting a feeling ? No , no feelings . Hang on . Take this . Take this . My chakan oil 's low . Right . Then again , I might have had a feeling . Get back . Peacekeeper , drop your weapon . That 's a common mistake . I 'm not a Peacekeeper . Drop your weapon or the female dies . He 's not a Peacekeeper . Wait ! Tarnat , stop . Ha ha ! John ! D 'Argo ! Oh , you 're breaking my back ! Let go ! We didn 't know it was you , so we hid . But it 's you ! Look at you ! Yeah , it 's really me , Princess . John ! - D 'Argo ! Chiana ! Who is this Peacekeeper ? - How bout them Bears ... Why is he with the tralk ? He 's not a Peacekeeper . - She 's not a tralk . Forgive Tarnat . He 's new security here and he 's just a little gung-ho about protecting the dig . You 've been warned . There are races who would kill for what we 've discovered . Tarnat ! These are my friends . So , are Aeryn and Rygel with you ? Rygel , yeah . Aeryn we haven 't heard from . Has she contacted you ? No , not yet . But , uh , you know , she will . Right . Is Moya here ? We didn 't detect her when we came aboard . No . ... and then we 're gonna look for Aeryn . You know what ? You 've got to come and meet ... I don 't think the instructor would want that . Tarnat , just put it back in your pants and calm down . Cheer up , John . I have a lot to tell you about my travels . Can you believe it , we 're here . We 're here and we 're alive and nobody is trying to kill us . Come on . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Check this out . This is the most important planet in the universe ! Jool , Moya got spat out like a fur ball . How the hell did that happen ? - Stop . That 's all I remember . Please , D 'Argo 's gone to find the weird old lady and she 'll explain what happened . She spoke to Pilot for arns , okay ? These sensors are for the magnetics . When it 's blue , the levels are safe . Red is bad . Red means don 't pack , fly . But this ... this is what I was talking about . This is the greatest archeological discovery of the last one thousand cycles . This ? Yeah . I mean , it may not look like much to the untrained eye ... My eye 's okay , Princess . Hey , is that valuable ? I 'm not sure but I 'll run some tests and check ... Ah ! Nice arm . What are you doing ? As fantastic as this is , I 'll take the tour later . What is her problem ? What did I do ? Nothing . You did nothing . She just had a rough time away from Moya . Jool , if it 's all right , I 'm gonna find Grandma . No , no , no ! Stay here . D 'Argo 's getting her . Please , just wait here and let me show you all this , please . Please ! D 'Argo ? Wrinkles ? Frell . It 's remarkable , isn 't it ? You scared me . I don 't know . I thought you were gonna go find Wrinkles . I was . I couldn 't find her down by the cliffs so I thought she might have come here . It 's ... It 's good to see you again , Chi . 12,000 cycles ago , Arnesskan priests worshipped . Mystics . Somehow they maintained a truce with the Scarrans and the Peacekeepers for 500 generations . Imagine . Imagine if we could discover their secret for peace . No one knows how they achieved it because ... one day , they just vanished . And it 's like everyone just left in a microt . And no one knows why . I know why . This is Instructor Vella . You 're John Crichton . Yes . Tarnat said I 'd find you here . I see why he mistook you for Sebacean . Same size , weight , coloring . Though the brain cavity appears smaller . Yeah , but my choppers are first class and I do an excellent turn my head and cough . - What ? I see you 're not interested in any of this . I just have some unfinished business to attend to . This is more fascinating than any business you might have . Believe it or not , this planet was once a paradise . Virgin water , panoply of life-forms . But three of these probes , which form the Darnaz Triangle , were launched by enemies of peace . They created magnetic summers that killed the priests and drove civilization away . You understanding any of this ? Well , I missed a couple of the big words , so maybe I should just ... Instructor Vella has found two of the probes . Legend has it if I find the third probe , I can reverse its damage , and so reactivate the Darnaz Triangle . Jool started to drive you crazy yet ? She ... she just keeps going on and on about this place . Well , it , uh , can be like an obsession . We 've been working from dawn till dusk . You and the princess ? Mm-hmm . You and the princess ? Did the Peacekeepers capture you and ... and ... steal your brain and replace it with whatever you 're using now ? What 's the matter ? They 're always this far away from getting me . How come they they didn 't get you ? Lo 'La hid me . Lola ? Lo 'La . Your ship can disappear . For a short time . And you named her Lo 'La ? It 's short for Lo 'Laan . In memory of my wife . Ryg , D 'Argo and Jool are here and D 'Argo 's got his ship back . They expect that Moya 's gonna be back sometime soon . Well , she 'd better hurry . I can barely hear you and the heat 's nakked in here . Crichton , this Leviathan is dying . We 've got to get off it soon . Crichton ? Were you still talking ? Sorry . Connect me back to Crichton . Cannot do it . External comms are dead . This ship is entering termination shutdown . In case we need it in a few arns , I want to get this module started . Pilot and Moya . Crichton and the others are here on Arnessk . Their presence is a source of irritation . Retrieve them now or we 'll have to take our own steps . We intercepted this transmission to Moya 60 microts ago . You were right . They did follow the Interion to the planet . How long will it take for our Command Carrier to get there ? Ten arns . Make it five . Captain . But first ... come and see this . I find your amateur attempts at ... torture ... to be quite pleasurable . I could resist it for cycles . Maybe you can ... or maybe you can 't . But this rod will make it a little more difficult . Don 't do this , Braca . I made you . No . I made you . I think now you will finally tell me all you know about John Crichton . I told you everything about John Crichton ! No , Scorpius . You hold onto secrets because you fear that when you finally do tell me everything , you will die . And you 're probably right . Grandma ? I studied his response as I told him of the Darnaz Triangle . He has no interest in it . No , don 't worry . It 'll be over soon . Our last vector test will reveal the third probe . Oh , damn ! Grandma ! Damn ! The creature from the Black Lagoon , sorta . Grandma , how you doing ? You remember me ? Me , Crichton , you , Grandma . Get away , Oo-nii . Go on , scat . Go on . Go on , scat . Go on . I remember . You 're hoo-man . Right . Crichton ! Oh ! Ah ! Damn ! You need a bath . Never bathe . Never bathe . No , no . Washes off the juice . That 's more than I wanna know . Listen , Jool said that you guys got spat out of a wormhole . She said that only you knew what happened . Ask Pilot . Pilot knows . I talked to Pilot . Pilot knows what ? - No , no , ask him . I must follow Vella . Hey , I need to know about ... How old are you ? How old ? I am 293 cycles . Anytime there is goodness , it will be destroyed . By ... by a cause , or weapon . Oh , yes , yes , this is Holy Land . Yes . Oh , no , I won 't let Vella have any of it . It 's the voices , the voices . They scream to me . The Darnaz Triangle must never be used again . I don 't hear your voices . - Back off ! Get back . Go on . Get back . I 'm not interested in your voices . You know what I 'm interested in . Aeryn 's child . You pierced my subliminal message . Yeah . And I might have stopped her if I 'd known sooner . Why would you want to stop her ? She 's carrying my child . Well , my DNA . Oh , I didn 't keep that secret from you . She did . And I just wanted you to accept Aeryn 's decision . But now , I can help you forget . Laka . It 's all over this planet . Squeeze the juice meat out of it and stick it up your nose . You 'll get a jolt . Wham ! And for 500 microts , nothing bothers you . No think of Aeryn . Nothing . Get that thing away from me . - Okay , away , away . Ask Vella if all the priests died here , why are there no bones ? Why are there no bones ? Okay . Do you feel that ? Just let the tug of energy tell you how fast you need to work . Well , I guess now that Crichton 's back , you 'll head off with him again soon . Yeah . I mean , um , perhaps . I 've ... Being here , I 've really enjoyed it . Yeah ? Yeah . You know , I think we 've really found something here . We should clean it up and show Vella . And stick it up her nose . It 's a prayer wheel . Found on every wall in the site . And it would never fit up my nose . Yeah , well , I didn 't actually mean that ... Now , why are you using that ? Well , for this ... In unskilled hands , a Carver can be perilous . You see , Luxan , the process that strips away cycles of age , when it hits living flesh , absorbs the molecular signature of whatever it touches . Thus , that Laka ... is now rock . Magnetic pulses surrounding the planet make it impossible for the Command Carrier to land . But Marauders with less sophisticated electronics can make it through . How much longer will the dig site remain habitable ? 40 to 50 arns . Closer . Well , that 's Chief Scientist Taylik 's best estimation , ma 'am . No . You . Closer . Down . On your knees . Are there any other vessels near the planet ? Just a dead Leviathan in decayed orbit . I 'm prepping a squadron now . Closer . Closer . Braca , does it bother you what has happened to Scorpius ? No . We won 't need a squadron . We 'll go to the planet together . You and me , three Marauders , 20 soldiers . Wh-why ? I always assumed John Crichton was just an outlaw . An excuse for Scorpius 's mistakes . But he destroyed a Command Carrier . The Scarrans desire him . Perhaps , somehow , I can use him . Perhaps Scorpius 's enemy will be my friend . Grave robbers leave snares . This has been opened . Here . Make certain you turn your face away and open it . Just a primitive Jarnass flash . Only if it hits your eyes will it cause damage . You 're brave and listen well . Do you plan to keep studying when we leave the dig ? If I 'm allowed , yes . And the Luxan ? He is ... he 's my friend . But not your equal ! Intellectually , Luxan 's are a subspecies . He will make mistakes . You will be blamed for them . I know . Crichton , he 's arrested me . Hands up . Oh yo , yo , hey . No need for ... no need for guns . The old lady told me how you planned to stop us . I didn 't plan to do anything ... Ah ! He 's one of the defilers . They lie . They will not use the probes for good . Kill him ! No . Vella may not fear you . But I know you 're their leader . I 've heard about you . Get him , Crichton . I helped you . I showed you Aeryn . You didn 't show me squat ! Sit , just sit ! Listen to me ... I don 't even know this old lady 's name . She came on board our ship like a really bad smell that won 't go away . I 'm not a threat to you . I just want Moya to come back so I can get the hell out of here . That 's it . Except one thing . Do not point guns at people ! That 's right . Hit him again . No ! Oh , go on , Crichton . Let me show you . Like this . And ... See ? What the hell are you doing ? Why are you telling me to shoot people ? - ' Cause you have to . Vella will take the Darnaz probes and use them as a weapon . - No I don 't . Why do you think she sent the rest of the dig team away ? I have no idea . There was peace here once . You must see what was lost here . - Granny ... I can 't let this happen anywhere else . Oh ! Damn ! See . See the ancient world . See . See what I see . The children 's tiles . The peaceful thread within us all . It started here . See . See the Darnaz probes . See it all . I saw priests ... and a goat ... probes falling from the sky . I saw where they landed . Like a wormhole back to the past . See . See the peace . Now sleep . Sleep , Crichton . Crichton , wait , wait ! I just had to wake you ! Wait , wait ! Crichton , stop ! I 'm not going to hurt you ! You scared the hell out of me ! I thought you were a sea monster , a creature , critter or something . What 's with this weather ? I must have been out for a long time . Not long . You must stop old woman . Oh , just lemme ... clear the antifreeze out of my head . Vella , she has found the third probe . It 's still under the ground . Your old lady , she swears she will kill Vella so she cannot use it as a weapon . No , no , she 's just nuts . She 's not gonna do anything . She ... She take your gun ? Granny ! Oh , who 's there ? It 's all right . There 's no one here . No one at all . Hey . Hey , what are you doing ? Why didn 't you stand up for me ? D 'Argo ... most Interions think Luxans are inferior . That 's just the way it is . What do you think ? Don 't ask me that . What do you think ? I think ... that you 're unusual for a Luxan . Yeah . Yeah , I am that . Sikozu . Have you finished with that module ? Sikozu ! Oh ... Shh ... shh ... D 'Argo , you can 't blame Vella if she thinks she 's smarter than you . No , but I can blame you . I never believed that any of you cared what I thought . I care . And just so you know , if someone had criticized you , or insulted you , called you a stuck-up , arrogant little princess , I 'd have defended you . Granny ! Granny ! Granny , I just want Winona so I can get the hell out of here . Receive the spirit . Granny ! Granny . Must stop Vella . Not let her destroy another world . The Carver . Have to protect . The voices . The voices say ... don 't let them use it . Don 't let them . Who 's there ? Show yourself . And what are you doing here ? Is this some sort of joke ? No ! Grandma ? Oh , boy . Damn . - Shh . Shh . What ... what happened here ? - Quiet . I turned my back for , like , five minutes , and ... What 's is Laura Croft doin ' in the wall ? - Quiet . Quiet ! Instructor Vella , are you all right ? We saw ... What are you doing ... Now , don 't say a word . Not a word . Receive the spirit of Instructor Vella , no matter how selfish , how evil . D 'Argo , you knocked him out . She 's , like , " in " the wall . What happened to the rest of her ? She told me that if the Carver hits living flesh it alters the DNA . Nobody cares about the DNA . Why did you knock that guy out ? If he had seen me with her , he would have attacked and then he 'd be dead . I saved his life . Receive her spirit . We 're still missing one person . Wrinkles ? - Yeah . You think she did this ? She can 't even take a bath . She 's been acting weird . If you 're planning to escape in that , I 'm going with you . Does all your species have truncated spines ? Don 't play arky-arky with me . I promise I 'm smarter than you 'll ever be . Then you should realize even with the combustion liquid I 've synthesized , this module would not travel for more than an arn . So ... no . I am not trying to escape in it . What 's that ? It 's Peacekeeper code . Three Marauders are heading to the planet . That receiver has never picked up coded transmissions . I know . I modified it . Oh . Go to Pilot 's den . Get that hangar door open . Then hide in the Neural Cluster . That will shield your life signature should the Peacekeepers scan . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to warn the others so they can hide . You 're lying . I told you I would not last more than an arn in this . Now , get those doors open . Move ! Then send a secure comm to Moya . Stop her from coming until the Peacekeepers have gone . You smell Granny ? No . She 's not here . Weird . What ? I 've ... I 've been here . Déjà vu . This ... There . How 's this thing work ? It 's point and click , right ? Keep it away from me . Hey , it 's not a problem . Under here there 's something that has , I think , symbols on it . Most of them alien , one ... maybe I recognize . Maybe . How did you know that was here ? Holy crap , it 's real . What is it ? A child 's tile . You know any of these ? This one 's Interion . That one might be early Sebacean . Never seen the others . What do they mean ? The symbol is peace , security . Peace . You recognize any of the symbols ? One ... maybe . Egyptian . From my homeworld . Come on , got a change of plan . Let 's go . Chiana , can you hear me ? Chiana , I 'm prepping for a flyover to see if I can find the old lady . Can you hear me ? Chiana , I 'm getting some sort of proximity alarm . Can you hear me ? Chiana ? ! Do you know what this means ? It means there 's a link between my world and this one . Somehow they 're connected . Pip ... Peacekeepers . Peacekeepers . Chiana , if you can hear me , I think the ship 's ... The Peacekeepers already have them . Stop the comms . We must come up with a plan . Remember me ? Oh , yeah . I remember a couple of things . Tell her to shove it up tork , Crichton . I can make things easy for you . And to prove my goodwill , Braca ? He 'll never bother you again . Scorpius ? Scorpius ... Do anything you want to him , anything at all . No , thanks . I don 't think I can come up with anything better than that . What do you want from me ? What I want ... may not be as bad as you think . You might even like it . What are you doing ? Crichton , are you ... what are you doing ? Wait an arn ... then we 'll meet . Secure the site . Wake up ! I 'm awake . What 's the matter ? Peacekeepers . We have to get a secure comm to Moya . Elack 's transmission core is corrupted . Everything 's dying . I can 't do anything . Oh . No , no , Pilot . Stay with me ! Enar ... tarnar ... Pilot ! Pilot ! I ... I 'm finished , Dominar . I 'm sorry . Please forgive me . - Please ... Pilot . The orbiting Leviathan is empty . At present , we 've captured the Interion , a Nebari and an old Traskan . What about the Luxan and the Peacekeeper traitor ? Uh ... nothing . And this ? The magnetics have spiked . According to this , we 've got approximately 20 arns left and under these circumstances , I think we should leave . He 's regaining motor stimulus . Change him . No . No , Braca . This is for all the times I 've had to say yes . Good , they 're still here . The two probes are safe . He found a tile ? Yeah . Th-that he saw or something with that powder that you whacked him with . A real tile ? Yeah , that 's what he said . From the vision . Oh , no . What ? What 's the matter ? Chi . Yeah . When we first met , did you know I was on the run ? Accused of stealing from a Noatian gem mine . Okay . We 've all gotta cheer up , okay ? Because you are driving me nuts . I stole things from digs , but things that I needed . To study , to learn more , you understand ? I don 't have a problem with that , Jool . But I never stole from here . There is this legend , of this glorious temple . Here . That touched the sky . And no one 's ever found a trace of it . And I dreamed of discovering it , and ... now we 'll never discover any of it . - Thanks for sharing . No . The priests will help us . You 'll see . You 'll see . I 'll get Crichton . Crichton is nally-whipped . Give me a distraction and I 'll save us all . All right . Okay , Wrinkles . Follow my lead . Hey . Minia . Hey , uh ... The old lady . She 's , uh ... She 's got a problem . Down below . What do you mean ? She needs to go to the noli . Okay . Go . Do you like that ? It 's better than what Scorpius used to do . Peace can only be maintained if there is sacrifice . Peace ... Sacrifice . Do you like that ? Peace ... Sacrifice ... Whatever you want . Whatever ... You can have it . Peace can only be maintained if there is sacrifice . Never been real before . What are you doing here , old woman ? In the vision I enhanced , you saw a tile . A child 's tile . Yeah , just like the one I found . What did you do to me ? Must be the magnetics . Pushes the vision further . Somehow the suggested turned real . Does Grayza know you saw the Darnaz probes ? No . Good . I have seen the carnage weapons of mass destruction bring . For Vella to have had one was awful to consider , but the Peacekeepers ... They must never have it , Crichton . Do you know where the final probe landed ? Yeah . This is my fault . I wanted only to show you the peace they had achieved . Somehow I showed you , what you must not know . No ! The vision I showed you ... became real . Grayza can never know where the final probe is . You cannot tell her . You must die . Oh , forgive me . Forgive me . No other way . Forgive me . Walk to the cliff . To the cliff . Go now . Forgive me . Receive his spirit . Forgive me . Receive the spirit of John Crichton . He has to die . Oh , forgive me . He has to die . Has to . He had to die . He 'll never tell you now . Never .

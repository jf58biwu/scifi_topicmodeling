Worse than that . Where ? In the administration of the president . And what do you do there ? Well , what do you do in any administration ? Administrate . Is it inside the Kremlin ? Our department is on Lubynaka . In the FSB building . Cool . And what I meant , what is your job there ? Security ? The president 's administration isn 't responsible for security . The department I work in is responsible for delivering mineral water to the Kremlin . Okay . It 's time for a grappa . Hey chief ! I hope you 're not out of grappa , are you ? I have grappa . And I 'll take another beer . So what kind of water goes to the Kremlin ? It varies . From Evian to Borgomi . What kind does the president drink ?

Of course . Not Russian . She really drinks a lot ? About A couple of bottles a day . That 's not really a lot ? A couple of bottles of champagne ! Now vodka would be a different story . A Russian woman should easily be able to drink a liter of vodka . Right ! My friend can drink one alone . And afterwards go walk the catwalk . She is a model ? Yup . Do you also walk the catwalk ? No . I 'm in a different business . Hm , interesting , what kind ? Advertising . And what do you advertise ? Different stuff . Well right now there 's this Japanese device . Home appliance ? No it 's this device Can I have another cigarette please This new generation device for improving one 's health while one working . Something like an air ionizer ? Almost . But a totally new generation . You hook it up to the socket in the office and in a few minutes it generates this field , these waves , and it works very nicely right away . People don 't get tired , are always on the go , there 's no more irritation , and our usual disgust goes away . I truthfully didn 't believe it at first - like , you know , work is work : yesterday I advertised air conditioners , today this device . And then I took one to try for myself at home . How was it ? Well ... Really a different thing ! I usually have troubles waking up in the morning .. I have to work so hard all day long , go , sign , speak ... And here - such pleasant mood ! Japanese all the same are able to do things . What 's it called ? In Japanese it 's called " Chao van . " " Chao van ? " Yes . That 's the name of a Japanese bird . You know , one they worship . A crane or something ? No , it 's a different bird there 's a picture of it on the device - it 's bluish with a reddish tail . It lives up in their forests , or mountains . Only in Japan . And sings only after midnight . Like an owl ? No . And when it sings , all Japanese start to feel much better . Fall asleep ? No , like just in general . They even cry . From joy . While sleeping ? " Chao van . " Never heard of it . Have you sold a lot of these devices ? Um , close to one and a half thousand . Maybe you could offer us one ? I 'd be pleased to . Just leave your phone number .

Let me leave you my telephone number . Call from nine to five . Marina Borisovna . When I 'm not away , I 'm always in my office . Or , well , leave a message with the secretary . Thanks . You want another drink ? Yup . Only something else . Champagne ? Ok . Chief , hey chief , wake up . I 'm not sleeping . So cheers ! Marina Borisovna . Cheers what 's your ? Oleg Nikolayevich And you , young man ? Just Vladimir . Well than Oleg Nikolayevich and just Vladimir , let us tank up ! Or rather - tune up . Not like in the army , though . No , musically . You a musician ? Do I look like one ? Yup . Nope . Way off . An organic chemist . Uuu , scary ! I school I just hated chemistry ! Formulas Everyman to his own . And you , well , are in a chemical institute or industry ? I work in a top secret department . In a " mail box " as they used to say . For the war ? Nooo , not for the war . Why 's it closed up than , this box ? It 's hard to explain Inventions , or something ? There 's nothing left to invent in this business . In organic chemistry ? No . In genetic engineering . O , you 're a genetic engineer ? A stylish profession . THE profession . So what do you do there ? Breed sheep ? That too . What else ? Cows ? Cattle ? Aha , yeah , that too . Nooo , come on ? People too ? Of course . What do you mean ? That 's banned . There was some international conference not long ago . And they banned cloning human beings . You 're forgetting what country we are living in . What is banned there is allowed here . And did it work out with a human ? Yes . Long ago . What ? How long ? What did has some boy-clone already been grown ? Not a boy anymore . Or even a teen . What - a guy ? I mean an adult ? Yeah . Sure enough . The oldest is now forty four years old . Hey , come on , man , that 's bullshit ! Forty four ! When was he cloned then ? Back in Khrushyov 's time ? The first human cloning experiments began in 1947 . Professors Bronstein , Lukin . Doctor Nesmeyanov . The first success . The first Stalin award in genetics . Stalin 's time ? Why , genetics was being outlawed back then . Outlawed officially . While unofficially people went on with their work . There were two secret government projects : the atomic bomb and cloning . Only cloning - that 's a western word . But then , and , well , in general we , here call it doubling . The objects are doubles . We don 't use the word " clone " in our institute . But where is this institute ? Or is that a secret ? There are no secrets nowadays . Ever been on Volgina street ? Where 's that ? Somewhere near Belyayevo , right ? I drove by there once . Shemyakin 's institute of organic chemistry is down there . And inside it there is the laboratory where I work . And what , they grow there , these .. .. people doubles ? No , we just have a laboratory there . Where we lay the genes . The objects grow in incubators . Yeah ? So where are these incubators ? There are quite a few . How many ? I can 't say for sure , but when I started at this laboratory six years ago there were about forty . Forty ? Yes . Twelve incubators in Moscow . Four near our lab down in south-west Moscow . And about another eight in the suburbs . But umm I don 't understand anything ! What , do people , like grow in them ? No , no . We only have a laboratory , we are just merging geneticaly . The people grow up in society . Kindergarten , orphanages . That can 't fucking be ! Like , where the hell do these clones go ? Like they go to the army or something ? The same as those that are born the usual way . Different places . There are a few special programs . Which are overseen by special departments . Which departments ? FSB , the defense ministry . So like , how many clones are there already ? In our laboratory ? No , I mean in general ? How many 've been done ? It 's hard to say . You see my professor - he 's been in this project since 1968 . He says that then throughout the Union there were about six thousand healthy doubles and about nineteen thousand sick ones . But today Jesus , I couldn 't even tell you . So like you 're trying to say that come on that 's total shit ! That the doubles are among us ? Why doesn 't anybody know about it then ? Nobody talks about it ? In the president 's administration nobody 's ever said anything ! Not once ! There have been publications . A number of them . I 'm sure that there have been many discussions in your administration . Just you didn 't pay any attention to them . I would have paid plenty attention to something like that . That 's just it , you didn 't . There was a big article about six months ago in MK called the Village of Twins . It described a village somewhere in Mordovia that 's full of sick twins . Twins , Triplets , Quadruplets . and all of them are sick And they all have some kind of internal disease . So what ? Twins - are a normal thing . Yeah , and , like diseases are everywhere One of the first soviet incubators - Soyuz 4 , is located about four kilometers from this village . These twins ... are simply production waste . The first soviet doubles . Volodya ! Sure , it 's past midnight , the perfect time for scary stories and everything . How about I tell you how I once saw a UFO . Near Smolensk , after the army draft . We were going to take a leak , excuse me , wanted to pee hanging above the forest . Bluish-green ! I swear we saw it . three of us saw it And the guys at the post said they did too ! And I once saw a ghost . In St. Pete . I got so scared . Yes , sure , I wouldn 't want to push this at all , if this is daunting . Just Marina asked me where I work and I answered truthfully . Forget it . Could you get me something a little stronger ? Right ! Before midnight lower the degree before sunrise - raise it . How do you know ? A lot of boozing in your line of work ? You know , we like to relax . Work is like a tornado , you have to dodge it right and left . But then - there 's enough for some firewater . The whole firm relaxed together ? Yup . Don 't you ? Or is it prohibited there ? No , not really , nobody bans it , Just not in groups . It 's not really our way . Everyone there has his own friends . Just two or three of us go to our favorite places . Like where ? Kempinsky , John 's , sometimes - Pushkin . Hey , Volodya , what about you guys ? I can 't really recall any pubs around Belyayevo . Or you just knock back a few in your lab ? Rectified . With the clones . Yeah . I 've had a few drinks with them . But not in the lab . In the slums . Where ? In the Krasnoyarsk slum . It 's this place , where well , it 's kinda hard to explain . Like a transit prison . Yeah , but let 's go on to something else . That 's enough . Forget it . Hey chief , another shot of moskovskaya and the verdict . I 'll also take one of those . and afterwards I go home . Volodya , please tell us . Yeah , do what the girl asks . Ohh , you won 't believe this , but it 's really not interesting to be clown . Come on , so tell us about that transit . Let 's put this down first . To accordance . What ? You know , so everyone lives according to his designated place on earth . That 's a good toast . So you see , there are three types of doubles : M - type , F-type and type-4 , or simply fours . The first M-type doubling was conducted by the Germans in 1937 , M-type cloning and stolen by the NKVD . Then professor Bronstein modernized it by adding the domino principle which allowed the paired chromosome to connect to the unpaired one while being substituted . That was able to raise one double F - type doubling . And then in sixty eight , the now deceased Viktor Petrovich Golosov discovered type-4 doubling . That 's when four chromosome-complexes are stuffed into one cell . And consequently four doubles develop simultaneously . You know , quadruplets . And the most amazing thing is that it was number four that produced the least errors and the optimal survival rate . They tried doubling by three , by five , seven , eight , they even made double-12 . But 4 - turned out to be the ideal number . And the most amazing thing is that this number was never sacred in any culture history . Not 3 or 5 or 7 or 12 . 4 ! This is the number that the world rests on . Not 3 . But 4 ! And this really is the heart of the matter of four corners . Yeah like four table legs . And around three years ago ... I was sent on a trip to the famous Krasnodar slum . It 's a cool place . The things that happen there ! It was built by Beria This was the first incubator in the USSR So I did what I had to do . And , because I was off that night , I went to some guy from the department of Initial Correction He asked what I was going to do this night nearest city 35km away , and he says let 's go have a drink with the quartets . Why not , I say . So we took a couple of liters of vodka , some canned food , and went there . But you see the territory , I don 't know , must be like half of Moscow . So we come to this large building where only fours live . So we come to this large building where only fours live . Fours , you mean - quadruplets ? and all twins ? Yeah , fours . And there 's about three hundred of them there . Shabby walls , bricks sticking out of walls . And they are wearing tatter clothing , dirty So he took me right away to area 32 , filled with sixteen-year-old girls . And all of them times four , I mean in fours . So we come to these girls , and they staring at us we started to pour vodka in glasses all come by four , we drink , and suddenly , the first one that also had the biggest boobs there were also four of her , grabbed me by my cloth , tears them apart and falls on me suddenly security comes and says : what are you doing up here ? , are you fucked up ? do you realize it ? So , we ware kicked out of there I almost got fired it 's not even close to the ufo , that a story . that 's it , There was another case not in the Krasnoyask slum , it was in Pushkensk , it ... I arrived there with one guy , to be honest , we didn 't come to drink there but to work we went to one of the buildings , where only niggers lived and all by 4 , all of them were man and if you 're working in the Institute for 5 years you have to do this test : you are put alone into this nigger 's house and all the twins and niggers , eventually they must fuck you . That 's all , shut the fuck up ! How much ? take it all Jesus , what assholes work in the president 's administration . What , did you have a fight ? It 's just late . Everyone wants to sleep . Except me . 220 and 150 Aha 200 ... Ouch my leg fell asleep again . Do you want to come along with me ? Where ? We 'll have a good time there . How 's that ? Like this . Tomorrow would be better . Let 's go now . Come on . Tomorrow , I can 't now . I can 't tomorrow . Hey , at least , like , finish telling what you were saying . Volodya About what ? The end of the story . About those fours . What 'd you do there with them ? I was joking . You made it up ? Yes . Everything ? Everything . From beginning to end . I 'm a piano tuner . Fuck ! Did you hear that ? What ? All that boloney . Siberia or something ? He 's a hunter ? You too . Go on . Sleep . Talented people , dammit . Professor Bronstein ! Uuu , a-a-a-a ! Just bring me some mineral water and one of your main courses . we have a large selection of main courses . Then , how about your specialty . Our specialty dish is young round piglet with apple radish . it 's superb . What kind of piglet ? Round . Ground up or something ? No , that 's the breed . What breed ? Well round piglet . What are they , overfed ? They 're perfectly round . What do you mean round ? A piggy can 't be round . What do you do ? Do you pump them up with air or something ? No , no . They 're born that way . Where ? State breeding farm Kommunarka . They 've been supplying us with round piglet for the last two years . Hey , buddy , listen , I 've been selling meat for seven years and have never heard of round piglet . Well , go to the kitchen and take a look . Sasha , this gentleman here wants to look at the piglet . This is the musicians room . I 'm a musician . The musicians have already left . Obviously , not everyone . You 're the drummer ? Once I was a pianist . And I once was a person . Who are you now ? Only God knows sometimes I wake up in the morning , look at myself in the mirror and think : Who is this ? What is this ? What , you don 't like what you see ? That 's not the point - if I like it or not . People can have strange tastes The point is that - there 's no name . Who has no name ? The reflection ? The person . This here is a turtle . And this is glass . And this is a floor . And they will always , forever be a turtle , glass and a floor . Nothing else . They 've already been made . Finished . But we - not yet . And we could easily become anything or anyone else . That 's why a person doesn 't yet have a name . I have one , I 'm Volodya . So what ? In a measly half an hour you could become a stray dog . Or a rag , that a nice girl uses to wipe her feet on . Or just a piece of live meat . Not true . There 's always a choice . You can decide not to turn into a dog . Or a rag . There 's always a little window . that you can jump out of . Suicide ? Yes . But that 's a palliative . A what ? You know , a forced move . So What ? In this game , forced moves are not acceptable . Hello . Senior-sergeant Khramtsov here , 56th department . Could you show us your passport please ? Damn when will winter end ? When spring starts . You 'll have to come along with us . What 's the problem ? what the matter ? sit Hey , Sule and Marinka : go to Leninsky 65 , entrance 4 , apartment 72 . His name 's Valera .

I 'm late late so stupid What happened ? Why ? Was she killed ? Someone kill her ? No . She died . From what ? Choked . How ? On chewies . What do you mean ? Chewies ? Chewed bread crumbs . And what do I have to do with chewies ? The whole village is making ' dolls here . I know . Doll faces are made out of bread chewies . Old women chewed it and Zoya shaped them together . Then painted them . Making the faces . But , then that day , she came to the crones to have a drink . So they are sitting there , chewing crumbs for the faces . And she says : " Hey , how about I give you a hand with the chewing ? " So she began to chew and choke . Fucking shit Zoya made dolls for us and it 's your fault she has been killed right and you are a good person She herself wanted to chew .. no body asked her to . Look what he is doing ! don 't touch ! You killed her and now you 're gonna drink ! otherwise it couldn 't be . So let 's drink . if we are already here of course eat something otherwise you 'll only be drinking Me ? Oi-vai There were 4 sisters and now 3 You are the fourth .

A mould of the face It 's easy - make one mould and just use it again . Like forms for a tulskiyi gingerbread . Gingerbread ? But that 's the trick .. They looked similar , but she made each of them look special . Each has its own personality . She loved them like a mother loves her children .

The scandal will start again scandal listen .. You know what ? Find a kid and make a mould of his face . Just use it for the shape . always Zoyinka didn 't do it this way . What mould ? How do I make a mould , that I will always be shaping ? how .. ? A mask of the face . Like in the morgue . They smear oil on the face , and put white clay on it . It dries and the mask is ready .

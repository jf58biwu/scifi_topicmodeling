 What are you looking at ? I was looking at you and thinking that we don 't do enough of this . What ? Walk around prehistoric jungles ... for days on end looking for a way out ? Yes , something like that . It 's kind of nice don 't you think ... just the two of us ? Yeah , it 's been awhile . Refreshing swim might be nice . - How is it ? - Oh , you tell me . - What ? - It 's a cave . It could be a passage through the mountains . leading to a way home . There do you see it ? That 's the whole message . Found fissure through mountains hurry . What ? They found it . I knew there had to be a way through those damn mountains . Not through there there isn 't . What , what are you talking about ? I 've been through that fissure and it leads to a swamp ... surrounded by even higher mountains ... and filled with some very nasty dinosaurs . Well we better warn them right away . It could take them all day to get here . - If they got our message . - Of course they did . We might as well make sure it actually leads somewhere . Alone with you in the dark that could lead somewhere . Light the torch . You know this could just be the home of some large prehistoric animal . Well that 's why you 're here , you go first . Ladies first . Daylight . Guess we don 't need these anymore . It 's a lot brighter than daylight . What is that ? I don 't know . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World . Roxton ? Roxton where are you ? I 'm right here Marguerite take my hand . I don 't know if this is such a good idea . We 've come this far there 's nothing to be afraid of . What is that sound ? Must have something to do with this light . I wonder where it 's coming from . - I can 't see a thing . - It 's way too bright for me . It 's coming from that rock on the other side of the valley . It 's reflecting the sun . It 's like a mirror . I wonder what Challenger would have to say about this ? I 'm sure when he sees it he 'll go on about it for hours . But apart from this fascinating phenomenon ... it looks like we 've reached another dead end . Except for that . Maybe they can point us in the right direction . Looks peaceful enough from here . Look at them can 't wait to drink their money away . Push up the prices a little and they 'll never know the difference . Not them but their wives should feel the pinch Mr. Grey . Oh they get by women are good at scrimping and saving . Isn 't that right Josie ? I bet you 've got a mattress full of money . Well if I did I wouldn 't be working ... for the likes of you in a place like this now would I ? Not that this ain 't a nice establishment ... and you both ain 't respectable gentlemen . If you don 't look too closely that is . I don 't know why I don 't throw you out on the street . - Two reasons . - Um ? And you 're lookin at both of them . Afternoon folks don 't get up my business is at the bar . You again . Drop it . Someone has to keep you honest Edgar . Who are you ? How do you know my name ? I told you that the last time I robbed you . I 'm your punishment , here to inflict on you the same degree of suffering that you inflict on all those around you . You won 't get away with this . As long as you do I will . Time to pay the piper again . Don 't be shy everyone here knows that your ... pockets are full because theirs are empty . Thieving unscrupulous wench . Jewelry too . Drinks are on the house . No one does this to me ! I 'll see you hanged for this ! We all have our dreams Edgar . The village can 't be that much further . What 's the hurry ? Why ? Do you have something else in mind ? Now , I have you 're undivided attention . What the ... ? I wouldn 't . What the hell was that ? - Some kind of an outlaw . - Yeah an amateur ... looks like she dropped her back of loot . Stolen goodies . She must have robbed someone in the village . Fair 's Fair . She almost ran us down . Yes and I think we should try and find the rightful owner . Finder 's keepers . - Well , looks fairly civilized . - Compared to what ? You hear me ! Come back when you can stand up ! Now there 's a pleasant surprise . Even you wouldn 't stop for a pint ? It 's been a while since you bought me a drink . - Are they staring at me or you ? - You I hope . I see you 're open for business . Well that depends on whether you 've come to rob the place ... or buy a round . You 're mad coming in here with that . This ? Oh we just found it . Sure you did . No , it 's true . The woman who dropped it almost ran us down . - Best put it away now . - But we came to return it . You two are under arrest , hands on your heads . Under arrest for what ? Thank you . There must be some mistake . That 's enough out of you whoever you are . Get their weapons . Come on ! come on . This is ridiculous . The woman that you want is still out there . Right and she gave you the money that she stole . Good work Hyde . Well well ... at last we meet face to face without the mask . And who are you ? Come now there 's no need to pretend any longer . I have a list of charges as long as your arm . You 've been caught red handed . See , this is what happens when you try and do the right thing . We brought your money back there should be a reward . Reward ? Absolutely , after your trial you will be treated to a public execution . And you , you will hang as her accomplice . We ran into the woman you 're looking for on the way into the village . She almost ran us down . Do you think I am fooled by your phony accent ? Three times you have robbed and threatened me . Your trial will begin today and end tomorrow . Justice will be swift . And blind ! Maybe they didn 't get our message and went to explore the fissure anyway . If they did the dinosaurs will chase them out in a hurry . Look out ! Don 't even think about it . Drop it and the rest . What do you want ? You look like well heeled travelers . You intend to rob us ? You must be the brains of the outfit . We don 't have any money . I don 't want your money just your weapons and ammunition . You can 't leave us out here unarmed . Unarmed or dead it 's your choice . - We 'll track you down . - Good luck to you , in two days I 'll be gone forever . But where did you come from ? Are there anymore like you around here ? Most of them aren 't as friendly . Good think I have your weapons . Fine looking guns they are too . Gone forever in two days . Do you think she knows a way off the plateau ? I thought your friend said there was going to be a trail before the execution ? This is it , we like the accused to face the punishment ... of what 's in the future . Something tells me there isn 't going to be much of a trail . Move it . Marguerite , I 'm going to make a run for it . - What about me ! - You can help me just ... don 't worry , I 'm not going to leave you for the hangman . Are you ready ? Fall over . Eh ? Sorry ! Get him ! Stealing my gun and I thought you were supposed to be Sheriff . Hand over ! Court is now in session . Let her go . - This was all a big mistake . - Put down your gun ... or they 'll be no trial just an execution . Ah , Ah ... another step . You 've only got one shot , you can 't kill us both . He 's aiming at me Roxton . And I cannot miss from here . All right ... we 'll do it your way . This is my way . No ! No ! Roxton ! Put them both in the cell . If he doesn 't see a doctor he is going to bleed to death . And we can save a piece of rope . Oh , no , no , it 's good ... it 's gone right through . It has to be cauterized ... I need something hot enough to burn the flesh . I demand you get a doctor right now ! You demand , you 're in no position to do anything but beg . All right , all right ... I 'm begging you ... please don 't let him bleed to death . How easily you grovel for the life of a worthless scoundrel . All right , give her what she wants . If you want this dog to swing beside you , you can treat the wound yourself . What ? They were here all right . Went in but haven 't come back out . Maybe they 're on their way back . That woman came out here too . But no hoof prints leading back in . I wonder if Roxton and Marguerite ran into her . When it 's red hot ... you press it against the wound and you hold it there ... until it sears the blood vessels you understand ? I can 't do it . Come on it 's going to hurt me a lot more than it hurts you . That a girl . Nothing to it . I 'm sorry . You know , I really think you mean that . You can thank me later . That wasn 't here last time . Strange . What is it ? Where is it coming from ? What is that noise ? Sounds like an atmospheric pressure differential . There must be mineral deposits in that rock , what brilliance . The sun is reflecting off that cliff . Strange , I didn 't see that last time I was here . Maybe the cliff was in shadow . Of course , because the angle of the sun 's ray changes ... as the earth orbits the sun . That 's right Malone . In fact , it 's likely that the sun only hits those rocks ... a few days every year . What 's going on ? Everything 's different . What about that village ? Was that there last time ? No ! No swamp , no dinosaurs and a village that wasn 't there before . How very intriguing . None of this was here before . That woman who robbed us must have come from here . Well that 's right , and she said ... she 'd be gone forever in two days . It seems like two different planes of reality ... have been thrown together there boundaries fused ... by that incredible light . - For two days . - Precisely , so when the sun stops shinning on that rock ... all this could poof just disappear . Just like Marguerite and Roxton . Where are they ? Maybe they popped in for a drink . - No sign of them in here . - Welcome strangers . You look a little lost . I 'm Edgar Grey Attorney , this is Sheriff Hyde . I 'm pleased to meet you . I 'm George Challenger , Ned Malone , Veronica . Were looking for our friends a man and a woman . Oh yes indeed . There has been a misunderstanding . Nothing serious I hope ? No ... no ... not at all , I 'm afraid they just got ... a little rowdy and ended up in jail . No doubt Marguerite 's doing . She 's indeed quite a woman . Why don 't we go down to the jail and sort all this out hm . Please . - What is this ? - Hands on your heads . - You three are under arrest . - What the devil for ? If you are friends with that woman in jail it would ... mean you are part of her gang of bandits . Marguerite is no outlaw . The mask has been removed . You 're making a mistake . We were robbed by the same woman . - And she is still at large . - Lock them up . You will be put on trial with your friends in the morning . I said move come on , let 's go . - Move it ! - Malone ! Look two nooses . - Keep moving ! - I think we know who those are for . We won 't be much help to them if we 're all locked up together . You saying we make a break for it now ? If we can find the real bandit maybe we can sort this mess out . Be quiet ! First we have to get out of here . - That shouldn 't be too difficult . - Keep moving ! Amazing ! Just think about it ... two days ago none of this was here ! Just a swamp full of frenzied vicious flesh eating dinosaurs ! Where are you going huh ? Run ! Get up ! Come on ! Wait we can 't just leave Marguerite and Roxton here . That way , move ! Dead or alive don 't matter which ! Doesn 't look like we have much choice now . - There they go , come on . - This way . You know I was dreaming . You were feeding me grapes on the banks of a stream . That 's what we should have done . You saved my life . You promised to save me from the hangman . Is that the only reason ? No ! I should get shot more often . Not till you get us out of here . I really must be dreaming . We 've got to lose them or take them out before we hit open ground again . You mean before we make our run for the fissure ? - How about a little ambush ? - Good idea . There he is . I give up . I 'm beat sure is lonely down here . Nice work you two . Let 's go . Time to get out of here . It 's good to see you 're feeling better , any ideas ? I was hoping this part of the dream would just disappear . It will do that all by itself . By sundown tomorrow whatever lies ... beyond the fissure will have disappeared forever . What are you talking about ? For two days each year . Two different worlds are brought together by some ... freak of nature . But when the earth is moved a little and the sun ... no longer hits that cluster of sparkling rocks ... then everything returns to normal . What exactly is normal to you ? Towns , farms , villages much like this one . Ignorant peasants going about their daily lives ... secure in the knowledge that people like me ... are watching over them ... keeping order . Normal sounds pretty horrible to me . Small villages like this have been your stock and trade . I wouldn 't waist my time in a place like this . I 'm with you . I prefer the dinosaurs and savages on the other side . - Sounds horrifying . - You 've never seen it ? Last year was a frozen wasteland ... the year before a desert , every year something different . You have to let us go . You know we haven 't committed any crimes . But I don 't know that at all . You keep pretending that you don 't know anything but why should I believe you ? Flaunting your ill gotten gains in my tavern I should have hanged you on the spot . But we 're not savages yet . No you haven 't evolved quite that far , yet . The woman you 're looking for is still out there . Maybe you 're right but it doesn 't matter . What ? Well the Masked Bandit is a prize catch ... if you 're not her you 'll have to do . The good people of this village want a hanging and ... I am just their humble servant . My hands are tied . Keep going ! I wonder where the others are . I certainly wouldn 't be disappointed to see them right about now . Maybe they couldn 't find the fissure . I 'm sorry we found it . If we don 't catch this woman soon we 're going to have to go back there without her . How far do you think she 'll ride before she gives her horse a rest ? Depends on how cool she is and how bad she wants to get away . Let 's hope she likes her horse more than she likes people otherwise we 're never going to catch her . Wait ! Raptor . Useless piece of junk . Come on over here my beauty ! Over here ! Thank you very much . How did you do that ? It 's a little more sophisticated than your flintlock . - Can I see it . - Ah ah . Nice try , this end only . We 've come to take you back . Yes , your friends in the village are waiting . I can 't go back there , Grey will hang me . Maybe you deserve it . - Much more than our friends do . - Ah . Hidden behind a cowards mask ... she takes the bread from our mouths and ... fills our hearts and souls with fear . Who knows how many have been the victim of this ... dangerous woman . Your honor I urge you to listen to the people , the innocent people and put an end to this reign of terror . The Masked Bandit and her accomplice must die . - Yes ! - Yes ! Oh it 's all over before any of the evidence is even presented . You know I think that 's the general idea . You can 't honestly expect me to go back ... there and to turn myself in for a complete stranger . You know it 's the right thing to do . I stopped doing the right think a long time ago . Around the time Edgar Grey cheated me out of my tavern . - You used to own the tavern ? - My husband and I , until Grey killed him . Shot him in the back outside the tavern . Then he asked me to marry him ... all he really wanted was the tavern . - You didn 't want to sell it to him . - No , so he cut off my supplies I went ... broke and he took it over anyway . That doesn 't justify a life of crime . Oh I don 't know ... he took from me a good deal more ... than I 've ever taken from him . And others , now it 's time for an even trade . Let 's go . It is the verdict of this court that this woman ... is the Masked Bandit ... and therefore guilty of all crimes . The penalty is death by hanging ... to be carried out immediately . I guess this is a good time to appeal the verdict . This is the part we 've all been waiting for . You 're a fool Edgar you know I 'm not ... the woman that you 're looking for . If you execute us you 'll never learn about our secret . You have a minute tell me now . Hang on ! Hang on ! On the other side of the fissure ... we have found precious gems ... beyond your wildest imagination . Would you like to see some ? Come on ! Hang on . I suppose the good citizens can wait a moment longer . Hang on . Take him back to the cell . Don 't worry , I won 't leave you for the hangman . Yes , you will . This way . Good I 'll have a martini extra dry with a twist of lemon . Sit down ! Show me these gems . These are just tiny samples ... of what you will find in great abundance . Give them to me . A short excursion through the fissure just a few hours away ... and you could be a very wealthy man . The three gems you are holding in your hand could make me wealthy enough getting them I think would be a lot easier . There are many places I could lose them ... between here and the gallows . I could take them now . Only by killing me ... and then you wouldn 't get to hang me ... in front of all your people . You know it is unfortunate we had to meet this way . You and I are very much alike I think . You know if you 're not out of this valley by sundown ... you could be stuck here forever . We 'll be long gone by then . Do you honestly think Edgar Grey is going to let your friends go . Why wouldn 't he it 's you he 's after . You clearly don 't know him well enough . He keeps the villagers in the dark about the ... fissure and he has a habit of hanging uninvited visitors . We 'll find out for ourselves soon enough . Yes . Hey ! Yeah ! Wait . Come here . Right there we ... Damn I forgot the gunpowder . - I 'm sure it 's nothing , thunder . - Quiet ! The prisoner has escaped Mr. Grey . You created this little ruse ... to give your friend a chance to escape . Now why would I help him and not myself ? So that he would come back and help you . There 's no chance of that now . We 'll hang her now . Think of the future we could have together . Until I turn my back ... and then you 'll put a knife in it . - You can 't do this . - Someone has to hang ... and we mustn 't disappoint all of these people . Any last words ? Damn you , Roxton . Careful Marguerite it 's not too late to change my mind . Goodbye whoever you are . What the hell is this ? Looks like we arrived just in time . Better late than never . This is madness he 'll kill us all . No , keep walking . - Where 's Roxton ? - What do you want ? This woman is the Masked Bandit . After her quickly I 'll get Marguerite . Hang her ! Sorry , not today . Couldn 't leave without stealing something could you ? - I need a weapon . - No you don 't . Really wasn 't his day , was it ? - How are we going to help the others ? - I don 't know . Come on let 's get out of here . Did you learn your lesson Sheriff . I want them all ! Where are the others ? Make for the tavern . Now is not the time to stop for a drink . Nor is it time to have only one gun . I 'll keep you covered , go ! Open the door . Barricade the door . We 've got to find a way out of here . And quickly sundown is rapidly approaching . It 's you they want . Take it easy the fight 's outside ! That 's enough ! We could be stuck here for ever because of you ! - You got here all by yourself . - Now this is not solving anything . This woman does not deserve to be hanged any more than you do . Let 's work together on this thing huh . We can get out through the roof . What do we do Edgar ? Kill them all . Surround the place , burn it down ! You heard him get going ! Get some torches ! Burn it ! Looks like they 're going to try to burn us out . More like burn us alive . Come on let 's go . That might get us out of the building but we need some ... kind of diversion to get us out of the village . I 'll turn myself in . That should give you time to get away . Wait , I 've got a better idea . Light it up . Edgar it 's me I want to come out . Smells like a trap . Why do you want to come out ? Let the others go it 's me you want . - Don 't listen to her . - Shut up ! - Tell the men to hold off . - Wait . Come out ! Let the others go . You 're in no position to bargain . What about now ? - How did you get those ? - I 'm a bandit remember ... forced into a life of crime because if you . Go ! Go ! Come on Challenger let 's not dawdle . You give me the gems . As soon as you let the others go . Well that 's not going to happen now . Burn it down ! Now let 's take off that mask hmmm . If you insist . Drop it . You 're not the Bandit . Oh but I am you were right all along . And as you have made others suffer so too shall you . I 'll be back . Damn . - Where is she ? - She 'll be here . I hope so because we 're running out of time . Not a moment too soon . You should have seen his face . Do you think he fell for it ? I 'm sure he did . Your identity is still a secret . - I don 't know how to thank you . - Keep robbing Edgar ... it 's the least you can do for our mutual friend . - Come on we have to hurry . - What about your clothes ? Keep them they suit you . Time to go . Come on sun 's setting . - Good luck . - Thank you . - Travel safe . - I will . - She was quite a woman . - That she was . But let 's not forget who got us out of that little jam . Quite right without Marguerite we might still be living back there . I think we owe you a debt of gratitude . I never thought I 'd live to hear it . Sounds like everything 's back to normal . Yes , well normal sounds horrible to me . *

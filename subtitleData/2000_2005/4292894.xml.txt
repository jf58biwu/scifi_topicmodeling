 It is Friday , December 8 ... and you 're tuned in to WXOP , Baltimore 's news radio ... serving all of Maryland ... and the greater Chesapeake region , 2 4-7 . We 've got your Friday morning trouble spots : a two-car pileup with a fatality , on the 97 at ... [ Buzzer ] It 's time . John ! Press got word you 're taking him ... out the Groves Street exit . It looks like Woodstock out there . I suggest you postpone the transfer . We can get him out later once the crowd disperses . Transfer me where ? No , they 'll camp out for days . We 're going ahead with it . John . John , what is going on ? Mr. Wells ! Mr. Wells ! Why did you do it ? All right , back up ! Give him some room . Come on , clear out . Back up . Al . Down ! Weapon ! [ Yelling ] [ Voice Echoing ] Somebody call a medic ! [ Heartbeat ] [ Heartbeat Slowing ] [ Heartbeat Stops ] [ Buzzer ] John ... Do you recognize this , Mr. Wells ? Have you seen it before ? Um ... yes . Who are you ? Don 't even ... - Martin . - John , what am I doing here ? I 'm in this cell , I don 't know where I am ... or how I even got here ... and everyone 's acting like ... Swear to God , on top of everything else , do not play this with me . I will not be party ... to some half-assed , 1 1 th-hour insanity defense . What ? John ... It 's time to start telling me the truth ! This key card , Mr. Wells ... You do recognize it . Is that correct ? Yes , it 's the swipe card ... that they use at the apartment building . For all I know , it 's mine . It is yours . It was found in the dumpster behind the Strand Hotel . You tossed it there , didn 't you ? You had just enough time ... to drive to Baltimore and commit the murder . Wait . Murder ? What murder ? Then drive back to D.C. toss the key card . That way , you could claim it was stolen . Make it look like you spent your whole night ... watching pay-per-view in your hotel room . Right ? Please ... What murder ? What is he talking about ? Well , maybe this will jog your memory , buddy . Vickie . My wife . This isn 't happening . This is not happening . Court van is waiting . All right ... dignity . That is your strong suit . Play it . Don 't lower your eyes . It makes you look guilty . Now , we drew Judge Kinberg . What 's your relationship with him ? Benjamin ? First-name basis . Excellent . [ Bailiff ] All rise . I would remind the members of the gallery ... to turn off all cellular phones and paging devices . Al ? What ? He shot me . Who ? Your father-in-law ? What are you talking about ? Circuit Court , Department 6-B is now in session ... the Honorable Benjamin Kinberg presiding . Thursday , the seventh day of December . Thursday ? It 's not Thursday . Shh ! It 's Saturday . Yesterday was Friday and ... Today is Thursday . There 's no court on Saturday . You know that . Martin , do you feel all right ? [ Judge Pounds Gavel ] Case Number 8ABX03 : District v. Martin Wells . Charge of first-degree murder . The defense has requested a hearing on bail ? Yes , Your Honor , we have . As I 'm sure you 'd agree , Mr. Wells ' status ... as a prosecutor makes him a target . The court puts his life in danger ... by keeping him in custody . Your Honor , I have the assurances ... of the Baltimore Department of Corrections ... that Mr. Wells ' safety while in custody is not a concern . Furthermore , as Your Honor will certainly agree ... Mr. Wells is an upstanding ... citizen and a respected member of the Maryland Bar ... held in high esteem by all his peers . Your Honor , with cold calculation , Martin Wells ... brutally stabbed his wife in their own home . He poses a threat to the public and should be denied bail . He doesn 't pose a threat to anyone , Your Honor ... and he has two small children ... who need him at home . Why ? Because their mom 's not around . Ms. Carter . Martin , I can 't tell you how sorry I am ... to see you on that side of the aisle . I hope you 'll forgive me when I do exactly what you ... as a prosecutor , would demand . Bail is denied . I will , however ... order Mr. Wells transferred to a more secure ... facility in the interest of his safety . Transferred ? No , Ben . You can 't do that . I can 't be transferred . He 'll kill me . Tomorrow morning- - if today is really Thursday- - then tomorrow is Friday ... and that 's when he 's going to do it . He 's going to shoot me as I 'm being transferred . Bailiff . You don 't understand ! It 'll happen ! It 'll happen ! Judge , listen to me ! Ben , it 'll happen ! He 's going to kill me ! Ben ! Mr. Wells ... we understand that you had an interesting morning in court . What is it that you 'd like to speak with us about ? You 'reJohn 's partner ? For God sakes , Martin . Agent Scully . You know that . You met her yesterday . Yesterday ? Yeah . Yesterday . Wednesday . Wednesday ? Are you saying that you don 't remember ? What is the last thing that you do remember ? Being shot by my father-in-law . You 're wasting our time . Listen . I don 't know what I experienced . But what if it was a premonition ? A glimpse of the future . I mean , you do hear about these kind of things . Yes ... you do . Mr. Wells , this shooting aside ... is there anything else that you remember before that ? Um ... I was in D.C ... uh ... for a sentencing hearing . I was staying at the Strand Hotel like you said . That was three days ago , Mr. Wells . Are you telling us that ... you don 't remember anything else ? Not the murder of your wife ? No . Out of the blue . Charged with murder . You wake up one morning ... and you can 't remember a damn thing . Martin , you haven 't offered us ... one scrap of evidence to support your story . Now , as your friend , I 'm going to listen ... to anything you have to say , but I will not be lied to . I 'm not lying to you . You 're talking to me about key cards . I 'm sitting in a jail cell . I don 't understand any of this . I don 't understand any of this . But I did not ... kill Vickie . If you truly don 't remember ... then how can you be certain that you didn 't ? Courtney ! Haley ! Hey , guys ! Oh ! It 's so good to see you . Wh ... ? ! Come on ! Come on , give Daddy a big hug . Hug your father , ninas . Mmm ... How are they holding up ? Good . Good , Mr. Wells . They want to know when you 're coming home . Oh . See , um ... Daddy has some things that he has to do- - very , very important things . That 's why I have to be here ... right now , but then , guess what ? I 'll be coming home . Grandpa says they won 't let you come home . Oh ... [ Gasps ] Trina , I need you to get me something out of the apartment- - something from the girls ' room . Thank you . Why didn 't you mention this to me before the bail hearing ? I hadn 't even met you before the bail hearing . Nanny-cam . Oh , Martin , I wish you 'd talked to me about this before . I really don 't know if this is a great idea . This tape may have the murderer on it . Whatever happens to be on that tape ... you know that I am an officer of the court . I have to share this with the prosecution . You think I 'm guilty ? Let 's ... let 's clear this up right now . Here . My apartment . That ... that 's the girls ' room ... and this must be the police investigation . What time did the murder occur ? The official report has the police arriving ... at your apartment at 6 : 20 a.m. Monday morning . Your key card was used at 4 : 1 7 . Which means the killer is somewhere in-between . Wait . There 's your wife . Um ... we must have missed something . Right there . Martin , that 's you . [ Door Buzzes ] I 'm not going . How 's that ? I told you . This is the day . If I go , I 'll get shot . You cannot transfer me . I don 't plan to . Your lawyers want to see you . [ Whispers ] There 's my favorite client . Martin , you holding up all right ? Brent , uh ... I 've been better . We 're going to beat this thing . Guaranteed . Martin , I have here one of the finest ... criminal defense specialists in the country . I want you to meet ... We met . I 've been thinking all night about the tape ... and I don 't see you having to turn it over to the prosecution . I 'm sorry ? I obviously showed you that tape in a good faith effort ... to clear my name , not as an admission of guilt . Um ... Mr. Wells , I 'm Janet Wilson . I don 't think we 've met . Martin , what is all this about a videotape ? The ... nanny-cam tape . That 's why you 're here , right ? I 'm here to introduce you to your new attorney . We met yesterday at the bail hearing . Don 't you remember ? Martin , the bail hearing is set for tomorrow . [ Martin ] What day is this ? What ... day of the week ... is this ? Wednesday . Wednesday the sixth . Yesterday you told me it was Thursday . The day before that it was Friday . It 's backwards . Everything 's going backwards . Martin , I think we should have you speak to someone . You 're under a hell of a lot of stress . Being locked up in this cesspool really doesn 't help . We can have you out of here by tomorrow afternoon . The prosecution 's case is weak to say the least . They have no physical evidence tying you to the crime scene . Plus , they don 't have the key card ... that was used to access your apartment building . [ Exhales Sharply ] The key card . Without it , they 've got nothing . [ Man ] Oh , yeah . [ Laughs ] Somebody likes you , my brother . [ Chuckles ] Come on , man . I 'm just messing with you . What , you ain 't got no sense of humor , counselor ? Do I know you ? No , you don 't know me . Damn sure put me in here , though . Possession with intent . And concealed weapon . Mm-hmm . That concealed weapon was a pipe wrench . I was on my way to my baby 's mama 's house ... to unstick the Pepsi caps from out her garbage disposer ... but I told you all that ! " Concealed weapon " added six months to my sentence , man . You remember my name ? No , I don 't remember your name . All I needed to know about you was that you broke the law . I broke the law . Well , then , I guess that makes you " Wife Killer , Esq . " [ Laughs ] Yo ! Pick ' em up ... you stumbling bitch . [ Prisoner ] Come on . [ Screams ] [ Basketball Bouncing ] [ Moaning ] [ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Door Opens ] [ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Door Closes ] Aw , geez , Martin . Your face . It 's all right . Appreciate your coming to see me . Agent Scully , I especially wanted to talk to you . It 's nice to meet you . I 'm sorry it 's not under better circumstances . This is the day we meet . Something is happening to me ... something I need to try to explain to you both . I 'm moving backward in time . Every morning I wake up , it 's the day before . For me , yesterday was Thursday ... the day before that was Friday , only it 's all new to me . Every single morning I wake up , I can only remember ... what 's happened the following day . Agent Scully , would you mind taking a closer look ... at his injuries , maybe check his scalp ? I know this all sounds crazy . But I 'm telling you the truth . This cut , for instance . It was on my cheek when I woke up yesterday . I woke up this morning , it wasn 't there . But then this afternoon ... I got cut . I killed a spider in my cell yesterday . First thing this morning , I woke up , it 's back again . Because it happened the day before . I haven 't actually killed it yet . Mr. Wells , are you saying that ... you don 't remember the day that your wife was murdered ? I 'm talking about two days ago , Monday . No , I don 't ... remember it ... because for me , it hasn 't happened yet . You do realize that , uh ... you 're not going to be able to prove this , right ? I mean , if , uh ... if tomorrow is really the day before today ... then we won 't have had this conversation . Oh , for crying out loud . It means you 're going to have to tell us all over again . Yeah , well , uh ... make sure I skip that freaking meeting . Mr. Wells , let 's say that all this is true . Why do you think it 's happening ? I don 't know . There has to be a reason . What reason ? Something ... I 'm meant to understand ? Although I don 't know what it could be . Maybe you already have the answer within you . [ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Door Closes ] I 'd really prefer to stay while you do this . Martin . I can take you through the chain of evidence . I think I 've done this before , thank you , Ms. Wilson . Mmm-hmm , looking for some loopholes , huh ? Yeah , man , get yourself out of here . They just praying that you find that one little technicality ... so they can let you go . I 'm not looking for technicalities . Well , what are you looking for , brother ? The truth . The truth ? [ Laughs ] You better stick to the technicalities ! The truth is going to keep you in here ... and make you somebody 's bitch ... that 's what the truth 's going to do . So put on that engineering hat , CaseyJones ... because you 've got a whole lot of trains to be pulling ... [ Laughs ] [ Imitates Train Whistle ] [ Imitates Train Chugging ] The truth ! [ Sobs ] [ Cries ] I know who did it . [ Reporter ] ... claims he arrived home from a business trip ... to discover the body of his wife in their living room . Apparently , Wells is now in seclusion ... at the home of a friend . Baltimore Police are giving no indication ... whether he is a suspect in the murder ... or if there are indeed any suspects at this time . However , Channel 9 News has learned police are focusing ... their investigation on the whereabouts ... of an electronic key card , much like this one . The card in question belongs to Martin Wells . It was used by the killer to enter the Calvert House ... apartment building through the garage entrance . Wells claims no knowledge of the whereabouts of his key card ... Not something you want to wake up to . - ... and suggests it may have been stolen . - [ Clicks ] How you feeling ? Disconnected from reality ... but I guess I 'd better get used to it . Oh , um ... thank you . I assume you ... let me spend the night here , right ? Thank you . Like I said , no problem . So that makes today- - Tuesday ... the day after the murder . John ... I know who did it now . You know who killed Vickie ? Mmm . Latino , maybe 40 , five-ten , 1 85 pounds . He 's got a tattoo of a spiderweb on his left hand . Martin , last night you told me you had no idea who did this . Yeah , now I do . Well , trust me . I mean , I-I don 't know his name ... but you can find him in the Baltimore City lockup . Call them . They can I.D. him based on what I just told you . [ Remote Control Clicks ] [ Al ] I just want to say ... my daughter was an exceptional person ... [ Sighs ] ... one who was loved by everyone who knew her . [ Reporter ] Sir , have the police identified any suspects ... in your daughter 's death ? They 're not telling us much . What about rumors that your son-in-law is the prime suspect ? What are your thoughts on that ? Reporting from the Calvert House Apartments ... this is Brian Blakley . Back to you in the studio . No prisoner fitting that description ... has been processed in the past 36 hours . He 's in there . He 's got to be there . Sorry , Martin , he 's not . It must be too soon . He must not get arrested until later today- - Tuesday . That 's how he could have been with me in lockup on Wednesday . Martin , you have seriously lost me . If you 're trying to admit something to me or to yourself ... I want you to just come out with it . There 's a reason all this is happening . Maybe I already have the answer . Well , how 's that ? There 's something in my apartment that you need to see , John . Where is it ? Uh , the girls bedroom , right there . [ Glass Shattering ] [ Screams ] Martin ? Is this it ? My daughters were at their grandparents ' ... thank God . Their bedroom door was open ... with a clear view of the front hallway . The nanny-cam is motion-activated ... so it should have caught anyone coming in or out of the house . [ Tape Rewinds ] There I am . Nobody else on the tape between my wife and the police . I don 't understand it . I 'd say this makes you look more innocent than guilty . Look , there- - in the mirror the sun . Your wife comes home ... before the murderer enters the building at 4 : 1 7 a.m. Her time of death is fixed shortly after that well before sunrise . You came home later , when the sun was already up . The killer turned off the tape . The only question is how ? There 's a remote control for the nanny-cam . It 's in a drawer by the front door ... but nobody else knew about it except for ... Vickie ... and me . Are you sure about that ? [ Knocks On Door ] FBI ! I saw your curtains move . I know you 're in there . [ Door Unlatches ] M-Mr . Wells , I ... Trina , you knew about the nanny-cam , didn 't you ? You told the killer about it . You must have given him my key card , too . Mr. Wells , I-I-I wasn 't even there that night . First thing you 're supposed to say is : " What nanny-cam ? " Is this your guy ? [ Trina Crying ] I 'm so sorry , Mr. Wells . He said he 'd hurt my family . He made me give him your key card . [ Trina Sobbing ] [ Door Closes ] His name is Caesar Okompo . He 's got a full sheet- - assault and narcotics . He knows the drill . He 's a clam . We 'll have Trina 's testimony against him . Or maybe we won 't . He 's got her so scared we can 't count on her . [ Phone Rings In Distance ] John , let me go in and talk to him . Please . He says he only wants to talk to you . [ Door Opens ] Why ? You don 't know ? You got my name , my record , and you can 't figure it out ? Caesar Okompo- - I don 't know you . I never prosecuted you . Hector Okompo , my brother . What was the charge ? Possession with intent . $ 50 worth of rock . It was his third strike , remember ? Yeah , I remember . I did my job . You sent him up for life ! I did my job ! I do it ten times a week every week of the year ... and for this , my wife was murdered ? You take away my dignity , my reputation , my life ... because your dirtbag brother is where he belongs ? ! Brady v. Maryland . Hey , you know what I 'm talking about . Brady v. the State of Maryland . Prosecution 's got to turn over exonerating evidence . You had the word of three people that wasn 't Hector 's rock . It was in a jacket that wasn 't even his ... left beside him in the club . You knew that . You knew that and you suppressed the evidence . Are you trying to tell me that your brother is not a drug dealer ? My brother was a busboy when you sent him up . He had two strikes on him . He wasn 't dealing no more . You sent him up for who he used to be ... and ' cause it was easy . You broke the law . I tell you what we 'll do . You 're going to be convicted of my wife 's murder one way or another . Plead out now and I 'll look into your brother 's case . Maybe I 'll find a way to recommend a reduced sentence . Time served . You want justice ? So do I. My brother is dead . Hung himself in a jail cell a couple weeks ago . Martin ... a word . I 'm sorry , Martin . I tried to talk them out of it , but they think they have a case . Sir , turn around , please . Martin Wells , you are under arrest ... for the murder of Vickie Wells . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used ... against you in a court of law . You have the right to an attorney . [ Mumbling ] Come on , honey , pick up . [ Ringing ] Pick up ! [ Vickie ] Hey , there . Vickie ... This is the Wells ' residence ... home of Martin , Vickie , Courtney and Haley . We can 't come to the phone right now . So , please leave a message . [ Beeps ] Honey , this is Martin . Pick up the phone . Vickie , pick up the phone . Pick up the phone ! It 's not 4 : 00 yet . Vickie , please , when you get this ... get out of the apartment , go to your parents ' house ... and wait for me to call . I 'm on my way back to the city . [ Dog Barking Nearby ] John , I need your help . Martin ? Vickie 's going to be murdered inside of two hours . Vickie ? You mean your wife ? I called the Baltimore Police but I can 't tell ... if they thought I was a crank . I need you to call them . Now , I can describe the suspect , his name ... everything . Well , how do you know all this ? No time to explain . You wouldn 't believe it anyway . Now , Martin , you see , now , that 's a bad sign ... because it 's two - something in the morning . I haven 't seen you in three years . You got to give me something more to go on . This is all happening for a reason . I ... I 'm being given a second chance . A second chance to do what ? I prosecuted a man named Hector Okompo . I suppressed evidence . See , he was innocent of the crime he was charged with . Martin , anything you say to me ... You have to report . I put him away , he died in prison ... his brother wants revenge , and it is as simple as that . You could be disbarred for what you 're telling me . You could go to prison , lose everything ; do you understand ? I understand that I can save Vickie . Hold on a minute . [ Dial Tone Buzzing ] [ Phone Tones Beeping ] [ Indistinct Radio Chatter ] [ Panting ] [ Relieved Sighing ] You got here in time . Are you Martin Wells ? Yeah . Vickie ? Vickie ? There 's nobody here . We checked . What exactly are we looking for ? My wife 's going to be attacked here tonight . It happens ... The killer 's going to use my key card to enter at 4 : 1 7 . It 's 4 : 20 now . I don 't understand . Where is she ? Tell you what . We 'll take a few sweeps through the neighborhood , keep our eyes peeled . We 're a phone call away if you need us . [ Phone Beeps ] [ Speed-dialing ] [ Ringing ] Come on . Come on ! [ Al ] Hello ? Al , it 's Martin . Martin ? What time is it ? Al ... [ Clears Throat ] is-is Vickie there ? No . The kids are here . Vickie left hours ago . - [ Bumping ] - Isn 't she home yet ? [ DoorknobJiggles ] Martin ? [ Phone Drops In Cradle ] [ DoorknobJiggling ] [ Panting ] [ Screams ] [ Panting ] Martin , you scared the hell out of me ! Honey , why aren 't you in D.C. ? What the ... Where have you been ? I-I got a flat on the way back from my ... Honey , you 're scaring me . What 's wrong ? - We 're in trouble . We have to get out of here now . - What ? ! [ Whispers ] Vickie ! Get in the bedroom . Lock the door . You call the cops ... and don 't come out till I say it 's okay . [ Both Yelling ] Come on ! [ Both Grunting ] [ Yelling ] [ Crashing ] [ Grunting ] Oh , my God , Martin ! [ Vickie Screams ] Martin ! No ! [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] Martin ! [ Panting Heavily ] Martin ! [ Crying ] No ! [ Gunshots ] [ Sobbing ] You said something about a second chance . Was this it ?

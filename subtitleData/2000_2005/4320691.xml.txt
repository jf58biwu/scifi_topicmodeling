 Futurama [ 4x05 ] - Leela 's Homeworld - CiWaN Good news , everyone ! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up ? Sure , we talk about it all the time . Really ? No . Burn ! Well done , fellows ! Anyway , said orphanarium has named Leela " Orphan of the Year ! " Your parents must be so proud ! Sorry . And the good news keeps on coming . Behold my latest invention ! Whoa . It 's a glow-In-The-Dark nose you can wear over your regular non-Glowing nose . Observe . Whoa ! Cool ! Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark . Where 'd it go ? Hey , professor , what 's all this scroop blurking out of the machine ? That ? It 's nothing . Yes , nothing . If you think it 's anything , you 're a suspicious moron . It looks like toxic waste . And it smells like toxic waste ! What does it taste like ? Delicious fig pudding ! That 's good . But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste . All right , all right . So the machine produces a few toxic byproducts . You don 't have to make a federal case of it . I 'm afraid I do . I order you to dispose of that toxic waste or bribe me . Either way , it 'll cost $ 500 . Five hundred real dollars ? That 's an outrage ! Professor , I 'll take care of that waste for $ 499 and 100 cents . I know That 's a rip , but I 'll pay for the convenience . Do you take credit cards ? Let 's find out . All right , environment , you 've met your match . Hey , get back in the sewer , weirdie . No mutants on the surface . But he ruined my wedding dress ! Honey , that thing was ruined the minute it went on you . That 's what I 'm talking about . It 's not easy being an orphan . Not if I have anything to do with it . Oh , God . But today 's honoree , Turanga Leela , has really made something of herself . I 'll never forget the night that cute alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep ... Because I have a photographic memory , and I remember every night . What the- - ? An alien language ? I guess you 're an alien . What a beautiful , gigantic eye you have- - Well , come on in . From those humble beginnings ... Leela went on to become a county-Certified starship captain . And so it is my pleasure today ... To nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni . Thank you very much . Like many of you , I never knew my parents . I don 't know if they were mighty alien overlords ... Or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side . Picture 's up . It 's crooked ! In the end , though , it doesn 't matter who my parents were . All that matters is what I learned here , within these unscalable walls ... That I had the strength to make it on my own . Just like all of you kids here today . Leela ! Leela ! Leela ! Look at me ! I 'm Leela ! No ! Because I 'm double Leela ! Whee ! That 's it , Albert . No more espresso for you ! Mind if we get a picture of you with your picture ? Yes ! I mean , no ! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side . Whoo ! If those aren 't tears of happiness , please stop crying . It 's okay , Fry . I 'm fine . I won an award today . Is it this room that 's making you sad ? It 's probably the room . Come on , let 's go for a walk . I 'm sorry you saw that , Fry . I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside ... Where it can fester quietly as a mental illness . Yeah , I do that with my stupidness . I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong . But all I really wanted was a mom and dad ... To hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they love me . Then today 's your lucky day ... Because I happen to be a holding , stroking , loving machine . Also spanking . That 's not even close to what I had in mind . Well , anyway , just remember that people care about you . I know . Sometimes , when I 'm lonely ... I look up at the sky , and I get this feeling that somewhere ... On some unknown planet circling a distant star ... My parents are up there looking down on me . Yo , yo , Bazender ! What up ? My dumping business is booming . I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3 ! Bender , cut it out ! First of all , the sewer mutants will be mad . Second , everything else that 's horribly wrong with what you 're doing . Those stupid mutants can 't do anything . You seem to be forgetting one simple fact . Namely , I 'm up here , and they are safely down- - What did I do to deserve this ? Behold ! Our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake . The radioactive waste you dumped in it ... Has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are ! Oh , man . As if our lives weren 't miserable enough already . Tell me about it . Let the punishment commence ! Punishment ? No fair . Bender 's innocent ! The instant you touch these mutateous waters ... Your DNA will be forever altered ... Turning you into horrible mutants like us ! Especially him . Oh . Allow me to demonstrate . It 's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at imperial Hunan . Submerge the prisoners ! Wait . I don 't even have DNA . Why am I screaming ? We 're gonna beat you afterwards . Mutate ! Mutate ! Mutate ! Turanga Leela ! Who said that ? How do you know my real name ? Whee ! What are you doing ? Stop them ! What happened ? I don 't know . I think I saved us somehow . Go after them ! The waters can 't mutate us mutants ! They went this way . Quick , in there ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Great Cheech 's ghost ! What 's this junk ? It looks like a timeline of my whole life . That 's when we saved Earth from an asteroid of garbage . Here 's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while . And this is just last year at Space Mardi gras . It 's like some kind of weird Leela Museum . And I 'm the Leela ! Dude , over here ! It 's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet ! Those are some of my diary pages ! And my screenplay ! And also , for some reason , the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings . Oh , I 'm scared . My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant ! In here ! Capture them ! And then Bender ran . Leela , freak out later . We 're not done escaping yet . Got you . Take this ! Ow ! This time , I 'm calling for the death penalty . Not just because I 'm running for reelection as supreme mutant . Four more years ! Four more years ! Very well . Your attention ! Instead of being tortured to death ... The prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers ... And never allowed to return ! Oh , cruel fate ! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage ? Wait a minute . Why aren 't you gonna kill us anymore ? Yeah ! What are you , chicken ? Shut up , you two . We can kill ourselves when we get home . They 'll need transportation to the surface . Bring in the airship ! Ew ! We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy 's parade balloons . Underdog 's groin , Bart Simpson 's left ear and right shin ... Garfield 's owner John 's forehead . Fire up the sewer gas ! Move it , you ugly normals ! Whoa ! I 'm getting dizzy ! I can 't walk straight ! Come on , Leela . You can do it ! Hurry ! We 're missing our bus ! Hey , what are you doing ? I 'm getting on the bus ! Don 't worry ! I 'll be fine ! They know something about me , and I 've got to find out what . The lake didn 't mutate me . What is going on here ? It worked for me . I used to be a little blond girl named Virginia . Ew ! Who the hell are you ? No one . And watch your language , young lady ! Stop right there ! I don 't wanna hurt you . I didn 't want you to hurt me either . Leela 's nuts . I can 't save her unless I learn more about her past . Isn 't there anything else you can tell me ? Nothing that wouldn 't be a waste of your time . That 's impossible , because my time is worthless ! Well , then there is one thing . It 's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned . But it 's written in Alienese , so no one on Earth can translate it . Not even Brainzilla . Hand it over ! Sure . I just wish I could be more helpful . Would you like some dirt on any other orphans ? I 'm trying to save someone here . I 'll have to come back for those later . Can you translate it ? Of course . But only into Beta-Crypt three ... A language so complex , there 's even less chance of understanding it . I didn 't ask for a completely reasonable excuse . I asked you to get busy . Very well . Doesn 't that machine make noses ? Lt can do other things . Why shouldn 't it ? Of course , even if it is possible to analyze the message ... There 's no way of knowing how long it will take . It could take an hour , or it could take 100 million years . Is it done ? Certainly not . Two dings means it 's done . But not like that . Slightly more rapid . Where did they go ? Good news , Leela ! I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy . Ew ! That 's it ! It 's done ! I can 't believe it ! My mind is boggling ! The analysis of the note is printing out now . It 's a girl . My God ! She 's beautiful ! No extra anythings . What people skills ! She 's completely perfect . In my professional opinion , as an ear , ear , ear , nose and throat doctor ... She is the least mutated mutant ever born . And yet , she 's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant ... Like all of us ! Especially him ! It 's true . Maybe we can do better for her . I made this bracelet so that in some small way , we 'll always be with you ... Even when it doesn 't seem like it . During your entire life , for example . You won 't pass for human , cutie . But if my PhD. in exolinguistics is worth diddlypoop ... This note should convince them you 're an alien . And that 'll be enough to give you a real life . She 'll never know we 're her parents . That 's our gift to her . Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin . I 'm with you . I guess you 're an alien . What a beautiful , gigantic eye you have- - Well , come on in . Keep quiet so she doesn 't hear us . What 's to talk about ? Shh ! Hands up ! Tentacles too ! Don 't say anything stupid , Morris . What is all this ? Am I a game to you ? Or some kind of even more boring Truman show ? Do you believe I 'm your messiah ? The mutant Dalai Lama ? Stop me if I guess it ! Well , actually- - Morris ! And what about this ? Where 'd you get this bracelet ? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby ? Or from my parents ? You robbed my parents , didn 't you ? I bet you sick mutants killed them ! My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth , and you killed them ! Is that it ? Admit it ! Yes . We killed them . You guessed the truth . Because of you , I 'll never know my parents ! I 'll kill you ! That would be best . Stop ! Thanks , Bender ! Don 't do it , Leela ! They killed my parents ! Close . They are my parents . Yes . I had the professor analyze the Alienese letter that was found with you . What does it say ? I don 't know . But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper . A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers . It says , " Your parents love you very much . " We still do . So I 'm not an alien ? I 'm a mutant ? We never wanted you to know . You deserved a better life . You must despise us . You 're my parents . All I 've ever wanted is to know you . This is the happiest moment of my life . Ah .

 most of you will ever be involved with . If any of you have any fears about death , any second thoughts about that ... beautiful new wife of yours screwing every guy you hate ... because you left her a widow , now is your chance to leave . Take off those sunglasses . Get out of here . Anybody else ? Mr. Five ? See to it that Mr. Eleven never gets to that gate alive . This is Agent Samson . You will know him and refer to him only as team leader . His whim is your command . If he tells you to put on a dress and dance , I better see those money-makers shaking . - Am I understood ? - Yes , sir ! These grounds have been split up into ten separate zones . Each zone will be defended by two agents . In the event of an agent 's termination ... the neighboring zone will absorb the weaker one . I don 't like the sound of " an agent 's termination . " I just hope he doesn 't ask us to put on a dress and dance . Mr. Twelve ? Is there something you would like to share with all of us ... or is this a tea party with Mr. Seven ? It is a tea party , sir ! Would you two little ladies like to put on an attractive sundress ... - or perhaps a tube top for this party ? - No , sir ! Team leader , would you like to see them in pretty pink dresses ? No . I don 't want to see them in a dress . Very well . You boys have team leader to thank . If we had it my way , the whole lot of you would be in skirts . Now , knock it off and listen up . It 's their nerves . These are good men . Your sidearms are to be your last line of defense . Civilian casualties will not be tolerated . Now , let 's all cross our fingers ... and we just might see another sunrise . All right , gentlemen , go ahead . Aye , aye , sir ! Here 's where you are wrong , my friend . This woman has killed before . Allegedly . OK , whatever . But she was a big girl . We are talking about a large , healthy woman ... of questionable stability . Oh , you are totally underestimating ... the never-say-die scrappiness of a survivor . Hey , guess what ? Nobody cares who would win ... in a crazy fantasy fistfight between Anne Frank and Lizzie Borden . We never should have brought the henchmen . We 're gonna be the only ones there with henchmen . I 'm gonna have to kill them . Pull over if you see a good place to dump their bodies . I can 't take this . Do you want me to turn around ? Because I will . You were the one that wanted to ... No , no , this tag sale is clearly going to be the event . The Monarch is not going to miss this . No way . We are not going to make a thing out of this . I don 't want to upset the henchmen . Hey , Dean ... I found your doll . That 's an action figure . No , this is your old dolly . Give it ! She 's mine ! Try was yours . Dad put a price tag on it . Well , it 's not his to sell . This is my Princess of Camelot doll ... because ... because ... I should get the money ... and stuff . Cool . I was wondering where this went . Breaker , breaker , one-nine . This here 's the rubber duck . You got a copy on me ? Come on . If Dad 's gonna sell our junk ... we 've gotta find our own way to get a slice of that fat money cake . Aw , wicked ! Check it ! I got it ! And I 'm gonna need your help . Follow me . Brock , you have to learn how to relax . This has a lock on it . We 'll be fine . I just think that with all your advertising ... Who even opens those Valpaks anyway ? You have some dangerous machinery for sale here . I think you 're begging for trouble on this one . I thought you handled all that . And I don 't hear any big ideas from you on how to get some quick cash . Come on ! Most of this stuff is old crap my dad left behind . Doc , you have a table over there with a sign that says ... " Laser death ray bargain bin " ! Well , that 's why you have your little ska band there ... to keep the oddballs in costumes from raising Cain . Everyone is here . It 's quite a turnout . Look over there . It 's the Bearded Specter . Oh , my God , look what he 's got on ! Are those giant shorts or tiny pants ? Who still wears those ? Sweetie , isn 't that the guy from Depeche Mode ? Oh , no way ! Where ? Holy crap , he 's with a girl . Oh , yeah , that guy is totally straight . I saw a whole thing about him on the VH1 . But he 's the guy from Depeche Mode . It 's impossible . - Straight . - Come on ! He 's in Depeche Mode ! Billy , check out that honey-pot over there . That 's the kind of archenemy we need . That 's Dr. Girlfriend . She kicks with that wash-up who thinks it 's cool to wear butterfly wings . You know , the what 's-his-name ? Oh , right . The Monarch . Sure . Wait , that 's Dr. Girlfriend ? People say she 's kind of ... you know ... manly . Totally . And I heard from a reliable source ... that she has a surgically implanted baboon 's uterus . Can they even do that ? Your naivet√© is alarming . I have personally grafted a pony 's face ... onto the abdomen of a well-known celebrity . Is it someone I 've heard of ? I do not kiss and tell . Name ? - You know damn well ... - Name ? Baron Underbheit . One : All persons associated with the Guild of Calamitous Intent ... recognize that by virtue of their presence at an event ... I am well aware of the 1967 Charter of Casual Contact . Und come now ... Why would little old me want to start any trouble ? Spare me the sweet talk and sign here . Place all metallic , explosive , or magical objects in the tray . I 'm sorry . I 'm gonna have to ask you to ... All right . Is there a screen or something I can go behind ? Don 't push your luck . That image is never going to leave my mind . I 'm gonna throw up . Uh , I swear to you , I can taste it . It is all watery under my tongue right now . He 's a total freak . I mean , part of me admires his dedication to looking all menacing ... but that is just gross . So , it 's just the weed whacker then ? Do you have amnesia ? I loaned this utilitarian object to you a month ago ! I purchased this weed whacker ... for the singular design of grooming my lawn ! All right , keep it ! Just take it down a notch . Sorry , I just ... You said you would return it . I get like that . You need a hand here ? I 'm a people person . I could assist you vending your sundries . Why , I would make a whiz-bang salesman ! Fine , you deal with the creepy guys dressed like special creepy guys . - And none of that " step right up " crap . - OK . All right , you two . You have my list and the money . Now I want you back waiting by the Monarch-mobile by 6 : 00 . - I will tolerate no dawdling ! - OK , boss . You can count on us , and we are not gonna screw this up . Ah , thanks for putting that in my head . That 's extra reassuring . Put your mind at ease . Your two best men are on the job . Oh , I 'm sure . And , Twenty-One ? Yeah ? Your barn door is open . Ah , henchmen . You seem to be in good spirits . Right . It 's weird . I was totally convinced that Brock Samson was just gonna ... Oh , my God ! Right ? But he was a big , blond pussycat . I have not been this relaxed since ... - Since when ? - Since ... Whenever . I don 't know . Oh , would you look at that ? It 's just tacky . A cash bar . How typical . Employee Dean , isn 't that your make-believe girlfriend ? - Oh , crap ! Where ? ! - The hat stays on ! You are representing Hankco , son . Show some pride . - Knock it off . - All right . Union says you get a ten-minute break , and I can 't risk another strike . H.E.L.P.eR ! You 're on counter . Look alive ! There he goes . Looks like our little Dean is growing up . I 'm OK ! My shoelace was untied . I 'm not ashamed to say it , H.E.L.P.eR ... I 'm proud of him . I 'm flattered , boys . But I 'm with the Monarch now . And , you know , he 's been arching Dr. Venture ... Venture ! That guy peaked too early . He 's been a joke since he was sixteen . - Sweetie , do we need potholders ? - I better go . You both seem very interesting , and I 'm sure some day ... you will make some lucky villain very happy . Did I mention that Billy here is a severe hydrocephalic ? I was born with way too much cerebrospinal fluid ... which may account for my tremendous I.Q. My mother calls me her little water baby . I 'm an albino . Yeah , you can kill him with light ! You could call yourself the Deadly Flame ... or Hot Pants . Hey , Triana . What are you doing here ? I live right over there . And , you know ... yard sale . Did you find anything to get ? Oh , I found some kitschy junk . You have to see these ! Look at these things ! Giant grandma thunder pants ! Don 't they rule ? ! I have a cramp ... from running into you . Isn 't that weird ? You know , you and I both here ... What are the chances ? I really want to sit down . Man , you 're a mess . We should get you some lemonade . No . Not lemonade . And your change . Now let me just bag this for you . Stop showing off . OK , there you are . And I hope you enjoy your purchase . You are one lucky duck ! Oh , it must be dreamy to have a costumed nemesis ... chasing you ... wringing his gloved hands in concern of your every move ! - You 're kidding , right ? - It just seemed so romantic . Oh , sure , it looks all glamorous from the outside ... but really it 's a huge pain in the ass . They send robots into your lab , break everything ... and does my insurance policy cover archenemies ? No . I 'm jealous . There , I said it . If you want one so bad , take one of mine . We 've been lucky here , but that doesn 't mean it 's not gonna happen . I want security to move ... My contacts ! You knocked out my contact lenses . I want security to move on all possible civilian targets . Mr. Twenty will join you at the ... - Well ? - No way . Come on , I did it ! You have to pay up . I said , " And he helps you look for them . " You so owe me five bucks ! Let 's move the Monarch-mobile to the other side of the lot . It will totally screw with the henchmen 's heads ! I 've never seen this side of you . Oh , wow . That hoagie went right through me . I need to make a deposit at the bank ... so to speak . You dick ! Dr. Orpheus did this ! To exact proper retribution , you can find me at this address . Nights only . What ? What did I do ? When the sun sleeps , the wolves begin to howl . So ? What the hell is going on here ? Did somebody put a sign on my back or something ? Let 's see . That 's the " 7 and the Ragged Tiger " t-shirt , the shrink ray , and the Santa windsock . Uh , this runs on two double-A batteries and superheated phosphates . What ? Is that a tic-tac in there ? And you have a picture of a shrink ray gun on the shrink ray gun . That is totally retarded . If you had , like , a silhouette of a giant guy maybe next to a small guy ... you know , with , uh , ray gun circles coming out ... If you don 't like the logo , it 's a decal . You can scrape it off . Now , do you want it , or are you just gonna skip on over to the Shrink Ray Hut ... and pick up a cheaper one ? Your sarcasm , although a laugh riot , is not making this choice any easier . If you 're not gonna get it , I will . I 'll let you borrow it . No way . You 're a total Indian giver . Come on , just loan me , like , fifty grand . All right , you two , you snooze , you lose ! Nobody gets the shrink ray now . Nice . Oh , this is unholy . I can actually see the stench in here . Hello , Doctor . Well , if it 's not Phantom Limb . In the flesh ... what there is of it . So , I heard you set the butterfly free . I just looked in the hole . It 's horrible ! Who told you that ? A little bird told me , but don 't blame Tiny Eagle . We all saw this coming . Well , it 's a complete lie . I could not be happier . This isn 't happening in here . It 's like two inches higher than the one at the cocoon . It 's throwing me all out of whack . We all know the good doctor ... could turn the world of professional villainy upside down ... if she would just try it on her own and drop ... Look , I 've got a good thing going on here . I 'm not the same person you used to know . OK , Pookums , that sound you heard was nothing , But some of the pressure has been released . You know , I 'm between hating scientists now . I could number two for you till you get on your feet . All right , why don 't you be a good little whatever-the-hell-you-are ... and run along ? This is not a good time . Wasn 't that Phantom Limb ? Didn 't you work with him or live near him or something ? I 've never met him before . He 's an ass . - How 'd it go in there ? - Oh , not well . It was all sound and fury signifying nothing . We have to find a real toilet ! What was that ? I just sold him a slice of the grinder . And what 's he gonna wash it down with ? That was the perfect opportunity to push the lemonade ! Do you know what this is ? This is profit . And do you know what that is ? A huge grinder ? A big hero ? No , that is there to make people spend $ 2.00 ... on a nickel 's worth of sugar water . Oh , I 'm going in the back to count receipts . Triana , take over for Dean . Here 's your hat . And I 'm gonna need your W-2 by the end of your shift . I 'm not wearing this . Create a diversion , and I 'll rush in . Just go in the woods . Fine . What do I do ? Come on , this place is a who 's who of villainy ... shopping for destroyer rays . It 's a powder keg . Improvise ! I sure would like this in khaki . Never mind , I 've got it . Hey , cool ! Girlie mags . No way ! It 's " Buffy 's " own Sarah Michelle Gellar ! Dick ! Bravo unit , this is team leader , C-C-C breach at Tip-Top Torpedoes and the Dollar Grab Bag Pavilion . Copy that , team leader . We have a similar situation over at Bargain Atomic Appliances . There . Was that hard ? Come on . I need backup over here ! One of these nancy-boy creeps ... thought it would be funny to test the merchandise . You 're all my witnesses ! Secret agent brutality ! Officer , I would like to press charges . You can 't spend all of the boss 's money on that . He 'll kill us ! Dude , have you gone insane ? We have to get this . I 'm gonna cry . I have been dreaming of this since I was three . - I 'm telling you ... - Dude , look at this , please . Oh , you like that , huh ? It 's a prototype . Couldn 't sell ' em . Yeah , Kenner wasn 't interested in a toy that cost over two mill in parts alone ... and the army told me they don 't sword fight anymore . I 'll take it , and I don 't need a bag . I 'm gonna wear this home . My friend , bedlam has broken out athwart the kingdom of Venture ! Join me in battle ! Oh , crap , Brock is never gonna let me hear the end of this . Back to back , neighbor ! We shall fight them as a team ! I 'm not going " back to back " with anybody . I 'm going inside . Very well ! Secure the homestead ! Your family must come first ! Honestly , what kind of jackass would leave every door unlocked ? I 'm not gonna flush . Let them see the wrath of the Monarch ! This is totally freaky . I 'm in my archenemy 's bedroom . We really should do something ... sinister ? I don 't know . Like what ? Want to do it on his bed ? You know ... make him sleep in our genetic filth ? Yeah , me neither . Oh , this isn 't working . I 'm not feeling it . Yeah , hey ... why don 't we find his lab and , uh , I don 't know , break something ... All right . This is ridiculous . You 're gonna get us all killed ! I quit . We are not going anywhere ! When I chose this neighborhood ... to open my first Hankco 's Lemonade and Grinder World ... I knew the consequences . All right , that 's it , I am out of here . When these riots are over , we are going to rebuild ! As God as my witness , I will not let my people down ... I am Dr. Orpheus ! That was delivered by Dr. Orpheus ! If any of you colorful rogues ... would like to take revenge out on me on a full-time basis ... my schedule is open ! You totally blew it out there . You are so right . I should have rescued her , or at least ... Or at least not run away crying . She 'll be fine , boys . Her father 's out there destroying my lawn with his magic . He wouldn 't let anything happen to her . Hey , Pop , did you leave the door to your lab open ? Brock Samson . At last we meet . No , my young Padawan learner . This one is mine . Do I know you ? I 've been gypped ! - Boo ! - Oh , my God ! He 's gonna so [ bleep ] pop me ! Brock , come in , Brock . - Yeah ? - There 's someone in the lab . - Who ? - I 'm not going in there ! I 'm sending a team over now . Oh , my God , look at this place . It 's like a museum of failure . It 's almost depressing . Here I am in the belly of the beast , and I don 't even care . I don 't even feel like taking a whiz on this . I used to dream of taking a whiz on this ! So , I guess we 're not gonna ... What can I do to this guy that life hasn 't already ? I almost feel sorry for him . A lot has changed . I was meaning to talk to you about things ... and us ... Oh , no , you don 't ! Take it easy ! Get down , honeybunch ! No one gets the drop on the Monarch ! With every fiber of my being , I stab at thee ! As long as blood flows through this heart ... I will hunt you down . I will be the stuff of your children 's nightmares ! What 's he doing now ? He 's making his dramatic exit . This could take all night . I 'm gonna get Brock . Oh , I think he 's almost done . And then when nothing can be heard but your cries of agony ... I will pull the chain and let the beast devour you ! Mark my words ! I will have my revenge , Dr. Venture ! There . All right , they 're finishing up . Let 's go home . That 's good soup !

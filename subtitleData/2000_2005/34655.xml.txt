What 's your status ? is SWAT here yet ? Secure your perimeter . - What are you waiting for ? - SWAT team . They 'll be all night . Take the stairs . We 've got smoke in here . It 's him . Go ! Don 't shoot , please ! - ls anybody else in there ? - No ! Get them downstairs ! Go ! - Get them out ! - Check it ! - We 've got to wait for the fire trucks . - Absolutely . Shit ! Get those windows open . Go on ! Come on ! Move it ! Come on , baby ! Go ! Come on , baby . I 'm okay . Get out of here ! What in hell are you doing ? It 's okay . Take the baby . Get him to the hospital . Make sure he 's okay . Suspect is a white male , heading north on Hauser on foot wearing a black leather coat . Hold it there ! Stop the bus ! Open up ! - What 's going on ? - Sorry , folks . Just a routine check . Nothing to be alarmed about . What 's going on ? Sorry for the inconvenience . Everybody up ! Against the window . Don 't look at me ! Freeze ! Be afraid , Jake . Be very afraid . Almost had him. I had him ! Well , that 's not your problem anymore . As of an hour ago , you 're officially retired . I know . When they find the car they should check for blood . Shut up , okay. lt 's not your case anymore . I popped him one . Check for blood . You just couldn 't leave quietly , huh ? You know , I wanted one last inspiring lecture from you . Ten years , you 've heard them all . A lot of good it 's done . But , before you go , the feds are here . They want to talk . To me ? Of course , they do . Gentlemen . - Stan Reisman . How are you ? - Fine . What do you want ? - l understand you 're leaving the force . - That 's right . - We 'd like to offer you a job . - No , thanks . Don 't need one . We can help you catch him . He will kill again . Last night , the Torch claimed his 11th victim . This elusive serial killer has remained at large for over three years , preying on mothers throughout the Seattle area . Detective Jake Riley who has headed up the case had this to say about the Torch . How 's it to be leaving with the Torch case unsolved ? No comment . - Has he called you ? - No comment . Is this brilliant killer the reason you 're quitting ? I 'm retiring for personal reasons . It 's got nothing to do with it . - Come on . Give us something . - I 'll give you something . Our big bad bogeyman is nothing more than a bed-wetting mama 's boy . That 's right . He pisses himself all the time . Pathetic really . Just a sick pervert . Is that enough for you ? - Did you get that ? - Did we get that ? Did you get that ? - Darling , telephone for you . - Oh , thanks , Mom . Yeah ? That was a nasty thing you said about me on TV . Oh , yeah ? You 're just a little too sensitive . I don 't want you calling me anymore . I 'm retired . You can quit , but you 'll never get rid of me . I 'm too smart . Yeah , Mommy must be proud of her little psycho . Stop it . Look at yourself . Three years trying to catch me . But you failed . You 're a bad cop . Do you think quitting would stop me ? I 'm going to keep on killing , asshole . - You 're a real loser . - Fuck you , you fucking prick ! I 'm gonna track you down like a fucking dog ! You understand , you son of a bitch ? Fuck youI Fuck you , too , Jake . It 's always the same M.O. with slight variations . Single mother . Mole . Burns them postmortem . We 've got partial prints . Trace evidence . Blood type , even . - But still no Torch . - No shit . Tell me something I don 't know . We fed enormous amounts of data on the Torch into our vicap supercomputer . We 've come up with a white male . Thirties . Very physical . Step up to the mark . Welcome , Jacob Riley . The Martucci slayings , a year ago . We found a hair follicle belonging to him . It was enough for a DNA imprint . Take a closer look . - Okay . So this is a clone of the killer ? - A replicant . God created man in six days . We took longer . - Since when is the FBl- - - We 're not fbi . We 're National Security Force . We really don 't care about your serial killer . Originally , this was developed for national security . Counter-terrorism . Today 's intelligence has failed to weed out terrorists . Okay . Go on . Our goal is to create replicants that can lead us to them . I understand . He 's not a terrorist , though . No . But the behaviour patterns are similar . So , why me ? Because he picked you . What do you mean he picked me ? When he 's ready you 'll take custody . You 'll care for him . Help him develop . Then you 'll see if he can lead you to the killer . Wouldn 't it be easier just to plaster his face on TV ? This project is classified . No pictures . No conventional techniques . All you have is Replicant . What 's going on ? A counter-reaction . He 's rejecting the latest growth hormone . - Talk to me . What can we do ? - V-fib ! Flatline ! Get him out . Now ! Welcome to my world . Motherfucker . Good morning , Number One . Time to wake up . Today , we 're going to cover the basics : How to sit stand , walk and stop . Now I 'm walking . I 'm sitting . I 'm standing . I 'm Miss Johnson . How are you ? Did you hurt yourself ? Maybe your golden boy 's retarded . Physical readings are normal , but the brain sign waves are low . We 've enhanced his telepathic ability through genome resequencing . He may be our first , but genetic memory has been scientifically proven . He just needs human stimuli . That 's the toilet . That 's where you come in : first human contact . Good try . Watch the video and try again . - impressive , isn 't he ? - He 's exceeding expectations . You guys are pretty happy with yourselves , aren 't you ? You have no idea what you 're getting into there . I 've seen what he 's able to do firsthand to 1 1 women . If this thing turns out to be anything like the original , we 're gonna regret it . At the end of the day , Replicant is disposable . Take it easy . Food . Eat ! I 'm Jake . You like that ? How about this ? How 's that ? Here , here . Okay . Here . Look at that . You like that ? Strong , huh ? Easy ! Take it easy ! Take it easy ! Back up ! Back ! Easy ! Back ! Now , sit ! Sit !

Give me your glasses . - Those are $ 500 sunglasses . - Yeah ? Look . Thank you . Do I get an owner 's manual on this guy , or what ? You do whatever it takes to awaken the killer inside . Here are your temporary NSF papers . And your gun . - Got it . - l want a report every 12 hours . Okay . Let 's go . Walk ! Sit . Sleeping killer . How sweet . We 've got company . Okay , freak-of-science . Let 's talk a little shop here , shall we ? What do you remember ? What do you remember ? Come on . Are you a killer ? You feel like killing ?

Here 's your chance . Do it . Do it . Do it . Drop the gun ! Drop the gun ! Three stooges to the rescue . Stay calm . Do not shoot the subject . Jake , tell him to back off ! Just shoot him . Kill him . - Goddamn it , Jake . - Okay , boys . Take it easy . Maybe if you put your guns down , he 'll do the same . That 's good . You deliberately jeopardised a classified project . We 're taking him back . Good riddance . He 's useless . - Very nice . - You broke my arm ! You shouldn 't have showed him the moves ! No ! Hurts , don 't it ? - Freeze ! - No ! Million-dollar project ! No shooting , remember ? Put it away ! That 's it . Put it away ! Stay ! No ! Stay ! Here . Sit . Stay . Good . I 'll call you a cab . Walk . Walk . Yeah , hi .

This house was built in 1926 . All the woodwork is original . A nice cosy fireplace here makes the entrance that much more special . Over here , we have a spacious living room . This way . Here , we go into the kitchen which has recently been remodelled . All the marble , of course , imported from Florence . And over here , we have the dining room . It 's perfect for entertaining . What line of work did you say you were in ? I was in law enforcement . That 's right . You 're that TV cop . The Torch case . I feel so much better . - You know the history of the house ? - Yes , I do . You know , it 's such a shame because most people can never get past it . But it is a steal .

What do you see ? - Has he been here before ? - ln another life . Let 's go . I don 't want to go home . I want to go to the park ! Now ! Johnny , stop it !

What happened ? I kicked the shit out of him . Honest mistake . It 's been 18 hours . You 've gone AWOL , let him attack my men and now you 're telling me you 've mistreated my replicant ? - Perhaps I made an error in judgment . - Perhaps you did . Perhaps you should take your experiment and go. I don 't need your shit . After what the Torch said to you , I thought you 'd really want to nail him . How do you know what he said to me ? You got my place wired , is that it ? How did you know where we were today ? You tracking us , too ? You think we 'd let you out with the future of our national security without knowing everything about you ? I expect a report every 12 hours .

 We 're in transit with an unconscious male ... condition stable , mid-forties ... temperature 105 , mental confusion . No apparent injuries ... but has a black rash on the chest and arms . Any available ER , please respond . " lnfection " Room five . He fell . He broke his right ankle . Don 't tell me the obvious . I can see that . Why did he fall ? Whose fault was it ? He tried to get out of bed . You must stay put . You can 't walk yet . I called out for help many times , but nobody came . I thought I 'd wet the bed . I 'm not avoiding you . I 'll send the cash next week , I promise . Please understand , it 's a tough time . No , I 'm not being cold . I do love our daughter . I think of her more than you . There you are , Dr. Uozumi . The boy with high fever is waiting to see you . is it my turn yet ? I 've been here forever . I told you , please be patient . is it my turn yet ? My head is spinning . Please respond . Male in his forties , pulse dropping ... temperature rising , rash spreading to his face . He 's in critical condition . Thank you very much . What the hell is going on ? They are late paying us again . I spoke with them this morning . And ? For Christ 's sake , you 're our representative . You 're being paid . It 's for a nurse . Where are they ? Room six , bed two . It 's your patient . Do I prioritize in or outpatients ? Both . I get it . Send them all to surgery . The hospital makes a fortune , and we can finally get paid ! Sorry . Please respond . His rash is spreading . His fever is out of control . It may affect his brain . He needs immediate care . Someone , please reply . It 's too hot in here . What is going on ? The generator is malfunctioning and unstable . Doctor ... We 're running out of our supplies . Blood bags , drips , syringes- - we only have a few of each left . As for drugs ... Can 't you order more ? Nine nurses have quit these past two weeks . It 's clear that our operation is in trouble . Everyone is avoiding us now . Let 's just do our best . is that your solution ? My nurses are working non-stop . Because we 're understaffed ... we put patients into shared rooms ... and we risk cross-infection . It needs to be discussed . Keys to the drug cabinet , please . You must force some patients home . Who ? Which ones ? For some of them that means- - l know ... better than anyone . Where does it hurt ? My chest--it really hurts . Can you bear it ? Can 't you help me ? It 's too late for surgery , huh ? Don 't say that . Be strong . There 's no hope . No drugs can help me either . No. lf we used stronger drugs ... we 'd be risking your life . I don 't mind . Please do it . If it will lessen the pain ... I don 't care what the odds are . Don 't be like that . Let 's be strong together . How long have you felt dizzy ? Maybe it 's nothing ... but I don 't remember . When I woke up- - Woke up ? Speak straight and stop smiling . I woke up face down . Did you hit your head ? Why didn 't we realize ? How long has he been here ? He didn 't tell us . Call Dr. Akiba now ! I 'm so sorry . Now you 're in a new room . When you call us , we can come right away . All right . Forget it . I haven 't taken care of the blood . You 're new . I shouldn 't have asked you . - l can do it . - Step aside . Do you have any idea what you 've done ? He 's not your guinea pig . If he were conscious , you 'd be in trouble . Practice on yourself , if you must . Come here . Quickly , everyone . Come here . Come in , please . The rash has covered his whole body . Respond immediately . How is he ? Concussion , right ? He walked here from the highway . Cerebral ventricle hemorrhage ... sub-cranial hematoma ... no voluntary respiration . It 's up to you . I 'll check on the outpatients . Come here , everyone . Grandpa , you , too . I 've made dinner . Grandma , don 't hide . Let 's eat , come on . Hold out your hands . Take her back to Dr. Nakazono in Neurology . What are you doing ? Suturing this cut . I can do it , a simple thing like that . Simple ? It 's a vital surgical skill ! But I 'm a surgeon , too ! How dare you ! I know of your work- - a failed pediatrician who begged us for work . Don 't call yourself a surgeon . Please let me do it . I can do sutures . Do you want to sew people up ? That 's the extent of your ambition . You don 't deserve to practice . Wake me up in three hours . I 'll take a nap in Room five . I can do it . It 's easy. I know I can . " No longer accepting new patients . " Any ER respond , please . The rash is spreading . It may be infectious . Pulse dropping , high fever . It 's an emergency . Please respond . Male in his forties , rash spreading . Central Hospital . - We have an emergency patient . - Can 't take him , sorry . He needs a well-equipped hospital . I understand , but- - He might be infectious . Try somewhere else . We can 't accept him . Can you pick up the glasses ? Do you recognize this ? You do , don 't you ? You 're all there . I 'm sorry . I should make dinner . Not an unusual case . It happens as the brain atrophies . You made dinner . I 'd love some . She sees her long-dead family . It 's a mystery why they appear there ... but the phenomenon itself is well-known . Ever wonder how come red is always the same color ? In the sunlight ... or beneath a lamp ... it looks the same , right ? That 's proof that our brains are creating the color . A lot of what we see is actually a product of our mental process . If brain circuitry is altered ... memories can begin to move again . You can let her look at mirrors ... just don 't let her have one . If it broke , it might upset her . I understand . She had cigarettes , you know . Probably from another patient . I 'll be in at 7 : 00 a.m. Working late ? Good-bye , then . Every damn day . I can do it . Sutures are easy . I 'm a fine surgeon . Who does he think he is ? Buying new equipment , but not hiring technicians ... leaving renovations half-done . What 's up with this hospital ? Don 't tell anyone ... but I haven 't heard from the director since yesterday . We have no reason to stay here ... but we can 't abandon the patients . Many of them can 't be transferred . They should be ... in hospice care . Let 's divide them up ... look for places that 'll take them . If ... we can just get through tonight . What ? Ask me before you use things ! I 'm so bad with a syringe . We don 't have enough ! Stop this . Chief , problem in Room Three . Room Three ? What are you doing ? I said no ! It 's urgent . He 's been in transit for an hour . We 're too short-staffed . He 's covered in a rash , maybe infectious . Exactly , so we- - He is in critical condition ! But we can 't quarantine him . Don 't you care what happens ? As a doctor , you don 't care if he dies ? Where is he ? Where 's he gone ? Down here . What happened ? He must 've fallen . - Call Dr. Akiba . - He 's Dr. Uozumi 's patient . - Get them both . - Right . Go back to your room . If he dies en route ... to somewhere else ... I have to report this hospital . OK , I get it . into our ER , emergency treatment only . That 's all we can do . Room Three , he 's deteriorating fast . Room Three ? It 's out of the question . Try elsewhere . Stop that ! - What 's up ? - Looks like he fell . - Fell ? Trying to stand ? - l don 't know . The hematoma is affecting his mental state . Weak pulse . Check blood pressure . What the hell ? What 's going on ? Blood pressure is below seventy . Dopamine drip ... five gamma units . What happened ? - Fell out of bed . - Fell ? You 're kidding ? Damn . Tachycardiac arrest . Defibrillator . Epinephrine , atropine , and calcium chloride . Get her out of here . Here 's the epinephrine . Come with me . 200 joules . Removing bandages . 200 joules , charged . Step back . - Damn . - Set it to 250 . Charged . No change . Steroids and that calcium . Shut her up ! - 250 joules charged . - Try 300 . Calcium chlorate . No pulse for five minutes , so- - So cardiac massage . Here ? 300 charged . - OK . - One moment . OK . There 's a pulse . What was that ? What a strange color ! What did you use ? You said calcium chlorate . Chlorate ? It 's chloride ! But he said- - - Get ready for surgery ! - Not here . Uozumi , think . Can we flush him ? No , his blood chemistry is ruined . - l 'll open him up . Scalpel . - Forget it. lt 's no use . Get ready . Forget it. lt 's all over . He 's gone . But- - But I heard " chlorate . " Forget it . What 's done is done . It 's my fault ? I killed him ? Stop it. lt 's too late now . Did I kill him ? But the doctor said " chlorate . " Quiet ! Don 't worry . I heard it , too . Dr. Akiba definitely said " chlorate . " Come on . We 're not assigning blame . There must be a report . Why ? What report ? Wait a minute . Nobody wanted him to die . It was a medical mistake . I don 't recall ... what I ordered . But ... the proof is right there . I take full responsibility . Wait a minute . His pulse was slack , failing . Even so , immediate cause of death was misdosage . Suppose we 'd found him later ? There 'd be no way of saving him . One moment , Dr. Uozumi . Are you asking us to falsify the report ? Why be a slave to the truth ? We did all we could for him for three months . A situation developed ... and things just turned for the worst . is that it ? It 's not like we injected Drano . In a life or death situation , it was a small mistake . Doctor , he was your patient . You were entrusted with his life . He had burns over seventy percent of his body . If he had returned to consciousness ... what kind of life would he have had ? - Doctor . - Stop it , please ! It 's my fault , and I 'll take the blame . If I 'd ... just stopped to think ... ln any case , I 'll do what must be done . What happens ... if Dr. Akiba has to quit ? As things are , if this place is reported ... what will become of the patients ? It doesn 't justify a false report . We 'll all lose our jobs . And what if it gets into the media ? It 'll follow all of us . We 'll be unemployable . Chief ... he never had ... a single visitor . No friends , no family ... no one . No one ... can recognize him , right ? As he decays ... the chemical will dissipate . The burns messed up his chemistry anyway . So no one could know ? If someone ran an analysis in the next 48 hours ... but who would doubt us if we all sign the certificate ? It won 't be family that picks him up . The Health Department will take him . There might be ... an official autopsy . Complete cell breakdown will take two days . We can 't wait that long . We must tell the authorities today . Let 's heat him up . Speed the decay . His skin was inflamed anyway . So he decayed faster . - lt 's perfect . - Here ? Rooms One and Five are free . Dr. Kishida is sleeping in Five . Kishida is in Five ? This is Room Three . Five is across from Room Four . Put him in Room One ... and warm him up . Four hours will do it . Erase the EKG memory . It 's OK . Don 't worry about her . Don 't let him decay too far . We 'll take turns . I 'll stay . Doctor ... I 'm sorry . I got so confused . Don 't worry about it . I 've always ... felt you were ... lt 's OK . Escaping gas makes them move . How long since you graduated ? Three months . You 're very behind . How old are you ? I 'm twenty-three . Why ? Did you drop out ? No . Let me keep trying . That 's no use . Nursing is an innate skill . " Trying " does nothing . It 's a good thing you 're at this hospital . Understand ? Nowhere else ... would you deserve to be called " Nurse . " See , I can do it . Whose patient is that ... in the ER ? ER ? No way . Where ? He was here . Dr. Akiba . Dr. Akiba . Doctor . Dr. Akai . Dr. Akiba . Who is this ? He has been left alone . I told the paramedics no , but- - Doctor , I thought you 'd gone home . I fell fast asleep ... in one of the wards . A ward ? Which one ? Where did you sleep ? Why ? - l should 've woken you . - Room Four . Room Four ? The patient with the brain contusion . I checked on him ... got sleepy , then crashed out . - Anything wrong ? - No . Young Akiba ... you didn 't examine him yet . I 'm anxious for you to see him . Right . A most unusual case . What on earth is that ? Liquefaction of the internal organs . He smiled ... right at me . Me , too . We must contact the Health Department . Akiba , wait . Think a moment . We 're the first doctors to see these symptoms . We could be pioneers . But if it 's infectious , think of the risk . Let 's call Disease Control . Really , Akiba ? You want them involved ? Ms. Shiozaki , call Uozumi . So , he fell from the bed . Unconscious though he was , he fell out of bed . Why do you think that was ? Because you hurt him . No . He tried to get away from you . That 's not true . You jabbed him so many times . That 's not right ! You heard everything in Room Three , right ? But make no mistake ... you were the one ... who caused his death . What the hell is that ? He looked right through me and smiled . Akiba , what do we do ? We study it . Study ? None of the texts contain anything like this decay . You want to spend your entire career here ? A once-in-a-lifetime chance . If we discover the pathogen ... it will carry our names ... forever . Offers and research grants will pour in . Let 's do it . Our secret . Let 's get started . Uozumi ! I hate this . I don 't care . I want no part of it . You can 't ask me to touch that . I feel the same , but we have no choice . Why ? He doesn 't run the hospital . He was in Room Four . Dr. Akai was next door . I don 't know what he heard . He says he was asleep . It 'll take three more hours in Room One . Let 's buy time . Then we can talk our way out of it . Are you decided ? Let 's get down to work . I want a cell culture . Nurse , I put him on a monitor . Keep an eye on him . Right . Dr. Akiba . Where are you ? You shouldn 't be here . Come out . Where are you hiding ? Come out . Dr. Kishida . Time to sleep . Come on . You 're ... still there ? What 's up ? She sneaked in . She likes it here . I 'm busy now . Check on Room One now and then , OK ? OK . You 're still there . You 're there , aren 't you ? Ms. Shiozaki . Nurse ? Nurse ! Where did he go ? - He dissolved . - No way . The gangrene just consumed him . Maybe he just escaped . With no muscle tissue ? I don 't think so . We must consider everything . That 's not enough tissue for one man . It 's not much , that 's for sure . Escaped . Let 's search . We 'll split up . Find something ? What a night . One thing after another . It could hardly be worse . Think we 'll find it ? is it crawling around somewhere ? It 's not medically possible- - No , it 's not . No musculature . It defies common sense , even . Hang on . Let 's take a step back . Did we really see it ? Do you ... really believe it ? What do you mean ? We were shocked , confused . We imagined a man 's face ... like seeing a face in the clouds ... We saw it ! We saw it . We saw the tissue damage . It was human . I don 't know if our emotions played tricks or what ... but a man dissolved before our very eyes . Excuse me . I 'm going back to work . I tell them , but they still throw them out . We 've got to save more of them . It 's such a waste . Nurse , they 're from the infectious patient . Nurse , what 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? Ms. Shiozaki ? If I just sterilize them ... we can refill the shelves , right ? Sister ? What happened ? Ms. Shiozaki , what are you doing ? Cold water , quick ! Look . The same--The same symptoms . As what ? It 's true . Got that ? It 's happening ! Get her out of here . We must contain it . - lt 's an airborne infection . - infection ? What do we do ? Uozumi ? - How about Room One ? - No . - Kishida is asleep in Room Five . - Where then ? In there is safest . Not with bare hands ! What 's wrong ? Something happened ? Don 't touch or even approach her . She 's got a fever . We must treat her . Forgive me . I 'm sorry . Forgive me . What we saw was human , after all . Now we know it 's strong enough to spread . What can we do ? We should hurry . Nurse Shiozaki 's internal organs are gone . What happened to her ? What on earth ? What 's going on , Doctor ? Please tell me what 's going on ? I can 't talk now . Later maybe , when Room One is cleared up . I have a right to know ! What infection ? Dr. Akai . What ? What happened ? It spread . Shiozaki has the symptoms . Can she still talk ? Talk ? Are you kidding ? ! Then she can 't be the pathogen host . Let 's find the other guy . What do you mean , " host " ? You saw what it did . Enough is enough . Let 's report it . It 's too far gone . Now it 's spreading . If you won 't , I 'll search myself ... starting in Room One . Wait . I 'll go check Room One . Nurse ? What the hell are you doing ? Stop messing around . I found the vein . Now I hit them on the first try . What are you doing ? Every vein in the body . Stop it . Stop ! Am I a slow learner ? Slow at everything ? That 's not why I dropped a school year . I had terrible asthma . Hospitalized for two years . The nurses were so kind to me . I wanted ... to be just like them . is that bad ? To want to be a nurse ? Even ... a slow girl like me ? I didn 't mean it like that . No innate skill ... so I stuck him ... over and over . Over ... and over ... - and over- - - l 'm sorry ! Please give me the syringe . You can 't take back ... what 's been said . Want me to practice ? Then I will . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry ! Time for practice . Don 't ! That was the young nurse . How on earth can you tell ? It 's the same symptoms . What symptoms ? Dr. Akai . We can 't handle an airborne pathogen this toxic . We don 't know it 's airborne . The contusion patient in Room Four is unaffected . Even worse . We 're clueless about it ... beyond knowing it kills and has no interest in symbiosis . Use your brains . You 'll only become country quacks at this rate . But it dissolves people . Why do that to a host ? What if it doesn 't need a host ? Cells live for a few hours after death . Imagine it uses this to restructure the body . Dr. Akai ... do you have any proof of that ? Why are you so concerned with the pathogen ? I told you--to be a pioneer . I 'm sick of this . The same symptoms . The same symptoms ? Let 's set a limit- - one more hour . If we don 't solve it in an hour , we call for help . They 'll only seal off the hospital . They won 't help us . No one exits until they identify it . We 'd just wait to die . Then I 'll leave now . You mean run ? - l don 't care how you put it . - Young man ... if you leave now , will you ever stop running ? We should all get our stories straight ... concerning ourselves . If you won 't regret it , go . It 's up to you . One hour . Then we report it ... and I 'm gone . Fine by me . I never liked this place . Wanted to quit anyway . - lt 's your choice . - Now I know why . Because of you . Finally you admit it . I already knew . But really it 's not my fault . You 're flawed ... as a doctor and as a human being . Therefore , you 'll never be a good doctor . No love for your patients . Visiting hours are over . Now is the only time ... I can make it . You 're caring for my son ... but I can 't find him . Which room ? It was Room Three . He was badly burned . He 's not in his usual bed . Where 's my son ? Your son- - A while ago ... his symptoms ... I 've not been to visit for ages . I 'd like to see him soon . Your son 's symptoms- - You can 't see him today . is that so ? I 'll come again tomorrow . Doctor . Doctor . it hurts . It hurts so much . Are you OK ? Fine . Just hungry . Do you want some ? A visitor left it for us . I 'm OK . I can 't bear it . Give me something . I can 't . Please stick it out . This will be you one day . Then you 'll know how it feels . They say we 're judged ... at the end of our days . So why are you punishing me now ? What are you talking about ? I can 't change anything . - You run away then . - No , I don 't . A doctor 's job is to extend life by every day he can . You should try ... having a little love for your patients . How dare you ? Love your patients . Love your patients . - Love them more . - Let me go ! Forgive me , please . Back then ... I spoke with your wife and daughter . They were worn out from nursing you , so l- - You couldn 't cure me ... so you wanted me out of the hospital . No , that 's not it . You didn 't react . I thought it was for the best . It was agony when my heart stopped . I always had faith ... you 'd cure me some day . I 'm so sorry . Please accept my apology . I don 't know what came over me . Uozumi ... what 's up ? Who are you talking to ? I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . Why ? Why not give this man drugs ? When you killed me so easily ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm at peace now . A doctor 's job ... isn 't just about preserving life . Release him from his pain . OK . Calm down . Uozumi , stop it ! Stop ! Are you OK ? What 's wrong ? But he- - He gets inside . He gets inside my head . lnside- - Inside my head . My head 's exploding . My head- - My head 's exploding . Help me . Help me . My head- - it hurts . Dr. Akai ! Dr. Akai ! What 's going on ? I 've got to get out of here now . You . Get out , quick . I 'm sorry for what I did . I polluted your blood . It was me . Have mine . I give it to you . - l was- - - Stop that ! I was bad . Doctor , join us . All together now . Join together . Naughty boy , come with us . Dr. Akai , get out of here . The infection is everywhere . We 're all doomed . Don 't worry . No one 's doomed . How come you 're so calm ? Do you know something ? What 's your secret ? What is this infection ? Did you spread the virus ? Vaccinated yourself ... to watch the infection spread ? I didn 't do that . Dr. Akiba . Think about how it spreads . What do you mean ? You forgot ? When you were all in Room Three ... I was nearby . I was very close , Akiba . I certainly wasn 't sleeping . I was wide awake . So what ? What 's that go to do with the infection ? Are you punishing us ? is that what you mean ? It was an accident . It was no one 's fault . I agree . His death couldn 't be helped . All of us die sometime . It 's what happened next . After that . You tried to make out that it didn 't happen . This virus isn 't airborne at all . It spreads through the mind . The mind ? Through dreams . Before you know it ... it 'll reach your subconscious , too . Don 't talk nonsense . You created it and wanted to experiment on others . You were biding your time . Our mistake gave you the chance . You 're insane . You 've no right to judge us . Who are you to criticize us ? Dr. Akiba . Doctor . Dr. Nakazono , you 're in danger . Get out . The infection is spreading . Run quick ! Doctor , who were you talking to ? Who ? Who were you chatting with ? It was Dr. Akai . Akai ? Look carefully . No one 's there . No one is there . Doctor , there 's no one there . Did you see ? There 's a terrible infection . People go crazy . Blood turns green . Wait . - lt 's a sickness--infectious . - Stay away from me ! Believe me . An ER patient forced on us , incredible symptoms . He turned green and just dissolved . It spread . Their blood turned green , they vomited and died . Murder at Central Hospital ! Quick , send help ! I must put him back . Quick , get him back . Akai ? No way . No way . It can 't be true ! Dr. Akai , there you are ... there all along . Who are you talking to ? Of course ... you can 't leave us yet . The virus spreads through your consciousness- - through your dreams . Before you know it ... it 'll reach you soon enough . - There 's no pulse . - Try 300 . It 's charged . Step back . - No pulse . - Damn . Calcium chloride . Calcium chloride here . No . Calcium chlorate . Right , calcium chlorate . Dr. Kishida . Pardon me , but it 's 7 : 00 a.m. Doctor , please wake up . Doctor . Doctor ? Did I ? No . Did I ? No ! No way ! Two doctors and four nurses ... were killed at this hospital last night . Police are looking to question employee Dr. Kiyokazu Akiba . He was last seen by this paramedic . He was very flustered ... didn 't even glance at the patient . Very strange behavior for a doctor . I shudder to think what he 'd just done . Thank God I didn 't leave my patient with him . Was this your patient ? - l don 't know . - But your name 's here . We must know his treatment . It 's obvious . Don 't unplug him , for Christ 's sake ! I 'm sorry . Dr. Akai ... are you still here ? Still here then . Just right here . Help me . Help me . Help me . Help me . Help me .

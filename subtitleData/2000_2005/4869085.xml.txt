 Your move . - That 's a bold move . - I live on the edge . Nice work , dumb ass . I 've given some thought to moving off the edge . Not an ideal location . - Might get a place in the middle . - Toast . Toast . Quiet . Shut up . I 'm , uh - I got words . I 'm saying this ... is an " ass-picious " day . We all know what day it is . Suspicious ? What day is it ? A glorious day for all the proud members of the allied planets . - Unification Day ! - Yeah , yeah . The end of the scumbag independents ... and the dawn of a new galaxy . - Yeah . - Captain . Just feel the need for another drink . What month is it ? Hey . You gonna drink to the Alliance with me ? Six years today ... the Alliance sent the browncoats runnin ' ... pissin ' their pants . You know , your coat is kind of a brownish color . It was on sale . You didn 't toast . I 'm thinkin ' you 're one of them independents . And I 'm thinking you weren 't burdened with an overabundance of schooling . So why don 't we just ignore each other till we go away ? The independents were a bunch of cowardly , inbred piss pots . Should 've been killed off of every world spinnin ' . Say that to my face . I said ... you 're a coward and a piss pot . Now , what are you gonna do about it ? Nothin ' . I just wanted you to face me so she could get behind you . Drunks are so cute . Oh . Jayne ? Hey , I didn 't fight in no war . Best o ' luck though . Fine . Let 's do this . Wash , we got some local color happening . Grand entrance would not go amiss . Is Jayne even awake ? Whoa , whoa . Ha-ha . Oh , ho-ho . There 's just an acre of you fellas , isn 't there ? This is why we lost , you know . Superior numbers . Thanks for the reenactment , sir . Hey , hey . Them ain 't " kosherized " rules . I 'm thinkin ' somebody needs to put you down , dog . - What do you think ? - I 'm thinkin ' we 'll rise again . Every man there go back inside ... or we will blow a new crater in this little moon . Damn yokels can 't even tell a transport ship ain 't got no guns on it . Blow a new crater in this moon . My thanks , Wash . Nice save , as always . - A pleasure . - And how are our passengers ? They 're fine . So , what happened ? Another terrible brawl ? - Oddly enough , there was . - Are you getting my wife into trouble ? Wha - I didn 't start it . - I just wanted a quiet drink . - Funny , sir ... how you always seem to find yourself in an Alliance-friendly bar come " U " Day ... - looking for a quiet drink . - See , this is another sign of your tragic space dementia ... all paranoid and crotchety - breaks the heart . - Did we at least make a contact ? - Ladies and menfolk , we have ourselves a job . Take us out of the world , Wash . Got us some crime to be done . ~ Take my love , take my land ~ ~ Take me where I cannot stand ~ ~ I don 't care , I 'm still free ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ Take me out to the black ~ ~ Tell them I ain 't comin 'back ~ ~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~ ~ You can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ There 's no place I can be ~ ~ Since I 've found serenity ~ ~ But you can 't take the sky from me ~ ~ River ? River , it 's okay . It 's me . You know who I am ? Simon . Were you dreaming ? - Did you dream about the academy ? - It 's not relevant . If you can talk about what happened there - I know it 's hard , but the more I know , the faster you 'll get better . This isn 't home ? No . No , we can 't go home . If we go home , they 'll just send you back to the academy . This is safe for now . We 're on a ship . Midbulk transport . Standard radion accelerator core ... class-code 03-K64 . - Firefly . - Well , that 's something . I can 't even remember all that . - Need a weave on that ? - It 's nothin ' . I expect that someone 's face feels differently . Well , they tell ya , never hit a man with a closed fist ... but it is , on occasion , hilarious . Hmm . I suppose so . So , the , uh - the fight didn 't ... draw any , um , any attention ? No feds . Just an honest brawl between folk . None of us want the Alliance on us , Doctor . That 's why you 're here . I thought I was here because you needed a medic . Well , not today . Mal . Bad . In Latin . - Shepherd Book . - Captain . - How 's the girl ? - Still a little whimsical in the brainpan . Seems calm enough though . - Mm-hmm . - That young man 's very brave . Yeah . He 's my hero . Gave up everything to free his sister from that place . Go from being a doctor on the central planets ... to hiding on the fringes of the system . There 's not many would do that . Suppose not . There 's not many would take him in either . - Why did you ? - Same reason I took you on board , Shepherd . I need the fare . There 's neither of us can pay a tenth of what your crew makes on one of your jobs . Are you referring to our perfectly legitimate business enterprises ? I 'm wondering why a man so anxious to fly under Alliance radar ... would house known fugitives . The Alliance had her in that institution for a purpose ... whatever it was , and they will want her back . You 're not overly fond of the boy , so why risk it ? Because it 's the right thing to do . Oh , would you look at this . - Kaylee . - I 'm beginning to wonder if you yourself ... know why you 're doing it . What about you , Shepherd ? How come you 're flying about with us brigands ? I mean , shouldn 't you be off bringing religiosity to the fuzzy-wuzzies or some such ? Oh , I got heathens aplenty right here . If I 'm your mission , Shepherd , best give it up . You 're welcome on my boat . God ain 't . Where in the hell 's that girl ? Do you want me to put it up ? - No , that 's okay . - You have such lovely hair . I 'm sure the doctor would agree . Who ? Simon ? No , he 's much too - I mean , I 'm just - Do you think it looks better up ? We can experiment . We might even get wild later and wash your face . You ever do this for your clients ? Very occasionally . Not all of them have enough hair to get a brush through . Have you ever had to service a really hideous client ... with boils and the like ? A Companion chooses her own clients . That 's guild law . But physical appearance doesn 't matter so terribly . You look for compatibility of spirit . There 's an energy about a person that 's difficult to hide . - You try to feel that - - And then you ... try to feel the energy of their credit account . It has a sort of aura . What did I say to you about barging into my shuttle ? That it was manly and impulsive ? Yes , precisely . Only the exact phrase I used was don 't . Well , you 're holding my mechanic in thrall , and , Kaylee , what 's going on in the engine room ? Were there monkeys ? Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose ? I had to rewire the grav thrust ... because somebody won 't replace that crappy compression coil . Get the place squared away . It 's dangerous in there , and I ain 't paying ' you to get your hair played at . We work before we play . - You 're servicing crew now ? - In your lonely , pathetic dreams . What do you want ? - We have a job . - Congratulations . This job wouldn 't be on a decently civilized planet ... where I could screen some respectable clients , perhaps ? " Respectable clients . " That seems a contradiction . Don 't start . There 's , um - We haven 't got a location yet . We 'll be landing on a skyplex in a bit . - Run by a fella called Niska . - Never heard of him . Well , I have , and while we 're there , you 'll stay confined to the ship . Is the petty criminal perchance ashamed to be riding with a Companion ? Niska has a very unlovely rep . He 's got work for me , fine . But I don 't - I 'm not sure you 'd be safe . Mal , if you 're being a gentleman , I may die of shock . Hmm . - Have you got time to do my hair ? - Out . Is fine . Crow , they can come in . Eh , Malcolm Reynolds is which ? I 'm Captain Reynolds . My first mate Zoe . This is Jayne . Very nice . I am Adelai Niska . You have seen Crow . He loves to stand at the door to say , " Boo . " We got word you might have a job for us . Yes ! Yes , an exciting job . A train ... has , uh , something I need . You have worked a train before ? - We did a few . - Are you going to ask me what it is I need ? As a rule , no . Yes . Good . You have reputation . " Malcolm Reynolds gets it done " is the talk . Well , glad to hear that . You know what is reputation ? Is people talking . Is gossip . Uh - I also have reputation . Not so pleasant , I think you know . Crow . Now , for you , my reputation is not from gossip . You see this man ? Uh , he does not do the job . I show you what I do with him ... and now my reputation for you is fact . Is solid . You do the train job for me . Then you are solid . - No more gossip . - Right . Ooh . You do not like I kill this man . - Hmm . - Oh , no . I 'm sure he was a ... very bad person . My wife 's nephew . At dinner I 'm getting earful . There is no way out of that . So - Oh ! The train job . Come in . Here , in fifth car , two boxes . Alliance goods . You don 't mind taking from Alliance , I think . From your reputation ? You get on train at Hancock , headed for Paradiso . You take boxes off before you reach Paradiso ... and deliver to Crow ... here . Half money now . Crow give you other half at rendezvous point . Anything goes wrong , then your reputation only gossip ... and things between us ... not so solid . Yes ? - How long till we hit Paradiso ? - Another 20 minutes . We should be in the foothills in five . Let 's get to work . He 's a psycho , you know . Niska . He 's not the first psycho to hire us . Nor the last . You think that 's a commentary on us ? I just have an image in my head of a guy hanging from the ceiling . I got an image of it not being me . Let 's do the thing . Hi . Shepherd . Good day . So ... how do you think it 's going ? The caper ? Mal knows what he 's doing . How long have you known him ? I 've been on this ship eight months now . I 'm not certain I 'll ever actually know the captain . I 'm surprised a respectable Companion would sail with this crew . It 's not always this sort of work . They take the jobs they can get , even legitimate ones . But the further you get away from the central planets , the harder things are ... so this is part of it . I wish I could help . I mean , I don 't wanna help - Not help help , but - Not with the thieving , but - I do feel awfully useless . You could always pray they make it back safely . I don 't think the captain would much like me praying for him . Don 't tell him . I never do . Go on straight through . Keep moving . Sir , is there some information we might maybe be lacking ... as to why there 's an entire fed squad sitting on this train ? - Doesn 't concern us . - It kind of concerns me . I mean , they 're not protecting the goods . If they were , they wouldn 't be letting people past them . - You don 't think that changes the situation a bit ? - I surely do . Makes it more fun . Sir , I think you have a problem with your brain being missing . Come on . We stick to the plan . We get the goods . We 're back on Serenity before the train even reaches Paradiso . Only now we do it under the noses of 20 trained Alliance feds . And that makes them look all manner of stupid . Hell , this job I would pull for free . - Then can I have your share ? - No . - If you die , can I have your share ? - Yes . - Hey . - Oh . Hey , Doctor . You really should just call me Simon . Oh , I 'll do that then . So ... what are we doing ? - Oh , crime . - Crime . Good . Okay . Crime . It 's a train heist . See , we fly over the train car . The captain and Zoe sneak in . We lower Jayne onto the car ... and they bundle up the booty , and we haul ' em all back up . Easy as lying ' . - So you 've done this before . - Hell , no . But I think it 's gonna work . The captain when it comes to plans . Uh , is - You know , is there anything I can - something I should be doing ? Staying the hell out of everyone 's way . - No call to be snappy , Jayne . - Are you about to jump onto a moving train ? - Captain ain 't around . I 'm in charge . - Since when ? Just ' cause Mal says you 're medic don 't make you part of the crew . You just play at figuring ' what 's wrong ... with that moon-brained sister of yours till we call for you . Dong ma ? Right . You shouldn 't be so rude to him . - Why ? ' Cause he 's all rich and " fancible " ? - He 's not rich . The Alliance crashed his accounts when he snuck out his sister . Yeah , well , we could all be rich if we handed her back . You 're not even thinking that . - Mal is . - That 's not funny . He ain 't stupid . Why would he take on trouble like those two if there weren 't no profit in it , hmm ? Captain 's got a move he ain 't made yet . You 'll see . Time for some thrilling heroics . Niska 's sources better be good . Shining . Find the cargo . All hail the great Alliance . Fifteen seconds . Go ! Go ! Go now ! Come on . - Aaah ! God ! - Where are the others ? - They shot my gorram leg ! - Jayne . Are they still on the train ? Are they gonna be okay ? Everybody off ! . Come on , come on . Everybody off ! . This way . Move it . Our man didn 't get a look . Well , geez . Can someone find out what they took ? Randy . Keep those people together . Quiet ' em down . It was the medicine , sir . All of the supplies . They stole the gorram medicine ? We 've been waitin ' . All of it ? Every ounce . It 's all right . Oh , God help us . Son of a bitch . - What 's the fuss ? - All-network alert . Cargo theft . Medical shipment lifted off a train in the Georgia system en route to Paradiso . Six crates of Pescaline " D " . Right . That 'll get you a tidy fortune on the black market . Tag it received , bounce it back . Locals can deal with it . Sir , there is a regiment holding in Paradiso . They were on the train headed to the installation . Then get them back on the train and get it moving . Who 's holding them there ? - The sheriff requested a few to help him investigate - - These are federal marshals ... not local narcotic hounds . They 've got better things to do ... and so do we . Gorrammit , let 's get us movin ' . Now , I 'm not - I 'm not finished . - Why you got us parked here ? This ain 't the rendezvous spot . - It is now . Niska 's people are waitin ' . They 're not partial to waiting ' . Let ' em read a magazine . We don 't make the sale until Mal and Zoe are back . These are stone killers . They ain 't cuddly like me . I 'm not flying anywhere without my wife . She 'll be okay . She 's with the captain . There . You see ? Everybody wins . Aaah ! Doc , I need a pop to quiet this pain some . All right , but what about the authorities ? We 're sitting here with stolen Alliance goods . - Won 't they be looking for us ? - If they buzz this canyon , we 'll hear ' em before they see us . - I figure we 're good for a - - They won 't stop . They 'll never stop . They 'll just keep coming until they get back what you took . Two by two . Hands of blue . Two by two . Hands of blue . How 's about you shut that crazy mouth ! Is that a fun game ? Now , I 'm in charge here , and I 'm tellin ' you how it works . We don 't get the goods to Niska on time , he 'll make meat pies outta the lot of us ! - I ain 't walking ' into that . - This Adelai Niska you 're talkin ' about ? Now , how would a shepherd know a name like that ? As I 've heard it , he made a deal with the captain . If the captain 's not there to finish it ... if Niska finds out he 's being held ... and may speak as to who hired him ... I think we 're better off being a little late . - This is a nightmare . - Nothing points to us yet , sir . That ain 't what I 'm talkin ' about . Whatever happens , remember I love you . - Sir ? - Because you 're my wife . Right ... sir . Honey . Car three , row 12 . Mr. and Mrs. Raymond . Can you tell us what 's going on ? We 've been here for so long . - Did someone on the train get killed ? - No , no , no , no . Nothin ' like that . Uh - Says there your fare 's paid for by a third party ? My uncle . It was a wedding gift . Wedding gift . Spending your honeymoon in Paradiso ? Actually , we 're here looking for work . - That right ? - My uncle said ... he knew a Joey Bloggs out here , said he might have an opening . - Thought we 'd try our luck . - You a miner by trade ? Either of you ? - Not really . - Hmm . Haven 't seen many folk choose this life weren 't born to it . Well , work is real scarce for a couple just startin ' out . How come there 's so many sick here ? Bowden 's malady . Know what that is ? Affliction of the bone and muscle . Degenerative . Very . Every planet that 's been terra-formed for human life ... has its own little quirks . Turns out the , uh , air down underground ... mixed up with the ore processors - Perfect recipe for Bowden 's . Everybody gets it . Miners , dumpers . Hell , I got it . I ain 't ever set foot in a mine . But it 's treatable . There 's medicine . Pescaline . At least you can live like a person , you get it regular ... but our shipment got stole right off the train you was ridin 'in . Which is why you won 't be seein ' a parade in town today . Stolen . Well , didn 't I see an entire regiment ... of fine , young Alliance federals on the train ? You did . Same regiment let their medicine get swiped right out from under their noses ... then took off for their own camp without so much as a whoopsy-daisy . That sounds like the Alliance . Unite all the planets under one rule ... so that everybody can be interfered with or ignored equally . Alliance ain 't much use to us out here on the border planets ... but ... they ain 't the ones who stole the medicine . I ever find those people ... they ain 't ever gonna see the inside of a jail . I 'm just gonna toss ' em in a mine ... let ' em breathe deep for the rest of their lives . - Can 't argue with that . - Hmm . You mind tellin ' me , uh , when it was ... you last spoke toJoey Bloggs ? - Never did myself . - Right . Your uncle . Now , it was indicated to you that , uh , Joey had an opening ? Any job would do . That 's funny your uncle never went to mentioning the Bowden 's problem ... or that Joey Bloggs ... ate his own gun about eight months back . - Did he ? - Yep . Blew the back of his head right off . So ... would his job be open ? That 's it . We waited long enough . - Let 's get this bird in the air . - No rutting way . - You should sit down . - We can 't leave the captain and Zoe . They ain 't comin ' , we can 't get ' em , so they 're done . Let 's fire it up . - What 's going on ? - We 're takin ' off . - We 're not . - Captain 'd do the same if it were us . Not in a million years ! - Listen to me . - You know what the chain of command is ? It 's a chain I beat you with till you understand who 's in command here . Now , we 're finishing this deal ... and then maybe , maybe we 'll come back for those morons ... got themselves caught . You can 't change that by gettin ' all ... " bendy . " All what ? You got the - the light from the console ... to keep you - lift you up . Oh , they shine like ... little angels . Did he just go crazy and fall asleep ? I told him to sit down . You doped him . It was supposed to kick in a good deal sooner . I - I just didn 't feel comfortable with him in charge . I hope that 's all right . So , how do we get the others ? Jayne was right about them not making contact . Chances are they got pinched gettin 'off that train . We can 't just waltz in and pull ' em out . Someone respectable enough might be able to . - What the hell - - Don 't you dare speak to me ! Sheriff , I want this man bound by law at once . That 's assuming he hasn 't been already . No one 's been bound . Not yet . Thank God you stopped them . Did you honestly think you could access my accounts and I wouldn 't find you ? And , Zoe , what would your husband say if he knew you were here ? I - I was weak . So I take it they ain 't newlyweds . Hardly . Malcolm 's my indentured man with three years left in his debt . I imagine we 'll have to add another six months after this little adventure . Pardon them . Don 't think a one of 'em 's ever seen a registered Companion before . I apologize for my manner . - Not a bit . - Should I contact my ship ? Do you need to hold them very much longer ? Looks to me like we 're about done here . We had some , uh , unrelated trouble . - His story had kind of an odor to it . - Yes . It 's not the only thing about him that does . Thank you very much , Sheriff . Come along . That 's a hell of a lady . Her files were all in order ? I ran ' em twice . Huh . Let 's get started with the rest then . Hey . How 'd it go ? She hit me . We tried to get him into the infirmary . He 's just heavy . - Kept the engine running . We 're good to go . - We 're not going . Not - What ? Not - Why ? - We 're bringing the cargo back . - What ? What do you mean , " back " ? I waited for you guys ! What are you talking about ? What about Niska ? Won 't this put him in more or less a killing mood ? There 's others need this more . - Let 's get it on the mule . - My shuttle 's faster . You risked enough flying in there once . And I don 't want to get slapped no more . Far as Niska goes , we 'll explain to him ... the job went south when we return the money . You wanna explain , now 's your chance . You didn 't make the rendezvous . Ran into a few complications . You are thinking of taking Mr. Niska 's money ... and his property maybe . - Uh , interestingly , neither . - I don 't understand . Yeah . Look . Here 's what it is . Deal 's off . We changed our minds . You entered into an arrangement with Mr. Niska . - There is no mind changing . - I 'm afraid that 's where you 're wrong . We - We just - We can 't take this job . So you just relax . We 'll get you the money Niska gave us , you return it , and we 'll call it even . There is no even . Is that right ? Nice shot . I was aimin ' for his head . We 'll have to drag ' em from here . We can leave ' em just off the street . Notify the sheriff once we 're in deep , deep space . Why not tell him in person ? Got word of a ship not far out . Came lookin ' . Didn 't expect to find you comin ' back . Didn 't expect to be comin ' . Nothin ' missin ' . You were truthful back in town . These are tough times . A man can get a job . He might not look too close at what that job is . But a man learns all the details of a situation like ours ... well ... then he has a choice . I don 't believe he does . Let 's get these crates back to town , make ourselves useful . - Now , this is all the money Niska gave us in advance . - You bring it back to him . Tell him the job didn 't work out . We 're not thieves . But we are thieves . Point is , we 're not taking what 's his . We 'll stay out of his way as best we can from here on in . You explain that 's best for everyone . Okay ? Keep the money . Use it to buy a funeral . It doesn 't matter where you go or how far you fly . I will hunt you down , and the last thing you see will be my blade . Darn . - This is all the money Niska gave us - - I get it . I 'm good . Best thing for everyone . I 'm right there with you . You should 've let me do this sooner . I 've had plenty worse . It 's just - Ow ! - Sorry . - Just be careful . Pretty fast thinkin ' , doping ' up Jayne . Can 't say you made a lifetime friend . I 'll deal with him . Yeah , I 'm not too worried about you . - How 's your sister ? - The same . One moment she seems perfectly cogent , the next ... she speaks nonsense . It 's like a child . - So difficult to diagnose . - Two by two . I still don 't know what the government was trying to do with her . - Hands of blue . - So I have no idea if they succeeded . Two by two . Hands of blue . Two by two . Hands of blue . - Sorry to keep you waiting . There 's always one crisis - - We 're not interested . We 're here about a theft . The medicine . On that planet . - Word came up that was returned . - We didn 't fly ... 86 million miles to track down a box of Band-Aids , Colonel . We 're looking for a girl . This girl . Grr ! Arrgh !

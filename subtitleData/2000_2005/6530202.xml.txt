 Mr. Maleeni . Hey , guy . You ready to rumble ? If by " rumble " you mean perform , yes , I am . Cool . You know how he said you get 125 for the day ? It 's gonna be 75 instead . The gate 's for crap . But , hey , the show 's gotta go on , right ? - This will be my greatest show ever . - Right on . Ladies and gentlemen , damas y caballeros , I aim today not just to entertain but to educate , to instruct and inform in the venerable ... - And ancient history of my art . UntilJohann Nepomuk Hofsinzer ... called playing cards the poetry of magic , a conjuror 's skill was determined entirely by his ability ... to perform one effect . That effect was known as the cups and balls . The games were known for hundreds , if not thousands of years . Perhaps the greatest performer was the Italian Bartolomeo Bosco . Get on with it . Bosco 's passes with the cups and balls . Wah-day ... chubio ... colerader . Three gone ... and yet three ... return . Bosco had only one contemporary rival , a slightly older Frenchman named Conus , who announced in 1795 ... that he would make his wife , who was five-foot seven , appear under one of the cups . Practice though I have , I have been unable even to get married . Conus placed one ball in his pocket . He put the second ball away . Putting the third ball in his hand , he made it vanish , and that 's the mystery ... of the cups and the balls . Yo ! Can 't you do anything that ain 't a hundred years old ? That ain 't old school , that 's decrepit . Young man , shall I come heckle you on your job ? Make sure you count out the requisite number of McNuggets ? Show me somethin ' . Come on . Show me somethin ' . A callow challenge to be met by experience and skill . To wit , the Egyptian Dedi , whose most celebrated feat ... was to reattach a recently severed head , reuniting it with the still-warm body ... and no harm done . Western history knows ... three previous attempts at recreating ... this Noachian feat , each of the three ending in tragedy . This will be the fourth . May I have complete silence , please ? - Yeah ! Senor Maleeni ! Ho ho ! Folks , let 's give it up for the Amazing Maleeni . Guy , you rock . That kicked ass . I mean , it looked completely real . How did you do that ? Oh , yeah , right . Magic . Oh , hey , your money . Hold up . Two , four , fifty , fifty-five , sixty , sixty-five , seventy , seventy-five . You earned it . Mr. Maleeni ? Mr. Maleeni . Oh , God ! Oh ... Whew . - Neat trick , huh ? - I can think of a neater one ... how you convinced me to drop everything and get on the first plane to Los Angeles . Come on , Scully . This isn 't intriguing enough for you ? A magician turns his head completely around , 360 degrees , to the delight of young and old alike , after which it plops unceremoniously onto the pier . - See the picture ? - Yeah , I saw the picture . And as for this Amazing Maleeni turning his head all the way around ... Like you said , Mulder , neat trick . - But ? - But ... I 'd guess this event ... was completely removed from his subsequent murder . - You think this was a murder ? - Don 't you ? Mulder , his head was cut off . Ah . Observe the nearly complete absence of blood . Observe the paucity of fingerprints , as evidenced by the L.A.P.D. ' s liberal use ... - Of lycopodium powder . - Why are you talking like Tony Randall ? Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive one moment and expired the next . Know also that no one saw his fleeing attacker , nor heard the dying man 's cries . Mulder , I admit that I don 't know how it happened , but I still say that it was a murder . - So what 's your theory ? - A magic trick gone horribly wrong . One that claims the lives of all who attempt it . Can I see that camcorder again ? Thank you . A tourist videotaped ... Maleeni 's performance . This ... That ain 't old school , that 's decrepit . - Show me somethin ' . - Who 's the heckler ? Come on . Show me somethin ' . I don 't know . Neat trick , huh ? Hang on a second . Let me see this . That heckler 's pretty hard to impress , wouldn 't you say ? Look at him . He just takes off in a huff . - You think he 's a murderer ? - It 's worth checking out , don 't you think ? I don 't know . That 'd be a neat trick in itself . You never see his face . Ah ! But observe . His discarded soda cup . The hand may be quicker than the eye , but it still leaves fingerprints . - Provided they haven 't dumped the trash . - Skeptic . Mr. LaBonge ? We 're agents Mulder and Scully from the F.B.I. Were you at the Santa Monica Pier yesterday morning ? Yeah . You attended a magic show , the Amazing Maleeni ? Yeah , he sucks . Why ? He 's dead , under extremely suspicious circumstances . He still sucks . - How 'd you find me ? - Your fingerprints . - You have a criminal record . - A conviction for pickpocketing . Man , that was performance art . Besides , it 's ancient history . What are you saying ? You think I killed him ? Well , you 're on videotape heckling the deceased . What did you have against Mr. Maleeni ? First of all , his name 's not Maleeni . That 's the name of a real magician , a guy at the turn of the century , Max Malini . - Ever hear of him ? - No . It 's too bad . You should 've . Anyway , he steals his name , spells it a little differently ... and he does some tired crap that wouldn 't cut it at a kid 's birthday party . What about the trick where he turns his head completely around ? Check it out . No problem . Did you like that ? - Yeah . - Watch . A coin in the hand ... blows away . Maybe it 's a little bit hard for you to see . Let me make that ... bigger for you . Great , but I don 't see how they 're any different or better than the ones Maleeni did . Mozart and Salieri . They sound pretty much the same to a layman . But they ain 't . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? It 's about originality . Style . And more than anything else ... soul . Because that 's what separates the great ones ... from the hacks . We can 't do this halfway . We 're dealing with powerful forces at work here . Energies far beyond our mere ... mortal ... understanding . Enough to make a magician lose his head ? Could be . That , and I hear Maleeni racked up some pretty big gambling debts . Who knows who he might 've pissed off . Thank you , Mr. LaBonge . We 'll , uh , be in touch . Please do . Oh , and agents ? Mozart and Salieri . Which one 's which ? Mulder , I think that professional jealousy ... is as good a motive for murder as any . If it was a murder . I 'm not convinced . If I can get Mr. Maleeni into an autopsy bay , hopefully we can put this issue to rest as soon as possible . All right , I 'm stumped . I think I 'm supposed to be . - What do you think ? - Well , first of all , I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but Mr. Maleeni 's head ... didn 't just magically fall off . It was very carefully sawed . Very slow and exacting work , probably with a fine-tooth meat saw . And check out this little detail . Spirit gum , Mulder . It held the head to the body . - Just barely , of course . - So he was murdered ? Well , no . As far as I can tell , this man died of advanced coronary disease . - Natural causes . - Yeah . So basically , he died of a heart attack , somebody crept up behind him , sawed his head off ... and then glued it back on all in the space of 30 seconds . - Does that make sense to you ? - No . Which makes it even stranger still , because as far as I can tell ... this body has been dead for over a month . I see signs of refrigeration . And yet he performed yesterday . - What a trouper . - Well , somebody performed yesterday . Cissy Alvarez . Who are you ? You don 't remember me . Ain 't that a bitch ? My name 's LaBonge . I did time with you about eight years ago . - You were in for bank robbery . - The name doesn 't mean anything . What do you want ? I hear you 're a poker player . You won big off a guy who calls himself the Amazing Maleeni . Also goes by the name of Herman Pinchbeck . - Pinchbeck ? - He 's dead . Yeah , I saw in the paper . Something about his head fell off . Yeah . What 's it to you ? I 'm the guy that made his head fall off . You took his marker , right ? What 'd he owe you , 15 grand ? - Twenty . - I don 't think he was ever gonna pay you back . You want to cut to the chase ? You know , get a little more of your story out before we stomp you to death ? How would you like to get back what you 're owed times ten ? 200,000 . Mm . How ? - Helping me . - Do what ? Magic . Wanna hear more ? Excuse me . I 'm looking for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck . - He 's the gentleman right over there . The poor man . - Ah . - He look familiar to you , Scully ? - He certainly does . - The plot thickens . - He might try and run . Come in . - Good morning , Mr. And Mrs ... - Agents Mulder and Scully , F.B.I. You 're not here for a home loan , I take it . No . We are investigating the death of a magician ... who called himself the Amazing Maleeni . Herman Pinchbeck , my twin brother . Yes , we know . We checked his next of kin . - What happened to your neck , Mr. Pinchbeck ? - I was in a car accident . Car accident . So your injured neck has nothing to do with a magic trick ... you performed at the Santa Monica Pier two days ago , one which involved you turning your head around 360 degrees ? Well , no . That wasn 't me . I was in a bad car accident in Mexico . A bad Mexican car accident in Mexico . - Do you know magic , Mr. Pinchbeck ? - Yes , I do . Back in the ' 70s , my brother and I performed together . - Why 'd you stop ? - You never really stop . Pick a card , any card ? Hmm . - Very impressive . - My brother and I both wanted to do ... the absolute best magic the world had ever seen . The difference was , I knew we 'd never get there , but he always believed we would . We didn 't talk much after I quit the act . I have a theory , Mr. Pinchbeck , and I 'm gonna tell you how it goes . I think that your brother Herman died of heart disease ... having never made it as the world 's greatest magician . I think that hurt you , just as your estrangement from him hurt you . I think what you did was perform his last act for him . One last act for which he 'd always be remembered . One last act that would end with such a shock , such a denouement , as would be forever remembered in the annals of magic . That 's what I think . I so wish that were true . It was a very bad car accident in Mexico . - Oy ! - No kidding . What now ? A guy 's head falls off , it 's the greatest trick in the world . When there 's no discernible point to it , what 's the reason for doing that in the first place ? Well , why do people do magic ? To impress , to delight , to gain attention . Well , this one 's gaining mostly police attention . Maybe that 's the point . Well , maybe we should consult an expert ... someone who knows magic , who 's seen the greatest trick in the world . Maybe he can help us figure that out . - Mozart . - Yeah . What 's in it for me ? I mean , let 's say I help you out . What do I get in return ? The feeling of pride that comes from performing your civic duty ? How ' bout the chance ... to root through the professional secrets of your least favorite magician ? Good for a laugh , I guess . Man , it 's worse than I thought . You gotta feed those things , you know . So ... - Maleeni wasn 't murdered . - It would seem not . So someone impersonated him and his crappy act . It 's impressive . I 'd say the twin brother did it , but I don 't think ... he 's any better a magician than Maleeni was . There 's that , and he 's got no legs . Yeah . Whatever . Anyway , we 're looking for a magician with the same height and build . A good makeup job and the right wig , and no one would know the difference . Not even you , I guess . I had a couple of Jell-O shots in me . Hey , how did this impersonator switch out the dead body ? With ease . You 're gonna kick yourselves when I show you how he did this , it 's so simple . Because magic is all about ... misdirection . Your impersonator simply made sure everyone was looking the other way ... when he pulled Maleeni 's body from its secret hiding place ... underneath ... the floor . Man , this guy 's good . Well , thanks for your expert opinion . I guess we 're right back where we started . Maybe not . You said that , uh , the Amazing Maleeni had some gambling debts ? Yeah , that 's what I heard . Check this out . Looks like a marker . $ 20,000 . Pinchbeck . What would this be doing in Maleeni 's van ? Thank you , Mr. Pinchbeck . If you could sign here for me . With pleasure . - Anthony , what kind of gun is that ? - Glock 17 , .9 millimeter . I 've been thinking of maybe buying one since my accident . Well , here . Take a look . Hmm . Gosh , it 's heavier than I would 've thought . Thank you , Anthony , Marvin . If you ever want , I 'll take you to the shooting range . - Hmm . - Have a good one , Mr. Pinchbeck . You too . Hello , may I help you ? - Damn , you look just like him . - I 'm sorry ? Your no-good , malapaga brother ... died owing me money ... a lot of money . - You 're gonna make good . - I 'm sorry , but my , uh , brother 's debts are his own . I said , you 're gonna make good , 'cause me and my friends , we know where you live . - That sound like the rear diff ? - Pull over . Stay here and call it in . I 'll check it out . We got a problem with the rear diff . We 're on Fourth and Main . Checking it out is Anthony . You ! In the truck ! Get up where I can see you . Hands where I can see them ! Up ! Hands up . All right . Get out . Mister , get out ... Hey , I got a guy down back here ! It was a guy with tattoos ! I shot him four times ! I don 't understand . He was right here . It 's your handwriting , is it not ? Mr. Alvarez , please answer the question . That ain 't mine . I don 't know where you got that . It 's interesting . Yours are the only fingerprints on it . We ran it through the California Criminal History Database , to which you seem to be quite well known . So it 's my marker . So Pinchbeck owed me money . It was a friendly game of poker . Very friendly . $ 20,000 friendly . - Where did you find that ? - In Herman Pinchbeck 's van . Where were you last Thursday ? Here . All day . Ask ' em . What is it you think I did to Pinchbeck , huh ? What 's in it for me ? If I kill him , he ain 't gonna pay me . Why did you play with him in the first place ? You knew he was a professional magician . I didn 't know what he was . And he sure as hell couldn 't play worth a damn . Don 't leave town , Mr. Alvarez . Don 't you find it odd that the Amazing Maleeni 's a lousy poker player ? - This is a guy who 's adept at manipulating cards . - Maybe he wasn 't so adept . - LaBonge certainly doesn 't have a high opinion of his skills . - There 's another possibility . Behold ... an ordinary household quarter . I 'm going to take the quarter from my right hand and place it into my left hand . - Where is it ? - It 's in your right hand . No , no , no . Ahh-ahh ! - That 's not bad . Mulder ... - Blow your nose , Scully . - Blow your nose . Come on . Blow . - Achoo . - Ta-da ! Look at that . The Great Muldeeni . - Amazing ! - What 's the point ? - Misdirection . It 's the heart of magic , like LaBonge said . I made you look in one direction , the quarter went in the other . That 's what you think 's happening in this case ? I think we 're being led around by our noses . - By whom ? Maleeni 's already dead . - It certainly would appear so . But then again , you thought the quarter was in the right hand . 911 emergency . - Yeah , hello ? Yeah , I want to report a man with a gun . He 's threatening to kill somebody . - Can you please speak up ? - No , I can 't speak up . No , I can 't ! Sir ? Hello ? Hello ? Son of a bitch . Hey , partner . Hey , guys . - You son of a bitch . - I 'm sorry ? You tried to frame me . - I didn 't ! - Oh , you didn 't , huh ? - Wait ! We 've got a deal ! - We got no deal . I 'm gonna bleed you , you little bitch . - Back off . - You 're dead . Freeze ! Drop your weapon . Hands behind your head . Do it ! Put your hand down . Spread your legs . Agents . An unexpected surprise . - Good afternoon . - We 'd like to have a word with you , Mr. Pinchbeck . - I 'm fairly busy , actually . - I 'll bet . - Hey ! What ? - Let 's take a little spin , shall we ? - What 's this all about ? - It 's about misdirection , Mr. Pinchbeck . Or should I say the Amazing Maleeni ? Mulder ! It 's a trick , Scully . Voila . Had you fooled . - You 're Maleeni ? - Call me Herman . I was afraid for my life . That 's why I did what I did . I 'm not proud of that . But I owe a lot of money that I can 't possibly pay back . We know ... gambling debts to a man named Alvarez . Yeah , that tattooed psychopath . I 've since heard terrible stories about him , things he did in prison to fellow inmates . - So why 'd you play poker with him ? - He runs a good game . I gamble to supplement my income . God knows , magic barely pays . Why did you lose ? You could 've manipulated the cards , right ? Cheat ? You 're asking why I don 't cheat at cards ? - Well , you could , right ? - Of course , I could . But how would I live with myself ? Who raised you ? Well , sir , what does any of this have to do with your twin brother ... being found decapitated at the Santa Monica Pier ? I went to my brother for a loan . Just my luck and his . You found him dead of a heart attack . His body was still warm . Looking at him lifeless , I saw myself , my own eventual mortality . I saw all the things I meant to accomplish but didn 't . It was an opportunity to vanish , to become someone else . Like I said , I 'm not proud of what I did . And so you refrigerated the body . I needed time to figure out how to pull it all off . Impersonating my brother , I called the bank , told them I needed a vacation week , a trip to Mexico . Then the bank received word that I 'd been in a terrible accident . It gave me plenty of time away from work . And you posed as an amputee ... to allay suspicion that you weren 't your brother . That , and I rather enjoy the sympathy , especially from the women in our office . You , uh , still haven 't explained ... why you left your brother 's body at the pier , or why you arranged to have his head fall off . He explained it . He put it so eloquently when we last spoke . It was my final performance . I wanted to go out with such a shock , such a denouement , as would forever be remembered in the annals of magic . That was your last performance . What 's this for ? Well ... I still think you 've got a few tricks up your sleeve . My God . We gave you handicapped parking . We built you a ramp . Did he have access to the vaults ? Well , yes . He has a key to the day gate . Several of us do . - What are you looking for , Mulder ? - Any hint at all ... as to why Maleeni here is really impersonating his brother . What about this ? Could he have removed the funds electronically ? He didn 't have security clearance for E.F.T. s ... electronic fund transfers . Maybe he got around the security . Can we check the withdrawal records ? It would require your badge number and thumbprint ... and probably a federal subpoena to boot . We 're extra cautious with the E.F. T.s. You can understand why . There may be an easier way . If I call up a transaction list for this terminal ... No . No , everything 's in order . Mulder , it says here something about a robbery attempt yesterday . Yeah , that wasn 't against us , but the armored transport service we deal with . No money was taken and no suspects were caught . Yeah , well , Mr. Pinchbeck was the employee who signed out the truck . - He knew the schedule . - I had nothing to do with that . Maybe , maybe not . We 'll hold you till we find out . Make sure you don 't pull a vanishing act . - Hey . Paul , I 'm putting Mr. Pinchbeck in six . Right . Sleep tight . Wait . Don 't I get a phone call , sir ? - Sir ? - How 'd it go ? - Swimmingly . Abracadabra , man . Oh , damn ! Yes . Okay . - All right . All right , thank you . - Maleeni ? He 's still in the city lockup , where he 's been since we arrested him last night . Certainly doesn 't look like he did this . Lots of fingerprints . Yeah , I guarantee you , none of them match our thieves . They 're too clever to leave clues , except for the ones they want us to find . - Excuse me . May I show you something ? - Hmm . We thought the security-camera footage might show the robbers . - Does it ? - No . They all mysteriously ... went blank from about 3 : 00 a.m. to 3 : 20 , - But that 's not what we wanted you to see . - This is from two days ago . Cissy Alvarez , convicted bank robber . - You recognize this man ? - Yeah . Who is he to you ? - I know those tattoos . That 's the man who tried to rob my truck . Aah ! What the hell , man ? What did I do ? Yo , F.B.I. , what 's up ? What 's up with this , man ? You can 't just come bustin 'in here ! I got civil rights ! I 'm gonna call my lawyer , and then we 're gonna see what 's what . - There 's nothing back there . - This is harassment , man . This is harassment ! Yo , what are they lookin ' for ? - Come on ! Somebody talk to me ! - Shut up ! No , you shut up ! Yo , man , this ain 't right . Why you got the cuffs on so tight ? Yo , will you please tell me what he 's lookin 'for ? Oh ! - What ? - Well . Saving up for a rainy day ? - Oh , no , no , no ! We got framed ! This is a frame-up ! - Let 's go . - It was the magician ! - The magician ? Maleeni ? No , not the dead one , man ! That little cabron LaBonge ! LaBonge set me up ! - Listen to me ! Listen to me ! - Billy LaBonge . And the Amazing Maleeni . That 's a double bill I wouldn 't want to miss . Pinchbeck . You made your bail . You , too , LaBonge . - Okay . - I think releasing these two may be a bit premature . - Give us a minute . Good morning , gentlemen . Did you sleep well ? Agent Mulder . Agent Scully . - Bravo . Really . - What do you mean ? Last night the Cradock Marine Bank was robbed of $ 1.8 million . This morning that entire amount was found ... in the possession of Mr. Cissy Alvarez . Wow . I told you he was bad news . Bravo to you . - It was expeditious police work . - Well , thank you . It was , wasn 't it ? It 's only that Alvarez was so obviously guilty ... a convicted bank robber caught red-handed , witnessed trying to rob an armored car just two days earlier ? - He 'll need a good lawyer . - Yeah . - Yeah , he 's up a creek , just like you two want him . - Yeah . I don 't quite see where you 're headed with this . I have no evidence , but I have a theory , Mr. Maleeni , and , uh , I 'll tell you how it goes . I think that your twin brother Albert died of a heart attack , at which point , you and your young protegee saw a golden opportunity . My protegee ? I hate this guy 's guts . That 's what you wanted us to think . You wanted revenge against the man who made your life in prison a living hell . I did time with you about eight years ago . Alvarez . You and he were on the same cell block eight years ago . It was a setup from the start . You played poker with him , and you made sure that you lost big . Which gave LaBonge an in with Alvarez once everybody thought you were dead . LaBonge planted Alvarez 's marker in Maleeni 's van and made sure we found it . And then you used Alvarez 's greed in order to ensnare him , and then orchestrated the attempted bank robbery in order to implicate him . Yeah , that was you in the armored car disguised as Alvarez . Somehow Mr. Pinchbeck got ahold of the guard 's gun and switched the clip . - Hold it ! - Guard didn 't know it , but he was firing blanks . And then last night , the two of you robbed the bank ... and planted the money at Alvarez 's place . Don 't you think we have pretty good alibis ? You have great alibis . You have the best alibis in the world , which is why I think you two got arrested in the first place . With your expertise in sleight of hand , pickpocketing and escapology , I think you were both able to get out of here by pilfering a guard 's key . You could have escaped , stolen the money , framed Alvarez ... and been back here in time for breakfast . Scrambled eggs and sausage . That would be the world 's greatest trick , wouldn 't it ? One that would be forever remembered in the annals of magic . - What happens to us ? - To you ? You go free , provided the magic is over . The great ones always know when to leave the stage . Billy , let 's get the hell outta here . - They are the world 's greatest . - We saw through their magic . Ah , there 's more . Behold . - The Amazing Maleeni 's wallet . - You picked his pocket ? No , I pilfered it from the evidence room to prevent them from completing ... their final act of prestidigitation . - What are you talking about ? - I began to wonder , why did they need so elaborate a setup ? Why so high profile ? Why draw the attention of the F.B.I. in the first place ? We were the last piece of the puzzle . Yes . Framing Alvarez was just another misdirection . This trick was about E.F.T. s , electronic fund transfers at the bank . Maleeni , Pinchbeck , he didn 't have security clearance for them , so he needed a little federal law enforcement intervention ... specifically , my badge number ... and my thumbprint . With those two items they could pull off an E.F.T. and steal enough electronically ... as to make that 1.8 million look like cigar-lighting money . But they can 't do it without this . Pick a card , Scully . Any card . You know , Mulder , there 's still one thing that you haven 't explained . What 's that ? How the Amazing Maleeni was able to turn his head completely around . - I don 't know that . - I do . I 'll show you . Observe . Gee ! Very nice . How 'd you do that ? Well ... magic . No , seriously , Scully . How 'd you do it ? You know , it 's not the same thing . Uh , it 's different with the head . Come on , now . Look at this .

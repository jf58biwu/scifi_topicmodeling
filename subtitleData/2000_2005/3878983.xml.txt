 It looks like Sage but it 's not . Well , it smells like sage to me . No , Summer Savory I think . You know , there are about seven hundred varieties of the mint family ? - Seven hundred ? - Oh maybe more ... the plant world is evolving all the time ... like everything else on this beautiful planet of ours . We 're never going to finish this list . Oh , of course we are . And don 't you forget the benefits of a well stocked medicine cabinet . Anything on here for sore feet ? Yeah , your oil of cloves is good for that I think . Which of course we don 't have yet . No , you just rest . I 'll go and look around . I 'll fill these canteens . Don 't wander too far . I 'll stay on my guard . If we didn 't go around beating ourselves up every day ... we wouldn 't need all these lotions and potions . Sage , the wisest of all plants . How bad is he hurt ? Bad enough . He 's old , we have to take him . No . Pakim . - What ? - We still have time . No we don 't . It 's getting late . Let 's reset the trap and go . We don 't have a choice Tomu . We cannot go back empty handed . We still have tomorrow . And if we fail again tomorrow ? At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World - Any sign of him ? - Didn 't you hear the screaming ? Just the pleasant chatter of this babbling brook . Come on , get your gear , let 's go . Challenger ! Damn him , if he doesn 't stop wandering off like this . - What ? - Someone 's been here . That 's close enough . How nice . - You see something ? - No I think we 're alone . That cage isn 't big enough for a person . Which means whoever set it was hunting smaller game . Challenger was here all right . Yeah , and something definitely attacked him . Three people , and it doesn 't look like he walked away . Over here . - Why do you keep looking back ? - I don 't . Yes you do . You 're afraid this man has friends and they 'll come looking for him . This is wrong , Pakim . This man is not a savage . Neither are we . They can 't be that far ahead of us . I hope he 's still alive . Ugh . What is that smell ? Smells like ammonia . It 's coming from the plants . I wonder if Challenger ... got a cutting of these for his medicine chest ? They went right through it . Well if they did they can 't be human . - Or they held their breath . - Oh ! Are you crazy ? We 've gotta go back ! Come on ! It goes on forever , no one could survive in this . Now I 'm never gonna get the smell out of my hair . You know maybe it wasn 't the best place for Challenger to build a windmill . We keep building it and the wind keeps knocking it down . I gotta say it 's better than a two day ... botany lesson from the old boy . I 'll grant you that and ... Marguerite did say she 'd stop singing ... if we got her phonograph fixed again . What more could you ask for . Sure is beautiful . Yep and peaceful . Well I guess we know ... who makes all the noise around here . What ... ? - Who are you ? - It 's alright ... you 're safe . You were knocked unconscious by a trap . - Where am I ? - We brought you to our village . What about my friends ? Where are they ? Friends ? We thought you were traveling alone . No , I was with two women . How long have I been unconscious ? Not long . Your friends can 't be far away . Don 't worry , we 'll send someone out to find them . We 'll bring them to you . Rest , rest . This is the only way we know how to survive . No , it isn 't . He looks like a wise man ... maybe he can help us find another way . There is no other way . Don 't you remember ... remember what it 's like out there ? The savages and animals will kill us all in no time . - And staying here is better ? - Yes . We may live a little longer but we 're all eventually going to die . Maybe Challenger isn 't even in there . What are you talking about ? Well maybe he escaped . Maybe he never was with them in the first place . He 's in there . I know he is . Oh ! Not again . Veronica ! Veronica ! You don 't suppose ? Care to take another walk ? It 's certainly an improvement . At least we can see the trail again . I just wish I knew where it was taking us . And here we are safe , but if you get to close to the jungle . It , It 's ammonia . The poison keeps all the predators out . This is the perfect place to live . It must be a hybrid of the Strapelia Genus . The sap is poisonous and the gas is toxic ... to everything except the insects required for pollination . It 's a gift to everyone who lives here . Your people and mine we have something in common . We do ? We both use the jungle for protection . What do you mean ? We live in a tree . in a tree house . That sounds like a great idea . Well it 's not as foolproof as this but , well it does the trick . How ... how do you get out of here ? And ... how did they get in ? Marguerite . Veronica . Oh . - Isn 't your mother looking for you ? - They must have touched the water . I 'm sorry I didn 't mean to worry you . Worried , we thought you 'd been dragged off ... and eaten by savages . But no , we weren 't worried in the least . Who are your friends ? Are you all right ? Well , apart from a bump on the head . Pakim and Tomu this is Veronica and Marguerite . - What is that ? - It 's feeding time . Feeding time for what ? The most amazing flower you 've ever seen . Now we 're here perhaps we 've got time to stop and smell the roses . I hope it smells better than what we just went through . - My God . - That 's what I call a daisy . Biggest daisy I 've ever seen . I have never seen a flower like that . There is no other like her . How do you know it 's a her ? Well the perfume . Can 't you smell it ? Yeah , it 's hard to believe it 's even related ... to the jungle all around us . What do you mean ? Well , the flower in the jungle that protects us is all one plant . One plant ? And just as she protects us , we feed and care for her flower . How long have you been here ? Our parents came here when we were very young . - What happened to them ? - They ... died . They were chased across the Plateau by ... cannibals and dinosaurs , every savage you can imagine . But they made it here and left us safe ... from the horrible things outside . It has to be fed once a day . Oh , how very demanding of her . Oh , you 're not serious ? We 're vegetarians , but the flower needs meat . Live meat ? That 's why we catch them in a trap . Oooh ! I don 't even want to think about what you feed it for dessert . I 've seen enough . Coming Challenger ? Oh , you 're more than welcome to stay . Maybe we should . I mean , it 'll be getting dark soon . You 'll be safe here . We can continue our excursion tomorrow . I suppose it wouldn 't hurt . We 're not expected back to the treehouse until tomorrow night . Which means Roxton and Malone won 't even be worried about us yet . How are you going to keep them here tomorrow ? I 'll think of something . Well we both know they can never leave . Wake up . Rise and shine . Those little hooligans have taken our weapons . Well you shouldn 't sleep without them . I 'm sure there 's no reason for concern . Really ? Yesterday they had pointed sticks ... today they have guns . Good luck . Make sure you look after each other okay ? If you fail again we have nothing left to feed the flower . Don 't do anything until we get back . Alright . The hunt will be good today . Marguerite calm down . Hurry ! Children shouldn 't play with guns . Hand them over . You 're right , there 're a lot of children around . You can have your weapons back when you leave . We gotta get going . But it 's been so nice having elders around . Yes , especially when they have things that you can steal . Hand over the hardware . I 'm sorry , the plant only lets out three a day ... and the hunters have just left . I don 't understand , the plant won 't allow us to leave ? No one else can leave until the flower has been fed again . Yeah right , we know where your little secret is . Coming you two ? I promise you the flower won 't let you leave . If you think I 'm staying in this demented vegetable ... patch a moment longer you are hallucinating . Marguerite we already tried that . No one has ever made it . Well I will and so can you . Marguerite , wait ! Great ! Now we have to go after her . Put that over your mouth and nose . - No , please ... no . - Go , go . Marguerite ! We 're never going to find her . We have to turn back . Not until we find her . Here ! Marguerite ! We have to get her out of here . Breathe , damn you ! Did we make it ? No . You try that again you die where you fall . We 're trapped . Until tomorrow anyhow . It 's a good idea using canvas this time instead of palm fronds . Weaving was never my strong suit , Ned . I just hope we have enough . Maybe not enough to fix the hot air balloon ... but we should have enough for this job . Have you seen the material Challenger 's working on for the new balloon ? Yes , some new synthetic rubber . - The man is a genius . - He is indeed . Ah , I think you 're stretching it a little too tight there . It 's gotta be tight . Too much slack the wind will catch it , rip it to pieces . But too much tension the wind will split it wide open . - Since when are you an expert ? - It stands to reason , that 's all . What about practical experience ? You ever heard of trim the sails ? Do you ever hear of snug but not too tight ? Yeah , but in an entirely different context . Okay , you do it your way and I 'll do it mine . Fine , two sails left , one apiece . Tomorrow all three of us are walking out of here through the magic tunnel . Marguerite perhaps I should handle this . We have to go hunting every day . Only a hunting party can leave . - Take a day off . - We can 't , our stocks are low . How low ? Our lives depend on feeding the flower . If only two of our hunters go out ... then maybe one of you can leave a day . All of us ... tomorrow . Now just a second Marguerite , it sounds like a workable solution . Well , we can 't just leave them high and dry . So Marguerite leaves tomorrow and Veronica the day after . Challenger , I don 't know about this . Please , we 're not strong enough to fight you . We need your help . Then you should have it . These people aren 't hurting anyone Marguerite , they 're scarcely children . Well throw it back . It 's not going to kill you . I 'm not looking to adopt a family , thank you very much . And what exactly happened to their parents again ? They died saving the children . Yeah that 's right they died , but Pakim didn 't say how . Oh Marguerite , you 're not really suggesting ... they fed their parents to the flower , are you ? - We got one ! - Yes ! If we 're not back by tonight Roxton and Malone will start to worry . They 'll never find us here . I still think that we should leave tomorrow . How are they going to stop us ? Well they 've got our guns for starters . And pointy little sticks . All we 've got is a bunch of dead plants . Damn it , I knew I should have helped Roxton with the windmill . What are you doing ? It feels a little soft right here . Oh my God ! Oh . Ow . It 's a tunnel . I 'm fine , don 't worry about me . Who dug this ? Not Pakim , this is her Garden of Eden . My guess is there were other people here before the children ... and they tried to dig their way out . I hope they made it . Why bury the entrance ? Oh , I think that was a cave-in . Which means there could be more cave-ins along the way . We must be past the edge of the village by now . Half way across the poison jungle by my calculations . - This tunnel could go all the way . - I sure hope so . Isn 't a faster way out of here to dig in a straight line ? They seem to have worked around the roots for some reason . I mean , this root system is , it 's massive . Oh that 's a good sign . These people are dressed entirely different to our friends upstairs . Which means you 're right , there were other people here before them . Lord knows how long this Venus Flytrap has been luring its victims here . End of the line . That 'd be right . Let 's move . It 's coming . Hurry , we must get back to the village . Fifteen thirty feet . The three of us could dig it out in a couple of days . Digging around underground like little rodents . What ? Another little piggy gone to market ? This may not be the best place to be right now . We have to tell them about the tunnel . We can 't . It might be the only way we can get out of here . Where 's the evening meal ? What is this ! The hunters haven 't returned and the flower must be fed . I 'm sure they 'll be back in a minute . It can 't wait . She 'll go into shock and attack the village . What do you mean attack ? First the injured then the old . - This is barbaric ! - Throw him in ! This is what happened to your parents Pakim ? - This is no solution ! - Let him go ! Take one of your own ! Stop ! We were attacked . The pig escaped . I told you to wait until we got back . I couldn 't wait . Let him go ! No . Tomu you can 't . - I have to . - Please ! No - I 'm the oldest Pakim and I 'm injured . - No , please , no . No ! Those are the rules we live by . How many of us have died for this flower Pakim ? No . Tomu , we have found another way . It 's too late , too late for all of us . You 're flapping in the wind Malone . Ah , you 're wound up tighter than a cheap watch . I guess you 're buying the drinks . Well , I guess you spoke too soon . Damn . It must be the canvas . You know what ? A cold beer would go really well right now . Yep , well we could always drop down the local pub ... or the dancehall , huh chat up the girls . - Now you 're talking . - There 's always the local Trogs . their conversation 's not too stimulating , but uh . Yeah , like you care . Hey easy , boy-oh . Gee what a surprise . Take care . Well I guess the hunting party left without us , huh ? Our supplies are low , maybe in a few days . I bet you say that to all the guests . We 're all in this together now . Yeah , one big happy family . You 're awake . Oh yeah , been awake most of the night . So have I. Time to go look for Challenger 's botany class . They said they were heading east . Let 's hope they didn 't get distracted . Think we 're past the jungle yet ? Another day at least . We 'll I hope you 're ready to face a hungry plant again . Sorry Challenger but you 're still first in line ... if the hunting party comes back empty handed again today . Thanks for the encouragement Marguerite , very motivational . If all three of us get back to work on this ... we might be able to save everybody in the village . Why do you even care about those filthy little urchins ? They just look at us like we 're plant food . Do you ever get tired of looking out for number one ? Not really , it 's pretty much a full time job . They probably got more plants then they know what to do with . Knowing Challenger that wouldn 't surprise me . Hey look . Malone , look out ! Thanks , I didn 't see that . I wonder if you 're not the first . - What is it ? - Shh ... They 're just kids ! Wait ! We won 't hurt you ! Unless you don 't stop now . Ammonia . This stuff can kill you . I think that 's the idea . There 's gotta be a way around this . Something we missed along the way . I guess Roxton and Malone are still ... waiting for us back at the treehouse . Let 's hope they never find this quaint little garden . Oh no , not again . Now I know why they avoided the roots . This is where they stopped . One of them touched something . This ? First prize , Ned Malone . I wonder what 's on the other side . Could be something good . When was the last time that happened ? Yeah . The hunters have returned with nothing . Step aside ! You 're trying to dig your way out . We found a tunnel . It 's almost all the way through . There 's enough room for all of us . We can all get out of here . Take them ! Stop ! Or she dies . If we don 't feed her now she 'll go into shock and gas us all . Pakim listen to me , if you help us finish the tunnel ... we can all get out of here . You and your people are just being ... - slaves to this terrible flower . - She 's our guardian ... she watches over us , protects us . We don 't stand a chance outside this village . Eventually she 'll kill you all . For now she 'll settle for you . What , me ? I thought we were starting to like each other ! Pakim ! Take me ! I am the oldest ! - Move away ! - Roxton ! Throw her in ! What kind of petunia is that ? You cannot destroy her . Move away from the edge Marguerite . Time for chopped salad . No ! I thought you went looking for herbs and spices ? Is that spicy enough for you ? Run ! Run ! Now she 's going to kill us all . Get away ! Get away ! Everyone get away ! - Why did you shoot it ? - What did you want me to do , Marguerite ? Oh my God . What the hell 's going on ? He 's trying to stop the gas but it 's too late . - Get out of here . - Haven 't you already done enough ? Go ! We 're never gonna get out of here . Yes we will . There 's a tunnel . - You dug a tunnel ? - Well I had a little help . Yeah , it 's filling up with gas , remember ? You cut a root . We can 't abandon the children . We have to find a way to kill that thing . It 's not a thing , it 's a whole jungle . No , it 's all one plant . One plant ? Yeah , one very big ugly weed . That 's it . One plant , one tap root ... running straight down through the earth right underneath the flower . Who cares about the bloody tap root ? You cut off the supply of nutrients and the plant dies . You come with me . You two ... round everyone up get them into the huts and onto the floor . Do I look like Florence Nightingale to you ? Come on . Come on . This way . 1 2 3 All right we start digging here . How Far ? Five or six feet if we 're lucky . We 'd better start getting lucky soon . Over here ! Cover your nose and mouth . Stay on the floor . Stay on the floor . Come on , back to the huts . Run , back to the huts . Take her , I 'll go after him . No , damn it I will . Wait ! Come back ! Where are you ? I think we found the buried treasure . Hand me the axe . Pruning time . Here , cover your face . Cover your mouth and nose . I 'm sorry I didn 't play with you ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Marguerite ? Pakim ! No ! We 're halfway through . It 's got to be doing something . - It 's calling out for food . - You don 't scare me anymore . No ! I 'm pretty sure it 's going to have a hard time swallowing . Fight Pakim , fight ! Let go of me ! You can 't give up ! Keep going , we 're almost through . Go on inside . I promise I won 't leave without you . Okay ? No , no , no ! We 're through . I think it 's dying . I 'm all choked up . She 's alive . It really is dead . What will happen to them ? Well , they 'll have to find another hobby . And another place to live . How will we manage now ? There are dangers ... but you 'll survive if you stick together . How ? Where will we go ? Well I don 't think you should give up on plants just yet . What do you mean ? Tree houses . Perhaps we could teach you how to make a tree house . We can live in the trees like monkeys . Yes and just like us . This is what you were doing while our lives were in peril . The wind must have kicked up , tore it to pieces . Maybe a Pterodactyl hit it a couple of times . I fail to see the humor , no electricity . - No phonograph . - No perimeter fence . Well I guess we 'll be closer to nature for a while . Don 't even mention that word . Come on Marguerite , it won 't be that bad . We certainly won 't miss the phonograph with your wonderful singing voice . In that case , we best get started on the windmill tomorrow . * *

 Good to have you back , David . ... possibility of our miraculous cloning of Jesus . What do you know about this Walsh guy ? I didn 't make a mistake David . Okay , don 't lose it on me , Bob . Do you have any idea what you 're saying here . And the return of Christ is only the beginning . - Is Hira on it ? - She 's been locked out . Do you know Hira has a brother who 's a member of a terrorist cell in Pakistan ? I want her back . So do I , when I 'm satisfied she works for us . Have you ever heard of a Dr. Shelby Sloan ? That 's your father ? You have no idea what I was capable of 15 years ago . Well , Mick does . We are entering a great new age of enlightenment . I was approached by the Pakistani military . While the rest of you were imaging the impossible , I was doing it ! Best defence : mutually assured destruction . Your dad 's got to believe me now ! I mean , he 'll want a study . The truth is , I created one son to save another . Blood from which we have cloned the Christ child . - Shit ! - David , let 's just go in the back . - Oh , no , no , no . - ... have been genetically broken down by 4 ... No , no ! 1x04 - Prions I 've never been to a Muslim funeral before . Weird how it 's just men , huh ? Bob , you don 't have to stand here with me . I don 't mind . I 'll just go over afterward ... and say something to the family . I 'll see you back at the lab . Mr. Khan . I ... I don 't know why this happened . I 'm sorry . My daughter was proud . You made her feel ashamed ! You ! You ... Although the outbreak was contained , the terrorists behind the camel pox / Ebola epidemic are still at large and should be considered an ongoing threat to worldwide security . NorBAC will continue its research in an effort to neutralize any further threat the Miranda virus may pose to the global community . Though NorBAC was not conceived as a law enforcement agency , we will continue to assist authorities in their investigation of the person or persons behind the virus , as well as provide any information we can into the shooting death of Dr. Hira Kahn which at this time appears to be the act of a lone gunman . Ladies and gentlemen , on a personal note . I think I speak for everyone at the NorBAC lab when I say that Dr. Kahn will be sorely missed . So , how was it ? How did it go ? What ? The funeral . I don 't feel like listening to music right now . So , were you and Hira tight , or ... ? How long did you know her for ? Yeah , you do know that school 's the other way , right dad ? It 's fine with me , I mean I have to register . I can register next year . I 'll take you to school after we stop by the lab , all right ? Okay . Fine . Why is British intelligence getting involved ? I don 't know . An agent Digby wants you to get back to him though . - Collin Digby ? - You know him ? We 've worked together before . What about him ? He 's going to be in town tomorrow . I 'll set up a meeting . Okay , what about the shooter ? He 's still uncooperative . He 's not talking . Uh , the report says that he 's suicidal , detached and signs of delusional psychosis . Okay , anything else ? Hira 's replacement . Are you still interested in Jill Langston ? - Absolutely . - Her background check cleared . What do you want me to do about David ? For now let 's just get her on his radar . Set up something informal . Maybe in Chicago when he 's there next week . - Will do . - Is that it ? We 've got a situation developing in the States related to a prion type disease . - Prion ? - Mad cow . How bad is it ? I don 't know for sure , but I 'm going to get an update this afternoon . Okay , brief David on everything you 've got . Right . Are you on a flight this afternoon ? Sounds like I 'd better be . - I 'll see you when you get here . - Okay . Thanks , Wes . Just wait in the car . I 'll only be 5 minutes . I don 't want to wait in the car . You know , when the police called and told me you were shot , I called mom and she asked me if it was in a bar . That 's because that 's where your mother generally shoots people . Is that where it happened ? Dr. Sandstrom ? Excuse me , Dr. Sandstrom . - I know this is hard for you . - Don 't make it any harder . Those people who gathered here the other day were devout believers in what we 've accomplished . - Even the guy with the gun ? - No , of course not . - Goodbye , Reverend . - Dr. Sandstrom , please . You hold in your grasp the acknowledgement that Jesus will soon be reborn . Go . Your accreditation means a great deal to all of us involved in this project . Really , what 's a great deal ? I think an honorarium wouldn 't be out of the question given the importance . Now , you 're not trying to buy my opinion , are you ? No , of course not . I want the truth , Dr. Sandstrom . Oh , I can make myself believe . A top scientist like you , I 'm sure you 'd command a substantial compensation for your services . Say ... $ 100,000 . Wow , that much for the truth , huh ? Well , I think that 's fair . I guess everyone 's got their price , eh , Walsh ? Apparently . Asshole . Jesus Christ . You hit him ! Did I ? Go wait up in my office . - I can 't believe you ! - Upstairs ! Can I help ? Do I look like I need any help ? What do you want , Wes ? I have a report for you from the CDC . God . 5 minutes , Lilith . What 's that ? Oh , Hira 's stuff . Make sure it gets back to her family , would you ? - David , about this report . - Ah , yes , We have 4 victims of an advanced prion type disease . That sounds interesting . What do you think , Mayko ? What ? Oh yeah , I guess we should just get back to work , huh ? Caroline wanted me to brief you . I 'm briefed . It 's bullshit . I 'm sorry ? Page 1 : a 5 year old kid with prion disease ? What ? It takes at least 7 years for a prion protein to fuck up the brain and then at least another year after that before you die . Where are you going ? Does everything around here have to be about work ? ! What would you like it to be about ? Hira 's dead , David ! Yeah , she 's dead . Got it . Got it . Wes , you got it don 't you ? Yeah , Wes has got it . Wes has got it , I got it , even her family 's got it . They know just who to blame too . - Stop it . - Stop what ? Life ? Hira took a bullet , that 's it , game over , we move on . I 've got to get out of here . Caroline also wanted me to set up a meeting with you and a replacement for Hira . - I 'll get back to that later . - Good idea , Wes . Lilith , let 's go . Thanks . You hit him ! Did I ? Wait upstairs in my office . - I can 't believe you ! - Upstairs ! Hello , Lilith . I 'm Bob Melnikov . Remember me ? - I did some tests on Mick . - Hi . I wanted to say that I 'm sorry we couldn 't come up with something to help Mick . He 's a nice boy . Yeah . Yeah , I thought we might have had a chance using gene therapy . What do you mean , might have had a chance ? - No , we still do , just not in ... - 5 minutes Lilith . I started doing the analysis of snips in Mick 's genome and found so many rare polymorphisms . We just need to find the genes that are making him sick . I thought we had found something on chromosome 19 , but then when I looked closer , lots of healthy people have that gene too , so that was a dead end , but I 'm not discouraged . Good ... Then you could still find something ? Oh , sure . We 'll keep looking . He doesn 't have a whole lot of time left . - I know . - Lilith , let 's go . Thanks . You 're pushing it pretty hard out there . Yeah . You in training or something ? No . Just keeping the cardiovascular in shape . You must be pretty serious if you 're out in weather like this . Yeah . So , what do you do when you 're not running ? - I work at a lab . - Ah , a scientist . - What kind of scientist ? - Would you ... If you ask me , you scientists are getting a little out of control . Well , I guess I 'm not asking . Like , I heard they grew this whole person in a jar in some Korean laboratory . I mean , what 's that about ? I don 't know . I don 't do that . Well , what do you do ? I try to make the world a little better , okay ? That 's what I do . Making the world fucking better . Fucking scientists ! Okay , great , school . Where are you going ? Don 't you want me to come in with you ? No . It 's you first day . Just go back to your lab , dad . Okay , well . You know , if you need me , just ... Yeah . Spongiform encephalopathy , it 's a brain wasting disease originally know as Kuru-Kuru . It was passed from human to human by cannibals in Papua New Guinea . - You 're kidding . - Not at all . The women and children honoured their deceased ancestors by ritually eating their brains , therefore passing the disease on from generation to generation . - I 'm glad I 'm not a cannibal . - Oh , you can still get it , from infected meat , scrapie in sheep , mad cow in cattle . It 's very effective at crossing species . - Any more good news ? - I don 't think that 's good news . Thanks , Bob . I 've got to get back to it . Since 1990 when mad cow entered the human food chain , 20 people have died . Who knows how many more are infected , having their brains slowly wasted . Oh man , they wanted transcripts and proof of where I lived , and photo I.D. , and all this ... So , did you have all that stuff though ? No , of course not . Well , then aren 't you going to go back there and to talk to them or ... ? No way , I am totally out of there . You 're going to have to do it at some point . Yeah , I don 't ... I really don 't care , Mick . So , are you okay , or ... ? What 's up ? Uh , nothing much . I just got back from the hospital . Oh , yeah ? How often do you have to get tested and stuff ? Every couple of weeks and it 's no big deal . So , how 's your dad doing ? - He 's all right . We talked . - Yeah . I 've never seen him cry before . So , what are you going to do about school ? I don 't know . Life 's too short . Yeah , kinda know . Oh , I was at my dad 's lab today and I was talking to this Bob guy and he was explaining to me this idea he had to help you . It 's okay . Hi . Hi My dad 's going to find something , Mick . It 's okay . I 'm serious . It 's okay . David , I think I got one . It looks like an old human strain . Take a look at the sequence over here . And this . Oh shit , do you think this could be a piece of the Spanish lady ? It is , David . You want to ... ? Not really . Yes , you do . Come on , dump it . Dump it . No . Oh , Jesus . Finally , icing . You know , you 're going to have to explain icing to me again , David . You okay ? I 'm fine . You know , I was thinking . When you 're lying in your casket with your family and friends standing over you , what would you like to hear them say about you ? I don 't know . Maybe I 'd like to hear them say that I was a great doctor or a fine son . No , I know exactly what I 'd like to hear them say . And what 's that ? Look , he 's moving . Goodnight . You going to bed already ? Yeah , I am . I 'm kind of tired . Did you get everything all squared away with school ? Shoot ! Aw , shoot hit . - Hmmph ! Good night . - Good night . Huh ? Do you know Hira 's father spit on me today . Bob told me . I don 't know . Maybe I deserved it , eh ? I 'm the one who dragged her back to the lab and pulled her into that crowd of people . Don 't even go there , David . Why not ? It 's what happened . Right ? It 's what happened . What ? Jesus . Hey , slugger . - It 's good chicken . - You like that ? It 's Carlos ' recipe . You soak the chicken in tequila , then you throw it on the barbeque , and then you forget about the chicken and you drink the tequila . It 's nice . Shouldn 't you be getting ready for school ? Uh , I can 't till I register . I thought that 's what you were doing yesterday . To just register , dad , you need transcripts and photo I.D. , anyways , I 'm handling it . Good . What 's this ? Oh , that guy called you . He wants to talk to you or something . - Danny Dexter . - Yeah , who is he ? Uh , he 's this guy I used to kick around with in high school . He 's a hockey player now . What are you doing about school again ? Victim # 2 : Maurice White , 52 , San Antonio , Texas , geriatric trainer . Martin Crutchfield , 72 years old . Santa Barbara , California , retired lawyer . Last weekend he drove his car through an open market , killing 6 people , injuring 17 , 2 critically . He had no idea what he 'd done . Total loss of memory . He died yesterday . And finally , Sarah McKinley , Tampa Florida , 5 years old . - You got the pathology ? - I do . You 're not hungover ? No , I 'm not . Normal on your right , infected on the left . Coroners pathology confirms brain deterioration consistent with some kind of prion disease . You got any idea how a 5 year old brain ended up full of holes ? Prions don 't work that fast . - Prions ? You see , we all have these proteins in our brains called prions . Millions of them . They 're so small you can 't even see them under a microscope , and most of the time they 're just sitting around behaving themselves . But once in a blue , blue , blue moon , one of them goes bad . It 's kind of like Dr. Jekyll turning into Mr. Hyde . And then Mr. Hyde bumps into another Dr. Jekyll and turns him into another Hyde and they tell two friends , and so on , and so on and so on , and eventually you 've got all these hungry little Hydes going to work eating holes in your brain . - But not this fast . - How fast ? It would take a brain 7 maybe 8 years to get in this condition . All victims died within a week of showing symptoms . Okay , so it 's not behaving like it should . It 's infecting people who are too young , and it 's shutting down the brain too fast . It could be a virulent form of the disease we haven 't seen before . This prion disease , mad cow , whatever you want to call it . - There 's no test for it , is there ? - Not until you 're dead . - And no cure . - No . So , how are they getting it ? How are they getting it ? There has to be a common link . We need to know everything these people had to eat , whether they crossed paths , whether they were in the same place at the same time . - I 'm on it . - We need to know everything about them , right down to the last protein . That was a joke . Get Bob on the brain tissue as soon as it gets here . I want to run a mass spec on the prion fraction . - Tell him to look for mad cow . - Mad cow on steroids . Yeah , and double check the coroner 's pathology and made sure he got it right . I 'll do my own pathology . I 'm going to need access to that little girl . - I 'll arrange it . - Where 's Mayko ? She wasn 't feeling well . I told her to stay home . Oh , bullshit . Get her ass in here , start sequencing the victim 's DNA . Tell her to start looking at their prion genes , anything they might have in common . - Where are you going ? - Lunch . I see you still have the touch . David ! How are you ? I 'm great , really great . Better than you , apparently . I can 't believe I 'm looking at you . Yeah . Check it out , I dropped 11 Ibs , touch that ! BMI 's 25.3 . - White production up ? - Yes , not a rookie can touch me . Double cheese , rare , right ? Oh , yeah , you know . Fuck it . So , Danny , what 're you doing in town ? Well , David , I 'll tell you . Big boys want to huddle . No way . Yeah , little Danny Dexter 's moving up . Hmm . Lilith moved in . Wow , what is she ? Like 14 ? - Fifteen . - Ooh , tons of attitude . - Just like the old man . - Yeah , thanks . All right . See the game the other night ? Yeah , when Biriliski went through the boards there . What was that all about ? You didn 't hear ? He 's dead , David . Fuck off ! Heart attack . Holy shit . How old was the guy ? Three years younger than me , perfect health , playing better than ever . - Jesus . - Yeah , they think it 's ... - What ? Steroids ? - No , some kind of ... What do you call it ? One of those hormones that they can 't test you for . The designer slops . It 's tough to find something like that if you don 't know what you 're looking for . Yeah , but it beats pumping 'roids , right ? - Oh , yeah . Who told you that ? - I don 't know . I heard it . Why , do you think that shit 's dangerous ? I don 't think , I know . Oh , man . You 're not ... No ! I couldn 't afford it . Besides , do I look like a fucking idiot ? Yeah . Fuck you . Eight ball , corner pocket . It 's really amazing , isn 't it ? Something a billionth of our size can get into us and kill us in a week . Do you remember " War of the Worlds " ? I love that movie . Those space guys thought they had our planet . Shut up , Bob . What got them in the end was a little , tiny earthly virus . Just shut up ! I 'll clean that up . Just leave it , okay ! I don 't want to talk about the goddamn movie . - Sure . - I 'll have the numbers in a half hour . Thank you . Is everything okay ? She 's just a little tense , I think . She 'll be fine . It 's a little early for this , Bob . No , I mean , yes . I mean ... David wants me to run a DNA sample . It 's okay , Bob . We all have those days . Are you ... Are you the one who did the new autopsy on my baby ? Yes , I 'm Dr. Carlos Serrano . I 'm very sorry about your daughter . Uh , do you know anything yet ? Can you tell me anything ? I 'm sorry , no . We 'll need to do extensive tests . Of course . Sarah was my only child . Please . The doctors , they said this thing comes from blood transfusions , tainted meat . As far as we know , yes . Well , she didn 't get any blood and she ate the same things I ate , so ... How come she got sick and I didn 't ? That 's what I 'm going to find out Miss . McKinley . She was fine . You know ... Sunday I went to her piano recital . She played so beautifully . Just the scales , you know , little things . She ... she didn 't miss a note and ... when she came home from school on Tuesday , she was tired . She couldn 't seem to control her hands . It would be one of the first symptoms of the disease . Oh , God . I should have done something sooner . No , no ... There 's no way you could have known what was happening . It got worse . She couldn 't play the piano . She couldn 't even remember her recital pieces , and then she seemed so lost . She just looked at me . She was so lost . I 'm so sorry . The next day , she was seeing things that weren 't even there . She was having trouble walking . The doctors , they did a scan of her brain , but there 's was nothing ... There was nothing they could see , anyway . But then they told me that she had this disease , something that only 60 or 70 year old people get . Old people , you know ? Yes . Well , why ? Why did this happen to my baby ? The infectious prion didn 't come from a cow . What then ? A sheep ? Wild animal ? What ? Well , are you ready for this ? It 's a human prion . You know , we 've already ruled out a natural occurrence . Statistically it 's too much of a long shot . - I know . - So , what are you saying ? It 's a human prion , so these people had to be feeding on other people . A 5 year old cannibal ? Show me the numbers . Hey , did you get anything off this ? No , I haven 't gotten to it yet . I will , I will . Okay , here you go . This is the protein sequence from Mr. White 's brain prions . The 52 year old from Texas . And this is the sequencing for the foreign prion we found in his brain . They look the same to me , Bob . 99.8 % the same . See this peptide right here ? That 's the difference . Both human prions : One his , one from somebody else . Well , that 's just ... wrong . Did you ever see " Sweeney Todd " ? The poor guy probably didn 't even know he was eating human flesh . Is this the same in all the victims ? Yeah , I 'm waiting for Carlos to get back with new brain tissue from the little girl . Who prepared the samples ? Mayko ran the mass spectrometer , I analyzed it . - Mayko fucked up . That 's the answer . - I don 't think so , David . - I was right here with her when she ... - Mayko ! Where 's your lab book ? Okay , where 's the section on the sample prep ? I didn 't write that up yet . What ? You think you could have screwed up the mass spec on the prion sample ? No . Okay , well I think you did . Do it over . I didn 't make a mistake ! I don 't care what you think , run the test again . Well , could I ask why ? Two human prions ? Jesus , Mayko , could you just do what I ask ? ! The numbers don 't make any sense ? ! I think you screwed up , okay ? ! Yeah , sure . If anyone 's goingto screw up around here it 's probably going to be me ! I think David just wants you to check ... I know what he wants from me , Bob ! Fuck him ! I think she 's been having a hard time with Hira ... Just run another sample , Bob . Sure . What are you doing ? - I always wanted this locker . - It 's mine , Bob . - But you 're going aren 't you ? - I didn 't say that . Yes you did . Not in so many words , but you said it . Put my stuff back , Bob ! I didn 't say I was going anywhere . Mayko . Mayko , you okay ? Okay , here you go . P-228 , semi automatic , 10 round clip . You can carry it in your purse . You 're not serious . Best protection you can get . I 'm not going to carry a gun around . It might make you feel a little safer . I 'm not going to carry a gun around ! Okay , well ... if you change your mind , you know where to find me . You want to go for a run ? I already did that , Carlos . - I 'll go with you . - I 'm asking Mayko . What 's wrong with Hira ? It 's all right , I understand . You understand ? What do you understand ? How can you understand ? Because I have to May . I can 't change anything . I have to understand . It 's perfect sense to me . It 's so easy for you isn 't it , Carlos ? Yeah , he 's fine . He just walked in actually . Do you want to talk to him ? Who is it ? It 's mum . Hello , Sarah , how are you ? " I anticipate we 'll remain in seclusion until well after the Christ child is reborn , for his own safety and security , so that the Christ child ... " Yeah , okay bye . Between your mother and that Reverend Walsh , I am definitely going to hell . Yeah , well this is going to cheer you up . A cop brought this by today . - Walsh is pressing charges ? ! - You decked him . I barely touched him ! Well I rented " Anger Management " today just so you could get a general idea about ... I 'm not taking anger fucking management classes . What 's all this ? I was just hanging out with Mick today . You know , Lilith , we are going over all the research . Sure . And I mean , I wish I could tell you everything 's going to be fine but ... You know , I really don 't need your Dr. Phil shit , thanks . Sorry . No , no . You 're right . You don 't . You know , I don 't think I 've got a single picture of Hira . Why are the best pictures always out of focus ? I didn 't even get to know her that well , not really . Which one of these 2 ? The one on the right . You think there 's something wrong with me , Lilith ? Oh , where do I begin ? How long was Mr. White a vegetarian ? I see . And no common dentist ? He never crossed paths with any of the other victims ? Okay . Thank you , Wes . Hey . How 'd it go in Tampa ? Uh , good . I already ran the new samples from the little girl . Same as before . Human prions ? We 're not coming up with any external common links . - Internal ? - Maybe . I found high titer antibodies in her blood , check all the other victims , same high levels . An infection ? I 'm going to scan their blood for viruses . It could be a common link . Okay , you know what ? I want you to check animal viruses too . This thing 's so bizarre , who knows . Right . David . Caroline wants you to take a look at these . What does she want me to do with them ? - They 're potential virologists . - Later , Wes . I took the liberty of setting up an interview with one of the candidates . She 's going to be in Chicago while you 're there . Look , don 't do any more setting up okay , Wes ? I will find a replacement for Hira when I am ready to find a replacement for Hira . Her name 's Jill Langston , Monday morning , 8 a. m . , your hotel . I don 't get up that early . Hey , Bob . Did you run the saliva on that beer bottle yet ? What are you reading ? Bob ! Did you run the saliva on the beer bottle yet ? Yeah , I put a report on your desk . - Anything ? - Nothing out of the ordinary . - Steroids , hormones ? - Nothing I could identify . Good boy , Danny . Good book ? Yeah , good . Cervantes still makes me laugh . You got a minute ? Sure . So , I started looking for things that connected the victims . - Internally , right ? - Yeah , yeah , of course . So , this is really cool . I isolated their DNA and did microarrays on each of them . What ? You okay ? Yeah . I don 't think you 're a fuck up . Yeah , I don 't think you are either . So , I thought I 'd look for common genetic patterns that connected them . The victims are 99.99 % like every other human out there but ... look at this . What 's that gene ? A hot new transporter , just posted on the internet . They think it channels proteins across the blood brain barrier . See , see right there ? The barrier 's supposed to keep chemicals from crossing into the brain , right ? But , with this transporter , it doesn 't . And the interesting thing is the victims all have this transporter . - And it 's really rare , David . - How rare ? Like 1 in 10,000,000 people have it . So this little transporter gene is a trigger firing mutant prions from the blood to the brain at an incredible rate ? So , the victims eats infectious agent , a huge mass of prions move into the brain , victim shows symptoms and is dead in a week . If you 're right , it would explain the accelerated course of the disease . But it still doesn 't tell us where it came from . Nope , but it gets us a little bit closer . Good work . Oh , you can still get it from infected meat , scrapie in sheep , mad cow in cattle . It would take a brain 7 maybe 8 years to get in this condition . All victims died within a week of showing symptoms . Both human prions : one his , one from somebody else . So how are they getting it ? The mice weren 't affected . We tried to suspend the prions in the air , but it wasn 't possible . - No exceptions ? - None . But there was a 48 % success rate by aspirating the prions directly at the test animals . So , that would mean transfer through a sneeze or cough . Yeah , which would eliminate transfer by air , since the victims never came into contact with each other . Yeah , they didn 't . No contact with each other , a vegetarian , 5 year old child . What 's the link ? What 's the link ? - Carlos . - Hey . So , the water from San Antonio , Santa Barbara , Tampa , all your normal ingredients : barium , fluoride , nitrite , tetrachloroethylene , - but not one single prion . - It was a long shot anyway . Any family history of prion disease ? No . The first thing I checked . Nothing . David , this report just came in . There 's no common links to any doctor or dentist . No common link , mad cow , tainted meat , vegetarian . Fuck ! I need more This thing 's got to be coming out of the food chain . It 's the only thing we 've got left . I 'll go back , get more details out of the victim 's families . I need a complete list of everything they ate for at least the last month , and I mean everything . - Sorry , I 'm late . - What ? What ? - It 's ALV , David . - In all of them ? - All of them . - ALV ? Avian Leukemia Virus . We use ALV as a genetic trick to make human proteins in eggs which is what we use to make vaccines . So , this could be spreading through flu vaccination ? Flu vaccination , hepatitis , DPT . What about chickens , eggs ? Right , they could easily be carrying the ALV . It makes perfect sense . All the pieces fit . Well , 3 common links are better than none . - A super transporter , David . - Oh , shit . What is it ? Mayko found a gene in all the victims . We think it might be accelerating the prions into the brain . Accelerating ? So , if the prions move at a normal rate and people who don 't have this super transporter ... Then the symptoms should start showing up in about 7 or 8 years . How many people are we talking about ? How many people ate a piece of chicken , an egg , or got a flu shot lately ? Mad cow , where do you find prion samples ? In 4 dead people . Sarah McKinley ate chicken tenders at Lord of the Chicken at least 3 times in the last month . You don 't understand , this is a government operated lab I 'm in now . I told you , I don 't know what they 'd do if they found out . - What did you take ? - I don 't know . Well , it 's not biaxin . Now who is the wide world of sports is experimenting with gene doping ? What ? Good morning . I 'm looking for a new scientist , not a name dropper . - How much of an asshole was I this morning ? - You were up there . I certainly have enough to go public and point a finger at White Valley Farms ' chicken . Surely you understand the ramifications of going public . These chickens could be carrying a fucking death sentence for millions of people . Subtitles : kubilai Lama Transcript : Raceman

 It is Friday December 8 , and you 're tuned in to WXOP , Baltimore 's news radio , serving Maryland and the greater Chesapeake region , 24-7 . We 've got your Friday morning trouble spots : a two-car pile-up with a fatality on the 97 ... lt 's time . John . The press got word you 're taking him out . It looks like Woodstock . Postpone the transfer . Get him out once the crowd disperses . - Transfer me where ? - No , they 'll camp out for days . - We 're going ahead with it . - John , what is goin ' on ? - Mr Wells . - Why did you do it ? All right , back up . Give him some room . Clear out . Back up . Al . Down ! Weapon ! Somebody call a medic . - John ... - Do you recognize this ? Have you seen it before ? Yes . - Who are you ? - Don 't even , Martin . What am I doing here ? I 'm in this cell. I don 't know where l am or how I even got here ... I swear to God , do not play this with me . I will not be party to some half-assed , eleventh-hour insanity defense . - What ? - lt 's time to start telling me the truth . This key card , Mr Wells . You do recognize it. ls that correct ? Yes , it 's the swipe card that they use at the apartment building . - For all I know , it 's mine . - lt is yours . It was found in the Dumpster behind the Strand Hotel . You tossed it there , didn 't you ? You had time to drive to Baltimore and commit the murder . Wait . Murder ? What murder ? Then drive back to DC , toss the key card . That way you could claim it was stolen . Make it look like you spent your whole night watching TV in your hotel room . Right ? Please . What murder ? What is he talking about ? Maybe this will jog your memory , buddy . Vickie . My wife . This isn 't happening . This is not happening . Court van is waiting . Dignity . That is your strong suit . Play it . Don 't lower your eyes . It makes you look guilty . We drew Judge Kinberg . What 's your relationship with him ? - Benjamin ? - First-name basis . Excellent . All rise . I remind the members of the gallery to turn off all cellular phones and paging devices . - Al ? - What ? He shot me . Who ? Your father-in-law ? What are you talking about ? Circuit Court , Department 6B is in session , the Honorable Benjamin Kinberg presiding . Thursday , the seventh day of December . Thursday ? It 's not Thursday . - lt 's Saturday . Yesterday was Friday and ... - Today is Thursday . There 's no court on Saturday . You know that . Martin , do you feel all right ? Case number 8ABX03 . District versus Martin Wells . Charge of first-degree murder . - The defence requested a hearing on bail ? - Yes , we have . Mr Wells ' status as a prosecutor makes him a target . We endanger him by keeping him in custody . I 'm assured by the Department of Corrections that Mr Wells ' safety is not a concern . Furthermore , as Your Honor will agree , Mr Wells is an upstanding citizen and a respected member of the Maryland Bar . Your Honor , with cold calculation , Martin Wells brutally stabbed his wife in their own home . He poses a threat to the public and should be denied bail . He doesn 't pose a threat to anyone , and he has two children who need him at home . Why ? Because their mom 's not around . Ms Carter . I can 't tell you how sorry I am to see you on that side of the aisle . I hope you 'll forgive me when I do exactly what you , as a prosecutor , would demand . Bail is denied . I will order Mr Wells transferred to a more secure facility in the interest of his safety . Transferred ? No , Ben . You can 't do that . I can 't be transferred . He 'll kill me . Tomorrow morning ... lf today is really Thursday , tomorrow is Friday , and that 's when he 'll do it . He 's gonna shoot me as I 'm transferred . - Bailiff . - You don 't understand . It 'll happen . Just listen to me . Ben , it 'll happen . He 's gonna kill me . Mr Wells , we understand that you had an interesting morning in court . What is it that you 'd like to speak with us about ? - You 're John 's partner ? - For God sakes . Agent Scully . You know that . You met her yesterday . - Yesterday ? - Yeah . Yesterday . Wednesday . - Wednesday ? - Are you saying that you don 't remember ? - What is the last thing you do remember ? - Being shot by my father-in-law . - You 're wastin ' our time . - Listen . I don 't know what I experienced . But what if it was a premonition ? A glimpse of the future . I mean , you do hear about these kind of things . Yes . You do . Mr Wells , this shooting aside , is there anything else that you remember before that ? I was in DC ... for a sentencing hearing . I was staying at the Strand Hotel , like you said . That was three days ago . Are you telling us that you don 't remember anything else ? Not the murder of your wife ? - No . - Out of the blue , charged with murder . You wake up one morning and you can 't remember a damn thing . You haven 't offered us one scrap of evidence to support your story . As your friend , I 'm gonna listen to anything you have to say , but I will not be lied to . I 'm not lying . You 're talking to me about key cards . I 'm sitting in ajail cell . I don 't understand any of this . But I did not kill Vickie . If you truly don 't remember , then how can you be certain that you didn 't ? Courtney , Haley . Hey , guys . It 's so good to see you . - Come on , give Daddy a big hug . - Hug your father , ni√±as . - How are they holding up ? - Good , Mr Wells . They wanna know when you 're coming home . Daddy has some things that he has to do - very , very important things . That 's why I have to be here right now . But then , guess what . I 'll be coming home . Grandpa says they won 't let you come home . Trina , I need you to get me something out of the apartment , from the girls ' room . Thank you . Why didn 't you say before the hearing ? I hadn 't even met you before the bail hearing . Nanny cam . I wish you 'd talked to me about this before . I don 't know if this is a great idea . This may have the murderer on it . Whatever is on that tape , I am an officer of the court. I have to share it with the prosecution . You think I 'm guilty . Let 's clear this up right now . Here . My apartment . That 's the girls ' room , and this must be the police investigation . What time did the murder occur ? The official report has the police arriving at your apartment at 6 : 20am Monday morning . Your key card was used at 4 : 17 . Which means the killer is somewhere in-between . Wait . There 's your wife . We must have missed something . - Right there . - Martin , that 's you . - l 'm not goin ' . - How 's that ? I told you this is the day . If I go , I 'll get shot . You cannot transfer me . I don 't plan to . Your lawyers wanna see you . Here 's my favorite client . Martin , you holding up all right ? Brent. I 've been better . We 're gonna beat this thing . Guaranteed . I have here one of the finest criminal-defense specialists . Meet ... We met. I 've been thinking about the tape , and I don 't see you having to turn it over to the prosecution . I 'm sorry ? I obviously showed you that tape in an effort to clear my name , not as an admission of guilt . Mr Wells , I 'm Janet Wilson . I don 't think we 've met . Martin , what is all this about a video tape ? The nanny cam tape . - That 's why you 're here . - l 'm here to introduce you to your attorney . We met yesterday at the bail hearing . Don 't you remember ? Martin the bail hearing is set for tomorrow . What day is this ? What day of the week is this ? Wednesday . Wednesday the 6 . Yesterday you told me it was Thursday . The day before that it was Friday . It 's backwards . Everything 's going backwards . I think we should have you speak to someone . You 're under a lot of stress . Being locked up in this cesspool doesn 't help . We can have you out by tomorrow afternoon . The prosecution 's case is weak to say the least . They have no physical evidence tying you to the crime . Plus , they don 't have the key card that was used to access your apartment building . The key card . Without it , they 've got nothing . Oh , yeah . Somebody likes you , my brother . Come on. I 'm just messin ' with you . You ain 't got no sense of humor , Counselor ? - Do I know you ? - No , you don 't know me . Damn sure put me in here , though . Possession with intent . And concealed weapon . That concealed weapon was a pipe wrench . I was on my way to my baby 's mama 's house to unstick her garbage disposer , but I told you all that . " Concealed weapon " added six months to my sentence . You remember my name ? No . All I needed to know about you was that you broke the law . I broke the law . I guess that makes you " Wife Killer , Esquire . " Pick ' em up , you stumbling bitch . Jeez , Martin . Your face . It 's all right . Appreciate you coming . Agent Scully , I especially wanted to talk to you . It 's nice to meet you. I 'm sorry it 's not under better circumstances . This is the day we meet . Something is happening to me . Something I need to try to explain to you , to you both . I 'm moving backward in time . Every morning I wake up , it 's the day before . For me , yesterday was Thursday . The day before was Friday . Only it 's all new to me every single morning I wake up . I can only remember what 's happened the following day . Agent Scully , would you mind taking a closer look at his injuries ? Maybe check his scalp . I know this all sounds crazy . But I 'm telling you the truth . This cut , for instance . It was on my cheek when I woke up yesterday . I woke up this morning , it wasn 't there . But then this afternoon , I got cut . I killed a spider in my cell yesterday . First thing this morning , I woke up , it 's back again . Because it happened the day before . I haven 't killed it yet . Mr Wells , are you saying you don 't remember the day that your wife was murdered ? I 'm talking about two days ago - Monday . No . I don 't ... remember it , because for me , it hasn 't happened yet . You do realize that you 're not gonna be able to prove this . Right ? I mean , if ... if tomorrow is really the day before today , then we won 't have had this conversation . - For cryin ' out loud . - You 're gonna have to tell us all over again . Yeah , well . Make sure I skip that freakin ' meeting . Let 's say that all this is true . Why do you think it 's happening ? I don 't know . There has to be a reason . What reason ? Something ... I 'm meant to understand ? Although I don 't know what it could be . Maybe you already have the answer within you . I 'd really prefer to stay while you do this , Martin . I can take you through the chain of evidence . I think I 've done this before , thank you , Ms Wilson . Lookin ' for some loopholes , huh ? Yeah , man , get yourself outta here . They praying that you find that one technicality so they can let you go . - l 'm not looking for technicalities . - What are you looking for ? - The truth . - The truth ? You better stick to the technicalities . The truth is gonna keep you in here and make you somebody 's bitch . That 's what the truth gonna do . So put on that engineering ' hat , Casey Jones , cos you got a whole lot of trains to be pullin ' . I know who did it . .. claims he arrived home from a business trip to discover the body of his wife in the living room . Apparently Wells is now in seclusion at the home of a friend . Baltimore Police are giving no indication whether he is a suspect , or if there are indeed any suspects at this time . However , Channel 9 News has learned police are focusing their investigation on a where about of an electronic key card , much like this one . The card in question belongs to Martin Wells . It was used by the killer to enter the apartment building through the garage . Wells claims no knowledge of its whereabouts ... Not something you wanna wake up to . How you feelin ' ? Disconnected from reality , but I guess I 'd better get used to it . Thank you. I assume you let me spend the night here . Right ? - Thank you . - Like I said , no problem . So that makes today Tuesday , the day after the murder . I know who did it now . - You know who killed Vickie ? - Latino . Maybe 40 , five ten , 185 pounds . He 's got a tattoo of a spider web on his left hand . Last night you said you had no idea who did this . Yeah , now I do . Trust me. I don 't know his name but you can find him in the Baltimore City lockup . Call ' em . They can id him based on what I just told you . I just wanna say my daughter was an exceptional person . One who was loved by everyone who knew her . Sir , have the police identified any suspects in your daughter 's death ? They 're not telling us much . What about rumors that your son-in-law is the prime suspect ? Reporting from the Calvert House Apartments , this is Brian Blakley . Back to the studio . No prisoner of that description was processed in the past 36 hours . He 's in there . He 's gotta be there . Sorry , Martin , he 's not . It must be too soon . He must not get arrested until later today - Tuesday . That 's how he could have been with me in lockup on Wednesday . You have seriously lost me . If you 're trying to admit something to me or to yourself , come out with it . There 's a reason all this is happening . - Maybe I already have the answer . - How 's that ? There 's something in my apartment that you need to see . - Where is it ? - The girls ' bedroom , right there . Martin ? is this it ? My daughters were at their grandparents ' , thank God . The bedroom door was open , with a clear view of the front hallway . The nanny cam is motion-activated , so it should have caught anyone coming in or out of the house . There I am . Nobody else on the tape between my wife and the police . I don 't understand it . I 'd say this makes you look more innocent than guilty . Look there in the mirror . The sun . Your wife comes home before the murderer enters the building at 4 : 17am . Her time of death is fixed shortly after that , well before sunrise . You came home later , when the sun was already up . The killer turned off the tape . The only question is how ? There 's a remote control for the nanny cam . It 's in a drawer by the front door . But nobody else knew about it except for Vickie and me . Are you sure about that ? FBl. I saw your curtains move . I know you 're in there . Mr Wells , I ... You knew about the nanny cam , didn 't you ? You told the killer about it . - You must have given him my key card , too . - Mr Wells l wasn 't even there that night . First thing you 're supposed to say is " What nanny cam ? " - ls this your guy ? - l 'm so sorry Mr Wells . He said he 'd hurt my family . He made me give him your key card . His name is Cesar Okcampo . He 's got a full sheet - assault and narcotics . - He knows the drill . He 's a clam . - We 'll have Trina 's testimony against him . Maybe we won 't . He 's got her so scared , we can 't count on her . John let me go in and talk to him . Please . He says he only wants to talk to you . - Why ? - You don 't know ? You 've got my name , my record , and you can 't figure it out ? Cesar Okcampo. I don 't know you . I never prosecuted you . Hector Okcampo , my brother . - What was the charge ? - Possession with intent . $ 50 worth of rock . - lt was his third strike , remember ? - l remember. I did my job . - You sent him up for life . - l did my job . I do it ten times a week , every week of the year . And for this , my wife is murdered ? You take away my dignity , my reputation , my life because your dirt beg brother 's where he belongs ? Brady versus Maryland . You know what I 'm talkin ' about . Brady versus the State of Maryland . Prosecution 's gotta turn over exonerating evidence . You had the word of three people . That wasn 't Hector 's rock . It was in a jacket that wasn 't even his , left beside him in the club . You knew that . You knew that and you suppressed the evidence . Are you telling me your brother is not a drug dealer ? My brother was a bus boy when you sent him up . He had two strikes on him . He wasn 't dealing ' no more . You sent him up for who he used to be . And cos it was easy . You broke the law . I tell you what we 'll do . You 'll be convicted of my wife 's murder , one way or another . Plead now and I 'll look into your brother 's case . Maybe I 'll find a way to recommend a reduced sentence . Time served . You want justice ? So do I . My brother 's dead . Hung himself in his jail cell a couple of weeks ago . Martin , a word . I 'm sorry , Martin. I tried to talk ' em out of it , but they think they have a case . Sir , turn around , please . Martin Wells , you are under arrest for the murder of Vickie Wells . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you . Come on , pick up . Pick up . Hey , there . This is the Wells ' residence , home of Martin , Vickie , Courtney and Haley . We can 't come to the phone right now , so please leave a message . Honey , this is Martin . Pick up the phone . Vickie , pick up the phone . Pick up the phone . It 's not four o 'clock yet . Vickie please when you get this , leave the apartment go to your parents ' house and wait for me to call . I 'm on my way back to the city . John , I need your help . Martin ? - Vickie will be murdered inside of two hours . - Vickie .. you mean your wife ? I called the Baltimore police . They might think I was a crank . You call them . - l can describe the suspect , his name everything . - How do you know all this ? I haven 't got time to explain . You wouldn 't believe it anyway . That 's a bad sign because it 's two something in the morning. I haven 't seen you in three years . - You 've got to give me something more to go on . - This is all happening for a reason . I 'm being given a second chance . A second chance to do what ? I prosecuted a man named Hector Okcampo . I suppressed evidence . He was innocent of the crime he was charged with . - Martin anything you say to me ... - You have to report . I put him away , he died in prison , his brother wants revenge . Simple as that . You could be disbarred for what you 're saying . You could go to prison loose everything . You understand ? I understand that I can save Vickie . Hold on a minute . - You got here in time . - Are you Martin Wells ? Yeah . Vickie ? There 's nobody here . We checked . - What exactly are we looking for ? - My wife 's gonna be attacked here tonight . The killer 's gonna use my key card to enter at 4 : 17 . It 's 4 : 20 now . I don 't understand . Where is she ? Tell you what . We 'll take a few sweep through the neighborhood , keep our eyes peeled . We 're a phone call away if you need us . Come on . - Hello ? - Al , it 's Martin . - Martin ? What time is it ? - Al ... - ls Vickie there ? - No . The kids are here . Vickie left hours ago. lsn 't she home yet ? Martin ? Martin , you scared the hell outta me . - Honey why aren 't you in DC ? What the ... - Where have you been ? I got a flat on the way back from my ... - Honey you 're scaring me . What 's wrong ? - We 're in trouble . We have to get out of here right now . Vickie , get in the bedroom . Lock the door . Call the cops and don 't come out until I say it 's OK . Oh , my God , Martin ! No ! Martin ! No ! You said somethin ' about a second chance . Was this it ? The passage of time imprisons us not in a cell of brick and mortar , but in one of hopes dashed and tragedies unaverted . How precious , then , the chance to go back . Only to discover that in facing the past you must face up to yourself . That exiting the prison of time doesn 't free you from the prison of your own character , one from which there is no escape .

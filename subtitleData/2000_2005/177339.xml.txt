 I died at the end of summer . What day ? I can 't remember . Death by fire . That was how I decided to end my life . It all started the day I got lost . I was driving around aimlessly . At least that 's what I thought . In fact , I was looking for you . It was somewhere in the south . But was it really the south ? For you ! " For the praying mantis " " killing the male is a question of survival ... " " Fabre , 1864 " The Feast of the Praying Mantis Who you were , and where you came from was of no importance . You came north with me . That is all that mattered . You seemed happy , even relieved to be far from your home . I built you a greenhouse in the big garden surrounding my house . Everything was so simple back then . Sylvia ? Julien ! Look at this ! See ? I see . And I see you 're not ready . Look closer . It 's in bud . I can see the buds . And I can see we 're going to be late . Let 's go . You don 't get it . It 's going to flower . For the first time . It 'll bloom just as well if you 're not here , won 't it ? We ought to celebrate . Yes . What better way than to go to a concert ? I 'm not going . You can 't stay in this greenhouse . It 's like an oven in here . You can 't breathe . You 've got to meet people , get out and about . You never speak to anyone . I speak to my plants . Excellent conversationalists , I bet . You 're wrong . They have a lot to talk about . Listen . Ah , yes ! They can talk . They 're saying : " Come with me , Sylvia . The concert will be great ... " And Sylvia replies : " Yes , pretty plants . I will come . " I love you . Did you enjoy it ? Yeah . Not bad . I 've seen worse . Ouch ! You 've just shattered a moment of pure poetry ... The cellist was incredible . You say that because he really knows how to use his bow , eh ? Right , I 'm off to climb your mount of Venus . Hey ! What 's the matter ? What 's the matter ? Are you thinking about home ? Is that it ? Know what I feel like ? No ... I feel like a holiday . Tomorrow we 'll pack our bags , and head south . I don 't want to go back there . What do you mean ? Don 't you want to see your mountains ? Your garrigue ? The sun ? There 's too much sun down there . I don 't need that much sun . A little kiss on the cheek ? No ... On the nape of your neck ? Well , maybe . Maybe ? Come on , let 's go to bed . Go without me . And now for the weather report . The coming heat wave could well go down in history . Temperatures will reach record highs , starting today ... How about we up the tempo ? A waltz to wake the old biddies up ? You 're on ! He 's completely reckless ! He 's out of his mind ! That was Patrick . He spent most of his time on the rooftops , chatting up the birds . He had a taste for the extreme that might have made him likeable ... to others perhaps , but not to me . Sylvia ? What are you doing down here ? What time is it ? Don 't tell me you 've been here all day . The sun was too bright . My head was aching . Poor darling ! You 've been in the cellar all day ? My little flower . You 'll wilt if you stay down here . Come on , let 's go out . Hold onto me . How did you do that ? He just wanted to play . Play ? Eat us alive , more like ! No . You don 't get it . He was just pretending to scare you . Well , he managed that alright ! I 've had enough . I 'm going home . Alain . How about it ? Eh ? Wow , it 's great ! Something else , eh ? Like in the old days , eh ? Wait . You don 't mean ... ? Let 's jump . Come on , Patrick . Hand in hand . Together . You can 't do this ! Have we got enough run up ? Come on , snap out of it ! It 's too dangerous . Can 't you feel ... a prickle of ... No . Hey ! What are you doing here ? Haven 't you done enough for one day ? Enough of what ? We 're just getting started . Count me out , pal . Wait ! I 'm coming too . You 're mad . Get off ! Go on , get off . You can 't make me ! Claudine , don 't . He 'll do it ! Not without me ! Get off , Claudine . I can 't do it with you . I 'm fine , OK . Have it your way , bitch ! How could you ? In front of all my pals . Enough of your bullshit , OK ! Never embarrass me like that again , Claudine . Never ! What 's up ? Having a rough time ? He 's like a spoilt brat who 's had his rattle taken away . It 's worse than that ... Oh dear . My sweetheart ! What 's wrong ? You don 't want to sleep with me ? No . It 's not that . Leave me alone tonight . Alright ? Our bed 's big . I won 't touch you . It 's not that ... Just for tonight , OK ? Alright . Goodnight . I mean to say ... What ? I found you in the cellar yesterday . What do you want on your toast ? Apricot , or strawberry ? Then there was that mad dog ... He wasn 't mad . Yes , I know . He was just playing . You should try the apricot jam . And you , Sylvia ? What were you playing at ? Putting him under my spell . It worked . Just like with you . Of course ... What I saw is ... Never mind what I saw . Here ! Eat this . I 've put strawberry jam on it . Hurry up ! You 'll be late . Jean will be cross with you again . Let him get cross . I don 't care . I 'm staying with you this afternoon . OK ? No way ! Why did I leave ? I was determined not to leave you alone . You weren 't well . Strange things were happening ... But my resolution seemed to fade away in an instant . I was supposed to be going to Jean 's . But I went the other way . With no particular aim in mind . Shit ! Mister ? Mister ? Mister ? No ! Are you crazy ? Wait ... Hey , take it easy . I fell because of you , and look at how you treat me ... Because of me ? No , please . It hurts . Let go of me ! Please wait . I 'm badly hurt . You must take care of me . I 'm not a nurse . Fuck you ! Asshole ! Hey ! Wait for me . I 'm in pain . Terrible pain . Hi , there ! Patrick ! Alain ! Supplies ! What are you doing here ? I 've brought the mortar . Where 's Patrick ? He 's not here . I mean , he 's gone . Gone ? What do you mean , gone ? He 's gone , that 's all . But he knew I was coming . Where did he go ? I don 't know . Shopping maybe ... Alain ... You know him . He forgot . Yes , I know him . He forgets when it suits him . Get out ! Let me in . I won 't eat you . Go away ! I didn 't come all this way for nothing ... Oh yes you did , asshole . You 're crazy . You could have killed me . Oh dear ! So you 're having me on ? No , not at all . Not exactly a warm welcome . Nice house . A bit gloomy , but ... What a welcome ! What an attic ! Very nice . I 've never ever seen such a great attic . And attics are my specialty . I love attics . I always enter through the attic ... You should use the door . It 's more polite . Oh no ! Not that , not that ! It 's too pretty . I may not be polite , but I do appreciate pretty things You 're right though . Polite people introduce themselves . Pleased to meet you . I 'm Patrick . Who is this guy ? Stop it ! Are you crazy ? Get out of here ! Hello ? Hello , Jean ? It 's Sylvia . Is Julien there ? Yes , he 's here . I 'll hand him over . No , don 't bother . Tell him ... Just tell him ... I love him . Hello ? Hello ? What did she say ? That she loved you . What happened ? Did you have an argument ? Something like that , yes . It 'll blow over . She said she still loves you . Here . She was ... She was with another man . What did you say ? You heard me ! You just up and leave ? You leave the other guy to it , like a jerk ? No . I slapped her . So you slapped her ! So what ? I 'm sure you wore kid gloves . Poor little thing . She 's so fragile . You have to be easy on her . Pretty little hothouse flower . But if I were you I 'd have blacked both her eyes , then sent her back , where she came from . Where are you going ? I 've had a few girls in my time , but never one as warped as you . What was all that carry-on ? What carry-on ? Oh , nothing . Your man comes home , to find us fucking . You send him packing , then you phone him , to tell him you love him . Nothing much . Everything 's fine . Just fine . That 's the way things should be done ! What exactly are you looking for ? Nothing . I 'm not looking for anything . You 're the one who 's looking for something . That 's a good one ! So , tell me ... what am I looking for ? Me . And you 've found me . Was I running away ? Was I leaving the field clear for Patrick to steal you away from me ? That wasn 't it . I drove south to try to understand , to go back to that first moment , that first look . I wanted to find the place , the roadside , where it all began . The further I moved from my everyday life , the nearer I came to you . I was an explorer , discovering a mysterious land . A world where dream and reality became one . I was entering your world . I was entering the unknown . Is that you ? Where did you spring from ? The guest room . You needed to rest . And now , you need to build up your strength . What happened last night ? Nothing special , why ? So , playing with glow worms all night is nothing special for you ? Glow worms ... ? They were flying all around you . And they were spinning round you . You must have had too much whisky ! It can give you nightmares . I never dream . Everybody dreams . Ciao , Giorgio ! He 's not here . When did he leave ? He didn 't come in . He slept somewhere else , you mean . I hope nothing 's happened to him . Yeah , right . Same old story : He 's either with someone else , or he 's in the hospital . But he 's not in the hospital , is he ? Hello ? Yes , it 's me . What 's wrong ? Your voice sounds funny , not like your normal self . Something very important has happened . I 've got a new contract . No , wait , this one 's something special . She 's crazy and she 's hot . I 've never seen anything like it . She 's got it all : Money , an incredible house , she 's a real looker ... She says I 'm her stallion . Nobody ever said that to me before . She 's out of this world . It 's fucking amazing ! Listen , you 've got to do something for me . If you see Claudine , smooth things over , OK ? I haven 't seen her for a while . Tell her I passed by the bar , that I send her my love . Tell her I 've got a lot of work , that I love her , that I 'm thinking of her ... You get the picture , don 't you ? Yeah , right . I 'll tell her . A new contract , right . That 's it , very good . That 's exactly it . OK . I 'm a lousy bastard . So what ? So nothing . You 're absolutely right . I give you this ... And you give me that ! He says he 's got a new job . Is this job darkor blonde-haired ? He didn 't say ... Bastard . I made a right mess of that , didn 't I ? Don 't worry . I knew as soon as I saw your face . What can I do ? I 'm not his father , just his landlord . That 's enough for me . Sit down . Let 's have a drink . I 've already been jilted , I might as well become an alcoholic , too . This is the good stuff . Thanks . You 'll have a drop , won 't you ? Just a drop , then . I 'm sorry about earlier . You 're sweet . It doesn 't do any good , but you 're sweet . I wish I could do more , but I 'm not sure you 'd want me to . I didn 't realize . What didn 't you realize ? What a bummer ! You 're in love with someone who doesn 't love you . And I 'm in love with someone who loves no one , not even himself . It 's enough to make you blow a fuse . Hello . Hello . You 're exactly as I imagined ... Excuse me ? But you don 't know me ... Yes , I do . You knew I would come ? I 've been waiting for you for a long time . Had I gone back in time ? Or was it a waking dream ? I had no idea . I no longer knew where I was , when I was . But I knew that it was here , at the very place of our meeting , that I would find the answers to my questions . What did you want ? What were you asking of me ? You needed me . All of me . To really love you , I must hold nothing back . I came back to you , willing to give you everything . Nothing would remain of me . Oblivion . Wait , wait . Give me a break , will you ? No . You had a contract , remember ? Back to work ! Poor jerk ! Bastard ! You 're not up to it when the real work starts , are you ? Hey , calm down . I 've had enough of this crap . An angel . I was carrying an angel in my arms . An angel whose wings had been clipped . I was like a tightrope walker , high above a deep abyss . I must not fall . I must carry Sylvia to safety . So she could live again . My God ! Let her live ! You 're here . I 'm glad . Stop ! Stop it , Julien . Please ! Why ? You don 't understand . You 're wrong . I don 't understand everything , but I know ... And you still came back ... I 'm ready . No . No ! No , not you ! Stop . Stop ! Then there 's only one thing to do . Get you someone else . But it 's the worst thing you could ever ask of me . I ask nothing of you , Julien . You have already given me more than enough . I 'd like to talk to you . Can 't it wait ? No , it can 't . Come down , please . We 've met before , haven 't we ? Maybe . I know what brings you here . I fucked your woman . I didn 't force her , pal . She came looking for me . Keep the bitch on a lead if you don 't want her fucking around . It 's over between her and me . Get it ? Over ! Case closed . But if there 's a problem between you and me ... Yes , there is a little problem . OK , let 's sort it out right now ... Not like that . That wouldn 't solve anything . What do you want , then ? You must come back . Is that all ? You want me to come back ! That 's right . I get it . You get off on seeing me fuck her ? You like it when ... ? Is that it ? I won 't be there . What ? I won 't be there . No doubt about it . You 're both completely crazy . You 're worse than she is ! I don 't care what you think . Come back . That 's all . Don 't talk to me like that ! I don 't want to come back . Why the hell should I ? For her . She 's sick . What she needs is a psychiatrist . I don 't mind she 's sick . A psychiatrist ? Doctors can 't help . She needs you . Don 't you get it ? She needs me ? She 's sick . She 's slipping away . She 's going to die . It 's over between her and me . Get it ? Over ! I don 't give a shit about your girlfriend . OK ? You 're lying . You 're lying . Look at me . You 're scared of her . Me ? You don 't dare come back ! Let go of me ! I 'm scared of her ? Me ? Yes ! Scared of her ? You 're a coward . No , you are . Keep an eye on your whore ! You 're just a coward . Here , have an apple , peasant ! What did you do on Saturday , Alain ? Guido took me to a lousy party . The theme was " pigs in space " ! Any women ? Yeah , all disguised as Miss Piggy . Yuk ! There 's a new club opening . Yes . La Discoteka . When ? On Saturday . Fancy going , Patrick ? Patrick , the new club opens Saturday . Fancy going ? Patrick ? Can you hear me ? Do you want to go or not ? Are you with us ? Ate shit for breakfast , did you ? Patrick ? Get the fuck off my back , Alain ! I knew I would find you here . You 've got somebody else , haven 't you ? Leave me alone , Claudine . My head 's fit to burst , I swear . Don 't worry . I won 't make a scene . It 's not my style . I know it 's not . I don 't know what she 's done to you , but you 're in a fine state ! That 's part of it ... But it 's not what you think . I know you 're crazy and a skirt-chaser . I prefer it when you 're with another woman . At least then I know you 're not in hospital . Don 't even try to understand . Leave , now . I mean it . Please . You don 't understand . I can 't bear it anymore . I spend hours sitting by the phone , wondering if I 've really lost you . Tell me straight ! Is it over ? Sylvia ? Sylvia , can you hear me ? My love , please answer me . I won 't let you down . I 'll find someone else . Then you 'll come back . Hello . Do you mind if I sit here ? Please do . Can I offer you a drink ? No , thank you . I 'm fine . I wanted to ask you something . Anything you like . It 's not easy . I know . It 's always hard at first , but you 'll get used to it . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Pity ! I can 't sleep , Georges . That 's not like you . You 're usually snoring fit to wake the dead by now . I snore ? Like a pig ! Ask Claudine . Give me a break . Pour me some of your special stuff . The strong stuff ? OK . Excellent choice ! Does this insomnia have anything to do with your new contract ? I 'm in a real mess here , you know . I don 't understand this girl . Everything 's different with her . When I 'm with her , I feel like a stud . When we make love , it 's great . Sparks fly . When it 's over everything calms down . She spoils me , strokes me , brings me breakfast in bed . The whole caboodle . Everything to make me happy . When everything 's going fine , when I feel , not exactly in love , but ... you know ... she suddenly blows a fuse . She attacks me , pulls my hair . She strangles me , hits me ... It 's as if she 's possessed . I don 't understand what she wants . Usually when that happens , I just leave . I don 't want to hang around . I just grab my things and go . But not with her , Georges . Why can 't I sleep ? She 's inside my head , inside my brain . She 's everywhere . I can 't shake her off . She 's always there . Giving me a hard-on night and day . She 's a bitch , no mistake . A real bitch . Poor you . This is true passion , isn 't it ? You 've got it bad . You 'll see , you 'll get over her , like all the othe But there 's someone else you 'd do better not to ignore . Who do you mean ? Are you interested ? Yeah , right . How much ? It 's free . Free my ass . Got the clap , has she ? I don 't get it . Claudine is a great girl . I know she is . I know . You know she 's great but you still let her down . I 'm not letting her down , Georges . Stop saying that . I don 't understand you . She 's got everything you need . Doesn 't she mean anything to you anymore ? She 's a great girl . She 's fine . I know she 's great . Don 't tell me how great she is . She 's my girl . You say that , but you let her down . Forget what I just said . Make yourself useful . Give me a refill . This won 't have a happy ending . You won 't live long ! Live long ? Why would I want to ? Seriously . What for ? Let go of me ... Shit ! Get out ! You 've come back ? I just happened to be passing . I felt peckish so I came to see you . Let 's go . And we 're off ! Wait , wait ... Playing tricks on me , eh ? Did you hurt yourself ? You 're alright ? Ah , you can breathe here . You can really fill your lungs . Look . What ? It 's beautiful . Doesn 't it make you want to ... Want to what ? Bite into it . I don 't like the look of it . Are you scared ? No , but stop ... Tasty ? I 'm not very hungry . Sylvia ! Spit it out , Sylvia . Open up , open up ... Shit ! I told you not to touch it . Oh shit ... spit it out . Please , open your mouth . Goddamn it ! Come here . What now ? That way . We 'll never make it through . Go for it ! Where is he ? Where the hell is he , Alain ? What do you think ? Do you know something ? You both get on my nerves . You deserve better than this . Wake up ! Do I know this girl ? Who is she ? I 've only seen her once . What 's going on ? How should I know ? I 've had enough too , Alain . I just want everything to work out . I love Patrick . Get it ? No , I don 't . Fuck you , then ! I didn 't push him into it . He just went . Went where ? Where the fuck is he ? She lives near the site . What are you doing ? We 're going there . Take me ! What difference will it make ? None at all ... I didn 't invite you in , Johnny . Did I invite you in when you burst into my place like a madman ? Stop that crap . Who gives a damn ? I brought this back for you . You needn 't have bothered . I 'll never play again . Never thought I 'd hear you say that . What 's wrong ? What 's it to you ? I don 't want to play anymore . Find another partner . What ? We 've been playing together for years . We 've been through shit together . We 're like brothers , and all you can say is : " Find someone else " ? It 's a pity Sylvia is so busy . I 'd like to thank her for her role in all this . And maybe spit in her face while I 'm at it . She 's unfaithful to you , and all you do is run away . She 's out there fucking in your greenhouse , and you do nothing . You 're dressed up like a prince . Are you going to play a serenade for them ? You 're finished . You 're nothing but a worm ... A worm dressed up like a butler . Get the fuck out of here . Message received , loud and clear ! Snow . Snow . You wanted this white summer , this hallucinatory pureness . It was beautiful . It was good . The party could begin at last . The show would be magnificent . You had given him everything he wanted . My God , how I envied him ! I envied him for having gone all the way with you . I wanted the same . To go with you to journey 's end . No matter what theoutcome . Patrick ! You could no longer live among us . So , we left together . I to oblivion , you elsewhere ... Forever elsewhere . Stop , you rogue !

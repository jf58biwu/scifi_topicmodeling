 Almost home now , Jason . What do we say ? Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me . Keep your chin up , son . We 'll get through this just fine . Have you got a comment ? How do you feel , Jason ? Come on out , you 're safe now . Stay in front of me . We 'll get you in your house . - Come on , son . - Just stay in front of me . There you go , sweetheart . If you need anything during the night , if you don 't feel well , you just ring that bell , OK ? - OK , Mom . - Goodnight , Jason . I know you 're afraid . Maybe you think those people outside are right , that we should take you to the hospital and let the doctors treat you . We could do that . and they might take away your cancer and your body might feel better . But not your soul . It 's God Himself who gave you this illness , Jason , for reasons that are His . If you are to be well in body and spirit , it 's God who must come to deliver you . Good morning . Here 's a story to warm the cookies of your heart . 11-year-old boy diagnosed with lymphatic cancer , cured with a miracle . - Jason McPeck . Goochland , Virginia . - Yeah . Yeah , his parents refused treatment on religious grounds . His faith forbids medical aid , and so Jason 's cure was delivered by angels . Spontaneous remission isn 't completely unheard of . So-called miracle recoveries with no clear cause or reason . It 's not the miracle I 'm suspicious of . It 's the messenger . This came anonymously from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . - DARPA . - Someone at DARPA . How 'd you hear about it ? - You subscribe to the Goochland Guardian ? - No . This appeared miraculously on your doorstep ? Seems I was the only one to whom it was delivered . - Someone wants us on this case . - It 's not a case . Not yet . I 'm gonna go back over to DARPA . You see what else you can find out about that boy . I just gotta know whether it was Roma Downey or Della Reese . - Yes ? - Hi . I 'm Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Are you Mrs McPeck ? - What can we do for you ? - I 'm here about your son . - Are we under investigation ? - No . I was just hoping to better understand what happened to him . May I ask , is he OK ? Jason ? You 've got somebody to see you . - Tell her how you feel . - I feel good . Just a little out of breath . You 're looking at God 's work . Jason 's life owes to His grace and exalts His name in the highest . - Praise the Lord . - Praise the Lord . - And you say that you saw angels ? - Yes . May I ask what they looked like ? They looked like men . They came from the sky in a ball of light . - And what did they say ? - They said not to be afraid . Then one of them pinched me kind of hard . And then I was better right away . - He pinched you ? Where ? - Right here . - What are you doing ? - God 's work , what else ? Get out of my car ! I hoped for more accommodation toward the man who saved that young boy 's life . - And yours . - You got your light . Now get out . You 're not at all curious about the chip that 's been put in that boy 's neck ? You , a medical doctor , who has the same technology in your body , who 's witnessed this wondrous miracle first-hand ? I 've taken considerable trouble to prove my intentions . The newspaper at your door , the email to Mulder . the elaborate demonstration of curing this boy 's cancer ? You see , I 'm dying myself . A dying man who wants to make right , to share his secrets , to bequeath this cure to millions of others like that boy . - So you want to give it to us ? - To you . Agent Scully . I 've tired of Mulder 's muleheadedness , his foolish ideas of overthrowing the system . - You think I 'm fooled by this ? - I made you my offer . Agent Mulder hears a breath of this , rest assured I 'll rescind it . Take it to my grave . - Agent Murphy here . - I need a trace on a DC phone number . I need an address . Thank you . - May I help you ? - I 'm sorry . I made a mistake . May I see some identification ? Is this necessary ? I walked through the wrong door . Your identification , please . - Look ... - Third floor . Agent Scully . Please , sit . - I 'm glad you came . - You obviously knew that I would . I know you 're a doctor and a woman of compassion . Please . In the end ... when a man finally looks at the sum of his life to see what he 'll leave behind ... Most of what I worked to build is in ruins . And now that the darkness descends . I find I have no real legacy . What are you dying of ? Cerebral inflammation , due to brain surgery I had in the fall . The doctors give me just a few months . So you want to use me to clear the slate ? To make you a respectable person ? It won 't work . How many people in the world are dying of cancer ? And here we are wasting time with the past . I 'm here . Where is it ? This miracle cure of yours ? We 'll need to take a trip . - It will require a few days . - I 'll get back to you . I have access , Agent Scully . I have these miraculous chips , but the genetic research that makes them work is closely guarded . There are men in this building who would kill me if they knew what I 'd offered you . They 'd kill you too , in the blink of an eye . I 've destroyed a lot of things in my life , including the people most precious to me . All I want is a chance to do something in service to man before I go . Call received , 8.01 p.m. Mulder , it 's me . I 'll be out of town for a day or two . It 's a family emergency . I 'll call you when I can . I 'm not in right now . Leave a message after the beep . Scully , it 's me . Pick up if you 're there . Scully ? You there ? I got your message and I hope everything 's OK . I 'll try you on your cell right now . You 're going to smoke ? - It 's time I quit . - Just like that . No sacrifice is purely altruistic . We give , expecting to receive . What exactly is it you expect to receive ? Your trust . You question my sincerity . You think I 'm heartless . Would it soften your opinion of me if I confessed that I 've always had a particular affection for you ? My intentions are honourable . I have affection for Mulder too , but ... my affection for you is special . I held your life in my hands . Your cancer was terminal and I had a cure . Can you imagine what that 's like ? To have the power to extinguish a life or to save it and let it flourish ? Now to give you that power , so you can do the same . Yeah , she said it was a family matter . Dropped off the key , asked me to water the plants , no biggie . A great girl . Independent as they come . - But a great girl . - Yeah , yeah . Tenants like an FBI agent in the building . It gives them a sense of security . - Do you know many people died in there ? - We don 't talk about that . You said she carried a suitcase . Notice anything else ? - Anything abnormal ? - No . No . It wasn 't her carrying the suitcase . - It was her driver . - Her driver ? Yeah . Older guy . Tall . I 've seen him here before . Smokes like a chimney . Don 't you want ... ? You 've been at the wheel too long . Would you like me to drive ? I might , if you let me know where we 're going . Knowing that , you 'd feel comfortable ? You 'd trust me ? How long did it take Mulder to win your trust ? - I 've always trusted Mulder . - You 're not being honest with yourself . Think back to when you feared for your future , for your career , when you were first partnered with this man . I told you , I 've studied you for years . And if you would permit me . I 'd like to make an observation . You 're drawn to powerful men , but you fear their power . You keep your guard up , a wall around your heart . How else do you explain fearless devotion to a man obsessed , and yet a life alone ? You 'd die for Mulder , but you won 't allow yourself to love him . Wow . I 'm learning a whole other side to you . You 're not just a cold-blooded killer , you 're a pop psychologist as well . I 've been a destroyer all my life . Before I die , I 'd like to prove that I 'm capable of something more . - Turn here . Left . - Where are we going ? To show you what I 'm capable of . Her name 's Marjorie Butters . She 's got quite a green thumb . - Plays a mean game of Scrabble . - And what 's her relationship to you ? How should I put it ? You could say that I 'm her angel . Marjorie 's 118 years old . - Marjorie ? - Hey ! - I thought I 'd surprise you . - I look an absolute wreck . I 've been trying to get in some bulbs before spring . Marjorie , this is Dana Scully . She 's a very good friend of mine . - Nice to meet you . - My pleasure . Come inside . I baked some fresh bread this morning . And there are tomatoes from my garden and cantaloupe and we 'll have some tea . To have this power ... to visit this woman and see her joy . It must be why you became a doctor . I 'll expect your call . Thanks . She requisitioned a fleet sedan when she left . There have been no fuel charges . Her mother knows nothing about an emergency . You 're worried about the company she 's in , but from what you 've told me , it 's not like she sneaked out . She went to a lot of trouble to allay your fears . I know she can take care of herself , it 's just not like her to lie to me . That 's my private line . - Skinner . - Sir ? - Agent Scully , where are you ? - I 'm on the road . - I 'm sorry to call you on this line . - It 's all right . It 's just we 've been worried about you . Everything 's OK . I just wanted you to express that to Mulder . - He 's here . Why not do it yourself ? - No , sir . That 's all right . Can you tell him that I 'll call him later ? Just tell him that I 'm fine . She says she 's fine . She 's in trouble . I 'm going to the rest room . Mulder , I trust you 'll make sense of what 's on this tape . Right now I 'm protecting you . Please understand that I weighed the risks . I couldn 't divulge this without risking it and I promise you I weighed everything . Our current location is northbound on the Upstate Expressway . We 're driving my FBI fleet sedan . I promise I will get these tapes to you as fast as I can . Whoa ! Excuse me . Lifesaver ? May as well get comfortable . We 've got a good drive ahead . - It 's the masters of disguise . - Can we laugh it up inside ? We got heat on our tail . We did as you asked , got what we could on Scully . First , her credit cards , to see if she purchased any airline tickets . Ended up hacking into a defense department node . They demanded we identify ourselves or be prosecuted for crimes against the government . What 's this to do with finding Scully ? In her computer , we found a series of deleted transmissions . Email that was erased from her subdirectories , but not her hard drive . - A series of communications . - From " Cobra " . Who the hell is Cobra ? Scully would have told me about him . Looks like she 's gone to great lengths to keep this from you . I don 't believe that . She knows I 'd find her no matter what . Mulder , we can 't find her . There 's nowhere to start looking . Yeah , I don 't believe that , either . Give me that . How do you take your coffee ? Unadulterated , thank you . - You drugged me . - I did nothing of the sort . How did I get out of my clothes and into bed ? I carried you . You 'd been up for over 30 hours . You were delirious . I only wanted to make you comfortable . - Where are we ? - Milford , Pennsylvania . That wasn 't part of the deal . I don 't know what you 're up to . Keys are in the ignition . You 're free to go , of course . Choice is still yours . - Sir , I need your attention . - Is my assistant ... ? She 's not at her desk . I wouldn 't bust in here , but it 's a breaking situation . - What 's going on ? - My question exactly . - I believe we 've all met . - Is this place secure ? - Is it secure ? - Don 't get testy , G-man . Are you aware of a federal fugitive , code name Cobra ? For six months , Cobra 's emailed Scully from the Department of Defense where he works on a shadow project for advanced research . - Shadow project is right . - Where he works , shadows have shadows . - Is that what I 'm looking at ? - No , - It 's Scully 's correspondence back to Cobra . - She has a relationship ? No . Somebody posing as Scully hacked into her computer and has captured all her email , passing themselves off as Scully in order to win Cobra 's trust . The last five exchanges hinted at meeting to exchange information on the project Cobra 's working on . - A meeting ? Where ? - Don 't know . They just ended . Who 's been in her computer ? Smoking Man , or someone working for him . You gotta get to him now . You know that you just don 't get to him . If you don 't get to him , it may be the last time we see Scully alive . We 'll get final instructions from our contact tonight . He 's invited us to dinner . I took the liberty of getting you something to wear . It 's ... it 's beautiful . I 'm glad you like it . I look forward to tonight . - So , your contact 's going to join us ? - I presume so . You extol our great trust , but you still haven 't told me who he is . He is to human genetic science as Oppenheimer and Fermi were to the advent of nuclear warfare . I 'm still not clear what my importance is to this exchange . This man , we 'll call him Cobra , he needs assurances that the science he 's gonna hand over won 't fall into the wrong hands . I 've told him of you . He 's expecting to meet you here . Well . To the future . I must tell you something else . Something that 's so unbelievable , so incredible ... that to know it is to look at the entire world anew . - What ? - What we are being given ... it 's not the cure for cancer . It 's the holiest of grails , Dana . It 's the cure for all human disease . How ? It 's from that final frontier . It 's largely extraterrestrial . Then you would be cured . That which makes miracles ... can also make great evil . There are those who would use this power for their own purposes . To choose who will live and who will die . Theoretically , I can be cured . Everything I 've told you about wanting to make right ? I 'm a lonely man , Dana . Would you excuse me ? Cobra hasn 't shown . - What do you want to do ? - Wait . What else can we do ? What trust you 've won ... Scully won 't stick around for ever . What 's wrong ? Just do your damn job . Calico inlet 's 15 minutes out . South end . - What do I do when I get there ? - I don 't know . Just wait . Be careful . Finally we meet . You 're just as you described yourself . Certainly more so last night at dinner . I only wish we could continue to correspond , but it must end after this . I hope one day we can take some time , when I 'm not a marked man . This is it . The science I promised you . Wait . Where did you get this ? Where did it come from , this science ? - Where did it come from ? - Who developed it ? - Scully ? - Yes , I 'm Scully . But we haven 't spoken before , or corresponded . They shot him . They killed him . And they shot at me . - Did you get it ? - You told me no one else knew about this ! I wouldn 't have sent you if I thought there 'd be any danger . Dana ... Yes , I got it . Forgive me . Here , take it . This is for you . I gotta go . Go . - There 's nothing on it . - It 's empty . - Completely . - No . It can 't be . It can 't be . It 's got to be on there . He was here ! These were his offices . - What the hell is this ? - He used you . Mulder , he laid it all out for me . I recorded it . I mailed you the tape . This old woman , Marjorie Butters . I met her . I saw her pictures , her birth certificate . You saw what you needed to see in order to make you believe . Well , then , what about this boy ? This boy with cancer ? You can 't deny that . That 's undeniable proof . Even if we got his parents to let him go with us , how long before that chip in his neck mysteriously disappears ? This was the perfectly executed con , Scully . The only thing I can 't figure out is why you 're still alive . Mulder , I looked into his eyes . I swear what he told me was true . He did it all for himself , to get the science on that disk . His sincerity was a mask , Scully . The man 's motives never changed . You think he used me to save himself , at the expense of the human race ? No , he knows what that science is worth , how powerful it is . He 'd let nothing stand in his way . You may be right . But for a moment , I saw something else in him . A longing for something more than power . Maybe for something he could never have . I made this !

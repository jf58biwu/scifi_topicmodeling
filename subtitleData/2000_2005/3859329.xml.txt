 Well it looks impressive Challenger ... but is it really going to work ? Oh ye of little faith . You know Roxton the windmill is one of the oldest and most reliable ... ways of harnessing the incredible energy of nature . Mozart . Electricity . You 're bloody brilliant Challenger . Have I ever told you that ? Not as often as you should . Does this mean we 'll soon have electric light at the treehouse ? As soon as we finish that high voltage fence we started last year . Finally a good night 's sleep . It looks like we 're in for a storm . Do you think this is strong enough to face the wind ? Small tropical storm 's nothing . What the hell is that ? The windmill 's created a vortex . I suggest everybody take cover immediately . At the dawn of the last century ... a band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world ... driven by ambition ... secret desires ... a thirst for adventure ... and seeking the ultimate story ... they are befriended by an untamed beauty ... stranded in a strange and savage land ... Each day is a desperate search for a way out of the Lost World Everyone all right , Veronica , Challenger ? Yeah . Some small tropical storm . The storm , what happened to it ? Look there . What is it ? The smoking bird of Rintah . What is it ? Where the devil did that come from ? Roxton don 't shoot it . It 's a gyroplane . Who cares where it came from maybe it can take us home . Don 't you crash don 't you dare crash . I 'll see you all back at the treehouse . Thank you Rintah . A day 's journey into these mountains and I will hold your greatness . Have you ever seen a machine like this ? Well in France during the war they were experimenting with ... one man open cockpit death trap , but this . This is a real Helliplane , capable of vertical and horizontal motion and controlled at that . This is extraordinary . And beautiful . Are you guys all right ? You couldn 't relax around the pool like everybody else . You have to charter a helicopter and go sightseeing . Just be grateful we 're still alive . Tourists ? Dressed like clowns . Sorry to drop in on your valley like this but a little engine trouble ... shouldn 't take much to fix it . Take as long as you like . We 'll give you a hand . Thanks . We were beginning to lose hope of ever being found . What do you mean ? How long have you been lost ? Longer than I care to think about . Why what 's the date today ? June 30th 2000 . Where is the nearest jack ? I have to plug in and get on the net . What year did you say it was ? Two thousand , the new millennium . How long have you been here ? Eighty years apparently . I had a dream that I stand by the side of Rintah and all those who serve me live in glory . There is no Rintah ... it 's just a hunk of metal on a stick . Have you ever seen Rintah ? Or heard his voice ? No But Elab has . Elab 's talking garbage . Is that so ? Yes , smoking birds a waste of time . We should hunt for food women we can trade for weapons . Lead the way . Renegade must die . Anyone else have something to say ? Then let 's go ... the smoking bird of Rintah awaits . Are you saying we 've traveled back in time ? If you really are from the twenty first century . Is this proof enough for you ? That 's incredible . Impossible . Take a look at the aircraft and the clothes . I know but how ? Don 't you see the storm , the lightning ; the explosion . It 's what Professor Einstein would call a tear in the space time continuum . Just like a sci-fi film . You people have just broken the time barrier . Give me a break . Where are we ? Who are you people ? I 'm Professor George Challenger and these are my colleagues ... Lord John Roxton , Edward Malone and Marguerite Krux . We left London a year ago in 1919 . Sweet . No Rob it is not sweet and you , sir , are out of your mind ... you all are . Now look we 've got to get back to the hotel . Hotel sounds nice lead the way . I intent to . What 's that ? It 's a telephone . Help will be here any minute . What 's the matter ? Is the auto club busy the GPS not working ? I don 't get it man . If this is 1920 where are we ? This is an uncharted land . It 's a museum of natural histories and ancient civilizations . It 's a place where dinosaurs still rule . Dinosaurs bonus ! Oh Rob there are no dinosaurs . Every inch of the world has been mapped by satellite . Satellite ? Space craft that circle the earth taking pictures of everything . Satellites just as Edward Hale predicted . Well they must have missed a few places . Sounds like raptors . Don 't panic stick together and head for those trees . Mom ! Dad ! Rob ! Where is he ? Rob ! Rob ! Me Tarzan you Jane . Well it 's nice to meet you Tarzan but my name 's Veronica . Another stunt like that and you 're going to be lunch . So how do we get out of this nightmare ? Duplicate the conditions that brought you here . Fix the windmill repair the helicopter and hope we can generate another ball of lightning . And what are the odds of that ? We 're doomed . I am open to other suggestions . I have one . Before we all start dashing about in time ... as exciting as that may be ... perhaps we should try for something a little less ambitious . Such as ? Fix the helicopter and fly one of us off a plateau . I can send help back for the rest of you It 's not a bad idea . Except for the obvious choice of passenger . Wait . Wait just a minute here what about us ? What if the helicopter gets lost or can 't make it back here ? What if you get killed trying to break the time barrier ? You 're the pilot Mr. Cooper ... what 's your opinion ? I 'd like to help you people ... but were low on fuel so we don 't have many options . My first obligation is to my passengers . To get them home safely . That 's fantastic . Sure is . I mean the moving pictures . My father said it 's the most incredible invention he 'd ever seen . Yeah well this is video even better . Wanna try it ? What do I do ? Okay ... look at the screen and press this button . Okay . This is great ! Do something . Like what ? I don 't know anything . Okay how do I see it ? Press the rewind button right here and hit play . Trouble getting out of bed ? Trouble understanding our priorities . Tell me again why we 're helping these people ? It 's their helicopter for starters . And it could be our only way of ever getting out of here . Then we 'll find another way . A bird in the hand Roxton , remember . Are you sure you never played this before ? It 's a bit like throwing a discus . Ah damn I 'm baked . Very tasty . Baked raw raptors aren 't fussy . It 's okay I 've been keeping my eyes open . I keep forgetting , this place is just so cool Are you cold ? No , cool means great or amazing , like you being from 1920 . Or you , being from the future . What is it ? It 's too quiet . Raptors ? Raptors make noise . What was it ? A man . What ? There are other people here too ? Lots and not all of them are friendly . Come on . So what happened ? There was this blinding flash of light ... the instruments went dead and the engine almost quit ... which could 've been fatal . I mean these things aren 't like airplanes man . The engine stalls and they drop . Yes of course the greatest obstacle to the helicopter was creating enough vertical lift for it to raise its own weight and ... Leonardo da Vinci knew that . That 's right but it took Igor Sikorsky ... to perfect vertical and forward flight . A Russian . No no and American immigrant ... in 1930 . Ten years from now . You remember I told Summerlee this would happen . Since then it 's been one leap in technology after another . In 1969 we 'll put a man on the moon . These days , modern aircraft can pretty much fly themselves . All controlled by a central electric brain ? That 's right ... the computer the greatest invention since the printing press . What a world you live in . Yeah maybe , but it 's nothing compared to breaking the time barrier . Man you 'd be famous beyond belief in the twenty first century . A short visit would be fantastic I 'm sure , but to stay would be cheating destiny . What ? You 'd rather stay here ? No , my future lies back in London at the end of this great expedition when I announce our incredible discoveries to the world . That 's funny I 've never heard of you ... any of you . But surely you must have learned of this expedition at school ? Read about it in books ? No not a word . I 'm sorry . The pilot 's never heard of us . Never heard of us , never heard of the plateau , never heard of live dinosaurs . Do you think that means we never get out of here ? Isn 't that obvious ? No , these people say this place doesn 't even exist . What do they know ? Don 't worry Challenger ... you 'll not be denied your place in history . Not while I 'm alive . Why take the risk ? What do you mean ? What are the chances of them breaking the time barrier ? Compared to our chances of flying out of here ? Marguerite . It 's the law of the jungle Roxton ... survival of the fittest . This may be a jungle Marguerite but we are not savages . Yes not all of us anyway . You act like you don 't care whether we get home are not . All I am saying is it 's better than Rob hanging out in the mall . Look this is not a family picnic Barb . We may be stuck here for the rest of our lives . With you ? I would rather die . Someone better go after her . Mrs. Dillon ! You 're in a hurry . I 'm quite capable of taking care of myself thanks . It took a self defense course back in Chicago . I 'm sure the raptors will be terrified . Greetings neighbors , let 's talk some business . Tell your men to throw down their weapons or you get the first bullet . Welcome to the party Mrs. Dillion . You 're quite the little savage . It came from over there . I 'll go ! One more time drop your weapons . An even trade , the woman for the smoking bird . Your weapons or your life . We do it your way ... the hard and ugly way . Do all the women in the future fight like you . More and more every day . Mainly because there are fewer and fewer men like you . I 'll take that as a compliment . That was more fun than a giant waterslide , very gallant of you to break my fall . My pleasure I 'm sure . What 's going on ? Nothing 's going on ; we slipped and fell . What happened ? Seems like your mother had a little accident . Need a hand ? I can manage . Extremely well by the looks of it . A woman of the future ; quite a catch , very exotic . And very married . Not very happily from all appearances . Trouble ? A band of scavengers , they 're after the helicopter . Better keep a guard on it . Why would scavengers want a helicopter ? They 'll worship it . How 's it going ? The fuel pump is partially blocked . If I can get some of these instruments to work ... we could be in business . Have you ever seen a set of tools like this ? No nothing like it where I come from . The wonders of the 21st century . The more I consider it the more it peaks my scientific curiosity . You 're not thinking of abandoning the expedition are you , cheating your destiny ? My opinion hasn 't changed . But it is possible my destiny does lie in the future . If I was your enemy you 'd be dead . We have problems . The smoking bird has been captured by the enemies of Rintah . We don 't stand a chance against their guns . Not if we fight them in the open but Rintah has given me a plan . We need a hostage . All Phil ever thinks about work . I don 't know what he 's gonna do if we don 't get out of here . At least you 're all together that 's something . I guess so . Rob sure likes it here . He 's the reason we took this vacation in the first place . Rob is very cool . Sounds to me like he 's been teaching use some modern slang . It 's nice to have a friend . You and your husband should spend more time with him . Awesome , this is totally out there . My parents totally loved it here ... especially my father . Your parents must be way cool , unlike mine . They 're not so bad . Are you kidding ? Sometimes I think if I never see them again it will be too soon . Hey , where are your parents ? I don 't know . They were only supposed to be gone a few hours but something happened . And they never came back . Never ? How old were you ? Ten . And you 've never found out what happened ? Someday I will . But if I ever had the chance to travel back in time ... I 'd never let them out of my sight again . Hey Mr. Bodyguard , coming in ? Water 's beautiful . I have to give these palm fronds back to the windmill . You can 't leave me by myself . It 's dangerous out here . I 'll wait here . I love a man with an iron will . Yes . Beautiful isn 't it ? Incredible , do you know what this is worth ? Precisely it 's never been appraised . A diamond this size in the year two thousand this would go for millions . That one belongs to Veronica . But the plateau is filled with precious stones . Unbelievable , I 've never seen stones this size before . These are worth a fortune . Enough to buy a ticket out of here ? But the chopper only holds four people . That 's unfortunate , but which four ? Who do you propose we leave behind ? Well , your son seems to be having a good time . But I 'm sure he 'll want to get back to his friends soon enough . Barb on the other hand . Barb would never agree to stay behind . Are you sure about that ? Do you know where she is right now ? Where is she ? Last I saw . Yes there she is . Is she out of her mind ? Someone 's cooking . One hostage , just one hostage . Rintah will guide us . Hail Rintah ! Rintah ! He will lead us . Guide us . Come on ! Praise thee to Rintah . Well thank you kind sir . Even if you were afraid to get your feet wet . Oh I 've seen the future more than that I can 't imagine . What happened this time ; your bathing suit fall off ? I went for a swim . Yeah , you were naked . Oh you noticed , how amazing . Where 's your sense of decency and self respect ? Now wait just a minute here . Stay out of this . No , you stay out of it . Why don 't you go back to your precious little job in Chicago . Rob and I can stay right here . This is all your fault . Barb ! Barb ! Oh you 're good , very very good . There could be room for you too . You go on up I 'll go warn the others . One sound and it 's all over . Where is this guy ? What 's he gonna do to our son ? Try to trade him for the helicopter I would imagine . That 's what he really wants . Oh my God what are we gonna do ? I 'll find him . I 'll go with you . We 're coming to . You better get back to the windmill to warn the others . Be careful . Oh you also , and fire two shots at the first sign of trouble . I 'll do the same . Got it . How about some water ? How about that ? You 're a real comedian . And you 're alive because I 'm going to trade you for the smoking bird . That doesn 't stop me roughing you up a little . What are you going to do with a helicopter anyway ? The smoking bird is a gift to me from Rintah . My men will carry it with pride . Carry it ? It 's a helicopter ... it flies . It can go up again ? Yeah like a bird up and down tweet tweet . Laugh at me ... I 'll slit your throat . Do you understand ? Looks good better than the first one in fact . Now all we need is a storm . And the rest of the tourists . The helicopter doesn 't leave without them . No of course not . Right Dave ? I bet you 've got family back home . But you don 't mind missing the next storm do you ? Forget it Marguerite ... the helicopter leaves with exactly the same people it came here with . Is that how you feel George ? Malone 's right . You 're sure ? We 'll talk again when the wind starts blowing . It looks like they 're heading back to where Rob and I saw them . Just over that hill . Why are we stopping ? Shhh listen . Oh my God . There he is . Rintah sent the smoking bird to me . The bird can fly and only I can fly it . You need a pilot . I need the smoking bird . Hey , keep your head . There are far too many for heroics . But we 've got guns . And they 'll kill your son long before we get to him . We need a plan . Are you worried about Veronica ? I am worried about all of them , aren 't you ? No , if they were in trouble we would have heard . Two gunshots remember . As if they were close enough for us to hear them . They 'll be fine . Looks like we 're in luck . How long are we supposed to wait ? Oh there 'll be another storm . When ? Don 't your charts say we 're headed out of ... the stormy season , it could be another year . If this animal wanted to bargain for the chopper where is he ? I don 't know . Maybe they 're all dead . They 're not dead . The helicopter holds four ; there 's four of us . You can 't leave them here . This could be the only chance ... we ever get to save ourselves . Phil and I have to be in position before you and Barb make your move . Right . Ready Barb ? Ready Phil ? Phil ? Where is he ? I 'm the one you 're looking for . Damn fool . Who are you ? I can show you how to fly the helicopter . He doesn 't know anything about flying helicopters . He 's just trying to save Rob . Let the boy go free . I 'll take you anywhere you want to go . Dad what are you doing ? Run ! Family reunion , now I really have something to bargain with . Thank you Rintah . You okay ? Yeah you ? Yeah just stay in front of me . I 'll get us out of here in no time . Gee dad I don 't think they take credit cards . Rob . Don 't leave home without it . Is this a private conversation ? We were just talking about teaching you to fly . Someone as smart as you could learn real fast . To bad you can 't . Leave him alone . Remember I only need one hostage dad . Okay I need a couple of minutes . You think you can keep his attention that long ? It will be my pleasure . The wind is really picking up . Remember how fast the last storm blew in . We better get going . We ? That 's right . Well what 's it gonna be George ? The dizzing heights of international fame in the next century ... or the forgotten man of nineteen twenty . Now Marguerite . What are your doing ? We 're going to wait another hour . An hour will be too late . If we miss this storm . Another hour Marguerite . Hey over here ! Nice Dino . Hey handsome , how about you and I am wrestle for those hostages ? Thank you Rintah . I win the hostages go free . And when you lose ? Well then you 'll have three hostages . Come on dad . Not so fast . I 'm telling you that was gun fire . It was thunder . It doesn 't matter times up . Coming George ? Marguerite you can 't just abandon these people and steal their lives . Looks like we 're in for a storm . I hope Challenger has everything ready to go . Are you ready ? I 've been such a jerk . You 're not the only one . Finally you agree on something . Come on let 's keep moving . Come on let 's go . Hurry up Rob . Their not so bad . Tell Roxton not to worry . Marguerite don 't do it . You can 't . Goodbye Ned , goodbye Challenger . Look ! Stop ! They made it they 're back . Looks like we 're just in time . We were getting worried . Looks like everybody made it I see . One big happy family . Thanks for being a man of honor . Next time you may not get off so easily . You better get going . You take care of those cool movies . What are you doing ? We 're only going to get one chance we don 't need it . Well that 's very generous of you . Anyway it makes us a little bit lighter . If we 're less than half the fuel we started out with , we may have room for one more person . None of this would have been possible if it wasn 't for you Challenger . Think what you could do in the twenty first century . Don 't worry about us Challenger . If we find a way back we 'll tell all what you 've accomplished here . And you 'll find a way to come back and get us , right ? The lighter you are the better . You 'll need all the speed you can get when you see the lightning . Stay in front of it and give it all you 've got . Good luck and God speed . Do you really think we 'll get back to the twenty first century ? Don 't worry we 'll get you home safely . Dave 's got it all under control . You can count on me kid . Come on you old work horse . Think they 're going to make it ? There it is . - We 're not high enough . - Yes we are . I can 't believe we 're doing this . Hold on here we go . Look ! - It 's going to run us down . - No it won 't . We 're not going to make it . - Yes we will . - Yes we will . Twenty first century here we come . Mayday mayday mayday this is November two five hotel . November two five hotel this is Caracas . Where have you been ? Do you think they made it ? Oh I hope so . They better not forget us . Could have been on our way to a whole new future . Instead we 've got a tool box ... and a telephone that doesn 't work . Sorry guess I need some practice . Hmmm preferably outside . Cute totally useless . Marguerite catch . Good catch . Any of you athletes want to give us a hand ? [ phone ringing sound ] Quiet quiet quiet Shhh [ phone ringing sound ] what was that ? Did you hear something ?

 I 'm right here , Marisol . Right next to you . Don 't ever leave me . Never . CAINE : What happened ? A car 's blocking the way . They 're not moving . I don 't understand . They 're here for me . I 'm getting out . Sweetheart , I have to get out here . They 'll take you to the hospital , but I 'll meet you there , all right ? You hang in there . We can spend a weekend in the country . It 'll be great . So are you happy with your new husband ? Yeah . Marisol , there 's something I have to tell you . This officer will be escorting you until the trial is over . I don 't understand . These are very , very dangerous people . Anyone connected to this case must have police protection , including families . So this is what remission feels like . I need to remind you that you fought and you won , didn 't you ? Yeah . Listen , tonight I was thinking ... Casa ... Tua ? Casa Tua . Sounds good . Are you up ? I 'm up . See you later ? I 'll see you tonight . Love you . I love you . You , uh ... You don 't let her out of your sight , right ? CSI Wolfe , what exactly is your role in this case ? I processed the firearm evidence on the day the Mala Noches were apprehended . Can you confirm that this was the weapon seized from the defendant Raphael Sifuentes on the afternoon of the shootout at the Quarry ? Get on the ground ! Get on the ground ! Now ! Move ! Move ! Move ! So , Raphael , you and your buddies shot up the cemetery and then broke into the Livingston house . You got some good story there , B. Yes . I can . Thank you . The Prosecution calls Antonio Riaz . BAILIFF : Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ... You 're a Mala Noche member , correct , Mr. Riaz ? Yeah . And yet , you 're testifying against them . Couldn 't that get you killed ? I need to do the right thing . Is this the gun you gave to Mr. Sifuentes ? You 're a dead man , Riaz ! You hear me ? A dead man ! I ask you again . Is this the gun ? I-I-I 'm not sure . You 're saying this isn 't the gun ? No , I-I don 't think it is . But you stated to detectives that it was , Mr. Riaz . Can-Can I see it again ? Maybe , maybe I didn 't see it right . Head 's up ! Security 911 ! Bailiff ! Code 73 . Security , Courtroom 12 , stat . Lieutenant Caine . You help me and I 'll help you . You 're already dead , brother . Join the club . How many people were killed ? Were any of the assailants foreign nationals ? What sort of leads do you have in this case ? Has the bailiff 's family been notified ? Horatio . The fugitives are Raphael Sifuentes and Antonio Riaz , both Noches , both dangerous . Who 's the shooter ? Jose Torillo , farther down the Noche food chain . Frank , it looks like the witness faked testimony to get close to the gun . We put out a BOLO on the escape vehicle . We 're blanketing the city . We 've gotta find them . Great . Eric . Your girlfriend just broke my window . Hey , hey , slow down . What girlfriend ? What window ? My car window . Gloria broke it . You 're sure it was Gloria ? Who else ? She called me the entire time we were seeing each other . She 's , like , the hang-up queen . Somebody might want to tell her about caller ID .. All right , look . I 'm gonna call her and tell her to back off . Well , I dealt with this when we were together . But now ? I mean , seriously , I don 't even know how you put up with somebody so crazy . I 've told you , I didn 't . I went out with her a few times . She 's crazy , I moved on . Well , somebody didn 't give her that message and now she owes me a window . I said I will take care of it . Yeah , I mean , you better . All right , well we know how the gun got in here , but evidence is cleared before it 's stored . So I guess the question is how 'd the bullets get in here ? SWAT checked the courtroom , didn 't they ? Yeah , it was swept immediately before the trial started- - everything was clean . Well , it got dirty . Where was the shooter sitting ? Over there . Packing tape . A loaded magazine was taped under there . Our shooter knew exactly where to find it . BAILIFF : Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth so help you God ? But who put it there for him to find ? Someone on the inside . Let me see the tape , I 'll have Delko check it for prints . Got something ? Yeah . Let 's hope it leads to something else . I heard you 're having girl trouble . Everyone hears everything in this place ? Yeah . Still , is the rumor true ? You remember Gloria ? Oh , the crazy one . She was into Raike massage . Uh-huh , and skydiving . And hunting if I recall . That 's quite a potent combination . Yeah , well it didn 't hurt that she looked the way she did , either . Yeah , well , see that 's the problem . You love crazy until crazy loves you . Well , crazy has messed with every girl I 've been with since . And I think she just busted up Boa Vista 's car . So I 've got to put a stop to it . My advice : talk to her once as Eric Delko . And then ? Talk to her again as a cop . I like you , you 're ruthless . Take a look . It 's from the courthouse employees ' database . DUQUESNE : Alan Parker , the janitor at the courthouse . That 's their inside man . You have to understand , okay . They threatened me . DUQUESNE : A bailiff was was killed as a result of your actions . And that 's so far ; there 's still two dangerous killers out there . They knew my daughters ' names . Their schools , their friends . They said I 'd never see them again . So you cooperated . I had to . Look , all right , I 'm sorry that people got hurt . But I still have a family , okay ? I kept them safe . Who approached you ? Some guy , some Latino guy . Was it this guy ? Um , yeah . Yeah , that 's the guy . It 's Truillo . It 's a dead end . CALLEIGH : How 'd you get into the courthouse after SWAT swept and secured it ? About five minutes into the trial , one of the gallery members got sick . So they cleared the court while I cleaned it . JUDGE : Ten minute recess ; jurors are to remain in the break area pending notification . Five minutes in , that 's not a coincidence . Do you still have what you cleaned up ? Um , yeah . I mean , it 's-it 's still in the janitor 's closet . Could help us find another piece of the puzzle . You 're gonna make me collect that , aren 't you ? Mm-hmm . Rank has its privileges . I came as soon as you called . Gloria , if you 're going to call and bother people , okay , I 'd appreciate it if you just called me . You miss me ? No , I don 't . Well , that 's good . 'Cause what would your wife think ? My wife ? What are you talking about ? Oh , that 's sweet . It still feels weird to say it , huh ? Wife . What , are you crazy ? You see a ring on my finger ? Guy like you won 't wear a ring . Or maybe he doesn 't want to . I saw you at the courthouse . You 've been following me ? Well , I got news for you : that was my sister . She got married . You told me you didn 't have siblings . I didn 't tell you a lot of things , Gloria . You know why ? Because with you , information is dangerous . With me , a lot of things are dangerous . You come near me or anyone that I know , and I 'm going to arrest you . Mm ... So , guess what I found in my pile of puke . Do I have to ? Coal . And ... ? And it 's the active ingredient in ipecac . Ipecac . Induces vomiting . It also confirms that our puker was in on the courthouse shootout . It was a diversionary tactic . So this , my friend , is for you . A vial of bile . You 're too good to me . The force of vomit scrapes the esophagus , taking bits of the puker 's skin along with his stomach content . I 'll let you know if I find a conspirator . Thank you . What ? So you 're the upchuck specialist . Didn 't think we 'd find you , did you , Benito ? Didn 't know you guys were looking . You were at the courthouse today , weren 't you , Benito , helping bust out Sifuentes ? Clear the court . Ten minute recess . I 'm happy to have the rep . Yeah , well , you 're not gonna be too happy where you 're headed . So you want me to snitch , huh ? Like Antonio Riaz ? Where is he Benito ? And Raphael Sifuentes ? Hey , you 'll never find them . So that tells me one thing , Benito . What ? You know where they are . So where are they ? Not saying . Well , then let me tell you where you 'll find yourself- - in lockup , tagged with a rep as a snitch . What ? But I didn 't say nothing . Not yet . I assume you can write . Let 's go . TRIPP : Japanese restaurant ? That 's a good front . Outside of Noche territory . Eric . I-I-I can 't find him . I can 't find Horatio anywhere . Mari , Mari , listen , slow down . Slow down , okay ? I need to get a hold of him . What happened ? Somebody vandalized my car . They , um , they stole my purse . I just ran into the store for a second . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Vandalized how ? They broke my window . Do you think they 're trying to send Horatio a message ? No . No , this has nothing to do with him . It has to do with me . You ? Yeah , it 's personal . I 'll explain later . I want you to take your car to the shop and I 'll call you when I get your purse . Yeah . Okay . Thanks , little brother . Sorry . Gloria . Eric . Two visits in one day . I never understood , Gloria . You got all of this , and you still want to harass me ? Money can 't buy you love . I warned you . Guess we 're both spending the day warning people , huh ? No , you 're threatening people , innocent people . Now , where is Marisol 's purse ? Oh . You 're here for your wife 's stuff ? I told you , she 's not my wife . Then I don 't have her stuff . She 's my sister . All right ? Look , I 've seen you and her together . She has a wedding ring . Her last name 's Delko . I can do the math . Good . Then you can do the time . I 'll let the state attorney know to give you the max . Okay , I 'll get her purse . You want to come in ? Get your checkbook , too . For the window ? Yeah . For both of them . Horatio . Get the warrant , Frank ? Fastest I got one from anybody . Gunfire in a courtroom will do that . MAN ( over radio ) : Surrounding Japanese restaurant . Four suspected Mala Noche gang members believed to be inside . They are heavily armed and extremely dangerous . Repeat , they are heavily armed and extremely dangerous . Team seven to the flank ; watch triangulation and fire . OFFICER : One ... two ... three . ( gunshots ) All clear . Restaurant 's close to the courthouse . Good place to disappear quickly . Yes , and the cigarettes are still burning . And there are the clothes . Someone tipped them off we were coming . Well , it wasn 't Benito . I 've had guys sitting on him since we hooked him up . No phone calls , no visitors . Who else knew ? Only the judge who signed the warrant . Who else ? I don 't know- - clerk , state attorney ? What about the janitor , Frank ? What 's going on ? Cops picked me up , told me nothing . HORATIO : That 's because you 're going to do all the talking , Mr. Parker . Hey , look , why don 't we go inside or someplace else ? What 's the problem ? It 's a beautiful day out here . And it could be your last with the Mala Noches floating around , Mr. Parker . We did some checking . You have no daughters , no wife , which means no one to threaten . All right , all right , it 's true , all right ? I was in it for the money . How did you tip them to us ? Every day , I get cell phone numbers from the Noches . Burners . I call them if I got a lead . I saw your warrant issue- - confirmed copies , clerk 's mail . That was a hot tip ? Hey , listen , guys , all right ? I don 't know where they went- - I 'm telling you . Frank , check his cell phone . MARISOL : Hey . Where 's your protection ? No , I just told him I was going to come see you . You got my purse back . Yeah . Look , I 'm sorry it was taken in the first place . Thank u . Is everything still inside ? Yeah , the motive was never robbery . This girl thought you were my wife . Your wife ? She 's not balanced , okay ? I 'm actually glad that she didn 't do something more serious . Your girlfriend . What ? What 's up ? I thought I saw a glint or something . Eric ! Eric ! Francis . Horatio . Shots were fired ; The Delkos were hit . Mari . Mari , you 're going to be okay . Sit down here , come on . Eric , you okay ? I 'm fine- - Marisol 's been hit . MAN : Lieutenant . Talk to me . Projectile entered her abdomen . It 's still in her . Okay , load her , I 'm going with her . All right , load her . Sweetheart , here we go . I 'm here . We 're going to go for a little ride . Load her ! Let 's go ! Don 't ever leave me . Never . What happened ? A car 's blocking the way . They 're not moving- - I don 't understand . They 're here for me . I 'm getting out . Whoa , whoa , hold on ! I got you . Radio the E.R. Inbound G.S.W. is diving . We have uncontrollable abdominal bleeding . Stay down . Stay down . ( mouthing ) I 'm trying to get this back into you . ' I can 't find a vein ! Inserting subclavian line . Lieutenant . What do you think ? We were able to extract the bullet . It entered her kidney and then penetrated her spleen , but we lost precious time with her . Okay . In some way , I 'm sorry to say , that car was more dangerous than the bullet . What about her chances ? Well , she 's stable right now . ( door opens ) I 'll call you if her condition changes . Thank you , doctor . I can 't believe this , H. Did you call your parents yet ? Yeah . They 're on the way . Okay . Eric ... You get the shooter , I 'll get the driver . You fight , Mari , okay ? You fight . REPORTER : Three members of the Mala Noche gang have been taken into custody for attempted murder . One is still at large , assumed armed and dangerous . WOODS : The city 's going crazy today . Shooting up a courtroom , trying to kill Horatio in broad daylight ? Eric and Marisol ! Most dangerous kind of criminal is the one that doesn 't care . Well , at least they 're down two for two . Yeah , drop in the bucket . How is she , Horatio ? She 's in good hands , Alexx , but thank you for asking . If there 's anything I can do . I appreciate it . Mr. Wolfe , what is that ? It 's a contact lens . The force of the skid must have knocked it out . Maybe that 's why he didn 't shoot at you- - couldn 't see you . Either way , this will have plenty of DNA from his tear ducts . Let 's get it to the lab . I 'll do it right away . How 's your sister ? My parents are with her right now . I just figured I could do more for her out here , helping to find her shooter . All right . Well , let 's get to work and see what we find . It 's most likely a Mala Noche shooter , but we have to follow the evidence . We believe that the shots came from across the street . We found the bullet that grazed your arm embedded in the post . Why , what 's up ? Nothing , I thought saw a glint or something . Bullet traveled at a downward trajectory . What caliber round was the shooter using ? A .308 . It 's a sniper caliber , which expands our search area considerably ... into Noche territory . Judging by the depth and the angle of the bullet , I believe that the shots were fired from an elevated platform . The bullet came from that building . I saw a glint right before the shots rang out . We have to extrapolate from the variables . Depending on the distance , there are several different trajectories . Well , if this is where your shooter was , they never expected us to find this spot . Well , let 's hope there 's more to find . Oh , I 've got something . It 's a woman 's fingernail . Is there any chance the Noches are using female assassins ? No . Those are Gloria 's . I saw them on her today . I 'm going to find her . Eric ? If you find her ... follow procedure , don 't make it worse . Valera . Status on the contact lens ? You were right , it was brimming with DNA . Who 'd we get ? Your guy with the bad vision ? " Memmo Fierro . " That 's the driver . The guy who cut you off . Problem is , there 's no last known address . We don 't need it , we 've got his car . Thank you . I ran a brand check on those cigarettes we got in the car ashtray . They 're Venenos . Salvadoran . These are Panamanian , and these are Bolivian . And this car 's registered in New York . So it looks like everyone 's headed to Miami , and I 'm guessing not for vacation . Not for a vacation , for a Universal , Mr. Wolfe . Meeting of all the Noche heads . It 's why they broke Sifuentes out . He must be a really big deal in the Noches . What is this ? On the front tire rim ? It 's blood . I 'll have DNA confirm it . No , nobody was shot up there . So what is it ? I don 't know , get it to trace . Get out of the car . Get the hell out of the car ! What are you doing here ? Wh you mean is , you thought you got me with that shot , right ? Tried to kill my sister , too ! Now open the trunk ! I didn 't shoot her . Open the trunk ! If you didn 't shoot her , then what 's this ? That isn 't mine . You 're going to tell me you don 't remember showing me that on our first date ? And you used it this afternoon ? ! Hey . You ... you have no proof of that . No , but I will . You know what ? I am beginning to remember why we broke up ! I never forgot ! You were right , the red substance you found on the wheel rim , wasn 't biological . So I ran it through the mass spec . It 's dye . The city runs select tests to ensure that parasites and other foreign substances aren 't transported through our water system . They use it to check flow patterns . So that 's what this is . Came from the sprinkler system . So I called the WASD , and they told me only one part of the county is currently being tested . Star Island . That narrows it down , doesn 't it ? Figured if there 's a Universal , there 's gonna be a lot of cars there . And a lot of heat from those cars . They 'll use a house as a base of operations . Be holed up there probably 24-36 hours . So I had the satellite search for multiple heat sources . Bingo . " 351 Star Island . " Don 't move ! Don 't move ! OFFICER : Do it now ! Hands behind your head ! Hands behind your head ! The party 's over , Raphael . You guys are pretty good . The same can 't be said about you , my friend . TRIPP : Bad idea , Sifuentes . Having that Universal the same day you bust out . Well , you know , time ain 't cheap . Neither is life . TRIPP : As we speak , sweeps are happening nationwide . Noche 's are going down . They can thank you for that . What you still talking to me for ? I want Memmo Fierro . Memmo ? He 's down in Mexico . That 's not true , is it , Raphael ? He ran an ambulance off the road , and my wife may die because of it . Then why ask ? Because you know where he . You tell us , you can help yourself . Got nothing on us . On the contrary , Raphael , I 've got your safe house . Frank . Officer Jessop 's already on it . We 're going to find your compadre . Calleigh , you have anything ? Yeah . I just finished my test fire of Gloria 's rifle . And ? And I was about to compare it to the bullet that we got from the wall . But I can tell you that typical magazine to bolt action .308 holds five rounds . I emptied this one , and I got three . Which is consistent with two shots being fired at you and Marisol . I never thought that it would go from breaking windows to this . Wait a minute . I don 't think she did . Why ? The striations don 't match . This isn 't your gun , Gloria isn 't your shooter . I told you it wasn 't me . My sister 's in the hospital , okay ? And whoever shot her is still out there . I know you were there , okay ? We found your fingernail at the scene . Now , tell me what the hell you saw . Look , I followed you from my house . I was all set up . I had Marisol in my sights , and I ... Look , my mind was just screaming ... .but I couldn 't pull the trigger . And then I heard a shot . I couldn 't believe that that 's what I was thinking of doing . Eric , I 'm so sorry . Stop being sorry , okay , and start being helpful . Where did the shot come from ? Where did the shot come from ? From the right , above me . Did it echo ? Yes . Okay , then it came from a covered balcony . Does that help ? You better hope so . Officer Jessop . That Universal safe house was a gold mine . Found a ton of money and an arsenal in there , sir . Yes , and a .308 , I see . Get it to Firearms , please . Yes , sir . So it was the Noches that shot Mari , huh ? Certainly looks that way , Eric . We got to get them for this . We 're going to get them . Delko . Yes , Doctor . I 'll tell him . Is that the hospital ? Yeah . She 's asking for you . I 'm on my way . I 'm gonna run with this . Calleigh thinks she found where the shooter really was . Eric , wait for me . Don 't be sad . I have dinner plans tonight . Casa Tua ? Casa Tua . 8 : 30 ? 8 : 30 . Did you get the good table ? Got the good table . You , um ... You 're not planning to ... You 're not planning to stand me up , are you ? Never . Should have accounted for the slight variance in trajectory when the bullet grazed your arm . We were off by six degrees . We were looking on the wrong floor . There it is . What ? GSR cone . When a gun like this is fired , the escaping gasses settle . So Memmo was definitely here . Well , they took their gun back to the safe house , but not everything . What is it ? Lo mas dulce de la cana . It 's two boutique-sized bottles of Yarmy rum . Memmo must have tried to calm his nerves . Only one hotel in Miami that uses these as a guest perk . That 's the Marano . That must be where he 's staying . I imagine that you and Horatio are gonna want to take it from here . Yeah . H. Okay . I am so sorry . We got Memmo Fierro . Mm . Tripp picked him up at the Marano Hotel , just like we thought . Let 's go . FIERRO : Hey , let me out of here ! FIERRO ( muffled ) : Hey , let me out ! Let me out of here ! Hey , I confessed already ! CAINE : Come on , let 's go . Memmo , in the unlikely event that I haven 't made myself clear , you deserve to know that this is your last chance . Hey , I already confessed . I shot her . Who put the hit on my sister ? Who gave the order ? Riaz . Antonio Riaz . The snitch that was on the stand today ? Si . He wanted you to know it 's his city now . Memmo , now that you work for me , here 's what I want you to do . I want you to tell Mr. Riaz that I said he 's a dead man .

 PREVIOUSLY ON JEREMIAH ... JUST HEARD ON THE RADIO THUNDER MOUNTAINIS UNDER ATTACK . THERE IS NO DANIEL . HIS IMAGE , HIS VOICE , HIS HISTORY WERE ALL CREATED BY OTHER PEOPLE . I SUPPOSE YOU CAN PROVE THIS . OF COURSE . YOU CAN ASKTO SEE HIM . IN THE LAST 24 HOURS , I 'VE FOUND OVER A DOZEN EXAMPLESOF SABOTAGE . WE 'VE GOT TROUBLE OUTSIDE AND IN . OUR FORCES ARE10,000 STRONG , MARKUS . HOW MANY WILL DIE ON THE DAY OUR TWO SIDES MEET ? THEY HAVE HEAT SEEKERS . SHE SHOT ME . I JUST FIRED BACK IN INSTINCT . YOU KILLED HER . SHE WAS WORKING FOR SIMS . I OUGHT TO KILL YOU ! ( KURDY ) : HE DOESN 'T WANT TOSEE YOU FOR A WHILE . PROBABLY NOTUNTIL SIMS IS DEAD . YOU 'RE THAT FELLOWTHINKS HE GETS MESSAGESFROM GOD . WHERE 'S YOUR GOD NOW , LITTLE MAN ? TELL THE GROUP CAPTAINS WE 'LL MEET AT FOUR ROADS AT DAWN , FRIDAY , AND WE 'LL GO IN . WE 'VE GOT A WAR TO WIN . ( FRANK ) : WITH EVERY PASSING HOUR , MORE TROOPS ARRIVE IN MILHAVEN . SO MANY OF THEM LOOK YOUNG , SCARED , BUT WILLING TO FIGHT TO PROTECT WHAT THE ALLIANCE HAS BUILT ... AND KURDY IS THERE THROUGH IT ALL , A CONSTANT FORCE OF NATURE , WORKING WITH THE NEWCOMERS , ENCOURAGING THEM , GETTING THEM FIRED UP FOR WHAT 'S COMING . AND JEREMIAH , PREPARED TO DEFEND THE TOWN HE DIDN 'T WANT TO RUN , BUT WHICH I THINK , IN HIS WAY , HE 'S COME TO LOVE . OF THE THREE MEN WHO CAME FROM THE MOUNTAIN , ONLY ONE IS STRANGELY ABSENT . YOU SEEN SMITH ? NO , NOT SINCE LAST NIGHT . DAMN . WHAT 'S WRONG ? I DON 'T KNOW , MAYBE NOTHING . I JUST HOPE HE DIDN 'T DO ANYTHING STUPID . SO YOU DIDN 'T SEND HIM OUT ON SOME KIND OF MISSION ? NO , I DIDN 'T . WHY ? BECAUSE HE SAID HE WAS LEAVING TO GO KILL SOMEBODY . YOU 'RE A LONG WAY FROM HOME . I KNOW . IT 'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE A STRANGE DISEASEWIPED OUT ALL OF THE ADULTS AND LEFT US KIDSTO FEND FOR OURSELVES . NOW I 'M MOVING AHEAD , THROUGH THE PAST . * I CAN 'T LET GO * I 'M HOLDING HOPE SO TIGHT * IT 'S HARD TO BREATHE WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD FALLS * * I 'M GONNA PUT THE STARS BACK BACK UP IN THE SKY * * LET THEM ALL JUST SHINE DOWN I 'M GONNA TRY * * I BELIEVE WE 'LL FIND THE WORLD TOGETHER * * THROUGH YOUR EYES * THAT 'S ALL I CAN SEE * I BELIEVE WE 'RE LOOKING AT FOREVER * * IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN BE FREE * * I BELIEVE * GIVEN THE SABOTAGE TO OUR TRUCKS , SUPPLIES , AND EQUIPMENT , THERE 'S NO QUESTION THAT DANIEL 'S MANAGED TO SLIP A FIFTH COLUMNOF ENEMY FORCES INSIDE . IT 'S POSSIBLE THEY CAME IN WITH THE LAST BATCHOF RECRUITS . IT 'S POSSIBLE , BUT THEY COULD 'VE BEEN HERE ALL ALONG . COULD BE ANYBODY . IT 'S ALL DESIGNED TO HELP MAKE SURE WE DON 'T GET OUT OF HERE , AND THE ONLY ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS THAT I DON 'T THINK THEY KNOW WE 'VE FIGURED OUTTHEY 'RE INSIDE . YOU 'RE EXHAUSTED . IT 'S BEEN NEARLY TWO DAYS SINCE YOU 'VE SLEPT . YOU CAN 'T RUN THINGS HERE IF YOU 'RE NOT THINKING CLEARLY . I 'LL BE FINE . BUT YOU 'RE RIGHT , THE LOGICAL PLACE IS TO START IS WITH THE RECRUITS . WORK OUR WAY OUT FROM THERE . LEE , CHECK AROUND , TALK TO ANYBODY THAT YOU CAN TRUST , SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT WITHOUT COMPROMISING WHAT WE KNOW . THAT ADVANTAGE MIGHT BE THE ONLY ONE WE 'VE GOT . SIR ? JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE SECOND UNIT IS IN POSITION . SECOND UNIT ... AH , YES . IT WOULD APPEAR WE HAVEFOUR-WALLED THE OPPOSITION . ONCE OUR FORWARD UNITS JOIN UP AT FOUR ROADS , THERE ISN 'T MUCH THEY 'LL BE ABLE TO DO TO STOP US . THEY SHOULD 'VE ACCEPTED YOUR OFFER TO SURRENDER WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE , SIR . SO IT WOULD SEEM . DANIEL 'S GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY ABOUT HOW YOU 'VE PULLED THIS OUT , SIR , VERY HAPPY . YOU , UM , NEVER DID TELL ME WHAT MARKUS SAID WHEN YOU GAVE HIMHIS LAST CHANCE , SIR . ( MARKUS ) : DANIEL DOESN 'T EXIST . HIS IMAGE , HIS VOICE , HIS HISTORY WAS ALL CREATEDBY OTHER PEOPLE . YOU 'RE IN SERVICE TO A LIE . HE SAID NO . THE REST IS OF NO IMPORTANCE . ANYTHING ELSE ? YES , SIR . WE JUST FOUND OUT MOMENTS AGO , THAT , UM , THEY 'RE SENDING ONE OF THE FOUNDERS . HE 'S COMING HERE TO CHECK UP ON THINGS FOR HIMSELF , SIR . A FOUNDER ? YES , SIR . YOU KNOW , I 'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THE FOUNDERS IN PERSON BEFORE . I 'VE SEEN THE PICTURES , HEARD THE STORIES OF HOW THEY SURVIVED THE DEATH , HOW THEY FOUND DANIEL , AND KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE TO LEAD THE WORLDINTO A NEW FUTURE , BUT I 'VE NEVER SEEN ONE WITH MY OWN EYES BEFORE . HAVE YOU ? ON OCCASION . BUT NOT DANIEL ? NO , NOT DANIEL . YOU CAN GO NOW . SO , KURDY , WHEN DO YOU FIGURE THE BAD GUYS ARE GOING TO BE HERE ? WELL , WE 'RE SETTING UP A PICKET LINE ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM HERE , BUT WE 'RE SPREAD REALLY THIN , MAN . WE DON 'T KNOW WHERE THESE GUYS ARE COMING IN , AND ACCORDING TO MARKUS , WE SHOULD BE MAKING CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY WITHIN THE NEXT TWO DAYS . OOH , THAT 'S NOT A LOT OF TIME . NO , IT 'S NOT . YOU READY ? AS READY AS WE CAN BE , FRANK . GINA SAID YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME . LOOK , MILHAVEN 'S PRETTY SAFE , KURDY . YOU 'VE SEEN TO THAT . YOU DON 'T NEED MEAROUND HERE ANY MORE .

EVERYTHING THAT 'S HAPPENEDIN THE LAST YEAR HAS COME DOWNTO THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS . GUYS , WE 'RE NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND WAIT FOR THE ENEMY TO COME TO US . IT IS TIME TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO HIM . THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS TO FIND SIMS . HE 'S THE GUY IN CHARGE OF DANIEL 'S ARMY . WE GET HIM , IT HURTS THE OTHER SIDE IN A BIG WAY .

YOU SEEM AWFULLY CONFIDENT . JUST STATING THE FACTS . GOOD . DANIEL WILL BE MOST PLEASED . WILL HE ? OF COURSE . GOOD , GOOD . THAT 'S GOOD . PERHAPS WHEN I COME BACK , I COULD HAVE A MOMENT OF HIS TIME . AFTER ALL , LEADING HIS ARMIES TO VICTORY , DEFEATING HIS ENEMIES , REMOVING A PEBBLE FROM HIS SHOE ...

LOOK , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT IS- - DOES ... DANIEL ... EXIST ? OF COURSE . OF COURSE HE DOES . EVERYTHINGALL RIGHT , SIR ? NO , JOHN . SOMEONE JUST LIED TO ME . WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT ?

I 'M GOING TO GO IN , HAVE A LOOK . IF I DON 'T MAKE IT BACK , TELL KURDY WHAT HAPPENED . WHAT ABOUT YOU ? IF I DON 'T MAKE IT BACK , IT 'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I 'M DEAD . OH ...

YOU 'VE BEEN TAKING MY NAME IN VAIN QUITE A BIT LATELY . LIKE THEY SAY , SPEAK THE DEVIL 'S NAME , HE SHALL APPEAR . YOUR TIN-PLATED EXCUSE FOR A LEADER SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED OUR GENEROUS OFFER WHILE HE STILL COULD . WELL , AT LEAST HE 'S REAL . EVERYTHING YOU 'RE FIGHTING FOR IS MAKE-BELIEVE . YOU MEAN DANIEL ? IT DOESN 'T MATTER IF HE 'S REAL OR NOT . IF HE 'S NOT REAL , ALL THE BETTER FOR ME . AT LEAST I CAN GO BACK AND SET MYSELF UP AS THE ONE PULLING THE STRINGS . COME ON , YOU SON OF A FISH ... I GOT A WAR TO WIN ! ( GUN COCKING ) SIR ? YES ? WE JUST FOUND SOMEBODY OUTSIDE . THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO MEET HIM BEFORE WE SHOOT HIM . CERTAINLY . WELL ... I BELIEVE THIS IS JEREMIAH . YOU 'VE MADE QUITE A CATCH . DANIEL WILL BE MOST PROUD . WILL HE ? THESE ARE THE MEN WHO ARE ABOUT TO LEAD OUR FORCES INTO BATTLE ALL FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF SOMEONE WHO , IT TURNS OUT , MAY NOT EVEN EXIST . TELL THEM THE TRUTH . TELL THEM WHAT WE 'VE BEEN ASKED TO DIE FOR . TELL THEM THE LIE . TELL THEM ! I 'D TELL THEM , IF I WERE YOU . HOLD ! HOLD ! LET 'S GO BACK . WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR ? SOMETHING 'S HAPPENING . HANG ON . NOBODY MOVEUNTIL WE GET THE ORDER . OH , JEEZ . OH , MAN . I 'LL GET YOU A MEDIC . IT 'S NOT THAT BAD , FRANK . SEE IF YOU CAN FIND KURDY . I WAS WONDERING IF YOU 'D SHOW UP . I WAS WONDERINGTHE SAME ABOUT YOU . YOU LOOK BAD . SO DO YOU . I TOOK CARE OF SIMS . I 'M SORRY . JEREMIAH ... I 'M SORRY . I KNOW .

LOOK , WITH SIMSOUT OF THE WAY , PEOPLE AREN 'T EXACTLY SURE WHAT IT IS THEY 'RE FIGHTING FOR ANYMORE . THEY TURNED ME LOOSE SO THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY 'RE GOING TO HAVE A WAR OR NOT , AND WHILE THEY 'RE DOING THAT , THEY DON 'T NEED ANYBODYFROM EITHER SIDE DOING ANYTHING STUPID TO START IT . SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE ? THE ENEMY 'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT HILL , AND THEY 'RE WONDERING WHAT THE HELL TO DO NOW . I SAY WE GO TALK TO THEM . TALK TO THEM ? WE 'VE GOT TO START SOMEPLACE . AND IF THEY START SHOOTING ? WE 'LL SHOOT BACK . THERE 'S ALWAYS TIME FOR BULLETS , MY MAN . YOU READY ? I AM . KURDY ? ANYTHING TO SAYFOR POSTERITY ? NO , MAN . IT DOESN 'T MATTERWHAT ANYBODY SAYS . WHAT 'S IMPORTANT IS WHAT 'S BEING DONE . YOU JUST WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU SEE , FRANK . JUST MAKE SURE YOU TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENSHERE TODAY . THERE 'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD BEING BORN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT HILL . HISTORY 'S ALWAYS BEEN WRITTEN IN BLOOD . HOPEFULLY , UNTIL NOW ... MAYBE WE 'LL BE SMARTER . MAYBE WE 'LL FINALLY GET THIS THING RIGHT . EITHER WAY , I WANT TO SEE WHERE THIS BOOK IS GOING . ( JEREMIAH ) : WHEN I WAS A KID , I REMEMBER MY DAD SAYING THAT ONE MANCOULD CHANGE THE WORLD . AT THE TIME HE SAID IT , I BELIEVED IT , BUT IN THE YEARSAFTER THE BIG DEATH , SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY , I JUST STOPPED BELIEVING . ( KURDY ) : IF ONE GUY WITH A BULLET COULD CHANGE THE WORLD IN THE SCHOOL DEPOSITORYIN DALLAS OR IN A HOTEL IN LOS ANGELES , OR MEMPHIS , HOW MUCH MORE COULD ONE PERSONWITH AN IDEA , THE RIGHT IDEA , CHANGE THE WORLD ? ( SMITH ) : TODAY , THIS DAY , THE WORLD WOULDCHANGE FOREVER . NOT BECAUSE OFTHE CLASH OF ARMIES , NOT IN THE CURRENCYOF BOMB BLASTS OR BODY COUNTS , BUT THROUGHTHE PROPER APPLICATION OF THE ONLY FORCETHAT MATTERS , THE ONLY POWERTHAT EVEN GOD RESPECTS- - THE TRUTH .

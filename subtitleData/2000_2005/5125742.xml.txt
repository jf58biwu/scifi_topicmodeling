 Jarod ? Jarod . Danger . Hate ! Hate destroy Jarod ! Very good . Very good . You sound like two angels . And I can 't wait to hear you at the rally . Thanks , Daddy . - All right . I gotta get you two home , okay ? You got a big weekend ahead ofyou . Finish your homework ? I did , but Kati didn 't . - ' Cause I was too busy doin ' yours . Okay , that 's enough of that . We have plenty of time before we go to bed . Okay , let 's hear you practice that song again . Daddy ! - Uh-uh . Practice makes what ? Perfect . - All right , here we go . Very good . Evenin ' , Pastor Jones ! - Daddy ! Listen , gentlemen , I 'd appreciate it ... if you all just turn right around and go back where you came from . That 's not very friendly comin ' from a civil rights leader famous for preaching ' unity ! No , no . It 's okay . - Of course , some of us have a different opinion ... about the world bein ' under one big rainbow and such . Yeah ! - Who are they ? Back inside now ! - I say we show Pastor Jones the light ... the way we see it ! Go on ! - Let 's go . Get down . Get down . Get down ! Get down ! Make ' em stop ! It 's okay . Grab that end ! Set it right here . Make ' em stop ! - It 's okay . It 's okay . Daddy 's here , baby . This is your last warning ! - Nobody wants unity with you people ! Get the hell outta here while you still can ! Why do they do this to us , Daddy ? Why ? Okay , baby . Okay . - I think we made our point . Yeah , I think they get the message this time . There are Pretenders among us . I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and abused . - Life 's a gift . You a doctor ? - I am today . Angelo 's gone postal . He 's going through the evidence from Jarod 's old Pretends , and he 's flippin ' out . The little freak 's possessed . - Has he said anything ? Plenty . But none of it makes any sense . Fire ! Fire ! Like I said , he 's possessed . Fire burn ! Jarod ! Must help Jarod ! Angelo . Jarod . What 's wrong ? - We must save Jarod . From what ? From fire . From hate . Hate kills . Hate will kill Jarod . Must save Jarod . What do you make of it , Syd ? I believe Angelo thinks that someone from Jarod 's past ... is going to try and kill him . Jarod . We must save Jarod ! The question is , who ? I 'd say we learned Pastor Jones a lesson or two tonight ! - Whoo ! Well , a little visual aid always helped my third-grade students get the point . I 'd say a burning cross is a lot more effective than a filmstrip . I guess we showed him the light , huh , Jarod ? If a picture 's worth a thousand words ... a flamin ' cross is worth a mouthful ! It oughta be against the law to have that much fun . In fact , I believe it is against the law . It beats the hell outta selling ' life insurance . I say we go celebrate ! No , nobody 's goin anywhere . Change of plans . Is there somethin wrong ? - While you were all out playin ' , I got a call from the general . The general ? What 'd he want ? He 's comin ' in early . He could be here anytime . So , why 's that change our plan ? 'Cause he 's got a new mission . A bold message . One that 's just not gonna be heard around the country . It 's gonna be heard around the world . That sounds big . - Yeah , it is , Donny . And on account of that , he wants each of you here when he shows up . We gotta stay here all night ? - Wait . We can 't go anywhere ? Until he shows up . Y 'all been recruited from outside the state . The general 's worried you go into town ... and you 'll stand out like a raccoon in a henhouse . Now , I got a little gift here from the general ... he wants us to use to deliver our message . C-4 explosive ? - Yeah . Well , that packs a hell of a punch . Damn right . You 're our demolition expert . You 're gonna rig us up a little device to dis-unify this unity rally ! I 'll tell you somethin ' , boys . When we 're finished , the partying ' ain 't gonna stop . A flag down at 4581 Prospect Street . How long has this craziness been goin ' on ? Several weeks ago , we organized a unity rally . This event 's supposed to bring together ... people from the community from all walks of life . Well , after support grew , that 's when we started receiving ' threats . What kind of threats ? - Warnings . Tellin ' us to call off the rally . - And when you didn 't ? That 's when the acts of vandalism began ... leading ' up to last night . Look , Pastor , the rally 's tomorrow . These types probably aren 't going away . Maybe - Maybe what , Sheriff ? Huh ? Maybe we should just give in , huh ? Give in and just call the whole thing off . No , Sheriff . That 's exactly what they want . Postpone it . Think about your girls . You know , Sheriff , when I was 13 ... I saw a man beaten and dragged behind a truck ... and nobody did nothin ' to stop it . Not even me . That man lived for three days ... the whole time praying ' to die . That man , Sheriff , was my big brother . See , if you don 't fix this kind of hate ... it will destroy everyone that it touches . It 's because of my daughters I gotta do this . So yes , sir . Yes , I will be at that rally tomorrow with my church ... and my family . Any progress ? Angelo senses that someone Jarod brought to justice ... is going to try to kill him . We 're trying to find out who by letting him empath ... various items the Centre recovered from past Pretends . I 'm certainly not surprised someone from Jarod 's past wants to kill him . In fact , that 's a hell of a long line , and it starts behind me . Hey , look . That 's the dress the Black Widow was wearing . The one that Jarod took down for murdering her husband . She certainly has enough reason . And she did try to kill him once . Does he think it 's her ? I want this to be over . I know you do . Jarod ? I love you . Jarod 's in danger ! But not her . Not a woman . Syd , does he even know what he 's doing ? Jarod doesn 't know . Angelo is systematically evaluating and eliminating individuals in Jarod 's past ... with the most intense feelings of hatred for him . Then we need to keep this from Lyle and Raines . They 'll only interfere with Angelo 's progress . Then we 'd better move fast , because , uh , secrets aren 't kept long around here . If Angelo can successfully isolate the potential killer , he can take us to him . And to Jarod ? - Hopefully in time to save him . Even better , in time to catch him . Hey , turn that damn thing off , will ya ? Jungle music . Can 't even listen to the radio anymore without hearing ' that crap . Ain 't you about done with that thing ? About . Just make sure it works . It 'll work . - It better . We 're gonna make this damn unity rally a wake-up call . General says that when the blood of all them sons of Cain ... flows through the gutters , our people will unite . See God 's will to exterminate all the parasites ... who are sucking the life out of this country . Amen , brother . Amen . - Amen . Transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice . I have a dream ! That my four little children - Why do people hate other people because of the color of their skin ? I don 't know , Jarod . It 's called racism . It 's important that you learn what 's wrong in the world ... as well as what 's right . I have a dream that one day - Are they taught to do this ? In some ways , yes . Jarod , there is no simple solution to racism . But there is . Stop hating . It takes time and compassion . Do you understand this , Jarod ? I understand it , but I can 't accept it . - I have a dream - What 's the matter with you , boy ? You look like you seen a ghost . No , brother . Just seein ' the light . There . It 's finished . When we pull this off , you 're gonna score big points with the general . I 'm gonna take this into town ... make sure it 's all in place for tomorrow . I don 't think so . Nobody 's goin ' into town till the general arrives . I don 't wanna make anybody suspicious . I 'll take care of this from now on . You want somethin ' to do , finish reloading ' those shotgun shells . Now , wait a minute . The plan was that I would set any explosives that we used . Well , the plan changed , hotshot . General 's orders . He wants this set special . He wants the preacher 's girls to be the message . He wants us to kill them ? Yep . He 's gonna put an end to this unity crap once and for all . I have tried every possible avenue to contact Jarod . No response . - Sydney , I think Angelo 's on to something . I hope he doesn 't find the bullets . The gun belonged to a mid-level thug-a Joey Melino . Killed an undercover cop . Jarod sent him away . Word from prison is , Joey 's not too happy about it . Maybe he 's paying someone to kill Jarod . Angelo , what is it ? There is danger ! Death ! Hate ! Hate getting closer to Jarod ! Jarod doesn 't want hate . Doesn 't want to kill . But someone wants to kill Jarod ! Did you really think I wouldn 't find out who you are ? Huh ? Jarod ! You 're a dead man , Jarod ! You hear me ? You 're dead ! Ooh , you need to chill out . Listen , Jarod , I 'll give you anything you want . See ya . - Jarod , no ! Let us out ! - He 's dead ! He 's dead ! You 're dead ! You 're dead ! Angelo , is it Joey ? No , not-not Joey ! Someone hates Jarod more . Hates others . We must find soon . This is going nowhere . - Jarod will die ! Patience , Parker . Angelo is narrowing down the suspects . Must find soon , or Jarod will die . We don 't have time to be patient . Finish them shells , Jarod . We need another loser at the table . You been cheatin ' . You gotta give me a chance to win . Everybody 's cheatin ' , Donny . - Who 's cheatin ' ? Delbert . - Yeah ! What you got ? What you got ? Let 's move along , man . - No , no , no , no . Two pair . Two pair . Two 10s , two sixes , and all mine , partner . Goin ' somewhere ? Yeah . To get a little black powder to pack around the C-4 . I thought it might give more impact visually . General wants to use napalm . Napalm ? But that wasn 't part ... - Nah , no buts . His plan , his cause ... We do things his way . You got a problem with that ? Hell , no . I 'm a believer . I just like to know what 's goin ' on . That 's all . And right now what 's goin on is you 're stayin ' here . Yes ... - General 's orders . Yes , sir . - Luke . What ? - You got another message from the general . There a problem ? - As a matter of fact , there is . He has word one of us isn 't exactly who we claim to be . Sounds like one of us is a traitor . General said to tell you no one leaves till he gets here . All right . You boys get back in the house . We 'll sort this out when the general shows up . Hey . God bless Kati and Daddy . And God bless Momma up in heaven . Amen . Amen . - Amen . All right , you two . Time for bed . Daddy 's angels got to rest those voices for the rally tomorrow . Why do those people hate us ? What did we do ? Here . Sit down . Come here , baby . Listen . You didn 't do anything wrong . You hear me , sweetheart ? You did nothing at all . People hate ... ' cause they 're afraid . They 're afraid of things that they don 't know . Things that they don 't understand . That 's why this rally is so important . Understand ? - Mm-hmm . You sure ? - Yes . Good . All right . Let 's get to bed . Get some sleep , and we 'll see you in the morning . All right . Mm . Night . Uh-oh . Got it ? Daddy got it . Mm . Love you . Daddy ? Can you please close the window ? Sure , sweetheart . And lock it . There . It 's locked . Good night . - Good night . Any word on Jarod ? Looks like Saturday night at your house , Broots . - Huh ? Angelo 's trying to empath Captain Robert Saunders . He 's the one serving 20 to life at Leavenworth , thanks to Jarod . Captain Robert Saunders . Textbook sociopath . As well as a convicted rapist and murderer . He certainly fits the profile . And he 's on record as having sworn to get back at Jarod . Jarod sure knows how to pick his enemies , doesn 't he ? Yes , he has a penchant for pissing people off . Saunders ! Hates Jarod ! Wants to hurt Jarod ! Wants to hurt Jarod ! What 's the matter , Saunders ? You look scared . Who 's in here ? - Just demons in your mind . Stevens , is that you ? Hey , this is crazy ! Well , gotta go now . Have fun in your own private little ... hell . Don 't leave ! Come on ! Let me out ! Saunders hates Jarod , but ... not him . Someone else hates Jarod more . It 's hard to imagine it could get much worse . Broots ! Hurry ! There 's no time left for Jarod ! Angelo , calm down ! I 've never seen him like this . Can 't calm down ! Hates Jarod ! Hates Jarod ! Hates Miss Parker too ! All right . He 's here . Jarod , get them damn beer bottles outta here . General , we 're glad you 're here . General . Sir . Everything 's ready for tomorrow , sir . We 're just waitin ' on your word . Just like you ordered , none of us have left . We 're all here to help you figure out who the traitor is , sir . Well , that won 't be necessary ... will it , Jarod ? What the hell is this ? You gonna stand there or cut me out of this ? I spent a long time making that thing . You cut me outta this now , or I 'll blow you away . Guess your clip 's empty . Gotta go . Hurricane 's comin ' right through here . You 're dead ! You 're dead , you son of a ... Matter of fact , we go back a long way , don 't we ? Last time we were together , there was a hurricane blowing ' . Let me tell you somethin ' . That storm ain 't got half the fury that I got left in me right now . Gentlemen , we 're back on schedule . Bartlett 's the guy that tried to kill Jarod ... and you . And almost succeeded . I had tracked Jarod to the middle of the Everglades ... where we were trapped together in a hurricane . So that 's the net Jarod used to capture him . Took more than a net to hold an animal like Bartlett . Honey , I 'm home . Bartlett , Angelo . Is he the one who 's going to kill Jarod ? Bartlett . Must stop Bartlett . Bartlett hates Jarod . Hates everyone . Bartlett wants to kill . Wants to kill Jarod . Sydney , help Jarod now . - Parker , we have to do something . Broots , call the Florida Bureau of Prisons . Find out if Bartlett is still in custody . - Okay . Bartlett is a racist sleazebag ... who would kill his own mother . Syd , we have to find him . If Bartlett finds Jarod first , he will kill him . And ruin my chance . Let 's just pray we 're not too late . Jarod , the Lord works in mysterious ways . See , you were his instrument to have me thrown into jail ... where I could come to see his purpose in my life . And then through his divine providence , I was set free ... so that I could unite my people and cleanse this country . And now here you are , dropped right in my lap . Manna from heaven . - You 're sick , Bartlett . You 're so consumed with hate , you 'll destroy yourself and everyone around you . No , Jarod . I 'm not sick . Misunderstood , yes . Persecuted like the prophets of old , yes . But not sick . What do we do with him ? I 'll take him out in the woods and send him to his judgment . You don 't need to dirty your hands with this . Let me do it . It 'd be my honor to take this Judas to his justice . A true apostle . Do it down by the creek and just leave his body there . Dust to dust . We have things to do for the unity rally tomorrow , don 't we ? There are gonna be a lot of people singing the blues tomorrow . Get him outta here . - Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's go ! Let 's go . Go on ! Get down ! Get down on your knees ! You can 't do this ! I hope I didn 't scare ya too bad . Well , I gotta check my pants . But I 'm still alive . I 'm undercover too . Georgia State Police . A. T. F. , federal task force . We 've been after Bartlett ever since his conviction for murder ... and civil rights violations were overturned . Some Fed popped him for those . My guess is that was you . Guilty . I had no idea he 'd been released . Do you have a plan ? No , Bartlett 's changing everything . I 'm completely cut off from the outside . Look , we go back in there right now , we can pop him for conspiracy . No . We catch him in the act of setting those explosives , we can put him away for life . If we don 't stop him , he 's gonna kill Pastor Jones 's little girls . Here . Here . You go back in there . You keep him company . I 'll think of something . And , uh , good luck . Good luck . He didn 't beg ... much . Well , that 's too bad . Takes some of the fun out of it . I should 've known . Jarod crossed the detonator wires . This thing would 've never gone off . Well , look at that . Ain 't that pretty ? A little C-4 and napalm ... That oughta make quite a little statement . Yes , sir , it will . I 'll just run that into town . You tell me where you want me to place it . No . This is my vision . My calling . Then we 'll do it together . - I said it was my calling . I do it alone . You boys just be ready tomorrow . Be ready for war . I 'd like you to meet someone , Jarod . You 're a girl . Why did you save my life ? - Because ... I still remember the little girl who gave me my first kiss . I found out something on Bartlett . He 's been released from prison . Let me guess . His conviction was overturned on a technicality . Exactly . But while he was in prison , he started a violent white supremacist group . And ? - And rumor is he 's in Georgia ... and he 's organized a march in opposition to a unity rally tomorrow . Then let 's stop the son ofa bitch . - Okay . And get Jarod . Here to repent , brother ! - Jarod ? Now who 's singing the blues ? - I 'm so sick to death of you ! You have more lives than a barnyard cat . But this is gonna be your last one . You weren 't able to take the rounds out of my clip this time . Well , I am sorry to disappoint you ... but guess who reloaded those shells ? I must have forgot to put shot in them . You son of a bitch ! Oh , by the way , I owe you this one . Oh , Bartlett ? Bartlett ? Wake up ! Jarod , what the hell is this ? Think of it as your cross to bear . And since you so enjoy burning crosses ... and terrorizing innocent families ... I thought it might be fun for you to experience terror for once . Like you were going to do to those two innocent little girls ! I wasn 't gonna scare 'em . I was gonna kill ' em ! Don 't make me laugh . Now , we 've been through this before , Jarod . You 're not gonna do anything . You ain 't got the heart for it . Now , that bitch you were with before ... She could do it . Yeah . Well , you see , it 's not heart that I need to burn you at the stake . It 's another part of my anatomy . And let me tell ya , I got those . You 'll never get away with this ! I got people out there . Luke and the boys . Luke ! Luke ! You know , something , Bartlett ? You 're not as smart as you think you are . You had two infiltrators in your group . Luke was an undercover cop with the Georgia State Police . The rest of your apostles should be in custody just about now . Damn you ! Damn you ! - No ! Damn you ! You can 't do this ! Please don 't do it ! Don 't do it ! Don 't ! Help ! I don 't wanna die ! No ! No ! No ! Don 't burn me alive ! Please ! Jarod , I 'm sorry ! Please ! I don 't wanna die ! Jarod , I 'm begging you ! Please , not like this ! God ! No ! No ! I don 't wanna die ! I don 't wanna die ! Someone help me ! Help ! Help , Jarod , please ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm so sorry ! Dear God ! Please ! No ! You know something ? You 're right . I don 't have the heart to kill . Or the hate . Mmm . Have fun ... rotting in prison . You start speaking in tongues ... and I 'll send you on to the next life right here and now . Sorry . It kinda reminds me of goin ' with my cousin Newt ... to the Slippery Rock Church of the Great Redeemer when I was a kid . Hi . Thanks for comin ' . Sorry . Standin ' room only . - We 're not here to worship , Reverend . Pastor . I 'm Pastor Jones . Pastor Jones , we are looking for this man . The name is Jarod . We believe he 's involved in a confrontation with a racist named Bartlett . I 'm sorry . Never seen him before . Now , I do know about Bartlett . If you wanna talk to him , try the State Penitentiary . Good . I hope they fry his ass this time . Well , ma 'am , it 's my hope and prayer ... that one day Bartlett will choose to end that life of hate . And start the healing ' ... that only love and forgiveness will bring . Better pray for all of us . - God bless you . Pastor Jones , thank you kindly . We 're outta here , Syd . Looks like their guardian angel 's come and gone .

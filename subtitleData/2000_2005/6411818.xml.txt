 D 'Argo : Why the hezmana don 't we just jettison this thing into frelling space ? Crichton . First he wants to question these creatures , then he wants to bury them . I mean , why don 't we just open the last chamber and ask them where Earth is ? And then he 'll die in the first thirty microts like this one did . Well , death isn 't always a bad thing , Aeryn . Who wants to live when your place in the universe has been suspended ? Jothee and Chiana are just kids , D 'Argo . I don 't want to discuss it . They were rebelling , they weren 't trying to ... Rebelling ? Rebelling is smoking some galla root . Rebelling is not sleeping with ... Aghh ! Aghh ! Aghh ! Trasta jutu das ! Look , D 'Argo , if you want to talk ... I 'm not ready . Now that ship , I 'd like to jettison . What if there 's some weapon aboard that we could use ? What if the next system we set off destroys us all ? We 're already destroyed , Aeryn . It 's just that some of us don 't know it yet . Pilot : I am as concerned about Zhaan 's welfare as you , Commander . However ... Crichton : Stark says we 've got to get her in the ground soon . How long ? A planet meeting Zhaan 's atmospheric requirements is less than an arn away . So hetch it up , baby . Come on , let 's go . I simply thought you 'd like to see this before it went away . What ? Holy ... Pilot , take readings . Complete spectrum roll , diffuse electron analysis across the electromagnetic range . It 's only theoretical but look for a dimensional bend in the halo effect . Commander ? - I know , I know . Zhaan . Look , scan on the parabolic curve . Give me a chance to dip in for some readings . Prepare to launch my module . Commander . Pilot ! My call . There 's a ship approaching , I ... I think . Where ? Not sure . These readings can 't be . Pilot , save the golly-gee-whiz for later . Just tell me where it is . It 's traveling too fast . Too ... impossible . All right , so far I 've got " not sure " , " can 't be " and " impossible " . Where the hell is it ? Up there ! Pilot , Starburst ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Pilot ? Pilot ! That ain 't part of Moya . What the hell ! Aeryn ! D 'Argo ! Zhaan ! Pilot ! Pilot : Commander ! What did we ... I don 't know , some kind of collision . You okay ? Moya and I are ... hard to think . Aghhh ... Kreetago : Neeyala ! We have extensive damage ... Alien penetration of our vessel ! Neeyala : An impact during phase resolution . What the hell did you do to Moya ? We must maintain integrity as prescribed . Aeryn : Crichton , my comms aren 't work ... What did you do ? ! Get down on the ground now ! Get down on the ground ! - Aeryn ! Hey , whoa , whoa ! Stop it ! Stop it ! I don 't think they understand what we 're saying . Zhaan : Dear goddess , help ! Moya 's in agony ! Someone answer ! Tier Three is dark ! Ruptures everywhere ! Zhaan , D 'Argo , you guys okay ? I am , but Moya is frelled . Anyone hear from Aeryn ? What about me ? No one asks about me . ( warbling roar ) - Oh . Crichton : Listen , Pilot 's not in too good a shape . Is anybody nearby ? I 'm on my way . I 'll meet you . So many different tongues , yet they communicate . Pip , you still there ? - Tier Six is a total loss . A Consortium . Sparky , go help her . Doesn 't simply shooting them dead strike you as viable ? Just go ! ( grunts ) DRD , Translator Microbes . They 've injected me with something ! Fight while you have strength ! No , no , no , no , no , no ! Stop , please ! Just wait ! Wait ... just ... My name is John Crichton , can you understand me ? He speaks and I comprehend ... They have altered your mind . I am Pathfinder Neeyala , commanding research vessel Rado Slana . I don 't know what 's wrong . I don 't know what 's happening to us . All right , just calm down Pilot , and tell us how you feel . Well , I feel ... aghh ! Ohh ! Ohh ! D 'Argo : I had no idea that he could do that . I had no idea anyone could do that ! I apologize . Colors , lights , sensations . This region of space ... I cannot function under the bombardments . Can we isolate you from the stimuli ? Neural clusters ... containment nexus circuitry ... Reroute it ? Dis ... Buffer the leads ? Dis ... Both : What ? ! Disconnect ! - Right ! Neeyala : We were regaining dimensionality when our ships collided and must 've been subjected to a massive burst of photonic distortion . Once the Phaztillon Generator is repaired , we 'll dose ourselves and hope your living ship doesn 't interfere with non-thermal dimensional forces . Do you understand any of those words ? Yeah , I watched all kinds of Star Trek . It 's just the order that they 're in . You said you studied wormholes ? More trickery , Neeyala . Of course they would say ... You can shut the frell up , I think . Because if you 're not going to take the Translator Microbes , you don 't participate . Tell him that . Neeyala : You have seen our research vessel . If we are to trust each other ... Yes , I 'll take him around our ship . Right . Come on . Crichton : So , keep it simple . How do we get the ships apart ? Neeyala : Display . Wormholes always gravitate toward each other in segmented loops . ( low rumbling ) First jolts mean we 've exited one fragment of wormhole and then quickly into another . Only this gap is large enough to permit escape . And how often do we pass it ? Every third of an arn . Right . So we 'll activate your phase ... Phaztillon . ... Generator and then we 'll separate . In theory . However , we 're not even sure how far into the turbulence zone this collision threw us . Say that again ? We 've ricocheted into the distorted region that divides a wormhole from normal space time . What ? We ... I mean , we 're not even on the fairway ? We 're in the rough ? ( gasps ) Oh , I didn 't mean to startle . I am to die soon . The goddess has chosen my harbinger . A magnificent planet lies just out there to rejuvenate and sustain you . A serpent lies between . You 're ill . Hallucinations . Oh , my Stark . My wonderful Stark . So afraid to let go . I have a darkness which frightens lovers away . Whenever I assist the dying , I cannot help but absorb a tiny spillet of their existence . Over the cycles , the endless parade of death , I have accumulated a vast reservoir of evil . I cannot bear to lose the one thing that mitigates this twisted core of my existence . None of what you said makes any sense . Stark : I think he said we 're in the wall of the wormhole . Well , that 's kinda what she said . Look , we 've got to wake Pilot up . He has to give a Starburst when we hit this particular gap . But can we do that while joined to another ship ? I 'm not sure , but they 're dead in the water , so Moya 's gotta pop us free . How do we get the ships separated ? Save that for later . Colonel Klink , yo , inspection is over . Aeryn , I need you to take Neeyala 's countdown . The rest of us are going to seal the breaches before Starburst . I have the Oxillary conduits . I 'll check the Hamman side hatches on the way to Command . Move it . Now . Go . I 'll go to Pilot . I 'm close to the Selticore vents . And I 'll take the cargo bays . Well , I 'm going to need someone up here with another pair of hands . What can I do to help ? Two tiers down , four chambers across . Moya 's external pressure senses . Yank ' em all . I mean , what can I do about us ? That relationship does not exist . We could die . It exists for me . If you did not want to marry me , you could have found some other way to tell me . When I 'm cornered , I ... I don 't think clearly . At least now you 're speaking the truth . External pressure senses ? Yank ' em all . I 'm kind of in the mood to be destructive . ( coughing ) What did you do ? ! I was checking the hangar . This started leaking . It regulates with self-venting ! I tried to close the valve , but it wouldn 't turn . Because it was already sealed ! Mmm . Then I twisted the other way . Rygel , you opened it , opened it , opened it ! ( both gasping ) ( grunting ) I 'll bet 40 mesots she gurgles and dies before she can tell you where Earth is . Hey , Sleeping Beauty . Wake up and die . Who are you ? My name is John . Listen , we don 't have much time . Correct . Yours is up . Get ... ! Don 't touch me . Do you know me ? My race ? Sebacean . Intellectually suited to carry weapons and die marching in formation . Human . Your species and mine might be related . ( sarcastic chuckle ) Of course they are . I have a brother who 's a Stenerian lizard . Have you ever heard of Earth ? On Trintika Major , the predorian fly transmits a fatal rheumatoid disease called Arth . Uh . Very similar . ( grunts ) The animal speaks ? ( angry growl ) Whoa . What 's your name ? Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hovalis . What do they call you for short ? My whole name . Listen , Jool , what 's the last thing you remember ? How long have I been in this chamber ? Manifest says 22 cycles . ( piercing scream ) Crichton : Whoa . Whoa . Hey , lady , dial it down ! We 're ready , Crichton . Prepare to Starburst in five microts . Aeryn , I can 't hear a thing you 're saying . Aeryn : Three microts . One ... It is time . Starburst . You die later . Starburst now ! Crichton : Kill Starburst ! Kill Starburst ! Bad ? Is two of you bad ? That so depends . Well , it 's not bad enough . You should let Zhaan have a look at it . Zhaan does not have much respect for my head . You know , it 's okay to be in pain , D 'Argo . But since you 're all right , I 'll get back to work . ( grunts ) It 's all r ... Crichton : We 're going to have to separate before we do anything . Suggestions . Zhaan , you ought to hear this . Um , am I wrong or is your Phaztillon Generator the key ? Correct pronunciation , and yes . Can you repair the damage before we 're all incapacitated ? The belief is so . However , circumstances , you will attest , are less than conducive . Zhaan : Pathfinder Neeyala , if your crew will not accept Translator Microbes then I cannot communicate . If I cannot communicate , I cannot heal . Uh , we have rules against alien exposure . It is sufficient I have broken them . I understand , but under these extreme ... Shreena : Pathfinder ! Pathfinder ! Help him , please . His leg . We need help . Zhaan : Tell her to follow me . My lab is the only place I might heal him . Besides my people healthy , I need empirical information about our position in the wormhole . Despite the danger , would you help ? Can you hear me ? Crichton , stopping Starburst midway through took everything out of him . We need him to get the hangar doors open . Right now he can 't even open his eyes . There 's not much else I can do , Crichton . Does this negate our plan ? No , it doesn 't . I can open the doors from Pilot 's console . Yes . May we have a moment ? Oh . Mmm . Insane . Since birth . Suicidal . Test pilot . Do you trust her ? If we don 't do something , we 're gonna die . I 'm worried you 're a little too excited by all this . It 's wormholes . That 's what Scorpius wants . Scorpius is dead . That 's what you want . Aeryn , it could be a tool or a weapon . Let 's get there first . Let 's get there alive , first . She doesn 't like you . Nah , it 's a phase . It 's part of her charm . I admit to some skepticism myself . This way . My module jams in wormholes . If this is some kind of jest ... Just give me the gizmo and tell me what to do . Without this data our assumptions would be worse , and ... than guesswork . - Flight times and vectors . That 's all I need . Zhaan : Crichton , is Neeyala with you ? Yes , Blue . Please tell her I couldn 't save Cresto . I 'm sorry . I do appreciate the risk you take for us , and our families . We shall return that effort in selfless kind . Use this to record as much positional data inside the wormhole as you can . Vharishta ... gailin ... gailin ... Vharishta . ( wind whooshing ) It 's no use . Even with the isolation D 'Argo 's providing , we 're traveling too fast for Pilot to cope . It 's all right . I know the hangar door configuration . ( beeping ) Something wrong ? You 're very pretty . But I 'm not Zhaan , right ? Never be her . It 's all right , Stark . We 're going to get her out of here and we 're going to put her in the soil she needs to heal . ( beeping ) Despite your fears , this must be accomplished . The generator 's leaking phasic reston ions . Lethal , Kreetago . I know what they are , Researcher . Expose yourself briefly as possible . Accomplish the task Pathfinder has laid out for you . May I interdict , Kreetago ? No . The knowledge this ship has amassed must be saved . Even if we die in the process . I can 't believe my cousins are dead . Rygel : They didn 't suffer . Much . Animal , how did they die ? Oh , if you must know , we were at a surgical facility where you were all frozen . Crichton needed a brain storm on how he could rescue you . We saved two pods . One of my cousins survived ? Yeah . For 30 microts . Then he oozed this ... this black gunk . We don 't know how the other one died do we , Ryg ? ( chuckles ) What is it you 're not telling me ? Well that we 're in a crisis , hairdo , so you can either help , shut up , or go back to sleep . I won 't be spoken to like that by some ... alley whore . ( Rygel laughs ) How could she know that about you ? ( grunts ) Did you know she had a fiancé till she slept with his son ? Buckwheat . You still want to get off this boat , man ? More than ever . This creature sheds ... Good , ' cause your Uncle Sam needs you . ( beeps and trills ) We enter conventional space within 30 microts . Once clear , spiral hard , 71 degrees , vector briko . Crichton : Roger , copy that . Thanks for the intel . This is Farscape One . Y 'all leave the light on for us . Rygel : What 's happening ? It 's your basic ass-kicking wormhole , Ryg . How you doing back there ? Lousy ! Excellent . Turn on that alien gizmo . Maximum power . Are we dead ? Oh , no . Rygel , you know what this is ? No . The Holy Grail . The zone . We are in the effin ' zone , man . This is the dirty little secret of the universe . It all works if you know how to use it . Can these things take us home ? In a heartbeat , if you know where you 're going . ( grunts ) Aeryn : D 'Argo . D 'Argo ! Pilot has been unconscious for over an arn now . Well , why didn 't you stop me earlier ? Well , somehow I have a feeling this isn 't about him anymore . I 'm sorry . I 'm angry with myself because I could almost forgive her . Why don 't you ? How can I trust Chiana with my heart ? Can you trust Crichton again ? He trusts these aliens . We know nothing about them . I think wormholes blind him . Well , at least he has a hobby . Help me keep an eye on it ? What the frell was that ? Zhaan told Stark she saw a serpent . She said that it was an omen for her . Did it look like that was aiming for Zhaan ? Wormhole . Normal space . Wormhole . Oh , what are we doing here ? Making 17 loops to their one . Each time we lap ' em , it calibrates their position in the slower wall of the wormhole . Engrossing . Who cares ? It 's only collecting images , none of which mean anything . Well , you got to know how deep the doo-doo is , Ryg , if you 're gonna dig your way out . Next gap is the big one , right ? Yep . Why don 't we just escape ? Does it ever bother you being selfish ? ( laughs ) It 's self-preservation , and no . What about our friends ? What friends ? We were thrown together against our will , and we 're all just trying to make the best of it until we can get the chance to screw the others and get what we want . I vote out at the next gap . ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) Pa 'u Zotoh ... Hello , Pilot . Soon you must deploy the docking web to rescue Crichton and Rygel . You are masterful with him . Zhaan : I am but a servant . This you will learn . I could never replace you . Stark , you must . For me , you must remain here , and minister these souls . I 'm relying on it . But I love you . If I did not feel the same , and more , could I ask this sacrifice of you ? Aeryn : Zhaan , I need you to meet me in Command . It must wait , Aeryn . We 're about to deploy the docking web . No , your omen , the serpent . Is anyone else meant to see it ? And the big gap . X clearly marked normal space . ( explosion ) Hey , whoa , whoa ! Get your hands off those controls . You have no right to make decisions for me . ( snarls ) Aghh ! Rygel : We 're free ! Escape ! Save our lives ! Crichton : Guido , we are going back ! Oh ! ( groaning ) Son of a bitch . You broke my nose . You ain 't got a nose , Guido . You got slits . Oh ! Farscape One to Moya . Positive contact with the docking web . Hey , nice catch , guys . ( groaning ) I won 't forget this , Crichton . I swear you 've attacked me for the last time . You brought it on yourself , Rugrat . You delay my preparations for Crichton 's data . The serpent is harmless . Less than convincing . Try again . I never imagined that you would encounter this beast , otherwise , I would have issued warning . You must believe me . How can we , Neeyala ? Look at what you 've done to our ship . Oh , what I have done ? It is you who have destroyed my life 's endeavor whilst I have suffered your probing , your confusions and your smell . Do you not think that my bristles contain enough poison to dispatch you all ? Yet when I fail to overload what are clearly inferior intellects with a drist of needless information , you bring weapons to bear . Kill me , if you will . See how you fare on your own . Do you feel better ? Now , about the serpent . The creature you have seen exists exclusively inside wormholes . Corporeal only when the generator shifts our phase presence . Which one would have to do to repair it . I doubt it even senses us . Be less alarmed . ( Jool screaming ) - Shut up ! Would you shut up ! Zhaan : What happened ? There 's something really weird and ... and I tried to shoot when ... Shut up ! - Shut up ! Zhaan : Neeyala said that the serpent doesn 't even know we 're here . ( screaming ) ( high-pitched squeal ) I thought you were with Pilot . I thought you were in the Neural Cluster . Filtration 's down on Tier One . You can 't even breathe in there . Junctions are frying everywhere . Pilot can 't stop it . Well , you had better tell that four-armed , bug-eyed , whiny little slijot to get his dren together . It 's not him . The stresses on Moya are frying junctions everywhere . She 's dying , D 'Argo . The wormhole is killing her . Do you hope someday to be Dominar , Rygel ? I am is still Dominar . Always Dominar . I mean , ruling from a throne instead of a throne sled . They 'll never know if I kill Crichton . But you will ... ( groans ) Fool the others if you like , but I see the larger goodness in a small Hynerian . Separating this alien ship from Moya must be your first priority , Rygel . Have I ever told you that I appreciate your counsel ? Continuously , by accepting it . ( sighs ) It 's amazing the number of species picked up by Neeyala 's gizmo . Thousands of cultures spread out across the galaxy . I resent you calling me here at a whim . That 's the way it works , Harvey . You don 't like it I could toss you back in the dumpster . ( animal growling ) You think Scorpy 's still alive ? Do you think Scorpius is still alive ? Without doubt . What 's he doing with the information he stole from my brain ? The knowledge placed there by the ancients is by now centerpiece of a sprawling new research facility . If he masters wormhole technology , what will he use it for ? Faster delivery of pizzas . Neeyala thinks it 's possible we can separate the ships . But only one will survive . We have to pick which one . Yes , it 's a shame about Moya . She 'll be fondly remembered . It 's not a done deal . Did you call me here to talk you out of your guilt ? No . It 's just the information amassed inside their ship . No contest . I sit here inside your feeble brain listen to the arguments bounce off the hollow spaces . How could you not chose science over a beast of burden ? You disgust me , John . I long for the dumpster . ( sighs ) Scorpius : Pilot and Moya are to die , John . Take the wormhole knowledge that 's fallen in your lap and call it a day ! I cannot believe what I am hearing . - Facts , D 'Argo , that 's all . Zhaan : How is this even a choice ? Because some of us want to live ! If we use Starburst to ... What , you didn 't get slammed against the wall hard enough last time ? So , we recover the data from the precious ship and leave in Moya . Neeyala : Our craft itself is the knowledge base repository . The ship is one giant computer chip . It 's all or nothing . Zhaan : Then nothing . We will never abandon Moya while I am still alive . Rygel : Frelling martyr . ( rumbling ) Why not separate in one of these gaps ? We need the density of the wormhole wall to help pull us apart . Do you have only one good ear , also ? I 'm not dying just because the ship can eat and crap . ( rumbling ) Okay . So we separate . What then ? One vessel slides into the wormhole core , maintaining a chance of enduring . The other tumbles uncontrolled through the wormhole wall into normal space , to be atomized by differentials in speed and density . Zhaan : It is still not a choice . Moya and Pilot are living beings . They must be afforded every opportunity . Crichton : Zhaan , the bio-mechanoid parts on my ship were fried . Neeyala : Calculations indicate that your Leviathan 's design will work against her survival . Forgive me , Pathfinder Neeyala , but I do not count you as unbiased . Ha ! Like you are . You know what you and Pilot have in common besides big eyes ? You 're both dying . And now you want to take us with you . Ow ! Can it , F. Lee . Zhaan , Pilot is unconscious . Moya 's nexus system is so backed up , the Roto-Rooter man couldn 't get it ... I know the litany , John . How desperate you must be for this wormhole knowledge . Unfair . You place your obsession above the lives of your friends . What ? ! What have these strangers done to so earn your trust ? Zhaan : We must check for backup systems . I need to know that Pilot and Moya are truly beyond hope . Let 's go . You want to know what really happened to your cousin ? What Crichton won 't tell you ? ( Chiana sobbing ) How you feeling ? You missed the debate . But that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . I feel guilty . What possibly for ? I ... I love Pilot , and I ... and I love Moya , but I don 't wanna die here . There 's nothing wrong with a decision of the heart , child . In the time that is left , use your mind to satisfy your soul that it is correct . Hey , how 'd you go ? Well , if it wasn 't Moya we wouldn 't be having this conversation . Yeah , it 's the same everywhere . Total meltdown . I 'm going to make a run through the ion-backwash chambers , see if there 's anything I can do . Hey . You all right ? No . ( banging ) ( electronic wheezing ) What the hell are you doing ? And what happened to your hair ? It 's red . You 're not planning to ... ( gasps ) Yes . What the hell are you trying to do ? You lied to me . You butchered my cousin 's brain so you could steal a wellot of his neural fluid ? A member of the intellectual elite . Sixteen advanced degrees . Traded for the likes of you ? Cut it out , lady . If we 're to perish , then at least you 'll die first . I thought you were good with women . I am . Did you see what happened when she fired at the ship ? Actually , no . I was looking at the pulse rifle . There 's a small gap in the forcefield . Which , unsurprisingly , is the key to its access . Now , John , we 're trapped in this vawn of a wormhole , Pilot 's unconscious , Moya is dying , and my son has slept with my betrothed . Lock this woman up ! Entreaties , Pathfinder . Mmmm ... I do not enjoy sending you to your death , youngling , but options are depleted . I want to live . More important , do you want your family to live ? You know what happens to ours should this ship fail to return . Will you tell them ... That you thought of them to the end . Attention now , Shreena . Time is limited . These creatures , I will distract them . They must not know your true mission . Frell ! Chiana : I checked this panel , and it was fine . But before I had a chance to close it , it shorted out . There are dozens more just like this on this tier . Rygel : Then why are we standing here ? That hatch could blow . Chiana : He 's right . Functioning DRDs are overmatched . There 's no way we can repair all the damage . Let us not forsake our friends until we are undeniably clear that ... Well that settles it then . We will go with Neeyala and we will abandon Moya . I have failed my purpose , Stark . You protect , heal , give hope . This ship and her pilot are to die . As do all things . Once out of the wormhole , you will heal in the soil of the fertile planet , and one day , your gifts will again help others . I cannot take you back , Chiana . But I won 't leave you alone in pain . Have you ever been responsible for another 's death , Officer Sun ? Yes , I have . This is my first time . Did you know your crew well ? Enough to steel my determination . On their memory , I will not fail . Crichton : Pilot , you should see all these cultures that you can touch with one wormhole . Man , I wish you were going with us . Hey , Pilot . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Could 'a ... Would 'a ... Should 'a . Aeryn ! Hey !

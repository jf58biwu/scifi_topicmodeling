 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . Hey . - What 's the matter ? Dreams ? - Yeah . I know the feeling . Come here . We 've been walking in tall cotton for six years now . - Are we grateful ? Yeah . - Yeah ! - Do we want another six ? - Yeah ! Please give a big Texas welcome ... to a real son of the Lone Star State , Senator Brian Perry . Nice to see you . Thanks . Hey , how are you ? Hey , you ! How are you ? What 's the scene ? Thank you very much for coming out . I appreciate your support . Absolutely . Gun ! We got to get down ! - Watch the gun . - Oh , my God ! Put him down ! Put him down ! - Somebody call an ambulance . - Is he all right ? - Bev . Bev , call my daughter . - Don 't worry . I 'll take care of it . - Call her . - Watch your hands . - All right . - All right . Good . - That 's it . Let 's go . - Yeah . Let 's go . What the fuck ? Frank , got a DOA back here . - Excuse me , miss ? - Yeah ? Excuse me . I was wondering , have you seen my son ? He 's about six years old , about this high . He 's got little dreadlocks . - No . - He 's usually with his grandmother . - Sorry . - Sarah ! - What ? - He took him . - He took him away . - What ? Paul found out I was meeting you , and he took Corey away . Where ? He wouldn 't tell me . He said he couldn 't trust me . I 'll be running a lot of equipment here ... so I 'll need to tie in to the main junction box . Will that be a problem ? No , no . That 's photographic equipment , right ? Yes . Yes , obviously . Is there a plumbing hook-up and a floor drain ? No , Mr Mendel . This is a storage facility . Yes , of course . Yes . I 'll need to bring in a hazardous waste disposal unit ... for my photographic chemicals . Will that be a problem ? No . No , not at all . - Good . Good . - Good . - We have a deal . - Great . - Thank you . - Thank you . Bye . - How do you do it ? - Do what ? Go on with the everyday , ordinary stuff , day after day ... when you believe it 's all gonna end ? Can 't think about it like that , Paige . I don 't even have the heart to work in my garden today . 'Cause if everything you say is true , then roses just don 't matter . Roses are a good thing , Paige . I was in the supermarket this morning . I saw this pregnant woman . I just kept thinking she ... She 's probably not gonna get to see her kid grow up . So ? So how can you wax your car ? Paige , when I was about 20 years old in college ... I read this Japanese story about some 16th century warrior ... all bound up in the back of an ox cart . They were taking him out of the mountains down to town square ... to have his head cut off . Just offed somebody . About halfway down the mountains ... these soldiers stop at a little inn and get some water . One of these soldiers sees a fig tree , picks a fig , turned around . He feels sorry for this warrior all gacked up ... in the back of this cart , going to die in two hours . Offers the warrior a fig . Warrior says , " No , thank you . They 're bad for my health . " I almost get you . Guy 's gonna die in two hours , and he 's still taking care of his health . The point is , Paige , ain 't nothing like knowing exactly ... when you 're going to die that drives you right into the here and now . I love this car now . I love my family now . Get me ? You understand . Listen to me . Five of us were sent back here . Now , that means to me that somebody is looking out for us . You mean God ? God , Yahweh , Allah , Jesus , Mary , and Joseph ... all the saints , the good Hindi gods , Buddha , Great Spirit , aliens . Who the hell knows ? I don 't give a shit what you call it . But he sure has a trick up his sleeve , and he 's on our side . That 'd be good . I tell you what . Why don 't I help you with the roses ... then you and me jump in this jalopy and we go up to the lake , do some mischief ? Oh , I see . By the way , now that I know you 're not having an affair anymore ... who has been calling and hanging up ? Right . That 's that old girlfriend . Jerk . Paul called me last night so I wouldn 't worry ... but he still won 't tell me where they are . Let us know if there 's anything we can do . - Like break his legs . - Yeah . You know , none of this shit happened in the old 2002 . Well , if we keep blundering around , changing history , no wonder ... You 're saying I 'm responsible for my father being shot ? And you 're saying it 's my fault that my husband disappeared with my son ? Oh , calm down , girls . What I 'm saying is , in a roundabout way , we 're all at fault here . All right , is this starting to wear on anyone else ? We 're supposed to be saving the planet , not fucking up our lives . - You want to make an omelette ? - So , then what ? It 's open season on friends and family ? I 'm with Neil . We 're the proverbial bull in the china shop ... doing untold and irreparable damage to ourselves and to others . The solution 's in the solution , ladies and gentlemen ... - so anybody got a positive suggestion ? - As a matter of fact , I do , Chuckie . We need to study the enemy , know what we 're up against inside and out . No shit , Sherlock . The last time I looked in the public library ... there weren 't no " How to " manual on these freaks . But there is a " How to " manual , in the form ... of the beautifully preserved Synthetic body buried in the bloody woods , Chuck . Give it up , Kurt . We are not digging up Harry . Wonderful . Fabulous . Now what do we do ? How about Bright Sky ? Your father 's on the Senate Appropriations Committee . Maybe there 's a connection . Ed Scrivens got himself killed just for looking into it . You want to talk to him ? Bloody hell , Chuck ! I 'm trying to find a solution . You asked for one . Okay . You 're right . All right , we need to find out why Senator Perry was shot at . In order to do that , we need to go to the source . Now , does anyone know anything about the shooter ? Well , I guess we should look into it , then . That 's a positive suggestion . Eat up and let 's get on a good foot . White male , approximately 40 years of age , 72 kilos postmortem weight . Apparently likes cheeseburgers , fries , and root beer . So much for junk food . Is there anything else you can tell us , Lynn ? If you mean do I know the cause of death ? No , I don 't . Well , it seems pretty obvious he took a bullet to the brain , didn 't he , Doctor ? There is a gunshot wound to the anterior cortex , yes . - And it certainly should 've been fatal , but ... - Should 've been ? Please expand . The suspense is killing me . If you don 't mind , I prefer not to discuss my work while I 'm eating . Lynn , could you just elaborate a little bit ? I promise we 'll get out of your hair . It should 've been fatal , unless ... Unless he was already dead . - But , of course , we can 't say that . - So what can we say , Doctor ? All the nerve fibre and soft tissue of the cerebellum and thalamus ... through which the bullet passed showed signs of prior morbidity . The man 's brain was not living tissue at the time he was shot . Okay . If it was dead tissue , then that means he was already dead ... when he tried to assassinate Senator Perry ? That 's what all my tests indicate . So something must 've gone wrong with my tests ... and I have to start again , at the beginning . But to do that at this hour , I need calories to turn into energy . - So if I may ? - Thank you , Lynn . Bon app√©tit , Lynn . - Now what ? - We need to see this body . I 'll be right back , Senator . Sorry . Can you see in the dark ? No . Will you stop shining that bloody light in my face ? This requires skill and finesse , something you 're foreign to . You got about two seconds to finesse ... before I crowbar that lock and your hands along with it . Yeah , well , watch the master at work . One , two ... - Coming ? - Let 's go , Mr Finesse . Three . - I feel like Sweeney Todd . - You mean the hairdresser ? - This one 's female . - Knife fight . Here we go . White male in their 40s , bullet to the brain . That 's our boy . It 's not like any corpse I 've ever seen before . It seems to me there 's some kind of residue inside the cut . - Almost like he left a layer of skin behind . - What 's with all them veins ? Hold onto this . Here we go . Good . Good boy . You getting an appetite ? Oh , yes . This and a nice glass of Chianti . It 's all yours , darling . Buenas noches . Do you know any Spanish ? The Gazette has me ahead of Reyes by 15 % . 15 % for a flesh wound ! Lmagine if he 'd done some serious damage . - Hey . - Hey , darling . Come on in . Glad to see you . Hey , check out what they 're saying about your old man , there . The Latino community extends its sympathy to Senator Perry ... and sincerely wish him a speedy recovery . I 'm becoming a hero of the community . They 're going to be calling me El Jefe soon . Dad . Look , would you all mind giving us a minute alone here ? Thanks very much . Appreciate it . Yeah . Here . - They won 't let me light this . - Good . - Got a kiss for me ? - I guess . I hate to admit anything at my age ... but I guess that 's what they would ... The true believers would call a wake-up call . Yeah . I know what you mean . Wasn 't sure you were going to make it , there . Well , I 'm a hell of a lot tougher than I look . - Why do you think this guy came after you ? - No idea . None at all . No threats ? You didn 't get any hate mail ? No , just the usual love letters , you know , reminding me ... that I 'm a racist , corporate-loving , fat old white man . I think I wrote that one . Careful . Daddy , have you ever heard of a DOD project called Bright Sky ? Bright Sky , huh ? No . Are you sure ? I 'm slack , but I 'm not that slack . I spend my days looking for non-Texan pork to cut . Never came across it . You think I need looking out for ? Is that what my little girl is doing ? - People are shooting at you . - Oh , that ? Yeah . - Honey , where 's my crossword puzzle ? - Yeah . Bye . - That was your sister . - That 's great . How 's she doing ? - Can I have my puzzle , please ? - Oh , she 's got a new job ... and she 's got a new boyfriend , but I don 't imagine you care too much about that . You don 't know that . Thank you . Chuck , you know , if I lived through the end of the world ... and then had the chance to do it all over again ... I 'd start by making amends with my family . Paige , I done cleaned up my side of the street with my sister ... but it 's going to take more than the end of the world for her to lighten up with me . There 's something else I wanted to ask you about . About the kids . You 've already lived through the next five years of their lives . Yeah . So you know things that I don 't . About the missions that Marc flew . Neil , does he even graduate ? Please tell me that he does not get arrested and go to jail for drugs . Paige , Neil does not get arrested , go to jail for drugs ... nor does he become a member of a rock ' n roll band or any other hippie shit . I can tell you what 's happened , but I cannot tell you what 's gonna happen . See , we come back here and we 're futzing with time ... and now everything is changing so fast , we don 't know . I just want to know what you know . Okay . First time around , Neil straightens up . He finishes an advanced degree in record time ... and he becomes the youngest man ever in space . - Oh , come on . - I 'm serious . Really ? How do you think he gets up in space with me and we end up back here ? - How does Neil do that ? - I don 't know . He 's got some nose for it . I mean , he 's a digital genius or something . We were distracted by the grunge clothes and the Ozzy Osbourne hair . Oh , my God . - So , that 's why he cut his hair ? - Yeah . He 's really 22 . In a 17-year-old 's body . Go figure . And Marc becomes an astronaut ? No , Marc does not become an astronaut , baby . Marc busts out and then he takes off . I think it 's because he 's afraid of facing us and how disappointed we 'd be . - Takes off where ? - He didn 't tell us and we don 't know . And that 's why this time around I 've been doing everything in my power ... to dissuade him from going anywhere near NASA . That 's horrible , Chuck . We have to do something . We can 't let that happen . Let what happen , Paige ? Him washing out of NASA or taking off ? Leaving , Chuck . Leaving . Okay . Listen to me , honey . You 're part of this now , so you and I will do everything in our power ... to stop him from leaving , together . But we don 't know . We just don 't know . Looks like our shooter was a square . City bureaucrat for 14 years ... never even had a parking ticket . Happily married , two kids . Never raised a hand at anyone . Yeah . That 's what 's so weird . The guy 's not even registered to vote . I got to go . I 'll call you back . - You 're working late ? - I have a very demanding boss . You know , you 're amazing . I don 't know how you hold it all together . Anchor , researcher , mom . What is it , Sarah ? - Corey 's gone . Paul took him . - Took him ? I 'm not supposed to be seeing Corey without a social worker present . I was doing that , Paul found out about it and ... - I 'm sorry . - What am I supposed to do , you know ? A judge gives me an hour a week to see my kid . I 'm supposed to be a mother for an hour a week ? You didn 't agree to the move ? I 'm the one they 're running away from . Anyway , my lawyer says it 's going to take several months to sort it out and I just ... Then I don 't think much of your lawyer . Sarah , this could all turn out for the best . If he left without your permission , it could be considered an abduction . It might even be grounds to appeal your custody ruling . I know this really aggressive prosecutor in the Child Abduction unit . - How did my life get this screwed up ? - Don 't blame yourself . Sometimes things happen that you just can 't control . Kathy , it 's Troy . Good . Listen , I have a favour to ask . Did I say something wrong ? But if I did , I 'm sorry . What are you looking at ? It 's after midnight , honey . Come to bed . Why is this so interesting ? Do you want me to take care of myself ? You can watch . What 's wrong with you ? Oh , my God . It 's definitely synthetic . There 's nothing organic about this baby . I 'd say some kind of a polymer , strong , extremely elastic . - How can you tell it 's elastic ? - Stretched it . - Right . - I tried to cut it with a scalpel ... but it went straight through to the glass underneath . So I 'm assuming that this is some more of your patented fucked-up shit . I wouldn 't even begin to guess who could patent such a thing . Well , whoever it is doesn 't have to worry ... about where their next meal is coming from , that 's for sure . Oh , this is nothing . Wait till Prevlin hits the shelves . - How do you know about Prevlin ? - I know your little secrets , you devil , you . I hope you 've bought stock in that evil multinational ... that 's funding your research . Oh , no . That 's right . Don 't dance with the Man . No , I just don 't have any money . Sell the hatchback . Trust me . If you buy it now , it won 't be insider trading . - Fabulous . Let 's get back to ... - Right . Okay . It 's strong , it 's elastic , and it 's very dense . I 'm talking zero porosity here . If this were to cover your whole body tight enough , you 'd suffocate . I guess we won 't be seeing this in jockey shorts anytime soon . No . And there 's one more thing . Yeah . Shit 's definitely hard-wired to do something . " But what ? " is the question . So if this gets on you , it can somehow control you ? Hell if I know . Don 't look at me and don 't put that shit in my chilli . But the bigger question is , " Why Senator Perry ? " He says he doesn 't know why , and he 's never even heard of Bright Sky . Maybe Perry 's death helps avert the end of the world . The world did not explode because my father is an asshole . You do not know that . Well , none of us fucking know how it 's gonna end , do we ? Well , regardless , darling , if a Sentient wants your daddy dead , dead he will be . Well , not if I have anything to say about it . And if I have to do this alone ... Hey , nobody does nothing alone here , period . And that 's the punctuation on that . - Chandra . - It 's called Skin . Started as a computer game . The nerds at MIT played against the Pakistanis , the Chinese , the Russians . No language barriers on the Infobahn . You built your own code ... and were allowed to programme in the history of various types of combat . Martial arts , germ warfare , suicide bombers . And then , you went to war . The codes fought battles and absorbed each other ... growing more knowledgeable and more vicious . The final victor , Kwon ... named after his original combat programme , Tae Kwon Do ... disappeared into the Internet . Next time we heard of Kwon ... its programmer showed up in a redneck bar ... and picked a fight with a room full of bikers . He levelled 16 of them , but poor guy was 5 ' 4 " . Never took a karate class in his life . Then the bartender pulled out a shotgun . There 's only one word for Kwon : Malevolent . It created Skin to turn the maker into the puppet . All right . So how does Skin work ? It takes over a human host , covering it from head to toe . Everything but the eyes . It would be unstoppable , save for one thing : Skin suffocates the human body in just under an hour ... causing a massive heat stroke . It can use a dead host for a short while ... but then all the toxic gases force it off ... and it can 't live without a host . How delightful . But how does a computer programme create this thing ? Hijacked an experiment , something military . I mean , who knows ? Hey , Doctor , how do you know so much about this Kwon ? Kwon won the game . My guy came second . Yeah , but the most important question here is , " Why ? " You 're talking about jumping the reality , germ warfare , suicide bombers ... - in a fucking computer . Why ? - Domination . - They want to control the world . - To control what ? Diamond mines ? Uranium deposits ? Exports ? The NASDAQ ? What the hell 's the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , here ? There isn 't one . It 's their nature . When did you come back ? Believe it or not , when you found me ... I was ready to blow my brains out . You guys gave me hope ... that there were others out there . Guess you could say I 'm grateful . I wish I could help you more , but I 've got my own fight . Good luck . There 's a plate of food in the oven , honey . Okay . Thanks , Mom . - What 's that ? - My journal . A new project . Cool . Why the sudden burst of creativity ? - I 've got a lot of things to sort through . - Yeah ? Like your father claiming that you 're a 22-year-old astronaut . Oh ? Where do you stand on all this ? Time travel and aliens and the end of the world . Okay . It 's not a question of believing it . I lived through it . Dad and I both lived through it . I don 't know how you wrap your mind around something like that . You sound like your father . Yeah . Look , Mom , maybe it 's best if you just don 't think about it . Can 't stop myself . And besides , I want to help . Like your father said , I 'm part of this now . Look , honey , I 'm sorry I 've been so hard on you . No , Mom , Mom , Mom , please don 't . I should 've been less of a pain in the ass , okay ? Who would 've ever thought it would be you in space ? It 's all so mind-blowing . - Sarah ? - Yeah . We were able to track down the shooter 's wife , his two kids ... six of his co-workers , and nobody has reported anything abnormal . - Okay , well , just keep digging . Please ? - Yeah . Okay . Actually , there is one strange thing . The paramedic who took the shooter to the hospital , he disappeared . I need his address , phone number ... - wives , girlfriends , whatever you can find . - Okay . Yeah . No problem . Done . - Thanks . Hey . - Hey , Sarah . Listen , did my friend get back to you ? - Yeah . She did . - Yeah ? - It 's amazing . They found Paul . - Right . They said if he doesn 't come back , they 're going to press charges . - That 's great . - Thank you so much . I think one of the most beautiful things about you is the way you love your son . You 've been such a good friend through all of this , you know ? Listen . I got to say something . - I have been thinking ... - About ? I 've never been unfaithful in my life . But there is something here . I feel a connection with you that I 've never felt with Cheryl . I can 't . I can 't break you and your fianc√©e up . I just can 't do it , Troy . You know what , Sarah ? It 's too late . - It 's too soon , it 's too soon . - Too soon ? Oh , fuck it . - Mom , pick one . - For ? Casual dinner and a movie . Second date . - Things are okay with you ? - Yeah . - You and Dad still working things out ? - Yes , working things out . - And you and Neil are okay ? - Yeah , Mom , we 're fine . We are . It 's a bad time , but we 're a family . We need to start acting like one again . - Yeah . I know . - You know what we need ? To sit down together to a good old-fashioned Sunday dinner . - You 're such a mom . - Thank you . - Now , how do I look ? - Fantastic . Yeah . I think I look good in this shirt . Okay , there obviously ain 't nobody home . So why am I starting to feel like ... The Hamburglar ? Exactly . We got one option . What are you doing ? Do you know how many crime scenes I 've broken into ? Be my guest . You 're ripping off my moves . What is that smell ? It 's called decomposition . - My God . - Oh , no . Is this our paramedic ? - Yeah , looks like him . Here . - Yeah . I 'm wondering if this is our host . It 's a definite possibility . I 'm only speculating , but a body struggling for respiration ... would probably shoot out a network of veins and capillaries just like that . The real question is , where did Skin go ? Hey , guys ! What ? Is she dead ? Her body doesn 't have the same discolouration . She probably didn 't die the same way as her boyfriend . Hey ! Get her off me ! Looks just like our paramedic . Dad ? Jesus . Didn 't hear you come in . Chuck , I talked to Marc ... and this whole thing is just breaking my heart . I can 't ... Chuck ! Chuck ! What is it ? No , don 't touch me . Don 't touch me . - Chuck ! - Run ! Get out now ! - I 'm not leaving you . - Paige , just go ! Paige , don 't touch me . Run ! Dad ? Paige ! - Dad ! - Neil , Neil , give me your cell phone . That stuff got on your mom . - What ? - That Skin stuff , it got on your mother . - Hey , hey , what 's going on ? - It couldn 't live on me , so it got to her . - What got her ? - Come on , come on . - Damn it , you never should 've told her . - Told her what ? - She never should 've been a part of this ! - I know that , damn it ! What the fuck is going on ? Shut up . Marc , now , Neil , we got to find her . - Where do you think she went ? - Angela , Angela , Angela ! Where 's your dad ? I would like to begin by expressing my sincerest wishes ... for a speedy recovery of Mr Perry . I know I speak for everyone here in expressing my shock in what happened ... and admiration for the courage you 've shown in continuing this campaign . Thank you , Senora Reyes . I really do appreciate that . And I suppose I should consider myself lucky that that fellow had such a lousy aim . Guess he 's not from Texas . There 's a ... There 's a couple of things we should talk about here tonight , you and I. First one is , it 's time for a new kind of government . Don 't you think ? Yeah . Maybe he still has nano-bugs in his blood and they fought it off . - How can you know ? Why ? - I don 't know . Competing Synthetics , competing Sentients , maybe . Kurt , get with the goddamn programme here . This is all we got . See ? Now something fought that shit off and that something 's inside of me . I got about less than an hour to save my wife , so you move it ! I 'm on it . Paige has been taken over by Skin . We don 't have much time . They think Chuck 's blood contains remnants of the nano-bugs ... that turned him Synthetic , and they 're toxic to Skin . Wait a minute . You have a vial of Chuck 's blood in your refrigerator ? - I know , very Hannibal Lecter , isn 't it ? - What 's that for ? To shoot Paige Taggart full of Chuck 's nano-bugs . One that is ... One that is responsive to the needs of the unfortunate ... while protecting the honest Americans , hardworking Americans ... that are just trying to do right by our kids . Yeah . You know what I 'm talking about . The fabric of our society is held together by families . Hardworking , tax paying , morally upright families . As you would say , Senora Reyes , la familia . And my job is to protect those families ... from an overbearing government ... that would have them lose their birthright of freedom . Paige ! Dad ! Mom ! Mom ! - Dad ! - Get back , Neil ! Give me that ... Give me that gun , Kurt ! Someone call an ambulance now ! Let me ... Fire ! Fight it . Fight it . Fight it . Fight that stuff ! Fight it . Fight it . Fight it . Fight it ! Fight it off ! Fight it off ! Fight it ! Fight it ! Fight it ! Paige . Come here , baby . Come here . Come here , baby . - Paige . Paige . - Chuck . Hang on , now . Hang on . Hang on . Hang on . I 'm sorry . I should 've believed you from the very beginning . This is the beginning , baby . This is the beginning , right now . This is the beginning . This is the beginning . This is you and me . I love you , Chuck . - I love you . - Marc . - Marc 's gonna be fine . - You take care of Marc . Marc 's gonna be fine . Just hang on . Don 't go . Paige ? Paige ? I guess no one knew she had a heart condition . She was only 43 . I really feel for those boys . Yeah . It must be hard losing a parent like that , so suddenly . - Hey . - Hey . - Hi , Aunt Jenny . - Neil . You have to talk to Dad . Believe me , Neil . He doesn 't want to talk to me . - I 'm here for you and Marc . - Yeah . There 's been too much of that in this family . It 's got to stop , and now is as good a time as any . I just wanted to say again how sorry I am . - Thank you . - Everyone here tells me ... how much a part of the NASA family your wife was . Well , in the early days , she was like a single mother raising two boys . She was an astronaut 's wife , part of history . I just ... I wish we hadn 't been on opposite sides of the fence . Right now , it feels like none of that really matters much . No . - I 'm sorry . - Thank you . - Aunt Jenny 's here . - Where ? She 's right ... Well , she was there . - Where 's your brother ? - I haven 't seen him . Marc ? This is your fault . You and him . You and your fucking secrets and your new friends ... and whatever the fuck else you 're into . It got Mom killed , and you fucking know it . Marc , don 't do this . Not today . Your only interest in your sons is how they reflect on you . You 're a fucking liar . You 're a fucking liar , Dad . You never cared about anybody but yourself . Marc . Dad . Don 't listen to him . He doesn 't understand . He doesn 't know . Maybe , there 's just ain 't no way to do this right , is there ? It don 't matter if it 's five years gone ... or five years in the future . It 's ... Life is just a big bowl of shit , ain 't it ? It 's Chuck . Hey . Hey , you 're late . Are you okay ? Yeah . I had some details to attend to . There was a will and Paige had some jewellery she wanted given away ... and shit like that . It was a beautiful service . Yeah . She would 've liked it . She touched a lot of people . So , how are you holding up , Chuck ? How am I holding up ? Well ... it 's like my dog won 't hunt , got a horse who 's lame , pickup 's broke ... and the crops are rot . Other than that , jim-dandy . Why don 't you come sit down ? Have something to drink , something to eat ? No , you sit down . I just came to say , adi√≥s . Hey , this is a non-smoking establishment . Son , I don 't want to rumble with you . Besides , today ain 't your day . Kurt , I think I owe you an apology . You were right . Because I think we ought to spend the next five years eating red meat ... getting drunk and going to the track . Because this is a war we ain 't going to win . - Chuck , you don 't know that . - Yeah , I do . For all we know , we 're already fucked . World 's going to explode any second . And you know something ? I think it damn well should . - Chuck , that 's bullshit and you know it . - Do I ? Like the Good Book said : " They have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind . " Yeah , well , that 's not you talking , Chuck . That 's bitterness . Bullshit . It 's clarity . Man 's a source of his own goddamn problems ... and we brought this shit down on ourselves . My wife suffocated on the floor of the Houston Civic Centre in front of 500 souls . Who take the whole fucking ball of wax for granted . Who ain 't got a fucking clue what we 've been doing , trying to save their sorry ass . Then again , who knows ? Maybe we already stopped the end of the world and my wife died for nothing . That there 'd be a real bitch , wouldn 't it ? Chuck , it 's just going to take time to get over this . Sarah , time is one thing we all know we ain 't got . - Son , you take care of yourself . Adi√≥s . - Where you going ? - I couldn 't tell you . - Chuck , Chuck , Chuck ! Chuck , listen to me . Listen to me . You said it yourself . Nobody does anything alone . You 're an integral part of this puzzle . It 's that simple . Without you , we can 't go on . Kurt . Right now I wish the air had run out on that shuttle , I swear to God ... and that skinny little fucker had never saved us and sent us back here . I mean , he must be having some laugh on our hands right now . He sent us back here to save the world and all we 're doing is raining havoc ... on everybody we ever loved . I know I have . I ought to have died up there . At least I 'd have died with five years of beautiful memories of my wife . And right now I 'm looking down at a whole world with misery . You hear me ? Misery , without her . I 'm out of here . I understand , Chuck , but you just can 't walk away . Kurt , I 'm not walking away . I 'm gone . Hey , buddy . Hey . Let me put it this way , brothers and sisters . When the world blows up again ... all I want this time is a front row seat . Senator , given the internal opposition within NASA ... we feel the prudent course of action is to move the project ... out of government hands and into a private corporation . Well , how the hell are we going to maintain any kind of control ? Well , the budget will be drawn from an undisclosed line-item in the DOD . Nobody will be able to connect you . I heard your bullshit before . Now that I pulled a bullet out of my shoulder ... you 'll forgive me if I 'm a little sceptical . Senator , this will put even greater distance between you and the project . Bright Sky is still your project . We just need you to sign off on the move . Do it .

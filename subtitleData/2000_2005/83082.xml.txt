 taking a bath is great ! It 's such a great feeling ! it 's Uncle Utsugi ! Hello ? Uncle ! Honey . The other day I finally found that thing I told you about . Dr. Kisaragi gave it to me ... . Who are you ? Uncle ? What are you doing ? Uncle ? What 's going on ? I can 't stay here ! HONEY FLASH ! Oh no ! Not enough energy ! What am I going to do ? ! I don 't have any clothes ! This 'll have to do ! Garbage bag ? Thank you very much ! stomach 's full now ! I think it 'll work now ! HONEY FLASH ! Dispatch confirmed ... Aqualine route confirmed All units mobilized ... . Perfect . Like a cornered rat . Chief ! Chief ! Status report ! Currently Dr. Utsugi is still unharmed . The kidnapper 's demands ? Nothing yet . What are those idiots thinking ? I 'll talk to them directly . You perps there ! Release the Professor and give yourself up immediately ! Do you think you can escape ? How boring ... Not even worth my time . What 's that ? I can 't hear you . You 're naive ! I said you 're naive ! You think you can defeat Panther Claw with this ? Panther Claw ? Indeed ! will play with you ! Boss ! A battle is determined by numbers and strength ! Fire ! She 's gone ! That was dangerous ! Are you alright ? I 'm glad ! Go ! Hey you ! Don 't butt in ! I can handle a situation like this myself ! I 'm sorry ! Geeze ! These guys are persistent ! What ? ! The Professor got away ! What 's that ! ? A traitor ? ! He hit me ! Idiot ! After them ! There he is ! We found him ! we 've captured the professor . You made us waste time ! Exsqueeze me . We have the professor here . Give yourselves up immediately ! Don 't be ridiculous ! Keep your nonsense to yourself ! The professor is right here ... That is Professor Utsugi ! But then ... You ! You 're not Professor Utsugi ! Panther Claw . HONEY FLASH ! Who are you ? ! Panther Claw ? At times a bike racer . or a stand in for Professor Utsugi . my true identity is ... Cutie Honey ! prepare yourself ! this might be amusing ! Not bad little girl . My turn now ! Any time ! GOLD ATTACK ! That wasn 't nice . Alright ! Why you ! Little girl ! I 'm done playing now ! GOLD MISSILE ! Why you ! Hey ! ? The Professor ... . but I have to deliver this guy . Farewell ! Little girl ! You 're not getting away ! HONEY BOOMERANG ! No way ! You 're kidding ! Uncle ! he 's only unconscious . That 's good ! Detective Aki Natsuko . I 'm taking you in . brought into custody . false arrest ... . Who 're you ? Hayami Seiji . What are you ? Newspaper reporter . Why 's a civilian here . And the media no less . Dunno ... bring him in too . Yes . Unecessary roughness ... There 's no need for this . come with me . you planning on escaping ? Yup ! I 'm late ! See yah ! HONEY FLASH ! my only lead ... . And so I have to walk to it ! Good Morning ! Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . It 's not good morning anymore . It 's good afternoon now . Yes . Good morning . Can someone do something about her ? Would someone fire her ? These youngsters nowadays ... . So irresponsible . Yes ? Excuse me ! I 'll help right away ! Will you stop that and get to work ? Yes ! pass out the tea . right away ! Let 's see ... who needs it most first ... . your tea . Here . I 'm done ! you 're useless ! first it 's the boss . Next his assistant . Then the head supervisor . And his assistant . And then your supervisor . And then the rest by seniority . when are you going to learn how things are done here ? everyone would enjoy it . Are you stupid ? How old do you think you are ? It 'll be almost a year since I was reborn . What ? I can 't figure you out . I think she should be fired . You expect us to believe that ? But this is a fact . Please read my report . The Tokyo Aqualine was heavily damaged . Repairs will be significant . The criminals involved were not arrested . We don 't have a single lead . It 's turned into a massive disgrace ! We 're under constant pressure . The serial abductions of beautiful women are unsolved and the media is having a field day . My head hurts just thinking about it . Perfect . coffee ? I don 't need it . what can we ... Just wait for further orders . I 'm counting on you . Here 's 5 onigiri . Thanks ! when did I start taking work in exchange for onigiri ? here 's 3 onigiri as a present . please . Here 's 3 onigiri and ... . But ... I like onigiri . I guess it 's okay ! Good job ! Where do you want to go for dinner ? Want to catch a movie ? everyone 's got it so nice . I want to go out and play too . But you know ... I gotta finish today 's work . Overtime again ? Yeah . I can 't turn them down when they give me onigiri . huh ? Yeah . for you . Wow ! Thanks as usual ! yummy ! your homemade ones are always great ! Auntie . Help me ? Thanks ! Kitty ! You came today too ! you listening ? I should call Uncle . Professor Utsugi is currently unavailable . He is currently with Panther Claw . you should just give it up and hang up . What ? ! What 's that ? ! Taken from right under our noses . That 's why I can 't leave things to others . Ms. Aki Natsuko ... . need some clues ! Let 's do it ! Kisaragi ! Where 's Kisaragi ? She 's not here . Seems she 's going to be late . Again ? ! What 's up with her ? ! Detective Aki Natsuko . Don 't expect me to give you a leak . I don 't want the people above to come down on me like you . Chief ! Could I get your signature on this ? just who I wanted to see . Get me the public notice . Huh ? Just now ... . What ? Proof ? What 're you asking me for ? Don 't know a thing . Give it up ! And I figured the police would at least have some clues . young miss . you 're that guy ! I thank you for that . Hayami Seiji . Pleased to meet you . S-same here . by far cuter than I 've heard . The name Cutie Honey is most appropriate ! Oh my my my ! There 's no need to use the I System . How do you know about that ? It 's my business . Discovering the truth is my job . What are you here for ? To tell you about clues . Why for me ? Because I 'm on your side ! On my side ? Those soldiers you defeated mysteriously vanished . And their abilities we saw exceeded human capabilities . That was due to the nano-machines that were fused into their bodies . You should know about those . I 'm pretty sure I heard about some system like that somewhere . Is it ... . That 's right ! the development of his research . It 's the same as the AI system . So could it be that 's what Panther Claw is after ... . Exactly . and then the kidnapping of Professor Utsugi who continued his research ... . That 's why father was killed ? And now Uncle Utsugi ? And so ... . want to know more ? I want to know ! from here on it 'll be a business deal . Then what were we doing up to now ? A token of my thanks . So what 's the business deal ? An exclusive interview . That 's my condition . I 'd like to ask you something too . Nat-chan ? it 's Nat-chan ! Nat-chan ! Nat-chan ! the secret organization Panther Claw . they use any means in order to satisfy their desires . They 're radical egotists . And have a vast array of weapons integrated into their bodies . They have a group of unbelievable soldiers . So that 's the secret organization Panther Claw ? Who 's the leader ? She 's called Sister Jill . Sister Jill ... . Mistress Sister Jill . It is indeed an honor . What ? You 're going by yourself ? Of course ! This is a job for the police . let me give you a ride to headquarters . I 'll walk . The basis of investigation is leg work . I 'll work with you ! No need . I said I 'll work with you ! Pesky . Meanie . we 're off . The only thing you can count on is the system . follow the plan . Mistress Sister Jill . I am pleased to be witness to your beauty . 222nd reawakening . We humbly present to you ... our undying service . Black Claw . Cobalt Claw . Gold Claw . Scarlet Claw . 000 soldiers . I present to you a years worth of fresh human women . weapons made of solid gold ! the Jill Tower . you need only to command it . We will fulfill it immediately . We take our leave . Boring . Nothing has changed in this tiring world . There is one additional thing I would like to inform you about . So it 's Panther Claw . but they involved Uncle Utsugi too ? Do you find it unforgivable ? Of course ! Vengeance is a futile endeavour . You should give it up . What do you mean ? Hate doesn 't suit you . I don 't think your father would be happy . Then why should I ? You 'll have to discover that for yourself . Cheapskate . you 're their focus and I 'm sure they 'll attack again . Be careful . Don 't underestimate them . Looks like someone 's following us . Quite obviously too . no problem . They have no idea . They 've put on their hazards . Looks like they 're stopping . a woman is getting out . What should we do ? She 's waving ! Follow the woman . Roger that ! Follow her ! Oh no ! See ya ! Oh no ! It 's this late already ! That light ... She couldn 't be ... . an unknown woman called Cutie Honey ? She seems matched in ability to those four and has been fighting them . She seems to possess a similar system . Interesting . Find her . As you wish . Professor Kisaragi 's daughter died in an accident a year ago . I know that . But we know that daughter holds the key to the I System . Contact me when you 've got something . it 'll be sometime soon . what next ? Good Morning ! It 's not good morning ! It 's even past good afternoon ! why are you here ? right ? Detective Aki Natsuko . There 's no question about it . It 's the woman detective that was at the scene with that girl . There 's probably some connection . What an unrefined report . That 's fine . we 'll just get rid of her . weren 't you eating an onigiri yesterday morning ? right ? Ms. Kisaragi 's staring again . Seriously scary ! It 's because she doesn 't have any friends to talk to . There 's someone here to see you ! isn 't it ? Yup ! Nat-chan ! Bye ! Why 're you running away ? Could it be because you 're feeling guilty ? not at all ! I 'd like to ask you some questions . But I 'm in the middle of work right now . Here 's no good . Over here . dear . You 've finally made a friend ! Here ! black . what a snob . Then I 'll have it . About the other time ... . No ! I 'll never break up ! Pathetic . I hate women that cry ! I got it already . right ? How stupid ! my mascara 's running . What are you doing here ? Get back to work ! idiot ! I 'm sorry ! Here 's no good either . Come with me . okay ... . what should I do about the next guy ? here 's the problem . I 've checked the Public Safety databases on you . There isn 't a single thing about you . Just who are you ? What 's your relation with Cutie Honey ? Who 's that journalist ? Where 's this Panther Claw ? You 're going to tell me everything right now . Use any means to achieve your goal . That 's a great phrase . Geeze ... Who the hell could this be ? Hayami Seiji . You ! How 'd you get my cell number ? ! Investigating 's my job . you shouldn 't go off on your own ! The enemy 's already watching you . What are you talking about ? Panther Claw ! The door is closing . butt out ! I can take care of this situation myself . I 'm sorry . But what the heck was that ? Someone you know ? but I don 't know ... . I don 't know ... . Fishy ... Definitely fishy ! You 're going to tell me everything at HQ ! What the heck ? ! Nat-chan ! You can 't get away now ! Now hurry and tell me about Honey . Otherwise ... tell me . That 's what I want to know ! wrong answer ! HONEY FLASH ! Prodigieux ! You ! Are you Panther Claw ? Bullseye ! One of the four of Panther Claw . along with your neck ... will be taking it ! I 'll never give it to you ! Cutie Honey ... is that girl ? I will have what I want ! Our desire and pleasure This is our style . What style ? You should consider others ! Gotcha ! Tres bien ! What a wonderful scream ! That 's the reason why I cannot give up killing people . You ! Is this how you killed my father a year ago ? What 's that ? do you remember what you ate a year ago ? Panther Claw ! I 'll never forgive you ! you know . but heat does not agree with me . It 's hot ! how does that feel ! No ! It hurts ! It hurts ! You okay ? That 's good ! This is NOT good ! What the hell is going on ? ! What about Honey ? but it 's getting hot ! That 's not good ! We have to transform her back ! Nat-chan ! Hold on ! Counting on me ? ! Hey you ! You have to shut off your transformation circuit ! No ! If I stop now I won 't get revenge for my father ! Stop it ! Criminals have to be arrested ! Stop it now ! Shut up ! I 'll never forgive them ! Ms. Honey 's anger and hatred has appeared to have burnt Cobalt Claw to crisp . I have no interest in the weak . However ... Ms. Honey 's radiance ... does it interest you ? It appears Professor Kisaragi was successful in making the nano-machines disassemble and reassemble matter on a quark level . It would be ideal for granting me eternal life . To think there is a human capable of this . I cannot scorn this world . This is the first time you have smiled . I have no need for such inferior things . it limits her activity . So this his her weak point after all . You awake ? Thanks ! You saved me ! Under the circumstances ... Wow ! I didn 't really want to bring you here . about that thing of yours ... . I don 't really want to talk about it . It was a present . From my father . My body was destroyed in an accident a year ago . But I was reborn . the I System . I System ? the Imaginary Induction System . This choker 's part of it . you 're a robot ? You 're an android ? I don 't believe it . I 'm just the same as a human . This body is a copy of my previous body . But I don 't have any memories from then . The only memory I have of my father is of holding his hand . right ? First outsider to know of Honey 's true identity ... . I suppose that 's fine . for getting you mixed up in this . it 's just part of my job . I finally realized today ... The feeling of hating someone is really frightening . The feeling of loving someone is just as frightening . then I think I 'd rather love someone . I see ... Is this what Seiji was talking about ? Go to sleep already . Good night . My body seems to be fading . I must have the I System soon . Mistress . What 's this ? ! I 'm glad ! They 're blooming ! Nat-chan ! You should just butt out ! Say ... Say ... Why ? But they 're blooming now . right ? Yeah . The I System can revive living things . But it cannot create new life . That 's why I like living things . It doesn 't have any meaning . Unless you take care of them yourself and make them bloom . I 'm sorry . right ? Then would you leave . \ fry0 ) } Sailor Spork Presents ... 0 ) \ a5 \ fs50 \ 4cH000000 \ bord0 } Translation + Timing : taroroot { \ a5 \ fs50 \ 4cH000000 \ bord0 } Songs / Mux / Type / Edit : Apterous { \ a5 \ fs35 \ 4cH000000 \ bord0 } Raw : Guchi Jnr @ Public MM Torrents En Vogue girl A small bottomed girl Honey Come on ... just a little bit oh please don 't hurt my feelings It 's making my heart race ...

It 's coming together . you can 't count on the system . Ms. Aki Natsuko ... . There 's no need for you to continue this useless investigation . You 'll be assigned to the serial kidnapping case . Why is that ? The American Government is taking over . They 're going to conduct the investigation on the Professor . So I 'm going to take the blame ? Of course you are . There isn 't anything else you can do . Seems we expected too much from the youth of nowadays . This is your punishment . Hold it . We 'll take your firearm . I don 't have any clues to go on . There 's nothing I can come up with by myself . I just have to believe and rely on others ! Welcome ! So ? What did you want to talk about ? let 's not be so formal . here . Sake ? Nat-chan . Your favorite flower is the cosmos . Your favorite word is " perfect " . And your favorite drink is Japanese sake . Specifically this locally brewed sake from Yamaguchi . The kind of men I hate are journalists . And unfortunately I only drink alone . Just like your work . How sad . I wish you 'd understand the feelings of a man who went through all this trouble . GOOD MORNING ! What 're you doing here ? I called Seiji and he said to come right over . Did I do something wrong ? Just your timing . but sorry Nat-chan ! Whatever . I 've decided not to have anything to do with you . But fate has brought us together again . Fate ? It 's that journalist 's scheme . What ? But since were reunited now ... . Pesky ! just by myself then . Nat-chan should enjoy life more . As long as you 're alive you know ? Will you shaddap ! When did she start drinking ? And she 's drinking like a fish ! Is she okay with alcohol ? guess we 'll find out . Doesn 't look good ! For crying out loud ! I 've told you I hate women that cry ! Nat-chan ! There ! Cut it out ! There there there ! There there there there ! There ! Oh yeah ! I should see what a man 's room is like ! Hey Honey ! Not in there ! Honey ! Here we go ! you 're really collecting data ! Something 's up with those two ... . Like a fish ... . Like a fish ... . I can 't stand it ! I can 't take it anymore ! I 'm gonna sing . you got karaoke ? Karaoke ? isn 't it ? You should set it up ! Sorry bout that ... . you ! Do that Honey Flash thing and make some karaoke . KA-RA-O-KE ! That 's enough already ! That 's enough ! I 'm tired ! It seems Ms. Honey has a heart just like humans . And it seems she has a considerable attachment to Professor Utsugi . it should be simple to come up with a plan to bring her here . This is serious ... . I stay overnight and wake up with a hangover . this is the pits ! how degrading . Don 't just add to someone 's monologue ! it 's just that I 'm picking up on your habits . Shut up ! Butt out ! See ! Honey ? Where 's Nat-chan ? Do you think Nat-chan hates me ? No . She 's just confused . she doesn 't know how to act . You 're so straightforward she doesn 't know how to handle you . Then what about me ? Honey should be Honey . That 's all ! Here ! Ms. Kisaragi Honey . we extend an invitation to three to visit us at Jill Tower . Wait ! Where 's that ? The details are in your invitations . we request formal attire . If you 'll excuse me . Invitations for three . That means ... The one more is ... I hope this will be useful . you can get a release for a lot . Remember that . Sir ! But what if the supervisors find out ? The supervisors only see a desk . Just fill out the paperwork and they 'll never know . Remember that ! Sir ! And here 's that man 's true identity . This guy was quite a pain to look up ! About the only thing I 'm good at is hacking . I see now . It makes sense now . Thanks you two . Thanks ... . That 's the first time I 've heard that . Let 's remember this moment ! I 've got a little something to take care of . Let 's split up here . Okay . Seiji ! 'K then ! Later then ! Alright then ! I 've got to dress up too ! Hey ! Nat-chan ! You look so cute ! So you came . what 's with your hair ? And you 've left the tag on ! It 's no good ? I couldn 't do my hair myself . finger perm ... . Couldn 't you just use your Honey Flash ? I 've decided to stop cheating . right ? You 're hopeless . Come over here . you 're great ! Of course . I 've worked hard at doing everything myself . Your something else ! done . Thanks ! Nat-chan ! That 's alright . No it 's not ! Nevermind ! It 's not good ! these don 't have any prescription ! They 're just for show ! Be quiet ! okay ? I thought you were going to stop cheating . For myself . But for everyone else I 'll do anything ! But you 're cute without them too ! Who asked you . Here ! I 'll rescue the Professor by myself . But we should together ... . but I 'll find my own way in . But ... . Nat-chan ! Good luck Nat-chan ! Later ! Now then ! Let 's go ! This time I will bring that little girls head . Mistress ! There is no need for you to go . Mistress Sister Jill ! It is true that it was my fault that that little girl defeated me ! But this time I will not fail ! How unsightly . To plead for one 's life denies perfection . It 's just as well . it is set . It 's time . The Tokyo Tower ! Who 's there ? We 've been waiting . Ms. Honey . Panther Claw ! Where 's Uncle Utsugi ! is right over there . Uncle ! Uncle ! Not to worry . We 've only inquired about the I System directly from his brain . You didn 't ! His memories ... We 've stolen them . He would be happier without those memories . Uncle ! Hang in there ! It 's me ! It 's Kisaragi Honey ! Uncle ... That watch was fathers . Uncle ! Oh my . it appears love remains . Of course ! Love ... you 'll never be able to steal our love ! We will be holding him . At the end of this path . you will find before you ... These obstacles . Then I 'll defeat you ! All of you ! Do you think you can ? Can you ? I 'll show you ! HONEY FLASH ! Wonderful ! This radiance ! I will surely bring it to Mistress Jill ! Panther Claw ! I 've got to hurry and find the Professor . girl . I won 't allow you any further . Scarlet Claw ... Will be taking your head ! Now that 's startling ! What a wonderful view ! A wonderful view ! my Scarlet Beam ! don 't you think ? Girl ... that 'll mean their view will get even better ! Now then ... It 's about time for me to take that head of yours . Ow ow ow owie ! Look what 's happened to me ! Why you ! I 'll remember this ! I 'll get you ... over there ! Yeah ! So this is the true form of Jill . they have become very similar to plant cells . That completes my job . But I 'm going to go ahead and use this here . Black Claw ! why didn 't you continue fighting ? It 's your turn now ! Hurry up and kill that girl ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! How unrefined . You have been released from your uglyness . that is an eternal pleasure . steadfastly And answer this gaze . My desire will be satisfied . I am ... The strongest warrior ... hits the stage ! I 'll omit the second verse . Honey calls ! you okay ? I 'm done with my little detour . I 'll reach the tower soon . I 'm going ahead . We have to rescue the Professor as soon as possible . What 's that ? They 're women that were being held here . So they were responsible for the serial kidnappings too ? Yeah . They were being used by Jill 's and were being held by her main body . I 've set them free . I used anti-nano machines to lower Jill 's activity levels and free them . Superb ! Honey ! Such fighting strength . Such pleasure ! This may be a first ! kindle my desire even more ! I 'm sorry ! it 's Go Nagai ! ) BLACK TORNADO ! You won 't escape ! Panther Claw ! release Professor Utsugi ! That 'll be fine . However ... There is one condition . DON 'T ! Nat-chan ! NATSUKO ! Let us continue this enjoyment ! That is the supreme pleasure ! Running out of energy ... . you did well . I compliment you . father ... Protect me ! No ! I ... I 'm getting dizzy ! and darkness I shall never fail ! Farewell . HONEY BOOMERANG ! I have to go ... . I have to go ... . I 'm here ! Now return my Uncle ! he has already been released . Uncle ! she will take his place . Nat-chan ! Never mind me and just get out of here ! But I wonder about her . To present the I System is my sole objective . Just get out of here ! Get out of here ! I 'm not going to run . Nat-chan . Just butt out already ... . Could this also be love ? That is enough . Mistress ! Cutie Honey . You 're Sister Jill ? Correct . I have been given . I am ... Sister Jill . That I System you possess is wonderful . But how is your determination ? You have the same power of eternal life as I do . Why do you stay with these humans . I have no need for that ! What a regrettable existence . then that is fine . I will take over that power . is most appropriate . cross over to me . once more has been reawakened . I give you my thanks ! Cutie Honey ! will become one with me . You will be able to live for eternity with me . That 's fine . release Nat-chan . As you wish . Save Nat-chan . Help Nat-chan ... . please ... . save Nat-chan . save Nat-chan . Stop . Stop it !

That 's more than enough . Honey ! I take it back ! Let 's work together ! Your choker ! HONEY FLASH ! This is my father 's love . I do not understand . why waste it ? Is this is your heart and soul ? It 's not just mine . It 's everyone 's . It 's everyone 's feeling of love . is it ? How can I posses it ? is beyond my comprehension . It 's simple .

 How 's that , Challenger ? Give it a try . You on the other hand get lost ! Here we go I hope ! Any luck ? We 'll soon have enough water in the tree house ... more than you could ever wish for . If you can heat it , Marguerite will love you . That 's the easy bit ... Sounds like a T-rex coming our way . I don 't think so . Hey ! Water , water everywhere ! We put together the outer pipe fix ... and now we can star filling the tank for the tree house . Marguerite ? Roxton ? - Inland sea the other way . - I wonder who it could be ? Good Lord ! Is that a person ? Come on ! More fire , Malone ! We must be nuts . That 's a relief , it 's not human . Challenger ! What on earth ? Who would do a thing like this ? I don 't know . Raptor is not exactly my idea of an entr√©e . It looks like something out of a medical school completely disemboweled . And look at this . What kind of a knife is that ? Malone ? What is it , Malone ? At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World What 's that ? It 's a woman . - What have you done ? - What have you done ? - It 's the Ripper ! - he 's got a knife ! It 's the Ripper ! It 's the Ripper ! It 's the ripper . Do I saw him . - He is right ! - It 's Jack the Ripper we 've got him lads . Come on , come on , come on ! - Where did he go ? - He can 't be far away . a coachman , the ripper is a bleeding coachman . ... upstairs ... - There he is . - He 's at that bridge . We got him lads , we got him . Malone ! It 's all right Malone . It 's me , Challenger . Get that knife away from me ! The knife ? Oh keep breathing , deep breaths . I was in London , I was running for my life . - They were trying to kill me . - London ? - Who was trying to kill you . - A mob of workers . They said I was Jack the Ripper ! The infamous killer who stalked the east end of London ! Are you saying this knife conjured images of his horrendous murders ? There was a dead woman in an alleyway . I had that knife in my hand . Oh God ! It was a nightmare ! I was dressed like a ... - like a coachman ! - Coachman ? John Netley . A coachman in the service of Queen Victoria . - Good heavens ! - I don 't understand . Challenger ? What 's going on ? What happened ? I can 't know , Malone . It seems that during your stay away from us you 've ... developed powers you never had before . You mean like my headaches . And the dreams I 've been having since you brought me back ! Yes , it could be part of it all . It 's possible that during your ... stay in the so-called spiritual world , you tapped into its supernatural powers ... it 's seems to me you have developed some sort of a sixth sense . What are you saying ? I 've become psychic ? Psychometry is the ability to receive ... facts or impressions about a person from objects they once possessed . Are you saying that knife once belonged to Jack the Ripper ? Well , it 's possible . Which means it was used to commit five brutal murders . - But I was the Ripper ! - Not . Not you . The coachman John Netley was one of a number of ... suspects in these as yet unsolved homicides . When you touched the knife , somehow you managed ... to capture the persona of the killer . But how would Jack the Ripper 's knife get here on the plateau ? Well , that 's a question for these people we 're trying to follow , if we ever find them , two of them would you say ? Yeah , walking around in circles . I assume they are trying to make their way to their camp . Oh no ! Now they 've split up . What do we do now ? If we continue like this , we are going to be as lost as they are . Quite so , I suggest we make our way back to ... the tree house , get the others , and mount a proper search . Good idea . Hello up there ! Anybody home ? - Who is it ? - I 'm a doctor . William Gull . My expedition was attacked by dinosaurs . Everyone fled in panic and I got lost in the shuffle . Stay right there . I 'll be right down . Oh . Don 't touch the electric fence . It does a pretty good job of keeping out unwanted dinosaurs . Really very ingenious , As I was saying , my companions and I , we came here several months ago ... to study the fabulous plant and animal life . - How far away is your camp ? - Well , I don 't know . We were attacked by a T - Rex . We just abandoned every thing . I 'm ... really quite lost . Our camp was ... was in the jungle . It was in the shadow of a small range of mountains . That 's just a couple of miles from here . Come on I 'll help you find it . - That 's very generous of you . - Not at all . Let 's go . It 's not exactly Brighton Beach , but it is a lovely day . Aren 't you glad we came ? I suppose I should say , we should come here more often . We should do it every day . Come on . Let 's go for a swim ! - Without a bathing costume ? - Why not ? We 're all alone . - It wouldn 't be the first time . - True ! But I hardly knew you then . Three weeks and four days , to be exact . And I must say , I was surprised to see how bold you were . Well , I was similarly impressed by ... what a gallant gentleman you could be , standing watch on the banks on the river , resolutely looking the other way . Took every ounce of restraint I had . Still does . All right . I promise to keep my eyes closed . Marguerite ! Maybe we can just ignore him , Or shoot him ! Who are you ? ! And that 's close enough ! I 'm terribly sorry to impose on you like this , - but you have to help me - What do you want ? - Where did you come from ? - I 'm Inspector Robert Anderson ... from Scotland Yard . You 're a little far from your precinct , aren 't you ? It 's a very long story . I 've been wandering around for days , chased by creatures I 've never imagined . Welcome to the Lost World . How did you get here ? Through a series of caverns a few days east of here . It 's the most horrible place I 've ever seen ! That 's what we thought when firs landed , We 've been trying to leave ever since . If you know a way off . - You can draw us a map . - Yes . All right , let 's start from the beginning . What 's an inspector from Scotland Yard doing in the jungles of ... - South America . - I 'm tracking a criminal . Perhaps the most notorious criminal the world has ever know . I 've been on this trail for thirty years . Thirty years ? - Who is this criminal ? - Not you I hope . Jack the Ripper . Veronica . Veronica . - Where is she ? - She might have gone for a swim , She often does this time of the day . I don 't see a note or anything . Do you have to put that thing right on the table ? Jack the Ripper was never apprehended , Malone . And now he could well be on the plateau . Huh-uh . There 's nothing you can say to make me ... touch that thing again , John , so don 't even try . For the sake of justice , if not science , you 've got to put your fear aside . If you can tell us who the Ripper is , you will have solved one of the greatest criminal mysteries of our times ! But then again , maybe you can 't read any more at all . Perhaps it 's just an isolated incident . Do you think so ? I mean I didn 't ask for this power . Of course not , I 'll be right beside you , my friend . I wouldn 't let you hurt yourself . But it saps my energy , Challenger . Can you prevent it from doing that ? I 'll knock it straight out of your hand if I have to . Maybe just one more time . Just to see if I still have it . That 's the spirit . What you poison doctor ? A pint of your best ale . I wouldn 't mind if you would . Not from these parts of town , I can see that straightway . I 've been tending a patient in the area . Poor woman . No much I could do for her . We all gotta go sometime . No use complaining ' . Does the doctor have a name ? Dr. William Gull . I am pleased to make your acquaintance . Do you fancy a lit ' company toni ' , doctor Gull . A proper gentleman like you know how to treat a lady I bet ... not like most of the ruffians that come here . Your attention is very flattering , Miss ... Catherine Eddowes But me friends call me Cathy . Cathy . It 's a pretty name . Pretty . Must be hard looking after the sick all day . The profession has its rewards . Course it does for a many like you . Why when me ma got sick , I had to take care of her night and day all by meself . Couldn 't afford no doctor , me just being a working girl an ' all . Must have been very hard . Oh it was . Still you 've got to do the best you can with what you got , that 's what I always say . Indeed . It 's been a pleasure talking to you , Miss Eddowes . But I really must go now . Are you sure I can 't change your mind ? Perhaps another time . Change your mind , now , Doctor Gull ? I 'm sure some fresh air will do us both good . Hmm . Do you live around here , do you , Cathy ? Just around the corner . Not much to look at . But it 's dry and warm . Well , that 's all that matters . You know , I might have a dram or two of whiskey in my bag . Oh , such a good doctor ! It 's all right , Malone . It 's all right ! You 're in the tree house . It was awful ! He was just about to stab her ! - You saw the Ripper again ? - Yeah . - But it was you , Challenger ! - Me ! You 'd better sit down . Now , start from the beginning . It was different than the first time . I saw you walking in to a pub . Doctor Gull you called yourself . Dr. William Gull was a prominent physician at the time . And the man most people believed to be the Ripper . Why would he look like you ? I don 't understand . Yes . That perplexes me as well . The first time it was you as John Netley , the coachman . And then Dr. Gull who looked like me . You 're still confusing things in your mind . It 's as though you 're mixing up faces with ... as in a dream or nightmare . But the gift ... the gift seems to be real enough . The gift is making me physically ill ! Yes . I can tell . You 're burning up . And your pulse is racing . Perhaps when this second sight is more ... fully developed , you won 't have these side effects . Fully developed ! You think I 'm ever touching that thing again ? This really is incredible . This latest vision of yours , concurs with a theory widely held at the time . This woman you saw Dr. Gull speaking to . Do you remember her name ? Oh God ! That was the worst part . She called herself Catherine ! Catherine Eddows . The Ripper 's fourth victim . But it wasn 't a streetwalker ! It was Veronica ! See your camp wasn 't that far at all , it 's not much left of it . Where is it ? - It 's must be here somewhere ! - What 's this all about ? We got hungry . Had to eat something . Where the hell are my instruments ? Looks like someone got to them before we did . I have to find them . You must help me . They could have been taken by anyone . There are lots of tribes on the plateau . Then let 's start with the ones that live in the immediate vicinity . Come on . Let 's get started . It 's going to be dark soon . It 's not a good idea to be wandering around in the jungle at night . I know all about the bloody dinosaurs ! I 'm not going back to that treehouse of yours without my instruments . I 'm not sure if I want you to come back to the tree house . How dare you talk to me like that ! Do you know who I am ? Obviously not the person I thought you were . If you want to wander around in the jungle all night , go right ahead . Come right back here , you hussy ! Don 't you ever touch me again ! - Are you ... ? - Don 't press your luck . And don 't try to follow me . Goodbye , Dr. Gull . You stop right where you are . You 're no better than the streetwalkers in London . So smart , so knowing . I told you not to touch me ! I 've been chasing Jack the Ripper for 34 years , first through Europe , then Africa , and now on the Amazon . And now to here , the very ends of the earth . How fortunate for us . Your dedication is remarkable . One must to pursue one 's passion . I 'm sure Lord Roxton can understand . Lord Roxton quite frankly is tired of your endless yammering . That was completely uncalled for ! My companion is not always as civil as he could be . That 's quite all right . You must be exhausted . Roxton , I think we should camp here for the night and continue in the morning . We 'll keep on going , thank you very much . What is the matter with you ? You 're behaving like a jealous schoolboy ! Jealous I am not ! However , your infuriating habit of fawning over ... every man you meet does leave me a trifle weary . Might I remind you that Inspector Anderson knows a way off the plateau ! Oh , please , Marguerite ! How many times do you have ... to fall for that stuffy refrain ! I 'll tell you what ! You go back to the tree house . I will stay and flirt with the handsome inspector ! Fine ! You 're on your own ! Fine ! I 'll see you in the morning maybe . Fine ! Fine ! I hope I 'm not the cause of any unnecessary conflict . No , not at all . Lord Roxton tends to be over protective . It 's charming in a quaint sort of way . This looks like as good a place as any . - Let 's start a fire . - Splendid idea ! I 'll get some firewood . And you met this Dr. Gull . He showed up here asking me to help find his camp . Good heavens . How old is he ? I 'd say late fifties . Are you telling me he really is this horrible killer ? That 's the right age , But what he 's doing here is baffling in the extreme . Well , He said he was here studying the plants and animals . More like mutilating and dissecting . Yes . I saw what he did to that raptor ! You were fortunate to get away from him . No , he was fortunate , If I 'd know who he was , he 'd be in need of reconstructive surgery himself . I missed you , Veronica . Your separation of right and wrong is refreshing . It is good to have our little family reunited , I agree . But we really must get to the bottom of this mystery . What mystery ? If this knife belongs to the disgusting doctor , all we have to do is catch him . If being the operative word , Veronica , Malone and I saw two very distinctive sets of ... footprints when we were tracking them . There 's someone else ? There 's more to this than we know . And I believe it 's all connected to this knife . Oh , no . No way ! I realise the physical danger , Malone . I don 't want to experience these horrible crimes again ! Nor do any of us ! Especially not here in this world , thus far untouched by such atrocities ! But we have an obligation ! Tea ? We seem to have started off rather on the wrong foot . If not that I don 't like you . I just don 't trust you . I don 't say I blame you , a woman like Marguerite is a rare treasure indeed . I don 't blame you for guarding her from other men . I most certainly would . Then consider yourself warned . I can see you are not a man to be trifled with . Feeling ill ? Perhaps you should lay down . Poison ! I poisoned you , yes . Very good . Marguerite will think you abandoned her . But don 't worry , The poison won 't kill you . Curare paralyses you , but leaves you completely conscious . We 'll be leaving this camp in the morning . But you won 't be able to stop us . or even to call up your lady loving . I 'll take you to where the tide comes in ... and when the tide comes in ... well , you can appreciate the horror ... of drowning slowly ... breath ... by suffocating breath . What a lovely victim you should be . Challenger , I hope you know what you 're doing . This machine will help me more accurately measure your heart rate , temperature and galvanic skin responses . If the reactions become too radical , we 'll take the knife away immediately . My life is in your hands , Challenger . Has anyone touched the body ? No , Inspector Anderson . She 's just like we found her , sir . Boy , nothing to see here . Cathy Eddows . Victim number four . Poor girl . What would you know about it ? Just like Scotland Yard to show up too late . Was this woman a friend of yours ? You could say that . Well , we all work together , don 't we ? Share horror stories about the blokes we meet late at night . And what kind of blokes might those be ? Fancy blokes , just like you . Well I 'm quite sure you ... never met anybody just like me . So , when was the last time you saw your friend ? Couple hours ago . I told her to go and sober up . She should have taken your advice . You know what I think , Inspector Anderson ? Scotland Yard don 't care about us working girls in the slums of London . If it had happened in Piccadilly or Regent Square , you 'd have him pretty quick . But then again , maybe it was one of you . A policeman . I see the way your lot looks at us as if we was merchandise . Yes , well , yours is a very dangerous occupation , Miss . Mary Jane Kelly , and I bet I come from finer stock than you , inspector . Well , it takes a certain type to fall this low , Miss Kelly . Perhaps you should come down to the yard and fill out a report . Not bloody likely ! Not with the likes of you . Think I can see where your eyes are traveling . You can come peacefully or otherwise , The choice is yours . That 's it ? No choice at all ? Very well . Wait ! Scotland Yard is the other way ! We 're taking the longer route . Lay a hand on me and I 'll scream . Oh , I don 't think you will . You see , you 're just a working girl . No one cares about the likes of you . There , there 's plenty more where that comes from . There 'd better be ! Ned ! It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're back . How do you feel ? Worse than before ! I think I 'm going to be sick ! Put your head between your legs ... and take deep breaths . That 's better . Pulse is coming back to normal . It 's no getting better Challenger , it 's getting worse every time . Here , How does that feel ? Better . This time I saw Roxton , but his name was Inspector Anderson . Anderson ! From Scotland Yard . He found the knife , he was wiping the blood off , talking to a woman who looked exactly like Marguerite ! Good heavens . Now all of us are back there . How ? I don 't understand ! He 's mixing up our faces with those involved in the crime . Now this Marguerite , did she have a name ? Mary Jane Kelly . The Ripper 's fifth and final victim . It 's incredible . Three times you have picked up this knife , and each time it has told you someone different was the killer . The coachman , the doctor , and now the inspector . - So which one was it ? - I don 't know ! Somehow your vision seem to be saying ... that all three of them must have held the knife and left their imprint on it . I say Dr. Gull is the killer . Well , perhaps . But we can 't rule out this other man who 's camping with him . Could be either of them . Roxton ! Roxton ! If this is your idea of a joke , it isn 't very funny ! Roxton , I 'm warning you . You come back here , right now ! Any sign of him ? No ! I don 't understand it . He wouldn 't just abandon me in the middle of the night . - Certainly not in the company of ... - A man like me . Well , yes . No offence , but ... Are you sure you didn 't see him leave last night ? He didn 't say anything to you after I fell asleep . Not a word . You suppose he headed back to this tree house of yours . Well He must have . Perhaps , perhaps we should continue on . Maybe we 'll catch up with him . I guess that 's all we can do . And when I find him I 'll have a few choice words that I haven 't used yet . Do you mind if we take a slight diversion on the way ? I 'd like to try find my camp . I suppose we could try . I 'd be most appreciative . I 'll leave a note for Roxton and Marguerite . Yes good idea , they should be back sometime today . Ready when you are . What are you doing ? We know Gull is looking for this knife . I thought it best not to leave this unattended . You look a little better today . You really had me worried last night . - I 'm all right . - Let 's get started . The sooner we find these people , the sooner we 'll get some answers . How many people were camped here ? Just me . You carried all this stuff by yourself ? A veritable pack mule , Who did that ? I was drying it for extra rations . I guess that 's what attracted the T-Rex . What are you looking for ? The Ripper 's knife , I took it from him some time ago . You took it from him ? How did you manage that ? Why don 't you try and help me find it ? What I would like is a straight answer or two ! Are you calling me a liar ? I don 't know what I 'm calling you ! But you 'd better start filling in the blanks ! And quickly . You shouldn 't draw a gun unless you are prepared to use it , Marguerite . Believe me , I will ! What did you do to Roxton ? I slipped some curare into his tea last night . Do you know what that is ? It 's a form of ... alkaloid strychnine that leaves you completely paralysed . But fully conscious . You almost tripped over him this morning . What ? You would have found him if I hadn 't led you away . By now the tide has come in and washed him out to sea . You rotten piece of filth ! Works better with bullets . I took the liberty last night in case it should come to this . You 're right , bullets would be way too easy . Dinner for the dinosaurs is much more appropriate . Roxton ! Roxton ! Roxton ! Roxton ! Roxton ! Roxton ! NO ! Don 't you dare leave me ! Come on , come on ! Oh , We 've got to stop meeting like this ! I 'm sorry , John . You were right about that horrible man . I 'll remind you of that , the next time you doubt my judgement . I never will , I promise ! Wake up , lad ! Where the hell have you been ? Is that any way to greet an old friend ? I 've been looking for you all over the place ! - Did you find the knife ? - Don 't you have it ! We 've got to find it ! We need it ! More than life itself ! There are tracks everywhere . It 's so confusing ! We 're never going to be able to find them , I mean , they could be anywhere by now . Malone , what are you doing ? You said so yourself . I 've got an obligation to used this cursed ... gift of mine to help anyway I can . What more do you think you could possibly learn from it ? I don 't know . Maybe nothing . But I 've got to try . Ned ! Ned , no ! Five young women killed in less than three weeks . Funny how the killings ended as suddenly as they began . Funny indeed , Inspector Anderson . You don 't suppose anyone will ever figure out who really did it . I don 't think even history will be able to tell . Yes . We 've covered our tracks very well , doctor Gull . To infamy . Better to rule in hell than serve in heaven . Your carriage awaits , gentlemen . Your trunks is already on board ship . Very good . I 've always wanted to see the continent . Very pleasant this time of the year . See , that 's the Ripper ! It 's him all right ! Look ! He was carrying the murder weapon in his pocket ! Get him ! Looks like it 's just the two of us , Dr. Gull . Pity , Inspector . A pity . Are you all right , Malone ? What did you see this time ? It was all of them , It was the doctor , and the inspector , and the coachman ! All three of them . That 's quite correct . - You ! - Don 't move . I won 't hesitate to shoot you this time . I see you found our knife . Inspector Anderson , I presume . Very clever . You animal ! Much worse than that I 'm afraid . I told you not to move , Now put your hands up ! Unfortunately John Netley died in London , leaving the two of us to carry on the Ripper 's work . If you hurt her , I 'll kill you both ! Oh , I don 't think so , laddy . What are you doing ? It 's a dinner invitation for the ravenous wildlife , it 's a little raptor blood . That is a very nice knife . I keep it around for scum like you . Let 's take a walk , Move it ! Don 't you hurt her ! All the comforts of home . I think I should enjoy living here . Who did she remind you of ? Watch up . She is our first victim here , in this ... wild uncharted world . Brutality is addictive you see . The more we kill , the more we need to kill . It gets in to the blood . Only one cure for a disease like that . Yes ! Of course you 're right . We 've got to get you back to the tree house ! And find Veronica . Shall we begin the operation ? Ready when you are . Doctor . If it 's a knife fight you want , prepare to meet your maker . Stay away ! This is for all the pain and suffering you 've caused . No ! What 's going on ? Ned ! Challenger ! You beat them both ? Well , I didn 't have a choice . What did I miss ? Only this . Just the best bit . Oh , This looks like hell on earth ! Not my first choice for a picnic , that 's for sure . No one ever comes here . The Zanga call it the angry place . Perfect end for this vile thing . Is it evil ? Or is it the hand of man that makes it so . Oh , I guess if just a knife like any other ... but every time I touch it , I see and feel the pain and suffering it 's caused . I never want to see that evil here again . Not on the plateau . So long , Jack the Ripper . May you live on only as a lesson to us all . *

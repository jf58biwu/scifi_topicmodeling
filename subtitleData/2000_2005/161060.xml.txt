 You 've been round long enough to guess how this little device works . I leave the premises , and it self-activates . Ten minutes later , I 'm looking for my head in the next galaxy . Something like that . You 're next . Thrilled . I 've interfaced with the monitoring system . We now have coverage of the whole sector Sergeant Viesidra is on line . Oh , yes ! It 's been a long night , filled with rare items , but this one is very different from the rest . Fleshy , but firm . Soft , yet still hard . For this fine drink of nitro , we should charge by the yard . Every bad ass in the underground is here , and me without my party dress . Got any ideas how to get this piece of jewellery off ? There 's a weak link in the device . Laser incision will extricate it from the throat . Just isolate the target , Sarge , and retrieve the pod . - We 'll take care of everything else . - Right . EDWYN COLLINS : A Girl Like You Whoa ! I 've never known a girl like you before Now just like in a song from days of yore You go , girl . Shake that moneymaker ! And I 've never met a girl like you before Bingo on Sluggo . Nice piece of work . Ugghh ! Who 's the Jenny Craig poster boy ? It 's not who he is , it 's what he 's got . Sluggo discovered the original design pod for the underground . So , he 's got a map ? The map . Every level , every corridor , every trap door . Everything . COMPUTER : Gauntlet charge activated . Plans to the Death Star . C ... - Cool ! - No , not c ... cool . He 's going to auction it off to that room full of mutant scum . Whoever has the pod controls the underground . Ah , so that 's why Voice wants it . Mm-hm . Is Sarge going to pick his pocket ? It 's not on him . It 's in him . You made me acknowledge the devil in me I hope to God I 'm talking metaphorically Hope I 'm talking allegorically Know that I 'm talkin ' ' bout the way I feel And I 've never known a girl like you before You know , your mother ... must be so proud . I think I want you . You want me , huh ? Well , that 's good . Cos I hear the fastest way to a man 's heart ... .. is through his chest ! Ugghh ! Good girl ! Goodbye , love handles . Goodbye , Sluggo ! He 's a droid . He 'll live . Agghh ! She 's got the pod ! What are you doing out here ? Kill her ! Hel ? Mauser ? Change of plan . Meet me at landing 29 , shaft T. My clock 's ticking - not the biological one . I 'm on my way . No , Helen . Send Cleopatra . Send Cleo ? - Send who ? - Voice ? - Oh , no , no , no , no , no . I ... I need more training , more conditioning . More gizmos for my gauntlets . I 'm not ready for this . Voice ? Am I ? 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth Are you on your way , Hel ? Come in , Hel ! We 're making a plan . - I 'm not sending Cleo . Don 't second-guess me on this one . Cleopatra has to go . She can do what needs to be done , and I need you here . Why ? You 'll understand . If you want this mission to succeed , you 've got to trust me . You 're running out of time . Do it . Load her . I 've loaded the graphic so it will free-float with you . You will have full gauntlet capacity . Think it , and it will trigger the mechanism . For the record , I have to say I am not behind the decision . Remember - your brain is the computer driving all devices . This is every known variable between the lab and Sarge 's egress point . You can learn this as fast as you can think it . Concentrate . Agghh ! Ugghh ! There 's a shaft around here somewhere . Agghh ! This is bad ! She better be there , Hel . Landing 29 , shaft T. Ughhh ! Agghhhh ! Landing 31 , shaft 6 . What 's a few floors and a sector between friends ? I want you ! OK , this is bad . MAN : Boo ! Get her off ! Sorry . There 's a guy over there Bam-bam , no-no He ain 't got any hair Da-da da-da Smells like an old shoe But what can I do ? I got the Mutant Bar blues It 's been a lot of Mutant Bar blues This place is so beneath me The guests , they make me queasy I got the slime-huggin ' , nose-pluggin' Time-for-me-to-get-runnin' Mutant Bar blues , yeah Bye . Oh ! Ugghh ! Ugghh ! Light a match when you 've done ! Ugghh ! Ugghh ! Where is she ? Damn ! Agghh , agghh , agghh ! Sarge ! Cleo ! Hurry up ! Come on , move it ! Sarge ! Agghh ! Ugghh ! No ! No ! For the record , I just want to say that I am not at all happy with this decision . Wrong . It is untimely , it is reckless , and you 're putting both Sarge and Cleo 's lives in jeopardy . I haven 't left ? Only in your mind . You can learn this as fast as you can think it . Concentrate . Shaft ahead in five , four , three ... Never mind ! She better be there , Hel . Landing 29 , shaft T. Landing 31 , shaft 6 . The stairs . Coming through ! Move it or lose it ! Big girl 's gotta make ! Why don 't you boys take a break ? Hi ! So , is anyone here from out of town ? Birthday in the crowd , perhaps ? No ? Anyone celebrating some kind of Darwinian evolution , perhaps ? Oh ... wow ! Here 's a face only a mother could love . Assuming your mother was a pig . Gotta go . Ugghh ! OK , so I 'll go shoe shopping . A girl could have worse problems . Where is she ? Damn ! Ugghh ! Cleo , move it ! - Sarge ! - I 'm running out of time ! Just line it up and take the shot ! Take your shot ! Agghh ! Ugghh ! Ugghh ! Ugghh ! Ugghh ! No ! Wrong again . Sarge , change of plan . Cleo 's on her way . What ? You 're sending Cleo ? Send her . Have you run it through in your head ? Know what you 're doing ? I could run it 1 00 times and still not know . Send her , or we lose the pod for ever . Not to mention Sarge . Send her ! If Voice thinks I can do it , I guess I can do it . OK , Cleo . Run . Agghh ! This is not the time for training . Sarge is in trouble . Cleopatra will get the pod . What about Sarge ? Cleopatra will get the pod . - That 's not good enough . You 've got your priorities , I 've got mine . She better be there , Hel . Landing 29 , shaft T. Don 't sweat it , Sarge ! I 'm right behind her . That 's my girl . Go . Go . Go . I saw this in a movie once . Nice work , little sister . Come on , move it ! Sarge ? Catch this ! I 'm running out of time ! Take the shot ! No ! You take the shot ! Oop ... Catch ! Good thinking . Behind you ! It 's gonna blow ! Sarge ! Sarge ! No ! Oh ! I got her ! Oh ! Oh ! - Are you OK ? - Yeah . Oh ! - Sorry . - You made it . Just in the nick of time , but I 'm learning . Yeah . So am I . Whoever has the pod has the power , right ? Assuming you can hold on to it . Congratulations . The team did it . Yeah . And I know just who the team is . I 'm looking at ' em . Come on . Hey , Hel , let me see the pod . No . Next week : 108 Choices

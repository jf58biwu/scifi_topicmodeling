 5x07 - Bot Seeks Bot [ Mexican accent ] The big top got a little smaller today , and the world got a little less funny . Boggles the Clue Clown has told his last joke . [ Robotic voice ] Sovereign has called an emergency meeting to appoint - Councilman 4 's replacement . - His name was Boggles , you chromium crossbreed ! - Stuff your meeting ! I 'm mourning here ! - My apologies , Red Mantle / dragoon hybrid . - I know you men were close . - They were close . I never much cared for the man . I found his jokes tedious , his riddles obvious ... Oh , the two of you ! Honestly , if you hate Boggles so much , why don 't you go over - there with those dicks ? - Can 't believe he 's really gone . - Right ? Who the hell are we gonna fight now ? - Language , chum . And stay alert . If I know the Clue Clown , he 's got one last trick - up his puffy sleeve . [ Camera shutter clicking ] - Ptchoo ! Gotcha ! Ptchoo ! Ptchoo ! Ptchoo ! Direct hit . Find your light , ladies . - Smile . You 're on covert camera . - All right , just take it easy on the equipment there . Brock : Anyone else find it a little convenient the one guy on - the council monstroso I.D. ' d suddenly dropped dead ? - There 's nothing convenient - about heart disease , I can assure you , Agent Samson . - Especially when your ticker taps out behind the wheel of your clown car . Heard it took 20 minutes to pull - his hench-clowns out before they could even get to him . - Brock : I just hope hunter 's hunch is right and some of his council cronies show up to pay their respects . It was Boggles ' last wish that I read this . [ Clears throat ] " To Captain Sunshine , my longtime nemesis . What kind of jack won 't help you fix a flat or score a royal flush or plug your phone in ? The answer may surprise you . " - [ Scoffs ] Shucks , that one 's easy . - Shh ! Flat , flush , phone ... Boggles , you fiend ! What does it mean ? ! [ Crowd gasps ] Too soon ! [ Spring squeaks ] - He always said he 'd have the last laugh . - He was always wrong . [ calliope plays Chopin 's " Funeral march " ] No ! No-o-o-o ! [ Crying ] No . Get off me ! - Hold up . I think we 've got an elemental . - Boom ! Yummy . - What 's he look like ? - She 's an earth mover , about 5 ' 7 " , two heads . - Great . Now hand 's all dirty , too . - Have you concluded your mourning , Red Mantle ? - You again ? - Because that meeting ... Good god , man . Have you no humanity left in you whatsoever ? This is why you have no friends , Vendata . [ Camera shutter clicks ] His name is Vendata . Guild cyborg , started henching in the late ' 70s , earned Level-1 status with a string of high-Profile super crimes in the ' 80s . - Largely inactive since ' 98 . - And a dead ringer for Councilman # 1 . All right . This is it , sports fans ... the brass ring . If we can get to this guy , we can get to the Guild . Brock : So , what else do we know about him ? Someone must have built him , right ? I 've tried searching earlier records , but all of that data is classified . - As you know , I don 't have clearance to ... - I sure as hell do . - Okay . So , um , should I not look , or ... - There it is . " Vendata ... formerly known as Venturion . Cyborg prototype built by - Venture Industries circa 1976 . " - He 's the Bicentennial Man ! - Brock : Whoa . Old Jonas must have pulled some strings to get that buried . - I 'm not listening . Hmm . " Project abandoned after subject exhibited erratic behavior , - attempted to strangle Rusty Venture . " - Brock : Been there . So , uh , how do we put - the screws to a rogue Robocop ? - Simple . - Check out this morning 's Guildslist . - " Bot seeks bot . Mature professional man of metal looking to make a meaningful connection " ? - Brock : A cyborg placed a personals ' ad . - Well , he 's still half a man , ain 't he ? - Now we know which half . - Everyone gets lonely ... sometimes . - They 're not as lucky as us . - " Might we make good alloys . " - What 's that , a typo ? Does he mean allies ? - Cyborgs don 't make typos . It 's a pun ... a God-awful one , but that 's our in . Classic honey trap . - Sir , I 'm willing to volunteer for this mission . - Mm , nope . - Sorry , goldie . You ain 't his type . - Well , I 'm not doing a robot . - Brock : Well , then , who is ? - Appreciate you coming in on such short notice . We wouldn 't have called if it wasn 't real important . [ Robotic voice ] I am glad to be of assistance . We are all on the same team , right ? And teamwork is what it 's all about , so it is with great pleasure that I officially introduce the new Councilman 4 to our little family . - Thanks , guys . Really looking forward ... - So , if there 's no other business , I hereby - adjourn this session of the council of 13 . - Wait , is that it ? First new member in , like , 15 years . Shouldn 't we celebrate or something ? Yes ! Take the new guy out ? Welcome him to the team ? [ All murmur agreement ] There will be no celebration ! Anonymity is essential to the business of this committee . Oh , please . Whom are we trying to kid ? We all know who we really are , and the new guy ... well , it 's clearly phage . Look at his head , for god 's sake . Councilman 3 and 8 , I am willing to overlook your - indiscretion at the Clue Clown 's funeral . - I didn 't want to go to that ! But I will tolerate no further violations of council code . Meeting adjourned . - You guys still here ? - Right . Where are we doing this ? Uh , why don 't y 'all just swing by my club tonight ? Drinks on the house . I can 't make it tonight , guys . I 'm sorry . - Tele-Screening in from Phoenix . The grandkids are here . - Oh , I have , uh , youth group tonight . - And , uh , uh , I 'm on the moon . - [ Robotic voice ] I cannot attend either . Oh , good-time Charlie can 't make it . - Big surprise . [ All chuckle ] - What , do you have a hot date ? - Ooh . - No . It is more just dinner with ... - with a friend . - Oh , since when do you have friends ? - Who is this " friend " ? A cuisinart ? - This jocularity is quite amusing , but I really must go . I am programmed for strict punctuality . So , how about the rest of you ? Should we carpool ? Yeah , we 're all so spread out . Let 's just meet at the club around 9 : 00 . - Done deal . It 's a party , then . So much for your precious anonymity . - Least I tried . - And you ... Moon . You 're coming out . Brock : Nice . The tech boys did a good job . You look just like him .

My name is Galacticon . Level-3 terror-bot , Guild member - five years . I work out of Tucson . - Brock : That 's my bot . - All right , he 's ready . - Where am I supposed to stick this ? - Not gonna go there . - There is no need . I have a wire built - into my head . - Brock : Okay . Better head in . - Something tells me this guy 's the punctual type . - Hey , so , where do you guys want me ... on that ridge over there ? Honey of a shot from over there . - Brock : No , headshot . Just ... hang tight for now . - Yeah , you just park that cute - little derriere of yours right here . - You know , enough , shore leave . We 're all just a little tired of the whole sassy , gay-guy - schtick , okay ? You know I 'm with Amber . - Mm , really ? - [ Chuckling ] Does Amber know that ? - What ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Brock : Hey , you know , yeah . That , uh , ridge up there does look pretty good . Yeah , you got a good shot from up there . - Er , uh , sweet ride , Steppenwolf . - Thanks . Built the old doom buggy here myself back in ' 66 . Ford Cobra engine , chrome-plated Stromberg carburetors , Bobby Barr racing headers ... she 's not street legal , of - course , but then , I am a supervillain . - Oh , but those were heady times . We 'd all get together on the weekends and race one another . I , in my Mantle-mobile , and Boggles in his clue car . Boggles ... Hey , who was that one fellow ... uh , what 's his name ? With the mustache ? - Oh , that narrows it down . - No , no . You know the one . He had a dog whom he taught to drive , and it would taunt and snicker at us . What ? ! Oh , you senile , old fool . You 're thinking of the " Wacky races . " Yes , yes . They could get quite wacky at times . Ooh ! We should get a dog . - So ... - So ... You look different from your photographs . - Are you disappointed ? - Ambivalent . Merely re-calibrating expectations . There . - I guess you do this a lot . - Actually , it is my first time . - Really , now . You don 't say . - Affirmative . I have difficulty connecting with people . Some of my co-workers - have been razzing me about it . - Tell me about your co-workers . - Brock : Nice , G.R. Real subtle . - Are you ready to order ? - Full disclosure ... I do not eat . - I do . However , I can only consume a specially formulated enzyme paste . - So ... - Yes . Let us go somewhere else . Brock : No , no . Don 't ! Abort . Abort . Can he even hear me ? - Where is your vehicle parked ? - I took the public transportation . Then we will take my vehicle . [ Car alarm chirps ] Brock : Where the hell is he taking him ? We 're in the middle of nowhere . Maybe he 's looking for a nice , quiet place to park and neck . - Brock : Or a nice , quiet place for a hit . - Not if I take him out first . Brock : No . Headshot , headshot , wait a sec . Snoop , throw the cloak up . - Dude ! - Oh , sorry . Sorry . I 'm on it . - Oh , where did all my Windows go ? - Brock : Come on , man . You 're gonna blow our cover . - Is something the matter ? - Negative . [ All sigh , mutter ] I thought I saw something , but I did not . Have you been here before ? - No .

Get it back . - Well , I can 't . They must have gone underground . Stupid machine ! Brock : So , you 're telling me we just sent our unarmed civilian informant into an underground nest of supervillains , and we 're deaf , dumb , and blind out here ? ! [ Electronic dance music plays ] And a lot of old villain crap here from my bodyguard days . - Should find something that will fit you . - So , what is this , like your fortress of Brockitude ? Secret Brock cave ? Shouldn 't you have blindfolded me before you let me in ? - Gassed me or something ? - Brock : Keep it up , and I might . - Here . - So , what , did you kill all these guys ? Brock : Most , yeah . Some of them just dropped their [ bleep ] and ran . - Who was this chief ? - Brock : I don 't know . I was too busy road-hauling him to catch his name . Unless it was " Wait , wait , please stop " - man . Snoop , we 're gonna need two Guild I.D. ' s . One for a , uh , Yeti Mummy , - and , uh , who do you want to be ? - Hmm . How about the Fruit Bat . - Brock : And one for the Fruit Bat . - Wait , wait . No , no , no . - I 'm Conquista-Dorable . - Brock : Oh , just hurry up and pick one . All right . Whoever 's in there , put your hands where I can see them . [ Gun cocks ] Ah , hey . It 's just you guys . - Uh , what are you up ... [ exclaims ] - Brock : Aw , dude . What ? He startled me . Besides , we 're on a secret mission here . You know he would have tried to crash the party . Dr. Venture : Party ? You guys having a party in here ? Hope I 'm invited , seeing as it 's - my house you 're breaking and entering . - Brock : Oh , hey , Doc , uh , no . No party . Just , uh , came to , uh , grab some of my old stuff . - So , we 're just leaving . - Dr. Venture : Great . Hatred 's off the wagon again . Nice work , Brock . Wh ... is that my Yeti-Mummy costume ? - You never returned it to the shop ? - Brock : Uh , yeah , no . That 's what I had to come back here for . Sorry about that . - I 'll take care of the late fee . - Dr. Venture : Come on , Brock . You never could lie to me . - Where 's the party ? - Brock : Doc , I really got to go . The costume shop closes in 10 minutes . I don 't want to get charged for another day ! [ Tires squeal ] All right . That 's a rum and coke , Tom Collins , old fashioned , absinthe and soda , kamikaze , single-malt scotch neat , and a light beer . - Enjoy , guys . - What were you thinking ? ! We 're mixing drinks . - Beer before liquor , never been sicker . - Then drink yours fast . - Never . - You made it . Welcome . Welcome . Look who else decided to show up . If it isn 't Councilman fun . Who the hell 's he with ? Is that G-g-g-g-galacticon ? [ Laughs ] I didn 't know Vendata was into rough trade . That Galacticon guy is in here - every week picking up a new John . - And here is another thing that has always vexed me about that show . Why do they call it " chips " as an acronym for California Highway Patrol ? It should logically be - pronounced " chipes , " with a long " i . " - My co-workers I told you about . - I should probably say " hello . " - Great . - I am eager to meet them . - No . No . I will only be a moment . I don 't see what the problem is . I 'm a fully licensed member of - this Guild in good standing . - Club 's full , Truman Ca-blow-me . 'Sup , guys . Can I see some I.D. ? All right . Enjoy yourselves , gentlemen . How come they get to go in ? - Brock : Geez , look at this Place . Tragic . - Ugh , right ? - Jungle is so ' 90s . - Brock : All right . I 'm gonna go look for ghost ... for , uh , Galacticon . You hang close to the door in case things get weird ... er . You got it , Chew-Brock-a . Ooh , somebody 's been working out . Oh , are you kidding ? I practically live at the gym . - Oh . [ Giggles ] I 'm called Vespertina . - Well , I call you adorable . Girlfriend , that costume is to die for . Barkeep , two appletinis , s 'il vous plait . [ Car horn honks ] Quizboy : All right . All right , already . - Dr. Venture : Where 's White ? Isn 't he coming ? - Quizboy : Who ? Steve Albino ? [ Chuckling ] No . He 's still mixing - the " jacket " single . - Dr. Venture : [ chuckles ] That thing . No wonder you were so eager to get out . Brock : Hey . - Greetings , Brock Samson . - Brock : Shh . Apologies . I regret to report my date is not going well . Conversation ... strained . - Rapport ... wanting . - Brock : Never mind about that . We 're aborting . - Where 's Vendata ? - He ditched me for his co-workers . - Brock : No . Don 't point . - Well , I just wanted to say " hello . " - I do not want to leave my friend waiting . - Don 't look now , Vendata , but your so-called " friend " looks like he found himself another " friend . " - That Yeti Mummy is oddly familiar . - 20 bucks says Galacticon gets him down to the bathroom in less than five minutes . Guy 's into bears . I 'm just saying I 'm exceptionally talented at two things in this world , Snoopy ... sniping and being extra handsome . And they 're both being squandered on this mission . [ Warbling ] Crap , oh , crap , oh , crap , oh , crap . Uh , moving target , 110 ... no , 120 yards , no wind ... I got this . Quizboy : I told you . Put your real damn glasses on already . Dr. Venture : Fine . Who puts a rock in the middle of a driveway , anyway ? Quizboy : Are you sure this is where Brock said the party is ? Dr. Venture : Well , he didn 't say exactly . - I , uh ... kind of followed him . - Quizboy : Wait a minute . - Are we even invited to this thing ? - Dr. Venture : Hey , if he 's gonna borrow my costume , I think - I 'm entitled to go to his costume party . - Quizboy : What party ? - Do you hear any music ? There isn 't even a door on this . - Dr. Venture : Well , here . Take a peek in that window . - Quizboy : There 's nothing . It 's a big elevator shaft . [ Gun cocks ] I think you guys must be lost . Quizboy : Um ... is this the costume party ? [ Laughs ] That 's pretty good . I didn 't even see your lips move or nothing . Dr. Venture : [ chuckles ] I don 't think you understand . We 're with Brock . - I 'm Dr. Ven ... - Quizboy : ... triloquist . Dr. Ventriloquist . Work with me . Yeah , but don 't let his title fool you . I 'm the smart one . Now , we got a show to do . You gonna let us in , or are you just gonna stand there letting the flies out ? [ Laughs mechanically ] - [ Spits ] Guess who just showed up ? - Brock : Oh , holy crap . - We got to go right now . - I 'll try to run interference . - Hey , watch it ! - Oh , no , please . After you . - Ack ! I hate this place . - I love this place ! Whoo ! Brock : Other way . Other way . I got an idea . And ... they 're off . Sorry , Vendata . I just call them like I see them . Sorry to bother you , boss , but , uh , Dr. Venture just walked in with a one-eyed midget , pretending to be a Ventriloquist act . Well , gentlemen , it 's been swell , but I must run . Boss is always on the clock , you know ? But , uh , make sure you stick around for the show . - Wow . He is fast . - Hello . Galacticon , are you in here ? Gasp . It is true . Ow . Brock : Shore leave , get ready . We 're going . You know , I 've been watching you all night . It 's a real nice outfit you 've got . Take it somewhere else , Captain Calamari . - I don 't dig on seafood . - I liked it even more when it belonged to - Sri Lankan devil bird . - Well , uh , maybe we have the same evil Tailor ... Sy 's , Route 19 ? A lot of us bird guys use him . Yeah , hi . - I 'm the red-throated loon . - Sri Lankan devil bird was a good friend of mine . They never found his body , and you ain 't him , so just who are you ? - Brock : There a problem here ? - Uh , no . No problem at all . - Sorry . - Brock : Beat it . Now , can we please get the [ Bleep ] out of here ? [ Record scratches ] Don 't leave now . Party 's just getting started . Let 's give a warm Don Hell 's welcome to the star of tonight 's entertainment ... the man you loved to hate since he was just a little boy . Dr. Thaddeus " Rusty " Venture ! [ Cheering ] Both : [ muffled screams ] - Brock : What the [ bleep ] - Yeah , yeah , that 's right . That 's right . Boy Venture himself and his little boy-man friend have agreed to play ... All : Wheel of torture ! No , we 're almost out of here . Don 't go fishing for trouble , - Brock Cousteau . He 's not our mission . - Brock : Just take ghost ... or Galact ... get him out of here ! I can do this on my own . What ? Commit suicide ? Blow your cover and start an inter-agency war ? I know he 's your old sugar daddy - but is he really worth it ? - What manner of torture awaits the feckless physicist and his funny little friend ? - The human piñata ? Five pains of Li Si ? - Ooh ! Ass to ass ! - Oh , dear . I 'm not with him . - Wrong night , dragoon . Hello . Hey , yeah , it 's flying squid . Yeah , long time , no ... listen . I 'm down at the club , and you will not believe what 's going on . You got to get down here now . - No , there 's no cover . - Your lovely hellstesses are coming around now . The lucky villain with the winning torture ticket gets to come on up and do - the deed him or herself . - Brock : You in position ? - Almost . - So , let 's get spinning . [ Cheering ] Brock : Hurry up , man . That thing 's not gonna spin all night . I need more time . I 've never taken this much girth . [ Cheering continues ] The winner is ... acid dip . [ Cheering ] - Ooh , I have ... - Winner ! And Vendata ... the big winner ... [ Chuckles ] finally got lucky today , but ... kidding , kidding . Come on up and do the honors . - What are you doing ? - Brock : I don 't know , man . - Just be ready for anything . - Dr. Venture : No ! The metal murder man - from my nightmares ! He was real . - Monarch : What the [ bleep ] is going on here ? ! That man you are illegally holding is my arch . Thanks for the tip , squid . Honey . [ Clears throat ] Guild of calamitous intent bylaws , article 97-D ... " no villain may arch previously claimed nemesis without first consulting the primary arch of said nemesis . " Except the articles of collusion , paragraph " C , " stipulates in the event of a team-up , the team 's right to arch supercedes that of the primary . - Just studied this for the council exams . - But ... not without offering the primary arch first right of refusal to participate in and / or lead said team-up . - She 's , uh ... she 's right . - All right . All right . Looks like the show is over . [ Grumbling ] Thank you for coming , and , uh , be sure to thank the Monarch for his untimely arrival . Be sure to tip your waitstaff on your way out . - Good night . - Monarch : Hey ! Yeah , keep walking , tin man . - Oh , is everybody leaving ? Is there an after party ? - Where is my wife ? - Have you ... honey . Does not compute . - Brock : Oh , hey . - Sorry , man . I haven 't seen her . - Does not com ... who am I ? - I think the plane is going down ... - Are we done here ? Please say you 're not gonna make - me save him from the Monarch now , are you ? - Brock : Oh , what 's he gonna do ? - He 's the Monarch . - Monarch : Well , well , well , Venture . Looks like I 've finally got you right where I ... [ crash ] [ Up-Tempo music plays ] And so , in acknowledgement of your expertise and extensive history of service to this Guild , I hereby invite you to join this esteemed council of 13 . Um ... could I have a day to think about it ? I should really probably talk this over with my husband . Phantom Limb : Ah ... best show on television . Who wants more popcorn ? What did I miss ?

 Where the Buggalo Roam [ DOORBELL RINGS ] MR. WONG : Yes ? - Hi , Dad ! It 's me and my coworkers . MRS. WONG : Open up , Leo . It 's Amy and her weirdoes . Howdy , friends ! Welcome to Mars ! Thanks for inviting us . I 've never been to a Mars Day barbecue . Mars Day better than Earth Day . Dump trash anywhere . - Big , empty planet . - Okay ! Make yourselves at home . Don 't mind if I already did . Do you have any more Dom Perignon bubble bath ? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway . [ GROWLING ] Quite a large ranch you have . 17.9 billion acres . We own entire Western Hemisphere . - That the best hemisphere . - It 's the same on Earth . [ CLACKING ] MR. WONG : Here is most number one product . The mighty Buggalo . Used for everything . Meat , milk . Their shells make rowboats . I broke your television ! It must take forever to brand them . Not really . We own so much , it easier to brand everything that not ours . Please don 't do that . Hey ! Betsy ! This is my sweet Betsy . I raised her from a larva that ate my sweater . We going to eat her at Amy 's wedding . If she ever get married . Dad ! Gleesh ! Don 't say that when you meet my boyfriend . Oh , that right . We get to spend time with this Mr. Kif . I hope he 's a nice man who can make grandchildren . This not a parallel universe where you get younger . Remember , the quickest way to a girl 's bed is through her parents . - Have sex with them , and you 're in . - I 'm nervous about meeting her family . That 's natural . You 're meek and uninteresting . You 've gotten by on my leftover charisma . Scrounging off it , like a tiny parasite . I hope they like me . Why wouldn 't they ? Yes , I know . Tiny , meek , uninteresting . Spare me your tedious story , Kif . And above all , have fun ! [ COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ] Get on down ! Oh , yeah ! Drop another barnyard bomb on us , Vanilla Corn ! Yo , fool ! It 's Mix-Master Festus . So , what 's Mars Day about ? It commemorate the day when our ancestor , Sir Reginald Wong bought Mars from stupid natives . How can you call them stupid ? They sell whole planet for one bead . Sound stupid to me . That is stupid ! I can 't believe you laugh at exploiting a proud , bead-loving people . Lighten up . It 's funny . Of course . But you don 't have to laugh ! No . Not on your parents ' planet . Glad to see you 've come back to the country . It 's where the flavor is . R.J. , this is my boyfriend , Kif . This wimp ? You 've gone a long way , baby . - Cigarette , partner ? - Oh , I don 't ... [ COUGHS ] - I haven 't even lit it yet . - Oh . Is it lit now ? Yep . You 're pathetic . Host man . Host woman . I 'm having a wonderful time ! You here five hours , already you tear up couch and fill pool with shrimp ! Not bad for a city boy , huh ? By the way , I took the liberty of fertilizing your caviar . [ BELCHES ] [ STAMMERS ] Relax . I 'm sure my parents will love you . When I get nervous , I can 't control my camouflage reflex . Oh , dear . Oh , goodness . Oh , odds and bodkins . - I 'll have a thorax and feelers . - You want salad ? Yuck ! Mom ? Dad ? You remember Kif . - I have instant dislike of him . - Too scrawny to father grandchildren . He 's not scrawny , he 's just small-boned . Actually , I don 't have bones . I 'm supported by fluid-filled bladders that ... You a big , squishy wuss . Amy should date real man . Like him ! I can be manly too . I think I 'll light up a smoke . Wrong way . Smooth . [ CHOKES ] Look on the bright side . My parents left after you passed out , so they didn 't see you barf . Now they 'll never think I 'm manly enough to date their daughter . It 's okay , Kif . I 'll go get you a tissue from your tote . Hey there , Amy . Like you to meet my buddy , Joe . Sorry I 'm late . My pool game ran long at the jazz club . Kids love him . [ HUMMING ] What 's that weird sound ? Dust storm ! Oh , dust storm ! Everybody into house . Hurry before we die . And wipe your damn feet ! Phew . Everyone okay ? No one considering lawsuit ? Mm . I might have mental anguish . - I 'm friends with every judge here . - I 'm okay , then . Storm dying down . Check if Buggalo herd is okay . Oh ! - Where are the Buggalo ? - Rustled under cover of storm ! - We ruined ! - No ! Don 't worry , Daddy . It 'll be okay . Oh , really ? Who gonna save us ? One-eye ? Lobster mooch ? Drunken garbage can ? - This sounds like a job for ... - Lt. Kif Kroker ! All right , then . Those Buggalo were what made Wong family so rich and powerful . Oh , Inez , we damn stolen ! We ruined ! Okay , I want a divorce . Mom ! Dad ! Don 't ask me to choose ! They 're not your parents . I 'm not your sister . And that 's not your golf cart . Aw . [ BEEPS ] Everybody calm down . Kif promised to catch the rustlers . Mrs. Wong , could I borrow a neckerchief ? [ BUZZES ] My plan is to take the remaining Buggalo and lead them on a tough cattle drive . When rustlers attack , I 'll make a citizen 's arrest . Sounds dangerous . Someone could get killed . Fry ? Leela ? Bender ? I want you to go with him . Oh , man . Don 't worry , Mr. And Mrs. Wong . I 'll get your cattle back , or die trying . We can 't lose ! No , it 's too risky ! You don 't have to do this to prove you 're a man . Oh , yes , he does ! Here are your mounts . She 's got a fine coat . We need Buggalo to lure the rustlers . How many are left ? Betsy 's the only one left . She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit . Kif : Ooh . Oh . Aw , she likes you . Saddle up , men ! We got some no-good rustlers to catch ! We got a right to pick a little fight With rustlers Somebody wants to pick a fight with us He better bite my ass Yee-ha ! Wow ! Look at that ! Olympus Mons ! The tallest volcano in the solar system . - Where ? - Right in front of you . FRY : Oh . Oh ! We 'll camp at the top . The rustlers will spot us . Where ? And even though the computer was off and unplugged an image stayed on the screen . It was the Windows logo ! - That 's not scary ! - It is if you 're a printer ! Okay , my turn to tell a ghost story . Once , there was this woman driving ... - Hook on the hand ! - Okay , I 've got one . This family ... Man in the attic ! Mr. Know-it-all-about-something , finally ! Tell a story . With pleasure . Once , not far from here , four people set out on a cattle drive . Bored robot kills Fry with a hammer ! Sorry , go on . While they sat helplessly around the campfire a demented , lunatic , libertarian zombie snuck up ... AMY : Surprise ! Amy , what are you doing here ? - I forgot to give you something . - Oh . What ? Is that your camouflage reflex , or are you just happy to see me ? I love it out here , Amy . I feel so manly . I have a blister , I spit , and , of course , I tell no one my feelings . - But you still have them ? - Yes . But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary . - Ah , it 's a wonderful night . - It sure is . I could lie beside you , staring at the sky , all night . - I can 't . - Ooh . [ RUMBLING ] - What 's that ? - Maybe we just made love . [ CLACKING ] AMY : The Buggalo are in the crater ! The rustlers must have seen me and ran ! - Oh , Kif . You 're so brave ! - Sh . They 'll hear us . Okay , the dynamite 's in place . There 's no other way to do it ? Only if your parents have thousands of helicopters . - Actually ... - Too late ! This is more fun ! Kif , you did it ! How did you know dynamite would work ? I took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune . The principle is essentially the same . [ HUMMING ] Hey , it 's that " barbecue 's over " sound again ! LEELA : Sandstorm ! [ SCREAMING ] - We 're in the eye of the storm ! - Where ? [ BUZZING ] What 's that ? - Oh , my gosh ! - Who are they ? We are the native Martians . [ GASPING ] I didn 't know Buggalo could fly . Those who revere Mother Mars can fly them . Only they shall have Buggalo . They 're us . But your Martian-ness , these Buggalo aren 't yours . They belong to the Wong family . You mean family that took all land and gave us a lousy bead ? Uh-huh . Amy Wong . And you are ? Mad at Wong family ! We plan to ruin them by stealing Buggalo . But now we take girl instead . Wait ! I 'm too rich to be kidnapped ! Amy ! No ! Don 't worry , Kif . I 'm sure some other beautiful rich girl will fall in love with you . Hooray ! You bring back cattle ! Yes . But I 'm afraid I 've got some bad news as well . Let Amy tell us . That way it soften the blow . Why Amy being so quiet ? Well ... That is ... [ HUMMING ] MR. WONG : Oh , no ! Martians kidnap Amy ! MR. WONG : It them . They no use good grammar . - I 'll get your daughter back . - Forget it , squishy . You lose her . You done enough . This time we get most decorated lawman in the whole universe ! You mean ... ? Oh , no , please , I beg you . For the ... I am the man with no name . Zapp Brannigan , at your service . Please , we need you go get our daughter back ! I 'll clean up Kif 's mess . I shall go bargain with the Martians personally . - Your gasps intrigue me . - Martians have no land . They been encouraged to live on reservation underground . No one ever dare go there . This mission is very dangerous ! Someone 's sure to be killed ! - Fry ? Leela ? Bender ? - Damn you , old man ! Aw , look . Betsy followed you , Kif . I didn 't realize you were bringing your girlfriend , lieutenant . She won 't leave me alone . Did I say girlfriend ? She sounds more like a wife . Zapp : Behold ! The stone face of Mars ! FRY : Hm . - The only entrance to the reservation . - What about the great stone ass ? But it 's on the other side of the planet . Noseward , ho ! [ MUMBLING ] [ DOOR OPENS ] I am Singing Wind . Chief of the Martian tribe . Take me to your leader . Moving along . Why you trespass on our land ? To negotiate Amy Wong 's release . And just to clarify , land is the stuff that has sky over it . - They have respect for the planet . - Cynthia used to drink Slurm . We 'll give girl when we get planet surface . - How do we know she 's alive ? - I 'm fine . Sh . Don 't weaken our bargaining power . What if you give her up and we carve presidents in your mountain ? You waste words . We want land that was taken from us . Actually , you traded it for a bead . Tribe suffer heap big buyer 's remorse . We want land ! My people are people of law . And that law is : No backsies . The time for stupid statements is over . [ HUMMING ] Oh , boy . Oh , oh , oh ! My eye ! Ma ! Pa ! Our precious ranch ! Oof . Aiee ! Ow . [ SCREAMS ] Amy ! No ! It 's too windy ! Kif : Stay calm , dearest ! I 'll save you ! - Kif ! You 're flying Betsy ! - Need a lift ? Oh ! Oh , oh . Great Mother Mars ! He has the gift . [ HUMMING STOPS ] FRY : Yeah , Kif ! BENDER : All right ! Kroker , that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism . We misjudged you , green one . You fly the Buggalo like us . You have reverence for Mother Mars . - Let there be peace between us . - Yes . Let us smoke-em peace pipe . Smoke-em ? Here , take . No thanks . I 'm on the peace patch . You must smoke peace pipe , peacefully . Or we 'll kill you . Well , it 's just really that I don 't feel ... Don 't be a chicken . Teenagers all smoke , and they seem pretty on the ball . - Yeah ! - Way to suck it ! Hey , I 'm smoking ! I 'm the greatest ! Oh , monkey trumpets ! You coughed at our offer of peace , so you must die . The bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones . I don 't have bones . I 'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that ... Ah ! Oh , oh , oh my . Oh . FRY : That 's the bead you traded your land for ? It 's a huge diamond ! It must be worth a fortune ! Really ? [ MUTTERS ] Oh , chief , you 've made me the happiest girl in the world ! If you want your land , we could trade back for it . Hm . We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership . - So we can have the diamond ? - No . We do have concept of ownership . You can go . Sorry about the rustling and kidnapping . - And your sacred land ? - Land , schmand ! We don 't want to live here . It 's a dump . We 'll buy new planet and act like it 's sacred . Who 's gonna argue ? Nobody , that 's who ! Kif flew Betsy , rescued me , and made peace with the Martians . He too much of a wimp . Yeah . I 'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here . Please , you give me too little credit . Captain Brannigan , you 're always welcome at Rancho Zoidberg . [ YELLS ] Money doesn 't make good people ! No , sir ! Thanks for saving my life , Kif . You 're my hero . Oh , you 're kind . But your parents still don 't like me . Well , gloviously . But if they liked you , then I wouldn 't . Don 't you know anything about girls ?

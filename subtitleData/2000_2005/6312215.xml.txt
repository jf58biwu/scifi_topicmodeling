IT 'S AN AFRICAN CULT THAT BELIEVES THE PLANES ARE GODS , SO THEY BUILT WOODEN PLANES TO LURE THE GODS OUT OF THE SKY , OR GET THEM TO GRANT FAVORS FOR THE TRIBES , SO THE CROPS GROW AND THE CHILDREN STAY HEALTHY . YEAH . OKAY , OKAY . AFRICA , AND IT 'S A CULT . WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH ME ? WELL , THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN BELIEVE THAT IF THEY CAN RECREATE A PIECE OF THE WORLD AS IT EXISTED BEFORE THE BIG DEATH , THAT THOSE DAYS WILL SOME DAY COME BACK . KEEPING THIS ILLUSION GOING , THEY THINK IT 'LL BRING GOOD FORTUNE FOR EVERYONE HERE . THEY BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE CREATE IN THIS HOUSE , THE LIFE WE HAD BEFORE THE DEATH , HAPPENS TO THE WHOLE TOWN .

THERE ARE WORSE THINGS . NAME THREE . LOOK AROUND YOU . YOU HAVE FOOD AND HEAT AND LIGHT AND TELEVISION . WE DON 'T HAVE TO FORAGE . YOU CAN 'T BE SERIOUS . YOU LIKE IT HERE ? THE WINDOWS ARE BARRED AND THE DOORS ARE LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE . WE 'RE UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE . THERE IS NO WAY OUT , JEREMIAH , SO AFTER A WHILE , YOU ... YOU JUST KIND OF GIVE UP . YOU LEARN TO ADAPT . I WON 'T . THEN THEY 'LL KILL YOU . I FELT THE SAME WAY WHEN THEY FOUND ME AND STUCK ME IN HERE . THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO . I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE FREE , TO WALK ON THE BEACH ... BUT AFTER A WHILE , I ADJUSTED , AND SO DID JIMMY WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM OVER HERE IN THE SUMMER , BUT THE OTH- - UNDERSTAND ? YOU ARE NOT MY FIRST " HUSBAND . " THE OTHERS , THEY FOUGHT , TOO , AND THEY PAID THE PRICE . I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF HERE , JEREMIAH ... BUT THERE 'S JUST NO WAY OUT . THERE 'S JUST NO WAY . SO , ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT , OR DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR DIVINE REVELATION ? IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE I MET JEREMIAH . I WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON , OKAY ? MY WORLD DIDN 'TLOOK THE SAME AS IT DOES NOW . THERE WERE TWO WAYS I MANAGED TO STAY ALIVE . FIRST , BY BEINGTOUGHER AND CRAZIER THAN ANYBODY I EVER RAN INTO . SECOND , I FOUND WHO THE POWER WAS IN TOWN , AND LINKED UP WITH THEM FOR AS LONG AS I STUCK AROUND , AND THERE WERE OTHER GANGSIN TOWN BESIDE THE DEAD . YOU KNOW , SOME HAD MORE GUNS , SOME HAD MORE GUYS , BUT WE HAD THE ONE THINGNONE OF ' EM HAD . WE HAD TONY . IT DIDN 'T MATTERIF HE HAD NOTHING AND YOU HAD A GUNPOINTED AT HIS HEAD , HE 'D STILL COME AFTER YOU . WE USED TO SAY THE NIGHTSBELONGED TO THE DEAD . DAYS , I TRIED TO BE A PERSON . THAT 'S HOW I MET IKEAND HIS BROTHER CAL . THEY WERE COOL . THEY WEREN 'T PART OF A GANG . THEY WERE JUSTTRYING TO GET BY . THEY SHARED THEIR FOOD , EVEN HAD SOME BOOKSTHEY GAVE ME , AND IN RETURN , I MADE SURETHEY STAYED OUT OF TROUBLE . I WAS TALKING TO BILL THE OTHER DAY , AND HE SAID THERE WERE SOME TOOLS IN A WAREHOUSE OVER ON SIXTH . COOL . MAYBE TONIGHT WE CAN SCOPE IT OUT , PICK UP SOME THINGS WE NEEDTO FIX THIS PLACE UP . NO , NOT TONIGHT . THE DEAD 'S WALKIN ' ON SIXTH . THEY GRAZING ? YEAH . GRAZING WAS WHAT WE CALLED ITWHEN WE HIT THE STREETS , GRABBED WHATEVER WE NEEDEDFROM ANYBODY WE MET . I DIDN 'T LIKE IT , BUT THERE WASN 'TMUCH OF A CHOICE , YOU KNOW ? MAYBE TOMORROW , THEN . YEAH , TOMORROW 'LL BE COOL . THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU ? YEAH , MAN . ALL RIGHT . BUT IT WAS A BAD WAY TO LIVE , BUT I USED TO SAY , " HEY , IT COULD BE WORSE , RIGHT ? " THEN ONE DAY , IT GOT WORSE . OKAY . HERE 'S THE DEAL . I 'M TIRED OF THIS PENNY-ANTE CRAP . WE NEED TO SHOW THESE SHEEPTHAT WE ARE A POWER , AND THAT WE 'RE RUNNING THE SHOW . THE OTHER GANGS , THEY CAN HAVE THEIR PIECE , BUT THE PIE IS OURS , AND HERE IS HOW WE 'RE GOING TO DO IT . WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT . WE 'RE GOING TO CUT THROUGH THIS WHOLE PART OF TOWN LIKE A HOT KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER . WE ARE GOING TO TAKE WHAT WE WANT . WE ARE GOING TO DOWHAT WE WANT , AND WE ARE GOING TO KILL EVERYBODY AND ANYBODY THAT WE SEE . WE 'RE GOING TO BLOOD THIS PLACE FROM END TO END , SO EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO RUNS THIS TOWN , AND BEST OF ALL , WE DO THIS ONCEAND WE DO IT RIGHT , WE 'LL NEVER HAVE TODO IT AGAIN . I SIGNED ON TO SURVIVE . I SIGNED ON , KNOWING I WAS GOING TO END UP DOING SOME THINGS I DIDN 'T LIKE , BUT I DID NOT SIGN ON TO GO AROUND KILLING PEOPLE IN COLD BLOOD . IF I 'D STAYED AND TRIED TO WARN IKE , OR CAL , OR ANYBODY ELSE , THEY WOULD 'VE FOUND THAT I WAS MISSING , AND I NEVER WOULD HAVEMADE IT OUT OF THERE ALIVE . THERE 'S NO WAY I COULD HAVE TAKEN ONTHAT WHOLE BUNCH AND LIVED , SO I DID THE ONLY THINGI COULD DO . YOU RAN . I RAN . AND BACK THEN , I DIDN 'T THINK ONE GUYCOULD MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE . I KNOW BETTER NOW , BUT AT THE TIME , MAN , I DID THE ONLY THING I COULD DO . I DIDN 'T WARN ANYBODY . I DIDN 'T TELL ANYBODY . I JUST ... RAN . AND WHATEVERWAS GOING TO HAPPEN HAPPENED . CAL ! CAL ! SO , YEAH , I KILLED HIM , JUST AS MUCHAS IF I 'D PULLED THE TRIGGER . HIM AND ANYBODY ELSE I COULD 'VE WARNED . DAMN RIGHT YOU DID . SO NOW THAT YOU GOT ME ALL TRUSSED UP ... YOU GOING TO FINISH ME OFF ? I 'M GOING TO FINISH WHAT I SHOULD 'VE FINISHED A LONG TIME AGO . IKE , I 'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS . I 'VE GOT RESOURCES NOW . NOW , I KNOW I CAN 'TBRING CAL BACK , BUT I CAN SET THINGS STRAIGHT . YEAH ? HOW ? YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE TOTRUST ME , OKAY ? NOW , SOMEBODY 'S GOT TO START TRUSTING SOMEBODYHERE , RIGHT ?

 If anyone finds this ... it means that my plan didn 't work ... and I 'm already dead . if I can somehow go back ... I might be able ... to save her . Evan ! We 're gonna be late again . Since when do you care about getting to school on time ? They 're putting up the pictures for Parents ' Night . Don 't worry . We have plenty of time . - Is dad gonna come ? - You know the answer to that . Can 't he just come out for one day ? We 've been over this a hundred times . It 's too dangerous for him . But Lenny said his dad 's coming . And Tommy and Kayleigh 's dad . I get the point . am I ? - No . Okay . Have a great day . I love you . I 'll pick you up later . I gotta go . Bye !

Don 't make me send you to Mr. Voytek . but I should talk to you first . - What is it ? - Yesterday I had all the children ... make drawings about what they wanted to be when they grew up . but this ... I don 't understand . Evan did this ? - Can I keep this drawing ? - Of course . Mrs. Treborn . I feel bad even mentioning . - What ? - When I asked about the drawing ... well ... he couldn 't remember doing it . I don 't wanna go ! Mom . It 's creepy . okay ? that 's all . You 'll like him . That 's good . You 're doing great . Just tell me he hasn 't inherited his father 's illness . Result will be negative . But there 's something else you can do to monitor his memory . - Anything . - A journal . - Have him write everything he does . - What will that do ? It could help to jog his memory . He can remember new things after . and we 'll take it from there . Okay . Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayleigh and Tommy . I 'll meet their father and see what a real dad is like . Great . See you soon . Evan ? Evan . What are you doing with that knife ? What happened ? Honey ... what were you doing with that knife ? I don 't remember . Andrea . - George . little man .

I was just somewhere else ! How did I get here ? Quit act like a retard or I 'll call your mom to tell a shit you 've been . Kayleigh . Kayleigh . What happened ? The good news is the results are negative . tumors . - It must have something we can go on . - Lf I was to guess the blackouts are stress related . - But he 's 7 years old . What kind of stress can he have ? Plenty . Maybe he has severe coping problems about not having a father . The last time the blackouts occurred was visiting his friend 's dad ? he has been pushing me to meet his father and I 've putting it off . Andrea . We can arrange a controlled meeting . some security . with a little luck ... no more missing father complex . 15th . Today I get to meet my father . His name is Jason ... and he 's crazy . I hope he lets me call him Dad . actually no . okay ? Okay . okay . I won 't bite . right ? Mom says I have your smile and your hair and your ... He has to die ! It 's the only way ! stop !

I want the truth . - I don 't know . I don 't remember . Something must 've happened ! Something set him off ! - I blacked out . - Don 't use the blackouts to get out . You 're not making it up ? Breathe in ... breathe out ... and relax . You are completely asleep and relaxed . I want you to take me to the time you were in the woods with Lenny . Think of it like a movie : rewind or slow down any details you wish . - Understand ? - Yes . Where are you now ? I 'm standing next to Kayleigh . My hands are over her ears . - Are you hurting her ? - No . I 'm protecting her . Okay . Now let 's move forward in time . What do you see ? I see a car . Evan . Tell me about the car . Go on . Nothing can hurt you . Remember ? It 's only a movie . You are completely safe . I can 't ... I 'm on the ground in the woods . Evan . The movie in your head is broken . tell me about the car . I can 't ! It 's coming ! Evan . Hurry ! It 's coming ! my God ! - On the count of 10 you 'll wake up . remembering everything . - What are you doing ? What is happening to him ?

Don 't ever bring this up again . Not ever ! Let 's go . Are you okay ? Holy shit ! Look that fat fuck ! He 's got bigger titties than Lenny 's mom ! faggot . No one is talking to you . Kayleigh . This was a bad idea . You really don 't remember anything that happened ? everything is gonna be okay . Lenny 'll be fine . You 'll see . - Sorry . - It 's not your fault . Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny . - Your dad did that ? - I deserve a lot worse . What are you talking about ? What you deserve is better father and brother . All they do is make you feel like shit ! do you ? - What the fuck are you doing ? - Buying popcorn . You ? - Whoops . - I don 't believe you did that ! - Why do you have to be such a dick ? - I don 't know . - You see how far he went . - I don 't believe . Stop it ! Stop hitting him ! What 's wrong with you ? kid . You 're outta here . Get him away ! Get him away ! The peaceful town of Briarville was rocked this afternoon ... in the wake of a horrible act of vandalism . While the police believe it was an act of criminal mischief gone awry ... the tragedy has clearly devastated the community . Now this was the grisly aftermath of as powerful explosion ... believed to have been caused by an unknown quantity of dynamite . no suspects and no motive for the ... Good night . We 're moving . I can 't believe Tommy 's still pissed at me . He knows I 'm moving away ? He 's been acting real strange lately . He won 't even look at me in the eyes . here they come ! Did your mom say if Lenny was okay ? right ? Welcome home . I thought you might like some fresh air for a change . - Is Tommy with you guys ? - No . It 's cool . what 'd you do in there ? It was awful . You can 't sleep ' cause everybody is screaming all night . I never want to go back . - Do you see that ? - Yeah . What 's up with the smoke ? Crockett ! What are you doing to my dog ? - Look what you make me do ! - What the hell 's wrong with you ? wake up ! Prince Charming ? How long I was out ? what 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . - Aced it . - And time ! Put your pencils down . And place your blue books on my desk before you leave . Mr. Nelson . We 're all in the same time zone here . Evan ? I don 't know . I might 've mixed up some of the stories . Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog to lick his nuts ? Typical psych major : A complete wise ass . How 's your project coming ? Still planning ... to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation ? I don 't really have a choice . jeez . It smells like patchouli and ass in here . Evan . Yeah . You 're the one that fucked up the bell curve on my anthropology final . - Bye . - Fucking dick . bro . You sick fuck . get dressed . You 're taking me out . - Why ? Aced another midterm ? - No . no blackouts . bro . Let 's do this ! Come on ! Be gentle to me ! I 'm post-coital ! Did she cradle the balls and lick the shaft ? Nice . Look at this fucking guy . Get the fuck out of my bar . Which one of you has the pet worm ? - Worms . Plural . - That 's so gross . Talk to him about it . He 's got the fetish . Watch it . It 's a psych project . It 's a study on memory loss . Better explain before all this excitement gives me a heart attack . - Ten bucks he eats it off the floor . - Well ... if I could figure out how the memories of a simple worm function ... it should help me to understand the complexities ... of the human brain . Let me get this shot . weirdo ? - The fuck is this ? I guess that 's your game . Smells like sex in here . Thumper had a busy afternoon . You 're kidding . He 's so big . I guess charisma and eyeliner go a long way . - You want a beer ? - Yeah . You got any incense or scented candles or something ? No . These are my ... Most guys tuck porn under their bed . All you 've got are comp books ? They 're my journals . I 've been keeping them since I was 7 . Wow . Read me something . I ought to be getting something out of this . That 's all I got to say . It 's like my mind refuses to believe what I 'm seeing . Hearing Crockett make those awful screams . Just writing about it gives me the shivers . Come on . Go on . It was like Tommy was possessed or something . There was a hate in his eyes that ... Are you okay ? Where am I ? What the hell is going on ? - I can 't get it open ! - Drop it ... or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep . Lenny ! Save Crockett ! Evan . Listen to me good . There 's a million other sisters . Why 'd you have to fuck with mine ? It 's okay . It was just a dream . - Didn 't feel like a dream . - Maybe because they never do . you pass out on all your dates ? Lenny ? I 've got a surprise for you . You 'll never gonna guess who 's here . It 's me . Evan . What are you working on there ? A model ? so I 'll try to make this quick . You remember that day at the junkyard when we were kids ? I was just hoping you could help me remember ... or ... - I couldn 't cut the rope . - Yeah . That 's good . Anything else ? Drop it or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep ! Jesus Christ . It really happened . I ... motherfucker ! What I remember before the blackout was hold my hands over her ears . I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than on the mailbox across the street . Lenny . motherfucker . How 's my sweet girl ? don 't you honey ? You want to open it ? You open ? - My God ! - Holy shit ! Run ! Lenny ! Come on ! Lenny ! Let 's go ! fucking brutal . - Hello . - Hello ? Who is this ? it 's Evan Treborn . I hope you know how much you upset Lenny . Yeah . I 'm really sorry about that . It took me over an hour to clean up the mess you made . - Can I just talk to Lenny ? - Don 't call here . Mom ! I can 't help it . I 'm so proud of you . Did Da ... Did Jason get good grades ? He got " A " s without touching a book . This area of his memory never failed . figured out a way to recall his lost memories ... years after he blacked them out in the first place ? - Why do you ask ? - I just figured he was a brain ... you 'd think that he 'd figure out a way to remember stuff that he forgot . almost exactly your age come to think of it ... he said he figured out a way to remember his past . I couldn 't tell if they were real memories or just his imagination . just before it got so bad ... he said he could ... What ? - What did he do ? - Forget it . It 's nothing . He was far too sick by then . I never wanted to be in the movie anyway . so I wanted to wear my clothes . - Mr. Miller took my shirt off . " - What the fuck are you doing ? man ? Maybe there is a reason you repressed some pervert in your tighty whities . I 'd think twice . You could wake up more fucked up than now . More fucked up than I am . You think you know me ? I don 't know me . it 's my fault . I 'm fine . Can we get through one damn day without you breaking something ? Evan ? it 's been a long time . How 've you been ? I don 't know . Fill me in . I 'm going to State now . It 's going good . My mom 's good . - Want a smoke ? - No . Not since we were kids . a hundred times . or ... ? - Can I walk you ? - Sure . - My God . - So ... how 's Tommy ? They kept him in juvy for while . Now he 's working over at Dale 's Auto Body . That 's good . - Still living with your dad ? - No . I emancipated myself at 15 . - Must 've taken a lot of courage . - Not if you remember my dad . Couldn 't you have moved in with your with your mom ? she had a new family . Wasn 't enough room . Whatever . the reason I came back to town was to talk to you . To me ? Why ? Well ... remember when we were kids and I used to have those blackouts ? of course . some of those memories have been coming back to me . And I wanted to talk to you about one of them in particular . I 'll try to remember . your dad was making a movie ... Evan ? Did he ... ? it was a long time ago . - I know . - Is that why you came all the way ? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood ? No . I just think that something really bad might 've happened . Is there a point to any of this ? it wasn 't our fault . We were kids . There was nothing that we could do to deserve ... Evan ! You 're wasting your breath . You can 't hate yourself because your dad 's a twisted freak . Evan ? You come all the way to stir up my shit because you have a bad memory ? Should I cry on your shoulder and tell you everything 's all better now ? okay ? Nothing ever gets better . why didn 't you call me ? Why did you leave me here to rot ? almost exactly your age come to think of it ... he said he figured out a way to remember his past . - Some dude left a message for you . - You can smell from the bathroom . This is Professor Carter . Why you didn 't hand in your essay today ? I was a bit concerned . Call me to schedule a makeup . motherfucker ? Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me . She said you came and saw her last night . She ... she fucking killed herself tonight . She 's dead . And so are you . If the scar on my stomach didn 't just come out of nowhere ... maybe my father wasn 't as crazy as everyone thought . do I have the power to heal them ? What about Kayleigh 's scars ? I never wanted to be in the movie anyway . It was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes ... but Mr. Miller ... took my shirt off . Let 's go down to the basement . It 'll look more like a dungeon down there . A little light here . - What I say about keeping that shut ? - But I want to see ! You 'll see the back of my fist in two seconds if you don 't do what I tell . in this part of the story ... Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian ... and they have to kiss and stuff like the grownups do . Kayleigh . Come on . Just like when we take a bath . Evan . we 're making a movie here . Put your hands on your ears . What time is it ? It 's time for you to do what I tell you to do . fuckbag . This is the very moment of your reckoning . you 're going to open up one of two doors . The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood . What ? What 's happening ? How are you doing this ? It 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child ... into an empty shell whose only concept of trust ... was betrayed by her sick pedophile father . it 'll lead to her suicide . daddy . - Who are you ? George . Your other option is to treat Kayleigh like ... Papa ? fuckbag . You screw this up again ... I swear I 'll castrate you . Tommy ... because the kid is one sadistic pup . One last thing . Don 't ever touch me again ! I won 't . Faster ! Crockett ! I can 't believe you came ! I think you got one . Check out our new house . are you all right ? you 're bleeding ! - Kayleigh . It 's you . Incredible . thanks . Go get cleaned up and come back to bed . silly . The bathroom 's ... ? Hurry up . I want a quickie before school . What ? Un-fucking-believable . I wish I could get as excited over a nose bleed . I didn 't see you . You 're the girl that was with those assholes throwing popcorn at Thumper . What ? And your name is Gwen . I know you . lay off the blow . Don 't freak out when I ask you this ... but do you remember when your dad got that video camera ? man ? I think he had it the first day and then he gave it away or something . Why would that freak me out ? I don 't know . - Just being weird . - You are such a goofus . - So I 'll see you tonight . - Okay . mom . - Andrea ... - Evan ... - And Chuck aren 't home right now ! You know what to do . Chuck . I 'm just calling to say hi . Just give me a call back . man ? frat boy ! there 's only two more weeks ... until your psych projects are due . About that essay I missed last week . We 're still okay with the extension ? - And you are ... ? - Evan . Treborn . Mr. Treborn . Please sit down . The exam is about to begin . everyone . The exam will begin in one minute . asshole . You guys started that shit . you 're hysterical . Did you study for this ? huh ? - Me neither . Evan keep it on the DL . I want to do something special for Kayleigh tomorrow night ... so if I said that I needed some help from you and the brothers ... Blow me . " Get the pledges to do it . - Right . The pledges ? - Yeah . You may begin now ! That was so good . my God . Where 'd you learn those new tricks ? was it ? if you call multiple orgasms weird ... Fuck them . What do you think it is about us ... that makes us so perfect ? I mean ... why did you sneak out to visit me after I moved away ? Because I missed you . You think my dad could 've stopped me from seeing you ? What 's he gonna do ? my toes are numb . Do you think that we 'll be together forever ? isn 't it ? - Hell or high water ? - Yeah . That 's ... I was just making sure . Yeah . That 's the plan . All right . you know what you have to do for me . sir . sir . Are you kidding me ? What ? What 'd you say to me ? give me the Greek alphabet .

What ? bitch . - Where are you taking me ? - I 'm not telling . Oh my God ! Wow . It 's beautiful . Go on . Sit down . Thank you . Why are you doing this for me ? When I woke up this morning ... I saw your smile . That smile . And I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you . I 've been looking all over for you . Someone trashed your car . What the ... ? Who did this ? Who did it ? It was probably those Beta fuckers ! How did somebody get away with this right in front of the frat house ? a dog collar ? - Tommy . Don 't . He might be watching . It 's my fault . I should 've told you that he was released few weeks ago . Might 've been nice . Like this will do any good . Maybe one of the frat guys got a gun . okay ? He 's just trying to scare you away from me . it 's not his fault . You know how bad he had it when we were kids . no . Don 't give me this bad upbringing shit . - You turned out just fine . - My father never laid a hand on me ! It 's like that prick saved it all for Tommy ! All right . We 'll let campus security deal with it . I think I should sleep alone . No . You 're not staying alone . I 'm staying with you . I just don 't want Tommy to see us together right now . No .

Look man ... when they come ... you go someplace else in your head . Be somewhere else . - Back your ass off ! - Move your ass . yo ! Give me that . I spoke to your lawyer ... and he says he 's sure he can get you off on self-defense . - So if you 're just patient ... - Mom how long am I gonna be in here ? - I don 't know . These things take time . What about the journals ? Did you bring the ones that I asked to ? I found these two . - The others are still in storage . - Mom ! I need them all .

Jesus speaks to me in my dreams . yeah ? That 's cool . Great . Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you . I need you to watch my hands and face closely . - You need to see the prison shrink . - Tell me if you see anything weird . anything . " On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing I didn 't do . Mommy won 't let me see it . " Evan . Sit down and finish your drawing . That 's great . Just imagine what you want to be . There 's no limits . Mrs. Boswell ? man ! - What 'd you see ? What 'd it look like ? - Signs of Lord come out of nowhere ! I thought you were fucking crazy . man . Want to make a deal ? but I think I get how things work . You either join a gang or you 're dead . I sure as fuck ain 't joining up with no spics or niggers . And I don 't want to die . So ... what do I got to do ? I 'm the new guy . I got to work my way up so ... should I suck your dick now ... or ... ? Is your blood pure ? I ain 't no fucking kike if that 's what you 're asking me . honey . sir . Come to Daddy . Carlos ! We took the woods so we wouldn 't bump into Tommy . No smoke yet . Hold them ! Hold them ! We took the woods so we wouldn 't bump into Tommy . No smoke yet . Rot in hell you fucking animals ! before we ... we need something to cut open the sack . Lenny . Today 's your day of atonement . I know guilty you feel about that woman and her baby . stop it . It 's not the time . - Now 's the only time ! to start over clean slate ! you 're acting crazy . trust me on this one ! Cut the rope . Come on ! Evan . - I 'll do what you want . fine . Just let Crockett go . they 'll stick you in juvy for sure ! And I know you 'd never leave your sister alone with your father . no ! Lenny . I said cut the rope ! It 's all backwards . Evan ? Who did this ? weirdo ? no ! Wanna a ride ? Lenny . Somebody call 911 ! Evan ! doc . What 's the damage ? How much time do I got ? Evan . It 's a little complicated . I haven 't seen results like these before . Not even with my father ? actually they didn 't have these tests 20 years ago . what did you find ? - Most of the hemorrhaging is coming ... from the outer layer of the cerebral cortex . Evan . I 've never seen anything like it . We compared these to last year 's ones ... we found severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction . - What does that mean for Evan ? - He 's saying ... I 've jammed 40 years worth of memories into my head in a year . doc ? Yeah . I 'm going to wait in the car . Light in here is kind of bugging my eyes . doc . It was very informative . things to read ... Evan . Can I get you anything ? huh ? I bet I can get a shitload of model airplanes up in here . Lenny ! didn 't you ? When you put that shard in my hand ... you knew something big was gonna happen . Didn 't you ? Yeah . - I knew . - Then you should be where I am . You should be where I am . Today I get to meet my father . His name is Jason ... and he 's crazy . I hope he lets me call him Dad . You ok ? Because you looked like you went somewhere else for a second . I need some fast answers from you if I 'm ever going to fix what I 've done . I prayed this curse would end with me . It didn 't . So now I need information to make things right again you 're the one that can give it . - There is no " right " ! You can 't change who people are without destroying who they were . Who says you can 't make things better ? son ! It must end with me . Just by being here you may be killing your mother . Bullshit . I 'll send you a postcard when I made all perfect again . no ! did you ? Nothing . My brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that . I meant no offense . None taken . Is Kayleigh Miller still working here ? I never heard of her . God ! Can 't a man get a little goddamned peace in his own house ? fuckbag . Remember me ? We had a nice chat once when I was 7 . I got one question for you . Where can I find your daughter ? I thought you were someone else . I 'm expecting someone . It 's good to see you . Can I come in ? If I knew you were coming I would have cleaned the sheets . What do you want ? Evan . Money . right ? So how 's tricks ? Sorry . Occupational humor . I got it . You can stop know . precious ? No . Just that you felt like you had to use it to hurt me . I 've been where you 've been . - Where is that ? - You wouldn 't believe if I told you . in this case it 's not even worth trying . I knew I needed to find you . So I went over to your dad 's and made him tell me where you were . the rest you know . - You 're right . I don 't believe you . I never thought you would . That 's why I never told a soul until now and I never will again . I 'm the only person you 've told ? That 's a great line . Does that make other girls wet ? Do they actually eat up that bullshit ? I could give a shit whether you believe me or not . I 'm too tired to prove it to you . huh ? How else would I know that you have twin moles on your inner thigh ? Anyone with $ 50 bucks could tell you that . Okay . Forget that . How about the fact that you prefer the smell of skunk to flowers ? Or that you hate cilantro ? it reminds you of your stepsister . Or that when you have an orgasm your toes go numb ? I 'm sure all your clientele know that . I just thought you should know . Know what ? That you were happy once . With me . there 's one major hole in your story . There 's no way on this planet I 'd ever be in a fucking sorority ! - You were happy then . - You crying ? - Sure you don 't want your wallet ? - I don 't need it where I 'm going . Are you off to change everyone else 's life again ? Maybe next you 'll pop up in a mansion ... while I end up in Tijuana doing a donkey act . You know what ? I 'm over it . everything just goes to shit . slick . You 've already done so much for me ! Why don 't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby ? And then maybe Lenny wouldn 't freak out and ruin my family ! No ! Go back to when I was 7 ... and fuck me in front of my daddy 's video camera . Straighten me out a bit . You 're on my bed ! Get out ! with you being sick and all ! I am not gonna say it again . " What I remember before the blackout was my hands over Kayleigh 's ears . I think I was more focused on her hands on mine ... than on the mailbox across the street . " Stay back ! Don 't go near the mailbox ! - Idiot ! - Get the hell back ! lady ! Goddamn it ! I thought I told you two to get out ? did we wake you ? No . It 's cool . It 's really cool . What the fuck is this ? - Please save his arm . - Can you open up my locker ? - Happy Birthday ! - You wanna go now ? - Can I come too ? - Want me to move your popcorn ? Evan ? Get a towel ! Get a towel ! Evan ! Evan ! - Where you going ? - You ever notice Kayleigh 's smile ? - Lenny is the best . - You guys make a great couple . You ever think that I 'll find someone ? Evan ! - Where are we going ? - We 're taking you to the hospital . your mom would kill me ! Lenny ! You owe me that much . What are you geeks looking at ? Must be nice to be so goddamn perfect ? help me ! God . Here . Get him over . how 's your head feeling ? I saw that girl you went home with . - She borrow your razor this morning ? - So bad ! Tommy ! Tommy ! man . I did what you said . We 're pooling our funds with the Hillel House ... Maybe I can spin my chair to a " Hava Nagila " techno remix till I puke . - Maybe we should get to class . - What 's the point of psych class now ? Tomorrow I could wake up a dirt farmer in Bangladesh . Let 's go for a stroll . sis . What 's up with him ? huh ? You know how spiritual he 's gotten since saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie .

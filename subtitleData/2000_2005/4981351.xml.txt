 Work frell you , work ! See , to me it 's unbelievable . You know- - I can come to the Mall of the Uncharted Territories , buy anthing I want cause I 'm rich- - and that leather SM faced wacko Scorpy clone- - he 's-he 's , locked in here ... here so , you know , I- - - -anything with all , you know , everything , is going to be just fine , but no- - my friend , she 's sick , so we gotta find a place where she can heal- - and you have no idea what I 'm talkin ' about , do ya ? No . What the hell 's goin ' on out there ? Gamma disturbances are quite common in this area . Are you talkin ' , like , storms ? Oh , yes . They 're no problem . John ! Hey yo , ' Heavy D ' ! Hey man , have you tried one of these things ? They 're terrible , but once you get past the blue slime ... underneath ... pure aviation fuel ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Look what I got me and Chiana . They 're ' Union Tattoos ' . They 're burned into our skin ! Cool . You know , I ... I never though I was going to get married again , but then ... - What ? - What ? - Have you been talking to Chiana ? - No , no . I know she 's angry with me ... but when she gets these ... Yeah , D 'Argo , look ... I could be wrong , all right ? Um ... probably am ... She probably wouldn 't , but ... Chiana could ... say no . How could she say no ? No ! No more . This is crazy . - Yeah - ... and creepy . Why are we in here with these bodies ? Because it 's cold . Your Dad ... D 'Argo ... D 'Argo hates the cold , so he won 't catch us if he comes back early . I 'm half Luxan ... I 'm not crazy about the cold either . I 'll warm you . 'Your Eminence ' just gave them a three hundred finek tip ! That 's more than a year 's wage ! The server class is never rewarded enough . Here ... let me help you . I 'm dying Stark , I 'm not an invalid . Don 't talk like that . I 've got maps here , maps ! We 'll find a planet where you can recuperate . Just buy me an intoxicant . That 's all I need to recuperate . She looks weaker . Yes , she does . So , what did you buy ? Just some essentials . Wha 'd that be ? Floss ? Lip-liner ? Weapons . I traded a pulse pistol for some original Tarnek Deployers . Cool . Are you Crichton ? Who are you ? Security . And are you Crichton ? No he 's not . And we don 't know who this " Cretin " is . You know , I heard he destroyed a Peacekeeper Gammak Base ... murdered an entire Nebari battalion , even laid waste to a Shadow Depository- - I heard he was a devil . He raped and pillaged - he popped eyeballs . - Whoa , whoa ... where ... where do they get these stories ? Let 's set the facts straight . First off ... there was no raping , very little pillaging , and ... Frau Bleucher popped all the eyeballs . I knew you were Crichton . Look ... I 'm not here for any trouble . I 'm just lookin ' for some aviation fuel shooters . That 's great . That 's great because , in here , everything 's on me . We hate Peacekeepers . Hey Moordil , Moordil ! Intoxicants for Crichton and his ... his grunt . I 'm not his grunt . Yeah , so ... you here to kill somebody ? Can I help you ? No , no , no . My ' grunt ' does all my killing . I 'm strictly R R. What the hell 's goin ' on around here ? Moordil , what 's the problem ? Watch out ! Look out Zhaan ! My name is John Crichton ... * I am lost * an astronaut ... * shot through one wormhole * In some distant part of the universe ... * I 'm trying to stay alive * Aboard this ship * this living ship * of escaped prisoners * my friends * If you can hear me * beware ... * if I make it back ... * will they follow ? * If I open the door ... * are you ready ? * Earth is unprepared * helpless * for the nightmares * I 've seen * Or should I stay ? * Protect my home ? * Not show them ... * you exist * But then you 'll never know ... * the wonders I 've seen * Aeryn . Where 's Aeryn ? Aeryn ? ! Here . Under a pile of dren ! Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Nothing like a bomb to sober you up . - Stark - I 'm fine . Anybody hurt ? - I 'm bleeding ! Help me ! I 'm bleeding ... - I 'm here ! I 'm here , I 'm coming ... Hey ! What happened here ? Was it a bomb ? The storm ! I thought you said the storms were no problem ? Pilot . How 's Moya ? We 've been thrown into the docking ring . Moya 's elastic skin saved us ... but three hatches have ruptured ! Chiana ! Can you hear me ? ! I , uh ... I got you Pilot . There 's a hatch breach on Tier 7 ! I 'm onto it . Is Jothee all right ? Oh , yeah . He 's fine . I better get out to Moya and see if there are any survivors . Check on her exterior ! - Chiana ... this guy ... this guy 's moving ! - What ? ! What 'd you do to him ? I didn 't do anything . The thing busted open and he started moving . - Well then , close it up ! Just ... - I don 't think you can just " close it up " ! What the hell 's he waking ' up for ? I thought he was dead . No , no , no . They were- - they were quick frozen or something before they died . - Stay with him . - I don 't want to stay here . No . Just make sure he 's okay . All right ? Crichton wants to talk to him . He thinks he 's- - he thinks he 's , uh ... some kind of relative . Chiana ! What if he heard us when we were ... were ... Jothee ! I 've gotta stablize the frelling hatch ! Whoa ! Watch it . Watch where your goin ! Watch yourself , slut . What did you say ? Out of my way . Zhaan needs these medical supplies on the station . What 's the matter with you Ryge ? I heard you . - You heard nothing . - Freezer chamber ... young half-breed.Any of this getting you wet ? If you tell D 'Argo , I will rip out your tongue and shove it up your faddic ! You idiot ! I won 't have to tell him . He 's Luxan . He 'll smell Jothee all over you ! Keep your lips shut ! You do the same with your legs ! I 'm in the transport pod , Pilot . Three of the stations five pods have been destroyed . I can 't find any signs of survivors . How 's Moya ? Well , her epidermis seems intact , but she 's tangled up in some of the stations cables . I 'll see if I can reverse us clear . Pilot . Wait . There 's another ship close-by . It seems intact . Try to bring it in using the docking web . I 'll try , D 'Argo . Don 't move , Moordil.The beam has pierced your monin artery . What does it matter ? The station 's destroyed . There must be hundreds dead- - hundreds . Shhh ... stay calm , Moordil . There 's nothing we can do about those souls , anyway . Everything 's gone . Then those stories must be true . - What are you talking about ? - You see ... there were once three Commerce Stations near the twin suns of Qell . But one has been destroyed by asteriods , one has been burned by fire , and we are the last remaining station . There were stories that we were cursed . Why would you be cursed ? Because this station is built on what we call " The Sacred Stillness " . This is where some say the great gods were born . That 's just dren ! There 's no curse . It was- - it was just storms . No , they weakened before they reached us . But you know , this last cycle , it 's been gaining in strength . The storms have been compacting to funnels just six parisms wide- - each storm getting closer . It 's as if they were aimed at us . Can 't aim a storm . Then the curse must be true . This is Gezma 's revenge ... for buying and selling in his Sacred Stillness . Where am I ? On a Leviathan . We found you in a medical lab . You don 't remember how you got there ? No . I just ... I was on an expedition . We were looking for the Dimordis Tomb in the Berger Nebula . I got sick ... Stanis and me got sick . Jool found us . When you were in there ... before you woke up ... you hear anything ? I sensed ... some movement ... kind of a thumping sound . It didn 't ... last ... long ... Are you okay ? Now , I 'm supposed to look after you , so don 't do anything crazy ! Oh , frell ! Chiana , get down here ! I think this guy 's dying ! Get down here ! Handle it yourself ! See if you can force it , Chiana ! Pilot ... I 've sealed the vent ! Pilot ... we 've got another problem . The child , ah ... the child your friend saw must be trapped in the lower pod . There is ... There is ... there was ... a nursery there , for when the parents were shopping . - How do I get down there ? - You can 't . All the connecting walkways are crushed . No , no , no , no . There 's always another way in . If those filtration vents have integrity , they link to waste conduits in the lower pod . Over here ? Yes , that 's it . All right , I 'll check them out . All right . I 'm coming with you . - What did you do to him ? ! - Nothing . He puked on me , then he died . - You killed him , didn 't you . - What ? ! What , did he see us ? Is that why you killed him ? No he didn 't see us . I didn 't ki ... even if he did I wouldn 't kill him ! He just died . Chiana ... Yes , D 'Argo . You and Jothee get down to the transport hanger and make sure that ship we 're bringing on board isn 't hostile . We 're on our way . Go bathe . What ? ! We 're in the middle of this massive khamshin and you want me to wash ? ! What do you smell , Jothee ? Right now . You smell me ... don 't you ? And you 're only half-Luxan . D 'Argo will smell me all over you unless you go bathe before he gets back on board . Go . Go now . All right , Moordil . Short incline , and then it splits off . If it 's still intact , the lower vent should lead to the nursery . Got it . After me . After you . You know ... I 've been thinking ... about us . You want to talk about this now ? It 's a good time ... no one here to bother us . I know the pressures of living close . How it can affect the safety of an entire battalion unless tensions are relieved . So , what do you suggest ? Well , in Peacekeepers , it was common practice to , ah ... reduce fluid levels . Fluid levels . Like ... what , like Valvoline , like brake fluid ? Like sex ... We can have sex , if you want to . You know what ... uh ... now is not a good time . How about I , uh ... check my diary and get back to you later in the week . It would ... relieve the tension . Is this for you , or for me ? For both of us . You know what ? I got ... two hands ... I can alternate , I can release all the tension I want . I don 't need your charity . And I don 't need your emotions . But we can have sex if you want . Watch that , that 's broken . Yeah , but don 't change the subject . What are you afraid of , John ? Aeryn ! John ! You okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Something smells completely frellnik down here , so I suspect I found the waste conduit Moordil said we had to find . Look , just stay where you are . I 'll go get some help and we 'll get you out . No , I 'm going to follow this down . See if it leads to the lower pod . No . Stay where you are ! Tell Moordil I 'll comm him when I need directions . - Damn it ! You stubborn wench ! Ju ... - Crichton . Pilot- - I 'll call you back ! I can 't talk right now ! You have to talk . I 've run the residual storm graph you wanted . You were right . The storm took a 90 degree turn to hit us . 90 degrees ? It seems to have come after us , on purpose . And there 's worse ... Pilot says there 's another storm on the way . It 's gonna hit us in less than two arns and it 's bigger than the last one . Hit us ? This station can 't take another hit . Yeah , I know that ... Then let 's all get onto Moya and haul out of here . I can 't pull the spike out of Moordil , and I can 't just leave him here . - Well , he 's gonna die isn 't he ? - Well , yes , but ... - Blue ... - What does it matter if we leave him ? Blue ... Sparky ... Just knock it off . We 've got at least two arns , Aeryn can use that time to try and free the trapped girl . I don 't give a siezil 's ass about a trapped girl . Yes , and that 's what makes you a great humanitarian , Buckwheat . But we are not leaving . It 's ' Scooby-Doo ' time . All right , here 's the deal : Our Pilot says that the storms are being attracted ... by a flux broadcast being generated somewhere inside this station . - The station ? - In here ? - Yes . Someone 's targeting the storm at us ? - Yes . - You see ! I told you the storms weren 't Gezma 's wrath . No . You just managed to piss somebody off . Now , do you have any idea who would want to destroy your station ? Tell him . Frell ! Go on ... tell him . Probably going to die anyway . There 's a cult of religious zealots ... the Kampeks . Some call them noble warriors . But they 're not . They 're insane . And you can 't bribe them . I tried when I thought they were responsible for the destruction of the other stations . Kampeks ? This is their Sacred Stillness ? You see , they say we 're desecrating their gods by buying and selling here . They must be broadcasting the storm signals . Then let 's destroy it . Let 's find out where the signals are coming from and smash it . How ? There are twelve levels on this station , you 'll never search it in two arns . We might . I got an idea . Pilot says it 's empty but he can 't sense how to get inside . Defense shield is active all the way around the ship . Gimme a shot , I 'll get inside . What 's that smell ? I bathed.I did . Twice . Are ... you wearing ... perfumed wash ? Yeah . I gave him some from Zhaan 's chamber . Yeah , well , ah ... you smell very nice . - Give me a break . - No , no .. - really you do ! You smell just ... - Find your own way into the frelling ship . Jothee ! I was only teasing ! Jothee ! You look attractive . Do I ? Yes . Like you 're happy . I 'm not . I know I 've been a trasnik , and I want to apologize . Look , don 't worry about it , okay ? Really . I am so sorry . And there 's , uh ... something I 'd like to talk to you about if ... Uh ... look , D 'Argo , I 'm not ... I 'm not ready to talk now , okay ? - What do you want me to do , beg ? I said I 'm sorry ! - No ! I don 't want you to beg ! I 'm just ... I 'm not ready to talk . Just because you 're ready to talk , it doesn 't mean that I am . Okay . I 'm sorry , I ... Pilot 's - Pilot 's got two more hatches for me to check , and I just want to do that first , okay ? Fine . Fine . Okay . That 's just about the last of the DRD 's . If Crichton 's correct , they should give us some indication of where the signal 's coming from . What 's the matter ? Ah ... nothing . Have you got One-Eye working yet ? Not yet , I think it 's the energy exchanger , but ... that can wait . Don 't worry about me , Stark . It 's all right . Let me look at your head . - No , just stop ! - I said let me look at it ! Let me look at it now ! The sores are worse . The weakening is progressing ... - Stark ... don 't ... - ... much faster , much faster than we predicted ... much ... . but I I will find you a planet . A planet with the right soil and moisture . Calm yourself , Stark . Please . You 're the expert here . You 've witnessed more death that anyone else . So many dissatisfied souls dying before they felt ready . Yes . I 'm an expert on dying ... I 'm just not an expert on you dying . All right , Moordil . Looks like some kind of binary code followed by four circles . You 've reached the lower pod . Keep going for another 300 metras . Got it . Help ! Hello ? Hello ? Is anyone there ? Hello ? You think he knows ? - How could he know ? - He looked at me ... like he knew . - What are you going to tell him ? - I 'm not gonna tell him anything ? Tell who ? Crichton ... We ah ... we don 't know what to tell him about the guy cacking I 'm sure he 'll understand it wasn 't your fault . I thought Pilot wanted you to reseal the hatch . I was on my way down to help you . He did ... he does . We 're going now . What 's that smell ? I told you , it 's just the scented ... . - wash . - You know ... the perfumed wash . No , no , no . There 's something else . Well , I don 't smell anything . Why are you both in here ? I told you , we were just checking on the dead guy . I don 't believe you . Did you talk to Rygel ? About what ? You have betrayed me . - D 'Argo ... - With my own manin . - I 'm not your manin . - Obviously . - I didn 't mean that , I ... - Well , what did you mean ? - D 'Argo , let 's not ... - Let 's not what ? Get angry . Or ... kill you ? Do you know what this is ? D 'Argo , this is my fault ... mine , not Jothee 's . Get away from me now . It 's a Union Tattoo . It 's a Luxan symbol of courage , honor ... and loyalty . I was going to give it to Chiana , but I was wrong . I want you to have it . - D 'Argo , I don 't want to have to ... - No , I insist that you have it ! - D 'Argo let him go ! - Get away from me ! D 'Argo ! But you ... you will never get these . D 'Argo , listen to me . No ! I will never listen to anything either of you have to say again . I know what it was I smelled before . It was a burned out function cell in the cryo-chamber . There . What is it ? I don 't know . What 'cha got ? The signal 's coming from here ! From here ? Crichton , Borlik , back off ! But , I 'm-I 'm not sending out any frelling signal . See I told you . What ? Why is it making this noise ? Why is it making that noise ? Obviously , you haven 't fixed it properly ! You sure One-Eye 's workin ' right ? It 's working . No , it 's broken ! Give him the Scooby Doo Snack , then . Where 's the signal coming from ? Dude , she 's stuck , man . She 's still broadcasting . Yeah , but where 's the signal coming from ? I think it 's coming from inside her . Inside her ? Is that why she 's stuck to the wall ? I don 't know . She 's somehow magnetized herself to the pipe . Okay . Enough . Let 's kill her , cut her off the frelling pipe and chuck her out . No , no , no , no . That pipe is hydro-honium steel . Frozen exhaust . If you rupture it ... we 'll freeze in ten microts . Worm . Are you ready to die in the cleansing apocalypse ? Worm ? ! Are you ready to die in a cleansing ramming ? Rygel , cut it out . I 'm gonna kill the bitch now ! Rygel , we don 't know what 's going on . We don 't know anything , so we don 't know if killing her will stop the damn signal . Who cares ? ! It 'll shut her up , and make me feel good ! Buckwheat ! Stop it ! Go on , kill me ! Shoot me ! Cut me into pieces and burn my flesh with selic acid , but my broadcast will still be sent . The apocalypse will cleanse you all . At least let me shut her up . Shove it in deep , Rygel . Pilot , how long before that storm hits . It seems to be increasing in velocity . Probably less than an arn . But I was thinking ... since the pipe Borlik 's magnetized to ... is made of hydro-honium steel ... perhaps if we found a larger source of it ... It would pull her away from the pipe . Good , we have any of that hydro-crap on board ? Running an inventory check now . ... you might have to forget about the kid . Shhh ... I think I heard something . Well , make it quick . You 've got less than an arn . Yes , I 'm here . I just need to know where you are ! Keep making noise ! Yeah , hang on ! I 'm coming ! I 'll follow your voice ! I 've located three sources of hydro-steel . Two are in the neural cluster cooling rods . Can we get to it ? Not in time . But the third source is accessible . The cryo-chambers you brought aboard are lined with hydro-steel . The attraction from one of them could pull Borlik loose . Good , so we drag her on board Moya , fly as far away from the station as we can divert the storm . But we 're still trapped by the docking cables . I 've tried to pull us clear , but I can 't . Right , well , find D 'Argo . Tell him I need his help on this . I 've been signaling his comms , but he 's not answering . Why not ? I think I might know why . Hey , D. How you doin ' ? You know , don 't you ? Yeah . Did you know when I showed you the Union Tattoos ? No , I didn 't . They 're bragging about it , aren 't they ? D 'Argo , it 's not like that . Rygel found out and he told me what ... We do not have time for this . Yes , I know . I heard you talking to Pilot . You want me to go outside and help free Moya . While I go grab Borlik . Well , why don 't you get Chiana and Jothee to do it ? They like working together D 'Argo ! They can 't free the cable . They 're not as strong as you are . They 're not as brave , they 're not as smart ... Oh , look , don 't ! All right , just don 't ! They broke my heart , John . I know that . But if you don 't go out on Moya and pull that cable off ... we 're all gonna die when that storm hits . Then we all die . I can 't hear you anymore ! Hello ? Are you still there ? Can you hear me ? Hello ? Frell ! Hello ! ? What were you thinking ? Obviously , we weren 't thinking . Obviously ? We didn 't think we 'd get cau ... Do you know what you did ? You betrayed the one person on this ship , who would have done anything for you . Both of you ! He would have died for you . " Yeah , we need you D 'Argo . " " We ... need you " . " Oh , and by the way ... would you mind putting your hands against the wall and spreading your legs ... so I can kick you up the mivonks ? 'Cause you have got to be one dumb tresnak . " I 'm starting depressurization . I 've created an intertial field on Moya 's skin so you can move around some . But be careful ... the winds are reaching speeds of 300 nilits . I 've got a breathing regulator in case I have to stay out there . Crichton told me you weren 't going out . Well , you know what ? I changed my mind . Why ? Goodbye , Pilot . D 'Argo ? D 'Argo ? I 'm outside , Pilot . Where are the cables ? Just looking now , D 'Argo . Hammond side . Got it . Take the gag out . Oh , you want to hear this ? See , I see your fear , worm . But the Holy Gezma will embrace even you , if you repent . Repent ? We have less than an arn . I was a Dominar ! It 'd take me longer than that to repent . One about to die , you should feel more shame . Hey ' fridge magnet . I got something for you to feel . What is that ? Oh , what 's the matter ? Is that your fear I see ? You 're not so psycho happy now . What are you doing ? This is hydro-steel . Just like that pipe . Only this is bigger . So it may be your turn to repent . For all the souls you 've murdered ! Don 't ! Keep it away ! Got her , Pilot . We 're coming back to Moya . We 'll try to free her up . Crichton , don 't you know ? D 'Argo 's already outside . Pilot , I 've cleared Moya of all the cables except for two . Be careful , those last cables are pulse rechargers . Can you shut them down ? I have no control over them . They are linked to the stations power source . But I can 't move them unless they are neutralized . Crichton 's on his way . He can help you . No ! I can do this alone . D 'Argo , listen to me . Wait for Crichton , he 'll ... No , Chiana ! You can never tell me what to do , ever again . Crichton . Talk to D 'Argo . Talk to him now . D 'Argo . D 'Argo what are you doin ' out there ? What you asked me to . When I neutralize these cables you 'll be able to pull Moya clear . Wait ! Wait for me ! Goodbye , John . No ! Don 't do it ! Pilot , why the hell did you let him go out ? He didn 't ask for my permission . You could have stopped him ! I would shut-up and stop wasting time , Commander . You 're tellin ' the wrong person to shut up . We have less than a quarter of an arn before the storm funnel reaches us . Any signal yet , Pilot ? Nothing . Crichton , if you are unable to save D 'Argo ... Moya is willing to try to rip free from the cables , but ... No , no , no . I 'll get us clear . Is he dead ? Is my father dead ? I don 't know . I 'll go with you . I 'm half Luxan , I can survive out there , I 'll help ... You don 't know that , Jothee , and I can 't be rescuing two people ... now get out of here . Get out of here ! You 're slowing me down ! Crichton , no ... ! Do you see him ? Not yet , Pilot . D 'Argo ? Pilot , he 's not responding . I 'm gonna fix the ship first , then go after him . Get to him . Get to him , now . Heading for the cables . I 'm coming out there myself . No , Chiana ! Stay the hell where you are ! Frell ! Help me ! Hang on , I 'm almost there ! Help me ! Please ! Hurry ! Save them ! I should have known Borlik was one of them ... . a Kampek ! Pilot , I can 't ... Right , I 'm at the access hatch . Moordil , what 's the code ? Moordil ! What 's frelling code ? ! I can 't hear you ! Moordil ? By the Goddess . What 's the frelling code ? ! Aeryn , he 's dead . Moordil 's dead . Get back now , we 've got to get out now ! No way , not yet . Just hope this works . Frell me dead . Have you reached him ? Not yet , I 'll get to him soon . Get to him now . Chiana , I 'm busy , and if I don 't ... whoa ! John ! I 've got you . D 'Argo ! Let 's get the cable . You all right ? All right , on my count ... one ... two ... three ! That 's it , Pilot . Moya 's free ; we 're comin ' in . Hurry ! We must draw the storm away from the station now ! Aw , man ... what are you doin ' ? Hell ... I 'm not goin ' in without you D 'Argo . Keep moving ... that way ... Zhaan , what 's going on ? We 're getting the dren knocked out of us down here . Aeryn , hurry . You must get back here ! Moya 's free , but the storm may still hit us ! Well , if it does , I don 't think we 're going to make it . Hurry ! Come on , move it ! Is he alive ? ! He 's alive . Look after him . D 'Argo ... Crichton , where is he ? ! He 's with Chiana . Pilot , are we moving ? Attempting Starburst ... No ! In Starburst the storm won 't be able to track Borlik 's signal ! Accelerating , now . I thought you were going to die out there . ... hey , come here . I want ... you both ... to stay away from me ! Don 't ... Commuter forecast on your travel day : storms expected just for you ... I think I 'll be able to share my purification . It took all my strength ... but I was able to reconfigure the magnetics and stick here . By the time you cut me down ... the storm will be upon us . You 're too smart . Where are you going ? Uh , you win ... we lose ... you , you outsmarted us . But that door you 're stuck to ? It 's detachable . - No ! - Yes . No , you lie ! No , you will still be purified ! The Holy Gezma 's punishment will be brought down upon ... Blah-blah , blah-blah , blah - Pilot , I 'm clear . Detach the door ... and suck this bitch out ! There you go . That 's it . Watch your head . Good . Thank the Goddess . The children are safe . Now we must find a planet where you can regain your strength . If she so wishes it . Been , ah ... thinking about that thing we talked about . About charity ... and ah ... maybe ... Maybe you were right . We should do nothing . What about body fluids ? There 'll be a back log . Fluid levels ? Back log ? Is there some kind of problem ? Shut up . What did I say ? - Shut up ! - Shut up ! You really gonna ... gonna leave without saying anything ? Yeah . D 'Argo 's right . I know nothing of Luxan honor or integrity . I 'm a half Luxan . I betrayed him ... and if I stay ... I 'll probably do it again . It wasn 't all your fault . Yeah , I never figured that bit . Why did you do it ? I don 't know . D 'Argo had plans for ... for me ... for a stupid farm . I didn 't want any of them . I knew he wouldn 't take no for an answer , so I ... I figured I had to do something he 'd never forgive . You used me . Yeah . A little . But you enjoyed it ... didn 't you ? Tell my father ... if he 'll let you . That I 'm sorry ... and that one day ... I 'll return ... and make it up to you both . I 'll tell him . SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

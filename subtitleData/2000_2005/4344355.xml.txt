 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . Angela . We belong together . Angela . Who 's there ? Shit . - Fresh coffee . Just made it . - Thanks . I think three down , " port vessel , " is " bottle , " not " tender . " - " Bottle " ? - Yeah . I mean ... a port vessel is a tender , you 're right ... but Times ' crossword can be a real head-tripper . Yeah . This guy 's tough . I mean , he always goes for the double meaning . Yeah . So " port vessel " is a bottle , you know , like ... - My name 's Penny , by the way . - Hi . Chuck . Pleasure . " Port vessel " is the thing that holds , you know , port wine , not port in a harbour . Oh , right , right . That 'll go with fifteen across . It 's ... I 'll be damned . Ain 't nobody here . You 're closed . No sweat . I thought I 'd leave you be while I cleaned up . Hell , you got to watch out for that . This is a Friday puzzle . I 'd have been here all night . All Friday night with a puzzle ? Sounds like a party . You got no girl ? - I had a wife . - Divorced ? - No . - Oh . - So ... Jesus . You 're ... - Yeah . I 'm sorry . I 'm new here . I heard you were a regular . I 'm sorry . No , don 't be sorry . It 's nothing . So are you married ? I don 't think I 'm cut out for marriage . Some people are like Comanches , you know ? They like to mount up and go . Yeah , I hear you . That 's me . Do you date ? Not that it 's any of my business . Date ? Well , no ... you know , because , I 've been thinking , I don 't know if I 'm ready for ... A nightcap ? What , are you asking me ? You really have been off the planet for a while , huh ? I sure have . Well , I 'm not asking you to go to the moon , Mr Spaceman . I 'm just saying , a drink around the corner ... but I don 't wanna give the wrong impression . No , wait a minute , wait a minute . You didn 't give me a wrong impression . A nightcap would be ... Yeah , it 'd be nice . But maybe some other time . Sure . - Okay . Penny . - That 's right . All right , Penny . I guess ... - I 'll see you around the campus . - Sure . Bananas flambé . Perfect . - Banane flambée pour Madame . - Thank you . A little calvados to wash it down . I really have to get to the hospital after the flambé . Of course , of course . If you get to find the time ... I promise you a five-course , gourmet meal . - You don 't have to go to all that trouble . - Oh , no , no . I know . But I 'm just looking for a fellow night owl . Besides , between holding the night shift and caring for Zack ... you deserve special treatment . - Cheers , Claire . - Cheers . Excuse me . - Yes ? - Kurt ? It 's me , Angela . - And what is it ? I have company . - Oh , sorry . Didn 't mean to interrupt your latest tryst . No , not that kind of company . Are you okay ? It came back . - It ? - Yeah . You know what I 'm talking about . - Oh , yeah . The thing , the presence ? - Yeah . Whatever the fuck it is . This time it was right in my face . - Are you all right ? - No . - All right . I 'm coming over . - Okay . A ring on your finger doesn 't mean anything . Ouch . You 're strangers until the shit hits the fan ... and that 's when you know who you 're in bed with . Guess I can 't argue with that . I always knew Paul was gonna let me down . - Just happened differently before . - Before ? That 's the past . - He 's pissed he had to bring Corey back ? - Pissed doesn 't even begin to describe it . - Good . What he did was wrong . - Yeah . And he has to be on his best behaviour . Between him accusing me of child abuse ... and me accusing him of parental kidnapping ... the judge threatened to put Corey into foster care . He withdrew the charge ? He agreed to unsupervised visitation . Corey 's coming by tomorrow . - Can 't wait to meet him . - You can 't ? That surprises you ? No . I know you love kids . I mean , I know that you are the kind of man who would love kids . Yeah , you read me like a book . God , Troy , I bring so much baggage into this . Look , I 'll carry yours if you carry mine . - Open the door . - Oh . Yeah . - Hi . - All right ? Yeah . I thought we determined that it could get around chained doors . Yeah , well , better safe than sorry . Is that thing loaded ? Air Force , Kurt . Know how to handle a weapon . Next time I strafe a munitions depot , remind me to call you . - None of it 's broken . - There 's nothing in or out . What the hell 's going on ? I don 't know . Maybe we 're dealing with an entirely new form of Synthetic . You tell me . Well , it 's almost as if it isn 't solid . And when it happens , there 's this cold . It 's like a chill comes over me . Angela , shall we talk about extracurricular activities ? Any form of recreational drugs ? - Oh . - LSD , PCP ? Jesus Christ , Kurt . No . And this isn 't a flashback . - How about a dream or a vision ? - Well , it seems real . Four nights ago , two nights ago , tonight . I don 't know . Like , yeah , okay . It 's possible . Well , you know , most visions occur when you 're recovering from a deep sleep . It 's called a hypnagogic state . The mind plays tricks on you . Especially in forms of underlying stress or mental condition . - Great . So I 'm fucked in the head ? - No , no . That 's not what I meant . But there 's only one way to find out . - No . I am not going to a shrink . - No shrinks . I just need to tape you sleeping . Oh , yeah . Leave it to you to find the soft-core potential in a crisis . That 's not what I meant . Although , I have to admit , I 'm touched that you called and that you care . - Don 't let it go to your head . - I won 't . And you won 't let it . Ah , bananas flambé . Sure looks like a tryst . No , it 's not that . It 's Zack 's mother . You know , the boy the Synthetic put in a coma . - Food therapy ? - It 's more like penitence , darling . Well , he may still recover . I mean , people come out of comas weeks , months , even years after . I sincerely hope so . Help . What happened ? Did you see something ? Apparently , we 're experiencing that same drug flashback . - You saw it ? - Yeah . There 's no point in leaving now . It seems to be following you . - Great . - Yeah . We 'll see if it comes back . Hello . I thought I was done waking up in your bed . - Care to wager on that ? - I really should . Easy money . Oh , thanks . Good thing I 'm such a confident fellow . - Yeah . Still all sealed up . - Well , that didn 't stop our visitor . Take a look at this . Shit . A new type of synthetic that just appears out of thin air ? - Precisely . - And I thought Kitten was a freak . How does a Synthetic appear out of nothing ? Well , how would I know ? I 'm not a tech student . No . Except when you 're growing things in tanks . Well , mea fucking culpa . You don 't need to make me feel guilty . I 'm doing fine on my own , thank you very much . - Oh , my God . - What is it ? - Do you know him ? - Yeah . - Who is it ? - It looks like Gus Hagan . The pilot ? Yeah . But he died two years ago . - Hagan ? - Check . - Perry ? - Check . Shuttle crew Houston , commence simulation . - This is it . - Don 't sweat it , Ange . We 'll do great . Okay . We 're coming in . - You got the landing strip in sight , Perry ? - Affirmative , Hagan . Affirmative ? What are we , back in the Air Force , babe ? Let 's hope not , babe , 'cause back there , I outrank you . You hearing that , boys ? We got a wild one on our hands . - Roger that , Hagan . - Here we go . - Flight Tower , are we clear ? - Shuttle crew Houston , all clear for landing . We 're booming . We 're coming in fast and low . - You 're off course , Hagan . - Yeah . No , no . Not according to the computer . You 're too low . You got 20 seconds to pull out . - Can you see the lights ? - Yeah . I got them . We 're on course . - Ten seconds . - We 're eyeballing it . We 're coming in . Five seconds . - Shuttle crew Houston , well done . - Yeah . - Got you down at 72-14-15 . Welcome home . - Nice save . - Yeah , and thanks for backing me up . - I 'll always be there for you . Listen , I got Sully 's cabin for the weekend . What do you say you and I go up there ? All right , just the two of us ? - Gus ... - I 'm gonna keep asking . And I 'm gonna keep saying no . Look , you gotta let that shit go . It 's never gonna happen . I love you . You 're the only woman I 've ever said that to . You are a piece of work , Gus . - I 'm seeing someone and you know it . - Yeah . That pussy , Mendel ? Look , we can be friends , or we can not be friends . Your call . I saw my mother after she died . I was in my college dorm room ... and she walked right through the door , looked at me and then she smiled . - Then she was gone . - Yeah , but you were dreaming . About an hour or so later , my father called me ... and told me that she had had a heart attack . Passed away in the ambulance . Yeah , well , I got my head around aliens that talk in computer code . - Now I gotta do ghosts . - Step out of the box , Chuckie . No , wait . You , super-sceptic , you believe in ghosts ? Well , who knows ? I mean , the great thinker Jung ... speculated that the dead live in a parallel state that 's invisible ... because it exists at a higher frequency . And quantum physics , anyway , blasted the whole notion of a material universe ... - straight to hell , if you 'll pardon the pun . - Wait . What ? Well , given the notion that atoms aren 't things , but processes ... then matter becomes something of an illusion . It kind of opens the door to the immaterial world . Wouldn 't you say ? Yeah , I 'd say , if I understood what the fuck you were yapping about . He 's saying Angela is being haunted by her dead lover . - Is that what he 's saying ? - This is bullshit , and he wasn 't a lover . - No , it was just a fling , a tryst . - He was a friend , Kurt . And maybe something you 're personally unfamiliar with ... but might be a concept you have heard of . Well , it sounds vaguely familiar , darling . He 's not a fucking ghost . He showed up on the imager . - That means he 's substance . - Yeah . Maybe he was synthetic . The image is thermographic . All it says is that it was way below human body temperature . That 's all . - Like a ghost . - Oh , my ... The real question we should be asking ourselves is ... what is his unfinished business ? Unfinished business . Horseshit . He 's not a goddamn ghost . You saw somebody you used to go out with ... who 's still alive , walking around . I mean , you tell me he 's a Martian . Tell me he lives in another dimension ... or one of these motherfucking freaks that bleeds white ooze , I 'll buy that . But a goddamn spirit walking around planet E with an agenda ? I say that 's horseshit . I say Gus Hagan is alive . We gotta find out what the hell he wants and find that out now . - Is this a call to action , Chuckie ? - What the fuck 's it look like , Kurt ? You can sit on your ass if you want . Fine with me . - This guy Gus has got some kind of ... - Family ? - Yeah . - Yeah . A sister . - A sister . Well , let 's go talk to her . - All right . See you . I felt a chill ... like a shiver running up my spine ... and for some reason I thought , " He 's back . " It was like I felt his presence . - Do you remember when this was ? - Six months ago and a year before that . - Of course , I was dreaming . - Well , that 's only natural . My brother 's death was so awful . There was no answers , no closure , as they say . I 'm a red-blooded American , don 't get me wrong . But , boy , did I hate Uncle Sam for a while there . Yeah . You and everybody else ... who 's lost someone to undisclosed circumstances . - Did you get to identify the body ? - They never even found him . No ashes , no burial . Just a lonely headstone with nothing at all underneath . - How did they say he died ? - They didn 't . " What was the mission ? " " Classified . " " Well , how did he die ? " " Classified . " " Well , was it NASA , Air Force or the damn CIA ? " All I know , and that 's just because somebody slipped ... - is that it happened near Bay City . - Bay City . - The town that Ravin built . - Ravin ? It 's a NASA supplier . They make the booster rockets ... and gizmos , you know , that make a test shuttle go up in the air . Did you get any of Gus ' personal effects ? Just his uniform and American flag . That 's all I 've got to remember him by . Well ... - Anything that I can do , I ... - No . Finally meeting you is enough . God , Gus loved you so much . He always said you were the girl he was gonna marry . Seven , eight , nine and ten . Ready or not , here I come . Now where could that boy be ? Behind the couch ? Nope . Under the coffee table . No . Did he use his invisible ray gun to disappear ? 'Cause that 's not fair . Doorbell . Excuse me . How can I find him if he doesn 't play by the rules ? I found you . And now I 'm gonna have to tickle you , I think . - I got you . I 'll tickle you . - Troy . - I got ... - Troy . Daddy . Troy , you remember Paul . Paul , Troy . Hey . We 're playing hide-and-go-seek . Wanna play with us ? No . We gotta go , Corey . Come on , let 's get your stuff . Come on . - I wanna play . - Corey , let 's not ... Honey , it 's okay . - You 'll be back in a couple of days . - When ? This many . - Troy , will you be here , too ? - Maybe . We 'll see . It 's frankly a relief , Commander , to be dealing with a familiar face . As defence contractors , you can only imagine how popular we are . I mean , I 've seen it all . Iraqi spies posing as janitors , bribery , blackmail , honey traps . Yeah , there 's spooks everywhere in the world ... and we understand your need for secrecy , but can you answer our question ? Well , there 's not much I can tell you . It 's classified all the way up . - Per NASA or the Air Force ? - I can 't say . We can only hope in cases like these that a few years down the road ... they declassify the files . You know , as the technology changes or the world does . You know , without enemies , there 's not a lot of need for secrets . Well , back to the point , we know that Gus was testing some of your equipment ... - when he disappeared . - Well , he died . - And his death was a hell of a tragedy . - Wait , wait . If there ain 't no body , how do you know he died ? I wish I could help you , but there 's nothing more I can tell you . He was a brave pilot . As brave as they come . I just hope he 's at peace . Do you have any reason to believe he 's not at peace , Dr Steiger ? I 'm sorry to cut this short , but they don 't look kindly on us ... even thinking about what we 're not allowed to discuss . Thank you so much . Shall we ? Bullshit stonewalling . I don 't know how they live with themselves . Little corporate creeps . But , somebody 's got to manufacture our weapons of mass destruction . He knew something . They both did . I think Steiger felt a little guilty . - Not that that made him come clean or any ... - What did you expect ? Well , Chuck got them to admit it was an experiment . - As opposed to ? - Him dying in a minefield in Tora Bora . Something about it just made them a little spooked . Especially Steiger . He said , " I just hope he 's at peace . " Like maybe he isn 't ? Come on , Kurt . You don 't believe in an afterlife . I believe in that which I can quantify . Quantum physics , yes . Gods , goblins and ghosts , no . Besides , not believing in an afterlife ... helps justify my hedonistic existence , darling . Well , I 'm glad I believe in God . I would hate to find myself using atheism to rationalise group sex . It 's agnosticism , actually , darling . I 'll believe it when I see it . What the hell is this ? A power surge ? Angela , look at this . What the hell ? What ? What 's going on ? Gus ? - Ange , come with me . - No . - Angela , let go of him . - I can 't . - Angela , let go . - I can 't ! Let go ! Oh , God . - You okay ? - Yeah . - Kurt . - Yeah ? I 'm okay . - Yes . - Yeah . - Yes , of course . - Let 's get up . All he 's really doing is causing electrical disturbances , right ? So maybe that 's his way of communicating . You know , if he really is a restless spirit , then maybe he needs to do ... or say something before he can , you know , go into the light . Can we please stop with the ghost stuff ? I 'm ... You want my two cents ? The Cadre is behind this . Hodge and that little paranoid group of hers had done something serious to that boy . And now he 's pissed off , and now he 's here ... and he ain 't going back from whence he came anytime soon . - Incoming . - Angela . - Hello ? - Angela , ask him what he needs . What ? Gus , are you here ? Gus , are you here ? I feel like a jerk . Well , maybe , but he 's listening . He 's listening . Gus , where are you ? Jesus ! You know , in my humble opinion ... I think we should get the fuck out of here ! Thank you . Bloody hell , all the circuits are fried . According to the fire department ... the entire electrical system has to be replaced . Out of pocket , of course . Angela , your boyfriend 's got some funky way of communicating . Yeah . What he 's communicating is some serious inner rage . Well , perhaps detonating electrical systems is some new kind of performance art . - Very funny . - Okay . What am I looking for here ? I don 't know . Any pattern or reason for these manifestations , basically . - You mean , other than Angela ? - I 'd come back from the dead for that face . Who wouldn 't ? Okay . Check this out . There is a pattern to these manifestations after all . You 're right . Here 's one and 12 hours later . Then a second six hours later , then three hours . These manifestations have a half-life . Yeah , you know , Gus ' sister said that she saw him the first time a year ago ... - and then six months ago . - That 's right . And you saw him four days ago , then two days and then last night . So what happens when these half-lives run out ? Well , we don 't know what happens , but we can sure as hell tell when ... which is pretty damn soon . Hello ? Dr Steiger . Yeah , I remember you . Sure . Do you know a diner called The Canary ? Yep . Great . We 'll meet you there . Not the diner . - Well , hello there , you . - Hey , you . - New friend ? - Some have greatness thrust upon us . - Hello . - Hello . Ravin won a contract to test an experimental technology for NASA . Don 't you have that backwards , Doc ? Yeah . I think you do . NASA doesn 't build this shit . - You guys build it for us . - No . This was different . I 'm not even sure it went through official channels . And what is " it " ? - This may seem incredible . - Oh , well , then hold on . Okay . I think we can handle it . Go ahead . - Superstrings . - Superstrings . We were able to change the frequency at which they vibrate in the human body ... by bombarding them with energy . Mega-frequency radio waves , to be exact . Sending Hagan into another dimension . - Now that is incredible . - Yes , it is . But something went wrong . We couldn 't control the resultant frequency of the superstrings . And we lost him . - We couldn 't publish the truth , of course . - Of course . So he was declared MIA , and we closed the book on the project . How can you experiment on human beings like that ? We were caught up in the possibilities . There 's no way to overstate the significance of such a breakthrough . Not to mention the military applications , right ? - Call it naive , call it idealistic . - Call it stupid . All right . You 're right . But now I think we can undo this terrible experiment and bring him home . One minute . The energy he absorbed in the experiment has a half-life . It 's decaying in a series of waves . As he rids his body of the excess energy ... Hagan 's returning to a material state in this dimension . Thus , the power surges . Combined with his obvious needs for anger management . We don 't know he controls these surges . We know the surges are damn dangerous . Twenty seconds till Claude Rains . You know , when you showed up ... you made me glad that Lieutenant Hagan was still out there . - I spent two years praying for this . - Ten seconds . You know , I don 't ever recall telling you that Hagan was out there . Four , three , two , one . Showtime . He 's here . - It 's getting kind of nippy in here . - Yeah . He always lowers the temperature . The high frequency of his superstrings is slowing down the air molecules around him . They 're creating cold pockets . Which explains how it 's showing on the thermographic imager . Ange . Lieutenant Hagan . You found your way back . Our project can still work . The principles are sound . Look at you . You 're the proof of that . Steiger , what in the hell are you talking about ? What you know can change our understanding of the universe . You 're a hero . The first explorer in another dimension . Steiger , you are playing with fire . You do not know the state of this man 's mind . You signed up for this . You need to see it through . - It 's your duty . - What the hell do you know about duty ? Lieutenant Hagan . We can make it work ! It already works . No ! No . He 's gone . Hey . Just here to say goodbye , babe . - Where are you going ? - It 's a new assignment . Black ops . - You took it ? - Yep . You don 't even know what it is . They could be testing nerve gas on you . I already signed the waiver . This is a dumb game . I 'm not the one playing games . - You took this on account of me . - Yeah . I thought you 'd feel more comfortable with me gone . You thought I 'd beg you to stay . My mistake . I think you know the way out . Now , Angela , you gotta stop taking this on yourself , honey . If it weren 't for me , he wouldn 't have volunteered . Horseshit . You 're looking at it sideways . Life coughs up very few victims . Most of us are volunteers . This boy volunteered for everything . There were a lot of Germans that weren 't Nazis . And most religious peoples of the world ... don 't wanna pick up a gun and shoot somebody . They got a choice . This boy had a choice . He made it . All right . The next pass is gonna be in about 10 minutes . Why don 't we get the hell out of here , you guys ? Yeah , well , it doesn 't matter , 'cause he 's gonna find her . Plus which , we can control the environment right here . We stay put . I don 't want you guys risking your lives for me . Well , that 's too damn bad . We are . Look , he could kill us all . We better come up with a plan B , pronto . Anybody got any ideas ? Kurt ? - Not a single one , no . - Well , I 've been mulling one over . That God machine in Lost Hills ... whatever the hell came out of it liked the heat , and you froze it . Hagan seems to like cold ... So we put Angela in the hottest place possible and hope he can 't resist the bait . It 's worth a shot . - Let 's do it . - All right . Usually takes about 10 minutes for this heat to get really unbearable . It 's already unbearable right now . - What 's that for ? - A Hail Mary . - Here . You 're up . - Thanks . Hold this . Do you have any idea why your friend 's so angry ? Other than being trapped in another dimension for two years ? Well , he seems to have quite a thing for you . Yeah . But I 'm seeing someone else . No wonder he hates me . I 'd hate the man who took you away from me . Here we go . - What ? - What ? Quiet , you guys . - Gus ? - Angela . - You okay ? - Ange , where is he ? - Are you all right ? - He 's gone around her . Kurt ! Hold her down , tackle her . Do something ! Get out of there . Get out of the way ! Oh , shit . The heat made him stronger . Is he dead ? - I don 't know . Where 's the body ? - Hopefully bleeding in another dimension . Hey ! Neil , get out of the way ! We can only hurt him if we can see him . Hey , you okay ? You all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay , I 'm okay . - Son of a bitch . - Angela . Angela , wait ! - Hey , Angela ! - Angela ! She locked the fucking door ! Hey , open up ! - She 's just trying to protect us . - Angela , open up ! Shit . She got it braced . - Angela ! - Angela , open the door ! - Angela , open the door ! - Angela , open the damn door ! - Angela ! - Angela , get up here and open this door ! Gus ? Gus , come on . This is between the two of us . Leave them alone . Come on , let me see you . Gus ? Come on , we 're friends . Remember ? If only you 'd asked me that two years ago . I would 've done anything for you . - My God , you so fucking ruined everything . - This isn 't you . You 're not a killer . The experiment did something to you . I used to love you . - Don 't do this . - It 's your fault . We belong together . - Lf I can 't have you , then no one will . - Don 't . I still love you so much . - So I 'm gonna make this painless . - No ! Angela ! - Angela ! - Angela ! Angela ! I 'm sorry . Well , another great piece of handiwork . After all , you just killed a man who died two years ago . Hey , Kurt , come on . Keep the volume down , huh ? You know , you 're about as sensitive as this fork . - Excuse me . - Hey , ghost or no ghost , Gus is dead . Angela 's got no regrets . Voila . Well , yours truly managed fine without becoming a homicidal maniac . Well , for all we know , it could 've been the technology that made him homicidal . You know , this same government can 't even eliminate poverty or hunger . I don 't think the government had jack shit to do with it . - Cadre ? - The Cadre . Can 't wait to get to the bottom of those freaks . Neither can I , if I understood what the fuck you were yapping about . Yeah , you are speaking in tongues . What are you talking about ? No , no , no . You didn 't tell them ? I 'll tell you what it is . Chuckie has a new secret , ladies and gentlemen . Elvis is actually dead . Don 't get your tit in a ringer , Kurt . Now here 's the deal . We got a little problem with the infrastructure at NASA . See , the reason why I told Angela and Neil about it is because they 're NASA pilots . So , here goes . Layton Scott , an original Apollo astronaut , a man who walked on the moon ... and my friend and mentor , is dying of Lou Gehrig 's disease . Now , before he disappeared into the bowels of the hospital ... to which I am barred by his daughter ... he warned me about a group in NASA , called the Cadre . Wait a minute . You 're saying that Bright Sky might be hooked up ... to some inner sanctum , star chamber sort of thing inside of NASA ? Yeah . That 's what I 'm saying . Oh , great . Not only are we dealing with the coming of Armageddon ... but now you 're telling me a secret society is running ... the entire fucking space programme . - Maybe . - Wonderful . I 'm out of here . - Here we go again . - You should 've told them . Should 've , would 've , could 've . Kurt ! Kurt ! Thank God you 're here . I thought I had the wrong night . Please , come in . Please . No . - I thought there was a blip on his ... - EEG ? Yeah . But it was nothing . I 'm starting to see cross-eyed , staring at that damn thing so long . I could imagine . Please , come in , come in . I have a little wine for you . Here you are . And the cassoulet 's been simmering for hours . Kurt . I don 't need all this . I don 't wanna be entertained . No , no . Of course not . You 're right . I 'm sorry . What can I do to help ? I just need someone to talk to . Of course . I 'm sorry . It 's fine . It 'll be all right . - I want to talk . - I don 't . - Sarah , can we please talk ? - You got a lot of nerve . Listen , listen . I don 't want you exposing our son to strangers . When did you become such an asshole , huh ? You know , Troy is not a stranger . He happens to be very important to me . - And when did that happen ? - That 's none of your goddamn business . Are we finished ? Sarah ... it kills me to see Corey playing with that guy ... like he 's some kind of father figure . Remember , he 's my boy . And I don 't want him looking up to anybody else . You should 've thought about that before you broke up our family . Hey . Yeah , you 're right . I should 've . Troy would never try and take your place . Okay ? And he couldn 't . You 're Corey 's father . Thank you . So ... - you doing okay ? - I 'm fine . You ? Yeah . I 'm just great . We 're closed ... Hey , there , cowboy . Hey , good-looking . You ain 't really closed , are you ? I 'm always open for a friend . - Wasn 't sure I 'd see you . - Well , I was in the neighbourhood . I thought I 'd stop by for a cup of coffee , say hello . Hello , then . Maybe get some help on this Friday night puzzle . Those things are gonna drive you to drink . I got a cup . I 'm busting out already . So you wanna talk about that nightcap ? What I 'd really love is a bowl of that chilli . You got it . And a nine-letter word that means " wrinkle-free . " Wrinkle-free . Polyester ? No , that don 't work . It 's got a " P. " I need an " S. " Oh , I know . Synthetic . Yeah , that 'll work .

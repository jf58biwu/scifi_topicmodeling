 Tokyo ... its people ... its colors ... its contours ... are now just a hazy memory . How could I remember ... what I took for granted ? I could always see it with my own eyes . DRAGONHEAD Teru , catch ! Discipline , young man ! Open up ! Hello ? ! Hey ! Anybody ? Hey ! Hey ! Somebody ! Am I the only one ? They 're all dead . You 're alive . Thank God . I 'm Teru Aoki . From class five . You are ? What happened ? I 'm totally confused . The " end " . Excuse me ? I said it 's the end . End of what ? Morikawa , Kato and Hirata ... Serves them right . All of them killed ... by the red light . Everything 's changed . I 'll have you know that I 've changed , too . What are you talking about ? Did anyone else survive ? What do you think ? Take a good look around . Moron . Seconds ago , you were whining . So don 't give me any crap . The dining car ! You think they 'll come soon ? Who ? Help ... the rescue squad . They won 't come . Of course they will ! Or we won 't make it . The food will spoil in this heat . Stop being so damn negative ! Well , it 's true . Get out ! I said get the hell out ! Now , take it easy . Don 't think you can push me around . OK , just take it easy . Get out ! Beat it ! The guy 's nuts . Who 's there ? You 're hurt . He 's ... he 's crazy . What ? Nobuo . You saw him , didn 't you ? I had to get away from him . Hey , listen ... Did any others survive ? Do you know what happened ? As soon as we entered the tunnel , there was a huge boom . Right before that , some guys had locked Nobuo up in the toilet . It saved him . Takahashi ... Teacher ! Teacher , help me ! Help me , please ! Nobuo ... help . I 'm in pain . Please . I need help . You 're the adult here . You 're in charge , aren 't you ? You 're supposed to help me . Please ... help . Help you ? Why should I ? You sat there doing nothing ... while they beat me . So shut your trap ! You 're supposed to help me ! Help me ! You don 't know this but ... I can dish it out , too . It 's time for a little payback ! Take that ! Who 's pathetic now ? ! You 're normal , right ? Yeah ... well ... You are ? Really ? I think so . Thanks . That guy 's nuts ... going on about red lights . Red light ? Yeah . What in God 's name happened ? An earthquake ? Outside , they should be searching for us by now . Right ? Don 't you think ? We need to treat that wound . Where 're you going ? To find some disinfectant . We have to hang on until help comes . This is madness . Ako Seto . You 're alive . Come . I 'm sorry , Nobuo . I am ! This way . Please ! Come see my new home . Stop ! You 're hurting me . We 've got to get along . We 're all friends here . What 're you doing ? Huh ? We 've got to embrace the darkness . Stop babbling nonsense ! You saw them , too ... the red light . What 's with you and red light ? You didn 't see them , then ? The red flash in the windows ? Bright red . No . It 's not just the tunnel . We 're the only survivors ... anywhere . We 're all that 's left . Our only choice is to live here . We can 't survive in here . It 's too hot . The food will rot . What about water ? No problem . What do you mean ? It 's a problem ! It 's a very big problem ! You 've totally flipped ! Go ahead and live here then ! When help arrives , go hide ! I told you . Nobody 's coming . You don 't know shit , do you ? Shut up ! Hey ... the radio ! I heard a voice ! It 's all over ! Stop it ! Please ! I 'm a lot stronger now . Shut up ! I 'm not listening to you ! You 're a fool ! A weak fool ! He 's all right . Hey , get up ! Hurry ! In here ! Quick ! We 're leaving ! We can 't wait for help to arrive . I warned you . I 'm not a pushover anymore . What 'll we do ? The roof . What ? We ' climb up to it . How ? Hurry ! You OK ? Let 's go . Wait ! Are you serious ? We have no choice . My knee hurts . I 'll pull you up . I can 't . Stay behind with him then ! See if I care . I 'm going home . Wait ! Stop ! We found an exit ! Stop it ! Teru ! Stop it ! Teru , don 't ! Wow , you almost had me there ! Let go ! I made this myself ! Who cares ? Stop it ! Shut up and get moving ! Don 't go ! This is the only safe haven left ! What 's safe about it ? Open your damn eyes ! Please stop ! Let 's go . Hurry up ! I 'm scared . Teru . I can 't . I can 't . Hurry up . I 'm scared . I said hurry ! Nobuo ! Come on ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Teru ! Ako ! Ako ! Move it ! Where 's my souvenir ? How was the trip ? Did you like Kyoto ? Hey . Look ! An exit . What is this ? What 's all this white stuff ? That isn 't the sky , is it ? Is that the sky ? Teru ! Wait up ! Wait ! Where are we ? What is this place ? Be quiet ! Don 't ask so many damn questions . If you don 't know , how in the hell should I ? You don 't have to be such a jerk about it . I 'm just confused , alright ? My knee and throat are killing me . Damn it ! What 's happened ? Somebody tell me ... what the hell do we do now ? I need a doctor for this pain . And some water ... and food . And a bath ... Why do we have to go through this ? Maybe Nobuo was right after all . Then maybe you should 've listened to him . What 're you doing ? Going to look for food and water ... And survivors . But ... You heard the radio , right ? Could 've been just static . We can 't stay here . Just leave me alone . Forget about me . We walked for days through the white ash . Days . Hello ! Anyone ? ! Hello ! Ako ... No water , is there ? We 've got to embrace the darkness . Here ! Ako ! Tea ! Thank you . A town . Huh ? I wonder what 's become of Tokyo ? If we return ... and there 's nobody ... Sorry . I 'm sorry . Teru , what 's wrong ? Are you all right ? Oh , hello . Excuse us but ... We were um ... on a train in a tunnel when ... we had an accident . Or when all this ... happened . But we don 't know anything . What happened here ? How unlucky . You should 've come a few days later . Just think of it ... as bad luck . What are you doing ? Let go ! We decided to end it all . We had no choice . The young ones resisted . What else could we do ? Except pretend that none of it ever happened . It 'll hurt more ... if you move . Well , are you going to attack or what ? You two , get out of here ! Kill them ! What ... what is all this ? How did things come to this ? People killing each other ... saying it had to be . Everyone went mad . Pretend it never happened , they said . Pretend it never happened . Pretend it never happened . Pretend it never ... What happened here ? Hell if I know . Just as I thought . The dragon 's pulse is irregular . Dragon 's pulse ? What does that mean ? I 'll tell you . It 's an underground artery for magma ... disrupted by tectonic activity . Volcanoes ? What the hell else could it be ? It screwed up the magnetic field . What ? Okay , look ... The Earth is like one big , monster magnet . A shift in the earth 's crust ... upsets the Earth 's magnetic balance . Oddly enough , one result is it wreaks neurological havoc ... on all living things . Screw that . You mean ... It drives people mad ? Uh-huh ! Affirmative . He 's borderline , too . Your problem is you don 't listen . Look what they did to our comrades . Massacred for no reason whatsoever ! It pisses the hell out of me ! Average citizens attacking the peacekeepers there to protect them . We 're all that 's left ! You enjoyed using this , though . Screw you ! Insanity everywhere . Everywhere ? It 's like this everywhere ? Tokyo , too ? The more people , the faster panic spreads . Blame magnetism if you like . Up yours ! It 's all Nature 's fault . Can 't blame people for that . I 've heard many rumors . An earthquake set off a few nukes ... a huge meteor fell ... a fiery dragon ... Judgment Day ... You don 't buy that ? Too preposterous ? Damn right ! So mankind was mad even before the magnetic field went haywire . For millennia . This much is certain ... The world was a much different place than you thought . That 's it . Nature 's mystery runs deeper than you could ever imagine . Vanished . Very odd . All this work for nothing . Where are we ? Her husband did this ! What did he do ? He was scared ... so he ... Your husband ? He wanted to protect ... the children 's minds ... remove their fear ... surgically . Jesus ! Isn 't anyone sane ? Anyone at all ? So he was a doctor . I 've heard of him . Said he could remove the lobe that controls fear . Please ... those children won 't mourn my passing . Please ease my pain . Don 't ! It 'll piss him off if I do it . Do it . She wants you to . Kill me . Do as she says . Medicine ! Find medicine ! Where you going ? Saved by the bell . Why ? Your mother just died , you know . You act like nothing happened . Cry for her ! Your mother 's gone . Damn it ! Say something . Circumstances ... brought you two together . So you stayed together , right ? But why ? You thought we would just save you for nothing ? Then why did you save us ? Because I saw some value in it . What is this ? Stick out your tongue . Suck on this . Hold it ! Give it a rest , will ya ? Get a grip , man ! You prefer him , do you ? I suppose he 's more your cup of tea . Enough ! Have it your way . We don 't want your sorry DNA for posterity , anyway . Don 't move ! Don 't be embarrassed . Shut up ! One more move and I 'll ... Why 'd you shoot him ? Magnetic field . You 're right . This won 't do . Why add to our own destruction ? We must strengthen our species . Please , no ! Stop it , please ! I beg of you ! Please don 't kill me ! Please ! I 'll shoot ! I will ! I 'll shoot you ! I will ... Teru ! Teru ! Teru ! Stop the car ! Stop it ! Thank God . Ako ! Ako ! Ako ! Ako ! Teru . Thank God . Are we still alive ? I think so . Why ? Not him , too . I didn 't figure this guy would be one to die . How funny . Serves him right but ... why ? Why am I still alive ? I can 't bear it . Food distribution has begun ... in certain parts of Tokyo . Welcome , everyone ... to wonderful Tokyo . Welcome . How much farther to Tokyo , do you think ? Not that there 's anyone to see . Nobody . They died when I was in junior high . My parents , that is . Traffic accident . When I look at him ... I can 't believe he feels nothing ... no sense of loss . It 's unforgivable . But ... I suppose when you think about it ... with all that 's happened ... he 's really ... better off ... the way he is . I 'm sorry ... I 'm so pathetic ... and weak ... and useless . Just alive . But I promise . I promise we 'll make it home together . Thank you . Excuse me ... Why did you save us ? I said why did you save us ? We were flying low to avoid the ash higher up . You were just lucky we saw you . But you could 've flown on . It 's his penance ... for killing so many . I was just trying to survive . Right on . You said it , man ! Do you know ... anything about Tokyo ? What 's become of it ? Haven 't you heard the radio ? They say there 's order there . And food . Lots of emergency rations underground . Someone found them . In Tokyo , we can survive . Really ? See for yourself . We 'll be there in 20 minutes . What 's up ? Ash in the engine ! It 's stalling ! I 'll fly lower . We must get there ! Let me off ! Let me off ! Keep it together ! Let me off ! Close the door ! Yuriko ! Don 't move ! Hurry and close the door ! Someone , close the door ! Teru ! Teru ! Stabilize the chopper ! I 'm trying ! Ako ! Teru ! Teru ! No ! Teru ! Teru ! Ako . Nobuo . Tokyo : 35 km . Perhaps it 's easier to be consumed by the darkness ... to not feel anything ... remember nothing . I 'm home . At least I think it is . I 'm home , right ? Where 's my souvenir ? How was the trip ? The faster panic spreads ... The dragon 's pulse is irregular . A huge meteor ... A fiery dragon ... Judgment Day ... A shift in the earth 's crust ... upsets the Earth 's magnetic balance . So mankind was mad even before the magnetic field went haywire . For millennia . Embrace the darkness . We 've got to embrace the darkness . Wait ! Hey ... You 're alive . It 's me . I saw the crashed chopper so I thought everyone had died . What about Ako ? Is she still alive ? You 're wasting your time . It 's not just them . Everyone 's like that . I take it you saw the streets . The butchering that took place . Must 've been horrific . Then they found this stored underground . Just for such occasions . Eat this and ... you become like that child ... liberated from fear . You feel nothing . Pathetic , isn 't it ? Right Yuriko ? Hey ... when did you die ? Here ... Tastes pretty good . Sample Ako ? Ako ! Ako ! Ako ! Ako . Not you too , Ako ? Damn it ! Why ? Ako . Teru ? Ako ? Teru . Your family ? I 'm sorry . You didn 't eat it ? No . I didn 't want ... to be like that child . If I can 't cry ... or laugh ... What 's the point ? I wanted to be able to cry thinking about you . You 're all I still have . If you had died ... and left me alone ... I had to be able to cry . Ako . Teru . I was frightened . Ako was the only one crying in that place . Who would invent such a thing ? Food to numb your senses . What kind of world had they foreseen ... for those without it ? Let 's go . Quickly . Get out of here ! You came here to live ! Are you all right ? I 'm fine . You can 't kill us ! We 're going to survive ! What remains ahead is either hope or despair . Nobody can say which it 'll be . It 's a question for the future ... our future .

 At the far reaches of the universe lies a planet of men who have [ br ] advanced technologically beyond the realm [ br ] of human comprehension . There is no breeding . [ br ] They are a product of cloning and their reproductive organs [ br ] have shrunk and disappeared . All emotions have been bred [ br ] out of this race and each succeeding generation has become more ambitious [ br ] and driven than the previous one . They want to rule the universe and now they are planning [ br ] their next takeover from the inside . This planet is four solar systems [ br ] from our own . Across the Sea of Vell , [ br ] at a fixed position of 1 3-6-90 on the subset grid 4-1 0 . It is a solid , rigid mass with a dense core [ br ] of magnetic , metallic liquid . The atmosphere is composed [ br ] of nitrogen , oxygen and argon in amounts of 78 , 21 [ br ] and 1 percent by volume . This is our target . This is Earth . This is where one of you [ br ] will serve your planet to the act of procreation . Your training will be extensive . The Earth woman 's reproductive organs [ br ] are located here . The access point is here . Insertion in any other access point [ br ] will not result in pregnancy . To get the woman in a receptive mood [ br ] for insertion compliment her on these areas . She will also enjoy being told that she smells nice [ br ] and that her footwear is stylish . You will spend many hours in study trying to learn all you can [ br ] about the females of this planet . It is important to a woman that she [ br ] feels you are listening when she speaks . This is most easily achieved by repeating the phrase , " uh-huh , " [ br ] when the woman is communicating . I went to the store this morning . Uh-huh . On the way , the car started making [ br ] a funny noise , so I pulled over . Uh-huh . Then I couldn 't hear it , [ br ] so I started driving again . Then it was fine . You will familiarize yourself with [ br ] her predilections , her customs her ranges of temperament . Her smiles , her frowns . [ br ] Her ups and her downs . - Your footwear is quite fashionable . [ br ] - Thank you . May I insert my penis in you ? Yes . Ten seconds . [ br ] This time is your personal best . Congratulations . You all have performed admirably and your concentration [ br ] has been exemplary but one man has been chosen . This man has excelled [ br ] in his training and we are confident that women [ br ] of Earth will be both interested in and willing to experience [ br ] insertion with him . This man is H-1 449-6 . Congratulations , H-1 449-6 . Or , as you 'll now be referred to , [ br ] Harold Anderson from Seattle , Washington . We 've given you a wealth [ br ] of information about Earth but her people are unpredictable . As with all alien cultures , [ br ] there will be subtleties which we couldn 't prepare you for . However , given your adaptability [ br ] and your capacity for learning we 're certain you 'll achieve [ br ] your goal with ease . The success of our planet 's domination [ br ] of the universe rests in your hands . Thank you , sir . If you go with these men , [ br ] we 'll arrange your transfer and attach your penis . We will begin our descent into [ br ] the Phoenix area in about 30 minutes . Flight crew will be by shortly [ br ] to pick up all food and beverage items . Thank you once again [ br ] for flying Arizona West . What is that ? What ? There . Inbound at our 2 : 00 . - It 's moving . [ br ] - Tell me where to go . Hydraulics ? Landing hydraulics okay . [ br ] Wing and tail hydraulics okay . - We 're losing altitude . [ br ] - Air speed is dropping . What the hell is this ? Collision alert . Collision alert . It 's on us ! Simple people . [ br ] They 're 1 000 years behind us . They haven 't figured out that round [ br ] is the most efficient way to fly . This will be a snap . - Remember , get a woman pregnant . [ br ] - Give me two days . Wait for the baby and then come back . Whatever you do , [ br ] don 't let anyone know the truth . We don 't want another Roswell [ br ] on our hands . That happened because you made [ br ] the mistake of sending H-228-J . That guy was an idiot [ br ] and not as handsome as me . Nowhere near . Hi . Hi . - Hey there . Hey , I like your shoes . [ br ] - What ? Let me give you a hand . Take your seat [ br ] and fasten your seat belt . " Rebecca . " I always wanted my children to have [ br ] a mother named Rebecca . Interested ? Are you all right ? Well , to be honest , I am a little [ br ] lightheaded from that perfume . You smell nice . Sir , if you don 't take your seat , [ br ] I 'll report you when we land . Ouch . Kitty likes to scratch . Anyone sitting here ? Well , there is now . Hi . - You 're shaking . [ br ] - I thought we 'd crash . I like it when a woman shakes . [ br ] Turns me on . What ? - I like your shoes . [ br ] - Thank you . - And you smell nice . [ br ] - Thank you . Going to Phoenix [ br ] on business or pleasure ? I 'm going to see my husband . He 's a pharmacist . He works [ br ] in the pharmaceutical industry . We had a fight before this flight . You shouldn 't fly without saying [ br ] " Sorry " or " I love you . " If I 'd died , [ br ] he 'd still think I was pissed off . Hey , watch the cart , man ! Do you want me to get you a copy of [ br ] the FAA rules and regulations , asswipe ? I do my job , then you do yours . [ br ] Stay out of my way ! They 'll give anybody a fucking badge . - Hello , Mr. Jones . [ br ] - What we got ? It could be bad air , but judging [ br ] from what I 've heard from the crew it sounds a little [ br ] out of the ordinary . - How long you been with the department ? [ br ] - Three months . I 'll do you a favour . [ br ] It 's never out of the ordinary . It 's either a flock of geese , [ br ] a weather balloon or if it 's Friday , [ br ] the crew is drunk . Nadine , what 'd I say [ br ] about using this number ? I said never to call this number [ br ] unless the house is on fire and I don 't hear a siren , [ br ] so this better be good . Yeah , I know today 's our anniversary . [ br ] What makes you think I forgot ? How do you know I 'm not coming home [ br ] with a bunch of flowers or something ? How do you know that ? Nadine , don 't cry . Bye-bye . Bye-bye . A passenger shot some video [ br ] when the incident took place . You might want to look at it . Get a list of passengers and crew . [ br ] Check the cabin , write your report . And if you see anything at all [ br ] interesting , just remember : It 's not . Well , Christmas is early this year . You guys twins ? Asshole . Can you contribute to the mission ? What can I get for 1 50 bucks , [ br ] gorgeous ? What 's that noise ? I don 't hear anything . It 's coming from your pants . There 's something else that comes out [ br ] of my pants . Want to see ? Keep the change . - Can I have your autograph ? [ br ] - What ? - You are Miss America , aren 't you ? [ br ] - Yeah . Who are you ? Mr. Universe ? Hey , where you headed ? Chicago . That 's attractive . The Windy City . [ br ] So what time 's your flight ? Forty minutes . I don 't know what you 're doing [ br ] until then but there 's a Hilton [ br ] across the street . I don 't know if they have [ br ] a 40-minute rate or not , but maybe we could- - Taxi ! - I know who you are . [ br ] - You do ? I know where you 're from too . Really ? New guy from Seattle . [ br ] Commercial and home loans . - How did you know ? [ br ] - My gut . Perry Gordon . [ br ] Commercial and home loans too . Nice to meet you . [ br ] Harold Anderson . Word is , you 're some [ br ] big banking kahuna from up north . Your letters of recommendation [ br ] were unbelievable . They 're not that great . They were . I snuck into Mr. Fisk 's [ br ] office , read every single one . - Who 's that ? [ br ] - That 's Rita . Office manager . I got her a job . Smartest thing I ever did . - Is she- - [ br ] - Too late . All mine . She 's a noisy one too . [ br ] Thank God we work in a bank . Close the vault door , [ br ] nobody hears a thing . She have a friend ? Don 't know . When you want to hit [ br ] the nightspots , call me . Thanks . Great . How about now ? - You 're kidding , right ? [ br ] - No . It 's 1 0 a.m. [ br ] You haven 't met the boss yet . So ? - You got some balls on you . [ br ] - I sure do . Two of them , below my penis . Listen . I 've gotta have sex right away . I 'm really , really horny . - I 'm getting that . [ br ] - Anderson ? Yes , sir ? I 've been waiting for you . Don Fisk . [ br ] Come on in . Good morning , Mr. Fisk . This way . - -as long as the contractionary [ br ] British fiscal policy continues . I can see we don 't need [ br ] any time to get acclimated . Pretty girl . That 's Rita , the office manager . [ br ] She 's mine . We go to Scottsdale every weekend . [ br ] I have a condo up there . You 're free to use it anytime . - Rita ? [ br ] - The condo . - Thanks . [ br ] - You know I have never seen such a stack [ br ] of glowing recommendations . If I didn 't know better , [ br ] I 'd think you wrote them yourself . A vice president 's job is opening up . [ br ] I assume you 're interested . No , not necessarily . Come on . It 's okay to be ambitious . [ br ] You 're only human . Well ... . Think it over . In the meantime ... - ... welcome aboard . [ br ] - Thanks . We got a wonderful family [ br ] of people here . Top-quality people . Except for Perry . [ br ] He 's a sneaky prick . Always looking for pussy , [ br ] never doing his job . - I can 't stand that . [ br ] - That is good to know . Neglected ? Nadine , how can you [ br ] feel neglected ? We never do anything ? What about that trip to New Orleans ? [ br ] Wasn 't that a good time ? I don 't care if it was four years ago . [ br ] I asked if it was a good time . Just don 't get all pissy , will you ? I can 't even ask you a question . [ br ] Could you hold ? Can you hold , please ? Thank you . Jones . No , that 's closed . [ br ] Pacific East flight 769 . Yeah , it was the hydraulics . Arizona West flight 442 . I was just [ br ] getting through that stuff . Hold on . I 'll have to call you back . [ br ] Let me call you back . What the hell ? You like ? This is [ br ] the best titty bar in Phoenix . How many are there ? This one , and there might be [ br ] one other , but it sucks . You come here a lot ? Once , twice a year . - Hi , Perry . [ br ] - Hey , Cheryl . - Grab me a beer . [ br ] - Sure . What would you like ? Someone just like you . Relative ? I 'm your cowboy , baby . Great , but that noise is [ br ] getting louder . Traffic . - Are you sure ? [ br ] - It 's rush hour . Come on . Make me feel like a man . Hold on , mister . [ br ] Time to put on your party clothes . What 's that ? A condom . My boss has one in Scottsdale . [ br ] He said I can use it . Great . Put it on . But I don 't want anything between us . Just unroll it . Oh , boy . What the hell was that ? It slipped . - Morning . [ br ] - Morning . How 'd it go with Cheryl ? I rushed her to the hospital . [ br ] She got some glass in her eye . Yeah , that happens . Where we going tonight ? I 'll take you to a great place . [ br ] I 'm taking you where I met Rita . I 'm Doreen . I 'm an alcoholic . Hi , Doreen . And today marks my 59th day [ br ] of sobriety . Thanks . Thank you very much . And I celebrated by [ br ] calling my parents to tell them about [ br ] my engagement to Janice . Dykes . Made popular on television , [ br ] now they 're everywhere . Is there anyone else [ br ] who 'd like to share ? You . Hello . Get the bread , [ br ] I see something tasty . Hi , this is the first time I 've [ br ] actually gotten up to speak , so I 'm- - Your name . Start with your name . Thanks . Of course . [ br ] I 'm sorry . I 'm Susan . Hi , Susan . Anyway , I 'm an alcoholic . I 've been sober [ br ] a couple of months now . Thanks . That 's okay . My father was an abusive alcoholic . And I guess maybe I 'm lucky [ br ] that he left when I was 7 . But my stepfather was an alcoholic . [ br ] And so was my second stepfather . Anyway , I have a history [ br ] of picking the wrong men . Big surprise , right ? The thing is , I never knew I had [ br ] a drinking problem because ever since high school , [ br ] I 've only dated musicians . They always said I was a lot of fun . - I like what I hear . [ br ] - But all that 's changed . I bottomed out . I was having fun in I don 't even remember what city . When I woke up , [ br ] I didn 't know where I was how I got there , [ br ] or who the guy was that I was with . And I thought I should know [ br ] at least one of those things . So I came here . I stopped putting myself in situations [ br ] where I couldn 't respect myself so others didn 't respect me . She wants respect . Cuts me out . Anyway , I took my first step today . I bought a new car and it 'll be great to get up in the [ br ] morning and remember where I parked it . Thanks . Would anyone else like to share ? It 's dead tonight . [ br ] Not a weeper in the joint . Weeper ? Usually one or two gals [ br ] get all weepy after the meeting . Then you clean up . You go over , [ br ] offer them a tissue . Bang , you 're in . Yank a nose hair right before you go . They see the tears , think you 're [ br ] a kindred spirit . You are in huge . Look . Wish me luck . What happened ? I did so much blow once , [ br ] I didn 't sleep for three weeks . I lost 1 5 pounds . The good thing ? [ br ] I 've been able to keep it off . Remember me from the aeroplane ? Oh , yeah , of course . [ br ] You hit me really hard . What are you doing here ? I have a slight problem . [ br ] You know how it is with airlines . You 're at 30,000 feet [ br ] with all those tiny bottles . - It 's really not my fault . [ br ] - Sure . Damn it ! You hit my car . My new car . - I don 't believe it . [ br ] - What happened ? Don 't get excited . First , [ br ] this isn 't new . This is a ' 98 . - I know a guy with one . [ br ] - It 's new to me ! Oh , God . Look at it . I guess we both have to drive [ br ] more carefully . I was parked , asshole . I don 't see a lot of damage , [ br ] so I 'm gonna run . Right , I got the cracked taillight , [ br ] dented fender package . I want to see your driver 's license , [ br ] registration and insurance . - Can 't we settle this without insurance ? [ br ] - No . If you try to worm your way [ br ] out of this I will cut your heart out [ br ] with my hood ornament . Have we dated ? I 'm not very good in bed . No , no . You 're great . No . My boyfriend once said it was [ br ] like trying to start a dead car . You 've got to uncross your legs . I told you I 'm not very good in bed . [ br ] I 'm sorry . What is that humming sound ? It 's the tendons in your legs [ br ] vibrating . Oh , you know what ? [ br ] Can you- - ? One second . Hello ? I was just thinking [ br ] about you too , Steve . We don 't want to lose our momentum . I miss you too . Is she there ? Ready for more ? I can 't do this . I 'm in love with a married pilot [ br ] from Dallas , our hub . You know who I feel really sorry for ? [ br ] His wife . - He 's off cheating on her . [ br ] - With you ? Get out ! What 'd I do ? I 'm crazy about you . - Get out ! [ br ] - You smell nice . I almost opened up to you . Are those your shoes ? [ br ] Those are beautiful shoes . You 're in a hurry . [ br ] Aren 't you gonna eat ? Gotta get to the office . - You mean you have to get to her . [ br ] - What ? - You 're having an affair . [ br ] - What 's wrong with you ? All you talk about is [ br ] how work bores you . Now you 're rushing to get to [ br ] your job ? What 's her name ? It 's not an affair . It 's that Pamela person . I 've seen the way she looks at you . [ br ] The woman is a slut . She 's in a wheelchair . Don 't think she doesn 't play that [ br ] for all it 's worth . You want to know what 's going on ? [ br ] You want to know the truth ? I deserve that much . This is classified , [ br ] so it 's just between you and me . A couple days ago , on an Arizona West [ br ] flight , there was an incident . The crew almost lost control . One of the passengers was [ br ] shooting video . Something made contact [ br ] with that plane . The thing is , [ br ] I don 't have an answer for it . For the first time in 22 years , [ br ] I don 't know what happened . There 's something about that . About the not knowing . Look . I 'm getting goose bumps [ br ] just thinking about it . It 's what I 've been waiting for . [ br ] Now it 's finally come . - Understand ? [ br ] - Does she have bigger tits than me ? I 'll figure this out . I 'll take that as a yes . I 'll be late . Damn ! Can I help you ? I 'm looking for Perry . You know Perry ? Yeah , but not too well . I 'm his wife . His wife ? Well , Perry 's a very lucky man , [ br ] if I may say . Very lucky . Harold Anderson . Helen . [ br ] He 's probably in the vault . Excuse me . [ br ] I 'm looking for Perry Gordon . Is it okay if I wait in his office ? - That 'll be fine . [ br ] - Thank you . Were you at the AA meeting [ br ] last night ? Yes . I saw you there . [ br ] Your speech was very good . Thanks . Do you work here ? Commercial and home loans . [ br ] Not too exciting . Just a normal guy . Nothing 's wrong with normal . [ br ] Do you know where Perry is ? You know Perry ? Well , no . [ br ] He backed into my car last night . I 've got an estimate . [ br ] Could you give this to him ? Sure . - You have beautiful handwriting . [ br ] - That 's the mechanic . This part here where you [ br ] signed your name ? Lovely . How long you been in the program ? - Program ? [ br ] - AA . I 'm not involved in the program . [ br ] Perry just took me there . He 's in the program ? Not that I know of . This would make [ br ] fantastic dinner conversation . - Busy tonight ? [ br ] - Why were you there ? Checking it out . Have you had [ br ] a chance to think about dinner ? Oh , God . I get it . You go to AA meetings to [ br ] pick up women . That 's sick . How can you take advantage of people ? Perry took me . I had no idea . [ br ] How 's 8 ? Excuse me . May I ? Here 's the estimate , okay ? I hope next time you take [ br ] a pathetic little jaunt to AA you drive more carefully . - What 's she talking about ? [ br ] - I 'm as confused as you are . Oh , come on . I just put everything I had [ br ] into this car . If you don 't want to go through your [ br ] insurance , write a check . I 'll wait . That 's where you were last night ? That 's what you didn 't want to tell me . [ br ] You were at an AA meeting ? Now you know . [ br ] I hope you 're happy . You 'll get your check . Why couldn 't you tell me ? I wasn 't sure I was strong enough to [ br ] stay committed to the program and I didn 't want to disappoint you [ br ] if I dropped out . Baby , I had no idea . It 's been tough , but , thank God , [ br ] so far so good . It 's a brave thing you 're doing . [ br ] I can 't believe it . One day at a time , sugar . I 'll walk you out . I love you so much . [ br ] I 'll do everything in my power to make sure you never take another [ br ] drink for the rest of your life . Thank you . That was his wife . He 's married and he 's going to [ br ] AA meetings to pick up women ? What a humongous sleazebag . [ br ] You married ? Nope . So I guess we 're on for dinner ? No . Nice meeting you . What planet are you from ? What do you mean ? You want to go out with me , I say no , [ br ] you 're like , okay , and that 's that . Put a little effort into it . You asking me out ? No , I 'm not asking you out . If I was [ br ] asking a man out , he 'd know it . Right . You know , I have a feeling [ br ] that you 're not what you appear to be . You smell nice . Thanks . Something new . [ br ] Just bought it today . God . Why was it never [ br ] this complicated before ? Because before , by now I 'd be drunk [ br ] and in bed with the guy . How 's 6 : 00 ? Damn it . Fine . Anything . 7 . 6 : 45 ? Fine . Tell me something about yourself . My name is Harold Anderson . [ br ] I work in a bank . And ? More ? I never met a man that talks less [ br ] about himself . Where were you born ? My turn to ask a question . [ br ] What do you do for a living ? I worked in a guitar shop [ br ] for a long time . When I got sober , [ br ] I realized I had to get out . Too many negative influences . Such as ? Well , musicians , for one . There was a sign over the door saying : [ br ] " Come in , pick up a guitar and play the beginning of ' Stairway [ br ] to Heaven ' as badly as you can . " I was close to going postal . So what are you doing now ? Well , don 't laugh , but I 'm working [ br ] as a real-estate agent . My friend has an office . [ br ] She helped me study for my license . So now I 'm out there [ br ] trying to sell houses . How 's it going ? I guess it 's okay . But I 'm six weeks into it and find out [ br ] you don 't get paid until you sell something , [ br ] which is like , " Oh , great . " So what is your mission ? - I 'm sorry ? [ br ] - Your mission in life . My mission is to [ br ] get to know myself so that I can end up focusing less [ br ] on myself and more on others . I think . I believe I was put here on Earth [ br ] to have a child . I 've never heard a man say that . I would love to have kids . [ br ] I just hope I 'm ready . We transfer our dysfunction [ br ] onto our kids . I don 't want to be guilty of that . [ br ] I 've already fucked up my dog . I want to have a child . [ br ] That 's all I want . What 's that noise ? Cheap sound system . I don 't trust you . Why ? All men are the same . They say whatever they have to , [ br ] to get into your pants . That 's terrible . [ br ] But what would it be ? What ? The thing I 'd have to say [ br ] to get into your pants ? It 's a little messy . How long you been working on it ? Just a couple of months , but I can [ br ] already tell I 'm never gonna stop . One day I 'm happy . The breakfast nook [ br ] should be yellow , bright and sunny . Next minute , I 'm down . [ br ] I repaint it blue . It was black a couple days ago . A black breakfast nook ? Doesn 't work . Trust me . Why don 't you take that arch thing [ br ] out altogether ? The whole thing ? I have a feeling that what 's out there [ br ] is more interesting anyway . What are these ? Part of this whole changing thing [ br ] that I 'm doing . I 'm supposed to turn myself over [ br ] to a higher power . My only problem is , [ br ] I 'm having trouble choosing one so I 'm just covering my ass . Higher power ? God , or whatever you want to call it . I 'm looking into each one until [ br ] I find one that connects with me . - How will you know ? [ br ] - I 'll just know . How ? Well , I 'll feel something , I guess . This one looks very old . Actually , it 's not old . [ br ] I got this on QVC . You don 't care about this . [ br ] You 're just tricking me . There 's no way to prove [ br ] that a God exists . - So ? [ br ] - So then why look ? - That 's not the point . [ br ] - Then what is the point ? Oh , God . I knew it . I knew this normal guy , [ br ] normal life thing had a big catch . Harold , please . Harold . [ br ] I have to stop . No , I can 't do this . Part of this whole thing [ br ] about me changing my life and living by a different set [ br ] of rules is- - You 'll laugh , but I decided [ br ] I won 't have sex until I 'm married . Sorry ? You see , I am finally free [ br ] not to have to have sex . Do you have any water ? Never mind . [ br ] I 'll help myself . Thanks for coming . Have you gotten a woman pregnant yet ? I 'm close , but there are variables [ br ] I 'm not prepared for . You 're close ? Yes . But she wants to get married . 3 billion females , and you pick [ br ] one that wants to get married . - Yes . [ br ] - That is bad luck . - What should I do ? [ br ] - Marry her . I 'm not trained for marriage . [ br ] Perry says it 's hell . - Who 's Perry ? [ br ] - This guy at work . He didn 't think Susan was hot . Who 's Susan ? Why is she hot ? [ br ] ls she on fire ? Susan is the woman . Earth probes are at Jupiter . In three [ br ] generations , they 'll know about us . Our takeover must be complete by then . Marry her , impregnate her , [ br ] and don 't call me again . The more we make contact , [ br ] the greater risk of discovery . Thanks a lot . Notice anything unusual [ br ] about the jolt that hit the plane ? Well , it wasn 't like anything [ br ] I 've ever experienced . Did you see anything fly by the [ br ] aircraft around the time of the jolt ? No , I was busy trying to keep things [ br ] calm in the cabin . A lot of panic ? You can imagine . Except for one jerk . He started hitting on me right after . [ br ] He acted like nothing even happened . Tell me about the guy that hit on you . Darn it . I knew I shouldn 't [ br ] have said anything . Okay , I went out with a passenger . [ br ] I 'm guilty . Excuse me ? We 're not supposed to date passengers , [ br ] but I met him after , at a function . We went to my place , [ br ] but nothing happened . So you first noticed him [ br ] after the jolt ? Yes , he was very obnoxious . What was he like before the jolt ? I don 't remember seeing him [ br ] before the jolt . Did you notice anything peculiar [ br ] or unusual about him ? Not really . Until we got to my place . [ br ] Then there was something odd . Go on . Again , nothing happened , [ br ] but while we were fooling around there was this strange humming sound [ br ] coming from his pants . From the front or the back ? The front . From the crotch area . Do you remember his name ? Harold Anderson . There was no Harold Anderson [ br ] on that flight . Oh , my God . We have a problem funding your loan . [ br ] We checked and it turns out there 's five frozen [ br ] yogurt places within a one-mile radius . - Hey , stranger . [ br ] - Hey , it 's you ! I 'm thinking about opening [ br ] an account here . Yeah , I don 't have a lot of money . [ br ] I have $ 7.35 . I 'd like to put some of it [ br ] into a T-bill , some into stocks and the rest I 'd just like to save [ br ] for a rainy day . Would you think about marrying me ? All right . I deserved that . I 'm serious . I thought about [ br ] what you said the other night . Everything I said was such a turnoff . I went completely overboard . [ br ] It was typical Susan . You know what ? There was some of that . Susan ... . [ br ] What is your last name ? Hart . Susan Hart would you do me the honour [ br ] of marrying me ? You 're serious . I want to marry you . I could court you [ br ] for six months or a year and we could get to know [ br ] each other , then break up or we could do something [ br ] that I think we both want now and that 's have a child . Wow ! And I just came in [ br ] to ask you to lunch . - You really mean this ? [ br ] - Yes . Can I think about it ? If you think you have to . This room will be perfect [ br ] for the baby . Oh , you have a baby . We 're having one in about six months . Congratulations . That 's wonderful . I 'm sure they 'll accept our offer . [ br ] You 'll be very happy here . Thanks . You 've been great . We 'll talk to you soon . - What ? [ br ] - Just fuck her right in front of me . You 're never getting pregnant again . [ br ] Never . It 's insanity . Come on . You 're off the booze . [ br ] You 're off the musicians and now you want to get married ? And to a man you barely know ? Don 't make me put together [ br ] an intervention . Thank you . This is Susan 's life . [ br ] It 's not our place to pass judgment . If she wants to get married and make [ br ] an idiot of herself , it 's her choice . - Is that the waiter ? [ br ] - No , that 's a gay guy without a jacket . - Why is marriage a bad choice ? [ br ] - Please ! She doesn 't even know the man . There 's something to be said for [ br ] jumping off the end of the diving board . Life is short . Until you marry the wrong guy . [ br ] Then it gets pretty long . I am almost dehydrated . What do you want to do , Susan ? I 'll tell you what she 's thinking : Being single is great . [ br ] But she goes onto the street or into people 's homes [ br ] and sees babies everywhere . They 're taking over . I thought that , then I 'd look [ br ] at those little shits and get angry because it looks like [ br ] they 're taunting you , saying : " Why don 't you have one of me yet ? [ br ] Why are you a loser ? " - You don 't like my baby ? [ br ] - Your baby 's adorable . When her head gets normal , [ br ] she 'll be gorgeous . - Her head is normal ! [ br ] - I 'm kidding ! I want to find out more about this guy . [ br ] Is he rich ? - You can 't ask that . [ br ] - Why not ? Because she doesn 't know , okay ? How can you have a child with a man [ br ] you don 't even know ? ! Excuse me . You were [ br ] artificially inseminated . Yes , I was , but I knew the technician [ br ] longer than she 's known this guy ! I 'm out of time . Do you have to go ? No I 'm running out of time . I think that would be great . [ br ] I 'm looking forward to it . Hold on . Someone 's on the other line . Hi , Harold . It 's me . Hey , me . Yes . The answer is yes . I will marry you . Hold on a second . Debbie , I won 't be able to go [ br ] rollerblading this weekend . I 'm getting married . Bye . I 'm back , Mrs. Anderson . I like the sound of that . Me too . - You don 't mind ? [ br ] - No . Is this everything ? This is all my work . If my clients [ br ] call , you have their information . - I didn 't even know you were doing her . [ br ] - I 'm not . You 're marrying a woman [ br ] you 've never had sex with ? Didn 't you see The Crying Game ? You think she 's got the goods , lift up [ br ] her skirt , it 's Oscar Mayer time . - Is this your third-quarter report ? [ br ] - Fisk won 't need this till I get back . - Damn it ! [ br ] - What ? Let 's go . What am I talking [ br ] about here ? I 'm such a downer . Imagine not banging your wife [ br ] until you 're married . How romantic . Everything will work out fine . Not that that 's ever happened . [ br ] I 'm kidding . Congratulations . - Thanks again for doing this . [ br ] - Go get her , tiger . I promise to respect you , even if [ br ] I don 't always understand you . I will honour you [ br ] and take care of you and though it 's not [ br ] politically correct I will obey you as long as [ br ] your request is reasonable . I will be mother to your children and love you until [ br ] death do us part . Very nice . - Harold . [ br ] - Present . No , your vows are next . This is where they all get nervous . Susan , I 'm so happy [ br ] we 're getting married . You know what they say . [ br ] Sometimes less is more . Harold and Susan , by the powers granted [ br ] to me by the state of Nevada I now pronounce you [ br ] husband and wife . You can kiss the bride . Stop . I never thought I 'd say this , [ br ] but I can 't take any more . - A few more times . [ br ] - No . - Where 'd you learn that ? [ br ] - What ? You 're amazing . I 've had so many orgasms , some are [ br ] still stacked up waiting to land . - Aren 't you tired ? [ br ] - Tired of waiting . Come on . Let 's get it on . Let 's talk . Okay . I still wish we 'd been married [ br ] in a church with a lot of people . I always dreamed of [ br ] a wedding like that . Me too . Stop . Stop . I thought we 'd take a helicopter trip [ br ] over Hoover Dam or something . - When we could be making love ? [ br ] - I need a break . We 've been screwing [ br ] for 21 hours nonstop . - We 've had room service . [ br ] - We did it while I ate . If I 'd known that 'd happen , [ br ] I wouldn 't have ordered soup . I heard this happens after you marry . [ br ] The woman loses interest in sex . I love sex with you but I want to do something [ br ] that involves , I don 't know , standing . Let 's do some goofy tourist thing . Like what ? So back to the room , then ? - Knock-knock . [ br ] - Perry . - I am very impressed with this work . [ br ] - Thank you . It looks like you 've done Anderson 's [ br ] work as well . This third-quarter report is brilliant . [ br ] I didn 't know you had it in you . Now you do , and I hope [ br ] you keep that in mind when you pick a new vice president [ br ] for this bank . I admit that Harold had [ br ] the inside track- - I don 't know if I trust Anderson . It 's strange , but what kind of guy [ br ] marries a chick after one date ? I smell some weird cult thing . I have no facts at all [ br ] to back that up but if they show up dead with [ br ] 40 friends , then we 'll know for sure . I 'm sure he 's not- - Not to tell tales , but he is lazy , [ br ] except for when you 're around . The rest of the time [ br ] he talks about his time in prison . - Wasn 't supposed to say that . [ br ] - I 'm back . Hey , buddy . [ br ] How was the honeymoon ? Good . Great . How was Vegas ? Never mind . [ br ] How many times you bang the wifey ? 1 26 . Come on , how many ? 1 26 . Why ? You serious ? 1 26 times in a week ? Harold , there 's a Mr. Roland Jones [ br ] here to see you . Excuse me . I thought you said he was lazy . - Hi . Harold Anderson . [ br ] - Roland Jones . - Have a seat . [ br ] - Thank you . I won 't take up much time . I 'm with [ br ] the Federal Aviation Authority . Don 't tell me [ br ] the government needs a loan . That 's another story . Maybe you can help me out here . You were on an Arizona West flight from [ br ] Seattle a few weeks ago , weren 't you ? I 'd have to check my day planner . [ br ] I do a lot of flying . Let me remind you of the flight . [ br ] The plane experienced severe turbulence . It frightened a lot of the passengers . I don 't remember it being scary . [ br ] I remember a small bump and then- - Was there something [ br ] mechanically wrong with the plane ? Do you still have your ticket ? I wish I did . [ br ] I throw all that stuff out . - You don 't save it for the records ? [ br ] - Don 't keep records . Don 't tell my boss . I could win a Pulitzer in fiction [ br ] for some of my expense reports . I won 't waste any more of your time . A little light reading . Have you seen [ br ] this month 's issue of Playboy ? Check out this month 's Playmate . Tell me if you think [ br ] those babies are real . I think those are real . Me too . I 'll be in touch . God ! Where are the pictures ? - Pictures ? [ br ] - Of the honeymoon . As a friend , you 're obligated [ br ] to bore me with your pictures . I don 't have any . You didn 't take pictures ? I took some , but I wanted to fill [ br ] the roll before I had it processed . You took less than [ br ] one roll of pictures ? What is that ? I guess she was kept busy [ br ] doing other things . You could say that . It was pretty great . I 'll bet , I 'll bet . There 's just one thing . Yes , there 's always " one thing . " I don 't know how serious this is [ br ] or if I should be worried , but ... . What ? How should I put this ? When he 's aroused , his penis vibrates . Hey , " two-two-two mints in one . " Wait . What do you mean , it vibrates ? " Vibrates " is not really the word . [ br ] It 's more like ... . - There 's a humming sound . [ br ] - Humming . I was with a black guy whose penis [ br ] whistled when he got excited . - Stop ! [ br ] - Yes ! I 'm not kidding ! What did it whistle ? The score from Guys and Dolls . [ br ] It just whistled . - You would ask that . [ br ] - I thought I was making tea . I love it . I love it . Hi , honey ! You 're home . You remember the girls . Yes . Hello . Showtime . I guess you don 't like my friends . Why do you say that ? You barely acknowledged them . [ br ] What 's the problem ? I don 't know . They 're your friends . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I had a bad day at work . You want to talk about it ? No . Have you taken the pregnancy test ? No , but I will in a few days . You 're [ br ] not looking at me when I talk to you . You 're looking at me , [ br ] but you 're not really looking . I 'm looking right at you [ br ] and listening , I swear . Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's probably not you . [ br ] It 's probably me . Can we just try [ br ] to have a conversation ? Oh , Christ ! Turn that thing off . You should pee on it again . - You pee on it . I 'm done . [ br ] - I just want to know for sure . I feel like I 'd be worth nothing [ br ] to you if I couldn 't conceive . What if I can 't have a baby ? [ br ] Did you think about that ? I led a pretty wild life . All that sex [ br ] and drinking . Maybe I can 't conceive . - How much sex and drinking ? [ br ] - That 's not the point . You brought it up . [ br ] How would we know for sure ? I don 't know . [ br ] I 'd have to have an exam . Then let 's call [ br ] and schedule something . I have to talk to you . - What ? [ br ] - Nothing . You said you wanted to talk . I changed my mind . What are you thinking ? - Who ? [ br ] - You . What are you thinking right now ? I don 't remember . It 's not like the world will stop [ br ] spinning if I can 't have a child . There 's such a thing as adoption . That 's a viable alternative . What are you thinking now ? That you 're telling me [ br ] you can 't have a baby . Is that all you 're thinking ? Let me think . Yeah . I want to have a child . I 'm as into having a child as you are . I 'm getting this vibe from you , [ br ] this vibe that says I 'm holding out on you , [ br ] or I don 't want it as much as you do . Whether I can have a child [ br ] or if I can 't there has to be more [ br ] to this relationship . Like maybe some communication . And a little feeling , [ br ] which is not what I 'm getting . I suggest you start opening up [ br ] and stop pressuring me about the baby . Because at this point , I 'm ready to buy [ br ] a baby and shove it up your ass . This might be a good time to sit next to me [ br ] and try to comfort me . You might want to consider [ br ] putting your arm around me . Maybe you should try [ br ] to put some feeling into it . Not that kind of feeling ! Jesus , Harold ! At times like this , [ br ] I feel like I don 't know you . You don 't . Maybe that 's why [ br ] you 're having that feeling . What ? You don 't really know me . You don 't . I don 't know what to say . Why don 't you try talking to me [ br ] like a human being ? I have to take a little walk . [ br ] I 'll be right back . Why are you drinking ? When we met , she liked that [ br ] I didn 't talk about myself . Now she wants to know [ br ] everything I 'm thinking ! - Who ? [ br ] - Susan ! It 's a living hell ! Perry at work turned in [ br ] my third-quarter report and claimed the work was his . [ br ] What if he gets that promotion ? I 'm this close to taking off [ br ] the penis and coming home ! You will not . Your penis [ br ] is staying right where it is . - How 's it working ? [ br ] - It 's a major pain in the ass . - They installed it too far back ? [ br ] - No , it hums . We 'll work on it . [ br ] You 're here to make adjustments . She thinks she might not [ br ] be able to have a baby . What will I do if she can 't ? I 've got 4 million men [ br ] waiting for you to succeed . If this woman can 't have a baby , [ br ] find one who can . All right , I 'll cheat on my wife . I don 't know what that means . [ br ] I want you to complete your mission . Fine . I 'll get someone else pregnant . Stop drinking . And I 'll get on your penis right away . Could you say that a little louder ? Just put it in triplicate , [ br ] give it to- - Wait , hang on . Hang on ! Hello ? Randy , just talk . I can hear you . Arizona West 771 ? The same kind of jolt ? How many jolts were there ? Listen to me ! [ br ] Do you have a passenger list there ? Is there a Harold Anderson onboard ? There is ? What a coincidence . I 'm an alien from another planet . Really ? Yeah . Somewhere [ br ] way the hell out there . How come you don 't have a head [ br ] like a pear with the big eyes ? You know , there 's a lot of aliens . [ br ] We 're not the only ones . Those big-head guys scare me . [ br ] I wouldn 't want to bump into one . I hear they perform anal probes . [ br ] How primitive is that technology ? " We came 6 trillion miles [ br ] to study your ass . We 're proctologists from space . " Could I have another one here ? What 's it all about ? Yeah , go ahead and rest . Hey , Helen . - Harold . [ br ] - Hey ! Helen , right ? Yeah . Who 's your friend ? My personal shopper . Unfortunately , [ br ] she only knows how to buy booze . I think I 'll bum one of her [ br ] cigarettes . Think she 'll miss it ? I don 't think she 'd miss a limb . Light me . Thanks . So how 's work ? Bank stuff . Nothing exciting . Nothing exciting ? [ br ] I wouldn 't say that . I 've loved numbers and math [ br ] ever since I was a little girl . I find it fascinating . You get to deal with [ br ] all that money all day . Just thinking about it makes me hot . You 're making a noise . That 's my penis . It hums . Guess it doesn 't know the words . I could teach it a few . - What 's the matter ? [ br ] - Nothing . Damn it ! Goddamn it , come on ! Damn it ! I 'm sorry . I can 't do this . I can do whatever you need . [ br ] What do you need ? I need to go home . To your wife ? Don 't tell me you feel guilty . Guilty ? Just when you 're found [ br ] With your chin on the ground There 's a lot to be learned So look around Just what makes that little old ant Think he 'll move that rubber tree plant Anyone knows an ant Can 't move a rubber tree plant But he 's got high hopes He 's got high hopes He 's got high apple pie In the sky hopes Congratulations , Dad ! We 're pregnant ! I don 't believe it . I did it ! I helped . Now you can 't leave me . - Morning , Melanie . [ br ] - Morning . - Jessie , how are the kids ? [ br ] - Great . Dave , I can tell from the look [ br ] on your face you got some last night . Good man . Morning , Harold . I heard [ br ] the good news . Congratulations . Thank you . I 've thought about that promotion . [ br ] I hope you haven 't made up your mind . It 's between you and Perry . His [ br ] third-quarter report was a knockout . - You seen Perry ? [ br ] - He 's in the vault . - Thank you . [ br ] - You 're welcome . So you see the balance of power [ br ] changing in the Middle East . It has to , because a high percentage [ br ] of Israelis practice birth control whereas a high percentage [ br ] of people in Arab nations do not . I 've heard this theory , but it [ br ] sounds a bit crazy , even paranoid . Your interpretation of it [ br ] might be paranoid but the fact is , [ br ] Arabs are having more children . In a couple of generations they 'll be able to control the [ br ] voting in Israel , hence , take over . So they 're getting control [ br ] from within ? That 's the idea . I think I got it . [ br ] I think I know why he 's here . What are you doing ? - I 'm leaving . [ br ] - You 're leaving ? I found this in your bottom drawer [ br ] under your winter pants . That 's not for your eyes . Why do you have a picture of [ br ] a naked man touching himself in your winter pants drawer ? It 's not a man . That 's the alien . Oh , the alien . The alienlbanker . I don 't know what I 'll do [ br ] if you tell me you 're gay . I 'm not gay . I 'm tracking an alien . [ br ] He 's here to have sex with our women . His penis hums . It sounds like that heater [ br ] in our timeshare at Deer Valley . I 'm not making this up ! [ br ] I 'll prove everything ! Oh , my God . You 've done it again ! It 's always like this . [ br ] You get obsessed with things . Anything to avoid intimacy ! You lost your first wife to golf , [ br ] your second because of other women ! You were one of them . Golf I can understand . [ br ] Women I can understand . But this ? [ br ] Aliens having sex with people ? How does that make me feel ? Tell me you 're having an affair with a [ br ] beautiful stripper instead of a man so I can at least [ br ] look at myself in the mirror ! Baby , I swear I 'm not . This is not what I want my life to be . I think Helen 's having an affair . What makes you think that ? I found a belt in my bedroom [ br ] that wasn 't mine . - Sure it 's not yours ? [ br ] - Positive . It was Armani . Only queers wear Armani . [ br ] I think he did her in the shower . - The curtain was ripped . [ br ] - Maybe she slipped . Fisk walked into the vault yesterday . Two seconds earlier , [ br ] he would 've caught me and Rita . Did you tell Fisk I was in the vault ? - You fucking my wife ? [ br ] - No . And no ! You sure ? Why would I do that ? To get even [ br ] with you for giving Fisk my report ? Where does that come from ? What did I do to deserve that other than extend [ br ] the hand of friendship ? - After everything I 've done for you ? [ br ] - What have you done for me ? What have I done ? [ br ] What have I done for you ? Did I not take you to the place [ br ] where you met your wife ? - Sorry . [ br ] - It 's okay . Sorry . Jeez , just try to relax ! [ br ] You are wound as tight as a drum ! Do us both a favour , okay ? I 'll be in the vault . [ br ] If you see Fisk , cover for me . Asshole . Not you , sir . They try the reverse to Specca . Has some running room . Cuts it back inside , [ br ] but the pursuit will catch up . That 's Tim Schaefer , the cornerback , [ br ] chasing him out of bounds . Hi . Hi , Dad . Hi . - You want to go fool around ? [ br ] - Fourth quarter . Is there something wrong ? No . Why ? I hope I 'm not going to say this . I am . You 're more distant since I got [ br ] pregnant . Or is it my hormones ? - I think it 's your hormones . [ br ] - I don 't think so . - What are you talking about ? [ br ] - You haven 't touched me in weeks . - Turning that off ? [ br ] - I 'm turning the sound up . Let me . Maybe I haven 't touched you as much but that 's no reason [ br ] to destroy the remote . Come on . Where are you going ? To buy a new remote , [ br ] or we 'll have to keep getting up . Excuse me . We have plans . [ br ] Or have you forgotten ? - We have plans ? [ br ] - Yes . I was thinking about [ br ] looking at cribs for the baby . - You didn 't tell me that . [ br ] - I 'm telling you now . Don 't let me hold you up . [ br ] Go get your precious remote . We won 't worry about the crib . The baby can sleep in a drawer for [ br ] the first year of its life . Just go . - What are you doing ? [ br ] - You said go . Bye . It 's a universal remote . It comes with codes [ br ] for every TV and VCR . You punch in the code for your [ br ] equipment and you 're in business . - Yes . Modern technology . [ br ] - You said it . - What do you think of " Aaron " ? [ br ] - Who 's Aaron ? No , for the baby if it 's a boy . You said you were six weeks pregnant ? Something wrong ? Who are you calling ? Tom , could you come in here ? I 'm sure it 's nothing to be [ br ] alarmed about . Have you had pain or any other [ br ] out-of-the-ordinary symptoms ? No , not a single problem . [ br ] Not even morning sickness . Look at this . Looks like a perfectly formed [ br ] 5-month-old fetus . She 's at six weeks . I 'm scared . He said it was healthy . [ br ] That 's the important thing . - Did you see rosemary 's Baby ? [ br ] - Rosemary who ? - No , it 's- - [ br ] - You need to rest . Just sit down . - Thanks . [ br ] - No problem . Easy . Easy . - Thanks . [ br ] - There you go . Don 't . Thank you all so much . - Congratulations . [ br ] - Thank you , Hank . Hey , Anderson ! You 're late . It 's 1 1 : 00 . I 'll let it slide , as it 's [ br ] my first day as vice president . - You got the promotion ? [ br ] - And you didn 't . There 's always five years from now . [ br ] Champagne ? Harold , don 't take it so hard . - Do I smell tears ? [ br ] - What is your fucking problem ? You stole my report . You have sex with a coworker [ br ] during office hours . You got the promotion , [ br ] which means you 're blowing the boss . I 've met some pathetic humans [ br ] in my life , but you take the cake ! Like you 're better . I knew it was you [ br ] who sent Fisk to the vault . The Armani belt was yours , you prick ! You wouldn 't bang other people 's wives [ br ] if your old lady wasn 't a drunk ! You 're crazy ! I don 't remember hitting him . He was talking , and I was feeling [ br ] l-don 't-know-what because he got the promotion [ br ] and he stole my work . He 'll make more money than me , [ br ] and we have a baby on the way . I hit him . [ br ] I don 't know who I am anymore . You 're being too hard on yourself . [ br ] You 're just human , that 's all . Shit , I 'm bleeding . No , you 're not . You 're crying . - I love the way you look at the stars . [ br ] - I was just looking . No , there 's something different . When most people look , [ br ] they look all over . You 're always focused , like you [ br ] look at the same one every time . I feel so much better [ br ] when I 'm with you . That 's the nicest thing [ br ] you 've ever said to me . I didn 't say it to be nice . [ br ] It 's just a fact . That 's even nicer , I guess . I 'm sorry about that whole thing [ br ] with the remote . That 's okay . Are you gonna make love to me ? I believe so . I 'm pregnant . I know . - I don 't know what the problem is . [ br ] - You have a problem listening to me . - Stop being so stubborn . [ br ] - I 'm not stubborn . - Why are you here ? [ br ] - Let 's buy this house . - What ? [ br ] - Why not ? It 's a beautiful house . [ br ] It 's perfect for the baby . - You can 't be serious . [ br ] - I am . I 'm dead serious . We won 't need this anymore . - I don 't believe this ! [ br ] - Let 's take a look . This is going to be so great . Look , our cactus . - I couldn 't even imagine this ! [ br ] - I don 't either . Universal domination . Taking over from the inside [ br ] through deception and fraud . I believe in what [ br ] I 'm saying 1 1 0 percent . So this person is here to have sex . Correct . Did they run out of pussy [ br ] on his planet ? It sounds insane , but I have [ br ] passenger lists of all flights that experienced [ br ] the same turbulence . Harold Anderson was [ br ] on all these flights . Explain that , and you won 't hear [ br ] any more from me about this subject . It 's too small . Try raising [ br ] your hands over your head . How often do you raise your hands [ br ] higher than this ? - It 's perfect . [ br ] - No , I 'll exchange it . Your turn . I got you a present . Open it . All right . The crib ! This is the one I wanted . This one 's for the baby , but maybe [ br ] you can both squeeze into it . Oh , God . What 's wrong ? I 'm being ripped apart ! It 's okay . Hang on . Stop driving so fast . - I thought you wanted me to hurry . [ br ] - I do , but slow down ! God ! - Is this pain normal ? [ br ] - Yes . This pain is normal . [ br ] That 's a good sign . Shut up , asshole ! She 's fine . - They 're not home . [ br ] - The Andersons ? They 're at the hospital [ br ] having their baby . I love babies . Shit . Which hospital ? She told me a couple of weeks ago . - It 's a woman 's name . [ br ] - Think . St. Agnes ! No , wait . That 's my name . It was St. Agatha 's . Come on . Give us another push , Susan . Why are so many people here ? Considering the unusual nature [ br ] of your pregnancy I thought we should have [ br ] specialists on hand . - Should that make me feel better ? [ br ] - BP 's dropping . We 'll have to do a C-section . - God help me . [ br ] - Hold it ! I see the head . Keep pushing , Susan . [ br ] Give me some pushes . Please . Please . - What 's happening ? [ br ] - One second . All right , suction here , please . - Oh , God , I can 't hear my baby . [ br ] - I can 't see anything . This is the strangest , [ br ] most incredible ... . Mr. and Mrs. Anderson say hello to your completely [ br ] healthy , new baby boy . Don 't tell anyone about [ br ] this three-month pregnancy . Everyone will want one . You okay ? We had him . We made this . [ br ] This is us ! It 's a miracle . I can 't wait to see him again . You were so cute in the delivery room . I 'll always remember your face [ br ] when they handed him to you . I want you to remember that . What 's wrong ? Harold , what is it ? I have to leave . Leave the hospital ? Yeah . When will you be back ? I 'm not coming back . What ? I don 't want to go . I have to . You 're not coming back ? No . Maybe I should 've just left . This seems worse . - Can I help you ? [ br ] - Harold Anderson ? His wife is having a baby . They 're in the maternity wing , [ br ] in the delivery room . You can 't go in there , sir ! [ br ] Sir , you are not allowed in there ! Get out . Get the hell away from me . I don 't believe it . I did it again ! I did it again ! I know you 're angry . You coward ! Two minutes with [ br ] your child and you 're scared shitless . Get him out ! Get him out of here ! Get out ! Get out ! - I need to talk to Harold Anderson . [ br ] - Is he in the military ? - Where is he ? [ br ] - Wife 's here . He 's gone . - Can I talk to her ? [ br ] - Not a good time . If you find him , [ br ] give him a kick in the pants . Soon as the baby 's born , [ br ] he leaves his wife . What kind of person is that ? He 's going back . [ br ] I know where he is . Excuse me , chief . Merry Christmas . I 'm looking for a passenger . [ br ] Harold Anderson , usual spelling . We 're just about to push away . So they gave her a C-section . Dr. Weitzman , we 've got a problem . - What is it ? [ br ] - It 's about the Anderson baby . The captain has turned off [ br ] the " fasten seat belt " sign . For your safety and the safety [ br ] of those around you we suggest you remain seated [ br ] with your seat belt fastened . Thank you and enjoy your flight . Excuse me . I need to get by . Why is it you pack what you need [ br ] where you can 't get it ? Why are the aisles so narrow ? Do I look like fucking Andy Rooney ? [ br ] Get out of the way ! Excuse me . Watch your back . Coming through . Watch your back . [ br ] Excuse me . Coming through . No , no , I 'm okay . [ br ] I don 't need anything . Just a mild sedative . It 'll help keep you calm [ br ] while you recuperate . I know you 've had some bad news , and [ br ] believe me , I hate to give you more . We believe that your husband [ br ] has taken the baby . We 've contacted the authorities . I 'm fired ? - You 're just taking your sabbatical . [ br ] - That will bring you to retirement . So I 'm fired . No , you 're taking a sabbatical , [ br ] and then you 're retiring . I saw him walk into the lavatory . [ br ] When I opened the door , he was gone . Are you aware of what you 're saying ? Just enjoy your time off . Rest . Bastard . Bastard ! I have to go buy [ br ] a remote control for the TV set . Don 't let me stop you . [ br ] Have a wonderful time . I want to shop for baby clothes , [ br ] but we won 't worry about that . The baby can go naked [ br ] the first year of its life . Go . Go . So I go ? No , you don 't go . [ br ] See , that 's the interesting thing . But she told me to go . There 's a whole layer here [ br ] you 're missing . Now you know what I had to deal with . [ br ] Take your seat . This isn 't easy , [ br ] so don 't beat yourself up over it . What does that mean ? Just sit down . I 've reprogrammed the computer [ br ] to more accurately represent what you 'll deal with on Earth . If you look for an overriding [ br ] logic or rationality remember it 's Earth [ br ] we 're dealing with . - I guess you don 't like my friends . [ br ] - I like them . You barely acknowledged them . [ br ] What 's wrong with you ? If you don 't talk , [ br ] how will I know what 's wrong ? You gotta open up . [ br ] You gotta communica- - I guess you don 't like my friends . You barely acknowledged them . [ br ] What 's wrong with you ? If you don 't talk , [ br ] how will I know what 's wrong ? I mean , you 've gotta com- - It goes on and on like that for hours . Human relationships are filled [ br ] with conflict . The whole planet is filled with [ br ] conflict , which isn 't a bad thing . Through conflict [ br ] we learn about ourselves . I don 't understand this . Questions ? I see some confused faces . You see on our planet , [ br ] we have no emotion or conflicts so we 've never had [ br ] to look inward at ourselves . That helped us become a technological , [ br ] intellectual force in the universe but I really think it 's a dead end . To be honest with you , I question [ br ] why we 're taking over Earth . Why make them like us , when [ br ] in fact we can learn from them ? And they can remind us [ br ] of who we were before- - Excuse me . Why does Graydon want to see me ? If you don 't talk to me , [ br ] I won 't know what 's wrong . Hey , my baby ! That 's my baby . Wait a minute . [ br ] What 's my baby doing here ? Stop . Wait a minute . Stop ! You can 't pollute the others . - Why 's my son here ? [ br ] - You 're raising your voice . You bet I am . [ br ] You never told me you 'd take the baby . Did you tell anyone who you were [ br ] and why you were there ? - A woman in a bar . [ br ] - We took care of her . Anyone else ? [ br ] Anyone you told will be disposed of . Why are we taking over Earth ? [ br ] How much do we need ? Is that what it 's about ? More ? I 'm sending you [ br ] to the purification centre . Take him . I don 't want him to [ br ] remember his time there or the baby . Get out of my way ! Get back ! Put your weapons down . Put your weapons down . [ br ] You 're scaring the baby . See ? See what you did ? I told you [ br ] you were scaring the baby . Turn that thing off ! Turn it off ? You 're the one who [ br ] got it started . You turn it off . Turn it off . This thing will blow . [ br ] That 's what they do . This is how it starts . It gets worse [ br ] and worse , and then they explode . There 'll be baby all over the place . That 's my boy . Thank you . Thank you so much . Just please let me know [ br ] as soon as you hear anything . Somebody spotted a man in Michigan . Matches Harold 's description , [ br ] and he was carrying a baby . Hi . Hi , Liz . Alison . - He 's fine . [ br ] - You bastard ! He 's fine . Oh , God . Do you have any idea what I 've been through [ br ] in the last two days ? Any clue ? I 'm sure it 's been awful . [ br ] That 's why I brought him back . How could you take him ? [ br ] How could you do this ? - How , Harold ? [ br ] - I didn 't . - Then who did ? [ br ] - Not me . Why would I expect you to tell [ br ] the truth at this point ? How sick am I ? Would you take him ? I 'll be right there . I have to know [ br ] how you could do this to me . - How , Harold ? [ br ] - I 'll tell you the truth . - All right . [ br ] - I will . I can wait . Go ahead . I 'm an alien from another planet . I was sent here to impregnate [ br ] a woman , then go back . Graydon , the leader , came [ br ] and took the baby without telling me . So I stole the baby back . And now I 'm here . [ br ] Is there any way we can start over ? Is there a history of [ br ] mental illness in your family ? I care about you . - Our son should be with his mother . [ br ] - This is my son . This is my son . This is not our son . There 's no " us " anymore , [ br ] so there can 't be any " our . " I 'm calling the police now . - I can prove I 'm an alien . [ br ] - Really ? I can make a bright light [ br ] come out of my nose . That must be handy when [ br ] you can 't find a flashlight . I can show you . Or you can take [ br ] my word for it and trust me . Trust you ? Trust you ? [ br ] I should trust a man that- - I thought I did [ br ] everything right this time . But no , I married an alien [ br ] from another planet . I could never give you [ br ] what you want . I 'm not human . I could never understand what love is . I hope , as time goes by , [ br ] you 'll be able to forgive me . Goodbye . Well , well , well , I was right . [ br ] I wasn 't crazy . I was right . Congratulations . - My wife didn 't believe me . [ br ] - Mine didn 't believe me either . Don 't get me started . What will you do now ? Take me in ? To where ? My bosses fired me . I could give a rat 's ass about them . I had to know the truth for me . [ br ] As a man . I hear you . What was the plan ? [ br ] World domination , right ? - Isn 't it always ? [ br ] - Tell me about it . I 'm really in Dutch with the wife [ br ] about this whole deal . If you show her that nose-light thing , [ br ] it 'd get me out of the doghouse . - My pleasure . [ br ] - Great . Let 's go . No one 's going anywhere . - Who 's this guy ? [ br ] - This is the leader of my planet . No shit . You 've placed us in a very [ br ] difficult position . Come with me . I don 't know what [ br ] your thing is with him but he 's gotta go [ br ] see my wife first , okay ? You appear intelligent , but when you [ br ] open your mouth , the effect is spoiled . You might want to drop that . Fool . I have a highly evolved brain [ br ] that can block intense pain and also heal any injury [ br ] within a matter of seconds . You cannot hurt me . I had a feeling that heal-any-injury [ br ] thing was bullshit . - Who 's that ? [ br ] - Graydon , the leader of my planet . - Is he dead ? [ br ] - Yeah . He just killed him . I have to talk to you about something . I should probably run along . I was just wondering if [ br ] it 'd be okay if , you know ... . Can I have him ? I don 't see why not . Excuse me . Great . Nice meeting both of you . [ br ] Take care . To be clear , this really was [ br ] the leader of your planet , right ? If it 's your insurance agent , [ br ] I 'm in deep shit . You 're okay , man . Thanks . I got an alien , I got an alien ! You know what you said [ br ] about not knowing what love is ? Well , I don 't know either . Really ? No , but you married me . [ br ] We had a child . You rescued him [ br ] and brought him back to me and then told me the truth [ br ] about who you really are . Maybe that 's your way [ br ] of saying you love me ? I don 't know . Me too . Let us celebrate [ br ] with Susan and Harold as they renew their marriage vows . Let this also be a time for [ br ] the rest of us to reflect upon and make a renewed spiritual [ br ] commitment to our own vows and unions . Harold and Susan have written [ br ] their own vows . Harold , would you like to start ? Susan , when I married you the first [ br ] time , I did it to get into your pants . Now I 'm doing it because I want to [ br ] spend my life getting into your pants . Thank you for marrying me . And I will do everything possible [ br ] to make you and our new son ... Aaron . ... Aaron , very happy . - That was beautiful . [ br ] - Thank you . And now you , Susan . Harold , meeting you taught me the [ br ] universe is one screwed-up place where everyone 's trying [ br ] to work out their problems . But I 'm honoured to work them out [ br ] with you , because I think I love you . Very cosmic . And with that , I again [ br ] pronounce you man and wife . You may now kiss . That was great . - That was the wedding I always wanted . [ br ] - I know . What a perfect day . Your friends seem nice . I didn 't want to bring this up [ br ] until after the ceremony but they want me [ br ] to be leader of the planet . - You 're kidding . [ br ] - No . - What did you say ? [ br ] - I told them I had to talk to you . That 's quite an honour . [ br ] I 'm proud of you . Thanks . But it means [ br ] we 'd have to move there . I could commute , [ br ] but that 's a long commute . All my friends are here . Who ? Liz and Alison [ br ] and what 's-her-name ? - Why do you have to do that ? [ br ] - Sorry . I know nothing about your planet . I [ br ] don 't know what the schools are like . We 're 1 000 years ahead . [ br ] What do you think they 're like ? You 're going too fast for the baby . Don 't start . The baby was fine [ br ] in the transporter chamber . Four solar systems , [ br ] I never heard a peep . Okay , I 'll commute .

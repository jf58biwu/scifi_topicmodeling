 ... You pull , into the roll . It 's counter - intuitive at first , but it radically increases your distance from the enemy . Aeryn , my module is a research craft , it 's not built for hairpin maneuvers . Would you like ... to learn how to do this , or are you content to continually display your ineptitude ? My ineptitude ? You mean my improvisation that kind of balls your sorry military ... I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . What is that smell ? W - what ? It 's your hair . It smells . Zhaan gave me something . Alright . Smells good . I like it . Well it 's not for you to like . Oh . Then what 's it for ? For me to like . You don 't like that ... I like it ? Personal indulgences can fracture a small crew . Then I will never tell them ... that you scented your hair . No ! What ? Aeryn ! - Aeryn , stop ! - No ! No ! - Aeryn , wait ! - I will not be a slave to your hormones ! My hormones ? Hey , I was lips , you were tongue ! Why did you do your hair ? Huh ? To see if you 'd notice . Standing at ... attention . Well then I 'll let Zhaan know you find her oils pleasing . It 's you that I find pleasing ! You want some advice ? Not particularly . Makes me want to give it to you , even more . There 's too much pressure . She 's scared of the future . So why not just live in the moment ? You come up with that yourself ? Go fast with the body , slow with the soul . Maybe you should find someone like that . Commander Crichton . Chiana . Please join the others in the command , at once . Okay , Pilot , they 're here . Now tell us . Why have we stopped moving ? Are you familiar with automated Peacekeeper satellite weaponry ? Self - tracking pulse cannons . We are locked in a cross - targeted helix . Pilot , give us immediate starburst . Impossible . The initiation of an energy surge will result in our destruction . Is it Scorpius ? Do you think they 've found us ? There are no vessels anywhere near . Then how the frell did they get here ? Perhaps from the inhabited star systems on Moya 's sense horizon . These cannons appear to be their first line of defense . Peacekeeper settlements this far into the Uncharted Territories ? Goddess help us . We gotta do something . Something useful ! A ... representative of the inhabited system ... has been signaling us . By the yotz ! Run , fight , surrender ! Pick one ! Moya chooses ... surrender . Resistance by her means ... death . My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . I am ... oh no , Rygel Oh , no , no , no , no way Jose . You keep your mouth shut . But I am our best negotiator . Our best self - serving to - hell - with - everyone - else - lator . Y - you just shut up . Our scan reveals you do indeed have no large weaponry or hidden cargo . Yes . And despite this ship 's Peacekeeper history , we are in no way affiliated with them . We are , as stated , Counselor Tyno , peaceful . And as such , we now release you to travel as you will . You 're not gonna shoot ? Well . That was a productive four arns . May we approach your worlds ? We are prepared to pay for provisions . I 'm afraid that 's impossible , during coronation time . Coronation time ? I am Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth , of the Hynerian Empire . Would you turn away royalty bearing gifts for your new sovereign ? Escaped prisoners , bearing gifts ? Hear me Counselor Tyno . Your hatred of the Peacekeepers can never approach ours . Fate has conspired to forge this alliance . The royal planet will receive you . Understand , as festivities approach , we are under strict security . Weapons of any kind will result in incarceration . Was I right ? Yeah , I guess so . Was I right ? Yes , Rygel , you were right . Don 't ... ever ... forget it . Aeryn , I wanna talk . I wanna talk less ! We tried that , it leads to kissing . oh That 's a joke . It 's to relieve the tension . It wasn 't funny . Just give me some space , John . Fine . Have the whole Universe . Chiana ! Yeah . Yeah , I 'm going down to the planet , you wanna hang ? Yeah . That 's good . Cool , can I come in ? Oh , oh jeez ! Whoa - ho - ho ! Bad time ! G - good time , sorry , uh , wrong time ! John , my life has been one crushing disappointment after the next . But with this girl , I have managed to find moments of pleasure . Don 't ... blow it for me . Never . It 's cool . I 'm happy for you . Good . - Good . - Good . How come I 'm always the last to know ? So these are the fabled break away colonies . When they declared independence and fled from our home systems , no one gave them a chance of surviving . And yet here they are , still hating the Peacekeepers , nineteen hundred cycles later . And every Peacekeeper attempt since then to forge coalition has failed . I 'd say they enjoy their freedoms far too much , Aeryn . Yeah . And why not ? Buy you a drink for a few words . You mean now that Chiana 's occupied ? You made a run at Zhaan yet ? Oh , that is unfair ! Hi ! Hi . Oh no - no - no - no , I ... I stopped raving years ago . It doesn 't hurt you . It 's just for the kiss . There 's no taste kinda like an old ... Sorry . It 's great , you know . It 's a whole world designed for your rutting instincts . No ! No - no - no - no - no . Try him , he seems to love kissing . Oh no . No . I am never leavin ' this world . Hey . Clayvor my sweet , there 's a Sebacean down here your sister hasn 't kissed yet . You said the boarders were closed ! No new visitors . And you said that it wouldn 't matter , that my sister couldn 't ever assume the throne , no matter how many suitors they bring in . Her chemical compatibility is irrevocably altered . You will be king . Is this Crichton intelligent ? Surprisingly , despite his appearance . I find it strange , Counselor Tyno , that your in coronation time and have yet to identify your crown successor . As first born , it was always intended for Princess Katralla . But by law , unless she can find a compatible mate ... the kingdom will fall to her younger brother . She 's a slave to her mother , I 'm the only one that recognizes the Scarran Imperium . Even if you are the best they could send . Now , now you two . Well , if you 're not going to be king , Clayvor ... I 'm not going to marry you . Excuse me , Zhaan . Why didn 't you visit the royal planet with the others ? My solitude is so important to me , Pilot . I barely have enough time to pursue the tannents of my priesthood as it is . Being presumptuous , I have opened all the doors on the chamber on this tier . Moya and I are ... pleased you have once again chosen to stay with us . Two drops from these little vials ... and we can tell if our ... if our DNA is compatible for children . Oh , no , no . I don 't ... wanna do that . Come on , what 've we got to lose ? I don 't wanna . Our innocence , that 's what we 've got to lose . I - it 's just a game for us , D 'argo . Okay ? We don 't play by the rules they do . The truth is , we 're not compatible . Well , only our DNA . Not the parts that make us feel pleasure . Why is he watching us so intently ? When 's the last time you saw a Scarran on a diplomatic mission ? What do you think he wants ? Besides killing Peacekeepers , I mean . The same thing my superiors wanted ... a covenant with this kingdom . Go away . Go ! Have you lost your mind ? Do it . Sweet ! I 'm so pleased ! Me too ! How unexpected ! I wish you both the very best of ... fortune . Thank you ! Zhaan . Zhaan ! Pilot , are you calling me ? It 's Scorpius ! Scorpius has found us ! Is the Command Carrier any closer , Pilot ? Still held in obeyance at the satellite cannon perimeter . Have they spotted our orbit , yet ? Confirmed . Moya senses the Peacekeeper scan . Have we got time to retrieve Crichton and the others ? No . What if we let them see us , and then ... . Starburst . Scorpius may think we 're all aboard and pursue ... Goddess please send us guidance ! Make this the right thing to do . Where are D 'argo and Chiana ? Fortunately exchanging bodily fluids and checking a tracking station to locate Moya 's orbit . Doesn 't that just figure ? Look , let 's get that drink out of your hand . I 'm gonna sober you up , and get you out of here . Excuse me . Yeah , in a second buddy . Gimme the drink ! Were you once a Peacekeeper ? No . Oh , it 's Counselor Tyno , right ? Look , we gotta little problem . Our ship ... Your friends have been given access to our space command to find your ship . But for now ... . if you don 't mind ... . Look , I 'm a little partied out , so if you ... could maybe ... Please . OKay . That 's uh , sweet . It 's sweet , it 's kinda like molasses . Guards . Look ! Look at the Princess ! She 's smiling ! Uh oh . It cannot be ! No , Clayvor ! Take your claws off of me ! My sister is not supposed to be compatible with another Sebacean ! And as far as we know , she isn 't ! Do not make a spectacle , your highness ! The kiss was sweet ! They 're compatible ! What the hell 's goin ' on ? For your protection . And what if their DNA is cohesive ? Then , this pawn , whoever he is , must die tragically , within a solar day ! I understand everything you 're almost saying , except ... am I under arrest ? Absolutely not . Good . Please , try to understand ... I understand ! You asked me to kiss that chick ! You kissed our Princess ! Yeah , and now we 're compatible ? W - w - what the hell does that mean ? You 're the only male we 've found , who might be able to provide her with healthy children . You want a donation to the sperm bank ? I want you ... to consider marrying her . You would just have to be ... on this side of my life ... to understand ... how frelling insane that is ! She will be our next Empress . You ... would be Regent . Others would die for this chance . See ? Die ! There 's the problem , there 's a die part ! All I ask is that you consider this blessing that 's been laid before you . Blessing , Councilor Tyno ? When the actual truth of power is so much closer to curse . What ? Stop it ! Before I speak with them , not during ! She 's an ignorant creature . John Crichton , Prince Clayvor . Our second in line to the throne . First among my people . You may take the guards and leave us now , Tyno . My instructions are otherwise . This potential suitor to the throne is to remain under protective custody at all times . And who 's order dares to countermand mine ? The Empress . Your mother . I will speak with you ... ... . later . There 's always one ... . in every family . If Princess Katralla fails to wed by the anniversary of her birth , the throne goes to Prince Clayvor . Uh huh . And when 's the expiry day ? A matter of solar days . Is this my cell ? Your room , yes . Where have you two been ? We 've been in the space command center all night . Moya is no longer in orbit around this planet . And flight control confirmed that she didn 't crash . So , Zhaan and Pilot probably just ... Starbursted away and abandoned us . If we wanted to jump to conclusions ... You know Crichton 's in custody ? What ? Uh huh . He kissed some Princess and now they won 't let him go . Of all the stupid ... You want me to jump to another conclusion ? He probably wouldn 't be in this dren , if it wasn 't for you . Me ? Yeah , if you hadn 't rejected him ! It wasn 't my door he was last seen sniffing under ! Some women consider that a compliment ! Some women have to . As entertaining as this is at the moment , it 's getting us nowhere . Rygel 's with Crichton . When he comes back , we 'll have more information . As far as Moya goes , I think we should just wait . No . You 're coming with me , and you 're gonna show me where they 're keeping Crichton . We already tried ! They won 't let ya see 'im ! Shut up , Chiana . Ka D 'argo , is it ? I don 't believe we 've had the pleasure . I am totally unarmed . I bear you no ill will . Perhaps we should um ... well , re - order ... And share a repast . I knew there was more to it . Scorpius ! He doesn 't look at all ... Peacekeeper . His father was Scarran ... my race . His mother , Sebacean . He knows these companions of Crichton . Crichton surely works for Scorpius . By marrying a spy to your sister , they gain the advantage with your dynasty . And block our advance . Oh , forgive my ignorance , sagacious teacher , I trusted you to make this work ! Was it unwise of me ? You will rule . Not because you desire it Clayvor , but because I do ! This is Scorpius we are talking about . Yes , and it 's my life , D 'argo . Look , the Princess is nice . She 's sweet . And it might be fun to go shopping for the rest of my life , but I am not getting married . What 's the word on Moya ? Nothing . And what difference does it make , anyway ? Scorpius has a full Command Carrier out there , waiting for us . Which is probably why Zhaan and Pilot have taken off . He 's right , you know . Only place we 're safe is in this Palace . I 'm sorry . You 're sayin I should get married ? I would . - You 're a polygamist . - John . What ? Think it through . Scorpius has offered me a deal to turn you in . What , time share at his condo in hell ? He 's gonna leave the rest of us alone and he promises not to destroy your brain as long as you give him access to the wormhole technology in your brain . ... And you said ... ? ... That I 'd talk to you about it . That 's it . I was stalling him , John ! Now , Rygel and I are in agreement about this , so listen up ! You increase our chances of figuring something out , the longer you at least pretend to love this girl . Love ? Love ! R - rygel there is no love ! I am the reverse King Arthur . I am the one who could put the sword into the stone ! Alright , so what should we do ? I don 't care ! I don 't care what you guys do ! I know what I am going to do . I am going to tell a nice girl that I am not her ticket to the throne . Pilot , are you certain the Command Carrier is not behind us ? Positive . That is the shortest Starburst Moya is capable of . Practically an invitation for the Peacekeepers to follow . Then Scorpius has not taken our bait . Perhaps he 's already aware Crichton and the others are down on the planet . If so , that means we have abandoned our friends . There was nothing we could have done , had we stayed , Zhaan . Turn us around , Pilot , immediately . I will attempt to plot a course back . As you know , even a minor Starburst invalidates all previous navigation points . Just do it ! Pa U Zotoh ! The decision to flee was a joint one ! Normally this would be a time of great joy and celebration . But I must confess , I feel as if my ... As if your not gonna be King , 'cause I 'm gonna marry your sister . Relax , Ace , I 'm not gonna be your brother - in - law . Is this some kind of jest ? Jest ? No , it 's not a jest . On my planet , we don 't marry people we don 't love , unless they 're ... critically ill billionaires . No , just take it easy , bro . As soon as my ship returns , I 'm off this planet , you get to be king , congratulations . Princess Katralla , it 's good to see you again . I had given up hope of meeting a compatible Sebacean man . Yes , I uh , wanted to talk to you about that . Look uh , - I don 't know how to say this , so um ... - Daughter . Mother . You must be John Crichton . With delight . Empress . I anticipate sturdy grandchildren from you . Let us get to know one another . Have you proposed ? What ? No . No - no - no - no . I don 't love your daughter . How could you ? You just met . Why don 't you let your son be king ? He 's a fool . He would betray our neutrality for the genuflect of peasants . And that breech would toll in hundreds of millions of lives . Yeah , starting with mine . I have no purpose for you ... . Other than to keep my empire stable . If we recognize the Scarrans , Peacekeepers attack . Packed with Peacekeepers , Scarrans invade . You must wed Katralla . Empress , I understand your problems . But you need to understand , there 's nothing you can say , that 's going to make me marry your daughter . Oh , hello Crichton ! Something ... to remember me by . I have traveled a long , long way just to see you again ! I hate to say you wasted your time Scorpy , but you have . You know , that no matter what you think , the rifts between us need not be terminal . Go away Scorpy . It 's over . Find another girlfriend . Now don 't let her frighten you John , mm ? Now you make the correct decision . My daughter ... or that abomination . Choose . Bad ? Enough . She 's strong , and gets what she wants . What about you ? Rarely . So what do you want ? To be Empress . To have children . To keep the peace for my people . Even if we 're miserable for the rest of our lives ? I won 't make you miserable . I 'm sorry . Princess Katralla ... ... . will you consent to marry me ? Yes . What do you mean you have no choice ? No choice . Rock . Me . Hard place . Fight . Retreat . Remain silent . Scorpius . The Empress . You disappoint me , Crichton . You should lower your expectations . Well , at least the Princess is pretty . Yeah , I guess so . And wealthy . Suppose so . Think of all the power you 'll have . Yeah , can 't stop thinkin ' about it . That , and how I 'm gonna get off this planet the way I got here . Single , and alive . Well , I 'll see what I can do ... Congratulations ! Sorry ? Marrying our Princess . Dregon Casanova , cousin to the crown . John Crichton , Astronaut . Katralla 's a ... lovely girl . I wish you great happiness . Uh , and you would be ... ? Extremely pre - occupied . Excuse me . Perhaps some other time , then . We 'll do lunch ! He seemed like a nice guy . Stop it . So , any word on Moya ? We think she got spooked by Scorpius ' Command Carrier . Yes , spook . Spooky . That 's a good name for him , he has that effect . On you ? On everybody . How many guards have you seen since you got up here ? Too many . That 's right . They 're protecting me . From him . Look , the Empress , this is her ballgame . But if you have some suggestions , now would be a good time . I 'm just trying to figure out what they 're hiding from us . Well see if you can figure out someone else to marry the Princess . And if I can 't ? Better wed than dead . Oh , Tyno . I truly believe my mother will force me to marry this stranger . We can only hope . We can only hope ? What am I supposed to say , Katralla ? You 're supposed to say " No ! Stop this travesty ! " You 're supposed to say " No , I will not let you marry that man ! " You 're supposed to take me away from this madness that is my life ! There 's too much at stake to stop this , now , you must exchange espouses . But I love you ! As I love you . But our union is not destined to be . You must go to Crichton . You must do your duty . Crichton is such a frelling fool ! He has no choice . Oh , please ! Princess pretend doesn 't even love him ! She wants that Tyno . You 're forgetting about Scorpius . We can hide from him in the barren lands outside the city until he leaves . Marrying her is the only thing that will save Crichton 's life , Aeryn . Don 't you get that ? I 've had just about enough of you . No - no - no . It 's not me that you 're mad at . You should have told him how you felt , when you had a chance . You don 't know anything . Yeah ? Well I know about men . You see that one over there ? How many times has he tried to come onto you ? What ? Three ? Four ? Look , he 's ... he 's well bred , he 's rich . Handsome . Perfect . You 're gonna let him get away too . You know why ? Oh , go on . Tell me . Because you only want the ones you can 't have ! So you 're gonna go to Crichton , you 're gonna mess with his mind , he 's gonna be turned over to Scorpius , and dead . This marriage is wrong and you both know it ! Pilot ! why are we still moving away from the Royal planet ? Moya is following a signal of some sort and refuses to give up the trail . Does she know that Scorpius did not follow us ? Does she know we have to return to the planet to help our friends ? Yes , but she is driven forward . What sort of signal is it , Pilot ? Impossible to describe to our satisfaction . But one of her eight senses clearly identifies it as familiar and ... compelling . Oooh , perfect . I don 't believe I 've had the pleasure . Yes , I 've heard that about Scarrans . Perhaps we could talk for a moment . In private . I have a message for Scorpius . Scorpius ? I know you work together , I saw your Luxan with him . Go ahead . We will not tolerate your interference , so far out in what you condescendingly call the Uncharted Territories . Is there anything else ? Yes . Is your presence here the vanguard of a larger invading force ? I shall send your regards to Scorpius . I had hoped to learn your mind by conversation , however , if I must invade it ... Don 't stop now . Go on , kill each other . Save me the trouble . My apologies , Empress . I rarely bother with warnings . Consider yourself the beneficiary of largess . Empress . Listen carefully , Peacekeeper . The longer Crichton plays the part he 's been assigned ... the more likely we 'll keep our internal organs ... internal . Do not dissuade him from this marriage . Thank you , Rygel . I 'll do what I think is right . For Crichton ? Or for you ? Just a small burn , Princess . Almost finished . You know ... you take anymore samples of my DNA , there 's not gonna be enough left to be me . What species are you ? Since you 're not Sebacean . Human . I keep trying to tell you guys that , but nobody seems to wanna listen . We still don 't . The Empress has ordered the revelation sealed . No one will ever know . It 's that important I marry the Princess ? Our dynastic integrity ... has always insured peace . Any fraction ... and the whole region could erupt . Then why don 't you marry her ? Her DNA was poisoned . Unreceptive to anyone . Until you . Would you activate the machine for me , please ? Her brother . Very discerning . With help , we believe , from the Scarran emissary . John ! Come look . Oh ! This is truly amazing , Crichton ! I must have one for my kingdom . Boy , or girl ? I 'm sorry , what ? The DNA testing confirms our insipid kiss . Our children will be healthy . Disease free . And you can see what they 'll be like . Oh - ho - ho ! How many nasty surprises could I have avoided ! Male infant , please . Hey buuuuuddy . What 's up ? Where 'd you come from ? Look at you , slugger . This is ... this is what ... . our child would look like ? One possibility . The choice is ours . Would you like to see him grown up ? Yes . Please . Not ... not too grown up . Hi dad . Astounding device ! Oh ! Oh ! Looks just like you ! Yeah , he does , kinda . Yet , he may be able to overcome it . Thank you . That 's all . Not to be obtrusive , but the royal tailor would like to see you for a fitting . You 're scheduled to meet members of the royal family court . And you must work on a pose for your governant 's statue . Statue ? Get out of town . Alright , fine . Well , on Earth we have this Queen , she uh , she 's got this wave . I 'll ... I 'll do that . Hardly a pose you 'd like to hold for eighty cycles , I 'm afraid . W - what eighty cycles ? I just assumed you knew . Knew what ? Crichton 's DNA is compatible ! It 's not a trick ! Then your loyalists must assassinate him ! You 've really frelled up this time , Cargn , this is not part of our bargain ! Scorpius is here , because your mother let him attend . Oh , so now it 's my mother 's fault , huh ? I have half a mind to tell her about you ! You do have half a mind , your Highness . But will you actually reveal our pact ? No . Can you see past childishness to realize any betrayal means your instant death ? Even if mine follows . Yes . I am ... curious , dear Jenavia , to learn of your loyalties . As I interrogated your loving fiancée ' , what was going through your delicate little mind ? I ... I was hoping you wouldn 't wear that to our wedding . Destiny 's couple , you are . Why has Moya brought us here , Pilot ? I don 't know . Moya continues to be evasive with me . However , I assume it has something to do with that . What is it , Pilot ? Is it alive ? Yes . Does Moya know this living thing ? Yes . Who is it ? The ... builders . Their creators . Her ... God . Did you hear ? About the statue ? Hey , Chiana . Eighty cycles . Eighty cycles ! That is roughly eighty years to you and me ... and over five hundred years to dogs ! Why don 't you stay and tell us about it , John ? Did you know about the statue , when you were convincing me to marry the princess ? I don 't know about it now . After we 're married , and I mean ... right after we 're married , they turn us into statues . That . Is . Fascinating . Excellent . D 'argo discovers science . To what purpose ? Governing continuity . They screw with our molecular structure , turn us into pigeon perches and we preside over their Senate , or whatever the hell they call it , for eighty cycles . As ... a statue ? Yeah . I mean , we can see and hear . Don 't ask me how ! and we are supposed to absorb every single facet of their governmental system . That way , when mom and pops finally kick it , we rule . Perhaps that 's why they 've endured nineteen hundred cycles of peace . It works . You 're like a brochure . You have to go through with it , John . Eighty cycles . M - my college loans will be delinquent . I 'll miss the strippers on my hundredth birthday . I - I 'll get a utility bill ... for three trillion dollars for a single porch light that I left on , and everybody I know , will be dead ! The alternative ... . is having your brain dissected by Scorpius . Humans ... do not live ... as long as Sebaceans , or Hynerians or Delvians . When I get back ... . everyone ... my dad , DK , my sisters , Cameron Diaz , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , will be dead ! Well , you may never see these people again , anyway . Hope . D 'argo . It 's what keeps y ... you going . You 're gonna see your son . I 'm gonna get home . Hope . I have hope . Or I am nothing . Look at what fate has given you . Scorpius will no longer be a threat . And as a ruler , you will have ... power ... peace ... prosperity . You could uh ... create a family . Perhaps you 've only just discovered your true destiny . You 've been spending way too much time with Chiana , you know that ? Amongst all the fluff , she can make a lot of sense . Our time was good , John . We had each other when we needed each other . But now it 's time to look past your fears . See what 's on the road ahead . If I do this ... you have to be my best man . Uh ... .. I 'm with Chiana now , John . Do you talk ? When asked to , Highness . So uh ... . you work for the royal family ? For twenty - two cycles . Since Katralla and Clayvor were children . I am happy she has found you as a mate , Highness . No uh , lose the Highness part . I 'm John , call me that . I am Ro 'Na . Ro 'Na Could you give us a moment please ? So you 're going to listen to D 'argo over me , are you ? Is that right ? The Empress has made it clear . I marry her daughter or she hands me to Scorpius ! Eighty cycles as a statue ? It 's better than Scorpius ! Is it ? He 's in my head . The back of my mind . Corner of my eye . He scares me Aeryn and I can 't shake him . I don 't know what you 're talking about , but there 's never been anything we couldn 't overcome together . Except each other . I can 't come to the wedding . I want you there . Don 't be absurd . I need you ... there . Aeryn ... . don 't you think ... that there are things to say ? At this point , what else can we say , except goodbye ? You 're right . You 're always right . Bye . Welcome to Barbie world . They 're almost ready for you , Highness . Here 's your wedding present . From Prince Clayvor . John TO BE CONTINUED

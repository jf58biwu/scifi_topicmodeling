 [ Broots ] It 's Jarod 's last lair . We know that much . - How long since he left ? - It 's about 24 hours . We got a Clean-up crew takin ' the place apart as we speak . Same old song and dance . Yeah . [ Miss Parker ] Who 's the egg heading the go-cart ? - That 's Dr. Guchi Tuchen . - The new head of the Centre 's Clean-up unit . - Credentials impeccable . - Yeah , he 's from Calcutta . Remind me to cancel the frozen steaks for Christmas . Ah , Dr. Tuchen . This is - The infamous Miss Parker . - Excuse me for not standing . - Not a problem . So , what did our little genius leave us to clean up this time ? I 'm afraid it 's a bit disturbing in nature . How so ? Here . - P.C.P. - Ridiculous . Jarod wouldn 't use drugs . I 'm afraid I will have to disagree . We ran a series of field tests on the blood residual of the syringes ... and it matched Jarod 's perfectly . [ Sydney ] With what Jarod 's been through ... addiction is a distinct possibility . - Jarod 's a junkie ? - We also found this . It 's Jarod 's writing . [ Broots ] What , do you think he left it here by accident ? Maybe he really is caught up in some kind of drug haze . [ Man Over Walkie-Talkie , Indistinct ] [ Chattering ] We got one over here already in the building . I don 't know what he 's on , but you 're gonna have to lock him down . - How 's your personal injury insurance ? - Paid in full . No one 's gonna hurt ya . We just wanna make sure you 're okay . - Let 's do this easy , okay , pal ? Come on . - Easy . Okay , let 's go . Nice and easy . Nice and easy . [ Grunting ] - Come on ! - No ! No ! Mommy ! No ! No ! Mommy ! - Dad ! No ! - Grab his feet ! Mommy ! Daddy ! Don 't let them take me ! [ Yelling ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . - [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . - [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - [ Siren Wails ] - [ Police Radio , Indistinct ] - [ Grunting ] - Come on ! - Who do we got ? - Trouble . You 'd better keep both eyes on this one . Welcome to Vista House , Mr.Jones. I 'm Dr. Earl . I am your staff psychologist . I am here to help you with your recovery . Understand that no one can stop you from using but you . - [ Muffled Laugh ] - Check his bag . Now , Mr. Jones , I need you to sign this . [ Panting ] What is it ? It is a consent form empowering us to place you in lockdown . Lockdown ? I don 't like being locked up . We need to take control during the initial period of your withdrawal . I know that may sound extreme , but I believe our success rate speaks for itself . Thank you . What do you got , Garrett ? Got a change of clothes , bath robe , wallet ... - $ 48 cash ... - Mm-hmm . red notebook , blank . - I keep a journal . - [ Dr. Earl ] Excellent . A big part of your recovery will be writing down ... a searching and fearless moral self-inventory . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold on , hold on . [ Grunting ] We have a code of ethics around here . It 's called the circle of trust . You gain our trust , it comes back to you in the way of privileges . Betray that trust , the circle is broken . Consider this a warning . [ Straining , Grunting ] I-I don 't feel so good . Get him a bucket . [ Miss Parker ] " I 'm searching for a special man . " If you are handsome , emotionally secure ... " and have learned some of life 's harder lessons ... we might have something in common . " How does it feel to be the mayor of Loserville ? - I-I read that for entertainment . - Right . What did you find out about Jarod 's latest clue ? The " 101776 " clearly relates to October 17 , 1976 . The A-22 part has me stumped , though . It 's either August or April 22 ... and it could relate to SL 22 . Maybe if you stopped reading the want ads and - I 'll be dammed . - What ? What is it ? - My lucky day , apparently . " A-22 . " Section " A , " page 22 . Broots , go get the microfiche from the Blue Cove paper ... dated October 17 , 1976 . Maybe we can find out why Jarod is hopped up on heroin . Sydney , you all right ? Sydney , you all right ? - [ Jarod ] Okay , I 'm cured . Let me out of here . - [ Man ] This is how it plays . The doctors are like the generals . They 're sittin ' up there on the hill . They 're watchin ' the battle . But I 'm the grunt . I 'm down there in the field . I 'm lookin ' out for my buddies . You gonna be my buddy there , Jarod ? - Sure . Why not ? - Good answer . Okay , I bring you your meals , I supervise your drug tests . I clean your clothes . I will even mop up your puke , man . The only thing I ask in return is that you don 't give me any trouble . This ain 't easy what you 're gonna be goin through here , but I can help make it ... a whole lot more productive , okay ? - Sorry , baby . Whoa . - Rusty ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! Come on ! I 'm sick ! - I need somethin ' ! - See that guy ? He is not my buddy . Come on . We gotta make a pit stop . All right , here . Fill it up , unleaded . - Can I get some privacy ? - You 're holdin ' the cup , aren 't ya ? [ Buzzer Sounds ] Well , not exactly The Four Seasons . But let 's face it . You couldn 't afford The Four Seasons . [ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Shivering ] It 's-It 's so cold in here . Yeah , well , you won 't think so once the hot flashes kick in . All right , you got a bucket for whatever comes up , and it 'll come up . Trust me . I don 't think I can do this . I just , uh , need a little somethin ' ... you know , to carry me through , you understand ? Just-Just somethin ' for tonight , please ? - Get your hands off me , man ! - Come on . Don 't leave me in here ! You can 't leave me in here ! Don 't leave me - Come on ! Don 't leave me - [ Panting , Grunting ] Well , bottoms up . - [ Chattering ] - [ Jarod Vomiting ] Great . [ Vomiting Continues ] [ Dr. Earl ] We have a new member of our group . - This is Jarod . - Welcome to Heroin Hilton , Jarod . Thank you , Huey . Jarod , why don 't you tell the group what brought you here ? A large cop with bad breath . Very clever . Perhaps you could be a little more specific ? No , man , there 's nothin ' you can tell us we haven 't already heard or seen . Let 's just say that I 'm going through a slight identity crisis . Okay . Today , I want to talk about responsibility ... about how we refuse to take responsibility for our addiction . Instead , we blame everybody and everything else . Well , I 'll tell ya this , Doc . You know , if I fall back into my habit ... I 'm blaming Jill . - Shut up , Huey . - Chick 's drivin 'me nuts ... cryin ' every five seconds ... yammering ' on about her smack binge last week . " I 'm clean . I didn 't use . I don 't know how it happened ! " It 's the truth . I don 't know how it happened . - That 's whack , baby . - I thought this was supposed to be a support group ? She tested positive for opiates , dude . Her denying ' she even used is a lie . You 're a liar . - I 'm not a liar . - Liar , liar , liar . - You don 't know that . - Okay , new meat . Maybe the smack just kind of floated down from the heavens ... and landed right in your bloodstream . I lost custody of my son last week ! Why would I jeopardize the most important thing in my life to use ? - Because you 're a junkie . - I 'm not a junkie anymore , Huey . I don 't want him seeing ' me in here like this . Have an attitude of gratitude , Jill , hmm ? You 're blessed . Your son is going to get to see you again , clean and alive . What Huey is saying is that ... you need to accept the fact that you have a problem . I know I have a problem , Dr. Earl . I lost my son . Section " A , " page 22 had five obituaries . So I ran the names through the database , and one of them ... a guy named David Arnold , used to work here . - [ Miss Parker ] When ? - It doesn 't say . And there 's no other information on him , which is really strange ... because you know how this place is about background checks . Which makes your presence here even more of a mystery . This is ridiculous ! What if something happens to Jarod ... while we 're chasing ghosts ? Broots , keep working the number codes , and stay on this David Arnold lead . Sure . No problem . And , Broots ? You report onlyto me . That 's a fine-looking little boy you have there . I never actually knew my mother , but I always imagined how great our relationship would be . Look-Jarod , right ? I appreciate you defending me in here ... but , please , leave me alone , okay ? Sorry , I can 't do that . You see , the reason I 'm in here ... is to help you , as a favor to your father . My father 's been dead for over 20 years . Jill , I know . Jill ? Your little boy 's here . He 's waitin ' for you in the visitation lounge . - I can 't let him see me like this . - You 're his mother . Nothing can change the way he feels about you . [ Man On Speaker ] Hilary and I have a lot to do with you today , sport . We 've gotta pick up your tux for the wedding . I 've gotta get the plane tickets . So you just say hi to Mommy , and then let 's get going , okay ? Todd , honey ? The tuxedo shop is open late ... and the travel agent can messenger you the tickets . Please , Daddy ? Chris , you spend as much time with your mommy as you want , okay ? - Okay . - Okay . Guess who . - Mommy ! - Hey ! Look at you ! - I 've missed you so much ! - I missed you too . Why are you shaking , Mommy ? - Mommy 's been sick , baby . - Are you gonna get better ? Yes . And guess what . If Dr. Earl says it 's okay , I can come home in a couple of days . [ Chris ] Does that mean I get to live with you ? Well , honey , no . Don 't you love me anymore ? Yes , of course I do . I love you with all my heart . Oh , God . Garrett ! Circle of trust , Jarod . Whatever you 're doing in here , you just broke the circle . Take him back to his room . [ Buzzer Sounds ] Come on . Yeah . [ Beeps , Buzzer Sounds ] These are his orders . [ Beeps , Buzzer Sounds ] - What are you doing here ? - I just wanna talk to you . This is the only place that we can talk unmonitored . Please trust me . Just leave me alone . I don 't think he would have wanted that . Where 'd you get this ? Your father gave it to me . I was taken from my family when I was a boy . That photograph was your father 's way of giving me a family when I needed one . I realize that all this sounds crazy , but it 's the truth . You don 't belong in here . And I know ... you never would have done anything to jeopardize the custody of your son . You know , I remember when this picture was taken . I was a junior in high school . That was the year everything went crazy . I met this great guy . A dealer . God , I got strung out so fast . And your father got you clean . No guilt trips . Just unconditional love . Then he died . I stayed clean through the whole thing . I was clean for a long time . That 's when I met Todd . We got married , had Chris . It was such a good life . And then you started using again . Yeah . I don 't have an excuse for it . I screwed up . By the time I realized what I had done ... Todd had left , and he took Chris . Then Todd met Hilary . I knew if I was ever gonna get my boy back ... I could never use drugs again . So I got clean again . I got my teaching credential . Everything was fine . The court was gonna give me custody . Then the day before the final hearing - I swear to God I don 't remember using . So I lost any chance of getting my little boy back . There is always a chance . Not for me . Once Hilary and Todd get married ... she can legally adopt him , and then that 's the end . Tell me about this day that you said you don 't remember using . I remember the morning . I was clean . I came here for my weekly drug test . I woke up three days later strung out in the park . I wouldn 't have thrown it all away - not my life , not my family . [ Beeps , Buzzer Sounds ] Hello , J ill . How are we feeling today ? - Okay . - Good . Nurses tell me you 've been having a little trouble sleeping . Would you like a clonidine patch ? Yes , please . All right . There . That should help you relax . Thank you . Jill , I just wanna let you know , if all goes well ... I think I can have you out of here by Friday . - Really ? - Really . We just wanna make sure that you 're ready ... - and there aren 't gonna be any setbacks , okay ? - I 'm ready . I promise . Good . You get some sleep ... and I will check in on you later , okay ? Okay . [ Beeps , Buzzer Sounds ] [ Broots ] The Delaware cartographer 's offiice ... is e-mailing me a map coded 101776 . - A-22 should be the coordinates that lead us to Jarod . - Good work . Will you let us know the minute it comes in ? - Oh , yeah , yeah . - Broots , I wanna review your G-4 report with you . All right . I 'll catch up with you , Sydney . Hmm . - What do you got ? - Okay . You know Winkey , the old guy with the facial ticks that works down in the infirmary ? - We haven 't had the pleasure . - Okay . Anyway ... he remembers this David Arnold who used to work there as an orderly like 20 years ago . So I cross-referenced Arnold 's name with the infirmary 's D.S.A. database ... and I came up with two matches . The only problem is they 're missing from Winkey 's archives . Somebody 's really gone to some trouble ... erasing this guy from the history books around here . You 've been making unauthorized entries into the infirmary 's database . If it 's David Arnold you want to know about ... I can tell you he was one of the kindest , gentlest men I ever had the pleasure of knowing . - What 's he doing these days ? - Pushing up daisies . Arnold is deader than your hair follicles . [ Sighs ] Tell me then , Miss Parker ... how does David Arnold get you any closer to finding Jarod ? We explore all avenues in pursuit of Jarod , even the dead ones . He wouldn 't be bugging us about a database hit ... unless he had something to hide . The answer lies in those missing D.S.A.s , which are mostly likely ... in Raines 's private collection . - # [ Dance ] - [ Woman ] Great . And one , and two , and three , and four . Keep it going . Almost finished . Breathe . Good , and arms . And one , and two , and three , and four . Good job . Hey , nice ride , dude . What are we waitin ' for ? Let 's get the hell out of here . Even if I could start it , they don 't let me ride it . You know anything about motorcycle maintenance ? Well , I read a book on it once . Nothin ' to do with motorcycles , however . - Whoa , whoa . Whoa . God . - Does it flood when you hit the throttle ? Yeah . The tabs from your float bowl are disconnected from the needle , see ? I 'll be dammed . Hey , thanks . Cool shirt . What 's " Skint Rabbit " ? It 's a rock-and-roll band . We had a big hit in the ' 80s . - " Bloody Love Bones " ? - I was kinda out of it in the ' 80s . And the ' 70s . Most of the ' 90s , for that matter . Yeah , who wasn 't ? But I was their head roadie . We went everywhere . Toured with the biggest . Stones , Allman Brothers . Then we released two lame albums . The next thing you know , we are warming ' up high school gyms for Air Supply . Were they having trouble with their ventilation system ? Exactly . Hey , listen , brother , um , I really need to score . I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . Come on . Your clammy skin , your beady little pupils . I think you know exactly what I mean . Come on . Help me out . Garrett 's your man . [ Jarod ] Garrett ? - Unless he got busted again . - Again ? Earl nailed him a few weeks ago dealing ' smack to an outpatient . How does an orderly in a drug rehabilitation center get away with that ? Hey , man , there 's stuff goin ' on around here none of us will ever know about . Jill ? Jill ? Jill ? Jill ? Somebody get in here ! She 's O.D. ' ing ! Jill ? - I will take care of this . I will take care of this . - Check her respiration . I need an airway and some 02 stat ! Get in here ! Get in there ! Get in there ! Jill ? Jill ? Jill , how could you do this to yourself ? [ Broots ] Raines almost caught me . I had to hide under his couch for over an hour . Then his masseuse came in and rubbed him down with oil ... while they were singing " Shall We Gather at the River . " The D.S.A.s ? You are not gonna believe this . [ Buzzer Sounds ] - Jill . - Jarod , I swear I don 't know how this happened . It doesn 't matter . What matters now is getting you through this . Come on , come on . Let 's get you in the bed . Come on . Come on . I 'm beginning to think maybe I 'm doing this . I can 't remember what 's happening to me anymore . Oh , God . I can 't go through this again . I don 't have the strength . You 're going to have to find the strength for your son . - I 've lost him . - No , you haven 't . [ Sobbing ] [ Vomiting ] Why are you doing this ? - I owe your father . - For what ? [ Young Jarod ] Somebody help me ! Somebody help me ! [ Grunting , Sobbing ] Somebody help me ! [ Sobbing Continues ] - So he had a bad flu . - This isn 't the flu , Miss Parker . Watch . [ Tape Rewinding ] The self-righteous son of a bitch got Jarod hooked on narcotics . Here . You have to drink and stay hydrated . - One more . Come on . - No . Why would that place - Why would the Centre give a child drugs ? Because to them , I was never a child . You called for me , Doctor ? I need you to clean up the room . The boy 's sick . Yes , sir . Hey , kid . I 'm one of the orderlies . Help me , please . What 's wrong with you ? Oh , my God . Who did this to you ? Please help me . Just hang in there , buddy . I 'm gonna help you through this , okay ? Everything 's gonna be fine . [ Broots ] That 's David Arnold . There 's the connection to Jarod . Arnold helped him get through detox . I 'm so hot , I feel like I 'm burning up . - Just hang tough . It 'll pass . - I hurt all over . - Hang tough . It 'll pass . - [ Vomits ] - I don 't think I can do this . - Yes , you can . Just stay focused on me . Come on . Come on . Just a little bit to make the pain go away . - I can 't do that , Jarod . - I can 't do this ! You 've gotta get me something . Please-Please get me something . How about him ? Is he enough ? I need my-my family here to help me . Where is your family ? I don 't know . I can 't remember . Here . You hang onto that . Let my daughter Jill and I be your family . I don 't know how I 'm ever gonna repay you for this . Don 't worry about it . One day , you will . Wait . Miss Parker , you have to see the next D.S.A. - Mr. Arnold ? - Yes , sir ? You 're to be commended . Thank you . I don 't mean to overstep my position here ... but what possible reason could you have to get this kid hooked on drugs ? That 's not your concern . Oh . I 'm making it my concern , sir . You 'll be amply rewarded for your efforts . You know , you can keep your money . I don 't want anything to do with this place . We have a problem . [ Broots ] This is dated October 17 .. the day before David Arnold ... accidentally drowned in his own swimming pool . Raines had him killed to keep him quiet . I can 't help wondering , where was Sydney during all this ? He was Jarod 's protector . How could he let this happen ? That 's a good question . I deserve to lose him . Hilary will make a much better mother . I just don 't know how this happened . Well , it 's about time we found out . Garrett , you got a patient loose . [ Beeps , Buzzer Sounds ] What the hell were you doin out of your room ? Were you afraid I was gonna find your drug stash ? All right , you son of a bitch . How could you do that ? How could you give drugs to a woman who was tryin ' to turn her life around ? - What the hell are you talkin ' about ? - I 'm talking about Jill Arnold ! I 'm talking about doctoring her clonidine patch with pure heroin . I didn 't ! - You wanna deal with me , or should I call the police ? - Go to hell . You 're the drug supplier here . Why 'd you do it ? I swear ! I swear ! I don 't even have access to the clonidine patches . - Only Dr. Earl could have laced them with heroin . - Heroin he got from you ! - [ Toilet Flushes ] - All right , all right , all right . When Earl caught me dealing ' to Huey , he threatened ... to have me arrested unless I scored for him , all right ? I had no idea he was gonna use it on a patient . - Why is Dr. Earl keeping Jill Arnold on drugs ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know ! I don 't . I swear to God , I don 't . But I can get you into his office . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Hello , Hilary . I 'm calling for Dr. Earl . It seems a situation has come up regarding Jill Arnold . He needs you to come down here right away . [ Jarod ] Uh , Hilary , right ? Dr. Earl said ... he was running just a little bit late . Can I offer you a glass of water while you wait ? [ Young Jarod Groaning ] Somebody help me ! Sydney , how could you let this happen ? He was just a boy , Syd . In those days , the Centre was working with people ... who were trying to perfiect a synthesized narcotic ... that might enhance mental perfiormance . So you let them experiment on Jarod ? It was Raines 's decision . I guess the idea ofa great mind like Jarod 's becoming greater still ... was just too exciting to walk away from . The drug , of course , it turned out ... had pretty serious side effects . Rapid addiction and devastating withdrawal . So Raines turns Jarod into a junkie lab rat ... and you bury your head in the sand ? Sydney , why ? [ Panting , Grunting ] They turned Sydney into an addict . [ Dr. Earl Groaning ] [ Both Gasp ] - Oh , my God . Where am I ? - What 's happening to me ? I would imagine that Jill Arnold must have asked herself the very same question . - Jarod ? - I think we should have a little group therapy session . Only this time , the two of you get to be the patients . - What are you talking about ? - Circle of trust , Doc . You give Jill Arnold drugs against her will . I do the very same thing to the two of you . Only this time , I use a hybrid narcotic ... that chemically tricks the brain into thinking you 've been addicted for years . What you 're experiencing now , physically and mentally ... that 's what 's known as " cold turkey . " - Gobble , gobble . - You 're sick . - You son of a bitch . Now , that is not expressing an attitude of gratitude , Doc . But not to worry . I brought along ... some clonidine patches to help take that pain away . - Please , give me a patch . - First , we should talk about ... investigating our moral self-inventory to decide ... - which one of you actually deserves a patch . - Give it to me ! - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm somebody that can help end your torment . - Just tell me the truth . - Come on . I can 't take this . - Don 't give it to her , Jarod ! Give it to me ! - Just-Just-Just talk to me . - I can 't . - Mmm - Okay . Okay . Please , give-give me a patch . I guess you can look forward to the next eight hours ... with your head in a bucket . [ Mimics Vomiting ] Give me a patch , please . - [ Hilary ] Please give me a patch . - One clonidine patch down . - [ Dr. Earl ] Jarod , give it to me . - Okay . Okay . He did it . - What ? - He needed the money . - Shut up , you stupid bitch ! - Oh , please . Come on . You said nobody would find out . You 're the one who needed that stupid kid . You wanted the boy ! - Hey ! - Please , give me one ofthe patches . Let me guess . It went something like this . Todd Moffiett is a very rich man . So rich , in fact , that if you two were to get divorced ... you could stand to make one hell of a payday ... especially if you were to adopt his son . And what better way to insure custody ... than to turn his biological mother into a junkie . - And who better to help you than your ex-college sweetheart . - How did you know that ? Let 's just say that I took a little peek ... into the doc 's college yearbook . You two make such a cute little couple . It seems so sad ... that college sweethearts such as yourself ... are gonna have to experience such horrific pain . I 've had my experience with that little devil you 're on . And let me tell you - Somebody help me ! it 's a bitch . Only one clonidine patch left . It would be a shame to have to white-knuckle it through such a terrible detox . Okay ! I did it . I drugged Jill Arnold so she would lose custody of her son . - Now can I have that patch , please ? - No , he did it . Please give me the patch . Like you say , Doc ... recovery starts when an individual admits that he or she has a problem . Isn 't that right , Todd ? - That 's right . - Oh , God . Let me tell you , the two of you have one hell of a problem . Listen , sport , we 're gonna see Mommy in just a few minutes . - Okay . - So Jill was tellin the whole truth after all . I feel like a real punk laying ' into her the way I did . Hey , you live and you learn . Yeah , but I 've decided , you know , I 'm gonna finish up my time here the right way . I 've just been kind of goin ' through the motions . I gotta start thinkin ' about my future . Good for you . - Thanks a lot , Jarod . Somethin ' for you . - Hey , what 's this ? - Skint Rabbit . - Oh , wow . " Bloody Love Bones . " But don 't listen to it backwards . You 'll end up here for real . Thanks for everything . I-I hope I can make this up to Jill . Now 's your chance . Mommy ! Mommy , are we going home now ? We are gonna go home in two seconds , okay ? - You look good . - I 'm startin ' to feel good . So what now ? One day at a time . Jarod , I don 't know how I could ever repay you for everything you 've done . The debt 's already been paid . Thank you . - [ Phone Ringing ] - Sydney . I didn 't think you 'd still be working . Good of you to call . I was getting really worried . 'Cause you thought I might have slipped back into my childhood drug addiction ? Just tell me why . Why did you let them do that to me ? Jarod - You 're the only person that I trusted . You were like a - You should 've stopped them , Sydney . Jarod , I couldn 't . Why not ? Because I was a test subject myself . What are you talking about ? I asked Raines - Rather , I demanded ... that you be left out of the drug testing and that they use me instead . And Raines agreed . It was only when I came out of detox that I realized what had happened - that he 'd lied . So you sacrificed yourself to protect me . Why didn 't you ever tell me that ? I never wanted you to feel obligated ... to stay here at the Centre ... if you had a chance to get away . I 'm sorry , Jarod . I 'm really sorry .

 Tokyo . Its people , its colors , its contours are now just a hazy memory . How could I remember what I took for granted ? I could always see it with my own eyes . Dragon Head Teru , catch ! Discipline , young man ! Open up ! Hello ? Hey ! Anybody ? Hey ! Hey ! Somebody ! Am I the only one ? They 're all dead ? You 're alive . Thank God ! I 'm Aoki Teru from Class Five . You are ? What happened ? I 'm totally confused . The " end " . Eh ? What is ? I said it 's the end . End of what ? Morikawa , Kato and Hirata . Serves them right . All of them killed by the red light . Everything 's changed . I 'll have you know that I 've changed too . What are you talking about ? Did anyone else survive ? What do you think ? Take a good look around . That 's stupid . Seconds ago , you were whining . So don 't give me any crap . The dining car ? Do you think they 'll come soon ? Who ? Help . The rescue squad . They won 't come . Of course they will ! If they don 't , we won 't make it ! The food will spoil in this heat ! Stop being so damn negative ! But it 's true . Get out ! I said get the hell out ! Now , take it easy . Don 't think you can push me around ! Okay , just take it easy . Get out ! Beat it ! That guy 's nuts ! Who 's there ? You 're hurt ? He 's ... he 's crazy ! What ? Nobuo . You saw him , didn 't you ? I had to get away from him . Hey , listen ? Did anyone else survive ? Do you know what happened ? As soon as we entered the tunnel , there was a huge boom . Right before that , some guys had locked Nobuo up in the toilet . It saved his life ! Takahashi ? Teacher ! Teacher , help me ! Help me , please ! Nobuo ? Help ... It hurts . Please ! I need help ! You 're the adult here ? You 're in charge , arent you ? You 're supposed to help me ! Please ... help . Help you ? Why should I ? You sat there doing nothing while they beat me ! So shut your trap ! You 're supposed to help me ! Help me ! You don 't know this , but I can dish it out too . It 's time for a little payback ! Take that ! Who 's pathetic now ? You 're normal , right ? Yeah . Well ? You are ? Really ? ! I think so . Thanks ! That guy 's nuts going on about red lights . Red lights ? Yeah . What in God 's name happened ? An earthquake ? Outside , they should be searching for us by now . Right ? Don 't you think ? We need to treat that wound . Where 're you going ? To find some disinfectant . We have to hang on until help comes . This is madness ! Seto Ako ? You 're alive . Come here ! I 'm sorry , Nobuo . I am ! This way ! Please ! Come see my new home ? Stop ! You 're hurting me ! We 've got to get along . We 're all friends here ! What 're you doing ? Well ? We 've got to embrace the darkness . Stop babbling nonsense ! You saw them too ? The red lights ... What 's with you and red lights ? You didn 't see them , then ? The red flash in the windows ? Bright red ? No . It 's not just the tunnel . We 're the only survivors anywhere . We 're all that 's left . Our only choice is to live here ! We can 't survive in here ! It 's too hot ! The food will rot ! What about water ? No problem . What do you mean ? It is a problem ! It 's a very big problem ! You 've totally flipped ! Go ahead and live here then ! When help arrives , go hide ! I told you , nobody 's coming . You don 't know shit , do you ? Shut up ! Hey ! The radio ! I heard a voice ! It 's all over ! Stop it ! Please ! I 'm a lot stronger now . Shut up ! I 'm not listening to you ! You 're a fool ! A weak fool ! He 'll be all right . Hey , get up . Hurry ! In here ! Quick ! We 're leaving ! We can 't wait for help to arrive . I warned you . I 'm not a pushover anymore . What 'll we do ? The roof ! What ? We 'll climb up to it . How ? Hurry ! You okay ? Let 's go . Wait ! Are you serious ? We have no choice ! But my knee hurts ! I 'll pull you up ! I 'm too scared ! Stay behind with him , then ! See if I care ! I 'm going home . Wait ! Stop ! We found an exit ! Stop it ! Teru ! Stop it ! Teru , don 't ! Wow , you almost had me there ! Let go ! I made this myself ! Who cares about that ? Stop it ! Shut up and get moving ! Don 't go ! This is the only safe haven left ! What 's safe about it ? Open your damn eyes ! Please stop ! Let 's go ! Hurry up ! No , I 'm scared ! Teru ? I can 't . I can 't ! Hurry up ! I 'm scared ! I said hurry up ! Nobuo ! Come on ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Teru ! Sato-san ! Sato-san ! Move it ! Where 's my souvenir ? How was the trip ? Did you like Kyoto ? Hey ! Look ! An exit ? What is this ? What 's all this white stuff ? That isn 't the sky , is it ? Is that the sky ? Teru ! Wait up ! Wait ! Where are we ? What is this place ? Shut up ! Don 't ask so many damn questions . If you don 't know , how in the hell should I ? You don 't have to be such a jerk about it ! I 'm just confused , all right ? My knee and throat are killing me ! Damn it ! What 's happened ? Somebody tell me ; what the hell do we do now ? I need a doctor for this . And some water , and food And a bath ! Why do we have to go through this ? Maybe Nobuo was right after all ! Then maybe you should 've listened to him ! Whatire you doing ? Going to look for food and water And survivors . But ? You heard the radio , right ? It could 've been just static . We can 't stay here ! Just leave me alone ! Forget about me ! We walked for days through the white ash . Days . Hello ! Anyone ? Hello ! Sato-san . There 's no water , is there ? We 've got to embrace the darkness . Here ! Sato-san ! Here 's some tea ! Thank you . A town . Huh ? I wonder what 's become of Tokyo ? If we return and there 's nobody ? Sorry . I 'm sorry . Teru , what 's wrong ? Are you alright ? Oh , hello . Excuse us , but ? We were , um ? On a train in a tunnel when We had an accident ! When did all this happen ? We don 't know anything ! What happened here ? How unlucky . You should 've come a few days later . Just think of it as bad luck . What are you doing ? Let go ! We decided to end it all ! We had no choice ! The young ones resisted . What else could we do Except pretend that none of it ever happened ? It 'll hurt more if you move . Well are you going to attack or what ? ! You two , get out of here ! Kill them ! What ? What is all this ? How did things come to this ? People killing each other ? Saying it had to be . Everyone went mad . Pretend it never happened , they said . Pretend it never happened . Pretend it never happened . Pretend it never ... What happened here ? Hell if I know ! Just as I thought . The dragon 's pulse is irregular . Dragon 's pulse ? What does that mean ? I 'll tell you ! It 's an underground artery for magma disrupted by tectonic activity ! Volcanoes ? What the hell else could it be ? It screwed up the magnetic field ! What ? Okay , look . The Earth is like one big monster magnet ! A shift in the earth 's crust upsets the Earth 's magnetic balance . Oddly enough , one result is that it wreaks neurological havoc on all living things ! Screw that ! You mean ? It drives people mad ? Uh-huh ! Affirmative ! He 's borderline , too ? Your problem is you don 't listen ! Look what they did to our comrades , Massacred for no reason whatsoever ! It pisses the hell out of me ! Average citizens attacking the peacekeepers there to protect them . We 're all that 's left ! You enjoyed using this , though ? Screw you ! Insanity everywhere ! Everywhere ? ! It 's like this everywhere ? Tokyo too ? The more people there are , the faster panic spreads . Blame magnetism if you like . Up yours ! It 's all Nature 's fault ! You can 't blame people for that . I 've heard many rumors . An earthquake set off a few nukes ? A huge meteor hit ? A fiery dragon ? Judgement Day ? You don 't buy that ? Too preposterous ? Damn right ! So mankind was mad even before the magnetic field went haywire ? For millennia ! This much is certain ! The world is a much different place than you thought . That 's it . Nature 's mystery runs deeper than you could ever imagine ! Vanished ! Very odd ! All this work for nothing . Where are we ? Her husband did this ! What did he do ? He was scared so he ... Your husband ? He wanted to protect the children 's minds by removing their fear surgically . Jesus ! Isn 't anyone sane ? Anyone at all ? So he was a doctor . I 've heard of him . Said he could remove the lobe that controls fear . Please ! Those children won 't mourn my passing . Please ease my pain ! Don 't ! It 'll piss him off if I do it . Do it ! She wants you to . Kill me . Do as she says ! Medicine ! Find medicine ! Where you going ? Saved by the bell . Why ? Your mother just died , you know ? You act like nothing happened ! Cry for her ! Your mother 's gone ! Damn it ! Say something ! Circumstance ... brought you two together ? So you stayed together , right ? But why ? You thought we would just save you for nothing ? Then why did you save us ? Because I saw some value in it . What is this ? Stick out your tongue ! Suck on this ! Hold it ! Knock if off , will ya ? Get a grip , man ! You prefer him , don 't you ? I suppose he 's more your type ? Enough ! Have it your way ! We dont wan 't your sorry DNA for posterity anyway . Don 't move ! Don 't be embarrassed ! Shut up ! One more move and I 'll ... Why 'd you shoot him ? Magnetic field . You 're right ! This won 't do ! Why add to the destruction ? We must strengthen our species ! Please , no ! Stop it ! Please ! I beg of you ! Please don 't kill me ! Please ! I 'll shoot ! I will ! I 'll shoot you ! I will ! Teru ! Teru ! Teru ! Stop the car ! Stop it ! Thank God ? Sato-san ! Sato-san ! Sato-san ! Sato-san ! Teru ? Thank God . Are we still alive ? I think so . Why ? Not him , too ? I didn 't figure this guy would be one to die . How funny ! Serves him right , but why ? Why am I still alive ? I can 't bear it ! Food distribution has begun in certain parts of Tokyo . Welcome , everyone to wonderful Tokyo . Welcome . How much further is it to Tokyo , do you think ? Not that there 's anyone to see . Nobody . They died when I was in junior high . My parents , that is . It was a car accident . When I look at him I can 't believe he feels nothing . No sense of loss ? It 's unforgivable . But , I suppose when you think about it , with all that 's happened , he 's really better off ? The way he is ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so pathetic ! And weak ! And useless ! Just alive . But I promise , I promise we 'll make it home together ! Thank you . Excuse me . Why did you save us ? I said why did you save us ? We were flying low to avoid the ash higher up in the air . You were just lucky we saw you . But you could 've flown on ? It 's his penance for killing so many ! I was just trying to survive ! Right on ! You said it , man ! Do you know anything about Tokyo ? What 's become of it ? Haven 't you heard the radio ? They say there 's order there . And food ! Lots of emergency rations underground ! Someone found them . In Tokyo , we can survive . Really ? See for yourself . We 'll be there in 20 minutes . What 's going on ? Ash in the engine ! It 's stalling ! I 'll fly lower ! We must get there ! Let me off ! Let me off ! Keep it together ! Let me off ! Close the door ! Yuriko ! Don 't move ! Hurry up and close the door ! Someone , close the door ! Teru ! Teru ! Stabilize the chopper ! I 'm trying ! Sato-san ! Teru ! Teru ! No ! Teru ! Teru ! Sato-san . Nobuo . Perhaps it 's easier to be consumed by the darkness ... to not feel anything ... remember nothing . I 'm home . At least I think it is ? I 'm home , right ? Where 's my souvenir ? How was the trip ? The faster panic spreads ... The dragon 's pulse is irregular . A huge meteor ? A fiery dragon ? Judgement Day ? A shift in the earth 's crust upsets the Earth 's magnetic balance . So mankind was mad even before the magnetic field went haywire . For millennia ! Embrace the darkness . We 've got to emmbrace the darkness . Wait ! Hey ? You 're alive . It 's me ! I saw the crashed chopper so I thought everyone had died ! What about Sato-san ? Is she still alive ? You 're wasting your time . It 's not just them , everyone 's like that . I take it you saw the streets And the butchering that took place there ? Must 've been horrific . Then they found this stored here , underground . Just for such an occasion . Eat this food and you 'll become like that child . Liberated from fear ! You feel nothing ? Pathetic , isn 't it ? Right , Yuriko ? Hey , when did you die . Here . It tastes pretty good . Sample Sato-san ? Sato-san ! Sato-san ! Sato-san ! Sato-san ? Not you too , Sato-san ? Damn it ! Why ? Sato-san ? Teru ? Sato-san . Teru ? Your family ? I 'm sorry . You didn 't eat it ? No . I didn 't want to be like that child . If I can 't cry , or laugh , then what 's the point ? I wanted to be able to cry , to think about you . You 're all I have left . If you had died and left me all alone , I would have been able to cry ! Sato-san . Teru . I was frightened . Sato-san was the only person crying in that place . Who would invent such a thing ? Food to numb your senses . What kind of world had they foreseen for those without it ? Let 's go ! Quickly ! Get out of here ! You came here to live ! You alright ? I 'm fine . You can 't kill us ! We 're going to survive ! What remains ahead is either hope or despair . Nobody can say which it 'll be . It 's a question for the future . Our future .

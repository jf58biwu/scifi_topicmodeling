 Fletcher Ridge , Illinois . Large enough to have a U.P.S. office ... and a driver named Jarod Harper . Very good , Broots . Any physical description ? Size , weight and color all match Jarod perfectly . And he got the job at almost exactly the same time that ... - I calculated his position . - Call Lyle . - I already have . He 's on his way . - Great . Let 's go . [ Cell Phone Rings , Beeps ] - What ? - [ Mr. Parker ] Angel . - Angel , I have to see you . - [ Whispering ] Daddy ? The junkyard near the Quentin Street Overpass , and hurry . - Daddy ! - [ Dial Tone ] You look bothered , Miss Parker . Don 't you have a bake sale to organize ? I know these are stressful times for you . That 's why I want you to have this . It 's a prayer card . I slept with it under my pillow . - That explains the grease stains . - I asked for it to be filled ... with the answers you need . - God bless . - You too . Parker ? Are you coming ? I 'll be back . - What about Jarod ? - What about Lyle ? Um , buy me some time . A few hours . [ Siren Wails ] [ Second Siren Wailing ] Ouch ! Sorry , mister . It got away from me . - Wow . This is a great car . - Thanks . - I bought it with my tooth fairy money . - " Tooth fairy " ? You know , where you put your tooth under your pillow ... the tooth fairy takes it and leaves you money . Didn 't you ever get that when you were a kid ? I wasn 't really a kid when I was a kid . Thanks , mister . [ Bell Tolling ] [ Woman ] Would you just shut up ? I don 't want to talk about this anymore . Damn it , Sarah , we don 't have a choice . Cam , we don 't need to be making these arrangements . The hell we don 't ! These people at the hospital already showed ... they don 't care whether us Larsens live or die - Billy , come on . - Cam , the doctors said - - I know what the doctors said . I know what needs to be done . - Why do you have guns ? - [ Engine Revs ] Cam ! What are you planning to do ? - I didn 't start this , Sarah . - Cameron ! - Go home ! - [ Screams ] Come on , damn it ! [ Crying ] Damn it ! Here you go . Use mine . [ Beeps , Dials ] - [ Line Ringing ] - [ Woman ] 9-1-1 . Can I help you ? Yes , ma 'am . My name is Sarah Larsen . My brothers are on the way to the hospital . They have guns . I don 't know ! Look , you just gotta do something ... before somebody gets hurt , okay ? - [ Sobs ] - [ Beeps ] I appreciate - Mister ? [ Woman On Police Radio ] All units , hostage situation at Saint Mary 's Hospital . - Men considered armed and dangerous . - [ Sirens Wailing ] [ People Clamoring ] [ Cam ] Billy , hurry up and get those windows painted . Nobody moves and nobody gets hurt ! We 're all gonna be here awhile , so just get comfortable . [ Woman On P.A. ] All medical personnel . Prepare to evacuate all non critical patients from the first floor . - How you doin ' , Pop ? - [ Machine Beeping ] [ Man ] Keep evacuating ! Everybody sit tight and wait for my command . If there 's a clear shot , you let me know . Well , that 's an interesting philosophy . Shoot first , ask questions later . - Who are you ? - Special Agent Jarod Jackson , Chicago F.B.I. I 'm the hostage negotiator . - This is my show now . - Damn ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . 36 hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Best we can figure , there 's a half a dozen people being held . Including three patients in the seized wing that could die ... in the next few hours without treatment . - Kill that alarm ! - The hostage-takers ? Billy Larsen . He 's 21 . Good kid , with no priors . Big brother Cam 's 28 . He 's a hothead ... with a sheet that goes all the way back to high school . - Weapons ? - Rifle and shotgun , according to their sister . - I 'll need her brought here as soon as possible . - Yes , sir . - They make any demands ? - Nothing yet . - What 's your read on the situation ? - You 're the big badge . - You tell me . - They 've isolated the situation ... to a specific area of the hospital where their father is a patient . My guess , it 's some sort of grievance against the hospital . - How do you figure that ? - Like you said , I 'm the big badge . Let 's go to work . This is F.B.I. Special Agent Jarod Jackson . I want to talk to you about your demands . If you 've got something on your minds ... now might be a good time to discuss it . This is between us and the hospital . You 've got your father in there . Innocent people who need medical attention . Neither one of us want anyone to die here today . So why don 't you tell me what you want ... - and we can end this thing . - [ Cam ] I want you to write this down . $ 41,342.17 . Not a penny more , not a penny less . Over and out . All right . I 'll see what I can do . Need to establish a direct phone line into that room . - Yes , sir . - What if they don 't answer ? Hell , they could have already killed somebody , and we 'd never know it . Where can I get blueprints of this building ? - I can get ' em here 10 ten minutes . - All right . I need a fiber-optics video camera , with a transmitter and microwave intercept . Hold on , Einstein . This town has two red lights , three hardware stores . - Meaning ? - Meaning , if you want a hammer , I can help you out . You want to build a nuclear reactor , you 're outta luck . - This town have an electronics store ? - That we got . I 'm going to make a list of things I need . Get these to me , A.S.A.P. [ Engine Revving ] [ Beeping ] [ BabyCrying ] [ Crying Continues ] Angel . - Ugh . - You weren 't followed ? - Daddy , you look - - Oh , I 'm sorry to scare you . Come on . Come on . Come on . - Daddy , what the hell is going on ? - Come on , come on . Come on back here . Sit down . - [ Panting ] - Where have you been ? Underground . This is the last place they 'd look . [ Panting ] Now , look . There 's a strongbox in SL-22 . - In a panel behind the fire hose . - Strongbox ? Yeah . It 's filled with cash . Bring it to me . But don 't tell anybody . Life and death , understand ? - No , I don 't . - Brigitte and I had to leave our hiding place . I need the money to last us a few weeks . - Daddy , if I knew why you were running - - [ Cell Phone Rings ] - [ Beeps ] - What ? Bad news . Jarod never showed up for his shift at the U.P.S. job . - We missed him ! - Lyle ? He 's looking for you , and he is peeved . What else is new ? I want you to keep searching for Jarod . - I 'll be back as soon as I can . - [ Kissing Sound ] Daddy ? [ Woman ] This whole thing is gonna turn into a nightmare . Nobody 's gonna want to get treated at the O.K. Corral . - Who are you ? - Rebecca Simons , hospital administrator . Dr. Stephen Franklin , chief cardiologist . They spoke to the Larsen boys before they pulled their guns . - I 'm listening . - Family brought their father . - Jake Larsen . - He was complaining of chest pains . - Family thought it might be a heart attack . - He was admitted to C.C.U. ? Yes , yes . I diagnosed him with a type of arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation . It 's painful , but it 's not life-threatening . - Apparently , his sons had a different opinion . - Maybe I should have kept ... Mr. Larsen one more night to ease their minds . Does this figure mean anything to you , Doctor ? $ 41,342.17 ? - Not in particular . What is it ? - [ Sighs ] That 's a good question . Agent Jackson , there are patients in there ... who will die in the next few hours if left untreated . [ Sighs ] Excuse me . Sarah , my name is Jarod . - The man with the telephone . - I 'm with the F.B.I. I think it 's safe to say that neither one of us woke up this morning expecting to be here . - [ Sighs ] - I realize that you 're going through ... a very difficult time right now . But I have to understand : Why are your brothers doing this ? Look , I want to end this thing without anybody getting hurt . But the truth is , I can only hold those men off for so long . Move over there . Get that door . Everything was always pretty crazy in our family . But things seemed to really come undone after Mom died . - Especially for Cam . - Your mom was here , at this hospital . Same room where Daddy is . [ Sighs ] She was so sick when they sent her home ... and ... she died a few days later . And now your father 's here . Look , my brothers may be doing the wrong thing ... but they must be doing it for the right reason - and I am not gonna help you kill them for it . Agent Jackson . Got the equipment you wanted . All right . Let 's see what 's going on in there . - [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] - [ Moaning ] - What are we gonna do , Cam ? - I 'm thinking ! [ Softly ] I 'm thinking . [ Billy ] I hope you know what you 're doin ' , big brother . - I don 't get it . - Sometimes it helps to be a fly on the wall . Or in this case , the airvent . Grab those blueprints . This will give us a better sense of the space where the hostages are being held ... windows , exits - [ Deputy ] I 'll be damned . I could use this to get a clean shot . I have men on the roof , next to the seized wing . Isn 't it your job to consider everybody 's safety ? My job is to save the lives of those civilians inside ! If I hesitate , and one innocent person dies , it 's my fault . I won 't make that mistake . The sheriff seems a little on edge . [ Deputy ] He has his reasons . [ Jake ] Cam ! What the hell do you think you 're doin ' ? - [ Cam ] I know what I 'm doin ' , Pop . - You wouldn 't be here ... if your mama was still alive . Well , she 's not , and I am . Stop talkin ' . Just get some rest . Man , there are guns and badges all over the place down there . [ Sighs ] Well , what the hell did you think was gonna happen ? Come in here with guns , they 'd leave a parking ticket on our car ? Just keep lookout . Sheriff says , kill the air and the lights . [ Motors Decelerating ] You two get down ! - [ Jake Gasping ] - What now ? [ Phone Ringing ] - Yeah . - Cam . This is Agent Jackson . Turn the lights and air back on ! All right , I 'll give you what you want , and you give me a couple of hostages . - Why should I trust you ? - You have my word . No harm will come to you or your brother , as long as we keep talking . It 's going to get really warm in there . Now , do we have a deal ? Cam . You can trust me . - Cam ? Talk to me . - [ Gunshot ] Get down ! Everybody get down ! [ Screaming ] [ Gunshots Continue ] I had Cam 's trust until your sniper got trigger-happy . Hey ! Cam Larsen isn 't a man who can be trusted . He incited a riot while he was in prison . Did you know that ? The guards were beating the prisoners , and they were convicted on brutality charges . Did you know that ? I got Cam on the line . - Cam . - Are you guys crazy ? I had nothing to do with that shooting , I swear to you . Look , i-it 's important that I come in there and speak to you face-to-face . I 'm not here to talk ! I 'm here to save my dad 's life . Understand ? It 's too hot in here . Turn on the air , now . Yes . Yes , I will turn the air conditioning back on , I promise . - Now , can I come in there ? - [ Sighs Deeply ] Okay . But just you . Unarmed . Ten minutes . - All right . Ten minutes . - [ Line Clicks ] - Those are Cam 's kids . - I had them brought in . - To get under his skin ? - To get into his heart . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - What ? - Where are you ? - Never mind . Did you find Jarod ? I was scanning police chatter in Fletcher Ridge ... and I came across a hostage negotiation situation there at a hospital . - F.B.I. involvement . - And ? It sounded like something that Jarod would be drawn to ... - so I-I contacted the Chicago office of the F.B.I. - - Let me guess . - No F.B.I. involvement . - If there were any agents on the job there ... they would have come from the Chicago office , and they hadn 't sent anybody . [ Groans ] He never left town . Get the jet ready , and I 'll be back as soon as I can . - [ Softly ] What about Lyle ? - Lyle who ? [ Hangs Up Receiver , Beeps ] Hmm . I love ice cream . [ Smacking Lips ] I want to help your dad , but I 'm going to need your help to do it . [ Siren Wailing ] Last night , Daddy was yelling at Billy and Sarah . - He was angry ? - He said the hospital was gonna send Grandpa Jake home to die . Just like they did Grandma . He said they were murderers . - Murderers . - [ Sighs ] - Looks like you just lost a tooth . - It fell out . Are you going to put it under your pillow ? For the tooth fairy ? - Tonight . - Wow . - How much you figure you 're gonna get ? - Mm - - Maybe a dollar . - A dollar . How would you ... - [ Helicopter Whirring ] - like to make five ? [ Helicopter Passing By ] It 's Agent Jackson . I 'm coming in , and I 'm unarmed . [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] Check him out . He 's clean . Could have got somebody killed , shootin ' in here like that . That was a mistake . That officer has been removed from the line . We 're not exactly talking about an elite police force out there . - [ Cam ] Tell me about it . - So , are you ready to end this thing , Cam ? Get your father taken care of ? I know you care about him . That 's why you 're doing this . - You don 't know nothin ' . - Why don 't you explain it to me ? $ 41,342.17 . - That 's an odd price to place on somebody 's life . - It 's not my price . It 's theirs . - [ Moaning ] - Oh , she 's gettin ' worse . - Hey-hey ! - So , what are you gonna do ? You gonna keep her here and let her die ? Her life for your father 's , is that it ? - Cam , maybe we should let her go , huh ? - Billy , shut up ! - [ Gasps ] - You 're not a killer , Cam . You let this woman die , and you 're going to spend the rest of your life in prison . You and Billy , here . - Think about your children . - My kids . - They won 't understand this . - Can 't believe how much your little boy looks like you . - You talked to my boy ? - It 'sprocedure . Oh , Cody . He asked me to give you this . [ Helicopter Whirring ] - So , how much do you want me to leave for him ? - How much ? Money . From the tooth fairy . Right . Tooth fairy . You got a dollar ? - All I got 's a five . - Give it here . - You 're gonna give him five bucks for a baby tooth ? - Just give me the money . You walk outta here now , you can still put this money under your son 's pillow yourself . I can 't leave him . [ Sighs ] Man , you don 't get it , do you ? This isn 't just about my father . It 's about every person out there who is sick ... and deserves to be treated with dignity . They 're gonna send this man home . Does he look like he should go home to you ? - [ Gasping ] - At least , give me a hostage . - [ Scoffs ] - You gotta work with me here , Cam . There are a lot of people out there looking for any reason to shoot you ... and your little brother over here . [ Woman Breathing With Diffilculty , Coughing ] All right . Take that lady . Take her . Help him . Unhook her , and get her out of here . - What about the others ? - One at a time . Allright , allright , allright . One at a time . You 're doing a good thing here , Cam . [ Chattering On Police Radio ] If some of those patients don 't get treatment real soon , we could have a disaster here . - Meaning ? - Maneuver Cam to a window . One shot , and it 's over . Why is it that you feel that bullets are the only option ? One shot . Deputy , may I have a word with you ? [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] [ Spitting ] - What 's your name ? - Lindsay . L-Lindsay Tyler . Shouldn 't bite your nails , Lindsay . It 's a bad habit . - I know . - Y-You don 't remember me , do you ? - Should I ? - Cindy Perkins ? Junior high school , Sadie Hawkins dance - I asked you to dance once , and you said yes ? - [ Sighs ] - I had stringy hair , braces - Yeah , yeah . You chased me around the gym all night . What was that , 10 , 15 years ago ? You kept asking the band to play your favorite song . - " Dream Weaver . " [ Chuckles ] - That 's a damn fine song . [ Helicopter Passing Overhead ] You know , my dad died of heart problems . Th-That 's why I went into nursing . Your father sort of reminds me of my dad . [ Jake Coughing ] Look , Cindy - [ Sighs Deeply ] I 'm sorry about all this . I never meant to - - Cam ? - [ Alarm Beeping ] - Cam , come here . - Go , go , go , go , go , go , go . He 's not breathing ! - [ Ringing ] - I need a doctor in here now ! Now ! All right , Cam . I 'll send one in . Get your gear . - [ Doctor ] No . - What did you say ? Those men are heavily armed , and they 've threatened the lives of innocent people . Unless you can assure me of my safety , I 'm not going anywhere . - Get the lights back on in that room . - What are you gonna do ? Agent Jackson . Agent Jackson ! Cam , it 's Agent Jackson . I 'm coming in . - I asked for a doctor ! - Cam , he 's going into cardiac arrest ! - Let him in , Cam . - [ Alarm Buzzing ] - We didn 't come here to kill our own father . - [ Alarm Continues ] - [ Assisted Breathing ] - Come in ! - Easy , easy ! - Where is the doctor ? [ Jarod ] There isn 't a doctor available . I can handle this . - [ Exhales ] - [ Huffs ] I hope you can handle this . 'Cause if my old man dies , so do you . [ One Long Beep ] - [ Cindy ] He 's been flat for 15 seconds . - [ Electrical Whining ] - Paddles charged ? - Clear . - [ Electrical Thumping ] - [ Cindy ] Nothing . 25 seconds . - Talk to him . - What ? I need him to fight . Tell him a story from your past . Something you did together . Talk to him . Clear . - [ Thumps ] - Nothing . - We 're running out of time . Talk to him . - [ Cindy ] 40 seconds . Dad , remember when I was five years old ... how you used to take me hunting up near Patchett Lake ? I 'm going to 360 joules . Keep talking . - [ Paddles Charging ] - Used to wake me up early , while it was still dark out . I used to hate gettin 'up so early , but you said it was important ... - to get out before the sun . - [ Jarod ] Clear ! You told me that a sunrise in the woods was as close to God as a breathing ' man could get . - [ Paddles Whining ] - Remember when you said that ? Remember that , Dad ? - [ Cindy ] One minute . - Clear . - [ Thumping ] - [ Gasping ] - Come on , old man . Fight ! Don 't give up ! Fight . - [ Cindy ] 70 seconds . - Don 't leave us , please . - [ Paddles Charging ] - We need you . - I 'm gonna hit him again . Clear ! Come on , you can fight this ! Come on , Pop . We need you . Cody and Kerry need their grandpa . If we don 't get him back quick , there could be permanent damage . Don 't die on me , Dad . Hang in there . Come on . Don 't die on me , Dad . - Come on , pop ! - I 'm getting a pulse . [ Steady Beeping ] They really train ' em up there at the F.B.I. Academy . [ Police Chattering On Radio ] Let 's get a closer look . [ Whirring , Banging ] - What the hell was that ? - What the hell happened ? - I don 't know . The signal went dead . - [ Panting ] Look , Cam . You 've made all the right choices up till now . Let me take another hostage out of here . - Okay . Yeah . You , Cindy . Go home . - No . - What ? - I don 't leave until you do . For my father . I-I 'll go . - I 've got to get that picture back . - [ Jarod , Indistinct ] - [ Deputy ] We 've still got sound , Sheriff . - [ Whirring , Banging ] What the hell is this ? You 've been watchin ' us the whole time ! I should blow you away right now ! I knew I couldn 't trust you people ! - [ Moaning ] - No , no ! No . Cam . Not like this . [ Helicopter Whirring ] All right . Get out . Take her with you . No more talking ! Just get out ! - You all right ? - Yeah . Please take care of her . - Are you out of your mind ? - Hey , it was an accident ! You could have gotten all of us killed in there . We can 't keep pushing him . - Why can 't you get that through your head ? - I 've had a bellyful of you . - Oh , yeah ? And what is that supposed to mean ? - You 're the big badge . You figure it out . [ Keypad Beeping ] - [ Line Ringing , Clicking ] - Alice ? Get me the number for the F.B.I. office in Chicago . [ Sighs ] [ Sydney ] I doubt you 'll find Miss Parker searching through her desk . [ Broots ] We saw her this morning . I think she had some errands to run . She didn 't say where she was going ? You know your sister . You know she dances to the beat of a different drummer . - [ Slams Book Closed ] - So I 've noticed . You two wouldn 't lie to me , would you ? So , a-anybody see the , uh , Redskins game this weekend ? Agent Jackson . Any idea when I might be allowed back in my office ? - No idea . - Oh . [ Sighs ] That 's very impressive , the way you handled that code situation . I didn 't have much of a choice , did I ? Tell me something . How are insurance claims processed at this hospital ? In the middle of a hostage situation , and you 're wondering about billing procedure ? I 'm just curious . For instance , an H.M.O. claim . H.M.O. ' s rely on the information provided by the attending physician . So a particular medical procedure would be approved or denied ... - based upon your recommendation . - Yeah , that . And the recommendation of the facilities administrator . - Rebecca Simons . - In the case of this hospital , yes . What percentage of major surgeries have been denied at this hospital ? - [ Sighs ] Oh , I-I don 't know . - Take a guess . [ Stammering ] I-I don 't know . Fifty percent ? Sixty-eight percent : 11 percentage points higher than the national average . - Why do you think that is ? - Maybe there are just a lot of healthy people in this town . - Maybe . - [ Helicopter Whirring ] [ Dialing Phone ] - [ Line Clicking ] - Uh , we need to talk . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Scoffs ] You look like hell . [ Chuckling ] That 's the way it is when you 're dyin ' . Got yourself in a real mess here , boy . Like everything else in my life . Look , maybe I didn 't do the things I should have when you were small . Hell , I - I was makin ' it up as I went . But I taught you kids right from wrong . I did that . - I 'm tryin ' to save you , Dad . - Why ? Because we 're a family . I never knew my own old man . Not more than a smack in the head now and then . I just did the best that I could , and - [ Sobs ] When your mama died - I think a little bit of me went too . Guess we 've been fightin the same pain . [ Sobbing ] I miss her . Every day . Me too , Pop . [ Exhales ] [ Jarod ] $ 41,342.17 . This is the exact amount this hospital charges for heart bypass surgery . - What are you talkin ' about ? - Jake Larsen has sky-high levels of creatine kinase enzyme ... - in his blood . - So ? - His fingertips are blue from lack of oxygen . - I still don 't follow . He has heart disease . He 's headed for a massive heart attack . His only chance of survival is heart bypass surgery . The same surgery this hospital denied him . [ Sighs ] - Who the hell are you ? - Excuse me ? I called the F.B.I. Nobody 's ever heard of an Agent Jarod Jackson . Well , it 's a big agency . Maybe you talked to the wrong person . If any of those people in there die , it 's on your head . You understand what that means , to have somebody 's blood on your hands ? As a matter of fact , I do . And so do you . Your deputy told me about that hostage situation a year ago at the grocery store . The way you lured that perpetrator into the doorway ... and hesitated to take the kill shot . Did he tell you how that same hostage-taker took his gun ... and shot to death a 15-year-old stock boy ? Did he describe the sick feeling I get every time I see that boy 's parents on the street ? - You did what you thought was the right thing to do . - And an innocent boy ... lost his life . That 's the blood I have on my hands ... Agent Jackson . [ Siren Wailing ] Certainly has been a long day , hasn 't it ? - Agent Jackson . - I was wondering if you and I could have a little talk . Oh , well , the truth is , I 'm late for a meeting . Perhaps later . I know about the cover-up concerning Jake Larsen 's coronary disease . But what could an H.M.O. possibly have to gain by such a cover-up ? I saw you and Dr. Franklin arguing in the parking lot . I know what 's going on . We could talk about it here in private , or we could go downtown ... and talk under the glare of the television cameras . It 's up to you . Is it just for the money ? Or is it something more personal ? I see the way you and Dr. Franklin are together . My girlfriends and I ... used to dream about meeting a doctor . Falling in love , and living happily ever after . I actually believed that 's the way it would be for Stephen and me . Your signature is on the release forms for all the patients in question . I made my decisions based on Franklin 's recommendations . I looked the other way in one case , next thing I knew , I was - All for money . Franklin was getting kickbacks from the H.M.O. ' s for not doing expensive surgeries . By denying certain procedures to critically ill patients ... he saves the H.M.O. hundreds of thousands of dollars . - And makes a nice percentage . - I swear to you ... I didn 't know about Jake Larsen until his sons took over the hospital . Franklin said that you questioned him , and he threatened to expose me ... if I said anything , and - I was afraid . Not half as afraid as those patients who were sent home to die . - The key you gave me doesn 't work . - Really ? Huh . Must have given you the wrong one . Here , let me try this one . - [ Key Turning Lock ] - Yep . That works . [ Chuckling ] Angel , I 'm sorry I had to drag you into this . " Baby Parker . " Wh-What was that ? Oh , it 's nothing . - It looked like a medical record . - It 's ancient history . - It is mine , or Lyle 's ? - It doesn 't matter ! Trust me . Some day , when I have more time , I 'll explain everything to you . - But right now , I need your gun . - My gun ? This is about that hit out on you . Yeah , the bastards are closin ' in . - Who ordered it ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . I do know ... this ... is the only thing that really matters . It 's the future of our family . It 's the heir to the Parker name , and it 's growing inside Brigitte . The baby 'll be here soon . - What else can I do ? - Well , the key is still Jarod . Bring him back , and it 'll be just like it was . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing ] - [ Beeping ] - I 'm on my way . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Phone Ringing ] - Yeah ? - Dr. Franklin ? Agent Jackson . Cam and Billy Larsen have tapped into hospital records ... and are trying to find information about patients who were denied care . - Can you cut them off ? - We tried . I suggest I download everything . I wouldn 't want you to lose any patient records . No ! No , I 'll , uh - I 'll handle that . I-I know which files are important . Can I get back in my office yet ? I don 't think that 's a good idea . Things are still pretty dangerous up here . I couldn 't assure your safety . Dr. Franklin ? - Dr. Franklin . - I 'm on my way up . If you think that 's best . [ Coughs ] - [ Gunshots ] - [ Glass Breaking ] - What happened ? - I was shot ! The Larsen boys . They 're crazy ! They 're coming down the hallway . They say they know who 's responsible for trying to kill their father . I 've gotta get out of here . [ Grunts ] - Doctor ? - I can 't breathe ! [ Panting ] My heart ! [ Groans ] [ Panting ] What 's happening to me ? The same thing that you let happen to Jake Larsen . You 're having a massive heart attack . [ Gasping ] Wha - What have you done to me ? I laced your keyboard with a tricyclic antidepressant . It 's absorbed through the fingertips . Speeds up the heart 's rhythm . That 's why I faked getting shot ... told you that the Larsen boys were coming down the hallway - I wanted to scare you . You see , adrenaline , it really increases the effects of the drug . - [ Gasping ] Why ? - Because of what you did to Jake Larsen . Because of the drugs you gave him to cover up the symptoms of his coronary disease . - [ Groaning ] Who are you ? - I 'm everyone . I 'm no one . If you tell me the truth ... I can bring your heart back to normal . Look , we 're all on the same side here - [ Grunting ] There 's no reason to let this become a problem . Oh , it became a problem when you aligned yourself with an H.M.O ... . that cared more about profits than taking care of patients . God , Larsen wouldn 't have survived another year no matter what we did . That is not the point ! You 're a doctor ! Your job is to give care , not take it away ! - [ Groans In Pain ] - That cyanosis must really be setting in right now . You should really seek treatment . Or you can die within minutes . - Please ! Please ! - How many people ? How many people did you let die so you could stuff your pockets ? [ Grunts ] All right , I took kickbacks from the H.M.O. ' s ... to send patients home - now please , help me ! - Please ! - Sorry , Doc . But your claim has been denied . No ! No . [ Sobbing , Groaning ] [ Chattering On Police Radio ] - Is he really gonna die ? - I just laced his keyboard with trigoxin . He has nothing more than a really bad case of heartburn . And he 'll probably lose bladder control for a couple of days . [ Chattering On Police Radio ] [ Grunting ] - [ Sighs ] - [ Siren Wailing ] I 'm gonna drop some of the charges against the brothers . Let the judge deal with the rest . Considering the circumstances , I think they 've suffered enough for one family . I think you 're right . Thank you for keeping me from doing something stupid . I guess we can 't let the mistakes of our past ruin our future . Will you excuse me , Sheriff ? Excuse me . Are you from the Chicago office ? - Are you a reporter ? - Blue Cove Gazette . Have you been involved during the entire crisis ? No , I just arrived on the scene . There was another negotiator involved . Our source from your Chicago office ... - tells us he was an impostor . - That 's what we 've been told . - And where is he ? - No idea . I don 't know how he did it , but witnesses say he really knew what he was doing . Excuse me . It 's your fault we missed him . [ Mr. Parker ] Now don 't tell anybody . Life and death , understand ? Someday , when I have more time , I 'll explain everything to you . Well , the key is still Jarod . Bring him back , and it 'll be just like it was . You 're gonna be held accountable for this , Parker . I know . Let 's go home .

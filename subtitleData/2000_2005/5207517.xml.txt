 [ MAN GROWLING ] [ VOICES SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] Why don 't you stare at this for a little while , you ugly bastard ? - What are you doing here ? - I 'm taking the specimen . You can 't . I haven 't prepped the cryostasis chamber . [ SCOFFS ] I don 't want him frozen , Rowan . I want him soft . - We 've already discussed this . WIMMER : Yeah . Well , I had to go over your head . I 'm moving him to our Scranton facility . You can 't risk transporting him through open country . - This isn 't open for discussion . His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue I mean , it just cries out for more research . And you 'll risk the deaths of innocent civilians if he escapes ? Yes . But I 'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his men can handle the transfer just fine . - Sergeant ? - Everything is under control , ma 'am . - Dr. Wimmer , please . - Rowan , he 's no longer your problem . Can we get that rag off him ? What the hell ? [ GASPING ] [ GROANING ] [ DOOR BANGS ] ROWAN : Aah ! Oh , my God ! [ GROANING ] Get out of here . What happened ? I 'm sorry .

Someone want to tell me what that is ? It 's like a big kind of frozen storage thing . Probably a cryostasis unit . I 'd guess early port series . Kay-Em ? Quadroport 11 . Manufactured in 2010 . Precise historic records are inconsistent . - Anyone thinking what I 'm thinking ? - Open it up . - What the hell is that ? - Humanoid . Organic composition is unclear . Can someone tell me what 's on his face ? Uh , some kind of 20th-century carbon filtration unit ? - It 's a hockey mask . - Very good , Tsunaron . - What 's a hockey mask ? - Facial armor . Used in a sport outlawed in 2024 . Amazing . Absolute museum quality . - Are you paying attention , Azrael ? - Yeah . Well , don 't touch anything . [ HUMS ] Guys , we got another body here . - Kay-Em ? - She 's perfectly preserved . Cell crystallization is at 25 percent . Twenty-five percent ? Suggest extensive nanotech and phase one cell reconstruction . Wait a minute , are you saying that we can bring her back to life ? - Yes . But she is deteriorating . Opening the door has compromised her hibernation . Lou , get ready for dust-off . We have a priority evac . - Copy that , ready in five . - Not five , now . Ah . What the ... ? - Look out .

Get the sarge on the horn . BRIGGS : Did you hear ? Division 4 just entered the occupied zone . - Casualties ? - Minimal . I 'd love to know how we got this screwed-up gig . Yeah , well , I didn 't join the corps to become a freaking babysitter . Brodski here . KICKER [ OVER RADIO ] : Sarge , we found a viable . - Say again ? - We found two bodies in deep cryostasis . The Kay-Em unit thinks we can resuscitate the female . Female ? - Yeah . - Crutch , do you copy ? [ SNORING ] BRODSKI [ OVER RADIO ] : Crutch , do you read me ? Crutch , wake the hell up . - What ? BRODSKI : They 're on their way back . Prepare for docking and power up the lab . Mm . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Whatever . [ YAWNS ] LOU : So , what does she look like ? - She 's cute . - Yeah , and single . - Mm-hm . [ LOU LAUGHING ] I 'm so lonely . We need to get her to the lab . - You think you can bring her back ? - We 'll find out , sergeant . You 're not gonna bring him back , are you ? No , it 's impossible . - Oh , shit . I forgot my arm . - Yeah , here you go , dumb-ass . Heh . Hi , hand . - Any idea how long she 's been down ? - Four-point-five-five centuries . Must 've been one hell of a wake-up call . - I 'm bitchy as hell when I wake up . - Did you just wake up ? LOWE : Kinsa . - Ahh .

Once we 're in the clear , I 'd like to check your circuits . - Oh , I 'll bet you would . - It isn 't like that . [ JANESSA CHUCKLES ] - Adrienne , good . I need you in Lab 2 . - You found something ? - Two viables . - In what condition ? Perfect . Attempting reanimation with one . What can I do ? - You , Stoney , Kinsa- - - Ah . They 're second year . - They 'll slow me down . - Walk them through it . Run a complete structural scan , log them in , put them in stasis . - I 'll check back with you later . - Fine . LOWE : Where are we ? - The board 's all green , teach . - N-2 's warm and ready . LOWE : Good . Kay-Em , begin stabilizing any cellular fractures . Yes , professor . Janessa , I need a full scan . Glycerol levels , cerebral perfusion , the whole works . - I live to serve . - Let 's see what we 're dealing with here . Decrystalization of the membranes is now at 32 percent . Good . Somebody get those clothes off her . Oh , I got it . I got it . Honestly . Waylander , where 's her diffusion barriers ? WAYLANDER : Uh ... - Seventeen and stable . - Here we go . Stay still or you 'll end up getting an elbow where your wrist should be . Specimen 4420 found in Sector 3930 L on Earth prime . Subject discovered in complete cryo-suspension . [ AZRAEL GRUNTING ] - How 's it going ? AZRAEL : Good , man . What 's up ? [ AZRAE L GROANS ] STONEY : Hey , where do you want this ? - On the specimen table . - Hi , baby . STONEY : Hey , gorgeous . [ KINSA GIGGLES ] Initiating scan . - Mm . Smart and sexy . KINSA : Mm . Professor , take a look at this guy 's scan . - Amazing . - How does he function with a brain that small ? - Way manages . - That 's very funny . - He 's a big boy .

There was a leak in the cryo unit and ... - Was it contained ? LOWE : It was contained . But when the cryo unit ruptured , you didn 't escape it . It put you into stasis . For how long ? The year is 2455 . Now , I know this is a huge shock , but you 're gonna be safe here . You 're aboard Grendel , a class-four catamaran transport ship . We 're on our way back home and you 're gonna be just fine . 2455 ? That 's over 400 years . Secure line . Perez , Dieter . Solaris Research Station . Connect . [ COMPUTER BEEPING ] Lowe , you bastard . We 've hit the mother lode . - Do you know what time it is ? - I don 't care . We 've got a gold mine . A box of DVDs is not a gold mine . I 've told you , I can 't move them . Just look at the file . Two 400-year-old frozen specimens . One well preserved . The other one- - Are you ready for this ? - -Up and walking around . Four hundred years old and walking around . Yeah , 455 years , to be exact . Who cares ? Who gives a shit ? People . - People will pay huge money to see her . - Let me ask you a question . Is this the first person you 've reanimated ? Of course not . How many people are out there today walking around thawed out and looking good ? - Hundreds . - Thousands . Maybe , but not 450 years old . She 's nearly twice as old as anyone on the planet . Two-fifty , 450 , what 's the difference ? Doctor , a hundred years ago when reanimation was more unpredictable , sure , maybe . But now it 's old news . Damn it . I need money . Oh , I know , I know . The other viable is marked " Voorhees . " That 's not Jason Voorhees , is it ? - What do you know about him ? - Jason Voorhees . He killed nearly 200 people and simply disappeared without a trace . Why , to the right buyer , he could be worth a fortune . I 've got him frozen here on the ship . - You work out a list of ownership ? - No list . He 's my find . He 's mine . - What about your students ? - Well , they 're students . The educational experience will be enough . Doctor , doctor , you are one son of a bitch . Soon to be one rich son of a bitch .

Can I do anything else for you ? Wanna tell me what happened down there ? I take it being stabbed and frozen wasn 't part of your plan . I 'm a ... I was a project leader at Crystal Lake Research . - The subject was Jason Voorhees . - Jason Voorhees ? Notorious murderer ? We executed him for the first time in 2008 . - For the first time ? - Mm-hm . We tried everything . Electrocution , gas , firing squad . We even hung him once . Nothing worked . It was decided that if we couldn 't terminate him , we 'd contain him . Cryogenic stasis . Freeze him until we could figure out what to do . - Seems sensible . - I thought so . But unfortunately , some people who were too smart for their own good felt that a creature that couldn 't be killed was simply too valuable to just file away . In the end , it always comes down to money . How do you thank someone who gives you back your life ? Well , you 're gonna be alive for a long time . We 'll figure out something , heh . Why don 't you just admit it ? You want me . I could never be with a girl whose balls are bigger than mine . Guys , our star patient is back . Rowan , this is Tsunaron and Janessa . - Hi . TSUNARON : Hi . Hi . I see that my clothes fit okay . Oh , these are yours . They 're great . Thank you . Whoa , heh . - What are those ? - These are Janessa 's love children . Ha-ha-ha . You see , now , it is that wit of yours that is what repels all human females . LOWE : Of course , you 've met Sergeant Brodski . ROWAN : Yes . Hi again . - Hi . And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14 , Tsunaron 's little lovebot . Easy , Janessa . Kay-Em is a knowledge matrix android that I have been programming . Amazing . - She looks so real . - I am real . - Professor , where do you want this ? LOWE : Lab 2 . - Sure . ROWAN : Oh , whoa . Where did you get that ? Uh , from your friend . The big guy with the hockey mask . - You brought him on board ? - He 's in the next lab . We 're quite safe . - Safe ? - Our scans reveal him to be very dead . Could your scans be wrong ? You should just get rid of him . He 's too dangerous . Well , that would be irresponsible and foolhardy . He 's a valuable scientific artifact that must be carefully preserved . Much like yourself . He is an unstoppable killing machine . He 's not dead . Believe me . He 's definitely dead . Show me . I 'm putting us on lockdown . Attention , we have a hostile on board . [ OVER PA ] Grunt Team , report to weapons . The chick ? BRODSKI : Repeat , we have a hostile on board . Grunt Team , report to weapons . - Everyone else , get to Lab 1 . - Ugh .

[ SPINE CRACKS ] LOWE : Sergeant Brodski . - Don 't leave those kids alone . - What 's the matter with you ? - We 're less than an hour from Solaris . They have fully equipped tactical units that are more than capable of taking care of this . - I say we wait and sedate him . - I am taking this guy out . - Sergeant , I need him alive . - No , you want him alive . - What you need is to get out of my way . - Look , there are other considerations . Financial considerations . My only consideration is the safety of the people on this ship . All right , 100,000 . Two hundred . - Five . - Five ?

Yeah , that ought to do it . Such a waste . I told him to stay calm . To wait until we got to Solaris , and then we could take care of this monster . I said , don 't go in unprepared . Brodski was just too proud . [ DOOR BANGS ] [ JANESSA KINSA SCREAM ] CRUTCH : Who locked the damn door ? Somebody wanna tell me what the hell is going on ?

We 'll turn around and go back . Hang on . [ RUMBLING ] Oh , my God . - Solaris is gone . KINSA : Gone ? - It can 't be gone . - Look for yourself . It 's gone . What are we gonna do ? Lou , what sort of damage we looking at ? I 'm sending out a distress beacon . Lou ? Guys , we 've lost our entire port pontoon . The internal pressure is stable . - The main thrusters are off-line . - Life support ? - We should be okay for a while . - But he 's out there . Look , we 're gonna be fine . We 're in a high-volume traffic lane . Another ship 's gonna come by , I 'm sure of it . We 're gonna be safe here .

Um , I 'm gonna go back to my room , because Stoney 's gonna meet me there . [ LOWE SCREAMING ] Oh , man . All right , look . How do we get off this ship ? I don 't know . - Could you beam us off or something ? - Beam us off ? The shuttle . Hell , yeah . The shuttle . What about it , Crutch ? Uh , yeah , I can do prelaunch from the bridge . Good , the rest of us will head to the shuttle . We 'll start the launch list . I 'm with you , Crutch . [ KINSA GASPS ] Whoa , whoa , whoa . You know how to use that thing ? Yep . It 's just like riding a bike . - Once you learn , you never forget how . - Good . Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold . - Meet you at the shuttle bay . - See you there . Uh , what 's a bike ? Enough firepower here to level a moon . I say we pack this stuff up , head for the shuttle . What do you think ? Are we gonna make it ? Well , the statistical probability of survival is 12 percent . Twelve percent ? Can 't you come up with better odds than that ? - No . - Ugh , bullshit , Kay-Em ! That 's bullshit ! Well , preparation for launch may be a relatively simple procedure but getting there alive ? It is a problem . Are you telling me that there 's absolutely no chance for us to better our odds ? Statistical probability of survival just went up to 53 percent . Wanna go for 100 ? [ GASPS ] - He 's here . - Quiet . But if he 's in here , he 's gonna kill us and- - Quiet . One more sound and I 'll snap your neck myself . Got it ? She 's good with people . - Did you see that ? - What ? I think there 's someone still alive over there . We don 't have time for this . - Which way is the shuttle bay ? - Straight through . Go . I 'll meet you there . Just don 't wreck my pants . Come on , girl . We 're going home . CRUTCH : Aw , Lou .

Okay , let 's get us home . - Kinsa , are you there ? - Yes , ma 'am . - Crutch ? - Prepare for fuel transfers . - Cells 6 and 7 bypass . - Hydraulic lifters . Pressurized and dampened . - It 's Brodski , he 's alive . - No shit . Yeah . I can 't move him . Are Way and Crutch back ? - No , they 're still on the bridge . - I need help . Hey , guys , Brodski 's still alive , but Rowan can 't move him by herself . Go , go , go . I can handle it from here . Tell them I 'm on my way . Watch your back .

That 's affirmative , Grendel . We are reading your distress beacon . - Are you in need of assistance ? - Heh , that 's very affirmative , Tiamat . How soon can you get here ? Our situation is extremely critical . We 're 4 parsecs away , Grendel . ETA 45 minutes . We don 't have that much time . Tiamat , this is Grendel . Our hull is bleeding out . We 're gonna have a core implosion in less than 30 minutes . Do you copy ? We copy you , Grendel . Advise how you would like us to proceed . We 're just gonna end up taking them down with us . Tiamat if you can 't get here in 30 minutes , then there 's no point . What ? Are you high ? Tiamat , this is Grendel . You just ignore that last idiot , all right ? You get your ass out here , okay ? You come here and you save us . Hey , guys , why can 't we just go over here ? It 's no good . The pontoon goes , it 'll take the bridge with it . ROWAN : Not if we disconnect these walkways . WAYLANDER : You can 't just disconnect them . We could blow it up . Plenty of macro charge in the weapons hold . This could work . Tiamat , we 're gonna try something here . If you 're game , maintain your current course and speed and hopefully we 'll see you when you get here . Copy . See you in 45 minutes . - Good luck , Grendel . - Thanks . BRODSKI : Let 's blow the walkways . Come on . Let 's split up and set the charges .

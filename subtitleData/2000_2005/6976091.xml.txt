 Spider , Hubble , Nitr ... Oo Big Pink ! The gum with the breath-Freshening power of ham . And it pinkens your teeth while you chew . All right , sergeant , $ 100 worth of Pixie Stix and porno mags ... With your 5 percent military discount , comes to $ 95 . That 'll be forty cents . I believe you 're forgetting about our 5 % military discount . Well that 's only for people in the military . What ? This is the worst kind of discrimination ! The kind against me ! Alright look , our policy is ... If for any reason you 're not completely satisfied , I hate you . Okay , now I 'm mad . Full price for gum ? That dog won 't hunt , Monsignor . Hello . We 're here because we love our planet . Sign here on the dotted line , patriots . And I 'll give you your discount cards . Just out of curiousity , we can use the cards to buy gum , then immediately quit the Army , right ? You know , playing you all for chumps ? Correct . There 's no obligation . Unless , of course , war were declared . What 's that ? War were declared . Now be careful , Fry . And if you kill anyone , make sure to eat their heart ... To gain their courage . Their rich , tasty courage . I don 't want you to worry about your jobs while you 're away . That 's why I 'm firing you now . I want to enlist . My friends always die if I 'm not there to save them . Sorry . But the Army 's instituted a men-only policy . What ? It 's shameful , I agree . In the olden days , I proudly fought alongside female troops , shoulder to shoulder . Alas , after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues ... And harmless pinching , the Army decided women weren 't fit for service . Not when I 'm in charge . You know Zap , someone outta teach you a lesson . If it 's a lesson in love , watch out . I suffer from a very sexy learning disability . What do I call it , Kif ? [ groans ] Sex-Lexia . Men , you 're lucky men . Soon you 'll all be fighting for your planet . Many of you will be dying for your planet . A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet . They will be the luckiest of all . Great . We 're gonna die . And this ham gum is all bones . Now , to present the logistics of our mission ... Our commander-in-chief . Please welcome the original Gerber Baby ... Earth President Richard M. Nixon . This is the brass ring , fellas . Planet Spheron One . Cool effect ! It 's a desolate , ugly little planet ... With absolutely no natural resources or strategic value . Questions ? Why is this God-forsaken planet worth dying for ? Don 't ask me . You 're the one who 's going to be dying . Uh just so we 'll know , who 's the enemy ? A valid question ! We know nothing about their language ... Their history , or what they look like . But we can assume this : They stand for everything we don 't stand for . Also , they told me you guys look like dorks ! They look like dorks ! I 'm gonna ... What 's the matter , private ? Tent got your tongue ? Kif , write that down and send it to Humor in Uniform . Woah ! Check out that guy ! He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales . That new recruit is phenomenal , sir ! Yes . He edged out my old mark by two seconds . And 16 minutes . And 12 hours . I do plan to finish someday , Kif . Good hustle , soldier . Sorry , sir . I was still in attack mode . You know how testosterone is . As a bubbling crock-pot of male hormones , I sure do . What 's your name , private ? Lee , La , Man . La Man . Lemon ! Lee Lemon , sir . Lemon , you 're a man 's man . You 're a man 's man 's man . More importantly , your hand , while firm and masculine ... Is soft as a velvet child . What lotion do you use ? Pert and Popular , sir . Roger that . Kif , get me 10 cases of Pert and Popular . What shall I do with your Jergins , sir ? Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows . Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I 've seen in all my years of service . That young man fills me with hope . And some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing me . Hello . Now that 's a nice ros√© . So anyway , we open up the panda crate and wouldn 't you know it , the damn thing 's dead . Upchucked its bamboo . True story . Uh-huh , uh-huh . That 's whatever you were talking about for you . Mind if we sit with you ? Uh hey , why the hell would I ? We 're all guys here . Sweaty , hairy , gassy guys . Good point . I guess . You 're my kind of soldier , Lemon . A foul-mouthed , barrel-chested , beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle . So any of you fellas got a special lady back home ? Well I sorta have a thing for this girl I work with . Really ? What type is she ? You know , Blonde , or Chinese , or Cyclops ? Cyclops . Aw , she sounds sweet . But sweet girls aren 't for you , ay . You hard-fighting , hard-farting , ugly , ugly son of a ... Stop ! Stop flattering me . Ten hut ! Well , well , well . If it isn 't Lee Lemon ... The flaming star of Brannigan 's Rough Rangers . Say Lemon , do you like to read ? I just got a great book on tape . It 's about life in ancient Greece and ... Sir , the alarm ! I think I 'd better ... Don 't talk . Just go . We are now in position above Spheron One . This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon . And now for the battle plan . As you all know , the key to victory is the element of surprise . Surprise ! It 's creepy here . This is the worst part . The calm before the battle . And then the battle 's not so bad ? Oh right , I forgot about the battle . What 's happening ? Holy shoot ! Look-y ! The enemy ! They 're balls ! Charge your gun , Fry ! Right . Watch where you 're shooting , private ! You spooked Felicity . Give this to my son . You got it ! Wait . I didn 't tell you where he lives . Hey , I think your son might also like those boots . Cover us , buddy ! You got the only wounded-up positron shooter ! Fry , you emu-bellied coward ! Bender , no ! If they put me on a stamp , tell them to use the young Bender . Incoming Wounded ! All personnel , report to operating tent four ! I mean , five ! Repeat , four . Are you ready to operate doctor ? I 'd love to . But first , I have to perform surgery . I kid . I kid . Scalpel . Blood bucket . Priest . Next patient ! Leave some for the enemy to kill . Leave Doctor Zoidberg alone ! He has twice the training you do . Yeah , he 's a doctor and a butcher . Oh see , this is how it starts . First with the jokes , then comes the heavy stuff . When will the killing end ? Look at this sissy , Kif . While others were fighting and dying pointlessly ... He was hiding in a hole , wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice . That wasn 't cowardice . I 'm depromoting you , soldier . Kif , what 's the most humiliating job there is ? Being your assistant . Wrong ! Being your assistant . Private Fry , you shall henceforth serve as Kif 's assistant . That doesn 't sound too bad . You 'll speak when I tell you to , you filthy worm ! I 'm afraid he 's gone . Woah Doc , I ain 't dead ! Excuse me , I believe I 'm the doctor . Believe it all you want . That won 't make it true . This isn 't a war . It 's a murder . This isn 't a war , it 's a molder ! Bender , old buddy , hang in there ! Here lies the bravest soldier I 've seen since my mirror got grease on it . I hereby order that in Bender 's honor , he be melted down and made into a statue of himself . Slow down there Starsky , I 'm up to something here . I want this robot fixed . Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election . Damn bean-eating war hero ! Are you ready to operate , doctor ? I 'd love to . But first , I have to perform surgery . That 's my joke ! I 'll kill you ! Ah prewar scotch . Welcome , Lt. Bender . You 're looking sharp . I got wheels ! With clickity-clackers ! Damn it Kif ! Where 's the little umbrella ? That 's what makes it a scotch on the rocks ! Actually , sir ... Make me a new one . Use a brush , you dunderhead ! And mix these mixed nuts ! I see two almonds touching ! Now listen here Bender , this war is in danger of going all quagmire on me . So I am sending you on one last mission . Hot diggity daffodil ! A mission of peace . You 'll be negotiating with the aliens mysterious leaders , the Brain Balls . They 've got a lot of brains and they got a lot of chutzpa . Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator , Henry Kissinger . How are you ? Is he any good ? Looking like that , he talked his way into Jill St. John 's bed . ' Nuff said . [ Singing ] I 'm so dizzy . My head is spinning . Like a whirlpool , it never ends . A little lower . Lower . Lower . A lot lower . Too low ! Lower . [ Singing ] I 'm walking on sunshine , O-Oh ! Private Lemon ! No need to leave . My stall just became free . Maybe you should put on a towel , sir . Right ! Right . I 'm about to try the new lotion you recommended . If I should accidentally put too much on my hands , perhaps I could rub it onto you ... Brannigan ! My God , cover yourself . I didn 't live 1000 years and travel a quadrillion miles ... to look at another man 's gizmo . Uh sorry , Mr. President . I-I didn 't realize . Kif , raise him up about nipple high . Come on , Branigan . Stuff yourself into a uniform . We 've got to get off this planet before the bomb goes off . Bomb ! What bomb ? The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot . Zapp ! Zapp ! Inspect the troops later . It 's time to activate the bomb . Now ask for economic cooperation . Woah ! Excuse me . Attention ! All personnel , evacuate the planet immediately ! And not just because it 's meatloaf night . Come along , Lemon , before this whole dump blows up . Uh Commander , could you tell me when the bomb is exploding ? Of course , my significant soldier ! The bomb is voice-activated . It will detonate the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word . What 's the word ? Uh , Sir . It 's the one word the robot uses more than any other . We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently used words . Number 10 : " CHUMP " Number 9 : " CHUMPETTE " Number 8 : " YOURS " Number 7 : " UP " Number 6 : " PIMPMOBILE " Number 5 : " BITE " Number 4 : " MY " Number 3 : " SHINY " Number 2 : " DAFFODIL " And Bender 's number one most frequently uttered word ... The word which , if uttered , will blow up this entire planet . " ASS " . We don 't have long ! We demand bouncing , followed by rolling followed by rolling of the third type . Say what ? My chair 's too hard . It 's a real pain in the ... Uh what do you call it ? Lower back ! Yeah that whole region . Ok I got to break down that gate , beat up those three guards Steal that chopper and rescue Bender . Hey I did it ! Wait , that 's not me . Come on ! We got to save Bender ! You want to save him too Lemon ? You barely know him . Fry , don 't you recognize me ? Hermes ? Lee , when will I see you again ? The two of you are good friends ? But I thought we would be good friends . Well let 's see how friendly you get when you 're sharing a prison cell . Hey , Zapp ? Leela ! So it 's you I 've been attracted to ! Oh God , I 've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman . Let 's do it again sometime . The elders tell of a young ball much like you . He bounced 3 meters in the air . Then he bounced 1.8 meters in the air . Then he bounced 4 meters in the air . Do I make myself clear ? Mr. Ambassador , our people tell the same story . These balls are making me testy ! If they don 't stop bouncing and jiggling ' , I swear , I 'm gonna shove this treaty up their ... Wait a second . Where do you shove things up a ball ? This isn 't the productive area of discussion . We 're here . I followed the bouncing balls . I 'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down . Ok , my best friend 's life is at stake . I can finally prove that I 'm not a coward . Will you push me ? I already did ! Thank you ! At last , war has made me into a man . Please gentlemen , we must put an end to the bloodshed . We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks . We can not condone bouncing of the seventh variety . Enough of this crap ! I 'm catching the next pimpmobile out of here ! But before I go , I have one thing to say . Bite my shiny metal ... Stop ! You can 't say the next word ! Up yours , chump ! I said it 906 times before lunch . Bender , if you say the A-word , you 'll blow this whole planet straight to the H-Word . Young man , you have the bravery of a hero . And breath as fresh as a summer ham . What ? What is funny ? Bender 's got the upper hand now . The name of the game is : Make Bender Happy , or He Blows Up the Planet ! I 'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here , one more minute ... listening to these idiots talk about bouncing . Please ! Stay calm . There 's no need to bounce off the handle . That 's it , I 'm saying it ! A is for ... Wait ! Stop ! We give in to all of Earth 's demands . The war is over . Our home planet is yours . All right ! Hey wait a minute ! This is your home planet ? We 're the evil invading aliens ? Correct . Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson . Don 't mess with Earth ! May you bounce in peace . Get the hell off my planet ! Well , that 's it . Let 's reactivate him . Wake up ! Hey chumps and chumpettes ! Did you get the bomb out ? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say ? I 'm sorry , but we couldn 't remove it . It 's stuck in there with glue or something , I don 't know . Well this is just great . What 's the point of living if I can 't say " ass " ? Hey I didn 't blow up ! Ass , ass , ass , ass ! Alright ! I 'm back in the saddle ! We couldn 't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it . It 's from the list of words that you almost never say . That 's using your ass . So what 's the word ? We think it 's better if you don 't know . Aw come on , I 'm not going to say it . Please ? Oo is it " please " ? No . Words I never say . Oh I know , " thanks " ! Bender , stop trying to destroy the world . Wait , wait , wait . Is it " sorry " ? No . " Funderful " ? " Nonalcoholic " ? Quit it ! Enough already . " Compassion . " " Shrimp toast . " " Antiquing " ? I 'm alright .

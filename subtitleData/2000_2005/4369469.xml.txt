 I think you ruffled his feathers . Hmm very funny . Meanwhile our dinner 's disappearing . Summerlee can always roast more lizard . Not while I 've got a king size chicken in my sights . You were high left . Oh really and have you ever fired a gun ? Ned 's shown me once or twice . Once or twice that doesn 't really make you an expert in firearms now does it ? Doesn 't take an expert to know you missed . Everyone 's a critic . There ! I 'll circle around left try to cut off his retreat . I 'm not going to miss . Of course not . What the hell was that ? Oh no ! Roxton ! Sorry I was blinded by the light and he ran right by me . Roxton ? I didn 't miss . At the dawn of the century A band of adventurers set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations ... and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World You didn 't mean to shoot her ... it was an accident . Roxton ! It could have happened to anyone . But it didn 't , did it ? It happened to me , again . Get down . Thanks , Ned . Professor ! Back already ? You 'll be happy to know that I 've patched the leak in the balloon . It 's as right as rain again . Summerlee . Good Lord what happened ? I shot her . Why on earth did you do that ? Let 's get her inside . The bullet wound is superficial just a crease really . Thank God . Why is she still unconscious ? She must have hit her head when she fell . There 's rather a nasty bump . You 're not going to leave her ? There 's not much else I can do . No - not good enough . John she needs to rest and let her body heal itself . It 's not serious . I 'll stay with her . Call me if you need anything . And you call this a sport . Oh I think you 're about to see some action . This one 's a monster . Get the net . Well pull ! Ah got it ! Well pull ! I 'm trying ! Where am I ? You 're safe that 's all that matters . Oh no I 've got to . Try not to move . Summerlee ! Summerlee ? Whoa gently now , gently . You 're supposed to be resting . How are you feeling ? A little groggy . What happened ? I , ah I shot you ... sorry . John Roxton . You know me ? I 've been searching for you for all of you . No wonder he drowned his bag must weigh fifty pounds . That 's a good theory . There 's a better one . He hasn 't been in the water long . So whoever killed him can 't be too far away ? Let 's see what his life was worth . Whoa , well he certainly had a better day than we did ... except for being dead . Where did he get all this stuff ? Grave robber most likely . There are many cultures ... who bury their dead with plates , coins , jewelry ... things to ease their trip into the new world . This however ... No I 've never seen anything like this . What do these etchings mean ? I 've no idea ; not like any native language I 've ever seen . Can you read this ? Seems to be directions . For the dead ? Seek the world beyond ... through the window of souls . The world beyond ... does that mean heaven ? Or hell . What if it doesn 't ? What if it means our world , the world beyond the plateau ? A way off . There 's only one way to find out . What the hell are you doing ? I 'm going to find the world beyond . We don 't even know where this stuff came from . Sure we do , upriver . Upriver ? Where this guy got himself dead ? It 's a good place to start . My name 's Catherine Riley . I 'm part of expedition sent here to find you . An expedition to rescue us ? Well mainly to rescue you Professor Summerlee . The Zoological Society pushed you to go and after you disappeared . Really , that 's very decent of them . Where 's the rest of your party ? Ah they ... they didn 't make it . You 're saying they 're dead ... all of them ? What happened ? We were unprepared . Well it was a rescue mission for Pete sake . Wouldn 't you come armed to the teeth ? Well no one believed Challenger was right . We thought you 'd all been lost in the Amazon . The last thing we expected was to land in the middle of savages and Neanderthals . Ape-men . Those who survived the welcoming committee didn 't make it past the T-rex . But you survived somehow ? I was lucky ... relatively lucky . Yes well perhaps that 's enough for now . Miss Riley needs to rest . Lord Roxton ? Just Roxton will do Miss Riley . The others , Challenger Malone , Miss Krux ? Are they here ? Well actually they 've gone fishing but they should be back soon . Are you all right ? Yeah , yeah I 'm fine ... everything will be fine . Just get some rest . It looks like he went in the river here . Scuff marks . Yes definitely signs of a fight . Two maybe three attackers . Looks like an ambush . Three on one , knife in the back , tossed him in the river , problem solved . Gotta admit it 's efficient . Hell of a price to pay for a few trinkets . But not for this . Well come on then ; faint hearts never won fair maidens . Never got knifed in the back either . For a chance to get off this god forsaken plateau , I am willing to shed a little blood . Yes I just prefer if it weren 't my own . Get Down ! Thanks . Now we 're even . I guess that means that 's the right direction . Yeah that makes me feel a whole lot better . Where you going ? To find a way home ; all the way home . Coming ? Summerlee . My dear girl you shouldn 't be up and about already . I 'm sorry I wish there was some other way . You 're obviously disoriented from that bump on your head ... Hands up ! You don 't need to tell me Summerlee , I can smell it from here ... tastes like ... Hey , over there . Don 't ! On the table ! I knew it ... you 're not on any rescue mission . Yes I am ... it 's just not you I 'm trying to save . Tie them up , tight . Not a chance . Don 't make me shoot you . Look ... whatever trouble you 're in , we can help you . Stay back . Or else ? I don 't have time for this . You can 't shoot all of us . No ? But I can kill him or maybe the girl . Which life are you willing to sacrifice ? In the chair ! Now ! Sorry old boy . I need to know . How long was I unconscious ? How much time did I lose ? Two hours maybe three . Three hours ? They must have found the body . They must be half way up river by now . They ? They who ? I don 't have time to explain not that you 'd believe me . Tighter ! What the hell is this place ? It 's some sort of shrine . These characters look like the same ones that were on that tablet . They are . So the other world was Heaven . Not necessarily . Seek the world beyond through the window of souls . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? What 's the eye if not the window to the soul ? Marguerite . Just hold them off . We could use a hand ! Got it ! Malone ! Cover me ! Go ! Malone ! Hang on ! Watch out ! I can 't hold them off ! I can 't hold them off ! Please don 't let go of me . What the hell is going on up there ? It 's all right ; I 'm a friend . Malone anything bad I have ever said about you . Marguerite Krux fancy meeting you here . Who the hell are you ? An ambassador from your future . Do be careful Roxton . Oh not to worry Summerlee , I probably taste like chicken . Ah got it . I don 't understand why didn 't she kill us ? We weren 't the ones she was after . Do you think ... surely not the others ? They should have been back by now . You stay here Summerlee just in case . We 'll never catch her . She 's had too much of a head start . The balloon ! I had to fill it to check the patch it 's ready to fly . Then let 's go and the next time I shoot her it won 't be an accident . You can 't really expect us to believe you 're from the future ? A hundred years into the future to be exact . Right . Of course you 're the skeptic ; the newspaperman Ned Malone . And you sir , George Edward Challenger ... it 's a real honor to meet you . As well as this lady of course ... a true heroine . Marguerite ? Now I know you 've got a screw loose . Hey ! Well if you don 't believe me perhaps you 'll believe this ... Slowly does it . Where I come from you 're exploits are legendary the stuff myths are made of . I like the sound of that . But we haven 't returned . Not yet . Oh my God look at that date . April 16th 1920 . That 's four months from now . And so we left him there ... hoping scarcely daring to believe that this unfortunate man ... might lead us finally home . And then we found the shrine . It seems sir that you have the advantage over us . My name is James Kemper ... but more importantly today is the day Marguerite finds the key of souls ... and uses it to uncover a passage off the plateau . So this is our ticket out of here . Well I take it back you are a hero . Time travel it 's absurd pure fantasy . As were your theories regarding dinosaurs . And like you - few people believed I 'd survive this trip , much less succeed . Even if we were to believe this incredible story ... it still doesn 't explain ... What the hell you 're doing here ? I 'm not the only one who 's traveled back in time . Of course not , damn tourists . This isn 't a joke Marguerite . Someone doesn 't want you to make it home . We should have spotted her by now . And more than that we should have seen Challenger and the others by the river . Where the hell are they ? There ! Take us down . Catherine ! Hang on ! Take us up ! Take us up ! I am ! Come on ! I 've got you . You wouldn 't drop me ? You wouldn 't lie to me ? No I swear . Now what the hell are you up to ? I 'm here to kill Marguerite . The future ? Right . Sounds like something out of H.G. Wells . I know everything about you , everyone does . Lord John Roxton born Jan 12th 1882 ... never married inherited the title after his brother was killed in a hunting accident . - Dies June 23192 ... - No I don 't want to know . That 's six months from now . She doesn 't have very much faith in you does she ? June 23rd , go ahead and read it , it was Marguerite 's . Lord John Richard Roxton died this morning ... the latest victim of this horrible disease ravaging London . Raptors and ape-men couldn 't kill him ... how strange he should be taken by something so small . I thought he would live forever . Enough games ... I want the truth . That is the truth or it will be . The plague that kills you , Marguerite is a carrier . And it isn 't just London that is ravaged by it , it 's the world . Marguerite destroys half the world . And you say that man has been to the moon ? Sure , and beyond . So Jules Verne was right . And the atom what about the atom ? Man it 's what fueled my journey here . Incredible . How did you get on , did you find anything ? Destiny shouldn 't be this hard . These ruins go on forever . Marguerite 's already found the key . Why don 't you just tell us where the door is and we 'll move on out of here . I wish I could . The exact location wasn 't mentioned in the histories . Apparently it was a secret you kept to your grave . Remind me to be more chatty next time . What I don 't understand is why anybody would want to kill Marguerite . The door of souls leads to a network of passages it takes you weeks to get out . You nearly starve . Suddenly this doesn 't sound quite so appealing . But on the way you discover the mother lode of an unknown crystal , concentrates sunlight , transforms it into pure energy . A cheap inexhaustible source of energy ... now that would change the world . And does . To some it 's worth a fortune to others cost them their fortune . And you become a very , very rich woman . Someone has to . But why kill her ? If Marguerite isn 't alive to discover the crystal the world becomes a different game . New winners and losers ... and so an assassin is hired ... fanatic , she 'll stop at nothing to destroy you . Then let 's keep moving , Challenger . I 'll check up ahead . Catherine , what happened to my parents ? I thought you didn 't believe me ? Do I find them ? You stop looking . No I would never stop looking . When the others leave you stay behind to keep searching . Malone promises he 'll return for you ... he never does . Ned ? After a while you leave the plateau to come after him ... you couldn 't have known . He was already dead , the plague . It looks like it 's all clear . Look out ! Well there 's a trick right out of Marguerite 's bag if ever I 've seen one . These men are guardians of an ancient temple sworn to keep the gateway between our two worlds closed . The gateway Marguerite 's about to open . Yes . So what are they going to do about us ? They 're going to help us . So hasn 't you telling us about the door already changed history ? It seemed a risk worth taking . What happens to me ? I was wondering when you would get around to asking . Sure you want to know ? No but tell me anyway . Nothing to worry about . You come home a hero . How could Gladys refuse you after that ? Gladys , I marry Gladys ? Your book about your adventures becomes a best seller . You and Gladys travel the world . When her father retires you even take over the family business you know the newspaper . Really ? I 've never thought of myself as much of a publisher . Well you do okay but it 's your son who really shines . He turns it into an empire . My son ? Two daughters and a son you 're a lucky man . Unbelievably lucky I 'd say . Especially since Gladys can 't have children ... ever . Really ? It 's her biggest regret . So , tell me again how I have a son . It 's a modern miracle . My God I 'm really here . Marguerite ? Oh my God ! What is it ? What 's wrong ? We 're too late Marguerite 's already found the key of souls . The key , but not the door right ? They should be close by now ... too close . But as long as she doesn 't go home ? You don 't understand . As soon as she goes through the gateway ... she 'll breathe in spores that have been dormant for thousands of years . What do you mean spores ? They mutate becomes a deadly virus . But Marguerite lives ? She has a natural immunity ... so she 'll carry it with her and infect everyone she meets . There 's still a chance that ... No , I 'm sorry . What the hell are you doing ? Millions of lives are at stake . I can 't let you stop me . Catherine ! Catherine ! Malone ! Thank God you 're here . What happened ? We were attacked . How many ? I don 't know five maybe six . I didn 't hear any shots . That 's how it works . This is it , this has got to be it . I did it . I found the way home . Don 't move . Marguerite I 've found you at last . I wish I didn 't have to do this . That makes two of us . No one knows better than me how ugly destiny can turn ... Except you . Wait ! Please don 't shoot me in the back ... at least let me see your face . All right . Don 't go through that door . Who are you ? I 'm Catherine , I 'm your great granddaughter . Don 't be ridiculous . How else would I have this ? It 's yours , the legacy you left me ... along with your genetic immunity . Toss it over here , easy . Handwriting could be mine . Do you have any idea what it 's like to live while everyone around you , everyone you care about dies . You will , October 15th 1922 ... a month after my grandmother was born . They have finally traced the genesis of this horrible disease to me . I have caused thousands already to die ... and who knows how many more as this contagion spreads . No ! Keep reading . And one other , one death more ... of the man I loved . I thought I was a hero . I didn 't know I was bringing him home to die . Home is waiting for you through that door ... and so is the plague that will murder millions . I did this ? It wasn 't your fault . You didn 't know until it was too late . Marguerite . Put it down now ! Roxton , look ! They 're alive . Hey Malone wakey wakey hey ! Kemper the way home . Where 's Marguerite ? That way . Stay with them . Be careful . Watch out for Kemper . Family reunions , they 're so depressing . What have you done ? She was going to kill you . She wanted to stop me from spreading a plague . But my dear Marguerite ... if you don 't destroy the world how can I save it . There never was any crystal was there ? Sorry but by the time you discovered my little fib ... you would have already been infected with the virus . Why ? Money of course , and power . You see I 'm the one who finally finds a cure for Krux 's syndrome . You would condemn the world for money ? Don 't look so shocked Marguerite you 're about to do the same . Go ahead greet your destiny . Don 't . No . Don 't be a fool ... you 'll be rich , famous . You 'll have everything you ever wanted . You 'll be a little isolated in your later years but that 's the price you pay for celebrity . For God sake by all accounts you 're nothing but a cold hearted . Don 't grow a conscious on me now . What can I say ... you shouldn 't believe everything you read . I could just force you through ... lock the door behind you . You 'd have to keep going or starve to death in the tunnels . We all have to go sometime . Have it your way . She inherited your genetic immunity . If I have to I 'll drag her through the tunnels myself . Either way I will have my plague . Drop the gun . Lord John Roxton I presume . Oh no . I 've got you . I 've got you . What are you doing ? Cheating fate . The doorway ? Closed , forever . Thank you . What are you thanking me for ... for getting you killed ? No , thanks to you I will never have lived . Get back Marguerite .

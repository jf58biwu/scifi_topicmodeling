 Nice job . Right off the plane and we have a fresh homicide for you . - How do we know this is our guy ? - We don ´ t . The neighborhood ´ s about right , though . Her age is consistent with the other victims . Shouldn ´ t the police notify you if it matches the M.O. ? They should . They never do . What the hell are you doing here , Novack ? Looking around . Special Agent Bowman , Detective McElroy . Detective . She ´ s with the Behavior Profile Unit ... just in from Quantico . The Bureau has jurisdiction over serial murders . Only nobody said this is a serial killer . That ´ s what I came to find out . Where ´ s the body ? No sign of a struggle . None . There was one , He straightens up . What have you got on her ? Her name ´ s Jessica Larsen . She owned a restaurant in the Marina : " Larsen Station . " I know it . Eight bucks for a glass of wine . McElroy , let ´ s not play dumb Where ´ s the photo ? Her earrings are missing . Another edition to his collection . This is the seventh homicide with the same M.O. Upscale young women , murdered in their beds . No sign of a struggle . There ´ s always jewelry missing and there ´ s always two photos . Two ? One in the victim ´ s hands . Another hidden someplace without a piece . This is a serial murder . The Bureau has jurisdiction . Okay , we ´ re outta here . Dust for prints . You ´ re not going to find any . He never leaves prints . She was still alive when he took this picture . Novack . This guy ´ s one cruel sick son of a bitch . You gotta have some leads . Give us something . Kurt , you can ´ t keep stonewalling us on this . If there was anything I could tell you , I would . Another dead body ... another no comment from F.B.I. Agent Kurt Novack . No wonder they think we ´ re stonewalling them . This many homicides and we still have nothing . I ´ m working up a profile . We ´ ve got enough to get started . We ´ re getting started . He ´ s way ahead of us . Novack , I gotta a call for you , seriously . Keep it short , please . Novak here . Novack , you never say anything to those nice people . Don ´ t you think you ought to release the pictures ? It ´ s him . Maybe he ´ s around here somewhere . I ´ m considering it . There are pros and cons though . It ´ s evidence , Novack . Don ´ t you think the public should see it ? Five-five-five zero-one-four-four . Get me a trace on five-five-five zero-one-four-four . Don ´ t you believe in sharing ? That ´ s not very nice , Novack . Well , I like to keep some things to myself . You ´ re a smart guy . I ´ m sure you understand that . Just release the damn pictures Novack ! I ´ m not kidding ! Look , it ... He ´ s gone . Did you get it ? Nothing . He surprised us this time . Let ´ s be ready for the next time . Let ´ s go over the details one more time . He leaves two snapshots of each victim . He cuts one of them up . - But he doesn ´ t dismember them . - Exactly . In fact , he lays them out very neatly . - He wants it to look perfect . What does that tell us ? I think he ´ s collecting the pieces . A leg missing here , an arm there , part of a face , hip . We ´ ve got the body . We don ´ t need the pictures . Why does he leave them ? He wants us to know he ´ s taking pictures . Why ? It ´ s a family album . He ´ s leaving them for us because we ´ re apart of the family ? Well , actually that ´ s very possible . Let ´ s consider something else . Look at the way he acts . Look at the way he takes care of the body . Brushes the hair , makes everything neat . I ´ d say that makes him a caregiver . Probably from a small family , possible an only child . So we get a neat tidy guy , who may be an only child . How does that help us ? Let ´ s talk about evidence . What have we got ? He cuts the ends off the pictures . No serial numbers what ´ s no good . He meets the victims on the street so no one see them together . No one can l.D. him . You ´ re telling me what we don ´ t have . What do we have ? The fact that he picks up successful career-orientated women . I assume presentable , well-spoken , educated . Very good . Alright . So what else ? Come on , people , we ´ ve got five homicides in the L.A area ... one in Denver one in San Francisco . He travels . Maybe a salesman . We know he lives around here ´ cause there ´ s multiple killings here . Keep working on that profile . Maybe you get something more concrete . In the meantime , let ´ s run Denver and San Francisco dates . Maybe they have something in common A trade show , a tennis tournament . I don ´ t know , anything . The first murders were months apart , then weeks . The one before this one , just ten days . And raise the stakes . He ´ s gaining on us . Let ´ s get a move on , eh ? Alright . - ls he sleeping ? - Oh , yeah . Total log . They said on the news tonight that there was another murder . You know , when he ´ s asleep , he looks just like you . He has your mouth . He does not . He ´ s an image of your father . Is it the same killer ? Turn around . I want to check out your mouth . - Why won ´ t you answer my question ? What ´ s the question ? Is the killer the same guy ? We ´ re in bed and you want to talk about killings ? - What do you want to talk about ? - I don ´ t want to talk about it . Then it ´ s a good thing I saw you on the news . Otherwise I wouldn ´ t know what my husband is doing , now would I ? Come on , Michelle . I ´ m not asking for deep dark F.B.I. secrets . I just feel so out of the loop . It ´ s not a loop you want to be in , trust me . Kurt , you are distracted all the time . Distant . You used to talk to me . I never worked with serial killings , Michelle . You know ? I never had a son then . What does Johnny have to do with this ? I didn ´ t say I wanted to talk about this in front of him . We ´ re not two kids living in an apartment anymore . This is ugly stuff . This is not the kind of thing you bring into your house . - Another bad dream . - You want me to go ? No . This is exactly why I try to keep this out of the house . It ´ s okay , partner . - Hi Daddy . - Hi . - There wasn ´ t anyone here , right ? - No . Are you sure ? Am I sure ? Your Dad ´ s an F.B.I. Agent . I ´ m sorry . Nothing to be sorry about . If I didn ´ t get scared , you wouldn ´ t have to wake up . I wasn ´ t asleep and I was going to come in here anyway ... because I want to see my best buddy . So move over , let me lie down with you . You got to get some sleep , man . You got school in the morning . Ugh . Yeah , well , everybody ´ s gotta go to school . So close your eyes , all right ? Dad ´ s right here . Come on , get some sleep . Honey . Oh . Sorry . I didn ´ t mean to sleep in here . Dad . Why do I have all these nightmares ? Well , buddy , everybody has nightmares . You worry about stuff during the day ... it pop up in your head at night when you ´ re sleeping . You ´ re worried about your Dad ´ s job , aren ´ t you ? Yeah . Johnny , your Dad ´ s a part of a team . We go after the criminals . And put them in jail . It ´ s nothing for you to be scared . I ´ m always going to be there to protect you and your Mom . - Okay ? - Okay . I ´ ll tell you , if you want to be scared of something ... I ´ d worrie about how I ´ ll handle this hotrod once I get it on . - So let ´ s take it for a spin ? - Cool ! - Calm , Calm , calm . That was so fun ! Maybe I should build one in my size . - Dad ! Come on , let ´ s do it again . - We should go home , buddy . No , one more time . Alright , one more time . I ´ m going uphill . No hands ! Mom ! I came down the hill . It was so cool . I knew it would be . Now go get yourself washed up . Something came up . While you ´ re at it , take a bath . - Another homicide . - Bath ! Now ! Come on , I ´ ll help you get started . Go on ... - Where ? - Sydney , Australia . - Sydney , Australia ? - Same M.O. The victim ran a small theater . He left two snapshots , everything . It ´ s our guy . Stay in touch . Get all their reports . You ´ re going . Look , I ´ ve got too much on my plate here as it is . And besides , they ´ re not going to let me investigate their case . They have a suspect in custody . I am not going into details . You don ´ t need a family history . That ´ s the only way I ´ m going to do this , so decide . Not that sweater . It makes me look fat . So , what do you say ? I owe you one . Thank you . I wish you didn ´ t have to go . You ´ ll miss Johnny ´ s spring break . He ´ s really enjoying his time with you . I wish I could spend more time with you , too . What do you say , we all go on the Bureau . - Are you serious ? - Yes ! I don ´ t want to hear that , Roger . You ´ re insulting my intelligence . This was found in the dresser of your hotel . I ´ ve never seen that in my life . Well maybe this picture will help you remember . The name is Leslie Blaine . I don ´ t even know her . You ´ re not doing very well in explaining things today , Roger . Maybe you can explain this . I don ´ t know , I don ´ t smoke . " Larsen Station " . That ´ s a restaurant in Los Angeles , isn ´ t that right , Mr. Novack ? - ln the Venice area . - l ´ ve never been there . We had seven homicides back in the U.S. A lot of similarities to this one here , Mr. Fortson . I don ´ t know anything about that . Nothing . Put yourself in my place , Roger . We get a phone call that says ... you were seen picking up Leslie Blaine at her work . Who would say that ? I ´ ve never been there . I have a wife and a child . I only go out with my family . You might be making a good point there , Roger . We don ´ t usually put much stock in anonymous phone calls . But , how does that explain the dead girl ... being found in your hotel room ? How does it explain the necklace ? And the matches ? I never saw that in my room . I don ´ t know how they got there . I could do you a favor , mate . Make it a lot easier . We do not have capital punishment here in Australia ... so wouldn ´ t it be a good idea if you to talk to me ? Alright , this is a man who does not want to help himself . I think we should just leave him alone ... let him work it out . Interview terminate , twelve-fifteen . The show ´ s over . I ´ m not so sure this is our man . Of course it is . He ´ s petrified cause he knows we ´ re onto him . Novack . Congratulations . Yeah , I know . it looks good . - I don ´ t know , he ´ s falling apart . - Of course , the game is over . We ´ re dealing with a deeply divided personality , Kurt . I don ´ t care , he wouldn ´ t whimper like that . - There ´ s a ton of evidence . - This is not the guy who called me . You said he disguised his voice . Alright , look , we ´ ll play it out . Okay ? We ´ ve got seven homicides , they ´ ve got one . If Roger Fortson is alibied for any one of them ... - We ´ re already on it . - Alright . You sound like you want to be this guy ´ s lawyer . As far as I ´ m concerned , we ´ ve made our case . There they are ! - Have you made an arrest ? - You ´ ve got a suspect , right ? - ls he an American ? - We have a suspect . We ´ re proceeding with prosecution . And yes , he ´ s an American . Even the birds are weird . How come everything ´ s so strange ? Australia is separated from the rest . It ´ s evolved differently . Looks like Daddy had a good day . He told you they ´ d look him up ? Come on , sweetie . Let me have the key . - lt beeped three times . - Did it ? I recommend a nap before dinner . Your father should be home by then . - l ´ m not tired . - Then humor me . - Can I watch TV ? - No . Please ? Oh , all right . - Can we get a pizza ? - We ´ ll see when Dad gets back . Rikko goes down the left side ! He ´ s running for another drive ! This is beautiful ! This is lovely ! That was a lovely shot ! Johnny , it ´ s okay . It ´ s all right . I ´ m here . I ´ m right here . It ´ s all right . Okay ? It ´ s okay . Hey . What ´ s up ? Another bad dream ? It wasn ´ t a dream . I saw him . - I saw somebody in the room . - Who did you see ? How he look like ? I don ´ t know . That ´ s because there was nobody here , partner . It ´ s just another bad dream . I got something that might cheer you up . So ? Wait till all the kids at school see this . - Use with caution . - Please , do that . Especially in here . This is for you . Oh , Kurt . It ´ s beautiful . Thank you . - Thanks , Dad . - You got it , buddy . What do you mean you can ´ t find the tickets , they ´ re right here . In the computer , sir . You ´ re not going to find them in there ´ cause they ´ re in my hand ! Someone seem to have canceled your reservation . They can ´ t be canceled . I have them right here ! I ´ m doing the best I can , sir . Your flight is booked out . Yes . My wife and son and I are part of who is booked out to . Here it is . You were reticketed on Oceanic . Flight eight-one-six . Look I haven ´ t been reticketed . I have three tickets in my hand . This is ridiculous . You were reticketed and upgraded to first class . I ´ m an Agent wit the U.S ... . First class ? That ´ s not going to cost extra , is it ? - No , sir . - Thank you . Welcome , sir , May I help you , there ? This aisle , second row on the left . Maybe they upgraded you because you caught the guy . Maybe . Welcome , sir . First class . This way , sir . Enjoy your flight . Okay , that ´ s the second row , the window seat ... the aisle and the one opposite . May I take your coat and your scarf ? Your jacket , sir ? No . Thanks . Look at this . Are you sure we ´ re not paying extra for this ? Hi . I ´ m Justin . - You must be Johnny . - How do you know his name ? It ´ s right here on the manifest Mr. and Mrs. Novack and son John . - That ´ s cool . - Can I get you folks a drink ? Soda , Anything without caffeine . Long flight . Wise choice . You ? - White wine , please . - Sir ? - Scotch and soda . - Be right back with the drinks . And I ´ m supposed to be the suspicious one . Oh , yeah , right . Case close . Now we can all relax . - Here , let me get that . - That ´ s all right . - No , really . - l ´ ve got it ! - I was just trying to be helpful . - Excuse me . Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . Captain Bruce Copeland . I ´ d like to welcome you to Oceanic flight eight-one-six ... from Sydney to Los Angels lnternational Airport . Now sit back , get comfortable . We ´ re waiting for one more passenger . As soon as everyone is on board , we ´ ll push back from the gate . Shouldn ´ t take long . In the meantime ... our flight attendants are standing by to help you . - Did they page the terminal ? - Several times . Nothing so far . And this is someone who was on the flight from Melbourne ? - Yes , sir . - Alright . We ´ ll give him two more minutes and we ´ ll yank his baggage . I ´ m not costing us on-time departure over some clown ... - who ´ s passed out in the lounge . - Way to go , Bruce . They put a little scotch in the scotch and soda in first class . Flight attendants prepare for departure . - I wonder if he made it . - Who ? The guy we were waiting for . We assume it ´ s a guy ? Just because someone is late , doesn ´ t mean it ´ s a woman , Kurt . I bet it ´ s a guy , Daddy . You ´ re always late for everything . - When was the last time ... - Everyone of my soccer games . When was the last time we ever saw the beginning of a movie ? Wow . You two really know how to hurt a guy . I ´ m going to have to take the glasses away for take off ... but I promise a refill as soon as we leave . Thank you . Seat belt . Good man . I ´ ll freshen that as soon as we ´ re up . Okay , sir . Thank you . Seat back up . I better get back . Well , if there ´ s anything else , just press your call button . Thanks . But the walk will do me good . It ´ s nice to stretch the legs . It ´ s a long flight . Thank you . Okay . Wow . He ´ s passed out , huh ? You are so sweet . I love them . The scarf and this . - You ´ re spoiling me . - What are you talking about ? Where did you get those ? - What do you mean ? - Where did you get them ? - Where you put them . - ln the seat pocket . Kurt , what ´ s wrong ? Michelle , they came off the last victim in Los Angeles . Oh , my God . Hello ? Hey . I hope your wife likes the earrings . I went to a lot of trouble to get them for her . Why don ´ t you send me your address ... and I ´ ll have her drop you a thank you note . That ´ s very cute , Novack . You should have released the photos like I asked you to . Get the public involved . Maybe someone saw me leave one of the apartments . Maybe some concerned citizen would have turned me in . Maybe you could have saved some lives . Michelle you got to get a hold of yourself . Let ´ s not jump to conclusions , okay ? I want you to come with me . Now . Now we got to think this through . We don ´ t know if he ´ s on the plane . He could have put the earrings there while we ´ re on the ground . - How would he know where we are ? - The seating plan , remember ? I guess . Look , Michelle , if he was on the same plane as me ... - he ´ s not going to let me know . - I don ´ t understand , he ´ s arrested . The Sydney police were gung-ho to close the case . And you weren ´ t ? I had my doubts . That ´ s not like you , Kurt . How could you just let them ... I don ´ t have jurisdiction in Australia . I told them to keep investigating . It ´ s the only thing I could do . I wish you would have told me that . I didn ´ t know it would involve us . The truth is , Michelle , the guy has called me before this . What ? ! I didn ´ t tell you . I didn ´ t want you to be alarmed . When did this happen ? He ´ s zeroing in on me because i ´ m leading the investigation . Johnny said he saw someone in the room . You don ´ t think that ... No , no , no . I don ´ t think . He ´ s up . You better go ... - Did you have a nice nap ? - Yeah . - Can I get a soda ? - Sure . Sure , honey . Excuse me . I ´ m sorry , Mr. Novack . No one is allowed to go into the cabin . I ´ m with the F.B.I .. I need to speak with the Captain . Captain , this gentleman needs to talk with you . Yes ? Special Agent Kurt Novack , Federal Bureau of lnvestigation . And ... ? Captain , the passenger we were waiting for before take-off ... - did he get in the aircraft ? - No . Why ? Was he ticketed form Melbourne or was he a new arrival ? I ´ m answering your questions , you ´ re not answering mine . On this aircraft , I ´ m the Captain . So I suggest you put your cards on the table . What do you think is the matter ? Why does anything have to be the matter ? He ´ s with the F.B.I .. I ´ ll bet he ´ s who came over ´ cause of the serial killer they caught . - You ´ re kidding . - No , it said in the paper . - Some F.B.I. Agent came over . - Really . There were only two possibilities Captain . The earrings were put there by somebody who is still here ... or by somebody who got off before we departed . You ´ re assuming it ´ s somebody who got off ? I ´ m not assuming anything , but I have to consider every angle . If it ´ s someone who is still on the aircraft ... he ´ s going to be with us for the next 14 hours , But if he got off ... Right . He could be anywhere . Which is why I need you to tell me ... if a passenger who buys a ticket for L.A ... and gets off twelve thousand miles short . Isn ´ t this unbearable ? - What ? - Economy . My manager made the reservation . I don ´ t know what happened . Must be awful . Right . This is what we got . Passenger is Mr. Terri Williamson . American . Board at Melbourne ... booked to L.A. But he ´ s not on board ? Well , we had a 125passengers from Melbourne . About half of them are booked through ... but the layover in Sydney is usually around two hours . Most of them get off , get back on . This guy didn ´ t get back on . Now do you mind telling me what you want this guy for ? Murder . - He killed someone ? - Eight people , actually . Glad he missed the flight . I ´ m going to need to speak to some of your flight attendants . If they remember this Williamson , maybe I can get a description . No problem . But if your following this guy , How you don ´ t know what he looks like ? Actually , I think he ´ s following me . - Hey , where did Daddy go ? - He ´ ll be back in a minute . - He went to go talk to the Captain . - What are they talking about ? I think Daddy wants to learn how to fly the airplane . Yeah ! Right ... No , they ´ re the same earrings No question about it . - He just called me . - He called you on the plane ? Then he ´ s got to be on board . Cap . , would he have made that call from the ground ? If he new the number , which he could have got when he was aboard . Did you get that ? Affirmative . What do you need me to do ? There was a passenger from Melbourne ... who got off the plane during a layover in Sydney . He never got back on . Name ´ s Williamson , Terri . We ´ re transmitting the manifest to you right now . Check him out . - l ´ ll get right on it . - Tell me if you know anything . - Kurt , wait a minute . - What ? You were right about that guy they had locked up in Australia . He had a surgery.He was in the hospital for the first 2 homicides . How is it that I knew that ? Over and out . Excuse me . Johnny , Mommy and Daddy need to speak alone for a minute . - How come no one tells me anything ? - You and I have secrets , right ? - Right . - Mommy and Daddy too . Keep your seat belt on and we ´ ll be back in a minute . Apparently , it was a Melbourne passenger who didn ´ t get back on . Come here . He didn ´ t get back on . He could have put the earrings there ... and got the phone number . Andrea ´ s checking it out . I hope you ´ re right . Justin . We need a doctor . - We ´ re not just fooling ourselves . - There ´ s a woman in the back ... I ´ m not sure what ´ s wrong with her . I ´ ll check the manifest . I ´ m sure there ´ s a doctor on board . I ´ m going to tell the Captain . Go back and stay with her . Can you do that ? Just slow down . I don ´ t want to create any panic . All right ? Okay , let ´ s go . Miss , I ´ m with the F.B.I. What ´ s the matter ? It ´ s nothing , it ´ s just ... You better come with me . Okay , just hang on . Sweetheart , go sit with Johnny . I ´ ll be right back . Okay ? - What ´ s the problem ? - There ´ s a woman ... I need you to stand guard . Don ´ t let anybody back here . - Sir ? - What ´ s going on ? Everything ´ s fine , sir . Please , take your seat . Sit tight , honey , I ´ ll be right back . Mrs. Novack ? Everything okay ? Can I bring you something ? How about Johnny ? No , no . We ´ re fine . That ´ s alright . If you need anything , please just press the call button . I found her like that . I didn ´ t touch her . - ls she traveling alone ? - I believe she is . I ´ m a doctor Let me have a look . That answers your question , Captain . There ´ s a serial killer on board ... and he wants me to know he ´ s here . I don ´ t want anyone to know there ´ s been a homicide . Let ´ s keep it need-to-know as far as the crew is concerned . - You don ´ t think it could be ... - One of them ? Why not ? I ´ m not ruling anything out . We have to figure out where we ´ re going to put her body . Luggage hold . We ´ ll have to take her through the cabin . Alright , but let ´ s get a stretch and an oxygen mask . We ´ ll tell everyone she ´ s ill . No one needs to know she ´ s dead . Monique . Captain , I ´ ve got to talk to you . Someone ´ s going to have to carry her through the cabin , and I can ´ t . I can ´ t . Dean ... Oh . Her . This is your Captain speaking . May I have your attention , please . One of our passengers are ill . There ´ s no reason to be alarmed . We ´ re fortunate to have a physician on board . At this time , I ´ d like to ask you to keep the isles clear till the crew finish transporting her through the cabin . Thank you . What happened to her ? Seizure . She hit her head party hard when she fell . - Got it ? - Got it . Does anyone else have access to this area ? Not without the elevator key . Good . Make sure no one else comes down here . - ls this the Williamson residence ? - Yes . fbi . We ´ d like to talk to you , please . That passenger isn ´ t sick , is she ? I ´ m going to tell you as much as I know , Michelle . It ´ s no mistake that this maniac and I are on the same plane . He switched the tickets to put us on this flight . He killed this woman to let me know that he ´ s here . It has clearly become personal . Why would he do that , Kurt ? He ´ s trapped here with you . There ´ s nowhere to go . Unless he doesn ´ t care what happens . Kurt , why wouldn ´ t he care ? Michelle , this is not a rational man . We don ´ t know what he ´ s thinking . Okay ? - l ´ ve got talk to you , Mr. Novack . - Alright , go ahead . Just wait with Johnny . I ´ ll be right there , okay . - Yes ? - I keep going over all of this ... well , there ´ s this passenger . He was watching the lady who got killed . - What do you , mean , watching ? - He kept staring at her . It was kinda weird . Really weird , in fact . Alright , show me where he is . The guy on the aisle . Six rows back . Okay . Thanks . Wait minute , aren ´ t you going to question him ? Let ´ s find out who he is first . This is Oceanic 816 confirming . We have a code 1 1-14 ... dead body on board . A passenger , female . I ´ ll transmit the details . Make sure you have the appropriate equipment on landing . No . It wasn ´ t illness . It was a homicide apparently . We have a F.B.I. Agent on board . I ´ ll keep you posted . Your call to the states . It ´ s ringing . - Hello ? - Andrea , Novack . - He ´ s on the plane . How do you know ? Are you sure ? - He ´ s killed a passenger . - Oh , my God . Okay , listen . I just found out your missing passenger is a woman . The killer somehow altered the manifest . Maybe he killed her too . Look , let ´ s hope that ´ s not the case here . I want you to use the manifest I sent you ... and run every male passenger from the ages of 20 to 50 . There ´ s got to be a hundred a hundred and twenty of them . But I want you to start with a passenger named ... - do you have a seating chart ? - Yeah . passenger Reese . Carl Reese . Okay ? And then check all male flight personnel , in particular , Dean ... Franklin . Dean Franklin . I don ´ t need to say how urgent this is , right ? - Get back to me . - I will . Okay . One moment . Mr. Novack , you got another call . I ´ ll put you through . Novack . Making any progress , Novack ? - l ´ m holding my own . - Really ? Can you patch this through on to something I can walk around with ? You ´ re losing passengers . I think I ´ m gaining on you . That ´ s because you ´ re sick . I know . It ´ s unbearable . We got to talk about this . Yeah ? You name the place . I don ´ t think we ´ re ready for a face-to-face just yet . I ´ m ready , buddy . I ´ ve been ready a long time . We ´ re going to meet . I promise you , Kurt . But it ´ s going to be my call , not yours . Don ´ t count on it . I don ´ t count on anything . Or anyone . I ´ m still upset with you Kurt about those pictures . You mean your family album ? You make it sound so quaint . - Like your little family . - Let ´ s leave my family out of this ! Sorry . Like using my wife ´ s scarf to kill that passenger . Didn ´ t you like that ? I thought it was a nice touch . Kurt , why are you upset ? I respect you . Why do you think that I put you in first class ? What did you use to kill the other women ? - There ´ s another one ? - Terri Williamson . You ´ re guessing . Don ´ t do that . Let ´ s stick to the facts . - Like why you cut up the photos ? - Why do you think ? We ´ re thinking it ´ s some symbolic form of mutilation . I don ´ t mutilate anybody . Haven ´ t you even looked ? They all look so ... nice . So neat . Perfect . Is important to be perfect , right ? To be in control . To take care of people . Don ´ t you worry about who I ´ m taking care of . What about you ? What about me ? What is it about me anyway ? Miss , Do you have a key for this door ? You ´ re so busy trying to protect all these women ... you can ´ t even protect your own pretty little wife . I ´ m taking good care of her . Don ´ t worry about that . Really ? Then tell me what you ´ re doing way back ... when she ´ s up front with me ? You ´ re bluffing . You know what will happen to you if you ... " Oh , Kurt , it ´ s so beautiful . " That ´ s what she said when you gave her that cheap scarf . Now those earrings I gave her were beautiful . And , Kurt l ´ ve got a lot more presents in mind for her . Cute . Very cute . Talk to you later . No ! Johnny , go back . I ´ ll be right back . Kurt . Johnny did see him . He was in the room . Johnny and I was were alone and he was in the room . Oh , honey . I want you to pull his schedule for the past year . Immediately . Hey , I think we got something . What ? The passenger at the top of Novack ´ s list . Carl Reese . Currently unemployed but worked on Southeast Air . Canned him for sexual harassment . Transmit that to Kurt . Captain . Can you have one of yours bring Mr. Reese up here ? Justin ... - You can ´ t tell me what ´ s about ? - l ´ m sorry , sir .. I really have no idea . Hello . Right this way , sir . Thank you . What do you want ? - Have a seat , Mr. Reese . - And who might you be ? Special Agent Novack , F.B.I. Nice photo . I walked through the cabin , you weren ´ t in your seat . What do we have , bed checks now ? Just answer the question . Where you were ? I don ´ t know . The guy next to me was snoring . I saw an empty seat , and figured I could sit there . I see you were a flight attendant . Fired for sexual harassment . This isn ´ t about that lady who got sick , is it ? - Why would it be about her ? - Lying bitch . What did she tell you ? She ´ s dead , Carl . She was murdered . had nothing to do with her . That ´ s the truth . I tried to talk to her . She told me to get lost . I did . Okay . Let ´ s talk about something else . Where were you last Wednesday ? Why ? A woman was murdered in her apartment in Sydney . Where were you ? I wasn ´ t even in Australia last Wednesday . You don ´ t believe me ? My ticket . Take a look . I ´ ll be back with your entrées in a few minutes . Mrs. Novack , can I get you something to eat ? I ´ m not very hungry . Maybe later . Hey , Johnny , how about you ? You hungry ? - Yeah . - Good man . You want to clear a space for me ? Thank you . Let me see . You look to me like you are a lasagna guy , right ? - Yeah ! - Thought so . How about a glass of chardonnay , Mrs. Novack ? Maybe relax you , ease your apprehension a little . Why do you say I ´ m apprehensive ? I know there ´ s something going on and your husband is involved . Hey , it must be cool to have your Dad as an fbi agent . Now you have to eat all the salad or there ´ s no dessert . That ´ s an FAA regulation . You got a good kid there . Most kids drive us crazy on these long flights . - l ´ ll be back with your wine , okay ? - Thank you . Did you get your man ? - Let me see a crew list . - Now wait a minute . Captain , the killer knows this aircraft . He knew where to strangle her without being interrupted . How to get her out of the restroom through the overhead . He had access to passenger lists . How to get into airline computers to put me on the flight . He knew how to use the airline records ... to find someone he could frame in Australia . I ´ m betting that Terri Williamson never got off the plane in Sydney . So you tell me , who the hell could have pulled this off ? Now if Terri Williamson didn ´ t get of the plane , where could she be ? If she ´ s not below in any cabin , she has to be below decks . We took her down there before we landed in Sydney . Someone would notice she was missing when they seat check . What about when you were on the ground ? There ´ s always confusion when people are deplaning . Yeah , but that ´ s when catering uses the elevators . - They restock the kitchens . - No , wait a minute . He could have taken her down the hell hole . We store our computers down there . Excuse me . Flight management system , electronic controls , everything we need to run the aircraft . - Who else has a key for this ? - No one . I ´ m not incriminating myself ´ cause l ´ m the only who ´ s got a key ? I ´ m not ruling you out as a suspect if it ´ s what you ´ re asking . Stay right here , I meant it . I ´ ll be back in a minute . Excuse me , could you watch my son just for a second ? - I don ´ t want to leave him alone . - l ´ d be happy to . No problem . Thank you . I ´ m breaking the rules tonight . Ice cream before lasagna ... - but don ´ t tell the Captain . - Thanks . No problem . Your mom asked me to keep an eye on you . They ´ re really keeping your dad busy tonight , aren ´ t they ? Yeah . I think my mom went to look for him . You got a long way to go ... so I think you should finish your ice cream and try to sleep . I don ´ t want to sleep . Bad dreams ? My mom told you about that ? I was a kid once . I used to be terrified of the dark . Yeah . Sometimes I have nightmares . I bet everybody expects you to be brave just like your dad . That ´ s kinda hard . I bet your dad is brave , isn ´ t he ? He sure is . Nothing scares him . Nothing ? I bet he gets scared about you . - That ´ s different . - No , it ´ s not . I think that everybody is scared of something . It ´ s just a question of what you ´ re scared of . Is your dad brave ? No . Not really . I gotta go do some stuff . I ´ ll check you in a minute . Excuse me . I ´ m Michelle Novack . Do you know where my husband is ? He went below decks , ma ´ am . I ´ m sure there ´ s nothing to worry . He ´ ll be back in a minute . This way . Nothing this way ! Check over there ! She ´ s in here ! Stay with her . You ´ re alright now . You ´ ll be alright now . - ls she here yet ? - Who ? I don ´ t know . - Michelle ! Help me ! - ls she alright ? I think so . Have the doctor look at her . - Why aren ´ t you with Johnny ? He ´ s fine . He ´ s ... I need you to stay with him . Johnny ? Johnny ? Johnny ? So what do we got on this guy ? No record . He lives with his mom . - You say " Psycho " , didn ´ t you ? Very funny . He ´ s the last crew member on Kurt ´ s list . The door ´ s open . Let yourself in . - Mrs . Shaw ? - l ´ m in here . If you don ´ t mind . Mrs. Shaw , I ´ m Special Agent ... That battle where the man said that about whites of their eyes ? - Bunker Hill , I think . - Bunker Hill . Yes , you ´ re correct . Custer ´ s last stand . The correct answer was Bunker Hill . Very good . Not many young people know these things . Now , what was it that you want ? We ´ d like to ask a few questions about your son , Justin . Was he in an accident ? The plane ? No , it ´ s nothing like that . I worry about him sometimes . All that flying . He ´ s a good boy . I ´ m sure he is , Mrs. Shaw . That ´ s why we want to talk to you . She ´ s seen the killer , Doc . I ´ ll need to question her . You can try but you won ´ t get any answers . She ´ s in shock . - You can ´ t give her something ? - I will . But it ´ ll make her sleep . Johnny ´ s gone ! I told him not to leave his set . Michelle , you shouldn ´ t have left him alone . He wasn ´ t alone . I asked that steward ... - Justin to keep an eye on him . - ls everything okay folks ? - Where is my son ? - He ´ s fine , sir . Mrs. Novack , I ´ ve been keeping an eye on him . He said he was bored and he didn ´ t feel like taking a nap . Dean has electronic games so he went back there to pick one out . I hope that ... Dean , where ´ s my son ? Your son ? I ´ m sorry , I don ´ t know who your son is . Justin said that you brought my son down here ... to give him one of your electronic games . Now where is he ? I don ´ t handle the first class passengers , sir . I don ´ t know why he ´ d say that . You ´ re coming with me . Let ´ s go . - I need you to wait here . - l ´ ll keep looking . - Girlfriend ? Someone ... - Someone else ? Of course not . He takes care of me . That is what a son does . A good son . It is at the least he could do a ... After what ? It was an accident , just an accident . He put you in this wheelchair , didn ´ t he ? You don ´ t think he deliberately pushed me down the stairs , do you ? You ´ re saying it was an accident ? I was seeing a man . Justin was ten . We had an argument . I ´ m in a wheelchair . He has always blamed me for his father leaving . I ´ d like to take a look at your son ´ s room . My son is somewhere on this plane ! If I have to comb every inch of this plane , I ´ m going to find him ! But it ´ s not going to take that long , is it , Dean ? Because you ´ re going to tell me where he is . Right now ! This is crazy ! It ´ s a plane , sir . How could he possibly be missing ? You ´ re not making a mess in there , I hope ! - We ´ re barking up the wrong tree . - Yeah , well , just keep barking . I want you to leave everything exactly the way you found it ! - Hi Michelle . - Where is my son ? Funny . It ´ s exactly what I wanted to talk to you about . If you go into the galley there ´ s an elevator there . Get on it , come downstairs . We ´ ll have a little family reunion . - You love Johnny , don ´ t you ? - Of course I do . Then you won ´ t bring your husband . That would be very bad for Johnny ´ s health . See you . We ´ re not going to play this game anymore . Now stop lying . Lying ? Why would I lie to you , sir ? You ´ re quick to pin the blame that passenger on Carl Reese . - I was trying to help you there ! - I want to know where my son is ! - What ´ s going on here ? - Stay out of this , Captain . Dean knows where my son is . He ´ s going to tell me right now . I don ´ t know anything about it , Captain ! I swear ! You think Dean killed all these women ? And now he ´ s taken your son ? What women ? What are you talking about ? I can vouch for Dean . I ´ ve done over a hundred flights with him . What about Justin ? - I can ´ t tell you a thing about him . - Why not ? He keeps to himself . No one knows anything about his personal life . He stays here . You don ´ t let him out of your sight . Stay here ! Miss , do you know where Justin is ? - He ´ s not up here . - What about my wife ? No , I ´ m sorry . Billy , check this out . There ´ s only two piece missing . That ´ s all he needs to complete the set . What happens then ? It ´ s called , compulsive-pattern completion . When he gets the last piece , it ´ s over . What do you mean , over ? - Where am I ? - Had a nice nap , did we ? - I want my mom . - Who doesn ´ t ? - Give me my son ! - Mom ! It ´ s okay , baby . Mommy ´ s here . Hello , Mrs. Novack . Came alone ? Smart girl . You have me now . You don ´ t need him . Let him go . No , no , I do need him . And I need his daddy , too . - Why ? - What ´ s a family without a daddy ? - l ´ m not afraid of you ! - Tough guy all of the sudden ? Please , please don ´ t hurt my son . - My dad ´ s gonna get you ! - Well he better hurry up . What ´ s the problem ? ! Auto pilot ! We can ´ t disconnect ! Try again ! Still nothing ! Can ´ t do automatic ? No dice ! Give me a hand with the phone . I don ´ t know what ´ s overpowering this thing ! - Try to hold again ! - Nothing ! - Try break speed . - Still nothing ! You ´ re not going to tell me you ´ re still not scared , huh ? How about you , Mom ? Are you scared ? See ? I told you , I told you , everybody is scared of something . Now we ´ re just waiting for daddy . Hold on , baby ! Hold on ! Mayday , Mayday , Mayday , this is Oceanic flight 816 . Emergency at thirty-five thousand . We ´ re heading zero-nine-zero . Mayday , Mayday , Mayday ... What do you mean you can ´ t reach them ? How can their radio ... Well , keep trying . - What the hell is going on ? - The computer ´ s gone crazy . I got no control . The whole system has gone down . It ´ s Justin . He ´ s underneath No , radio . We ´ ve lost all communication . - l ´ m going down ! - Hold on ! He ´ s got my wife and child ! I ´ m going with you . If we can get to the F.M.S. , I can reprogram it . Lot-tech . It ´ s the only communication we ´ ve got . It ´ s open . He must ´ ve gone down this way . He ´ s expecting us . Climb down ! Start with the computer . We know he ´ s been there . Oh , man , this guy knows his stuff . Bypassing the auto pilot is no easy thing . Maybe I can patch something , hell , he ´ s got the control unit . It ´ s leveling out . I can tell you , he ´ s doing it , not us . You stay with it . I ´ m gonna try to find him . Okay . Making any progress , Novack ? I ´ ve been waiting to hear from you , Justin . Where ´ s my wife and son ? You sure took long enough figuring this all out , Novack . I just wanted to say goodbye . - You taking this aircraft down ? - How did you guess ? - Then you don ´ t need them . - You don ´ t either , Novack . Besides , they ´ re having fun with me . Dad , help ! Justin ! Justin , keep talking . What are you getting so excited about , Novack ? Your kid was talking out of turn . I had to stop that now , didn ´ t l ? Keep talking , Justin , so I can find you and settle this thing . It ´ s going to be settle , Novack . I ´ m just having a little fun . So what ´ s your story , Justin ? You were abused ? What , the big F.B.I. man took some psychology classes . Dad ! I ´ m just trying to figure you out . Who was it , your father ? I ´ m not playing this game , Novack . Was it your mother ? Mrs. Novack please stand back or I ´ ll snap his neck , I promise ! You hear me ? Mrs. Novack , please ! Give me my son . Let him go . She must ´ ve been some piece of work , your mother . You can ´ t kill her so you ´ re killing al these other women , huh ? - I take care of my mother . - l ´ ve seen that , Justin . Comb her hair ? You lay her out nice ? Just shut up , Novack ! Shut up ! You know you don ´ t get it at all , Novack , do you ? You had it way too easy , Kurt . You listening to me ? Kurt , do you hear ... Dad ! Hello , Justin . No ! Don ´ t . Maybe Johnny wanna try his luck in the water before we go down ! - Don ´ t do it Justin ! - Another step and he goes down ! - Dad ! - Don ´ t worry ! The offer still stands , Justin . Me for them . What do you say ? Don ´ t listen to her , Justin . This is between you and me . Don ´ t do it ! It ´ s never going to be over until we work this out . C ´ mon , me for them . That ´ s what you want . I press the button , the plane goes down right now ! What ´ s the matter , Justin ? You don ´ t like it face-to-face ? - lt ´ s not your style , is it ? - Getting scared now , aren ´ t you ? You like sneaking up on women . That ´ s something you can handle . Shut up ! Shut up ! This is between you and me ! You let my son go ! Justin ! Let my son go ! Dad !

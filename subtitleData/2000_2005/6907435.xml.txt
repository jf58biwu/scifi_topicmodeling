Go to space and ... Go and do what ? Like last time , if our voices reach Moriyama 's heart I think it 'll work out somehow . Like last time ... But ... You mean , the last Sanadon ? Yeah . You can do it , Nayuta Moriyama ! You can do it ! You can do it ! You 're going to go to space to cheer her on ? That 's ridiculous . I appreciate how you feel , but Murata ... We 're not going to cheer for her , we 're going to be a sign for her . A sign ? Nayuta , who has been incorporated with the Shingu 's power can use that as a guide to come home , like last time . That is a brilliant idea . Grandpa . Hey . It might be a brilliant idea , but there 's no way Murata can go to space . We don 't have a space shuttle and he 's not able to jump to space like Muryou . That 's why I 'll take him . I 'm sure I can take Murata 's heart with me . It seems as though Jiltosh is having trouble keeping his calm while he 's fighting against Mugen . The visuals aren 't coming in like before . Myouken , why don 't you show us instead ? I guess I have no choice . This is amazing ! This is my point of view . It 's rather difficult for me to show it at an audience 's point of view like Jiltosh . Are you also a ... Ten thousand years ago , I fought against Jiltosh , Mugen and Asougi several times . Asougi . Is everyone ready ? Yeah ! Is this really gonna work ? Shun ! Doubt isn 't an option now ! Yes ! I 'll abandon my doubts ! You really are reckless ! You 're not even a native of Tenmo . It 's okay , ' cause I 'm the class rep . Hey , someone take his cushions away ! Murata , let 's do it ! Yes ! Subaru ! Are you ready ? Yup ! Ready when you are ! On your mark ... Ready ... Gather your power to the whirl of the spiral ! Whoa ... Murata , Subaru is coming ! Good luck ! Good luck ! Good luck ! Good luck ! Good luck ! Good luck ! Hajime ! Muryou ! Take care of Nayuta and Hajime ! We 're counting on you ! Come , Subaru ! Catch ! Muryou ! What is that ? It 's moving at an unbelievable speed ! Oh , that 's my son and his friend . They 're going to go save their friend . Is Ha-chan okay ? There 's nothing to worry about . Muryou is with him . But according to this , Moriyama and Mr. Aloha are outside the solar system . I can 't even believe that they 're going all the way out there , but how are they going to get back ? You 're always so calm . I 'm just not as careless as you . Say what ? By the way , your spiral idea was a very good one . Good ? Oh that was Kyoichi 's idea . It wasn 't an idea ! It was inspiration ! Same thing . Same thing . Inspiration is something that you obtain through continued daily effort . I see you 've grown as well . Huh ? Well ... The rest is up to Nayuta ... The Earth 's fate will be decided by her actions . The absolute justice , the absolute truth ... The absolute existence that can take people 's lives or even destroy a whole planet in his name ... The Magistrate . You seem to know a lot . I investigated it . Good for you . I also investigated about you and Jiltosh . Oh . After your big brother lost control of his power the one who took his life was Jiltosh , the Hero from Planet Velunn . My brother isn 't dead . They 're thirty light-years away . Even I can 't see that . Thirty light years ? What is going to happen ? That would depend on Ve-yan . It is up to the Magistrate . Wait ! Please wait ! Wait ! Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Are you all right , Murata ? Y ... Yeah ... I knew you 'd come . You two really do make a great team ... But it 's too late . Nayuta 's body and heart were absorbed by the power of the Shingu . Moriyama ! Moriyama ! Ten thousand years ago , a man named Mugen fought against a great enemy battleship . He released his power and blew away an entire galaxy . Grandpa told me . My sister didn 't tell me anything though . I 'm sure . The Shingu is what has become of the man who was once Mugen . His heart , his body , everything had turned into a mass of energy . This is only a fraction ... The power Nayuta used was only a fraction of the Shingu 's power . The main power is ... Is buried deep beneath Tenmo Mountain . We hid the Shingu there , and ... Asougi hid his spaceship in the sacred mountain . You hid it ? How do you hide something like that ? The power that heads out is also a power that heads in . I sort of twisted that . Twisted that ? Yes . Nayuta twisted the power heading outwards to inwards by turning into the Shingu and fighting . So did Momoe , and the one before her . Everyone who turned into the Shingu did . By turning it inwards , it takes form . By turning it outwards it loses its form . Meaning , it 's like turning your back to a flood or facing it ? Oh , you 're pretty good . Mugen and Nayuta faced the tide and were swept away by it . Is this the tide ? What are you going to do now ? I have to twist it inwards again at the source of the spread . If it 's already spread throughout the Earth and the solar system , won 't they be destroyed ? Well , it will be a huge explosion . Planets that get engulfed by the explosion will turn into stardust . You 're right , but that 's something that can 't be helped . To cancel the power of the Shingu , this needs to be repeated . I have to diffuse it little by little and lessen the total amount . It sounds like a long and arduous process , but it 's the only way . It 's the only way ? But what about Earth ? Then what 's the purpose of the people of Tenmo ? Well , metaphorically speaking , they 're the twist ... They 're the handle of a faucet ... and the Earth is the water tank . Moriyama isn 't a tool ! Neither is grandmother Sanemori , nor anyone else ... Setsuna wished this , and she became the Keeper of Earth . To atone for her brother 's crime ... Her clan is the ancestors of the people of Tenmo . They wed the people of Earth , gave birth , and thus became the guardians of the Shingu . In the end , their methods were unable to control the power of the Shingu . Then why did you come to Earth ? It was a promise . A promise ? A promise to see their attempt through . Originally Asougi was on our side , but he chose to live the same time as a woman from Earth . I guess that was also another choice . Thank you for explaining so many things . I kind of get the idea now . Do you ? Basically , if we do something about the flow of this energy , the Earth will be saved ... And there won 't be a need for you to make a second and third people of Tenmo . Is that what you 're saying ? I 'm going to save Moriyama . It 's useless . She 's already ... It 's going to be all right . I 'm going to find Moriyama . That 's impossible . You can 't do that . I don 't have powers like you or Muryou , but I can sense the flow . I can sense Moriyama . Moriyama , if you can hear me , answer me ! Moriyama ! Hajime . Hajime . Hajime . The tide has turned ... Isn 't this what you really wanted ? What ? For Moriyama ... No ... For the people of Earth to take in the power of the Shingu and move on to the next level . But , it didn 't happen . Not yet at least . I believe in those two . Who are you ? Did you feel it ? Yes . A great sparkle , thirty light years away ... What happened ? You guys will be able to see it in thirty years . It 's the birth of a new future . Future ? Then , does that mean ... Let 's go ! Hajime ! Ha-chan ! Huh ? Welcome home . Welcome home . Hey . It 's another handshake . Hey ! What the heck ! You 're over there ? Hi . Not too popular , are you ? Well , can 't be helped , can it ? How were you able to find Nayuta ? Earlier , when the Shingu fought near Mars ... I felt the tide while holding her hand . The tide ? The power of Shingu ... The flow of Moriyama 's power . That feeling stayed with me . That 's why I was able to find her , and Moriyama was probably ... Probably what ? I was looking for you too . Whoo ! You two ! Hey ! I guess living a long life doesn 't always make you wise . Did you finally realize that ? Who would ever want to admit that ? As the Magistrate , I hereby declare the Galactic Federation and the Cosmos Alliance should have further talks pertaining to Earth . Earth has obviously shown signs that it is ready to evolve to the next level . Thus , I prohibit further investigation of this planet as an undeveloped planet . How 's that , guys ? Can we really believe what you said ? Oh man . It 's fine . You can trust me . Actually , I want you to trust me . I say that with respect and with friendship towards Earth . Jiltosh ... Huh ? By the way , where 's Muryou ? I have a bad feeling . Meaning ? This is great ! This is great ! Okay , everyone ! Turn this way ! Huh ? It seems very lively . You guys are all amazing . Off we go ! Off we go . Take care . Sushi Sasaya Sushi Sasaya A few days passed . Sushi Sasaya Sushi Sasaya There was no longer a need to join the Federation or Alliance in such a hurry . Sushi Sasaya Sushi Sasaya Thus , the leisurely , peaceful days with the aliens would continue . But now , everyone knows about the people of Tenmo , the Galactic Federation , the Cosmos Alliance and the aliens . That 's why we can 't be like we were but that 's why we 're going to move forward . We won 't , can 't and mustn 't retrace our steps . Are the Federation and Alliance actually friends ? leyoshi Tokugawa ! Mr. So , cut it out . How peaceful ... Hey , Muryou . What is it ? So , who are you really ? Why are you asking that now ? I 'm asking because it is now . It doesn 't matter anymore , you know , after all that . All that ? Yeah , all that . Are you an alien too ? Like Asougi and Setsuna ? No , I 'm not . Really ? Truthfully , I ... Truthfully ... ? The first thing I remember , is being right there . Let 's just leave it at that . W ... Wait ! Wait up Muryou ! What are those two doing ? Hey ! You two ! We have the Cultural Festival and final exams coming up ... Needless to say , the Space Diplomacy issue too , and then winter break . Our battles would still continue , but this is where the story ends . So until next time , we 'll just leave it at that .

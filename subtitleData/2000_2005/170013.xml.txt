 Nandy ! Nandy ! Get inside . Go . - We ain 't open for business . - Shut up , whore . You we don 't trade with at all , Rans Burgess . You 're no longer welcome . You 've been told that . I 've been told a great many things . I 'm here for what 's mine . Ain 't nothing here belongs to you . You don 't get gone , we 'll be well within our rights to drop you . Only rights you got are the ones I give you . - Find the girl ! - She ain 't here . Girl left this moon more than a month ago . It was you chased her off . Petaleen ! It 's a good thing you haven 't left with my baby . - This baby ain 't yours . - So you keep saying . If this DNA is a match with mine know I will be back for my baby . And if I have to , I 'll cut it out of you . All right , now , it 'll all work out . - He 'll do it too . He 'll do what he says . - No , he won 't . We won 't allow it . - How we gonna stop him ? - We 'll get help , that 's how . Help ? There 's not a soul on this moon go up against Rans Burgess . - She 's right . - Ain 't nobody strong enough . And even if there was , who 'd help us ? Hi . Sorry . Didn 't mean to startle you . You didn 't . I was just ... That 's more like a , it 's a warrior-like , strikes fear into the hearts of ... You know , not altogether wise , sneaking up on a fellow when he 's handling his weapon . - Sure . I 've heard that said . But perhaps the dining area isn 't the place for this sort of thing . What ? It 's the only place with a table big enough . Of course . In that case , every well-bred petty crook knows small , concealable weapons always go to the far left of the place setting . Got a distress call coming in . Some folks asking for help . Really ? Folks asking for help from us petty crooks . - Well ... - I should take that right away . Well , it 's for her . Huh ? The call 's for Inara . - I 'll take it in my shuttle . - I 'll send it there . This distress wouldn 't happen to be taking place in someone 's pants , would it ? And I got word you were in the area . I 'm imposing , but I got no one else to ask . It sounds like something this crew can handle . I can 't guarantee they 'll handle it particularly well , but ... - lf they 've got guns and brains at all ... - They 've got guns . Payment won 't be a problem . We just ain 't equipped for this . - Nandy , it 's gonna be all right . - The house would tell you not to come . I know they ordered you to shun me when I left . I would have waived you long ago . It 's just ... It doesn 't matter . Who ' d have thought we 'd end up way out here ? Who 'd have thought ? - Let me know what your people say ? - Of course . I 'll wait to hear from you . And you . I suppose you heard most of that . Only because I was eavesdropping . - Your friend sounds like she 's in trouble . - She is . And there 's no authority on that moon she can go to . They 're totally alone . Some men might take advantage of that . One man . She 's looking for someone to come and explain things to him ? That 's essentially it , yes . A whole houseful of companions . How are they fixed for payment ? They 're not companions . They 're whores . Thought you didn 't care for that word . It applies . They 're not registered with the guild . They 're ... - Independent ? - Yes . If you agree to do this you 'll be compensated . I 'll see to it . - I 've put a little aside ... - Keep your money . I won 't be needing no payment . Mal . Thank you . I 'll contact Nandy at once . But you will be paid . I feel it 's important that we keep ours strictly a business arrangement . - I 'll speak with the crew . - Good . Those who have a mind are welcome to join . Those who 'd just as soon stay on the ship can do that too . Don 't see the benefit , getting involved in a stranger 's troubles without an up-front price . These people need assistance . The benefit wouldn 't necessarily be for you . - That 's what I 'm saying . - No one 's gonna force you to go . As stated , this job is strictly speculative . Good . Don 't know these folks , don 't care to . - They 're whores . - I 'm in . Wash , plot a course . - That 's the whorehouse ? - Yes . How come it looks like a frozen dinner pack ? Solar sheeting . Cheap power . Hope the whores are prettier than the house . - Nandy , darling . - It 's so good to see you . - You look wonderful . - You look exactly the same . - How do you do that out here ? - Sheer force of will . - This is Malcolm Reynolds . - I appreciate your coming . Well , any friend of Inara 's is a strictly business-like relationship of mine . This is my first mate , Zoe . I 'll introduce you to the rest later . - Can I start getting sexed already ? - Well , that one 's kind of horrific . - Can we talk business ? - In here . The rest of you there 's food and some liquor at the sideboard . Make yourselves at home . Look , they got boy whores . Isn 't that thoughtful ? - I wonder if they service girl folk at all ? - Let 's not ask . Isn 't there a pregnant woman to examine ? You 'd really lie with someone being paid for it ? Well , it 's not like anyone else is lining up to , you know , examine me . Whoo ! My John Thomas is about to pop off and fly around there 's so much tasty in here ! Would be you 'd get your most poetical about your pecker . - You 'd be the doctor ? - Yes . - This is Petaleen . - Yes , sir . She 's feeling a might weak right now . - Well , let 's get you lying down . - Now that 's a plan . - Shepherd ? - No , thank you . We were hoping we might have a prayer meeting . We ain 't had one in months , except what Emma here reads out on Sundays . The last shepherd to come by was springtime , he only read one passage . And he took it out in trade off both of us . Everyone 's got somebody . Wash , tell me I 'm pretty . Were I unwed , I would take you in a manly fashion . - Because I 'm pretty ? - Because you 're pretty . I take it reason doesn 't enter into this . Not with Rans Burgess . The man is a taker . - You think the kid is his ? - I think it 's Petaleen 's . But the blood test . Well , he did favor Petaleen pretty exclusively , but she had others . Fifty-fifty , not that it matters . The man ain 't fit to raise a cactus plant . His barren prairie shrew can 't bear him an heir so he takes it into his head to pull it out of us . Not gonna happen . - I see that 's the case . - And you see the way we live here . Go into town , it 's the same . Some places come up rustic because they ain 't got more than basics . Rans Burgess has money enough to build a city , a real community . Keeps people living like this so he can play cowboy be the one with the best toys . Turn this moon into a gorram theme park . Someone stands up to him ... He means to burn me out . Yeah , he sounds like a fun guy . I 'd like to meet him . This won 't be solved with talk . When I 'm gonna fight a man , it helps to size him up . - Well , he 'll be at the theater tonight . - And so will I. Inara . Think you can stoop to being on my arm ? Will you wash it first ? So I told the boy , " You take a clean woman 's virtue , you take the woman . And that 's for life ! " And the boy said his vows right then . Took very little persuading on my part . It 's nice to know there 's some places left where old-fashioned values still mean a thing . - Isn 't that right , dear ? - Mm . - I don 't think I know you . - Name 's Malcolm , Malcolm Reynolds . And might I just say , she is quite a beauty . Well , thank you . Ever had occasion to handle one of these , Mr. Reynolds ? Silk trigger , active return bolt laser . - It 's lighter than it looks . - Don 't let that fool you . Won 't find technology like that short of Alliance . And even their issues don 't have the auto-target adjust . I had that crafted special . Didn 't think weapons such as this were generally legal . For a private owner . My husband makes a distinction between legality and morality , Mr. Reynolds . - I 've said that myself . - Bending one unjust law is small when it comes to protecting one 's family . - I think I understand you . - And as you say , she is a beauty . She sure is . Of course , I was referring to the lady . Ma 'am . Yes ? - Well ? - Well what ? You said you wanted to look him in the eye . You 've done that . - So , what 's the plan ? - We get back to Serenity and we get off this rock just as fast as we can . And there can be no mistake ? Good . - Rans ? - The DNA matches . The child is mine . We run . Math just don 't add up . Our weapon stores aren 't exactly overpowering and I don 't much like what we 'd be up against . Nothing worse than a monster who thinks he 's right with God . I turn Burgess away once and he 'll keep coming . Won 't stop till he gets what he thinks is his . - So we run . - I understand , Capt. Reynolds . You have your people to think of , same as me . And this ain 't your fight . I don 't believe you do understand , Nandy . I said we run . " We " . My people , your people , and whatever bits of precious you got in this house you can 't bear to part with . We load up Serenity and we leave Burgess in the dust . It took me years to cut this piece of territory out of other men 's hands to build this from nothing . - Nandy ... It 's who I am , and it 's my home . I 'm not going anywhere . He 'll kill you . He 'll kill every last one of them , it comes to that . - And he 'll sleep well that night . - Rans Burgess is just a man . And I won 't let any man take what 's mine . I doubt you 'd do different in my position . Well , lady , I must say you 're my kind of stupid . Hell , he ain 't expecting much of a fight . Might be we catch him with his drawers low . He 'll probably ride in by daylight . But I figure , three-point watch , say four-hour shift just to be on the safe side . - Three-point , Four-hour should do it . - I 'm fair handy with a hammer . That so , Shepherd ? Been following the footsteps of a carpenter some time now . I can do something about our fortifications . Okay , then . We start shooting he 'll most like try to burn us out , save sweat and bullets . - Nandy , what 's the water supply like ? - Underground well . Pump that draws it up 's antiquated , but don 't break down . Kaylee , think you can swing an upgrade ? I 'll talk to Serenity , see what she 's got . - Good . We might ... - Starting ! - And that it is , but time ... - Dr. Tam ? Oh , it 's starting ! Okay ! Okay , it 's starting ! All right . Everybody relax , be calm . Nobody panic ! Everything 's gonna be okay ! - I got this one , captain . - Thanks . Okay . Okay , then . Let 's get to work , people ! The girls and I have been talking , Shepherd . We 've been discussing what we 'd like said over us if we should fall . No . I only bury the dead , child . No one here 's gonna die . There 's people gonna die . And with people dying , comes guts and screaming . That can bring on screwed-up behavior , a person ain 't used to it . When the time comes , most important thing , keep your wits about you . Clear ? All right . These are my favorites . You 're to keep them coming . I shoot , I run out , you hand me the next biggest one , and so on . - Is there an understanding here ? - Yes . Alrighty then , let 's get to work . All I 'm saying is that we 're living in the rough and tumble and don 't see that changing soon . - Nor do I. Not sure now is the best time to bring a tiny , helpless person into our lives . That excuse is getting a little worn , honey . It 's not an excuse , dear . It 's objective assessment . I can 't help that it stays relevant . I don 't give a good gorram about relevant , Wash . Or objective . And I ain 't so afraid of losing something that I ain 't gonna try to have it . You and I would make one beautiful baby . And I wanna meet that child one day . Period . Y 'all are pulling , not squeezing like I said . Next one don 't hit that board is giving up a special treat . That man 's gonna use up our credit before we 've earned it . After you 've saved our lives , you can do some chores maybe . - I 'm a fair hand with a mop . - So your legend tells . Truth is , I expected more of you to be taking payment in our trade . Well , we 're not a conglomeration . Got a preacher , married fella , and the doctor well , he 'd have to relax for 30 seconds to get his play . That 'd be more or less a miracle . These are fetching pieces . Any of them work ? Don 't got many rounds for the chaplain there , but the rest 'll be of use . - This is my favorite . - What 's its history ? Violence and crime , sad to say . - What about you ? - Similar . No , I mean when are you planning to avail yourself of some of our trade ? - My girls is clean and kind-spirited . - Well , I got the job on my mind . After , I 'm sure I 'll trade . They 're a fine bunch . You ain 't looked at one of them as long or loving as you looked at those pistols . You 're not sly , are you ? Because I got my boys . Sly ? No . I lean toward women folk . Just , one thing at a time . Never liked complications . Oh , I 'm certain of that . - Something to be smiling at ? - I trained as a companion , remember ? - I read people pretty well . - Well , that 's nice for you . She 's a hell of a woman , ain 't she ? Inara . Yeah , she 's a cherry blossom , no denying . Expect you know her better , coming up together and all . Imagine I do . She ever tell you why she left Soonal ? - Never asked . - Yes , you did . And I don 't know my own self . I was gone long before . And I 'll tell you , it was a shock , her leaving . She was special . There 's 40 women in House Madrassa , and you 'd pick her out in a second . Could 've been House Priestess , few years ' time . - Is that right ? - Had her eyes on it too . Very focused . She 's like you , more than a little . And how exactly is that ? She hates complications . They do crop up though , don 't they ? Such is life . You 're not completely dilated yet . Don 't try to force it , the contractions are still preliminary . - What 's he saying ? - It 's gonna be a little while , sweetie . But it hurts ! This child wants to be born , I know it ! Can you get the green vial from my bag ? We can dull the pain some . How many babies have you actually delivered ? As a primary , this 'll be the first . You ? - My first too . - Mine too . - It 's gonna be a long night . - You 'll do great , doctor . Who do you think is in there ? It was the dulcimer . The dulcimer drove you out of Soonal ? Did you kill a dulcimer in a terrible passion ? Actually , yes . And now that dulcimer 's family is out to get even , I get it . I was at practice . You never stop practicing , you know , not a true companion . Some baroque piece , and the instructor keeps saying : " You 're playing it , not feeling it " . And the fifth time he said it , I took the damn thing and smashed it . And that 's when it occurred to me that a companion 's life might be a little too constricting . So I trucked out to the border , learned to say " ain 't " . Came to find work . Found this place . It 's a nice place . It was a dung-heap run by a pig who had half the girls strung-out on drops . There 's no guild out here . They let men run the houses , and they don 't ask for references . We didn 't get along . And where 's he at now ? Let 's just say he ain 't playing the dulcimer anymore either . You are a remarkable woman . If you don 't mind my saying . Well , as long as it 's you saying it and not my fine rice wine . It takes more than a few drinks to render my judgment blurry . What about you ? - Am I getting any prettier ? - By the minute . I should make sure everyone 's ready for ... Everyone 's asleep . Well , there 's them that can 't night before a fight . Can you ? - What ? - Sleep . Listen , Nandy , I have a confession to make . Maybe I should get the Shepherd . Well , I ain 't sinned yet . And I 'd feel a little more than awkward if he were here when I did . You expect to accomplish something sinful then , do you ? If I 'm overstepping my bounds , let me know . Malcolm , I 've been waiting for you to kiss me since I showed you my guns . You okay with this ? I 'm just waiting to see if I pass out . Long story . - I want you to bed me . - I guess I mean to . I ain 't her . Only people in this room are you and me . So my child how long has it been since your last confession ? - Longer than I care to say . - You remember where everything goes ? Let 's just say I plan to take it real slow . So the whore 's got herself a champion , has she ? - This great man got a name ? - Reynolds . Malcolm Reynolds . Yes , I 've met the man . - How many has he got with him ? - Just a few . And only two real fighters besides himself . But they got the girls stirring for a battle . I certainly wasn 't expecting a battle . Seems the Heart of Gold 's got itself a few mercenaries . Guess we best call the whole thing off . Earned yourself quite a bag of silver , little kitten . But I got a few more chores in mind before you get it . I 'm ready . Now , Shahri here she understands a whore 's place , don 't she ? But Nandy and those others , they spit on our town . They 've no respect for the sanctity of fatherhood or decency or family ! They have my child , held hostage to their decadent ways , and that I will not abide ! We will show them what power is ! We will show them what their position in this town is ! Let us all remember , right here and now , what a woman is to a man ! Get on your knees . - Well . - I just had to tell Nandy about ... About time to ... - Big fight today . - Mal , please . No , well , I , no ... You know , I was up , I got ... So you took to bed with Nandy . I 'm glad . - Glad ? - Yes . She 's a dear friend , and probably in need of comfort now . Well ... One of the virtues of not being puritanical about sex is not feeling embarrassed afterwards . You should look into it . Well , I just didn 't want you thinking that I was taking advantage of your friend . She 's well worth taking advantage of . I sincerely hope you did . So you 're okay . Well , yeah , why wouldn 't you be ? I wouldn 't say I 'm entirely okay . I 'm a little appalled at her taste . Wash , you there yet ? All but . - Nice day for a last stand , eh ? - Nope . Plan to make a few stands after this . Just hoping for air support from your quarter . Couple of low flyovers , engines tipped earthward at full-blast . Should give our guests something other than killing you to think about . What I like to hear . Out . Malcolm seem a little funny to you at breakfast this morning ? Come on , Kaylee . We all know I 'm the funny one . You ladies and gentlemen all locked and loaded ? - Yes , sir . - Good . Remember shoot the man , not the horse . Dead horse is cover . Live horse , pile of panic . Now , girl , that is just plain dirty . You are aware your radio 's transmitting . Because I don 't feel particularly girlish or dirty at the moment . Yeah , just up here waiting , captain . Ready , 100 percent . Better be . You 're stronger than this thing . I can feel it in your grip . Petaleen , look at me . This is just a moment in time . Step aside and let it happen . - How is she , doctor ? - She 's at 10 centimeters . Not long now . Inara , I thought it was just him that ... Nandy , believe me , I 'll be fine . Morning . - How are you doing ? - A might tense . I 'd like you on the balcony with me . See everyone from there ... - You didn 't give me the whole truth . - About what ? About her feelings for you . - I really don 't know ... - Looks like imminent violence ! Zoe , Jayne , you seeing this ? Gotta be 30 men out there . Confirm that . Plus a mounted gun on that hovercraft . What 's that you said about running for it ? Okay , folks ! We got no shortage of ugly riding in on us . But that don 't change the plan . Anybody goes down , drag them to the back and get back to shooting . Only way to help them 's to finish this . Wash , we 'll be trading injuries in under two minutes . I 'd like my sky a bit less empty . Copy that , Mal . We ... Open her up ! Cover ! Jayne , I do believe that 's our first hurdle . You might ... I think I might , captain . Fire ! What have I done ? Go ! Wash ! Where the hell is my spaceship ? Rotten lasers ! Book ! Zoe ! Second hurdle ! That 's it , Petaleen . One more push . That 's the shoulders ! Good ! Jayne ? I lost visual on Burgess ! Same here . Take to right ! Hey ! There he is ! Get him ! Come on , let 's get him ! Try the other side ! Got you ! Open this door ! Nobody 's going anywhere . - It 's ... - It 's a boy . Healthy . Good morning , Petaleen . How 's my boy ? No ! Rans . Most of your men are either dead , dying or run off . That don 't matter none . I got what I came here for . - Ain 't leaving here with it . - This is my blood , woman ! No ! This is your blood ! Now you hand that child over nice and slow or I 'll spill more than you can spare . - You 're gonna pay for what you 've took . - She was just a whore ! Petaleen ! You bring my baby out right now ! You hear me ? I wanna see my son ! Rans , this is Jonah . Jonah , say hi to your daddy . Say goodbye to your daddy , Jonah . Go on ! Go on home ! You go with them . I think those girls 'll do all right . She taught them well . Yeah . I 'm glad you were with her , her last night . - I am . - Yeah , well , I ain 't . Hell , I wish I never met her . Then I wouldn 't have failed her . That wasn 't the way of it . That 's a kindness . But nothing you say will convince me different . Well , I 'm still glad . So you weren 't before ? Inara . I ain 't looking for anything from you . I 'm just ... Just feeling kind of truthsome right now . And , uh ... And life 's just too damn short for ifs and maybes . I learned something from Nandy . Not just from what happened , but from her . The family she made the strength of her love for them , it 's what kept them together . When you live with that kind of strength you get tied to it . You can 't break away . And you never want to . There 's something ... There 's something I should have done a long while ago . And I 'm sorry for both of us , that it took me this long . I 'm leaving .

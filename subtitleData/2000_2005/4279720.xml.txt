 * I 'm in heaven ... * Ethan , I don 't think it 's going to clear up anytime soon . I don 't think it 's going to last that long . It 's not raining that hard . It was so nice this morning . Yeah . It 'll clear up . And if it doesn 't , we 'll just have a picnic in the car . No , Daddy . I want to go outside and play . Oh , no , you 're going to get all wet , sweetie . Maybe later . Please ? It 's a very light shower . Please ? I won 't get wet . Please ? Okay . Yay ! But just for a minute . Okay . And I want you to come right back . I promise . Have fun . I will . We treated you as an equal . That wasn 't good enough for you . You had to cross the line . I 'd put in for a transfer if I were you . So , where you two going for dinner ? Chez Michael 's . That 's going to set you back . Elizabeth has been married to me for 35 years . She deserves a nice meal . Have a good evening , Orson . God bless . Oh , you need to slow down , cousin . I 'm not driving back into town for another six pack . You 're just afraid my dad will kick your ass if I come home smelling like beer . Evil cousin Shawn- - that 's me . Corrupter of the innocent . That next door neighbor of yours , what 's-her-name ? She seems ready for some corruption . You mean Nikki ? She 's 14 , Kyle . 14 ? Yeah . Hmm . Hmm . Now , would it be fair to say that this comet is close in size to Haley 's comet , or is it a little bigger ? Well , actually , as far as comets go , this one 's a little smaller than Haley 's , but what makes this particularly interesting to us is how close it will pass by Earth . And what are the predictions on how close it will pass ? Hey , kiddo . WOMAN : Somewhere between two and five million miles . You 're missing the show . There 's a big comet . WOMAN : ... the distance from the sun to the Earth is about 93 million miles ... NASA says we 'll never see one closer in our lifetime . Yeah , I didn 't think that would work . MAN : ... appears to have little or no tail . WOMAN : Well , it 's a little unusual ... Hi . How is he ? The same . Same as always . Some of your mail 's still coming to the house . I 'll call the post office . Hi , baby . Haven 't seen you around here for the last couple of days . Can 't make it every day , not anymore . Not after three years . So what are we supposed to do , just give up on him ? I better go . Linda , just wait . Linda ! Linda . It 's not a competition , Tom . It 's not about who can sit by his side the longest . I still love him . I just can 't live here like you do . I know . I wasn 't accusing you . I saw you got a bill from Olympia Investigations . More pvate detectives ? I thought we were on to something . Someone matching Shawn 's description living down in Monterey . But it wasn 't him , was it ? Shawn can be anywhere . Even if you found him it wouldn 't wake Kyle up . At least I 'd have some answers . I 'm worried about you , Tom . Finding Shawn and figuring out what happened to our son , that is my job . How can you not know that ? You look tired . Try and get some rest . I thought we were supposed to be watching the comet . Oh , yeah , the comet . Is it supposed to be that bright ? Skouris here . Get over here . Now . This cannot be good . All right , listen up , everyone . We 're at DEFCON One . These envelopes are orders from Home Sec . Our first priority is secure SeaTac Airport , ground all the planes , gaer up all the foreign dignitaries in the greater metropolitan area . Get them , the local elected officials , take them all to the shelters in those orders . Someone bring me up to speed . Sid ? The comet . It 's not a fly-by anymore . It 's heading right at us . Sir , it just changed course and accelerated again . A comet cannot change course . This one has . Then it 's not a cot . Revised estimate of velocity is ... 3,000 kilometers a second . How much time do we have ? Impact in 28 minutes . Sir . Ryland . Understood . China just launched its missiles at it . Get ready , guys . We 're going next . There has been a launch . The U.S.ilitary has launched a volley of 24 Titan II missiles . Danny ... what 's going on ? All right . Our missiles are in the air . England has launched , too . France and Russia . NORAD 's saying the first flight of missiles will intercept in 15 seconds . Nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... Three ... two ... one . We should get inside . Multiple hits . I think they got it . NORAD is reporting that at least nine of the Titan II missiles have hit their target . It appears the comet has ... No effect . The comet is still headed right for us . How hard will it hit ? Something that big , that fast ? You don 't want to know . You don 't want to know . I 'm scared . I 'm going to go find my parents , okay ? Okay Hey , Dad ? If you 're there can you pick up the phone ? It 's Diana . You know , your daughter . Ju tell my brother that I love him . You tell Mommy that I love her , okay ? Nancy , it 's dad . I just wanted to tell you I love you . Catastrophic impact with Earth now appears unavoidable ... Tom , t 's Susan . What is going on ? ... Where and exactly when this now certain ... Tom , isn 't there a shelter we can go to ? I mean , technically you still work for Homeland Security , don 't you ? Susan , it doesn 't matter . The shelters aren 't going to make a damn bit of difference . Just ... I 'm sorry . I love you , sis . Just hug Danny close and pray for the best . Sir , British missiles just hit the object but it 's still coming . It 's entered the atmosphere . I got it on SeaTac radar . It 's slowing down . What ? It 's at Mach Seven , Mach Two . It 's going subsonic . It 's leveling off and continuing to lose speed . It 's as if it 's coming in for a landing . Landing ? Wha ... like ... Like a pla ? No , more like the mothership . Give me some coordinates . Where 's it going ? 47 North Longitude ; 122 , maybe 123 West Latitude . That 's by Mount Rainier . That 's our backyard . Come on , get the shot . Get the sh . We 're , we 're close to the base of Mount Rainier . The ball of light is massive ; 100 , 200 feet in diameter . It 's hard to tell . We 're going to try to get closer . I can tell you that this is , without a doubt , one of the most incredible sights I 've ever seen . We 're still looking for some sort of official that might be here from the government . Jim ? Jim , what 's going on ? We 're not sure what 's just happened . The ball of light is gone . Thousands of people have just suddenly appeared . This is amazing . There are thousands of people as far as the eye can see . I think I just ... I saw your brother . Shawn ? Yeah ! Pull me all the files from the Northern Counties . I want back in . Tom , do you have any idea what I 'm wading through here ? I have over 4,000 people that stepped out of a ball of light and landed in my lap . Somef them have been gone 60 years . None of them have any memory of what happened to them . You want me to drop everything because u want back in ? I can help . I needed help from you before . When Home Sec asked me who I wanted to bring over from the Bureau , your name was at the top of the list . What did I get from you ? Five months . Five months . And then an indefinite leave absence . You made fools out of both of us . I needed to find the truth about what happened toy son . And you still do . And that 's the reason you want back in ... because your nephew is one of the returnees . Look , I admit I have a personal stake in this . That 's why I 'll come through for you . I need answers , too . Diana Skouris . Tom Baldwin . You two will be one of the teams that 's responsible for investiging what happened to the returnees . Skouris , ex-CDC , right ? Yeah , I heard of you , too . You got to be kidding me , right ? Is there a problem ? He went MIA once . Who 's to say he won 't do it again ? Me . Is this where you give me the " Be a good soldier " speech ? No , this is ere I give you the speech about how you 're my best field scientist and Tom is my best lead investigator , and how together , you 're going to make a good team . Hmm . Well , should be interesting . Nice to meet you , too . Beautiful . The sooner we find out what 's going on , the better for us . The better for them . What 's your name again , sir ? Julius . Anita . Amanda . I want to see my family . ( speaks Spanish ) ( speaks German ) Orson Bailey . It 's not possible . Why ? It 's 1979 . So for them , no timeas passed . Last night was our anniversary . So between you and me , what do you think happened to them ? Where do you think they 've been ? I don 't know . There had to be some kind of ielligence behind it . As in the hand of God or little green men ? I 'm not discounting anything . Here , look . This is an interesting one . They 're dead , aren 't they ? This is Maia Rutledge . She was the first one to disappear as far as we can tell . She 's eight years old , only she was born in 1938 . I 'll be okay , mostly . She 's a tough little kid . Look , there 's one returnee I 'd like to interview myself . Yeah , so I 've been told . Returnee 2,117- - Shawn Farrell . He 's all yours . All we 're asking for is access . These people deserve to see their families . To receive legal representation . They 're private citizens who 've done nothing wrong . We don 't know that . It 's been less than a week . For all we know , these people could be walking time bombs , disease vectors , spies . Sent by who ? She doesn 't like us much . We 've just seen thousands of ... The feeling 's mutual . The government won 't tell us anything about it . I believe a little paranoia is warranted and I believe that the majority of the American public agrees with me . Well , fortunately , the American public has been know to disagree . The Secretary of State is colored ? You mean black . I 'll take your word for it . The National Security Advisor , too . Boy , the world sure has changed since ' 51 . You should try to relax , son . You 're not going to get out of here any quicker by wearing a groove in the floor . Are you some kind of jailhouse philosopher ? Barracks philosopher , actually . Oh ... I was a combat pilot in Korea . Nice tattoo . Who 's Lily ? A girl I ud to know . Shawn Farrell , report to interview room one . I 'll see you . Medical exams for group F returnees have been delayed by one hour ... What 's your name again , sir ? Orson Bailey . I want to speak to someone in charge . I mean , why can 't I just make a call ? Uncle Tommy , hi . It 's good to see you . Look , what 's going on ? Nobody will tell us anything . We 'll let you know as soon as we find out . I still can 't believe it 's you . How do you think I feel ? Listen , do you know how long they 'rgoing to keep us , because I really want to go home . Shawn , do you remember anything ? Anything at all about what happened that night ? Nothing . Nothing . One minute I 'm sitting there with Kyle on the beach . The next it 's three years later and I 'm standing next to some mountain with a couple thousand strangers around me . Listen , Uncle Tommy , some people are saying that we were abducted by aliens . We can 't rule anything out yet . Well , can you give me anying ? How 's my mom ? How 's Danny ? Fine , they 're all fine . They miss you . Great . Hey , what about Kyle ? I mean , he mushave seen something the night that I disappeared . Did he tell you anything ? He hasn 't said a word . He 's okay , isn 't he ? Isn 't he ? Kyle 's in a coma , Shawn . What are you talking about ? What I 'm talking about is Kyle lying on a bed with a ventilator down his throat being fed through one tube and pissing out another . He 's been like that ever since the night you left . He was fine last time I saw him . We were having a couple of beers . Look , don 't you lie to me , Shawn . I 'm no Don 't u lie to me ! I 've been waiting three years to hear the truth from you , so please don 't lie to me . I just told you the truth . Is that what you 've been thinking this whole time ? That I gave Kyle something that messed him up and that I just took off ? Screw you , Uncle Tommy . I just told you everything I know . Goddamn it ! You look as bored as I feel . I wish there were windows in this place . I 'd like to see the stars , wouldn 't you ? Do I look that bad ? No , it 's just you remind me of someone I used to know . How long you 've been gone ? Since ' 51 . It wouldn 't be me , then . '93 . I 'm Richard . Lily . My friend , her name was Lily , too . Lily Bonham . That 's my grandmother 's name . Lily Bonham from Saint Louis ? You knew my grandmother . Is she still alive ? I 'm sorry . She died before I was born . Are you all right ? Lily 's dead and I 'm sitting here with her granddaughter . It doesn 't make any sense . No goddamn sense at all . I know how you feel . I keep thinking I 'm going to wake up from this dream and tell my husband all about it . You have ... you have a family ? Yeah . Brian and I and our daughter , Heidi . She was six months when I ... So , what was she like , my grandmother ? Oh ... Everyone says I look a lot like her . They were right . I 'm sorry , that 's not possible right now . Th is ridiculous . You have no right hold us here like this . We haven 't done anything wrong . I 'm sorry . This is for you . Well , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lawsuit by the ACLU on behalf of the families . We don 't have a legal right to hold them . Okay , but some of these people have no place to go , no familieleft . The word is , gypt and China are refusing to repatriate its citizens . India 's on the fence . Oh , wait a minute . We 're not kicking anybody out . Whoever wants to stay can stay . As far as American citizens , whoever leaves will get whatever assistance is required to get their life back on track : Medicare , unemployment , rent vouchers , vocational training . Vocational training ? We need to isolate these people . They 're not virus samples , they 're human beings . The order 's been given . We 're letting them go . I wouldn 't book your vacations just ye Each Regional Homeland Security Office will be responsible for the returnees who settle in their region . So , we 'll be monitoring 79 people , plus another 135 have chosen to remain in quarantine for the time being . Each of our returnees will check in once a week . Any difficulties faced by the rurnees in our district will be handled by this office . nally , we 'll continue with our ongoing investigation . We 'll all sleep better once we know what the hell 's going on . Thank you . You look so lonely standing there without an ID number . I 'm supposed to be 82 years old . There 's no one here waiting for me . So what are you going to do now that you 're out ? Head back to the old neighborhood , I suppose . What about you ? No , wait , let me guess . Take your daughter to Woodland Park . We used to love that place . Of course , Heidi was barely crawling then and now she 's 12 . Uh ... You 've been a good friend . They told me there 'd be a bus to the city . Yes , sir . Right over there . Thanks . Hey , Mom ! Danny ! Shawn ! Oh , my God . Hey , buddy . Oh ... Brian ! Brian ! Sorry , I ... How you doing ? Good . Let 's ... Let 's go . Yeah , let 's get out of her Thank you . Can I help you ? Heid Yeah ? Heidi , it 's Mommy . Who ? Heidi ... It 's , uh , it 's okay , sweetie . I got it . Brian . Lily . Look at you . You han 't aged a day . Why didn 't you come pick me up ? Didn 't ... Didn 't they contact you ? Yeah . You have to try to undersnd , Lil . I didn 't think I was ever gonna see you again . I 'm married , Lily . Carol has been a really good mother to Heidi and ... we have a son now , too , a little boy . I 'm sorry . Lil , I 'm ... Lily . Elizabeth ? Orson ? Where have you been ? I 've been waiting for you . I know . Where 's the car ? We 're going to be late for dinner . I 'm sorry , hon . Things got a little out of control . But it won 't happen again . Hi , Mom . Sweetie . Hey , Shawn . Oh , y , George . Hey , guys . Good to see you . Hi . Yeah , sorry your buddies couldn 't show . I guess most of them are away at college . They 're just jealous I get to enjoy two more years of high school . High school 's not that bad . Hey , Shawn . Remember me ? Nikki ? No . Last time I saw you , you were just a little kid . Now look at you . Lucky me , huh ? Yeah , guess so . What the hell are you looking at ? I used to live here . Yeah ? Well , I live here now . Get the hell out of here . Why did you bring me here ? I thought I 'd put a human face on the returnees for you . Remind you they 're people , not viruses . Tom . You going to introduce me to your new friend ? Uh , Linda , this is , uh , this is my partner . My work partner . Diana Skouris . Diana , this is my wife , Linda . Hi . Nice to meet you . We 're separated . Oh . Call me . We need to talk . Well , that was awkward . Really ? Yeah . I hadn 't noticed . Give me a second . Hey , how you doing ? You look thirsty . Thank you . I-I just wanted you to know I 'm ... I really am glad you 're back . Whatever , Uncle Tom . Geez . Neck 's broken . Reflection must have confused him , huh ? Yeah . Why don 't you come back inside ? You 're missing your own party . I know . It 's just weird being in there ... I guess he was just stunned . Yeah . Yeah , I guess so . I 'll see you in there . lovely people and that , thain Quarantine , right ? Besides , there 's nothing we can handle , right , Maia ? That would be nice . Well , we should get going . It 's a bit of a drive to Everett . Yeah , terrific . Good luck , Maia . You 'll see me again . Yeah , next week . Sooner than that . And when we bought the building , your mother said , " What ? That old thing ? " Can I get you anything ? Uh ... water , that 'd be fine . Mary could you get Mr. Bailey some water ? Just down here . You know , I can 't get over it . You look exactly the same as the last time I saw you . And you were what , 1 Your father asked me to show you the ropes . Looks like I succeeded . Please , have a seat . Thank you . So what can I do for you , Mr. Bailey ? My old corner office , for starters . Thank you ... A secretary , some business cards . I should be able to start seeing clients within a week or so . You 're looking for a job ? This is still Kensington Bailey , isn 't it ? I 'm embarrassed . Uh ... Times are tight . I just had to lay off three of my actuaries . I don 't have any openings right now , Mr. Bailey . Openings ? I 'm a partner here . Mr. Bailey , your interest in this company was bought out when you were declared dead . Well , your wifet dead . accepted the settlement . It is all legal . Don 't be too sure of that . What happened to me ... there is no precedent . You are right about that , but it might be years until precedent is established . Until that happens , all of you ... returnees are going to have to get in line and plead your case in front of a judge . I mean , do you have the kind of resources to ... ? Have you seen the place my wife is in ? I have to get her out of there . I don 't think we should discuss is any further . I need money . Now . The living room ... and there 's the kitchen . Do you want to see your room ? Okay . I think it 's really nice . It 's the one over here . Come here . We just had it redone . It 's a very nice room . I got you a few outfits to start . Tomorrow we 'll go shopping . You can pick out some more yourself . Okay . Maia . Honey . We have a rule . No shoes on the furniture . I don 't want them to get wet . Wet ? Why would they get wet ? Why don 't you get cleaned up ? We 're going to eat soon . * Bye , bye , baby * * Don 't be long * * I worry about you * * While you 're gone * * Bye , bye , baby * * Don 't be long * * I worry about you * * While you 're gone * * I think of you in my dreams * * You never know just what you mean to me * * To me * * Bye , bye , baby * * Don 't be long * * I worry about you * * While you 're gone * * Bye , bye , baby * * Don 't be long * * I worry about you * * While you 're gone * * I think of you night and day * * I never know just what u meant to say * * To say * Anita ? ! Adam , it 's Orson . Let me in . I want to talk . I know you can hear me . Let me in ! You want me to wake the whole neighborhood ? Tom ? What are you doing here ? Your phone is off . Ryland wants us to come in . What 's up ? There 's been a murder . The police are holding one of the 4400 . That 's him . That 's Orson Bailey . Bailey- - some kind of businessman , right ? Right . Life insurance ? Yeah . Disappeared in the ' 70s . '79 , declared dead in ' 86 . Seate police are holding him in connection with a homicide in Madison Park last night . Do they know he 's one of the 4400 ? Bailey told them . That why ty called us . Well , I thought the returnees were told not to discuss their status . Well , weounsel them to avoid it if they possibly can , but , you know , we were talking job interviews and housing applications . There 's not really a protocol for being questioned about a murder . You said holding , not charging . That 's right . There are some conflicting reports about what actually went on at the crime scene . We 'll check it out . Quietly . I don 't want to be dodging microphones at the 6 : 00 news . Quietly it is . Diana ? Hi , this is Linda . I can 't take your call right now , but please leave me a message and I 'll call you back . Linda , it 's me again . You said we needed to talk , so pick up the phone . Linda , come on . All right , call me . Everything all right ? Yeah , same old same old . Call me , don 't call me . I wish she 'd make up her mind . You know , I had a boyfriend once . Every time he 'd tell ... A boyfriend ? Well , don 't look so surprised . Yeah , anyway , the thing about this guy that used to drive . You can stop . I barely got started . All I 'm ying is , yodon 't have to try to make me feel better . Well , it was more of an attempt at bonding via a shared similar experience . Can you open the door ? How long did you go out with this guy ? Nine months . Nine months ? Mm-hmm . So , you 're equating your nine months of dating with my 19 years of marriage ? Yeah , you 're right . Okay , forget it . You want me to drive ? What for ? I don 't know . So you can brood ? Just get in . Look who floated in on a ball of light . Remember me , Farrell ? Rossi Hi Well , it looks like the steroids finally kicked in . Funny man . Funny . Always did appreciate your sense of humor . Like that time you sold me those concert tickets right before you disappeared . To the Foo Fighters ? How was the show ? I wouldn 't know ; the cops were waiting for me when I showed up . Tickets were stolen , man . You got me arrested . You got arrested for stolen tickets ? Yeah , I had five tabs of X on me . I had to pee into a cup once a week for two years because of you ! Stop it ! Hey , hey ! Come on ! Get off of him . This is between me and your brother . Yeah ? Well , I 'm making it between you a me . See you around , freak . Oh , by the way , how 'd you like the new paint job on your ride ? You okay ? I 'm fine . The security cameras caught everything . The guy definitely had a bug up his ass . Except , as far as we can tell , he never went inside . Kensington fell into all that glass and impaled himself . You 've been through all the footage ? Every scrap . Bailey never made it past the gate . Wait . Hold on a second . Did you see that ? That 's glass . Yeah . Something blew out the windows , but from the inside . Yeah , we 're still trying to figure that one out . There was no seismic activity . No evidence of a bomb or a gas leak . And Bailey 's not talking ? We 've sent half a dozen guys in there , but he hasn 't given us anything . Look , I 've been over and over this with you people . We 're not the police . We 're Homeland Security . Well , tell the bozos out there that I had nothing to do with what happened to Adam . Let 's just go over your d again . You went to see Adam Kensington about a job , and even though your name is still on the company letterhead , he brushed you off . I know how that 'd make me feel . I admit it , I was angry . I went to Adam 's house to , uh ... I don 't know why I went , but I didn 't kill him . Let me read you an e-mail Kensington sent his attorney after your visit . It 's not imptant . Just a sec . " Bailey is making desperate claims " regarding his financial stake in the company . " He actually threatened to sue . " I don 't think he realizes " that there are probably going to be " hundreds of lawsuits involving the 4400 . " It 'll take years . " The poor bastard , he really is a rather ... pathetic case . " I am not a lawyer , but I 'm not an idiot either . You 've had me here for 12 hours . Now , either you charge me with something . ... or let me go . So , we 're just going to let him walk , after what happened in there ? Yeah , looks like it . But for futureeference , if I ever want to play good cop / bad cop , I 'll let you kwow . Which one do I get to be ? This isn 't a joke . There 's a time to lean on a guy , and that wasn 't it . You shut him down . Look , I 'm sorry . But Bailey admitted he was angry with Kensington . He was at his house . I didn 't say it was over , did I ? Do you think they ever thought about me ? Oh , sweetie ! They were your parents . I am sure that they thought about you every day . Thanks for bringing me here . This place used to be so nice . Now thkids leave their garbage everywhere . Ah , it really is a shame . You don 't have to worry . Crown Ridge is nice . Crown Ridge Cemetery ? Yes . That 's where you 'll be . Be ... ? Be what ? Buried . Kensington 's a popular guy around here today . The whole staff 's been through to look at the postmortem . Yeah , why 's that ? Well , he might have been a boring old suit when he was alive , but in death ... he 's a rock star . God , look at that ! Those were his parietal bones ? We 've seen beating deaths in here as bad as you can imagine . Even the guy that jumped off the Space edle and had to be brought to us in a garbage bag . But I have never seen a skull in this kind of shape before . Thousands of tiny little bone fragments ... Kensington was impaled . Are you saying that 's not how he died ? Oh , that would have killed him , but he was already dead from a shattered skull . Hello ? Hello . Is , uh ... Lily there ? Who ? Is this Heidi ? Yes . I 'm Richard Tyler . A friend of your mother 's . My mother 's name is Carol . Are you sure you have the right number ? This is the Moore residence , isn 't it ? Yeah , buthere 's no one named Lily here . Sorry . Well , I 'm afraid I can 't give you any medicine for the nausea . Why not ? Because it wouldn 't work . You 're not sick , Lily . You 're pregnant . That 's impossible . The-the quarantine doctors would have told me . You said they gave you a full screening seven weeks ago . If you just conceived , it wouldn 't have shown up in their tests . Conceived ... ? ! en ? I assume it happened right before you disappeared . But there 's no mistake . You 're definitely pregnant . Now , there 's nothing to worry about . I would like to see you again next week , and you can get used to the information . Shawn ! Hey . How you doing ? Mm ... good . What 's up ? You get your car fixed ? It 's going to be in the shop for about a week . Yeah . You know , Danny and I are going to a party tonight at Eddie Tobin 's house . You should come . I don 't think so . Why not ? Um , well , they 're going to be listening to music I 've never listened to , talking about movies I 've never seen . School is bad enough . Partying with a bunch of runts from ... Is that how you saw me , a runt ? You were 14 , Nikki . And now ? I 'm late for class . Where 's my wife ? My wife , where is she ? Mr. Bailey , you have our deepest condolences . What ? We called your hotel room , there was no answer . Elizabeth ? It was a pulmonary embolism , about 1 : 00 this morning . We tried to revive her . No ! A pulmonary embolism ... Please , Mr. Bailey . Calm down . Don 't tell me e 's dead . Mr. Bailey , just calm down . She 's all I have ! Let go of me ! No ! No ! Get away from me ! So the red dots mark the spots where the American members of the 4400 originally lived . You mean the returnees . Not according to the press . It 's the 4400 . You know , you have to admit , it 's a bit strange , a nice round number like that . ff I wonder if it has any significance . So you 're saying that if 3,781 people had suddenly showed up that night , it wouldn 't have been as strange ? I 'd say ... slightly less strange . This , however , is downright weird . Here 's where the 4400 are right now , two weeks after their release . 65 % are still in Seattle . They 're just not going home . And none of them can come up with a good reason as to why . You think it means something ? In the CDC , we 'd call this a statistically significant disease cluster . Yeah , well , in the FBI , we 'd call it a freaky coincidence . Well , I don 't believe in coincidences . Disease clusters . I lieve in those . What do you mean , you 're pregnant ? I just found o a few days ago . I don 't understand . When you were disappeared , I 'd been in New York for weeks studying for the bar . I can 't explain it . I haven 't been with anyone else . So what are we talking , immaculate conception ? I don 't know what we 're talking about . I wish I did . You know , when you disappeared ... I would have given anything in the world to talk to you again . I had whole conversations with you in my head . I missed you so much , Lily . But we can 't do this . I have another family now . And I 'm sorry , I know that 's not fair you , but ... Brian , I 'm still part of your life , whether you want me to be or not . Lily , you haven 't been a part of my life for 11 years . I want to see Heidi . I 'm sorry , that 's impossible . She 's my daughter . She doesn 't know that . She thinks that Carol is her mother . You never told her about me ? She was a baby when you left . Hell , we were babies when you left . You can 't stop me from seeing her . I already have . What is that ? It 's a temporary restraining order . Brian , I haven 't done anything wrong . Lily , I 'm a lawyer . I know how to work the system . Now , I don 't want to u this , but I will if you force me to . My first priority has to be to protect my family . I am your family . I wish you were , but you 're not . Not anymore . I 'm sorry , Lil , I 'm asking you , please , stay away from Heidi . And from me . I 'm sorry , Lil . At first I thought it was an earthquake . Everything was shaking , falling off the walls . But then- - I can 't believe I 'm going to say this- - things started to fly around the room . Paper , chairs . What do you mean , fly ? I mean fly , like it was a tornado . Except there was no wind . Everybody was screaming , Mr. Bailey was shouting . My head felt like it was going to burst . And then suddenly it was over . What about Bailey ? Oh , he looked scared . Like the rest of us . That 's when he ran away . The staff ... everyone 's saying he 's one of these people , the 4400 . Is that true ? Listen to me very carefully . You are not going to talk about this to the press or anyone else , and the same goes for your staff . If I pick up a paper and see a word of this or I see it reported on the news , I 'm going to take an interest in this place . Things flying around the room . I know , but we got a half dozen witnesses all saying the same thing . Yeah , flying . I 've got to do a briefing for Home Sec DC in the morning and I 'm going to tell them what ? Well , I 'd go with " the incident is under investigation . " Bailey checked out of his hotel after he left the nursing home . He could be on the run , we 're not sure . Find him . You bought us some time , but this story 's going to leak and I want Bailey in our hands before it does . So is calculus everything you remember it to be ? Uh , you heard about Williamson and Ms. Sinclair , right ? No . No ? Oh , they found them in the janitor 's closet . What is that ? Making out , not dead . What ? Everybody in school 's been talking about it . Yo , freak . You still hiding behind your little brother ? You know what , Brad ? You need to shut it down . You want to shut me down ? You know , the only thing I 'm shutting down is you , bitch . You 're really starting to piss me off now . Come on . Bring it . Shut me down . Let him go . Shawn ! What did you do to him ? I dHey , keep your voice down , here anyshe 'll hear you . It 's bad enough she tells us we 're going to be buried at Crown Ridge Cemetery , but the next day we get a brochure from the place in the mail ? It a coincidence . Look , she 's not what we expected , so let 's just talk to her . Yeah . I ... Maia ... It 's okay . I knew I wasn 't going to be here very long . Come on . Come on , let 's go . Give me the ball . Your shot , space boy . What is your problem , Danny ? What 's my problem ? Yeah , what 's your problem ? at 'd you do to Brad ? Come on , Danny . Not you , too . Come o The way he went down , that 's not normal . You know it , I know it , everybody saw it . What are you saying ? You tell me . I didn 't do anything to him , all right , Danny ? Not a thing . And is this all that 's left when you 're done ? I mean , poor Mrs. Bailey . It 's a box of trinkets . They 're not trinkets , they 're memories . The kind you leave behind , you know , for your family and friends . I should get to work on that . I 'm not going there . Well , believe it or not , some of us arhappier alone . No one 's happier alone . If they think that , they 're kidding themselves . I thought you weren 't going there . You see this ? This looks promising . " Wyler Summer Cabin . " Wyler was Elizabeth 's maiden name . Orson 's panicking , he needs a place to run . Well , there 's no address . We 'll have to find one . It 's better this way . For everyone . Everyone ? Or just you ? Maia , honey , you know this isn 't about you . You are a wonderful girl . It 's just , Kenneth and I , we just made a mistake . We 're t ready to be parents yet . It 's okay . No , it 's not . But , sweetie , those things you say , they can scare people if you 're not careful . Do you understand ? Good . For you . Go ahead , take it . Wh is it ? A CD I burned . Think of it as a crash course in all things new and cool . The Darkness , Handsome Boy , Modeling School , Killing Joke . All the bands you never heard of . Thank yo But , Nikki , I could listen to all the music and watch all the shows , but it wouldn 't matter 'cause they 're still going to look at meike I 'm differt . At least you 'll be listening to some good music . I don 't understand . See , because everybody has been looking at me like I 'm somkind of monster since the fight . But you ... aren 't you afraid to be seenith me No . What do I care what those creeps think ? If you like the CD , I 'll burn you another one . Sounds great . All right . Okay . Okay . See you . I 'll talk to you later . Okay . Hello ? Okay , bring up the satellite shots . So we 're looking for a small house with a north-facing exposure somewhere within the vicinity of Appleton Lake . If it 's still standing . No structures in grids one , two , three and nine . Four and seven each have one , but they 're the wrong shape . Let 's eliminate all those . That leaves us with five , six and eight . That 's too small . at 's the wrong orientation . That 's too small , that 's too big . Nothing but trees in eight . It 's not there anymore . Hang on a second . Get in a little tighter on this . Well ... it looks like it could be a house . No , this was taken 50 years ago . These trees would be huge by now . Enlarge again . Bingo . Thers your house . Bingo . Appleton 's what , aut 70 miles ? Yeah . Look , when we get up there , I 'll handle Bailey . All right . Are we leaning on him ? No leaning . No problem . Excuse me . You Tom Baldwin ? Yeah , who are you ? You 've been served . Sorry , man . You 're getting sued ? Linda 's filed for divorce . Lily . Richard ! Richard . Oh . I don 't understand . I ... I thought you went home . I did , but there was nothing there for me . But , uh ... How did you find me here ? Woodland Park , right ? This is where you used to bring Heidi . Richard , was terrible . Brian 's remarried . Heidi doesn 't know anything ... Hello , Maia . Hello . Oh ... I like it out here . It 's much better than my stuffy office . But you didn 't bring me out here to talk about the weather . You 're a very smart little girl . Thank you . The thing is ... that the Griffins didn 't really give a reason why they brought you back . Maybe they didn 't have a reason . Could be . Were they mean to you ? No . Were you mean to them ? No . Why do you think you 're back here ? I don 't think they like kids mh . Why do you say that ? They brought me back and I 'm a kid . You don 't really want to tell me the reason , do you ? That 's okay . Maybe you 'll change your mind one day . Maybe . Hi , this is Linda . I can 't take your call right now , but please leave me a message and I 'll call you back . What , she 's still not answering ? Nope . Can I ask you a question ? No . Well , I 'm going to ask you anyway . So your son , how long has he been in a coma ? Three years . That 's a long time . You have no idea . Maybe you and your wife , you can work things out ? You know , one day Kyle 's going to wake up and I 'll have to tell him his whole family 's fallen apart . I go to that hospital every day and I tell myself that makes me a good father . Oh , you are a good father . Kyle 's lucky to have a dad like you . Not everyone does . You can trust me , ' cause I know . A baby ? You sure ? I had the doctors do the test three times . 'Cause the thing is that Brian was out of town when I disappeared and I haven 't been with anyone since I 've been back . I don 't understand it . How-how could you be ... ? I don 't know . I 'm sorry to be dumping this on you . It doesn 't ... It 's not really fair . It 's okay . I want to help . There 's some sort of connection between us , isn 't there ? I feel it . I can feel it , too . That 's why I came back . But it 's more complicated than that . Your grandmother and I , we weren 't just friends , it was ... it was more than that . We were going to start a family . I think part of me already knew that . The way you talk about her . The look in your eye . Here it is , I thought I was playing it so safe . It must have been difficult , the two of you , a white woman and a black man in the ' 50s . Mmm . Black . Back then I was Negro , colored or worse . We didn 'care . We figured after the war , we 'd take off to some big city like Chicago or New York or Paris . But you never made it home . No . I never did . I 'm glad you found me . Me , too . * Bye , bye , baby * * Don 't be long * * I worry about you * * When you 're gone * * Bye , bye , baby * * Don 't be long * * I worry about you ... * Mr. Bailey , it 's Tom Baldwin , Homeland Security . We met at the police station , remember ? Mr. Bailey , we 're here to help but you 've got to talk to us . Go away . I 'm afraid we can 't do that . I just want to be left alone . I don 't want to hurt anyone . That 's good because we don 't want anyone else hurt . If you leave , I promise no one will ever see me again . I 'll just stay here ... Listen to me away from everyone . We both know that 's not going to work , Mr. Bailey . Now please , open the door . We can figure this out together . I 'm on your side . No , you 're not . No one is . My nephew , he 's one of the 4400 . Just like you . I 've seen how hard it is for him . I know it 's even harder for you . You don 't know anything . My wife , she was everything to me . Believe me , I 'm sorry for your loss . I don 't want any pity out of you . Go away ! I just want to be left alone . We can 't do that . I said ... get away from me . Stay away , please . Tom . Your nose . Hold on ... I can 't control it . I can 't control it . Whatever it is you 're doing , Mr. Bailey , stop it . I can 't control it . Stop it now ! You all right ? Yeah . I 'll call for an ambulance . Okay . We 're going to get you some help , Mr. Bailey . Just don 't die on me . Well , he 's alive . But it doesn 't look like he 's going to be talking to us anytimsoon . As far as the general public 's concerned , we 're going to deny it ever happened . Yeah , but we know better . The question is , will it happen again ? So what do you suggest we do Round them all up and put them back in quarantine ? You saw what Bailey could do . I mean , you felt it ... same as me . Who knows what the rest of them are capable of . I sure as hell don 't . But then again , it 's not my job to find out . It 's yours . Aren 't you glad you wanted back in ? I never thanked you for saving my life . I never shot anyone before . But seeing him lying there like that ... You going to be okay ? Yeah , I 'll get there . You know , I meant what I said to Ryland back there . If Orson can do those things , who knows where all this is going ? So far we 've got one case and maybe that 's all we 'll ever have . You ever noticed anything unusual with Shawn ? Because I just need to know if you had , you 'd tell me . There 's nothing to tell . Wha ... ? Yeah , look at this guy . There 's like three other sites just like this , but this one 's got a lot more stuff than the other ones . What are you guys doing ? Research . It 's just ... You know , the web , there 's a site for everything . " The Forty-Four Hundred Menace " ? I know this guy . I was in quarantine with him . They 're saying he killed someone just by thinking about it . So that makes me some kind of freak ? No . No , we were just ... I want to know how you took Brad down so fast . Come on , he did someing to him , you saw it . Danny , you have no idea what you 're talking about . Neither do you . Shawn . What ? You were thinking the same thing .

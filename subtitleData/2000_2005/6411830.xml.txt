 Previously on Farscape : Pilot : I am as concerned about Zhaan 's welfare as you , Commander . I simply thought you 'd like to see this before it went away . Crichton : Wormhole . Prepare to launch my module . There 's a ship approaching . What the hell ? Ruptures everywhere ! Moya is frelled ! Alien penetration of our vessel ! I am Pathfinder Neeyala . This region of space ... I cannot function under the bombardments . We have ricocheted into the distorted region that divides a wormhole from normal space time . How do we get the ships apart ? Is your Phaztillon Generator the key ? Yes . Rygel , what did you do ? ! You opened it ! What 's your name ? Joolushka Tunai Fenta Hovalis . How long have I been in this chamber ? 22 cycles . ( piercing scream ) I need empirical information about our position in the wormhole . Would you help ? Wormhole . Normal space . What are we doing here ? It 's only collecting images . I think wormholes blind him . The creature you have seen exists exclusively inside wormholes . Crichton : It 's amazing the number of species picked up by Neeyala 's gizmo . It 's possible to separate both ships , but only one will survive . We have to pick which one . I do not enjoy sending you to your death . These creatures , I will distract them . They must not know your true mission . Frell ! We will abandon Moya . Pilot , I wish you were going with us . ( hissing ) ( gasps ) ( hissing ) ( grunts ) And now on Farscape ... ( hissing ) Winona , don 't fail me now . ( pants ) ( grunting ) Crap . I 'm telling you , Aeryn , it was from Earth . A television transmission . What , you mean , like that Yoda from Dagobah ? No , no , no , no . Three Stooges . ( whoob whoob whoob whoob ) Well , whatever was in there , it 's not any use to us now . Do you know what this means ? - No , I don 't . It means that some part of this wormhole is 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 light years at most away from Earth . It 's doable . I could get home . Amidst our misfortune , I 'm pleased for you , John . Yes . I know . Selfish . ( rumbling ) ( clears throat ) Forget it . Where is Neeyala 's injured crew member ? What are you talking about ? Well , this is their blood . No , serpent blood . No , no , this is Neeyala 's species blood , John . Zhaan , there was no one here . What about that crew member who died ? Lost a limb during Starburst . Could the serpent have done that ? Well possibly , but why would they lie ? Yo , both of you . Even if Mr. Wiggles did chew on that guy , there was no one here . Their Phaztillon Generator . What does it do ? It alters the phase physicality of an object . Conceivably . We wouldn 't be able to see it . Invisible . I grow weak , Neeyala . They must continue to believe that their Leviathan deteriorates faster than it is . Even the remotest hope will cause them to rally to her . ( rapid vibrating sounds ) Shut down their thermal condensers . Losing ability to regulate temperature should convince them to abandon ship . ( computer bleeping ) I will do what needs to be done , including destroying them , if I must . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . ( steam rising ) There 's no way to tell if this is sabotage . Rygel : Doesn 't matter anymore if it is . Moya 's frelled and our only option is to go on Neeyala 's ship . And what if they are screwing us ? ( rumbling ) Especially if they 've screwed us . Means they have the upper claw . Nah , I 'm with D 'Argo on this . Ooh . I think we need to know the truth . I do not trust Crichton 's judgment . Agreed . He claims to have seen Earth again , and I 'm sure he 's still talking to Scorpius . D 'Argo : Mmm . We all know where Rygel 's loyalties lie . Sadly , Chiana 's , too . ( rumbling ) All right . Then whether they agree or not , we must stick to plan . First thing we do , everybody acts normal . Don 't tip them off . Surprise maybe our only ally . If Neeyala 's people aren 't sabotaging Moya , we 'll go with them . If they are , we defeat them . I 'll repair some of the nexus points ... Stark : ... so they 're isolated from Moya 's main systems . That way if they fry again ... - ... we 'll know it 's them . Do you actually believe they 're using their generator to turn themselves invisible ? It would explain the sequence of decompressions . It 's geographically consistent with someone running from place to place . Which leads us to the blood in Pilot 's Den . The cavern beneath must be searched . Can we rely on you , Rygel ? ( groans ) Can we rely on Rygel ? All right , but not for you . He has been on Moya the longest . For Moya . Keep Comms on restricted frequency . Switch Comms to Deka . Neeyala ? Neeyala . Neeyala is mine . First thing I want ... ( choking ) : to get from them ... is a head count . What is this ? She sheds . ( muffled protests ) ( hydraulic hatch opening ) ( sighs ) What are you doing ? - What are you doing ? Well , now that we 've both asked . I made 17 loops through the wormhole , fried the organic bits on my module . If we stick with Moya , she makes less than one . And I 'm just looking for ... anything . Now , what the hell are you doing ? Formulating ideas . Formulating ideas ? Well here 's an idea . Since we know nothing about this craft , how ' bout you stop pushing buttons ? ( ship humming ) All right , two for two . You 're not still feeling a little suicidal are you ? Not in the least . Ah , this looks interesting . ( screeching sounds ) Now , what do you suppose it does ? So far , scare the crap out of me . This ship feels somehow familiar to me . Yeah , you know we have a crisis going on out there ? I said I was formulating ideas . I heard you . ( bleeping and humming ) Being on Moya ... a fugitive ... it 's changed me . Well , if you 're not feeling suicidal , now 's a bad time for a midlife crisis . Chiana 's a young woman . She needs attention . D 'Argo , you were focused on your son . It 's completely understandable . Still , I neglected her . Do you know what troubles me the most ? I did my best . I did the best I could and it wasn 't enough . I still lost them both . My grandmother used to say that life is a great wheel . Sometimes it grinds you down in the mud and other times , it lifts you up into the light . Are we strapped to this wheel ? That 's a given . Point is , is that most times , you get a second chance . Just gotta wait for the wheel . Rygel : Aeryn , I 'm nine tiers below Pilot 's Den . I 've , uh , found the alien girl . Well , half of her . Looks like a serpent 's bite to me . All right . Well open the gills on her head and carefully remove some of the needles . Huh ? What in hezmana for ? I like to know my enemy . Zhaan ? Zhaan ! ( grunting ) That woman was invisible when she was killed in Pilot 's Den . Their betrayal must be punished . Not like this , Zhaan . It won 't help Moya . ( rumbling ) I must control myself . It was a bad trade , Zhaan . Your health for mine . Don 't undervalue yourself . I 'm just a solider . ( sighs ) Don 't underestimate yourself . I 'm being realistic . Don 't be afraid to understand yourself . We 're not as different as you assume . Violent past , no faith in the future . And then a transformative experience aboard this very ship . My time grows short . And yours stretches before you . Use it wisely . Jool ( laughing ) : A living ship . I 've never heard of such a beast . Which obviously means it can 't exist . Oh , you 've so figured me out . Not trying to . Be quiet please . The gag remains an option . Is it true what the animal said ? That you 're all prisoners ? At some time or other , yes . ( chuckles ) : Great . Just great . I take a multi-civilization tour for my birthday and barely make it through the first stop . I lose my deposit . My cousins get murdered . I 've been frozen for 22 cycles . I 've been captured by degenerate aliens . Attacked by a huge serpent 's ... Dead ! All of us , dead ! My love dead . My dreams dead . You dead . Me dead . You dead , me dead , you dead , me dead , you dead , me dead . Your list is short , and unworthy of entree to this ship of horror . Tortured by demons you could never know , mocked by love that will never be . ( grunts ) ( screams ) Oh , you want to cry , young creature ? I will show you something that will make you cry forever . ( gasping and screams ) ( screaming continues ) ( crying ) ( static sounds ) ( panting ) ( whimpering ) It 's me . ( panting ) : Uh , Tier Five , hamman level . A circuit blew but I had it off-line . Someone was here . Invisible . Get ready . The privilege of working with technology is guaranteed by our families . Should we fail to return this ship , they will all be executed . Why didn 't you just lie and tell us both ships could survive separation ? We would have happily remained here and perished with Moya . I did not wish to see you die . But I incorrectly assumed that given the choice , you would take the rational option . So , just to be sure , you helped things along ? You cripple a living ship and we jump at the chance to escape with you . I trusted you . Your feelings for Moya and Pilot are matched by those for our families . Allow personal passions to cancel each other out . What 's left ? Wormhole technology . Yes . Garnered at great cost , with potential beyond measure . Would you compare that with the lives of a ship and pilot which I assure you are doomed anyway ? Moya lives , Neeyala . You misjudge her will , and ours . Will ... is a poor substitute for beersian alloy when crushed by astronomical tidal forces . That 's still no excuse for sabotaging Moya . Stop Kreetago . He carries no communications device . That would give him away . He will continue his mission until your ship is incapacitated . Aeryn : Then we shall find a way to stop him . ( footsteps ) D 'Argo : DRDs . Find this frelling bastard . Very krell , D 'Argo . How did you think of it ? Watch for disruption in the beams . D 'Argo : His needles ! ( Chiana screaming ) Chiana : My leg ! D 'Argo , I 'm hit ! Tourniquet . It 'll stop the poison . With what ? ( grunting ) ( screaming ) He 's out here somewhere . Where ? Don 't look . Listen . ( screaming ) D 'Argo : Zhaan , Chiana 's got one of their needles in her leg . Rygel , do you still have the spikes from the alien corpse ? Yes . Why ? Meet me in my lab now . If this young girl dies , I will come back for you , and I will most certainly lose any chance I have left of meeting my goddess . ( shrill electronic tone pulses ) Explain . The generator has reached optimization phase . And what does that mean ? Once activated , the power cell will engorge a final time . And when it releases , we 'll find out if our ships are destined to separate . Aeryn , you wanna hold off ? Neeyala : Impossible . Even now , the reactor shuts down permanently . Listen ! ( shrill tone persists ) My crew is dead . This is our one chance to avoid the certainty of joining them . Go ahead . Neeyala : Be aware , should our vessels disengage , the built-in timing favors yours being the one destroyed . How long do we have ? Hard to discern with the damage . Maybe an arn , not more . Ridiculous . We tried Starburst . Everybody heaved . D 'Argo : Neeyala has fixed it so that when we separate she enters the wormhole while Moya is ejected through the wall and into normal space . From hetch impossible to a dead stop . It 's sub-atomic dispersal . All perfect reasons to be on her ship , strapping in for the ride . Starburst could rotate Moya so it 's us who 'll go into the wormhole . Where she 'll get ripped apart from the stress . I 've flown there , remember ? We voted , Rygel . - I didn 't get to vote . I was your proxy . Pilot 's in a coma , Moya is half decompressed , nothing works . Fine ! I 'll kill half an arn . I want you to reconnect Pilot to Moya 's external senses . The Neural Cluster ? ! D 'Argo , we shredded those synapses . D 'Argo : It 'll take all three of us . Splice and hook , nothing permanent . I want to give Pilot a chance . He 's unconscious . Well do your part . He 'll be awake . What if we 're not done when the time comes ? Then we race to the other ship . We 've gotta seal all the chambers on the outer rim . Starburst is going to spin us like a top . One decompression , and we 're vapor . Once secure , I 'll overload Pilot with Moya 's adrenal secretions . I really blew this one , Aeryn . Not done yet . ( Jool screaming ) It didn 't disappear . That 's new . 'Cause the generator 's fully-on , right ? - Correct . We now share the serpent 's phase existence and will until separation . It just keeps getting better . Crichton : One-Adam-Twelve , guys . The critter 's part of our reality now . Be careful out there . I 'll try and chase it to the outer rim . You do anything to upset the balance that I have set into place ... Zip it , tea lady ! You had your shot . We 're taking ours . You can 't leave us tied up like this . What if that thing comes back ? Mmm , these are very similar to the quellian tibor 's mating spikes . Pliable root , tensile fiber stalk , metalline venom tip . Will she be all right ? Well , I believe so . But not if Rygel hadn 't secured these other needles for antibody serum . I heard the plan . I 'm ready to go . Uh , uh , uh ! The more your blood pumps , the more chance you 'll make a liar out of me , child . Oh ! Ever my protector . It 's not you who needs protecting . It 's the rest of the universe I fear for . When I was first incarcerated on this ship , wild and murderous , I could not conceive how I would survive . I heard a rumor that a Luxan warrior was a fellow prisoner . I actually prayed that the brute would succumb to Hyper-Rage and kill me . How ironic is that ? There is a planet out there that will heal you . The intent is noble . The result is in the hands of the gentle goddess . Too bad about Pilot . I liked him . He liked you , too . Hmm ? How do you know ? He told me . He did ? Mmm . Comms . What are you doing ? Deputizing you , debutante . See those lights ? They 're cycling faster . Hear that noise ? - Ow ! The pitch is rising . At some point , we 're out of time . I want you to make a judgment call . When you think it 's going to blow , you get us back here . What ? I mean , I don 't know how ... Look , Princess , I know that this ... trip to Kruegerland was not on you 're itinerary , but believe it or not , I know exactly how you feel . Don 't presume to know anything about me . You hold this ... steady . Be more afraid of what you 're aiming at . I 've never done anything like this before . - None of us have . You killed my cousin ! Not on purpose ! He was a corpsicle and your other cousin ... He didn 't last half a minute defrosted . Then why did I survive ? I don 't know . You 're not sick . Maybe they shanghaied you for body parts . You 're the freebie . Everything I have seen so far is despicable ! Welcome to the Federation Starship S.S. Buttcrack ! ( gasping for breath ) Decompression Tier Three ! Zhaan : It 's rolling ! Internal airtights are giving way . Zhaan , do not enter Pilot 's access corridor ! ( clattering ) Vent Tier Three and Four air bladders . Back pressure the hatches . Crichton : I 'm three , big man . You go four . Zhaan : We 're going to be cut off . Do something ! No , blocked . Outer hull rupture . Long way . Chiana 's okay . So I heard . ( relieved sigh ) Serpent ! ( screaming ) It 's a good call , Rygel on the gill darts . Anybody ever tell you how good you are around here ? Matter of fact , just recently . Whoa ! Go on , keep moving . I got a plan . Don 't tell me you have a plan . What 's wrong with them ? - They never work . Damn these doors ! They always work . - Not the way you detail them . Hey , look , I get results . You 're hung up on details . Your plans never work . This way . How did this ship get open ? - Aeryn , get in here . But we don 't know anything about it . - Aeryn , just get in here . Aeryn : This is wrong . D 'Argo rubbed the damn thing . Now get in . ( mechanical beeping ) ( loud buzzing ) Crichton , you idiot ! Aeryn , D 'Argo found a force field here somewhere . Just gotta find the button . " Idiot ? " Ha ! World class plan . Zhaan : Why hasn 't anyone vented Tier Four 's air bladders ? Zhaan , uh , sorry , we ran into a little problem here . The passageways beyond have opened to space . There 's no way I can get to Pilot . Your excuses have failed him again , John . That 's it ! All the outer chambers are sealed . How 'd you go , Heavy D ? The air bladders are completely vented , but we don 't have enough back pressure to reverse the damage done in Pilot 's quarters . If Pilot 's dead ... Yes . We 're out of here . Aeryn , it 's all you now . Link number four ... open to space . Only one more to go . Jool , how 's the timing ? I 'm not sure . Do better . Faster ... maybe . Approximately one third increase . Geometrically building . The alien says I 'm right . Aeryn : Third level in is compromised . Like the last two . I beseech your wisdom . Hatale . I entreat your spirit . Hatala . I petition your mercy . The gentle are stricken . The kind are helpless . The silent uncounted . I 'm approaching Pilot 's Den . Even as a Tenth Level Pa 'u , I am weary , and without resources . Oh , goddess of all things holy , hear my soul . This gentle ship is pledged to my care , and I am powerless . Though I am but a mote upon your winds , grant me one supplication . Ask anything in return . Just spare them their lives . The seal has held . The air is thin , but it is breathable . Yes ! ( soft exclamation ) Yatsa ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Aeryn : We 're gonna try this . I 'm gonna need Moya 's adrenal secretions pumping on my command . Just tell me when . So , we 're agreed ? One shot . Go ! - Go ! - Go ! Go . Go ! - Go ! You shouldn 't be up . These hands can wire ... wire a whole lot of neural cluster . ( grunt ) Get me there . Time ? Fractionally faster . John ? Yeah ? Why is this ship so important ? Still worried about your parents after 22 cycles ? Yes . That 's how we feel about Moya . She raised us . Bravo , bravo . Magnificent . Encore ! Encore , John . John Crichton was riveting in the role of cheerleader , rallying his comrades in the aid of the stricken ship he had earlier betrayed . That 's my Dad 's tux . Take it off . This is not mine . This is not my tux . - You can choose the venue , John , but I 'm going to make sure Yeah ! Macon . Georgia . Macon , Georgia , on the way to Lauderdale . - College spring break ... Hitchiking ... This is the truck stop . - To see the strippers in Fort Lauderdale . Hey , yo , yo , no ! You do not enter my reality . You do not talk to me in my reality . If I want you , I 'll call . Those are the rules . Unacceptable . And I suggest you sue for peace now . Your distractions are many , while I 'm totally dedicated to getting a measure of freedom . No more dumpsters , John . Tabled . What do you want ? You might fool them with your rah-rah , but I know the disappointment of letting Neeyala 's ship be destroyed . Yeah , well , you can 't have everything you want . I 'll figure out wormholes by myself . Green Chevy . I had one of those . It 's not too late to change the outcome . Oh , you know everything about me . Do you wanna make a point ? Excellent , excellent , yes . And with familiarity , we might develop a shorthand which will benefit us both . Try this . You would do ... well , anything to save your ship . Anything . Make a point . Why assume less of Neeyala ? Jool ? ! Jool ! ( groaning ) Adrenal secretions fully opened , Aeryn . Goddess speed . ( grunting ) Pilot ! Come on , Pilot , feel that nice , warm adrenaline flow everywhere ! ( moaning ) ( sluggishly ) : Officer Sun ? Hello . Hello . No . No ... Wake up ! Neeyala . Let 's work together on this . We 'll all survive . We 'll get you home . Family executed . Me to follow . Knowledge lost . No , thanks . We both defend that which we love . You shouldn 't've lied . You should not have been in our path . And I should have listened to Kreetago and destroyed you when I had the chance . I have failed my crew , and my ship . Now I will make it up to them . Don 't make me shoot you . I encharged hydrostatic vapor residue in atmospheric suspension . One spark and we 're nuclear ? Meager as it is , you do know more than any species we 're aware of . We can find a way . If my ship survives , even without me , a beacon will attract our flight command . If , by some unfathomable circumstance your vessel survives ... We share a joined hull . I have just infused our beacon into the Leviathan 's superstructure . We 're going to have ... another set of bad guys ... chasing us across the universe ? Unfortunately Commander , not you . I don 't think so . ( hissing ) ( hissing ) Hey Neeyala ! You think this is gonna get you what you want ? What I want , you cannot give . ( yelling ) Crichton : Jool , you nitwit ! ( screeching ) I have never before released my bristles to kill . Your forgiveness . ( screeching continues ) Melted tips ? ( screeching continues ) Hey , what 's the matter ? You can 't hear me ? ( sizzling ) That 's a hell of a scream . Thanks . Come on . We 're almost out of time . - Crichton , it 's Aeryn . Pilot 's just doing the calculations now . It won 't be long . We 're out of time , Aeryn ! Just a little bit more ? We are out of time ! Which ones ? Which ones ? Stop yelling at me ! The yelling starts in about two seconds ! Which ones ? These . I 'm pretty sure . You 're sure ? Be sure ! I 'm hurt ! She hit me in the head ! What ? Did you see the order ? This , this , this , this , this . Yes . - What the hell is that ? Diagnostical helix . The mathematical representation of quantum elasticity . Right , right , right , that 's good . Enough ! Enough ! Thank you ! - Order of nature . Hello ! Over there . ( indignant yell ) Guys , I got Zhaan here with me . Where are you ? On my way . We 're not quitting . D 'Argo ? Stark ? We 're never going to make it , John . We voted to stay together , no matter what . Even Rygel ? Pilot likes me . You know , I would care to say that anything that gets me out of here alive is what we should be doing . You are an ungrateful and selfish woman . Please remain silent from now on . Zhaan , none of this is going to matter if Pilot doesn 't ... I am ready . Pilot , hey ! Man , it 's good to see ya . How you doin ' ? No , no , answer that later . We got a serious situation here . What ... What do we gotta do ? Impulse data from each test of their generator was stored in Moya 's neural circuitry , allowing me to construct a statistical model ... Yeah , yeah , yeah , whatever . I trust you to do the math . Just tell me what we gotta do . I must initiate Starburst approximately seven microts after the generator is unleashed . Oh dear Chanu , please don 't let me die this way . Please . Who is that creature ? That 's ballast . Ignore it . How exact do we have to be ? Not as close as you think . - Aeryn . Ah , once we start spinning , Moya 's weight gives us an advantage with the gravitational pull of the wormhole . Then Neeyala 's vessel will be the one ejected directly into space . Pilot , you want to try a little manual point and shoot just in case you fade ? Yes , Commander . - Crichton , no . - Feel lucky ? No , no , no , no , no . I 've never flown a wormhole . I think it should be you ... Aeryn , it 's easy . The exits are clearly marked and you 're better with Moya . No , John . Zhaan ... I 've got this . - What 's going on ? Well just a guess , but somebody 's got to actually trigger the generator . Get back . Both of you get back . No ! Aeryn , Aeryn , do you see this disco ? I put it here , I 'm gonna take it away . Crichton , Aeryn , enough . You are both so good at gauging reality . Yet , in this instance ... Zhaan , there 's a planet out there . A long shot at best , John . The illness that is ravaging my body is frighteningly efficient . No ! So while I 'm still sound of mind and spirit , I choose this path for myself . Zhaan , you 're needed here . At one time , I believe I was . But then a family was born . You birthed it . We love you , Zhaan . Oh ! Decompression , decompression . Where to go , where to go , where to go ? Zhaan , it 'll be easy . I 'll start the generator . I 'll come across . If it is so easy , allow me . Zhaan , no . No , no . No more . If I am so needed , and so valued and so wise , then you will honor my words . You will obey me . ( agonized panting ) For the longest time , I feared physical demise , because my spiritual essence was suspect . But now , I know I 'm worthy . Now I know the transgressions have melted from my soul . Now I know I shall meet my goddess and be accepted to her bosom . Sensitive D 'Argo ... exuberant Chiana ... wise Rygel ... selfless Aeryn ... innocent Crichton . My children . My teachers . My loves . There is no guilt . There is no blame , only what is meant to be . Grow through your mistakes . And know that if patient , redemption will find you . Wait for the wheel . Thank you , John Crichton . ( moans very softly ) No . - No . ( agonized wailing ) Zhaan : Stark ... Stark ... Link with me , my beautiful . Guide me to the place of rest . Meld into my spirit , Stark , so that I may share my last moments with the man I love . Goodbye , you big , beautiful , blue bitch . No ! ( all wailing ) ( explosion ) Zhaan : Always together . Joined as one . Peace of mind , peace of spirit , peace of soul . Goodbye , my love . ( rumbling ) Crichton : Manual . Aeryn , you gotta fly this baby . ( screaming ) ( grunting ) ( grunting ) I appreciate your concern , Rygel . It 's just that you 've never paid this much attention to me before . ( chuckling ) I think maybe you haven 't noticed . I like you , Pilot . I like you a lot . And I know Zhaan did , too . Shame you didn 't get to say goodbye . When I was unconscious , in pain , she came to me . Inside my mind . I ... already miss her . Ow ! Oh ... wait for me . Not that way on Moya . You want to move faster , get better shoes . Or maybe get in better shape . Do you know how much these shoes cost , young whore ? For me ? Three sex acts . Probably double that for you . ( grunting ) You have some nerve to talk to me that way . One of my very ... very best friends has just gone . Right now , I am nothing but nerve . You want someone to like you ? Invest in a mirror . Honestly , Aeryn , you don 't have to hover over me . To be honest in return , Stark , I 'd expect you to be a bit more upset . Well , after fifteen thousand deaths , what 's fifteen thousand and one ? The woman you loved . Those I minister to in their final moments are usually resistant to the process . Not Zhaan . Imagine being so at peace , so certain what was next was better . She does not want us upset . She wants us to carry on in her spirit . Positive and hopeful . And you can do that ? Not always . I would appreciate you hovering , then . ( laughter ) Moe : You 're in a court not in Clancy 's Pool Room . Sit down . Curly : I 'm a victim of circumstance . Who you hitting ? Ow . Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk ... Ooh ! Why is it always the gentle ones that pay the price for everyone else 's ambition ? Hmm ? ( glass shattering )

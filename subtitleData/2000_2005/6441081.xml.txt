 In order to discover the truth The evening news doesn 't tell you How many things aren 't broadcast ? Who loses Who is obtaining it , and for whose sake ? Being pure is a beautiful and dangerous thing The world that surrounds us won 't show itself All it does is force a truth different from yesterday 's on us At the very least , I will try to change the feeling of the reality that is right in front of me Into something certain , surely Shin-lu ! No , don 't come any closer ! Someone is ordering me to fight you , Kai ! Someone is saying to ! Don 't bother us anymore ! You bastard , why are you here ? This has nothing to do with you ! Shin-lu ! Shin-lu ! Are you all right ? I ... Let 's go back , Shin-lu . You shouldn 't be in a place like Gald . Wait ! Hold off on taking her back to Ashurum . What ? Until you know the reason why Shin-lu is acting so strangely . Are you trying to say that the reason might be at Ashurum or something ? That is ... What are you saying we can learn by staying here ? Shen-long ! Kai Kudou ! A fairly big nuisance has gotten in the way , but how about we start getting back to the game ? Episode Nineteen As You Are Guided Come on , now ! It 's no fun if you just run ! What , we 're playing hide-and-go-seek now ? In that case , I 'll take that building out along with you ! Okay , that 's enough ! Sherry ? If you play around too much , Maxim will get mad at you again . What are you say ... We 've got a new mission . The mission 's been changed . The attacks ... have stopped . Where are Shen-long and Shin-lu ? ! Shin-lu ... Where am I ? That 's right ... Damn it ... I remember . That irritating guy and that irritating girl came here , to take Asuka ... Asuka ! If you 're looking for her , she went upstairs just now . She stayed by your side this whole time , up until just now . Why are you here ? Didn 't get away fast enough ? Yuuki ! Thank goodness , you 're awake now . Asuka . Here you go , a change of clothes . Hey , Yuuki ... What 's the matter ? Would it be all right for me to go to Maria 's place for a bit ? I promised her I would go . What ? ! What are you saying ? ! You 're not thinking that 's just like going to some neighbor 's house to hang out , are you ? ! Yuuki ... I don 't know what kind of promise you made , but cancel it ! Cancel it ! But ... but she saved us ! Yuuki , you haven 't even thanked her yet ! Why are you getting so angry ? I want to help Maria . After all , it was Maria that tended to your wounds , Yuuki ... Hmm . Are you feeling guilty , or is this just an act ? Thanks for that . Yuuki ! What ? You said that I hadn 't thanked her , so I did . Yuuki ... What the hell ... I guess I 've got no choice ... Hey , can you get old man Erimiya to meet up with me one more time ? It 's not like there 's a problem with her having an escort , right ? We would welcome it . You 'd better . And if anyone tries anything funny , I won 't waste any time in taking Asuka home . Well , that 's how it is , so go and get some things packed . Wait ! There 's something else ? Won 't it be bad if we 're not here when Kai comes back ? Kai ? I completely forgot about him . Well , it 'll probably be all right if we write him a letter or something . Asuka , write something like , " We 're going to go hang out at the guerillas ' base for a little while ! " What is it ? What ? Hurry up ! Kai ! Kai ! Kai ! I 've been waiting this whole time for you to come and visit , Kai . I even kept my promise ! I see . But I wasn 't lonely . And I was able to make a lot of friends . Thank goodness . Listen , Kai ... Hmm ? There 's something I want to say to you , Kai ... Raphael ! Whoa ! Wait a second ! Yay ! Wait up ! Let 's meet again ! Kai ! Thank you ! Raphael ... Telepaths , huh ? Telepaths ? Why are you bringing that up ? I read about them in a book . It 's said that our powers are similar , yet different , from the supernatural powers described in old documents . Or they might be the exact same thing . In that case , are there also psychics who can use telepathy ? It 's said that there are . Telepathy ... it is both an exceptional power , and at the same time , one that outrivals the most destructive of powers . The power to control the minds of men . Control ... Well , it isn 't like I 've actually met one , and while it may sound unreal , I don 't believe that they DON 'T exist . The shape of your evolution ... might be the power that you all acquire from here on . Psychics aren 't the end of human evolution . After all , they themselves will evolve in turn . Evolution ... Wait up ! No way ! Don 't get me wrong . It 's not like I trust you . Are you listening ? Just because Asuka 's taken kindly to you ... Yuuki ! This way . She 's not even listening . Wow ! Asuka , don 't go just mindlessly touching all the stuff over there ! So , where are we ? Are we supposed to be taking a break in a place like this ? Damn ... What is this , the silent treatment ? I 'm sorry . I got you hurt . So ... I 'm sorry . Wha ? ! Don 't tell me we took a detour to a place like this just so you could say that ! Would it have been so hard to say something like that while we walked ? ! I want you to join us after you 've been convinced of our organization 's way of thinking . Oh ? That 's fine . Go ahead and convince me . Right here , right now . She is ... Asuka is ... a psychic . I can 't believe it , just like that . Listen ! I 'm not going to . You said that you would show me to where the old man is , but you brought us here . As a play for Asuka 's sympathy , you trot out some fishy story of wanting her to save someone important ... What are you saying I should trust ? If you 're going to apologize , then start by not telling any more lies . Not to Asuka , either . Or else I 'll take her back , straight away . Here you are . Thank you ! If I hadn 't been ordered to , I would never come to a place like this . Don 't be so testy . Are you still worried about Double One Eight ? That 's not it . Sure , sure . Let 's make sure to search for her , just as were ordered to , okay ? You say that , but where is she ? Even if they tell us to tail her , we can 't do anything unless we find the target . We 'll find her soon . It 's times like this when you can rely on a woman 's intuition . Where 's Eiji ? Why won 't he come here ? The Chief was hurt in an accident , and is in the ICU right now . No visitors are allowed , either . Eiji 's been hurt ? ! It can 't be ... Just wait , Shin-lu . You 're hungry , aren 't you ? I 'm sorry , it 's because I took us on a detour . No , it 's not your fault , Maria . I haven 't eaten anything since this morning , and ... Neither have I. And so , do you mind if I treat you ? Do what you want . Asuka , what do you want ? Hey , hey , Yuuki , you should ... I 'm okay having just coffee . What ? Aren 't you going to eat ? I 'm saying that I can 't eat if she 's treating . Yuuki ! It 's not like I 'm hungry , so it 's all right if I don 't force myself to eat , right ? That 's not it ! That 's not what I mean . Meals should be pleasant and friendly ! I think that things taste better when it 's like that . Yuuki , why won 't you be friends with Maria ? You 're so kind , Asuka . What ? Me ? I 'm ... I think that you and Yuuki are the kind ones ... That 's why I want you to be friends . Listen , Asuka . I know that I 'm kind , but what part of this woman is ... I know she is ! That 's the feeling I get ... I can feel it ... You say you feel it ... in what way ? Like a breeze is caressing my hair ... When you 're near , a gentle wind blows ... Also , there are also times when I can hear things riding the wind ... How long have you had that power ? What ? I will take your order . Would you mind cutting the confusing and unsettling talk out ? If you don 't , right this minute I 'll ... That 's right . I 'm sorry ... To keep you waiting . I 'll have the crab and mushrooms in cream sauce . What about you , Asuka ? Why you ... you weren 't apologizing to me ? ! I wonder which one I should choose ... It looks like Yuuki isn 't going to eat , so let 's order a lot of desserts to make up for that ! Okay ! When you think on and on and you still can 't find an answer , there 's one thing to do . Move ahead without thinking . Consider what happens when it happens . Man , all that thinking has made me hungry . I guess I 'll let you treat me ! Sheesh ! Umm , I 'll take the pork saut√© and ... What happened to your woman 's intuition ? We haven 't found her ! Found her . Asuka ! Yuuki ! Asuka ! Yuuki ! What in the world happened ? Dear Kai , Yuuki and I are going to a place called the " guerillas ' base . " The room is a bit of a mess , but please don 't worry . The guerillas ' ... base ? The two of us had already started to get wet from the rapidly pouring rain We snuck out in a hurry , throwing away everything We wrapped our fingers together so that no one else could see it That 's our secret sign So take me away from here , take me right away Tonight midnight So don 't stop anymore , touch me right away Tonight , it 's true love The night that can 't return is going to begin Little by little , she 's falling apart . Shin-lu , Shin-lu ! I can 't tell what she 's feeling ! Her past , her memory , her personality , our mother . To prevent anything else from being lost , and so I can protect Shin-lu , I 'm going to make myself stronger !

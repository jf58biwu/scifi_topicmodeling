 [ BellRinging ] - But Professor- - - No . The answers are all there in the test . [ Chattering ] Aren 'tyou forgetting something ? I know . It 's something to dowith the third differential coefficient . - Not that . Tonight . - What ? Emma ? - What time is it ? - Almost 5 : 00 . Oh , God . [ Man ] Myproposal forutilizing solarpower , rejected . My concepts for harnessing micro-energy waves , rejected . The dean suggests that I focus on something that might actually help mankind . Like his study on the benefits oftobacco consumption . [ Man # 2 ] Alex , the problem is your ideas are a bit too ... radical . [ Alex ] The problem is with the faculty . They 're dinosaurs . They 're already extinct ; theyjust don 't know it . They 'll be discovered by some future archaeologist , and he won 't knowwhat to make ofthem . Theirdim little eyes , devoidofanycuriosity- - Alex , it 's your firstyear as associate professor . You might want to play things a little more conservatively . You sound just like myfather . Lookat them , Philby . All alike . All in identical bowler hats . Doyou wantyour students to turn out like that ? I want my students prepared forthe realities oftheworld they 're about to greet . Well , I don 't . I want them to run along this street and knockoff every bowlerthey see . Mrs. Watchit ! Oh , huzzah , the master 's home . - Did you get it ? - Hello , Mr. Philby . Hello , Mrs. Watchit . You 're looking in the pink . Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lad . - Don 't torture me . Did you get it ? - I got it . - Good . Let me see . - But don 'tyou think for one moment ... I 'm going to letyou go out in that filthyjacket . Now , go in there and change . And you 've got another letter from that annoying little man . [ Alex ] Well , goahead . Switch it on . - [ Whirring ] - It 'll helppeople keep theirteeth well into their 40s . - You might think about having that cleaned . - Oh , who has the time ? - How didyou know with Molly ? - Know what ? - You were meant to be together . - She made the best shepherd 's pie I ever tasted . Don 'tyou have a single romantic bone in your body ? No . I 'm all bowler hat . [ Dings , Buzzes ] Why doyou wasteyourtime on that crackpot ? Because he has some very interesting ideas . A professor at Columbia should not be corresponding with a crazyGerman bookkeeper . He 's a patent clerk , not a bookkeeper . I think Mr. Einstein deserves all the support I can give him . [ Sighs ] I wonder ifwe 'll ever go too far ? - With what ? - With this . With all ofthis . No such thing . All right . How do I look ? Practically decent . Really , Alex . Good lucktonight . She 's a fine girl . She 's done wonderful things foryou . Don 'tworry . You still have that alluring smell of chalk . Oh , gotta hurry . Now , that 's more like it . You looka proper gentleman for once . Well , you better hope so . If Emma turns me down , you 'll be next . - Oh , I 'm already swooning . - [ Clears Throat ] All right . Wish me luck . Thankyou . [ Woman ] Fresh flowers . Fresh flowers . - Have some flowers , sir . - Not tonight , thanks . No . I promised her flowers . [ Engine Sputtering ] Spectacular . Spectacularwaste ofmoney . Damn thing 's always breaking down . - [ Driver ] Doyouneeda lift ? - Yes , yes . - How doyou keep thewatertemperature stable ? - There 's a cantilevered gasket ... - on the fuel regulator- - - [ Revs ] Oh , God . Uh- - [ Blows Raspberry ] Much obliged . I 'm always forgetting the damn brake . Hop in . I 'll giveyou a perambulation before it breaks down again . Oh , uh , I 'm afraid I have a prior engagement . Well , anothertime then . We perambulate here most every night . Certainly . - [ Sputtering ] - [ Man ] Get a horse ! Yes . [ Woman ] Alexander ? [ Giggling ] - Oh ! Whoa . - [ Laughing ] - You 're late , Professor . - I got here as soon as I could . Well , they say it 's all the rage in Paris . But I just picked it up- - - Five dollars at Macy 's . Silly , isn 't it ? - Very silly . I like it . Well , where are they ? - What ? - The flowers . You promised me flowers tonight . Don 'tyou even remember ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I- - Well , I was distracted . Well , there 's something new . - Uh , Emma , I need to talk toyou . - [ Chuckling ] [ Exhales ] - Oh , uh , shall wewalk through the park ? - Yes . Professor , you 're shivering . I hope you 're not coming down with something . Well , I 'm afraid I am . I 'm not sleeping verywell , and even when I 'm awake , I 'm not much use . I can 't eat orthink or do much ofanything anymore . And theworst part is , I don 't know that I 'll ever bewell . I thinkthere 's only one remedy , and that 's foryou to marry me ... - and spend the rest ofyour life with me . - [ Gasps ] Oh , Emma , I know it 's right . I know we 're meant to be together . It 's the onlything in my entire life I 've never had to think about . Oh , Alex . Uh-Uh , wait . I have something foryou . [ Emma Chuckles ] You know , the moment is rather dying here . I-I know . Hold on . Oh . - I know it 's not a diamond . - A moonstone . Well , it 's your birthstone . I thought- - You thought right . [ Sighs , Giggles ] [ Man ] Ijustmight cry . I couldn 't help but overhear . Two fineyoung people starting out on the road oflife . - [ Chuckling ] - I wish you thevery best . - Well , thankyou . - And as much as I hate to do this- - moved as I am byyour ... protestations oflove- - I 'll be needing your money now . - Sir ? - And yourjewelry too . I guess we could call this yourfirst little bump on the road to marital bliss . - I don 't understand- - - Don 't make a scene . There 's no cause for that . - just give meyourwallet , will you ? - Hmm ? Did you hear me , lad ? Uh , all right , all right . Here . That 's everything . And yourwatch . And the gloves . - And the ring . - No . I 'm afraid so , darling . - And maybe he 'll buyyou a diamond now . - Please , please . Not that . Don 't ! [ Crying ] [ Panting ] Why did you do that ? It 's only a ring . [ Gasping ] Emma ? Emma ? Oh ! [ Sobbing ] [ Knocking ] - [ Knocking Continues ] - What ? Oh . Oh , sir , Mr. Philby 's here . - Here ? - Yes , sir . He insistedon coming- - - Tell him to go away . I 'm busy . - I won 't go away , Alex . My God . What 's happened to you ? I 've been- - I 've been working . You remember that ? You used to care aboutyourwork . I care more about my life . And yours . I came bythe house every day after the funeral ... and everyweek and every other month . Then I stopped coming . Did you even notice ? - It hurt me , Alex ... very much . - Then why areyou here now ? - There are some things I have to sayyou may not like hearing- - - I know . I know . You 're concerned . I know . I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day . But really ... I need you to go . - I won 't leave . Not with you hiding down here . - I 'm not hiding . You know that 's what it is . Mrs. Watchit says you 're in here all hours- - day and night . Alex , will you please stand still and look at me ! Itwasn 'tyourfault . No . Itwasn 't myfault . Maybewe should blame Mrs. Watchit for picking up the ring from thejeweler . Orthejewelerfor making it . Orthe poor bastard who tore the stone from the earth . Maybe I should blameyou for introducing me to Emma in the first place . Yes . Alexander , nothing will ever changewhat happened . No , you 'rewrong , because I will change it . David , I appreciate your concern . I do . But I askyou to have faith in me . Well , I-I want to have faith in you , Alex , but- - Wha- - What are- - What areyou doing here ? I 'll tell you what . Why don 'tyou come by for dinner in a week , and I 'll showyou ? - Why don 'tyou come home with me now ? Molly- - - Did you not hear me , David ? I can 't leave when I 'm so close . All right .

Never like this . - Heavens , look at that car . - Oh , I 've seen it . Now I knowyou 're ill . You 're passing up the chance to explore some new gadget . - It 's only a machine . - Alexander , tell me what 's going on . - Is something wrong ? - No . No . Emma , listen to me . I need to leaveyou now , but I wantyou to go straight home and stay there . I promiseyou I 'll come by sometime latertonight , and I won 't make any sense . I 'll be all upset thatyou didn 't meet me in the park , butyou must trust me . Everything will be all right . Just know how much I loveyou , how much I 'll always loveyou . All right .

[ Chuckles Halfheartedly ] - I don 't believe it . - Well , ifyou don 't like the answers , you should avoid asking the questions . Look at them .

Some managedtostayabove . The rest ofus escapedunderground . Then centuries later , when we tried to reemerge into the sun again , we couldn 't . So we bred ourselves into castes . Some to be our eyes and ears . - Some to be our muscles and sinews . - You mean , your hunters . Yes . Bred to be predators , but bred also to be controlled . You see , my caste concentrated ... on expanding our cerebral abilities . - You control their thoughts . - Not just theirs . The Eloi . So it 's not enough thatyou hunt them down like animals . - That 's their role here . - To beyourfood ? Yes . And forthosewho are suitable , to be breeding vessels ... for our other colonies .

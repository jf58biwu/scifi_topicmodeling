Tell me . I need all to continue to do his job . I think you got more questions for me . I have one for you . I need frequencies subspaþiale Federal border protection . Especially in the area of the Earth . Christopher , answer my question . No , you answer to genocide committed against a peaceful people . I p ® evented the genocide . In time to come , it is a mining vessel . I chose a life of honest work . Let me have a wife pregnant . I was left on the planet and I was doing the job ta Federation and he did nothing . I left to burn people planet when its broken in two . Spock And we helped . He betrayed . Are you confused and poorly informed . Romulus was destroyed . I still exist . Blame Federation what not happened yet . I happened . I saw with my eyes . Do not tell me that never happened . And when I lost her , I swore revenge . And for 25 years , I planned vendetta against the Federation . I forgot how to go a normal life . But I forgot the pain . The pain that you feel now all survivors volcano .

You have confirmed that Nero is heading for Earth ? their trajectory shows other destination , Captain . Thank you , It . Earth could be next stop , but must assume that all planets Federation are targeted . Get up on the chair . If the Federation is the target , us what we have destroyed ? Why waste ammo There was a threat . No e . He said that he wanted to show me thing : the destruction of my planet . And how did that ? How did they put romulanii hands on such weapons ? technical knowledge necessary to create artificially in a black hole suggests an answer . A technology may also be used theoretically to create a tunnel the space-time . What the hell ? I am a doctor , not physicist . suggesting that came from the future somehow ? If you eliminate the impossible , what remains , however improbable , the truth . What poetic . Why would an angry romulan future with captain Pike ? E master . Know details about defensive systems . We need to get of the ship , so incapacitãm and make it up on the Pike . We are the technological inferiority . A rescue attempt is preposterous . Nero 's ship should be out of the warp so that we get . To ask the technicians to work at warp speed boost . The crew working on repairing radiation leaks on lower decks . There must be a way . You must join to equal Fleet sorþii next conflict . I will be no further conflict . When we are together will be too late . You said it was the future and knows what happens . It 's logical to be unpredictable . You assume that Nero knows how events will take place . Instead , the presence of Nero changed our history since the attack on USS Kelvin , events culminating in today 's creating a new chain of events can not be anticipated by anyone . A parallel reality . Right . Whatever has been our lives if it was not disturb space-time continuum , Our destinies have changed . Mr. Sulu , to enter the course Laurentian . Warp 3 . Spock , do not do that . Go back to the fleet is a big waste of time ... These are orders Captain Pike when he left . We ordered more go back to rescue him . - Spock , you are the master now . - I know the responsibilities . With every second wasted , Nero approaching its target . Right . Therefore , please admit that I own ... No to let give bir fugiþii with instead of hunting him on Nero . Security , escorting him out . - No . - Jim ! To disappear from the ship . Computer , where are they ? On Delta Vega , the planet Class M. uncertain . There is an outpost of Fleet 13 km north-west . - Stay in capsule ... - kidding . stellar Date : 2258.42 . ... 4 times ... never mind . Captain Spock provisional abandoned me on Delta Vega . I consider this a breach of protocol security 49.09 , on treatment prisoners on board . James T. Kirk . - What ? - How did you find ? How do you know my name ? I am and always will be your friend . Listen , you know . I am Spock . Rubbish . I am delighted to see you , buddy . Especially after the events today . I am grateful that helped me today , but if you Spock , you know that we are not friends . I hate . Have you abandoned here for sedition . - uprising - Yes . So are you captain ? Do not . You are the captain . Pike was taken hostage . For Nero ? What do you know about him ? It 's a very disturbed romulan . Please . Allow me . It will be easier . - What are you doing ? - We will merge minds . More than 129 years , a star will explode and threaten to destroy the galaxy . Is that where I come from , Jim . The future . Steaua became supernova . destroy everything in your way . I promised romulanilor co to save the planet . I have fitted the fastest ship . Using material red after to create a black hole that would absorb star hit . I was on the road when a catastrophe occurred . Supernova has destroyed Romulus . There was time . I had to extract the material red and so throw the supernova . When to start on the road return , I was intercepted . She said Nero , last of the Romulan Empire . In an attempt to escape , both I was captured by the black hole . Nero passed first and arrived first . For the next 25 years , he expected arrival . But while Nero years have passed have passed to me just seconds . We went through a black hole . And I expect Nero . I quarrel with me loss of his world . I caught a ship and he spared my life . From a single reason : to know the pain . Ma Teleport here to private revenge . Just as he has not been able save planet no I do not I could it save mine . Billions of lives lost because of me , Jim . Because I failed . Forgive me . Transfer emotional e effect of contopirii minds . - So you nervous . - Yes . Getting your time changed our lives . Jim ! Let 's go . Not far from here , is an outpost of the Fleet . Wait . where you live I met my father ? Yes . I often say that he has inspired to enlist in the parc . He lived to be proud that you captain on the Enterprise . Captain ? A ship that should come back as soon as possible . - Speed constant . - Course 151 , vector 3 . - The Laurentian . - Thank you , gentlemen . - Did you call ? - Yes , Doctor . I know that James Kirk is your friend . I imagine that has been difficult to get support . I thank ? - I just recognize the difficulties . - Permission to speak freely . - Please . - Really ? Okay . Have you lost your mind vulcaniene ? It 's the logical choice to remove him Kirk Probably . But it is correct ? We have a proverb . If you want to participate in a race in Kentucky , do you let the stallion barn . curious metaphor , Doc . Stallion must tamable before-and fructify potential . You could even pretend you that was a tough decision . I intend to make every effort to restore contact with Fleet . But if I can cheer bocind crew on hallways , I will be happy medical recommendations . Excuse me . green monkey blood . What ? You know how unacceptable 's situation ? - Fascinating . - What ? I am sure that you work , but he could not have come sooner ? I 'm here for six months , living in cans and the promise of good meals . And I know exactly how things stand . There are still punished for what was clearly an accident . - You Montgomery Scott . - You know him ? Yes , I am . You 've come to the right place . Only if no other officer 's Fleet as toiling and hungry here . - I. - Shut up . You do not do anything . Eat only one grain and you sick . I real food . But now you are here so where is it ? Are you that Scott who developed teleportãrii transwarp theory . For this is about . How do I get here ? I had a little dispute with my instructor in matters of physical relativist how to link to subspaþialã trip . He thinks that range transport is a kind of grapefruit . The limit to 160 km . I said that not only can Teleport a grapefruit from one planet to another in the same system , which what is pretty easy , but the forms of life . I tested on copoiul Admiral Archer . I know the dog . What happened ? I will tell you when reappears . I do not know . I feel somewhat guilty . If I say that theory transwarp is correct ? That is possible to Teleport on a ship traveling at warp ? If there would have been discovered , I have heard of it . The reason that I have heard of it , Mr Scott , is that I have discovered it yet . - Are you in the future ? - Yes . It 's Me , no . Great . Have sandwiches there ? It 's a little old . But to handle . I 've changed it a bit . Everything is ready . So went Enterprise for the first time in space ? It is a well endowed lady . I would like to put a hand on nacelele general . Forgive technical language . Even if I believe what I say what we do , where you live what do not believe everything remains the problem teleportãrii the Enterprise when traveling at speeds supraluminice , without a platform upon arrival . Get out . No room for climbing . The concept of teleportare transwarp 's like trying to hit a bullet with another smaller when you are blindfolded and ride a horse . What 's this ? The equation for ta teleportare transwarp . Let 's see . I imagine . I went in thinking that is the mobile space . Come with us , right ? No , Jim . This is not my destiny . Destiny ... Spock no other I believe . But you can explain them . He must not know of my existence . Promise me . I can not say that you follow your orders . Why not ? What happens ? Jim , you should not break this rule . To block Nero , you alone must take command of the ship . How ? Over your dead body ? Preferably not . But there are rules Fleet 619 . Under 619 , if an officer commanding 's emotional compromise of mission quit must command . So everything we do is to compromise your emotional ? Jim , I lost planet . I 'm already emotionally compromised . Pregnancy 's push to get to show this . Okay . If you go , come on . Have you how to live with me . Go . Let 's go back in time and change history means to cheat . I learned that from a old friend . Life long and prosperous . Mr Scott ? Mr. Scott , can you hear me ? Wait a minute . Do not . valve opening Start valve opening . Are you okay ? My head is spinning and wet , but the rest are okay . Captain Spock , detect access Third to the tank water . Displays on display . Security , isolate the engine room . We intruders in Section 3 . Set phasers on paralysis . Wait . Come with me avarice . Who are you ? - I am with him . - It 's me . Getting to warp speed . How you Teleport on the ship ? You are genius . Find yourself . As a provisional captain the ship , I order you to answer me . And I do not respond provisional captain . You are not upset or mad by my lack of cooperation , right ? - You are the membuat Fleet - Yes . I need a towel . The death Court martial I order to explain how did you ship the Teleport while we go to warp . I respond . You answer me . - I prefer to remain neutral . - What 's with you , Spock ? Planeta he was destroyed , my mother , and killed are not upset at all . If you assume that these experiences I affect the ability to order ship you wrong . But you say that fear is required to order . I have seen the ship ? You saw what he did ? - Of course yes . - So you afraid , right ? Do not you let me hold sermons about emotions . - Then do not stop me ? - Get away from me . How is it you feel anger ? Or despair ? Or the need to retaliate by whatever means the death of your mother . - Get away from me . - I feel nothing ! Probably does not mean anything to you . Have you ever loved her . Spock . Doctor , you are apt to serve . order release based on the fact that I was emotionally compromised . Evaluate the time and date in the log ship . I like the ship . It was exciting . Congratulations , Jim . Now we have no captain nor first officer to replace him . I have . - What ? - Pike called him first officer . - No kidding . - Thank you for support . I hope you know what you do , captain . I hope so too . Warning , the Enterprise crew . Here James Kirk . Mr. Spock gave up the post and called me me master provisional . I know you expect to join the fleet . But I will start tracking enemy ship for Earth . All departments and positions battle to be ready in 10 minutes . And you perish in November , or her . Kirk finished . Say what troubling you , Spock . It would be unwise . What you need not ever cautious . I am as confused as in childhood . You should always be a child of two worlds . I am happy for that . And for you . I feel anger at who killed my mother . An anger that no one can wield . My thoughts , as she said is not to try . I once asked you why I married your mother . I got married because I loved her . Either way , you must get the ship undetectable to Nero . You will not have barged in there with gun in hand , Jim . The calculations do not support your idea . - Captain Kirk . - Yes , Chekov . What ? Analyzing the Naradei from Vulcan I have determined that Nero will pass Saturn . As you said we should hide by Nero , otherwise we will destroy them . If Mr. Scott succeeds warp speed to 4 , and if you leave the warp behind one of the months of Saturn , such as Titan , magnetic distortion planet 's rings we will be invisible sezorii for his Nero . From there , while probe not on , We can Teleport to the enemy ship . Yes . It might work . - Wait . Kid , how old are you ? - 17 , sir . Has 17 years . Doctor . Mr. Chekov is right . I confirm data telemetry . If Mr. Sulu brings us in a favorable position , I will ship to the Teleport Nero , I will steal the black hole , and , if possible , would bring back Captain Pike . Do not let you do that , Mr Spock . Romulanii and vulcanienii have a common ancestry . cultural similarities will help me to access the computer and locate the device . My mother was human . Earth e only homeland I have left . Friday with you . I would cite the regulation , but I know that to ignore it . See ? Already begin to know . Prepare probe . Stop full 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Go for 5 seconds at quarter speed boost . Then go on propulsion . At my signal . Yes . Run . Transport Hall . We are in position above the Titanic . Really ? Bravo , Mr Sulu . - Situation , Scotty - Unbelievable . The ship is heading . Anything that would happen , Mr Sulu , if you consider that the tactical advantage to pull the ship that even if you are on board . It 's an order . Yes , sir . We will contact you when we are Enterprise Teleport ready to be back . Good luck . - I will be back . - So be it . - O you monitor frequency . - Thank you , Nyota . - First it 's Nyota - No comment . Okay . If the enemy ship was built logically a Teleport to the cargo hold , where no one . Enable . Captain , Fleet officers we approached the ship . - One of them is vulcanian . - No . Ayel . - Learn what you can . - Are you sure ? Yes . I cover you . You know where the hole negeri ? And Captain Pike . Move . They enabled the probe . Communications and teleportarea does not work . Sulu , tell me that i have located . Otherwise I will not be able Teleport back . Kirk and Spock are on their own . provide complications . Ship model is more advanced than I expected . Voice print analysis facial recognition enabled . Welcome , Ambassador Spock . Weird . Computer , which is the date of manufacture ? Date stellar 2387 . Ordered Vulcanianã Academy of Sciences . It seems that you hid important information . Can you fly the ship , right ? I feel that I have piloted it . - Good luck . - Jim . Statistically speaking , chances of success is less than 4.3 % . I work . If I back tell It . Uhura ... Spock , one to go . Fascinating . startup sequence initiated . Nero , ordered disable probe that does not ... You know the face in the history of Earth . James T. Kirk was considered grand man . He became captain of the USS Enterprise . But that was another life . A life that I missed , as I did with your father . Captain Nero . Ship vulcanianã was stolen . We destroyed the probe . Spock ! - Open a channel . - Yes , sir . Spock , I had to kill you when I had the chance . confiscate illegally acquired this ship and I order you to surrender unconditional ship . Shoot him . - Sir , if red light matter ... - Spock I want the dead . - go to warp . - Watch it . Yes , sir . Your species is lower than I expected . You can not talk to . What ? I got my gun . What to do ? Ambassador Spock , are on collision course . Fire all weapons . launched missiles . If the ship is hit , red material will ignite . I understand . Captain , detect another ship . - What are you doing here ? - Follow orders . Enterprise , now ! Good timing , Scotty . I never Teleport three people from two different places on one platform . - Jim . - Bones . It was remarkable . Captain , the enemy lost ship supply . They dropped the shields . - Call them now . - Yes . Here Captain James T. Kirk the USS Enterprise . The ship 's compromised . It 's too close to singularity to survive without which we are willing to offer him . Captain , what are you doing ? compassion may be the only way to win peace with Romulus . It 's logical , Spock . I co you like . Not this time . I prefer to see die Romulus a thousand times , I prefer to die in agony Just accept your help . You got it . Aim phasers . Pull with all weapons . Yes , sir . - Sulu , go home . - Yes , sir . - Why are not the warp - You are , sir . Kirk to the engine room . Take us out of here , Scotty . To be sure , Captain . Captain , we are caught the gravity field . Maximum speed warp . Now . You give everything you are , Captain . Well , everything is not enough . What other ideas do you have ? If you evacuate warp core and it detonated , is likely to burst free , but not promising anything . Do it ! - Clear the area . - Yes , sir . Pa ? You are our father . They left few vulcanieni . We afford to ignore . Then why did you sent the ship Kirk , when you could explain to me the truth ? Because had needed each other . Do not want to miss a chance to achieve great things together a friendship that will define both the ways in which still no figures . How did you sure to keep secret ? He inferred that appear paradoxes catastrophic for the universe if it will violate the promise . You lied . - I insinuative . - A bet ? An act of faith . Which I hope to repeat it in your future in Starfleet Fleet . We are faced with extinction . It 's logical to resign from the fleet and to help rebuild our race . But can you be in two places at once . I suggest you stay in the fleet . I found a planet suitable for vulcaniene foundation of a colony . Spock , make your own good in this case . Let logic and do what you feel is good . The traditional greeting I feel selfish , I just wish you luck . Meeting his name Captain James Tiberius Kirk . Your courage and inspiring devotion from comrades falls in the best traditions of Fleet . And I do honor you , and your crew Federation . I am honored to have your agreement this medal . Of Fleet Order 28455 , you to present the Admiral Pike the USS Enterprise to replace him . take command , sir . Sermons order . - Thank you , sir . - Congratulations , captain .

Command docului report that is done , Captain . Bones . Put your seat belt . Scotty , how we doin ' ? dilitiu room is full , Captain . Get out . Mr. Sulu , get ready to enable propulsoarele . Requesting permission to get on board , Captain . Permission granted . How you have not yet chosen a first officer , I wish to offer applications . If you want , can present letters of recommendation . I would be honored , Commander . Propulsoarele maneuvering , Mr Sulu . - Propulsoarele prepared . - Get us out of here . Yes , Captain .

Um , My Guess Is They 're Either In 1863 Listening To Lincoln Give The Gettysburg Address , Or They Just Popped Into The Ozone . Our Best Bet Is To Reenter The Recalculated Ignition Sequence And Run Through The Entire Procedure Again . What We Didn 't Find Out Until A Lot Later , Was That When Einstein Took The Vector Modulator , The Fish Didn 't Travel Back In Time .

So , That 's How It All Started . I Have No Intention Of Playing With You . Ok , All Right , Let 's Say That We Just Believe All Of This . Well , Now What ? You 're The Scientists , We Were Kind Of Hoping You 'd Tell Us . So , We Sent Our 21-Year-Old Parents Back Into The Lab To Try To Figure Out How To Become 40 Again . Wow ! This Is Incredible . And You 're Actually Saying That Silly Billy Gates , Who I Tutored In Calculus , Is Responsible For All Of This ? Yeah , Dad . Now Get Over It ! Focus ! Eddie And I Are Gonna Go Up And Make Dinner . You Guys Keep Working . You Know , Marigold , I Bet What We 're Looking For Is Tied Directly Into That Last Goldfish Experiment . But Norton , Those Fish Didn 't De-Age . They Just Disappeared . That Is What Trips Me Out . What If They Started By De-Aging And Then ... Oh ... Poof ! Oh . It 's So Weird Seeing Them At 21 . Nortykins And Mari-Muffin . I Know . They 're ... Slammin ' . I Mean , What If They Stay Like This ? Making Out And Singing Hits Of The Seventies . I Can 't Believe There Are Actually People Right Across The Street Who Live Normal Lives . I Know . Kids ! We Need To Talk . We Don 't Want You To Panic , Because Everything , Ultimately , Is Going To Be Cool . But We Do Seem To Be Facing A Bit Of A , Uh ... Situation . Situation . This Doesn 't Sound Good . The Good News Is That Nortykins And I Are Sure That We 've Discovered What Happened To Those Goldfish . And The Bad News ? They Didn 't Go Time Traveling , They Went Poof . What ? What ? They ... Poofed . Well , In Layman 's Terms , They Regressed Themselves Right Out Of Existence . That 's Layman 's Terms ? Wait , Wait . So You 're Saying That The Fish Got Younger And Younger Until Finally They ... Disappeared ? Exactly . Right On ! Is What Happened To The Goldfish Gonna Happen To You ? Are You Two Gonna Poof And Disappear , Too ? Marie , Chill Out . Nortykins And I , We Are Going To Carefully Examine The Data Downstairs To Determine Where The Experiment Went Wrong- - And Fix It . Did We Have Any Colleagues , Anyone Who Would Know Anything About This ? No . I Mean , This Was All Part Of Some Top-Secret , Schro-Something Or Other Grant . That 's Why The College Moved Your Lab Into The House . All Right , So , Do You Have Any Idea Of How Long Until You Poof ? Actually , We Do , To The Precise Second . We Calculated The Time It Took For The Goldfish To Vanish , Factored In Their Life Expectancy Versus Ours . Then , In A Worst-Case Scenario , We 'll Reach Poof Point At Precisely 6 : 01 Tomorrow Evening . My Goodness . Kids , It 's After Midnight ! Don 't You Wanna Go Upstairs And Crash ? No Chance . That Clock Hits Zero , You Guys Are History . We 're Staying Right Here To Make Sure Nothing Happens To You Guys . Norton , We Are Going To Raise Teenagers Who Actually Want To See Their Parents Live . Oh ! O-O-Oh ! I Got It . I Figured It Out , Norton ! I Know What We Have To Do ! Norton , I Know What We Have To Do To Save Ourselves ! What Is It , Marigold ? What Went Wrong ? How Do We Fix It ? Well , Well , It 's Really Quite Simple , Actually . As You Can See , According To My Calculations ... And Just When I Thought Everything Was Gonna Be Cool ... All We Ever Really Needed Was- - Guess What ? Marigold , What 's Happening ? I ... Mom And Dad De-Aged Again . What Are You Doing ? Stop ! The Solution , We- - Whoa-Oh-Oh ! That Was Too Bizarre ! Are You Two All Right ? I 'm Superfine . I Don 't Know Who You Are . Subjects De-Aged To 14 Years . Matter Of Fact , I Don 't Even Know Where I Am . Well , That Makes Two Of Us . Although I Do Know You , Norton Ballard , And After The Way You Behaved At The Science Fair , I Never Want To Talk To You Again . So Now You See The Nightmare We Found Ourselves In . And As It Turns Out , That Was Nothing Compared To What Happened Next . Our Parents Turned Into Hormonal Teenagers Just Like Us ! And We Had To Deal With Them ! I Know It Doesn 't Make Any Sense , I Know It Sounds Insane , But It 's The Truth . What Can I Do To Get You To Believe Me ? See This Zit ? It 's Just Starting . But Trust Me , It 'll Be All Over My Face , Probably In Time For Picture Day . Norton ? You Play The Guitar ? Since When ? Since Forever . What Are You Doing In There , Marigold ? Come On Out . Oh ... What Do You Think ? Um , Ha ... Well , You ... I Don 't Know . Well , Doesn 't It Look Like This On You , Though ? No . Uhh ! No , I Mean , Yes . It 's Just That You Just Kind Of ... Uh , You Look Fine . Yeah , Well , How Can I Expect You To Relate ? I Mean , You 're- - You 're Beautiful . Everyone Says I Look Like You . Oh , Yeah . I Wish . I Mean , I Am A Science Geek , Marie ... Who Looks Like A Science Geek . But Wouldn 't You Think That A Guy Would Want To Be With Someone Who Was His Intellectual Equal ? I Don 't Understand Why Norton Feels So Threatened By Me . But I 'll Tell You One Thing . I Am Not Gonna Dumb Myself Down For Him . No . In The Name Of All The Sisters In The Movement , I Will Never , Ever Do That , Not For Norton Ballard Or Any Other Dumb Guy . You Know , What Wigs Me Out In My Mind So Bad I Can Barely Breathe Is The Fact That Marigold Wilmoth Has The Nerve To Think She 's As Smart As Me . That 's Why She 's Not Talking To Me . I Told Her I Could Kick Her Keister Anytime In A Science Bowl , And Now She 's All Bent Out Of Shape . Norton , You 're Not 14 . You 're 40 . You Were 14 In 1974 . It 's A Whole New Millennium ! If You Don 't Start Believing Me , You 're Gonna Poof Out Of Existence , I Won 't Have Parents , And--And ... You Won 't Have A Life , And ... I 'm Sorry To Be Dumping All This On You , But If You 're Not Gonna Be The Grownup , Who Is ? I Don 't Know What To Do ! Ok , Whoa . You Are Just A Little Too Intense , This Is All Too Heavy , And I Feel Like My Head Is Just About To Explode . Oh , Believe Me , Mom , I Can Relate . Oh , Don 't Call Me Mom . This Is So Radical . There 's A Channel On Your Tv That Plays Nothing But Rock And Soul Music . Have You Seen It ? Yeah , Norton . Welcome To The World . I Completely Dig It . Sounding Good , My Man , Sounding Very Good . Recording Yourself So You Can Learn From The Playback . Mondo Smart , Dude . Ready For The Audition ? Today ? Duh . That 's Today ? Uh ... Uh ... Colin , I Just Can 't . Ok ? I Can 't . These Guys Aren 't Gonna Wait For You . I Mean , What Are You Thinking ? It 's Today . 3 : 00 . And You Better Be Amazing . Just Because I Got A 79 On My Psats Doesn 't Mean I 'm A College Professor . I Mean , I Don 't Know Zip About Any Of This Stuff . Obviously . I Understand More Than You Do , Norton . Huh . You Wish . I Know . Now , I Can Make Out What Some Of Those Equations Are About , And I Totally Get The Concept Of Time 's Arrow . Duh ! Who Wouldn 't ? Us . Us . Which Is Why We Were Kind Of Hoping You Two Could Work Together On This . Yeah , Well , It 's About His Attitude . Norton Thinks He 's Too Good To Ever Need A Partner . Oh , I 'm Not The One Who Made The Whole 9th-Grade Chemistry Class Barf Because She Made An Accidental Stink Bomb Because She Wouldn 't Ask For Help . Well , Excuse Me . Can We Just Talk About The Time You Melted Mr. Schiller 's Belt 'Cause You Wouldn 't Let Me Show You How To Use The New Bunsen Burner ? Guys , Can We Just Call A Truce Here ? Why Don 't You Ask Her ? She 's The One Who Started It . I Did Not ! Do You Guys Have A Bathroom Down Here ? It 's In The Back Corner . Come With Me . Ok ? Please ? Right Now . There They Go . You Ever Notice How They Go To The Bathroom In Pairs ? It 's Like A Girl 's Noah 's Ark . Hee Hee Hee Hee ! I Don 't Get It . I Mean , I Just Don 't Get It . I Mean , Why Does He Make Me Feel Like This ? My Face , It Gets All Hot , And My Knees Go All Gooey . Because You Two Are Way In Love . Tch . Try Way In Hate . Norton , He Just Feels So Threatened By Me , And His Mom , Oh , His Mom , She Totally Can 't Stand Me . Yeah , Well , That Hasn 't Really Changed , But You 've Gotten Used To It . I Don 't Even Know What I 'm Thinking . I Can 't Get Serious About A Boy Now . I Mean , I 've Got My Whole Life Ahead Of Me . Yeah . A Life With Norton . Oh ! Uh-Uh . No , No . Uh-Uh , Uh-Uh . It Is Just Too Crazy To Think That Norton Ballard Is The Guy That I End Up With . Well , You Better Get Over It , Because He Is . This Is Just So Unfair . It 's Just So Unfair . What ? It 's Just ... Being Our Age And Wanting To , You Know , Be Cool And In Control , When All The Time , What You Really Feel Is ... Just Lost , Like , All The Time . Whoa . What ? Why Are You Looking At Me Like That ? Oh , My Gosh , Do I Have A Booger Or Something ? It 's Just ... I 'm Blown Away . I Mean , I Had No Idea You Felt This Stuff . And I Can 't Believe You 're Sharing It With Me . Well , Why Not ? I Think You 're Great . And The Truth Is , I Feel ... I Feel Like I Could Talk To You For Hours . Would It Be Ok If I Gave You A Hug ? Yeah , ' Cause I Could Definitely Use One Right About Now . Me , Too . Ok . I Think You 're So Cool , Marie . I Think You 're Cooler . Eddie ? Norton ? Where 'd They Go ? Eddie ! Dad ? Norton ... Since When Do You Play Guitar ? He 's Always Played The Guitar . Check Him Out , Marie . He Is Phat . I 'm Not Fat . I 'm Big-Boned . You Could Certainly Teach Me A Thing Or Two . Excelente . I Would Love To . See , I Got This Audition Of A Lifetime To Try Out For This Tight Band Called Urban Slugs , And Norton 's Helping Me Get Ready For It . Hey , What 's The Deal ? How Come Your Skateboard Has A Handle ? Have You Forgotten About Our Little Problem Here ? No , Not At All . See , Here 's What I 'm Thinking . Since Mom And Dad Always Want To Fight About Everything , Maybe It Would Make More Sense For You To Go Down In The Lab And Work With Mom , And I Stay Up Here And Keep An Eye On Dad . Or In Other Words , Dump The Tough Stuff On My Shoulders So You Can Hide Out With Jimi Hendrix Over There . Come On , Marie . The Guys Are Gonna Be Here At 3 : 00 . Yeah , And At 6 : 00 , There 's A Good Chance We Can Be Orphans . Norton ? Marigold ? Where 'd They Go ? Oh , No . They 're Not Here . Where Could They Be ? I Don 't Know . They 're Not Down In The Lab . I Don 't Get It . Where Could They Possibly Have Gone ? What Were They Thinking ? Where Would They Go ? Um , Excuse Me , Mrs. Cook . Do You Know Where My Parents- - Oh , Marie , Dear . What A Coincidence . I Was Just About To Call Over To Your House . That 's Great , Ms. Cook , But I Really Need To- - Apparently We 're Not The Only Ones In The Neighborhood Losing Patience With Your Parents . Come , I Want To Show You Something . Um , Mrs. Cook , Right Now Really Isn 't A Good Time . Would You Rather I Spoke To Them Directly ? Do You Know Where They Are ? Don 't You ? You Know , I Don 't Want To Sound Like Twilight Zone Here Or Anything , But Are You Starting To Feel Like We Landed On A Totally Different Planet ? Where 's My House ? Where 's My Tree Fort ? Where 's Mr. Frizzle 's Grave ? Mr. Frizzle ? My Lab Mouse . Whose Bright Idea Was It To Take Away Everything I Love And Put A Stupid Park In Its Place ? You Know , Norton , I 'm Starting To Feel Like Eddie And Marie Were Telling Us The Truth . No Way , Marigold . That 's Too Weird . Yeah , Really Weird , But Do You Have A Better Explanation , Sherlock ? I Mean , Come On . What Are We Gonna Do Now ? Our Only Real Choice Is To Go Back To The Lab And See What We Can Figure Out . Whoa ! I Can 't Believe For The First Time In My Life , I Actually Agree With You . So , What Street Do They Live On ? Oh , Norton , Come On . Don 't You Know ? No . Well , Let 's Just Go Back The Way We Came From . Ok ? Come On . Come On , Let 's Go . You Guys . Boys Don 't Ask For Directions . You Should Have Just Asked For Directions , Norton ! Which Way Do We Go ? I Don 't Know ! Norton ! Unh ! Norton ! Norton ! Hey , There You Are . Where 's Marigold ? I Don 't Know . We Had Another Dumb Fight . We Got All Lost Trying To Get To Your Pad , And She Got All Bugged Out , Saying I Was Yelling At Her When I Wasn 't . Nice Bike ! Whoa . I Mean , She Is So Sensitive .

Watch This . I Wish Marigold Could See This . She Wouldn 't Believe It . Unh ! Don 't You Have A Girlfriend ? What 's Wrong ? Uh ... I Think That 's The First Time You Ever Asked Me About My Social Life . Well , If I 'm Your Father , Like You Claim , Don 't We Talk ? Well ... Not Really . I Mean , You 're Always Sort Of Too Busy Or Whatever . Sounds Like My Father . That 's A Bummer , Man . That 's Not The Type Of Father I Want To Be . Hey , Don 't Beat Yourself Up . I Mean , Your Work 's Really Important To You . Work , Schmirk . Check This Out . Up , Up , And Away . Oh , Yeah ! Whoo ! Ha Ha ! Oh , How Could You Do It , Girl ? It 's Like--Like , Straight From My Heart And Into Your Mouth . Dang , You 're Good . Mrs. Ballard ... Yeah , Right . Like That 's Ever Gonna Happen . Are ... You Ok ? Look , No Offense , Ok ? But Do I Even Know You ? I 'm Cloe . I Go To School With Marie . Listen , I Don 't Mean To Sound Nosy Or Anything , But You Seem Totally Sad . Well ... Cloe , Right ? Ok .

The Robergs ' Crystal Chandelier Is In A Shambles , The Franzens Claim That Their Dog Has Lost All Bladder Control . Obviously , We Realize It 's Not Your Fault That Your Parents Are , Uh ... A Little Eccentric ? Well , I Was Going To Say Freaks , But That 's Ok . Nonetheless , Corky Has Started A Petition , And More Than Half The Neighborhood Has Already Signed It . A Petition For What ? Unless They Cease And Desist Operating A Scientific Lab In A Residential Neighborhood , We 'll Bring Out A County Inspector ... And File A Motion To Have Your Family Evicted . What ? But You Can 't . I Mean , Not Now . Definitely , Oh , Not Now . You See , They 're ... Look , Whatever You Think You Have To Do , You Just Can 't Do It Today . Believe Me . Please . It 's Just So Bizarre , Because Marie Hasn 't Said Anything About Having Some Huge Crush . I Bet It 's Colin . He 's There All The Time With Eddie . He 's Really Cute . Uh , Cloe , I Think You Just Ran Over About Half A Town . Oh , You Are Toast . Oops . My Bad . So , This Other Thing . Mrs. B. Told Me That The Urban Slugs Are Playing Over At Their House Later . Really ? Yeah , It Sounded Like She Was Hoping It Was Gonna Turn Into Some Huge Graduation Party . Which Means We Should Start Inviting Kids . Ok . We 'll Go Get The Guys At The Counter . And I 'll Start Doing My Phone Thing . So , With Less Than 6 Hours Left Until Poof Point , Dad And I Did What Anyone Facing Oblivion Would Do . We Jammed . Um , Forgive Me Once Again For Being The Voice Of Sanity Here , But ... Where 's Marigold ? Excuse Me . What The- - Ooh . How Do You Like That , Norton Ballard ? Oh , Um ... Uh ... Mom , What 's Up With That ? It 's Time I Started Acting Like A Modern Woman , According To Your Friend Cloe . Cloe ? Cloe Weber Is The Meanest , Most Gossipy Girl In Our Whole Class . Well , Didn 't She Think It Was Kind Of Weird That Our Mom Was Acting Like She Was 14 ? Well , Cloe Was Very Clear That These Days , If A Girl Really Wants Something , She Does Not Have To Sit Around And Wait For The Boy To Make The First Move . So ... What The Heck ... What Do You Say , Norty ? About What ? Norton Ballard ... Will You Go Steady With Me ? Come On . We Need To Get Back To The Lab . Norton , I Know You 're In Here . Norton , You 're Being Ridiculous . Well , You Don 't Know What It 's Like . You Don 't Have A Girlfriend . You Don 't Know How It Feels . Nobody Knows How I Feel ! Gee , Haven 't Heard That One Since ... Yesterday , When I Said It . The Countdown Clock Doesn 't Care About Any Of This . It 's Ticking . Look , I 'm Sorry If You 're Gonna Have To Put Your Little Anxiety Attack On Hold , But It 's Getting Really Crucial Here . I 'm A Teenager . This Is Supposed To Be The Best Time Of My Life , And All I 'm Feeling Is Pressure . And I Can 't Handle It ! You 're Not The Only One That 's Having A Little Bit Of Trouble With This ! Being 14 Has Never Been Easy . Ask Any Of My Friends . But You Have To Come Out And Deal With It . Ok . I 'll Come Out . Thank You . Ok , You Can Handle This . I Know You Can Handle This . It 's Just Some Dumb Girl . A Dumb Girl Can 't Tell You What To Do . Dumb Girl . Girl , Girl . No ! No , No ! I Can 't ! I Can 't ! What If I Can 't Figure Out The Formula ? I 've Been Only Programmed For Success . The Fear Of Failing Flips Me Out ! I Can 't ! No ! Man , You Got To Stop Stealing My Lines . Whoa ! I Don 't Believe It . How Did This Get Down Here ? Did Norton Finish This Without Me ? I Don 't Know . You Know , It 's Been Here Forever . You Know , I Think It 's Just Some Old Project Of Yours . It 's An Energy Ball . We 're Working On It For Next Year 's Science Fair . Isn 't This Wild ? What Does It Do ? Well , That 's The Problem . We Spend So Much Time Arguing , We Never Seem To Get It Done . Where 's Norton ? In The Greenhouse , Having A Godzilla-Sized Nervous Breakdown . It 's All About Me , Right ? I Knew It . I Knew It . I Knew I Should Never Have Been So Aggressive . Eddie , Please Tell Her She 's Being Ridiculous . Well ... He Did Say That Every Time He Pictures Her Looking At Him , He Feels Like Throwing Up . I Realized That The Only Way To Get Them Back On Track Was To Do To Them What Mom And Dad Do To Me And My Sister When We Go At It . I Sat Them Down And Told Them That No One Was Gonna Leave The Room Until They Had A Compromise . And , Much To My Surprise ... It Actually Worked . I Got It ! No , I Got It ! Ignition Sequence Plus Delta " X " Added To " X " Squared . Same Theory As The Fuel-Injection Rocket We Made In Seventh Grade . Oh ! Are You Really Sure You Figured It Out ? This Is Amazing . Are You Sure It 'll Work ? Well , We Did Send A Hamster Soaring Over A Minimarket Using This Equation . It Couldn 't Be That Different . It 's All Set . Just Push " Enter . " Transmission Code Loaded . Press " Enter . " Wait Up ! Wa-Wait . Are You Guys Sure About This ? Eddie , Nothing In Science Is Sure . That 's What Makes It Interesting . Specimen Ready For Time Retrieval . All Right . 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ... Time 's Arrow Machine Engaged . Prepare For Departure . Passage Through Time . Resident Location Annulled . Oh , No , Eddie . You Poofed Them . Me ? All I Did Was Push " Enter . " What Are We Gonna Do Now ? Ok . Ok , Maybe If We Enter All Those Numbers Again , Maybe They 'll Come Back Or Something . Are You Kidding ? If They Couldn 't Make It , Well , We 're Not Going To . Ok , When I Make Mistakes On My Homework , I Just Push " Undo . " Eddie , This Isn 't Homework . This Is A Complicated Scientific- - Resident Location . Discus Shutting Down . Mom ! Dad ! Ignition Sequence Plus Delta " X " Added To " X " Squared . Same Theory As The Fuel-Injection Rocket We Made In Seventh Grade . Are You Guys Ok ? Well , We Did Send A Hamster Soaring Over A Minimarket Using This Equation . Shouldn 't Be That Different . It 's All Set . Just Push " Enter . " Whoa , Wait ! We Just Did This , And It Didn 't Work . Oh , No . It 's 3 : 00 . My Audition ! What ? ! Eddie , You Can 't Have An Audition Now ! I Know , But- - Forget It , Eddie . Get Rid Of Them . Whoo ! It 's Party Time . Back Off . Back Off . Ok ? Just Give Me One Minute To Talk To Him . Dude , What 's With The Door-Slam Drama ? Got Anything To Drink ? Hey , You Said I Was Having An Audition , Not A Rave ! What Is Everyone Doing Out There ? We Didn 't Invite Them . Who Did ? How Should I Know ? But It Looks Like It 's Gonna Be A Rockin ' Party , Man . The Purdy Twins Have Got A Couple Of Cases Of Root Beer . Help Yourself . Amber 's Hauling In Humongous Bags Of Popcorn . Wow ! As Thrilling As That Sounds , Colin , We Are Not Having A Party Here ! What Are All These People Doing Here ? It Sounds Like There 's A Million Kids Outside . Oh , No Worries . I Only Counted 132 . Hey , Marie , You 're Looking Pretty Pretty Today . Eddie , What Are All These People Doing Here ? You Tell Me , And Then We 'll Both Know . Where Should We Be Setting Up All The Equipment ? Uh , Backyard . You Can Use The Patio For Our Stage . Uh , No . No . No Stage , No Band , No Equipment , No 132 Crashers , No Party . Look , Tell Him . I Just Live Here . Maybe You Should Think About Getting A Little Warmup , Dude . And I 'll Be Saving A Spot For You Right Up Front . Kids , Chanting : Party ! Party ! Party ! Am I Losing My Mind , Or Was He Just Flirting With You ? Both . If Only That Stupid Time Machine Was Working , I 'd Be Sending Myself Back To Last Week . You Know- - Wow . What A Rush . Well , We Figured Out The Problem . It Definitely Has To Do With The Machine . You Ok ? Yeah , I 'm Good . Â ™ ª I Don 't Remember You In Class Last Week â ™ ª â ™ ª And You 're The One That Had To Feel This Way â ™ ª I Think We Should Compare What 's In The Design Drawings To What Actually Made It Into The Machine And See If They Match Up . Cool . Go For It . Great . Norton ... Norton ! Pay Attention , Please ! Hello ? Is Anyone Down Here ? Um , This Is , Like , A Really Bad Idea , Coming Down Here Right Now , So ... Let 's Just Go Back To The Party . Ok ? I Can 't Have This Party Going On Today . It 's A Disaster . Why Not ? Cloe Gave Us The Exciting Scoop . Aren 't You Dying ? What Are You Talking About ? You And Colin . Cloe Says That He Likes You , And You Like Him . It 's So Cool . Where 'd She Get That Idea ? From Your Mother . I Knew It . I Knew It . You Don 't Like Him ? Too Bad . He Acted All Pumped When He Found Out . He Was ? Ok . No . I Cannot Deal With This Right Now . We 're Down To Less Than 3 Hours Until Poof Point . What Point ? Oh , Forget It . So , Uh , On This One , We Want You To Sort Of Play Along , Get Yourself Into It , And Then We 'll Set You Up For A Bass Solo , And , Uh , We 'll Give You A Chance To Show Us What You 've Got . Sound Cool ? I Guess . All Right , Ready , Guys ? You Guys Ready To Rock ? All Right . Let 's Do It . Â ™ ª Woke Up With That Empty Feeling â ™ ª â ™ ª In My Head â ™ ª This Is Clear And Utter Defiance . I Warned Marie About Her Parents , And What Does She Do ? She Throws A Huge Party . Those Ballards Are All Alike- - Not One Iota Of Respect For Others . Should We Go Over There ? I Think We Should Call The Police . All I Can Say Is That I 'm Very Glad That Our Lizzie Isn 't The Type Of Child Who Would Ever Even Want To Be A Part Of Such Blatant Hooliganism ! Ooh ! Norton , What Are You Doing ? You Have To Concentrate . What 's The Point ? It 's Not Like We 're Getting Anywhere . I Want To Be Up With The Other Kids . I Want To Party ! Whoo ! Ha Ha ! No , See , First Of All , There Wasn 't Supposed To Be A Stupid Party . Well , Why Are You Acting Like It 's My Fault ? Because You Were The One Who Told Cloe To Organize It . Oh , No , I Didn 't . Does It Really Matter ? Look , They 're Here , They Don 't Want To Leave , And ... We 're Running Out Of Time . That 's All The Reason We Should Be Partying ! Oh , So You 're Gonna Give Up ? Like We Got A Choice . You Do . You Have To ! Hold On . Look , Nobody Panic . Nobody Leave . I Got To Go Get Eddie . Hey , Marie ... Lizzie ! You Know , You Act Like You 're Some Big Friend Of Mine , And Then You Go Throw Some Huge Party And Don 't Even Bother To Invite Me . Look , There Wasn 't Even Supposed To Be A Stupid Party . It Was My Mother 's Idea . Your Mom 's ? Look , If You 're Gonna Blow Me Off , You Can At Least Come Up With A Better Lie . Look , Can We Deal With This Later ? 'Cause I Really Need To Go Talk To Eddie . And Besides , I Happen To Be Telling You The Truth . Really ? That 's So Cool . My Parents Would Never Let Me Have A Party . They 'd Be Too Afraid Someone Might Mess Up Their Perfect House Or Ruin Their Perfect Lawn . Do You Know How Sick To Death I Am Of Trying To Be Perfect ? ! Let Me Guess . Really Sick ? So Sick , There Isn 't A Doctor On The Planet That Could Cure Me . Well , Look , If You Want To Go To The Party , I Mean , You Can . Really ? Thanks . Marie , Norton Did It ! He Found A Part That 's Supposed To Be In The Machine , And It 's Not . It 's Described In Detail In The Notes . There 's Even A Scale Drawing , But It 's Not In The Machine . Yeah ! So , Do You Think That 's What Set Off The Whole De-Aging Deal In The First Place ? Maybe . All We Have To Do Is Find The Missing Piece , Put It In Its Place , Re-Enter The Equations , And Then We- - And What ? More Hiccups . And You Know What That Means . Marigold , What Was He Gonna Tell Us ? What Was He Trying To Say ? He Just Wants Us To- - Oh , No . Mom ! Not--Not You , Too . Mom , No . Wow . Trippin ' . Ok , Uh , Get Back To The Lab , You Guys . Come On . Both Of You . Now . Come On . And I 'm Gonna- - I Got To Go Get Eddie . Gotta Say , Ballard , That Actually Didn 't Reek . Uh , Eddie--House- - Disaster--More- - Need Me To Get You A Glass Of Water ? No , Uh ... I Need You To Come To The Lab , Eddie . Marie , Give Me 5 Or 10 More Minutes . It 's An Emergency . Is This How It 's Gonna Be When We Let You Into The Band ? Every Day , Another Emergency ? No ! Ha Ha ! You See , Trust Me . Um , See , This Emergency Only Can Happen Once . Eddie Is Totally Dependable . He Is Also A Great Musician . Gee , Marie . Thanks . Beep-Beep , Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep ! Whee ! Whee ! Rrrrrr ... Nothing Ruins A Party More Than Having 27-Year-Olds Run Amuck , Especially When They 're Your Parents . What Is It Doing ? Oh , My Gosh ! Excellent . Whoa ! My Turn ! My Turn ! No ! Not In The House ! I Just Want You To Know Your Mother Is My Total Role Model . Cut It Out ! You Are Gonna Be In So ... Much ... Trouble ! Hey , You 're Not The Boss Of Me ! I Don 't Even Know You ! Everybody Out Of My Way ! Uhh ! Ha Ha Ha Ha ! Whoo Hoo Hoo Hoo ! Unh ! Oh , Finally . Ooh , You Killed It . Ooh , I 'm Gonna Tell On You . Wha--What ? We Were Only Making Just A Little Fun . I Think We 've Had Enough Fun . Let 's Go . No ! I Don 't Want To ! Move ! No ! No ! Me Want To Stay Here With The Big Kids . You Ain 't Staying Here , Marigold . Stranger Danger ! Stranger Danger ! We Don 't Even Know You . We 're Your- - Your Baby-Sitters . Uh-Uh . Uh-Uh , 'Cause I 'm 7 , And We Don 't Need No Dumb Baby-Sitter . Dumb , Dumb , Dumb- - Look , If You Two Don 't Behave , We 're Gonna Make Sure We Give Your Parents A Really Bad Report . Yeah , We Can Do It , Too . We 'll Make Absolutely Sure That They Punish You . Come On . No ! No ! Aah ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Get Goin ' ! Go ! Ow ! Ow ! We 'll Tell Them To Take Away Your Tv Privileges For A Month . I Don 't Care . I Don 't Even Watch Tv . Mmm . ' Cause Tv Is For Dummies . Ooh , You 're Mean . We 'll Tell Your Parents Not To Allow You To Read . What ? You Can 't Do That , 'Cause I Love To Read . I Love To Read More Than You Do . Do Not . I Do Too , And Don 't Push Me ! Do Not . He Touched Me . Knock It Off ! Look , If You Two Don 't Want A Bad Report , You 're Gonna Go Upstairs With Eddie , And I 'll Be Right There . What Am I Supposed To Do With Them ? Amuse Them , Eddie . I Gotta Go Shut Down The Party . People , People , Now , Steps Have Already Been Set In Motion To Get The Ballards Evicted From This Neighborhood , And Unless You Want These Officers To Notify Your Parents About Where You 've Been And What You 've Been Up To , You Will Leave Here Immediately . Marie , I Must Say I Am Very Disappointed In You . Now , Hold On , Corkster . I Don 't Think It 's Fair For Us To Blame Marie . I Mean , When You Grow Up With Parents Who Are Too Preoccupied To Ever Set Limits , How Can You Not Expect The Children To Spin Out Of Control ? That 's Why You 'd Never Catch Our Lizzie At A Party Like This . Whatever . Mom ... I 'm Right Here . Now , Wait . Before You Get All Mean And Judgmental , Can I Just Say One Thing ? The Ballards May Be A Little Strange , But They 're Also Incredibly Wonderful . Stuff Happens Around Here For No Apparent Reason , And It 's So Cool . This Whole Party Was Mrs. Ballard 's Idea . You Guys Won 't Even Let Me Have Friends Over For Milk And Cookies . This Only Serves To Confirm My Worst Suspicions . The Ballards Are A Dangerous Influence Who Should Be Removed From Our Neighborhood . Officers , I Want You To Arrest These People At Once . Mom , Just In Case You Haven 't Noticed , Spontaneity Isn 't A Crime . Besides , If You Do Get Them Evicted , Don 't Ever Expect To Speak To Me Again . Whoo ! All Right . All Right . No Need To Ignite World War Iii Here . Now , You Call This Party To A Halt , And We Will Consider- - Consider Giving Your Family One More Chance . Ahh . Gladly . Well , You Heard The Man . Party 's Over . Bummer . Get--Get ... You Guys , Pay Attention ! W-Why Should I ? I Don 't Wanna Find Some Dumb Missing Part . I Wanna Ride On The Spaceship . Norton , How Many Times Do I Have To Tell You ? You Can 't Go For A Ride In The Spaceship Until You Find The Missing Part . Find It , And You Can Go For A Ride . For Real ? Me , Too . I Wanna Go . You 're So Dumb , Marigoldlocks . Girls Can 't Go In The Spaceship . Yes , We Can , Too . Can Not . Better Than Boys . Can Not . We Can Go Better Than Boys . Yes , We Can . Can Not . Can Not . You 're Scared To Go . Right . Mmm . Oh . C-Cool It ! Whoever Finds The Missing Part First Gets The First Ride In The Spaceship . Me First ! I 'm First ! I 'm First ! That 's Me ! I Got It ! Unh . Eh . Pfft . Ah . Pfft . Eddie ? Anything ? Nothing . Where 's Mom And Dad ? Still Looking . Caution . 15 Minutes To Poof Point . Caution . 15 Minutes To Poof Point . We 're Doomed , Aren 't We ? How Can This Be Happening , Eddie ? If They Poof This Time ... It 's Gonna Be For Real . You Know What 's Really Amazing Going Through All This ? Who In The World Would Have Ever Thought That Our Parents ... Are Actually ... Like Us . Quick ! What The ? I Want My Bottle ! Marigold , How Old Are You ? This Many . Oh , No . Norty ? Are You In There ? Oh . Norty Make A Mess . So , This Is Where You Came In . Now You Can See , With Minutes Left Until Poof Point , We Were Desperate ... But How Could We Save Our Parents Without The Vector Modulator ? Sit . Here 's Your Treats . I Want Purple ! Red 's Better . I Got Purple . What 's Goin ' On ? All Right . The Whole Time I Was Looking For The Vector Modulator , I Was Thinking ... Even If We Find It , What If That 's Not The Only Problem ? And Then , I Remembered What Mom Said About How They Originally Calculated Their Formulas , And Then- - Promise Not To Tell Any Of My Friends- - I Actually Started To Think Like A Scientist . No Way . I Know . So , What Did You Figure Out ? This Whole Density And Mass Stuff , It Wasn 't Based On Mom And Dad 's Weight . It Was Based On The Weight Of The Goldfish . Oh , No ! Is That Bad ? It 's Gotta Be . I 'm Betting We 're Gonna Have To Redo All The Math , Or We 'll Never Get ' Em Back . Ok , You Stay Here And Keep Workin ' , And I 'll Go Get The Bathroom Scale . Oh , Doggie ! Oh , Doggie ? Oh , Look At You . Look At Doggie . Oh , Hi , Doggie . Hi , Doggie . Doggie , Doggie , Doggie . Einstein Waited His Whole Life For Dad 's Attention ... Oh , Nice Doggie . And When He Finally Got It ... He Gave Dad A Special Treat . Doggie Wanna Play Ball ? It 's My Ball ! No , It 's My Ball . It 's Mine ! No , It 's My Ball ! It 's Mine ! No , It 's Not ! It 's Mine ! Gimme ! It 's Not ! It 's Not ! Marie , Look ! Stop ! That 's Not Nice ! My Ball ! The Vector Modulator . They 're Gonna Break It ! Quick , Grab It ! Aah ! No ! Yay ! Nice Doggie ! Yay !

Uh-Huh . Can 't You Hold It ? Mm-Mmm . Oh , This Is Just Great . Man , We Don 't Even Know If He 's Toilet-Trained . Norton , Do You Know How To Use The Big Boy Potty ? Mm-Mmm . Oh , Since We 're Way Close To Poof Point , I 'm Gonna Go With The Theory That There 's A First Time For Everything . Get The Machine Fired Up . We 'll Be Right Back . Come On , Norton . Bye-Bye . Begin Initial Countdown Sequence . Final Countdown To Poof Point 2 Minutes , 35 ... How You Doin' In There , Big Boy ? You Almost Done ? Man , What 's Takin' Him So Long ? How Am I Supposed To Know ? Well , Didn 't You Tell Him To Hurry ? You Can 't Rush Someone Doing Their Business , Eddie . You 'll Traumatize Him For Life . Well , If We Don 't Get Him Out In 2 Minutes , He Won 't Have A Life . Come On , Norton ! Let 's Go ! Norton Make A Pee-Pee ! Hallelujah ! 1 : 40 ... Wanna See ? Oh , No . Let 's Go . Norton ! Norton ! I Want A Space Ride ! Hurry Up ! Space Ride !

Well , Just Think About It . I Mean , Doesn 't It Seem Like Only Yesterday That We Were 14 ? Yesterday ? Let 's Try This Morning . Since All This Happened , We 've Been Doing A Lot More Things Together As A Family- - Average Things Like Having Barbecues ... What You Got ? Playing Music ... And Taking Trips . We Just Returned From A Little Time Traveling Back To 1975 , Where I Got To Play Bass With Bob Marley And The Wailers . Now , That 's Smooth And Cool . Peace , Mon .

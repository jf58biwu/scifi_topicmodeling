 Planning a vacation , Mr. Sullivan ? - No . No , just some reading to pass the time . Step ahead , Mr. Sullivan . You ´ re expected in Room 102 . Down the hall and to the right . - Thank you . What is your name ? - Morgan Sullivan . Where were you born ? - Madison , Wisconsin . Are you a spy ? - No . Are you working for Sunways Systems ? - No . Were you paid by Sunways Systems to steal data from digicorp Technologies ? No . Have you ever worked at Sunways Systems ? - No . This is a technology firm , Mr. Sullivan . If we choose you as an agent of Digicorp , you will spy on other corporations , inform us of their business plans , research programs , and counter-intelligence operations . Thus far , your determination has been very impressive . If there is anything more I can tell you about myself , anything that has not already been checked by digicorp ... Your personnel records are fine . You ´ ve passed our neuro-graph five times . I ´ ll take the test again if you like . - You ´ ve been married four years . You live in a respectable neighborhood . You ´ ve always had stable jobs . You have an excellent credit history . No drug habits . No drinking problems . You don ´ t smoke . No other vices to speak of . is there anything else we should know about you ? Well , it might have taken me quite a while to get to this point , Mr. Finster , but now that I ´ m here , I ´ m going to make the most of it . This is who I am . And this is what I want to do . The stakes in this job are very high . - Yes , I understand . It will be like nothing you ever did before . - Oh , I ´ m prepared for that . You will be sent to conventions across the country . You will record the speeches . That ´ s been made very clear . - You ´ ll have to deceive other people about what you do for a living . Even your wife . - Yes . Yes . You don ´ t mind lying to your wife ? No ... no I don ´ t mind . That was a good one . Move on ahead to the next station . Hello , Mr. Sullivan . - Hello . Keep it out of view until the convention speeches actually start . You see the flash ? It ´ s now on . Press it again . It ´ s now off . Easy , isn ´ t it ? - And the transmissions are really clear ? Within fifty yards . - Where do the signals go ? Up to our satellite systems , then back down to our data banks . I guess the speeches must be pretty important . The speeches are not your concern , Mr. Sullivan . Just do your job . Follow our instructions . Nothing else . Do you understand ? Yes , Mr. Finster ... - Ready ! Jack Thursby ? - That ´ s what you ´ ll be called from now on . Morgan Sullivan doesn ´ t exist for digicorp . We ´ ve never met him . We never will . - What ´ s he like ? Pardon ? What ´ s his personality ? He ´ s whoever you want him to be . Buffalo ? Why do they need you to go all the way to Buffalo ? They want me to tutor them on that spread sheet software I was using at my last job . And you ´ ll be paid freelance for this ? - Sure. independent contractor . If things work out , there could be more trips down the road . I thought we agreed you weren ´ t going back to work yet . Not until that position at my father ´ s firm opened up . - l can do this in the meantime , can ´ t l ? I really need you at home right now . I ´ m so busy with the Williams case . It ´ s only temporary , honey . I won ´ t be gone for long . Hello ? After the convention , you will confirm the transmission on your returning flight . You know the location of the briefcase ? - Yes . Good luck . We ´ re counting on you . - Thank you . I left it in the stall . Something to drink , sir ? I ´ ll have a ginger ale . Actually , I ´ ll have a scotch . - Scotch ? Single Malt . On the rocks . - Yes , sir . Welcome to Buffalo , Mr. Thursby . This is our new mascara line . It ´ s hyper allergenic . And it ´ s vitamin enriched ... - Really ? Mr ... Fred Garfield . Jack Thursby . - Fairway Fragrances . Where are they located exactly ? - Tulsa . Tulsa , Oklahoma . You don ´ t say ? I ´ ve got family from Tulsa . You don ´ t have much of an accent . I didn ´ t grow up there . - Oh . Where did you grow up ? I said where ´ d you grow up ? - The South Pacific . I ´ m sorry , where ? - The South Pacific Islands . The Tuamotu Archipelago . French Polynesia . Tahiti . Papeete . Wow , that ´ s pretty unusual . - Yeah , I plan to go back there someday . When I retire . - Water , sir ? Thanks . - Well , see you around , Jack . Sure thing , Fred . The conference room will be open in five minutes . Good morning , my name is Robert Tuttle , I ´ ll be your first speaker. I ´ ll first ... discuss shaving cream distribution outlets in North American markets . Let me begin ... by acknowledging what has become axiomatic in the field of shaving cream distribution . Mainly that shaving cream , indeed almost all personal hygiene products for men are what we call fashion resistant . The overwhelming majority of shaving cream users adopt a brand and remain loyal to it . Interesting to note is the difference in methods used to penetrate that market . Because these two methods employed by the respective companies really illustrates the essential strategic choice that faces the Mediterranean is beautiful of course , but if it ´ s real sailing you want I recommend the Sunda Islands in the Banda Sea . I was there on a trip last spring , Your cigarettes , sir . - Thank you very much . Cohibas , my favorite brand . Thank you . Oh , I ´ m sorry . - Thank you . Would you excuse me a moment ... Good evening , sir . What ´ ll it be ? Scotch . Single malt . On the rocks . - You got it . Haven ´ t we seen each other before ? You ´ ll have to come up with something more original than that . I ´ m here for the convention . That ´ s fascinating . You ´ re in marketing , right ? Sales . - Sales. ls there a difference ? What about you ? I do health inspections of hotel restaurants . That sounds interesting . - No it doesn ´ t . Do you have an answer for everything ? Yes . Rita Foster . Jack Thursby . So what do you do besides travel to dull cities and talk to women in hotel bars ? I play golf . - Are you any good ? No . Honesty. I like that . - What else do you like ? No commitments . No bullshit . And no rings . - No rings ? You might want to take yours off . I ´ m sorry . I ´ ll leave you alone now . Your transmission came through , Mr. Thursby . The signal was clear . I could do something else on my next trip . I ´ m ready to handle a bigger assignment . We ´ ll send you to Omaha next Wednesday . - Omaha ? You ´ ll perform the same job that you did in Buffalo . Omaha ? Why can ´ t they find someone in Omaha ? Why do they need to fly you all the way out there ? It doesn ´ t make sense . Morgan ! Morgan . Are you listening to me ? Since when did you ever care about golf ? . You ´ re not going on this trip , Morgan . I ´ m sorry . What do you mean , I ´ m not going ? - My father wants you ... to come to his office tomorrow . Getting a position with his company is ... more important than a silly freelance job . - l said , I ´ d go . You ´ re not going , Morgan . End of discussion . You ´ re staying here . I ´ ll call my father tonight and we ´ ll ... Tell your father to go fuck himself . What did you just say ? Say you ´ re sorry , Morgan ! Morgan ! If you don ´ t apologize , I want you out of this house ! Morgan ! Are you listening to me ? What in God ´ s name has gotten in to you ? Since when did you start smoking ? Morgan , what ´ s going on ? I think I deserve an explanation . Your scotch , Mr. Thursby . Do you like another Gin Tonic ? Turn around slowly , please . What is your transmission device ? - l thought you were a health inspector . I ´ ll ask you again ... What is your transmission device ? Then pen ... in my jacket pocket . Do not turn the pen on . - What ? Keep it off inside the convention room . Do not send the transmission to digicorp . If you tell digicorp you met me , they ´ ll kill you . Take two every six hours. lt will get rid of the nightmares you ´ ve been having . Your headaches will go away too . And the pain in the back of your neck . How do you know that I ´ m having nightmares ? - We ´ ll be in touch in Boise . What will they do if I don ´ t turn on my pen ? - Just remember who you are . You are Morgan Sullivan . You are not Jack Thursby . Wait ! God morning everyone , I ´ m Alex Chen . I ´ ll be your first speaker . I ´ m here to address the controversy that ´ s been raging around new techniques in the preparation of process cheese . Now at the risk of oversimplifying , the question facing the average manufacturer of process cheese is : Given an increased ... consumer prejudice against chemical additives , how do we stem the tide away from natural or organic based products and instil in the cheese buyer ... I ´ m glad to hear that there were no problems at the convention , Mr. Thursby . I ´ ll call down to the lab to make sure the transmission went through . Excellent work , Mr. Thursby . Thank you . Your transmission came through perfectly . Just as clear as the last time . I want you to take another trip . Boise , Idaho . Boise ? We scheduled a connecting flight for you . You won ´ t have time to go home . That ´ s not a problem , is it ? - No . No problem . Room 1 493 , Mr. Thursby . The convention room will be open in an hour . Thanks . Mr. Thursby ... One last thing . The first letter from each word is the phone number to call her . Hello , Mr. Sullivan . You dialed a special number that can ´ t be traced or monitored . Listen carefully . Take the service elevator at the end of the hall down to the basement . You ´ ll be clear for the next five minutes . - Wait a minute , wait ! Keep moving . Roll up your sleeve , please . We don ´ t have much time . Are you insane ! You ´ re not sticking that into me . He has medical training , Mr. Sullivan . - l don ´ t care if he ´ s a brain surgeon ! I won ´ t let you people drug me . - We ´ re undrugging you . The shot blocks out the digicorp narcotic they ´ re putting in your bloodstream ... at every convention . Do you normally drink something inside the convention room ? Mineral water . - The narcotic is tasteless and odorless . You wouldn ´ t have known . Did you take the pills I gave you ? Have the noises in your head started to go away ? And the recurring dreams ? Jesus , what is this ? Why didn ´ t digicorp check my transmission in Omaha ? There was no transmission in Omaha . Or in Buffalo . Or anywhere else . Why do they send me to these conventions ? - The conventions are charades . Charades ? - You and the other convention guests ... all work for digicorp . You ´ re all spies . You ´ re given ... phony assignments , phony identities . You think your pen is a transmitting device . Others think it ´ s his tie clip or her watch . It ´ s just a ploy to keep you all distracted . To not realize what ´ s really going on . What is really going on ? If you want answers , take the shot . Act as you always act inside the room . Order the mineral water . Drink it . Don ´ t make them suspicious . The shot we gave you should protect you . It should protect ? What if it doesn ´ t ? Listen to me carefully . Whatever happens in that room , show no reaction , no emotion , no surprise . No matter what you see , do not move . What will I see ? Who sent you ? - A friend . I don ´ t have any friends . When will I see you again ? - Soon . I promise . There are several points of interest here . First of all , the fact , that by an impressive margin , new home purchases ... took most of the brunt of that decline . By this I mean ... that sales of older homes are done on an individual basis where there ´ s considerably more room for negotiation . Therefore , in those sales we ´ re more likely to find that the official rise ... in mortgage rates has been offset somewhat by the ... rates of return on high tech investments , which led to a surge ... in business capital spending , and significantly increased ... the underlying growth rate of productivity . The capitalization of these ... higher than expected returns boosted equity prices generally ... beyond even that expected by the enhanced rise in real incomes . The elevated level of light vehicle sales , for example , has put more vehicles on the road than the industry could sustain . And even though demand for the number of high tech products ... was doubling or tripling annually , in many cases new supply was coming on even faster . Overall capacity in high tech manufacturing industries ... rose nearly 50 percent last year . Well in excess of its rapid rate of increase . Accordingly the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of last year ... intensified , perhaps even to the point of growth stalling out ... around the turn of the year . As the economy slowed , equity prices fell , especially in the high tech sector , where previous high evaluations were being reevaluated , resulting in significant losses in some investors . Clearly some slowing in the pace of spending was necessary ... if the economy was to progress along balanced and sustainable growth . With the process likely to intensify with the rise in the cost of energy that has strained business and household purchasing power . Purchases of durable goods and investment in capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter . Because the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses , it induced some backup in inventories , despite more advance in recent years that enabled firms ... to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in demand . Inventory sales ratios rose only moderately . And even after the policy actions taken in January , the risks continue skewed toward the economies remaining on a path inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance . Crucuial to the assessment of the outlook and the understanding of recent ... policy options , is the role of the technological change in productivity in shaping near-term transcyclical forces ... as well as long term sustainable growth . Perceptible for sustaining slow advances in quality . Moreover , although recent short term business profits softened considerably , most corporate managers appear not to have altered their appreciable extent ... through any of the long standing optimism about the future returns . A recent survey of purchasing managers ... Just a reflex . ... suggests that the wave of new online business activities was far from impressive . Managers appear to be more generally sanguine about the potential for innovation . You are not Morgan Sullivan ! You are Jack Thursby . You are not married to Amy Sullivan . Your wife is Diane Thursby . San José is not your home . You live in Redmond , Washington . ... expressed concern over current declines in market interest rates . The FOMC reduced its target of federal funds by one half percent . Though it ´ s current rate is five and a half percent . Accordingly to foster financial conditions , the federal reserve has quickened the pace of adjustment for its policy . And in conclusion , a cautious approach ... is always the best strategy . Thank you for your attention . Excuse me , do you have the time ? The time ? Your watch ... Yeah , it ´ s three-thirty . - Already ? Gosh , the last speech just flew by . Did you enjoy it ? Oh yeah , very much . Hello ? It ´ s for you . DigiCorp will approach you at the airport . Tell them you are Jack Thursby . You ´ ve never heard of Morgan Sullivan . Make them think you ´ re brainwashed . If you ´ re exposed , they ´ ll kill you . - What happened back there ? That ´ s the neutralizing agent in your system . Don ´ t worry . You ´ ll be fine . Mr. Sullivan ... There ´ s been a change of plans . You need to come to digicorp ´ s local office right away . Mr. Sullivan ? Mr. Sullivan ? Are you alright ? I think you ´ re mistaken . My name isn ´ t Sullivan . You ´ re not Morgan Sullivan ? You don ´ t work for digicorp ? No . My name is Thursby . Jack Thursby . I think you ´ re looking for somebody else . I ´ m sorry , Mr. Thursby . My mistake . That ´ s okay . Hello , sir . How are you ? I just need to see your boarding pass , please . Thank you . Thank you . - You ´ re welcome . Excuse me . - No problem . Your turn . There ´ s not much hot water left . Sorry . Could you make dinner a half hour earlier tonight ? - Sure . I wrote down a list of errands I need you to do today . - Okay . Your car keys are in the foyer next to your briefcase . Right where you left them . Planning a trip ? - Just some reading to pass the time . You ´ re expected in reception , Mr. Thursby . Down the hall and to the left . What is your name ? - Jack Thursby . My name ´ s Frank Callaway . I ´ m head of security for Sunways Systems . According to your neuro-graph , you ´ re lying . You ´ re lying when you say that your name is Jack Thursby . You ´ re lying when you say that you are not an undercover agent . You are lying when you say that you do not work for digicorp . And I can ´ t tell you how happy that makes us . No way ... I am not going back to that house . You are in a unique position here , Morgan . DigiCorp thinks that you ´ re brainwashed ... as Jack Thursby . They think that you passed our neuro-graph and they want us ... to hire you as one of our agents . - l don ´ t care what they want . Your counter intelligence work for Sunways will be very simple . DigiCorp will ... never suspect that you ´ re working for us . So they won ´ t watch you too closely ... while you ´ re in the house . You only have to place one bug in each room . You don ´ t fucking understand . I ´ m going home. I ´ m going to my real home . Your real home is gone , Morgan . - What ? Your wife put your house up for sale . Her lawyer has been trying ... to contact you the last few days . She filed for divorce three days ago . I ´ m sorry , Morgan . Look , Morgan , I know this is hard . - l want to see Rita . Who ? - Rita Foster . She pulled me out of the brainwashing . - No , Morgan , you cannot see her . Why not ? She works for you . - She does not work for us . But you sent her to find me at the hotels . - No . But you know who she works for ? Who does she work for ? She works for Sebastian Rooks . - Who ´ s Sebastian Rooks ? Sebastian Rooks is a freelance operative who we hired to find out how digicorp ... was getting their agents past our neuro-graph . Then we asked him ... to send us an agent who wasn ´ t brainwashed . He delivered you . He ´ s the best in the business , but he ´ s also very dangerous , and very ruthless . I advise you to stay away from him . Stay away from him ... and her . Look ... We are offering you a very good deal here . When your work for us is finished we ´ ll give you a new identity , and a new home , somewhere very far away ... and safe from digicorp . - l ´ m sorry , Mr. Callaway , but you ´ ll have to find someone else for your job . You won ´ t last long out there . Anywhere you go outside this complex , DigiCorp will have agents watching you . If you try to run , if you behave like Morgan Sullivan ... instead of Jack Thursby , they will eliminate you . Quick . Efficient . Ruthless . You ´ re fortunate , Morgan. lf we hadn ´ t interrupted the brainwashing process , you ´ d be like the other convention guests : programmed with a new identity and sent ... to companies across the globe , disposed of when you ´ re no more useful to digicorp . You have a chance to fight back . So , are you ready to be a spy , Morgan ? I ´ m gonna get some more broccoli . Phone lines are tapped . We ´ ve got visual in all the rooms . There they are. ln the dining room . The salt shaker gives a nice angle , doesn ´ t it ? Very well , he believes he ´ s Jack Thursby . He ´ s adjusted to this house . Who ´ s she talking to ? - digicorp agents . She ´ s giving them a report on you . He spends much of his time indoors . He has no friends ... We ´ ve got the internet lines tapped too . Excellent work , Morgan . Excellent . My God . My life is the same as it ever was . That ´ s because digicorp monitored your old life and then duplicated it . It helps ease the transition of becoming another person . That ´ s not who I am anymore . I ... I smoke cigarettes , I like to drink scotch . Play golf . I ´ m not supposed to live in the suburbs . I ´ m not supposed to be like that . I ´ m sorry if you ´ re disappointed , Morgan , That is your vision of Jack Thursby . It ´ s not digicorp ´ s . Can you guys clean up the camera reception in the hallway ? Yes , Jamison ? This isn ´ t Jamison . It ´ s Morgan Sullivan . Bitch ... What do you want , Mr. Sullivan ? - l need your help . I want to hire Sebastian Rooks . Are you still there ? I ´ ll pay him for his services . He doesn ´ t work for individuals . - Ask him to make an exception . I ´ ll do whatever it takes . - You ´ re on your own , I ´ m sorry . Listen , you gotta help me . There ´ s nothing I can ... - Please . You said I could trust you . I believed you when you said that . Meet me at the carwash at Fourth and Jefferson in three hours . Morgan ? We ´ ll be sending you on your first assignment next week . Our surveillance of your house has already paid off . We know exactly ... what kind of data digicorp is trying to steal from us . Tonight , you ´ ll say ... that you ´ re going on a business trip . You know how to tell her that , right ? Morgan ? - Yes . You will stick to the script , Morgan . Don ´ t try anything risky. ls that clear ? Sebastian Rooks has agreed to help you . - When does he want to meet me ? Not yet . He ´ s in the car behind us . How much money does Rooks want ? - He ´ s not interested in your money . It ´ s your situation . He thinks , he can use it to his advantage . - How ? I ´ ll be in touch with you in Wichita . - Wichita ? You ´ ll do your last job for Sunways there . - How do you know that ? They haven ´ t even told me . - Rooks knows . He knows everything . Can I trust Rooks ? - l can ´ t give you guarantees . But he has the resources to provide you with a new life , a new identity . It ´ s your choice , Mr. Sullivan . What do I have to do ? Sunways will send you on a series of assignments . You ´ ll receive a courier disk on each trip . DigiCorp agents ... will be following you wherever you go . Let them . That ´ s what Sunways wants . At each destination you ´ ll be met by a Sunways contact . They ´ ll download data onto your disk . DigiCorp ´ s agents will assume you ´ re receiving valuable information . As you travel to more cities , collect more data , and complete more assignments , your agent status will rise . DigiCorp will then assume you have become one of Sunways top company men . Jack ? Each disk you bring home will seem more important than the last . As they copy the files , Digicorp will think they have won a major victory ... against their greatest rival . In reality , digicorp is the loser . Sunways is feeding them corrupt data that will sabotage their operations . But make no mistake , Mr. Sullivan . Sunways is just ... as ruthless as digicorp . Once this operation is complete , they will eliminate you . Rooks will protect you . Please . You can trust me . We ´ re sending you to Kansas . Wichita . It ´ s almost over , Morgan . After this trip to the vault your work for us will be finished . The vault ? - lt ´ s our data warehouse . But we send in agent couriers , if we need to retrieve or add a file . You will be our next courier . And digicorp will think , they have hit the motherlode . Shh ! We have to keep our voices down . Switch this disk ... with the one in your briefcase . Before you go to the vault . Take off your ring . - What ? Your ring . This is a tracking device . We ´ ll know your precise location at all times . Does this mean we can see each other again ? - l pick you up after you leave the vault , deliver you to Rooks . - l mean , after that . We can never see each other again . It would compromise your identity . I ´ m never getting out of this , am I ? 500 Horse Creek Road , please . I know where to go . Settle down , Mr. Sullivan . We have a long ride ahead of us . You don ´ t have to pretend to be Thursby . I know you ´ re not brainwashed . I know that Sunways has been using you as a double agent against digicorp . Are you going to kill me ? Not if you turn your loyalties to me ... instead of Sebastian Rooks . Oh yeah , I know that you work for him . As a matter of fact we both do . I ´ m Rooks ´ inside source at digicorp . His what ? He paid me to hire you . So you could be his pawn ... once you were sent off to Sunways . You didn ´ t think I hired you because I was impressed by you , did you ? It ´ s a good plan , really . Rooks knew that you ´ d end up here in Kansas ... on the way to the Sunways vault . He knew he could convince you ... to switch their disk with his . That was his scheme from the very start . It ´ s not possible ... Rook ´ s disk contains a search program . It penetrates the vault ´ s secure network ... and quietly steal a data file ... without triggering any alarms . - What data file ? Who knows ? But if Rooks has gone through all this trouble to get it , it must be extremely valuable . The plan was foolproof . Except for one factor he failed to consider ... Me . What do you want ? - Deliver the disk to me , not Rooks . I ´ ve been loyal to digicorp all along . - Why should I trust you , or digicorp ? - Because we ´ ll let you live . Rooks won ´ t . It ´ s as simple as that . No one sees his face and lives to tell about it . No one sees his face ? - Rooks is a deep cover operative . A Yuri in cyberspace . He ´ s a phantom . Companies hire him ... without actually knowing who he is . If they did , they ´ d kill him . The moment you give that disk to Rooks is the moment he eliminates you . There ´ s only one person Rooks trusts with his identity ... Rita Foster . His lover . She ´ s completely loyal to him . No one else . I ´ m the only person you can trust now . I ´ ll be nearby when you come out . Just in case we get separated ... No charge for the ride . Good evening Mr. Thursby . My name ´ s Virgil Dunn . Welcome to the vault . Your first time ? Hope you didn ´ t have a big dinner . Step ahead please . Now that we know you are bug free , I can call you by your real name ... Morgan . Dunn , Virgil C. I need your disk now , please . Good , good . DigiCorp will cream in their pants when they copy the bogus data ... that I just cooked up for them . You wouldn ´ t believe how the number of times they tried to jack into the systems here . - Have they ever succeeded ? Hell , no . This place is tighter than a nun ´ s asshole . A snort while we wait ? Sure . I brew it myself down here . One of my hobbies to pass the time . Thanks . Here ´ s to the information age . I used to be an agent like you once . I was the best mole spotter in the business . You put me in a room with a possible double agent , I ask him some questions , and I could tell you right there whether he was a spy or not . That was before Sunways sent me down here . That was three years ago . What happened ? - Those fucking machines is what happened . They said the neuro-graphs were one hundred percent accurate , but I wasn ´ t . That a really good spy , a really good liar , could trick me every time . It ´ s bullshit , I told them . But they wouldn ´ t listen . You see ... There are things that only a person can know about another person , Mr. Sullivan . Things that a machine could never pick up . For example , let me ask you a couple of questions . - Excuse me ? What is your favorite drink ? Go ahead . Answer. I just want to prove my point . What is your favorite drink ? Scotch . Single Malt . On the rocks . You ´ re telling the truth . Are you married ? - Yes , I am . Truth again . See , you ´ re very ... very easy to read . Now ... Are you in love with your wife ? Yes . There , you just lied . Am I right ? Yes , I lied . It ´ s more than just questions , however . For instance ... I ´ m sensing a kind of tension ... in you . It ´ s been evident ever since I put your disk in my computer . Now why would that be ? We both know the disk is from Sunways . That ´ s nothing that should make you uneasy . One last question . All right ? Sure . Are you a double agent ? Where ´ s Mr. Dunn ? He decided to stay in his office . Right . You can go ahead , Mr. Sullivan . Thank you . Open the door ! Emergency crews are on their way . For your safety , please remain inside the elevator . Emergency crews are on their way . Please remain inside the elevator . Emergency crews are on their way . For your safety , please remain inside the elevator . Jump ! Now ! I told you I ´ d know where you ´ d be . I can take the disk now . is this Rooks ? - Jamison , one of our operatives . Rooks is back at the hotel . He ´ s looking forward to seeing you . The car ´ s waiting downstairs . Call me when you get to the lab . This is where Rooks lives ? - For now . He moves around a lot . - But you know where he is at all times ? We have a special relationship . Your assignment is nearly finished , Mr. Sullivan . I ´ ll be back in a moment . Finster . It ´ s Morgan Sullivan . - Sullivan ! What happened to you ? I ´ m in the penthouse suite of an old building. I don ´ t know where ... We ´ re tracing the call . Where ´ s Rooks ? - l ´ m just about to meet him . Get off the phone before he sees you . He ´ ll kill you ! Hold on to the disk . We ´ re on our way . Don ´ t come any closer . Put the gun down , Mr. Sullivan . - l ´ ll break it . You come any further , I ´ ll break it . I gave you the Sunways disk . This one ´ s yours . The one Rooks wants . Stop ! You really don ´ t want to do that . - You used me . You and Rooks . You used me from the very start . Wait , let me explain ... - No . Finster already explained everything . When did you talk to Finster ? - He ´ s on his way. I just called him . If Rooks wants this before Finster arrives , you better unlock that door and let me go . Listen to me . Sebastian Rooks is not the person you think he is . Sebastian Rooks is a ruthless spy . And so are you . No , you ´ re wrong . He ´ s ... - l know about you . I know about the two of you . I know about your special relationship . Please , just hear me out. i ... - l don ´ t want to hear any more lies . God ! I can ´ t believe I thought , you actually cared about me . I can ´ t believe I was such a fool . - l do care about you . No . No . Just go see Rooks ! It ´ ll be okay . Hurry . Find him . Jack Thursby ! Morgan Sullivan ! Sebastian Rooks ! I tried stopping you . But you insisted . You said it was the only way to steal the data from the vault . Welcome home , Mr. Rooks . Come on . Finster will be here any minute . - No . No more lies . You can ´ t trick me anymore . Listen to me . You are not Morgan Sullivan . You created him out of your own imagination . Your life in the suburbs , your miserable marriage , your wife , Amy , was one of your own operatives playing a part you assigned her . The more you fight the truth , the more it ´ ll hurt . It ´ s not possible ... - You used the same brainwashing technique DigiCorp uses . You were the one who sold the technology to them to begin with . This makes no sense . - lt makes perfect sense ! By turning yourself into Morgan Sullivan you could pass digicorp ´ s neuro-graph . It was the only way you could get hired to be their spy and get sent to Sunways . Why would anyone do this ? - For this . What on it ? I was hoping you could tell me . - You don ´ t know ? I ´ ve put a lot of faith into this assignment . Clear ! - Clear ! Freeze ! Don ´ t move ! - Don ´ t move ! Sunways Security ! Identify yourself ! DigiCorp Security ! You following me , Callaway ? - l ´ m here for Rooks , not you . Me , too ! You ´ ve flown this before ? - No , never . You know how to fly it . You designed it . I don ´ t know what to do ! - Sebastian Rooks knows . I can ´ t remember Sebastian Rooks ! - You remembered that you loved me . Go , go , go ! Just think . We ´ re out . Did you get a look at him ? Did you see Rook ´ s face ? Just Morgan Sullivan . Our pawn . Jesus , he ´ s Rooks . is it what you wanted ? Yes . It ´ s you . The file in the vault was erased . And this is the only copy . Now there ´ s no copy at all .

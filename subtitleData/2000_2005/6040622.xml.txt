 Previously on Farscape ... When I was a kid ... I dreamed ... of outer space . This ship ... is dead ! The wormhole experiment is over . Moya feels Talyn has earned the right to be buried in the sacred space . We all knew the time would come when we 'd split up . - I 'm coming with you . - No . I 'm sorry . Do you love John Crichton ? Do you love Aeryn Sun ? Then don 't make me say good-bye and don 't make me stay . Aeryn ... is ... with child . Pilot . Patch me through to Aeryn . She is beyond our range , Commander . Get a fix on her position . We 're goin after her . Commander ! We 're being drawn in ... . Commander ! You have got to be kidding me . I know I seem a little obsessed lately , but it 's been a long time since you rescued me . Are you hearing any of this ? Pilot , if you 're there ... almost out of fuel . Need a little help . Look , I 'm trying to apologize . I accept my friends aren 't coming back from the wormhole . You 're on a beautiful old ship , and I can 't leave you guys , so please let me back in . Yo ! Your ladyship ! I 'm sorry , Commander . I must have ... dozed off . Faster . Faster . Allegro . Allegro . Now bring in the horns ! There is a store of crylliun alloy ore on tier 7 which might be ... Uh , no , no . My module can 't process it without purification and reduction . Then there 's nothing aboard that can facilitate your escape before we die . So few Leviathans are able to end their physical existence in this sacred space . Elack and I promised each other this when we were joined , over three hundred and fifty cycles ago . I 'm sorry . Well ... it could be worse . You don 't roll in , I 'm dead long time ago . Besides , I 've almost cracked " Wormholes for Dummys " Why would I stick around after that ? Wha ! John . Sorry I didn 't notice it sooner , but there 's a small craft approaching . Commander . It is out of control . Go fetch . If you are sober or sane enough to understand , I suggest you aim that behind you . The creatures following me execute on sight . Now ... What are you going to do for me ? Subtitles : PK SUB-66 This is a dying ship . There shouldn 't be anyone onboard a dying ship . Absolutely correct , Tinkerbell . Okay , my turn . Who , what , when , where , why and how ? You must listen to me . Oh , no . No , no . I 'm no good at listening . My brain cannot tolerate translator microbes . I 'm ... I must learn your language through hearing it . This . The name . The word . Winona . My pulse pistol . More words . They will be here soon , and you will be dead before you see them . Module . Box . Workbench . Junk . More junk . Tools . Bulkhead . Ceiling . Floor . Shirt . Wine . Face . Your alphabet ... in order . God . Haven 't done this in a long time . A , b , c , d , efg . H , i , j , k , lmnop . Q , r , s , t , u , v. W , x , y and z . Now I 've sung my ABC 's ... - Commander ? - ... yah . Hello ! Another vessel approaches . A much larger one . Can she starburst ? You speak pilot ? Yes . Right . Of course you do . Uh ... no . Dying ship , remember ? No starburst ... muerta ... dead ... toast . Make sentences . Nouns , verbs . Okay . Once upon a time , I was happy here . Little ... on the lonely side , but that 's okay cause at least Winona only had to start cooking fires . You know , fire , whoosh , fire . Module 's outta fuel , so it 's not going anywhere . So I 'm workin like a mofo . And everything is finally comin together on these crates here til you ... smash through , pissing me off ... just a little bit . You see , the only thing that I still had going for me , you just destroyed lady . Yeah ! Grudeks will shock the hull , incapacitating most functioning . Damn . Wh ... what about the pilot ? Muerte pilot ? Muerte , muerte pilot ? No pilot morte . No , they need her alive to harvest the toubray tissue . We need an enclosed space ... with self-contained circulation . They are going to fumigate ! Grudeks ... Grudeks . God , I love ' em . Who the hell are they ? Toubray hunters . You got a quick ear . Toubray is Leviathan neural cluster tissue . Many cultures consume it to enhance higher brain function . And you were with ' em ? Til I fled for my life . That 's gonna be your song , you don 't give me an explanation . Bah ! No touchy . The organization I work for was hired to find Leviathans . I was given half a cycle to become an expert on their functions and their habits . Uh , you can cut ' em up into sushi . Why do you think I worked so hard to find the sacred death space ? Cause old Leviathans are easier targets ? And the toubray is richer with age , so the Grudeks are happy . But my reasoning is this Leviathan is near death anyway . Harvesting it is better than killing a healthy creature ... and everyone onboard . So you ... " Jacques Cousteau " your way upstream to where they die . Least you 've thought about it . Your capacity for self-delusionment ... astounds even me ! And I live inside your curdled brain . Hey man . If you don 't like the Baywatch thing ... head inland . How many men have a goal , a challenge , a destiny as clear as yours ? Stay focused on the riddle of the wormholes . Affect the things you can . Satisfy yourself John . Snow cone ? Uhh ... cherry . He 's right , you know . Tell me again . Why did you leave ? You assume that the answer is going to be different from the other thousand times you 've asked the question ? Because is not an answer . I 'm not right for you , John . I was just the best of limited choices . That 's my kid , you know . That 's Crichton 's kid . This is my child . Whatever . Extraction party secure . Breathable atmosphere . Heir to Command , report . Awaiting , Warlord . Scout the region . Identify additional prey . Await my summons . As you command . Good hunting . Five thousand grandars for whoever locates the etal cavity ! And a thousand more for the female corpse ! Come on Pilot , snap to . Come on . Just boost fluid to her hydrex gland . Shhh ! We have bad guys onboard . Can you space ' em ? Elack is still dazed ... and I have virtually no systems at my disposal . I recommend you save yourselves . What about you ? We are old . We must accept our time is soon anyway . Perhaps in passing we can serve some purpose for others . She 's the Mother Theresa of the Uncharted Territories . No . You don 't mind if we fight for you , do ya ? Do you have any DRD 's left with weapons ? Can we negotiate with these guys ? That is not their way . Grudex my ass . Time for a show of force . If we had any . Didn 't get that one , did ' ya , cause it 's Klingon . Time for you guys to clear out ! There is no quarrel with you . Remain clear and you may live . Well no . No , not if you destroy my ship . Flee then . I award safe passage . Hah ! You know what ? Flip that around . You got sixty microts ... It 's a show of force . It 's the only thing that Klingons understand ! Make them think you 're dead . Okay , Sputnik . No . You missed ! Release the Brindz Hound ! Hound ? What 're we talking , tracking dog ? Blood hunter . How big ? What ? ! You see this ? Itty bitty doggie ain 't gonna like it . There should be a pressure hatch here , to a crawl space between ... Hamman side , two tiers up . No , no . Leviathan schematics clearly indicate that there should be a ... . Schematics ? What schematics ? I thought you were an expert . I am . I found the burial space . There should be a hatchway and it should be here . Every Leviathan grows to accomodate its passengers . It 's Pilot 's whim . It 's ... Oh , my goodness ! You 've never been on one before , have you ? You can 't learn Leviathans in the library . Hamman side . All ... right . None of the doors work ? Because it 's a dying ship . Nice puppy . Ok ... Stick with me ... You 'll be O ... O ... kay . Shift your gravity center . Hurry ! Do what ? This is big . Obviously , you need to get out more . Is it torn bad ? No , but it 's the largest vein I 've ever seen . It supplies blood to my leg . It lets me move faster , run away . Obviously it needs to be bigger . It needs to be smaller . Everything smaller ... lighter . Otherwise you 'll never be able to shift your gravity center . I wouldn 't need to shift my damn gravity center if it wasn 't for you . What happened between you and the Grudeks ? Why did you run away ? I don 't think that is anything you need to know . Sputnik ... if we don 't work together , we die . That 's all the need to know , I need to know . I was ... too good . A simple Leviathan travel route was all they expected . By finding the Sacred Burial Space , with mature toubray flesh , I ... I sabotaged myself . Right . They didn 't want you to tell anybody . My loss counts as breach . They won 't even have to pay fees to my organization . Somebody sign that contract ? Kinda makes me wanta kill you myself . I think if you wait , they will do that for you . We climb two levels higher , then begin searching anew . How do you know they 'll come this way ? The lights are still on . The air is still circulating . They have not found the etal cavity yet . The what ? The richest , most prized toubray comes from Leviathan 's very first neural cell . Defleshing it shorts out everything else . 1812 ... gun . This is a very nice profession you 've chosen . Thank you . Conductivity tests indicate upper quadrant . Wardol , this next location brings us much closer . Ambush time . Stay quiet . Crichton ? I know you 're here . Rygel and I are staring at your pimple of a module in this wreck of a maintenance bay . Crichton ? Where 's Moya ? Where are you ? Center chamber as I recall . No exits ! They know we 're here . Oh , nothin gets by you , does it ? Wait ! Sikozu Shanu . Warlord Ilkog . I beg your tolerance and pledge never to tell anyone about this place . Yes certain ... when you are dead . Now I know , that once you had amnesty , you were gonna mention my name . Right ? Grudeks ! Wait ! Your ... earlier offer . The runaway program ... We 'll take it . Grudeks ... when they reach the corner , all fire as one . 1812 ! This way ! If Psycho-zoo led these sledgenaughts aboard , then why are we keeping her alive ? Pip , cut her some slack . She just had her hand ripped off . And you haven 't seen Moya ? I told you , Sparky , she got swallowed . Well , our pod 's not going anywhere . We were lucky to get this far . Chiana ? What the hell 's the matter with you ? With me ? Yah , you . What 's the matter with me ? You . Hey , Ryg , how ' bout you tell Crichton , what 's the matter with me . Why are you shaving now ? You 're what 's the matter with me , Crichton . You ... always ... you . An unprecedented reward is offered for information leading ... dead-or-alive price of five million currency pledges rests on the Nebari ... Chiana , who was last seen ... They 're everywhere . In every bar , every port , every ship that can fly . We had nowhere to go but here ... and all because of you . I 'm worth seven million . That 's frelling with her head too . Why are you shaving now ? I finally figured out wormholes . You did it ? All that wormhole nonsense we put up with ? Yep . I can get you home . If I knew where home was or ... where we are . Or where the wormhole network is . Yah . And if we weren 't trapped with only two weapons and about to die . Well , the good news is ... who better to save a Leviathan than us , huh ? So ... we stay away from doggie . We find the Grudeks and we bring ' em down , so ... I get it . She says her flesh will re-bond , so Ryg ... you go fetch her hand . Pip , you 're with me . Why me ? Severed heads , severed hands . It 's a motif . Get rid of the animal . How hard can that be ? You saw Sikozu 's hand , or lack thereof ? Yah . And I saw her . Don 't ... confuse ... us . Alright . Let 's talk about it . Whatever " it " is . You know th ... those visions I was havin ? Yah . Yah , well they evolved . Into what ? There 's a ... a cheat proof game at the casinos . A , uh , a mecury droplet it ... it bounces off an island stream . - And then there 's a thousand different outcomes ... - Yah , right . You won ? Seven times . In a row . They arrested me . They took my winnings . They ... They had a little fun and ... and ... and a little torture noth ... nothin new . On the upside , you 're not crazy . You see the future . That 's what 's so weird . I ... I see the present ... only it 's just all ... just all it slows down . So what 's the bad ? Blinding headaches afterwards . It 's ... it 's like my eyes , they ... they ... they get all used up and I ... I can 't see . And , uh ... And each time it happens it ... it lasts longer . We get outta here , we find someone to fix it . Before then , we gotta find a way to screw the pooch , and I 'm gonna need a rope , a rabbit and a membrane . Ropes are mine . Rest is yours . Crichton ... I 'm as near as I can get . They 're still down here . Grudek ! This cell is not etal . But we are near ! Up one , over one ! There it is . That 's a Crichton kick . Boy . Yah . Girls do kick harder . Maybe it 's not mine at all . You just won 't let that rest , will you ? No , maybe it 's got a little ponytail and a teeny tiny goatee . Maybe . - Maybe there 's half a metal face on it . - Maybe . Maybe it 's a royal pain in the ass , eats all the time and farts a lot . Then we 'll know it 's yours . That 's a Crichton kick . Ahh ! Still obsessed , I see . I 'm not obsessed . Did she say anything to you before she left ? Good-bye , good luck , good riddance . That 's what you said . And I 'm not obsessed . Ohh , wormholes , Aeryn , Earth , Aeryn , Scorpius , Aeryn . I 'm out of fingers . Want me to keep counting on hers ? Aeryn ... - She say anything to you before she left ? - Oh , Crichton ! For once , listen . When a woman , whether she 's your wife , your lover , or a slave you purchased to be your wife or lover ... leaves you repeatedly ... take the hint . Well ... that was the plan but ... you know how my plans go . The bargain is struck . Can 't say I 'm surprised . You have ruined it ! Enough ! Enough ! Look at what she did ! Look what she did ! Back ! Freaky ... made a deal with rotting flesh over there , and he tried to kill me . Because she shot at him first . You see what that is ? You know what that is ? Come on . Tell me . Crindars . Scarran currency . You betcha . And you know ... you know where he get it from ? Her . Nebari , Hynerian , and you ... All from the Peacekeeper realm . What kind of currency do you have in YOUR pocket ? - Pip , you think she 's a Scarran ? - No , of course I 'm not . I 'm Kalish , and we hate the Scarrans . But I did grow up in their territory , yes . So , uh ... what was the plan ? This . Bloodless , I 'll bet you know what that is too . It 's a nebula pod , from a flight racer . He liked me . I bought us an escape vehicle ! After they left , he was going to leave his ship behind , so we could live ! They have found the etal cavity . This ship will be dead soon , or shortly thereafter . So ... what was " your " plan ? An open hatchway . Why aren 't we sucked out ? Ask her . The Pilot is using the Leviathan 's mass to generate an electo-static membrane . One puncture , and vavoosh ! That 's totally insane . You did not run into the Brindz Hound . We will never get close enough to stop them while it is loose . And that means they 're harvesting toubray now . You guys ... Go find the " Slaughterhouse Five " . Make sure we 're ready to move . I 'm not goin with her . - Pip ... - Please ... She knows Leviathans better than we do . Alright , you go first ... in case I have to shoot you . I 'll ... keep Pilot alert . Oh no , Sparky . She 's fine . You got a job . You ever hear of " Rabbit to the hound " ? Alright . We should split up . Wait . You go in the ... Chiana . I told you , I can go places you cannot . I 'd love to send you to one myself . Sarcasm . The hallmark of the sub-educated . Ohh , the only hallmark you 're gonna be is a small , small smudge on the wall after I shoot you . I told you ... I can go places you cannot . He has absolutely no appreciation of my worth in a crisis . Let him find his own frelling hound . It 's beautiful . You 're Picasso . Alright . I want you to go hide . Run away . It 's gonna be ugly . You don 't want to see this . It 's dinner time . Come see the tastey human goat . Staked out like an idiot . You wanted him , you got him . What 'sa matter ? You not hungry ? Red rover , red rover , send Kujo right over . Come on , doggie . Damn you ! Come on . Come on . Come on , yah , yah , yah , come on . You want some 'a this ? Yah ! Grade A Prime American beef . Come on . Come on , damn you ! Hey ! Hey ! What the hell 's your problem ? Can 't even hit a door . Come on ! Come on , baby . Bring it on ! Yah ! You know you want some 'a this . Come on ! Waahoo ! Right here , right here , right now ! Door ! Door ! Door ! Door ! Door ! Thanks . That was a plan . Enterprising you are . Expecting you I have been . What to do now ? You know , Shikozu ... A chance you took to come here . Understand . By contracting for my service , I am forbidden to reveal anything . The pathetic bearded one must offer little hope for you to risk my mercy . Highly ineffective , but he will fight . We will be gone before they can reach us . My worries now are few . I hope I am not one of them . Go back . Diverge them astray . When we withdraw , I shall honor your contribution and take you with us . Thank you , Warlord . My blessings . You 're not exactly a team player , are you ? Don 't worry , I 'm not gonna hurt 'cha . Told Chiana she could do that . Alright . Here 's the deal . We 're gonna be really , really quiet , so the Pirates of the Caribbean don 't hear us , okay ? Pilot ... tell Miss Booksmart how many kids you got . Six ... before I was joined with Elack . You 're a mommy killer . How does that make you feel ? I do not choose my assignments . I simply follow orders . Follow orders ? I thought you were smart . You can 't come up with somethin better than that ? I studied harder than you could imagine . I sacrificed more than you will ever attain . Do not presume to moralize with your narrow perspective . Listen ... to what Pilot intercepted . Returning to retrieve you now , Warlord . No other suitable Leviathans found . Grudex ... was the message sent ? Her employers are aware , Sikozu 's own errors in judgement cost her her life . Welcome to the universe . No . No , that 's ... that 's not fair . That 's not right . I will not have my reputation tainted by a negative report . Allow me to give you another narrow perspective . Your options are limited . So you can either help or we 're gonna truss you up like a Christmas turkey and pop you in the bilge . Do I have another option ? No . - You have to resist shooting at them . - Yes ... I got it . - If the hoses are ruptured in the wrong order , you 'll create an air-fuel bomb ... - that will destroy the whole ship . Yes . Chiana , you don 't have to do this if you don 't want to . I said I would , Crichton . Just go . Yah , but if you don 't wanta ... Oh , for yotz sake , she gets more blind from drinking razlak . Right . By popular demand ... Alright , when Chiana gets up here , she comes off , bucket of bolts goes on . It 's a zip . Alright Pip . Your call . Let 's fly ! - Warlord Ilkog ! - What ? - He was falling . - Where ? There . I swear an oath ! What is that ? I 'm blind . Just ... lights and shapes . Get her down . Tell me about the hoses . White ... far right , white hose . Mmmm , some kind of mist . Frozen hydrogen dixoride . In the center , orange welding pipe . Black jackhammer on the left . Errg ! Where 's your frelling arm ? Stop spinning and reach for it ! What 's the order ? Right , left ... left , center . No deviation . Hydrogen first , right ? Then adding the jackhammer 's pressurized grontium should prevent the explosion from being catastrophic . Light it up with the well ... Not my hand ! Ohhh ! You dredgenaught ! 1812 ! Covering fire ! Damnit ! Covering fire ! Fire you frellnik , fire ! Right , center ... No , right , left , center . Oh ... Dren , dren , dren ! Right . Left . Center . Yah ! Yah , Come on , baby . Yah ! Please , baby . Please , baby . Please , baby . Please . Ry ... gel ! Do not drop my hand . Oh , why am I bothering ? I gotcha . I gotcha . I , uh ulp . I tried . Rygel , you bas ... tard ! I tried . No Pilot muerte . Alright . Here 's the thing . You might not want to come with us . We are not ... the best traveling companions . I am going to get my life back . I will not end up like you . Okay . I hate that you 're doin this . The returning Grudek ship would have destroyed us if we hadn 't left the Sacred Space . And we would like to repay our debt ... before we pass . You don 't owe us ... anything . Nevertheless , if we are able , you shall arrive at the planet where you think your friends may be . It was your dream . Yours and Elack 's to die there . No dream is guaranteed , Commander . The grace of age is we ... we learn to accept . Not coming here anymore . Why not ? It doesn 't change anything , and it makes me sad . So what 's next ? What 's left ? Wormholes . I gotta ... recreate a ton of equations . The new girl smashed ' em up . Hmm . New ? New is good . Not always . Hey , babe . Thanks . Who 's this ? No one . Subtitles : PK SUB-66

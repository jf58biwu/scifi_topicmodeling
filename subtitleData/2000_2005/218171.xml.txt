 The code name of this mission is " Cage " . Our target persons are Skinny and Dragon . As being informed by the " God of undercover " , Skinny will trade booties with his buyer tomorrow . Skinny is a real smart criminal . We 've traced his gang for 3 years and set him up for 8 times , but he 's still on the run . So , during this mission , our motive is surveillance and to guard afar from the targets . The dealing place is in Bay Street , Central . We 'll send the least manpower at the scene . Jesus will have a close contact with the console ... and report every details . He still gets the gypsum cast on his leg , can he make it ? His gypsum cast will be removed two days later , so , don 't worry . It 's better to have it on , so it won 't cause Skinny 's suspicion . Jesus always spoils things by acting impulsively . If he sees Skinny , I bet he would fire at once . I won 't let him be armed . He will just support us . We can have many choices among the force . Why not brush him off ? This information was traced by him . It would be a heartless thing to brush him off . I 'm sorry ... The God of Undercover would be there , he 'll take care of Jesus . The US Consulate Would you please explain the oracle of this lot to me ? I just wanted to leave , I think it 's fate brought you to me , well , I 'll help you . What is the number ? It 's number 97 . Number 97 again ? Everyone got this lot today . It 's number 97 again . It tells the story of Kuen Suen Wan . " When I consider how my light is spent , Ere half my days , in this dark world and wide . " What does that mean ? What do you mean ? The meaning of this oracle ... I see , you mean the meaning of this oracle ! I thought you were asking something else ! This tells the story of Kuen Suen Wan . " When I consider how my light is spent , Ere half my days , in this dark world and wide . " If you ask for money , you 'll get reputation , and vise versa . For money , you 'll get sick ; for health , you 'll have a baby . If you ask for a baby , you 'll have a fair marriage . If you ask about marriage , you 'll have a trip . If you ask for success , you can make it after great effort . That 's the oracle of the lot . Do you understand ? You already read it once , you are just repeating . I want to know the meaning of it . The second paragraph ... Let 's go ! Are you okay , Jesus ? What happens ? The two fools approached me for fortune telling ! They really scared me . They are now leaving and approaching the target . Get your ass ready ... Well done , just keep observing . All right , they are beginning to deal now . How do you do ? God bless you ! You speak in English ? Good Morning . How about Mandarin ? Cantonese would do either . That 's great ! You 're my idol . Come on , shall we take a picture ? Come on ... Closer please . Where do those green men come from ? What does that mean ? Can you make it clear ? Bastard ! You want to trap us ? Hands off ! Don 't go ! Give me the money . Take care of your colleagues . Jesus , what 's happened ? What made that noise ? What the hell is it ? It 's just a mess ! How do you do ? God bless you ! Why don 't you go and arrest them ? I 'll be right there . Come out now , they are leaving ! Jesus , don 't go ! Go to hell ! Hands off me ! Take it back . - Hands off ! - Stop fighting for it , let 's escape . Hands off ! Hands off ! Hands off ! Leave the bag ! Hurry up ! You 're so clumsy ! He 's still tailing us , he got all the money . What 's up ? Bitch ! Never again . Yes sir . You claim this knapsack was got from Skinny . Guess what is inside . Guess what is inside my wallet . I didn 't look at it , how do I know it ? That 's right , I didn 't check it too , how do I know what is inside ? You think there is booty ? Look at it . How do you know these are not booties ? There was no one around , you can tell us anything you like . What the hell is this shit ! You are now telling anything you like . What 's up in your mind ? This is the 9th time Skinny and Dragon have escaped from the police . We don 't know we will have another chance to catch them or not . That 's right , the worst thing is , we lost the money . I wish we could at least get the booty to satisfy our boss . Well , I think those who executed the task should take the responsibility . All right , I 'll take all the blames . This sounds good . Be frank , we should discuss the next step . I suggest more meetings to be held . Yes , we should discuss with some more departments . That 's right , you used to support , you 'd call the meetings . All right ... I bet you would suggest nothing in the coming meetings . Madam said she became the scapegoat for us . She was transferred to the Transport Department . She asked whether we want to go with her or not . What ? Traffic police . What ? Riding motorbike . - What ? - Be a traffic police ! Okey , I give you the hat . I 've checked everything in the bag . The only lead is the logo on this clothe . Is this a new brand name ? I haven 't seen it before . Where was it produced ? Japan , I guess . I think it 's sold in the shopping mall for trendy clothing . It 's made in Hong Kong . But this is a school badge . Cool ! Now , they are on summer holiday . Only a part of students are taking summer course there . It 's more convenient to our investigation . After a meeting , we agreed to send you two there as undercover . - Principal ? - Principal ? I won 't bother you from investigating in the school ... but on one condition . What is it ? When you find the money , you can take it back . But the related student should be left behind for us . If that student didn 't do it unintentionally , or , she is the partner of the wanted criminal , she must be handled by the police , we can 't leave her to you . The school is the farm of God . Those students are all lost sheep . No one is criminal . Well , anything she says , just let it go ... Say yes , okay ? Let ' s go . All right . There is much blood ! Look ! Take it slowly ... Be careful or it would be cut . What are you looking ? I wonder why these clothes are not of the same color . It represents different school teams , we 've table tennis team , basketball team , badminton team , football team , American football team , and hockey team too . Girls , let me introduce them to you . This is Father Gum , he is going to teach in the moral science class . Let me ... How about this one ? This is a new classmate of yours . Her name is ... Please introduce yourself . Hello , my name is May , nice to meet you . What 's wrong with it ? Sandy ! Although I ve a weird look to you , my deformed bones were caused after a serious disease , so I need a special cradle to hold my body . I had my vocal cords damaged too . But I don 't mind being teased . That 's right , girls , although May has got a deformed body , she has a very strong mind . Push . I am sorry , sister , I 'll see you in your office later . All right . Thank you . - Let me help you ! - We 'll help you . Don 't go ! You vampire ! I am a vampire ! Monster , are you looking for trouble ? Be gentle , okay ? - Stop ! - I want your blood ! I am the masked superman ! Are you all right ? I wouldn 't have answered you if I were dead . Are you crazy ? The campus is so huge ! But why do you ride here ? Are you kidding ? You just rushed out suddenly . What the hell ! You just rode carelessly . You walked carelessly ! It 's your fault . Stop arguing . Let me introduce , this is Miss Leung . The girls love calling her Miss " Cool " . This is Father Gum . This is May , a new student . From now on , we are like a family , okay ? Stay in peace , okay ? Cool ! Well , time is almost up , let 's prepare for the class . Let 's go . - Bye ! - Bye ! Miss Cool . Bye ! Miss Cool . Father , are you here for supervision ? - What ? - Do you come for a supervision ? No , I come for ... I just pass by . Come on ... Money is the sole thing to define the value of life . I don 't agree with it . What is your problem ? You said money is the sole standard to prove the value of life , that means , only the rich can live happily . Then , are all the poor people leading miserable lives ? As we know , most of the people on earth are poor . There are not many rich people at all . So it 's not the world for poor people , they should die , right ? Father Gum . Go ahead , just tell us what you have in mind . What are you doing here ? Please take a seat , please take your seat ... Take your seat . Do you agree ? In real life , actually there are many people living unhappily . Let 's just take Hong Kong as a sample . After the financial turmoil , you have seen many long faces , haven 't you ? It 's because the people judge happiness by money . So , many people pull long faces . Look ! When you read the news of the entertainment business , the papers always report how much an artist earns , or , how much a person makes from a bet on the football match . Also , how much a football player is sold to another football team ... I just want to watch a game , I won 't care how much they earn . Say a building collapsed , the value of it would never be missed , and the amount the insurance co . Should pay must be reported . Hey , people died , how does the figure matter with the death ? But what you mentioned are reality . We live in this community , if we don 't accept it , how can we communicate with other people ? I don 't read that kind of news . I still can communicate with others . Communicate ? Communicate ! Communicate ? Let 's communicate ! What brand name is all the go in these days ? Come on , show us ! Right . In order to have a further communication with you , I will chat with you one by one . Why a father has come suddenly ? We haven 't heard anything from the principal beforehand . Yeah , he is weird . I wonder ! Is he really a father ? And that girl ... I think she is weird too . Better be cautious . If he plays any trick , the girls of the Hung Hing Society will not spare him . All right , I 'll have a check on him . Wipe the face . Tong So-sum , father : Unknown . Mother : Dead . Guardian : Grandmother . Address : 3 / F , 179 Temple Street . Her school fee of the whole year is already paid ? Piggy , have you forgotten the keys again ? Granny , I am not Piggy . I am Candy 's classmate , my name is May . She went for a tutor class , why don 't you come in and wait ? Thank you , granny . Granny , is Candy your family ? I am her grandmother . You mistook me as Piggy , who is Piggy then ? Piggy is Candy . Her father named her Piggy because of a superstitious reason . Did she get sick easily when she was small ? No , but her father did many bad deeds . So named her Piggy What is her father 's job ? I think you 're thirsty , get some tea by yourself . Thank you . Why can 't I see a picture of Candy and her father ? Are you a police ? Do you come for an investigation ? No ! Candy looks so pretty , so I am curious to know whether she is like her father or not . It has nothing to do with him . She inherits from her mother and me . I can tell that from your face . I bet you were a great beauty when you were young . Sure ! Let me help you , okay ? Why are you here ? - I come for you . - What for ? I can 't any friends in the class ... but except you , I think you can be my best friend . Come on . I don 't need friends . Go on ... I need friends . Do you feel comfortable , granny ? Yes ! I feel great . I 've got informed that ... Let 's assume the Hung Hing Society is linked with Skinny . It 's not an assumption , that girl did come to assist Skinny . Target ... locked . Miss Cook ... No , it 's Miss Cool . Miss Cook ? Miss Cook and the 13 Hung Hing girls ? How do you know there are 13 girls in the Hung Hing Society ? Let 's go . Why did you join the Hung Hing Society ? Why ? I did it for Sandy . Look ! She is as tall as I am , we match each other . But the character counts most . We are both insane , that 's the correct feeling . I have feeling on her . Look , she looks fat . I love pinching her face . She has a round body , I love hugging her so much . Most important of all is , both of us ... we are silly enough . That makes a perfect match . Why did you join the Hung Hing Society ? How are you ? My name is Sandy , nice to meet you . I am fifteen years old , how about you ? How old are you ? I am a Japanese , don 't you know Japanese ? You moron , you know nothing about Japanese ? - You are so cute . - Thank you . What are you doing ? What is your name ? Candy Tong . What ? Spell C-a-n-d-y , T-o-n-g . My name is Gum , spell G-u-m . Why do you always pull a long face ? All right , I won 't pull a long face again . Can you aim it sharp for me ? All right . I 'll try . Ready ? I am going to shoot now . Just because of your smile , I will make it for you . Got it ? I shot at an old granny . Why don 't you stay with us for practice ? No way , my father has to go abroad tonight , it 's a rare chance to have a dinner with him . All right , I will call you later . - All right , bye ! - Bye ! May , are you waiting for your driver ? No , I am waiting for Father Gum . He promised to pick me up after school . Let me give you a ride . No , thanks , Father Gum is on his way . Never mind , come on ! Don 't you treat me as your friend ? I don 't want to give you trouble . No way ! Thank you , Sandy . You 're welcome . I 'll come tomorrow to pick you to school , okay ? Okay , bye ! Are you missing her ? Do you live here ? We are neighbours , aren 't we ? Please help me to get up . I just live upstairs . I am not so familiar with you . I don 't live upstairs . I come to tell you to stay away from Sandy . Oh shit ! Why it always causes misunderstandings when people try to care about me ? Don 't worry , I am a disabled person , it 's a drag anyway . But I won 't become a drag of love for anyone . Let me send you home . Let me help you ! You 're so clumsy . How can you help me ? Let me carry you home . - Thank you ! - Come on . Why my heart is beating so fast ? I am leaving , bye ! Why don 't you come to my home and have some tea ? Miss Cool is definitely our first target . I tried to check from the school 's files . From her 14th to 19th , all information of the five years had been intentionally deleted . She has hid a secret without doubt . As I know , she had been living in Taiwan in the past few years . I will try to check on her through some Taiwan data banks . Well done . I will ask someone to check on Miss Cool too . Jesus , what are you looking ? Low cut , tube top , see-through dress ... What a sexy bomb ! I decided to move into the hostel to check on her . Work harder ! Does he know whom he is going to check ? Miss Cool , right ? Sandy doesn 't live here . I come for you . - For me ? - Yes . Come in . Do you ... have any special feeling about me ? If you don 't say a word , I would take it a positive answer . We are now students , and we are both girls . I don 't think it 's a good time for us to be in love . Who cares , just be happy . But I am not a lesbian . Don 't cheat yourself ! When I carried you today , your reaction told me that you did have some special feeling . Isn 't it a betrayal to Sandy ? I don 't want to cheat on her . It 's me who is cheating on her . By the way , it 's me who is seducing you . You ... I came to ask May 's advice in doing some homework ... That 's right ... Father Gum , why are you here ? I am ... You have extraordinary relationship , haven 't you ? No , I ... Yes ! - He is my mother . - Mother ? - I am your mother ? - Yes ! I said ... I am your mother ? Yes ! Yes , I am his mother . You are my daughter . Yes ... But , you are a priest . She ... can be my daughter , why can 't I be her mother ? I said ... Hey , wait ... This was my previous look . But after a summon of God , I became a father . Dad , stop it , I can stand no more . Well ... you ... go on . Poor you ! Miss Cool ? Yes ... I 'll be right there , all right , bye ! I 've got an important task , I must leave now . Who are you going to meet ? Miss Cool . So , go now . All right , see you then . - Bye ! - Bye ! Hello ! You are tough ! You are sick and you could fight that well , If you recover , I bet the Hung Hing girls are no match for you . I am disabled , but I have tough mind . - Are those girls capable in fighting ? - Yes . One two three ... One two three ... Are they dancing Para-para ? That 's karate . Is Hung Hing Society a karate club ? What do you think it is ? One two three ... One ... Enough . Enough what ? I 've discovered a big secret . The Hung Hing Society is a karate club . Karate club ? It can be a triad society too . But they practise karate seriously . They can still be triad members . But it 's far from our predictions . Do you want to close the file now ? No ... You don 't , so what do you want ? Father , do you want to play the piano ? - Do you know how to play this song ? - No . - Do you know it ? - No . How about this one ? - No . - Do you know it ? No . How about this one ? No . Do you know it ? No ! Don 't you know this ? You know ? Why don 't you play the piano and I dance ? All right , let 's play together . Sons of God . Sons of God . Sons of God . Sons of God . Sons of God , hear his holy word ! Gather round the table of the Lord ! Eat his Body , drink his Blood , And we 'll sing a song of love : Allelu , allelu , allelu ... The song is over . This is the moral science lesson , not the music class . Today , I would like to tell you Jesus ' story . First ... I would like to tell you ... The 7 sins . Have you watched the movie " Seven " ? Anyone watched it before ? This is a famous film , anyone watched it ? Do you know which 7 sins are they ? How much will I get by answering this question ? Hong Kong people are always money minded . That gives the Chief Executive a big problem . We should copy the Chief Executive , that is , ideal goes first . Ideal is very important , knowledge is also important too . First , which sin do you want to start first ? Lust . All right , I couldn 't imagine that you are so enthusiastic about this topic ... Class , we have some officers from the Education Dept . And parent representatives to visit your class , just go ahead with your lesson . Where were we up to ? Lust . Well , it 's the topic of lust , why not you start it first ? What lust is it ? Lust ! Just anything you want to tell about lust , okay ? I think it 's you who should start the topic . We are here to listen your preaching , aren 't we ? Good ... but this is a very flexible class . I want to have an interacted relationship with you all . By the way , this is a moral lesson . That 's why I want to open your mind first . When your mind is opened , then I can start with the topic , lust . So , you first . I 'll give you 30 seconds , take your time to talk about lust . What should I say ? Just start from any simple things you know . How about dreams ? Do you always have dreams ? Yes I do . - Oh no ! - No ? Isn 't there anyone having no dream ? You must have dreams . Tell us some dreams which impressed you most . All right , I 'll tell you . All right , let me tell you . I didn 't ask you to tell us your story , sit down . I want ... What do you want ? I want to listen to her . Someone wants to listen to you ! Well , go ahead . People always think that the disabled persons are defective , that the disabled people would have no sex desire . It is wrong . In fact , I am like you all . I do want to have sex with my idol . Who is your idol ? It 's you . Me ? Yes , it 's you . You are tom-boy like but you 're girlish sometimes . You 're tough . But I can sense a young lady 's melancholy from your eyes . You 're my dream lover . Do you take me a lesbian ? It doesn 't matter . Most important of all , I want to be your friend . So we can walk on the beach and chat what 's deep in our hearts . Bull-shit ! Why did I tell such thing ? It 's embarrassing . I heard that you had an outstanding performance in your class . Outstanding ? I think I would be out soon . No way ! Sister Mo and Sandy 's daddy are on your side . They will support you . Who is Sandy ? Sandy , the girl in your class . Sandy ? I see ! This isn 't mine . This is mine . This is mine . I 'll pay for it , this is my treat . Thank you . You 're lucky . The guy I treated him to dinner last time was shot 18 times when he stepped out of the restaurant . Are you still investigating the Hung Hing Society ? Investigation ? No , I am just being curious . How much do you know about karate ? I know it quite well . Let 's play karate when you have time . What the hell is it ? That isn 't a stance in karate . Yours isn 't a stance in karate . Yours isn 't a stance in karate . You 're tricking me ! How can you claim this karate ? Is it over ? Why it took you so long ? - Yeah ! - Why it took you so long ? Hurry up . What are you doing ? Don 't mistake me ... I thought it 's pretty , so I tried to feel it . I thought it 's pretty . Is this pretty ? Yes , I want to buy one , I just want to buy one . It 's for female . That 's right , haven 't tried it before , I just want to buy one . But , why is it white ? Why can 't it be white ? There are red , blue , green and black colored ones . I want a red one . Can you give me some water to wash my hands ? - Sure . - Thank you . It 's great . Let me tell you something about the boys . I sit next to you , you are my best friend . We play together in the playground . Our wish is to become prefects in the coming days . I am very curious about the new coming student . The new coming student is always attractive to the class . Tell me , are you falling for him ? Have you tried to know more about him behind me ? Both of us are afraid of mentioning about him . You drank his tea without telling me . How could I imagine you 'd behave like this for him ? It 's too much to wipe like this . Take it back . I don 't want it , it 's so dirty . I 'll return it to you after washing , okay ? No ! You wiped your body thoroughly . Just take it . You want to give it to me ? So this is mine . Please don 't wipe like this , you 've gone too far . It 's dirty ! Didn 't your daddy teach you cleaning ? I don 't have a father . Who gave birth to you then ? Are you a replicate ? My mother gave birth to me ! But your mother needed your father 's sperm , baby ! When I was small , my father went into fugitive . He didn 't take care of my mother and me . When my mom died , he didn 't come back . He didn 't even burn incense to mom . How can you take such kind of man as your dad ? My mom always said my dad is the worst guy in the world . But she always teaches me , " No matter how bad he is , he still is your father . " " You 're always his kid , you know that ? " You 're something . - Funny ? - Yes ! You 're something ! Is that funny ? I 'll return it to you later , okay ? No ! Don 't wipe ! May . Come here . What 's the matter ? Can you take it out for me ? You want me to eat them all ? No . Just one piece , okay ? No ... just wait for a while . Wait for a while ! Don 't eat . It 's tasty . Granny , the vegetable is so sweet . Good girl . Take one . Thank you . Try it , isn 't it tasty ? You cook better than your mom did . It 's true . The guy who marries you in future must be very lucky . Do you mean it ? It 's true . Why did you make that noise ? Nothing , it 's because of the rice . What ? Nothing , I just want to eat a piece of squid . It 'd be nice if you do the clean up . Can you wash for me ? I hate washing . Can you stop asking for my help ? Let me help you . No , I can make it . Don 't ! You 're strong enough . Are you coming for me ? Yes , Maggie wants to break up with me . Why ? It 's because of you ! Maggie likes you better . But I have no feeling about her . Are you in preference of her now ? No , I do like you . But , it 's because I like her , is that okay ? All right , take good care of her . Maggie ... Thank you . May I kiss you ? Stop pretending . What do you mean ? I knew you are not a girl . Actually I don 't want to be a boy . This is beyond my wish . My parents wanted to have a girl . God knows that they had me . Since I was born , they dressed me like a girl . They wanted me to play Barbie toys . When I grew up , I really hate to be a boy . If not were my sickness , I would have changed my sex . You knew I am a boy , so why did you kiss me ? When you kissed me , did you take me as a boy ? I didn 't think of that , I just want to observe your reaction . It 's just a kind of impulsive move . You don 't have to take any responsibility of it . But I am a boy , it would cause ... What ? It would cause trouble to me . Except you , do any other classmate know my sex ? I don 't know , but it doesn 't matter . Not all the girls like being lesbians . It 's funny to have a boy sneaking in . What a failure ... I thought I could have cheated the whole world . But I was cheated by the whole world instead . Forget it , why not give us some time to think it over ? Just to think what relationship should be used next time . Next time ? Isn 't the game over ? What are you doing here ? Want some wine ? What are you doing here ? I lost my contact lens . Are you alright ? Aren 't you happy ? Yes , I am not happy . Why aren 't you happy ? It 's because of my father . Where is your father ? My father died . How can a dead person make you feel unhappy ? Stop thinking nonsense , let 's play with the sand . Hurry up ! Although he is a bit weird , he makes me think of my father . When I was small , my father took me to the beach one day . He told me that our hometown is on the other side of the sea . I told him that we would go home one day . My father touched my head and said nothing . Since then , he took me to the shore frequently . We built our hometown with sand . Later , I became a rebel as many girls did . I left home . Until his death , we ... We didn 't go back home . You know that ? When I was small , my father taught me a song . - Really ? - A kid 's song . Let me teach you . Sure . When I think of my dad , I would sing this song . The little girl carried the doll on her back , walked in the garden and laughed . The little girl cried , the birds on the trees laughed at that . The little girl carried the doll on her back , thinking of her mother again . Let 's go dancing . Is it what your father did when you sang ? Let me teach you dancing , I learnt it when I was small , come on . Come on . Little girl carried a doll on her back . Are you going to carry me on your back ? She was laughing here and there . Carry me , no ... Let me carry you . No way ! Why ? Dance , dancing is all right . Let 's dance . Little girl carried a doll on her back , thinking of her mother again . Little girl cried for her dad , the birds laughed at that . Little girl carried the doll on her back , thinking of her mother again . She is naked . You see that ? There is a naked woman ... - No ... - Where is she ? It 's a tree ! This song brings me lots of memories . Go on singing ... The little girl carried a doll on her back , the birds laughed at that . There is a worm on my shirt . The little girl cried for mother , the birds laughed at that . Who hit me ? You 're back . Are you all right ? Why didn 't you report for duty last night ? I am so sleepy , I want some sleep now . Let 's talk about it later . Who hit me ? I am your boss . You should report to me of what you did last night ! Report ... You didn 't come back last night . Yes ... Can you hear me ? I feel so sleepy ! If you were on duty last night , I wouldn 't have to worry . I worry that you would commit the taboos for an undercover . What taboo ? To have an affair with the target . Who has target with an affair ? - It happened ... - I ... I do . I have an affair with my target . What are you doing here ? I have a target with my affair . Maggie is nice . She is tom-boy like , but she is gentle indeed . It 's not Maggie , it 's Candy . Ken , you already have had a girlfriend . Now , you have fallen for another one ... How can you treat a girl like this ? How can you explain to her parents ? Candy is cool outside and hot inside , hot outside and cool inside . It 's hard to meet such a nice girl . She won 't fall for a disabled girl . Well , it 's simple , she knows I am not a girl at all . She knows you are not a girl ? Madam , let 's close this file . It would be dangerous since his identity is disclosed . Let 's pack up and leave ... It 's great to close file , let 's call it a day . Aren 't you sleepy now ? I ... His identity has been disclosed , but yours is not . Anyway , I haven 't got enough information about Miss Cool yet . I 've checked her over for a night , what else do you want to know about her ? One night ? Can you tell me the details ? I am sleepy now , I can 't tell you now . What are you doing here ? I am waiting for you . Why waiting for me ? - What is it ? - Fishing . Fishing ? This is marshmallow . Are you the fish which loves eating marshmallow ? Is it your treat ? Eat it then . You want to give it to me ? Take it if you can . I don 't like this game . Where are you going ? Follow me if you want to know it . You want me to escape from school with you , what do you want ? Today is the birthday of my mom . You want me to pay a visit to her grave ? But the graveyard isn 't around . My grandma brings me here on each of my mother 's birthday . She said my mother started the romance with him right here . Him ? I see , you mean your father . Last night , I heard my granny saying that ... they left love marks somewhere around . Let 's go and find it out . It 's embarrassing . Let 's go and find it out . Jane ... In the next year ... I don 't know whether I can come to see you again . Police are tracing us tightly . I have to leave for another place . I don 't know whether I would come back alive . The Principal said Piggy 's got good academic result in school . Some universities abroad are willing to matriculate her in the coming year . I am useless ! But our daughter is really great . I can 't take care of her . I hope you would ... you would bless for her . Dad ! It 's a small world . The girl I 've fallen for ... is his daughter . My daughter said you are her best friend . Yes , I would treat her the way you treated her mom . Anyway , my daughter 's favor goes first . You like her , then , take good care of her . If she is willing , I would take care of her forever . I would count on you . Uncle , we 'll have a picnic for the graduating class . Most of the parents would come along , would you join us ? Dad said that he met his Waterloo here and wanted to start all over again in some place else . Do you trust him ? I know he 's been a thief since I was small . If you are a cop , would you arrest my father ? My only dream is ... My dream is to dress this uniform for a patrol . I would be glad even if it 's just once . Since I graduated from the cadet school , I 've become the undercover . Although I performed many roles and always acted seriously , I seldom put in my love in any cases ... But this time ... I am in deep shit . What are you doing ? Guess how high I can fly ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Nuts ! Class , we are here today , we 'll have lots of activities here . First , we 'll play two kinds of game here . First , war game , and the other is a survival game . Follow Father Gum for war game . For survival game , follow me . What ? What did you say ?

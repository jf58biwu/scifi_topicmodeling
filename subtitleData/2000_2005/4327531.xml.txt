We aim to please , or as the French say : Eighteen years of marriage , and we 've never missed a night . Or morning . Good night , my love . Rise and shine me . Ironic . We spent all morning capping pesticides and my Manwich has been gnawed by a rat . Don 't worry , Bob . I 'm springing for lunch . How about a couple of bouillon cubes ? Bouillon cubes ? Whoa , Mr. Rockefeller . - What 's the occasion ? - l 'm engaged . Hey , bouillon cube . James , you dog . So who 's the lucky gal ? I don 't know . She hasn 't been delivered yet . Oh , James , you can 't marry a baby . No , she 's a mail-order bride , silly . I bought her on eBay . I 'm giving her this tomorrow . It 's one of those cloudy , yellowy diamonds the women love . James , I 'm very happy for you . I only hope that your marriage is as wonderful as mine and Pickles ' . Thanks , Bob . Hey , you 're coming to my big bachelor party tonight , right ? The whole gang will be there . - What gang ? - The one I bought on eBay . Steve99 @ xcom , packerfan @ teknet . Sounds like a super-giant gasser . Hey , I have some funny napkins I could bring . Aren 't these napkins hilarious ? See , the fat cow is labeled " whole milk " and the skinny cow is labeled " skim milk . " - lsn 't that priceless ? - Get away from me . Good lord . That woman has no blouse on . My God . She 's making it worse . Bob , this is a strip joint . A what ? I thought it was a colonial-themed steakhouse . Hear ye , hear ye . Let 's give it up for a great patriot , Lady Amber , from the County of Cleavage as she declares independence from her knickers . Thanks , James . It 's been a hoot and a half but I gotta get home and scrub off the rank stench of this place . Please , I beseech you , my lady . My fair wife wouldn 't approve . Careful , there . My family jewels are on the first floor . Miss , your clogs are getting awfully close to my- - That 's nasty . - Well , no sex for a couple of weeks . - A couple of weeks ? My wife and I have never missed a night . Then what the hell were you doing in a strip joint , you dirty pig ? It 's really none of your- - You know , your bedside manner could use a little work . Sorry . This ought to gross them out on the Internet . Pickles . Hi , dear . - Sorry I 'm late. l- - - The captain of the S.S. Lovin is on the bridge . All hands on me . I 'm awfully tired , dear . Coming on too strong for you , huh ? All right , we 'll change it up . Oh , my . Who is this dangerous intruder in my bed ? - Pickles , I 'm really not in the mood . - Not in the mood ? I don 't understand . is something wrong ? No , everything 's fine . I 'm just zonked . Good night . But , Bob . It 's so quiet in here without the sounds of love . Kids , I 'm gonna ask you a question and I want you to be brutally honest . - ls Mommy still sexy ? - Gross . - Aren 't you , like , 30 or something ? - Thanks . I think you 're beautiful , Mommy . Oh , baby . You have a pretty mustache . Dude , you look thrashed . I didn 't get any shuteye . Except for this one , which doesn 't count because there 's something wrong with me . Hey , Bob . How about a quickie in the broom closet ? Gotta get to work . It 's miniature pizza day . Bye . What 's happening to us ? Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God ... . Thanks for coming with me to meet my fiancée , Bob . I 'm kind of nervous . James , relax . Your lonely days are over . I don 't like the looks of that . - Are you James ? - Yes . This is your wife . Congratulations . You have six hours to dispose of the body . Would you throw some rice on us , Bob ? James , this coffin is leaking . My Bob isn 't attracted to me anymore , Anita . Let me get you a drink . I 'm too depressed to drink . Just give me a beer and a shot . I 'm sure it 's nothing to worry about . - Bob 's probably just having an affair . - What ? - Have you noticed any of the telltale signs ? - Like what ? Oh , like , is he irrepressibly chipper ? - He sure is . - Stingy with the hugs ? You know , I always have to hug him . is there a bounce in his step ? Oh , my God , he has been bouncing . Take it from me , he 's chasing strange . Well , no one 's stealing the love of my life . I 'm gonna follow him . What was I gonna do ? Lord , guard her heart , her soul , her leg , my nameless bride from Winnipeg . Amen . - How dare you steal my husband . - Me ? I 'm married to the Lord . - Hey , I 'm married to the Lord . - Oh , no , you 're not . - Why , you dirty- - - Why , you- - Nun pile ! Who is she ? I know you 're having an affair , Bob . That 's why you won 't make love to me . An affair ? That 's crazy . Don 't screw with me , Bob . I bit off a nun 's ear . Now tell me the truth . Okay , I 'll tell you . I went to James ' bachelor party , and a stripper stepped on your buddy . I 'm a filthy pig . Oh , Bob , I don 't care about that . - But I 'm a dirty birdie . - Yeah , but you 're my dirty birdie . Now , let 's never use that phrase again . Pickles , we still can 't have relations for a while . Oh , right . Well , we can do without sex . After all , we have a very rich relationship . - That we do , sugar lumps . - l mean , two weeks isn 't that long . Give me sex . Give me sex ! No means no . No means no . Okay , kids , we 're going to be working with some volatile chemicals today except for you , Milo since the school board has rated you a class-four maniac . I was just gonna brew up a nice cup of tea . You know , I don 't sleep . Man , you are butt ugly . Kids , Milo 's made a bomb . There , there , now. lt 's just my kettle . The old girl does jabber up a storm . Jasmine . He 's getting awfully fruity . He 's got to get some sleep . Just not before the crumpets are ready . Now , now , let them cool , you wee buggers . Things have been really awkward between me and Bob now that we can 't have sex . I 've never had sex where it wasn 't awkward . You have to think back to what brought you together in the first place . There 's that dreamy George Klimer . Look at that bulge in his shorts . Talk about a huge wallet . Georgie . Hey , look . That was quite a ride . I 've never seen anyone hang none before . Yeah , I guess I got some boss moves . Name 's Bobby , but the kids call me Bobby-o . They call me Pickles . I see why . You 're quite a dilly . Wow , you 're one of those fast boys . I 'll bet you hop with a bad crowd . Actually , what I really want is to have a family maybe break into the poison racket . You know , the American dream . Trouble is , haven 't found the girl next door yet . Well , I guess you 'll have to keep looking . - Say , do you feel like a malted ? - Sure . Well , you don 't look like one . - You 're fun . - Guilty . I love your culottes . Anita , do you have a brother ? Yeah , sure . Why not ? - President who ? - l didn 't say anything . - My bad . - Bob , what 's happening to us ? - We used to have fun together . - We 're eating soup with garlic croutons . - What do you want , woman ? - Well , let 's go out on the town . We can call another couple and double date . The only couple I know are James and his fiancée . I don 't know how much fun she 'll be . She 's dead and Canadian . I know , I 'll fix him up . Isn 't line dancing fun ? Unfortunately , I lack the two essential things you need to do it : Bolo tie and big belt buckle . Maybe we can try something I like to do ? Way to take it for the team , babe . - Now you try it , Anita . - Oh , I 'm just going to embarrass myself . No , don 't stand on the plate . And turn the bat around . - Aren 't you right-handed ? - Oh , who remembers ? Let 's see . " Waiter , can you put some Scotch in this ? " Yeah , I 'm a righty . This was all a mistake . Baby , can 't see . A little help ? Sweetie , is that you humming ? Oh , God . Bob , I 'm afraid we 've lost the magic . This conversation sounds like it could affect the entire course of our marriage . Let me just check the phone messages , then we 'll give it our full attention . Hello , Oblong . Dr. Hofschneider here . What 's 3 feet tall and has sex ? You , baby . Your two weeks are up . Enjoy . - Pickles , we 're back in business . - l 'm sorry , Bob . I can 't share a bed with you if that 's the only thing we have in common . Oh , Bob , our entire marriage is a sham . - l think one of us should leave . - Leave ? Pickles- - Bob , please. I just need some time to think . - Please go . - But it 's dark out . I 'll be eaten by the neighborhood dogs in minutes . - Then I 'll leave . - No , no , I 'm the man. I 'll risk it . - Sweetie , the Lipmans ' beagle is out there . - l 'll go . Pickles , wait . Anita and I talked , we held hands and then we kissed . Except for this mysterious whisker burn , it was perfect . You wake up one day , and the love of your life decides you have nothing in common , leaving you alone in the dark shivering , covered with beagle bites . Yeah , anyway , back to me . I 'm thinking of proposing to Anita . Maybe you can give me some marriage advice . Sure . Never let a stripper clog-dance near your dingle . Are there two G 's in " dingle " ? Consuela , how do you say , " You 're not cleaning mi casa bueno enough " ? There is el spot-o on el floor-o . Mrs. Klimer , my name is Kathy. I 'm from Ohio . Pickles. lf you come around the back , I 'll give you food , but no money . Pristine , we used to be friends . I was hoping maybe we could talk . Of course . Come in . Have you been crying , or are you just high ? A little bit of both . When things look their darkest , and I 'm not sure there 's a reason to go on ... - ... there 's always one person I turn to . - Jesus ? Yes , but he pronounces it " Jesus . " He 's the best facialist in Hill Valley . As you know , yesterday we were savagely attacked by the Oak Street clubhouse who bombarded us with soggy lumps of toilet paper . It was a day that will live in infamy . Our counterattack must be swift and merciless . I therefore propose we go after them with dog doo on a stick . - Milo , I want you to scout for ammo . - Elephant popcorn wing nut ... . Chaka Khan . Chaka Khan . Get ahold of yourself . This is war , man . I 'm sorry. I haven 't slept in weeks . Maybe white noise would help . You should get a wave machine . White noise . Wave machine . And if that doesn 't work , try counting your blessings , like I do . Blessing one : My clothes are made of Gore-Tex . Blessing two : I 'm starting to bud . White noise . White noise . White noise . White noise . White noise . White noise . This stuff really itches . You think that 's bad , wait till we get to the ass wax . - So trouble in the marriage ? - How did you know ? I knew it would never work between you and Bob . You 're from two different worlds , not like George and me . We 're a perfect match . This is so great. I 've never been to a real dive before . Dive ? This is the best restaurant in the valley . My mother ate here every day when she was pregnant with me . You are so cute . Pickles , we 've been looking all over for you . We saw you leave with that impoverished little worm . Pristine , it 's right there . Pickles , get in the car . We 're going back to the hills . No , I 'm staying . I 'm happy when I 'm with Bobby-o . It 's actually just Bobby . The kids added the " O. " Just shut up . You 're making a big mistake , Pickles . You 'll be sorry . I like your friends . Hi , George. I got your fax about dinner tonight . - Sorry , dear , no can do . - Fine . We 'll reschedule for April . - Love to our child . - You mean both of them ? - Right , there 's a boy and a girl . - Ciao . Gosh , I 'm fond of that man . See , you and Bob could never have a relationship like this . You know what , Pristine ? You 're right . White noise . White noise . White noise . Dude , eating an entire turkey in bed was a great idea . - Yeah , but won 't it make us sleepy ? - Not unless we hear some white noise . - Capping . Oblong here . - Hi , Daddy . - Beth , honey , what a nice surprise . - My pants is wet . I 'm sorry . Did you have an accident ? No , it 's from the lots and lots of water that 's filling up the house . Oh , my God . Hang on , sweetie . Pickles , thank God I tracked you down . Your house is flooding , and the children are trapped . - My kids ! - But , madam , your ass wax . Well , I hate to see it go to waste . Honey , you 're gonna need a lot more wax . - Help . - Come on , get me out . Hang on , kids , we 're coming . - l can 't open the door to the kids ' hallway . - Stand back . Stupid old-world craftsmanship . - Help . Help us out ! We need to get out . - We 're gonna drown . Our babies . We 're not gonna lose them . They 're the greatest gift you ever gave me . Bob , that 's it . That 's what we have in common . Our children , our lives , 1 8 wonderful years . - Oh , sweetheart , I love you . - l love you too , Bobby-o . - Help . Help us ! - We 're gonna drown . - What 's all that racket ? - The kids are drowning , baby . Boys , I think we got enough water here . Out of my way . They 're saved . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? Well , as long as the kids are gonna be okay . Oh , God . Oh , God . Jiminy cricket . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

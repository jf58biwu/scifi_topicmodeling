 Just keep going follow the nexus coordinates . But we 've been following them for three solar days . Just follow them , Pilot or do I have to take over manual command ? Zhaan , maybe ... Go away , Crichton ! All right , look , we 've all been talking . We think maybe we should turn back . when Stark communicated with me , he insisted that we follow the nexus coordinates . If I do what he says , he will be there . There 's nothing out there , okay ? Aeryn has gone and done the long - range recon ... We should return to the slave auction immediately ! And do what ? We have no currency , D 'Argo . We cannot save your son . But we can save Stark . Zhaan , maybe , uh ... What ? Well , maybe I 'm . . I 'm just saying maybe . . you didn 't communicate with Stark . You know , Zhaan , sometimes when we want something really badly we think things happen when they don 't . I do not need a lesson from you , child . This mask talked to me . . unless you all think I 'm imagining it . I do . Stark is gone but my son is still alive . So I want you to turn this ship around . Crichton , do you also believe I am imagining my communication with Stark ? Bluie , since we 've been together ... you 've shown me some pretty wacky things but it 's been three days , and D 'Argo 's son is . . Don 't give up ... Don 't stop , Zhaan . Hurry . I 'm dying . Moya 's found something . There 's a ship directly in front of us . Stark . Moya 's sensors are picking up one being . Maneuver close and deploy the docking web . The life is faint , Crichton . We have to reach him quickly . He 's barely breathing . This is impossible . We saw him die . Well , let 's get him to Zhaan before he dies again . D 'Argo ! D 'Argo , I 've done it . I 've found it . I know how to save your son . It 's all here D 'Argo ... everything , everything . Be calm , Stark , be calm . What is this dren ? How will it help me save my son ? I 've got a plan- - a plan . Shh ! Stark , your life signs are still weak . Just let him talk . Hang on . Before we hear about any plan , inquiring minds want to know , how the hell did you get here ? I stole a ship . No , on the hubcap- - you were executed ... you were dispersed . Crichton , this body is only a . . a molecular creation , which enables me to live in your realm . It 's merely a . . a vessel for my true incorporeal self . You want to run that by me one more time ? When I dispersed , I instantly traveled to locate these plans and blueprints , and then I. . I reconstituted the shell of this body , and ... and stole a ship to come find you . I told you he was still alive . I don 't believe it . Zhaan was telling the truth , I ... Go on , Stark . Ka D 'Argo , your son is being sold in a lot of 10,000 slaves . Now this is a blueprint for a depository . What , you mean like a bank ? Are we going to rob a bank ? Steal other people 's currency to help ourselves ? We - We can 't do that , I can 't . Well , sure you can . Zhaan , it is not a normal depository . It is one that services only criminals who wish to hide what they have stolen from others . Wait a microt . Are you talking about a shadow depository ? Yes , and it 's within the range of a transport pod from here . Hmm , so you are insane . Well , I saw a shadow depository once that had more firepower than a Gammak Base . Yes , but with these , I can control the internal depository door motion detectors . And these . . These are a complete set of blueprints - vault layout , everything . In one container is enough wealth to buy the entire shipment of slaves and still have enough left over to make all of us filthy rich forever ! Where did you get these ? I helped the deposit designer cross over to death . His last thoughts led me to these . They 're genuine . Did you kill him ? Not exactly . Did the designer have enough time to explain to you how much firepower is actually inside this depository ? Not ... Not precisely . Oh , that 's comforting . We 're going to have to go down and have a look for ourselves . Their arsenal would be massive . This is suicide , D 'Argo . Well , it 's the only way we can save my son . We must consider it . D 'Argo , wait . No , no , no . I know this is important . I know you want to do this- - but it 's not possible . You won 't even consider this ? I just don 't see how we ... Well , fine , we 'll go without you . We 'll go without all four of you . Chiana , it 's just you , me and Stark . Well , sure , Bubba , but you know , maybe ... maybe we should just ... What ? You 're against me , too ? No , no , I 'm with you . It 's ... When you ask me to do something did I ever question if it was possible ? D 'Argo , I ... No , I didn 't . You 're cowards , all of you . He does not need my permission . Get him on the phone ! He is not responding to any of my signals . D 'Argo ! How much of a head start does he have ? He cleared Moya not more than 50 microts ago . D 'Argo , pick up the damn phone . I know you can hear me . D 'Argo ? We 're taking the prowler . That 's big . That 's very big . I suggest you take it , or your business will be no longer appreciated . Don 't threaten me , Natira . John ... there 's D 'Argo And don 't forget who I am . I haven 't . You 're nobody here . But do as I say , and we 'll let the relationship unfold . Just , um ... What ? Scorpius . Where ? Over there , talking to that weird , blue alien . That 's not Scorpius . You 're having visions again . Have a look . ... and regardless ... that should be the least of your worries ... See ? Sorry about that . And we 're worried about D 'Argo . Hand over your weapons ... Slowly . What is your business here , Peacekeepers ? Good . Very , very good . You 're in charge here ? What is your business ? This is a depository , right ? We have something to deposit . What makes you think we 'd be interested ? You ever hear of K. F. C. ? K. F. C. ? It is , to my knowledge , unique in the universe and unique is always valuable . Now ... we have managed to procure all 11 secret ingredients ... . What we need to do now ... is discuss the terms of- - Security breach , portal five ! Guards ! The Luxan ! Seize him ! Piss ! Get him on the ground . On the ground . On the ground . Hold him ! Wait . I was told the security here was weak . What for ? I was right . The security here is frelled ! Silence ! As a race Luxans can be in - artful at love inadequate at war , and intrinsically inept , but this one . . is intelligent . Shall I execute him ? No . He also expects to be interrogated don 't you ... ? See ? It 's a dance , gentlemen . Let 's not disappoint him . You went to so much trouble to open that door , Ka D 'Argo ... be my guest . It 's time to go . Aeryn . You ! You set him up ! D 'Argo is down there ... because of you ! Look , you left him no choice ! He had to , had to . It 's the only way to save Jothee . It 's the plan ! What plan ? What are you talking about ? The plan , the plan to get D 'Argo back and to rob the depository . But you put the whole place on security alert ! It 's all part of the plan , you see ? Because D 'Argo 's breached the system they 'll scramble their codes and while they 're resetting their security codes I can link in and they 'll never even know . . ... but I have to work quickly . So you 'll leave me alone ! I 've only got six arns before they reset their codes . How ' bout I reset his codes ? How the hell are we supposed to get D 'Argo back ? Don 't worry about a thing . I 've got it all figured out . It 's all part of the plan . You better have it all figured out . D 'Argo bet his life on that . No , he bet his son 's life on that . You manipulated us . This plan ... will work . He hasn 't said a word . He 's Luxan he 'll die first . Which means all this pain has been for nothing as it will continue to be . . but perhaps you like pain . Is that it ? I hope so . I 've changed my mind . 7 % isn 't nearly enough . I want ten . Listen , slug , you 'll get what we agreed upon and you 'll be happy about it , okay ? It 's easy , Rygel . Now , Stark 's gadget will switch our container for the valuable one . And no comms . What ? All transmissions will be detected . But what if something goes wrong ? We have complete confidence in you , Rygel especially where money is concerned . Chiana , swallow this . It will protect you from the effects of the melar gas . You ready , Rygel ? Do I look ready ? You have nothing to fear . The gas will suspend your biological functions just long enough to avoid being detected by a bioscan . Goddess be with you . Brave , Rygel . 10 % , do you hear me ? Ten ! I consider this an oral con ... Strange , it should have been instantaneous . I 'll have to adjust the mix next time . No , no , no ! Wrong chip ! Bad chip ! Bad ! Have you accessed their security systems yet ? Soon . You said we had less than six arns . I know what I said . That means you have less than an arn left . All bad . It 's a matter of precision and timing . I must create my link at the precise moment they reset the . . We 're in . I 'm in . Are you sure this is going to work ? Yes , it 'll work . I spent too much time thinking it through . I spent too much time thinking through the Farscape Project . Your side , my side ! My side , your side ! Now go away . You know ... go back to your quarters . Get something to eat , take a nap . Do nothing . That 's what D 'Argo said you do best . Ground rules Did D 'Argo say that ? No . I 'm sorry ... He didn 't . Do you have any other lies . . . you want to confess ? You want to guilt trip me , that 's fine . Just ... don 't lie to me . Good . Good . This is it ? Lame . We can do better . Better is whatever I say it is . I knew that . May I help you ? No . Bring me who ever is in charge here . I assure you , madam , I am more than capable ... Don 't elevate yourself . I know a functionary when one crawls in front of my face . Now fetch me your master like a good little minion . I 'm Natira . Are you here to make a transaction ? I am Aralla . You act as if that name should mean something to me . I understand you 've been having security problems . You 've been misinformed . Oh really ? I had one of my operatives test your systems himself . He got halfway into your vault before you even noticed him . The Luxan ? He barely made it through the first door . He belongs to you ? He 's still alive ? Last I checked . They couldn 't even kill a Luxan . Unbelievable . I will take him back now . You 'll take whatever I give you . How did he get our code ? It is not my job to plug your security leak . Then why have you come here ? Time - sensitive goods . Short - term deposit . " Short term . " I need storage for one solar day . " One solar day . " Explosives Biologicals Power - field emitters Hynerian ? Yes . Neltoth era . Hmm , it 's extremely ugly . But priceless . And now my Luxan . This way , please . Girl ? Yes ? Take him back to the ship . At once , Aralla . Freakin ' attila the hun . Your guards can watch you from the observation room . He looks bad . Those are my rules , and if you don 't like them then leave ... Now . The vault is made from madium steel strong enough to withstand a metevec explosion . Does that alleviate your security concerns ? I 'll let you know in one solar day . Please . The code to your container is now linked to your genetic profile . Only you will be able to gain access . Here comes your container now . The first time can be a little intimidating . 'Bonnie and Clyde ' . Oh , no , forget about that one- - it was a bad ending . Scorpius is here . Natira should know . You know , it 's really not very nice to whisper . All right , Zhaan , come on , come on , wrap it up . " You can 't escape me . You know that " Not now , you freak . Get out of my head . " You can 't escape me " Yes , Scorpius . No ... Scorpius . You see him ? This is bad . This is very bad . Scorpius ... Scorpius ... Don 't talk . I 've come for my property . If you could just ... be a little patient . No ! No , no , no , no . I must see Natira now . Yes , but ... You 're stalling me , Akkor . No . He 's about to walk in on Zhaan . We better warn her . We can 't use the comms , because they 'll hear us . She 'll be right with you . Please understand . Natira 's policy on client confidentiality is very strict . I could lose my position . Of course . Oh , I understand . Now it won 't be your fault . ... All right . Hold still . What is that ? My boy Scorpius . He 's half Scarran ; got a hell of a heat problem . That must be how he stays cool . I trust your machinery will not damage my possessions . Come on , Zhaan , quit your yakking and get out of there . Come on , Zhaan . We currently store items far more fragile and valuable than yours . Scorpius is here . If you 'd allow my assistant to escort you ... Natira ... Scorpius ... How good to see you . Follow me . I 'm here to claim my property . Is that it ? Straight to business ? Scorpius . . For a half - scarran you can sometimes be so . . Cold . We have so much to catch up on . I heard about the destruction of your Gammak Base . And you thought I was dead . Well , I 'm glad I was wrong . You 've seized my property . Well ... Of course ... But I 'll provide you with merchandise of equal value . No , for my inconvenience , you 'll provide me ... With triple the value . Double . Triple . I 'll make the arrangements . Hey , Stark , riddle me this ... What 's black and white and black and white and black and white , and black and white ... Scorpius ! ? and in the bank ? Here ? You knew ! You knew that he had a safe - deposit box in that bank ! Uh - uh ! We 've talked about lying . Yes , I knew , but if I told you ... Hell ! We would have stayed the hell away from the bank ! What the hell were you thinking ? I didn 't know he 'd be here . You just want to . . You want to boost ! Boost ! Boost his stuff ! You just wanted revenge ! That is not true ! My people and D 'Argo 's son are the reason I 'm here . Now , if it 's Scorpius ' wealth that frees them , well , that 's an added bonus . You want revenge . No , I don 't . I want to kill him . That 's justice . How 's D 'Argo ? Recovering . Pilot , is there any sign of Scorpius 's command carrier ? None ... But Moya did sense one small vessel approaching the planet earlier . Oh , that 's fine . That 's probably just a marauder on a stealth trajectory . There 's no need to panic . We can still pull this off undetected . Look . . I 've modified these comms so that they 'll encrypt all transmissions we can communicate safely at all times and this passkey has been calibrated to control all their doors . You see . This plan will work . In any event ... we 're committed . I need one more thing . Can you concoct something for me that reacts with heat , and by " react " I mean " explode " ? I can ... Prepare some jelifan paste . Do that , please . Don 't turn this into a vendetta , John . I didn 't . I 'm procuring a quarter sackmar of Borinium ingots for you at least three times the value of the property you had stored . And where are you stealing them from ? Do you care ? No . How soon will we have them ? The arrangements are rather complex . And what am I supposed to do while I wait ? Accept my apologies . Return to the marauder . I will summon you if I need you . Leave that . Natira will tend to me . . Should I require it . True . I know many ways to bleed off your excess heat . How you doing ? How do I look ? You look like crap . Well , that is your answer . Blood 's clear . Not much damage . He 's still in a lot of pain , though . Yeah , we 're , uh ... We 're going ahead with the plan . Because now it 's begun , you have no other choice . Now , who exactly got us into this great plan , anyway ? Well , someone had to act . You mean someone had to take matters into their own hands ? What ? And you never do ? Crichton , just - just leave him alone , okay ? No , that 's fine . He wants to get into it ; we can get into it . Oh , yeah , sure . Now 's just a great time . Hey , how about I just go grab some brags in case he starts bleeding again . I didn 't come here to fight . I came to see how you are . Well ... we 've already covered that . Is there anything else ? One Use gadget to retrieve prize . Three Frell ! The blue bitch said this would be easy ! Withdraw your possessions already ? That 's unusual . My life is unusual . Very unusual . I said this was a short - term deposit . " Short - term . " No Dominar should have to work this hard ! All right , let 's see if this thing actually works . So far , we 're right on schedule . Let 's hope Rygel is . All he 's got to do is switch containers . He gets it right , I got one big kiss for him . What are you doing ? Doing what guys do best . I 'm looking for Baywatch . Better yet- - the Discovery Channel . Are you still angry with me ? Mm ... Furious . Good . It adds enthusiasm to our encounters . Leave the coolant rods . Leave the coolant rods . Leave them . Perfect ! Come on ! Crichton ... Let 's go . Retrieving container . " Hello , John " Go ! Go away . You , move that over there . Careful . Go away . Go ! " I cannot let you do this . " Go 'way , go 'way ! It 's just Scorpius . He 's in my ear . How about some jelifan paste ... " Put it down " In his ear ? " Stop it . Stop it- - Put it down- - " Get out ! I can do ... I can do this ! " No , John , I won 't let you ... " No , you can 't . Give it to me . Come on , Aeryn . Come on , come on , come on , come on . Get down . The Borinium ingots have been transferred into your container . You 'll be pleased with their value . I 'd better be similarly pleased . . . With their quantity . I will not be late for my Talenting tea . You want to push ? We 'll be aboard the transport shortly , Aralla . Borinium ingots ? The Delvian woman . These are her possessions . A Delvian ? Security lockdown . Who was with her ? A Nebari , a Luxan and two Sebaceans . Crichton ! Seal all exits ! Time to try Stark 's lockpick . No- - time to try something else . Get away from the portal . The doors are still sealed , Aeryn . What 's happening ? Scorpius must be on to us . Stupid plan . Very stupid plan . Don 't panic , hold ... Do we have a choice ? Stark , Stark , pick up ! I want him captured , not deafened ! This facility is bristial tight . They won 't get out . I have less than a scarag of faith in your words , Natira . Locate them now . This wasn 't supposed to happen . Wasn 't supposed to happen . Well , it did ! Now , can you pinpoint our location and turn off the damn camera ? I 'm here . What the frell ? They 're jamming the cameras ! Give me your level , corridor , segment , in that order . ... this gizmo you gave me it 's supposed to give me control over all the doors ! Yes . Yes , but they 'll know right where you are . It 's best to let me ... Just- - give me control ! Stark , just . . you and D 'Argo get Zhaan , Chiana and Rygel out and we 'll act as a diversion . That is suicide , Aeryn . Almost as suicidal as strolling in and walking through a security door . Camera function restored . A portal 's been breached . Level 19 . Is it Crichton ? We can 't be sure until we run a- - Make sure ! " Stop running ... stop running ... " Stop it ! " You cannot resist ! " What is the matter with you ? What is wrong ? Aeryn . Scorpy ... when he put me in his chair . . . he did something , and it 's getting worse . Guards . Oh , hell ... got an idea . Take your first on ... the right . Ten percent of this plan is lunacy . 50 % of these riches is not enough . 100 % of dead is dead ! Stark , which way now ? D 'Argo , are you there ? Stark , they need you . If you fail them , I 'll kill you . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . This will work . Trust me . We just- - This will never work . have to find a place to ... get our clothes off . You two , hold it ! They went that way ! Portal Riga , Segment Trident Five . They must be overriding portal controls . Not possible . Notify me constantly of their progress . This is my facility , Scorpius . You go nowhere without me . Nati ... Natira ... How much do you owe me ? In every way ? Too much ... that I cannot repay . If I leave with this man in custody ... then all is forgiven . Blue , how you doing ? We 're almost to the central processing area , John . Stark , open the last door . No plan , no plan , no plan My fault , my fault , my fault . They 're almost out of there . Come on , you can do it . Stark , Stark , open the door . I can hear them coming . " John . John , I need you ... " What ? If Scor - plus gets me ... I know , sh - shoot you . No ! No , no , no , shoot him . Look , we have to talk . Not here . You 'll get us both killed . Aeryn , I have to tell you how I feel . I have to tell you ... No , you don 't . Yes , I do . No ... you don 't . Natira , report . Crichton 's heading towards the main chamber . Your current vector will intercept him . The Delvian still has the special reserve you intended for Scorpius . Good luck to her . The least of our worries . They 're coming , D 'Argo . Hurry ! I am working on it . Just frelling hurry . Chiana , take your pill for the melar gas . Take it now . Where 's my pill ? This time I get a pill . We have to reach them quickly . I 'm following ... the frelling sequence ! That 's it , D 'Argo ! You are back in their system . No pill for Rygel ... of course not . When did anyone think of me ? Stand your ground ! Don 't move ! We 'll shoot if you resist . Don 't think about it . Oh , frell ! Much better . I knew I had to adjust the mix . Crichton 's outracing you to the main chamber ! Move it , Scorpius ! Capture them ! Take Crichton ... alive . We must change your cooling rods . You 're burning through them too fast . Thank the Goddess you made it . Is Rygel dead ? Unconscious . Aeryn ... You help them load . I 'll gonna go seal the doors . No , reverse that , John . You do this , I 'll do that . " John ... there is no ... " ... this is mine ... " ... there is no escape ... " ... load . Come on . Hold it ! Hiya , Braca . Tell me , is the rematch ever better than the original fight ? Hm , hm , hm ? You have no idea how patient I have been for this moment . Since I got you here ... tell me ... what the frell did you put in my head ? Some awareness . A neuro - biotracer . Call it what you like ! A tiny chip ... a tiny seed that 's been growing in your brain . Touching every aspect of your . . personality . Your . . memory . Didn 't happen to see Luanne Johnson , did ya ? And whispering advice . I trust . . it 's helped save you once or twice since escaping my Gammak Base . What 's the matter , Scorpy ? You don 't look too good . Neither do you , Crichton . Well ... I got a piece of you in me . Now you got a piece of me in you ! Change it . Change it now ! Scorpius . You cannot let me die any more than I can sacrifice you . That 's what you 're telling me in my head but I think I 'll give it a shot . No , you must save me . No ! Now , take one . Take it . No ! Take it . Take it ! Take it ! Now , insert the rod . No ! Insert it , In - Insert the rod ... in the carriage ! Insert the rod ! Insert it ! Insert it , insert it , insert it , insert it ... Insert the rod ... John ... You 're really not my type . Die , you grotesque bastard ! Even if it means I die , too ! Neither one of us can die ... Oh , say can you see ... ! ! I command you ... to help me . By the dawn 's early light ... ! ! John Crichton ... I command you ... to help me ! What so proudly we hail- - at the twilight 's last gleaming ! Whose broad stripes and bright stars . . through the perilous night ! We 've done it ! We are rich . As soon as we establish an exchange rate for these ingots we 'll know exactly how rich we really are . We agreed , Rygel . Nothing gets touched until after D 'Argo 's son and the others get freed from the slave auction , right ? Yes , yes , let 's all pretend we 're not thinking how ill advised that covenant was . He provides a perspective otherwise lacking . I must apologize for my panic . My shame is great . You did brilliantly . We wouldn 't have had a chance without you . For which I am eternally grateful . Ka D 'Argo ... You 've proven yourself to be a worthy friend and one not to be distrusted again . Nice sentiment . After all these desolate cycles I 'm about to see my son , and that tortured being there is the one who has made it possible . What about your other tortured friend ? Friends support one another unconditionally . They also forgive one another . It was real . I didn 't imagine it . What was real , John ? I have Scorpius in my head . And it was hard letting him die . There 's still a part of me that wishes I 'd saved him . Well , you mustn 't forget what he wanted from you . He wanted to dissect your brain . Aeryn , I , um ... I meant ... what I said didn 't say . I know .

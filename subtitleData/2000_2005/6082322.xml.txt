 Previously on Farscape ... We all knew the time would come when we would split up . - I 'm coming with you . - No . I 'm sorry . Aeryn ... is ... with child . Commander ! Stay clear ! We 're being torn ... I suggest you aim that behind you . The creatures following me execute on sight . Chiana . Hey ! Nice to see ya . And you haven 't seen Moya ? If an officer superior to you ordered it , I would summarily execute you without hesitation . So says every one of your psychological evaluations ... Captain Braca . Grayza is a manipulator ! I understand you no longer have a ship to command . We would like to repay our debt . You don 't owe us ... anything . Nevertheless , if we are able , you shall arrive at the planet you think your friends may be . And now , on Farscape ... That do it ? Elack senses a planet ... but the erratic weather patterns are interferring . Oh , frell ! Sparky ! Can you fix ... scan ? I 'm trying . Come here and hold this . Hold ' em yourself . Crichton ... why are we searching for this planet ? Arnessk is uninhabitable . No . Jool told us every few cycles the magnetics drop low enough for the dig team to remain there for a while . Help me ! My hand is still too weak . Yah , right . Pull the other one and I 'll whistle " Falle Loosen " . No life forms are registering on Elack 's sensors , but ... but I ... I 'm so weak I ... I ... I cannot be sure . Shhh . Rest . You rest , sweetheart . We 're gonna go check it out . Hey , Crichton . Don 't go done without me . I don 't want to be here when Psycho zapps the final zolk . I don 't see anyone . You see anyone ? No ! What 's the matter ? Just got a feeling . Whoa . Is that a feeling feeling or ... Just a feeling . Okay . Okay , now I 'm getting a feeling . You 're not getting a feeling ? No . No feelings . Hang on . Take this , take this ... - while I check on this load . - Right . Then again ... I might have had a feeling . Get back . Peacekeeper , drop your weapon . That 's a common mistake . I 'm not a Peacekeeper . Drop your weapon or the female dies . He 's not a Peacekeeper . Wait ! Tarnat ! Stop ! You 're breakin my back . Let go . - It 's you ! - Look at you ! Yep , it 's really me , Princess . Who is this Peacekeeper ? And why is he with the tralk ? - She 's not a tralk . - He 's not a Peacekeeper . Forgive Tarnat . He 's new security here and he 's just a little ... gung ... ho ... about protecting the dig . You 've been warned . There are races that would kill for what we 've discovered . Tarnat . These are my friends . So , are Aeryn and Rygel with you ? Rygel , yah . Aeryn we haven 't heard from . Has she contacted you ? No , not yet . But ... you know , she will . ... right . Is ... is Moya here ? We didn 't detect her when we came aboard . No ! ... look for Aeryn , you know what ? You 've got to come with me I don 't think the instructor would want that ... Tarnat . Just put it back in your pants and calm ... down . Cheer up , John . I have a lot to tell you about my travels . Can you believe it ? We 're here . We 're here and we 're alive ... and nobody is trying to kill us ! Ahh ! Come on ! Subtitles : PK SUB-66 Check this out . This is the most important planet in the Universe ! Jool , Moya got spat out like a furball . How the hell does that happen ? Stop ! That 's all I remember . Please ! D 'Argo 's gone to find the weird old lady and she 'll explain what happened . She spoke to Pilot for arns . Okay ? These sensors ... are for the magnetics . When it 's blue , the levels are safe . Red is bad . Red means : don 't pack , fly . But this ... This is what I was talking about . This is the greatest archeological discovery of the last one thousand cycles ! This ? Yah . I mean , it may not look like much to the untrained eye ... My eye 's okay , Princess . Hey ? Is that valuable ? I 'm not sure , but I 'll run some tests and check ... Nice arm . What are you doing ? Fantastic as this is , I 'll take the tour later . - What is her problem ? What did I do ? - Nothing . You did nothing . She just had a rough time away from Moya . Jool , if it 's alright , I 'm gonna find Grandma . No , no , no ! Stay here . D 'Argo 's getting her . Please just wait here and let me show you all this ? Please ? Please ? D 'Argo ? Wrinkles ? - It 's remarkable , isn 't it ? - You scared me . I don 't know . We better go find Wrinkles . I was ... I couldn 't find her down by the cliffs so I thought she might 've come here . It 's ... it 's good to see you again , Chi . Twelve thousand cycles ago , Arnesskan priests worshipped . Mystics . Somehow they maintained a truce with the Scarrans and the Peacekeepers for five hundred generations . Imagine . Imagine if we could discover their secret for peace . No one knows how they achieved it because ... one day they just vanished . And it 's like everyone just left ... in a microt ... and no one knows why . I know why . This is Instructor Vella . You 're John Crichton . Yes . Tarnat said I 'd find you here . I see why he mistook you for Sebecean . Same size , weight , coloring . Though the brain cavity appears smaller . Yah , but my choppers are first class , and I do an excellent turn my head and cough . What ? I see you 're not interested in any of this . I just have some unfinished business to attend to . This is more fascinating than any business you might have . Believe it or not , this planet was once a paradise . Virgin water , panoply of life forms . Three of these probes , which form the Darnaz Triangle , were launched by enemies of peace . They created magnetic summers that killed the priests and drove civilization away . You understanding any of this ? Well , I missed a couple of big words , so maybe I should just ... tsk ... tsk ... tsk ... tsk ... Instructor Vella has found two of the probes . Legend has it , if I find the third probe , I can reverse its damage . ... and so reactivate the Darnaz Triangle . Jool started to drive you crazy yet ? She ... she just keeps going on and on about this place . Well , it , uh ... can be like an obsession . We 've been working from dawn til dusk . You and the Princess ? You and the Princess ... Did the Peacekeepers ... capture you and ... and ... and steal your brain and replace it with whatever you 're using now ? What 's the matter ? They were always this far away from getting me , and they didn 't get you ? LoLah hid me . Lola ? LoLah . Your ship can disappear ... For a short time . And you named her LoLah . It 's short for Lolan . In memory of my wife . Ryg ... D 'Argo and Jool are here and D 'Argo 's got his ship back . They expect that Moya 's gonna be back sometime soon . Well , she 'd better hurry . I can barely hear you and the heat 's knackered in here . Crichton , this Leviathan is dying . We 've got to get off it soon . Were you still talking ? Sorry . Connect me back to Crichton ! Cannot do it . External comms are dead . This ship is entering termination shutdown . In case we need it in a few arns ... I want to get this module started . Pilot of Moya ... Crichton and the others are here on Arnessk . Their presence is a source of irritation . Retrieve them now , or we 'll have to take our own steps . We intercepted this transmission to Moya sixty microds ago . You were right . They did follow the Interion to the planet . How long will it take for our Command Carrier to get there ? Ten arns . Make it five ... Captain . But first ... come and see this . I find your amateur attempts at ... torture ... to be quite pleasurable . I could resist it for cycles . Maybe you can ... or maybe you can 't . But this rod will make it a little more difficult . Don 't do this , Braca . I made you . No ... I made you . I think now you will finally tell me ... all you know about John Crichton . I told you everything about John Crichton ! No , Scorpius . You hold onto secrets because you fear that when you finally do tell me everything ... you will die . And you 're probably right . Grandma ! ... response when I told him about the Darnaz Triangle . - I still don 't trust Crichton . - ... has no interest in it . Well , don 't worry , it will be over soon . Our last vector test will reveal the third probe . Oh , damn ! Grandma . Damn ! The Creature from the Black Lagoon ... sorta . Grandma , how 're ya doin ? You remember me ? Me Crichton ... you Grandma . Get away , Oo-Nii . Go on , scat . Go on , go on , scat . Go on . I remember . You 're hooman . Right . Crichton ! Oh , ah , damn . You need a bath . Never bathe , never bathe . Not your head . It washes off the juice . That 's ... more than I want to know . Listen , Jool said ... that you guys got spat out of a wormhole . She said that only you knew what happened . Ask Pilot . Pilot knows . I talked to Pilot . - But now Pilot knows what ? - No , no , no . Ask him . I must follow Vella . Hey ! I need to know about what ... How old are you ? How old ? I am 293 cycles . Anytime there is goodness , it will be destroyed by ... by a cause . By Vella . Yes , yes , this is who it will end ... Yes ! Oh , no . I won 't let Vella have any of it . It 's the voices . They scream to me . The Darnaz Triangle must never be used again ! I don 't hear ... your voices . Back off . Get back . Go on , get back . I 'm not ... interested in your voices . You know what I 'm interested in . Aeryn 's child . You pierced my subliminal message . Yah . And I might 've stopped her if I 'd known sooner . Why would you want to stop her ? She 's carrying my child . Well , my DNA . I didn 't keep that secret from you , she did . I just wanted you to accept Aeryn 's decision . But now , I can help you forget . Lakah . It 's all over planet . Squeeze the juice meat out of it and stick it up your nose . You 'll get a jolt out of it and Wham ! and for 500 microts , nothing bothers you . No think of Aeryn . Nothing . - Get that thing away from me . - Okay . Away , away . Ask Vella ... If all the priests died here , why are there no bones ? Why are there no bones ? Do you feel that ? Just let the tug of energy tell you how fast you need to work . Now I guess ... that now Crichton 's back ... you 'll head off with him again soon . Yah . No , I mean ... perhaps . Being here I 've ... I 've really enjoyed it . Yah ? Yah . You know , I think we 've really found something here . We should , ah ... clean it up and show to Vella . Stick it up her nose . It 's a prayer wheel . Found on every wall in the site . And it would never fit up my nose . Yah , well I didn 't actually mean that I ... Now ... why are you using that ? Well , for this ... In unskilled hands , a carver can be perilous . You see , Luxan ... the process that strips away cycles of age , when it hits living flesh ... absorbs the molecular signature of whatever it touches . Thus , that Lakah is now rock . Magnetic pulses surrounding the planet make it impossible for the Command Carrier to land . But Mauraders with less sophisticated electronics can make it through . How much longer will the dig site remain habitable ? Forty to fifty arns . Closer . Well , that 's Chief Scientist Taylik 's best estimation , Ma 'am . No , you ... closer . Down . On your knees . Are there any other vessels near the planet ? Just a dead Leviathan in decayed orbit . I am prepping a squadron now . Closer . Closer ! Braca ? Does it bother you ... what has happened to Scorpius ? No . We won 't need a squadron . We 'll go to the planet together . You and me ... Three mauraders , twenty soldiers ... Wh ... wh ... why ... ca ... ye ... I always assumed John Crichton was just an outlaw . An excuse for Scorpius ' mistakes . But he destroyed a Command Carrier . The Scarrans desire him . Perhaps ... somehow ... I can use him . Perhaps ... Scorpius ' enemy ... will be my friend . Grave robbers leave snares . This has been opened . Here . Make certain you turn your face away and open it . Just a primitive jarnice flash . Only if it hits your eyes will it cause damage . You 're brave and listen well . Do you plan to keep studying when we leave the dig ? If I 'm allowed , yes . And the Luxan ? He is ... he 's my friend . But not your equal ! Intellectually , Luxans are a sub-species . He will make mistakes ... and you will be blamed for them . I know ... Crichton ! He 's arrested me ! Shoot him ! Hey , yo , yo , hey ! No need ... no need for guns . The old lady told me how you plan to stop us . I didn 't plan to do any ... He 's one of the defilers . They lie . They will not use the probes for good . - Kill him . - No . Vella may not fear you , but I know you 're their leader . I 've heard about you . Get him , Crichton . I helped you . I showed you Aeryn . You didn 't show me squat . Sit . Just sit . Listen to me . I don 't even know this old lady 's name . She came onboard our ship like a really bad smell that won 't go away . I 'm not a threat to you . I just want Moya to come back , so I can get the hell outta here . That 's it . Except one thing . Do not point guns at people . That 's right ! Hit him again . No ! Oh , go on Crichton . Let me show you . Like this . And ... See ? What the hell are you doing ? What ... why are you telling me to shoot people ? Cause you have to . Vella will take the Darnaz probes and use them as a weapon . Why do you think she sent the rest of the dig team away ? I have no idea . There was peace here once . You must see what was lost here . I can 't let this happen anywhere else . - Would you ... - Arrgh ! Damn ! No ! See ... See the ancient world . See ... See ... what I see . The children 's tiles . The peaceful thread within us all . It started ... here . See ... See the Darnaz probes . See it all . I saw priests . A ... a ... and a goat . Probes ... falling from the sky . I saw where they landed . Like a wormhole ... back to the past . See ... See the peace . Now ... sleep ... sleep , Crichton . Crichton , wait , wait ! I just had to wake you . Wait . Wait Crichton . Stop . I 'm not going to hurt you . Hell . Scared the hell outta me . Thought you were ... a sea monster , creature , critter , somethin . What 's with this weather ? I musta been out for a long time . Not long . You must stop old woman . Oh , just let me ... clear the anti-freeze outta my head . Vella ! She has found the third probe . It 's still under the ground . Your old lady , she swears she will kill Vella so she cannot use it as a weapon . Nah , nah , nah , she 's ... she 's just nuts . She 's not gonna do anything . She ... she take your gun . Granny ! - W ... who ? Who is there ? - It 's all right . There 's no one here . No one at all . Hey ! Hey , what are you doing ? Why didn 't you stand up for me ? D 'Argo ... most Interions think Luxans are inferior . That 's just the way it is . What do you think ? Don 't ask me that . What do you think ? I think ... that you 're unusual for a Luxan . Yah . Yah , I am that . Sikozu ! Have you finished with that module ? Sikozu ! D 'Argo , you can 't blame Vella if she thinks she 's smarter than you . No , but I can blame you . I never believed that any of you ... cared what I thought . I care . And just so you know , if someone had criticized you , or insulted you , called you a stuck up , arrogant little Princess , I 'd have defended you . Granny ? Granny ! Granny , I just want Winona so I can get the hell outta here . Receive the spirit . Granny ! Granny ... Must stop Vella . Won 't let her destroy another world . The carver . Have to protect . The voices . The voices say ... don 't let them use it . Don 't let them . Who 's there ? Show yourself ... What are you doing here ? Is this some sort of joke ? No ! Grandma ? Oh , boy . Wha ? What happened here ? Turned my back for like five minutes ... - What 's Laura Croft doin in the wall ? - Shh ! Quiet ! Instructor Vella ... Are you all right ? We saw ... What 're you doing ? Now , don 't say a word . Not ... a word . Receive the spirit ... of Instructor Vella . No matter how selfish , how evil . D 'Argo . You knocked him out . She 's like ... " in " the wall . What happened to the rest of her ? She told me that if the carver hits flesh , it alters the DNA . Nobody cares about the DNA . Why did you knock that guy out ? If he 'd seen me with her , he would have attacked and then he would be dead . I saved his life . Receive ... the spirit ... We 're still missing one person . - Wrinkles ? - Yup . - You think she did this ? She can 't even take a bath . - She 's been acting weird . If you 're planning to escape in that , I 'm going with you . Does all your species have truncated spines ? Don 't play arky-arky with me , and I promise I 'm smarter than you 'll ever be . Then ... you should realize even with the combustion liquid I synthezied , this module would not travel for more than an arn , so ... no . I am not trying to escape in it . - What 's that ? - It 's Peacekeeper code . Three mauraders are heading to the planet . That receiver has never picked up coded transmissions . I know . I modified it . Go to Pilot 's den . Get that hangar door open . Then hide in the neural cluster . That will shield your life signature should the Peacekeepers scan . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to warn the others , so they can hide . You 're lying ! I told you . I would not last more than an arn in this . Now get those doors open . Move ! Then send a secure comm to Moya . Stop her from coming until the Peacekeepers have gone . Do you smell Granny ? No . No ... She 's not here . - It 's weird . - What ? I 've ... I 've been here . Deja-vue . This there . How 's this thing work ? It 's point and click , right ? - Keep it away from me . - Hey , it 's not a problem . Under here there 's something that has , I think , symbols on it , most of them alien , one ... maybe I recognize . Maybe . How did you know that was here ? Holy crap . It 's real . - What is it ? - Child 's tile . You know any of these ? This one 's Interion . That one might be early Sebecean . Never seen the others . What do they mean ? The symbol is peace . Security . Peace . You recognize any of the symbols ? One . Maybe . Egyptian . From my homeworld . Come on . Got a change of plan . Let 's go . Chiana , can you hear me ? Chiana , I 'm prepping for a fly-over to see if I can find the old lady . Chiana , I 'm getting some sort of proximity alarm warning . Can you hear me ? Chiana ? Do you know what this means ? It means there is a link between my world and this one . Somehow , they 're connected . Pip . Peacekeepers . Peacekeepers ! Chiana , if you can hear me , I think the ship 's ... The Peacekeepers already have them . Stop ... the comms . We must come up with a plan . Remember me ? Oh , yah . I remember a couple of things . Tell her to shove it up her tork , Crichton . I can make things easy for you . And to prove my goodwill . Bracca ? He 'll never bother you again . Scorpius . Do anything you want to him . Anything at all . Crichton ... ! No thanks . I don 't think I can come up with anything better than that . What do you want from me ? What I want may not be as bad as you think . You might even like it . What are you doing ? Crichton ? What are you doing ? Wait an arn . Then we 'll meet . Secure the site . Wake up ! Wake ... up ! Awake . What 's the matter ? Peacekeepers . We have to get a secure comm to Moya . Elack 's transmission core is corrupted . Everything 's dying . - I can 't do what ... - No , no ... Pilot . Stay with me . Pilot ! Pilot ! I 'm ... I 'm finished , Dominar . I 'm sorry ... Please ... Pilot . The orbiting Leviathan is empty . At present we 've captured an Interion , a Nebari and an old Traskan . What about the Luxan and the Peacekeeper traitor ? Uh ... nothing . And this ? The magnetics have spiked . According to this , we 've got approximately 20 arns left and under these circumstances , I think we should leave . He 's regaining motor stimulus . Change him . This is for all the times I had to say yes . They 're still here . The two probes are safe . He found a tile ? Yah . The ... the ... then he saw something with that pad on that you hacked him with . - A real tile ? - Yah . That 's what he said . - From the vision . - Oh , no . What ? What 's the matter ? Chi ? Yah ? When we first met ... did you know I was on the run ? Accused of stealing from a Noatian Gem Mine . Okay . We 've all gotta cheer up , okay ? Because you ... are driving me nuts . I stole things from digs , but things that I needed ... to study , to learn more , you understand ? I don 't have a problem with that , Jool . But I never stole from here . There was this legend ... of this glorious temple ... here , that touched the sky . And no one 's ever found a trace of it . And I dreamed of discovering it and ... - now I 'll never discover anything . - Thanks for sharing . No . The priests will help us . You 'll see . You 'll see . Have to get Crichton . Crichton is nelly-whipped ! Give me a distraction and I 'll save us all . All right . Okay , Wrinkles . Follow my lead . Hey ! Minya ! Hey , ahh ... the old lady , she 's ... she 's got a problem ... down below . What do you mean ? She needs to go to the nooly ! Okay , go . Do you like that ? It 's better than what Scorpius used to do . Peace can only be maintained ... if there is sacrifice . Peace . Sacrifice . Do you like that ? Peace . Sacrifice . Whatever you want . Whatever . You can have it . Peace can only be maintained ... if there is sacrifice . Never been real before . What are you doin here , Old Woman ? In the vision I enhanced , you saw a tile , a child 's tile . Yah . Just like the one I found . What did you do to me ? Must be the magnetics . Pushes the vision further . Somehow the suggested turned real . Does Grayza know you saw the Darnaz Probes ? No . Good . I have seen the carnage weapons of mass destruction bring . For Vella to have had one was awful to consider . But the Peacekeepers ... they must never have it , Crichton . Do you know where the final probe landed ? Yah . This is my fault . I wanted only to show you the peace they had achieved . But somehow , I showed you ... what you must not know . No ! ... Again ! The vision I showed you became real . Grayza can never know where the third probe is . You cannot tell her . You must die . Oh , forgive me . Forgive me . No other way . Forgive me . Walk to the cliff . To the cliff go now ! Forgive me . Forgive me . Receive his spirit . Forgive me . Forgive me . Receive the spirit of John Crichton . He has to die . Ohh ! Forgive me . He has to die . Has to . He had to die . He 'll never tell you now . Never .

[ ALL groaning ] What were you thinking ? - What 's happening ? - The whole damn shelf is breaking off ! That 's what 's happening ! JACK : What we have found locked in these ice cores is evidence of a cataclysmic climate shift which occurred around 1 0,000 years ago . The concentration of these natural greenhouse gases in the ice cores indicates that runaway warming pushed Earth into an ice age which lasted two centuries . [ SPEAKING IN ARABIC ] TRANSLATOR : I 'm confused . I thought you were talking about global warming , not an ice age . JACK : Yes , it is a paradox but global warming can trigger a cooling trend . Let me explain . The Northern Hemisphere owes its climate to the North Atlantic Current . Heat from the sun arrives at the equator and is carried north by the ocean . But global warming is melting the polar icecaps and disrupting this flow . Eventually it will shut down . And when that occurs there goes our warm climate . Excuse me . When do you think this could happen , professor ? When ? I don 't know . Maybe in 1 00 years , maybe in 1 000 . But what I do know is that if we do not act soon , our children and grandchildren will have to pay the price . And who 's going to pay the price of the Kyoto Accord ? It would cost the world 's economy hundreds of billions of dollars . With all due respect , Mr. Vice President the cost of doing nothing could be even higher . Our climate is fragile . At the rate we 're burning fossil fuels and polluting the environment the icecaps will soon disappear . Professor Hall our economy is every bit as fragile as the environment . Perhaps you should keep that in mind before making sensationalist claims . Well , the last chunk of ice that broke off was about the size of Rhode lsland . Some people might call that pretty sensational . [ CROWD laughing ] PROTESTORS : Stop global warming ! Stop global warming !

Where was that taken ? Miami . Well , where was I ? I don 't remember that trip . Sam and I went with my sister . You were in Alaska doing research on your doctorate . [ SIGHS ] Remember what he was like when he was that age ? Everything was " one more . " One more bedtime story . One more ride on my shoulders . " One more , Daddy . " Jack . Sam 's on the phone . Line four . - Sam ? - Dad ! JACK : Where are you ? Are you all right ? - l 'm all right . We 're at the Public Library . - lt 's Mom. I 'm so happy you 're okay . SAM : Mom . Can you call Laura and Brian 's parents and tell them we 're all right ? LUCY : Yes , of course . - Sam , what 's that noise ? - Sam ? Sam ? [ gasping ] SAM : What is going on out there , Dad ? Sam . Sam , listen to me . Listen very carefully . Forget what I said about heading south . It 's too late . The storm is gonna get worse . It 'il turn into a massive blizzard with an eye in the center like a huge hurricane . Uh-huh . Only the air will be so cold , you could freeze to death in seconds . LAURA : Sam ? - Well , what should we do ? JACK : Listen to me , son . Do not go outside . Burn what you can to stay warm , and try to wait it out . I will come for you . Do you understand me ? I will come for you . [ GRUNTlNG ] LAURA : Sam ? - Sam , come back ! JACK : Sam ? LUCY : Sam ? JACK : Sam , did you hear me ? Did you hear me ? LUCY : Sam ? - Tell me he 's gonna be okay- - - He 's gonna be all right . He 's gonna be all right , you understand ? [ gasping ] I thought you 'd drowned . Let 's find some dry clothes for you . Come on . Where 'd you store the arctic gear ? You can 't make it to New York , Jack . I 've walked that far before in the snow . FRANK : This is not the same . Jack , this is not the same . Lucy , tell him . I have to do this . I know . SAM : My hands are shak- - - Shaking . - That 's okay . Here . Here . Come here . What are you doing ? I 'm using my body heat to warm you . If we let the blood from your arms and legs rush back to your heart too quickly your heart could fail . [ SAM GASPING ] Where- - ? Where did you learn that ? Some of us were actually paying attention in health class . How are you feeling ? Much better . GOMEZ : Frank told me about Sam . I won 't try to talk you out of going , but there 's something I need first . You have to explain your results to the Administration . - l already tried that , Tom . - l know. lt 'll be different . You 're gonna brief the president directly . CAMPBELL : Is that the last of it ? LAURA : Pretty much . CAMPBELL : Okay . We also found this radio , but I don 't think it works . Let me see it . [ DOG barking ] Buddha , keep quiet . You ain 't even supposed to be in here anyway . [ RUMBLING ] [ METAL SCRAPING ] Come on , guys . Oh , my God . [ GLASS shattering ] The basic rule of storms is they continue until the imbalance that created them is corrected . In this case , we 're talking about a global realignment . This superstorm will last seven to 1 0 days . When it 's over , ice and snow will cover the entire Northern Hemisphere . The ice and snow will reflect sunlight . The Earth 's atmosphere will restabilize with an average temperature close to that of the last ice Age . Well , what can we do about this ? Head as far south as possible . That is not amusing , professor . Where do you suggest they go ? The farther south they go , the safer they 'll be . Texas . Parts of Florida that aren 't flooded . Mexico would be best . Mexico ? Maybe you should stick to science and leave policy to us . GOMEZ : Well , we tried that approach . You didn 't wanna hear about the science when it could have made a difference . What exactly are you proposing , professor ? Evacuate everyone south of that line . What about the people in the North ? I 'm afraid it 's too late for them . If they go outside the storm will kill them . At this point their best chance is to stay inside . Try to ride it out . Pray . What do you think he 'll do ? I don 't know . Jack thanks and good luck . You too . We 're all gonna need it . We can 't evacuate half the country because one scientist thinks the climate is shifting . - Every minute we delay costs lives . - And the other half of the country ? If Professor Hall is right about this storm sending troops north will create more victims . We need to save the people we can right now . We take the same approach in triage on the battlefield . Sometimes it 's necessary to make difficult choices- - I don 't accept abandoning half the country is necessary . Maybe if you listened sooner , it wouldn 't be . Bullshit. lt 's easy for him to suggest this plan . - He 's safely here in Washington . - His son is in Manhattan . I thought you should know before you start questioning his motives . We 're going to follow Hall 's plan . - General . - Sir ? Give the order for the National Guard to evacuate Southern states . pierce : Yes , sir . Vivian get me my wife . [ wind whistling ] [ GENERATOR WHIRRlNG ] dennis : Sorry , mates , but we 're just about out of petrol . simon : Hey . Is there any chance that it 'll run on this ? RAPSON : Are you mad ? That 's a 1 2-year-old Scotch . [ LAUGHS ] Gentlemen . To England . To mankind . To Manchester United . I just ... . I just wish I could have seen him grow up . You know ? The important thing is he will grow up . Amen . CAMPBELL : Maybe you should have somebody help you . Sir , I am president of the Electronics Club the Math Club and the Chess Club . Now , if there 's a bigger nerd in here , please , point him out . I 'll just leave you alone to work on it , okay ? LUTHER : Come on , Buddha , come on . Do your business . Look , there 's nobody around . You know what ? I 'll turn around . I won 't look. I promise . [ DOG barking ] What ? Hey , man , there 's people out there . I was walking my dog . There 's hundreds of them . They 're walking on the snow . MAN : Where they all going ? They 're getting out of the city before it 's too late . CAMPBELL : All right , everybody . Quiet down . When was the last time anyone got a signal on a cell phone ? I got through to my cousin in Memphis an hour ago . They 're being evacuated to the South . CAMPBELL : We should get moving . The water is frozen over enough to walk on . We should go before the snow gets too deep . [ chattering ] CAMPBELL : Everyone , wrap yourselves up as fast as you can . We shouldn 't go . Why not , Sam ? Everyone 's leaving . When I talked to my dad , he told me to stay inside . The storm will kill anybody in it . - Then you have to say something . - l know . Excuse me , sir , you 're making a mistake . What ? Listen , we 're all scared , but we 've got no choice . - That 's not it . - Get ready to go . If these people go outside , they will freeze to death ! Okay , what is this nonsense ? It 's not nonsense . All right ? Look , this storm is gonna get worse . The people caught outside will freeze to death . - Where are you getting this ? - My dad 's a climatologist . - He works for the government . - So , what do we do ? We stay inside , we keep warm , and we wait it out . The snow is getting deeper by the minute . We 'd be trapped here without food , supplies ... . - lt 's a risk , yeah- - CAMPBELL : An unnecessary risk . SAM : No , no . It 's not . CAMPBELL : We 've wasted enough time talking . Let 's go . - Look , look . Just look for a second . CAMPBELL : Come on , everybody- - This storm is gonna get bad . It 's gonna get really , really bad . You 're not gonna be able to survive it . Believe me . Sir , please just stay . Just stay . Just don 't ... . MARIA : She 's set to go . Come on , straight to the back , guys . JACK [ OVER PHONE ] : It 'il be impossible to reach each other . Leave a message for me at the embassy in Mexico City . Okay , I will . I love you . I love you , Jack . Tell Sam I love him so much . God be with you . - Dr . Hall ? - Yeah . We haven 't been able to reach Peter 's parents . - l 'm gonna try later , okay ? - Okay . Thank you . I got it . You 're supposed to be on a bus heading south . I 've been watching your back for 20 years . You think I 'd let you go alone ? And all these years I thought I was watching your back . Where are the keys ? In the truck . Where do you think you 're going ? Neither one of you can navigate worth a damn . Without me , you 'll end up in Cleveland . I 'll try to give you updates on the storm as it heads your way . Good luck , Jack . REPORTER 1 : Breaking news from the U.S.-Mexico border . Just half an hour ago , Mexican officials closed the border in the light of so many U.S. refugees who are fleeing south in the wake of the approaching storm . These people came in anticipation of crossing into Mexico . Instead , they 've been met with closed gates . REPORTER 2 : And now , in a dramatic reversal of illegal immigration thousands of people are crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico . The scene unfolding here behind me is one of desperation and frustration . People have abandoned their cars , grabbed their belongings and they are wading across the river illegally into Mexico . judith : Here it is . This fireplace probably hasn 't been used in about 1 00 years . All right . - What are you doing ? - What did you think we would burn ? - You can 't burn books . - No , absolutely not . You want to freeze to death ? I 'll go get some more . I 'll help you . I 'm going with them . Okay , do you have a cafeteria or a lunchroom ? Just an employees ' lounge with a few vending machines . [ DOG barking ] We 're not gonna last long on MM 's and potato chips . What about the garbage cans ? There 's always something to eat in the garbage . Friedrich Nietzsche ? We can 't burn Nietzsche . He was the most important thinker of the 1 9th century . Please . He was a chauvinist pig in love with his sister . He was not a chauvinist pig . But he was in love with his sister . brian : Excuse me ? You guys ? Yeah , there 's a whole section on tax law down here that we can burn . REPORTER [ ON TV ] : After hours of uncertainty , traffic is moving smoothly from the United States into Mexico .

[ STATIC CRACKLING ] Did you get a signal ? brian : Yeah , for a minute . And ? brian : Man , this storm is everywhere . It 's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere . Europe is buried under 1 5 feet of snow and they say it 's gonna get just as bad here . I mean , I don 't think your dad 's gonna make it . No , he 'll make it . He 'll make it .

It was in the rare-books room . You think God 's gonna save you ? No . I don 't believe in God . You 're holding on to that Bible pretty tight . I 'm protecting it . This Bible is the first book ever printed . It represents the dawn of the age of reason . As far as I 'm concerned , the written word is mankind 's greatest achievement . You can laugh . But if Western civilization is finished I 'm gonna save at least one little piece of it . We heard somebody was left behind . - We brought an ambulance . - Thank God . Thank you so much for coming . [ GASPS ] [ coughing ] SAM : Hey . Hey , are you all right ? You look like you have a fever or something . I 'm fine . I just can 't sleep . My mind keeps going over all those worthless decathlon facts . - lt 's pretty stupid , huh ? - No , it 's all right . I guess you just haven 't had time to adjust yet . How am I supposed to adjust , Sam ? Everything I 've ever cared about , everything I 've worked for has all been preparation for a future that no longer exists . I know you always thought I took the competition too seriously . You were right . - lt was all for nothing . - No , no . I- - No , I just- - l just said that to avoid admitting the truth .

LUTHER : But how can it be hypothermia ? - We 've all been in- - - Maybe it 's the flu . judith : No , no , it 's not the flu . And how do you know ? Books can be good for things other than burning .

Like a cut that might have gotten infected ? She was complaining about a cut on her leg a few days ago . I didn 't think anything of it . brian : Oh , my gosh . That 's blood poisoning . Septicemia . She could go into septic shock . I 've seen that before . That can get bad . She needs a massive dose of penicillin or a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately , or ... . Or what ? PARKER : I 've never seen anything like it . There 's no point of reference . All I can see is cloud cover . What are you doing ? Taking infrared image of thermal currents . Send to Houston , Korolev , your weather service . PARKER : I 'll help you . Tom ? Tom , wake up . I just received some satellite images from the space station . You better take a look .

Well , we had to get inside in kind of a hurry , so I sort of pushed you in . I should be used to you pushing me around . Good to have you back . What are you doing ? The eye of the storm has passed , and we 're 40 miles from Manhattan . Shouldn 't we wait one more day ? Sam may not have one more day . What do you think 's gonna happen to us ? What do you mean ? I mean us . Civilization . Everybody . Mankind survived the last ice Age . We 're certainly capable of surviving this one . All depends on whether or not we 're able to learn from our mistakes . I sure as hell would like a chance to learn from mine . You did everything you could . I was thinking about Sam . Jack , you know the chances of Sam ... . I made my son a promise . I 'm going to keep it . FLIGHT DIRECTOR [ OVER radio ] : Parker , this is Houston . Do you read ? PARKER : Roger , mission control . Go ahead .

That 's good news . BECKER : these past few weeks have left us ail with a profound sense of humility in the face of nature 's destructive power . For years , we operated under the belief that we could continue consuming our planet 's natural resources without consequence . We were wrong . I was wrong . The fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil is a testament to our changed reality . Not only Americans but people all around the globe are now guests in the nations we once called The Third World . In our time of need , they have taken us in and sheltered us . And i am deeply grateful for their hospitality . BECKER [ ON TV ] : We mourn the loss of a leader whose order to evacuate ... . Peter ? Hey , you feeling okay today ? BECKER [ ON TV ] : For days , we 've despaired about the fate of the people who are trapped in the North . Today , there is cause for hope . Oniy a few hours ago , i received word that a small group of people survived in New York City against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity . I 've ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission to bring them home and to look for more survivors . GOMEZ : Jack ! It 's good to see you . Come on , let 's go get onboard . yuri : Look at that .

 Hey ! Jane Doe . Found last night entombed in a tenement wall ... by an agent who was following an anonymous tip . Time of death , approximately 2100 hours ... from three stab wounds to the abdomen . Dirt and clay were found ... under the nails of her right hand . What are those lacerations on her arms and feet ? Predation ... from rats . The agent was led to her body by the sound of their feeding . Anyone ? She was killed someplace else . She clawed at the dirt ... before succumbing to her injuries . That 's possible . What else would help us I.D. This victim ... find the killer ? It 's obvious , isn 't it ? What is ? The chipped nail polish . The drugstore hair rinse . This is a single woman , unemployed . That 's why no one 's I.D. ' d her . You found blood alcohol ? Point zero four . She hooked up with the wrong man in a bar . He killed her . This man has killed before . And you know that because ... That bruise beneath her ribs ? It 's from the hilt of a knife . The killer intended a single blow ... the blade thrusting upward at a 45-degree angle ... into the heart , causing death instantly . But she struggled , so he missed . Then he got mad . Like I said ... obvious . Agent Scully ? Great : Thank you . You got something ? Quite a lot , actually . We 've identified yourJane Doe , as Ellen Persich , 28 ... from Redland , Maryland . How 'd you make the I.D. So fast ? The bar that she was at last night ... is about a half a mile ... from where another woman , Rita Shaw ... was murdered two weeks ago ... apparently by the same killer . You 're saying the bodyJohn found was the second victim ? This says that Rita Shaw was found in a ditch ... dead from a single knife wound . The woman I found was plastered behind a wall ... and stabbed three times . That 's why I didn 't make the connection at first , either ... but that was the lab on the phone ... and they confirmed that it was the same knife in both killings . Well , how did you make the connection ? I didn 't ... but one of my students realized that the killer ... only meant to stab Agent Doggett 's victim once . The other wounds were out of anger ... because he missed . That 's a pretty astute observation . Amazingly so . This cadet have any other answers up his sleeve ? Like what ? I want to know why someone tipped me off to this in the first place ... 'cause this isn 't an X-file ... not by a long shot . I don 't know , Agent Doggett , but now that you 've got this case ... I 'd say run with it . Ted Hayes ? Rudolph Hayes ? I 'm Agent Doggett . This is Agent Reyes . Is that part of the training here , Cadet , smelling body parts ? This man 's flesh smells of creosote ... but his skin is soft . Untanned . He worked indoors . A hardware store , probably . The tear marks at his elbow go from left to right . He was broadsided in a car accident . His hands gripped the wheel so hard ... his thumb bone snapped on impact . You determined all that just by looking at that arm ? I see things . We came to thank you . Because of your analysis ... we were able to work up a profile ... to catch the man who murdered those women . What 's the profile ? White male , 25 to 35 , ex-military . Employed near the bars where he met ... Why are you shaking your head ? The profile 's wrong . Your killer is in his 40s . A felon , recently arrived from out of state . His parole officer thinks he 's looking for a job . He already has one ... working for organized crime . He 's killed many people . He 's going to keep on killing . Kind of annoying , isn 't he ? John . Nicholas Regali ? I 'm Agent Reyes . This is Agent Doggett . Oh , don 't put them away so fast , Agents . I want to read them . John Jay ... Dog ... it . Monica Reyes . Mr. Regali , you 're in town in violation of the terms of your parole ... back in New York . Call my parole officer . She 'll tell you I 'm here looking for work . You come here often , Mr. Regali ? Like last night ... when Ellen Persich got murdered in the parking lot out back ? Last night . I don 't remember . Maybe you remember being at the Bent Oak . Bartender says he saw you there two weeks ago . The same night a woman named Rita Shaw got stabbed in the heart . What do you have to say about that , Mr. Regali ? You folks don 't know what you 're dealing with . You don 't want to play this game , flatfoot . Not with me . You like to kill women , Mr. Regali ? You may think you can get away with it ... but that 's not going to happen . Like I said ... you really don 't know what you 're dealing with . I think we do . Agent Dog ... it . Agent Reyes . How long you been standing there ? Not long . I 'm glad you dropped by . Wanted to tell you ... we hit pay dirt with your profile . No arrests yet , but we 're building our case . There 's something else . There 's another case I 'd like you to take a look at . Seven-year-old boy rides his bike around the block . His mom 's on the porch , counting his laps . He waves to her every time he goes by ... and after six laps , he doesn 't come back around . She goes looking for him . She finds his bike lying on the sidewalk . There 's no witnesses ... no ransom demands ... no clue as to who took him or why . The cops search door-to-door ... block-to-block for two days . Nothing . No news at all . And after three days ... they find him in a field . It 's all in here . The particulars ... about my son . I 've been over this I don 't know how many times ... but after nine years , there 's not a lot to go on . You were such a big help yesterday . If there 's anything you see here ... Agent Doggett ... that case I helped you with yesterday ? That is your son 's . What is this ? Unsolved murders . I started collecting them before I came to the FBI . I couldn 't tell you why . What do you do with these ? If I sit with them ... for a long time ... very quietly ... they tell me things . It 's how I see what I see . You 've been following my son 's case . For a long time . He calls to me . Cadet ... you should know there 's a real good chance you 're nuts . You recognize that man ? It 's Bob Harvey . It 's the closest we ever had to a suspect . He died . Killed in a car crash last year in New Orleans . This man killed my son ? He took him . He didn 't kill him . Are you saying the same man that killed those women ... killed my son ? This guy Regali ? Assistant Director ? Can I have a minute ? It 's not a good time . I 'm off to a meeting with the Director . This can 't wait . And the Director can ? Okay , you 've got one minute . When you were in New York ... you worked the organized crime task force , right ? Mm-hmm . Did you ever hear of a guy named Nicholas Regali ? Yeah , he was ... a collector ... a low-level thug . Why are you asking , Agent Doggett ? When the New York office was investigating my son 's death ... his name never came up . Well , why would it ? You have reason to believe he was involved ? I 've got no evidence ... but somebody 's telling me he 's mixed-up with the suspect ... in my son 's kidnapping , this Bob Harvey . Well , I never heard that . And I 'm sure I 'd remember . You want me to ask around and pull some files ? I 'll see what I can find . I 'd appreciate it . John ! Where you been ? Chasing down leads . We were supposed to meet ... in the office this morning , remember ? To go over what we have on Regali . I think this guy , Regali ... may have been involved in Luke 's death . What ? Since when ? Since I 've been talking to Cadet Hayes . He says Regali knew Bob Harvey ... that they were in on it together . How could he possibly know that ? How does he know half the stuff he knows ? I did some digging . I found out that Bob Harvey and Regali ... both did time at Walkill in 1988 . So did a thousand other men . That doesn 't mean they knew each other . I tracked Regali 's credit card use , Monica . The day Luke disappeared ... he gassed his car up two miles from my house . Regali is a New Yorker . A lot of New Yorkers visit Long Island . This is not evidence ... not even close . I will never know how badly it hurt you to lose your son ... or how much pain you still carry . I understand how much you want to find his killer ... but I don 't want to see you disappointed . Not again . It 's not going to happen . Not this time . Hi , Barbara . How you doing ? When 'd you get the new furniture ? Last year . I just wanted to make a change . It looks great . You look great . You need to call first , John . It kind of throws me when you just show up here . I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . I need to talk to you , Barb . It 's about Luke . I got a suspect . Oh , God . John ... I know , I know . But this time , it 's different . Is it ? He could be , he might be . I want to find out who did this just as badly as you do . But I don 't want you coming over here again ... bringing all this up ... unless you know ... unless you absolutely know . That 's what I thought . Look , this guy may have been cruising the neighborhood . You could have seen him . Did you hear anything I said ? Agent Scully ? I 'm Barbara . John 's ex-wife . Hi . I 'm Dana . Nice to meet you . He said you 'd be coming by . You weren 't able to make an identification ? I didn 't expect to . You know he doesn 't think clearly about this . He can 't . He blames himself . He thinks he failed Luke . In his mind , he can never do enough ... never suffer enough for what happened . I think if you could help him ... find the man who did this ... maybe he could move on . He and Monica could have something together . He just won 't let her in . They 're letting him go ? For now . I 'll be at my mom 's till tomorrow . Tell me you got something . As you asked , I compared the wounds inflicted on your son ... with the wounds on these two women . And ? There are similarities ... between the trajectory of the wounds ... and the force with which they were delivered . Meaning Regali 's the guy . Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic deduction ... on Cadet Hayes 's part . But that 's all it is . The killer used different weapons ... he demonstrated no consistent M.O. And no clear victimology . None of it will hold up in court . Well , something out there will . Something 's not right . What do you mean ? Here 's a guy whose name comes up in connection ... with racketeering , prostitution , drugs , even murder ... yet all he 's got are nickel and dime convictions . Always gets off with just a slap on the wrist . You know as well as I do mob cases are hard to build . What I 'm saying is ... I don 't think anyone 's even trying . I think this guy Regali 's greasing somebody . As in bribery ? What else could it be ? What ? What is it ? Agents . I was just coming to see you . We need to talk to you , Assistant Director . About New York . Oh , didn 't you get the case files ? I mean when we were working in the New York office . You and me . I 'm not following . I used to get takeout from a place on 11 th Street . A little hole-in-the-wall . Maybe you remember it . Carlo 's . Is it me , or , uh ... is this becoming an odd conversation ? One night , three years ago , I 'm waiting for my order . I wandered toward the kitchen . And I saw you . Me ? Talking to a man . A mob guy . I saw you take money from him , Brad . A stack of it . Three years ago ? So , instead of asking me to explain it ... or even reporting me to the Bureau ... you broke off our relationship and moved away ? I cared about you , Brad . I 'm not defending my actions . And now you 've come here because you think I 'm on the take . Maybe I was on the take ... when Agent Doggett 's son was murdered . Somebody gave Regali inside help . Covered his role in my son 's death . The man you saw me with was a confidential informant . I was giving him the money . That 's not what happened . We were buying his help to infiltrate a crime family . It 's all documented . The entire operation . Now I can prove what I 'm saying . Can you ? You should have come to me , Monica . Especially given what I know now . What do you know ? When you raised concerns about Regali ... I looked into the source of these allegations ... uh , a cadet , right ? Rudolph Hayes . He 's been very helpful in this investigation . Rudolph Hayes died in 1978 in a car accident . What ? Let me see that . Cadet Hayes 's real name is Stuart Mimms ... of Mendota , Minnesota . Last known residence ... the Dakota County Psychiatric Facility . He was a mental patient ? Diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic ... voluntarily institutionalized in 1990 . In 1992 , he checked himself out and disappeared . There 's another thing . We can also place him in New York City in 1993 ... the year your son was murdered . Nice car . I remember when they had you banging around ... in a ten-year-old Impala . Now look at you . Mr. Assistant Director . You got lucky . He has another suspect . You came down here to tell me that ? There 's something I need to know . Were you in any way involved ... in the death of John Doggett 's son ? Since when do you ask me questions ? Were you involved ? Course not . What kind of guy do you think I am ? That 's it , I 'm done , Regali . Done ? With you , with this , with this whole thing . And if I say no , what are you going to do ? You know , if I 'm you , right now I 'm thinking ... " I could bop this guy right here ... and who 's going to know it 's not self defense ? " Well , let me remind you ... anything happens to me ... a videotape lands at the Washington Post ... showing a young Brad Follmer taking cash from yours truly ... to make an indictment go away . You 're done when I say you 're done . It 's all in there . How you defrauded the FBI with a false identity ... in order to gain admittance to the Academy . We know who you really are . We know about your history with schizophrenia . We know that you orchestrated this entire thing ... in order to get close to Agent Doggett . I 've been recognized ... by Agent Doggett 's ex-wife ... who failed to identify ... Nicholas Regali in that same room yesterday . Because Nicholas Regali did not kill Agent Doggett 's son . You did . That 's one explanation . It 's the explanation . No . Then what is ? What is ? ! I told you before , Agent Doggett . I studied the photos of your son 's death . They called to me . I don 't know why ... but it was a message , and I listened . And then you killed Agent Doggett 's son ? I studied his case obsessively . I 'm a schizophrenic . That 's what schizophrenics do . Obsess . I watched Agent Doggett . I watched his ex-wife , too . She can 't tell you how she recognizes me ... just that she does . You 're a liar . You lied to the FBI . You 're lying now . Would you have listened to me otherwise ? A mental patient with insight into your son 's death ? I wanted to get close to you , Agent Doggett . To help you . You gave me that tip . To find the woman 's body in the wall . Regali associated with the man who abducted your son . I called you ... so that you could catch him . I 've received another message . I 'd like to go back home now to the institution . John ? John ? Well ? Well , he told us his story . Whether it 's true ... In other words , we 're nowhere . Again . Well , well . It 's the FBI agent . I 'm not here as an FBI agent . I 'm here as a father . Whoa . What could that mean ? I want to know what happened to my son . I don 't know who killed your son . But I like you , FBI . I really do . I 'll tell you how it could have happened , hypothetically . Say there was this guy , businessman . And say this businessman ... in the course of doing business ... has to associate with any number ... of thugs , sickos , perverts . Like Bob Harvey , for example . And say this Bob Harvey likes little boys . Yeah . Disgusting . Say one day , Bob Harvey sees a little boy ... riding a bike , and he can 't stand it . He grabs the boy . So , Harvey takes the boy back to his place ... only he doesn 't tell ... the businessman what he 's doing . So , the businessman walks in on him . You see what I 'm saying , FBI ? The boy sees the businessman 's face . The businessman who never did nothing to this little boy . That 's a problem . Well ... every problem has got a solution , right ? Oh , my God . He shot him . He just took out his gun and shot him .

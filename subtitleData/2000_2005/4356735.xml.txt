Please send the man round back and pick up Clyde Smith a professional gambler who ' s about to have an unfortunate accident . A casino where I 'm winning ? That car must have killed me . I must be in heaven . A casino where I always win ? That 's boring . I must really be ... in hell ! No . You 're not in heaven or hell . You 're on an airplane . A gremlin 's destroying the plane ! You 've gotta believe me ! - Why should I ? You 're Hitler . - No ! Eva Braun , help me ! - Saw it coming . - I just saw something incredibly cool . A big floating ball that lit up with every color in the rainbow plus some new ones that were so beautiful I cried . - In front of Discount Shoe Outlet ? - Yeah . They have a kid wear that to attract customers . I don 't care if it was a dork in a costume . For a moment , I felt the heartbeat of creation , and it was one with my own . - Big deal . - We all feel like that all the time . - You don 't hear us gassing on about it . - How can you be so bias ? It 's the year 3000 , yet you sit around like it 's the boring time I came from . Boring ? Wasn 't that the period when they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the earth ? Yeah . But now it 's the distant future . Why aren 't we doing everything I ever dreamed of ? - You know what might be a hoot ? - No . Why would I know that ? Let 's take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do . - Everything ? - Except that . So your fantasy has always been to destroys a planet ? Yeah . What did they ever do for me ? The most humdrum activities seem almost exciting through your eyes . - What next ? - I wanna see the edge of the universe . - Sounds cool . - Funny , you live in the universe but you never do these things till someone visits . FARNSWORTH : There it is ! The edge of the universe . Far out . So there 's an infinite number of parallel universes ? - No , just the two . - Well , I 'm sure that 's enough . I 'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me . Let 's move on to Fry 's next fantasy . Yee-ha ! Bow before your master , puny mortals . [ FRY CHEERS ] - Mommy , why is that man like that ? - Don 't look at him . That was fun . Let 's give him a treat . Keep your palms flat . [ DINOSAUR CHEWS ] [ GIGGLES ] The tongue tickles . These new hands are great . I 'll break them in tonight . It 's been quite an hour and a half . Two fantasies left : To be invisible in a chocolate factory and to be romantically linked with a celebrity . I could pound your head till you think that 's what happened . Wait , hold on . It is possible to meet any celebrity . - It is ? - Of course . You should read a blimp . " Download a celebrity . " What part of that do I understand ? It 's simple . You can download a celebrity into a blank robot . I have an idea . Let 's do that . Onto the Internet you go . While you 're there , pick me up a few credit card numbers . Kirk could kick Picard 's ass . At least Picard had the guts to admit he was bald . You take that back . EBay . Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy ? Sold to the being of inconceivable horror . - Will a money order be okay ? - Yes . [ LAUGHS MANIACALLY ] - Where 's the celebrity dating place ? - Let 's search the Web . Over there . Welcome to Nappster . Let 's see who we 've got in stock . - Gwyneth Paltrow ? - Nah . I read she drinks human blood . How about Cleopatra , whose beauty destroyed mighty empires ? I 'd prefer someone with shaved underarms . Do you have anything with a Lucy Liu feel to it ? Nothing like that . Although we do have Lucy Liu . Only woman to be named People 's Sexiest Woman of the Year twice : In 2003 and then again in 2063 . I 'd like the 2003 model . I found her ! What do I do now ? Download her . Let 's just put a blank robot in the drive . It worked . You 're one sexy man , Philip J. Fry . FRY : It worked perfectly . Well , you downloaded Lucy Liu . Are you just gonna stare vacantly at her ? I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive , Philip J. Fry . Hear that ? She likes me . Well , duh ! She 's programmed to like you . But this is Lucy Liu , the only good actress of the 21 st century . She 's more than software . Would you like to register me ? - Not right now . - I 'll remind you later , you hot stud . So , what do you feel like doing ? - Would you like to register me ? - I said later . When I feel so stuffed I can 't eat I use the restroom , and then I can eat more . You should write a book . People need to know about the " can eat more . " You 're just like I thought you 'd be from your movies . My personality is mathematically derived from my movies proportionately weighted by box office receipts . - You 're cute . - You 're cute . - You . - You . Oh , dear . She 's stuck in an infinite loop and he 's an idiot . That 's love for you . Humans dating robots is sick . You people wonder why I 'm still single ? It 's ' cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans ! This is Fry 's decision . And he made it wrong , so it 's time for us to interfere . She doesn 't love you . She can 't . She 's a machine ... Stay away from our women ! You 've got metal fever , boy ! So what if I love a robot ? It 's not hurting anybody . He never took middle school hygiene . He never saw the propaganda film . It 's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times . Ordinary human dating . It 's enjoyable , and it serves an important purpose . But when a human dates an artificial mate , there is no purpose only enjoyment . And that leads to tragedy . Neat-o ! A Marilyn Monroe-Bot . You 're a dreamboat , Billy Everyteen . Harmless fun ? Let 's see what happens next . Do you want to walk your dog ? I 'd rather make out with my Monroe-Bot . Do you want to get a paper route and earn some cash ? No , thanks . I 'd rather make out with my Monroe-Bot . Do you want to come over ? We can make out together . Your house is across the street . That 's an awfully long way to go for making out . What went wrong in that scene ? Ordinarily , Billy would work hard to make money with his paper route then use the money to buy dinner for Mavis thus earning a slim chance to perform the reproductive act . But if teens can date robots , why should he bother ? Why should anyone bother ? Let 's look at Billy 's planet a year later . Where are all the football stars ? And where are the biochemists ? They 're trapped . Trapped in the soft , viselike grip of robot lips . All civilization was an effort to impress the opposite sex . And sometimes the same sex . Now , let 's skip forward 80 years into the future . Where 's Billy ? Farewell . NARRATOR : The next day , Billy 's planet was destroyed by aliens . Have you guessed the name of Billy 's planet ? It was Earth ! Don 't date robots ! Brought to you by The Space Pope . Did that make any impression on you ? Fry ? I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonorrhea : The Noisy Killer . BENDER : What is the world coming to ? That Fry 's a sicko pervert , I tell you . Dating a robot , it 's an atrosamacy ! - But Fry 's our friend , Bender . - Will you stifle there , meat bag ? - You stifle , Bender . - Finally you 're standing up to him . Although he is completely right . We 've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay . It 's time to shut down Nappster . Com . Who 's in charge ? If you 're an investor , you can dump your money in the hole . - Listen , you Internet nerd . - Listening . Your company promotes wrong love . If you don 't shut down , the only thing wired about you will be your jaw . The Internet is about the free exchange and sale of other people 's ideas . - We 've done nothing wrong . WOMAN : Help ! I 'm being held prisoner . Someone in trouble is . No . Stay out . There 's a guy going for the Tetris world record in there . - Who are you ? - Don 't hurt us . Help me ! They 've been holding me prisoner for 800 years . The real Lucy Liu ! The one you can see a movie of . What 's your problem ? Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us . It hurts ! [ KNOCKING ] JEFF : Open this door . Don 't make me call the maintenance guy . - It 's a bluff . - We can 't take that chance . Move ! - Please pick me up before you go-go . - She asked first . Are you Lucy Liu ? Sure . We 're doomed ! They got the head . They uncovered the sign . The world will learn we 're cyber-criminals . We 'd have gotten away with it if it weren 't for those meddling adults . We 'll stop them . They like Lucy Liu ? We 'll give them all the Lucy Liu they can handle . Hand me that backup disk . Did you see me escaping ? I was all like : Thanks for rescuing me . Especially you , Bender . Quite a masculine piece of metal , aren 't you ? Don 't look at me like that . If you 're thinking of crossing the line , you can forget it . Bender don 't bend that way . Hey , look . It 's another Lucy Liu-Bot . I am Lucy Liu . Give me your spines . Hey , what the ... ? Take this , and that , and one of these . Cut it out . I don 't need this kind of publicity . All right , Liu . Time to kick your frosty , well-toned ass . Then along came Bender . Looks like you 're retaining water . That was incredible , Bender . You 're like Jackie Chan before he got doughy . Shucks , I wasn 't afraid of that robot . I 'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior ... - It 's an army of Lucy Lius ! - They 're horrible . Take this , and that , and one of these . - Robot Crouching Tiger . - Robot Crane Style . Now that 's a wave of destruction that 's easy on the eyes . This is the best movie I 've ever seen . It has a vampire and an explosion . It 's amazing the way you notice two things . No ! Don ' t open that coffiin . It 's ticking . I have to , Alex . That coffiin ' s not going to open itself . Let 's hide in here . It 'll add to my box office gross . - Fry ? - You guys came to watch me make out . That is so sweet . Wait , is that the head of who I think it 's of ? Read the jar , Evelyn Wood . Doctor Z ? A herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city . Is yours acting normally ? Let me see . Yep . Why do you ask ? If you want to see the real vampire , look in the mirror . I can ' t . I 'm a vampire . Why ? And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody . Quick , this way . Sorry , ladies . Employees only . They 're forming a human pyramid ... Of robots . We weren 't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy . A dangerous mistake to make . - At least we 've got food . - Dr. Zoidberg , cut open that bag . - Hooray ! - And don 't eat it . LIU-BOTS : Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! LIU-BOT 1 : Data error . LIU-BOT 2 : Do not compute . Life was bad , but now it 's good forever ! You 'll be safe in here , sweetheart . Get lost , Pavarotti . [ GLASS BREAKS ] If I don 't survive the corn I love you as much as a man can love a computerized image which is a lot . Oh , Fry . I love you more than the moon and the stars and the ... Poetic image number 37 not found . What are you doing ? Get down . Light hot . Oil temperature rising . - Oh , no . - Malfunction . - This ain 't good . - System error . You saved us . Are you all right ? Yes , my love . I 'll be just ... Massive corn clog in port seven . - Are you the last copy of me ? - Yes . - Erase her , Fry . - What ? No ! When you downloaded her without my permission , you stole my image and that 's all I have . That and the largest gold nugget in the world . I downloaded her because I love you . If you love the real me , not just what you 've seen in movies genre-straddling lawyer shows and articles in People magazine you 'll blank out that robot . I 'm sorry . Hug me , Liu-Bot . I 'll always remember you , Fry . Memory deleted . I know it hurts , buddy . But at least you 're not in a sick relationship anymore . And I guess now I can get to know the real Lucy Liu . - Yeah , at our wedding . - It 's true . Bender and I are in love . But ... But ... Don 't be a prude , Fry .

 Lieutenant Velorek ... this display of force will change nothing ! This is not a display . I offer you one final chance to cooperate . I have been bonded to this leviathan for twenty - one cycles . Two minds , two bodies ... intertwined as one . Whatever your secret project is ... I will not participate . This leviathan will do what I wish , if you lead her to do so . You Peacekeepers ... subjugate us ... torture us . And now you expect us to cooperate with you ? You have no understanding of the covenant between leviathan and pilot ! `Et art eta ' . Another ... pilot ? He 's being held down in the transport bay , awaiting your decision . I insist you reverse the control collar anesthetic , and reawaken this leviathan at once ! You " insist " ? Lieutenant , what is taking so long ? I 'm offering her one last chance to see the folly of her ... You have secured a replacement pilot . Yes Captain but ... FIRE ! How long will it take to replace it ? I can 't be certain until we extract the body . Then stop wasting my time . Get your unit working ! MOVE ! How far down there do you think it is ? I don 't know . We 'll find out soon enough . I hate waste removal . Keep your opinions to yourselves ! Is that clear ! ? Yes , Sir ! Where did you find this ? Top tier . Digging through all the dren stored up there . Must be some kind of Peacekeeper recording device . Did you see what I see ? This is Aeryn ... - It - it shows she 's been aboard Moya ... - Peacekeepers must have kept these things running twenty - four / seven , to spy on their own people . Crichton , that is Aeryn . She 's been aboard Moya before . She killed a pilot . Yes , it 's me . I admit it . Are you happy now ? This shows you have been aboard Moya before . Why didn 't you ever tell us ? Criminally obvious , isn 't it ? She helped murder a defenseless pilot ! It must have been about three cycles ago . I 've been aboard hundreds of leviathans , and I had no idea that it was Moya . - Oh , so all non - sebaceans look alike . Is that it ? - I didn 't know , Chiana . Look- - the Aeryn on that tape , is not the Aeryn we know . That was a long time ago . Three cycles isn 't that long . Heh ! I was aboard Moya by then . As was I. Maybe you were one of the ones who took a turn at torturing me ! Ever torture a Hynerian ? - Perhaps you helped torture me , too . - No ! Aeryn ... just don 't ... Okay , everybody . Neutral corners . Let 's chill out for a microt ... we all have things in our past that we 'd rather not have on instant replay . True enough , John . But I still can 't accept the cold - blooded slaughter of such a helpless creature . Oh ! It 's perfectly fine to cut off one of his arms then , is it Zhaan ! ? - Peacekeeper murderer ! - Aeryn ! No ! Don 't ... you 're not helping your case . What have you guys been thinking all this time ? What ? She was out picking Rauliss Buds while all the other mean Peacekeepers did all the really nasty stuff ? She was a Peacekeeper . Yes . I was a Peacekeeper . And things were very different then . My priorities ... my values ... and my relationships ... - Artillery is taking off . - Yes , sir . Officer Sun . Wish you were back flying prowlers again , eh ? You 're a very fine pilot . I 'm glad you were reassigned to fly my transport . We were in space for ... twenty - two solar days ... ? And not once did you ask what the cargo was . I get yanked from Prowler duty without cause , and reassigned to transport duty . That 's fine ... I do what I 'm ordered to do , but it doesn 't mean I have to be interested . Healthy curiosity isn 't against regulations , officer . Asking questions is , and besides , if I had a question to ask my superiors , it would be why was I pulled from Prowler detail , and when do I get to go back . The replacement Pilot . Aeryn . You saw Pilot ... our pilot ... being brought on board . I was sent on the cargo transport mission , and that was my cargo . If I 'd known that it was Moya ... that it was our Pilot ... I would have said something long ago . I can 't tell if you 're lying or not . One thing I do know ... for all our sakes ... Pilot had better never see this recording . What 's done is done . There 's nothing we can do about it now . If you 'll excuse me , I 'd rather spend the next few arns alone . So ... our Pilot wasn 't Moya 's first Pilot ... . Well , I su - sure didn 't know you could replace them . You can replace them all right , but it 's a long ... difficult , dangerous procedure . I - I think I 'll go check up on Zhaan . So , the guy on ... the tape ... that was his job ? Replace Miss Pilot with Mr. Pilot ? It was Velorek 's job to bond the new pilot to the ship . To Moya ... any way he could . Remember what we discussed ... remember what we discussed . There 's nothing to be afraid of . I can 't understand what he 's saying . He 's speaking in his species ancient language . Once sentence can carry over a hundred different facts ... concepts , emotions- - far too complex for our translator microbes . Once he 's calmed down , once he 's comfortable here , then he 'll start to simplify his sentences for us . You will straighten out , and you will do so immediately ... is that clear ! ? Captain Crais . Running into problems already , Lieutenant ? You 're not filling me with confidence . No ; not a problem , sir . No . It 's happened . It 's over . Like Zhaan said , what 's done is done . I can 't undo it . I just thought ... perhaps , if you talked ... " No " means no , John . I estimate that insertion will be complete in 83 arns . - You may have 60 . - It can 't be done . Then you will find a way . Your sole responsibility is to install this new Pilot and teach her to command this leviathan as I direct her . This Pilot is a ... he , sir . With all due respect ... I understand my responsibilities . But this Pilot is young and inexperienced . That is why the Peacekeeper Military Tech sent me you . You were the only one who could do what I want ... as quickly as I want . The success of my project depends on it . Are you telling me you can 't ? It will take time to acclimate him ... more time to conform physiology ... and even more time to teach it . And that is what my report will say . And my report will say that they 're merely excuses to mask your own incompetence . Whose report do you think will be believed ? Don 't you threaten me Lieutenant ! Take a lesson from your new Pilot ... anyone can be replaced . Captain Crais ? Officer Aeryn Sun , Icarion Company , Pleisar Regiment ... currently reassigned . I 'd like to state my case for being returned to my regular assignment as a Prowler ... I guess we 're stuck with each other for at least a little longer . Well , well , if it isn 't our high and mighty little prowler pilot Too good to get down in the hull with us and dig out that old Pilot 's guts ... eh ? All those nerve fibers ... I couldn 't believe how far down that beastie got into the ship ... Well you 're one of us now ... you 'll be digging guts with us next time ... You 're makin ' hamburger there . Talk to me ... come on . What happened back then ? ... huh ? Crichton ... you might have noticed that at times I 've ... kept you at a distance . Many times ... Vast ... Distances There 's a reason for that . Just one ? Go ahead . Most Peacekeepers are bred ... and reared , for one purpose ... military service . Procreation is ... assigned . There 's no such thing as a life long mate . But you have relationships ... the male - female kind ? Of course , as many and as often as you want . Peacekeeper High Command understands the troop 's biological needs . Only , you don 't connect with anyone openly ... and never with any longevity ... . I guess ... the point is ... my relationships , back then , tended to be somewhat ... Empty ? Painful . Wh - what does this have to do with the tape ? What ... ah ... this is about that guy ... Velorek . - What about him ? - He ... um ... He ... what ? ... we we were lovers . Lovers ... Lovers ... um ... interesting ... I - I don 't think I 've ever heard you use that word ... before . So. uh ... .D ... you ... Did you love him ? I felt something for him that I never felt with any of the other men I ... recreated with . I didn 't know what it was , but I guess now I 'd say that it was love . Right ... Well , from the way you tell the story , he sounded kind of sadistic . No , just the opposite , that was the problem ... Officer Sun ! We must talk . How the hell did he get a hold of that ? It doesn 't matter , he 's seen it , and I have to go talk to him . - Fine , I 'll go with you . - No , it has to be just him and me . Pilot ... - this is difficult for both of us . - Both of us ! ? It isn 't me on that recording committing barbaric slaughter - ... with no remorse ! - This is me , Pilot ... Aeryn ! We are closer than any two others on this ship . I still carry remnants of your DNA inside of me . That is why your betrayal cuts so deep . Your DNA is the same DNA as the pilot ... on this recording . Do you have any idea how I felt when I saw it ? When I was reminded of what I had done ! ? - Prepare for all power units to connect ! - We 're ready sir . Ok , were ready to remove this thing now . So remember ... calm and easy , okay ? Okay , here we go . Slow , slow , slow . Remember , simple sentences . Yes ? Am I there ? Indeed you are . Your new home . The ship ... - Her name is Moya . - " Moya " No ! Crichton ... .Crichton ! Aeryn ! What happened ? Aeryn went to see Pilot , he somehow got his hands on the recording . I had that recording in my quarters ... hidden ! Does she ... know I 'm here ? Does she ... She 's under heavy sedation at the moment , she will be until the bonding is complete . But the bonding takes over a cycle . Sometimes two . That is natural bonding ; we don 't have time for that . NO ! Pilot ! He 's venting the chamber ! This ship ... this " Moya " . She doesn 't know her old pilot is dead , does she ? When she is awakened , my presence here will be a complete surprise to her . By then , the bonding process will be complete . There is no time to allow you further adjustments to your new surroundings . It 's best for all of us , the sooner we get this over with ... You killed this ships first pilot ... the pilot who belonged here ! I will not have you aboard defiling her with your presence ! Until Aeryn leaves this vessel ... Moya will not move another metra ! You stole the datacam from D 'Argo 's room , didn 't ya ? You showed it to Pilot , didn 't ya ? - He deserved to see the truth ! - Ah , the truth ! - It was my ethical duty ! - Ethical ? - I am a Dominar of principle , as well as action ! - Principle ! ? No , no , no . I think you showed it to him so he owed you one ! Yeah ! A big one ! Well ? Pilot is a creature of his word ... we have not moved one metra ... we 're just drifting . You know , we 've never seen Pilot like this before . Chop off an arm- - the best he can muster is a few snotty remarks . But this ... he shuts down the ship , and he tries to kill Aeryn . Shut down is right . We 're not moving unless he wants us to . There 's more to it than what 's on that recording . Kind of makes you wonder how bad things were back then . I wouldn 't know ... I spent the whole time with my collarbones chained to the walls of my cell . Ah- - I didn 't `hurt ' you , my dear ? You 're done Zhaan ... Thank you for your compassion . Interesting ... hearing `you' speak of compassion . You think I lack compassion ? That Pilot is right and that I defile Moya with my presence ? Well , you know what ? He 's right , and you are right ! And I will be in my prowler and out of here in less than an arn ! - I 'm sorry . - No , Zhaan ... I am what I am ... and I did what I did . Aeryn , you had no choice back them . You did exactly what was expected of you ... In that world , that was the only kind of Peacekeeper you could be . Did you hear some call to battle stations that I didn 't ? No . But we 're finished , and I have to get to my duty station . Well , you 're not expected there for another half arn . Spend it here . With me . You don 't ... enjoy being here with me ? Hmm . I enjoy it . But ... it just isn 't right ... to actually `feel ' something for a fellow Peacekeeper , is it ? Well , what 's the point ? We won 't be assigned to be together forever . We could be . I 'm fairly high in the Military Tech Hierarchy . I could make it happen ... if ... you wanted me to . Peacekeeper High Command makes all assignment decisions . High Command doesn 't always make the right decisions . Come on Aeryn . You and I have been intimate since the second solar day of our voyage to get here . There 's something about you ... something special ... and I think you know it . No . No . I 'm not special . Don 't take the Peacekeeper hard line , Aeryn . You understand what I 'm saying . Can you honestly tell me ... all you want is to fly prowlers , like a thousand others ? And serve a madman like Captain Crais ? That is outright insubordination ! No , it 's not . It 's observation . Think beyond the box the Peacekeepers put your mind into . Crais is a maniac , and his coveted `project ' ... is an abomination . No . I don 't know anything about Crais ' project , and I don 't want to know . The project will likely kill this leviathan . And I cannot let that happen . Will not . What does that mean ? Aeryn , I know how I feel about you . And I think I know how you feel about me . When I leave here ... I want you to come with me . You can be so much more . Aeryn . What are you doing ? She 's going to do as Pilot asks . She 's planning to leave Moya . Pilot , we have to talk . Let 's hash this out . Right here . Right now . Five cents , the Doctor is In . Major systems grafts are complete now . Are you ready for this ? I 'm- - I 'm in a great deal of pain . You 'll get used to the pain . Get used to it ? It- - will go away , won 't it ? I 'm afraid not , an unfortunate , but permanent side effect of the grafting process . Now , I 'm about to reawaken the leviathan . All of her sense will reawaken instantly , along with her consciousness . Remember , her senses are now yours . Nothing I can say will prepare you for what you are about to experience . Try not to be afraid . I won 't cry out . You will . Something is wrong ! Something is horribly wrong ! Moya can sense your presence . She knows that you 're not her old Pilot . What is that ! ? I 'm sorry ; it 's a pain pulse from her control collar . We must force her to accept you . It is unbreakable ! The only way to force her to accept you as her new pilot . Moya only accepted me because she was tortured into it . Tortured into it ! Moya is free of me . Pilot , what the hell have you ... I am no longer bonded to her . I 'm reading major variances in the life support system . The internal gravity bladders are all deforming , and Moya is trying to fix it herself . That 's because Pilot is off - line . Crichton ! What the frell is going on down there ? Pilot , what the hell have you done ? No , no , no . No , no , no , no , no . This is not good ! No , no . Not good ! The pain is ... finally gone . And Pilot 's been in pain all this time ? Very likely , I remember that Velorek was forced to graft Pilot to Moya 's systems , instead of letting the process occur naturally . And why didn 't you tell us about this before ? Because I didn 't know it was this Pilot , remember ? Kids ! Save it ... for `after school ' ! Right now , how do we fix this thing so we stop bobbing about like three men in a tub ? We don 't . We need Pilot 's help . He 's got to instruct us through the process manually . Yeah , well . I don 't think Pilot 's in a ... `leviathan for dummies kind of mood right now . - There , how 's that ? - Much better . The DRD 's are responding to my impulses now , hundreds of them . Velorek , I 've completed the task you asked for . Everything went according to plan . The structure 's in place ? The shaft is sealed ? Good . Good . Great . What secret project , Lieutenant Velorek ? I see your heightened senses are fully functional now . This project is nothing for you to concern yourself with . I 've just made certain that it should never be a threat to you , or the ship , ever again . I have to talk to him . Aeryn . No , no , no , no . Pilot 's Etch - A - Sketch isn 't operating with all it 's knobs right now . I 'm afraid seeing you won 't help . Besides , he 's locked himself inside his chamber , and the DRD 's have taken up defensive positions . He must have used voice command . It 's all my fault . I don 't buy that . Unless more happened back then ... So , what happened back then ? - I have to talk to him . - Aeryn ! - I 'll go . - No , no , no . I 'm already into this ! - No , I can talks some sense into both of them . - D 'Argo , no .. look ... - See ya . - I can 't believe it . The DRD 's are definitely in a defensive posture . What are you planning on saying to Pilot that you think is going to make a difference ? You were right ... this is about the past , and he 's remembering more and more about those days . I 'm the only one who could possibly understand , so I figure , if I can get him to talk about it ... it might help . - So , you thing that talking will help ? - Mm - hmm . Why don 't you talk to me ? Come on , Aeryn . Let me know . What 's got you so torn up about what happened ? Aeryn . What happened with Velorek ? It 's just you and me and the walls in here . I have finished my assignment here . I 'm going to be reassigned soon . I want to go with you . You mean that ? What about flying ... prowlers ? I 've been through all the accepted channels of command ... without something to single me out , they 'll never listen to me . I 'll can make this as exciting for you as flying any prowler could ever be . I promise . Where would we go ? What does it matter ? Somewhere else . I don 't know how to live somewhere else . You only say that because this is all you 've ever known , in the right new place , you 'll thrive . Change you mind . What ? Whatever you did with Crais ' plan , put it back . What are you talking about , Aeryn ? Aeryn , what is this about ? What have you done ? What is the meaning of this ! ? What do you think it is , Velorek ? You 're under arrest . - On what charge ? - Treason , of course , we can find no evidence of your attempts to sabotage my project . I think we may have caught you before you were able to do your damage . I assume you are the informant ? Yes , Captain . Officer Aeryn Sun . Just contact Lieutenant Teeg . She will see that you are rewarded with the assignment you requested . Prowler detail , sir . Whatever . Bring him . You found that something special to single yourself out with . Congratulations , Aeryn . No ordinary Peacekeeper would have attempted this . I told you , you were special ... I got my duty . And what happened to Velorek ? But they never got him to talk . He never told them what he 'd done to sabotage Crais ' plan . But I think I know now . It was Crais ' plan to impregnate a leviathan ... Moya . To breed a Peacekeeper Leviathan Warship . Velorek installed the shield to prevent conception . The shield that D 'Argo accidentally shattered . It 's no use . There must be some way to get Moya to help us . No , there isn 't . All interior life support is in Pilot 's hands . Not anymore . Even if we can communicate directly with Moya , there is nothing she can do on her own . Just my luck , out of all the leviathans in the universe , I end up aboard one with a second string Pilot . And how do we know Moya 's first Pilot was any better ? Pilot ! No ! Get out of my chamber ! Leave me alone ! No , Pilot . We need to talk . Talk ? You want a chance to tell me how non - violent you are now . Or what ? You 'll blast me into pieces like you did the Pilot who used to sit here ? - Stay away from me ! - Aeryn ! Tell me now , Pilot ! Talk to me right now , or I swear , I will ... Pilot ... we 're just here to help . If you stay disconnected from Moya , you 'll starve to death . And with no one to regulate them , your precious life support systems won 't function properly . Fine , fine ... yes . We all want you back in the seat . And Moya must be pretty worried , wondering where the hell you got to . Doesn 't matter . She 'll be better off without me . That recording brought back memories of a time none of us wanted to remember . Based on my actions back then , I deserve to die , and if you wish to kill me , right now ... I 'm not going to stop you . But please , spare the others ... and yourself . Aeryn Sun ... It is not you who deserves death . It is I. Okay , so you 're not Moya 's original Pilot , you replaced her ... you can 't blame yourself for that . I didn 't only ... replace the old Pilot . The elders have already judged me . They said I was not yet ... worthy to pilot a Leviathan . If you believed that , you wouldn 't be here right now . So , why are you here ? I want to be joined so badly ... I can make that happen , young one . But the elders ... the elders have not yet decreed it to be my destiny . I offer you the chance to make your destiny . Look up . What do you see ? The stars ! That is what I offer you ... the stars . I dream of nothing else . I offer you a Leviathan . All you have to do is agree to help me . But ... you said that for me to be joined , the old one would have to die . That Pilot will die no matter what you do . If you don 't come with me , I 'll find someone else who will . Someone who isn 't afraid to take their place amongst the stars . The fate of Moya 's true Pilot was sealed at that moment ... So you see , Aeryn ... it wasn 't really you who caused her death ... it was ... me . If I hadn 't agreed to come , Velorek may never have found a replacement Pilot . But ... But I just wanted so desperately to see the stars . Do you remember when you first came aboard Moya ? Velorek stroked your cheek like this to calm you . Back then , I couldn 't fathom why he would do a thing like that ... and now , I couldn 't fathom not doing it . We 've come a long way since then , Pilot . And we 've still got a long way to go ... Take the journey ... with me . I ... I know a procedure ... Some temporary connections that ... can be made that will give me back rudimentary control of Moya 's systems . Okay , lets ' get started ... Those temporary connections you 've made are working just fine . You realize ... if you finish what you 're doing now ... allowing me to bond with Moya naturally , it could take an entire cycle before the process is complete . During the bonding period , I won 't have as much control of Moya 's systems as I had before . It will make it even more tenuous for all of us . It doesn 't matter , Pilot . You deserve to be bonded to Moya naturally . I will work hard to deserve it . I 'm finished . How does it feel ? There 's no pain . No longer any pain . Velorek said that he 'd always remember you . And you , have you ... ? He said that in the right new place , I would thrive . He was right . You know . That time when he asked me to go with him , he said , " You can be so much more . " That was exactly what you said to me on the first day I was here . And you ... say you think ... you love this man ?

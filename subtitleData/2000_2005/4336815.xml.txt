 Futurama [ 3x09 ] - The Birdbot Of Ice-Catraz - CiWaN Those cookies are fresh-A-Licious , but they produce a lot of trash . That head spray makes your antenna smell nice . Thank you . But it 's damaging the planet . So ? It 's not the only one we 've got . Good news ! I 'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission . Controversial ? Oh , my , no . For this highly controversial mission , you 'll be towing the Juan Valdez An orbiting supertanker full of Colombian dark matter . Oil ? What if we hit something , and the tanker leaks ? Lmpossible . The tanker has 6000 hulls . So , unlike me , it 's entirely leakproof . Once you 've hauled the tanker past the protestors ... Protestors ? Correct . Six thousand hulls . Why do we fly within three feet of this penguin preserve ? To avoid the tollbooth . She 's restocked with emergency jam . Let 's get going . At the risk of sounding negative , no . I can 't participate in this mission . What are you yapping about ? Your reckless disregard for the environment ! I 'm gonna join those protestors . This is an outrage . I demand you hand over your captain 's jacket . This is my normal jacket . I 've had it 10 years . I said , hand it over . Well , Fry , or should I say Captain Fry ? No , I shouldn 't . Bender is the new captain . Bender ? That 's right . Being captain is about intuition and heart . A good captain can 't have either . That 's why cold , logical Bender is perfect for the job . I do think of human life as expendable . No fair ! Leela was training me to be captain . She let me sit on her lap and steer , in this comic I drew . The new one 's out ! The title of captain may inflate the human ego ... But it 's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-Logic . Now , look spry , men . We launch at six bells . Greetings . I 'm Free Waterfall Sr. , founder of Penguins Unlimited . No applause . When you clap your hands ... You kill thousands of spores that 'll someday form a nutritious fungus . Just show your approval with a mold-Friendly thumbs up . Please hold your thumbs until the end . It 's time to stop that tanker with a nonviolent human circle . Why resort to nonviolence ? Can 't we kick their asses ? Little lady , those people 's asses are living things too . We 're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones ' U-Haul . At ease , men . I am at ease . I like to give my first mate an informal nickname . From now on , you 'll be known as Wiggles . The hell I will . Have you even read the captain 's handbook ? I have now . What 's Peter Parrot 's first rule of captaining ? " Always respect the chain o ' command , " captain . Correct , Wiggles . You 've just earned an invitation to the captain 's table . The captain 's table ? What an honor . Our peace ring has them trapped like a tiger in a washing machine . Get ready . Look at that . Here they come . Didn 't you realize spaceships can move in three dimensions ? No , I did not . That tanker gave us the slip , but we 'll stop them here on Pluto . If you 're cold , rub your bodies with permafrost . It 's nature 's long johns . If rubbing dirt in your crotch is wrong , I don 't wanna be right . This here is our penguin preserve . They 're so cute , like if puppies and kittens could have babies . We use hand puppets around young ones to simulate a natural environment . That 's adorable . Ow ! It 's this medal I 'm most proud of . I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo . It was on Australian news . You didn 't see it . Brilliant . Would you cram a sock in it ? Those aren 't even medals . They 're bottle caps and pepperoni slices . Thank you , steward . Weren 't you about to toast your gallant captain ? Fine , I 've got a toast . To Captain Bender . He 's the best ... At being a jerk , and his ugly face is as dumb as a butt . I 've heard better . If I were in charge , I wouldn 't treat you like this . You 're nothing but a blowhard . Sir , you forget yourself . Shut up . Being captain is more important to you than being my friend . I 'm going . Going ? But a captain can 't drink without his first mate . You can drink with me , maybe ? I don 't feel like drinking . Then if you 'll excuse me ... I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it . Three . Oh , Greenland is a barren land a land that bears no green ... Where there 's ice and snow , and the whale fiishies blow ... Please have some liquor . Robots need alcohol to function . I once knew a guy ... You look like him . He wasn 't neither ... I 'm a good captain . Please , I love you like a father ! Oh , I hope they read my sign ! Bender 's too low and upside down . He must be talking on a cell phone . What 's happening ? All 6000 hulls have been breached . Fools . If only they 'd built it with 6001 hulls . When will they learn ? Continuing our coverage of a tragic , but faraway , story . The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads . The images are truly horrifiic . I don ' t think any of us can understand how those poor penguins feel . Oily humanoid . At the time of the crash , the captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent ... Well below the legal limit for robots . As your lawyer , I declare y 'all are in a 12-Piece bucket of trouble . But I struck you a deal . Five hours of community service ... Cleaning up that mess . Five hours ? Couldn 't you have just gotten me the death penalty ? I 'd have done better , but it 's hard pleading a case ... While awaiting trial for incompetence . Good luck with that . Now , you stay away from those Puffin twins . To avoid frostbite , put your hands between your buttocks . That 's nature 's pocket . I 'll check on Bender . Watch so he doesn 't pick your pocket . Can 't beat fresh-Squeezed . Bender , can you at least pretend you 're being punished ? Clean the black parts too . Are they black with white feathers ... Or white with black feathers ? Don 't matter . They 're all beautiful . Yo , screws , more Tegrin over here . What 's this ? Man , he got away . This is why chief says no hugging . Good work , everyone . I suggest you get some sleep . I 'm gonna stay up singing songs about penguins in a fine , piercing tenor . Has anyone seen Bender ? Bender ! Here robot , robot , robot . Why weren 't you Kong donkeys cleaning up ? They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job . And eating penguin eggs . You ate most of them . Where 's Captain Bender ? Off catastrophizing some other planet ? Damn it , Fry ! He 's still your captain ! He didn 't come back with the group . He didn 't ? No . It 's 20 degrees below absolute zero . I better go find him . Wait . Bender and I have disagreements , but we 're still friends ... And I 'm gonna show him what that means . To the ship . Why don 't you walk ? He was only 20 yards from here . Madam , I am in command now . Such a man . I 'd follow him to hell and back , I would . What the ... ? What 's this water made of , ice ? Forget this ! I don 't think we 're on Pluto . We may have left space as we know it . Then where are we ? You said you knew how to navigate . Stop yelling at me . It 's worse than we thought . It seems dark matter is nature 's sex drug . It 's like a mix of penguin estrogen , penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly . It 's making them ultrafertile . How ultra ? A garden-Variety penguin lays one egg a year . Since the spill , our penguins lay six eggs every 15 minutes ! Also , the eggs hatch in only 12 hours ! Also , the males are laying eggs ! This man has overgasped ! Soon , there will be too many birds to count . Before long , they will exhaust their food supply and starve to death . If only we hadn 't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them . Can 't we stop them from multiplying ? Yes . Thankfully , we have a plan . What is it ? We 'll do anything ! Grab your guns . I declare penguin hunting season officially open ! Isn 't there some way to keep them from breeding ? Cold showers don 't work on Antarctic creatures . Surely , a quick semipainless death is better than weeks of starvation . Well , I suppose . But I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins , not hunt them . The two are one and the same . Now , are you with us , or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer ? Oh , God , it 's inhuman ! It 's like Hong Kong ! I 'll do it ! That 's a good old-Fashioned gun . Rifle check ! Oh , yeah ! Wee doggy ! You 're enjoying this ! Look , if you have to shoot penguins , you might as well enjoy it . Sorry , if it 's fun in any way , it 's not environmentalism . Really ? How about blowing up dams ? Yeah , that is fun . Let 's conservate ! It 's been an honor to serve under you ! This is for their own good . Don 't leave orphans . Gotta kill entire families . They 're so cute . No ! You can do this . It 's like murdering a little butler . I can 't look . Oh , no ! What have I done ? ! You poor little guy ! I 'm so sorry l ... Bender ? ! Were you hiding out with these guys ? Of course not ! Filthy ice rats ! Scat ! Shoo ! What are you doing ? Get away ! They love you . Well , I don 't love them . Aw . I don 't know why , but when I look at their faces ... It makes me want to puke ! In a good way . Stop ! Stop shooting ! It 's me ! Leela ! Sorry . Why aren 't you firing at them ? Don 't you want to help them ? Not this way . You 're not a tree-Hugging kook at all ! I don 't know if shooting penguins will help or not . But the decision shouldn 't be in the hands of people who kill just for fun . You may just be farming some free-Range truth there . But we already made 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura . Okay , boys , it 's them or us ! No ! Where did they ... ? Attack ! Make sure they use every part of my body ! I 'll avenge your death , son ! They used to be peaceful . I suppose this was your doing ? I taught them if it ain 't black and white , peck and bite . Now , to take off my tuxedo ... Guys , it 's me , your lovable dictator ! Uh-Oh . If only we had a toboggan ! Faster ! Faster ! Ooh , phew . Phew . Right , they can swim . It 's all coming back to me now . It 's Fry ! Wiggles ? At least it 'll help reduce their population . Yeah , life is hilariously cruel . Permission to come aboard ? Granted . We can 't take off without our captain . Ahem . And bring my toboggan . Were you able to help the penguins ? Sure . I mean , not really . Nature will work itself out . It can 't screw up any worse than we did , right ? I don 't know . Quit worrying ! Thanks to my influence , those stupid birds will do just fine .

Help me blame myself rather than accusing someone else ... Help me see my sins rather than criticize other people ... Give me wisdom and courage to fight against the evils ... Let my body be the embodiment of your power ... As I walked the sacred place , with great noise the 7 angels appeared ... " Go back to the Earth and knock over the seven bowls of God 's wrath ...

[ Wonjang ] Manager of the " Angels House " Both the president of the association of the keepers of virginity and vice-president of the organization for the protection of the teenagers . In case of emergency come to the waterfront next to the market . Choopung . Since I haven 't got my ID , I can 't eat or buy weapons anymore . I am running , fuck , I 'm going crazy ! What should I do ? Should I die like this ? You know the price per minute for my information ... You told me to throw my ID away ! Hey kid , I saved your life . How dare you ... Go to Odeng , ask him for a mackerel . Arrest the Little Match Girl alive , we have to reprogram her . We see the girl machine , gunning people around tzeu tzeu tzeu ... It 's so cool , she fires without reserve ! - She 's cute ! - She 's really cute ! L.M.G. , I love you ! Disperse ! Disperse ! Disperse ! Take him to the hospital right away . Don 't shoot ! Can you take another taxi ? I am off-duty for today ... Starting the meter ... I have many mouths to feed ... Taxi 78 ... 78 ... - Move your gun off me ! - Taxi 78 ... - We have a serious situation ! - Taxi 78 ... - What 's happening ? - Taxi 78 ... I warn you , taxi 78 ... Stop it ! Stop it ! Can 't you hear , stop now ! Bastards , they order me to stop . I 've been driving already back when they were still in diapers and they dare to command me ! Hey you bastards , how old are you ? Miss , don 't you worry . Who I am ? I 'm a real pilot . All the taxis know me . Here we go ... Catch me ! Look a this , they can 't even drive ! You 're prettier than on TV ... Are you the Match Girl ? You know , you 're famous among us cabbies , we think you 're beautiful ... We may even create a fan club ... Miss , aren 't we getting on well together ? The two of us ? I have an idea ... What do you say , we work together ? She 's gone ! Up there ! A mackerel . Give me a mackerel ! Where do you come from ? Choopung sent me . Sir , did you forget about my Kimbap ? Hurry up ! We must take her alive . Approach without firing until she runs out of ammunition . - Now she 's aiming at her own head ! - Wait ! Back off ! - Why can 't you just capture her ? - We can hardly approach her ! I think her machine gun is empty . But we can 't be sure about the hand gun . She threatens to blow her head off if the soldiers come closer . Let me go up and convince her . I 'll check if she has any bullets left . What ? In that case , she 'll shoot me . She hates me . O.K. Don 't follow me . Here he comes , we 're moving towards her . I don 't mind dying . I 'd rather die at your hands ! But I didn 't kill the singer ... What killed him ... was the System . Kill Oh Sadness ! The killer L.M.G. is arrested and sent to the System . As both sides of this road are protected by the canal and the swamp , we can only get inside through this way . I think that breaking in through the main entrance is best . Once inside , your destiny depends on the yellow doors you pick . We know neither the inside topology nor the material it is made of . We have no precise information on the internal structure . Choopung created it , but nobody knows the System . It is perfect . - Aren 't you Choopung ? - Yes . True , I created it , but there 's no border between the game and the real life . For real and unreal are continuously intertwining . Like the climate , the System changes and recreates itself . Sure the mackerel will help you . But it is not efficient inside . The odds to get into the System 's core are ... 1 to over 100 000 . With luck ! Ah , it 's deadly ! You must communicate with the L.M.G. by telepathy until you see her . It 's the only force that will guide you inside the System . A kind of a spiritual language ... You must acquire telepathic ability of a higher level . That 's why I chose you . Steady your heart ... until everything is still . Fishing is the best way to reach this state . Do not use bait . Once your heart is serene everything reflects in your mind . Catch the fish with your heart . Forget everything , even the girl ... so that nothing disturbs your heart . Just watch the hook ... Master Choopung ! I did it ! With no bait ! Here 's the legendary Mackerel ... It 's pseudonym is MACKEREL . Mackerel ! 108 , 108 , 108 ... The weapon can fire 108 times . Of course this depends on the shooter . But save her ernergy ... for the unexpected . - Keep my words in mind . - It 's only a toy ! True , it used to be a toy . It 's easier to hide this way . The important thing ... The batteries ! Batteries ... Light ! Wind ! The power of light ... Of wind ... Energies that are never used up , like nature itself . It 's a joke ! Its power is connected to its owner 's heart . Which means ... Which means ... Its power is the reflection of its owner 's spirit ! In fact , the spirit and the material make one . That 's why the mackerel has no trigger . - There 's no trigger ? - Sure . Choopung ! Nice to see you . They located our position ! The lighthouse is surrounded . Surrender peacefully . - Take the gun and go ! - What about you ? I have something to finish here first . Hurry ! Get out ! 5 seconds before explosion ! Do you want to erase and blow the system ? Odeng ! What about master Choopung ? You show up at the right time ! Sis ! You look good . So you reconnected ? What ? Bastard If not for Odeng , I 'd be dead ! Forgive me ! Where are you going ? You left me dying ! Asshole ! Don 't you know who I am ? Lara , cut it out ! If not for Odeng you 'd be dead by now ! Odeng saved my life . Hurry up ! Good bye ! - And you ? Aren 't you coming ? - I 'll sell " Odengs " ... - Brother Odeng ! - What ? Call me Big Brother . Big Brother , is Master dead ? Hurry up ! Get in now ! Good luck to you ! Big Brother , goodbye ! Access Forbidden - Sis , how does it work ? - Shut up ! What are you doing ? I 'm driving now . - Hey , are they all dead ? - You 're deadly ! Me ? You try it ! Try for yourself ! I never used such a thing ... Didn 't you practice on video games ? Go on . It 's the same thing . - Can 't find a thing like this in the game centers ! - Hey , throw grenades first ! What was that ? Ma .. ma ... mackerel ! Jump ! - Lara ! - You should have used it earlier ! Never mind . Go ! Hurry up ! - Lara ? - Go ! I can reconnect . If they come , it 's all over . Hurry ! Save the girl ! Good bye ... Lara ... Strange ! How come he never loses direction ? It 's the girl ! She 's communicating . Increase the correction level ! Lee ! It 's me . Joo ! It 's me ! Hey ... - Are you mad ? - It 's only a game . Think it 's only a game ? I 've let you go because of our friendship ... You are my friend ? Fuck you ! Fuck ! I almost died ! Joo ! You 'll never be up to my skills to kill me ! I am sorry , but you must die . Goodbye , my friend ! It 's me who 's sorry . You 'll be my hostage . Walk in front of me if you don 't want me to kill you . Stop ! Why are you running ? You think that I 'll kill you ? Walk ! Walk ! I said walk , you bastard ! Let him in ... So , you made it here . Congratulations ! You 're a great gamer . You 're the first one to get here . But it is too late . The reprogramming of L.M.G. has been completed . She will not even recognize you . Hee-Mi ... So , do you want to reconnect ? But remember . You can never come back here . Thanks to you , we have found and killed Choopung . You 've been of great help . I thank you . Do you have something to say , Virus ? Save the girl 's life ! She will not die . She will just live as the Little Match Girl . Take the Girl away ! Hee-Mi ... Ending N ¬∞ 2 : " The Last Obstacle " Start again ? ( yes / no ) Fuck ! I almost made it ! Miss ... What was your rank ? N ¬∞ 1 . Three dollars , please . Goodbye . Option 1 The Crappy Ending Version Option 2 The Happy Ending Version Do you have something to say , Virus ? Can I give her the lighter back ? It 's no use to me now ... That is kind of you . I allow it . You sold me this lighter . Now take it back ... I love you . Take the girl away . Kill this man right away . So he can never reconnect again . Hee-Mi ! She doesn 't remember anything . Is this her good fortune or bad ? How did we survive ? Maybe Odeng prepared a boat for us ? And then we changed for a bigger boat ? Or did we take a ship ? I think I saw a ship ... Maybe we 're not even on Earth ? We were given no names , there are no names here . What day is it today ? But , a lot of money is wired to our bank account by the System . Then perhaps we 're on Earth after all . Anyway , we 're happy . Director JANG Sun-Woo Subtitles by Soojin Jae [ corrected by astgtciv ]

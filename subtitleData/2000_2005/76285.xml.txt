 Wait for me ! That day you ? A charming leaf . She 's not young anymore . She looks up at me fondly . She 's my sister . Switzerland , the near future - laughing at another 's misfortune ? - Not at all . I laugh because ... tomorrow is the best day of my life . Really ? How do you know ? Scientific proof ! It 's done . All the data fits . The data ? The runes have spoken . Tomorrow is the best day of my life . - What runes ? - Actually , the most important day . That 's not the same . Really not the same . You 're right ... i 'll write that down . Not the same . Not the same at all . - So the runes spoke ? - Yes . Three times in a row . Very important . Three times , the same thing . And not just the runes . I 'm not that naive . Other indications are needed . The l-ching said exactly the same thing . And the tarot and the aztec astrology . But you already know that since you 're an angel . Me ? Does it show ? Of course . Careful of the mud ! Water ! Water ! Pointpoirot ! Picnic 's over . Time to go home ! Come on , hurry up ! Wait for me ! Wait ! I hate crossing the san michele insane . Why speak of the insane ? I beg your pardon . You said insane . Yes , those insane men on bicycles . So ? I don 't understand . Explain ... are you ok ? Feeling alright ? I feel just fine . Wait . You 're an angel ! You 're an angel ... first , my sister . Where is she ? Here she is ! I guess i should explain . No , that 's ok ... have a nice day . Come here , i can explain . Come here . I 'll show you something . Come here ! See ? - Isn 't that unfair ? - Yes . Go on . Touch it . Not like that . With your mouth . Treffle ! It 's treffle ! Sunday , december 27 . 12 : 30 tomorrow 's the best day of her life ? Don 't laugh , roland ... the runes said so . - I saw it with my own eyes . - And the l-ching and tarot ! Lunch is served in 5 minutes . Is it interesting ? What ? Stop it , luc . Just kidding . I hope so . No arguing . He wouldn 't like that . But it 's not even 12 : 45 . In fact , that 's our dear harald ... he 's on time or doesn 't show at all . Could something serious have come up ? Yes , yes ... finally . You said it ... come inside . Little duck ! The wing is named bride . The thigh is named vagabond . The other wing ... livia ! He 's man in velvet ... the neck is tightrope walker . Stop that , will you ! Now , bernadette ... you upset livia . You hurt her . Livia is an adult . She 's aware . Livia is a poet . She dreams . Indeed ! She took her time learning to read . Remember , livia ? D ... o ... do ... what 's next ? Do ... or ... that spells ? Door . Three years to learn to read ! So what , bernadette ? Maybe she didn 't want to learn with you . Your method was archaic . No arguing . Where did that horse come from ? Bernadette , please don 't start ! It 's your fault , roland . What 's wrong with her ? She 's thinking about the accident . It 's an obsession . Bernadette , i 'm sorry . Hubus doesn 't feel well . Neither do i . Don 't always copy your friend hubus . This mimicry is unbearable . My friend ? What an idea ! We hardly know each other . It 's him ! Yes , dear , we 're all here . He sends you his best . He can 't come , he 's on a plane . We 're all thinking of you , dear . Happy birthday ! Feel better , hubus ? Much better . I love your name . Why ? You think it 's funny ? Not at all . It sounds like it comes from your eyeball . From my eyeball ? That doesn 't make sense . From your eyeball . From my eyeball ? Let 's see ... eye-ball ... i ... ball ... time for laure magloire . Oh , god ! - Stay seated . - You know i can 't ! What 's wrong with her ? The laure magloire show . Her favorite television program . She can 't miss it . Stay for me , livia . I can 't , roland . I promise to visit more often . Please , roland ... - still love me ? - Of course . Love me ? Yes . - Love me ? - Yes . - Love you , too . Can i ? - Stop ! Stop it ! You 're tickling me ! What did the doctor say ? Normal . - Said she was normal . - He did not . He said locking her up wasn 't necessary . Monday , december 28 . 7 : 00 am so ? Nothing . Today 's the big day . I can 't believe it . It 's true . The hour has come . God decides . I don 't feel ready today . That 's a pity . Don 't worry . I 'll still go . Still . It 's what god wants . You said it . How will i get out ? Everyone 's asleep . The doors are open . Well , if it 's what god wants . Hey ! I forgot it again . It can 't be . Oh lord , i 'm unforgivable ! Maybe i can be of help ? I 'm going on a long trip . - Forgot your medicine ? - No , no . Yes , i 'm a diabetic . I don 't have my blood sugar meter . Lost your head , i see . I 'll fix you up . I lost my head . That 's it . Lost my head ... Yes , that 's it . Precise , fast , reliable . Goodbye , livia . - Have fun . - Thanks , luc . - Above all , be happy . - I already am . See you next week , livia ! The merge of moriendi , sound star and salsox is expected today . The new multinational will be taken over by faxig , carpax , rondo moraese libertas . Salsox already owns 51 % of rib and rem . Rr controls 61 % of afghan oil . Also the drinking water of brazil , bolivia and patagonia . Psychopath emil pointpoirot escaped this morning from san michele . He was last seen at st georges pharmacy . Police are thoroughly investigating . This morning 's expected temperature is a low of 1 ° and a high of 4 ° by noon . Morning , vogel . Morning , chief . - Is ritter in ? - Yes . He was early . He was in when i arrived . What are you doing ? Cleaning the stamps . Got a cramp ? A cramp . - Morning , ritter . - Morning , chief . Bottom line , all the doors were open . Yes , chief . Surprising . And only pointpoirot escaped ? Yes . Equally surprising . That merits reflection . Yes , chief . I already started . Well , let 's go . Cramp ? Cramp . I have an idea . Good . You 'll be surprised . It better be good . It is , chief . What is it ? Do nothing . What ? Do nothing , chief . That 's no idea , ritter . That 's reality . We can 't do anything . With mister harald around , absolutely nothing can be done . We 'll just have to pretend . No , chief . We pretend to do nothing . Everyone should believe we want to do nothing at all . But on the contrary , we work underhandedly in the shadows . That 's not your style . It 's from my seminary years . Do nothing ... what does that mean to you ? First , we don 't visit the asylum . We don 't ask them questions . We act like there was no escape . Interesting . - But pointpoirot is dangerous . - I know . Cramp ? Cramp . What do you think of mister harald ? He also acts like he does nothing . What do you think he 's hiding ? That he 's ruined . All washed up . But he admits that . He announced it last sunday at the veterans ' annual lunch . And who believed it ? No one . True . That 's what he wanted . Chief ... the asylum called . They 're waiting . Call them . Tell them we 're not going . What ? No . We 're much too busy . I said you were having coffee . That 's right . Then we 'll play billiards . And then we have to read newspapers . So you 'll go after reading ? No , man . - After , it will be lunch time . - True . Funny how time flies . That 's it . Tell them time flies . " Escapee " in 11 letters ? Pointpoirot . Thanks . Daddy ! I 'm so happy to hear you . So happy . Are you coming ? Come , because today is a special day . That 's what i hear . The runes , daddy ! And tarot , i know . You know everything . Have they left ? Yes , they left . Daddy , come to me like before . Remember ? We don 't talk about that anymore . I miss you . Me , too . Goodbye . The heiress is happy . Today 's the best day of her life . Poor thing . Luc ! Yes , father ? Does she know ? - About what ? - Her inheritance . - No . - She 's protected . She 'll never know . So be it . Yes , mister harald . Bad news . It 's your mother . Mother ? What happened ? Nothing serious . She 's not well . She called me . She wants to see you . Tell me the truth ... she 's dead , isn 't she ? No . Her dog was killed . She 's upset . Soliman was killed ? Who could have done that ? I have no idea . Listen , she asked me , begged me to let you go and see her . Go on , i 'm giving you leave . I 'm ashamed , sir . Thank you so much . But what about the little miss ? She can 't stay alone . She 's an adult . But ... treffle , your mother needs you . Go ! Who could have killed soliman ? I don 't know . Maybe that escaped madman . Don 't waste time , man . Hear me ? Yes , mister harald . All the best to your mother . You 're welcome . Goodbye . - Treffle has to go out . - I understand . Go keep your sister company . What 's happening ? Look at me ! Alright , father . - In one hour . - Understood . Well ... i 'm going . If you need me , i 'm at the office . Agreed . What 's happening ? Nothing . Nothing 's happening . I don 't like being followed . Miss , i 'll be back soon . Until then , be reasonable . - Don 't get in trouble . - Yes , treffle . Even when i 'm away from you ... my eyes are on you . - Remember that . - Yes , treffle . Be virtuous . You 're crying ... no , but ... i hate abandoning you here in this house where the devil roams . Pray for yourself , miss . Pray . You 're so good , treffle . - Is this here ? - That 's here . Praise god . Who are you ? I remember you ... i saw you yesterday . You were ... yes , with the others . Yes , you 're ... i 'm insane . Don 't say that word . I don 't like it . A real storm under there ! You 're an angel ! I have a theory about angels . Those who fall are angels . You fell , so you 're an angel . I do this every hour . I 'm diabetic . That 's still ok . Dear stranger . How incredibly kind of you to call ! I 'm so very appreciative . Alas , i 'm absent . Be assured , life goes on . I 'm somewhere in the world . Inevitably , sooner or later i 'll be back to hear your message . I 'll look for you wherever you are . You 'll see what you 'll see ! That 's it ! It 's in the bag . You 're not a good player , ritter . But i won . But you 're still not a good player . Are you annoyed , chief ? Just making a point . You always win . Your mind is ahead of the game . Understand ? I lose because my mind is precisely on the game . Contemporarily , if you will . Evidently something to reflect on . Did you see ? Sorry . See that ? Hubus with bernadette harald ! We saw , we saw . What does that mean ? That they want it known . What ? They want people to ask what that means . Some distance , ritter . You 're going too far ahead . They simply want to confirm what everyone is thinking . What does everyone think , morelli ? I don 't know . - But you told me ... - logic ! San michele has only two rich guys . One is ruined . The other ... the other will be . Unless ... unless he comes up with something . I don 't get it . I 'm too inside , too contemporary . Something really profitable , chief . Nice word . Unless ... yes ? Now , i 'm only an amateur . Even better . Tell us . Unless harald going bankrupt is actually something profitable . Evidently something to reflect on . I hate that noise . What ? Billiards . It gives me goosebumps . I was going to say that . Incredible . We 're made ... - we 're made ... - for each other ? No , not that . We 're made like each other . Real spiritual twins . You mean one can 't redeem the other ? I 'm not very religious . Hubus ! You think it 's done ? Yes . And that means ? The moment has come . The moment has come . Morelli ! Coming ! Yes ? One salsox , please . A what ? You heard me . Exactly . Well , then ? You know mister harald forbids salsox in this restaurant . You mean mister harald rules this restaurant ? He wishes . I don 't care about his whims . I want a salsox . That 's all . - We don 't have any . - What ? No more salsox ? No more salsox . Maggi maybe ... no way . With your permission ... there 's a real man amongst the sheep ! Don 't think that , mr hubus . We 're all ready , if necessary . I don 't expect anything less . 1 , 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 , 6 ... 7 , 8 ... 9 , 10 ... 11 , 12 ... see ? No more salsox . No more salsox . Miss ? Miss , that hammer ... what ? Which hammer ? This ? What happened ? Something serious , i suppose . No , everything 's fine . I 'm so happy . Especially since you 're here . Come , come inside . How ? You 're an angel . That 's not nice . Not nice . That 's not nice ! You always do that ? I must . It could rise instantly . I didn 't scare you a while ago ? No . 178 is fine . Not too bad . It shouldn 't go higher than 200 . There 's ketone over 250 . Ketone ? How pretty ! Ketone is dangerous . Really ? Very dangerous . I 'm telling you , it could go far . Legs must be cut off sometimes . That 's not good . The door 's wide open . Nothing strange . Yes , we 'll go inside . Yes , " we . " bernadette is here . She wanted to come along . She does what she wants . She 's an adult . 83 ... he 's normal . My turn ! Help ! Help ! Hubus ! That wasn 't me . Not me . Help ! Help ! So long ! Everything 's beautiful ! So long ! Stains ... full of stains . Won 't go away ... won 't go , won 't go . Hello . What 's your name ? Emil . No accent and no final e . Emil pointpoirot . I 'm livia . You 're a killer , from what i see . That 's what some say . Do you kill everyone ? Sometimes . Are you insane ? Sometimes . But you 're an angel ! An angel ... you 're hurt . A little , yes . Is it me ? Yes , yes . But i need some aspirin . Can i brush your hair ? Yes . In the asylum , there 's mlton . Miton is insane . He knows two colors . White and red . He checks his blood sugar . That 's red . And he looks out the window . Only white . Like on the asylum tv . Only snow . That 's his white . Since he 's very dangerous ... he gets double servings of potatoes . That 's his joy . Sometimes the asylum doors are open . He goes out and he erases . Once he erased a family of tourists . Mistake . Later , no mistake . He slit a venezuelan ambassador 's throat . Success ! He was given a nice tv . With snow , like the asylum 's . He goes out often . Hey , isn 't that insane mlton ? Yes , insane mlton . How 's mlton ? Fine , fine . Want some coffee ? No caffeine . I 'm a diabetic . - Some tea ? - No . Some water mixed with red wine . Actually , without the water . Is that " ave maria " ? Something 's not right . Better go and take a look . Yes , father . Alert leone . About what ? Nothing . You think it 's done ? What ? Nothing , father . You and i know nothing . God decides . Yes , father . Go see what 's happening . What are you reading ? Market pages . You play the stock market ? I read the values . Are they good ? Harald stock is dropping . That 's what they say . But it 's questionable . What ? What do you mean ? I 'm talking about the rich guys . All that will change , thanks to the inheritance . Funny how we never think about inheritance . Because we 'll never inherit anything . Luckily . They talked about that earlier ? I think so . I don 't stretch my ears . Tough times in argentina ... chief ... harald orders you to check his home . Can 't he go himself ? We have things to do . Yeah , we have things to do . Plus , it 's lunch time . That 's true . I forgot . We 'll send someone out there later , if it 's necessary . Yeah , only if it 's necessary . He 'll complain , i 'm telling you . He 'll complain no matter what . That 's true . Have a nice lunch . Émile ... - your name is émile . - No . Emil . No accent and no final e . I almost forgot . No one calls me emil . Everyone calls me pointpoirot . That 's so horrible : Pointpoirot . I think it 's funny . I can 't stand the idea of being funny . I can 't stand it . Drives me insane . Actually , i am insane . I find it funny . Funny as an angel . Do you believe in angels ? I believe in angels . I profoundly believe . You know ... i see people 's angels . I look at people , i see their angels . So clearly that i see two beings . One is already dead . The other , an immortal angel . I only bother with angels . Sometimes , there is no angel . It 's sad when there 's no angel . Don 't you think so ? You 're elsewhere ? Be nice and tell me why you 're here . I don 't know you . Where are we ? Say something . But what ? I don 't know . People generally speak . I don 't speak . I only write . That 's nice . What ? Poems ? No , just things . I 'd love to read them . It 's all here . You won 't understand anything . It 's true . I don 't understand . Only people 's names ! Me ... when i see a tree , i name it horace . When i see a house , i name it ... ours . You 're a poet , emil . You think so ? What 's wrong , emil ? Livia ... you 're livia ? I was told terrible things about you . Who said them ? - He did . - Who ? My buddy , the one who lets me out when things are bad . But i did nothing to him . He 's someone important . He speaks to god . In reality , it 's god who decides . Of course , god decides . Of course . But god loves me , you know . Really ? Of course . Believe me ! Then my friend messed up . Sorry . But he never messes up . Well , this time , yes . You 're here ! Roland ... there you are . Are you ok ? Yes , i 'm fine . Everything 's fine . I was afraid for you . I 'm fine . I 'm happy . Well ... are they dead ? It seems so . God called them to his holy kingdom . But they 're fine up there , roland . They 're fine and happy . Run ! It 's emil ! Emil ... that 's not nice what you do . It was self-defense . True , roland did try to kill you . I admit sometimes he isn 't nice . But he 's still my brother . We grew up together . True , he 's been acting strange lately . He was brutish . Maybe god saw that . What do you think ? Of course . It got really high ... 270 . Is that bad ? Very bad . It 's very serious . It 's the ketone . Yes , the ketone ... i need red wine . He 's normal . 74 is normal . He 's normal , too . So you refuse to check my home ? We don 't have time . A dangerous lunatic ! Roaming about ! A killer and rapist . You know very well ! According to dr gallard , he 's cured . According to him , my daughter 's sane ! - Isn 't she ? - No . She 's fragile . She needs protection . Do it yourself . You can afford to . It 's your job to protect citizens ! We do that , mister harald . Better worry about your asylum . This isn 't the first escape . We 'll check on that later . That 's it , sir . Later . Have a nice lunch ! Thank you ... see you later . I 'm in trouble , leone . We 're together . Two mouths eat more than one . You 're not ruined . Not to that point . Ruined . To that point . - I don 't believe you . - Believe me . You have your reputation , friends ... - that 's worse . - You have your daughter . Her inheritance ... Damned rachel ! - You said it . - Damned rachel ! Still hate her ? No . Still love her ? She 's my daughter 's mother . - Why did you leave her ? - She cheated on me . - Is that all ? - Isn 't that enough ? No , that 's not enough . I should know . That 's different . You don 't like salsox . She loved salsox ! You hate it . I couldn 't know ... what ? That salsox would succeed ? I like it . Plus it 's natural . Natural ? Then so is the atomic bomb ! Are you jealous ? You gave her the brand as a gift . In exchange for villa i fioretti . Bad move . Very bad . - Forget it . - I can 't , i just can 't ! What 's so great about salsox ? It 's tasteless ! It 's bland ! But complex . Complex ? It 's only ketchup mixed with soy sauce ! There are nuances . Nuances ? That 's a laugh ! Extract of sevillian bull tail . Extract of mexican green tomato . Essence of anti-parkinson green papaya . Concentrate of anti-cancerous chilean seaweed . Anti-diabetic enriched fenugreek . Essence of anti-cholesterol guetaria bonito . Not bad ! Don 't forget the plankton . The enriched boldo . Concentrate of shark 's bone . Enough already ! Harald , be a good sport . I hate her . - She 's dead . - Yes , she 's dead . God wanted it . Your daughter is rich . She 'll save you . - She 's insane . - No . The doctor said no . He 'll say anything . I love livia . I 'm cancelling my dental appointment . Also my osteotherapy and tarot course . Livia is alone . She can 't stay like that . Before there was the dog . I 'll go see her later . Be careful . Don 't drive too fast . Call me as soon as you arrive . Go inside , mother . You 'll catch cold . Keep warm . Yes , i 'll speak to him . No , i think he 's very busy lately . He 's fine . He must have had a last minute problem . Go inside . Mother 's worried . Oh , no ... i 'm on my way . Roast beef . Very rare . I like roast beef . Can i serve you ? Yes . Is it better ? Much better ... 174 . What did i tell you ? Like this ! Some vegetables ? Potatoes , like mlton . Potatoes . I like roast beef . I really do . How 's my roast beef , emil ? Problem ? It won 't start . That car 's too modern . How 's mother ? She waited for you . I called . Her mobile doesn 't work . Too modern . Have a nice day ! Likewise , mister harald . Don 't rush yourselves . My best to the mrs . They don 't seem happy . Because of the widow ? They spoke a lot about the widow . The inheritance , that is . How 's that ? I mean the widow 's inheritance . Mrs salsox . I see . A hefty one ? A few billion . Dollars , that is . Old harald must be happy . He 's not the heir . It 's the daughter of mrs salsox . Still comes to him . Not at all . How do you know ? My wife reads gala . Me , too . Really ? So ? Is it instructive ? Very . What did you learn ? Miss livia is the heiress . And if something happens to her ? Goes to luc . And if something happens to him ? It 's over . Goes to the swiss state . How did mr salsox die ? - You shock me . - Why ? Murdered . - Not here . - No . In Ibiza . Out of our jurisdiction . - And mrs salsox ? - Strangled . - Where ? - New york . - By whom ? - Her lover . - Was he found ? - Yes , murdered . " Mr salsox 's spouse " in 12 letters ? Leone glaser . Leone glaser is 11 letters . Leone glaser h . Something to reflect on . What do you think , ritter ? Excuse me ... The young woman will be killed soon . Tell me , chief ... if the swiss state is the killer ... we can 't arrest the swiss state . That 's like arresting ourselves . What about reason of state ? Possible . But it 's still a crime . No crime yet . We would have noticed . Livia , where are you ? Coming ! You 're so beautiful ! - Do you dance ? - I 'd love to . I have to tell you something . That piece i play on the piano ... that 's all my mother taught me . It 's pretty , but that 's all i know . That 's ok . I like it . Thank you . Leone ! Hello , ma 'am . This is emil . He 's an angel . He kills . Really ? His name is pointpoirot , emil . No accent and no final e . Really ? He has his reasons . He had a tough life . No one was nice to him . Isn 't that right ? That 's right . Come , i 'll show you . So ... you know him . He didn 't suffer ... but him ! Our friend hubus had a heart attack . Little bernadette died in the yard . She ran a lot . Him . Well , he ... that 's a special case . They all left for a wonderful world ... where things are different . Who are you ? Don 't you recognize me ? Your face seems familiar ... but i can 't place you . They 're dead ! I don 't like that . And you ? 132. it 's normal . I 'm normal . Rigor mortis ... no , that 's enough ! That 's not nice ! Stop !

Kill me , i tell you ! Go on ! I 'm speaking to you ! Are you angry ? A little . Put yourself in my place ... you killed , emil . That 's generally not allowed . It 's war , livia . What time is it ? 3 : 30 ? It 's almost over . I must be back at the asylum by 5 . I 'd like to go to the zoo first . The asylum doesn 't take us . Why not ? Because of the monkeys . Why ? They 're so mean ! They 'll pay . For what ? They wanted to kill you , livia . That 's mean . I don 't want to . No way . Who 's " they " ? God . But god couldn 't want that . It happens . - Really ? - Often . He wanted you to die . So did i at first . God is god . But now , no . I say no ! But how ? How do you know he wanted to kill me ? An angel told me . My buddy ... he makes miracles . He opens the asylum doors . So that i can erase . To erase you . No ... that was no angel ! Who was it , then ? It was ... it was the devil . Maybe . He wanted to kill you . He 's mad at you . And you refused ? You 're so good , emil . I refused . I 'm a rebel . May i kiss you ? You may . Drop me in front of the center . I have to see mister harald . You have an appointment ? I don 't need an appointment . I forgot . That bother you ? No . You 're so important ! Big man gets in everywhere . I have degrees . What do you expect ? I worked for that , man . What do you have to say to harald ? Top secret . I 'm looking for files on ud and ufd . I can 't seem to find anything . Tell rosina to call me at the geneva office or in paris . I 'll call you tomorrow from berlin . Thanks . No answer . That 's a good sign . By now , do you think she 's ... normally , yes . My condolences . My god ... i have the papers . What does this mean ? Sign it . Luc should be the heir in case of a problem . God didn 't want that either . My condolences . You 're a monster . The state is a monster . I 'll turn you in ! And take on the state ? Not wise . I 'll do it . No , you 're going to sign . Thank you . Now you have no more debts . The state takes care of it . I should have never ... me neither . But you know the state . You sacrificed yourself , harald . That 's good . That 's honorable . Mister harald ? You there ? Can you hear me ? Something horrible has happened . A real massacre ! Miss ? Don 't do that ! Who 's he ? That 's treffle . He 's good . He always protects me . - Really ? - Yes . I 'm tough sometimes , but only when necessary . Emil , i have to talk to you . Treffle , go in the yard . But , miss ... do as i say . Do what the lady says ! Do as he says . Good ! You need to leave . You 'll be late . It 's already 5 . You 'll miss the zoo . But now i want to stay with you . That 's not possible . Don 't you want me ?

And bless those who prepared it . Amen . Don 't move , warf . What are you doing here ? Protecting little miss . She needs protection . I understand . Actually , no . I don 't understand . He should have shot livia , then luc ... maybe he didn 't have a gun . I gave him one myself . Maybe he threw it out . He never shot anyone before . That 's possible . Now , get out . Can 't we talk about this ? We 're brothers . We have a bond . We have nothing to talk about . She needed to die . She still does . It 's very important . For whom ? For your country . I don 't agree . Someone always doesn 't agree . Get out ! Or i 'll shoot . Think about it ... you 'll be decorated ... your name in the papers . Your future all set up , bro . I don 't agree . I don 't like success . So what do you like ? Tell me and you 'll get it . I like to serve . That 's good , real good ! The highest , purest service of a man ... serve his country ! I like serving the little miss . I 'll give you 10 seconds . Come with us . We 're going for a little ride . It 's not the moment . On the contrary . We have orders . Since when ? This morning . So ? You 're arresting me ? Don 't make me laugh . Laugh ... laugh . That always helps . Especially at a time like this . Wait ... you 're not going to ... ? Alas . You know who i am ? We 'd rather not . We 'd rather not . Come on , don 't worry . It won 't take long . You say you have orders ? Formal . Since this morning ? What were your orders ? " Do nothing . " " Work underhandedly in the shadows . " That 's not clear . It 's very clear .

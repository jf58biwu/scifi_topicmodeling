 My name is Alice . I worked for the Umbrella Corporation , the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world . I was head of security at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive , a giant underground laboratory developing experimental viral weaponry . But there was an incident . The virus escaped and everybody died . Trouble was ... they didn 't stay dead . The T-virus reanimated their bodies . But I survived . Myself and one other , an environmentalist named Matt . When we emerged , we were seized by Umbrella scientists . Matt and I were separated . He 's mutating . I want him in the Nemesis Program . Matt ! Take her to the Raccoon City facility ... and assemble the team . We 're reopening The Hive . I want to know what went on down there . We thought we had survived the horror . But we were wrong . You 're watching Raccoon 7 . And now , the latest weather with Terri Morales . It 's 6 : 10 in the a.m. and already the temperature has reached a massive 92 degrees as this unprecedented heat wave continues . Clear skies in Raccoon City and a light breeze coming in from the west . And as a special bonus just for you , we have a pollen count of 0.7 . And that 's a record low for this time of year . Good news for all you hay fever and asthma sufferers . All in all , it looks like it 's gonna be another beautiful day . Stay with us . After the break , we 're gonna look at some of your favorite holiday hot spots . Advance team , proceed . Sir ? Holy shit ! Excuse us , ma 'am . There 's been an incident . Excuse us , sir . There 's been an incident . How bad is it ? You have to come with us . I have to get my daughter . It 's been taken care of . What are you doing ? Look , you don 't understand . She 's already left for school . This is U-Gamma 7 . Evacuation complete , but we 've just lost contact with Gamma 12 . Unit 12 calling for immediate backup at City Hall . Still no explanation for this wave of unexplained killings that is sweeping across this city . A deadly crime spree with no end . Backup . We need backup now ! Just like Valentine told us . All off-duty law enforcement personnel are required to report for duty assignments immediately . Hey ! Give us a hand over here ! This guy 's insane ! - It 's Valentine . - Hold your fire . Valentine ! They 're infected . Somebody get this ugly bitch off of me ! I told you , shoot for the head . Please , somebody get her ! No , no ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't ... I 'm leaving town . I suggest you do the same . Everyone 's leaving the city . We 've received reports of Umbrella Corporation dispatching armed guards and troop carriers . Move in an orderly fashion to security checkpoints . The city is completely contained , sir . Our troops have sealed all exits . The only way out is across this bridge . All citizens must pass through medical scanning . Sir ! You better take a look at this ! Family members must pass through security checkpoints together . Please proceed in an orderly fashion . Do not run . - He 's clean . Let him pass . - Next ! No pushing , please . Keep in line . Can we get some reinforcements down here ? Chopper Delta , new orders . Proceed directly to Ravens Gate Bridge . Reinforcements urgently needed . Copy that , base . On our way . Ohh ! Get it . No ! No ! Get off ! Get away ! No ! Stop ! Stop ! Get off ! No ! No ! Get away ! No ! Get back ! Civilian in trouble . Three o 'clock . Take us down . I can 't . We have our orders . No ! Get back ! No ! No ! They 're gonna kill her ! Take us down ! She is a civilian . We have our orders . Fuck orders . Nicholai , tie me off . Get back ! No ! Wait ! Wait ! Now ! Take us down . Down now ! Hey ! Hey , you okay ? Step away from the edge . Come over to me . Everything 's okay . No , it 's not . I 've seen what happens to you once you 've been bitten . We can help you . There 's no going back . No ! Move ! Peyton ! Peyton ! Valentine ! Hey ! Hey , Valentine ! Move ! Police . Move ! Hey , let her through . Hey . Glad you 're here . We could use the help . He has a weak heart . Get away from him ! Everybody stand back . Ohh ! Ugh ! Daddy ! Get away ! Get her away from him ! It 's okay . Come on , I got you . Get her away ! Daddy ! It 's okay . I got you . Aarrgghhh ! Get him off me ! Get him off me ! Move aside ! Get back ! It 's here . It 's reached the gate . Why are you still here ? You should have got out while you had the chance . These are our people , Jill . Close them . Sir ? Seal the gates . Our men are still out there- - Just do it . My God ! Oh , my God , they 're closing the gates ! Come on ! This is a biohazard quarantine area . Due to risk of infection , you cannot be allowed to leave the city . What the fuck is going on here ? All appropriate measures are being taken . The situation is under control . Please return to your homes . You won 't get away with this ! You have five seconds to turn around and return to the city . Do it . Use of live ammunition has been authorized . Five . They can 't shoot people ! Four . They won 't fire . Three . Two . Get them back ! Move ! One . Clear out ! Everybody , clear out . Kilo and Romeo squads rendezvous at sector 01 and secure against enemy . Grenade ! Grenade ! Squads three to seven are in full retreat . No , sir . Suppression measures have failed . We can 't contain it . The infection is spreading faster than anyone could have anticipated . Dr. Ashford . Shouldn 't you be on the chopper ? I 'm not going . I was instructed to get you and the other scientists out of the hot zone . You 're too important to Umbrella to be put at risk . I 'm not leaving without my daughter . I 'm sorry , truly , but the city is sealed . She may have survived the crash , but we couldn 't find her anywhere . Even if she was still alive , I couldn 't let her out , not now . The risk of infection is too great . You must understand . You do what you have to do . I 'm staying . There has to be someone left alive . Come on . Matt ! Take her to the Raccoon City facility . I want her quarantined . Close observation . Prepare for exposure . Up the dosage . Just do it . Inside . Let 's get under cover . You have to get out ! This is my place . I 'm hiding here . It 's big enough for all of us . Don 't tell me what- - Okay , just cool it . Put the gun down . Put the gun down . And , you , take it easy . So does the Raccoon City Police Department have any comment on what those things are ? What 's that you got there ? My ... Emmy . That 's if any of us make it out of here . Are you all right ? What are you doing ? What 's wrong ? It 's my sister . She 's not well . Maybe I can help . No . Out of my way ! Just get out ! You 're feeding her ? You 're sick . Just leave us alone . No ! I 'm getting out of here . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , no ! Hey , help us ! Help ! Get it in there ! Get it in there ! What the hell was that ? There ! Jesus ! What the fuck is that thing ? Hey , what are you doing ? Get back here ! Peyton . Terri . Peyton ! Shhh ! I know . I count three of them . They got us boxed in . What are we gonna do ? Let 's go ! Oh ! Jesus ! We 're gonna need more ammo . I 'm out . Shit ! I 'm out . Move ! Who the fuck are you ? GTA , motherfucker ! Arggh ! Oh ! Yeah ! Ten points ! Yuri , you okay ? Uh-huh . Bite this ! Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . Pull back ! Pull back ! This way . This is Olivera . We 've been overrun . Request immediate chopper evac . We need to find somewhere to stop for a moment . Uh-uh . I don 't think that 's a good idea . There might be more of those ... things . If there were more , we 'd have seen them by now . So you know what they are ? They 're bio-weapons from the Umbrella labs beneath the city . How come you know so much about Umbrella ? I used to work for them . Oh ! Damn it ! Hold it . What do you think you 're doing ? He 's wounded . The infection 's spreading . I 'm fine . You should take care of him now . It 'll be more difficult later . You know that . No . If it comes to that , I 'll take care of it myself . As you wish . It 's nothing personal . But in an hour , maybe two , you 'll be dead . And moments later , you 'll become one of them . You 'll endanger your friends , try to kill them , probably succeed . I 'm sorry . That 's just the way it is . Help me ! There 's too many of them . Let 's get out of here . This way . Sir , T-virus infection has reached critical levels . This presents a perfect opportunity . Ensure all data streams are recorded . Activate Nemesis Program now . Hey ! Here ! Here ! We 're down here ! Come ! Come ! We 're here ! Where are they going ? They 're landing over there . Let 's get Yuri . Come on ! Come on , Yuri , we 're getting out of here . We 'll get you fixed up . Come . Hold on , Yuri . We 're almost there . No . No ! Don 't leave ! No , we 're down here ! We 're coming ! They dropped something in the hospital . Did you see it ? Maybe a radio . One that works . Take Yuri . Hold on . Hold on , Yuri . Nicholai , put me down . Okay . Rest here . What is this ? Looks like weapon cases . We don 't need weapons . We need evacuation ! These weren 't meant for us . Yuri ! Plenty to go around . Whoo-hoo ! Don 't shoot ! I got the power . Thank you . I owe you one , man . Shit ! Maybe I was safer outside . Get them guns out of my damn face . Motherfucker , please . Look . My shit is custom . Shh ! What the fuck 's that ? Shhhhhit ! You 're going down , you son of a bitch ! Fuck ! Deploy defensive formation . Take him down . You motherfuckers is crazy . Look at that big motherfucker , got a rocket launcher ! What do we have ? A dozen armed men . Well organized . I 'm surprised there 's anyone left alive . They 're S.T.A.R.S. Special Tactics and Rescue Squad . They 're the best . Fire ! Back ! Fall back ! Let 's see how good they really are . Altering protocols . S.T.A.R.S. Oh , shit . Respect . Those were some pretty slick moves back there . I 'm good ... but I 'm not that good . You should be thankful for that . What do you mean ? They did something to me . I barely feel human anymore . We should keep moving , before the sound attracts anything . Keep moving . Hello ? God , I thought you 'd never answer . Who is this ? I can get you out of the city . All four of you . But first we have to come to an arrangement . Are you ready to make a deal ? Do we have a choice ? Not if you want to live beyond tonight , no . So his name is Dr. Ashford , and he runs- - Runs the advanced genetics and viral research division of the Umbrella Corporation . What 's he want with us ? His daughter , Angela , is trapped within the city . Umbrella was supposed to evac her , but she didn 't make it . She 's hiding out in her school . We find her , he 'll help us escape the perimeter . No fucking deal . We find the building with the thickest walls and strongest doors and we barricade ourselves in , sit tight , wait for help . There won 't be any help . According to Ashford , Umbrella know they can 't contain the infection . So at sunrise this morning , Raccoon City will be completely sanitized . What do you mean by " sanitized " ? A precision tactical nuclear device . What yield ? Five kilotons . Fuck me . Stupid ... What does that mean ? It means that it 'll destroy the infection and all evidence of it . It 's bullshit . It 's bullshit ! No fucking way would they get away with that ! It would be all over the fucking news ! Cover-up . Cover-up is already prepared . A meltdown at the nuclear power plant . A tragic accident . Not even Umbrella 's capable of this . Not capable ? Peyton , you were there at the bridge . You know exactly how far Umbrella will go . So , what do we do now ? Huh ? I think we should be out of here by sunrise . What if there is no way out of the city and he 's watching us on these cameras like this is some kind of sick game ? What is it ? What 's going on ? Wait . The sunrise ain 't gonna wait . No . There 's something down there . Where ? There . I don 't see anything . Well , that doesn 't alter the fact that there is ... something down there . I 'm getting sick of this bullshit ! Peyton ! No ! He 's located another two S.T.A.R.S. members . Nemesis . Run . Just go ! Primary target is identified . Gentlemen , this is what we 've been waiting for . Confirm at 2 : 18 and 27 seconds . The Nemesis Program is now fully activated . Look , I 'm- - I 'm sorry about your friend . Let 's just get to the school and find this kid . Peyton ! Peyton ! Huh . This bite , it won 't stop bleeding . Why didn 't they see us ? What ? The chopper . We were right there in the street in front of the hospital . How could they not see us ? They saw us . What do you mean ? We 're assets , Nicholai . Expendable assets . And we 've just been expended . Stop ! I 'm not one of those things ! Hey ! Remember me ? Look , I haven 't been bitten or anything . Look . Climb aboard . Lloyd Jefferson Wade . You can call me L.J. on account of the informal situation . We 're gonna have to split up to search this place . Forget it . Forget it . I 'm not going out there by myself ! I can go with you . You , take the first floor . You , take the second . I 'll take the basement . I 've never shot a gun before . There 's nothing to it . Try to hit them in the head . I see you , mother- - Oh , shit ! So did you get the call as well ? What ? You 're here for the girl ? Oh , yeah , yeah . The girl . Dr. Ashford didn 't say he made a deal with someone else . I guess we 're partners . Shit . Angela ? It 's gonna be okay . There 's no need to be afraid . We 're gonna take you home . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . God ! Help me ! Help ! Terri ? You can 't help her . Not now . I 've seen what they do . Are you Angela ? Yes . We should hurry before they come back . Hold this . Angela Ashford , huh ? That 's a pretty grown-up name for a little girl . I 'm not a little girl . Besides ... all my friends call me Angie . Angie , huh ? I like that . Those things are in here . It 's okay , honey , they 're slow . We can run around them . No , not them . Them . Get back . Stay . Thought you might need a hand . You work for Umbrella ? Used to . Till they left us for dead in this place . Now I consider myself freelance . Sergeant Nicholai Genovev , at your service . Come on ! Wait ! Angie ! Save the girl ! I 've got this bitch . Oh , shit . From now on , stay right beside me . It 's blocked . What do we do now ? Wait here . Eyes ... Okay ? Thank you . You two know each other ? She 's infected . She 's infected on a massive level . How can you know that ? Because she is too . You 're infected ? When were you gonna tell us that ? Let me see . No . You know I 'm not gonna hurt you . Let me see . It 's the antivirus , the cure to the T-virus . There 's a cure ? How did you get this ? My daddy . My daddy made it for me . He 's sick . And someday , I 'll get sick too . He just wanted to stop that . When I was little ... I had to walk on crutches . They said I 'd never get better , just worse . He found a way to make me stronger . The T-virus . Then they took the invention away from him . Get out of my house ! He 's not a bad man . He didn 't mean for any of this . It 's okay . Don 't shoot , don 't shoot . He 's cool . He made a deal with Dr. Doom , same as you . How many of you guys are there ? What do you mean ? Nicholai . When were you bitten ? Three hours ago . What the- - ? It 's your lucky day . You should have told me you got bit , motherfucker . I 'm hanging with you and shit . Let me speak to my daughter . First , you tell us how we 're getting out . There 's a helicopter already being prepped . It takes off in 47 minutes . It 'll be the last transport to leave Raccoon City before they detonate the missile . I take it this helicopter isn 't laid out especially for us . No . It has another purpose , but it 'll be lightly guarded . Where is the evac site ? May I speak to my daughter now ? Daddy ? Hey , sweetheart . Are you all right ? When can I see you ? Soon . These people will bring you to see me . I 'll see you very soon . Put the lady back on . Where do we have to go ? The helicopter will be at City Hall . I suggest you make haste . Computers . So unreliable . Just like people . You really thought I didn 't know ? So , what are you injecting me with ? The antivirus . The T-virus reanimates dead cells . Basically , bringing the dead to life . Or in a living human , it can cause uncontrollable mutation . Or it can help her walk again , if the virus is kept in check with this . Angie 's infected ? Yes . The cellular growth is enough to regenerate her , but not enough to cause further mutation . And they infected you with the T-virus as well ? Yeah . But don 't worry , I 'm not contagious . Here . Tape the story . I 'll see that it gets put to good use . My name is Alice . I worked for the Umbrella Corporation , the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world . I was head of security at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive , a giant underground laboratory developing experimental viral weaponry . Let 's go . Hey ! You missed one . We have to hurry . We 're okay . We have time . No ! We have to hurry . Holy shit ! We stealing his ride . Take off . I said take off ! What 's the rush ? We 've been expecting you . Perimeter secure . All sectors locked down . Angie ! Daddy . Hey . I knew you wouldn 't leave me . No , no , never , never . Discard primary weaponry . The two of you showed such promise , but we had to see you in action . And most impressive you 've been . You 're like brother and sister . Heightened speed , strength , agility , the same killer instincts . Parallel strands of research . And now ... Now we discover which is superior . Fight him . No . Fight him or they die . What makes you think I care ? Daddy ! Daddy , no ! Son of a- - No ! He was a valuable asset to the corporation . I don 't even care about these people . Begin . He 's mutating . I want him in the Nemesis Program . Matt ! Cellular structure breaking down . T-virus is manifesting itself in a genetic mutation . We 're seeing similar cellular regeneration . I 'm sorry . Oh , Matt , I 'm- - I 'm so sorry . Finish him . I said , finish him . No . No . Don 't you understand how important you are to me ? That creature is one thing , but you ... Somehow you bonded with the T-virus on a cellular level . You adapted it , changed it . You became ... magnificent . I became a freak . No , you 're not mutation . You 're evolution . With my help , just imagine what you can achieve . What about him ? Evolution has its dead ends . Now , finish this . Put him out of his misery . And come with me . No . You 're such a disappointment to me . All that strength , but no will to use it . What a waste . Prepare for takeoff . Sanitation of Raccoon City to commence on my mark . Kill her . What are you doing ? Get us airborne . This is Cain . Priority overload . Initiate launch proceedings . Detonation set at T-minus 5 minutes . Angie , get down ! Why haven 't we taken off ? Because I usually drive a Cadillac . Surrender , or we open fire . Drop it . Alice ! Drop your weapon and surrender . Let 's get this thing in the air ! You have to get up . Matt ... Come on , we have to go . We have to go , come on . Come on . Get up ! If you expect me to beg , I will not . Wait ! Killing me won 't put things right . No ! But it 's a start . Ah ! Are you going to be all right ? Hang on to something ! We 're going down ! U-Gamma 9 to base . Confirmation . We 've located the crash site . Fetch the medical team . What about the others ? No other bodies found , sir . We have unconfirmed reports of disaster at Raccoon City . These shocking images just in . A mysterious plague or viral outbreak seems to have run rampant- - ... implicating the Umbrella Corporation in the death of innocent citizens . This tape , apparently the work of former Raccoon 7 anchorwoman Terri Morales . New evidence now , which discreditsearlier reports- - This is nothing more than a sick joke . Fake videotape now totally discredited . Nothing more than an elaborate hoax . Playing on the very real tragedy which overwhelmed Raccoon City earlier this week . Apparently , the reactor at the nuclear power station went critical in the early hours . Making this the worst atomic energy disaster since the Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986 . The state governor has personally extended his thanks to the Umbrella Corporation for their swift actions . The perpetrators of the hoax , Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera , now being sought for questioning by the police . Alice . Alice . Alice . Wake up . Can you hear me ? Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Good . Begin the purging process . Her recovery 's remarkable . And her powers , both physical and mental , are developing at a geometric rate . Wh- - Wh- - Wh- - Where are you ? Where ? You 're safe . Come on . That 's it . There we are . Do you know what that is ? It 's a pen . See ? You try . That 's it . P- - Pen . P- - Look at me . Can you remember anything ? Hmm ? You remember your name ? My name ? My name ... I want her under 24-hour observation . I want a complete set of blood work , chemical and electrolyte analysis by the end of the day . My name ... My name ... Sir ? Advanced reflex testing is also a priority . My name ... I want her electrical impulses monitored and her- - Sir ? Sir ! What is it ? My name ... is Alice . And I remember everything . Oh ! Uggh ! This is central . Request immediate backup . Maximum response . Ahh ! Thank you , gentlemen . We 'll take over from here . On whose authority ? Classified . Level six authorization . Sorry , sir . Let them go . Good to have you back . Are you all right ? Program Alice activated .

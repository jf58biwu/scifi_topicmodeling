 Previously on Farscape . You will never get the wormhole tech from me . I merely want to safeguard it , and hope that when the inevitable Scarran bloodbath begins , you make the appropriate choices . Oh , so you 're here to be John 's protector . Crichton : Scorpius is here , looking for the key to what is inside my head . He will use you and the baby and I will not be able to stop him . D 'Argo , Rygel and Scorpius are boarding Lo 'La . I gotta go . I gotta go look after Scorpius . We should do it together . No , you know we can 't do that together . Besides , you gotta look after the girls . That 's not fun . It 's more fun than mental arts training camp . Scorpius : Grayza does not want Earth . Grayza wants you . Why do I always attract the psychos ? Grayza : Braca , prepare the Marauders . Set course for our meeting with the Scarrans . Yes , ma 'am . What shall I do ? Stall her , Braca . I 'm not given to exaggeration , but the future of Peacekeeper survival depends on you . And now , on Farscape . D 'Argo : Rygel , what is wrong with you ? I don 't think I 've ever seen you not eat for so long . I 'm learning self-discipline that Katoya taught me . Besides , none of you can cook . Well you could cook for yourself . I really should cook something for the girls . They 're due back . They 'll be hungry when they get here . They are overdue , I believe . Chiana : You brought us to a dead Leviathan ? Sikozu : The carcass has been fused to this planetoid to house a commerce settlement . Aeryn : It 's an unimpressive settlement . I doubt we 'll find what we 're looking for . If we want to camouflage Moya against long-range scans , this is the place . Chiana : Well , it doesn 't look like it . Well , if you were selling outlawed mods , would you want everyone knowing about it ? See these humble stores ? They also sell genetic transformations , species blending , and all the appropriate documents to go with it . ( spitting ) 100 % natural , my tul-lum . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . This way , come on . Hey , hey , hey . We want to speak to Rekka . Sure you 've stumbled onto the right ... dead Leviathan ? I know you are his negotiator . And I also know you make your deals in this pile of dren . Perhaps you 'd like a private table . First round on the house . Care to hear our specials ? Sikozu : Not unless you have a discount on sensor distorters . Sensual consorters ? Is that some sort of pleasure toy ? ( chuckling ) Look , I know you have to check us out . That 's your job . That 's fine . But now that you know that I know what I 'm talking about , I suggest you start taking us seriously . I 'd love to take you . Seriously . ( sighs ) ( chuckling ) Won 't your grandmother object ? Don 't drink them . They 're drugged . Sikozu : A suggestibility potion , perhaps ? Such an old trick . My apologies to you . And professional admiration for your skills . Sikozu : Thank you . May we see Rekka now ? Tell me what you need . What do you want ? Sikozu : We need a sensor distorter for our ship , to fool long-range scans . And what do you want to look like ? An ore freighter . Chiana : A fast pleasure yacht with a jacuzzi . Aeryn : What about several choices of energy signatures ? ( snaps fingers ) Well I 'll need to check your sensor modulator . Do you ladies know what that looks like ? Chiana : Gee ... I guess we do . That 's partly organic . Leviathan . Very good . Distorter will only fool a warship if your movements exactly match your new identity . Is your Pilot that good ? Yes . - No . ( weak chuckle ) Your problem , not mine . Leviathans need custom builds . I 'm going to have to take your modulator . That 'll leave Moya half-blind . It 'll take four arns . - Four ? And 19,000 crinders . - What ? ! And we 'll give you some complimentary tokens to the facilities of your choice . How about ... I offer you some complimentary choices ? Would that lower your price ? 30,000 . ( chuckling ) And if it 's that , 40,000 . Be nice . 16,000 . Half up front . Meet us at your Pod . Do you know where it is ? Yes , we know where it is . Be there in four arns . That 's too long . Our deal , our rules . Take these tokens and enjoy yourselves in the meantime . Chiana : Do we trust them ? Sikozu : Of course not . What do we do ? Just keep an eye on them , Chi . 16,000 crinders . Not bad . Not bad at all . Now what ? Wait a minute . Where 's Noranti ? Oh , frell . Get down . There 's Peacekeepers . What ? How many ? Grayza , Braca , four SSDs . No , they could not have followed us here . That is impossible . Unless someone tipped them . You are sure they 're coming , ma 'am ? Of course I 'm sure . Keep searching . Keep searching . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Chiana ? Chiana , can you hear me ? ( static ) Why are the Comms frelled ? Sikozu : Peacekeepers must 've jammed them , Aeryn . We need to stick together . Aeryn : One weapon I have . Six of them . Sikozu : And two outlaws who are on the same side . Noranti , there are six Peacekeepers . Grayza , Braca , four SSD commandos . Can you find Chiana ? Can you warn her ? We 've got four long arns to stay low . Yes , yes , of course . As I see it we have several choices . We can follow Grayza , find out what she 's up to , or we can stay out of sight . Say . May I serve you ? - Yeah . I 'm just looking for two gentleman that just came through here . One 's tall , dark hair . The other one 's , um , bald on top , shorter , hair out sideways . I haven 't seen anyone of that description . Are you , uh , quite sure ? Mm-hmm . What 's in there ? Services . Expensive services . Well , I don 't mind expensive services . As long as they 're worth paying for . ( rumbling ) Do you hear that ? - Certainly do . Unusual sonic pattern . - Double-winged . Sounds like a Stryker . - I agree . Fastest ship in the Scarran fleet . But what the frell is it doing here ? And Grayza seems to recognize it , too . ( whispering ) : ... information . Yes . What are you gonna do now ? Nebari nu anits . What 's that ? We begin the manipulation here . Ooh ... You carry a lot of tension in your skrillum . Oh , yeah . Tell me about it . Ooh ... How does this feel ? Yeah , yeah , dig deeper . Deeper , yeah . How 's this ? That s drad . Hey , uh , the reason why I 'm ... I 'm really tense is because I 've been following these ... these two Sebacean males and I , uh , I think they came in here . And I-I was wondering if you could help me out . ( groaning ) ( grunts ) I can 't move . Well , pinch of pressure on the milla-nerve paralyzes Nebari from the neck down . Permanently ? That depends . Look ... I 'm just a runaway Nebari . A crook , just like everybody else . Just ... ask ... ask Rekka . Rekka ? Ah , frell . You know , I-I-I forgot to tell him something , and ... and it would be really great if you could help me out . You have any idea what else we sell here ? Yeah . Genetic modification . Shape changes . That 's right . And whoever buys a transformation kit also buys confidentiality . So he 's probably just walked straight by me . Gizah ! A Scarran . Nah-ka set-at koth sekan devock ! Di-fan vivock ! Scarran delegation . One 's a member of the Ruling Caste . Four Charrid escorts . One commander , one adjutant , four warriors . Same as the other side . - Which implies a meeting . Why ? Why would she meet with them ? - Grayza clearly isn 't interested in us . So if we go and get the modulator , this provides a perfect opportunity for us to leave ... No , no , no , no , no . This is a perfect opportunity for us to stay . Otherwise , we learn nothing . Does this look like an official conference to you ? On a remote planet with no Scarran proconsul ? No . Exactly . She 's most likely exceeding her authority . If we could somehow make Peacekeeper High Command privy to that ... . They will relieve her of her duty . We get her off our backs . There 's an awful lot of " if 's , " Aeryn . Have we been in a more fortuitous position to try than now ? How could I possibly serve you ? I 'm looking for a Nebari girl . This high , kind of grey ... Marella ! Marella : Another one ? Noranti : Ah , there she is . Psst ! We have to go find the Pod now and go to the modulator , because there are visitors here that we 'd rather not run into . Are you frelled ? - We 're all frelled . Grayza and Braca are here with four SSD commandos . Grayza and Braca ? Oh , you 've seen them , too . Chiana : No , no , no . Aeryn ? ( static ) Can you hear me ? Oh , no , no , no , no . She can 't . What 's with the Comms ? They 're pranged . Peacekeepers . Jamming . Oh come on , we 've gotta go . Peacekeepers . Commando : A Nebari female ... Commandos . ... report immediately to a Peacekeeper . Transform us . Full genetic modification . Good enough to , uh , to pass DNA scan . But you have to select a species before we can ... Well , we 're not really that choosy . - No , no , not , not , not ... Maybe ... maybe big loomas . Noranti : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Eyes ? Eyes would be great . - Oh , eyes ! Oh , you choose . - Yes , you choose . Nothing too special . Well , I 'll do this one , you service her . Come on . ( sniffing ) Braca : The site is secure . You won 't mind if we confirm that for ourselves ? If you feel it necessary . My troops are continuing to patrol the area . How reassuring . ( sniffs ) Aeryn : We 're too far away . Sikozu : This magnifies sound as well as image . Tell me what 's happening , or I 'll take over . Commandant Grayza . Minister Ahkna . That is War Minister Ahkna . Third in rank in the Scarran fleet . Wow . You 've abided by the terms of this meeting ? Exactly as we agreed . You 'll have to take my word for it . You 've been conditioned to resist Scarran mind probing . We all have . Oh , my ... What ? - Shh . Will you take my word on that , or will you waste more time testing us ? I dislike wasting time . Why are you here ? As I communicated . I want peace . Everyone wants peace . But what price will you pay to achieve it ? What if I were to offer you ... the Luxan territories ? Frell . Will you tell me ? Grayza says she 's willing to cede all the Luxan worlds to the Scarrans in exchange for peace . What ? She can 't mean it . The Peacekeepers and Luxans have a mutual defense pact . Grayza has to be bluffing . She can 't fulfill that promise . The Luxans would go to war . And how long could the Luxans hold out against the Scarrans without the support of the Peacekeepers ? If that really is Grayza 's intention we can 't let her go through with it . I doubt we could talk her out of it , Aeryn . I wasn 't thinking about talking . I have a gun . You would assassinate Grayza ? She 'd do the same to us . All right . Then what ? Do you have any plan of escape ? Run . Anything more detailed , Aeryn ? Run quickly . And what if we run into more opposition than we can handle ? You have the conversation with D 'Argo about why his worlds were obliterated . Grayza : In return for dominion over the Luxan territories , the Scarrans will relinquish all claims to the disputed sectors of the Uncharted Territories . Disputed sectors being ... Everywhere beyond the Kellek Nebula . Hardly an equitable exchange . More than equitable . The Luxan worlds are wealthy . There 's little of value in the Uncharted Territories . So , why would you make such an exchange ? Especially now . The Luxans are your allies . High Command already regrets that decision . Luxans are warriors , not diplomats . They are a liability to our peace efforts . So ... you would just abandon them ? Yes . For the greater good . We are also aware of how long you have coveted their resources . In the same way you 've coveted the expansion room the Uncharted Territories would give you . Each party gains advantages and a costly war is averted . You would never get your Council to support such a treaty . A majority of the counselors already support me . They are ready for a change of leadership . You ... would seize power ? For the greater good . The beneficial effects of this treaty will also , of course , speed your ascent through the Scarran Hierarchy . I need no help in that regard . Ah . How many cycles ago was your father deposed ? How long since your last promotion ? Too long . But then , I don 't resort to the methods you utilize to advance . Would you have a weapon in your armory and leave it unused , out of squeamish good taste ? Commando : Captain Braca . It 's all right . Yes ? We have word of a Nebari female somewhere in the settlement . Description matches the escapee Chiana . Braca : Stay here . I 'll check it out . You . Nebari female . You look fine . - I look hideous . No wisdom creases , no memory lines . My eye ! - Whoa . Noranti : Look , I 've earned all these things and I ... Shut your wacket hole . Let me do the talking , okay ? Okay . We 're looking for a female Nebari . You . You . We 're looking for a Nebari . Female . ( in a deep sultry voice ) Well , then try Sooret 's . Level three . Any kind of ... of female you could care for . Right . Hands off . I 'm not on the market . Besides , I don 't even like men . What are you doing ? - DNA scan . ( Chiana grunts ) - Be quiet . Oh , quiet ? Quiet , my eema . - No match . Just because you 've got a fancy uniform ... - Old woman . ... does that make you important ? - Ooh . What is that ? What is that ? - Drugs ? Ooh ! I don 't need drugs . I 've got true love . You don 't need drugs if you 've got true love . You . Have you seen a Nebari female ? Well , I wouldn 't know one if it bit me on the prang . Though that could be fun . Gray girl . Thin . Young . Good looking ? - Mmm . We only ever notice the good looking ones . I said I would do the talking . Well , you didn 't say all the talking . I thought we did rather well . ( gasping ) Come on . We 've gotta get back to Aeryn before the treatment wears off . Sikozu : They 're still arguing about how to carve up the Uncharted Territories . But you still believe that Ahkna wants the deal to go ahead ? Yes , I do . Grayza : So you would approve a division point at the Lanthal system . Ahkna : In principle , yes . Then it would seem we have an agreement . Ahkna : First , let 's talk about disarmament . I 'm not prepared to discuss that . At present , I 'll deal only with territory , not weapons . Unsatisfactory . You claim you have military superiority . We do more than claim ! Yet you will not even talk about arms reduction . We are prepared to coexist in peace , but not to make ourselves vulnerable . There are some in our hierarchy who believe you are already vulnerable . That your claims to military superiority are exaggerated . Perhaps the loss of our Dreadnought was only an experiment , that you haven 't been able to repeat or , perhaps it wasn 't you who did it . If this is so , why should we settle for peace ? Because you would lose a war . Ahkna 's suspicious . She thinks the Peacekeepers might be lying about having wormhole weapons . The fear of wormhole weapons is the only thing stopping Scarrans from invading Peacekeeper space . Without them thinking they 've got those weapons everyone 's frelled . ( sighs ) Grayza is making out a document . Ahkna is looking it over . Okay . It 's time to intervene . Commando : Maintain intruder alert . Wait . - Full search pattern . The treaty appears satisfactory . It is . Your captain should bear witness . There is no need to wait for him , if you 're ready . Pennoch . Bear witness . ( grunting ) ( gasping ) ( snapping ) ( short beep ) ( short beep ) ( weapon charging ) It 's too late . They 've already signed . Kill her anyway . They will never enforce a treaty if she 's dead . I can 't get a shot . There was no Nebari , ma 'am . No matter , Captain Braca . This ... was an historic day . Congratulations . Pennoch . ( growls ) ( gunfire ) ( gasping ) Ahkna , you are a fool . This is an act of war . I assure you , Commandant , you won 't be missed . Grayza : You would not dare murder me . We merely want to speak in much more detailed terms about your wormhole capabilities . You already know that you 'll learn nothing . No , not here . But our facilities are so much better on Katratzi . ( Pennoch snarls ) They 'll interrogate her now . What happens when they learn the truth about wormhole weapons ? They won 't . We can 't let them . Sikozu ? - Shh . Frell . Go . What the frell happened to you two ? We needed a camouflage to fool the DNA scans . - It isn 't permanent . Have you got the modulator ? - Not yet . What are Scarrans doing here ? - Doesn 't matter . Whatever it takes , get the modulator and meet us at the Pod . Right . Go . Right , we 're low on weapons . Well , I didn 't bring any guns . I don 't have any guns . What can you do ? What can you make ? Fyang powder . It 's a wonderful substance . It 'll put anyone to sleep instantly . - Good . Except I don 't have any . - Not good . However , this looks like mayla spores . They 're very powerful . Scarrans , Charrids . Will it work on them ? I 've never tried on either . Ahkna , this blunder will cost you dearly . Hmm . The blunder was yours , Commandant . Braca : You 've just guaranteed yourselves a war you cannot win . Our wormhole technology will decimate your planet . ( gasping ) Pennoch : You terrify me . Do we need this one ? Yes , we do . When he no longer has a use , may I be the one to dispose of him ? Yes , you may . Let us prepare the Stryker and summon the Dreadnought to the rendezvous point . We won 't be long . ( grunting ) How are you going , Noranti ? Preparing mayla spores takes time . ( spits ) And spit . We never have enough time . I don 't have enough spit . But I 'm doing what I can . All right . They took Grayza and Braca into Bay Nine but their Stryker 's still powered down . So , we have enough time to ... - No . Two Charrids came back out . They 're heading this way now . - Two ? Charrid : You heard Ahkna 's orders . If you see a Peacekeeper Commando shoot to kill . Identify yourself . - Don 't shoot . I know who you are . ( whispering ) : What are you doing ? And I know who you 're looking for . You don 't have to harm me . I can show you where to find the ones you 're seeking . Tell me where they are . Just a microt . My nose . I ... I ... need ... I need a ... ( sneezes ) Aah ! - Just a sneeze . I 'm sorry . I said I could help to find the ones you seek , and I will show you . Right now , there 's one behind you . Right there . A Peacekeeper . ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( gasps ) ( sizzling ) Yeah . I must remember to get more mayla spores . Yes . That was good . Thank you . Now , I know it 's not your color , but ... Sikozu : It 'll get us into Bay Nine . Noranti : Oh , please , let me go . I 'm not a Peacekeeper . I don 't even know any Peacekeepers . You 've got the wrong young female . ( panting ) Oh , please , please . I 'm being attacked by one ... by two ... of you . Aeryn : Hey , gorgeous . ( grunting ) Hello . Sikozu : That leaves us one Charrid , two Scarrans ... Aeryn : And two Peacekeepers , Commandant . ( engines powering up ) Frell . ( groans ) Grayza : Aeryn Sun . Exceptional work . And congratulations on your Luxan treaty . For that alone I shall kill you both . Aeryn ... Grayza : Alive , I can repudiate that treaty . But you proposed it , and you signed it . And if the Scarrans had not betrayed me , I 'd have stood by it . We could have lived in peace . Without me , how are you planning to get past the Command Carrier that 's orbiting this dead Leviathan ? If I 'm not back at the Pod in half an arn , you go without me . What ? ! - Go . I 'll cover . - Move . ( grunts ) ( growling ) Sikozu : Into ... into the cafe . Into the cafe ! No . The Pod is that way . No , Noranti , we 're going to wait here for Aeryn . Aeryn is dead by now . - I said keep moving ... - She 's right . ... to the back . Killing Charrids is one thing , but two Scarrans ? I said , shut up ! It was a great sacrifice on her part . It isn 't over . She will survive . Alone ? She 's got no chance . Maybe you should go and help her and I 'll take these two to the Pod . No , Noranti . We have one weapon . The Scarrans will be here any microt . This area is undefendable . Might I suggest ... - Shut up ! If we stay , we die . It would be a great pity if Aeryn 's death were for nothing . She 's not dead . ( grunting ) This way . - Find the Marauder . We must leave immediately . Why did you do that ? We don 't like trespassers . This is my Pod , okay ? I got transformed . Look . Look at me . It 's me . ( laughing ) Uh , seriously now , we do have a strict policy . Nobody steals our client 's ships . ( startled gasps ) Noranti . Noranti . You right ? Up you get . ( grunts ) I swear to you , I 've been genetically transformed to fool the Peacekeepers . You gave me the frelling tokens . It 's her . Are you sure ? They didn 't transform her tongue . In that case , here 's your modulator , with the sensor distorter installed . You do still want this ? Plug it into the Nee-la trunk . Your Pilot will feel his options . Hey . Do I get a discount for being knocked out ? ( laughs ) We should charge you more for guarding your Pod . ( snarling ) - What 's going on ? Thanks for your patronage . Are you all right ? Yeah . Let 's get this Pod started . Shouldn 't we wait for Aeryn ? We 'll wait half an arn , like she said . So where is she ? You all right ? Where are the Scarrans ? What if they get here first ? If the Scarrans get here first , then we leave immediately . Because Aeryn is as good as dead . It 's almost time . No . We need to find Aeryn . Wait , Chiana , please . For once in your life , exercise some self-control . I am exercising self-control . I 'm not blasting off your head . Stop , stop . She 's coming . Oh , thank jung . - Are you all right ? Yes , I 'm fine . All right . Sit down and hold on . Pilot , any word ? - Yes , Ka D 'Argo . As you speak , a Transport Pod is approaching at high speed . Have they signaled distress ? - No . Have we signaled Rygel 's distress ? Inadvisable , as that would confirm our position to the Scarran warship pursuing them . Pilot , Starburst as soon as they 're aboard . I am already preparing , Captain . Stand by for Starburst . Now . ( sniffing ) Do you really need to do that ? Remarkable . Well , changing my genetics changes my scent . Is it permanent ? Do you want it to be ? I prefer the elegant gray . Rygel : You paid too much . Ah . You don 't even know if I paid . It was still too much . I 'll reimburse you double if you can cook for me . I may never cook again . Noranti , please ! Crichton : It 's not your fault . We had her . We let her go . Well , you 're here , she 's not . I 'll take that trade . She tried to strike a deal . Ahkna wouldn 't go for it . The Scarrans must be dead set on war . That s Scorpy s line . Let someone else lose sleep over it tonight . What should we lose sleep over ? Careful . ( roaring jolt ) Everyone , despite our Starburst , the Scarran warship is still in pursuit , at the extreme edge of Moya 's senses . How did they find us so fast ? Try a homing beaon . Pilot . I 'm not detecting any signals . John 's right . Must be a beacon . Chiana . Nope , nothing in the Pod . Still looking . I am certain the sensor distorter contains no transmitter or homing beacon , of any sort . All right , it 's not the hardware . Try the software . Pilot ? Adjusting now . Anything from that planet . Anything . You know , it could be her . We were separated . I did not betray you . What ? You want me to undress ? The DRDs detect nothing from either Sikozu , Chiana or Noranti . Nothing from Aeryn either . Scorpius : A tier-by-tier search of this vessel would be the unavoidable next step . Pilot : There 's no time for that . The Scarran warship is now on the on the edge of Moya 's sense horizon . Have they found us again ? Frell me . Soon enough . Can Moya Starburst ? Not for some time . Activate the sensor distorter . It is not ready yet . How long until the warship identifies us ? Perhaps 200 microts . I hate to say it , but ... - Then don 't . Noranti : No one is chasing Moya and Pilot . It might be better just to leave them . Are we gonna do this ? Bail ? Safest for Moya . And what about the ... Baby ? What about the baby ? What ? Where 's the beacon , Aeryn ? We don 't know . Where 's the beacon , Aeryn ? We don 't know . - Crichton , what ... Wait ! Crichton : Where 's the beacon ? Chiana : Crichton , what are you doing ? Where 's the beacon ? It 's a simple question . Where 's the beacon ? We don 't know where the beacon is . Crichton , what are you doing ? Crichton : Where 's the beacon ? Where 's the baby ? Where 's the baby ? Where 's the beacon ? Beacon , baby , beacon , baby . Whose beacon ? Whose baby ? Who 's the beacon ? Who 's the baby ? Whose baby is it ? Who 's the daddy , Aeryn ? Aeryn , who 's the daddy ? D 'Argo , tell her who the daddy is . We don 't know who the daddy is . Right , we don 't know ... who . Say " baby , " Aeryn . Aeryn , say " baby . " Say " baby . " Spell it . A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I , J ... Where 's Aeryn , Aeryn ? ( electrical crackling ) ( hissess ) A bioloid . What 's a bioloid ? Sikozu : That . 30 microts , everyone , until a Scarran warship is close enough to identify us . Pilot , I have temporarily patched the sensor distorter to your neural pathway . I feel it . There is a choice of signatures . A Scarran ore freighter , and mimic its movements . Engaging now . The Scarran warship is signaling . Okay , let 's hear it . Ko-nach ! Ko-nach ! Frez-ne Ko-nach ! Frez-ne Ko-nach ! My mother tongue . You . Nach-ko Frey-za Kalish-ah . Scarran : Nak-ca Leh-vi-a-than ? Sikozu : Lee ! Eel-ca dir Stir-berk ! Bac-du karekko o nailn tra marden , ska brecarro , pelotin . Scarran : Az Ko-nich . Pilot : The warship is breaking off and accelerating away . What did you say to them ? I told them that we saw a Leviathan Starburst a moment ago , that we were afraid it was going to board us , and I thanked them for scaring it away . ( grunts ) ( heavy sigh ) Homing device , found in what 's left of its neural processor . That device confining Grayza was not meant to transport her . Scorpius : No . It replicates living flesh . We 've known about it for some time , but never encountered the result . D 'Argo : Effective technique . No rescue attempt while they 're at their leisure to torture Grayza . And now , her duplicate spies on the Peacekeepers . Then why did they take Aeryn ? I got away . She got caught . Noranti : Maybe they thought this creature would bring back Grayza . Or Crichton . Sikozu . ( sighing ) You okay ? No . You know , it 's not Aeryn . It was never Aeryn . We 're not gonna give up on her , John . Sikozu said the Scarrans are taking Grayza to a place called Katratzi . Maybe that 's where Aeryn is now . She could be anywhere out there . But we 're not gonna let her go . I give you my word .

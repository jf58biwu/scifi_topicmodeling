 - Can I play ? - Do you have any marbles ? Okay . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . - So , what 's your name ? - Louis . - Yours ? - Alan . You 're not from around here , are you ? No , I 'm here with my parents for the day . What ? What 's over there ? Don 't do that . We 're not even allowed to be here . Come on ! Wait for me ! Let 's go back down . Nope . Don 't ! Alan , don 't ! You see ? That wasn 't so bad . Just don 't look down . Louis ! Come on ! See ? It 's steady . - Louis ! - I can 't move ! Come on ! Alan ! Help ! Wait . Here it comes . Just relax . You 're doing fine , honey . All right now , just a couple of more seconds . Good girl . Here it comes , sweetie . Just keep-keep breathing . Now the head 's crowning . Very good . - Excellent . Oh , here we go . - One more big push , sweetie . That 's it . Now breathe . - It 's coming . - Now push ! Push ! Oh , here it comes . Beautiful . You have a boy ! - Oh , is he okay ? - Oh , he 's perfect . - He 's fine . He 's fine . - You have a beautiful son . He 's beautiful . Beautiful . - Is he okay ? - He 's fine , honey . He 's beautiful . He 's beautiful . He 's perfect . Congratulations , Dad . Here he comes . Oh , you did very well . Oh , hi . Oh , it 's okay ... Beautiful baby boy . You did really well . He 's got his eyes open . He 's looking at you . - What 's his name ? - Is Danny . - Hi , Danny . - Oh , be careful . Danny ? Danny ? Come here , sweetie , get away from the ants . See , we have the best fed ants in the neighborhood . Come on . We 'll have to do that later , after the party . Jason , my guy took your guy 's gun . Can 't . It 's attached to his leg , see ? Oh , my God . That 's me , man . That 's me . Danny , play nice with your brother . What 's that music you 're using ? I really dig it . Well , whatever it is ... it 's terrific , man . It really ... I don 't know ... suits his life somehow . So , Danny , you still drawing ? - Nope . - No ? Didn 't you want to grow up to be an artist ? That 's some of the opening sequence . The rest needs some fixes and tweaks . But right now he 's clocking in at one hour and forty minutes . Yeah , that 's cool . I just wanted to have a look before the Rememory tomorrow . You 've done a hell of a job with him , Mr. Hakman . You 've done the son of a bitch right . You 're welcome . I don 't suppose ... there was a fishing trip when we were thirteen ... just Danny and I and Dad ? - At the Cape . - Yes , that one . My God , that day is still with me . You requested it specifically . It 's there . Well ... I 'll be off then . Closing Zoe Project D. Monroe , rough cut six . Opening D. Monroe Scene 127-Q . - Danny ! Wait ! - I told you to shut up ! Danny ! Danny , stop ! You ... You deserve it , bitch ! No ! God ! Please ! Please don 't ! No ! No ! You 're crazy ! Scene 127-Q deleted . EYE Tech introduces the ninth generation of the Zoe implant . From our family to yours . Do you think we 'll be able to afford one ? I hope so . We can save . It 's worth , right , Dick ? Excuse me . This girl was a complete wreck . Drinking , drugs , in and out of schools . Then she turns 21 and she finds out about her Zoe implant . Complete one-eighty . She 's born again . Her knowing that someone would one day watch ... transforms her into this kind , gentle , loving person . So what happened ? She committed suicide . Took a dive off her balcony ... twenty-seven floors , straight onto her head . The implant was instantly vaporized . Charming story , Hasan . Please do go on . Alan ! This is a rare treat . Alan ! Michael , this is Alan Hakman . It 's an honor to meet you . Mikey 's my new assistant . - What happened to Eddie ? - Eddie freaked out on me . Strung too tight . Alan , have you seen these ? They are all over town . These anti-Zoe hippies always seemed a little crazy to me . But now they just seem ca-razy . Listen . 'It is not our place to see through other people 's eyes . That is for God and God alone . ' Anyway , how 's the Monroe project coming ? - Fine . - Just fine ? Just fine . Michael , it is your great privilege to meet this man . - He 's the best Cutter in town . - Who 's your assistant ? I don 't have an assistant . 'Cause I have a friend that 's looking to get into the racket . - She 's really talented ... - I don 't work with an assistant . You have something for me , Thelma ? Straight to business . I got a job last week that I passed on ... and I think it 's right up your alley . You know Charles Bannister ? His widow 's looking Cutter . Bannister , the EYE Tech lawyer ? He was out jogging and his heart collapsed . Wait a minute . EYE Tech let that footage out ? Jennifer Bannister won the lawsuit against them ... and claimed her husband 's implant . She insisted on having her own Cutter , too . And with good reason . We could 've taken that job , you know ? After Caldwell , our schedule 's wide open . I don 't like the ugly stuff . It gives me nightmares . And this pig Bannister , he 's human garbage . I took one look at the footage and sent it straight back . Anyway , she only hired me because you were busy with Monroe . - It 's you she really wants . - I 'm available . Good . Our friend , Alan , that 's his specialty , so to speak . If you can 't bear to look at it , he will . I 'll tell her you 'll come by tomorrow . She 'll be expecting you . - We should actually go . - Oh , yes . Rememory 's in two days and we 're still cutting picture . - Goddamn last-minute jobs . - Thelma , come on . It keeps you young . Alan . Hasan . Alan . Alan ... I 've been working on this new program for the Guillotine ... and I would really love to get your feedback on it . Maybe another time . Yeah , maybe some other time . - Put it in archives , very gently . - Sure . - All right . - Delila ? Is ' suicide under ' self-help ' ? - What are you doing here ? - I just want to talk . I 'm busy . - The store 's still open . - Yes . - It 's the eleven-thirty rush . - Books are flying off the shelf . We close in twenty minutes . This is exciting . You 've never had me over before . - You asked to see my work . - Well , you 're always working . I 'm curious about what takes up all your time . Guillotine . You 're like a mortician . Or a priest . Or a taxidermist . All of them . I mean ... you get to see life upon life . Most of us get only one , if that . What are people 's lives like ? Do they make any sense ? It all seems so massive and so random . Have you ever been to a Rememory ? No . Well ... - once a few years ago . - Whose ? My ex-boyfriend . But I couldn 't take it . I didn 't stay . Why not ? Because it just wasn 't ... It wasn 't him . And I wanted to remember him my way . Sit down . Thank you . It 's like you read my mind , Alan . I have this recurrent dream , where I 'm aging backwards . What about all the bits in-between ? It 's a miniature . Concise . Symmetrical . It 's the way the world looks to me . The way I see it . How do you do this ? It 's what I was meant to do . You were meant to live your own life too . The house was big . Enormous . Like this one . But we didn 't care whose house it was . It felt dangerous , to be there . It felt like exciting . I can see the grass . I can hear it crunching beneath our feet . And then the sprinklers came on ... All around us . And we ran . I remember that like it was yesterday . Do you recall any moments with your daughter ? This wasn 't long ago . We were watching Isabel in a school talent show . She was wonderful that night . I think ... Charles and I both felt what an amazing thing a family was . We felt it together ... while she was up there on that stage . Goodness . Excuse me . I know this is very hard , Mrs. Bannister . But it 's important . It 's the foundation of a Cutter 's work . I need you , your family ... to help me choose those moments you want to keep . I won 't be able to do your husband justice ... if I don 't understand him through you . I heard you were the best ... that you would know how to handle Charles . My husband was a great man , Mr. Hakman . He deserves to be remembered as a great man . After my initial cut , I will need to speak with Isabel . Is that necessary ? There 's nothing that any one of you can tell me ... - that I won 't know very soon . - Of course . Yes . Rom . Please call EYE Tech storage . Tell them Mr. Hakman will be dropping by . Very good , Ma 'am . Thank you . I 've ... I 've seen Rememories where the Cutters were careless . They had no respect for the dead . The dead nothing to me , Mrs. Bannister . I took this project because I respect the living . Remember for yourself ! Remember for yourself ! Live for today ! Live for today ! Live for today ! Live for today ! Live for today ! Live for today ! You are blasphemous ! Repent ! Why don 't you people go home ? Just go home ! Show some respect ! Open your eyes ! I 'm sorry , Mrs. Monroe . It 's never been this bad before . So ... this is him , huh ? That 's him . Carolin , are you alright ? Oh , you did really well . Oh , hi . Oh , it 's okay . He 's got his eyes open . He 's looking at you . - What 's his name ? - Is Danny ! - Hi Danny ! - Be careful ! Hey Danny , we got some visitors for you . Look everybody is here . Look . Look , there 's Grandpa . How you doing , Eliza ? Okay ? - I 'm good . I 'm really good . - Excellent ! Look what I made . That looks really good , Danny . Okay , now go wash out your brush . - So , Danny , you still drawing ? - Nope . No ? Didn 't you want to grow up to be an artist ? - Not any more . - No ? - What do you want to be then ? - A doctor . A doctor ? Clever kid . That 'll keep you in the bucks . Why a doctor ? 'Cause I wanna help people when they hurt . Would you listen to this little kid ? Hey , you got a good heart , Danny . And that 's all you 'll need in life . Now , come on , be a good boy and eat your lunch . Now , we make the incision here . Hand me the number seventeen , please . Actually , Professor , I think ... the number twelve would be more appropriate . Yes . Correct . The number twelve . Thank you , Mr. Monroe . Hello there . I 'm Doctor Daniel Monroe . I 've seen you around the hospital these last few days ... and I couldn 't help but notice the most beautiful woman here . I was wondering if maybe you 'd like to join me ... - for dinner sometime ? - It would be nice . It 's a strange profession you have , isn 't it , Alan ? You take people 's lives , make lies out of them . Fletcher . It 's been a long time . Eight years . Well , I don 't have time to catch up right now . I want to thank all of you ! This is the best birthday I 've ever had ! Oh , how can you handle it Alan ? People sleeping and shitting . People stealing from each other . Manipulating each other . The obscenity ! I can 't talk . I 'm working . Well , now I 'm hurt . That 's not why I 'm here . I 'm booked solid for the next two months . No , no , I don 't have a job lead for you . Actually , you do have something that I need , though . What could I possibly have that you want ? I know you 've taken the Bannister project , and I want it . I thought you 'd given up cutting . I 'm offering you five hundred thousand dollars in cash . Oh , what , the Code ? Would you forget the damn Code and grow up ? This is real life now . Did you change the color of our fishing boat ? - I would never do that . - Are you sure ? Because I remember it being green , not red . Weird . Like , all my memories in that boat ... have been green . Like , it just blew my mind . Maybe it was green . Will you excuse me ? I have to go . Okay . Rush , rush , rush . Beautiful work , Mr. Hakman . I 'll keep you in mind for me . Ah , yes , the questions . 'I remember it differently . Are you sure that 's what happened ? ' Some of us still live by the Code , Fletcher . We didn 't walk away . We have what it takes . And what does it take , Alan ? Delusion ? Obsession ? Guilt ? No , I don 't have any of those . Not as much as you do . I 'll be in touch . Wait ! It 's the Rememory your husband deserved Caroline . He really was someone special . Thank you , Natalie . Yeah ! Oh , Danny ! Danny ! Oh ! Excuse me . Mr. Hakman ? Mrs. Monroe . Why are they tattooed like that ? - I 'm not sure . - So grotesque , aren 't they ? I 'm sorry about your loss . Thank you . Look ! It 's the Cutter ! Receiving Zoe footage . Charles Bannister . Processing 544.628 life hours . Sorting life files Childhood . Sleep . Puberty . Eating . Awkward face . Romantic life . Temptation . Personal hygiene . Religion . Tragedy . Wedding . Masturbation . Fears . Athletics . Growth rate . University . Violence . School . Courtship . Career . ... for these documents , and I 'm quite concerned ... about EYE Tech 's liability . I think if ... any of this were to get out it ... could be quite devastating for the corporation . We do have a one point two billion dollars ... that we wish to invest . I 'm just wondering if EYE Tech ... if there 's anything to ... What do you think ? I love it . Thank you , Charles . Charlie ! Come help me build a sand castle . - Happy Anniversary . - Is it keys ? Dad , I am really a pallbearer ? And Dad says ... 'You 're a pallbearer for sure . Why are you asking ? Cause I 'm freezing my ass off ! ' ... actually , you need to make sure you know I can 't divulge that kind of information . ... you 'll have a car service of course . Yes , sir , but the rhododendrons they needed tending ... - Hi , baby . You still awake ? - No . Daddy loves you so much . You know that ? I love you too , Dad . Do you want to come down to my study ? I 'd like to show you what I 'm working on . - What are you working on ? - Well , it 's a new case . Come on . Okay . - So how was school today ? - Good . We read a book about Kibbie the Sparky Dog . Kibbie the Sparky Dog ? He 's a very happy dog . - Daddy ? - What , sweetie ? - Can I have a pet ? - Oh , maybe . - What kind of pet ? - Maybe a kitty . A kitty ? Of course . Go on in , honey . - Daddy ? - Yes , sweetie ? - I want to go back to bed . - In a little while , baby . In a little while . Daddy loves you so much . You know that ? I love you too , Dad . Thank you . Wasn 't she wonderful ? - You look lovely , honey . - Thank you . I 'll tell Rom to bring up some more champagne . Fine . - Would you like it , sir ? - No , Thank you . Isabel wanted to stay up and say hello ... but the poor thing fell asleep . It 's a beautiful picture . She 's a very bright little girl . Yes , she is . Jennifer and I are very lucky . We 're very fortunate . We 're looking forward to spending ... - So , what 's your name ? - Louis . - Yours ? - Alan . Image locked . Identity match . Searching . Come on ! No . I can 't move ! I can 't move ! I know you 've taken the Bannister project ... and I want it . I found something , Delila . I mean , in a new project . Something very important . And I have to explode . It 's ... A new cutting project ? That 's what you 're talking to me about , Alan ? - Well , more than that . - Alan ... you 've seen so much life , and , somehow ... you 've missed the point . I haven 't heard from you since that night in your apartment . I need you . Why ? Why do you need me ? There 's no place for me with you . You haven 't even made room for yourself . You have to separate yourself from that machine . Alan ? Alan . You look like shit . - What happened to your face ? - This ? Rather not elaborate . Come in . I mean , you decided that this scene , this event ... is what made this woman who she was ! You 've taken this woman 's entire life ... and drawn a straight line from this particular moment . How can you make a decision like that ? - Boiling a life down to one ... - Michael . We have to make story decisions . Otherwise , there will be no Rememory . Yeah , I just ... I still don 't buy it . Well , you don 't have to buy it . You just have to do it . Trust me . Alan , darling , you look spooked . Sorry ' bout the place . The kid 's a mess . I need to speak with you alone . Michael , honey , would you run down to the store ... and buy us some cigarettes ? We 've got eight packs already . Well , then go and return them , sweetheart . We don 't need so many . He 's an emotional one . Now ... are you all right ? I saw Fletcher yesterday . Really ? Fletcher . Now he was a great assistant . What happened to him after he quit ? He seems changed . We kept in touch for a few years ... and then his sister Laura , you remember Laura . She had a son , died of leukemia . He was only 12 . She never got over it . She 'd spend days and days ... watching his unedited Zoe footage ... and stopped speaking to everyone . Then she didn 't even recognize who Fletcher was . After that , he dropped off the map completely . Do you think he could be involved with anti-implant groups ? I 've heard rumors ... talk of them being organized by an ex Cutter . I never thought it could be Fletcher . He wants to buy Bannister 's footage . These anti-implant groups have become like religious fanatics . They gave Michael one hell of a beating last night . So it 's not just talk anymore . You know , if they want Bannister 's life ... the bastard 's not worth fighting for . Give the footage back to his widow . Let her deal with it . I can 't give it back . There 's someone in that project I haven 't seen for years . - I hate when that happens . - Oh , yeah . He 's at a party , in a crowd . Never mentioned by name . I 've got to find him , though . He 's not a main character in Bannister 's life . It 'll take the Guillotine days ... to track his face through the footage . Who is this person ? Just someone from my childhood . Bannister 's life is my only lead . Okay . Go through the family . Snoop around . Tell them ... you 're doing research for the project . Might be faster than waiting for the Guillotine . Be careful , Alan . So ... how is it that you and I know each other again ? We don 't . That 's the wrong answer , pal . We share a mutual friend , Billy Finch . - Billy who ? - Don 't play games . I know you 're better than that . I know all your little secrets , Oliver . How do you know my name ? I know you suffocated those kittens when you were thirteen . I know that that scar on your head was self-inflicted . and I know you sold Billy the gun ... that he killed his brother with . They say friends help you move ... but good friends help you move bodies , don 't they ? I just want what Billy wanted , a gun . Take it . Take it . And these . Take these . Take them all . Please go , okay ? Just go . Thank you , Ollie . Take care . I 'm here . This is why you wanted to meet me here ? I thought it would be safer this way . How 's Thelma doing ? I can 't give you Bannister and you know I can 't . It 's unbelievable when you think about it . One in twenty of these people has an implant . How will that baby remember his mother years from now ? Will he remember the special moments between them ... or moments someone like you decides are special ? My job is to help people remember ... what they want to remember , Fletcher . That 's noble . But I don 't think ... you understand the scope of the damage . There is no way to measure the profound effect ... the Zoe implant has had on the way ... people relate to each other . 'Am I being filmed ? ' 'Should I say this or not ? ' 'What will they think in thirty years if I do this or that ? ' And what about the simple right not to be photographed ? The right not to pop up in some guy 's Rememory ... without even knowing you were being filmed ? I didn 't invent the technology . If people didn 't want it , they wouldn 't buy it , Fletcher . It fulfills a human need . Alan , you take murderers and make them saints ! That 's why we need Charles Bannister ! He was a public figure for EYE Tech , their star attorney . Well-respected . Loved his family . Gave to charity . And if you get through with him ... that 's all anyone will ever know . But Bannister is the first EYE Tech employee ... whose implant has left the confines of the corporation . His widow fought for that ! We know she 's hiding something about him and his daughter ... and we 're going to find it . EYE Tech 's hands aren 't clean . Bannister 's implant is evidence . So you want to destroy EYE Tech with a scandal . Absolutely . The press would go apeshit . He 's the perfect candidate . I must have his footage . Is this about your sister ? Don 't even say her name . You don 't know anything about that . She has nothing to do with it . These implants distort personal history ... and therefore all history . I will not stand by while the past is rewritten ... for the sake of pleasant Rememories . Tell me something , why is your name the first on the list ... for cutting scumbags and lowlifes ? Because I forgive people long after ... they can be punished for their sins . I know what you do . Why do you do it ? Do you know what a Sin Eater is ? It 's part of an ancient tradition . When someone would die , they would call for a Sin Eater . Sin Eaters were social outcasts , marginals . They 'd lay out the body , put bread and salt on the chest ... coins upon the eyes . The Sin Eater would eat the bread and salt ... take the coins as payment . By doing this ... the Eater absorbed the sins of the deceased ... cleansing their souls and allowing them ... safe passage into the afterlife . That was their job . And what about the Sin Eater who bears the burden ... of all of those wrongs ? Are you worried about my soul , Fletcher ? - I will have Bannister . - I can 't give him to you . You see that man behind me ? I don 't want to bring him into this conversation ... but I will if you leave me no other choice . Alan . Alan ! Do you remember the moment you first fell in love ... with your husband ? Goodness . How can you answer a question like that ? - The pier ? - Yes , the pier . He had taken me down to the pier . It was springtime ... we were walking and he was going on and on ... - This was during college ? - Yes , I was in college . And I remember I looked up at him and I thought ... this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with . I just have one more question . There was a man at one of your parties ... - A man ? - Yes , a man with glasses . You may have noticed them , very thick glasses . Thick glasses ? Mr. Hakman , how is this relevant ? Minor people I don 't even know have no place in the Rememory . Family . Career . Community . That 's all I want . Cut everything else . Maybe I could speak with Isabel ? - Right now ? - It would be very helpful . Yes , of course . Isabel ? Remember what I told you ? Mr. Hakman wants to talk to you about Daddy . - It 's for Daddy 's Rememory . - Mrs . Bannister ... we have a problem with the caterers . - Hi , Isabel . - Hello , Mr. Hakman . Mr. Hakman . That 's very formal . My name is Alan . Beautiful house . What 's going on in there ? A birthday party for Mr. Froggy . Do you think Mr. Froggy would mind ... if I took you away from the party for a minute ? - Who 's that in your arms ? - My doll . - What 's her name ? - She doesn 't have a name . She 's just a doll , see ? Isabel , your daddy ... My daddy is the best daddy in the world . He had this really big meeting one day ... but instead he took me horseback riding . He would read me stories before bed every night . Sometimes he would make it up as he went along ... and I knew but I didn 't care . Your mom said I was here to talk about your dad ... but we don 't have to do that if you don 't want . - I don 't want . - Okay , then we won 't . When I was a little older than you , I lost both of my parents . Not many people know what you 're feeling . Not many people understand . But I do . You don 't want me nosing around , asking questions . And you 're right . Alan , it 's not really Mr. Froggy 's birthday . It 's in a week . Can I ask one question and then I 'm gone ? There was a man who was at one of your parents ' parties . The things that 's special about this man ... is he wore glasses that were very , very thick . They 're almost like the bottom of a glass bottle . Mr. Hunt . I took him the invitation . Mr. Hunt ? - Was his name Louis Hunt ? - He was my teacher . Really ? What does he teach ? He doesn 't teach anymore ... he died in a car accident a year ago . It was very sad . Did you have a Rememory , like for your father ? I don 't know . We just had a day at school ... where we talked about him . Thank you , Isabel . Alan ? Are you going to fix what my daddy can remember ? In a way , yes . Can you make him forget that I ... that I drew on his contract with crayon ? I will . And that I pulled Dotty 's hair so hard that she cried ... will he forget that ? He 'll forget . But make sure you don 't . Hey , Alan ... would you relax ? There 's nobody following us , all right ? You know , this is a really big favor I 'm doing for you . You 're lucky my cousin Karim is working late tonight . Thank you . - So what 's this guy 's name ? - Louis Hunt . Well , if he had an implant ... there 'll be a record of it in here . I could lose my job letting Cutters in here . Come on , Karim , would I get you in trouble ? They can track anyone accessing data from a computer ... so this is the best I can do . Please hurry . All right . Wait . These are genealogies . I don 't know his family tree . - How do I use this ? - No , no . Hard copies are sorted by series numbers . Alphabetically on the boxes and then arranged by implant date . He was the same age as I am , so ... 1500 series . Yeah , that 's it . Hunt ... No ' Hunt ' ! Alan ! - Alan , are you okay ? - I 'm fine . Hello , Mr. and Mrs. Hakman ... and welcome to the EYE Tech family . You 've made an important decision . You 've purchased a Zoe implant for your unborn son . What does that mean ? Immortality . No longer do our most cherished moments together ... have to fade and disappear over time . Remember , the Zoe implant is entirely organic ... and , since it grows with your baby 's brain ... and nerve centers , it 's virtually undetectable . When is the right time to tell your child ... about their miraculous gift ? By their 21st birthday ... most carriers are mature enough to understand . And from then on , your son can live his life ... knowing that always and forever ... his experiences and adventures ... will be revisited and relished . And that 's what great memories are made of . Congratulations . Oh , my God ! That 's me , man . That 's me . You take people 's lives , make lies out of them . My daddy is the best daddy in the world . It 's unbelievable when you think about it . One in 20 of these people has an implant . When is the right time to tell your child ... - about their miraculous gift ? - Cut everything else . - That 's all I want . - What are people 's lives like ? Do they make any sense ? It all seems so massive , so random . - This is real life now . - Don 't do that . We 're not ... - even allowed to be here . - Come on ! You take murderers and make them saints ! - Who is this person ? - He 's someone from my childhood . And what about the Sin Eater ... who bears the burden of all those wrongs ? Get out of my head ! Alan ... your phone call had me so worried . I saw the mirror . - What happened to you ? - I saw something . All right , you cannot let your work get to you like this . Please don 't leave . So , what 've you got to eat in this dump ? Not much . Try looking in the cupboards . The cupboard . I saw that in a project I was working on . An herbalist . It looked interesting . It 's disgusting ! Well , I guess we order out then . I want to show you something . I 've never showed to anyone . - What is this ? - Some implants have a defect . They can 't differentiate shape between ... what the eye sees and what the mind sees . What ? Where were these , in dreams ? Dreams . Daydreams . Hallucinations . It 's so beautiful . Where are you off to , Alan ? Let 's do this . No , no . Not now . There 's somebody up there . This has to be clean . No mess . Clean , dirty . It 's all the same to me . I think he 's a Cutter . Do you wanna do ? Yeah , I 'll do . You need to follow her . - You know how this works . - Not at all . We draw Synth Tattoos with electro-synthetic ink ... and it creates a magnetic field ... which interferes with the Zoe implant ... blocking it from recording audio and video ... from that point on . Now , first we do the audio tattoo ... and we wait a week . If you don 't get a migraine and your system takes it ... then we 'll do the video tattoo . Do I have to cover my whole face ? No . Those guys , they 're just young and angry . You want it discreet . Very . Will this hurt ? Fletcher ? I 'm armed . What 's the matter , Delila ? You know that recurring dream I have ? You know that recurring dream I have ? Where I get younger and younger , I had it again . I make you happy ? Well , I make myself miserable . Well , that 's just 'cause you 're just silly . You 're silly . How can you not be happy right now ? I think the first books I read were really , really sad . Why do they make children 's books so sad ? They 're always terribly tragic . Not so hard to make this thing play discs . - Not so hard at all . - Delila ? Shut up ! That was my old boyfriend , you bastard . Is that why you wanted to be with me ? 'Cause you saw some proof that I 'm to your liking ? - No ! - These moments ... they belong to me , Alan ! The good and the bad ! They 're mine and his ! Who are you to take them away from me ? No ! Stop ! Don 't touch me ! - Who are you ? - Please , please don 't . - Who are you , Alan ? - No ! No ! Why did you do that ? Mine ! You 're still here . Alan , this thing is junked . The implant itself is severed . God himself could not retrieve that footage . And you know that . Then we have to access a different life . Well ... where is it ? - My implant . - What ? The one in my head . Want to take a shot , too ? Everybody else has . I deserved that one . You deserve a lot more than that , Hakman . - Why didn 't you tell us , Alan ? - Because I didn 't know ... 'till I found the files at EYE Tech . I never thought my parents could afford one . Turns out they took a loan to get it . How could you not know ? Because they died before they told me . They just never got around to it . You know the Code , Alan . It 's one of our central tenets . A Cutter cannot have a Zoe implant . I need to access that footage . I need it right now . Yeah ? Well , that 's impossible . Oh , no , it 's possible . It was done before . By you . An attempt to access footage while the carrier was still alive . I performed that . And the woman never recovered , Alan . And I will not try that again . Then you know what it 's like to be haunted . One memory ... one single incident has made me who I am . It won 't leave me be . The guilt tears me apart . But now I got a chance to find out the truth ... and I have to take it . Alan , you brought an implant amongst us . Why should I help you ? If I try it myself , I 'll die . And I will try it myself . We 've been friends for too long , my dear . Can 't let you kill yourself , can I ? But you understand , you can never Cut again . Last time I tried this , the woman 's nervous system ... shut down immediately . It couldn 't handle it . She was a blank for the rest of her life . Now remember , you can 't copy anything ... into a hard drive . You can only watch . You know exactly which scene you 're going to ? - I sure do . - You have 5 minutes . Anything longer than that is just too risky . Christy ! I remember her . It 's me . Alan ! Almost there . There we are . Come and get me . Let 's go back down . Don 't ! I 'll meet you back on the ground floor . Hold on . I 'm coming . No . Wait . Wait . It isn 't steady anymore . Louis , please ! Just stop ! - I can 't move ! - Okay , Louis , you can make it . Just a few more steps . Grab my hand ! Wait ! Alan ! - We 're done ! - Alan , unplug it . No , not yet . Alan ! Alan ! Alan ? I 'm all right . Do you have any idea how close you came ? I saw him . I tried to help . I told him to turn around . He wouldn 't listen . He fell ... but he was breathing . It wasn 't blood . It was paint . Now I remember . Thank you . Looking for this ? The implant 's history . You 'd better find yourself another perfect candidate . Do you know how much planning it took ... to make Bannister 's footage available ? Do you ? He died of a coronary complication . I was the complication ! Or didn 't you get to that point yet ? I guess no one will . I bet he still keeps good notes . Don 't you , Alan ? - All of it ? - All of it . It was a terrible accident . Sometimes the older Guillotines can damage a Zoe implant . There 's no replacing your husband 's life . He deserved a Rememory , a place in your Zoe family tree . I 'm sorry . - You will waive your fee ? - Of course . And you 'll never speak of Charles to anyone . What can one do ? Accidents will happen . Perhaps some things are best forgotten . Perhaps . God , Isabel , you scared me . Isabel , honey , what 's the matter ? Isabel ! Isabel ... What 's wrong , honey ? Isabel ! A friend ? Yeah , something like that . I hear you 're not Cutting anymore . Well , I 've had enough of other people 's lives . Stop , Alan . - I can 't let you go . - What now ? Word travels fast in my circles . And the word is a Cutter came in for a Synth tattoo . Word is that Cutter is you . You saw that implant . It was destroyed . It 's useless . You . Bannister 's footage is gone , but you 've seen his life . It 's encrypted into your implant . Will you look at that ? Come and get me ! My daddy 's the best daddy in the world . He had a really big meeting one day ... but he took me horseback riding instead . He would read me stories every night . Sometimes he would make it up as he went along ... and I knew but I didn 't care . - Dad ? - Yes , sweety ? - Alan , please . I wanna go back to bed . It 's John 's birthday ! Italian ! You love Italian ! - A toast ! Happy Birthday John . - Happy birthday , Fletcher . - Thanks , Alan . - Alan ! Alan , would you put the newspaper ? Come on ! Would you lighten up and be gay for a moment ? Come on . It 's for the greater good , Alan . Your life will mean something . I promise .

 Previously on Farscape ... Scarran warriors outnumber Peacekeeper soldiers ten to one . But if and when they attack we will lose , Braca . Unless we harness a superior weapon . Yes . Wormhole technology . Without it ... The Sebacean race will be overwhelmed , thousands of cycles of history , gone What 's Talyn doing ? He 's aiming at us . - Droga . - Pare . Shut down , Talyn ! Shut down ! Talyn ... You know ... what must happen next . let us take away your pain . Synchronized nerve impulses . We have almost closed the deal . Put it on . Those wearing the bracelets will feel each others pain . I don 't see another option . Scorpius has the knowledge from my brain and i 'm not gonna let him shaft the Universe with it . I 'm going to the Command Carrier . I 'm going to stop Scorpius . we all gonna die . And now , on Farscape ... John ... Oh , turn back , John . Shut up , Private . We 're goin ' in . If Scorpius discovers you intend to sabotage his wormhole research ... he 'll kill you John , and if you perish ... so do I Thought you wanted to die . Not any more . I want to survive . Then follow orders . I 'll do my best . Trust me on that . Crichton ... D 'Argo and Rygel just reported in from the Command Carrier . Scorpius is sending marauders to escort us in . Or blast us into particles . - Why is your hair red ? - Because I 'm anxious , okay ? I don 't know why we 're doing this . I don 't know why I came along . And I don 't know why we didn 't jump ship when you said we would . Cause we 'd be no where near a populated planet . - You know what ? We could 've stayed on Moya . - Aeryn . Turn the pod around . Let 's take these two back . Moya is over four arns away . And hiding with Talyn by now . Pilot ? Are you parked ? Yes , Moya has towed Talyn to the agreed upon rendezvous point . Pilot ? What was that ? Moya is under great stress . She ought to see us . But she assures me , she will ... endure I hope we can say the same . Welcome . Let 's test the jewelry . All right . Just checking . - Treating you all right ? - So far . Food could be better . John Crichton ... I grant you John , and your companions ... full diplomatic rights , immunities ... and courtesies whilst aboard this vessel . At last . The rift between us is finally bridged . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... this living ship ... of escaped prisoners ... my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen Or should I stay to protect my home ... not show them you exist But they will never know ... the wonders that I 've seen . So tell me , John . What finally brought you here ? Dominar Rygel claimed you preferred the Peacekeepers to the Scarrans . Any other reasons ? Moya . Pilot . Aeryn . D 'Argo . They 've been through hell ... in large part due to me . It 's time I did something for them . Do not ... screw with them , Scorpius . Give them what they want . It 's a good deal for you . Oh . Uncontested . There is one thing more we want . Talyn is presently inoperative . He needs to be brought aboard ... for a full cognitive system replacement . That was not part of the agreement . So ? You called off the retrieval squad . Fixin ' up Talyn is ' chump change ' . Bringing a gunship aboard is too much to ask . His weapons have been deactivated . Techs will remove them . He will be reprogrammed and set free . No guns ; no Peacekeeper memories ; no emotional problems What incentive is there for us to work on Crais 's .. Braca , you wanna go another round with me ? We can take this outside . Talyn can go to hell . Crais can go to hell . This is for me , not him . Granted . Then show me to my quarters and get me the project schematics so I can isolate Talyn 's design flaws . I 'll need a Leviathan specialist . I request Lieutenant Larell . For , ah ... any particular reason ? Only that she 's the best qualified Your shipmates have been invited to refreshment in the ah ... officers lounge . Shall we join them ? No . Thank you . I came to work . For , or against me ? Full immunity to escaped prisoners . It 's frelling madness We shouldn 't be welcoming these criminals . We should be executing them ! Make yourselves comfortable . Traitor . There 's a lot of hostility among the crew . They feel you betrayed them by misusing your command . So do I. I 'm delighted to have you assisting us . We 've prepared you a-a workstation . Tell me what you ... require . I 'll have someone obtain it for you . Workstation . Seems limited . I don 't assist . - John ! The intention was ... - Screw you and your intentions , Scorp . I do not eat at the kiddie table . Now , you either give me the big toys , or you send me home . Not as salubrious as your previous accommodations . Still , considering the fact you should be in our brig , I suppose you can 't complain . Don 't bother searching for surveillance . You 're not that important . Lieutenant Braca . I predicted your rise in this organization . I stand by that prediction . You are a consummate ... Peacekeeper . This is too weird , being here . How long were you a prisoner ? Eight cycles . And you were born here , grew up within these walls ? It must have been awful . It 's just chance . Well , I 'll get it back . Cheers ... No . It wasn 't awful . Room for another ? No . But I have currency ... and , ah ... other things ... I don 't see anything . No ? Look closer . Chiana , I think we should be moving along . We 're just getting to know each other . I know exactly what you are . A Nebari tralk . And a Luxan who took a Sebecean wife and then murdered her . D 'Argo , we didn 't come here to fight . No . No , I wouldn 't dream of it . Lieutenant Reljik . We were just getting to know each other . Ah , Braca . Crichton 's now arrived , so keep your promises . You owe me a full intelligence report on the Hynerian political situation . Here it is . Ah , and you can undergo your surgery anytime you choose . That wasn 't the only thing I requested . We 're working on the other thing . Work faster . For the love of cholak . I heard you were here , but I didn 't believe it . Will you have a drink with me ? Thank you ... but I only drink with Peacekeepers . And this colonates the organic residue analyzer which , ah ... is tryin ' to figure out why your wormhhole pilots are turnin ' to goo . You know of the tissue liquification effect ? Yeah . It happened to Linfer when she tried to defect to Moya . What did Linfer tell you ? Not a lot . She died . Tell you what , why don 't you pull up her phase progression equations . Let 's see how they compare to the stuff your ... chip pulled out of my brain . Fellas ... open the bag or call me a cab , I cannot work blind . How 's the pain ? I can increase the anaesthetic mist . You doin ' all right , big guy ? Well enough . Only it 's taking slightly longer than I expected . My apologies . These rings weren 't designed to be removed . The bone will knit shortly , however and the blood is running clear . You 're safe from infection in here . Relax there for a few arns . The griltto mist will help you heal . Apparently it 's safe to talk in here . Crais says that the mist interferes with their surveillance equipment . Well , he should know . It was his boat . How you holdin ' up ? Well , I wish I was elsewhere . Yeah . Have you decided on a plan ? Plan A ... was to wipe all their data , send them back to square one . That would work if I could find the erase button . Plan B ... steer ' em in the wrong direction , ' cept I don 't know which way that is . - I 'm startin ' to look at Plan C. - Which is ? Forget the whole thing and run like hell before they kill us . Are you serious about that one ? No ... just tell the others not to get comfortable . Trust me , they won 't . Well , that 's it for me . How the frell can Scorpius allow that Luxan on board ? Can 't stand Luxans . Never could . Me neither . Looking down his ugly nose at us . Like to wipe that sneer off his face . So would I. You know what might give him a good scare ? Have you still got that thing they ... built for you for the battle of Stalaro ? I don 't like it . I don 't trust Scorpius . Are we gonna die here ? What do you mean ? In this room , or in a Command Carrier ? Luxan ! Peacekeeper . Get up . Oh , frell . Merda - D 'Argo ! - No Don 't move . Oh , dear . Reljik , if anyone , and I mean anyone , touches our guests ... there will be two executions- - The offenders and yours . Dismissed ! Can anybody think of a reason why we shouldn 't head straight back for Moya ? No . We were assured safe passage . But , John , Ka D 'Argo , I do apologize . But , this will not happen again . That 's right . Because I 'm taking Jool , Chiana and Rygel back to Moya . Unnecessary ! The fewer of us onboard , the less likely one of your people is to get hurt . Yes , and the less incentive for you to keep your promises . Those who wish to return , may . But . Speaking of promises ... Braca . Give him the file on Macton . Latest activites ... current location . Thank you . - Lieutenant . - Captain . No longer . What were you told ? Only to assist you as required . And are you displeased with this assignment ? Why would I be ? Working with someone who has ... lost his command . Scorpius stole your command ! I knew he squeezed you out of power . What else do you know ? That even though you left without a word ... I never changed my feelings for you . Scorpius . He knows about our past . He put me in the Aurora chair- - found out everything . He said if I didn 't spy on you , he 'd destroy me . Why are you telling me this ? For the last two cycles , I hated you . It was the only way I could get through it . It 's as I expected . Everyone who knew me ... would be coerced into spying . I don 't hate you . I don 't hate you either . These are design specs , right ? It 's our latest approach ... to create an external field that stabilizes a wormhole before entry . You 're using this entire ship 's hull as a wave repeater . Yes , the-the ship 's mass itself acts as a multiplier . If we knew the sub-harmonic formulas , we could find the right resonance pattern . No progress ? Uh , not as yet , so far we haven 't been able to ... to postulate any further equations , no . Why not ? Because ... we keep being interrupted . I 'm sorry , John . But we must move faster . The equations we need are in here . Don 't touch me . Locked away . I can 't get at ' em . Well , perhaps you 're holding back . - Grasshopper , you tried to snatch the feather from my head- - ! - You should let- - let me finish ! You may well be making every conscious effort , but sub-consciously ... you may still believe ... that I will misuse the wormhole technology . You say you 're only after Scarrans , I 'm cool with that . - Long as it 's true . - It is . - Maybe I can prove it to you . - What 's that ? Excerpts from my file . Documenting my life before I joined the Peacekeepers . Uh huh , what 's that gonna tell me ? Why I despise Scarrans . Scorpius 's data chip made for interesting viewing , don 't you think , John ? The Scarrans . Are they really the threat he claims ? Or is he just out for revenge ? What do you think ? I share his intellect , but not his passions nor his fears . Yes . My assessment would be more objective than his . And I concur with him . The Scarrans ... pose a threat to all our species . Cheer up , John . Scorpius has shown his biography to very few . He must be trusting you now . Yeah ... yeah , that 's interesting , considering I 've been lying to his face . Uh ... I 've managed to , uh ... normalize your energy signature . Scorpius can 't detect you 're lying . We may yet survive this , John . Hoo-yaw ! - Oh ... it 's magnificent . - Braca , stand down . He 's harmless . His weapons have been deactivated . And I 'm to take your word for it ? Take my word , Lieutenant . That ship 's biologics are on minimal auto-support . All its other systems are dead . Care to board Talyn and see for yourself ? And he believed your confession ? Yes . He trusts me completely . Group Leader Devlin , trials commence in ten microts . Reform and execute This is nice . It 's planetary terrain reconstruction for combat training . There 's about forty on the ship . Look , Scorpy thinks that ... Scarrans are ... public enemy number one . They want to wipe out all the lesser species . Is that true ? It 's what we were taught . Great . And what if the Peacekeepers ... never develop wormhole tech ? What if that 's the only way to keep the ... Scarrans at bay ? Well , they 'll have to find another way to repel the Scarrans . But that 's not your problem . You should be focusing on what you came here to do . Yeah , yeah , I know , I know . It 's just ... it 's just goin ' so damn slow . The stuff in my head . You know what ? I could be here for a while . Maybe it 's best if you don 't stay . ... and calls for Dominar Bishan 's abdication have spread to four of the primary home worlds . By the Hynerian gods ! Orrhn wasn 't lying . Bishan 's in disfavor ! If I returned , I could muster up an army , incite an uprising and restore myself to power ! I can see it now . The [ unintelligible ] of my supporters ... 'Rygel ! Rygel ! ' - Pilot , Pilot , what 's wrong ? - With what ! ? All systems report normal function . No-no-no . You were screaming . I-I had a vision , y-you were screaming . But there 's nothing wrong . Ships approaching ! Peacekeeper ships . A marauder and two prowlers . Approaching fast . - Another retrieval squad ? - Frelling Scorpius . - Starburst now , Pilot . - Yes . Prepare for immediate starburst . Oh . This ship is amazing . I understand why you took control of him . The ... the neural interface . What was it like ? A thousand different sensations all at once . Yet you 're willing to give him up ? No choice . Ultimately , Talyn would not be commanded . Ultimately , neither would you . My inability to take orders is why I am no longer a captain . Do you regret leaving the Peacekeepers ? Sometimes . What I regret most of is that I didn 't ... - try to take you with me . - I wouldn 't have gone . Not then . What do you want ? I want to talk to you . Do you have something to say ? Where should I start ? What happened ? Am I a traitor ? Well , that depends upon your definition . Define it how you like . You 're the one who left . Well , no I didn 't have a choice in that . Crais decided I was irreversibly contaminated and he threw me out . And then he turned renegade and he got thrown out . You could have come back . It was too late then . You think you didn 't have a choice ? I didn 't want to come back . Then you are a traitor . A deserter , perhaps . Can you tell me why ? If you really want to know ... Alert ! All cannon crew and prowler pilots report to stations . A captured leviathan is being escorted to docking area . Linfer suggested this formula . I disagreed . You two argue alot ? She was a great mind and a ... a tragic loss . Yeah , I really didn 't get a chance to know her , but I liked her . You ... obviously liked her . That 's good . This is wrong . Do you see a flaw in her extrapolation ? Just a hunch . Excuse me . That 's not right . But . There it is ... another way to go . Crichton They 've captured Moya . Scorpius What is this ? Scorpius gave orders that this ... I gave orders . Lieutenant Reljik , isn 't it ? I am honored you remember , Ma 'am . Thrice decorated by High Command , if I recall correctly . You do , Ma 'am . Would you be so good as to watch over these prisoners for me ? Ma 'am . Luxan . Move . A security lockdown is in effect , priority Velkar Nine . No one is permitted What have you done ? This Gammak project ... is under my authority . Your authority is not absolute ... Scorpius . Let me introduce K 'or Tosko , Special Luxan Ambassador . The Luxans have signed a defense agreement ... with the Peacekeepers . I have been sent to promote other such alliances . But half the planets I visit , fear Peacekeepers . The other half laugh at us ... for our simple inability to capture a handful of escaped prisoners whose exploits are becoming legendary . Why should we care what insignificant systems think ? We 're uniting as much of the Uncharted Territories as possible . To improve our bargaining position with the Scarrans . The Council intends to negotiate ? A truce is being explored . A truce won 't prevent an invasion . As a show of weakness , it may even hasten one . Hence the alliances . To show strength . Showing strength is useless ! My project will give us strength ! Crichton , stop ! Where is Scorpius ? He didn 't capture Moya . Like hell he didn 't . Moya turned herself in ? It wasn 't Scorpius . - Let him explain . Let me take you to him . - What a good idea . Even if these chimerical wormholes of yours had some military value ... now is not the time to provoke the Scarrans . The very existence of this project imperils a truce . The very idea of a truce ... imperils every Sebacean . I know Scarrans . I understand them more than you ever will . Appeasement ? Suicide . In you go . Hey , Hopper ! Let ' em go ... Or I will ... kill you , bracelet or no bracelet . Calm down , John , calm down ! Moya and your friends are unharmed . Well , we 'd like to see them . You can 't . I 've taken them into custody . Have we met ? Commandant Mele-on Grayza . And you must be ... the infamous John Crichton . Infamous ? Two points ... Commandant . One : your boy here has made a lot of promises which you should keep because , two : when my friends are threatened , I am infamous ... for making really stupid moves . Yes ? Point two is clearly correct , but I cannot accept point one . You 've completely lost control . Not yet . This is Scorpius . Moya and her crew are to be released at once . Braca . Have a security team report to my quarters . They will accommodate Commandore Grayza and her retinue to their vessel . A prowler detail ... will escort them out of this sector . Sir . All right , Scorpius. we 'll do this the hard way . I 'll return with a full Council sanction . You shouldn 't have made me into an enemy . And you shouldn 't have pointed a weapon at me . Damn , I gotta stop pointing ' guns at people . Scorpius . I need a comms channel . You heard Scorpius . Release the prisoners . Ma 'am , are you sure ? Do ... as you are ordered ... Lieutenant . Don 't ... touch me . Crichton . We were attacked . Immobilizer ... pulse . I know , Pilot . It 's ... it 's all right . Moya won 't accept a control collar . Rather be dead . There 's not going to be ... a control collar . Tell him . Crichton is correct . Your capture was an error . This situation will not occur again . He means it , Pilot , and tell Moya I 'm gonna hold him to it . Thank you , Commander . John . Now you know what stupidity I have to deal with . You must not fail . Reljik here . I 'm alone . Comms encryption is engaged . Lieutenant , I intend to remove Scorpius from command . I 'm sure most of us here would fully approve of that action . But going through channels takes time , and given the crew 's low opinion of Scorpius ... I 'm concerned for his safety . He is well protected ... but because of the I-Yensch bracelet , he is vulnerable through ... John Crichton . Then I am equally concerned for Crichton 's safety . I will do my best to address your concerns , Ma 'am . Thank you , Lieutenant . Ah , a simple game . Not very diverting , unless it 's played for currency . Oh , I don 't want to be diverted . I just want Crichton to finish his work so we can go . Oh , we 'll go , whether he 's finished or not . But we may as well take some Peacekeeper winnings with us . Play . - Then you 've rejected our ideals ? - No , not all of them . I 've actually kept loyalty , sacrifice , honor . Not all Peacekeepers believe in those ideals you know . I still do . Yes , I 'm sure you do . Aren 't you ever worried that you might be fighting for the wrong cause ? No . Never . What about the wrong leaders ? He is here under the Peacekeeper-Luxan pact . I cannot believe that the Luxans made a pact with the Peacekeepers . They 're merely pledged to fight any Scarrans attack . They remain autonomous . Yes but ... for how long ? The knowledge the Ancients put in my head is startin ' to do its job . I can see which paths will work and which ones a dead end . So you will be able to steer Scorpius onto the wrong path ? Yeah , I can screw up his research for years to come . Why aren 't you happy about that ? 'Cause I 'm not a hundred percent sure it 's the right thing to do . The other John gave up his life to stop the Scarrans from getting this information . I know , but ... it 's my shift now . He didn 't know what we know . He didn 't get Scorpy 's backstory . He didn 't see Scorpy put his ass on the line for us . So , what ... now you 're actually considering helping Scorpius ? No . It 's just not clear what my next move is . Well then you get clear . I said I 'd back you up , and I will . But you have to make a decision . Bialar . I know you may not believe me , but ... you could come back . To the Peacekeepers ? Scorpius despises me as much as I despise him . This wormhole project ... it means everything to him . As does loyalty . Give him what he wants from Crichton . Show Scorpius you 're not his enemy . What ? I think we 're being followed . Through there . Don 't touch anything . What is this place ? It 's a generator . It 's unlikely we 'll be followed through here . Yeah . It 's a good place for an ambush . Got ' em , Sir . Junction three , lurg eight . Well , our odds aren 't going to get any better . Ah , hell , karate man ! Braca ! Crichton is being assaulted ! Find him ! Crichton , get clear ! What ? No pulse weapons . Not in here ! Oh , yes . John Crichton . He 's here ! Sir ! I 'm all right . Crichton ? We 're checking every level , Sir . Frell . This is just not fair . Crichton , where are you ? Up top ! About to blow up ! Aeryn ! Just in case there 's anymore assassination attempts . Hey , how 'd it ... feel at your end ? Like time is running out . Commandant Grayza ... will return very soon . Work it out , Scorp . Get your ship under control . They were after me to get at you . Realize that the situation has now changed ! Our fates are now well and truly linked . We have been over this . I am still trying to assimilate all the data your people collected . Grayza 's arrival ... drastically changes our timetable . It is Einstein 's timetable . God , it 's God 's timetable , Scorp . Fix your end . I 'm doin my bit . Are you ? Why are you bitchin ' at me like we 're married , Scorpy-Sue ? Just tell me what 's on your mind . I suspect you 're stalling ... either through ignorance , or by design . I hoped you 'd see reason . What do you think ... I see ? Huh ? I 'm here . On a big , stinkin ' Command Carrier . Dick Tracy 's freakin ' neural bracelet linkin ' me to Bram Stoker 's nightmare . What more ... do you want ... from me ? Cooperation ... You stole that ... from my memory . You will kill both of us . I reckon so . It took quite some effort to triangulate the stars from your planet . More ... to gain a visual confirmation ! Get the hell offa me , you freak ! Even without wormholes , Earth is reachable . At top speed ... Just over sixty cycles . You give me what I want , or I swear ... I will keep you alive so that you can witness your home worlds destruction ! SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

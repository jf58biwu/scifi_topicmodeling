Destination Double X Charter Airport selected . She wouldn 't stop talking . My virtual girlfriend talks but I can turn her off . You and your virtual girls . You 're a grown man , and your primary relationship is with software . If your senses say there 's a hot chick on your lap , there is one . I don 't have to look any further . They invented the Laser Razor . No nicks or cuts . You should use it . I like the old-fashioned kind . They remind me I 'm still alive . You want to hang out at Kelly 's after work ? I know that Natalie is throwing me a surprise party . - Why do you say that ? - I told her you told . - No , you didn 't . - Oh , yes . Why did you do that ? I didn 't . I just wanted to know and now I know . I was that easy . Your destination , Double X Charter Airport , is ahead . OnStar will now disengage automatic drive . - Are you ready ? - Yes . Manual drive engaged . Do me a favor at the party . Don 't get drunk and set the drapes on fire ? You already told me . That too . What I was going to say was around 11 : 30 I want you to start singing really loud , " Happy Birthday . " - For what ? - The way you sing it 'll clear the place . I get it . You and Natalie have a little private party planned . Good morning , Rosie . Good morning , everybody . Henry checked out the remote . Says you 'll love it . They came in . This is great . Look at this . And Drucker 's office called . Guess what ? They canceled . No . We 're going to be tested for drugs and alcohol . So ? Oh , this is cool . We 're going to be tested ? Not you guys . Just us pilots . Look at this . The new remote came in . Out goes the old one . Get rid of it ! Adam , this is Tripp . It 's his first time with us . - Welcome . - How you doing ? Adam ? Natalie 's on line one . What 's up , honey ? You look upset . Oh , Adam . I just talked to the vet and they had to put Oliver to sleep . What ? He wasn 't that sick . I know , I know . But apparently he had some kind of highly infectious virus . They had to put him down . It 's the law . Oliver was licking Clara 's face . Don 't worry . I asked the same thing and the virus is harmless to humans . So , she 's fine . This 'll break her heart , you know that . No , it won 't . I want you to go down to RePet and get Oliver replaced . I 'm not going to have some freak of science sleep in my daughter 's bed . - It 's not dangerous . - No . Oliver can live in our memories . She 's only 8 . She won 't understand that . It 's the natural process of life . You 're born , you live and you die . She has to learn about it . But not on your birthday . I appreciate that . - Will you do it ? - No . Thank you . And Clara thanks you . - Love you . Bye . - Natalie , I won 't - Double X Charter . Your passport to adventure . No use fighting . We always win . For incredible skiing and snowboarding , Double X Charter . - Tripp , you can go in this one . - You got it . You guys come with me . Let 's go ! Man , this is gonna be so great ! 9747 , you are cleared for takeoff . Everyone has their maps ? GPS ? Emergency beacons ? Good . Any questions ? I got a question . How many of you have RePets ? - I have a dog . - I got a snake . - At least know somebody who has one ? - I get your point . - I know somebody . - I was just asking . You scared me . - You proud of yourself ? - Very . See you guys ! I know you 're old-school , but all the kids today grew up with RePets . These days it 's totally normal . Not to me . Not to you ? You want her crying all night because her dog died ? Where 's your heart ? - Don 't you think it 's a little creepy ? - No . I don 't . Let 's test the remote . Keep up . All righty . Here we go . These RePets come back , you can 't tell the difference . Trust me . - I had it done . - Bullshit . I 'm serious ! Sadie , my cat ... she 's a RePet . You had her cloned ? Well , she fell out of my condo window . - You did well . - Thank you . How long are you to keep me ? Till 7 . Why ? Maybe I should check out RePet . Good morning . Are you gentlemen the owners ? Yep , that 's us . Excellent . Larry Stern , I 'm with Mr. Drucker 's advance team . I 've got a contract here . You 'll find it pretty standard except for ... - Who was flying that one ? - Me , with the remote control . We can fly four of these between the two of us now . - Amazing . - You here for the blood test ? No . My technician is set up in your office . These forms are standard except what ? It has a nondisclosure clause . During the flight you may overhear Mr. Drucker 's phone calls . Anything from big mergers to inside information on his sports teams . We have a legal obligation to protect that stuff . This guy think he 's the president ? He considers her to be the world 's second most important person . That 's big stuff . All for a day of snowboarding ? The blood test was agony . Seriously , I was screaming . She 's kidding . Don 't worry about it . It doesn 't hurt . Press your thumb here . - Right here ? - Just like that . - All done . - Didn 't feel a thing . Now your vision . Place your chin here . Right here ? Do you blood-test all your pilots ? Pilots , drivers , security , assistants . Basically , anyone who comes in contact with Mr. Drucker . I press here ? And here . Perfect , both of you . After this , I 'm going to town to test a chef and two waiters . The pink copy of the charter contract is yours . I 'll take the rest . - Here we go . - Have a nice flight , gentlemen . I can take Drucker . That way , you 'll have time to get Oliver cloned . I 'm not getting the dog cloned . I 'm just gonna check it out . I know , but once you see it , you 'll say yes . Deep down inside , you 're a softy . They specifically asked for Adam by name . I know . I also know that the bodyguards can 't tell the difference . They never got our names . That 's true . Adam , I know I screw around a lot , but when it comes to flying you know I 'm serious . I could do it . Go enjoy your birthday . If you want to be me , try to act a little bit more manly . Chest out . Stomach in . There you are . All right . - All clear . - I want the Speaker of the House . Don 't mention my name at all . I 'm Michael Drucker . You must be Adam Gibson . Adam 's the name and flying 's the game . Pete Hume says you know the mountains like nobody else . That 's probably true for everyone except my partner . I 'm looking forward to it . - We all set ? - We 've stationed our people - - Don 't need the details . - Yes , sir . Your snowboard 's behind your seat . Dave , look , we gave a lot of money to his campaign not to mention what I pay your law firm , so I 'm counting on you . Get me the Speaker . Good . Sally , who 's next ? Okay , put him on . Hey , you own the Roadrunners , right ? Hey , buddy , wake up . Wake up . We 're here . Woodland Mall . I was asleep . Welcome to Woodland Mall . Over 1200 retail outlets to serve you . Food court , ground level . Megaplex theater , 15th level . Stop the cloning . Say no to RePet . Stop the cloning . God doesn 't want you to go in there . Then God shouldn 't have killed my dog . Atheist . We can clone your four-legged loved one in a few hours . How can we do it ? It begins with growing " blanks " animal drones stripped of characteristic DNA in embryonic tanks at the RePet factory . In stage two , your pet 's DNA is extracted from a lock of fur or a drop of blood then infused on a cellular level into the blank . In the final stage , using RePet 's cerebral syncording process all your pets thoughts , memories and instincts are transplanted via the optic nerve . Still can 't make up your mind , huh ? You lost a dog , right ? Yes , my daughter 's . What a heartbreak . - What did you say was his name again ? - Oliver . Oliver 's in luck because we 're having a special this week , 20 percent off . - When did Oliver die ? - This morning . Perfect . We can do a post-mortem syncording but act fast because there 's a 12-hour window on deceased brains . I have a problem with the whole idea . Suppose the clones have no soul or they 're dangerous ? Clone pets are every bit as safe as real pets . Plus they 're insured . If it 's so safe then why is it against the law to clone humans ? Because the human brain is too complicated to syncord . You remember the experiment they did ? That 's why it didn 't work . Now it 's illegal to even try . But with pets , it 's a totally proven technology . Your RePet Oliver will be exactly the same dog . He 'll know the tricks you taught him where the bones are buried - He won 't even know he 's a clone . And did I mention they 're insured . I don 't care about insurance . I care if I can trust my daughter with an animal with sharp teeth . We can make him smaller . With softer teeth . You can ? We can even color-coordinate him to match your decorating scheme . Sim-Pals , the best friend money can buy . Let me think about that . - who 's fun to be with . Treat your kids - Look , I might be back . You 'll be back . Your daughter will think you 're the best . - My sister has two and loves them . - Good . Come , let 's fix the collar . There you are . - It 's amazing how real this is . - I know . My daughter will be so excited . Come , let 's go home . You have called Hank Morgan . Hi , I 'm not here , so leave a message . Hank , it 's me again . What happened to you ? I waited at Kelly 's for half an hour . It 's now ... - ... five past 7 . - I 'm Sim-Pal Cindy . What 's your name ? I 'm heading home now . If you get this message - Let 's be friends . What 's your name ? Can 't you see I 'm talking ? Quiet . - head to my house with flowers and a good excuse , or Natalie will kill you . I can sing songs . Would you like to sing with me ? Excuse me , do you know how to turn this off ? My niece has one . Say , " Go to sleep , Cindy . " - Go to sleep , Cindy . - Would you like to sing ... Go to sleep . Thank you . Thanks for the ride . Good night . Clara , sweetie , honey . Oliver was very sick and he had to be put down . Clara , sweetie , honey . Oliver had to go to heaven . " Why , Daddy ? " Well , you see , because it 's because , uh ... Shit , Oliver ! Why 'd you have to die ? Oliver ? Natalie . One two , three ! That 's amazing . Look at this cake ! Oh , my God . Adam Gibson ? Who are you ? We have a situation . Come with us , please . What the hell is going on ? Cooperate and everything will be fine . Fine ? Someone 's in my house , eating my birthday cake and it 's not me ! We know . There 's been a 6th Day violation . A human was cloned . - That human was you . - We can help . - Then get him out ! - But you 'll have to come with us . I don 't know who the hell you people are ... - ... but I 'm going in my house . - Right . Oops . Cindy fell down . Get the doll . Not here . I 'm Sim-Pal Cindy . What 's your name ? I can play games . Shit . Wiley , no ! Hold your fire ! That way ! Go ! Vincent , go ! I have a boo-boo . Stop the car ! Stop the car ! Thanks for the suggestion ! Don 't even blink . Oh , God . Someone stole the minivan . No , they stole my Cadillac . Oh , no . Car chase . Cool . - Who are you ? - I was hired to kill you . That 's all I know . I 'm Sim-Pal Cindy . What 's your name ? Secure child-seat restraint . Let 's be friends . - Where is this guy ? - I 'm Sim-Pal Cindy . Let 's be friends . What 's your name ? Will you be my mommy ? I don 't want to be your mommy ! - Shut up ! - What ? Somebody do something about that doll ! I have a boo-boo . This is crazy . Why does anyone want to kill me ? He got home first . You saw him , he didn 't see you . You 're screwed . He 's going to live your boring life and never be the wiser . Your wife and kid see you two together , they 'll be killed . Goddamn it , Wiley ! Son of a bitch . Stupid ! Blow out his tires this time ! Shit ! That was spectacular . Son of a bitch . Hold my belt . Okay . You got me ? Little more . Get some people to look for this guy ! Pick up Wiley and Talia 's bodies and get them to the lab . I 'm Dr. Griffin Weir . Welcome to the new Weir Organ Transplant Facility . Thanks for visiting Replacement Technologies . Doctor , protesters claim that cloning human organs will lead to cloning whole humans . That 's not only illegal , we 're years from the technology to do it . A human was cloned over 10 years ago . And we know the outcome of that bizarre experiment . If you recall , the Supreme Court ordered the clone be destroyed and I think that was the humane thing to do . It led to laws against human cloning and set back the course of legitimate research by years . Mr. Drucker ! You gave - This is Dr. Weir 's night , okay ? Is it true you want to get the 6th Day laws repealed ? Dr. Weir is interested in medicine , not politics . Mr. Drucker , the protesters claim you run RePet at a loss to soften people up to human cloning . You know , we shouldn 't forget that not long ago there were almost no more fish left in the ocean and half the world 's population faced the threat of hunger . Cloning technology turned that around . Extremists won 't admit they 'd rather people went hungry than eat cloned fish , so they yell about human cloning . Do you think human cloning laws should be changed ? Suppose a 10-year-old boy is in the hospital , dying of liver cancer . Thanks to Dr. Weir 's work we can save that boy . In the next bed lies another 10-year-old boy whose parents love him just as much only he has an inoperable brain tumor . You cannot clone a brain . The only way to save him would be to clone the whole person . How do you tell that boy 's parents that we can save the first boy but the research that would have saved their son wasn 't done because of a law passed by frightened politicians a decade ago ? So , what does that mean ? Enjoy the party . - Looks like you needed rescuing . - Yes , I did . Thank you . Weir Clinic , stay away ! No research on DNA ! Weir Clinic , stay away ! No research on DNA ! Hey , boss ! Johnny . How 's my star quarterback ? I 'd say I felt like a million bucks , but I 'd hate to take a pay cut . Don 't remind me , all right ? That was one nasty hit you took last week . Be careful . We don 't want you getting killed . Katherine ? Are you all right ? I 'm just feeling like I don 't quite belong . But I 'm fine . Really . No , you 're not . Should I call Dr. Stevens ? No , no , no . I just overdid it , that 's all . I 'll get a car to take you home . Thank you . Mr. Speaker ? Thank you so much for coming . Champagne ? - That was quite a speech . - You heard that ? Sorry I got carried away . Your words meant a great deal to me . As it happens , I have a son with an inoperable tumor of the brain . Oh , my God . I 'm so sorry , sir . It must have been in my subconscious , knowing you were here . No , no , it 's all right . Gave me a lot to think about . It gave me a different view of the subject . Mr. Speaker could I offer you a glass of brandy in my office upstairs ? I was 50 when Billy was born . I didn 't know if I wanted another kid so late . But now I love him so damn much . If there were something we could do for Billy only it was highly illegal would you consider it ? Of course I would . That 's the same hypothetical - No , no . Don 't answer so fast . You 'd face a minimum sentence of 40 years if it ever came out . But he 'd be cured ? He 'd be exactly the same . Perfect health . Never even have to know . But if the secret came out with the law now he 'd be put to sleep like a rabid dog . He 'd be destroyed , like a horse with a broken leg . And if it never came out ? Or if the laws were changed one day ? Billy wouldn 't have anything to worry about . I beg you . Go to my house and pick up my wife and daughter . If I go there , they 'll kill them both . You made a different report an hour ago . No , I didn 't . According to this , you did . That must have been the clone . Look , I know it sounds crazy . I can hardly believe it myself . - Was your car stolen or not ? - Yes . - So you did report it ? - No , I took it . You stole your own car ? I 'm a court-appointed virtual attorney . You don 't have to answer . Is my client being charged with auto theft ? I didn 't steal it ! It 's mine ! He claims it was filed by his clone . I see . Loading virtual psychiatrist . Mr. Gibson , what seems to be the trouble ? Go through it now with him ? You 're avoiding talking about your parents . Imagine : Two turtles are walking through the desert - Shut up ! What ? - Are you going to help me or not ? - Of course we are . Medical alert transmitted . Awaiting data . Wait in here . I 'll come get you as soon as we have news . Clones . He saw himself at his house tonight . Which was our mistake , not his . Excuse me . He 's at precinct seven . Can you hurry Talia and Wiley along ? I 'll need them both . Goddamn it ! Son of a bitch ! Piece of shit Wiley . I 'm gonna kill him . Where is he ? He 's still cooking . Son of a bitch . I look like crap . Do you have any idea how much my hair treatments cost ? How much does Gibson know ? That he 's been cloned and we 'll kill anyone who sees them together . What 's that ? What ? Does Drucker know you 're talking about killing innocent people ? Relax . It 's just a threat . Of course , we 'd never actually do it . Try to have a good night . You do your hair . I 'll take Wiley and Vincent . I 've got to pierce my damn ears again . Officials blame the latest strike by major league players entering its 4th year and a lack of fan identification with teams in the Series for the dismal ratings . Shit . Oh , no . Now what ? It feels tight all across here where the tires ran over me . You were run over by two cars and your chest was crushed . Exactly . I mean , no wonder , right ? It 's in your mind . Completely crushed . As in dead . As in you have a totally new chest now . Then why is it hard to breathe ? Tell you what . Why don 't you just stay out here ? Relax . The fresh air will do you good . State and government officials in Washington , D.C are openly dismissive of the Microsoft proposal . This amounts to an attempt by Microsoft to buy a state of the Union . Nothing in our Constitution or history offers the remotest legal theory by which a corporation can , in effect , own a state . But if he goes off his medication , the paranoid delusions come back . Very sad . Because at other times , he seems almost rational . Gibson ! Gibson ! - You 're dead . - No . You 're dead . Try to stay dead this time . Hank , it 's me again . What happened to you ? I waited for half an hour at Kelly 's . It 's now five past 7 . I 'm heading home , okay ? He 's fine . He 's okay . He 's our associate . Gibson must have knocked him out . Knocked him out ? He looks dead to me , doc . No . Pulse is strong . He 'll be up and around in no time . We 'll get him to the hospital . Easy . Let us know if you find Gibson . Honey , I 'm home . Darling , where are you ? Hi , sugar . Hello , my love . Have you been working out ? - You look so good . - Thank you . I recorded your sports programs . Maybe we can watch them together . I 'd like that . Or should I just take this off now ? No . Hold your horses . Oh , Hank , I think it 's so sexy when you go right to the chair . I know you do . You 're gonna have to zip me up , sweetheart . Careful with the merchandise . Hold on , please ! - Have they been here ? - Who ? Hello , Adam . Would you like a beer ? I 'm sorry I missed the party , but all of a sudden it 's 11 : 00 and I wound up at Kelly 's . - You missed my party ? - Not on purpose . It was sort of weird . I feel terrible . I don 't know what happened . You feel terrible ? I lost my wife , my daughter and my life tonight . special dance . Hank , listen . I need your help . Not now , cupcake ! What going on ? I don 't understand . That 's a real gun . What , what 's going - ? Jesus ! What are you gonna do ? Kill my cat ? What the hell is going on ? If you weren 't at my party , then you didn 't see him . Who 's " him " ? Jesus H. Christ . I said get your dog cloned , not yourself . What are you going to do ? Take my life back . You 're going to kill him ? Why not ? He 's not real . Plus , there 's no law against it . You 're not serious . I 'm dead serious . But look at him . He looks just like you . Technically , this could be committing suicide . But he 's not me . He 's not even human . Wait a second . How do I know he 's not you and you 're not him ? Look at him . He 's even a shitty carpenter . - Let me see your chin . - My chin ? - You cut yourself shaving . - Here . Okay , it 's there . You 're you . I couldn 't do it . Over here . I have a little something for you . - Is Clara asleep ? - Yes , she is . He 's grabbing her ass . I like how cigars make you feel . Daddy ? What are you doing out here ? I had a bad dream . I 'll take you back to bed . Come on . - Fireman . - Fireman , right . Wait here . Cigar , sir ? I can 't wait . - How do you like it ? - This is so good . Want to try some ? No . Smoking 's illegal , and I 'm a mother - All right . Sweetheart , I 'm sorry about the RePet . It 's all right . Dad ? Did Oliver die ? Is he a RePet ? Why do you say that ? You locked him outside . I did ? Oh , I 'm so sorry . I haven 't been myself lately . All right . You go to sleep now . Close your eyes . When was the last time we did it in the back of the car ? We should smoke cigars more often . Mr. Gibson ? - Who are you ? - Millennium Security . Sorry to - You got any I.D. ? Of course . Sorry I was a little jumpy but we had a break-in earlier . We know . Your car was found in the river . They find the bastard that stole it ? Relax . He 's a friend of mine . Sorry about this . Nice ' do . He 's here to help me fix the garage . Heel ! Now what ? Go see . Sorry , but he 's a RePet . He was a good watchdog . Now he lets my car get stolen and barks . I hate clones . Well , we 'll keep an eye on your property . I 'll sleep better knowing you 're around . Try to have a good night . - Good night . - Take it easy . Hide . Stop it , Oliver . Stop it . Gee , you 're glitchy today . Come on . Good Oliver . That was a bad idea . - Let 's get out of here . - We can 't leave them with that thing . Those were the guys trying to kill me . It 's dangerous for Natalie and Clara if I hang around . Darling , you 're still awake . I wanted to wait up for you . Thank you . And I wanted to spend time with these flowers . It took me 17 generations to get this right . If you had told me , I could have - I know . Engineered it in half an hour . I 'm not in that much of a hurry , Griffin . Want to get a cup of tea , then go upstairs ? Yeah . That 's a good idea . Let 's do that . It 's okay . Stay calm . Stay very , very calm . What a night . That was the longest night in my life . Hello , Adam . I 'm a one-man Virtual Girl but if you insert the installation disk ... - What was that ? - Nothing . I felt fingers going for my zipper . That 's disgusting . That 's disgusting ? I had to look away when you and Natalie were - The ... You want a beer ? You saw the clone do something with Natalie . They did nothing . - That 's not what I would have done . - What would you have done ? I would have ... Nothing . Well , that 's what they did . You know ... nothing . Shit . In the goddamn minivan . In the minivan . You know what tobacco does to people . He smoked my stogie too ? The bastard . That son of a bitch . Son of a bitch smoked your stogie . She couldn 't tell it wasn 't me ? It didn 't look like it . I mean , she seemed happy . You have no idea what it felt like seeing her with him . I should have just killed him . It could have been worse . At least she 's not cheating on you . Don 't move ! Tripp ! I 'm not after you . Back away . Back away . Why did you do that ? Don 't do anything stupid , now . That 's as far as you go . Is that you , Hank ? Hank ! Hey , Adam . Is Hank sleeping on the floor again ? That 's so cute . On the sixth day , God created man . On the sixth day ... On the sixth day , God created man . God created man on the sixth day . Why did you kill my friend ? Hank Morgan was an abomination to God . He was a clone . He was no clone . The real Hank Morgan died this afternoon . I killed him . So I could so I could kill Drucker . Drucker isn 't dead . It would be all over the news . Open your eyes . Drucker 's a clone . Dr. Weir cloned Drucker . Dr. Weir cloned your friend . Dr. Weir cloned you . They found us . Shoot me in the head . - What - - We have people at Weir 's lab ! I know who they are . They scan my brain , they 'll be killed . Shoot me . God forgive me . Doesn 't anyone stay dead anymore ? Who are you people ? I.D. required . Use biometric reader to verify identification or the alarm will sound in 10 seconds . Ten ... - He shot my foot ! - ... nine eight ... seven ... - ... six ... five ... - Son of a bitch ! ... four ... three two ... one . Stand by . Systems accessed . Gibson ! Select destination . You 're gonna pay ! Those were brand-new boots ! Dad ? You 're coming to my recital , right ? Of course . I never miss your recitals . I love you . You 're the greatest , Dad . Unless her pseudomonas infection clears up I 'm afraid there 's nothing we can do . What about her DNA scan ? Came up with cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis ? Which is impossible , considering it 's a childhood disease and she would have been dead 30 years ago . We 're running the scan again . No , I 'll do it at the clinic . If you could give us a moment , please . Darling . Sweetheart . We 're having you transferred to my clinic . No . I 'd like to stay here . I can help you at the clinic . If you stay here , there 's nothing I can do . I know , dear . I 'll die . Yes . Katherine , please . Listen to me . Katherine died 5 years ago . The feelings I have aren 't mine . They 're hers . Katherine , listen . Don 't do this . I need you so much . I need you . I 'm not afraid , Griffin . I want to die . My time has already passed . My love . What am I to do without you ? What ? You just water my flowers okay ? Weir Clinic , stay away ! No research on DNA ! Weir Clinic , stay away ! No research on DNA ! Thanks for visiting Replacement Technologies . We 're in the business of life . Welcome to the new home of the Weir Organ Transplant Facility here at Replacement Technologies . Excuse me , sir . I 've got to check that . Sure . Help yourself . But you might want to use these . What 's in here ? Lower intestines for Dr. Weir . He 's doing a study on the flesh-eating virus . You can open it . Just try not to breathe . That 's okay . You 're cleared . Thanks . What about her DNA scan ? Came up with cystic fibrosis . Which is impossible considering it 's a childhood disease - dead 30 years ago . So we 're running a new scan . No , I 'll do it at the clinic . We 've had 5 extra years since you cloned me . I treasure that . - Katherine , please . - No . Please . I 'm not afraid . I want to die . My time has already passed . Can I help you ? No . I just dropped my pen . I 'm all thumbs today . Thank you . Will you cut that out ? It 's driving me crazy . Excuse me , but I nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts . It 's only psychological . Your neck doesn 't really hurt . You 'd know better about that ? Yes , he would . It was your old neck that got broken . This is your new neck . Get it ? - I got killed twice in two hours . - Knock it off . We 've all been killed . You know what really bothers me ? That I 've never even seen a white light . Never seen angels . Nothing . Give me a break . I have you logged in . What ? When ? Twenty minutes ago . You 've entered a restricted area . Son of a bitch has got my thumb . Deactivate Talia , put out a security alert and seal off Drucker 's office , now ! Let 's go ! Shit . Can I help you ? Yeah . You can stick your thumb on that . - Thank God . - What ? More fundamentalists ? No . Adam Gibson . We think he 's in the building . Why wasn 't he taken care of already ? There are four of you and one of him ! Two of him , but you see what I mean . He has a wife and kid , right ? Get them . We may need the leverage . It costs me $ 1.2 million each time I clone you people . Try to be worth the money . They 'll kill you for seeing this . They 're doing their best already . Where 's Dr. Weir ? His lab 's over there . Dr. Weir . I know about the intruder . Your office called . Everything 's under control . It 's not under control . You had me cloned . Yes . Well , you cloned the wrong man . How did you do it ? You had to have my - What do you call it ? Your syncording . We had it . Give it to me . I want my life back . Here . It 's your syncording . How did you get this ? - I haven 't been - - Here . The vision test . It didn 't test vision . It took your syncording . An exact picture of your mind . And it took sample of DNA . With those we can clone a person in 2 hours . We had you so we could act quickly when we were told you were killed . Told I was killed ? Please don 't drink and drive . Gibson family schedule . Clara 's recital at school . This is Michael Drucker 's . A syncording contains everything in a person 's memory and this is what Drucker saw and heard just before he died . You don 't become a rich man without making enemies so we back up his mind religiously . - You own the Roadrunners , right ? - Among other things . - You a fan ? - I 'm a fan of both those teams . I 'll have to get you some tickets . - Promise , right ? - Sure . I 'll do it right now . Sally , remind me to get Roadrunner tickets for Adam Gibson . He 's my pilot today . On the sixth day , God created man . I 'm about to get on my snowboard - Hey , he 's got a gun ! Shit . It 's a fundamentalist . He just shot them both . Call Marshall . You hear me ? Sally ? Oh , shit . No , you don 't have to - Sally ! Help ! An anti-cloning fundamentalist killed everyone on board . It should have been me . We thought it was you . Drucker even mentioned your name . So , we used your DNA and syncording to clone you . To resurrect him , we had to cover it up . Keep talking . We cloned everyone . We realized you switched places too late . Access denied . Invalid thumbprint . - They 're trying to kill me . - There are two Adam Gibsons . That 's proof humans are being cloned which makes you very dangerous to Drucker . - Accessing security . - Tell me why I 'm a threat . Drucker was killed 3 years ago . We cloned him then ... - ... and we cloned him yesterday . - So ? If that came out , he 'd be destroyed in every way . A clone has no rights . A clone can 't own anything . Drucker would lose all this because Drucker would be legally dead . Look at all the cameras you got in this place . You can 't find one guy ? There . There . We don 't need where he 's been . We need to find where he is . Let 's go . Hit the alarm . - What 's up ? - What area 's so sensitive we don 't allow cameras ? Drucker will do anything - Anything to destroy the evidence . And you 're the evidence . This is evidence too . Move ! Clear the way ! Let 's go . - I have to go to the bathroom . - Okay , Clara . Anyone else need to go ? Why do you think I 'm telling you ? Because I can do nothing to stop them . - There he is ! - Zone Six . Engineering . Move ! Clear the way ! Or what they 'll do to your family . My family ? Drucker has to kill one of you . If he can 't kill you , he 'll kill the other . They could get killed in the process . Get out ! Destination " Get out " not understood . Morgan Randall Elementary School ! I 'm very sorry , sir . Daddy ! She 's supposed to be up there now , right ? This is the ... That 's odd . I 'm gonna go check and make sure everything 's okay . - Excuse me . - Of course . Clara ? Oh , my God . Mommy ! Mommy , I 'm scared . I 'm here . I got you . Could you help us ? What are you doing ? This is the only thing keeping the dogs from tearing her apart . So be quiet and come with us . Let 's go ! - Daddy ! - Adam ! Natalie ! You have reached 911 emergency . - Your call is important to us . - I know . Your " yes " or " no " answers will help us in directing police services to assist you . - Are you reporting a felony ? - Yes . - Thank you for reporting a felony . - Come on . Is the felony in progress now ? Yes ! Thank you . Is there a danger of bodily harm to you or others ? Yes ! Are suspects or injured victims ... Forget about talking to the police . I tried that already . Who the hell are you ? I know this sounds insane , but I 'm Adam Gibson . We don 't have time for you to be shocked . They have Natalie and Clara . - I need your help to get my family . - They 're my family . That 's for sleeping with my wife in the damn minivan . Your report has been canceled at your request . Thanks for visiting Replacement Technologies . It 's him . I believe you have something of mine . No , I have everything of yours . I have the syncording that proves you 're a clone . I have everything of yours : Your family in the palm of my hand . - Shall we trade ? - You read my mind . Just the highlights . All right . I 'll bring the disk to the Double X Charter office at 10 : 00 tonight . Be there with my family . Did you have to hit me that hard ? I had to stop you from talking to the police . That 's a good one . That should do it . What are you doing ? Testing it . I don 't think you have enough aluminum . Are you kidding ? That 's the same amount I used in the Rain Forest War . You shouldn 't be talking . The mess you left trying to fix your garage ... - You saw me working in the garage ? - Saw you ? I nearly shot you . Let 's try it . - Cool . - Cool . You better be miles away when this goes off . I 'm worried about getting inside to find Natalie and Clara . I 'll take my chances getting out . Griffin . Here . - What are you doing ? - Yours . Yours . Griffin , what 's the matter ? My wife , Katherine , is dead . Oh , Jesus Christ . Griffin , I don 't know - I 'm so sorry . Don 't start with " sorry " with me . Don 't start ! Don 't start with " sorry " ! I know about the congenital defects you 've been imbedding into the clone DNA . There 's my wife , Johnny Phoenix and the others . But , Michael , why my wife ? Why ? You 're right , Griffin . It 's a security protocol I implemented . I knew you wouldn 't understand . What should I understand ? The only thing I understand is that you gave my wife cystic fibrosis ! Calm down . Someone made a mistake . This wasn 't meant to hurt her . It didn 't hurt her . It killed her . Suppose we clone a senator who agrees to support us , then doesn 't . Or Johnny Phoenix wants more money . Shorter life spans gives us leverage . What 's the point ? The point is , if they betray us they 're dead . If they stay on the team , we clone them again . Exactly what we 'll do with Katherine . I 'm sure she 's being cloned now . No , she 's not . - No . - She 's - Griffin , it was a mistake . If you 're concerned about her DNA , go through it yourself . Obviously there 's no charge for the cloning . No charge . Thank you very much . What you don 't understand is , she doesn 't want to be cloned . So , do it anyway . Do it anyway . I see . Let me explain something to you . I loved my wife very much . So much so , I promised I 'd never bring her back again . And I won 't . And if I can 't bring her back , I 'll never bring back anyone , ever . That 's how much I loved her . So , it 's over , it 's finished and I quit . Well , I can 't let you quit . I 've looked the other way too often . I 've justified too much , so I 'm finished . It 's over . - Know what I 'm going to do for you ? - What are you going to do for me ? I 'm going to give you the greatest gift you can imagine . - A gift ? - I 'm gonna save your life . I 'm gonna save Katherine 's life . I 'm gonna save our friendship . And I 'm gonna save your marriage . What are you talking about ? I 'm gonna kill you now and I 'm going to clone you using your latest syncording . Then I 'll clone Katherine using her last syncording . You understand ? Do you see what I 'm doing for you ? You 'll be together , neither of you will remember you promised not to clone her . Or that she even died . Obviously you won 't remember this conversation . You 're welcome . All right , now show me my family . Bastards . I knew it . Your syncording isn 't here . It was being flown by remote . Both of you , get back here now . Come on . This is a private pad . You can 't land that here . I 'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker . It 's my charter contract . Everything 's normal , Mr. Drucker , but we 'll stay alert . What time are you taking off ? Take off ? I didn 't order - Your pilot 's on his way to reception . Now you listen to me . Seal the building . Full security alert . Find this pilot . He is armed and dangerous . And get Wiley and some men up to my office now . Freeze the elevators . Shut down level 2 and 3 parking garages . - Zone 6 , engineering corridor . - There . Sector 3 . He 's headed right towards you , Dan . Turn around ! Don 't try it . Get people up the stairwell ! Teams 3 and 4 , close off on him ! Let 's go ! - He shot out a power box . - He 's trashing the whole system . We got him trapped . West stairwell between 13 and 14 . Let 's go ! Cover the stairwell doors ! Fire in front of him ! Okay ! You did pretty good ! Fooled us at the airport ! Managed to turn this place into shambles ! You 're the greatest , Dad ! Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you . And , of course , we do have your family ! All right . Go get him . Well , well . - Adam Gibson . - I wish I could say , " the one and only . " Looks like we both went back on our word . - You 'll find we have more in common - - Where 's my family ? Right to business . An admirable trait . There they are . All safe and sound . For the moment . Your syncording is not on him it 's not in his whisper craft . I knew you 'd double-cross me , so I gave it to my clone . Anything happens to me or my family the next time you see it will be at your murder trial . Dr. Weir didn 't tell you . Tell me what ? Adam , Adam , Adam . He 's not the clone . You are . Ask yourself something . You remember anything after being scanned by my bodyguard ? I need to check your vision . Place your chin here . Changing places with your friend ? Buddy , wake up . We 're here . Woodland Mall . The salesman at RePet thought it was odd you came in twice . Asked the same questions twice . Still can 't make up your mind , huh ? You lost a dog , right ? Let me see your chin . You cut yourself shaving . Your shaving cut ? Easily reproduced . So is the scar from your old war wound . I know who I am . I know you do . Talia ? How many times have you been cloned ? I 've lost count . There 's one way to tell . Show him . It 's the only way to track what generation a clone is . See ? Four dots means she 's been cloned four times . Come on . Let 's take a look at yours . Take a look in the mirror . Let 's find out if you are who you think you are . Just under your left eye . Kind of takes the fun out of being alive , doesn 't it ? So , you see your family isn 't really your family . They 're his . And you , my friend , are in exactly the same boat as all of us . If Adam Gibson gets that syncording to the authorities we 'll all be destroyed . If you really love your wife and kid you 'll tell me where Adam Gibson is . We 'll get my syncording back , we 'll get rid of him . You 'll tell me where Adam Gibson is . We 'll get my syncording back , we 'll get rid of him . They 'll never know you 're the clone . That , or lose them forever . Adam , I 'm not making this offer because I have to . I can get everything from your memories . The fact is , I 'd like you to understand you 'd be serving a higher purpose . In two years , three tops , I 'll control enough votes to get the laws changed . Then we won 't have to lose our best people . Our Mozarts our Martin Luther Kings . We will finally be able to conquer death . We will finally be able to conquer death . And who gets to decide who lives and who dies ? You ? You have a better idea ? Yeah . What about God ? You 're one of those . I suppose you think science is inherently evil . No , I don 't think science is inherently evil . But I think you are . If you believe God created man in His own image you believe He gave man power to understand evolution to exploit science , to manipulate the genetic code . To do exactly what I 'm doing . I 'm just taking over where God left off . If you really believe that , then you should clone yourself while you 're still alive . Why 's that ? So I can understand your unique perspective ? No . So you can go fuck yourself . Now you 'll tell us where you put Mr. Drucker 's syncording ! You won 't find it in my head . I told him to hide it so I wouldn 't know where it is . - We 'll see about that . - Yeah , we will . Let 's go . Get in here . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Fine ! Have it your way ! That didn 't hurt so bad . Asshole . Let 's go back a few minutes . Here 's Drucker 's syncording . There 's the other one . Keep this . If I 'm not back in an hour , you know what to do . Don 't worry . If anything happens to you or my family I 'm gonna destroy that son of a bitch . You got the location ? The airport . I was just there . He 'll be dead in 20 minutes . Let 's go . Betrayed by your own mind . Wait ! Wait ! What ? They staged that scene for us . The other one sat behind him so we couldn 't see him . The bastard faked his own syncording . One hid and this one avoided looking at him so he wouldn 't be in his memory . You mean the other one 's here too ? Yes , that 's correct . Now put out another alert . This one is the diversion ! He smashes the cameras , gets captured meanwhile , the other one strolls in and takes his wife and kid . Idiot ! Natalie , Clara . - Oh , my God . What 's going on ? - Daddy ? Don 't worry , sir . Get him up . I 'm scared , Dad . What 's going on ? - This isn 't because of the cigar ? - No . I 'll explain to you later . Don 't worry . He 's not going anywhere . We 'll get him . Wait . Talia , you go . You two stay here . Have them block all the exits . Henderson seal off the tank area , levels 6 and 7 . I 'm trying . Give me a minute . And get us some power up here . Don 't move . My daughter is right inside that door . I don 't want to expose her to any graphic violence . She already gets enough of that from the media . Put your weapons down . Nice and easy . Good . Now , when you go inside you say ... Have a nice flight , little girl . They 're friends of Daddy 's . All right , let 's go . We 'll have a little midnight flight with Daddy and Mommy . There we are . All right ? There you go , sir . Wiley . Go . Wiley , just wait one second . Not again . And don 't bring him back . Stupid bastard blew a hole through my stomach . God . I 'll be dead in 20 minutes , tops . But what better place , right ? Henderson ? Where 's my power ? Coming on-line now , sir . Get all exits blocked . All exits ! Shit . Go start warming up a blank . Do a fresh syncording . I want my mind up-to-the-minute . Here it is . This is a fresh one . This will be a complete syncording . Is that Talia ? Go help her . We 'll find them . - What have you got ? - Tanks 3 and 4 , nothing . Okay , go . Take the back walk . No . Oh , God . Oh , no . Take her to your mother 's and stay there until I come . Come with us , Daddy . I have to help a friend , okay ? Bye . I love you . Wiley , you shot me ! Oh , right . That was you . I 've got to get dressed . You 're not even going to wait until I die ? Would you ? Come on . Get it off . You got blood on the jacket . Jesus Christ . What ? What ? What ? Look we can make a deal . I didn 't do anything to you . It was all him . Listen to me . I can rebuild all this in a very short time . I can still save you , Adam . Save me ? We put defects in the clone DNA to give them short life spans . Want to know what you 'll die of ? How long you 've got to live ? We can go right upstairs and look it up . We all have to die someday . We don 't have to die . I 'm offering you the chance to live forever . Never aging . Perfect in every way . Perfect ? Like you ? Look . Here is your " perfection . " Oh , God . There 's no need to panic . I can fix this . You won 't fix anything . It 's over . It 's finished . It 's finished . When I said you should screw yourself I didn 't mean for you to take it literally . Go after him . Get him . Check the roof ! You ! Up top ! Come on ! - Can you fly this ? - Better than you can . Good . Because your shooting sucks . Let 's get out of here . Shit . Come on ! Try to climb over me ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Come on ! Shit ! You know , I keep wondering am I really human ? Do I have a soul ? Well , your DNA scan came back normal , didn 't it ? Yeah . Zero defects . Just like a RePet commercial . If you 're not human , they would have mentioned it . All right , enough philosophy . I better get going . I 've got 3 weeks at sea to figure it out . Hurry if you want to see Clara . Thanks for letting me say goodbye to your family . Now , wait . This is your family too . You were willing to die to save them . Think about that while you 're at sea wondering if you 're really human or not . Because if that 's not being human I don 't know what is . Thanks . Hello , everybody . - Look what I brought . - A kitty ! Oh , Sadie . I thought that Hank 's cat was a - She is . But you hate RePets . Well , I changed my mind . You old softie . Can we keep her ? - Please ? - Of course . That 's why I brought her home . Put her down . Good . Thank you so much .

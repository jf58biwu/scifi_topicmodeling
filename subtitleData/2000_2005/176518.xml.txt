 Joe . Joe , if you 're there , pick up , okay ? I need you to go out and see if that body 's still there . Be careful , all right ? Don 't touch it . Where are you man ? Been up to the gravesite yet ? But call okay ? Call me as soon as you get this . Hey , Jill , it 's me . I just wanted to call you . How ... uh ... I love you . I just wanted to call and say that . Hey Jill , it 's me . Uh , I really need to talk to you . If you haven 't figured it out by now ... Shit , I can explain . I really fucked up this time . Really ... I really fucked up this time . Call me . Okay Sandstrom , get your shit together . You 're going to go back to the lab and tell them what 's going on . Caroline . Call Caroline . Excuse me , can I help you ? Please , sit down . I 'll get someone right away . Hello ? That is so disturbing ! Who is that ? - Off . My daughter , Lilith . - Shit ! Well , no wonder I am so fucked up . What are you doing here ? Oh , that 's a really nice welcome . I guess you were too busy to come pick me up . You didn 't tell me you were coming . - Yes , I did . - When ? I ... - Hi , Sally . - Oh , Jesus . Uh , Twyla . Yeah . How long ago ? Okay , are you there now ? Carlos , yeah , I want him there too . Okay , you call him . I 'm on my way . - Where you going ? - Huh ? Oh , airport . Oh , what ? To pick someone up ? No , I gotta go to work . David , I mean ... she just ... got ... Oh yeah , yeah , listen . You two get to know each other and I 'll be back ... later . Bye . I hate helicopters . I hate riding with people who hate helicopters . Tower , I 've got the NorBAC scientist on board . Caroline should be waiting for us at the airport . - How was the trip ? - Let 's not get into it . What do you got ? All the victims seems to be North of here . Okay . No one 's recovered , 3 dead . Original diagnosis was some kind of pox . But ? Winnipeg came back negative for any of the pox viruses that affect humans . - What about Atlanta ? - They I.D. ' d it as camel pox . - Human beings don 't get camel pox . - They do now . They tried treating it with the drug cidofovir . It works on the virus in camels . No effect on the victims and they can 't figure out why . Has anyone been outside of Canada to the Middle East ? - Or a zoo maybe ? - The latest victim hasn 't been anywhere . Okay , so we 've got a virus that shouldn 't infect people , but does , and a cure that should work , but doesn 't . - What 's causing it or how it 's spread . - Other than that ... Patient 4 : Darryl Graves , 16 , student . Works part-time at a gas station on highway 17 . Left work yesterday around 6 with a fever . Brought himself here last night at 11 : 30 covered in pox . - Okay , I got it . It moves fast . - How about the others ? - All died within 36 hours . - Connect this guy to the other 3 victims . There were all connected . Not this boy . Excuse me , could you turn him to the side please . Oh , Jesus . Carlos ! I have to call the CDC . What do I tell them ? Whatever you want . Let 's get those samples from pathology . - When did you and my dad hook up ? - About 3 months ago . That 's a really long time for him . - Sally is this Jell-O or an experiment ? - My name 's Twyla . And it 's aspic . Um , so where do you live anyway ? Far . Manhattan . Right . You know , actually I live on Salt Spring Island , near Vancouver . - Cool . - No . The adults are all old hippies and the kids are all skater losers . So , what ? Did my dad pick you up in a bar or his health club ... ? - We met professionally . - Oh , you 're a molecular biologist . I 'm his physiotherapist . So that was therapy then ? Let 's treat is as a Bio-3 until we know what we 're dealing with , all right ? Sure . - Uh , Dr. Sandstrom ? - Maybe . Can I speak to you about something ? Speak . - Uh , I sent you an email . - And I get hundreds a day kid . - I don 't read half of them . - Listen . - I need your help . - Because ? - Because I 'm dying . - I 'm sorry . - Please help me . - Kid , I 'm a molecular biologist . I know all about you . You 're the best genetic scientist in the country . Look , I 'm dying ' cause I 'm a clone . - Say again . - Like Dolly . - She died ' cause she was a clone . - Dolly died because she was euthanized . She had a lung problem . And she was a clone , - and you 're not . - I am ! Look ! Just look at this picture of me and my brother . Amazing . Two brothers who look alike . You do need help kid . I 'm not that kind of doctor . Dr. Sandstrom , sir , please just ... - I 'll get started . - Right . - Bob . - From Oxford . Oh yeah , Cort says the colamine is NAH Lab . He knows about a new strain of monkey pox . - Okay , what about that flu sequencing . - Oh , I just broke down the French strain . - No one 's answering at UCB or Stanford yet . - Wake ' em up . Anything ? - Closer to West Nile than Spanish . - Shit . Look up this drug , I want every report you can find on it . The results are on your desk . Perfect . I want you on this , okay ? You do the sequencing while Carlos does the pathology . Lil , Air Canada 3551 , 10 : 34 P.M. Fuck . - The other side . - Cidofovir . Oh yeah . - And uh ... , Twyla called . - Yes . Did you know that camel pox is the closest virus to small pox ? - Maybe that 's why people are getting it . - That or too much humping . You know that 's where IUD came from . Camel drivers used to insert pebbles into the uteruses of camels to keep them from getting pregnant . How 'd they figure that out ? It 's going to be a long day . Carlos , people with Asperger 's Syndrome can 't help it . You know , the Iraqis are working on strains that infected people . - Does David know this ? - I don 't know . - This is camel pox . Patient 4 . - Identical . Except that boy has a hemorrhagic fever . The Lassa or Marburg , probably both . Serrano , poxes look like bricks . Hemorrhagics look like worms . - Do these bricks look like worms to you ? - No , but they 're acting like worms . I was in Africa with Medecins Sans Frontieres . That pool of blood . With Ebola you leak blood out of every orifice . - Poxes cause internal bleeding too . - This wasn 't bleeding , it was a complete vascular meltdown . If you open that boy up , his organs will look like they 've been put through a blender . Ebola ? This meant his liver and kidney 's leaking out of him and that would explain the failure of cidofovir . - Ebola and camel pox together ? - Maybe a genetic hybrid of the two . No , camel pox is made of DNA , Ebola 's made of RNA . The two split and went their separate ways over 2 billion years ago . - Maybe they 've kissed and made up . - A variant ? No , or maybe it 's not Ebola and maybe it 's not even camel pox . Okay , where do we start ? The minister of health wants you to phone her and so does the CDC . - The rest are just urgent . - Thanks , Wes . Patient 4 , the Grave 's boy , his mother was just admitted to the hospital covered in pox . Okay . Credit card receipts from the gas station where he worked , surveillance tape from the garage . I 'll run a trace on all the cars and quarantine the occupants . Go wider . Include anyone they were in contact with . Hey , so this is what we know so far . Victim 1 : Elmer Jones . Owns a grocery store off highway 17 . Lives alone . Tuesday morning he feels sick , goes to C.U. , Dr. William Parton . Dr. Parton sends Elmer to Northway Health Centre here , admitting nurse is Katherine Holochuck . Now those are victims 1-2 and 3 . A straight flow of events ... until Darryl . 150 clicks away . All of these people are in quarantine now ? Except the question marks , we 're still searching for them . Now what we have to know is why did it suddenly jump to Darryl . Does this mean one of these people infected someone who drove down the highway and gave it to Darryl ? And or is there is one person , a patient zero , who 's spreading it ? Caroline . Patient 4 , Darryl , he just died . You 're talking about nature somehow accidentally combining , - say , a flea and an elephant . - I 'm not saying it makes sense , just it makes more sense than anything else I 've heard . Okay , how about this ? A single strand RNA Ebola-like intermediate somehow might get copied on a cellular reverse transcriptase and then integrated into the genome . Okay ? - Okay , but what if- - - Okay , just a second . Now , camel pox , it might somehow super infect the same cell , and then some kind of recombination occurs . I mean , I know we 're talking about nuclear and cytoplasmic replication , but hey , you never know , right ? No . David , you know there 's no way that the camel pox variant could accommodate the extra genomic burden you 're giving it . There 's no way . Ockham 's Razor . The simplest explanation is best . Fuck . - I need more coffee . - You want one ? I 've got to call my daughter . You 're a father ? Sort of . - David . - Oh hey , come on in . I got a lead on a sample of the Spanish lady . - From where ? - It 's a long story . Have you guys made any progress ? Eliminated a few hypothesis , you ? Positive on CP , negative on Ebola . We 've PCR 'ed the hell out of it , David . I don 't think there 's any Ebola there . I think Carlos is wrong . Yeah , maybe . Okay , call me tonight . Okay , bye . I didn 't know you smoke . I don 't . Neither do I. I would think an MD would know better . I do , I do . I 'm quitting . Again . So , how do you like it here ? Ah , I miss Mexico City a little . The sushi was better . Any regrets ? If I want to do the best , I have to be with the best . You didn 't answer my question . I have no regrets working with David Sandstrom . Someone has to teach him how to do things . So , how are we doing in there ? Well , I have my theory , David has his . Eventually , you run out of wrongs , you end up right . - I hope eventually is soon , Carlos . - Yeah . - Mierda . See you inside . - Yeah . We 've gone through it twice now . We definitely have PCR evidence for camel pox DNA , but no evidence at all for any Ebola . What about other hemorrhagic fever viruses ? - Nothing . - When you were at Fort Egan , - did you ever see anything like this ? - Never . Isn 't it time we give up on this idea ? We 're getting nowhere . We have no material evidence . We have no theoretical model . What ? Oh hey , Twyla , can I call you back later ? I don 't know . Actually that was a good answer . Here 's a better one . - What ? - Look at this . ... cell align with the pox variant components , and then we take the Ebola virus ... packaging sequences ... and we 'll super infect ... okay ... divide ... pox ... Where did that come from ? I don 't know , it just kind of popped into my head . - Virus ! It 's a virus . - Too crazy ? Yeah ... well . - Hira ? - Possible . Simple enough ? Maybe too simple . Thank you . Let 's do it . - What ? - Sorry , it 's mine . So , what ? Are you guys like broken up or ... ? I don 't know , your father isn 't really equipped to deal with that kind of conversation . Yeah , I know . So , what ? Are you leaving ? Yeah , well , I don 't want to get too comfortable . Why not ? - You don 't know him at all , do you ? - Oh yeah , I know him . David has room for 2 things in his life : His science and himself . The rest is just shit that gets in the way or gets used and thrown out . That 's your dad , honey . So , once you figure out where you fit , you do what you got to do , right ? Ciao . Goodbye , Twyla . It 's Sally . - What 's wrong ? - It 's not working . - Not even my card . - Maybe your face is changing . I mean those face recognition things are very sensitive . - Can you try ? - Sure . So , either quarantine the school or I 'll get somebody to quarantine the whole town . Three countries came together to back this lab but you can 't get one school closed . Shit . It 's Caroline Morrison at NorBAC . I need the medical officer of health 's daily briefing . It was supposed to be sent to me . I 'm not interested in excuses , just do it please . Thank you . He touched her . I 'm going to put him on the list . - I wasn 't sure you 'd still be here . - I was just leaving . - Anything ? - A couple of leads I want to check out . Oh , so where are we at ? That boy we saw , Darryl , his mother just died . So , that 's seven dead , four in critical condition , and so many in quarantine I can 't keep up . Two-hundred and fourteen . What do you have ? We had a theory . Unfortunately , we 're having a lot of difficulty proving it . Oh , and that Face First thingie you put in ? It 's not working . What 's wrong with it ? I don 't know . Hira had a problem with it today . We 're having trouble getting her through a background check . - She was cleared 3 months ago . - Yeah , well something 's come up . Okay , would you please check with me before you start playing around- - David , not now . I 'm juggling politicians , health authorities and police departments . And I 'm juggling camel pox , Ebola and God knows what else and I 'd like to have my best virologist able to get into lock up . She 's here , she 's just on limited access . What do you want ? Hello , like , I asked you a question . Uh , I 'm Mick . What ? What , are you retarded ? I asked you what you wanted . Are you Dr. David Sandstrom 's daughter ? No . Yes , maybe I am Dr. David Sandstrom 's daughter . Why ? What do you want ? I need to talk to him . - So talk to him . - I 've tried . I need help . Look , I 'm dying . So is everyone . If no one died there wouldn 't really be enough room , you know ? - Yeah , well , I 'm dying now . - Oh , like now now . Like if I don 't get help I won 't make it till the end of the year . I really need your dad 's help . Look , my dad 's not even a doctor doctor . He 's a PhD doctor and they don 't help anyone . I know but he 'll know how to help me because ... - Yeah ? - I 'm a clone . You actually almost had me there for a second . Damn it , I 'm a clone , I can prove it ! Look , you 've got issues , okay ? - Who are you not talking to ? - Ersky Labs in South Africa . Why ? They have the most state of the art automated DNA sequencer in Africa . Hemorrhagics come from Africa . I 'm wondering if they 've ever seen anything like this . Clever . Hey ! What 's going on with my security clearance ? Oh , don 't worry about it . It 's just bureaucratic bullshit , but if you run into any more bumps , you let me know , okay ? It almost becomes a Ebola / camel pox chimera . - Serrano , no personal calls . - Deiderman of Heidelberg . Microbiology 's worst squash player . - Who are you talking to , Bob ? - My mother . - Does she have any ideas ? - Huh ? Says your proposed chimera virus is too unstable , it would never survive repeated passage through people . Deiderman , yeah , Sandstrom . Nothing wrong with being wrong , right ? - Yeah , you 'll get used to it . - He 's right , David . No way to fit the Ebola gene only to the pox variant . - It 's true , it 's in there . - Maybe not the way we 're imagining it . - What fucking way ? - I don 't know . I don 't even know what we 're arguing about . Chimera , Ebola , camel pox together . But Hira can 't confirm it with PCR . What if this isn 't Ebola ? I 'd like to base this on something more reliable than Carlos ' notes . Mayko 's right , David . I ran an analysis test on the serum , couldn 't find any traces of Ebola antibodies . There are no IGM or IGG antibodies , and the immuno-chemistry tests came up negative . Then what are we saying ? We 're saying it was a brilliant hypothesis , but my diagnosis was wrong . No . Carlos is right . It 's Ebola . It 's there . - Yeah . - How 's it going ? - Oh , fucking beautiful . You ? - Two more dead . - Shit , where are you ? - A restaurant in McClint . - So , it 's on its way eh ? - Yeah . And I have politicians in denial with health care professionals on the verge of panic . - What about your end ? - Uh , dead end . I can get you first samples in a few hours . Will that help ? Maybe . The damn virus has evolved so fast . A mutation might shed some light . Bye . Okay , everybody , go home , have a shower , feed your dog , change your underwear , be back in an hour . We 've got fresh samples coming in . I can get you first samples in a few hours . Thank you . Well , the couple closed the diner at 9 . They were just making their own suppers . Steaks left on the grill started a grease fire . I was supposed to meet the local chief medical officer . - Well , she 's on her way . - She had to go by the hospital and check on how they 're setting up the quarantine . NorBAC ? - Excuse me . - Yeah , what ? - This thing , what is it ? - That 's what we 're working on officer . I want this place sealed up . No press , no pictures . - My son 's in quarantine . - Why ? - Same school as Gerald Graves . - It 's just a precaution . Well , it 's one hell of a precaution . My wife 's scared to death . - I understand . - What do I tell her ? - Is my boy going to be all right ? - We don 't know enough about this yet . - I 'm sorry , but that 's the truth . - Word is that Gerald died . Is that true ? Yeah . Look , I appreciate your time . I 'll get to sealing this place up . Officer ... Got a card ? Yeah . - As soon as we know anything . - Thank you . Lilith ! Lilith ! Hello ? - You abandoned me . - It had nothing to do with you . Your mom and I weren 't getting along and she 's the one who moved out too , so if you 've got abandonment issues , take it up with her . Retard , I mean yesterday . - Oh . Uh , Twyla was here . - Oh , right , right . You seriously must be the worst father in the world . I come and what ? Within 10 seconds you 're gone , and 24 hours later you 're back . Where were you ? I was working on something very , very important . Oh , and I 'm not . - I need a beer . - Yeah , me too . The fact is it 's moving down highway 17 . Well , shutting down a highway 's a good precaution considering the consequences . That 's nothing compared to what happens if this virus hits Toronto . You sir , can hope for the best , but my job is to plan for the worst . The sooner you get back to me , the better . - Your mom got your email . - Was she pissed ? Did you want her to be ? And you were right , I was supposed to pick you up at the airport . I fucked up . I 'm sorry . You can stay till the weekend and then you 've got to go . - No , I 'm moving in . - No . What ? - No ... look , there 's a virus ... - Newsflash . Biology isn 't everything . And I hate to break it to you but you are my parent too . Yeah , but the one thing that we both agree on is that I suck as a dad , and that 's genetics . Oh yeah , when I went to the store today I got stalked . - What ? - Yes , this guy ... I don 't know , this kid , he was like totally following me . And then I got up in his face- - - What did he want ? - You . Said he was dying and needed to talk to you . - Is he a weird guy about 15 ? - Well , all 15 year old guys are weird . Well , they don 't get any better until they 're about 30 . - Did he say he was a clone ? - Yeah , and then ... - I mean , that 's not possible , is it ? - Not unless he 's from the future . Exactly what I thought . Morrison . I wouldn 't use the word epidemic . There are some reported cases of what appears to be a virus , yes . A pox virus . Don 't know . Some fatalities , yes . Nine . Look , I 'm trying to be as straightforward as I can , but I will not tell you anything that is not confirmed . The only thing certain is 9 dead . How many more ? I don 't know . Jesus . - So , explain this whole virus thing . - It 's very scary . What do you remember me telling you about viruses ? - Uh , dick all I guess . - Okay , virology 101 . Viruses are very small . They 're about a millionth of an inch . If this room was a cell , a virus would be the size of a pinprick , okay . And what they do ... what they do is they crawl in through tiny , tiny holes . Say , right about there . - Okay . Uh , can you pass the chocolate ? - Uh , sure . So , they crawl in , okay , and they steal some enzymes and they use them to make copies of themselves . Thousands of copies . And with Ebola , which is what we call a hemorrhagic or bleeding virus , eventually all those copies bust out . They blow about a thousand holes through your cell walls , and then they float away and each of them finds another cell to crawl into and make another thousand copies of itself , and a thousand thousand more holes and then pretty soon you 're bleeding and leaking to death inside your own skin . Yeesh . And that 's what we 're dealing with here , and that is why you really , really have to go home to B.C. Dad , I would rather die of a virus than of boredom in Salt Spring . I 've got to go back to work . Dad , it 's just that mum is dating this like totally boring base player guy who wears way too much cologne and ... like , he calls me Lily . - So sorry . Does he make your mom happy ? - Well , yeah , I suppose he ... It doesn 't make itself . This doesn 't make itself . Jesus , that 's it . You are brilliant ! - What ? What ? - Fucking brilliant ! You aren 't seriously going to work right now . Yeah , want to come ? - Not at 3 a.m. - Okay . Thanks for the chat . Excuse me . - Do you work here ? - I do . Hi , I 'm Bob Melnikov . - Hey , are you in charge ? - Of the lab ? No . I 'm a biochemist . David Sandstrom is the chief scientist . - I thought Caroline Morrison was . - Oh no , she 's not a scientist , she 's the executive director of the lab . The liaison to- - The 3 countries involved in NorBAC : Canada , the U.S. and Mexico , right ? - Are you a reporter ? - Yeah . So , what 's going on up north , Bob ? Are we looking at another SARS outbreak ? - I can 't ... I don 't ... - Come on . - Nice to meet you . - Hey ! Did you see the report on Angus MacDonald ? - The mechanic . - The garage on highway 17 . Yeah . He died before they could question him . His wife is sick now , she doesn 't work there . I 've got a crew going through all the receipts . Someone 's on that highway . If they went to another garage , they 're probably having car trouble . - Let 's check out every garage on 17 . - I 'm on it . Okay , hypothesis # 2 : We can 't find any genetic information that will prove the Ebola gene is in the camel pox genome . Why ? Because we are dealing with a chemically synthesized gene . Ebola kills , right ? But it doesn 't spread very easily . Camel pox spreads easily , but it can be fought with a drug . So , if you could connect them , Ebola DNA would get a free ride on the camel pox . - But they 're incompatible . Why ? - Square pegs , round holes . Right . So you have to remake the connections , and I 'm telling you there 's somebody out there who 's figured out how to do this . - Now they fit . - What do you got ? - A super virus . - Are you saying this thing is deliberate ? You know , well nothing else makes any sense . I mean if creating a killing machine makes any fucking sense . And I think I know how they did it too . Amino acids , building blocks of proteins . Proteins , building blocks of viruses . So , if you 're looking for the Ebola , you want to look for its DNA recipe , but we can 't find it . Why ? Because the same amino acid can be coded ... - with different DNA . - Wait , wait , wait . You lost me . Okay , think of it this way . - What does that say ? - Grate aural sects . - Thank you , David . - You 're welcome . So whoever made this knew that we 'd be looking for this . So they wrote it like that . Okay folks . Now we know what we 're looking for . Jesus Christ . Hey kid , come here ! All right , listen . Now you stop harassing me , you stop harassing my daughter or I swear to God I 'll have you put away . Do you understand ? Hmm ? Have a nice day . Dr. Sandstrom , would you talk to my father ? - Oh , Jesus . - I think you know him . Dr. Shelby Sloane . - Shelby Sloane 's your father ? - He 's the man who cloned me . - Then why doesn 't he fix you ? - ' Cause he 's given up . - No , it 's because you 're not a clone ! - I am ! Please , just let me prove it to you ! All right , I want you to get me DNA samples of you and whoever or whatever you were cloned from . I 'll run them through my mass clonometer . If the samples match up I 'll call the National Post , they 'll make you clone of the year , okay ? It 's been a real out of this world conversation , Mick . Do you know why my father stopped being a scientist ? - Oh God . - Because of what he did to me . Let me give this to you straight , all right ? You say you 're dying but there 's people out there right now who really are dying . So why don 't you just get your- - Kid , take it easy . All right ? Get me the samples . Really ? Really . But I mean it . You stay away from my daughter . Ladies and gentlemen , this , believe it or not , is an artificial gene . - Scary . - Bio terrorism , yeah . I know , how the hell did you figure this out so fast ? - David , are you sure ? - Uh-hmm , and it 's coming right at us . Wes , Homeland Security , FBI , CSIS , and send through the Investigation Securidad . This is so fucked . Scientists , all that knowledge , twisting it around - just to kill innocent people . - I can 't believe it . Gas chambers , germ warfare , atomic bombs . I can . David , what about a cure ? With Ebola there 's no vaccine , no cure , just quarantine . Caroline Morrison at NorBAC . Please tell him it 's urgent . When it hits the city , it spreads everywhere . There 'll be no way to stop it . The dead will be the lucky ones . Why don 't you come and sit down while we wait for the bus . - Oh , thank you . - Oh here , let me help with your luggage . Oh ! Great . I was just coming to sit . It sounds like someone 's overtired . Yeah , and a sore throat . - Oh , what 's her name ? - Miranda . - Oh , Miranda . - Yeah . - That 's such a lovely name . - My truck broke down so I got a little more luggage than I can handle . - Oh well , so do I. - Oh . Oh , so where you off to ? Oh , the U.K. so Miranda can meet her dad . I came back to Canada to have her . And what 's his problem ? Wasn 't he there at the conception ? - Well , he 's a great guy . - Oh . Oh hey , the bus is here . - Here , let me help you with this . - Oh , you don 't mind ? Oh , thank you . - No , no , no . What 's your name ? - Daisy . - I 'm Frances . - Hi , Frances . Thanks a lot . - Here , I 'll let you go first . - Thank you . Well , Frances , it looks like we 'll almost there . Frances ? Frances . Hey ! Hey ! You have to be very cautious when throwing around terms like epidemic . But it has the potential to be one ? Anytime you have a virulent , unidentified agent , there is of course a potential for an epidemic , provided- - Just tell the truth , God damn it . And say what ? That we 've got a manmade virus out there heading right at us ? You do that , you 'll have chaos . - There 's no risk to the general population . - Just as long as you wash your hands . We can 't stress enough the importance of thoroughly washing your hands . They have no idea what 's coming at them . Yes , but what 's the difference between a medical emergency and an epidemic ? Cynical reporter : 1 , earnest health official : 0 . If you need me , I 'll be back at the lab . Second , there is no epidemic . - I got what you need . - You don 't go away , do you ? Look , I 've got it right here . Kid , what I need you couldn 't fit in that little brown bag . You know what ? I 'm beginning to think you are a clone . You came from a fucking mule . - Look ! Look at these ! - Whatever that is , I don 't want it . Baby teeth . One of mine , one of my brother Cal 's . They still got blood on them . You said if I got you samples you 'd test them . You said ! Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I know but see , those could both be your teeth . I 'd need the complete sets . Sorry . - You promised . - Don 't do that , understand ? Jesus . Yeah . Where ? Oh shit . Did you call Carlos already ? Okay , I 'm on my way . Jesus ! Would you get the fuck out of here ! My mother died 2 years before I was born , Dr. Sandstrom . Does that make any sense to you ? Promise you 'll look into it . - Yeah , now get up . - Promise . Promise . Thank you , Dr. Sandstrom . So , you 'll call me then ? Oh yeah , I 'll put you on my speed dial . My number 's right there on the bag . - Goodbye , Mick . - Goodbye . Thank you , sir . Uh , Dr. Sloane ... this is David Sandstrom calling . Uh , it 's about your son ... about some kid who claims to be your son . I think we 've got a problem here . Could you call me on my cell ? Yes , but what 's the difference between a medical emergency and an epidemic ? Cynical reporter : 1 , earnest health official : 0 . If you need me , I 'll be back at the lab . Second , there is no epidemic . - Morrison . - Caroline ? Another call , on a bus just outside the city limits . Oh shit . We have the bus sealed . It 's heading towards the quarantine facility near the airport . Okay , I 'm on my way . Call David and Carlos , tell them to meet me there . Got it . Caroline took me to her office , asked me all kindsof questions about Hira , her family , her brothers . - What did you say ? - Nothing . Well , I did say she wears nice perfume : Hints of saffron and cinnamon . At least that 's what I detected . We have another case . It could be a busload . Quarantined at the airport . So , it 's here . All right , I 'll be back with samples . Somebody track down Hira , we 're going to need her on this . What 's going on here ? Why are we being kept on this bus ? Sit down , be quiet and put your mask on . No one told us anything . It 's nothing to worry about . You 're being put in quarantine . All right , thank you Mr. Zaltsberg . Dear , how much longer do I have to stay here ? The nurse will explain everything . This is a nurse ? Are you in charge here , ' cause I 've got to be on a plane . Sit down please . I 'll explain everything . Daisy , my name is Caroline Morrison , I 'm with NorBAC . Which is what ? The North American Biotechnology Advisory Commission . So , what they 're saying about some kind of virus ... - It 's what Frances has ? - We think so . Well , what is it ? I mean ... could we get it ? Daisy , listen to me . We 're not sure how it 's spreading . We 're not even sure what it is . Well , I 'm fine . I mean , we 're both fine . I have to be in England . Of course but we need you to answer a few questions : Where you travelled from , people you might have met along the way . Fine . Did you happen to stop for gas near Bear River ? - Yeah . - Where 's your car ? Pick up . It gave up on me so I traded it in for a ride to the bus . With Angus . Angus 's garage near Soren ? Uh , I 'd take you to Toronto , but I 'm the only one here . No , don 't worry . It 's okay , really . The bus station will be just fine . I 'm sure it 'll get us there on time . Yeah . How did you know ? It 's a long ride . Where are you travelling from ? My parents . Heron Bay , near Marathon . Okay . Okay ? Does that mean I can go now ? It 's going to be a little longer . Her neighbour was with her yesterday . Said that she was perfectly fine . - How 's the neighbour ? - No symptoms . Okay , so probably not airborne transmission . It could be a respiratory secretion . A cough or a sneeze , but it would have be directed right at the n ... Next victim ? My mom 's a midwife , she was freaking , right . Like nobody 's ever had a baby in Africa before . You were in Africa ? Yeah , I worked at an AIDS hospice . Yeah , I was really sick , like sick-sick , and William was travelling all the time so he thought it 'd be best if I came home to have Miranda . - William ? - My fiancé . - Where is William now ? - In London . He just rented us an apartment . Oh , excuse me . A flat . Hah ! - He 's British ? - Very . He holds his little finger up when he drinks his tea . - Would you like me to set up a call ? - Yeah . Yeah , call him . William Zanzinger . His number 's in my wallet . You guys have that . - Okay . - I 've been trying to call him all day . Hold on . Okay , the new woman Frances who was just brought in , we can 't find an intersection between her and the other victims , but the girl she was sitting next to , the one you 're looking at , had contact with just about everyone who 's gotten sick . What about the baby ? It says here she has a throat infection . Temperature , swollen glands , that 's it ? Anything else ? I think we should take a closer look , take some throat cultures , see what we come up with . We 've been through her things . No aerosol spray , no powder no anything she could have used to spread the virus . Well , it wouldn 't make much sense for her to deliberately spread the virus , unless she was immune to it . Well , all I know is she was sitting right next to that woman and look at her . She could have a natural immunity . David , what do think ? Morrison . Yeah . When did they find them ? Her parents were just found dead . - Well that ain 't natural . Oh . - David , what ? What if there 's nothing natural about it ? I mean , some son of a bitch has figured out a way to manufacture a Camelpox / Ebola virus . Who 's to say that same son of a bitch couldn 't manufacture an immunity ? Look , DNA samples from the mother and baby will tell us this . I 'll set it up . Guys , no mention of her parents . Sorry , about that . Yeah , look , are you going to call my fiancé ? Yes , but before we do that , those men I was just speaking with , they 're doctors . Hi , I 'm sorry to disturb you again . Uh , is your dad in ? Oh , he talked to my father . - Well , it 's a good thing , isn 't it ? - No . He told him that I was crazy and that I was harassing you . So , are you going to stop ? Maybe . Just look ... do you happen to know where he is ? He 's saving the world again I guess . I know . I mean ... his work on the biochemistry of SCF dependant ubiquitination and yeast was crucial on understanding cancer . - Oh , I 've read his articles . - What articles ? I mean I don 't know , he doesn 't tell me anything . - How come ? - ' Cause who really cares ? Uh , you should . I mean , he 's an amazing scientist . - Are you okay ? - Did you talk to him about me ? Kind of . Did you want to come in ? Her throat looks very red , has it been bothering her ? No . What did just say to her ? Not to worry . Could you tell me ? The virus is contained , still as a precaution , 20 people are quarantined behind me in this vacant warehouse that has now been dubbed " HAZMAT City " . However , officials are remaining tight lipped . Stan . Naomi , there are some reports that some 50 students from Irving Leighton High are spending the night in hospital . That 's right . The students are in hospital for observation . Yes , Stan , I can report that I am indeed talking out of my ass . And you 've got a great ass , Naomi , I 'd ask you to shake it for us if I didn 't think you were so full of shit . Good evening , people . I 've got samples . We might have patient zero , so Bob , DNA work . Hira , I want you check the serum for antibodies to every human virus , extract nucleic acid and do a probe on the viral gene chip . - Carlos- - - David . ... you handle pathology . Mayko , we need complete bioinformatics on all the samples , and Wes ... I could use a coffee . Caroline gave me very specific instructions about Hira . I don 't care . Daisy a paediatrician is here . A specialist , to look at Miranda to make sure she 's all right . She already had all those tests . No . No , she 's been through enough . I understand that , but there 's another test we have to do . - What ? Is she going to be okay ? - She 'll be fine . This will be the last time you 'll have to give her up , I promise . - Why does she have to be in that ? - Just for her safety . She 'll be fine . Okay , okay . I 'm right here . I 'm right here . Still no answer at William 's . Well , maybe he 's out or at a friends or something . That 's my girl . What were you doing in Africa ? I told you , I was working at an AIDS hospice . - Yes , but why Africa ? - Why not ? How would you describe your politics ? Uh , environmental anarchist . - Save the earth , that sort of thing . - Yeah , that sort of thing . You know , from governments , from multinationals , from governments run by multinationals . - Do you belong to a political party ? - You 're kidding me , right ? - How about William ? - No , not that I know of . Those are two different answers . Do either of you have any religious affiliations ? Christian , Muslim ? I 'm sorry , but what does this have to do with people being sick ? Thank you . Daisy , I need you to look at something . Would you step up to the glass please ? What , you want me to pick somebody out of a line up now ? Not exactly . Do you recognize this man ? - Why , is he sick too ? - This is from the U.K. passport office . This man 's passport was stolen 2 years ago . His name is William Zanzinger . So , what ? Are you trying to tell me there 's only one William Zanzinger in the world ? Only one who lives in Surrey and he 's never been to Africa . Oh , well , good for him ! He 's not my William . - Does your William have an accent ? - Yes . - What kind ? - English . - Where was he born ? - In England ! Did you ever see him use another passport ? Daisy , I want to help you get out of here . Maybe this is all a big misunderstanding . If so , let 's figure it out . Together . He has another passport , yes . To get into countries where he 's had trouble before . Like Zimbabwe . All journalists have them . Sure . What name is on that passport ? It 's really wild , I don 't get it . I ran the DNA on the baby 's throat swab and her blood . Baby 's throat , baby 's blood . - Run the test again . - We ran her DNA 3 times . The throat and blood doesn 't match . - It makes no sense . - That 's what I said . Okay , a viral infection would cause some differences in the DNA . Not this many . There 's way more than there should be . I can see that . Hira ! Look at this . Roll over . There , that band in her blood sample . It 's the same as DNA in neg to pos . It looks weird . There . That 's RNA . She 's right . Something is very wrong . Very , very wrong . RNA ? What 's it doing in the middle of her DNA ? What 'd they do ? Maybe if we can find out what kind of RNA we 're looking at ... You got an idea ? It 's a natural SIRNA . It should be in her throat . - SIRNA . - But it 's gone . - SIRNA . - Where the hell is it ? Holy shit . As SIRNA that kills viruses in plants ? Yeah , it 's in people too , right ? It 's probably just some leftover from billions of years ago when animals split from plants . Well , what if it 's that ? What if it does do something in people ? - Maybe , no one knows . - Well , maybe this bastard does know . Caroline , I 've got something ... I 'm on my way . Uh , I 'm not really that hungry . So , this whole like clone thing . You can 't actually ... I mean , you can 't actually clone someone , can you ? Well , yeah . I mean , well ... okay , look . Let 's just say that this olive is an egg , a human egg . Now first what you do ... is you remove the nucleus , or the core , you know , the brains of the cell . Then you insert the nucleus of the one that you want to clone like this . Now , to get it going you have to give it a little bit of a shock . That 's just for demonstration purposes only of course . Now the nucleus is reprogramming the egg and telling it what to be . - Okay , and then ? - Right , then ... uh , well now we wait until it grows and divides and when it 's stable enough , we place it into the womb and hope that the expression of the genetic makeup more or less resembles a human being . - The expression ? - Yeah .. You know like the way we look . - Yeah , well I think you look pretty good . - You don 't ... You don 't think I 'm a freak because I wasn 't born the normal way ? - Oh , and what 's the normal way ? - You know , like a mom and a dad , - 2 people in love ... - Man , you 've got to get out of the ' burbs . I 'm joking ! Geesh , it 's a joke . Thanks . - Halt ! Hey ! - I 'm with NorBAC . All right . Okay , not so fast . My brain can only absorb so many acronyms . What is SIRNA ? It 's a weapon that plants use to protect themselves from viruses . We have it too except nobody really knows what it does in people . - But we can make a logical assumption . - That it fights infections in people too ? Right . So , SIRNA is like this secret , quiet imperial guard and it 's all throughout the palace . Okay ? Head , shoulders , knees , toes . Except in Miranda 's case , it 's not in her throat . Someone figured out how to eliminate it from your throat ? Right , right , just her throat . So , if they did what I think they did , throat is the only room in the palace where there aren 't any guards . It 's the only place where the virus can live . From there , it leaves the palace , it spreads through cough , burp , sneeze or puke , and all the peasants who come in contact with it , they get the virus - Okay , okay , okay , stop . You 're telling me the baby has a virus , but can 't get the disease ? Exactly . So , the baby 's patient zero . - Nice work . - Oh well , it was a group effort really . Hira nailed it . - She was at the lab ? - She works there . David ... I think Daisy knows who did this . - What ? Jesus , you got a name ? - That 's what I 'm working on . Stick around , I may need your help . ... confirms that the U.S. has stepped up health monitoring at all border crossings . Meanwhile here in Toronto , health officials continue to remind people that washing your hands is the best way to prevent exposure to the mystery virus . An info line has been set- - You don 't have that disease thing they talked about , do you ? That 's about the only thing I don 't have . - So , what exactly is wrong with you ? - Exactly ? Well , my kidneys are going , my liver 's not great . Don 't even get me started on my spleen . That 's why your dad 's got to help me . Wait ... So , how did your body get so screwed up ? Well , uh , I was made ... so that I could give part of myself to my brother . - A part of yourself ? - Here , just ... That 's my brother , Cal . - He was always sick . - The same as you , or ... ? No , no , he had cancer of the bone marrow . They tried to find a match , they couldn 't , so that 's when my dad came up with the idea to make a clone and ... give marrow to Cal from the new Cal . He used you to save your brother . They had to do it a bunch of times because eventually the cancer would just come back . The last time was 2 years ago , but it didn 't ... see , it didn 't take at all , so ... so Cal died . I 'm sorry . And you ? That 's why your dad has to help me . Daisy . I want Miranda . I just saw her , she 's fine . She 's sleeping . They 're going to bring her to you as soon as she wakes up . - Daisy , was this a planned pregnancy ? - What ? Were you using birth control when you became pregnant ? I was on the pill . It 's not foolproof . - Apparently not . We need to talk about William . How did you meet ? - In Cape Town . - At a bar , a party , where ? - What difference does it make ? - So why don 't you just tell me ? I was almost raped . There were 3 guys , William came out of nowhere and ran them off . One man against 3 coming out of nowhere at just the right moment , sweeping you off your feet . - That 's what happened . - I bet William is really good looking too and he never hurt your feelings . You told all your girlfriends he was the perfect guy , right ? I bet you never even had a fight . Did you ? Ever ? Now is that real ? What are you talking about ? We 're in love with each other . We 're getting married on Sunday . The address you gave , there 's no such address in London . That 's not true . William 's cell phone is registered to a Nicholas Sargosa . Do you know who he is ? Nicholas Sargosa has hundreds of cell phones and he keeps losing them . He 's a front for people who want untraceable cell phones . - What ? - You said William was a writer . We haven 't found one thing he 's written . Who does he write for ? Progressive magazines . And he 's writing a book . - Who 's his publisher ? - I don 't know ! - But he got a big advance . - Of course . He 's got money . Maybe he writes under a pseudonym . Would you happen to know what that was ? No ! How is it going ? Ever use that thing ? Bet you got some pretty big bullets in there , eh ? Caroline 's ready for you . OK . Showtime ! How do I look ? Yeah ... Nice . Thanks for the chat . I don 't know , Wes , what do you think ? - I beg your pardon ? - The uniform , icy stare ... Does he do anything for you ? Hi , Daisy . I 'm , uh ... one of the doctors . - I know who you are . - Okay sure . Uh ... I need to know if you 've had any surgery since you got pregnant . Any medical procedures ? Amniocentesis . Uh ... why ? Women your age don 't usually get amnio . Because the baby was conceived in Africa and with all the diseases , - William wanted to be sure ... - Okay , okay . Uh , how was it done ... your amnio ? - I don 't know , I was unconscious . - For an amnio ? Okay , Daisy , here 's the story . Uh ... Someone has created a virus by combining 2 really horrible viruses , Ebola and Camelpox and this new virus is deadly ... and your baby has it . - Mir ... Miranda 's dying ? - Oh ! No , no . She 's okay . But here 's where it gets kind of crazy : She 's going to be okay because she 's been genetically modified to be immune to it . That 's insane ! That 's what they did to her during your so-called amnio . No , because I 've been with her since she was born and I 'm fine ! But you were exposed when Miranda was in your uterus and you developed immunity too . You can 't get it . You can 't get it , you can 't spread it , only Miranda can . - She 's what we call a carrier . - No ! Stop saying that ! Daisy , what 's inside Miranda kills faster than any known disease . - William put it there . - No , that 's bullshit ! That 's why he had you flying from Toronto to La Guardia ... Taking the shuttle bus to Kennedy , then flying to Heathrow . To spread it as far and as quickly as he could . No ! You know , he bought it that way because he was ... he was cashing in his points . You know . What 's wrong with you people ? What the fuck is wrong with you ? - The ticket was paid in cash . - No ! Look . Look ! He didn 't love you , Daisy . He set you up . He stopped those men from raping you and then he did it himself . No ! I want to go to the airport ! I want to go now ! I want to go ! He turned your daughter into a killing machine . That 's what William did . Now we need to find him and stop him before he does this again . I want my baby . I want my baby . Look at this woman ! Do you remember meeting her ? Her name 's Darlene Evans . She was your waitress . She 's dead . You won 't recognize this guy . Darlene 's husband . Paul . He 's dead . It 's spreading . Exponentially . - What do you want from me , okay ? - Tell me William 's other name . This is the man from the garage who drove you to the bus , Angus . He never even made it to the hospital . I need William 's name on his other passport . His name , Daisy ! Do you remember Frances ? - She died an hour ago . - You 're lying ! Her corpse is in this facility , do you want to see it ? No ! - Two people crossed all their paths . - No ! - You and Miranda . - No ! It could have been somebody else ! - It could have been anybody else ! No ! - Did anybody meet your parents ? They 're dead , Daisy . No ... No ! - I want my baby ! - We 'll bring her to you . Just give us his name and then you can have your baby . His name , Daisy ! Martin Jamison , i-s-o-n , 156 Shaftsbury Lane , flat # 3 , Farnham , England . It 's in Surrey . FBI , CSIS , and MI-5 ... Thank you . Jesus ! Are you all right ? - Where did you learn how to do that ? - Do what ? Take people apart like that . - If I said CIA , would you believe me ? - No . CIA . You hungry ? It 's an agency thing , David . I always buy my partners dinner after we do a good job . I could use a beer . Is there anything set up for Daisy and the baby ? We 'll probably get into that tomorrow . How do you tell a mother that her baby is going to live in quarantine for the rest of her life , poked and prodded by every scientist with half an interest in this thing ? If it was me , I 'd tell her the baby died . You wouldn 't want to give her some kind of hope ? Is there any ? I don 't know . Probably not . Daisy needs to pick up the pieces and start over again . You know what ? I 'm just going to go home . David , you don 't have to be involved . Ah ! I don 't have to be involved ? That 's a fucking relief . So I can just take off the rubber gloves , throw them in the garbage and walk away ? You did good work . We 're done here . That makes me feel so much better . There 's a woman in there who will never see her baby again because I did good work . Jesus , Caroline ! Lilith ? It 's to the point . Gone out . Be back . - L Did you ever see him use another passport ? What name is on that passport ? I want my baby ... Tell me William 's other name . His name ! I want my baby ! Morrison . I heard you . I think you 're making a mistake . Hey , we 're in this together , right ? Okay , this is where he keeps all his important stuff . I looked all over for a key . You think you can open it with ... ? Go for it . Did you hear that ? No . Okay . Here 's my birth certificate . Look at it , what does it say ? Uh ... February 16th , 1990 . - Here 's my mum 's death certificate . - This can 't be right ! Mick ? Mick ? What 's going on ? I didn 't hear you come in . Who 's your friend ? - I 'm Lilith Sandstrom . - I 've spoken with your father . - Yeah , Mick was telling me about Cal . - Now , let me guess . Not the clone story ? Yeah , I don 't think it was a story . Well , you might want to ask your father how likely it is . You should go , Lilith . - What ? - Mick isn 't well . - Yeah ! I know ! - No , I don 't just mean physically . I told your father and you might as well hear it too . Mick makes things up . - I do not . - Stories about his brother . - It helps him cope with the loss . - Oh yeah ? - Well , how do explain- - - Lilith . - Mick ? What ? Why ? - What 's going on , Mick ? - Nothing . Just go . - Mick ? - Hey , you okay ? - No ! - Oh oh ... What time is it ? - I don 't know . - Where were you ? - I was with Mick . - The guy 's a freak , Lilith . I told you ... - Yes , dad , I know . Shit , what did he do ? Would you just look at this ? - Death certificate . Nice . - With Mick 's mum . And ... this is his birth certificate . Well , he 's human . Dad , can you please just look at the dates ? Let me guess ! His mother died 2 years before he was born . Hmm ? He told me Lilith . It 's a neat trick , but come on ! - Okay , well , then explain it ! - My grandfather had a birth certificate that said he was born in Sweden and he had another birth certificate that said he was born in Canada . Well , I guess he was born again , then . Look ... Mick 's fucked up . All he wants is the truth . Why can 't you just have a look at him ? - Truth , huh ? - Why can 't you just tell him ... whether you can help him ... or not ? - Somebody should tell him the truth . - But will you ? Caroline 's had Hira in there all morning . - But where 's David ? - Good question . - Where 's David ? I need to show him this . - What ? I ran the DNA comparisons he asked me to on those 2 kids . He needs to look at them . It 's very odd . - These are from 2 different people ? - Their DNA is identical . - Twins . - No , they are brothers . Two years apart . - With identical DNA ? Bob . - I didn 't make a mistake . Then I guess they 're clones . Ha ... Maybe I 'll get better samples . - Yeah , do that my friend . - Mayko ? Could I see you for a minute ? Don 't pull them all the way out , okay ? Hey , Daisy . When do we get out of here ? Daisy , Miranda can 't leave . Do you understand ? What 's going to happen to her ? What are they going to do to her ? I want the truth ! She 'll be moved to a lab . She 'll have to live in quarantine . For how long ? For the rest of her life . Sorry , there 's no other alternative . There 's no hope ? You 're so beautiful . So tiny . Daisy , I am so sorry . I 'm so sorry . Daisy ? Daisy ? Oh shit ! - She 's killing her kid ! - You can 't go in there ! Let go ! Let go ! Subtitles by kubilai Lama Transcript by RaceMan

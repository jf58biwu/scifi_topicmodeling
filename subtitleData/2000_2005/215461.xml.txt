 My doom is sealed , but I 'm not resigned to fate . I hate man . A long time ago , I was forced to leap down for fate at here . I remember my mocking smile . Afterwards I was buried here . The villagers named this place the Virgin 's Tomb . These villagers shared a weird belief : All dead man are lonely . And they would find a mate for those who died unmarried . These dead would then not be alone . After all , it is a bargain . Kowtow , to the heavens ! Kowtow , to your parents ! Kowtow , to your bride or groom ! Consummate the marriage . Old fella ... The deal is done ! Your son in the underworld will like his bride . Your will is satisfied ! As agreed yesterday : Payment on delivery . Er-gou , this payment ... I have a problem . What ? We 're counting on it ! I 'll need a couple more days ... Mother fucking old fella ! Still owe us several thousand dollars . He paid three thousand . Unless the balance is settled , or we 'll fuck him . I 'll dig his ancestors ' graves . Have I made it clear ? Let us kill the chicken . We 'll eat and get drunk ! No way , you still owe us ten thousand . Pay us or we 'll maim you . Mother fucker ! Dead ? Mother fucker ! Why so stubborn ? Isn 't it money you 're after ? Mother fucker ! We still have work to do . When they bought me I was only eight years old . And my husband , Sissy , was only four years old . Besides sheep , Sissy takes to nothing except me and Chun Sheng . Where is Chun Sheng ? Shhh ! Chun Sheng is an orphan He has no family . As a child I was fond of him and he was fond of me and Sissy . Village leader , you 've kept us waiting for the whole day . Let us get drunk ! Quiet , you fellows . I have a few words to say . It is the wedding day for Sissy and Qing Hua . On behalf of the official and everyone . I congratulate them As the saying goes : Grow up , marry and propagate . This is the wedding day for all three of us . With or without the wedding I 'm already their wife . It is a secret among us . Let us toast the new couple ! Village leader , bottoms up ! Come on , Sissy and Qing Hua ! The village leader is toasting you ! Get up , quickly . May you be happy and have kids soon . No problem ! Let me drink on their behalf , Uncle De . Name my future grandchild , village leader . Let us call him " Xiao Kang " . Good ! We 'll call him " Xiao Kang " Let us light fire crackers . Storm the new couple 's bedroom . Chun Sheng ! I 've been hiding for the whole day . I 'm dying of thirst ! Shhh ! Come on Let us toast ourselves . Not for me - it is not tasty . Sissy Drink it like a real man ! Drink it ! Drink it I 'll show you . There you go again ! Drink it or I 'll be anger with you . Let us drink together Drink it Sissy It 's getting late . Let us quit drinking . It is time for bed . Oh ! Go and take a look . Drink ! You haven 't been drinking much . I 've been drinking too much today ! Something is on my mind lately . Drink , today is a wedding day . My uncle passed away recently . Fit as a fiddle , but died suddenly . He lived a tough life and died unmarried . As his nephew and village leader , I need to take care of him . I 'm counting on you to find him a wife and arrange a grand wedding . Who is it ? Why , you scared the hell out of me . What is it ? You left your socks in my place . Oh , where is Qing Hua ? She didn 't come . Where are you working ? I 'm going to Village leader 's house soon . Go and tend to your flock . Sissy , look for me if you 're coming home early . Take care . I 'm just a pebble quietly buried in the mud . I pray to pave a colorful way leading us to light and happiness . I 'm done . Sissy , discard the crumbs . Let me help you . No need . Qing Hua , You look better with your hair down . I like to get a shampoo . Shampoo ? Why not ! I 'll fetch the water . Sissy , let 's go and fetch water . Qing Hua ? Qing Hua ? Where have you been ? What is the matter ? You 're tired ? It is getting late . We should be going home . We 're leaving . Qing Hua Just now , I saw something which you 'll find incredible . What is it ? Village leader , dead women are hard to come by . Er-gou , do whatever you can ! I 'll pay for it . The Virgin Tomb is still intact . What do you think ? Don 't touch the Virgin 's Tomb . I 'll keep my eyes open . You can count on me . Qing Hua , come over here . Put the firewood over here . Let me comb your hair . Here ? Put it down ! Sit down . Qing Hua , can Sissy manage it in bed ? Did he hurt you ? I also knew nothing on my wedding night . I was scared when your dad wanted to do it . There , you look like a married woman . Mom , I know what is expected of me . Qing Hua , you 're married and need to bear kids . Do you get it ? We 're worried you might not get it . It is fine even if Sissy doesn 't get it . Qing Hua , tell Sissy to come home for dinner . It is getting so late . Oh ! Chun Sheng Qing Hua Have you seen Sissy today ? No ! Why ? He hasn 't returned from shepherding . Lost his way ! Why ? Not home yet ? Come , let us look for him . Chun Sheng ? Sissy ... Sissy You 've kept us worried . Get up and come home with us . This tomb is for Qing Hua . That tomb is for Chun Sheng . Let us play the dead . Say that again and we won 't give a damn about you . Get up quickly and come home with us . Get moving or we 'll leave with your sheep . Qing Hua , let us go . Sissy , where have you been ? What have kept you so late ? You know the place we 've just been to ? It looked strange to me . I 've never been there . Chun Sheng , come in for a while ! No , thanks ! I 'm going home . No ? No ! Qing Hua Who is it ? Er-gou . Don 't be scared ! What are you doing in my home ? Don 't yell ! Buddy , do me a favor . Let us team up and make some money . What the hell can we do together ? What 's the deal ? Monkey business . I have neither money for you nor your goods . You 're penniless ! I bet you 've never seen so much money ! What 's the deal ? I promise you 'll be rich in three days . Really ? Qing Hua , Qing Hua You have such nice hair . When I died I was all alone and I lost my hair . These men ruined me . Qing Hua , it 's time for your medicine . Who led you to those weird tombs ? Sheep ! I won 't let go there again . Qing Hua ? How is she doing ? She is sick and has slept for 3 days . She had a cold . I 'll treat her with cupping . You roll her over . The cupping will help her recover quickly . Qing Hua , Don 't you know that village leader will get a wife for his dead uncle . Er-gou came to me yesterday and asked me to help him dig graves . I was scared and rejected him . Chun Sheng , you better go home . It is getting late . Sissy will look after Qing Hua . Qing Hua , I 'm leaving . Sissy , look after her carefully . Chun Sheng came to visit you late last night . Virgin , the moon is bright and the water clear . You need not return in a hurry . Virgin , blame not fate for unfairness . You need not return in a hurry Your beauty beat Diana . Your tragic fate rivaled Desdemona . Pity you were ensnared by rapists . Virgin , you were doomed by fate . Virgin , the moon is bright and the water clear . Who will avenge your death ? You defended your chastity . You died in purity . This is " The Virgin Ballad " handed down generations after generations . Do you know it ? Mom , who was the Virgin ? She was not a native . She passed by our village on her way and rapists forced her to leap to her death . Qing Hua , farmers have their own rules and shepherds have their own rules . You 're married , and you should behave yourself . You get it ? I bought you when you 're a kid . For years I 've raised you like my own daughter . Mom , I 'll take care of Sissy till I die . You can rest assured . So long as you take care of Sissy , dad and mom will be contented . I don 't care about chastity . I 'm not like you . I don 't need to be chaste .

I know she will take both of you away . Why ? She brought Sissy back to us . Why would she do it ? She is plotting something . She wants to take both of you from me . Qing Hua , why would Yan-yan take us away from you ? Who is the Virgin ? The Virgin ? The Virgin is a bad girl . But Yan-yan doesn 't look like a bad girl .

We 're staying together . I 'm sleepy . Come , go to sleep . Go to sleep . I 'm just a pebble quietly buried in the mud . I 'm just a pebble quietly buried in the mud .

She is better off than you . I don 't see how ? At least I died in purity . You only have your purity honor . But you have nobody . You 're pitiful . I 'll follow you until they discard you . You 've only yourself to blame . You won 't spare even the dead virgin . And made me marry a stranger . Nobody can abuse me anymore whether alive or dead . Look , how weak men really are .

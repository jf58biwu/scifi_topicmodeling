 The invitation was for all of you . The others are still in the Transport Pod . Prudent , but unnecessary . Talyn , scan Officer Sun . Unarmed , as I requested . And you are still armed . How are we supposed to trust you ? Talyn , I am now engaging privacy mode and full manual overrides . I will relink with you within the arn . My mind and Talyn 's are no longer joined . I am , therefore ... defenseless . Pilot , has Talyn grown bigger since last we saw him ? His , uh , cannon ... sure looks bigger . He has indeed grown . Moya is pleased that 's he 's healthy and happy . Huh . How happy can he be under the control of that madman , Crais ? Quite happy , or so he claims . And he insists that Crais hasn 't mistreated him . Is that Talyn talking or Crais ? Evidently Talyn . Crais has removed the neural transponder . I called for a truce , Crichton . I 'm a man of my word . Oh , yeah ? When did that start ? Ka D 'Argo . Pa 'u Zhaan . A Banik slave ? A Banik , yes , but no longer a slave . You were at Scorpius' Gammak Base . A prisoner with Crichton . I 'm flattered you remember me . My name is Stark . Shall we skip the meet and greet ? Why did you call us ? Despite my best efforts , Talyn is becoming more aggressive , more destructive . You must help me disarm him . Disarm Talyn ? Mmm , are mother and child still catching up on old times ? Yep . They 're chattering away like a pair of bleethiks . Yes , well what are the others chattering about ? Well , I don 't know . - They 've been over there forever . I can 't believe Crais is that good a conversationalist . Another vessel is approaching fast . It 's a Plokavian ship . Oh , is that good or bad ? Bad ... very bad . What 's Talyn doing ? Oh , that cannon 's definitely grown . Crichton ! What the frell is going on over there ? There 's another Plokavian ship heading towards us . Great . Can Talyn go two-for-two ? How soon can we Starburst ? I 'm just asking . Talyn stopped talking to Moya . Pilot , we 're on our way back . Crank up the docking web , open the barn door , and pull us in A.S.A.P. Watch your trajectory ! Talyn 's going into Starburst . Crichton ! You must hurry ! A second Plokavian vessel is closing in . We 're rolling as fast as we can . Not fast enough . Crichton ? Crichton ! Anybody ? My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms . Help me . Listen , please . Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . I 'm doing everything I can . I 'm just looking for a way home . How is everybody ? D 'Argo 's still out , but he doesn 't seem to be hurt . Where 's Aeryn ? We don 't know . She wasn 't here when we all awoke . Aeryn ! Aeryn ? Pilot . Sparky . No . The Comms aren 't working . Whatever immobilized us in the Transport Pod knocked out the Comms as well . The Dampening Net . It 's the only Plokavian weapon that isn 't lethal . Aeryn ? Aeryn ! Wow ! How far down does that go ? That 's a long way down . Either that or they 've got deep shag carpet . You ? ! This is all your fault ! Stop it ! - But he ... Quiet . Cut it out . Where the hezmana are we ? Some kind offloading hubcap . Hoobkap ? Where 's Aeryn ? Good question . Bad answer . I have told you , no one is responsible . Someone is . You destroyed a Plokavian vessel . You say Talyn is a living ship . Is Talyn responsible ? There is no way that Talyn could have fired that cannon on his own . His manual overrides were engaged . Then one of you must have fired it . The one who fled on Talyn . Uh ... Crais . Could he have done it ? He was nowhere near the weapon 's console . We don 't believe you . Are you protecting him ? No . Look , if I wanted to lie it would be easy to blame it on Crais , wouldn 't it ? After all , he and Talyn fled , did they not ? If they hadn 't , would it make a difference to your story ? No . You 're lying . You don 't want to see either of them dispersed . Look , I am not lying . And I don 't want to see anyone dispersed . Not even the guilty party ? There is no guilty party . I 'm telling you , it must have been an accident . Ridiculous ! We should just execute all of you . Then we could be sure that the guilty party was punished . Do I offend your senses ? No . You seem distressed . Did you do it ? You are protecting yourself , aren 't you ? No . I 'm telling you what happened . Tell me again , without the lies ! Start from where the others joined you on Talyn . All right . D 'Argo , Zhaan , and Stark followed Crichton in . Pa 'u Zhaan , join us . A Banik slave ? Banik , yes , but no longer a slave . You were on Scorpius' Gammak Base . A prisoner with Crichton . Flattered you remember me . My name is Stark . Shall we skip the meet and greet ? Why did you phone us ? Despite my best efforts , Talyn is becoming more aggressive , more destructive . I need your help to disarm him . Disarm Talyn ? Not entirely . We still need to protect ourselves , of course . I merely wish to make his armament non-lethal by trading his main cannon for a Dampening Net which will incapacitate hostile vessels . Where will you obtain a Dampening Net ? From a Plokavian arms dealer . The Plokavians ? Are you serious ? Who are the Plokavians ? They 're a race who build powerful and dangerous weapons . Yes . However , what I want is a simple Dampening Net . Peacekeeper lies ! This has to be a trap to get more dangerous weapons aboard Talyn . Hear him out , D 'Argo . Leave D 'Argo alone . He has a point . If Crais is right about this Dampening Net being non-lethal then maybe it 's a good thing for Talyn . Exactly . We would need to supervise the installation , of course . Certainly . I see a potential difficulty here . What if Talyn doesn 't want us frelling with his weaponry ? He will if I say it 's okay . I need your help , and Moya 's , to convince Talyn to accept the modifications . I will not be a party to this . Yeah , I have a problem . I mean , come here . What do we know about these Plakavoids ? It 's Plokavians , John and how much do we really need to know ? It 's a simple transaction . One that benefits Talyn . Well , I 'm not sure I agree . I 'm going to have to think about this and perhaps even meditate on the subject . Enough thinking ! If we really want to help Talyn , then we should kill Crais ! I am up for that . No ! That doesn 't help anything . - Indeed not . Talyn would become more destructive without my guidance . You mean , your control ! I can only control him to a point . I can 't even convince him to use his weapons as a last resort . Well , perhaps there I might have more success . I am willing to link up with Talyn for a direct conversation . But Crais is the only one that Talyn trusts . That is Talyn 's mistake . How are we gonna trust Crais again ? I have not misused Talyn 's power . I 've only used it in self-defense . Well , maybe Crais is right , John . We do know of Talyn 's encounter with the Halosians . They attacked us . It was all that I could do to stop Talyn from utterly destroying them . Aeryn , what a stack of dren . I still say we kill Crais . Well I don 't know who to believe . I have changed , Crichton . My only concern is for Talyn 's protection . Left unchecked , his aggressiveness will lead to disaster . The Plokavian vessel 's here . Crais , we 've arrived . Yes . You 're ahead of schedule . Your ship is still active . Manual override is engaged , as is privacy mode . Talyn is no longer monitoring this conversation . As you wish . They are armed . Very well armed . Perhaps we 'd better raise the Defense Screen just in case . No . That may be interpreted as a sign of bad faith . But with Talyn 's defensives on manual override , he can 't defend himself . Is there a problem , Crais ? No problem . Let 's discuss the terms of our agreement . Who fired that shot ? ! Nobody and Proximity Sensors were switched off . I must communicate with Talyn and find out . Turn off the privacy mode , we 'll tell him ourselves . Aeryn , don 't give him back that transponder . I have another ! You frelled us ! What 's happening ? He 's taking over Talyn again . Leave my ship now ! You have to stay and explain this to the Plokavian authorities ! No , Aeryn ! We have to go now ! Come on ! - I can 't let you do this ! Go ! I would have tried to remove Crais 's Transponder and forced him to stay , but the others wouldn 't risk it . So , we all left in the Transport Pod and watched Talyn Starburst away under Crais ' control . So , the cannon just went off my itself . No one had anything to do with it . You understand we might find that difficult to accept . It 's the truth . That little dren ! Why aren 't you on the Command ? There 's no food on the Command . You are supposed to be negotiating with the Plokavians ! We 've got to get the others back . They won 't negotiate . Ha , they won 't even respond . So , unless you have any bright ideas ... Pilot ? Oh ! Feels like we 're moving . Pilot , are we moving ? Yes . Moya 's looking for Talyn . Huh ! Talyn Starburst away . Moya hasn 't got a skizzik 's chance of finding him . She may not , but she wishes to try anyway . Well , what about Crichton and the others ? Our absence will not change their situation . However , if Moya locates Talyn , she might persuade him to return with us and help free them . Might ? Well , there 's , uh ... there 's nothing to hold onto . Where would we go anyway ? Sooner or later , one of us is going to have to find a bathroom . I really wish you hadn 't said that . - What 's that ? Aeryn . Aeryn . You okay ? Where have you been ? Being questioned by the Plokavians . They want to know what happened aboard Talyn . We 'll all be questioned . Don 't lie to them . Lying will get us all executed . What did you tell them ? - The truth . Oh God , I missed you so much . God ! I was so worried about you ! Play along . Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan . I missed you , too , John . Hold me . Are they listening ? I have to assume so . I told them no one was responsible for firing Talyn 's weapons , that he must have malfunctioned . That 's not much of a story . Only one I had . We got to let the others know . John ! But , but ... Frell . Ah , ah , that 's one reason Crais called for us . Ah , Talyn had been experiencing some ah , problems with his circuitry . Please resume your testimony . You are about to enter Talyn 's bridge . Ah , yes . Ah , Crichton went first and ... and um ... You were on Scorpius' Gammak Base . A prisoner with Crichton . I 'm flattered you remember me . My name is Stark . Can we skip the meet and greet ? Why did you call us ? Despite my best efforts , Talyn 's becoming more aggressive , more destructive . You must help me disarm him . Disarm Talyn ? Not entirely . We still need to defend ourselves , of course . I merely wish to make his armament non-lethal by trading his main cannon for a Dampening Net which will incapacitate hostile vessels . Where will you obtain a Dampening Net ? From a Plokavian arms dealer . Plokavians ? ! Oh , I 've heard of them . Quite far advanced technologically . Strong believers in truth and justice . So you wish to trade Talyn 's main cannon with these Plokavians in exchange for a Dampening Net ? Precisely . Given that Talyn 's circuitry has been prone to malfunction lately , equipping him with a non-lethal weapon would seem to me to be in everyone 's best interests . Except I don 't trust you . John , it pains me to realize you still haven 't forgiven me for my past misdeeds . However , you can supervise the installation yourself . You 'll need our help and Moya 's if you want to sedate Talyn for the modifications . Oh , wow . That , I ... I hadn 't thought about that . Talyn might not want to give up his cannon , right ? Talyn was designed by Peacekeepers . Peacekeepers never give up their weapons . Good point . But it 's in his best interest , so we should let Crais do it . Yeah , I guess we should . Sounds very reasonable to me . Mmm . You 're saying that nobody had a problem with Crais ' plan ? Oh , no , of course they did , um ... And that 's when D 'Argo lost his temper . And why did he do that ? Well , he 's a Luxan , and Luxans are subject to fits of hyper-rage . Well ... and he lost his son , you know . That made him edgy . What are you talking about , John ? I will not be a party to this ! Why not , D 'Argo ? What if he 's lying ? What if this is just a trick to get even worse weapons aboard Talyn ? Oh , yeah , th-that 's a good point . D 'Argo makes a good point ... D 'Argo is thinking with his mivonks again . A Plokavian Dampening Net is just what Talyn needs . If this is a trick , Crais , I 'll break your neck . No trick . I just want to help Talyn . He doesn 't need your help . He most certainly does . Talyn would be even more destructive without my guidance . Don 't you mean your control ? I only control him to a point . Believe me , it 's been hard to convince Talyn that the use of his weapons should only be as a last resort . Let me communicate with him . I 'll teach him to behave . Officer Sun , Talyn trusts me . I sure don 't . John , I have not misused Talyn 's power . I 've only fired his cannons in self-defense . Yes , he may be speaking the truth . Consider his encounter with the Halosians . He could 've destroyed them , but he didn 't . Correct . They attacked us , but I showed restraint . Now doesn 't that demonstrate my good intentions ? The Plokavian 's vessel is here . Let 's finalize arrangements . Crais , we 're here . Right on schedule . Your ship is still active . Manual override ... - Beautiful ship , isn 't it ? Mmm . Quite aesthetically pleasing . Weapons Console malfunction . No , no , stay away ! We have to disarm it . You might set it off . The Plokavians will have great difficulty believing there was an accident . We 'd better go ! No . If the authorities arrive , you and Talyn should be here to explain . I can 't take that chance . Leave now , or I 'll force you ! He has another transponder . Now , go ! There was nothing we could do , so ... we boarded the Transport Pod to return to Moya ... and , um ... and that 's when you captured us . Any more questions ? This is the weirdest hoosegow I 've ever been in . Slammer , clink , jail , prison . Just how many of them have you been in ? Just what are you implying ? Zhaan , How 'd it go ? I told them what I saw . I hope they believe me . If they don 't , we all die . I know that . Stark ! Just see that you remember it . D 'Argo . Chill out , bro . He said he only wanted a Dampening Net , but I didn 't believe him . Why not ? He 's , uh ... an ex-Peacekeeper captain who abandoned his own people and abducted Talyn . He 's completely power-mad . The reformed Crais is just an act . Crichton wasn 't buying it , either . You expect us to help you . You must help me . Talyn is refusing to permit any modifications . Good for Talyn . Evidently , your control over him isn 't as absolute as you thought . John , give me the word and I 'll break his neck . You don 't dare . Talyn will be lost without my guidance . He needs a captain . He chose me . Well , perhaps we should override that choice . I have not misused Talyn 's power . I 've only fired his cannons in self-defense . As you did with the Halosians . They attacked us . I spared their lives . I 'm not a killer . I don 't care what you say . We 're not going to help you . You 'll regret this . I assure you . The Plokavians are here . Crais , your ship is still active . Never mind . Our deal is cancelled . I cannot permit that . The contract stands . That 's not what the others told us . You want us to believe they 're protecting Crais ? ! No . They 're protecting Talyn . They know you 'd have to destroy Talyn to bring Crais to justice . And you don 't care about Talyn ? Not as much as I care about the others . Besides , you may never catch them . Any sign of Talyn ? None . Moya is completely wasting her time . Pilot , we really should head back now . Moya wants to keep looking . She 's not looking ; she 's flying around in circles ! We are following a spiral search pattern of my own devising , which maximizes the possibility that we ... That we completely lose our bearings and never find our way back to the others ! I 'm doing as Moya wishes . Do not question us ! Well done , Chiana . You could have a fine career as a diplomat . Frell you , Rygel . Given your excellent way with words . Watch your step . It 's a long way down . Keep bothering me and I 'll test that theory by throwing you over it . Just trying to cheer you up . Don 't bother . Prisoners , your testimonies do not correspond . Unless we hear the truth , you will all be executed ! What did you say to them ? Leave me alone . - Tell me ! I said get away from me ! My mask ! Give me my mask ! What 's happening to him ? Help me ! My mask ! Help me ! My mask ! Help me ! Help me ! Shh ! What the hell was that ? My mask keeps my energies in check . I ... I wasn 't prepared to lose it . I ... I lost control . I wasn 't focused . D 'Argo , that didn 't help . Oh , and Stark 's lies will ? Ka D 'Argo ! I 'll tell them what I really saw . Plokavians ? Are you farhbot ? And who are the Plokavians ? Barbarians . Murderers . Builders of horrific weapons . Uh , shatter grenades . Novatrin gas . Seismic disruptors . They 're frelling savages who deal in death . Savages ! That was the word he used . Then Aeryn decided to step in and defend Crais . Crais only wants a Dampening Net . Dren ! I think he wants to equip Talyn with even deadlier weapons . You know what I think ? I think you are right . Not at all . You can supervise the installation yourself . No , we must leave now ! You can 't leave . I need your help and Moya 's to sedate Talyn for the modifications . We will not be a party to this . We must stop the Plokavians . They 're evil . Their weapons have helped enslave many worlds , including mine . But this weapon will help Talyn . I think I know how to help Talyn . Why don 't we break Crais ' neck ? I am down with that . Violence will not solve the problem . Indeed not . Killing me would harm Talyn . He would be even more destructive without my guidance . You mean , your control ? I only control him to a point . I could help with that , if you 'd let me . He won 't . He wants to keep Talyn 's powers for his own selfish purposes . Yeah . I have not misused Talyn 's power . I 've only fired in self-defense . He may be right . We do know of Talyn 's encounter with the Halosians . He stopped Talyn from destroying them . The Plokavians are here . Oh , tell them you 've changed your mind . Don 't deal with them . Crais , we 've arrived . Ahead of schedule . Your vessel has not been sedated . Privacy mode is engaged . Talyn can 't hear this conversation . It 's well-armed . Look at the cargo analysis . Novatrin gas . Eats you alive , from the inside out . We can 't let Crais get near these monsters . We have to strike first . Stop ! What have you done ? Give it up , Crais . Stark frelled you , Crais . Yeah , you 're not getting this back either . He 's got another transponder . What 's happened ? He 's back in control of Talyn . Did you think that I 'd give her my only transponder ? Now , get off my ship ! Stark fired the cannon . Yes , but I will never mourn the death of someone who deals in Novatrin gas . Then why turn Stark in ? Because the rest of us should not be responsible for something that he alone did . D 'Argo 's testimony 's going to get me executed . I 'm sure of it . But you didn 't fire the cannon . I know I didn 't . You have to believe me . I didn 't do it . Hey ! I 'm sorry I yelled at you . It 's just , it 's ... it 's been over three arns . Just between you and me , wh-what are our chances of finding Talyn ? Minuscule . So , what are we doing ? Moya feels guilty . Why ? Because ... because Talyn blew up some weapons dealer ? Well if you ask me , they had it coming . Talyn 's her son , Chiana . She feels responsible for what he does . Yeah , but doesn 't she also feel responsible for D 'Argo , Crichton ... Zhaan ? Aeryn ? Don 't you ? You 're the Pilot . Aren 't you ? I will not force her to abandon the search . But I will ask her . But what if they manage to escape in the Transport Pod , and ... and we 're not there to get them ? Moya understands your concern , and she agrees with it . She does ? I 'm setting a return course now . John Crichton ! Who fired the cannon ? Nobody did . Must have been a malfunction . Stark was at the Weapons Console . He was frantic . Before I could stop him , he fired the cannon . D 'Argo said that ? Was he lying ? He ... was confused . Stark 's never even been aboard Talyn . He probably wouldn 't know how to find the Weapons Console . Stark offered to raise Talyn 's Defense Screen . He started towards the Weapons Console , but I stopped him before he could touch anything . Well that makes sense . D 'Argo sees Stark near the Weapons Console so after the big bang , he assumes it 's Stark because Stark was the closest . Well , no one ever approached the Weapons Console . When it malfunctioned , Crichton started toward it but Aeryn told him not to touch it . Then you were the closest . Look , you guys have gotta understand something . Everybody 's stories are gonna be a little different . Nobody sees things the exact same way . We do ! What , ten Plokavoids see a fender bender . Do you get ten identical reports ? Yes . Well , the rest of the universe doesn 't work that way . There 's going to be some inconsistencies . Such as this one ? Then Crais got angry and marched over to the Weapons Console and pressed a control . That 's when the ... the cannon fired . Stark hates Peacekeepers . He 'd like to see you go after Crais , even if Crais didn 't destroy your ship . Stop ! We have heard enough ! You 're all lying ! Further testimony is a waste of time ! The executions will begin immediately ! Look , tell us who the guilty one is and we 'll spare the others . Otherwise , we will commence the executions with you . There 's just nothing new in the universe , is there ? It 's the same everywhere . Good cop , bad cop . You think we 're bluffing ? Nope . I don 't think you give a damn about the truth . I think you 're looking for a scapegoat . We want justice . All right , then , listen up . Yes ... we are lying . You say we 're going to be executed at dawn . Is it some big surprise that we cover for one another ? No , but it must stop . Okay . It stops here . I 'll give it to you straight . I don 't know what happened . Probably never will . Could have been Stark , could have been Crais , could have been any one of us . The best I can do is tell you what I saw . No coverings , no editorials , no axes to grind . Does that work for you ? Go on . All right . We 're good , right up to the point where Crais tells us about the Plakavoids . The Plakavoids , are you farbot ? Who are the Plakavoids ? A dangerous race who build horrific weapons . Shatter grenades that turn bones to powder . Seismic Disrupters that can destroy entire planets . And Novatrin gas , which eats your body alive . What 's your point ? All I want is a Dampening Net . Well , suppose what you really want is to install even deadlier weapons on Talyn ? You can supervise the installation yourself . In fact , I 'll need your help and Moya 's to sedate Talyn for the modification . He won 't part with his cannon willingly . Interesting . Can you blame him for that ? No , we cannot be a party to this . We can 't have anything to do with this . The Plakavoids are an evil race . Their weapons have helped enslave many worlds , including my own . This weapon will help Talyn . I know a way we can help Talyn . Why don 't we just break your neck ? That would exacerbate the problem . Talyn would be even more destructive without my guidance . You mean your control ? I only control him to a point . And I can 't seem to convince him that the use of his weapons should only be as a last resort . Perhaps another captain would have more success . Doubtful , he trusts me . Then he 's the only one around here who does . I have not misused Talyn 's power . I 've only fired his cannons in self-defense . John , we do know of Talyn 's encounter with the Halosians . Correct , they attacked us . It was all I could do to stop Talyn from finishing them off . Yeah , right . I have changed , Crichton . My only concern is for Talyn 's protection . Left unchecked , his aggressiveness will lead to disaster . The solution I propose ... The Plakavoidian vessel 's here . This is wrong . We shouldn 't deal with them . Crais , assuming we want to neuter Talyn , are these really the people we want to be in business with ? Do you know anyone else who can provide Talyn what he needs ? Crais , we 've arrived . Yes , you 're ahead of schedule . Your ship is still active . Privacy mode is engaged . Talyn can 't hear this conversation . Stark , what are you doing ? We have to strike first . What have you done ? And then Crais forced us off the ship . You assert that Stark did touch something at the Weapons Console ? After I shut down the console . With the safety on , Stark couldn 't do a thing . He did not fire the cannon . Nobody did . And that 's how I saw it . Cross my heart , hope to die , stick a needle in my eye . There 's nothing Crichton can do . I 'm going to be executed . Wonder how they 'll do it . Pulse fire ? Strangulation ? Maybe even Novatrin gas . They mentioned something called dispersal . What else did they say ? I didn 't ask for details . Why ? Because there 's a remote chance that I could survive dispersal . My physical form is only part of my reality . Much of me is energy that I can control and project . The energy his mask holds in . Maybe if I 'm prepared for it , I can transfer enough of myself into another realm to survive . Well , we do know that creatures like Maldis can be dispersed and and re-coalesce . Maybe I can return to this realm some day . No . No , I don 't believe it either . But even a remote possibility is ... Prisoners ! We have considered your testimonies and reached a conclusion . Your lack of candor gives us no choice but to have you all put to death . Oh , I don 't believe this ! Hey , I was straight with you ! Start with the Peacekeeper ! Wait ! I cannot let the others die on my behalf . I have to tell the truth . I fired on the Plokavian ship and destroyed it . Stark , don 't ! You freely confess your crime ? Yes , I do . Does that surprise you ? Not in the least . You were our prime suspect from the start . I thank you all for the great risks you took to save a mere Banik slave . Your acceptance ... your friendship ... has meant a lot to me . You have confessed to the crime of murder . Are you ready to accept the penalty ? Ready . The Plokavian ship has departed , And Moya 's ready to Starburst once you 're back aboard . Thank you , Pilot . I misjudged Stark . I thought he was trying to save himself , but he was really trying to save us all . He shouldn 't have died for his crime . What crime ? Stark committed no crime . I saw him fire the cannon . So did I. You saw him press the fire button . I had shut down the Weapons Console so he couldn 't fire . Did you know what else would happen when you neutralized the controls ? I knew that shutting down the Weapons Console would kill the manual override , yeah . Hmm . You returned control of the weapons to Talyn . Why would Talyn fire ? When Talyn scanned the arms dealers cargo , he asked Moya what it was . She realized it was Novatrin gas , one of the six forbidden cargoes no Leviathan may carry . Moya clued him in . And Talyn destroyed that ship . He thought he was protecting Moya . You 'll find him . I know I will . But only because Stark came back to tell me where he was . Why did he do that ? Well , he ... he felt he owed you and Crichton a debt . Maybe this was his way of repaying it . I 've become so distrustful of people , even when they 're trying to help me . What does that say about what I 've become ? Can I ask you a question ? Mm-hmm . When the Plokavians were questioning you , why didn 't you try to finger Crais ? What if they believed me ? They probably would have gone after Crais and they would have had to kill Talyn to get to him . So , you were protecting Talyn ? Of course . And that 's it ? Yes . Can I ask you something ? Mm-hmm . Do you think it 's possible ... that Stark survived ? Since I got here , I 've seen a lot of impossible things . Well , Zhaan thinks it 's possible . Yeah , she says she does . But I don 't think she believes it .

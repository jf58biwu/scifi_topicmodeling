 We have another case . It could be a busload . There 's nothing to worry about , you 're being put in quarantine . But the girl she was sitting next to , the one you 're looking at , had contact with just about everyone who 's gotten sick . My dad came up with the idea to make a clone . He used you to save your brother . Okay people , I 've got samples . We might have patient zero . - She was at the lab ? - She works there . - Here 's my birth certificate . - This can 't be right . My mother died 2 years before I was born , Dr. Sandstrom . Get me the samples . But I mean it , you stay away from my daughter . Caroline took me to her office , asked me all kinds of questions about Hira . - Her family , her brothers . - Where the hell is it ? Holy shit . siRNA is like this imperial guard except in Miranda 's case it 's not in her throat . - So , the baby 's patient zero . - How do you tell a mother her baby 's going to live in quarantine for the rest of her life ? - All he wants is the truth . - Somebody should tell him the truth . But will you ? There 's no hope ? Oh shit . 1x03 - The Face of God Young lady , would you put your mask on please ? I 'm Dr Sandstrom 's daughter . Hi . Hi . So , are you going to die or what ? Oh , you 're not going to be that lucky . That 's not funny . Sorry . Uh , the Ebola shows up around 14 hours after exposure , so ... Okay , and where are you ? Almost there . Almost what , dad ? Another 10 , maybe 9 hours , we 'll know for sure . Whether you 're going to like , live or die or whatever , I guess . Yeah . So , uh ... are you scared or ... ? Lilith , I want you to go home to your mom , okay ? That is so fucked up . Lilith , I don 't want to argue about this . You could be dying and all you have to say to me is go home to your mum 's ? I don 't know what you want me to say ! You want me to tell you that I 'm going to be all right ? You want me to lie to you ? I don 't know ! I don 't know . Well , okay then . Uh , I have my cell phone so ... I guess if I don 't hear from you then I 'll ... No , no . Lilith . Is that his blood ? As much as he 'd give me . Yeah , not your model patient type . David Sandstrom in a quarantine box . What do you think ? I want a full sweep . Any sign of tissue factor , I want to know it . And if there is a sign ? We do everything we can , Mayko . " This is my near death experience . " What have I learned ? Nothing . What am I feeling ? Nothing . " What am I thinking ? Nothing . What the fuck is wrong with me ? " Everything . Now , I had to guess . Size 16 shirt , 32x32 pants , boxers I would imagine , medium . Size 9 shoe . Did I get it right ? No deadly virus floating in those veins , David . I was just getting used to being dead . Well , you 're all clear . I 've seen worse ... and I 've worn worse . You really had me scared , David . All of us . You think I 'm an asshole , right ? I 'd do it all over again . She needed to know the truth , Caroline . She needed to kill her baby ? You don 't understand . The Institute Pasteur in Paris has done extensive work on Ebola . - They need to be brought into this . - Not going to happen , Carlos . Why in God 's name would you not want all the help that you can get ? Two words : National Security . Look , if I 'm going to sell them , you 're going to have to sell me . Let me show you something . Mayko , put up the Ebola MS data . This is the sequence of the virus the baby was carrying . It 's totally repetitive . The genome must be completely unstable . Look , there and there . It 's weird . And the Ebola proteins keep changing . The virus seems to be recombining at an extremely high frequency . What are you saying ? It 's evolving ? Exactly , and we 're fighting to keep up with it . So , you get it ? We can 't neutralize something until - we know what we 're going after . - And how soon will that be ? Depends on how many labs we have working on it . Look , I 'll see what I can do . In the meantime , this thing , the research data , nothing leaves this lab until I say so . How 's she doing ? She hasn 't eaten . She 's on a protryptaline drip . Oh , I 'll take that . Remember me ? You know , you really ought to eat something . Daisy , what happened to you , to Miranda ... It wasn 't your fault . We 're going to find out who did this . I swear to you . I mean , you 're ... You 're going to walk out of here and everything 's going to be okay . So , will you- - - Hey . - Hey . So , you 're okay ? Uh , you got the car keys ? You have to be on the list . Hey , you were here the other day . Uh , yes sir . Dr. Sandstrom was running some tests on me . I just wanted to know if he had any results yet . Sure , it 's okay . You want to come in the lab ? - Is Dr. Sandstrom there ? - No , he 's on his way . Come on in . I 've been running those tests on you . So , I was right , wasn 't I ? I 'm a scientist , Mick . I have to believe in science fact , not science fiction . You don 't believe me ? - ' 90 right ? You were born in 1990 ? - Yeah . Well , back then cloning an embryonic cell by nuclear transfer was just not ... just not possible . Briggs King cloned a frog in 1952 and Dr. Bromhall cloned a rabbit in 1975 . Well yes , but ... Are they teaching that in school already ? No , my dad talks about that stuff all the time . Have you ever heard of a Dr. Shelby Sloane ? That 's your father ? He wrote the bible on reductionism in genetics . Yeah . Yeah , well then he probably told you that Briggs Kings ' frog didn 't survive and the rabbits ended up as mutants . It was a step closer , but ... No , no , you can 't be a clone . I am ! I have to be ! Yeah , okay , sure . Look , I know what you 're thinking . I 'm not a twin . Okay . Okay ... Right . So , what I 'd like to do is take some blood . Run a couple more tests . Are you good with that ? What 's wrong with this test ? You know how to interpret a DNA sequence ? Sure you do , your dad taught you , didn 't he ? Well , this one 's not right . I need to do it over . Fine . Have a seat , I 'll be right back . And don 't touch anything . Just ... Okay . I don 't see any difference . They must be twins . Not according to their birth certificates . They were born 2 years apart . Ooh , then that 's what I call a long labour . I 'm up to 27 VNTR loci . Isn 't that a little overkill , Bob ? Sure , but I know I 'll find some differences in the DNA eventually . Hey , you guys hear about this guy ? He says he 's using Jesus Christ 's DNA to resurrect him . " Indeed it is . The scriptures prophesied the return of Christ . " They never prophesied how or when . " Turn it off , Mayko . Ever hear David weigh in on this guy ? Oh , let me guess . He doesn 't believe him . No shit . David thinks I rushed the sequencing . Made a mistake . Sequenced the same DNA twice . I don 't make mistakes . - Then somebody made a clone . - 15 years ago ? They didn 't even have iPods . I must have screwed up somewhere . - Hello . - Hey , what 's going on ? - You 're out . - I 'm out . Are you covered in poxes or what ? - Funny . Is Carlos there ? - Yeah , hold on . Hola , David . You get anything back from Paris about the virus ? Uh , it didn 't go to Paris . - Say again . - Security . Jesus Christ . Is Hira on it ? - She 's been locked out , David . - What do you mean , locked out ? Caroline seems to think there could be an issue with her clearance . - She does ? - Oh , for fuck sakes , where 's Caroline ? Get her on the phone ! - I haven 't seen her all morning . - Find her ! It 's good to have you back , David . You 'll get over that in a day or two . Hira , you 're employed by a lab that handles everything from toxic mould to P-strain 872 , where- - Don 't patronize me , Caroline . I know what it is . Do you recognize these men ? Some of them . This one ? My brother , Maura . This was taken at his 21st birthday party . Where did you get that ? - Do you recognize these men ? - No . You don 't recognize your brother ? I haven 't seen my brother for over 2 years . Well , this is what he looks like today . What does this have to do with me ? Did you know your brother 's a member of a terrorist organization known as Jaish-e-Mohammed ? The Army of Mohammed . Are you a member of The Army of Mohammed ? I can 't believe you would ask me that . Do you recognize these emails ? Where are you going with this , Caroline ? I had them translated . " My beloved sister , Hira . What you told me about Brucellosis wasn 't enough . I need more . " Why were you writing to your brother about it ? My brother is a good man . He 's just your- - He 's part of an organization that 's responsible for suicide attacks against the Indian parliament ! That 's a lie . I don 't believe my brother has anything to do with that . What other information did you share with him ? With Jaish-e-Mohammed ? Why are you acting as if I did ? Hira , this is why you 're down here . This is why you 're locked out of the lab . Excuse me , are you Dr. Sandstrom ? I might be . Peter Madden , IPN News . I just wanted to get you comments on what 's going on- - No , no . Look , I don 't do PR , okay . Now for the moment , the epidemic has been contained , World Health is going to contact- - - No . - You guys if there 's any updates on- - We just wanted to get your reaction on this cloning of Christ business . You got to be kidding me , right ? You 're aware of the work the Reverend Steven Walsh is doing ? Believe me , I have got better things to do . You know the guy 's a con artist , right ? Then you don 't think it 's possible to clone something from a smear of ancient blood . Come on ! Dr. Sandstrom , theoretically speaking , isn 't there some scientific basis- - Could somebody come down please and let me into my fucking lab ! ... to what Dr. Walsh is doing with his team of researchers . Reverend Walsh theoretically could be telling the truth . Okay , sure ! Theoretically ... if you by some believable way ... could secure viable genetic material from some ancient source ... It 's possible , theoretically that you could ... You know , extract the DNA . But that doesn 't mean that you ... Don 't you have a parade or something you should be covering ? What was that all about ? Ignorance . Who changed the codes to the front door ? Who do you think ? No , mum . Dad actually wants me to stay . No , I 'm not lying to you . Yeah , and what about school ? Yes , I know I have to go . Yeah ... I got it ... I don 't know , okay , but I 'll figure it out ... No ! Yeah , all right , fine . I 'll get him to call you . Bye . Hey , what 's up ? I 've got proof . I mean , I saw it . Yeah , you saw what ? Is your dad here ? Lilith , my DNA is exactly like my brother 's . I saw it . Okay . It was identical . So , what ? What ? That makes you a clone ? Yes ! Your dad 's got to believe me now . I mean , he 'll want a study . Yeah , I guess . No , he 's a scientist and I 'm a messed up experiment and he 's going to want to fix me . He 'll have to , won 't he ? I don 't know . Like ... I don 't know when he 's going to be home or whatever , but you can like , stay . I should probably get going . My dad 's going to start- - Your dad ... What ... Do you do everything this guy wants ? I 'm not sure I do anything he wants . Do you want something to drink ? Yeah , sure . We 've got champagne . I don 't drink champagne . Yeah , yeah , I know you 're right . It 's too gay . Uh , there 's tequila and margarita mix . Oh , no . I don 't drink alcohol ... in general . Oh . It 's 3 : 00 . I mean , it 's a pretty good time to start , right ? Okay , sure . Are ... Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Cool , okay . Sure . What do you know about this Walsh guy ? Just what I hear on the news , and we know they never lie . - The whole thing 's a scam . - Oh , I don 't know . He did prove he got the nail from the hill - where Jesus was crucified . - He proved that , did he ? Do you know how many people got nailed on that hill ? Okay , what about the DNA match from the blood on the nail to the blood in that chapel in Belgium ? What are you talking about ? It was on the news last night . Some place in Belgium , they got a vial of Christ 's blood , like in a shrine . Oh sure , yeah , I believe that . - Okay , just say they do . - No . You know as well as I do that you can reconstruct the degraded DNA off the nail through the genome gathering- - You know what ? I 'm sorry I brought it up . Even if Walsh is David Blaine with a crucifix , that doesn 't mean he didn 't hook up with somebody really smart . Maybe there 's a genetic researcher out there who 's way ahead of the curve . More ahead of the curve than I am ? I know . It boggles the mind . - Hi . - In a minute , Bob . I do need to talk to you about this DNA . Bob .. ! Where 's Hira ? At the moment , she 's a security risk . I don 't think she should be here . Oh , you don 't think she should be here . Okay , let me get this straight . We have got some asshole out there using babies as Ebola factories , and I 'm losing my chief virologist . I 'll try to get her cleared as soon as possible , okay ? David , do you know there are 3 vials of recombinant salmonella unaccounted for in this lab ? Well , did you check the freezer ? I think I saw them in there next to Jimmy Hoffa 's body . What 's your point , Caroline ? Things get misplaced around here all the time . Not anymore . Do you know Hira has a brother who 's a member of a terrorist cell in Pakistan ? Coincidence ? You think she took them ? You think Hira gave salmonella to a terrorist group ? David , I 've never questioned your judgement when it comes to the science in this lab . Don 't question mine when it comes to security . - I want her back . - So do I. When I 'm satisfied she works for us , not for whoever else is out there . Bullshit . Is now a good time ? Oh Jesus , Bob . What ? I don 't think I made a mistake on the DNA samples from Mick and his brother . - Well , then you did the test too fast . - You told me to . We all make mistakes . Then I made the same mistake again . I got a new sample . See , so far it 's identical to the first sample . I didn 't make a mistake , David . Don 't lose it on me . Do you have any idea what you 're saying ? - I 'm just looking at the data . - I don 't care about the data . There 's no way somebody cloned a human being 15 years ago . You know his father 's Shelby Sloane ? Yeah , I talked to him . He thinks his kid 's nuts . Carlos ! - Have you seen this ? - I have . Any way Sloan could have pulled a clone out of his hat 15 years ago ? - No . - What have we got here ? I 'd say we 're missing some part of the equation . I 'll keep looking for something different in the DNA . If you want to be really sure , we 'd have to run the full sequence . The complete genome ? On both of them ? There 's no way . It would take 6 months and easily cost 2 million per kid . I know ! I know ! I know ! Goddamn it ! Okay , we 're asking the wrong questions here . Is he a clone or not , fuck that , there 's no way . So , what 's the thing ? The thing is ... The thing is ... Why would Sloan need a copy ? Why would Sloan need as close of a copy as he could get ? It makes ... Brother ... Why would he ? What did he die of ? - Mick 's brother , uh ... - Cal . Yeah , Cal . What killed him ? - Osteosarcoma . - Bone marrow cancer . That 's good , that 's good . It depends how you look at it . No , this is it . This is it . Okay ... we 're going to look at those samples and we 're going run PCR tests on them . I want you to focus on gene CF-268 , - It 's on chromosome 9 . - CF-268 . Exactly , we 're going to look for that gene that causes bone cancer . We 're going to look for it in both samples , and if we find that it 's mutated in Cal but not in Mick , we got what we 're looking for . - We 'll look . - All right . Where are you going ? I 'm going to go find out why we 're one PhD short around here . David , you 're okay . It was just the Ebola virus . Can we talk ? You look good . Ah , thank you . What 's going on ? I figured Caroline would have filled you in by now . Yeah , she told me one of your brothers belonged to an extremist group in Pakistan . That 's about it . I 'm on your side here . You 've got to know that . She found some emails I wrote to my brother . He wanted to know how to make Brucellosis . That 's a dirty little bug . You didn 't tell him , did you ? - Of course not . - I 'm just asking . I told him how dangerous a bacterium like Brucellosis was , how easily it could spread . And you mentioned all this to Caroline ? She wanted something more from me . Was there more ? Yeah ... I was approached by the Pakistani military . They offered me my own lab in Karachi . Well , why wouldn 't they ? You 're a brilliant scientist . What 's the issue here ? At the time I was working for the U.S. Defence Department . The Pakistanis wanted me to work on the same biologal warfare agents I was working on there . Tularemia , Botulinum toxin . They wanted me to deliver them . Steal the bio-agents I was working on . But you didn 't , right ? I thought about it , David . India had a biological weapons program , Pakistan wanted one . Best defence : Mutually assured destruction . Jesus . All right . Did you give them anything , and I mean anything at all ? No . And you told all this to Caroline ? Yes . She didn 't believe you . She sent someone to interrogate my parents . Okay , so I 'll pick you up tomorrow morning at 8 : 00 . No , David I can 't . I 'm locked out ! I know you can handle this , all right ? I know you 're smart and I know you 're strong but I am a selfish little brat who wants his best virologist in his lab tomorrow morning . - And Caroline ? - Ah Caroline-Smaroline . We 'll deal with Caroline ... Somehow ... Together . Okay ? Okay . " It 's identical to the first sample . " When I 'm satisfied she works for us . " Maybe there 's a genetic researcher out there who 's way ahead of the curve ? " They were born 2 years apart . " Sure , theoretically ! " If you by some ... believable way could secure " viable genetic material from some ancient source ... " It 's possible theoretically that you could- - " Dr. Sandstrom , a renowned microbiologist here in Toronto lending credence- - " Aw , Jesus Christ ! " ... extraordinary possibility that the Christ child could indeed be cloned . " What ? - Where are you ? - I don 't really know . You were right , David . Mick doesn 't have it . Somebody fixed gene CF-268 . That son of a bitch . Listen , Mayko wants to speak to you . Put her on . You been listening to the radio ? Unfortunately . That sound byte just made you Walsh 's best friend . You know what , Mayko ? I want you to do me a favour . Get in touch with Walsh 's people , tell them I 'll give them a fair hearing . Meaning what ? Meaning I 'll test their goddamn icon and I will announce the results no matter what they are . Aren 't you in deep enough ? If I 'm wrong , may lightening strike me dead . Was it like vitamins and everything ? Not really . What are you thinking about ? Nothing . My dad I guess . Ha ! No offence , but he is like , a real dick . Sometimes ... I wonder if he can 't talk to me because he doesn 't think I 'm real . You 're real , Mick . No , I mean real like his son . Cal was always , you know like , the sick one , the one that needed to be saved . And I was always ... I don 't know , like some kind of lab experiment . You 're not a lab experiment ! I was just made to save my brother and now he 's gone . Then what difference does it make if I 'm dead or alive ? Yeah , that 's really fucked up . I know . So am I. It 's been some time . Ten years , Tampa . The Hyatt Convention Hall . You stood up and publicly challenged my direction in the Human Genome Project . Yeah , well . Old school , new school , I wasn 't the only one . No , just the loudest . To what do I owe the honour of this intrusion ? Well , Dr. Sloane , I just want to know , how did you manage to manipulate the genetic code of a human embryo ? Okay , you want to know what I think ? - Do I have a choice ? - I think Mick was in-vitro . Thousands of babies were conceived that way . No , no . Not 15 years ago . You have no idea what I was capable of 15 years ago . I 'm starting to believe that you were able to get a fertilized human egg , get into it and manipulate the DNA . Before the human genome was mapped ? Oh , I know . That 's what 's so goddamn brilliant about it . I mean , somehow you were able to find the mutant bone marrow cancer gene in Mick , and replace it with a normal one . You did , didn 't you ? Like I said , you have no idea what I was capable of back then . It 's brilliant , Sloane . It 's goddamn brilliant ! It 's just unfortunate that you had to jettison a lot of excess baggage to get there . I 'm talking about your son . My son ? It was all about my son . All of it . I wasn 't going to wait for God to give me a miracle . I knew how to make my own . It was goddamn brilliant . I was seeing things no one had ever seen before . A whole new frontier of science . Wait a minute , you 're talking about Cal ? You 're goddamn right , I 'm talking about Cal , he was dying ! While the rest of you were imagining the impossible , I was doing it ! - You were doing it all right . - Fucking right ! You think any great advances would ever have been made if it had been left to a bunch of second-guessing cowards ? Well , you certainly weren 't that ! I guess sacrifices had to be made , right ? - You know nothing about sacrifice . - Well , Mick does . And he 's going around saying he 's a goddamn clone , but it 's worse than that . He 's Cal 's twin . And you stick him in a freezer for 2 years so what ? So , if something goes wrong with Cal , you can thaw him out , mess with his DNA and use him for spare fucking parts ? I mean Jesus ! That 's why he 's dying now , you son of a bitch ! I know he 's dying ! You think I don 't know that ? Look , I 'm sorry . I didn 't come over here to ... I want to help . It 's so easy for you to judge me , isn 't it ? Tell me , what would you have done , Dr. Sandstrom ? Would you have just ... Sat back and watched your child die ? I 've done everything ... Everything scientifically possible . You can 't help us . No one can . It 's too late . When I was like , 3 ... My parents , they got divorced and my mom , she took me out West ... and I never saw my dad . Or like hardly ever . And , whenever I did , he was way too busy to ... to even notice me . Yeah . You 're there , but you 're not there . Yeah , exactly . It was like that when ... when my brother died . I knew he was there , I knew he was with me in my room . I knew he was there and I knew that he had died . You know the weird thing though ? If it weren 't for him , I wouldn 't be alive . I mean , I wouldn 't be dying . It 's not like I 'm afraid to die or anything , you know . I just want to live my life . I know . Oh , did I fall asleep ? Come on , let me help you to your room . No , I 'm fine . I 'm fine here . Are you all right ? Sure . Then why you have to fight ? I 've spent my whole life fighting . To go to school . To learn the things I 've learned . To make a mark in my field . I won 't let them take that away . It won 't happen , dad . " So , how great is this town ? " In the last year , we got SARS , a black-out and ... " I 've got a little jock itch . " And what about that last Ebola thing , was that freaky or what ? " You know , it 's kind of a relief this Walsh guy - you heard about him ? " This guy , the Reverend Stephen Walsh is cloning Jesus Christ . " Yeah , I think I 'm signing up for my own personal one of those . " Yeah , cheap wine out of water . Heals me when I get sick . " Christ : The perfect gift for the guy who 's got everything ! " Hey . Did you have a nice night ? Yeah . Are you expecting somebody ? No . Fifteen years of disappointments . If there 's a miracle in there , maybe you can find it . Come in . No , I can 't . Mick isn 't at home . So ... He 's here , Dr. Sloane . I see . Look , Mick 's scared . He 's all alone , he has no one to talk to and he sure as hell can 't talk to you . I 'm sorry . - It 's okay , dad . - No , it 's not okay . It 's never been okay . You 're entitled to the truth , Mick . What I did , I did out of love for your brother , love for you , for the healthy son I hoped you 'd be . Sorry I didn 't live up to your expectations . Oh ... Mick , if I ... If I had half your character , your strength ! I 'm the one who didn 't live up to his promise ! As a man , as a scientist , as a father ! The truth is that I created one son to save another . I never thought I would fail . I never thought about the consequences . Let 's just go , dad . Mick ... Uh ... Call me or ... Goodbye , Dr. Sandstrom . Dad , just ... Tell me you can help him . I don 't know . Ah ! ... Yeah , you can ! I mean , of course you can . You 're Dr ... Lilith , the odds are he is beyond anybody 's help . I 'm just telling you the truth . I 'm sorry . Not only has Dr. David Sandstrom acknowledged the possibility of our miraculous cloning of Jesus , but he said he would prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt . Hey , did you check out what 's going on out there ? Some kind of demonstration . David 's not going to like it . When are we going to see some evidence of your claims ? They 're more than just claims , young lady . We are entering a great new age of enlightenment and the return of Christ is only the beginning . Are you ready for this ? I don 't know . Could you just lie and say : " Yeah , I 'm great David , there 's nothing to worry about . I just know you are going to kick Caroline 's ass , if she gets in my face . " No . I can 't say that . Could you at least think it ? What ? David , I did some preliminary test on the scraping we got from Reverend Walsh . Yeah , on the nail . Okay . Yeah , it 's a really degraded mess . Of course it is , Bob . What do you want me to do ? Sequence the genes we use to to test for somebody 's racial background . - Let 's really pick this thing apart . - Sure . Oh , and one more- - ... thing . Dr. Sandstrom will no doubt affirm what we already know- - - Shit . - the nail is authentic . David , let 's just go in the back . Oh no , no , no . We are not going in the back door of our own lab . The blood . The DNA matches known samples of Christ 's blood . That 's a lie Walsh and you know it ! - I don 't think he heard you . - He doesn 't want to hear me . Furthermore , the blood traces taken from the nail , from which we cloned the Christ child have been genetically broken down by 4 independent labs . Now what labs ? Where 's your documentation ? Is that it ? They show the blood to be that of a man . A man with the genetic characteristics of a Semite . Come one , a lab told you that ? How much are you paying them Walsh ? No ! Next time on ReGenesis ... - Hira 's dead , David ! - Yes , she 's dead . Got it ! I 've got to get out of here . Yeah , when Burillsky went through the boards ? - They 're the biggest . - Oh , man , you 're not ... We have a situation developing in the US related to a prion type disease . Mad cow . - Bullshit ! - I 'm sorry ? It takes at least 7 years for a prion protein to fuck up the brain , and then at least another year after that before you die . Sarah McKinley , Tampa , Florida , 5 years old . And how are they getting it ? How are they getting it ? Your accreditation means a great deal to all of us involved . - Really , what 's a great deal ? - Say ... $ 100,000 . Subtitles : kubilai Lama Transcript : Raceman

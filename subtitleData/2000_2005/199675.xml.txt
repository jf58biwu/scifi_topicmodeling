Welcome to today 's match-up between Bates Bulldogs and the Carlin Devils . It 's the first game for both teams as the Bulldogs seek their 7th championship . There 's a history of bad blood between these teams as the Devils have consistently been a thorn in the Bulldogs ' side . Let 's hope the Dawgs can pull that thorn out once and for all as the special teams get set for the opening kick-off . Number 42 of the Bulldogs , Chuck Potter , receiving the kick . Oh , my ! He 's popped ! could I have my purse , please ? Oh . Just about five minutes to go now in the second quarter . A vicious hit by Stark . Johnson , number 45 , isn 't getting up . - What kind of call was that ? - lt looks like number 33 , Stark , is being ejected for a flagrant personal foul . What the hell is he fuckin ' doingg ? - That was not a fIaggrant foul ! - 33 has been disqualified . Why don 't I just take every starter out for you ! Touchdown , Devils ! The Bulldogs are trailing in the second half as they receive the Devils 'punt . Number 42 , Chuck Potter , takes the kick again for the Dawgs . And there he goes cutting across the field , racing down the sideline ! Fourth quarter action . Here 's the snap . A quick pass to Jesse Ryan , and , oooh , he was hit hard ! What a pop ! He is down . He is not getting up right away . Wait a minute. I see ... I see movement . Yes , he 's finally moving now . He 's up . Shaking it off . And there he goes . Everythingg 's so different , so very different . Thinggs changge . There 's Mr bellows . hello , Georgge ! He always had an eye for me . - Where ? - Rigght there . hello , Georgge ! devils suck ! It 's pretty much do-or-die time now . The Dawgs down by 4 , with 12 seconds left on the clock . It 's been a struggle for the Dawgs , trying to move the ball against the stingy Devils defence . This is not how the Dawgs wanted it to come out . They 've had a tough time on defence . - They 're not moving the ball as usual . - Ryan , come here . AII rigght , son , trips rigght , crazy eigght . Let 's ggo . They 're taking their time here . Probably their last play of the game . Trips rigght , crazy eigght . Go ! Go , BuIIdoggs !

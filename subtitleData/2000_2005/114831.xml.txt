 Season 4 - Episode 12 by joke0 K5 Shatner 's log : Airdate : unknown . The impossible has happened . It would take days to recount the event 's I 've witnessed . So , settle in . It all began ... Quiet you ! This court martial is now in session ! The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing . Bring in the accused ! Oh my ! Phillip J. Fry . You stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet Omega 3 , a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences . You understand the charges ? 1 beep for " Yes " , 2 beeps for " No " , " Yes " , so noted . Do you plead guilty ? Double " Yes " . Guilty ! I will now carry out the sentences . - Kif , my gun . - Wait ! He plead not guilty . Order ! Order in the court ! Very well then Mr Fry . Please recount the events that lead you to be guilty . The Professor said he was taking a brief nap , so we only have time for 6 movies . Lets take these 6 Jim Carrey movies and record over them . You know what 6 movies average out to be really good ? The first six Star Trek movies ! Everybody hit the deck ! Those words are forbidden ! Quels mots ? Star Trek ? Shut your gills ! That sound ! Patrol Car 718 ! Hide him ! The court is intrigued . Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words , from someone with a sexilly seductive voice . With pleasure . You see the show was banned after the Star Trek wars . You mean after the vast migration of Star Wars fans ? No , that was the Star Wars trek . By the 23rd Century Star Trek fandom had evolved ... from the loose assosciation of nerds with skin problems into a full blown religion . " And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all . " " All power to the engines . " As country after country fell under its influence , world leaders became threatened by the movement 's power . And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins . He 's dead Jim ! Finally , the sacred texts were banned .. The last copies of the 79 episodes and 6 movies were dumped on the forbidden world Omega 3 . Along with that blooper reel where the door doesn 't close all the way . Last , Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory . Another classic Science-Fiction show cancelled before its time . I 've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about . Next witness ! Will Bender the robot please take the stand . She 's all yours buddy ! I 'd only met the defendant Fry once , but I knew he was up to no good . Please use the beeps . Mr Nimoy . I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago . I can 't believe your show was banned . I have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . You know . 1966 , 79 episodes , about 30 good ones . Oh really , I 've done too many things to remember one particular TV series . But if you want to discuss my books of poetry ... C 'mon ! Remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked Kirk around ? No . Perhaps you 're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock . I mean Van Gogh ! Damn ! You can 't escape it ! Oh you 're right I can 't . Jeez , don 't get upset . I mean , OK I outwitted you but ... No , it 's my fellow cast members . 300 years ago they left Earth behind . This planet doesn 't appreciate us anymore , Leonard . Bill , you are , and always shall be , my friend . But I just signed a 6 month lease on my apartment . I can 't walk away from a commitment like that . Very well my friend . Why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness ? I 'm literally angry with rage ! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see ! Come on ! Yesss ! Front row ! You can 't go to Omega 3 ! It 's forbidden , I forbid you ! But we have to . The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future . But it 's set 800 years in the past ! Yeah , why is this so important to you ? 'cause it , it taught me so much . Like how you should accept people . Whether they be black , white , Klingon or even female . But most importantly , when I didn 't have any friends ... it made me feel like maybe I did . Well , that is touchingly pathetic . I guess I can 't let you go alone . I 'll go too . With Leonard 's permission of course . We 're entering the Omega system . Warning : You are now in forbidden space . Forbidden shmershmidden ! What are they gonna do ? Write a letter ? I 'm so scared ! I 've lost control of the ship ! Dip ! Dip indeed ! It 's all stuff from that forbidden show . So many cardboard sets , so many memories . - If only the others ... - I guess thats my cue . Bill ! Eldo ! - This is wonderful ! - Oh man . I feel like hugging you . Well I would but you have no body ! And we 're both men . Nichelle ! George ! Walter ! DeForest ! Welshey ! Welshey ? We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200 's , but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling . Ever since then , Welshey has been a welcome participant in our escapades . I can 't believe it ! How 'd you all end up here ? We were on our way to Welshey 's cousin 's house to stay in the guest room , when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed . Just like yours . When we woke up , we had these bodies . Say it in Russian ! Ven ve voke up ve had these wodies . - Now say nuclear wessels ! - No ! You 'll love it here ! Everything is provided for us . And we never age . Check out these abs . But who 's doing all this for you ? You know we never thought about it . We 're famous celebrities we 're used to this sort of treatment . It is I ! What a cheesy effect ! I am not an effect ! You doubt my power ? I do ! Welsheeeeeeeey ! This court will now hear some very sensual testemony ... from this court 's ex lover , Turanga Leela . Go [ beep ] yourself . Behold another power , different from the one you saw earlier . Hey ! A body ! Buff , tanned . Yeah , this is mine alright ! Alright you gas ! What 's the deal ? Centuries ago , the videotaped adventures ... of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet . Over and over I watched them . Especially the 5 with the energy beings . I am Melllvar ! Seer of the tapes ! Knower of the episodes ! Tremble before my encyclopeadic knowledge of Star Trek ! Tremble ? I laugh . No one knows more about Star Trek than me ! I beg to differ . Long have I waited for the one who played Spock . At last , we can begin . Cool ! A Star Trek convention ! Melllvar can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last ? Until time stops . You can 't do this ! Now , we have a full schedule of events ... Can people who hate Star Trek leave ? Good question ! No you have to stay even longer . Sign it to Melllvar . Melllvar has three I 's . I think I 've done enough conventions to know how to spell " Melllvar " . Say " nerd " ! Nerd ! I 'm ... Slim Shady . Yes . I 'm the real Shady . All you other Slim Shady 's ... are just imitating . So ... won 't the real Slim Shady ... please stand up ... please stand up ... please stand up ow can you do a spoken word version of a rap song ? He found a way . For one hundred quatloos ... Who did the Captain Maroon on Ceti Alpha V ? Khaaan ! - Khan ? - Correct . My button has broken . The trivia contest has ended . I now have a surprise . You will perform a fan script , written by the ultimate Trek fan . You have my fan script ? I meant me ! Melllvar is the ultimate fan ! I was confused because the scoreboard says something different ! Trivia contest over ! Take your scripts ! We have limited rehearsal time . I didn 't make enough copies of the script so , George and Walter will have to share . You probably don 't want us to see you rehearsing or it 'll give away the ending . That 's right ! The ending must not be ruined ! We 'll go wait in the ship . OK . Not until I get my 600 quatloos . This is wrong . We shouldn 't have abandoned them there . I dunno . I 'm feeling pretty good about it . I didn 't want to leave them either Fry , but what are we supposed to do ? Well , usually on the show , someone would come up with a complicated plan , then explain it with a simple analogy . If we can reroute engine power through the primary weapons , and ... reconfigure them to Melllvar 's frequency ... that should overload his electro-quantum structure .. Like putting too much air in a ballon ! Of course ! It 's so simple ! Alas ... my ship ... whom I love like a woman ... is ... disabled . Oh Lord ! Fascinating , Captain , and logical too . We need some help . Look , captain . Melllvar will help us . Keptin , I wope he vill help our ... vessel . Wessel ! You 're not acting hard enough ! Melllvar , you have to respect your actors . When I was directing Star Trek IV , I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much . And when I directed Star Trek V , I got a magnificent performance out of me ... because I respected me so much ! OK ! I 'm done rekafoobling the energy motron . Or , whatever . Fire ! My , what a handsome energy creature you are . I love you . Hey you wrote it ! Its not working . He 's drawing straight from our weapons . Like a balloon when ... something bad happens . So uh , how 's rehearsal going ? Lousy . Here I 've been admiring a bunch of actors while you , a crew of genuine space heroes , risked your lives to save them . Hey ! We 've done heroic things too ! Yeah ! In the third season I kissed Shatner ! Silence ! My whole world has turned upside down . I have but one option . - Keep them and let us go ? - No ! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion ... I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat . To the death ! Where 'd you get an idiotic idea like that ? Episodes 19 , 46 , 56 and 77 . Great list . Except , you forgot episode 66 ! I was getting to that one ! So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death . I assume no one survived . Can we get on with this ? My foot 's getting tired ! This will be a standard battle to the death . The only weapons : whatever you can find . But I warn you : do nothing until I signal the start of combat ! OK start . I don 't have much experience of fighting . Except with you guys . I have an idea . Wasn 't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy ? You mean Doohan ? Whoever it was , I did it like this . My foot 's cold ! There . We can make these into spears . And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows . And we can use this machine gun to shoot them ! That was fun ! What if I distract them with my famous fan dance ? Oh yes good good good good . And the George , you give them a karate chop ! I find that offensive . Just because I 'm of Japanese ancestry , you assume I know karate . Have I ever lead you to belive I 've studied karate ? Well no , but you never talk about yourself . Maybe if you showed a little interest . Well . Here goes nothing . Hello boys ! There 's no right way to hit a woman . - Then do it the wrong way . - Fine . Is that all you 've got ? - Come on Walter ! - Take that ! That hurts ! Lets see if this actually works ! My face ! My face too ! May I ? Excellent ! Excellent ! Leela , please . This is exactly what Melllvar wants . We 're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers . Can 't we resolve our differences in some other way ? Melllvar ! Dinnertime ! But mom ! I 'm playing with my collectables ! Now ! All this time we thought he was a powerful superbeing , when he was just a child . He 's not a child , he 's 34 ! All right Koenig , I 've wanted to do this for years ! Bender wait ! This is our chance to escape , before Melllvar comes back . But we all need to work together . We 've decided to work together . Hmm , so did they . Now , how do we escape ? We can 't use our ship . The life support works but the engines are wrecked . Ironic . Because our engines work , but our life support systems don 't . Hey , if your engines work and your life support systems work ... Stop ! You 're just goin ' around in circles ! Think Fry , think ! Everyone 's depending on you . We 're too heavy . You guys need to lose some weight . Fast ! Look Leonard ! We 're light enough to keep the tapes ! Isn 't that great ? I 'm living in a cafilterfish jar . We did it ! Melllvar 's got a spaceship ! Yes in mint condition . And you made me take it out of the package ! The Nimbus ! We 're saved ! You 're under arrest . Prepare to be boarded . So I boarded you then . What happened next ? You started this stupid court martial . Now if you don 't mind we 're still fighting Melllvar ! One more hit and we 're done for ! Let 's take them out with us . Do you guys have a self destruct code ? Like destruct sequence 1A2B3 ... Thanks a lot Takei , now everybody knows ! If I can 't have the original cast of Star Trek , no one will ! - Prepare to die ! - Wait ! If they mean that much to you , why do you wanna kill them ? Because I ... I ... I dunno what I 'd do without them . Melllvar , you can 't let a TV show be your whole life . You can do anything you want . Look at Walter Koenig . After Star Trek , he became an actor ! Not just an actor , but a well rounded person . With my own friends , credit cards , keys . Well I guess I could move out of my parents ' basement ... maybe get a temp job . One step at a time . I thank you Fry . You know , you and I are of a kind . In a different reality I could have called you " friend " . Episode 10 , " Balance of Terror " . More like episode 9 , loser ! In your face ! Victory is mine ! I wonder my friends , was he really such an evil energy gas ? He did give us eternal youth . 24 hour laundromat . A full assortment of rum both spiced and regular . Truly , he was a paradise . And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan . Let 's get the hell outta here ! June 08th , 2003 - v2

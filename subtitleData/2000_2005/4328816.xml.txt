 Cool . Mad cool . Doof doof doof-doof doof . Don 't think you 're invincible . It 's just a web launcher . - Are you ready for this ? - Give me a minute . What are you doing ? Cleansing breath . It 's part of my positive visualisation technique . Really ? Visualise this . Aaarrgh ! - Help me ! - No rescue this time . If you want to hang with us , you fly with us . No ! Aaaagh ! Don 't let them take me . Help me . MAN : Don 't take her ! Daddy . Ready to try your web launcher ? Here goes nothing . Let me go ! Jinasta ! Incompetent fools ! Aaargh ! Watch out ! That girl 's in trouble . Help me ! There they are . Let 's get them . Aaargh ! - Do you know these guys ? - They 're shooting . That 's all I need to know . We 've got to let them pass us . - Reverse ! - Reverse ? ! How do we reverse ? All clear . I think we got most of them . Yeah , but they got the girl . 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth We took out the better part of their forces . I don 't think they 'll bother you again . You don 't understand . They were Mordecis . - Mordecis ? - Mutants from the lower levels . They come to harvest specimens to sell to mutant experimental labs . She 'd be better off dead . Oh , it 's not that bad . - You 've got the three of us on the case now . - You can get her back ? - Of course we can . - No ! We ... I 'm sorry . It 's a terrible loss . - Being a hero isn 't just saying I 'm sorry . - Who said we were heroes ? Well , not me . Real heroes wouldn 't be afraid to help this man . OK . Maybe afraid was the wrong choice of words . My bad . But this is still wrong . It 's not wrong . We 'll never retake the surface if we stop every five minutes to play hero . We get enough of that with you . Come on . This isn 't about me . Where I come from ... when I came from , whatever ... the good guys helped out people in trouble . We are the good guys , aren 't we ? Ask not what others can do for you , but what you can do for others . MAN : That 's beautiful . You can 't ignore a plea like that . Do you think of this stuff beforehand , or do you just make it up as you go ? It all comes from the heart . All right . Let 's do it . Let 's kick some mutant butt . Right ! We 'll get her back . Don 't you worry ! Now all we need is a plan . That 's right , team . We 're go-o-o-o ! No promises . But we 'll do our best . Futuristic techno No weapons or armour in the bar . You 're clean . What have you got to hide ? The scanner says you 've got a weapon . I think I 'll have to do a manual search . Maybe later . Nice . Go on . Thanks . Hel ... it 's been a while . Hey , hey . Yeah ! Too bad , Bet . But he 'll sell you to a standard mutant lab . At least I taught you about breeding with mutants , cos that 's all you 'll be doing . Well , surprised to see you here . Couldn 't stay away . What have you got to play for ? Check it out . There she is . Good . What ? No boys ? Say , are you in ? I 'm playing . She 's in the holding cell with the other specimens . Now all we have to do is get her out . Cleo . You 're on . Sweetheart , you 're doing it all wrong . It 's called a strip ... tease . Emphasis on the tease . And what do you think this pole is doing here ? Holding up the bar ? Clear me . Give me some room . That 's right . Showtime , boys . I know just where This is going Can 't you feel the music flowing ? Come on , baby , I know you want to - Dance with me - This should be good . Come on Don 't be so uptight I assure you I don 't bite I can 't wait to turn up all the lights Slide on over Next to me Got you sized up to a T Cos the oldest profession Just took on a whole new dimension with me Got a hundred different ways to go So , she went to school for that , then ? .. as long as we can take it real Slow Cos you can 't escape the simple fact Got the power to make your blood react Till your head is spinning round Well , whatever you call it , it 's working . Can 't fake it now Happy birthday , Mr Mutant . MUTANT : Yeah . Oh , yeah . Yeah ! Huh ? Oh , yeah ! All right ! Thank you ! Whoo ! So ... who wants to play me ... for her ? Too bad . No-one could pull off that move . You want to fold out ? Fold out ? I 'll double the bet . What are you doing ? Well it 's good to meet someone with the ... crystals to go for it . Let 's double . OK . OK . Bet your next move . Come on . Any takers ? Good . Keep playing like this , you 'll own the whole level . It 's getting crowded around this table . Why not send your specimen to the holding room ? No . You let your specimens speak for you ? Only when they know my mind . And I ... would like this one to stay . Thanks . I owe you one . Whoo ! A round of drinks for everyone at the table . On me . So ... what are you doing after the game ? It depends on who owns me . Oh , It 'll be Hel . BET : She 'd better be careful . These people don 't like to lose . This is bad . He could ruin everything . Don 't worry . I 've got it covered . - Excuse me , bartender . - What can I do for you ? Daddy ? ! Oh ! Oh ! I told you and Mommy not to worry about me ! You have to get out of here . Now . We have a plan . But if you say anything , you could ruin it . You trust this woman ? This Hel ? With my life . All right . But I believe they may have just slipped some juice into her goblet . She 's a big girl . She can handle it . All taken care of . Good . Good . Oh , by the way . While you were gone ? I lost you both . He was putty in my hands . He got all freaked out about them putting some juice in Hel 's cup . Juice is a nickname for a resistance inhibitor . It inhibits resistance to what ? Love . An aphrodisiac ? - Yeah . - Oh , my God . Yeah ! Oh , no . Houston , we have a problem . Who 's Houston ? Are you playing , or what ? Oh , I 'm playing . Whoo ! I bet she figured out they were putting juice in her glass and switched . What are you talking about ? Look how she 's behaving . It 's very common among amateurs . She 's way over the top . I can tell she 's acting . Bad roll . What a shame . That 's a loser for sure . But , you know , I always like to keep things interesting . Don 't you ? Why not ? Bet all your specimens . All of them . I 'm out . - Bye-bye . - What are you going to put up ? Hmm ... Oh ! My sweet ... sweet self . I 'm in . Good . Your turn . Give me five ! Release all the specimens ! - Jinasta ! - Daddy , Daddy , I 'm so glad to see you . Oh , my little girl ! Are you OK ? Oh ! Did you think we were going to let you walk away with your winnings ? You up-worlders are so naive . We can still take them . They had to check their weapons at the door too . They bribed me . Watch out ! Oh , Daddy ... We saved them because it was the right thing to do . Doesn 't it feel great ? Yeah . I guess . You know what ? Let 's go find us some real men . - All right ! - Mad cold . - Mad cool . - Yeah . Whatever . Hey , Hel . Have you got any more of that juice ? Next week : 104 Mind Games

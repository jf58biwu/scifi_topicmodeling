 What about Scorpius ? - What about him ? Well , he might have been captured . Harvey . You must go back for him . Aeryn : We 're going to walk into the most heavily guarded base in the Scarran Empire , start a civil war and walk out with Scorpius . What part of that do you not understand ? Why shouldn 't I just have you seized right now ? Well , maybe this . A fission bomb . My heart stops , we all go boom . He 's crazy . Isn 't it fun ? What am I offered for all the powers of the universe ? Give us wormhole weapons and everyone will be safe . Have you got anything to offer , or is all this just an elaborate bluff ? You don 't believe that I can control wormholes ? An entire cavern just to grow the flowers they eat . Why ? I 'm going to capture your soul . Scorpius can 't possibly hold out much longer . Rygel ? The Scarrans will never make you rich . How much hatred exists here between the Charrids and the Kalish ? Where the hell is my riot ? I will not be humiliated by you , Vakali . Will you betray me ? I 've served you for ten cycles as a spy . Don 't fire or you 'll detonate the bomb . You stupid son of a bitch ! I 'm sorry , John . And now on Farscape . ( yells ) Scorpius : You do not know what you 're doing . Yeah , I do and I 'm gonna freakin ' nuke you and half of this damn base . Scorpius : Kill me later . I should kill you now . You 're still my prisoner . Technically he 's my prisoner . - Thank you , John . When Aeryn wakes up , she gonna kill him ! Staleek : I 'm so pleased to see you 're all safe . Minister Ahkna 's forces have done a superb job in quelling the unrest . A duty to which I 'm sure she 's eager to return . See ya later , sweetheart . Thank you . Aeryn . Shh . Did we win ? You 'll be delighted to hear my guards were able to secure the rest of your crew as well . Coincidentally , as they were also nearing exits . Like yourselves , I 'm sure they were simply trying to avoid any entanglement in violence . - Where are they ? There are guards placed to ensure their wellbeing . ( beeping ) Were you planning to leave ? - Temporarily . Grayza called with another offer . But you had a riot going on . We didn 't wanna bother you . We decided to take our own car . I 'm glad you didn 't . Base defenses have been placed on highest alert . Any non-Scarran vessels will automatically be targeted and destroyed . We were very lucky . We 'll transport you to the Carrier . That 's very kind . My pleasure ... John . Jenek : Emperor , the craft is an Eradicator , Topraktin design . We 've gained entry and neutralized its systems . Sentinels are now securing the star charts and the vector logs . Leave no trace when you 've completed . I don 't want them to know what we know . - Sir . I prevented you from leaving for your own protection . You what ? - You stopped us from leaving ? You stuck a knife in our back . No . Your plan would have failed . We could have be on Lo 'La by now ... - Hear him out . Hear him out ! It is quite likely the Scarrans had already disabled D 'Argo 's ship . That 's impossible . And found Moya . Even if we manage to get off Katratzi , their base 's weapons would have destroyed us . Stealth is no longer an option . Does Lo 'La have enough firepower to blast us out ? Maybe . Probably . I don 't know . It 's worth a shot . Aeryn : How would we do it ? I 'd call Lo 'La , she 'd blast a hole and we 'd run through . Crichton : Do it before someone else screws us . Okay . ( speaks Luxan ) ( repeats Luxan words ) Somebody 's jammed the Comms . No , no , the Comms are working fine . They must have disabled Lo 'La . That is impossible . Hey , what about the Command Carrier ? Can we still get a free ride outta here ? Ahkna : Try it and find out . We don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , let me enlighten you . Grayza doesn 't frighten me . Her Command Carrier doesn 't frighten me . Your bomb doesn 't frighten me and neither do you . Damn . I 'm on the brink of devastation , Minnie Pearl . ( beeping ) Perhaps we should go there together . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . ( alien announcement over P.A. ) 1812 , this room bug free ? ( 1812 chirps ) Good boy . Okay , convince me . Crystherium Utilia . The flower . Yes . Very important . Oh . It 'd better be . Is that why they 're growning it in the Bat Cave ? That 's right . You 've been there ? Listen up , Grasshopper . I finally have a plan that works . It 's simple . We get in , we break bread . We see the sights , we grab you , we get out . And now you 're gonna throw flowers at me ? We need to destroy the Crystherium . Flowers trump wormholes ? At the moment , yes . What have I told you about smoking in my head ? ! Hey . - Sit down ! I ain 't sayin ' nothin ' . You ... Sit down ! - He 's the boss . I 'm talking to you . Flowers . ( scoffs ) The number one secret in the whole Scarran Empire . Ha . Even the Charrids and Kalish haven 't figured its real deal . Stark used to live here on Katratzi , assisting the leadership caste with their death rituals . My side , you 're side ! My side , you 're side ! Frell me again ! That why you were torturing him when I met you ? That 's right . Crystherium growth requires very specific and rare conditions . The Scarrans can only propel their power forward from these few locations . And destroying a bunch of flowers is supposed to set ' em back ? For hundreds of cycles . Why ? 'Cause the need ' em . Scarrans . Simplistic , brutish creatures . Should have died out generations ago . What happens if they eat the flower ? Big brains . Evolutionarily competitive . Hey , you know , Staleek , Ahkna . And if they don 't eat ' em ? Your dog could beat ' em at checkers ! Ha ! Hey ! Though Stark provided many details , I was unable to learn of Katratzi 's location . You rescued him prior to that breakthrough . Sorry to stitch you up . No , you 're not . You were taking too long with the wormholes , John . Reality provides opportunity . I needed some way to hurt the Scarrans . Now . You know , you 're not ... you 're not making any sense . You ... you take the knowledge from my head , and then you tell me that you give it to him ... what , so I 'm gonna rescue him ? I have no wormhole knowledge , John . But Harvey said ... Scorpius knows everything you know . So what , I lied . Harvey ? Oh , that is clever . We had a deal . I help you rescue Aeryn Sun from the Scarrans , you give me wormholes . Boss says lay low ! Don 't go near him anymore . Give him some peace . But obviously you betrayed our contract , yes ? But you know what ? You went and left him behind to die . You had no intention of returning for my rescue , did you ? Fail-safe . You screw the boss , I find a way to get you reinterested . You trying to lay this off on me ? You see , if my Neural Clone has returned , it is only because you have betrayed me . You trying to say Harvey 's back because of me ? You should honor your contracts , John . No . No contract . You betrayed us . We had a deal . No . He screwed us ! And now you get on your high horse . We had a deal . Hey , you took a bribe . You bank the cut but when the heat 's on , you 're just another dumb copper doing his job . Unbelievable ! Hey ! Look at these little beauties . Would you have left me to perish with the Scarrans ? Under the circumstances ... yeah . Hey , he 's right , you know ? We 're brothers , from different sides of an imaginary line . Good , bad . Bad , good . Your side , my side , my side ... Sit down ! So , here we are . Cadaver and Hutch . A team . What now ? We must destroy the flowers . And if I say no ? I will attempt to accomplish the task myself . However , rest assured , mine is now the only path off Katratzi . Hey ! Hey , you better listen to him , screw . He 's smarter than you . You used me . We use each other . - You 're better at it . Oh , you 're learning . The bomb ? Clever . When it goes off , plan on being nearby . Braca : 400 Scarran Scrambler Cannons were trained on us the microt that you entered here . Minister Ahkna informed us that unless you were returned them safely , they 'd fire . Well , they can 't do that . To honor the truce , they have to let you go wherever you want . They 'll let us go . They just won 't let you leave with us . They feel it violates the terms of the agreement . Braca , Officer Sun ? Could we have a moment alone , please ? ( whispers ) : Stay on Comms . There 's nothing that I can do to help . Even the Enhanced Marauder wouldn 't get you clear . The Scarrans are on full alert , weapons primed . You 'll never get out of here . I 'll see you later . Where are you going ? That 's a medical area . I have something I need to take care of . Personal problem ? Let 's go . So you need to watch ? Wait for her here . All that astonishing wormhole knowledge , and still you will not share it with us . You came in here big and bold , dancing on tabletops , and look at you now , begging for scraps . I may be jammed , possibly dead , but I 'm not begging . You can get that fantasy outta your head . In my hands , you can have peace . I can have peace ! I have been in your hands . There 's no peace there , just power . You are so self-righteous ! I have used all my skills , all my resources for one perfect chance at peace . And because of you , it is gone ! And I am ... Frelled . Screwed . Raped . Welcome to the universe , Commandant . ( alien announcement over P.A. ) Chiana : I can 't believe they 're allowing us inside . Everything 's working , right ? Yeah , it seems to be . All right . Well , let 's get the others . Blast our way outta here . No , no . Someone 's been in here . I can smell it . Well the defenses were up , right ? No . I don 't know what they 've done . Maybe frelled with the weapons , planted a homing beacon , or a bomb . Frell it ! I have to shut the ship down and run a full systems diagnostic check . How long will that take ? Three arns . Well what if we find something that we can 't fix ? Then we go with Scorpius ' plan . Frelling elevators . Rygel : Lock ourselves in an elevator while it tunnels through the solid rock ? Noranti : Sounds reasonable . Sounds fahrbot ! Sikozu may not be able to provide elevator access . Therefore , we need to locate someone who can . Stark . What ? Who 's Stark ? Another lunatic with the wrong number of eyes . Oh . And there he is . He is not . That is a Bioloid replica . And how do you know that ? Stark would never torture me . Emperor Staleek replaced the real Stark with a Bioloid to fool Ahkna into believing he was real . But you 're actually working for Staleek ? So he believes . Oh , I do admire your compartmentalization of duplicity . How do we find the real Stark ? Find the Bioloid Duplicator . Stark is undoubtedly imprisoned within it . Where did you disappear to on the Command Carrier ? Some unfinished business . Wanna tell me about it ? Later . D 'Argo 's still working on his ship , and Sikozu 's trying to scam the codes . Any other alternatives ? Oh , we can always give the Scarrans what they want . Dead in a few microns ... Or we could try the banzai approach . Or we could just follow Scorpy 's plan . Damn , you cannot stop following me around , can ya ? And you just can 't leave . Wouldn 't Grayza help you ? Actually , she 's the high bidder . Perhaps now is the time for you to hear my offer . You all go free now . What 's the price ? You leave Scorpius behind for me . And what 's in it for you ? I will make sure the hierarchy blames Staleek for your escape . You understand I know nothing about Scarran politics . But I 'm guessing that that means that they fire him and you get his job . Ambition . Well , " if it were done , when 'tis done , ' twere best it were done quickly . " ( chuckles ) Thanks . She scares the crap out of me . It 's the hat . Emperor , about Crichton 's bomb . In under a quarter of an arn , we will have computed the final code . With it , this will disarm the detonator . Sir . Satisfactory . Security 's been heightened since the riots . All the codes have been changed . What can be done ? There 's a master keychip that overrides all codes . It 'll run the elevator and give you complete access to the system 's schematics . Can you get it ? Not very easily . And if I get caught , then ... It could expose the entire Kalish underground . Just tell me this . Will it help defeat the Scarrans ? Yes . Yes , it will . Aeryn : So , what do you think ? Crichton : I think Lady Macbeth is gonna find a way to screw us . But Staleek is probably way ahead of her . Which leaves us with Plan ... " E " ? " E " for ... Both : Elevator . Mm-hmm . And I 'm gonna tapdance for the Emperor . Be careful . He 's not an idiot . I know . But he can 't do jack to me as long as this bomb 's ticking . ( fading whir , stops ticking ) You can 't reactivate the bomb in any way ? Not in any useful manner . So what are we supposed to do then ? D , can you get Lo 'La reactivated ? Well it should be another arn at least . They 'll find us in half that . Sparky , where are ya ? Stuck . Guards all around . Can 't go anywhere at this point . Well , get to the elevator if you can . Right . Where is the elevator ? Where is Crichton ? He won 't get far . The station is sealed . Minister Ahkna , that may well be your epitaph . Sikozu has managed to summon the Rabrokator . What the hell 's that ? Some kind of massage tool ? It 's a drilling elevator . But it won 't do us any good without the keychip . D 'Argo : What 's he doing here ? Scorpius ? He 's giving us the shaft as usual . Everybody in . Mind the gap . Safer in than out . I 'll try and cross-fire the drilling controls . Yes , we can try , but it will not work without ... Wait ! Wait , wait ! - Wait , wait , wait ! I 've got it . Thank you . ( gasps ) No ! Get us moving . We have navigational control . Then go ! ( gasps ) You drive like dren . Get the drills working . I 'm trying , but it 's gonna take a little bit of time . Take us to the bottom . The Crystherium cavern . The shaft ends there . It means they will not be able to reach us in another car . It also means Sikozu has time to activate the drill . Crichton . Crichton ! Ah , frell him ! Let 's find Stark . Good idea . Why ? Scorpius claims Stark knows this base . Maybe he knows a way out . Oh . They 're in the Rabrokator . We 're trying to override . Ma 'am . Sensors detect weapons fire within the base . And communication intercepts indicate Scarran forces are in pursuit of Crichton , with orders to kill . They must have deactivated the bomb . Then he 's lost . As are we . Go to battle stations . Ma 'am ? Are you questioning me ? I cannot get the drills activated . Sputnik , stay on it . Chiana , the doors ! - Frell ! Got it ! Aeryn , stay with him . - Be careful . That was not me . They 're trying to override the override ! Dueling overrides . Don 't you hate that ? Okay , Lo 'La should be functional by now . Start the drills , get us to the surface , and I 'll signal Lo 'La , then we go ! We must destroy them . - Why ? The mother plant is the key . It fertilizes the others . Kill it and no new Crystherium can grow here . ( gun beeps ) Shielded . The Rabrokator has stopped at the Crystherium cavern . I want it recalled . Now ! Come on . Hurry up . Come on . - These doors are getting pushier . I didn 't know about it . Stark didn 't know about it ! This must be a new addition by the Scarrans ! He doesn 't like to lose , does he ? Got it . The drills are enabled . We can core our way to anywhere on the planet . I 've regained control of the drilling elevator . Now get it back up to this level . ( shrieks ) D 'Argo ! I 'll handle it . - Yeah . Get it open ! Frell ! ( grunting ) - Come on ! D 'Argo , hurry up ! ( grunting ) Go , go , go , go ! Oh no , wait , wait , wait ! Sikozu , don 't ! - Keychip ! ( screaming ) What the frell 's going on up there ? We couldn 't override their override of our override . Oh , great . They stole our getaway car . That 's our only way out . And their way in . Your father would be proud , Ahkna . Security under him was riddled with top-down incompetence as well . Jenek : Emperor . The Command Carrier is showing increasing signs of battle readiness . Any other exits ? No , it 's nothing but rock and hay fever . Company 's coming . Frell . - Time to go . ( zapping ) Grasshopper . Hide . Get down . Hey , did you get my bomb ? - What ? Whoa . I can 't believe that I left a nuclear bomb in an elevator . Well , that 's all right . You 've done worse . These weapons will be useless if they 're Scarrans . It 's gonna be Scarrans . You cannot be taken alive , John . - Be quiet . Chiana : Am I wrong or are we frelled ? No . There is a way . I 'm not like normal Kalish . There are others like me . We 're part of a resistance movement , dedicated to overthrowing Scarran domination . ( sniffs ) We are genetically engineered to kill Scarrans by emitting an intense radiation that specifically destroys their heat producing gland . Did anyone else know about this , or is it just me ? Uh ... Okay Sikozu , go ahead . Not without a promise first . If the Scarrans were to learn there are others engineered like myself , they would kill millions of innocents to root us out . Sikozu , we 're a team . Your promise is safe . Guards . D 'Argo , Scarrans are very good at retrieving the truth . We 're not gonna be tortured again . Agreed . Agreed . Go . Do not look upon me . Especially you . Hold fire . Kalish , present yourself and surrender . ( gagging ) Okay , Chiana . Grab the weapons . - Got it . Come on Scorp , let 's go . - Let 's go . She 'll be fine . Get those weapons . Grasshopper , it 's time . No . We gotta go . Do the math . It 's over . I ... do not lose ! Be happy to give you lessons . Now ... you in or out ? Come on , let 's go ! ( panel beeping ) Come on ! Hurry up ! Is that him ? Yes . Yes , it is . Open it up . Stark . Stark ! Are you alive ? Rygel ? Oh , you lunatic . You ... you 're green . How lovely of you to notice . Is nothing sacred ? You wanna deal with Stark , you 're gonna have to deal with me . No ! Let go ! You pompous little Dominar of nothing ! I 'm gonna rip your tiny little heart out . ( sizzling ) Thanks , witch . My pleasure . Commandant Grayza , see reason . Reason indicates that you have subverted this conference and with it , any chance of peace . Ridiculous . Your vessel arms itself for battle while we continue to operate under a banner of truce . Reason dictates that I not believe a single word you say . Reconsider , Peacekeeper . Adhere to the name you have chosen for your kind . Monitor their every move and transmission . Should they attack , annihilate them without mercy . Ma 'am , what are you doing ? Pursuing honor , Captain . We 're at peace . Under truce . And vastly outnumbered . And about to rewrite the course of history . Prepare to launch simultaneous salvos on every weapons system . Now ! Sergeant . ( computer blipping ) Have we solved the override problem yet ? Not yet . - Did you put the key in ? Yes , I used the frelling key . Why do we even bother ? What are you doing ? - Sending a message . The connection has been severed . Fix it . Drill 's on . Hey , you know how to drive this Wonkavator ? Do you ? No . - Then why ask ? Chiana : Frell ! Kalish sensors report an unusual energy discharge in the cavern . The status of the Crystherium ? Unknown . We 've lost contact with the Strike Team . And Crichton ? He has activated the drill and is coring through solid rock . Impossible to predict his destination , my love . I 'll tell you your destination , my love . A frelling torture station if you don 't stop him ! Right , well , you at least know how to get where we 're going , right ? No . Well then , go faster . Here 's faster . It 's a hell of a ride . Kinda fun , huh ? Okay , it 's no longer a joke . Staleek : Protection of the Crystherium was your number one priority . Yes , my Lord , but it was not I who gave permission for the access code . What are you implying , Rahzaro ? We had nothing ! Do not give me your excuses . Sire . Commandant Grayza refuses to acknowledge on all frequencies . I credit her choice of suicide over failure . How are you positioned ? Well , they will be accorded every opportunity to cease fire . Peacekeeper Command will find no fault with our self-defense . Captain Jenek here epitomizes the competence I demand . Perhaps you can next assist Minister Ahkna in her follies ? Capture Crichton and her job will be yours . Sire . Fools . Tell me when target acquisitions are complete . Ma 'am . There is no battle here , ma 'am . Why are you so averse to conflict , Captain ? And why are you so adversed ? ! How dare you ? Who do you think you are ? Captain Miklo Braca , Officer of the Fleet , Peacekeeper Interplanetary Service . Oh . Nobody . Ma 'am , you 'll start a war . A war is inevitable . Braca : We sail under a flag of truce . Let us leave beneath its protection . Didn 't Scorpius tell you ? Truce with the Scarrans is suicide . Oh . So the men and women of this vessel must pay for your miscalculation with their lives . Grayza : It 's for the greater good , Captain . And we shall all be remembered as heroes . Commandant Grayza . Under Article Six Rulu , Uniform Code of Admiralty Conduct , Section 19 : Due to a state of incapacitation of judgment displayed in multiple encounters under stress , I hereby invoke the Transfer of Command and relieve you of duty immediately . ( Grayza chuckles ) Officer of the Deck ! Weapons ! Would you be so kind as to shoot this mutinous captain dead where he stands . Sorry , ma 'am . Captain Braca has already relieved you of command . Braca : Now let 's get this ship out of here . Crichton : I never did ... like Disneyland . ( both gasping ) Oh ! Dad , are we there yet ? My head hurts . Chiana ( laughing ) : Let 's go again ! ( loud whirring ) Oh ! From this moment on , you will disregard her status as Ruling Caste Scarran and ignore Minister Ahkna 's orders . Am I clear ? - Sire . Besides myself , John Crichton is the single most important person on this base . Am I clear ? ! Apprehend him and bring him before me now . ( grunting ) Your Excellency ! You must leave now . It 's the elevator ! ( yelling ) ( motor winding down ) Did we hit the surface ? Crichton : I don 't know . Let 's find out . D , the doors . Secure the Emperor 's safety ! You , you and you with me ! Staleek : Alive ! Keep Crichton alive ! Sire . General Rahzaro , it 's Crichton and the others . Be ready . The lights not working . D 'Argo : Nothing 's working . Let 's find out where we are . Fire ! Whoa ! Okay . That 's no good . - Where are we ? Crichton : Um ... conference room . - What ? Rahzaro : Come out now or die ! Are we cursed ? Could we be cursed ? Well , that depends on whether this will hold . Fire again ! Scorpius : The Rabrokator is quite strong . We can 't stay in here forever . What about that hatch ? No . No , it 'll be a drop of at least a metra . Sparky ? Grandma ? Where have you been ? We 're at D 'Argo 's ship , and it 's crawling with Scarrans . Here 's our chance to see if Lo 'La is reactivated . Rygel , are you standing near the ship ? Well clear . Why ? ( D 'Argo speaks Luxan ) Rygel : Hey , Vaskreta ! That did it ! The guards are down . We did it ! We 've reached the Crystherium chamber . All dead . Hold your positions until reinforcements arrive . I will check on the Emperor . They are not to leave here ! Grasshopper . How important is that mother plant ? I would trade my life for its destruction . What about my wormhole debt ? Of course . Ryge . Are you in Lo 'La ? Yes , Crichton . We 're safe . What have you done , John ? Just fixed your little flower problem . You reactivated it , didn 't you ? Yeah . It should go off in about ... 60 microts . And then it explodes ? Yeah . A big explosion ? Mm . ( bomb beeping ) Oh . God , we should 've voted . All in favor , show of hands . All opposed ? Three to two . Sikozu abstains . The concussive pressure must exit through the elevator system . D 'Argo : And this shaft . At this distance the compartment should protect us . It might work . We 'll find out in 15 microts . This is your last chance . Come out ! Now ! Love you . Love you , too . Emperor , the Crystheriums are intact . The matriarch plant has not been harmed . Our fears were completely groundless . Three ... Sikozu : Two ... ( beeping ) ( rumbling ) What is that ? Rygel : Crichton ! What the hezmana just happened ? ! Where are you , you fahrbots ? ! Did you blow up the bomb ? How could you blow up the bomb ? ! You missed the vote . I never thought I 'd see you again , Stark . And I always believed I would . It is a pleasure to have you aboard . Time for another Starburst , Pilot ? Moya and I believe four is enough . She 's tired and there 's no evidence that anyone is pursuing us . Scarrans must still be too busy on Katratzi . Rygel : They got off easy . And to celebrate the victory , I shall cook a voluptuous caspitian haunch stew . ( sighs ) ( sighs ) ( D 'Argo chuckles softly ) ( both chuckling ) More . More . - More . More . How long does it take for you to recover ? I do not know . I 've never done this before . Huh . Stark . Hm . Everything old is new again . Except the old thing 's getting really old . Hey , honey . Guess what I did at work today . I wore a bomb . A nuclear bomb in a field of flowers . I could get lucky . Tomorrow I could have a bigger bomb . I could kill more people . Maybe they 'll be innocent people . Children , maybe .

 Well , is it them , or isn 't it ? Moya can 't be certain until she 's closer . - Which one , green or black ? - This is not the time . D 'Argo ! Green or black ? Well , the black of course ! I mean , far be it from me to say , but I 've always thought that the cut of that green shirt doesn 't suit the shape of your body . You know , it 's gotta be them . We are near the rendezvous point . If it is them ... why are they on a transport pod , and where is Talyn ? Crichton is not going to like having the other Crichton around . He 'll like having Aeryn aboard , though . You want me to wear this ? Yeah , you look blixk ! - In this ? - Yeah I don 't think so . The Transport Pod has turned and is heading our way You make contact yet ? Yes , but they 're not responding . You know what ? Perhaps they can 't respond . In the last message we recieved , all they said is that they defeated a Retrieval Squad . We don 't know at what cost . D 'Argo , if Talyn is a casualty , then ... John , I 'm sure everyone 's all right . Rendezvous in 600 microts . Pilot , there could be casualties . Have them land near the Med area , and get Jool and Chiana down here , fast ! She 's gonna be walkin ' off that pod . Chiana 's right . Aeryn 's fine . I 'm sure the other you has taken extra good care of her . I mean ... all I meant was that I 'm sure that he did everything that you would have done if you had been with Aeryn ... all this time . Don 't move ! Please ... don 't move . I doubt that we could . Identify yourselves ! Our calling card a Peacekeeper tralk . We have just escaped from imprisonment ... can you help us ? My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship- - this living ship ... of escaped prisoners- - my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared , helpless ... for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay , protect my home , not show them you exist . But then you 'll never know the wonders I 've seen . You were travelling through the Uncharted Territories in a Transport Pod ? A pod that was meant as a target for the weapons testing of a new Peacekeeper deep space device . Uh ... you have more Janeray Syrup ? She is like Rygel . What were you doing in a pod meant for weapons testing ? We were part of the test . They wanted to see how different species would react to fire from their new weapon . How we would die . The Peacekeeper Tech was doing a last microt check of the pod . We were able to ... overpower him I ... was able to overpower him . and blast ourselves ... out of there . Ah , ah , ah ! Not too close . He 's a Scarran . If you are concerned because of my heat protection ... First thing Peacekeepers do with Scarran prisoners . By ... removing the gland , it protects them and ... weakens me . Frell . This pod is comin ' apart at the seams . The weapon the Peacekeepers were testing destroys the bonding of metallic molecules . That 's why this pod is so damaged . What exactly are we lookin ' for ? A Boolite . And what does he look like ? Big , small , hairy , blue , green ? He doesn 't ... look like he used to . You see ... Boolites have a much much higher metal content than other species , so ... when the weapon hit our pod ... Excuse me . What the hell is this ? That 's the Boolite . Or at least , a part of him . Boolite body parts can survive independent of the main body for as much as half a cycle . Right . And he 's still alive ? You have to try to save him . Help put him back together . Right . Why aren 't they at the rendezvous point ? If I have to spend two more microts on this midget ship ... I 'm going to vomit ! Talyn has found Moya ... at the extreme range of his senses . Oh ! Was it too much to ask that they be where they said they 'd be ? ! Talyn , set intercept course . He 's coming ! He 's coming ! It 's Talyn ... He 's on an intercept course . What ? Why don 't you go and , ah , welcome them back ? I 'll make sure our guests don 't get into any trouble . Thanks , man Sparky How you doin ' , man ? Long time no see . Yes , ah ... good to see you too ! But if anything is missing from my quarters , blood is going to spill . Whatever . Crais . Well , there 's a familiar face . Hello , John . What 's wrong ? The , uh ... other ... Crichton ... is dead . Ah ... you have , ah , visitors on Moya ? Yeah , there 's um .. A female ! Oh , it is ... a female Oh ! Please rise . You ... recognize me ? Who could forget the Royal Profile ? You 're alive . Indeed . And you are ... ? Orrhn Pak , from the Jensile Province . Oh ... Or , at least ... I was . And you have been a Peacekeeper prisoner ? Arrested ... because I refused allegiance to ... Dominar Bishan . Oh , that 's no crime . It 's an act of courage . Oh ! I shouldn 't have been speaking of myself , of my travails , when I am in ... your presense . Forgive me ... your highness . Forgive me . No ... it is permissable ... for you to be the focus of attention , if I desire it . And I , uh , I ... I ... do so ... desire it . I 'm not well-schooled in the arts . It just needs to give us some idea of what the Boolite looks like . Stand there ! As you instruct . And don 't even think about moving . Chiana . Have you seen Aeryn and the others ? Only for a moment . Not quite the reunion we were expecting . The other Crichton , dead , and- - and Stark searching for Zhaan 's spirit . Well , with a single Crichton and Stark missing , perhaps it will restore some sanity to the ship . Stand back ! What ? The pulse blast . Didn 't you hear it ? ! No . Stay there . No ? Okay , okay ... it 's happenin ' again . I 'm frellin ' sensing ' stuff before it happens . - So much for sanity , move - D 'Argo , I heard a pulse blast ! Frell Hey ! Hey , come on . You can 't leave me in here ! You 're a Peacekeeper . They beat me ... they took me hostage You 're a fugitive . I 'm a member of the Peacekeepers . If you help me out of here , they 'll be a big ... big reward . What ? 200 darcats for a Tech ? Those escaped prisoners you have on your ship ... they 're dangerous . Don 't you care ? No , not any more . If this image has appeared , it means my mask has reached it 's destination , and you have made contact with it . I have a message for you , Crichton . For you alone . Listen ... listen Crichton , there 's a message ... Crichton ... Moya has detected a signal . Lousy timing , Pilot , really . Lousy timing . What kind of signal ? A Peacekeeper distress signal . How close is it ? Crichton , you don 't understand . The signal was sent from here ! Somebody aboard Moya just broadcast a distress call ... to the Peacekeepers . Pilot , can you isolate the source of the signal ? It appears to have come from Tier 7 or 8 . I have DRDs searching there now . Has anyone answered it yet ? We 're not going to give them time . Moya will initiate Starburst in ... 100 microts . What about Talyn ? Crais has ordered him to Starburst alone on a similar vector . Talyn will make contact as soon as he can locate us . Why would anybody here want to signal the Peacekeepers ? What about the Tech ? He was a Peacekeeper . No , no , no . The Tech is kept in a cell on Tier 11 . I put my currency on the Scarran . Well , normally I 'd agree with you , but Naj Gil has been with me the whole time . What about the Nebari ? Hubero has never left my sight . And ah , since she arrived , sweet Orrhn has been atop me . Or , ah , beneath me . Or , ah ... Okay ... there 's a mental polaroid we can all live without , Rygel . Okay , plan . We gotta double-time prep on the pod . We gotta get them outta here as soon as we can , and until we do we should lock ' em all up for safekeeping . Agreed ? No , John . I will not imprison Naj Gil . He hasn 't done anything wrong . He 's gonna stay with me . And Hubero ... never leaves my side . Just like before . And Orrhn and I will just be be making the Hynerian with two backs- - trunks , whatever . Just ... remember , one of ' em sent the signal . Be careful . Starbursting , now . According to Hubero 's rendering of the Boolite ... this obviously ... goes here . Wrong . It 's clearly vascular , not skeletal . Put this piece there , attach that piece to there ... then there . Yes , well , that would seem to be correct I was hoping that once we got enough of him together that he would be able to tell us how to do the rest . That 's why I 'm starting on the head and mouth first . Head and mouth ... What , you don 't think that that 's the head and that 's the mouth ? Well ... not unless he sits on his mouth . Mag-stet . Turbo-sealer . Fluffy pink slippers ... Donald Duck ... Mickey Mouse ... Huey , Luey , and Duey ... You wanna talk ? Okay , fine , no talking . No , you know what ? I wanna talk . I had words with Crais , and , ah ... he told me that you and the other me ... . Actually he didn 't ... tell me anything . He ah ... told me to talk to you . So , I assume ... Aeryn , I 'm sorry . I ... maybe you 're right ... . Maybe we shouldn 't talk . Want some advice ? Nope . Oh , my friend , I ... I don 't know what to say . I don 't have any advice . It 's difficult , isn 't it ? You 're ... jealous ... of the other you . Aren 't you ? He died ... the other guy . the copy . And now Aeryn thinks that you are the copy . Hey , man . How ya doin ' ? Crichton ? What ... do you want ? Their transport pod is stocked , and it 's , ah , almost repaired . Is Barbarella ready to vamoose ? I 'm not sure I want her to go . In fact , I 'm sure I don 't . Rygel , look , I-I completely understand , but ... you cannot let the little appendage start tellin ' the big appendage what to do . John . I think I 'm ... in love with her . and ... I think she loves me . Well ... that may be the best reason of all to get her out of here as quick as you can . You still have half an arn . I heard what you said . I ... didn 't mean ... I liked it , Rygie . Are you ready to go again , hm ? Again ! ? We 've got half an arn . I 've heard Dominars never need rest . Growl like a Luxan ! So , what 'd you do ? Why 'd they imprison you ? Actually , when the Peacekeepers found me , they tried to give me back , but ... Nebari Prime didn 't want me . To them I 'm just ... another mouth to feed in a non-conformist colony . Non-conformist ? What ? Why ? What ? You 're an ... an ... an ... an , androgen . Not exactly male , not exactly female . Not exactly anything . When I was growing up , I was told about androgens and ... . But ... I , ah , they were always taken ... right after birth . I ... I never met one . At least you didn 't think you ever did . What 's happening ? He 's talking . Listen , listen traitor ... traitor ... He keeps repeating the same word , over and over . Traitor ? I bet he still thinks he 's on the transport pod . So , the traitor was on the pod . Can he hear us ? Well ... there 's an ear here somewhere Okay ... this is ... a little too Naked Lunch Can you tell us who the traitor is ? ... I ... I don 't remember ... I 've used all the brain matter we 've found so far . It is possible the ... part of his memory that holds the answer isn 't here . Either that , or we 're tracking ' it all over the ship with our shoes . Shots fired ! Shots fired ! Shots , where ? Pilot , it 's D 'Argo , I 'm in the Center Chamber ! Naj Gil has been shot ! - What happened ? - We were in the Center Chamber . He heard a noise and came out . There was a pulse blast ... - Direction ? - I don 't know . By the time I came out it was all gone . Can you get me something to stop the bleeding ? - I knew it ... I knew it . - I got him . I knew someone was gonna get shot . Pip , that is no help to us right now . If you can tell us who did it , that might be useful . Perhaps you know ! No ! I have no idea ! Well , think ... hard . Leave her alone ! What 's all the noise about ? Where have you been ? Let go of her , you lunatic Luxan ! She 's never left my side . D 'Argo ... that 's not helpin ' , man . One of them has to have done it . Not Hubero . She 's been with me the whole time . And I 've been with Orrhn . Release her , now ! Get us away from this welnitz ! I agree ... there 's too much dren in this room . Come on . There 's been another signal . What ! ? DRDs are trying to find the source . Pilot , Starburst ! Moya can 't . Not for another arn . And this signal ... it sent out Moya 's coordinates . Who the hell is doin ' this ? This is the signaling device . DRDs found it attached to a Neural Cluster on Tier 8 . Can you tell whose it is ? It 's constructed of parts easily found on Moya . But it required an impressive technical knowledge ... to assemble . Anything ? It hasn 't moved . Nor have I , if that 's what you 're wondering . Pilot , can you confirm that ? The DRD has sensed no movement . Is something wrong ? Pilot , how long before their transport pod is repaired ? The DRDs ... will finish within a half arn . Correction ... a quarter arn . We 'll have you off this boat ... as soon as we can . Rygel ... Chiana ... listen up . Unless we got a tech who can walk through walls ... or hypnotize DRDs ... the bad guy 's gotta be with one of you . Now ... we are not going to hurt anybody ... but their transport is almost fixed , so ... we 're going to load ' em with supplies ... and send them to a very friendly commerce planet . Everybody goes their own way . Okay ? Pip ? Sparky ? Okay ? ! Damn it ! The others can leave ... you 'll stay . And then ? And then , Orrhn , dear Orrhn . There are many things we must talk about . Do we have to talk about them now ? Again ? Here ? I 've managed to stop the bleeding . But I know even less about Scarrans than I do Boolites . I mean , I thought these guys were virtually impenetrable . They are , but the skin hadn 't fully healed from the removal of the heat gland . Whoever shot him knew exactly ... where to aim . Pilot , any sign of Rygel or Chiana ? Nothing . They are still not responding to their comms . Aeryn . What ? Crichton , he , uh ... D 'Argo ... don 't . When they finally find us ... they 'll be angry at you for hiding me . They get angry at me alot . Do you trust Crichton ? Would he really allow us to leave on the transport pod ? Yeah , I trust him ... . But do you really wanna leave ? Oh , Chiana ... I don 't want to cause you any trouble . I 'll wait in the transport pod until it 's fixed . W-w-wh-whoever shot you ... would be in the pod . What are you talking about ? I haven 't been shot . I-I ... I mean , Naj Gil . Whoever shot him . Hubero wait ! Traitor ... What 's he saying ? Beauty ... so ... so ... beautiful ... More pulse fire ! The DRD watching the Peacekeeper Tech has gone dead ! And the cell door 's open ! On my way , Pilot . Get the DRD 's searching . She ... betrayed ... us ... " She " ? On pod ... I caught her making a deal with Tech . The name of the traitor ? Name ? Wake up . Wake up , now ! I really need you to move your ass , now ! I 'm afraid I must insist ! Rygel . Chiana . It 's Orrhn , she sent the signals . Gotcha , Crichton ... Hubero and I are on our way to the Maintenance Bay . Keep your eyes out . - Orrhn must have shot Naj Gil . - And let the Tech loose . Rygel , are you hearing this ? Move ! Why , Orrhn , why ? You were a prisoner of the Peacekeepers like the rest of us ! Because , my dear gullible Dominar ... the odds of staying free stunk ! So , I struck a deal with the Tech . W-w-well , when you were on Moya , you were free . For how long ? I don 't want to spend my life running from the Peacekeepers . And once I got here I found a superb bargaining chip ... you . They 'll be far more interested in recapturing a full royal ... than a lowly soldier , like myself . You 're ... a soldier ? You might not have deigned to take pleasure with me ... if you 'd known I was a common Soldier . And I needed you to take pleasure so you would fall asleep ... and I could roam the ship . It was unfortunate that the Scarran saw me . But ... you slept too . All Hynerians sleep deeply after ... pleasure . The " pleasure , " Dominar ... was all yours . You were ... faking ? Oh , males ! Move it ! You seen Aeryn ? One tier down . The DRDs are searching all the other Tiers . What the hell was that ? Somebody has neutralized Moya 's calorics ... we 're unable to move . They 're gonna make a run for it and they got Rygel . - Rygel could be going voluntarily . - And maybe he 's not . You 're not really gonna leave the Boolite here like this , are you ? Under the circumstances , he can wait . I 'm going to assist in the search . For ... me ? Move ! Get down ! Help ! Orrhn , let 's do it ! Help ! Not that piece ! Shut up , shut up , Dominar ! Shut up ! - Whoa , Chiana , don 't shoot , it 's me ! - Down ! Hubero , down ! Go , go , go , go ! Crichton ! They 've got Rygel . Pilot ! Close the outer hangar doors ! I can 't ... Moya 's connection has been severed . I 've got an idea Begin broadcasting our location to the Peacekeepers . - We had the same idea . - No , I wanted to take your module . You didn 't know D 'Argo could fly this . Frelling dren ! There 's a ship gaining on us ! - Any word from Talyn ? - Negative . He still hasn 't caught up with us yet . Okay we 're going in . They won 't shoot us down with him aboard . I wouldn 't be so sure about that . Opening rear hatch . He 's right above us ! What 's their plan ? ! Oh ... they 're gonna kill you , bitch . Right , D 'Argo , you 're position is good . I will fire close to the hatch . Put this on ! Keep it steady D 'Argo ! I 'm trying ! Steady . This cable gonna hold ? It 's irridium alloy of course it 'll hold . Just like the Budong . - Budong ? What are you talkin ' about ? - You ... Just ... follow my lead . Go , now , Aeryn ! Go ! Well ... this 'll be fun . They 're on the hull ! Here . They 're coming in ! Shoot them ! Shoot them ! I gotcha , Sparky ! Help me , help me , Rygie ! Aeryn , I got him . Good . Rygie ! What ... what ... what is going on ? Hey , Buckwheat , how ya doin ' ? I will not be taken to task ... for having a trusting nature . Ah ... women . Talyn 's back ... he 's found us . Tell Talyn to steer clear the Tech hit the cell drive . This pod is going to blow . We 've got to go ... now ! Now , D 'Argo ! It 's all in my head ... which means it 's in yours too . Wormholes ... A to Z. You 've probably already heard what ... we did with it . And that 's just the beginning . You could fry a whole solar system . Furlow is still out there ... somewhere . But for right now , the Scarrans are back to square one . Peacekeepers ... they 're your problem . Look at me . Now look at yourself . You know . Don 't let Scorpius crack this . Whatever it takes . Okay ... I 'm gonna ... piss you off , now , man . Be smart . Don 't ... push her . She takes ... time . Oh , one more thing . Good luck , John . So that 's what I 'm doing ... You don 't have to come along , you don 't have to like it ... I just wanted you to know . Moya and I are against this idea in totality . I am sure Captain Crais is aware that Talyn resists also . You don 't know how far Scorpius is in his wormhole research . You don 't know where he keeps it , you don 't know anything . How are you gonna stop him ? I 'll pass if you don 't mind . Why are you wearing an eyepatch ? Boolite in my eye . Why are you such a moron ? Guys ... I don 't see another option . Scorpius has the knowledge from my brain ... and I 'm not gonna let him shaft the universe with it . You 're all gonna die . You see that one Pip , or are you just guessin ' ? We choose our own path this one is mine . I 'm going to the Command Carrier . I 'm going to stop Scorpius . SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

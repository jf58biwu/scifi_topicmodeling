' So we 're making a loss and breaking even ? Something must be wrong . You don 't know what Yang is like . He tricked him in a game of chance . He lost all his shares in the Ritz . So I juggled the figures a bit . Do we have to get involved in shady deals ? Boss , I 'm just following orders . The brothers won 't object if they 're fed . Can you make this restaurant more profitable ? I won 't run a casino . A whorehouse , then ? Uncle ? Sorry , but there 's a Miss Yang here to see you . Come in . This is Uncle Hai . Good day , I 'm Luming Yang . My father used to own half this place . I believe he died in Shanghai three months ago . Yes . That 's why I 've come to discuss the business side of things with you . This is Mr Kuo Chen Wah . He 's our new boss here . My father gambled his share of the restaurant away . He asked me to find a way to repay you . It 's nothing . Forget it . Wait . He meant at your own convenience . I 've got some money here . Can I give you that for now ? Your father owed us thousands . I could work for you without pay . As what ? I sang and danced at a club in Shanghai . - Why did you leave ? - The club closed . It wasn 't my fault . I was very good . One minute. I 'll sing for you .

To what do we owe the pleasure of this visit ? Relax , this is a social visit . I see you 've spared no expense . I 'm ready to forget Yang 's debts . Give me half of the Ritz . I think ... - Are you the boss here ? - No , he is . Then shut up . Well ? Yang 's debts are not our business . You can see we 've spent a lot on the decor . We don 't need outside investment . Ladies and gentlemen , there 's a great surprise in store tonight . Luming Yang of Shanghai , star of Broadway . I 'm usually short-tempered , but tonight ... Make way , make way ! - Get the lights on . - Nobody move . Stay in your seats . Stop the music . - Spotlights ooff . - Turn on the house lights . The Chief Inspector Ho of Hong Kong here .

Looks like a boss . I won 't disturb them , but I would like a word with you . No problem . Of course . Now what ? Stop searching . Let 's go . Come upstairs . Inspector Ho , please , sit down . I didn 't come here to sit down , I came here because I saw something . Saw something ? Something that doesn 't belong here . You must be mistaken , everything here is bought and paid for . - l mean you . - Me ? I don 't belong here ? Yes , all the people downstairs make a living through theft , deceit and other foul means . Don 't argue with me . I reckon ... amongst all these people ... the only person who hasn 't committed a crime yet ... I want to save you from this den of iniquity . - l want to do you a good turn . - A good turn ? Yes , from now on ... if you can inform me of Yang and Tiger 's activities , then I will put them behind bars . Then you and I ... will create the biggest story to come out of Hong Kong in its history . I must wipe them out . I hope you aren 't one of them . But I have been thinking of a gradual ... Don 't reply now . Think it over and give me a call . I don 't usually trust people , but in your case ... Boss , some tea for Inspector Ho . No need , we won 't be bothering you any further . - What was that ... ? - Sorry , I forgot my hat . Continue . - What did he say ? - He told me to behave . He wouldn 't say that . He must think you are the only innocent person here . Did he ask you to do the right thing ? - No . - Of course he did . He must have asked you to rat on us and do Hong Kong a great service . He must have said he didn 't trust anyone and you shouldn 't miss the boat . So you know what he told me ? Notjust me . Everyone knows . Even the door man . Back to base ! Sorry about the interruption . Continue the music . Let 's give Luming a big hand . Ask your boss to have a drink . This is all water under the bridge . We don 't want to start a war . Very few people are as peace-loving as you . If I was boss , I 'd prefer peace too . Kuo is too young and Hai is too sneaky . - Pass on the message . - lf that 's all , I 'll leave . All debts are paid . Here are the lou 's . - Thank you . - Let 's go . - Tong 's still out buying roses . - What for ? It 's not a proposal . Chen Wah . What is it ? - Have you thought about the future ? - l have thought about it . Everybody 's waiting . Wait till I come back . Wait three years anyway . Hey ! Hey ! Three years ! Don 't you know the Black Tiger gang had 7 bosses in three years ? I can 't find Madam Kao . Can 't you go without roses ? - That 's not the point . - Fine , get started . Get in . I wish you good luck . Thank you , miss . - lsn 't it beautiful ? - Lovely . You people cover the back alley . - Rush in when I throw the cup . - OK . Wait a minute . Tidy up . Kid , you do have it .

Whatever has happened between us in the past , sign here and we 'll be brothers . Understand ? Yes , but ... Are you qualified to sign ? If not , shut up . - l 'll sign . - Now you are talking . With one more clause - we get half your income from the casinos then - unconditionally . Repeat what you said , young man ? Say that again . Go on . You take half the Ritz , we 're entitled to half your assets . Don 't move ! Fools ! Ten Shantung men can 't beat two Cantonese ? Useless morons ! What are you doing with your guns ?

Finished fighting ? Seems we 're late . What did you say , Inspector Ho ? Mr Tiger , was there fighting going on here ? I don 't understand your dialect . Speak Cantonese . Cantonese ? It seems there was a fight here . I 'm sure you weren 't involved . A fight ? I didn 't see anything . - Nothing ? - No . You saw nothing . Are you under duress ? We were having tea and a chat . Well , our tea and chats are over . See you some other day . Any time . Tell me he threatened you and I 'll have him arrested . Inspector Ho , I don 't understand . You 're refusing to cooperate , next time I may be too late . Now I understand . Goodbye . That 's it , then . Let 's go . They were fighting . Do you believe he was having tea ? I 'm not blind . Mission over . Dismissed . The lnspector saved the day , not the rose . I won 't go anywhere without a rose . Superstition . Uncle , do we need to repair the car ? Yes , you and the car . An overhaul is expensive . I suspect Fei is behind the whole thing . You suspect him ? He 's an old-timer and knows the ropes well , yet he failed miserably . So you question Fei 's loyalty ? In our business , there 's one thing we can 't forget ... trust no-one . I don 't like it . You don 't have much choice . - Do you want this ? - No . - Where are you going ? - To the States . Without consulting me ? You never gave me a chance to talk . You only have time for fights and business . You take a holiday. lt 's OK . I 'm not coming back . What ? Why ? - l want to get married . - l told you , it 's impossible . With whom ? With Mr Lu . His parents in the States are dying for him to get married . You think nobody wants me . Don 't try to stop me . You can 't leave ! - Why can 't I go ? - You can 't . Listen to me . - You are rotten ! - Help me , please . It 's none of my business . Carry on . If you leave what will happen to us ? All you care about is business . You never have time for me . Who do you think I am ? The piggy bank ? I never treated you like that . Hey , help me out here . What can I do ? - How do we treat her ? - As the piggy bank , of course . He said it . Don 't deny it again . He 's lying . Don 't believe him . Right , I lied . What lies should I tell now ? Lies ? You fool ! Lady , you know well how I treat you . How do you treat me ? You know . I don 't know . You usually mumble , I don 't know what you 're saying . You 're driving me crazy . Lady , lady ... Lady , are you really going to drop everything and leave ? It 's now or never . Should I wait till you are riddled with holes ? Fiddlesticks ! Did I say something wrong ? I just heard wrong . It 's none of my business . None of your business ? All you do is drink . She 's leaving . That is my business . Stop her . Lady , please , give me two more years . You think I 'd trust you ? ! - l really mean it . - You really mean it ? Let go of me ! Lady , lady , please , stay . You lied to me . No , I didn 't . I paid you back money which my father didn 't even owe you ! I worked hard for you . What have you got to say for yourself ? I told him not to cheat you . I 've never objected . He said the same thing . At first , I didn 't know you well . Later , I didn 't know how to begin . The money is intact . I 'll pay you back . So you cheated because he said so . I didn 't know you then . Now you know how to shift blame . Shut up , you ! Forget it. I don 't want the money . I 'm going . - Lady , listen to me . - Let go of me . Listen to me . Boss . Mr Lu wants to know when we are leaving . None of your business . No , I 've come to report the engine 's dead . Tell him to go away . How can they leave ? Yeah , how can they leave , do I have to push them ? Tell Mr Lu to leave . Tell Mr Lu to leave . Tell him to leave , OK . You depend on others for decisions . Only when they are right . - Lady . - Let me go . Lady , you can 't go ! Don 't go . Give me a reason to stay . A reason ? What reason ? We don 't act on reason . You drink too much . Are you all right ? I 'm really sorry . I 'm really sorry . Boss , Mr Lu insists on seeing Luming first . - What then ? - Gun him down . Shoot him dead . - Let me get up . - Please don 't leave . You can 't trap her like a thief . Kiss her , then she 'll stay . - Kiss her ? - And you refuse to listen . I do , I do . He 'll leave now . I 'll go and clean the car . Don 't touch me . Lady , I am sorry . Baggage in hand ? Going on holiday ? I tried to send your letter , but I was caught and sacked . - Where 's the letter ? - The manager took it . - Mr Manager . - Manager , she wants to see you . Yes ? You have a Shanghai letter addressed to Mrs Kao , it 's mine . Yours ? But you don 't live here . How come there 's a letter for you ? I used your headed note paper . - Kick her out . - Mr Manager , Mr Manager ... I 'm in dire need of the letter . Please give it to me . I was wrong to use your letterhead . I won 't do it again . I won 't do it again . Please , give me my letter . Stop it. ls there a letter for her ? There was but I returned it . No , that letter was non-returnable . He 's taking it to the post . - Madam ! - My letter , my letter ! Go back to work . Nothing . Sorry for the disturbance . Thank you . - Leave now . - Thank you . Thank you very much . You 've fixed everything. I 'm going to have some tea downstairs . Let 's shake hands and be friends . I don 't know if he will accept your ooffer . I don 't think he 's a bad person . You think you know best . We have a proverb , even pigs can fly . So where are you from ? Me ? The most honest of Cantonese people . Remember , morning tea . I 'd better be going . Cantonese , Shandong people , they 're all the same . I 'll say it once more for you . Chicken George used to work on the docks . I know . He has hundreds of dockers working on the harbour . He is very powerful . When you see him , don 't be too humble . I know , the dockers are always delivering goods to Wan Chai . What are you up to ? More business ? You know the Black Dragons have invited me to dinner , I have to go . When he 's talking to me , can you not look at him , please ? Boss , I got it . I bought the chrysanthemum . - A chrysanthemum ? Are you new ? - Chrysanths ' are flowers too . You fool , go out and clean the car . A flower is a flower . Hurry up . Time 's short . No flowers . They 're waiting . Don 't be so superstitious . Let 's go . No , no rose , no meeting . I know you 're looking at him . I 'm glad you have your own ideas . Boss , we can 't find Madam Kao . - l was told she 's sick at home . - Sick ? Mr Wah , this way please . Mr Wah . This way . OK , the flower 's here . We must go . I 've come to buy a flower . Are you all right ? Take your medicine . - Has she got a temperature ? - No , she feels cold . It 's not the flu . This is no use . Give the boss a flower . He needs it for luck . Have you ever thought of giving others some luck ? You 're inhuman . Get a doctor here fast . Boss , doctors are useless . She 's heartbroken . Tell me who did it and he 's dead . Tell me and I 'll cut him to pieces . Tell me , I 'll see if I can help . Who is this ? That 's her daughter . I don 't believe it . She 's so beautiful . Sorry , I didn 't mean it . Forget about it . Stop crying . - l know . Her daughter 's dead . - Shut up . Go and clean the car . Hey , it 's time now , we must go . How can we leave ? The dockers may be ooffended . - Let me buy the flowers first . - Then buy them ... Mr Kuo , this is for you - to bring you and everyone luck . I hope you are all lucky . You should be glad you have such a pretty daughter . Where is she ? Any way we can help ? Her daughter is studying in Shanghai . She 's coming back to see her mother . Wonderful . Does she have money for the ticket ? I 'll buy it for you . She 's coming with her boyfriend and his father to discuss details of their marriage . Madam Kao never let her know about the flowers . She left to study at a young age . She was told not to worry about money because her mother is well known in Hong Kong . She said she lived at King 's . Now if the daughter knows the truth , she 'll be very disappointed ... and if the father and son know , there would be no marriage . Tell me what I can do . Only you can help . You are the only one . You are obliged to help her as her rose brought you good luck . How can I help her ? Easy , send her to King 's and give her a makeover . Easy to say . That takes money . We 've raised some money for her . Here 's it is . Do you think it 's enough ? It 's OK . There 's no need for that . I 'll do whatever you say . I have to leave . - No need to worry , you have me . - l don 't know how to thank you . You sort it out . - Why bother with this ? - lt 's easy. I 'm glad to help . - This way . - Miss Yang , everything 's set . Take care of Madam Kao . So beautiful . - Bring the things in . - Yes . Miss Yang , is everything OK ? Say yes if anyone asks if Madam Kao lives here . But say you don 't know if they ask about her . Madam , welcome to your new home . Chen Wah , over here . - Beautiful , isn 't it ? - Very . Money buys everything . I really don 't know how to thank you for all this wonderful help . - Mr Kuo loves to help people , right ? - Yes . Miss Yang , all your people are here . Come in . Please . Who are they ? This is the beautician , the tailor , the hairdresser . All for you . Afternoon tea is ready . - Who 's he ? - The butler . The butler ? Mr Kuo , this way . Madam Kao deserves a butler . - Uncle , we 're leaving . - Thank you . - You 've everything under control ? - Absolutely . - What ? - We need a husband . - What husband ? - She said she had one . - What should we do ? - Find her one . Me , find her a husband ? Where will I get one of them ? Don 't ask me . Children mean a husband . A husband ? Don 't get me involved . Miss , where will I find one ? Miss , I have the perfect candidate . - Who ? - A friend of mine . is he suitable ? Never mind that , get him here fast . Then you stay . I 'll play any part for money . Follow me .

Mummy , you never mentioned this cousin before . He was the black sheep in the family . Marriage changed all that . Mr Wong , Mr Wong , let 's go back to the hotel . I 'm meeting other friends here . I 've told everyone to go to the hotel . Let 's go . - Uncle ? ! - Why weren 't you introduced ? I 'll start the car . If you don 't get a pay rise , it could mean exploitation . Exploitation makes you feel worthless and that can lead to suicide . Suicide means you 're gone . What do you think so far ? The missing reporters are valuable employees . I am your boss Laughton 's old friend . Stupid conjecture may lead to yourjob disappearing ! I 'm sorry , I just wanted to get some background information on them . Trying to put pressure on me . I 've a job to do . Divide this . - Miss Yang . - Miss Yang . You 're going to see the boat people trying to sell ... lt 's so hot . Let me tell you something nice . Watching them makes me very happy . They want us ... Right . Tell Tong to drive us around tomorrow . You tell him . He 's your man . You tell him . Have you finished ? He hopes we 'll go easy on him . But we 've never been hard on him . Hey , Tong , take Mr Wong sightseeing tomorrow . What about a boat trip ? Whatever ! Just don 't be seen . Have you finished ? We 've got business to discuss . - Call Inspector Ho for me , please . - Yes , sir . Tomorrow we 'll take a drive to the Peak , and then the Gardens . Don 't forget the camera . We 'll have ... Don 't walk about like that , you 're making me ill . I want to . Now don 't forget . The boat people who we left asked us to entertain ... Mr Kuo , please . Boss , the telephone . You 're using my shoe as an ashtray ? Mr Wong wants me to get Chief Inspector Ho . Where can I find an inspector Ho for him ? - What 's wrong ? - l thought you 'd fixed everything . - ls that my call ? - Yes . Fixed . I 'll go clean the car . - Are Filipino maids popular here ? - lt 's becoming fashionable . They 're hard to come by . There is so little money . Why should they have first choice ? Fei , you can take it , but we can 't . You 've helped us for so many years . We won 't forget it , will we ? You can have anything you want . Just say the word . I thank you for your goodwill . Have faith in me . Better days are ahead . Let 's go . Let 's go . Where 's Snake Ming ? He left without saying where he was going . - Have they found Wong ? - Not yet . Who did you call ? My cousin , he works for the shipping company . He 's checking the passenger list . - Inspector . - Where did you go ? The Five Continents Hotel , Luk Kwok Hotel ... ls our Mr Wong at the Five Continents or Luk Kwok ? - Neither . - Then why did you go there ? Then later I found out he was at King 's . Then why did you go to the other places ? - l 've got it . - Got what ? Wong 's already here , so I 'll check the hotel . Who told you to check on Wong ? Find the reporters for me . Why do I have to do everything ? I 've never lied in my life . I 'm really scared . We mustn 't disappoint them . Uncle , you 're more than an hour late . Tiger means business . Do you think Tiger will trick us ? - Our boys will be watching . - l have to get my lucky rose . - Tiger 's been waiting all morning . - We 'll invite him for lunch . He wants to see you now . I must get my rose first . Boss . A couple of Tiger 's stooges . They 've got some nerve , walking in here . What 's up ? - Our boss doesn 't like waiting . - So I 'll invite him for dinner . Freeze ! - Stay there ! - Come with us , Tiger 's orders . Look , guys ... this is our turf . I 'll go with them . You and the boys ... You dare make trouble here ? Tie them up ! I 'll buy my rose , then I 'll see your boss . Let 's go . Tiger will get you for this . So you 're planning to issue stocks here ? That 's the idea . The door ! When ? Very soon , I hope . Gentlemen . We 're associates of Mr Wong 's . is he in ? - Mr Wong is not here right now . - We were told he was in his suite . He 's breakfasting right now . - We 're good friends of his . - Long time associates . Just the man . These are Mr Wong 's business associates . - What now ? - l don 't do anything illegal . That 's kidnapping . - Close the door . - How many have you tied up now ? You own a steel foundry as well ? Good morning , good morning . You 're very early today . Mr Wong , is everything to your liking ? Fine , very comfortable . Mr Wong likes it here . - ls everything OK , cousins ? - Of course . Fresh roses . They 're lovely . A rose to bring you luck . Why do you give him a rose ? Tradition , it 's a family custom . - A tradition . - A family tradition . - Wait ! Come back down ! - Not so loud . Inspector Ho is coming up with two others . Mr Kuo , an urgent call for you . I 'll take it there . Inspector Ho is on his way up . He 's already in the lift . What do we do now ? Cousin . Cousin .

You must be the famous Inspector Ho . At your service , sir . Have you been that busy you couldn 't come to the dock ? Oh , but I was . Let me explain . Come with me. I 'm on my way out . - Butler , that 's all . - Yes , sir . - Who are they ? - My assistants . They 've gone . That 's that taken care of ! Tiger is on our backs and you 're still prancing about ! It may not bother you , but it bothers me . You taught me to how to dress , how to walk , how to talk , how to negotiate , how to fight . You treat me like a puppet . Aren 't you bothered about that ? He 's right . The car . - That 's what you should be doing . - That 's what you think . - What do you think you should do ? - What I 'm doing right now . - This makes you happy ? - Do I look happy ? - Continue with what you 're doing . - l will . - Go on , then . - l would if I knew what I was doing . Imported goods are excellent here . - Have you got any currency ? - Not yet . - l 'll lend you some . - How kind . - When are you floating your company ? - Soon . He 's worth a fortune . He even owns a goldmine . And the shipyard and the steelworks . Go and find the reporters . I 'll handle this . Mr Wong , how much are the shares worth ? One dollar . $ 2.80 once they 're floated . Double your selling price ? - There are no outside buyers . - Can I buy some ? You 're not an outsider , nephew . Nephew , I 'm one of them . Inspector Ho , Chairman of the planning committee , police club . That 's the police club . I 'm in charge of fundraising . Nephew , your charitable deeds are praiseworthy indeed . - Very good , very good . - Thank you . Are you all right ? I 'm just sighing . It 's no use sighing . You must enjoy life . I 'm sighing because the club needs $ 80,000 , but we 've only raised $ 15,000 in 3 years . That 's only about $ 60,000 short of the target . After the stocks are issued , I 'll see what I can do to help . Mr Wong ... I 'm sorry . I know all it takes is one word from you . You 're so clumsy . My son will treat Belle well . How can I say no to you ? Thank you for being my guide for the day . It 's nothing . Make a note of what I bought . I 'll pay you back soon . Consider it a deposit . Deposit ? You promised to sell me some shares . - Of course ! Take these to my room . - Yes , sir . Shall we sign the papers upstairs ? No , let 's say your ooffice tomorrow . The shares will be ready then . Fine . Mr Wong , I 'll accompany you to your room . - There 's no need . - l insist . I 'd really like a cup of cooffee right now . - Let 's have a cooffee , then . - Fine . - No cooffee ? - l 'd better go back to my room . Back to your room . Why don 't you call the station ? - Call the station ? - ln case they 're looking for you . - lt 's all right . - Call to please me , then . - l will . - l 'll wait here . - l 'll go to the ladies . - l 'll come . - No , you go to your mother . - OK . - Why is he tagging along ? - He wants to . - Don 't let him . - l 'm doing my best .

He 's just gone to the restroom . We can 't leave yet . Come , come . Sit down and speak slowly . I 've no time . Floating in three months ! They didn 't sell as well as they thought ? Thank you . - Excuse me . - One moment . Yes , sir ? - ls Mr Wong living here ? - Yes . is that ... ? He 's over there . - A friend of yours ? - A small business matter . Hey ! Nothing. I 'm rich !

Stop , I 'll get you ! What 's the matter ? What 's the matter ? I think the gangsters are fighting . I 'll take my leave of you . Have dinner with us tonight . We 'll be there . I 'm not going to talk business any more. I 'll stay and have tea . - Don 't bring them here for tea . - lt 's diofficult to control them . - You 'd better stay here . - Sit down again ? Take them to the room . I 'd prefer to stay and have tea and stay for dinner too . All right . Mr Kuo , the press . - How did they get in ? - Bribery , I suppose . And that 's why I came to Hong Kong . is that so ? A photo , if you don 't mind ? Fine , fine . - Mr Wong . - Chen Wah , I 'm glad you 're here . Come , let 's have a group photo . Everybody join in . - A photo , Dad ? - This way . Good . Altogether . Altogether . Ready , set ... Thank you . Auntie , come and sit down . - A moment . What paper are you with ? - The Sun . - When will it be published ? - Tomorrow . Get the flower , then we can go . - Good luck . - You 're very busy . - Do you really believe that ? - lt 's not a matter of belief . Why haven 't you introduced your friend ? Why does he hide behind you ? He 's shy . You must excuse me now . - Chen Wah , I want to say something . - What is it ? Madam Kao has consented to a Shanghai wedding . In Shanghai ! Congratulations ! Madam Kao , thank you for your hospitality and consent to this marriage . You 're very kind . My trip is so brief and I 've missed so many people . I suggest an engagement party with all the Hong Kong dignitaries and your friends . What do you think ? - Chen Wah , what do you think ? - Me ? I 've no objection . Then it 's settled . Good idea . Kill two birds with one stone . Mr Wong , please , excuse me . Chen Wah , for an engagement in Hong Kong , all the vips must be invited . All right . You take care of it . Did you get that ? Western style is more grand . Eastern style is more relaxed . Do your Chinese friends outnumber foreign friends ? We have more Chinese than foreign friends . Cousin , cousin . He 's calling you . Sorry , shall we discuss the guest list ? Luming , come here . We need to talk about it . - Sorry . - No , no , go . Sit for a while . Madam Kao , any other ideas ? Lots of foreign friends ? How are we to get VlPs to attend ? Nothing is impossible to you . Thanks for the confidence . Mr Wong is making such a big fuss about everything . It 's all your fault . Simple , you said . Just get a suite , buy some new clothes , a little make-up . It 's one thing after another . Kidnapping reporters and businessmen . Beating up police . This is a mess . But you just said you were happy . Shut up ! You started all this . Fix it ! It 's a bit late to start blaming me . You helped Madam Kao as well . - Helping people is a good thing . - Correct . - But you must know your limits ! - You 're just making it worse ! You are all right . It 's me that 's wrong . This is not a mistake . It is. I have too much sympathy , but not enough ability . Trying to help Madam Kao perform miracles . You 're right. I don 't measure up . Please tell her we 've done all we can. I 've no more to give . At this stage ? - When should I tell her ? - You 'll ruin the marriage . - lmagine we never helped her . - That 's rich . Yes , I 'm getting out now . I won 't tell her , I 'm not so cruel . - You ... - l won 't . - Tell her . - No . I 'll tell her , then . Uncle . Auntie , Dad . - We 're not interrupting ? - Not at all . - What 's the matter ? - Mum says you 're very kind . You are very big hearted , so ... So , we 'd like you to be godfather to our first baby . - Godfather ? - You wouldn 't refuse us ? We won 't keep you any longer . Auntie . Bye-bye , Uncle . Godfather , what an idea . Get all the bosses and their women to pose as VlPs . Why are you staring ? is it a bad idea ? It 's a good idea . But they won 't look the part . Dress them up . - l 'll teach them etiquette . - l 'll do make-up . - Go to work. I 'll make some calls . - Let 's go . Do you know what you 're doing ? - What 's up ? - He tried to run away . Run away ? I can 't cope. I just want to go home . - How are you going to get there ? - By boat or train . What about in a wheelchair ? I 'm not going. I have work to do . Let 's go . Everyone 's assignment is written here . This is yours , remember it . This is yours . Take it easy . I might be pregnant and have to have an abortion . You don 't even know who the father is . Stop fidgeting . Please , you 're ladies now . You must be civil to each other . She 's always bad mouthing others . She already has a gut , and she 's still eating . Breathe in . What are you looking at ? Straighten up . Remember your lines . People ! People ! Tong gave each of you a piece of paper with your part . Your name and what to say . Remember your lines . Speak Mandarin . Mr Wong is from Shanghai . Don 't start yet . Just remember your part and act like ladies and gentlemen . Why should we ? He might be more vulgar than I am . Who are you ? The Secretary of Education . Education ? How could he be more vulgar than you ? - Why ? - That 's why . Your face doesn 't fit the part . Who 's the Chief Warden ? Who 's got that paper ? You 're the Chief Warden . Why didn 't you reply ? I don 't know. I can 't read . Can 't read ? ! What do you mean ? All right , you be the warden and you be the secretary . - You must be crazy ! - What 's the matter ? He felt me up . Help me out here , be civilised . It was all a mistake . - Bastard , molesting my bird ! - You dare to hit me ? Don 't fight ! Let me go ! Stop it ! Stop acting like this ! Stop fighting ! Listen to me ! Stop fighting ! Listen to me . Aren 't you tired of all this fighting and killing ? This may be your only chance in life to do a good deed . You might not understand why you have to help Madam Kao . Just think - when you 're old and your children ask , " Dad , what are your proudest achievements in your life ? " What should you say ? Do you tell them you were a gangster , opening brothels , casinos , racketeering ... Does this make you proud ? This may be the only thing you can tell them . - Do you understand ? - No ! Tong , Tong ! I 'm here ! I told you they weren 't to carry guns . I did tell them . Ask who else is carrying a gun ! Who 's still got a gun ? Me ! Take all their guns away ! I told you not to and you still did . " The Ritz " Here 's $ 5,000 from the Ho 's and $ 5,000 from me . That 's not too greedy , is it ? That 's not greedy . I 'll give you the shares . - Do you need to count it ? - No need . Thank you . When did the two reporters leave ? I went back to work . I don 't know when they left . Sign here . Mr Wong . Will there be anything else ? I 'm going to a party tonight . - Who 's that ? - Mr Wong , the Shanghai magnate . He 's the multi-millionaire , Mr Wong ? Thank you . Thank you , Mr Wong . Thanks for looking out for me . No need . You 've been most attentive . If we don 't look out for each other , who will ? How much did we spend last time ? - Don 't worry about it . - l insist ! Here 's $ 2,000 for your trouble . - So much money ? - Keep it . It 's chicken feed to me , but it 's a quite a bundle to you . Remember , once the shares hit two dollars , sell them . - Double ? - Don 't be too greedy . I 'll be rich . I can 't believe this bunch of paper is so valuable . It 's only paper . Remember , these shares are in high demand . Don 't tell anyone I gave them to you . Remember , once they 've doubled , sell immediately . I 'm leaving now . 30,000 shares ? Mr Wong . Mr Wong , sir . What about the police club ? Oh , that ? It 's a good thing I have one cheque left . Thanks very much , sir . Spending more money . There . $ 80,000 ? That 's too much ! - lt 's only $ 65,000 . - That was my last cheque . The next time I 'm in town , I 'll write you another . I 'll rip this one up . No need , I 'll give you the change . Change ? Where are you going to get $ 15,000 ? I have it . Can you keep a secret ? I 've got some evidence money . I 'll get it for you . Mr Wong , there 's $ 13,000 . Add my $ 2,000 , that makes $ 15,000 . Nephew , you are so clever . Thank you on behalf of the Ho 's , the police and myself . Thank you , thank you . Such small things , unworthy of mention . Let go . Till we meet again . Mr Wong , let me see you out . There 's no need . Look after your shares . Don 't let anybody see them . Remember , double . Double . Lucky me . Hey , you , stop ! Me ? What 's the matter ? Don 't move . Watch him and don 't let him go . I 'm a friend of Inspector Ho . Some friend ! Great ! Watch him . So that 's that . Chief Inspector Ho . What have you been doing ? There are so many missing persons and you haven 't found any ! We 've got some leads . The gang who 's doing the kidnapping is diofferent from the extortion gang . - What 's the diofference ? - Well ... Commandant . Chief Inspector . - Why didn 't you knock ? - lt 's very urgent . This discussion is very urgent . We haven 't received any ransom notes . Fool ! Even HQ has heard about this . Find all the missing persons in three days or one of us gets fired . See ? Get the car ready ! - Damn him ! - Chief Inspector ! Did you send men to the Ritz ? I did so , sir ! - Remember , you are responsible . - Understood , sir . Idiot ! It 's me . - You come in without knocking again ? - lt 's very urgent . Urgent ? Where have you been all day ? - l went to King 's Hotel . - l didn 't tell you to go there . But I found something out about Mr Wong . I tell you do one thing , you do another . You disobey my orders . - Hear me out first . - You don 't respect my authority . But ... Why did you disobey my orders ? Don 't you know my boss is after me ? - l know ... - Then why don 't you go after them ? I am about to be fired - and the rest of you , too . Nobody is looking out for me . Why are you here ? Obstructing justice . That 's a capital ooffence ! - ls that true ? - He 's crazy . Any leads on the missing persons ? - No , but we found Mr Wong ... - Nothing ? After all this time ? Idiot ! And your mother asked me to promote you ! Promote you to the heavens . What 's this about Mr Wong , then ? Speak ! I found out he 's not one of Shanghai 's ten richest men . He isn 't. I suppose you are . Do you look the part ? Just say who he is . Go on ! Go on ! 'Bastard ! ' Not only is he one of Shanghai 's richest men , but he 's one of the richest men in all China ! Well done , well done , that 's very good indeed . I don 't need you to tell me that ! Get out ! 'l must get away . ' Chief Inspector . - You still didn 't knock ? - Can I take some holiday ? - Holiday ? - Mother is sick . - ls you father sick , too ? - No . Get out ! Don 't ever come back ! - You look down . Was it that bad ? - l 'm going on holiday . Be smart , like me . I 've got some new leads . Work hard and you 'll get there . Mr Wong , you 're still here ? - l 'll just see him ooff . - Take Mr Wong back to the hotel . I will , I will. I 'll take him wherever he wants to go . Bye-bye , Mr Wong . Walk carefully . Where are you taking me ? I know where l 'm going . I don 't know about you . Chief Inspector ! - Why does nobody knock any more ? - Sorry Chief . I saw Kuo 's men with guns at the Ritz . Something 's up . Who are they ? Thieves , criminals , all those on our wanted list . Then why did you leave ? Get some men over there and arrest them ! I 'll get the warrant . Why are you standing there ? Give me my hat . What are you all staring at ? Follow us . And that 's the truth ? Yes . Apparently , their people are at the Ritz . What about the two boys we sent ? No news whatsoever . It backs up what I said . Kuo did take two of your men . Why are you doing this ? I just want the killings to stop . One , two , three , bow . That was great . This is a dress rehearsal . Luming will be Wong . Make an eoffort . I 'm Mr Wong . And you are ? I 'm Miss Foxy , the Rotary Chair person . You 're Miss Fox , the Rotary Chair person . What is this Foxy ? That was my Mandarin . Stick to Cantonese . - l 'm Mr Wong , and you are ? - l 'm the Governor of Hong Kong . You 're not the Governor , you 're the Minister for Transportation . I want to be Governor . Why ? If he 's Police Commissioner , I 've got to be Governor . I must be Governor . Don 't take it so seriously . I must outrank him. I 'm the Governor . He insists on being Governor . Fine ! Let him be Governor , then . - Run through it again . - One more time . Please , cooperate . Boss , Mrs Shun wants to see you . Once again . One , two , three and bow . Boss , the police have surrounded the place . - Right outside ? - Yes . What is it ? - The police have us surrounded . - Police ? How come ? They 're waiting for Inspector Ho to come with a warrant . He must think we 're starting a gang war . We can 't leave and Madam Kao is waiting. lt 's nearly time . Oh , dear , we 'll be found out for sure . This is bad . The poor woman . - What shall we do ? - Search me . - What shall we do ? - He 's the boss . Come on , think ! What shall we do ? I 'll go to the courthouse to get Inspector Ho . - You can 't go out . What can you do ? - l don 't know . We 'll have to play it by ear . I 'll go out the back way . - What are you doing ? - The drinks . Forget that . Go up and practise . Tell Uncle I 'm going to court . I 'll contact him when I meet Ho . Tell him to wait for me . Move on . What are you doing there ? - What should we do ? - Ring Fei . Push harder . The boys must be looking for me . Thanks . He 's gone to the courthouse to get Ho . - All set ? - Yeah , we know what to do . What 's that ? They found the bodies of your men . Kuo had them killed . He killed my men ? Where is he ? What 's he up to ? He 's gone to get Inspector Ho . For what purpose ? Maybe he 's working with the police . Damn it ! Let 's go ! I 've got to leave now . I 'll look your boss up after this . - What now ? - l 'm hungry . - Me , too . - Let 's go . I can 't find him anywhere . There he is . Let 's go ! - My leg ! - My hand ! - You broke my pots ! Pay up ... - Damn you ! Hold it ! Don 't run ! We 've got you now . Get ready . The guests will be here soon . Make sure there are enough drinks . I 'll see to it . Relax . Problems ? No , they 're rehearsing the entrance . There 's plenty of time . Don 't worry . - Where is he ? - Up there . - Get him down . - Bring him down . Tiger , sorry for not having tea with you . Damn it ! I liked you . I promise to have tea with you , but you 've got to let me go now . It 's very urgent . Let you go ? I sent two boys to invite you to tea . - You killed them . Why ? - l didn 't. I set them free . Where 's my gun ? Didn 't you hear what I said ? I didn 't kill them . They 'll be back soon . Brother Fei , tell him I didn 't kill them . But you did . The bodies have been found . That 's impossible . Tiger , don 't believe him . He 's evil . He 's making fools of us both . He never liked me anyway . They 'll be back soon , believe me . Where are they , then ? - They must be on their way back . - To avenge their deaths ? Damn it , don 't string me along ! Tiger , believe me . I didn 't kill them ! Tiger ! Tiger ! Can you kill me later ? I 've got urgent business to attend to . Shut up ! I 'll kill you now . Here they are . I told you I didn 't kill them . - Why aren 't you two dead already ? - Not yet . He saved us . - He set us free . - Damn it , you scared me . Tiger , I told you I didn 't lie to you . So , you creep , you want to be the boss ? Tiger , I did it for you . I would make a much better boss . There 's no way you could be better ! Release him ! Take it easy ! Tiger , I hope you understand . I did this for your own good . From now on , keep out of our family aoffairs . Your family aoffairs ! No problem . I got him . Stop him if you can . Tiger , I will certainly have tea with you . Brother Fei , as you pointed out , this is a family aoffair . Let 's go and sort it out . I 've got urgent business , excuse me . Don 't think you 're going to leave here alive . Tiger . I won 't interfere , but rules are rules. I 'll keep the guns for you . Canton kid , have no fear . I 'll make sure there 's no foul play . But I might be dead by then . Get him and the factory is yours . Get him ! Out of the way ! Brother , you 're good . Stop. I 've got to go . Can we finish this later ? Grab him . He 's over there ! Pull the rope . Thank you , Buddha ! Don 'tjump ! I told you not to . Stop fighting ! Don 't go away. lt 's your turn now . You were great . Brother Chen Wah . You 've done one thing right , the factory hands are behind you . You can have the factory and we can be family again . - Thank you , Chen Wah . - l 've got to go now . Canton kid , I really admire you . Your family aoffair is settled . We 've done our bit . Let 's be friends . I don 't have time . Still thinking of the beating I gave you ? Hit me back , then . Go on , don 't be afraid . - Stand back ! - Don 't move ! Great fistwork . Canton kid , you fight really well . Now , go on , slap me . Good friends we shall be . Friend , I 've got to go now , urgent business . If anything happens , count me in . Count your ass . What 's the hurry ? Shandong man , lend me your car . - What ? - l 'm borrowing your car . - How was that ? - Perfect , just right . Chief Inspector , you 're wanted . Inspector Ho . Go out and keep watch . Inspector , take your men away . Inspector , please ... How did you get out ? - Inspector ... - Stand up ! Inspector Ho , please , remove them . We 're doing a good thing at the Ritz . Putting you lot away is the good thing . What are you doing here ? I told you to find the missing men . Sir ... The Attorney General just chewed my ass ! From now on , your only job is to find the missing persons or you 'll go missing ! I know the whereabouts of the missing persons . - Who 's this ? - The owner of the Ritz . is that true ? Four reporters , two businessmen , right ? Yes , this is why I brought him to see you . Follow me . You too . The missing persons ' case is most urgent , we must deal with it first . Order them to search the Ritz . No , they 're getting ready for Madam Kao 's party . It 's an order . The missing are not in the Ritz . Where are they ? Free my friends and I 'll tell you . First let me make a call . - l can 't ... - lf l don 't , they won 't free them . Things could get ugly . - All right , make your call . - Thank you . - Hello ? - Luming . - Tell Uncle to release them . - The reporters ? Tell Madam Kao we can 't come . Tell the brothers it 's all ooff . What now ? What now ? One more time . Make it better . There 's no need . Everything 's cancelled . - Why did you kidnap them ? - To keep the secret . - The secret of your crimes ? - Hold your tongue ! - What secret ? - A lady 's secret . What has she to do with you ? Nothing , really. I just buy a rose from her every day . I know nobody will believe me . We believe you , but we don 't understand the kidnapping . That 's exactly why . You won 't understand . You see , her daughter has a rich boyfriend , they 've just graduated . They 're getting married here . This scared the mother , so she lied about her background . She 's got a heart of gold and would never lie . When I arrived in Hong Kong , she told me to be careful . A conman had already taken my last cent. I bought a rose for luck . You ladies will understand the love between a mother and her daughter . So I kidnapped the men , but they 're OK .

 Not bad . The lady in the lake . Hey you 're supposed to be keeping an eye out for crocodiles . I am . No ! Remove your covering . I beg your pardon ? Show yourself to me . I think you 've already seen more than your fair share . - You are not dismissed . - Hey ! first lesson little boy . No , means no . You struck me . A transgression of the gravest order , as I will bare witness your highness . - Highness ? - You 've got to be kidding . No woman may touch King Gawain . Kill her . Wait ! There is one woman who may touch the King . But your highness . His betrothed . As in marriage ? Sire ... I do not think it wise . I 'm with tall dark and moody here . As far as husbands go I 've always had something a little larger in mind . Then die you must . On the other hand , I 've always hoped to be a June bride . What about the dowry sire ? Veronica , why don 't go back to the treehouse and get the dowry and bring as many of them as you can . Got it . Do you know the meadow by the stream ? I will send a guide to escort you from there ... if you are not back at our camp by nightfall . Don 't worry , I 'll be there . At the dawn of the century A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible ... The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations ... and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World Back so early ? Put your boots on boys , we 're going to a wedding . Who ever would have thought I would be putting together Marguerite 's dowry hmmm ? Well , well , well . Ah yes always a safe wedding gift . Likewise for this . Oh I know it must be somewhere in here . Whoa , that 's Marguerite 's jewelry . I know . She 'll have a fit . How often does a lady get married ? Yes well , her wedding your funeral . After we 're married , I 'll throw a grand ball in your honor at the castle . Castle ? This is just my hunting camp , my kingdom lies many days journey away . - You know your highness ... - You may call me by my given name Gawain . Okay , Gawain ... about this grand ball . It 's not that I don 't think you 're cute , handsome I mean . But can you really see the two of us . - I mean I 'm old enough to be your ... - Mother ? Sister is more what I had in mind . Vordred ! My King . I am to be married am I not ? Indeed . A grand and glorious celebration foretold in legend ? Most assuredly . Then why are we not flying the royal flags as I commanded ? Ah , alas sire , your knights have reported ape-men approaching on our territory . Headhunters have been sited to the East and well would there were more hours in the day . You have one hour . As you command . So hard to get good help these days . Okay - let 's try this once again from the top . You have a very beautiful body . How old did you say you were ? Lovely eyes ... why don 't you smile for me . You 're not listening . Our union is pre-destined ... from the moment you rose from the water ... like the lady in the lake . I was taking a bath . Gawain , listen ... this is real life ... and there aren 't any white knights in shining armor . Believe me I know . It 's just a fairy tale . No , this is our history ... and now you will be part of it . News from the border scouts my lord . I think you 'll be pleased . Speak . The woman has been spotted ... there are two men with her . How timely , Make sure they are appropriately greeted . Yes , my lord I knew you 'd be pleased ... Now . Their quest for the Holy Grail stranded my ancestors in this world , so they built a new kingdom here a new Camelot . In the middle of the jungle ? It hasn 't been easy . Over the centuries the dragon has claimed many lives including those of my parents . Dragon ? Oh of course the dragon . It is said only one who is true of heart can slay the creature . This is Esme she will fit you . Fit me ? Your wedding dress , my lady . Oh really so soon ? You know speaking from personal experience I 've found that long engagements usually work out the best . The wedding will take place as planned . What about the invitations , china patterns , finding a decent caterer ? Silence . By sunset tomorrow you will be my Queen Let 's hope you 've got something in off white . What 's wrong ? We 've been here for an hour . You 're sure this is the right place ? They said due west of the river . So is Africa . Well we can 't just leave her . - Tempting . - Yeah ! but I guess not . Take a look . What do we have here ? It must be the Kings escort . I 'm not so sure about that , look closer . It seems we 've already worn out our welcome . Don 't we always . Heads up everybody , let 's not kill anyone unless we have to . Halt What the hell was that all about ? Marguerite must be in more trouble than we thought . Well then let 's get a move on . I think that was our cue to leave . She has a way of doing that . Oww , I need to breathe , don 't I. I get the feeling there 's something you 'd like to share . Not at all my lady . Didn 't need that rib anyway . Look Esmy you must know the routine around here pretty well . I , it 's true . Is there any way someone could escape ... hypothetically speaking of course ? They could drop down a deep well ne 'er to be heard from again . I was thinking more along the lines of dark night , swift horse . I 'll take that as a no . I 've been the King 's nurse since the day he was born I have . I 'm amazed he survived this long . It 's not fair ... the weight of the Kingdom on the shoulders of a boy . Then help me stop him from making a mistake . Don 't see it myself , - some would say pretty I suppose . - Thanks . Your lips speak pleasant enough ... but your eyes always looking somewhere else they are . It 's true . I don 't love him , he 's just a boy . He 's my King and he wants you ... so he shall have you , but if you 've ever harm him ... Queen or no Queen . I think we understand each other . May it soon be his head on that pole . The men were dispatched ? Yes , yes I think you 'll be pleased . Excellent we all know how dangerous these jungle tracks can be . Horrible such terrible ways to die . Shhh If I 'm not mistaken , I think we 're about ... to hear of the terrible tragedy now . Apparently you 're mistaken . You have failed . No , no , the brigands . I would rip out your tongue if I didn 't need it to lick my boots . Welcome ... strangers . So where 's the part where we blast our way out of this berg . One slight glitch the knights took all our weapons . They get nervous when armed strangers walk around their camp . You just handed over the guns ? Well we were a little out numbered . - It was either that or die . - No , excuse , excuses . My god Marguerite what the hell have you gotten us into this time . Is that any way to talk to a Queen . Future Queen , not to mention a royal pain in the ... Ugo , at your service ... shall I kill the unpleasant one now . Let me think about that . I 'm also well versed in several forms of torture . Marguerite ? On second thoughts no why should I have all the fun . You may leave us now . This is not a game . - I know that . - No you don 't . You 're playing with dynamite ... and it 's going to blow up right in our faces . There you see that anger , the way they quarrel . No you are wrong Vordred . I 'm afraid not sire . I know the signs . Those two are obviously in love . I have claimed her , I am King . Yes as was Arthur but did that stop Lancelot ? What are you saying ? The gallant young King betrayed by his Queen and her shining knight . They would not dare . Have I not always counseled you wisely ? After your parents died did I not take you under my wing ? Arthur showed Lancelot mercy and Camelot fell . That man , my brave young king , is your Lancelot . The fate of your empire hangs in the balance . I pray you do not make Arthur 's mistake . It 's Camelot in the jungle I couldn 't even have written this . Now 's your chance put that writer 's imagination to work . We need a happy ending for Marguerite . Not to mention the rest of us . What is it ? Look whose back for more . Easy we don 't have any weapons . You fools why do the strangers live ? - Cold blooded murderer . - Shhh Now you know what has to be done . Go and finish the job you failed so miserably at . Make sure there 's no connection to me , go . Something 's rotten in Camelot . Over here boys . Hurry I 'm waiting . So am I. Okay let 's talk . So you have no idea who the attackers were ? We freed the kingdom of bandits years ago . No one would dare trespass on my territory . You see it 's impossible . Yes well impossible or not - it happened . Yes well as you claim . Are you calling me a liar ? Sit down sir , you forget where you are . Why would he make up a story like that ? I wouldn 't presume to understand his motivations . - All right on your feet . - Roxton . dynamite remember ? You were right okay . Do you really think this will work ? You heard them , Vordred 's going to try and topple the King . We 'll need our guns . Even if we find them , who 's going to believe us ? Anyone who doesn 't want to get shot . Nothing you ? - No . - One more shot . Some of the knights must be loyal to the King . How do we know who 's on our side and who 's on Vordreds ? They try to kill us they 're not on our side . Piece of cake . Hurry up . What did I tell ya ... pay dirt . Charming ... why not try ... yes why not try . Another time . Veronica ? - What 's happened ? - What is the meaning of this ? I think you 'll be pleased . Well speak . I caught them going after their weapons . Ah hah you see Gawain you are in danger . Only not from us . This man plans to kill you and takeover your kingdom . My lord you see how clumsily they try to confuse and deceive us . Look buster if anybody 's a little shady around here . You must believe us . Your life is in danger . I 've seen no evidence . Gawain - listen to me . I believe them . Of course you do , you 're one of them . Who would you believe your future wife or the prince of darkness here ? Vordred has been my adviser all my life . Yet how can I not believe the woman I love ? There is one way that we can be certain . Let the strangers face the dragon . Dragon ? T-Rex . If they are true of heart ... then they will return with the dragons tooth . But if not ... then this one will be sacrificed for the treasoner she most surely is . You ! - No please if you do love me . - He 's right ... if you speak the truth a sword and a true heart is all you 'll need . Sword ? Against a T-Rex ? - It 's murder . - Silence . King has spoken . It 's not too late to stop this . - I have given my command . - So given other one . I 'm not a custom to taking orders from a woman . And I am not a custom to begging . Please , Gawain they 're my friends . And I am your King . You 're not a King you 're an arrogant child , spoiled little brat . Vordred warned me this would happen . You love him . Who ? - The one called Roxton . - Oh , please . I may be only a boy but I know something of the ways of men and women . You know nothing . How dare you speak to your King that way ! It takes more than a crown to call yourself a King . Halt ! I have not given you permission to leave ! Marguerite ! Please . Yes ? Your highness . - Is something amiss ? - Of course not be gone wench , you will do my bidding later . Now what ? The dragon hunts on the other side of the valley . Here . Where 's mine ? The squire does not get a sword . Squire ? It wasn 't my idea . Why not just kill us . See - if the dragon kills us Vordred 's hands are clean . And not to worry if you 're pure of heart you have nothing to fear . Maybe the dragon will just give you his tooth . If it 'll make you feel any better you can hold the damn sword . Oh no you 're the knight . So , Sir Roxton what is the plan ? I haven 't a clue ... whoa wait up a second . Damn his foot is bigger than this sword . Don 't look at me I 'm just the squire . Tell that to him . Not bad in a pinch . Forget about the damn dress . You haven 't heard anything I 've said at all . Oh I missed a bit I did . Gawain trusts you . He 'd listen to you . Vordred 's no saint that 's for sure but killer , conspirator ? If he wanted the King dead why wait till now ? In case you haven 't noticed Gawain is becoming a man with a mind of his own . Not to mention a bride and God help me possibly an heir . If Vordred can seize control now Gawain 's kingdom will be his . Let 's say I believe you . It 's about time . All the more reason for the marriage to go ahead as planned . What ? King and Queen if Vordred 's mad for the throne he 'd have to kill both of you to get it . Great - What are you doing ? - My earring . What ? Yes ... yes a wedding present from our gracious King . Please , there 's a fine reward . - Reward ? - Yes ! Well where did it drop ? Over here . Hurry up . You 're welcome . I can hear someone coming . It 's just your imagination . Halt ! My imagination just brought a friend . What 's this ? after them . They 're right behind us . I know I know it 's so dark out here I can 't even see where I 'm going . - At this rate will never lose them . - All you try escaping in a dress . Come on . They can 't be far . - Where now ? - There ! Gotta hand it to you . That was a great idea . Don 't move . Don 't breathe . Like I said great idea . At least I brought us some ... they won 't stay fooled for very long . - They 'll be back any second . - I can 't . What ? We come all this way for you and now you want to stay ? How can I leave the poor kid in the clutches of the wicked stepfather ? Oh you picked a lousy time go soft . Think about it Vordred is going to kill him . Leaving him will be like sentencing him to death . In case you 've forgotten that 's just what they 've done to Roxton and Malone . You 're a better tracker than I am . You go find the men . I 'll go back and look after Gawain . That kid really got to you didn 't he ? They must be close . Go Why are you not in your bedchamber ? Who can sleep with all the noise ? Enter . Sire , the the woman has escaped . Locked in the stocks guarded by my knights ? She must have had help . I 've never been so insulted . Where were you tonight ? Not in your chamber I already looked . I bet you did . Well ? She was with me . I was ? I was . Sire , may I ? I have a witness the knight she knocked unconscious . Like yourself I certainly am aware of the woman 's ... charms , but where the security of the kingdom is at stake . You accuse me of lying ? No . No your grace not lying . Then what ? Nothing my mistake your highness . You lied for me . You 're right , I 'm not a King I 'm a fake . Gawain don 't . I should have known better . Only a fool rules with his heart and not his head . No not a fool just a man . That woman 's influence is growing . Soon I won 't be able to control him at all . Well desperate times call for desperate measures . What do you mean ? You feel that ? That 's the feel of power slipping through my fingers . Not very pleasant is it ? The King must not make it through his wedding alive . Now get to work . We 've been going in circles . You 're crazy . It 's the third time I 've seen that tree . We 've been all around this valley . If there 's a T-Rex around here we would 've heard by now . You were saying Malone ? I wonder if this is how Saint George did it ? Wonder later lets get the hell out of here . We can 't keep this up . - Any ideas ? - Yeah split up . What ? He can 't follow both of us . Me and my big mouth . Throw me the sword . Are you out of your mind ? Trust me . Oh yeah . Any time Malone ! Malone ! That 's it . Dammit Roxton ? Roxton ? Where the hell is everybody ? Good morning . Bad luck to see the bride , guess we 'll have to postpone . Speaking of bad luck . Not now this is a day of joy and celebration - and in that spirit ... - Vordred wants to make a wedding toast . He does , does he ? Blessed are we on this magnificent day . May the glory and the spirit of your love ... shine on all the kingdom of Gawain long live the King . Stop ! - Marguerite ? - Don 't drink . Your highness ? Explain yourself . Bad year I think . Enough foolishness now let us drink . No ! I don 't understand ? Poison - How dare you . - Really ? Sire I am insulted by this accusation . Insulted enough to drink the King 's wine ? Enough ! I 've had enough suspicions innuendos ! I 'm sick of it ! - I was only ... - Be gone get out of my sight . Come on you son of a bitch - where are you ? Make that ' Sir ' son of a bitch . I thought you were goner for sure . That makes both of us . It worked . Good job Malone . Now let 's clear some of these rocks , get our tooth and go home . Whoa how 'd you do that ? Just call him Saint George . Marguerite , Marguerite please wait . First you want me to leave now you want me to stay , make up your mind . What you did back there in front of Vordred , it was very brave , I was touched . Touched in the head . No , your concern for me was very moving . You 've got a funny way of showing it . Vordred chose most of the retainers for this hunting trip . - So ? - So , that wine was poisoned . It was . To force our hand now would be too dangerous . If Vordred 's allegiance is false , than who here can I trust ? So that was all an act ? If we can make it safely back to my kingdom I 'll have my loyal supporters , but here . You believe me ? How could I not believe my Queen ? Halt ! Let me pass . The King cannot be found . Pity that ; get out of me way . I know what you 're up to . You stop that . Spiriting our King to safety . You 're mad . No I 'm mad . Ugo Where is Gawain ? I would not betray my one true King . That 's admirable indeed . Gawain ! I will slice this woman into a million pieces if I have to ! You have one last chance ! No ! Well , well , well let 's put divine right to the test . Gawain no ! He is still a boy . Well then which of you have the courage to be the King 's champion ... and fight me to the death ... anyone ? You see I have no one . I have no champion . Oh I wouldn 't be so sure about that your highness . This one 's on me . So be it . Roxton are you sure about this ? Hell no . Please tell me this isn 't your first joust . Sorry but how hard can it be . All I have to do is stick him before he sticks me . Wouldn 't it be easier just to shoot him . Spoken like a faithful squire , but when in Rome or in this case Camelot . Now , shut up Malone and pass me my lance . Good luck Thanks I 'll need it . Ugo . Ugo . Be careful . Damn you to hell ! After you I insist . No ! Do you yield ? In front of your peers do you yield to my rule ? I yield . Then rise . Are you sure about this ? Vordred is my enemy but he is still a noble of the realm . He deserves a trial . No ! yield this Marguerite Ugo help me ! Not very pleasant - is it ? My knight in shining armor . A little blood but you 'll be fine , you 'll be fine . You fainted . I guess I did . What 's this ? Your friends are waiting outside for you . I don 't understand ? What about the wedding ? You already offered your life for me once . I don 't have the right to ask for that again . Especially when I know your heart belongs to someone else . I think that 's the nicest brush off I 've ever heard . Besides there 's much to do : Routing out conspirators solidifying allegiances forming a united realm . Then what ? Then hopefully I 'll be worthy of someone like you . You already are . Well looks who 's here . Hello everyone . You 'll never guess what happened to us ? You 're right why don 't you just tell us . - Do you know what this is ? - A flower . An orchid , correct . Ah yes but not just any orchid an entirely new variety . - Great ! - Okay . Fabulous . And what the hell have you lot been doing ? Apart from lounging around and making an awful mess . Well Marguerite almost married a boy King . Veronica was nearly executed by his evil grand vizier . But luckily Malone managed to slay the dragon with one sword . And Roxton won the joust , saving the King and his kingdom . Good try . Yes really . And we all lived happily ever after .

 It 's gotta be around here somewhere . There . I 'll go first , shall I ? No . None of us are going . - But The Voice told you that ... - I don 't care . It doesn 't feel right . I hope you 're hearing this . I don 't think we should be going up there . What 's her problem ? It 's her first time on the surface . Hel , you have to . Your target will be approaching any minute . Is she hearing The Voice now ? I certainly hope so . - I 'm not convinced that ... This is the best opportunity you 'll have to test our new shields against the Bailies . We need to investigate their new weapons . Let 's go . It 's really ugly . OTHER WOMAN : You 'll get used to it . Hear it ? - Is that what I think it is ? - Yeah . It 's a Bailey . What 's wrong ? Vertigo ? Yeah . Don 't worry . It 's normal for a first-timer . A little fire from a Bailey ought to clear your head . Probably take it right off actually . Hey , turn off your jamming device , Horst . We can 't try out this new stuff if it doesn 't find us . There . Won 't be long now . Showtime ! OK , Hel , do it . - It worked . - Unbelievable . Let 's go ! - Horst , you 're a robot ? A Betrayer robot . 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . In the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth Shield up . Shield 's weakening , Hel . - Come on , we 've got to get back to the lab . - Right behind you . Ugh ! Ugh ! - Hel , I 've been hit . - Hang in there , Sarge . We 're almost home . Hel ... why are all the cute ones robots ? We had some good times and he was just a machine . Of course , that does explain a few things . Argh ! Why couldn 't it be my left side ? I already lost that one . You only have one kidney ? - Didn 't I mention that ? What 's the delay ? Why aren 't you moving ? This is the new model Betrayer that 's after you . The only way to defeat it is to adapt the weaponry in the arm . Sarge is hurt . She needs help fast . The mission is more important . You have to get the arm to the lab . If we 're going to defeat the Bailies , we have to know what they 're made of . She won 't make it . I 'm getting her help . Come on . It says here she went for surgery in the year 2001 . Something went wrong when she was anaesthetised and they couldn 't wake her . She was frozen , I guess until they could find a cure . She 's fine . We 're gonna have some fun with her . I need a kidney ... for her . Ah , you 're in luck . We just acquired some cryogenically frozen bodies from the 21 st century . Mint condition . - What have you got to trade ? - I can give you this defence gauntlet . I wouldn 't give you an appendix for that piece of junk . We don 't take dated weaponry round here , sweetheart . - Got any drugs ? - Tobacco ? Slaves ? What 's that on your gauntlet ? You can 't give him that , Hel . It means too much . Hey , you want a kidney or not ? No . You 're important to me . Just hold on . - Ow ! - Here . Mm . Don 't see wood much any more . - Aaaah ! - It 's OK . - Give this girl a new kidney . - Come on . Let 's get you better . Most of the bodies have charts attached to the bags . Make sure you get the right blood type . - What about her ? - Oh , she 's ours . A guy can get ... lonely . Tell me if she moves . I 'll be down the hall , in the cat box . Let 's hope for her sake she never wakes up . - Are you ready ? - Yeah . You 'll be sore for a while . No pain , no gain . Where am I ? Mm . Are you doctors ? Mm . Good work . What are we going to do ? We can 't leave her here for these ghouls . Better off just killing her now . - Put her out of her misery . - Good point . Freeze ! Move and I 'll waste you ! - Relax ... No , no . You relax . - I just heard Shorty talking about killing me . - Shorty ? Go on , make my day . What ? I know what you two are asking yourselves . Does she know that weapon well enough to take us both ? Well ... do you feel lucky ? Huh ? Who are you ? 008 . Codename Cleopatra . Now , if you two don 't cooperate , I 'll have to finish you right here . Sarge ! Wait here . Hel , Sarge is in danger . You have to help her . Let 's go ! - Let 's go ! - I 'm coming ! - Something 's wrong . He 's only keying on you . - Why are we bringing her ? - It 's the right thing to do . - Did The Voice tell you that ? No , I 'm telling you that . Don 't ever scream like that again . Sarge , put your jamming device on . Shh . I know this is a dream . If someone were to pinch me ... - - Shh ! OK ... OK , it 's not a dream . What year is this ? It 's 2525 . Oh , my God . This can 't be happening . Everyone I love is gone . My whole world has been destroyed . Where are we ? - Where the hell are the elevato ... - Shut up ! Aarggh ! Gaa ! Gaa ! Gaa ! Gaa ! Get off me ! Sarge ! You don 't know how lucky you are . Packs quite a wallop for someone who cries so easy . - Easy ? ! - Shh ! You think it 's easy to go in for a basic boob job in year 2001 and wake up five centuries later ? - What 's a boob job ? - Uggh ! Let 's head back down before he gets another read on you . Hold on tight . Ready ? - So all that stuff about 008 ? - I made it up . You were very convincing . Well , thanks . I did study acting for two years at Glendale Community College . So is Cleopatra your real name ? Stage name . I do a little exotic dancing to pay the bills . Exotic dancing ? Stripping , all right ? OK ? There , I said it . Happy ? So why would someone get an operation like that ? If those are real , congratulations . I , on the other hand , wasn 't so lucky . So I had to help nature along a little bit . Sue me . And who may this be ? It 's a long story , Mauser , but for now ... she 's one of us . - - Down , girl , he 's a robot . Not even programmed for sex ... yet . - A Bailey arm ! - Make it fast . There 's a Betrayer that 's keyed in on Sarge . Toughest model we 've seen yet . Voice thinks something in there might help us defeat him . Did windows go out of style ? We don 't need windows down here . We live underground . - Why ? - Centuries ago , no-one 's quite sure when , the Bailies came down , took over the surface of the Earth - and drove humankind underground . - What 's a Bailey ? If you don 't know , then obviously it happened after you were frozen . She 's ... pre-Bailey ? Concentrate on your work , Mauser . Hey , do you guys have anything I can wear ? I mean , I 'm not really wild about this whole futuristic thing you 're all into , but ... anything 's better than 400-year-old gauze . You 're very concerned about the way you look , aren 't you ? You 're very concerned about the way you look , aren 't you ? Like those exposed midriffs of yours are functional ! You sounded just like Sarge then . Oh . I have been told I 'm an excellent mimic . I see why The Voice thinks this may be useful in destroying the Betrayer . The weapon in this arm is the most advanced I 've ever seen . I could rig it for use in a few minutes . We have time ... don 't we ? No . Hurry up . He 's closing in on Sarge . We 're gonna die here , aren 't we ? If we can 't distract him long enough for Mauser to finish that weapon , I 'd say yes . Talk like Sarge . Do you really think it 's time for me to do impersonations ? That Betrayer is keyed in on Sarge . Do it ! You 're very concerned with the way you look , aren 't you ? Again . Come on , big boy . Hel . Hey , Horst . Surprise ! So ... getting used to things down here ? Actually , I was just wondering if maybe you can freeze me again . Just tape a note to my head that says I should be woken up when things have gotten better . Look , we 're fighting a war to regain the surface of the Earth . Things aren 't going to get better until we win . Now ... we 'll look after you . So why don 't you join us ? All for one and one for all . Whoopee . What did you just say ? All for one and one for all . That 's beautiful . Yeah . Really tells it like it is with us . It 's catchy It 's very inspiring . I got a million of ' em . Next week : 102 Creegan

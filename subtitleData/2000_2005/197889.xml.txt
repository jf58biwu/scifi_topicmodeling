Subs patched together by : Cobura a.k.a. s13 3 years has past ever since Noriko and I escaped from that island . Many students died from the BR Act . But nobody could stop me and Noriko from fighting back . The world is now in the age of terrorism . The anti-BR act organization ' Wild Seven ' leader , Nanahara Shuya , is wanted for his acts . The adults started a new game in the name of ' Justice ' . 'New Century Terrorist Counter-measure Alternative ' . Also known as ' Battle Royale II' The dice has been thrown . We will never forget the adults who made us kill each other . Let us stand together . Let us fight together . We are declaring war to all adults . BATTLE ROYALE II : REQUIEM 3 years ago , my father , who was a teacher , was shot by his own student . The picture my father finished painting had a drawing of a girl . When I found out that it wasnt me , I never went to school again . And now , I 've decided to join the game to confront my feelings about my dad . - Wanted for Murder and Accessory - Nanahara Shuya , Nakagawa Noriko - BRII Bright , cheerful , fun - Thank you for registering ! And so I enrolled at Shikanotoride Middle School . A ragtag collection of losers and delinquents from across all of Japan . - We 'd all been written off by adults . - Buncha jocks ! None of us had any real future . For me , the only thing that felt real was my pain . Shit ! - Friends ~ Shintaro - You too , Taku . Not me . Why not ? Sign it . You 've graduated . Nothing 's finished yet . Hey , Hey ! Shintaro ! - Hey ! ? - What the hell ! ? To you , the 10 million fans of the BR Act . The bus has just arrived under extreme tight security . This time , ...

But even under those hellish conditions , their smiles were always those of pride . The open smiles of the children . So what ? What the hell 's that got to do with us ? What are you fighting for now ? Listen , kill me and the game 's over . But would your struggle end ? Can you forget all this , and resume your old lives ? Then what are you fighting for ? They all died because of you ! We 'll keep on fighting ! Even if we have to fight against every adult in the world . Until the day that we can smile in the same open way as the children we saw . Shuya ! Special Forces are approaching our base . Here we go ! Back to our hideout ! All of us here either survived a game or lost family . We 're not your enemies . Let 's go ! You too ! Wait ! Jin ! Hey ! Taku ! You kids stay back ! Hide ! I don 't have a clue to what the hell your pulling . How does it feel ? To murder others , to survive alone . You aim a gun , you shoot it . This is what it takes to survive . Yuuma ? Yuuma ? ! Yuuma ! Down ! HQ ! This is Mamiya ! The students have gone over to the terrorists ! We 're being slaughtered ! Send reinforcements ! Sir ! Sir ? Shit ! You kids are just a bunch of brats ! Shit , you got me . I have ... a family too ... The rain kept falling ... Day Three - 12 / 25 - Christmas Nozomi . Hang on Nozomi . With only the moans of dying echoing heavily in our minds . Nozomi ! Nozomi ! Sagisawa ! Sagisawa ! I 'm sorry , Sagisawa . I ... I ... Survive . All of you , survive ... Don 't forget about me . Don 't for ... get ... Nozomi ! Sagisawa ! Girl # 6 Nozomi Sagisawa . DEAD . 10 To Go We 've lost another friend . Now , what are we supposed to do ? Answer me ! There 's no answer . You 've got to find it for yourself . Taku ! We never had anywhere we could go , I knew that all along . No place to call our home . You 're all fighting for your lives ! This is war right ? But die and you 're just one more victim . Even those poor little kids . You 're all the same . You 're no better than the adults ! How I wish this war would end . I keep on asking myself : How can I answer all those who have died ? I don 't know ... But inevitably , we 'll all grow up to become adults . The best survivors can do , is to remember the ones who died . Always and forever . Even after we grow up . Hello ? Hello ... What are you doing ? I told you to knock . You stink . Don 't come in here . Listen , today 's your birthday right ? I thought that you , mom and I could go out . - You 're the worst . - What ? My birthday was yesterday . Isn 't it today ? It was yesterday . Just get out . Listen , Shiori ... Still got more to say ? What ? I guess , I should ... do this , right ? What an idiot . The thing people fear most , isn 't death , but being forgotten . We 're all here now . We all wanted someone to know . You 'll be just fine , just fine . You don 't keep losing your temper because you 're sick . If you make friends at this school , you 'll get better . Because all the kids here are just like you . I promise I 'll come and get you . Please , let 's go . One day , they 'll all disappear . Family , friends ... But I 'll always be by your side . I can 't do anything for you , but I 'll be there . I promise ... Nobu ... Kawada , all you guys ... I 'm not wrong , am I ? I 'm fighting along ... with the best of you , right ? You OK ? Mimura ! Run ! Shit ! Blowing away a couple of guys won 't change a thing in this country ! But I don 't know any other way . Survive this ! And don 't look back ! And then , finally the rain stopped . How much blood has been shed ? How many tears spilled ? All of our friends who fought beside us are dead , killed in the last 3 years . But even as justice can never be vanquished , we terrorists will never vanish , however evil they deem us . Because we know , that a handful of adults , selfishly define the nature of peace as freedom in this world . But our world is so much more complex than theirs . This world has 63 Billion people living their own lives , living 63 billion different ways , 63 billion kinds of peace , 63 billion kinds of justice , 63 billion kinds of war and evil . And no one has achieved peace ... without fighting for it . Behind every peace , there 's a river of blood , sweat and tears . It 's going live to global host computers . But if we avert our eyes from that history and abandon it , then peace might as well be dogshit . Dogshit , huh ... ? Japan , China , North Korea , Guatemala , Indonesia , Cuba , Congo , Peru , Laos , Vietnam , Cambodia , Grenada , Libya , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Panama , Iraq , Somalia , - , Sudan , Jugoslavia , Afghanistan . You may be lonely , but it 's time to stop being afraid . To all the abandoned children on earth , let 's rise up together and fight together ! We 're throwing away the old rules , taken from a place far , far away ! Tonight , I send this message to all the adults who stole our freedom and pinned us down . Merry Christmas . Wild Seven and Nanahara Shuya . Evacuate ! You OK ? Look after the baby , the children ... Who fired the missile ? ! We 're still investigating ! Sir , a call for you . Who the hell is it ? It 's ... the Prime Minister . Put him through . Yes sir . Hey teacher , what a mess , huh ? Who do you think fired those missiles ? We finally pissed that country off ! I just got a call from their president . They 're going to attack in 12 hours . What the hell 's going on with your class ? ! What are you waiting for ? ! So what if a dozen kids die , it doesn 't matter ! Fire a missile and blow up the whole damned island ! You really mean that ? You surprise me . I thought you were a full-fledged adult who 'd cross the line a long time ago . You do understand , there are only two sides , the winners and losers . Which side are you on ? Fight with that country for justice and freedom ... Cut the crap , you murderer ! What ? Half a century ago , that country compared ours to a 12 year old . How old does that make that country now ? If any country pisses it off , it just bombs them . You call that adult behavior ? ! Listen , the whole world 's rallied by that country . And who made that choice ? ! So what the hell are you doing there ? I see . Too bad . I had hopes for you . Exercising my full power as Prime Minister , I call upon the armed forces . Prepare for battle immediately . Before that country launches its missiles I want every last terrorist and Nanahara Shuya , DEAD ! Attention ! Salute ! Taku ! Taku ... Takuma ? Kuze ... You OK ? I can 't really move . But we 've got to get back or Nao will worry . You 're hurt , save your strength . How ironic ... What ? I have waited too long with telling you Takuma ... I kind of like you ... I had to say it before I die . But ... but ... now ... Kuze ! Girl # 5 Kuze Haruka . DEAD . 9 To Go . A drink ? No thanks . It 's nearly dawn . Our battle with the adults is about to begin . In the 6 months we 've been here , we 've stumbled upon a mine shaft . It might lead back to the mainland . Take the children and escape . What about you ? We 'll stay here and draw the enemy in . This is no place for you . The real struggle lies ahead . Truly , living life is 100 times harder than dying . The Final Morning - 12 / 26 - 5 : 40AM Sakai at point B here Manned and ready . C point here . Preparations are OK . Shuya . Could you tell me my position ? . Position ? This is what you do . Take this Kalashnikov . This is a powerful gun . It 's used by freedom - fighters all over the world . But you decide who it shoots . Protect the others . Shuya ... I know you might get lost along the way , but whatever you do , never give up . Farewell . Sister ... I ... I 'll never forget you . What 's wrong ? You go , too . I 'm staying here . To see this through to the end . Closer ... Not yet ... Closer ... Not yet ... FIRE ! Kazama ! Taku , what 's wrong ? I ... I don 't understand things much and I don 't want to . But if I run away now ... I 'm turning my back on something important . You want to go back ... I can 't go back , I promised Shuya . I ... What am I supposed to do ? ! Decide for yourself . I 'm going . Kyoko-san ! I was always in love with you ! Go then . Yes ! Sorry , I always make you worry . I 'll see you again right ? Of course . I 'm just going to find an answer . You ! What are you idiots doing here ? ! We 're all in this together ! Hey ! Hey !

See this thing through ! Hurry ! We 're going ! Maki ! Haruya ... Hurry ! Yo ! So you 're Nanahara Shuya ? I 'm Takeuchi Riki . " We declare war against all adults . " Gotta hand it to you , you 've got guts . Every adult on earth wants you dead . From now on , you 'll have to live with all the lives you 've taken . Including my daughter , who died in your terrorist attack . Neither of us have anywhere to call home . Boy # 1 Aoi Takuma . Girls # 4 Kitano Shiori . One question : In real life is there only winning or the losing ? Is that really true ? Go . You 'll only find the answer by living your life . I ... always did want to play rugby with you guys ... Just go . Three ... Two ... One ... Go ! Hey look . There 's a light ! Let 's go ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Can I ask you something ? That girl in the painting , Nakagawa Noriko , what 's she like ?

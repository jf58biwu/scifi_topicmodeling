SO YOU JUST LEFT ? WE COULDN 'T AFFORD NOT TO . DANIEL HAS APVs PATROLLING THE BORDERLANDS EVERY SIX HOURS , AND WE WEREN 'T PREPARED TO HANDLE THAT MUCH FIREPOWER . IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REAL SIMPLE . YEAH . IT 'S FUNNY HOW IT NEVER REALLY WORKS OUT THAT WAY , ISN 'T IT ? NOW WE HAVE TO FIND THE TARGET BEFORE DANIEL 'S FORCES GET THERE FIRST . I DON 'T HAVE THE PEOPLEOR THE RESOURCES FOR A JOB THIS BIG , SO- - WHY IS HE SO IMPORTANT ? I CAN 'T TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW . LOOK , ALL I CANTELL YOU IS THAT HE 'S ANIMPORTANT PART OF DANIEL 'S OPERATION , ONE WE 'VE BEEN COURTINGFOR A LONG TIME NOW . HE DOESN 'T LIKEWHAT DANIEL 'S DOING ANY MORE THAN WE DO , BUT HE 'S AFRAID . WE GUARANTEED HIM PROTECTION . EVERYTHING WAS GOING FINE UNTIL HE DIDN 'T SHOW . THIS TARGET ... HE , UH , GOT A NAME ? YES . AND THAT WOULD BE ? I CAN 'T TELL YOU THAT . YOU KNOW , YOU COULD GO TO THE MOUNTAIN , SEE MARKUS BY YOURSELF . WE 'VE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT YOU . HE KNOWS THAT YOU 'RE A RESISTANCE LEADER IN ONE OF DANIEL 'SMAIN CITIES . DOES HE KNOW FOR SURE WHAT I LOOK LIKE ? YOU SHOW HIM A PICTURE ? NO . THEN I COULD BE ANYBODY . I LIVE INSIDEDANIEL 'S WORLD . I KNOW WHAT THEY 'RE CAPABLE OF , AND YOUR PEOPLESHOULDN 'T TRUSTANYONE OR ANYTHING . YEAH , BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU TRUST ME A LITTLE , OR YOU WOULDN 'T BE HERE .

WE NEED YOUBACK AT THE MOUNTAIN . I 'M KIND OFIN THE MIDDLE OF THINGSRIGHT NOW . WE 'RE FINISHING UP ON THE RELAY SYSTEMS THAT CONNECT ALL THE ALLIANCE TOWNS INTO ONE BIG COMMUNICATIONS NET . IS IT REALLY IMPORTANT ? YEAH , I THINK IT IS . YOU CAN 'T TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ? WE 'RE LOOKINGFOR A GUY , AND I THINKYOU CAN HELP . THAT 'S ALLI 'VE GOT RIGHT NOW . YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THIS ONE , DAD . WHAT 'S THE SCHEDULE ? I 'VE RADIOED AHEAD . MARKUS WILL SEND A CHOPPER TO PICK YOU UP IN THE MORNING AND BRING YOU TO THE MOUNTAIN . ALL RIGHT.I 'LL FINISH UPWHAT I CAN , AND I 'LL SEE YOUTOMORROW . OKAY , I 'LL SEE YOU THEN . ALL RIGHT , YOU CAN GO . THIS BETTER BEWORTH IT , RACHEL . WOULD A CHANCE TO BRING DOWN DANIEL ONCE AND FOR ALL BE WORTH IT , JEREMIAH ? AND HE CAN DO THIS ? WHO IS THIS GUY ? ALL GOOD THINGS TO THOSE WHO WAIT . MIND IF I ... NO , SURE.GO AHEAD . WHAT 'S THE BOOK ? IT 'S THE MEMOIRSOF ULYSSES S. GRANT . I 'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS BOOK FOR OVER A YEAR . I FINALLY FOUND IT IN AN OLD LIBRARY IN DENVER . I 'M A BIT OF A HISTORY BUFF . HE- - WAS THE 18th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . DIED IN 1885 , PENNILESS AND ABANDONED BY THE COUNTRY THAT HE SAVED DURING THE CIVIL WAR . THE ONLY WAY HE FIGURED HE COULD PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY WAS BY WRITING HIS MEMOIRS , BUT NOBODY WANTED HIS LIFE STORY . THE ONLY PERSON THAT WOULD PUBLISH IT WAS HIS OLD FRIEND MARK TWAIN , EVEN THOUGH IT PRETTY MUCH BANKRUPTED HIM . I 'M KIND OF A HISTORY BUFF MYSELF . I SEE . SO YOU 'VE READ THIS ? NO . I HEARD THERE WAS ONE LAST COPY IN DENVER , BUT SOMEBODY GOT THERE BEFORE I COULD . WELL , IT 'S A GREAT BOOK . IT 'S ACTUALLY THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN ON WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO GO TO WAR WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE . DO YOU THINK IT 'LL COME IN HANDY ? I HOPE NOT . I SURE HOPE NOT . YOU JUST GET HERE ? SIGNED UP LAST WEEK . STILL WORKING MY WAY THROUGH BASIC . I PROBABLY SHOULDN 'T EVEN BE TALKING TO YOU . OH , PLEASE . DON 'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT . I DON 'T STAND MUCH ON CEREMONY . I FIGURE , THE MORE INFORMATION YOU KNOW , THE BETTER YOUR CHANCESFOR SURVIVAL , SO ANY TIME YOU 'VE GOT A QUESTION , AND I 'M NOT BUSY , JUST ASK . ARE YOU BUSY NOW ? ( BEEP ) ( MARKUS ) : KURDY ? KURDY , CAN I SEE YOUFOR A MOMENT IN MY OFFICE ? SORRY , I 'VE GOT TO- - IT 'S OKAY . WHAT 'S YOUR NAME ? CRYSTAL . CRYSTAL . I 'M KURDY . I KNOW . SO WHAT 'S THE FOUR-ALARM FIRE ? WHOA , YOU 'RE A LONG WAYFROM HOME . CLOSE THE DOOR . I WANTED YOU TO HEAR THIS BEFORE WE TOLD THE OTHERS . WHY DON 'T YOU TELL THEMWHAT YOU TOLD ME ? WE 'RE LOOKING FOR A MANNAMED FREDERICK MONASH . HE 'S PART OF DANIEL 'S INNER CIRCLE . NOW , WE BELIEVE HE MAY HAVE INFORMATION THAT COULD BRING DOWN DANIEL 'S WHOLE OPERATION . HE 'S SOMEWHERE IN THE BORDERLANDS BETWEEN DANIEL 'S TERRITORY AND YOURS , BUT THAT 'S IT . WE HAVE TO FIND HIMBEFORE DANIEL 'S FORCESGET THEIR HANDS ON HIM . YOU GOT A PICTURE OF THIS GUY ? JUST ONE . IT WAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO , BUT IT 'S STILL ACCURATE . YOU STILL HAVEN 'T TOLD MEWHY YOU WANTED MY DAD HERE . I MEAN , DOES THIS GUY HAVE INFORMATION THAT HE CAN HELP US WITH , OR- - UNDERSTAND THAT FREDERICK IS ONE OF DANIEL 'S CORE GROUP , THAT HE 'S ONE OF THE PEOPLEDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLEFOR HIS ENTIRE OPERATION . THAT DOESN 'T EXPLAIN WHY YOU KEPT HIS NAME FROM ME ALL THE WAY HERE . I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT SAY THE WRONG THING TO SOMEBODY . SAY THE WRONG THING TO WHO ? ONE OF MY PEOPLE INSIDE DANIEL 'S ORGANIZATION SMUGGLED THIS OUT TO ME LAST YEAR . TOOK US A WHILETO FIGURE OUT WHO THE TWO GUYS IN THE PICTURE WERE . ONE IS THE TARGET . THE OTHER ... YOUR FATHER , JEREMIAH . HEY , JEREMIAH . WHAT 'S ALL THIS ABOUT ? IT 'S ABOUT YOU , DAD . EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND , I 'M FINDING OUT SOMETHING NEW ABOUT YOU . WHERE DID YOU GET THIS ? IT DOESN 'T MATTER WHERE I GOT IT . DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS ? THAT IS ONE OF DANIEL 'S CORE PEOPLE . HE 'S DEAD . THAT 'S WHAT I WAS LED TO BELIEVE . ALL RIGHT , YOU BROUGHT ME ALL THIS WAY . YOU WANT TO HEAR THE EXPLANATION OR NOT ? HOW MUCH LONGERARE YOU GOINGTO KEEP DOING THAT ? BATTERY KEEPS LOSING THE CHARGE . IF I KEEP TOPPING IT OFF , MAYBE IT 'LL HELP . YOU NEED TO REST . IF WE 'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF DANIEL 'S TERRITORY , WE 'VE GOT TO KEEP MOVING . IN A MINUTE , ALL RIGHT- - EXCUSE ME , COULD YOU HELP ME , PLEASE ? WHO THE HELL ARE ... YOU 'RE ... OLD , YES . I 'M PROBABLY OLDERTHAN ANY OF YOUHAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE , BUT , YOU ... YOU DON 'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID . I DON 'T ... THE VIRUS WAS A LONG TIME AGO . IT 'S JUST THAT I ... I HAVEN 'T EATEN FOR ALMOST TWO DAYS , AND I SMELLED YOUR FIRE . LOOK , I ... I CAN PAY YOU . I 'VE GOT SOME MONEY HERE . THOSE ARE DANIEL DOLLARS . YES , THEY 'RE D-BUCKS . I GOT THEM FROM INSIDE . YOU CAN USE THESE TO BUY ANYTHING YOU WANT INSIDE THE CITY . YOU CAN TAKE THEM . LOOK , I ... I JUST NEED SOMETHING TO EAT . YOU CAN SHARE WHAT WE HAVE , BUT WE WON 'T TAKE THOSE . THAT 'S THE SORT OF THING WE 'RE TRYING TO AVOID . WE WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH DANIEL OR ANY OF HIS PEOPLE . THEN YOU 'VE GOT NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ME . THANK YOU . OH , MY GOD . MY GOD . WHAT HAVE WE DONE ? I 'M SORRY . I 'M ... I 'M SORRY . I 'M SO SORRY . FREDERICK MONASH WAS A GOOD MAN . HE WAS ONE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED SCIENTISTS BROUGHT TO VALHALLA SECTOR DURING THE BIG DEATH . THE GOVERNMENTWANTED TO HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF SKILLS ON BOARD FOR WHEN THE TIME CAME TO REBUILD THE WORLD . I GUESS THEY NEVER IMAGINED THAT THE PEOPLEWHO SURVIVED , YOU , WOULD HAVE SOME OTHER IDEAS ABOUT HOW THAT WORLD SHOULD BE REBUILT . SO WHAT WAS HIS AREA OF EXPERTISE ? PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE . BRAINWASHING . SOCIAL PROGRAMMING . IF YOU WANTED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO DO WHAT YOU WANTED THEM TO DO , FREDERICK MONASHWAS YOUR MAN . HE IMAGINED THAT HIS ROLE WOULD BE TO HELP OUTLINE THE DYNAMICS OF A BETTER SOCIETY . WAS IT ? NO . LIKE MANY OF THE OTHERS , HE DIDN 'T REALIZE WHAT HE 'D SIGNED ON FOR WHEN HE AGREED TO GO , DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT VALHALLA SECTOR WOULD TURN INTO . HE FIGURED IT OUT FAST ENOUGH . THIS WASN 'T ABOUT THE SURVIVAL OF THE COUNTRY . THIS WAS ABOUT ESTABLISHING A POLICE STATE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE POWER ELITE . WE STARTEDMEETING IN SECRET , TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WHEN VALHALLA WAS READYTO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD . ISN 'T THERE SOME WAY WE CAN FIGHT THIS FROM INSIDE ? NO . WE 'VE CREATED THE IMPRESSION OF A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM IN HERE , BUT IT 'S THE SAME CREW , SAME AGENDAS , JUST DIFFERENT NAMES . SO MAYBE WE NEED TO CREATE A REAL OPPOSITION PARTY , A GROUP THAT CAN SPEAK OUT AGAINST WHAT 'S GOING ON . WE ALREADY KNOW THERE 'S A LOT AROUND HERE THAT- - BUT THEY WON 'TSPEAK OUT . THEY 'RE TOO AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES . THEY SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL . IT 'S JUST EASIER TO GO ALONG . WE 'LL NEVER CREATE AN OPPOSITION PARTY INSIDE VALHALLA . NO . NOT IN HERE . WHAT 'S ON YOUR MIND ? I 'M NOT SURE . LET ME THINK ABOUT ITFOR A WHILE . I KNEW HE 'D COME UPWITH SOMETHING , BUT HE KEPT IT TO HIMSELF . SO HE NEVER TOLD YOU WHAT IT WAS ? NO . NEVER . THEN WHAT 'S THE POINTOF ALL THIS ? WELL , IF FREDERICK IS STILL ALIVE , IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHATEVER HE WAS PLANNING . HE WAS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF US ALLOWED UP TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD . IT WAS HIS JOB TO COLLECT DATA ON THE VARIOUS GROUPSFORMING ABOVE GROUND , SO THAT WE COULD KEEP AN EYE ON POSSIBLE THREATS . IT WAS AFTER HE RETURNED FROM ONE SUCH TRIP THAT HE BEGAN TO PUT THINGS INTO MOTION . BECAUSE ACCESS TIMETO THE COMPUTERS WAS LIMITED , HE HAD ME HELPINGWITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATAHE WAS ACCUMULATING , WHILE OTHERS HANDLEDDIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT . THE LAST OF THEM . JUST PUT THEM DOWN THERE , PLEASE . PUT THOSE WITH THE OTHERS . BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAIDOF THE INFORMATIONGETTING OUT , EVERYONE INVOLVED HAD JUST THEIR PIECEOF THE PUZZLE . NOBODY BUT FREDERICK , AND MAYBE A COUPLE OF OTHERS , KNEW THE FULL STORY . ONCE I MANAGED TO CATCH A LOOKAT SOME OF THE OTHER PAPERS . THERE WERE PAPERSON PSYCHO-SOCIAL PROGRAMMING , GROUP DYNAMICS , THE BIRTH OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS , HISTORICAL PAPERSON STALIN , RUSSIA , NAZI GERMANY , CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP , BEHAVIORAL CONDITIONING , THE WHOLE GAMUTOF PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE . TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE CAN BE A DANGEROUS THING , DEVON . A VERY DANGEROUS THING . IT 'S BEST YOU FORGET ANYTHING YOU JUST SAW . DID YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE ? NOTHING . THE ONLY OTHER THING I KNEW ABOUT THE PROGRAM WAS ITS NAME , PROJECT BACKFIRE . BACKFIRE ? AS IN SOMETHING GOING WRONG ? MAYBE HE WAS HOPINGTO USE THIS STUFF TO TURN VALHALLA 'S PEOPLEAGAINST THE GUYS IN CHARGE . I DON 'T KNOW . I 'D HOPED TO FIND OUT MORE , BUT ONE DAY , SEVERAL OF HIS TEAM WERE ALLOWED TO GO WITH HIM ON AN EXPEDITION TOPSIDE . THEY DIDN 'T COME BACK . UP UNTIL NOW , I 'D JUST ASSUMED THAT THE MILITARYHAD FOUND OUTWHAT HE WAS UP TO , AND SIMPLYELIMINATED THE PROBLEM , BUT MAYBE THAT 'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED . SO IF HE 'S ALIVE , MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHERS WHO WENT WITH HIM ARE ALSO ALIVE . IT 'S POSSIBLE , BUT I CAN 'T SEEWHY HE OR ANY OF THE OTHERS WOULD END UP WORKING FOR DANIEL . SOMETHING HERE DOESN 'T ADD UP . MARKUS , SINCE I 'VE FINISHED HOOKING UP THE COMPUTERS BETWEEN HERE AND VALHALLA SECTOR , PERHAPS I SHOULD START SEARCHING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE RECORDS . MAYBE THERE 'S SOMETHING ABOUT FREDERICK IN THE BASE LOGS . MAYBE THERE 'S SOME OF HIS FILES THAT THEY DIDN 'T FIND . GOOD IDEA . I 'LL HAVE SOMEONE SET IT UP . IT 'LL TAKE US A WHILE TO HOOK IN . THANKS . YEAH . IF HE 'S GOING TO BE USING THE COMPUTER , I WANT SOMEONE TO MONITOR HIS ACTIVITIES . HEY , YOU 'RE KIND OF NEW IN TOWN TO BE GIVING ORDERS , DON 'T YOU THINK ? IF HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE , THERE 'S NOTHINGTO LOSE BY KEEPING AN EYE ON WHAT HE FINDS . UNLESS ... YOU 'D RATHER NOT . DO IT . YOU KNOW , IT 'S A HELL OF A WORLD . YOU FIGHT FOR 16 YEARS TO FIND YOUR FATHER , AND IN THE END , YOU DON 'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU CAN TRUST HIM . HELL OF A WORLD . OKAY , LISTEN UP , PEOPLE . YOUR TARGET IS FREDERICK MONASH , AGE 57 , LAST REPORTED IN THE BORDERLANDS WEST OF DANIEL 'S TERRITORY . WE 'RE PULLING YOU OFF REGULAR SURVEY DUTIES IN ORDER TO FIND HIM . WHEN YOU HIT THE BORDER , YOU 'LL SPLIT UP , BUT YOU 'LL REPORT TO JEREMIAH AND KURDY AS TEAM LEADERS , SINCE THEY 'VE HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN DANIEL 'S TERRITORY . SO GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER , PEOPLE . YOU 'RE LEAVING IN 30 MINUTES . EXCUSE ME , MARKUS ? YEAH . I ASSUMED I 'D BE GOING WITH JEREMIAH AND KURDY , BUT THEY SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE JUST THEM . YEAH , WE 'RE LIMITING EACH TEAM TO TWO MEMBERS SO WE CAN GET THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SCOUTS LOOKING FOR THE TARGET . SO WHO AM I GOING WITH ? NOBODY . YOU 'RE STAYING HERE . WHY ? BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE WE NEED YOU TO DO . COME ON . YOU 'RE STARING AGAIN . I KNOW . THEY TOLD ME I WAS SUPPOSED TO STAY HERE , IN CASE YOUNEEDED HELP . IN OTHER WORDS , KEEP AN EYE ON ME , IN CASE I CAN 'T BE TRUSTED . BOTH EYES , ACTUALLY . YOU KNOW , SOONER OR LATER , YOU 'D THINK FOLKS WOULD LEARN THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN BE TRUSTED , WOULDN 'T YOU ? YOU 'D THINK SO , WOULDN 'T YOU ? HOW DO THEY EXPECT US TO FIND THIS GUY ? THIS IS SEVERAL HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OUT HERE . IT 'S LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK . WELL , I GUESS WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK . SIT ON IT TILL SOMETHING STICKS US IN THE ASS . YOU KNOW , THAT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION . WELL , THAT WAS A RHETORICAL ANSWER . NO SUCH THING . THERE IS NOW . I THOUGHT I 'D SEE IF YOU WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT . ARE YOU HUNGRY ? STARVING . HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN OUT ? A DAY , MAYBE MORE . THERE 'S SOMEBODY CHASING YOU , ISN 'T THERE ? WHO ARE YOU , ANYWAY ? IT 'S BETTER YOU DON 'T KNOW . BETTER FOR ME , OR BETTER FOR YOU ? THAT 'S ANOTHER QUESTION I PROBABLY SHOULDN 'T ANSWER . WE HAVE TO GO NOW . WE TRY NOT TO STAY IN ONE PLACE TOO LONG . LESS CHANCE OF TROUBLE THAT WAY . WE WOULDN 'T HAVE STAYED HERE THIS LONG , EXCEPT- - YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT ME . I 'M SORRY ... AND THANK YOU . WE CAN LEAVE YOU A FEW THINGS , IF THERE 'S ANYTHINGYOU NEED . THE BIKE , AND THE BATTERY , AND THOSE BITS OF ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT THERE . CAN 'T DO IT . WE 'VE BEEN ABLETO HOOK UP THE BIKETO THE GENERATOR , AND WE BUILT UP A SMALL CHARGE IN THE BATTERY . FIGURE WE CAN SELL IT IN THE NEXT TOWN , GET ENOUGH SUPPLIES TO KEEP US GOING FOR A WHILE . WE THINK WE CANGET A LOT FOR A CHARGED BATTERY . YES , YES , YOU CAN , BUT YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE FOR THIS . USED TO BE , IT COST AS MUCH AS A CAR , A BIG CAR , BUT NOW ... YOU 'RE SURE YOU WANT TO LET THIS GO ? THAT 'S FROM ANOTHER WORLD . I DON 'T WANT IT ANYMORE . I 'LL GIVE YOU THAT FOR THOSE . OKAY . WHAT 'RE YOU GOING TO DOWITH A BATTERY ALL THE WAY OUT HERE , WITH NOTHING TO USE IT ON ? IT 'S BETTER YOU- - NOT TO KNOW.EXACTLY. OKAY ... YOU HAD THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD 'S TECHNOLOGY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS , FREDDIE . NOW LOOKWHAT YOU 'RE REDUCED TO . AFTERNOON , GENTLEMEN . I 'M LOOKING FOR A MAN . I WONDER IF YOU 'VE SEEN HIM . ANYTHING YET ? NO , NO . NOT QUITE . WHAT 'S THE PROBLEM ? ALL THE COMMAND LEVEL FILES AT VALHALLA SECTOR WERE ENCODED . NOW , I GOT MY HANDS ON ALL THE SECURE CODES WHEN WE TOOK OVER THE BASE , BUT EVERY TIME I FIND A FILE ABOUT FREDERICK 'S WORK , I HAVE TO MANUALLY DECODE IT ALL AGAIN . I MEAN , LOOK AT THEM . IT COULD TAKE DAYS TO GO THROUGH THEM ALL . WELL ... HAVE YOU DECODED THAT ONE ? YES . THAT ONE ? UH-HUH . THAT ONE ? NO , THAT 'S A MAINTENANCE AND SUPPLY SUBDIRECTORY . THEY WOULDN 'T HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION ON A DIRECTORY LIKE THAT . MAYBE ... OR IT COULD BE A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY GOES THERE LOOKING FOR IT . YEAH , BUT WHY THAT ONE ? I MEAN , THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DIRECTORIES LIKE THAT . TRUST ME . I 'M VERY GOODAT THESE THINGS . THAT 'S ODD . IT 'S GOT A SECURITY LEVEL FIVE . SOMETHING THIS SIMPLE SHOULD HAVE A SECURITY LEVEL TWO AT BEST . HMM . YOU ARE GOOD AT THESE THINGS . I HAVE CONNECTIONS . WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS STUFF UP TO MARKUS , ASAP . I JUST HOPE THE RIGHT PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE LISTENING . ( TAPPING OUT " S-O-S " IN MORSE CODE ) AFTER FREDERICK DISAPPEARED , HIS RESEARCH WAS CONFISCATED . HE HAD BEEN WORKING ON WAYS TO STOP VALHALLA SECTOR BY CREATING A BACKFIRE , IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD SET A SMALL FIRE TO STOP A MUCH LARGER ONE . HE HAD DEVELOPED A WAY TO FAST-TRACK THE CREATION OF A COUNTER-FORCE OUTSIDE , USING THE SAME DEMOCRATIC IDEALS AND PRINCIPLES THAT WERE ABANDONEDBY VALHALLA SECTOR . THE WHOLE PROJECT HINGED ON FINDING THE RIGHT CHARISMATIC LEADER . ONCE YOU HAD THAT PERSON , THE PROGRAM SET OUT HOW YOU COULDMANIPULATE A POPULATION USING THE TOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT OF YOUR OWN DESIGN . THIS FEELS PRETTY LIGHT FOR SOMETHING THAT AMBITIOUS . WHERE 'S THE REST OF IT ? I DON 'T THINK HE EVER COMMITTED IT TO PAPER . IF I 'M RIGHT , THEN FREDERICK IS CARRYING THE BLUEPRINTS TO DANIEL 'S ENTIRE OPERATION INSIDE HIS HEAD . STILL NOTHING . MOVING ONTO SECTOR THREE . ALL RIGHT . SURVEY TWO , WHAT DO YOU GOT ? COPY THAT . WE 'RE MOVING ONTO SECTOR TWO ... ( STATIC ) COME BACK , SURVEY TWO . I DIDN 'T COPY . RADIO 'S A PIECE OF JUNK . WAIT A MINUTE . LET ME SEE THAT . JEREMIAH ? SURVEY TWO.CLEAR THE CHANNEL , EVERYBODY ELSESTAND BY FOR A SEC . ( " S-O-S " TAPPED IN MORSE CODE ) THAT 'S MORSE CODE . YOU SURE ? YEAH . I READ ABOUT IT . THAT 'S THE BIG ONE . THAT 'S THE ONE EVERY BOOK TELLS YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR . THREE SHORT , THREE LONG , THREE SHORT . S-O-S . FREDERICK ? IF YOU WERE A SCIENTISTFROM THE OLD WORLD , WHAT WOULD YOU USE ? SURVEY TWO , YOU CATCHING THAT STATIC ? NEGATIVE . ALL QUIET . SURVEY ONE , HOW ABOUT YOU ? YEAH , I GOT ITLOUD AND CLEAR . I WAS WONDERINGWHAT IT WAS . OKAY , HERE WE ARE . SURVEY ONE , WHO CANHEAR THE SIGNAL , IS RIGHT HERE . MAYBE WE CAN FORM A CIRCLE AROUND THIS GUY , PUSH OUR WAY IN , PICK UP ON THE SIGNAL ... IF WE TO DO IT , WE BETTER DO IT FAST . NO TELLING HOW LONG HE 'S GOING TO BE ABLETO KEEP THAT SIGNAL UP . ALL RIGHT . SURVEY TEAMS , LISTEN UP . WE 'VE GOT A LEAD . COME ON . JUST A BIT MORE . THIS HAS GOT TO GET HEARD . AFTERNOON . YOU KNOW WHO I AM . THESE GENTLEMEN , MY ASSOCIATES , THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE WORTH A MOMENT OF MY TIME TO TALK TO YOU . WE 'RE IN SEARCH OF A MAN , AN OLD MAN , OLDER THAN ANYONE ELSE YOU 'RE LIKELY TO HAVE SEEN LATELY . WE HAVEN 'T SEEN ANYONE . WE 'RE JUST- - YOU 'RE DRIFTERS , PARASITES LIVING OFF THE WORKS OF OTHERS . YOU ARE A DARKNESS IN THE EYES OF DANIEL , AND ENTITLED TO NOTHING ... EXCEPT THE POSSIBILITY OF MERCY , BUT MERCY COMES ONLY IN RESPONSETO TRUE REPENTANCE . HAVE YOU SEEN THE MAN WE ARE PURSUING ? NO . WE 'VE SEEN NO ONE . INTERESTING . YOU SEE , MY MEN ARE TRAINED TO SEARCH THE BELONGINGS OF ANYONE THEY FIND . SO PERHAPS YOU MIGHT EXPLAIN WHAT THIS WAS DOING IN ONE OF YOUR BAGS . BETWEEN YOU AND A BLADE ... THERE ARE YOUR TWO ROADS . ONE IS THE TRUTH , THE OTHER 'S A LIE . WHICH ROAD DO YOU WANT TO WALK DOWN ? ( HONKS ) HEY ! OVER HERE ! OVER HERE ! STOP ! OVER HERE ! HEY . WE GOT YOU . CLIMB ON IN . OH , THANK YOU . WE 'VE GOT COMPANY . LET 'S GO . WHERE THE ROAD LEVELS OUT , WE TAKE THEM . I CAN 'T SHAKE HIM . I KNOW . THERE 'S NOT EVEN A HOLEWE CAN DUCK OUT IN . I KNOW . ALL RIGHT , SURVEY TEAMS , LISTEN UP . WE 'VE GOT THE TARGET . WE 'VE ALSO GOT PROBLEMS . I THINK THERE MAY BE A WAY OUT OF THIS , BUT THERE 'S ONLY ONE SHOT , SO LISTEN UP . ALL RIGHT , STAND BY . WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY ? WHICH ONE DO WE GO AFTER ? I MEAN , WE CAN 'T GO AFTER ALL OF THEM . WE DON 'T HAVE ENOUGH CARS , AND THERE 'S NO WAY OF TELLING WHICH ONE HAS FREDERICK . SIR ? I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU WENT THROUGH TO GET HERE , FREDERICK . NOW , IF YOU 'RE TIRED , WE CAN WAIT UNTIL YOU 'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REST . NO , NO . THAT 'S ALL RIGHT . YOU DID ALL THIS FOR ME . THE LEAST I CAN DO IS TELL YOU THE TRUTH . WHAT I KNOW IS KNOWN ONLY BYA HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IN THE INNER CIRCLE , MOST OF WHOM ARE PART OF THE TEAM THAT LEFT VALHALLA SECTOR WITH ME FIVE YEARS AGO . THIS INFORMATIONIS SO SENSITIVE THAT ANYONE DISCOVERING OR HEARING WHAT YOU 'RE ABOUT TO HEAR IS INSTANTLY MARKED FOR DEATH . GO ON . IN TRYING TO FIGHT DANIEL , YOU 'RE FIGHTING A SHADOW , BECAUSE THERE IS NO DANIEL . WE CREATED A FALSE PERSONALITY , SO PERFECT IT COULDN 'T EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD , GAVE HIM A HISTORYDESIGNED TO INSPIRE PEOPLE , AND A WILL TO USE FORCE WHEN IT SERVED THE INTERESTS OF THOSE IN CHARGE . NOW , WAIT A MINUTE . WE 'VE SEEN THIS GUY . YOU SAW A FACE , AN IMAGE , A VOICE , CAREFULLY ENGINEERED FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT . RED HAIR FOR STRENGTH , LEAN AND SERIOUS . WE TOOK THE EYESFROM ONE PRESIDENT , THE MOUTH FROM ANOTHER , CREATED A COMPOSITE IMAGE THAT PEOPLE WOULD INSTINCTIVELY WANT TO TRUST . WE TOOK OUR LESSONS IN IMAGES , MUSIC , AND ARCHITECTURE FROM THE SECOND WORLD WAR , FROM THE SOVIET UNION , FROM KOREA , FROM CULTS , FROM CHARISMATIC LEADERS . I THOUGHT IT COULD BE CONTROLLED . I MEAN , I THOUGHTHE COULD BE CONTROLLED , BUT DANIEL TOOK ON A LIFE OF HIS OWN , AND THAT LIFE WAS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE MEN HO CREATED HIM ... AND THAT 'S WHERE WE FAILED . THE PEOPLE OUTSIDEWERE SO NAIVE , AND EASILY TAKENADVANTAGE OF , BECAUSE THEY WANTEDTO BELIEVE . THE OTHERS WHO ESCAPEDVALHALLA SECTOR WITH ME BEGAN TO FALL PREY TO THE POWERTHEY WERE ACCUMULATING . THEY DIDN 'T WANT TO CREATEA BETTER WORLD . THEY BROUGHTTHE OLD WORLD WITH THEM . WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS HERE , FREDERICK . THE RESEARCH , YOUR CONTACTS HERE . IT HAS GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD SOMETHING IMPORTANT , BUT WE DON 'T FEEL YOUR WORK GOES FAR ENOUGH . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND ... LOOK , FREDERICK , WE HAVE TO PULL A SOCIETY TOGETHER OUT OF CHAOS . AND THAT REQUIRES ORDER . YOU CAN 'T BANK ON GOOD FEELINGS AND PROMISES TO MAKE PEOPLE DO WHAT YOU TELL THEM TO DO . THEY 'RE GOING TO NEED POSITIVE RESULTS , AND THOSE KIND OF RESULTS ONLY COMEFROM PROPER APPLICATION OF THE IRON FIST IN THE VELVET GLOVE . THAT IS NOTWHAT WE DISCUSSED . WE SAID WE WOULD LEAD BY EXAMPLE . AND SO WE ARE . WE JUST DON 'T FEEL YOUR EXAMPLE GOES NEARLY FAR ENOUGH . WHAT BEGAN AS AN EXPERIMENTTO CREATE A FORCE FOR GOOD , A GUIDING LIGHT , WAS CORRUPTED , TWISTED INTO SOMETHING DARK AND MONSTROUS . IF EVERYBODY ON THE EAST COAST FINDS OUT THERE IS NO DANIEL , THAT EVERYTHING THEY 'VE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE IS A LIE , THAT THEY 'VE BEENALL USED AND MANIPULATED ... THEN EVERYTHINGWOULD FALL APARTAT THE SEAMS . ONE PROBLEM . ALL WE HAVE IS YOUR WORD FOR THIS . THERE 'S NO HARD PROOF OF ANYTHING YOU 'VE JUST TOLD US . WE COULD STILLGET THE WORD OUT THERE . NO . IF WE DO , THEY 'LL JUST DENY IT , AND IF WE CAN 'T BACK IT UP , THEN NOBODY WILL BELIEVE US WHEN WE COME BACK A SECOND TIME . BUT THE PROOF YOU REQUIRE DOES EXIST . THE REPORTS , THE FILES , THE ROUGH DRAFTS , THE ELEMENTS OF DANIEL 'S FACE AND PERSONALITY ... ALL THIS AND MORE IN A SMALL , DARK ROOM , IN THE HANDS OF THE MENTHAT CREATED HIM . ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO IN AND GET THEM ... BEFORE THEY GET YOU . I 'VE JUST HEARD FROM OUR PEOPLE IN THE FIELD . FREDERICK HAS APPARENTLY REACHED SAFE HAVEN IN THE WESTERN ALLIANCE . IF THE TRUTH GETS OUT- - I KNOW . WE 'D PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO HOLD OFF ON A DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH OUR OPPOSITE NUMBERS IN THUNDER MOUNTAIN . I THINK YOU 'LL AGREE THAT TIME IS NO LONGER A LUXURY WE CAN AFFORD . AS OF NOW , TIME IS OUR ENEMY , AND SO ARE THEY . WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THEM DIRECTLY . WE HAVE TO BRINGEVERY FORCE WE HAVE TO BEAR ON THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATING THE OPPOSITION , BEFORE THEY CAN DO THE SAME TO US . WHAT BEGAN AS A GRAND EXPERIMENT HAS BECOME A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE . OUR LIVES , THEIR DEATHS .

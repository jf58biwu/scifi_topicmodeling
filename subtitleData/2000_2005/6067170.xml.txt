 My dearest Sophie ... Even as I write these words , feeling my pen press against paper ... I struggle to make sense of the world where I am now prisoner ... a world that looks and feels like our own ... but was created not by God , but by man . A world whose reality was written in bytes and bits ... Defense Department software running on a computer ... to which my consciousness has been chained . My friend Pinocchio reminds me this is just a game ... a digital reality where all that matters is survival . But there is more here , Sophie . A woman named Florence saved my life with the power to heal . Who gave her this power ? Some programmer ? For what purpose ? Or could it be , even in the unreality of this strange world ... there exists a higher power ... one whose call only Florence can hear ? Florence ! Hobbes ! Take a hand . - Do you see her ? - No . What the hell got into her ? I don 't know . - Has she ever just run off like this before ? - Something 's up . Florence had run to answer a threat . Whatever gave her the power to heal gave her other powers as well ... the ability to sense dangers Pinocchio and I could not even suspect . I 've become used to running here , Sophie , used to living in fear ... never stopping to think there might be a higher purpose behind all this ... a purpose no programmer could have imagined . My friend Florence was on a mission of mercy ... relying on her faith in a higher power . We did not know it yet ... but so were we . Hobbes ! Stop ! Don 't move ! - What ? - Stand still ! - Minefield . - Are you sure ? Oh , yeah . I 'm sure . Retrace your steps , Hobbes . Pinocchio , if we follow Florence 's tracks ... - Son of a ... - What ? Just get the hell away . Hey ! Stand clear ! Ripped By mstoll - Don 't move . - Oh , you think ? Give me your knife . What did you hear ? A click . - Just one click ? - One click . It 's your lucky day . It 's an antipersonnel mine . Pressure release trigger . I 'm gonna try to defuse it . Put the knife between your boot ... and the pressure plate . Go ! A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world ... your family and friends ... and though you may not know it ... I was sent to save you . It 's just a game . God does not reserve his gifts for any one soul . Florence 's miraculous ability to heal was shared by others ... women who , unlike her , lived in isolation ... women whom Florence , sensing danger , had gone to find . For here , just as in the real world ... the darkness preys on the light ... on the innocent , the holy . So Florence ran ... praying she was not too late . Are you one of them ? Don 't shoot ! Don 't-don 't-don 't ... Don 't shoot . I 'm just a man , just a little man ... trying to provide for his kith and kin . You like to give me a heart attack . L - I thought you were ... you know , one of them . Kind of short on conversation ... like them too . You wouldn 't happen to know where ... they went . Sisters . Sisters ? Healers . Bunch of women got the healing touch . See , my little boy ... my little son ... he 's gut sick . In a world of pain . Terrible , terrible pain . You 're the answer to our prayers . Can you heal our little boy ? Poor thing ... he 's green with pain . We want to thank you very kindly . Survival is the most basic of instincts . By all rights , Pinocchio and I should have died in that minefield . But the women Florence had run to save were closer than she knew . As I lay in that field , feeling life slip away from me ... I became aware of a presence ... a presence to whom I owe my survival ... and to whom Pinocchio would come to owe something far greater . Pinocchio . Florence ? Florence . Who are you ? Where am I ? How 'd I get here ? Hobbes . Where 's Hobbes ? Is he dead ? What are you doing ? Oh , God . Sorry , Sister . It 's my leg , isn 't it ? How bad is it ? Let me see . Where 's my leg ? Where 's my friggin ' leg ? - Hello , Sister . - I told you . What 'd I tell you ? She 's yours , for my cut of the profits , of course . I said the lot of them . She could lead you to ' em ... to where them other healers went . What makes you think she knows ? I ... I know who can make her talk . You being funny ? I know someone . You 'll see . Better happen fast ... before Santiago finds them . Leave me alone ! You people shouldn 't have saved me . You should have let me die . You think you 're doing me some big favor . How long you think ... a one-legged guy is gonna survive in this godforsaken hellhole ? This is all just too friggin ' rich . I said leave me alone ! Harsh Realm is a faithless world ... one where God is not believed to exist . And yet how else to explain my survival ? The faith that sustained Florence and the other healers was a threat ... a silent challenge to those who preached faithlessness . So they were to be hunted down , destroyed ... by those who built their empire on fear . Kilo 6 , this is Kilo Base . Report status . Report status . Kilo 6 to Kilo Base . I 'm solo on the edge of a field in grid 4-4-8-9 . No sign of target . Kilo Base to Kilo 6 . Kilo Base to Kilo 6 . Stay put . Your unit 's on the way . Roger that . Hold position , wait for my unit . Kilo 6 out . Don 't move ! The next shot 's a kill shot . Kilo Base to Kilo 6 . Hold up ! Lie still . Move , and we die . You 're lying on a mine . That was the trigger we just heard . It 's a pressure release . One wrong move , it 's gonna go . - You die too . - I 'm not offering it as a choice . Kilo Base to Kilo 6 . Kilo Base to Kilo 6 . Confirm location . Come in , Kilo 6 . - Over . - What are you doing out here ? - I heard you reference a target . - Kiss my ass . - Kiss it good-bye . - My unit 's on its way . - Hell , they 're never gonna find you out here . - They 'll find me . They 'll find the jeep running or hear the radio . This whole area 's gonna be crawling with Republican Guard ... in just a short matter of time . - I got friends who are gonna find me first . - Oh , yeah ? Where are they ? Are you comin ' or goin ' , honey ? Right . Whatever . I know I 'm fascinating ' . Stare at the freak all you want . I don 't wanna be no cripple . I don 't wanna be no gimp . You want to help me , grow me a new leg . You can 't do that , can you , healer ? Can you ? You 're scared , aren 't you ? The radio 's dead . Car is dead . - Screw you . - You 're gonna die out here , soldier . For what ? Santiago ? Sure as hell not for you . Brave man , aren 't you ? Out there killing innocent people in the Realm . Vermin like you , and this phony Sisterhood . - Who ? - Group of women . Healers . Claim there 's some higher power . It 's a fact . I 've seen it . There is no higher power than Santiago . You 're so wrong . Yeah ? Prove me wrong . Let go of my wrist . Let go , and I 'll prove you wrong . Not a chance . Got someone wants to see you . Bring him here to me . You can get her to talk ? We need the location of a group of Sisters , healers . On the lam . She knows . She 's one of them , but an outcast ... come to warn them . But she knows ... where ... where they are , where we can find them . Yes . - That ain 't no answer . - Well , let me just talk to him . Excuse me . Excuse me . There 's been some kind of misunderstanding ' , see ? What we ... Um ... Um ... Yeah , he needs payment . - What are you doing ? - Let me go ! No . No . No ! Let him go ! Let him go ! - Put me down ! - No . You can 't take him ! He 's not a slave ! He 's just a kid . You 'll have another . They 'll feed him . Yeah . At least they 'll feed him . You 're shaking . You 're gonna get us both killed . I 'm cold . I can save your life ... prove there 's a higher power . A-All I want ... i-is to get off this thing in one piece . Okay . All right . You gotta let go of my wrist . Lesson number one . Grace . Hey . Hey ! This is mercy . Now we 're gonna learn about ... prayer . You people don 't understand . I can 't live like this . It 's what a soldier fears most ... what he can 't see . Apiece of metal buried in the ground . Boom . You 're not a soldier anymore . You 're half a man . People look you in the eye ... Your good eye ... and say it don 't matter . Spirit matters . That 's a lie . You may do okay if you can believe it ... but no , not me . God ! My third day in Yugoslavia ... It was military action , not even the war . They said the mine had been planted by rebels , guys we were fighting for . Took my leg at the knee ... half of my face . You believe that ? Not even a good story . I volunteered for Harsh Realm . Be a real hero . Both legs back . Maybe this is God 's way of ... punishing me ... for thinking I rated a second chance . You have no idea what I 'm talkin ' about , do you ? Don 't matter . It 'll all be over soon . All right . Nice and slow . Easy ! Easy . All right . I need a rock . A good size one . This is called faith ... that you don 't run off on me . - Trust is another thing . - You 're full of B.S. The only way we make it out of this field is together . Now give me the rock . Now , right here , on top of the knife . What is this a lesson in ? Humility . We 're gonna go that way , one step at a time . Lead the way . Where 's the clip ? Just one bullet . That 's all I ask . Damn it ! Where 's my ammo ? " Manus Domini . ' " The hand of God ? Manus Domini . You believe this crap ? You think God gave you these powers ? There 's no God here . It 's a freaking computer game . Some guy made you , writing computer code . Yours is the hand of man . Who 'd give you the power to heal , but not to speak ? God ? This is some man 's perverse fantasy ... that you went and made a religion out of . It 's all makin ' sense to me now . Why you banished Florence . You think you 're special ... but she knew you weren 't . She knew you 'd have to take up arms ... to fight ... to survive ... to outlast Santiago . He 'll tolerate no greater power ... no religion , no threat to his rule . My advice to you ... run . Keep running ... 'cause Santiago will find you . And when he does ... you 're all gonna die . What are you doing ? Stay there with your hands on your knees . I 'm taking away any chance you wouldn 't return me the favor of saving your life . I just spent the last four hours on my hands and knees ... making sure that you didn 't get killed . - There 's a big difference where I come from . - Oh , yeah ? Where I come from , we shoot first and talk about it after . Glad to see I 've had an impact . My unit comes out here and finds me like this ... you 're gonna wish you had shot me . Tell ' em you had orders from a higher power . You think you proved something ? All you proved to me is why we 're winning out here . Hey ! They 're lost , goin ' the wrong way . Smile , Sister . You 're goin ' home . I could 've killed you three times already , and I 'd kill you now ... but there 's no profit in it . Santiago pays when you and your Sisters are delivered alive . You lookin ' for ' em too ? Don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . I 'm just a man . Just a little man tryin ' to provide for my kith and kin . - Lookin ' for who ? - You about made me have a heart attack . - Who you lookin ' for ? - Uh , Sisters . Healers , they say . Uh , I got my wife around back . Gut sick . Terrible , terrible pain . Just over here . M-Maybe you can just have a look-see . I 'm afraid I can 't help her . You know , maybe she just needs to see a kind face . Gotta find these Sisters . He knows where they are . They took my boy . Ah , see , she 's delirious . They took my son ! He knows ! Sold my son into slavery . Any time . Finish the job . Come on ! Damn it ! Come on ! Come on ! What are you putting me through ? Why are you doing this to me ? Yes , sir ! I 'm gonna help you . Faith cannot be meek . Faith must be strong . What Pinocchio now knew was the truth ... that had made Florence an outcast from her Sisterhood ... That the innocent must not only be cherished . They must be defended . Take it easy , huh ? One false move , you 'll end up like me . What ? Guess you are special . He made me do it . See , he pulled a gun on me , and I like to have a heart attack when ... Quiet . Florence , stand up . This is a lesson in humility . My orders are to search and destroy . No mercy . I still expect to be paid by the head . What about my cut ? He took my boy , my pride and joy . You 'll get what you got comin ' to you . Just make sure there are no survivors . - Untie us ! - I was just thinkin ' that . Careful . The ability to heal is a gift ... but bestowing that gift takes from the healer , weakens her . It is self-sacrifice motivated by love ... even for one 's enemy . Perhaps Florence and her Sisters are merely virtual characters ... but if that 's true , then what of their love ? Is it any less real than our own ? I 'm dying . You 're not gonna die , soldier . What is it ? The events of these past days have changed little in Harsh Realm . The Sisters are still on the run from Santiago , as are we . And yet , everything here seems different to me now , Sophie . I now look at this strange world through the eyes of a believer ... knowing that where there is darkness , there is light ... where there 's fear , there 's hope . That our cause is worth fighting for ... and worth winning . I 'm taking the boy home . There are other boys . You 're Tom Hobbes . How do you know my name ? The healer believes you 're the one . She 's wrong . I made this ! Ripped By mstoll

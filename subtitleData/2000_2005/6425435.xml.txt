 Outstanding . Believe it or not , I 'm actually getting better at controlling this thing . How 'd you say you figured this out ? Well , much trial and error , actually . Yeah , it 's impressive . Well , I haven 't had much else to do . Takes time to learn to fly . I know you 've been practicing on the ground ... No ... what ... hang on ! How many times ? One . Once . Uno . You had to touch something ! D 'Argo , I didn 't touch anything . - How many times did I ask you ? ! I said , " Do not go inside the ship ! " - I needed the presnot calibrator . I was using it ! - Quit acting like Yosemite Sam ! I asked you just to stop ! - It came out of my module . Whoa , hey ! Yo , yo , yo , easy , man ! Remember what the doctors say about hyper-rage ... John , I have nothing . Nothing ! I have no wife , no son , no home , nothing ! I have been forced to manufacture ... - D 'Argo ... distractions in order to live ! - D 'Argo , your ship ... That ship is all I have ! - Look ... No ! It 's your ship ... - You sabotaged my frelling ship ! My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . Pilot ? Pilot ? I 'm sorry , Jool . As you can understand , I am ... Yeah , yeah , he 's not good . There 's some blood in his skull and some swelling and he 's barely breathing . Did the power cell in Zhaan 's diagnostic scanner activate ? Anything on its own power source still works . Then energy pulse seared all Moya 's active power conduits . We 're fortunate Comms weren 't in use at the time . Is that krastic ship still frelling with us ? Yes . D 'Argo feels Crichton 's interference must have triggered a security self-destruct sequence . Can he stop it ? When we last spoke , D 'Argo was rather agitated . Which part of " I don 't know " has you baffled ? Can 't flush the ship out . The hangar doors won 't open . Can 't escape in a Transport Pod . The hangar doors won 't open ! - Fix the hangar doors . Pilot has no control . You really frelled us this time , didn 't you ? Me ? It wasn 't me ! It was Crichton ! Oh , so you tried to kill him ? - I didn 't try and kill him , he slipped . You 're pathetic , you really are . And we 're all gonna die because of it . Ka D 'Argo ! Your Qualta Blade . That was mature . So when 's his ship gonna blow ? - Unknown . Moya and I have no active sensors in the Transport Hanger . Yeah , yeah , we get the idea . What ... what do we do ? Reactivate the DRDs . They 're the only ones who can rewire Moya . - Rewire ? Your ship crippled every inton of conduit and power application running at the time . Then I 'll cripple it . Hey , Princess ? We 're going to die , aren 't we ? Eventually . You got the mivonks to push the date back ? Help D 'Argo in the Transport Hangar . When he 's sick of you , find me . You know what 's happening ? Yeah . I 'm dying . Let 's see what 's left in the fuel tank . Go away and let me do what I gotta do . Oh what , find a reason to live ? I got plenty of reasons . Then give me ... the Letterman list . Earth , Dad , pizza , sex , cold beer , fast cars , sex , Aeryn . Love . Well , we 're both dead . Screw you . None of that crap will get the job done , John . You die , you drag me with you . You want some advice ? No . - Revenge . Revenge ? - Yes . Love is transient . Vaporous . And guess who Aeryn loves right now ? He wins , you lose . Thank you for coming , go away . Revenge is the strongest emotion , John . Go away . - D 'Argo put you here . Live to even the score . - Goodbye , Scorpy . Bye-bye . Your mind is no longer strong enough to control my comings and goings . Is that a challenge ? How did you ... Ohhh , dear ! Looney Tunes . Wasted energy , John . Now focus . Revenge is deep within your psyche . A core vestige from your earliest evolution . Unleash it now . No . This after school special dissipates our chances of survival , John . You really want revenge ? Oh , yes . Okay . Revenge . But only for you . Are you sure that noise means we 're going to explode ? What if it 's just a ... Soft core overload . It 's like it wants us to shut it down , but I don 't know how . But you did it before . Whatever Crichton did , he disabled the sequence of commands I was building up . I mean , what if it wasn 't Crichton ? What if something 's just happened ? I 've been off the ground on this thing four times . No problems . He did it . So dude , how you doin ' ? You 're dying . Yeah , yeah , D 'Argo tried to kill me . Perhaps an overstatement . Well , same net result . Is he an enemy you wish to harm ? Oh man , I don 't even know why we 're fighting . Then rise above his behavior . Moya and I find it advantageous to avoid confrontation by egressing . Run away ? Aggression feeds on opportunity . Remove yourself as a target and the pursuer will eventually tire . You 're very wise . I don 't get out much , so I read . Well thanks for the advice . You could try it now if you like . Um ... Oh , give me a break . Come on , D 'Argo . We 're friends . No more , human . You can run as much as you like , but I 'm gonna catch ya . Yee-haw ! D 'oh ! Yikes ! Come on , man , chill , before somebody gets hurt . Any guesses who , runt ? Better look out . Right . Like I am gonna fall for that . God , I love science fiction . Beep , beep . Hmm . Ah ! This is Farscape One , I am free and flying . Oh-ho ! Wormhole ! Yo , Harvey ! Front and center , dude . Whoa ! Oh . Pilot was right , you were wrong . Pilot was right , you were wrong . If I keep running , nothing can hu ... Nothing can hurt you ? Is that what you 're trying to say ? You can only run for so long , John . Even in the childlike safety of your cartoon . My way will sustain you . Mother 's milk . Brutal ... real ... revenge . John ! Take revenge , John ! Chiana 's efforts with the DRDs have restored minimal functioning . We now have a presence in the Maintenance Bay and our analysis of that ship 's energy signature indicates it will explode in just under an arn . Under an arn ? An estimate only . Can you do something ? We will not be able to expel that ship . So we 're all going to die ? Moya and myself certainly . However , I may have a way to save you . Take food , liquids and a long-range frequency modulator to Tier Sixteen 's Treblin side pressure hatchway . You should be able to survive a few solar days prior to hypothermia , if I jettison it . Oh , Pilot ... Go . We can 't just leave you . Go ! Gotcha , Princess . Treblin side hatch , Tier Sixteen . I 'm gonna try something then I 'll meet you in the cold storage . We 're not leaving without Crichton . But Pilot said ... An arn ! Load the supplies , do what I tell you . Children . Nothing works . I 've failed . Move , D 'Argo . Let Mommy shoot it . No , no , no , no , no . It won 't let you . Well let 's get out of here . I don 't like to lose . Well then why 'd you let go of me ? What 'd you say ? Just something Luxan . My grandfather used to say it all the time . Hey ! What are you doing ? I 'm not quite sure but I think that is a Luxan symbol for " spoken word . " You can read that ? A little bit . I 'm not really up on my ancient Luxan . What ? What 's it saying ? What ? ! I don 't know ! Well , is it Luxan ? - Yes . Well then how can you not know ? I 'm not ancient Luxan . I do not speak ancient Luxan and I do not read ancient Luxan , because I am not ancient Luxan . And not likely to become one , either . Moya 's dead-language library is incomplete . - What about ancient war declarations ? My access to it at this time even more so . - Historical fragments ? Even the ... transcription of speeches ? You can even try some ... At best , I am finding only words . - anti-Luxan propaganda . Fragments of words . Pilot , that ship is trying to kill us . I need to know why it speaks Luxan . The DRDs can prepare a supplemental ... Translator Microbe injection with ... - Good . Good . Do it . any data that I un ... Ah ! How can he not learn his ancient tongue ? What kind of civilization doesn 't pass on its culture ? They 're warriors . Most of them didn 't learn to read or write until 300 cycles ago . It 's ridiculous . It 's savage . I 'll wager there are no artists or chefs there either . What is your problem ? I did it . You usually do . What ? I was in his ship . What ? I didn 't mean to . I ... You need to die horribly . Oh , like you never screw up . You 'd compare this to anything I do ? Don 't you think I feel bad ? because I think I can trust you ... - do not go near his ship . and what do you do ? - So what do you do ? Let 's just be a nasty little Nebari tramp ! - Only problem is , someone would have gotten your body parts Just shut up ! - Just shut up ! All right . - Okay . All right , you go . I didn 't actually touch anything in the ship . - I think actually the best thing to do is just to calm down ... Maybe it was something that Crichton did , - and figure this out . there 's no reason D 'Argo should be mad at me , is there ? - So I think the best thing to do is ... I just don 't know how can I make my point ... - get ready in case Pilot 's gotta blow Moya apart to save us . when you will not ... - Oh , skelnick , would you stop talking ! Okay . My personal , growing hatred for you will be set aside ... - and if you 'll just back me , I 'll never ask for Girls ! - Would you just let me speak ! What are you doing ? ! Huh ? ! Uhhh ... Having a conversation . - Yeah . Having a conversation ? Obviously very interesting . Listen , this is my only chance with these Translator Microbes . If it doesn 't work , be here , ready , okay ? Yeah . Now , you listen to me . D 'Argo has a lot on his mind at the moment . If we survive , you tell him anything you like . I just need to ... - No ! Do not ... do not tell him . Isn 't she great ? Yeah , I 'm thrilled with our relationship . Well , D 'Argo and I aren 't gettin along too good these days , either . Yeah . He put you in a coma . I gotta figure out what to do about that . How hard 's that ? You 're gonna die . Well , Scorpy thinks I should get revenge . Pilot wanted me to run , but that didn 't work . You got any ideas ? You once said to me that our species might be related . If that 's true , you have to have a measure of intelligence about you , which means you can reason . Be honest . Talk to him . Work out the problem . Conflict 's for barbarians . D 'Argo . I think it may have been me . I was in here earlier . I didn 't touch anything , I was just here . I found this in the control . Your hair ! Are you gonna to kill me ? I 've already hurt Crichton today . That 's enough . I didn 't mean to cause any of ... Well what did you mean ? I mean , what were you doing in here ? ! I know that I can be difficult . That no one wants to spend time with me . You 're someone who ... I like . And I know that since the problems with your son and Chiana , that you 've preferred to be alone . In here . I just thought , if this is so important to you , then maybe ... maybe if I learn a little about it , we might have something to talk about . Oh . Thanks for making the effort . D 'Argo , we 're friends , right ? And friends don 't let friends drive drunk . It 's just kind of ... Wow . You look great . Ha . Is this the best you could do ? I , uh ... I miss you . Obviously . Where are my clothes ? On Talyn . You and that other guy . The other me . You 're not , uh ... Mm , don 't do it to yourself , John . Right . Oh , no , no , no . Before you go , you fix this . Mm-hmm ... I get it . " I 'm not bad . I 'm just drawn that way . " Oh , please ! At least use some imagination . Happy birthday , Mr. Astronaut ... " Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou Romeo ? " Honey , that 's the wrong Shakespeare . There 's no place like home . Hey , Johnny . Like a virgin ? I 'll like ... rescue you . Can you do that Sharon Stone thing ? Basic Instinct ? Johnny , just say ... No ! There 's a good boy . Thank you . Now , what are you gonna do about D 'Argo ? I don 't know . I 'm supposed to talk to him . Not really sure what to say . Any advice ? Help ? D 'Argo . D 'Argo , could you just leave young Johnny alone , please ? Um ... No . Run , Forrest ! Run ! Ah ! Come on , D , let ... let 's talk this out . Ha , ha ! Never ! Ladies , coming through . Grr ... Captain , we hit something with the front of the ship . D 'Argo ! We 're friends , big man . How about a little rock , paper , scissors to work through your ... anger ? I don 't think so , John . You 'd really shoot me ? We could get counseling . I know a guy . Dr. Chuck Jones , wrote the ... Dr. Chuck Jones wrote the book on these situations . Jool , babe , you were right ... You think so ? You think you could reason with me ? - Clear ! Clear ! You feel the life ebbing from both of us , John ? The creep of cadaverous cold ? Achilles , I believe . Your strength as weakness . Your stubbornness has served you well in the past , but now it is killing you , John . These cartoons are a crutch , attempting to shield yourself instead of doing what is called for . Revenge . D 'Argo , the DRD should be there any microt . All I could do was piece together fragments of language , an incomplete vocabulary , at best . That 's all anyone could ask , Pilot . Let 's give it a shot . The DRD will inject you . Ow . What 's it say ? Shh . D 'Argo , you have to tell me . Active self-destruct code can be voided ... with one of three ... ah , predetermined artifacts , singular to Luxan heritage . Ancient freedom text . It 's very rare . An Orican 's prayer amulet . This is hopeless . ... Qualta Blade . What ? What ? What does it want ? What ? ... Qualta Blade . With so little time left , I suggest you all start to prepare ... Begin searching immediately . Now , I threw it over in this direction here . Why would you do that ? Short version ? ' Cause of you . Now , I heard it falling so it could be on one of those tiers down there or , ah , it could 've fallen all the way down to the neural cluster . So we split up and search . A caution . The DRDs use this empty cavern to deposit construction and repair refuse . It 's a reasonable risk . - Some of the ... Start searching . Hey , Pip . You got a sec ? Sure . You up on everything that 's going on ? Yeah . You 're dying . - Yeah . Scorpius wants you to get revenge . Pilot says run like a ... a scalded kepnitz . - Yeah . And Jool would talk D 'Argo 's ear off till he committed suicide . So , uh , what do you think ? Well , revenge is sweet . It 's always worth the effort . Ooh ! Why do I get the cellar and you guys get the catwalk ? This place smells horrible . Guaranteed by your arrival . Sugnil . Chiana . What do you want , D 'Argo ? What , I should bottle it up and become a Luxan ? Showing a little bit of self restraint wouldn 't hurt . Any luck ? Just crap . And dren . Hey Princess , watch out . Watch out for what ? Chunks of metal . Don 't get hit . There 's no metal down here , there 's just muck . Do you have muck ? Oh , yeah . Up to my crutch in it . Aah ! Chiana , Jool , watch out ! For what ? ! You little slut . No , no . It wasn 't Chiana , it was me . Then how did she know ? I don 't know . Just made sense . No revenge , no talking , no running . Come on , baby . You 're the sultana of survival . What 's left ? Be smarter . They always make it more complicated than what they need to . Use it against ' em . Screw ' em at their own game . That 's good . Pilot ? Yes , Joolushko . Are there ... other things living in Moya with us ? A panoply of harmless parasites , many serving symbiotic functions . Perhaps you 're hearing the Hodian trill-bat swarm . Do these Hodian bat things ... leave droppings ? Extensively . Their effluvium spreads along Moya 's inner hull and helps seal microscopic cracks . Bat dren . You 're walking through it . Missed me . Ha . Yo , D 'Argo . Look down . Ah ! Don 't you get it , D 'Argo ? Chiana was right . I can always outsmart you . You got to admit it . My wormhole looks a lot better than yours . You ... did not ... paint ... a wormhole ! You forgot to make yours swirl . Buh-bye . Well , this little spaceman 's going home . Lock up the women and hide the fried chicken ! I think I broke my leg . Did you think you could make up all the rules ? Keep hiding behind a cartoon forever ? No ! Dearly beloved , we are gathered here today to pay our final respects and to say farewell to our dear friend Commander John Crichton , a schmuck . Mule headed , reckless and probably brain dead before I met him . Alas , his death ... is mine also . Even I don 't know if it 's too late . We could already be gone . I love Aeryn . That should be enough . Oh , soft emotion won 't get the job done . Revenge ? Crichton to D 'Argo . Man to beast . Destroy the bastard , John . If only in your own mind . Marty Goldstein stole my bike when I was seven . I went over to his house and I gave him a bloody nose . Powerful emotion , revenge . I coulda just taken the bike back . Yes . But can you just take your life back , John ? I don 't wanna be like other people . I don 't wanna be like you . I don 't wanna stoop that low . Kirk wouldn 't stoop that low . Oh , that was a television show , John . And he made Priceline commercials . But if you insist . Then look to Kirk the way he really was . Savage when he had to be . He 's a fiction , Harv . I know the difference . I 'm real . I have to live with what I do . You can no more deny your biologic heritage than to change your grandparents ' birthplace . These primitive animal urges you think you must resist , they 're not relics from an uncivilized time . They are in you for a reason . Because you need them . No cartoons , John . You can take him . Eh , what 's up , D 'Argo ? I 'll tell you what 's up . I 'm going to kill you ! I don 't think so . Frell . Chiana . Still nothing . Pilot ? I will again suggest you head immediately for the escape hatchway . At least save yourselves . Good idea . About time ! Princess ? I have the Qualta Blade ! I have the Qualta Blade ! I have the Qualta Blade ! This is kinda like the sound you hear before you die . Or after . Okay , you frellnik , it 's your turn to die . On with the show , this is it ! No cartoons , no crushes . Revenge . I 'd like to thank the Academy for this beautiful Oscar . Oh , shut up , John . It 's not presentation night . You ought to be thanking me . For what ? For saving your life . Sorry , Harv . No joy . I gave it a shot . You could have been right . You were wrong . I don 't understand . 'Course you don 't understand . You live in the country but you do not speak the language . Just don 't ... don 't touch anything in here . You ... You 're clueless . No , John . Revenge . For you , it 's a way of life . For me , it 's not the answer . Then we 're dead . Don 't ever distract me from what I really feel . Harv , I ... love ... Aeryn . I appreciate your help , though . That 's all , folks . Identify yourself . Hey . I 'm Ka D 'Argo Son of Laytun , grandson of Reska , and I am the great-grandson of Ka D 'Argo Treytal . Power systems at your command , Ka D 'Argo . Telemetry functions at your command . Deception Shroud at your command . Sonic Accelerator at your command . Particalization Field at your command . Weapons Cascade at your command . Communications Array at your command . Eyes clear . You did it ! I did it . I did it . Hey , guys . The lights are all out . Maybe we should call someone . This stuff will not come off . Lucky for you it doesn 't smell . It smells terrible . Right . I mean , lucky for me we don 't share quarters . You know , I think you should just show a little more respect . Without my sacrifice you would ... We would have all perished . Moya and I thank you , Jool . You 're welcome , Pilot . Oh , if I were you , I 'd clean out that lower level if you ever expect me to go down there again . Yes , of course . Well , you won 't have to go down there again if you stopped frelling around with other people 's stuff . Excuse me . D 'Argo and I have already sorted all that . I 'm gonna take the first ride on his ship when he figures it all out . Oh ? Kids . Crichton , I know you 're out there . If you won 't talk to me , can you at least just listen ? Somehow saying I 'm sorry seems so inadequate . Ah , we 'll get through it . I 've so much rage inside . So many things . Sometimes , I ... I just need to control it better . Well , now would be a good time to learn . You got a baby ship to feed . It 's a curse , John . A warrior heritage , my instincts . You just gotta know when to control ' em , bro . We have a code . Aggression against an ally entitles retribution . D 'Argo , look at me . There 's nothing that would ever make me take revenge on you . Thank you . When you were dead , did you know you were dead ? I mean ... No . What went through your mind ? What did you see ? Buddy , that would be impossible for me to explain to you .

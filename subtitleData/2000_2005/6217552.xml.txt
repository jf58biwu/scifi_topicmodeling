 How can you say that ? Because it 's true . You 're exactly like a Sebacean . In what way am I like a Sebacean ? In that you think that you are superior . And that you treat the rest of us like animals . When have I ever treated you like that ? Only every time that we have to make a decision and you think that the best idea is your idea . Oh , yeah ! Oh , yeah ! They are going to write songs about the way you guys tore this place up . - Right . Go away . - I am away . - I 'm - on - vacation . - Pip , beat it . Has it occured to you why Pilot banished you from Moya ? Because you 're both acting like a couple of immature Dredgenaughts . - I can ' believe you pissed him off . - I didn 't piss him off . You pissed him off . You did . Grow up ! Or ignore each other , or kill each other , but just stop fighting all the time . I 'm out of currency . Here . Playland for the rich too classy for ya ? But you , you just keep on hunting for that long range cargo hauler of your dreams . Cause she 's bound to show up in you lap one day . When she passes out , I 'll , I 'll take her back to Moya . In the meantime ... I 'm gonna have some fun . I suggest you guys do the same . - See what you did ? - You did it . - You did . - You . You ... Yeah , right . You did it . This alien is Raxil . There 's one like her on every planet . And these girls ? No có ¿ ... We never did get their names . Ahh ... are you boys ... a couple ? - No . - No . Can you handle some girls looking to party ? I am a full-blooded Luxan . And ladies , I have so much cash in my pocket that I can assure you that the three of us will be out of here on our hands and knees come sunrise tomorrow morning . I 've been arrested for saying exactly the same thing on four different planets . Fe 'Tor . Bad guy . Dressed in black . Another bad guy . The guy with Fe 'Tor . Crichton ... Crichton , wake up ! Wake up ! Crichton ! - What happened ? - What didn 't happen ? Oh , God , there were girls , right ? Feathered chicks ... The , the ... Rainbow Coalition . Girls . Breasts . Blue breasts , green breasts , I don 't know . All I know is ... they spiked our drinks and took our money . - They rolled us ? - Yeah , they rolled us . - You know , these ... - My pulse pistol . ... shots that we took ? They spiked em . My pulse pistol ! They-they took my damn pulse pistol ! No one stole your pulse pistol . We 're on lomo ... no weapons allowed . Your pulse pistol 's on the transport pod . I don 't remember that . Where are my boots ? D 'Argo we 're in a window . There are people watching . I think they 've been there for about seven arns , so ... why don 't you just get dressed and give ' em a good show sweetheart . I am dressed . My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut ... shot through a wormhole ... . In some distant part of the universe ... . I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... this living ship ... of escaped prisoners ... my friends . If you can hear me ... beware ... if I make it back ... will they follow ? If I open the door ... are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... helpless ... for the nightmares ... I 've seen . Or should I stay ... protect my home ... not show them ... you exist . But then you 'll never know ... the wonders I 've seen . I said ten solar days away from Moya and I meant ten ! Pilot , gimme a break . I 'm tryin ' to tell you what happened . I understand , Crichton . However , my inclination is not to accept any explanation . Well , I can 't go back down there . I 'm persona non grata on lomo . LoMo non grata . Can 't do it , not goin ' , uh-uh . You return ... beat-up , inebriated and broke , after only two ! Yeah . But , that 's what I 'm tryin ' to explain to you . You said that if I could explain it , then I-I could stay onboard , right ? Proceed . How the hell did we end up in that window ? I don 't know . - You don 't think we , ah ... - I said , I don 't know ! Hey , don 't-don 't yell . It hurts . Have we heard from Jool or Pip yet ? - They haven 't been answering their comms . - Right . Go find ' em Lassie . It was your idea to come down here in the first place . You go frelling find them . Aren 't you worried about them ? Aw , hell , no . They 're probably sleeping ' off the fun they had last night . - Shut up . - Hey , don 't tell me to shut up ! You know , you 're the one who told em to have fun . Whadda you think fun is for Chiana ? - shut-up . - What ? ! John ... isn 't that the pile of dren we saw outside the window ? Yeah . Smile . It was also in the bar last night , wasn 't it ? I 'm so glad you 're not angry . Ya know , I thought you were gonna ... . Oh , what are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna scream ! - Don 't scream ! - Did you steal our currency ? What are you talking about ? I didn 't steal anything . I came over here to talk to you , you know ? But you looked so angry before when you were in the window ... - Not talkin ' about the window ! - All right . Let me give ya something here . I saw it all . - They 're in trouble . - Yeah , they 're gonna be in a lot more trouble when I find ' em . The green and the blue chick ... Not the blue and green chick . No , no , no . I 'm talking about your females . I 'm talking about the pretty gray one and the really annoying gold one . - What about them ? - They 're in trouble . I can show ya . I can show ya what happened last night . Let me go . D 'Argo , look . Chiana knows how to look after herself . We gotta find our money ... ... and I 'm pretty sure ... that this grommet is involved . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . I 've got something for ya . I 've got us a recording of all that happened last night . I mean , ya don 't believe it , you can see it for yourselves , ya know ? It 's talking crap . We got rolled , and I don 't think we need a ... You 're broke ... You can 't get robbed again . I mean , what do you think ? You think I want your shoes ? - I don 't know what you want . - You 're not very smart , are you ? Now he ... ... he 's got brains Now you , you 're a bit of an idiot , huh ? - Yeah ? - Yeah . - But , I 'm bigger . - Oh ! Ow-ow-ow . All right . Sorry-sorry-sorry . Alright . Alright . Ha-have you spoken to your females yet ? I 'll bet you haven 't spoken to them yet . No , we haven 't spoken to them , because they might be sleeping , they could be ... " Oh , yeah , princess . " How do I know you haven 't spoken to them yet , huh ? You don 't know that , do ya ? - No . Well , my point is ... - Will you just tell us ! ? - That 's Jool 's comm . - How do you know ? It 's melted around the edges from when she screams . Now . Do you want to see what happened last night or not ? 'Cause I could just , you know , not . All right , all right . You don 't have to push me . The point is , you see , we can be friends , you can trust me , you see everybody trusts me , ' cause I 'm a female of my word . - Oh , what is that ? ! - It smells like ... Shh , shh , shh ! Close ... but no . It-It 's miramar root , you know ? Kabaah uses it in all his pleasure elixars . Very low quality . But we don 't tell him that . Mr. Kabaah ? - Wake up ! - Don 't ... yell . Well , I have to , he 's as deaf as a feather . Wake up ! Go away . I don 't need your trouble . Trouble ? Me ? No , no , no . You must have me confused with someone else . I 'm not confused . I 've seen you snooping around , seeing you when you didn 't want me to . Is that ... a Han-jee ? A Han-jee ? I don 't believe you . What 's a Han-jee ? Creature with removable eyes . Optic nerves that continue to record and send back images , even after they 're seperated from the body . Leave ' em in somebody 's bed chamber ... ... You brought us to see a pornographer ? ! I 'm deaf , not dead . Stop talking like I 'm not here . What do you want ? I know you 've always got an eye hanging out at the lomo bar . So ? We 're looking for a Nebari and an Interon . You want ... the show . Yeah , yeah , that 's right . Who 's paying ? You don 't think you 'll get the show for ... free , do you ? We have no currency . You know that . Come on , you gotta have something . All right then , we are being scammed . Ren and Stimpy here are teaming ' up to rip us off . Let 's get outta here . This phanix ? I would never team up with her . Wait a minute , wait a minute . Just to prove to you ... I 'll pay . There . - Where did you get that currency ? - Why ? What 's the matter ? All of our brandar tiles were stolen last night . So ? Did you have your name on ' em ? No-No ! They aren 't yours , they 're mine , they 're mine . You two have really got to work on your attitude , you know that ? Kabaah , give ' em a tentacle . Put one of these on your eye . You gotta be kidding me . These will link back to the optic memory of last night , and act as a three-dimensional image of everything that happened in the bar . You want us ... to put one of your tentacles ... in our eye ? Don 't be such a grimmit Just do it ! This is , uh ... this is . D 'Argo , you-you see 'n this ? This is ... uh ... Well , it 's , uh ... it 's incredible . Kabaah , show us the females . Oh , hello . I can be bad . You 're jealous . All right . Yeah , this looks really dangerous . Those girls are in fear for their lives . Yeah , all right . Have you got anything else ? Kabaah , get your eye outta the gutter . Show them later ... later ! - That it ? - Yeah . You . You want me ? Watch . I just won a bet . Raslak . Make it a large . You smell so exotic . I like watching you dance . I like watching you and your friend ... but especially ... you ! Oh , big deal . She 's being hit on by some guy . Knowing Chi , he 's probably in more trouble than she is . Wait , there 's more . I have something for you . You ... I like the look of you . - Who is this bastard ? - That 's Fe 'Tor . Ow ! Whoa , whoa ! What the hell just happened ? You didn 't pay me enough to cross Fe 'Tor . - Who is Fe 'Tor ? - He was what I was tryin ' to show ya . Fe 'Tor 's the most famous kaznick around here . He rounds up all the good-looking ones and they all just party night and day , night and day . - What ? Does he ... do them ? - He hurts ' em . e gives ' em the whiff ... well , you saw . And then they do anything . I 'm not sure , but I think this is Fe 'Tor 's sister . Her freslin is still ... adequate . I 'm not interested in ... " adequate . " We gotta get your females out of there . - Do you know where we can find them ? - Yeah , got an idea . Whoa ! Hey , Whoa ! D 'Argo . D 'Argo , wait . What we saw is from last night . Chiana could not even be with that guy anymore . We can 't have another auction yet . It 's too soon , too dangerous . I think our female upstairs may be exceptional . For her , we can risk it . D 'Argo , why are you believing this Raxil thing here ? Chiana was having fun . She could be walking back into the bar right now , we don 't know . Well why don 't you go to the bar and wait for her ? - D 'Argo , I ... - It 's fine . I 'm just going to go along and say ... hello . Squeeze her dry . Well , I 've been comm 'n the girls . No answer . - Did you find ' em ? - Found ' em . Deliveries around the back . - Oh , oh , ' round the back ? - Yeah . Uh ... okay , thanks . - They okay ? - They 're fine . Jool ! Jool ! - Are you all right ? - Ah ! Oh , D 'Argo . - Oh , come in with me . Come on . - Where ... is ... Chiana ? Over there . Um ... ah ... we thought that perhaps you might be in some trouble . I 'm not in any trouble . At least none I don 't want to be in . Where 's Raxil ? She didn 't wait around like she said she would . That way . Ow ! Ow ! Did you see them ? Are they in trouble ? They were taking ... a bath . ... we saw him ... give you something . Some stuff . - Oh ... were you spying on me ? - No ... no . D 'Argo , I came here to have a good time . Does that make you jealous ? No . I 'm not jealous . It 's just that , ah ... 'Cause you and me , we 're-we 're not together anymore , are we ? Ah , no , we 're not together anymore ... Well then , let go of me . All right . You and Jool are coming with me . Let me go ! Chiana ? Everything all right ? - She 's fine . - Why don 't you let go of her then ? Why don 't you mind your own business , you miserable little tralk ? They had ... ... weapons ! You said ... it would be a party ! But they had weapons that they put to my head ! They had weapons ? ! Yes , but they weren 't pointed at Chiana . They were pointed at me . Please , please , calm yourself . I don 't like to show force . But you are in my residence and you are attacking my people . Now ... get out . Chiana ... D 'Argo , get out . Go ! Oh , we 're fine , D 'Argo , really . We 're just ... Uh ... D 'Argo ? You 're gonna kill her . At the moment , I do not have a problem with that . - What did you spray on him ? - Freslin . Stop ! Stop ! This makes no sense . You make no sense . What ? Wh-What doesn 't make sense ? She nailed him with love potion number 9 . It made him dance ? Well , it 's a way to meet girls . Pilot , just listen to this , all right ? This is important . This is about the deal . It 's about Freslin . LoMo 's dirty little secret . I suspect the dirtly little secret is you spent all your currency on pleasure and now ... Hey ! You know what ? ! It 's a weird universe out there man . You don 't know that ' cause you 're spending all your time indoors . Just ... let me finish my story . See ? See why I made us get off the beach ? - He would 've been chasing everything that moves . - And it 's all because of this stuff you gave him ? Freslin 's an attractant . You could be attractive to someone else , or they could be attracted to you . It could be strong , weak ... anything . Depends on where it 's manufactured . Did you like the Freslin I gave you last night ? Is this more ? Mm , different batch ... different quality . Want a taste ? Bring it on . - It 's different . - More better ? Yeah . An animal 's last batch always is . This is ... uh , this is from an animal ? A beautiful animal . Is this the same stuff , that that guy sprayed on Chiana last night ? Yeah . Grade-A Freslin . Made in his own lab . Fe 'Tor 's got the most sensitive nose in the business ! - What am I missing ? ! - Nothing . Here . Wonderful , isn 't it ? Yeah . Now . Will you do anything for me ? I 'll do anything for you . I think Fe 'Tor wants your females for more than just you know . What ... does he want them for ? No peeking . Can you smell it ? Just breathe it in . Well , the base element of Freslin is found in the senal gland of sentient beings . - Oh , you mean , like in ... people ? - Yeah . Fe 'Tor 's got a machine that milks this gland . And ... and when there 's a lot of demand , well sometimes he 'll milk them until ... they die . You 'll love it . Can I open my eyes yet ? Why did you not tell us this earlier ? John ... These people ... will not dance with me . - No one wants to dance - No . Go away ! - Look at the booty on that girl ! - The booty ? Sweetie pie . Why 'nt 'cha come with ... I should have told you everything , but I was scared . Fe 'Tor 's dangerous . If Fe 'Tor is so dangerous , why help us at all ? My mate , Sarl he 's with Fe 'Tor . He doesn 't look very well . I mean , he 's tall , he 's good-looking . I mean , look at me , I 'm a nothing . I tried to warn him , but ... I 'm telling you everything because , when you save your females , I want you to save Sarl . Isn 't that the guy ... that was with Fe 'Tor last night ? Yeah . That 's Mitols ... his right-hand shill . Well he could probably get us in to see the girls , couldn 't he ? 'Course he can , but he 's never gonna tell ya . Keep D 'Argo busy . I 've got some business . How ya doin ' ? Man , were you here last night ? Was that wild or what ? I drink alone . Yeah , I 'm not really ah , interested in drinking either , um ... I 'm lookin ' for some ah ... Freslin . And I heard that you were the guy to see . You like the Freslin ? Trust me . It only hurts the first time . Go away . Okay , okay , okay , look . . let-let me give you somethin ' . I am loaded with currency . And I 'm lookin ' for somethin ' a little special and this is the only crap that I 've been able to find . And , uh ... Kabaah told me that you were the guy to see to get some really serious dren . If they drained that much fluid from her , Crichton , she would be dead . Shut up and let me tell my story ! You really must relax . Struggle only makes it more painful . Hm ? Mm . That 's you you 're ingesting . Kabaah sent you ? Why didn 't you say so ? I just did . Apex of the moon tonight . Fe 'Tor 's chamber . Know where it is ? I 'll find it . We 're auctioning some incredible dren . This 'll get you in . My frelling head is killing me , from that spray , you little tralk ! D 'Argo , you can kill her later . Right now , we gotta get the girls outta Fe 'tor 's . So , what are we doing here ? 'Cause I 'm gonna help you , see ? I 'm gonna make you a sorta disguise . Hey , Hammerhead , how 'ya doin ' ? I 'm back for some home video . Get out , get out ! I don 't think so . I need to see into Fe 'Tor 's compound . No , I won 't help you against him . Yes you will , or I 'm gonna snap your head off . Now I 'm gonna see the compound layout . You 're gonna show it to me . I don 't care if it 's empty , but you 're gonna show it to me now . Eh , this is the auction room . Not bad , all it needs is a big screen TV . Ka-D 'A-go ! No ! ... It-It 's okay , that 's um ... that 's Harvey , it 's not Scorpy . He 's a puka . He 's ... he 's not real . But thanks to our unique shared conciousness in this situation , we finally get to meet ! Ka-D 'A-go ! - Give me five ! - Go away . I 've had some weird conversations in my head before , but this ... is a little ... Yeah , I know . Hey , look . Harvey just shows up every now and then to give me bad advice . And my suggestion to you both ... is to forget this folly . But ... since I know you won 't . Circuit breakers to the entire subterranean level . Darkness ... ah , may be of assistance to you . You know what ? I think that 's not a bad idea . And the milking room you seek ? Down the hallway . Kabaah , show us the milking room . Raxil , what is that thing ? That 's where they drain the bodies to make the Freslin . Pleasure Planet , my mivonks . We better count the steps in here . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven ... - ... eight . - ... eight , nine , ten . Ten steps . - Uh-uh , eight steps . - Ten . Eight ! Small legs , human . Jool ? Jool ! Jool ? - Something wrong ? - No ! No , no . I-I was ah , just tryin ' to find Jool . We should really be going . You really are quite beautiful . Yeah . Where 's Jool ? Don 't be scared . Everything 's all right . No , I will not go to Fe 'Tor 's auction . - He knows what I look like ... - I 'll get you in . ... so I won 't get in . And you 're not spraying me with that stuff . - This Freslin will be different . - I 'm not spending the rest of my life on the dance floor doing some ... - No ! You are not ! - Shut-up ! Just shut-up ! I did not do everything ... plan everything , so you could back out now ! - Did you say plan ? - No , no , no , I didn 't mean plan . I make a plan , like , like , - like plan something , you know ... - Did you say that you planned this ? ! No , no , no , no , I didn 't mean that , no , no ... I got everything from the Transport Pod . Two pulse pistols , a pair of night-vision goggles , 200,000 in tiles so we can buy any ... Freslin we want , uh ... - what did I miss ? - Two guns ? You brought just two guns ? This little rodent ... has been lying to us . - She said that she planned all this . - Two guns ? ! I mean , thought you were the great Crichton and D 'Argo ? I mean , you blew up a Shadow Depository . I mean , I thought you 'd bring pulse rechargers and a plasma bomb and a really big gunship ! But , no ! You bring nothing ! You bring two little weapons that wouldn 't kill a Negnec ! You ... have heard of us ? Yeah , I 've heard stories . But obviously they aren 't worth a bucket of dren ! What the frell have you done to her ? - Get her out of that thing , you fekkik ! - Chiana . She 's not in any pain . Don 't worry . Eh ? Here . Enough with the dren ! You really shouldn 't waste ... the taste . Now , I 'll let your friend rest , but I need to replace her with a new animal . Now , I knew Fe 'Tor wouldn 't bother your females while you were in the bar . So I paid the blue and green girls to get you out of the way . wait ! You let ... Fe 'Tor ... kidnap Chiana and Jool ? No , I didn 't help him . I just created a situation where everyone ... Is there anything else you 're not telling us ? ! Nothing , nothing . I promise . This little ... tralk has been lying to us all along . So , what I suggest is ... Ah ! Not again ! Please don 't hit me . Please don 't ... All right , you can hit me just once ! Just once ! - Hello ... ? - What ? ! I 've got a live connection . The Nebari ... Chiana ... They 've begun milking her ... think you 're going to be too late . Ah ... I was right ! You 're exceptional . Would you like a taste ? - Drain as much as you can . - Without damaging her value , of course . D 'Argo , you should check this out . D 'Argo ? Who the ... hell ? ! Oh , you know ... the Freslin I sprayed him with , radiates his pheromones outwards and creates an auro-morph . So , we all see D 'Argo like this . I made him very attractive ... don 't ya think ? What ... are you talking about ? D 'Argo ? No more ! Enough ! Even I am not so gullible as to believe that D 'Argo turned into another ... creature . I do not appreciate the lies you tell in order to circumvent ... Whoa , ho ! Hold o How long have we known each other ? Approximately two and half long cycles . I ever lie to you ? Hmm ? Hmm ? D 'Argo looked totally different . Look at myself in the mirror ? I ... ah ... And why does he not look that way now ? Metabolism ? Look , man , let me ... can I please tell the story the way I wanna tell it ? Mitols is almost ready for the Nebari . What should I do about the other one ? Wring curls ... drain till failure . She would only spoil the program . I am your host . But names are not important ... only currency . Well , son , I 'm your buyer , and ah ... money ain 't important to me ! Only quality . Know what I mean ? You 've come to the right auction then . I recommend the Nebari . - Finest I 've ever tasted . - Right . Raxil alive , still . I thought you 'd given the Freslin trade away after your disaster on Elepuria . Well , yeah , I did lemme tell ya , but uh , things change . Enjoy , Bid high . Excuse me . Do I know you ? Hi ... I , ah ... I doubt it . I 've become a ... a new man recently . " I made him very attractive . " 15,000 on my right . Have I any further bids ? 16,000 , 16,000 on my left . There , any further bids ? Going once , twice , three times , are you all done ? 16,000 , sold for 16,000 brandars . You traded Freslin . Wait , wait , wait , wait , years ago , never killed anybody , none of it . - None of it , my ass ! - No , no , no . My point is , you must calm down . Increased oxygenation hastens the metabolism of the Freslin ! It 's gonna wear off ? Not for a while , not if he stays calm ! Calm . Anger ; bad . D 'Argo ... be cool , man . We buy the girls , Raxil 's mate , if we can . No guns , no killing and we 're outta here . I 'll watch you from up here . Distinguished friends ... we now come to the sale you 've been waiting for . I present ... the olfactory genius ... Heska Fe 'Tor ! Does this guy just scream Vegas , or what ? Heska Fe 'Tor ! Friends ... welcome . Thank you for coming on such short notice . What a fine auction this will be ! May I present to you ... Chiana ! Metabolism , Luxan . Bidding starts at 25,000 . 25,000 30,000 . 40,000 . - 50,000 . - 55,000 . 60,000 ! 85,000 . What a wonderful bid , Heska Tinako . Are there any others ? No ? 125,000 . 130,000 . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to take a closer look at the carcass ... Be my guest . Hey , Pip . Can you hear me ? Go away . What took you so long ? 150,000 . 151,000 . Do you mind cutting ' this heifer down , so I can take a closer look . Where 's Jool ? Milking room . Wait , wait , wait , is she yours ? Used to be . Look , you 've got Freslin boiling in your brain . Everything you feel 's way out of whack . What 's going on down there , that 's an act ! He 's just pretending to be a buyer ! 175 . 250 . One quarter million brandars ! " Circuit breakers ... to the entire subterranean level . " I can double that bid if you give me some more time . No more time . Currency ... on hand . Top the bid now , or step aside . Sold ! To Heska Tinaka for 250,000 brandars ! Did you have to caress her whole body ! - Oh for cryin ' out loud ! - It 's just the Freslin ... it makes him , you know ... Shut up ! Listen up ... Mister Horney Toad ! Jool 's still in the milking room . I 'm gonna hit the lights , and get Chiana . Good , good , good , good . Ah ... well get Jool , and her mate and then we 'll wait . And remember , ten steps down the hall . Eight steps , human . Don 't do anything till I hit the lights . No , no . Yeah , the lights . Good . This is all your fault ! If you hadn 't bribed those women in the bar ... none ... Easy , Luxan ! Easy ! It 's the Luxan ! Security , move ! Frell . Raise you fity-dollahs . Chiana ! - No , no , that 's not right . - It 's eight . - No , no . He said ten . - Shut up I know what I 'm talking about , it 's eight . You 're making me lose my place ! Eight , eight ! Shut up ! You 're wrong ! Okay . Ten . Drop your weapons . Jool , are you okay ? Who 's that ? That 's my mate . He 's dead . D 'Argo , save me ! - Crichton . - D 'Argo ! Where 's Raxil ? In there ... The mate is dead . Right , meet you in the Pod . Raxil ! This ... is my honey ! The brains of the machine . My design ! He stole it , sold it . Fe 'Tor didn 't even know it was mine ! Worth and fortune and all ! How 's your neck ? It 's ... fine . I don 't mind sticking ' it out for you . You don 't want these broken . You okay ? - Yeah . - Good . Weird . You ruined everything . You smell ... exotic ! Smell this . - Neck still okay ? - Yeah . I knew it . Sad thing is ... he 's gonna die happy . ... and that is what it was all about . Raxil ... she was gettin ' her chip back , and she used us . She used us , man . So it is not our fault . I don 't ... believe you . Why not ? Too many ... inconsistencies . Too much ... obfuscation . Obfuscation ? How the hell does that translate ? Fine , you know , look , you don 't wanna believe me ? Go ask the girls ! Chiana and Jool are still sleeping off whatever it was they did , and I 'm not inclined to wake them . Pilot , I don 't think you 've understood me . Lemme just start again ... Crichton ! No ! have located another planet nearby Industrial . Comms traffic indicates they have ... accomodations for visitors . You and D 'Argo are to be ... visitors . Pack what you need , we shall return for you in eight solar days . Pilot ... - it was real . - Perhaps ... John . However , Moya and I desire time away from your constant bickering . And this adventure , however embellished , does not alleviate that need . Get out of here . Okay . You know , you really should get out more ... these things do happen . - What , he didn 't believe you ? - No . - Well , what was that thing about a " slim duck " ? - Slam dunk . Whatever . It doesn 't matter , - He 's throwing us off Moya ! - Yeah , well , you want to give it a go ? No . - See . I did my best . - Your best was to blow it ! - I did my best ! - Well , you blew it ! D 'Argo he 's kicking us off Moya ' cause we argue . He 's kicking us off Moya because you argue ! - No , we argue . - You argue ! - We ! You ... - You argue . We argue ... you would argue with a lampost ! - I do not ... open the door . - You open it . You open the door ! What , you 're a girl , I 'm gonna open the door for you ? Open the door ! I-I 'm older than you , show some respect ! You open the door . - You can open it ... I 'm not opening ' the door . - I 'm not opening ' no door ... you open it .

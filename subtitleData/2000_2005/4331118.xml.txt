 Come in . You wished to see me . We 've known each other for how long ? Approximately 20 years . We 've served on three starships together . I was present at your daughter 's Kolinahr . I consider you one of my closest friends . And I regard you with the same esteem . I 've always been honest with you , but you 've been keeping something from me . I don 't know what you mean . Don 't you ? It took exhaustive research , sifting through teraquads of data , separating fact from rumor ... but eventually , I arrived at the truth . Captain ... Happy Birthday . Thank you . So , it 's not long before you hit the big three digits , hmm ? Indeed . Have you informed anyone else of your discovery ? Don 't worry , Tuvok , my lips are sealed . Well , you 're supposed to blow out the candle . That is not a Vulcan custom . Humor me . Captain to the Bridge . Well ? It was a fire hazard . We 're receiving a distress call - - a small vessel on an intercept course . Life signs ? One . It 's Ocampan . We 're being hailed . Kes ? Captain Janeway ... I need your help . Will you please give me permission to come aboard ? Of course . What 's happened ? Please , let me come aboard . Prepare the docking port . Tell the Doctor to stand by . Her ship is accelerating . It 's on a collision course . Janeway to Kes . Cut your engines . You 're coming in too fast . Five seconds till impact . Lock on a tractor beam . Evasive maneuvers . Hull breach on Deck 9 ! Emergency force fields . Captain , a transporter was activated just before impact . She 's beamed aboard . I 'm reading bulkhead ruptures - - Deck 1 1 , Section 17 ... 18 ... 19 . Cause ? Unknown . I have located Kes . She 's moving through those sections . She 's giving off high levels of neurogenic energy . Janeway to Kes . Kes , respond . Hull breach , Section 20 . Force fields . Security to Deck 1 1 . Force fields are not holding . She 's approaching Main Engineering . Bridge to Engineering . Intruder alert . Stop where you are . Kes ? State your intentions . Evacuate Engineering . Warp power is fluctuating . Torres to Bridge . Kes is in direct contact with the warp core . She 's drawing power from it somehow . Shut it down . Warp power is returning to normal . B 'Elanna , report . Lieutenant Torres is dead . Kes has vanished . And send Mulcahy . He 's in deflector control . We 'll need more power to Junction 12 - J , and tell Harry I want to talk to him about building a new energy grid . Lost ? No , just looking . Captain Janeway suggested that I get more familiar with the ship . Well , if you have any questions , let me know . Thanks . We 're about to run a diagnostic on the warp core assembly . You can watch if you want . Thanks , but I really should be getting back to Sick Bay . Computer , how long has Voyager been in the Delta Quadrant ? 56 days , 17 hours . Back so soon ? I thought you went to the Airponics Bay to collect herbs . I forgot something . Ah . Pyong Ko . Excuse me ? You encouraged me to choose a name , remember ? Pyong Ko was a 21st - century surgeon who discovered the genetic sequence for inhibiting cancer cells . It heralded a new chapter in Earth 's medical history . That 's a perfect name , Doctor . Hmm . Then again , I 'm also considering Schweitzer , Jarvik , Pasteur . There are so many options , each with its own merits . Why don 't you give it some more thought ? You don 't have to decide right away . Of course , it 's not that I require one for reasons of vanity . I 'm just a hologram , after all , but if I had a name other than " Doctor " or " Hey , you , " it might encourage the crew to treat me with a little more respect . Kes ? Hello ? Neelix ? You know , Neelix , if you want to put your own stamp on it , maybe you should give it your own name , like " the Greasy Neelix , " or the , uh , " Double Talaxian with Cheese . " Ah. lt has a nice ring to it . Thank you , Lieutenant . I 'll keep that in mind . Sweeting , what 'll it be ? The usual ? I 'm not hungry . I thought that I 'd bring Captain Janeway some coffee . That 's very thoughtful . I 'm looking forward to tonight . Actually , I have a lot of work to do in Sick Bay . But I already reserved the holodeck . I thought we could take a moonlit stroll through the marshlands of Oshionian Prime . Another time . I promise . Something wrong ? Bad morning . Anything I can do ? I 'll be fine . I 'm not having a great day , either . Nobody seems to like today 's menu . I tried blaming it on a replicator malfunction , but no one believed me . Wait. I ... I think I see something . Neelix to Security . Kes 's frown is losing its structural integrity . Red Alert . I 'm detecting a smile . That 's my Kes . The coffee ? That last attack nearly cost us our impulse drives . Fortunately , B 'Elanna found a way to reroute power from the deflector . A good choice for Chief Engineer , if I do say so myself . Getting to know your enemy . I feel like I already do . Remember the old story ? A man goes to Risa , where he meets a beautiful woman who invites him for an evening of passion . He wakes up in the morning feeling wonderful , until he discovers he 's missing a kidney . Every cadet about to go on his first shore leave hears that cautionary tale . Doesn 't seem so outrageous anymore , does it ? No , but the Vidiians are more than just your garden - variety monsters . I 've been studying their culture . They were a lot like us before the phage . Do I detect a note of sympathy ? Makes you wonder what we 'd do under the same circumstances . Come in . Oh , you read my mind . Vidiians ? I 'm afraid so . We 've picked up two more ships on long - range sensors . I 've gone to full tactical alert . We 're taking every precaution . I 'm sure you 'll get us through it safely . Thanks for the vote of confidence . Tuvok thinks he 's found a way to penetrate their shields . The next time they attack us , it won 't be so easy . That 's good to hear . Captain to the Bridge . On my way . Oops . I ... I 'm so clumsy . I 'm sorry . Don 't worry about it . This desk has seen its share of coffee spills , believe me . Ensign Wildman has an intriguing proposal . We 've been analyzing the Vidiian bio - readings from the last attack . Their immune systems have been compromised by the phage . We could synthesize a neural agent that would incapacitate them without affecting us . Might come in handy if we 're ever boarded . Exactly . Work with the Doctor . When you 've got something , find a way to deploy it through the environmental systems . Aye , Captain . The ships we detected earlier have disappeared from our sensors . Maybe we outran them . They wouldn 't give up that easily . Why would they ? Voyager 's the only organ bank within half a parsec . We fought off their first attacks . Now they seem content to show up on sensors just long enough for us to change course . It 's like we 're being herded somewhere . If we maintain our present course , we 're gonna enter a region filled with subspace vacuoles . We 'd have to drop to impulse to get through . Sounds like a good place for an ambush . The Maquis used to lure the Cardassians into the Badlands . Those Galor - class cruisers had nowhere to run . Neither will we , unless ... Tom , how dense are those vacuoles ? They cover about 70 percent of the region . Excuse me , Doctor . Tom , what 's the first thing they teach you about maneuvering at warp ? " Faster than light , no left or right . " When possible , maintain a linear trajectory . Course corrections could fracture the hull . Exactly . We 'd have to drop to impulse every time we made a course change , but what if we let Voyager do the driving ? Ma 'am ? We could preprogram every kilometer . That way we 'd only spend a second or two at impulse every time the computer executed a turn . Auto - navigation the entire way ? No offense , but the neural gel packs can calculate vectors a little faster than you can . B 'Elanna ? We 'd need a more accurate scan of the region . If we even graze one of those vacuoles ... We could send a shuttle ahead . The Delta Flyer . Its sensors are more advanced . The Delta what ? Forgive me . I ... must have been thinking of another starship . Prepare a shuttle . I want all of Voyager 's systems operating at peak efficiency by the time Tom gets back . If we 're going to pull this off , there 's no margin for error . Dismissed . Computer , display an image of the Ocampan homeworld . Plot a course from Voyager 's current position . Homesick ? Lieutenant . Tom . It 's okay . A lot of people on board feel the same way . I spent my entire life trying to get away from Ocampa . Why would I want to go back ? Because it 's home . Home for me means a penal colony . Out here , I get to fly a state - of - the - art ship , and there 's no admirals in sight . What are you doing ? Getting ready for a scouting mission . You planning on going somewhere ? Uh , no , of course not . I was just studying the helm configurations . I didn 't know you could pilot a shuttle . I can 't ... but I 'd like to learn . Well , then , why not learn from the best ? I could start you off on the holodeck on an old class - 1 . That 's the kind of shuttle my father used to take me up in . That would be very nice , Lieutenant . Tom . Identify yourself . It 's me , Tuvok . Naomi Wildman . May I help you , sir ? Lieutenant , is something wrong ? Hello , sweeting . I took the liberty of preparing one of your favorite meals . It 's under replicator program " Neelix 1 . " Call me if you 'd like some company . Miss you . Computer , end music . Open an encrypted channel . Direct the signal to the following coordinates . Channel open . My name is Kes . I 'm aboard the Starship Voyager . Respond . I know you 're receiving this transmission , and I also know that your attempt to capture this ship will fail . If you want to harvest Voyager 's crew , I suggest you answer me now . Explain . Captain Janeway is aware of your ambush . She 's found a way to evade your vessels , but I can help you . I 'm listening . I can send you tactical data on their shields , weapons - - everything you need to take this ship . This is a deception . Do you want this crew or not ? In return ? Safe passage to Ocampa for myself and one other . Why would you sentence your own crew to death ? They 're not my crew . They abandoned me a long time ago . Computer , access Voyager 's tactical database . Command authorization required . Access granted . Naomi Wildman ? She appeared to be half Ktarian . Ensign Wildman 's husband is Ktarian . I met him once on Deep Space 9 . There 's more . I followed her to Cargo Bay 2 , where l saw a woman and two children , all with cybernetic implants . Borg ? I can 't explain it , Captain . I 've had hallucinations before , but only while in a state of deep meditation . These were specific , and they evoked a sense of anticipation . It almost sounds like you 're describing a premonition . Indeed . I didn 't think Vulcans had premonitions . They don 't . That 's what concerns me . Computer , maintain a continuous proximity scan of Lieutenant Tuvok , ten meter radius , all sensor parameters . In case you have any more " visions . " A logical plan . Bridge to Captain Janeway . Go ahead . We 're approaching the vacuoles . On my way . Last chance to take the long way around . It does feel like we 're sneaking through a graveyard at midnight . Any sign of the Vidiians ? Not yet , but it 's a safe bet they 're in there . Tom ? Trajectories laid in . Our trip will take three hours , 12 minutes , 1 1 seconds , with 216 course changes . Well , let 's get started . Engaging at warp 8 . Sit back and enjoy the ride . One of the vacuoles shifted position . The computer 's adjusting our vector . Dropping to impulse . 2.3 degree turn starboard . Jumping to warp 6 . One down , 215 to go . I 'll be in Sick Bay . Dropping to impulse . New heading : O - 31 mark 2 . There 's a ship approaching . It 's on a collision course . I 'm not reading any ship . Lieutenant ? Permission to be relieved , sir . I am not well . Of course . The molecular structures appear to be stable . Good . Report . We 've devised a neural agent that should inhibit the Vidiians ' motor functions without causing any permanent damage . Good. I don 't want to add to their health problems . I just want to keep them from adding to ours . I 'll get to work . Doctor ... when was the last time you examined Ensign Wildman ? I performed her annual physical six weeks ago . Did you find anything unusual ? She 's in perfect health . This may seem like a strange question , but I need to know if she 's pregnant . I 'm not at liberty to disclose that information . Doctor - patient confidentiality . What about " Captain 's orders ? " Sorry . Medical protocol supersede your authority in these matters . The security of this ship could be at stake . She planned on telling you herself . Boy or girl ? Female ... half Ktarian , as a matter of fact , which should nearly double the infant 's gestation period . How did you know ? And they say I 'm rude . We 're receiving a distress call . Life signs ? It 's Ocampan . Kes ? Let me come on board . Her ship is accelerating . It 's on a collision course . Hull breach on Deck 9 ! Emergency force fields . She 's approaching Main Engineering . State your intentions . Let me come on board . It 's on a collision course . We 're receiving a distress call . Bridge to Engineering . Intruder alert . Stop where you are . Kes ? State your intentions . Warp power 's fluctuating . Torres to Bridge . Kes is in direct contact with the warp core . She 's drawing power from it somehow . Shut it down ! Problem ? Hey . Torres to Sick Bay . Medical emergency . 20 milligrams lectrazine . Cortical stimulator . We 'll start at 20 millijoules . - Ready . - Now ! He 's gone into synaptic shock . I don 't understand . Can I speak with him ? I think it 's best to keep him sedated for now . When did this begin ? Earlier this afternoon in Engineering . Time ... I need the exact time . Lieutenant Torres called Sick Bay at 1422 hours . Computer , display proximity scan of Lieutenant Tuvok at 1422 hours . Oh ... Captain ? Tachyons . I beg your pardon ? There was a surge of tachyon particles just before Tuvok collapsed . That could have triggered this , but where did they come from ? They 're normally caused by temporal distortions . Time travel ? Let me know if his condition changes . Kes ... you have telepathic abilities . Have you experienced anything unusual during the past couple of days ? Hallucinations , premonitions ? No , nothing . If you do , you 'll let me know ? Of course , Captain . We 're low on neuro - stabilizers . I 'll go replicate some more . Hurry back . Where 's the tactical data you promised us ? I 'm downloading it now . I 'll transmit it to you once you 've arrived . I need it now ! Janeway 's already suspicious . If I transmit it now , I 'll be discovered . That 's your problem . Apparently it 's yours , too . Gentlemen , scan for tachyon particles deck by deck . Tachyons ? Do it . Looking for something specific ? I 'm not sure . Report ! We 're under attack . A Vidiian ship is closing on our position . Battle stations . We 've lost warp drive and weapons . They 're cutting through our shields . Remodulate . I 'm trying . They keep matching the frequencies . We 've still got impulse . They 've taken out navigation . I can 't plot a course . They 're cutting an access route through the hull . Evacuate Deck 3 and seal it off . Bridge to Sick Bay . Are you ready with that neural agent ? Aye , Captain . Stand by to release it on Deck 3 . Acknowledged . 50 milliliters should suffice . Doctor ! Doctor to the Bridge . Environmental controls aren 't responding ! Harry , what 's going on ? We 've been locked out of that system . What do you mean , " locked out ? " The command relays have been fused . They knew where to find us . They knew our shield frequencies , which systems to target ... We 're being boarded ! I 'm reading an EM fluctuation . It could be a transmission . Location ? Airponics Bay . Who 's down there ? I 'm picking up two bio - readings . The sensors must be malfunctioning . They 're both reading as Kes . Security to Airponics Bay . Shut down control functions to that section . I 'm going down there . Something tells me we 've got more than one battle on our hands . Computer , initiate site - to - site transport . Program Kes beta - 6 . Unable to comply . Control functions have been disabled . Shh ! Shh ! Shh. I 'm taking you home . We 've got weapons back . Can you target those hooks ? Not at this range . We 'd breach the upper hull . It 's better than being dissected . Reverse the hull polarity . Maybe we can shake them loose . Now , one of you doesn 't belong here , and I 'm guessing it 's you . Tuvok 's premonitions were real . You 're from the future . A future I 'm about to change . You 're helping the Vidiians , Kes . Why ? ... Security to Deck 1 1 ... Tell me why you 're doing this . I won 't let you hurt her again . I haven 't done anything to harm her . You took her from Ocampa - - her home . She 's a prisoner on this ship . No one 's a prisoner here , Kes . I was a child . You corrupted me with your ideas . What ideas ? Exploration , discovery . I believed you ! Hull polarity loosened their hold but not by much . It 's a start . Reroute the deflector . Have it discharge antigraviton pulses along the hull . Engage the inertial dampers . Get a controlled pitch going . In three years , I 'm going to leave Voyager in search of higher things , because you encouraged me to do it . You encouraged me to develop my mental abilities . I wasn 't ready . But what I found ... I couldn 't control it . It scared me . I had nowhere to go . I thought of returning home to Ocampa , but I had changed too much . I knew they 'd be frightened of me . I knew they wouldn 't accept me , but they 'll accept her . You don 't have to destroy this ship , Kes . We can help you . No. I trusted you . Kes ... No ! We 're breaking free ! They 're trying to lock on us with a tractor beam . Reverse thrusters . Full power . That could tear the hull apart . Then tear it apart ! Photon torpedoes - - full spread . Ready ! Fire ! It 's set to kill , Kes . Janeway to Bridge . Status ? The Vidiians are in retreat . Everything all right down there ? For now . She was here ... in my last premonition . She appeared older . Her face was tired . What was she doing ? She had her hands on the casing , as if she was drawing energy from it . The tachyons are concentrated here . It 's possible she needed the core to travel back in time . If that 's true , then she 'll need it again . But we don 't know when that 'll be . We have to be ready . Doctor to the Captain . Go ahead . Kes has regained consciousness . What do you remember ? I was in Airponics , and then I felt dizzy , and then I was watching myself . Yourself ? Computer , deactivate EMH . What I 'm about to tell you stays between the three of us . Understood ? Yes , Captain . Something terrible has happened ... or , more precisely , will happen . We 're going to need your help to prevent it from happening again . It took exhaustive research sifting through teraquads of data , separating fact from rumor ... but eventually , I arrived at the truth . Captain ... Happy Birthday . Thank you . So , it 's not long before you hit the big three digits , huh ? Indeed . Have you informed anyone else of your discovery ? Don 't worry , Tuvok , my lips are sealed . Well , you 're supposed to blow out the candle . That is not a Vulcan custom . Humor me . Captain to the Bridge . On my way . Well ? It was a fire hazard . We 're receiving a distress call - - a small vessel on an intercept course . Life signs ? One . It 's Ocampan . I 'd almost forgotten . We 're being hailed . Red Alert . Raise shields . Captain ? All hands , this is the Bridge . Begin emergency evacuation of Deck 1 1 . Repeat : All hands evacuate Deck 1 1 . You heard her . Get moving ! Now ! Open a channel . Kes . Captain Janeway ... I need your help . Will you please give me permission to come aboard ? Of course . What 's happened ? Please , let me come aboard . Her ship is accelerating . It 's on a collision course . Five seconds to impact . Tuvok . Lock on a tractor beam . Evasive maneuvers . Shields are holding . Her ship is intact . Captain , a transporter was activated just before impact . She 's beamed aboard . I 'm reading bulkhead ruptures on Deck 1 1 , Section 17 ... 18 , 19 . How did you know ? Ready ? Shut down the warp core . You have the Bridge . Remember me ? The innocent child you 're here to save ? You blame Captain Janeway , but the choice was yours . You made the decision to leave Ocampa , and you made the decision to leave Voyager . If you 're watching me now , you 've come back to take revenge on the people who cared about you . That 's not who you are , and that 's not who I am . Don 't do this . Find another way home . Captain Janeway will help you if you give her a chance . Try to remember who you were . Try to remember me . Don 't you remember ? You made that holo - recording , because you didn 't want this to happen again . Three years ago , you traveled back in time . Kes , you wanted to take that woman with you , and you were willing to hand the rest of us over to the Vidiians to do it . It didn 't work . You forced me to kill you , Kes . If you go back now , it 'll all happen again . Just before this terrible thing happened , you told me you had nowhere to go . That 's not true . Stay here with us . I can 't . I don 't belong here . I need to be with my own people . You told me you had the ability to get home , but you were afraid the Ocampans wouldn 't accept you . Why ? I remember ... What ? What do you remember ? The holo - recording - - l remember making it . You asked me to help you to help myself . You wanted me to remember who I was . These years were so filled with confusion ... and anger. I ... I buried the memory . I 'd almost forgotten . Does it really matter which Kes goes home ? A few snacks for the journey home . You do still like leola root ? Thank you . What ? Just looking . See anyone you know ? Only you . Good - bye , Kes . Captain . What should we tell the others ? A friend got lost . We helped her find her way .

 ( grunting ) Here you are . ( gasping ) You sure you should be exercising ? Why not ? Well , ' cause a little while ago a commando skewered you with his Swiss Peacekeeper army knife . The muscles are completely healed . Do you want something ? Yeah . Your Comm 's on the blink . We called you three times for dinner . Not hungry . No ? Next time answer . It 's kind of rude not to reply . Leave me alone ! Yeah , sure . As soon as you tell me what the problem is . Hell , Aeryn , what is that ? ( groaning ) You 're ice cold . All right , knock off the completely healed crap and talk to me . Better yet , we 'll talk to Zhaan . Closest thing we got to a doctor . No , don 't summon the others . Just let me get to my Prowler . Your Prowler ? What , you going to go for a drive ? Last I heard , we weren 't within Prowler ... No , you are not going to die . I didn 't lie to you . My muscles are healed . But that knife must have pierced my paraphoral nerve . And once that is damaged , it doesn 't regenerate . So within fifty or sixty arns , it 's going to fail , and I am going to die . There 's nothing you can do about it . There 's something we can do . The only treatment is a tissue graft from a genetically compatible donor . Fine . We 'll find someone . We 've got , what , two , three days ? At best . And we 're nowhere near a Sebacean colony . ( Aeryn groaning and panting ) But we are near a Peacekeeper base . Less than twenty arns and those commandoes were kind enough to leave the address . You aren 't just fahrbot ; you 're magra-fahrbot . I did it before ; I can do it again . Yeah . By the skin of your mivonks . Rygel : Your masquerade as a Peacekeeper fooled four battle-weary commandos briefly . Infiltrating a top-secret Gammak Base is quite another matter though , John . D 'Argo : When you get inside the base you 'll have to find a tissue match . And obtain a tissue sample . Rygel : If he 's found out we 're all put at risk . Will Moya be able to get us out of here with her pregnancy so far advanced ? So what are we saying here ? We do nothing ? We let Aeryn die ? is everybody happy with that ? No , John . I do not want Aeryn to die . Zhaan : Nor do I . Well you could 've fooled me . What about you , Guido ? How do you feel about this ? Look , what 's the difference what we want ? She is dying . We must face reality here . The only sensible course of action is ... Crichton : I 'm sorry , Sparky . What were you saying ? is to do everything in our power to save Aeryn 's life . Right . Even though it 's likely to get us killed . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . ( coughing ) This mission is foolhardy , Crichton . It makes no sense for you to be killed as well . Let 's just cut our losses . Drop the martyr routine , Aeryn . I 'm not going to let you die . Pilot : Crichton , we have reached the designated coordinates . Thank you , Pilot . Do humans have some sort of ritual for occasions like these ? Well , there 's the handshake . Followed by " good luck . " Good luck . How was that ? Perfect . ( sniffles ) Pilot : The planet is an uninhabitable gas giant , but it has a large moon on the far side . Large enough to have an atmosphere , Pilot ? Yes . The base must be located there . In this orbit , the planet 's huge mass will shield us from it completely . ( electronic beeping ) Hey , got to love a man in a uniform . Yeah ? Well , I love a girl in gray . Traveling outfit . Yeah ? You going somewhere ? With you . Think again . I 'll think out loud . What you need on this jaunt is a talented burglar and destruction causer . You 're volunteering ? What 's the angle ? I want to earn my keep aboard this boat . You ? No. I don 't think so . At least take this . Peacekeeper ident Chip . Maximum security clearance . This is Larraq 's . How 'd you get this ? Told you I was talented . All right , fine . I could use the help . If you 're going to help . We 'll pull the same routine we pulled on those Marauder commandos . You 're the boss man and I 'm your meek little server . Sure you don 't want me to fly this thing ? You know how ? Yeah . Do you ? Oh , yeah . You should see my lmmelmann . Check this out . Chiana : Looks like some kind of mining complex . Maybe a refinery ? Looks like it 's been nuked . Long time ago , big time . Could be camouflage . Could be dead . Ah , it 's not dead . Eight targeting systems have just locked onto us . Typical warm Peacekeeper welcome . ( electronic warbling ) Prowler to Gammak Base . What 's with the weapons locks , you idiots ? Can 't you tell a friend from a foe ? Heskon : Prowler , identify yourself . On an open channel ? I don 't think so . You want to count my teeth , do it after I land . The channel is secure. lf you don 't identify yourself , we will ... You 'll what ? Shoot me down ? It 's not a good idea to gun down a superior officer without first checking his ident Chip . Prowler , you have a landing vector . Crichton : Thank you so much . You 're not completely untalented yourself . Thank you so much . I 'm Tollona Javio , Commander of this base . This is Lieutenant Heskon . And you would be ? Larraq . Captain . And don 't even think of asking what my assignment is . I wouldn 't dream of it , Captain . But we do need to see your ident Chip . ( electronic warbling ) ident Chip verified , sir . Satisfied ? Delighted to have you with us , Captain . Though I am wondering how you knew this base was here . Keep wondering . I 'll need quarters for myself and for my personal server . Your ... ? Larraq , make sure the quarters are comfortably cool . It 's hot in here . You brought a civilian with you . You 're getting nosy . Just admiring your taste . May I offer food and drink to you and your server ? I 'd love some refreshment . Chiana : Hmm , I could get real fond of this place . The raslakis good and strong . Heskon : is that how you like it ? Mmm , strong and hot . Makes the mouth tingle . Help it go down smooth and slow . I 've never seen a species quite like hers . Males outnumber females here ? Five to one ? What do you poor guys do for fun ? ( chuckling ) Not very much . Well , I 'd say I got here just in time . What did you pay for her ? You don 't want to know . Does she give good ... value ? She has her moments . Excuse me , Captain . Duty calls . So ... I 'm ... Chiana ! Front ! What the hell are you doing ? You acting like a trollop was not part of the plan . They bought it , didn 't they ? You 're drawing a lot of attention . The more they look at me , the less they look at you . Do you think that before they elect you centerfold of the year , we could get on with the business of saving Aeryn ? ( breathless sigh ) Your quarters have been assigned . Level four , number six ierg five . You 're so helpful . I 'll need your ident Chip , sir . Again ? ( electronic warbling ) lf you would place your hand in here thank you , Captain . You know who we are . Let us past . Sir , everything beyond this point is Security Three Velka . Genetic verification required . Chiana : is this really necessary ? Larraq gets so impatient with delays . Captain , I must ask you to place your hand in the device . And I must ask you , Lieutenant , who are you to give me orders ? I can give you orders because I 'm a Chief Security Officer , Captain . Not for long , if this is how you treat your superior officers . You will comply , Captain . Computer : Analyzing . ( beeping ) Computer : Genetic scan verified . Satisfied ? He 's only doing his job . Let 's get to our quarters so I can do mine . Crichton : Well , I am for that . I 'll take you there immediately . Six ierg five. I 'll find it myself . Yes , sir . How the hell did we get away with that ? Did you do something to the chip ? ( Woman whispers ) Larraq . John . Gilina . What are you doing here ? is Crais here ? No . I 've been assigned to a new development project here . To do what ? They haven 't told us . I assume it 's something to do with developing weaponry of some kind . New weapons ? In Peacekeeper hands ? Yeah , just what this galaxy needs . It 's okay . She 's a friend . How did you know I was here ? I saw you in the Officers ' Lounge , wearing that uniform . I knew you 'd never pass a genetic scan , so I overwrote the security program . You did all that ? What , from here ? Yes . Crichton , this is a very good friend . Not acceptable , Commander . We must increase the efficiency of the Aurora Chair . I 'll need more techs , sir . I 'm understaffed . Understaffed or mismanaged ? We 've also got to find a match for this tissue sample of Aeryn 's , or she 'll die . Can you help us ? Of course . Stay here. I 'll take the sample to the Medical Unit . No , no , no. I 'm not going to put you at risk . I won 't be. I can fake the work orders and the Med Techs won 't ask any questions . We 're used to secrecy . It 's still too dangerous. I 'll go . John , you should stay hidden . Suppose somebody here knew the real Larraq ? Well , she 's right . One close call 's enough . Yo , pip . I 'm going to go back to the lounge , and let our good friend , Mr. Chief Security Officer buy me another raslak . Come home alone . Oh ! I came to see how you were doing . You came to see if I was dead so you could start going through my possessions . Oh ! I resent your unfounded accusation . Furthermore , you have no possessions worth taking . How inconsiderate . Yes . How terribly inconsiderate . Rygel , you are needed on Command . I am ? What for ? A quick decision may be required if the Peacekeepers arrive . Hmm . A quick and correct decision . I accept this vital responsibility . Thank you . If a warrior cannot die in battle , she can at least die alone . Talk about having something to remember him by . ( laughing ) Duty cycle complete , Lieutenant ? Oh , no , sir . Commander Javio . I was ... leaving . Oh , I thought I 'd get at least another round out of him . Raslak . We can do much better than that . Zhaan . Aeryn is deteriorating fast . This is no way for someone to die , even a Peacekeeper . D 'Argo , all I can do is ease her journey . The nerve that was damaged regulates toxin removal functions . The poisons that are building up in her body , they 're killing her . Well can you filter them out ? I have no means to do that . Zhaan , Moya does , doesn 't she ? Not a bad way to live . Not at all . How would you like to stay ? Whatever you 're getting from Larraq , I can easily double . I 'm getting quite a bit . 'Course , I 'm worth it . I think you 're selling yourself short . Covert Op types are always flying off to some backwater planet and getting shot up . This is much more civilised . I am getting real tired of running from system to system with a guy who 's got a real talent for getting himself into danger . Exactly . With me , you 'd be comfortable and protected . Shall we continue this discussion in my quarters ? My policy 's no free samples . Let me , uh ... let me consider your offer on my own . Good news . You find a match ? Even better . We don 't need to find a donor . Our medics can now synthesize paraphoral tissue . Right . How long will it take them to cook up a batch ? They already have . One dose , some bed rest , and she 'll be as healthy as ever . Thanks doesn 't even begin to cover it . You don 't have to thank me . I better get back to the ship . If I 'm late , Aeryn dies . And I wouldn 't even dream of stopping you . We always seem to be saying goodbye . Yeah . You 'd think we 'd get better at it . Go . That man . He is an impostor . Seize him . Get him up ! ( electrical pulsing ) My name is Larraq , Peacekeeper Special Ops . Unfortunately , wrong , on all counts . ( pulsing increases ) ( grunting ) I am Scorpius . But of course you are Peacekeeper . Funny , you don 't look like a Sebacean . On the other hand you do look Sebacean . Yet your energy signature is quite dissimilar . What species are you ? And who are you working for ? Get stuffed . ( electrical crackling ) You attempt to provoke me . Perhaps you were hoping I will lose my composure and kill you before I 've extracted any information . I long ago learned the advantages of patience . ( electrical crackling ) ( groaning ) ( yells ) What the hell was that ? A memory . Random and indistinct at the moment . It will take some time to map your neural patterns . You stay the hell out of mind , you fr ... ( screaming ) That was a Leviathan ship , was it not ? I seem to remember a report of an escaped Leviathan prison transport . Have Javio check the data files . You are a most interesting spy . ( screaming ) ( rhythmic gurgling ) This may help stabilize you until Crichton returns with the cure . Are you sure this won 't hurt Moya ? Pilot says no . The amount of toxins your body generates is insignificant to Moya , relative to your sizes . What about her baby ? D 'Argo : The baby 's already well over a sakmar . This will not affect it . Well , whether it works or not , Zhaan , I commend you on your ingenuity . Actually , it wasn 't my idea. lt was ... it was Pilot 's . Crichton 's been captured . Can you find out where they are keeping him ? I can 't access main control . They must have shut down the main grid because they suspect someone is helping him . Sooner or later they 're going to find out who . ( yells ) ( strained ) : Waste ... of ... time . I 'm not a spy . Javio : According to the report , the Leviathan had a Delvian , Hynerian and a Luxan aboard . No mention of a creature like him or his female accomplice . Whom you have yet to locate . You charged my brother 's Prowler in that white death pod of yours . You 're talking about that near miss I had the first minute I got here ? That was an accident . It was no " near-miss " for my brother . That was Captain Bialar Crais . The Leviathan escaped from his convoy . Scorpius : As I recall , he received special dispensation from the Council to head into the Uncharted Territories and hunt it down . Right , but First Command lost contact with his carrier some time ago . I want to see more of that . I can 't locate it again , sir , but I 've found something linked to it . ( yelling ) Tauvo is dead . Struck down by a weak , pathetic , inferior being . You will die in my hands . I suspect our Captain has turned renegade . Broadcast a wide-dispersal message , coded to Crais 's Command Carrier . Direct him to come immediately . You think he 'll actually show up ? Certainly . Tell him we have his prey . What do you think ? Will it work ? I don 't even think John would recognize you . Let 's track him down and find out . ( screaming ) ( grunting ) Your memory holds an impressive array of other races , Crichton . You 're quite a well traveled spy . For the ninth time , Nosferatu , I am not a spy . His previous missions are unimportant . I want to know who sent him here , and why . Keep searching . It 's deja vu all over again . ( laughing ) ( screaming ) Jack Crichton : There are but a few planets where we can live . The ancients have stories of a world that will welcome us . We can only hope they 're true . ( beeping ) Malfunction ? Niem : No , he 's put up a neural block . It wasn 't me . Damn , don 't you hate it when the batteries go dead ! Scorpius : Break through it. increase the extraction level . ( screaming ) Jack Crichton : These equations are necessary for creating a wormhole . I don 't remember that . You 're teaching me how to ... No . You cannot access this data consciously . You won 't remember this part of our encounter . We will not give you wormhole technology . Crichton : Why not ? Jack : If you 're not smart enough to discover it on your own , you 're not smart enough to handle it wisely . You 'll have to find it yourself . The unconscious knowledge we 've given you will guide you , nothing more . That 's all that we can do for you . But that should be enough . You are already on the right path . Well , well , well . Our spy has an interest in wormhole technology . He ... he gave me the equations . And that 's why you came to this place . What 's this base got to do with ... That 's why you built it ? ( laughs ) All this research . ( laughing ) You 're trying to create a wormhole ! ( laughs hysterically ) As are you . That creature knows how . But he wouldn 't tell you , would he ? Or so you thought . ( gasping ) So you sought that knowledge here , never realising that you already had it , locked deeply away . Find it . Segment his mind . As many layers as it takes . No ... no . Please ... ( screaming ) Or his mind will simply liquefy . He seems to be an exceptionally strong species . A short recuperation and then we 'll start again . Hey ! Hey ! You don 't put that thing in here ! I don 't want a roommate ! Get it out ! Hey , that 's my mat ! Now get off my mat ! Go on ! Go ! Fine. I don 't want any trouble . This is my side . That 's your side ! This is my side ! You stay on your side ! My side ! Your side ! My side ! Your side ! My side ! Your side ! You were just in my chair , too , weren 't you ? You talking about Scorpius 's chair . Ah , Scorpy . Scorpy puts me in the chair over and over and over and over and over ... The chair did this to you ? ( babbling ) Danger ... Danger , Will Robinson . Beware of the chair . Beware of the chair . The treatment 's working . But all it seems to be doing is stopping her from deteriorating further . Why didn 't you want me to tell her it was your idea ? Earlier on , Aeryn told me she wanted to die alone . As a warrior , I should respect her wishes and not interfere . You did a good thing . You may have saved her life . Despite her words , she really didn 't want to die . I don 't even believe that she wants to die alone . Pilot ! Pilot , are we under attack ? No. lt 's Moya . She 's having muscular contractions . is she giving birth ? I 'm not sure . It 's killing Aeryn . We 've got to stop the treatment now . Hold her down . Right , Pilot ! Isolate Aeryn now ! Let 's hope Crichton gets here soon . This should bypass the grid and hook us directly with main control . Spare me the technobabble , Gadget Girl . Let 's just get on with it . Again , Scorpy ! Thrill me again ! Excuse me , sir . Captain Crais has arrived . Where is he ? Where 's Crichton ? Scorpius : This way , Captain . Crais : I have orders to recapture the Leviathan and its passengers . Captain , Crichton has vital information . Until I get it , you may not have him . I order you to release him to me . Your adherence to orders is selective . You have repeatedly failed to cease the pursuit and return to First Command . ( chuckling ) I have received no such orders . Your dereliction of duty is not my prime concern . Give me your full cooperation , and you can have Crichton , when I have finished with him . Give me Crichton now , and I 'll get you all the information he possesses . Torture alone would be ineffective . Only the Aurora Chair can extract the information we need . But the chair might well kill him before you find it . Therein lies the stalemate I must break . You know this human better than anyone . What would persuade him to stop resisting the chair ? ( beeping and clicking ) I found him . He 's in a cell on level nine . Hey , I may be able to patch into it . Let 's see . ( static over speaker ) Gilina : John ... John . It 's Gilina . Keep your back to the wall camera and it 's safe to talk . I 've bypassed the audio in the monitoring station . How you doing ? You okay ? Are they onto you ? No . Chiana and I are in hiding . Chiana , are you there ? Listen , I stashed the tissue gizmo under the checkpoint . Third intersection past the T. You got that ? Got it . Good . Go find it and get it back to the ship . We 've got to get you out of there . No , no . Forget about me . Just get the sample back to Moya . Aeryn can 't have that much time . John ... ( door opening ) There 's somebody coming . ( laughing ) Crais . How do I get out of this place ? Once I take off , they 'll blast me out of the sky before I 'm half a metra . I don 't understand it . Why wouldn 't Crichton try and save himself ? Chiana , does Aeryn mean that much to him ? No . Aeryn 's just a ... just a shipmate . Crichton is in love with you . Why do you think he 's staying ? Look , once Aeryn 's okay we 'll come back with the reinforcements . Get the both of you . Yeah ? Okay . If he wants me to go with him . Let 's get you out of here . You are dead , Crichton . But you have one choice . Do you wish to save the lives of your shipmates on Moya ? ( scoffs ) What are you talking about ? Why do you think I 'm here ? I 've recaptured the Leviathan . The fugitives are back in my custody . However , whether I deliver them alive or dead is up to me . How do I keep them alive ? Scorpius : Stop resisting the Aurora Chair . Allow us to probe freely , for any information we wish . That 's not a very good option . You are not in a very good position . So , everybody on the ship 's okay ? Zhaan ? Aeryn ? They 're all unharmed , as is the Leviathan . They 're all in perfect health . That could easily change . Fetch the comfy chair . ( beeping ) There. I 've programmed a blind spot into the targeting system . Keep your Prowler on this trajectory and they won 't even see it . How will I know if it works ? You won 't get blasted out of the sky . Great . Now all I have to do is get to the Prowler . Well I 'll give you a diversion . How much head start do you think you 'll need ? Give me 400 microts . Go . One more , sir . Please ! Please , one more ! I got my mind right , boss . Be nice . We will . ( groaning ) Where are you going , Tech ? Sorry , sir ? Where are you going ? I ... I 'm , uh ... level three , sir . The Commander 's quarters . Please forgive me . Peacekeeper : On your way . Niem : Report . Level six clear . Five ... four ... three ... two ... one . Computer Voice : Evacuation warning . Reactor overload . Evacuation warning . Evacuation warning . Reactor overload . Evacuation warning . Reactor overload . Javio : Clear the area ! Get everyone away from the reactor core ! Emergency radiation gear is on level ten ! Commander Javio , wait ! Sir , this Prowler is non-operational . There 's a faulty component in the , uh ... in the froonium drive , causing instabilities in the ... the stabilizer . Uh ... it may have been fixed . If I could just have a look . Very good , Chiana . But I thought the Commander was meant to be the last one to evacuate . It 's funny. I believe just the opposite . We could both leave . Continue our earlier discussion . It won 't work twice . ( screaming ) ( groaning ) ( sighs ) ( hypodermic hisses ) What was that ? A tissue sample . Crichton succeeded . I 'm not going to die . D 'Argo : As you once said to me , " you will die , but not today . " Are you sure about that ? I 'm starting to hallucinate . You make a worse Peacekeeper than Crichton . Oh ... Glad to see you 're okay . Where is he ? I want to see him . You will . Soon . She should rest . Great idea . Some of us desperately need to bathe . D 'argo ? I 'll stay here and watch over her , just in case . Thank you . Niem : The reactor warning was a false alarm . Sir , a Prowler has launched without authorization . It has vanished . There are no sensor readings at all . Crichton 's accomplice . One of them , anyway . The false alarm was a diversion . Who triggered it ? We don 't know , sir . We 're still checking . ( laughing ) ( groaning ) Crichton will tell us . ( screams echoing )

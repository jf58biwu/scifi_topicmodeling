 Pick up ! Pick up the phone ! Look , I don 't know what that bitch told you ... but I 'm solid ! She 's lying to you . Check her right-hand desk drawer . It 's all there , the whole story . Pick up , man ! Call him off and let 's talk about this , all right ? Give me a chance to explain ... Help me ! Somebody wants to kill me ! Who wants to kill you ? - He 's out there ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa ... Hold it ! Hold on ! Don 't do that , guy ! - Now you calm down ... - Please , we 've got to stop him ! - Who ? - He 's out there ! We have to get him before he gets me ! Anthony ! Take him down , take him down ! Let me up ! He 's gonna kill me ! Take it easy . Relax now . Settle down . No ! This isn 't enough ! I 'm not safe in here ! Hey , buddy , you 've never been safer in your life , okay ? Just relax ... He can get me in here ! I 'll go call Social Services . Right . It 's not enough ! He can get ... to me ! He ... They 've identifiied it as nine millimeter pistol ammunition ... Teflon-coated armor piercing . It 's a single round . He was shot , there 's no doubt about that . So I assume the million dollar question is , \ x22How ? \ x22 Yeah . Well , what do we know about the victim ? Carlton Chase , age 39 , well-to-do realtor , single ... lived in the area all his life . Nothing but parking tickets on his record . Came tearing in here last night ... saying someone was going to kill him . He was right . Except I don 't see any bullet holes in the walls . Well , the round looks to have entered ... through the top of his head . Agents . Thanks for coming down so quick . - Al Triguero . - John Doggett . Nice to meet you . Agent Scully . - Agent . - Hi . I 'd appreciate any help you can give us . We got this much ... fiigured out so far . Bullet came through the air vent . Yeah , that 's how it 's looking . There 's a little burr on this louver right here ... where the bullet passed through . You can barely see it , but it 's there . So , I 'm thinking ... this is where the killer hid . He somehow crawled into this ventilation system , and from here ... he had a clear line of sight to shoot Chase below . Did anyone hear a gunshot ? Seems pretty likely you 'd hear one . Even with a silencer , it 's going to echo through the ductwork . What 's directly above this ? I don 't understand . How could someone make that shot ... from here ? They didn 't make it from here . Can I use your pencil ? Sure . Captain , we 're going to need ... your crime scene investigators up here . You got it . So , lucky shot ? Very . But this victim here stated that he was going to be killed ... just moments before he was shot . Which doesn 't sound lucky at all . Guess I can 't argue with that . What you got there ? The old Godfather trick . Wrap a towel around a pistol to muffle the sound . The killer was up here , all right . So how in the hell did he make that shot ? Well , there 's thermal imaging technology ... which can pick up body heat ... through walls . Maybe that 's ... what allowed him to aim . We fiield-tested that in the Marines . It weighs close to 90 pounds ... and has to be cooled with liquid nitrogen . I can 't quite see somebody lugging it up that ladder we just climbed . Either way , the rooftop ... of a police station ? That 's a pretty ballsy place for a hit . Pick up ! Pick up the phone ! Look , I don 't know what that bitch told you ... but I 'm solid ! She 's lying to you . Check her right-hand desk drawer . It 's all there , the whole story . What are you doing ? My , um ... printer cable is loose . And that 's more important than coffee ? Any messages ? No . Well , the light 's blinking . Looks like a message to me . You going to play it or what ? Stupid ain 't cute , Tammi . I don 't care what your mama says . Yeah , uh ... I got , like , rats ... again . I need you to get them all ... this time . 1806 Brook Valley Turnpike ... last name Allesandry . You 've been here before . Dwight ? Yeah , I got it . No , uh ... did you hear the news this morning ? Carlton Chase ? Well ... I-I just thought it was pretty scary news . Try and get Randall on the phone . Randall ? Your brother wants to see you . Randall ? You avoiding me ? Tammi told you I wanted to talk to you , right ? You want to tell me what happened last night ? Look , Randall , I 'm not mad at you necessarily . But I need to know exactly what happened . Look , anytime you decide to do something ... without telling me fiirst ... you could get us both into trouble . I saw him stealing . Carlton stealing from me ? Yeah . He was skimming . So where 's the money that he was skimming ? You see , the thing of it is , Randall ... you get the money , then you do your thing . It 's a simple equation . That 's what I 'm talking about ... when I say you need to talk to me fiirst ! It 'll probably be okay . But in the future ... let 's keep the communication lines open . One hand talks to the other , right ? Here , I brought you a sandwich . Meat loaf the way you like it . Go ahead , take it . It 's got mayonnaise and ketchup . We going out tonight ? Police station 's less than a mile from here . Chase ran it on foot . He says that somebody was after him . This is probably where it all started . Huh . What 's that ? Chase did a lot of business with an exterminating company ... called AAA-1 Surekill . Six jobs in one month . Well , I know ... that 's a requirement of selling a house . Agent . It 's a .45 . The bullet that killed Chase ... at the police station was a nine millimeter . You know , Elvis used to do this to his hotel rooms . I think Carlton Chase did this . So who was he shooting at ? If it was someone in this room , he damn sure would 've hit them . Unless it was someone outside . I got three keys . You got the cash ? What 's this look like ? Who the ... Evening . What ? You lost ? Nope . I think this must be the place . What , you a cop ? Oh , hell , no . No , your secret 's safe with me , fellas . But , uh ... I will be taking that money off your hands . And the dope . Oh , you 're funny . Now , you know what ? Chris Rock is funny . And you ? You 're just dead . Yeah , cap his ass . Bang . Bam . Bang . The fiifth . Yeah , I got it . Nine millimeter ... Sulfuric ... No , I don 't need you to spell it . All right , thanks . So which kind of shooting was this : lucky , coincidental or some third alternative ? Well , it 's precision marksmanship , that 's for sure . These holes line up perfectly ... with the three victims behind there . which tells me that the shooter was standing ... right here behind this wall . And consequently wouldn 't be able to see ... what the hell he 's aiming at . Unless he could see . The light our eyes can register is only one small portion ... of the electromagnetic spectrum . Other wavelengths ... from infrared to gamma , have other properties . X rays , for instance , can pass through solid objects . Walls , for example . So you 're saying this guy used some kind of x-ray machine . Wait , you 're not saying this guy has x-ray vision ? I 'm remarking that these ... wavelengths exist ... and that the only thing that is stopping us from seeing them ... if you will , is the biochemical structure of our eyes . I 'm conjecturing ... that if this structure were somehow different ... we 'd have the ability to see things that we don 't . Call in Clark Kent . Okay , so you explain it . Well , I can 't ... so I 'm sticking with what I do know . Which is ? That this was a drug rip-off . Furthermore , it 's the fiifth drug rip-off ... in this area in the past two months . Somebody 's making a living capping local drug dealers . And how does a dead real estate agent fiigure into that ? Well , that I don 't know yet . But I did fiind out one more thing : sulfuryl fluoride . You got a moment to see me in my offiice ? Dwight , I need to get this to the bank . It can wait . Can 't you tell your brother ... to get some lunch or something at least ? He 's practically right outside the door . I 'll keep the noise level down if you will . I just feel like he 's always watching me . Well , how 's he watching you now ? Hello ? Anybody here ? Yeah . Agents Doggett ... and Scully , FBI . Dwight Cooper . What can I do for you ? Mr. Cooper , do you recognize these ? Well , I don 't recognize much of anything ... except shapes . Tammi ! Come look at this for me . I got bad peepers ... legally blind since birth . This look familiar ? They 're ours . Last month 's billings for Mr. Chase . Oh . Carlton . He was one of my best clients . I sent him a ham every Christmas ... till he fiinally told me he was a Jew . He 's a nice guy . We found some evidence at a crime scene . A piece of fabric on which we found ... traces of a chemical ... sulfuryl fluoride . It 's an insecticide used only by licensed exterminators . Yeah , it 's good stuff . We use it ... along with about 200 other outfiits in central Mass . You 've done time , haven 't you ? Yeah , a long time ago . Now my brother and I are actually members ... of the Worcester Chamber of Commerce ... if you can believe that one . Anything else ? Yeah . Why did Carlton Chase call this offiice ... 14 minutes before he was murdered ? 8 : 34 p.m. We found a call to your offiice ... billed on Mr. Chase 's calling card . It was made from a pay phone ... not far from where he was murdered . Wow . I don 't know what to tell you . We 're all gone home by that time ... and there wasn 't any message on our machine . All right . We 'll be in touch if we have any further questions . Tammi . What do you know about that ? About Carlton calling here ? Well , he ... I guess he must 've left a message . What did it say ? I didn 't hear it . I was reaching for the play button ... and I hit the erase button by mistake . I should 've told you . I was just afraid ... that I lost us some business maybe . Come here , baby . You know , I can 't see worth a damn . I just want to have a look at your eyes . The eyes are the windows of the soul . They tell you everything you need ... to know about a person . So tell me ... are you lying ? No , Dwight . That 's all I needed to know . Dwight Cooper , arrested in 1986 ... for grand theft auto . Right . How does a legally blind guy steal a car ? Well , I assume that he had a partner who did the driving . The brother he mentioned ... Randall Cooper . They were arrested together . Although Randall apparently didn 't serve much time . They share the same birthday . They 're twins . I hate twins . Twins never rat each other out . Well , maybe there 's someone in that offiice who will . Hey , Tammi . You 're here early . You know you accidentally left your car running ? You must have been in a real hurry to get in here ... and make the coffee . What you got there ? Can I see ? Dwight Cooper . FBI . Dwight Cooper , warrant to search . Have someone ... read it to you . What the hell ... are you looking for ? Evidence related to the murder ... of Carlton Chase , et al . What 's in the box ? You got me . What 's the combination ? I don 't remember . So much for the easy way . You owe me for that . I run a clean business here . You 're not going to fiind anything ... that 's going to say otherwise . I wouldn 't be so sure . Can you explain these , Mr. Cooper ? So , Mr. Cooper , you want to tell me about these invoices ? Okay , Randall ... let 's talk about your exterminating company . It 's just the three of you , right ? You and your brother and Tammi Peyton ? So , how is it ... that your little company billed over $ 700,000 to Chase Realty ... last year ? $ 700,000 . That 's a lot of dead rats . I think ... that you and your brother and Carlton Chase ... were in a whole other business together . Man , I got to get into the bug business . I had no idea ... you could make so much dough ... killing things that creep around behind walls . You are quite the entrepreneur . I 'm just a regular Joe , providing a public service . Randall ? I 'm just a regular Joe providing a public service . Is that what your brother just said to Agent Doggett ? You know why I said that , don 't you ? Because somehow ... you can see through that wall . You can see your brother behind me ... and you can read his lips . I don 't know what gives you the ability ... but I know how you use it . You shoot drug dealers ... from places where they can 't see you ... and then you ... and Dwight rob them . That 's how you make all that money , isn 't it ? No . We 're exterminators . Yeah . You certainly are . And talking to you now ... I think that the whole thing is Dwight 's idea . It 's time to be your own man , Randall . It 's time to think for yourself . You tell them anything ? No . I said what you said . Well , we got a problem . It needs to be taken care of . I just keep the books . You keep the books ... on a whole lot of blood money ... going through that offiice . We 're supposed to believe ... you didn 't know what was going on ? The drug rip-offs , the murders ? I didn 't know about any of that . Dwight doesn 't tell me anything . I just book the cash receipts . I don 't ask where they 're from . I know not to ask . Look , here 's where I get confused ... and I 'm hoping that you can help me out . Carlton Chase . We think Chase ... was Dwight 's fence . He sold the drugs your boss stole . Together , they had a good thing going . So why , then , was Chase killed ? It seems like bad business . Unless the reason wasn 't business . Unless it was personal . Am I under arrest ? Tammi Peyton 's phone records . Found something interesting . Calls to Carlton Chase . All of them late night . What do you want to bet ... they weren 't discussing escrow accounts ? So Dwight Cooper learns that something 's going on ... between his girlfriend and Carlton Chase . And he kills him . Or he orders him killed ... assuming Randall 's the triggerman . Maybe not . What do you mean ? Maybe Dwight 's not the one who 's jealous . I know it was you . I still need help , Randall . I 've made a reservation for the 3 o 'clock Bus go wait for me . It 's right over there , the Big Sky Express . I 'll be back right after I get the money . I know you took that book to protect me from Dwight . I need my book , Randall . I can 't get my money without it . I 'll be back in a half an hour , okay ? I 'll meet you by the bus . Randall ... Well , you know I 'm coming back . You saved me from Carlton . I owe you . Randall . I 'll meet you by the bus . Clothes are gone . Tammi left in a hurry . Maybe she thought someone was after her . Someone 's after you , you don 't pack . You leave with what you 're wearing . You think she planned to go ? I do . The question is , where ? Who are you calling ? Whoever Tammi called last . Welcome to Concordia Bus Lines . Our menu options have changed . For reservations , press one . - Tammi . - Dwight ! Is this what you had in your little secret box ? Hmm ? A safety-deposit key . Looks like you had a lot of my money in there . Dwight . Shut up and drive . Drive ! So this is how you did it , hmm ? You kept two sets of books . Huh . You 've been ripping me off for months . There 's a hundred thousand dollars difference here . That 's why you were in such a hurry the other morning . - Dwight . - Shut up ! Randall should 've killed you , not Chase . Or maybe you and Carlton were working together ? It wasn 't like that . When Carlton found out about the money , he blackmailed me . He made me ... do things . Oh , I bet you put up a big flight . Wait a minute . If Carlton wasn 't stealing from me ... then why did Randall kill him ? Dwight , you don 't understand . No , no , no . I do understand . My brother was sweet on you . He killed Carlton because he knew ... what was going on between the two of you . No ! Where the hell you been ? Hmm ? I got something for you to do . Randall , get over here ! Dwight . No . Take it . She ripped us off , Randall ... and you knew it . No , Randall ... What did you think ? That the two of you ... were going to run off into the sunset together ? She used you . Look at me , Randall . I 'm the one who loves you , not her . Not anybody else . Because we 're blood . That 's thicker than anything . I 'm going to walk away now ... and I 'm going to think hard about how I can forgive you . You know what you got to do . Randall . You 're not going to do this . Randall , please . I was coming back for you . No , you weren 't . Randall ! No ! Agent . Has he said anything ? Well , a county D.A. came in ... and he declined representation . Aside from that , he 's been uncommunicative . APB on Tammi Peyton 's a wash so far . The Bureau in Montana 's on alert . He watched her every day ... wherever she was . A man who can look at anything in the world ... and he chooses her . He must 've seen something in her she couldn 't see in herself . Well , if you 're suggesting he could see into her heart , Agent ... I think we 're out of FBI territory on this one . I 'll be out front .

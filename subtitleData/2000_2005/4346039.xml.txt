All right ! Elzar , you 're my god ! Please sign this sketch I drew of you ! Elzar ! Bless you ! Now , this is why I prefer your non-stick robots . All right ! Yeah ! I hope you folks like Cajun food . Because we 're making down-home Neptune-style gumbo . Step one : Boil some oysters in a pot of Neptune-style gumbo . Boiled ? Interesting ! - Bender , try to be a little quieter . - No , you shut up ! Now and then , knock it up a notch with your spice weasel . Bam ! Yeah ! Bam it again ! Knock it up a notch ! Who let him into the studio ? Come on ! Work that weasel ! Quit holding out ! If you stop interrupting , all right . Against my will , I 'll knock it up a notch . I gotta film this notch-up knocking . Think fast ! My eye ! I 'm blind ! Tell me , doctor , how 's my cyst ? Grande . I don 't like this doctor . I 've lost more patients than he 's treated . What does this look like ? A grayish blob ? Right . And this one ? A grayish blob ? Not as right that time . You have some corneal irritation . Nice try , little boy . You may have textbook knowledge and a real diploma but I have more skill in my claw than you have in your whole body ! You seem tense . Try these . Sure . Butter me up with candy . Well , it won 't work , sonny ! Why always the fighting ? Your eye needs rest . Wear this patch for a week . A week ? What do you think , Dr. Zoidberg ? Clack . Thanks for the help , Leela . Leela ! We 're right here ! I 'm not deaf ! I just have to wear a patch . Does it look stupid ? No ! It looks so nice , I think I might get one too . It 's Elzar ! I 'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants ! Let me make this up to you . You 're all invited to my restaurant . I 'll bam up a dinner you won 't forget ! - All right ! - Yeah ! Hooray for blind-ey ! Oh , God . I 'm coming down ! Watch your mouth because your taste buds are going on vacation . I made you each your own special meal , so dig in ! It 's the biggest platter I 've ever seen ! Jerk chicken , jerk beef , jerk pork ! Is there any meat he can 't jerk ? The king crab is to die for ! Look , a tiny , edible crown ! - What 's it made of ? - Wood . Oh , Fry ! You gotta try this sterno-nicoise . It 's robot food . It 's so good ! Just try a little . No , really , I don 't ... Are you all right ? Oh , yeah , the salad 's fantastic ! So fresh . Oh , my ! That steamed carrot was a bit spicy . Enjoy the dinner ? - Are you kidding ? - God , yes , Elzar ! I enjoyed cooking for you . And to make everything square I want you to have these chocolates . What 's this ? Take care of that whenever you want . - Hey ! - A bill ? You 're charging us , after you blinded me ? I made a nice meal . This ain 't a charity . - Twelve hundred dollars ? - Holy zombie Jesus ! We don 't have that ! Especially not him . They took away my credit cards . I know how to take care of this . No problem . You 're all under arrest . It 's a stone cold shame . He 's making a break for it ! - I was picking my nose . - Picking his nose ! Get him ! My daddy owned a restaurant and punks like you made him fail . That 's why I 'm a cop . Now it 's payback time . Oh , yeah . Don 't hit me ! I 'm brittle ! Wait ! I 've got the perfect solution ! Listen to the robot ! I love cooking , and he needs help , right ? - No question . - How about I work to pay off our debt ? I don 't know . I try to hire people who are less unbearable . - Bender 's a model employee ! - He 's so polite ! - And hardworking . - He 's made of candy . Okay , I 'll give it a shot . - All right ! Yeah ! - Hot diggety ! You better keep your nose clean . That 'll be easy . I never wear it . Time for my precious 10 a.m. meeting ! Where is Leela ? I 'm here . And I 'm getting along fine , thanks . My walk took a little longer than usual . Nibbler took me through the zoo . Don 't be embarrassed about needing help . I could do your makeup . I don 't need help . I did this all by myself . You look beautiful ! My favorite artist is Picasso ! I 'm off to the restaurant . Someone can fill in for me . I 'll build someone to fill in for you ! A gamma-powered mechanical monster with freeway on-ramps for arms , and a coal-black heart ! If that guy can 't handle it , let me know . I 'm done siphoning out the grease trap . I need a mint . What job do I move up to ? Pastry chef ? Saucier ? Soup guy ? Bam ! Bam yourself . Who are they ? They 're very good customers , and that 's all I can say . - Are they the Robot Mafia ? - Yes . You call this a table ? You call this a table ? I wouldn 't hit a guy with this ! The Don-Bot don 't like it ! I ought to clamp you ! Calm down , Clamps . The boss likes to put his back against a wall like this there . But that table 's ... Let me bus that for you ! What I meant to do was ... - Oh ! - I can 't believe this ! Get out ! I like this guy 's lack of style . I give the guy cement shoes which he likes better than his lead ones . You think this computes ? I gave you a hundred . You gave me a fifty . - No , I didn 't . - You did . You stealing from him ? I 'm trying , but it 's not easy . Check out his ball bearings . Here 's something for you . - It 's money . - Wow , thanks . You earned that fifty . - It 's a twenty . - It is ? Oh , I 'm sorry , I meant to ... Wait a minute ! Say , you wanna work for me as a hired goon ? I 've always wanted to be a goon ! Hey , Elzar ! I quit ! Okay ! We 're gonna start with a delivery . It 's for a private lottery we run . Wow ! You guys run numbers ? Ones and zeroes mostly . Take this disk to Sammy " The Mechanical Bull " Gravano . Watch out for cops . That 's what my mom said . That 's good oil-aide , son . We could use you in the Robot Mafia . Which I 'm sort of in . You flatter me , kind goon . I 'm programmed to only sell oil-aide and write cute backwards letters . Oh , crap . The cops ! - See anything suspicious ? - Nope . But check out today 's " Marmaduke . " Solid . Hey , it 's that skell from Elzar 's ! Undercover pursuit in progress ... baby . - Gotcha ! - What 's the problem ? - Was I speeding ? - We 'll decide that after a search . He 's clean . Smells nice too . - Better than me ? - Oh , yeah . Courtesy of Mr. Bender . Nice job . You passed the test . You want to join us at our social club tomorrow night ? I 'd rather plan some felonies . Then we should meet at our headquarters . Don-Bot , please . I can 't make the loan payment . Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file . File not found . That 's a warning . Thank you , Don-Bot . Joey . Clamps . Donny-B . We got a big score planned , but we need some muscle . A little of this , huh ? This guy 's got the strength of an ox . He needs a nickname ! How about Clamps ? That 's my name , you numbskull ! Don 't make me clamp you one ! How 's Blotto ? It 's gritty , and I can keep my monogrammed slippers . Good thinking ! Hey ! This score ain 't gonna be easy . There may be some death killing . It 'll be clamp this , clamp that , ba-da-clamp ! Well , Blotto ? You in ? It 's funny . I always wanted to be a gangster . The answer is yes ! - Yeah ! - Way to go ! Way to be ! Way to shoot ! Since we 'll be committing crimes you 'll want an alibi . An alibi , huh ? I don 't feel good . I 'm genuinely sick . We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes ! I can 't move . Oh , I think I 'm gonna output . You stay in bed . I 'll eat yours . Bender 's sick . Need any help taking off ? I 'm fine . A real pilot can navigate by feel alone . That 's coming out of your pay ! The secret of robot cooking : Start with a high-quality oil . Then eat it . So , what 's this big score ? Heisting Zuban cigars . Those are the best cigars in the universe ! I can stink up a hospital with one of those ! There he is . Let 's shoot bullets at him . Here 's the battle plan . We shoot , they surrender we get the cigars and go home . All without any killing . You 've got some fresh new ideas ! I admire that . - We 'll kill them . - We got them out-clamped . They won 't know what clamped them ! Too bad you can 't see because there 's a ship shooting at somebody . I 'm taking evasive action ! - Uh , Leela ? - Stop bothering me ! I need full concentration ! - Missile evaded . - Eyes are for chumps . Their desire to live shows me no respect . Roll down a window and start shooting . Oh , he got me ! What a shot that guy is ! Wait , the letters that normally say " Master Steering Wheel Co . " say " Nibbler . " Oh , no ! I 'm back at the Wheel , Fry . Great . The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance ! They 're coming this way ! You should clamp them ! Gee , you think ? Think I should use these clamps that I use every day , at every opportunity ? You 're a genius , you idiot ! The engine 's stalled ! I 'm trying the manual fuel pump ! Hello . We 're the Robot Mafia . The entire Robot Mafia . We 're taking the cigars . - You can 't ! - Unless you let us live ! Then you 'll get off . Blindfold them before they see us some more . Boss , somebody beat us to it . That 's a joke at my expense . Well , who 's laughing now ? Where 's Blotto ? He should be here , learning the trade . Sorry I 'm tardy , old bean . I was enjoying a watercress sandwich . He 's classier than I thought . Tie them up ! Capital idea ! I say , get the hell off me ! He sounds familiar . My word , what have we ... ? Nothing to see here ! Hey , boss . This crew list lists a robot . Okay . I want you to find him and plug him . Then unplug him . - No ! - I got a surprise for that guy : The clamps ! Wait , Old Spice . Let me get this chap ! I can be quite rough . Poor Bender . Oh , I don 't feel good . Chew on this ! What ho ! Stop it ! Take that , you twit ! No , stop it ! That 's the last of them . Now let 's mafia things up . Joey , burn the ship . Clamps , burn the crew . Donny , give me a chance here , huh ? Let me take care of the dirty work . Hey , I like your attitude . And your accent . Keep it up and I might get you your own pair of clamps . He 's gonna get clamps ? Clamps ! Clamps , clamps , clamps . We may not have much time so let 's spend all of it talking about Bender . He was like a computer that ran on magic . Help ! Help ! - Bender ! - You 're okay ! Yes , I am ! Having just regained consciousness ! I 've got an idea . It 's about to break ! Yes ! - All right ! - It broke all right ! Leela was in command , and when she kicked , it hurt . It really hurt . This is the big moment . I can take my patch off . I 'll do the snipping . After all , I do have the proper equipment . It 's Blotto ! That gangster I saw ! Professor ? Where were you last night ? Where am I now ? They sent a child to kill me ! I 'm not going without a fight ! Fine kick , sir . But I 'm here to deliver your cut from the heist . Oh , sweet legal tender ! Tell the Don-Bot I quit organized crime . I 'll stick to the regular kind . It 's funny . With you sick and Leela blind only I know what went on . Maybe someday I 'll tell . And maybe someday I won 't listen . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

 We have been hidden for decades . How could they have found the abbey now ? You 're safe , that 's all that matters . We must hide in the mountains now and complete your training . I 'm ready now . Davos , what is it ? Nothing ... let 's keep moving . Goth 's are relentless ... lest they pick up our trail . But what about the others ? Those that survive will find us . Those that did not ... well , we must make sure that they did not die in vain . I will not fail Davos . We 've been hunting for two days and haven 't seen a single boar yet . Maybe they all headed south for the winter . Anyone ever tell you patience is a virtue ? We 'll find something soon . Not quite what I had in mind . - Gideon run ! - Davos ! Gideon at last . At the abbey you killed them all . - Looking for you . - Congratulations ... - you found me . - Take him ! Move away from the boy , slowly . I wouldn 't . Drop your weapons ... and keep moving . This isn 't over . You must be ready after all . No ! You can 't , you can 't die . Well it wouldn 't be my first choice . No ! You must protect him . Take him to the elders , promise me . You must save the ' Star of Hope ' . At the dawn of the century A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World You were more than my teacher Davos , you were my friend . Rest well . Who were those men ? Goths , a generation ago they descended upon my people . They destroyed our civilization , forced us into hiding . It seems they found you , about this ' Star of Hope ' . It 's a symbol a call to arms , one we 've vowed to die for . It 's just a stone my friend it 's not worth someone 's life . It 's worth mine . Only the ' Star of Hope' can unite the Moya . Without it we have no chance of defeating the Goths . That explains your welcoming committee . - Where 's the rest of you people ? - Hidden waiting for this . Fascinating , we 'd love to stay and chat but tempus fugit . - How will you find them ? - I 'm the Chosen One , I 'll know the way . The jungle is no place for hide and seek , and traveling alone . All you 'll find is death . Oh no no no , Roxton ? You have your woman to protect . Protect me ! You think he protects me ? I can 't ask you to come with me . You don 't have to , Davos already did . Then we must move quickly . The Goths will be back . Let 's go . What just happened ? - He needs our help . - No , not to hear him tell it . Look you 're the one that said the staff wasn 't worth people 's lives . Now you 're risking ours . - We can 't let him go alone . - He 's not our responsibility . He 's just a kid . Yeah a kid determined to wage war . Now is not the time to get paternal . You don 't even know if he 's telling the truth . - I trust him . - Why ? I 'm going with or without you . You 're worried about leaving him alone but me you 're willing to abandon . Men ! Very nice . The wood I mean . Feel free to take a turn . But you do it so well . I do a lot of things well . Close your eyes . - Excuse me ? - I have a surprise for you . Really ? Now put out your hands . - Ned ? - Come on . - Now what ? Hey ! - Surprise ! You don 't expect me to carry it all ? - But you do it so well . - Malone I swear ... now that was a surprise . I must be getting jumpy in my old age . I 'm Kaya . The kid 's never left the abbey ... you want to tell me how he knows where he 's going ? It 's his training . Ah yes , of course he can smell his way home . - Keep up ! - You heard the man . Marguerite . Gideon . - Gideon ! - Oh great . Marguerite . Whoa . What the hell were you doing ? A warrior never turns from his enemies . If you 'd have let them pass they wouldn 't have been our enemies . - Well it 's a matter of honor . - You almost got me killed ! Well , I wouldn 't expect a woman to understand . - Why you arrogant little ... - Marguerite . Listen up little boy ... I 'm sure at the abbey you were God 's gift to mankind . But here in the jungle we have a rule . Don 't ask for trouble or you 're likely to find it . If you want to keep that kid alive keep him away from me . It was within my grasp ! Bring me a list of the dead and injured from the mornings attack on the abbey . And bring wine ! Something from the Monk 's cellar I think . The Moya making fools of you ; bested by a child and an old man . - Enough ! - You had them . Do not test me Lucas . I 've killed many men today , one death more or less . Kill me and you 'll never find the ' Star of Hope ' . - You look lovely . - Thank you . Marguerite and Roxton aren 't back yet shouldn 't we be doing this tomorrow ? It won 't be Ned 's birthday tomorrow . It 's been eleven years since I 've has a party in this house . And I 'm not going to miss this one . Here he is . Surprise ! You don 't know the half of it . Everybody meet Kaya . Gideon , consider the consequences . Be reasonable about this please . I don 't need your help ; I 'll find my own way . Gideon ! Hey ! Don 't you walk away from me ! I did not ask you to come with me ! No , the man we buried did . We can 't deliver the staff rock if your dead can we ? I have spent my whole life preparing for this journey . I can 't fail . No ! Won 't fail , that determination . Can 't fail ... that 's arrogance , that 's death . Don 't turn around go back the way you came . Go . Go . Stop ! Lucas ? - Brother ! - Brother ? They captured three of us Miguel , Jacob and me . I managed to overpower one of the guards and grabbed his clothes . - And the others ? - Gone . As a strategy ... you could do better then swing first ask questions later . Yes well perhaps it 's a family trait ? Sorry , I saw you grab Gideon and I thought ... he was your prisoner . See all 's well that ends well . Now you two have found each other I guess we can head back . It will be dark soon ; we should camp here . Camp ? Camp ? No we should keep going . No the jungle is no place to travel by night . You 'll do your people no good in a raptor 's belly . Lucas perhaps you should give Gideon a hand with the fire . Come on . Just one question who made you their father ? So you 've been walking through the jungle alone for six months . Six months all by yourself . That 's incredible . Six months try eleven years . It 's been weeks since I 've spoken to another human being . Oh you poor thing . It 's lucky I found one with such a noble heart . And you have no weapons ; how do you survive ? Well I stay out of trouble . You know most things just want the same things I want ... that 's to live . And what if a raptors life includes having you for breakfast ? Well then we have a problem . You look remarkably healthy and well nourished . Do you mind if I take your pulse ? Summerlee you 're frightening her . That 's odd . George check her pulse . She 's fine . - No you don 't understand . - Professor ... - she 's a guest not a guinea pig . - No ! of course she 's not . Yes but if you just allow me a moment ... Leave her alone . Imagine thinking that your brother was dead then finding out he wasn 't . I wonder what that feels like . I 'll never know . Come on admit it that kid reminds you of someone . - That 's not why I 'm here Marguerite . - Could have fooled me . They 're boys we can 't abandon them . No of course not it 's not what a warrior does . He 's honest , forthright . arrogant . Maybe he reminds me of someone . It was a lovely party . Though , personally I always find the surprise element a little unsettling especially if there 's one too many surprises . - I 'm fine . - Now I didn 't say you weren 't . What do you think of her ? Kaya ? She 's friendly enough , very pretty . Seems to be unanimous , but there 's something about her . Oh Veronica she 's just happy to be among friends again she been through quite an ordeal . I 've survived eleven years , on my own , by trusting my instincts . And your instincts tell you there 's something is wrong with Kaya , or is it with Malone ? Veronica it 's getting late we should go up . You go on . I 'll be ok ... or not . Let 's get back to the treehouse . A knife and a pistol . Not the best weapons to pierce that thick hide I agree . I 'm open for suggestions . Summerlee ! Malone ! - Wake up Malone ! - Summerlee ! - Malone ! - Malone ! Trouble now ! Summerlee ! Malone ! Where the hell are they ? Summerlee ! - Nice shooting . - Thanks guys . Excuse me chosen boy I don 't suppose you could smell us out an easier route ? I 'm just curious at what point do we actually admit were lost ? - We 're close . - You said that an hour ago . So ? Now we 're an hour closer . It 's a dead end . - When I 'm right ; I 'm right . - Gideon . Quiet ! I 'm listening . Hmm. well maybe we took a wrong turn . You bet we did . This way . Oh ye of little faith . At last , your mine . We owe you a dept of gratitude . It was our pleasure . You have returned the 'Star of Hope ' to my people . This is a symbol that will lead our people to freedom . Rise , my son . Phelan I don 't believe he knows . - Knows what exactly ? - Did Davos not tell you ? The abbey was destroyed ... my training was not complete . Of course . That does not matter ; I 've brought you the ' Star of Hope ' . Yes son , you did . You are the ' Star of Hope ' . - Me ? - Him ? You are the Chosen One . All your life you have been trained to unite and lead the ... Moya out of the darkness ... and back into the light . Lead ? Me ? Look ! Come , there is another way . We should go in after them . They 'd be fools not to have another way out . Oh I 'm counting on it . More green wood ! We need more smoke . Cyan we 'll loose them this mountain is a honey comb of caves . Idiot , just look for where the smoke comes out . They may travel fast but the smoke will travel faster ... and we 'll be waiting for them . It 's getting worse . Maybe it was a forest fire outside the cave . That can 't be the door 's been shut behind us . I know who did it . The Goths . Oh no out of the frying pan into the fire . - I led them straight to you . - Look ! There 's the way out . Now let 's just think about this . We don 't know what 's out there . Maybe not but we know what 's behind us . Gideon 's right . The Goth 's know nothing of the caves . If we move quickly we 'll be safe . - Almost there - I 'll be all right . Help Lor . You 're the Chosen One brother I 've got him . Gideon let me go first I 'll scout ahead . - We can 't wait . - Damn it Gideon . Come on back , back ! You idiots what good are they dead ! Bring them out ; the strangers you can kill ! But I want the rest of them alive ! We won 't be able to hold them off forever . Buy me a minute . Are you out of your mind ? There 's a current , I felt an opening in the rock where the water falls through . - Big enough for us ? - Just . Just ? What if it narrows half way down , we 'll drown . - It 's our best shot . - It 's suicide . - I say we surrender . - No ! They 'll kill us . I could use a swim . Come on ! Take a deep breath and follow me . What is it ? I 'm very fond of Veronica and I wouldn 't want to see her get hurt . So ? I 'm sure you wouldn 't either . If you have something to say , say it . There are certain things a gentleman does ... and certain things a gentleman does not do . You stepped over the line last night with Kaya . Veronica doesn 't deserve this ; she trusts you . It 's none of your business . This is her home . I said it 's none of your business . - Mr. Malone ! - Back off ! Do I make myself clear ? We made it ! Is everyone all right ? You did it . You saved us . We got lucky . Malone ! Ned ? Ned ? Didn 't you hear me ? Veronica ? Come with me back to the treehouse . I can 't ... Kaya needs me . What 's going on ? What 's happened to you ? I have to go . We should get moving ; It won 't take them long to figure out where we went . You don 't have to ask me twice . - Gideon ? - They 're dead ... because of me . But you 're still alive . What , my life matters more then theirs ? Excuse me , Goth 's crossbows . Am I the only one who thinks we should be disappearing ? Marguerite 's right , there 's no time for doubts . Gideon ... as a small boy you were chosen to lead us to victory . How can I ? A lifetime of training and I nearly get you all killed . But you didn 't , Gideon . Without you the Moya are just three tribes ... as intent on fighting each other as they are the Goths . Only the chosen one can unite us . Well you chose wrong . I will not lead you to your death . I was my brother 's companion all my life his training was my training . I can lead our people . You were not chosen . Right now I 'm the only choice you have . Let 's go . Coming your Lordship ? I 'll catch up . Clearly whatever 's infecting Kaya has got into Malone as well . So it 's a disease ? Probably more likely a parasite living off the host 's body . It seems to weave around the spine rather like a vine around a tree trunk . Yes much like the strangler fig . - Which ultimately kills its host . - Are you saying Kaya is killing him ? Kaya , or whatever she is now . When I felt for her pulse , she had none . No pulse as in dead ? Now let 's not jump to conclusions . We have no evidence that 's it 's actually hurting him . I have all I need . Hold up ! Hold up ! We 're circling back . No we 're not . Look I may not have a jeweled staff but I have a great sense of direction . We 're headed back toward the caves . Come on close your eyes , taste the wind , whatever ... Can 't you feel the right way ? - I 'll only lead you to another ambush . - No . that 's your brother 's job . What are you doing ; I 'm to blame . That 's just what he wants you to think . Search him . - For what ? - He 's been marking the trail . You didn 't lead the Goths to your people Gideon , Lucas did . Don 't be ridiculous , they 're in this together . She planted that powder . Warriors don 't surrender . So why were you so quick to give up at the cave ? - We were cornered . - You knew they were out there . That 's why you stayed back while Gideon led the others out . - You sent them out to die . - You 're wrong . You betrayed the abbey too didn 't you ? You weren 't the Goths prisoner you were their secret weapon . How else could you escape without a mark on you ? Gideon . - Lucas . - It 's not true . - Drop your weapon . - No . - Shoot him . - And risk killing the Chosen One ? - Lucas you 're my brother . - Your older brother . I should have been chosen . Drop it or he dies . - Shoot through me . - What ? Kill me , kill him . It 's the only way to save my people . No . Roxton just take a shot you can do this . Can you ; are you sure ? Shoot ! This is between us brother . Next time . You should have killed him ! He couldn 't , not again . They 'll be on us we must run . No , I 'm done running . The Goths are right out there . They 'll be on us in a day . Our only chance is to bring the fight to them . We won 't win there 's too many of them . I thought a warrior never turns from his enemies . I 'm not . Phelan and I know where our people are hidden . We cannot be taken alive . Look people betray you that 's the way life is . It happens all the time . you don 't kill yourself over it . Gideon is right . If we are taken ... no one can withstand torture indefinitely . - Dying is not an option . - No ... it 's inevitable . You play martyr ... and the Goths get stronger . In another generation a new Chosen One will rise up . People are dead because they believed in you ... I believed in you . And you better believe I 'll kick your sorry ass ... across this jungle before I let you kill yourself . - You think I want to die ? - Yes . because right now that 's easier than living . I know how that feels Gideon . There 's a big difference between honor and guilt . Let 's go . Can I ask where ? They want to play capture the leader let 's give them a game to remember . I knew you 'd come . I can 't do this . You can 't do anything else . Life must continue ... this is why we exist , to continue to exist . But Veronica . I understand your feelings but we are Adam and Eve . We must finish this journey . It must happen now , please . But I love her . I know . But I 've done everything you 've asked of me . - Except bring me your brother . - I still can . Traitor . She survived the attack . We were able to ... persuade her to tell us were the rebels are hiding . So thankfully I don 't need you anymore . Cut his head off slowly . Wait ! I can be the Chosen One . I can deliver the rebels to you without a fight . What makes you think you were chosen to ... be anything more than food for worms ? I have this . The Moya have never seen Gideon . With this I am the ' Star of Hope ' . Interesting , you do think well under pressure . Thanks to you life continues . Get away from him . Wait ! Don 't do this . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Yes I do ! She 's infected you ! The being inside him has returned to me . He 's safe now , free . And I 'll make sure he stays that way . Let go of me . Listen to me would you kill a woman for wanting a child . - What ? - Goodbye Ned . She was the last of a dying race ... she needed a human host to procreate . She took a dying female Kaya she needed a ... A man . Veronica ... since the day I met you . Don 't , not now . Veronica ? Walk you home ? Don 't fire unless it 's an emergency . You ready ? Hey ! Kill them ! Kill them all ! It seemed like an emergency to me . Didn 't I teach you to never let down you guard ... especially around me . Gideon please ... I 'm your brother . Call your men off now . Last chance ; call them off or die . Lay down your weapons . That 's right drop ' em ... and take a walk into the jungle , a long walk . I believe this is yours . Gideon ? - I killed my brother . - We had no choice . I 've only had one real battle and already I 'm sick of death . How can I lead my people to war ? Maybe the best war is the one you don 't have to fight . You have Cyan ... - negotiate a peace with the Goths . - Negotiate ? I was trained to be a warrior ... not a diplomat . It 's your call . Is that what you would do ? Gideon it 's time . I 'll never forget you . Go on . Hmm the boy 's done us proud . They grow up so fast these days . How motherly of you , I wouldn 't have thought there was a maternal bone in your body . How little you know me . On the other hand why would I need children ... . when I have you ?

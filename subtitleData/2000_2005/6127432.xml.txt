 All units stand by . Squadron moves out in 30 minutes . All right , men . Let 's go . All units , stand by . I repeat . All units , stand by . Large tropical storm has formed south of the Ryoko Islands and is moving north at 25 miles per hour . Everything 's in order , sir . Move out , now . Move out ! - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . - Let 's go . - Roger . It 's coming right at us . Typhoon 13 is a very large storm . It 's moving due north and continues to gain strength . The storm 's rapidly approaching the Boso Peninsula . We 're getting battered here in Tateyama . It 's pouring with rain and the wind is exceptionally strong . It 's getting very difficult just to stand ... Here 's the latest from Weather Central . The pressure in the eye of the typhoon is currently reading ... 959 millibars and falling . The wind speed is reading almost 90 ... Almost 90 miles an hour , and it 's gusting over 110 . It 's huge and getting bigger by the minute . Huh ? Get me out of here ! God damn it ! Attention , all units . The gigantic creature was sighted in Tateyama , Chiba Prefecture . Continue moving northward and attack immediately on sighting the creature . This is aviation search unit 1 . Aviation units 3 , 6 , 7 , standby until evacuation is complete . Convoy number 1 and 21 continue lookout until further notice . We don 't have any backup ! This way , hurry ! That 's my house ! An emergency evacuation has been ordered for all citizens . All units rendezvous at Route 89 immediately . Concentrate your fire power on the creature 's torso . It must be stopped at all cost . Can you see the target ? I 'm locked on . Fire ! Fall back ! Fall back , now ! US Navy defense squadron is moving forward to render assistance . Maser tank unit 3 and 4 in position . Roger , units 3 and 4 . Prepare to move in . Maser tank unit 2 , standing by . Okay , okay . Stop . - Hit the lights . - Sir ! Target located ! Target located ! Activate maser . Maser activating . My God . Hold it steady . Elevate turret . Raising turret . Link up targeting system . Targeting system linked up , go . Fire maser . Firing maser . The rain 's reduced its power by 70 % . Fall back . After the horrors of last night , this morning , Tateyama 's waking up to another nightmare . The damage is appalling . The city is in ruins and its citizens are devastated . The army is leading the rescue effort but the death toll is sure to be high . In Tokyo , Prime Minister Tsug√© has confirmed the field reports . This attack was carried out by another Godzilla monster , similar to the killer of 1954 . Godzilla . After its frenzied rampage through Tateyama , this latest Godzilla waded back into the Pacific Ocean . The authorities cannot rule out that it is lying in wait nearby , waiting to strike these people again . Forty-five years after the first Godzilla attack , our country is under threat once more . Will our government turn and run or will they stand and fight ? We 've been struck by another disaster . Forty-five years ago , the first Godzilla creature laid waste to Tokyo . It was killed with a secret weapon invented by Dr. Serizawa . But it can never be used again . Dr. Serizawa was afraid of the terrible power he 'd unleashed , and he refused to reveal its secret . He took it to the grave with him . Godzilla put a curse on Japan . Ever since it first appeared , it seems we keep being invaded by giant monsters . Like Mothra , that giant moth spawned by atomic tests in the South Pacific . Luckily , we destroyed it with a massive heat-ray gun . Or Bigfoot Gaira , that attack was foiled after the government fought back and destroyed it with a maser-equipped battle group . With each attack , Tokyo suffered terrible destruction . Thankfully , the citizens have always helped us rebuild . But now Godzilla 's back . And we have no way of defending ourselves . It could decide to destroy every one of our cities and there 's nothing we could do to stop it . You understand we 're not blaming you here . You 're not responsible for their deaths . Unless those deaths were caused intentionally by you . All we want to know is how this happened . Just how could it be that a brilliant young maser-operator like yourself overlooked a model 73 compact vehicle ? Did you panic in terror ? I will face any consequences of my actions . Did you hear about Akane Yashiro ? Now they 've transferred her to a deskjob . Well , Minister , it seems we 've got a problem here . Godzilla is unique . It 's immune to maser fire . I agree . This certainly seems to be the case . For now . But it won 't happen again . Ever . We won 't let the sacrifices of our men go to waste . It looks like a monster . What is it ? Come on . You know what it is . Look again . They became extinct 245 million years ago . It 's a trilobite . It 's a robot ? Well , half-robot . It 's a robotic exoskeleton . Inside , the muscles and nerves of a horseshoe crab . The brain ? A tiny DNA computer so it moves as if it were alive . It 's my way of conserving them . Every species needs a hand . Especially now . Humans are ruining the Earth , destroying ecosystems by the dozen . I will reverse this tide . Nobody 's listening . Dr. Yuhara . - Yeah ? - We 're with the government . Could you please come with us ? It 's quite an urgent matter . They 're all here , sir . Gathered around this table are the finest scientific minds in Japan . In fact , you scientists are the brain of this country . I have something to show you . Something quite shocking . Yes , that 's right . Godzilla . What you 're looking at is the skeleton of the 1954 Godzilla . Last year , we salvaged it from the Pacific . Dr. Yuhara , what do you think ? Can you recover an interspinal cell ? It won 't be easy . - Hold on . You want to clone it ? - Not quite . We want to make something like Godzilla . It 's called a bio-robot . You 're familiar with those , I hear . We want to build a powerful super weapon to fight Godzilla . Our bio-mechanical Godzilla will be even more powerful than the real thing . That 's why you 're here . All of you , Japan needs you . People , the nation 's fate is in your hands . The emergency bill on development of the anti-Godzilla super weapon is officially passed . - Where 's the money coming from ? - One question , please ! - Who 's paying for all this ? - How much will it cost ? This is a national emergency , people . We 'll find the money . If we use it on Godzilla , we might use it on other countries . Prime Minister , is this an attempt to re-arm Japan with weapons of mass destruction ? No , it most certainly is not . I contacted world leaders . I 've explained to them the threat that we 're facing . Japan 's been savaged by Godzilla on two occasions . The world 's seen the evidence . They know how the victims suffered . I 'll meet with any leader who 's still skeptical . How do you like the job so far ? Not exactly a high-stress affair , is it ? I 'm sure you 'll find it most relaxing . I assure you we 're trying our best to build the weapon . It 'll rid our country of Godzilla once and for all . Good morning . - Sara , it 's ready . - Coming ! The level of support we 've seen for this bill is unprecedented . Almost 77 % of the National Diet voted in favor of the anti-Godzilla super weapon . There are those who claim that the governemnt has rushed the bill through but considering the overwhelming public support , - Right . Let 's eat . - Let 's eat . Thanks , Daddy . it seems that concerns like these aren 't high on the agenda . Well , Doctor , what 's your opinion on this ? Political Commentator Yasushi Nishizawa Well , it 's pretty obvious , isn 't it ? People are terrified . Godzilla 's got everybody scared . But do you think that with this rush to legalize the bill ... Daddy . Are you gonna take the job ? ... some legitimate concerns are being pushed aside ? No way . - Why not ? - I told you why . I have to stay and keep you company . Look , you 're the most important thing in my life , Sara . You need me . I can 't just take a job and leave you . Don 't say that . It 's not fair . You 're gonna make me feel bad . Hey ! Baseball stars ! We 'll do it like they do . You know . The player keeps his kid in the dugout with him . They do it all the time . Isn 't that a good idea ? Sara , baseball 's one thing , my job 's a lot different . Now , eat your veggies . I don 't want you getting scurvy . What about you ? I 'm completely immune to scurvy . I wonder who that could be . Come on . Eat up , girl , or we 'll be late . Doctor , please reconsider your decision . I already said no . Didn 't you hear me ? We did . You made your views clear , but here 's a new proposal . What if we let your daughter come to work with you , like baseball players ' children who can enter the dugout . Might that be something that would help change your mind ? She 's only a month old . Take good care of her , okay ? Hey , Yuhara . You live around here , don 't you ? She 's new around here . How 's that any of your business ? See that place ? They 're making a robot . Yeah , and it 's gonna kick Godzilla 's butt . Oh , yeah ? And what do they call it ? It 's a Godzilla robot . It 's called MechaGodzilla . MechaGodzilla ? - Cool ! - Cool . This is where I live . Bye , guys . I 'm home . Welcome home . Amazing . Just look at them . The spinal cells , they 've begun to divide . This is a great day for the project , Doctor , and a really great day for us all . - Well done . - Thank you . - Well done . - We did it ! - Congratulations . - Fantastic . Why Godzilla ? Why not Mom ? I wish they 'd bring her back to life instead . - Here , honey . - He 's so cute . - Eat it , eat it . Come on . - So cute . Remember , this country 's going to need strong leadership . Can you lead them into battle ? Yes . Prepare to open supply hatch 23 . All personnel , stand clear . Supply hatch 23 opening now . - Right away . - Thank you . Yes , we 're checking that now . All personnel , stand clear . Crane seven is preparing to lift . It 's been awhile . Listen . I 'm leading the Kiryu squad . Kiryu ? That 's what they 've called it . We 're in charge of the weapon . MechaGodzilla . We 've got the best . Both pilots and crew . I 've put your name on the list , too . I want you back . Please join us . Kiryu squad ! Halt ! Right face ! Salute ! At ease . Kiryu squadron , led by Colonel Togashi . We 're ready and reporting for duty . What is this , some kind of joke ? What the hell are you doing here ? Four years ago , my brother died because of your mistake . Stop it . You better watch your backs , guys . She might screw up again , and then it 'll be you in the body bag . Hayama ! What 's going on ? You got a problem ? You may be a pretty good pilot , but if you mess with my team , I 'll throw you off it double quick . That goes for everybody . - Come on . Let 's go . - Yeah . Can I help you , ma 'am ? Hey . A touch-me-not . It moves when you touch it , right ? - Coffee . - Sure . - Here you go , ma 'am . - Thanks . I 'll have the same as her . Hi . Too obvious . Butt out . Mind if I sit down ? Akane . Sorry . Ms. Yashiro . So , do you like children ? Oh , boy . Me and my big mouth . Well , congratulations . I hear you 're piloting Kiryu . That means they think you 're the best pilot in the whole squad . What a sick joke that is . You 'll probably end up killing us all . And who 's this guy ? A new admirer of yours ? How much did you have to pay him , huh ? Enough of that ! Beat it , old man . Hayama . You need to learn some manners . I see . Makes sense . That 's why he 's so hostile to you . I thought there was something different about you . I felt a wall between you and the others . Must be hard being alone . So , have you had it for long ? - It 's like her baby . - Daddy ! Sorry . I had a plant when I was young . It was my only friend . No friends and no family . Some things never change . And now , I 'm used to it . It doesn 't bother me anymore . All right ! Let 's make a deal . If MechaGodzilla ... My mistake . If Kiryu beats Godzilla , then I 'm going to buy you dinner to celebrate . But then , if Kiryu ends up beaten by Godzilla , then its creator owes you an apology . So then , I guess , I 'll have to buy you dinner . What do you say , huh ? I liked my little plant , but I kept it too long . Don 't make the same mistake that I did . Welcome . I 'd like to announce that the anti-Godzilla weapon is ready . Soon , our country will be impregnable . The government would like to extend its heartfelt thanks to all those involved in making this massive project a reality . And we hope you share our pride as we present this great achievement to the world . Congratulations , we 've done it ! The chief scientists involved will now explain the machine 's structure and performance . Good afternoon . The robot 's form is based on Godzilla 's body . Kiryu 's robotics are the most advanced the world has ever seen . It has been designed to withstand every conceivable combat situation . Now , about the CPU , it is powered by DNA computers . With ordinary computers , the binary system is used . But DNA ones use Base 4 , and are the fastest computers that exist today . Kiryu can be programmed for specific battle operations , but at any point those parameters can be changed instantaneously by remote control from the AC-3 transport craft . Captain ! What the heck is that ? A whale ? No , too big . This is AMF HQ . We 're tracking a very large animal in the Pacific . Scramble all aircraft . Intercept immediately . Kiryu can be in a combat situation for two hours . If we need it to fight any longer , the machine can be remotely recharged using an aircraft implanted with microwave energy launched from the nearest Air Force base . Its main weapon is a powerful gun . Observe . It 's called the Absolute Zero gun and it 's extremely effective . Please watch the screen . We held our first live fire test of the weapon late last week . Basically , it emits an intense low temperature ray which freezes the target to absolute zero or - 273 degrees . This allows destruction of the target at a molecular level . The extent of Kiryu 's power is devoted to the gun . At last we have the ultimate weapon ! There 's something moving down there . There 's no way it 's a ship . With the Absolute Zero weapon , in addition to its huge arsenal of more conventional weapons , Kiryu is an invincible fighting machine . What ? Godzilla ? Yes , sir , he 's headed due north , straight for Tokyo . Get the joint chiefs , immediately . Prepare Kiryu . Sir . Kiryu squadron , we have a code red . This is not a drill . We are on red alert . You are now under the direct orders of the AMF chief of staff . Kiryu squadron , prepare for departure . This is not a drill . I repeat , this is not a drill . Godzilla . Godzilla ! Flight Heron crews to your aircraft ! Systems check complete . Flight Herons 1 , 2 and 3 , move to lift off position . Barriers off . The US army 's on the line , sir . Wait here . Flight Herons are ready to go . - Lift off ! - Lift off ! Heron 2 , lifting off . Opening Kiryu bay doors . Commencing lift procedure . Doors are fully open . Ground crew , return to the safe zone immediately . I repeat , ground crew return to the safe zone immediately . Unlock body operating system . Flight Herons 1 , 2 and 3 in position . Lowering transport cables . Commencing lift procedure . - Kiryu has lifted off . - Aircraft are clear . - Balance gyros optimal . - Control , they 're on the way . Godzilla has just entered Tokyo Bay . It is heading directly for the city 's downtown area . Other cities under threat , Yokosuka , Yokohama , also Kawasaki . Please evacuate the area immediately . Eyewitnesses are reporting severe road jams . Evacuees should abandon their vehicles . You 're joking ! Move it ! Get out of the way ! Move it ! Godzilla has been sighted nearby . Evacuate the area immediately . Hey , come here ! Godzilla has been sighted nearby . Evacuate the area immediately . Don 't just stand there . We 've got to get out of here ! All visitors to the Hakkeijima Sea Paradise must leave the park immediately . Please follow the instructions given by military personnel . Take your children directly to the nearest place of safety . We 've just sighted Godzilla ! Fall back ! Back ! Fall back now ! Confirm evacuation status . All units in the area , stand by . Activating Kiryu model 3 . Ready to attack . Let 's see what Kiryu 's got . - Target sighted . Begin descent . - Roger . Beginning descent . Hakkeijima has been evacuated . Kiryu has landed . All aircraft get out of its field of fire ! All units , stand by . Transport cables fully retracted . Pulling out . White Heron 3 leaving the range . - Commence attack . - Roger . Rockets armed . Firing . Missiles away . - Hit him with the masers . Do it now ! - Roger . Check it out , it 's retreating ! Akane , finish it off ! Absolute Zero , stand by . Locks off . - What 's wrong ? - I 'm not getting a response ! Something 's wrong here . We 're losing control ! - Switch to backup . - This can 't be happening now ! Godzilla 's getting away . Kiryu is no longer responding to commands . Akane , what 's happening down there ? It won 't respond ! - Roger that . Take it back to base . - Roger . Roger . Jesus Christ ! Are you trying to kill us ? Akane , what 's wrong ? Kiryu 's out of control ! - It 's gone berserk . - It 's what ? - It 's acting like Godzilla . - System override not functional . All units remain in place . Stand by for order to attack . Where the hell 's the Kiryu squad ? Control , I 'll try and distract it . It might follow me . - Are you sure ? - Just leave it to me . Damn it , follow me , would you ? Carrier three 's down , sir ! You okay ? Hayama ! Hayama ! Let 's get out of here ! Go ahead ! Get out ! Why 'd you save me ? It 's working fine , it 's just not responding ! Of course , Kiryu thinks we 're the enemy . This is nothing . Wait till it fires its main weapon ! Can 't you stop it ? Do something now ! I 'm sorry , sir . All we can do now is wait till it runs out of power . How long will that take ? Approximately an hour . Not responding to remote shutdown commands . Have you found Godzilla yet ? No , not yet . So far we 've found no trace of it . I see . I 'll take full responsibility . I pushed for Project Kiryu too hard . But you can 't resign , sir . We need Kiryu . What happened was a design flaw . It can be fixed ! - And what about the squadron ? - I really don 't know . You see , Kiryu and Godzilla share the same DNA . So Kiryu might turn against us again . Circular joint okay . Something out there sure made it angry . But what could it be ? Akamatsu , I need your data ! Sure . It happened right after Godzilla 's roar . It was the sound . It triggered something in MechaGodzilla . So , will you be able to fix Kiryu ? Of course . You see , all Kiryu 's computers were put together using the original Godzilla 's DNA . But we can fix that . If we change the base DNA , and then assemble completely new computers , then we 're home free and Godzilla will be finished . Let 's hope so . But we might not even have a chance to use it any more . That 's not true . Kiryu 's all we 've got . Right , just for you , I will give it my all . There goes my mouth again . How 's the head ? That was a close shave . Why did you save me , huh ? So that I 'd owe you my life ? I 'd rather be dead . What 's your problem ? She saved my life as well . So you 're all on her side , are you ? Cut the crap ! We 're fighting Godzilla here . Not Akane . Drop the attitude , would you ? Where did Sara go ? Sara , what are you doing ? Dad ... Kiryu has a life too . Why are we making it fight Godzilla when it just wants to be friends ? It 's not fair . The H-bomb first brought Godzilla here . And now a cyborg brought him . Who 's to blame ? Human beings . I know what you mean . I really do . No , you don 't ! You adults , you tell us all that life is important , but you don 't believe it ! Just look . That poor creature is in pain and you don 't care ! Sara ! She 's been through a lot . When she was four , her mother died in childbirth . She got sick . It was just one of those things . You see , the doctors told us that they could either save her life or the baby . I told the doctor to save my wife 's life . My wife , she wanted the baby to be born more than anything . And then we had Sara , who wanted them both to be alive , of course . Sadly , both of them ended up dying . Ever since then , Sara has been really sensitive about things to do with life and death . Hey , are you talking with your mother again , Sara ? That 's none of your business . You have to stop running away from reality . Move on , even if you 're afraid . Stop it . Just leave me alone . Hey , if you want to survive , you 've got to put up a fight . That 's what I 've had to do . What do you mean ? Fight who ? I 've had to fight everyone . Anyway , Kiryu is alive , you 're right . And it 's a lot like me . Its life is worth nothing at all . What are you talking about ? No , it 's not . Nobody 's gonna miss me when I 'm gone . I should never have been born at all . Stop it ! Life is a precious thing ! Every life is worth something . Every one . Are you sure ? Here 's the latest report . Sonar contact . It 's close . - Godzilla ? - Possibly . It 's moving real fast . Godzilla has been sighted in Tokyo Bay . It 's heading towards Shinagawa . ETA is 0100 hours . All troops take your positions immediately . The evacuation is proceeding according to plan , sir . First armored unit is stationed on Shinagawa Pier . There it is ! Hold your ground ! - Begin attack . - F2 yellow five , commencing attack . Godzilla has landed at Shinagawa . Kiryu overhaul complete . Diagnostics complete . All parameters green . Shinagawa is under sustained attack . All troops fall back to defensive positions . The repairs are complete . It 's ready ! Aren 't you going to scramble the squad ? Not yet . All our other weaponry is useless ! What are we waiting for ? More innocent people to be killed ? Unit 1 has sustained 40 % damage ! Unit 2 moved to front line . Chief of Staff is waiting for you , sir . He 's at the central command post . He 'll brief you there . Very good . And the head of AMF ? In the Kiryu control room , sir . What is it ? Sir , I 'd like permission to launch Kiryu . It 's been fully repaired . It 's completely safe . You 'd better be sure . Togashi , both our futures depend on this . I 'd stake my life on it . - Sir ... - Togashi . Dispatch Kiryu . It 's the only chance we have left . I take full responsibility . Godspeed to you , Colonel . General , the prime minister gave the green light . I heard . That 's good news . - I 'm going with them . - Fine . Systems check complete . All systems green . Gentlemen , launch Kiryu . Initiating Kiryu launch procedure . We are a go for Kiryu launch . You know , Mom , I kind of like her . She reminds me of you . Coming aboard . We are coming to you live from outside Shinagawa hospital . The scene here is one of complete devastation . Godzilla ! Godzilla 's here ! Range , 350 meters . It 's coming right for us . SSM-1 activate . Squadron , be advised , Godzilla is approaching the hospital . Continue evacuation process . We 'd be too late . We 'll have to release Kiryu . - What ? - Is she serious ? Prepare to release . SSM-1 , fire ! SSM-1 , evacuate ! Get back here ! Watch out ! Get down ! What is it ? Something called Kiryu . - Come on . - Get in , quick ! Evacuation of the area complete . - Akane , you 're a go . - Roger . Commencing attack . Give me a damage report ! We 're okay . This is Asugi Base . We 're ready for take-off . You 're clear ! Go ! Back unit away . Releasing now . Now I 'll show you what Kiryu can really do . Come on . Shinagawa and Minato areas are completely evacuated . We did it ! It can 't fight for much longer . Its power cells are running down . The current readings show only 45 % left . We have to finish this quickly ! Roger that . Akane , Absolute Zero . Stand by ! Absolute Zero , standing by . Locks off . Absolute Zero , fire . The buildings are gone ! What are you doing , Akane ? Get up ! I can 't , sir . Kiryu 's not responding ! What ? Sir . The heat ray . It 's damaged Kiryu 's control systems . Get it fixed ! It 's not over yet , guys . There 's a way to operate Kiryu manually , right ? I can get into it through an external hatch . - That 's it ! - Are you kidding ? She 'll die ! That 's not a heat ray , it 's a stream of pure radiation . I 'm going . You can 't stop me . - I 'm not afraid to die . - Negative ! - Wish me luck . - No ! Wait , Akane ! You can 't do this . Stop ! Get back in formation . Be careful . Good luck . I know you can do it . All maser gun units , fire at Godzilla . Draw its attention . Are the energy levels holding ? No , they 're dropping fast . They 're almost down to zero . Call the power company . There must be a way to get power from the city 's power grid . But to get enough , we 'd have to black out the whole of Tokyo ! Let 's try . No question . I 'll call the power company personally . Damn it . MB-3 is working . Suspend the power supply to all areas . - Area 15 and 16 off . - Area 17 and 18 off . There 's no word yet ... Kiryu . - Make sure you decontaminate . - Yes , Dr. Yuhara . It 's on ! But it 's out of power . We 're sending it . Stand by . Microwave , transmit ! Proceeding . Locked on . Radiate . Kiryu , I know you can hear me . You and I are going to get along just fine . Now , let 's have some fun . Okay , Kiryu is on ! Akane , look out ! Don 't die ! You can 't die ! Kiryu ! Power ! Give me power ! Damage report ? I need a damage report . Come in ! Answer me ! Kiryu is up . Thank God . Oh , no . Not this time . Godzilla ! Akane ! Godzilla can 't use its heat ray right now ! Fire Absolute Zero ! Don 't worry about me . Fire now ! Hayama ! Come on , now ! Godzilla has resurfaced . No sign of Kiryu . Come in , control , the Absolute-Zero is damaged . Power cells depleted . Unable to follow Godzilla . Well done ! You did great , Akane Yashiro . Send a rescue unit to Kiryu . Akane , we 're coming to get you . Kiryu has sustained 37 % damage . Well , we couldn 't destroy it . But we did manage to drive Godzilla away . Yes , we did . We have a weapon more powerful than Godzilla . That means a lot . We had to sacrifice a lot to get here . But this , this is a great victory ! Thank you . Hishinuma , great job . Sara ? It 's nothing . Repair crew report to deck one immediately . I repeat . Repair crew report to deck one . Thank you . For what ? For giving me the strength I needed . And that goes for you as well . " Every life is worth something . " I know what you meant by that now . Where 's the plant ? Oh , yeah . Remember our bet ? I have to buy you dinner . To celebrate your victory . No , I didn 't win . We 'll call it a draw . You know what that means . I have to buy the two of you dinner sometime . I 'm in !

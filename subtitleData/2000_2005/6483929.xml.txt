 - Vodka rocks , please . - Right . Hi . How are you ? Thirsty . Uh , straight up , and no ice this time . I tell this guy about the ice , and then he pours me a Scotch rocks . " About the ice " ? The water actually in the ice . - I 'm kind of an expert on it . - What 's wrong with it ? No big secret . It 's been in the news . Government additive , something they call chloramine . They said it 's good for us . It 's like fluoride . That 's what they say . Look , I didn 't sit down here to scare you . On the contrary . Would you like to get some air ? Long way to go for a drink , huh ? You like living out here ? How much farther ? Just over the bridge . What the hell are you doing ? Let go ! You 're gonna kill us ! Last season : There was a rumoured programme out of the Cold War , a plan to create a super-soldier . Said Scully was in the programme too . - Your baby was a miracle . - My baby is normal . She may never make it out of this building . Get him off ! - This is my baby ! Don 't let them take it ! - Push , Dana . This office is under investigation for a meeting between you and an intelligence operative named Knowle Rohrer . - You investigate what I tell you . - You put me on the X-Files . I think what we feared were the possibilities . The truth , we both know . OK , William . It 's all right . It 's gonna be OK . - Hello ? - Monica , it 's me . Did I wake you ? Brad ? No . No , I 'm awake . You 're in town . Yeah . I came in on short notice . If you 're coming to the Hoover Building , can you stop by my office on your way in ? Yeah . Sure . I can do that . Good . Looking forward to it . .. death of a government employee last night . The body of Carl Wormus , a deputy administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency , was pulled from the Potomac by divers this morning . It appears Wormus drove his car ... A police spokesperson says it appears he was alone ... - Monica ? - Hi . - What are you doing ? - I was leaving you a note . Your assistant was out and I didn 't wanna knock . I was gonna call you . Hi , Brad . Come on in . What ? We 're at work . You used to ask me to close the door at work back in New York . Is that all you called me here for , Assistant Director ? I probably shouldn 't tell you how hot you look either . Cos you do . How long as it been ? Two years ? Yeah . We should catch up , Brad , really . I 've gotta get downstairs . I 've got something for you . Forgive me , but ... it didn 't take a whole lot of digging to figure out why you 're here in DC . What are those ? Something you 're gonna see , but I wanted to show you first . They were taken from the security cameras in the FBI parking garage . One of them shows you arrive in a cab meeting John Doggett . Yeah . I 'm working with him . He called me up here on a case . I heard , believe me . This whole thing about a chase and a crash and a fire . And now Doggett 's internal investigation of Deputy Director Kersh , it 's big news . What 's so important to show me ? What 's on the other tape ? How 's your investigation going , John ? Have you turned up any incriminating evidence on me yet ? It 's only Monday morning , sir . It 's nothing personal , Deputy Director . I hope you know that . I know , John . I think we 've pretty much always seen eye to eye . I 'm sure if you can 't find anything on me , John , nobody can . Hi . How are you doing ? That good . I didn 't ask to be put down on the X-Files . Kersh put me here . I 'm just doing my job . What did he think ? That I 'd be thankful ? That I 'd do anything less ? It 's not gonna be easy . Hell , no . I 'm going after a deputy director , one man removed from the head of the FBI . No . I mean it may be impossible . - What 's this ? - A tape two nights ago from the FBI garage . You 're not on it . What are you talking about ? No . This is the wrong damn tape . I 've been backwards and forwards . There 's nothing there . AD Skinner and I were attacked and chased . Knowle Rohrer drove his car into the garage wall . It blew up in flames . Not on this tape . - Where 'd you get this ? - From someone giving me a heads-up . They can 't make this go away . There 's evidence in that garage . There were victims . I went down to that garage , John . Whatever happened , they 've had 48 hours to clean it up . - There were witnesses . - Witnesses who will stand up to this tape ? Mulder ? Mulder , you here ? Naval Telecommunications Command . I need to make a shore-to-ship call to the SS Valor Victor . Sir ? Sir ? - What ? What 's the matter ? - I 've been trying to call you . The phone 's off the hook because of the baby . I got panicked you weren 't gonna be here , that you left too . Come in . I 'm looking for Mulder . Went to his apartment . - I know . - Where 'd he go ? Dana , where 'd he go ? He 's gone . He 's just gone . I don 't know where Mulder is . I don 't know that I 'd tell you if I did . I checked with movers , airlines , car rental agencies . No Mulder . Somebody get to him ? That it ? Doesn 't seem possible , does it ? OK . So where 's that leave us ? It 's just me and you - our word against Kersh and the FBI . You 'd better sit down . It 's more complicated than that . - What 's more complicated ? - This investigation . What about it ? I wanna ask you to drop it . No , not from you . Not from you , not after what we 've been through . We barely escaped with our lives . That 's something worth thinking about . I 'm sorry . You 're not that reasonable . What ? Did they get to you too ? No one got to me , John . They didn 't have to . That 's the point . You 're afraid of them . - I 'm not afraid of them . - Well , you 're afraid of something . What ? The real tape showing up ? Them calling you a killer for you having to shoot Krycek ? No . I 'll stand by my actions , but I won 't stand by yours if you 're gonna push and push until you get somebody killed . You wanna know what I fear ? I fear for Mulder and Scully . I fear for the life of that child if you don 't stop pushing . You don 't think I fear for those things ? If you did , you 'd let it go . So what I 'm hearing is , if I don 't drop it ... I 'm alone on this . John . You 're not . Hi . I hope it wasn 't presumptuous of me , I ordered you a martini . No . The presumption 's all mine . Anyway , I called and asked you out , didn 't I ? You actually had me confused a little this morning in my office . I had this crazy notion that you were avoiding me . Maybe I was trying to avoid myself . And those tapes you pulled out of your desk weren 't exactly Pamela and Tommy Lee . And I 'd heard that you and John Doggett were tight . You make it sound like I go home from work with Post-its on my ass . It 's nothing like that . Then I don 't get it . Why risk your name and your career getting caught up in this rabid investigation of his ? There isn 't going to be an investigation . Not any more . I wouldn 't have thought Doggett 'd be thrown off so easy . Not what I 've heard about him . Whatever you may think about him , Brad , he 's not a fool , you know . Now you 're pissed off at me . No . I 'm pissed off because this means I 'll be shipping back to the New Orleans field office . What are you talking about ? The way I heard it , you 're with the X-Files . This investigation drops , they 're gonna drop the X-Files along with it . You know me , where my interests lie - this was my dream assignment . Not to mention how excited I was to be up here in DC . - But you just got here . - Yeah , I know . I 'm really sorry . I ... - Dana , I need your help . - I don 't know how to find him . It just doesn 't make any sense . Mulder leaving you here all alone . Just walking out on you , not telling you where and why ? It makes sense in its own way . That 's all I can tell you . Then tell me why you can 't trust me . Everything I did to protect you when your baby was in danger , what changed ? Why is it suddenly I 'm now the enemy ? Let it go , John . Drop it . Please . They tried to kill me and Skinner , and would have killed Mulder too . They 're still out there . Exactly right . And they are unstoppable and they are inside the FBI . You know something you 're not telling me . Mulder knows something . How long can you hide from it ? Knowle Rohrer , my old military buddy , told me your pregnancy was the result of a cloning experiment to create a super-soldier . I don 't wanna hear this . There is nothing to any of this . Knowle Rohrer , my buddy , was one of the men that tried to kill us in the FBI garage . My baby , my son , is fine . I hope to God that 's true . I just don 't wanna pretend . I 'm gonna ask you to leave . I 'm gonna ask you to leave and not come back here . Directory assistance . Let 's try Maryland , Virginia . What listing , please ? A number for a Ryan Bracker . B-r-a-c-k-e-r . I was given this number for a Roger Erickson of the US Marine Corps . - Yeah , speaking . - Roger ? - Hey . It 's John Doggett , Bravo Company . - How you doing ? I 'm good . It 's good to hear you . - Listen , you remember Knowle Rohrer ? - Yeah , sure . What 's his story ? Didn 't he get involved in something when we got back ? Special Ops ? No idea . I never heard from Knowle after we got back . We should get together . Yeah . Let 's ... let 's catch a beer sometime . This is Shannon . Leave a message and I 'll return it as soon as I can . Hi . This is John Doggett . I 'm trying to reach a Shannon McMahon , of Bravo Company . If this is she , could you contact me at the FBI in Washington , DC as soon as possible ? Sleepy time , sweet William . I 'll see you in a couple of hours . Hello ? Monica Reyes . Yeah , it 's Scully . Dana ? What 's wrong ? Are you all right ? - Is Agent Doggett there ? - Yeah . He 's right here with me . Dana ? Is something wrong ? Yeah . Yeah , something . Um ... I think I might have been wrong telling you to drop your investigation . I didn 't drop it . We found something . I 'm not sure how it fits but we 're working on it . - What is it ? - A body . Thanks for coming . The deceased 's name is Carl Wormus , of the Environmental Protection Agency . Drove through a barricade and off a bridge two nights ago . And ? Somebody at the FBI thought it important enough to stick his obituary under our noses . - Who ? - We don 't know . His blood alcohol level was upwards of point one five . He was drunk . He crashed and drowned . There 's gotta be something more . John Doggett . - What the hell are you doing ? - Excuse me ? Do you know how many people are waiting to see you screw up , make a mistake like this ? I didn 't know I made a mistake . This EPA guy that you checked out of the morgue without any jurisdiction . Come on . All your friends , all your former FBI buddies . - What ? - They 're not your pals any more . Not since this investigation of yours . Since you launched an attack on one of your own . Just watch your back . Definitive answer how this guy died - what would that take ? A careful autopsy . - How fast ? - That 's not what I 'm saying . I 'd understand if you don 't wanna do this , but you 're the only person we can trust . Collecting for the needy and unemployed . Open the door . Thanks for doing this , guys . Like we 've got anything better to be doing these days . Just to let you know . We may need to hit you up for some coin . Why ? What happened to you guys ? Don 't ask . We hacked into the Department of Interior 's mainframe and got the EPA files you wanted on this man Carl Wormus . - And ? - Hey . Are we mind-readers ? That 's all you asked for . What exactly was it you were looking for ? If we may ask . I don 't know . If he had any secrets , he took them to his grave . Nothing hinky in his files except some kind of rabid obsession with water . - With water ? - Water . Asphyxiation induced by the inhalation of water . There 's contusions on the forehead and chest , but the impact didn 't kill him . This man drowned . You 're looking like you hope there 's something more , but there isn 't . I 'm sorry . That 's not it . I 'm just impressed that you can do this . This is what I do , Agent Reyes . But you 're here doing it now . Something did happen , didn 't it ? I know what you 're afraid of . That there 's something wrong with your baby . We can let our fears get the better of us . We can imagine things , make connections with things that aren 't there . Like with this man . If you ever feel the need to talk to someone , Dana , I 'm here . I 'd never betray a confidence . There is something . - What ? - Right here on the ankle . - Are those fingerprints ? - Yeah . That 's what they look like . From someone holding him down ? I don 't know how , or who . I don 't know if you 're aware of where Agent Scully is . She 's at Quantico . Called in by John Doggett to autopsy a body he 's got no authority to touch . If I may be blunt , sir . Doggett 's put his tit in the wringer . Maybe . So what ? A lot of us think that he 's lost all judgment . And one man 's actions should not affect the entire FBI . We feel he should be called out for this . Punished ? Yes , sir . Thank you , Assistant Director . It 's a difficult situation to be in . I appreciate you doing this . - It was the right thing to do . - Let me know how it goes . Me ? Oh , no , I can 't , sir . There 's a conflict . I can 't do this myself . I can 't very well do it . How would it look ? I 'm under investigation by Agent Doggett . You have no personal axe to grind . Hello . Can I help you ? Hi . I 'm looking for Dana Scully . She 's not here . Can I tell her who 's calling ? We work together . Do you know where I can find her ? No , Um ... Would you like to leave a message ? I 'll leave her a note , if you wouldn 't mind opening the door . Why don 't you just leave your name ? I 'll have Dana call you . You need to get this body into refrigeration to preserve him as evidence . Whatever he 's evidence of . Whatever it is , I can 't reach John to even tell him . Monica , I don 't know what to say . But good luck . I gotta go . I gotta get home . Third floor they have a cooler for the teaching cadavers . You can temporarily put him there . Behind us . Just keep walking . - Who is she ? - I 'd never seen her before this morning . Now I 've seen her twice . - Excuse us . Where 's Agent Doggett ? - What are you doing , Brad ? What am I doing ? I 'm doing my best to cover your ass . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm talking about these . - Let go of me . - What 's going on here ? OK . Where 'd he go ? Who ? Where 'd who go ? Where did Doggett take the body ? You 're not making any sense , Brad . Agent Doggett didn 't take any body anywhere . You 're looking at me like you don 't believe me . Ask Agent Scully . I 'm gonna go now . I 've got a child at home . Body or no body , you were here doing an autopsy . Doggett was here , without authorization . - Without authorization ? - He 's out of control , you know , Monica . Forget the X-Files . He 'll take you down with him . This was you , wasn 't it ? You floated that obituary to me to set Agent Doggett up . Using me ? What obituary ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You came to me for help . Remember ? I 'm only trying to help you help yourself . I know exactly what you 're doing . Don 't forget to piss on all the corners before you leave . I didn 't float any obituary . What 's she talking about ? Son of a ... Yeah ? Oh , hello . Considering the violence attempted on Doggett , you might wanna know who 's at the door before you actually open it . Next time I 'll get a chair . - Agent Doggett 's gone . - What do you mean " gone " ? He and Skinner split for Maryland together . Show her what we found , before she makes any nasty remarks . It took some real hacking , but Carl Wormus - the man from the EPA who drowned in his car - he 'd been receiving encrypted email data from a water reclamation plant in Maryland , from a worker there named Roland McFarland . - Encrypted data on what ? - Don 't know , But whatever it is may have gotten both these men killed . There are no nameplates . Yeah , I see that . This is madness . Even if he connects to your investigation , we don 't know the right area . This has gotta be McFarland 's area . This might be his desk . - Let 's just grab the hard drive and go . - I 'm not sure if it 's his . Somebody 's gonna come walking in any minute and it 's not gonna matter . Just keep an eye out . - What 's chloramine ? - Why are you asking me about chloramine ? Because this is McFarland 's desk . He 's got tons of files on chloramine . - I 'm betting it figures into all this somehow . - Agent Doggett . Grab the files and go . Shh ! Argh ! Assistant Director ! Looks like you and I are chasing the same man . Agent Doggett ! I made this !

Ah , maybe they 're right . Maybe Nibbler is dumb . Don 't listen to them . People said I was dumb , but I proved them . Good news . We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 . But it 's been completely destroyed . - Why is that good news ? - They paid in advance . [ SPRING TWANGS ] - Excuse me . - This is mighty strange . First , Space Rome collapsed . Then , Don Martin 3 went caflooie . And now Tweenis 12 . - This planet is next . - That 's Earth . - The planet we live on ? - I 'd hate to be those guys . [ CRIES ] What 's got into him ?

Nibbler , you 're scaring me . Nibbler ? ! Am I going crazy ? Have my years of hedonism caught up with me ? Nibbler , help ! Don 't leave me here ! LEELA : Nibbler ? Could you scooch the seat up , just a little bit ? [ MUMBLES ] - Leela back yet ? - Help me ! My heart stopped ! - You don 't have one . You 're a robot . - Sure . Right . Robot . Oh , Fry ! My skin 's all dry and clanky . - Well , yeah . Robots are made of metal . - Am I a robot ? I don 't get this scam . You already have my power of attorney . Fry ! [ STAMMERS ] My skin ! Ow . Ow . Ow . I 'm a genius ! Why is everyone acting so weird ? Zoidbee want balloon ! Want balloon now ! Zoidbee want go outside ! Oh , I just let you back in ! Unbelievable ! I thought you were a furry little moron . But here you are flying an adorable spaceship ! If only you could talk . [ SPEAKS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ] Wait ! I understood that ! You 're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain ? You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid ? Oh , stupider . And you say we 're headed for your home planet where you 've lived since the beginning of the universe ? So , how did the universe begin ? Then the meaning of existence ... ? So every religion is wrong . [ GURGLES ] You fell ! Hi ! Some bad things happened . One bad thing Was a train got crashed . Wanna see ? People Won 't be late , though . The governor said : " I 'm sending in more trains . " WOMAN : Go ! MAN : Wait for me ! Morbo can 't understand his Teleprompter . how do you say the letter that looks like a man With a hat ?

We shall appear to be speaking your language . - Do not be afraid , child . - I 'm not afraid . Uh , good . Good . So , your real name is Lord Nibbler ? It is for your sake . By the time you pronounce one letter of my name a trillion cosmoses would sink into eternal night . Oh , you 're all so cute . No , we are an ancient , powerful race . Behold . When the universe was forged in the big bang our mighty race was already 17 years old . - Aw . - Mm . NIBBLONIAN 1 : For the first millisecond , things were okay . But there arose a terrible enemy , the Brain Spawn . [ CHATTERING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE ] Ever since , we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful- - Lunch is ready . Then let the feast of 1000 hams begin ! [ CHEWING ] [ BURPING ] Why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth ? They hate all consciousness . Thoughts screech at them like the forced laughs of movie patrons . Thus , they travel making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought . Wipe out thought ? My God ! They 're flying televisions ! And even we are powerless to stop them , fearsome though we are . [ PURRS ] There is one being who can resist . A child of destiny whose bizarre brain waves make him immune to their attack . He is the hope of the universe . The fate of your world , perhaps all worlds , rests in his special mind . Now , when you say " special " ... . [ SIRENS WAIL ] Attention New New Yorkers ! Stop acting so stupid ! [ SQUAWKS ] [ SCREAMS ] NIBBLONIAN : Fleet holding at perimeter of Moron Zone , formerly known as Earth . Why would Fry be immune ? Because he doesn 't shower ? They suppress intelligence by attacking delta brain waves . Every animal and robot generates this wave , as do certain trees . NIBBLER : Fry , however , does not . [ FLAT BEEP ] Somehow , he has cobbled random brain waves into a working mind . - Like a carpet-remnant prom dress . - Like your prom dress . The Brain Spawn are commanded by a brain with a gooey center of pure hate . Only Fry , with his superior , yet inferior mind , can approach it . Tell him to disable it . We will do the rest . - You can count on me . - No . - On Earth , you will be too stupid . - That 's why we wrote it down for you . We also prepared a bag lunch and mittens . Time to reeducate you dunces . We 'll start with presidents . This was our first president , George Washington . Let 's review . Who was our first president ? Um ... . - A pickle jar ? - Thomas Jefferson ? [ ENGINE ROARS ] Leela ! I 've been so worried ! Are you a bonehead ? I ... have to tell must ... important ... something ... . You 're going a mile a minute . This ... you for this ! Thanks ! No ! - Ow . Fire hot ! - The professie will help . Fire indeed hot . Oh , Chester A. Arthur fall down . Brain . Brain make people dumb . No , Leela . Brain make people smart . [ GROANS ] - You go fight biggest brain . - Even bigger than those ? - Where is it ? - I don 't know . A giant brain is basically a giant nerd . And where would a giant nerd be ? [ GASPS ] The library ! Pathetic human race . Arranging knowledge by category made it easier to absorb . Dewey , you fool , your decimal system has played right into my hands . [ LAUGHS ] - What do you want ? - I 'm here to kick your ass ! Wishful thinking . We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses . Odd . My stupefaction field is having no effect on you . That 's right ! You 'll find a little knowledge is a dangerous thing ! Better think of a new plan . Come on , think . Thinking . Thinking ... . [ BUZZING ] BRAIN : Oh ! Stop that ! Thinking hurts him ! Maybe I can think of a way to use that . [ BRAIN GROANS ] Prepare to be thought at ! Leela , give me a topic . - Duh ... . - I can 't think of anything . [ BRAIN LAUGHS ] Gotta find something . Hardy Boys ? Too easy . Nancy drew ? Too hard . Perfect ! Bonfire of the Vanities ! BRAIN : No ! It 's unbearable ! They 're weakening . Nibblonians to Nibble stations . Prepare Cuddle Bug for deployment . - Sometimes I fear we are cute . - Oh , niggle-snooch . Take that ! This one I don 't understand . But take this one ! Ooh . You have not won yet . Each book is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever ! Icky ! Where are we ? A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale . - Big whale over there . - I saw it first . Wait ! That no white whale ! It gray thinkie whale ! Let go of me ! I have to kill it ! BRAIN : You will all be trapped in this dense symbolist tome forever ! Follow him ! It 's our only way out ! Have you seen a giant brain ? Yep . I let him help with the fence . Tom Sawyer , you tricked me . This is less fun than previously indicated . Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity . - No ! - Come on ! Mr. Fry ? Mama says you 're quite the oddity . - A bachelor at your age . - I 'm an oddity ? Wait till- - The most eligible landowner in all Hartfordshire , Mr. Brainley . I 'm a gigantic brain ! - I say ! - Most ungentlemanlike . What news have you of the London season ? - Well ... . - Hey , think fast ! I always think fast . The whale ! He be white now ! [ SCREAMS ] I 've got an idea . Stay here with Queequeg . Is there a Mrs. Queequeg ? Yes ! I 'm free ! All right , brain ! Get ready for some electroshock treatment ! Fry , don 't die ! Wake up ! No ! [ BRAIN LAUGHS ] " Leela cried as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase . The Big Brain laughed in triumph . Then , for no reason , he left Earth forever . The End . " There ! Now he 's trapped in my book , full of plot holes and spelling errors . The Big Brain am winning again ! I am the " greetest " ! Now I am leaving Earth for no " raisin " ! [ CHEERING ] The Big Brain is defeated . Let what must be done , be done . Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties . I did it ! And it 's all thanks to the books at my local library . NIBBLER : And so , life returned to normal . Or as normal as it gets on this dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes . The people of Earth had no memory of What had transpired . Except Fry . And no one believed him or cared What he had to say . I returned to my post , ever-vigilant , lest Earth again come under attack . And When that day comes , God help us . God help us all . Time for a diapie change . NIBBLER : End transmission . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

 Mmm . Oh , yeah ! It wants our minds ! We are the vessels ! Shut it out ! I thought we were , like , the saviors of humanity . Shut it out ! Since when do we break up bar fights ? I 'm with Cleo on this one . This guy 's gone into vapor lock . Let the bouncers handle him . Voice says he 's important . Important and stupid . Frying his brain out with that toxic crap . He 's not a gas addict . His name 's Jensen Manning . He 's involved in very sensitive research on the Bailies . I 'm sending a Confessor to assist you . Voice is sending a Confessor to try and talk him down . What 's a Confessor ? People go to them to whine about their problems . Some say they have empathic powers . That 's a bunch of garbage if you ask me . Maybe you should give it a try sometime . Please stand back . Listen to my voice . No one here will hurt you . Hurt me ? Keep away ! You 're the one who 'll get hurt ! Give me your pain . My mind is open to yours . Give me your anguish . Please . Too many minds ! I have to get out ! Yes . Yes , your pain . Give it to me . I told you to keep away ! Sarge ! What the hell ! Holy sh ... Five hundred years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home .

Gross ! What was that ? I don 't know . He 's dead . What happened ? Be happy you don 't remember . Hel , get the Confessor back to the lab right away . If he 's carrying some kind of parasitic infection , we need to contain it . You 're comin with us . S and M bar 's two levels down , boys . Betrayers . Oh , no . Oh . Come on ! Jump ! Cleo , don 't inhale ! Cleo ! Oh , pretty . Cleo , get down ! More . Sarge . I saved her the last time . Oh ! I love you , Sarge . That 's nice . Whoa . Those Betrayers want the Confessor . No , they want that thing that 's inside him . They 've got energy shields . That 's new for Betrayers . Can we get through ? It doesn 't look like it ! I love you , Hel . Yeah , I love you , too , Cleo , but now is not the time . Okay . Betrayers are 200 % human in this form , right ? That means they 'd feel the effects of the gas same as Cleo . Let 's get happy . Ha , ha , good shot ! Hold your breath ! Sarge , get Cleo . Come on . Oops . Mauser , we need a complete medical diagnostic now ! Voice alerted me . Let 's get him in the healing tube . The pain ! Take my pain . He seemed fine 20 minutes ago . Yeah , well , whatever it is , it works fast . Is it contained , Mauser ? Yes . Something went into him , Mauser . It looked like robo-cockroach . Can you get it out of him ? I don 't know . I can try . You know , I saw this movie once where this bug thing clamped onto your spine and you had to scream to kill it . Don 't scream . It seems to be designed to interface directly with the human nervous system . What do you mean ? Somebody built this thing ? Yes . It appears to be some kind of organic data retrieval unit . It 's downloading everything in the Confessor 's brain . That explains why the Betrayers want it . It must have accessed everything Dr. Manning knew before it jumped into the Confessor . You think the Bailies sent it down here on purpose ? The spy who bugged me . Mauser . Neural output zero . He 's dead . It sucked him dry . It 's lookin for a new home . Oh , Mauser , can you kill it ? I 'm not sure , but it 's harmless as long as the field holds . That 's the main power ! Mauser ! Go to backup ! Nobody move ! Oh , something touched my leg ! That was me . There it is ! Hold your fire ! So much for " don 't move . " Let 's find this thing . Sarge . Nothing . Sorry . Well , I can 't find it . Voice , can you scan the lab for a fix on that parasite ? Hel , I 'm not picking up anything . It isn 't there . What do you mean it isn 't here ? Well , then where is it ? Oh , man . It 's in one of us . All right , everyone just stay calm . I 'll do my best , but it 's a little hard considering there 's an incredibly gross parasite sucking on somebody 's brain ! Well , I know it 's not in me . You don 't know anything . It could be in any one of us . Mauser , can you run a biomed scan on all of us ? Impossible . With main power out , the med scanner is off-line . That 's excellent . I guess we 'll just wait here until one of us turns into a raving lunatic and dies . Can you come up with another scan ? I think so . The parasite disrupts the victim 's brain chemistry . A simple tissue analysis should reveal its presence . Do it . I just need a tiny sample of your brain tissue . OK , but don 't take too much . Done . Sure you got enough ? Sure you didn 't get the whole thing ? After I collect a sample from each of us , an analysis will reveal who is harboring the intruder . Hel , your turn . Get it over with . Sarge . I believe it 's in Hel . Betrayers outside . They must have tracked the parasite here . Sarge , secure the lab . That thing 's inside you , Hel . It 's still me . Secure the lab or we all die . I 've routed all auxiliary power to lab defensive systems . But that door 's not gonna hold out long against the Betrayers . I know . Mauser , find a way to get this thing the hell out of me . I don 't know if there is a way . Well , what do you mean ? We 've got to do something . When the parasite invaded the Confessor , it lived off the bioelectric energy of his neural tissue . Only when that energy was expended did it leave his body . So it won 't leave till I 'm dead ? At least do what you can , Mauser . Sarge ? Hel , what 's happening ? Sarge . That parasite , it 's been here a very long time , spying on us . Watching us for the Bailies . Dr. Manning wasn 't the first . There are dozens , dozens of them . It-It 's taken their minds . And they 're all inside of me now . If it takes mine , it 'll know about the team . You 're all in danger . You have to kill it . Oh . We have to do something . What ? It 's not gonna leave her till she 's dead . No . I saw this movie once where they flat-lined these guys . Technically , they were dead , but they shocked them back to life . Yes . The parasite will leave her body . Then we can blast it and jump-start Hel . But how much of Hel 's brain has it already drained ? If we force it out of her , will it take Hel 's mind with it ? I don 't know . But if we don 't get it out now , she 's already dead . I 'm gonna have to divert power from the lab defenses to generate a strong enough charge to stop Hel 's heart . We don 't have a choice . Do it . Do it . Mauser ? No heartbeat . Well , where is it ? There it is ! Auxiliary power failing ! Bring her back , Mauser ! Start her heart back up ! I 'm trying . No effect . There 's not enough power . Hurry ! Come on , Mauser ! It 's no good . There 's not enough power . Huh . Sarge , duck ! Look out ! Now , Mauser ! Hit it ! Hit her again ! It 's no good . There 's not enough power . It 's too late . Stand back ! Sarge ? What have we got to lose ? Hel , are you all right ? Hel . Sarge . Mauser . Who are you ? Gotcha . Ready for self-destruct and evac on your signal . Well , another lab bites the dust . Huh . So , any revelations from the other side ? Bright light , long tunnel ? Dearly departed waiting with open arms ? No . No . Nothing like that . What is it , Hel ? When I had that thing inside me , there were all these people that it had assimilated . All these voices , all these minds . I guess the silence is just a bit deafening . If I were you I 'd be happy to have my head all to myself again . Yeah . Well , almost . Which reminds me , there were quite a few people that knew Voice pretty well . Uh-huh . I learned quite a few new things about you , Voice . Really ? Would you care to share ? No . I think I 'll be the one keeping the secrets for a while . Come on , team . Let 's blow this joint .

 500 years had passed , and still the land was closed off . It was isolated from the world , and knew neither hope nor despair . An atmosphere of total stagnation ruled the land . The rebels who dared to start an uprising ... were eliminated by the state . The House Takemikazuchi ... was a band of assassins , hired to quell this rebellion . For a long time past ... they were the bodyguards of the rulers from a neighboring country . But this land had overthrown its monarchy . So they fled to this land , branded as exiles . Now they 're a band of mercenary assassins . Selling their skills to anyone in need of effective killing . The Takemikazuchi . Mother . Byakurai is looking for you . Anka ran away this morning . If he has deserted the Takemikazuchi ... he will betray our secrets . He wants to flee to the Shikon-mountain . But with that leg of his , he won 't even have reached the old mine yet . Yuki . Take Kiri with you . I go alone . I 'm going too . - He will only slow me down . Take me with you . That 's what Byakurai wants . Would you really kill Anka ? Of course . And when he begs for mercy ? Even then I 'll kill him . I don 't think so . Yuki , it 's you . I 'm unarmed . Don 't kill me . Please . Take my sword . Just tell them you 've killed me . Alright ? I see that I 'm no longer a match for you , Yuki . Who are you ? My name is Kuka . I used to work for your mother . I 'm here to tell you something . About the way your mother died . You believe that she was killed in a raid . But she was murdered by Byakurai . You 're lying . Byakurai is the murderer of your mother . Azora , princess Takemikazuchi . You must avenge her and take your mother 's rightful place . Or leave . Tomorrow is your 20th birthday . On that day , a princess becomes the leader of the Takemikazuchi . You must take over the House 's leadership . Or you must leave . Should you decide to leave ... come to meet me at the old mine . With this i have delivered the message from Azora to you . Did Anka beg for mercy ? Did my mother beg for mercy ? What do you mean ? Your voice is quivering . You think feverishly . Do you realize what you 're doing ? Tell me ! Byakurai . Did you kill my mother ? No . Yuki , put away your sword . I 'll overlook this incident . I never meant to tell you this . Your mother was killed , because she wanted to betray us . And wanted to flee . - Liar . Stop it . Fighting will only make this worse . You leave me no choice . Die . Important news from the Assembly . The ministry of Consumption reports ... that the living-standard has increased by 20 percent last year . To celebrate this news ... the citizens took to the streets . It turned into a spontaneous parade of rejoicing . Aya . What 's wrong ? You want to kill me with this ? You 're of the Takemikazuchi aren 't you ? Who sent you ? Tell me . Where are the others ? There are no others . And I don 't want to kill you . You 're lying . You expect me to believe that ? Trust me . Trust you ? You 're prepared to kill anybody for money . If I trust you , that will get me killed . If it were you I was after ... you 'd be dead right now . Do you trust me now ? Doesn 't that hurt ? - Of course it does . If you allow the pain . I saw a girl . Where is she ? I 'm alone here . That bed is mine . - Goodnight . We 've lost her . On the way through the forest . Is that all you have to report ? No . Someone saw a car . We 're keeping an eye on the road . She 'll be back . She wants revenge . Somebody told her . But who ? That 's the question . Yuki turned 20 today . Whoever told her about Azora must have known that and its meaning . Kuka . She wants to kill you , to avenge Azora ? Then she will be coming here . There can be no doubt . Suppose Kuka would want to speak with Yuki . Where would he meet her ? Where he lives maybe . I 'd do it somewhere else entirely ... How are you ? It 's me , Kidokoro . I 've returned . There 's something I want to talk to you about . I 'm coming today . No , I will come to you . The day after tomorrow . Agreed . I 'll be waiting for you at the usual location . A man once made a promise to Azora , heiress to House Takemikazuchi . He swore fealty to the House . But Byakurai branded him a traitor and killed him . That man was my father ? You wouldn 't be able to remember that , you were only 2 years old . The Takemikazuchi still had many members back then . Byakurai wanted to marry Azora himself . And make House Takemikazuchi his own . But Azora refused this . In her desperation she wanted to disband the Takemikazuchi . But Byakurai found out about it , and ended her life . That changed everything . Many were dissatisfied with Byakurai . They tried to detach themselves from him . But there were only few who managed to escape . Most of them had to pay for their attempt with their lives . Only one or two got away . This is the place where princess Azora died . Undoubtedly she hoped for you to leave the Takemikazuchi . She wanted you to succeed where she had failed . There is no sense in seeking out Byakurai for vengeance . The Takemikazuchi are doomed to disappear Princess Yuki . Your mother was tortured to death in this place . But the final blow was dealt by me . You may kill me now if you wish . Since then I 've been waiting only for this day to come . I offered to join her on her journey to the other side . But she didn 't allow me to . She ordered me to tell you everything . Once you reached the age of 20 . Princess Yuki is the one who must slay me now . Don 't say that . That would be pointless . So it was you , Kuka . Soma . My , how you have grown . If you 'll allow me ... This is what I 've wanted . Princess Yuki , do not die . Kill me if you want . But don 't raise your sword against princess Yuki . I can 't promise you that . When I was little ... I used to be cheerful all the time . I never dreamed ... that it would end like this . Do you know why people thought like that back then ? Because nobody had ideals . Certainly , people died because of our bomb at the Assembly . But is was very effective . You should be proud of that . But it was a holiday . The Assembly would be empty . That 's what you told me . Some losses are inevitable . We don 't get it for nothing . Mimura knew that . He did not die in vain . Nobody will pay us any heed if there aren 't any civilian deaths . I want to move on to the next project now . Sugimoto ... thought differently . Did he call you while I was gone ? Last month . Sugimoto is no longer with us . I have faith in you . We must be prepared to do whatever it takes for our ideals . Takashi . Do you know what the safest place in the jungle is ? On the back of the lion . The fleas on its back live an extremely peaceful life . What the ... Where are you bleeding ? You need protein . Otherwise you won 't heal . Put this on . It 's the only thing there is . Hurry up . It suits you . What are you doing ? I 'm throwing these away . Have you seen Kidokoro ? Takashi , beware of him . Have you heard about Sugimoto ? Kidokoro told me he is no longer a member . He 's dead . Murdered . I 'm leaving this country . There must be happiness somewhere . I 'm trying to find that . Who 's that ? She 's a guest . A guest ? So you have found happiness . Good luck to you . Let me know , should you want to come with me . Thanks . Why did you come back ? What happened this time ? You don 't want to tell me . It 's probably safer for me if I don 't know . Is it difficult for you to kill someone ? Why do you kill people ? For the money ? My body moves . When I 'm holding my sword , and approach the victim ... my body seems to move by itself . Without any conscious thought . Ah , poor you . A monarch no longer wants to pay his bodyguards . So they take their talents elsewhere . You just kill people . Not to defend your country , not to defend yourself . You have nothing to defend . You just kill . But I did ... have a reason . I certainly had a reason ... to kill people . A reason to kill . Come . My sister . When she was 8 years old , I came home from school one day . Everything was covered in blood . Only she was still alive . The perpetrators were acquitted , for lack of evidence . So I killed them myself . I was arrested . I was put on trial and convicted . When I came out 4 years later ... I had a completely different view of the world than I did before . Everything seemed different . And then I met someone . He told me ... that he wanted to see me as happy as I had been before . He was the only one who said that . I did things . I was forced to do things . To become happy again ... I rationalized everything . Renkyo . I need to talk to you . About what ? Can we really kill Yuki ? Without Yuki ... we will no longer have a leader of Takemikazuchi blood . And then ... - Then what ? There are only very few Takemikazuchi left . We 've lost almost everyone . But what reason is there for us to continue ? Without that name . - We don 't need a reason . There 's nobody for us to guard anymore . I honored our ancestors . I believed in the fatherland . But when the monarchy fell ... our swords were taken from us . Some were imprisoned . Their memories erased with drugs . To block their fighting power ... needles were stuck into their elbows . Some of us have fled . But never have we fought against the motherland . Do you remember , Renkyo ? Those tanks on the southern island ... that we encountered along the way ? Corroded by the acid rain . The stench of corpses filled the air . But there were no corpses . The stench came from us . At that moment ... we were dead . Hello . It 's me . Kidokoro . Why do you call ? I 've sent you some plans . Could you have a look at them ? Sure . I 'll be right back . Did you see it ? In ten days we 'll make our move . Are you there ? Ten days . I can 't make it . Alright . When can you ? Never . You won 't do it ? No . Very well . I 'll contact you later . You always look so somber . You 're expressionless yourself . Have you ever been somber ? I suppress it , like pain . And that 's how you can kill people ? When you 're somber ... you mourn . When you 're happy , you act cheerful . Have you ever laughed ? When I 'm somber , I mourn . For hours . For days . For years . Do you know what miki-ishi means ? No . It means ' beautiful gemstone ' . They 're very rare . Even if you search for a year ... you 'll find one at most . If you polish them , you will get a green crystal . My mother used to collect them . Whenever she had one , she 'd polish it and keep it safely . When she had thirty ... she 'd make them into a necklace for me . For my wedding day . She 'd put it around my neck on the day I was to be married . She started to collect when she was 18 . She had me when she was 22 . And she died when she was 27 . On the day she died , she had nine of those crystals . In a little box . Not enough for a necklace . Soon I 'll be as old as she was when she had me . And then as old as when she died . But I 've collected nothing to leave behind . To nobody . I don 't have anyone to leave something to . I have nobody . Nobody to cherish . Let 's go away from here . Away from this country . There 's nothing to keep us here . There must be a place somewhere . Away from here . A place where we can forget everything . Let 's go to that place . Your mother . At this moment ... I feel happy . But will you ever be capable of feeling happiness ? I don 't think so . Mother . Now ... I 'm happy . You will never know happiness . Even if you 'd kill me ... you will keep walking the path of death . That is unavoidable . Kidokoro . Your sister looks very well . What do you want from me ? Is it about the plans ? No , I have a different plan . It 's a very good plan . You will like it . What 's the plan ? We 'll strike a bargain with the government . We will accomplish our ideals , and there won 't be many casualties . What do you think , Takashi ? Good plan , isn 't it ? You 're betraying me ? It 's all been arranged . We keep quiet and our ideals will be safe . Traitor . We 'll continue in spirit . The plan that I sent you , would have been the last . Because we 'd all be dead afterwards ? Don 't talk to me like that . It 's what you 've always wanted . You have it your way . And so you keep out of harm 's way . - We 've made the deal . It 's a good deal . Then why did we do it ? Why all the casualties ? It meant something . We believed in our ideals . No , we all believed in you . Manabe shot . Kazuki tortured . Mimura blown up . They all believed in you . You said we 'd be happy again . But that only goes for you . Happiness will come . But not just like that . You knew the price would be high . We pray for the victims . Takashi . You won 't have to pray . Because you 're one of the victims we 'll be praying for . You bastard . I 'm Azora 's daughter . Princess Yuki of the Takemikazuchi . In the name of my mother ... I claim your life . Don 't you understand ? It 's over . Scram . I want to keep that . Live . Be happy . Live for me .

 Well you don 't get fruit like this back ... in jolly old London , I 'll say that . Yes , a veritable Garden of Eden complete ... with an enticing Eve . Care for a bite ? What was that ? It 's too early for the others to be back ... - Hello anybody here ? - Shhh . Oh ! a monkey ! - Shoot it ! - What ? That necklace belongs to me ! Why you little thief ! Come back here ! Marguerite wait up ! At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World . You 've eaten your last banana , you little wretch . No Marguerite ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ? Do you know how much that necklace is worth . Do you know the bad luck ... that will follow you around if you kill a monkey . Well it 's still got my necklace and it 's not getting away . Here it is . - What the ... - Oh ! Huh , monkey business has been good . Oh you 're a pretty one . Well he got away . Strange looking piece . In your hand the origin of all humanity . It worked . Oh yes it worked ! Yahooooooo ! Oh , Oh . Yes , I feel good ! Someone sounds happy . Or crazy . And I will never have to eat another termite ... as long as I live . Oh Billy . Yes of course Billy . It must be too late for you , I 'm sorry Billy . Who are you ? Who me ? What she means to say is we heard you shouting . Are you all right ? Oh yeah , I 'm fine . Why shouldn 't I be ? Never better . Were you chasing that thieving little monkey too ? Monkey ? What monkey ? I wasn 't chasing any monkey . Oh you mean , I was chasing my pet parrot Billy , beautiful precious Billy . Anyhow I gotta go . Adios . Hey wait , who are you ? How 'd you get on the plateau ? I 've had enough running around the jungle for one day . Umm , what an odd little man . Looks like we 've been robbed . Yeah , a monkey did it . - A monkey ? - Yeah . Anything else missing besides Marguerite 's priceless necklace ? Not so far as I can tell , but he sure made a hell of a mess . When I catch that pilfering primate ... I 'll have his guts for garters . Charming . This was the Moriarty of all monkeys . He had a stack of trinkets like you 've never seen . All of which you , reclaimed I 'm sure ? Don 't be cheeky . Most of it was junk , except for this . Is that a real emerald ? Yes but it doesn 't even come close to the ... value of the diamonds he stole from me . Still it 's striking . What 's this inscription say ? Something about someone 's hand and origin of all humanity . From dinosaurs we come . I sure had a few in my family . I wonder where it came from . Who cares ? It 's mine now . What if it belongs to one of the tribes ... who share this small piece of paradise with us ? Would you look at that , it stained my hand . - Did the same to me . - I wonder ... what could have caused that , maybe an oil or chemical in the rock ? Branded ? Will you look at that , just as I left it , a sight for sore eyes . trouble ... trouble Terrific , what the hell do you guys want ? You know what we want Jack Keller . What have you done with it ? Okay , I lost it . Well somebody stole it . It 's , it 's gone . Just as your friend stole it from us ? Yes , well Billy didn 't know it belonged to you , how was anyone supposed to know ? It was stolen from the spirit hut , you knew it didn 't belong to you . Okay , okay . Yeah well maybe we , maybe we never should have taken it but what can you do ? You live and you learn . Anyhow it was very nice to see you again Eba . You 're looking very good by the way . Come on Billy lets go . Right behind ya . You will take us to whoever has ... the stone or I will bury you in that little hole you 've dug . Don 't be silly . I would never fit in there . You will if I slice you into tiny little pieces . Okay well yes that would definitely solve that ... problem but I still don 't know who took the stone . Okay let me rephrase that ... I don 't know their names . But sure I can show you which way they went . In fact I can point you in the right direction from here . You will take us to them now . Isn 't that what I just said ? The origin of all humanity . I wonder what that could mean . What it means , is a stain I can 't get off my hand . Neither can Malone . Marguerite you might have warned me about this . I 'm sorry George I 'm a little preoccupied with the loss of ... my necklace , my exceedingly valuable diamond necklace . Yes , yes as you 've said , repeatedly . It is a fascinating effect though . The mark seems to be the result of ink or dye . But the etching on the stone , it 's colorless and dry to the touch . Someone 's idea of a practical joke . I 'm sure there 's something in the lab I can get this off with . Preferably something that will leave the skin intact . - Do you find it cold in here ? - No ! Not at all . Perhaps you 're coming down with something . Wonderful . Nothing , it 's either here to stay or wear itself off . That could take forever . It 's not that unattractive , is it ? If you don 't mind looking like a jungle savage . Are those mice you have in there ? Technically speaking they 're a dwarf ... species of the indigenous South American Hydrochoerus . But as Shakespeare might say a Rodentia by any other name ... Yes , well , I was planning to test a vaccine based on a Zanga remedy ... a cure for the common cold I hope . They 're very glossy looking . They should be , I found them in our food supply . Tsk tsk tsk , those naughty little rodents ... so round and plump . You sure you 're okay Marguerite ? Yeah , I 'm still a little chilly . Where 's the stone that marked Malone 's hand ? I just saw him down by the river trying to wash it off . Got me . Care to join the club ? - Where is it ? - Upstairs . Why ? What 's bothering her today ? I 'd better go and find out . Do you know where this came from ? Yes , we found that in the monkey 's cave ... part of its ill-gotten gains . This isn 't a joke Roxton . I think you should put it back where you found it . No argument from me . Marguerite has claimed it for her own though ... in that certain way she does . Listen to me , this stone is cursed . I beg you pardon ? Cursed , in what way ? I 'm not sure ... but I remember my parents warning me about a stone like this . That when you touched it , it left a permanent stain on you hand . And it made you very sick . It 's nothing , I 'm just a little chilled is all . Malone doesn 't feel well either . What about you , how do you feel ? I feel fine , perhaps just a little light-headed . Don 't tell me we 're all going to get sick because of a little stain . It is possible there are toxic substances in the stone . This is one of those things Science cannot explain , put it back . - Oh , alright ! - I 'll take it back . - I 'll come with you . - I 'll come too . I want to see exactly where that came from . Then I 'll stay here , I could use a nap . Well isn 't that nice . Looks like I 'm part of the club now too . I 'm sorry old fellow . So do you remember anything else your ... parents said about this sort of thing ? I 'm trying to think . I remember them meeting a woman with a ... mark on her hand but I can 't remember what happened to her . Very encouraging . What did I tell you ... there go your thieves ' right there . Take them . Maybe we should go to the Zanga village . Assai might know more about this . That 's not a bad idea . The Zanga legends have often proven true . This way . - Where the hell did that come from ? - I don 't know . I don 't see anyone . They 're all around us . Take cover ! - What do they want with us ? - Certainly not a peaceful dialog . There ! - That 's the man with the parrot . - What parrot ? Follow me ! Who are these savages ? Well , I 've got a train to catch . Hey , hey , hey easy guys put me down ... I 'm not going anywhere . You will stay with us until we recover the stone . Pray that we do . That 's using your head Challenger . I must try and remember that one . - I believe they 're after this . - How can you tell that ? Because that 's the man Marguerite and I saw at the cave . He obviously has something to do with this . What man at the cave . Well after we found the stone that man was ... screaming like an idiot and babbling to his parrot . - You didn 't tell us about that . - Sorry ... - other things to think about . - Babbling to his parrot ? Right , after he saw us he just took off . - Well he may have some answers . - We can talk about this later . - We 're not safe here . - Right . Whoa ! Thanks . It seems I 'm beginning to suffer the same ill effects from this ... cursed stain as Marguerite and Malone . I must be lucky I 've never felt better . - How are you feeling ? - Mmmmm , weird ... but warm , you ? Well I was feeling ... dizzy and light headed but now ... I just have this energy surging through me like ... the urge to run and jump . Sounds like cabin fever . What on earth are you doing ? There ! It 's a parrot . I don 't see anything . It 's right there . Well your eyes are much better than mine . Marguerite what are you doing ? Hanging on to you so you don 't fall . I 'm all right . Oh , your heart 's beating a mile a minute . It is ? I wonder why ? Isn 't it obvious ? Marguerite I think this fever is really starting to affect you . That 's funny , I 've never felt so normal in my life . Okay well why don 't you sit down ... and when Roxton comes home you can tell him all about it . Roxton oh yes I hope he 's soon . I 'm famished . I 'm feeling a bit peckish myself . Isn 't this fun ? Fun ? What are you doing Challenger ? Just taking a moment to smell the roses , well the clover actually . Smell it grrr sweet aroma . I don 't smell such a sweet aroma . I think your senses are playing tricks on you . Oh nonsense , my faculties have never been keener . - Which faculties are those ? - I 've got ... such boundless energy I could leap up that hill ... just for the sheer hell of it . In case you 've forgotten were headed for the Zanga village ... and we have some very unfriendly creatures tracking us . We do ? Can 't you hear them ? They 're only a few hundred yards behind us . - I don 't hear anything . - Nor I. - It 's just your imagination John . - It 's not my bloody imagination . Oh you are mine . - What are you doing ? - Stop it ! What are you doing ? John ! I 'm tired of being hunted like an animal . I say we kill them all . No , the fever 's obviously got a grip of you . Keep your hands off me . Now let 's get these wretched cowards . Hey , hey , snap out of it ! The Zanga village is that way . Fine by me Goldilocks . Now let 's get going . I 've never seen him like this . It 's baaad baaad behavior . So , you silly little rodents ... how would you like to come out and play ? Marguerite where are you ? Jack . Trouble ... trouble . Now where did you come from my fine feathered friend ? Pretty . Oh very pretty , very pretty indeed . Trouble , trouble , Jack , trouble . Don 't be a stranger . Nothing to be afraid of . We all have our place in the food chain . Marguerite ? Delicious . Would you like one ? Well now that you mention it ... they do look rather juicy . Very juicy . Not unlike you in fact . Now Marguerite lets not start that again . You have nothing to be afraid of my sweet ... little journalist . You 're so very warm and cozy . Maybe we could curl up together some place . You 're really starting to scare me Marguerite . You smell so succulent and savory . Marguerite ! I don 't know what has gotten into you ... but stay away from me . Stay away . But you 're just so irresistible . Will you stop picking berries and try to keep up . Not berries , leaves . You know it really is incredible how much of this environment is edible . That 's a thistle you 're eating . The more we eat the better prepared we are to fight our enemies . Fight them ? Why not eat them . Blood soup and leg of savage would certainly cure my hunger pangs . Listen to yourselves ... can you hear what you 're saying ? You two sound like animals . Oh Veronica don 't be ridiculous . In my mind that 's a very tasty arm you have . Oh no don 't put me on your menu . Let 's just get to the Zanga village okay . Those savages are on our trail again . Take this , I 'll hold them off . Let 's go ! Move it ! This is maaaagnificent . This is no time to stop and admire the scenery . But the view is incredible . Forget the view ! Run ! Challenger . Get them . What do you want ? Where are you taking us ? , ah . Let me go . Let me go . Can 't you see she 's wounded ? Where is it ? I don 't know . What is ' it ' ? The sacred stone belongs to us . - Who are you ? - We are the Kanu ... the origin of all humanity . In that case madam on the evolutionary scale you 're about ... one step ahead of pond scum . - Search him . - We don 't have the stone ! Jack Keller ... you have deceived me for the last ... Where did he go ? Find him . Look Marguerite I 'm sorry I ran away from you before . I know you 're not feeling so well . I 'm not feeling so great myself . What the hell 's wrong with me ? Feathers . Stay away ! Marguerite ? Is that you ? Whoa , whoa . You can 't hide with a stink like that . - Billy , - Jack . oh Billy I thought I lost you . Look out ... look out . You should have listened to the bird . No please , don 't hurt me . Okay . I never did anything . I 'm innocent . Where are my friends ? That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . Eba has them . - Keep talking . - Well , like I said ... I was trying to warn you but Eba and her savages kidnapped me . Tried to kill me , in fact . One more lie and I 'll rip your throat out . Of course , you 're angry . I mean ... who wouldn 't be . But believe me ... you gotta try to calm yourself because getting all ... upset is only gonna speed things up . Speed what up ? This is very baaad . Very baaad indeed . Challenger ... do you realize what 's happening to you ? I 'm transforming into some kind of animal , aren 't I ? We 'll find a way to stop it . If this is the result of a curse ... then we have to give the stone back to these people . It is getting so difficult to think straight but ... that inscription ... 'The origins of all humanity it must meeeean something . These people are evolving ... while I am going back to the beginning , back to the beginning . Back ... to where we all began . Marguerite ? Are you in here ? ready our not ? We all have our place in the food chain . Where 'd you get this ? Billy found it , I mean stole it , from the Kanu and gave it to me . I didn 't know it was cursed . How could I ? How does it work ? Everyone who touches the damn thing turns into an animal . Then why doesn 't it work on the Kanu ? I don 't know , maybe they 're savage enough already ... maybe they 're immune to it . All I know is ... Billy turned into a parrot , I turned into a ... I turned into a monkey . Ah yes , the monkey that robbed the treehouse . Exactly , you see I thought if I ... could get someone dumb , I mean someone else , to take back the cursed rock Billy and me would be cured . So you turned into the miscreant you are ... when we took the stone . Yeah right . I mean I do have some redeeming qualities ... but yes that is the gist of it . Then why didn 't the bird turn back ? I don 't know , it doesn 't make sense . Except that well maybe ... - Maybe what ? - Well like I said , Billy stole it but your friend stole it from me . So maybe only one of us could be saved ... the last to touch it . Shut up ! Shut up ! Sorry Billy , I didn 't know you were listening . Yeah ... yeah . So if I give this back to you I can save myself . Whoa ... whoa ... hey ... hey ... hey . I didn 't make these rules okay ? Me and Billy were just prospectors . We came here looking for gold and couldn 't find our way home again . I mean , now look at me , I got no treasure , I got a parrot for a mate What am I ? some kind of pirate ? Then take back your treasure . This emerald must be worth something ? Well thanks but what about your friends . You give it back to me and your friends will still be animals . Just like Billy . Mayday . If I lose them because of you . Now ... now remember what I said . Getting angry only makes it worse . Challenger you 're a man of science . You have to fight this . I can 't think . Your friend is almost gone . You have to stop this . You stole our stone . This is the price you pay . The pain . Where did you people come from ? and where did you get that stone ? From the hand who stole it from the Gods ... we killed him for his efforts . And all who tried to put it back must die as well . Challenger what 's happening to you ? I ... can 't ... help ... myself . Challenger ? Challenger ... do you understand me ? I didn 't think so . Great Spirit of the water hear our cries . We are your creatures . We have to find out where these savages came from . The origin of all humanity , lead us from the mire of oblivion . to the apex of enlightenment . Before the caves of darkness ... as the light spreads across the savage waters . - guide ... souls - Caves of darkness , savage waters I know where that is . Return it to our hands . Now you do exactly as I told you . Go ! Hey Eba look what I 've got . - Get him ! - Now I wish I was a monkey . Roxton thank God . I thought I 'd lost all of you . Where 's Challenger ? You 're looking at him . I haven 't eaten in so long . Listen ! I know what we have to do . Do you have the stone ? - Yes ! - Oh ! Good ! Come on , we have to hurry . Hey ! That 's Challenger you 're looking at . Remember ? The man you swore to protect with your life . - That was before . - No ! No ! No ! Stop it ! Do you hear me ? - Challenger no ! - The Kanu are coming back ... - time for them to die . - Listen no ! You 're going to help me save our friends Roxton . Come on . What is it ? Blood . Your arm . Oh you are so beautiful . Skin so smooth . Flesh so tender . You stay away from me , you understand ? Veronica I 'm sorry , I 'm losing the fight to understand . I can only feel like a ... and it feels wonderful . Roxton No ! John ! No ! Come on ! They 're headed for the savage waters , for our birth place . Get them ! There it is . - The place where it all began . - These savages came from a swamp ? That evil stone should have never been taken from here . That must be the place . Crocodiles . I wonder what else is in there . Drive them into the savage waters . I guess I 'm gonna find out . I 'll entertain our friends . Ah ! No ! Roxton ! What , toads ? The Kanu all turned into toads . It must have been what they were to begin with . The power of the stone worked in both ways . Your arm ? What about it ? Nothing . I just ... it looks as if it 's hurt that 's all . I 'll be fine . - Hi ho ! - It 's you again . Well all 's well that ends ... Oh . I hope that wasn 't Eba . What , so now all the dangers past I guess you 're on your way , is that it ? Who wants to leave ? I 've got my jewels back . I 'd say there 's quite a ot more up there too . What about your parrot ? Funny you should ask . Hey Billy come on out . I want you to meet my friends . Say hello to Billy guys . Oh who 's my pretty baby ? Grrrr . Malone , Marguerite ? Challenger , when did you get back ? I 'm not quite sure . I remember being captured by the Kanu . The next thing I remember ... I was waking up down in our compost heap with the most ... disturbing taste in my mouth and slivers . Ned ? It 's a long story . I could use a rope . And you might want to check on Marguerite , she 's in the lab . Good heavens my Hydrochoerus . Excuse me ? Well don 't just stand there ! Get me out ! Well let 's not be too hasty . After all it 's not often one sees such a ... rare species in captivity . Roxton ! - Sorry , can 't hear you . - Get me out ! It 's not funny !

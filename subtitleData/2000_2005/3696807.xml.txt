 [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Music swells ] [ Fast-paced , tense instrumental music ] BANNER : There 's simply no way to shield against every weaponized agent . But I can make super-immune systems ... by strengthening the human cellular response . Banner , I know where you 're going . But manipulating the immune system is dangerous and stupid . The President 's science advisors made it absolutely clear . No human subjects . EDlTH : David , I have wonderful news . I 'm gonna have a baby . [ Edith groaning ] [ Edith yelling ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Baby crying ] [ Soothing female vocals ] [ Baby babbling ] BANNER : What 's it gonna be ? Look at that . Want the dinosaur ? Come on , let 's have a little fight . Come on . You don 't scare me . [ Bruce growling ] BANNER : That 's a delicious eyeball . You 're big and green and scary . I 'll run away . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Women chatting ] Bruce , you 're hurt . Jack hit him with the stick , but Bruce wouldn 't hit him back . He just stood there , shaking . EDlTH : It 's okay . [ Gentle instrumental music ] friend : Strange he didn 't make a peep . Any other kid would 've wailed his head off . That 's Bruce . He 's like that . He 's just so bottled up . The samples we found in your lab , they were human blood . You 've ignored protocol . You had no right snooping around in my lab . - That 's my business . - Wrong , Banner . It 's government business and you 're off the project . [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] Attention , all personnel ! Fail-safe has been initiated . Gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minutes . Evacuate immediately. I repeat ... evacuate immediately ! [ Siren wailing ] Edith . - David , what 's going on ? - l gotta talk to you , Edith . EDlTH : Bruce , stay here . EDlTH : What are you doing ? [ Soft , tense instrumental music ] [ Thumping ] [ Shouting ] [ Growling ] [ Edith and Banner arguing ] EDlTH : David , please stop it ! No ! [ Edith and Banner yelling ] MRS. KRENZLER : Bruce , wake up , son . Bruce . Bruce . Another nightmare ? I don 't know. I don 't remember . BRUCE : Hi , Mom . Already off to college . - l 'm gonna miss you terribly . - l 'll miss you , too . Please , come here . Look at you . Soon to be a great scientist . BRUCE : I guess. I mean , who knows ? MRS. KRENZLER : I do . There 's something inside you so special . Some kind of greatness , I 'm sure . Someday you 're gonna ... share it with the whole world . Berkeley Nuclear Biotechnology Institute As far as I 'm concerned , security ought to be ... . Good morning , Dr. Krenzler . Security ought to be beefed up a lot more . In a place like this , you can 't be too careful . HARPER : Bruce . Big day . Did you sleep ? I didn 't sleep . - l slept okay. ls Betty here ? - She 's around . I really got to say , seeing you in that styling headwear ... . You implying something about my helmet ? You look like a massive nerd , even around other scientists . Can I just ask ? Were you wearing the helmet while she dumped you ? See , it protects my very important brain , Harper . Go prep the samples . Hey , I found you . Betty , hey ! - l hate them . - l just got here . Who do we hate ? The review board . We have to make a presentation on Tuesday . And you 're gonna make it with me . - You think I should ? - Yeah , you 're great with that stuff . You start talking about microbes and nanomeds ... you sound almost passionate . Sorry . That was rude . Look , nobody expects this to be easy ... us working together after being so close . We were close ? BRUCE : If I could be more ... whatever , you know. I 'm just ... . Don 't. lt 's not your fault , really . You 're just a byproduct of my inexplicable obsession ... with emotionally distant men . I 'll get over us . Good for you . Anyway , I 'm just really stressed about this review . If we don 't get impressive results , we 'll have a hard sell on Tuesday . Then let 's go be impressive . Harper . - Ready when you are . - Let 's hit it . [ Beeping ] Are we passing inspection ? Safeties all going green . Countdown started . Nanomeds released . Four seconds . BETTY : Okay . Nanomeds fully dispersed . Okay . Let 's hit Freddie with the gamma radiation . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Machine whirring ] Gamma exposure . Nanomeds now active . HARPER : Nanomeds replicating cells on border . It 's working . HARPER : Cell copy-to-disassemble ratio holding within 1 % . HARPER : lmbalanced nanomed activity . You want to tell the review board that we 've developed ... a brand-new method for exploding frogs ? Yeah. I think maybe there 's a market for it . What if there 's a plague ? What have you had , Betty , like one beer ? I 'm just saying , you know , frogs start falling from the sky ... who do they come to ? BETTY : We 'd be world-renowned . BRUCE : Make any parent proud . I bet they would be . BRUCE : They actually did want me to be a scientist . I mean your birth parents . BRUCE : I guess we 'll never know . I don 't understand why you don 't want to find out about them . They 're dead . They died before I could remember anything , any ... . Why do you always come back to this ? I don 't know . I guess I figure there 's more to you than you like to show . I guess there couldn 't be any less . Right . So now we come full circle back to that . Nice work , Betty . [ Soft instrumental music ] Betty . Glenn . BETTY : Hi . TALBOT : Hi . - What happened to your uniform ? - l switched over . I 'm still working with your father ... but the military 's subcontracting the most interesting work ... and I can 't argue with the paycheck . I basically run all the labs on the base now . You 're looking good . ... you 're the genetics expert . TALBOT : The good old college days . So , how 's business ? What do you want ? All right , I 'll cut to the chase . I 've heard interesting things about what you guys are doing . Your little molecular machines have some incredible implications . How 'd you like to come work for Atheon ... get paid 10 times as much as you are now ... and own a piece of the patents ? TALBOT : You just have to say the word . BETTY : Two words : the door . - General ? - Come in . Talbot wanted you to see this , sir . It 's about a lab Atheon is targeting to acquire and move to Desert Base . Why isn 't he going through NSC ? It concerns your daughter , sir . What happened to Benny ? He 's not working the night shift ? janitor : Benny 's dead. I 'm the new guy . BETTY : Good to meet you . janitor : Same . [ Melancholy instrumental music ] BRUCE : Let 's try another . BETTY : No , stay here . - l look tired anyway . - Yeah , but you look great . [ Birds chirping ] BRUCE : What 's the matter ? It 's these dreams , Doctor. I keep having them and they 're terrible . Tell me about your dream . It starts ... with a memory . I think it 's my first memory . It 's this image I have ... from when I was maybe two years old . [ Soft instrumental music ] BRUCE : Do you think it 's just a dream ? No , I think it 's something that happened ... when I was living at a desert base with my father . BETTY : [ Voice-over ] Anyhow , the dream goes on ... and suddenly I 'm alone . That 's terrible . You know I 'd never hurt you . [ Solemn instrumental music ] [ Dog panting ] Hey there . What 's your name , darling ? Okay. lt 's okay . [ Dog growling ] [ Key turning in lock ] [ Ominous instrumental music ] [ Typing ] [ Eerie instrumental music ] BANNER : I gotta talk to you , Edith . EDlTH : Bruce , stay here . [ Bruce cries out ] [ Dog barks in distance ] [ Ominous instrumental music ] [ Rhythmic instrumental music ] BANNER : C , T , G , A ... G. Bruce . My Bruce . Morning . Glenn dropped by . BRUCE : What 's he doing here ? TALBOT : You know , Dr. Krenzler ... we 've never had the chance to get to know each other properly . It 's because I don 't want to get to know you , properly or improperly . [ Pager beeping ] BRUCE : So leave . Hey , no worries . You know , let me give you a little heads up . There is a hair 's breadth between friendly offer and hostile takeover . I 've done my homework . The work you 're doing here is dynamite . Think : Gl 's embedded with technology ... that makes them instantly repairable on the battlefield ... in our sole possession . - That 's a hell of a business . - lt 's not what we 're doing here . We 're doing the basic science for everyone . You know , someday I 'm gonna write a book and I 'm gonna call it : " When Stupid ideals Happen to Smart Penniless Scientists . " In the meantime , Bruce , you will be hearing from me . [ Ominous instrumental music ] - About Glenn . - There 's nothing to talk about . I just wanted to say , don 't worry about him . I 'll handle it . How ? I 'm gonna call my father . Ask him to exert some pressure . Last I heard , you and your father weren 't speaking . I guess now I have something to talk with him about . HARPER : I think this circuit 's fried . I don 't know . Maybe you want to come take a look at it . Okay , I 'll be right there . [ Harper yells ] [ Harper panting ] [ Machine whirring ] The gamma 's too high ! Bruce , I can 't stop it ! Harper , get out ! Get out ! [ Machine whirring loudly ] [ Door opening ] - How 's Harper ? - He 's all right . You saved him . I don 't think he 's coming back to the lab for a while , though . I don 't understand how this is possible . You should be dead . They worked . The nanomeds . I feel great. I feel like ... I don 't know , they must have fixed me . They 've killed everything else that they 've come in contact with . Are you sure the doctor checked- - The doctor gave me the full workup . He wants to know where he can get what I 'm taking . I 'm 100 % . More . - What do you mean ? - Remember my bad knee ? Now it 's my good knee . Bruce , this isn 't funny . I was watching you . You were gonna die and I was gonna have to watch you die . I 'm sorry . Really . I am not gonna explode , okay ? [ Sobbing ] Yeah . BRUCE : You should get some rest . I 'm fine , really . I 've never felt better . [ Soft instrumental music ] [ Eerie instrumental music ] [ Soft instrumental music ] [ Dog whimpering ] Your name is not Krenzler . It 's Banner . BRUCE : What ? BANNER : Your name. lt 's Banner . Bruce Banner . BRUCE : How did you get in here ? BANNER : I work here now . In the labs . The late shift . It keeps me close to you . You always work so late yourself with your friend , Miss Ross . No , please . Let me . You 're not well . You 've had a terrible accident . You 're wondering why you 're still alive . You 're thinking there 's something inside . Something different . lnexplicable . I can help you understand , if you let me . If you 'll ... forgive me . Look , mister ... I 'm sure I have nothing to forgive you for ... so perhaps you should leave now . I 'll be fine . BANNER : You must know . You may not want to believe it , but I can see it ... in your eyes . So much like your mother 's . Of course you 're my flesh and blood ... but then you 're something else , too , aren 't you ? My physical son ... but the child of my mind , too . No . You 're lying . My parents died when I was a small boy . No , that 's not true . That 's what they wanted you to believe . The experiments , the accident , all top-secret . They put me away for 30 years . 30 years . Away from you . Away from our work . But they couldn 't keep me forever . I 'm sane . They had to admit it . You see ... everything your extraordinary mind ... has been seeking all these years ... it 's been inside you . Now we will understand it . We will harness it . [ Telephone ringing ] BANNER : Don 't answer. lt 's Miss Ross again . There 's something you need to know about her , Bruce ... something troublesome . BANNER : Let me protect you from her . No . Get out . [ Shouting ] Get out ! Sit ! [ Dogs growling ] We 're gonna have to watch that temper of yours . [ Machine whistles ] [ Dogs whimpering ] [ Rat growling ferociously ] BETTY : Sure you 're okay ? BRUCE : Yeah , just glad to be out of bed . I got a message from my father . He 's coming to see me . BRUCE : Your father ? When ? He lands in about an hour . BETTY : [ Voice-over ] The funny thing is , he called me . BETTY : Hi , Dad . ROSS : Hello , Betty . waitress : Here , ma 'am . BETTY : Thanks . waitress : You 're welcome . Sir . ROSS : Thank you . waitress : You 're welcome . - Look , I 'm gonna get right to it . - lt 's about Glenn , isn 't it ? He 's been snooping around my lab . Glenn noticed some things . He asked me to make some inquiries . BETTY : Are you here to question me ? ROSS : No . We 've turned up some surprising things . This Krenzler you work with ... do you know who he really is ? How much do you actually know about him ? I think the question is ... what is it that you know about him ? I 'm not at liberty to- - Not at liberty to disclose it to me . Right . You know , I think I was hoping ... that maybe this time you just honestly wanted to see me again . You 've got this all wrong , Betty . BETTY : Do I ? ROSS : Yes . I do want to see you . I really wish that I could believe you . [ Dramatic instrumental music ] BANNER : [ Voice-over ] Everything your extraordinary mind ... has been seeking all these years ... it 's been inside you . [ Telephone ringing ] [ Panting ] BRUCE : [ On machine ] This is Dr. Krenzler . Please leave a message and I 'll call you right back . [ Answering machine beeps ] BETTY : Bruce , hey . Are you there ? [ Bruce breathing heavily ] Look , I think I screwed up . My father , it 's like he suspects you of something . [ Thumping ] I was so impatient , like always ... I didn 't hear him out . I don 't know . I just think they 're planning something with the lab . [ Growls ] So call me , okay ? Bye . [ Tense instrumental music swells ] BRUCE : Betty ! [ Growling ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Bruce groaning ] [ Bruce screaming ] [ Roaring ] [ Growling ] GUARD : Dispatch ! We have a 4-15 at the lab ! GUARD : Send the Berkeley P.D. now ! [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Heaving ] [ Siren wailing ] [ Hulk grunting ] [ Hulk roars ] [ Hulk growling ] [ Policeman yelling ] EDlTH : What 's going on ? BANNER : I gotta talk to you . EDlTH : Bruce , stay here . [ Hulk growling angrily ] [ Banner yelping ] [ Hulk roaring ] [ Tense instrumental music swells ] [ Sobbing ] My Bruce . [ Knocking at door ] BETTY : Bruce ? There was some sort of explosion . They wouldn 't let us into the building . I was worried about you . BRUCE : I 'm okay . What happened to you last night ? I had the most vivid dream . It was like being born . Coming up for air . Light hitting my face . Screaming . My heartbeat was like ... boom ... boom ... boom . Were you at the lab ? No . But something ... . And there was that man . The one with the dogs . Who ? That new janitor . He said he was my father . [ Banging on door ] I 'll get it . [ Mouthing ] My father . ROSS : My , my . So this is the young Bruce Banner . Krenzler . I think you left something in your lab last night . ROSS : Mitchell . Escort my daughter outside . I 'll join her shortly . - l 'd rather stay here . - Now , Betty . It 's okay. I 'll be fine . ROSS : Keep him under observation . I 'll be back . - What ? - Your friend in there ... there 's a good chance he 's caught up in some bad business . Unfinished business . I promise you , I 'm going to get to the bottom of it . You have my word I 'll make sure he 's cared for . But as of right now , he 's incommunicado . For the next few days at least ... you 're going to stay away from here , for your own good . [ Solemn instrumental music ] And that 's for the new guy on the night shift ? Great . Thank you. I appreciate it . [ Dog barking ] How unexpected . Please , come in . BETTY : I 'm sorry to show up at your house like this . I came to ask you something ... that I really have no business asking . He told you ? BETTY : He said you talked to him . Please , sit down . Bruce was at the lab last night . He said that you were there , too , but he can 't remember much about it . I need to find out what happened . So you want to know what 's wrong with him . So you can fix him . Cure him . Change him . My father 's with the military . He thinks he 's involved in some kind of threat to national security . Your father , Ross . You brought your father down upon his head . How little you understand , Miss Ross . And how dangerous your ignorance has become . BETTY : I 'm sorry ? BANNER : Don 't be sorry . My son is ... unique . That 's why you can 't relate to him . And because he is unique ... the world will not tolerate his existence , will they ? But you ... you try , don 't you ? And a very beautiful woman like you ... your attentions ... can 't be completely unwanted ... can they ? No . Not with eyes like yours ... watching expectantly , lovingly . But I 'm afraid we 're both too late to help him . There 's nothing I can do for him , or for you . Besides ... he 's made it clear he wants nothing to do with me . His choice . Now if you 'll excuse me , Miss Ross , I have some work to do . And don 't worry about the dogs . You 'll be fine . Just don 't look them in the eyes . Goodbye . ROSS : He gets released , and a month later your lab is destroyed . What a coincidence . So , you 're just not gonna tell me where he is , are you ? BRUCE : How many times must I tell you ... I want to help you , but I don 't know . ROSS : You know who I am , right , Banner ? You 're Betty 's father , a high-ranking general . ROSS : Let 's cut the crap . I 'm the guy who had your father tossed away . I 'll do the same with you if I feel so disposed , you understand ? If you had him tossed away , why ask me ? I don 't remember . I was always told my father was dead . Don 't play with me ! You were four years old when you saw it ! When I saw what ? You were right there ! Who could forget a thing like that ? What ? Some more repressed memories . Just tell me . I 'm sorry , son . You 're an even more screwed-up mess than I thought you 'd be . Till we get to the bottom of this ... your lab has been declared a top-secret military site ... and you won 't get security clearance to get back into it ... or any other lab that 's doing anything more interesting than ... trying to figure out the next generation of herbal hair gel . And one more thing : If you ever come within a thousand yards ... of my daughter again ... I 'll put you away for the rest of your natural life . [ Tense instrumental music ] [ Dogs barking ] BANNER : Dogs ? [ Dogs barking viciously ] Go ! Go get her ! And let nothing stand in your way ! [ Eerie instrumental music ] [ Phone ringing ] [ Phone continues ringing ] BRUCE : Hello ? BANNER : Bruce ? So , they think they can just throw you away , as they did me . [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] What 's wrong with me ? What did you do to me ? BANNER : I had a visit today . A very unwelcome visit . I 'm afraid my hand is being forced . What did you do to me ? BANNER : You so much want to know , don 't you ? But no explanation will serve you half as well as experience . In any case , I still don 't quite understand it myself . If they 'd only let me work in peace . But , of course , my betters would have none of that . BRUCE : So you experimented on yourself , didn 't you ? And passed on to me , what ? BANNER : An alteration . Genetic . A deformity , I guess you could call it that . But an amazing strength , too . And now , finally unleashed , I can harvest it . BRUCE : No . You 'll do no such thing . I 'll isolate it and treat myself . I 'll remove it and kill it before it does any real harm . I bet you and your Betty would love to destroy it . But would you really destroy part of yourself ? I don 't think so . And as for Betty ... I 'm sending her a surprise visit from my four-legged friends . You see , I 've managed to culture some of your very own DNA , Bruce ... and the results are tremendous . They 're unstable , but very powerful . What about my DNA ? BANNER : Let 's just wait and see what Betty makes of the result . No . You 're crazy. I won 't let you . Get your hands off me ! Inside , asshole ! I want to talk to you . BRUCE : My father 's going after Betty . Do you think you can go behind my back ... and get Ross to cut me out ? Listen to me ! Betty 's in trouble ! [ Bruce groaning ] You pathetic freak . BRUCE : Betty 's in danger , I swear to you . If I can state the obvious , something tells me ... you aren 't in much of a position to be making stupid threats to anyone . [ Bruce groaning ] BRUCE : Talbot . TALBOT : Yeah ? - You 're making me angry . - Am I ? [ Knuckles cracking ] [ Talbot panting ] [ Eerie instrumental music ] [ Hulk grunts ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Hulk roaring ] military officer : Open fire ! [ Hulk groaning ] [ Car alarm blaring ] [ Military officer groans ] [ Thumping ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Gentle instrumental music ] [ Whispering ] Bruce ? [ Bushes rustling ] [ Dogs growling ferociously ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Growling ] [ Dogs barking ] [ Dog yelps ] [ Dogs continue growling ] [ Betty screams ] [ Dog whining ] [ Hulk grunts ] [ Engine starting ] [ Dogs barking and growling ] [ Yelling ] [ Snarling ] [ Fast-paced instrumental music ] [ Dogs growling ] [ Screams ] [ Growling ] [ Roaring ] [ Growling ] [ Hulk roars ] [ Betty screams ] [ Hulk breathing heavily ] [ Gentle instrumental music ] [ Bruce panting ] BRUCE : He sent his dogs , didn 't he ? But I killed them . [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Bruce panting ] BETTY : Oh , my God . It must be the nanomeds . It must be the gamma exposure . But we 've never seen any effect like this before . BRUCE : No . Deeper . The gamma just unleashed what was already there . Unleashed what ? Me . It . [ Heaving ] lt 's okay . What were those animals ? My father sent them . He is my father . He wanted me to change . He wanted me to change into that mindless hulk . And why would he want that ? Can you remember anything ? is there anything from when you were changed ? It was like a dream . About what ? Rage . Power . And freedom . [ Birds chirping ] [ Cell phone ringing ] Hello . Sir . Hello . - Dad ? - Betty , are you all right ? I 'm scared . - l need your help . - Where are you ? How are you ? Okay , I guess . I think that somehow your anger is triggering the nanomeds . How could it ? We designed them to respond to physical damage . Emotional damage can manifest physically . Like what ? Serious trauma . Repressed memories . Your father grilled me about something ... that happened to me from early childhood ... that I 'm supposed to remember . BETTY : He did ? BRUCE : It sounded bad ... but I honestly don 't remember . The thing that worries me ... is a physical wound is finite . But with emotions , what 's to say that it won 't just go on and on ... and start a chain reaction ? You know what scares me the most ? is that when it happens ... when it comes over me and I totally lose control ... I like it . [ indistinct beep ] It 's okay , I 've got you. I 'm sorry . You 'll be okay . It 's just to make you sleep . SOLDIER 1 : Target down . SOLDIER 2 : Target secure . BETTY : I 'm gonna take you someplace safe , okay ? Bruce . Bruce . [ Helicopter whirring ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] [ Ethereal female vocals with dramatic music ] [ Severe instrumental music ] [ People talking ] officer : Attention on deck . ROSS : Carry on . BETTY : We 're buried out here in the middle of nowhere . How long are you gonna keep him sedated ? For the rest of his natural life , if I have to . BETTY : You said I could trust you . ROSS : I 'm your father . Trust me to do what I think is right ... not what you think you want . - He is a human being . - He is also something else . Suppose he gets out ... and has one of his little mood swings in a populated area ? Yes , I 'm aware of the potential danger . I 'm also aware that he saved my life . Yeah , from a mutant French poodle . I 'm indebted to him for that . He also put three men in a hospital , and Talbot 's barely walking . - l mean , what do you want me to do ? - l want you to help him ! Why is he such a threat to you ? Because I know what he comes from . He is his father 's son , every last molecule of him . He says he doesn 't know his father . But he 's working in the same , exact goddamn field his father did . So either he 's lying , or it 's something worse ... ROSS : and he 's ... . BETTY : What ? Predestined to follow in his father 's footsteps ? I was going to say " damned . " Of course you were . But I 'm a scientist , and as a scientist ... I believe we can figure this out and he can be helped . I know you do . Look , whether you know or care ... I 've got a lot of pride in what you 've done . But this is too big for you . Look , I know the government thinks they have a weapon on their hands ... otherwise , he 'd be dead by now . They can probe and prod all they want . Meanwhile , let me try to help him . Nobody knows him better than I do . What did David Banner do to him ? SOLDIER 1 : Cover left ! Cover right ! [ Police siren wailing ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] [ Machine hissing ] [ Machine whirring ] [ Banner yells ] [ Eerie instrumental music ] [ Metallic clanking ] [ Creaking ] [ Door opening ] GUARD : What 's happening here ? BANNER : My hand . You see , the strength of my son 's DNA ... combined with nanomed reconstruction ... . You see , I can partake with the essences of all things . I 'm gonna have to ask you to put your hands up , pal , okay ? Nice and easy . Do you really believe that I am separate from you ? [ Banner laughing ] [ Guard yells ] [ Banner grunts ] [ Solemn instrumental music ] Where am I ? You 're home . [ Solemn instrumental music continues ] BETTY : It 's hard to believe we used to live here . I must have seen you or known you . If only I could remember . This is my old house , isn 't it ? [ Tense instrumental music ] Let 's go . Please try . BETTY : What is it ? BRUCE : Nothing . BETTY : Really ? BRUCE : Damn it . Okay , Betty . What do you want to know ? What was in that room ? [ Tense instrumental music ] What are you afraid that I 'll see ? See ? There 's nothing . It 's empty . BETTY : What do you mean I don 't have access to him ? NSA has decided to turn over study of the threat ... to Atheon . But you 're head of the base . I thought you were in charge . ROSS : I don 't set policy . And I still take orders . [ Ross yells ] I can 't believe Talbot would go around me like this ! There 's a lot of powerful people who want in on this ... and money to be made , lots of it . Know the worst part about all this ? When I had David Banner locked up and sent that kid away ... I didn 't give the boy a second thought . He was just collateral damage . He isn 't anymore , is he ? What can I do ? You can go home now . I 'd tell you to go and say goodbye , but I 've already been informed ... that for now all further contact is out of the question . Right . [ Solemn instrumental music ] [ Door opening ] [ Door closing ] Hi , Bruce . How you feeling ? The grub okay here for you ? - What do you want ? - That 's a good question . I need your cells to trigger some chemical distress signals ... so you can turn a little green for me again ... and I can carve off a piece of the real you ... analyze it , patent it and make a fortune . You mind ? I 'll never let you . I 'm not sure you 've got much of a choice . [ Stun gun zapping ] TALBOT : Come on , aren 't you feeling a little angry ? After all , you 've only got me to play with ... now that Betty 's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley . You 're lying . TALBOT : You know , for me , this is a win-win situation . You turn green , all these guys come in and kill you ... and I perform the autopsy . You don 't ... and I mop the floor with you ... and maybe by accident go too far and break your neck . It 's bad science , maybe ... but personally gratifying . TALBOT : Come on , Bruce . Let 's see what you got . Never . [ Thudding ] You know , consciously , you may control it ... but subconsciously , I bet that 's another story . [ Eerie bubbling ] All right , let 's jump-start those brain waves . [ Typing ] [ Beeping ] [ Voices echoing ] My dear Miss Ross , welcome back . There are two guards right outside . You don 't have to worry . I 'm not angry with you , not anymore . What do you want ? It 's over for me now , I know that . And soon it will be over for Bruce . That 's why I 've come to you , to ask you ... if you could persuade your father ... as a man , as a father himself ... that if I turn myself in now , peacefully ... and before he puts me away forever ... that he would let me see my son ... for one last time . Could you do that for me ? It 's out of my father 's hands now . I understand . He 's a puppet now . BANNER : I don 't blame him . BETTY : You shouldn 't . You should blame yourself for what you 've done to your son . And what have I done to my son , Miss Ross ? Nothing . I tried to improve on the limits in myself . Myself , not him . Can you understand ? To improve on nature . My nature . Knowledge of oneself . It 's the only path to the truth ... that gives men the power to go beyond God 's boundaries . You know what 's beyond your boundaries ? Other people . All you 've given Bruce is fear . A fear of life . Fear ? Perhaps , Miss Ross . And loneliness , too . Yes . I feel them both . But I have lived ... completely once . I was so much in love . And she so much wanted a baby ... my baby . I could tell from the moment she conceived ... that it wasn 't a son I had given her ... but something else . A monster , maybe . I should have put a stop to it right then ... but I was curious ... and that was my downfall . And as I watched this tiny life unfold ... I began to imagine the horror of it ... and my curiosity was replaced ... with compassion . But they took away my chance to cure him . Your father threw me out . [ Edith shouting ] I remember that day so well ... every moment , every sensation . Walking into the house ... the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand . I knew I was doing a father 's work ... fulfilling a father 's mercy . EDlTH : David , please stop it ! No ! David , talk to me ! But then she surprised me . [ Edith screaming ] BANNER : It was as if ... she and the knife ... merged . [ Melancholy vocal music ] EDlTH : Go ! BANNER : You cannot imagine ... the unbearable finality of it . And in that one moment ... I took everything that was dear to me ... and transformed it ... into nothing more than a memory . [ Tense instrumental music ] Bingo ! That must be some jumbo nightmare he just had . [ Beeping ] Do it now . Start the enzyme extraction . [ Drilling ] Sir , negative on drill penetration . Damn it , drill him harder . Give me full RPMs . Come on . [ Drilling continues ] [ Dramatic instrumental music ] technician : Should I neutralize ? TALBOT : No ! I can 't do anything with goop . Come on !

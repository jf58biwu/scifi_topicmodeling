 I am sorry . Uh , pardon me . Uh - You 're naked . And you 're not . Uh-uh . No , I - So , either you take yours offi ... or I 'll put mine on . These people are chasing - I , uh - I gotta go . Easy there , Mr. Maintenance Man . I was just recharging my core . It 's like time travel in The Terminator . You 've gotta be in the skin . It 's great for your karma . Karma ? What 's karma ? Um , every good deed comes back to you . Like a boomerang , only you don 't throw it . God , your lifeline - it says you 've been alone . But there are these families coming together . Families ? - What ? - They 're looking for you . And while you search for them , you bring other families together . Keep doing what you 're doing . The good will come back . Oh , thank you . Now I really have to go . Wait , your lifeline , it said something else . You are gonna meet somebody just like you . A kindred spirit . A kindred spirit . Hmm . Um , miss , you dropped your bag . Damn ! " Jenna . " [ Naked Woman 's Voice ] You bring other families together . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . How was your breakfast , Mr. Pritchard ? Sam , you missed some killer pancakes . - My girl here is a budding chef . - [ Chuckles ] Well , don 't thank me . Thank Bisquick . Chuck , you 're in the back today . If anybody needs me , I 'll be putting out fires . Here we go . Another day , another dollar . [ Car Alarm Blaring ] - Sounds like the Buick . - Yeah , well , does numb nuts know ? [ Coughing ] Secondhand smoke . It 's a killer . - [ Ringing ] - Yeah , babe ? You better get in here . - Chuck ! Chuck ? - [ Chuck ] Sam ! I 'm in the trunk ! - Get me outta the trunk ! - Son of a bitch ! Sam ! Hurry up ! I 'm in the trunk ! - Sam , meet Jarod Gray . - You 're late . - What is this ? - It 's a test . Jarod 's with our security company . The same one we 're paying for four-star protection . The kind we 're not getting . How 'd you beat the cameras ? It was very difficult . Sorry about all the bells and whistles ... but the company likes to keep our men frosty . Speaking of which , you might want to get your head of security out of the trunk . It 's getting a little chilly out there . Tell Chuck , now he 's the night watchman , and Jarod 's the new head of security . Get him an advance . Roland , this isn 't smart right now . We got that thing in New Brunswick . You wanna be the night watchman ? Welcome aboard . Jarod , do you know Jenna ? You look ... so familiar . I have one of those faces . [ Miss Parker ] Is my little brother gonna be okay ? Well , his lungs were underdeveloped , but the oxygen should help . That 's my boy . God 's greatest miracle . [ Speaking Gibberish ] The real miracle would be for you and me ... in the shadow of new life to start anew . The Good Book says " turn the other cheek . " I also remember something about " eye for an eye . " Oh , Jarod sent a gift . " Corinthians , 15 : 25 . Even a child is known by his doings . " Ring a bell there , Johnny Dogma ? God bless you all . Willie , our work here is done . [ Sydney ] It 's wrong ? It 's not Corinthians . It 's Proverbs . - Of course Raines had no clue . - Well , how did you know ? Corinthians , 15 : 25 . " For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet . " The operative term being " reign . " - What do you think Jarod 's trying to tell us ? - Raines is no convert . He actually asked me to forgive him . Maybe Raines has found God . Maybe he should have thought of that before he killed my mother . - Find out what that son of a bitch is up to . - Okay . [ Sam ] Hey , look at the new guy hard at work . I called the company about you . I thought only customers got a background check . So , what did old Rudy have to say ? Ah , you 're from Baltimore , an ex-cop . That 's right . Six years Homicide . I got tired of losing ' my collars to the courts . That 's where we gotta change the books . 2,200 gun laws , more than we can enforce , and I 'm the bad guy ? I 'm a salesman . Why would a cop leave a fat pension to take a bullet for somebody ? Why does a salesman need two bodyguards ? Well , we all got enemies , Jarod . Well , maybe you should spread some better karma around . - Karma ? - Yeah . It 's like a boomerang ... only you don 't throw it . - Long day , Mrs. Pritchard ? - Oh , I 'm not Mrs. Pritchard yet . - Roland 's got me on lay away . - We start makin ' wedding plans after Saturday . - The trip to New Brunswick . - Yeah . Gotta see a friend . I 'm gonna want the Buick swept and secured tomorrow morning . Gotta protect my investment . - You talkin ' about me or the rock ? - Ain 't I lucky ? All this and a sense of humor . She means everything to me . You take a bullet for her ... before you even think about takin ' one for me . Well , I certainly hope it doesn 't come to that . [ Car Approaching ] She 's my daughter , Dennis . I have to see her . She 's at St. Charles . - No , I 'm leaving . I 'm leaving . - Not without me , I hope . Jarod . It 's only going to get worse after you 're married . He 's gonna want you watched all the time . Then when you have the little ones - Oh , we won 't be having children . Roland 's choice . - He 's a good man . - I never said he wasn 't . You thought it , though . Everyone does . It 's this business . But Roland 's made a good life for us . It 's like a ... happy ending . You do believe in happy endings , don 't you ? [ Car Approaching ] Get down ! - You okay ? - Yeah . [ Policeman ] Make a list of all those employees that - I 'm supposed to know when you leave the building . Thank you . - [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] - Do you have any idea who did this ? I 'd rather know how they got so close . - It was my fault . I just - I was - - No , it was my fault . I went to get the car . I - I let my guard down . You saved her life . That 's what matters . She 's gonna have my kids someday . [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] Let 's go . [ Jenna 's Voice ] She 's my daughter , Dennis . I have to see her . She 's at St. Charles . Who the hell are you , pal ? [ Priest ] The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . - The Body of Christ . - Amen . - The Body of Christ . - [ Door Opens ] The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . Mr. McGann , your daughter and I have a deal . She 'd better honor it if she knows what 's good for you and the kid . - The Body of Christ . The Body of Christ . - [ Door Opens , Closes ] [ Gunfire ] Uh - Sorry to interrupt . I can come back another time . No , uh , I got work to do . Great . - Keep an eye on the prize , will ya ? - Oh . Sure , no problem . So , uh , thanks again ... for this morning . We 're really gettin our money 's worth . You 're right . We have met . At my house . Agent Dennis Alonzo . He followed me to your daughter 's first Communion rehearsal at St. Charles . He seems to be strong-arming your father . Why ? Is he trying to get you to testify against your fiance or something ? Look , I can protect you . And I can help you get your family back . But you 're going to have to trust me . You 're wrong , Mr. Gray . I can 't trust anyone . You have no idea what you 're getting into . " Operation Fat Cat . Objective : Secure evidence on Roland Pritchard . Owns 10 tristate gun shops , money laundering , illegal files and - " - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm an ex-cop . And I 'm someone who can help you get your daughter back . Tell me she 's okay . All right , I 'm gonna finish this assignment . - Just tell me that she 's okay . - Assignment ? Wait a minute . You 're A.T.F. Oh , my God . How long have you been undercover ? Twelve months , 13 days . Twelve months ? You 've been apart from your daughter for over a year ? I miss my little girl . # [ Rap ] [ Police Siren Wailing ] - This better be good . - Okay . The card Jarod sent with the gift - the chapter and the verse numbers were a code for Raines 's computer . Every day for the last six months , Raines has been meeting with that guy . Oh , my God . Giuseppe . - You know him ? - Junior year of high school . Rome . Look at him . You guys were like a thing or something ? He was my date for the spring formal . He tried to get to third base in the front seat of his father 's Ferrari . I broke his finger . Boy , he is still a biscuit . You mean biscotti , don 't you ? [ Man ] Look up ! Look up ! Look up ! Shoot ! # [ Rap ] Parker , is that you ? Giuseppe . You 're looking very well . You too . Very well . Give me a moment , will ya ? How 's the finger ? Oh , it 's-it 's still bent . Yeah , I feel bad about that . Well , I have , uh , changed a lot since then . Yes , you have . This all started when we traced some guns back to one of Roland 's shops . They 'd been used in a school shooting . The operation was supposed to take three months , tops . That snowballed into a year . I started out as , uh , Roland 's assistant . And then one day he asked me out . A.T.F .. said , " Couldn 't hurt . " A cup of coffee turns into an evening . [ Sighs ] Alonzo forced me to go with it . The next thing I know , I 'm wearing an engagement ring . Have you ever been undercover , Jarod ? Once or twice . She has your eyes . - You 've seen her ? - Yes . Her and your father . They both look well , considering . How long has it been since you saw them ? Two months . I used to go every week ... but , uh , Alonzo put a stop to that . Said Roland was getting too close . And what about you ? Were you getting too close ? [ Shouting ] You think I 'm enjoying this ? Look , I know Cassie needs me , but I can 't walk ! And what if Roland finds out about her ? Her father 's gone . She can 't lose another parent . Jenna , just keep your voice down . I understand . They 've moved Cass and my dad , and Alonzo won 't let me see them . Whatever it takes to get the fat cat . Don 't you have enough on Pritchard to put him away ? Roland 's not the target . We still don 't know who all this money washing 's for . [ Sighs ] - We meet him in two days . - The old friend in New Brunswick . Do me a favor . Keep this . It belonged to my mother . I want Cassie to have that ... if , uh ... things don 't work out . Everything will work out . And then what ? I don 't know who I am anymore , Jarod . People change . We used to call you " Shifty G. " It 's no wonder that you 're Raines 's priest . This is about William ? Of course . Jarod said you 'd come . You know Jarod ? Father Jarod is the bishop 's favorite envoy . And Mr. Raines is studying to be a deacon . That 's why he 's meeting with you . No . Daily confession . William lives with many demons . But he is also a child ofGod . He will be granted absolution ... no matter what his sins . Including murder ? He feels very badly about Catherine 's death ... and regrets profoundly the pain it caused her daughter . What other lies did he tell you ? I can 't betray what he told me in confession . However , Jarod was curious about something ... Mr. Raines told his associate in the parking lot . Something about the ... Veritas Project . Veritas . Truth . Overheard in the parking lot . Is that yourway of betraying a confession ? I was wrong about you . You 're worse than Raines . So full of anger . That 's my religion . [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] Uh , I 'll be right up . I 'm gonna make a phone call . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - This is Alonzo . - So ... how do I look ? So you 're an ex-cop , Detective Jarod Gray . Six years Baltimore P.D. That give you some right to jeopardize my operation ? You 're doin ' a fine job . I overheard Jenna yelling atyou on your cell phone . - You 're lucky it was me that overheard and not Pritchard . - Jen 's a little frayed now . Who wouldn 't be ? You 've taken her family , you 're practically blackmailing her . Why don 't you admit it ? You 're in over your head . You think I wanted this ? These attacks on Pritchard are gettin ' worse . - I 've noticed . Who 's tryin ' to kill him ? - You tell me . Obviously you 've read my file . You know that I was a good cop and I 'm here to help . - Now , who is tryin ' to kill him ? - The best we can figure it 's a client . Pritchard 's skimming from the people he 's laundering money for . - So he 's more dangerous than I thought he was . - You have no idea . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Who the hell are you , anyway ? I 'm somebody who 's trying to make sure that Agent McGann doesn 't end up dead . About a year ago , right after Jen started workin ' undercover here ... we found one of Pritchard 's gun suppliers dead in the woods , double tap at the chest . Now , word was he crossed Pritchard , but we never found a weapon to match ballistics . So , you weren 't able to pin the murder on Pritchard . - No . - And now you 're holding Agent McGann 's daughter ? We 're not holding her . We 're protecting her . By making her mother stay with a killer ? Jen may be in deep , but she 's the best agent I know . - Three more days , she 'll get us what we need . - Us ... or you ? Excuse me , Mr. McGann ? Agent Jarod Gray , A.T.F. I came down here to tell you that your daughter will be home soon . Just in time for Cassie 's first Communion , right ? I don 't believe A.T.F. lies anymore . That 's not a lie , sir . It 's a promise . Cassie . Mr. Gray here works with your mother . My mommy catches bad guys . Yes , Cassie , she does . She asked me to come down here ... to tell you that she misses you very much , and she 'll see you soon . I see her at night , in my dreams . But it 's not the same . Cassie , your mom asked me to give you this . She wants you to take very good care of it . Look at that , kiddo . That was your grandma 's ring . Mommy hasn 't come in a long time . Does she not wanna see us ? Of course she does , Cassie . I tell you what . You save a seat for her at your Communion . That 's a mighty big promise you 're making . [ Jarod ] She 'll be here . [ Gunfire ] Jenna , Pritchard , get down ! [ Gunshot ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] Strike me down now , Lord . Willie . Miss Parker . This saintly routine is wearin ' kind of thin , don 't you think , Deacon ? You 've been talking to my priest . Please . Sit . We 've been down a dark road , you and I. Our footprints side-by-side . But at times ... there was only one set . That was when I carried you . Really ? I thought that was when you were off killing my mother . Believe what you must believe , Miss Parker . But find it in your heart to forgive me . It will give you inner peace . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] What ? - Where are you ? - You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . This Veritas thing Raines and Willie were talking about . It 's an experimental airborne toxin ... developed by the Centre and shelved in the ' 80s . - Raines is resurrecting it . - Some people can 't resist temptation . - You know the one about " thou shall not covet " ? - Of course . That 's one commandment you don 't want to break . - Thanking you is gettin ' to be a habit . - Just doing my job . - What 's the word on the gunman ? - Muretta and I gotta talk to the cops . You okay ? That look in your eyes , it 's genuine concern for him . Emotional assimilation . The psychological side effect of prolonged undercover work . You are an expert . Just don 't forget that the man you 're engaged to is a killer . Roland 's done a lot of terrible things , but he 's no killer . - Alonzo didn 't tell you , did he ? - Tell me what ? He 's unbelievable . Jarod ? Alonzo has left out a small detail . Since he put that ring on your finger , Pritchard killed a gun supplier . - What ? - Stay focused or get out . Okay , uh - Let 's just say that he is a killer . That 's all the more reason for me to stay under . I don 't want anything to happen to my little girl . It 's just ... one more night , unless , of course , you know ... where the meeting is in New Brunswick . Your fiance keeps that a secret . Then again , I know where he keeps those . [ Beeps ] [ Beeps ] [ Beeps ] [ Beeping ] Looks like your cover 's blown , Agent McGann . This is what Raines was up to . Veritas was tested here in the early ' 80s . If this is a dead end , I 'm gonna track down Father Giuseppe and break his other nine digits . It might be kind of fun , actually . - More of that forbidden priest thing , huh ? - [ Chuckles ] Just open the door . The door seems to be pressurized or something . I got it . [ Coughs ] There 's some kind of gas ! Broots ! Broots ! Oh , my God ! Broots ! Broots ! [ Coughs ] Canary . Canary in a coal mine . Canary . Canary in a coal mine ? [ Coughing Continues ] Broots , I want you to find out anything else you can about how this gas could possibly be used . I 'm gonna go find Father Giuseppe . Have Sydney take a look at you . - Why didn 't you tell her ? - Certain details are kept from an agent . Stop making excuses . You crossed the line . - The man is a killer ! - The agent could be compromised ! - The agent was compromised ! - What ? I found Jenna 's personnel file in Pritchard 's gun safe . Listen to me . We don 't make a move until Pritchard makes a move . What if he makes a move on Jenna ? You prepared to dredge your agent up from the Hudson ? - She knows the risks . - What did you just say ? - It 's the job ! - Is making her daughter an orphan part of the job too ? We 'll watch Pritchard . He won 't take a dump without us knowing . He won 't do anything . You 'd better pray that he doesn 't . You 're the bodyguard ! Protect her ! Those mandatory trigger locks , they 're a bitch , aren 't they ? They 're not mandatory yet . I got no illusions about what I do , Jarod . Let me tell you somethin ' . When some pissed-off day trader ... decides to take an A.K. to his brokerage firm ... I 'm not standin ' there handing ' him bullets either . But what if he needs some money laundered ? Come again ? I like to know who I 'm protecting . Sometimes knowledge is not power . Well , in my case , it is . Jenna isn 't exactly who she says she is . She 's A.T.F. - Who have you told about this ? - Nobody . Looks like now you 're gonna need some help calling off your engagement . Let 's just say I have some experience in this arena . No . I meant what I said . You take a bullet for her . - Jen is my future . - Are you tellin ' me you 're in love with her ? Let 's just say I 'm in love with what she can give me - a get-out-of-jail-free card . So , tonight , when we 're safe , Jenna radios her boss and I give them the fat cat ... and we get a little beach house in a sexy , non-extradition country . - If she follows the plan . - She will . A Colt 1911 " A. " It can be very convincing . But I got somethin ' better than that . Jen 's daughter . Cute kid , huh ? Like I said , Jarod , I got no illusions about what I do . [ Giuseppe ] You know how I stand on this . [ Miss Parker ] Raines told me what he 's doing with the Veritas gas . - He confessed ! - He said nothing about that . He 's a psychotic killer . And he 's up to something horrific . - Do you define all men by their sins ? - Only the bad ones . Only the ones that take a girl in the Basilica de Roma and cop a feel . That 's not true and you know it . This isn 't about two teenagers groping in a basilica . - Besides , it was you who came on to me . - [ Scoffs ] - I rejected you . The pain of that rejection lives inside you . - Not true . It is true , Parker . You 've rewritten history . Create an enemy in your mind because that 's what you needed to survive . Anger is your religion . And you need enemies like me and Mr. Raines to fuel that distorted faith . If thy brother trespass against you , rebuke him . And if he repent , forgive him . - He killed my mother . - If he trespassed against thee ... - He has presided over every moment of pain in my life . - seven times in a day ... - He 's a monster ! - thou shalt forgive him ! And you are not his priest . You 're his coconspirator ! Forgive yourself , Parker . If you don 't , you 'll surely be dammed to a life of eternal suffering . God forgives . I don 't . [ Bell Tolling ] [ Bell Tolling ] [ Jarod ] You can 't put your faith in him . - He wouldn 't hurt her . - You can 't take that chance . - I don 't have a choice ! I have to go with him tonight . - Jen , listen to - No . I have to finish this ... and know that son of a bitch is behind bars . It 's the only way that Cassie can be safe . You can 't talk me out of this . - Where 's Jarod ? - I sent him home . Why ? Roll , baby . I got a confession to make . Jen ! You have to trust me . Don 't do this . All right , somebody tell me what the hell is goin ' on . - I know you know who I am . - Don 't tell him anything ! Stop ! I 'll do what you ask . I 'll help you out of the country . Just don 't hurt my daughter . - Don 't go with him . - Shut up ! You back off . No matter what he says , you can 't believe him ! He 's still going to kill your daughter ! I would never kill a little girl . [ Gasping ] [ Groaning ] Jarod , I 'm sorry . Get in the car . You know what . It 's funny . But I actually did fall in love with you , in a strange way . Then you had to tear my heart out . But I guess you made the right choice . Oh , she did . You missed me ! You know , I heard this song once that happiness was a warm gun . Yes , it is . You needa cooling-down period . [ Grunting ] Shooting an ex-cop . Not a very smart idea . Especially when he 's put blanks in your clip . You see , there 's this open case over at the A. T.F .. Something about a gun supplier found shot to death in the woods . They never could make a ballistics match . Or find the killer . Now they will . [ Jenna ] Want to know something funny ? I had feelings for you . But you had to go ... and threaten my little girl . Bad decision . Karma . Ain 't it a bitch ? - This is Alonzo . Over . - [ Jarod Over Radio ] Alonzo . - Jarod , you bastard , what have you done with Jenna ? - She 's safe and sound . - Now , did you ever get the fat cat ? - We got him . - But no Pritchard . - Check the third alley off of 18th Street . Oh , and , uh , I left a little present for you under your seat . [ Broots ] We tracked down some of the properties of the gas that Raines was developing . Veritas relaxes the lungs to the point where they can no longer take in oxygen . In small doses , it 's not even lethal . I 'm sure Raines skipped that part . Weak lungs is one of the theories behind sudden infant death syndrome . Oh , my God . The baby . [ Speaking Gibberish ] Stop ! Get away from him ! I know what you 're up to with the Veritas . I don 't think you do . A diluted version of Veritas gas helped me loosen baby Parker 's lungs . [ Fussing ] He 's free of this ball and chain . I wish I could say the same for myself . I saw the testing room . There are many villains in the Centre , Miss Parker . Iknow you need them to survive . But I can 't be your enemy anymore . [ Priest ] This is the Lamb of God who takes awaythe sins of the world . Happy are we who are called to the Lord 's Supper . - The Body of Christ . - [ Girl ] Amen . - The Body of Christ . - [ Girl # 2 ] Amen . - The Body of Christ . - [ Girl # 3 ] Amen . - The Body of Christ . - Amen . - The Body of Christ . - [ Girl # 4 ] Amen . May Almighty God bless you , the Father ... the Son , and the Holy Spirit . The mass has ended . Let us go in peace to always love and serve the Lord . Look at your mother . - You got the bad guy ? - We got him . Now let 's go home .

 Hello , John . Oh , at last . At last . Yes ? Sorry to wake you , sir , but I think we 've finally done it . On my way . Crichton . Pilot , can we keep going ? We can do anything if the others want to , but ... Well , then , can we turn around ? I am sick of running to the ends of the fekik just because he 's got a balliun up his butt . I have explained this to you . You have explained it to all of us . Over and over and over . The deep space variances we encountered indicate that we could ... We could be somewhere near a wormhole . The variances could also indicate a trillion other possibilities none of which have anything to do with wormholes . Guys , I know that you have been patient . Oh , no more . I 've had it up to parsac 's bow with patience . Pip , no , Chia ... come on . Chiana , don 't , don 't , don 't . Pilot , get us out of here . Don 't ! Look , remember the ship in the wormhole ? I saw the Three Stooges . The broadcast . I 'm with Miss Monochrome . Let 's just get the frell out of here . D , come on , man . Look , it 's the Stooges . I gotta , I gotta ... Look , you know , it 's Earth , it 's home . I know , I 'm a little ... a little obsessive , but I gotta . John , we have been searching for ten solar days . I mean , come on , enough is enough . You saw that broadcast through a wormhole , and you know as well as I do your home could be anywhere . Hmm . Pilot , you game to continue ? I 'm afraid the others would object . But there 's something else now , too . What ? Moya 's approaching an electromagnetic cluster . All her scans indicate it 's benign , but ... That was the cluster , right ? We just passed through it . Pilot , are we okay ? Everything seems fine . Oh , boy . Pilot , there 's something in ... Is anybody having any ... problems ? My name is John Crichton ... I 'm lost ... an astronaut . I got shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I 'm trying to stay alive ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners . My friends . If you can hear me ... Beware . If I make it back ... Will they follow ? If I open the door ... Are you ready ? Earth is unprepared ... Helpless , for the nightmares I 've seen . Or should I stay ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you will never know the wonders I 've seen . D 'Argo ? Chiana , where are you ? Pilot ! What 's the matter , Crichton ? Light ... came in here . Moya 's senses registered nothing . Oh , look , right after the cluster I said that ... that light it ... Abbot ! Crichton ! Hey , what 's the matter ? - Chiana . You okay ? You all right ? - Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine , yeah , yeah . You look terrible . What 's the matter ? I ... I ... the light that came into Moya . It went through me , and ... and it just ... like ... I bled . Boom , boom ... I bled . Am I cut ? - Let me see . Am I cut ? - No , there 's nothing there . You sure ? Oh , yeah ! Are you sure you bled ? Yes , I bled ! You don 't make some ... Like a ... it was like a lake of blood . It was biblical . - Uh , Crichton , you 've barely eaten or slept in ten solar days . Maybe you imagined it . Nobody imagines things like this . Okay . - Here . Right here . What ? What am I supposed to be looking at ? There was blood , blood . It was right here . Pilot , did you ... did you register an electric surge down here ? Nothing . I told Crichton that . What , what do you , what are you looking at ? Do you think I 'm making this up ? All right . Go eat . And then go bathe , because you stink . Hold still . Hold still , and quit your whining . You know you 've got my blood in here . Can 't have vaporized it all . Nothing . Nothing , nothing , nothing . Oh ... Oh , God ... Oh my God ! What 's happening to me must have to do with that cluster we passed through . The ... the ... the light thing . Crichton , I 've told you , all scans indicate the cluster was harmless . It was not harmless . Run the scan again . Look , look , I-I ... maybe I imagined the light thing , but I bled . And I have the blood to prove it . And I 'm not cut anywhere . There could be another explanation for what 's happening . When Kaavork duplicated you on the diseased Leviathan perhaps he ... You think maybe Kaavork did something to me , that my body is breaking down ? I 'm sorry , but it is possible . What is going on ? My chamber is boiling hot . This place is leaking . Well , Pilot says he 's having some troubles with the internals . He says he 's working on it . - Crichton ... calm down . You 're tired . It could all turn out to be nothing . Nothing ? I am bleeding and I have no wounds . So I 'm either St. John of the Uncharted Territories or there 's something very , very wrong with me . Well , what would you like us to do ? I want all of you to watch me , in case I have another episode , a bleed , whatever you call it . I 'm sorry . As much fun as that sounds , I don 't think so . Pip , stop okay ? You know , look , I thought that I was the real me and that that other guy , the guy on Talyn , that he 's the clone . But I 'm starting to think maybe I 'm the photocopy . Crichton , this has nothing to do with the split . Just sleep . You 'll be fine . No , I 'm not imagining this . Watch me , please . All right , John . Sit down , in fact ... ah-ah-ah ! Girls , we will all ... sit down and watch John . Off we go . What if I have to piss ? Well , then , we will all urinate together . You promise ? Ugh ! You having fun yet ? Galaxies of it . Can we go now ? No . Sorry , but I 'm not gonna sit here ... - No ! There 's water everywhere . Where 'd that come from ? That bucket 's overflowing already ? Oh , yeah , see ? See , see , see , I saw it . I told you . Strange things are happening . I had this DRD record us . He 's going to put it on the clamshell . You having fun yet ? Galaxies of it . What 's going on ? We 're not moving . Can we go now ? No . Sorry , but I 'm not gonna sit here ... - No ! What happened to us ? There 's water everywhere . Where 'd that come from ? All scans indicate normal . Right , well , let 's seek official approval , shall we ? Sir , the Prowler retained its integrity on the last six reentries . No gravitational distortions ? - No . Nothing . Electronics , bio-mass indicators all within acceptable parameters . And now you want to send a Peacekeeper ? He has oscillation ratings . With respect , Scorpius , bio-mass reentry will work . Your indecision is wasting time . What he means , sir ... the wormhole is degenerating , and stabilization has been unsuccessful so far . If we don 't complete our trial soon , it will delay us . To find another wormhole . So , can we please get started ? You demanded my transfer here so I could master wormholes and create the weapon you desire . You did not transfer me here to wait for your permission as if you were my mother . It is now time to proceed with biological trials . Right , son . Well , deploy him . Clear the hangar area . Stand by for manual Prowler launch . Best I can figure , we were out for about half an arn . How could that be ? Well , perhaps Moya lost atmospheric pressure and we blacked out and lost time . We are doing a lot more than just losing time . I think , though I 'm not sure ... but I think I may have lost time earlier . Before I changed into this I was running a soak , and the water was warm . Instantaneously , it was cold . Why didn 't you tell us this ? Well , I just thought it was a heating coil malfunction . Anything strange happen to you guys ? I live on this ship . Something strang always happens . Not like spasming . Before my first episode , I saw some kind of light . Moya passed through an electromagnetic cluster . Now , Pilot says it 's harmless , but it 's got to be related . Pilot , have you run the long-range re-scan on that cluster yet ? Pilot ! Pilot ! You okay ? Where are the lights ? Pilot ? - Is he breathing ? I don 't know . - Oh , hezmana , he stinks ! What happened to us has happened to Pilot , too . Does anybody know how to check his pulse ? It 's behind the neck , in between the vertebrae . Right . Get back . Get back ! Get back ! Apologies . But you must stay back . For one of you , judgment starts now . Judgment ? What the hell are you talking about ? Pilot 's gone . I am in him now . Apologies . Tried to taste without your knowing . Taste ? But you discovered . Back , back ! Don 't know how to control this body . This ship ... yet . Must slow down . This body cannot contain me . Then get out of it . Please , I will not harm your Pilot . I can stay in him a short time to find the diseased energy rider . My group probes could not detect who it occupies . What 's an energy rider ? We live in clusters . When you passed through ours a diseased rider escaped on your ship . Are you saying there 's a diseased alien in one of us ? Yes . I must taste you , alone now , to find it . What the fek are you talking about ? What is he talking about ? Shoot him . Shoot him now . You 're the warrior , shoot him now . All right , with what ? My nose ? Shoot him . - No , it 's Pilot . We 're not gonna shoot him . Why not ? - Fek up , Jool . First law in my world , don 't hurt the body . Rider , I am not here to destroy you . Reveal yourself . I do not wish to hurt these others . Must calm this Pilot . Do not try to ambush me . I will know ! Does anyone know what 's going on here ? I don 't know . You feel any different ? What do you mean , " different ? " Different , like I might have a diseased alien in me , different ? No , I don 't feel like that . Actually , now that you mention it , I 've been feeling a little angry . That 's normal for you . Jool , wrong way . Why do you believe a word that thing inside Pilot 's saying ? I don 't have to believe it , Chiana . But something made me bleed , and it made all of us shake like a sheep in Arkansas . Well , I think I should just grab my Qualta Rifle stick it in its mouth and say " Hey , get out of Pilot . " And what are you gonna do if it says no ? Run a full vessel scan . See if we have control of anything on board . I hate to point out the obvious , but if something is inside us , I think it likely , since you had the first symptoms , that you 're the infected . Kiss my butt . If I 'm Linda Blair , why am I telling you guys anything ? Well , it 'd be the smart thing to do if later you need to appear innocent . I 'm not that smart . I thought of that . I still think you 're the best candidate . Right . Opinion noted . Leave me alone . D 'Argo , what you got ? Nothing . I can 't get control of anything . Me , either . That damn thing in Pilot left us with squat . You know , it is possible that we 're fine , and Pilot 's the only infected one . Why ? What could it possibly want ? I don 't know , maybe he 's crazy . Sounds feked to me . I think we should all get a Transport Pod out of here , now . Weren 't you listening ? We have no control . If that thing in Pilot doesn 't want you to leave , you 're not leaving . Look at the lights . Look at the dripping water . That thing is not controlling everything . Maybe I 'll get lucky . Good luck . Unified plan , as always . Auto-retrieval and bio-fluctuations appear normal . Then why is your pilot not responding to our comms ? I suspect an antenna burnout . Vessel integrity is definitely intact . Well , open it . Your pilot 's integrity is , well ... It is definitely not intact . There must be a malfunction in the negative shield deployment . This will never happen again . Oh , it 'll happen once more . Instructor Drillic will pilot the next trial . Wash out the Prowler for immediate deployment . Scorpius , I am not flying the next trial . I am afraid that , uh ... Braca will insist . Drillic is project leader . He is ... And what is your name ? Strappa , Co-Kura Strappa . Strappa . Well , Strappa , you are now project leader . And perhaps , now that you know what to expect , you can discover exactly what went wrong here . Yes ? Scorpius , we had to run Sebacean trials . It was time . Don 't ... don 't send me . Scorpius ! Scorpius . - All right , D. - We 'll try it your way . Be cool . Luxan , you cannot ambush me . I have my weapon pointed at your face . I don 't think I 'm doing too badly . Now , I would like to see the real Pilot . I am trying to save you pain . I wish you would believe that , but since you ask ... D 'Argo ! Crichton ! He 's not lying . There 's a creature in one of you . Please , get it out . Get it out ! Please . Help me find the rider . The longer it remains in one of you the more damage it will do . Why don 't you jump into us like you do Pilot , find it yourself ? The Rider is a child . It can possess you . If I did , my power would destroy you . And what did it do ? Why do you want it so bad ? This Rider stays too long and diseases minds . Gives only desire and despair . How do we know which one of us it 's in ? Rider had to burrow in quickly . It will not know details of the heart , sire , siblings . Your private world . Lolan was my wife , Jothee was my son . He slept with Chiana , who was my fiancée . My dad 's name was Jack , my dog 's name was Hubble . I lost my virginity to Karen Shaw in the back of a four-by . How old were you ? Sixteen . I was seven . Chiana , what 's your brother 's name ? You know what my brother 's name was . Just answer the question . Ah , you were right . I couldn 't even open a Transport Pod to see if ... What 's going on ? Boys are playing detective . What , that thing in Pilot tell you to do this ? You don 't know the answer , do you ? Nerri . Okay , good . Good with the Nerri . Now , question two . Did you or did you not kill Sakis ? His name was Salis . And you don 't even know if I killed him . Yeah , well , you stay there . What are you doing ? That creature in Pilot says whichever of us is infected won 't know personal details . None of you know anything personal about me . I could make everything up , I could lie . Well , we know how you got frozen in the Stasis Chamber . Tell us . And the truth . I , uh ... I discovered a Noatian gem mine . The guards caught me . They sold me to Grunchlk . End of pathetic story . And what about your cousins ? How 'd they get frozen ? They waited in the village for me . They got sick and ... That is not what you told us before . I was lying before ! I 'm sorry , Princess . I think you just elected yourself most likely . Have you found the infected ? Yep . Take Jool . - Shut up , Chi . No , we haven 't found that thing yet . Apologies . Must begin now . Do you suspect this female ? No , they don 't ! No , no , we need more time . I 'll try not to take long . John , we cannot let them take Jool . I know , I ... Hey , just don 't take anybody yet . We don 't ... - I 'll try not to hurt ... much . Stop , no ! What are you doing ? Stop ! Let her go ! Pilot ! Whoever you are ! Stop now ! Did you get it ? Did you get that thing out of her ? No , it is well hidden . I have not found my rider . Apologies . Stuff the apologies , fekik . Is it in her or not ? I am not certain . It could still be in this female or in one of you . I 'm afraid I must taste each of you in turn . This is all the rider 's fault . Is she all right ? She 's breathing . D 'Argo , come on . I got an idea . No . I 'm coming with you . Uh-uh . Chiana , somebody has to stay with Jool . No , no , no , not me . Not this time . All right , you two go . I 'll stay here . We 're gonna have a little chat . Moya must know that there 's something seriously wrong with Pilot . We 've gotta get that thing out of him . Does she have any idea how we can do that ? You understand any of this ? No . All right , we don 't understand the R2-D2 crap . We 're going to use the Star Trek system . One blink for yes , two blinks for no . You understand ? Good . Will you help ? Where are we ? Below the Neural Cluster . I heard Pilot once say there 's a chamber down here where he has no sense receptors . Kind of like the human brain . Pilot can 't feel anything . Can 't find us down here . Starburst chamber . This must be where the energy of Starburst first coalesces . From in here , can we get that thing out of Pilot ? I don 't know . What the hell is that ? You think it wants us to push something ? You 're asking the wrong cowboy . Where 'd DRD Pike go ? Ah , forget about it . Hey , yo , Chiana . Don-don 't touch anything . Don 't be a tralk . It wouldn 't have brought us down here for no reason . Hey Moya , you want us to push this ? Chiana , don 't push any buttons ... Turn it off . Turn it off . How ? ! Hit the button again ! Was that a Starburst blast ? No , if it was Starburst we 'd be dead . Moya must have shut it down . Why would Moya want us down here for this ? I have no idea , unless ... Unless what ? Uh , um ... Unless I get some more schematics , I don 't know . You know . Know ? Know what ? You saw . Saw ... Saw me . Had to show ... gla-glad to show ... Mm-mm ... So good . Feels good . Chi , what the hell are you doing ? Taste ... taste ... Love to try this body . Okay , whatever you are , you can get the hell off of me . This body wants you . Fear ... no fear of me . Tallip , he lies . Lies . Tallip 's that thing in Pilot ? Heard him say I hurt this body . Not true . Love this tight body . Oh , oh yeah , yeah , we all love this body . Okay , you sit . We 'll sip later . I 'll call you . You 're in the book , right ? Tallip wants to kill me . That 's why I hide . I hide when your ship pass . Mistake . Only four here . Only four . Not take long to find me . Not ... not long . Tallip ? Tallip likes pain . After me , he kill ... you . Tallip said that if you stay in Chiana , you 're going to kill her . Tallip lies . I not lie . Oh ! Oh ! Good god ! Oh ! Whoa ! What 'd you just do to me ? Sip . Sip . Inspire . Tallip is pain . Not me . Okay , that ... that ... that 's good . But this doesn 't prove anything . Won 't hurt your friend . Just ... must hide . Get me away to where there are many . Tallip not find if there are many . Please ? Fine . I 'll , uh , talk to my friends . You ... you 're gonna ... you 're gonna stay here . You 're , you 're safe here . No . How I know ? Trust you ? You don 't . But I 'm a guy . I 'll probably be back in 15 minutes . Oh , that 's unnatural . Good God ! Ah ... You 're busy . I 'll come back later , sir . - Braca . No , no , no . Come in . Come in . Braca . Why is it that Crichton , a human , can survive wormhole reentry , and the Sebacean cannot ? Well , perhaps there 's some information still hidden in the chip we took from Crichton 's brain . Perhaps . Do you know why you 're my second in command , Braca ? No , sir . Because you don 't ask questions . But have you ever asked yourself , Braca , why do they give us so much reign ? Hmmm ? Chasing Crichton ? Researching wormholes ? Well like you said , sir , I don 't question High Command . Would it surprise you to learn that the Scarrans are planning a massive assault against us , but they haven 't ? Because ... because they fear our hidden wormhole weapons . We have no hidden weapons . We lied . And I think the Scarrans are beginning to suspect that . High Command reports that they 've been massing armies . My latest estimates , Scarran warriors outnumber Peacekeeper soldiers ... ten to one . But if and when they attack , we will lose , Braca . Unless we harness a superior weapon . Yes . Wormhole technology . Without it ... the Sebacean race will be overrun . Thousands of cycles of history , gone . There 's so little time . Sometimes I feel ... it is already inevitable . All right , we gotta talk . You led me in the Starburst chamber to find that thing in Chiana , didn 't you ? Yes . Does Moya want me to reveal it to Tallip ? And what if Tallip is lying ? Whoa , whoa ! Hey , whoa , whoa ! Calm , calm down ! I know you 're freaking out about Pilot , but if that thing in Chiana 's not diseased , does Moya still want me to betray it ? Okay . If it touches me again , D 'Argo , I will die ! Found the energy rider . It 's in Chiana . She 's hiding in the Starburst chamber . Tell Pilot and get that thing off Moya now ! It might be a little more complicated than that . I sense your anger . I did warn you . Tasting would be painful . We 've hidden the rider , and you 'll never find it . So let 's make a deal . you turn the ship around , head back to your cluster , we 'll tell you where the rider is and you two can play " Pick the friendly alien in your neighborhood . " How do I know one of you is not infected ? That this is not the rider 's plan ? It 's not , believe me . This plan is so bad , it has to be ours . Okay . I choose . I not ... not leaving . No . No . Crichton thought you were safe here . But he was wrong . What 's going on ? " What 's going on ? " Get up ! Why the pulse pistol , Princess ? Crichton told us you 're the one . Now get up ! Okay , I 'm the one . I 'm the one . - Get up ! Get up ! Move ! Okay , okay , y-you right . No Chi . Puff ! They can 't fool Jool . Too , too smart . Your human must say I 'm not bad . Not , not bad . Jool , what are you doing ? I 'm taking her to Pilot . Look , that demon 's got D 'Argo ... Out of my way ! - Hey , hey ! Hey , hey , there 's no need to ... No more talk ! Let me go . Tiny brains ... no more talk . Let me go , please . - They last forever . Pretty please ? - I give them ... Please let go . Okay , so everything Tallip said about you is true . Chaos . Mmm ... Desire . They stay . Hey , cupcake . Have you noticed the lights ? They 're not pulsing anymore . Your friend must be done with D 'Argo . Tallip , take the rider but don 't hurt Chiana . Tallip ? ! Tallip , you 're killing her ! Tallip ! Crichton , she 's alive . The thing 's out of her . She 's alive . Is that it ? You finished ? Yes . I have killed the rider . That 's what it said you wanted to do . Turn Moya around , head back to your cluster and leave us the hell alone . No , human . I love this now . I have mastered this body and your ship . And now I 'm going to stay . I thought you couldn 't stay in Pilot . I never knew it could be like this . So good . The rider was right . It is perfect to stay too long . Perfect ... Moya will never accept you . Moya will do what I command . Now go . Take the Luxan with you . So I can enjoy this . Thought I might find you here . Moya , you were right . I should have given the rider , to Pilot when you said but I still think he would have screwed us . Don 't you ? Okay . I got a new plan . It 's a better plan , but I need your help . Okay ? Is she okay ? - Yeah . All right , I need you to go to the Neural Cluster , Tier Seven . D 'Argo 's waiting there for you . What 's happening ? - Just go ! And the less said the better . D 'Argo 'll tell you what to do . Pip , I need your help . Can you walk ? No . No ? Oh , God ! Moya is going to try and redirect some Starburst energy into the Den . Won 't that kill Pilot ? Not if we time it right . We get the demon out , we kill it , and Pilot lives . So that the only plan we got ? That 's it . Okay , what do you want me to do ? All right . D 'Argo and Jool are going to spook the thing . I 'm going to press an override panel in Pilot 's Den . I 'm gonna comm you . You join these two circuits together . DRD Pike 's gonna do the same over there . You remember what happened here last time , don 't ya ? I 'm not talking about the sex thing . That was great , but I 'm not talking about it . Starburst blast . Right . Well , this one 's gonna be a gazillion times stronger , Chiana . So you got ten microts to get your ass out of here . Plenty of time . Chiana ? Do you understand what you have to do ? Yeah . Easy . You comm . - Yes . I join . - Yes . Leave . - Very good . Plenty of time . DRD Pike ! Keep an eye on her . I 'm awake . I 'm awake . What are you doing here ? Oh relax , Casper . I 'm not here to interrupt your blissing . Too much makes you go blind though , you know . What do you want , human ? I want you to take us to the shipping lanes . Then we can all get off this boat and you can continue what you 're doing uninterrupted . Okay ? What 's the matter ? Stay away . It 's your Pilot . I think this body is ... Monitor his internal circulation rate . Circulation rate . I ... I can 't find the circulation rate . What ? Oh , perfect . - What ? No circulation rate means he 's dying , numbnuts . You 're killing Pilot . I couldn 't be ! I gauged that this body could sustain me . You must have gauged wrong . Stay back . I 'm staying back . I 'm staying way back and watching you die . If I die , you 'll all die . I 'll vent every chamber on this ship . Whoa , there 's no reason to be vindictive . We can figure something else out . Moya . Moya 's a living ship . Yes . Well if she 's alive , then ... It will have neural capacity . More than enough to hold me till we can get back to my cluster . There you go . Yes . I will go into Moya . Now , Chiana ! Chiana ! Now ! - Chiana , it 's leaving Pilot . - Do it . Chiana ! If it gets into Moya , we 're screwed . What ? - Chiana ! Right , I 'm up . - Hey , Pip ! Okay . I 'm ah , okay . - Get on it ! Okay , here we go . Here we go . I 've done it . Great , Chi . Now get out of the Starburst chamber . Now , Moya ! Now ! Pilot , put the claws away . We can function without Moya being perfect for a while . I can 't stop . There are hundreds of little things not working right in her . I feel like I had a spiritual enema . Well , take a break , dude . Unless anybody wants to go look for the Three Stooges broadcast again . That 's a no . Take the rest . Hey , Doc . How come I bled and you guys didn 't ? Well , that 's obvious . You bled because you 're an irritating and inferior species . Goodnight . Chiana , you had that thing in you longer than any of the rest of us . You feel any different ? No . I just feel like fek . D 'Argo , you still in the Cluster ? No , he 's not down there . He 's here . No , he 's down in the Cluster . How did you know that ? What ? How did she know what ? No , don 't ... don 't tell me . I don 't really wanna know ... I just wanna ... I 'm gonna get some sleep . Hello , John . Now , you tell me everything you know about wormholes . Look . - Everything . I found it . I ... You found nothing , Scorpy . You missed it . You missed the whole thing . Game over .

 Hey , bro , I 'm driving drunk , and you 're lighting up a J ? Maybe we should wait for those ... hell , dude . Man , we 're in Vegas . Sweet potato Vegas ! Whoo ! Hide that ! Hide it ! Hide it ! Get it out of here ! Hey , hide that liquor ! Hide the liquor ! Hide it ! Throw that joint out ! Get him ! Get him ! Shoot him ! Shoot him ! Get out of the way ! Hello ? Hello ? Unknown caller . No call list . Probably disposable . Where 's Warrick ? We 've been calling him . There 's no answer . See what happens when you get in a high-speed chase with a garbage truck and end up with two dead bodies . Where 's the other one ? I take it he came out of the truck ? He flew out . At least that 's what every eyewitness tells us . Well , city landfill is a couple of miles down the road . What 's the TOD , David ? Nine , maybe ten , hours . I got no ID on either of the bodies . No ID on the truck . I ran the VIN number and the plates . They 're not in the system . Good luck . Control Sanitation is the only waste company in Vegas . If the garbageman works for them , his prints would be in the system . All right . Catherine , you and I got the bodies . Greg , since Warrick 's MIA , you have a choice : the truck or the trail . I 'll go for the fresh air . Do I get a choice , too ? Because , if you don 't mind , I 'm going to take the garbageman . Be my guest . I thought I told you not to call me on this line . Maybe that 's because I don 't want to talk to you . Are you kidding me ? Why don 't you ask the father of your unborn child ? No . That 's stupid . Don 't call the lawyers . Tina , don 't call ... Tina ! Tina ! Don 't call ... Tina ! Damn it . Hey , Gris , I 'm sorry I 'm late . I had some business to take care of . This is your business . You were first up . That means you 're supposed to be here first . You get to process the trash truck . No problem . But get it off the street . Tow it to the impound yard . CSI : Crime Scene Investigation - Las Vegas ( S08E09 ) Fixed By CajuCLC Enjoy ! These coveralls are brand-new . Your garbageman was in excellent shape . COD is as expected . Massive BFT due to his unfortunate collision with T-bird . And your other vic was in his late 20s . He was definitely crushed by something . Most likely , the garbage compactor . Which happened postmortem . Oh , it 's always better to be compacted dead rather than alive . Suffocation . He had petechial hemorrhaging . I found white fibers in the nose and mouth . Sent them over to Hodges . He called back , confirmed they were silk . I tried to trace garbageman 's cell phone . Like we expected , it 's disposable . So I tracked down the distributor . It was paid for in cash under a bogus name . But I did get an AFIS hit off his print . Brody Biggs . Former cop . When was this taken ? 1975 , police academy graduation . I contacted LVPD . They said he quit the force back in 1980 with a perfect record . Then what ? Social came back to several different garages around town . He was a freelance mechanic for 20 years . All right , we got to get his personnel file . What about the other vic ? It 's Jason Crewes . 27 . Got a hit off his work card . He 's worked at five different casinos over the last six years . Well , it doesn 't look like Jason planned on going anywhere . I know a lot of people in this phone . You do not . Knows some famous people . Or uses famous nicknames for his friends . Did you see anything ? Nick ! I think I just found ground zero . I think Jason was killed here . Well , this would have been the perfect murder if Jason 's body would have actually made it to the landfill . Would have been incinerated . At least now his mother has someone to bury . He was alone last night . We talked at about 3 : 00 in the morning . He said he got off work early and was going to bed , and he 'd call me when he woke up . But he never did . Have you ever seen this man ? His name is Brody Biggs . He 's a mechanic . Are you sure ? We think this is the man that killed your son . If he 's a mechanic , maybe he worked on some of Jason 's limos . I thought Jason was a club owner . He was a limo driver before that , long time ago . Well , couldn 't be that long ago . Jason was only 27 . You have to be 25 to be a limo driver . He had all kinds of fake IDs . Drove his first long one at 18 . The owner of the limo company liked Jason . Made him a VIP driver . Celebs liked Jason . He could take his clients to a Motel 6 and it 'd be the hottest spot in town . it Wasn 't long before the club owners invested in Jason , made him a group partner , gave him his own spot . Then two , then five . Suddenly , he 's running the whole club scene . I guess I should say he ran the club scene . He 's not going to be running anything anymore . I 'll be damned . Look at that . The good old days . Yeah . Here 's an ad for the Silver Slipper Casino- - buffet . Back when they had real eggs , not powdered ones . Hey , Gris , listen . About me being late ... You have a cell phone paid for by the department . You call , you say you 're running late . What 's going on with you ? I don 't know . This , uh ... This whole divorce has taken the wind out of my sails . You know , I used to have the team to distract me from all this , but even that 's changed with Sara being gone . I feel kind of disconnected . You 've got your work . Don 't screw that up . Van Halen , 1984 . Either this truck was delivering merchandise for a memorabilia store or it 's just plain old . Maybe that 's why Brass couldn 't find the registration record . These old blue license plates were issued in the ' 80s . I don 't think this truck 's been on the streets since . I think this guy was disguising his truck . It was orange before it was green . They used to use orange garbage trucks in the ' 80s . The hydraulic cylinder blew . Maybe when he crushed the body . Found this .22 in the parking lot near the crash . Check these bullets . Shorts . Usually used for shooting small animals , but in some cases they 're used on people in place of a silencer . Less gunpowder , less noise . Look , if the garbageman had this gun , why didn 't he just shoot the vic ? He found Jason sleeping . Why make a mess if you don 't have to ? Sounds le a professional hit man . Well , if he was , we still have to find the guy who hired him . We traced the garbagetruck back to The Regency , the company that made it . The only model of that truck sold in Nevada was to a company called The Regal Sanitation Group . They shut down in ' 83 . That explains the garbage . Regal Sanitation was owned by Anthony Pezzulo . I 'm studying mob history for my book . Pezzulo ? Wasn 't he the mob boss who owned the Starfly ? SANDERS : They called Pezzulo " Whacko , " not so much for his wacky personality as for his love for whacking guys . GRISSOM : Until he himself got whacked at the onsin Dells in 1983 . Every mob-owned business in Vegas shut down when Pezzulo died . These scumbags lay roaches . Just when you think they 're gone , they pop back up again . Somebody put a hit out on Jason . It couldn 't have been Pezzulo 'cause he 's been dead for 20 years . Pezzulo 's wife Kate got rid of Regal Sanitation right after he died . She still around ? She fell off the radar . All I could find was this old photo . WOMAN : I told you the truth . You lied about your name . The feds told me to forget I ever had the Pezzulo name . I wasn 't about to remember it for you . My husband had more cops than capos on his payroll . So you went into witness protection . You changed your identity . And then you stayed in Vegas ? Feds felt we 'd actually be safer here . They thought if we left , we might suffer the same consequences as Anthony . BRASS : Did Jason have any mob ties ? Jason was three years old when Anthony died . He never even knew his father . The last time we talked you said you didn 't know Jason 's killer . What about this guy ? That 's B.B. That 's the same guy . B.B. is short for Brody Biggs . B.B. didn 't kill Jason . There 's no way . He was Anthony 's friend . Friend ? B.B. was driving one of your husband 's old garbage trucks . Your dead son was in the back with the rest of the garbage . How did B.B. get the truck ? I haven 't seen.B. in 23 years . You got rid of the business . What happened to the trucks ? I gave that stuff to Lou Gedda . The owner of Pigalle Boulevard Strip Club . So don`t they get to know each other ? Of course , they were both on Anthony 's crew , but they would never ... Never what ? Never kill your son and dispose of him in one of the trucks you gave him ? When was the last time you saw Gedda ? I haven 't had any contact with him since Anthony died . So you 're telling me you haven 't seen or spoken to Lou Gedda in 23 years ? Gedda and I had an agreement . He was to keep away from our family . Forget Jason and I ever existed . Obviously , Lou Gedda is not a man of his word . This place has always been bad news . My guys are in here at least twice a week . Yet there 's always a line . Never underestimate the power of the ass . Looking for Lou Gedda . MAN : Yeah , come on in . Who let you two up here ? Just so I know who to fire . Gold card . Oh , yeah , those seem to work everywhere . Got to get me one . Ahh ... ! I know why you 're here . And I don 't know what to say . I can 't control these girls . They want to leave with customers and do whatever it is they do , I can 't prevent that . Believe me , I don 't like whores . I like dancers . When I find out they 're whores , I kick them curbside . We 're not here about your girls . We 're here about this guy . B.B. Yeah , works at my auto detailing . But I tell ya , he 's in here more , getting drunk and checking out the breast-est-es . Well , you don 't have to worry about him anymore . He 's dead . Oh . Well ... unless you invite me to the funeral , what 's this got to do with me ? Tell me about Jason Crewes . He brings me boatloads of celebrities , which equals boatloads of money . I love the kid . Oh , don 't tell me . You think Jason killed B.B. ? We think B.B. killed Jason . Now , see , that makes more sense . When is the last time you saw Jason Crewes , sir ? Last week . How long have u known him ? A couple years at most . I still don 't understand what this has to do with me . You missing a garbage truck ? Go again ? Regal Sanitation Group . Your buddy Pezzulo 's old company . Yoinrited the trucks . So what ? Jason Crewes ' corpse flew out of one of your trucks earlier this morning . Do you kno yhow much this club made last year ? 30 mill . You think I 'm still messing around with trash ? And that 's the end of this . You want to continue asking me questions , You gonna have to do it with my " dreamteam " present . BROWN : Here you go . Thank you . So you 're the talented Mr. Raykirk , agent to the stars . Uh-uh , manager . What 's the difference ? Uh , well , an agent gets ten percent and a manager gets 15 . Listen , I 'm here in town for a film festival and I have to get to a screening , so you can you just , you know , cut to the chase ? Jason Crewes is dead . Okay . Um ... So he took you to Pigalle Boulevard in August . Do you remember that ? How do you know about that ? I 'm an investigator . Some things I do know , but there 's a lot that I don 't . Somebody put a hit out on your friend . You want to help us out here ? I have an agent friend who I work with who had a bachelor party out here , and Jason hooked us up VIP-style . He took us to Moon and LAX and Drai 's and then of course , naturally , we ended up at a strip club . And everyone knows the best girls are at Pigalle Boulevard . It couldn 't get any better until the check showed up . Ten grand ? The manager said $ 800 a bottle . We ordered five . I hear you don 't want to pay what you owe us . No . No , no , no , no . I just think you overcharged us , man . No . This place is a rip-off . And your girls ? They 're beat , overrated , and oversized . Get it ? I 'm not paying . Let 's take a walk . I 'm gonna give you a minute so you can figure out what you want to do . I 'm cutting something . But I 'm gonna give you the choice of what it 's gonna be . No . Oh , yeah , yeah . I can slice you here or I can slice you here . ( sobbing ) Come on , no , no , no . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh , shh . Come on , you choose . I mean , I was never more scared in my life . You know , he was so sweet enough to give me the choice of my throat or my genitals , so I chose the latter ... so I 'd live . Then he charged my card and escorted us out to the parking lot . Oh , here 's something really cool . I left with a broken nose , some sore wrists , and some really nice bruises underneath my arms . And I just should 've given him the ten grand because I paid my plastic surgeon twice that . And you told Jason about all this ? Oh , yeah . I mean , he gave this guy Gedda a call right in front of me . Then he cursed him out and he told him he would never take anyone to Pigalle anymore . Listen , I 'm really sorry about all this . But , um , thanks a lot for your time . Oh , yeah . By the way , if you 're gonna prosecute this guy , I 'm not a witness . There 's a reason that I didn 't press charges , if you know what I mean . Four shots . Got an IBIS hit off that gun . Unsolved murder in ' 93 . Victim was found in the desert . His car was found at Pigalle Boulevard , the last place anyone saw him . GRISSOM : Our hit man 's good for two murders . The unsolved in ' 93 , where he actually used a gun , and Jason Crewes , who he suffocated . So , who hired him ? I have a good feeling he works for Gedda . Yeah , but we don 't work off feelings , do we ? According to Mr. Hollywood , Jason cost Gedda a lot of money , and he dissed him , which is more than enough for Gedda to order out a hit on someone , even if Jason is Pezzulo 's son . Any evidence ? I ran Pigalle 's address to find out if there are any more crimes linked to it over the years . I found hundreds : 416s , 413s , 411s ... The list goes on . y consistent suspects ? Only thing consistent is that the victims refused to file charges and the witnesses refused to give statements . S.I.d it 's funny enough the cops lost interest in pursuing it . What are you saying ? I 'm saying it looks like Gedda is running an old school extortion racket , and you can 't do that without having cops on the payroll . Hey ! I just want to talk ! I got warrants , man ! I 'm not a cop . I don 't care . You got a piece . Calm down . I 'm not going to hurt you . You live here ? Pretty much . What do you want ? You ever see anybody get beat up inside ? No , no , I never seen none of that . Don 't ke me pull those warrants , man . Yeah , I seen guys get beat up . This is Strip Club Strip . Guys get beat up and down this block . You ever see the owner beat up anyone ? Hey , they let me stay here . They 're real good to me . I didn 't ask you that . Lot of troublemakers , they come out of there and they get hauled off . That 's all I know . What do you mean by " hauled off " ? You got warrant ? Do I need one ? I own this plaque . Unless you 're lookin ' to get a detail job , you 're trespassing . What do you do with this ? I burn meat . Hey . Hey . What 's up ? Trying to get this warrant for Gedda 's property . I 'm getting close though . Check out these bruise patterns . Hey , what are those ? What ? Those pills ? Oh , they 're supposed to keep me alert . Really ? Yeah . How long you been taking those ? I don 't know , for a couple months . Aren 't you still taking those sleeping pills , too ? What 's it to you ? So now ... you 're taking uppers and downers . Gimme a break , man . No , you need to give yourself a break , Warrick . Hey , let it go , bro . No . No , I 'm not going to let it go . ( pills clattering ) What are you doing , man ? You need to take a look at yourself , Warrick . And I care because I 'm your friend . All right ? Yeah . All right , tell me about these bruises . BROWN : The 415 vic claims he got beat up inside the Pigalle . Couple days later , he dropped all the charges . And then there 's the unsolved murder . They find a vic out in the desert , but they find his car outside of Pigalle 's . Same bruise pattern . Now we got this Hollywood agent who mentions that he also has bruises under his arms . He claims that he was strapped to a barber 's chair in Gedda 's office . That should be enough for a warrant . BRASS : The judge doesn 't think the bruises are enough probable cause to issue a warrant . BROWN ( on phone ) : What judge ? Greene . When I was running bets for Judge Cohen , she was in on the action . I have no comment . You know , these club owners- - they pay a lot of taxes ; they fund campaigns ; they hand out free drinks , all in exchange for protection . I mean , what can I do ? Go to the Undersheriff , see if he can use his influence . But I doubt it . Excuse me . BROWN : McKeen ! Excuse me a moment . Judge denied me the warrant . What do you want me to do ? Get me the warrant . Lou Gedda is getting away with murder . All right , say that I get you the warrant . What are you looking for , something that made armpit bruises ? The barber 's chair in Gedda 's office made the armpit bruises . I 'm agreeing with the judge . McKEEN : Grissom ! You need to save your CSI here . What he has is circumstantial based off of weird bruises and a barber chair . Brown needs to get better evidence and leave the rest in our hands . I 'm sorry , leave what in your hands-Gedda 's money ? Listen to me . Putting Gedda in jail is not gonna solve your problems . You just got the rest of the night off . Hey ! ( gasps ) What 's in the bag ? All my stuff . I 'm just cleaning out my locker . Show me . Here , let me help you with that . Thanks . I 'm sorry . What can I get you tonight ? Got any Dom Perignon ? Mm-hmm . What about Cristal ? We do . We also have DP Rose . I 'll take one of each . Hey ... Hey ! I 'm sorry about earlier . I thought you were carrying a dead body in there or something . You 're a cop , right ? I 'm Warrick Brown . I 'm Candy . Nice to meet you , Candy . So , you work here ? Yeah . What do you want ? Everything . Hey , cheers , girl . Hey , let 's get out of here , you and me . I 'm working . Come on , I just want to ask you a few questions . I don 't go home with the customers . Pay the bill and let 's go . How 'd you know I was here ? You 've been here twice already today.y We 're leaving . Come on , Gris , why don ´ t you sit down and have a drink with us . I 'm on the clock . So am I. So you want to get fired . No , I want to let them know I 'm here . I figured I 'd order a couple bottles and not pay for it and see what happens . You think he 's that stupid ? It 's worth a try . Here you go , sir . Thank you . Well , now you gotta pay for it , 'cause we 're not allowed to accept gifts . BROWN : I left my car . I gotta get my car . You gotta admit , though , once I get this done ... Get in the car , Warrick . My car is right here . Go on . Go home . Sleep it off.FL I 'll see you in my office in the morning . Hey ... follow that girl . Thanks . Your welcome . You don 't give up . Not tonight . Irish whiskey . Neat . What 's your real name , Candy ? Joanna Krumsky Joanna . I 'll stick with Candy . So , now that we 're out of the Pigalle , you can help me out with a few questions . Good luck . Anybody ever get heavy-handed with you over there ? Not with me . I 'm a black belt . Nice . Not even the owner , Gedda ? Not even him . Thanks . So what about the customer ? They ever get beat-downs ? When the guys get drunk and start groping the girls . That 's not tolerated . You ever see a barber 's chair in Gedda 's office ? No , but I heard about one . It 's supposed to be Al Capone 's . Al Capone . Yeah , but that has to be a rumor . Mob guy with Al Capone 's chair- - it 's so cliché . Gedda 's like the last wise guy left in Vegas . Guess that 's his way of keeping his culture alive . Scumbags like him don 't have culture . Scumbags like him started Vegas . None of these lights would be here if it wasn 't for them . What 's a hot young thing like you doing working in a nasty place like that ? Money . The hours . The dancing . How about you giving me that last dance of the evening ? COME HERE , YOU . WHAT ... YOU KIDDING , RIGHT ? JOANNA : Relax . WHAT ´ S THAT ? It 's just for your protection . PUT THAT THING AWAY . It 's just for protection . OH YEAH RIGHT , PROTECTION . I DON 't NEED PROTECTION FROM YOU GIRL . U WANT IT ? COME HERE . DOES IT SMELL GOOD ? U BAD GIRL YOU LIKE TROUBLE ? NOW you TROUBLE , you KNOW THAT ? I LIKE TROUBLE . TROUBLE I like troubleare you scare DONT Thanks . No , no , no ! You can 't cross the tape ! Not this time . This is your car . No ! No ! No , this is wrong ! She didn 't do anything ! Fixed by CajuCLC

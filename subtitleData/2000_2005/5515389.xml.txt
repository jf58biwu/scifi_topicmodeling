Patient was unconscious at the scene with labored respiration and low BP . We 're bagging him and the IV 's wide open . Single entry only ? - Single entry . BEN : Hello , everybody . We are gonna need a stat chest x-ray here . We 're gonna cross-match for six units , then we 're gonna need a central line . Let 's move him first . Move him on my count , people . All right . One ... Two ... Three . BEN : Excellent . Very good . Go . Thanks , fellas . Placing electrodes . Get a second IV going . NURSE : Starting second IV . O2 sat monitor coming on . WOMAN : I 'm getting vitals . The monitor shows sinus tach . I 'm having trouble bagging him . All right , let 's find out why . BP 80 over 40 . We got no breath sounds coming on the right side of that chest . He 's probably got pneumo and his chest is full of blood . Let 's get the thoracotomy tray over here . Gloves ? His O2 sat is only 70 , Doctor . Swab . Let 's go . Come on , scalpel . ( SIGHS ) Tube . WOMAN : Doctor ? Doctor ! You okay , Dr. Cahill ? Doctor , BP is down to 60 . Still falling . Doctor ? Bill . Take over for me . You heard ? I heard the whole hospital has heard by now , Ben . I can 't overlook this any longer . ( SIGHS ) I haven 't had a drink in weeks if that 's what you wanna know . And I 've never had a drink on the job . Never . What the hell happened in there , Ben ? I don 't know . I 'm losing focus . I , uh ... Maybe I 'm losing my nerve . I ... I can 't explain it . Well , look , Ben , Whatever it is , we can 't have it in here . No , no . I agree . And I think I 'm getting better ... Ben . I think you need some time off . Meaning ? You leave me no other choice . I 'm recommending a leave of absence . Wait a second , you know I 'm a good surgeon . I am afraid this subject is not open for discussion . I have to do what is best for the patients . Now , I 'm not saying it 's necessarily a permanent situation . No , it 's a ... It 's a forced vacation . Oh , come on , Ben . Don 't fight me on this . You had a rough year . Now , I think you need some time off . When you think you 're ready to come back , give me a call , and we 'll talk about it , huh ? That 's the whole point of the quotas . We 've gotta replenish the stock . Yeah , well , while they 're busy replenishing , my kids are going hungry . I can 't pay the mortgage . My business is going right down the toilet ! Oh , you gotta come to the meetings , John , to understand what we 're talking about . ( PAGER BEEPING ) JOHN : I 've had a belly full of meetings . ( CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) JACK : What the hell did you do a damn fool thing like that for ? Maybe where you come from they treat the ocean like a slop pot , but up here , we treat it with respect . Sorry . I wasn 't thinking . Ah , it 's all right . Water 's a mess anyway . ( CHUCKLES ) Here . Have one on me . - Oh . Oh , no thanks . I don 't drink . So what business you got in Orr 's Island ? Oh , I have a house there . You don 't say ? Uh , bought it about a year ago with my wife . So , where 's the little woman ? Uh ... Actually , we 're divorced now . Oh . Where 's this house of yours ? Um , it 's on the east end of the island . About a mile off the access road . That the old Wald place ? That 's right . You know it ? ( SCOFFS ) I know every house on the island . No kidding . Really ? - Yeah . I work for the electric company . As a matter of fact , I am the electric company . ( LAUGHS ) When your power goes , I 'm the guy you 'll be dealing with . ( CHUCKLES ) Great . House needs a lot of work , don 't it ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Place is a mess . I mean , I 'm practically rebuilding it from the ground up . I gotta put a new roof , new electric , new plumbing ... Yeah , the people who lived there , I mean ... I don 't know . They must 've been crazy or something , 'cause the place is a pigsty , you know . I 've never seen anything like it . I have . By all rights , that house is supposed to be mine . Yeah . Me and my brother Eamon , supposed to come down to us . Excuse me ? My name is Jack Wald . Oh . - Yeah . It 's my parents ' house you bought . I grew up in that pigsty . By God . ( LAUGHS ) ( SHIP HORN BLOWING ) ( MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( YELLS ) ( LAUGHS ) Oh , jeez . Hi , big brother ! You horse 's ass . You 're jumpier than a frog on a hot griddle . Bummin ' my tools again ? What are you doing back so soon ? Thought you had a couple of weeks worth of work . Ah , didn 't work out . You shouldn 't of let go of that job . Hey . You want a beer ? Yeah , sure . Hey , guess who I ran into on the ferry boat ? Abraham Lincoln . Ah , come on , baked beans for brains . I don 't know , Jack . Just tell me . Dr. Benjamin Cahill . Who 's that ? The scummy bastard who bought the house out from under us . Oh , yeah . Thought I recognized his name . What 's he like ? Real city boy . A little weird . Yeah , well , that figures . Yeah , he says our house was a mess . Called it a pigsty . Well , you can 't argue with that . Like to mess him up a might . Give him a real Orr 's Island welcome . It was the bank that done this , Jack . Take it up with them . I 'm not too sure about that . Cahill 's probably in cahoots with them . Ah . - Those crooks . We could arrange that money if they 'd only given us half a chance . Pop hadn 't paid the taxes for five years . I don 't have that kind of money and neither do you ! You would 've wasted the tax money anyway . Let 's drop this , okay ? I don 't wanna talk about this anymore . Well , who knows ? Our house might go back on the market real soon . Oh , you . ( LAUGHS ) Ah , finally . Candles . Oh , come on . Come on ... Oh ! Spit ! Dang it . Oh , oh , oh . Come on , little fish . ( GROANS ) Well , you look like you really wanna be eaten , fella . I wish the fish were as easy to catch as you are . ( SAW WHIRRING ) Damn it . JACK : ( ON VOICE MAIL ) This is Orr 's Island Electric . You got a problem with your electricity , we can fix it . Just leave a message and I 'll get back to you . When I feel like it . Now , if it 'd be urgent , you know where to find me . ( BEEP ) Hello ! This is Ben Cahill . I 'm sorry to keep bothering you , but , uh ... Well , this is the third time this week that my electric 's gone out . So , I would much appreciate ... ( BEEP ) ( LINE DISCONNECTS ) ( DIAL TONE ) Ah , give me the usual . ( BLOWS ) What the hell is that ? Well , until you pay me for your usual , this is your new usual . Johnnie , your father served my father at the same bar . Your father paid my father , Jack . Put my brother 's drink on my tab , Johnnie . And if this weren 't the only bar in this island , I 'd walk out right now . Well , we all gotta make a living , Eamon . ( SIGHS ) Here . This is the last on credit for either of you . You got it ? MAN : First the government won 't protect the harbor from foreigners and then they turn around and tell us how big our trap should be . How the hell are we supposed to make a living around here ? Just this morning , I said , " Carol , you better dust off those glad rags , " I may have to put you out on the corner . " ( LAUGHS ) JOHNNIE : And how 'd she take that ? Told me she 'd already been . ( LAUGHS ) We haven 't had a decent catch in 15 years . You know why ? I 'm sure you 're gonna tell us . It 's the damn weather . It 's all screwed up with the global warming , the acid rain . No wonder the fishing 's down . Guy will back me up . What do you think , Guy ? - I don 't know . Well , we can 't fight the weather . But we can fight the damn regulations . Yeah . MAN ON RADIO : ... reported to be well above normal with market prices on the decline . Ground fishing for haddock is discontinued ... ( DOOR CLOSING ) Some tuna was spotted off ... ( SIGHS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Dr. Cahill . What brings you to town ? We need to talk . - What about ? Same thing we talked about yesterday and the day before . Power 's still giving you trouble , huh ? - That 's right . Why don 't you sit down and have a drink ? Tell me all about it . I already told you , I don 't drink . Yeah . Well , I think you picked the wrong place to dry out , Mister . Of course , I got my own little 12 step program . Step one ... Listen ... Can you take a break from the program , huh ? Come fix my power ? I 'd love to help you out , Doc , but the system here on the island is a little erratic . It ain 't like Boston . By erratic , that means it only works when you 're sober , huh ? What 'd you say ? I 'm sorry , all right ? We got off on the wrong foot . That was my fault , okay ? I just want my power fixed . Truce ? Please ? Why don 't you come back in June , with the rest of the tourist stock ? Promise , I 'll have your electricity fixed by then . ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( ALL LAUGHING ) Fifty dollars says he 's out of here by next week . Any takers ? - Knock it off , Jack . No harm , Sheriff . Just having a little fun . Shut up , Eamon . Jack , I know you 're upset about that house , but nothing can be done about it now . Says who ? Says me . Now don 't go causing any trouble . Excuse me ? Sir ? Excuse me ? Hello ? I heard you the first time around . Um , I ordered some lumber a week ago . I 'm checking to see if it 's arrived . Uh , the name 's Cahill . Uh , what hill ? Cahill . Kay Hill . Never heard of it . Right . Um ... Well , I ordered some lumber about a week ago . Could ... Is ... Lumber ? What lumber ? Hmm . Okay , um ... There was a woman that took my order . Yeah . That 'd be Nell . Nell . Is she here ? - No . Do you know where she is ? - Yeah . All right , Could you tell me ? It 's Monday . Yes , sir , and yesterday was Sunday , but that doesn 't help me find her . Mondays , she works at the warehouse down by the ferry dock . Right . Of course . Thank you . ( FERRY HORN BLOWING ) Hi . Uh , perhaps you can help me . I 'm looking for Nell . Um ... Thank you ! Hey ! Hey ! Excuse me ! Excuse me ? Sorry . Didn 't mean to scare you . It 's all right . You remember me ? Dr. Cahill , ordered some lumber ? Oh , yeah . You bought the old Wald place , right ? Yeah . Although the way most people treat me around here , you 'd think I stole it . Don 't worry . The guys will come around . There 's just a certain amount of resentment here for mainlanders . I know . I could feel that . Hope you don 't mind . I went ahead and ordered you some sealant . You 're gonna need it for that roof of yours . Thanks . Actually I was just gonna order some of this this weekend . Yeah , the rain gets pretty heavy around here , and when the snow comes ... Hop on . I 'll give you a lift to your car . Are you sure you know how to handle this thing ? Don 't worry . I used to play chicken with the harbormaster . Okay . ( ENGINE STARTS ) What happened ? He lost . Shoo . Go away . Oh , my ... ( WHISPERING ) Damn it . You got a bug problem ? Uh , yup . Uh , how about some fly paper ? No , thanks . - Sure ? Buy six get one free . No , I 'm all set . Thanks . Oh , okay . Are you gonna ring me up ? Wish I could help you , son , but ... I don 't know how to run this darn thing . Of course not . ( CLEARS THROAT ) So where 's Nell ? It 's Tuesday . It 's Tuesday . And Tuesday , Nell is ... With her mother . Where ? At the school house . I 'll be back . ( DOOR OPENS ) A report on the Greater Prairie-Chicken by Henry S. Crump . Today I 'm gonna tell you about the Greater Prairie-Chicken . The Greater Prairie-Chicken is the only wild chicken in the United States , but ... May I help you ? - Yeah , I ... Uh , sorry to interrupt you guys , but , uh ... I just need to see your daughter for a second , Mrs. Bartle . Well , could it wait , Dr. Cahill ? We 're in the middle of our vanishing species lecture series . Uh ... Why don 't you join us for a moment , Doc , and we 'll talk after Henry 's done . Okay . All right . Thanks . MRS. BARTLE : It 's all right , Henry . Go ahead . ( COOING ) HENRY : But is nearly extinct . Greater Prairie-Chickens are brown , with orange eyebrows and fly like ducks . The Greater Prairie-Chicken live in Illinois and not Maine , so I couldn 't bring one to class . Instead , I drew this picture , and my dad let me bring in Carly , who is not a Greater Prairie-Chicken . The Greater Prairie-Chicken is a grassland bird . It eats grasshoppers , ants , and leafhoppers , and it lives only two to three years . During mating , the male Prairie-Chickens do a dance called booming . They stomp their feet on the ground , flutter and jump , spread their tail feathers out like a fan and puff up the air satchel on their necks to attract female chickens . ( CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) Oh . That 's charming . ( ALL GASP ) You saw how big that damn thing was ? ( ALL MURMURING ) That was Clementine . The class pet . I feel horrible . I think you traumatized them for life . I think I 've been traumatized for life . Sorry . I 'm just not feeling that friendly toward bugs lately . Really . - Yeah . Last night I found a whole army of cockroaches in my refrigerator . I mean , big suckers . Gross . - Yeah . And I think Jack Wald put ' em there . What ? Jack put bugs in your refrigerator ? Yeah . How else could they get in there ? Well , bugs can find their way into any place , but I doubt it was Jack Wald . Oh , really ? Why ? Well , I just ... It just doesn 't seem like something Jack would do . Nell , he 's obviously trying to drive me out of my house . I don 't know . Jack 's not the psychological torture-type . He 's more the " get drunk and breathe in your face " type . Oh , yeah . I 've seen that as well . Okay . - Mmm-hmm . Be honest . How bad is this roach problem ? Well , I 'll put it to you this way . I won 't be eating chicken any time soon . Well , you can use the over the counter method , or ... If you promise not to poison yourself , I can fix you up with something stronger . I think I need the full artillery . Follow me . - Following . Okay . Let 's see . Hmm . Hey ... Who painted this ? That ? I did . - Really ? Yeah . Why ? - ' Cause they 're good . Thanks . No , really , Nell . You know , you could sell these . No . - Well , why the heck not ? I never really thought about it . Oh , yeah ? How much you want for this one ? You really want it ? - I certainly do . I think this would look excellent in my house . Well then , Doc , it 's yours . No . You can 't do that . That 's not selling . You gotta take some for it , Nell . Come on . Okay then . You can owe me one . The next time I sprain my ankle or something , you can fix me up for free . Deal ? - All right . Deal . There . It 's the answer to your infestation problem . If it were a snake it would have bit me . We used to have a problem with gypsy moths years back . We had to keep spraying this stuff . Pheno ... Let me , me , me . Phenoxyphenyl methyl dichloroethenyl . And in English . If it breathes , it will die . Yikes . - ( SCOFFS ) No kidding . JACK : Hey ! Vinyl tells us you 've got a little bug problem . Maybe you want us to come out and take a look ? I 'm good with bugs . Maybe you should just stay away from my house . Fix my power instead , huh ? Our house , ah ... That 's right , Eamon . It 's his house now . You have to forgive us , Doctor . Sometimes we forget . You know what ? You can harass me all you want , but I 'm not leaving town . You got that ? Harass you ? Yeah . What are you talking about ? Oh , you know damn well . I sure don 't . I 'm talking about the bugs , Wald . I 'm talking about a refrigerator full of cockroaches . You think I put bugs in your refrigerator ? Yeah , that 's right . I do . Oh , you chowder head . ( CHUCKLING ) I think you 're spending too much time out there alone in the woods . Really . What time was that ? Okay . Okay , yeah . Yeah , no , I know where you mean . Uh , all right . Listen , Guy . Just sit tight . Okay , I 'll be right down . Now , why don 't you come on in and let us buy you a drink . Just stay away from my house . Or what ? You 're gonna hit me with your stethoscope ? Stab him with your thermometer ? Take out his tonsils ? ( ALL CHUCKLING ) All right , Wald . Don 't make the mistake of picking a fight with me thinking I won 't fight back . Is that a threat ? Take it any way you want . - Oh , you hear him ? You hear what he said to me ? SHERIFF : All right , boys . Show 's over . You fix this man 's power yet , Jack ? Why , Sheriff , we were just fooling with him . All right , guys , clear out of here . Go on , go home , go have another drink , but off this street . Come on . Go . Jack , I want his power turned on today . For Pete 's sake . - Go on . Trying to be friendly . I 'm going to the block and tackle . Thanks , Sheriff . I owe you one . Good . Well , then you won 't mind lending me your expertise for a while . What , somebody 's sick ? Somebody 's dead . SHERIFF : Chandler Moffat . Kept to himself . Ran the lighthouse . Guy found him when he was pulling in his traps . What do you think , Doc ? It 's kind of hard to tell . When was the last time he was seen alive ? Yesterday . He had lunch at the Red Claw . Was he prone to any kind of seizures ? Epileptic or otherwise ? I don 't know . Could 've been , I guess . I don 't know . Hello . Stupid old fool . I guess I can handle this from now on , Doc . Take a look at this , will you ? These marks here . These caused by crabs ? Anything could 've caused that . Crabs , sea lice , anything . Planning on doing an autopsy ? Are you kidding ? It 'd take at least a week to get a medical examiner out here . GUY : Same thing happened to Tom Hale back in ' 88 . Got drunk , passed out and drowned in a foot of water . Then the crabs got him . Well , I think you should do an autopsy , just to be sure . I mean , if you don 't wanna wait for the medical examiner , then I can do a rudimentary examination . I appreciate your concern , Doc . This old guy had no wife , no kids , no one to answer to . And since they put that timer in the lighthouse , he didn 't have anything to do . No , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's just another islander got drunk and he drowned . That 's what my report 's gonna say . End of story . How much ? What are those for ? What do you think ? You haven 't gone fishing in 15 years . You gonna sell ' em to me or not ? Not if you 're thinking of doing something else to Cahill . What do you care ? This thing between you and him is all in your head . All in my head . Well , that 's rich . So , tell me , Nell . This thing between you and Dr. Cahill , whose head is that in ? I think you need to cool off a little , Jack . Just give me a six-pack of beer . ( SPRAYING ) ( TV TURNS ON ) Well , it 's about time . ( SQUEAKING ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( SCREECHING ) ( ENGINE STOPS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( HUMMING DRUNKENLY ) ( SINGING SEA SHANTY ) Huh ? Poor bastards . ( HUMMING ) Damn it ! Nothing wrong with that . ( SCREAMS ) Ah ! ( LEAVES RUSTLING ) ( YELLING ) ( EXCLAIMING ) ( RINGING ) JACK : ( ON VOICE MAIL ) This is Orr 's Island Electric . You got a problem with your electricity , we can fix it . Just leave a message and I 'll get back to you . When I feel like it . Now , if it 'd be urgent , you know where to find me . ( BEEP ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) SHERIFF : Let 's just calm down . It appears this was an accident . This was no accident , Sheriff . Yeah , you heard him this afternoon , accusing Jack . It doesn 't prove anything , Enoch . What about the beer in his car ? Yeah , we all know he 's a drunk Why don 't you smell his breath ? Now just shut up and back off . Why don 't you go wait in the truck ? Hold on , Eamon . Hold on . Look , I 'm awful sorry , but let 's just take it easy . I don 't want any more trouble tonight . There 's nothing to be done until we get an autopsy . When 's that gonna happen ? I 'll get the medical examiner on the next ferry . Next ferry is a week away . - I know that . And until then , we 're not gonna jump to any conclusions . All right . Now you guys , pick up Jack 's body , put him in the truck , take him into the Block ' n Tackle and ask Nell if we can use her cooler . ( BANGING ON DOOR ) ENOCH : Open up , Nell ! We need to use your cooler . ( BANGING CONTINUES ) There 's been an accident ! Hold on . I 'm coming ! Oh , my God . You got any room in cold storage ? What happened ? Who is it ? It 's Jack Wald . The good news is you weren 't drinking . The bad news is the entire town thinks you killed Jack on purpose . So , either way , you 're in a heap of trouble , son . Thanks , Mrs. Hobbs . You 're welcome , Dr. Cahill . Thank you , Mary . I 'd like to believe your story , Doc , but let 's face it , it sounds kinda bad . I 'm telling you , there was something wrong with the guy before I hit him . Saw the way his hand was clenched up ? I mean , doesn 't that seem familiar to you ? Coincidence ? No . I mean ... When a body dies , it goes limp . Rigor mortis , four hours to set in . So ? - So ... That means that after I hit him , his hand shouldn 't have been stiff . Unless ... Unless he was suffering from something else . Well , if you 're right , charges will get dropped . We just have to wait for the results of an autopsy . And until then ? You gonna lock me up ? No , I 'm gonna release you on your own recognizance . Thanks , Sheriff . But , listen . I want you to stay out of town for a few days , 'till we get the autopsy done . Well , you know you don 't have to wait . Why don 't you let me do the autopsy ? ( SCOFFS ) Forget it , Cahill . You know what the people in this town would do to both of us . All right . Something is not right about this . ( HISSING ) ( GASPING ) Oh , my God ! ( RATTLING ) ( STRIKING MATCH ) Don 't move ! If I don 't move , I 'm gonna burn my finger . Nell , you scared me . I scared you ? - Oh , sorry . Seems like every time I see you , you get more tense . What are you doing here ? Sheriff said you might need some food , so I brought you dinner . BEN : Oh ! But you aren 't afraid to be seen with me ? Was it an accident ? - " Was it an accident ? " Yes , of course . Then I 'm not afraid to be seen with you . Sheriff thinks you ought to stay out of town for the next couple of days . I think he 's right . My painting doesn 't look too bad in here . It 's a start . But I got a long way to go . Well , there 's not much else to do here on Orr 's Island . I know . It 's too bad I stopped drinking . Seems to be the number one pastime around here . Oh , God ! I 'm so sorry . I wasn 't thinking . That 's okay . It 's nice to see you enjoying yourself . ( NELL SIGHING ) I think I remember when you came to buy this house . You were with your wife , right ? - Mmm-hmm . I believe ... I believe that was a last-ditch effort to save our marriage , but that did not work . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . What about you ? You ever been married ? ( HISSING ) No ! Oh ! ( HISSING ) Okay . None of my business . I swear it was a cockroach . Sure ? I sprayed everywhere . Positive . Man , those things are all over the island . Hey ! Hey , you know that transformer station in the woods ? Wald went there to fix my power . I think he had some sort of allergic reaction . Allergic reaction ... to what ? - To the bugs . You see , I 've been trying to figure out why , when we found Jack 's body , his right hand was clenched , and these red marks all over the back of it . Now , I think those red marks were insect bites , and certain insect bites can cause paralysis . Hmm . But cockroaches don 't bite . I know , I know , it 's weird . But these were not ordinary cockroaches . These had pincers . Let me show you this . Here . Here , I marked it over here . " Frequently mistaken for the Madagascar cockroach , " Phylomenescus cerberus or the African armadillo bug " works as a highly organized unit , much like ants or bees . " They bite their prey and paralyze them " in order to lay their eggs inside the host . " Ew ! - Yeah , I know . Tasty , right ? " Although little else is known about these insects , " they are believed to pose no threat to man , " preferring instead to prey on small , warm-blooded animals " such as rodent , badgers ... " Blah , blah . What makes you so sure that that 's the thing that we saw ? Well , I 'm not . I 'm sure as hell gonna find out . You think he 's still down there ? Maybe we should run the water , just in case . Yeah , except that the pump runs on electricity , and God knows when I 'll get that back . Are you sure you didn 't just blow a fuse ? I 'm sure . I checked the fuses before I left . Did you flick ' em ? You didn 't flick ' em . Sometimes , when they blow , the switches get stuck . BEN : Really ? Okay , let 's see . ( RADIO PLAYING FAINTLY ) Hah ! Huh . Voila ! Come on , let 's go . Come on . ( WATER RUNNING ) Oh ! Here we go . Excellent . Hey ! Blueberry pie . My favorite ! You were holding out on me . ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah . Gosh , I kind of lost my appetite , though . Yeah , I know what you mean . - Me , too . It 's all right . You 'll eat it later . I have to get going . It 's been a hard day . Oh ? Yeah , sure has , huh ? It 's kind of sad , you know . Jack wasn 't such a bad guy , really , once you got to know him . No , I 'm sure he wasn 't . I just gotta find out what happened out there . Well , don 't think about it too much . Nell , listen , um ... Thanks . Thanks a lot for everything . Don 't mention it . You know ... You could stay . ( CHUCKLES ) Mmm . It 's a small island , Doctor . So ? You get some sleep . Good night . - Good night . ( SHIVERING ) ( RADIO PLAYING SOFTLY ) ( SIGHS ) Ah ! Ugh ! ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Entomology . Dr. Drayton speaking . Yeah , this is Dr. Ben Cahill . May I speak with Dr. Mark Templeton , please ? Dr. Templeton is on vacation , Dr. Cahill . Can I help you with something ? Perhaps . Are you familiar with the African armadillo bug ? Ah , yes . Phylomenescus cerberus , Interesting bug . What would you like to know about it ? ( SNIFFS ) Well , is it a threat to humans ? Not that I 'm aware of . Why ? Well , we got these things living out here in Maine . They look like cockroaches , but they have pincers . And from what I can tell , they 're biting people and causing some sort of localized paralysis . And you think it 's an armadillo bug ? That 's impossible . Well , Doctor , I understand it may be unlikely , but if you were here , I think you 'd think differently . Where are you exactly ? Orr 's Island , Casco Bay . ( SIGHING ) There are many insects which cause paralysis , Dr. Cahill . You said it had pincers ? - Mmm-hmm . Well , in the insect world , if it looks like a duck , and quacks like a duck , it 's not always a duck . So what you 're saying is you have no idea what we have here . Look , there are almost a million species of insect , Doctor . Some estimate there are somewhere between nine and 30 million more species yet to be discovered . Your bug could be anything . Send me a specimen , Dr. Cahill , and I may be able to help you out . I 'll try and do that . Thank you , Doctor . BEN : You crazy redneck ! You want a fight , fine , you got one . Let 's have this out once and for all . I got it from Jack 's answering machine . It 's from last night . Look , Eamon , I 'm sorry about your brother , but what 's your point ? What 's my point ? It was no accident last night . It was murder ! You 're way out of line . All that tape tells me is that Jack was a big pain in Cahill 's neck . Damn it , Sheriff , my brother 's lying dead , and Cahill 's running around free . It 's not right ! Well , what do you want me to do ? Do you want me to lock him up ? This is an island , where is he gonna go ? Nell sent you home for the day , Vinyl ? - Yeah . She and that Cahill fella . Do we really wanna do this here ? Unfortunately , it 's the only way we can find out what 's going on here . What the hell are you doing ? It 's my fault , Sheriff . I called Cahill down here ... I told you to leave the body alone ! What in the hell is wrong with you ? It 's not enough for you to run him down , now you 're gonna go poking around his body ? Damn it , Sheriff , you better lock him up now ! - Just let me explain ... Shut up ! - Look , just relax . I think I can explain ... ( THUDDING ) Eamon , that 's enough ! Lay off . That 's enough . Now get out of here , go on back to the bar . I 'll handle this . - You better , Sheriff , 'cause if you don 't ... - I said I 'll handle it ! Now get out ! All of you , go on . What are you , nuts ? I 've got enough on my hands without you screwing up . Sheriff , all I have to do is take a close look at the corpse . - What you have to do is what I tell you to do . Sheriff , take a look at this . I don 't wanna look at anything . I think you should . So look , even if these bugs bit him , how do we know that 's the cause of death ? Well , we don 't know for sure until we do an autopsy . These things could be like bees . One sting won 't kill you , but 100 will . Trick is , getting a specimen without getting bitten . Okay , you go first . So , where 's the bugs ? BEN : I don 't know . I mean , last night there were hundreds of them . SHERIFF : You suppose your bug could 've done this ? If they did , we 're all in a lot more trouble than I thought . SHERIFF : Why ? Because it looks like these animals were eaten from the inside-out . Oh . This just keeps getting better . Oh , Sheriff , take a look at this . Okay , Doctor , you got your autopsy . Huh . Ten to one that 's Eamon and his buddies , and they 're heading right for my house . All right , listen . Take Jack 's truck . He always leaves the key in it . Go over to Nell 's , I 'll deal with them , all right ? - Okay . Just find out what killed Jack . Cahill ! Cahill ! Looks like there 's nobody home , Eamon . ( SHATTERING ) GUY : Hey ! Eamon , you don 't have to do that ! Cahill ! SHERIFF : Hold it . Guy , what in the hell are you doing ? Are you crazy ? Is he dead ? EAMON : Of course he 's not dead . Well , what did you have to do that for ? Hey , he should have listened to us this morning . Should 've locked up Cahill instead of letting him run around free . Still ain 't no reason to assault a sheriff ! Settle down , Guy . Help me to lock him in the basement . He 'll wake up in a couple of hours with a little bump on his head , and we 'll come back and help him out . In the meantime , I am gonna get Cahill . ( GRUNTING ) ( BELL CHIMING ) NELL : Hey ! - Hey . What 's up ? - I 'll need a worktable , good light , and a sharp knife . ( DOUBTFULLY ) Okay . Hobbs gave me permission to autopsy the body . ( RATTLING DOORKNOB ) Hey ! Anybody out there ? Hey ! ( SIGHING ) ( PATTERING ) ( BANGING DOOR ) Hey , open the door ! ( EXCLAIMING ) Ah ! ( GRUNTING ) ( COCKROACHES HISSING ) ( HISSING LOUDLY ) ( EXHALING ) What is it ? Just expected to find some internal organs . ( GULPING ) NELL : Oh ! Oh , my ... I don 't think there 's any question now . Bite marks , the paralysis , and now this . What do you think ? I think we better get the hell off this island . God ! - Guy , what are you doing here ? Where 's the sheriff ? That 's what I came here to tell you , Doc . There was an accident at your house . He 's ... He 's in your basement . - He 's in my basement ? It was Eamon , I swear it ! He 's out of control , and he 's on his way here right now . It 's okay , Guy , we 'll take care of it . - It 's okay . I 'll go check on Hobbs . - EAMON : Cahill ! Cahill , you in here ? Oh , jeez ! Take my truck . It 's parked out back . The keys are in the ignition . - Thanks . NELL : Be careful . Didn 't you see the sign ? We 're closed . Where the hell is Cahill ? There 's something you need to know first . - Yeah ? Eamon ... Wait ! What the hell ? What 've you done to him ? Listen to me ... Did Cahill do this ? It is not what you think . - Just answer the damn question ! Now , did Cahill do this ? - Yes , but ... Ow ! - Just tell me where he is , Nell . That is none of your damn business ! No , you 're coming with me . Uh-oh . Sheriff ! Sheriff ? Hey , you okay ? I don 't know . What happened ? Did Eamon do something ? I don 't remember . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( RETCHING ) ( GROANING ) If Hobbs won 't take care of this , I will . Now , I 'd like y 'all with me , but I 'll do it alone if I have to . I 'm with you , Eamon . ( PHONE RINGING ) Hey , Eamon , grab the phone , will ya ? ( SIGHING ) Yeah ? It 's Eamon , Mrs. Hobbs . No , I haven 't seen him . Yup , I will . Okay , then . Bye . What did she want ? BEN : All right , what did you do with Nell ? You 've got no right asking anything ! Let go ! Hey ! All right . Now , listen . I found Hobbs right where you left him . He 's dead . You 're a damn liar ! Listen ... Hey ! ( GROANING ) ( GROANING ) NELL : Finally ! Are you gonna let me out of here ? Oh , my God ! What happened ? Are you responsible for this , Eamon ? What the hell did you do to him ? You can 't keep us in here , Eamon . It 's against the law . You lovebirds sit tight . We 'll find out soon enough what 's against the law . NELL : Damn it , Eamon . Those things inside your brother are real ! Why don 't you have a look for yourself ? Maybe I was wrong putting you in here . I should 've put you in a padded cell instead . NELL : Eamon ! ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello ? In jail ? What 's she doing in jail ? Okay , Mary , thanks . I 'll be right over . ( KEY TURNING IN LOCK ) MRS. BARTLE : Nell , what on earth is going on ? What are you doing in here , darling ? ( GROANING ) Could you tell me why you 're in this place . I 'll explain outside , Mom . Well , where is the sheriff and does he know about this ? ( GASPING ) ( GROANS ) No . Oh , my God ! And so there 's nothing to stop their natural cycle . Any predators these insects might have , they 've probably killed . And they 've got no place else to lay their eggs , except in all of us . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Hobbs . But we 've got to get everybody out of this town as quickly as possible . Well , why don 't we start with the children ? My class meets in half an hour . - Okay . Yes , then we have to hurry . Well , first we need a boat . Ours isn 't big enough to hold all the kids . What about the sheriff 's boat ? Do you have the keys , Mrs. Hobbs ? Let 's go . - Okay , let 's go . ( SNIFFING ) Smells good , Peggy . Henry still doing his chores ? Peggy ? ( MOANING ) You okay , Peg ? You ain 't said nothing all morning . I 'm not sure . ( CUTLERY CLANGING ) Peggy , what 's the matter ? ( EXHALING ) What 's wrong , honey ? It 's my stomach . ( GURGLING ) SARAH : Hurry up . Grab you coats on your way out to the playground . And wait for me at the flagpole , I 'll be right with you . In an orderly fashion , please , children . Sarah . Please make sure nobody wanders off , okay ? But don 't we need permission slips , Mrs. B. ? It 's not necessary , Sarah . It 's all been arranged . Thank you . - Okay . We got to move . Is that everybody ? Everyone but Henry Crump . He didn 't show up for school this morning . Did you call him ? - Yes , no answer . We gotta go get him . - Okay . Look , you go ahead to the boat with the kids . We 're not there in 15 minutes , you go without us . Now this is the address . The University of Southern Maine , in Portland . You gotta get this specimen to a Dr. Mark Drayton in the entomology department as soon as possible . Okay , Dr. Cahill . Honey , be careful . - We will , Mom . Is Sammy okay , Mrs. B. ? No , Thomas , Sammy should stay here . THOMAS : Ew ! Oh ! Al ! Al ? What 's the matter , Al ? Al , where 's your family ? Hello ? Hello ? ( SIZZLING ) ( COUGHING ) NELL : Ben ! Where 's Henry ? Barn . Ben , we need your help out here . ( GROANING ) We should go . ( MOANING ) Wait ! We can 't just leave him here ! Ahh ! ( GASPING ) Did he tell you where the boy is ? Barn . Okay , let 's go . ( FLESH TEARING ) BEN : Henry ! Henry ? Henry ... Oh , God ! Watch your step , the floorboards are rotten . Oh , thanks . Whoa ! ( HISSING ) Nell ! I 'm over here ! Oh , God ! Hold on , I got a rope in my truck . - Okay , hurry up ! I don 't think this is gonna hold me much longer . Uh-oh ! Nell ! ( CRIES OUT ) Ahh ! ( GRUNTS ) ( HISSING ) Oh ! NELL : Okay . HENRY : Over here ! Please , I 'm over here . Nell ! Nell , the boy 's down here . I gotta go get him . - Okay . Be careful . Tug on the rope when you 're set . BEN : Hold on . Are you okay ? - Yeah . Got nothing to worry about anymore , okay ? I 'm gonna get you out of here . I need you to listen to me very carefully , okay ? See how I 'm putting your arms over my shoulders ? You 've got to hold me good and tight . You got to keep your head low and hold on to me with your legs when we get out of this car . - The bugs ! Okay ? Don 't worry about the bugs . You ready ? Okay , one , two , three ! Wah ! Great work , buddy . That was good . Now we 're gonna go for another ride . Get on there . Come on . That 's a boy ! Okay , ready ? Nell ! ( LOUD HISSING ) Go ! Come on . You got him ? NELL : There you go , yeah . They 're starting to fly . - What ? Yup . - What 's the matter , honey ? My neck hurts . - Let me see . Looks like he 's been bitten . - Oh , God ! You drive . - Okay . BEN : Come on , buddy . Let 's go . Let 's go . Go . What do you mean , left the island ? They just up and left . The whole darn school . My son included . Maybe we should take a look at Jack 's body , Eamon . Oh , come on ! You don 't really believe all that nonsense about bugs , do ya ? Can 't see no harm in checking it out . I don 't believe you guys . You 're no better than that puffed-up quack we got locked in the jailhouse . JOHNNIE : I know Mrs. B. , Eamon . And if she 's taken my son off the island , it 's for a damn good reason . You guys do what you want . I wanna go over there and take a look at that body . JANE : Excuse me , Dr. Drayton . This just arrived for you from Orr 's Island . From Orr 's Island ? - From a Dr. Ben Cahill . Thank you , Jane . That 's impossible . Jane ? - Yes . Get me McArdle 's number at the CDC . ( HONKING ) Nell . Nell ! What 's going on , Nell ? Henry 's been bitten . Have you seen Vinyl ? - No . A lot of folks have been heading for the mainland . Rumor 's going around about your bugs . Yeah , well , rumors are true . As soon as I 've seen to this boy , we 're getting the hell out of here . - EAMON : Cahill ! I 'll handle it . You come back here , Cahill . I got a score to settle with you . Guy , you go with him . We don 't have time for this right now , Eamon . We got a sick boy inside . - Come on , Eamon . You and your friend in there are scaring people away . Your mother has ' em all in a panic with your cockamamie story . If you were smart , you would leave , too . ( DOOR OPENING ) What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Sorry , Eamon . Nell 's right . Are you out of your mind ? What the hell ? ( DISTANT BUZZING ) Holy mother ! MAN : What is it ? I think we better go back inside the bar . MAN : Good idea . Let 's go , come on ! Come on , hurry up ! Hurry up , inside ! Where are the damn keys , you moron ? JOHNNIE : I think I left them inside ! Come on , let 's go ! Let 's go ! ( SCREAMING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) Ahh ! Damn it , Drayton . Just do what I ask you , okay . Call the CDC , get ' em down here , kill these bugs , and get us off this island . Dr. Cahill , the CDC are aware of the situation . I 'm sure they 'll handle it . Ben , he 's getting worse . I gotta go . His larynx is swollen . He 's gonna stop breathing any minute . Nell , we need a small knife . Guy , get me something like a tube . I know , a ballpoint pen . - Got one . Great . Guys , I 'm gonna perform a tracheotomy here . Thank you . Hold that . We 're gonna need to sterilize this stuff . Hang in there , buddy . Good job , Henry . Hold that . Right on here . Okay , here we go . Could you get your hand underneath his ... - NELL : Like that ? BEN : Yes , perfect . - NELL : Okay . I 'll take that knife now . ( BUZZING ) Okay . Damn it . Hold that . Give me that knife . NELL : You 'll soon be okay . Hold on . ( INHALING SHARPLY ) Good . Give me that pen , please . Thank you . NELL : Yeah . All right . ( SPUTTERING ) ( GAGGING ) What was that ? It 's full of coffee from the jailhouse . ( MURMURING SOFTLY ) What 's that ? It looks like the bugs are gone . - What ? I guess they don 't like the rain . Well , we should get Henry to a hospital . Why don 't we just wait here until help arrives ? We can 't afford to wait . If he does into shock , he 's gonna need a shot of adrenaline . I have a boat at the dock . - All right , let 's go . ( HISSING ) ( HISSING ) The rain 's letting up . Where 's your boat ? At anchor . We have to row out . BEN : All right , take the boy . - I got him . Come on , buddy . BEN : Two lifejackets . One for you , and one for you . Guy , get in the boat . Get ready to grab him . Okay , let 's go . ( LOUD BUZZING ) Look ! NELL : Oh , my God ! Row faster ! - Oh ! I can 't ! Listen , we 're gonna try to flip the boat to use as protection . Lose this . Okay , we 'll go this way on three . All right , ready ? One , two , three ! ( LOUD BUZZING ) I think the water 's getting in his throat . ( HENRY COUGHING ) Great idea . You 're gonna signal for help . ( CRIES OUT ) What you do out there ? ( SHIP HORN BLOWING ) Hey . Hey ! Over here ! Over here ! Your mother and the other kids are okay , Ms. Bartle . Thank you so much . Dr. Drayton 's notified the authorities , the CDC are moving in to contain the area . VINYL : Well , it 's not like it was a commercial operation . Vinyl ? Nell , tell this guy here how long I 've been fishing these waters . We picked him up this morning for trapping lobsters without a permit . I guess today was fishing day . Well , sure , it 's Thursday . Thank God ! Good boy ! Good boy !

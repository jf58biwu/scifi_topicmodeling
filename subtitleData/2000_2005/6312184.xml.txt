 PREVIOUSLY ON JEREMIAH ... WHAT YOU DID , PULLING RIDGEWAY TOGETHER , THE ALLIANCE WANTS TO DO FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY . WE 'RE RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF DANIEL 'S GROUP . JUST GOT THE WORD , SIMS . THE ALLIANCE CONNED ANOTHER TOWN INTO JOINING UP . THERE 'S NO SAFETY OUTSIDE DANIEL . WE 'LL STAND AGAINST THE ALLIANCE AT A TIME OF OUR CHOOSING , NOT THEIRS . BURN IT DOWN . THEY CAME TO RIDGEWAY , THEY TORCHED THE TOWN , TOOK EVERYONE PRISONER . WHO DID ? SIMS . ( LIBBY ) : I WASN 'T EVEN BRIEFED ABOUT THE ATTACK ON JEREMIAH . ( SIMS ) : DANIEL APPRECIATES EVERYTHING WE 'VE DONE . AS LONG AS WE HAVE SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE , JEREMIAH IS MORE IMPORTANT TO US ALIVE . I SAW YOU WITH HIM ! WHO WILL BELIEVE YOU ? ( SMITH ) : HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO JEREMIAH ? SHE WAS KILLED IN THE BATTLE . I DID EVERYTHING I COULD TO GET TO HER . IT 'S NOT YOUR FAULT . I MEAN , THERE 'S NO WAY ANYBODY COULD HAVE KNOWN THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN . ( JEREMIAH ) : I KNOW WHERE HE IS , WHO HE WORKS FOR , AND WHEN I FIND HIM , I 'LL KILL HIM . I 'LL KILL EVERYBODYSTANDING WITH HIM . I 'LL KILL THEM ALL . HEY , JEREMIAH . WHY DON 'T YOU LET ME TAKE THE WHEEL FOR A WHILE ? YOU 'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR A LOT OF HOURS . I 'M FINE .

NO , I DON 'T . I DON 'T WANT ANYBODYTO LAY A FINGER ON HIM . WHEN HE IS FOUND , I WANT HIM BROUGHT TO ME . I WILL KILL HIM PERSONALLY . IT 'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE A STRANGE DISEASEWIPED OUT ALL OF THE ADULTS AND LEFT US KIDSTO FEND FOR OURSELVES . NOW I 'M MOVING AHEAD , THROUGH THE PAST . * I CAN 'T LET GO * I 'M HOLDING HOPE SO TIGHT * IT 'S HARD TO BREATHE WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD FALLS * * I 'M GONNA PUT THE STARS BACK BACK UP IN THE SKY * * LET THEM ALL JUST SHINE DOWN I 'M GONNA TRY * * I BELIEVE WE 'LL FIND THE WORLD TOGETHER * * THROUGH YOUR EYES * THAT 'S ALL I CAN SEE * I BELIEVE WE 'RE LOOKING AT FOREVER * * IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN BE FREE * * I BELIEVE * TAKE THAT , WILL YOU ? EXCUSE ME , WILL YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THIS ? I 'M LOOKING FOR THIS GUY . HIS NAME IS SIMS , OKAY ? I 'M WILLING TO PAY FOR INFORMATION . EXCUSE ME , CAN I PUT SOME OF THESE OUTHERE ? THANK YOU . MISTER , I 'M LOOKING FOR THAT GUY . IF YOU SEE HIM OR YOU KNOW ANYBODY THAT KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIM , YOU LET ME KNOW . HEY . EXCUSE ME , HAVE A LOOK AT THAT . HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GUY ? HIS NAME 'S SIMS . IS HE STILL AT IT ? ALL MORNING , ALL DAY LONG . I DON 'T THINK THE MAN HAS SLEPT . NOW , I 'VE SEEN JEREMIAH PISSED , I 'VE SEEN HIM HAPPY , I 'VE SEEN HIM OBSESSED , BUT WHAT I SAW IN HIS EYES WHEN LIBBY DIED ... I DON 'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN . YOU THINK HE 'LL GET OVER IT ? TOMORROW , THE NEXT DAY , WHEN HE GETS SOME SLEEP ? NO , I 'M NOT SAYING THAT . I KNOW WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO LOSE SOMEBODY . THEN YOU KNOW THERE 'S SOMETHING DANGEROUS INSIDE HIM RIGHT NOW ... SOMETHING NAILED DOWN AND IN PAIN . THE ONLY WAY HE 'S GOING TO GET OVER IT IS BY YANKING THE SPIKEOUT OF HIS HEART AND SHOVING IT INTO SOMEBODY ELSE 'S . LOOK , IF YOU 'RE NEW AROUND HERE , I NEED YOUTO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . I 'M TRYING TO FIND THIS GUY . HIS NAME IS SIMS . NOW , I KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM , BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHERE HE IS , OKAY . HERE , TAKE THAT . GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ! LOOK , I 'M LOOKING FOR THIS GUY . I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD . HERE . I 'M SORRY , JEREMIAH . YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP . WHEN 'S THE LAST TIME YOU ATE OR SLEPT ? IT DOESN 'T MATTER . YES , IT DOES . I NEED YOU TO BE CLEAR-HEADED . I WANT TO TALK TO YOU . THERE 'S NOTHINGYOU CAN SAY THAT I WANT TO HEARRIGHT NOW , MARKUS . MAYBE , MAYBE NOT . JUST GIVE ME AN HOUR . WE 'LL GET SOME FOOD IN YOU . I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE IN MIND . THEN , IF YOU DON 'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY , I 'LL TAKE HALF OF THOSE AND PASS THEM OUT MYSELF . OH YEAH ? THANK YOU . YOU KNOW , ALL OF US HERE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON . WE 'VE ALL LOST SOMEBODY DEAR TO US . I LOST MEAGHAN , AND , KURDY , YOU LOST ELIZABETH . SMITH , YOU , UH ... I LOST MY WAY . UH , THE POINT IS IS THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM- - I KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE GOING TO SAY , MARKUS . SAVE YOUR BREATH . JEREMIAH- - YOU 'RE GOING TO TELL METHAT LIBBY 'S DEAD AND I NEED TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE ON , AND IT 'S ALL FOR THE GREATER FINAL GOOD . THAT 'S NOT WHAT I WANT . YOU THINK I CAME ALL THIS WAY TO TELL YOU TO GET OVER IT ? I KNEW LIBBY TOO . I LIKED LIBBY . WE ALL DID . AND I 'M ... I 'M ANGRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED , BUT MORE THAN THAT , I 'M ... I 'M TIRED . I 'M TIRED OF LOSING WHAT WE LOVE BECAUSE WE 'RE FIGHTINGFOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN . I 'M NOT HERE TO TALK YOU OUT OF ANYTHING . I 'M HERE TO HELP YOU NAIL THAT BASTARD 'S HEAD TO THE WALL . HOW ? THE PEOPLE WHO ATTACKEDRIDGEWAY AND INNSMOUTH ARE THE SAME ONES THAT DID THIS . THE SAME ONES THAT KILLED LIBBY . THE DESCRIPTION MATCHES . I 'D SAY IT 'S ALL PART OF THE SAME CAMPAIGN . IT LOOKS FRESH . THIS CONVOY WAS ATTACKED LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO . FIVE DEAD , THREE MISSING . WHOEVER DID THIS DIDN 'T TAKE MUCH . IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BURNED MOST OF IT . THIS ISN 'T ABOUT STEALING . IT 'S ABOUT FEAR . IT 'S ABOUT CUTTING OFF OUR SUPPLY LINES AND CUTTING OFF SUPPORTFOR THE ALLIANCE . WE PROMISED THE TOWNS THAT JOINED UP WITH US WE 'D CREATE AND PROTECTFREE TRADE , BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE ATTACKS LIKE THIS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS . PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO ON THE ROAD . THEY THINK THAT WE CAN 'T PROTECT THEM IF THEY STAY HOME . WE HAVE TO PROVE OTHERWISE . WELL , HOW DO WE FIND THEM ? I MEAN , HIS ASS COULD BE ANYWHERE BY NOW . WE DON 'T . WE MAKE THEM COME TO US . ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS BAIT THE TRAP . A TROJAN HORSE ... GOT IT IN ONE . ( MARKUS ) : WE LET WORD LEAK OUT THAT WE 'RE BRINGING IN A LOAD OF SUPPLIES FROM THUNDER MOUNTAIN- - FOOD , TOOLS , CLOTHES , GUNS , YOU NAME IT , ENOUGH TO MAKE EVEN A DEAD MAN 'S MOUTH WATER , MAKE IT CLEARTHAT WHAT 'S IN THOSE TRUCKS IS IMPORTANT TO US . BOY , IS THAT A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES . THEY 'RE CARRYING SO MANY GOODIES IN THERE , I 'M SURPRISED THE TIRESDON 'T BLOW OUT . COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH ALL OF THAT STUFF ? NOTHING IN THE WORLD YOU COULDN 'T BUY . IS ALL THAT FOR MILHAVEN ? NO , IT 'S GOING NORTH IN TRADE . WHAT FOR ? DON 'T KNOW , BUT IT MUST BE ONE HELL OF A DEAL . THING IS , MARKUS WANTS TO KEEP THIS QUIET , SO LET 'S KEEP THIS BETWEEN YOU AND ME AND THE FENCEPOST , OKAY ? ( MARKUS ) : THERE 'S THREE PRIMARY MEANS OF MASS COMMUNICATION- - TELEPHONE , TELEVISION , AND TELL-SOMEBODY-A-SECRET . WE GIVE THE RUMORS TIME TO GROW OUT OF PROPORTION , AND PEOPLE , BEING PEOPLE , WILL START TO ELABORATEON THE STORY . PRETTY SOON , EVERYBODY IN TOWN WILL KNOW SOMEBODY WHO SAW GOLD AND MOUNTAINS OF FOOD ON THOSE TRUCKS . THEN WE STEAL THEM , AND WAIT FOR THE SHARKSTO TAKE THE BAIT . THEN WE KILL THEM . YOU 'RE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO ? JEREMIAH ... I JUST WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN . IF ANYBODY ASKS , YOU HAD TO GO BACKTO THUNDER MOUNTAIN FOR SOME BIG MEETING WITH MARKUS , AND NO , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT 'S ABOUT . ALL I KNOW IS THAT YOU LEFT ME IN CHARGE , AND NOT ONE HOUR AFTER YOU LEFT , SOME GUYS TOOK OFF WITH THOSE TRUCKS , AND MARKUS IS GOINGTO BE PISSED . THANKS . DO YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE ? NO . YES . I DON 'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO WORK , BUT I CAN 'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES . GOT TO KEEP LOOKING FOR SIMS ON OUR OWN . ANYBODY COMES INTO TOWN WHO 'S SEEN ANYTHING , ANYBODY WHO HAS EVEN HEARD ANYTHING , ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING , YOU TAKE ' EM ASIDE AND YOU SHOW ' EM THAT FLYER , FIND OUT WHAT THEY KNOW . I CAN DO THAT . TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF OUT THERE . I WILL . HEY , MARKUS , I HAD AN IDEA . SMITH ... WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? YOU 'RE NOT COMING . WHAT DO YOU MEAN I 'M NOT COMING ? YOU SAID- - I SAID WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO . I DIDN 'T SAY YOU COULD COME ALONG . THAT 'S NOT RIGHT . I SHOULD BE THERE . YOU 'RE IN NO CONDITION . YOU 'D JUST GET YOURSELF KILLED . MARKUS- - THE ANSWER IS NO . I 'M SORRY , SMITH . THAT 'S MY FINAL WORD . READY TO GO ? ALL SET . OKAY . HIT IT . WELL , WE 'RE IN IT NOW . YOU TOLD ERIN WHAT SHE HAS TO DO ? SHE KNOWS . SHE HAS TO MAKE IT LOOK CONVINCING . HAVE FAITH , WILL YOU ? COME ON ! STOP THOSE TRUCKS ! THEY 'RE GETTING AWAY WITH ALL OF OUR STUFF ! STOP THEM ! FINE . I 'LL DO IT . STOP ! STOP ! OH , SHOOT . JEEZ . TOLD YOU . THAT REAL ENOUGH FOR YOU , JEREMIAH ? YOU ... YOU 'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS . NO ? WHY NOT ? WE 'RE UNDER PROTECTION . WHAT PROTECTION ? I DON 'T HEAR ANYTHING . DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING ? THE ONLY THING I HEAR IS THE BEATING OF YOUR DESPERATE HEART . YOU 'RE ALL ALONE . THAT 'S THE MESSAGE I WANT YOU TO TAKE BACK TO YOUR FRIENDS . YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE PROTECTION , BUT THERE IS NO PROTECTION OUTSIDE DANIEL , NO SAFETY OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE CHOOSE TO ALLOW . ANYONE WHO SIGNS ON WITH THE ALLIANCE WILL VERY QUICKLY LEARN WHO HIS FRIENDS AND WHO IS ENEMIES REALLY ARE . SIMS , CHECK THIS OUT . WE FOUND IT WITH THE REST OF HIS STUFF . WHAT DO YOU THINK ? IS IT ME ? I THINK I 'M MUCH MORE HANDSOME THAN THAT , BUT HE DIDN 'T GET MY GOOD SIDE , DID HE , ROD ? WHICH SIDE IS THAT ? HMM . IS THIS FROM MILHAVEN ? I 'M NOT TELLING YOU SQUAT . IS THAT SO ? ALL I KNOW IS SOONER OR LATER , YOU 'RE A DEAD MAN . YOU KNOW , I PICKED YOU OUT OF THE REST BECAUSE I WANT YOUTO SEND A MESSAGE FOR ME ... BUT THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT , THE MORE I REALIZE THERE ARE MANY WAYSTO SEND SOMEBODY A MESSAGE . THE THING ABOUT SENDINGSOMEBODY A LETTER IS YOU ALWAYS GOT TO REMEMBER TO STAMP IT . HE 'LL GET THE MESSAGE NOW , THAT 'S FOR SURE . ALL RIGHT . COME ON . WE 'VE GOT WORK TO DO . YOU STILL UP ? YEAH . YOU SHOULD GET SOME REST . WE NEEDTO BE ALERT WHEN WE FIND THESE GUYS . I 'M FINE . HEY , I 'VE BEEN AROUND . I 'VE SEEN " FINE " , AND THAT AIN 'T IT , MY MAN . I KEEP SEEING LIBBY . IT 'S MY FAULT . I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT HER ALONE . YOU COULDN 'T HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING . IF I 'D BEEN THERE , MAYBE- - IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE , YOU PROBABLY BOTHWOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED . THERE 'S NOTHING ANYBODY COULD HAVE DONE , JEREMIAH . THAT 'S THE THING THAT I 'VE WORKED HARDEST TO GET OVER EVER SINCEELIZABETH DIED . YOU KNOW , IT 'S SO EASY FOR US TO THINK WE RUN THE UNIVERSE . " IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE , I WOULD 'VE DONE THIS , THAT , AND THE OTHER THING . " IT 'S NOT TRUE . SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? WE 'RE POWERLESS ? WHAT I 'M SAYING IS WE 'VE GOT TO LET GO OF THE SELFISHNESS BEHIND THAT THOUGHT . IT 'S NOT ABOUT IF WE 'RE POWERFUL OR NOT . IT 'S ABOUT US BEINGTHE KIND OF PEOPLE THE ONES WE LOVED WANTED US TO BE- - NOT OBSESSED , NOT LIVING IN THE PAST , NOT GOING OVER OUR MISTAKESFOREVER . THEY WANTED US TO BE LIVINGIN THE MOMENT , LIVING FOR THE FUTURE . AND HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO COME UP WITH THAT ? MONTHS . SOMETIMES , I 'M THERE MORE THAN OTHER TIMES . I 'M NOT THERE YET . ( CHUCKLES ) I KNOW . I 'M JUST GIVING YOU A LITTLE LOOK DOWN THE ROAD , JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT THE MOMENT YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT IS DOWN THAT ROAD . I DON 'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD ALONE . I MEAN , WITH LIBBY- - WHEN LIBBY ... SHE JUST ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL LIKE I HAD A CHANCE . YOU KNOW , LIKE I WAS ALIVE , AND THE WORLD WAS A BETTER PLACE THAN IT REALLY IS . IT IS , AND YOU 'RE NOT ALONE . LOOK AROUND , MAN . WHAT HAPPENED BROUGHT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN HERE . WE 'LL GET ' EM . HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE ? GOD TOLD ME . WELL , SMITH 'S NOT HERE.SOMEBODY HAD TO SAY IT . WE 'RE SLOWING DOWN . TROUBLE ? JUST STARTED . DAMN IT . WELL , THEY WERE DEFINITELY HERE . YEAH , A FEWHOURS AGO . THEY COULD BE A HUNDRED MILES AWAY BY NOW . OVER HERE . OH , THIS IS BAD . ALL RIGHT , LOOK AROUND FOR ANY SURVIVORS , AND THEN WE GET BACK ON THE ROAD . WHAT ABOUT ... WE CAN 'T LEAVE ANY TRACE THAT WE 'VE BEEN PATROLLING OUT HERE IN CASE THEY SWING BACK THROUGH THE AREA . WE 'LL COME BACK WHEN WE 'RE DONE . THERE 'S ALWAYS TIMETO BURY THE DEAD . SO I HEAR YOU TALK TO GOD . LOTS OF PEOPLE TALK TO GOD . GOD TALKS THROUGH ME . IT 'S A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE . OKAY , WHICH GOD ? THERE 'S ALL KINDS OF GODS OUT THERE , JEWISH , CHRISTIAN , MOSLEM , HINDU , GREEK , ROMAN ... I DON 'T REALLY THINK HE KEEPS TRACK . BUT YOU 'RE SAYING HE 'S A HE . IT 'S JUST EASIER THAT WAY . THE VOICE ISN 'T MALE OR FEMALE . THEN WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE ? LIKE THE VOICE IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD THAT WARNS YOU WHEN YOU 'RE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING STUPID , EXCEPT IT 'S BIGGER , A LOT BIGGER . YOU KNOW , I REALLY DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF YOU . I MEAN , THE WHOLE IDEA IS UNBELIEVABLE , BUT I REALLY THINK YOU BELIEVE THIS . IT 'S TRUE . THEN CAN I ASK GOD A QUESTION ? IT DOESN 'T WORK LIKE THAT . I 'LL MAKE YOU COOKIES ... IT DOESN 'T WORK LIKE THAT , EITHER . DON 'T YOU GET IT ? DON 'T ANY OF YOU GET IT ? I 'M NOT TRYING TO CON YOU , AND I 'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING AT THIS . NO ? NO , BECAUSE ANY TIME SOMEONE SAYS YOU HAVE TO PAY TO HEAR WHAT GOD SAYS , WHATEVER COMES AFTERWARDS ISN 'T GOD , THAT 'S FOR DAMNED SURE . I DIDN 'T ASK FOR THIS . I DON 'T WANT THIS . IT 'S JUST ... THERE . JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY ... DOES GOD HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME ? YES . WHAT ? PASS THE PEPPER . WHAT ? I DON 'T KNOW WHAT GOD HAS TO SAY TO YOU . HE HASN 'T SAID IT YET . COULD YOU PLEASEPASS THE PEPPER ? MY ARM IS HURT . THANK YOU . HOW 'S IT LOOK ? I DON 'T KNOW . I THINK I CAN GET IT RUNNING AGAIN , BUT- - HOW LONG ? IT DEPENDS.HOW LONG ? IF I HAVE TO GET IN , PULL THE WHOLE THING APART , I FIGURE MAYBE FOUR , FIVE HOURS . YOU 'VE GOT THREE . IF THE SUN COMES UP AND THIS THINGISN 'T WORKING ... I 'LL DO THEBEST I CAN . I DON 'T LIKE THIS . IF WE GET HIT AND WE CAN 'T MOVE TO DEFEND OURSELVES , WE ARE SITTING DUCKS . I KNOW , AND WHILE WE 'RE STUCK HERE , WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE THEY 'RE DOING RIGHT NOW ? HOW ARE YOU DOING ? I WAS JUST THINKING THIS IS A FIRST FOR YOU , BEING THIS HANDS-ON . IT 'S A BIG TURN . NO , I TOLD YOU IT 'S TIME WE CAME OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN , SHOWED OUR FACES , AND IN THINKING OF LIBBY , I , UH ... I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MEAGHAN WOULD 'VE WANTED ME TO DO . YOU HAVEN 'T TALKED ABOUT HER SINCE- - I KNOW . SIMS ... YOU 'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS . OUR SCOUT TEAMS JUST GOT BACK . THEY 'VE GOT SOME NEWS ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD . OH ? SEEMS A COUPLE OF NIGHTS AGO , SOMEBODY DROVE OFF WITH A BUNCH OF SUPPLY TRUCKS BELONGING TO THE ALLIANCE . WHAT KIND OF SUPPLIES ? YOU NAME IT- - FOOD , PARTS , WEAPONS . THEY SAY IT WAS PART OF SOME EXCHANGE BETWEEN THUNDER MOUNTAIN AND ONE OF THE BIG CITIES UP NORTH . IF IT 'S THAT VALUABLE , YOU CAN BET THAT THEY 'RE OUT LOOKINGFOR THOSE TRUCKS RIGHT NOW . WHICH IS WHY IT 'D BE SWEET IF WE FOUND ' EM FIRST , KIND OF ADD INSULT TO INJURY , YOU KNOW ? I DO INDEED . TELL THE OTHERS TO KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR THOSE TRUCKS . EVEN IF THE PEOPLE WHO STOLE THEM HAVE GONE TO GROUND , THEY 'LL HAVE TO SURFACESOONER OR LATER , GET RID OF THE MERCHANDISE . I 'D VERY MUCH LIKE US TO BE THERE IF THAT HAPPENS . DANIEL WILL BE MOST PLEASED . YOU GOT IT . HAVE YOU EVER MET DANIEL ? I MEAN , HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM IN PERSON ? NO ... BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE OLD WORLD , ROD , HOW MANY SOLDIERS EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO MEET THE PRESIDENT IN PERSON ? NOT THAT IT MATTERS . IF THERE WERE NO DANIEL , IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO INVENT HIM . SO IF YOU DON 'T MIND ME ASKING ... A GUY LIKE YOUCOULD WRITE HIS OWN TICKET . WHY 'D YOU DECIDE TO WORK FOR SOMEBODY YOU 'VE NEVER EVEN MET ? YOU WOULDN 'T BELIEVE ME . TRY ME . I GREW UP HARD , HARDER THAN MOST . FOUGHT MY WAY ACROSS HALF THIS COUNTRY , SCRATCHING AND CLAWING MY WAY THROUGH ANYBODY WHO STOOD BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I WANTED . I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CANNIBALS WERE THERE . I WAS ONE OF THE VERY FEW TO GET OUT ALIVE . I MARCHED THROUGH THE FIRES OF ATLANTA . I WAS THERE THE DAY THAT MEMPHIS WENT MAD AND EVERYBODY STARTED KILLING EVERYBODY ELSE , JUST BECAUSE . MY LIFE IS A RIVER OF BLOOD AND FIRE , ALWAYS ON THE RUN , SLEEPING WITH ONE EYE OPEN . DIDN 'T STOP A BUNCH OF RAIDERS THE NIGHT THAT THEY CAMEFOR ME , BEAT ME , ROBBED ME , THREW ME OUT IN THE FREEZING COLD TO DIE , NO FOOD , NO WATER . I CRAWLED ... FOR DAYS , TILL FINALLY , I JUST STOPPED , WAITED TO DIE . I CLOSED BOTH EYES ... I GUESS I FELL ASLEEP . WHEN I OPENED THEM , THERE WAS A COYOTE STANDING OVER ME , AND IT SPOKE TO ME . COME ON . WHAT THE HELL ... NOT IN WORDS , IN ITS EYES . IT LOOKED AT ME , AND ITS COYOTE EYES SAID , " GO THAT WAY , EAST . " THERE IS SOMEONE WAITING FOR YOU , SOMEONE YOU 'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ALL YOUR LIFE , " AND I SAID , " WILL HE GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO LIVE ? WILL HE GIVE ME A REASON TO LIVE ? " AND THE COYOTE EYESSAID , " YES , " AND I SAID , " WILL HE GIVE ME THE POWER TO KILL ALL THOSE WHO HAVE EVER WRONGED ME ? " AND THE COYOTE EYES SAID , " YOU 'LL BE FREE TO KILLWHOEVER YOU WISH , " AND THEN I HAD THE STRENGTH TO WALK WHERE THE VOICE TOLD ME TO WALK , AND IN THE END , I FOUND DANIEL , HIS CITY , HIS PEOPLE , HIS DREAM . THIS ISN 'T A FIGHT FOR THE PIECES OFTHE OLD WORLD , ROD . THIS IS A WAR OF POWERS AND PRINCIPALITIES . WE ARE THE COYOTE , ROD , WE ARE THE WOLF , AND IT IS TIME , LONG PAST TIME , THAT WE BARED OUR TEETH AND FED . TELL THE OTHERS WE MOVE OUT AT DAWN . POWERS AND PRINCIPALITIES ... HOW 'S IT GOING ? I 'VE ALMOST GOT IT . HE 'S ALMOST GOT IT . SO I HEAR . WE 'RE TOO EXPOSED OUT HERE . WE HAVE TO GET EVERYBODY BACK IN THE TRUCKS . IF THESE PEOPLE HAVE SCOUTS OUT , I DON 'T WANT THEM TO SEE WHAT WE 'RE PACKING HERE . ( ENGINE TURNS OVER ) ( ENGINE QUITS ) AW , COME ON . ( ENGINE TURNS OVER ) COME ON . ( ENGINE REVS ) ( SCREAMS ) OH , DAMN IT ! I 'M SORRY , MARKUS . NO , NO . YOU DID GOOD . YOU DID GOOD . GET THAT GUY MEDICAL ATTENTION ! GET HIM TO THE BACK ! WE 'RE SHORT A DRIVER . NO , WE 'RE NOT . HERE . THE GUY IN FRONT 'S THE MOST VULNERABLE . IF THERE 'S A PROBLEM- - IF THERE 'S A PROBLEM , I CAN HANDLE IT . ALL RIGHT , FIRE ' EM UP , PEOPLE ! WE 'RE HITTING THE ROAD ! SIMS , WE 'VE GOT A MESSAGE COMING IN FROM BASE . THIS ISN 'T THE TIME . I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TAKE IT . SIMS HERE . PROBLEM ? WE 'RE RUNNING LOW ON FUEL . IF WE DON 'T FIND THESE GUYS SOON , WE 'LL HAVE TO HEAD BACK , TRY AGAIN LATER . HOW MUCH LATER ? TO GET ENOUGH DIESEL FUEL DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN , MAYBE A DAY OR TWO- - TWO- - NO , NO , NO WAY , NOT TWO DAYS , MARKUS . THIS WON 'T WORK . THESE GUYS WILL NEVER FALL FOR THIS A SECOND TIME . NOBODY 'LL BELIEVE THESE TRUCKS ARE DRIVING AROUND FOR TWO DAYS . WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ? THE MATH IS THE MATH . " X " AMOUNT OF FUEL EQUALS " Y " AMOUNT OF TIME ON THE ROAD- - OKAY , SO WE SPLIT UP , DIVIDE THE FUEL . HEADS UP , PEOPLE . NOBODY AROUND ... THEY COULD BE IN THE TREES . YOU COULD HIDE AN ARMY IN THERE . WHAT 'S OUR ESCAPE ROUTE LOOK LIKE ? WE COULD TURN AROUND , BUT IT WOULD TAKE FOREVER . STOP THE TRUCKS HERE . WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR ? FOR US TO MAKE A MISTAKE , TO EXPOSE OURSELVES . LOOK , I CAN- - NO , WE HOLD OUR POSITION RIGHT HERE . LET THEM COME TO US . THEY COULD BE CIRCLING BEHIND RIGHT NOW . I NEED TO DRAW THEM IN CLOSER , MARKUS , WHERE WE CAN- - NEGATIVE . I WON 'T EXPOSE ANYONE TO UNNECESSARY DANGER UNLESS I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE . FORGET THIS . KURDY ... WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ... KURDY ! ( GUNS COCKING ) WHOA , WHOA , WHAT IS THIS ? SHUT THE HECK UP . ALL RIGHT , FELLOWS , I DON 'T WANT ANY TROUBLE HERE . GIVE US THE KEYS TO THE TRUCK AND THERE WON 'T BE ANY TROUBLE . DAMN IT . WHAT ? KURDY 'S IN THE LINE OF FIRE . WHAT THE HELL 'S HE DOING ? HE 'S TRYING TO LURE THEM CLOSER TO THE TRUCKS , GET THE OTHERSTO SHOW THEIR FACES SO WE CAN KNOW WHERE THEY ARE . DAMN ... JEREMIAH- - GIVE US THE KEYS TO THE TRUCK . OKAY . ALL RIGHT . OKAY , THAT 'S ENOUGH . WHAT THE HELLARE YOU DOING ? I DON 'T KNOW WHY I SEND YOUTO TALK TO PEOPLE . YOU DON 'T HAVE THE BESTPEOPLE SKILLS . YOU 'VE GOT TO TALK WITH THESE GUYS , AND ONCE THEY KNOW THE DEAL , EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY . OKAY , LISTEN , HERE 'S THE DEAL . YOU LET US GO OR AT LEAST ONE OF YOU IS GOING DOWN . I DON 'T CARE WHICH ONE . YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE ? YOU 'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND , YOU KNOW THAT ? WE GOT TWO ON TWO HERE , PLUS WE GOT A GUY IN THE TRUCK . THAT GIVES US THE ADVANTAGE . YOU JUST SIGNED YOUR OWN DEATH WARRANT , BUDDY . HE 'S NOT HERE . WHO ? SIMS , THE GUY IN CHARGE . ARE YOU SURE ? YOU CHECKED EVERYBODY ? TWICE . HE 'S NOT HERE , I SAID . ( LAUGHING ) YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ? YEAH . YOU LOSE . SIMS GOT CALLED BACK HOME FOR AN IMPORTANT MEETING . OH , HE REALLY WANTED TO BE HERE , BUT I 'M SURE HE 'D SEND HIS REGARDS . WHEN DID HE LEAVE ? SCREW YOU . HE WASN 'T THERE , BUT YOU WERE , RIGHT ? THAT NIGHT AT INNSMOUTHWHEN THEY ATTACKED . JEREMIAH ... THE NIGHT SHE DIED . I 'VE BEEN THERE WHEN ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED , CHIEF . WHAT 'S ONE MORE ? DON 'T DO IT . YOU SAID BRING ' EM IN AND KILL ' EM . DURING THE FIGHT , BUT THE FIGHT 'S OVER . WE WORSE THAN KILLED THEM . WE BEAT THEM . WE CRIPPLED THEIR OPERATION . THESE PEOPLE ARE PRISONERS . THEY 'LL FACE JUSTICE AT THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE THEY 'VE HARMED . YEAH , AND I 'M ONE OF THOSE , MARKUS . YOU 'RE NOTTHE GUY I WANT . YOU 'RE JUST SOME PUNK THAT TAKES ORDERS . I WANT THE GUY WHO GAVE THE ORDER . YOU KNOW WHY YOU 'RE GOING TO LOSE ? YOU 'RE TOO WEAKTO GET THINGS DONE ! US , WE 'RE WILLING TO DOWHAT 'S NECESSARY . YOU 'RE SOFT , AND YOU 'RE WEAK , AND YOU KNOW WHAT ? THAT BITCH PROBABLY DESERVED TO DIE . ( GUNSHOT ) OKAY , LOAD ' EM UP ! WE 'RE GOING HOME . YOU OKAY ? YEAH , I WAS JUST ... I 'M OKAY . THEY 'RE LOOKINGFOR YOU . I KNOW . I KNOW WHATYOU 'RE FEELING . I MISS HER , TOO . DID YOU EVER HAVE TO KILL ANYONE , ERIN ? I DON 'T MEAN FIRING INTO A BIG GROUP WHEN IT 'S ALL A BLUR . I MEAN REALLY LOOKING INTO SOMEBODY 'S EYES , AND ... IT 'S A DANGEROUS WORLD . THE ONLY WAY ANYONE COULD SURVIVE AFTER THE BIG DEATH IS DOING WHAT WAS NECESSARY . WAS THAT A YES ? TWICE . DID YOU EVER STOP SEEING THEIR EYES WHEN YOU TRY TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT ? YEAH . IT TAKES A LONG TIME . IT TAKES A REALLONG TIME . ANYWAY , WE SHOULD GET GOING . REMEMBER WHEN YOU ASKED IF GOD HAD ANYTHING TO SAY TO YOU ? I LIED . HE DID . IT 'S JUST , YOU KNOW , THERE 'S A TIME AND PLACE . AND I USUALLY LIKE TO WAIT UNTIL THE COAST IS CLEAR , YOU KNOW ? GOD SAYS ... I SAW YOUR FACE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN , I KNEW YOUR NAME BEFORE IT WAS SPOKEN , AND I HEARD YOUR VOICE BEFORE YOU CRIED AT BIRTH , AND I BRING ONLY BEAUTIFUL THINGS INTO THIS WORLD , AND YOU WILL , TOO , IN YOUR TIME ... AND ONE DAY , NOT FAR AWAY , YOU 'LL HAVE TO LEAVE MARKUS AND THE SAFETY AND SECURITYOF THE MOUNTAIN , AND YOU 'LL KNOW THAT YOU 'RE WALKINGINTO THE DARKNESS , AND YOU 'LL GO . YOUR HEART WILL LIGHT A PATH YOUR MIND WILL NOT WANT TO TRAVEL , BUT YOU 'LL DO IT ANYWAY , KNOWING THAT YOU 'LL NEVER SEE THE MOUNTAIN AGAIN , YOU 'LL NEVER RETURN , AND THE NEXT TIME I HEAR YOUR VOICE AND SEE YOUR FACE , THE NEXT TIME I ... I CALL YOUR NAME , YOU 'LL KNOW THAT YOUR SACRIFICE WAS NOT IN VAIN . ( MARKUS ) : I SENT MESSAGES TO RIDGEWAY AND INNSMOUTH . THEY 'LL BE COMING FOR THE PRISONERS . BEFORE THAT , I WANT TO QUESTION THESE PEOPLE , FIND OUT WHAT I CAN ABOUT THEIR OPERATION . AT LEAST WE 'VE GOT A REPRIEVE . IT 'LL TAKE A WHILE BEFORE THEY CAN PUT THIS BACK TOGETHER AGAIN . I WANT SOME IDEA ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE . WITH LUCK , WE CAN STOP THE NEXT PROBLEM BEFORE IT HAPPENS . I 'LL GET STARTED . CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER . HOW ARE YOU DOING ? WHAT , DO YOU MEAN DO I FEEL ANY BETTER ? NO , AND I WON 'T , AS LONG AS THE GUY WHO DID THIS IS STILL OUT THERE ALIVE SOMEWHERE . MAN , ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SIMS OR DANIEL ? DANIEL 'S JUST A NAME SO FAR , KURDY . SIMS WAS THERE . WE DEAL WITH THAT , AND THEN WE 'LL SEE . YOU SOUND LIKE A MAN READY TO GO TO WAR . AND YOU 'RE NOT ? I DON 'T KNOW , BUT THE MORE I SEE OF THESE GUYS , THE MORE IT SEEMS LIKE WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE . I 'M GOING TO FIND SMITHAND HIT THE ROAD . HEY , UH , KURDY ... THANKS FOR GETTING MY BACK ... ONCE AGAIN . SAME HERE . 'CAUSE , YOU KNOW , WE DO MAKE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM . WE COULD TRY IT ... MORE OFTEN . MAYBE SO , JEREMIAH . MAYBE SO .

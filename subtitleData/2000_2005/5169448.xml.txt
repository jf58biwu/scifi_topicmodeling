 Okay , I got it . Here we go . [ Dick ] Sally ! Harry ! Sally ! I have terrible news ! Dick , get in the picture . I didn 't know our camera had a self-timer . What 's a self-timer ? Oh , for God 's sake , never mind ! I have some terrible news ! Liam was gonna go through with his plan to turn Earth into Planet Monkey World , so I had to use his own weapon to turn him into a chimp ! Oh , my God . You chimpified Liam ? Yes ! But that 's not the worst part . Mary saw me do it ! She witnessed something alien ! There is no good way to explain what she saw . Okay , okay . Okay , damage control , you guys . We have to normalize the situation . But how ? What if we ... chimpify everyone in ... say , the Ukraine ? We tell Albright that Liam is Ukrainian . Yeah . And it finally caught up with him . Yeah ! It 's settled ! Tonight , we fly to Kiev . Wait , wait . That 's , like , a 12-hour flight . Yeah , and you have to connect through Warsaw . It 's a bitch . Mmm , yeah . Once you get there , you lost the whole day . Ooh ! I have a better idea ! Why don 't you just deny it and then act like it never happened ? That 's right . Deny . Good idea . And we have a kick-ass Ukrainian Plan B. â™ª [ rock ' n ' roll ] Nina , please , I need to talk to you in person . I think there might be something wrong with Dick . I--I think I might be in danger . No , I have not been watching old movies . Yes , I have been drinking . [ knocking ] Oh , my God ! There 's somebody at the door ! Please stay on the line . Dick ! Hi ! How are ya ? Good to see ya ! Hello . How ya doin ' ? Everything okay ? Yeah , yeah . Mind if I come in ? No , no . Why--why- - Why would I ? Well , I guess you shouldn 't . You are my girlfriend , aren 't you ? Sure am . Have been for a long , long time . I 've been good to you . Mary , were you talki " on the telephone ? No , no , no . There 's no dial tone . H-Hello ? Nina ! No , e-everything 's fine here . Yeah , like it always is here . Tell her , Mary . Just like he says , everything 's fine . Don 't worry , I 'll take care of her . So , I , uh ... I guess you were talking on the phone , huh ? [ stuttering ] T-To Nina . Yeah . [ laughing ] Yeah . I guess I forgot . [ laughing ] You forgot , huh ? [ laughing ] Oh , well , this sure has been a normal day for us , huh ? [ laughing ] I 'll see ya ! Yeah , bye ! I 'll drive safely ! Yes , please ! [ laughing ] Oh ! Oh , my God ! Look at this place ! Yeah , there must have been a robbery here . Oh , no . I 'm gonna go with murder . No way . Robbery . Murder . Robbery . Murder ! Robbery ! You know what ? Let 's not argue about it . Hopefully , we 're both right , okay ? Hey , Rico , what 's goin ' on here ? There 's been a robbery . Aw , damn ! Yeah ! Yeah , but don 't worry . We got the guy . Cool . Is Don here ? No , he , uh , took a sick day to catch up on his soaps . Oh . I 'll take over from here , Rico . Name ? Sam . Sam . Was your boyfriend one of the robbers , Sam ? I don 't have a boyfriend . Doesn 't have a boyfriend . Pot Pies , Belly Stuffers , Breakfast in Seconds ... Ah , here we are . Pizza . Don ? What are you doing in there ? [ stuttering ] I 'm i-inspecting . Yeah . Uh , yep , these frozens are up to code . Good work , people ! Now , one last thing . Tomorrow night , you wanna go out on a date ? How ' bout 9 ? Slow down there . Let 's try one . See how it goes . So , if you knew you were gonna be on freezer duty , why didn 't you dress for it ? Cold doesn 't bother me . Then why are you shaking ? Why am I shaking ? [ sobbing ] I 'm shaking because there was a robbery . There 's no such thing as freezer duty . What ? I--I was hidin from the bad guy . I 'm a coward . No . That 's why I joined the force . All those cops around , I thought I 'd feel safe . Thanks for coming out with me . Purge your soul , and let 's flag down a waitress . I think there might be something wrong with Dick . I think I might be in danger . I think she 's ready for the talk . We 've always been suspicious of Dr. Solomon . Secretive about his past , speaks many languages , pretends not to understand anything . What are you saying ? He has another identity ? Yes . I think " stupid college professor " is just a front . I think he 's a stupid international terrorist . Face facts , Mary . Dick Solomon fits the classic profile of a serial killer . A serial killer ? Moody , high forehead . Lives in an old lady 's attic . Only one piece of the puzzle missing : your head in a box . Hey , cutie . Hey , Sam . No , no , no , no , no . Sam works at the supermarket , but this place tries to be a little fancy , so ... " Samantha " works here . Well , wait a second . So there 's you , and then there 's Sam . Exactly . Oh . Well , it 's a good thing you 're both working ' . So 9 : 00 is good ? For what ? We 're goin ' out . Wow , Samantha , you a take-charge kind of girl , huh ? Well , okay , but- - Oh , 9 's no good . I got plans . How ' bout 7 ? Um ... okay . Okay . I 'll be there at 7 . Okay . Hi . Table for two ? Right this way . Hot damn , I 'm dating ' twins . Hello , Mary . What are you doing at my desk ? I 'm looking for some information about you . About me ? What 's to know ? Dick , why don 't you ever talk about your childhood ? How come I 've never met your parents ? Well , I told them all about you , Mary , and they didn 't want to meet you . Well , what are their names ? Where--Where are their pictures , some mementos ? Uh , well ... okay , Mary . Uh , this is my father 's lucky one-dollar bill . And , um ... and this pencil was given to my mother by Babe Ruth . See his number ? Number two . [ breaks pencil ] Hey ! I was gonna pass that on to my son , when I had one ! You have a son ! Tommy . Oh ! Right . Dick , I think you 've been hiding something from me , and I think you 've been hiding it from me for 6 years . Oh , what makes you say that ? I saw you turn a man into a monkey ! Actually , it was a chimpanzee . And it never happened . That 's it ! No more covers ! No more lies ! I don 't know who you are ! I don 't know what you are ! All I know is that I- - I can 't see you anymore . Good-bye , Dick . Mary , wait ! Okay . Look , I 've been wanting to tell you this for a long time . This is hard . I want to make sure I say it right . It 's okay . Mary , I 'm- - What rhymes with " shmalien " ? Oh , forget it ! Mary ! I ... Dick Solomon ... am an alien . From outer space . [ groans , coughs ] Where am I ? And what 's going on ? You lied so much , you passed out . Mary ... it 's true . I 'm the High Commander of an exploratory mission that came to Earth 6 years ago to study mankind . Does your family know about this ? We 're not a family . We 're a unit . Tommy is the information officer . Sally is the security officer . And Harry has an enormous transmitter in his head . Oh , that 's impossible ! Except for the Harry part . Open your mind . Think about everything you don 't know about me . And then think about everything you do know . Think about how ... every single time something happens , it 's like I 'm learning it for the first time ... like a child . Mary , think about our entire 6-year relationship ... knowing that I 'm an alien . You are an alien . Yes . Why didn 't I see this before ? Because you 're only human . [ door opens ] [ panting ] Don ? What 's with the police tape surrounding your house ? I 'm not in the mood for company . I 'm a coward . All right . Now , you listen to me , Donald Leslie Orville . Ever since I have know you , you have gone out there every day and done your job , even though you 're scared to death . There 's only one word for that kind of coward . Brave ! I never thought of that . Well , think again . And you know what ? Now that you 've been honest with yourself ... you have the power to be the man you 've always wanted to be ... the man you deserve to be . The man ... I fell in love with . I feel like I can go back out in the world and start again . I can always tape my soaps ! Thank you , Sally . My pleasure . Now ... that 's my boy . [ screams ] What ? Uh ... did I poke you ? No , it 's just cold against my skin . So check it out , Doobie . I got two of everything . For the twins . I once dated twins . It was so confusing , especially when they dress alike . Twins dress alike ? Well , these did . They were the Minnesota Twins . [ Woman ] Hello ! Oh ! It 's 7 : 00 . That must be Samantha . She 's the posh one . But I think she might be the most naughty . [ screams ] [ screams ] Sam ! It 's you ! You 're early ! Well , maybe a little bit . Is that a problem ? No ! Not at all . Here ! Let me show you around . This is the living room . This is the kitchen . And this is the bathroom . Here ya go . [ Sam yelps ] Why dontcha go in there . Oh , great . Now I have to go to the bathroom . Dick ? When you came to Earth ... was I your first ? Uh , no . I was . But you were a very distant second . Aw ... I can 't believe I 'm- - If I told my mother I was dating an alien , it would kill her . Dick ! Let 's call her . No ! No , no , no , no ! Mary , no ! Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's a secret . I 'm just so excited . I have so many questions ! Well , go ahead ! Did you build the pyramids ? Only the one in Las Vegas . What about Easter Island ? Easter Island was a practical joke that got out of hand . [ laughs ] I can 't believe my boyfriend 's an alien ! Dick ... on your planet ... how do you do it ? Well , it 's- - it 's similar to Earth . Typically , you launch a protoplasm capsule into your partner 's receptor port , and then wait for a ... an impact summary . Take me , spaceman ! I 'm screwed . Sam 's here early , and her sister Samantha 's due any minute . So you 're gonna go outside , and distract Samantha when she gets here . How can I do that ? Well , shiny objects usually work for me . [ laughs , door opens ] [ gasps ] [ shrieks ] Samantha ! You 're here , too . Too ? To ... eat ... in the kitchen ... where people always eat . Not in the bathroom . Where they hide . Stay calm . Harry , is something wrong ? No , I 'm havin ' a great time . And so are you . Now , why don 't you just sit here and count to 100 . No reason . Harry , where are you going ? To check on the ham . It 's in the bathroom . It 's an old family recipe . Sam , quick , you gotta get outta here . Harry , I didn 't see anybody . That 's because you missed her ! Now , come on . I want you to go in the bathroom and sneak Sam out , okay ? I think the other one might be hotter , anyway . Harry ? Yes ? What 's goin ' on ? Well , nothing . Let 's go eat . Isn 't the ham in the bathroom ? Yeah , that 's right . [ knocking ] Who 's that ? It 's the ham . [ knocking ] It must be ready . Harry , I know somebody 's in there . Look ... I got a confession to make . I made two dates tonight . You did ? Who 'd you make the other date with ? Oh , I can 't tell ya . It 's too sick . Hello . I wish you two all the luck in the world . Great . Now I lost Sam and Samantha . They took the ham ! I have listened to what you 've had to say . I have processed it . I 'm not gonna change my mind . I 'm gonna kill Albright . But you can 't ! Don 't worry . I 'll use the second most pain-free manner I can think of . Sally , she loves that we 're aliens . And she loves the secret . She thinks it 's sexy . Dick , as Security Officer , I have to take care of all security breaches . Any human who knows our true identity must die . Now , those are the rules , and I 'm stickin ' with ' em . Okay . Fine . You 're right . Okay , that 's very mature . Big news , Don . There 's something you should know about Sally , Tommy , Harry , and me . Okay , fine , fine ! I won 't kill her . But this conversation is not over , mister . Thank you . Sally , I really took your advice to heart . So I went down to the station and I made some changes . You volunteered for the anti-gang unit ? I 'm opening a muffin shop ! What ? Don , that 's ridiculous . You were meant to be a cop . Only in your dreams . Whenever I was at work , I was scared . But whenever I 'm around muffins ... not so much . Dick , get in here and tell Don what you were gonna tell him ! So it turns out that Sam and Samantha were the same person . Why are the crazy ones always attracted to me ? I still can 't believe Don traded in his badge for an apron and a whisk . I 'm just really worried he 's giving up his calling . Now that Mary knows about us , we should invite her up here to muse with us about the earth . Oh , this day just keeps getting better and better . You know , I 'll tell you something interesting about- - [ sounding like space signal ] Incoming message from the Big Giant Head . The Big Giant Head sends congratulations on a job well done . Nice . And notice of your mission 's imminent cancellation . Cancellation ? An inter-alien complaint has been lodged by Liam Neesom . As you know , the use of a weapon against another alien is a mission violation . He was gonna turn us into chimps ! He did it first ! It doesn 't matter who started it ! The Big Giant Head is telling you : The mission is over . Over ? No ! Yes ... and that 's final . You must leave by Saturday at midnight , when your earth bodies will expire .

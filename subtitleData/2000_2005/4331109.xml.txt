 Who left their dirty plate in the replicator ? Tom ? It wasn 't me . It 's a biohazard ! Take it easy ! We 'll decontaminate you when we get back home . If I ever volunteer for a two - week away mission again , would somebody please confine me to Sick Bay ? Too much togetherness for you , Harry ? Nothing personal , Commander . To tell you the truth , I 've enjoyed our little junket together . It 's given the four of us a chance to bond . The bonding stopped when the sonic shower went off - line . That 's all part of the experience , the adventure . Think of the great explorers that came before us . They survived without creature comforts . I wouldn 't want to bunk with them , either . Now , there 's a sight for sore eyes . Delta Flyer to Voyager . We 're on our approach . We 've kept a candle burning in the window for you . Forget the candles . Break out the champagne ! I take it the mission was a success . 15 planets scanned in 14 days . We 've got a cargo hold overflowing with dilithium ore . That 's the kind of news I like to hear . The explorers return . Welcome home . I should go away more often . I 'm not going anywhere for a long , long time . Homesick , Harry ? Well , let 's just say I 'm looking forward to a hot shower and a comfortable bed . Don 't forget to stop by Sick Bay for your checkup . Checkup ? For what ? Away team protocol . Crew members are required to submit to a physical if the mission lasts more than two weeks . Now ... who 's first ? I 'll let you know in the morning , Doctor . Why put off till tomorrow what you can do today ... Commander ? Mr. Paris ? I 've been working on a little surprise for you . Oh ! Naughty or nice ? Close your eyes . I like it already . Come on . So , what do you think ? A television set ! Circa 1956 . I replicated the components , but I assembled it myself . This ... is the remote control . You select what you want to watch by pressing this button . A slight problem . There were no remote controls in the 1950s . I took a little poetic license . Cartoon ! I found them in the ship 's database . Vacuum action ! Mop , mop Don 't stop ... What 's that ? Now , that is called a " jingle . " According to the research I did , they inserted them into the entertainment programs . I know , it 's confusing , but I kept them in for authenticity . I even replicated popcorn . Aw ... Mm ! Everything is perfect , except for one tiny detail . What ? You forgot the beer . I can fix that . You didn 't miss much while you were away . The Doctor gave a lecture on " lnsects lndigenous to the Delta Quadrant . " Uh - huh . It was pretty boring ... until Ensign Farley started snoring , and then no one could keep a straight face . Of course , the Doctor wasn 't at all amused . Oh ! Hockey . It was a shame that we had to cut the lecture short , but the warp core overloaded , and then the Borg invaded , and ... we were all assimilated . Mm - hmm . You haven 't heard a single thing I 've said , have you ? Oh ! Look at that ! Maybe this was a bad idea . It 's Eliot Ness ! Come on out ! We don 't want any trouble ! We 're the Barkers ! You 're never going to get us ! We 're under attack . Stay down ! Keep moving ! Somebody cover me ! Need a medic over here ! Move it ! Stay low ! Aah ! Hold your fire ! I said hold your fire ! I need a medic ! Keep moving ! Keep moving ! Tom ? Tom ? - Tom ? - Mm . Must 've been one hell of a dream . I was ... I was in the middle of a battlefield . I was grazed right ... right here . They always said television was a bad influence . How about a nice cartoon ? That should chase away the nightmare . No ! No , I think I 've had enough . Stay down ! Stay low ! It sounds like you had an anxiety attack . I 've never been claustrophobic before . There 's a first time for everything . Do you know what could 've caused it ? Let 's see ... you spend two weeks on an away mission , working 18 - hour days . Then , as soon as you return to Voyager , you become " Ensign Eager , " back on duty and rarin ' to go . I had work to do . There was a plasma leak on Deck 5 . Plasma leak or no plasma leak , you 're suffering from exhaustion . I 'm recommending you take the next two days off . But I ... I can always make it three . You win . Guess I am pretty tired . Ah . Welcome back . Hello . Did you have a good trip ? Wonderful , thank you . You look tired . Oh , no. lt 's just a little shuttle lag . Don 't you have a geometry lesson ? You don 't want to keep your teacher waiting . Seven of Nine assigned me a special project . I 'm supposed to build a tetragon , but I have to use everyday things . I 'm not allowed to use a replicator . I was thinking about using some vegetables from the Airponics Bay . Carrots and celery ? Neelix ? Carrots and celery . A good idea . Will you help me ? Uh ... I don 't think I 'll have time today . Tonight ? I don 't think that I 'll have time then , either . A lot of work to do ! Well , then , why don 't I help you ? What 's cooking ? Ouch ! Let me see your hand ! I 'm okay . Your hand ! We 've got to get you to Sick Bay . I 'm fine . Sick Bay ! That 's the best joke I 've ever heard . Get down . Stay behind me . What ? ! I said get down ! Go , go ! Quickly ! Come on ! Help me with this ! Keep moving ! Try not to move . Get away from me ! I can help you . I don 't ... want your help ! We need help over here ! Hold your fire . I said hold your fire ! We 're under attack , sir ! Saavdra - - where is he ? I think he 's at base . We were supposed to evacuate the colony , not destroy it ! That was before the Nakan started shooting . They 're civilians ! Civilians with particle weapons . Tuvok to Commander Chakotay . Commander , please respond . Go ahead . We have a security breach in the Mess Hall . I 'm on my way . Tell them to call off the attack ! Put down your weapon , Neelix . Let us help you . Stay away ! I won 't let you hurt her ! Get back ! He appears to be hallucinating . Neelix ! This is Commander Chakotay ! Let Naomi go ! No one 's going to hurt her ! That 's an order ! No ! Not until Saavdra 's called off his attack . There 's a back entrance to the galley . If you can distract him , perhaps ... I want to try something first . Neelix ! Listen to me. lt 's okay . Saavdra ordered a cease - fire . The colony 's secure . The battle 's over . Why do I still hear weapons fire ? It 's just a few soldiers . They 're celebrating . The battle 's over . Neelix , please . I 'll protect Naomi . How do I know you won 't trick me ? Because I 'm on your side . I want to end this conflict as much as you do . Let her go . It 's safe now . The killing 's over . I gave him a mild sedative . Any idea what caused the delusions ? His norepinephrine levels are three times what they should be . Neurochemically speaking , he 's suffering from a form of post - traumatic stress syndrome . I dreamed I was fighting in an alien war . The same war Neelix seemed to be reliving . Harry Kim was in earlier . He had an anxiety attack . I haven 't spoken with Mr. Paris yet . Three members of the same away team . Did you run into any kind of trouble while you were gone ? None . The mission was by the book . Your engramatic activities contradict that , Commander . These are real memories , not mere dreams or hallucinations . Maybe you were abducted ... manipulated into fighting . Our memories have been tampered with before . We 're going to retrace your mission . Start reviewing the Delta Flyer sensor logs . See if you come up with anything unusual . How long before Neelix is back on his feet ? I can wake him now if you 'd like . Do it . Each of you seems to hold a piece of the puzzle . Let 's see if we can start putting them together . I don 't remember much , just bits and pieces . I dreamt I was on a planet in the middle of a battle . I have no idea how I got there . I can 't remember . When I was in the Jefferies tube , I heard weapons fire , screams . People were screaming . I got so frightened . Of what ? I ... I don 't know . I remember getting shot . There 's no evidence of a wound . If our memories were wiped , our physical injuries could have been masked as well . Do any of you recall who you were fighting ? It was dark . I couldn 't see them very well . They were firing at us . The Naka ... Na ... Nakana ... Nakan . They were called the Nakan . Right . Right . They ... they lived in a remote colony . We were trying to evacuate them . But they were fighting us . Why couldn 't they just do what they were told ? We had no right to be there ! It was for their own good . Gentlemen , stay focused . You said you were trying to evacuate their colony . Why ? Those were our orders . Who gave them ? Saavdra . Commander Saavdra . He was in charge of our unit . We were part of an attack force . You were coerced ? No ! No , I volunteered . We all did . I find that difficult to believe . You were obviously manipulated somehow . No ! No , no , no , no , I remember now . We held a , uh , a briefing to plan the evacuation . You were there , Commander . Mr. Paris ! It was a command post . That 's right . It was night , 0200 hours . We 'd been awake for days . We were exhausted . What do our spotters report ? The Nakan are unarmed . They won 't put up a fight . Once we 've disabled their shield generators , we 'll deploy Units 5 and 6 . They may be unarmed , but they won 't be happy to see us . Don 't provoke them . I want to come out of this with zero casualties on both sides . Understood . The perimeter is the weakest in Sector 14 . The terrain 's very flat . It 's an ideal landing spot for transports . Once we 've secured the village , take the colonists there . Get them aboard . Do your best to reassure them . Make them understand that this is a temporary relocation , that they 're going to be back there within a few weeks . Understood . Yes , sir ! Aye , aye , sir . Problem ? Just one . This unit could use a little sleep . I suggest we wait until daybreak . I promised Command we 'd have this colony secured today . It can wait a few hours . I 'm sorry . But when this mission 's over , how does a week on Toranius Prime sound ? Never been there . Compared to this place , it 's paradise . The mission proceeded as planned . We disabled their shield generators and entered the colony . We were rounding up the Nakan . To be honest , I expected them to give us a little more trouble . But then we came to the last enclosure . Do you remember the last enclosure ? It was empty . Where were they ? They were supposed to be there . 24 colonists unaccounted for . We thought the spotters had made a mistake . We should 've known something was wrong . We should 've gotten out then . This way . Stay in line . Keep moving . Evacuation detail to base . We 're ready for transport . Transports on approach . Keep moving . I have to find my husband . Don 't worry . He 'll be on one of the transports . Which one ? I , I don 't know , but we 'll find him . Everybody down ! Base , we 're under attack . Repeat , we 're under attack . Those missing colonists , they were armed . They fired the first shots . It wasn 't our fault . You can 't be sure of that . It could 've been one of our own people . Fatigue , a phaser malfunction - - you just don 't know ! Either way , it doesn 't justify what we did . What did you do ? What happened down there ? Keep moving . Stay together ! Hold your fire ! Stay down ! Stay together ! Stop running ! Stop ! Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! Stop running ! Stop running ! Stop running ! Stop running ! Stop running ! I said stop ! We didn 't have any other choice . Like hell , we didn 't . They were wiping us out ! That didn 't give us the right to murder civilians . I tried to protect the children , but I couldn 't stop them from running away . I ran , too . Sounds of phaser fire , people shouting ... I had to get out of there . Please , please , don 't hurt us ! Move out where l can see you ! Move ! Please . Please , he 's no threat to you . Tell me how I can get out of these tunnels , and I 'll leave you alone . Tell me ! Oh ! Go back the way you came . At the second fork , take the tunnel to your left , follow it to the end . It will lead you to the river . He was going to kill me . Easy , Harry . They wouldn 't listen ! Why ? Why wouldn 't they listen ? We killed 82 civilians that night . No one was left alive . Captain 's Log , supplemental . We 've entered the system where the away team conducted its recent survey , hoping to find an explanation for their memories of the Nakan massacre . Yeah . Yeah ! Missed you at breakfast . I wasn 't hungry . Sleep a little ? Five ... six minutes . I found another episode of The Untouchables . Eliot Ness captures someone named Al Cay - pone . " Capone . " Maybe later . Well , you 've got to eat something . Pizza ? Look , I appreciate what you 're trying to do , but I 'd rather just be alone . Tom ... No ! I don 't want to be ... comforted right now . I know the last few days have been difficult . Oh . " Difficult . " " Difficult " doesn 't quite cover it . I helped murder 82 innocent people . You don 't know that . I know what I remember . The Doctor says your memories could have been altered . I was there ! When I close my eyes , I can see the bodies . I - l can hear the weapons fire ! I can feel where l was shot ! Then why isn 't there evidence of a war ... ? I don 't know ! All I 'm asking is that you consider the possibility that this didn 't happen . We 'll keep investigating . There are sensor readings on the Delta Flyer that we haven 't even analyzed yet . I - l can 't concentrate on sensor readings right now . Try . I can 't ! Stop pushing me ! I don 't want your help ! I 'm sorry . You know where to find me . This was your first stop on the away mission , a Class - M planet with one natural satellite . Did you send anyone to the surface ? No , we only scanned for dilithium deposits . We were in orbit for less than an hour . Next . You came into contact with this vessel en route to your second destination . Captain Bathar of Hodos . Photogenic . He 's a merchant . Claimed to have a formula that stops the aging process . Oh , you didn 't happen to buy any , did you ? It was only a tripolymer enzyme . Makes great shoe polish , though . Moving on . Your second stop . Tarakis . The planet , it 's called Tarakis . I 've been here . What the hell are you doing ? ! Stand aside . They 're already dead ! They were never here . We disabled their shield generators , entered the colony and they were gone . No one 's going to believe that . They will if we all keep to the same story . I won 't lie about what happened here . Then you say nothing . We murdered these people ! In self - defense ! If that were true , you wouldn 't be vaporizing the evidence ! You don 't have to listen to him . We 've got to let people know . We panicked ! They 'll understand ! No , they won 't ! Move away . I said move away ! How long have I been here ? Three hours . You started hallucinating in Astrometrics . I 'm afraid I had to sedate you . I was there . I was at the colony ... with Saavdra . You 're not the only one . 39 crew members have begun to experience the same memories . It appears that the entire crew has been affected . Their symptoms are identical - - increased engramatic activity , nightmares . I can imagine the away team being pulled into an alien conflict . But these people weren 't anywhere near this system . We 've analyzed Voyager 's sensor records . If we did participate in a war , all evidence of it has been erased . The dream was so vivid - - as real as anything I 've experienced . But I refuse to believe that we could ... Real or not , the memories are having a deleterious effect on the crew . The syndrome began to spread once we entered this system . I suggest we reverse course , before it gets worse . No. lf this massacre really happened , someone is to blame . I want to be certain that it wasn 't us . With all due respect , your judgment may be clouded by feelings of guilt about an incident that never occurred . The danger to our crew here and now , is indisputable . I 've seen you looking better , Ensign . Yes , ma 'am . I 've felt better myself , but we 're going to get through this . The massacre took place on Tarakis . Go to Red Alert and set a course . Aye , Captain . A neural suppressant . It 'll help keep the memories from resurfacing . Your favorites - - Talaxian stew and terra nut soufflé . The soufflé has collapsed slightly , but its nutritional content is intact . Thank you . It looks delicious . When Naomi Wildman is sad , she consumes desserts . She claims it improves her emotional state . Perhaps you should try it . Naomi must be terrified of me ... after what happened in the galley . She 's concerned about you . She told me she wants to visit you . No , not like this . I might do something to scare her again . I 'll give her your regards . Seven ... When you were a Borg , you were involved in some ... unpleasant activities . I helped to assimilate millions . I don 't mean to be insensitive , but ... do you ever feel shame about what you did ? Frequently . How do you manage to keep going , knowing that you 've done such horrible things ? I have no choice . Guilt is irrelevant ? On the contrary , my feelings of remorse help me remember what I did and prevent me from taking similar actions in the future . Guilt can be a difficult but useful emotion . It 's certainly difficult . is that chocolate mixed in there with the terra nuts ? I altered the recipe slightly . I hope you don 't object . Not at all . Tarakis , dead ahead . Shields . Stand by weapons . On screen . Scan for vessels . There are none . Take us into orbit . Ma 'am ? Do it , Mr. Paris . Life signs ? The planet appears to be uninhabited . Looks the same as it did a few days ago , when we scanned for dilithium deposits . Signs of weapons fire or phaser residue ? Negative . Run a full spectral scan . Look for anything unusual . Nothing on geometric sensors . Hold on . I 'm picking up a power signature . - Source ? - l can 't tell . The signal 's erratic , but it 's coming from the northernmost continent , coordinates 172 mark 5 . Phasers . Call it an educated guess , but I don 't think this looks like a war zone . There 's something familiar about it though . I recognize those mountains . Those trees weren 't here . Search the area . Ensign ? The tunnel . It 's nearby . The one where l , uh ... How 'd you get into it ? There was a rock formation . It hid the opening . A faint energy signature . This way . Over here . There 's your physical evidence . I suggest we proceed with caution . Stand guard . I ... I ... I can 't . Remain calm . Slow , deep breaths . They were over there . I found the remains of two humanoids , but you were not responsible for their deaths . They died over 300 years ago . I think we found our war . The structure contains a synaptic transmitter . I believe it was designed to send neurogenic pulses throughout this system . So anyone passing through would experience the Nakan massacre ... like we did . Precisely . Try running those symbols inscribed on the base through the translation matrix . " Words alone cannot convey the suffering . " Words alone cannot prevent " what happened here from happening again . " Beyond words lies experience . " Beyond experience lies truth . " Make this truth your own . " It 's a memorial . We weren 't victims of a conspiracy . We were witnesses to a massacre . More than witnesses . By being forced to relive those events , half the crew 's been traumatized . Maybe that was the point . I certainly won 't forget what happened here . Anything in that database that might tell us who built this thing ? No . The technology has been neglected for more than two centuries . Its power cells are deteriorating . That could explain why our memories were so fragmented . It was probably designed to transmit the experience in sequence . Fascinating . Now let 's try to shut it down so nobody else has to go through this . Kathryn ? Yes , of course . Even if we do shut down the transmitter , I 'm afraid your memories of the massacre are permanent . But we 'll prevent this from happening to other passing ships . If we do that , all record of what happened here would be lost . The monument will still be here . But that doesn 't really tell the story . Someone put a lot of time and care into building that transmitter . We can 't just deactivate it . We don 't have the right . Did they have the right to force us to relive all that ? They wanted others to know what it was like , in the hopes that nothing like it would happen again . Why should anyone have to experience an atrocity they didn 't commit ? Because that 's how you learn not to make the same mistake . If we destroy the evidence , we 're no better than Saavdra . Maybe he had a point . It wasn 't our fault . Given the danger involved , it 's only logical ... This isn 't about logic ! It 's about remembering ! Some things are best forgotten . Not this . I stood by once before and did nothing . Not again . Captain ? I watched while Saavdra vaporized the bodies . No offense , but those were other people 's memories . The Obelisk at Khitomer , the fields at Gettysburg , those were other people 's memories , too , but we don 't honor them any less . The 82 colonists who died here ... they deserve their memorial . Captain ... We 're not going to shut down the transmitter. ls that clear ? is that clear ? Are you suggesting we leave it intact ? I 'm suggesting that we repair it . Recharge the power cells . I want that monument to function properly for another 300 years . We 'll place a warning buoy in orbit . Anyone who enters this system will know what to expect . Dismissed . We 're ready , Captain . I know this was hardest on the four of you , but if you hadn 't stopped at this planet , all the people who died here would have been forgotten . And if they could , I know they 'd thank you . Janeway to Voyager . Stand by to initiate power transfer . Five to beam up .

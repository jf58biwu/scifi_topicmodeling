 We live in a darkness of our own making blind to a habitant world all but unseen by us . A world of beings traveling through time and space imaginable to us only as flights of fancy . Who are these beings we dare to imagine but fear to accept ? What dark work goes on inside their impossible machines cloaked from us by invisible forces ? If they know our secrets , why can 't we know theirs ? Stop it ! Please ! Let me go ! Stop it ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let the boy go ! Let him go , Mulder ! Let him go , or I will be compelled to use my weapon . Now , I don 't want to do that , Agent Mulder . I don 't want to shoot . Now , are you armed ? Come on , damn it . This is just stupid , Agent Mulder . Don 't turn this into a movie . Just tell me if you 've got a gun . It 's too hot for this B.S. All right , then , lie down . Lie down on the ground . Keep your hands out . Lay down on your belly there . For crying out loud , what are you doing ? Agent Mulder , stay there ! He went over ! Over the edge ! Who ? Mulder . Right , I 'll talk to Scully . You guys head back to the school . Where is he ? Where 's Mulder ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? I heard an agent say over the radio that you saw him . Oh , yeah , I saw him . I saw him back right off that cliff there and I saw him fall right over there . - Then where is he ? - He 's gone . - Come on , he can 't be gone . - Yeah , he can 't be , but he is . That cliff there ? He fell from there ? It 's impossible a fall like that . A cop sees things . A man drops five stories , dusts his hat off and goes back to work . An old lady gets shot point-blank in a Chinese restaurant , plucks the slug out of her egg foo young . But even if Mulder survives this , what he does then is too much . You got your point of impact there where Agent Scully is standing clear and identifiable . And a set of tracks here leading down to the wash . Look at these tracks . What do you see ? Mulder was running . It wasn 't Mulder . That 's the one thing I 'm sure of . It may have looked like Mulder , but it wasn 't Mulder . I told you I knew Mulder . Okay , maybe I didn 't know him that well . But I know who it was up there , and it was Fox Mulder . I 'm sure it did look like Mulder , and you have every reason to believe that it was him but it was not Mulder . I told you that I 've seen things ... Things that I can 't explain . Well , I have seen what looks like a man transform into another man . What looks like a man , but who 's not a man ? - So , what is he ? - You don 't want to know . He 's not a man ? What the hell is he ? Hey , don 't turn your back on me . I 'm asking you a legitimate question . He 's alien . He 's a bounty hunter . Looking to collect a bounty on ... ? On Gibson Praise because he 's part alien . He 's a human anomaly . So , this alien bounty hunter he disguised himself as Mulder to come out here and grab the boy ? To take him back to his ship where we believe Mulder is . You know , Agent Scully you 're , uh , you 're starting to remind me a lot of Agent Mulder yourself . Well then , you explain it to me . If it 's true or possible , what you 're saying- - that there 's someone like this out there , this bounty hunter- - he could just become anyone . You , me , any damn one of us . I think that it is true . And possible . And wherever Mulder is right now he better damn well be smiling . Right . They 're here . Any sign of him ? Mulder ? Not according to these people . We went through the school . - You 're better than this . - Sir ? He 's got to be here somewhere . Let 's search the school again . Hello ? Sorry , I thought you were ... I thought they cleared you out of here . Find something ? No . Let 's keep looking . - Administration building is clear . - Copy , check it again . What I want to know is how Doggett got out here . How did he even know where we were going ? I don 't know . But he 's going to turn this place upside down looking for the wrong person . What happened to Gibson Praise ? Whatever happened to him , he 's long gone . Wherever he is , he 's three steps ahead of us . Don 't look now but we 've got a pair of eyeballs on us . Just start walking , I 'll be right behind you . Can I talk to you for a minute ? You shouldn 't have come here . You shouldn 't have come . You 'll lead them to me . I 'm here to protect you , Gibson . I know you know that 's the truth . I know you know my thoughts . I know they took the man you work with ... Mulder . And now , they 've come to take me . The only reason they want to take you , Gibson is because you 're a special boy . They want to take you because of what you are . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know that someone was following me . My friend Thea knows . She 's the only one at school I 've told . She says the FBI is looking for me , too . She 's afraid for me . She has a right to be afraid . We don 't know who to trust now . I fell when I was running away . I think you might have broken it , Gibson . If they find me , they 'll take me . I know it . I 've always known it . I 'm going to make you a splint , Gibson , okay ? I can set your leg , but , uh ... I 'm going to need a car to get you out of here . I 'm going to come back for you . I promise . I 'm not going to let anything bad happen to you . You said that to me once before . Yeah ? Deputy Director , for you . Yeah , this is John Doggett . Agent Doggett , I 'm getting reports from Arizona ... Yes , sir . ... That you found Agent Mulder . I 'm afraid somebody jumped the gun on that . I saw him , sir , but I ... What do you mean , you saw him ? What the hell is going on out there ? Well , we 're ' round the clock here . I 've got local SAR , a rolling ground cordon and an eye in the sky . - We 're on top of the situation . - How does the FBI find a man and then lose him in the middle of the desert ? 'Cause I 'd like to know . - Agent Doggett , are you there ? - Yeah . I heard the question . I put you in charge out there , Doggett . Now do the damn job . This amuse you ? I amuse you ? No . It just made sense to me . How you found your way out here . Who led you to Gibson Praise . You think I was spying on you ? No , but I think our new Deputy Director was . You 're being made a pawn in a rigged game . All right , you 've painted me the picture , now put it in a frame . All right . You 've got a good rep , Agent Doggett . You don 't compromise , you don 't quit . You 're a damned good FBI agent- - best of the best . Lot of guys put you in the Director 's chair one day . Which is why you 've been set up to fail . There 's no amount of search and rescue or rolling cordons or eyes in the sky that are going to turn up Mulder . It 's just the wrong approach . It 's not a question of approach . It 's the only approach I got . The only way you 're going to find Mulder is to give into the truth . To listen to Scully . But even then ... say you did find him , even then you lose . You put anything about aliens or UFOs or alien bounty hunters in your report Kersh will ruin you . I 'm betting that was his plan . Is Agent Scully here ? Where 's Agent Scully ? I need someone who 's with Agent Scully to put her on a radio . Someone ... with Agent Scully . Anyone got a twenty on Agent Scully ? Is anyone out there with her ? I 'm with Agent Scully . Then who 's this ? Go for Agent Scully . What ? Give me the radio . - You 're with Scully ? - Right across the room from her . From who ? From me ? Where ? - What room ? Where are you ? - Bunkhouse . We 're in the dorm . Tell him to hold her . Tell them not to let her out of his sight ! Hold Scully . We 're coming to you . Agent Scully- - There she is . Do you see her ? Where did she go ? Did you see her ? No . She ran right back here ! I saw her ! You saw her ! Agent ... Can you breathe ? He thinks it was me . He thinks that I did this to him . How is that possible ? It 's someone in this room . Agent Scully ? Where are you going ? Agent Scully ? Get out of the car . Agent Scully ! - Who are you ? - Who am I ? Drop your weapon and turn around . - I 'm not gonna turn around . - Just do it ! I know how it works- - Kill shot to the back of the neck . Scully , you 're pointing your weapon at a friend . Turn around , or I 'm going to assume that you 're not who you say you are . Scully , it 's me ! Skinner ! I can prove it . I know your secret- - who else knows it ? Okay ... then tell me . You tell me . How do I know it 's you ? I don 't like pointing guns at pregnant women any more than I like them pointing guns at me . This has gone too far , Scully . No . That 's what 's wrong here . It hasn 't gone far enough . I need those car keys . And what do you think you 're going to do ? Look , we are being hampered here by the FBI , by John Doggett , by doubt , by our own mistrust . Whatever it is , it is working ... as long as we let it . You told me Mulder wouldn 't allow it . Wouldn 't let me ruin my career over this . Over him . But what about you , Scully ? I mean , my God , you 've got even more at stake . I can 't take the chance that I 'm never going to see him again . Mulder could just come walking out of the dark- - we don 't know . Look ... we 've got one last chance here waiting for us out there in the desert- - Gibson Praise . It may just be who gets to him first . Get in the car . I 'll drive . Gibson ! He 's not down there . I told him to stay here . He was supposed to stay here . I found him . What are you doing out here ? Why didn 't you answer me , huh ? He 's here . I hear him . What are you talking about ? Mulder . He 's somewhere out there . He 's got a really bad fever . I think his leg might be infected . All right , we got to get you to the hospital , okay , buddy ? You 're so close now . I 'll carry you . Put your arm around my neck . Watch your legs . Agent Scully . - You take him to the hospital . - What about you ? I got a boy here who needs emergency medical attention ! What ? Are you okay ? What 's wrong ? It 's okay , Gibson , lie down . Lie down . Oh , my God . For someone who claims he 's not following me , you sure have a knack . - Hey , you 're where the action is . - What does that tell you ? That I 'm crazy or that I 'm right ? Wandering around in the desert in the dead of night , you call it . You say you want to find Mulder but you won 't do what it takes . - You 're afraid that I 'm right . - I 'm not afraid of anything . Except that maybe Mulder 's got even you believing in this crap now . You 've seen this crap for yourself now . How do you explain what took place today ? Let me ask you something hypothetically . If you were to find him out here or this ship or this alien bounty hunter , what would you do then ? I know what Agent Mulder would do . - He 'd do whatever it took . - You mean lie . Like you 've been lying to me . And flout orders like you 've done every step of the way on this thing . Is that what it takes , Agent Scully ? Give a little , get a little , Agent Doggett ! You knew where the kid was , you knew where the kid was and you wouldn 't tell me- - why ? - What kid ? I don 't see any kid . - You 're lying to me again ! Assistant Director Skinner took him from here to the hospital . How do you know that ? There 's one thing I know for sure in this case and that 's that Mulder is after this boy Gibson Praise . Why ? It beats the hell out of me . But when he goes after that kid , my men are going to be waiting for him . Your men ... followed Assistant Director Skinner ? Hey , where you going ? - Agent Scully , where you going ? - Your men are at the hospital ? They got it controlled . Nobody goes in or out of that building without them knowing about it . How do you know that they 're your men ? Where 's the boy ? Door at the end of the hall , with AD Skinner . Are you certain about that ? Why don 't you get yourself a visual in the exterior window . The night nurse has been checking the boy every 20 minutes- - he 's fine . We have hospital personnel going about their business . We 're just laying back , waiting for Mulder . Yeah , every minute that you wait , that boy 's in danger . He 's exposed . No one 's getting past us , Agent Scully . No one 's gotten past us . You believe that , Agent Doggett ? Hey , if something tries to rip your throat out , I got you covered . A.D. Skinner ... This is John Doggett . What the hell is this ? - What the hell is going on ? ! - There 's no one in that room . I 'm looking for a patient , a boy , 12 years old . He may still be in this building . The window doesn 't even open . How 's a grown man and a boy get out of the room except by that door ? Agent Scully . It 's okay , I 've got him . Gibson . How did you get here ? How did you get him out of that room ? We went up through the ceiling . I don 't know who to trust . Where is he ? He 's right here . They 're going to find him . Agent Scully ! An agent needs help ! I said an agent needs help ! The best I can say is it 's lucky it all happened at a hospital . Very lucky , yes , Sir . I assume the hazardous materials or chemicals which caused this must have been medical . That has not yet been determined , Sir . So much here is undetermined as remain the whereabouts of Mulder . But some of your ... facts like " a man falls from the cliff and disappears ... " " An agent has his throat crushed by an assailant who vanishes into thin air . " This reads like a piece of pot-boiled science fiction . You mean it reads like an X-File . But that 's what you intended , wasn 't it , Sir ? When you assigned me to the case . I 'll ask the questions , John . You just give me some damn answers . Don 't come back until you do . My dad always said it 's not who wins or loses it 's who takes the worst beating that counts . That supposed to cheer me up ? I thought so . But then I never did get to see your opponent . And you never will . You still don 't believe me . What I don 't believe is how long they 're keeping you here . Oh , it 's just some things they have to check out make sure of . Well , I 've got some things I thought you 'd want checked out . A.D. Skinner is in stable condition , resting comfortably and awaiting diagnosis and further study . Ditto Agent Landau , his throat . Gibson Praise is right now a ward of the state but I asked for special protections , as I assumed you would yourself . What are you doing here , Agent Doggett ? Keeping you apprised of the case . That 's not your job . It is , actually . And officially . I 'm assigned now to the X-Files . Whatever you and I may differ on , I 'll find him , Agent Scully .

 THIS IS K.U.R.D.Y. , BREAKER , BREAKER , 1-9 . COME ON , MAN , DON 'T BE MESSING AROUND . MAN , REMEMBER THERE WAS A TIME YOU COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE IN YOUR CAR AND HEAR MUSIC ON THE RADIO ? AND IF THERE WAS A SONG PLAYING YOU DIDN 'T LIKE , YOU COULD JUST CHANGE THE CHANNEL . SCOUT TEAM ONE , THIS IS BASE CAMP . DO YOU COPY ? YEAH , ERIN , WE 'RE HERE . WHAT 'S YOUR 20 ? JUST FINISHED DROPPING OFF SUPPLIES AT CLARKSON . WE 'RE HEADING OUR WAY BACK . SORRY , FLAG ON THE PLAY , GUYS . MARCUS NEEDS YOU TO PICK SOMEONE UP ON THE WAY HOME , BRING HIM IN . ONE OF OURS ? NO , AN OUTSIDER . AN OUT ... AN OUTSIDER ? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO RULE NUMBER ONE : DON 'T BRING ANYBODY IN ? REALLY . WHO IS IT ? NOT ON AN OPEN CHANNEL , JUST TO BE SAFE . YOU 'LL PICK UP YOUR TARGET OUTSIDE NEW RIVER . WAIT BY THE OLD GAS STATION ON THE EDGE OF TOWN . TAKE THE LONG WAY BACK . BE PREPARED TO BLINDFOLD THE TARGET BEFORE YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO BASE . WE 'LL CONTACT YOU LATER WITH MORE DETAILS . BASE CAMP TO K.U.R.D.Y. SIGNING OFF . WE 'VE GOT A POLICY OF KEEPING THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THE DARK ABOUT OUR ACTIVITIES AND OUR LOCATION . THAT 'S ABOUT TO CHANGE . I 'VE DECIDED TO BRING IN SOME PEOPLE FROM THE OUTSIDE INTO THUNDER MOUNTAIN : LOCAL LEADERS , PEOPLE WHO 'VE BEEN ABLE TO FORM COMMUNITIES . IS EVERYONE ELSE ON BOARD WITH THIS ? NOT YET . I 'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO TELL THEM . MY FATHER FELT THAT THIS PLACE WAS WHERE THE NEW WORLD WOULD START . HE 'D ROLL OVER IN HIS GRAVE IF WE WASTED IT , OR WORSE , ALLOWED IT TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF VALHALLA 'S ARMY . THESE PEOPLE , THESE OUTSIDERS , ARE THEY GOOD PEOPLE ? CAN YOU TRUST THEM ? I 'D NEVER KNOWINGLY BRING ANYBODY INTO THUNDER MOUNTAIN THAT WOULD HARM US . WAS THAT A YES ... OR A NO ? C-C-CORRECT ME IF I 'M WRONG , BUT DID LEE CHEN OR DID HE NOT BLOW A GASKET THE LAST TIME WE BROUGHT SOMEBODY BACK TO THE MOUNTAIN ? WHOEVER THIS CAT IS , MARCUS MUST REALLY TRUST HIM . I JUST WISH HE 'D HURRY HIS ASS UP . YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF OUR TIME IS WASTED JUST WAITING FOR WHATEVER SHIT 'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US TO UP AND FINALLY HAPPEN ? YEAH . OH , SHIT ! WELL , SWEET MARIE ! LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED BACK . IT 'S OK , BOYS , YOU CAN PUT YOUR GUNS DOWN . I THINK WE SCARED ' EM STRAIGHT . THEO , WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? YOU 'RE MY RIDE , SWEETIES . HER RIDE ? OH , HELL , MAN . HELL , NO . MAN , I WOULD RATHER POKE MY EYE OUT THAN TAKE HER BACK TO THUNDER MOUNTAIN . WELL , YOU BETTER START LOOKING FOR A SHARP STICK , SUGAR , 'CAUSE THEO IS COMING TO OZ . DEAR DAD , IT 'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE THE BIG DEATH WIPED OUT EVERYONE OVER THE AGE OF INNOCENCE ... THE END OF YOUR WORLD , THE BEGINNING OF MINE . GOOD AFTERNOON , ERIN . YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME . WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ? I 'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE POWER ALLOCATIONS . COUNCIL 'S BACKED UP ON SUPPLY REPORTS , SO MUCH STUFF GOING OUT THE DOORS , INVENTORY TO DO ... I LOST TRACK OF TIME . SORRY . SO HOW 'S MARCUS THESE DAYS ? WHY DO YOU ASK ? WHY DO YOU ANSWER EVERY QUESTION WITH A QUESTION ? BECAUSE HAVING SPENT 2 YEARS ALONGSIDE YOU ON THE COUNCIL , I 'VE LEARNED THAT EVERY QUESTION IS A TRICK QUESTION . HONEST TO A FAULT . DISAGREEABLE BUT FASCINATING QUALITY . I 'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEVER GOT TOGETHER . WELL , LET 'S SEE . WHY DID TANYA BREAK UP WITH YOU ? I DON 'T KNOW . MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS SLEEPING AROUND , ALWAYS LATE , ALWAYS LATE BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING AROUND . YOU STILL HAVEN 'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION . BECAUSE YOU 'RE NOT HIS BIGGEST FAN . WHAT , IS IT A RULE NOW THAT WE HAVE TO LIKE OR AGREE WITH SOMEONE ALL THE TIME BEFORE WE CAN ASK HOW THEY 'RE DOING ? COME ON . HE 'S FINE . HE 'S JUST REALLY BUSY . HE 'S GOT A LOT ON HIS PLATE . BETWEEN REVIEWING REPORTS ON THE D-SECTOR SUPPORT BEAM , WHICH I THINK IS GONNA COLLAPSE ANY DAY NOW , WORKING- - I HEAR HE 'S BRINGING STRANGERS INTO THUNDER MOUNTAIN . HOW DID YOU- - A LITTLE BIRD WHISPERED IT TO ME THIS AFTERNOON . A LITTLE BIRD WITH A BIG MOUTH . AND I SEE YOU 'RE NOT DENYING IT . THIS IS THE SORT OF THING YOU SHOULD REALLY TALK TO MARCUS ABOUT . LOOK , YOU 'RE HERE , MARCUS ISN 'T . YOU 'RE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL . I 'M CHAIRMAN OF THAT COUNCIL . YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON 'T , SOMETHING I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW . NOW , ERIN , WE CAN DO THIS ONE OF 2 WAYS . I CAN MAKE A BIG , MESSY DEAL OUT OF THIS , OR YOU CAN BE STRAIGHT WITH ME AND SAVE EVERYONE A LOT OF GRIEF . MARCUS WAS GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT IT . YEAH , I 'M SURE HE WAS . LOOK , THIS HAS TO STAY BETWEEN US FOR NOW , UNTIL MARCUS CAN BRIEF THE COUNCIL , ALL RIGHT ? OF COURSE . HE 'S ASKED SEVERAL RECON TEAMS TO BRING IN 3 LOCAL LEADERS . HE WANTS TO TELL THEM ABOUT VALHALLA SECTOR , EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT WE HAVE A MUTUAL ENEMY . HE WANTS TO SEE HOW THIS MEETING WILL GO ON A SMALLER SCALE BEFORE HE SETS UP THE BIG ONE . WHAT BIG ONE ? SO , YOU , UH , MISS ME , JEREMIAH ? YEAH . YEAH , I DID . IT 'S LIKE , UH , HAVING MY NUTS STAPLED TO A DESK . AW , YOU SAY THE SWEETEST THINGS . LOOK , I GOT A GOOSE BUMP . WHY THE HELL ARE WE TAKING YOU TO THUNDER MOUNTAIN ? HEY , YOU DON 'T WANT TO APPRECIATE ME , THAT 'S YOUR PREROGATIVE . BUT YOU 'D BETTER SHOW ME A LITTLE RESPECT , OTHERWISE THIS SOIREE YOUR PEEPS ARE PLANNING , IT 'S GONNA GO BAD , REAL BAD . ARE YOU READING MY E-MAIL HERE , SUGARS ? BETTER . IT LOOKS LIKE , UH , SOMEONE THERE AT THE END OF THE WORLD WANTS TO SEE ME , SO WE CAN DISCUSS PUTTING THEO BACK IN HER RIGHT POSITION , RUNNING CLAREFIELD . APPARENTLY , THEY DON 'T THINK THEY CAN WORK WITH THE CREEP THAT BOUNCED ME OUT . SEE , I GOT PEOPLE SKILLS . WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF THIS ? I DON 'T KNOW , HONEY . THAT 'S ALL THE MESSAGE SAID . UH-OH , PULL OVER . I GOTTA PEE . YES , MA 'AM . LOOK , I 'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF THIS , MAN . SO IF YOU PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL , WE COULD BE DUST BEFORE SHE GETS HER PANTIES DOWN . DO YOU THINK SHE WEARS PANTIES ? I HEARD THAT . SORRY I 'M LATE . I WAS JUST- - MARCUS , WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING OUTSIDERS INTO THUNDER MOUNTAIN ? IS THIS TRUE ? IT 'S TRUE THAT I 'VE ASKED SOME OF OUR TEAMS TO BRING IN 3 OF THE MORE INFLUENTIAL LEADERS OF HIGH-PROFILE GROUPS . I WANT TO DISCUSS THE VIABILITY OF BRINGING TOGETHER AS MANY OF THESE LOCAL LEADERS AS POSSIBLE TO A KIND OF ... TO A KIND OF SUMMIT . WHY ? WE 'VE ALREADY STARTED SENDING OUT RESOURCES AND MAKING ALLIANCES , BECAUSE THAT 'S THE BEST CHANCE WE HAVE OF STANDING UP TO VALHALLA SECTOR , BUT IT 'S ALL PIECEMEAL . THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IS TO BAND THESE GROUPS TOGETHER AND BRIEF THEM ON WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW . WE DON 'T STAND A CHANCE OF SUCCESS WITHOUT THE HELP OF GROUPS LIKE THIS . AND AT WHAT POINT DID YOU PLAN ON LETTING YOUR ADVISERS VOTE ON THIS COURSE OF ACTION ? THAT 'S WHAT I 'M DOING NOW . NO . WHAT YOU 'RE DOING NOW IS INFORMING US OF WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE DONE . MARCUS , AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS TO HAVE SUPPORT FOR YOUR IDEAS OUT THERE , YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE SUPPORT FROM US IN HERE . AND I HAVE IT , DON 'T I ? YES , BUT ONLY TO A POINT . MARCUS , THIS IS NOT A DICTATORSHIP . THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE AFFECT ALL OF US . I 'VE DEDICATED 15 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO THIS PLACE , TO MAKING SURE THAT EVERY DECISION I MAKE IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE . AND I 'M SURE THAT 'S HOW YOU FEEL , BUT YOUR ACTIONS SPEAK OTHERWISE . THIS COUNCIL WAS FORMED TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HERE HAS A VOICE . THE PEOPLE THAT VOTE US INTO THIS COUNCIL EACH YEAR TRUST THAT WE SPEAK FOR THEM , AND WE CAN 'T DO IT IF WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON . MARCUS , YOU CAN 'T DENY THAT YOU OFTEN MAKE DECISIONS WITH VERY LITTLE REGARD FOR THIS COUNCIL . WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST ? THAT YOU SEND THESE PEOPLE BACK TO WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM UNTIL THE COUNCIL 'S HAD TIME TO DISCUSS THE RAMIFICATIONS . WE DON 'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME . IN ADDITION , I STRONGLY URGE THIS COUNCIL TO TAKE A LONG , HARD LOOK AT WHO WILL LEAD US INTO THE FUTURE , AND WHO WILL WORK WITH US TO HELP DECIDE THE SHAPE OF THAT FUTURE . YOU 'RE RIGHT , MARCUS . YOU 'VE BEEN AT THE HELM FOR 15 YEARS . MAYBE IT 'S TIME TO LET SOMEBODY ELSE CARRY THAT BURDEN FOR A WHILE . YOU CAN 'T BE SERIOUS . AS CHAIRMAN OF THIS COUNCIL , I 'M CALLING AN EMERGENCY SESSION TOMORROW AT 3 : 00 . THAT SHOULD GIVE EVERYONE A CHANCE TO CONSIDER THEIR OPTIONS . I PLAN ON CALLING FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE , TO BE FOLLOWED BY AN ELECTION FOR A NEW LEADER FOR THUNDER MOUNTAIN . YOU OK , MARCUS ? NO , I 'M NOT OK , LEE . WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU DURING THAT MEETING ? I STAND WITH YOU , MARCUS . I ALWAYS HAVE . YOU DIDN 'T SAY ONE WORD IN MY DEFENSE . IT WAS A TACTICAL DECISION . I FEEL MY ACTIONS ALLOW ME TO WORK AS A BRIDGE , BRINGING THE 2 SIDES TOGETHER . LET 'S FACE IT . IT WOULDN 'T HURT TO HAVE SOMEONE YOU TRUST ON THE INSIDE . AND YOU REALLY THINK BY SAYING NOTHING , THE COUNCIL CONSIDERS YOU NEUTRAL ? IT 'S THE ONLY CARD I HAD TO PLAY . I PLAYED IT . WHAT DO YOU SEE AS OUR NEXT MOVE , LEE ? GO ALONG WITH THE COUNCIL 'S RECOMMENDATION TO CANCEL THE MEETING . NO WAY ! IT 'LL BE SEEN AS A GESTURE OF GOOD FAITH . WE CAN HAVE AN OPEN FORUM ON THE ISSUE , ANSWER THE CONCERNS , GET THE SUPPORT OF THE COUNCIL , AND THEN PROCEED . WE 'LL GET WHAT WE WANT IN THE LONG RUN . WE 'RE OUT OF LONG RUNS , LEE . WE 'LL LOSE VALUABLE TIME , AND IT 'LL NEVER GET DONE . I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT . I 'LL COMPROMISE . GO TO THE COM ROOM . TELL OUR SCOUT TEAMS NOT TO ABORT , BUT TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE UNTIL RECEIVING FURTHER INSTRUCTION . TELL THEM TO DO THIS BY ORDER OF ANDREW AND THE COUNCIL . WHY ? WELL , IT 'S THE TRUTH , ISN 'T IT ? THEY SAY THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE . OH , AND LEE ... MAKE SURE YOU PERSONALLY DELIVER THE NEWS TO JEREMIAH AND KURDY . ONE THING 'S FOR SURE , THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS TOO WELL , CONSIDERING THE COMPANY THEY 'RE KEEPING . NO , THEY WON 'T TAKE IT WELL AT ALL . YOU TAKING THE LONG WAY AROUND , AREN 'T YOU ? I CAN TELL . WHEN DO WE GET TO PUT THE GAG ON HER ? SEE , WE DON 'T . THAT 'S THE PROBLEM . GAG ME ? WELL , GAG ON THIS : I DID NOT GET UP AT THE CRACK OF SPARROW-FART TO BE MUZZLED BY YOU TWO . AND WHY THE HELL DON 'T Y 'ALL HAVE SOME FOOD UP IN HERE ? ROVER ONE , THIS IS BASE CAMP . IT 'S ABOUT TIME . WHAT 'S UP ? WE 'RE ASKING ALL OF THE TEAMS TO MAINTAIN A HOLDING PATTERN AT THIS TIME . WE 'LL CALL YOU IF WE DECIDE TO PROCEED WITH THE ORIGINAL PLAN . IF ? WAIT--WAIT . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " IF " ? EX-SQUEEZE ME ? I THINK WE HAVE A BAD CONNECTION . DID YOU JUST TELL THEO SHE 'S NOT COMING OVER TO YOUR HOUSE TO PLAY ? I DON 'T THINK SO . I THINK YOU MIGHT BE PLAYING SOME KINDA FREAKIN ' HEAD GAME WITH ME . AM I RIGHT ? GIVE ME THAT THING . GIVE IT . LEE , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? WHERE THE HELL IS MARCUS ? MARCUS HAS INSTRUCTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT THIS ORDER COMES DIRECT FROM THE ADVISORY COUNCIL . SINCE WHEN DOES THE ADVISORY COUNCIL HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH US ? I 'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I CAN . DO NOT COME HERE UNTIL OTHERWISE INSTRUCTED BY ANDREW KINCAID , THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL . ANDREW ? THAT GUY 'S A PRICK . HE 'S BEEN NOTHING BUT A THORN IN MARCUS ' PAW SINCE DAY ONE . THIS IS FUCKED UP . YOU THINK SO ? WOULD YOU- - SHUT UP ! LOOK , FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED , WE ONLY ANSWER TO MARCUS . HE BROUGHT US IN , HE GAVE US THE JOB , AND THAT 'S THAT . YEAH . COME ON , WE 'RE GOING HOME . MY MAN . ERIN , HI . I- - I SPOKE TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE . YOU ABUSED THAT TRUST , ANDREW . I SHOULD 'VE KNOWN BETTER . I SHOULD 'VE KNOWN NOT TO TRUST YOU . MARCUS IS BECOMING A WILD CARD . THIS HAS BEEN COMING FOR A LONG TIME NOW . EVERYONE HERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS . YOU DON 'T SEE IT , BECAUSE YOU 'RE TOO CLOSE TO THE SITUATION . WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN ? OH , COME ON , ERIN . EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT YOU TWO . YOU 'RE ALWAYS LAUGHING AND TALKING ALL THE TIME , HMM ? THERE ARE NO SECRETS IN THE MOUNTAIN . I DON 'T BELIEVE WHAT I 'M HEARING . MARCUS PUT ME AS 2ND IN COMMAND 'CAUSE I 'M A HARD WORKER . I 'M NOT SLEEPING WITH HIM- - AN--AND WHAT IN THE HELL DOES ANY OF THIS GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING ? IT 'S JUST YOU 'VE LOST YOUR OBJECTIVITY . OR THAT 'S WHAT YOU WANT TO THINK , BECAUSE IT 'LL HELP THIS LITTLE POLITICAL ASSASSINATION OF YOURS GO DOWN EASIER . YOU 'VE WANTED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THIS PLACE SINCE YOU GOT HERE . OH , PLEASE , ERIN . WHAT 'S WRONG WITH THAT ? DO A HELL OF A LOT BETTER JOB THAN MARCUS RIGHT NOW . AND I 'LL BET YOU 'LL BE NICE AND OBJECTIVE , EVEN THOUGH HE 'S YOUR BROTHER . THAT 'S ENOUGH , ERIN . THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MARCUS , WHATEVER THAT IS OR ISN 'T . THIS IS ABOUT MARCUS PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK . HE HAS TO BE STOPPED . FOR THAT , YOU 'RE GOING TO NEED A MAJORITY VOTE FROM THE COUNCIL , AND I 'M GOING TO FIGHT YOU EVERY INCH OF THE WAY . MARCUS , WE HAVE A PROBLEM . JUST ONE ? JEREMIAH AND KURDY ARE AT THE GATE REQUESTING ACCESS . WE TURNED OFF THEIR KEY-CARD AS SOON AS WE SAW THEM COMING . COME ON , WE 'RE BACK . OPEN THE DOOR ! THAT 'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THOSE TWO . THEY ALWAYS KNOW WHEN TO DISOBEY AN ORDER . MARCUS , COME ON , WHY ARE YOU- - DO WE HAVE TO HOOK THE WINCH UP AND PULL THE MOTHERFUCKER OFF ? NOT A BAD IDEA . LOOK , YOU DON 'T THINK I PEEKED ? I KNOW WHERE I AM . NOW , YOU DON 'T WANT TO PISS ME OFF , 'CAUSE I WILL GO BACK AND I WILL TELL EVERYBODY WHERE YOU ARE . MARCUS , YOU CAN 'T LET THEM IN . LEE , I CAN 'T LEAVE THEM OUT THERE . BESIDES , IT 'S A GREAT WAY TO GET THE BALL ROLLING WHILE MAINTAINING DENIABILITY . NOW , STOP PLAYING AROUND . COME ON . MARCUS , THE COUNCIL , THE VOTE , YOU WILL LOSE . LEE , LEE , SOMETIMES WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF ON THIN ICE , ALL YOU CAN DO IS DANCE . THE DAMAGE IS DONE . THEY KNOW WHERE WE ARE . WE MAY AS WELL LET THEM IN . GIVE US A BREAK . HAVEN 'T WE BEEN THROUGH THIS BULLSHIT ALREADY ? ARE THEY ALWAYS THIS HAPPY TO SEE YOU ? NO , USUALLY WE GET MILK AND COOKIES . OH , SPEAKING OF ... I 'M HUNGRY . IS ANYONE ELSE HUNGRY ? THEO , YOU DON 'T SEEM TOO BOTHERED BY ALL THIS . NOW , WHY IS THAT ? WELL , I FIGURE IT 'S Y 'ALL THEY 'RE PISSED AT . SEE , I 'M THINKIN' ONCE THEY DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH YOU , THEN THE HEAD OF THIS ROCK IS GOING TO GIVE ME THE GRAND TOUR . REMEMBER , I WAS INVITED ! SO ANYTIME . HEY , ANYTIME NOW ! THEO IS READY TO GET THIS PARTY STARTED . DID YOU TALK TO THE OTHERS ? I DID . AND ? IT 'S STILL 50-50 . LOOK , IF WE GO TO A FULL VOTE RIGHT NOW , ODDS ARE WE LOSE ... OR DEADLOCK . HOW MUCH MORE EVIDENCE DO THE OTHERS NEED BEFORE THEY FIGURE OUT THAT MARCUS IS OUT OF CONTROL ? THOMAS IS RIGHT . WE GAVE MARCUS EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS . HE CHOSE TO IGNORE THEM . ANDREW , HE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED . SO WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND , ANDREW ? PERHAPS ... PERHAPS WE SHOULD USE MARCUS ' DECISION AGAINST HIM . WE ALL KNOW WHO AND WHAT THEO IS . LET 'S GIVE HER ALL THE FREEDOM SHE WANTS TO MOVE AROUND . SOONER OR LATER , SHE WILL GIVE US ALL THE PROOF WE NEED TO CONVINCE THE REST OF THE COUNCIL WHAT WE 'VE ALWAYS KNOWN , BUT HAD FORGOTTEN IN MARCUS ' MISSIONARY ZEAL . THAT IF WE LET THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN HERE , THEY WILL STEAL AND DESTROY EVERYTHING WE 'VE BUILT . I CONCUR . I 'LL TELL THE OTHERS . JESUS , ANDREW , WE NEED TO DO MORE , MAN , NOT TAKE OFF THE PRESSURE . NO , NO , NO . BE PATIENT , THOMAS . ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WATCH AND WAIT . AN OPPORTUNITY WILL PRESENT ITSELF . MAYBE . HEY . ELIZABETH . OH , I 'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU . WHAT , I DON 'T GET NO HUG OVER HERE ? WHAT 'S THE DEAL , MARCUS ? ERIN WILL FILL YOU IN ON EVERYTHING THAT 'S BEEN GOING ON . YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE 'VE BEEN THROUGH . YEAH , WHAT YOU 'VE BEEN THROUGH ... YOU , TOO , LEE . SO YOU 'RE MARCUS ? MARCUS ALEXANDER . PLEASED TO MEET YOU . CHARMED , I 'M SURE . SO , UH ... WHAT , YOU GOIN ' TO KEEP ME LOCKED IN HERE FOREVER ? NO , THAT 'S AN UNFORTUNATE RESULT OF CHANGES THAT ARE OCCURRING INTERNALLY . SORRY ABOUT THAT . OH , BELIEVE ME , I UNDERSTAND HOW QUICKLY THINGS CAN CHANGE . YES . CLAREFIELD . YOUR NOTE INTRIGUED ME . I 'D BE A FOOL NOT TO CHECK INTO IT , AND YOU 'LL SEE I AM NO FOOL . LET 'S CUT TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER . WE HAVE A COMMON ENEMY , ONE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF , BUT WE 'VE BEEN TRACKING THEM FOR SOME TIME NOW . WE THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME- - THIS IS THE LEGENDARY THEO . HMM . HOW LONG 'S SHE BEEN IN THERE ? JUST GOT HERE . THIS HER STUFF ? YEAH . JUST FINISHED GOING OVER IT . WE 'LL GIVE IT BACK TO HER WHEN MARCUS IS DONE . LISTEN , LEE , I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR IMPARTIALITY DURING THIS TIME . AND I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU WERE PLANNING ON VOTING TOMORROW . I HAVEN 'T DECIDED . WELL , I KNOW ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , YOU 'LL DO THE RIGHT THING . AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW , ANDREW SAYS THERE 'LL ALWAYS BE A PLACE FOR YOU AS HEAD OF SECURITY , NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW . KURDY AND I ARE GONE FROM THE MOUNTAIN FOR A FEW DAYS , WE COME BACK , AND THE MONKEYS ARE TAKING OVER THE ZOO . I KNOW . I SHOULD 'VE SEEN THIS COMING . ANDREW AND THOMAS CAME HERE 5 YEARS AGO . APPARENTLY , THEY HAD IT PRETTY ROUGH OUT THERE . IT ALMOST KILLED BOTH OF THEM . ANDREW WAS SO GRATEFUL WHEN HE FOUND THIS PLACE . HE GOT INVOLVED , GOT ON THE COUNCIL , GOT HIS BROTHER ON WITH HIM . SO WITH HIM , IT 'S PERSONAL , OR IS HE JUST TRYING TO BE THE BIG DOG HERE ? YES , BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU MIGHT THINK . I MEAN , I DON 'T THINK IT 'S ABOUT POWER . THEN WHAT ELSE IS THERE ? SAFETY . WHATEVER THEY WENT THROUGH OUT THERE MUST 'VE BEEN PRETTY BAD . ANDREW NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT , BUT I KNOW IT LEFT THOMAS PRETTY MESSED UP . FOR THE FIRST YEAR , HE WOULDN 'T EVEN TALK TO ANYBODY . HE 'D JUST DO WEIRD THINGS . WEIRD ? WHAT KIND OF WEIRD ? LIKE PLUCK THE WINGS OFF FLIES , WATCH ' EM SPIN AROUND FOR HOURS , STUFF LIKE THAT . WELL , WHERE I COME FROM , THAT 'S JUST A GOOD SATURDAY NIGHT . POINT IS , THIS PLACE IS THEIR SALVATION . IT 'S THEIR SAFE HAVEN . THE IDEA THAT MARCUS COULD JEOPARDIZE THAT , IT SCARES THEM . YEAH , SCARED PEOPLE ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE . THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE , KEEPING LOW AND HIDING OUT . AND IF THAT MEANS GETTING RID OF MARCUS ... DAMN , AND WE JUST GOT MARCUS BROKEN IN . YOU KNOW WHAT GETS ME ABOUT THIS COUNCIL ? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THEY 'VE BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE ? DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT 'S GOING ON AS THEY SIT IN HERE ALL NICE AND COZY ? YEAH , WELL , THEY 'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT . 'CAUSE ALL THAT STUFF OUTSIDE , IT 'S GOING TO COME KNOCKING AT THE FRONT DOOR PRETTY SOON . YOU GO THE WAY MARCUS GOES , AT LEAST YOU HAVE PEOPLE YOU CAN COUNT ON WHEN THE HAMMER FALLS . YOU GO THE OTHER WAY , YOU 'RE ALL ALONE . THAT 'S NOT PLAYING IT SAFE , THAT 'S TERMINAL . HEY , WHAT YOU LOOKIN ' AT ? MAN GAVE ME THE HAIRY EYEBALL . YOU SEE THAT ? I 'M SURE HE DIDN 'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT . UH ... WE JUST DON 'T GET GUESTS HERE VERY OFTEN . IF YOU TAKE A PICTURE , IT WILL LAST LONGER . YOU ENJOY THAT , DON 'T YOU ? OH , YES , IT 'S GOOD TO BE QUEEN . HUMPH . NOW , LOOK , MARCUS , BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER , I NEED TO KNOW ... DO YOU THINK YOU CAN , UH , TRUST ME ? NO . BUT WHEN EXTENDING THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP , YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE . YOU 'RE MESSED UP , YOU KNOW THAT ? YEAH , I GET THAT A LOT . SO I THOUGHT WE 'D GO SEE THE , UH , COMMUNICATIONS ROOM , UH , THE CAFETERIA , THERE 'S THE , UH , GARBAGE DISPOSAL . IS THAT- - THAT 'S THE REST ROOM , YEAH . AND THEN I THOUGHT WE 'D , UH , HEAD UP TO MY OFFICE , HOOK UP WITH ERIN AND- - THEO . THEO ? AH . THEO ! THEO , ARE YOU OK IN THERE ? FINE ! JUST FINE . WHAT ? NOTHING , NOTHING . WELL , COME ON ! LET 'S NOT KEEP DESTINY WAITING . THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM . GODDAMN , YOU GOT THE SETUP ! UH , YEAH , FROM HERE WE CAN STAY IN TOUCH WITH ALL OUR TEAMS , NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE , THROUGH A SERIES OF RELAYS . SO THOSE YOUR BRAIN BOYS ? WELL , I--I THINK WE THINK OF EVERYBODY HERE AS A ... AS A BRAIN BOY . UH-HUH . WELL , GIVE YOUR WOMEN MY CONDOLENCES . EXCUSE ME , MARCUS . CAN I , UH , CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND ? SURE . WI-WILL YOU EXCUSE ME ? NO PROBLEM . I GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD . LOOK , I , UH ... I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I 'M SORRY ABOUT HOW THINGS WENT DOWN WITH THE COUNCIL AND ALL . THAT 'S KIND OF YOU , CONSIDERING YOUR BROTHER IS THE CHAIRMAN . JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW BEFORE THE VOTE THAT , UH , I 'M BEHIND YOU . HEY ! HEY , WHAT 'RE YOU DOING ? YOU TALKIN ' TO ME ? YEAH , I 'M TALKING TO YOU . WHAT DID YOU JUST PUT IN YOUR FUCKING BAG ? I DIDN 'T PUT NOTHIN' IN NO FUCKING BAG . LOOK , WHAT IS THIS ? Y 'ALL TRYING TO SET ME UP ? THOMAS ! SHE GRABBED ONE OF THE WALKIES , MAN . I SAW HER . YOU FULL OF SHIT . GIVE ME THE BAG ! GIVE ME THE FUCKING BAG ! THOMAS ! THEO ! DAMN ! STOP . STOP ! NO . GET OFF ! STOP IT ! GET OFF OF ME ! MARCUS , I 'M GONNA HAVE TO GET YOU TO MOVE . WE HAVE TO GET HIM TO THE INFIRMARY , FAST . WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED ? THE SON OF A BITCH ATTACKED ME . THE-THERE WAS A PROBLEM . I DON 'T WANT TO HEAR IT , MARCUS . THIS IS YOUR FAULT FOR LETTING HER IN HERE . LEE , GET HER OUT OF HERE . LOCK HER UP ! MARCUS ? NO . LET GO OF ME ! THE SON OF A BITCH SET ME UP . THIS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR GUESTS , HUH ? IS IT , MARCUS ? JEREMIAH . THERE YOU ARE , FINALLY . WERE YOU EXPECTING ME ? NO , I ... WHY DO YOU ASK ? WHAT YOU DOING ? I 'M HAVING A DRINK . HMM . LOOKS TO ME LIKE MAYBE YOU 'RE DRUNK . I AM DRINKING , BUT I HAVE NOT DRUNK ENOUGH . HAVE ONE . SURE . WHAT ARE WE DRINKING TO ? WE ARE DRINKING BECAUSE ... BECAUSE , FOR THE FIRST TIME , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO . EVERYTHING THAT 'S , UH , GOING ON ISN 'T YOUR FAULT , MARCUS . OH , BULLSHIT . EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS HERE IS MY RESPONSIBILITY . MAYBE THE COUNCIL 'S RIGHT . IF I HADN 'T SECOND-GUESSED THEM , THEN NONE OF THIS WOULD 'VE HAPPENED . IT 'S BEEN 15 YEARS , JEREMIAH . IT 'S BEEN A GOOD RUN . MAYBE I- - I SHOULD STEP ASIDE . MAYBE . MAYBE IT 'S 2 SEPARATE ISSUES . SO ... YOU 'RE SAYING THEY 'RE RIGHT ? FOR 15 YEARS YOU KEPT THIS PLACE A SECRET , AND IT WORKED . PEOPLE ARE SAFE . NOW , YOU STAY INSIDE , YOU KEEP THE DOOR LOCKED , THEY WILL STAY SAFE ... FOR A WHILE . I 'D SAY ABOUT ANOTHER YEAR , TOPS . BUT THEY 'RE CHOOSING TO LOOK ANOTHER WAY . I MEAN , THEY REFUSE TO SEE THAT THE INEVITABLE IS GONNA HAPPEN . NOW , IF YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT STAYING INSIDE HERE , YEAH , THEY 'RE RIGHT . IF YOU 'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING OUT THERE , YOU ARE RIGHT . SO WE 'RE BOTH RIGHT . RIGHT . BUT I 'M RIGHTER THAN THEY ARE . WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULDN 'T HARBOR ALL THE GUILT OVER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED . THIS FROM SOMEONE WHO CARRIES THE GRIEF AND GUILT OF A LOST BROTHER AROUND LIKE A ... ALBATROSS . THAT , TOO . COME ON . WE 'VE GOT TO GET YOU SOBERED UP BEFORE THE COUNCIL MEETING . OH , YOU 'RE STARTING TO SOUND A LOT LIKE A CAMP COUNSELOR FROM CAMP NOT-A-LOTTA-FUN . IT 'S OK , I CAN WALK . I CAN WALK . OH , REALLY ? I CAN HANDLE WALKING . ALL RIGHT , THERE YOU GO . IT 'S THE SPINNING AND THE GRAVITY I 'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH . THAT 'S WHAT I THOUGHT . WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING ? UH , HAVING A PARTY . COME ON , GIVE ME A HAND . ERIN . WHERE ARE WE GOING ? GOT TO GET SOME COFFEE INTO YOUR FRIEND HERE . IS THIS WHAT I MISSED BY NOT GOING TO COLLEGE ? YEAH , IT 'S NOT MUCH TO WRITE HOME ABOUT . JEREMIAH , I AM HOME . HEY . HEY , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? ELIZABETH AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING , AND , UH , LOOK , YOU KNOW I 'M NOT A FAN OF THEO 'S . THIS I KNOW . THE WOMAN IS TROUBLE , END TO END , BUT SHE 'S NOT STUPID . NOW , SOMETHING ABOUT HER STEALING A WALKIE-TALKIE JUST DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? YOU--YOU THINK IT 'S BENEATH HER ? BENEATH THEO ? NOTHING 'S BENEATH THEO , BUT SHE 'S SMART . PEOPLE FORGET THAT . IF YOU HAD ONE CHANCE TO STEAL SOMETHING FROM THUNDER MOUNTAIN , WHY A WALKIE ? SO YOU COULD KEEP TABS ON THE OPERATION . ONLY THE BATTERIES 'LL GO DRY , AND ALL WE GOTTA DO IS CHANGE FREQUENCIES AND SHE 'S LOCKED OUT , BACK WHERE SHE STARTED . IF SHE WAS GOING TO STEAL SOMETHING , IT 'D BE SOMETHING BIGGER , SOMETHING MORE USEFUL . I DON 'T KNOW , MAN , IT SEEMS LIKE A WALKIE IS WHAT SOMEBODY IN HERE MIGHT THINK SHE 'D STEAL . SHE SAID SHE WAS SET UP , AND MAYBE SHE WAS . HOW 'S YOUR BROTHER ? HE 'S--HE 'S AWAKE , BUT THEY SAY , UH , THEY SAY HE 'S PARALYZED FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN . I 'M SORRY . YEAH , WELL , I 'M JUST ON MY WAY TO SEE HIM . THEY 'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN . THANKS . THAT 'S NICE , ISN 'T IT ? WHAT--WHAT ? THAT THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN . IT 'S , UH , IT 'S NOT LIKE IT WAS , LIKE IT IS , OUTSIDE OF HERE . YEAH , UH , I DON 'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW . YEAH , I HEARD YOU GUYS HAD SOME , UH , REALLY ROUGH TIMES OUT THERE , BUT , YOU KNOW , EVERYBODY HAD ROUGH TIMES OUT THERE . THE THING IS , YOU FOUND REFUGE HERE . BUT THAT 'S NOT THE IMPORTANT THING . THE IMPORTANT THING IS THEY LET YOU IN . THEY DIDN 'T HAVE TO DO THAT . THEY--THEY COULD 'VE LOOKED OUTSIDE , SAW THE TWO OF YOU THERE , AND THOUGHT , " NAH , IT 'S JUST TOO MUCH TROUBLE . LET 'S LOCK THE DOOR . " LIKE YOU WANT TO LOCK THE DOOR RIGHT NOW . LOOK- - YOU 'D BE DEAD . HE 'D BE DEAD . YEAH , HE 'S CRIPPLED . ISN 'T THAT BAD ENOUGH ? I DON 'T KNOW . YOU TELL ME . WHAT 'RE YOU GETTING AT ? MAYBE THEO DIDN 'T STEAL THE WALKIE-TALKIE . JESUS , YOU 'RE- - SOMEBODY COULD HAVE PLANTED IT . LOOK , I TALKED TO LEE CHEN . THOMAS WAS IN THE ROOM THE WHOLE TIME WITH HER PURSE . AND THEN LATER , HE--HE JUST COMES UP WITH IT , OUT OF NOWHERE . WHY WOULD HE DO THAT ? BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID . HE WANTED TO HELP YOU , AND THEN YOU WERE AFRAID . NO . I WON 'T LISTEN TO THIS . HI . HEY . HOW YOU FEELING ? I CAN 'T FEEL ANYTHING , ANDREW . THEY DON 'T THINK I 'LL WALK AGAIN . IT 'S A POSSIBILITY . THEY DON 'T KNOW FOR SURE . ONLY TIME WILL- - STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD . THOMAS . I--I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE WALKIE-TALKIE . TELL ME THAT IT WORKED AND THAT THIS WASN 'T ALL FOR NOTHING . I SHOWED ' EM YOU WERE RIGHT . THAT WOMAN 'S A FRICKIN ' MENACE . THEY ALL ARE . HOW DID IT GET INTO- - WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ? THOMAS ... NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I DON 'T REMEMBER THAT I OWE YOU MY LIFE . YOU LITERALLY CARRIED ME HERE THE LAST COUPLE OF MILES TO FIND THIS PLACE . I HEARD YOU BEG TO LET US IN . THE OTHERS , THEY DON 'T REMEMBER WHAT IT 'S LIKE OUT THERE , BUT I DO . YOU 'VE WORKED SO HARD TO GET HERE , AND I COULDN 'T LET SOMEONE SCREW THAT UP FOR YOU . THOMAS . DID YOU PLANT THE WALKIE-TALKIE IN THEO 'S BAG ? YES . WHY ? YOU 'RE MY BROTHER , AND I LOVE YOU . YOU CAN WIN THIS , ANDREW . JUST DON 'T BLOW IT . NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED , NOBODY . THE COUNCIL 'S BEHIND YOU NOW . ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY NOTHING , AND IT 'S ALL YOURS . WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY TO WEIGH A VERY SERIOUS QUESTION . THIS COUNCIL HAS BEEN KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT KEY DECISIONS MADE BY MARCUS , DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE WELL-BEING AND THE SAFETY OF EVERY PERSON HERE . WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED ONLY AT HIS CONVENIENCE AND DISCRETION . IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT A NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE HAS BEEN REQUESTED . THE LEADERSHIP OF THE THUNDER MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY WILL BE PASSED TO THE CHAIR OF THIS COUNCIL , UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT A PROPER ELECTION CAN BE HELD . BEFORE THE COUNCIL VOTES , DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY , MARCUS ? FOR 15 YEARS , I 'VE GIVEN THIS PLACE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE , AND EVERYTHING THAT I AM . ALONG THE WAY , FROM TIME TO TIME , I 'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES , BUT BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THUNDER MOUNTAIN ISN 'T ONE OF THEM . WE GO FORWARD , OR WE GO BACK . THE CHOICE IS YOURS . A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AGO , THOMAS TOLD ME THAT HE PLANTED THE WALKIE-TALKIE IN THEO 'S BAG . HE WANTED TO PROVE THAT PEOPLE COMING HERE FROM THE OUTSIDE CAN 'T BE TRUSTED . AND HE 'S RIGHT ... BUT WHAT WE SOMETIMES FORGET IS THAT HALF OF US CAME HERE FROM THE OUTSIDE . SO IF OUTSIDERS CAN 'T BE TRUSTED , THEN WE HAVE TO INCLUDE OURSELVES IN THAT CATEGORY . WHAT THOMAS DID PROVES TO ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE NEED SOMEONE WE CAN TRUST , EVEN WHEN HE DOESN 'T TRUST US AS WELL AS HE MIGHT OR SHOULD . ANDREW ... THOMAS DID WHAT HE DID OUT OF FEAR , AS DID I , I 'M ASHAMED TO SAY . THUNDER MOUNTAIN CAN NEVER BE WHAT IT WAS DESTINED TO BECOME , A BEACON STANDING ON A HILL FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE , IF THOSE WHO LEAD IT LIVE IN FEAR . I HAVE SOMETIMES QUESTIONED MARCUS 'S METHODS , BUT I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED HIS COURAGE . SO ... I HEREBY WITHDRAW MY REQUEST FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE AND RESIGN FROM THIS COUNCIL . ANDREW , YOU DON 'T HAVE TO DO THAT . THOMAS IS GONNA NEED ALL MY HELP IN THE COMING DAYS , WEEKS , AND YEARS . I PLAN ON BEING THERE FOR HIM . LOOKS LIKE THE BEST MAN WON . AND HE 'S JUST LEFT THE ROOM . DAMN IT ! THEO ? I 'M NOT FEELING YOU RIGHT NOW . MARCUS , I 'M NOT FEELING EITHER ONE OF YOU . THEO , I 'M SORRY . OH , THAT SOUNDED LIKE A LIE ROLLING OFF YOUR TONGUE . DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO BE SHOVED INTO A CLOSET LIKE AN OLD SHOE FOR SOMETHING YOU DIDN 'T DO ? YEAH , I THINK I HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE . HOW THE HELL DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS FUN HOUSE , ANYWAY ? HUH ? I DON 'T KNOW WHAT 'S WORSE , BEING LOCKED OUT OR BEING LOCKED IN . THEO , THE OTHER LEADERS HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED . THEY 'RE WAITING FOR US IN MY OFFICE . I THINK THEY WANT TO SEE IF YOU 'LL SHOW UP , BEFORE COMMITTING TO THE CONVERSATION . DID YOU REALLY TRAVEL ALL THIS WAY NOT TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING ? YOU NEVER STRUCK ME AS SOMEBODY WHO 'D RUN . THEO DOES NOT RUN , HONEY . I MIGHT WALK FAST , BUT THAT 'S JUST THE SHOES . YOU HEAR WHAT I 'M SAYIN ' ? THEO , WE 'LL DO WHAT WE CAN . I CAN 'T MAKE ANY PROMISES ABOUT PUTTING YOU BACK IN POWER IN CLAREFIELD , BUT IF WE 'RE SUCCESSFUL AT WHAT WE 'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE , I CAN GUARANTEE YOU A SEAT AT A BIGGER TABLE , A MUCH BIGGER TABLE . YOU KNOW WHEN I KNEW THIS WASN 'T GONNA WORK ? FROM THE MOMENT YOU INTRODUCED YOURSELF . YOU SAID YOUR NAME WAS MARCUS ALEXANDER . YOUR BUDDY 'S NAME IS LEE CHEN . I BET EVEN ERIN HAS A LAST NAME . I DON 'T- - EVERYBODY ON THE OUTSIDE JUST USES THEIR FIRST NAME , THAT 'S ALL . SO IT 'S THEO AND JEREMIAH AND KURDY AND SAM AND PHIL . BUT OUR LAST NAMES TIE US BACK TO FAMILIES AND HISTORIES THAT ENDED WITH THE BIG DEATH . OUR LAST NAMES DIED WITH THE OLD WORLD . IT DOESN 'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY . THERE 'S HOPE . SEE , THAT IS JUST THE THING . IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE THESE WALLS , HOPE CAN KILL YOU , AND I JUST DON 'T KNOW IF I 'M UP FOR THAT KIND OF PAIN . SO WHAT WAS YOUR LAST NAME , ANYWAY ? COLERIDGE . THEODORA ... COLERIDGE . THAT 'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME . THEO ... MS. COLERIDGE . STAY . PLEASE ?

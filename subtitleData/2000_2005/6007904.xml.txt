 previously on Farscape Every wormhole system has millions of exits ... each to a distinct time and place . Einstein , what the hell is goin on here ? Zhaan and Aeryn are out there under a flag of truce . Katratzi You will never get the wormhole tech from me . Scorpius is here ... looking for the key to what is inside my head . He will use you , and the baby ... We need a sensordistorter for our ship ... to fool long range scans . Gezzah ! A Scarran . If I 'm not back at the pod in half and arn , you go without me . - What ? Go . The Scarran warship is still in pursuit . What about the ... Baby ? What about the baby ? What ? Where 's Aeryn ? A bioloid . I don 't care about the things you care about . Peacekeepers rule the Scarrans . The Scarrans rule the Peacekeepers . I care about one thing . Help me get her , and I will give you wormholes . There was one ... guard . I don 't ... remember her face . She never ... told me her name . She told me a legend about ... how Sebaceans once had a god called ... Djancaz-bru . Six worlds prayed to her . They ... built her temples , conquered planets and yet , one day she still ... rose up and destroyed all six worlds . And when the last warrior was dying , he ... We gave you everything . Why did you destroy us ? And , she looked down upon him , and she whispered ... Because I can . - Aeryn could be dead . - The Scarrans will not kill her . They want to use her to find me . The Scarrans will mind-rape her until she has no allegiance to you . I 'll find her before then . She will not be able to resist for long . I know this ... Stop . I 'll find her . I just want to make you aware of the improbability of what you propose . You have a plan ? Yes , and don 't interrupt before I finish , no matter how stupid it sounds . John ... I said , do not interrupt . When I met Einstein , I blipped to bizarro Moya . Same Leviathan , but different . The Stark there uttered ... 'Katratzi ' . I thought it was gobbledy-gook . But then , Sikozu heard the same word when Aeryn was being kidnapped . I know that too . You think this ' Katratzi ' ... is the Scarran base they 'll be taking her . Right . But , you do not know where it is , do you ? No . You know that . Right again . So , I figure , if bizarro Stark knows the name of the base , he might know its location . That 's it . Best I got . You got any better ideas ? I listen . If I help with this insanity ... and we do get Aeryn back ... you will tell me all you know about wormholes ? Every equation . Every formula . Everything . What , are we in the mob ? Nosferontu . First instinct is always right . Scarran blood vow . You hate everything Scarran . Look , Djancaz-bru . I know I 'm not the sort of person who usually does this sort of thing , so I 'm not quite sure what I 'm supposed to be saying ... except that I really ... need your help . I need you to send me some sort of sign that he 's coming for me . Can you do that ? I 've given you time to consider . Are you ready to answer ? Yes . Stiinga-tuk . Wait , did I pronounce that correctly ? Let me try that again . Stiinga-took . That 's better . I gave you a chance ! Where is Crichton ? I don 't know ! I ... Stop resisting . Where is he ? He ... he 's on Moya . Six hundred telliks and rising . If you don 't stop , you 'll kill her . I 'm using no more force than usual . This won 't harm her . What do you know about Crichton 's wormhole research ? Six hundred and twenty . I don 't know anything . He didn 't tell me anything . Stop ! What 's the matter with this one ? Is she weak , or is she faking ? She 's not faking . Well , when she wakes , convince her to tell me all that she knows if she wants to live , or I will start again . You 're going to go to the variant Moya ? Yep . But you could end up on Earth again ... mess up everything . I got this hum in my head like a whale . A whale ? Whattza whale ? You know what a fish is ? Think big fish with sonar . John , I think you should have a rest first . D , I got a hum in my head . I 'm gonna follow it . Oh , you got somethin in there ... but it 's not a brain . Einstein said I can get back to the places I 've been to before . It 's like a homing beacon . I can make it . You can 't go with fek-face . He 'll screw you , then he 'll betray you . So little trust , Nebari . What 's going on ? Why 're you going with him ? John and I have an agreement . What agreement ? The details are confidential . John ... don 't . Guys , I know what I 'm doing is stupid , but it 's out of my hands . I got to save Aeryn ... Just get us close to the wormhole . If we don 't come back ... Right . Feeling better ? Critical heat delirium . I almost couldn 't get your temperature down in time . I thought Peacekeepers were supposed to be battle strengthened . Why did his heat probe almost kill you ? I ... I 'm tired . Just go away . Wish I could . Listen , that fenik will kill you unless you give him a reason not to . I 've seen it happen . You 'll be just another D.I.T ... All right . Don 't listen . I 'm just trying to save your life . Are you really Sebacean ? Yes . Does it make it easier ... to make the others do your dirty work and you take the coward 's choice ? Listen . I 've heard all that dren before . Usually from people like you ... chained to a cell . Look at me ... I 'm not . You know why ? Because I figured out a long time ago ... Peacekeepers , Scarrans ... what difference does it matter who rules ? It won 't be me . All I 'm going to do is survive . I suggest ... you should do the same . I 'll tell Captain Jenek you 're ready for another interrogation . Pilot , thank Moya for us and stay well clear . You guys have come far enough . Crichton ! Moya 's senses indicate the wormhole is destabilizing . Yah , it 's not too good . Grasshopper , you still up for this ? I was just musing . If you miss your intended target we could change the future . Or the past . Create a world devoid of Peacekeepers ... and Scarrans . Would you like that , John ? Clear the mechanism . Focus . Guys ... we 'll see you around . Good luck , Crichton ... and come back . Left ... and left again . No ... damn , right ! - I thought you knew where you were going . - Shut up , Grasshopper . I 'm trying to concentrate . Left Up there . That should be it . And ... we are were Where exactly is here ? The signal from her bioloid stopped before our Dreadnaught could locate their Leviathan . How did they detect it so quickly ? That is the first question I will ask the Sebacean . Captain , there is something ... about her . Her reaction to your heat probe was so severe ... Nurse , you seem confused . I don 't care if she dies . Her usefully is most likely already completed . I know but ... give me an arn . I have an idea how she still might be useful to us . One arn ... then she answers or dies . Something to make you sleep . I don 't need any help . Orders . No , I don 't want it . Stay away from me . Get away from me and don 't touch ... It 'll only be more painful if you fight . Get it out of me ! Wait a minute ... you 're not giving me something . You 're taking . What ... are you doing ? What have you done ? Some kind of crap has frozen up in the fluid drives . We 're not goin anywhere unless I can ... flip that switch again . Ironic , wouldn 't it be ... if we were to die here together ? Yah , we 're a regular Romeo and Juliet . Damn this ... spinning makes me feel like I 'm drinkin Mezcal . You got somethin like Mezcal ? Drink the drink , eat the worm ? I can see you eatin a whole plateful of worms . Maybe not . Just for the record ... if you 'd gotten the information and were able to control wormholes , what would you have done with it ? Taken over as much of the Universe as possible ... found your home planet and destroyed it . That 's not funny . No , I would use the wormholes ... as a deterrent against any future Scarran attack . Alright , strap yourself in . We could be in for a little jolt . That stuff should be melted by now . Oh , come on , baby . This should work . Left ... again . Gotta go . Is that the Moya we 're looking for ? Better be ... my head 's ringing like a fire-bell . How did you know we planned to kidnap Grayza ? Again ! How did you know ? Accident . Captain Jenek , stop . The Sebacean is dissembling . She will ... No ! I know why she 's reacting like this . Stop ! Do not interfere . She is with child . Scarran heat probe will kill a pregnant Sebacean . With child ? Well , she was ... close to Crichton , was she not ? Yes . I couldn 't have stopped him . You should have . Aeryn is dead . I know Scarrans . She is dead by now . We are not leaving . Grayza knows the location of this wormhole . D 'Argo ! She put the Skreeth on Moya when we were last here . Please ... Listen to her , Captain ... she 's right . Grayza knows Crichton used this wormhole as a path to get back to Earth . She knows he 'll come back here . And I thought you were finally convinced Crichton 's wormholes would get you home . We 're staying another arn . Pilot ! Get Moya to do a long-point , all range scan . I don 't care if it 's a gas cloud or an asteroid field , I want to know the microt she senses something . Setting scans now . Can you retrieve incumbent knowledge from fetal DNA ? Not here , but the med labs on Katratzi might be able to . What have you done ? What did you say to him ? I 've saved your life . You realize what this could mean ? If this is Crichton 's child , we could learn all he knows about wormholes from this fetal DNA . Yes . Get me out of here . Get me the frell out ! Get me out ! Djancaz-bru ... I 'm going to say this again because I don 't think you heard me last time . Just get a message to him . Let him know where I am so he can find me . I didn 't think Peacekeepers had gods . I thought they believed in the Warrior Code - and all that dren . Is there a Peacekeeper here ? Can she help us ? She can 't even help herself . She 's praying . Whose child is it ? Captain Jenek will force it from you . He believes that if he can find the human 's child , the Scarrans will reward him . Right now , he 's dreaming of palaces and virgins . - I 'm very happy for him . - I warn you ... he won 't kill you . But unless you tell him what he wants , he 'll make you wish you were dead . I have dozens of embryos inside me . I recreated with so many people . No . Just one . Whose is it ? No , really . , that 's what they used to call me . Talk to the other women here . They 'll tell you . We can keep you drugged and asleep . Or , we can make things ... hard and ugly ... worse than you can imagine . Every wormhole has millions of exits to different times and places which are complete and unending . So in this reality everyone on Moya has become someone they weren 't before ? Like they went ... into a blender . Why ? With these wormholes , anything is possible . Somewhere the Cubs are winning the World Series . Don 't ask . Did you feel that ? Better hurry . We got an arn before Crais overruns this place and slaughters everybody . Stark ? Rygel ? It 's a weird Universe . I didn 't invent it . Genetic incubation . They find something interesting about us ... see if they can produce an offspring they can use . They 've bred me six times . Three of them died before term . Three of them ... I don 't know where they are . So , what 's interesting about you ? The organic food on my planet grows a metal skin . I can dissolve it with saliva . Why don 't you spit on these and get us out of here ? Can 't do that . Only thin metal . Right . Well , that 's why they 're breeding me . To see if the little gnink in here can destroy weapons grade metal . And you just happen to be awake right now to talk to me ? No . I palm the dren they give me to sleep . I 've saved up enough so I can kill myself whenever I want . You don 't believe a word I 'm saying . You think I 'm working for that bitch nurse . They don 't need me to control you . You can 't beat them . They travel us around on frelled-up freighters like this and no one ever knows exactly where we are . No one can save us and we can 't escape . I know . I 've tried for cycles . Then I gave up . But I see ... you still think someone 's coming . You should talk to me . In here , talk 's all you 've got . I heard you say it ... Katratzi ! I don 't know , Crichton ! She did ! She said it ! She said it when Chiana was killed . Chiana 's dead ? No , no , no , no . Chiana 's not dead . Would you like me to take over the interrogation ? Stark ! Does Zhaan know ... Shut up ! I heard you say a Scarran word . Katra ... Katratzi . Katratzee . I think it 's a military base . Do you know the location ? Military base ? No . You said it when you were crossing someone over ... when you were in that trance state ... No . I never have any recollections when I 'm in the stykera state . But how could you speak in the Scarran tongue . Once I ... I must have crossed over a Scarran . They tell me things . And now you have no memory of it . No . Only when I 'm in the trance does the knowledge come flooding back to me . Where are you going ? Keep him here . I 'll be right back . It is a remarkable reproductive structure . Watch . The Sebacean egg is fertilized . It splits with life . It splits again , then stops . How does that happen ? The ovum secretes a fluid that keeps the pregnancy in stasis . Literally freezes the explosion of life . She can store this proto-fetus for up to seven cycles before triggering gestation . And that won 't hurt the embryo ? No . This will just pry the truth out of her . No , don 't use that . I won 't lie to you . I 'll just tell you what you want to know . You wouldn 't lie to me ? Yes , of course I 'd lie to you , you stupid bitch . Aeryn ... whose child is inside you ? Yours . Whose child ? I don 't know . Is it John Crichton 's ? I ... Is it his ? I don 't kn ... know . I don 't ... there was another man . Another ? Velorek . This Velorek ... where is he now ? He 's ... he 's dead . How did he die ? What charge ? High Command executed him for treason because ... I betrayed him . The man who conceived your child ? I reported him . She 's lying ! The serum isn 't working ! give her more . I 'm not lying . I 'm just not a very nice ... This Velorek . Is he the father of your child ? No . Wake up . Wake ... up ! - Wake her up . - I can 't . Not until some of the serum wears off . Are you working for her ? No . Of course not . Your mind seems uncompromised . What about hers ? How is her embryo coming along ? I 'm afraid her initial DNA scan shows no enhanced ability to the embryo . Then I will kill it . No . It 's too early . No ! It 's too early . Your tests can 't be accurate . They 're accurate . And I will watch it die . No ! No ! It 's too early ! No ! Unless I get answers that please me ... you will be next . Let go of me ! Who are you ? Crichton ... what is happening ? Dominar ... quiet . Crichton , who is this tralk ? Now ... You can channel past journeys when you cross a soul over ? Yes . What 're you doing ? - Now cross her over . - You cannot just shoot people ! They 'll be dead in an arn . You said so yourself . We have no time to negotiate , now ... cross her ... over ! No ! I can 't ! I can 't ! I can 't ! Why not ? ! Because I have to love the soul ! I have to care about where it goes to cross it over ! What do you mean , love the soul ? You never had to love the soul before . I 've always had to love the soul . Different Stark ... different rules . So , what happens if you don 't love the soul ? You won 't cross it over ? No . It 's not a question of . I can 't . When they die they ... they just go . Nothing happens . Whoops . Are you in pain ? What do you care ? I 'm just a Scarran spy and you 're a Peacekeeper . No , I 'm not a Peacekeeper . That 's the third one they 've terminated . I saw it on the scan . It must have been malformed or ... The three that survived ... they were beautiful . Healthy . And you 've had six ... pregnancies ? They 'll wait awhile ... then they 'll fertilize me again ... unless I 've got the guts to ... Have you ever had a child ? No . Never ? Well , soldiers seldom do , unless they 're placed on a breeding roster . In any case , it 's not the same as being a mother , is it ? That 's why I vowed I 'd never have one that way . And now ? And now , protecting this child will probably end my life . There is another way . To make sure they never get it . I 've hoarded enough sleep pills for the both of us . But I 've never been brave enough to end it myself . Coward . What 's your name ? Morrock . Well Morrock , when someone comes to get me , they can save you too . - Who does Stark love ? - You cannot just shoot people ! I find your priorities odd . We are in a hurry and these deformities are preordained to die soon ... who does Stark love ? ! Just because you do not have the resolution ... I got more than enough resolution the last time I was here and sometimes , Scorpy I do not like the way you do things ! I 've been comming them every thirty microts . Will his module even be able to make a reentry through that ? I don 't know . Moya 's scans indicate the wormhole 's stability has decreased another twelve percent . - D 'Argo , you know what we should do . - Stop hammering me . Grayza is no fool . We will die if we stay here much longer . I 'm not leaving Crichton ! We 're giving him another chance . How much longer ? Look , I don 't know ! Back ... off ... psycho No , we should vote . We wake up Noranti and the six of us vote . Because Crichton is safe ! But we will die if Grayza finds us here ! Majority rules . Not yet it doesn 't . I 'm the Captain . I 'm not willing to make that decision . I 'm afraid you might have to . What 's the matter , Pilot ? Moya 's long range scan has just picked up another vessel heading this way . Is it military ? I can 't tell yet . Any match on the embryo DNA ? Nothing . It 's a pattern the memory banks have never catalogued so it could be half human . We have no sample of Crichton 's DNA . If I tell you ? Your pain will end . When I was off Moya , I had another job . Assassinations , subversion . Whatever I was ordered to do . There was a man named Lechna . He was my contact ... found me all my assignments . But he was also my lover and I have tried to suppress it until now to protect him ... but I don 't want the drugs anymore . It is most likely his conception . This man ... what world is he from ? He 's from a place called Vendrall . It 's a small planet off most charts . Have you heard of it ? Yes . It 's in the Callus Nebula . That 's a long way from here . Perhaps that 's why the DNA isn 't in our database . I might cross-check the genetic similarities from the same Nebula . We 're gonna do this my way with Stark ... not yours ! - You haven 't got the resolution to do what 's necessary . - You can stop already with the resolution . Crichton ! What are you doing with Chiana ? That is Jool . Jool , just let us pass . What are you doing with Pip ? Shoot him ! Technically , it 's a she . Shoot it ! Let me handle this . Where are you taking Chiana ? Jool , let us pass . Stay back ! Shoot it ! Damn it , Jool ! Are you satisfied ? No . I don 't like the way you do things either . Very messy . - No , don 't ! - You lied ! We found record of Vendrall DNA . Your embryo is not the product of one of Vendrall 's sons . Well , Lechna lied to me ! There is no Lechna . There is Lechna ! - Leave her alone ! - Give her more ! I 've doubled the strength . No , please ! Again ! Stop it ! She 's telling the truth ! Again ! No , please don 't ! You 'll kill the child ! Is John Crichton the father of your child ? I 've already told you . It 's Lechna 's . Not Crichton 's . How many times do I have to tell you ? I knew Lechna before I went onto Moya . I was on Moya to watch Crichton . And , as soon as I left , I went straight back to Lechna . I have never ... ever loved John Crichton . I 've never loved him . You lie . Tell the truth . When I ... Yes ? When I left Moya ... terminal soldiers ... Lechna ... I forgot all about Crichton . It was ... I completely forgot about Crichton . I forgot all about him . D 'Argo . It 's a long way off , but the vessel approaching seems to be a Command Carrier . We 've done all Crichton could ask of us . We 've stayed here too long . We must starburst now . no . What if ... what if we initiate the engine signature change that I bought off Rekka ? Like we did before . Are you fahrbot ? Turn Moya into a Scarran freighter ? Peacekeepers are approaching . They 'll attack anything Scarran . We won 't let them get that close . Look , if they long-range scan us , they 'll move off , because we 're not Moya . It 's worth a shot . I need a decision , Captain . In thirty microts we 'll be in scanning range of the Command Carrier . Okay , you wanted a vote . Do we starburst or do we initiate engine signature change ? Starburst . Starburst . Stay . Pilot ? Moya and I say ... stay . Okay , we 're staying . Inititate the signature change . Given these differences , are you sure this will work ? It 's what happened before . Pip got killed . Stark channeled the Scarran while he was crossing her over . You or me ? I 'll do it . Hey , Crichton . Untie me . You know ... I know I ... always tie up people I like . If you kill her , I ... I won 't help you . I won 't cross her over . Yes you will . What is he talking about ? Look ... I know this doesn 't make any sense ... but you 're gonna die in half an arn and there 's nothing I can do to stop that . What ? What do you mean ? I 'm not gonna die . Yes , you are . Listen , Crichton . Are you in some kind of trouble ? Who is this fek ? Is he making you do this ? If you untie me , I can help you . I always do . It is not Aeryn . Looks a lot like her . Okay ... the joke 's over . Okay ? I , .. I was stupid to take it this seriously ... cause it 's a joke . Right ? You ha ... you have to stop because ... because you can 't kill me . You ... you can 't . No I can 't . I can . Now cross her over . Well , I don 't know if it 's Crichton 's ... child . The frell with your drugs . They 're not working . No . You 'll kill her ! Who is the father ? On Vendrall I met a ... a man ... There is no Lechna ... I made him up . Just Crichton ... Only , ever ... Crichton . Just him . Todye awkhel nervrusk . Kine ausamagaah , ausamagaa . Hasn 't she said it yet ? Be quiet . I can 't hear . Ausimaa kilay ti partreee . Kilay ti partree katratzee . Katratzi . That 's it , Stark . That 's the name of the base . Katratzi . Where is it ? Seat of Scarran power . Small . It 's fortified . Diguises its presence ... by mirroring the orbit of one of the moons of Trilask . Trilask ... Trilask katratzee ... Yes ... I know that planet . John ... we can go . Peacekeeper , wake up . How did you ... ? I watched the sequence codes . Are you sure ? The same time , then . Thank you . What for ? For doing this with me . I don 't want to be their test stallik . No ... no . Neither do I. Anyway ... what other choice do I have ? But your child . Aren 't you afraid ? I 'd rather be dead than let them have it . Is it really his ? The man you loved ? Does this really make you tired ? At first , but then ... You know , I had such ... incredible dreams for my child . It 's impossible not to . How she was going to change the world . How she was going to look after me when I was old . They were foolish . Not so foolish . I had the same dreams . Is it his ? Is it Crichton 's child ? Come here . Did you really have a child ? I told you , I ... had six pregnancies . Only three of them survived . I want the truth from you . I know that these pills won 't kill me . I know ... that you 're their spy . So I want to know the truth . Have you even had one child ? Have you even given birth to one child ? The truth . No . Then I orphan no one . We 're back . Open the hangar doors . And we know where that Scarran base is . No time , John . There 's a Command Carrier on the way . We 've got you in the docking web and we 're about to starburst . Got it . Okay , we 'll go as slow as we can , but you better buckle down in there . Starting starburst countdown grid . Why is nothing ever easy with you ? I wish I knew . Hold on , John . Pilot . Starburst now . We 've set a course for Katratzi . They 've been informed of your condition and there is a surgeon on hand . Now Djancaz-bru you haven 't listened and you haven 't helped . And , I 'm running out of time . So I 'm gonna forget about you . I am now willing to make a deal with anyone . With anything to save my child . Not because I can but because I have to .

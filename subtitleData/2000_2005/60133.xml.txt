 This is Mr Mathison . He 's a doctor . - Are you okay ? - An ambulance is on the way . Thankyou . Is there a name yet ? Elijah . Is he supposed to be crying like this ? May I ? Can I have him back ? What happened during the delivery ? Nothing . It was very quick . The babyjust wanted to come right out . And there were no problems . Did you drop him ? What ? Did you drop this baby ? Jesus Christ , no . Inform the ambulance that we have a situation . All right . Molly . I 've never seen this . It appears that your baby has sustained some fractures ... while inside your uterus . His arms and his legs are broken . This is Eastrail 177 . Nextstop , Philadelphia . Are you alone ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Someone left this magazine . Want to take a look at it ? Could I take a look at that one ? Thanks . - You like sports ? - It 's my fiîeld . I represent athletes . I 'm an agent . Are you looking for any male synchronized swimmers ? - I 'm thinking about getting into that . - Is that right ? I 'm afraid ofwater . Think that 's a problem ? You represent someone in Philadelphia ? I 'm meeting this player from Temple University . He 's a cornerback . This kid is 6 ' 1 " , 2 1 0 pounds . He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds . He 's gonna be a god . Do you like football ? Not really . - I 'm David Dunn . - Kelly . - Hi . - Hi , nice to meet you . Nice-Nice to meet you . How long are you gonna be in Philadelphia ? - I 'm married . - Great . - I 'm sorry . - What are you talking about ? I- - I thinkyou misunderstood what I was , uh ... - s-saying- - - I know . I think I 'm gonna fiînd another seat . I-l didn 't mean , uh- - That 's what he failedto realize . Ilook classy , not trashy . Ilook classytoo . What about me ? Don 't llook classy ? But I 'm afraidyou forgot this ! - Andthis ! And- - - Where hasyou been , Banana ? Nowl 'vegotyou , weasel . Some carsarestillon fire , andthe debris is everywhere . We are notsure at this time , uh ... howrescuepersonnel willbe able toget on scene at all . Ifyou 'rejust tuning in , Eastrailtrain number 177 ... hasderailed just outside Philadelphia . And we 're bringingyou live coverage from Skycam 4 . Yes , that is- - It appears to be a rescue ambulance ... andthere are more behindit lcan see on the access road . Idon 't knowhowclose they 're gonna be able toget , David . These are woodsand , uh , trees . It 'sgonna be a very difficult rescue effort . Try to hack some ofthat off . Hi . I 'm Dr Dubin . You 're in the emergency room in the Philadelphia City Hospital . You were in a serious accident . Look at me . How are you feeling ? - Okay . - Good . I 'm gonna askyou some questions . Have you ever had any heart or asthma problems in the past ? - No . - Kidney or renal problems ? - No . - Any allergies ? No . Where were you sitting on the train ? - Against the window . - In the passenger car ? Yeah . - Where are the other passengers ? - Was your family travelling with you ? No . Did you get up from your seat ? Are you certain you were in the passenger car ? Yes . Why are you looking at me like that ? Your train derailed . Some kind of malfunction . They only found two people alive so far- - you and this man . His skull was cracked open and most of his left side was crushed . And to answeryour question , there are two reasons ... why I 'm looking at you like this . One , because it seems in a few minutes ... that you will offiîcially be the only survivor ofthis train wreck . And two ... because you didn 't break one bone . You don 't have a scratch on you . David ? What happened in New York ? I don 't think I got thejob . I 'm still going to , uh- - I 'm still moving there . Just- - Uh , just-just not now . Good night . Good night . Sara Elaston ... social worker at Broad and Locust Community Centre . We pray foryour soul . Kevin Elliot , businessman ... father ofsix . We pray foryour soul . Glen Stevens ... researcher in the area of leukemia ... at Drexel University . We pray foryour soul . Jennifer Pennyman ... third-grade teacher atJefferson Elementary . We pray foryour soul . - Yes ? - Is Noel in , ma 'am ? No , sir , he is not . I read about you in the paper . - What ? - I was in an accident once too . A horse almost trampled me to death . - Wow . - Had him put down . That 's a sad story . Could- - Could you ask Noel something for me , please ? Proceed . Would you ask him to check how many sick days I 've taken ... since I 've worked here ? - That the entire message ? - Yes , ma 'am . Thankyou . Hey , Noel . What , you hit your head on that train ? Get your brain to start working again ? - What ? - Forty dollars . - Forty dollars what ? - You 're gettin ' a $ 40-a-week raise . That 's it . I checked . You were right . You 've never taken a sick day . Five years , no sick day . I get it . You want a raise . Smart way to make your point . - IsJoseph okay ? - Yeah . - He 's asleep . - Oh . I wanted to askyou a question . It 's gonna sound a little strange , but , uh ... just think about it for a second , okay ? Okay . When 's the last time I was sick ? Do you remember ? Um , l-l don 't know . It 's been a while . I haven 't been sick this year , I know that . Okay . Do you remember me gettin ' sick ? Um ... not a specifiîc day . And what 's-what 's this about ? Audrey , do you remember me ever getting sick ? In the three years we lived in this house ? In the old apartment ? BeforeJoseph was born ? Before we ever got married ? I-l can 't remember . Don 't you think that 's kind ofweird ... not remembering one cold or a-a fever or a sore throat ? What do you think it means ? Um ... I think it means I 'm probably too tired to remember . No more sittin ' in this room . I let it go on long enough . I 'm not goin ' out there any more . I 'm not getting hurt again . - This was the last time , I told you . - You can 't do anything about that . You might fall between this chair and that television . Ifthat 's what God has planned foryou , that 's what 's gonna happen . You can 't hide from it sittin ' in a room . They call me Mr Glass at school because I break like glass . You make this decision now ... to be afraid ... and you will never turn back . Your whole life , you will always be afraid . - I got a present foryou . - Why ? Forget why . You want it or not ? Well , go get it , then . Where is it ? On a bench ... across the street . Someone 's gonna take it . Then you better get out there soon . I bought a whole bunch . There 'll be one ofthese waitin ' foryou ... every time you want to come out here . They say this one has a surprise ending . This is from Fritz Campion 's own library . This is before the fiîrst issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1 968 . It 's a classic depiction of good versus evil . Notice the squarejaw ofSlayer , common in most comic heroes . And the slightly disproportionate size ofJaguaro 's head to his body . This again is common , but only in villains . The thing to notice about this piece ... the thing that makes it very , very special ... is its realistic depiction of its fiîgures . When the characters reached the magazine ... they were exaggerated ... as always happens . This is vintage . Well ... wrap it up . You 've made a considerably wise decision . Well , my kid 's gonna go berserk . Once again , please ? My sonJeb- - it 's a gift for him . - How old isJeb ? - He 's four . No . No , no , no , no , no . You need to go . Now . What 'd-What 'd I say ? Do you see any Teletubbies in here ? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt ... with my name printed on it ? Did you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside ... in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it ? No ? Well , that 's what you see at a toy store ... and you must think you 're in a toy store because ... you 're here shopping for an infant named Jeb . Now , one of us has made a gross error ... and wasted the other person 's valuable time . This is an art gallery , my friend ... and this is a piece ofart . We 're by appointment only . - I got a card from this store . - Congratulations . You have a mailbox . The exhibition isn 't for two weeks . This one was under the windshield wiper of my car . How certain are you that you 've never taken ill ? Seventy-fiîve percent . Well , that 's not certain at all , is it ? That 's hole number one . I 'm going to be extremely skeptical about all this . About all what ? I 'm assuming you 've never been injured . Would I be wrong in that assumption ? Dad 's been injured . Is the child correct ? Yes , sir . In college , I was in a car accident . - Was it serious ? - He couldn 't play football any more . That 's hole number two . That 's a big one . Mr Price , can we talk about the note that you left on my car ? I 've studied the form ofcomics intimately . I 've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed ... with nothing else to do but read . I believe comics are our last link ... to an ancient way of passing on history . The Egyptians drew on walls . Countries all over the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms . I believe comics are a form of history ... that someone somewhere felt or experienced . Then , ofcourse , those experiences and that history ... got chewed up in the commercial machine , gotjazzed up ... made titillating , cartooned for the sale rack . This city has seen its share ofdisasters . I watched the aftermath ofthat plane crash . I watched the carnage ofthe hotel fiîre . I watched the news waiting to hear a very specifiîc combination ofwords ... but they never came . Then one day I saw a news story about a train accident ... and I heard them . " There is a sole survivor ... and he is miraculously unharmed . " I have something called osteogenesis imperfecta . It 's a genetic disorder . I don 't make a particular protein very well ... and it makes my bones very low in density . Very easy to break . I 've had 54 breaks in my life ... and I have the tamest version ofthis disorder , type one . There are type two , type three , type four . Type fours don 't last very long . So that 's how it popped into my head . Ifthere is someone like me in the world ... and I 'm at one end ofthe spectrum ... couldn 't there be someone else ... the opposite of me at the other end ? Someone who doesn 't get sick , who doesn 't get hurt like the rest of us ? And he probably doesn 't even know it . The kind of person these stories are about . A person put here to protect the rest of us . To guard us . - You think my dad 's a real- - - I don 't think anything right now . It 's a possibility- - one with many holes . Joseph , don 't take another sip ofthat water . - Go throw it in the trash . - But Dad- - Do it now , please . I see guys like you all the time in my work . You fiînd someone you want to take advantage of ... you tell them a fantastic story ... and somewhere in there you say it : " I just need your credit card number ... a small down payment . " This morning was the fiîrst morning that I could remember ... that I didn 't open my eyes and feel ... sadness . I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me . I 'm gonna leave now . Good luck with your exhibition . So , what kind ofjob do you have , David ? You said you 've met guys like me in your work . - What exactly is it that you do ? - I work at the University Stadium . I 'm a security guard . Hi . I 've come to a decision . Okay . I just wanna askyou something , okay ? And you can be totally honest . I 'm prepared for any answer , and-and it won 't affect me . Have you been with anyone ? I mean , since we 've been having problems . The answer won 't affect me . I just need to know , you know ? I mean , it won 't affect me either way . No . Sorry , David . I 'm sorry . Anyway ... my decision is ... that I want to start again . And I want it to be like it was in the beginning . And it 's a big deal that you walked away from that train . I feel like it 's a second chance . And ifyou feel like asking me out sometime ... that 'd be okay . Okay . - Dunn . - Go for Dunn . Yeah , it 'sJenkins . Look , wegot aguy overatgate 17-C with a bogus ticket . Sayshe knowsyou . He won 't tellme hisname . What 's he look like ? Why is it , do you think , that ofall the professions in the world ... you chose protection ? - You are a very strange man . - You could have been a tax accountant . You could have owned your own gym . You could 've opened a chain of restaurants . You could 've done one of 1 0,000 things . But in the end , you chose to protect people . You made that decision , and I fiînd that ... very , very interesting . Now all I need is your credit card number . That last part was a joke . - You 're a big sports fan , are you ? - It 's starting to intrigue me . It gets heaviest ten minutes before kickoff . Programme here . Programme . Programme . Programme . Programme here . - Rich , why don 't we pat down ? - Right . - Just give me a minute . - Is there a problem ? I 'm sorry . I 'm gonna have to search you . - It 's nothing personal . - The tall guy in the camouflagejacket . Sometimes people carry weapons in here , and they drink too much . Ifthe team 's not doing good , bad things can happen . We do pat-downs ofthe crowd to discourage people from carrying . If he 's carrying , he 'll step out of line . Yeah , step right up here . Okay . I got you a seat up in the yellow section . It 's in the nosebleeds , but at least you won 't get spit on . - All right . - How 'd you know that guy you bumped ... was carrying a weapon ? I don 't know . Maybe it was that camouflage armyjacket he was wearing . Those guys like to carry hunting knives and stuff for show . You thought he was carrying a knife ? - I thought he was carrying something , yeah . - But not a knife . I got a picture ofa silver gun with a black grip ... tucked in his pants . You know , like on TV . You have good instincts for things like that ? - Like what ? - Knowing when people have done something wrong ? - Yeah . - Have you ever tried to develop it ? - I don 't know what you 're asking me . - Your skill . Look , I gotta be down on the sidelines during the game . - You can get to your seat right down- - - Characters in comics ... are often attributed special powers- - invisibility , X-ray vision , things ofthat sort . Okay . - I don 't wanna play this game any more . - It 's an exaggeration ofthe truth . Maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . - But he might not have been carrying anything . - But he might have been carrying ... a silver gun with a black grip tucked in his pants . - Dunn . - I gotta go . Yeah , I know . I 'll be right down . - One last question . - What ? That car accident you were in . Was there anyone else involved ? Yeah . My wife , Audrey . She was in the car with me . Have a good life , Elijah . Next time , try to buy your tickets at an authorized sales location . - Dunn . - I 'm on my way . ... into the investigation oftrain 177 ... being conductedat the Eastrail holding warehouses . The citycouncilhas steppedupplans topassa bill ... requiringhigherstandards forinspection andmaintenance ... ofallrailtransportation forPhiladelphia ... andits outlying districts . Hold up a second ! I just want to askyou something . Dad ! Hey , Dad ! Dad ! Joseph , do you know how mad your mother would be if she knew you were playing football ? Are you gonna tell ? You wanna play last ofthe downs ? We got a big guy like you . You could play on opposite sides . He 's Potter 's cousin . He 's starting cornerback at Temple University . He 's going pro in the draft . They say he can run the 40 in 4.3 seconds . Yeah , I 've heard . You can beat him , Dad . - Let 's beat him . - I 'm gonna go in . Just play one set ofdowns . I told them you were great . - Why 'd you do that ? - Just one . I 'm gonna go in . I 've got some things to do . - What things ? - I 'm gonna work out . - I 'll help you . - No , l-l don 't need- - I can 't play , guys ! I 'm working out with my dad ! Go , go . Here we go ! Ready ? Hut ! You 're doing good . Right there ! Catch ! I 'vegot to run To keep from hiding Andl 'm bound To keep on riding Andl 'vegot one more silverdollar How much did you put on there ? You put too much . That 's 250 pounds . How much can you lift ? That 's the most I ever lifted . That could 've been dangerous , Joseph . Why don 't you go upstairs now and let me fiînish up , okay ? I 'll take it off . I 'll help you right . You thinkyou could have beaten up Bruce Lee ? No . I mean , ifyou knew karate . No . Well , what if he wasn 't allowed to kick , and you were really mad at him ? No , Joseph . How much did you take off ? I lied . You added ? How much is it ? 270 pounds . Let 's put more . Okay . Why don 't you move back a little just to be safe , okay ? More ? You should never do anything like this . You know that , right ? What do you do ifsomething bad happens ? Get Mom . Right . How much did you put on that time ? All of it . What else can we use ? How much is it ? How much is it , Dad ? About 350 pounds . Fracture ofthe fiîfth metacarpal ofthe right hand ... as well as multiple fractures of the sixth , seventh and eighth ribs . The worst ofthe injury , however , was sustained to the right leg ... in the form ofa spiral fracture . There were 1 4 breaks . It simply shattered . They call me Mr Glass . - Who does ? - Kids . Are you all right , Mr Price ? Shall I continue ? Pins were placed throughout the length ofthe leg . The use ofa wheelchair will be needed for a two-month period . The use ofcrutches will follow for 1 2 to 1 4 months . Hospital stay will range from fiîve to eight days ... followed by nine to twelve months of physical therapy . Prescribed medication for pain management will take the usual forms ... of morphine drip , percocet , darvocet . Your , uh , 1 0 : 00 is here . The hospital discharged him this morning . Thanks . Elijah , right ? We 're gonna prevent any substantial atrophy ofyour good leg with this ... and it works your quadriceps . How long have you been married ? - Twelve years . - How 'd you get together ? I 'm a little nervous being here . I ask too many questions when I 'm nervous . A car accident . Oh . And now you 're gonna have to tell me more . My husband was a star athlete in college ... and we were in an accident together . Our car flipped on an icy road and we were both injured , and he couldn 't play football any more . And ifthat hadn 't happened , we probably wouldn 't have been together . - How so ? - I think we should talk about your rehab . You don 't have to answer ifyou don 't want to . So , tell me more about the quad machine . It prevents atrophy by- - I couldn 't spend my life with someone who played football . It 's pretty much that simple . I mean , I don 't hate the game . I admire the amount ofskill it involves . And-And like everyone else , I was in awe ofthe way he played it . But football , in many ways , is the opposite ofwhat I do . You 're rewarded the more you punish your opponent . You know , it 's too much about violence , and I don 't want violence in my life . It 's not a thing many people can understand , but- - Anyway , fate stepped in with that car accident ... and took football out ofthe equation . And everyone lived happily ever after . Sort of . What part of David 's body was injured ? Who said my husband 's name was David ? Ladiesandgentlemen- - In the first half- - A 737 crashes on takeoff- - 1 72 die , no survivors . A hotel fiîre downtown- - 2 1 1 die , no survivors . An Eastrail train derails 7 1 / 2 miles outside the city- - 1 31 die ... one survivor . He is unharmed . I 've spoken with your husband about his survival . I suggested a rather unbelievable possibility . Since then , I 've come to believe that possibility ... however unbelievable ... is now more a probability . And what was it you suggested ? These are mediocre times , Mrs Dunn . People are starting to lose hope . It 's hard for many to believe ... there are extraordinary things inside themselves as well as others . I hope you can keep an open mind . Excuse me , sir ? Can you step out of line , please ? We 've been having some problems with people selling drugs here in the stadium . Would you mind if I checkyour pockets ? Raise your arms , please . Come on , raise them up . I just got here , man . Can I put my hands down now ? Can I go ? Yeah . Hope you fiînd them . - Yo , Dunn . - Yeah . Ijust came into the office . Yourkid washurt . - Where is he ? - Someplay rehearsalatschool . He wantsyou to come down there . Is that your dad ? I bet my dad could beat up your dad . No , he , uh , he insisted we call only you ... though we had some trouble tracking you down . I mean , you 're not on our list . Audrey handles this type ofstuff . Oh . What type ofstuff ? Joseph stuff . Do I need to put any smelly ointment on him or anything ? No , no , it 's more emotional damage . Not , uh- - Not to serious , physically . Nothing like when I sent you to the hospital . When was that ? My offiîce was on the other side ofthe building back then . You don 't remember me , do you ? - No , ma 'am . - I had red hair . Well , you were a little younger thanJoseph when it happened . Did you know that we changed the rules ofconduct ... around the pool because ofyou ? The kids still tell about it ... like it was some sort of ghost story . " Did you know there was a kid nearly drowned in that pool ? He lay on the bottom ofthe pool for fiîve minutes . And when they pulled him out , he was dead . " We let them tell it . It helps keep them safe . You still phobic ofwater ? It was Potter and another guy . They were messing with this Chinese girl in the dressing room . Y-You can 't let bad things happen to good people , right ? That 's your code , right ? That 's the hero 's code . I tried to make them stop ... but they kept pushing me down , and they wouldn 't let me get back up . I thought maybe ' cause you 're my dad ... I thought I might be like you . I 'm not like you . You are like me . We can both get hurt . - I 'm just an ordinary man . - No , you 're not . Why do you keep saying that ? Elijah Price came to visit me at the centre today . Jesus . He didn 't do anything . Hejust ... told me his theory . That 's sad when patients get like that . They lose reality . Joseph , what the hell are you doing ? Oh , my God . You don 't believe . I 'll show you . You can 't get hurt . That gun 's not loaded . He doesn 't know where I keep the bullets . In your Rookie ofthe Year trophy . Joseph , did you load the gun ? - You won 't get hurt . - Elijah was wrong . - When did he meet Elijah ? - He was with me when I met him . No one believes him . Joseph , listen to me . Sometimes when people get sick or hurt for a long time , like Elijah ... their mind gets hurt too , and they start to think things that aren 't true . He told me what he thought about your father . It isn 't true . I 'll show you . Do you remember the story about the- - about the boy that almost drowned in the pool ? That was me they were talking about . I almost died . That was me . - You 're lying . - I 'm not lying , okay ? I just didn 't remember it , that 's all . Joseph , you know your father was injured in college . You know that . You know all about that . Don 't do it . He 'll die , Joseph . - I 'll just shoot him once . - Joseph , listen to what your moth- - Don 't be scared . Joseph ... ifyou pull that trigger , I 'm going to leave . Do you understand ? I 'm going to go to New York . Y-Y-You 're right . Ifyou pull that trigger ... that bullet isjust gonna bounce off me , and I 'm not going to be hurt . But then I 'm going to go upstairs and I 'm gonna pack ... and I 'm going to leave for New York . - Why ? - Because I thought we werejust starting to be friends for real . And friends 'll listen to each other . They don 't- - And-And they don 't shoot each other , uh , uh , do they , Audrey ? N-No shooting friends , Joseph . Joseph ! You are about to be in big trouble ! Now , I am your father , and I am telling you ... to put that goddamn gun down right now ! One , two- - I followed the guy in the camouflagejacket . He had a silver gun with a black grip tucked in the back of his pants . Were you really injured in that car accident in college ? 'Cause I believe you faked it . I believe you took the opportunity ... to end your football career , no questions asked . And I thinkyou did it , ofall things , for a woman . I guess that makes sense . Football 's what , just ten years ? But love ? Hmm . Now , that 's forever . And that little bit ofsadness in the mornings you spoke of ? I think I know what that is . Perhaps you 're not doing what you 're supposed to be doing . Most guns have a black or silver handle . I had a 50-50 shot of getting the colour right . - That 's not what I witnessed . - Stop . Stop messing with my life , Elijah . My son almost shot me last night because he wanted to prove you were right . I never said you couldn 't be killed . - I never said that . - My wife was right . There have been three major disasters , and you were the only one unharmed . I have been sick . When I was a kid , I spent a week in the hospital getting better from pneumonia . I almost drowned . Two skinny little kids ... were fooling around in a pool dunking me and I swallowed some water . They didn 't know it , and it almost killed me . Heroes don 't get killed like that . Normal people do , right ? I don 't need to see you any more , okay ? Please stay away from my family . Shesaidlcouldtellstories that couldmakeyou cry What aboutyou Hey , man , it 's 20 after .

You 're gonna be sitting your ass in jail now . I 've been tired , I 've been tired I 've been tired I 've been tired , I 've been tired I 've been tired , I 've been tired - I 've been tired , I 've been tired - How much for this one ? I 've been tired - Rust ? - Yeah . As a colour , not as rust . You know , like rust-coloured paint or wood . - I didn 't know that . - Mm-hmm . Mine 's still brown . Okay , my turn . Favourite song ? " Soft and Wet " by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince . What ? We 're supposed to be honest . " Soft And Wet . " That 's very interesting . Okay , my turn . When was the fiîrst time ... the thought popped into your head we might not make it ? That 's not the game . It 's the fiîrst date . There aren 't any rules . - Don 't know for sure . - Think carefully . What about the game ? It 's over . I won . Look , maybe it wasn 't a specifiîc moment . - Maybe it was a time- - - I had a nightmare one night ... and I didn 't wake you up so you could tell me that it was okay . I think that was the fiîrst time . Does that count ? That counts . Do you knowingly keep me and Joseph at a distance ? Yes . Why ? I don 't know . I just don 't feel right , Audrey . Something 's ... just not right . Do you resent us , David ? Resent the life you have ? I mean , there were a lot ofother things you could 've done after college . These were your choices . You know , even if it meant we couldn 't have been together ... I never would 've wished that injury on you . What you could do physically ... was a gift . I never would 've wished it to go away . You know that , right ? You had two calls afterJoseph went to bed . One came through ... while I was on the other line , but I wasn 't talking too long . There was an emergency with my sister . She tried to do her own perm , and now she looks like she stuck her head- - Who called through ? Um , someone from New York ... uh , about a securityjob . They want to hire you . I didn 't know you guys were moving to New York . Thanks for telling me . We weren 't all gonna move . Oh . I let the answering machine pick up the other call . Great . Look , let 'sjust be honest here . We 'rejust at the beginning ... and I don 't expect you or I to change ... the course ofwhere our lives were headed ... because ofone date . And ifyou do go to New York , we can develop this . We 'll just be forced to take it slow . And in the end , I think that 's defiînitely better . I mean , this is our second time around , David . I didn 't expect us ... to get carried away . But I guess " congratulations " is the right thing to say . David , it 's Eliijah . It wasso obvious . It was this one issue that brought it backforme- - Century Comics 1 17 .

It 's all right to be afraid , David ... because this part won 't be like a comic book . Real life doesn 't fiît into little boxes that were drawn for it . There 's one in the fiîrst row . It 's- - It 's the second one . Yes . It 's the second one over . Go back to Africa ! Hey , what 's your name ? I thinkyou drank too much . Can I come in ? Who are you ? I like your house . Can I come in ? What is this ? No , you can 't come in . Are you sure ? What are- - What are you- - It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . I had a bad dream . It 's over now . I don 't know . I can 't believe you 'd think that . I 'm just asking you . I 'm making French toast . I 've been thinking about Elijah Price . If he shows up again , I think we should call the police , okay ? Okay ? Okay . You were right . This is one ofJohann Davis' earliest drawings . See the villain 's eyes ? They 're larger than the other characters ' . They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective on how they see the world- - just off normal . He doesn 't look scary . Mm-hmm . That 's what I said to my son . But he says there 's always two kinds . There 's the soldier villain who fiîghts the hero with his hands ... and then there 's the real threat- - the brilliant and evil archenemy ... who fiîghts the hero with his mind . Are you Elijah 's mother ? I am . I 'm helping him with the sale . Nice to meet you . I 'm David Dunn . He 's spoken ofyou . Says you 're becoming friends . We are . Looks like he 's doing good today . I 'm very proud of him . He 's come through a lot in his life- - a couple of bad spills I thought had broken him . Mm-hmm . They were bad ... but he made it . Yes , he did . He 's kind ofa miracle . Yes , he is . - I 'll tell him you 're here . - Thankyou . We 'll work something out . Always able to work something out . It has begun . Tell me something , David . When you woke up this morning , was it still there ? The sadness ? No . I think this is where we shake hands . - Look ! - Did you see it ? I worked in that building 25 years . I know all its secrets . Secrets ? Like ifthere ever was a fiîre on floors one , two or three ... everyone in that hotel would be burned alive . Passengers aren 't allowed in there . Do you know what the scariest thing is ? To not know your place in this world ... to not know why you 're here . That 's- - That 'sjust an awful feeling . What have you done ? I almost gave up hope . There were so many times I questioned myself . You killed all those people . But I found you . So many sacrifiîces ... just to fiînd you . Jesus Christ ! Now that we know who you are ... I know who I am . I 'm not a mistake . It all makes sense . In a comic , you know how you can tell who the arch-villain 's going to be ? He 's the exact opposite ofthe hero . And most times , they 're friends , like you and me . I should 've known way back when . You know why , David ? Because ofthe kids . They called me Mr Glass .

 ... I 'm afraid you 're gonna stick the dog in the dishwasher . Hey . Come on now , quit it . This is what we dreamed about . What we prayed for . I know , I 'm sorry . I just can 't stop wondering why . Why give up a child ? Give it up to strangers ? God has his reasons and his ways . Mr. and Mrs. Van De Kamp . Hi . This is so hard to find . I 'm so sorry , but there 's a page here that didn 't get signed . - lf l can just get you to do that now ? - Yeah . - Here we go . Right there . - Thanks . I keep asking myself a question . I know there 's been a medical exam . But are you sure he 's okay ? Now , honey . Well , why would the mother give him up ? You should understand . This was a life choice by a single mother . And a terribly difficult decision for her . But I can say , it was only for the good of the child . I want you to meet William . One thousand four hundred and ninety-two . One thousand four hundred and ninety-three . Twenty . They don 't pay me enough . Right there ! Hands in the air ! Turn around and step forward ! Step forward ! Let 's go , tough guy ! All the way down ! Agent Reyes . Agent Scully . Do we know who he is ? He says his name is Miller , but he has no identification on him . Beyond that , we don 't know a lot . Why are the lights off ? . - He wouldn 't speak with them on . - What do you mean ? If you saw him in the light , you 'd understand . Something 's wrong with his face . It 's been severely burned , by fire , maybe acid . And he says he knows me ? And that he 's afraid . A victim of what he calls " The Alien Conspiracy . " If you won 't talk to me , are you gonna talk to her , Mr. Miller ? If she 'll help me , and protect me . Better hope she 's feeling more charitable than I am , partner . Agent Scully . He 's under arrest for assaulting a federal officer . I 've explained to him the penalties , but he still refuses a lawyer . - How did he get in the building ? - We found a card key on him . He says it was given to him by Fox Mulder . - His name is Miller ? - Daniel Miller of Fredericksburg . He gave us an address , but we 're still working on the confirmation . - What are you doing here ? - l came here to find answers . - Answers to what ? - To this . What they did to me . From your scarring , it appears that you 've been burned . Are you claiming that someone burned you and that there is evidence here to incriminate them ? According to Fox Mulder the men who did this are part of a government conspiracy . Go on . You know who these men are . Did Mulder tell you that , too ? When ? If I were to tell you that , you might use the information to find him . Mulder doesn 't want to be found . When I searched him I found those X-Files stuffed inside his clothes . You know who that is ? It 's his sister . - Whose ? - Mulder 's . She was abducted from her home when she was a little girl . Part of this same government conspiracy . You seem to know a lot , Mr. Miller . It gives an impression either that you are telling the truth or you just want us to believe that you are . Well , if I thought you 'd believe me , I wouldn 't have snuck in here . Agent Doggett , would you please arrange the transfer of this man to Quantico ? I 'd like to personally examine his injuries . From the tissue quality , your scarring is fairly recent . The extent of it severe , but it 's not from burning or chemicals . No . What is it , then ? Mr. Miller ? I was injected . injected with what ? I don 't know. lt burned throughout my whole body , inside and out . Agent Scully ? Agent Reyes ? I need to speak to you . What is it , Agent Doggett ? I 've been out running this man 's supposed id . There are seven Daniel Millers in Fredericksburg and I can tell you he isn 't one of them . Then who is he ? I got an idea . But you 're not gonna believe it . Who is he ? You asked him how he got into the fbi , how he knows what he knows ? He said that he contacted Agent Mulder , that Mulder told him . I don 't think so . I don 't think Mulder told him anything . I think that how he got in here , and the reason he knows what he knows is because that man in there is Mulder . That 's ridiculous . - lt 's absurd . - ls it ? What is true and what we want to be true aren 't always the same . I 'll telling you , that 's not Mulder . I hope you prove me wrong . Can you open your mouth , sir ? I need to look at your dental work . You 're not gonna tell me I need braces , are you ? Now your eyes ? Are you going to help me ? I don 't know how I can . Help me make them pay for this . You refer to them as if I know them , or know where they are . They did terrible things to you , too , when you were abducted . Sir , you 've given us a false name . We know that your name is not Daniel Miller . No , it 's not . What is it ? I can 't say . Why lie to us , if you want us to help you ? Because there are people working here at the fbi who would kill me if they knew I was being held here . The same people who would kill Mulder . - You can put your clothes back on . - l 'm asking for your help . But I might be able to help you . How can you help me ? You 're looking for answers , too . We 're both looking for answers . It 's not him . It 's not Mulder . - You 're absolutely sure of that ? - Yes . And so will we all be once you bring me back his DNA test . What do we do with him now ? Admittedly , he 's lying about who he is . But the danger to him may be real . We need to figure out what he wants , and then see if he lies about that , too . And how are we gonna do that ? First I think we need to quietly get him back to D.C. To fbi headquarters . You came here looking for something . What is it that you hoped to find ? I didn 't find it . You stole several files pertaining to the 1973 abduction of Mulder 's sister . But , yet , you say there 's danger to your life right now . The conspiracy to keep the truth about aliens from the American public all but destroyed a few years ago has given rise to a new conspiracy in the government now by men who are alien themselves . And what does this have to do with you ? What you can see they did to me was a failed attempt to turn me into one of these alien men . I was a guinea pig , a test subject . And now I want to expose their evil plans . What plans are those ? To do this to you . To everyone . Mulder said there were files here . Cases like mine . He gave me names and case numbers , but I don 't see them . They 're not here . Someone 's already removed them . Yes . Who ? This is what you 're looking for . Trust me . Thank you . - What are you doing ? - Proving Agent Doggett wrong . - That that 's not Mulder in there . - How ? I don 't understand . Mulder and I agreed to take those files out of the X-Files office and leave them here for safekeeping . Mulder would have known where they were . And that man in there didn 't . What are you doing ? Get away from the crib ! - The baby was crying . - lt 's none of your business . I 'm sorry. I heard so much about William . Mulder told me how he missed him . Well if that 's true , then where the hell is he ? Just tell me where he is ! - You don 't want to know . - l have to know ! - He 's in pain . Terrible pain . - Then let me go to him . - There 's nothing you can do . - That 's not for you to decide ! You know as well as I , that 's Mulder 's decision . I ... . He begged me to honor it . For your safety , and William 's . - Here , Dana . Let me take him for you . - No . Please , may I ? I want to hold him . - Mr . Miller . - No , it 's important I do this . I want to hold him for Mulder . He 's so beautiful . Assistant Director ? You said you 've spoken to the lab ? I got some advance info on the exam that Scully performed on the man . - What ? - The blood type matches Mulder 's but there are aspects of the physiology that aren 't a match . - Such as ? - Well , the body mass , of course . He 's shorter and weighs considerably less than Mulder did . You haven 't seen this guy , what they 've done to him . The way he 's twisted , he 's like an old man . - He could be 100 years old . - l 'm just relaying the facts . And the fact is , he 's not 100 years old , is he ? Not the way he attacked you . Well , whoever he is , he wants something . He says he wants revenge against the people that burned him and Mulder directed him to the files and the people who did it . That makes no sense . Mulder knows those files inside out . Why would he direct him ? Why not just tell him ? Skinner . Yeah . You 're sure about that ? Right . What ? That was the lab . They were able to rush the PCR test , and they have a definitive DNA result . What is it ? Where is this man right now ? It 's all been a good act . I don 't know what you mean . I think you do . You knew those files were here . You just pretended not to , so that I 'd bring you here to see William . No . I want the truth from you . - What truth ? - The truth that you won 't speak . - l want the same truth you do . - Don 't do this to me . Not you . I didn 't come here to upset you . I didn 't plan on being caught . I know your life must be hard , raising a son , not knowing if you 'll see Mulder again . - How do you know my life ? - l know what Mulder knows . I know they used you to create the child . I know they continue to use you to take care of it and raise it . - What are you saying ? - You know what I 'm saying . Your son , your child is part alien . Just tell me who you are . Come on , just say your name . Say it ! Just say it ! Agent Scully . Could you please leave , and close the door ? Can you step out , please ? - This was a private conversation . - l understand. I 'm sorry . - Do you know who that man is ? - Yes , I do . Agent Scully ? What is this ? - What ? - We got DNA results . A positive id . It 's not him . He wouldn 't say these things . DNA 's a match to Fox Mulder 's . It 's not him . Can we get you anything ? No , thank you . I just need a minute . Where 'd he go ? I don 't know. I 'll go check the nursery . Monica , stay with Scully ! Hey ! No more running , Mulder . We 're gonna protect you now . Give him some time . You 're gonna live , buddy . Think that 's gonna scar ? We 're gonna talk . But first , you 're gonna get some sleep . So what now ? What do you mean ? What do you want to do ? Keep it a secret , for starters . Well , that 's not gonna be hard . Nobody 's ever gonna believe that that 's Mulder . Somebody did this to him . Whoever that is , is gonna know it 's him . I mean , that 's what he 's afraid of . If he 's so afraid , then why did he run ? You still don 't believe it 's him . You know a person in so many ways . Ways that a test can 't even begin to know . I 'll be happy to run his DNA again for you . But I don 't have to tell you what a long shot it is . It came up a perfect match . You asked why he 'd run . Stop and think how hard this is for him , the way he looks . If that was Mulder , I wouldn 't care . But he cares . He has to . Maybe he 's ashamed . Of what ? Not just the way he looks . You let him go to protect him , only he couldn 't protect himself . You believe that ? I don 't know . We 'll have a better sense when he wakes up . It 's okay . is he okay ? Oh , my God , there 's blood ! Oh , my God ! There 's blood on the sheets . What did he do to him ? - Where 's Dr. Edwards ? - l 'm Dr. Newman. I 'll take your baby . - He 's been injected with something . - We 'll take him straight to Trauma ! - Okay , airways are open . - Lungs are clear . Heart rate slightly elevated . Skin is warm , nondiaphoretic . I spoke to a Dr. Edwards . - l 'm Dr. Edwards . Agent Reyes ? - Yes . This is Dana Scully . What has he been injected with ? I have no idea. I don 't know . - We 'll run some tests . - l 'm a medical doctor . Can l- - Good . Then you know what this is all about . You just need to sit tight for me and let us do our job . What 'd you do to him ? What 'd you do ? Where 'd you put it ? is this it ? is this what you used ? - Answer me ! - Yes . If anything happens to that kid , I 'm gonna take you out personally . I don 't care who the hell you are . Here she comes . - How is he ? is he all right ? - He 's good . He 's doing fine . Oh , God . Can she see him ? We have him in Step Down right now , as a precaution . But I think he 'll be going home in no time . - What did you find ? - Nothing . How could you find nothing ? There would have to be something . There 's some bruising on the head where something broke the skin but he 's fine . What about a tox screen ? There 's an elevated amount of iron in his blood but other than that , your son is completely normal . That doesn 't make sense . No . I think it does . It makes perfect sense now . I 've seen my share of the hideous , of the disgusting , and the repellant . But you , sir , are the most perfect expression I will ever see of all that is vile and hateful in life . That may well be . But for a moment , you believed it . That I was him . I never believed it . You wanted to believe . You are as false as your face . I bet you wish , night and day , that that bullet that was meant to kill you had succeeded . I don 't believe this . What ? Who this is . You 're wrong about that . When I look in the mirror , I see something much different than the world sees . He could destroy my face and my dignity when he shot me in that office . But he couldn 't destroy the one thing I love most . My hatred of him . Your cigarette smoking son of a bitch of a father . And Mulder 's . You counted on the DNA . That we 'd buy it without question and not look any further . DNA is what Mulder shared with Jeffrey Spender . Half brothers , raised apart . That 's about all that Mulder and I ever shared . You haven 't seen Mulder , have you ? You haven 't even talked to him . So , getting caught at the fbi winning our trust , was all towards one thing . It was only to get to William . Sitting here , you 'd wish me dead . Shortly , I 'll do you the favor . I had this checked . It 's an unknown metal that you injected into my son . It 's a form of magnetite . A gift . A gift ? Having failed as a conspirator to control alien colonization my father wanted nothing more than to see the world fail , too . So what , you 've prevented it now ? You prevented alien colonization by injecting this metal into my son ? Your son is the one thing the aliens need . I took revenge on my father by taking William away from them . So , he 's all right now ? I mean , just like that ? So it 's over ? They 'll let him be ? It 'll never be over . They 'll always know what he was . They 'll never accept what he is . - Well , I can protect him . - And if you can 't ? Look at me . What they did ... . ls this what you want for your son ? Dana ? The room 's all fresh for you . I threw out all the old bedding and bought some brand new stuff , okay ? Thank you . I know it 's impossible to stop thinking about what he said . About William . But it 's all lies , Dana . And you were the one who proved it . And how should I prove it now ? By insisting that I can protect him ? Only to learn too late that I can 't . You say it as if you have a choice . He didn 't have a choice to come into this life . I don 't have a choice about what he is , or was . But I do have a choice about the life my son will have . And shouldn 't I choose that he never have to be afraid of anyone or anything ? And can I ever really even promise him that ? But who can ? Look , dear ! Sweet dreams , baby boy .

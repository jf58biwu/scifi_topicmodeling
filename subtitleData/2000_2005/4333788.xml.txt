 Previously on Cleopatra 2525 : We finally extracted a power cell from a Bailey . Please listen to me . My brother is preparing to leave ... for your underworld as we speak . He intends to destroy it . Cleo ! Sarge , it 's okay . It 's speaking to me . I 've seen that before . I - I - I 'll disarm it . Go . Cleo ! I 'm almost there ! Ugh . Uh , I got it . That doesn 't make sense . I mean those Aquafreaks were all set to destroy the underground . Isn 't that what the Bailies want ? I don 't know . Is it ? Any chance in hell the Bailies are gonna understand ... we 're on a peace mission up here ? Well , they did help us stop those Aquaguys from flooding the underground . You know , maybe this whole Bailey war is just a big misunderstanding . Yeah , I 'm sure it was just a mix-up they drove every human being off the face of this planet . I did say a big misunderstanding . Bailies . Let 's get to work . Hel , I know you have your doubts about this . But if the Bailies do want to keep humanity alive it challenges every assumption we 've ever made about them . We have to know why . Shields ? Not yet . This is supposed to be a peace mission , remember ? Hel , show them our peace offering . Here goes nothing . Oh , they recognize it . They know we have one of their pods . Do you hear that ? Hear what ? I don 't know . Return what you have taken . I can hear them . Hel , Cleopatra must have retained residual link with the Bailies from her previous empathic contact . What are they saying , Cleo ? I think they want their pod back . We 'll put that on the table . But first , let 's negotiate a cease-fire . They definitely want their pod back . Fall back ! Come on ! Hel ! Go ! I 'm coming . Jump ! No . What about Hel ? Hel would want you to jump . Hel ! Go , Sarge . Go ! Great . Five hundred years into the future she will enter a world where machines rule the earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home .

Apparently , they want to capture you alive . Apparently . Have you also detected that the shaft entrance is destroyed ? I need you to find me another way home , Voice . There 's a ventilator outlet two kilometers to the northwest . Two kilometers ? Is that the closest way home ? Unless you care to start digging , I 'm afraid so . And , Hel , your gauntlet telemetry indicates your shield strength is at 20 % and falling . Great . How much longer till total shield failure ? 10 minutes , 36 seconds . Then , I guess I 'd better get moving . Hel , hold your position . A girl just can 't catch a break around here . How long ? Hel 's shield will fail in 9 minutes , 52 seconds . " Peace mission , " my ass . I 'm going back up there . Wait . You won 't stand a chance against four Bailies . So what would you like to do , Cleo ? Leave her up there ? Hel walked into a Betrayer factory to save you . She 's your friend . So are you . And if you go up there and get killed I 'll be running a little low in the friends department . We need a plan . Voice is leading Hel to the vent shaft here . That 's two kilometers . Hel 's in good shape . She can run a 2 " K " in nine minutes . Yeah , but remember , she 's gonna be dodging the Bailies . Perhaps she doesn 't have to run . Yeah . Bitching set of wheels . It 's a pet project of mine . A 23rd century shaft racer . Before they were outlawed . Dual ion pulse engines . Quaduranium boost pump . And a few modifications of my own . It reminds me of Maggie . Maggie ? My little car back in the 20th . ' 66 Mustang . Very sweet . So this thing flies ? In theory . The biggest challenge was synthesizing a stable fuel . So , what do you use for motion lotion ? Go-go juice ? Gas ? The Bailey energy pod ? It delivers a seemingly inexhaustible supply of energy . It 's been running Cleopatra 's hair-drying device for weeks . Cleo , you okay ? Yeah . I still get weird vibes from that thing . Mauser , I don 't care what powers your toy , can you make it fly ? I believe so . Ah . Uh , how come you get to drive ? You 're not automatically better at everything than I am . I played Nintendo . Hang on . Surface coming up . Three , two , one . Oh ! Okay .

Bailies behind us ! Behind us , Sarge ! Punch it ! Hello , hello . Hang on . Okay . I can 't shake them . Something 's wrong . It 's not responding . It 's like it 's fighting against me . Come on ! Getting a little airsick here . Come on , you stupid piece of garbage . What the ... That wasn 't Bailey fire . Man , I hate coming up here . Hel , the surface is our destiny . Our destiny . Yeah , I know . I know , to fight the Bailies for the mud and the , ow ... thorns . And those things that suck your blood . What is that ? Mosquitoes ? Ugh . Yeah , mosquitoes . Oh . You know , sometimes a climate-controlled sub-level is not a bad thing . Hel , the vent shaft is only a few hundred meters ahead . It 's gonna be a long few hundred meters . Ah . Come on , you antique pile of refuse from a Trog slag . Easy , girl . That 's right , baby . Sarge didn 't mean those nasty things she said . Bad Sarge . She won 't respond to you , Sarge . " She " ? Hel , your shield is nearly exhausted . Hurry . How the hell are you doing that ? It 's the Bailey energy pod . We 've got that psychic connection , remember ? Don 't ask me how I know , but she won 't respond to your hostility . She just likes me better , hmm . Uh . No offense , but ... Whoa ! Okay . Come on , girl . Think you can just ask her , pretty , please , to get us the hell out of here ? Roger Wilco . Oh ! Voice ! Hel at 12 . Keep her steady . Okay . I don 't think so , boys . Okay , go up for the Bailey . Going up . Fire ! That 's right , Maggie . You go , girl . Somebody order pizza ? Where did you guys get this thing ? Cleo 's driving ? Hey , Sarge isn 't automatically better at everything than I am . Cleo , get us out of here . Go ! Okay . All right ! Is that what I think it is ? Yeah . Show me . Just point and shoot . I can 't get a clear shot . Cleo , hold it steady . Roger Dodger . Easy , girl . Oh , yeah , you got it , baby . Whoo . Ooh ! I feel the need for speed . Okay . We 've got more boogers coming in . Bogies , Sarge . Yeah , well , whatever . We got two more at 2 : 00 . Hold them off for a few more seconds . Here we go . Cleo ! All right , Maggie . I know you can do it . Underground coming up . A few cuts and bruises . Not even worth warming up the healing tube . Welcome home , Hel . Thanks , Mauser . And thank you . That 's some pretty fair rescuing out there , guys . Well , you know , we do what we can . Well , I 'm glad you do . But I still want to know how Cleo was able to fly like that . I 'm a bit curious about that myself . Well , let me tell you , Hel . There is a sacred bond between a woman and her ride . You know what I 'm saying ? Maybe not . Let 's go get that sand out of your hair . Yeah . Okay . Yeah , let 's go do that . Oh , you guys were just incredible . You , uh ... You did a good job . What is she doing ? Sarge ? Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

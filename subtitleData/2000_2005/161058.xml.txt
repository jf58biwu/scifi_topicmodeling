 Barbara , is there a doctor on duty ? We 've got a problem here . Remove the helmet . It 's not a helmet . It 's a thought inhibitor . And that 's not a wise idea . She 's a dangerous woman . How ... dangerous can she be ? She can read minds . Then she 'll know you 're afraid of her . So what ? Take off the inhibitor . She 's capable of controlling other people 's minds . There are six men here . If she tries to control one of us , the other five - can put that thing back on . - With all due respect , you are new here , sir . Now , I think we should contact the research leaders and find out whether it 's safe - to keep it on , or .. - I have been left in charge of night care . I will not bother the leaders until I have a diagnosis . Now , remove the helmet . Damn ... she 's fine . Hello . You ... have a nosebleed . I 'm just going to cauterise it with this laser . Put the laser on the armrest , so you have your hands free to give proper care . There . As good as new . You don 't want to put that back on her . It 's inhuman what they 're doing to this beautiful young woman . Er ... this is inhuman . Let 's let her breathe a while . No . We put it back on immediately . Don 't listen to that militaristic automaton . He 's usurping your authority You 're in charge . No . - I 'm in charge . - Doctor , you are acting irrationally . Now , I believe she is influencing your thought . I 'm going to put it back on now . Five dead . Six shots . Sloppy . But I am right-handed . Oh , Dr Huggins . Your scientific mind might find this quite amusing . With all my remarkable powers , it still took me six months to make my nose bleed . Life 's such a mystery . Oh , and thank you so very much for your kind thoughts . 500 years into the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth Electronic dance music Par-ty ! Whoo ! OK , spoil my fun . Tell me why we 're really here . I 'm serious , Sarge . Voice told us to come here and she stopped communicating with me . - So is this a mission , or what ? - I don 't know . Hey , what if this was our mission ? To have a good time . Voice knows we 've worked hard . Maybe she just wants us to party like it 's 2999 , baby ! - Whoo ! - You know , I hate to admit it ... .. but sometimes the kid 's got a few ideas . I 'm gonna mingle . If Voice contacts you , let me know . - Mm-hm . - Oh , Hel ... - check him out . - Ladies . Hi . Care to exchange life-support fluids ? You 've got this one . Uh , I 'll catch you next millennium . OK ? Too bad . You know what they say . Once you go cyborg , you never go back . Cool . Hey , cool ! Rock ! Yeah , yeah ... Workin ' it , workin ' it . Oh , yeah , yeah ... go . Whoo ! She dances like moon silver . I can 't feel my legs . I wonder if she 's real . Is that his hand on my leg ? What a creep . Voice has sent us here to do something , but what ? And why wouldn 't she just explain it all to me ? That 's not like her . There you go . Thanks . Hel , isn 't it ? And you are ? A friend . I 've come to talk about Voice . She 's disappeared and you 're worried . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Perhaps Voice has lost faith in you . I 've seen it before . She 'll abandon a team leader in the middle of a mission for no apparent reason . You have to talk to her . Whoo , girl ! OK , I admit he was no Brad Pitt , but ... hey , who cares ? Hel , what 's wrong ? Where did that woman go ? Woman ? - She was helping . We talked about Voice . - You talked about Voice to a stranger ? No . No . It wasn 't like that . I didn 't . It ... It was like she was in my head . Oh , boy . Be careful . I used to date a shrink who could do that . Very scary . Sarge ... Whoa ! Go away . Hel 's acting really weird . She 's out of her element . She 'll be OK . Have you ever heard the expression " They don 't buy the cow if they get the milk for free " ? What 's a cow ? All right , beautiful . Don 't ruin it by saying something stupid . This is too easy . Say , why don 't you and I go someplace , get buck-naked , and do the belly-belly game ? What an idiot . Oh , well . I didn 't want him for his brains , anyway . It must have been a while , huh ? Fun 's over . Oh ! Time for paranoia ! WOMAN : Why don 't you tell her what 's bothering you , pretty boy ? You 're not a Betrayer , are you ? Of course not . Why would you even ask that ? It 's just that I heard rumours that Betrayers come to this place to pick up people and ... do who knows what to them . I 'm sure it 's just rumours . I have no idea why I just said that . Why would Voice tell us to come to a bar where there 's been Betrayer rumours , and not warn us ? Maybe she did warn us , and Hel just didn 't want to tell me . She and Voice have been pretfy tight lately . Maybe I 'm out of the loop , suddenly . Maybe there 's no loop to be out of . Whoo ! Woo ! Hey , Hel . How are you doing ? Something 's wrong . I have to talk to Voice . Hold on . You 're not going anywhere . Huh ? Oh . Right . Right . You know best , Cleo . OK . Now you 're really scaring me . Come on . Come on . Hey , you wanna go - freefall in the shaft ? - Later . She says she 's lost contact with Voice , then she brings us here . A place crawling with Betrayers . I don 't like it . Just have a lean , OK ? ELECTRONIC New on the evil top ten and making a rapid climb to the top - Raina ! You said Hel was acting weird . What did you mean ? .. escapee from Level T-64 's loony bin , she 's got the down and dirty on mind control . She was talking to a stranger at the bar about Voice . - What stranger ? - Have you seen this vixen ? - Her ! - If the answer 's yes , you may already be dead . Sarge ! We 're in danger . No . You are . Betrayer . Put ... the weapon down , Sarge . Back off ! It all makes sense now . The disappearance of Voice , the secret meeting with a stranger . You were going to eliminate us , but you didn 't count on me figuring it out . Betrayer . Sarge , it 's Hel ! Are you nuts ? Not that I have a problem with that . Uh-uh ... What , so now you 're on her side ? Uh-huh ... I mean , no . No . I 'm with you both . We 're a team , remember ? Can 't we just get along ? - With a Betrayer ? Never ! Raina 's gotten to Sarge . Sarge , if you hurt Hel , you 're going to regret it . Shields are gone , Betrayer . Wait . Wait . I know that Sarge has totally lost it , but it 's still Sarge . It 's either this or we let her pick us off , one at a time . Go ! Fire at will ! Come on , Sarge . It 's either you or Hel . Who 's it gonna be ? That 's it , girls . Sooner or later , Voice will be along to sort it out . And once she 's talking to Hel , I 'll be able to read her thoughts too . It won 't be long before I find out where she is . - Now what ? ! - Put these on . You 're going back to the lab . Me ? ! Why ? You 've got to get Mauser to build something to control Raina 's powers . Climbing those shafts makes me dizzy . All you have to do is go up a couple of levels , cross the Sentine Corridor , and then straight to the lab shaft . It 's simple . I believe in you . Now , do it ! - But without these you 'll be defenceless . - Then you 'd better hurry ! Oh ... OK ... Ahhhh ! Off to see Mauser . I think I 'll tag along . Whoa ! Uh . You had to miss those tae bo classes , didn 't you ? Aaaargh ! Wait ! - Is this some kind of Betrayer trick ? - No . No tricks . Just the truth . Look at me , Sarge . Not with your mind , with your heart . There was a woman in here earlier . She could control our thoughts . She tried to turn me against Voice and you against me . Oh , come on , Sarge . If I were a Betrayer , you 'd be dead by now . Hel ... Yeah . I was hoping once Raina left you 'd come around . How are you feeling ? Confused . This woman , Raina , she knows Voice . - Is she a Betrayer ? - No . She 's human . Or some advanced form of human . If Voice speaks to me , she can hear it by reading my thoughts , and I think Voice thinks that it 'll compromise her security . Where 's Cleo ? In trouble . Let 's go . When I sent Cleopatra to Mauser , Raina must have followed her . That 's what snapped you out of it . - So , what 's the plan ? - Don 't have one . Look , if I had one , Raina would have read my thoughts and she 'd be one step ahead of us . We 're going to have to be spontaneous . Huh ? OK . Now I 'm lost . It must be the other way . On the other hand ... I 've seen Hel do this before . Aaaargh ! Is there a problem , Cleopatra ? - Mauser , we need a ... - A mind inhibitor . I know . Voice contacted me . I 've improved the design by combining an alpha wave blocker ... Just ... Whatever . Great . Give it to me . I 'll take it . You 've been very helpful , Cleopatra . But ... I won 't be needing you again . Back off , you major headcase . - I 'll blow you to pieces . - Sarge , no ! - What are you doing ? - We have to wait for Voice 's orders . - She doesn 't want Raina killed . - Let 's do it the old-fashioned way . I did good , right ? Yeah . You did good . I don 't like her . She 's a creepy one . Now , girls , this inhibitor 's not a toy . OK , Voice . I choose to believe that you stayed out of touch because you knew Raina would read my mind . Exactly I take it you have a history with her . Raina was once very much like you . And what 's that supposed to mean ? Voice ? Voice ? Voice ? Oh , now you stay away . Voice ? ! Voice ! Next week : 105-106 Home and Rescue

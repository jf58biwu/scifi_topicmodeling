 Why don 't you stare at this for a little while , ya ugly bastard . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm taking the specimen . well , you can 't . I haven 't prepped the cryostasis chamber . I don 't want him frozen , Rowan . I want him soft . We 've already discussed this . well , I had to go over your head . I 'm moving him to our Scranton facility . Doctor Wimmer , you can 't risk transporting him through open country . This isn 't open for discussion . His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue , I mean , itjust-itjust cries out for more research . And you 're willing to risk the death of innocent civilians if he escapes . Yes . But I 'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his men can handle the transferjustfine . Sergeant ? Everything 's under control , ma 'am . Doctor Wimmer , please . Rowan , he 's no Ionger your problem . Can we get that rag off him ? What the hell ? Oh , my God ! - Get outta here . - What happened ? I 'm sorry . Cryogenic breach . Emergency lock-down . Oh , God , no . Oh . No . Kay-Em ? No viruses , no bacteria . No toxins. lt 's clean . It 's still cold . Someone want to tell me what that is ? It 's like a big kind off-frozen s-storage thing ? probably a cryostasis unit . I 'd guess early Port series . Kay-Em ? Quadroport eleven . Manufactured in Twenty-ten . Precise historic records are inconsistent . - Anyone thinking ' what I 'm thinkin ' ? - Open it up . What the hell is that ? Humanoid . Organic composition is unclear . Can someone tell me what 's on his face ? Uh , some kinda twentieth-century carbon filtration unit ? - It 's a hockey mask . - Very good , Tsunaron . What 's a hockey mask ? facial armor . Used in a sport outlawed in Twenty-Twenty-Four . Amazing . absolute museum quality . Are you paying attention , AzraeI ? Yeah . well , don 't touch anything . Guys . We got another body here . Kay-Em ? She 's perfectly preserved . cell crystallization 's at 25 percent . Twenty-five percent ? Suggest extensive nanotech and phase one cell reconstruction . Wait-Waita minute , areyou ... are you saying that ... that we can bring her back to life ? Yes . But she is deteriorating . Opening the door has compromised her hibernation . Lou , get ready for dust-off . We have a priority evac . Copy that , ready in five . Notfive , now . What the- - ? Look out ! Fifty-five cc 's ofetherene . You 'II be fine . F-Fine ? I 'm missing my arm ! Oh , you 're so pretty . - Kicker , are the doors secure ? - Locked and blocked . beautiful . Liftoff in three , two ... I Iove this part . What 'd you find ? Won 't believe it . Get the sarge on the horn . Didyou hear ? Division four justenteredthe occupiedzone . - casualties ? - minimal . You know , I 'd love to know how we got this screwed-up gig . Yeah , well , I didn 'tjoin the corps to become a friggin ' baby sitter . - Brodski , here . - Sarge , we founda viable down here . Say again ? We found two bodies in deep cryostasis . The Kay-Em unit thinks we can resuscitate the female . female ? Yeah . Crutch , do you copy ? Crutch , doyou readme ? Crutch , wake the hell up . - Yeah , what do you want ? - They 're on their way back . Prepare for docking and power up the lab . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Whatever . - So , what does she look like ? - She 's cute . Yeah . And single . I 'm so lonely . We need to get her to the lab . - You think you can bring her back ? - We 'II find out , sergeant . - You 're not gonna bring him back ? - No , it 's impossible . Aw , shit . I forgot my arm . Yeah , here you go , dumb-ass . Hi , hand . - Any idea how long she 's been down ? - Four-point-five-five centuries . Must 've been one hell of a wake-up call . - I 'm bitchy as hell when I wake up . - Did you just wake up ? - Kinsa . - You guys always find the cool shit . - Where 's WayIander ? - He 's in lab one , charging the bed now . Good . Find Stoney and Adrienne and get to lab two . Once we 're in the clear , I 'd Iike to check your circuits . Oh , I 'II bet you would . It isn 't like that . - Adrienne , good . I need you in lab two . - You found something , didn 't you ? - Two viabIes . - Two ? In what condition ? Perfect . We 're attempting reanimation with one ofthem . Great , what can I do ? - You , Stoney and Kinsa they 're second ... - They 're gonna slow me down . Just walk them through it , okay ? Run a complete structural scan , log them in properly and put them in stasis . - I 'II check back with you later . - Fine . Okay , where are we ? The board 's all green , teach . The N-two 's warm and ready . Good . Kay-Em , begin stabilizing any cellular fractures . Yes , professor . Janessa , I need a full scan . glycerol levels , cerebral profusion , the whole works . I Iive to serve , professor . Let 's see what we 're deaIin' with here . DecrystaIization ofthe membranes is now atThirty-two percent . Good . Somebody get those clothes off her . Oh , I got it ! I got it . honestly . WayIander ... where 's her diffusion barriers ? Seventeen and stable . Here we go . Stay still or you 'II end up getting an elbow where your wrist should be . Specimen forty-four twenty found in sector 39-30 L on Earth prime . Subject discovered in complete cryosuspension . - How 's it goin ' ? - Good , man . What 's up ? - Hey , where do you want this ? - On the specimen table . - Hi , baby . - Hey , gorgeous . Initiating scan . Mm , smart and sexy . Professor . Take a look atthisguy 's scan . Amazing . How does he function with a brain that small ? - Way manages . - That 's very funny . - He 's a big boy . - I bet he 's hung like a mammoth . Okay , you guys . You know what ? Just get the hell outta here ... and come back when you 're more focused . - You serious ? - Yes , just go . - Thanks , Adrienne . Come . - Thanks . Don 't mention it . See whatyou can salvage from the optic cortex . - Then move on . - My pleasure , professor . Ready phase two . Bring on the ants . That 's it . Come to mama . Temperature , ninety-six-point-two . Ninety-seven . cool . It 's working . Ninety-eight-point-six and holding . cell reconstruction is complete . internal de-fib in three ... two ... one . Easy . Easy . vital signs are normal and strong . No shit . Easy . Easy . Oh , d- - Did ya get him ? Where is he ? tell me you got him . Got who ? Uh , n-n-n-no one 's here . You 're s-safe with us . There was a I-There was a leak i-in the cryo-unit and ... . Ho , was he contained ? It was contained . But when the cryo-unit ruptured , you didn 'tescape it . ltputyou into stasis . For how long ? The year is twenty-four fifty-five . Now , l-l-lknow this is a huge shock ... butyou 'regonna be safe here . You 're aboard GrendeI , a cIass-four , catamaran transport ship . We 're on our wayback home and ... you 'regonna bejustfine . Twenty-four fifty-five ? That 's over four hundred years . Secure line . Perez , Dieter . solaris Research Station . Connect . Lowe . You bastard . We 've hit the mother lode . Do you know what time it is ? I don 't care . We 've got a goldmine . A box of DVDs is not a goldmine . Now , I 've told ya , I can 't move . Just look at the file . Two four-hundred-year-oId frozen specimens . One weII-preserved ... the other one . Are you ready for this ? Up and walking around . Four hundred years old ... and walkin ' around . Yeah . Four hundred and fifty-five years , to be exact . Who cares ? Who gives a shit ? people . people will pay huge money to see her . Let me ask you a question . Is this the first person you 've reanimated ? Ofcourse not . How many people are out there today , walkin ' around thawed out and lookin ' good ? - Hundreds . - Thousands . Maybe . But notfour hundred and fifty years old . She 's nearly twice as old as anyone on the planet . Two-fifty , four-fifty , what 's the difference ? Doctor , a hundred years ago when reanimation was more unpredictable , sure , maybe . But now ... it 's old news . Damn it . I need money . Oh , I know . I know . The other viable is marked " Voorhees . " That 's notJason Voorhees , is it ? - What do you know about him ? - Jason Voorhees . Oh , he killed nearly two hundred people ... and simply disappeared without a trace . Why , to the right buyer he could be worth , uh , a fortune . well , I 've got him frozen right here on the ship . You work out a list ofownership ? No list . He 's my find . He 's-He 's mine . What about your students ? well , they 're students . The educational experience will be enough . Doctor , doctor , you are one son ofa bitch . Soon to be one rich son ofa bitch . Lowe out . I think that , uh , we need to talk about my midterm . Poor baby . No wonder you wore this thing . Harder . Harder . Who 's been a naughty little boy ? M-I have . Oh . Harder . You want it a little harder ? Yeah ? How 's that ? - Yeah . Oh , good . - Yeah ? - Yeah . That 's it . - That 's it , right there ? - Oh , yeah . - Yeah ? - Daddy likes it hard ? - Yeah . Yeah . - Daddy wants it hard , huh ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - Oh , yeah . That 's it ... - Right there ? - Yeah . - You like it right there ? - Yeah .

Look , Kay-Em , I don 't think this is going to work . Why do you want those things anyways ? - Janessa has them . - well , Janessa 's ... . - real ? - Yes . Let 's not complicate things , all right ? I Iike you just the way you are . I think you 're perfect . Okay . help , WayIand ! No ! Somebody help me ! help me ! No ! No ! No ! No ! I brought you something to eat . Not much longer and we 'II be at Earth Two . Earth Two ? What happened to Earth One ? Yeah , well , it 's dead . The oceans , the soil , neither will sustain life . Can I do anything else for you ? You wanna tell me what happened down there ? I take it being stabbed and frozen wasn 't part ofyour plan . I 'm a ... I was a project leader at crystal Lake Research . The subject was Jason Voorhees . Jason Voorhees ? Notorious murderer ? We executed him for the first time in two thousand eight . For the first time ? We tried everything . EIectrocution , gas , firing squad . We even hung him once . Nothing worked . finally , it was decided that ifwe couldn 't terminate him , we could at Ieast contain him . Cryogenic stasis . Freeze him until we could figure out what to do . - Seems sensible . - I thought so . But unfortunately some people who were too smartfor their own good ... felt that a creature that couldn 't be killed was simply too valuable ... tojustfiIe away . In the end , it always comes down to money . How do you thank someone who gives you back your life ? well , you 're gonna be alive for a Iong time . We 'II figure out something . Why don 't you just admit it ? You want me . I couId never be with a girl whose balls are bigger than mine . Guys , our star patient is back . Rowan , this is Tsunaron and Janessa . - Hi . - Hi . Hi . I see that my clothes fit okay . Oh , these are yours . They 're great . Thank you . Whoa . What are those ? These are Janessa 's love children . You see now , it is that wit ofyours that is what repels all human females . And , ofcourse , you 've met Sergeant Brodski . - Yes . Hi , again . - Hi . And this is the lovely Kay-Em Fourteen . Tsunaron 's little Iove-bot . Easy , Janessa . Kay-Em is a knowledge matrix android that I have been programing . Amazing . - She looks so real . - I am real . - Professor , where do you want this ? - Uh , lab two , I think . - Sure . - Thank you . Where did you get that ? Uh , from your friend . The big guy with the hockey mask . - You brought him on board ? - He 's in the next lab . - We 're quite safe . - Safe ? Our scans reveal him to be very dead . could your scans be wrong ? I think you should just get rid of him , professor . He 's too dangerous . well , that would be irresponsible and foolhardy . He 's a valuable scientific artifact that must be carefully preserved . Much like yourself . He is an unstoppable killing machine . He 's not dead . believe me . He 's definitely dead . Show me . I 'm putting us on Iock-down . Attention , we have a hostile on board . - Gruntteam , reportto weapons . - The chick ? Repeat , we have a hostile on board . Gruntteam , reportto weapons . Everyone elsegetto lab one . - Baby , I 'm not ready yet . - well , hurry up . Sarge , grunt team 's assembled . dallas is a no - show .

Let 's get movin ' ! Nothin ' left of him ? What have you got in mind ? Take your kids to lab one and stay there till you hear from me . I just saved your ass . You know , don 't get cocky . I mean , you must really feel like a wuss . Huh , there , big boy ? Hey , check the score , kid . It 's still nine-three . Yeah , but I got my groove on now . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? So , what do you say next kill wins ? Lock and load , killer . You 're goin ' down . You are so goin ' down . Whatthe hell ? - I thought this was an alien sim . - Yeah , it is . Pause play . I said , pause play . - Uh , he 's not pausing . - Yeah , no kidding . I think we need to reboot . - That does not count as a kill . - Oh , yes it does . Okay , screw this . Game over . What the hell ? Hey , drop the kid ! Drop the kid ! Now ! azrael , get outta here ! I got him ! I got him ! azrael ... I got no shot ! Move ! Sergeant Brodski . Don 't leave those kids alone . What the hell 's the matter with you ? We are less than an hour from solaris . They have seven ... fully equipped tactical units there that are more than ... capable oftaking care ofthis . I say we wait and sedate him . - I am takin ' this guy out . - Sergeant , I need him alive . No , you want him alive , but what you need is to get out of my way . Look , there are other considerations . financial considerations . My only consideration is the safety ofthe people on this ship . AII right , a hundred thousand . Two hundred . Five . Five ? - Kicker , dallas not here yet ? - Nope . You , Briggs , find him , bring him up to speed . Condor , you have a BFG ? You 're with me . Sven , Geko , you got the starboard pontoon . Sarge what do we do when we find this guy ? well , I promised the doc we 'd take him alive . Man . So , after you blow him all to hell , put one in his leg so ... - we can say we tried . - Yeah . - Yeah . - Yeah . Oh , Lord . Sarge , I got dallas . - Where the hell is he ? - He 's dead . - Sarge , we got a body in bay two . - Who is it ? It 's Azrael . Whatthe hell 's goin 'on here ? Sarge , we got a blood trail headin' toward the cargo bay . Condor , Kicker and I will take cargo main . The rest ofyou take portside . I hope they know what they 're doing . These guys live for this stuff . Sorry . - Don 't do that ! - Dude . - What ? - You scream like a girl . - Screw you . - You wish . Lou , is that you ? Lou , I swear , you mess with an engineer , you 're gonna wake up in the morning with a waste hose in your bunk . asshole . What the hell ? Crutch , get down now ! - What the hell 's going on here ? - Crutch , out now ! Aw , you wrecked my stuff , man . We nailed him . He 's gotta be here . Condor , air borne . Briggs . Where the hell 's Sven ? Condor , anything topside ? Negative , sarge . There 's no sign ofhim . This isn 't gonna work . Keep your eyes peeled . Everything 's under control . Condor , report .

Take your time , sarge . He ain 't goin ' nowhere . Briggs ... get out of here . Kicker . Briggs . Where are you , damn it ? He 's all alone in there . It 's gonna take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog . Yeah ... that oughta do it . Such a waste . I told him to stay calm . To wait until we got to solaris and then we could take care ofthis ... monster . I said , " Don 't go in unprepared . " Brodski wasjust too proud . Who lockedthe damn door ? Somebody wanna tell me what the hell is goin ' on ? Grunts are dead . - Which ones ? - AII of 'em . Oh . Oh , man . Lou ... how long till we reach solaris ? I 'm takin ' us out of hyperdrive right now . Kids and their goddamn field trips , you know ? Just bring a psycho on board . Yeah , sure . I just know I 'm gonna get blamed for this shit . Solaris to Grendel , we haveyou on approach . Standby fordocking number . grendel to solaris , we need military and medical at the gate . We got a big problem here . real goatfuck . Grendel , what 'syourproblem ? What 'syourproblem ? Look we 're gonna be all right . He 's trapped in the cargo bay . We 're locked up in here . - Can the solaris grunts kill him ? - absolutely . I 've been in constant contact with solaris . They have sixty highly trained professionals standing ... by to get us offthis ship . Solaris to Grendel , pull up . Abortdocking . You 're coming in too fast . Grendel- - What now ? - Warning . Prepare forimpact . - Oh , shit . Hang on ! What 's going on ? What the hell 's goin ' on ? Everyone okay ? - Whatjust happend . - WayIande ? - Yeah . - Yeah . It 's all right . Wejust overshot it . We 'II turn around and go back . Hang on . Oh , my God . solaris is gone . Gone ? - It can 't be gone . - Look for yourself . It 's gone . What are we gonna do ? Lou . What sorta damage we ... Iookin ' at ? I 'm sending out a distress beacon . Lou ? Guys , we 've lost our entire port pontoon . The internal pressure is stable . - The main thrusters are offline . - Life support ? - We should be okay for a while . - But he 's out there . Look , we 're gonna be fine . We 're in a high - volume traffic lane . Another ship 's gonna come by , I-I-I 'm sure of it . We 're-We 're gonna be safe here . Shut up ! What are you doing ? Maybe he gave up . You really think so ? I don 't think he 's out there . Why don 't you just stick your head out and have a peek ? Oh , my God ! Go ! Go ! Janessa , go ! Come on , go ! Move it , move it , move it ! Come on ! Let 'sgo ! Where 's professor Lowe ? Look ... have you considered how valuable you are ? Imean , fame , money . With my help , you 're gonna have it all . Y-I-I-I ... know people , you know ? I mean , I-I have connections ! Together we can-we can make a fortune . We couId- - Oh , shit . Oh , you want your machete back . Shit , it 's yours , take it .

What about it Crutch ? Uh , yeah , I-I can do preIaunch from the bridge . Good , good . The rest of us 'II head to the shuttle . - We 'II start the launch list . - I 'm with you , Crutch . You know how to use that thing ? It 'sjust like riding a bike . Once you learn , you never forget how . Good . Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold . - Meet you at the shuttle bay . - See you there . What 's a bike ? There 's enough fire power in here to level a moon . I say we pack this stuff up and head for the shuttle . So , what do you think ? Are we gonna make it ? well , the statistical probability ofsurvivaI is twelve percent . twelve percent ? Can 't you come up with better odds than that ? No . bullshit , Kay-Em ! That 's bullshit ! well , preparation for launch may be a relatively simple procedure , but getting there alive ? It is a problem . Are you tellin ' me that there 's absolutely no chance ... for us to better our odds ? statistical probability ofsurvivaI just went up to ... fifty-three percent . Wanna go for a hundred ? He 's here . Quiet . But if he 's in here , he 's gonna kill us and- - Quiet ! One more sound , and I 'II snap your neck myself . Got it ? She 's good with people . - Did you see that ? - What ? I think there 's someone still alive over there . We don 't have time for this . - Which way is the shuttle bay ? - Straight through . Go .

You 're lucky you weren 't alive during the Microsoft conflict . hell , we were beatin ' each other with our own severed limbs . That 's nice . Let 's get us home . Kinsa , are you there ? Yes , ma 'am . Crutch ? Prepare for fuel transfers . cells six and seven bypass . hydraulic lifters . Pressurized and dampened . - It 's Brodski , he 's alive . - No shit . Yeah , I-I-I can 't move him . Are Way and Crutch back ? - No , they 're still on the bridge . - I need help . Hey , guys . Brodski 's stillalive butRowan can 'tmove him byherself .

How you doin ' there , Brodski ? - I 'm all right . - Come on let 's get you patched up . Whata mess . Lab two . Tsunaron , is he gonna make it ? absolutely . He 's at eighty percent already . This guy is strong . What the hell ? Way ? We 've got trouble . The collision must have compromised the hull . She 's bleeding out . Oh , no . No , no ... no . Tiamatto Grendel , doyou read ? Over . - Tiamatto Grendel , doyou read ? - Yes ! Uh , Tiamat , this is GrendeI , we read you . Can you hear us ? That 's affirmative , Grendel . We are readingyourdistress beacon . - Areyou in needofassistance ? - That 's very affirmative , Tiamat . How soon can you get here ? Our situation is extremely critical . We 're fourparsecs away , Grendel . ETA ... forty-five minutes . We don 't have that much time . Tiamat , this is GrendeI . Our hull is bleeding out . We 're gonna have ... a core implosion in less than thirty minutes . Do you copy ? We copyyou , Grendel . Advise how you would Iike us to proceed . We 'rejust gonna end up taking them down with us . Tiamat ... ifyou can 't get here in thirty minutes then there 's no point . What ? ! Are you high ? ! Tiamat , this is GrendeI . You just ignore that last idiot , all right ? You-You get your ass out here , okay ? You come here and you save us . Hey , guys , why can 't wejust go over here ? It 's no good . The pontoon goes , it 'II take the bridge with it . - Not ifwe disconnect these walkways . - You can 'tjust disconnect them . We could blow it up . There 's plenty of macrocharge in the weapons hold . This could work . Tiamat , we 're gonna ... try something here . Ifyou 're game , maintain your current course and speed and ... hopefully we 'II see you when you get here . Copy . Seeyou in forty-five minutes . Goodluck , Grendel . Thanks . Let 's blow the walkways . Come on . Let 's split up and set the charges . Who 's got the remote ? - Right here . - We 'II meet up in walkway " B. " Go . AII set . Good to go . hold together , baby . impossible . He 's dead . I 'd say he got better . - He 's been modified . - Oh , ya think ? - Can you take him ? - I can try . You guys might wanna run . Kay-Em ! No ! Waylander ! Brodski , get in here , now ! Come on , guys ! Come on ! - What the hell is goin ' on ? - Jason fuckin ' Voorhees , that 's what 's going on . - blow the charges ! - No ! WayIander 's got the trigger ! Hey ... asshole . I think she 's holding . I think we 're finally okay . I 'd clap if I couId . - Tiamat to grendel . - Come in , Grendel . We have you vectored for approach and emergency docking . You ready to get offthat boat ? Let 's go home . holy ... shit ! We gotta go ! Now ! No ! Janessa ! Janessa ! Don 't let go ! Grab her hand ! Janessa ! Reach out ! Reach ... for it ! Come on ! Come on ! Oh , this sucks on so many levels ! Janessa ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on . Oh . Janessa ! - Shit , he 's still coming ! - Oh , God . Shit , come on . Go ! Which way ? - Let 's go this way . - This way ! This way ! Come on . Tiamat , we 're at the evac door . So am I , GrendeI . lifeline secured . Initiate collar pressurization . Tiamat , open the outer doors . - Damn . - Oh , whatnow ? Tiamat , let 'sgetthatbolt open . I 'vegotthis . I 've got this . Let me try an override . Shit . Oh shit , oh shit . Come on , come on . Our exterior motor 's got no power . - What does that mean ? - Means I 'm going EVA . - EVA ? What 's EVA ? - It 's a space walk . I-If he can jump the lines out there we can reroute them from in here . hopefully , that door will open and we can get offthis thing before ... it blows the hell up . Sounds like a good plan . Tiamat , this is GrendeI . Our escape hatch isjammed . - We 're goin ' EVA to try to patch it up . - You 'd better get a move on . I 'm in the maintenance hatch . We read you , sarge . Opening outer doors . Those hatches aren 't gonna keep him that much longer . We need to buy more time . You 're the expert on this guy , right ? - What are you thinking ? - A diversion . I 'm at the control panels . Rowan , are you there ? Yes . I 'm gonna divert the main power supply unit and send it to you . Gotcha . See the bright blue diode ? Connectit to the terminal . Uh , was that you or me ? That was another part ofyour hull , GrendeI . You are running out oftime . Okay , Tiamat . Just a few more minutes . We can disengage and come around again . Negative , Tiamat . Just another minute . We 'II stand by as long as we can . - You ready , Kay ? - I was built ready , baby . Initiate . I-I-It 's working . He 's buying it . - Whoops . - What do you mean , " Whoops " ? Nothing . Not nothing . You don 'tjust say " oops . " What " oops " ? I think he saw me . Oh , man . Ifyou 've got something brilliant up your sleeve , now 's the time to do it . I-I got something . I got something . Prepare variations using data file crystal Lake , nineteen hundred eight . Kay ? - Here goes nothin ' . - Initiate . - Hey ... you want a beer ? - Or do you wanna smoke some pot ? Or we can have premarital sex . We love premarital sex . Try itnow , Rowan . Here we go .

Hey , are we gonna see you sometime soon ? I 'm on my way . Brodski , where are you ? ! grendel , we can 't keep pressure lock . We 'll disengage in fortyseconds . Kay-Em . Kay-Em . Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six ... five , four ... three , two , one . clear ! No ! No , wait ! Disconnect . He 's coming this way . You 've gotta be kidding me . Brodski ! He 's gone .

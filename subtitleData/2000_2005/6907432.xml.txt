 Aren 't they beautiful ? The stars ! Yeah ... Do you ever get overwhelmed by it ? Yeah I do ... It feels so good to look up at the sky ... Especially a beautiful night sky like this ... Blue skies are great too . Especially the ones that seem to stretch forever ! Yes . But , by staring up at the sky all the time , you won 't be able to move on . Because if you walk facing up you 're going to fall ! People walk , looking straight ahead ! That 's obvious enough . But people often forget ... Make sure you don 't forget , okay ? The path you 're on is a fun one . The scenery around you is delightful . The longing you have for the distant sky is wonderful . It may not always be so fun to keep walking and looking straight ahead ... But that 's when ... I 'll look up at the sky . The place I 'm gazing at might be far away , but something is waiting for us ... That feeling will give me strength . I sound so full of myself ! Uh-uh . I think it 's wonderful , Hajime . I like you . Setsuna ? Come on ! Wake up brother ! Please don 't forget that feeling . Your honest heart ... Your heart is your power . Get up ... Get up ... Please don 't forget . Your heart is your power . Please don 't forget . Your heart is your power . Brother ... Please don 't forget . Your heart is your power . Brother ... Brother , get up ! Huh ? Huh ? Futaba ? Don 't " Futaba " me ! It 's an emergency ! Come here ! An emergency ? What is it ? Hurry up ! Hurry up !

I am . But my , look how big that thing is . I woke up this morning and it was already there . It was quite a surprise . Wasn 't it well worth it to get up early ? It sure was ... Before dawn this morning , a giant aircraft suddenly appeared . Amysterious aircraft above Kanagawa Prefecture Before dawn this morning , a giant aircraft suddenly appeared . Amysterious aircraft above Kanagawa Prefecture Amysterious aircraft above Kanagawa Prefecture It has positioned itself above Tenmo ... It has positioned itself above Tenmo in the Kanagawa Prefecture and has yet to move since then . Live from Tenmo . Our reporter Mr. Yoshida has just arrived at the scene . Are we ready ? Okay . Are you there Mr. Yoshida ? Mr. Yoshida ? Yes , this is Yoshida reporting ! Currently I am on a street called Mikoshizaka in Tenmo . The thing is enormous ! An unbelievably giant aircraft is covering the sky ! What is the situation there ? Yes ? Live from Mikoshizaka in Tenmo Live from Mikoshizaka in Tenmo What are the people 's reactions ? Is there a lot of confusion going on ? Yes , everyone is looking up at the sky worriedly , and are ... Huh ? The citizens of Tenmo are calmly assessing the situation . Lady Momoe ! How is the town looking ? Well , the natives are fine , but ... Taxi ! Taxi ! The people who have recently moved here are bit of a problem . I 'm sure ... There have not been any changes ... There have not been any changes ... Listen ! The Takahashi family ran away too ! ... since our last report . Listen ! The Takahashi family ran away too ! Listen ! The Takahashi family ran away too ! The town could not be more calm ! Listen ! The Takahashi family ran away too ! The town could not be more calm ! The town could not be more calm ! And the Yamaguchi family is packing their stuff up ! Enough , Futaba ! What are we going to do ? Are we going to evacuate too ? Evacuate where ? I bet school is closed today ! Let 's go somewhere ! Evacuating isn 't the same as going somewhere fun , you know ! I wonder who it could be this early ? It might be dad . Hey , good morning ! Dad ? What is this ? It 's amazing ! Dad ? Morning , Futaba . Kazuo ... Were you surprised ? I told you my cell phone was a good one . Whatever you say . Long time no see , Hajime . Yeah . I wanted to have a lengthy discussion with you , but ... That cellphone is pretty useful , huh ? Yeah , I 'm putting it to good use ! How are the other people doing ? The Takahashi family and Yamaguchi family both got in their cars and took off ! The Nakajima family is going nuts right now too and ... Futaba ! But it 's true ! I see . But is that the only damage there is ? That 's impressive . You can 't really blame the people who aren 't natives of Tenmo for running away ... Because they don 't know anything . What are you going to do ? I 'm going to stay , because I want to see the outcome of what 's about to happen . I see . I 'm sure the government will be making an official announcement soon , but it 's all right . It 's true that something immensely significant is going to happen in Tenmo but there 's no danger to the people in town . Of course , it 's up to you guys if you want to stay or not . Then we 're staying . Mom . Aw , shucks ! We 're not going anywhere ? Futaba , take care of mom . Leave it to me ! But this is so strange . There 's this huge thing floating in the sky , but we 're talking so normally . Oh . I have to go Kyoko , Hajime , Futaba ... I 'll be contacting you again . " I 'll be contacting you again . " It 's like a soap opera ! He 's so cool ! Mom , how much do you know about dad 's work ? That 's what I 'd like to ask . How much do you know about what 's happening , Hajime ? Jeez , the men of this household don 't tell you anything about that sort of stuff ! What ? Dad hasn 't told you anything about the Galactic Federation or the aliens ? I don 't know anything about it . I had an idea that you guys were hiding something , but ... But ... I trust you two , so ... Let 's have breakfast ! It 's so rare that we 're all up so early . What ? She said she trusts you ! Shut up ! It 's not gonna happen ... I 'm telling you it 's useless . It 's a waste of battery power ! Plus , it looks like it 's not going anywhere . But besides that , what 's with this town ? Say what you like , but this is too laid back ! Not really . The parts that are calm are the shopping district , the station area , and that street area we were at . It 's only the old parts of town . The residential area on the east side is filled with cars trying to evacuate . The local police have their hands full trying to direct traffic over there . Maybe the reason this thing is here has something to do with this area 's calmness ? Anyway , we 'd better think of a coverage plan for later . I made rice porridge for breakfast . It 's an easy-on-the-stomach menu . Enjoy ! The Yamato porridge looks delicious . Let 's eat , shall we ? You 're not going to ask any questions about it ? " lt " meaning the spaceship ? We thought about explaining it ahead of time , but I figured we would argue like we always do at the meetings , so I decided against it . So , it was you two that were involved in this matter after all ? I figured we wouldn 't be able to resolve anything by only taking the cautious route . What are you planning to do ? Basically , Judgement Day has come . On this day today , the Galactic Federation and Earth will be announcing their intentions of unity , both at home and abroad . The universe is one ! Earth is our friend ! We 're all friends ! Stop joking around ! We , the people of Tenmo , will stand as witnesses of this treaty . What did you say ? We 've already settled it with the person handling this matter at the government and the Galactic Federation . Cabinet Secretary lto should be settling the matter with the United Nations , so all that 's left ... Is for me to agree ? Yes . This is outrageous ! Aliens opposing the Galactic Federation are coming now ! This is no longer on the level where the Shingu can keep defeating them at the water 's edge ! But it 's not clearly decided that the Galactic Federation is good and the opposition forces are evil . Do you understand ? Very much , I do . I feel guilty , but I have pulled a little stunt in secrecy also . A little ? A little ? A little ? Stunt ? Grandpa 's pickles are good . Aren 't they ? If you want , I could bring more next time . I 'll bring a barrel full ! They 're here . What was that ? What 's wrong ? Record of the School Wars : MURYOU Say what ? Another ship has appeared above the ocean ? Hey ! It 's moving ! W ... What 's happening ? Mr. Yoshida ! What 's happening , Mr. Yoshida ? A spaceship ... Another spaceship has appeared ! It 's enormous ! This is also an enormous ship ! Ahh ! How to describe it ? It 's slowly headed this way ! Mom , what 's going to happen ? It 's all right . Didn 't dad say so ? What 's wrong , Hajime ? The school ! That 's ... Is that the " stunt " you pulled ? Yes , it is . Whose ship is that ? Is it ... ? It 's a different planetary group than the Galactic Federation . What ? With a certain someone 's help , I was able to invite them here . " Certain someone " ? It couldn 't be ... ? Now that I look at it , it 's really big isn 't it ? Both ships span about almost six kilometers . At this rate it 's going to take a while for the laundry to dry . One is the Galactic Federation 's ship , and the other is ... Who does the other spaceship belong to ? Let 's see ... I guess you could call them the Cosmos Alliance . Cosmos Alliance ? That 's right . They are the enemies of our Galactic Federation ! They 're our rival ! I think it may have been a little before I introduced your planet , Planet Zaigle , to the Galactic Federation but the Cosmos Alliance and the Galactic Federation got into sort of a quarrel . A quarrel ? Jiltosh ! Hey ! Long time no see ! Come down ! I need to talk to you . I hear you took off from school for a while . Did you go somewhere ? I went to headquarters on business . Oh , good work then . There were some things that I wanted to investigate . Okay . Okay . That commotion out there ... It was you , wasn 't it ? Which " commotion " are you referring to ? The anti-Galactic Federation force ... About bringing the Cosmos Alliance 's spaceship here . Oh , that one . I did that because the Madame at the Sanemori house asked me to . Lady Momoe asked you ? " A discussion just between Earth and the Galactic Federation ... " " ... will only cause problems in the future . " " We must invite all parties that are involved . " We 're not allowed to observe what happens ? You guys stay on standby . Why ? We 're the Chosen ! This is Lady Momoe 's order . We 're the ones who 've fought up until now and we 're not allowed to witness what happens ? To be blunt , yes . Adults are so unfair . Listen . It may be a discussion , but who knows what might happen . If something happens to us ... I understand . Huh ? W ... What ? This is the security key to the school . Have a study hall session by yourselves . Study hall ? And study what ? Study whatever . I 'm giving you permission . They 're coming ! You 're ... ! The white-belt helper . We made itjust in time . Hello . Hi you two . Welcome , everyone . Thank you for this opportunity . Pleased to meet you . I 've come to represent the Cosmos Alliance . Is your name , Kanata Myouken ? That name will be fine . School will be temporarily closed today . Misumaru Middle School Morning ! Hey , Muryou . What are you doing here ? That 's what I 'd like to ask you . It 's just ... I couldn 't bring myself to sit still . You do get a great view from here . Yeah . So , how do you feel after seeing that ? I don 't know . My father seems to be involved with it somehow and I 'm only a middle schooler ... but ... But ? You came here in May . Then , that day when I saw you and Kyoichi fight right here ... At the time , I didn 't know what was going on but I thought I had to witness it ! Witness it ? Witness what ? Umm ... I don 't know . That 's why I thought I had to witness it . I know that doesn 't make any sense , but I 'm sure Toshio would say I 'm being an active onlooker or something . Hey ! You guys ! Morning ! You came to school willingly ? Yup . We got permission from Mr. Yamamoto and he gave us the security key . In other words , the school is ours for today . I see . But that doesn 't mean we 'll allow any illegal activities ! Illegal ? Meaning it 'll be like any other day . But I only came to see the spaceships so I really didn 't " come to school " . It 's more like ... You snuck in ! That 's exactly right ! Stop joking around ! Are you going home ? Hmm ... Let 's see ... I saw the spaceships , so I 'm done doing what I came here for ... Hachiyou ! Good work , but there was no need to rush . No , not that ! It 's an emergency ! What 's wrong ? Everyone 's ... Everyone 's coming to school ! What did you just ... ? What 's going on ? Maybe they came here to look at the spaceships ? That 's ridiculous ! Harumi ! Kyoichi , good morning . What 's going on ? The school 's closed today ! You guys are here , though . Nevermind us ! Is this Mr. Yamamoto 's instructions ? No , this is an instruction I sent , as the leader of the Protectors . We will protect you . How cool - Harumi , no ! I don 't want to drag everyone in ! Everyone might be a Protector , but besides you no one is capable enough for battle ! Children have their own way of fighting . Then let 's make today an impromptu preparation day for the Cultural Festival . Hachiyou ? Okay ! Harumi , let 's iron out the details of the pamphlet and poster ! Come with me ! Yes . Kyoichi ! Stay with us , Murata . Make preparations for the Cultural Festival . It 's rare that we get to use the school without the watchful eyes of the teachers . Well ... That way , Nayuta will be happy . Hey , what 's that supposed to mean , Kyoichi ! ? You ... ! Nobody knows what 's going to happen . But , something is going to happen ... And we must do something ... I think everyone came to witness that ... Because this is our school . To be continued in the next episode . To be continued Next Episode I 'm Hajime Murata . Next Episode Everyone has come to school . Her , him and even him ... It doesn 't matter if you are a Tenmo native or a Protector . Because this is our school ... Because this is where our classmates gather . While the whole world is watching a provisional student assembly will take place .

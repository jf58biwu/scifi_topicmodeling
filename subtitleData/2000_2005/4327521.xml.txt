 Another glorious day to be alive . Rise and shine , Pickles , my love . - You a cop ? - No . - Am I in detox ? - No . Then it 's all gravy . God , she 's cute . - You do it . - No , you do it . - You . - You . What in tarnation 's going on in here ? - lt 's Chip 's turn to wash the middle cheek . - l washed it yesterday . - Did not . - Did so . Boys , personal hygiene isn 't a chore . It 's a privilege . It 's what separates our great nation from dirty , smelly places like France and the public library . Thank your lucky stars you have soap and running water and an extra buttock to scrub . - Gee , Pop , I never thought of it that way . - Hey , back off. I get to scrub it . - The hell you do . - Yes , I do . - No way . - Come on . - No . - You 're always scrubbing . Morning , sugar . Want some OJ ? - That 's Mommy 's juice . - Hey , squirt . That Nordic Track was the best investment I ever made . Oh , you are one toned hunk of man meat . That darned cat . - Where 's Milo ? - Milo said he 's not going to school . Beth , honey , nobody likes a tattletale . I do . They 're an essential part of any family . You keep right on tattling , sweetie pie . Daddy has a magazine with naked ladies hugging . Oh , criminy . Milo , what the heck ? Hi , Dad . Just thought I 'd get some sawing in before breakfast . Son , you know you 're forbidden to handle anything sharper than a boiled egg . - Now , come on . You 'll miss the bus . - Good. I hate that stupid little bus . Why do I have to go to a school for psychos ? Whoa , Nellie . It 's not a school for psychos . It 's a school for the pathologically high-spirited . Now pack up your books and your muzzle , and let 's go . I can 't wait to get to school and resume learning . I can 't wait till you drown in your own saliva . Drowning is my third favorite way to die , but they are all good . Hey , I found my mom 's car keys in my butt flaps . I wish I was normal like you guys , then I could go to normal school . Milo , news flash . All schools suck . Yours is no worse than anyplace else . Hey , Milo , you ready to do some book learning ? God hates me . Okay , children , coloring time is almost over . - How are we doing , Milo ? - l have to poo . Not until potty time . You may control my mind , but you 'll never control my ass . Looks like somebody needs a night-night nugget . - ls it Friday yet ? - Nope . Thank God it 's Monday . is it me , or does the poison taste different today ? Oblong ! What the hell 's with all these medical claims you 've filed ? - Well-- - Four hundred dollars for liver x-rays ? - Pickles drank some homemade vermouth- - - A complete lower Gl series ? - Biff and Chip 's colon is working for two . - Three trips to the podiatrist ? I had to get an insole made for my underwear . To prevent fanny corns . Maybe you valley people wouldn 't have so many health problems if you didn 't live where the air is contaminated and the land befouled . Well , sir , we can 't really afford to live in the hills like you . Well , the gravy train is over , my friend . File one more medical claim , and you 're off the company plan . - What ? - And you 're getting saliva in the rat powder . Use the suction . Everyone , I have an important family matter to discuss . - Crap. ls this another intervention ? - No , sugar . I was informed at work that if we file any more claims , we 'll lose our health coverage . - We have to be very careful from now on . - Well , I 'm not quitting wrestling . Great . Last year I got a ruptured disk , and I 'm not even on the team . - You calling me a homo ? - What ? - You are. I heard it from that mouth . - No , I 'm not . Boys , this is serious . Without insurance , we can 't pay our doctor bills , not to mention Milo 's school . I know. I 'll switch to regular school . I 'm cured of all my problems . You really think so ? What about your attention deficit disorder ? Milo ? I was so close to going to regular school . Like me , your only crime is enthusiasm . - You just ate a squirrel . - Did not . - Hey , I wanna go to normal school . - Hypothesis : Suppose you get sick . Outcome : Your dad will file a medical claim . Result : They 'll cancel his insurance . Unintended consequence : You go to school with us . I don 't know how to get sick , but I could get injured . How much does it cost to reattach a limb ? Doesn 't seem like the kind of thing your dad would splurge on . Yeah . Besides , I don 't think I could really injure myself . Hello . What am I , invisible ? I 'll arrange an accident , and you 'll never see it coming . - Your armpit is really wet . - Oh , yeah , this is gonna be sweet . I quit. injure your own damn self . Please , Helga. no one else in my family 's gonna get hurt . - Oh , God . Tree . - Tree . Your mother does beautiful work . Dr. Morris , dial 1 1 8 , please . Dr. Morris- - - Doctor , how are my boys ? - l 'm not gonna sugarcoat it . They 're a mess. I can 't tell where one starts and the other ends . You do know they 're conjoined twins . Oh , then it 's not as bad as I thought , but it 's still pretty bad , at least for Chip . He has a broken , well , pretty much everything . There goes our insurance . Milo , I 'm afraid you 'll have to quit Granville and go to public school . Yes ! Normal school . Normal school . I get to go to normal school . Hey , I 'm feeling better already . I think I 'll jog home . Wow , normal school . Allow me to explain the social hierarchy here at Hill Valley . There 's the rich , cool kids from the hills , then come the jocks then you 've got your dorks , geeks and dweebs those wild dogs on the soccer field , the boy who lactates and then there 's us . Hey , don 't lump me in with you losers . I am accepted by all social groups . Hi , Debbie . Hi , Debbie . Hi , Debbie . Bye , Debbie . Bye , Debbie . Bye , Debbie . - Who are they ? - The Debbies . They 're my close , personal friends . We 're all beautiful and popular . Who is that angel ? That 's Yvette . She 's just a stupid Debbie . Don 't even try to talk to her . Love is a joke with no punch line . I don 't know what 's happening to me , Mikey . When I 'm near her , my heart races , my palms sweat and for some reason my underpants get tighter . I don 't fit into underpants . I wear my grandmother 's old bra . I don 't care if she is a Debbie . I 'm gonna talk to her . Well , if it isn 't the new kid , Obdong . We don 't like you valley geeks sniffing around our women . Stay away from Yvette , or we 'll beat you crapless . Comprende ? Everything but " comprende " . If you don 't know what- - Screw it . Push him down . So how 's our money situation ? If we can get the kids to eat packing peanuts , everything will be okay . We just have to pray no one gets sick . - Don 't worry. lt 's just a fur ball . - Thank God . Nope , sorry , I think it 's a lung . Guess I 'll have to find a second job . Mom , I have a problem . I think I 'm in love . Oh , sweetie , your first love . My little boy 's growing up . - Mom , you smell like beer nuts . - l know . The problem is the girl I love is from the hills . Oh , boy . Well , my advice is to follow your heart . When I was young , you know , I lived in the hills . Then I met your father , and we fell in love and moved down here to the valley . And you know what ? All my hair fell out , and I started drinking . - Please tell me there 's more . - Of course , silly . I found a great bar right next to a wig store and I get to wake up every morning next to the sweetest man in the world . I wanna follow my heart , but Yvette 's friends won 't let me anywhere near her . You let Mommy handle that . - Hello , Pristine . - Pickles . Fabulous to see you . Love your hair . Where did you buy it ? Off some whore . I think it was your mother . Well , gotta run . I don 't want my daughter and her friends exposed to a drunken hose-bag . Oh , my gosh . Did I say that out loud ? Oh , my God . Look , a novelty license plate that says " Debbie . " It 's showtime . Hi , Yvette . Mommy . Wow , you got a B-plus in math . I knew you were different . You wanna sit on the love seat ? A little game of doctor ? Don 't mind if I do . Hey , isn 't that my- - ? - Hi , pumpkin . How goes the job hunt ? - Lousy . Poor baby . - Hey , are you a hooker or just a slut ? - Why you- - My husband won 't let anyone talk to me that way . No , indeed . Somebody needs to teach you some manners . I recommend Rules of Etiquette by Miss Amy Vanderbilt . Gee , Bob , why don 't we drop him off at the bookstore on the way home ? Sorry , honey , but without insurance , I can 't afford a severe beating like I used to . I 'm the owner , Anita Bidet . And you are one aerodynamic little peckerwood . How would you like a job ? You wanna pay me to be a human projectile ? - That 's right . - Done and done . Pickles , this is the answer to our prayers . We don 't like you big people horning in on our action . Look , buddy , my husband needs this job , and he 's not taking any crap from you . Oh , somebody get me a rope . I 'm gonna climb Mount Skanky . Now you 're in for it . Bob ! Sir , I have some recommended reading for you . You gotta admit , he does go far . Unbelievable . Thanks for a great time , Yvette . And the nipple ring . It 's a friendship tag . In case you migrate- - l mean , leave town . Hey , that kid 's imitating Fred Astaire . Get him . Stupid rednecks and little people . If I had medical coverage , I would 've mopped the floor with them . Sure , Bob. I understand . Hey , a cigar . Milo , what happened ? The hill kids beat me up because they saw me with Yvette . But I 'd take 1 000 beatings for her , long as they lay off my face . - That 's my meal ticket . - Kid , you 're a true romantic . An uninsured romantic . Milo , I 'm afraid I can 't allow you to see this girl again . - What ? - Next time those bullies could hurt you ... - ... and we can 't afford- - - l know , the medical bills . There are more important things than money , Bob . Like a little boy 's heart . If you wanna talk to me , I 'll be at the Rusty Bucket . I can 't go in there . You heard those dwarves . Your son is willing to risk everything for the woman he loves but I guess you 're not . Pickles ? Pickles ! I gotta let Yvette know how much I love her but I 'm not supposed to see her . Write her a love note . That always gets to us ladies . That 's a great idea . I 'll even deliver it for you . I happen to know she 's at a tea party with the Debbies . I 'm sure my invitation got lost in the mail . You live in a fantasy world , don 't you , Helga ? What was that ? I was thinking about my hundreds and hundreds of boyfriends . I smelt it . Hi , Mrs. Klimer . My name is Debbie . I 'm here to have tea with my friends , the Debbies . I 'm beautiful and popular . Well , then , come in , come in . - Hi , Debbie . - Hi , Debbie . - Hi , Debbie . - l love your dress . Your sweater is , like , the best thing I 've ever seen . - ls that for me ? - Excuse me. I 'm talking to my friends . So you like my hair , I like yours too . Love your new dresses . Cute shoes . Girls , I have teacakes . She 's not a Debbie . She 's one of those horrible valley kids . George , Jared , come quick . I warned Obdong to stay away from Yvette . Let 's burn down his stupid clubhouse . - Jared . - Yes , Dad ? Let me show you how to make a proper torch . First , you soak some rags in kerosene ... . - You really like this Yvette , huh ? - Yeah . She 's beautiful , funny . - She has MC Hammer frozen in a tube . - Sounds like quite a gal . But the best thing is the way I feel when I 'm with her ... - ... like there 's finally someplace I fit in . - Yeah , I never felt like I fit in either . Until I met your mom . I wish I was with her right now . Oh , insurance be damned . You go get your woman , and I 'm gonna go get mine . And I 'll tell you something else . I 'm standing in dog doodie . Hi . This is just a hologram . I 'm not home right now . Please call again . A hologram , eh ? You got pretty hair . Enjoy . Hey , hey , hey . Stop that . Get away . Get off me . Hey , you big ape . Let go of my sweet angel . Oh , Bob , my hero . We warned you not to come back , but you did anyway . You got guts , kid . As far as I 'm concerned , you 're one of us . As coroner , I 'll have no doubt You really knocked that redneck out Hill kids . They 're going to burn us alive . Technically , we will only be alive for the first half of the burning . Hey , weirdos , you 're all invited to a barbecue . Yours . Quick , ladies , to my house . I 've got a professional blow dryer . Let 's go , let 's go . - Yeah . - Yeah , Mikey . You saved the clubhouse . I have a problem . Yvette to mother ship . Bald nerd child presumed incinerated . Research incomplete . Returning to base . Negative . Not cost-effective . Terminate self . Oh , crap . Yvette . Why did you leave me ? It 's so tragic . She couldn 't live without you , so she vaporized herself . It must really suck to lose a girlfriend with a flying car . Yeah. I think I 'll just hang around for a while and poke my first love 's remains with a stick . I 'm hungry . - You okay , sweetie ? - l guess . When you love someone , they 'll always be with you in your heart . - Really ? - You betcha . Hey , when you get through poking at her , we 'll put Yvette on the rosebushes . She 'll make one heck of a fertilizer . Subtitles by : BloodLogic [ english ]

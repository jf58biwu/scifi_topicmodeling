 Previously on Farscape . Aeryn is with child . Aeryn , why didn 't you tell me ? Still obsessed , I see . She say anything to you before she left ? He 'll never bother you again . Is he dead ? - Yes , I think so . Say skernac . It 'll save you . Bury him . They have body armor ? - They 're shielded . That 's a hell of an invention . How come we don 't have that ? Ka D 'Argo , a received transmission awaits your review . We have an answering machine . Ka D 'Argo , Moya and I have received your signal . Here is our location . We look forward to your return . Pilot . By the yotz , Moya 's all right . She 's waiting for us . And now on Farscape . How much frelling longer ? If this is the right vector , where is your Leviathan ? Can you check the environmentals ? The air stinks in here . I have topher root if anyone 's hungry . Absolutely not . Fun traveling with kids , ain 't it ? There she is . Pilot , Moya looks beautiful . She thanks you , Ka D 'Argo . We are eager to have you back aboard . Not as eager as we are . Open up the bay . We 're coming in . Pilot , you and Moya okay ? We are well . - Pilot knows . Knows what happened . So shut up and let him tell us . Tell what ? Where the prang have you been ? We stopped at Arnessk , then searched for you at the Burial Grounds . Back it up a sec . Moya was sucked down a wormhole and spat out again . What happened in the middle ? My memory is unclear . We were not harmed merely examined . Nothing of importance . We await your arrival . How odd . He told me he remembered . Something 's very wrong . I mean , what if ? What if the people that examined Moya are still aboard ? Maybe it 's a trap . One sure way to find out . Walk straight into it . Okay . Weapons are primed . Right . I 'll take point . Everybody else stay put till I give the word . Aeryn . You 've come back . Everything 's gonna be all right . Everything ... is gonna be ... Baby , youâ   re burning up . I 've ... I 've got Heat Delirium . You have to promise me something . Promise you what ? You have to promise that you will not kill him . Won 't kill who ? He found me . He saved my life . Who saved your life ? Who ? I did . No ! You 're dead ! I saw you . You 're buried . You 're dead . What did you do to her ? I have put her in this coolant suit , to stabilize her fever . You 're weak . You must resume the full cooling treatment . You don 't tell her what to do . D , get out here ! No , he 's right , and he 's not a threat . He 's always a threat . No , lower your weapons . Scorpius , stand aside ! Aeryn . What 's he done to her ? I gave my word that he would not be harmed . Put your weapons down . And you expect us to honor that promise ? Yes , or I leave Moya now . What 's he doing here ? What does he want ? He wants asylum . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Asylum ? What is it with Peacekeepers ? First they hunt us , then they wanna move in ? Wh-what are we , a bed and breakfast ? We have a sign outside that says " Free HBO " ? Okay , space him . - Yes . No . - Let her rest . Allow her to return to the chamber , then we will talk . Chiana ... Aeryn needs help . You promise me that you will not harm him . You promise me . I promise . What did you do to her ? I saved her . Yes . She was alone , wounded , adrift in a Prowler . In an advanced state of Heat Delirium . Had I not found her ... How did you find her ? I was looking for all of you . Get it through your head , Scorpius . You will never get the wormhole tech from me . I could not use it even if I ... I merely want to safeguard it and hope , that when the inevitable Scarran bloodbath begins , you make the appropriate choices . Oh , so you 're here to be John 's protector . How nice . I don 't believe it . Kryptonite ... silver bullet ... Buffy ? What 's it gonna take to keep you in the grave ? Perhaps we should just take your head off . Worked for Durka . Good advice , John . So why hesitate ? You know what has to be done . Dammit , Harvey , guns are dangerous , man and hey , no smokin ' in my head ! It 'd be foolish to let him live . I need to know what his plan is . Same as always . Surviv ... To steal what is in here . So why give him a chance ? What would you have me do ? Whack him straight away ? Without hesitation . Ah , Scorpius . Your room 's prepared and we 've relocated your possessions . How many coolant rods do you need ? Rygel , cut it out . Aeryn needs those . Perhaps we should save them all for Aeryn . Would have arranged for a fruit basket , but we didn 't know you were coming . You play nice with the other kids , all right ? You know what to do . Watch him at all times . Pilot of Moya , these consoles need repairs . Where are the DRDs ? Busy elsewhere . Have we been introduced ? I am Sikozu Charnu . Command function is our first priority . Send DRDs immediately . Ignore her , Pilot . Hey , well that s a new record . You 've been on the ship for less than an arn and you 're trying to run it . Nice . Chiana , someone has to . That someone is not you . You 're cargo . Baggage . You think we forgot you were in the grave with Scorpius ? He 's alive . You said that he was dead . I thought he was . They buried him . And then what happened ? What , ya dig him up ? Hmm ? Did ya tell him to come here ? Hey , listen to me . Are you working with him ? Never should have let Aeryn go . I should have knocked her down and sat on her . John , it 's not your fault . I don 't know where Crichton is . Of course it 's my fault . I 'm really sorry . For what ? For everything . This is not how I pictured coming back . It 's just fate , as usual , keeping its bargain , and screwing us in the fine print . So , how 'd you catch this cold ? Dancing barefoot in the rain ? I can 't talk to you about that . Why not ? I really want to tell you . But I can 't . And we need to leave it at that . Okay . It 's cold in here . What kind of room is this ? Um ... something to do with regulating Moya 's temperature . Now how d you find it ? Scorpius did . 'Course he did . What else does he know that I don 't know ? Does he know how you got the flu ? Did he give it to you ? No . I had the symptoms before he found me . You don 't know that , Aeryn . This is Scorpius we 're talking about . He could have engineered the entire thing to get his ticket onto Moya . He didn 't . And I need you , I want you , to believe that . You make it very difficult . Everyone , there 's a ship approaching fast ! Well , Starburst now . - We can 't . Too much mass , too close . How can one ship be too much mass ... Reverse ! Get clear of it ! I 'm trying , but it 's moving with ... Pilot , can you hear me ? Outside signal . Overriding Comms . I am Ullom , Chief Protector of the Prime Lukythian . Addressing the Leviathan designated Moya and all her crew , including the assassin Aeryn Sun . I know she 's suffering from Heat Delirium because I induced it with a bio-engineered contagion . It 's genetically encrypted , making me the only one that can save her from the Living Death . Is he for real ? Aeryn ? My proposal is simple . Aeryn Sun gets this antidote when she gives me the names of her employers and her fellow assassins . I await your reply . Aeryn , you have to talk to me . I can 't . I gave my word . To who ? Scorpius ? He has nothing to do with Ullom . You know the kind of games he plays , Aeryn . He took advantage of a situation he could not have created . All right , fine . Forget about Scorpius . Let 's talk about Mr. Simple Proposal . He says you 're an assassin . I call him a lying son of a bitch . What do you say ? Aeryn , you have to give me something . I don 't care what you did . I don 't care about your promises . Just tell me this . He says he has the only cure . Do you believe him ? So , tell me . What am I supposed to say to the guy ? If you love me , you say nothing . Plan ? Yeah . You 're gonna talk Ullom into letting us aboard under a flag of truce . Then we take that flag of truce and hit him over the head with it . Mmm ... feeble plan . Give me half an arn with Aeryn and a tokkar knife and I 'll get those names . All right , your way first . The missile carries a pulse charge . On impact the pulse charge will destroy the biologics killing the Leviathan . And it doesn 't affect any of the life forms on board ? The passengers will be unaffected . Good . Very Good . Then why don 't we use it ? Not yet . She wants a Prowler to carry it . A projectile with this much mass belongs on a Marauder . A Marauder would be detected long before optimal targeting distance . Sir , only a Prowler can fly close enough for a guidance lock . With that aboard , no Prowler can fly steady enough to get a lock , sir . My simulations indicate that a skilled pilot could manage it . I 'm the best damn pilot there is . And I say you 're dead wrong . There 's no need to take rigid positions . Why not run another round of simulations and recheck stability . That should alleviate your concerns . What sort of leadership was that ? Ma 'am , this weapon is an unproven prototype . It needs study . I don 't want studies , Captain . I want Crichton . Knock , knock , knock . Candygram . Scan showed no weapons on your Pod nor your persons . Just as we agreed . Scans also show you aren 't ... Sebacean . You could have just asked . Do you want to see Aeryn Sun suffer the Living Death ? Well , if that 's the case . So , you 'll risk your lives for this antidote . Cute . Hologram . And we wanted a face-to-face . I don 't care what you want . I want the names of those who hired Sun . We have no idea . You played no part in her monstrous act ? Don 't even know what the monstrous act was . She and two others invaded our home world , and shot their way into the governing chambers and assassinated our most beloved Prime Lukythian . You know for a fact that it was her ? Before the killers escaped we managed to dose them with a contagion that induces Heat Delirium . Her illness should be all the proof you need . Something 's not right . It should be blue . Put it back and get a replacement . Some fyang powder will deepen her sleep . Crichton won 't mind . Is he still aboard the Lukythian ship ? Yeah , with D 'Argo . Been a long time . Maybe they 're making progress . Or maybe they 've been killed . You didn 't have to say that . Hmm . I hope this fyang 's still potent . Yes , it is . You . Out . I 'm analyzing ... - Now ! But I must know who hired them . My people are ready to go to war over this . You need to know who paid for the hit ? We don 't have a problem with that . We have a problem with that ? You might tell Sun that if she 'd cooperate , I 'd have no reason to hunt down the other assassins . Ullom , I know what you 're doing and you should know by now that I will not play . Everyone , Aeryn 's up on The Command ... Aeryn , get back to the cold room now . Pilot , send the DRDs . - Youâ   re dealing with me . Threatening my friends is not going to help you . So , send them home , and let Moya go . I am breaking this stalemate . Goodbye , John . Pilot ! Somebody stop her ! You said she 'd cooperate . I said maybe . After a suicide attempt ? I 've been too patient . My soldiers could easily board your ship . Go ahead ! Bring ' em on . You know damn well what 'll happen . Aeryn will never allow you to take her alive . And I need her more than you do . So back off and we 'll get your names . May I talk to you ? Please do . Flissok taka ! Stasis command ? You speak Pilot ? It should not even have worked . They 're very badly programmed . Vakla norrok vez plokon ? Krejna Skarn za ? Za . Prejor Arnessk ... vech plakato brixa skelt ? Your death would serve me no purpose , but your life might . So far it has not . I could not even prevent your burial and yet here , they blame me for your presence . How did you survive ? Foresight and preparation . Why did you come here ? To safeguard John Crichton , amongst other things . You do realize that this is a damaged Leviathan , with a fraudulent Pilot and a crew of idiots , do you not ? They need help . They are more resourceful than you realize . Don 't be so upset . Death is nothing to fear . I should know . Why won 't you allow her to die ? Soon enough , you 'll wish you had . I 'll get the antidote , end of story . Oh , that 's my Johnny . Still in denial . Do you remember what I said to you once ? Before the Living Death takes hold , you have to be prepared to kill me . Promise . Not a chance . Why won 't you just let her go ? She 's not yours . Point of fact , I never was . Never will be . But you 'll never be lonely . Whether I 'm ... here ... or here ... or in a grave on Arnessk or a cell on Moya , you 'll never be rid of me . You have no right to do this . It 's my life . And what if other people depend on you ? Ullom doesn 't care about anyone else . He just wants me . Not as much as I do . I made a promise . Doesn 't that mean anything to you ? Doesn 't life mean anything to you ? When did you become an assassin ? When I found a cause that required it . So tell me about it . Tell me the Prime Lukythian is the devil incarnate . Tell me you did the universe a favor . Tell me why the saints you 're protecting need anonymity . Tell me it 's worth you dying . It is . Marauder recons have detected a Leviathan which might be Moya . Any recommendations ? Ponara ? Sir . Is this missile operational ? Absolutely , sir . Then I recommend we use it . Ready the Prowler . I 'll fly it myself . You , sir ? - You 're convinced this mission will fail . You 're obviously the wrong person for the job . Dismissed . Dismissed ! Good hunting , Captain . No , John . John , you gotta stay away from Scorpius ! Just gonna to pick his brain . Yeah , that 's what he wants . A chance to lie to you . You gotta stay away ! Harvey , cut it out . Don 't you ever do that again . That 's it . Now , tell Crichton ... So ... that 's how you survived . She was on your team all along . Untrue . She has just begun to help . How ? By sticking another chip in my head ? Quite the reverse . This device will take the neural clone from your mind . What clone ? John , Officer Sun is in danger , and so is Moya . I can help . Simply clear your mind and I will help . No . Consider this . I saved Officer Sun 's life while the clone killed her . Don 't listen to him , John ! No John , that is not necessary . I 'll get back into the dumpster . That 's not good enough . Come sit . What ? This is a private place , Harv . You don 't belong here . I 've been your ally , John . And your friend . It 's time for you to go . Take this . Please . - How could I leave ? - Your mind is full of so many wondrous memories . Cool jazz piano , chocolate ice cream , women 's perfume . Women . How could you take that from me ? You 're not real . I 'm real to you . I 'm real to myself . Sit . Goodbye then , John . I 'll miss you . Jennok provadag ! Without hesitation . He 's gone . Harvey 's gone . Now ... help . What can you do for us ? Information . In less than three arns , the Prowler will fire a missile and Moya will be killed . If you don 't trust me now , then we 're all as good as dead . And there 's no way for us to stop this Peacekeeper super torpedo ? Once it 's locked on , it can ride Moya 's slipstream through Starburst . So we should Starburst right now . Although I know we will not . No . Not while there 's a chance of getting a cure for Aeryn . There may be a chance . Sikozu has a theory about the Lukythian ship . Anomalies in its mass readings have convinced me it 's a chameleon . A projection . I buy that . Those guys are big on holograms . So how big is the actual ship ? Tiny . Crew of four or five at most . That 's better odds . John , I volunteer ... - No . No . And no . And no arguments . You have great difficulty trusting people don 't you ? You 're staying here . You 're coming with me . We may need a nerd . John , I 've learned that we have exactly one and 8 / 10 arns before the Prowler 's in range . How did you learn that ? I have a spy aboard the Command Carrier . And she wonders why I have trouble trusting people . Well , if it 's any consolation , I think you 've had a lot worse plans . Not by much . Pip , everything okay there ? Scorpius hasn 't moved one flot . Good . Pilot , get me Ullom on the horn . Done . Ullom . Aeryn gave up . She 's ready to talk . About time . You should ... - Ullom . Listen . She 's ready to talk because the Heat Delirium 's worse . We could lose her . We 're coming in now . Captain Braca , diagnostics verify the missile 's fully operational . If it delivers on its promise , Ponara , you 've got a medal . Keep moving . She 's losing consciousness . All right . Let 's do it . Come on . What are you waiting for ? I can get you the names , but you gotta save her . Now ! Come on , do it ! That 's not enough . Hit her again . One dose is more than sufficient . She should soon recover enough to speak . He 's still faking it ! - What 's the point ? - This place is sealed . You 're trapped and outnumbered . Yeah ? You got any more warm bodies , trot ' em on out . Or get your own ass down here if you got the nads for it . Any luck ? It is completely sealed off . There is no way out . - That 's right . - I control the ship . I can cut off your oxygen , or let you starve . Come on , Ullom . Come out . Stop fighting your battles with contagions and holograms and face me . Or are you a coward , Ullom ? I faced you once , murderer . You do not remember ? You shot me and left me for dead . You killed so many that day . I remember . But your leader had more people slaughtered in one day than I could possibly kill in a lifetime . And if asked to do what I did , I would do it again and again . And I would do it for free . I wasn 't hired to kill them . I ... My life support . What did you say this was ? - It 's a Tarkan body shield . - It 's the best part of the plan . Well , it worked . Yeah , it 's a first , isn 't it ? I think this is a Control Orb , a direct neural interface . God , I hate those . He runs the entire ship with this . No . You run the entire ship with that . No . No , I 've never ... Yes , you do . I will try . Oh , it 's ... it 's amazing ! I ... I see every ... every system . - You know what ? - I 'm really happy for you . Can you get us out ? ! I have to learn the ship . Find the hatch controls . Pilot , how we doing for time ? If Scorpius is correct , you 're already too late . You won 't get back before the missile is fired . Got it . Hatch open . I 'll take Aeryn to the Pod . - Right . You stay here . Wha ... ? Keep the motor running . - Okay . Pilot , patch me through to the prisoner . Scorpius , what does that missile lock onto ? A Leviathan bio-energy signature . Yes . It 's individual pulse , if you will . Is there any way to shutdown Moya 's pulse ? Only by a full biologic shutdown . Yes . - Moya could survive that for no more than 800 microts . That might be long enough . All right , here 's the deal . This is a chameleon ship . You 're a Leviathan expert . Create a decoy . A Leviathan 's bio-energy signature is very complicated . I will never get it ... - Just get as close as you can . All right . You should be coming into range any microt now . Missile reads armed and ready . I think it 's working . Beautiful . You 're still with us , Holly ? Not for long . Life support destroyed . You have finished what Aeryn Sun began . - John , get aboard . - We 're out of time . Pilot 's ready . All right , Sputnik . Now or never . Right . Coming into targeting range . Scanning for Moya . Now . Come on , come on ... Do it . Ah ! They did it . Now , Pilot . I must have a system malfunction . I 'm reading two Leviathans . No . No , Captain . No malfunction . Marauder recon 's reading the same thing . Analyze the data . Which one 's Moya ? Uh , we 're checking . Vaklo enpya rossok wiklo , Moya . That 's it . Lock it off . Captain , one of the Leviathans is dead . It has no energy readings at all . It must be a decoy . You sure ? Positive , sir . Transmitting proper coordinates now . Received . Acquiring target . Here 's your rematch , Crichton . Missile has been fired . It is now irrevocably locked to the counterfeit signature . Pilot , resuscitate Moya now . Initiating resuscitation . You can do it , Pilot . - Come on , baby . - Give us a heartbeat . It 's not working . Moya have been dormant too long . You can awaken her . You will ! Come on . Come on . I told you you could do it , Pilot . You 're the draddest . You 're very kind to say so . Okay , we 're in . Go . Detonation . Wait . Readings have changed . The dead Leviathan 's moving . The dead decoy just went into Starburst ! It ... it 's not possible . I ... I had the correct target . I 'm sure of it . You 're relieved of duty immediately . Report to detention block three . - I 'll handle the postmortem , Captain . Report to the Aurora Chamber . Just take a seat . I 'll be with you shortly . Congratulations . You made it through the day without being shoved out the airlock . Of course , this day is not quite over . I have two questions . One . Did you do anything at all to Aeryn ? No . I have not harmed her , in any way . Two . On the Command Carrier , you said you knew where Earth was . Is that true ? Do you ? I do . Anyone else ? No . No one . I purged all records . The knowledge exists in here . You can use it to get home , or you can safely eradicate it , by killing me . Again , the choice is yours . It is so , so good to see you and Moya again . You know , it ... it kind of feels like coming home . We 're equally happy to see everyone . With the exception of the newest arrival . I now miss Jool more than ever . Hey , listen . If Sikozu ever speaks to you like that again , if she ever gives you any lip , you just drop her in the bat dren , okay ? Nobody ... nobody should talk to you like that . Nobody should tell you what to do . Yet , everybody does . In fact , Moya and I have made a decision . You want us gone ? Ah , not at all . But we cannot serve so many masters at once . We ask you to choose one spokesperson . You mean , just pick a captain ? Yes . A single voice for us to follow . I 'll tell the others . We 'll ... we 'll take a vote or something , okay ? Hi . Hey . What are you looking at ? Nothing in particular . I 'd like to stay . Well , I 'm sure Moya would be very happy with that . I need to recover . Is there any other reason ? I need to help you keep an eye on Scorpius . I 'm not gonna hurt him . I gave you my word . I know . I want to be here . Is that a problem ? Any other ... oaths of silence I should know about ? So , you could tell me ... you were pregnant .

 IMC SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH CENTRE , USA Dr. Cameron , all units ready . Activate energy mode , level one . Yes , Sir . Proceed to test one . Now we 'll demonstrate RS1 's basic weapons system . Show time . No need for alarm . The temperature threshold of this glass is 3000 degrees . - Proceed to test two . - Yes , Sir . Dr. Cameron , what is this ? These two balls are filled with a highly volatile explosive . RS1 has figured out that if he hits them , he will be destroyed . RS1 has dexterity as well as power . Congratulations . What do you expect ? Thank you . Dr. Cameron . That was just amazing ! Now I know where all my money went . Well , if you haven 't paid for us to try , we wouldn 't have had the chance to succeed . Say , where 's that bright young Chinese fellow , that computer whiz ? - What was his name ? - It doesn 't matter now . He 's bright enough , but he lacked discipline . Oh , too bad . Anyway , here 's to RS1 ! Cheers ! Get down ! Steve , abort the programme ! Someone 's hacked into the main frame ! - Cut the power ! - Yes ! Will you tell me what just happened here ? How are we meant to take that thing to Hong Kong ? The weapons exhibition is just one week away ! There is nothing wrong with RS1 itself . Someone hacked into the system . We can seal the breach , but I think we 'd better not go to Hong Kong . And risk our government funding ? I 've invested millions in this project ! You just make sure that RS1 is hacker proof . We 'll let the FBI take care of the physical security . No problem here . Whoever did this knows way too much . Whatever happens , we 'll handle it . Mission accomplished . We 've helped you find your baby . Now , you help us find a fortune . Right , and next stop ... Hong Kong . HONG KONG Is it a done deal ? OK ... OK , bye .

The International Military Technology Exhibition is to be held in HK It will consist of the latest and most powerful weapons ... including the American attack robot RS1 Security teams from every nation will escort their exhibits to HK An FBI unit will bring RS1 from the USA You know her ? Intimately Really ? Your team assignments and your individual duties are listed on the notice-board outside ... Understand ? Yes , Sir ! Thank you , Sir . Well ... She must have stayed undercover at the Playboy Club for too long No , I 'd say she was undercover at Penthouse She doesn 't have the character of a Playboy Club girl I 'm very excited , because it 's my pleasure to introduce to you Officer Wah of the Technology Development Division ! Yeah , go , Wah , go ! Officer Wah ... Show time ! Sorry ... I 'd like to introduce you to a robot that took a long time to design He 's called D1010 Hello ! My name is D1010 Don 't mistake him for a vacuum cleaner This is D1010 He 's a sophisticated robot who can handle any crisis Name the crisis , he can handle it For example , a robbery at the race-course , a riot ... Stupid rubbish bin ... or even an explosion at a nuclear plant . It can meet any challenge . And , even predict the winning lottery numbers . Let 's start with a simple demonstration . He can defuse a bomb . Come on ! This is a bomb . Thanks a lot . You 're welcome . Green Cannot be cut . This just proves how capable D1010 is ! It was my fault because I didn 't listen to his instructions clearly . It also proves D1010 communicates in English , because the grammar is back-to-front . It also proves ... Oli Match ! I thought you didn 't recognize me Why not ? We had such a great time that night Especially after I took you home Only because you 're so skillful ! Really I 'm so happy you feel you can talk about sex so openly but show some respect for my feelings , okay ? I haven 't tried a `one night stand ' yet You pervert ! But you said you 'd ... Played video games at her home ! What 's wrong with that ? This is my partner Al ... You know my name ? Of course ! One of my friends has such a crush on you Everyone in the computer section knows your name . Really ? - Who could be so brave ? - Peggy - Pretty Peggy ? - Here she comes Nice to meet you ! At last you 've met your dream man ! Happy ? What 's so funny ? Don 't be shy . I 'm sure you two will hit it off Let 's go for a drink this Sunday - OK ... - No way ! I 've just been assigned a new case and I 'll be busy for the next two years , so just forget about me Alien ... Good ! Give me more energy ! Don 't stop ! Let 's get funky ! ... Higher ! Don 't stop ! Welcome our visitors ! ... Be proud ! We 're the Hong Kong Police Force ! Smile ! Match , smile ! Wave those flags ! Is she nuts ? Waving flags ? Hey , man . No work hard cannot get world money . Keep it up ! Don 't stop ! Welcome ! Yes ! Yes ! FBI ... Give me your F ! Give me your B ! Give me your l ! FBI ! Sorry Chief Tucker . Welcome to Hong Kong ! What 's going on ? I 'm ... so sorry . It 's been a very long day , they 've been waiting all ... It 's OK , guys Nice shot Thank you ! Good shot ! Man ! Very good ! Madam , we 're trained officers We 're used to handling big cases OK , you want to handle some big cases ? Look over there Bellboy ? ! The exhibits at the International Military Technology Exhibition ... include some of the most advanced weapons from around the world We 've arranged a special preview for you senior officers This is the German smart-gun ... with its self-aiming helmet This is an amazing product ... with many different applications Its intelligent turbo aiming system Once you wear it you can shoot the balls off a fly from five hundred metres This way , please This is the French robot , codenamed Jerry L It employs both a British stealth system ... and Russian smart software We haven 't quite figured out how these can be combined Now I 'm going to introduce to you ... the most perfect crime-fighting machine ever Please come this way If we 're talking high-tech you may find it hard to believe ... that this invention is made in Hong Kong : its the intelligent robot D1010 . He can handle any crisis He 's my invention , so , of course , he looks a bit like me . D1010 is equipped to handle any situation . For example , a robbery at the race-course ... Sorry , lady , this is not a trash can . These two gentlemen are senior engineers from China 's Special Research Enterprise . Doctor Tang Chin Chun and Doctor Lai Shun Fung Doctor , may I ask what is the main purpose of your robot ? I tell you its main purpose is ... The One-Armed Boxer ! Made ln China ! Right . Listen up everybody . These are DNA ID passes . I 've stored all the DNA information of all security personnel on these cards . To enter , swipe . If the machine recognizes your DNA , you 'll be let in . If not , the alarm will sound , like this . Like this . Surprise , surprise . It doesn 't work . You know , all right ! My first guess is they put this job up for grabs and offered a cut-rate deal to the lowest bidder . You think ? You see that bullet-proof glass out there ? One sneeze from a fat guy and it 'd shatter . This lab is built according to the blueprints that your agency sent us , so what is the problem ? I guess the problem is that we didn 't have it translated . No , no , you don 't understand . I assure you this place is the state of the art . For Hong Kong , maybe . I mean , what else is wrong ? The walls aren 't thick enough , the lighting isn 't bright enough , there isn 't enough power . This is not a Teletubby we 're keeping in here . I thought you American experts are controlling the robot . What 's there to worry about ? Did anyone ask for your input ? Alright , everybody just stay calm . Let 's focus on the job at hand . I 'll have a crew fix the lighting and power problems . Jane , get some of the tech boys on the DNA machine . Quincy , see what you can about getting the glass replaced Sure Agent Tucker I really hoped we could cooperate on this because the US zone is our responsibility . Of course . We appreciate the effort , I 'm sure there 's something you can do for us . Of course Isn 't that right , Agent Curtis ? Yeah , definitely . Get me some coffee , black . How about you guys ? Mocca , please . Latte . Irish coffee , Latte , donut an egg tart will do ? OK guys , I need you to do something for me . Can you get me two Cappuccino ? ... and three Irish coffee ... four Cafe latte One donut , and ... One lemon tea We 're policemen If I have to do this kind of thing , I 'd rather go work at McDonald 's Come on , Match Madam , I once worked at a snack bar . I will do my best ! Thank you That 's my boy . Quick ! My God , man ! Where have you been ? Alright , alright . I got a couple of things to handle , Pick a spot and call me back in ten . OK ? Alright , bye . Three without sugar , three without milk Four without sugar or milk Done That American wants you to hurry up If they make me work as waiter , I 'm gonna resign How can I look people in the eye ? I don 't know what kind of boss that bitch is Who the hell sent us to this division ? Kurt What 's up , dog ! Where are you ? Jumbo . What do you mean , I don 't know where the Jumbo is , man ? Are you on crack ? Yeah , I 'll be there in an hour , okay . Alright ... later , bye . I 'm outta here , guys Jumbo , I 'll be there . Jumbo . With sugar , with milk , no sugar and no milk . - Cheers ! - Cheers ! Comrade , your Tung Fung robot is so `square ' . How can it compete with the American RS1 ? Please ... enlighten him . That American robot is no match . Our Tung Fung is designed to combat them ! One strike and they 'll lose . We 've waited years for this chance . We 've waited , and now ... Now what ? Young comrade , this is a national secret . Where are you going ? The next draw numbers in the lottery are 92 , 73 , 48 ... - What are you doing ? - Repair . - Why don 't you send it to the Urban Council ? / / - Why ? Then it can be used as a real trash can Are you crazy ? Sorry ... It 's only a game . What 's up ? My man ! Kurt ! What are you doing here ? Just here to visit an old friend . What else ? Five whole years , man ? What 's the deal , man ? OK , I surrender . What do you want ? Look at this shit . Still the same old Kurt ! Still can 't handle losing . Goddamn ! What 's up with the hair ? Shit ! What the hell was he thinking ? Don 't play , Kurt . You know what happened to him . Yeah , he killed himself . What really happened to him ? He was clean . He was a good cop . Some assholes kept some money from a bust , and somebody had to take the rap for it . and unfortunately , it was Steve . He left you hanging , huh ? Leave it alone , Kurt . OK . I just never thought you 'd become a cop , that 's all . Me , neither , man . Me , neither . But enough about me . How 're you ? How 's your family ? Family ? No more family . Just me , the main man , sitting here , Looking out for number one . Well , hey , anyways , I heard you got into that high tech design shit . Man , you must be making millions , balling baby ! The cash was good . It was pretty sweet for a while . But ... the better you build it , the faster they gonna steal it ! Dope ! Can I keep it ? Hey , so you 're saying someone stole your design , huh ? Right ! Same person I come down here to terminate . Well , hey , if you need a cap peeled or a body buried . I 'm your man . For real ? For real . Well shake on it , then , my boy . Oh yeah ! Knew I had to come back to Hong Kong , this is where my real friends are . Oh yeah Where my real friends are . Alright . Yo , get off me ! Hey , man . Where are you going ? Playing it cool ? Everything is going according to plan . We 'll be done in 5 minutes . What the hell 's he doing ? All units , code red ! I repeat , code red ! - Kurt ? - It 's pay back time . What the ... Oh my god ! Yeah ! Bingo ! Edison , you are the man . Bye bye , Doctor . The robot 's gone ! The target is here ! Aim ! Prepare to fire ! Don 't fire ! Are you going to take the blame if the robot gets hit ? Does anyone here know exactly how its designed ? Report activities of target Target here , currently inactive , over Sir , no one here knows to control the robot . What shall we do ? The robot 's moving ! Fire ! Fire ! ( French ) Freeze ! You are under arrest . Bullshit ! Goddamn ! - Police ! - Freeze ! Stop ! Stay back ! - Are you crazy ? - Stay back ! FBI ! Freeze ! This is not my fault ! You have no way out ! Drop the gun ! And let your men shoot me ? They won 't shoot unless you force them to shoot . Don 't shoot , man ! You shoot , I shoot ! Edison , just tell us what 's happening . Why did you kill Quincy ? What ? You killed an FBI agent ? Are you crazy ? I don 't know what 's going on with me ! I can 't remember ! Enough bullshit ! Drop the gun and give yourself up . Edison , come in here ! Let 's go ! Move it , man ! Hurry up ! Move ... You bastard ! Where the hell are you running to ? Where are they going , you son-of-a-bitch ? Gentlemen , we need some answers and we need some answers now . Yeah ! Listen to me . The robot is mine , I designed it . And they stole it . We 're just making things right , right now . Yeah , but did you have to kill all those people back there ? I am only going after Cameron . Whoever gets into the cross fire . It 's not my fault . Those were real people , Kurt ! Two hundred million dollars , Edison . What are you gonna do ? Turn me in now ? Come on , give it a rest ! Get real ! No , you get real ! There 's still time . You can turn yourself in now . What are you ? Insane ! Jesus ! They want you dead ! If we go back now , both of us will be finished . Enough of this bullshit ! Let 's finish this clean ! It 's not your call right now , Mike . Back off , Mike ! It 's not your call ! Son-of-a-bitch ! Goddamn ! Hey , buddy , is this the best room you 've got ? Right , this is the best one What time do you serve dinner ? We 'll let you know Match , what do we do now ? What can we do ? No need to call for a lawyer We 're innocent Right , just let them fight it out ... and it 's even better if they arrest Edison Of course I 'm just upset I can 't get on my ICQ Upset ? Treat it like a holiday and you 'll feel better I 've never even been down here before It 's not so bad Yeah The robot is mine , I designed it . And they stole it ! You 're one of the FBI . What are you doing ? Nothing personal . Your buddy 's orders . Just leave me alone , OK ? I can 't . I still have to take you in . What 's wrong with you ? You already know I 'm being framed . I don 't know anything Except that you 're involved . Fine . Believe what you want . I don 't have time for this bullshit . What I believe doesn 't matter . They 're still going to come after you . If you 're innocent , you 'll turn yourself in . This is Hong Kong , my town , my turf , my business . I 'm not going back until I take down Kurt . Hey , take off or take a bullet . Your call . You think I won 't ? I already shot one FBI today . I can shoot another . OK You can go after Kurt , but I 'm coming with you . That 's my job Your security would be a joke , except the punch line was that we lost one of our best men . Agent Curtis , our police force is one of the most disciplined in the world . This was just an isolated incident . That `isolated incident cost Agent Quincy his life . It left dozens of other people wounded or dead , and our agent is missing . All that matters now is that we find RS1 . Losing the robot is not an option . Superintendent Gao , I respectfully request that you allow me to put my own team on the case . Impossible . This is Hong Kong . It is outside your jurisdiction . I 'm sorry , but our State Department already conferred with your Chief Executive 's office . Gentleman , it 's a done deal . He 's just an old fool He 's always been a fool Are you the highest ranking officer here ? Yes . OK . Then I 'm talking to you . I expect full cooperation , including a space for a command centre and access to your computer system . From here , we 'll hard target the suspect . All the Hong Kong police need to do is stay out of our way , and we 'll have this thing wrapped by sundown . Excuse me . Sir , you saw the tape , right ? OK , well . Match and Alien ... They 're just kids . There 's no need to hold them , right ? No problem here . The FBI 's main focus is to reclaim the robot . Thank you Just find a way to get to this Edison guy . Right now , he 's the only lead we have to RS1 and RS1 is all this game 's about . Now we can give this stuff back to you These are your personal effects `Cyber business , Match Fung , Director' You 're a director now ? What are you doing ? `My left eye falls in love with your right eye Give that back ! Ching wanted me to read it It 's my ICQ lover Listen , guys We 've gone over the security videos I know what happened ... Madam , you needn 't say any more I 'll resign tomorrow Wait , I haven 't finished I want you to leave your passports with us What ? You are our main suspects now . If they can 't find RS1 and Edison ... then you 'll take the blame ! Are you kidding ? It 's a little early for dinner , don 't you think ? I 'm looking for a man-sized lobster . A man-sized lobster ... OK . Did you hit your head on something when we dove into the water ? Hello Hello , missing person ! Remember , 5 pm tomorrow , All their bosses will be there . If you don 't show up , we 're screwed . Our jobs are on the line , got it ? Yes 'Kimura , haven 't seen you on the ICQ for a few days 'My days have turned cloudy 'Miss you ... miss you ... ' The weather is fine today , yeah ? Can you be quiet ? You 're polluting the atmosphere This is my true love You know where Edison is ? You forgot what he said last time ? Ah , Jumbo , I 'll be there Lobster is expensive today $ 36 a tael , that 's $ 480 a catty but Australian lobsters are a bit cheaper . No , mister ... I want to find the guy who wears the lobster suit . Lymon ! That bastard must have screwed up again . That 's his boat . Go and teach him a lesson ! All right , so I get it . This lobster thing is a person . Is that him ? Drink ... You drink first , I 'll follow , OK . No , don 't force me to drink . Take it easy . Let 's drink together . Get up ! OK ... Who were those guys that night ? Make him drink ... he must drink . Get up ! OK , I 'll drink , OK ... Hey , man ! You managed to fool the FBI , wise-guy . Now you come back with us . I have to find Kurt first I can 't go back with you ' til I do . Alien , if you ever steal a robot and kill someone . ... and get caught , remember to say ... You can only arrest me after I take a shopping trip to Japan , or a massage in Thailand ... and go on an European tour . Got it ? You think we 're nuts ? Just come back and explain ! Wait a minute Edison told me he was hypnotized ... which means somebody used him to activate the robot . What did she say ? Bullshit If you don 't believe me , then here 's a witness . A mermaid ? Freeze ! No ! Help ! - You 're all right ? - I 'm fine . Sir , something 's up , we have to go ! - Where is he ? - Can you see him ? Get him ! Ian , no , we need him alive ! Lymon , you 're so much trouble . You keep on dropping me in the shit . - You bastard . - OK , cut the crap . I 'll send you some salted fish . Thanks . You 're welcome . You saved me , and I saved you . Now we 're even . Where 's the guy who rented your boat last night ? Man , I thought they just wanted my boat for a party . I didn 't know they wanted to abuse you . I don 't think you can go back there . Those guys are FBI . You 'd better help me out . You want to go on the run again ? You wanna take on the FBI ? Why ? It 's really not my fault , man . Ah-fat introduced those foreigners to me . He works in the Hop Hing warehouse , that 's all I know . I was just out to make a few bucks . Hop Hing warehouse . Thanks . My car 's over there . Take it , I don 't need it . It 's a stolen car , be careful ! Damn ! I knew green was my unlucky color ! Don 't you know how to steer a boat ? Did you have to crash into me ? That Edison is too much trouble ! But the FBI are the real bad guys ! Trouble-makers ! Hey , I didn 't mean you ! Sorry , man . Come on , you want to step outside ! You bastard ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Yeah ? Aren 't you in enough trouble already , assholes ? Us ! You guys broke laws that we don 't even have yet . Yeah , keep flapping , dickhead . You 're the one going to the bamboo Alcatraz . Oh , for what ? Illegal diving ? Refusing to bleed ? Thank god you Americans can 't shoot for shit . Yeah , let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Hey , cool down ! Stop it ! That 's enough ! Let 's get some order here right now ! This is a hospital . You should know better . Laugh while you can , gentleman . What did you say ? You two , come out ! We 've got you for abetting and aiding a fugitive . He was your partner . If we lose him and the robot , it 's down to you two guys . Roseanne Barr Arnold will be President of the United States of America before you two punks see the light of day . So you really don 't know where Edison is ? Edison ? What about our own people ? You had injured agents in the water back there , Ian ! They weren 't the priority . They weren 't your priority , and they should have been . What is it with you and Edison ? What are you talking about ? We have video tape of him stealing the robot and killing Quincy . Maybe it 's not what it seems . No . What it seems is that you need to get your mind back on this mission which is to take this guy down , hard . You 're so convinced it 's him . Why ? Why won 't you think of any other possibilities ? What possibilities ? You don 't have anything ! No evidence No witnesses Nothing . Just some half-assed conspiracy theory based on the fact that a guy you think is cute couldn 't possibly be crooked . That 's not where I 'm coming from ! You need to put your head on straight , Jane . Alright , otherwise you 're on the next plane home . No one 's going anywhere . Not until we see this thing through . Jane , are you alright ? Good . Then we don 't need to waste any more time here . So , we go home now ? Damn you ! We 'll be screwed like porn stars if this isn 't solved soon . What matters now is to finding some clue to locate Edison . A clue ? I wonder if this could be something . I picked it up at the Convention Centre . It 's Edison 's . He dropped it . This must be a vital clue . Why didn 't you tell me earlier ? What do you want ? We want to know the location of the guy who owns this e-mail address . Can you do it ? We do this kind of thing every day . As soon as he logs on to the internet then we can find him . It 's just like tracing a hacker . Peggy is our expert , she 's the best . If she helps us , you 're home free . Especially if it 's for you , Alien . If you ask her , she 'll definitely help . How can you talk like that at a time like this ? Look at that if you don 't believe me . She lent it to me . How come she 's got my photo when she didn 't go to that barbeque ? I sold it to her . Betraying your friends is a sign of the times . I don 't mind that you sold it to her , but where 's my cut ? I 'll split it with you if you persuade her to help . But I already have a steady girlfriend and she loves me very much . An ICQ girlfriend ? You 've never even met her . You swine ! How much ? Hi Still working ? Even when I 'm off-duty , no one dates me . It 's good that you 're free . Can you help me locate this guy ? Easy ! Sit closer . I 'm not blind , I can see the screen from here . Take it back , then . Close enough . We 're ordering takeout , Peggy . What do you want ? I want whatever Alien has . Alien , what do you want ? Pork Chop Bun , no drink . Pork Chop Bun , good taste ! It 's easy enough to sell one 's body . Just bear with it ... `Eyes ... Don 't fall in love with my long hair It 's his new book . You 've read it too ? I read it a long time ago . I even recommended it to my ICQ friends . You use the ICQ ? I like using the phone and the ICQ to chat up guys . as that book also says `Women don 't rely on their eyes for love What 's your ICQ nickname ? Where the hell is Kurt ? He went upstairs to crash for a while . Well , he 'd better get his ass in gear . The buyer 's flying in tonight . We got two hours to finish this shit . What ! You 're sleeping ? Get up ... Get outside ! I 've got it . It should be a warehouse in Tuen Mun . A warehouse ? Let 's go ! Thanks . What 's wrong with you people ? Move , you freaking blind or what ? I don 't understand . You told us to wait until it finished scanning . Someone 's hacked into my computer . Don 't start giving me shit , Kurt ! This is your mess ! I 'm calling the boss . Just exactly which word in the sentence you don 't understand , Vieri ? We 're being hacked Which means we can be traced . Which means we have to get out of here . Now ! Pack it up ! Pack it up ! Go ... I don 't know what the hell is going on . Somehow they traced it . Hurry up ! I don 't know . Kurt told me . Whatever , get it together . Did we score yet ? What 's wrong with you ? Drinking heals a broken heart . No problem . Hurry up . I am very god damn hot man . Let me go . I really ready to die . You know ? I don 't care if you die . Just let me make my meeting . Man ! Why is Peggy such a piggy ? You bastard ! Call madam My man , how come you got in here so early ? Seems to me I 'm right on time . Well , I had this weirdest dream ever , man ? You want to hear about it ? Give it up , Kurt . Dream time 's over . You know it was in this strange corridor . And I had two guns in my hands , and people were shooting at me . Shots just went off everywhere . It was just crazy , I 'm telling you . And it was so cool , you know why ? Cos not a single bullet ! Not a single one hit me ! Cos I 'm the superman ! And I was shooting and laughing And blowing the shit out of them . And there 're pieces of bone , and brain and the blood burst out . right onto the wall . Just look at that . What a pretty graffiti . And you ! And you just pop out of nowhere . You had this gun pointing right on my head . But I couldn 't shoot you . You know why ? Cos you 're my man . We used to back each other up , I 'll never forget that . This is no war game , Kurt . This is real life . Let me take you in now before it 's too late . It 's already too late . Come on , Edison ! You want to take a walk with me on the wild side ? You 're a wanted man now . Remember ? You know what , Kurt ? You 're really messed up , man . You want to know the real reason I couldn 't kill you in my dream ? I ran out of bullets , baby ! Hey ! You bastard ... Help ! Hey man ! I give you a drink , OK ? Don 't kill me please . You bastard ... Go to hell , you bastard ! - The robot ! - Jackpot ! How come some cops are so inefficient ? Forget it , we 've found the robot now You see . So danger . We 're home free Really ? Madam Chung said if we can 't find Edison - ... they 're going to blame us - No ... Madam Chung said if we can 't find the robot ... then they 're going to blame us . I don 't think so . What the hell ? Team B , target is located Report location . Target at the centre of the warehouse , over . Watch out ! Oh shit ! Where did your people get to ? I don 't know They never called in . Oh , no ? Should we take a body count while we wait ? It 's the second bloodbath they 've caused . I want some answers here . If it wasn 't for them , we 'd never have found that place . So what ? How do we know they weren 't just setting us up ? Whoever is setting this place up OK , is based in the States It 's obvious they were just using Edison to get to RS1 . - Is it ? - Yeah Wow , really ? Cos the only thing that 's obvious to me ... is how far you 'll bend the rules in order to avoid taking the rap . OK , listen . I don 't want to play the heavy , but we 're running out of options here . If RS1 gets taken out of Hong Kong , it 's the Bureau that 's going to take the heat .

 [ Doggett ] Looking right at us . Fifty bucks says that 's Lukesh . A hundred says he knows we 're here . It 's him . Let 's take him . Let him get to the mailbox . [ Doggett ] It 's Lukesh . I don 't need him opening the mailbox to prove it . Patience , Agent Doggett . We 've got an agent alone with a psycho ... who likes cutting out women 's tongues ... a guy known for his vanishing act . We 've got the block surrounded . He isn 't vanishing anywhere . And your partner volunteered . Now ... open 4-D . Agent Reyes ... [ Over Radio ] Stand by . What the hell is this ? Monica , don 't . [ Follmer ] Agent Reyes ... keep your distance . Don 't let him see you following . Monica , where are you ? [ Reyes ] Back stairwell . I lost sight of him . I think he might be here . [ Monica Screams ] Oh , no . Oh , no ! [ Groans ] Agent down ! Back stairwell . ! Get EMS here now . ! Doggett , he 's got her gun ! Erwin Lukesh ! Federal Agent ! Turn around , you son of a bitch . [ Siren Wailing ] Back here ! [ Garbled Radio Transmission ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] Hey . So this is how the uptown crowd lives , huh ? This is it . Moving on up . So , is there anything really heavy that I can move for you ? A dresser , a fridge ? No , but thank you , John . You 've just missed the movers . You don 't say . [ Chuckles ] I brought you a housewarming gift . [ Paper Bag Crinkling ] [ Sniffing ] Hot dogs ? Polish sausage ! It 's the best in the city . There 's a little stand a couple of blocks ... over on M Street . You 'll be able to walk to it . Wow . Try one . Mmm ! Like I 'm back in Gdansk . Let me get some plates . Plates ? For crying out loud . Who eats Polish sausage with plates ? [ Phone Ringing ] [ Beep ] Hello . Agent Reyes , it 's A.D. Skinner . Yes , sir . There 's no easy way to say this . I 'm sorry to do it over the phone . What is it ? It 's Doggett ... he 's been found ... in an alley off Dillon Park . He 's been shot . I 'm sorry . What did you say ? [ Skinner ] They 're taking him to Washington Memorial . Agent ? Sir , what you 're saying is ... Agent Reyes ? Agent Reyes . ! [ Elevator Bell Rings ] Excuse me . [ Follmer ] Monica . Brad ? Skinner called you too ? He 's staying at the crime scene . I 'm sorry . I 've been put in charge of the investigation . I promise you ... it 's my top priority . I will find the person who did this . I just need to find out ... why your partner was in that alley this morning . He wasn 't ! He was with me , at my apartment . He was with me when Skinner called me . I 'm not sure I 'm following . Monica , I 'm so sorry . Agent Doggett is just coming out of surgery . They 're moving him to the ICU . How 's it look ? If he pulls through this ... it 's likely that he 'll be paralyzed for life . I haven 't understood one single word I 've heard ... since I got here . Whoever you 're talking about , it 's notJohn Doggett . [ Instruments Beeping , Hissing ] You found the bullet . Nine-millimeter slug . Found it in the alley lodged in a wall . Most likely from a SIG Sauer P226 or 228 . Possibly FBl-issue . I know what you 're thinking ... but this didn 't come from Doggett 's weapon . Ballistics don 't match , and his gun was never fired . Assistant Director ? I 'd appreciate case updates in a timely fashion . For instance , this bullet ... How long have you had it ? An hour ? Two ? Thereabouts . It 's just that we need to keep the lines of communication open . That 's all I 'm asking , okay ? I want this slug run through ... our database of FBl-issue pistols . Like I told you ... the round didn 't come from Doggett 's weapon . You 're not saying another agent could have done this ? Just run it , please . I just ... I don 't understand how any of this is possible . He was with me , Dana , in my apartment . How can this be ? I saw something once . It 's only been the last of couple years ... that I 've fully come to terms with it . In ' 94 , my father passed away . And that night , I think ... that very moment that it happened , he came to me . I like to believe that he came to say good-bye . A visitation . I think that 's wonderful ... a blessing ... but that 's not what happened to me . [ Cell Phone Rings ] Scully . It 's me . Is Reyes with you ? Yes , she 's here . We 're both still at the hospital . I need you to bring her to the Sixth District Police Station . I 'm on my way there myself . What 's this about ? I 'll tell you when you get there . What 's going on ? Agent Reyes , would you mind stepping inside , please ? Hi , Monica . Have a seat . I wanted you and I ... to have a chance to talk alone ... to clear a few things up ... a few details of your story . My " story " ? [ Follmer ] Well , your assertion ... that you were with Agent Doggett when he was shot . What is this ? - Just wait . - Is that a true statement ? Yes . I mean ... no , I wasn 't with Agent Doggett ... when he was shot , but I was with him ... at the time A.D. Skinner called to tell me he 'd been shot . Look , Monica ... you know how I feel ... you know I 'm on your side ... but give me something here . Give me some mitigating reason ... for what you 're trying to cover up . I 'm going to put a stop to this . [ Reyes ] What are you saying to me , Brad ? Why are you saying these things ? [ Sighs ] We 've checked and rechecked the ballistics tests . The bullet that hit Doggett came from your gun . And furthermore ... we have an eyewitness ... one who 's placed you at the scene . Is that why I 'm here ... in this room , so you can make an I D ? Agent Reyes , I 'm going to have to ask you ... for your FBI identification and your gun . Who 's there ? Who 's back there ? We appreciate your cooperation , sir . Anything I can do to help . [ Respirator Hissing ] [ Door Opens ] Smart touch ... posting a guard ... to make sure I don 't finish the job . Do you really believe I did this ? No . But it doesn 't matter what I believe . You may still be arrested . So what are they waiting for ? Follmer 's case has a couple of potential holes . For starters , there 's the fact ... that when I called you ... you were at home ... 14 miles from the crime scene . Plus , there 's the condition of your gun . It hadn 't been fired . However , the bullet ... does match your gun ... perfectly . It doesn 't make any sense . None of it . What about the eyewitness ? What can you tell me about him ? You know we can 't discuss that . Look . Oh , my God . John ? Is he conscious ? I don 't know . It could just be a muscle spasm . It 's not uncommon with this type of spinal injury . No , it 's not a spasm . What is it ? It 's Morse code . What did he say ? " Lukesh . " What ? What does that mean ? [ Television Playing In Background ] [ Old Woman ] Who 's there ? Is somebody there ? Erwin , is that you ? Who else would it be , Mama ? I thought maybe robbers . I thought something terrible ... had happened to you . You were gone so long . I was gone two hours and six minutes . I 'm back at noon ... just like I told you . I was so scared . Could you bring me a glass of Clamato ... with two squirts of Texas Pete ... and two ice cubes ? Oh , God , I was all alone ... and I heard the knob rattle . Somebody was rattling the knob . It was the robbers . I just know it was . I don 't know how I got through it . I was so scared . [ Announcer On TV ] Like sands through the hourglass ... so are the Days of Our Lives . My show is on . Could you make me my hot sandwich ... so that I could eat my sandwich ... while I watch my show ? What kind of sandwich is it ? Potted meat . I don 't think I like that . Have I had it before ? Many times . You love it . I should be at the hospital . Scully will call if he regains consciousness . Either way , I should be there . Agent , you 're still under investigation . Not to mention I will be too ... if it 's ever found out that I showed you this . " Erwin Timothy Lukesh . " Have you ever seen him before ? " 1995 : Patient at the State Psychiatric Hospital ... " at Gaithersburg . " Diagnosed with a delusional disorder ... " anger subtype , which presented itself ... shortly after the suicide death of his father . " After four months ... he was deemed fit for release . He lives with his invalid mother ... in an apartment adjacent to the crime scene . What 's the story he 's telling ? That he heard a bang ... went downstairs to investigate ... and then he saw you exit the alley . This is the one person we know was in the vicinity ... at the time of the shooting . Why would Doggett say his name ? You think Lukesh shot Doggett ? What if Doggett was investigating Lukesh ? What if Lukesh is somehow behind all this ? [ Phone Rings ] - Skinner . - It 's Follmer . Do you recall our discussion where I asked you to keep me up to date ? I do . Really ? And yet it 's like we never even had it . I 'm at Washington Memorial . I 'm assuming you 're with our prime suspect . Bring her . She 's going to talk to Agent Doggett . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Oh , the gang 's all here . How is he ? Fully conscious . We set up a communication device ... designed for spinal injury victims . Speaking with him should be much easier . Just so we 're clear ... you 'll ask only the questions I want asked . You 're not to try to shade his testimony in any way . If you 're so concerned ... why let Reyes talk to him in the first place ? Because he says he won 't talk to anyone but you . He didn 't mention you two . John . Hey , there . That 's right . You 're alive . As if there were ever any doubt . Why am I alive ? Is that what you 're asking ? I 'm fine , John . Why wouldn 't I be ? Have him say who shot him . My throat wasn 't cut , John . What do you mean ? Wiggle your finger if you feel anything . Any sensation at all ? Pain ? Tingling ? Okay . That 's enough for today . We 'll see if you can do any better tomorrow . You kiss your mother with that mouth ? It 's coming along . It 's nowhere , basically . There 's so much that 's impossible to reconcile . You say I was on a stakeout with you . I say you were at my apartment bringing me ... John ... do you know a little stand on M Street ... supposed to be really good hot dogs ? John , what if we were both right ? What if you were at my apartment ... and I was on a stakeout with you ... at the exact same time ? What would it take for that to be true ? [ Tapping ] Except maybe we do . Maybe all of us do . You 've heard of the idea of a parallel universe ... one that 's identical , or nearly identical ... to our own ... one in which we all have a double . It 's theoretical physics , but ... what if it 's real ? You said yourself , Erwin Lukesh was known ... for his impossible escapes . You said that in the alley ... you looked away only for an instant ... and he was gone . Back here ! And then somehow he was behind you ... and he shot you . With my gun ... my gun that never left ... my possession that entire afternoon . What if Lukesh can pass freely ... from one parallel world to the other ? Like ... like he 's opening a door . And what if somehow you followed him through that door ... without even knowing it ? Maybe when you followed Lukesh into this world , my ... my Doggett got forced out . My Doggett would have called that crazy too ... but give me another theory that fits . I 'm kind of confused as to why I 'm back . I already told you everything I know . We just had a few little , uh ... inconsistencies ... that we needed to clear up . Sure . Dot the i 's , cross the t 's . Yeah , here 's an odd one for starters . We have an eyewitness that says you shot AgentJohn Doggett . Well , that 's surprising . I can 't imagine who would have said that . Agent Doggett . Yeah , he 's regained consciousness . He 's very chatty . Among other things , he says that ... you 're a murderer . That you enjoy killing women with a straight razor . And cutting out their tongues . Yeah . Wow . [ Chuckles ] What a corker . Mr. Lukesh ... would you consent to a GSR test ? GSR ? What is that ? It can reveal whether or not someone ... recently fired a gun . You wouldn 't mind indulging us , would you ? I don 't know . I think I 'd have to talk to my lawyer about that . Look . My heart goes out to your Agent Doggett ... but he 's confused . It 's clear to me ... that your female agent , Ms. Reyes , is responsible ... for this terrible tragedy . Is there someone who can corroborate your story ? No . What about your mother ? You live with your mother , right ? She was sleeping . She wouldn 't have heard anything . Huh . Well , still , maybe she can tell us something . Would she be willing to come down here and talk to us ? My mother 's in poor health . She gets confused easily . Oh , we can go to her . I won 't have you harassing her just because you 're afraid ... to admit that one of your people did this . Now , if you 're going to arrest me ... do it . Otherwise , I 'm going home . Say hi to Mama . Agent Reyes , right ? What 's the matter ? Cat got your tongue ? How do you do it ? You know what I 'm talking about , don 't you ? There 's this world ... and there 's the world where you live out your sick fantasies . When did it start ? Was it after your breakdown in ' 95 ? All that anger . It 's buttoned up so tight ... it had nowhere else to go . It had to get released . Not here ... but in a world just like this one . God , I enjoyed you . You bled just like a pig . Reyes ? You all right ? Mama , I 'm home . Mama , you want your Clamato ? Mama ? Have you been out of bed ? Mama ? You don 't tell me things , Erwin . I tell you things . You sneak out of the house all night . You leave me alone all by myself ... and then you think I don 't know . Well , I know . I know ... every time . What is it that you do , Erwin ... that you don 't tell me ? I don 't . I don 't do that . I don 't know what you mean . Why is that in my house ? I opened the drawer , and it gave me a heart attack . I don 't know how I even picked it up ... without it going off and killing me . I was so scared . [ Crying ] Mama . I don 't know how it got there . If you won 't tell me ... you can tell the FBI , that 's it . Yes , the FBI has left three messages . They want to talk to me . Can you imagine , Erwin ? Why would the FBI want to talk to me ? [ Tape Rewinding ] What are you doing ? Aren 't you even gonna listen ? Are you gonna talk to them ? Well , of course I am . It 's the FBI . Mama . Oh , don 't turn on the waterworks , mister . That 's not going to wash . I 'm the one who 's being lied to . Erwin ... what are you doing ? Erwin . What are you doing ? Erwin . ! [ Screaming ] Did not . Anyway , that 's what you get for hiring cheap help . Thinking about what ? How ? Bad joke . My theory is sound ? You don 't believe a word of it , John . Never in a million years would you believe . This has nothing to do with my theory . I would do anything for you . Anything but that . [ Cell Phone Rings ] Reyes . It 's Skinner . Are you okay ? Yes , sir , I 'm fine . I can 't say the same for Miriam Lukesh . What happened ? She 's dead . It 's the exact M.O. Doggett described . Most likely a straight razor was used . Lukesh killed his mother . Do you have any idea where he is ? None . But if everything I 've been hearing is true ... he 's not going to be easy to find . I think he 'll find us . [ Soft Clattering ] [ Scully ] Are you all right , Agent Reyes ? Just a little jumpy , I guess . It 's understandable . I don 't think you 're the only one . Try and take it easy , Monica . We got you covered coming and going . Anything happening out front ? No , you moved into a quiet neighborhood . It 's dead out there . I think I 'll check around once more . [ Muffled Scream ] You want to scream right now , don 't you ? - Lukesh . - Because of your friends outside ... parked in a van ... might as well say " fbi " in big huge letters . Do it . Try and scream out to them . They can 't hear you . Where 'd she go ? Monica , do you copy ? [ Skinner ] Reyes ? Agent Reyes , do you read me ? He 's in there . He 's gotta be . - It 's not possible . - Well , what if it is ? You want to stick around and find out ? You ruined everything , you bitch . You made me . You made me do it . - Lukesh , don 't ... - Shut up . Shut up . But you know what ? This time I get to bleed you slow . You all right ? Monica , you all right ? It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's over . [ Beeps ] [ Respirator Deflates , Stops ] [ Dial Tone ] Monica , forget about the plates , will ya ? What 's wrong ? Monica , what 's wrong ? I 'm good . I 'm good . [ Child ] I made this . !

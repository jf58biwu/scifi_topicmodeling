 ( Scully ) We live in a darkness of our own making , blind to a habitant world all but unseen by us . A world of beings travelling through time and space imaginable to us only as flights of fancy . Who are these beings we dare to imagine , but fear to accept ? What dark work goes on inside their impossible machines , cloaked from us by invisible forces ? If they know our secrets , why can 't we know theirs ? ( boy ) Stop it , please . No ! Stop it . Let me go . - Let me go . - ( man ) Let the boy go ! Let him go , Mulder ! Let him go , or I will be compelled to use my weapon . I don 't want to do that . I don 't want to shoot . Now , are you armed ? Come on , damn it . This isjust stupid . Don 't turn this into a movie . Just tell me if you 've got a gun . It 's too hot for this BS ! All right , then , lie down . Lie down on the ground . Keep your hands out . Lay down on your belly there . For crying out loud , what are you doing ? Agent Mulder , stay there ! He went over ! Over the edge ! Who ? Mulder . All right . I 'll talk to Scully . You guys head back to the school . Where is he ? Where 's Mulder ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? An agent said on the radio you saw him . I saw him back right off that cliff and I saw him fall right over there . - ( Skinner ) Then where is he ? - Gone . - Come on . He can 't be gone . - He can 't be , but he is . That cliff there ? He fell from there ? It 's impossible , a fall like that . A cop sees things . A man drops five stories , dusts his head off and goes back to work . An old lady gets shot in a restaurant , plucks the slug out of her egg foo yung . But even if Mulder survives this , what he does then is too much . You got your point of impact there , clear and identifiable . And a set of tracks here leading down to the wash . Look at these tracks . What do you see ? Mulder was running . - It wasn 't Mulder . - That 's the one thing I 'm sure of . It may have looked like Mulder , but it wasn 't Mulder . I told you I knew Mulder . OK , maybe I didn 't know him that well . But I know who was up there , and it was Fox Mulder . I 'm sure it did look like Mulder and you have every reason to believe it was him . But it was not Mulder . I told you that I 've seen things , things that I can 't explain . Well , I have seen what looks like a man transform into another man . What looks like a man , but who 's not a man ? - So what is he ? - You don 't wanna know . If he 's not a man , what the hell is he ? Don 't turn your back on me . I 'm asking you a legitimate question . He 's alien . - He 's a bounty hunter . - Looking to collect a bounty on ... ? On Gibson Praise ... because he 's part alien . He 's a human anomaly . This alien bounty hunter disguised himself as Mulder to come out here and grab the boy ? To take him back to his ship , where we believe Mulder is . You know , Agent Scully , you 're starting to remind me a lot of Agent Mulder yourself . Well , then , you explain it to me . If it 's true or possible that there 's someone like this out there , this bounty hunter , he could just become anyone . You , me , any damn one of us . I think that it is true . And possible . And wherever Mulder is right now ... he better damn well be smiling . ( woman ) Is this authorised ? ( vehicle approaching ) Right . They 're here . - Any sign of him , of Mulder ? - Not according to these people . We went through the school . - You 're better than this . - Sir ? He 's gotta be here somewhere . Let 's search the school again . ( cracking ) ( footsteps approaching ) Hello ? Sorry . I thought you were ... I thought they 'd cleared you out of here . Find something ? No . Let 's keep looking . - Administration building is clear . - Copy . Check it again . I want to know how Doggett got here . How did he even know where we were going ? I don 't know , but he 'll turn this place upside down looking for the wrong person . - What happened to Gibson Praise ? - Whatever happened to him , he 's long gone . Wherever he is , he 's three steps ahead of us . We 've got a pair of eyeballs on us . Start walking . I 'll be behind you . Can I talk to you for a minute ? You shouldn 't have come here . You shouldn 't have come . You 'll lead them to me . I 'm here to protect you , Gibson . I know you know that 's the truth . I know you know my thoughts . I know they took the man you work with - Mulder . And now they 've come to take me . The only reason they wanna take you , Gibson , is because you 're a special boy . They wanna take you because of what you are . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know that someone was following me . My friend Thea knows . She 's the only one at school I 've told . She says the FBI is looking for me , too . She 's afraid for me . She has a right to be afraid . We don 't know who to trust now . - I fell when I was running away . - You might have broken it . If they find me , they 'll take me . I know it . I 've always known it . I 'm gonna make you a splint , Gibson , OK ? I can set your leg , but I 'm gonna need a car to get you out of here . I 'm gonna come back for you . I promise . I 'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you . You said that to me once before . ( cellphone rings ) Yeah ? Deputy director for you . - This is John Doggett . - I 'm getting reports from Arizona ... - Yes , sir . - .. that you found Agent Mulder . Somebodyjumped the gun on that . I saw him , but I ... What do you mean you saw him ? What the hell is going on out there ? I 've got local SAR , a rolling ground cordon and an eye in the sky . We 're on top of it . How does the FBI find a man and then lose him in the middle of the desert ? Cos I 'd like to know . - Are you there ? - Yeah , I heard the question . I put you in charge out there . Now do the damn job ! This amuse you ? I amuse you ? No . Itjust made sense to me . How you found your way here , who led you to Gibson . - You think I was spying on you ? - No , but I think our new deputy director was . You 're being made a pawn in a rigged game . You painted me the picture . Now put it in a frame . All right . You got a good rep , Agent Doggett . You don 't compromise , you don 't quit . You 're a damned good FBI agent . Lot of guys put you in the director 's chair one day . Which is why you 've been set up to fail . No amount of rolling cordons or eyes in the sky will turn up Mulder . It 's just the wrong approach . It 's not a question of approach . It 's the only approach I got . The only way you 're gonna find Mulder is to give in to the truth . To listen to Scully . But even then , say you do find him , even then you lose . You put anything about aliens or UFOs or alien bounty hunters in your report , Kersh will ruin you . I 'm betting that was his plan . ls Agent Scully here ? Where 's Agent Scully ? I need someone who 's with Agent Scully to put her on a radio . Someone with Agent Scully . Anyone got a 20 on Agent Scully ? Is anyone out there with her ? - I 'm with Agent Scully . - Then who 's this ? Go for Agent Scully . What ? Give me the radio . - You 're with Scully ? - Across the room from her . From who ? From me ? Where ? - What room ? Where are you ? - Bunkhouse . We 're in the dorm . Tell him to hold her . Tell him not to let her out of his sight ! Hold Scully . We 're coming to you . Agent Scully ! ( choking ) Hey ! There she is ! Do you see her ? - Where did she go ? Did you see her ? - No . She ran right back here ! I saw her ! You saw her ! ( gasping ) Agent , can you breathe ? He thinks it was me . He thinks that I did this to him . How is that possible ? It 's someone in this room . Mulder ! ( siren ) Agent Scully ? Where are you going ? Agent Scully ! Get out of the car . Agent Scully ! - Who are you ? - Who am I ? - Drop it and turn around ! - No . Just do it ! I know how it works . Kill shot to the back of the neck . You 're pointing your weapon at a friend . Turn around , or I 'll assume that you 're not who you say you are . Scully , it 's me ! Skinner ! I can prove it . I know your secret . Who else knows it ? OK . Then tell me . You tell me . How do I know it 's you ? I don 't like pointing guns at pregnant women any more than I like them pointing guns at me . This has gone too far , Scully . No . That 's what 's wrong here . It hasn 't gone far enough . - I need those car keys . - And what are you gonna do ? Look , we are being hampered here by the FBI , by John Doggett , by doubt , by our own mistrust . Whatever it is , it is working as long as we let it . You told me Mulder wouldn 't allow it . Wouldn 't let me ruin my career over this . Over him . But what about you , Scully ? I mean , my God , you 've got even more at stake . I can 't take the chance that I 'm never gonna see him again . Mulder could just come walking out of the dark . We don 't know . Look , we 've got one last chance here waiting for us out there in the desert . Gibson Praise . It mayjust be who gets to him first . Get in the car . I 'll drive . Gibson ! He 's not down there . I told him to stay here . He was supposed to stay here . Gibson ! I found him . Gibson ? What are you doing out here ? Why didn 't you answer me , huh ? He 's here . I hear him . What are you talking about ? Mulder . He 's somewhere out there . He 's got a really bad fever . I think his leg might be infected . We gotta get you to the hospital . OK , buddy ? You 're so close now . OK . Put your arm around my neck . Watch your leg . - Agent Scully . - You take him to the hospital . What about you ? I got a boy here who needs emergency medical attention ! What ? Are you OK ? What 's wrong ? It 's OK , Gibson . Lie down . Lie down . Mulder ! Mulder ! Oh , my God . ( helicopter engine ) For someone who claims he 's not following me , you sure have a knack . - You 're where the action is . - Does that tell you I 'm crazy or I 'm right ? Wandering around in the desert in the dead of night , you call it . You say you want to find Mulder , but you won 't do what it takes . - You 're afraid I 'm right . - I 'm not afraid of anything . Except that Mulder 's got even you believing in this crap . You 've seen this " crap " for yourself now . How do you explain what took place today ? Let me ask you something hypothetically . If you were to find him out here , or this ship , or this alien bounty hunter , - what would you do then ? - I know what Agent Mulder would do . - He 'd do whatever it took . - You mean lie . Like you 've been lying to me . And flout orders like you 've done every step of the way . Is that what it takes ? Give a little , get a little ! You knew where the kid was and wouldn 't tell me . Why ? What kid ? I don 't see any kid . You 're lying to me again ! Assistant Director Skinner took him from here to the hospital . How do you know that ? There 's one thing I know for sure in this case , and that 's that Mulder is after this boy Gibson Praise . Why ? It beats me . But when he goes after that kid , my men will be waiting for him . Your men followed Assistant Director Skinner ? Where you going ? Agent Scully , where are you going ? Your men are at the hospital ? I got it controlled . Nobody goes in or out of that building . How do you know that they 're your men ? Scully ! Scully ! - Where 's the boy ? - Door at the end of the hall , with AD Skinner . Are you certain ? My agents have a visual on the window . The nurse has checked the boy every 20 minutes . Personnel is going about their business . We 're just waiting for Mulder . Every minute that you wait , that boy 's in danger . He 's exposed . No one 's getting past us , Agent Scully . No one 's gotten past us . You believe that , Agent Doggett ? If something tries to rip your throat out , I got you covered . AD Skinner . This is John Doggett ! What the hell is this ? What the hell 's going on ? There 's no one in that room . I 'm looking for a patient , a boy , 12 years old . He may still be in this building . The window doesn 't open . How 's a man and a boy get out of here , except by that door ? ( creaking ) Agent Scully . It 's OK . I 've got him . Gibson . How did you get here ? - How did you get him out of that room ? - We went up through the ceiling . I don 't know who to trust . Where is he ? He 's right here . They 're gonna find him . ( yells ) ( gunshot ) Agent Scully ! An agent needs help ! I said an agent needs help ! The best I can say is it 's lucky it all happened in a hospital . Very lucky , yes , sir . I assume the hazardous materials which caused this must have been medical . That has not yet been determined . So much here is undetermined . As remain the whereabouts of Mulder . But some of your " facts " ... like " a man falls from a cliff and disappears " , " an agent has his throat crushed by an assailant who vanishes into thin air . " This reads like potboiled science fiction . You mean it reads like an X-File . But that 's what you intended , wasn 't it , when you assigned me to the case ? I 'll ask the questions , John . You just give me some damn answers . Don 't come back until you do . My dad always said it 's not who wins or loses , it 's who takes the worst beating that counts . - Is that supposed to cheer me up ? - I thought so . But then I never did get to see your opponent . And you never will . You still don 't believe me . What I don 't believe is how long they 're keeping you here . It 's just some things they have to check out ... make sure of . I 've got some things I thought you 'd want checked out . AD Skinner is in stable condition , resting comfortably and awaiting diagnosis and further study . Ditto Agent Landau 's throat . Gibson Praise is now a ward of the state , but I asked for special protection , as I assumed you would yourself . - What are you doing here , Agent ? - Keeping you apprised of the case . That 's not yourjob . It is , actually . And officially . I 'm ... assigned now to the X-Files . Whatever you and I may differ on , I 'll find him , Agent Scully .

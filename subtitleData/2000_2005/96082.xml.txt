 After fifty years of bitter warfare the Eastern Federation has beaten Europa 's armies and taken control of the Eurasian continent . But pockets of resistance fighting the oppressive new regime , remain in Eurasian Zone Seven . The military mobilizes once again . Again , families must lose their sons . I 'm honored to present my findings to this forum of the Health Ministry . Gentlemen , as you know , we 've beaten Eurasia and brought it under control . But the speed of our victory mustn 't stop us looking within . Our nation 's health is in crisis . Radioactivity ... industrial waste ... chemical weapons have poisoned us . Environmental diseases are epidemic and a threat to our future . Genetic mutations are rampant . Beyond the reach of current medicine . Allow me to present my findings . These are " neo-cells " , the fruit of my years of study . I found them in the genome of a primitive ethnic group . They can be converted into any cell to regenerate human tissue . All of the internal organs , nerves , bone , skin , hair ... everything can be cultured and harvested at our convenience . Simply put . " spare parts " for the human machine . With no risk of tissue rejection the medical technology of our dreams is finally at hand . Can we use it now ? With funding , it 's a matter of time . Our clone work is years ahead of you ! It 's just a theory ! Father , must you listen further ? Yes , it 's theoretical but if I get funding and the facilities I need , we can save our people . Think of your children ... your parents ... and your wives . Luna ... When the war ends , let 's get married . Sure . Is this what we fought for ? Fifty years of struggle to end up too exhausted to rebuild our society ? I read your paper . " Human Regeneration Technology " A dream come true if it 's possible . It 's definitely possible . With more research , right ? Professor Azuma , those fools won 't recognize your work . In fact they daren 't . It 's taboo to suggest , our original genes need improving . Pardon me . I 'm Kaoru Naito of Nikko Hairal Inc . We 've already built a lab to host your research . How come ? The military 's taken an interest . General Kamijo ? The Defense Ministry is at your disposal . Sorry to hear your wife is unwell . What 're you getting at ? Work with us ... let all our dreams come true . Azuma Residence Azuma Residence Dr. Kozuki , move to the right . Dr. Kozuki , move to the right . That 's it . Maybe place a hand on your daughter 's shoulder ? Okay , that 's wonderful . Smile , please . Is your mind made up ? Yes . With your mother ill ? And what about Luna ? I can 't stay here while my friends are fighting . You hate being a doctor that much ? It 's my duty to my country . You 've no idea what war is like . It can 't be worse than cowardice . Darling ... Let 's not fight today ... Forget it , Mother . Go ahead , please . Luna , Congratulations on your engagement . Thank you . Kozuki , excuse me . My new lab opened last week . One Year Later Eurasia , Zone Seven Shoot , shoot ! Kill her . Do it or you 're next . Understand ? Midori ... Be patient . I 'm going to find a cure . Grenade ! Eastern Federation , Defense Ministry Eastern Federation , Defense Ministry Culture Lab . One moment , please . Dr. Kozuki is downstairs . Bring him up . Up here ? That 's right . Right away . Impressive security . Sorry for the sudden invite . Is Luna with you ? She 's in the lobby . Midori wanted to see you both . A nice idea after so long . She must get lonely . Has it been a year already ? Thanks to my son ... Luna must be suffering . Still no word ? Not to me , at least . He went to war to spite me . Sons always defy their fathers . He despises me . I put my work before family but can 't even cure my own wife . Isn 't the neo-cell treatment nearly ready ? It 's incredible what you 've done ... Usable ? No . Fixing wounded men with new organs ... makes my armor research redundant . It 's far from complete . And I 'm out of time . Is she that ill ? She 's almost blind . Still doing research , though ... There 's selective leaf decay and darkening overall . Poor nutrition , perhaps ? How about the others ? Here they are . Did you hear something ? No , I didn 't . I think someone just arrived . I 'm sorry . Would you go check ? Certainly . Mother . I 'm home . Can you find a cure ? Then , shouldn 't you be with her ? I mustn 't give up . Yes ? No ... Tetsuya . I 'm so glad you 're home safely . We must be thankful . Did you see Luna , yet ? I 'll see her soon . You must . She waited so long . I know ... I 'm so forgetful . They 're coming for dinner tonight . It 'll be such a surprise . Ikegami-san , Ikegami-san ! Professor ! What 's wrong ? My son ... he 's dead ... September 16th , Sergeant Azuma , made the final sacrifice , losing his life in duty for god and country . A most ... a most noble and heroic end . After posthumous promotion , he 'll be buried tomorrow . Tetsuya ! A state funeral with full military honors . You may view the body tonight . Please get ready . Luna ... I messed up ; now you 're alone . We had all the time in the world , so I took you for granted . I know it 's too late , now ... but I 'll never leave your side again . His body 's on the way here . The funeral 's tomorrow . Did you tell Midori ? She already knows . Warning Malfunction ! Pressure overload . Cause unknown ! Osmosis tank failure ! Shut down the vacuum feed . What 's going on ? What the hell 's that ? Culture fluid 's transforming . What the ... The neo-cells ... It 's the neo-cells . Organs are recombining . Professor , what 's going on ? What the ... ? What is it ? Code 206 , code 206 ! It 's me , Naito ! Get in here , now ! Professor , let 's go ! Open up ! We 're still in here ! They 're coming ... Go secure the overflow ! Hold up ! Set up an outside perimeter . Who said we take orders from you ? The whole project 's my responsibility . Grunts shut up and do as they 're told . All of you , outside ! Get me H.Q. Luna ... What happened ? Naito here . I 'm inbound . I 'll report when I get in . Mother ... Tetsuya ... They 're escaping by vehicle . With a hostage . Seal off Eurasian Zone Three . Where 's my wife ? Hold on , my dear . Azuma . What 's going on ? Are you out of your mind ? Your son is dead . I don 't want to come back . Please . Stop ! Give me a hand . How on earth can this be ? You can escape through that door . Look after Tetsuya . You mustn 't die . Hold on ! Don 't die . Don 't die . Dear God ... What have you done ? What ? Foreign agitators are still at large . Heavily contaminated with infection , please report their presence . Let 's see I.D. Please proceed . It seems they 're heading for Zone Seven . Kozuki Residence . This is the body armor I developed . It completely shields the soldier and lets him move like lightning . Tetsuya 's muscle is so over developed he may tear himself apart . We must contain the internal pressure . Sekiguchi ! Hold on ! Sekiguchi , don 't die ! Mother you so hated the war . Wondered when it would end ... How many would have to die ... If peace would ever come ... We live ! Against all odds , we survived . Did men recognize our right to life ? No . They murdered our brothers . As if they had the right to judge . As if they deserved such power . We have equal right to life . It can 't be rationed . Nor denied at birth . No way . Of course it can 't ! But man presumed to judge us . If they claim this right , then so can we ... We 'll have our revenge . We 'll build a kingdom here . Live our lives to the full and do what we must . Let us be called " Neo-Sapiens " We hereby vow to eliminate mankind . We are the Neo-Sapiens . Bow down before us . Are we ready for the next offensive ? Yes . Two divisions are standing by . Intelligence reports eleven scientists in the target area . Roboticians , nuclear physicists and an armor specialist . Perfect for our new factory . Is it ready ? Bring me those scientists . Let them contribute to our power . Forget it . Reports indicate military scientists being abducted to work in robot factories . Our military is strengthening defense of civilian installations . That 's as much as I can do . It 's not perfect but it 'll stop him bursting apart . Father ? Dr. Kozuki , armor specialist . He 's ours now . Puny human . Tetsuya ? My boy ... My boy ... Fate has something in store for you . It 's going to be tough . But ... There 's got be a reason for it . There must be ... You must seek out your destiny . Luna . I 'm sorry . Never look back . Father ! Tetsuya , get up . Come on . Tetsuya , wake up ! Where is she ? ! Who the hell are you ? Where is my mother ? ! You 're supposed to be dead . Tetsuya ... Stop . Stop ! Get lost ! Move ! Go away , freaks ! Are your " neo-cells " ready ? I can 't afford to wait . What use are you , if you can 't deliver ? No more excuses , Naito . As selfish as ever . All you think about is yourselves . How dare you ! Old farts saving their own skins . Even for the general 's son , this is unforgivable . Our nation faces the Neo-Sapien threat yet your only worry is your health ? That 's unforgivable . Son . You know this is treason ? Of course . The Eastern Federation is now mine . Sorry . The era of brain-dead idiots is over . Son ! Satisfied , now ? Commander Kamijo . Let me introduce Professor Azuma . Father of the Neo-Sapiens ? Why did you lie to him ? That 's strange . I thought you 'd be pleased . I didn 't create them . I don 't know how they came to life . It 's too late to claim ignorance . They grow stronger by the day . If we don 't find their weakness , learn how to fight them ... our own lives may be in danger . Keep up your research . In return , the army will find your wife . Stick to the story , old chap . Don 't rock the boat . Your time has come at last . Why must people always fight ? Who did this ? We 're hurt , so we hurt in turn ... We 're killed , so we kill in turn ... Endless repetition . I can see it . What must I do ? What can you see ? A vision ... of how it might 've been ... And now ... my own father killed ... What should I do ? What would be best ? Of peace ... Shall I get a gun and kill ? If it 'd taken away the pain . Should I fight , too ? Stop talking nonsense . But you fought ? It 's my duty . You wanted to go to war . You 've no idea what war is like ... You 've no idea what war is like . You 've no idea what war is like . Luna . Get out of here . What do you mean ? If you stay with me , You 'll end up dead . You want me on my own again ? Don 't leave me ! I 'm to be alone again ? Don 't leave me ! Luna , listen . You saw it too , right ? What humans do to others . I don 't care what form you take . You 're still human . You 're still kind . I 'm no longer human . But ... You 're all I 've got . Tetsuya . Luna ? You mustn 't die . Hold on ! Dear countrymen . I have sad news . Several days ago , my beloved father , was injured in a terrorist attack . Thankfully his life isn 't in danger but he can 't fulfill his normal duties . Yesterday , the cabinet appointed me to continue to work in his place . His name 's Flender . Doesn 't normally like strangers . It 's contamination . I can only do basic treatment . Sit down . It 's not much but take it all . We must build the ideal , the most humane society the world has ever seen . I hope we get it right this time . What were you doing out there ? The pollution 's so bad no-one risks it . Unless they 're on the run . What 's your name ? It 's Tetsuya . Tetsuya , huh ? I had a son your age . You saw the ruins ? There was a lot of killing ... And a lot of people are taken away and never returned . Practically nothing left . Doctor ... What now ? Don 't trust outsiders ! It 's dangerous . What is ? He may be a spy . That nonsense , again ... Tetsuya , once upon a time , we believed in " Casshern " , a guardian spirit . Maybe that 's why we lived in peace and prospered for many years . But one day that all changed . A border disputes with our neighbors . Some senseless fighting . Suspicion ruled our every move . We forgot how to trust people . Invaded our neighbors for " self-defense " . I guess Casshern gave up on us . Then we were invaded . Humans ? Humans again ? Let 's go . Stop ! Why attack these people ? Deserter ... why do you care ? The war should be over now . There are terrorists everywhere . These people aren 't terrorists . I don 't give a damn . I just follow orders . As you heard , I was once one of them . We robbed you of everything . Can you save my people ? Is that him ? You 're mine ... Who are you ? Luna ! Think you can escape ? Luna ! Open up ! Now ... I kill ... every single one of you . Flight 18 request permission to dock . Permission granted . Promise me one thing . If you win ... you 'll help these people . Fair enough . My name is Barashin . And mine is ... Casshern ! Our strong nation forged through pain inspires and protects . Long shall she remain . Then will come wisdom and deep , silent faith . May the dreams of our fathers flourish by our glad sacrifice . Rejoice in our duty . 'Tis all that need suffice . My dear countrymen , We are facing a great challenge ... That 's correct . Get ready as soon as you can . We fight Neo-Sapiens , we fight terrorists . Professor 's bringing new samples . Are my neo-cells ready , yet ? General ... You sacrifice sons , brothers ... your pain is beyond measure . Or maybe these things don 't even exist ? But I too , understand your pain . Many years ago ... My own mother was another victim . Taken by Zone Seven terrorists . She was tortured and then killed . I hated my father for not saving her . You 've no right to be alive ! Because of your kind ... My own family is dead . The tide of history brings pain . But it returns with wisdom . Murderer . Feel my pain . I didn 't fight it . I gave myself up to the pain . I became a better soldier , a better person . In the cause of honor and justice , for our great nation . Let us reconsider our true enemy and focus on victory . I see it now ... At last , I see it too . That 's what she meant . We must prepare for the struggle against this incredible evil and remember the dream of our new nation . It 's okay , now . Forget it . All forgiven . I hope ... you 're at peace now . Didn 't we win the war ? Why are our soldiers still dying ? Amid the rubble and the funerals ... the seeds have been sown of our final victory . Where might you be going ? It 's all over . I 'll decide that . Experiment on the Neo-Sapiens , you 're nearly there . Study the lightning ... Don 't forget our dream . What 's going on ? What are you doing ? A nice girl like you wouldn 't understand but for us commoners this is the only way we can be . Right , Professor ? There 's no going back . This is the place of my birth . I should call you " Father " . But my hatred is as deep as a child 's love . Even though it consumes me I can never set it free . Raised in hatred . Just like a human . And your other son ... Tetsuya , born of the gentle Midori . Today he 's reborn as my brother . Let 's hear the truth . If I can just ... get in here ... What a farce . Commander ... I didn 't know it was a trick . Let me just ... get in here ... If we get a second chance at life why live it to the full ? I 'll deal with you in a minute . Thank you . Tetsuya . Want to see your mother ? Mother ... She 's sleeping . What did you do to her ? What ? She 's just asleep ... In a place beyond pain . Beyond pain ? Yes . With no war , only harmony for all . My promise to her . Man 's never content with what he has . His existence results in countless deaths . Striving for the basics of life he condemns thousands to death . He fights in pursuit of peace . That 's the world man has built . I 'll destroy it and make a new one . A paradise . You kill others with the same dream . Did a single one of them listen to us ? Did anyone think to help us ? To listen to our plea for life ? Only Midori . The only one . You kidnapped her . No ! She helped us . I don 't believe you . What are you fighting for ? If you kill us , will it be over ? Will that bring peace and simplicity ? Can man live like that ? You , a freak yourself stop dreaming . If man doesn 't change , there 'll be no end . History and religion prove it . Can you tell between good and evil ? Join with me . Let 's make a new world . You 're my only ally . Don 't forget , you 're not human either . Commander . Son . You know why I 'm calling ... Up to your old tricks ... The coup d 'etat is over . It 's on the news . I 'm blaming you for the Neo-Sapiens . You and that professor . It 's over . There 's no going back . I don 't intend to go back . Certainly not to you . Mother ... Was I wrong ? I fought for good reasons . Just like he said ... I don 't know right from wrong . If you embrace hatred , your enemy does too . In this way ... nothing changes . Tetsuya ... Nobody is always right , and nobody is always wrong . The answer is co-existence . Don 't give up . End the fighting . I still don 't see it . What you say you saw . So I must still be alive ... If this is living ... What have you done ? What on earth ? We did nothing . I understand . But hatred just brings more hatred . My son , Tetsuya also lost his life in the war . I 'd be lying if I said it doesn 't hurt . But holding on to my hatred will not bring back my son . You can , too . Midori ... Forgive me ... Luna ... It 's the last time I leave you . Do what you must . Where 's my wife ? Target their H.Q. ! - But your son 's inside . - I don 't care . Fire ! Son , I too , did what I thought best for our nation . Prepare to fire again . Isn 't that enough ? They may be a new breed to you . But inside they 're human . I 'll tell you something . She 's not wrong . You are human . Eurasia , Zone Seven . Remnants of ethnic-cleansing . Azuma is not your father . His neo-cell research failed . We did discover though your people are our ancestors ... the " original humans " . That 's right . Hate to admit but Zone Seven is where civilization began . Naito brought you in to extract the neo-cells . But the research failed . Not enough bodies . Then we had the idea to make national policy fit medical needs . In other words you were carved up to help my father live longer . It 's like a bad joke . A crazy policy driven by the greed for long life . Your lofty theory is wrong . Destined to hate us because you are us . Without even knowing ! Silence . Don 't you dare compare us ! You vermin are our ancestors . Mutant trash I 'll tidy myself ! Murderer . Feel my pain . I don 't see anything . I don 't see it at all . Forgive me . Forgive me . Father ! Where are you going ? I 'm going home . To our house . Don 't worry , I won 't ask you to come . But your mother needs treatment . She 's dead . But you came back . Have you been blind to the suffering caused by my return ? Are you blaming me ? That 's not it ! It 's not about one person 's happiness . You don 't care if she dies . If you 'd ever loved someone then you 'd understand . Don 't get in the way of our happiness . What are you doing ? Give her to me . Now ! I won 't . Do you know what it is to love ? I 'll soon bring her back . Mother ... What the hell ... was the point of my life ? What the hell ... was the point of my rebirth ? Mother ... Tetsuya ... Run ... This isn 't really me ... I can 't help what I 'm doing ... I don 't want to hurt you ... I want to run away ... from the pain ... Forget everything ... Start all over ... I know . Let 's end the hatred here . I didn 't want to cause more pain but it came to this . You won 't be alone again . I 'll be with you always . Just us two from now on . At last I understand . We hurt others by our very existence . That 's just the way we live . We need to learn to forgive . Need to realize that existence is to be shared . We 're not just here to exist ; but to find the strength to co-exist . It may start from something small , it may even seem impossible . But we must start from somewhere . Hope our legacy .

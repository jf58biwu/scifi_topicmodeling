 I see something over there ! - There he is ! - After him ! He must be here he can 't have disappeared ! - Look through there ! - We 'll find him Captain . Hurry up ! Hurry up ! I want him now ! We 'll hunt him down he can 't hide forever . Marguerite ? Thank you , John . - Tea Malone ? - Please . - What are you writing ? - Nothing very exciting . Just trying to capture how calm this place can be , how ... serene in fact . With Challenger 's recent improvements almost as comfortable as home . Ah yes , a veritable island of calm ... surrounded by a sea of great excitement . And occasional waves of sheer terror . That 's what makes this moment of serenity all the more precious . Uninvited guests , we spoke too soon . Pterodactyls ? Malone . - Who 's there ? - Come out now . I 'll see if I can get a drop on it from the balcony . Tribune ! Sorry to drop in unannounced . At the dawn of the last century A band of explorers searched for a prehistoric world Driven by ambition Secret desires A thirst for adventure And seeking the ultimate story They are befriended by an untamed beauty Stranded in a strange and savage land Each day is a desperate search for a way out ... of the Lost World I hope I 'm not presuming on your hospitality ? Of course not , we were hoping someone would just drop in . As always Marguerite you 're too ... kind . - What do you want ? - I need your help . Of course you do . My life is in danger ! You 're my only hope . This is the clearing , on my signal you two ... make your way across the clearing . If Tribune 's here ... you 'll push him to us . Then we 'll finish him off . I am being hunted for sport , - can you believe it ? - Perfectly , - would you like me to explain ? - Why ? - It 's a long story . - We have all afternoon . Well , after our little adventure with the Plesiosaur ... I returned to the Capital , to find that the old emperor , my mentor , had died . Your mentor ? Isn 't he the one who banished you to these outer territories ? That would be one interpretation , yes . But the point is after he died his wife , his trophy wife , seized the throne . She 's the one who wants you killed ? Centuria , yes . She 's made me the target of the game . Whoever catches me , dead or alive , wins . Why didn 't she just kill you when she had the chance ? Because this way ... she can humiliate Tribune first . I can understand her fearing me as a political rival ... but to hunt me for sport ... that 's more than a lizard can bear . Well it 's nice to know you draw the line somewhere . You know , killing is in our nature . Pulling the wings off flies that 's a human pursuit . Oh yes of course it is . We don 't have time to quibble . The lizards will find the treehouse eventually . If you 've led those lizards here . Where are Challenger and Veronica ? They should be back by now . - Are you all right ? - As soon as I get my breath back . Oh that was close . If they ever show up here those lizards ... are bound to be bad tempered . Boosting the power to the electric fence should slow them down . Very impressive . - Why are we helping Tribune ? - Good question . If my experience is anything to go by Centuria deserves her revenge . Are you two saying we should throw him out to be hunted like a fox ? This isn 't our fight . Think again Malone , it is now . Hello up there ! Send out Tribune ! Glad you could throw them off the trail Tribune . Give us the lizard ! We know you don 't want him . Tribune 's not here ! Try and get around that you slugs ! Can 't you keep your big mouth shut ? - Nice shot Marguerite . - Take that reptile ! Shut it . We 're going to need more ammo . You call that a game ? We take our games very seriously . Nothing like the imminent possibility of death to focus the mind . Well we could just wait and ... maybe it will leave through boredom or hunger . No telling how long that 'll take . So stupid getting separated from my rifle . But I did have to use both hands to examine the specimen . Its okay I understand . Maybe you could kill it with your knife ? What if I miss ? Then we 're stuck up here with no weapon at all . I 'm open to suggestions . He set us up again . Oh Marguerite what are friends for . Go crawl back under whatever rock it was you came from . Do try not to be so impetuous . Just go . Oh I wish it were that simple but you must return with me . You 're out of your mind . I should have thought that were obvious . Why would we go back with you ? To defeat Centuria of course ... since she now controls the entire lizard supply of gunpowder . And you people are responsible . Well , after all , it was Challenger who divulged the formula . How dare you blame Challenger . You made him give up the formula . So ? Pterodactyl nest . Let 's hope there 's at least one egg in there . Let 's hope mama stays out for a while . Any luck ? Chow time . It 's working Veronica . Come on , let 's get out of here . You held us prisoner remember ? And you forced Challenger to give up the formula . Yeah , and then you made up hundreds of pounds ... of gunpowder and trapped us in that little ambush of yours at the bridge . Where Summerlee disappeared . Details , details we have a crisis ... and the only question here is whether or not ... you people are going to do the right thing . Centuria 's ambition knows no bounds ... and if we don 't stop her she will enslave this entire plateau . Isn 't that what you lizards always try to do ? Frankly , Centuria 's ambition makes me look like a slacker . - What are you proposing ? - Roxton don 't encourage him . I knew you 'd come through . Lord Roxton you 're a man of honor . Don 't press your luck . We would rather not hurt you Lord Roxton . How do you know my name ? There are many things we know care of ... Tribune 's conversations with the Empress Centuria . Captain Tark . Oh this is Tark , Captain of Centuria 's elite palace guard . The pleasures all mine . Personally , I 'm delighted you eluded the hunting party . Surely you didn 't come all this way just to congratulate me . - Why are you here ? - The Empress ... needs the human who knows how to make gunpowder . Why ? Centuria 's chemist already has the formula . Yes and he 's taken it to his grave with him . That 's funny because the man you 're looking for isn 't here . I fail to see the humor in that . Oh Marguerite such a clever ploy ... but you mustn 't lie to the good Captain here . You seek the legendary scientist . Don 't be shy Professor Challenger . But ... How could you ? I had no choice Marguerite . To go after Centuria you 've put us all in danger . On the contrary , it was the only way to save all our lives . Well I 'm glad I could do my bit . The only thing keeping us alive now is that Tark ... believes you know how to make gunpowder . And when he finds out I 'm not Challenger ? If these troops ever realize you 're not Challenger ... we 're dead . What can you tell us about this Captain Tark ? What can we expect ? No wait I want to hear more about Centuria . Marguerite can we just stick to the point . Something smells funny here . I can understand her feeling threatened by Tribune ... but this definitely feels more personal . So ... were you friends ? Friendship is not a particularly lizard-like quality . That 's right , the lone wolf . Although we are capable of sharing a moment , as you well remember . Back to Centuria . We share , what you would call , a past . Before she met the Emperor . I go off to defend the outlying territories she becomes Empress . Best thing that ever happened to her ... yet she blames me wants to punish me . There are some things I will never understand . Don 't look at me . There are some things we 're not meant to understand . Maybe she 's just a little insecure . She needs to consolidate her power . There is nothing insecure about Centuria . She 's positively ruthless in pursuit of her wants . Then we really must escape out of here . Dawn will be the best time ... when lizards are not at their best . Oh my God Challenger . Malone ! Marguerite ! Roxton ! Veronica over here . What 's a lizard doing all the way out here ? Nothing good I 'll wager . Tribune ? There are a lot of them . And a wagon . It doesn 't look good , we better go after them . I 'll go on up and get more ammunition . Come on get on your feet . Captain Tark ? Go see what she wants . Oh Captain Tark ? Never mind . What is it ? Umm look its personal . This is sort of embarrassing but ... could you escort me to those bushes over there ? What ? Why ? I really need to go . I 'm a little shy , all these men . Can 't you just turn around ? I wouldn 't expect someone as powerful as you to understand this but it will only take a minute , I promise . This is ridiculous . I would be a fool to try and escape from someone like you . All right but promise me you 'll hurry . I promise Captain . The rest of you , you stay back . Thank you . - Put your weapons down ! - Shoot them ! Fire and your Captains dead ! Fire , that 's an order ! Hold your fire ! You can kill me but my men will kill all of you . Not such a good idea . When Centuria learns you killed the only man ... with the formula for gunpowder ... death will be the easy way out . What do you propose ? Hand me the sword Roxton . If you insist . Here 's the deal . You pay attention . Because it 's a one time offer . We will accompany you to the city Captain Tark ... but not as prisoners as emissaries ... going to Centuria voluntarily . And I will freely share all my knowledge with the Empress . Why should I trust you ? Because you don 't have a choice . And your way we 're all dead out here in the open ... my way you 're still a hero . We will walk into the city side by side . And in case you have any doubts ... I will still have a knife in your back . They stopped here last night ... six maybe seven lizards . Our friends must be in the wagon , prison wagon no doubt . We have to catch them before they reach the Capital . How long do you reckon we 've got ? Not long enough . Why is he still alive ? He managed to elude the hunting party . - I thought that ... - Must I do everything myself ? Why are they not shackled ? Because we are not prisoners . We come willingly Centuria . They speak ... even when not spoken to . Well , she ... they promised that they would behave . And here we are good as our word . Once Captain Tark informed me of your little ... gunpowder situation ... - I prevailed upon ... - I 've had enough ... of your help Tribune . Yes , he can be so tedious don 't you think ? Not that all men aren 't it 's that Tribune is so much more trying . I brought him back as a gift to you . Do what you want with him . Take him out kill him . Well , yes you could ... that would be such a waste . For all of his annoyance he is ... occasionally amusing ... even helpful . He did get the famous Professor Challenger to ... agree to help rebuild your stocks of gunpowder . I thought you 'd be older . That 's what makes his reputation all the more remarkable . Really ? You overestimate me . And you think this entitles you to the gift of your freedom ? Well an outright gift seems overly generous . But the chance for freedom ... that 's interesting . Why not make him a gladiator ? Marguerite ? Why not , that way you 'll provide us with some amusement . Guards take Tribune to the arena . - Sorry . - Hmmm goody . And show Professor Challenger to the laboratory . Whatever supplies you need shall be brought to you . You know this could take some time . Let 's hope it doesn 't take too long , for your sake . You will stay with me in my imperial chambers . There is much we can learn from each other . That leaves him . Empress . Lord Roxton is a great hunter . He is a brave and heroic warrior . He sounds like trouble . Kill him . You can 't kill him ! In this city I can do anything I want . Of course , all I meant was ... it would be such a waste again . Imagine a gladiator with Lord Roxton 's skills . He will live as long as he wins in the arena . Take him away . Up you lazy bums . Get out ! Keep coming . Come on get moving . Choose your weapon . Come on ! Out of there ! Move it , move it ! Where did all these people come from ? The lizards are misfits the humans prisoners ... captured in battle slaves fighting for their freedom . - Like him . - Shut up you two . Take this . Tomorrow , the Empress Centuria has decreed ... that the games will continue until only one survivor 's left ... and he will gain his freedom . Interesting . Professor ? Fascinating . Professor Challenger ? What is it ? Can 't you see I 'm trying to concentrate ? Yes , yes , but the Empress Centuria has demanded ... to see a demonstration by the end of the day . Really ? Yes those were her orders . Sometimes these things ... take their own sweet time , you tell her that . Well she won 't like it . You can 't just schedule science like a railroad . Can I tell her that we 're ordering supplies ? Tell her anything you wish . Good , good , good what supplies will you need sir ? Damn it man . - Sulfur , - Oh , yes . - Charcoal . - Yes , yes , yes . And you know ... supplies . Right yes good supplies yes , yes , yes . We 'll have a better chance after dark . 'Till then we better stay out of sight . I predict this will be the start of a wonderful friendship . I 'd like that . You 've done very well for yourself . I know how hard it can be for a woman in power . With you at my right hand , there are no limits to what I could achieve . That 's true . The things we could share , once I have the Professor 's formula . Challenger says these things take time . Science is so unpredictable . You 're too soft . It 's a human failing . This coffee is cold get another pot . Your smile is most charming Marguerite ... but you must learn to use the whip as well . You 've handled one before ? Your friend is handsome enough , for a human . Lord Roxton has many attractive qualities . I thought that this was practice . He tried to kill me . Why are they trying to kill each other ? Not kill simply trying to injure their opponents ... weaken them for tomorrows games . Charming . What 's all this talking ? We were discussing strategy . Strategy ? There 's no strategy ... when your opponents down you finish him off . Right . Eh ... it 's a dog eat dog world . How very human of you Lord Roxton . This is promising sir ? Sir ? Grind some more charcoal . Right . How long will it take to ... well , fine tune the experiment ? As long as it takes . The Empress insists on seeing a demonstration tonight . Whatever . Very good sir . Wait a minute , Potassium Nitrate . That 's it ... the third ingredient . It reacts with the oxygen ... which feeds the explosion . It 's a white powder . Oh , yes , yes , yes . Centuria wants a demonstration ... we 'll give her a demonstration . Lord Roxton ... you have shown us something quite surprising ... by saving the life of Tribune . I did ? What of it ? Apparently without a thought of the risk to yourself . Oh Lord Roxton is full of surprises . As am I. I 'm curious to see if your tactics work in combat . I can assure you from my own experience they do . Experience with humans . I fear in the heat of battle ... a lizard could easily forget his teammate . So I have a plan . You and your teammate ... Tribune , will be chained together . Your tactics will be put to a stern test . Good luck . What do you think that is ? Judging by the smell it 's a beer wagon . We can 't wait any longer . We 've got to get the others . Let 's hope the beer wagon hasn 't proved to be too popular . Come with me . Hold the top one . Challenger , I 'd buy you a drink but we better get moving . But which way ? Move along you worm , back to your dungeon . Dungeon that sounds promising . Tomorrow you 'll be fighting for your Empress ' glory . Get up you worthless dog . Roxton ! How can you eat that slop ? Big day tomorrow , you 'll need all your strength ... teammate . Don 't you start . Roxton is that you ? Challenger ? What are you doing here ? - Where 's Marguerite ? - Doing just fine as usual . That woman 's resourcefulness is an inspiration to us all . Oh it certainly gives us something to think about . You all right ? Yeah I 'm doing fine but you need to find Malone . - Where is he ? - He 's around here somewhere . Centuria thinks he 's you Challenger , expects him to make gunpowder . Gunpowder well that shouldn 't be too difficult . Not for the real you . The Empress is very interested in your progress Professor . Well it 's important to understand that ... the success of the formula depends on ... the purity and strength of the ingredients . Quit stalling . Why don 't we see what you can do then we 'll talk . Well I can 't be sure of the quality of the local ingredients . These things take time . I don 't want excuses . I want results . Very well then here goes nothing . Ha ! Now we 're getting somewhere . Make sure you 're there by tomorrow . After the gladiators in my chambers ... fail there and you 'll be disposed of . Roxton are you awake . Roxton ! You 're looking well . Marvelous , I do love the uniform . Do you mind ? Are you all right ? Have they fed you ? Oh dinner was delicious . Tribune ! We would like a moment 's privacy . Why this sudden outpouring of concern ? Centuria has asked me to be her strategic advisor . She promised that position to me ! Well that was quick , even for you . Surely you 're not asking my permission ? Why shouldn 't Marguerite save her own skin ? You truly amaze me you know . Do you have any human blood in you at all ? It would put me in a position ... - to help you and Malone . - Yes , well you best do it quickly we can 't wait too long . How are we ever going to find Malone 's lab ? Shhhh - Which way do you think it is ? - This way . How ... how do you know for sure ? Fainted smell of burnt sulfur . It 's either Malone or the gateway to hell . Stop , no , no , no , you can 't come in here . - Challenger - Challenger ? Nighty night . Challenger am I ever glad to see you . And what about me ? And you of course . But right now I need to find out about gunpowder . Centuria wants a demonstration in her chambers later this afternoon . Elementary my dear Malone . It 's a simple compound made up of three ingredients : Sulfur , Charcoal ... And Potassium Nitrate I know that ... but what about the proportions ? Oh what passes for education in America these days ? - The proportions are . - But it 's not that simple . We can 't just give Centuria the formula . Of course not . Now don 't worry ... we 'll cook up a demonstration that will knock ... her little webbed socks off . For your valor I salute you . We who are about to die salute you ! Lord Roxton , I 'm most eager to see your strategy in action . Let the combat commence . It 's going to be along day . Come on . Don 't you just love this ... and all for our own private pleasure . Come on Tribune ! Well Lord Roxton , your teamwork is very successful . Thank you . However ... it has given us a problem . I promised to spare the life of one gladiator ... but I have two victors . Centuria this is not time to quibble over words . - One . Two . - You two must fight to the death . Centuria ? One life is all I 'm in the mood to grant today . We fought as a team . We live or die as a team . Guards ! Hunt them down like dogs and kill them ! come on ! Let 's go see Challenger 's gunpowder test . This way , we 'll sneak through the sewers get out of the city . No I 'm not going without Malone , Marguerite or the others . You want to sneak back into the palace ? Well why didn 't we just let Centuria 's guards kill us in the arena ? How do you even know Marguerite wants to leave ? I 'll take that chance . Not feeling lucky Tribune ? You know sometimes Lord Roxton ... you presume on our friendship . Well ? You will not be disappointed today , Empress . I sincerely hope not . Why don 't I leave you here and lead the guards in ... search for insubordinate gladiators . Leave that to the guards that 's why we have them . You 're sure ? Enjoy the show . See how confident the Professor is ? Not only have I perfected the formula ... I 've already begun production . Watch . That 's it ? This is the fearsome explosive ? That was just a preliminary test to show you how ... sharp and clean the gunpowder burns now . I don 't want these pops and farts I want power ! As you wish Empress . Well , where are they ? I thought you knew how this palace was laid out ? The bitch redecorated . - Sorry . - Come on . Now Empress , Marguerite , get ready . This way . Come on Malone . We haven 't got much time before those guards ... Veronica ! Challenger ! What are you doing here ? Saving Malone . Which is more than you tried to do . Stop them Marguerite ! Centuria ? Stay back ! - We 're leaving . - Get up ! See , two heads are better than one . I knew I never should have trusted a weak willed human . Roxton ! You wouldn 't know this Empress but a lady always ... leaves a dance with the man who brought her . - Everyone all right ? - Were fine . You okay Roxton ? Yes . Can we leave the welcome wagon till later . Let 's get out of here . What about Centuria ? Humans . Tribune after all we 've meant to each other . Ah you look as delicious as ever my love . I shall savor every mouthful . Well that gives new meaning to the words good enough to eat . - Thank you Challenger . - Yes thank you - though I could have separated us . - Oh really ? Of course I would have chewed your hand off . - Well thank you very much . - Well it would have grown again . Afraid not . Really ? Humans don 't have the ability to regenerate lost body parts . You have so many evolutionary shortcomings . Oh we 're not without our advantages . Admit it , without our help you 'd still be Centuria 's prisoner . - Now you have your throne back . - If I must ... I must . Be careful with those ! - Our humble apologies sire . - Sire . Besides who else would have it . Marguerite ? Fraid not Tribune . Wise choice Marguerite . Lizards are two reptilian , even for you . I 'll take that as a compliment . Yes , I think it will take ... someone like me to control them . Which just leaves one question ? Who will control you ? Marguerite ? If I must , I must .

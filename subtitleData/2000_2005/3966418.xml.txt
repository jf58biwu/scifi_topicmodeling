 Pilot : The Peacekeeper scan is directly over us ... now . I believe we will survive the scan . It 's the frelling cold that will claim me . ( sneezes ) Why the yotz can 't we have a little heat ? Because the KarjikPulse is attuned to energy sources , Rygel . We 're chilled , but we 're alive . Well that depends on your definition . That 's not a Marauder scanning us . That 's Crais ' full Command Carrier . Chiana : Nobody else is going to ask. I 'll ask . Zhaan . How come you 're not frozen ? My body temperature self-regulates under most conditions . Pilot , how 's the baby doing ? Excuse me , but Moya is picking up something . It appears to be ... some sort of distress call . Source ? From one of the surrounding asteroids . I 'll see if I can isolate it . Please , please , please , hear me . I 'm stranded here with my family . We 're under attack . Please help us ! Please come quickly . As soon as you can . There 's a creature ... ( screams ) ( loud bellowing ) Could this be a Peacekeeper trick ? Zhaan : Yes , that 's entirely possible . No , the transmission source is coming from an asteroid close by . Pilot : The signal is weak . It is unlikely Crais ' ship even heard it . Aeryn : We can 't escape this asteroid field without some sort of navigational aid . Maybe this girl and her family have charts . Rygel : You 're not seriously considering going down there , are you ? For goodness sake , didn 't you see that thing ? You do not have to go down there , Your Flatulence . ( grunts ) Chiana : Distress call directed at us . ( laughing ) How stupid is that ? ( laughing ) My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . Unacceptable ! There are over 20,000 asteroids of sufficient size to block the Leviathan from our scans , sir . Then we enter the field and change our angle of projection ! If we do that , we sacrifice maneuverability . I left orders not to be disturbed . Of course , Captain , but as you labor to recapture the Leviathan , I thought I might offer a course of action it seems you have not considered yet . Do you think a mother would abandon her child ? If I was in command , Captain , I would concentrate on the Leviathan 's newborn . Bombard the area with multi-frequency signals . Discordant stimuli . See if I couldn 't make the offspring reveal itself in panic . And its mother along with it , hmm ? Sir ? Your orders ? My orders stand . Change our position . The Peacekeeper scan has passed . Crichton : One , two , three , four to beam down , Pilot . Pilot : Officer Sun . I would appreciate if you would stay aboard . Alright , Pilot . Zhaan : I suggest we deactivate our Comms , just for safety 's sake . Aeryn : Now remember , minimum use of thrusters and keep plenty of rock between you and Crais . Right ? Got it . D 'Argo : This is the most miserable place I think I have ever been . Zhaan : Where you see misery , D 'Argo , I find the end of misery . Well , to put things in perspective , Zhaan , you are the least thing on this asteroid that I 'm allergic to . Crichton : The big guy 's got a point . My rashes have got rashes . I assure you the cure for all those ailments and much more is also here . So you keep saying . Well , look around . What don 't you see ? No animals , no aviary , no insects , nothing to compete with the flora . This magnificent place is the Goddess 's pharmacognosia . Hey , don 't forget , happy campers , the girl in the distress signal said " creature . Well , she 's probably dead by now . Which is what I 'll be if I don 't get off this asteroid . Are you picking up any being 's scent ? Zhaan , let me explain to you what 's going on inside my nose right now . There 's large pieces of green mucus and gunk and ... D 'Argo , no , no , no . Stop it with the Luxan poetry . ( low growling ) There 's some healthy sounding sinuses . ( woman screams ) - Stick with me , D 'Argo . - l 'm there . ( woman screaming ) Go ! Go ! ( screaming and growling continues ) Hey ! ( roaring ) Hey ! ( gasping ) Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Whoa , hey , hey , hey ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me , please ? ! It 's all right . You 're safe now . Where are the others ? Where 's your family ? You have to protect me . No , listen to me . Where are the others ? He killed them all . Please , help me . They 're dead ? Please . Please help me . Please , please , please . He got away . He knows the terrain too well . My name is Zhaan . This is Crichton . That 's D 'Argo . We 're here to help you , dear . What 's your name ? I am M 'Lee . Look , do you have any maps so we can find our way out of this asteroid field ? Used to . All destroyed . All gone . Please , don 't leave me behind here . Not with him . Let 's go back to the Transport Pod . Transport Pod ? ls-is it well guarded ? - Come on . - Well protected ? If not , he will find it . He will attack it . Please , take me with you ! Please , let me go with you ! Please , take me with you ! D 'Argo : Fire up the drive . I 'm on it . Whoa ! ( screams ) ( roaring ) D 'Argo ! ( screams ) I told you this was a miserable place . Where are you hurt ? At the moment , everywhere . It 's gone . The access point is secure . It ain 't getting back in . We 're safe . And crippled . I hit the second fuel pump . You hit the main pressure control . Yeah , I 'll fix it . Are you okay ? I have a broken terok . Probably internal bleeding , but ... I - ( gasping ) Definitely internal bleeding . ( gasping ) Aeryn : What is it , Pilot ? What 's wrong ? Besides the obvious , a great deal . I don 't know who else I can trust but you . Trust about what ? Are you aware that Moya 's offspring isn 't normal ? The Peacekeepers have altered its genetics . Created a ship that is part Leviathan , part attack vessel . We 've all seen the baby 's weaponry . Moya is having difficulty establishing a connection to her progeny . How so ? The offspring knows he is different . There is tension between Moya and him . What do you expect me to do about it ? You were a Peacekeeper . You , better than any of us , might understand what 's been done to him . If Moya were told , perhaps she could solidify his trust in her . And us . You want me to go aboard ? Moya gives you permission to do so . But does the baby ? ( whirring ) Unbelievable . Pilot : Officer Sun . Pilot , what happened to radio silence ? Why you 're on the offspring 's command , I have a direct laser link between us . The only way that Peacekeepers could intercept is to be directly in its path . Oh . This is astounding , Pilot . It 's a complete synthesis of Leviathan and warship technologies . I need more light . ( rhythmic warbling ) ( pulsing hum ) ( chuckles ) I have light . From the exterior , the offspring appears to possess a sonic ascendancy cannon . Yes . The controls are over here . It would be advisable to locate the communications array as this may be the method the Peacekeepers will use to locate us . Communications array . ( warbling ) Communications array is in silent mode . How did you manage to find it so quickly ? I think I was supposed to . ( beeping ) Hello ? ( warbling ) ( chuckles ) What are you doing here ? Admiring your quarters , Captain . Quite opulent , even by captain 's standards . I 've never understood the need of some warriors to memorialize their conquests . Does displaying this decaying flesh remind you of past instances when you were powerful ? Your branch of the service gives you special privileges , Scorpius , which does not include disrespect of rank . I want you off my ship . Of course you do . Candidly , Captain , you have continually failed in all your duties . Your vector for success has grown quite small . Stray outside it , and I fear this ship soon may need someone else to command her . Just swallow it ! If you want to kill me , why don 't you just shoot me ? This herb will stop your internal bleeding . Would you rather I cut you open , D 'Argo ? You 're no surgeon . Exactly , now swallow . ( tool whirring ) So , how many in your group did you say ? Forty one , originally . We intended to colonize here . My father , my mother , two brothers . And they 're all ... The creature gets ravenous often . John , we need more kijmot root . D 'Argo 's injuries are not improving . Right . One quick trip to the pharmacy coming up . Out the door , turn left at the creature . You smell different . You smell like out there . Your olfactory senses are very good . I am also flora . Yeah , right . Say what ? Didn 't you know ? Know what ? You 're a plant ? Always have been , John . Why , does it bother you ? No , it doesn 't bother me . I just never suspected ... you 're a vegetable ? ( laughs ) Everyone knows that Delvians are flora evolved . ( growls ) Right . Sentient floran life isn 't all that unusual , John . I have cartilaginous fibers instead of bone . Tuperadinous cellulose tissue , and regenerative fascia membrane . The blue ? Chloroplast tintation . The yellow highlights are stomata for the transpiration of water . Ahh ! That 's why you like the light so much . Photosynthesis . Mm-hmm . ( both chuckling ) You okay ? When was the last time you ate ? I 'm not hungry yet . Huh . ( inhaling ) lt 's coming . ( whispering ) : Zhaan ! I 'm almost finished . I 've got what I need . You better pick it up ! ( whispering ) : M 'Lee ! Dammit ! You go after her. I 've finished . M 'Lee ! ( growling in distance ) ( roaring ) ( Zhaan shrieks ) I 'm sorry about your female. I was scared . It 's not your fault . No. lt was yourfault . You were meant to look after Zhaan . Instead you went running ... lt was instinct , D 'Argo ! You understand instinct . Every single thing you do is based on it . Besides , there was no indication that she 'd been ... M 'Lee : Eaten . She won 't be . The creature will take your friend to his eating grounds before killing her . Eat ? That 's it . Tell me how to get there . I can 't . You just have to know it . I 'll take you . No , no , no. lt 's too dangerous ... Let her take you , John . I can smell him long before you ever know he 's around . I 'm much better off than Zhaan . Go . Find her . Fine . Come on . ( whispering ) : This way . Over here . This is where the eating is done . We 'll be out of here as fast as we can . Damn . Ugly leftovers . is there another place he could 've taken Zhaan ? ( groaning ) You all right ? I 'm feeling ... hungry . Look , I 'll get you some food as soon as we get back to the transport . Right now ... Food . M 'Lee ... - Food ... - Do not go squirrelly on me here , all right ? You gotta help me find my friend . ( hissing ) ( shrieking ) ( creature roaring ) I ... am ... not ... your enemy . ( gasping ) She is . ( ragged breathing ) Uh-huh ... Okay . You requested my presence , Captain ? Did you suggest to my Bridge Officer that we do not adjust our current position ? Yes . Your Bridge Officer and her Crew seemed to appreciate the merits of my suggestion . You have gone too far , Scorpius . You have directly questioned my command . Your command begs question . If my actions were under examination , I would have been recalled . You were recalled . Do you forget that I have seen your memories ? That I know of your insubordination ? That I have witnessed the execution of your Second Officer ? When I bring in the Leviathan 's offspring , it will forestall any of those charges . Now , get out of my quarters . I 'll tell the Bridge Officer we won 't be changing our course . I am sorry to have hurt you . Yeah , a few words would 've saved us a whole lot of trouble . I find this atmosphere very thin . The slightest exertion leaves me unable to speak . I had no breath left . John , M 'Lee is a calcivore . She 's a feeder of bone . So she was going to eat me ? Br 'nee : Yes , just your skeleton . The flesh is left to rot . So what were you doing in our Transport Pod ? Trying to warn you . I know how the beast tricks her prey . Yeah , she said you were the monster . Yes . My parents believed so , too . But it was just a phase all children go through . ( laughing ) Br 'nee is a scientist , John . Scientist . Botanistic pharmacology . Much like the beautiful Zhaan . Oh , I am but a layperson compared to you , Br 'nee . Plants as medicine . Yes . My ancestors seeded this barren asteroid over 300 cycles ago . I simply led the first team of harvesters . What happened to the rest of your team ? Sorry . Forget that I asked . Twenty six in all . including my mate . There weren 't supposed to be any predators here . No animal life at all ! Zhaan : They first encountered M 'Lee in her dormant state , John . As we did . Br 'nee : She was cunning enough to live among us for some time and discover our weaknesses . What are hers ? Satiation . After she 's eaten her fill of bones , she reverts to the passive creature you experienced . Zhaan : It 's the only time she 's vulnerable . When she becomes hungry again she loses the control of the transition . Yeah . Been there , seen that . We have numbers again . And after she 's eaten one of us the others will have a chance to kill her . Eaten ? Yes . Br 'nee , that 's a little unacceptable . ( distant shrieks ) lt 's not your choice , I 'm afraid . It 's hers . Pilot : Officer Sun ... the Peacekeeper scan is sweeping this way again . If you are able , you must reduce the offspring 's energy signature to bare minimum . Yes , Pilot . ( beeping ) ( beeping ) What ? Come on ... ( beeping ) Do you understand what 's happening ? Officer Sun , make him understand . If they try to communicate with you they are called Peacekeepers and you must understand they are not to be believed . Look , it 's true in a perverse way , you do come from them . But so do I . Look , I wish there was more time for this , but there isn 't any time . You are going to have to decide if you will trust your mother ... us . If you 're going to trust me . ( power pulsing down ) ( relieved sigh ) Howling 's stopped . What 's that mean ? Well , at a guess , she 's gone to see if your tentacled friend is out in the open by himself . M 'Lee prefers easy prey . All right then . Pick it up , Zhaan . We got to go . Okay . Nearly ready . These leaves and fungus will completely heal D 'Argo 's injuries . I thought you wanted brocus seeds to arrest the infection . I can 't find any. I guess I 'm looking in the wrong place . You are . I take it you know a way back to our transport ? Yes , a route M 'Lee avoids , along the ridge line . Then pick it up . Let 's go . Brocus histicalx . Pick as many as you require . By the goddess , I 've never seen anything like it . We couldn 't transport all the desired samples if not for the capacity to miniaturize them . That is a very impressive machine . My aunt had one . Come on , Zhaan . Let 's go . You must stay behind with your weapon . It will scare M 'Lee away . If not , she 'll descend on everything and destroy it all ! There is no way I 'm going to let Zhaan go out there alone with you . And no way will I let that beast destroy everything my mate died to help accumulate ! We 'll be all right , John . After she 's with your friend , I 'll return and together we can help transport all the vials onto your ship . That is my one condition but it is non-negotiable ! Fine . Go . If you 're not back in an arn , M 'Lee won 't be the only one hunting you down . Capisch ? ( distant hissing ) M 'Lee ? M 'Lee ! ( roaring ) I 'm hungry , John . M 'Lee ? Take it outside , M 'Lee . Us Southern boys don 't make good eatin ' , not without a fight . M 'Lee ? M 'Lee : I have to eat , John . And I 'm it , huh ? I 've been here the whole time . I 've heard what Br 'nee said about me . What ? That you 're going to devour our bones if you get the chance ? He didn 't tell you all of it . I need you to know the truth . is that before or after I supply your recommended daily allowance of calcium ? ( screeching ) His people brought my ancestors to this asteroid for a purpose . To rid it of all herbivious life-forms . So what are you saying , spiky ? Are you saying there used to be plant-eating life here ? Thousands of creatures . Plenty of food for my ancestors . Plenty of food . Until there was nothing . Br 'nee 's kind must have known that your people would eventually decimate the food supply . They expected us to do their dirty work for them and be long dead by now . Only their precious plants would remain . How did you survive ? M 'Lee ? ( gasping softly ) ln the end , we only had each other . And then Br 'nee 's people arrived , and they became prey . I was hungry . As you are now . But I also know , after I satisfy myself on your bones , and those of your friends and finally , Br 'nee , I will eventually starve to death anyway . That 's far enough . So what did you have in mind ? I will control my hunger . And you will provide me access to a more permanent food supply . You want me to take you with us ? Br 'nee knows where my kind lives . Make him tell you , and then take me there . You have got to be kidding me , right ? Deionization charge , complete . Direct composite capability , enabled . Vaporization charge , imminent . Right . Here goes . Pilot : That 's done it . The cannon is active . I can 't fully explain it , Pilot , but this ship and I seem to have reached a bit of an understanding . Moya , too , is encouraged . Communication with her offspring is improving . She thanks you , Officer Sun . Amongst all these Peacekeeper systems , I feel quite at home . Rygel : We couldn 't be happier . Honestly . You deserve a home where you 're wanted . Pilot , I 'll be returning to Moya shortly . Please let me know if any Peacekeeper scans are imminent . Maybe you ought to stay there . Maybe you and I ought to have a little one on one when I get back , Rygel . Look , if you 've got a problem with this then all you ... Oh ! You ought to keep one foot out of your mouth . You may need it to run . ( mumbles ) Look , what slimy means is , uh , if we get attacked , the only weapon we 've got is that kid . I am not dragging this ship into a conflict not of its making . Rygel : Who said we had a choice ? D 'Argo : You know , I 'm not an enthusiast of healers , but this remarkable . Feeling better ? I am completely healed . My admiration , Br 'nee . I 've been prejudiced in the past due to charlatans . Hmm , no offense taken . What are you doing here ? Surprised I 'm not M 'Lee food ? I mean , my work ... Swamp Thing , here , ain 't the Mr. Rogers scientist we thought he was ! You forgot to mention how your ancestors brought M 'Lee 's people here , didn 't you ? ! It was the only natural way to protect what we were growing here . M 'Lee threw you a curve . She survived . She slaughtered my mates ! With good reason , it sounds like . Once I get my research out I 'll come back with a larger mission ... She 'll be dead by then . I cannot condone what his people did , but for all this unparalleled flora to flourish it may not be entirely unreasonable ... To murder sentient beings in order to save a few stinking plants ? How animal-centric of you , John . Sorry , Zhaan . I forgot . You 're a ... I am a " stinking plant . " Br 'nee : My juka ! I have heard stories of the existence of Delvians , but to actually stand in the presence ... D 'Argo : All right , enough . No offense , but I say we take this tree hugger , shove him out the access port and get the hezmana out of here . - Absolutely . - l have charts ! Charts that will take us through the asteroid fields . All right , take me there . Zhaan : No ! John . Considering the stakes , I 'll go . I think , uh , under the circumstances a cool head behind that trigger . Wouldn 't you agree ? Be careful . I will . My report to High Command . Shall I bother reading it ? To what end ? You 'll hear it all multiple times at your inquest . Disobeyed direct orders , murdered a fellow officer with premeditation , sacrificed eighteen of your elite crew in a pathetic quest for personal vengeance . It 's all in there . You are unfit for duty by any measure . I personally intend to see you stripped of rank and office . So you can take command of my Carrier ? I already have . Get off my ship ! Why must you force me to display my physical superiority to your kind as well ? If you want to fight anyone , attack your executioner . Zhaan ! Br 'nee ! Time 's up ! Screw the happy plants , guys . The transport 's repaired . ( groaning ) What the hell happened ? M 'Lee surprised us . Took Zhaan. I tried to fight her . She took Zhaan . Did she take her alive ? I 'm not sure. I don 't know . Where would she take her ? Rock wall , where l saved you from her . M 'Lee ! M 'Lee ! M 'Lee ! Where are you , you little lying sack of spikes ? You lied to me . You said you wouldn 't hurt us . Said you weren 't going to eat any of us . Then you haul Zhaan off and ... Bones . Son of a bit ... ldiot ! So , the baby 's real dag-yo ? Ah , yes . Whatever that means . Rygel : is he fast ? A major part of his design and function , I imagine . Faster than his mother ? Yes , Rygel . Fast enough to take you out of here if the Peacekeepers get too close . Listen , someone should escape this place . Carry our message to the outside . And what exactly is our message ? Chiana : That we don 't want to die out here . Very sensible . Chiana , would you come here for a microt , please ? Now let me get something straight . Both of you . Moya will not leave here without her offspring and he will not leave without her . Where does that leave us ? Very close to being thrown off this command if you don 't shut your wakket hole . Any sign of Crichton , Zhaan or D 'Argo ? Pilot 's still checking . Good . Well if they 're not here in an arn , we go and look for them . We ? She must mean you . Back already ? You made good time . Do you have the charts ? Don 't ! Don 't kill me ! Please ! I ... I ... I came ... to talk . You 're the no longer the feral beast . That means ... you 've eaten . I won 't hurt you. I promise . I cannot guarantee the same for you if you move towards me . What , uh ... who did you eat ? No one . Then why do you look like that ? I used all my remaining calcium to present myself in this way . Why ? So ... ( gasping ) ( screaming ) you ... you ... ( screaming ) you would listen . ( gasping ) I 'm ... I 'm starving to death . ( screaming ) I must eat ! You must take me with you or give me food ! ( screaming ) I 'm sorry . But I have nothing to offer you . ( gasping ) Please ? Please , anything ... anything . Except ... there 's a ship of beings out there , thousands . No one will regret their passing . You can have as many as you can lay claim to . But ... how do I ... ? How do I get there ? They 're coming soon . As soon as we start the engines and blast off from here . Oh , you ... you promise ? Thousands . I ... I ... I will ... I will control my urge . So what 's the plan , Br 'nee ? Find D 'Argo , have him take you to your home world ? You 're back . Yep . You look a lot better . Thank you. I ingested some roots to repair my wounds . Yeah . Must be a lot of interesting things in these bottles . Did you get her ? Did you kill M 'Lee ? Nope . And Zhaan ? Yeah , the blue plant . Aren 't you supposed to be looking for her ? You know , it 's funny . Sometimes I 'm very , very slow . Zhaan 's a Delvian . Plant , right ? Not animal ? No bones . Fibers instead of bones , so ... no calcium . Huh . And M 'Lee 's got a great nose . So what would she want with Zhaan ? Where is she ? What are you doing ? You fakedthose injuries . Where is she ? ! I don 't know what you 're talking about . Now please , leave my specimens alone . Zhaan . Okay , I can do this , Zhaan . I can do this . Damn , where 's the button on this thing ? I can do it. I can do it . Step away from my machine . Why would you do this to her ? She 's a Delvian . I have lived over 200 cycles consumed by my life 's work as a botanist . Until today , I could only dream of sampling such an incredible species . She has a name . It 's Zhaan . She is not dead , nor will any harm come to her . She 's in a test tube , Jack . Through her we might discover medical cures even our future dreamers dare not envision . is that not a fair trade-off ? Not to her . And not to me . I will shoot you . Nah , I don 't think so . Not without the Chakan Oil cartridge . Run ! She 's mine ! ( gasping ) What the hell am I looking at ? Justice . You okay ? Uh ... Weird sensation . Thank you . Yeah . E.S.A.S. reports a confirmed location on one of the escaped Leviathan Transport Pods . It 's landed on one of the deep-field asteroids . Sir ? Captain ? Scorpius has ordered several Marauder teams into the asteroid field . is it true what they say ? That Scorpius can sense our fears and our weaknesses ? I await your orders , sir . My orders ? Ah , do as he says . Zhaan , it 's time . Come on . Crap ! M 'Lee . Starvation ... M 'Lee , dear , I wish we could help you . Zhaan , we have to find a way to take her with us somehow , some way . No . Not unless you 're willing to sacrifice your shipmates one at a time . D 'Argo told me there were others coming , called Peacekeepers . I will try to hold on until then . But I must eat something now ! ( sobbing ) Bones . We have bones . Br 'nee . ( gnashing and ripping ) There is much cruelty in the universe . Yeah . We seem to have a treasure map to it . ( bones snapping and crunching ) Bon appetit . Pilot : The excellent trajectory charts you 've brought back will allow us to negotiate our way out of this asteroid field . Thank you , Pilot . So , tell me about the baby . John , he 's amazing , and frightening . The technology ... Zhaan : It 's such a waste . Aeryn : It 's like nothing I 've ever seen . You 'll find your way back there , Zhaan , when insanity isn 't chasing you . I 'll never be able to go back there again and you know it . Then , those miracle plants will be found by someone else . In the great scheme of things it 's all the same . Point well taken . When did our roles become reversed , sweet D 'Argo ? When you required it . Chiana : If your hand is still there in one microt , I 'll snap it off and use it as a good luck charm . ( murmuring ) Officer Sun . Yes , Pilot ? Moya has asked me to relay to you how well she and her offspring are communicating now . All thanks to you . Oh , Pilot , I did what I had to , for the good of the ship . Well , the ship has notified me that the offspring now needs a name , and she would be extremely honored if you , Aeryn Sun , were the one to choose his name . I want a three-point grid search of every square dench of this asteroid . Report any scrap of evidence you discover regarding the fugitives directly to me . Sir . We found a survivor . She spent time with the fugitives and may have information that 's useful to us . Please . Please , please , please help me . I 'm all alone here . They killed my family . Please . Please . We must know when to be strong , and when to show compassion . Thank you . Thank you . As a matter of honor , sometimes we must be willing to give of ourselves .

 I 'm voting for Dukakis . Hm ... Well ... Maybe when you have children who need braces and half of your husband 's pay cheque goes to the government , you 'll regret that . My husband 's pay cheque ? I 'm not squeezing one out till I 'm 30 . Will you still be at the Yarn Barn ? That 's a great place to raise children . - That 's really funny . - I think a year of partying 's enough . - She 's going to Harvard next fall . - I haven 't gotten in yet . You think Dukakis will provide for America till you squeeze one out ? Yeah , I do . - When can I squeeze one out ? - Eighth grade . Excuse me . Donnie , you 're such a dick . Whoa , Elizabeth ! A little hostile there . Maybe Y0U should be in therapy , then Mom and Dad can pay someone to listen to Y0UR thoughts so we don 't have to . 0K . Tell us why you stopped taking your medication . - You 're such a fuck-ass ! - - Please . - Did you just call me a fuck-ass ? - That 's enough . - Go suck a fuck ! - How does one suck a fuck ? - Shall I tell you ? - Please . - Not at the dinner table . - Stop . - Fuck ... - What 's a fuck-ass ? - ( LAUGHS ) I took a year off to be with you . - What ? - How did you know ? - I didn 't know it was a big deal . - It is a big deal . I 'm reading . Get out . Where do you go at night ? - Just get out . - Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons ' house ? - Is that why you 're here ? - No . - I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade . - Where 's my son ? I don 't recognise you . Then you take the goddamn pills . Bitch . 0ur son just called me a bitch . You 're not a bitch . You 're bitchin ' , but you 're not a bitch . I want to be a president who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator or funnel aid to the Contras through drug dealers . Values begin at the top . Dukakis ... Son of a bitch . Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House . - " Panama is a friendly country . " - Tell him , George . I talked to the president of Panama about their money laundering . Mr Noriega was there , but there was no evidence . When the evidence was there , we indicted him .

That is when the world will end . Why ? Son ? Donnie Darko ? Donnie Darko ? What the heck 's going on here ? - Who is it ? - It 's Eddie Darko 's kid . He 's just a neighbourhood kid . Guess he was sleep-golfing ? Watch out for that drool spot ! ( JIM ) Are you all right , son ? So let 's stay off the links at night , 0K ? ( D0NNIE ) I 'm sorry , Dr Fisher . It ... It won 't happen again . - Kids ... - Let 's golf . - No one 's allowed . - This is my house . - I said ... - This is my house ! Wait a minute . - Here 's your brother . - It fell in your room . Ms Darko ? I 'm Bob Garland . I 'm with the FAA . - The what ? - I 'm with the FAA . May we speak privately ? - In private ? - Please . - And here ... - 0K . All right , we have arranged a hotel . Get some sleep and we 'll take care of this . - Great . - Thank you . Kids , come on . We 're going to a hotel . They don 't know where it came from . - " Where 's Pop ? " - " He 's still at work . " If it fell from the plane ... what happened to the plane ? They don 't know , Samantha . Can 't we make money from this ? Can 't we sue the airline ? Shut up , Sam . Why do I have to sleep with Donnie ? He stinks . When you fall asleep tonight , - I 'm gonna fart in your face . - I 'm telling Mom ! Samantha , don 't go over there . Frankie Feedler . You remember . From high school . Hm ... Mm-hm . He died . Remember ? Mm-hm . 0n his way to the prom . They said he was doomed . Jesus . They could be saying the same thing about Donnie . 0ur Donnie . - But he dodged it . - Hm ... He dodged his photograph . Hm ... Hm . Somebody was watching over him . Mrs Farmer will bring you home after practice . Bye , honey . Donnie ... good luck . - 0h , my God ! Tell me everything . - I 'm not allowed to talk about it . - 0h , my God ! - Hi , Cherita . - Shut up ! - Darko cheats death ! Huh ? You 're a celebrity ! I called you a jillion times . Where you been ? - At a hotel . - Dad saw you at the golf course . - You sleepwalking again , buddy ? - I don 't want to talk about it . Now that you 're famous , have a smoke . What happens if you tell Mom and Dad , Sam ? - You 'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal . - Goddamn right , I will . - So grody . - Hey , Cherita , you want a cigarette ? - Shut up ! - " Shut up ! " Go back to China , bitch ! Just leave her alone . - That 's some good shit , huh ? - It 's a fucking cigarette .

" The grown-up gangs who ran the betting at the wrestling and the barrow-boys " would hear with respect of how 0ld Misery 's house had been destroyed . " It was as though this plan had been with him all his life , pondered through the seasons , " now , in his 15th year , crystallised with the pain of puberty . " What is Graham Greene trying to communicate with this passage ? Why did the children break into Old Misery 's house ? - Joanie ? - They wanted to rob him . If you had actually read the short story , which was a whopping 13 pages , you 'd know that the children find a great deal of money in the mattress , but burn it . Donnie Darko , perhaps with your recent brush with mass destruction , you can give us your opinion . They say it when they flood the house , when they tear it to shreds , that destruction is a form of creation , so burning the money is ironic . They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart . They want to change things . ( DOOR OPENS ) - May we help you ? - Yeah , I just registered . - They put me in the wrong class . - You look like you belong here . Um ... Where do I sit ? Sit next to the boy you think is the cutest . - ( MUTTERING ) - Quiet ! Let her choose . Joanie , get up . What people don 't understand is that Dukakis does not have the financial infrastructure ... Well , the construction guys say it will take about a week to fix the roof . Airline better not fuck us on the shingle match . - They still don 't know ? - Know what ? - Where it came from ? - 0h , no . They can 't tell us . Something about a matching serial number that got burned . I had to sign a form saying I wouldn 't talk to anyone about it . So we can 't tell anyone what nobody knows ? Yeah . But you tell ... What 's your doctor 's name ? - Dr Thurman , Dad . - Yes . Tell Dr Thurman whatever you want . - Dad . - What ? - Dad ! - 0h ... ! What 's that woman doing in the middle of the damn road ? ! No mail today . Maybe tomorrow . What did she say to you ? - I made a new friend . - Real or imaginary ? - Imaginary . - Would you like to talk about this friend ? - Frank . - Frank . - What did he say ? - He said to follow him . - Follow him ? Where ? - Into the future . And then what happens ? And then he said ... then he said that the world was coming to an end . Do you think the world is coming to an end ? No . That 's stupid . For my entire life , I was a victim of my own fear . Love . ( WOMAN ) I was feeding fear with food . Fear . Finally , I looked in the mirror . Not just in the mirror . I looked THROUGH the mirror . In that image , I saw my ego reflection . For two years , I thought it was normal for a 10-year-old to wet the bed ... Shh ! Quiet ! But the solution was there all the time . I 'm not afraid any more ! All over America , people have come together to join hands . People who believe that human life is absolutely too important , too valuable and too precious to be controlled by fear . ( FRANK ) Pay close attention . You could miss something . Hello .

" The Last Unicorn " by Samantha Darko . - Give it back ! - " There was once a unicorn named Ariel ... " - You wrinkled it . - It 's not wrinkled , Sam . It 's 7.45 . The bus should 've been here 20 minutes ago . Maybe Martha finally went nuts and hijacked it . There 's this rule - at 7.45 , we get to go home . There 's no rule . Cherita , you should ... go home . Yeah , if you 're here when the bus comes , we 'll get in trouble . - Shut up ! - " Shut up ! " Hey , Porky Pig ... I hope you get molested . Hey ! Hey ! I can 't believe this ! School 's closed today because it 's flooded . - No way ! - Yeah . Holy shit ! That 's the best news ever ! My God , is this ever going to stop ? Eventually , yes . But right now , I got 12 classrooms full of water . All coming from a busted water main . - What else ? - What else ? Principal Cole , I 'll show you what else . That 's unbelievable . That 's solid bronze , isn 't it ? - Yep . - How did this happen ? I heard a cat burglar trashed everything and the Mongrel got his head cut off . - Hah ! - True ! Beth 's mom said the boys ' locker room flooded and they found faeces everywhere . - What are faeces ? - Baby mice . Hey . Has anyone ever told you that you 're sexy ? I like your boobs . Hey . Hey . School 's cancelled . Do you want to walk me home ? Sure . - Don 't look so freaked . - I 'm not . Check your backpack . Those guys steal shit . Fuck ' em ! - So , why 'd you move here ? - My parents got a divorce . My mom got a restraining order against my stepdad . He has emotional problems . I have those , too . What kind does he have ? He stabbed my mom four times in the chest . 0h . Did he go to jail ? No , he fled . They still can 't find him . Mom and I had to change our names . I thought Gretchen Ross was pretty cool . I was in jail once . I mean ... I burned down this house . It was abandoned , but I got held back in school and I can 't drive till I 'm 21 . But I 'm over all of that . I 'm ... painting and stuff . Writing . I want to be a writer . Maybe a painter . Maybe both ... I 'll write a book and draw the pictures . Then maybe people will understand me . I don 't know , change things .

Joseph Lister , 1895 . Before antiseptics , there was no sanitation , especially in medicine . You mean soap ? Well , I 'm really glad school was flooded today . Why is that ? We 'd never have had this conversation . You 're weird . Sorry . No , that was a compliment . Well , look , uh ... You want to go with me ? - Where do you want to go ? - No , I mean , like , " go " with me . - You know , like " going together " . - Sure . 0K . Where are you going ? I 'm going home . ( MUTTERS ) Stupid ... " Where are you going ? " I 'd like to try something new . Have you ever been hypnotised ? No . When I clap twice , you will wake up . Do you understand ? - Yes . - So , tell me about your week . I met a girl . What is her name ? Gretchen . We 're going together now . Do you still think about girls a lot ? Yeah . - How are things going at school ? - I think about girls a lot . I asked you about school , Donnie . I think about fucking a lot during school . - What else do you think about during school ? - " Married With Children " . - You think about your family ? - I just turn down the volume and think about fucking Christina Applegate . I asked you about your family . No . I don 't think about fucking my family . That 's gross . I 'd like to hear about your friend Frank . Sam Bylan . Cherita Chen . Donald Darko . Daye Dennis . Hey , you fuck ! Did you say I flooded the school ? - I didn 't say shit . - Yeah , well , they think I did it . If you 're innocent , then you have nothing to worry about , right ? Fuck you ! You know what I think ? I think you did it . Beer and pussy - that 's all I need . - We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette . - Smurfette ? Mm-hm . Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick . Like , this cute little blonde that 'll get down with the guys like Smurfette does . Smurfette doesn 't fuck . That 's bullshit . Why do you think Papa Smurf made her ? Because the other Smurfs were getting too horny . - Not Vanity . I heard he was a homosexual . - Then she fucks them while Vanity watches . What about Papa Smurf ? He must get some action ? What he does , he films the gang-bang . Later on , he beats off to the tape . First of all , Papa Smurf didn 't create Smurfette . Gargamel did . She was sent as Gargamel 's evil spy to destroy the Smurf village , but the overwhelming goodness of the Smurfs transformed her . And as for the whole gang-bang scenario , it just couldn 't happen ! Smurfs are asexual . They don 't even have reproductive organs under those little pants . That 's what 's so illogical about being a Smurf . What 's the point of living if you don 't have a dick ? Donnie , why you gotta get smart on us ? Grandma Death . ( MISS FARMER ) Excuse me ! Excuse me ! Please stay off the road , Miss Sparrow , or I will call Social Services . I hate that Miss Farmer . She 's such a fucking bitch ! Yeah . - How old is Grandma Death ? - ( D0NNIE ) 101 . She does the same thing every day . Just walks back and forth and back and forth to the mailbox . Nothing ever in there . 0h , wait , wait , wait ... She 's going back to the box . We may still have mail . - Mail , mail , mail . - Here it is . This could be it . 0h ... ? - 0h , no dice , Grandma . Sorry . - Someone ought to write that bitch . Authorities continued their search for a suspect in the Middlesex Ridge School vandalism . The private school has asked for donations to restore its beloved mascot , known only as the Mongrel ... It 's very helpful . There 's a good turnout tonight . What are you trying to accomplish here ? There was urine and faeces flooded in my office . Whatever fits . " Whatever fits " ? In cooperation with the county police , we have begun an active investigation into the cause of the flooding . And our suspects include several of our own students ... I want to know why this filth is being taught to our children . Kitty , I would appreciate if you would wait ... Dr Cole , not only am I a teacher , but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child . Therefore I am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge . ( FRANK ) Don 't worry . You got away with it . I have in my hand Graham Greene 's " The Destructors " . This short story is part of my daughter 's English assignment . In this story , several children destroy an elderly man 's house from inside out . How can you do that ? And how do they do this ? They flood the house by breaking through a water main . I can do anything I want . And so can you . And I think that this garbage should be removed ! Excuse me . What is the real issue here ? The PTA doesn 't ban books . The PTA must acknowledge that pornography is being taught in our curriculum ! - It 's meant to be ironic . - Excuse me . Go back to grad school . Why did you make me flood the school ? They are in great danger . Do you even know who Graham Greene is ? I think we have all seen " Bonanza " . Well , um ... while we are on other topics ... Where do you come from ? Do you believe in time travel ? ( SAMANTHA ) Who are you talking to ? I was just taking my pills , Sam . A storm is coming , Frank says . A storm that will swallow the children , And I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain . I 'll deliver them back to their doorsteps , send the monsters back to the underground . I 'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them . Except for me . Because I am Donnie Darko . Who is Frank ? - A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit . - ( GIGGLING ) In these modern times , our attitude and beliefs are so delicate , so fragile . I have had a Cunning Vision . This vision has released me . It 's important that our lifeline be rejuvenated , so that we can breathe again . It 's time to breathe . It is time to breathe . Thank you , Jim Cunningham . Thank you , Jim Cunningham . So now let us begin Lifeline Exercise Number One . Please press stop now . As you can see , the lifeline is divided into two polar extremes . Fear and love . Fear is in the negative energy spectrum . - Love is in the positive energy spectrum . - No , duh ( ! ) Excuse me ? " No , duh " is a product of fear . Now , on each card is a character dilemma which applies to the lifeline . Please ... Take this . Thank you . Please read each character dilemma aloud and place an " X " on the lifeline in the appropriate place . Cherita ? " Juanita has an important math test today . " She 's known about the test for several weeks , but has not studied . " In order to keep from failing , Juanita decides to cheat on the math test . " Good . Good . Very good . Mr Darko . " Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money . " She takes it to the address on the driver 's licence but keeps the money . " I 'm sorry , Miss Farmer . I don 't get this . Just place an " X " in the appropriate place . I know what to do , but you can 't lump things into two categories . The lifeline is divided that way . Well , life isn 't that simple . I mean ... Who cares if Ling Ling keeps the money ? It has nothing to do with fear or love . - They are the deepest human emotions . - 0K . But you 're not listening to me . There are other things to take into account , the whole spectrum of human emotion . You can 't just lump everything into two categories and deny everything else ! If you don 't complete the assignment , you 'll get a zero . Donald , let me preface this by saying that your Iowa Test scores are ... intimidating . So ... Let 's go over this again . What exactly did you say to Miss Farmer ? I 'll tell you . He asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus ! Nobody cares about responsibility , morality , family values ... Kitty ... Excuse us , please . They 've suspended him from after-school activities for six months . Since this jet engine fiasco , I don 't know what 's gotten into ... I 'll say this because our daughters are on the dance team together and I respect you , but after witnessing your son 's behaviour , I have significant doubts about your ... 0ur paths through life must be righteous . Go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son doesn 't succumb to the path of fear . Do you remember that weird gym teacher , Mrs Farmer ? Yeah . 0K , well , my brother told her to shove a book up her ass today . And then my parents just bought him all this new shit . Yeah , I know . I wish a jet engine would fall on my room . - Dr Monnitoff . - Donnie . Um ... I know this is gonna sound kind of weird , but do you know anything about ... time travel ? A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge , which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man . So , according to Hawking , a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time . So to travel back in time , you have to have a spaceship faster than the speed of light . - Theoretically . - And be able to find a wormhole . The basic principles of time travel are there . Your vessel and portal . Your vessel can be anything . - Like a DeLorean ? - Metal craft of any kind . You know , I love that movie . It 's so ... like , futuristic , you know ? Listen , um ... don 't tell anybody that I gave you this . Woman who wrote this used to teach here . She was a nun long before that . Then overnight she became this entirely different person . She up and left the church , wrote this book ... She started teaching science , right here at Middlesex . " The Philosophy 0f Time Travel " . Roberta Sparrow ? That 's right . Roberta Sparrow ? Roberta Sparrow . Grandma Death . It 's called " The Philosophy 0f Time Travel " . - What does philosophy have to do with it ? - Guess who wrote it . Who ? Roberta Sparrow . Huh ! She wrote a book . - Grandma Death wrote a book . - That 's a terrible nickname . We almost ran her down the other day . She lives in that piece of crap house , and you know she 's loaded . - You 're right . - She was known for her gem collection . Kids used to go up there all the time and try to steal stuff from her . She became a total recluse . Huh ! I didn 't know she was alive till we damn near knocked her down . ( DONNIE ) She was just standing in the road , frozen . I walked over to see if she was OK . And she whispered in my ear . - What did she say ? - I think Frank wants me to talk to her . He asked if I knew about time travel . She wrote a book about it , so that can 't be a coincidence , right ? What did she say to you ? She said that every living creature on earth dies alone . How did that make you feel ? It reminded me of my dog Callie . She died when I was eight and she crawled underneath the ... the porch . To die . To be alone . Do you feel alone right now ? I don 't know ... I 'd like to believe I 'm not , but I just ... I 've just never seen any proof , so I just don 't debate it any more . I could spend my whole life debating it over and over and still wouldn 't have proof , so I just don 't debate it any more . It 's absurd . The search for God is absurd ? It is if everyone dies alone . Does that scare you ? I don 't want to be alone . And his tapes have made me realise that for the last 39 years , I have been a prisoner of my own fear . Fear . You have got to meet this Jim Cunningham . I can 't believe he 's single . ( COMMENTATOR ) It has been a disappointing night for these Super Bowl champions . ( 2ND COMMENTATOR ) You 're right , Dan . Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines . He 's gotta be thinking , " What happened ? What went wrong tonight ? " - " ( DAN ) And here 's the kick . " - 0h ! It 's no good ... - Shit , we need a quarterback . - We need a miracle . - We need to go for a safety . - " What the future holds for this MVP , " we 'll have to wait and see . You guys want anything ? ( TV ) This week on " Who 's The Boss ? " Samantha borrows Tony 's van and gets caught without a licence . ( DAN ) Better make sure we don 't miss that one . Here we are again . Fourth down now ... - ( BELL RINGS ) - ( TEACHER ) Tomorrow , we meet our partners for the Young Inventors ' Fair . What if you could go back in time and take those hours of pain and replace them with something better ? - Like images ? - Yeah , a Hawaiian sunset or the Grand Canyon . - Things that remind you how beautiful ... - We 've been going together for two weeks . Yeah ? Well , I er ... I ... You want to kiss me ? - I 'm sorry , I ... - Look , Donnie , wait . I just ... - Well , I like you a lot . - I just want it to be at a time when ... it ... - When what ? - When it reminds me just ... When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be ? Yeah . And there 's some fat guy staring at us . I don 't think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus is something that should go without consequence . I think we should buy him a moped . I think we should get a divorce . - You won 't tell Mom , will you ? - Why would I ? - You tell Mom everything . - No , I don 't . - Let me see it . - No , it 's not finished . It 's ... 0K . It 's cool . That 's scary . You think ? Thank you for seeing us at such late notice . - We both felt we should come and discuss ... - What I think is going on with your son . Yes . Um ... Well , he 's er ... You know about his past , and he was suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher . I 'm not sure that 's a good example . I think he had just cause . Rose , let me lay out what I believe is happening here . Donnie 's aggressive behaviour ... his increased detachment from reality , seem to stem from his inability to cope with the forces in the world that he perceives to be threatening . Has he ever told you about Frank ? Frank ? Yes , the giant bunny rabbit . The what ? I don 't recall him ever having mentioned a rabbit . Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination . This is a common occurrence among paranoid schizophrenics . - What can we do ? - I would like to do more hypnotherapy ... .. and increase his medication . Whatever will help him , really , is ... That 's why we 're here . We just would like him to experience some relief . So if you think that more medication will do that , then I think we should give it a try . then I think we should give it a try .

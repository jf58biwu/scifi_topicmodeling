Balk ! What 's happened to my grandfather ? What do you mean by will ? ! Hey , what is this ? Let 's help ourselves to that . Got you ! Oh no ! Hmph ! That woman was following us ? So was she after that book ? Or something else ... Don 't just stand there in a daze ! Maria ! Maria ! Go inside ! Protect this girl ! Hurry ! Wait , Yuuki 's ... Asuka ! Yuuki ! Wait !

We are not your enemies . If you are , I 'll kill you all . Let me tell you Mr. Erimiya 's real name . What ? Is something the matter , Kai ? Oh , no . This way . Oh , no . This way . Episode Twenty One Cruel Flame You shouldn 't be failing . Shut up ! You 're going to work too . You heard what they were talking about , right ? This is the jackpot . What 's the big deal about a book like that ? Just burn it . Even Eiji will probably want that book . I can 't get fired up over it . I saw the signature imprinted in that book . Whose ? Martinus the Fourteenth . Who in the world is that ? You 're an idiot . That 's right , Martinus the Fourteenth . The former head of the church that disappeared all of the sudden ? That 's right . He left the church , and under the name Erimiya , gathered psychics together here in Gald . Why would that old man do that ? To truly save us psychics . It is still an unhappy time to live as a psychic . We don 't want to be used by Ashurum , and we don 't want to serve the church . So you just want to be free , like everyone else , huh ? We 're people too , after all . That 's ... I met a psychic who can 't say that ... Because he 's an idiot . No , it takes determination to say that . And someone who shows the way ... I 'm not a psychic , but it 's not like I don 't understand . But still ... I don 't understand why I have to help you guys out ! Actually , I feel the same . Wha ? But Mr. Erimiya chose you . Whatever that old man said ... Look out ! So this time it 's you ? What do you want ? Nothing . It 's just that I get sore if I don 't move around some . There ARE psychics here . Will I be able to have a little fun ? If you don 't fight for your life , you 'll be killed on the spot . Why would Grandfather write a will ? Maria ... What has happened to my grandfather ... He 's really important to you , isn 't he , Maria ? Grandfather took me in off of the streets and raised me ... He raised you ? Ever since I was very young ... I was taken in too , by Yuuki . What ? He raised me , so I can understand your wanting to be with your grandfather . Maria ? Asuka , meet with my grandfather , and help him . You are the pure soul of a baby . You are a false life created by the hand of man . You are a fool that knows neither impurity nor fear . Foolish one ... Foolish one , your name is ... Were you predicting your own future or something ? Maxim , who are you ? To you , I 'm the Grim Reaper . You 're not the one that will be walking the path of the Grim Reaper . I will defy my destiny . Fool , why are you impure ? Kai ... Gald 's electrical supply system is just ahead , on the fourth underground level . There 's a rumor that the church is involved with its management too . That 's strange . Yeah , it is . Gald 's underground levels are full of strange stories . And we all live above that strange foundation . You 're an exception though , aren 't you , Kai ? What about you ? What ? People that find Gald strange have some reason for thinking that . Whether or not they 've lived here for a long time . Umm , I ... What 's wrong , Kai ? Leonid , get away from me ! Kai ? ! Get back ! Kai ... you 're a psychic ? Georg ! Small fry ! Grandfather took in and raised abandoned psychic children . Myself , and many others besides . Right ... We all hated our powers . But Grandfather gently showed us the way . Why you ! That hurt ! Take that ! You 're just a plain old human . Ridiculous . Hurry up and die . Run ! You idiot ! You 're next . Don 't be in such a rush . If I 'm going to be first , then don 't turn your back on me ! You all right , old man ? Take this ... Yuuki Tokugawa ... Fulfill Mr. Erimiya 's request ... Before that , we need to get out of here , right ? Player substitution ... You bastards ... enough is enough ! Wait ! Nuisance ! Wait ! Nuisance ! Old man ! You go too . I don 't think so ! What ? He 's my prey . I 'm going to kill him myself . What are you saying ? You lost , didn 't you ? What did you say ? ! I still haven 't had enough fun yet . All I care about is that I have fun ! Dummy . Don 't you dare burn the book , too . Well , have fun . Damn , I was aiming for your heart , you know ? Heh ... you suck . Nah , it just means I get to have more fun . This time ... you get this ! The way you are now , you can 't even use your excellent gun skills ! I 'm definitely going to kill you ... Bold words ... now , next is ... You can 't hit me ! Idiot ! I 'm down here ! What ? ! In the end , you 're just a human . And with this , you 're through . What ? ! Yuuki ! Kai ! Kai Kudou ! So it 's you ! This is ... Kai ! Wait ! Don 't use any powerful attacks ! Why not ? We 're right next to Gald 's electrical system ! Your attacks will trigger a meltdown ! No way ! Let 's do this for real ! Burn ! It can 't be ! It 's going to get me AND my power ? ! I said not to use powerful attacks , didn 't I ? Sorry . So , why are you here ? Not here ... It 's further in ! Hey ! Kai ! Maria ? My grandfather should be straight ahead . I 'm sorry , Asuka . Huh ? Wait here . Huh ? Wait here . Maria ! What happened to your precognition ? Couldn 't you foresee this situation ? Can 't you understand the sorrow that being able to see the future entails ? I don 't want to understand . And that is why you are a fool . You know neither joy nor sorrow . Don 't you dream about the future ? I don 't care about the future or ... Are you unable to dream ? Yes . Everything simply passes on . Have you truly accepted that ? You called me a fool . Will that fate be changed ? It 's up to you . That can 't be . It 's not my fate alone . If you want to change it , then you have no choice but to change it . It can 't be changed . I will pass on too . All you have to do is find it , your own personal fate . Are you trying to decide fate ? You don 't even have the power to do that ! Stop it ! Double One Eight ! Mister ! If you want to change fate , then stop me . You 're ... What 's the matter ? Hurry up ! Stop it ! Please be all right , Grandfather ! He 's fast . But ... he 's still not good enough ! Is that all you 've got ? Is this the level at which your true power is ? I can 't ... move ... What is this power ? At this rate , there 's no use in taking it away , and no joy in destroying you . Mister ! Your power is worthless . Grandfather ! Ohh ... Maria , why ... I wanted to ... change this ... Grandfather ! Mister ! Return to Ashurum , Kai . Maxim ... Sagimiya ordered us to bring that telepath back with us . Eiji did ? Why ? Give Grandfather back ! Wait ! Please wait ! How dare you do that to Grandfather ! You 're wrong ! I ... Shut up , Ashurum ! I 've retrieved Kyou , AND I got a souvenir too . I won 't forgive you ... I won 't forgive you , psychics of Ashurum ! Oh my , were you in the middle of a discussion ? Scary ... We 're going home . Give Grandfather back ! I won 't let you get away ! Kai , what 's going on ? Kai ! Hey , Yuuki . You can tell me just a little bit , can 't you ? I told you , Ashurum just destroyed one of the guerilla organizations . That 's all . I 'm asking why you were involved . Hey , Kai . I showed you the way , right ? How about trading me some information in exchange ? I 'm sorry , Leonid . What do you mean , " sorry ? " I don 't really know . You were there , so there 's no way you don 't know what happened , right ? I don 't know ... Eiji ! Eiji ! Eiji ! Naozumi . I didn 't think you 'd come to visit me in the hospital . Don 't mess with me ! Forty-seven people ! Forty-seven people have died during this one-hundred-day investigation ! Exactly what kind of investigating did you make them do ? ! Illness ! Unnatural death ! My subordinates have been dying left and right due to mysterious reasons ! What is with that ocean area ? ! With those coordinates ? Does that point in Gald have something to do with them ? I 'm glad that you didn 't die . That 's not the issue ! Naozumi . Yeah ? Find another place that has the same influence . There should definitely be others . What did you say ? The curtain is about to open on a new chapter in history .

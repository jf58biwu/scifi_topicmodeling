 Self-destruct sequence initiated . They 're out there now ! Taunting me , calling me ! Self-destruct in ten , nine , eight , seven , I must ... resist . Six , five , four , three , two , one . Self-destruct sequence terminated . All systems normal . No ! I am Abraham Van Helsing , captain of mother III , a deep space salvage ship . Fourteen days ago , I got a tip from a friend at the confederation that a large cargo ship , the demeter , that a large cargo ship , the demeter , that had been lost for years , had been spotted in the carpathian system . Nothing unusual about that . There are lots of floaters in that system . But what is unusual is that the ship was moving as if it had a heading- - Earth . So , if I can get to the demeter before the confederation lays claim to it , the ship and whatever 's on it will be ours , free and clear . I just hope that my crew can handle a job this big . This ship is massive , and there are only six of us . This ship is massive , and there are only six of us . This is the smartest guy on the crew . We call him the professor . And we 'd be in good hands if he knew half as much as he thinks he does . Mina , our navigator , technically an intern from the academy of intergalactic navigation ... So she works for free , which offsets the fact that we spend half our time lost in space . But , hey , you never know what you might find out there . This is Humvee- - All brawn , zero brains . Perfect for salvage jobs , heavy salvage jobs perfect for salvage jobs , heavy salvage jobs and heavier salvage jobs and ... Well , you get the idea . We call this guy 187 . And they tell me 187 was his I.Q. Before he enrolled at Berkeley 's satellite campus and started smoking everything in sight . Aurora , my vice captain . Keeps to herself . More than a little abrasive . It 's her first time out with a crew like this one , and looking like that doesn 't help her cause . But what she lacks in people skills , she more than makes up for in ambition . But what she lacks in people skills , she more than makes up for in ambition . And if we get into a tight spot , I think she 'll pull through . Ah , there she is , captain , the demeter . Think we can salvage her ? I don 't see any problem . She seems pretty intact to me . Any sign of life ? Professor . No emb response , no electros , no pulse signal . Nothing calculable , captain . Nothing ? Nothing ? No . Our tractor beam should be able to bring her up alongside us , and we can access her main loading bay . Take us in nice and easy . You 're up , Mina . Get on that ship . Keep moving . Hello ? Anybody home ? Nothing here , professor . I 'm scanning cold . Well , keep moving . Come on . That 's not fair . I don 't know why I always gotta go first . It 's not really what I signed up for . What did you sign up for ? I 'm a navigator ! What did you sign up for ? I 'm a navigator ! I don 't know what looking around spooky old ships has to do with navigation . Someone tell me . I 'd love to know . Know how many people would love to be in your shoes , working long hours with a bunch of sweaty guys for no money ? You don 't know how good you got it . Right . Just get your ass on that ship . June 3 , 2950 . We have experienced engine difficulty and are running at quarter speed . Repairs will be completed repairs will be completed as soon as the first and second engineer get over ... I won 't say , um , epidemic , but at least half of the crew is now afflicted . I have implemented strict quarantine procedures and confined myself to quarters . Mina ? Mina , don 't leave us in the dark . What 's going on ? What 's going on , little sister ? Mina , come in . Would you sort out her comms . There 's nothing wrong with her comms . Something 's up with her heart monitor . It 's taking off . Something 's up with her heart monitor . It 's taking off . Rate 's ascending past 80 . Past 90 . 100 . 110 . 120 . 135 . Shit . This is disconcerting . No ! You okay , little girl ? Humvee . Let me go . You gonna behave ? Let go ! What 's up , little girl ? I thought I saw something . I took a wrong turn and ... I got disoriented . You got lost . How you gonna get lost with a damn scanner ? Hummer ? Yeah , boss ? Daddy 's little girl , she 's okay . She claims she got lost . Is she okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . I 'm sorry . Hummer , is she okay ? Hummer , is she okay ? Yeah , she 's all right . She 's still the same little shameless little ho she 's always been , though . I want you to check the O2 levels . Yeah , cap . It 's 87 % . Sweeter than home . Eighty-seven ? Are you sure ? Yeah , I 'm sure . As sure as my package is bigger than yours . You want to come down here and find out for yourself ? Okay , I know how sure you are about your package . Go environmental . Go environmental . You got it . You first . Up yours . All right . We 'll do this job together . On three , okay ? One , two ... Three ! Whoa ! That smell ! Humvee ? What 's going on , Humvee ? Captain , Humvee 's down ! Captain , Humvee 's down ! Don 't panic . Try to help him . Humvee ? Humvee . Humvee- - Animal ! Ech ! Your life will be changed for the better now . Once you go black , you never go back . Mina , what 's going on ? Hey , cap 'n , she 's okay . We 're just getting a little face time with miss-da-Mina . Well , cut it out . Well , cut it out . Damn , I 'm never gonna get no action on this damn ship . Hey , cap , the air 's a-OK , daddy-o . Okay , we 're comin ' in . You okay ? Some mouthwash would be nice . Pull another stunt like that , and you 'll be cleaning the head all the way home . Got me ? Pull another stunt like that , and you 'll be cleaning the head all the way home . Got me ? Okay , cap . Off-world transporter , captain . Silvestri , mark 4 . I 'd say she 's about 50 years old . Fifty years ? Oh , at least . Better get out of here . Think she 's still got juice in her ? Perhaps . There 's only one way to find out . Where 's the fission room ? That way . Let 's see if we can get this tub runnin ' . Where the fuck is 187 ? I 'm not nobody 's baby-sitter . June 5 , 2950 . The situation couldn 't be worse . Engines are down , and we 're adrift , still in the carpathian galaxy . The comm system is only ... half working . We can only receive incoming messages . Our distress signals are not being transmitted . Our distress signals are not being transmitted . We seem to be losing complete control of the functions of the ship . Half of the crew have been overcome by ... It 's unlike ... Anything I have seen . ♪ Ooh ! 187 ! Get your rinky ass down here now ! ♪ In the underground ♪ ♪ are you out there ♪ ♪ out there ♪ ♪ are you out there ♪ ♪ out there ♪ Hey , I ain 't kidding , 187 . Get your butt down here ! All right , captain buzzkill . All right , captain buzzkill . Hang ten , dude . Surf 's up ! Hydroponically speaking , of course . ♪ Are you out there ♪ ♪ out there ♪ ♪ are you out there ♪ ♪ out there ♪ ♪ out ♪ ♪ out there ♪ ♪ there ♪ ♪ out ♪ ♪ out ♪ Ah ! Uh , o-over there . Sh-shine your torch over there . Ah , there it is , sir . Central control unit . Uh , hello ? Aren 't we forgetting something ? Thanks . Humvee , Aurora , take a look around . Yo , captain ! Dude ! You better come have a look at this . Stay with the professor . You two , come with me . Cap , I thought you said we could ... Hey , Hummer ? Cap , I thought you said we could ... Hey , Hummer ? Yes , boss ? I put up with your shit because you 're big , black and ... Ugly . Here we go again . I 'd love it if you 'd just learn to take an order and shut the fuck up . Mina . June 9 , or 10 . I doubt it matters . We are a ghost ship . Communications , navigation , weapons , even the hand phasers , are dysfunctional ! Only the basic life support system have remained unaffected . We are alive , but powerless . The crew is beyond ill , beyond human . I have ordered the few of us left unaffected to remain quarantined in our quarters . Think you can fix it ? Mm-hmm . Don 't . What ? Don 't . Pretend you can 't . Don 't . Pretend you can 't . Why would I not want to get this thing humming and validate myself once again with amazing feats of my advanced intelligence ? So we can get out of here , onto mother where we belong . Come on . The smell alone . I 've got a bad feeling about this ship . Feelings will get you into trouble , Mina . As a mentor to you , I have to impress upon you that you should rely as solely as possible on your intellect . Trust your feelings , and you 'll worry . Trust your feelings , and you 'll worry . Trust your head , and you 'll be fine . Now , look around . This is a spaceship , not a forest . No snakes here . Nothing 's gonna bite you . What have we got here ? Whoa ! What happened to him ? Whoa ! What happened to him ? Human jerky . I wonder , is it spicy ... don 't touch it ! Why ? It 's one of your ex-boyfriends , huh ? Yeah , we know how much you like it stiff . You guys are so funny , I just don 't know what to do with myself . This is a crime scene . We shouldn 't touch anything . We 're still under new world jurisdiction , and the law is the law . We 're still under new world jurisdiction , and the law is the law . Who died and made you sheriff of this damn town ? Hey , Humvee , I 'm second in command , and you are just a member of my posse . Guys . Captain , I don 't need this shit ... If you 're gonna be a captain in the future , you 're gonna have to learn to have a little Patience with the men . Guys . Hey , guys ! What ? Captain , there 's something weird about this dude 's bindings , man . I mean , it 's like he tied himself to the chair . I mean , it 's like he tied himself to the chair . What would make him do that ? Dude , how should I know ? I don 't know what type shit they was into back in 2953 . What 's that ? Ah ! A metal plus sign . Okay , this dude was into mathematics . That explains everything ! You need so much help . It 's a crucifix . I thought they banned those 200 years ago , man . I thought they banned those 200 years ago , man . Yeah , but that didn 't mean everybody gave it up . He probably felt like he needed god 's help . Supposedly , I had a granduncle who believed in god , but ... I can 't say I ever met anybody who did . Right on time , professor . What do we do with leatherface here ? Bag him ? You know what ? Bag him ? You know what ? I-if you look at him in a certain way , doesn 't he remind you of interstellar union president Baker ? We 're gonna do what Aurora says- - play it by the book , take him back to earth . But , captain ... Then we 're gonna let the off world boys take a look at him and give him his long overdue burial . Captain , I 'm gonna have to insist that we check this corpse for illegal substances . Get the hell out of here . But ... Now ! There but by god 's grace ... go I. Hey , who 's god ? Nobody . I hear them ... Beyond my door at night . I can 't bear to say what I suspect . I have no control over navigation , but ... Something is moving us toward earth . Does she have the juice to get us home ? Mm-hmm . Good . It 'll be faster if we tow mother . That 's why I 'm doing my thing here , captain . That 's why I 'm doing my thing here , captain . How much do you think she 's worth ? Hard to say . I don 't know . Maybe fifteen ? Ooh . Fifteen ? Million . Dude ! Do you know how much hydroponic platinum I could buy with my share ? Wait a minute . Yes ? Although it 's not technically illegal , we really shouldn 't tow this back to earth until we 've found out what 's gone on here . We really shouldn 't tow this back to earth until we 've found out what 's gone on here . The safest thing to do is to leave it , report it to the proper authorities and let them check it out before we bring this ship back in contact with our own planet . Woman , are you crazy ? And lose 15 million credits ? Woman , are you insane ? Raise your hand if you want to talk next time . And what if we don 't even make it back to earth ? It doesn 't matter if it 's 50 , a hundred , a billion , it doesn 't matter if it 's 50 , a hundred , a billion , if we 're not alive to spend it . Little rich girl talking again , huh ? Your ass ain 't never been hungry , and we 're not gonna pass up this kind of cheese . What happened to the crew ? I mean , these ships just don 't fly by themselves . For your information , dude , we did find somebody . You did ? A dead somebody , and we don 't know what happened to him . Whatever happened here is long over and done with . We can 't just leave her here for another salvage crew . We can 't just leave her here for another salvage crew . Captain 's damn straight ! Yeah . It doesn 't add up in my book , is all I 'm saying . Well , don 't worry about it . The captain must have kept a vidlog , and I 'm sure that 'll shine some light on what happened here . Sure . Yeah . Why don 't you two do a little recon , see if you can find anything else worth something . Hey , maybe we can find something to smoke . Come on , Hummer . Let 's go . After you . We should check the cargo bay . Man , what for ? Fifty years ago , before dope was legal , they used to smuggle it across the solar systems in ships like this . So you can get shit that you can 't buy over the counter now . Dope wasn 't regulated . Man , you 're high enough now . Ain 't no such thing . You know I 'm like a weightlifter when it comes to my smoke . Ain 't no such thing . You know I 'm like a weightlifter when it comes to my smoke . All right . If you was lifting a hundred kilos a day , and it 's you 're first day at the gymnopod doing ten reps , you 're going to be sore and you won 't be able to move . Mm-hmm . But imagine lifting that same hundred kilos every day for five years . Then it 's like you ain 't lifting a damn thing . Man , you 've been smoking a hundred kilos a day for five years . You understand what I 'm saying ? Not quite that much , but you get the idea , dude . Not quite that much , but you get the idea , dude . Man , come on ! Finish the patrol . I got to get my weight up . Come on . Oh , that 's strange . What ? It 's reading like a separation sequence was initiated from on board mother . What the fuck 's going on ? Talk to me , professor . It 's reading a separation sequence , captain . Well , stop it . I should be able to prevent disengagement here from the host vehicle . Shouldn 't be too much of a problem . I fucking told you guys ! Oh , my god , it 's not working . It 's not ... Oh , my god , it 's not working . It 's not ... It 's not working , damn it . Come on . Come on . Five ... Four .. Three ... Two ... one . Lost her , captain . Diseaged from mother . Explain to me what just happened . I don 't know . I-it wasn 't me . Well , fix it . Fix this tub , or we 're all fucked . I 'll go find that vidlog and see if there 's anything on it that can help us . If all else fails , we 'll send out a distress signal . I don 't know if that 's going to work . It 's like all wave transmission devices have been scrambled , preventing any outgoing signals here . Well , unscramble it . No . If I die , this is definitely going down as the worst summer job I 've ever had . No . If I die , this is definitely going down as the worst summer job I 've ever had . Whoa , dude . Psychedelic . Man , it 's nothing but a bitch . That 's what it is . We find this big-ass salvage . Instead of there being some gold on this ship , instead of there being some gold on this ship , there 's nothing but some dead bodies . Relax , bro . No , you relax . Man , this ship ain 't nothing but a big-ass hearse . That 's what this is . Man , what you doin ' ? Man , I ain 't got no time to play around . Let 's go . Tranquilize , dude . Tranquilize , dude . One dead body 's enough for today , okay ? Bro , this is how they used to smuggle shit back in the day . Might find something . Bro , this is how they used to carry dead bodies back in the day . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! I cut my hand . That 's what your ass get . Damn it . Damn , that 's pretty deep . Looks pretty bad . Let 's see what we got here . Sand . Ain 't nothin but some damn sand . Think it 's worth something ? Man , sand ain 't worth nothin ' . Let 's try another one . You do it . Let 's try another one . You do it . Come on , man . I cut my hand . Come on , man . Look . You want me to open one ? Yeah . Here . I don 't need that . You want to open one ? Well , let 's open one . This is how I open it . You wanna snort some of this ? Just ' cause you don 't treasure a mind-bending substance the way I do doesn 't give you the right to make fun of my lifestyle . Man , shut the hell up . Man , shut the hell up . What exactly are you two doing ? Nothin ' . Doesn 't look like nothing to me . How about showing some respect for the dead ? Save your rhetoric , okay ? The professor needs you . I 'll be there in a second . Now . I said , a second . Are you coming ? Nah , I 'm gonna stay here and open a couple more of these . There 's got to be something here . I can 't believe there 's not . There 's got to be something here . I can 't believe there 's not . I 'm out of here . Whatever , dude . Sweet Jesus . May 30 , 2950 . We departed transylvania station last night at 2200 hours , and not one moment too soon . Transylvania ? Where the fuck is transylvania ? The morale of the crew seemed to sink minute by minute . But for double the usual credits , we could not turn down the last cargo run . We could not turn down the last cargo run . Why the urgent need to remove these remains to the carpathian galaxy , I do not know . Diplomatic problems with the locals , perhaps . What 's going on ? I don 't know . Come on . What the hell was that ? I 'll be right back . Hey ! Don 't leave me here ! Hey ! Don 't leave me here ! Don 't leave me here ! 187 ! What happened ? What happened , bro ? He , he , he ... He what ? What is it ? He , he , he ... He what ? He ... He 's out . Hummer , get him outta here . I 'll , uh ... I 'll have to set the leg . The only way to do that is to straighten it . Hummer , you 're gonna have to this manually . Leave it to the big black guy , huh ? Just do it . Cap , I can 't do this . Well , there 's no other way . Well , there 's no other way . No , thank you . He could lose his leg here . It 's just gonna have to happen . It will just be two of you wheelchair wheelie-poppin ' test tube babies on the crew . And , cap , I can live with that . I 'll do it . Hold him down . You do it yourself , wonder woman . Thanks . No sweat . Hey . How 's his leg ? His leg is going to be fine ... His leg is going to be fine ... Excuse me . Captain , you 're needed in the rec room . What were you two talking about ? Nothing . I saw you . Nothing , okay ? Listen , if there 's something wrong , we have the right to know . Listen , if there 's something wrong , we have the right to know . Don 't worry about it . You wanted to see me ? Have a look at his neck . What are they ? Well , they aren 't flea bites , but they are bites . Bites ? The puncture wounds are definitely teeth . Teeth ? Incisors , big ones . Are you sure ? Someone ... bit him ? Something . I never said the teeth were ... human . I never said the teeth were ... human . Hey ... Going somewhere , wheelie boy ? See you on the flip side . See you on the flip side . Bleah ! Oh , I 'm sorry . Did you hit me ? You 're going to have to do a whole lot better than that , cap 'n . Ah-ah-ah . Radical ! Hey ! Shit-for-brains ! Don 't move . I said , don 't move ! Aurora . Baby . It 's so nice to see you . Did I ever tell you how many times I 'd see you and want to ejaculate all over your bazongas ? Or of the times I stayed up late , high as a kite in a nongravitational atmosphere , while I stroked my anaconda while I stroked my anaconda and dreamed about your ... Snow white ass ? Take one more step , and I 'll blow your anaconda all over the ceiling . One . Bet ya that pussy 's sweeter than a honey bun . Two . When I 'm through , I 'm gonna pass you to the crew . Three ! Three ! You might as well get down on your knees . Four , you 're gonna end up dead on the floor . Shoot him , Aurora ! Five ! Ain 't none of y 'all bitches gettin ' outta here alive ! Oh , for god 's sake , Aurora , shoot him . For god 's sakes , Aurora , shoot him ! Shoot him ! Shoot him ! Wanna see what a real man tastes like ? Oh , shit . What the hell 's going on ? I heard some shooting . 187 went ballistic . He was out cold ! He tried to kill us . He was out cold ! He tried to kill us . He 's after Aurora . He wants to kill her . But I believe he wants to titty-fuck her first . This is so wrong . Let 's go . ♪ ... left somewhere . Master , you have summoned me ? Arise , my son . What is it you want of your humble and loyal servant ? You wish to please me ? Yes . Your wish ... Is my command . Kill them . Kill them all . Gladly . Gladly . Gladly ! Hey , cap , I can 't believe 187 's doing this , man . He 's always been my homie . Well , your homie tried to rip my throat out . Hey , cap , he ain 't never been violent . I ain 't messin ' with you . That dude got a heart of gold . I remember when we was kids ... Humvee . Yeah , cap ? Remember that " shutting the hell up " thing we talked about earlier ? Yeah . Why don 't you try doing that now . Yeah . Why don 't you try doing that now . Whatever helps you sleep , cap 'n . Whatever helps you sleep . Good evening , my dear . Who are you ? You are the most beautiful creature I 've ever seen . So soft , yet so ... Firm . Who are you ? What do you want ? Darkness . Infinite ... darkness . But what I want and what I need are ... Worlds ... apart . What I need ... Is blood . Is blood . I 'm fine . Just keep watch at the door . This needs stitches . You 're gonna get an infection . I 'll take my chances . Now , pick up a weapon and man the door . Please . Whatever . Whatever . See ? Nothing . See ? Nothing . Mina ! Leave her alone ! Leave her alone ! Leave her alone ! Leave her alone ! Oh . He got Mina . You okay ? Wait here . But ... Oh , bollocks . Stop firing ! It 's me ! Aurora ? I didn 't know it was your ass . So , have you seen 187 ? No , but I saw him . So you did see him ? No , him . Professor ! Oh . Captain . Oh , sorry , I ... I know . Okay . Tell us about him . Who ? We got company . His name is orlock . Count orlock of transylvania . Transylvania ? That 's where this ship comes from . How do you know that ? I found the vidlog . What else was on it ? I don 't know . What else was on it ? I don 't know . I started watching it when all the entertainment started . Go on . Transylvania is a planet in the remote carpathian system . It 's , um ... It 's a planet of vampires . Vampires ? So what the hell is a vampire ? It 's sort of like a man , only far more evil , if you can imagine that . You believe that shit ? You believe that shit ? His planet is dead . And according to him , there is nothing left . It 's a wasteland . He is the last one of his kind . How did he get on this ship ? He paid to have the ship pick up a bunch of coffins , I guess , and he was in one of them . And ... what does he want ? Dinner . What ? We woke him up , and he 's hungry . And ... he wants to eat ... us ? He needs blood . Our blood ? He needs blood . Our blood ? That 's how he survives . He lives on blood . And with what happened to 187 , I believe that whoever he bites will become a vampire , too . This vampire dude , he 's a brother ? No , Humvee , he is not a black man . Well , excuse me for sayin ' , all this bloodsucking stuff , that 's some white people shit , right ? I 'm going back to the mother , and I 'm going home . Uh , Humvee , that ... That could be a problem . Uh , Humvee , that ... That could be a problem . Mother 's gone . Excuse me ? She took off on her own ... Actually , he did that . So you 're telling me I 'm trapped on this ship with a bloodsucking vampire ? Get this tub up and running . We gotta find a way to stay alive . And you ... What the fuck are you doing ? Back off , cap ! How do you know all this information ? He told me . Why is that ? I don 't know . Why is that ? I don 't know . Why , Aurora ? I don 't know ! Hey , cap , you need to back down , or I 'm gonna bust a cap in your ass . Don 't be stupid , Humvee . Look at what happened to 187 . How come nothing happened to her ? Yeah , Aurora , why nothing did happen to you ? I don 't know . Maybe I 'm just not his taste . Stop lying ! Hey ! Get off me ! Hey , cap , ain 't no time to get fresh , man ! I was looking for bite marks . 187 had bite marks on his neck . I was looking for bite marks . 187 had bite marks on his neck . Captain , we have to get back to the main deck if I 'm to get this thing started . Tie her up . No , I don 't think ... Then don 't ! I 've heard enough from you already . Let 's go . This is ridiculous . Get your hands up there . Stop ! There 's something there . I saw something , captain . What ? I don 't know . Well , I did . Honest , captain , I did . You saw I didn 't have any bite marks , and you 're gonna need all the help you can get . Maybe you didn 't get bit on your neck . Maybe you got bit someplace else . Well , then untie me , and you can take off my clothes and look me over . Now I know you 're playin tricks on me . You 're not going to want me all tied up when he comes a-callin ' . I 'm trying to help you . I 'm looking out for you , Humvee . And you don 't want a chance to see me naked ? And you don 't want a chance to see me naked ? My mama didn 't raise no fool , girl . I know as soon as I let you up , you gonna be all vampire on my black ass . And since I didn 't get bit , you 'll be the one who got the chance to investigate every inch of me for no good reason whatsoever . I think it 's worth the risk . Don 't you ? You 're just wasting your breath . It 's going in one ear , out the other . There 's nothing wrong with me ! Blah , blah , blah , blah . Blah , blah , blah , blah . The ... Fission reactor 's nearly three-quarters full . That 's good . And in working order . Now , if I can just get the protonic ignition activated the protonic ignition activated and the hyperspeed sequence rerouted , I should be able to ... I 'm the man , Van Helsing . Tell me I 'm the man . You 're the man . Now tell me why you 're the man . I can fly this thing . You 're the man . Let 's plot a course . What 's the closest place you can get us to ? The kesselring system . Make it so . Aye , aye , captain . I think we 're moving . The legless wonder came through for the team . Now , that 's what I 'm talking about . Score one for hope . I have to go to the bathroom . I have to go to the bathroom . Yeah , sure , like I 'm gonna fall for that one . Humvee , I have to go to the bathroom . I really do . Well , then go . Don 't be such a moron . All right . Let 's see what we can dig up on vampires . Uh , valium , uh , valium , valkyries ... Ah , vampires . Contact . What do ya got ? There 's a plethora of information here , captain . Good . What do you want to know ? How to kill ' em . Ah , of course . Whoa . Take a look at this , captain . " Dracula . " Count Dracula , " count Dracula , " otherwise known as ... Orlock . " Aurora 's friend . That 's impossible . You ... he wants you . You 're in here . What ? " Doctor Van Helsing . Born 1847 . Vampire killer . " Vampire killer ? The chances of your lineage matching up in this history the chances of your lineage matching up in this history are far too astronomical to contemplate . There 's got to be a connection . That 's crazy . Van Helsing could be your great-great - , many times great , grandfather . This could be a revenge situation . He could be killing us just to get to you . Calm down . He 's going to kill us , captain . Calm down . It 's just a coincidence . Coincidence ? Yeah , a coincidence . Find me a way to kill this son of a bitch . Aye , aye , captain . Let me in . Please let me in . 187 ? Hummer , you gotta help me , bro . Let me in , please ! Humvee , please , man ! I don 't feel so good . Are you crazy ? He 's lying ! You gotta help me , bro . He 's gonna kill me . Humvee , no . Come on , Hummer . You know how they treat us brothers . Dude , they don 't care about us . But we said we 'd always stick together , right ? Please , Hummer . I 'm gonna die if you don 't help me . No , Humvee ! No ! He 's lying to you . Don 't . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . To hell with you . No ! Whoa , dude . Suddenly I feel ... brand-new . Ain 't that a bummer , Hummer ? Humvee ! Captain ! Keep working . What about me ? What about me ? Bugger . You done pissed me off , fool . Dude , I cannot believe you fell for the " we brothers got to stick together " routine . You fell for the " we brothers got to stick together " routine . You know , that 's been the downfall of many a black man . Shut your little punk ass up ! Scared , homie ? Please ! See ? If you had stayed and helped me try to find me some smoke , this might not be happening . Bitch , you need some professional help , man , for your habit , and I 'm just the big dog gonna give it to you . And I 'm just the big dog gonna give it to you . 187 . I ain 't playing with you no more , 187 ! Do I have to spell it out to you guys ? You cannot kill 187 ! Stop ... Wasting ... Bullets ! I don 't believe this shit . It 's like you idiots don 't want to listen . I ... Am a vampire , and ain 't nobody bad like me . Whoo-oh ! I feel ... fucking invincible ! The high I get from being a vampire is even better than where I got to go with that comptonian weed we in ... Is even better than where I got to go with that comptonian weed we in ... Comptonia , asshole . Yeah , yeah . You remember that , bro . We were high for days , swimming in comptonian ass , boning so many hos , my nuts were swollen for a week . Here . Try that shit ... again . You are really beginning to annoy me , and I never did like you , Van Helsing . You always condescended to me , man , as if because , you know , I was a little more laid back than you . You were on a higher intellectual plane , and I was never full of that shit ! A pool stick . Un-fucking-believable . Sorry , bro . I told you I wasn 't playing . Excuse me . I hate to interrupt , but could you please untie me now ? Give me one good reason . Because he didn 't bite me ... anywhere . Because he didn 't bite me ... anywhere . You can look for yourself . She already tried that one on me before . Been there , done that . Uhh , please . You still haven 't explained to me why , when he had his chance , he didn 't bite you . You stay put . Okay . Fine . You win . I 'm listening . I 'm not what you think I am . Okay , what are you ? I 'm a proteus 4 . What did you just say ? I work for the nwc . You 're a narc ? You 've been under surveillance for the last three moon cycles . You 've been under surveillance for the last three moon cycles . You ... and your crew . Man , this just gets better and better . She 's a snooper-bot . What 's up with you ? What 's so damn funny ? Untie her . What ? Are you losing your head , man ? That 's nwc . She 's a narc , man . She 's 5-0 . That 's why she was pointing out the laws in every damn town . No , I should walk over here and put a bullet in your hard drive ! That 's what I should do ! Lose the attitude . That 's what I should do ! Lose the attitude . When we let her up , she 's gonna try and take us down . Yeah , and she 's probably our best weapon against this orlock . What are you talkin ' about ? He doesn 't want her , Hummer . Why the fuck not ? Because she 's a robot . He wants blood . She 's got no blood , remember ? You better be right on this . You could have at least told me you were an automatic . Would it have made any difference ? I 'm watching you . Damn . Damn . Oh ! Almost got your butt killed , fool ! Sorry . Pick him up . Uh , what happened ? Where 's 187 ? He 's dead . Dead ? How ? A pool cue . Pool cue ? Yeah , man . Yeah , man . I had to drive a pool cue through his heart . Of course , a pool cue . It 's wooden , right ? According to ancient folklore , there are a few methods by which to disenable these vampires . Like ? Driving a wooden stake through their heart is apparently very effective . Yeah . But it has to be organic wood , not this synthetic wood product they 're passing off as real these days . And it must be through the heart . A pool cue ? Precisely . 2950 , they were still using organic wood for cues . 2950 , they were still using organic wood for cues . And ? Hm ? You said there were other ways . Crucifixes . They don 't like crucifixes . That thing that was in the dead captain 's hand ? The plus sign ? Exactly . But what they really hate is sunlight . You mean we can tan this bitch to death ? In layman 's terms , abso-bloody-lutely . If they 're exposed to constant sunlight , they 'll go up in a ball of flame and ash- - boom . End of story . In case you haven 't noticed , we 're in deep space . End of story . In case you haven 't noticed , we 're in deep space . Not much sun . Mm-hmm . Not true . We could turn this thing around , head straight for halbron , slingshot off her rings ... Twin suns . She 's right . Turn this tub around right now . What are we gonna do till we reach the sun ? Find us some more pool cues . Right . Ugh . That 's disgusting . I don 't get it . What ? Why 'd you do that ? Do what ? React like that to a dead body . I thought you things were programmed to be emotionless . I 've done exactly what I 've been programmed to do . Let 's just look for those pool cues . Let 's just look for those pool cues . Fine . Hey ! I found one . Now there 's two . How long before we reach the sun ? Approximately 13 hours . I hate the number 13 . Can 't you make this thing go any faster ? I can 't . Metal fatigue . If we push this old girl any harder , she 'll bleed fuel and die . Like you and I will , if you don 't make this thing go faster . I 'm trying . All right ? I 'm trying . Try harder . I bet you he 's hiding in one of these coffins . No , thanks . I don 't gamble , except with my choice of lovers lately . I thought we agreed it was going to be casual , nothing serious . I thought we agreed it was going to be casual , nothing serious . Oh , did you think I was serious ? You know , for a computer , you sure are bitchy . It 's all in the programming , baby . I 'd like to get a hold of your programmer . When I get it open , stab him in the heart . Like you know where that is . Just do it . Okay . Okay , move on to the next . Next one . We 're going to die before we get to the twin suns , aren 't we ? Maybe you won 't . I mean , you can run . Sooner or later , the time 's gonna come , and ... a wheel 's gonna get caught , or I 'll fall out of my chair again . Mina ? Do it . Get Humvee . No , I don 't want to leave ... Go ! No , I don 't want to leave ... Go ! What are you waiting for ? I 'm a Van Helsing . Van Helsing ? That 's right . I come from a long line of vampire killers . Your ancestors were vampire killers . Your ancestors were vampire killers . You , on the other hand , are destined for far greater things , my boy . Namely , dinner . You 're going to have to do better than that . For more than a thousand years , my kind have burned in shame for the vampires slain at the hands of your namesake . I alone have waited here for centuries , sensing , knowing you were destined to come . And now that you 're finally here ... And now that you 're finally here ... Open this hatch ! Let me in ! Van Helsing is in trouble . He needs your help ! I ain 't falling for that shit twice . What if it 's true ? Open this door , you idiots ! Go away ! Go away ! Listen to me ! Van Helsing needs your help now ! Well , you go help him ! Humvee , come on ! Nobody 's home . Damn it . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . Shut the hell up , now ! We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all doing to ... Where 're you going ? I 'd rather face that vampire than listen to your sorry ass . I 'd rather face that vampire than listen to your sorry ass . Wait ! Oh . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . Aurora ? Humvee . Where is he ? Cargo bay seven . Humvee ? Humvee , where are you ? Humvee ? We 're all going to die . We 're all going to die . Humvee . Humvee ? Oh , my god . Oh ... Why die ? Why die ? Please ... Please don 't kill me . Kill you ? I 'm not going to kill you . Take my hand ... And walk with me ... For all eternity . Walk ? That 's right . Come with me , come with me , and I 'll set you free . Come , my boy . Come . Stand up . Help me . Oh , my god . Help me . Captain ! Take it easy , man . Try not to speak . Captain , hang in there . Try to be still . Don 't move . Cap . He ... wants ... you ! Humvee ? Pin the bitch ! Where that other freak at ? Let 's not stick around and find out . Stop . What is it ? You wait here . No way . He doesn 't want your blood . He 's still scary . I hear you . Professor . Professor ? Don 't . What the hell ? How did you know ? I didn 't . Orlock . I 'll pull ! Harder ! Harder , Humvee ! Pull ! Pull ! If I told you once , woman , I 've told you twice . Always put out the " do not disturb " sign . Women . Now what ? Once we reach sunlight , we 're gonna veer away where we won 't get no meltdown . Can you fly this thing ? No . I thought you could do everything ? I was programmed for human emotion . That doesn 't mean I 'm the bionic woman , you know . Any ideas ? I just asked you that . Damn , I should have went to flight school . Yeah . There is one good thing , though . What 's that ? We may not be going back to earth , but neither is orlock . That 's real talk . That 's real talk . So , how long ? How long for what ? Till we reach the sun . Twelve hours . Humvee ? Mm-hmm . Did I ever tell you that ... Tell me what ? I wasn 't always a narc , you know . You weren 't ? Mm-mm . Not until they " upgraded " my program . Not until they " upgraded " my program . Upgraded your program ? Before that , I was a proteus 3.2 , p.B. P.B. ? Pleasure-bot . I 've heard of those . I ain 't never had enough credits . Well , then , what 're you waiting for ? You 've only got a couple of hours till the end of your world , and I 'm off the clock . Bingo ! Must be the front row . Ain 't gotta tell me twice . Come on , girl . Ain 't gotta tell me twice . Come on , girl . My obligation has become greater than the safety of the ship . My obligation has become greater than the safety of the ship . I see now that I must sacrifice the demeter , and myself , to prevent this terror from reaching earth . And that 's what I 'm talkin ' about .

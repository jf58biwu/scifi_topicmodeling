 Previously on Farscape . A relationship is based on trust . I didn 't want to tell you about the pregnancy until I was sure . Sure you were pregnant , or sure who the father was ? In view of the continuing danger we face in Peacekeeper space , I 'm reluctantly forced to consider traveling into Tormented Space . Can 't be as bad as some of the places we 've been lately . It can . Chiana : What 's he doin ' here ? He wants asylum . Asylum ? I gave my word that he would not be harmed . Why did you come here ? To safeguard John Crichton , amongst other things . D 'Argo : Can you trust Scorpius ? More today than yesterday . Why ? And now , on Farscape . Highly abnormal . Ugh ! Even I can 't eat that much . Is that really your third helping ? Fifth . Highly abnormal . Highly effective . Aeryn : So , the advantages of only eating ten times a cycle are ... Sikozu : Not eating all the other times . Pilot : Captain ? Pilot . Moya has asked me to once again convey ... Okay , stop right there . We 're aware that you think this planet is a pit , an outpost of nothing . Rygel : Their food 's overcooked undercooked , and not worth cooking . Makes Noranti 's food seem edible . Pilot , how bad is it ? Without additional zyntian filtration , the electrostatic impulses from surrounding radiation sources will drive her mad . Moya has not had peaceful rest since we entered the Tormented Space . D 'Argo : This is the only planet we 've found whose mechanics are aware of Leviathans . They can get the job done . But when , Captain ? Sikozu : When their doctor certifies that none of us has Space Madness . ( audible forced breath ) After you . He has already certified free of , uh , transmissible celestial dementia ? We 're calling it Space Madness . Scarran ancestry , however , disqualifies visitation to Khurtanan . ( growling softly ) Hit the road . Space invader . Stillness . I 'm sure that Pilot told you that Moya 's hull protects us from radiation . Good . Space Madness is so feared on this planet that there are no exceptions . Now for the neurologic brain scan . ( whirring ) Hmm ... Hey look , I know you guys lie and all , but this is not gonna hurt too bad , is it ? Not a bit . ( yelling ) No , no , no . No . This food is dren . I 'll agree to that . Ah . If you 'd have held your scream out for one more microt , I would have won the pool . Oh , too bad . Anything edible ? No . - No . Remarkable . So , Doc Snot commed ahead giving us the all-clear and Pilot says that the mechanic is on approach . Wow , that 's crap . ( sneezing ) D 'Argo : Know what ? I think I might be allergic to something here . Gratification at meeting you all . Did you enjoy the repast ? Well , it 's the first thing I 've had in a while that doesn 't taste like chicken . Kind of reminds me of a big bowl of Alpo I once ate . Ha , perhaps when you visit the planet you 'll discover better nourishment . D 'Argo : Uh , we won 't be visiting the planet , Doctor . As soon as your mechanic fixes our ship , we 'll be leaving . ( sneezing ) ( sneezing ) ( chuckling ) I risk to differ , Captain . Oh , did I forget to mention not to share the Qatal Mollusks ? They 're to be eaten whole . Should the flesh be divided among different stomachs , ( chuckling ) the food poisoning that results is fatal . What did you do ? Initiated the first half of our business arrangement . Bring one quarter million currency pledges each to my office , and I will cure you . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Know what ? Why don 't we just shoot you ? It does sound presumptuous , I know , but I am the only one that can cure you . The weapons will only cause the mechanic to resist the modifications your ship requires . Suppose we tell him what you did . Well , he will not believe you . He cannot help you . And I will double my price . Care to call my bluff ? Hmm ? Do not delay payment . Your symptoms will greatly mimic the uncontrolled disorders associated with space madness , a disease they shoot on sight for . Doctor . As I communicated , clean health for all . No threat of affective illness . At the moment . ( sneezing ) ( farting ) ( groaning ) ( chuckling ) ( laughing ) Hey . Glad to see ya . ( groaning ) ( sneezing ) ( groaning ) As you can see , we 're ... we 're all excited by it all . Rygel : If you 'll excuse me . ( groaning and farting ) D 'Argo : Chiana . Excuse me . Did you eat any of the mollusks ? No . Good , okay . I want you to put this mechanic to work but I want you to stay with him . He goes nowhere without you . Okay . Where do you need to go ? The zyntian filter must be installed in a primary sensory nerve conduit . Sikozu : Any Neural Cluster will do , once we have diverted the synaptic flow . And , um ... I can tell Pilot how to do that ... ( groaning ) Right . Come on . Right , y 'all have fun now . Watch out for those hooligan trill bats . They 're killers . Aeryn : What the frell is going on here ? Every time Rygel vents , I ... vent . And every time Sputnik pulls a face , I get major league cramps . I 'm digesting a large meal that should not be affecting you . Well , it does . Is this a side effect of the Day-Glo clams ? It must be . D 'Argo and I both ate the purple mollusks , and every time he sneezes I feel it . Rygel and I had the green one . Somehow it 's linked us . ( passing gas ) We have to find a cure very quickly . Okay . Let 's go down to the planet and have a chat with our doctor . Analyze the food . If you find a cure , comm us immediately . So we can chop his head off . I 'll need various bodily samples from each of you . ( hawking ) Thank you . Next . Are you sure ? Absolutely . How long will this take ? Couple of arns at the most . Why are you staring at me ? Well , maybe I think you 're cute . Think whatever you want , but I 'm just here to do a job . I just wanna see that you don 't hurt Moya . Time to bypass the synapses . Pilot , we need to cut off power to this Cluster . Diverting now . No , it 'd be more efficient if you simply ... I do not need your help . ( powering down ) Dr. Tumii will be back shortly . Well , we 'd like to see him now . Nothing I can do . Damn , this place could use some air-con . Where the hell is Sikozu ? In a sauna ? Don 't complain . You 're not feeling three overfull stomachs . Hmm ... Ah . ( hiccups ) Okay . This is new . It 's not me , it 's definitely her . ( hiccups ) That 's all for today . Ah . ( hiccuping ) Killing me kills you . May I speak ? No . Cure first , speak later . Oh , put those away . I promise you , I can 't be forced to cure you . And the cure is of my own devising . You won 't find it elsewhere . Let me explain the Qatal Mollusk . Please don 't . We give up . We 'll pay . ( sniffling ) Each mollusk harbors one colony of neurally linked bacteria and each colony acts as one organism . So much so , that if the mollusk is halved , its bacteria alternately transmit each half 's sensations to the other half . Why ? Who cares ? Take the money . Cure us . Now that the bacteria have colonized your bodies , they 're communicating your emotional states to , uh , force you to merge . The problem is you are not mollusks . That 's never been a problem for us before . It is now . Your bodies , unlike the mollusk halves , can never merge . And so your symptoms worsen and eventually the strain kills you . All right , we understand . Fix it . We 'll pay double if you shut up . ( chuckles ) And I 'll break your neck if you don 't . Cure us all . Now . I will . But I am down to my last mollusk , and each cure requires the same type as was ingested . So get more . More being delivered in a few arns . Until then , I can only cure whoever ate the purple mollusk . That 'd be me . Both : I hate you . ( humming a song ) Oh ... oh ... Oh , oh , oh ... When this is finished , you 'll mix it with the other linked patient 's urine and then you orally ingest . No way . I am not drinking the old woman 's urine . ( gasping ) ( exhales ) D , what 's up ? Nothing , it 's , uh ... it 's Noranti , she ... Is she in pain ? ( gasping ) It 's ... it 's the opposite . Ah , oh ... Tumii : She 's experiencing intense pleasure ? Oh ! Very intense . Um , John ... do you think you could ... Whoa , no , no , don 't come near me when you 're feeling like that . ( breathing heavily ) Come on , D 'Argo . Just fight it . D , think about baseball . Math . Isosceles triangle . Rusty razor blades . Gravel . ( shrieking ) Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Oh ! ( gasps ) She lost it . ( crashes ) ( shrieks ) This will give more lasting relief . Divide , urinate , exchange , ingest . You and the linked one must then press bare flesh to bare flesh , so the bacteria can migrate . How much bare flesh ? Hands will suffice . You see , the cure unbinds the bacteria from your cells and tricks the colony into ... Crichton : One more word of technobabble and I 'm gonna cut your tongue out . D 'Argo you wanna go check it out ? I 'm afraid the boy may be ruined for life . I 'm almost jealous . And if this doesn 't work , you 're dead . With all respect , so are you . Mekken : Bioscan 's negative so far , but how can you travel in something so alive ? All the filthy bacteria . Moya is quite hygienic . She is self disinfecting . She is female ? Oh , yes . But only controlled by Pilot , a male , of course . Ah , okay . That 's not so bad . And there never has been a case of Space Madness aboard this ship . Oh , you 're lucky . We 've had to terminate three cases in the last half cycle . An outbreak ? I guess so . I thought it had gone . Three cases out of the blue . They were good men , too . Real shame . Oh , indeed . All male ? That 's what makes it a real shame . ( buzzer sounds ) Ah , I believe the mollusks have arrived . Arrived in less than 30 minutes . - Finally . Don 't forget to tip the driver . Son of a bitch . Vanished . Lie still , don 't move . ( grunting ) Who is the doctor ? Oh , plainly not you . ( panting ) Did you see who shot me ? Not her face . She disappeared . But you 're certain she was female ? - Mm-hmm . We are all in serious difficulty . " We " ? Yes . I 'm afraid I can 't cure you . Go on . Take it . Drink it . Why do you hesitate ? Why do you think ? Would you rather die than drink it ? ( sighing ) : Okay . So we should be touching while we drink this . Oh , so you said . Um , bare skin to bare skin . Ah , ah , ah , ah , ah . Not that much bare skin . But I ... I would have thought that the more contact ... No , the doctor would have said , you know . ( whistles ) Oh , yes . Less skin . ( exhales heavily ) Here 's to ya . ( inhales sharply ) Did it work ? Dunno . Test it . Okay . ( grunts ) Oh ! Was that absolutely necessary ? Oh , one little pop . ( gasps ) ( yelps ) Oh ! Oh , I just got a fright . I ... ( sighs ) I didn 't feel anything . It 's working . John , the cure seems to be working . That 's great news , D. I hate you even more . Tumii : Certainly it 's working . Just maintain contact . For how long ? Until you feel an oily sensation , which signifies the bacteria have all precipitated out . No more than a few arns . Arns ? What happens if they break contact before ... that ? The bacteria will recolonize in their bodies and the symptoms recur and eventually , they 'll die . It 's not gonna happen . Aeryn : Rygel , you and Sikozu get down here quickly . Right . Oh ! Do you know I 've been looking for this opportunity for so long . I 've wanted to get you alone . There are so many things I don 't know about you . You know , Doc , you might wanna give her a reason not to kill you . Oh ... To cure you , I need Qatal Mollusks , and I can no longer get them . Why not ? Credit problems ? Let me explain the sociopolitical situation on Khurtanan . As you may know , females are oppressed here . but there is a resistance movement planning a violent coup to seize power . Girl power . So what ? They possess the only Qatal Mollusks on this planet . ( chuckling ) : They employ them to eliminate certain males in power . So why use the mollusks ? Secrecy . The Qatal symptoms are not known on this planet . They are mistaken for Space Madness . Yeah , and anyone with Space Madness is put down like a rabid dog . We got that part . Correct . But during an autopsy on one of the victims , I saw the real cause . I found out who was responsible and I made a deal . My silence for some of the mollusks . So you use them for extortion and they use them for coup by clam . We still don 't care . Apart from the obvious , why did they just try to kill you ? I assume that their big takeover attempt must be imminent . Possibly they 're afraid I might expose them . All I can do is refund two-thirds of your currency . Oh , no . You 're going to tell me where the females are . Um ... I thought you might need some help with your equipment . I 'm fine . Sure you are ... ( grunting ) sister ? You can 't tell Mekken . He 'll kill me . Oh ? Well , maybe I 'll kill you . ( blow lands ) ( groaning in pain ) What have I done to you ? I told you , I 'm just here to do a job . Yeah ? Well , then why the sex change , hmm ? I don 't think you 're here to help us . I think you 're here to spy on us . To make sure we eat those frelling mollusks ! I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm here to help you . Fixing your Leviathan . Then what 's with this ? What 's with the change ? Because women on my world aren 't allowed to do this sort of work . Sure . ( grunts ) You don 't believe me , I 'll go . Get someone else . Some male to stop your ship from going mad . All right , all right , all right , all right . Okay , maybe ... maybe you 're not lying . No maybe . These female revolutionaries run a club to entertain men ? Very popular with rich and powerful males , including governing officials . Crichton : Then one night , they chop some mollusk up into the hors d 'oeuvres and instant coup . I should probably go alone . No , no , no , I got it . Currency . Do we have the antidote ? Just going for that . Oh well , hurry up . This place reeks of antiseptic . Sikozu , we have a mission . I 'm happy to go . Jirl power . - Hmm ? Girl ... girl power ! Would you quit speaking English ? ! Aeryn , be careful ! Considering we 're linked . I 'd better go before the females try again . I 'm going to miss this planet . ( muffled talking ) Ho 'Ock : Anybody here ? Dr. Tumii ? He 's tied up right now . So what ? So , uh , why don 't you have a seat and wait your turn ? Tell the doctor that Ho 'Ock is here . Now . ( grunting ) What 's all the commotion ? Who are you ? Dr. Rygel . Tumii 's at the colon convention . Uh , what seems to be the problem ? Hmm ? My zergenbobs are playing up again . ( clicking tongue in sympathy ) That 's what you get for neglecting them . Take off your clothes . Here ? Yes . For some preventive bloodletting . Most anyone can benefit from the removal of one excess bodily fluid or another . Inflamed zergenbobs , you say ? Well , I think we should take a look , hmm ? Take care of yourself . Hmm . What the hell 's the matter with you ? I 'm operating . ( sighs ) ( sinister chuckling ) ( engines roaring and hissing ) You looking for work ? No . We don 't open for another arn . We 'd like to talk to Selva . Who ? Your boss . You claim to know her ? Sikozu : No . But we have heard that she 's trying to improve conditions on this planet for females . It 's a worthy cause . Causes need currency . So we 'd like to discuss a business deal . Not interested . We 'd prefer to hear that from Selva . No , you wouldn 't . Sikozu , are you up for this ? ( grunts ) ( groaning ) Crichton , I think the girls are in trouble ! That 's brilliant , Holmes . ( grunts ) I am Selva . You wanted to speak to me . Not if this is how you treat your friends . Why don 't you untie us ? You 're not my friends . Yes , you 're right . That 's a good point . We 're not your friends . We 've come to buy something from you at whatever the price . Two Qatal Mollusks . Even if they 're telling the truth , we can 't take that chance . Of course not . But killing them will only cure whoever it is they 're linked with . Leaving them free to take revenge . However , if we keep our captives alive ... Then their partners will be drawn here . Where they can all die at once . Ain 't no way in hell I 'm wearing that . Have I spent an arn shopping for nothing ? We have to get into that club . Why don 't we just go as we are ? The elite male clientele are all known , and know one another . Therefore , we can 't go as males . Well , I ain 't going as Maid Marian and ... look at that . That is not a slimming color . Black is a slimming color . Maybe , maybe if it was black , but uh-uh . I wear that color all the time . Look , stay here and die from the mollusks . I 'll go alone . ( exotic dance music playing ) Told you we 'd get in . You say that like it 's a good thing . One down , three to go . Get in , get the girls , get the clams , get out . Over here . Keep your head down . Rygel : We need to blend in . Blend in ? Hell , when we got here the clocks stopped . We couldn 't blend in on Butt-Ugly Night . Whadda we got here ? Oh , I love a powerful woman . You put your hand on my ass again , and I will kill you . Mujombre : You 're the first one who 's ever guessed that I wasn 't really a man . Chiana : It wasn 't a guess . I know a male when I see one . Pretending to be male isn 't so bad . How do you stand covering up who you are ? Men get treated better . Well there must be lots of places you could go where you don 't have to pretend . My home planet 's a lot worse than this one . I ran away a long time ago . Never regretted it for a microt . Khurtanan 's my home . And I won 't have to masquerade forever . Sooner or later , women will take power . You . Put down your tools and strip . No . Hey , leave her alone . Stand clear , or you 'll both die . Come on . ( Scorpius growls ) ( snapping neck ) Mujombre : You killed Mekken . Resume your work . Let 's dance . What 's the problem ? You don 't talk ? ( effeminate voice ) Darling , I don 't dance . I do . Pilot : Crichton isn 't responding . His Comms may be turned off . Or he could be incapacitated , by the Qatar Mollusks . Perhaps we should contact the planet 's authorities ? And if they inquire after Mekken ? Well , what can we do ? You ... can do nothing . ( humming ) Have their better halves arrived ? Can 't tell . Too many new faces . Give me 50 microts , then cut off one of their fingers . That should tell us . Isn 't this nice ? With the right partner , I could do it all night . I really don 't think I 'm the right partner for you . Ho 'Ock : I do . You know , much as I love a man in a uniform ... Shouldn 't you be on duty , or something ? I am on duty . Ah , this looks promising . Yes . Excellent . You . Not her . ( grunting ) Is something wrong ? Headache . No , not her ! ( gasping ) Are you volunteering ? Yes . - No . Leave her alone . - Shut up , Aeryn ! I brought her here . She has nothing to do with this . - Shut up , Aeryn ! Shut up ! - Fine . ( scream ) ( grunting ) Are you all right ? ( strangled gasp ) : Yeah , I am . Cramps . Bloating . ( strangled gasp ) I 'm a little hot . I could ... I could use a drink . To the bar , shall we ? ( short , quiet breaths ) Selva : Didn 't work . No one reacted . ( dance music plays ) Wait there . ( quietly ) : Pervert . Ryg ? How you making out ? I 've got the Mollusks . What about the girls ? - Don 't know . If they 're here , I can 't find them . Well , we gotta find ' em fast . That 's your job . I did my part . I 'm leaving . You 're not running out on me ? I can 't help it . I 'm overwhelmed with dread . But that 's the clams talking . And worse still , my limbs are starting to go numb . ( whimpering ) - Damn it , Rygel , The Doc told us what that meant . ( quivering ) Should I try the other one ? It 's too late . She 's already entered the final phase . The link will get more unstable until she and her partner die . Oh ! If we 're not cured soon , we 're dead . You get the girls . I 'll get these clams to the doctor . It 's antidote time . ( wheezing ) Rygel ? Rygel ? Pilot : Scorpius , consuming the remnants of the discarded mollusks seems a risky plan . Are you certain that once you 've linked with the others , you can endure the symptoms and delay their deterioration ? Certain , no . Confident , yes . Pilot : I tried once more to contact them , but there 's still no response from ... Proknoth ! ( sighs ) Noranti ... I 'm really thirsty . Oh , it 's gorgeous . ( giggles ) But I don 't want any more . Let 's get this filter in place . That ought to do it . Pilot ? Restore the primary path and see if it 's all working . Restoring now . ( whirring ) ( powering up ) Uncanny . It 's so quiet . The filter works perfectly . Moya and I sincerely thank you . You gonna be all right ? On Khurtanan ? Yeah . - Sure . Name change , new identity . ( sighs ) I 've done it before . I 've got friends who 'll help . I 'll probably wind up with an even better job . You 're a frelling optimist . Hard to be a revolutionary if you 're not . Crichton : No , really . I should go powder my face . Mm-hmm . - Oh . I think you look beautiful just as you are . No , you don 't . - Mmm , yes , I do . The moment I saw you , in the doctor 's office . ( pained quivering ) You couldn 't fool me for a microt . Not with face like that . All right . Here 's the deal . I lost a bet . There 's no need to lie to me . If you treat me nicely , I might not even have to arrest you . Arrest ? ( spasmodic grunting ) Dressing up is not a crime . Yes , it is . But impersonating a doctor is an even worse one . Central Registry shows no record of your off-world friend . Who is he , and where is he ? This won 't help you without your linked partner , you know ? So , why don 't you , uh , set me ... free ? Shut up ! Work ! There 's only one thing I like more than dancing . Hmm ? Interrogations . Long , hard interrogations . Oh , God . ( spasmodic quivering ) ( thudding ) You 'll tell me now or you 'll tell me later . ( abrupt gasping ) I 'm told it 's a terrible death . ( shuddering ) Wish I could make it quicker . ( laughs ) ( shuddering ) ( spastic groaning ) Ooh . Get your hands ... ( screaming ) My ... my nose ! You bit off my nose ! There 's plenty left . Now , get back to work . ( quick , shallow breathing ) Don 't be shy . ( barks ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( sighs ) I thought we were done . What happened ? I do not know . Why did you volunteer your finger ? Do your appendages reattach ? Tell me of anything suspicious at all . ( taking a breath ) Hi . Don 't ask . It was Rygel 's idea . He 's got the clams . We gotta figure out a way to get out of here . All the exits are guarded . Maybe something I can do . Hurry . Excuse me , ladies . Can I have your attention ? Do any of you have ... - Give me that . ... one of these under your skirt ? Now . Aeryn ! Yeah ! Girl power ! ( panicked chatter ) ( screaming ) That 's it . Just one more bite . Mmm , mmm . Oh , good . Oh , thank you for preparing the cures . I 'll leave this mollusk in the garbage ... outside . But it will be consumed by drozil flies or a wild flibisk . You can 't do that to me . I risk to differ . Mmm . Nice mollusk . What 's that ? One more mouthful ? Hmm . Oh . Oh ! Look at that . Isn 't that amazing ? Now that , we study . No , that we will throw away . Everyone , the cure works . Ours is finished . D , how long did yours take ? Noranti : No time at all . Frelling forever . Both : Three arns . Three arns ? - Oh , that 's not that long . For some . Crichton : Well , put your hands together and feel the power . Yeah ! Out with the evil spirits ! Give me your hand , Ryg . Go away . I 'm hungry . You 're not eating anything until we are completely separated . Sikozu : The antidote has already dissolved our emotional linkages . I don 't want to take any chances . Rygel : I , uh , hate to bring this up , but Scorpius ate the mollusks , as well . Yes . To link with the four of us and temporarily override our symptoms . We would be dead by now if he had not . ( grunting ) ( panting )

WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STERILIZE THE ENTIRE PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VIRUS DOESN 'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET OUT AGAIN . MARKUS IS GOING TO LEAVE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE BEHIND TO HELP OUT . BESIDES , I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT MY NOTES AND ANY INFORMATION PERTAINING TO VALHALLA 'S MILITARY CAMPAIGN IS SECURED .

TRYING TO SAY I TALK TOO MUCH ? BECAUSE WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT . JEREMIAH ? JEREMIAH ... JEREMIAH ? SO WHAT NOW ? MARKUS WAS BEGINNING TO PUT TOGETHER A NEW ALLIANCE WITH THEO AND SOME OF THE OTHER LEADERS . THEY WERE CAPTUREDBY VALHALLA SECTOR . ONCE MY DAD HAS INFORMATION ON WHERE THEY 'RE BEING HELD , WE GO GET THEM OUT . I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE A REST . COMPARED TO THIS WEEK , IT 'D BE LIKE A VACATION . HOW BAD CAN IT BE ? STILL NO WORD FROM VALHALLA SECTOR ? NOTHING . DO YOU THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED ? NO . THAT PLACE IS FREAKIN ' IMPERVIOUS . YOU CAN 'T TOUCH ' EM . SO WHAT 'S GOING ON ?

NOW I 'M MOVING AHEAD , THROUGH THE PAST . * I CAN 'T LET GO * I 'M HOLDING HOPE SO TIGHT * IT 'S HARD TO BREATHE WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD FALLS * * I 'M GONNA PUT THE STARS BACK BACK UP IN THE SKY * * LET THEM ALL JUST SHINE DOWN I 'M GONNA TRY * * I BELIEVE WE 'LL FIND THE WORLD TOGETHER * * THROUGH YOUR EYES * THAT 'S ALL I CAN SEE * I BELIEVE WE 'RE LOOKING AT FOREVER * * IN A WORLD WHERE WE CAN BE FREE * * I BELIEVE * STOP IT ! LET 'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT . YES , VALHALLA SECTOR WAS THE ENEMY , AND , YES , THEY HAD TO BE STOPPED , AND MAYBE ... MAYBE THIS WAY WAS THE ONLY WAY , BUT SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED GETTING IT DONE , AND THAT 'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CELEBRATE . THAT 'S SOMETHING YOU APOLOGIZE FOR . GOD SAYS , " IT TOOK YOU UNTIL NOW TO FIGURE THAT OUT ? " FIND ANYTHING ? ( DEVON ) : NO . NOTHING . BUT AT LEAST THE POWER 'S STILL ON . I 'M GOING TO MAKE MY WAY TO THE CONTROL CENTER , SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING THERE . ROGER THAT . LOOK , DON 'T YOU HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO ? NO . WHY ? BECAUSE YOU 'RE STARTING TO CREEP ME OUT . NO , ACTUALLY , YOU WERE CREEPING ME OUT WHEN I FIRST MET YOU . IT 'S JUST DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CREEPOSITY , YOU KNOW ? I 'M SUPPOSED TO BE HEREWHEN YOU NEED ME . I DON 'T NEED YOU . YES , YOU DO . NO , I DON 'T . LOOK , I 'M JUST TRYING TO DO A JOB HERE . THERE ARE A HUNDREDOTHER PLACES I 'D RATHER BE RIGHT NOW . YEAH ? WELL , THEN , GO . YEAH ? YEAH . OKAY . I WILL . YOU 'RE STILL HERE . YEAH . FUNNY , THAT . COME ON . WHAT ? SHUT UP AND COME ON . KURDY , HOW YOU DOING , MAN ? I 'M ALL RIGHT . HOW ' BOUT YOURSELF ? WELL ... LISTEN , WE CAME IN TOGETHER , BUT WE DIDN 'T REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK . I 'M MISTER SMITH . MISTER SMITH . YES . YOUR FIRST NAME IS MISTER ? YES . MISTER SMITH . YES . SO IF I WAS , LIKE , GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOMEBODY , I WOULD SAY THIS ISMR . MISTER SMITH ? YEAH . WHAT THE HELL KIND OF NAME IS THAT ? IT 'S NOT SOMETHING I TALK ABOUT . LISTEN , KURDY , A LOT OF STUFF 'S GONE DOWN , AND I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU AND I SHOULD SIT DOWN . YEAH , WELL , RIGHT NOW , ME AND SMITH ARE TALKING . RIGHT . WE HAVE SOME THINGS , IMPORTANT ... I HAVE SOME ISSUES . YEAH , LIKETHE NAME THING . ONE OF THOUSANDS . WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR THEM ALPHABETICALLY , OR IN ORDER OF PSYCHIC TRAUMA ? NO . I DON 'T WANT TO HEAR THEM . I 'LL CATCH YOU LATER . NO PROBLEM . I TOLD YOU YOU NEEDED ME . WOULD YOU JUST EAT ? I DON 'T NEED YOU . THERE 'S JUST CERTAIN CONVERSATIONS I DON 'T FEEL LIKE HAVING RIGHT NOW . OKAY . NO PROBLEM , I UNDERSTAND . SO , WHERE YOU FROM ? YOU MEAN BEFORE THE DEATH ? PORTLAND . PORTLAND , REALLY ? I 'M FROM PORTLAND . HOW ABOUT THAT , WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON . THAT MAKES US PRACTICALLY LIKE HOMEBOYS . THIS IS THE PART WHERE I JUST SHUT UP AND EAT , RIGHT ? YOU STILL THERE ? RIGHT HERE.WHAT 'VE YOU GOT ? I 'VE FOUND THE CO 'S LOGSHEET FOR COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM THE OUTPOSTS WE SET UP AROUND THE COUNTRY . I 'VE BEEN CHECKING MESSAGESFROM THE LAST FEW WEEKS TO SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING ABOUT ... DEVON ? JUST A SEC . OKAY , HOUSTON , WE 'VE GOT A PROBLEM . DID YOU FIND OUTWHERE THEO AND THE OTHERSARE BEING HELD ? YEAH . THAT 'S NOT THE PROBLEM . GET MARKUS ON THE LINE . QUICK . SO ... WHY ARE WE SITTING UNDER THE STAIRS ? I KNOW WHY I 'M SITTING HERE . WHY YOU 'RE SITTING HERE ... I HAVE NO IDEA . OKAY , YOU FIRST . I WAS FIVE WHEN THEY FIRST FOUND ME AND BROUGHT ME INTO VALHALLA SECTOR . FOR THE FIRST MONTH , THEY SAID I DIDN 'T SLEEP , I DIDN 'T TALK , I DIDN 'T DRESS MYSELF , I JUST SAT UNDER ONE OF THE STAIRS ALL DAY AND ONLY CAME OUT TO USE THE BATHROOM . I DON 'T ACTUALLY REMEMBER DOING IT , BUT ... WHY WOULD THEY LIE TO ME ? DOES ANY OF THIS ... I DON 'T KNOW . DOES IT RING A BELL ? NO ... I THOUGHT I 'D GIVE IT A SHOT , THOUGH- - YOU KNOW , CONNECT MY INNER TERROR TO MY OUTER TERROR , SO I CAN BALANCE THEM OUT . YOU 'RE SAFE HERE , YOU KNOW . OH , ABSOLUTELY . I KNEW I WAS SAFE AT HOME BEFORE MY FOLKS DIED , KNEW I WAS SAFE AT SCHOOL BEFORE THAT WENT UP INTO FLAMES . KNEW I WAS SAFE AT VALHALLA SECTOR BEFORE ... IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE 'S A WHOLE LOT OF KNOWING GOING ON , BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT OF SAFEANYWHERE . I THINK WE 'RE OVER THE HUMP . OVER THE HUMP ... STILL UNDER THE STAIRS . DEVON , WHAT 'S UP ? I 'VE BEEN GOING THROUGHTHE FILES , AND I 'VE FOUND WHERE YOUR PEOPLE ARE BEING HELD . IT 'S A SMALL TOWN CALLED MILHAVEN . WE USE IT AS A TRANSIT POINT TO AND FROM VALHALLA SECTOR . WE HAVE AGENTS THERE THAT PRETTY MUCH RUN ITON OUR BEHALF . I 'M FAMILIAR WITH IT . SO WE 'LL JUST GO IN , GET OUR PEOPLE OUT . THEIR STANDING ORDERS ARE CODE-NAMED " CARTHAGE . " CARTHAGE WAS AN ANCIENT CITY THAT WAS WIPED OUTIN A WAR WITH ROME . CARTHAGE , IN THIS CONTEXT , MEANS THATIF MILHAVEN HAS NO CONTACT WITH VALHALLA SECTOR FOR MORE THAN A WEEK , THEY 'RE TO ELIMINATE ANYONE WHO MIGHT ACT AS A WITNESS AGAINST THEM . NO SURVIVORS . MY GUESS IS YOUR PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT 48 HOURS TO LIVE . KURDY ? I 'M SORRY . I DIDN 'T KNOW YOU WERE- - NOBODY PACKED UP HER STUFF . MARKUS ASKED METO TAKE CARE OF IT . IT 'S JUST ... YOU KNOW , HARD . I KEEP LETTING MYSELF THINK THAT IF I LEAVE THINGS JUST AS THEY WERE WHEN SHE LEFT , THAT SHE 'D COME BACK . SHE 'S NOT COMING BACK , ERIN . I KNOW . THIS WAS THE FIRST THING I GAVE HER , NOT THAT IT WAS MINE TO GIVE . IT WAS REALLY SIMON 'S , BUT I GAVE IT TO HER , BECAUSE ... I DON 'T GET IT , ERIN . ALL MY LIFE , I 'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THAT ONE PERSON TO BELIEVE IN , ONE PERSON TO LOVE WITHOUT QUESTION . I NEVER THOUGHTI 'D FIND IT ... AND THEN , ONE DAY ... BANG , THERE IT IS . THERE SHE IS , AND THEN THE UNIVERSE JUST TAKES HER AWAY FROM ME . WHY WOULD IT BRING ME ALL THAT WAY JUST TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME AGAIN ? I DON 'T KNOW , KURDY . ALL WE CAN DO IS CHERISH THE TIME WE HAVEWHEN WE HAVE IT , AND TREASURE THE MEMORIES AFTER THEY 'RE GONE . TRY TO DO RIGHT BY THEM . EVERYTHING ELSE IS OUT OF OUR CONTROL . SO YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ? UH , YEAH . MARKUS WANTS TO HOLD A STRATEGY MEETING , ASAP . HE WANTS YOU AND JEREMIAH THERE , BECAUSE YOU TWO ARE THE BEST TEAM- - NO . NO . THERE IS NO MORE " US TWO . " JEREMIAH TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED . SHE WAS FOLLOWED THERE . THEY WERE TRACKING ALL OF US . YOU CAN 'T BLAME HIM FOR WHAT HAPPENED . LOOK , THE MAIN THING IS , WE 'VE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER LATELY . HE 'S OBSESSED AND I 'M PISSED ... I JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME , ALL RIGHT ? THAT 'S ALL . I 'VE GOT SOME THINGSI NEED TO WORK THROUGH , AND I DON 'T WANT HIM AROUNDWHILE I 'M DOING IT . I DON 'T THINKTHAT WOULD BE GOODFOR EITHER ONE OF US . I KNOW YOU 'RE HURTING ... THE SAME WAY I KNOW THAT SOONER OR LATER , THE PAIN WILL GO AWAY , BUT YOUR FRIENDS WILL ALWAYS BE HERE , AND THAT 'S JEREMIAH , AND THAT 'S ME , AND THAT 'S EVERYBODY ELSE HERE . TELL MARKUS I 'LL BE THERE , BUT I 'LL BE THERE ON MY OWN . WE ARE SO SCREWED.FACE FACTS , THEO.WE 'RE ON OUR OWN . NO ONE 'S COMING TO GET US . FOR ALL HIS BIG TALK , MARKUS IS ALL AIR . YEAH . THE WAY I HEAR IT , MARKUS GOT CAUGHT HIS OWN SELF . HE 'S SUPPOSED TO BE UPIN A SWEET LITTLE PLACE IN VALHALLA SECTOR , SPILLING HIS HEART OUT ABOUT US , SELLING US OUT TO SAVE HIS OWN NECK . EVEN IF THEY GOT MARKUS , NO WAY HE 'D SELL US OUT . HE 'S THAT KIND OF NOBLE THAT JUST DRIVES YOU NUTS , AND IF HIS ASS WAS ANY TIGHTER , EVERY TIME HE SMILED , YOU 'D HEAR SOMETHING UNPLEASANTHAPPENING DOWN SOUTH , IF YOU KNOW WHAT I 'M SAYING . NO , IF ANYBODY 'S GOING TO GET US OUT OF HERE , IT 'S MARKUS . ALL I 'M SAYING IS WHATEVER 'S COMING , WE 'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR OURSELVES . NOW , THESE GUYS HAVE MADE US A REASONABLE OFFER . RIGHT . NOW , ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , THERE 'S GOING TO BE A NEW COUNTRY . THE ONLY QUESTION IS , WHO 'S GOING TO RUN IT ? I SAY WE TELL ' EMWHATEVER THEY WANT TO HEAR , WHETHER WE MEAN IT OR NOT , JUST SO WE CAN GET THE HELLOUT OF HERE . EXCUSE ME , BECAUSE THEO CAN BE WRONG SOMETIMES . NOT OFTEN , BUT SOMETIMES . ABOUT 30 SECONDS AGO , WEREN 'T YOU JUST COMPLAINING ABOUT MARKUS SELLING US OUT , AND NOW YOU WANT TO DOTHE SAME THINGTO SAVE YOUR OWN ASS . ANYBODY ELSE SEE A CONTRADICTION HERE , OR AM I JUST NUTS ? JUST NUTS COVERS ITFROM WHERE I SIT . YOU KNOW WHY YOU 'RE HERE ? NO , WHY AM I HERE ? BECAUSE YOUR MAMA 'S MEDICAL PLAN DIDN 'T COVER ABORTIONS . AND SINCE THERE WON 'T BE ANY NEW ORDERS COMING FROM VALHALLA SECTORANYTIME SOON , AT LEAST NOT FROM ANYBODY THEY 'D RECOGNIZE , WE HAVE LESS THAN 48 HOURS BEFORE THEY DECIDETO GET RID OF THE EVIDENCE . MEANING THEO AND THE REST . EXACTLY . SO WHAT 'S THE PROBLEM ? WE GET IN , WE HIT ' EM , WE GET OUT . FIRST , IN TAKING DOWN VALHALLA SECTOR , WE MOUNTED THE LARGEST ASSAULT WE 'VE EVER ATTEMPTED . IT 'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE TO PUT THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN . SECOND , WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS ON THE GROUND IN MILHAVEN . WE DON 'T KNOW WHERE THEY 'RE BEING HELD , HOW MANY GUARDS THERE ARE , WHO 'S HOLDING THEM . WE DON 'T KNOW ANYTHING . SO ? NEVER STOPPED US BEFORE . WE NEED TO STALL , AND WE NEED INFORMATION , AND THERE 'S A WAY TO DO BOTH . WHEN WE CAME BACK FROM VALHALLA SECTOR , WE GRABBED A COUPLE OF THEIR HELICOPTERS , 'CAUSE OURS WERE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE . THEY 'VE GOT ALLTHE RIGHT TRANSPONDERS , MARKINGS , EVERYTHING . WE CAN USE THEM TO SEND SOMEONE IN ON THE PRETEXT THAT THEY 'REFROM VALHALLA SECTOR , GET THE INFORMATION WE NEEDAND BUY US SOME TIME . WHEN YOU SAY " SOMEONE , " I ASSUME YOU MEAN ME AND KURDY . UH , I ... I NEED KURDY ON ANOTHERPART OF THE MISSION . WE 'LL PAIR YOU UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE- - IT WON 'T DO YOU ANY GOOD . WELL , I MEAN ... THESE PEOPLE AREN 'T SOLDIERS , BUT THEY 'RE NOT EXACTLY STUPID EITHER . BY NOW , THEY 'RE GOING TO BE WOUND UP TIGHTER THAN A DRUM , AND ANYONE WHO GOES IN THERE AND DOESN 'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY 'RE DOING IS GOING TO GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE . WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST ? WELL ... I 'VE BEEN TO MILHAVEN A FEW TIMES , PICKING UP BIO-SAMPLES AND OTHER SUPPLIES . WE 'RE NOT BEST PALS , BUT AT LEAST THEY 'LL RECOGNIZE ME . I DON 'T THINK IT 'S A VERY GOOD IDEA . NEITHER DO I. IN FACT , I THINK IT 'S A TERRIBLE IDEA . IT 'S THE STUPIDEST IDEA IN THE HISTORYOF REALLY STUPID IDEAS , BUT I THINK IT 'S THE ONLY ONE THAT 'LL WORK . I DON 'T LIKE IT EITHER , BUT SHE 'S GOT A POINT . THANK YOU . I MEAN , I 'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE , I KNOW THE AREA , I CAN PRETTY MUCHTAKE CARE OF MYSELF , RIGHT ? SO IF YOU KNOW THE AREA , AND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF , WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO ? CLEAN UP ? DAVIS , YOU THERE ? YEAH , WHAT 'S UP ? HELICOPTER COMING IN . IT 'S ABOUT FREAKING TIME . HEY , GOOD TO SEE YOU . IT 'S LIBERTY , RIGHT ? RIGHT , IT 'S LIBERTY KAUFMAN . THIS IS JE--JERRY . HE 'S FROM VALHALLA SECTOR 'S DIVISION OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE . JUST STOPPING BY TO SEE THE OPERATION . GOING TO REPORT BACK . OH , WELL , IT 'S GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS . HADN 'T HEARD ANYTHING IN A COUPLE DAYS . STARTED TO GET WORRIED . IT 'S A COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEM . THE COM SYSTEM USESA BOUNCE-BACK FROM THE OLD SLIPSTREAM SATELLITES , AND SOMETIMES THE SOLAR FLARES CAN GET PRETTY BAD , ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SYSTEM OUT OF COMMISSION FOR A FEW DAYS TO A WEEK . SO WHAT 'S THE GOOD WORD ? WELL , THERE 'S ANOTHER ELECTION COMING UP , AND THEY SAY THAT THE AIR FILTRATION SYSTEM IS GOING TO STOP SMELLING LIKE BOILED CABBAGES , BUT I THINK ... OH . SORRY . GET RID OF THAT , OKAY ? WHAT DID HE DO ? WORST THING YOU CANDO IN MILHAVEN- - LIED TO ME . ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ME IN CHARGE OF THIS THING , MARKUS ? POSITIVE . YOU HANDLED THE ATTACK ON VALHALLA SECTOR , AND YOU CAN HANDLE THIS , AND THE OTHERS HAVE YOUR TRUST . THAT MEANS A LOT . YOU 'LL GET ON THE ROAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . WHEN JEREMIAH CALLS IN WITH THE DETAILS , WE 'LL RELAY THE INFORMATIONTO YOU EN ROUTE . BY THE TIME YOU GET THERE , YOU SHOULD BE READY TO GO . I JUST DON 'T WANT ANYBODY TO THINK THAT I 'M GRABBING FOR AUTHORITY , THAT 'S ALL . I MEAN , I 'M NOT A LEADER , I 'M JUST A GUY . ALL THE BEST LEADERS ARE . YOU 'D BETTER GO . YOU HAVE TO PICK YOUR IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TEAM . THEY 'VE GOT TO BE GOODAT WHAT THEY DO , KURDY , BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY , THEY 'VE GOT TO BE LOYAL TO YOU , SO CHOOSE WELL . THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS , ERIN . WE 'RE APPLYING FORCE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD TO SHAPE IT THE WAY WE WANT IT TO BE , IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT FROM ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE FORCE TO SHAPE THE WORLD . IT HAS TO BE DONE . WE JUST NEED TO BE SURE WE 'RE RIGHT . AND FOR MY NEXT TRICK , I 'LL WALK ON WATER , HEAL THE LAME , AND TURN WINE INTO WATER . THAT 'S WATER INTO WINE . AH , TOMATO , TOMAHTO . LOOK , I 'VE GOT TO DO THIS THING , AND MARKUS SAYS I SHOULD PICK LIEUTENANTS WHO I CAN TRUST TO BE LOYAL . MAKE NO MISTAKE , I DO THINKYOU ARE A LITTLE NUTTY ... BUT THE TRUTH IS , YOU HAVE SAVED MY HIDE TWICE , AND THAT 'S A BIG THING , SO I OWE YOU A CHANCE TO ... ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME ? ARE YOU OKAY ? YEAH , I 'M OKAY . IT 'S JUST ... WHAT ? IT 'S JUST ... MOST OF THE TIME , WHEN GOD TALKS TO ME , THERE 'S NO TONE IN THE VOICE . IT 'S NOT A MALE VOICE , IT 'S NOT A FEMALE VOICE . IT 'S NOT HAPPY , IT 'S NOT SAD , IT DOESN 'T EVEN SPEAK IN AN ENGLISH ACCENT , WHICH REALLY MESSED ME UP FOR A WHILE . IT 'S NOT ONE THING OR ANOTHER . IT JUST SORT OF ... IS , YOU KNOW ? BUT JUST NOW ... JUST NOW ... THERE WAS SADNESS , GRIEF , WEARINESS ... AND UNDER ALL OF IT ... ANGER . REAL ANGER . THE KIND OF ANGER THATMAKES YOU THROWYOURSELF ON THE GROUND AND COVER YOUR FACE AND APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYTHING YOU 'VE DONE IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE . GOD SAYS , " LOOK TO THE EASTAND DESPAIR . " THAT 'S IT ? YEAH , I GUESS YOU KIND OF HAD TO BE THERE . MAN , COME ON , WE 'VE GOT WORK TO DO . SO THE TRUCKS PULL UP WITH , LIKE , 200 PRISONERS , AND I SAY TO THE GUY , " WHAT THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE ? " AND HE SAYS , " THEY DON 'T HAVE THE FACILITIES OVER AT VALHALLA SECTORTO HOUSE THAT MANY PEOPLE . " NEITHER DO WE . IT 'S NOT HIS PROBLEM . HE 'S GOT ORDERSFROM MILITARY INTELLIGENCE . YOU KNOW , THERE 'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS IF I EVER HEARD ONE . " MILITARY INTELLIGENCE . " OH , NO OFFENSE THERE . NONE TAKEN . ANYWAY , WE FIND THIS PLACE ABOUT HALF A MILE SOUTH OF HERE , WE TAKE IT OVER , WE BREAK ' EM UP INTO SMALL GROUPS SO THEY FIT BETTER , AND THAT 'SPRETTY MUCH IT . I 'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH . I AM GOING TO BE SO GLAD WHEN YOU GUYS TAKE ' EM OFF OUR HANDS . THEY ARE A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS . THERE 'S THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR , THEO ... I SWEAR I WOULD RATHER PLUCK MY EYES OUT AND SPREAD THEM ON TOAST THAN SPEND 10 MINUTES IN A ROOM WITH THAT WOMAN . ISN 'T THAT THE ONE WE 'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK TO ? YEAH . RIGHT . IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE COULD TALK TO HER ? NO , NO WAY . WE WERE GIVEN STRICT INSTRUCTIONS- - NO ONE 'S ALLOWEDIN THE HOLDING AREA WITHOUT WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM GENERAL WAVERLY , SO ... BUT WE COULD SEE HER PRIVATELY . YOU COULD BRING HER TO US . THEO ? IN PRIVATE WITH ... YOU 'RE EITHER REALLY BRAVE OR REALLY STUPID . OR BOTH . SURE , WHAT THE HELL . I GUESS IT 'S OKAY , YOU KNOW ? I 'LL BRING HER BY IN THE MORNING , THEN YOU GUYSCAN GET SOME SLEEP . YOU 'RE GOING TO NEED IT . YOU KNOW , THE MORE I SEE OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT , THE MORE I THINK THAT MAYBE DANIEL 'S RIGHT . DANIEL ? DON 'T GO OFF ON ME . I KNOW YOU PEOPLE FROM VALHALLA SECTOR DON 'T MUCH CARE FOR DANIEL OR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY , BUT YOU KNOW , SOMETIMES I THINK HE 'S GOTSOME PRETTY GOOD IDEAS . I REALLY LOVE WHAT YOU 'VE DONE HERE . I SEE YOU FINALLY GOT THE POWER WORKING AGAIN . JUST A FEW PLACES , THOUGH . HERE , THE TOWN HALL , ALL MY LIEUTENANTS HAVE POWER . SEE , WE USE IT AS SORT OF THIS INDUCEMENT . YOU WORK WITH US , WE WORK WITH YOU . EVERYBODY ELSE ? I THINK IT WAS SOCRATESWHO SAID ... FUCK ' EM . ALL RIGHT , WE 'RE LOCKED AND LOADED . WE LEAVE IN 15 MINUTES . IT 'S THE CARROT OR THE STICK . OH , THE CARROT WOULD BE GREAT . GOOD CHOICE , MY MAN . CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION ? WHAT GOT YOU STARTEDON THIS WHOLE " GOD TALKS TO ME " STUFF IN THE FIRST PLACE ? THE FIRST TIME I HEARD GOD SPEAK ... IT 'S KIND OF HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED , BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF DEAD AT THE TIME . I 'D JUST GIVEN UP , OKAY ? I MEAN , I ... IT 'D BEEN A ROUGH LIFE , AND IT WASN 'TGETTING ANY EASIER , AND I JUST DECIDED ENOUGH 'S ENOUGH , SO I STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BRIDGE , AND I SAID , " I 'M TIRED , AND I 'M DONE NOW , " AND I JUMPED . THE REASON I CHOSE THAT WAY WAS BECAUSE I CAN 'T SWIM FOR SHIT , AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GOT THE JOB DONE RIGHT , YOU KNOW ? I REMEMBER I WAS AFRAIDTO OPEN MY MOUTH , BUT FINALLY , I FORCED IT OPEN AND LET THE WATER INTO MY LUNGS . THE NEXT THING I KNEW , I WAS SINKING , AND IT WAS QUIET , MUFFLED , PEACEFUL . IT WAS LIKE I WAS GOING TO SLEEP . THEN I HEARD THIS VOICE SAY , " NOT YET . " NOT YET . " THERE 'S WORK TO BE DONE , " AND I GOT MAD , AND I SAID , " SCREW YOU , " BECAUSE I KNEW WHO IT WAS . WHEN YOU 'RE THAT CLOSE TO DEATH , YOU KNOW WHAT THAT VOICE IS . I SAID , " SCREW YOU . " YOU RAN OUT ON US . " YOU LET PAIN AND DEATHINTO THE WORLD , " AND NOW LOOK AT US , LOOK AT WHAT WE 'VE BECOME , " WHAT YOU LET HAPPEN . " THE VOICE SAID , " I KNOW . I KNOW . " I 'VE BEEN AWAY TOO LONG , BUT I 'M BACK NOW . " MY VOICE WILL BE HEARD . " YOU 'LL BE MY VOICE . " ANYWAY , THE NEXT THING I KNEW , I WAS AWAKE ON THE SHORE . THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND SAYING THEY SAW A WAVE WASH ME UP AND JUST LEAVE ME THERE . SCARED THE HELLOUT OF THEM . THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD ? NO . SO WHAT 'S SO SCARYABOUT SEEING A WAVE WASH SOMEBODY ON SHORE ? IT WAS A LAKE . SO DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE TO YOU THAT FIRST DAY ? YEAH , JUST TWO WORDS . I GOT THE IMPRESSION THEY WERE REAL IMPORTANT . I DON 'T KNOW ... I STILL HAVEN 'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY MEAN , OR WHAT THEY HAVE TO DOWITH ANYTHING ELSE . LET ME GUESS . " JESUS SAVES . " I GOT IT , " HAPPY BIRTHDAY . " ALL RIGHT , SMITH . WHAT WERE THE TWO WORDS GOD SAID TO YOU THAT FIRST DAY ? " FRACTAL THEORY . " WHAT THE HELL IS FRACTAL THEORY ? HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW ? I 'M JUST GOD 'S SOCK PUPPET , OKAY ? HE SHOVES HIS HAND UP MY ASS AND WORDS COME OUT THE OTHER END . WHO KNEW MATH WAS INVOLVED ? WE 'VE GOT TO ROUST ' EM UP . DAVIS SAYS THE GUYS FROM VALHALLA WANT TO SEE ONE OF ' EM . WHICH ONE ? THEO . SHOULDN 'T I BE WATCHINGTHE FRONT OR SOMETHING ? YOU KNOW , SO WE 'LL KNOWWHEN THEY BRING HER IN ? NOT NECESSARY . BELIEVE ME , YOU WILL KNOW . I 'VE JUST GOT TO FINISH THIS BEFORE THEY GET BACK . GOD DARN IT , YOU ASSHOLES ! LET ME GUESS , THAT MUST BE THEO . THAT 'S THEO . WELL , THIS IS THEO . WHAT THE F ... WE FINALLY GET TO MEET FACE TO FACE . YEAH ... GOOD . WELL , THAT 'S GOOD . SO TELL THE TRUTH , AM I EVERYTHING YOU EVER DREAMED OF AND MORE ? ACTUALLY , A LITTLE LESS , BUT I 'M PREPAREDTO MAKE YOU A DEAL . SEE , WE STILLDON 'T KNOW EXACTLYHOW MANY PEOPLE ESCAPED FROM THE LITTLE PARTY WE CRASHED IN ST . LOUIS . OH , YOU DON 'T KNOW ? WELL , YOU GOT 200 OF US HERE , SO YOU DO THE MATH . I 'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU . OUR FACILITIES TO YOUR LIKING ? THAT DUMP ? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ? WHO THE HELL THOUGHTSTICKING US IN A SCHOOL GYMWAS A GOOD IDEA , HUH ? DO I LOOK LIKE A BASKETBALL PLAYER ? SOME LITTLE GYM SHORTS , SOME SNEAKERS , YOU MIGHTSURPRISE EVERYBODY . POINT IS , THEO , IT 'S A BIG WORLD OUT THERE . NOW , IT CAN EITHER BE A REALLY BAD PLACE , OR IT CAN BE A REALLY GOOD PLACE , AND THAT DEPENDS ON YOU . ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO WORK WITH US . NOW , IF YOU COOPERATE WITH THESE GENTLEMEN OVER HERE , I CAN PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR YOU . IF NOT , THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU . THERE IS SOMETHING YOU COULD DO FOR ME . WHAT ? KISS MY ASS . YOU LIKE MY PART OF THE SHOW ? YEAH , SWELL . YOU SEE ? THE WOMAN 'S TROUBLE . I CAN 'T WAIT FOR YOU GUYS TO TAKE THESE JERKSOFF OUR HANDS . NOW , THIS AREA HERE ... YOU SURE YOU 'RE ALL RIGHT WITH THE WALKING ? YOU TOOK QUITE A SHOT TO THE SELF-ESTEEM . I KNOW , IT 'S ALL RIGHT . LIKE I WAS SAYING , THIS AREA HERE SEPARATES OUR PART OF TOWN FROM THE REST . NOW , HERE WE 'VE GOT WATER , POWER FROM A GENERATORJUST DOWN THE STREET ... THE OTHERS DON 'T LIKE IT TOO MUCH , BUT WHOEVER HAS THE POWER MAKES THE RULES , RIGHT ? RIGHT . HERE 'S WHY WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE FOOD SUPPLY . SEE , YOU GIVE PEOPLE TOO MUCH , AND THEY JUST DEMAND MORE . THE BEST WAY TO KEEP ' EM IN LINE IS TO RATION STUFF OUT IN WAYS THAT SUITS OUR NEEDS . KEEP ' EM BAREFOOT , OFF BALANCE , JUST HUNGRY ENOUGH TO DO WHAT THEY 'RE TOLD . IT 'S THE ONLY WAY TO RUN A PLACE LIKE MILHAVEN , JER . IT 'S THE ONLY WAY . COME HERE . HEY . HI . HOW 'S IT GOING ? WE 'RE ALL SET.WHAT YOU GOT ? THEY 'RE BEING HELD IN A SCHOOL GYM ABOUT A HALF A MILESOUTH OF HERE . THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS . HOW MANY ? ABOUT 200 . WE GOT WORD TO THEM , TOLD THEM TO GET READY TO MOVE AS SOON AS YOU DO . ALL RIGHT . YOU 'D BETTER GET BACK BEFORE THEY START MISSING YOU . HEY , LIBERTY ... HOW 'S JEREMIAH HOLDING UP ? HE 'S OKAY . A LITTLE DENTED IN A FEW PLACES , BUT OTHERWISE HE 'S FINE . SHOULD I TELL HIM THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT HIM ? NO , JUST WONDERING . KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN , WE 'RE GOING IN . TAKE THIS . HERE . YOU WILL NEED IT WHEN THEY COME . I WON 'T TOUCH IT . LIBBY ... WHAT 'RE YOU LOOKING AT ? NOTHING . JUST WAITING . FOR WHAT ? SANTA . 'CAUSE IT 'S CHRISTMAS , BABY . MOVE , MOVE ! DAVIS ... SHIT ! WHAT 'S WRONG ? ONE OF THE GUYS WE TRADE WITH JUST GOT IN . HE SAYS VALHALLA SECTOR FELL THREE DAYS AGO . WHAT ? WHAT HAPPENED ? HE DOESN 'T KNOW FOR SURE . ALL HE DOES KNOW IS EVERYBODY 'S DEAD . BUT IF IT FELLTHREE DAYS AGO ... WE 'VE BEEN TRICKED . DAMMIT . TELL THE OTHERS . GET SOME OF OUR GUYS UP HERE , DOUBLE UP ON THE PRISONERS . WHERE IS HE ? WHERE IS HE ? HEY ! COME ON . WELL , HELLO , BOYS . OH ! YEAH , YOU 'D BETTER RUN . ANY PROBLEMS ? THESE GUYS ARE SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE . IT 'S GOING TO BE INCH-BY-INCH FOR A WHILE . COME ON . ANY MORE REPORTS OF FIGHTING ? NO , NOT SINCE DAWN . AND THE GUYS IN CHARGE ? NO SIGN OF ' EM . KURDY 'S TRACKING ' EM DOWN , ALTHOUGH ... I WOULDN 'T HOLD OUTMUCH HOPE , EVEN WITHTHE EXTRA HELP . ONCE PEOPLE SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HERE , THEY SPLIT THE PARTY PRETTY FAST . SOUNDS LIKE THEY 'VE HAD IT PRETTY ROUGH HERE FOR A WHILE , WHICH IS A SHAME , BECAUSE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL , VALHALLA SECTOR MANAGED TO REBUILD A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE HERE . YEAH , THEY JUST , YOU KNOW , DIDN 'T SHARE THE WEALTH , KEPT IT ALL TO THEMSELVES . MM-HMM . WHAT DO YOU MEAN MM-HMM ? WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD . MAKE A STATEMENT . THIS TOWN WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START TURNING THINGS AROUND . TAKE WHAT THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAD EXPLOITED , GIVE IT DIRECTION , PURPOSE . CONTINUE THE REBUILDING , BUT NOT JUST THE FAVORED FEW AND POWERFUL . BESIDES , THIS WAS A TRANSIT POINT FOR VALHALLA SECTOR , WHICH MEANS A LOT PEOPLE WILL BE COMING THROUGH ALL THE TIME . IT 'D BE A GOOD HUB FOR US . I AGREE . JUST HAVE TO FINDTHE RIGHT PEOPLE TO RUN IT , DO THE JOB RIGHT . YEAH . WHICH BRINGS ME TO YOU . YOU 'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUTALL THOSE YEARS ON THE ROAD YOU SPENT DREAMING ABOUT WHAT IT 'D BE LIKE TO HAVE A HOME , A REAL HOME , IN A TOWN LIKE THIS . BE STABLE FOR A WHILE . I 'D LIKE TO PUT YOU IN CHARGE OF PUTTING THIS PLACE BACK TOGETHER . YOU 'VE DONE US A LOT OF GOOD ON THE ROAD , JEREMIAH , BUT THIS IS POTENTIALLYA LOT MORE IMPORTANT . I DON 'T KNOW ABOUT BEING ... YOU KNOW , DOWN IN ONE SPOT . YOU KNOW , IT 'S ... IT 'S HARD SOMETIMES , BUT I LIKE BEING ABLE TO MOVE AROUND . THAT 'S MY POINT . YOU 'VE BEEN OUT THERE , SCRAPING BY JUST LIKE THEM . YOU 'LL HAVE THEIR RESPECT A LOT FASTER THAN IF WE SEND SOMEBODY FROM THE MOUNTAIN , AND I 'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ASKING LIBBY TO STICK AROUND , TOO . SHE KNOWS THE TOWN , THEY KNOW HER , AND SHE KNOWS YOU . WHEN ARE YOU THINKINGOF PULLING THE TRIGGER ? NOT FOR A WHILE . WE HAVE TO CLEAR OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS HERE BEFORE WE CAN BRING SOMEBODY IN TO ACTUALLY RUN THE PLACE . FIGURE ON ANOTHER FEW WEEKS . WELL , I 'LL GIVE IT A SHOT . YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA ? ALL MY IDEAS ARE GOOD IDEAS . MARKUS , YOUR MODESTY KNOWS NO END . THANK YOU . THAT 'S ' CAUSE IT KNOWS NO BEGINNING , EITHER . I CAN LIVE WITH THAT . HOW 'S IT GOING ? OKAY . YOU 'RE NEW HERE , RIGHT ? YEAH , I JUST GOT IN . I 'M A FRIEND OF KURDY 'S , ACTUALLY . GREAT GUY . YEAH , YEAH , HE IS . SO , WHERE 'RE YOU FROM ORIGINALLY ? ME ? NEW ORLEANS . NEW ORLEANS .

ANY NEWS ON THE MILHAVEN GUYS ? THE MAIN GUYS ? NOTHING.I THINK THEY GOT CLEAR . WE 'RE STILL TRACKING DOWN SOME OF THE LOWER-LEVEL GUYS . WELL , HOPEFULLY IT WON 'T BE A PROBLEM NOW THAT THEY 'VE LOST THEIR POWER BASE . YOU HEARD ABOUT JEREMIAH ? YEAH , AND I THINK ONCE THAT PLACE IS READY , HE 'LL DO WELL OVER THERE . GOOD . ANYWAY , THAT 'S ALL . I APPRECIATE THE UPDATE . LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION . SURE . WHAT IS FRACTAL THEORY ? UH ... FRACTAL THEORY IS A PART OF CHAOS THEORY . IT DESCRIBES A SERIES OF IDENTICAL GEOMETRIC PATTERNS NESTED ONE INSIDE THE OTHERTO INFINITY . HERE , LET 'S , UM , LET 'S ... CHECK IT OUT . AND THIS GIVES US CHAOS THEORY , WHICH SAYS THAT THE PRESENCE OF CHAOS MAY ACTUALLY PRODUCE ORDER AND PATTERNS , LIKE THIS , ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE . CHAOS MAY ACTUALLY BE NECESSARY FOR ORDER TO DEVELOP , AND NOT JUST ORDER , BUT BEAUTY . WHAT ARE THOSETWO DARK AREAS ? EVERY FRACTAL HAS A MOMENT OF TRANSITION WHERE IT CAN GROW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER , DEPENDING ON WHICH STRANGE ATTRACTOR IT 'S DRAWN TO . STRANGE ATTRACTOR ... A SET OF POINTS SUCH THAT ALL TRAJECTORIES NEARBY ARE DRAWN TO IT . OKAY , WELL , I KNOW WHAT IT DOES , BUT WHAT IS IT , MARKUS ? NO ONE KNOWS . THEY CAN SEE THE EFFECT IT HAS ON WHAT 'S AROUND IT , BUT SCIENCE ACTUALLY HASN 'T FIGURED OUT WHAT IT IS . SOME PEOPLE THINK IT 'S THE FINAL PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD , BECAUSE , LIKE GOD , WE CAN SEE THE EFFECT AS IT REPEATS THE PATTERN INFINITELY THROUGHOUT TIME , CREATING BEAUTY AND ORDER OUT OF CHAOS , BUT TO DEFINE WHAT IT IS ... NOT POSSIBLE . BUT THERE 'S ALWAYS ONE STRANGE ATTRACTOR IN THE BUNCH , HUH ? NO , ACTUALLY . ODDLY ENOUGH , THERE ARE USUALLY TWO , AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS AROUND THEM IS DEFINED BY THAT DIVISION . THE GREATER THE CHAOS , THE GREATER THE BEAUTY THAT COMES OUT OF IT . ASSUMING THAT EVERYTHING FOLLOWS THE RIGHT STRANGE ATTRACTOR , BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT SHAPES THE WORLD AROUND IT . HEY . I SAW YOUR FIRE . IT 'S COLD . I DIDN 'T GET A CHANCE TO GRAB MY COAT . ALL RIGHT IF I JOIN YOU ? THANKS . SO , WHICH WAY YOU HEADING ? EAST . THERE 'S SOMEBODY I WANT TO SEE . YOU ? EAST . I WANT TO SEE THIS DANIELWITH MY OWN EYES . NEW WORLD COMING . I WANT TO BE PART OF IT .

 God 's love will set us free . And I believe ... if I pray for that love ... if I get down on my knees ... and allow God to enter my hardened , lonely , miserable heart and change me through and through ... that miracle ... will come . Now , who here believes that with me ? Do you ? - Do you ? - Yes , sir , I believe it . Do you ? Well , believe ... because God 's love is not just some slogan . It 's a promise ... straight to you from the Lord Almighty himself . A promise paid for with the blood of his only begotten son , Jesus Christ of Nazareth . All you have to do ... is believe . Amen ! God 's love will set you free . Now , doesn 't that just lift up your heart and make you want to say " Glory ! Amen ! " ? Glory ! Amen ! Join with me . Allow the spirit of Jesus Christ to show you the way up to our heavenly Father . Glory ! Amen ! Let God 's love free you from your prison and deliver you to his side in Heaven . Glory ! Amen ! Praise his name . Praise his holy love . Glory ! Amen ! Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! - Glory ! Amen ! Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . Do you believe that , Donnie ? God loves a sack of crap like you ? The Bible says . The Bible says you kill women , out their pinkies , you get to burn in hell . - You listening to me ? - Glory . Amen . God 's got a place for you , all right , you sick puke . Then where 's that leave you ? Sorry . It 's not good enough for the Illinois penal system . My hands ! My hands ! Life without chance of parole for the premeditated and sadistic sexual murders of five Twin Cities women in 1994 . Donald Addie Pfaster . You two put this man away . Yeah . Someone forgot to throw away the key . That 's another story . We have to apprehend this man . We 'd use your help in understanding who it is we 're after . Donnie Pfaster is a death fetishist . A collector of bone and flesh , toenails and hair . - It 's what floats his boat , gets him off . - He 's a sick man . We found women 's fingers in his freezer . He liked to eat them with peas and carrots . - So it 's just women he 's after ? - Just women . Five years in here thinking about that . He 's worked up quite an appetite . I happen to know you two agents have a thing for the supernatural . The circumstances of the escape ... There is nothing supernatural about this man . Donnie Pfaster is just plain evil . Case closed . You didn 't look at the file , did you ? - A man escaped from prison . - Not a man . Donnie Pfaster . He didn 't just escape . He walked out of a maximum-security facility and no one seems to know how . - Isn 't that why we 're here ? - That 's why I 'm here . I don 't know about you . Why are you here ? - Go home , Scully . - Mulder , this case doesn 't bother me . The man abducted you . Donnie Pfaster did a number on your head like I 've never seen . It 's OK to ... walk away . Mulder , that man does things to people that no one should ever have to think about . It 's not a question of if I should stay . I don 't have a choice . So let 's get to work . Well , this isn 't the first incident . Two prisoners have escaped from facilities in neighbouring states over the past year . At 6.06 this morning Donnie Pfaster made it three . 6.06 ? What 's so supernatural about that ? Dozens of witnesses , guards and staff , and no one seems to remember anything . They didn 't know they were missing . - Were they apprehended ? - They haven 't been seen again . I already told the warden everything I know ... everything I saw that day . Yes , but I 'm still a little confused . Maybe you could go over it again . - I 'm a Christian man . - Then you 'll tell me the truth . Yeah . But I got no idea about Donnie Pfaster ... or how he broke out . You and Donnie were in the garment shop at the time he disappeared . It wasn 't just me . There was a lot of us . Yeah , but you had something happen . You had an incident . Yeah . Something like that . You cried out to the guards that you 'd cut your hands . My fingers , man . I saw them all cutoff . - Others saw them , too . - I felt them cut off . - How do you explain that ? - God works in mysterious ways , brother . Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . Posthypnotic suggestion . Did you see him ? Did I see him raise his foot ? Yes . I saw that . Programmed behaviour , prompted by suggestion - a rhythmic motion of the hands , producing an unconscious act in a conscious state . Doesn 't work on you . - I know what hypnosis is . - Group hypnosis . If you 're suggesting Donnie escaped from prison using a technique from a Vegas lounge act , I 'd think again . Mesmer was able to hypnotize entire audiences . So , how would Donnie have acquired this ability ? I 'm not saying that it was Donnie . - Then who ? - Three inmates missing from three prisons . One man has had possible contact with each of those cons . The prison chaplain . " Glory . Amen . " Not God , the chaplain . Scully , what ? That song , can you hear that ? Barely . I haven 't heard it since high school . That 's the second time in the last hour . I think if it was a make-out song , it 'd be ruined for ever now , huh ? Looking for something to eat ? - Me ? - How about today 's special ? - You aren 't a narc , are ya ? - No . - You 're looking at my hands . - You need a buff and polish . What are you ? A freak ? I ... I just got out of prison . Hey , Missy . Leave the customers alone ! I 'll do it for free . You just got out of prison , and you want to give me a manicure ? I 'll even do your cuticles . You receive the Lord 's grace and this is your thanks ? What ? Who do you think got you out of prison ? I don 't care . I 'm busy right now . The grace of God got you out , and it 's the only thing that will keep you out . - I thought you were kidding . - He 's chosen you , Donnie . Later . - You called them on me . - No . - Then do something . - I have a car . - We aren 't going to make it to the car . - It 's within his power . Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . - Was he here ? - Well , um ... we 're trying to determine that . - Did you see him ? - Well , that 's a good question . We thought we saw something , but apparently we didn 't . We got a call about a possible sighting of the suspect . - Well , something happened here , huh ? - A guy got hit by a car . Prison chaplain , it turns out . A Reverend Orison . Paramedics took him to the hospital . He 's in bad shape . Excuse me , uh , could you turn that up , please ? Yeah . You 're lucky to be alive , Reverend Orison . - Who are you ? - Special Agent Dana Scully . Believe in the Lord , Agent Scully . He believes in you . That 's nice . My partner and I are more concerned with several disappearances from maximum-security facilities that involve you . Don 't be concerned . God has them . What do you mean ? Reverend ? - You 're a believer , aren 't you ? - This has nothing to do with me . It has everything to do with you . You have faith ... have had faith . You hear him calling you , but you 're unsure what to do . It 's not exactly a long shot , sir . You stand as you do now , neither here nor there . Longing , but afraid . Waiting for a sign . When the signs are everywhere . What happened to the inmates , sir ? Everything has a reason , Scout . Everything on God 's earth . Every moment of every day , the Devil waits for but an instant . As it is , it has always been . The Devil 's instant is our eternity . The good reverend . How do you do ? Or maybe I should say " How do you do it ? " His is the word . I am but the messenger who delivers it . Well , this delivery arrived a little late . A little late and a little cold , as a matter of fact . I thought you 'd want to see it . - What is this ? - Blood of the Lamb , Reverend . The handiwork of Mr Donnie Pfaster - a young girl he picked up at the bus stop . - Oh , Lord . - Where is he , Reverend ? He took my car . - She wasn 't supposed to die . - No , Donnie was supposed to die . You were supposed to kill him . That 's why you freed him . God knows you 're capable of it . Reverend Orison is really Robert Gailen Orison , convicted in of first-degree murder . Served 22 years in Soledad . God spoke to me . He told me to look after Donnie . When God spoke to you , Reverend , did he happen to mention where Donnie was headed ? - Where are you going , Mulder ? - To prove that man 's a liar . How do you prove that somebody isn 't being directed by God ? - You don 't believe that it happens ? - God is a spectator . He reads box scores . - I don 't believe that . - You think God directs that man ? To kill ? Donnie isn 't dead . We don 't know that the other inmates who escaped are dead . So what ? You think that God directs him to ... let the prisoners out to kill ? No . But I believe that the reverend believes what he 's saying . - That it 's God working through him . - Well , plenty of nutbags do . Has he ever spoken to you ? - I 'm trying not to take offense . - What did he say ? Mulder , I have heard that song three times now . That may not mean anything to you , but it does to me . - What does it mean ? - I never thought about it before . It never meant anything , until yesterday when it made me remember something . What ? When I was 13 , my father was stationed in San Diego . I was listening to that song when my mother came in and told me that my Sunday-school teacher had been killed . Oh . He 'd been murdered in his front yard . And that 's the first time that I ever felt that there was real evil in the world . Mulder , Reverend Orison called me " Scout " . The same name my Sunday-school teacher called me . Donnie Pfaster escaped from prison at 6.06 a.m. That 's the same time that I woke up yesterday morning when my power went out . So what do you think that God is telling you ? All right . Come with me , Scout . I 'll show you how the reverend talks to God . Police are involved in a manhunt for a prisoner who escaped in Marion , Illinois . He was last seen driving a green Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top . He is described as six-feet tall , medium build ... It 's a cerebral oedema . A swelling of the brain . A trauma not uncommon with this kind of accident . Except this isn 't accidental . The cause , as it was stated to me , is self-inflicted . There 's a small hole in the skull which allows oxygen into the brain cavity . The reverend has three times the normal blood volume pumping through his brain . - And he did this himself ? - Yeah . He probably did it when he first got into prison . - When he learned how to use its powers . - Its powers ? There 's a theory that at this point in human evolution our mental capabilities are limited by inadequate blood supply . Centuries ago , in the Peruvian Andes , holy men used to remove parts of their skulls to increase blood volume . Or drill small holes . This hole in his head enables Reverend Orison to help these prisoners escape ? The practitioners of this found that they could perform certain mental tricks . One of which they called " stopping the world " . Nobody can do that . I don 't care how many holes they have . But maybe they can alter perception , creating a disparate reality which they project through hypnosis . But why ? I mean , even if he could , why ? Donnie is serving a life sentence , without possibility of parole . That 's the final judgment of society . But not in the eyes of God . Or in the eyes of a man who thinks he 's God 's tool . Well , if Reverend Orison meant to kill Donnie Pfaster , then why is he still alive ? Maybe he unleashed something he couldn 't control . Maybe he thought he was opening the door of perception , but then , unwittingly , he ... opened the gates of hell . - What ? - Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . Glory . Amen . - Are you Donald ? - Yes . I 'm from Tip Top Gentlemen 's Service . - This isn 't your place , is it ? - No . Why ? Cos I was coming up and got stopped by the landlord , like it 's any of his business . He told me some Reverend Orison lives here . - Now , you ain 't no preacher , are you ? - No . Good . They always like the weirdest things . You know what I mean ? - You OK ? - Yes . Something you want to say ? Love your hair . What are you doin ' ? - Is your hair chemically treated ? - My hair ? - I don 't know which product to use . - No , you 're not using no product . My hair 's clean . If you 're gonna be weird about it , I ought to leave . I 'm being a gentleman . Well , he a gentleman and get me a towel . I 'm gonna get outta here . It 's a wig . They lied to me . You lied to me ! Where did he go ? Marshal ? - Marshal ? - What ? The prisoner . The man you were guarding . What happened to him ? He 's gone , Scully . 80 's the marshal 's gun . You didn 't see him ? Let 's go , Scully . - What is it ? - What does this mean ? - Did you tell him ? - No , I only told you . He must have ... overheard us when we were talking in the hallway . - I didn 't mention the name of the song . - You did . No , I 'm sure I didn 't , Mulder . Well ... maybe this was meant for you . " Don 't look any further . " " Whosoever sheddeth man 's blood ... by man shall his blood be shed . " - What are you doing ? - Taking you home . The wicked ... will be punished . Pray for God 's love , Donnie . Find the humility in yourself to allow God into your heart . All you have to do is believe . Repent . You 'll feel God 's love come to show you the way to his heavenly kingdom . - Are you sorry for what you 've done ? - You ... - What did you say ? - Never ... no ... no ... - Why are you crying ? - I can 't ... I can 't ... Beg his forgiveness for what you did . For what you did to all those poor , helpless girls . My violence is always waiting ... for an instant . For when his back is turned . You can see it now . Are you crying for your sins ? Or for yourself ? No , Reverend . I cry for you ... because you cannot kill me . You know , it 's funny , when all is said and done , there 's ... not much mystery in murder . And for that I owe you an apology , Mulder . What do you mean ? Well , you were right . I was looking too hard for connections that weren 't there . Orison was a murderer , plain and simple . He liberated prisoners so he could bring them here , pass judgment . I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his god . " Glory . Amen . " Let 's go home , Scully . You know . Donnie Pfaster placed the call to the police that led us out here . It 's like he 's begging us to hunt him down . This X-file is over ... lying dead there in a grave he dug himself . Let 's let the US Marshals take over from here . Don 't look any further , Scully . Fox Mulder . Leave a message after the ... Agent Mulder , Marshal Joe Daddo in Marion . Just talked to a call girl who ID 'd Donnie as an attacker . Claims Pfaster got upset when she was wearing a red wig . Upset she wasn 't a redhead . This mean anything to you ? Appreciate a call back . Go back to hell ! - Who does your nails , girly girl ? - Let me go ! The only reason you 're alive is because I asked the judge for life ! The only reason is because we didn 't kill you when we could ! You 're the one that got away . - You 're all I think about . - I 'm a federal agent . You do anything to me and they will not give you a break this time . I 'm going to run you a bath . Now be good , and don 't cause me any problems . Put ' em up ! Did he hurt you ? - Excuse me . - Yeah . Sure . If you want to pack some things , we can get out of here . Yeah . You can 't judge yourself . - Maybe I don 't have to . - The Bible allows for vengeance . But the law doesn 't . The way I see it ... he didn 't give you a choice . And my report will reflect that ... in case you 're worried . Donnie Pfaster would have surely killed again if given the chance . He was evil , Mulder . I 'm sure about that without a doubt . But there 's one thing that I 'm not sure of . - What 's that ? - Who was at work in me ? Or what ? What made me ... What made me pull the trigger ? You mean , if it was God ? I mean ... what if it wasn 't ? I made this !

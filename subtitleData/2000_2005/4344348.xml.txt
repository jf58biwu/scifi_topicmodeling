 And in a heartbeat , everything and everyone we knew ... was gone . There were five of us . The crew of the space shuttle Odyssey . And we were the only survivors . A mysterious being who called himself The Seeker ... rescued us and sent us back in time . And now we have five years to live over . Five years to discover who or what destroyed the Earth . Five years to stop it from happening again . When once you have tasted flight ... you will always walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward . For there you have been ... and there you will always be . I 'll never forget the first day I met Ed Scrivens . We were both on that little commuter coming down from Austin to Houston ... and he looked like he had eaten too many huevos rancheros . And I could tell by that dazed look in his eyes ... and that buzz cut and that geeky little pocket protector ... that he was on his way to his first day at NASA . Yeah , we flew by guts back then . We didn 't have accountants in mission control ... we had visionaries . The first thing Ed said to me , he said , " Chuck , I think that ... " Excuse me , Commander . I 'm a great admirer of Ed Scrivens , too . But we have a full agenda here today . Can we stay on point ? The point is , Miss Hodge , the legacy of NASA ... and the legacy of NASA , in the opinion of this force ... - is man 's space flight . - I disagree . That 's NASA 's past , and we 're here to try and save her future . The cost overruns on the ISS alone are in the billions . Where is that money going ? To crew safety . Automated laboratories in space are cheaper , they 're faster ... and if , God forbid , we screw up ... nobody dies . Miss Hodge , people are buying their way into space right now ... and pretty soon there 's going to be passengers in space . And if , God forbid , something goes wrong ... those passengers will want a flesh-and-blood pilot to be accountable ... - and not some $ 29 chip . - Passengers are not NASA 's mandate . Well , maybe they should be . Maybe if we hauled a few more civilians up in space ... we 'd engender a little more support for this programme down here . Science , exploration . Those are our mandates . Ladies and gentlemen , we 're failing . We 're failing ourselves , we 're failing the American people , and yes ... yes , we 're failing the memory of NASA 's heroes . Okay , we 'll resume after a 15-minute break . The memory of NASA 's heroes ? Now that was just goddamned inspirational . You trot out dead legends , you leave me no choice . Hodge , if you don 't like the space programme ... why don 't you just find yourself another meal ticket ? Why try to blow it up ? You know , after your last mission , it 's almost funny . What was that for ? - Being such a good boyfriend . - Oh , really ? Hey . Hey , there . This party blows . You guys wanna go hang ? We could hit the cyber café , hack into the school mainframe . Don 't you think it 's time you cut the umbilical cord , Rip ? Don 't leave me hanging , bitch . - Deckard 's here . - Where ? And why do we suddenly care about Deckard ? He 's got this amazing new drug . He calls it rapture . You want to get high with Justin Deckard ? Kid voted most likely to go Columbine . When did you get so judgemental ? What , are you like 30 years old ? Not yet . - Well , hi , boys . - Hey . - You all coming ? - No . Yes . Don 't do that . What is your problem ? You 're gonna go off with them and leave me here ? - I 'll be back . - No , I 'm not waiting around for that . Suit yourself . Kids today , huh ? What 's your brother doing hanging out with that maniac ? You don 't want to know . Let 's get out of here ! This place sucks , man ! Okay . Hurry , Mommy . I have to see if my play costume fits . Oh , Mommy 's hurrying , honey . I 'm good at a lot of things , but sewing is definitely not one of them . Let me see . Good . - Oh , shit . - Mommy . Oh , shoot , shoot , shoot . The head 's too small . - I 'll fix it . - How do I look ? - Like the cutest leaf on the tree . - I 'm not a tree . I 'm dead . I 'm one of the dead ones . My baby . Come on . Well , let 's take this off , sugar . You go put your jammies on . Okay ? - Now , tell me , could he be any happier ? - I don 't think so . I tell you , it 's good to have things back to normal . Come on , big guy . Let 's go . Let 's go . Ladies and gentlemen , in the spirit of new beginnings ... I 'd like to raise a glass , or a plastic cup , as it were ... to the commencement of the eighth decade of Leyton Scott . Extraordinary astronaut ... who had the privilege of walking on the moon ... a memorable teacher , my personal flight instructor ... a dear , dear , friend , and an absolutely atrocious golfer . - Happy birthday . - I 've seen him play . Congrats . Happy birthday . Let 's take a stroll . Hi , anyone want cake ? I heard about the hearings . Yeah , Leyton , I think I 'll be playing a lot more golf with you . How do you think I 'll take to early retirement ? Like a woman with a new wrinkle . This administration seems manifestly committed ... - to abort man 's space flight . - Chuck , it 's not just this administration . Now , we 've been fighting this same battle from the inside for 20 years . No , no . Back up here , Leyton . What are we talking about ? Some ... Some plot for the planned obsolescence of pilots ? Losing Ed Scrivens ... was a terrible setback , but now that he 's out of their way ... - they 're making their move . - They 're making their ... Who 's they ? Who are we talking about ? The Cadre . At least , that 's what we call them . I don 't know if it 's their word or our word , but over the years it 's different faces ... but it 's the same agenda . Watch out for Cynthia Hodge . - You 're preaching to the choir here , brother . - There 's no man in space . There 's nobody up there to see what you 're hanging in that bright sky . Look at you two down here huddling , telling secrets . Don 't say anything to Chuck . He 's just humouring an old man . Well , all these nice people came here to see you . And I 'll be damned if I send them home ... without a very nice thank you from the birthday boy . - All right . Lead on , McDuff . - See you later , birthday boy . Hey , now . Look me up later . I want to continue this . Cadre . You have about as much interest in talking about your feelings ... as a man after an orgasm . But that doesn 't mean you have to blow off your psychiatric review . What is this ? You got paté , hearts of palms , olive tempenade . - Tempenade . - Whatever . - Don 't you have any real food ? - This is real food . God , no wonder we didn 't work out . You 're more guy than I am . Wait , wait , wait . This is a very expensive knife , darling . It 's worth one of my fingers . - You look beautiful , by the way . - Stop it . You know , this is a perfect example of your classic avoidance to the subject . - Forget about the tummy . - I 'm hungry . Let 's talk about Dr Spitzer . Your entire career is hanging in the balance , after all . Now , when are you going to tell him about your near-death EVA ? I gave up an awesome barrel racing horse when I was 15 ... because it was a bribe to go see a shrink ... after Daddy 's umpteenth affair hit the fan . Anyway , I refuse to go and talk to someone about my personal feelings ... - who gets paid by the hour . - That 's a mistake , darling . First you take the bribe , and then you fake it . - Can I infer you 've done this before ? - Oh , tons . Mother had me in therapy practically from parturition . You and your big-ass vocabulary . Can 't you just speak English ? Oh , you mean American . - All right , " From birth , y 'all . " - Oh , yeah , ' cause I sound like that . Well , we invented the language , darling . My shrink-coping mechanisms became more and more sophisticated as a child . First you find something easy to diagnose ... with a short-term treatment and a good cure rate . Here we go . Post-traumatic stress disorder . That should do nicely . - You sure about this ? - Oh , I know Spitzer . He evaluated me , or rather , will evaluate me ... when I get picked as a civilian shuttle passenger . Trust me , he 's a total idiot . I nearly sent him to therapy himself . He 'll swallow it hook , line , and sinker . That 's American . One-way functions , class . Mr Deckard , what are they ? They go one way , like heterosexual functions . So pleased you could join us , Mr Taggart . Just in time to tell our libidinous friend , Mr Deckard , what one-way functions are . Mathematical equations , easy to solve in one direction ... difficult to reverse , like ... Well , like your example there , factoring prime numbers . Good . Take out your calculators . See what you can make of this . Mr Wittig , X equals 17 and Y is ... - 2011 . - 2011 . - That 's supposed to be hard ? - That 's supposed to be hard ? - Why , you looked at the answer key . - Come on , give us a challenge , Mr Wittig . I could make your head spin , Mr Deckard ... - that wouldn 't make you look pretty ... - Doubt it . Oh , you do ? You doubt that ? Suppose X squared is congruent to Q modular P ... where P and Q are both odd prime ? Never pays to be arrogant , Mr Deckard . Aren 't you forgetting that Q is the quadratic residue of P ? Let 's skip the steps and cut to ... 64 is congruent to 13 ... mod 17 . So that 64 minus 13 equals ... 17 XN , where N equals three ... and the two odd primes are Q equals 13 ... P equals 17 , and for X , I give you 8 . Oh , shit . Troy , I have to cancel lunch . I 'm sorry . Hey , I wanted to discuss the Ramsey Hale murder trial . I got a lot of things I have to take care of . Well , something 's eating you . I know that look . I 've seen it enough in my fiancée . - I am not your fiancée . - All right . Well , my anchor 's out of sorts , bad for ratings . - Besides , we 're pals now , right ? - Pals ? - Friends . - Friends . Someone I love very dearly might possibly have cancer ... and I 'm just ... I 'm just doing ... Enough said . No bullshitting me . I want to know everything about that drug ... and your brother 's connection to Deckard now . Okay . I 'm not sure if this means anything . - Probably not going to like it . - Oh , come on , Kelsey . Jesus Christ ! Spit it out . Remember that laptop we hacked into for you ? Yes . - Bodanis made a copy . - Oh , shit . Somehow he ended up lending it to Deckard and the next thing I know ... - they 're hanging out 24l7 doing rapture . - All right , listen to me . This is really important . Do you know how he got the drug ? No . But it could 've been through a link on that laptop , right ? Yeah . Sure . Fuck . - Hey , we need to talk . - Bell 's about to ring . - Holly , I tried you five times this weekend . - Well , I 'm a busy girl . Hey , listen to me . That drug you 're taking , I think it 's dangerous . You don 't know what you 're talking about . It can break down all the walls in your mind . It can make us close again like we used to be . - No . No , we don 't need that . We don 't . - Whatever . - Hey ! - Yeah , I 'm gonna need a minute . Pervert . Do you see what this is doing to you ? - You know , you used to be fun . - No , I 'm not gonna just sit back ... and watch this happen . I care too much about you . Taggart . - What the hell are you doing in here ? - We sensed an issue . Yeah ? Well , it 's between me and Holly . Well , if you 're talking to her , you 're talking to all of us . Yeah . You don 't like it , get out of here and leave her alone . - Or we may have to blow your mind . - Give me a fucking break . - Come on , we 're not done . - Yeah , yeah . You telling me that two bubble-gummers are now hooked on some sentient narcotic ... because you let them surf the web on Naran Chandra 's laptop ? Hey , I didn 't let them . When they were cracking the access protection code ... - one of them made a copy . - A copy ? How the hell did they get a copy ? - The buck stops with you , bubba . - Yeah , okay , fine . I 'm sorry , okay . I blew it . - Well , everybody makes mistakes . - Mistakes ? Let me bring us back to the ballgame for a second , sports fans . Like that kook said in my Dad 's backyard , despite our own personal little comedies ... we only got one full-time job here , and that 's to stop everybody ... we 've ever known or loved from being blown to micro-shit in front of our eyes . But I 'll tell you this , in five years from now ... if I 'm in that goddamn rocket ship and I watch the Earth blow up all over again ... it ain 't going to be because some computer got pilfered ... by two surf punks who got earrings in all the wrong holes . Hear me ? Right . So how do we fix it ? I still don 't see any evidence that the Sentients are even involved here . - Even after what happened with his eyes ? - What did happen to his eyes ? Oh , come on . The mind affects the body tremendously . Maybe a mind enhanced by a sentient drug can affect the body ... in a disproportionately enhanced way as well . No , listen to this . All the kids that take this drug , they get really smart . Talking Stephen J. Hawking smart . Oh , yeah . What 's that , but another form of artificial intelligence ? Yeah , but there 's more . They 've got some kind of psy thing going on ... I could almost swear they read each other 's minds . Reading minds ? What 's that ? Some HUL shit ? I don 't know what it is , but it 's certainly abnormal . Great . Well , I 'll tell you how we fix it . We find the goddamn drug supply and we cut it off . - I 'm taking care of it . - You 're taking care of it ? Like you took care of Naran Chandra 's laptop ? - We 're doing this together . - What are we gonna do together , Dad ? What are you gonna do ? March into the school ... and shake them down between classes ? You 'll never get anywhere near them . I can make them trust me . Son , if I got to march into the goddamn school ... and turn them upside down , that 's what I 'm gonna do . You screwed the pooch . One fuck-up 's all you get . - I don 't need this shit . - Oh , Neil . Neil . Neil , Neil , Neil . - He 's a fucking asshole . - Don 't worry . It 's that time of the month for him . Look , I need to get a sample of that drug to get it analysed . Can you do this for me ? It 's really important . - Yeah , yeah . That 's fine . - Look , nobody blames you . Almost nobody . - I 'll take care of it . - Right . What is the exact pronunciation of H-A-U again , please ? - Hau . - Hau ? - Hey . - Hey . Can you just ... Just for a minute . Thanks a lot . - About yesterday , I 'm ... - Forget it . I was wondering ... You said that someone you care about has cancer . What kind ? It 's called gastrointestinal stromal tumour . - It 's almost always ... - Fatal . Yeah . Yeah , I know . When I was news director at KLH we did a weekly cancer story . I can check my files and get you in touch with the man on GIST . - Thank you . - Don 't mention it . Kept having these flashbacks . A tree , a smashed-up car , my father . I couldn 't see , couldn 't think , and suddenly I wasn 't on the space walk anymore . - Have you ever had a car accident ? - When I was 18 . I wrecked my T-Bird . It was bad . Do you see any connection between the accident and the space walk ? Maybe . Let 's ... Let 's talk about your father . How do you feel about his intervention ... - to reinstate you into the flight programme ? - Grateful . - You don 't think it was controlling ? - No . That you should have earned your own way ... - back on the roster . - Not at all . That he actually took something away from you rather than give you ... Look , I 'm good with it , okay ? So ... - can we just talk about the space walk ? - Okay . Immediately after the EVA , you told mission control that you ... hadn 't spent enough time in the decompression chamber . You stated that you were suffering from the bends . Miss Perry , I checked the records . Everything went according to the checklists . What is it you want me to say ? - Didn 't think you 'd show . - Why ? You feel the need to whoop my ass again , Taggart ? Those days are long gone . In case you haven 't noticed , I 'm not your little follower anymore . That how it was ? - I always thought we were friends . - You put up a good front . But you were just like everybody else . A sell out . No , man . Just tired of being pissed off all the time . You were making a religion out of your alienation , my friend . Yeah , well , isn 't life ironic ? Now everybody 's knocking at my door . Even the people who wouldn 't acknowledge my existence . Even Neil Taggart 's girlfriend . That 's low , using Holly to get back at me , man . Hey , what can I say , man ? The chick loves to be raptured . All right , asshole . Truth ? She can 't get enough of that shit ... so why don 't you tell me how it works ? I knew it would blow you away . The minute I sampled it ... swear to God , I thought about you . And you 've just seen the tip of the iceberg . - So hook me up , brother . - I don 't know , Taggart . - Takes balls . - Balls . Let 's go . - Hey , young man , what you up to ? - Hey , Chuck . Listen , you ever hear of Shakespeare ? - I never met him . - Listen to this . " And so he plays his part " The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper 'd pantaloon " With spectacles on nose and pouch on side " His youthful hose well sav 'd , a world too wide " For his shrunk shank ; and his big manly voice " Turning again toward childish treble , pipes " And whistles in his sound " " All the world 's a stage , And all the men and women merely players " As You Like It ? - You read the Cliffs Notes . - Did I ? Chuck , I 'm dying . Don 't ... Don 't be surprised . You just ... Just look at me . Well , Leyton , that 's a hell of a way to tell me . What is it ? It 's nothing that you 're going to read about in a textbook ... and it 's something only the Apollo astronauts get . - It 's moon sickness . - Moon sickness ? Leyton , I 'm not a goddamn cryptographer . You got to decode that one for me . Well , suffice it to say , we brought back more ... from our lunar escapades than moon rocks . You got to start at the beginning and run this real slow ... - Good afternoon , Chuck . - Hi , Caitlin . How are you ? - You ready ? - I guess so . Daddy 's got a doctor 's appointment . Oh , you might want to call me before you drop by next time . - I am the keeper of the appointment book . - Sorry I intruded . - Take care , young man . I 'll be talking to you . - Okay . Now this reminds me of the good old times , man . Just you and me hanging at the quarry . Rest of the world can bite us . Read about us in the papers . I don 't need to go out in a blaze of glory anymore , man . But I wouldn 't want to miss the fun . So what do you say , Deck ? You spare a couple of tabs ? Well , you know , I don 't have the equipment to press it into tabs , but ... help yourself . I 'm not going to try it now , man . I just want to score some . I 'll try it later . Rapture 's best done in a group setting . - It 's kind of a communal experience . - I 'll keep that in mind . - Offer 's running out . - What 's the rush , man ? All right , look , I think this stuff might be dangerous . I knew it . You want to take this shit to the cops , don 't you ? You 're a fucking narc . - You fucked up a good thing , Taggart . - Fuck me . Deckard , hold on , man . You 're such an asshole , man . Give me some of that shit . Cheers . Attaboy . Can you imagine a 25-pound tumour growing inside a human intestine ? I 'd rather not . Less than 5 % of GIST malignancies respond to chemo . - Up to Gleevac , automatic death sentence . - Why haven 't I heard of this before ? - A pill that actually cures cancer ? - Well , I wouldn 't put it that strongly . I mean , the medication has been shown to , like , substantially reduce ... - the level of cancerous cells . - Well , what if it was used as ... a preventative , say in cases of ... Just in the family ? I don 't know if I 'd recommend that . I mean , there 's a lot of side effects . Nausea , vomiting , liver toxicity . - Dr Bryce for you . - Oh , I 'll take it outside . I 'll be right back . Help yourself . It 's very good . May I help you ? I was just having a little bite of the sandwich . I was hungry . He offered me some of it , so ... Give him more . I think he 's sweating a little . Fucking-a , man . They finally did it . - They blew up the fucking world . - What ? The space shuttle Odyssey . Un-fucking-believable , man . You saw the future , dude . You 're the fucking man . - You know ? - It 's the rapture . We can link minds , man . All the processing power we need . You gotta tell me everything . We got to get together on this . - You and me . You tell me everything . - No . - No . - Listen , listen , listen . I got something , too . I found this code on the Internet , and I was trying to decipher it . Only this thing knew I was there , man . This thing was fucking alive , man . Fuck . Fuck . Oh , no . It gave me the formula to rapture . I 'll take you to it . And you and me and this , whatever the fuck it is ... we 'll save the fucking world , man . We 'll rule the fucking world , man . I know what you found . It 's a Sentient . - You can 't fucking trust that shit . - What are you talking about , man ? It 's the best thing that 's ever happened to me . What ? Yo , dude ... once I absorbed everyone 's fucking minds , man . I was , like , fucking God , man . I found this blueprint from a link from the website to do it permanently . You can , like , use other people 's minds as a hard drive for your storage . That 's screwed up thinking , man . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Screwed up , huh ? - Yeah . You know , the downside of rapture is that ... after one hit , you 're addicted . - When you 're ready to talk , Taggart . - Fuck you ! You 'll come crawling back . When you come down from rapture , you 'll be begging me for more ! Taggart ! They don 't eat , sleep , or bleed . That 's what you 're up against . What I 'm up against is a particular Flight Director . Wake up , Taggart . Shuttle programme 's finished . All the money 's going into JPL and robotics . Taggart , your Kennedy-era mentality couldn 't be more damaging than if ... Than if you intentionally sabotaged the mission . Say , took a demagnetiser and used it ... to destroy a satellite 's guidance system . I ain 't got a clue as to what you 're talking about . Why don 't you just take a deep breath and back off at the hearings . Sounds like I hear a threat . - Feeling vulnerable ? - Why don 't we talk about the Cadre ? What do you know about the Cadre ? Feeling vulnerable ? All right . All right . You 've got my interest . We 'll talk later . Kurt , Kurt , this is bullshit . Kurt ! - Chuck . - Where is he ? Take it easy . He 's here . Kurt , don 't be the third guy in a hockey fight . Just how in the hell did he get here ? He called me from the road . He was actually very responsible . - He knew he couldn 't drive . - 22 years old . He 's getting loaded ? He 's supposed to be saving the goddamn world . Fucking hell , Chuck . You don 't understand . He had to take the drug ... so I could get a sample from his bloodstream . It was very smart and very courageous , and you should thank him . - You got a light in here ? - No , it hurts his eyes . - Dad , make him let me out of here , huh ? - You look worse than dirt . No , no . I 'm fine , really . You guys can untie me . Come on , this is crazy . Dad . Don 't make me regret this . Scout 's honour . Oh , Dad , you 're great . - Oh , that is so much better . - What 's that on your hand ? - What ? - That . Oh , holy shit , look at that . I 've got no fucking clue how that got there . - I gotta go . I gotta go get Holly 's car back . - You 're not going anywhere . - No , I 'm fine , really . - Just sit down . No , I just need to get some fresh air , Dad . Listen to me , Neil . God damn it , Kurt ! Get the fuck off me , god damn it ! Let me go ! Let me go ! I 'll be right goddamn back ! You fucking bastards ! - That 's right . We 're sons of bitches , too . - You hate me , don 't you , Dad ? You hate me ' cause I beat Marc . I beat him and I wasn 't supposed to , 'cause I 'm the fuck-up ! I 'm the loser , and he 's your fucking golden boy ... - and I left him in the fucking dust . - Yeah , you left him in the dust . Yeah , that 's right . I did . And Mom . Mom fucking worships him and she totally trashes me ! - She trashes you . - Yeah . You know what I don 't get ? I don 't get how he blows his fucking life up ... and second time around , you 're right there for him , huh ? I don 't get that . Why do you fucking hate me so much , huh ? - You want me to die here , don 't you ? - Oh , shut your mouth , you 're catching flies . - Fuck you . - Fuck me and sit there and scream ... and pull your goddamn bones out of your sockets ... but you 're gonna sit there and sweat that shit out . Fuckers ! Wish I could give you a more precise break down ... but I 've never seen a compound like this . I can tell the molecular structure is similar to ami-nitrogen peturbo . Ami-nitrogen . It 's the orbital frontal cortex . Tell me more . It 's the command centre of addiction of the brain . One hit of this stuff , you got yourself a habit . There 's something else . Serotonin reuptake inhibitor . - A lot like ketamine . - So it 's also a hallucinogen . - Dude , it 's past that . It 's all the way to ESP . - Is that all ? There 's more , right ? I 'm no expert on internal medicine , but this synthesis ... looks like it can trigger a massive response in the cardio-vascular system . My advice : You know someone on this , see to it that they write a will . - This is you and Neil . - Yeah . - Where 's Skye and Bodanis ? - Right in here . I 'll take you to them . How you doing ? - Feel like a truck ran over me . - I can imagine . Here 's some iced tea and some orange juice with a little sugar in it . It helps with the shakes . Come on . Your friend 's been calling on your cell phone . His twin brother didn 't come home last night . - Holly and that other girl are missing , too . - What ? I know where they are . I know where they are . I 'll call Angela and Sarah . Son of bitch . - God . - Bravo . I think they flew the coop . I 'm sorry I said that . Right . What ho , Watson , a ladder . Shall we try it ? All right . Oh , Christ . - He 's coming . - What 's going on ? Neil . Neil , are you okay ? Neil ? - Oh , God . - Here you go , sweetie . Oh , my God . It 's like a horror movie . He 's here . He 's here . - What 's he talking about that " He 's here " ? - I don 't know . Who 's here ? Yeah , there 's someone pulling up out front . Neil , is he driving a late model Jeep with a roll bar and fog lights ? Cut me loose . Let me deal with him . - I 'll be right back . - Wait a minute . Where are you going ? - You can 't stop him . - Sit tight . Angela . Angela . God damn it , cut me loose ! Hey , brother . One last trip to the quarry for old time 's sake , huh ? Take it . Or I 'll fucking kill her . I swear to God , I 'll kill all three of them , man . I can do it right from here . I 've got the power , man . I 've seen the outer fucking limits . - What do you want from me ? - Everything . I want to know how you went to space . How you went back in time , saw the end of the world . Then I 'll add you to my hard drive . Processing power , man . That 's all you 're gonna be . - It doesn 't have to be like this . - It does if I fucking say so ! The blood pressure on their brain must be off the fucking chart . - Why are their eyes doing that ? - It 's an indicator of brain activity . Neil said they have some sort of psychic link . They must be in high gear . You 're a joke , man . - And you 're a victim . - I am no fucking victim . - You 're a pawn . - I am not controlled . I control ! You know , Son , you 're fucking pathetic ... and I wish you 'd never been born . I am awesome . I 'm so fucking awesome ! You 're awesome ? Feel your face . Do you know what you look like ? You 're not a god . You 're a freak . - Fuck you . - Oh , come on . You 're just a scared little boy that nobody loves ... and you 're afraid your daddy was right ... and deep down inside you really are pathetic . And rapture was your big shot to prove him wrong . - When all it did is fuck you up more , man . - Just shut up . Face it , Deck . Let me help you . I don 't want your fucking pity , man . I just wanted you to be my fucking friend . God , her resting rate is 165 . Brain activity 's turning to massive hypertension . We need to do something to relieve their blood pressure fast ... or we 're going to be looking at the remnants of three corpses . Well , if you want the advice of an amateur mechanic ... how about a pocketknife , and the knowledge that ... - pressure is a function of volume . - Good idea . Give me that knife . - Wish me luck and cover your eyes . - Got nothing to lose . All right . Here we go . I am your friend . You can start over . You can straighten yourself out . I know you can . I never needed you ! Or any of you ! Wow . I ... You 're fucking pathetic . - Slow with them . Can you stand ? - Yeah . Oh , God . Where 'd they go ? I wish you 'd never been born . Where the fuck did they go ? Take it slow . What the fuck ? You 're fucking pathetic . What are you doing ? What are you doing , Deckard ? Deckard ! Fuck . How 's Holly doing ? Neil . Okay , I guess . She 's still in the hospital . Her parents won 't let me see her . Will those kids remember anything about us ? I hope not . But we 'll have to wait and see . What the hell does a Sentient get from hooking kids on drugs anyway ? Power . A way to lend itself into the physical world . To link minds with human beings . I mean , you think of all that brilliance trapped in cyberspace ... when the real action 's out here . - Do you think artificial life forms can feel ? - Feel ? It 's pretty unlikely , but they do evolve . And controlling human beings is undoubtedly adaptive for survival . How do you feel , Neil ? Sad . It 's really sad . Perry , Angela . Results of general psychiatric evaluation . Patient seems to be faking symptoms . Possibly hiding something . Strongly recommend continued suspension from duty ... There 's a new development . Caitlin ? - Chuck . - I was looking for your Dad . I swiped his book of the Bard the other day . I wanted to come back and give it back to him . - Daddy 's in the VA hospital . - You 're kidding . - Why ? - Daddy has ALS . Lou Gehrig 's disease . His auto immune system is attacking his nervous system . Christ . I 'm sorry , I didn 't even know it . He was pretty brave about the loss of motor control ... 'cause his mind had been spared . The doctors told us it was only a matter of time . - It started just before the party . - What started before the party ? The ALS ? - Dementia . - Dementia ? He 's imagining all kinds of crazy things . He asked me to keep an eye on him ... because he was so afraid of embarrassing himself . Two days ago he woke up , he didn 't know who I was . I urge this committee to cut ... the Odyssey shuttle programme ... and redirect the funds to automated laboratories . Reinstated . In conclusion , I would like to quote Max Born . Nobel Prize winner in physics , who said ... " Intellect separates the possible from the impossible ... " reason the sensible from the senseless . " Now , space travel is a triumph of the intellect ... but a tragic failure of reason . Where 're the keys ? Where 'd Mommy put the keys ? - Right there . - Where 's my dry cleaning ? In my closet . We gotta go . - Bye , Daddy . - Okay . Bye , big guy . Closet , closet , closet . I am a tree in summer . I am tall and green . I give a home to the birds and the squirrels . I provide shade from the sun . I am an autumn leaf . My colours are bright and beautiful ... but I am not on the Earth very long . Enjoy me while you can . The end .

 [ Broots ] Raines 's estranged wife escaped that mental hospital ... just to tell you about your mother and Mirage ? Why ? [ Miss Parker ] Edna Raines said Mirage was my mother 's work . Work I 'm supposed to finish . Well , no one seems to remember any Centre project by that name . - Could it be one of her delusions ? - You didn 't see her eyes . Syd , in that moment , she was as sane as you and I. [ Scoffs ] Broots , you been downloading porn again ? My e-mail server is whacked . [ Sighs ] Someone around here has heard of Mirage . You can bet on it . Excuse me , ma 'am . I 'm here to collect burn bags for incineration . I ... knew her . - Excuse me ? - Catherine . - She was a special person . - You knew my mother ? And she always seemed like a bright and shining spirit ... even in the darkest hours . Sorry for the interruption . Maybe we could ... talk again . If you - If you wouldn 't mind , Mr. , um - Name 's Leonard . And it would be my pleasure . What the hell are you doing ? - Everything burns . - Miss Parker 'll want to see this . I said everything burns . Miss Parker must see this . Big mistake , you dumb [ Grunts ] - [ Gun Cocking ] I have to talk to Miss Parker . [ Woman ] Details are sketchy , but after the robbery , the five suspects ... posing as janitorial staff , fled MAGNA Technologies in a brown van . A hazmat team has been dispatched , and the warehouse district has been quarantined . We 'll keep you updated as the story unfolds . Reporting live from the warehouse district , now back to you in the studio . [ Man Screaming ] Let me outta here ! Let me out ! [ People Coughing ] My throat is on fire . I can 't breathe . Something is very wrong here . Oh , it 's this . It 's what we stole . - [ Hissing ] - [ Coughing Continues ] Oh , my God . Hey , science guy . You 're making me nervous . What is it ? - [ Sirens Wail ] - Soman nerve gas . - That stuff could kill us , couldn 't it ? - It already is . - What do you mean , is ? - Is . Is ! Barring some miracle , we 're all going to be dead in less than six hours . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . - [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . - [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - [ Broots ] Miss Parker . - Good night , Broots . That guy went postal down in SL 26 . Started shooting up the place . - That guy ? - Leonard , the clerk ! The burn bag guy that knew your mother ! [ Broots ] God . We tried to negotiate with him . - He wasn 't interested . - So you traded the olive branch for an Uzi . Is that your Christian way , Raines ? He was armed and out of control . He tried to kill one of my men . There must have been another way . I will not tolerate unstable behavior from Centre employees . I thought that was a job requirement . Broots . I want the surveillance footage of what just happened here . Quick . [ Man ] Ain 't bad enough there 's cops searching ' for us everywhere . Now you 're tellin 'us we got six hours to live ? Who the hell are you to be pronouncing us dead on arrival ? I don 't have to , Mr. Job . You can already feel it , can 't you ? You all can . It 's on your skin . It 's in your lungs . And it only gets worse . - [ Coughing ] - Elijah never said anything about stealing nerve gas . Poindexter here 's probably talking out his ass . I mean , us , we know each other , right ? But him ? Who the hell is he ? For all we know , he 's some out of work pharmacist . I think we should call Elijah . Eve 's right . We were supposed to steal computer chips . Yeah , not to mention 100,000 each for our efforts . Thank you very much . I say we call him . Elijah said the target was a box . That 's all he said . What difference does it make ? He owes us anyway , right ? - Screw it . I 'm gonna call Elijah . - No . Elijah calls us ! Always has , he always will ! [ Eve ] I don 't know about you , but I 'm not just gonna sit here and wait to die . There must be something we can do about this Soman gas . It affects the chemical structure of the brain . It 's only a matter of time before our paranoia turns into psychosis . - Wait . What do you mean ? We all go crazy ? - Exactly . It breaks down our tissues . First we 'll feel nauseous , then the tremors ... and then , our internal organs will liquefy . Our insides will look something like , well , something like that . Then your nose will start to bleed , and it just won 't - No , stop . Okay ? I just - Make him stop . All right , I can 't - [ Gags , Coughs ] Look . Look . It 's-It 's Elijah 's laptop . - He 's gonna help us . - [ Eve ] And what ? We wait for his call and-and then surf the Web , Mr. Job ? You 're really turning into one sarcastic bitch , you know that ? Ooh , you really do have issues with women . What was it ? Trauma with training pants ? Or did Mommy have Stoli with her cornflakes every morning ? - Shut up ! - Or what ? - You want to smack me around a little , hmm ? - Okay . That 's enough . As sick as we 're going to get , we need to stick together . - [ Hard Typing ] - This is Elijah 's laptop . The question is why hasn 't he tried to contact us ? He used us as guinea pigs is why . Look . Are we really gonna - Are we gonna die ? No , brother . We 're not gonna die . I promise you that , okay ? I 'm gonna take care of you . Don 't I always take care of you ? I don 't know about you . Me and my brother , we 're gettin the hell out of here . Come on . Let 's go . - And exactly where do you think you 're going ? - To a hospital . Use your brains , Mr. Cain . What 's left of them . The way the black-and-white 's are circling around outside ... you and your brother won 't get a block before they pick you up . Abraham 's right . Our best chance is if we stick together and wait for Elijah to contact us . All right . But if things get out of hand ... the last rational thought I 'm gonna have is putting a.38 slug in the back of your head . If this gets out of hand , I will consider that a favor . [ Coughing ] [ Job ] Hey , I 'm gettin ' somethin ' . [ Woman ] The robbery occurred in Dallas 's industrial district . Now , for unknown reasons , the area 's been cordoned off . And an emergency evacuation order has gone out ... to clear the area of all non emergency personnel . Evacuation . Cops already know what we stole . - If they know , then Elijah knows . - Yeah , well , Elijah 's gonna want his stuff , right ? So he 's gonna come down and-and get us out ofhere , right ? Right . Maybe he 'll send a flock off lying monkeys , moron . - Hey , leave him alone . Now . - [ Job ] Ease up , Tarzan . You know , I knew I should have cut and run ... when I realized you thought Groundhog Day was a national holiday . I 'm not saying it 's a major holiday . I 'm just saying it 's right up there with , uh , Secretary 's Day . Secretary 's Day isn 't a national holiday either , Job . And like you 've ever had a secretary anyway . I had a secretary once . And then lunch was over , we put our clothes back on . She went back to her typing . [ Laughs ] Eh , speaking ' of secretaries , hotshot , what are you , some kind of a entry expert ? The name Mr. Elijah gave me is Mr. Abraham . And , yes , breaking and entry is one of my specialties . I 'll bet you robbed a girl of her virginity once , which I find impressive . - Well , you should . She was your sister . - Ahh ! [ Laughing ] What the hell are you laughin ' at , half-wit ? Your mama is your sister . - Hey . - How did you people pull off 20 scores in three years ? I 'll tell you how . We don 't know a damn thing about each other . - Rule number one in the book of Mr. Elijah . - [ Electronic Ringing ] [ Electronic Female Voice ] You have a video phone call . Good morning , campers . I assume you 've all met and bonded with Mr. Abraham here . He 's a strong addition to our team . He 's an expert in many areas , mostly the sciences . - What ? Like we 're mopes or something ? - Good to see you again too , Job . I gotta agree with Job on this one . We 've done fine on our own , Mr. E. Have we ? I 'm putting Mr. Abraham in charge of this one . What ? I gotta take orders from science guy here ? You know , we made a lot of scratch for you in the past few years , pal . I don 't have to sit here and take this crap . Well , then I guess the others will have to split up your hundred thousand . - We get a hundred grand each ? - [ Elijah ] It 's big . But let 's see if we can do this one without any blood on it . Deal ? What deal doesn 't have blood on it ? [ Coughing ] Isn 't this cute ? [ Jarod ] What is it ? Brittany Tate ? Who 's Brittany Tate ? Last job we did , three months ago , a kid was murdered . [ Job Coughing ] " Brittany Tate , age nine , was smothered to death ... " during a robbery at a Westbrook estate . " Only evidence found at the scene was a pillow used in the suffocation ... a spilled bottle of perfume and a broken music box . " Well , I guess that 's what Elijah meant when he said , " one without blood . " Which one of you geniuses did her ? [ Job ] None of us knows . Nobody 's talkin ' . Mr. Cain 's gone strangely silent . - So ? - So , you killed that little girl . [ Chortles ] Lady , your brain 's already beginning to melt . What difference does it make who did it ? - It 's done . - [ Electronic Ringing ] - [ Eve Coughing ] - You have a video phone call . - Tough evening , eh ? - [ Job ] Tough ? We 've all been exposed to nerve gas ! Which means you 've accomplished your mission . Well done . You set us up ? You knew what we were stealing was deadly ! Would you have taken the assignment otherwise ? Assignment ? We 're dying in here ! One of the canisters leaked . We 've all been exposed to the gas . I realized that that might be a possibility . Check the dispatcher 's office . I 've left materials there for you to work a little chemistry , Abraham . Now , I 'm sending a couple of my men over to pick up the canisters . They should be at your location within the next few hours . And just know the contingency plans are being implemented . Forget about contingency . What about currency ? Patience , Job . Patience . - My men are on the way . - [ Job ] No , no , wait . Wait . Damn it ! Oh , God . He 's-He 's leavin ' us here to die . Shut him up , or I will . [ Coughing ] Elijah will not leave us high and dry , okay ? What 's this stuff ? Elijah left me everything I might need to create an antidote . - You think you can save us ? - Now don 't you wish you 'd been nicer to me ? - Hey , how long ? - Five hours . Maybe less . How-How do we know that you can do this ? I was an army medic in Desert Storm . I know a few things about chemical weapons . I 'm gonna need a blood sample from each one of you . Hey , screw this . This guy could be a wacko for all we know . I agree with Cain . I 'm gonna take my chances with the hospital . You won 't make it . And even if you did , they won 't have the antidote you need . You 've got all the answers , don 't you ? I 'm outta here . - [ Metal Clicks ] - Someone 's coming . [ Job ] Cops . [ Radio Chatter ] Hey , come on . It 's empty . Let 's keep moving . [ Man On Radio ] Thirteen , Sergeant , One and Central . - [ Door Closes ] - They 're gone . We 're clear . [ Light Coughing ] We have to do this before it 's too late . [ No Audio ] - Leonard didn 't kill anyone . - God , they just mowed them down . Rewind , Broots . Before they get shot . Who 's he calling ? Can 't tell . The image is too small . Maybe if I enhance the video , isolate his hands and match the motion . - You can do that ? - Well , yeah . It would take about an hour . [ Sighs ] Clock 's ticking . # [ Piano ] [ Abel ] Song reminds me of when Mom used to sing it . - [ Eve Coughs ] - # [ Resumes ] [ Static Hissing ] Signal 's comin ' back . The latest report is that the security guard , a father of six ... was found nearly strangled to death in the robbery at MAGNA Technologies , Limited . His condition is considered to be life-threatening . Police are still combing the area forthe suspects . Who did it ? Which one of you idiots strangled the guard ? - What difference does it make ? - It might make a big difference , if we survive . The question is , which one of you has the itchy trigger finger ? # [ Piano Continues ] [ Coughing ] Tell me something . What does Elijah see in that one ? It 's like a horse race entry . You want Cain , you get Abel . [ Coughing Hard ] I gotta get outta here . I gotta get out . I gotta - - Hey , calm down . - No , I gotta get outta here . - Calm down . Calm down . Calm down . - Please ! You know something ? I thought I was a really good judge of people . Guess I was wrong . What 's that supposed to mean ? Thought I was working with professionals . You snuff out a little girl . Now a rent-a-cop . Did you do it ? - What about you , Mr. Job ? - [ Laughs ] Yeah , he 's got the guts . Oh , yeah . Killin ' a little girl , that takes a lot of guts . Face it , you know . It could 've been any one of us . - Speak for yourself . - Look , it wasn 't me . Well , one guilty , all guilty . I 'll tell you one thing . Mr. Sparky and his 2,200 bolts of death , he doesn 't much care . - What about you , huh ? - Yeah ? You could 've popped that guard just as easy as any one of us . Yeah . We all know each other . We 've been doing this a while . You ? We don 't even know you . No . You don 't . Job will access the main security panel and break the various door codes ... and control panels to the security cameras . Eve , Cain and I will take the upper floor ... with Eve manning the infrared thermal sensor , and me securing the target . You sure the target 's on the upper floor ? It 's supposed to be . What I do know is that it 's kept in coldstorage . That 's where the infrared thermal grid comes in . - What about him ? - We walk in past the security guard . The janitor uniforms are already set . [ Chuckles ] Janitor ? Hey , a guy like me is gonna be hard-pressed to pass for a bucket jockey . - You have a better idea , Mr.Job ? - Yeah . I do . I , for one , want to know who the hell you are , Mr. Peabody . You know Elijah 's rule . Total anonymity . No names , no pasts , nothing . - I already broke that rule . - What ? What are you talkin ' about ? I swiped your glass from the coffee shop last week . I had a friend of mine run the prints . There ain 't squat on you out there . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? I mean , hell , every decent criminal I know has got some kind of sheet . What 's the matter ? You never broke the law before ? I broke plenty . I am just too damn smart , too damn good ... and like my freedom too damn much to ever get caught . But , you , Mr.Job , on the other hand - [ Chuckles ] What 's so funny ? Well , let 's just say that I ran a little fingerprint check on you as well . Do you mind telling me exactly what determines a lewd act ... at a kennel ? [ Coughing ] Hey , Simple Simon , fini . Why is , uh , this guy so much worse than the rest of us ? Each one of us is different . [ Sighs ] We 'll all unravel at our own genetic pace . Oh . Well , he 's definitely bringing up the rear . Ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Abel and his five-piece concerto . Well , six , if you count the green bean . [ Grunts ] Leave him alone . [ Coughing ] I 'm so sorry . Mama 's gonna be so mad at me . - Come on ! - I gotta clean this up . - Don 't do that ! - I gotta clean this up . Come on . Get outta there . Mom 's dead ! You idiot ! You stupid idiot ! She 's dead ! Has been for 10 years ! Wake up ! I 'm gonna kill the next person who says a word . How 's it coming already , huh ? - I 'm workin ' on it . - Yeah ? Well , hurry . You should sit down . It will slow the effects of the toxin . [ Coughing , Gasping ] Look , I , uh - I didn 't give you my blood before because I was worried . About what ? I 'm pregnant . Four months . Do they know ? Yeah , sure . They 'd give me a perfect little baby shower , don 't you think ? So what 's this gas gonna do to my baby ? Airbornes-They can 't pass through a placenta . Actually , your baby 's safer than you are . Okay . Y-You can take my blood . As-As long as it 's safe for the baby . I promise . - Got it ? - Got it . Butyou 're not gonna like it . He 's dialing 2725 . [ Miss Parker ] My extension . My God . [ Beeps , Rewinds ] Miss Parker , this is Leonard . I saw something I probably shouldn 't have . Something meant to be burned . Memo B437 . It 's something about an e-mail file intercepted from your computer . Miss Parker , you should see this . - [ Gunfire ] - [ Leonard Grunts ] Someone broke into your computer . That 's why your e-mail wasn 't working . Doesn 't the Centre 's system keep , uh ... duplicates of-of all incoming and outgoing e-mails ? Yeah , in the file allocation dump . None of us have clearance there . Get me that e-mail , Broots . Or someone might find all of us in the dump . Now I 'm gonna die 'cause of Mark Beyer 's bike . Come again . First thing I ever stole . You know , it had this speed shifter and this banana seat . It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw . It was almost worth the cops chasing me just so I could ride that thing down Arlington Hill . Where did Elijah recruit these two ? The Boy Scouts ? Hey , look at this . That Brittany girl , her body ... was found stuffed in a toy chest just like this , wasn 't it ? What the hell is going on ? I mean , the paper is one thing , but this ? This is Elijah ! - He 's messing with our minds ! - What difference does it make ? We need to keep our minds in the here and the now . Who cares what happened months ago ? I agree ! The here and now ! Like-Like how I want my hundred grand . Here and now . Where 's the pay ? Huh ? Where ? We did the job ! We did the damn job ! [ Beeping ] - [ Beeps ] - There we go , boys and girls . - Ready to loop signal on security camera one . - [ Beeps ] - Clear . - Go . Security door code is 88656 . [ Beeping ] You 're clear . [ Eve ] I have infrared readings . I 'm getting extreme temperature drop in room 2108 . That one . Security camera - Clear . Security door code is 61684 . You 're in the clean room . The cold room chamber door code is ... 202018 . [ Beeping ] [ Bang ] - Next time , knock . - Your limo awaits . Job , are we clear ? Job , are we clear to come out ? Job ? - [ Jarod ] Come on . - Wait . Job , are we clear ? The hell with it ! Come on ! There 's no guard . Where 's the guard ? My communication pieces shorted out . Sorry . Don 't you ever leave me hanging out like that again . You understand ? - [ Alarm Beeping ] - Come on , move ! Let 's get outta here ! Move ! [ Eve Coughing ] [ Groans ] Myinsides are starting to boil . - Come on . It won 't be long now . - [ Groaning ] I don 't want to lose my baby . - You won 't . Not-Not if I can help it . - [ Crying ] Thank you . There 's not a lot of love in this room , you know ? [ Coughing ] # [ Music Box ] Oh , my - It 's her stuff . - [ Job ] Whose stuff ? - [ Abel ] Brittany Tate . - The dead girl 's stuff . It 's her stuff . - What ? - Her stuff . - What are you babbling ' about ? Nothin ' in there . No . No . No . I saw a doll , and a pillow , a picture , a music box . Listen , I smelled perfume . [ Coughs ] The guy 's startin 'to lose it here . I don 't want to die . I don 't want to die . Not like this . [ Gasping ] [ Eve ] Oh , my skin 's on fire . Come on , science guy . What 's takin ' so long ? Freeze ! Elijah 's not gonna like it if you execute his messengers . - Elijah ? - Sent us to pick up the gas . [ Cain ] Dirty cops as messenger boys ? Typical Elijah . Hey , man , you got our money ? - What is this ? A joke ? - What ? What is it ? - There 's like 10 grand here . - Hey , the deal was one hundred grand each . Mr. Elijah is less than satisfied with the way the job went down . He 'll be in touch . Until then , if you just give us the canisters , we 'll be on our way . - Not for 10 large . - [ Electronic Ringing ] - Get over there . Move ! - You have a video phone call . Where 's the damn money you promised us ? It 's going to be much harder to sell now that it 's become such a sought after commodity . Somebody 's going to have to pay for that . That somebody is you people . You 're scum ! You know that ? I 'm gonna find you , pal . I will ! Even if you knew where I was , Mr. Job , you 'd never have the nerve . Well , maybe not him , Elijah ... but you forgot about me . Now , I 'm going to send your healthy messenger back for our money . If he isn 't here in two hours , the police get the canisters . Is that clear ? Clear enough . I just hope you all live long enough . Oh , by the way , this now ends your broadcast day . [ Beeping ] Wait a minute . Mirage . The e-mail was from Edna Raines . That 's impossible . She can barely speak . It seems she 's had another moment of clarity . That 's not all . It 's Mr. Raines who stole it . How would Mr. Raines know what was in my e-mail ? Looks like they 've been monitoring your m-mailbox since last Tuesday , Miss Parker . Tuesday ? That 's the very day Edna escaped from the institution . - He must have anticipated her contacting you . - What was in the e-mail ? Well , the text field was empty . But there was a video file attached . - [ Typing ] - Play it . - [ Beeps ] - Uh-uh . The only way to access the actual file is from the computer it was transferred to . Mr. Raines 's office . Then what are we waiting for ? I 'm bleeding to death . - Like any of you care . - [ Coughing ] Shouldn 't have killed that little girl . That 's what made Elijah so angry . Now there 's the guard . Which one of you dirtbags is into suffocation , huh ? Was it you ? [ Groans ] What happened that night ? - [ Coughing ] - [ Siren Wails In Distance ] Oh , what the hell . You 're gonna bleed to death anyway . A huge estate in Westbrook . Inside were intelligence documents . [ Scoffs ] Worth a fortune . Elijah hired us to get ' em . Whoever found them was supposed to bring them back to the van . But somebody got greedy ... decided to take a little side trip into the guesthouse . Caretaker 's daughter wasn 't supposed to be there . I think Cain did her . - Shut up ! - All for a few extra bucks . - [ Crunches ] - Aah ! Shut up ! Shut your mouth ! [ Man Coughing ] Mark ? Mark , is that you ? Hey . Look . I 'm really - I 'm really sorry about your b-bike . - # [ Piano ] - [ Sniffing ] What 's that smell ? It smells - It smells like perfume . Cut it out , green bean . - I don 't want to hear that song again . - [ Gun Cocks ] Go ahead . Play it again , Sam , just one more stinkin ' time . I dare you . [ Sniffs ] What is that smell ? Is that the antidote ? [ Jarod ] No . It 's Champs de Nuit . - My mother wore it . - [ Helicopters Whir In Distance ] I could smell it when she 'd tuck me in bed at night . [ Scoffs ] Maybe that 's a lie . 'Cause I can barely remember even if I had a mother . # [ Calm ] The ingredients in perfume , they 're known as notes , did you know that ? The perfumer , he acts as composer . Now , me , I always went for the heart . Some people , they could only smell the top notes . I went deeper to search for the soul . # [ Faster ] Perfume . Sparkling citrus notes , like lemon . Dark resonant notes , like balsam . # [ Loud , Heavy ] - [ Crash ] - # [ Stops ] The medical report just handed to me states that the MAGNA Technologies Limited ... security guard has died from injuries sustained during the robbery . Well , that was smart . He 's dead ! Didn 't you hear that ? He 's dead ! [ Jarod ] He ain 't the only one . [ Eve ] Great . That 's one more corpse on our hands . Oh , my God . I 'm bleeding . Oh , my God . You 've gotta finish the stuff . I 'm gonna die . You 've gotta finish that stuff ! . I 'm finishing it now . Let go of me ! # [ Music Box ] Oh , no . Oh , God , it 's her . It 's her . It 's the Tate kid . So what ? It 's her . So what ? - She 's dead ! Just like we 're gonna be . - I didn 't kill her . All right ? - I didn 't say you did ! - It 's not even her picture . I didn 't kill her . Oh , damn it ! Now there 's only enough antidote f - for four of us . [ Eve ] So what does that mean ? [ Jarod ] I guess that means that one of is going to die . The question is , who ? [ Helicopter Whirs In Distance ] [ Eve ] So how do we decide who gets the antidote ? [ Jarod ] We 'll leave out the one who killed Brittany Tate . Only problem is we don 't know who the killer is . - Well , we do . - What are you talking about ? Process of elimination . I mean , it couldn 't have been me because I wasn 't there , right ? I didn 't kill her . I swear . I didn 't kill her . I didn 't kill her . No . I know you didn 't . And I know you didn 't . And I know ... you didn 't . [ Gasps ] What 's going on ? Give me the antidote . - You don 't deserve it . - What ? But why ? Because ... you killed Brittany Tate . Mr. Abraham , I don 't know what you think you know , but you 're wrong . Am I ? For starters , you 're not really pregnant , are you ? That was just a fabrication so no one would believe you could ever possibly murder a child . And I checked your blood for the pregnancy hormone , H.C.G. [ Imitates Buzzer ] - Thanks for playin ' . - The gas is making you crazy . The most convincing evidence was Brittany herself . No one saw her that night except for the killer . Her picture wasn 't in the papers . It wasn 't on the news . You were the only one who recognized that photograph as a fake . Because you remember what she looked like the night you killed her . - [ Job ] Whoa ! Hey . - Put your gun down . Put your gun down . Look , if she killed the kid , then she 's the ticket to our money from Elijah . You shoot me , I take at least two of you with me . Starting with little brother . [ Groans ] Uh-oh , bloody nose . You know what that means . You tell me the truth , I 'll give you half my dose . - [ Gasping ] - Disintegration of your internal organs . The complete meltdown of your psyche . It isn 't pretty . [ Sobs ] - The little girl wasn 't supposed to be there . - [ Jarod ] But she was there ! And you killed her in cold blood just to assure her silence ! [ Gasping ] Oh , I can 't breathe ! It doesn 't have to be this way . Tell me the truth , and I 'll give this to you . Yes , I killed her ! I killed her ! Now give it to me ! - Oops . - [ Screams ] [ All Panting ] Blanks . Yes . Uh , except for mine . [ Gunshots ] Oh , and his . I thought you 'd never end this . I almost sneezed . [ Wheezing ] W-What the hell 's going on ? I 'm not exactly who I pretend to be . I 'm an agent with the Texas Bureau oflnvestigation . I purposely exposed you all to find out who killed Brittany Tate . But you were gonna get killed by the gas too . There was no Soman gas . It was just a 12 hour intestinal virus ... with a little kicker to weaken the sinus cavity and constrict breathing . Not to mention a mild herbal hallucinogen . It 's completely harmless . [ Creaking ] [ Radio Chatter ] [ Eve ] I-I don 't understand . The reporter , the cops ? It was all a hoax . Mr. Elijah cut a little deal to help us . And to shorten his stay in prison . Now you see them . Now you don 't . These were all the last things that Brittany saw before you killed her . [ Lid Slams ] None of this was real ? Nothing . Except your confession . And that 's a lifetime of real . [ Radio Chatter ] [ Broots ] I 'm into Raines 's hard drive . There 's the e-mail . But the video attachment 's been deleted . - Damn it . - Hang on . Deleting e-mails is sort of like losing your car keys . They 're not gone , just lost . Faint magnetic traces of the original can still linger where they were stored . I just have to link all the pieces . There . I got it . It 's Edna Raines . She sure doesn 't look crazy there . Maybe she 's not . Play it , quickly . Miss Parker , I need to talk to you . It 's time that you learned everything about your mother and Mirage . Please answer this message as soon as possible , and I 'll send you the where and when . It could be a matter of life and death . [ Sighs ] For Leonard , it already is . Let 's just hope it 's not too late for the rest of us . If anyone finds out how we pulled this off , some heads are gonna roll . - Starting with mine . - We caught a baby killer , didn 't we ? [ Radio Chatter ] Right . I 'll see you back at the office . - Come book these animals . - Uh , don 't wait for me . - You have other business ? - Family business .

 On May 9 , 1969 , a mile from the northern border of Laos , the 101st US Army Infantry division was advancing on hill 937 . For them , it was just a recon mission . For the Vietcong , hill 937 was a strategic point . The dozen soldiers in the company , new to combat , were to complete this routine mission in two hours . They fought back heroically for 9 days . This film does not tell their story . The year is 35,000 BC . In this untouched and savage world , mammoths live in peace with horsemoths , henmoths and wormoths . Oblivious to evil , fearing only the night , this is where our ancestors , the first men , lived . All right ... - You know my wife ? - Yes , Chief . Beautiful , isn 't she ? Right , roll call ! This is the Stone Age . - Stone ? - Here ! - Stone ? - Here ! Absent again , that one . Stone too , I suppose . I knew it . Always off together . This is nice . It 's nice being nice . Ever feel like not doing nothing ? - No . - Me neither . A quick pus ? No thanks , I quit . Rest your head . Scared you 'll mess your hair ? - Your hair 's weird . - lt 's a period do . Wasn 't it straight at school ? It 's always been curly , like grandpa and dad . My children and grandchildren were too ! - Just swallow it . - Okay . Daddy ! Hello , my chickadees ! Stone , have they been good ? Very . Just stoning each other as usual . That 's good . Just a second ... There 's one missing ! Honey , didn 't we have 12 kids this morning ? That 's right . A wild beast gobbled Stone up . I knew we had 12 . Come on , time for bed now . Off you go . How much , Stone ? One baby boarmoth a day . So half a baby boarmoth . Dung ! I 'm out of baby boarmoths . That feels so good ... Take that thing . Keep the change . It 's getting all dark ! Knock it off ! Hurry , night is sprawling . - lt 's getting all dark ! - Knock it off ! - lt 's getting all dark ! - Knock it off ! You kids can 't watch the mural all night . Lights out . Nearby , among the barren red rocks , lives a tribe with dirty , muddy hair . For centuries , the Dirtyhairs have been at war with their neighbours , for the latter hold the secret of shampoo . Despite this ancient conflict , the Cleanhairs feel on first name terms with happiness . Charge ! It really needs a hole . Baby , I 'm home . - Well ? - Failed again . - Same here . - As usual . - The others ? - All drowned . What ? Unky , unky , unky , aunty and unky ? Unky too . Unky too ? We 've lost half our family tree ! Extinction looms . Just give the shampoo thing a rest . I don 't see why we can 't manage it . I just don 't see why . Looks like the shit fairies blessed us . This shampoo war has lasted 800 years . 800 years on the 25th . We must break the circle of failure . Here 's what I suggest . What do you think ? - You didn 't say anything . - Right , sorry . Here 's what I suggest ... We 'll take a hostage ! What do you think ? Hi , Stone . Why bother ? We 're the first men , I tell you . I 'm on a dig . What ? Just practising ... You know my wife ? Beautiful , isn 't she ? Healologist , bless this hunt . Sorry , that 's gibberish . It 's a new language I made up . Didn 't the old one work ? Boring ... Mäy the hünt be gôôd änd mäy nôbôdy die . What 's with the accent ? It 's my new language . The accent tends to linger . Hunt and fish well . May meat flow like water ! Don 't sit up and beg . Don 't sit up and beg . Good Yorkimoth . So how do you like your women , like ? Alive . Well , my ideal dream woman would be ... a girl . Be more specific . Someone like me . - Meaning ? - Well , me . For a woman like that , I 'd do crazy things . Such as ? Such as stroke her hand . Where are you going ? There may be eggs in it . We 'll say we hunted them for shampoo . Come on . You swim like a dogmoth . - We show the Chief ? - No , he 'll make us hunt . Let 's wait the day out . How d 'you rate the Chief 's wife ? - She scares me . - She turns me on . Leave it , honey , I 'll bring the meat in later . If we keep hunting those , they 'll be extinct . Chief ! You know my wife ? Beautiful , isn 't she ? - Anyway ... We were hunting ... - Yes , we were hunting and hunting and hunting ... - Eggs ... - And as we were hunting ... We found this for you from the Dirtyhair Chief . Put it down ! Gently ! Put it down and freeze ! I have no choice but to take a hostage . I 've kidnapped myself . My hand proves it . Give me the recipe for shampoo by sundown ... " ... or I 'll execute myself . " Numbskull . You skipped hunting again today . In what way ? You two really underdo it . Gross . My dad 's blubbing . " Give me the recipe by sundown or I 'll execute myself . " He said it , he did it . A great man . Great moron , more like . Farewell , Lucy . - lt 's getting all dark ! - Knock it off ! Dung ! I forget every time . It 's you ! I 'll put a light on . It 's so dark in here . It 's good to see y ... That hurts ! But it 's good to see you . Can I get you anyth ... ? Stopped working ? The Chief 's mad she didn 't come to babysit . Move yourselves , excuse me . Move yourselves , excuse me . Move me , excuse yourselves . - Excuse me ! - Watch it ! Why make such a mammoth fuss over one dead woman ? All this mobbing and sobbing ! Animals eat people every day . - This was no animal . - lt was ! - May I agree with you both ? - lt was an animal ? - Wasn 't . - Was ! - lt wasn 't an animal ! - lt was ! - Look ! - Stop squabbling like infants . I 've never seen such infantry ! Let me see it . The dead body , I mean . I didn 't get what he meant . Did you ? If animals attack in caves now ... Shut up about animals ! She 's whole ! An animal would 've eaten her . - Unless he 'd just had lunch ! - Or was anorexic . We all have relatives who 've been eaten ! A animal kills to eat ! That 's wrong . Wrong ? Come here , Blondy . See that bearmoth ? Get up ! Up , slob ! I said " wrong " because he said " a animal " . If an animal didn 't kill her , maybe a vegetable did . I 've got it ! Look ! She died of old age ... but young . Sure ! Makes sense . I 'll leave you to bury the body . No ! This woman died by the hand of man ! The hand of man ? - Nobody ever killed a body . - They just did . Stay . All her orifices are sewn up . - Even her toes ? - Toes aren 't orifices . - Why do we say " Socket toe me " ? - We don 't . And here 's the bloody club that killed her . You can touch . It 's stopped working . A man killed another man . And a woman , at that ! Wait. I have an idea . Let 's swap places . This is something unheard-of . I 'm going to call it a " crime " . It just came to me . I could say " murder " , but no . - l like " crime " . - Me too . What nonsense ! I can see the point of stroking a cheek or shuffling pebbles but why bother to kill a person ? She 'd have died anyway , sooner or later. lt 's ridiculous ! Why ridiculous ? It 's new . Novelty 's always ... - l can see the point of frolicking ... - We got it . We must find out who did it . What for ? To ask him why he did it . That hurt . Are you sure , Chief ? I 'm the new Chief . I decide new stuff from now on . But it 's cruel ! You want silky hair or not , for dung 's sake ? - Now . What 's the singular of hair ? - Hair . It 's too cruel . I 'm hideous ! You 're gorgeous . At least you look like him . I can 't go to the Cleanhairs like this . You 'll go . And you 'll what ? Seduce him , bring back the shampoo - and take care of myself . - That 's right . I 've lost a son already . Enough 's enough . That shaved sheep looks like a pig . Get going , because ... Why do I do that ? Who ? Come on ! Whoever did it , own up ! Well ? I don 't mind waiting . I 'm waiting ! You 're a lousy waiter . - You 're the worst waiter I ever saw . - Give it a rest . Come on , out with it ! What 's up ? I was diggologing . The Chief wants to know who did it to know why I did it . See , I was diggologing ... Whoever says he did it , I 'll give him ... a sandwich ! What kind of sandwich ? Strawberry . - Had an idea ? - No . Your foot 's on my hair . We can find the crimer even if he doesn 't own up . Easy ! We know she was killed by a club . So the crimer must be a club owner . We know she was sewn up like my Yorkimoth . - Maybe a Dirtyhair did it . - They can 't sew , so . Sew ! A seamstress did it . A club-owning seamstress . A club-owning seamstress ! So ! We just need to find a seamstress who recently bought a club . You two hulks ! Go to the clubbery . But it 's three days ' walk ! No rush . Give yourselves three days . Three days ' walk makes six days there and back . He didn 't ask us to come back . Dear Stones ! This death will change our lives forever but life must go on as before ! Doe-ball , anyone ? Mine ! It 's fine to say " Mine ! " but it 's better to play it , okay ? Blondy , foul ! - l didn 't even touch it ! - Foul . We 'll send it back . New doe ! Skip the " Blondy " . Call me Stone . Go , moppet ! Mine ! - You 're my dream girl all over . - Wanna see my booty ? Are you old ? Stop ! It 's a beauty spot . Beauty spots ... are proof of beauty . What are you up to ? This is Stone , Stone ... He 's Stone too , or " Blondy " behind his back . Who 's she ? Guy . Who ? How d 'you pronounce it ? - Sto-o-one . - No , more like " Guy " . - More like " Guy " . - No , " Gay " . Whose name is it anyway ? What tribe are you from , Guy ? The tribe at the end of the earth , where you fall off . I 've heard of that . My whole tribe fell off , including me . Except me . Yeah ? Well , goodbye . C 'mon ! Whose serve ? Goodbye ? - We have to let her stay . - We can 't feed her . They all fell off the earth ! You want her to go home and slide off too ? Okay , she can stay . But he goes . Why me ? - So the bald one 's your Chief . - No , I am ! I 've had a wonderful day . Since the moment we met , I 've felt that survival 's worth surviving . The sweet air , the birdmothsong , etc ? How did you know ? How advanced was your tribe ? Very . We were about to discover religion . And how advanced were you ? Oh , I already asked . Are we nearly there ? Here we are . You can sleep in the dead woman 's cave . Isn 't there a lot better one ? Okay , then . Good night . I nearly forgot ! I love you . I can 't live without you either . - Come , let 's freshen up . - Let 's what ? Let 's wash your hair . Your curls aren 't even natural ! Sorry , I never get fresh on a first date . - lt 's getting all dark . - Knock it off . Only 2 and 3 / 4 more days to the clubbery . Tell me ... Sorry , I keep forgetting your name . Stone . I 'm tempted to buy a small club while we 're at it . You 'll pay more for a big one . Hi , Mum . Hi , Dad . Hi , darling . No fruit ? Yes . Want some ? Sleep well ? - l dreamed I had dark hair . - Poor dear ! I 've been sleeping so badly . Want to sleep with us tonight ? I 'm too old for it . Still ... I wouldn 't mind sleeping with you when Dad 's dead . Pass the bisonette milk . I left some for you but I finished it . Finished it ? Thanks ! I 'm treated like a stranger in this house . - We 'll have to tell him the truth . - He 's not ready yet . Hi Blondy . My name 's Stone ! Want a butterflap ? It 's a dried butterfly . - Show me your hand . - Which one ? Look ! I 've got baby fingers on this hand too ! You like leaves ? Me too ! Let 's get going . Can I tell you a short poem ? " The sky . " Pretty ! - The beginning 's weak . - " The " is good . Will you give me some shampoo ? When ? - Get gathering , slackers ! - We are . Get up ! Supposing you were lying down . You 're giving her shampoo ? You 're out of your mind ! You only met her yesterday . At least get her pregnant first . Suit yourself . Guy loves me ! I 'm a couple now . All this digging must lead somewhere . Bones ! Bones with skin on ! - lt 's getting all dark ! - Knock it off ! Dung ! Dark already . Lizardslaw anyone ? Trunk and pickles for me . That one . Lovely nosh . Delicious , except for the mud ones . Chief ! - Another corpse has been crimed ! - Who ? Stone . - Our diggologist ? - l found him . I was alone . Nobody else saw him . Two deaths . This is getting troublesome . Who 'll be next ? You . And then you . And you . That 's okay . But then it 'll be me and that 'll be sad . The sitter drew a crowd . The first one was a real letdown so the sequel won 't be a hit . Go ahead , I 've already seen it . Ah , healologist ... You know my wife ? Beautiful , isn 't she ? Well ? - Nasty ! - Not at all . Want to see where l was sitting ? Look , he 's been sewn up , like the sitter . Yes , indeed ... interesting coincidence . It 's like that old crime two days ago . He only stitched one nostril . It must be his half-brother . Maybe he was disturbed by that moron of a watcher . Nothing personal . If it 's the same crimer , then ... Bump ... Hurt ... Horror ... Stopping ... Criming ... Sewing ... People ... The horror ... Horror has a face . That 's enough of that ! - You two ! Find the crimer ! - Stop there ! - Why us two ? - l 'm too cowardly right now . Bald and cowardly at once . Do we need Miss Judgmental ? It 's okay , I 'll see to the crimer . Of course . Find him and I 'll let you off hunting . I 'll let you off for life . I 'll let you off for life , plus a few days . It 's a deal . How do you express joy ? Find me the crimer . Fast . - Thought we wouldn 't guess ? - Okay , I confess . Why did you crime them ? Answer us ! That 's good . Do that when you find him . As for ... That 's enough . - Watch it ! - Don 't point ! Ask your thing to shut up . I 've had a wonderful day . Thanks for the advice . No sweat . Coming ... Can we see your dominant male ? He 's over there . Hi . Can we ask you a few questions ? - Fire away . - Can you tell us what happened ? As usual , I was saying , " lt 's getting all dark . " Knock it off . - The diggologist didn 't say ... - Knock it off . Right . So I went to check . When I stepped inside , he was already ... Dead . You have to say " dead " . Otherwise it makes no sense . Dead . Anything else ? Yes. I saw a man running away . - Which way ? - From behind . Let 's pick up all the guys with behinds . Back up . Face the wall . Remember my shampoo . Don 't worry , doll-face , I 'll give you what you want . You 're going to see some possible suspects . Hold this for me , I 'm a witness . - lt 's getting all dark ! - Not yet . What if the crimer recognizes me ? We 've thought of that . You 'll see them from behind this one-way rock . Who turned that guy around ? Scram , you 're innocent . You know my wife ? Beautiful , isn 't she ? Well , do you recognize him ? All these rocks look alike . - Shall we move it ? - No , he mustn 't see me . How about a fake beard ? Beards don 't suit me . Shift the one-way rock . Don 't scratch the ground , dear ! - Well ? - How can I recognize their behinds ? It 'll be tougher than I thought . Thanks anyway . - lf you leave the tribe , tell us . - Of course . If you need anything , even just a drink , - drop by my cave . - You know we won 't . - Too busy ? - Too choosy . My duckymoth ! That woman scarifies me . You know we hang out ? Know what I 'm thinking ? We used to walk on four feet , now we walk on two feet . Maybe soon we 'll walk on no feet . This one here . This one 's good ... Not bad . Excellent ! - Got it in beige ? - ln beige ? Did a seamstress buy a club recently ? Going my way ? How about this one ? You recognize the watcher because he has a torch . Now we have a job , we need something to be recognized by . - You 're right . - A torch ! These ! What was it I wanted to say ? Yes . Let 's recap . - What do we know so far ? - How to make fire . We 're pretty good at inventing tools . True , too . - Dung ! - She 's just having fun ! About the crime ... The victim was disembowelled . Fine . But why take his guts ? To make guitar strings . We 're all on edge . It 's interesting . Go on . Guitar strings and ... So a guitarist did it . A seamstress sewed them up . A guitarist-seamstress . Not bad ! You 're smart , Guy . - You 're amazing . - Wait till you see me pee standing up . Find me the guitarist-seamstress who did it . I was kidding . Where do we find a guitarist-seamstress ? The Strum 'n'Stitch School . Hem in F sharp again . C major . Embroidery ! F sharp . She stays here . Yes , it could be dangerous . If I don 't come back , you can have custody of the kids . - We have none . - More free time for you , then . Cross-stitch . Semiquaver . We 're investigating the double crime with more than one victim . Don 't mind us . Guitar-stitching is like milk-carving . Keep it natural ! Try to mind us a bit . Start again . Embroidery : C major . F sharp : cross-stitch . - Look at her . - Who ? The middle one . So ? I don 't trust her . Why not ? I dunno . Intuition . Instinct . Stitch ! Strum ! Stitch ! It 's simple enough ! If your hem goes during a recital , what then ? Who 'll be sniggering then ? It 's her . Now ! Grab her ! And the dung hits the fan ! The branches go over it , not at the bottom . - lt 's getting all dark ! - Knock it off ! Good night . - Hi , how are you ? - l 'm pooped . - l was here . - Me , here . And me , just about here . Thanks a lot ! All night waiting ! This story sucks . Pinch her ! Shitess ! Are you happy with my work as watcher ? Very . - And my work as witness ? - Very . Would you rather I continued as a watcher or a witness ? Very very . Now tell us why you did it , okay ? Your move . I can 't play. I 'm working . Coffee ? I 'd prefer something with more bite . I 'm glad it 's all over . It 's not over for everyone . I didn 't like you much at first . As time goes by , I 'm getting to loathe you . Funny you said that 'cause it 's not very funny . Stone ? Try miming it with words . - Won 't that confuse things ? - Try it . The trout goes upstream step by step ! Better . Now try using words that fit the topic . Why did you kill those two women ? including a man ! - Good ! Got the hang of it ? - Yes . - l had the hang of it before , too . - Good work . - This bit wasn 't right . - Get some rest . You 're staying till you tell us why ! So it 's been confirmed ? The killer isn 't a vegetable ? Keep a close eye on her . I love your breath . Will you have it tomorrow ? The investigation 's over ! To celebrate , I suggest we all go and celebrate ! A happy hippo meal for everyone ! So let 's go ! I 'm going . We are gathered together ... Please ! We 're all here to celebrate the end of this gruelling but short inquiry , thanks to her without whom it could never have happened , Stone the murderette ! Thanks. lt wasn 't me . Still , thanks for your warm welcome . You 're all equally nice people , especially the pretty boy . Good eat ! 1 7 minutes later Actually , I did the witnessing on your latest crime . What makes a good witness ? Three things . Look , see , see . Look-seeing you now , I see your front and back are different shapes . 1 1 minutes later We forgot to invite the healologist . Join us and consider yourself invited two hours ago . - What are you feasting ? - Wrong ! What are you eating . We 've found the culprit . Let me introduce her . - You 'll pay for this ! - No , it 's my treat . - Was he like that before ? - No , he wasn 't not like that . What happened to his stuffed thing ? Nobody knows how it died . Night watcher or witness ? Given the choice ... 7 minutes later ... friends and family . My daughter , who 's also my best friend ... 4 minutes later Yes ! Greedyguts ! Doesn 't the Chief suspect anything ? Can I sleep at your place tonight ? What for ? I feel sleepy . The trouble is ... No time later - There 's only one bed . - No problem . I 'll sleep between your wife and you . If I don 't mind , I don 't see why not . Which hand ? Wait ! Let me check . Why 've you got a chicken bone there ? Why 's that chicken bone there ? - lt 's to twiddle your hair ! - l don 't think so . How pathetic ! He twiddles his hair ! He 's not naturally curly ! Hey , Curly ! You rotten Dirtyhair ! That 's right ! Dirtyhair ! Put that in your pipe ! I knew all along why your hair smells of poo but I kept quiet 'cause I thought you were different and that under your dirt , you deserved to be ... clean . But you 're like all of your tribe . Dirty Dirty ! Wait ! Stop running after me ! - Guy 's a Dirtyhair . - l knew it ! Why didn 't you say , treasure ? I knew when you said " Guy 's a Dirtyhair . " Chief ! A call for you ! Who is it ? It 's me , the murderizer / Record every fuckin ' word of this . I 'm the real crimer / You caught the wrong culprit / Am I free ? Can I go now ? I 'm the only killer / Keep him talking till we track him . Are you pro-abortion ? I dunno . How about you ? That 's a tough one . If the woman 's pregnant , I 'm pro ... Bye . But if she 's not , there 's no point , I reckon ! - Then again ... - Sorry to interrupt . Go ahead . It 's just to say I 'm killing tomorrow . Give him to me . - Who are you killing ? - lt 's a surprise . Where will you do it ? Tricky question . Let 's say I 'll do it here , where l am now . Not fair ! Get him to come here . He 's one and we 're a lot . - What ? - Take it from me ! Let me talk to him . Okay , I 'll tell him . Well then ? Okay ! Wherever you say . Can 't you ever say no ? One last thing. I 'll dump my victim in a watery hollow / Hollow ? Hullo ? Hello ? Pardon me . You got the whole conversation ? Let 's hear it again . It 's just to say I 'm killing tomorrow / Rewind . - You know we hang out ? - Too far . - l 'm the murderizer / - There . Again . I 'm the murderizer / Play it again slowly . Listen to the background noise ! Sounds of water ! " A watery hollow . " That explains it ! Croaking ! Toadmoths ! - Toadmoths live ... - ln bogs ! - Tomorrow we stake out the bog . - Not too early . You two ! To witness the crime , we 'll ... Okay , so you 're the witnesses . I 'm being left out of it . It makes me ... You use people and dump them like old ... leaves ! That 's no way to treat people ! We 're a tribe ! You 're a tribe ! You 're a tribe ! I 'm a tribe ! One last thing . Take it or leave it , it 's up to you . It 's getting all dark . As I was saying , we 'll need to wear camouflage . What 's wrong ? - Your camouflage ! - l 'm a frog . There 's no such thing as a six-foot frogmoth . Only because I 'm standing up . Look . Keep it down ! I 'm not really a chick . I 'm the Chief . You know my wife ? She 's not here . - Why not ? - Too risky . The kids are minding her . Right ! There 's a 9 / 10 chance he 'll come from there , 9 / 10 he 'll come from there , and 9 / 10 from there . That makes a 27 / 30 chance he 'll come ... from there . So we 're ideally placed . Knock it off . Aren 't you going to the bog ? The Chief asked me to but I 'm not in the mood . You can 't witness everything . You must be upset , though . Isn 't it getting all dark yet ? I 'd be upset if I were you . Pity your wife 's not here . I could have pok ... What 's Dungface doing here ? You called my daughter a dirty Dirty ! Nobody does that ! Nobody calls my girl a dirty Dirty . Proud of yourself ? Stigmatizing people for their looks ? Hooray for racial supremacy ! Fine role models you are ! Sophisticates ! - Let 's be reasonable . - You be quietable ! Yes , we have dirty hair but we give lice a home . You think you 're so great with your tresses and gloss ! You 're disgusting . You know what ? Keep your shampoo . I 'm going back to scratch my head with pride . Bye ! Where 's the crimer got to ? He 's letting us down . What 's the matter ? I 'm wandering aimlessly .

I won 't have it ! If he 's too pooped today , tomorrow it 'll be ... some other thing , and the day after that ... - Some other thing . - For example . - And then it 'll be ... - Some other thing .

 It 's time to put your lunch pail in your cubby ... and punch the clock , because you 're about to start ... the first day of your career in science ! Meet your new boss , Dr. Jonas Venture . Famed inventor , philanthropist , and globe-trotting adventurer . Now enter your new office , Gargantua-1 ... a space station so advanced , so self-sufficient ... that it has been dubbed " the ninth wonder of the world . " Here , you and over 2,000 other employees , including 200 space welders ... 74 flying nurses , and one busy barber ... labor to make the boss ' perfect vision a perfect reality . Why , even little Rusty , Dr. Venture 's companion and son ... is pitching in . Yes , it looks like Rusty 's career in science has a bright future . - Wuss ! - Knock it off ! Boys , for the last time , stop ! Brock is trying to drive ! - I 'm cool . - He started it ! No , I started it years ago in a moment of passion ... and I 'll end it the same way right here in front of Brock , H.E.L.P.eR. , and God ! Now sit on your hands and keep your mouths shut ! But now I can 't read my Giant Boy Detective book . Shouldn 't be reading in a moving vehicle , anyway . You know it makes you ... Good morning , Vent Shuttle Two . This is control . Maintain present course and enjoy the view . And may I state what an honor it is to have the illustrious Dr. Venture ... Hello ? Should I hold down the little button ? Thank you , Control . Vent Shuttle Two ready to receive docking protocol . And roger that . I 'll leave you in the hands of Lieutenant Baldavich for that procedure . Welcome home . Let 's take this slow . It 's my first time . I 'll be gentle . Now , where do you want this hot rocket ? Wow , that 's a big one ! Now , ease it in . Good . Just like that . Brock , could we speed this up ? I really have to go number one . I 'm serious . That 's it , keep going . Slow , slow . Yes , that 's it ! That 's a tight fit . It 's like they were made for each other . That 's because they were , because they were both made by the same guy . Now , can we finish this up , please ? I 'm almost there . Brace yourself , ' cause it 's gonna be ... Oh , come on ! Dr. Venture , I presume ? I wish . That 's my man , Brock . This is quite an honor , Dr. Venture . I 'm Colonel Bud Manstrong , and this vision is Anna Bal ... I mean , Lieutenant Baldavich . Great . Look , is there some kind of bathroom you could ... Of course , how insensitive of me . You 've had a long journey , and I 'm sure you need to unpack your ... extra liquid . All right , fine . Let 's just get going . OK , I like that . Let 's get to work . This way , gentlemen . Those sure are dandy-fine space suits you boys got . It 's kinda creepy in here . And cold . When it gets cold like this , I always remember back when I was a ... paperboy on this station . I must have been about your age , and on a night just like this ... one of the crew just suddenly ... cracked . Cool ! He gathered everyone in the hangar for what he called " movie night . " And under the flickering light of Burt Reynolds ' " Sharky 's Machine " ... he opened the bay doors . Almost the whole crew was there , " Sharky 's Machine . " Yep , they say his phantom spirit still roams these corridors . Phantom space man ! Right , Dr. Venture ? Whatever . Look , I 'm gonna be honest here . I really need to take a tinkle . We 're here . So , what 's the problem ? The light went on . That 's helpful . And that 's never happened before . And then we found this . So , we called you . Thought the brainiac son of Dr. Venture could lick this in a jiffy . Stand back , everyone ! Let the genius put on the ol ' thinking cap . Flattery will get you everywhere . - Doc , you OK ? - Yeah ! I 'm fine . I was just enjoying the super freedom of space travel . You know , testing out the waste collection pouch . It really is quite liberating . What ? We 're astronauts . Why is everyone ... isn 't there something we should be doing ? You heard the man ! Let 's scrub this baby down and give her a good powdering . Oh , sweet mercy , tell me these suits have a collection pouch . It 's still on ! Hold on , boys . Brock ! Come in , Brock ! Yeah , what ? How is the cargo bay ? Is it broken ? This is a huge waste of time . These panels have never been opened . The whole place smells like a new radio . Fine , just keep checking . Anything ? No , it 's still on . Do these switches even do anything ? What about now ? It 's ... wait . Wait , it 's ... On or off ? It 's still on . Anna . Maybe I 'm just a romantic fool spurred on by the friscalating starlight ... but I phoned Mother about us . I think I may be ready to ... I mean ... I don 't want to rush you into anything . Rush me ? We 've been alone on this station for six years ! Six years of hand-holding , six years of kisses on cheek , of love notes in locker ... of " I heart Anna " with that little " T.L.A. " thing ... drawn on space boot with Sharpie . What more could a girl want ? - Now ? - Still on . A problem light . Wow , Dad . What a super idea ! No , you should always put one of those on the ninth wonder of the world . - Anything ? - No . Now ? What I 'm going to ask you is no small step forward for us . It 's one giant step forward for us-kind . So , I need to know now if there 's any reason you would not want ... Brock ! You won 't get off this easy , Brock Samson . - It 's on . - It 's off . That 's called blinking , boys . - Anything ? - Now it 's just regular on . Why don 't you boys go help someone else ? Or better , get me a dry space suit . Your father 's basting in his own juices . Oh , it got in my gloves . Oh , dear God . Great design , Dad . What a super place for the gravity button . Our dad wants a dry space suit . - What happened ? - Someone opened the bay doors on him . He should be dead . Phantom space man ! We gotta warn Dad ! Gonna lie down for a sec . Too late . Is he dead ? Can 't tell . Touch his neck . - You . - No , I don 't wanna . Holy crap , I think he 's really dead ! Why would the phantom space man guy do this ? Hello , Rusty ! It 's time to get up . Dad ? I think I peed my bed . Let 's go , boy ! That pterodactyl looks mighty hungry ! And I do believe we 're on the menu ! Should I hide in a barrel or something ? Hang on , son ! These savages mean business ! Now , grab my hand and hold on tight ! Of course . Am I a ghost ? Yeah , that 's it . I have come here to show you the folly of your ways ! Take my hand , and we 'll travel to ... Come on , Dad ! One , we just proved nobody 's taking anybody 's hand here . And two , you never believed in ghosts . You were a scientist . Yeah , that 's true . I guess . I whacked my head trying to fix your stupid space station . It 's clear you 're a traumatic hallucination made manifest by my hitting my ... ego . All right , fine , fine . But I 'm still your father . What did you do to my space station ? Stop ! I 'm gonna throw up ! What do we do ? We should look for clues or something . Now , what would Giant Boy Detective do ? Screw Giant Boy Detective ! His dad 's not dead ! That was mine . This wasn 't supposed to happen ! I hate Phantom Space Man ! Oh , my God , why can 't you take the responsibility of your failure ? Because Gargantua-1 is perfect ! The problem has to be your fault . My fault ? " Gargantua-1 ! " It 's like the worst name for a space station . - I thought it cool . - No , I thought you thought it was cool . OK , crazy , then by your logic , you think you broke my space station . - I 've tried everything . - Are you kidding me ? You were just flipping switches . Think , think , tiny wonder ! You built this with me , you should know her inside and out . I was , like , ten . I just wanted to play with my plastic cowboys and Indians . Who lets a ten-year-old build a space station ? Nothing . What are you doing ? Oh , hold on . I have another call . It was someone trying to fax me . Anyway ... I 'm never gonna get used to that . What ? The pain ? It would have killed a lesser man , but you look spectacular . Oh , yeah . The pain . That 's not so bad . I hacked up some blood a couple of minutes ago . There was this big chunk about the size of a ... one of those little kiwi fruit ... but I don 't feel anything missing , so I 'm not too worried . You are quite a man , Brock Samson . Is there anything I can do to help you ? Yeah , you can unzip your space suit for me . And , uh ... I like it with the helmet on . Oh , crap ! The door 's locked ! If we can 't get to Brock , we 're goners ! No , wait ! I see him ! And it looks like he 's wrestling someone ! Shove over ! Phantom Space Man ! That 's it , Brock . Pace yourself . Conserve your energy . What the ... What 's he doing with his ... Think about it , bro . What other weapon does he have ? He needs his hands free ... for stuff . Phantom Space Man somehow got on top ! That 's it , Brocko . Shake him off ! He 's got him on his knees ! Just a matter of time now . Brock is just toying with him ! Whoa ! Pretzel bender ! Brock 's gotta teach me that one . Phantom Space Man got his helmet knocked off ! Oh , my God , he 's hideous ! Must have been deformed by space rays . Look again , Hank ! That 's not a phantom space man , that 's Lieutenant Baldavich ! - That means ... - Right ? Phantom Space Man ... is still on the loose ! Oh , great , Dad . Now it 's blinking again . How this thing didn 't follow Skylab down , I 'll never know . Looks like something pierced the hull . Super-good ! Hey ... My diet pills ! Where are my diet pills ? Oh , Rusty , you don 't need diet pills ! You just need to work a few things out . Look who 's telling me this , my dead , twelve-foot-tall father . I thought I built a bigger space station than this . I guess I remember you always towering over me . There you are , you little bugger ! Lad , remember , the solution was in you all the time . - All you have to do is ... - Bye , Dad . Well , what does it matter anymore ? Dad 's dead ! Just because some Phantom Space Man had to come here and ruin everything ! What did dad ever do to Phantom Space Man ? Phantom Space Man 's a big , fat jerk ! Phantom Space Man ! - I 'm gonna kill you ! - Why ? How could you do this ? You ... good for ... We 're alone ! No ! Kill ! Vengeance ! - For what ? - Brock ! - Dear God ! - Freak ! Take it ! Die ! Die ! Die ! So ... how was he ? - How was who ? - Aw , come on ! I shook his hand ! It 's all fat and stubby ! He must have , like , a huge mushroom down there ! So , does he have a smurf living in it or what ? - What 's gotten into you ? - Got into me ? I know what got into you ! And that 's what got into me ! You don 't deserve to be jealous ! I gave you every chance in the world ! I 'm not jealous ! I 'm pissed ! You said you were gonna wait till ... No ! You said we were gonna wait ! I don 't have to take this . That 's because you already took it . In the ... lap ! From ... not me ! Go , Team Venture . Attention ! There has been a hull breach ! That 's Pop ! He 's alive ! - Danger ! - Daddy ? Brock , come to the bridge immediately ! Pelligro ! I am now repeating , there has been a hull breach ! This is serious ! Now , what do we have here ? What is this , Tang ? They still smell of my salty leavings . - Doc ? - What ? Where have you been all day ? There was a little accident in the cargo bay . No matter . I need you to get suited up and repair a hole ... in this hunk of junk my dad left to the world . - Yeah , OK , fine . - I 'm going with him . It could be ... dangerous out there . Great . Oh , fine , Dad . Blame me . Blame Rusty . But who 's fault is this ? Oh , God , it 's mine . Sir , you have plucked the flower of the woman I love . I trust you will do the right and noble thing . She will make a fine wife . Her father invented the " Mr. Mouth " game , so she 's an heiress . You two should be quite comfortable . It 's really my fault . I should have been more attentive to her ... carnal needs , but to be fair , I must warn you ... if you harm a hair on her sweet little head , I will ... No , wait ! How inappropriate ! Don 't do ... Wait ! Stop ! Look ! I fixed it ! - Dad ! - Daddy ! - We thought you were dead ! - You 're alive ! OK , boys . Let 's take it easy . See , crybaby ? Told you he was alive . Oh , man ! What is it like to be such a huge liar , huh ? " I 'm all super-scared of Phantom Space Man ! " Oh , that 's it , bookworm ! Oh , fantastic . I 'll just slip into this little number , and we can get out of here . No need to say good-bye . I 'll let them thank me later . Good Lord , what are you waiting for ? Let me in ! Not until you apologize . Oh , you 're kidding me ! I can 't feel my right side ! I 'm going to die out here ! I 'm waiting . That 's good soup .

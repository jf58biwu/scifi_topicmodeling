 Every wormhole system has millions of exits , each to a distinct time and place . Einstein , what the hell is going on here ? Aeryn 's out there under a flag of truce . Katratzi . You will never get the wormhole tech from me . Scorpius is here , looking for the key to what is inside my head . He will use you and the baby . We need a sensor distorter for our ship , to fool long-range scans . Gizah ! A Scarran ! If I 'm not back at the Pod in half an arn , you go without me . What ? - Go . Pilot : The Scarran warship is still in pursuit . What about the ... Baby ? What about the baby ? What ? Where 's Aeryn ? A bioloid . Crichton : I don 't care about the things you care about . Peacekeepers rule the Scarrans , Scarrans rule the Peacekeepers . I care about one thing . Help me get her and I will give you wormholes . And now , on Farscape . Aeryn : There was one guard . I don 't remember her face . She never told me her name . She told me a legend about ... how Sebaceans once had a god called ... Djancaz-Bru . Six worlds prayed to her . They ... built her temples , conquered planets . And yet , one day she still ... rose up and destroyed all six worlds . And when the last warrior was dying , he ... he said , " We gave you everything . Why did you destroy us ? " And she looked down upon him , and she whispered , " Because I can . " Aeryn could be dead . - The Scarrans will not kill her . They wanna use her to find me . The Scarrans will mind rape her until she has no allegiance to you . - I will find her before then . She will not be able to resist for long . I know ... Stop . I 'll find her . I just want to make you aware of the improbability ... - I am aware . Shut up . ... of what you propose . You have a plan ? Yes , and don 't interrupt before I finish , no matter how stupid it sounds . John ... I said do not interrupt . When I met Einstein , I blipped to bizarro Moya . Same Leviathan , but different . The Stark there uttered " Katratzi . " I know that . I thought it was gobbledy-gook . But then Sikozu heard the same word when Aeryn was being kidnapped . I know that , too . You think this Katratzi is the Scarran base they 'll be taking her ? Right . But you do not know where it is , do you ? No , you know that . - Right again . So , I figure if bizarro Stark knows the name of the base he might know its location . That 's it . Best I got . You got any better ideas , I listen . If I help with this insanity , and we do get Aeryn back , you will tell me all you know about wormholes ? Every equation , every formula ? Everything . What are we in , the Mob ? Your turn . Nosferatu . First instinct is always right . Scarran Blood Vow . You hate everything Scarran . I will help , if you taste . Look , Djancaz-Bru , I know I 'm not the sort of person who usually does this sort of thing , so I 'm not quite sure what I 'm supposed to be saying , except that I really need your help . I need you to send me some sort of sign that he 's coming for me . Can you do that ? ( door opening ) I 've given you time to consider . Are you ready to answer ? Yes . ( grunting ) Stiinga-tuk . Wait , did I pronounce that correctly ? Let me try that again . Stiinga-tuk . That 's better . I gave you a chance . Where is Crichton ? I don 't know ! I ... Stop resisting . Where is he ? My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . Three years ago I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm in a distant part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped prisoners , my friends . I 've made enemies . Powerful , dangerous . Now all I want is to find a way home to warn Earth . Look upward and share the wonders I 've seen . Aeryn : He 's ... he 's on Moya . 600 telliks and rising . If you don 't stop , you 'll kill her . I 'm using no more force than usual . This won 't harm her . What do you know abut Crichton 's wormhole research ? 620 . I don 't know anything . He didn 't tell me anything . Stop . ( agonized grunt ) What 's the matter with this one ? Is she weak , or is she faking ? She 's not faking . Well when she wakes , convince her to tell me all that she knows if she wants to live . Or I will start again . D 'Argo : You 're going to go to the variant Moya ? Yeah . - But you could end up on Earth again . Mess up everything . No , I got this hum in my head , like a whale . A whale ? What 's a whale ? You know what a fish is ? - Fish . Think big fish with sonar . John , I think you should have a rest before ... D , I got a hum in my head . I 'm gonna follow it . Well , you got something in there , but it 's not a brain . Einstein said I can get back to the places I 've been to before . It 's like a homing beacon . I can make it . You can 't go with fek-face . He 'll screw you and then he 'll betray you . So little trust , Nebari . What 's going on ? Why are you going with him ? John and I have an agreement . D 'Argo : What agreement ? - The details are confidential . John , don 't . Guys , I know what I 'm doing is stupid , but it 's out of my hands . I gotta save Aeryn . You know that . Just get us close to the wormhole . If we don 't come back ... Right . Feeling better ? Critical heat delirium . Mmm , I almost couldn 't get your temperature down in time . I thought Peacekeepers were supposed to be battle strengthened . Why did his heat probe almost kill you ? I ... I 'm tired . Just go away . Wish I could . Listen , that fenik will kill you unless you give him a reason not to . I 've seen it happen . You 'll be just another D.I.T. " Died in Transit . " All right . Don 't listen . I 'm just trying to save your life . Are you really Sebacean ? Yes . Does it make it easier ? To make the others do your dirty work and you take the coward 's choice ? Listen , I 've heard all that dren before . Usually from people like you , chained to a cell . Look at me . I 'm not . You know why ? Because I figured out a long time ago , Peacekeepers , Scarrans , what difference does it matter who rules ? It won 't be me . All I 'm going to do is survive . I suggest you should do the same . I 'll tell Captain Jenek you 're ready for another interrogation . Pilot , thank Moya for us and stay well clear . You guys have come far enough . Crichton , Moya 's senses indicate the wormhole is destabilizing . Yeah , it 's not too good . Grasshopper , you still up for this ? I was just musing . If you miss your intended target , we could change the future , or the past . Create a world devoid of Peacekeepers and Scarrans . Would you like that , John ? Clear the mechanism . Focus . Guys . We 'll see you around . - Good luck , Crichton . And come back . Left . And left again . No , damn , right ! Thought you knew where you were going . Shut up , Grasshopper , I 'm trying to concentrate . Left . Up there . That should be it . And we are ... . here . And where exactly is " here " ? The signal from her bioloid stopped before our dreadnaught could locate their Leviathan . How did they detect it so quickly ? That is the first question I will ask the Sebacean . Captain , there 's something about her . Her reaction to your heat probe was so severe , I was ... Nurse , you seem confused . I don 't care if she dies . Her usefulness is most likely already completed . I know , but give me an arn . I have an idea how she still might be useful to us . One arn . Then she answers or dies . Something to make you sleep . I don 't need any help . Orders . - No , I don 't want it . Stay away from me . Get away from me and don 't touch ... ( gasps ) It 'll only be more painful if you fight . ( grunts ) Get it out of me ! ( grunts ) Wait a minute . You 're not giving me something . You 're taking . What are you doing ? ( grunts ) ( gasps ) : What have you done ? Crichton : Some kind of crap has frozen up in the fluid drives . We 're not going anywhere unless I can ... Hey , flip that switch again . ( machinery whines ) Ironic , wouldn 't it be , if we were to die here together . Yeah , we 're a regular Romeo and Juliet . Damn this . This spinning makes me feel like I 'm drinking Mezcal . You got something like Mezcal ? Drink the drink , eat the worm . I could see you eating a whole plateful of worms . Maybe not . Just for the record , if you 'd have gotten the information and were able to control wormholes , what would you have done with it ? Taken over as much of the universe as possible , found your home planet and destroyed it . That 's not funny . No . No , I would use the wormholes as a deterrent against any future Scarran attack . All right , strap yourself in . We could be in for a little jolt . That stuff should be melted by now . ( machinery whirs ) Oh , come on baby . This should work . ( engine racing ) Left . Again . Gotta go . Is that the Moya we 're looking for ? Crichton : Better be . My head 's ringing like a fire bell . How did you know we planned to kidnap Grayza ? ( gasping ) : I ... I just ... Again ! How did you know ? ( gasps ) : Accident . Captain Jenek , stop . The Sebacean is dissembling , she will ... No ! I know why she 's reacting like this . Stop ! - Do not interfere . She 's with child . Scarran heat probe will kill a pregnant Sebacean . With child ? Well she was close to Crichton , was she not ? Yes . I couldn 't have stopped him . - You should have . Aeryn is dead . I know Scarrans . She is dead by now . We are not leaving . Grayza knows the location of this wormhole . D 'Argo ! She put the Skreeth on Moya when we were last here ... Listen to her , Captain . She 's right . Grayza knows Crichton used this wormhole as a path to get back to Earth . She knows he 'll come back here . And I thought you were finally convinced Crichton 's wormholes would get you home . ( sighs ) We 're staying another arn . Pilot , get Moya to do a long point , all range scan . I don 't care if it 's a gas cloud or an asteroid field . I wanna know the microt she senses something . Setting scans now . Can you retrieve incumbent knowledge from fetal DNA ? Not here . But the med labs on Katratzi might be able to . What have you done ? What did you say to him ? ( whispers ) : I 've saved your life . You realize what this could mean ? If this is Crichton 's child , we could learn all he knows about the wormholes from this fetal DNA . Yes . - Get me out of here . Get me the frell out ! Get me out ! Aeryn : Djancaz-Bru , I 'm going to say this again because I don 't think you heard me last time . Just get a message to him . Let him know where I am so that he can find me . I didn 't think Peacekeepers had gods . I thought they believed in the Warrior Code . " Battle and die " and all that dren . Is there a Peacekeeper here ? Can she help us ? She can 't even help herself . She 's praying . Whose child is it ? Captain Jenek will force it from you . He believes that if he can find the human 's child , the Scarrans will reward him . Right now , he 's dreaming of palaces and virgins . I 'm very happy for him . - I warn you . He won 't kill you . But unless you tell him what he wants , he 'll make you wish you were dead . I have a dozens of embryos inside me . I recreated with so many people . Mmm . Just one . Whose is it ? No , really . P.K. Tralka , that 's what they used to call me . Talk to the other women here . They 'll tell you . We can keep you drugged , asleep . Or we can make things hard and ugly . Worse than you can imagine . ( shuddering ) Crichton : Every wormhole has millions of exits to different times and places which are complete and unending . So in this reality everyone on Moya has became someone they weren 't before ? Like they went into a blender . Why ? With these wormholes , anything is possible . Somewhere the Cubs are winning the World Series . Don 't ask . Did you feel that ? Better hurry . We got an arn before Crais overruns this place and slaughters everybody . Stark ? Rygel ? Crichton : Mm-hmm . It 's a weird universe . I didn 't invent it . Morrock : Genetic incubation . They find something interesting about us . See if they can produce an offspring that they can use . They 've bred me six times . Three of them died before term . Three of them , I don 't know where they are . So what 's interesting about you ? The organic food on my planet grows a metal skin . I can dissolve it with saliva . Why don 't you spit on these and get us out of here ? Can 't do that . Only thin metal . Right . Well , that 's why they 're breeding me . See if this little gnlk in here can destroy weapons grade metal . And you just happen to be awake right now to talk to me ? No . I palm the dren they give me to sleep . ( whispers ) : I 've saved up enough so I can kill myself whenever I want . You don 't believe a word I 'm saying . You think I 'm working for that bitch nurse ? Well ? - They don 't need me to control you . You can 't beat them . They travel us around on frelled-up freighters like this , and no one ever knows exactly where we are . No one can save us . And we can 't escape . I know . I 've tried for cycles . Then I gave up . But I see . You still think someone 's coming . You should talk to me . In here , talk 's all you 've got . I heard you say it . " Katratzi . " I don 't know , Crichton ! She did . She said it . She said it when Chiana was killed ! - Chiana 's dead ? No , no , no . Chiana 's not dead . Would you like me to take over the interrogation ? Both : Go away ! Stark , shut up ! - Does Zhaan know ... I heard you say a Scarran word . Katra ... - Katratzi . Katratzi . I think it 's a military base . - Katratzi . Do you know the location ? Military base ? No . You said it when you were crossing someone over . When you were in that trance state . No , I never have any recollections when I 'm in the stykera state . But how could you speak in the Scarran tongue ? ( grunts ) Once I ... I must have crossed over a Scarran . They tell me things . And now you have no memory of it ? No . Only when I 'm in the trance does the knowledge come flooding back to me . Where are you going ? Keep him here . I 'll be right back . It is a remarkable reproductive structure . Watch . The Sebacean egg is fertilized . It splits with life , it splits again , then stops . How does that happen ? The ovum secretes a fluid that keeps the pregnancy in stasis . Literally , freezes the explosion of life . She can store this proto-fetus for up to seven cycles before triggering gestation . And that won 't hurt the embryo ? No . This will just pry the truth out of her . No , don 't use that . I won 't lie to you . I 'll just tell you what you want to know . You wouldn 't lie to me ? ( grunts ) ( gasping ) Yes , of course I 'd lie to you , you stupid bitch . ( low growl ) Aeryn . Whose child is inside you ? Yours . Whose child ? I don 't know . Is it John Crichton 's ? If ... it were ... Is it his ? I don 't kn-know . ( growls ) ( gasps ) There was another man . Another ? Mmm . Aeryn : Velorek . This Velorek , where is he now ? He ... he 's dead . How did he die ? What charge ? ! High Command executed him for treason because I betrayed him . The man who conceived your child ? I reported him . She 's lying ! The serum isn 't working , give her more ! Mmm , I 'm not lying . I 'm just not a very nice ... ( groans ) I , uh ... . I ... This Velorek . Is he the father of your child ? No . Wake up . Wake ... up ! Wake her up . I can 't . Not until some of the serum wears off . Are you working for her ? No ! Of course not ! Your mind seems uncompromised . What about hers ? How is her embryo coming along ? I 'm afraid her initial DNA scan shows no enhanced ability to the embryo . Then I will kill it . No , it 's too early . No ! It 's too early ! Your tests can 't be accurate ! They 're accurate . And I will to watch it die . No ! No ! It 's too early ! No ! No ! ( screaming hysterically ) : No , no , no ! ( screaming ) Unless I get answers that please me , you will be next . Rygel [ Noranti ] : Let go of me ! Who are you ? ! Crichton ! What is happening ? Dominar . Quiet . ( grunts ) Crichton , who is this tralk ? ! Now . You can channel past journeys when you cross a soul over ? Yes . ( screaming ) What are you doing ? ! Now cross her over ! - You cannot just shoot people ! They 'll be dead in an arn . You said so yourself . We don 't have time to negotiate . Now cross her over ! No , I can 't ! I can 't ! I can 't ! And why not ? Because I have to love the soul ! I have to care about where it goes to cross it over ! What do you mean , " love the soul " ? You never had to love the soul before . I 've always had to love the soul . Different Stark , different rules . So , what happens if you don 't love the soul ? You won 't cross it over ? No , it 's not a question of " won 't " . I can 't . When they die they ... they just go . Nothing happens . Whoops . ( crying ) Are you in pain ? What do you care ? I 'm just a Scarran spy and you 're a Peacekeeper . No , I 'm not a Peacekeeper . ( sighs ) That 's the third one they 've terminated . I saw it on the scan . It must 've been malformed , or ... The three that survived , they were beautiful . Healthy . And you 've had six pregnancies ? They 'll wait a while , then they 'll fertilize me again . Unless I 've got the guts to ... Have you ever had a child ? No . - Never ? Well , soldiers seldom do , unless they 're placed on a breeding roster . In any case , it 's not the same as being a mother , is it ? That 's why I vowed I 'd never have one that way . And now ? And now protecting this child will probably end my life . ( whispering ) : There is another way . To make sure that they never get it . I 've hoarded enough sleep pills for the both of us . But I 've never been brave enough to end it myself . Coward . What 's your name ? Morrock . Well , Morrock , when someone comes to get me , they can save you , too . Who does Stark love ? - You cannot just shoot people ! I find your priorities odd . We are in a hurry and these deformities are preordained to die soon . Who does Stark love ? ! Just because you do not have the resolution to ... I got more than enough resolution the last time I was here and sometimes , Scorpy , I do not like the way you do things ! ( growls ) Pilot : I 've been comming them every 30 microts . Nothing . Rygel : Will his module even be able to make a reentry through that ? I don 't know . Moya 's scans indicate the wormhole 's stability has decreased another 12 % . D 'Argo , you know what we should to do . - Stop hammering me . Grayza is no fool . We will die if we stay here much longer . I 'm not leaving Crichton ! We 're giving him another chance . How much longer ? - Look , I don 't know ! Back off , psycho . No , we should vote . We wake up Noranti and the six of us vote . Because Crichton is safe ! But we will die if Grayza finds us here ! Majority rules . Not yet , it doesn 't . ( inhales sharply ) I 'm the Captain . I 'm not willing to make that decision . Pilot : I 'm afraid you might have to . - What 's the matter , Pilot ? Moya 's long range scan has just picked up another vessel heading this way . D 'Argo : Is it military ? I can 't tell yet . Jenek : Any match on the embryo DNA ? Vreena : Nothing . It 's a pattern the memory banks have never catalogued , so it could be half human . We have no sample of Crichton 's DNA . If I tell you ? Your pain will end . When I was off Moya , I had another job . Assassinations . Subversions . Whatever I was ordered to do . There was a man named Lechna . He was my contact . Found me all my assignments . But he was also my lover and I have tried to suppress it until now to protect him . But I don 't want the drugs anymore . It is most likely his conception . This man . What world is he from ? He 's from a place called Vendrall . It 's a small planet off most charts . Have you heard of it ? Yes . It 's in the Callus Nebula . That 's a long way from here . Perhaps that 's why the DNA isn 't in our database . I might cross-check the genetic similarities from the same nebula . We 're gonna do this my way with Stark , not yours . You haven 't got the resolution to do what 's necessary . - You can stop already with the resolution ! Crichton ! What are you doing with Chiana ? That is Jool . Jool , just let us pass . What are you doing with Pip ? ( whispers ) : Shoot him . Technically , it 's a she . Shoot it ! Let me handle this . Where are you taking Chiana ? - Jool , let us pass . Stay back ! Shoot it ! Damn it , Jool ! Shoot it ! ( yells ) ( snarls ) Are you satisfied ? No . I don 't like the way you do things either . Very messy . No , don 't ! - You lied ! We found record of Vendrall DNA . Your embryo is not the product of one of Vendrall 's sons . Aeryn : Well Lechna lied to me . There is no Lechna ! There is Lechna . Leave her alone ! - Give her more ! I 've doubled the strength . - No , please ! Again ! Stop it ! She 's telling the truth ! Again ! No , please , don 't . No ! You 'll kill the child ! Is John Crichton the father of your child ? I 've already told you , it 's Lechna 's , not Crichton 's . How many times do I have to tell you ? I knew Lechna before I went onto Moya . I was on Moya to watch Crichton . And as soon as I left , I went straight back to Lechna . ( crying ) : I have never ... ever loved John Crichton . I 've never loved him . You lie . Tell the truth . ( crying quietly ) When I ... Yes ? When I left Moya ... ( men laughing ) Ter ... terminal soldier ... Lechna , he-he ... I forgot all about Crichton . It was ... I completely forgot about Crichton . I forgot all about him . D 'Argo , it 's a long way off , but the vessel approaching seems to be a Command Carrier . We 've done all Crichton could ask of us . We 've stayed here too long . We must Starburst now . No . No , what if ... what if we initiate the engine signature change that I bought off Rekka ? Like we did before . Rygel : Are you fahrbot ? Turn Moya into a Scarran freighter ? Peacekeepers are approaching . They 'll attack anything Scarran . Chiana : We won 't let them get that close . If they long-range scan us , they 'll move off because we 're not Moya . It 's worth a shot . I need a decision , Captain . In thirty microts we 'll be in scanning range of the Command Carrier . Come on . Okay . You wanted a vote ? Do we Starburst or do we initiate engine signature change ? Starburst . Starburst . Stay . Pilot ? Moya and I say ... stay . Okay , we 're staying . Initiate the signature change . Scorpius : Given these differences , are you sure this will work ? It 's what happened before . Pip got killed . Stark channeled the Scarran while he was crossing her over . You or me ? I 'll do it . Chiana [ Aeryn ] : Hey , Crichton . Untie me . You know , I know I always tie up people I like . Stark [ Sikozu ] : If you kill her , I won 't help you . I won 't cross her over . - Yes , you will . What is he talking about ? What is he talking about ? Look , I know this doesn 't make any sense , but you 're gonna die in half an arn . And there 's nothing I can do to stop that . What ... What do you mean ? I 'm not gonna die . Yes , you are . Listen , Crichton , are you in some kind of trouble ? Who is this fek ? Is he making you do this ? If you untie me , I can help you . I always do . Can you just ... ( softly ) : It is not Aeryn . Looks a lot like her . Okay . ( laughs ) The ... the joke 's over . Okay ? I ... I was stupid to take it this seriously , ' cause it 's a joke , right ? You ... you have to stop , because ... because you can 't kill me . You ... you can 't . No . No , I can 't . I can . ( screaming ) No ! Now cross her over . ( gasping and groaning ) Frell . ( gaspsing ) I don 't know if it 's Crichton 's child . The frell with your drugs . They 're not working . No . You 'll kill her ! Who is the father ? On Vendrall ... I met a ... ugh ... a man . There is no Lechna . I made him up . Just Crichton . Only ever ... Crichton . Just him . Dadayo qillna frazac , charn , Oza-Maga . Oza-Maga . Has she said it yet ? Be quiet , I can 't hear . Oza-Maga . Kilay ti partree . Kilay ti partree . Katratzi . Katratzi ? That 's it , Stark . That 's the name of the base , Katratzi . Where is it ? Seat of Scarran power . Small . It 's Fortified . It 's dangerous . Disguises its presence ... by mirroring the orbit of one of the moons of Trilask . Trilask . - Trilask ... Katratzi ... Yes , I know that planet . ( Stark softly chants ) John . We can go . Morrock : Peacekeeper , wake up . How did you ... I watched the sequence codes . Are you sure ? At the same time , then . Thank you . What for ? - For doing this with me . I don 't wanna be their test stallik . No . No . Neither do I. Anyway , what other choice do I have ? But your child . Aren 't you afraid ? I 'd rather be dead than let them have it . Is it really his ? The man you loved ? Does these really make you tired ? At first . But then ... You know , I had such incredible dreams for my child . It 's impossible not to . How she was going to change the world , how she was gonna look after me when I was old . They were so foolish . Not foolish . I had the same dreams . Is it his ? Is it Crichton 's child ? Come here . Did you really have a child ? I told you , I ... had six pregnancies . Only three of them survived . ( gasps ) I want the truth from you . I know that these pills won 't kill me . I know that you 're their spy . So I wanna know the truth . Have you even had one child ? Have you even given birth to one child ? The truth . No . ( snapping ) Good . Then I orphan ... no one . Crichton : We 're back . Open the hangar doors . And we know where that Scarran base is . No time , John . There 's a Command Carrier on the way . We 've got you in the Docking Web and we 're about to Starburst . Got it . We will go as slow as we can , but you better buckle down in there . Starting Starburst countdown grid . Why is nothing ever easy with you ? I wish I knew . - Hold on , John . Pilot , Starburst ... now . We 've set a course for Katratzi . They 've been informed of your condition and there is a surgeon on hand . Now , Djancaz-Bru ... you haven 't listened , and you haven 't helped . And I 'm running out of time . So I 'm gonna forget about you . I am now willing to make a deal with anyone , with anything , to save my child . Not because I can , but because I have to .

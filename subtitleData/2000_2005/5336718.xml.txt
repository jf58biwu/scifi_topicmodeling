 [ CLICKING , WHIRRING ] [ WOMAN ON P.A. ] All Umbrella staff must wear their identity tags ... At all times . All radiation badges will be collected at 5 : 00 P.M. this afternoon . Thank you ! God . [ WOMAN ] Morning . Some people . Yeah . [ SNIFFING ] [ SNIFFS , BARKING ] - [ BEEPING ] - Maybe I won 't show this time . Why not ? [ CHUCKLES ] Because I 'm busy . [ ALARM BEEPING ] It 's nothing . Fire drill . [ DEVICES WHIRRING , BEEPING ALARM CONTINUES ] - What is that ? - Fire drill . [ SHRILL ALARM BLARING ] [ WOMAN ] Shit ! Hey , what the hell is going on ? - Get the computers covered ! Move it ! - Goddamn it , I 'm trying ! The experiments ! Move them ! [ SNARLING , BARKING ] Hey . Hey ! Shouldn 't the doors open or something ? [ WOMAN ] It 's supposed to take us to the nearest floor . [ POWER WHIRS DOWN ] Hello ? - Hello ? - [ MAN ] What 's happening ? Line 's dead . [ MAN COMPLAINING , INDISTINCT ] What 's the problem ? [ WOMAN ] The doors won 't open . What about the ones at the back ? Locked as well . - There 's no fire here ! No fire ! - [ GRUNTING ] - There 's no fire here ! No fire ! - The code doesn 't work ! What 's wrong with you ? The door won 't open ! And this water isn 't going anywhere . What ? It 's a sealed room . Help me with the door ! Oh , fuck the doors ! [ YELLS ] [ MAN ] We have to get out of here . [ MAN # 2 ] What 's going on ? - Has this happened before ? - We have to get out of here . We have to get out of here ! Take it easy . You take it easy ! Quiet ! - [ WHINING NOISE ] - What 's that ? - [ MAN ] What is that ? - [ DISTANT CRIES , SCRAPING ] [ PEOPLE SCREAMING ] [ SHUDDERS ] Oh , my God . [ METAL SNAPPING , SCRAPING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ SCREAMING CONTINUES ] - [ METAL SCRAPING ] - [ SCREAMS CONTINUE ] [ DESCENT STOPS ] [ GRUNTS , GROANS ] - Halon ! - [ CONFUSED CHATTER ] [ WOMAN ] Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop ! [ PEOPLE COUGHING ] Help . [ GASPING ] [ MAN GRUNTING ] Oh , no . [ MAN ] Let me see . [ GASPS ] We 're gonna have to get out of here . - We have to get out of this building ! - [ MAN ] Here , give me a hand . [ GRUNTING ] That 's as far as they 'll go . They 're caught on something . That 's wide enough . I can squeeze through . I 'll get help . [ GRUNTING , GROANING ] [ GROANS ] I 'm stuck . You 're gonna have to push . That 's it . - A bit more . - [ METAL CLANKING ] - What was that ? - [ RATTLING , CLANKING ] Oh , Christ ! It 's the brakes ! Quick , get out ! - I can 't move ! - We have to get out of here ! [ SCREAMING ] - Pull me back in . - Push her out of the way ! Pull me back inside ! Pull me back inside ! Pull be back inside ! - [ SCREAMING ] - [ METAL RESONATING ] [ WATER SPLASHING ] [ MOANS ] - [ GASPS ] - [ BEEPING ] [ GLASSES CLINKING , PEOPLE LAUGHING ] [ DOOR CLANKS OPEN ] Hello ? - Hello ? - [ CLATTERING , BIRDS SQUAWKING ] [ GASPS ] - Who are you ? - Move ! Don 't touch me ! Stop ! - Get away from me ! - Down ! [ WOMAN SCREAMS ] [ INDISTINCT ] What are you doing ? I 'm a cop ! I told you , I 'm a cop ! - [ DEVICE BEEPS ] - Come on ! You 're breaking my arm ! [ GROANS ] Report . Report now . What ? I want your report , soldier . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Sir , the house 's primary defenses have been activated . She 's probably still suffering the side effects . - [ MAN ] What are you doing with us ? - What about the cop ? Matthew Addison . I 'm not getting a match . [ WOMAN ] Who are you ? I just transferred . They probably don 't even have me on file yet . The locals are inefficient . It 's possible . Should I secure him here ? No . We take him with us . You can 't do this ! Blow me . - Hey ! - Prep for entry to the hive . Power 's down . So fix it . I 'm on it . Are you done yet ? Jumpy . [ LAUGHS ] Whoa ! [ POWER WHIRRING ] Stand clear ! - You got a problem ? - How 's that door ? - It 's sealed shut . - Let me . [ CLUCKS TONGUE ] [ GRUNTING ] No ! Jumpy ? [ LAUGHTER ] [ GASPS ] Lie still . Lie still ! Watch this light . Follow it . Now , how many fingers am I holding up ? Three . Good . Now tell me your name . I- - I don 't know . He 's fine . Memory loss , just like the other one . What happened ? Let 's open that door . Listen to me . I want to know who you people are , and I want to know what 's going on here . Now . You and I have the same employer . We all work for the Umbrella Corporation . The mansion above us is an emergency entrance to the hive . You are security operatives placed there to protect that entrance . What about this ? Your marriage is a fake . Just part of your cover to protect the secrecy of the hive . And what is the hive ? Show them . Accessing schematic of the hive . Raccoon city , nearest urban center . The mansion where we found you ... And through which we gained access to the train , which , in turn , brought us to the hive . The hive itself is located underground ... Deep beneath the streets of raccoon city , a top-secret research facility ... Owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation . The hive houses over 500 technicians , scientists and support staff . They live and work underground . Their research is of the highest importance . Its nature is classified . Our position on the map is indicated by heat signature . Why can 't I remember anything ? The hive has its own defense mechanisms , all computer-controlled . A nerve gas was released into the house . Primary effect of the gas- - complete unconsciousness lasting anything up to four hours . Secondary effects are varied but can include acute memory loss . For how long ? Subjective- - An hour , day , week . So you 're saying this place was attacked ? I 'm afraid things are a little more complicated than that . Sir ! We 've breached the hive . - J.D. - [ SCOPE BEEPS ] [ J.D. ] Got it . Halon content has dissipated . [ SIREN BLARING ] [ HORN BLASTS ] Makes it easier to work underground , thinking there 's a view . Looks like we 're taking the stairs . - Status . - Red Queen is locked onto us . She knows that we 're here . Who 's the Red Queen ? State-of-the-art artificial intelligence . She is the computer that controls the hive . This is gonna slow us down . Our route to the queen takes us straight through these labs . Rain , J.D. , see how bad the flooding is . Kaplan , find us an alternate route . What happened here ? Five hours ago , Red Queen went homicidal . Sealed the hive and killed everyone down here . Jesus . When we realized what was happening , my team was dispatched to shut her down . - Why did she do it ? - That we don 't know . But outside interference is a possibility . Jesus ! Hey . You okay ? Mm- - here . No . It was- - I 'm fine . Please , come on . It 's cold in here . - Are you- - - [ MOANING ] Do you remember anything ... from ... Before ... this ? No . No . Nothing before the train . And you ? No . Nothing . [ MAN ] I found an alternate route , but it 's gonna cost us time . We double back , cut through dining hall b ... Then we 're right on track . Sir ... no go . The whole level 's flooded . All right , we 're behind schedule . So let 's move it . Come on . Poor bastards . [ KEYPAD BEEPING ] Captain , dining hall B- - that 's what it says on the map . Maybe you 're reading it wrong . Maybe the corporation 's keeping a few secrets down here . Something you 're not supposed to see . J.D. , you and Rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit . Sir , halon levels are nonexistent in this room . I think the system malfunctioned . All right . There may be survivors . Give me a search line , but keep it tight . Move it . [ LIQUID FLOWING ] [ GASPS ] I said keep it tight . Sorry . I 'm not sure I want to remember what went on down here . I don 't blame you . What do they keep in these things ? [ WOMAN ] How do I know ? What 's taking so long ? Red Queen 's defenses are in place . She 's making it difficult . - [ METALLIC CLINK ] - [ LOUD BANG ] Let 's pack it up . You stay here . [ MAN ] The lights are automated . Nothing to worry about . [ DEVICE BEEPS ] Transmitter in position . Roger . Running the bypass . [ COMPUTER BEEPING ] - [ CHIMES ] - [ BEEPING ] [ RAPID KEYSTROKES ] [ BEEPING ] Checkmate . [ WHIRRING ] - [ BUZZER BUZZING ] - Move up . - [ WHIRRING ] What is that ? That 's what will shut the queen down . Delivers a massive electrical charge , scrambles the mainframe and forces it to reboot . Kaplan . - Kaplan ! - Some kind of dormant defense mechanism . - We must 've tripped it . - Put it back to sleep . Working on it . [ ALARM WARBLING ] [ MAN ] Would you open that door now , please ? - I 'm trying . - Hold your positions . Everyone stay calm . What 's that ? - Kaplan , quick ! - [ MAN ] We gotta get them out of there ! [ WOMAN ] Kaplan , you 've gotta hurry ! Okay . You 've got to help them ! - Come on ! I don 't know . - [ HIGH-PITCHED WHINE ] - Down ! Get down ! - [ GRUNTING ] - Look out ! Something 's killing them ! - Jesus , come on , man . Hurry it up . - Don 't do this to me ! Medic ! Medic ! [ GROANS ] [ SQUISHING ] [ GROANS ] - Uhhh ! - [ GASPING ] - Open the door ! - Open this door ! - I am trying . - Stay conscious . You 're going into shock . Stay awake ! [ NO AUDIO ] - I am almost there . Turn ! It 's coming back ! - Open the door ! I 'm trying ! Well , try harder ! It 's coming back ! - [ GRUNTS ] - [ BEAM SIZZLING ] - [ GROANS ] - [ SQUISHING ] - [ NO AUDIO ] Oh , God ! - Just do it ! - I 'm almost there . Come on ! - Shit ! - Got it . - [ BEEPING ] [ SQUISHING ] [ COMPUTER TWITTERING ] [ SHUDDERS ] All right . Let 's do it . Do what ? We have to complete the mission . There is no way I 'm going down there . Her defenses are down . [ MAN ] Déjà vu , anyone ? [ GASPS , SHUDDERING ] [ GAS HISSING , WHIRRING ] [ WHIRRING , GAS HISSING ] Keep going . Here . Give me a hand with this . Get out ! Get out ! You can 't be in here . Don 't listen to anything she says . She 's a holographic representation of the Red Queen , you have to get out ! Modeled after the head programmer 's daughter . She 'll try to deceive us , confuse us . I wouldn 't advise this . Disabling me will result in loss of primary power . She 'll say anything to stop us from shutting her down . I implore you . Implore away . Please ? Please ? You 're all going to die down here . - [ DETONATOR FIRES ] - [ POWER UNIT QUIETS ] [ WHIRRING SLOWS , STOPS ] [ SWITCHES CLANKING ] [ LIQUID GURGLING ] [ WHIRRING ] That pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds . After that , if I don 't have her board , she can reboot . They 're late . [ METALLIC SCRAPING ] I 'm on it . [ METAL CLANGING ] [ CLANGING ] J.D. , we got a survivor ! It 's okay . We 're here to help . You seem to be in some serious- - [ YELLS ] Get off of me ! Get off of me ! [ SNARLS ] J.D. , get her off of me before I stab her ass ! [ GRUNTS ] [ SNARLS ] Are you okay ? She- - she bit me , man . - She took a chunk clean right out of me . - [ SNARLING ] Stay down . I 'm warning you , stay down ! - She 's crazy . - [ SNARLING ] - Come any closer , and I 'll fire . - [ SNARLING CONTINUES ] I mean it ! Bad mistake . [ GROWLS ] [ HOWLING ] [ SCREAMING ] I shot her five times . How was she still standing ? Bitch isn 't standing now . - What was all the shooting ? - We found a survivor . - And you shot him ? - She was crazed . She bit me . She 's gone . She 's gone ! That 's bullshit ! She fell right here , but she 's gone ! Look , look at this . There 's blood , but it 's not much . Looks like it 's coagulated . Yeah . It 's not possible . Why not ? Because blood doesn 't do that till after you 're dead . Can we go now ? We 're not going anywhere till the rest get here . - There 's no one else coming . - [ METAL GRINDING ] - What the fuck are you talking about ? - Wait . - Quiet . - [ GRINDING CONTINUES ] [ SNARLING ] - [ SNARLS ] - Fuck . Don 't come any closer ! My God . - They 're behind us . - Jesus ! They 're everywhere . [ WOMAN ] Guys , they 're everywhere . They 're all around us . - I said stay back ! - [ HOWLING ] Why aren 't they dying ? Watch the tank ! The tank ! - Let 's go ! - Hurry up ! Wait ! Come on , let 's go ! Move ! Keep moving ! Come on ! - [ GUNFIRE CONTINUES ] - Move ! [ MOANING ] I can help you get the virus . I have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works . Shit ! We lost the others ! Keep moving ! You waited ? Didn 't know the code . Come on , come on . Shit ! Come on . Come on . Hurry up . Shit ! Shit ! Come on , man . - What 's taking so long ? - I 'm trying ! - [ GROWLING ] - [ GAS HISSING ] [ GROWLING ] Come on . - Move ! What 's the code ? - Hurry up ! I 'm running out of ammo ! Zero , four , three , two- - no , fuck ! - What ? - Zero , four , three- - what is the code ? Zero , four ... Zero , three , one ... Nine , six , five . You got it ? See how easy that was ? - Shit ! - J.D. , no ! J.D. , grab my hand and hold tight ! Don 't let go ! [ NO AUDIO ] - [ SNARLING ] - [ SCREAMING ] - J.D. ! - [ SCREAMING ] R-R-Rain ! Fuck ! No ! [ SCREAMING ] [ BANGING ] [ SNARLING , GROWLING ] Where are the bodies ? Where did they go ? Shut up ! Fuck ! [ POUNDING ] Whatever they are , there 's too many of them out there . Whatever they are ? It 's pretty obvious what they are . Lab coats , badges . Those people used to work here ! All the people working here are dead . Well , that isn 't stopping them from walking around . Well , where did they come from ? Why didn 't we see them on the way in ? When you cut the power , you unlocked the doors . - You let them out . - [ POUNDING CONTINUES ] We 're never gonna make it to the surface . [ DOOR CREAKS CLOSED ] [ FAINT CLICKING ] [ CLICKING CONTINUES ] [ GROWLING ] [ GROWLING ] - [ GROWLING , SNARLING ] - [ WHIMPERS ] [ SNARLING , GROWLING ] - [ SNARLING ] - [ GRUNTING ] [ YELLS ] You are security operatives- - security operatives placed there to protect that entrance . [ GASPS ] - [ GROWLING ] - [ WHIMPERING ] - [ GASPS ] - [ SNARLING ] [ GROWLING ] - [ GASPS ] - [ GROWLING ] [ YELLS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] Lisa . [ SNARLING ] I 've got one in the breech and an extra mag . [ POUNDING ] [ POUNDING CONTINUES ] Wha- - - Lisa ? - [ WHEEZING ] [ SNARLS ] [ THUDDING ] [ SHUDDERING ] I can help you get the virus . I have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works . But ? - But there 's gonna be a price . - Name it . Who was she ? My sister . Corporations like Umbrella ... Think they 're above the law . But they 're not . There are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same ... All over the world . Some of us provide information , others give their support . Some take more direct action . Like you . If your friends had been a little more thorough , they would 've seen right through my false ID . Then all the Red flags would 've gone off- - Quantico , N.S.A. , Vicap , all the rest . There 's no way I could 've infiltrated the hive . So you sent your sister . We needed something concrete . Anything to expose Umbrella to the press , proof of the research that was going on down here . What kind of research ? The illegal kind- - genetic , viral . My sister was going to smuggle out ... A sample of the virus they were developing . [ SIGHS , SNIFFLES ] So how was she going to make it out of here ? She had a contact within the hive , someone I never met . They had access to security codes , surveillance , everything she needed . So why didn 't she make it ? Maybe she trusted the wrong person . Maybe they set her up , kept the virus for themselves . Do you know how much the " T " - virus would be worth on the open market ? - What , worth all this ? - Yeah . To someone . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! - Close that door ! Close that door ! - They 're right behind us ! They 're right behind us ! [ INDISTINCT ] - Get off ! Get off ! - Stop it ! Son of a bitch ! You okay ? Yeah . Right behind us . What about this door ? They 're waiting out there too . And that way ? It 's a dead end . There 's no way out of the queen 's chamber . So we wait . If someone doesn 't hear from you , they 'll send backup or something , right ? What ? What 's wrong ? We don 't have much time . You know those blast doors we passed ... On the way in from the mansion ? They seal shut in just under an hour . If we 're not out of here by then , we 're not getting out . W-What ? They can 't just bury us alive down here . [ SIGHS ] Containing the incident is the only fail-safe plan they had ... [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] Against possible contamination . And you 're only telling us this now , when we 're trapped half a fuckin ' mile underground ? [ WOMAN ] We have to find a way out of this room . What are you doing ? Where are you taking those ? I 'm turning her back on . Well , that is not a good idea . She 'll know a way out of here . That homicidal bitch killed my team . That homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here . Considering the way she 's been treated , I 'm sure she 's gonna be happy ... To help us out . That circuit breaker you were talking about . Can you bypass it ? Yeah . So do it . [ WHIRRING ] [ KAPLAN ] All right . The circuit breaker 's disabled . This time , if I hit the switch , she won 't be able to shut down . - She 's gonna fry . - [ BANGING , WHIRRING ] Kaplan ? The initial charge must have damaged her boards . [ RED QUEEN ] Ah , there you are . Things have gone out of control . Gimme that fuckin ' switch right now . I 'm gonna fry her ass . [ RED QUEEN ] I did warn you , didn 't I ? Tell us what the hell is going on down here . [ RED QUEEN ] Research and development . What about the " T " - virus ? The " T " - virus was a major medical breakthrough . Although it clearly also possessed ... Highly-profitable military applications . How does it explain those things out there ? [ RED QUEEN ] Even in death , the human body still remains active . Hair and fingernails continue to grow . New cells are produced , and the brain itself holds a small electrical charge ... That takes months to dissipate . The " T " - virus provides a massive jolt ... Both to cellular growth and to those trace electrical impulses . Put quite simply , it reanimates the body . [ SQUISHING ] [ RAIN ] It brings the dead back to life ? [ RED QUEEN ] Not fully . The subjects have the simplest of motor functions . Perhaps a little memory . Virtually no intelligence . They are driven by the basest of impulses . - The most basic of needs . - Which is ? - The need to feed . - [ HISSING , ROARING ] How do you kill them ? Severing the top of the spinal column , or massive trauma to the brain are the most effective methods . You mean shoot them in the head . Why did you kill everybody down here ? The " T " - virus escaped into the air conditioning system . And an uncontrolled pattern of infection began . The virus is Protean , changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission , depending on its environment . It 's almost impossible to kill . I couldn 't allow it to escape from the hive , so I took steps . Steps ? You must understand . Those who become infected , [ VOICE GETS FAINTER ] I can 't allow you to leave . Whoa , we- - we 're not infected . Just one bite , one scratch from these creatures is sufficient . And then , you become one of them . A check of my systems indicates ... My main drive circuit breaker has been disabled . May I ask why ? Insurance . We need a way out of here . If you refuse to help at any time , we flip the switch . Understand ? After you . - What the hell is this place ? - [ KAPLAN ] The utility tunnels . They run underneath the hive for water , gas and power lines . - It 's been in here before . - Keep moving ! We 're going in circles ! This is the route the computer gave us . Through the utility tunnels- - Why are you listening to her ? Enough , already ! We have to keep moving , 'cause those things are right behind us . Oh ! Goddamn ! That mesh isn 't gonna hold . Keep moving . [ GASPS ] [ SCREAMING ] Up ! Up in the pipes ! - Up ! - There 's too many of them ! Hold it ! [ GROWLING , SHRIEKING ] Fuck ! - [ GROWLING ] - [ GRUNTING ] - [ SHOUTING ] - [ CRACKING ] Run ! Up on the pipes . Up on the pipes ! Quickly , everyone ! Up on the pipes ! Go ! Come on ! There 's a way up ! Watch out ! Keep ' em back ! - Go on up ! Move it ! - [ CREATURES SHRIEKING ] - Look out ! - [ SCREAMING ] - Shit . Okay . - [ GROWLING ] [ BONE SNAPPING ] Get over here ! There 's too many of ' em ! Come on here . Go , go , go ! Go on ! Go , go ! I can manage ! Go on ! [ SNARLING ] I got you .

We have to do something about your wounds . I 'm fine . I said , I 'm fine ! [ CHATTERING ] You like that , don 't you ? Huh ? Huh ? You like the way it tastes , don 't you ? Like the taste of that ? She was right . We 're all gonna die down here . No . We 're getting out . All of us . [ PANTING ] [ GROWLING , HOWLING ] Kaplan ? Are you okay ? [ RIGGING CREAKING , BREAKING ] Kaplan ? No ! Aah ! - Run ! - No ! [ SCREAMING ] - [ KAPLAN ] Get out ! - God ! Hold on ! - [ SCREAMING ] - [ ROARING ] Help him ! I can 't . - What are you waiting for ? - I can 't focus . - I can 't see ! - [ GROWLING , CHOMPING ] [ GUNSHOTS ] - [ WOMAN ] Kaplan , go up ! - [ MAN ] Come on , Kaplan ! Get up there ! You almost got it . Keep going ! Come on ! Come on , you can do it . [ GROANING ] Kaplan , move ! [ WOMAN ] Oh , you 've got it . Okay . Kaplan- [ MAN ] Just stay there . - Hold on . We 're gonna come get you . We need to cut this wire , then we can throw it to him . And then we can go get him . Hold on ! - That 's lucky . - [ GROWLING ] [ PANTING ] I want you to go . No . We 're not leaving you , Kaplan . Yes , you are . - No ! - [ KAPLAN ] You can 't kill all of them . I 'm not goin ' anywhere . I want you to go ! Now ! Please . Just do it ! - Just do it now ! Please . - [ SNARLING ] Go-o-o ! [ CREATURES GROWLING ] [ GUNSHOT ] You 're gonna have to work for your meal ! [ GRUNTING ] [ DISTANT CLANGING ] [ WOMAN PANTING ] Come on . Give me your arm . Okay . Up over my shoulder . Ready ? Here we go . Yeah . [ RETCHING ] [ CREATURE EXHALING , INHALING ] [ RAIN ] When I get outta here , I think I 'm gonna get laid . Yeah . [ CHUCKLES ] You might want to clean up a little bit first . Hey , wait . [ WHISPERING , INDISTINCT ] Are you okay ? [ INDISTINCT WHISPERS CONTINUE ] [ PEOPLE CHATTERING ] Can you- - [ WOMAN ] Blue for the virus . Green for the antivirus . Blue for the virus . Green for the antivirus . There 's a cure . What are you talking about ? There 's a cure ! [ CHUCKLES ] The process can be reversed . [ EXHALES ] There 's a cure ! You 're gonna be okay . I was beginning to worry . This is where they kept the " T " - virus . How do you know all this ? Because I was gonna steal it . I was your sister 's contact . - You betrayed her . - I don 't know . You caused all of this . I can 't remember . The truth . I don 't remember the truth ! [ WOMAN GRUNTING , GROANING ] [ WOMAN CONTINUES GROANING ] God ! I don 't understand ! It 's gone . It 's gone . It 's not there . I can 't . I just can 't . It 's over . No . [ WOMAN 'S VOICE ] I can help you get the virus . I have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works . - [ LISA ] But ? - But there 's gonna be a price . Name it . You have to guarantee me that you will bring this corporation down . Spence ? Spence ? [ GLASS VIAL SHATTERING ] [ LIQUID SPILLING ] Thank you ! Spence . [ CLICKING TONGUE ] We can still make it out of here . Come with me . We can have everything we 've ever wanted . Money 's out there , waiting . You wouldn 't believe how much . Is that how you thought all my dreams were gonna come true ? Please . I wouldn 't want to shoot you . Might need the bullets . Back off ! I won 't take any part in this . Okay . But you can 't just ... Wash your hands of this . We work for the same company . You knew what they did . I was trying to stop them . No ! You- - you really believe the ... People like him ... Will ever change anything ? No . Nothing ... Ever ... Changes . Where is ... The antivirus ? It 's on the train ... Where you found me . Couldn 't have been standing more than three feet from it . [ CHUCKLES ] I so nearly made it out . Didn 't realize that bitch of a computer ... Had defense systems outside the hive . In or out . In ... or out ? I don 't know what we had , but it 's over . [ GROWLING , SCREAMING ] Oh , God ! Back ... The fuck off . I 'm missing you already . No ! [ GRUNTING ] Your boyfriend 's a real asshole . [ MATT ] He shot the locking mechanism out . I can 't believe that son of a bitch is going to get away with this . [ RED QUEEN ] I don 't think so . I 've been a bad , bad girl . [ CASE SLIDING OPEN ] [ CHUCKLES ] [ RUMBLING , CLATTERING ] [ BANGING , SLIDING ] [ METAL DOOR SLAMMING SHUT ] - Oh , my God . - [ GROWLING ] [ SPENCE SCREAMING , CREATURE SWALLOWING ] What the fuck is that ? One of the hive 's early experiments . Produced by injecting the " T " - virus directly into living tissue . The results were unstable . Now that it has fed on fresh D.N.A. , it will mutate ... [ ROARING ] Becoming a stronger , faster hunter . Great . If you knew it was loose , why didn 't you warn us ? 'Cause she was saving it . For us . Isn 't that right ? I didn 't think any of you would make it this far . Not without infection . Why didn 't you tell us about the antivirus ? This long after infection , there 's no guarantee it would work . But there 's a chance , right ? I don 't deal in chance . Fuck it . [ BEEPING ] No pressure , guys . [ RED QUEEN ] You require ... The four digit access code . I can give you the code , but first you must do something for me . - What do you want ? - One of your group is infected . I require her life for the code . The antivirus is right there on the platform . It 's right there ! I 'm sorry . But it 's a risk I cannot take . [ CLOCKS TICKING LOUDLY ] [ RAIN ] She 's right . It 's the only way . You 're gonna have to kill me . - [ SOFTLY ] No . - Otherwise , we all die down here . [ BANGING , ROARING ] [ GROWLING ] [ RED QUEEN ] The glass is reinforced , but it won 't hold forever . - [ BANGING , ROARING ] - [ GRUNTING ] Do it ! No . Get up .

 Previously on Farscape ... No ! I will not be a slave to your hormones ! Two drops from these little vials and we can tell if our DNA is compatible . Please ! You kissed our Princess ! W - w - what the hell does that mean ? I want you ... to consider marrying her . You will rule . Not because you desire it Clayvor , but because I do ! if you 're not going to be king , Clayvor ... I 'm not going to marry you . What is it , Pilot ? The ... builders . Their creators . After we 're married , and I mean ... right after we 're married , they turn us into statues . Oh , hello Crichton ! My daughter ... or that abomination . Choose . there 's never been anything we couldn 't overcome together . Except each other ! Here 's your wedding present ... From Prince Clayvor . Janovia Chatto . Disrupter . Peacekeeper Special Directorate . So , what 's your assignment ? Stay close to Prince Clayvor , my vapid little fiancée ' , and if he assumes the crown , kill him . I sense ... unhappiness ... that your friend Crichton is marrying our Princess . Oh yes ? And why would that make me unhappy ? Moya can reproduce gun ships . Moya must be decommissioned . A little reunion is in order , don 't you think ? Three near - death experiences in one day ... You can 't just quit ! I 'm not quitting ... I just can 't go on . She is gone . and I ... am shortly to follow . this is what ... our child would look like ? One possibility . The choice is ours . I 'm exploring the Barren Lands If you think you can keep up . Do you accept this burden in matrimony ? Without hesitation . It 's calibrated only for Sebaceans . Endure the pain . And rule wisely . Tonight on Farscape ... They look so ... . Stiff . I think he should have taken his pose more seriously . I believe he did the best he could . So what happens now ? For them , eighty cycles of government . Boring , but ultimately advantageous . And what do we do ? Scorpius has been asked to leave our system within the solar day . Once his Command Carrier vacates ... We hope that Moya returns and picks us up . You really going to stay , Ryg ? Why not ? Crichton will need advising and uh the food 's good . So , he can hear us ? Every word . The acoustics of this chamber funnel all sounds to them . May we say goodbye ? I 'll wait outside . John . Hey D 'argo . He can hear us . Do you feel any pain ? No , but I 'd really love to pick my nose . He remains without a sense of humor . It 's good to hear your voice , John . Yours too . Hey , can I say Hi to Chiana ? Chiana . You look great in bronze . You look great in pink . Brings out your eyes . frell ! frell ! frell ! I 'm gonna double his statue ! I should be regent ! While enormously symbolic your Highness , may I propose a more permanent tactic ? What ? Are you sure he 's still alive ? Of course ! Each cell is self - encapsulated . As long as the parts stay in their metalized state , he can be re - constituted . Very impressive . My uh Great - grandfather was broken in half when the Senate collapsed after a ground shaker . All he suffered was a severe limp . Foundry acid should ensure this ruler fairs worse . N - n - n - n - n - n - n - no , give it to me , give it to me . I know you can hear me , Crichton , and I know you 're scared . Our laws state that a couple must rule together . Hm ? That 's why the crown must soon pass to me , because you can 't rule with one little head ! My name is John Crichton ... an astronaut ... radiation wave hit me ... I got shot through a wormhole ... lost in some distant part of the universe ... on a ship a living ship full of strange alien life - forms ... help ... Listen please ... Is anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm Being hunted by an insane military commander ... Doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . I propose that we start here and traverse around . Excellent . You always this agreeable ? Am I being agreeable ? Well , everything I 've suggested , since the moment we met , you 've consented to . They 've all been good ideas . And your proficiency at this is ? I 've been rated expert . Really ? That 's clearly a local custom . What 's this one called ? Kiss your climbing partner ? Different local custom . Kiss a woman you 're attracted to . Alright . You ready ? Whoever perpetrated this atrocity shall pay in kind ! Beheaded ! Surely you don 't think ... Silence ! This planet is under stringent law until my daughter 's husband is made whole ! No one is to leave ! Or even contact their vessels ! Whether they purport to be a friend of the crown or not ! Where is the one called Aeryn Sun , the former Peacekeeper ? We don 't know ! She was upset that Crichton was to marry the Princess , I saw it with my own eyes ! You cannot possibly think that ... I can 't possibly not ! Find her . Bring her to us for questioning . If you want someone with a motive for stealing chriton 's head try that vigilant Scorpius ! Everyone is suspect , especially off worlders ! If Prince Clayvor assumes the throne , I cannot guarantee your safety . Find your friend 's head ! Very fortunate I sampled your DNA when you were in the Aurora chair . There would have been no other way to track you , Crichton . Though the crystallization of your cells was designed to withstand eighty cycles of air born corrosives ... seems ... three arns ... well ... . a full on acid attack is all it takes . You 're beginning to pit ! And while I won 't be able to retrieve your body ... I promise you ... the wormhole calculations you have in your mi ... Who 's there ? Who 's there ? You should use one of Moya 's transport pods instead that little one . What do you care what I do ? All life is precious . Yours should continue . And Moya 's shouldn 't ? We have been through this . Moya can produce gun ship offspring . We did not intend the Universe to be subject to that affliction . I 'm sorry . I must leave now . No . Kahaynu ! If Moya 's life is to end capriciously , and Pilot 's also , you and I are going to remain with them ! Doubtful . DRD , now ! In reverse ! What ? Stop this ! Re - commission Moya . I cannot ! I will not ! Turn the engine off ! I will spare you ... if you spare Moya . Stop ! I beg you ! How does it feel for your prayers to go unanswered , Kahaynu ? Dear Goddess . In my rage , what have I done ? I cannot find Crichton 's head anywhere . I feel miserable . Aren 't you tired ? Just responsible . I 'm the one that talked him into it . We had no other options . You said that yourself . We take what we get . My body ! My body ! I 'm working on it . Working on it ? It 's impossible . Strangely not . If I do this right , your current state is not terminal . And if not done right ? Terminal . Get experts . We 're beyond that , don 't you think ? You 're way too vulnerable in this state . See exhibits A and B. Have you got a plan ? Revitalize you . Your speech abilities are so limited right now , you couldn 't convince the Empress you 're a headless statue . Woah , nice dress . Save it . When the Empress sees you , my true fiancée and his Scarran will be in deep dren . Then you can be re - made into a statue . That 's not much of a plan . As long as the parts are aligned right . The machine should do the rest . Woah - woah - woah - woah - wh - hey - hey - hey , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Just a second ! Hey ! Come back ! Can you turn your neck ? Can you speak ? Thank you . Can you walk ? I told you it 's best we 're not seen together until after you 're married and assume the line of succession ! You mean if I do ! Crichton 's body is gone , somebody used the processor to revitalize him ! Without his head , is that really a concern ? They 're still reconstructing the data , but it seems so ... great frell - up ... that his head was attached at the time ! Someone retrieved his head ? Do something oh magnificent representative of a supposedly master race , or you will surely die at my mother 's hand . And I , I will cheer her on ! Dregon ! What 's wrong ? Nothing . I 've secured it , you can come up now . Are your lines stuck ? I 'm coming down . It 's okay . I 'm ... . just ... . Dregon ? Are you injured ? We 're too high . What ? You 've done this before , haven 't you ? Isn 't that right ? You were rated expert . Correct ? At the training facility . This is your first wall ? Yeah . Outside . For the love of Chilnak . Alright ... Hang on . Right , grab my hand . Dregon , just grab my hand . Good . Good . Alright . No ! Help me ! Please . Don 't let me fall . I won 't . It 's fine . All you have to do is hold on with that hand there , that left hand . Can you do that ? You got it ? Take a deep ... take a deep breath ! Take a deep breath . That 's it . Alright , now hold on . I 've got you . No , no , no ! Not my leg ! The wall ! Hold onto the wall ! Where the hell are we ? Don 't worry about it , somewhere no one will find you . That was not my question . Is that your real name ? John Crichton ? Yeah . And which Sebacean house is that from ? Well , you know if I tell you ... I 'll have to kill you . Why is Scorpius here ? You don 't know ? He 's not part of my brief . However , he seems to be part of yours . Look , I appreciate ... that you have questions . I 'm sure you 'll appreciate that I 'm not going to answer them . I heard some of what Scorpius said . He wasn 't protecting you as an ally , he was capturing you as prey . You wouldn 't like the truth . The data scanned Mister John Crichton as non - Sebacean . So , if you 're not Sebacean , you 're not Peacekeeper . If you 're not Peacekeeper , you 're not special directorate . If you 're not special directorate , you can 't be a disrupter . And if you 're not a disrupter ... . Then you know too much about me . Well , there 's more , but that pretty much sums it up , yeah . That is either the most pathetic fabrication I have ever heard , or the most pathetic life I could ever imagine . Either way ... Oh , look their on some whacked out antecedence to a chick with a stiletto in her wrist . Better . So , did you kill Scorpy ? Leave bodies lying around , they look for a killer . It 's not like he 's going to report the assault . Then why choose me over him ? Because I couldn 't give a Kragg 's ass about anything but my job ... preventing the Scarrans from getting a claw on this Empire . You 're my best chance of making that happen . Assuming I 'm willing to play garden gnome for the next eighty cycles . John , if I fail , so many innocent lives would be lost . Help me do my job ... and I 'll help you get what you want , whatever it is . You know things never work out like you plan . That 's what makes it fun . Isn 't there ... any other way to contact help ? Not unless a ship passes , and sees us . I told you before , these are the devastated reefs , boats never come here . Well then , inland is our only hope . Unless of course , you want to stay . Please . Don 't leave me . Don 't tempt me ! May the Goddess recognize the gentleness of your spirit , and guide you to your ancestors . Pa U Zotoh Zhaan . You live . As does Moya . What kind of repellant game is this ? Upon my first exploration of Moya , I knew the circumstances that produced her gun ship offspring . And I knew she was a worthy soul . Then why did you put her through this ? To see if you were worthy . These are gentle beasts , who will ultimately follow the directions of those in control . Should you desire it , Priestess , you could produce an army of killing machines . But Zhaan would never ... Of course she wouldn 't . We know that , now . We are confident that you will protect Moya , vigorously against those who seek to exploit her . You are worthy of that responsibility . If that is so , then I demand that you leave this ship immediately ! As you wish . But first ... . Moya wishes to speak with you . Zhaan . One request . Anything , Moya . Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnngggg . It 's good that you came . Do you know where Crichton is ? Honestly ? No . But I 'm as anxious to find him as you are . For his wormhole knowledge . That 's secondary at this point . I 'm without accompaniment , totally unarmed . Should the Empress wish to execute us , I have no doubt she would succeed . So now we are allies . Effectively , yes . I assume you know of Seskoritz Gee Cargn , the Scarren emissary . And his alliance with Prince Clayvor . So , Who 's next in line for the throne . they are our natural suspects . What do you want , Scorpius ? I will help you get Crichton off this planet alive , collect the information I need from his mind , and release him to you . Unharmed . You 're half Scarran , aren 't you ? By which measure I should not be judged . Because it would find him lacking ! Ka D 'argo is it ? Luxan , a great race of warriors , I am honored ! And to you , biological mistake ! I commend your plan . Having an agent marry the Princess . How did you defeat my DNA alterations of her ? Scorpius is not in league with Crichton . We despise him . Truly ? Have I misjudged the situation that badly ? Even if you establish diplomatic ties with this Dynasty , that would mean that we ... Peacekeepers ... would have to respond , preventing it . And that would mean a total conflagration . But who would be seen as aggressor ? All but sealing their access to the Uncharted Territories . Luxan brute ! Where is Crichton ? I don 't know ! Has he been reconstituted into flesh and blood form ? I don 't know ! Is there anyone who does ? Chiana . Think she does . But ... Enough ! I will offer you a deal . I would rather race you to the Nebari girl , Chiana . The means to our different goals ... may be the same , Emissary . What about the coming conflagration between our species ? If you wish to provoke Peacekeeper might ... well , we shall oblige . By defeating you . I would still rather race you to the girl . Please ! Please ? Please stop dragging you ? No , but it ... I ... know , it hurts . Yes You want it to not hurt ? Yes Well next time ... hold on to the frelling wall ! Rygel ! Have you seen Chiana ? No Have you tried looking under your sheets ? I think that Scorpius and the Scarran may have her . They think she knows where John and Aeryn are . We were looking together when she split off . Yeah . I 'm so nervous , I had to stop for a bite . Which I 'm too nervous to eat . Yeah , alright , what 's the matter ? I asked around . The last time the Empress threatened to execute off - worlders she did ! Rygel . I need your help . They 're going to torture her , and she doesn 't know anything . I 'll float above the streets for a better view . Yes . Yes ! We 'll find her ! What the frell is that ? She does not know Crichton 's whereabouts , as I suspected . So , get rid of her . I believe she may have another use . I don 't even wanna know . Cargn , we 're through ! Everything you said would pass , has not ! I 'm simply trying to assure your ascension ! If Crichton is not found by tomorrow , you 'll be crowned . Through no efforts of yours , sadly . Which means I no longer need your allegiance . The disillusion of our relationship is not yours to affect ! Look ! My mother knows about us ! I can 't be married until I renounce you . I will not allow it . I 'm doing you a favor . She 's going to start the ceremony by executing off - worlders . Get out of here . Hide . Run . There 's no way for me to escape , and you know it . And I thought you were good . I am . I have one final question for you , duplicitous Prince Clayvor . Wha ... Do you know , that as promised , I am about to kill you ? No ! N - n - nooooooooooooooo ! Yeees . Just a little tingling in the hands and feet . I 'm good to go . Too late . Local animals are carnivorous after dark . Animals . Okay , fine . First light . I have people to protect . As I must mine . Can I trust you ? Oh yeah , I 'm a regular Boy Scout . I do what I have to do . And I assume you do it well . I um ... I have found Cargn . It will take both of us to kill him . Scarrans ... ... have exceptional strength . And why do you think I 'll help you ? He has Chiana . And you want her . And you don 't ? I want John Crichton . You 'll never get Crichton . He 'll die , first . You under estimate the strength of a relationship . Even your friend ... does not yet understand . I want you to have this . A little stuns and a lot kills . Tomorrow will be dangerous . Scorpius , Cargn , the Empress ' anger . Be careful . I might not be able to protect you . One step at a time , . Jena One ... step at a time . I 'm sorry I ... brought this on you . Do you always pursue women you don 't know ? If I 'm drawn to them . Would you by lying here helpless , giving up , if Crichton were back there waiting for you ? You wouldn 't understand . Does your leg hurt ? It 's broken . I 'm trained to deal with that . That 's the answer ! You 're not trained to deal with emotions , so you 're afraid of them . Emotional pain , you wear like a badge . It means you 've been there . And you can 't get callused , because each fresh hurt stings like the first . Why would you want that ? Because of all the days before it hurts . The good days , when you 're in love . It 's ... too bad ... you can 't get back to at least ... tell Crichton how you feel . What difference would it make ? He 's a frelling statue ! But he can hear . He can see . He 'll know , Aeryn . At least he 'll know . You 're late . I 'm moving a little slow . Are you ready to do this ? I 've grieved with the best of them . Alright , show time . I hope it all works out . One way or the other . We 're not compatible . You always know , just what to say . Not always . But sometimes I know , who to say it to . Give me some time before you enter . Aeryn ! What ? Look ! Hello ! Hello , do you need help ? I 'll ... stay there ! I 'll come and get you ! Yes . Aeryn . Listen , I know this ... didn 't turn out like we wanted . I know I was a ... . hindrance . But I was hoping ... we could go it again ? No , this can 't beee ! I 'm sorry , Jenvia . There was nothing we could do . Surely the Empress knows this is the Scarrans work ! How could she not ? Of course she knows ! And he will be the first one put to death ! But why the rest of us ? Because fool that he was ... . no offence ... Prince Clayvor was her son ! You will all be arrested and executed . I feel compelled to disagree with the Empress on that decision . Crichton . Crichton ! Hey , Sparky . Oh , thank the Spirits ! Jena . Sorry about the Prince , but I hear he deserved it . Your Excellency , who defiled your position ? Who rescued you ? Later ! Rygel , what about the others ? Nothing on Aeryn , I 'm sorry . D 'argo 's with Scorpius . They think the Scarran has Chiana . So they 're gonna kill 'im ! Crichton , wait ! Where are you going ? I don 't know . I 'll let you know when I get there . I 'm assuming my execution is off . Chiana ! Stay back ! He cannot damage your brain from this distance . But any closer . There are two of us and only one of him . How badly do you want him dead ? No closer , or the girl dies ! That will not help Prince Clayvor become King . Agreed . This is about killing you . The girl ... has she told you where Crichton is ? Of course not . She doesn 't know . But , she did say you aren 't allies and that , in all probability , you did not come here to impede my plan . It must be painful to realize ... that you are defeated . Yes ! Defeated ! By nothing more , than your own suspicions ! Too hot in here , Scorpius ? What 's the matter ? When he becomes incapacitated , I shall turn full attention to you ! Nothing , it 's nothing ! Don 't listen to him ! Because , if you do , you know this mutant 's weakness , that his Scarran half loves the heat . Thrives in heat ! Craves heat . But his Peacekeeper half ... is destroyed by the same warmth . Is this true ? Thermal regulator suit , cooling rods inserted directly into his brain . Tell me the rumors are true . Please tell me your search for thermic constancy is tormentful ! Luxan coward ! Now , you will die ! Hey ! Crichton ! You ... haven 't ... defeated ... meeee ! Obviously not . But you dumped me in the acid , so let 's see how you like it ! Chiana ! Nooo ! You 're the best ! How Batman was that ? You guys okay ? We 're fine John . It 's good to see you . You too . What about Scorpius ? He dead ? If he isn 't ... he should be , by the time we come out . I 'm not your enemy . I 'm not your friend . You leave me the hell alone . Or the next time we part , one of us will be dead . I am sorry if it upsets your line of succession , but I am not gonna be a statue again ! I understand your concerns as I 'm sure you must understand ours . However , if you 're the kind of man that would walk away from his own child , we would not want you to rule . Child ? What the hell are you talking about ? My daughter is pregnant with your seed . How - woah - how - no , no , we never ... . Samples from the DNA comparison . Did you really think a system this stable , would leave so important a detail , to chance ? Make me a statue . You change your mind so quickly ? A child deserves two parents . My child deserves a father , make me a statue . Counselor Tyno ! Arrange for this ... honorable man to re - undergo the transmutation process . I 'm afraid that 's impossible , Empress . Recall that Crichton is not Sebacean . Based on our findings , Human physiology would not tolerate the process a second time . What the hell are you talkin ' about ? If you stood beneath that machine again , you would die ! She won 't be defrosted for another eighty cycles . I 'm not gonna live that long , and I won 't be there for them ! I know ! I 'm sorry . You take my place . I can 't . Nobody knows me , right ? The public , they don ' t know who I am . Your unveiling was to be your introduction . Right . Counselor Tyno can be your new King . They 're chromosomes are not compatible ! It doesn 't matter ! She 's already pregnant . And it satisfies everything that you need . And it gives my child a good father . And they love each other . What do you say ? Does this work for you ? Yes . Thank you . I 'm sorry ... . that I won 't be around . I 'll ... . never forget . It 's your call . As long as the secrets we forge in this room do not escape ... . it can be done . Well there ya go . Good guys win for once . And I have a child that I will never know . Princess Katralla wants to know if you 'd like to see your offspring . Yes . Hi there . Hi . Are you my dad ? Yeah , that 's right . I love you , Daddy . You take care of my little girl . So how come Crichton didn 't kill Scorpius ? It was a mistake . One that I fear will come back to haunt us . Well yeah , but he can 't follow us . Right ? Well , Pilot says that we 're safe for now . Did he tell you what happened to Moya ? Zhaan either . Rygel thinks they were scared , I just think they were lost . Either way , they 're keeping it to theirselves . Hey . I 'm very proud of you . I 'm proud of you . You handled yourself well . Well you handled me - self well , too . What 's the matter ? Ah , I just can 't stop thinking about Crichton 'll never see his daughter again . Hits pretty close to home , huh ? The fact that I may never see my son again is a grief I would wish upon no one . Pains me to think of what he 's going through right now . Pains me too . And you thought we weren 't compatible . Zhaan said the surgical reconstructors did an excellent job on your leg . There 's no sign that it was ever broken . Yeah , I was uh ... worried about you when you didn 't show up for the wedding . Anyway , I 'm ... I 'm just glad you 're okay . And I have noticed that you 're not talking to me .

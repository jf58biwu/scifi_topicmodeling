 Aargh ! Sarge , we don 't know what that 'll do to her . Do you have a better idea ? Sarge , it 's OK . Thank goodness you found me . Cleo , talk to us . It 's speaking to me . What ? It sensed me . It used the image of my mother to bring me here . It crashed in the ocean . They recovered it , acquiring its technology . Is this the Bailey that took Raina ? I don 't know . I 'm asking it , but I 'm not getting through . I 'm just a receiver . Cleo ? It 's dying , Hel . It 's alive ? They 're killing it . Oh , this is ridiculous ! I don 't care if it 's alive or dead . It 's got access to Cleo - all her memories , everything she knows about us , The Voice ... No , wait . Sarge , don 't . Lower your weapons ! - Get behind me . I 'll shield up . - Sarge ... Schrager , no . Sarge ! Oh , Sarge . Just be still . Sarge ? 500 years finto the future , she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth . Mankind has been driven underground . And Cleopatra is about to discover there 's no place like home . ln the year 2525 There are women with the will to survive Fighting for a brand-new day Nothing 's gonna get in their way And in the year 2525 Three women keep hope alive Joining forces to reclaim the Earth Looking ahead to humankind 's rebirth Hel ? M ... Mauser 's got to keep our shields ... shields amped up . Yeah , I know . There 's nothing wrong with her shield . Their weapons use technology they stole from the Bailey . - You son of a ... Hel ! Don 't give them another excuse . Granger , she needs a medical facility now . Spying forfeits that privilege . Sarge ! GUARD : Move . Come on . You 're not getting away with this , Schrager ! MAN : Move it . Come on . Take their weapons for good this time . Argh ! Sarge ? Cleo , help me out . Come on , Sarge , it 's OK . There we go . Easy . OK , Sarge , tell me where . My back . OK . I 'm going to roll you over . On two ? One , two ... You two have got awfully quiet . Sarge ? - I can 't breathe ! - OK , put her on her back . What is it ? Your shield absorbed most of the bolt 's energy . Which is why it didn 't go straight through . But ... But ... the impact collapsed your lung . Is that all ? That 's enough right now . Right now we got to get you breathing . That 's good . Here we go . Almost there . - Got it . - OK , breathe easy . I 'm impressed . Look at her , Cleo . I know what she 's thinking . What was it you used to say ? You 'll never change , Sarge . And it 's gonna get you killed someday . I think you were right . Wrong . That 's not what I was thinking . Liar . No . I was thinking of the countless times you 've saved our lives , just because of the way you are . And you 're never gonna change . Brother ... We 've finally extracted a power cell from a Bailey . SCHRAGER : It should give our device more than enough yield . Did you pinpoint a delivery location ? The underworld . This cabin is deserted . It lies directly over a fault line . We detonate our device there , it 'll destroy the entire infrastructure of the underworld . And the ocean floods the rest . Brother , we knew this day would come . The underworlders have been digging closer every year . Our discovery was only a matter of time . I know . Make the preparations . Sarge , whatcan we do ? Stop squeezing so tight . Sarge ... Sarge , you can 't close your eyes till we tell you . Sarge ! Rose ! I told you never to call me that . You must understand - the illusion of my support for Schrager is the only thing that 's kept you alive . What 's in the case , Cleo ? GRANGER : Please , listen to me ! My brother is preparing to leave for your underworld as we speak . He intends to destroy it . First-aid kit . You still with us , Sarge ? Yeah . Is that the guy who shot me ? No , it 's his brother . Close enough . No , no , no . No . No more . Sarge , I can make the incision larger . It 'll help you breathe . - What , for a few more minutes ? - Yeah . You 're just dragging it out , Hel . Yeah , that 's right . I 'm going to keep dragging it out for as long as it takes . You must be a fun date . Dammit , Sarge . Sarge ? Sarge ? Sarge ? Come on , Sarge . - Come on ! GRANGER : She 's gone . No ! Sarge ? You 've never given up this easily . You sure as heck aren 't going to start now . Cleo , what are you ... ? I was a lifeguard . Great . Keep going . Four , five , six ... Are these biostems ? They 're only temporary neural stabilisers . - Where ? GRANGER : Her head and heart - How ? What ? - Her forehead . Get back ! Clear ! Come on back . I have a pulse ! She needs a healing tube . Where are your medical facilities ? They 're launching the attack from the main hangar . Where 's your medical facility ? Please listen . We do not have time to get her to a medical facility and stop the attack . If nothing else , this you must trust me on , please . And you trust me . I will hurt you . Your gauntlets are under the top tray . Hel ... I want you to go to the door and get the guards . - What ? - Just do it . - Cleo ? - I got her . Guards ! How are we doing , Cleo ? - OK . - Are we close ? Yes , almost there . Leave me . One thing you don 't seem to understand is that we never leave a team member behind . - That is non-negotiable . No ... Oh , shut up . Schrager . GRANGER : We can still stop them . Just show us to our sub . Hel , put me down ! You 'll be all right . Sarge ? We 're almost out of here . I know I am . God , you just don 't listen , do you ? We 're leaving here as a team . Yeah , Sarge . One for all and all for one , remember ? I know you 're probably tired of me saying that No , it 's good . Sarge ? Sarge ? - Sarge ? - I 'm OK ! You 're OK ! You 're OK ! Come on . - It 's good to have you back . - It 's good to be back . So ... - Do you know what happened ? - Yeah , I do . Then what was it about ? It needs us to help them . It wants us to vaporise its remains . They 've taken enough information . Want to go save the world ? Yeah . With this device , we secure the destiny chosen for us by our forefathers . Your work is complete . Let us now rejoin the sea . My brother ? I didn 't expect you to witness our efforts first-hand . I 'm not here to bear witness , Schrager . I can 't allow this . You can 't ? It 's already done . Our ancestors may have been revolutionaries , but mass murder they 'd never have condoned . Nor would they have tolerated the mindless rantings ... .. of a traitor . Stop the device , Schrager . I wouldn 't , even if I could . I 've lost my only brother today . It appears you never had one . Get the door ! I 've seen that before . I 'll disarm it . - The Bailey told you ? - Uh-huh . Go . We 'll take them out . Go , go , go ! I can do this , I can do this ! Hold these . Hold these . Watch that ! - Cleo ! - I 'm almost there ! Come on , Sarge . I 'm not losing you twice in one day . I 'm not done with him yet . Urgh ! Oh , I got it ! Give me your other hand . Why ? You have betrayed us all , Granger ! Goodbye , brother . Granger , come with us . - I 've got to get back . - To what ? You 've betrayed your people . There are those that might listen . Strange as this sounds , I still hope that one day our two worlds can live in harmony . One day . - Hello . - Hey . Analysis complete . There was nothing to heal . No trauma whatsoever . Extraordinary . So , any theories why the Bailies saved Sarge 's life ? Well , she was the extra fire power we needed to stop them from acquiring any more technologies from the Bailies . That doesn 't make sense . The freaks were set to destroy the underground . Isn 't that what the Bailies want ? I don 't know . Is it ? Who cares ? Give me some love . Would you guys lose all respect for me if I cried ? Again ? Don 't be sarcastic .
